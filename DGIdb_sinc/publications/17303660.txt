 xxxd3495xxx  (avp) is known to be involved in maintaining glucose homeostasis, and avp-resistance is observed
in poorly controlled non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
subjects, resulting in a lowered plasma volume. recently we
reported that  xxxg229xxx -deficient (v1arⴚ/ⴚ)
mice exhibited a decreased circulating blood volume and hypermetabolism of fat accompanied with impaired insulin-signaling. here we further investigated the roles of the avp/v1a
receptor in regulating glucose homeostasis and plasma volume using v1arⴚ/ⴚ mice. the plasma glucose levels at the
baseline or during a glucose tolerance test were higher in
v1arⴚ/ⴚ than wild-type (wt) mice. moreover, a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp revealed that the glucose infusion
rate was significantly lower in v1arⴚ/ⴚ mice than in wt mice
and that hepatic glucose production was higher in v1arⴚ/ⴚ
mice than wt mice. in contrast to the increased hepatic glu-

a

rginine-vasopressin (avp) is a neuropeptide
hormone that is involved in diverse functions, including the regulation of osmotic homeostasis, vasoconstriction,
and acth release. these physiological effects are mediated
by three types of avp receptors, designated as v1a, v1b, and
v2 (1–3). the  xxxg229xxx  is widely expressed, whereas the
v1b and v2 receptors are predominantly expressed in the
anterior pituitary and the kidney, respectively (1– 4). the
functional role of the  xxxg229xxx  is considered to mediate
vascular contraction (5), cellular proliferation (6), platelet
aggregation (7), and glycogenolysis (1, 8). the  xxxg230xxx 
stimulates acth and insulin release (9, 10). both v1a and
v1b receptors bind to the gq protein and act through phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis to mobilize intercellular ca2⫹
(11, 12). the  xxxg231xxx  is coupled with the gs protein and
stimulates adenylate cyclase to increase cellular camp,
which results in the induction of an antidiuretic effect in the
kidney (13).
there have been several reports indicating the involvement of avp in regulating the plasma glucose homeostasis.
the plasma avp level was increased in patients with insulinfirst published online february 15, 2007

cose production, the liver glycogen content was decreased in
the mutant mice. these results indicated that the mutant mice
had impaired glucose tolerance. furthermore, feeding
v1arⴚ/ⴚ mice a high-fat diet accompanied by increased calorie intake resulted in significantly overt obesity in comparison with wt mice. in addition, we found that the circulating
plasma volume and aldosterone level were decreased in
v1arⴚ/ⴚ mice, although the plasma avp level was increased.
these results suggested that the effect of avp on water recruitment was disturbed in v1arⴚ/ⴚ mice. thus, we demonstrated that one of the avp-resistance conditions resulting
from deficiency of the  xxxg229xxx  leads to decreased plasma
volume as well as impaired glucose homeostasis, which can
progress to obesity under conditions of increased calorie
intake. (endocrinology 148: 2075–2084, 2007)

dependent diabetes mellitus ( xxxg1193xxx ) or non- xxxg1193xxx 
(niddm) (14, 15), and treating these subjects with insulin or
sulfonylurea improved not only the plasma glucose level but
also the plasma avp level (16, 17). in addition, the binding
activity of avp to the liver, in which the v1a receptors were
predominantly expressed, decreased in the ob/ob mice and
the  xxxd3249xxx -induced diabetes mellitus rat, whereas the
binding activity to the kidney, in which the v2 receptors were
predominantly expressed, was not altered (18, 19). in addition, the antidiuretic or hepatic function of avp was attenuated in human and rodent subjects with  xxxg1193xxx  or niddm
(20 –22). these findings suggest that the altered glucose homeostasis could occasionally result in or from avp resistance
(20 –22), which is, in part, mediated via the  xxxg229xxx ,
although the mechanisms remain to be elucidated.
we generated  xxxg229xxx -deficient ( xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺) mice and
revealed that the insulin-induced akt phosphorylation was
suppressed in adipocytes isolated from  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, suggesting that whole-body glucose tolerance was altered in
 xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice (23). in addition, we found that the circulating
blood volume and blood pressure were decreased in mutant
mice (24). by monitoring urine excretion, we found that there
was no significant difference between wild-type (wt) and
 xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice in urine excretion during water loading in
response to stimulation with a  xxxg231xxx -selective agonist,
suggesting that the antidiuretic effect through the  xxxg231xxx  remains intact (24). the  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice also showed a
decreased level of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (anp)
(24). the level of plasma anp, which is a clinically available
marker for the diagnosis of an appropriate plasma volume
during dialysis, is known to correlate positively with the

plasma volume (25) and negatively with the body mass index
(26, 27). these findings raise the possibility that, in the case
of  xxxg229xxx  deficiency, altered body fluid homeostasis
and the anp level could affect glucose homeostasis and
energy expenditure.
in the present study, we analyzed the indicators for glucose homeostasis under a condition with a normal chow
(nc) diet or a high-fat (hf) diet. our results indicate that the
abolished avp function via the  xxxg229xxx  could be involved in the development of the metabolic syndrome.

trifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4 c, and the supernatants were
collected and stored at ⫺80 c. plasma glucose and bun were measured
by spectrophotometry using a commercially available kit (wako,
osaka, japan). the levels of plasma insulin, anp, leptin, aldosterone,
and avp were determined using elisa kits (insulin; mercodia, uppsala, sweden; anp; phoenix pharmaceuticals, belmont, ca; leptin;
morinaga, tokyo, japan; aldosterone; cayman chemical, ann arbor,
mi; avp; r&d systems, minneapolis, mn). the hematocrit value was
determined using a heparinized-microcapillary tube (drummond,
broomall, pa).

materials and methods

mice were fasted for 16 h before receiving an ip administration of 1.5 g
glucose per kilogram body weight in saline (0.9% nacl). blood samples
were taken from the tail vein at 0, 10, 30, 60, and 120 min in heparinaized
microcapillary tubes, and the plasma glucose and insulin levels were
determined.

animals
the generation of  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice has been described previously (23).
non- xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mouse littermates (wt) were used as age-matched control subjects for  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice. the genetic background of wt and
 xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice was a mixture of 129sv and c57back/6j mice. animals
were housed in microisolator cages in a pathogen-free barrier facility.
wt and  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice were housed under a controlled condition at 23 ⫾
1 c with 50 ⫾ 10% relative humidity on a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle with
ad libitum access to food and water except when the experimental protocol specified otherwise. animals were used at 4 –20 wk of age and
fasted for 16 h before the studies. all data presented here were obtained
from male mice. all experimentation was performed under approved
institutional guidelines.

feeding and weighing
male wt and  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice were weighed once weekly from weaning at 4 wk of age. the mice were housed individually and allowed to
acclimatize for a week. at 5 wk of age, the mice were placed on pellets
of a nc diet consisting of 24.9% protein, 51.4% carbohydrate, and 4.6%
fat (wt/wt/wt) (ce-2, 346.8 kcal per 100 g; clea, tokyo, japan) or a hf
diet consisting of 25.5% protein, 29.4% carbohydrate, and 32.0% fat
(wt/wt/wt) (hfd-32, 507.6 kcal per 100 g; clea). the food was
weighed daily over a period of 15 wk, and food intake was determined
over the time period of 5–19 wk of age.

measurement of food intake volume
daily food consumption in male wt and  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice at 8 wk of
age was measured using a metabolic cage (shinano, tokyo, japan). mice
were housed in the metabolic cage for 3 d to adapt to the new environment, and mice with normal body weight were then used for the
measurement of food intake.

measurements of epididymal-white adipose tissue (wat)
weight and adipocyte diameter
for preparing samples, mice were anesthetized by etherization. epididymal wat was excised from 16-h-fasted mice fed the nc or hf diet
and then weighed. the wat to body weight ratios were calculated and
expressed as the percentage of body weight. the adipocyte diameter was
measured using prepared wat sections on a microscope.

tissue section staining
paraffin sections of the liver and wat were stained using hematoxylin-eosin (he) reagents (muto chemicals, tokyo, japan) or periodic
acid shiff reagents (muto chemicals) to visualize the glycogen granules.

measurement of plasma parameters
for the measurement of the plasma glucose levels, blood samples (10
␮l) were immediately mixed with 10 volumes of 0.33 m hclo4 to inhibit
the use of glucose before measurement. the mixtures were centrifuged
at 3000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatants (10 ␮l) were taken up, and the
glucose concentration was determined with an identically treated standard. for the measurement of the levels of blood urea nitrogen (bun),
insulin, anp, leptin, aldosterone, and avp, blood samples were cen-

glucose tolerance test (gtt)

hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp study
a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp test was performed using
[3-3h] glucose (perkinelmer inc., wellesley, ma) for the estimation of
whole glucose appearance and hepatic glucose production as previously
described (28 –30). operations were carried out under 50 mg/kg pentobarbital (dainippon sumitomo pharma co., ltd., osaka, japan) anesthesia, and a catheter (a stretched pe-10 polyethylene tube connected
with a pe-50 polyethylene tube; becton dickinson, franklin lakes, nj)
filled with heparin solution was inserted in the left internal jugular vein.
the catheters were externalized through an incision in the skin flap
behind its head, and animals were returned to individual cages after the
surgery. after 3 d for complete recovery, mice were fasted overnight,
and conscious mice were placed in a restrainer to which they had
adapted. insulin and [3-3h] glucose were infused at a rate of 15 pmol/
kg䡠min and 0.1 ␮ci/min, respectively, and an infusion rate of 50%
glucose was regulated to maintain euglycemia (120 –140 mg/dl). a
steady-state of clamp was achieved within 90 –120 min. blood samples
were taken from the tail tip  xxxd1891xxx -min intervals, and the plasma glucose
concentration was determined. for the immediate measurement of the
plasma glucose level, we used the ascensia blood glucose meter (bayer
healthcare, leverkusen, germany). for the determination of the plasma
[3-3h] glucose concentration, 12 ␮l of plasma samples were deproteinized with 0.3 n ba(oh)2 and 0.3 n znso4, dried to remove 3h2o,
resuspended in water, and counted using a scintillation counter. the
clamp whole glucose appearance (micromoles per minute) was calculated as the ratio of the [3-3h] glucose infusion rate (disintegrations per
minute per minute) to the specific activity of plasma glucose (disintegrations per minute per micromole) during the final 30 min of the clamp.
hepatic glucose production during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic
clamp was determined by subtracting the glucose infusion rate from the
whole glucose appearance.

measurement of the tissue glycogen content
the total cellular glycogen content was assessed using a  xxxg1401xxx  method (31). liver samples were digested in an sodium dodecyl
sulfate buffer and centrifuged to obtain the digested supernatant. glycogen was digested using 1 u/ml  xxxg1401xxx  (wako) in a 0.05 m
acetate buffer (ph 5.5) for 30 min at 37 c. after digestion of the glucose
from glycogen, sample buffers were neutralized using 0.1 m naoh, and
the glucose concentration was then measured. glucose released from
glycogen was measured by spectrophotometry with a commercially
available kit (wako) and expressed as micrograms glucose per milligram protein. undigested samples were used for background
subtraction.

statistical analysis
all values are expressed as means ⫾ se. statistical analysis was
performed using the two-way anova. p ⬍ 0.05 by the unpaired student’s t test or unpaired welch’s t test was considered statistically
significant.

results
plasma parameters (glucose, insulin) and glucose tolerance

because increased plasma avp level and decreased binding activity of avp to the liver have been observed in
niddm subjects (14 –22), we determined the plasma glucose
level in male wt and  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice at 8 wk of age. the
glucose level was slightly increased in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ under the
fasting condition (82.66 ⫾ 3.88 mg/dl in wt mice, n ⫽ 31, vs.
103.38 ⫾ 10.17 mg/dl in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, n ⫽ 20, p ⫽ 0.0686),
and the differences were more remarkable under the feeding
condition (135.88 ⫾ 3.74 mg/dl in wt mice, n ⫽ 30, vs.
153.17 ⫾ 6.88 mg/dl in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, n ⫽ 21, p ⫽ 0.0346)
(fig. 1a). after a 16-h fast, the plasma insulin level in
 xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice was not significantly different from that in
wt mice (613.98 ⫾ 50.88 pg/ml in wt mice, n ⫽ 27, vs.
558.46 ⫾ 60.26 pg/ml in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, n ⫽ 25, p ⫽ 0.482)
(fig. 1c). because the plasma glucose level was higher in
 xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice than wt mice, we then performed a gtt to
investigate whether the glucose tolerance was altered in
 xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice. after ip loading with 1.5 g/kg body weight
of glucose to male mice at 8 wk of age, the plasma glucose
level in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice was significantly higher than that in
wt mice  xxxd1891xxx , 30, 60, and 120 min after a glucose injection
(fig. 1b).
in a different set of experiments, we performed another
gtt with sampling at only 0 and 30 min to minimize the
sampling stress for mice. impaired glucose tolerance in
 xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice was also observed (glucose level at 0 min;
80.00 ⫾ 4.02 mg/dl in wt, n ⫽ 7, vs. 86.8 ⫾ 8.36 mg/dl in
 xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, n ⫽ 7, p ⫽ 0.492, glucose level at 30 min;
207.14 ⫾ 17.85 mg/dl in wt mice, n ⫽ 7, vs. 326.60 ⫾ 26.01
mg/dl in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, n ⫽ 7, p ⫽ 0.00595). thus, the results
of all these experiments demonstrate that glucose tolerance
is impaired in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice. on the other hand, the plasma
insulin levels were not different between wt and  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺
mice (fig. 1c). these data suggested that the glucose tolerance was altered by the decreased insulin sensitivity in
 xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice because the plasma glucose level in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺
mice was higher despite the similar plasma insulin level
during the gtt.
to further investigate the insulin sensitivity in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺
mice, we performed the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp
study with conscious wt and  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice at 8 wk of age.

the plasma glucose levels and whole glucose appearance
during the steady-state of clamp were not different between
wt and  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice (clamp plasma glucose, 140.68 ⫾ 4.89
mg/dl in wt mice, n ⫽ 8, vs. 139.43 ⫾ 3.21 mg/dl in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺
mice, n ⫽ 8; whole glucose appearance, 263.30 ⫾ 30.21 ␮mol/
kg䡠min in wt mice, vs. 278.58 ⫾ 41.41 ␮mol/kg䡠min in
 xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice) (fig. 2a). the glucose infusion rate during
the steady-state of clamp was significantly lower in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺
mice than wt mice (251.23 ⫾ 32.06 ␮mol/kg䡠min in wt mice
vs. 160.89 ⫾ 14.74 ␮mol/kg䡠min in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, p ⫽
0.0287), suggesting that  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice are insulin resistant
(fig. 2b).
hepatic glucose production and glycogen level in the liver

because a rodent subject with niddm showed increased
hepatic glucose production and reciprocally reduced glycogen granules in the liver (32), we evaluated hepatic glucose
production in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice using the hyperinsulinemiceuglycemic clamp study. the hepatic glucose production
was calculated by subtraction of the glucose infusion rate
from the whole glucose appearance.  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice showed
significantly higher hepatic glucose production during the
steady-state of clamp (12.07 ⫾ 8.28 ␮mol/kg䡠min in wt mice
vs. 117.70 ⫾ 32.21 ␮mol/kg䡠min in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, p ⫽ 0.0132)
(fig. 2c), which suggested that glycogenolysis was increased
in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice. to confirm the increased glycogenolysis in
 xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, we measured the hepatic glycogen level using several universal methods, such as the amylase method
and staining for glycogen granules. the liver glycogen content in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice was significantly lower than that in wt
mice (232.21 ⫾ 30.78 ␮g/mg protein in wt mice, n ⫽ 6, vs.
114.05 ⫾ 21.39 ␮g/mg protein in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, n ⫽ 6, p ⫽
0.0117) (fig. 3a). in addition, the staining level of hepatic
glycogen granules was decreased in the liver section of
 xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice (fig. 3b).
growth curve on the hf diet

next, we performed a hf diet loading test to confirm the
impaired glucose tolerance in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice. growth curves
were measured from 4 to 19 wk of age in male wt and
 xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice. the mice were fed a nc or hf diet from the

the nc diet; wt mice, n ⫽ 14, and  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, n ⫽ 10 on
the hf diet). wt mice on the nc diet (fig. 4, a and b) were
significantly heavier than  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice at 19 wk of age
(body weight, 33.53 ⫾ 0.72 g in wt mice vs. 28.38 ⫾ 0.63 g
in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, p ⫽ 3.92 ⫻ 10⫺5), and the average weight
gain (5–19 wk) was significantly less in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice than
in wt mice (11.17 ⫾ 0.44 g in wt mice vs. 5.25 ⫾ 0.54 g in
 xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, p ⫽ 1.97 ⫻ 10⫺8). in contrast,  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice
on the hf diet were significantly heavier than wt mice at 19
wk of age (body weight, 38.71 ⫾ 2.00 g in wt mice vs. 47.27 ⫾
1.86 g in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, p ⫽ 0.00651) (fig. 4, a and b).
whereas the weight gains resulting from the hf diet were
significantly increased in both mice, compared with those
resulting from the nc diet, the average weight gain (from 5
to 19 wk) was greater in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice than in wt mice
(16.25 ⫾ 1.58 g in wt mice vs. 24.01 ⫾ 1.76 g in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice,
p ⫽ 0.00376).
wat weight and plasma leptin level of mice on the hf diet

to investigate which body tissues were responsible for this
increased weight, after mice had been fed the hf diet for 15
wk, tissues were collected from a subset of both mice. as
shown in table 1 and fig. 4c, at 20 wk of age,  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice
showed a remarkable increase in epididymal-wat depots,
compared with wt on hf diets, consistent with the increase
in body weight (0.83 ⫾ 0.095 g in wt mice vs. 2.89 ⫾ 0.21 g
in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, p ⫽ 9.44 ⫻ 10⫺7). the weight of brown
adipose tissue, sc wat, retroperitoneal wat, and visceral
wat yielded the same results (data not shown). there was
no significant difference in the liver, kidney, and heart
weight (data not shown). the  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice on both the nc
and hf diets had significantly greater adiposity in the epididymal wat (measured as the percentage of body weight).
in good agreement with the increased adiposity, the adipocyte diameters in epididymal wat were larger in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺
mice than wt mice on the nc or hf diet.
because the plasma leptin level is known to be highly
correlated with the adipose tissue mass, we measured the
leptin level in these animals on the corresponding diets (33,
34) (fig. 4d). the plasma leptin level was significantly higher
in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice than that in wt mice on the nc diet (1.80 ⫾
0.52 ng/ml in wt mice vs. 4.19 ⫾ 1.06 ng/ml in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺
mice, p ⫽ 0.0334), whereas it tended to be increased in
 xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice on the hf diet (10.69 ⫾ 2.53 ng/ml in wt mice
vs. 13.70 ⫾ 2.52 ng/ml in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, p ⫽ 0.271).
glucose tolerance on the hf diet

because altered glucose tolerance was observed in
 xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice on the nc diet, we also investigated the

effects on glucose homeostasis of feeding wt and
 xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice an hf diet. we assessed the basal plasma
glucose and insulin levels of mice at 19 wk of age under
a fasting or feeding condition with the hf diet. the plasma
glucose levels of  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice were significantly higher
than those of wt mice under the fasting or feeding condition (fasting, 88.50 ⫾ 4.92 mg/dl in wt mice, n ⫽ 14, vs.
112.40 ⫾ 6.39 mg/dl in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, n ⫽ 10, p ⫽ 0.00635;
feeding, 159.50 ⫾ 6.09 mg/dl in wt mice, n ⫽ 14, vs.
195.80 ⫾ 10.90 mg/dl in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, n ⫽ 10, p ⫽
0.00505), whereas the fasting insulin levels were not different between wt and  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice on the hf diet (fig.
5, a and b). the fasting glucose levels were significantly
elevated in both mice on the hf diet, compared with those
of mice on the nc diet. furthermore, the plasma glucose
levels of wt or  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice on the hf diet during the
gtt were significantly elevated, compared with those of
wt or  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ on the nc diet, as assessed by two-way
anova (nc in wt mice vs. hf in wt mice, p ⫽ 0.00297;

because  xxxg229xxx 
mice were shown to have a decreased
level of circulating blood volume (24), we determined the
hematocrit value, bun level, plasma avp level, and plasma
aldosterone level (table 2). the hematocrit value, bun level,
and plasma avp level were significantly increased in
 xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice. the plasma anp level was significantly decreased in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, as described previously (24). the
plasma aldosterone level was also significantly decreased in
 xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice (table 2). these results indicated that blockade of the  xxxg229xxx  led to a reduced plasma aldosterone
level and plasma volume, which could cause decreased circulating blood volume and increased avp release.

discussion

avp resistance is reported to consist of decreased plasma
volume, hypervasopressinemia, and reduced coupling of
avp for the  xxxg229xxx  in the liver and kidney and to be
accompanied with human or rodent niddm, especially under a poorly controlled condition (14 –22). these reports suggest that the alteration of avp signaling could mediate the
development of a metabolic syndrome. recently we reported
that the akt phosphorylation induced by insulin was reduced in primary adipocytes isolated from  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice,
suggesting that whole body glucose tolerance was altered in
 xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice (27). therefore, we investigated the glucose
homeostasis in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice by assessing the glucose tol-

erance and found that 8-wk-old  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice that were on
the nc diet showed hyperglycemia and impaired glucose
tolerance, whereas their plasma insulin level was not significantly altered. thus, the phenotype of  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice was
consistent with clinical data from a niddm patient (35), who
showed impaired glucose tolerance and intact insulin secretion. furthermore, insulin resistance observed in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺
mice was supported by a decreased glucose infusion rate in
the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp study. in addition,
we determined the hepatic glucose production rate using a
hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp study and directly estimated the hepatic glycogen content to see whether
 xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice exhibited up-regulation in hepatic glucose
production, as shown in niddm subjects (32). hepatic glucose production in the steady-state of clamp was increased
in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, and, therefore, the glycogen level in the
liver of  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice was reduced by approximately half.
these results indicated that the increased hepatic glucose
production could contribute in part to developing glucose
intolerance in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice. in addition, we performed the
hf diet loading test to confirm the glucose intolerance in
 xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice.  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice on the hf diet, but not wt
mice on the same diet, consequently showed hyperobesity

accompanied with malignant hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, adipocyte hypertrophy, and hyperleptinemia. the
remarkable pathogenesis of fatty liver observed in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺
mice on the hf diet also supported the finding of an impaired
glucose tolerance condition. if results obtained from the
study with gtt were applied to the classification of human
diabetes mellitus presently proposed by american diabetes
association using the data of plasma glucose levels at 0 and
2 h during the gtt (36), abolishing the  xxxg229xxx  would
lead to a shift to the prediabetes mellitus condition, whereas
wt mice would still be classified as being under the normal
condition (fig. 7a). furthermore,  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice on the hf
diet shifted from a prediabetes mellitus to a diabetes mellitus
condition, whereas wt mice on the hf diet had a prediabetes
mellitus condition (fig. 7b).
the food intake of  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice on the nc diet was
approximately 80% less than that of wt mice, and the weight
gain was less in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ than in wt mice on the nc diet.
on the nc diet, hyperglycemia and hyperleptinemia observed in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice might lead to hypophagia, consequently resulting in decreased weight gain in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice
(37). in contrast to  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice on the nc diet,  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺
mice on the hf diet had significantly increased calorie intake
(ratio of calorie intake, 138%), whereas the calorie intake of
wt mice on the hf diet did not differ from that of those on
the nc diet (ratio of calorie intake, 104%). therefore, the
calorie intake in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice was much more elevated than
that in wt mice when the diet was changed from nc to hf.
this increased calorie intake in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice would accelerate the hypertrophy of adipocytes, consequently resulting
in increased weight gain. moreover, scarpace et al. (38) reported that the hf diet-treated rats overexpressing leptin
cdna showed leptin resistance, elevated food intake, and
increased weight gain, compared with the hf diet-treated
rats expressing a control vector. this suggested that leptin
resistance accompanied with hyperleptinemia could prefer-

entially occur in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice on the hf diet. thus, hyperleptinemia in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice fed the hf diet could cause
leptin resistance, leading to elevated food intake and, consequently, increased weight gain.
avp plays a crucial role in regulating body fluid retention,
which is mediated through the  xxxg231xxx  in the kidney (39,
40). because systematic disruption of the  xxxg229xxx  resulted in decreased blood volume and anp levels without
altered  xxxg231xxx  function, the functional role of avp for
body fluid recruitment could be mediated through not only
the  xxxg231xxx  but also the  xxxg229xxx  (23). to assess the
plasma volume, we examined the hematocrit value, bun
level, plasma avp level, and plasma aldosterone level in
 xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice. the hematocrit value and bun level were
increased, suggesting that the plasma volume was decreased
in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice. in addition, the plasma avp level was
increased, and the plasma aldosterone level was decreased in
 xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice. these findings could reflect insufficient water recruitment and an avp-resistant condition in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺
mice. because anp has been known as a mediator for the
translocation of extracellular fluid as well as marker for a
plasma volume (41), decreased plasma volume may be concomitant with decreased extracellular fluid in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice.
taken together, these findings demonstrate that the  xxxg229xxx  is involved in maintaining glucose homeostasis as
well as body fluid homeostasis and that lack of this receptor
could lead to glucose intolerance accompanied with the prediabetes mellitus phenotype despite a lower energy intake.
various sources constituting the mechanisms underlying
the blockade of the  xxxg229xxx  and glucose intolerance
could be used to explain this physiological phenomenon
because the  xxxg229xxx  is widely distributed and its functional role on glucose homeostasis remains unclear (2, 4).
therefore, we propose the following three mechanisms (fig.
7c).
first, the central avp/ xxxg229xxx  signal in the central
nervous system (cns) regulates hepatic glucose production.
avp is well known to stimulate glycogen degradation
through the  xxxg229xxx  (8). therefore, we had expected that
the glycogen content would increase. however, the rate of
hepatic glucose production was increased, and the glycogen
content in the liver of  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice was decreased. because
the avp/ xxxg229xxx  pathway of glycogen degradation in
the liver is abolished in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, other mechanisms
could be involved in regulating hepatic glucose production
in the liver of  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice. in addition to the peripheral
action in the liver, avp is known to act within the cns as
a neuromodulator/neurotransmitter regulating an array of
cns-mediated functions (e.g. learning and memory, neuroendocrine reactivity, social behaviors, circadian rhythmicity, thermoregulation, and autonomic function) (4, 42). it has
also been reported that avp stimulates secretion of ␥- xxxd2177xxx  (gabaergic) neurons in vitro (43) and that
gabaergic neurons suppress hepatic glucose production
(44). thus, central blockade of the  xxxg229xxx  could attenuate the stimulation of gabaergic neurons, resulting in the
up-regulation of hepatic glucose production.
second, avp can stimulate the insulin-signaling pathway
via the  xxxg229xxx . we found that glucose tolerance was
altered by insulin resistance in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice (fig. 2b). avp

aoyagi et al. • glucose intolerance in  xxxg229xxx -ko mice

has been reported to activate insulin-signaling, such as akt
and p70s6kinase, via the epithelial growth factor receptorphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway (45), suggesting that
avp can modulate glucose homeostasis by affecting insulin
signaling. in fact, the phosphorylation of akt was significantly reduced in the adipocytes of  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice (27). thus,
a blunted insulin-signaling pathway due to a deficient avp/
v1a signal could result in reduced glucose uptake in muscles
and adipocytes, leading to insulin resistance and impaired
glucose tolerance.
third, the avp/ xxxg229xxx  signal may regulate glucose
tolerance via body fluid homeostasis.  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice showed
an avp-resistant condition including hypervasopressinemia
and decreased plasma volume. perraudin et al. (46) reported
that avp directly regulated aldosterone secretion through
the  xxxg229xxx , which was expressed in the adrenal cortex.
indeed, the plasma aldosterone level was decreased in
 xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice and supported avp-resistance in mutant
mice. thus, dysfunction of the avp/ xxxg229xxx -aldosterone system in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice could cause a lower response
to water recruitment by aldosterone, leading to decreased
plasma volume. consequently, the decreased plasma volume could result in increased blood glucose level as well as
increased levels of blood solutes, such as hematocrit and
bun. in addition to the lowered plasma volume, the plasma
anp level was decreased in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice. the plasma
volume or osmotic level regulates the plasma anp level,
which is well known as an intensive lipolytic factor (24, 25).
thus, the decreased plasma anp level induced by the lower
plasma volume could cause suppressed lipid degradation of
adipocytes, resulting in hypertrophy of adipose tissue in
 xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice. although no reports have shown that a decreased plasma volume contributes to the development of
diabetes mellitus, it has been reported that a hyperosmolar
condition could influence glucose homeostasis (47–51). the
elevation of plasma osmotic pressure affected glucose tolerance in humans (47, 48). hyperosmolar stimuli can attenuate
the glucose uptake by insulin-stimulated p38mapk activation and akt activation in various tissues (49 –51). these
reports prompted us to consider the relationship between the
attenuation of body fluid homeostasis and whole body glucose intolerance. we revealed that  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice showed
increased plasma glucose and bun levels by 1.2-fold when
individually compared with wt mice. these data are a clinically available indicator for the prediction of plasma osmotic
levels as well as plasma na⫹ and k⫹ concentrations (52).
previously we reported that the plasma na⫹ and k⫹ levels
were not significantly different in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ and wt mice
(23). therefore, the deficiency of the  xxxg229xxx  might lead
to an increase in the plasma osmotic level, resulting in the
promotion of glucose intolerance in  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice.
in our experiments,  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice simultaneously
showed avp resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and
increased hepatic glucose production. this suggests that
avp could be involved in maintaining the homeostasis of
blood glucose by regulating body fluid, hepatic glucose production, and insulin-signaling, such as akt (fig. 7c). moreover, our data suggest that a selective agonist for the v1a
receptor would contribute to the therapeutics for diabetes
mellitus and improve impaired glucose tolerance by increas-

ing the insulin effect, down-regulation of hepatic glucose
production, and recruitment of plasma volume.
in conclusion, our study with  xxxg229xxx ⫺/⫺ mice examined the
contributions of avp to lifestyle-related diseases. we should
clarify the mechanisms underlying the regulation of plasma
recruitment by the avp/ xxxg229xxx  in future studies.
