inhibition of the action of the  xxxg2312xxx  poison  xxxd168xxx  by simple aniline derivatives: evidence for drug-protein interactions.  the action of the anticancer drug  xxxd168xxx  appears to involve molecular interactions with both dna and  xxxg2312xxx . it has been shown previously that dna intercalators can inhibit the action of  xxxd168xxx  and several other  xxxg2312xxx  poisons, presumably as a result of interference with the dna binding sites for the enzyme. we show here that drug molecules such as n-phenylmethanesulfonamide, which mimic the anilino side chain of  xxxd168xxx , inhibit the cytotoxicity against cultured lewis lung murine carcinoma of  xxxd168xxx ,  xxxd168xxx  analogues including  xxxd169xxx  and daca (n-[2-(dimethylamino)-ethyl]acridine-4-carboxamide dihydrochloride), and etoposide. in contrast, the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin was slightly increased by co-incubation with n-phenylmethanesulfonamide. the cytotoxicity of  xxxd168xxx  was also modulated in human jurkat leukemia, hct-8 colon, and ht-29 colon cell lines. because o-amsa, an  xxxd168xxx  analogue containing a methoxy group in the ortho rather than in the meta position, is known to be inactive as an antitumor drug, the abilities of the ortho and meta methoxy-substituted derivatives of methyl-n-phenylcarbamate to reverse the cytotoxicity of  xxxd168xxx ,  xxxd169xxx , and daca were compared. the ortho substitution decreased activity while meta substitution slightly increased it, suggesting that the side chains were binding to a similar site to that occupied by  xxxd168xxx . to determine whether the side chain variants actively inhibited the formation of dna- xxxg2312xxx  covalent complexes, cultured cells were treated with  xxxd168xxx  or  xxxd169xxx , harvested, and lysed directly on acrylamide gels before electrophoresis and western blotting to identify non-dna-bound  xxxg2312xxx . extractable  xxxg2312xxx  was depleted in cells incubated with  xxxd168xxx  but partially restored by coculture with methyl-n-phenylcarbamate. the findings are consistent with the hypothesis that low molecular weight molecules can modulate the effects of  xxxg2312xxx  poisons by directly interacting with the enzyme.
