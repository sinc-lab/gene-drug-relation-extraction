we report an alternative, hydroxylating pathway for the metabolism of
 xxxd2019xxx  in a cytochrome p450 side chain cleavage ( xxxg570xxx ;  xxxg570xxx )
reconstituted system. nmr analyses identiﬁed solely 20-hydroxyvitamin
d2 and 17,20-dihydroxyvitamin d2 derivatives. 20-hydroxyvitamin d2 was
produced at a rate of 0.34 molæmin)1æmol)1  xxxg570xxx , and 17,20-dihydroxyvitamin d2 was produced at a rate of 0.13 molæmin)1æmol)1. in adrenal
mitochondria,  xxxd2019xxx  was metabolized to six monohydroxy products.
nevertheless,  xxxd147xxx  (a  xxxg570xxx  inhibitor) inhibited this adrenal
metabolite formation. initial testing of metabolites for biological
activity showed that, similar to  xxxd2019xxx , 20-hydroxyvitamin d2 and
17,20-dihydroxyvitamin d2 inhibited dna synthesis in human epidermal
hacat keratinocytes, although to a greater degree. 17,20-dihydroxyvitamin d2 stimulated transcriptional activity of the  xxxg1217xxx  promoter, again
to a signiﬁcantly greater extent than  xxxd2019xxx , while the effect of 20-hydroxyvitamin d2 was statistically insigniﬁcant. thus,  xxxg570xxx  can metabolize  xxxd2019xxx  to generate novel products, with intrinsic biological activity
(at least in keratinocytes).

 xxxd2019xxx  ( xxxd2019xxx ) is a product of uvbmediated transformation of ergosterol, a 5,7-diene
phytosterol, which is synthesized by fungi and phytoplankton but not in the animal kingdom [1]. the
physicochemical reactions that generate  xxxd2019xxx 
are similar to those involved in the generation of
 xxxd1682xxx  from  xxxd1682xxx : uvb energy
converts ergosterol into previtamin d2, while thermal
energy (at 37 c) converts previtamin d2 into

 xxxd2019xxx  [1].  xxxd2019xxx  differs from  xxxd1682xxx 
in exhibiting a lesser hypercalcemic effect [2,3], making it a potential precursor for effective drugs in
therapy for cancer [1,3–5], or for proliferative cutaneous diseases [1,6]. such use is based on the nonmetabolic actions of vitamin d apart from its effect
on calcium. these include modulation of immune
and neuroendocrine activities, cellular proliferation,
differentiation and apoptosis in cells of different

lineages, and protection of dna against oxidative
damage and action as a cell membrane antioxidant
[1,3,6,7].
structurally,  xxxd2019xxx  differs from  xxxd1682xxx 
in that its side chain has a c24 methyl group and a
c22–c23 double bound. these features are responsible for the differences in oxidative processes occurring on the side chain relative to those observed for
 xxxd1682xxx  [8,9]. however, the main steps of metabolic conversion of vitamins d3 and d2 in vivo are
mediated by the same enzymes, with similar products
that include 24- and 25-hydroxy derivatives [1,5,
10,11]. these are further hydroxylated at position 1
to generate 1a,24-dihydroxyvitamin d2 and the metabolite with the highest biological activity, 1a,25dihydroxyvitamin d2 [12]. additional hydroxylations produce 1a,24(s),26-trihydroxyvitamin d2 and
1a,24(r),25-trihydroxyvitamin d2, and further hydroxylation at position 26 or 28 results in tetrahydroxyvitamin d2 [12]. 24-hydroxyvitamin d2 and
25-hydroxyvitamin d2 are inactivated through the
transformations to 24(s),26-dihydroxyvitamin d2 and
24(r),25-dihydroxyvitamin d2, respectively [12].
additional derivatives that have been identiﬁed are
generated through other modiﬁcations of the side
chain or of the a-ring [12].
cytochrome  xxxg570xxx  ( xxxg570xxx ) catalyzes the ﬁrst
step in steroid synthesis, the cleavage of the side
chain of cholesterol to produce pregnenolone [13–
15]. this reaction proceeds via the enzyme-bound
reaction intermediates 22r-hydroxycholesterol and
20a,22r-dihydroxycholesterol [13–15]. recently, it
has been demonstrated that in addition to cholesterol,  xxxg570xxx  can also use  xxxd1682xxx ,
 xxxd1682xxx  and ergosterol as substrates [16–19].
 xxxg570xxx  cleaves the side chain of  xxxd1682xxx , producing 7-dehydropregnenolone [18]. with
ergosterol and  xxxd1682xxx ,  xxxg570xxx  hydroxylates the
substrate but cleavage of the side chain is not
observed [17,19].  xxxg570xxx  converts  xxxd1682xxx  to 20hydroxyvitamin d3 and 20,22- xxxd408xxx 
[16,17] and metabolizes ergosterol to 17a,24-dihydroxyergosterol [19]. thus, a new family of metabolites can be generated by the action of  xxxg570xxx , with
the nature of the modiﬁcations differing between
substrates of animal ( xxxd1682xxx  and  xxxd1682xxx ) and plant (ergosterol) origin. to further
characterize these novel metabolic pathways, we have
investigated the action of mammalian cytochrome
 xxxg570xxx  on  xxxd2019xxx , utilizing both puriﬁed
enzyme in a reconstituted system and adrenal mitochondria, with products being identiﬁed by ms and
nmr.

results and discussion
metabolism of  xxxd2019xxx  by purified  xxxg570xxx 
in a reconstituted system
vesicle-reconstituted  xxxg570xxx  metabolized  xxxd2019xxx 
to two novel products as shown by tlc; these were
not seen in control incubations where the electron
source was omitted (fig. 1). as expected, there was
production of a little pregnenolone from cholesterol
that copuriﬁed with bovine  xxxg570xxx , conﬁrming the
side chain-cleaving activity of the enzyme. following
their elution from tlc plates, both  xxxd2019xxx  metabolites displayed uv absorbance corresponding to an
intact vitamin d chromophore (kmax at 265 nm and
kmin at 228 nm). for metabolite 1, the molecular ion
had m ⁄ z ¼ 412 with fragment ions m ⁄ z ¼ 394
(412—h2o), m ⁄ z ¼ 379 (394—ch3), m ⁄ z ¼ 376
(412—2h2o) and m ⁄ z ¼ 361 (379—h2o). the molecular ion of metabolite 2 had m ⁄ z ¼ 428, with fragment ions at m ⁄ z ¼ 410 (428—h2o), m ⁄ z ¼ 392
(428—2h2o), m ⁄ z ¼ 395 (410—ch3) and m ⁄ z ¼ 377
(428—2h2o–ch3). since  xxxd2019xxx  has m ⁄ z ¼ 396,
metabolite 1 was identiﬁed as hydroxyvitamin d2, and
metabolite 2 as dihydroxyvitamin d2 (fig. 1c).
identification of the structure of  xxxd2019xxx 
metabolites
incubation of  xxxg570xxx  (2.0 lm) with  xxxd2019xxx  in
phospholipid vesicles (40 ml) for 1 h produced 70 lg
of tlc-puriﬁed hydroxyvitamin d2 (4% yield) and
60 lg of tlc-puriﬁed dihydroxyvitamin d2 (3.3%
yield). products from two 40 ml incubations were
pooled and used for structural analysis by nmr.
identiﬁcation of metabolite 1 was accomplished by
analysis of proton 1d, cosy and proton–carbon
correlation spectroscopy (hsqc) spectra of this
compound and of parent  xxxd2019xxx  (fig. 2). the
high-order pattern in proton nmr of  xxxd2019xxx  at
5.19 p.p.m. (22-ch) and 5.20 p.p.m. (23-ch) became
separated to 5.54 p.p.m. (22-ch) and 5.42 p.p.m. (23ch) in metabolite 1 (fig. 2, projections on cosy
spectra). the scalar coupling between 22-ch and 20ch did not exist in this metabolite (fig. 2b). at the
same time, the doublet of the 21-methyl in  xxxd2019xxx 
(proton at 1.01 p.p.m. and carbon at 21.2 p.p.m.;
fig. 2c) became a singlet in metabolite 1 with a downﬁeld shift (proton at 1.30 p.p.m. and carbon at
29.5 p.p.m.; fig. 2d), also indicating the removal of
scalar coupling from 20-ch. other regions of the spectra are similar between  xxxd2019xxx  and metabolite 1.
all these changes can be readily explained by the

impurities present in metabolite 1 have strong nmr
signals in the low chemical shift region but not in the
high chemical shift region, and they probably derive
from the tlc plate used in the puriﬁcation process.
the hsqc spectrum of the methyl region in metabolite 2 was cleaner and similar to that of metabolite
1, indicating the presence of 20-oh and no other
hydroxyl group on the side chain (fig. 3d). the
a-ring and double bond linker were also intact in this
metabolite, indicating that the second hydroxylation is

either at the b-ring or at the c-ring (fig. 3). the wellisolated proton nmr signals of 9-ch2 (1.68 p.p.m.
and 2.82 p.p.m.) have very similar position and coupling patterns in  xxxd2019xxx  and metabolite 2, indicating that the b-ring stays intact. therefore, the second
hydroxylation must occur in the c-ring. the 14-ch in
this metabolite has a large downﬁeld shift in its proton
nmr (1.99 p.p.m. in  xxxd2019xxx  and 2.68 p.p.m. in
metabolite 2; fig. 3a and fig. 3b), while the proton
nmr of the 17-ch in the  xxxd2019xxx  standard at
1.32 p.p.m. disappeared. the shift of the 14-ch is

methyl regions are probably from the tlc purification process.

caused by the formation of 17-oh in this metabolite.
hence, this dihydroxylated metabolite is most likely to
be 17,20-dihydroxyvitamin d2.
we have therefore shown that  xxxg570xxx  hydroxylates
 xxxd2019xxx , and generates hydroxyvitamin d2 and
dihydroxyvitamin d2 as main products in approximately equivalent amounts. nmr analysis further
showed that these products correspond to 20-hydroxyvitamin d2 and 17,20-dihydroxyvitamin d2, and also
revealed that the initial hydroxylation occurs at position 20, and is followed by a second hydroxylation at
c17 (fig. 4). the explanation for hydroxylation in
these positions lies in the structure of  xxxd2019xxx ,
2894

which has a c22–c23 double bond that both prevents
hydroxylation at c22 and apparently limits hydroxylation of the side chain to c20. hydroxylation of the
c-ring at position 17 indicates a shift in substrate orientation in the active site, as compared to cholesterol,
 xxxd1682xxx , or 24a-methylcholesterol (campesterol),
where  xxxg570xxx  is free to hydroxylate at c20 and c22
[16,17,20]. interestingly, ergosterol (provitamin d2) is
hydroxylated at c17 similar to  xxxd2019xxx , but the
second hydroxylation is at c24 rather than c20 [19].
the detected accumulation of 20-hydroxyvitamin d2
(fig. 1a) suggests that it can be released from the
active site of  xxxg570xxx , with only a portion remaining

in the side chain as indicated by cosy and hsqc. the large downfield shift of 14-ch from 1.99 p.p.m. to 2.68 p.p.m. with disappearance

c17. this is again in contrast to the  xxxg570xxx -mediated
metabolism of ergosterol, where the accumulation of
monohydroxy product is only minor, and also in contrast to the conversion of cholesterol into pregnenolone, where hydroxycholesterol intermediates are not
normally released [20,21].

5 min at 35 c. the 20-hydroxyvitamin d2 and 17,20dihydroxyvitamin d2 products were extracted, puriﬁed
by tlc and quantitated from their absorbance at
264 nm. 20-hydroxyvitamin d2 was produced at a rate
of 0.34 molæmin)1æmol)1  xxxg570xxx , and 17,20-dihydroxyvitamin d2 was produced at a rate of 0.13 molæmin)1æ
mol)1  xxxg570xxx . under similar conditions, this preparation of  xxxg570xxx  converted cholesterol to pregnenolone
at a rate of 14.4 molæmin)1æmol)1  xxxg570xxx . the rate of
hydroxylation of  xxxd2019xxx  by  xxxg570xxx  is slightly
lower than the rate of hydroxylation of its precursor,
ergosterol [19].

 xxxd2019xxx  metabolism by adrenal mitochondria
to evaluate the biological relevance of the above ﬁndings, we incubated puriﬁed adrenal mitochondria,
which contain a high concentration of  xxxg570xxx , with
 xxxd2019xxx . tests were performed in the presence
(experimental) or absence (control) of nadph and
isocitrate. when the reaction products were subjected
to lc ⁄ ms or lc with uv spectral analysis, we detected six new products by monitoring at 265 nm of
hplc-separated fractions (fig. 5). these products had
uv absorbance spectra characteristic of the vitamin d
triene, with kmax at 265 nm and kmin at 228 nm, and
displayed a molecular ion [m + 1]+ at m ⁄ z ¼ 413 and
a major fragment ion at m ⁄ z ¼ 395 (413—h2o), indicating that they represent isomers of hydroxyvitamin
d2 (not shown). the molecular ion [m + 1]+ for  xxxd2019xxx  (not shown) had the expected m ⁄ z ¼ 397.
to further study the possible involvement of
 xxxg570xxx  in the formation of the  xxxd2019xxx  metabolites,  xxxd147xxx , a speciﬁc inhibitor of cytochrome  xxxg570xxx  in rat adrenal mitochondria [22,23],
was added to the reaction mixture. the formation of
the unknown metabolites 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 decreased in
a parallel fashion (fig. 5c). more profound inhibition
was observed in the case of metabolite 4, which suggests that it represents 20-hydroxyvitamin d2. this
provides further evidence that  xxxd2019xxx  hydroxylation in adrenal mitochondria is catalyzed by  xxxg570xxx ,
especially for production of metabolite 4 (putative
20-hydroxyvitamin d2).

media at a concentration of 10)10 m. this caused inhibition of dna synthesis, signiﬁcantly greater than that
seen with  xxxd2019xxx  itself (fig. 6a). a similar inhibitory effect of both hydroxy metabolites was also seen
in an additional independent experiment (not shown).
we also tested for an effect of hydroxyvitamin d2
products on keratinocyte differentiation, with vitamin
d2 and 5 mm ca2+ as positive controls. this was done
using the ﬁreﬂy luciferase reporter gene plasmid ivlluc, containing the  xxxg1217xxx  gene promoter region
()668 bp to + 34 bp) (fig. 6b). since involucin
expression is characteristically proportional to keratinocyte differentiation [24–28], these assays are typically used in models testing for keratinocyte

differentiation [24]. all of the tested compounds stimulated transcriptional activity of the  xxxg1217xxx  promoter; the most signiﬁcant effects were shown by
ca2+ and 17,20-dihydroxyvitamin d2, which simulated
luciferase activity 25-fold and 12-fold, respectively
(fig. 6b). the stimulatory effect of 17,20-dihydroxyvitamin d2 was signiﬁcantly higher than that of
 xxxd2019xxx  (p < 0.05), while the effect of 20-hydroxyvitamin d2 on  xxxg1217xxx  promoter activity was statistically insigniﬁcant (p > 0.05). thus, the data above
indicate that  xxxd2019xxx  can be converted to product(s)
of higher biological activity by  xxxg570xxx .

conclusions
the novel hydroxylating activity of mammalian
 xxxg570xxx  towards  xxxd2019xxx  to generate 20-monohydroxyvtamin d2 and 17,20-dihydroxyvitamin d2 raises
questions of a new role for this enzyme and on the
biological activity of its products. it was previously
shown that  xxxg570xxx  cleaves the side chain of  xxxd1682xxx  to produce 7-dehydropregnenolone
[16,18], that it hydroxylates  xxxd1682xxx  to 20shydroxyvitamin d3 and 20,22- xxxd408xxx 
[17], and that it hydroxylates ergosterol to 24-monohydroxyergosterol and 17a,24-dihydroxyergosterol [19].
thus, it is becoming apparent that metabolism by
mammalian  xxxg570xxx  opens novel pathways, where processing is determined by both substrate structure (5,7dienes vs. secosteroids) and origin (animal kingdom vs.
fungi or phytoplankton). the human disease, smith
lemli opitz syndrome, illustrates the signiﬁcance of
the former pathway; defective 7-delta reductase leads
to excessive accumulation of 7-dehydropregnenolone
and its hydroxy derivatives, with characteristic pathologic features [29,30]. conversely, in the case of  xxxd1682xxx ,  xxxg570xxx  action may prevent its sequential
transformation to bioactive calcitriol, although the
activity of the alternative products remains to be tested
[17]. the transformation of ergosterol [19] results in
distinct products that are also biologically active. both
20-monohydroxyvitamin d2 and 17,20-dihydroxyvitamin d2 inhibit proliferation of human keratinocytes to
a greater degree than  xxxd2019xxx  itself, while only
17,20-dihydroxyvitamin d2 is able to stimulate activity
of the  xxxg1217xxx  promoter (higher than  xxxd2019xxx ).
thus, both products show biological activity, differentially expressed depending on the phenotypic feature
measured. within the context of the recently described
pleiotropic activity of vitamin d [1,4,5], the new hydroxy derivatives of  xxxd2019xxx  could have a place in
the management of epithelial hyperproliferative disorders or skin diseases. this may be particularly

important when considering the limitation in clinical
use imposed by the potentially toxic hypercalcemic
action [1,4,5]. since  xxxd2019xxx  is absorbed by the alimentary tract, it could be metabolized in any organ
expressing high levels of  xxxg570xxx , such as adrenal
glands (see above), gonads [31] or placenta [32], raising
the possibility of additional systemic effects. organs
expressing low levels of  xxxg570xxx , which include brain
[33], gastrointestinal tract [34], kidney [35], and skin
[18], could alternatively produce and use the same metabolites in local paracrine, autocrine or intracrine
roles.
our previous work [17–19] and current ﬁndings have
clearly uncovered a new biological signiﬁcance for an
ancient enzyme, cytochrome  xxxg570xxx . we have shown
that  xxxg570xxx  opens new metabolic pathways, thus generating novel steroidal and secosteroidal derivatives.
of these, some have already been shown to possess
biological activity ( xxxd2019xxx  and ergosterol hydroxy
derivatives), while for others the biological activity
remains to be deﬁned.

experimental procedures
enzymatic assays
metabolism of  xxxd2019xxx  by purified cytochrome
 xxxg570xxx 
the detailed methodology has been described before [17].
brieﬂy, bovine cytochrome  xxxg570xxx  and adrenododoxin
reductase were isolated from adrenals [36,37].  xxxg779xxx 
was expressed in esccherichia coli and puriﬁed as previously
described [38]. the reaction mixture comprised 510 lm
phospholipid vesicles (dioleoyl pc plus 15 mol% cardiolipin) with a  xxxd2019xxx  ⁄ phospholipid molar ratio of 0.2,
50 lm nadph, 2 mm  xxxd1292xxx , 2 uæml)1
 xxxg825xxx , 0.3 lm  xxxg779xxx 
reductase, 6.5 lm  xxxg779xxx , 3.0 lm cytochrome  xxxg570xxx 
and buffer ph 7.4. after incubation at 35 c for 3 h, the
mixture was extracted with methylene chloride and dried
under nitrogen. products were analyzed and puriﬁed by preparative tlc on silica gel g with three developments in
hexane ⁄ ethyl acetate (3 : 1, v ⁄ v). for nmr and ms analyses, they were eluted from the silica gel with chloroform ⁄ methanol (1 : 1, v ⁄ v), dried separately under nitrogen,
and shipped on dry ice.

metabolism of  xxxd2019xxx  by adrenal mitochondria
adrenals were obtained from male wistar rats aged
3 months, killed under anesthesia. the animals were housed
at the vivarium of the department of biotestings of bioorganic chemistry institute, minsk, belarus. the experi-

2898

ments were approved by the belarus university animal
care and use committee. the reactions were run as described previously [17,18]. brieﬂy, mitochondria prepared
from the adrenals were preincubated (10 min at 37 c) with
100 lm  xxxd2019xxx  (dissolved in 45% 2-hydroxypropylcyclodextrin) in buffer comprising 0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm
hepes ph 7.4, 20 mm kcl, 5 mm  xxxd2534xxx , and 0.2 mm
edta. the reactions were started by adding nadph
(0.5 mm) and isocitrate (5 mm) to the samples, and after
90 min mixtures were extracted with methylene chloride
and the organic layers combined and dried. the residues
were dissolved in methanol and subjected to lc ⁄ ms analysis as detailed below.

nmr
samples of the puriﬁed hydroxy metabolites of  xxxd2019xxx 
(the masses of the compounds were conﬁrmed by ms) were
dissolved in 40 ll of ‘100% d’ cdcl3 (cambridge isotope
laboratories, inc., andover, ma), and nmr spectra were
acquired using a varian inova-500 m nmr spectrometer
equipped with a 4 mm inverse ghx nanoprobe (varian
nmr, inc., palo alto, ca). the total volume in the nmr
rotor was 40 ll, and all spectra were acquired at a temperature of 294 k with a spinning rate of 2500 hz. proton
1d nmr, cosy and hsqc spectra were acquired and
processed with standard parameters. possible positions of
the hydroxyl groups in the metabolite were analyzed by
comparing the acquired spectra with those of parent  xxxd2019xxx .

ms
products of  xxxd2019xxx  metabolism by puriﬁed  xxxg570xxx 
were eluted from tlc plates and dissolved in ethanol, and
electron impact (ei) mass spectra were recorded with
a micromass vg autospec mass spectrometer (waters,
milford, ma) operating at 70 ev with scanning from 800
to 50 at 1 sæper decade.
the products of mitochondrial transformation (see
above) were dissolved in methanol and analyzed on an
hplc mass spectrometer (lcms-qp8000a, shimadzu,
kyoto, japan) equipped with a restec allure c18 column
(150 · 4.6 mm; 5 lm particle size, and 60 å pore size),
uv ⁄ vis photodiode array detector (spd-m10avp) and
quadrupole mass spectrometer. the lc ⁄ ms workstation
class 8000 software was used for system control and data
acquisition (shimadzu). elution was carried out at a ﬂow
rate of 0.75 mlæmin)1 at 40 c. the mobile phases consisted of 85% methanol and 0.1% acetic acid from 0 to
25 min, followed by a linear gradient to 100% methanol
and 0.1% acetic acid from 25 to 35 min, and 100%
methanol and 0.1% acetic acid from 35 to 50 min. the
mass spectrometer was operated in atmospheric pressure

chemical ionization (apci) positive ion mode and nitrogen
was used as the nebulizing gas. the ms parameters were as
follows: nebulizer gas ﬂow rate 2.5 læmin)1; probe high
voltage 4.5 kv; probe temperature 250 c; curved desolvation line heater temperature 230 c. analyses were carried
out in the scan mode from m ⁄ z 370 to 430 or in sim
mode.

cell culture experiments
hacat keratinocytes were grown in dmem with 5% fetal
bovine serum and 1% antibiotic solution as described previously [39].  xxxd2019xxx  metabolites, produced by puriﬁed
 xxxg570xxx  and isolated by tlc, were further puriﬁed by
rp-hplc through a restec allure c18 column
(150 · 4.6 mm; 5 lm particle size; 60 å pore size) following
the procedure described for lc ⁄ ms (see above). for testing biological activity,  xxxd2019xxx  and its metabolites were
dissolved in cyclodextrin, as described previously [19].

 xxxd2019xxx  metabolism by  xxxg570xxx 

f10 medium containing  xxxd2019xxx  and its hydroxy derivatives. compounds were added again after 12 h. after
another 12 h (entire incubation with compounds lasted
24 h), cells were lysed with passive lysis buffer and luciferase, and renilla luciferase signals were recorded after
sequential addition of luciferase assay reagent ii and
stop-glo reagent (promega, madison, wi) using a
td-20 ⁄ 20 luminometer (turner designs, sunnyvale, ca).
after subtraction of background, the speciﬁc signal was
divided by the renilla signal. resulting values were divided
by the mean value for controls (cells transfected with ivlluc construct and incubated without compounds).

statistical analysis
data are presented as mean ± sem (n ¼ 3–8) and analyzed with student’s t-test. each experiment was performed
independently two times.

dna synthesis
cells were seeded at 5000 per well into 96-well plates in
growth medium. after 6 h, medium was discarded and
serum-free ham’s f10 medium was added. after 12 h, this
medium was changed to 5% fetal bovine serum ham’s
f10 medium containing compounds to be tested  xxxd1891xxx )10
and 10)12 m. after 12 h, medium was discarded and
replaced with 5% fetal bovine serum ham’s medium containing test compounds and [3h]thymidine (1 lciæml)1),
and incubated for an additional 12 h. after treatment,
media were discarded, cells were detached with trypsin
and harvested on a glass ﬁber ﬁlter, and radioactivity proportional to methyl-[3h]thymidine incorporated into dna
was counted with a packard direct beta counter (packard,
meriden, ca).

reporter gene assay
the effect of  xxxd2019xxx  metabolites on the transcriptional
activity of the  xxxg1217xxx  promoter was assessed with a
reporter gene assay. cells were seeded at 20 000 per well in
24-well plates in growth medium. after 6 h, cells were
transfected using transfection reagents (sc-29528 and
sc-36868) from santa cruz biotechnology inc., santa cruz,
ca in serum-free f10 medium with ﬁreﬂy luciferase reporter gene plasmid ivl-luc containing the  xxxg1217xxx  gene
promoter region () 668 bp to + 34 bp; added at 1 lg per
well) and with phrl-tk (expresses renilla luciferase and
serves as normalization control; promega, madison, wi;
added at 1 lg per well). ivl-luc and p-luc (control without promoter, empty vector) plasmids were constructed as
described previously [18]. twelve hours after transfection,
the medium was changed to 5% fetal bovine serum ham’s
