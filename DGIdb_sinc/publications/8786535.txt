anesthetics produce subunit-selective actions on glutamate receptors.  we assessed the involvement of specific glutamate receptors in the action of anesthetics. in addition to the clinical anesthetics  xxxd1993xxx , isoflurane and halothane, we tested novel halogenated compounds, which are anesthetic or nonanesthetic in vivo, on  xxxg981xxx  (glur) subunits. these volatile compounds as well as pentobarbital and phenobarbital were tested on kainate-induced currents in xenopus oocytes expressing  xxxg952xxx ,  xxxg954xxx ,  xxxg953xxx +3 or  xxxg959xxx  subunits. the anesthetic 1-chloro-1,2,2-triflurocyclobutane (f3) weakly inhibited kainate responses in oocytes expressing  xxxg954xxx  receptors but not oocytes expressing  xxxg952xxx  or  xxxg953xxx +3 receptors. surprisingly, f3 potentiated kainate responses in oocytes expressing the kainate-selective receptor  xxxg959xxx . the nonanesthetics 2,3-chlorooctafluorobutane (f8) and 1,2-dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane (f6) did not affect  xxxg954xxx  or  xxxg959xxx  kainate responses. isoflurane weakly inhibited although  xxxd1993xxx  and halothane modestly inhibited kainate responses in oocytes expressing  xxxg952xxx ,  xxxg954xxx  or  xxxg953xxx +3 receptors. as with f3, isoflurane,  xxxd1993xxx  and halothane potentiated kainate-induced currents of  xxxg959xxx  receptors. the respective inhibitory and potentiating effects of halothane on  xxxg954xxx  and  xxxg959xxx  receptors were enhanced by increasing duration of halothane exposure. in contrast to the opposing action of volatile anesthetics, pentobarbital and phenobarbital inhibited  xxxg954xxx  and  xxxg959xxx  kainate responses and had a much greater effect on  xxxg959xxx  receptors. these results provide novel evidence that anesthetics produce selective actions on glutamate receptors, suggesting that subunit composition may determine the role of glutamate receptors in anesthesia.
