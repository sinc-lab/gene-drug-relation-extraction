2,3-diaminopropionate ammonia-lyase (dapal),
which catalyzes a, b-elimination of 2,3-diaminopropionate regardless of its stereochemistry, was puriˆed from salmonella typhimurium. we cloned the escherichia coli ygex gene encoding a putative dapal
and puriˆed the gene product to homogeneity. the protein obtained contained pyridoxal 5?-phosphate and was
composed of two identical subunits with a calculated
molecular weight of 43,327. it catalyzed the a, b-elimination of both d - and l-2,3-diaminopropionate. the
results conˆrmed that ygex encoded dapal. the enzyme acted on  xxxd5xxx , but its catalytic e‹ciency was
only 0.5% that with d-2,3-diaminopropionate. the
enzymologic properties of e. coli dapal resembled
those of salmonella dapal, except that l-serine, d and l-b-cl-alanine were inert as substrates of the enzyme from e. coli. dapal had signiˆcant sequence
similarity with the catalytic domain of  xxxd3361xxx  dehydratase, which is a member of the fold-type ii group
of  xxxd3047xxx  enzymes, together with d -serine
dehydratase and mammalian  xxxg2204xxx .
key words:

2,3-diaminopropionate; 2,3-diaminopropionate ammonia-lyase;  xxxd5xxx ; escherichia coli

2,3-diaminopropionate (dap) is a nonproteinaceous amino acid that occurs in various organisms.
l-dap is a constituent of the peptide antibiotics
viomycin 1) and edeine,2) and also occurs in free form
in the seeds of several plants.3) the amino acid is a
precursor of a neurotoxin, 2-n-oxalyl-l-2,3-diaminopropionate, in the grass pea, lathyrus sativus.4) ddap has been found in larvae of the silkworm, bombyx mori,5) in which it disappears at the late larval
and pupal stages, while  xxxd5xxx  increases.6) the
physiological roles of d-dap and  xxxd5xxx  in the
silkworm have not been clariˆed. in the mammalian
brain,7)  xxxd5xxx  serves as an endogenous ligand for
the n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor and is related to
the transcription of the gene encoding a putative
membrane protein in the rat cerebral cortex.8) there

being stage-speciˆc changes in the  xxxd5xxx  and ddap concentrations implies that these two amino
acids have some physiological functions in silkworm
larvae.
we have been studying the physiological roles of
these d-amino acids and the enzymes related to their
metabolism.9)  xxxd5xxx  is synthesized by serine
racemase in silkworm larvae,9) as well as in the mammalian brain,10) and is degraded by  xxxg602xxx .11) no enzymes catalyzing the degradation of ddap have been reported for eukaryotic cells. on the
other hand, 2,3-diaminopropionate ammonia-lyase
(dapal) ( xxxg1016xxx .15), which catalyzes a, b-elimination of d-dap to ammonia and pyruvate, has been
found in actinomycetes and bacteria. dapal puriˆed from salmonella typhimurium depends on
pyridoxal 5?-phosphate (plp) and acts on both dand l-dap.12) the amino acid sequence of the nterminal 22 amino acids and that of 20 active-site
amino acids are known for salmonella dapal
(sdapal).12) on the basis of these sequences,
stm1002 13) and the ygex genes of s. typhimurium
and e. coli k-12, respectively, may encode putative
dapal (fig. 1). in this study, we cloned the ygex
gene and puriˆed the gene product to homogeneity
from recombinant e. coli cells. we conˆrmed that
ygex encodes e. coli dapal (edapal), characterized the properties of the enzyme, and compared
them with those of sdapal.

comparison of the amino acid sequences of edapal and putative sdapal.
amino acid sequences were aligned by the clustal v program of dnastar (usa). the underlined sequences of sdapal are
those identiˆed by edman degradation.12) the asterisk indicates the lysyl residue that binds plp in sdapal.12)

cloning of the ygex gene. the dna fragment
containing the ygex gene was ampliˆed by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with e. coli genomic
dna as a template. the sense primer used for pcr
was 5?-ttccagaattcaaaaggataggat-3?,
which contained an ecori site, shown by the underline, and the antisense primer was 5?-gtact
aagcttttctcgtcgca-3?, which containing a
hindiii site. the resultant pcr products were
digested with ecori and hindiii. the plasmid
pdapal was obtained by ligation of the digested
pcr fragment into pbluescript ii sk(„) digested
with the same enzymes.
enzyme assays. the a, b-elimination reaction of ldap, d-dap, and other substrates was assayed by
the following three methods. 1) the amount of pyruvate formed during the reaction was measured spectrophotometrically with ldh and nadh. the reaction was done at 379
c in 1 ml of a reaction mixture
consisting of 200 mm potassium phosphate bušer
(ph 7.8), an appropriate concentration of d- or ldap, 5 units of ldh, 0.25 mm nadh, and an appropriate amount of edapal. the reaction was
started by addition of the enzyme and the decrease in
absorbance at 340 nm due to the consumption of
nadh was monitored. 2) the amount of pyruvate
was measured with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine
(2,4-dnp). the reaction was done in 1 ml of a reaction mixture consisting of 200 mm potassium phosphate bušer (ph 7.8), 10 mm d- or l-dap, and
edapal. the reaction was done at 379
c for 5 min
and stopped by the addition of 1 ml of 2 m hcl con-

taining 0.03z (w w
v) 2,4-dnp. the mixture was incubated at 49c for 5 min, and 2 ml of 2 m naoh was
added. absorbance at 520 nm was measured spectrophotometrically. 3) edapal was assayed by
measurement with nessler's reagent of the amount of
nh3 produced. one unit of enzyme activity is deˆned
as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation
of 1 mmol of pyruvate from d- or l-dap per minute.
protein was assayed with a bio-rad protein assay kit
with bovine  xxxg124xxx  as the standard.

puriˆcation of edapal. e. coli cells carrying
pdapal were cultured in luria-bertani broth (6.3 l)
containing ampicillin (200 mg w
ml) at 379
c for 3 h,
and then iptg was added to the culture at the ˆnal
concentration of 1 mm. the cells were cultured for
another 13 h, harvested, and washed with 0.85z
nacl. the puriˆcation was done at 49
c. washed
cells (about 50 g, wet weight) were sonicated in
200 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate bušer (ph
7.2) containing 1 mm edta, 0.01z  xxxd26xxx , 10 mm plp, 100 mm phenylmethane sulfonyl ‰uoride, and 100 mm n-tosyl-l-phenylalanyl
chloromethyl ketone, and centrifugated. the supernatant was brought to 20z saturation with ammonium sulfate. after this was stirred for 1 h, the
precipitate was removed by centrifugation at
12,000 g, ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant solution to 60z saturation. after 1 h of stirring, the suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 g, and
the pellet obtained was dissolved in 10 mm potassium
phosphate bušer (ph 7.2) containing 1 mm edta
and 0.01z  xxxd26xxx  (bušer a), and dia-

lyzed against the same bušer. after centrifugation,
the supernatant was put on a deae-sephacel
column ( xxxd1738xxx .0×30 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm
potassium phosphate bušer (ph 7.2). the column
was washed with the same bušer (500 ml), and the
enzyme was eluted with 100 mm potassium phosphate
bušer (ph 7.2). the active fractions were combined
and brought to 20z saturation with ammonium
sulfate. the enzyme solution was put on a butyltoyopearl column ( xxxd1738xxx .0×15 cm) equilibrated
with 20 mm potassium phosphate bušer (ph 7.2) at
20z saturation of ammonium sulfate. after the
column was washed with 50 ml of the same bušer,
the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 20–
15z saturated ammonium sulfate in the same bušer.
the active fractions were combined, dialyzed against
bušer a containing 100 mm kcl, and concentrated
with a centriprep 30 (millipore, usa). the enzyme
solution was put on a superose 12 column equilibrated with bušer a containing 100 mm kcl, and eluted
with the same bušer. the active fractions were combined and dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate bušer (ph 7.2) containing 1 mm edta and
0.01z  xxxd26xxx  (bušer b). the dialyzed
enzyme solution was put on a monoq column
equilibrated with bušer b. after the column was
washed with the same bušer, the enzyme was eluted
with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m kcl in bušer b. the
purity of the enzyme was measured by sds-page.

results and discussion
cloning and expression of ygex, and puriˆcation
of the gene product
to assess whether the e. coli ygex gene actually
encoded dapal, we constructed the plasmid
pdapal, an expression vector of ygex, by ligation
of the ygex gene fragment ampliˆed by pcr into the
plasmid pbluescript ii (sk„). dapal activity was
measured by the coupling assay method with ldh
(method 1). the activity of 0.73 unit w
mg was found
in the crude extract prepared from the e. coli jm109
cells harboring pdapal. in contrast, no activity
was obtained with an extract of the host cells contain-

ing an empty vector. these results suggest that the
ygex gene encoded edapal. absence of the
dapal activity in the host cells suggested little or no
expression of the ybex gene under these conditions.
edapal was puriˆed to homogeneity from the
recombinant e. coli cells in six steps. the puriˆcation
procedure is summarized in table 1. the molecular
weight of the homogeneous preparation of edapal
estimated by sds-page (43×103 ) agreed with the
value calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence (43,327).

characterization of edapal
the molecular weight of edapal was estimated
to be 78,000 on a calibrated superose 12 column,
suggesting that the enzyme was a dimer composed of
two identical subunits. the puriˆed enzyme absorbed
at about 280 and 415 nm (fig. 2). reduction of the
enzyme by dialysis with sodium borohydride caused
disappearance of the 415-nm peak and an increase in
absorbance at 330 nm, with loss of the enzyme activity. these results suggest that the enzyme was bound
with plp through a schiš base. the conserved lys77
of edapal was probably a plp-binding lysyl
residue (see figs. 1 and 4).
sdapal has maximum activity with l-dap at ph
7.8–8.0.12) the ph dependency of the reaction with ddap has not been reported. we found that the optimum ph was 8.0 with both substrates (fig. 3).
the stoichiometry of the reaction catalyzed by
edapal was studied with d- and l-dap as the substrate. the amounts of ammonia and pyruvate
formed from l-dap after 20 min of incubation with
edapal were 8.1 and 4.2 mmol, respectively. the
amounts from d-dap under the same conditions
were 6.0 and 3.6 mmol, respectively. these results indicated that 1 mole of pyruvate and 2 moles of ammonia were formed from 1 mole of either l- or d-

l-dap (b) as the substrate.
the reaction mixture was 100 m m bušer, 10 m m d- or l-dap,
and an appropriate amount of edapl. bušers used were sodium acetate (ph 5.0–5.5, closed circles), potassium phosphate
(ph 6.0–8.0, open circles), hepes (ph 7.0–8.5, closed
squares), and n-cyclohexyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid
(caps) (ph 9.0–10.5, open squares). the amount of pyruvate
formed was measured spectrophotometrically with ldh and
nadh as described in materials and methods. activity relative
to that at ph 8.0 was plotted.

a, b-elimination of l- and d-dap.
the apparent km and vmax values were estimated:

0.048 mm and 25 mmol min mg . the vmax w

values are closed to the vmax w

120 mmol min„1 mg„1 mm„1 :
l-dap,
(d-dap,
390 mmol min„1 mg„1 mm„1 ). edapal acted on dserine and catalyzed the formation of pyruvate.
however, the rate of pyruvate formation from  xxxd5xxx  was only about 0.5z that from d-dap. the following amino acids were inert as substrates: l-serine,
d-threonine,  xxxd3361xxx , d-b-cl-alanine, and l-b-clalanine. edapal and sdapal resemble each other
in subunit structure, kinetic parameters with l- and
d-dap, and ph optimum, but they dišer slightly
from each other in substrate speciˆcity: d- and l-bcl-alanine and l-serine serve as a substrate of
sdapal.12)

comparison with other plp-dependent enzymes
a blast search of protein databases showed that
edapal had some sequence similarity with  xxxd3361xxx  dehydratase (ec 4.2.1.16) of various origins
(fig. 4). plp enzymes have been classiˆed into ˆve
groups on the basis of similarities in sequence and
secondary structure.14)  xxxd3361xxx  dehydratase is in
the fold-type ii group together with d- xxxg2043xxx  15,16) and mammalian  xxxg2204xxx ,10) the
latter two enzymes acting on  xxxd5xxx . crystallographic studies have shown that e. coli biosynthetic
 xxxd3361xxx  dehydratase consists of a catalytic n-terminal domain (residue 1–320) containing plp and a
regulatory c-terminal domain (residues 321–514).17)
edapal was 20z identical in sequence to the n-ter-

minal domain of  xxxd3361xxx  dehydratase (fig. 4).
the catalytic domain of  xxxd3361xxx  dehydratase
b strucconsists of two subdomains with a mixed a w
ture. the plp-bound lys62 is between these two
subdomains.17) the plp ring is sandwiched between
phe61 and gly241. the pyridine n1 of plp is
hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of ser315, and the
3? oxygen of plp is stabilized by a hydrogen bond
donated by asn89.17) all of these residues of  xxxd3361xxx  dehydratase were conserved in edapal
(fig. 4). the two enzymes probably have some common structure at or near the plp-binding site.
a remarkable characteristic of dapal was that
the enzyme acted on both l- and d-dap nonstereospeciˆcally. the ˆrst step of the a, b-elimination reaction catalyzed by plp enzymes is transaldimination to form a substrate-plp schiš base
(external schiš base), followed by the abstraction of
a-hydrogen to form an anionic intermediate.18) at the
stage of a-hydrogen abstraction, the ca-h bond of
the external schiš base is perpendicular to the plane
of the plp ring because the rate of ca-bond cleavage
is the highest when the bond has maximal overlap
with the conjugated p-electron system of the external
schiš base.19) two reaction mechanisms, a one-base
mechanism and a two-base mechanism, are possible
for the nonstereospeciˆc a, b-elimination of dap
catalyzed by dapal. in the one-base mechanism,
the a-hydrogen of both d- and l-dap is abstracted
by the same catalytic residue. in this case, the binding
sites of the l-dap-plp schiš base should dišer
from those of the d-isomer. however, the structure
around the plp-binding site of dapal probably is
similar to that of  xxxd3361xxx  dehydratase catalyzing
the l-enantiomer reaction-speciˆc reaction. it is
di‹cult to assume the presence of a dišerent binding
site for each l- and d-dap-plp schiš base. in the
two-base mechanism, the a-hydrogens of l- and ddap are abstracted by dišerent catalytic residues,
which are opposite each other across the plane of the
external schiš base. in this case, the l- and d-dapplp schiš bases can share binding sites. such a twobase mechanism has been proposed for the alanine
racemase of bacillus stearothermophilus. the enzyme catalyzes the interconversion between l- and dalanine with the two catalytic bases, lysine 39 abstracting and adding the a-hydrogen of d-alanine,
and tyrosine 265 having the corresponding role for lalanine.20–24) abstraction of a-hydrogen is a common
step for racemization and a, b-elimination. like alanine racemase, edapal probably has two catalytic
residues, each of which abstracts the a-hydrogen of
either l- or d-dap. edapal had 19z sequence
identity to mouse  xxxg2204xxx , the ˆrst example
of an amino acid racemase belonging to the fold-type
ii group 10) (fig. 4). most of the residues interacting
with plp in  xxxd3361xxx  dehydratase were conserved
in the  xxxg2204xxx  as well as in dapal.
