abstract
the osmotic pressure of the body ﬂuids of aphids is lower than in their diet of plant phloem sap. it is hypothesised that aphids
reduce the osmotic pressure of ingested food by sucrase-mediated hydrolysis of dietary sucrose to glucose and fructose, and the
polymerisation of glucose into oligosaccharides of low osmotic pressure per hexose unit. to test this hypothesis, the impact of the aglucosidase inhibitor acarbose on the sugar relations and osmoregulation of aphids was explored. acarbose inhibited sucrase
activity in gut homogenates and the production of monosaccharides and oligosaccharides in the honeydew of live aphids. acarbose
caused an increase in the haemolymph osmotic pressure for aphids reared on a diet (containing 0.75 m sucrose) hyperosmotic to the
haemolymph and not on the isoosmotic diet containing 0.2 m sucrose. it did not affect aphid feeding rate over 2 days, except at high
concentrations on 0.75 m sucrose diet, and this may have been a secondary consequence of osmotic dysfunction. acarbose-treated
aphids died prematurely. with 5 mm dietary acarbose, mean survivorship on 0.2 m sucrose diet was 4.2 days, not signiﬁcantly
different from starved aphids, indicating that, although these aphids fed, they were deprived of utilisable carbon; and on 0.75 m
sucrose diet, mean survivorship was just 2.8 days, probably as a consequence of osmotic failure. it is concluded that the aphid gut
sucrase activity is essential for osmoregulation of aphids ingesting food hyperosmotic to their body ﬂuids.

1. introduction
for phloem-feeding insects, including aphids, whiteﬂy
and psyllids, the high sugar content (0.2 to 41 m) of
plant phloem sap represents both an abundant source of
carbon and an osmotic challenge. the total solute
concentration and osmotic pressure of phloem sap is
variable and usually in the range 2–45 mpa, up to ﬁvefold higher than in the insect body ﬂuids, with osmotic
pressure generally not more than 1 mpa (downing,
1978; wilkinson et al., 1997; ponder et al., 2000; fisher,

2000). as a consequence, dehydration, through the loss
of water from body ﬂuids to the gut, is a major
physiological threat for phloem-feeding insects.
the gut plays a central role in osmoregulation of
phloem sap feeding insects. most research has addressed
the hypothesis that the osmotic pressure of food
ingested into the gut is reduced by synthesis of
oligosaccharides with a higher molecular weight than
the ingested sugars, thereby reducing the osmotic
pressure per unit weight of sugar (douglas, 2003). in
support of this proposal, the osmotic pressure of the
honeydew (egesta) and haemolymph of aphids are
closely similar, and the oligosaccharide content of
honeydew increases with dietary sucrose concentration
and osmotic pressure (downing, 1978; fisher et al.,
1984; wilkinson et al., 1997). the source of the
honeydew oligosaccharides in aphids has been

established primarily from studies on the gut carbohydrase complement of aphids and the fate of radiolabelled sucrose ingested by aphids. it has been
established, ﬁrst, that ingested sucrose is hydrolysed by
an a-glucosidase, sucrase, to its constituent monosaccharides, glucose and fructose, in the posterior midgut
(ashford et al., 2000; cristofoletti et al., 2003); second,
that some of the hexose (predominantly fructose) is
assimilated across the gut wall (ashford et al., 2000);
and, ﬁnally, that the remainder (mostly glucose) is
transformed via gut transglucosidase activity into
oligosaccharides egested in the honeydew (walters and
mullin, 1988; rhodes et al., 1997; ashford et al., 2000).
the synthesis of oligosaccharides by transglucosidation
of hexoses reduces the osmotic pressure per hexose unit.
the sucrase and transglucosidase activity in the aphid
gut may be mediated by a single enzyme (ashford et al.,
2000), and a candidate sucrase protein with a-glucosidase activity has been puriﬁed from acyrthosiphon pisum
guts and localised by immunocytochemistry to the
posterior midgut, the principal site of sucrase activity
(cristofoletti et al., 2003).
one prediction arising from current understanding of
sugar transformations in the aphid gut is that inhibition
of aphid gut sucrase would result in osmoregulatory
dysfunction, detected as increased haemolymph osmotic
pressure and reduced oligosaccharide content of the
honeydew. the purpose of this study was to test this
prediction by, ﬁrst, identifying an effective inhibitor of
aphid sucrase, and, second, quantifying the impact of
this inhibitor on aphid performance, the osmotic
pressure of aphid haemolymph and the sugar composition of honeydew.

2. materials and methods
2.1. the insects
the pea aphid a. pisum clone uy2 was derived from
a single alate female collected in 1993 from pisum
sativum cv. onward at the university of york campus
and maintained on vicia faba cv. the sutton in a
controlled environment chamber with a light regime of
16 h l:8 h d at 100 mmol m2 s1 par. the aphids used
to study the effects of inhibitors on gut enzyme activities
were reared at 16 1c because the large size of these
aphids aided gut dissections. all other experiments were
conducted at 20 1c, and followed a standard procedure,
as follows. two-day-old larvae were reared on a
chemically deﬁned diet of formulation a (prosser and
douglas, 1992) containing 0.5 m sucrose and 0.15 m
amino acids to day 7, when they were transferred to test
diets containing 0.2 m sucrose (osmotic pressure
1.1 mpa, comparable to that of aphid haemolymph) or
0.75 m sucrose (osmotic pressure 2.6 mpa) (osmotic

data from wilkinson et al. (1997)), and the sucrase
inhibitor, acarbose, at a concentration of 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1 or
5 mm.
2.2. sucrase assay of gut preparations
alimentary tracts from oesophagus to anus were
dissected from plant-reared adult apterous aphids with
the aid of ﬁne needles and disrupted in ice-cold 0.9%
nacl using a hand-held plastic homogeniser. the
homogenates were stored at 20 1c prior to use.
disaccharidase activity of gut homogenates was
assayed as described previously for sucrase (ashford et
al., 2000), with one unit of activity deﬁned as the
amount of enzyme that releases 1 mmol glucose from
sucrose per minute at 37 1c. for inhibition assays, a
constant amount of homogenate containing 0.65 mu
sucrase was assayed in the presence of 500 pm to 5 mm
inhibitor. the compounds tested were two known aglucosidase inhibitors, acarbose and  xxxd1955xxx 
and, as a control, deoxygalactonojirimycin, an inhibitor
of a-galactosidase. for acarbose inhibition of sucrase,
 xxxg1401xxx  and trehalase activities, initial enzyme activities
were, respectively, 0.054, 0.024 and 0.071 u mg1
protein.
2.3. the honeydew and haemolymph of feeding aphids
the radiolabelled inulin technique (wright et al.,
1985) was used to quantify aphid feeding rate. 3h-inulin
(calbiochem) at 8 mci ml1 was administered to 7-dayold aphids orally via chemically deﬁned diets, positioned
above 25 mm gf/c ﬁlters (whatman), on which the
honeydew droplets were collected. to score the radioactivity, each ﬁlter was placed in a scintillation vial
containing 4 ml ultima goldtm xr scintillation ﬂuid
(packard bioscience b.v., gröningen, the netherlands), and radioactivity was determined by scintillation
counting in a packard tri-carb liquid scintillation
analyzer using a pre-set 3h window. feeding rate was
quantiﬁed by comparison with the speciﬁc activity of the
radiolabelled diet, with aphids feeding from replicate
non-radioactive sachets included as controls. diet
sachets containing only water and radiolabelled inulin
were included as a further control. aphid survival on the
test diets was scored daily and feeding was assessed over
2 days.
for the analysis of honeydew composition, radiolabelled [u-14c]-sucrose (amersham, uk) was checked
for purity by thin layer chromatography and was
included in the diets at 8 mci ml1. aphids feeding from
replicate non-radioactive sachets were included as
controls. honeydew collected over the following
24–48 h was dissolved in sterile de-ionised water and
stored at 20 1c prior to analysis.

aphid haemolymph was collected from aphids that
had been feeding for 48 h from the test diets described
above. aphids were submerged in water-saturated
parafﬁn oil and a middle leg was removed from the
aphid using forceps. exuding haemolymph was collected
under the oil using silanised microcapillaries and
samples were stored in the capillaries at 20 1c until
analysis. the osmotic pressure of 0.05–0.5 nl samples of
aphid haemolymph was determined by freezing-point
depression (malone and tomos, 1992) calibrated
against 0–0.6 m nacl standards. brieﬂy, haemolymph
samples were expelled onto a glass cover slip covered
with a drop of water-saturated parafﬁn oil. the
temperature of the glass was reduced to 35 1c to
freeze the samples and then raised, ﬁrst to 2 1c and
then gradually while observing the frozen samples
through a binocular microscope. the temperature at
which each sample melted was recorded.
2.4. chemical analyses
honeydew sugars were separated by normal phase
hplc as described by ashford et al. (2000). [u-14c]glucose (amersham, uk), [u-14c]-sucrose and the
products of [u-14c]-sucrose hydrolysed at 70 1c in the
presence of 0.5 m hcl for 1 h were used as standards.
during hplc, 0.38 ml fractions of the column efﬂuent
were collected in a 96 well lumaplate (packard) and,
following drying under vacuum, the radioactivity in
each fraction was determined by scintillation counting
on a packard topcount nxt microplate scintillation
counter using a preset 14c window.

incorporating the explanatory variable, then including
the explanatory variable. the change in deviance (which
approximates w2) when the explanatory variable was
added to the model was used to assess the signiﬁcance of
the effect of acarbose concentration on survival. the
percentage change in the deviance provides a measure of
the explanatory power of the model. aphid survival
beyond the 10-day experimental period was not
quantiﬁed and survival values greater than 10 days were
not included in the survivorship analysis.

3.1. impact of a-glycosidase inhibitors on gut sucrase
activity in vitro
homogenates of aphid guts hydrolysed sucrose,
maltose and trehalose, as reported previously (ashford
et al., 2000). the sucrase activity was inhibited by two of
the three inhibitor compounds tested (fig. 1a). acarbose was the most potent inhibitor, with ic50 of
5.9  108 m. the ic50 of  xxxd1955xxx  was

2.5. statistical analyses
parametric statistical tests were applied to datasets
conﬁrmed to be normally distributed (ryan-joiner onesample test) with homogeneous variances (bartlett’s
test), following logarithmic or arcsin-square root transformation where indicated. the impact of diet composition on aphid feeding rate, honeydew composition and
haemolymph osmotic pressure was tested using anova with post hoc analysis by tukey’s pairwise
comparison or, where non-parametric analyses were
required, using kruskal–wallis and mann–whitney
tests. the ic50 values for inhibition of disaccharidase
activity in vitro were obtained from four-parameter
logistic curve ﬁts to the data using spss sigmaplot
v8.02 (novell inc., us). aphid survivorship analysis was
conducted with generalised linear modelling available in
the glim statistical package (crawley, 1993). the
impact of diet composition was explored using a weibull
model, which assumes an age-dependent mortality risk
and can incorporate a linear combination of explanatory variables (in this case, dietary acarbose concentration). the weibull model was ﬁtted ﬁrstly without

millimolar concentrations ðic 50 ¼ 7:11  102 mþ. between 50% and 100% inhibition of sucrase was achieved
by acarbose in the nano-to-micro-molar range of
concentrations. acarbose was also effective at inhibiting
the gut  xxxg1401xxx  ðic 50 ¼ 4:7  108 mþ, but not the
trehalase (fig. 1b).
3.2. impact of dietary acarbose on aphid survival and
feeding
the 7-day-old aphids settled and initially fed on all
diets containing sucrose, as indicated by honeydew
production. aphid feeding on the water control diet was
extremely low and all the aphids died within 7 days
(table 1). on the acarbose-free diets, 7 and 8 of the 9
test aphids survived the 10-day experimental period on
the diets containing 0.2 and 0.75 m sucrose. inclusion of
acarbose in the diet increased aphid mortality in a
concentration-dependent manner (table 1), from no
discernible impact of 0.1 mm acarbose (with 8 and 9 of
the 9 aphids surviving on 0.2 and 0.75 m sucrose diets,
respectively) to total mortality on diets with 5 mm
acarbose within 4 days on the 0.75 m sucrose diet and
6 days on the 0.2 m sucrose diet. the variation in mean
lifespan of aphids on diets containing water and 0.5 to
5 mm acarbose was statistically signiﬁcant for aphids on
both sucrose concentrations (table 1).
consistent with previous studies (reviewed in douglas, 2003), the aphids on the acarbose-free diets
displayed a compensatory feeding response to low
sucrose, ingesting 38% more diet on the 0.2 m sucrose
diet than on the 0.75 m diet over the ﬁrst 2 days after
transfer to the test diets (table 1). aphid feeding rate
was signiﬁcantly affected by acarbose on the 0.75 m
sucrose diet, but not on the 0.2 m sucrose diet
(table 1), and tukey’s post hoc analysis of the data
for 0.75 m sucrose diet indicated that feeding rate was

signiﬁcantly depressed by 1 and 5 mm acarbose on the
0.75 m sucrose diet compared to diets containing
0–0.5 mm acarbose.
3.3. impact of dietary acarbose on honeydew composition
radioactivity from dietary [u-14c]-sucrose was recovered in the aphid honeydew, speciﬁcally in the
monosaccharides glucose and fructose, the disaccharide
and oligosaccharide fractions, and an unknown peak
that eluted before fructose in the hplc analysis.
consistent with previous studies (wilkinson et al.,
1997; ashford et al., 2000), aphids on acarbose-free diet
containing 0.2 m sucrose produced honeydew composed
mainly of monosaccharides, while oligosaccharides
accounted for 80–85% of radiolabelled sugars in the
honeydew of aphids feeding on 0.75 m sucrose (fig. 2).
the sugar composition of honeydew was altered
dramatically by dietary acarbose (fig. 2). at both
dietary sucrose concentrations, the honeydew of acarbose-treated aphids contained elevated amounts of
disaccharides (anova of arcsin-square root transformed data for 0.2 m sucrose diet: f 4;13 ¼ 4:15,
po0.05; kruskal–wallis analysis of %radioactivity data
for 0.75 m sucrose diet: h 4 ¼ 8:43, po0.1), at the
expense of monosaccharides in the 0.2 m sucrose diet
(kruskal–wallis analysis of %radioactivity data:
h 4 ¼ 8:32, po0.1), and of oligosaccharides in the
0.75 m sucrose diet (kruskal–wallis analysis of %radioactivity data: h 4 ¼ 7:94, po0.1). in addition, a small
but non-signiﬁcant increase in oligosaccharide production was noted at intermediate acarbose concentrations
on the 0.2 m sucrose diet (fig. 2).
3.4. impact of dietary acarbose on the osmotic pressure
of aphid haemolymph
aphid haemolymph could be obtained readily for
osmotic pressure determinations from all aphids apart

published estimates (wilkinson et al., 1997). the
osmotic pressure of the haemolymph varied signiﬁcantly
with acarbose concentration for aphids on the 0.75 m
sucrose diet (anova of ln-transformed data:
f 3;28 ¼ 6:85, po0.001) but not on the 0.2 m sucrose
diet (anova of ln-transformed data: f 4;32 ¼ 1:32,
p40.1). posthoc analysis of the dataset for the aphids
on 0.75 m sucrose revealed that the osmotic pressure
was signiﬁcantly elevated on diets containing 0.5–1 mm
acarbose relative to diets with no acarbose or 0.1 mm
acarbose.

from those on 0.75 m sucrose with 5 mm acarbose; these
aphids appeared ‘shrivelled’ and just 2 of 10 aphids
yielded sufﬁcient haemolymph for analysis. these two
values are included in fig. 3, but they are excluded from
the statistical analysis.
the osmotic pressure of the haemolymph of aphids
feeding on acarbose-free diets for 2 days did not differ
signiﬁcantly between aphids on the 0.2 and 0.75 m
sucrose diets (2-sample t-test: t12 ¼ 1:27, p40.1) and the
combined mean value, 1.07 mpa, was comparable to

the a-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose was used to
investigate the signiﬁcance of gut sucrase to the sugar
relations and osmoregulation of aphids because it was a
particularly potent inhibitor of the aphid gut sucrase
activity in vitro (fig. 1a). it was also effective in vivo, as
indicated by high recovery of disaccharide in the
honeydew of aphids reared on 5 mm acarbose (fig. 2).
the impact of acarbose on the physiology of live aphids
was interpreted in relation to sucrase activity because
sucrose is the sole sugar ingested by aphids from
chemically deﬁned diets and the dominant sugar in the
phloem sap of plants utilised by pea aphids. although
acarbose is also active against  xxxg1401xxx  activity in the
gut (fig. 1b), the physiological signiﬁcance of this result
is uncertain. maltose is not a dietary sugar and the
 xxxg1401xxx  and sucrase activities in gut homogenates
(ashford et al., 2000) are probably mediated by the
same enzyme, informally known as sucrase (cristofoletti
et al., 2003).
the aphid gut sucrase contributes to two physiological processes: acquisition of dietary carbon and osmoregulation. for aphids on the 0.75 m sucrose diet, which
is hyperosmotic to aphid haemolymph, both processes
are predicted to be important; but for aphids on 0.2 m
sucrose diet, isoosmotic with aphid haemolymph, the
osmoregulatory signiﬁcance of the gut sucrase is trivial.
this expectation is conﬁrmed by two differences in the
response to acarbose of aphids on the 0.75 and 0.2 m
sucrose diets. first, the osmotic pressure of aphid
haemolymph was signiﬁcantly elevated in acarbosetreated aphids on the 0.75 m sucrose diet, indicative of
osmoregulatory failure, but not on the 0.2 m sucrose
diet (fig. 3). second, acarbose killed the aphids more
rapidly on the 0.75 m diet than the 0.2 m diet (table 1).
for example, on the diets with 5 mm acarbose, the mean
survivorship of aphids on 0.2 m diet was comparable to
that of starved aphids (i.e. aphids on water diet)
presumably due to lack of monosaccharide substrate
for respiration, while the aphids on 0.75 m diet died in
less than half the time of starved aphids. this is despite
the fact that pea aphids on acarbose-free diets tend to

perform better on diets with 0.75 m sucrose than
with 0.2 m sucrose (simpson et al., 1995). the osmoregulatory failure of acarbose-treated aphids on 0.75 m
diet can be attributed to the inhibition of sucrasemediated generation of monosaccharide substrate for
oligosaccharide synthesis. in support of this perspective,
the aphids on acarbose-free diets produce appreciable
amounts of oligosaccharides only on the 0.75 m diet,
and not the 0.2 m diet, as described previously
(wilkinson et al., 1997; ashford et al., 2000), and
the progressive reduction in honeydew oligosaccharide
content with increasing acarbose concentrations in
the range 0.5–5 mm on the 0.75 m diet is correlated
with the increasing osmotic pressure of aphid haemolymph.
a further difference between the responses of aphids
on the two diets was their feeding rates, signiﬁcantly
depressed by acarbose only on the 0.75 m diet (table 1).
the non-signiﬁcant impact of acarbose on feeding rates
from the 0.2 m diet provides some reassurance that
acarbose, at the concentrations tested, did not have nonspeciﬁc deleterious effects on the aphids. it also suggests
that feeding rate is dictated principally by the concentration of dietary sucrose and not by post-ingestive
effects, such as metabolic demand for carbon. even on
the diet with 5 mm acarbose, which provided little
assimilable sugar (as indicated by the sucrose-dominated
honeydew and similar survivorship to starved aphids),
the aphids fed no faster than on the acarbose-free
diet. one implication is that the depressed feeding rates
on 0.75 m diet supplemented with 1–5 mm acarbose
(table 1) may be caused by non-speciﬁc deleterious
consequences of osmoregulatory failure.
it is very likely that a gut sucrase is fundamental to
the carbon nutrition and osmoregulation of all phloemfeeding insects, including the whiteﬂy, scale insects,
planthoppers and leafhoppers, as well as the aphids. for
example, the honeydew of whiteﬂy feeding on high
dietary sucrose contains elevated levels of the disaccharide trehalulose (salvucci et al., 1997), and studies with
the a-glucosidase inhibitor bromoconduritol demonstrate the synthesis of trehalulose from excess dietary
sucrose (salvucci, 2000). the applied potential is
considerable. phloem feeding insects are important
agricultural pests, through both direct damage to crops
and plant virus transmission, and instances of resistance
to conventional insecticides are increasing. sucrase is a
potential target for novel strategies to aphid pest
control. through the combined impacts on both
osmoregulation and nutrition, aphids lacking a functional sucrase are killed within a few days. it is entirely
possible that the osmoregulatory role of gut sugartransforming enzymes is a common feature of phloemfeeding insects (e.g. isaacs et al., 1998; byrne et al.,
2003), enhancing the scope of the sucrase as a target in
pest management.
