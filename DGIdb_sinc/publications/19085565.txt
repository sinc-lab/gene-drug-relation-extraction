2 american guidelines, unlike european guidelines, support the use of antihistamines as a
first line of treatment for some causes of chronic cough. transient receptor potential  xxxd428xxx -1
(trpv1) is an ion channel activated by the tussive agents capsaicin,  xxxd3101xxx , and protons. it is predominantly expressed by c-fiber and some adelta-fiber sensory neurons and is thought
to be a cough receptor. by measuring increases in intracellular calcium as an indicator of trpv1
activation, the authors sought to determine whether antihistamines could antagonise trpv1 permanently expressed in hek and pro5 cells and trpv1 endogenously expressed in rat dorsal root
ganglia neurons. in human trpv1–expressing hek cells (htrpv1-hek), diphenhydramine and
fexofenadine failed to inhibit capsaicin-triggered calcium responses. however, both  xxxd1855xxx  and chlorpheniramine significantly inhibited capsaicin-evoked responses in htrpv1-hek.
 xxxd1855xxx  also inhibited activation of rat trpv1 expressed in hek and pro5 cells,
without interfering with trpa1 and  xxxg747xxx  ( xxxg747xxx   xxxg1598xxx  ) activation. finally,
in rat dorsal root ganglia neuron preparations,  xxxd1855xxx  dose-dependently inhibited
capsaicin-evoked calcium responses. thus, the inhibition of trpv1 activation by  xxxd1855xxx  may provide one potential mechanism whereby this antihistamine exerts its therapeutic effect
in chronic cough.

transient receptor potential  xxxd428xxx -1 (trpv1) [1] is a member of the
transient receptor potential (trp) ion channel family predominantly expressed in a subset of small-to medium-diameter sensory neurons. trpv1,
like many other trp channels, is activated by noxious stimuli, such as temperatures above 43◦ c, and the irritant agents capsaicin,  xxxd3101xxx , and
protons [1–3]. trpv1 can also be activated by some lipoxygenase products,
including 12- and 15-(s)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids [3]. in the lung,
the archetypal trpv1 agonist capsaicin has been used for over 20 years to
stimulate the cough reflex [4]. in man, inhalation of capsaicin,  xxxd3101xxx , and protons produces a potent dose-related tussive response [5]
and unsurprisingly trpv1 has been suggested as a putative cough receptor [6]. as well as activation by vanilloids and other irritants, trpv1 can
be sensitized by  xxxg747xxx  ( xxxg747xxx   xxxg1598xxx  ) activation, resulting
in a heightened cough response [7]. in the pharmacotherapy of cough,
american guidelines recommend the use of first-generation antihistamines
based on clinical studies using  xxxd1855xxx  [8]. in contrast,
european guidelines contain no such recommendation [9]. however,
 xxxd1855xxx  never received a product licence in many parts of
europe. we hypothesized that the antitussive properties of  xxxd1855xxx  observed in american clinical trials were due not only to its ability to block the histamine receptor, but also to its capability to antagonise
trpv1.
materials and methods
materials
penicillin/streptomycin, fetal calf serum (fcs), dulbecco’s modified
eagle medium (dmem), minimum essentia media (mem), sodium pyruvate, fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester,  xxxd2191xxx  ( xxxg418xxx ), pcdna3, and lipofectamine were bought from invitrogen, paisley, uk. the  xxxg747xxx   xxxg1598xxx  -activating
peptide sligkv-nh2 was supplied by peptides international, louisville,
kentucky. adult sprague-dawley rats were purchased from morini, italy. all
other reagents were purchased from sigma-aldrich unless stated otherwise.
cloning and expression of rtrpv1, htrpv1, and htrpa1
htrpv1-hek and rtrpv1-hek cells used in this study have been described previously [10]. the open reading frame of human trpa1 was
cloned from cultured human lung fibroblasts. this cdna was ligated into
pcdna3 (invitrogen), sequenced (mwg-biotech, ebersberg, germany),
and compared to the published htrpa1 sequence (accession number
y10601). hek293 cells were transfected with the htrpa1 construct using the lipofectamine method according to the manufacturers protocol

(gibco). cells were cultured in  xxxd2191xxx -containing medium (dmem containing 10% fcs, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 u ml−1 penicillin, 100 µg
ml−1 streptomycin, 250 ng ml−1  xxxd164xxx , and 0.6 mg ml−1  xxxd2191xxx ) and a hek cell line permanently expressing htrpa1 was produced
using the method described previously [10]. cells expressing htrpa1 were
identified by testing for cinnamaldehyde responsiveness by measuring increases in intracellular calcium (see measurement of intracellular calcium
in transfected cell lines).
a pro5 cell line permanently expressing rtrpv1 was also generated
again using the lipofectamine method of transfection according to the
manufacturers protocol (gibco). to create a permanently expressing cell
line, rtrpv1 transfected pro5 cells were subcloned in  xxxd2191xxx  (0.6 mg
ml−1 )–containing medium (alpha minimum essential media (mem) containing 10% fcs, 100 u ml−1 penicillin, 100 µg ml−1 streptomycin, and 250
ng ml−1  xxxd164xxx ) using the method described previously [10].

measurement of intracellular calcium in transfected cell lines
calcium signaling was performed using methods based on those by
compton and colleagues [11]. cells were grown to 90% confluence in 75cm2 flasks (approximately 9 × 106 cells; bd falcon) before harvesting with
phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) (without calcium or magnesium). cells
were incubated in 1 ml of normal culture medium containing 0.25 mm
 xxxd3256xxx  and 25 µg of fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester (fluo-3 am)
at room temperature for 25 minutes with gentle shaking. the cells were
then washed by centrifugation and resuspended in calcium assay buffer
(cab) (150 mm  xxxd3213xxx , 250 µm  xxxd3256xxx , 3 mm  xxxd2988xxx , 10 mm glucose, 20 mm hepes, and 1.5 mm calcium chloride [cacl2 6h2 o], ph 7.4). increases in intracellular calcium levels were
measured at room temperature using a fluorospectrometer (photon technology international) with an excitation wavelength of 480 nm and emission measured at 530 nm. increasing concentrations of the test agonist
was added to separate cell containing cuvettes in half-log increments and
concentration-effect curves were constructed by expressing the increase in
fluorescence measured at 530 nm as a percentage of the maximum fluorescence signal after the addition of 6 µm calcium ionophore (a23187).
for inhibition of capsaicin responses, cells were incubated in cab containing either 100 µm or 1 mm antihistamine for 4 minutes before the addition of capsaicin or  xxxd3101xxx . the effect of  xxxd1855xxx 
maleate on  xxxg747xxx   xxxg1598xxx  activation by the  xxxg747xxx   xxxg1598xxx  activating peptide, sligkv-nh2
(50 µm), was measured using hek293 cells, which endogenously express
 xxxg747xxx   xxxg1598xxx  [12]. the effect of  xxxd1855xxx  on cinnamaldehyde-evoked

cultured rat dorsal root ganglia neurons
adult sprague-dawley rats were terminally anaesthetized and decapitated. dorsal root ganglia (drg) were removed and rapidly placed in collagenase (2 mg ml−1 dissolved in cold hanks’ buffered salt solution [hbss])
and trypsin (1 mg ml−1 dissolved in cold hbss) for 35 minutes at 37◦ c.
after the enzymatic treatment, ganglia were rinsed 3 times with hbss and
then placed in 2 ml of cold dmem. single cells dissociated from ganglia underwent several passages through a series of syringe needles (23 g down to
25 g). finally, the complex of medium and ganglia cells were sieved through
a 40-µm filter to remove debris and topped up with dmem medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs; heat inactivated), 2 mm iglutamine, 100 u ml−1 penicillin, and 100 µg ml−1 streptomycin and centrifuged (200 × g for 5 minutes). the final cell pellet was resuspended in
dmem medium supplemented with 100 ng ml−1 mouse neural growth factor (ngf)-7s. cells were plated on poly-l-lysine (8.3 µm)– and laminin (5
µm)–coated 25-mm glass cover slips and kept for 2 days at 37◦ c in a humidified incubator gassed with 5% co2 and air.
measurement of changes in intracellular calcium in drg
drg neurons were loaded with fura-2-am-ester (3 µm) in ca2+ buffer
solution of the following composition (mm): calcium chloride 1.4;  xxxd2988xxx  5.4;  xxxd2534xxx  0.4;  xxxd3213xxx  135; d-glucose
5; hepes 10, with bovine  xxxg124xxx  0.1%, at ph 7.4, for 35 minutes
at 37o c, washed twice with the ca2+ buffer solution, and transferred to a
chamber on the stage of nikon eclipse te300 microscope. the dye was excited at 340 and 380 nm to indicate relative intracellular calcium changes
by the f340 /f380 ratio recorded with a dynamic image analysis system (laboratory automation 2.0; rcs, florence, italy). stimuli or their respective
vehicles were directly added to the chamber. cells were pretreated with
 xxxd1855xxx  maleate (30 to 300 µm) or its vehicle (phosphate
buffer solution) 10 minutes prior to the challenge with capsaicin (0.1 µm).
at the end of each experiment,  xxxd2379xxx  (5 µm) was added to the chamber. variation in intracellular calcium was expressed as percentage of the
maximum calcium mobilization induced by  xxxd2379xxx .
data analysis
all data are expressed at the mean ± sem. ec50 values were calculated
from the concentration-effect curves fitted using the hill equation (using

 xxxd1855xxx  and chlorpheniramine inhibit
capsaicin-induced calcium mobilization in htrpv1-hek cells
capsaicin produced a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular calcium levels in htrpv1-hek cells, with an ec50 value of 3.9 nm (95%
ci 2.2 to 6.8 nm) (figure 1b). in untransfected cells, capsaicin was without
effect (data not shown). the minimal effective concentration of capsaicin
was 300 pm and a maximal calcium mobilization was achieved at 300 nm
(figure 1b). the effect of diverse h1 antagonists were tested against 10
nm capsaicin, a submaximal concentration that produced 85% of the maximal calcium mobilization induced by the ionophore a23187 (figure 1a).
following pretreatement with  xxxd1855xxx  maleate, chlorpheniramine, dipheniramine hcl, or fexofenadine (all at 100 µm), only
 xxxd1855xxx  maleatae and chlorpheniramine exhibited a significant reduction in capsaicin-evoked maximal responses (31% and 43% of
a23187, respectively).
the effect of different concentrations of  xxxd1855xxx  maleate
on the capsaicin concentration-effect curve in htrpv1-hek was then investigated (figure 1b). preincubation with  xxxd1855xxx  maleate
(100 µm or 1 mm) prior to the capsaicin challenge caused a significant reduction in the maximum obtainable response evoked by capsaicin in addition to a slight rightward shift. following pretreatment with
100 µm  xxxd1855xxx  maleate, htrpv1-hek cells responded to
capsaicin from 300 pm, reaching a maximum after 100 nm. the minimal effective capsaicin concentration following pretreatment with 1 mm
 xxxd1855xxx  maleate shifted to 3 nm, reaching a maximum at 100
nm.  xxxd1855xxx  maleate (100 µm and 1 mm) caused a 2.1- and
1.9-fold (8.3 nm [95% ci 3.3 to 20.5 nm] and 7.5 nm [95% ci 0.14 to
410 nm]) increase in the ec50 for capsaicin in htrpv1-hek, respectively
(figure 1b).

(figure 2b and c, respectively). capsaicin induced an increase in intracellular calcium from as low as 10 nm, reaching maximal response at 30 µm, with
an ec50 value of 314 nm (95% ci 124 to 795 nm) (figure 2b).  xxxd3101xxx  induced an increase in intracellular calcium from as low as 30 pm,
reaching maximal response at 3 nm, with an ec50 value of 102 pm (95% ci
17.9 to 581 pm) (figure 2c). similar to htrpv1-hek cells, preincubation
of rtrpv1-hek with  xxxd1855xxx  maleate (100 µm) significantly
reduced the maximal response by both capsaicin and  xxxd3101xxx  in addition to right-shifting the concentration-effect curves, causing a 2.4- and
25.5-fold increase in ec50 values, respectively (762 nm [95% ci 32.5 nm
to 17.9 µm] and 2.6 nm [95% ci 0.32 to 21.5 nm], respectively). following pretreatment with 100 µm  xxxd1855xxx  maleate, rtrpv1-hek
cells responded to capsaicin from 30 nm, reaching a maximum after 10 µm,
and a response to capsaicin was detectable from 300 nm, reaching a maximum by 3 µm, following pretreatment with 1 mm  xxxd1855xxx 
maleate.  xxxd3101xxx -evoked a response in rtrpv1-hek cells treated
with 100 µm  xxxd1855xxx  maleate from 10 nm, reaching a maximum by 100 nm. pretreatment with 1 mm  xxxd1855xxx  maleate,
however, severely reduced the  xxxd3101xxx -evoked responses, with minimal responses observable between 100 nm and 10 µm. to ensure the observed effect of  xxxd1855xxx  was not cell specific, rtrpv1-pro5
cells were also tested (figure 2d). rat-trpv1-pro5 also responded to capsaicin in a concentration-dependent manner from as low as 3 nm, reaching
a maximum by 300 nm, with an ec50 of 20 nm (95% ci 10.8 to 37.1 nm)
(figure 2d). following incubation with  xxxd1855xxx  (100 µm),
the rtrpv1-pro5 capsaicin concentration-effect curve showed a significant
reduction in maximal response, starting  xxxd1891xxx  nm and reaching a plateau
at 300 nm, with little change in ec50 (14 nm [95% ci 6.8 to 29.3 nm])
compared to untreated cells.
 xxxd1855xxx  inhibits trpv1 expressed in rat drg
having determined that  xxxd1855xxx  maleate effectively
inhibited rtrpv1-hek, we next tested whether  xxxd1855xxx 
maleate would inhibit trpv1 endogenously expressed in rat drg. as expected, capsaicin (0.1 µm) induced a significant calcium signal in drg.
 xxxd1855xxx  alone has no observable effect except at 300 µm,
which caused a slight but significant increase in intracellular calcium levels. this increase was allowed to return to baseline before addition of capsaicin. pretreatment of drg neurons with  xxxd1855xxx  maleate
(10 minutes) dose dependently inhibited capsaicin (0.1 µm)–evoked responses, reaching significance at 300 µm  xxxd1855xxx  (figure 3a
and b). it is worth a mention that the percentage of capsaicin-responsive
neurons in all the vehicle- and dexbromepheniramine (30, 100, and

discussion
antihistamines are frequently used to treat cough in the united states;
however in europe, the use of antihistamines is not recommended in the
management of cough. we hypothesized that this difference in clinical practice may be due to the different antihistamines available in the united states
and europe. using pharmacological methods we provide evidence to suggest that  xxxd1855xxx  maleate, an antihistamine widely used in the
united states but not in the europe, may treat cough through the inhibition
of trpv1, a putative cough receptor [6, 13].

we initially tested the ability of 4 antihistamines,  xxxd1855xxx 
maleate, chlorpheniramine, dipheniramine hcl, and fexofenadine, to inhibit trpv1 activation (calcium signaling) in hek cells permanently expressing htrpv1. of the antihistamines tested, only  xxxd1855xxx 
and chlorpheniramine caused a significant reduction in the capsaicinevoked response in htrpv1-hek cells. because  xxxd1855xxx  is
widely used in the united states to treat cough, we focused on this antihistamine. we found that the effect of  xxxd1855xxx  was not
cell or species specific because it was able to inhibit rtrpv1 permanently expressed in hek cells and pro5 cells. further, we found that the
effect of  xxxd1855xxx  was selective for trpv1 because it had
negligible effect on  xxxg747xxx   xxxg1598xxx  and trpa1 activation. finally, we showed that
 xxxd1855xxx  could inhibit capsaicin-evoked responses in drg.
thus,  xxxd1855xxx  inhibits trpv1.
interestingly, chlorpheniramine also produced a significant inhibition
of capsaicin-evoked increase in intracellular calcium. chlorpheniramine has
not been formally studied as an antitussive in the modern era and future investigations as to its clinical utility are warranted. thus two closely related
alyklamine antihistamine inhibit trpv1 responses but diphenylhydramine,
which has a similar global structure, with the alkylamine function slightly
further from the aromatic rings and lacking the pyridyl group, has no inhibitory activity. the lack of activity of structurally unrelated potent secondgeneration antihistamine fexofenadine confirmed that the histaminergic
pathway was not involved.
the prominent place given to  xxxd1855xxx  in the therapeutic guidelines on cough speaks for its efficacy in vivo and this observation led us to investigate the effect of  xxxd1855xxx  in vitro on
trpv1. although  xxxd1855xxx  inhibited trpv1 activation, the
concentrations used in this study are large and unlikely to be achieved
in vivo. it is therefore possible that trpv1 antagonism does not underlie
 xxxd1855xxx ’s clinical efficacy, but our observations may be used
as a basis for the design and development of clinically useful drugs to treat
conditions, such as cough, where trpv1 is thought to be involved.
although trpv1 is predominantly expressed on sensory neurones, we
and others have shown that it is also expressed in non-neuronal cells and
tissue. for example, trpv1 has been reported in keratinocytes, rat skeletal muscle cells, rat urethelial cells, myofibroblasts, and human dental pulp
fibroblasts [1, 10, 14–20]. in addition, trpv1 can be up-regulated. for example, yiangou and colleagues showed using immunostaining that trpv1
is up-regulated in the nerve fibres from patients with inflammatory bowel
syndrome [21]. moreover, trpv1 up-regulation has also been described
in chronic cough using immunostaining [10, 22]. we have previously reported that airway smooth muscle tissue from patients with chronic cough
displayed an increase in trpv1 protein when compared to healthy subjects

[10]. thus the fact that (1) trpv1 is up-regulated in the airways of patients
with chronic cough, (2) that trpv1 agonists induce the cough reflex, and
(3) that  xxxd1855xxx  inhibits trpv1 suggests an important role
for this antihistamine in the treatment of chronic cough.
there are a number of trpv1 antagonists available for use in in vitro
studies. these include capsazepine and iodoresiniferatoxin as well of a
range of newly synthesised antagonists including sb-705498, sb-366791, and
sb-452533 [23–27]. however, capsazepine and iodoresiniferatoxin are not
ideal for in vivo use. capazepine is not trpv1 specific as it is thought to interact with the  xxxg456xxx  and other channels, whereas
iodoresiniferatoxin can act as a partial agonist in vitro [28–30]. the current trpv1 antagonists in development, although are effective in vivo, still
require thorough in vitro and human studies. recently, jnj17203212 has
shown effective antitussive effects in guinea pigs but its safety and effectiveness in humans is still unknown [31]. however,  xxxd1855xxx  has
been widely used in man and extensive data confirm its safety and tolerability. therefore, our study indicates that  xxxd1855xxx  may currently
provide a clinically useful intervention in a wide range of illnesses recently
characterized by trpv1 activation.
