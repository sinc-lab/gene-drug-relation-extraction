treatments for skeletal muscle wasting and weakness ideally
possess both anabolic and ergogenic properties. although the
␤2-adrenoceptor agonist  xxxd1714xxx  has well-characterized
effects on skeletal muscle, less is known about the therapeutic potential of the related ␤2-adrenoceptor agonist  xxxd2098xxx .
we administered an equimolar dose of either  xxxd1714xxx  or
 xxxd2098xxx  to rats for 4 wk to compare their effects on skeletal
muscle and tested the hypothesis that  xxxd2098xxx  would produce more powerful anabolic and ergogenic effects.  xxxd1714xxx  treatment increased fiber cross-sectional area (csa)
by 6% and maximal isometric force (po) by 20% in extensor
digitorum longus (edl) muscles, whereas fiber csa in soleus
muscles decreased by 3% and po was unchanged, compared
with untreated controls. in the edl muscles,  xxxd2098xxx  treatment increased fiber csa by 20% and increased po by 12%
above values achieved after  xxxd1714xxx  treatment. soleus
muscles of  xxxd2098xxx -treated rats exhibited a 13% increase in
fiber csa and a 17% increase in po above that of clenbuteroltreated rats. these data indicate that  xxxd2098xxx  has greater
effects on the functional properties of rat skeletal muscles
than  xxxd1714xxx .

of muscle mass is a risk factor for mortality in a number of conditions and disease states. the
loss of protein from skeletal muscle can lead to severe
and progressive muscle fiber wasting (atrophy) and
weakness, including that responsible for the death of
boys with duchenne muscular dystrophy, but also for
other conditions, including prolonged sepsis, surgical
trauma, sarcopenia, cancer cachexia, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, radiotherapy, chemotherapy,
burn injury, and chronic renal failure (5, 21, 42), where
the ability of an individual to carry out the tasks of
daily living is impaired dramatically (22, 23). therapies to alleviate the symptoms of muscle wasting are
directed toward preserving existing muscle fibers, en-

hancing muscle fiber regeneration, and promoting
muscle fiber growth. agents that stimulate an increase
in muscle size (hypertrophy), by either increasing protein synthesis, decreasing protein degradation, or both,
have the potential to be applied clinically to combat
muscle wasting conditions (21–23).
synthetic ␤2-adrenoceptor agonists (␤2-agonists)
were developed primarily to facilitate dilation of the
bronchiolar smooth muscle in asthma patients (2).
however, it became apparent that at high doses ␤2agonists caused an increase in body mass, which was
later attributed to an increase in skeletal muscle mass
(11). not surprisingly, ␤2-agonists such as  xxxd1714xxx 
were examined for possible application in the livestock
industry with the aim of promoting muscle growth and
hence improving the efficiency of meat production (26,
39–41).  xxxd1714xxx  has been described as one of the
most potent synthetic ␤2-agonists for producing increases in skeletal muscle mass (6, 10, 19, 34) and has
been examined extensively as a treatment for a number of animal models of muscle wasting disorders in an
attempt to ameliorate muscle atrophy (5, 7, 21–23). in
addition to causing significant increases in muscle
mass in animals (23),  xxxd1714xxx  can also cause a
dynamic shift in fiber proportions within skeletal muscle, from slow, fatigue-resistant type i fibers toward
the faster, and more fatigue-susceptible type iia, iib,
and iid/x isoforms (14, 44).
the potential for ␤2-agonists to improve the size and
strength of muscles of human patients affected by
neuromuscular diseases has received only limited attention (20, 27). orthopedic patients administered 20
␮g  xxxd1714xxx  twice daily for 4 wk did not exhibit any
improvement in the absolute strength of their knee
extensor muscles compared with patients given placebo (27). a 3-mo pilot trial of albuterol (16 mg/day)
given to 15 patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy led to improved maximum voluntary
isometric contractile performance, and this was followed by a year-long randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial where patients were treated with up
to 16 mg of albuterol twice daily (20). although maxithe costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the
payment of page charges. the article must therefore be hereby

effects of  xxxd2098xxx  and  xxxd1714xxx  on muscle function

mum voluntary isometric strength was not higher after
treatment, there were improvements in other measures, such as muscle mass and grip strength, indicating that treatment strategies involving ␤2-agonists
have clinical merit (20).
studies on animals have shown that ␤2-agonists
such as  xxxd1714xxx  affect skeletal muscles, but they
also affect the heart deleteriously, as evidenced by
tachycardia, cardiac hypertrophy, and decreased cardiac performance (10, 23, 25). at present, the dose
required to ameliorate skeletal muscle wasting exceeds
the estimated safe limit in humans (6), and adverse
effects such as cramps, tremors, insomnia, and nervousness, as reported in the clinical trial of kissel and
colleagues (20), clearly have to be minimized if ␤2agonists are to have greater therapeutic application for
treating muscle wasting disorders. our purpose was to
examine whether other ␤2-agonists have greater clinical potential than the most well-characterized,  xxxd1714xxx . if another ␤2-agonist produced a greater anabolic effect on muscle at a similar or lower dose, then
such a compound would have significant clinical application.
 xxxd2098xxx  is a synthetic ␤2-agonist that is a full
agonist at the ␤2-adrenoceptor, unlike  xxxd1714xxx ,
which is a partial agonist, and has been shown to be a
full ␤1-adrenoceptor agonist capable of producing a
maximum ␤-adrenoceptor-activated camp response (4,
29). in isolated human papillary muscle preparations,
 xxxd2098xxx  exerts a direct positive inotropic effect in the
heart mediated by ␤1- and ␤2-adrenoceptors (30). acute
intravenous administration of  xxxd2098xxx  to anesthetized dogs did not affect diaphragm muscle contractility in the resting state, but it did improve contractility
during fatigue (43).  xxxd2098xxx  given to lambs in their
food for 8 wk did not increase the mass of their infraspinatus or pectoralis profundus muscles (13). daily
subcutaneous injections of  xxxd2098xxx  (1 mg/kg) for 19
days increased the gastrocnemius muscle mass in rats
by ⬃12.5% (11). however, no studies have compared
the efficacy of  xxxd2098xxx  and  xxxd1714xxx  treatment on
skeletal muscle function in rats. to this end, we tested
the hypothesis that, due to the involvement of both
␤1-/␤2-adrenoceptors and a greater cellular response,
 xxxd2098xxx  would produce greater anabolic and ergogenic
effects on skeletal muscle than an equimolar dose of
 xxxd1714xxx .
methods

all experiments were approved by the animal experimentation ethics committee of the university of melbourne and
were conducted in accordance with the guidelines for the care
and use of experimental animals as outlined by the national
health and medical research council of australia and in
accordance with the american physiological society’s “guiding principles for research involving animals and human
beings” (1).
animals. young adult (4 mo old) male sprague-dawley
rats (290–300 g) were randomly allocated into one of three
groups that were housed in standard cages with a 12:12-h
light-dark cycle and provided with food (rat chow) and water
ad libitum. treated rats received equimolar doses of clenajp-regul integr comp physiol • vol

r1387

buterol (2 mg 䡠 kg⫺1 day⫺1) or  xxxd2098xxx  (2.8 mg 䡠 kg⫺1 day⫺1)
administered via intraperitoneal injections in 1 ml of isotonic
saline every day for 4 wk. control rats received a daily
injection of an identical volume of saline vehicle. this concentration of  xxxd1714xxx  produces significant increases in
muscle mass with minimal ␤-adrenoceptor desensitization
(10, 14) and therefore provided a standard treatment dose for
comparison with  xxxd2098xxx .  xxxd1714xxx  and  xxxd2098xxx  were
obtained from sigma-aldrich (castle hill, new south wales,
australia).
tissue harvest. at the completion of the 4-wk treatment
period, rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium
(nembutal, rhone merieux, pinkenba, queensland, australia; 60 mg/kg ip), with supplemental doses administered to
maintain an adequate depth of anesthesia, such that there
was no response to tactile stimulation. the edl (fast twitch)
and the soleus (slow twitch) muscles from the left hindlimb
were surgically exposed, and a length of silk suture (3-0,
pearsalls suture, somerset, uk) was tied to the proximal
and distal tendons of the muscles. the associated nerve and
vessel supplies were cut last to ensure optimum condition of
muscles before entering the organ bath. the excised muscles
were blotted once on filter paper and immediately placed into
a custom-built plexiglas chamber filled with krebs-ringer
solution [composition (in mm): 1.37 nacl, 24 nahco3, 11
d-glucose, 5 kcl, 2 cacl2, 1 nah2po4 䡠 h2o, 0.487  xxxd2534xxx  䡠
7h2o, 0.293 d- xxxd3456xxx  chloride] oxygenated with 95%
o2-5% co2 (boc gases, preston, victoria, australia) and
thermostatically maintained at 25°c, which is optimal for
maintaining the viability of the muscles in vitro for the
duration of the experimental protocol (37).
rats were euthanized by excision of the heart, which was
trimmed of connective tissue, weighed, frozen in thawing
isopentane, and stored at ⫺80°c pending measurement of ␤1and ␤2-adrenoceptor density. the left and right adrenal
glands were excised, trimmed, blotted, and then weighed on
an analytical balance.
muscle contractile measurements. contractile properties of
the left edl and soleus were assessed in vitro according to
methods described in detail previously (14, 24, 33). briefly,
the distal tendon of the muscle was tied to a fixed pin in the
organ bath, while the proximal tendon was attached to the
lever arm of a dual-mode servomotor (305-lr, aurora scientific, aurora, ontario, canada). platinum plate electrodes
flanked the muscle on either side. muscles were field stimulated by supramaximal square-wave pulses (0.2-ms duration)
that were amplified (ep500b power amplifier, audio assemblers, campbellfield, victoria, australia) to produce a current
intensity sufficient to produce a maximum isometric tetanic
contraction (po). the servomotor and stimulation operations
were controlled by custom-built applications (d. r. stom
software solutions, ann arbor, mi) of labview software
(national instruments, austin, tx) driving a personal computer with on-board controller (pci-mio-16xe-10, national
instruments) interfaced with the servomotor control/feedback position controller hardware (6650lr dual-mode lever
system, aurora scientific, canada). optimum muscle length
(lo) was determined from maximum isometric twitch force
(pt). optimum fiber length (lf) was determined by multiplying lo by the previously determined fiber length-to-muscle
ratio of 0.44 for the edl and 0.71 for the soleus muscle
(14, 33).
a frequency-force curve was established after successive
stimuli  xxxd1891xxx –150 hz for edl muscles and 5–120 hz for
soleus muscles, with 2 min rest between stimuli. po was
determined from the plateau of the frequency-force relationship, after which the muscle was subjected to a 4-min stim283 • december 2002 •

ulation protocol to induce muscle fatigue. muscles were stimulated once every 5 s at optimum length, voltage, and
frequency, with a stimulation duration of 350 ms for the edl
and 1,200 ms for the soleus muscles. po was also determined
5 and 10 min after the completion of the fatigue protocol as a
measure of the ability of the muscles to recover their maximum force-producing capacity after repeated intermittent
contractions.
after all measurements, the muscle was trimmed of connective tissue and weighed. specific force (kn/m2) was determined for each muscle according to standard procedures
taking into account cross-sectional area (csa), i.e., muscle
mass divided by the product of lf and 1.06 mg/mm3, the
density of mammalian skeletal muscle (28). muscles were
frozen in thawing isopentane for later histological/histochemical examination and radioligand binding assays.
histology and histochemistry. a portion of each frozen
muscle sample was cryosectioned transversely through the
midbelly region on a cryostat microtome at ⫺20°c (cti
cryostat, iec, needham heights, ma). eight 8-␮m thick
serial sections, from each of edl and soleus muscle, were cut
and placed onto uncoated glass microscope slides. two edl
and two soleus muscle cross sections were placed onto each
labeled slide (total of 4 sections per slide) and stored in an
airtight container at ⫺20°c overnight.
one slide was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (h & e)
to determine muscle fiber csa and general muscle architecture, while another was used to determine succinate dehydrogenase (sdh) activity (14), based on a modified version of
the method by blanco and colleagues (3). briefly, sections
were incubated [in mm: 33 sodium succinate, 33 phosphate
buffer (ph 7.6), 1 sodium azide, 0.612 nitroblue tetrazolium]
for 60 min at 37°c to produce a colored nitroblue-diformazan
precipitate indicator according to increasing sdh activity
within the muscle fibers in the sections. the reaction was
terminated by multiple rinses in distilled water and then
air-dried and placed under a coverslip. individual muscle
fibers were classified according to their sdh activity (high or
low reactivity in edl muscles; high or very high reactivity in
soleus muscles) by interactive determination of the histochemical reaction intensity of individual fibers (3, 14).
the remaining slides were used to determine muscle fibertype proportions according to myosin atpase (matpase)
reactivity, utilizing the method of hämäläinen and pette
(15). serial sections were preincubated at ph 4.3 and 4.55,
which identifies four individual muscle fiber types (type i,
iia, iib, and iid/x). at the completion of the procedure,
muscle sections were dehydrated in serial concentrations of
ethanol and were placed under coverslips. muscle fibers were
classified according to their matpase activity by interactive
determination of fiber histochemical reaction intensity (15).
images of all sections were acquired using a digital imaging camera (spot model 1.3.0, diagnostic instruments, sterling heights, mi) attached to an upright microscope (bh-2,
olympus, tokyo, japan). a field of view (900 ⫻ 750 ␮m) was
chosen at random from the h & e-stained section, and the
same field was acquired from the sdh- and the matpasereacted sections. image files were analyzed using image pro
(version 4.0, media cybernetics, silver spring, md) in a
double-blinded manner. the mean csa of individual muscle
fibers was calculated by interactive determination of the
circumference of no less than 120 adjacent fibers from the
center of every muscle section.
␤-adrenoceptor density. frozen edl and soleus muscle
samples were placed in 5 ml of ice-cold buffer a [in mm: 50
tris (ph 7.0), 250 sucrose, 1 egta; ph 7.4 at 4°c] and
homogenized (polytron pt 2100, kinematica ag, luzernerajp-regul integr comp physiol • vol

strasse, switzerland) separately for 30 s. cell membrane
fragments were prepared by centrifugation at 4°c, based on
the previous work of sillence and colleagues (38, 39). briefly,
the homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 g
(avanti j-25i centrifuge, ja-17 rotor, beckman, ca). the
supernatant was filtered through three layers of surgical
gauze (smith and nephew, victoria, australia) and centrifuged for a further 15 min  xxxd1891xxx ,000 g. the supernatant was
ultracentrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 g (l7 ultracentrifuge,
sw4iti rotor, beckman, ca), and the pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer b [in mm: 50 tris (ph 7.7),
10 mgcl2, 150 nacl; ph 7.4 at 37°c] using a pasteur pipette.
the resuspended pellet was stored at ⫺80°c for 4 days before
analysis.
the procedure used for the radioligand binding assay utilized the methodology of sillence and colleagues (41). frozen
cell membrane pellets were thawed, resuspended in buffer,
and then vortexed for 30 s. protein concentration was determined by the bradford protein assay (bio-rad, richmond,
va) with bsa standards. the membrane suspension was
used at an assay concentration of 0.2 mg/ml because previous
studies had shown that binding of the radioligand to ␤2adrenoceptor sites was linear over the protein concentration
range of 0.05–0.3 mg/ml (41).
because of the limited quantity of membrane protein obtained from these small muscles, single point saturation
assays were performed by incubating 400 ␮l cell membrane
suspension with 50 ␮l [125i]iodocyanopindolol (135 pm;
icyp, the radioligand), and 50 ␮l of either buffer b (to
determine the total counts of icyp bound to ␤2-adrenoceptors) or  xxxd3033xxx  (2 ␮m; a nonselective ␤-adrenoceptor
antagonist that determines nonspecific binding of icyp to
the membrane) in polyethylene tubes (12 ⫻ 75 mm). assays
were initiated with the addition of cell membranes, and tubes
were incubated for 90 min in a shaking water bath set at
37°c (130 cycles/min). separation of bound ligand from free
ligand was achieved by filtering the contents of each tube
through whatman gf-c glass fiber filter papers (whatman
gf-c filter paper, maidstone, uk) with 21 ml of ice-cold
buffer b using a cell harvester (brandel m-48r cell harvester,
biomedical research and development labs, gaithersburg,
md). radioactivity remaining on the filters was determined
in a gamma counter (1470 wizard-automatic gamma
counter, wallac oy, turku, finland) at a counting efficiency
of 78%. results were obtained as ␥-radiation counts per
minute for all tubes and then converted into concentration of
␤-adrenoceptor per milligram of protein (40, 41). previous
experiments have shown that rat muscle contains a predominant population of ␤2-adrenoceptors, with ␤1-adrenoceptors
usually undetectable by this technique (41). hence the ␤-adrenoceptors measured were designated ␤2-adrenoceptors.
the left ventricle from each animal was used to determine
the concentration of ␤1- and ␤2-adrenoceptors in cardiac
muscle tissue. samples within each treatment group (control,
 xxxd1714xxx , and  xxxd2098xxx ) were pooled such that there were
four samples/group (cardiac tissue from 2 rats/sample). cardiac muscle tissue membranes were prepared in the same
way as described for the edl and soleus muscles. the resuspended pellet was stored overnight at ⫺80°c before the
radioligand assay was performed. incubation tubes for the
cardiac tissue assay contained 150 ␮l cell membrane (working concentration of 0.3 mg/ml), 50 ␮l icyp (120 pm), and
one of the following: 50 ␮l buffer b (total counts of bound
icyp), 50 ␮l  xxxd3033xxx  (5 ␮m; nonspecific binding), or 50
␮l cgp-20712a (1 ␮m; a ␤1-selective antagonist) (40, 41).
total ␤-adrenoceptor binding was measured as the difference
between total binding and nonspecific binding (determined

results

skeletal muscle mass. after the 4-wk experimental
period, body mass (bm) was not different between any
of the three groups (table 1). the mass of the edl
muscle in  xxxd1714xxx -treated rats was 20% greater
than in the control rats and in  xxxd2098xxx -treated rats
was 27% greater than in control rats. the edl massto-bm ratio in  xxxd1714xxx -treated rats was 13%
greater than in control rats and 21% greater in  xxxd2098xxx -treated rats compared with controls (table 1).
soleus muscle mass was not different after  xxxd1714xxx  treatment, but  xxxd2098xxx -treated rats had a 26
and 18% greater muscle mass than control rats and
 xxxd1714xxx -treated rats, respectively. the soleus
mass-to-bm ratio in  xxxd1714xxx -treated rats was also
not different from control values, but  xxxd2098xxx -treated
rats had a 22% greater soleus mass-to-bm ratio than
control and  xxxd1714xxx -treated rats (table 1).
muscle fiber csa. the increased edl muscle mass
in  xxxd1714xxx -treated rats was associated with a 6%
increase in the average muscle fiber csa compared
with untreated controls.  xxxd2098xxx  treatment, however, increased the average edl muscle fiber csa by
27% above control and 20% above that in clenbuteroltreated rats. the increased soleus muscle mass in
 xxxd2098xxx -treated rats was also associated with a 9%
increase in average muscle fiber csa compared with
control rats and a 12% increase above that in  xxxd1714xxx -treated rats (table 1).

treated rats there was a 20% reduction in the proportion of type iia fibers compared with controls (fig. 1).
soleus muscles from  xxxd1714xxx -treated rats had a
reduced proportion (10%) of type i fibers and an increased proportion (6%) of type iid/x fibers compared
with control rats but no change in type iia fibers.
 xxxd2098xxx -treated rats also had a reduced proportion
(10%) of type i fibers compared with control rats, but
unlike in  xxxd1714xxx -treated rats, they had an increased proportion (11%) of type iia fibers compared
with control rats but no change in the proportion of
type ii d/x fibers (fig. 1).
csa of fast and slow muscle fibers. the csa of type
i, iia, and iib fibers from edl muscles of clenbuteroltreated rats was larger (12, 7, and 10%, respectively)
than in control rats (fig. 1).  xxxd2098xxx  treatment increased the csa of type i and iia fibers by 34%, type
iib fibers by 29%, and type iid/x fibers by 31% compared with edl muscles from untreated control rats.
the csa of type i, iia, iib, and iid/x fibers was also 19,
26, 17, and 28% greater, respectively, in edl muscles
of  xxxd2098xxx - than  xxxd1714xxx -treated rats (fig. 1).
the csa of type i and iid/x fibers in the soleus
muscles of  xxxd1714xxx -treated rats was 6 and 12%
smaller, respectively, than fibers from muscles of untreated control rats (fig. 1). the csa of type iia and
iid/x fibers in the soleus muscles of  xxxd2098xxx -treated
rats was 25 and 18% larger, respectively, than those
from muscles of untreated control rats. the csa of
type i, iia, and iid/x fibers was also 7, 33, and 38%
greater, respectively, with  xxxd2098xxx  than  xxxd1714xxx 
treatment (fig. 1).
skeletal muscle function. pt of edl and soleus muscles was not affected by  xxxd1714xxx  treatment, but
 xxxd2098xxx  treatment increased pt of edl muscles by
40% above control and 30% above  xxxd1714xxx -treated
rats. similarly,  xxxd2098xxx  treatment increased soleus pt
by 16% above that for control and  xxxd1714xxx -treated
rats. time to peak twitch tension (tpt), one-half relaxation time (½rt), and peak rate of twitch force
generation (dpt /dt) were not altered by  xxxd1714xxx , in
either the edl or soleus muscles.  xxxd2098xxx  treatment
increased dpt /dt by 27% in the edl muscle compared
with muscles from control and  xxxd1714xxx -treated rats,
but it had no effect on twitch contraction time. in the
soleus muscle,  xxxd2098xxx  dramatically reduced tpt and
½rt, and increased dpt /dt compared with values for
both control and  xxxd1714xxx -treated rats (table 2).
 xxxd1714xxx  treatment increased po of edl muscles
by 20% compared with control values, but po of soleus
muscles was not affected.  xxxd2098xxx  treatment increased po of edl muscles by 35% above control values
and 12% above values for  xxxd1714xxx -treated rats.

effects of  xxxd2098xxx  and  xxxd1714xxx  on muscle function

explanation would relate to differences between the
muscles in their proportion of fast type ii fibers (hypertrophied by ␤-agonists), but this is inconsistent
with our present observation that  xxxd1714xxx  showed
muscle selectivity, whereas  xxxd2098xxx  did not. indeed,
the increase in muscle mass caused by  xxxd2098xxx  in
soleus (26%) and edl muscles (27%) was strikingly
similar. differences in muscle responsiveness to  xxxd1714xxx  do not simply reflect ␤-adrenoceptor density, as
this was greater in soleus than in edl muscles. nor
have we found a close negative association between the
rate of receptor downregulation in various muscles and
their responsiveness to ␤-agonists. recent evidence
indicates that the mechanism of desensitization of
␤-adrenoceptors involves phosphorylation by specific
receptor kinases, the  xxxg676xxx   xxxg1336xxx  kinases. this phosphorylation is followed by binding of
arrestins to the receptors, which causes uncoupling of
receptors and g proteins and thus results in a loss of
receptor function (12). long-term desensitization often
involves a significant reduction in receptor numbers, or
receptor downregulation (8, 9). we propose that different skeletal muscles of the rat differ in the extent to
ajp-regul integr comp physiol • vol

which they contain other ␤-adrenoceptor subtypes
and/or in the efficiency with which their ␤-adrenoceptors are coupled to the second messenger system.
in addition to there being physiological differences
among skeletal muscles, there is a clear difference in
the pharmacological properties of the two drugs used
in this study. the lack of an anabolic effect of  xxxd1714xxx  compared with  xxxd2098xxx  in soleus muscles is
unlikely to be due to a difference in ␤2-adrenoceptor
binding affinity, as  xxxd1714xxx  binds to ␤2-adrenoceptors with an affinity five times greater than that of
 xxxd2098xxx  (18). instead, the difference could be accounted for by a different level of efficacy and/or a
difference in subtype selectivity for the two drugs.
our observation that unlike  xxxd1714xxx ,  xxxd2098xxx 
treatment caused comparable responses in the edl
and the soleus muscles, coupled with the knowledge
that  xxxd2098xxx  acts at both ␤1- and ␤2-adrenoceptors (4),
suggests that  xxxd2098xxx  might cause skeletal muscle
hypertrophy by actions at both adrenoceptors. previous studies have shown that when ␤2-adrenoceptors in
bovine skeletal muscle are selectively blocked using
ici-118551, it is still possible to obtain a maximum
camp response after stimulation with the nonselective
␤-adrenoceptor agonist  xxxd2398xxx . the  xxxd2398xxx 
response could be blocked by the ␤1-adrenoceptor-selective antagonist cgp-20712a, providing evidence for
the existence of a population of ␤1-adrenoceptors in
skeletal muscle that is small but efficiently coupled to
the second messenger (30, 38). hence, the greater effects observed in rat skeletal muscles after  xxxd2098xxx 
administration in the present study could be due to its
actions at both ␤1- and ␤2-adrenoceptors, resulting in a
greater cellular response.
 xxxd2098xxx  is said to be a full agonist at both adrenoceptors, that is, stimulation of a ␤-adrenoceptor by
 xxxd2098xxx  mediates a greater cellular response (production of camp, via the stimulatory g protein complex)
than stimulation by  xxxd1714xxx  (a partial agonist).
accordingly,  xxxd2098xxx  could be expected to cause a
greater increase in protein accretion (32). the mechanism for protein accretion after chronic ␤-agonist administration has been described recently by navegantes and colleagues (31). briefly, an increase in
adenylate cyclase production activates camp-dependent protein kinase, which inhibits the calpain and
 xxxg344xxx  pathways regulating proteolysis. additionally, these authors point out that the anabolic effects of
catecholamines on skeletal muscle could also be due to
stimulation of protein synthesis (31). although the
mechanism of action of  xxxd2098xxx  and  xxxd1714xxx  on
skeletal muscle is likely to be similar (31), the difference in efficacy may set these two agonists apart as
much as differences in their subtype selectivity.
 xxxd1714xxx  treatment did not alter the fatigue resistance of the edl or the soleus muscles, but it did
impair the recovery of force production in the fasttwitch edl muscles. in contrast,  xxxd2098xxx  treatment
increased the fatigability of edl muscles and impaired
the recovery of force in both the edl and soleus muscles. the impaired recovery of force in the soleus mus283 • december 2002 •

effects of  xxxd2098xxx  and  xxxd1714xxx  on muscle function

cles from  xxxd2098xxx -treated rats is likely mediated by
the shift in fiber proportions from slow type i toward
the faster type iia and iid/x fibers that are less resistant to fatigue. this notion, however, was not supported by observations in the edl muscles, where the
fast-twitch fiber proportions were unaffected by  xxxd1714xxx  treatment and only altered to a minor extent by
 xxxd2098xxx  treatment.
both  xxxd1714xxx  and  xxxd2098xxx  treatment mediated a
shift in fiber type proportions toward the faster type
iia and iid/x forms in soleus muscles, but only  xxxd2098xxx  treatment decreased the time course of contraction. no change in the tpt or ½rt, despite significant
changes in fiber proportions, supports the notion that
there may be other factors (such as sarcoplasmic reticulum function) contributing to these changes in contractility after  xxxd2098xxx  treatment.
while the results of these experiments demonstrate
unequivocally that  xxxd2098xxx  has greater effects on
structure and function of skeletal muscle than an
equimolar dose of  xxxd1714xxx , its effects on the heart
were similar to those of  xxxd1714xxx . previous studies
indicate that  xxxd1714xxx  administration is associated
with cardiac hypertrophy (10) and adrenal gland hypertrophy (19). in contrast to previous studies, in the
present study the mass of the adrenal glands from
 xxxd1714xxx -treated rats was not different from control
rats, possibly due to the shorter duration of treatment,
4 wk in this study compared with 7 wk reported previously (19). the ratio of adrenal mass to body mass
was not different in  xxxd2098xxx -treated rats, suggesting
that the increase in absolute adrenal mass can be
attributed solely to the overall increase in body mass
after treatment.
both  xxxd1714xxx  and  xxxd2098xxx  treatment caused a
large increase in absolute heart mass and heart mass
relative to body mass compared with control values.
these results suggest that both agonists also mediate
effects at ␤-adrenoceptors in the heart. our results
indicate that  xxxd2098xxx  binds to both ␤1- and ␤2-adrenoceptors in the heart (with a greater affinity for the
␤2-adrenoceptor) and thus mediates a greater cardiac
hypertrophy than that after  xxxd1714xxx  treatment,
which likely occurs via stimulation of ␤2-adrenoceptors
alone (40).
while these experiments demonstrate gross morphometric changes in heart mass, further studies
are required to fully determine whether  xxxd2098xxx  administration deleteriously affects cardiac function. if
 xxxd2098xxx  binds both ␤1- and ␤2-adrenoceptors in the
heart, then coadministration of a selective ␤1-antagonist with  xxxd2098xxx  might reduce cardiac hypertrophy.
as such, the anabolic effect of  xxxd2098xxx  in the heart
would be reduced, while the effects on skeletal muscle
structure and function would be maintained. this combined treatment would also uncover whether the coactivation of ␤1- with ␤2-adrenoceptors contributes to the
anabolic effects of  xxxd2098xxx . therefore, the combination of  xxxd2098xxx  with a selective ␤1-antagonist is worth
exploring, and further studies are warranted.

this experiment examined the effects of an equimolar dose of  xxxd2098xxx  or  xxxd1714xxx  on muscle function,
and the significantly greater effect of  xxxd2098xxx  is deserving of further investigation. the concentration of
 xxxd2098xxx  chosen for these experiments was based on
the optimal dose of  xxxd1714xxx  that we have used
previously to produce significant changes in muscle
structure and function (10, 14). an increase in muscle
functional capacity and muscle fiber size might be
achieved at lower concentrations of  xxxd2098xxx , with only
minimal concomitant cardiac hypertrophy. if a lower
dose of  xxxd2098xxx  is combined with a selective ␤1-antagonist, then it may be possible to eliminate the unwanted side effects associated with cardiac hypertrophy yet maintain a physiologically significant effect on
skeletal muscle function. only then will the full therapeutic potential of  xxxd2098xxx  treatment be realized.
