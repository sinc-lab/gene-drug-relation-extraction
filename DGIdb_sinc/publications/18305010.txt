a variety of drugs have been shown to modulate the binding of ligands allosterically to the primary recognition site
(orthosteric site) of muscarinic receptors (stockton et al.,
1983; birdsall and lazareno, 2005). allosterism is often analyzed within the context of the allosteric ternary complex
model as shown in fig. 1b, which illustrates that both orthosteric and allosteric ligands bind to their respective sites on
the same receptor with dissociation constants of kx and ka,
respectively (stockton et al., 1983; ehlert, 1988a). when both
ligands are bound to the receptor, their observed dissociation
constants (kobs) are modified by the factor ␣, which is a
measure of the cooperativity between the binding of the two
ligands. by considering that the ternary complex ( xxxd3000xxx )
might have an altered intrinsic efficacy (epsilon⬘) compared to that
of the binary (xr) complex (epsilon), it is possible to measure
allosteric modulation of intrinsic efficacy in functional experiments (ehlert, 1988a, 2005).
we can also consider the allosteric model at a deeper level

count for affinity-only modulation, even if multiple conformations of ground and active states were considered. we also
expanded the tandem two-site model (j biol chem 275:18836 –
18844, 2000) within the context of the allosteric ternary complex model and analyzed the resulting hybrid model at the level
of receptor states. this model posits that the agonist first binds
to a relay site and then shuttles to the activation site to turn on
the receptor. if it is assumed that allosterism occurs at the relay
site and not the activation site, then this model can account for
affinity-only modulation in a manner consistent with the allosteric ternary complex model.

of analysis and examine how the allosteric ligand changes
the affinity and intrinsic efficacy of the orthosteric ligandreceptor complex. the two-state allosteric model described
mathematically in fig. 1c and schematically in fig. 2a is the
simplest way to address this question. if the orthosteric and
allosteric ligands exhibit the same preference for the ground
and active states, then the interaction is positively cooperative (␣ ⬎ 1), whereas if the ligands exhibit the opposite
selectivity, the interaction is negatively cooperative (0 ⬍ ␣ ⬍
1). predictions from this model include a correlation between
the quality (negative or positive) and magnitude of the cooperativity and the intrinsic efficacy of the orthosteric ligandreceptor complex. in addition, if the orthosteric ligand lacks
sufficient intrinsic efficacy to activate the receptor completely at 100% occupancy in both the absence and presence
of the allosteric modulator, the modulation in affinity occurs
with a simultaneous modulation in the proportion of receptors in the active state at 100% receptor occupancy (i.e.,
efficacy modulation). heteromeric gabaa receptor subtypes
exhibit many of the predictions of the two-state allosteric
model with regard to benzodiazepines and other allosteric
modulators (ehlert et al., 1983; levitan et al., 1988; sigel and
baur, 1988).

abstract
we measured the influence of  xxxd2174xxx  on the functional responses and binding properties of selected agonists at the m2
muscarinic receptor and analyzed the data within the context of
the allosteric ternary complex model. our analysis showed that
 xxxd2174xxx  modified agonist affinity without influencing efficacy.
to explain this behavior, we investigated the allosteric ternary
complex model at a deeper level of analysis to assess allosterism in terms of the differential affinity of  xxxd2174xxx  for ground
and active states of the receptor. our simulations showed that
two-state models based on a single orthosteric site for the
agonist linked to an allosteric site for  xxxd2174xxx  could not ac-

the neuromuscular blocking agent  xxxd2174xxx  has been
shown to inhibit both functional responses and binding properties of orthosteric muscarinic ligands at the m2 muscarinic
receptor allosterically (clark and mitchelson, 1976; stockton
et al., 1983; ehlert, 1988b; lazareno and birdsall, 1995). so
far, only parallel shifts have been reported for the effect of
 xxxd2174xxx  on the concentration-response curves of agonists,
including the partial agonist bm5, suggesting that  xxxd2174xxx 
modifies the affinity of agonists without influencing their
intrinsic efficacy. in contrast, strychnine (lazareno and birdsall, 1995) and alcuronium (zahn et al., 2002) have been
shown to reduce both the potency and maximal responses of
muscarinic agonists through an allosteric mechanism. it has
been shown that the allosteric shift in the concentrationresponse curve of a full agonist for eliciting a downstream
response is equivalent to the product of the change in affinity
(p, eq. 9) and efficacy (q, eq. 10) caused by the modulator
(ehlert, 1988a, 2005). when the modulator is present at a
maximally effective concentration, these changes in observed
affinity and intrinsic efficacy are equivalent to the cooperativity constants ␣ and ␤ (see appendix). if  xxxd2174xxx  only
modulates the affinity of muscarinic agonists, its effect on the
potency of an agonist for eliciting a response should be equivalent to its effect on binding affinity.
in the present report, we have tested this postulate and
found that  xxxd2174xxx  only modulates the affinity of a group of
agonists. we show that this behavior is inconsistent with a
simple two-state allosteric model (figs. 1c and 2a) as well as
a more complex one exhibiting two ground and two active
conformations of the receptor (fig. 2b). given that studies on
mutagenesis (matsui et al., 1995; hulme et al., 2003) and the

fig. 2. expansion of the allosteric ternary complex model into various
two-state models. a, simple two-state model. the receptor complex exists
in two states, inactive and active. in the absence of ligands, the inactive
state of the receptor predominates. agonists and positive allosteric modulators bind to their respective orthosteric and allosteric sites and exhibit
selectivity for the active state, whereas negative modulators exhibit selectivity for the inactive state. b, complex two-state model. the receptor
complex exists in two states, inactive and active, each with two different
conformations. in the absence of ligands, the two conformations of the
inactive state of the receptor predominate. agonists and positive allosteric modulators bind to their respective orthosteric and allosteric sites and
exhibit selectivity for the active conformations, whereas negative modulators exhibit selectivity for the inactive conformations. c, tandem twosite, two-state model. the receptor complex has a superficially located
relay site (s1) that directs the agonist to the activation site (s2). the relay
site exists in two conformations that are linked to an allosteric binding
site. positive allosteric modulators select for a conformation that exhibits
high affinity for the orthosteric ligand and negative allosteric modulators
select for a conformation that exhibits low affinity for the orthosteric
ligand. the activation site exists in two states, inactive and active, which
undergo conformational changes independently of the relay site. in the
absence of an orthosteric ligand, the inactive state predominates. agonists exhibit selectivity for the active state.

kinetics of ligand binding (jakubik et al., 2000) suggest the
presence of an accessory site on the muscarinic receptor that
relays the orthosteric ligand to the primary activation site,
we have considered allosterism based on the tandem two-site
model of jakubik et al. (2000) (fig. 2c). we show that this
model can account for the selective modulation of agonist
affinity by  xxxd2174xxx  if it is assumed that allosterism occurs
at the relay site and not the activation site. although the
three models examined (fig. 2) differ at the level of receptor
states, they are all consistent at the level of receptor complexes, illustrating the usefulness of the simple allosteric
model (fig. 1b) in quantifying allosteric modulation.

fig. 1. hierarchical levels of analysis and the simple two-state model for
allosterism. a, on the surface, the binding of drug d to the receptor is
consistent with a simple one-site model characterized by kobs. b, at the
second level of analysis, the bound drug can be divided into two types of
complexes, a binary drug-receptor complex (dr) and a ternary drugreceptor-modulator complex (dra), exhibiting microscopic affinity constants of k1 and ␣k1, respectively. the concentration of d required for
half-maximal formation of each complex is equivalent to kobs. c, at the
third level of analysis, each type of receptor complex can be further
divided into two states, ground (r) and active (r*), each exhibiting a
unique, unvarying microscopic affinity constant. the concentration of d
required for half-maximal formation of the two states of each of the two
types of drug receptor complexes is equivalent to kobs.

cell culture. chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing the
human m2 muscarinic receptor (cho  xxxg448xxx  cells) were obtained from
acadia pharmaceuticals (san diego, ca) and cultured in dulbecco’s
modified eagle’s medium (dmem), with high glucose plus l-glutamine, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, sodium bicarbonate (3.7 g/l), and penicillin-streptomycin (100 u/ml) containing  xxxg418xxx 
(0.3 mg/ml) at 37°c in a humidified atmosphere with 5% co2.
 xxxd1773xxx  accumulation. muscarinic agonist-mediated inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp accumulation was measured in
cho  xxxg448xxx  cells using a modification of the [3h]adenine-prelabeling
method of schultz et al. (1972) and the chromatography procedure of
salomon et al. (1974). confluent cell monolayers grown in t75 flasks
were washed with dmem and then incubated in 9 ml of dmem
containing [3h]adenine (60 ␮ci) and adenine (3 ␮m) for 1 h at 37°c
in 5% co2. cells were washed twice with dmem and harvested
using trypsin. the resulting intact cell suspensions were centrifuged
for 10 min at 350g, suspended in krebs-ringer bicarbonate buffer
(krb buffer; 124 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 1.3 mm mgcl2, 26 mm
nahco3, 1.2 mm kh2po4, 1.8 mm cacl2, and 10 mm glucose) at ph
7.4 and centrifuged for a second time. cells were suspended in krb
buffer containing  xxxd2388xxx  (0.5 mm) and incubated
for an additional 10 min at 37°c before use in the camp assay.
muscarinic agonist-mediated inhibition of camp accumulation was
carried out in plastic tubes containing intact cells,  xxxd1742xxx  (10 ␮m),
 xxxd2388xxx  (0.5 mm), and various concentrations of
muscarinic agonist in a final volume of 0.35 ml of krb buffer. tubes
were incubated at 37°c for 12 min in a water bath. the reaction was
started by the addition of cells and was stopped by the addition of an
aliquot (0.2 ml) of ice-cold 30% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. after at
least 30 min on ice, the tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 3000g,
and an aliquot (0.5 ml) from each tube was applied to a column of 1.5
ml of dowex (ag-50w-x4, 200 – 400 mesh; sigma-aldrich, st. louis,
mo) and washed with two aliquots of water (1.25 ml each) to remove
[3h]atp. the [3h]camp was eluted onto a column of neutral alumina (0.6 g) with 4 ml of water and then eluted into scintillation vials
with 4 ml of 0.1 m imidazole hcl, ph 7.5. the samples were counted
by liquid scintillation spectroscopy.
intact cell binding assay. muscarinic receptor binding was
measured using [3h]n-methylscopolamine ([3h]nms, 80 ci/mmol;
perkinlife and analytical sciences, boston, ma). cho  xxxg448xxx  cells
were harvested as described above for the camp assay. cells were
suspended in an appropriate amount of krb buffer, such that specific [3h]nms binding never exceeded 20% of the total amount of
added [3h]nms. for agonist/[3h]nms competitive binding assays
measured in the absence and presence of  xxxd2174xxx  (10 ␮m), cell
suspensions were incubated for 15 min at 37°c in 1.0 ml of krb
buffer containing [3h]nms (1.0 nm) and various concentrations of
agonist. preliminary experiments in the absence and presence of
 xxxd2174xxx  (10 ␮m) showed that the competition curves were unaffected by a change in the incubation time from 10 to 30 min; consequently, we chose 15 min as our standard incubation time for these
experiments. in some experiments with  xxxd215xxx , we measured
binding in the presence of 100 ␮m  xxxd2174xxx . for these experiments,
we extended the incubation to 90 min (the control competition curve
was also incubated for 90 min), because we found that a shorter
incubation underestimated the effect of  xxxd2174xxx , whereas a longer,
3-h incubation yielded results similar to the 90-min incubation period. a 2-h incubation was used in experiments investigating the
influence of various concentrations of  xxxd2174xxx  on the binding of
[3h]nms. the incubation with [3h]nms was always started by the
addition of cells. all assays were run in triplicate, and nonspecific
binding was defined as the residual binding in the presence of 10 ␮m
atropine. specific [3h]nms binding was trapped by rapid filtration
on whatman glass fiber filters (g/fb) (whatman, clifton, nj) using
a cell harvester (brandel, gaithersburg, md). the filters were rinsed
with three aliquots (4 ml each) of ice-cold saline and counted.

analysis of biological data. the observed dissociation constant
of [3h]nms (kobs-nms) was estimated from the results of equilibrium
measurements of the specific binding (b) at various concentrations of
the radioligand. to estimate kobs-nms, the following equation was
fitted to the data by nonlinear regression analysis:

drug and chemicals. drugs and chemicals were obtained from
the following sources: [3h]adenine and [3h]nms were from
perkinelmer life and analytical sciences (boston, ma); dmem and
trypsin-edta were from invitrogen (carlsbad, ca); acetylcholine,
atropine, carbachol, and  xxxd2174xxx  were from sigma-aldrich; and
oxotremorine-m was from (sigma rbi, natick, ma). the compound
4-damp mustard was synthesized as described previously (thomas
et al., 1992).

influence of  xxxd2174xxx  on the binding of [3h]nms.
the influence of a single concentration of  xxxd2174xxx  (10 ␮m)
on the equilibrium binding of [3h]nms in intact cho cells
stably expressing the human m2 muscarinic receptor is
shown in fig. 3a. in the absence of  xxxd2174xxx , the [3h]nms
saturation curve was consistent with a simple one-site model
having a binding capacity of 64 fmol per assay and an observed dissociation constant of 0.144 nm (1/k1). in the presence of  xxxd2174xxx , the observed dissociation constant of
[3h]nms increased 8.3-fold to 1.20 nm without a significant
effect on binding capacity (f1,44 ⫽ 1.5; p ⫽ 0.23). we also
measured the influence of various concentrations of gal-

lamine on the binding of [3h]nms at a fixed concentration
(see fig. 3b).  xxxd2174xxx  caused a concentration-dependent
inhibition of [3h]nms binding with the ic50 for this effect
being 1.97 ␮m. over the concentration range investigated,
 xxxd2174xxx  did not fully displace specific [3h]nms binding,
but rather the binding reached a plateau of 21% at high
concentrations of  xxxd2174xxx . knowing this plateau value and
the equilibrium dissociation constant of [3h]nms, it is possible to estimate a cooperativity value ␣ of 0.060 for the
interaction between [3h]nms and  xxxd2174xxx  using eq. 3. it is
also possible to estimate the dissociation constant of  xxxd2174xxx  in the absence of [3h]nms using eq. 4 and the estimates of k1 and ␣. all of these parameter estimates are listed
in table 1. these results are consistent with the findings of
others (stockton et al., 1983).
influence of  xxxd2174xxx  on the binding of agonists.
we also investigated the influence of  xxxd2174xxx  on the binding affinities of the muscarinic agonists, acetylcholine,
s-aceclidine, carbachol, and oxotremorine-m in cho cells
stably expressing the human m2 muscarinic receptor. for
these experiments, we measured the competitive inhibition
of the binding of [3h]nms at a fixed concentration (approximately 1 nm) by increasing concentrations of the agonists.
we also repeated these experiments in the presence of a fixed
concentration of  xxxd2174xxx  (10 ␮m). the results of these
experiments are shown in fig. 4 where the agonist curves
have been scaled to the maximal binding observed in the
absence of agonist. this maximal binding value was inhibited
approximately 64% in the presence of  xxxd2174xxx  (10 ␮m). the
competition curves were consistent with a simple one-site
model having a hill slope of approximately 1.  xxxd2174xxx 
shifted the agonist/[3h]nms competition curves to the right
approximately 4-fold for each agonist. the ic50 values and
hill slopes for these competition curves are listed in table 2.
the ic50 value measured in the absence of  xxxd2174xxx  was
corrected for the competitive effect of [3h]nms using eq. 6 to
yield the true affinity constants of the agonists, and these
estimates are listed in table 1. with knowledge of the shift in
the competition curve caused by  xxxd2174xxx  as well as the
binding parameters of [3h]nms and  xxxd2174xxx  (see table 1),
it is possible to estimate the cooperativity constant (␣) for the
allosteric interaction between  xxxd2174xxx  and the agonists
using eq. 7. these cooperativity estimates are listed in table
1. compared to [3h]nms, which exhibited a 17-fold reduction
in affinity for the  xxxd2174xxx  occupied receptor compared to
the free receptor, the corresponding reduction in affinity for
agonists was approximately 100-fold.
we also investigated the influence of  xxxd2174xxx  at three
concentrations (3, 10, and 100 ␮m) on the binding of  xxxd215xxx  (fig. 4e). for the data obtained in the presence of 100 ␮m
 xxxd2174xxx  as well as a paired set of control binding measurements, we extended the incubation time to 90 min to ensure
that equilibrium was achieved as explained under materials
and methods. the data were calculated as described in the
previous paragraph. the ic50 values of the control inhibition
curve and those measured in the presence of 10 ␮m  xxxd2174xxx  are listed in table 2, and the average estimates of k1

maximal response at a submaximal level of receptor occupancy. to explore this issue, we treated cho cells with
cyclized 4-damp mustard [40 nm for 30 min; see thomas et
al. (1992)] to inactivate a portion of the m2 muscarinic receptor (fig. 5f). after washing the cells, we measured oxotremorine-m-mediated inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp accumulation in control and 4-damp mustard-treated cells.
treatment with 4-damp mustard caused a reduction in the
potency of oxotremorine-m (control, pec50 ⫽ 6.67; 4-damp

the predicted log shift has been calculated from the binding data shown in figs. 3 and 4 and table 1. the s.e.m. values for the theoretical log shift in binding affinity
were estimated assuming constant values for k2, the k1 of 关3h兴nms, and ␣ value for the  xxxd2174xxx -关3h兴nms interaction.

the modulator (ehlert (2005). thus, by comparing the total
effect of  xxxd2174xxx  in a functional assay (change in affinity
and efficacy), with its effect on observed affinity in a binding
assay (change in affinity only), it should be possible to dissect
out its modulatory effects on the affinity and intrinsic efficacy components of the agonist-receptor complex. when used
at a concentration of 10 ␮m,  xxxd2174xxx  caused shifts of approximately 14-fold in the concentration-response curves of
the various agonists. with the knowledge of true affinity
constant (k1) of each agonist as well as its cooperativity
constant (␣), it is possible to estimate the reduction in the
affinity of the agonist-receptor complex caused by  xxxd2174xxx 
using eq. 18 under appendix and the corresponding parameters estimated in binding assays. these calculations yielded
estimates of approximately 15-fold for the reduction in affinity of the agonist-receptor complex caused by  xxxd2174xxx   xxxd1891xxx 
␮m. we also calculated that the theoretical shifts for the
other concentrations of  xxxd2174xxx  used functional assays
with  xxxd215xxx  and oxotremorine-m. these estimates of the
predicted reduction in affinity are listed in table 3 together
with the observed shift in the agonist concentration-response
curve. the close agreement between the two estimates shows
that the modulatory effect of  xxxd2174xxx  on the activity of the
agonists can be attributed entirely to a reduction in affinity.
mathematical modeling
to understand the mechanism for the selective modulation
in agonist affinity by  xxxd2174xxx , we explored three distinct
allosteric models of two general types. the first type represents a standard two-state model having ground and active
states of the receptor, with orthosteric and allosteric binding
sites, in which the degree of receptor activation is proportional to the amount of receptor in the active state. within
this context, we have explored two subtypes of models, the
first having only one conformation of each state (simple twostate model) and the second having two ground and two
active conformations (complex two-state model). the second

overall type of model that we have explored was the tandem
two-site model of jakubik et al. (2000). this model posits that
the orthosteric ligand first binds upon the receptor at a relay
site and then shuttles to the activation site of the receptor.
both sites contribute to the overall affinity of the orthosteric
ligand, but only the activation site triggers the stimulus. this
model introduces the possibility that allosteric regulation can
occur at the relay site, the activation site, or both. in our
analysis, we explored the allosteric regulation at the relay
site only, because such a mechanism can easily explain why
only the affinity of orthosteric agonists is modulated by  xxxd2174xxx  and not intrinsic efficacy. we considered that both the
relay site and the activation site exist in two conformations.
the two conformations of the relay site contribute to affinity
only, whereas the two conformations of the activation site
represent ground and active states. thus, these states contribute to both affinity and intrinsic efficacy.
our modeling addresses three hierarchical levels of analysis. at the first level, all three models are equivalent and
can be described by a simple one-site model having an observed dissociation constant (kobs) that we express in units of
molarity (see fig. 1a). at the second level, all three models
are also equivalent and can be described by the simple allosteric ternary complex model shown in fig. 1b. at this level
of analysis, we use affinity constants with inverse molarity
units and cooperativity constants (e.g., ␣) to describe the
microscopic binding affinities of the binary (xr, ra) and
ternary ( xxxd3000xxx ) complexes. at both the first and second levels,
the tandem two-site model is more complicated than the
state models, yet it still reduces to the simple allosteric
ternary complex model (see discussion and appendix, eqs. 52
and 53). at the third level of analysis, the three models are
distinct and characterized by a unique set of microscopic
affinity constants for different conformations of the receptor
(figs. 1c, 8c, and 10c). these are expressed in inverse molarity units. we do not use cooperativity constants at this level

fig. 6. simulation of the simple two-state model for allosterism. a, the
logarithm of the cooperativity constants describing the change in observed affinity (␣) and intrinsic efficacy (␤) of the agonist-receptor-positive allosteric modulator complex is plotted against the logarithm of the
ratio of microscopic affinity constants of the orthosteric ligand for the
active (kb) and inactive (ka) states of the receptor. also shown is the
product of the cooperativity constants (␣␤). for this simulation, very little
receptor (0.1%) is in the active state in the absence of orthosteric ligand
(ki ⫽ 10⫺3). the ratio of microscopic affinity constants of the allosteric
ligand for the active (kf) and inactive (ke) states of the receptor are
indicated in the figure. b, the same as a with the exception that the
corresponding values for a negative allosteric modulator are shown the ␣
and ␤ values were estimated using eqs. 21 and 31, respectively.

an  xxxd1422xxx  (kb/ka ⬍ 1) or neutral antagonist (1 ⬍
kb/ka ⬍⬍ 1/ki) or agonist (kb/ka ⬎⬎ 1), depending upon its
selectivity for the ground and active states. highly efficacious
agonists have very large kb/ka ratios. figure 6a shows that
a positive allosteric modulator with selectivity for the active
state (kf/ke ⫽ 100) exhibits positive cooperativity with an
agonist and no cooperativity (␣ ⫽ 1) with a neutral antagonist or  xxxd1422xxx . a positive modulator would exhibit
negative cooperativity with an  xxxd1422xxx  if the selectivity of the modulator for the active state were sufficient (kf/
ke ⬎ 103) to overcome the large tendency for the free receptor
to exist in the inactive state (ki ⫽ 10⫺3). a complementary
effect is seen with the negative allosteric modulator; that is,
the modulator exhibits negative cooperativity with agonists
and no cooperativity (␣ ⫽ 1) with a neutral antagonist or
 xxxd1422xxx . in the latter case, there is no cooperativity
between an  xxxd1422xxx  and a negative allosteric modulator because the receptor is already in the inactive state in
the absence of ligands. with regard to agonists, the allosteric
modulation (␣) of affinity is proportional to the efficacy of the
agonist over a range of kb/ka ratios but reaches a plateau at
high ratios. this behavior is well established and has been
described previously (ehlert et al., 1983; ehlert, 1986; hall,
2000).
figure 6 also shows the effect of the allosteric modulator on
the change in the observed intrinsic efficacy of the orthosteric
ligand (␤) over a broad range of kb/ka values. the change in

of analysis because each conformation represents a unique
structure.
in most pharmacological experiments, it is only possible to
estimate the second-level parameters [i.e., the observed affinity of the orthosteric (k1) and allosteric (k2) ligands and
the maximal change in affinity (␣) and efficacy (␤) caused by
the allosteric modulator] and not the microscopic affinity
constants of the various states of the receptor (level 3 parameters). the goal of this analysis is to show how the secondlevel parameters are related to the level 3 parameters and
how, in some instances, it is possible to estimate the ratio of
microscopic affinity constants of the allosteric modulator for
different states of the receptor (e.g., kf/ke, two-state models).
our conformational analysis (level 3) is distinct from the
analysis described by hall (2000). in the latter analysis,
ground and active states of the receptor were considered, yet
the affinity of each state was under allosteric regulation and
could exhibit a range of observed affinities. this behavior can
only occur if each so-called state represents an equilibrium
among additional, undefined conformations with unique affinity constants. thus, it is impossible to determine whether
some of the cooperativity values explored by hall (2000) are
actually possible within the constraints of a two-state model.
in other words, to explore the consequences of an allosteric
model, one cannot simply assign different values to the cooperativity constants and see how the model behaves. rather,
one needs to assign different values to the microscopic constants that determine the cooperativity constants to explore
the permissible range of cooperativity constants. in this regard, we follow the convention for defining microscopic
constants established by monod et al. (1965) and others
(koshland et al., 1966; colquhoun and sakmann, 1985) and
designate each conformation as unique, with a distinct, unvarying affinity constant.
simple two-state model. figure 1 illustrates how the
allosteric model can be expanded to incorporate ground and
active states of a receptor. the resulting model is a simplified
form of that described by hall (2000), and its derivation has
been described within the context of the ternary complex
model (ehlert, 2000). each side of the allosteric model (fig.
1b) has been expanded into a square representing the equilibrium between inactive and active states of the receptor.
each square represents a vertical side of the cube shown in
fig. 1c. the top horizontal square of the cube represents all
receptor complexes in the active state, whereas the bottom
horizontal square denotes those of the inactive state. the
inactive and active states each have unique microscopic affinity constants for the orthosteric (ka and kb, respectively)
and allosteric ligands (kc and kd, respectively), and the equilibrium between the free forms of the states (r and r*) are
determined by the constant ki. all equilibria of the cube can
be described using these five constants, which are defined
under appendix.
figure 6 shows how positive (kf/ke ⫽ 100) and negative
(kf/ke ⫽ 0.01) allosteric modulators affect the change in
observed affinity (␣) and intrinsic efficacy (␤) of the orthosteric ligand-receptor complex. the values of log ␣ and ␤ are
plotted against the log of the ratio of microscopic affinity
constants of the orthosteric ligand for active and inactive
conformations of the receptor (kb/ka). in this example, very
little of the receptor is in the active state in the absence of
agonist (ki ⫽ 10⫺3). the orthosteric ligand can be defined as

␤ is related to the maximum of the receptor activation function (stimulus) for the orthosteric ligand. the maximum of
this function (observed intrinsic efficacy) in the presence of a
maximally effective concentration of the modulator divided
by that in its absence is defined as ␤ (eq. 31). when the
orthosteric ligand lacks a sufficiently large kb/ka value to
trigger a measurable response, it would be impossible to
measure the ␤ value through the analysis of a downstream
response. nonetheless, fig. 6 shows the theoretical ␤ values
over the complete range of kb/ka values of the orthosteric
ligand. both positive and negative allosteric modulators
cause corresponding changes in observed intrinsic efficacy in
addition to their effects on affinity. the product of their
combined effect on affinity and efficacy (␣␤) is constant and
equivalent to the ratio of microscopic affinity constants of the
allosteric ligand for the ground and active states of the receptor (kf/ke). the basis of this relationship is described in
eq. 33 under appendix. for very weak partial agonists, allosteric modulators primarily affect observed intrinsic efficacy.
if the intrinsic efficacy of the orthosteric ligand is high
enough so that it is capable of causing nearly complete receptor activation, even in the presence of the modulator (i.e.,
kbkfki/kake ⱖ 10), the allosteric modulation is manifest as a
change in observed affinity only.
figure 7 shows a simulation of the effect of allosteric modulators on the occupancy, stimulus, and response functions of
an agonist. in fig. 7a, the effects of maximally effective
concentrations of positive (kf/ke ⫽ 10) and negative (kf/ke ⫽
0.1) modulators on the occupancy and stimulus of an agonist
(kb/ka ⫽ 103) are shown. the positive modulator causes
increases in observed affinity and intrinsic efficacy corresponding to factors of 5.5 and 1.8, respectively. the product of
these two effects is equivalent to kf/ke of 10. the negative
modulator causes decreases in observed affinity and intrinsic
efficacy corresponding to factors of 0.55 and 0.18, respectively, with the product of these two effects equivalent to
kf/ke of 0.1. figure 7, b and c, shows the effects of a maximally effective concentrations of the same positive and negative modulators on the response to the agonist in a highly
sensitive system exhibiting a large receptor reserve (b) and in
a less sensitive one (c). the concentration-response curves
were generated using the operational model as described in
the legend to the figure. in the more sensitive system, the
positive and negative allosteric modulators shift the concentration-response curves 10-fold, without affecting the maximal response. it has been shown previously that this shift is
equivalent to the product ␣␤ (ehlert, 1988a, 2005) (i.e., 10 for
the positive modulator and 0.10 for the negative modulator),
which is also equivalent to kf/ke (eq. 33). in the less sensitive
system, the allosteric modulator causes changes in the potency and maximal response of the agonist. it is possible to
obtain independent estimates of ␣ and ␤ in this condition
through analysis of the concentration-response curves as described previously (ehlert, 2005). for the positive modulator,
this analysis yielded estimates of 5.5, 1.8, and 10 for ␣, ␤, and
their product, respectively. for the negative modulator, the
corresponding estimates are 0.18, 0.55, and 0.10.
complex two-state model. we investigated a two-state
model incorporating two ground conformations (r1, r2) and
two active conformations (r1* and r2*). we refer to this
model as the complex two-state model. as an aside, this is the
type of model required to explain the phenomenon of ligand-

rectangles form the tri-cubic equilibrium shown in fig. 8. the
affinity constants of the agonist for the two active conformations (r1* and r2*) are denoted as kb and kd, whereas those
for the two inactive conformations (r1 and r2) are ka and kc,
respectively. the corresponding affinity constants of the allosteric modulator are denoted as kf, kh, ke, and kg, respectively. the constants describing the sequential equilibrium
between the free forms of the various conformations (r1, r1*,
r2, and r2*) are denoted by ki, kj, and kk. all of the equilibria shown in the model can be described with these 11
constants, which are defined in fig. 8 and under appendix
together with the mathematical solution to the model.
the complex two-state model shown in fig. 8 is a simplification of all possible conformational changes. for example,
it is entirely possible that ground state r1 might change
directly into active conformation r2* without going through
the transition from r1 to r1* to r2 to r2*. for the purposes
of equilibrium, this matter is unimportant because a more
complex model incorporating the latter transition would
yield the same result as the simpler scheme shown in fig. 8.
thus, the model represents an oversimplification as far as

for allosterism. a, on the surface, the binding of drug d to the receptor is
consistent with a simple one-site model characterized by kobs. b, at the
second level of analysis, the bound drug can be divided into two types of
complexes, a binary drug-receptor complex (dr) and a ternary drugreceptor-modulator complex (dra), exhibiting microscopic affinity constants of k1 and ␣k1, respectively. the concentration of d required for
half-maximal formation of each complex is equivalent to kobs. c, at the
third level of analysis, each type of receptor complex can be further
divided into four states, two ground (r1 and r2) and two active (r1* and
r2*), each exhibiting a unique, unvarying microscopic affinity constant.
the concentration of d required for half-maximal formation of the four
states of each of the two types of drug receptor complexes is equivalent to

kinetics are concerned, but not with respect to equilibrium
behavior. with regard to conformational changes not specified in fig. 8, it is nonetheless possible to denote their equilibrium constants using the constants designated in the figure. for example, the constant governing the equilibrium
between r1 and r2* (i.e., r2*/r1) is equivalent to kikj.
it is possible to define the second-level parameters of the
allosteric model (k1, k2, ␣, and ␤) in terms of the constants of
the complex two-state model, and these definitions are shown
under appendix (eqs. 36 –38, 44). similar to the simple twostate model, the complex two-state model predicts changes in
both observed affinity and intrinsic efficacy in almost all
instances, with the exception of agonists with intrinsic efficacy so great that they are able to cause complete receptor
activation in both the presence and absence of the allosteric
modulator. unlike the consequences of the simple two-state
model, the effect of the allosteric modulator on the product ␣␤
varies for different orthosteric ligands in the more complex
model. the logarithm of the product ␣␤ represents a
weighted geometric average of the ratios of microscopic affinity constants of the allosteric modulator for the active and
inactive states of r1 (kf/ke) and r2 (kh/kg). thus, the value
of ␣␤ is bounded by the interval of kf/ke to kh/kg, and it
depends upon whether the allosteric modulator shifts the
equilibrium in the direction of r1 or r2, respectively (see
appendix, eqs. 46 – 47).
interesting deviations from the simple model occur when
the allosteric modulator selects for rare conformations of the
receptor in the more complex model. for example, suppose
that r1 is the most abundant form (99%) of the receptor
under basal conditions in the absence of modulator and that
agonist activation occurs mainly through a transition from
r1 to r1*. if the geometric average of the microscopic affinity
constants of the allosteric modulator for the r2 conformations is much higher affinity than that of the r1 conformation, the allosteric modulator can switch the activation step
to an r2 to r2* transition. in so doing, the allosteric modulator can change the pharmacological profile of the receptor.
that is, in the presence of the modulator, the rank orders of
observed affinity and intrinsic efficacy of a group of agonists
will change. this result occurs because one would expect that
the ratios of kb/ka and kd/kc would vary randomly among a
group of orthosteric ligands because the four conformations
(r1, r1*, r2, and r2*) represent unique structures having
unique structure-affinity relationships. in contrast, the simple two-state model predicts that positive allosteric modulators appear to increase the affinity and efficacy of all agonists, whereas negative modulators do the opposite without
altering the rank order of observed affinity and intrinsic
efficacy.
if it is assumed that the ratio of kb/ka is the same as kd/kc
for a given agonist, it is possible for an allosteric modulator to
cause affinity-only modulation provided that ke ⫽ kf ⫽ kg ⫽
kh. figure 9a shows the behavior of the model under these
conditions for a negative allosteric modulator. the values of
the microscopic affinity constants of the agonist and the
allosteric modulator are displayed graphically in fig. 9b. in
this simulation, the most abundant form of the receptor
under basal conditions is r1, and there is very little receptor
activation in the absence of agonist. as shown in fig. 9b, the
ratio of affinity constants of the orthosteric agonist for the
ground and active conformations of r1 (ka/kb ⫽ 100) is the

same as that of r2 (kc/kd ⫽ 100); however, the average
overall affinity for the r1 pair is greater than that of the r2
pair. in contrast, the allosteric modulator has equivalent
affinities for the ground and active conformations of r1 (ke/
kf ⫽ 1), as well as those of r2 (kg/kh ⫽ 1), but its affinities for
the r2 pair of conformations are greater than those for the r1
pair. this opposite selectivity of the agonist and modulator
for the r1 and r2 pairs of conformations results in negative
cooperativity as shown in fig. 9a. that is, the allosteric
modulator causes a reduction in the observed binding affinity
of the agonist. because of the unique values of the microscopic affinity constants, this reduction in agonist potency
occurs with no change in the maximum of the agonist activation curve, illustrating that the modulator has no influence
the intrinsic efficacy of the agonist. affinity-only modulation
can also occur with a positive allosteric modulator provided
that the orthosteric and allosteric ligands exhibit the same
preference for the r1 and r2 conformations and that the
ratios of ka/kb and kc/kd are constant for the agonist and
equal to one for the modulator.
this type of affinity-only allosteric modulation occurs because of the unique relationship among the parameters
shown in fig. 9b. other combinations of microscopic constants can yield affinity-only modulation. for example, the
ratio of agonist affinity constants for the ground and active
states of r1 and r2 could differ provided that the allosteric

it is possible that the activity of the two active states (r1*
and r2*) might differ. affinity-only modulation could still
occur in this situation provided that a corresponding difference in the ratio of agonist affinity constants for ground and
active states (ka/kb and kc/kd) or those of the allosteric
modulator offset the difference in activity of the two states.
these solution sets are unique enough to make it unlikely for
an orthosteric-allosteric ligand pair to exhibit affinity-only
modulation with this model. moreover, if a pair is found,
other agonists will not exhibit affinity-only modulation unless their ratios of ka/kb and kc/kd are the same as those of
the first pair. this scenario seems highly unlikely because
the four conformations of the receptor represent unique
structures with unique structure-affinity relationships.
tandem two-site, two-state model. within the context of a two-state model, it seems that  xxxd2174xxx  reduces a
component of agonist affinity for both the ground and active
states of the receptor to the same extent (ehlert, 2005). one
way to account for this enigma is to consider a model that
distributes the total observed affinity of the agonist over two
distinct sites—a distal site undergoing agonist-mediated activation and a more proximal site that relays the agonist to
the distal activation site. if allosteric modulators affect the
affinity of the relay site only, then only a modification in
affinity can occur. such a relay model has been proposed by
jakubik et al. (2000) to account for the two-step kinetics of
ligand binding to m1 and m2 muscarinic receptors, and these
investigators have suggested that a superficial  xxxd233xxx 
(asp99) in the m1 sequence is part of the relay site. hulme et
al. (2003) have suggested that trp157 in the m1 sequence may
act as a relay site, whereas matsui et al. (1995) have suggested that superficial tryptophan residues 91, 101, and 400
in the m1 sequence may line a cleft that guides orthosteric
ligands inwardly to the activation site. these residues are
highly conserved across all muscarinic receptor subtypes,
including the m2. a similar idea has been advanced for the
interaction of substrates with acetylcholinesterase (harel et
al., 1993). we have combined the tandem two-site model with
a two-state allosteric model to explain the cooperative interactions at the  xxxg448xxx  at the level of receptor states (level
3 analysis). figure 10 shows how the allosteric model (fig.
1b) can be incorporated into the tandem two-site model (fig.
10b). the tandem two-site model posits that there are two
sites on the receptor (s1 and s2) and that the agonist first
binds upon s1 and then transfers to s2 where receptor activation occurs. we postulate that there is an allosteric site on
s1 that modulates the affinity of orthosteric ligands for the s1
site, but not the s2 site. thus, the s1 site can exist in two
conformations (s1 and s1⬘), neither of which has an influence
on the activation of the receptor. the s2 site can exist in two
states, inactive (s2) and active (s2*), and the degree of receptor activation is proportional to the amount of receptors in
the active conformation. the microscopic affinity constants of
the orthosteric ligand for the two conformations of the relay
site (s1 and s1⬘) are denoted as ka and kb, respectively, and

similar to the model in fig. 8, the tandem two-site, twostate model is a simplification of all possible conformational
changes. for example, it is entirely possible for the s1s2
conformation to change directly into the s1s2* conformation

fig. 11. the tandem two-site, two-state model readily accounts for a
selective modulation in agonist affinity by negative and positive allosteric
modulators. the effects of positive and negative modulators on the occupancy (open symbols) and stimulus (closed symbols) curves for an agonist
are shown. for this simulation, very little (0.1%) of the activation site is
in the active state (s2*) in the absence of agonist (kh ⫽ 10⫺3), and very
little (1%) of the relay site is in the s1⬘ conformation in the absence of
ligands (kg ⫽ 10⫺2). the microscopic affinity constants of the agonist for

fig. 10. hierarchical levels of analysis and the tandem two-site, twostate model for allosterism. a, the tandem two-site model posits that the
drug d first binds upon the receptor at relay site s1 and then shuttles to
the activation site s2. on the surface, the binding of drug d to this circuit
of two sites is consistent with a simple one-site model characterized by
kobs equivalent to 1/(k1r ⫹ k1rk1a). b, at the second level of analysis,
bound drug can be divided into two main types of complexes, a binary
drug-receptor complex and a ternary drug-receptor-modulator complex.
each of these can be further divided, depending upon whether the drug is
occupying the relay site (ds1s2 and ds1as2) or the activation site (s1ds2
and s1ads2). the concentration of d required for half-maximal formation
of each complex is equivalent to kobs. c, at the third level of analysis, each
type of receptor complex can be further divided based on the state of the
relay site (s1 and s1⬘) and the activation site (s2 and s2*), each exhibiting
a unique, unvarying microscopic affinity constants. the concentration of
d required for half-maximal formation of the various combinations of
states of the various types of drug-receptor complexes is equivalent to
kobs.

without going through the transition from s1s2 to s1⬘s2 to
s1⬘s2* to s1s2*. for the purposes of equilibrium, this matter
is unimportant because a more complex model incorporating
the latter transition would yield the same result as the simpler scheme shown in fig. 10.
figure 11 shows the influence of a positive (kf/ke ⬎ 1) and
a negative (kf/ke ⬍ 1) allosteric modulator on the occupancy
and activation curves of an agonist (kd/kc ⫽ 2 ⫻ 103). in both
cases, the modulator shifts the occupancy curve without influencing the maximal degree of receptor activation. consequently, the tandem two-site, two-state model explains affinity-only modulation of agonist responses regardless of the
solution set of parameters. furthermore, because the allosteric regulation occurs at the relay site and not the activation
site, the model can account for the well known observation
that the cooperative effects of  xxxd2174xxx  are independent of
the magnitude of the efficacy of the orthosteric ligand. this
property can be appreciated mathematically by examining
fig. 10, which shows that the propensity of the agonist to
shuttle to the active state s2* (kd) relative to inactive state
s2 (kc) is proportional to efficacy, whereas the cooperativity
constant ␣ is unaffected by these constants (see eq. 57 under
appendix). the model can also explain the reciprocal modulation of the affinity of orthosteric and allosteric ligands.
that is, through application of the equations under appendix
it can be shown that, if  xxxd2174xxx  reduces the affinity of
[3h]nms, the tandem two-site two-state model predicts that
[3h]nms should reduce the affinity of  xxxd2174xxx  to the same
extent.
relationship of the state models to the allosteric
ternary complex model. it is important to emphasize that
the three models investigated are all consistent at the second

allosteric modulation of the muscarinic  xxxg448xxx 

level of analysis; that is, they are consistent with the allosteric ternary complex model (figs. 1b, 8b, and 10b). this model
is the level at which allosterism is usually measured experimentally. at this level, the models predict that the orthosteric ligand binds according to a simple one-site model exhibiting an observed dissociation constant equivalent to 1/k1,
with k1 ⫽ k1-r ⫹ k1-rk1-a for the tandem two-site model. all
three models predict that the effect of the allosteric modulator is to cause a multiplicative change in the observed dissociation constant by the factor p (see appendix, eqs. 15–18,
with level 2 parameters defined in eqs. 19 –21 for the simple
model, eqs. 36 –38 for the complex model, and eqs. 50 to 53 for
the tandem model, with level 2 parameters defined in eqs.

in this equation, ␤ denotes the intrinsic efficacy of the
agonist when the allosteric site is occupied, expressed relative to that of the complex, when the allosteric site is empty.
it may seem that the constants for cooperativity and efficacy
(␣ and ␤) are independent parameters that are unique to the
particular orthosteric-allosteric ligand pair. our analysis
shows that the second-level parameters ␣ and ␤ of the simple

two-state models do not vary independently but are highly
correlated. the more complex two-state model also predicts
simultaneous changes in both parameters with allosteric
modulation, although the magnitude of the changes may be
uncorrelated. in contrast, the tandem two-site, two-state
model for allosterism predicts affinity-only modulation provided that the allosteric site is linked only to the relay site.
it is interesting to consider allosterism from different perspectives relating to the definition of affinity and efficacy.
pharmacologists typically define observed affinity and observed intrinsic efficacy as the ec50 (kobs) and emax (epsilon) values of the stimulus function (receptor activation) (furchgott,
1966). electrophysiologists studying ligand-gated ion channels have defined affinity and efficacy (gating) at a deeper
level of analysis (colquhoun, 1998). affinity defines how the
agonist would bind if it did not induce a conformational
change in the receptor, and intrinsic efficacy is defined as the
propensity of the agonist to induce a conformational change
(i.e., ka and kbki/ka, respectively, in the simple two-state
model). tables 4 and 5 list these two different hierarchical
definitions of affinity and efficacy for the three different
models and describe the influence of a maximally effective
concentration of an allosteric modulator on each parameter.
at the level of the stimulus (table 4), both two-state models
predict that an allosteric modulator simultaneously influences both the observed affinity and observed intrinsic efficacy of the agonist, whereas the tandem two-site, two-state
model predicts affinity-only modulation. at the level of receptor states (third level), the definition of intrinsic efficacy is
such that simple two-state model predicts efficacy-only modulation; the tandem two-site, two-state model predicts affinity-only modulation; and the complex two-state model pre-

analysis of allosterism at g protein-linked receptors and ligand-gated ion channels using two-state
models. the allosteric ternary complex model has been extended previously to account for ground and active conformations of the receptor. in the model of hall (2000), two states
of the receptor are proposed, but the states are allowed to
assume any conformation, which leads to the introduction of
cooperativity constants that are undefined in terms of microscopic constants for receptor conformations. this convention
has led to the assumption that the cooperativity constants for
affinity (␣) and efficacy (␤) modulation [␥ and ␦, respectively
in the model of hall (2000)] are independent parameters of
two-state allosteric models. as described above, however,
these parameters are not independent in two-state models,
and affinity-only modulation defined in table 5 is an unlikely
outcome of such a model. as illustrated with the behavior of
 xxxd2174xxx , the models described in this report enable one to
address the origin of cooperativity in two-state models and
to assess what mechanisms can account for the measured
cooperativity.
for example, one phenomenon that is thought to be a
consequence of the extended allosteric ternary complex
model is the ability of two neutral ligands to interact allosterically to produce a response, even though each ligand
lacks selectivity for the active state (hall, 2000). according to
the complex two-state allosteric model, this phenomenon
could occur if there were two pairs (r1 and r2) of ground and
active states in equal abundance (kj ⫽ 1) and if the orthosteric ligand acted as an  xxxd1422xxx  at r1 (kb ⬍ ka) and
an agonist at r2 (kd ⬎ kc). the net effect is that inverse

agonism at r1 is opposed by agonism at r2, resulting in no
net receptor activation. if the allosteric ligand behaved like
that shown in fig. 9 and was selected for the r2 pair without
activating it (kg ⫽ kh ⬎ ke ⫽ kf), the pair of ligands could
produce a response together, although either ligand by itself
would have no effect on receptor activation. the same phenomenon could occur if the roles of the ligands were reversed.
however, this exotic explanation seems unlikely. the simple
two-state model readily accounts for the phenomenon of coagonism in terms of positive cooperativity between two interacting ligands— each exhibiting selectivity for the active
state (kb/ka ⬎ 1 and kf/ke ⬎ 1)—although the amount of
selectivity is insufficient for either one to elicit a response by
itself (kb/ka ⬍⬍ 1/ki and kf/ke ⬍⬍ 1/ki). an analogous form
of homotropic cooperativity is commonplace at oligomeric,
ligand-gated ion channels. often, the binding of more than
one agonist molecule is required for channel opening (e.g.,
 xxxg456xxx ).
it has also been suggested that the extended allosteric
ternary complex model can account for the phenomenon
whereby a modulator increases the affinity (␣ ⬎ 1) and reduces the efficacy (␤ ⬍ 1) of an agonist simply by changing
the amount of active receptor complex and its observed affinity (hall, 2000). according to the complex two-state model,
this phenomenon could occur if there were two pairs of agonist conformations (r1 and r2) and if the agonist activated
the more abundant pair (r1, kb ⬎⬎ ka) but behaved as an
 xxxd1422xxx  (r2, kd ⬍⬍ kc) with much higher affinity
(kd ⬎ kb) at the less abundant pair of conformations (kj ⬍⬍
1). if the modulator behaved like that shown in fig. 9 and
selected for the less abundant pair of conformations (kg ⫽
kh ⬎ ke ⫽ kf), it would cause an increase in affinity and
decrease in efficacy of the agonist-receptor complex. however, once again, such a complicated mechanism seems unlikely. a much simpler mechanism is the phenomenon of
uncompetitive inhibition, whereby the allosteric modulator

discussion
two-state models inevitably predict that allosteric modulators affect the observed efficacy of the agonist. this report
as well as those of others have generated a small list of
agonists (acetylcholine, s-aceclidine,  xxxd215xxx , bm5, carbachol, and oxotremorine-m) whose efficacy is unaffected by
 xxxd2174xxx . these results would appear to rule out two-state
models as the sole explanation for the allosteric effect of
 xxxd2174xxx .
an issue requiring careful consideration in a two-state
model relates to the maximal degree of receptor activation.
highly efficacious agonists that cause complete receptor activation, even in the presence of a negative modulator, would
only exhibit an allosteric modulation in affinity. when m2
muscarinic receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase
activity was measured in homogenates of the myocardium in
the presence of 0.1 mm gtp, the relative efficacy values of a
group of agonists all varied, with the values for oxotremorine-m, carbachol, s-aceclidine, and bm5 being 1.6, 1, 0.37,
and 0.087, respectively (ehlert, 1985). the lack of a clear
plateau value for the efficacy of the most efficacious agonists
suggests that none of the agonists causes maximal receptor
activation. this result is not surprising because the assays
were carried out in the presence of gtp (0.1 mm), which
greatly inhibits the proportion of the agonist-receptor complex in the active state (ehlert, 2000). it is possible that the
intracellular concentration of gtp is comparatively lower in
cho cells, which would enable agonists with lower efficacy
to generate more of the active receptor conformation. this
postulate is consistent with the moderate increase in the
observed affinity of oxotremorine-m observed in this study
(pkobs ⫽ 6.03) compared to that observed in myocardial homogenates in the presence of gtp (0.1 mm) (pkobs ⫽ 5.12)
(ehlert, 1987). the moderate increase in affinity indicates
that the corresponding increase in the proportion of occupied
receptor in the active conformation is also moderate, which
suggests that the agonist kb/ka ratios are not much greater
than those required for maximal receptor activation in the
cho cell. if the agonists were near the threshold for complete receptor activation, one would expect that  xxxd2174xxx 
would still cause a reduction in receptor activation at high

concentrations (10 –100 ␮m) if the two-state model were tenable. the result would be a greater  xxxd2174xxx -induced reduction in agonist potency for inhibiting camp accumulation
compared with that for observed binding affinity (ehlert,
2005) or an accompanying decline in emax. however, this
behavior was not observed, and the shift in the agonistconcentration-response curve was equivalent to the measured change in binding affinity. in addition, high concentrations of  xxxd2174xxx  (1– 0.1 mm) were without effect on the
emax of the partial agonist bm5 (ehlert, 1988b) or on the
emax of oxotremorine-m after a reduction in its emax by
partial receptor inactivation (fig. 5).
the simple two-state model predicts a correlation between
the cooperativity constant (␣) for a given allosteric-orthosteric ligand pair and the intrinsic efficacy of the orthosteric
ligand. in other words, the model predicts that the absolute
value of the log ␣ value would be greatest for efficacious
agonists, intermediate for agonists with low efficacy, and
zero for antagonists. it is interesting that it also predicts that
the product of the cooperativity constants for observed affinity (␣) and intrinsic efficacy (␤) is constant and equivalent to
the ratio of microscopic affinity constants of the modulator
for active and inactive states of the receptor (kf/ke). various
gabaa receptor subtypes exhibit this behavior with regard
to the allosteric interactions between gaba agonists and
benzodiazepine, barbiturates, and other allosteric modulators (ehlert et al., 1983; levitan et al., 1988; sigel and baur,
1988). in contrast,  xxxd2174xxx  exhibits substantial negative
cooperativity with both agonists and antagonists, which is
inconsistent with the simple two-state model (stockton et al.,
1983). the complex two-state model can explain this behavior; however, it cannot account for widespread modulation in
affinity only. in contrast, the tandem two-site, two-state allosteric model can account for the behavior of  xxxd2174xxx .
at the present time, we cannot rule out small allosteric
changes in the intrinsic efficacy of the agonist receptor complex by  xxxd2174xxx . the data of jakubı́k et al. (1996) showing
that occupancy of the allosteric site on m2 receptors by  xxxd2174xxx  actually elicits small agonistic effects (i.e., inhibition
in camp accumulation) suggest that a minor effect on efficacy may occur. within the context of the tandem two-site
model, the latter observation may imply that conformational
changes in the relay site and activation site is not completely
independent of each other.
there are several examples of other allosteric muscarinic
ligands that behave differently from  xxxd2174xxx , indicating
that not all allosteric interactions at the m2 muscarinic receptor can be explained by the tandem two-site, two-state
allosteric model as described here. for example, alcuronium
has been shown to modulate the intrinsic efficacy of pilocarpine (zahn et al., 2002), and the allosteric effects of strychnine on acetylcholine-stimulated guanosine 5⬘-o-(3-[35s]thio)triphosphate ([35s]gtp␥s) binding show a discrepancy
between the allosteric modulation of observed binding affinity and functional potency indicating allosteric changes in
agonist efficacy (lazareno and birdsall, 1995). it is generally
assumed that alcuronium acts at the same allosteric site as
 xxxd2174xxx , and it is conceivable that occupancy of the site by
alcuronium alters the unimolecular constants (kc, kd) of the
activation site, such that efficacy modulation occurs. furthermore, the compound ac-42 has been shown to activate
the m2 muscarinic receptor, and it appears to do so through

exhibits selectivity for the active state yet inhibits activity
when bound to it. for a ligand-gated ion channel, the mechanism of this inhibition could be an open channel block. for
a g protein-coupled receptor, the inhibitor could sterically
interfere with the receptor-g protein interaction.
it has also been argued that the extended ternary complex
model shows that the allosteric parameters are system-dependent whenever the orthosteric ligand exhibits selectivity
for ground or active conformations of the receptor (hall,
2000). for the simple two-state model, however, we show
that the product ␣␤ is equivalent to kf/ke provided that ki ⬍⬍
1 for negative modulators and that kf/ke ⬍⬍ 1/ki for positive
modulators. because it is always possible to estimate the
product of ␣␤ in functional studies (ehlert, 1988a, 2005), it
should be possible to measure the selectivity of the allosteric
modulator for ground and active states of the receptor (kf/ke)
for any system conforming to the simple two-state model. the
latter ratio is solely a property of the allosteric ligand-receptor complex.

binding to an allosteric site located on the extracellular loops
of the receptor (may et al., 2007). the muscarinic agonist
mcn-a-343 has also been suggested to act allosterically
(birdsall et al., 1983; may et al., 2007). if the mechanism
were allosteric, it would exhibit a high degree of negative
cooperativity with both nms and carbachol. in the case of
carbachol, the minimal estimate of the absolute value of the
logarithm of its ␣ value with carbachol would be approximately 3.0 in order to explain the data obtained by christopolous and michelson (1997). because mcn-a-343 activates
the  xxxg448xxx , it must discriminate between active and
inactive states. an allosteric mechanism would require these
conformations to be different from those utilized by carbachol; otherwise, the two agonists would exhibit positive
cooperativity.
models of the  xxxg448xxx  place the location of the allosteric site at the level of the outer membrane surface, whereas
the orthosteric site is thought to be deeper within the transmembrane domains (trankle et al., 2005). this topography
explains why  xxxd2174xxx  and other allosteric agents greatly
slow the binding kinetics of orthosteric ligands, because the
model predicts that the allosteric ligand may trap the orthosteric ligand when both types of ligands are occupying their
respective sites. jakubik et al. (2000) have suggested that the
putative relay site and activation site are in such close proximity that occupancy of both sites by two molecules of nms is
sterically hindered. if the putative relay site facilitates the
inward transfer of orthosteric ligands to the activation site, it
would seem that the relay site might be between the activation and allosteric sites. perhaps the conformational states of
the putative relay site function normally in the absence of
allosteric modulators to facilitate the inward transfer of agonist to the activation site.
it has been shown that the second extracellular loop (e2) of
the m2 muscarinic receptor has modest role in the binding of
 xxxd2174xxx  but a much greater role in the binding of other
modulators (leppik et al., 1994; gnagey et al., 1999; voigtländer et al., 2003). cysteine mutagenesis of residues val171
and asn419 caused a marked reduction in the affinity of
acetylcholine and only a moderate reduction in that of  xxxd2174xxx  (avlani et al., 2007). these effects were reversed by
treatment with dithiothreitol, suggesting that the changes in
affinity are caused by bending the e2 loop over the binding
pocket of the receptor through a disulfide bond linkage.
given that the e2 loop seems far from what is thought to be
the acetylcholine binding pocket, the results suggest that a
reduction in agonist affinity can be caused by reducing access
to the binding pocket by a greater net decrement relative to
egress (outward rectification). this “capping” mechanism is
reminiscent of the slowing in the kinetics of [3h]nms binding caused by  xxxd2174xxx  (stockton et al., 1983). it is conceivable that the postulated allosteric effect of  xxxd2174xxx  on the
putative relay site may cause a relative outward rectification
of access to the agonist binding pocket similar to that caused
by modification of the e2 loop.
our models are straightforward extensions of the original
ideas put forth by monod et al. (1965) and koshland et al.
(1966) and have widespread application to the analysis of
allosterism at other receptors. a better understanding of the
origin of cooperativity and the interdependence of allosteric
changes in affinity and efficacy should help in the identifica-

in this equation, f denotes the fractional binding of
[3h]nms at a fixed concentration measured in the presence
of various concentrations of agonist and a fixed concentration
of  xxxd2174xxx  divided by that measured in the absence of
agonist. substituting in eqs. 72 and 73 for kobs and kobs⬘
followed by rearrangement yields:

f⫽

d共k1⫺d ⫹ a␣ xxxd1482xxx ⫺dk2兲
1⫹
1 ⫹  xxxg108xxx  ⫹ l共k1⫺nms ⫹ a␣nmsk1⫺dk2兲

(75)

when d is present at a concentration causing 50% displacement specific [3h]nms binding, eq. 75 becomes:

1
⫽

1
ic50⬘共k1⫺d ⫹ a␣ xxxd1482xxx ⫺dk2兲

ic50⬘ ⫽

1 ⫹  xxxg108xxx  ⫹ l共k1⫺nms ⫹ a␣nmsk1⫺nmsk2兲
k1⫺d ⫹ a␣ xxxd1482xxx ⫺dk2

(77)

equation 77 can be used to describe the ic50 value of the
agonist in the absence of  xxxd2174xxx  by setting a ⫽ 0. under
this condition, eq. 77 reduces to:

ic50 ⫽

1 ⫹ lk1⫺nms
k1⫺d

(78)

equation 78 is equivalent to that described by cheng and
prussoff (1973), with the dissociation constants replaced with
affinity constants. the shift in the agonist/[3h]nms competition curves caused by  xxxd2174xxx  can be derived by taking
the ratio of the ic50 value of the agonist measured in the
presence of  xxxd2174xxx  divided by that measured in its absence (r):

r⫽

ic50⬘
ic50

(79)

substituting in eqs. 77 and 78 for ic50⬘ and ic50 followed
by rearrangement yields:

r⫽

1 ⫹  xxxg108xxx  ⫹ l共k1⫺nms ⫹ a␣nmsk1⫺nmsk2兲
1 ⫹ lk1⫺nms ⫹ a␣dk2 ⫹ al␣ xxxd1482xxx ⫺nmsk2

(80)

solving this equation for ␣d yields eq. 7 (see materials and
methods).
