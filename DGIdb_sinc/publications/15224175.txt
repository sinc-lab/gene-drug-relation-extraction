abstract it has previously been suggested that ergotamine produces external carotid vasoconstriction in vagosympathectomised dogs via 5-ht1b/1d receptors and alpha2adrenoceptors. the present study has reanalysed this
suggestion by using more selective antagonists alone and
in combination. fifty-two anaesthetised dogs were prepared for ultrasonic measurements of external carotid
blood flow. the animals were divided into thirteen groups
(n=4 each) receiving an i.v. bolus injection of, either
physiological saline (0.3 ml/kg; control), or the antagonists
sb224289 (300 mug/kg; 5-ht1b), brl15572 (300 µg/kg;
 xxxg1110xxx ), rauwolscine (300 µg/kg;  xxxg831xxx ), sb224289 +
brl15572 (300 µg/kg each), sb224289 + rauwolscine
(300 µg/kg each), brl15572 + rauwolscine (300 µg/kg
each), rauwolscine (300 µg/kg) +  xxxd3000xxx  (100 µg/kg;
alpha1), sb224289 (300 µg/kg) +  xxxd3000xxx  (100 µg/kg),
sb224289 (300 µg/kg) + rauwolscine (300 µg/kg) +
 xxxd3000xxx  (100 µg/kg), sb224289 (300 µg/kg) +  xxxd3000xxx 
(100 µg/kg) + brl44408 (1,000 µg/kg; alpha2a), sb224289
(300 µg/kg) +  xxxd3000xxx  (100 µg/kg)+ imiloxan (1,000 µg/
kg; alpha2b), or sb224289 (300 µg/kg) +  xxxd3000xxx  (100 µg/
kg) + mk912 (300 µg/kg; alpha2c). each group received
consecutive 1-min intracarotid infusions of ergotamine
(0.56, 1, 1.8, 3.1, 5.6, 10 and 18 µg/min), following a
cumulative schedule. in saline-pretreated animals, ergotamine induced dose-dependent decreases in external
carotid blood flow without affecting arterial blood pressure or heart rate. these control responses were:

ergotamine in dogs is predominantly mediated by 5-ht1b

introduction
vasodilatation of cranial large arteries and arteriovenous
anastomoses has been proposed to play an important role
in the pathophysiology of migraine headache (villalón et
al. 2002). in this sense, the effective  xxxd2022xxx  agents
sumatriptan and the ergots (ergotamine and dihydroergotamine) produce potent and selective carotid vasoconstriction in models predictive for  xxxd2022xxx  activity in pigs
(de vries et al. 1998b; den boer et al. 1991), rabbits (de
vries et al. 1997) and dogs (de vries et al. 1998a; villalón
et al. 1999). interestingly, while the carotid vasoconstriction to sumatriptan is mediated exclusively by 5-ht1b
receptors (de vries et al.1998a, 1998b, 1999; saxena and
tfelt-hansen 2000), that to ergotamine and dihydroergotamine is more complex and seems to involve mainly 5ht1b/1d receptors and  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors (villalón et al.
1999). indeed, the canine carotid vasoconstrictor responses to ergotamine and dihydroergotamine were:
1. partly antagonised by either gr127935 (30 µg/kg) or
yohimbine (100 µg/kg)
2. completely antagonised by the combination of both
antagonists

47

3. apparently resistant to antagonism by  xxxd3000xxx 
(300 µg/kg)
this may be explained in terms that:
1. gr127935 displays high, moderate and lower affinities for, respectively, 5-ht1b/1d, 5-ht2 and alpha1/2adrenoceptors (skingle et al. 1996)
2. yohimbine displays moderate affinities for 5-ht1b/1d,
5-ht2, alpha1/2-adrenoceptors and others (hoyer 1988;
leysen and gommeren 1984)
3.  xxxd3000xxx  is very selective for alpha1-adrenoceptors (for
references see bylund et al. 1994)
more recently, it has been shown that both alpha1- and alpha2adrenoceptors are operative in the canine external carotid
circulation mediating vasoconstrictor responses (willems
et al. 2001a); these receptors display a pharmacological
correlation with the alpha1a, alpha1d, alpha2a and alpha2c subtypes
(willems et al. 2001c).
in the light of the above findings, the present study,
which analyses the canine external carotid vasoconstriction to ergotamine, was designed to:
1. further identify the specific subtypes of 5-ht1b/1d (5ht1b or  xxxg1110xxx ) receptors as well as  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors (alpha2a, alpha2b or alpha2c)
2. reconsider the possible role of alpha1-adrenoceptors

materials and methods
general experiments were carried out in a total of 52 male mongrel
dogs (25–30 kg) that were anaesthetised with an i.v. injection of
sodium pentobarbitone (30 mg/kg) and additional amounts (1 mg/
kg, i.v.) provided every 45 min to maintain the anaesthesia
throughout the experiment. all dogs were intubated with an
endotracheal tube and artificially respired with room air using a
palmer ventilation pump (20 strokes/min; stroke volume of 13–
16 ml/kg; see kleinman and radford, 1964). catheters were placed
in a femoral vein for the administration of antagonists and in a
femoral artery, connected to a statham pressure transducer (p23 id),
for measurement of arterial blood pressure. after administration of
vehicle or antagonists, the venous catheter was flushed with 3 ml of
saline. mean arterial blood pressure (map) was calculated from the
systolic (sap) and diastolic (dap) arterial pressures: map=dap
+(sap−dap)/3. heart rate was measured with a tachograph (7p4f,
grass instrument co., quincy, ma, usa) triggered from the arterial
blood pressure signals.
the common carotid artery was dissected free and the corresponding
internal carotid and occipital arteries were ligated. bilateral cervical
vagosympathectomy was systematically performed in order to:
1. produce one of the main features of migraine, namely, external
carotid vasodilatation (saxena and de vlaam-schluter 1974)
2. prevent possible baroreceptor reflexes produced by ergotamine
thereafter, an ultrasonic flow probe (4 mm r-series) connected
to an ultrasonic t206 flowmeter (transonic systems inc., ithaca,
ny, usa) was placed around the common carotid artery and the
flow through this artery was considered as the external carotid blood
flow (villalón et al. 1993). after i.v. administration of the respective
pretreatments, ergotamine was administered (1 ml/min, during
1 min) into the carotid artery by a wpi model sp100i pump (world
precision instruments inc., sarasota, fl, usa) with a catheter
inserted into the cranial thyroid artery. arterial blood pressure, heart

rate and external carotid blood flow were recorded simultaneously
by a model 7d polygraph (grass instrument co., quincy, ma,
usa). the body temperature of the animals was maintained
between 37–38°c.
experimental protocol once the animals had been in a stable
haemodynamic condition for at least 60 min, baseline values of
mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate and external carotid blood
flow were determined. then, the animals were divided into 13
groups (n=4 each) which received i.v. bolus injections of:
1. either physiological saline (0.3 ml/kg; control), or the
antagonists:
2. sb224289 (300 µg/kg; 5-ht1b)
3. brl15572 (300 µg/kg;  xxxg1110xxx )
4. rauwolscine (300 µg/kg;  xxxg831xxx )
5. sb224289 + brl15572 (300 µg/kg each)
6. sb224289 + rauwolscine (300 µg/kg each)
7. brl15572 + rauwolscine (300 µg/kg each)
8. rauwolscine (300 µg/kg) +  xxxd3000xxx  (100 µg/kg; alpha1)
9. sb224289 (300 µg/kg) +  xxxd3000xxx  (100 µg/kg)
10. sb224289 (300 µg/kg) + rauwolscine (300 µg/kg) +  xxxd3000xxx 
(100 µg/kg)
11. sb224289 (300 µg/kg) +  xxxd3000xxx  (100 µg/kg) + brl44408
(1,000 µg/kg; alpha2a)
12. sb224289 (300 µg/kg) +  xxxd3000xxx  (100 µg/kg) + imiloxan
(1,000 µg/kg; alpha2b)
13. sb224289 (300 µg/kg) +  xxxd3000xxx  (100 µg/kg) + mk912
(300 µg/kg; alpha2c)
after 15 min (except in the case of brl44408, where 25 min
were allowed to elapse for the recovery of haemodynamic variables;
see results section), the effect of cumulative intracarotid (i.c.)
infusions (1 ml/min; during 1 min) of ergotamine (0.56, 1, 1.8, 3.1,
5.6, 10 and 18 µg/min; given every 5 min) on the systemic and
external carotid haemodynamic variables were determined in each
group.
drugs apart from sodium pentobarbitone, the compounds used in
this study were:  xxxd2022xxx  (gift: novartis, basel, switzerland); sb224289 and brl15572 (both gifts from smithkline
beecham pharmaceuticals, harlow, essex, uk);  xxxd3001xxx  and rauwolscine hydrochloride (both purchased from
research biochemicals int., natick, ma, usa); brl44408 (gift
from servier, suresnes, france); imiloxan hydrochloride (gift from
roche bioscience, palo alto, ca, usa); and mk912 (gift from
merck & co., nj, usa). the compounds were dissolved in saline
except ergotamine, sb224289, brl15572 and brl44408, which
were dissolved in 20% v/v  xxxd3034xxx . this vehicle had no
effect (when given i.v. or i.c.) on the systemic and carotid
haemodynamic variables (not shown). the doses of all compounds
refer to their free base. the protocol of this investigation was
approved by the ethical committee of cinvestav-ipn dealing
with the use of animals in scientific experiments.
data presentation and statistical analysis all data in the text and
figures are presented as mean ± sem. the peak changes in external
carotid blood flow (calculated as percent change from baseline)
produced by the i.c. infusions of ergotamine in the antagonistpretreated animals were determined and compared to the respective
responses to ergotamine in the saline-pretreated animals by studentnewman-keuls’ test, once a two-way repeated measures analysis of
variance (randomised block design) had revealed that the samples
represented different populations (steel and torrie 1980). statistical
significance was accepted at p<0.05 (two-tailed).

results
systemic and carotid haemodynamic variables
baseline values of heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure
and external carotid blood flow in the 52 anaesthetised
dogs were: 149±5 beats/min, 132±3 mmhg and 146
±10 ml/min, respectively. after i.v. administration of
saline or the antagonists sb224289, brl15572, rauwolscine, imiloxan or mk912, given alone or in the different
combinations, the systemic and carotid haemodynamic
values remained unchanged, except for a slight (though
significant) hypotensive response (13±5%) after  xxxd3000xxx .
moreover, immediately after its administration,
brl44408 (1,000 µg/kg) increased mean arterial blood
pressure (35±10%) and decreased the external carotid
blood flow (−44±4%). these effects, which were not
accompanied by changes in heart rate, returned to baseline
values after 25 min.
effect of the different treatments on the external
carotid vasoconstriction to ergotamine
in animals pretreated with saline (control), ergotamine
produced dose-dependent decreases in external carotid
blood flow (maximal response: −53±9%; fig. 1). since
heart rate and blood pressure remained unchanged (not
shown), these decreases in blood flow were qualitatively
and quantitatively similar to their corresponding vascular
conductances (not shown) and, therefore, an active
vasoconstriction is implied. the responses to ergotamine
remained:
1. unaffected by sb224289 (fig. 1a), brl15572
(fig. 1b) or rauwolscine (fig. 1c; 300 µg/kg each)
2. also unaltered by the combinations of sb224289 +
brl15572 (fig. 2a), brl15572 + rauwolscine
(fig. 2c), rauwolscine +  xxxd3000xxx  (100 µg/kg)
fig. 1 effect of i.v. administration of: a sb224289 (sb;
300 µg/kg), b brl15572 (brl;
300 µg/kg) or c rauwolscine
(rauw; 300 µg/kg; n=4 for each
group) on the decreases in external carotid blood flow induced by cumulative 1-min intracarotid (i.c.) infusions of ergotamine

(fig. 2d) or sb224289 +  xxxd3000xxx  (fig. 2e), but
were partly blocked by the combination of sb224289
+ rauwolscine (fig. 2b)
interestingly, the blockade exerted by the combination
sb224289 + rauwolscine +  xxxd3000xxx  was significantly
more pronounced, at least for the 10 and 18 µg/min of
ergotamine, as compared to that elicited by sb224289 +
rauwolscine (fig. 2f). hence, we decided to identify the
involvement of specific  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha2a,
alpha2b, alpha2c) in the responses to ergotamine by testing the  xxxg831xxx 
subtype-selective antagonists, brl44408 (alpha2a), imiloxan
(alpha2b) or mk912 (alpha2c) in dogs pretreated with the
antagonists sb224289 (300 µg/kg; 5-ht1b) and  xxxd3000xxx 
(100 µg/kg; alpha1). the responses to ergotamine remained
unchanged in the animals pretreated with the combinations
of sb224289 +  xxxd3000xxx  + imiloxan (1,000 µg/kg)
(fig. 3b), but were markedly blocked in those pretreated
with the combinations of sb224289 +  xxxd3000xxx  +
brl44408 (1,000 µg/kg) (fig. 3a) or sb224289 +
 xxxd3000xxx  + mk912 (300 µg/kg) (fig. 3c). it must be
emphasised that, in addition to considering binding
affinity values, the doses of all antagonists used in this
study were, at least, 0.5 log units higher than those
required to completely antagonise the canine external
carotid vasoconstrictor responses induced by their respective receptor agonists (e.g. phenylephryne/ xxxd2601xxx ,
bht9333 and sumatriptan; see terrón et al. 1996; de
vries et al. 1998a; willems et al. 2001a, 2001c).
moreover, the blockade produced by the above doses of
antagonists was selective as they failed to block the
external carotid vasoconstrictor responses to other agonists
stimulating different receptor families (see terrón et al.
1996; de vries et al. 1998a; willems et al. 2001a, 2001c).

discussion
systemic and carotid haemodynamic changes
the lack of effect of saline in the present study:
1. confirms the reproducibility of our experimental
conditions
2. is consistent with previous findings (willems et al.
2001b), in which treatment of the dogs with 0.3 ml/kg
of saline, given i.c. or i.v., does not cause any changes
in the systemic or carotid haemodynamic variables
moreover, the hypotension to  xxxd3000xxx  can be explained
by blockade of alpha1-adrenoceptors that regulate vascular
tone and, therefore, arterial blood pressure (vargas and
gorman 1995). in contrast, the hypertension and external
carotid vasoconstriction observed after brl44408, which
returned to baseline values after 25 min, could be
explained by activation of vascular alpha1-adrenoceptors, as
reported in anaesthetised rats (vayssettes-courchay et al.
1996).
contribution of 5-ht1b receptors and alpha1/alpha2adrenoceptors in the ergotamine-induced
vasoconstrictor responses
although ergotamine displays high affinities for alpha1/alpha2adrenoceptors, 5-ht1b/1d, 5-ht2 and other receptors and
may even activate unknown mechanisms (hoyer 1988;
tfelt-hansen et al. 2000), we have previously suggested
that the external carotid vasoconstriction to ergotamine
involves 5-ht1b/1d receptors and  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors on the
basis of the blockade produced by gr127935 and
yohimbine (see introduction; villalón et al. 1999).
admittedly, the latter antagonists may also be blocking
the unknown mechanisms activated by ergotamine (hoyer
1988; tfelt-hansen et al. 2000), although this has not been
categorically proven. the above findings, coupled to the
advent of more selective ligands at the different subtypes
of 5-ht1b/1d receptors and  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors (see below),
led us to carry out a more detailed pharmacological
analysis. in principle, we re-evaluated the involvement of
5-ht1b/ xxxg1110xxx  receptors and alpha1/ xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors in the
responses to ergotamine (as previously reported for
dihydroergotamine; villalón et al. 2004) by testing the
effects of the selective antagonists sb224289 (5-ht1b;
hagan et al. 1997), brl15572 ( xxxg1110xxx ; price et al. 1997)
or rauwolscine ( xxxg831xxx ; hieble et al. 1995) given alone or in
combination. surprisingly, sb224289 (alone or in combination with brl15572) or rauwolscine (300 µg/kg each),
which partly blocked the vasoconstriction to dihydroergotamine (villalón et al. 2004), failed to block that to
ergotamine. the most likely explanations for this finding
include that:
1. the above antagonists are much more selective than
gr127935 and yohimbine for respectively, 5-ht1b
(gaster et al. 1998),  xxxg1110xxx  (hagan et al. 1997; price

et al. 1997) and  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors (bylund et al. 1994;
hieble et al. 1995)
2. ergotamine, as previously discussed, can activate
additional “novel” mechanisms unrelated to the above
receptors
in view that the doses of sb224289, brl15572 or
rauwolscine (and also  xxxd3000xxx ; villalón et al. 1999) were,
at least, 0.5 log units higher than those required to
completely block their respective receptors (see results
section), the simplest interpretation of these findings
would apparently suggest that 5-ht1b/ xxxg1110xxx  and
alpha1/ xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors may not be involved, despite the
fact that ergotamine displays high affinity for these
receptors (see above). notwithstanding, if as previously
implied, 5-ht1b/1d and  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors are partly
involved in the response to ergotamine (villalón et al.
1999), one would expect (after excluding  xxxg1110xxx 
receptors with brl15572) that the combination of
sb224289 and rauwolscine should have produced a
marked (rather than a partial) blockade, as shown with
dihydroergotamine (villalón et al. 2004). this indicates
that additional mechanisms may play a role; one of these
mechanisms could involve, to a lesser extent, alpha1adrenoceptors since the combination of sb224289,
rauwolscine and  xxxd3000xxx  produced a further blockade
(see fig. 2f). the remaining response (approximately
15%) after this combination might be attributable to
unknown receptors/mechanisms.
the above results lead us to propose that the apparent
lack of antagonism by sb224289, brl15572, rauwolscine or  xxxd3000xxx , when given alone, may be due to the
agonist actions of ergotamine at 5-ht1b receptors and alpha2adrenoceptors (fig. 2b) and, to a lesser extent, alpha1adrenoceptors (fig. 2f). hence, this action of ergotamine
may have overshadowed the antagonism of 5-ht1b
receptors with sb224289. a similar line of reasoning
may apply to the antagonism of  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors with
rauwolscine (fig. 1) or of alpha1-adrenoceptors with  xxxd3000xxx 
(villalón et al. 1999). this allows us to hypothesise that if
the external carotid vasoconstriction to ergotamine
involves the stimulation of three (or even more) receptors,
the antagonism of at least 5-ht1b receptors and alpha2adrenoceptors (fig. 2b), which seem to predominate over
alpha1-adrenoceptors (fig. 2f), would be mandatory to
produce a significant blockade. this hypothesis may also
explain why the combinations of sb224289 + brl15572,
brl15572 + rauwolscine, rauwolscine +  xxxd3000xxx  or
sb224289 +  xxxd3000xxx  (fig. 2) were ineffective.
interestingly, rauwolscine has nanomolar affinity for 5ht2b receptors (wainscott et al. 1998). since these
receptors may mediate ergotamine-induced vasorelaxation
in the porcine pulmonary artery (glusa and roos 1996), it
could be argued that rauwolscine may antagonise 5-ht2b
receptor-mediated external carotid vasodilator responses,
which could physiologically oppose ergotamine-induced
vasoconstriction. however, bw723c86, a selective 5ht2b receptor agonist (baxter 1996), failed to produce

51

external carotid vasodilatation in doses up to 1,000 µg/min
given i.c. (unpublished observations).
moreover, the lack of antagonism by brl15572, given
alone (fig. 1b) or in combination with sb224289
(fig. 2a), rauwolscine (fig. 2c) or  xxxd3000xxx  (not
shown), rules out the involvement of  xxxg1110xxx  receptors.
this view is reinforced by the fact that pnu-142633, a
selective  xxxg1110xxx  receptor agonist (ennis et al. 1998), did
not produce external carotid vasoconstriction nor did it
antagonise the vasoconstrictor responses to sumatriptan
(villalón et al. 2001).
clearly, the above findings emphasise the importance of
analysing the effect of combinations of selective antagonists, particularly when only one of them is apparently
inactive to block a given response to an agonist.

rauwolscine did (willems et al. 2001c). since, in the
presence of sb224289 and  xxxd3000xxx , rauwolscine produced a similar blockade (fig. 2f) to that produced by
brl44408 (fig. 3a) or mk912 (fig. 3c), we considered
it unnecessary to test the combination of brl44408 and
mk912 in dogs pretreated with sb224289 +  xxxd3000xxx .
these findings, in addition to reconfirming the presence of
the alpha2a and/or alpha2c subtypes in the canine external carotid
circulation (willems et al. 2001c), further reveal that, like
ergotamine (present study), dihydroergotamine (villalón et
al. 2004) and  xxxd2395xxx  (willems et al. 2001b) also
activate the alpha2a and/or alpha2c subtypes.

involvement of alpha2a/2c-adrenoceptor subtypes

it has recently been shown that the canine external carotid
vasoconstriction to dihydroergotamine is mainly mediated
by 5-ht1b receptors and alpha2a/2c-adrenoceptors (villalón et
al. 2004), but not by alpha1-adrenoceptors (villalón et al.
1999) as this response was:

in view of the involvement of rauwolscine-sensitive alpha2adrenoceptors, revealed in combination with sb224289
(fig. 2b) or with sb224289 +  xxxd3000xxx  (fig. 2f), in the
responses to ergotamine, we further identified the specific
subtypes of  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors involved using the antagonists brl44408 (1,000 µg/kg; alpha2a), imiloxan (1,000 µg/
kg; alpha2b) and mk912 (300 µg/kg; alpha2c) in doses high
enough to block their respective subtypes (willems et al.
2001c) under systematic blockade of 5-ht1b receptors
and alpha1-adrenoceptors with, respectively, sb224289
(300 µg/kg, displaying a pki value <6.0 for the different
alpha1 and  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor subtypes; gaster et al. 1998) and
 xxxd3000xxx  (100 µg/kg, displaying a pki value around 10 for
the different alpha1-adrenoceptor subtypes, and a pki value
around 7 for the different  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor subtypes;
bylund et al. 1994). it is noteworthy that brl44408,
imiloxan and mk912 were not tested by themselves in
view that rauwolscine (which displays very high affinities
for alpha2a-, alpha2b- and alpha2c-adrenoceptors; bylund et al. 1994)
did not block, when given alone, the vasoconstrictor
response to ergotamine (see fig. 1c). in the presence of
sb224289 and  xxxd3000xxx , the responses to ergotamine
were:
1. resistant to blockade by imiloxan, which suggests that
alpha2b-adrenoceptors are not involved
2. markedly antagonised by brl44408 or mk912, a
finding which may imply the involvement of the
alpha2a/2c subtypes
admittedly, no information is available on the relative
selectivity of these drugs at canine  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor
subtypes. in fact, the in vitro alpha2a- versus alpha2c-selectivity
of brl44408 and mk912 is small (devedjian et al.
1994), leaving very little, if any, room for in vivo
selectivity. hence, to be precise, our findings support an
involvement of alpha2a- and/or alpha2c-adrenoceptor subtypes. in
fact, the combination of the same doses of the alpha2a
(brl44408)- and alpha2c (mk912)-adrenoceptor antagonists
abolished the bht933 ( xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor agonist)-induced
external carotid vasoconstriction in a similar manner as

does the pharmacological profile of ergotamine differ
from that of dihydroergotamine?

1. partly blocked by sb224289 (300 µg/kg) or rauwolscine (300 µg/kg)
2. resistant to blockade by brl15572 or  xxxd3000xxx 
(300 µg/kg each) given alone
3. markedly blocked by the combination of sb224289 +
rauwolscine
in an attempt to further re-evaluate the possible
contribution of alpha1-adrenoceptors in these responses to
dihydroergotamine, we analysed the effects of the
combination of sb224289 (300 µg/kg) + rauwolscine
(300 µg/kg) +  xxxd3000xxx  (100 µg/kg); since the blockade
produced by this combination did not differ from that of
sb224289 + rauwolscine (unlike ergotamine) reconfirms
that, under our experimental conditions, alpha1-adrenoceptors
are not involved in the responses to dihydroergotamine
(unpublished).
in contrast with dihydroergotamine, the present study
analysing ergotamine clearly shows that the blockade
produced by the combination of sb224289 (300 µg/kg) +
rauwolscine (300 µg/kg) +  xxxd3000xxx  (100 µg/kg) produced
a more pronounced blockade when compared to that of
sb224289 + rauwolscine (fig. 2f). this finding supports
the involvement of alpha1-adrenoceptors. however, such an
involvement seems to be rather small in view that the
blockade produced by the combination of antagonists was
either undetectable (sb224289 +  xxxd3000xxx ) or incomplete
(sb224289 + rauwolscine +  xxxd3000xxx ). for this reason, we
decided not to determine the specific subtypes of alpha1adrenoceptors (alpha1a, alpha1b and/or alpha1d) involved in this
response, although previous studies in the canine external
circulation have revealed the presence of the alpha1a and alpha1d,
but not of the alpha1b, subtypes (willems et al. 2001c).
evidently, the pharmacological nature of the vasoconstrictor responses to ergotamine is more complex than that
of dihydroergotamine. the remaining response to ergotamine after antagonist combinations (figs. 2f, 3a, 3c)

could be attributable to unknown receptors/mechanisms,
the investigation of which would require further studies
falling beyond the scope of this investigation.
possible implications of the involvement of 5-ht1b
receptors and alpha2a/2c-adrenoceptors
our findings showing a functional coexistence of 5-ht1b
receptors and alpha2a/2c-adrenoceptors mediating the external
carotid vasoconstriction to ergotamine could explain its
 xxxd2022xxx  efficacy. however, in contrast to the success
of triptans in migraine therapy (producing vasoconstriction
via 5-ht1b receptors; saxena and tfelt-hansen 2000;
villalón et al. 2002), further evidence is required to
suggest the possible clinical relevance of potent and
selective agonists at alpha2a- and/or alpha2c-adrenoceptor subtypes.
in conclusion, our results show that the cranio-selective
vasoconstriction to ergotamine in dogs is predominantly
mediated by 5-ht1b receptors as well as alpha2a/2c-adrenoceptor subtypes and, to a lesser extent, by alpha1-adrenoceptors.
