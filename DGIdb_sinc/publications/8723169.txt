summary. in this study, we characterized the interactions

of  xxxd212xxx , a novel catecholamine developed for use as a
cardiac stress testing agent, with different adrenergic receptor subtypes in vitro. these effects were compared with those
of  xxxd2401xxx . in the electrically stimulated left atria of
rats,  xxxd212xxx  increased contractile force. the pd2 values
( - l o g of the dose that produces 50% of the maximal responses) for  xxxd212xxx  and  xxxd2401xxx  were 8.45 -+ 0.15
and 8.55 -+ 0.02, respectively. metoprolol shifted the concentration-effect curves for both  xxxd2401xxx  and  xxxd212xxx 
to the right with a pa2 value ( - l o g of the dose of the antagonist that reduces the maximal responses of an agonist to 50%)
of 7.22-7.5. both  xxxd212xxx  and  xxxd2401xxx  increased the
rate of spontaneously beating rat right atria with pd2 values
of 9.0 -+ 0.19 and 8.82 -+ 0.18, respectively. the affinity constants (ka) of  xxxd212xxx  and  xxxd2401xxx  for cardiac betaladrenergic receptors, as determined by competition binding
assays, were found to be 7.32 and 6.04, respectively. in guinea
pig trachea,  xxxd212xxx  and  xxxd2401xxx  produced a concentration-dependent relaxation that was blocked by propranolol. their pd2 values were 7.9 +- 0.1 and 8.2 - 0.1,
respectively.  xxxd212xxx  contracted isolated rat aortic rings
with a maximal increase of 38.1 - 6.7% that of 10 ~tm of
norepinephrine. in rat white adipocytes,  xxxd212xxx ,  xxxd2401xxx , and brl-37344 stimulated glycerol release, with the
order of potency being brl-37344 >  xxxd212xxx  >  xxxd2401xxx . in hamster brown adipocytes, the order was  xxxd212xxx 
> i s o p r o t e r e n o l > brl-37344. moreover,  xxxd212xxx  stimulated  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptors in guinea pig ileum. in conclusion,  xxxd212xxx  is a novel catecholamine with similar
potency and efficacy to that of  xxxd2401xxx . it stimulates
cardiac  xxxg836xxx -, tracheal betas-, and adiopocyte beta~adrenergic receptors.  xxxd212xxx  does not stimulate alphaadrenergic receptors at concentrations that were high
enough to maximally activate the beta-adrenergic receptors.

useful data requires that a level of exercise be
achieved that increases myocardial oxygen demand
substantially [1]. unfortunately, m a n y patients are

physically unable to maintain sufficient vigorous exercise. consequently, pharmacological interventions using coronary vasodilators, such as  xxxd1914xxx , or
positive inotropic agents, such as  xxxd2401xxx  or dobutamine, have been used as alternatives to exercise
[2,3]. however,  xxxd1914xxx  can cause severe hypotension. additionally, the use of  xxxd2401xxx  is commonly associated with serious arrhythmias [4,5], and
dobutamine is more effective in increasing cardiac
contractility than heart rate [6,7].
 xxxd212xxx , r-l-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-[4-(4-hydroxyphenyl) butylamino] ethanol (figure 1) is a
novel catecholamine developed for pharmacological
cardiac stress testing [8,9].  xxxd212xxx  has relatively
g r e a t e r chronotropic effects than dobutamine and elicits less hypotension than  xxxd2401xxx  [10]. this is
consistent with the possibility that the profile of  xxxd212xxx 's effects at adrenergic receptors differs from
that of  xxxd2401xxx  and dobutamine. dobutamine
stimulates both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors,
while  xxxd2401xxx  is only capable of stimulating the
beta-subtype. in the present study, the interactions
of  xxxd212xxx  with different adrenergic receptors in
various isolated tissues were characterized and compared with  xxxd2401xxx .

gassed with 5% c02 in 02. the bath temperature was
maintained at 37°c (except in experiments using ra~
atria, in which it was 32°c). the bathing solution contained 10-5 m  xxxd2914xxx  (except in experiments of
rat aorta) to block alpha-adrenergic receptors and 3
× 10 -6 m cocaine and 10 -s m corticosterone to inhibit
both the neuronal and extraneuronal uptake mechanisms of the catecholamines, respectively. the tissues
were attached to an isometric transducer (grass ft03) from which tension recordings were obtained as
displayed on a beckman r-6011 dynograph, and were
allowed to equilibrate under appropriate resting tension for 90 minutes. cumulative concentration-effect
curves were constructed for each agonist [11]. the
time interval between successive additions of the agonists was adjusted to allow the steady-state response
to develop. after completion of the concentrationeffect curve, the drug was washed from the preparation at regular intervals. consecutive concentrationeffect curves were always determined at least 1 hour
apart to ensure maximum washout of agonists and to
minimize receptor desensitization.
rat atrial preparation. in a series of experiments,
the left atria of rats were removed and suspended
under an initial resting tension of 0.5 g. the tissues
were bathed in a modified chenweth-koelle solution,
the composition of which was (in mm):  xxxg2020xxx , 120; kc1,
5.6; cac12, 2.2; mgc12.6h20, 2.1; edta, 1.9;
nahc03, 19; and dextrose 10. the atria were stimulated electrically with square wave pulses of 5 msec
duration using a grass 3s stimulator at a voltage of
approximately double threshold. stimuli at a rate of 3
hz were delivered via two platinum electrodes placed
adjacent to the atrial tissues. concentration-effect
curves were constructed for  xxxd212xxx  and  xxxd2401xxx , both in the absence and presence of 10 -7, 3
× 10 -7 and 10 -6 m metoprolol. metoprolol was allowed to act for 20 minutes before adding the agonist.
in a second series, beating paired atria were used.
the tissues were treated as above. rate recordings
from the spontaneously beating right atrium were calculated directly from the tension signal at constant
chart speed. concentration-effect curves were constructed for each agonist as described earlier.

guinea pig trachea. tracheal strips were mounted
in tissue baths containing krebs-henseleit solution
(composition in mm:  xxxg2020xxx , 117.6; kc1, 5.36;
nah2pq, 1.01; glucose, 11.1; mgs04, 0.689; cacl2,
2.32, and nahc03, 25). the strips were stretched to
a resting tension of 2 g. the tissues were contracted
with 100 ~m of histamine, and the relaxation responses to  xxxd212xxx  and  xxxd2401xxx  were then
measured. the concentration-effect curves to  xxxd212xxx  and  xxxd2401xxx  were constructed again in
the presence of 1 ~m propranolol.
rat aorta. the thoracic aorta of male spraguedawley rats was cut into rings and mounted in tissue
baths containing krebs solution. a tension of 2 g was
applied to each ring. propranolol (1 ixm) was present
in the solution throughout the experiment. cumulative concentration-effect curves of norepinephrine,  xxxd212xxx , and  xxxd2401xxx  were constructed. a submaximal dose of each agonist was tested in the
presence of 1 ~m  xxxd2914xxx .
guinea pig ileum. segments from the terminal portion of guinea pig ileum were suspended under a resting tension of 0.7 g, in krebs solution (composition in
mm:  xxxg2020xxx , 118; cac12, 2.6; kc1, 4.9; nahc03, 25;
nah2p04, 1;  xxxd2534xxx , 1.2; and glucose, 11.7). the solution also contained 0.2 p.m choline. all guinea pigs
were pretreated with reserpine (5 mg/kg ip 18 hours
before use) to deplete endogenous stores of catecholamines. the intramural cholinergic nerves were stimulated electrically with supramaximal square pulses,
1 ms in duration, at a frequency of 0.1 hz using grass
stimulators connected to platinum electrodes placed
on either side of the ileum. concentration-effect
curves were constructed for  xxxd212xxx  and  xxxd2401xxx  in the absence and presence of 10 -6, 10 -5,
10 -4, and 3 × 10 -4 m  xxxd2689xxx .  xxxd2689xxx  was allowed to
act for 20 minutes before adding the agonist.
beta.adrenergic receptor binding
hearts from rats were cut into small pieces and homogenized and processed as described earlier [12].
cgp-26505 [5-phenoxy-~h] was used as the radiolabe1 ligand for betal-adrenergic receptors [13]. three

adrenergic activities of  xxxd212xxx 

nanomoles of cgp-26505 [5-phenoxy-3h] and an increasing concentration of an agonist were incubated
with 100 ~l of membrane suspension in a final volume
of 1 ml of buffer composed of tris hc1, 50 mm; dl,
dithiothreitol, 1 nm; and mgc12, 2 mm (ph 7.4). nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10
}~m ( - )propranolol. after 1 hour, incubation was terminated by the addition of 2 ml of ice-cold washing
buffer with the following composition: tris hc1, 25
mm;  xxxg2020xxx , 100 mm; and  xxxd2534xxx , 25 mm at ph 8.
the bound and free activities were separated by rapid
vacuum filtration through gf/c glass fiber filters
(whatman, clifton, n j) using a m-24xr brandel filter
(biomedical research and development laboratories,
usa). the radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter (beckman, ls 5000 td, usa).

lipolysis experiments
rat white adipocytes were isolated by a modification
of rodbelrs original method as described earlier [12].
hamster brown adipocytes were isolated from intrascapular and axillary brown adipose tissues as described by nedrergaard and lindberg [14]. a sample
of the final cellular suspension was counted in a neubauer hemocytometer. the cells were diluted to a concentration of 2-3 × 106 cells/ml with krebs-ringer
bicarbonate buffer that contained 40 mg/ml of fatty
acid-free albumin. aliquots of 200 ml were removed
for incubation with the  xxxd212xxx ,  xxxd2401xxx , or
brl-34774 in a final volume of 1 ml at 37°c in a shaking water bath. the reaction was stopped after 60
minutes by addition of 200 ~1 of 10% w/v trichloroaeetic acid. the tubes were centrifuged (2000 × g; 15 minutes), and aliquots of the supernatant were removed
for glycerol assay as described by lambert and neish
[15].

data and statistics
the pd~ value, which is the negative logarithm of the
dose of an agonist that produces half of the maximal
response (ecs0), was calculated for  xxxd2401xxx  and
 xxxd212xxx  with no antagonist present and at each
antagonist concentration, and the dose-ratio (dr) values were estimated by dividing the echo of an agonist
in the presence of antagonist by the ec~0 obtained in
the absence of it. the regression line of log (dr-l) versus the log antagonist concentration was extrapolated
to the x axis to attain the value theoretically equal to
the pa2 value of an antagonist [16].
the relative efficacy of different agonists for the
beta-adrenergic receptors was calculated by the
method of furchgott and bursztyn [17]. in binding
experiments, the data were analyzed using a nonlinear computer program (nonlinear regression analysis). the ics0 for each agonist was determined from
the best-fitting curve, and the ka values were calculated from ics0 values using the method of cheng and
prusoff [18]. the experimental data given in the text

and figures are the means _ sem of n experiments.
the significance of differences was determined by
means of analysis of variance [19]. p -< 0.05 was considered to be significant.

drugs and chemicals
 xxxd212xxx  was obtained from gensia pharmaceuticals, usa. the following drugs were also used: ( _ )
 xxxd2401xxx  (elkin-sinn, usa) and (-)propranolol
(ayerst laboratories, usa). cgp-26505, [5-phenoxy~h] was obtained from new england nuclear. brl37344 was kindly supplied by beecham laboratories,
uk.  xxxg62xxx , cocaine, collagenase, corticosterone, fatty acid free bovine albumin, histamine,
metoprolol,  xxxd2689xxx , norepinephrine, and  xxxd2914xxx  were purchased from sigma chemical company (st. louis, mo). drugs were prepared daily in
saline containing 10 mg/1 of sodium metabisulfite to
prevent spontaneous oxidation of catecholamines. all
drugs were kept in ice before use.

results

beta~-adrenergic receptors
both  xxxd212xxx  and  xxxd2401xxx  produced concentration-dependent increases in the force of contraction
of stimulated left atria. the maximal responses produced by  xxxd212xxx  and  xxxd2401xxx  were similar
(2.2 -+ 0.02 and 2.15 _ 0.12 g of tension, respectively). their pd 2 values were 8.45 _+ 0.15 and 8.55
_+ 0.02, respectively, that is,  xxxd212xxx  is about 0.8
times less potent than  xxxd2401xxx  (figure 2a). metoprolol (10 -7 to 10 -s m) shifted the concentrationresponse curves to both agonists to the right in a concentration-dependent manner (figure 2c). the slopes
of schild plots of the antagonism evoked by metoprolol
(figure 2b) were significantly different from unity,
indicating the interaction of the agonists with a heterogeneous population of adrenergic receptors. however, the estimated pa 2 value for metoprolol ranged
from 7.25 to 7.5. on isolated rat right atria, both  xxxd212xxx  and  xxxd2401xxx  increased the beating rate
in a concentration-dependent manner with a respective pd 2 value of 9.0 -+ 0.19 and 8.82 _+ 0.18. thus,
 xxxd212xxx  is 1.5 times more potent than  xxxd2401xxx  in its chronotropic action.
in a radioligand binding competition study,  xxxd212xxx  and  xxxd2401xxx  produced a concentrationdependent inhibition of cgp-26505, (5-phenoxy-sh)
binding to betal-adrenergic receptors in membranes
prepared from rat hearts (figure 3). the pd 2 values
were 6.44 ___ 0.12 and 5.6 _+ 0.2, respectively. using
these data and assuming the ki of cgp-26505 equals
0.45 nm [13], the calculated pkas of  xxxd212xxx  and
 xxxd2401xxx  were 7.32 and 6.49, respectively. the

receptors, calculated according to the method of

guinea pig ileum.  xxxd2401xxx  and  xxxd212xxx 
produced concentration-dependent relaxation of the

electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum. the concentration-response curves were shifted to the right in
the presence of (10 -6 m)  xxxd2689xxx . increasing the concentration of  xxxd2689xxx  to 10 -5 m failed to produce further shifts in the concentration-effect curves (figure
6a and 6b). apparently this is due to the saturation
of the conventional betal-adrenoceptors. however,
when the concentration of  xxxd2689xxx  was further increased, it produced further blockade. the ic30s of
 xxxd2401xxx  and  xxxd212xxx  in the absence of  xxxd2689xxx  were 2.8 × 10 -9 and 2.2 × 10 -1° m, respectively;

rat white and hamster brown adipocytes. in rat
white adipocytes, brl-37344, a selective beta 3adrenergic receptor agonist, behaved as a full agonist.
its maximal effect was approximately similar to  xxxd2401xxx , as was  xxxd212xxx . the pd2 values are
7.28 -+ 0.13, 7.6 -- 0.1, and 8.3 - 0.12 for  xxxd212xxx ,
 xxxd2401xxx , and brl-37344, respectively (figure

inducing glycerol release from rat white adipocytes,
while brl-37344 was five times more potent than  xxxd2401xxx .
in hamster brown adipocytes, as indicated in figure 7b,  xxxd212xxx  and  xxxd2401xxx  showed the
same intrinsic activity, while brl-37344 had an intrinsic activity of 0.84 relative to  xxxd2401xxx . in addition,  xxxd2401xxx  was 3.2 times more potent than
brl-37344 in releasing glycerol.  xxxd212xxx  had the
same relative potency as  xxxd2401xxx . for a given
increase in glycerol release, brl-37344 was 12 times
more potent in rat white adipocytes than in hamster
brown adipocytes.

by norepinephrine. in this preparation,  xxxd2401xxx 
did not change the resting tension of the isolated rat
aorta, even with concentrations up to 10 -4 m.

discussion
beta-adrenergic agents cause myocardial ischemia
primarily through an increase in myocardial oxygen
demand resulting from increased heart rate [20].
thus, in the myocardial region supplied by an artery
with a critical stenosis, the increase in oxygen demand
is not met by an increase in supply because the stenosis restricts blood flow, creating a condition of relative
ischemia or regional supply-demand imbalance [2].
 xxxd212xxx  is a novel catecholamine developed to be
used as cardiac stress testing. in the present study,
we investigated the interaction of this agent with different adrenergic receptors.
the positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of
catecholamines are known to be due to the activation
of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors. in rat cardiac
tissues,  xxxd212xxx  stimulated betaladrenergic receptors with a potency and efficacy similar to those
of  xxxd2401xxx  in the left atria and slightly more potent in the right (table 1). this was inferred from
the observation that metoprolol, a selective beta 1antagonist, shifted the concentration-effect curves of

both  xxxd212xxx  and  xxxd2401xxx  to the right to the
same extent. additionally,  xxxd212xxx  and  xxxd2401xxx  displaced cgp-26505 (5-phenoxy-~h), a selective
betal-antagonist [13], from its binding sites to the
same extent. in anesthetized dogs, the effect of  xxxd212xxx  on the hemodynamic functions was blocked by
propranolol [9]. however, betal-receptors are not the
exclusive subtype of adrenergic receptors in the
heart. the presence of functioning betae-, betas-, and
alpha-adrenergic receptors in the heart of different
species has been reported [21-25]. these subtypes
mediate positive inotropic and chronotropic responses
[23,26]. the slopes of schild plots of the antagonism of
metoprolol in rat left atria were significantly different
from unity, which is consistent with the involvement
of more than one receptor subtype in the actions of
 xxxd2401xxx  and  xxxd212xxx . the notion that  xxxd212xxx  stimulates not only the ~l-subtype but also
other adrenergic receptor subtypes is supported by
the observation that  xxxd212xxx  is capable of activating other beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes in guinea
pig trachea, guinea pig ileum, and rat adipocytes.
recently, the existence of a third beta-adrenergic
receptor subtype has been suggested. this putative
receptor subtype is activated by  xxxd2401xxx . however, it is resistant to blockade by concentrations of
propranolol high enough to block the classical betaland  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptor subtype [25,27]. the betas-subtype
has been identified in a variety of tissues, including
the myocardium. thus, in the cardiac tissues three
separate subtypes may mediate the same function. in
conscious dogs, stimulation of the betas-receptor subtype with the selective agonist, brl-37344, resulted
in an increase in the heart rate, a reduction in the
blood pressure, and elevation of the total peripheral
conductance. these effects were not blocked by the
conventional beta-blockers [28]. our results demonstrate that in white rat and brown hamster adipocytes,  xxxd212xxx  stimulates  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptors to release glycerol. these tissues are known
to contain  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptors. similarly, in
guinea pig ileum, both  xxxd212xxx  and  xxxd2401xxx 
activated  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptors. this effect was
resistant to blockade by 10 .5 m  xxxd2689xxx , but higher

46

abou-mohamed et al.

concentrations of  xxxd2689xxx  attenuated the actions of
 xxxd212xxx  and  xxxd2401xxx .  xxxd212xxx  was 6.8
times more potent than  xxxd2401xxx  at this receptor
site. thus, our data demonstrate that  xxxd212xxx  activates  xxxg836xxx -,  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -, and  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptors
in a manner similar to  xxxd2401xxx  with a slight difference in potencies.
strong evidence exists for the presence of alphaadrenergic receptors in the myocardium in both animals and humans [24,29]. the postjunctional alphaadrenergic receptor is believed to mediate positive
inotropic response with minimal change in the heart
rate [29-31].  xxxd212xxx  stimulated alpha-adrenergic
receptors in the rat aortic smooth muscle. however,
this effect was submaximal when compared with norepinephrine and took place at concentrations of  xxxd212xxx  far greater than that required to stimulate the
beta-receptors. thus, it is reasonable to believe that
at therapeutically effective doses,  xxxd212xxx  does
not stimulate the alpha-receptors.
an ideal pharmacological cardiac stress agent
should increase heart rate more effectively than increasing cardiac contractility. moreover, it should not
be arrhythmogenic. in dogs, administration of  xxxd212xxx  produced greater changes in the heart rate
than dobutamine. in fact, the administration of dobutamine was associated with negative chronotropic responses [7,9]. such a difference in the actions of  xxxd212xxx  and dobutamine can be explained on the basis
of their differential interactions with adrenergic receptors.  xxxd212xxx  stimulates both betal and beta~adrenergic receptors. similarly, dobutamine was
found to be equipotent in the cardiac beta 1- and tracheal  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenergic receptors [11]. thus, a divergence in the activation of beta-receptors is not likely
to explain the difference in the ultimate actions of  xxxd212xxx  and dobutamine. however, the two agents
differ notably in their interactions with the alphareceptors. at therapeutically effective doses, dobutamine is known to stimulate alpha-adrenergic receptors
[12,32], thereby increasing the afterload, increasing
left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, reducing venous capacity, and increasing coronary perfusion pressure [33-35]. these effects lead to reflex withdrawal
of the sympathetic tone. in contrast,  xxxd212xxx  does
not appreciably activate alpha-adrenergic receptors at
therapeutic doses.
another important criteria for a pharmacological
stress testing agent is that it should not be arrhythmogenic. our in vivo data indicated that  xxxd212xxx 
is less likely to produce arrhythmias than  xxxd2401xxx  [9]. these data cannot be explained in terms of
receptor actions. based on the adrenergic activities of
the two agents, it was expected that the heart rate
changes in response to  xxxd2401xxx  and  xxxd212xxx 
will be equivalent.  xxxd212xxx  is 1.5 times more
potent than  xxxd2401xxx  in stimulating the betaadrenergic receptors in the right atria (predominantly
 xxxg836xxx ). however, on  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenergic receptors in the

trachea, as in the vasculature,  xxxd212xxx  is only
about half as potent. thus, the greater ability of  xxxd2401xxx  to vasodilate will, reflexly, stimulate sympathetic nerve activity to increase the heart rate.
in conclusion,  xxxd212xxx  is a novel catecholamine
that is slightly more potent than  xxxd2401xxx  in activating betal-adrenergic receptors in rat right atria
(rate) and is of similar potency on the left atria. it
also activates tracheal  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenergic receptors in
addition to betas-ar in the adipocytes. it has no effect
on alpha-adrenergic receptors at therapeutically relevant concentrations.
