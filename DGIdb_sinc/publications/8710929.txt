abstract
neurotransmitter transporters couple to existing ion gradients to achieve reuptake of transmitter into
presynaptic terminals. for coupled cotransport, substrates
and ions cross the membrane in fixed stoichiometry. this is
in contrast to ion channels, which carry an arbitrary number
of ions depending on the channel open time. members of the
ry- xxxd2177xxx  transporter gene family presumably
function with fixed stoichiometry in which a set number of
ions cotransport with one transmitter molecule. here we
report channel-like events from a presumably fixed stoichiometry [norepinephrine (ne)+, na+, and cl-], human ne
(hnet) in the y- xxxd2177xxx  transporter gene family.
these events are stimulated by ne and by  xxxd2243xxx , an
hnet substrate, and they are blocked by cocaine and the
antidepressant desipramine. voltage-clamp data combined
with ne uptake data from these same cells indicate that
hnets have two functional modes of conduction: a classical
transporter mode (t-mode) and a novel channel mode (cmode). both t-mode and c-mode are gated by the same
substrates and antagonized by the same blockers. t-mode is
putatively electrogenic because the transmitter and cotransported ions sum to one net charge. however, c-mode carries
virtually all of the transmitter-induced current, even though
it occurs with low probability. this is because each c-mode
opening transports hundreds of charges per event. the existence of a channel mode of conduction in a previously established fixed-stoichiometry transporter suggests the appearance of an aqueous pore through the transporter protein
during the transport cycle and may have significance for
transporter regulation.

concentrations and that they require millimolar concentrations
of na and cl to function. furthermore, nets have a specific
requirement for na such that even similar ions, like li, cannot
substitute for na. nevertheless, nets recognize and transport
structurally similar substrates including epinephrine, dopamine, amphetamines, and  xxxd2243xxx  (gu). radioligand
uptake studies on resealed membrane vesicles from netcontaining cells indicate that nets function through the
stoichiometric transport of ne, na, and cl, whereby na and cl
move down their electrochemical gradients to concentrate ne.
the predicted stoichiometry of one ne', one na+, and one
cl- indicates the net transfer of one positive charge per
transport cycle. at the measured uptake velocity of approximately one ne per second, these studies would, by a naive
calculation, lead to an elementary current far below the
resolution of available biophysical techniques. indeed, 106
transporters working in unison would yield a current of less
than 0.2 pa. although other transporters have higher turnover
rates that may yield larger currents, members of the y- xxxd2177xxx  transporter gene family have low stoichiometric
flux rates similar to nets (5). thus previous studies of
electrogenic transport in the y- xxxd2177xxx  transporter
family predict extremely small transporter currents, even under saturating conditions of the transmitter and the cotransported ions. with the availability of cdna clones for specific
amine transporters, it is now possible to record currents from
populations of ne transporters. we have expressed human
nets (hnets) at a high density in hek-293 (human embryonic kidney) cells and have recorded the electrical response to
transmitters using the patch-clamp technique. transfected
cells generate currents the order of -100 pa at -100 mv (20),
well above the predicted amount. this inward current saturates
with ne concentration (30 ,um) but not with membrane
voltage. similar data have been obtained for the structurally
homologous transporters for y- xxxd2177xxx , serotonin,
and glutamate (21-28). none of these previous experiments,
however, have explained the transmitter-induced currents and
fluctuations in terms of elementary events. the present study
is an attempt to demonstrate and quantify the underlying
events responsible for ne-induced currents in cells transfected
with human ne transporters.

monoamine transporters make up an important subclass of the
y- xxxd2177xxx  transporter gene family (1, 2). they
regulate the action of catecholamines and serotonin by maintaining appropriate concentrations of the transmitter for receptors in the central and peripheral nervous systems. monoamine transporters are the targets for cocaine, antidepressants,
and amphetamines that profoundly affect chemical signaling in
central and peripheral nervous synapses. these transporters
presumably reside in presynaptic terminal membranes, where
they recycle transmitters for subsequent release (3). noradrenergic transporters, such as norepinephrine transporters
(nets), terminate noradrenergic transmission at postganglionic sympathetic synapses and may contribute to ischemic
efflux of norepinephrine (ne), leading to cardiac arrhythmias
(4). monoamine transporters also exist in the placenta, where
they assist in transplacental transfer of amines, and in blood
platelets, where they regulate blood levels of serotonin. thus,
understanding the mechanism of monoamine transport (5-7)
may shed light on both regulatory and pathological mechanisms related to amine clearance. since catecholamine transporters were first discovered over three decades ago (8-12),
the study of their mechanism has relied almost exclusively on
the uptake of radioactive ligands (13-19). from these studies
it is well known that nets saturate at submicromolar ne

results and discussion
here we present evidence that the relatively large transmitterinduced current present in transfected cells can be ascribed to
a channel-like behavior associated with hnets. as already
noted, either-ne or the false transmitter gu can induce
currents in hnet-transfected hek-293 cells (20). the neinduced currents, which are blocked by ds and cocaine, obey
the equation

gu-induced currents follow a similar pattern, although on
average, the gu-induced currents are larger than the ne-=
induced currents. at -120 mv and 130 mm na, imax(gu)
117 ± 36 pa, km(gu) = 2.4 + 0.3 am, and ngu = 1.10+ 0.14.
the hill coefficients for ne, gu, and na evaluated from the
induced currents are approximately equal to one, which is close
to the value obtained from uptake assays. we have also
measured the binding of a cocaine analogue to assess the
number of transporters, yielding an average of =106 hnets
per transfected cell (see methods). with these data, and
considering ne as a monovalent cation and gu as a trivalent
cation, imax(ne)/bmax gives a cycle rate of 340 cycles/sec and
gives 270 cycles/sec at -120 mv. these values
imax(gu)/bmax
are considerably higher than the rates measured from our
uptake studies on these same cells (20), for which vmax/bma
gives less than 1 ne/sec per hnet, in agreement with the
literature value. thus, whereas transmitter-induced currents
from hnets appear to have a stoichiometry similar to uptake,
the ne-induced currents at -120 mv (48 pa) are =300 times
too large compared with current that is expected from transport, assuming the formula i = nqr, where n is the number of
transporters per cell (106), q is the net transfer of charge per
turnover (1 e), and r is the turnover rate (one per second). one
possible explanation for the discrepancy between the rates
determined from uptake studies and the rates determined
from induced currents may be inherent differences in the two
techniques. in single-cell voltage clamp experiments, we intentionally select cells with large currents, whereas uptake
of which
experiments average over thousands of cells, some
may have low expression or be nonfunctional. thus uptake
studies may underestimate the rates. alternatively, the rate of
transfer determined by the two methods may result from
different transport mechanism within the transporter, one for
ne and the other for ions that may permeate hnet through
a transporter-associated pore. the charge transported through
such a pore might be expected to be much larger than
charge-transported by hnet via the fixed stoichiometry

difference variance: o2 = o2ne - o2ds (or o2 = a2gu - o2ds) as
a function of the concentration of ne (or gu) that induced the

to examine this latter possibility, we first investigated the

this could explain the discrepancy in rates measured by ne

of inward channel-like openings. these openings are buried

can be used to estimate the magnitude of the underlying
events.

let us first estimate the magnitude of the charge underlying
the fluctuations using shot noise theory. in this model each
event is identical, and the net current generated by random
"shots" depends on the charge q per shot and the rate r of

uncorrelated with [ne] or [gu]. an analysis of cf/i at -120

fig. 3. gaussian subtraction procedure. to extract the gu- or
ne-induced inward current evident in fig. 2 a and b, we first
constructed a gaussian curve that represents background. to construct the gaussian, we use the right limb of the histogram and reflect
it about the origin. this theoretical curve was then subtracted from the
total histogram. after this procedure, the right limb of the histogram
will obviously vanish. however, if the left limb is asymmetric with
respect to the right, the procedure will reveal an underlying component. (a) data from an inside-out patch taken from a transfected cell.
it shows that even small asymmetries may be extracted from the total
histogram by the gaussian subtraction method. with 30 ,um ne in the
pipette and v = -20 mv across the patch, the asymmetric inward
current represents a small fraction of the total amplitude (see also fig.
2). the data are shown as dark crosses, the dotted vertical line through
the peak is the axis of reflection for the theoretical gaussian, and the
solid curve is the constructed gaussian. subtracting the solid line from
the data uncovers a minor component representing the inward fluctuations (arrow in fig. 2a). at -20 mv, the peak of the inward
component revealed by this procedure is -0.12 pa (2000 hz bandwidth). (b) same patch at a higher voltage (-60 mv), but after having
added 20 alm ds to the bath (the cytoplasmic face of the patch).
although there is a substantial increase in the background current,
there is virtually no asymmetric component in the presence of ds.
using the same procedure as above, the subtraction reveals essentially
no inward component (affow in fig. 2b). in fig. 4, we use gaussian
subtraction to measure the peak of the induced inward current at
different voltages.

arrival of shots. in this case, the mean current is i = nqr, which
is the same formula used above to estimate the current
expected from transport. in the present case, however, we
allow q to be a free variable and determine its value from
fluctuation analysis. the ratio of the variance of the fluctuations to the mean current is independent of the rate of arrival
and allows us to estimate the charge that is transferred per
event. if each event is a very brief pulse (approximately a delta
function), and if we record fluctuations due to the random
arrival of these events in the bandwidth b, then the ratio of the
variance to the mean is given by the shot noise formula
(31-33),

cr2/i= 2qb.

in this formulation, the bandwidth does not appear explicitly.
nevertheless, the bandwidth imposes a restriction on observable events, namely, openings briefer than 1/2w(2000hz) =
0.1 msec cannot contribute significantly to the observed fluctuations (31). assuming that the fluctuations are due to channels
with random openings leads to the expression (fig. 1c)
i(1 -p) 0.2 pa
-

for the ne-induced currents, and about half this magnitude for
gu-induced currents (fig. 1c). the experimental value, i =
0.2 pa, is furthermore a lower limit on the elementary current,
because the probability is restricted by the formula 0 < p < 1.
moreover, 0.2 pa is greater than we would expect for the
transport of ne+:na+:cl-: if we assume a charge of le and an
open time at our limit of detection (0.1 msec), we predict an
elementary current of 0.0016 pa, which is 130 times smaller
than the current estimated from noise analysis. shot noise
analysis also predicted that the stoichiometric transport of
ne+, na+, and cl- would move <1% of the charge calculated
to move in each shot.
the fluctuation analysis presented above suggests that we
might expect to observe transporter-associated channels with
currents in the range of 0.2 pa at -120 mv. because of the
imposed bandwidth, however, we would miss channel openings
that are briefer than 0.1 msec. to look for such events, we
performed experiments on transfected cells using the patchclamp technique. fig. 2 shows that the amplitude histogram of
current fluctuations in cell-attached patches contains a left
(inward) asymmetry. this inward component of the histogram
becomes larger at negative membrane potentials (fig. 2 b and
c); furthermore, it is completely eliminated by 20 ,um ds (data
not shown), and it is absent in parental cells (fig. 2d). to
extract the amplitude of this inward component, we assumed
that the total histogram is the sum of two gaussians and used
the subtraction procedure illustrated in fig. 3. this analysis
revealed that in cell-attached patches, at membrane potentials
between -20 and -80 mv, the inward current varied linearly
with voltage with a slope of 3.2 ± 0.4 ps (n = 6). although this
analysis suggests hnet-associated channels of the size predicted from whole-cell fluctuation analysis, we rarely observed
channels as discrete events in cell-attached patches. furthermore, the cell-attached configuration recordings may be compromised by changes in the cell resting potential. inside-out
patches offer a solution to these limitations (fig. 4a). removing the patch from the cell reveals distinct elementary events
that are more easily resolved in amplitude histograms. these
inward currents are blocked by 2 ,um ds added to the bath to
the inside face of the membrane (fig. 4b, right). complete ds

requires up to 10 min in 2 jum. as in cell-attached
patches, this inward component of the patch currents is not
present in parental cells. although the elementary currents in
inside-out patches appear more distinct than in cell-attached
patches, long-lived events (see arrow, inset) are rare. we
therefore rely on the gaussian subtraction procedure (fig. 3)
to measure the amplitude of the current. fig. 4b shows that,
for inside-out patches voltage clamped between 0 and -80
mv, the gu-induced inward current varies linearly with
voltage and has a slope y 2.95 ± 0.17 ps. we will refer to
this hnet-associated conductance as the channel mode (cmode) of conductance. in addition to induced currents, neurotransmitter transporters have well-documented leak currents (6, 7). we define leak through hnets as the ds-sensitive
current revealed in transfected cells independent of the presence of transmitter (20). on average, the leak current is only
10% of the induced current; thus it could be due to a smaller
channel or the same channel at lower probability. we have
attempted to find single-channel events linked to leak currents
block

without success.
because we observe discrete events with variable open times
in cell-detached patches, we adopt the channel description for
hnet-associated c-mode conduction. two lines of evidence
suggest that the probability of c-mode conduction is extremely
low. for channels, the macroscopic current is given by i = nip.

fig. 4. inside-out patches. gu induces channel-like activity in inside-out patches. (a, left) raw
data and an amplitude histogram from an insideout patch containing 30 am gu (-80 mv). we
used gu in these patch experiments to avoid
complications of oxidation; furthermore, no gu
receptors exist and the likelihood of false signals is
less. finally, although we obtained similar results
with ne, gu gave more consistent events that
were easier to analyze. at -80 mv, we can observe
distinct inward current spikes. however, at voltages
between 0 and -40 mv events are less visible. thus
we used the gaussian subtraction procedure (fig.
3) to quantify the gu-induced current at different
voltages, even in those cases where single events
are clear. the amplitude of the current at each
voltage is defined as the center of the revealed
inward component with respect to zero. this difference is shown as vertical dashed lines: in this
example i = -0.25 pa. (right) same patch 1 min
after adding 2 ,tm ds to the bath. at 1 min the
block is incomplete, as indicated by inward spikes
and the slight asymmetry in the histogram. waiting
up to 10 min, or using stronger concentrations of
ds (20 ,um), completely abolishes these inward
currents. (b) i(v) curve constructed by the method
outlined in a (left). at large negative voltages we
can occasionally observe long openings; however,
these were too inconsistent to quantify. the inset in
the i(v) curve shows an example of one of these
rare, long events (arrow). the conductance defined
by the gaussian subtraction procedure in a bandwidth of 2000 hz is linear in the range -20 to -80
mv with the value yhnet = 2.95 + 0.17 ps (n = 4).

although we do not have an accurate measurement of n for
a given cell, we can take the average number of [125i]33-[4iodophenyl]tropan-2/3-carboxylic acid methyl ester sites per
transfected cell (20) as an approximation for n and estimate
a value for p. for n
106, thenp 0.0005. this means that,
if the whole-cell current has the value 100 pa and if the
underlying event is 0.2 pa, then the probability of c mode is
the order of 0.5 x 10-3. a more subtle argument involves the
concentration dependence of i and of i(1 p). our data show
that whereas the whole-cell current, i = nip, depends on [ne]
or [gu] according to a michaelis-menten relationship (20),
the variance-to-mean ratio, o2/i = i(1 p), is approximately
independent of [ne] or [gu] (fig. 1). for these data to be
consistent, then the probability,p, must be much less than one.
considering these arguments, we propose the following description to encompass the voltage and concentration dependence of the macroscopic current and the current fluctuations

from a comparison of ne transport and ne-induced current, we estimated that at negative voltages, "300 charges
cross the membrane for each molecule of ne transported.
furthermore, shot noise analysis indicated that "300 electronic charges make up each unitary event. a similar analysis
of the noise as channel activity gave "130 electronic charges
per event. thus the electrical events occur with about the same
frequency as transport. while this may be coincidence, it is also
possible that the transporter opens as a transmembrane ion
channel every time it transports ne.
finally, we note that the parameter po, which is the maximum value for the probability of opening, may be different for
different substrates. we have shown that under similar conditions of transmitter-induced current, i(gu) > i(ne). a congruous explanation would be thatpo(gu) > po(ne). in other
words, gu is more effective than ne at opening the channel.
once the channel is open, however, the current is the same for
either substrate. this model explains transmitter uptake measured by radioligands, the michaelis-menten dependence of
ne- and na-induced current, the voltage dependence of the
induced current, the concentration dependence of the induced
current, the magnitude of the whole-cell current, and the
magnitude of the current fluctuations.
these experiments demonstrate that hnets that have both
transporter modes and c-modes of conduction. a michaelismenten analysis of uptake and substrate-induced currents
indicates hill coefficients for ne (or gu) and na near n = 1
(20). in addition, hnet requires one cl ion for ne transport
(7), and recently the ion coupling stoichiometry for hnets
that we have assumed in this paper has been confirmed (34).
these data suggest that although transporter mode is electrogenic, it generates negligible current. indeed, 106 hnets
transporting a net charge of 1 e at rate of one per second would
generate a current of only 0.16 pa. although the probability
of any given channel being open is low, c-mode carries the
majority of the current. our conclusion that c-mode dominates ne-induced current in hnets does not generalize to
other cotransporters. in mammalian serotonin transporters,
which are reported to be electroneutral (19), the serotonininduced current and the number of seratonin molecules transported are in approximate agreement (24). however, in glutamate transporters, although c-mode is present, the majority
of current can be carried in transporter mode (35). furthermore, the relative contributions of transporter mode and
c-mode may vary even among homologues of these transporters (27). does c-mode conduction exist in native preparations? no evidence of this type exists for ne transporters. a
large current is associated with serotonin uptake in hirudo
neurons (22); however, the number and turnover rate of these
transporters is unknown. evidence for c-mode in a native
preparation comes from noise analysis, which has revealed
channel behavior in glutamate transporters in salamander
photoreceptors (36).
if hnet combines the properties of a classical cotransporter
with a transmitter-gated ion channel, as our data suggest,
questions arise concerning the consequences of this behavior
for transporter function. is transport necessary to stimulate
channel activity? is c-mode an obligate step in gating amine
flux? must the substrate bind to open the channel? does the
same pore that carries the majority of the current carry the
neurotransmitter? finally, does c-mode exist in native tissue,
and, if so, what are the consequences of the currents associated
with hnet for neural transmission? these questions await
further investigation. certainly a greater time resolution of
hnet-associated events has been achieved, offering a new
approach for investigations into transporter mechanisms and
regulation. properties of net revealed in detached patches
