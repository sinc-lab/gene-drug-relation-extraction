the primary function of the heart is to pump blood, and this
function depends directly on the capacity of cardiac muscle to
generate force. parallel arrays of thick and thin myofilaments
organized into sarcomeres within cardiac myocytes are directly
responsible for this force generation. specifically, myosin cross* this work was supported in part by the canadian institutes of

bridges on thick filaments attach to actin on thin filaments to
produce force. this actomyosin interaction is regulated by troponin, a heteotrimeric complex on thin filaments that is comprised of the ca2⫹-binding subunit  xxxg2307xxx  (ctnc),1 inhibitory subunit troponin i ( xxxg2309xxx ), and tropomyosin-binding
subunit troponin t (ctnt) (for recent reviews, see refs. 1 and 2).
the troponin complex recognizes the transient increase in
cytosolic ca2⫹ levels in the cardiac myocytes to initiate cardiac
muscle contraction. this critical function is accomplished by
ctnc, a member of the ef-hand family of ca2⫹-binding proteins. the nmr solution structure of ctnc has been determined, and it revealed the presence of two globular domains, n
and c, joined by a flexible linker in solution (3). the overall fold
of the ctnc structure is very similar to that of skeletal muscle
 xxxg2307xxx  (stnc) (4 – 6) as a result of a 70% primary sequence
identity between the two isoforms (7). however, the significant
differences in the first 40 residues, particularly the presence of
a defunct ca2⫹-binding site i in ctnc, leads to strikingly different ca2⫹-induced structural changes in the n-domain of the
two proteins. while sntnc switches from a “closed” to an
“open” conformation upon the binding of two ca2⫹ ions (8, 9),
cntnc undergoes minimal conformational changes and remains essentially closed upon the binding of one ca2⫹ ion (10).
the exposed hydrophobic surface in the ca2⫹-saturated stnc
serves as the stni-binding site (11, 12). despite the significant
reduction in the hydrophobic surface exposure of ca2⫹-saturated ctnc,  xxxg2309xxx  is able to force open the regulatory domain
and binds in a similar fashion as stni (13). the end results are
that both the regulatory domains of stnc and ctnc adopt
similar open conformations when bound to their respective tni
regions (stni115–131 and ctni147–163) (13, 14). this region of tni
has been identified by many biological and biophysical studies
to be the region directly responsible for binding to the regulatory domain of tnc, and this interaction modulates those between the n-terminal (stni1– 40 and ctni34 –71) and the inhibitory regions (stni96 –115 and ctni128 –147) of tni and tnc (for
reviews, see refs. 15 and 16). this conclusion is reinforced by
the recently reported 2.6-å x-ray structure of the
ctnc䡠3ca2⫹䡠ctni34 –210䡠ctnt2182–288 complex (17), in which the
regions encompassing cntnc䡠ca2⫹ and ctni147–163 match the
nmr solution structure of the cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163 complex (13). thus, the sequence of events involved in initiating
skeletal and cardiac muscle contraction are actually very similar. however, these events are controlled by delicate energetic

cardiac  xxxg2307xxx  (ctnc) is the ca2ⴙ-dependent
switch for contraction in heart muscle and a potential
target for drugs in the therapy of heart failure. ca2ⴙ
binding to the regulatory domain of ctnc (cntnc) induces little structural change but sets the stage for  xxxg2309xxx 
binding. a large “closed” to “open” conformational transition occurs in the regulatory domain upon binding
ctni147–163 or  xxxd318xxx . this raises the question of whether
ctni147–163 and  xxxd318xxx  compete for cntnc䡠ca2ⴙ. in this
work, we used two-dimensional 1h,15n-heteronuclear
single quantum coherence (hsqc) nmr spectroscopy to
examine the binding of  xxxd318xxx  to cntnc䡠ca2ⴙ in the
absence and presence of ctni147–163 and of ctni147–163 to
cntnc䡠ca2ⴙ in the absence and presence of  xxxd318xxx . the
results show that  xxxd318xxx  and ctni147–163 bind
cntnc䡠ca2ⴙ simultaneously but with negative cooperativity. the affinity of ctni147–163 for cntnc䡠ca2ⴙ is reduced ⬃ 3.5-fold by  xxxd318xxx  and vice versa. using
multinuclear and multidimensional nmr spectroscopy,
we have determined the structure of the cntnc䡠
ca2ⴙ䡠ctni147–163䡠bepridil ternary complex. the structure
reveals a binding site for ctni147–163 primarily located
on the a/b interhelical interface and a binding site for
 xxxd318xxx  in the hydrophobic pocket of cntnc䡠ca2ⴙ. in
the structure, the n terminus of the peptide clashes with
part of the  xxxd318xxx  molecule, which explains the negative cooperativity between ctni147–163 and  xxxd318xxx  for
cntnc䡠ca2ⴙ. this structure provides insights into the
features that are important for the design of ctnc-specific cardiotonic drugs, which may be used to modulate
the ca2ⴙ sensitivity of the myofilaments in heart muscle
contraction.

materials and methods

sample preparation
the engineering of the expression vector of cntnc-(1– 89) mutant
was as described in chandra et al. (24). the expression of 15n- and
15
n/13c-labeled cntnc in escherichia coli was as described previously
(25). the synthetic peptide ctni147–163, acetyl-risadammqallgarak-amide, was prepared and characterized as described previously
(13).  xxxd318xxx  was purchased from sigma-aldrich. stock solutions (93
mm and 46.5 mm, respectively) of  xxxd318xxx  in me2so-d6 (cambridge
isotopes inc.) were prepared, and the vials containing the solutions
were wrapped in aluminum foil due to its sensitivity to light. all nmr
samples were 500 ␮l in volume. the buffer conditions were 100 mm kcl,
10 mm imidazole in 90% h2o/10% d2o, 15 mm dithiothreitol, and the
ph was 6.8. two  xxxd318xxx  titrations were performed, one to a
cntnc䡠ca2⫹ sample and the other to a cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163 complex
sample. two ctni147–163 titrations were performed, one using 15ncntnc䡠ca2⫹ and the other with the 15n-cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠bepridil complex.
for structure determination, nmr samples contain 1–2 mm cntnc,
6 – 8 mm ca2⫹, 1–2 mm  xxxd318xxx , and 3– 6 mm ctni147–163.

ctni147–163 and  xxxd318xxx  titration of 15n-cntnc䡠ca2⫹ monitored
by two-dimensional 1h,15n-hsqc nmr spectra
titration of 15n-cntnc䡠ca2⫹ with ctni147–163—this titration reproduces the titration reported previously (13). ctni147–163 peptide is
highly soluble in aqueous solution but tends to form a gel at high

concentrations (⬎50 mm), likely due to aggregation. thus, no stock
peptide solution was prepared; instead, solid peptide was added at
every titration point. to a nmr tube containing a 500-␮l sample of 0.56
mm 15n-cntnc䡠ca2⫹, solid ctni147–163 was added for the seven titration
points. the sample was mixed thoroughly with each addition. 2 ␮l of
sample was taken at every titration point for amino acid analysis to
determine the peptide/protein ratios. changes in ph associated with
ctni147–163 additions were compensated for by adjusting to ph 6.8 at
every titration point.
titration of 15n-cntnc䡠ca2⫹ with  xxxd318xxx —to an nmr tube containing a 500-␮l sample of 0.50 mm 15n-cntnc䡠ca2⫹, aliquots of 0.5 ␮l
of 93 mm  xxxd318xxx  in me2so-d6 were added for the nine titration points.
the sample was mixed thoroughly with each addition. the total volume
increase was 4.5 ␮l, and the change in protein concentration due to
dilution was taken into account for data analysis. the change in ph
from  xxxd318xxx  addition was negligible. as a control experiment, a twodimensional 1h,15n-hsqc nmr spectrum of 15n-cntnc䡠ca2⫹ in the
presence of 4.5 ␮l of pure me2so-d6 was acquired to confirm that
me2so-d6 has no effect on 15n-cntnc䡠ca2⫹.
titration of 15n-cntnc䡠ctni147–163 with  xxxd318xxx —to a 500-␮l nmr
sample containing 0.58 mm 15n-cntnc䡠ca2⫹ and 2.0 mm ctni147–163,
aliquots of 1 ␮l of 46.5 mm  xxxd318xxx  in me2so-d6 were added for the six
titration points. the sample was mixed thoroughly after each addition,
and no precipitation was observed. the change in ph from the addition
of  xxxd318xxx  was negligible. the total volume increase was 6 ␮l, and the
change in protein concentration due to dilution was taken into account
for data analysis.
titration of 15n-cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠bepridil with ctni147–163—to a 500-␮l
nmr sample containing 0.50 mm 15n-cntnc䡠ca2⫹, aliquots of 6 ␮l of
46.5 mm  xxxd318xxx  in me2so-d6 were added to obtain a 1:1 15ncntnc䡠ca2⫹: xxxd318xxx  complex. solid ctni147–163 peptide was added at
every titration point. the sample was mixed thoroughly with each
addition. 2 ␮l of sample was taken at every titration point for amino
acid analysis to determine the peptide/protein ratios. changes in ph
associated with ctni147–163 additions were compensated for by adjusting to ph 6.8 at every titration point. precipitation of free  xxxd318xxx  was
not observed during the titration.

nmr spectroscopy
most nmr data used in this study were collected at 30 °c using
unity 600 mhz and unity inova 500-mhz spectrometers. both spectrometers are equipped with triple resonance probes and z-pulsed field
gradients. two-dimensional 1h,15n-hsqc spectra were acquired using
the sensitivity-enhanced gradient pulse scheme developed by lewis e.
kay and coworkers (26, 27). for cntnc in the ternary complex, the
chemical shift assignments of the backbone and side-chain atoms and
noe interproton distance restraints were determined using two-dimensional and three-dimensional nmr experiments described in table
i. for the bound ctni147–163 peptide, the proton chemical shifts of the
peptide were assigned using two-dimensional 15n/13c-filtered noesy
(250-ms mixing time) and two-dimensional 15n/13c-filtered dipsi experiments (43.2-ms spinlock time). the pulse sequences for these two
experiments were based on ogura et al. (28) with extensive modifications by leo spyracopoulos.2 one-dimensional 1h and two-dimensional
dipsi spectra of free  xxxd318xxx  in me2so-d6 and in h2o were obtained to
help in the assignment of the  xxxd318xxx  in the ternary complex. the
intermolecular proton distances between cntnc and ctni147–163 and
 xxxd318xxx  were obtained using three-dimensional 15n/13c f1-filtered, f3edited noesy hsqc experiments employing linear frequency ramped
broadband inversion pulses for 13c (150-ms mixing time) (30).

data processing and peak calibration
all two-dimensional and three-dimensional nmr data was processed
using nmrpipe (31) and all one-dimensional nmr data were processed
using vnmr 6.1b (varian inc.). the spectra were analyzed using
nmrview (32). for cntnc in the complex, intramolecular distance
restraints obtained from the noesy experiments were calibrated according to gagné et al. (33). intramolecular proton distances for the
peptide and  xxxd318xxx  in the complex were calibrated by classifying noe
intensities as strong (2– 4 å), medium (3–5 å), and weak (4 – 6 å).
intermolecular noes between  xxxd318xxx  and cntnc, between ctni147–163
and cntnc, and between  xxxd318xxx  and ctni147–163 were obtained from
the 15n/13c-filtered and the 15n/13c-filtered/edited experiments. dihedral angle restraints for cntnc in the complex were derived from data
obtained from hnha, hnhb, and noesy-hsqc experiments accord2

balance for the two systems to account for the different physiological behavior of the two muscle types (18).
the essential role of ctnc in the regulation of heart muscle
contraction makes it an attractive target for cardiotonic drugs
in the therapy of heart diseases. these drugs are expected to
tune the cardiac function by modulating the ca2⫹ sensitivity of
the myofilaments and the myofilament protein interactions.
 xxxd318xxx  is one member of the pharmacological compounds capable of binding ctnc and modulating its ca2⫹ binding affinity
(19, 20). the affinity of  xxxd318xxx  has been reported to be ⬃10 ␮m
for isolated ctnc (20) and ⬃140 ␮m for the ctnc䡠ctni complex
(21). an nmr study, using met residues as markers, identified
three  xxxd318xxx  binding sites in ctnc (22). in the x-ray structure
of the ctnc䡠3ca2⫹䡠3bepridil complex (23), two  xxxd318xxx  molecules located in the hydrophobic cavity between domains pull
the domains close together to result in a compact structure for
ctnc, and a third  xxxd318xxx  appears to stabilize an open regulatory domain conformation by binding to the center of the hydrophobic pocket, much like ctni147–163.
the fact that both ctni147–163 and  xxxd318xxx  can induce a
structural ‘opening’ in the n-domain of ctnc by interacting
with the hydrophobic patch of the domain prompted us to
explore whether ctni147–163 and  xxxd318xxx  compete for cntnc䡠
ca2⫹. to address this issue, we used two-dimensional 1h,15n
hsqc nmr spectroscopy to examine the binding of  xxxd318xxx  to
cntnc䡠ca2⫹ in the absence and presence of ctni147–163 and of
ctni147–163 to cntnc䡠ca2⫹ in the absence and presence of
 xxxd318xxx . the results show that the drug and ctni147–163
peptide bind to cntnc䡠ca2⫹ simultaneously but with negative cooperativity. the affinity of ctni147–163 for cntnc䡠ca2⫹
is reduced ⬃3.5-fold by  xxxd318xxx  and vice versa. using
multinuclear and multidimensional nmr spectroscopy, we
have determined the structure of the ternary cntnc䡠
ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163䡠bepridil complex. the structure reveals a
binding site for ctni147–163 primarily located on the a/b interhelical interface and a binding site for  xxxd318xxx  in the hydrophobic core of cntnc䡠ca2⫹. in the structure, the n terminus
of the peptide clashes with part of the  xxxd318xxx  molecule,
which explains the observed negative cooperativity between
ctni147–163 and  xxxd318xxx  for cntnc䡠ca2⫹. the current structure
provides insights into the features that are important for the
design of ctnc-specific cardiotonic drugs, which may be used to
tune the cardiac function by modulating the ca2⫹ sensitivity of
the myofilaments and the myofilament protein interactions.

results and discussion

effect of  xxxd318xxx  and ctni147–163 on cntnc䡠ca2⫹—the assigned two-dimensional 1 h,15 n-hsqc nmr spectrum of
cntnc䡠ca2⫹ (10) was used to monitor the binding of  xxxd318xxx 
and/or ctni147–163 to cntnc䡠ca2⫹, the assigned two-dimensional
1
h,15n-hsqc nmr spectrum of cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163 (13)
was used to monitor  xxxd318xxx  binding to cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163,
and the assigned two-dimensional 1h,15n-hsqc nmr spectrum
of cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠bepridil3 was used to monitor the binding of
ctni147–163 to cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠bepridil. using residues leu-29 and
glu-66 of cntnc as examples, fig. 1 depicts the ctni147–163induced peak shifts on cntnc䡠ca2⫹ (arrow a), the  xxxd318xxx -induced
peak shifts on cntnc䡠ca2⫹ (arrow b), the  xxxd318xxx -induced peak
shifts on cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163 (arrow c), and the ctni147–163induced peak shifts on cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠bepridil (arrow d). it is
important to point out that these two residues do exemplify all
of the residues in the protein, which undergo backbone amide
1
h or 15n chemical shift changes during titrations. in fig. 1,
arrows a and d represent the binding of ctni147–163 to
cntnc䡠ca2⫹ in the absence and presence of  xxxd318xxx , respectively, whereas arrows b and c represent the binding of  xxxd318xxx  to cntnc䡠ca2⫹ in the absence and presence of ctni147–163,
respectively. it is interesting to notice that arrows a and b
point to different directions, but arrows c and d point to the
same end position. this indicates that a stable ternary
cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163䡠bepridil complex forms in the end regardless of whether  xxxd318xxx  was added first followed by
ctni147–163 or vice versa. this observation is reminiscent of our
previous work on emd 57033 and ctni128 –147 binding to
ctnc䡠3ca2⫹, where we demonstrated that both emd 57033
and ctni128 –147 bind ctnc䡠3ca2⫹ in 1:1 ratios in a noncompetitive manner (36). neither is emd 57033 binding affected
by ctni128 –147 nor does emd 57033 affect ctni128 –147 binding. in
the end, a stable ternary ctnc䡠3ca2⫹䡠ctni128 –147䡠emd 57033
complex is formed. using the same approach as for ctni128 –147
and emd 57033 binding to ctnc, we analyzed the chemical
shift changes as a function of the ligand to protein ratios and
determined the binding affinities of  xxxg2309xxx  147–163 for
cntnc䡠ca2⫹ in the absence and presence of  xxxd318xxx  and those
of  xxxd318xxx  for cntnc䡠ca2⫹ in the absence and presence of

ctni147–163. in contrast to the interaction of emd 57033 and
ctni128 –147 with ctnc䡠3ca2⫹, where the affinity of one ligand
is not affected by the other, the affinity of ctni147–163 for
cntnc䡠ca2⫹ is decreased ⬃3.5-fold (from a kd of 154 ⫾ 30 ␮m
to a kd of 550 ⫾ 50 ␮m) by the presence of  xxxd318xxx , and that of
 xxxd318xxx  for cntnc䡠ca2⫹ is also decreased ⬃3.5-fold (from a kd
of 23 ⫾ 5 ␮m to a kd of 80 ⫾ 15 ␮m) by the presence of
ctni147–163. this is somewhat surprising, because  xxxd318xxx  has
been shown to increase both the activity of actomyosin atpase
and force generation in vitro (19, 20), and this increase was
observed in both slow/cardiac and fast skeletal muscle fibers,
with the effect being greater in slow/cardiac fibers (37). however, this is in agreement with a recent study (21) that shows
an apparent weaker binding of  xxxd318xxx  to the ctnc regulatory
domain in the ctnc䡠ctni complex (⬃140 ␮m) than to the isolated ctnc (⬃10 ␮m), and  xxxd318xxx  is also shown to inhibit
calmodulin from binding to its target proteins (38). although
several possible explanations could account for the apparent
difference in binding affinities, the most obvious one would be
that the partially positive charged group of  xxxd318xxx , while
binding to cntnc䡠3ca2⫹, hinder the binding of the positively
charged  xxxg2309xxx  to ctnc, and vice versa. this is what we have
observed in the ternary cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163䡠bepridil complex as described below. the observed negative cooperativity

using an initial set of intramolecular noe restraints for cntnc, 100
structures of cntnc alone were calculated starting from an extended
conformation. the calculations were done using simulated annealing
protocol implemented in x-plor (35) with 10,000 high temperature
steps (time step of 30 ps) and 6000 cooling steps (time step of 30 ps).
approximately 50% of the initial structures converged. these structures were used as templates for further rounds of refinements. dihedral angle restraints and six artificial distance restraints from chelating oxygen atoms to ca2⫹ ion were added at later stages of the
refinement process. the structure of the ternary complex was calculated starting from the extended conformations of cntnc,  xxxd318xxx , and
ctni147–163 peptide using simulated annealing protocol with the same
conditions as above. the calculations were carried out using the distance and the ␾, ␺, and ␹1 dihedral restraints for cntnc and for
ctni147–163 (see table ii), 6 distance restraints to the ca2⫹ ion, 28
intermolecular distance restraints between cntnc and  xxxd318xxx , 30
intermolecular distance restraints between cntnc and ctni147–163 peptide, 24 intramolecular distance restrains for the bound ctni147–163
peptide, as well as an intermolecular distance restraint between  xxxd318xxx  and ctni147–163 (see table ii). the final family of solution structures
presented in this report consists of the 30 lowest energy structures.

structure of cntnc in the ternary complex—cntnc in the
present structure exhibits an overall fold resembling other
ca2⫹-bound domains in the ef-hand family, such as the ndomain of stnc. the secondary structural elements of cntnc
in the ternary cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163䡠bepridil complex are
similar to those in the cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163 complex (13)
and the cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠bepridil complex (23). the five helices, n,
a, b, c, and d, are well-defined, superimposing with individual
backbone r.m.s.d. values of 0.17 ⫾ 0.04 å for helix n (residues
5–11), 0.35 ⫾ 0.07 å for helix a (residues 14 –27), 0.23 ⫾ 0.05
å for helix b (residues 38 – 47), 0.22 ⫾ 0.03 å for helix c
(residues 58 – 68), and 0.26 ⫾ 0.05 å for helix d (residues
74 – 83). the two ef-hand ca2⫹-binding sites are joined by a
short antiparallel ␤-sheet. the ␤-sheet (residues 35–37, 71–73)
is well-defined with a backbone r.m.s.d. of 0.22 ⫾ 0.04 å,
whereas the ca2⫹-binding sites have a slightly more flexible
structure (a backbone r.m.s.d. of 0.41 ⫾ 0.08 å). the n- and
c-terminal residues (residues 1– 4 and 86 – 89) are less well
defined than the helices or the ␤-sheet.
the global fold of cntnc in the ternary cntnc䡠
ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163䡠bepridil complex is similar to the open
cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163 structure as determined by nmr
spectroscopy (13) and the cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠bepridil structure as
determined by x-ray crystallography (23). the orientations of
the five helices are similar to those in the two binary complexes, cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163 and cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠bepridil. the
a/b and c/d interhelical angles are 118° ⫾ 3° and 90° ⫾ 3°,
respectively, representing nearly perpendicular orientations
for the a/b and c/d helix pairs, characteristic of an open
conformation for an ef-hand domain. however, interhelical
angle analysis (see table iii) indicates that, although cntnc
in the ternary complex is open as compared with the closed
cntnc䡠apo (exhibiting a/b and c/d interhelical angles of
136° ⫾ 3° and 129° ⫾ 5°, respectively) or cntnc䡠ca2⫹ (exhibiting a/b and c/d interhelical angles of 132° ⫾ 3° and 117° ⫾
3°, respectively), it is slightly more closed than cntnc䡠
ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163 (exhibiting a/b and c/d interhelical angles of
102° ⫾ 5° and 96° ⫾ 5°, respectively) or cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠bepridil
(exhibiting a/b and c/d interhelical angles of 92° and 89°,
respectively). thus, although either ctni147–163 or  xxxd318xxx  alone
can induce and stabilize the open conformation of cntnc䡠ca2⫹,
the hindrance between the two resulted in a less stable open
conformation for cntnc䡠ca2⫹. this hindrance is evident in the
ternary structure as discussed below, and it explains the observed negative cooperativity between the two ligands.

 xxxd318xxx  on muscle fibers may result from a combination of
many integrated effects within the myofibrillar lattice.
overall structure of the ternary complex—the two-dimensional 1h,15n-hsqc nmr spectrum of cntnc in the ternary
cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163䡠bepridil complex was highly resolved,
allowing the chemical shifts of the backbone and the side-chain
atoms to be assigned readily using 15n- and/or 15n/13c-labeled
protein. distance restraints for cntnc in the ternary complex
were obtained by analyzing three-dimensional 15n- or 15n/13cedited noesy experiments. dihedral angle restraints for
cntnc in the ternary complex were obtained from three-dimensional hnha, three-dimensional hnhb, and 15n-edited
noesy experiments. the nmr experiments performed are
summarized in table i.
the proton nmr chemical shift assignments and intramolecular distance restraints for the bound ctni147–163 peptide
and  xxxd318xxx  required the collection of 15n/13c-filtered twodimensional dipsi and two-dimensional noesy experiments
using unlabeled ctni147–163 and  xxxd318xxx  in complex with 15n/
13
c-labeled cntnc. these experiments removed all of the resonance peaks arising from 15n/13c-labeled cntnc.2 one-dimensional 1h and two-dimensional dipsi nmr spectra of free
 xxxd318xxx  in me2so-d6 were also analyzed to aid the assignments
of  xxxd318xxx  in the ternary complex. intermolecular noes between cntnc and ctni147–163 and between cntnc and  xxxd318xxx 
were determined from three-dimensional 15n/13c-filtered, 15n/
13
c-edited noesy data. these experiments were optimized for
detecting noes between protons attached to 14n/12c and protons attached to 15n/13c, thereby editing out all the intramolecular noes. a total of 1359 experimental distance restraints
(⬃14 restraints per residue for cntnc), including 1169 intramolecular cntnc distance restraints, 24 intramolecular
ctni147–163 distance restraints, 2 intramolecular  xxxd318xxx  distance restraints, 30 intermolecular contacts between cntnc
and ctni147–163, 28 intermolecular contacts between cntnc
and  xxxd318xxx , 88 dihedral restraints for cntnc, 6 dihedral
restraints for ctni147–163, and 6 distance restraints to ca2⫹
were used to calculate the high resolution structure of the
ternary cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163䡠bepridil complex (see table
ii). fig. 2a depicts the ensemble of 30 lowest energy structures
of the ternary complex in stereo view, with overall structural
statistics and conformational energies for the ensemble provided in table ii. the ribbon representations of the structure
of the ternary complex are shown in fig. 2b. the structures of
cntnc in the complex are of higher quality than those of
ctni147–163 or  xxxd318xxx , as a result of more restraints for the
protein than for the ligands. a close view of the skeleton representations of ctni147–163 and  xxxd318xxx  are shown in fig. 2c.

a large angle defines a closed conformation, whereas a small angle defines an open conformation. the axis for an ␣-helix is defined by two
points, taken as the average coordinates of the first and last 11 backbone atoms of the ␣-helix.

r.m.s.d. values are almost identical for the two structures. this
is because that the helical structure is mainly determined by ␾
and ␺ dihedral restraints. the orientation of the ctni147–163
peptide in the ternary complex was determined using the same
approach as for cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163 (13). noes between
peptide methyl groups with degenerate chemical shifts and
cntnc were unambiguously assigned by using a specifically
deuterated ctni147–163 peptide, containing deuterated methyl
groups at ala-150, met-154, leu-158, and ala-162 located on
one side of the helical peptide. the assigned intermolecular
noes between cntnc and ctni147–163 are summarized in fig.
4. these noe contacts dictate a similar orientation for the
ctni147–163 in the ternary cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163䡠bepridil
complex as compared with that in the binary cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠
ctni147–163 complex. the peptide inserts between the a and b
helices in cntnc with the n terminus (residues 147–149), and
the helical region interacts with the protein, whereas the c
terminus does not interact with the protein and remains disordered in the ensemble of the solution structures (fig. 2a).
specifically, the helical portion of the peptide (residues 150 –
156) sits between the a and b helical interface, contacting the
methyl group of residues ala-22 and ala-23 in the a-helix and
val-44, met-45, met-47, and leu-48 in the b-helix. the n
terminus of the peptide extends into the hydrophobic pocket of
cntnc, making contacts to the methyl groups of met-60, met80, and met-85 in cntnc. as discussed above, the n-terminal
residue arg-147 of the peptide contacts protons attached to c9
and c10 of the pyrrolidine ring of  xxxd318xxx  (figs. 2c and 3).
thus, in the presence of  xxxd318xxx , the ctni147–163 peptide retained its basic secondary structure and orientation as adopted
in the cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163 binary complex, however, its
position in the a/b helical interface is shifted to accommodate
the drug molecule (see below).
comparison of the ternary cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163䡠bepridil
structure with the binary cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163 and
cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠bepridil structures—the conformational change
in cntnc䡠ca2⫹ that occurs upon binding ctni147–163 (13) or
 xxxd318xxx  (23) involves the straightening of the b-helix and the
bc unit moving away from the nad unit, consisting of a closed
to open structural transition. this peptide- or drug-induced
structural change in cntnc䡠ca2⫹ is similar to that observed for
the apo to ca2⫹-saturated transition observed for sntnc (8). a
somewhat surprising finding from the current study is that,
despite the simultaneous presence of the two ligands that are
capable of inducing the opening of cntnc䡠ca2⫹, cntnc䡠ca2⫹
is, in fact, more closed than if either one of the ligands
was complexed to cntnc䡠ca2⫹ alone. this is demonstrated
in fig. 5. when the nad unit of cntnc in cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠
ctni147–163䡠bepridil superimposes onto the nad unit of
cntnc in cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163, the bc unit moved up
3.9 ⫾ 0.7 å (fig. 5a). this change is also reflected in the a/b
and c/d interhelical angle changes (see above and table iii).
this is a result of altered noe contacts between cntnc and
ctni147–163 from cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163 to cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠
ctni147–163䡠bepridil. for instance, in cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163,

downloaded from http://www.jbc.org/ by guest on october 15, 2019

for  xxxd318xxx  were obtained. strip plots taken from the threedimensional 15n/13c f1-filtered, f3-edited spectrum of
cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163䡠bepridil complex are shown in fig. 4.
in this spectrum, only noes arising from the 12c-attached
protons in the ctni147–163 and  xxxd318xxx  and terminating on
13
c-attached protons in cntnc are observed.2 the two aromatic rings of the  xxxd318xxx  made significant hydrophobic contact to the protein. in particular, the benzyl ring made hydrophobic contacts with the methyl groups on residues of the
b-helix (residues leu-41, val-44, met-45, and leu-48) and the
phenyl ring made contacts to residues of the c-helix (methyl
groups of met-60 and ile-61) as well as the residues composing
the ca2⫹-binding loops (methyl groups of ile-36, val-64, and
val-72). as a result, the two aromatic rings of  xxxd318xxx  are
inserted as a “wedge” between the a/d and b/c units, sterically
hindering the closing of cntnc. the pyrrolidine ring and the
isopropyl moieties made few contacts with the protein. the only
noes observed between the pyrrolidine ring and the protein is
between h8# and h11# protons of  xxxd318xxx  (see fig. 3a) and the
methyl h⑀# group of ile-60 in the c-helix of cntnc. similarly,
only weak noes between side chains of ser-84 in the end of the
d-helix of cntnc and the two methyls of the isopropyl group on
 xxxd318xxx  were observed. due to a lack of unambiguous noe
correlations involving the pyrrolidine ring and the isopropyl
group with the protein, those two parts of  xxxd318xxx  are not as
well defined as the aromatic rings in the ternary structure (fig.
2). when the heavy atoms of  xxxd318xxx  are superimpose onto the
average structure in the ternary complex, the average r.m.s.d.
values for the benzyl and phenyl groups are 0.9 ⫾ 0.2 å,
whereas that for the pyrrolidine ring and the isopropyl group is
3 ⫾ 1 å. interestingly, we also identified a noe between the
h9# and h10# (degenerate) protons in the pyrrolidine ring of
 xxxd318xxx  and the n terminus residue arg-147 of ctni147–163
(illustrated in fig. 2c). because arg-147 is positively charged
and the nitrogen in the pyrrolidine ring is partially positively
charged at neutral ph, the two moieties repel each other to
create a hindrance effect. as a result, the two ligands reorient
their positions slightly relative to those in the binary
cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163 or the cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠bepridil complex
to accommodate each other in the hydrophobic pocket of
cntnc䡠ca2⫹ (see below).
structure of ctni147–163 in the ternary complex—in the
structure of the cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163 binary complex published previously, there were no intramolecular noe restraints
observed and the secondary structure was solely based on the
chemical shift index (13). in the present structure, 24 intramolecular noes, including 3 dnn and 6 d␣n(i,i⫹3) (the hallmark
of a helical structure) restraints for the 17-residue ctni147–163
peptide were assigned. as a result, the peptide is slightly better
defined in the present structure. in the ensemble of solution
structures (fig. 2a), the backbone atoms of the 17 residues
superimpose onto the average peptide structure with an
r.m.s.d. of 1.5 å as compared with that of 2.0 å in the
cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163 binary complex. however, if only the
␣-helical region (residues 150 –156) is compared, the backbone

from any contacts with cntnc. the overall effect is that the
n-terminal of the peptide is shifted slightly away from the hydrophobic pocket of cntnc, likely due to both the steric hindrance with  xxxd318xxx  and repelling force between the n terminus
of the peptide and the pyrrolidine group of  xxxd318xxx . similarly,
when the nad unit of cntnc in cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163䡠bepridil
superimpose onto the nad unit of cntnc in cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠
 xxxd318xxx , the bc unit moved up 6 ⫾ 1 å (fig. 5b). this change is
also reflected in the a/b and c/d interhelical angle changes (see
above and table iii). in the present structure, the strong contacts
between the hydrophobic residues in cntnc and the two aromatic rings of  xxxd318xxx  serve as the primary anchoring site for this
molecule in the hydrophobic core of the protein. the pyrrolidine
and isopropyl groups protrude toward the outside. this is similar
to the binding of  xxxd318xxx  in the x-ray structure of cntnc䡠
ca2⫹䡠bepridil. it appears that the  xxxd318xxx  molecule reorients
itself to accommodate ctni147–163 and minimizes both the steric
hindrance with the peptide and the repelling force between the n
terminus of the peptide and the pyrrolidine group of  xxxd318xxx . as
a result, the phenyl ring of  xxxd318xxx  in the ternary structure has
a similar conformation and binding site as that of  xxxd318xxx  in
the ctnc䡠ca2⫹䡠bepridil structure, but the aromatic ring of the
benzyl group has shifted (4.7 ⫾ 0.7 å) its position closer to the
a-helix of cntnc, which pulls the a-helix down to accommodate ctni147–163 and resulted in a more closed structure for

cntnc. the isopropyl group has also showed a small movement, but this movement is not well defined due to a lack of
unambiguous noes involving the isopropyl group.
in summary, the clashing between the ctni147–163 peptide
and  xxxd318xxx  in the cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163䡠bepridil ternary
complex makes the two ligands reorient their positions relative
to those in the cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163 or cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠bepridil
complexes. the consequence is a less stable open conformation
for cntnc in the ternary complex than in the binary complexes. this clashing helps to explain the apparent weaker
binding of  xxxd318xxx  to the ctnc regulatory domain in the
ctnc䡠ctni complex than in ctnc alone (21) and the observed
negative cooperativity between ctni147–163 and beprdil in this
work. this may in part explain the poor pharmacological effects
of  xxxd318xxx  in heart failure (39).
relevance to the future design of ctnc-specific pharmacological agents for the treatment of heart disease—despite
many medical advances, heart disease remains the leading
cause of death in western society. the role of myofilament
contractile proteins in heart disease is just beginning to be
recognized. many identified cardiac dysfunctions are associated with the changes in the myofilament response to ca2⫹ as
well as altered myofilament structures (for reviews, see refs.
16, 40, 41). studies on the structure and function of myofilament proteins have contributed a great deal to the understand-

ing of the molecular mechanism of cardiac muscle contraction,
because the information has been exploited to develop possible
therapeutic intervention and diagnostics. for example, the release of  xxxg2309xxx  from the heart is now used clinically as a key
indicator of myocardial ischemia (42). ischemia and other cardiovascular conditions are also associated with changes in  xxxg2309xxx 
phosphorylation state (43). work in transgenic animals has
shown that removal of 17 amino acids at the c terminus of  xxxg2309xxx 
is sufficient to produce myocardial stunning (44). moreover,
multiple mutations on the myofilament proteins have been
associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, one of
the most frequently occurring inherited cardiac disorders, affecting up to 1 in 500 of the population (40).
targeting the myofilaments for designing new drugs remains an important objective in the development of experimental tools and inotropic agents. as the ca2⫹-binding component
in the myofilament of cardiac muscle, ctnc is an attractive
target for the design of cardiotonic drugs, which may be used to
modulate the altered ca2⫹ response of the myofilaments in
diseased heart. for example, a group of so-called ca2⫹ sensitizers has been developed. these drugs have been shown to
increase the myocardial contractility by generating more force
for a given amount of cytosolic free ca2⫹ (for reviews, see refs.
45– 47). in fact, we have shown that a ca2⫹ sensitizer, emd
57033, interacts with the c-domain of ctnc without interfering
with the interaction between ctnc and the inhibitory region of
 xxxg2309xxx  (36, 48). it is important to put the results of this study into
perspective with respect to the design of ca2⫹ sensitizers. in
fig. 6, we summarized the effects of ca2⫹, ctni147–163, and
 xxxd318xxx  on cntnc. ca2⫹ binding to cntnc induces little structural change but sets the stage for ctni147–163 binding (a to b).
a large closed to open conformational transition occurs in
cntnc䡠ca2⫹ upon binding ctni147–163 (b to d) or  xxxd318xxx  (b to
c). despite the simultaneous presence of the two ligands that
are capable of inducing the opening of cntnc䡠ca2⫹, the domain
is, in fact, more closed than if either one of the ligands was
complexed to cntnc䡠ca2⫹ alone. this is the result of the negative cooperativity and the clashing between the two ligands,
as discussed earlier. ideally, a ca2⫹ sensitizer would increase
the ca2⫹-binding affinity of ctnc and enhance the ctnc- xxxg2309xxx 
interaction, corresponding to driving the equilibrium to the
right (fig. 6, from a to b to c/d to e). clearly,  xxxd318xxx  itself is
not an ideal ca2⫹ sensitizer because it decreases the binding
affinity of ctni147–163 for cntnc䡠ca2⫹. to avoid such an inhibitory effect, neutral agents resembling  xxxd318xxx  could be designed to enhance the ctnc- xxxg2309xxx  interactions. on the other
hand,  xxxd318xxx  itself or agents resembling  xxxd318xxx  could be used
as a ca2⫹ desensitizer. these agents would be beneficial for the
treatment of many cardiac dysfunctions associated with increased ca2⫹ sensitivity and increased contractility as well as
impairment of diastolic relaxation such as in certain cases of
familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (41). thus, although  xxxd318xxx  by itself is not a good pharmacological agent for heart
failure (39), the current high resolution nmr solution structure of the cntnc䡠ca2⫹䡠ctni147–163䡠bepridil ternary complex
provides a structural basis into the features that may be important for the design of ctnc-specific cardiotonic drugs.
