nflammasomes activate  xxxg340xxx  for processing
and secretion of the cytokines interleukin-1 (il-1)
and il-18.  xxxg1567xxx / xxxg1567xxx / xxxg1567xxx  is an essential
component of inflammasomes triggered by microbial
ligands, danger-associated molecular patterns (damps),
and crystals. inappropriate  xxxg1567xxx  activity has been
incriminated in the pathogenesis of gouty arthritis,
alzheimer’s, and silicosis. therefore, inhibitors of the
 xxxg1567xxx  inflammasome offer considerable therapeutic
promise. in this study, we show that the type 2 diabetes
drug  xxxd2215xxx  prevented activation of the  xxxg1567xxx 
inflammasome.  xxxd2215xxx ’s cyclohexylurea group, which
binds to adenosine triphosphatase (atp)–sensitive k+
(katp) channels for insulin secretion, is dispensable for

inflammasome inhibition. macrophages lacking katp
subunits or atp-binding cassette transporters also activate the  xxxg1567xxx  inflammasome normally.  xxxd2215xxx 
analogues inhibit atp- but not hypothermia-induced
il-1 secretion from human monocytes expressing
familial cold-associated autoinflammatory syndrome–
associated  xxxg1567xxx  mutations, thus suggesting that
inhibition occurs upstream of  xxxg1567xxx . concurrent
with the role of  xxxg1567xxx  in endotoxemia,  xxxd2215xxx 
significantly delays lipopolysaccharide-induced lethality in mice. therefore,  xxxd2215xxx  is the first identified
compound to prevent  xxxg1567xxx  activation and microbial
ligand-, damp-, and crystal-induced il-1 secretion.

 xxxd2215xxx  is the most widely used sulfonylurea drug for the
treatment of type 2 diabetes in the united states (riddle, 2003).
the drug works by inhibiting atp-sensitive k+ (katp) channels
in pancreatic  cells (ashcroft, 2005). katp channels are octameric complexes of four kir6.x (kir6.1 or  xxxg1250xxx ) and four
sulfonylurea receptor (sur;  xxxg19xxx  or  xxxg20xxx ) subunits (clement
et al., 1997). the sur subunits belong to the atp-binding cassette (abc) transporter family (aguilar-bryan et al., 1995) and
function as a regulatory subunit, endowing the kir6.x channel
with sensitivity to inhibition by sulfonylureas such as  xxxd2215xxx 
and  xxxd2204xxx  (ashcroft, 2005). in addition to katp channels, the
 xxxg22xxx   xxxg9xxx  was proposed as a putative  xxxd2215xxx

in this study, we show that  xxxd2215xxx  prevented activation of
the  xxxg1567xxx  inflammasome by a variety of stimuli. concurrent
with the role of  xxxg1567xxx  in endotoxemia,  xxxd2215xxx  delayed lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced lethality in mice. therefore,  xxxd2215xxx  is the first compound identified to act upstream of  xxxg1567xxx

 xxxd2215xxx  prevents lps+atp-induced secretion of il-1 from
human and murine macrophages (hamon et al., 1997; laliberte
et al., 1999; perregaux et al., 2001) and from murine schwann
cells (marty et al., 2005). to determine whether  xxxg340xxx  activation is impaired by  xxxd2215xxx , lps-primed bone marrow–
derived macrophages (bmdms) were incubated with  xxxd2215xxx 
for 15 min before atp was added for another 30 min. in contrast to the related sulfonylurea  xxxd2204xxx ,  xxxd2215xxx  inhibited
 xxxg340xxx  processing in a dose-dependent fashion (fig. 1 a),
and this prevented secretion of the  xxxg340xxx –dependent cytokines il-1 (fig. 1 b) and il-18 (fig. 1 c). secretion of il-6
(fig. 1 d) and tnf (fig. 1 e) was not impaired by  xxxd2215xxx ,
ruling out a general defect in macrophage responsiveness.
inhibition was evident up to 3 h post-atp (fig. s1 b), indicating that  xxxd2215xxx  did not merely delay  xxxg340xxx  activation.
significantly, bmdms cultured for 3 h in  xxxd2215xxx ,  xxxd2204xxx , or dmso looked morphologically normal (fig. 1 f) and
displayed no significant membrane damage (fig. s1 c). as a positive control, macrophage death was induced with the calmodulin
inhibitor calmidazolium (fig. 1 f and fig. s1 c). inhibition of
 xxxg340xxx  activation by  xxxd2215xxx  was reversible because  xxxg340xxx 
was activated if  xxxd2215xxx  was removed from the culture medium
before atp addition (fig. s1 d).  xxxd2215xxx  also blocked the rapid,
 xxxg340xxx –dependent cell death that occurs when bmdms are
treated with lps and atp (fig. 1, g–i). as expected,  xxxd2204xxx 
and dmso did not prevent this death. of note, neither lps nor
atp alone affected bmdm viability (fig. 1 h). like  xxxg340xxx /
bmdms, cells lacking the p2x7 receptor or  xxxg1567xxx  were not
killed by lps+atp (fig. 1 i). these results demonstrate that the
 xxxg1567xxx  inflammasome is essential for lps+atp-induced
macrophage death and that  xxxd2215xxx  inhibits lps+atp-induced
 xxxg340xxx  activation, il-1 secretion, and macrophage death.

channels. interestingly, the cyclohexylurea group (fig. 2 a, compound g1) was dispensable for inhibition of lps+atp-induced
 xxxg340xxx  activation (fig. 2 b) and il-1 secretion (fig. 2 c).
as expected,  xxxd2215xxx  and compound g1 did not affect il-6
secretion (fig. 2 d).  xxxd2204xxx  also contains a cyclohexylurea
group (fig. 2 a) and inhibits  xxxg19xxx -containing katp channels,
but it failed to inhibit  xxxg340xxx  activation (fig. 2 b). these
data suggest that inhibition of the  xxxg1567xxx  inflammasome is
independent of  xxxg19xxx -containing katp channels.
additional structure activity experiments demonstrated that
both the benzamido and sulfonyl groups of  xxxd2215xxx  (fig. 2 a,
compounds g2–g4) were required for optimal inhibition.
analogue g2 comprising only the benzamido group (fig. 2 a,
compound g2) inhibited lps+atp-induced  xxxg340xxx  activation (fig. 2 e) and il-1 secretion (fig. 2 f), albeit less effectively than compound g1. thus, the benzamido group contributes
but is not sufficient for optimal inhibition. indeed, a g1 analogue lacking the benzamido group (fig. 2 a, compound g3)
did not affect  xxxg340xxx  activation and il-1 secretion (fig. 2,
e and f). in addition to the benzamido group, the sulfonyl moiety is required for optimal inhibition, as deletion of the sulfonyl
group from compound g1 (fig. 2 a, compound g4) was less
effective at inhibiting  xxxg340xxx  activation and il-1 secretion
(fig. 2, e and f). like  xxxd2215xxx , compounds g1–g4 permitted
normal il-6 secretion (fig. 2 g), demonstrating the specificity
of these results.
 xxxd2215xxx  inhibits the  xxxg1567xxx 
inflammasome downstream of the
p2x7 receptor

like atp, the cation ionophore nigericin engages the  xxxg1567xxx 
inflammasome (mariathasan et al., 2006), but nigericin signals
independently of the p2x7 receptor (fig. s1, e–g; solle et al.,
2001).  xxxd2215xxx  potently blocked lps+nigericin-induced
 xxxg340xxx  activation (fig. 3 a). as expected,  xxxd2204xxx  and dmso
vehicle did not prevent lps+nigericin-induced  xxxg340xxx  activation. notably, substituting lipid a, lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan, or pam3-csk4 for lps did not prevent  xxxd2215xxx  from
inhibiting  xxxg340xxx  activation (fig. 3 b).
in agreement with previous studies (cassel et al., 2008;
dostert et al., 2008; hornung et al., 2008), silica and the lyso­
somotrophic molecule h-ll-ome also promoted cryopyrindependent  xxxg340xxx  activation and il-1 secretion in lps-primed
bmdms (fig. s2, a and b).  xxxg340xxx  activation and il-1
secretion in response to these stimuli were independent of the
p2x7 receptor (fig. s2, c and d) but required tlr4 signaling
(fig. s2 e).  xxxd2215xxx  effectively blocked  xxxg340xxx  activation
and il-1 secretion by these stimuli too (fig. 3, c and d).
these data suggest that  xxxd2215xxx  targets a signaling component
downstream of the p2x7 receptor. we first considered the hemichannel  xxxg1664xxx , which was proposed to signal both lps+atpand lps+nigericin-induced  xxxg340xxx  activation (pelegrin and

surprenant, 2006, 2007; kanneganti et al., 2007).  xxxg1664xxx  forms
a nonselective pore for molecules <1 kd, such as the fluorescent dye
yopro-1, within seconds to minutes of p2x7 receptor stimulation
(pelegrin and surprenant, 2006, 2007; locovei et al., 2007). unlike
the p2x7 receptor inhibitor kn-62,  xxxd2215xxx  did not prevent atpinduced yopro-1 uptake into lps-primed macrophages (fig. 3 e),
suggesting that  xxxg1664xxx  is not inhibited by  xxxd2215xxx . concurrently,  xxxd2215xxx  inhibited  xxxg340xxx  activation by lps+dotap
(fig. 3 f), a stimulus that engages the  xxxg1567xxx  inflammasome independently of the p2x7 receptor and  xxxg1664xxx  (kanneganti et al.,
2007). collectively, these results indicate that  xxxd2215xxx  inhibits engagement of the  xxxg1567xxx  inflammasome by diverse stimuli and
that inhibition occurs downstream of the p2x7 receptor (fig. 3 g).

the structure–activity relationship experiments (fig. 2) suggest
that  xxxd2215xxx  inhibits the  xxxg1567xxx  inflammasome independently of  xxxg19xxx -containing katp channels. certain tissues such
as heart and muscle express  xxxg20xxx  instead of  xxxg19xxx  katp channels. however,  xxxg20xxx / bmdms activated  xxxg340xxx  and secreted normal amounts of il-1 in response to lps+atp and
lps+nigericin (fig. 4, a and b). in addition, bmdms from
kir6.1/ and  xxxg1250xxx / mice also demonstrated normal lps+atpand lps+nigericin-induced  xxxg340xxx  activation (fig. 4 c) and
il-1 secretion (fig. 4 d). these results show that katp channels
are not required for activation of the  xxxg1567xxx  inflammasome.
previous studies also suggested that  xxxd2215xxx  and the abc
transporter inhibitor dids (4,4-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2disulfonic acid disodium) target  xxxg9xxx  to inhibit lps+atpinduced il-1 secretion (hamon et al., 1997; marty et al.,
2005). we confirmed that dids inhibited lps+atp-induced
il-1 secretion in a dose-dependent manner (fig. s3 a). however, dids also inhibited p2x7 receptor-mediated currents
(ma et al., 2009) and  xxxg340xxx  activation (fig. s3 b), suggesting
that the drug prevents il-1 secretion by directly antagonizing
the p2x7 receptor rather than  xxxg9xxx . concurrently, bmdms
from mice lacking  xxxg9xxx  and/or  xxxg21xxx  activated  xxxg340xxx 
normally in response to lps+atp and lps+nigericin (fig. 4 e).
 xxxg340xxx  activation also was normal in macrophages lacking
the  xxxd2215xxx  receptor  xxxg437xxx  (unpublished data).
to complement these experiments, we analyzed whether
 xxxd2215xxx  prevented  xxxg340xxx  activation in macrophages lacking
abc transporters or katp channels. as in wild-type macrophages
(fig. 1 a),  xxxd2215xxx  abolished lps+atp- and lps+nigericininduced  xxxg340xxx  activation in macrophages lacking  xxxg9xxx  and
 xxxg21xxx  (fig. 4 f) or the  xxxg1253xxx  subunits kir6.1 (fig. 4 g)
and  xxxg1250xxx  (fig. 4 h). in summary, these experiments indicate
that known targets of  xxxd2215xxx  are dispensable for activation of
the  xxxg1567xxx  inflammasome.

(mariathasan et al., 2004). interestingly,  xxxg340xxx  activation in
s. typhimurium–infected bmdms was not affected by  xxxd2215xxx 
(fig. 5 a). furthermore, anthrax lethal toxin, which engages the
nalp1b inflammasome (boyden and dietrich, 2006), also activated  xxxg340xxx  normally in the presence of  xxxd2215xxx  (fig. 5 b).
concurrently,  xxxd2215xxx  did not affect  xxxg340xxx  activity in vitro
(fig. 5 c). these data suggest that  xxxd2215xxx  works upstream of
 xxxg340xxx  and asc, the shared adaptor in the  xxxg1567xxx , ipaf,
and nalp1b inflammasomes (fig. 3 g).
we next studied the affect of  xxxd2215xxx  and compound
g1 on the atpase activity of  xxxg1567xxx , which is required for
 xxxg340xxx  activation and il-1 secretion (duncan et al., 2007).
neither  xxxd2215xxx  nor compound g1 reduced the atpase activity
of recombinant  xxxg1567xxx  (fig. 5, d and e; and fig. s3, c and d),
placing  xxxd2215xxx  action upstream of  xxxg1567xxx . we sought
confirmatory evidence using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) from individuals afflicted with familial
cold-associated autoinflammatory syndrome ( xxxg1567xxx ), a disorder
resulting from a temperature-sensitive (l353p) mutation within
 xxxg1567xxx  (hoffman et al., 2001). similar to lps+atp at 37°c,
cold-induced conformational changes in  xxxg1567xxx  monocytes are
presumed to assemble the  xxxg1567xxx  inflammasome at the permissive temperature of 32°c. it is worth noting that  xxxg1567xxx  monocytes secreted a small amount of il-1 at 37°c in response to either
atp or lps alone (fig. s3 e), suggesting that  xxxg1567xxx  monocytes
are hyperresponsive. compound g1 inhibited lps+atp-induced
il-1 secretion at 37 and 32°c (fig. 5 f and not depicted) but
did not prevent cold-induced il-1 secretion from  xxxg1567xxx  pbmcs
at 32°c (fig. 5 g). therefore, compound g1 and  xxxd2215xxx  likely
act upstream of  xxxg1567xxx  in inhibiting  xxxg340xxx  activation. we
also assessed the affect of  xxxd2215xxx  on lps-induced lethality in
mice based on the observation that  xxxg1567xxx -deficient mice are
resistant to lps-induced lethality (mariathasan et al., 2006;
sutterwala et al., 2006). although 90% of vehicle-treated mice
died within 20 h after lps dosage, all mice in the  xxxd2215xxx -treated
group were alive at this time point (fig. 5 h). mortality in the
 xxxd2215xxx -treated arm was significantly delayed (p < 0.0001), but in
line with  xxxd2215xxx ’s relatively short half-life in vivo (1 h; unpublished data), the mice eventually succumbed to endotoxic shock.
collectively, these results demonstrate that  xxxd2215xxx  acts
upstream of  xxxg1567xxx  and downstream of the p2x7 receptor to
block  xxxg1567xxx -dependent inflammasome activation by pamps,
damps, and crystalline substances. these results may have
significant therapeutic ramifications for the treatment of gouty
arthritis, silicosis, and alzheimer’s, in which excessive  xxxg1567xxx -dependent il-1 production was proposed as a major
cause of pathology (cassel et al., 2008; dostert et al., 2008;
halle et al., 2008; hornung et al., 2008).

were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at
genentech. bmdms were prepared as described previously (lamkanfi et al.,
2007). in brief, bmdms were isolated from femurs of 6–12-wk-old mice and
were cultured in iscove’s modified dulbecco’s medium containing 10% heatinactivated fbs, 20% l cell–conditioned medium, 100 u/ml penicillin, and
100 mg/ml streptomycin at 37°c in a humidified atmosphere containing 5%
co2. after 5–7 d of incubation, cells were collected and plated in 6- or 24well plates in iscove’s modified dulbecco’s medium containing 10% heatinactivated fbs and 100 mg/ml thymidine and antibiotics. macrophages
were cultured for an additional 24 h before use.
lps-induced endotoxemia
8-wk-old male c57bl/6 mice (charles river) were maintained in microisolator cages and received food and water ad libitum according to the
american association of laboratory animal care guidelines. mice were randomly divided into two groups (n = 10/group). the mice were injected
intraperitoneally bid daily with 500 mg/kg  xxxd2215xxx  or the formulation vehicle
(dmso/10% hp-b-cd [2.5:97.5]) in 360 µl pbs. 4 h after the first dosing,
endotoxic shock was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 18 mg/kg lps
(escherichia coli o111:b4; sigma-aldrich). mice were monitored hourly
for survival up to 36 h. differences in group survival were analyzed with
the kaplan–meier test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

preparation of human adherent monocytes
venous blood was drawn into edta/vacutainer tubes (bd) early in the
morning when  xxxg1567xxx  patients are generally least symptomatic. pbmc fractions were collected and resuspended in serum-free media and transferred
to 24-well plates at a concentration of 1 × 106/ml. cells were incubated
for 4 h at 37°c, and nonadherent cells were removed leaving adherent
monocytes as previously described (rosengren et al., 2007).
bacteria, ligands, and inhibitors
s. enterica serovar typhimurium strain sl1344 was provided by d. monack
(stanford university, palo alto, ca). single colonies were inoculated into
3 ml of brain-heart infusion medium and grown overnight at 30°c with
shaking. anthrax lethal factor and protective antigen (list biological laboratories) were used  xxxd1891xxx  µg/ml. ultrapure lps, lipid a, lipoteichoic acid,
peptidoglycan, and pam3-csk4 (invivogen) were used  xxxd1891xxx  µg/ml. atp
(roche) was used at 5 mm, and nigericin (sigma-aldrich) was used at a
final concentration of 20 µm.  xxxd2215xxx ,  xxxd2204xxx , and calmidazolium
were obtained from sigma-aldrich and used at the indicated concentrations. compounds g1–g4 were purchased from ryan scientific. dotap
was obtained from roche and used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. silicia (min-u-sil 5) was provided by us silica, and h-ll-ome
was purchased from chem-impex international. infection and stimulation of
bmdms were performed as described in figs. 1–5.
microscopy
bright-field and fluorescence microscopy were performed in culture media
at room temperature under a long-distance plan neofluar 20×/0.4 ph2
korr objective (carl zeiss, inc.) on a microscope (axiovert 200m; carl zeiss,
inc.) equipped with a charge-coupled device digital camera (axiocam;
carl zeiss, inc.) and axiovision software (rel.4.6; carl zeiss, inc.). for
dye uptake assays, 2 µm yopro-1 (invitrogen) was present 10 min before
macrophages were stimulated with atp for 5 min. fluorescence signals in
digital black and white fluorographs were artificially colored green with

cytokines, antibodies, and western blotting
human and mouse cytokines in culture supernatants were measured by
enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (r&d systems) and luminex assay.
data were analyzed with student’s t test, and p < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant. the  xxxg340xxx  antibody used for western blotting
was raised against recombinant mouse  xxxg340xxx  and was used as described previously (lamkanfi et al., 2007). in brief, immunoblots were incubated overnight with the  xxxg340xxx  antibody (1:1,000), and a goat
anti–rabbit secondary antibody (jackson immunoresearch laboratories,
inc.) was used to detect proteins by enhanced chemiluminescence (thermo
fisher scientific).
in vitro  xxxg340xxx  activity assay
in vitro  xxxg340xxx  activity was determined by incubating 1 iu recombinant mouse  xxxg340xxx  (biovision) with 50 mm fluorogenic  xxxg340xxx 
substrate peptide ac-wehd-amc in 200 ml cfs buffer (10 mm hepes,
ph 7.4, 220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 2 mm nacl, 2.5 mm kh2po4,
0.5 mm egta, 2 mm mgcl2, 0.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.5 mm l-glutamine,
and 10 mm dtt). the release of fluorescent  xxxd1047xxx 
in the presence of the indicated concentrations of  xxxd2215xxx ,  xxxd2204xxx , or
the  xxxg340xxx  inhibitor ac-yvad- xxxg478xxx  was measured for 30 min at 1-min
intervals by fluorometry (excitation at 360 nm and emission at 480 nm) on
a cytofluor (perseptive biosystems), and the maximal rate of increase in
fluorescence was calculated (f/min).

patients
the university of california san diego human research protection program committee approved this study, and informed consent was obtained
from all subjects. three related patients with  xxxg1567xxx  (l353p mutation) and
five normal controls were included. the  xxxg1567xxx  patients had a classical clinical presentation, met diagnostic criteria, and were being treated with
 xxxd3120xxx , an il-1 inhibitor approved by the food and drug administration, but held their dose for >2 wk before the experiment.

photoshop (adobe). macrophage membrane damage was measured with
a live/dead assay (invitrogen).

atpase assay
atp hydrolysis was measured by visualizing the conversion of -[32p]atp to
-[32p]adp using tlc. a total of 5 µl purified  xxxg1567xxx -flag was incubated
with 0.1 µm -[32p]atp (3,000 ci/mmol; perkinelmer) in a total volume of
20 µl reaction buffer (25 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5, 150 mm nacl, 10 mm
mgcl2, 1 mm dtt, 1 mm edta, and edta-free complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets) containing 100 µm  xxxd2215xxx , compound g1,  xxxd2204xxx , or vehicle control (dmso) for 2 h. the reaction was quenched by
adding an equal volume of tlc development solvent (1 m  xxxd2154xxx  and
0.5 m licl). a total of 2 µl reaction mixture was spotted on a polyethylene­
imine cellulose tlc plate and developed with 1 m  xxxd2154xxx  with 0.5 m
licl in a tlc chamber. the tlc plate was exposed to x-ray film or used for
quantification with a phosphoimager (typhoon trio; ge healthcare).
online supplemental material
fig. s1 shows that lps+atp-induced  xxxg340xxx  activation and macrophage
death are  xxxd2215xxx  sensitive and, unlike lps+nigericin, require the p2x7
receptor. fig. s2 shows that lps+h-ll-ome– and lps+silica-induced  xxxg340xxx  activation and il-1 secretion require  xxxg1567xxx  and tlr4 but not
the p2x7 receptor. fig. s3 shows inhibition of  xxxg340xxx  activation by
dids, immunopurification of recombinant  xxxg1567xxx -flag, and il-1 secretion from  xxxg1567xxx  monocytes. online supplemental material is available at
