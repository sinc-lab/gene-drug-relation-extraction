emerging new therapeutic options for the management of
opioid induced constipation
shailendra kapoor
the recent article by candrilli et al. regarding
the impact of induced constipation was highly
interesting.1 the authors have clearly demonstrated the various ways in which iatrogenic
constipation affects patients on “chronic therapy
for the purpose of pain control.” interestingly,
the past few months have seen the development
of novel new pharmacological combinations as
well as novel new agents that have shown a
marked response rate in reducing the incidence
of opiate-induced constipation.
for instance, clinical use of oxycodone–
extended release in conjunction with naloxone
is a novel new biochemical development that
has been shown to significantly decrease the incidence as well as prevalence of opiate-induced
constipation.2 in fact, a pharmacological ratio
of 2:1 has been found to be most effective and
successful in decreasing the incidence of constipation in comparison to when oxycodone is used
alone.3
similarly, the effectiveness of subcutaneous  xxxd2614xxx  in ameliorating opioidinduced constipation has been proved beyond
doubt.4 in fact, slatkin et al. in a recent study
have reported that following a single dose of

0.3 mg/kg of  xxxd2614xxx , “laxation” was
noted in 58% of the patients within 4 hours of administration of the subcutaneous dose.5 thirtyfive percent of the patients who do not respond
successfully after administration of the first dose
usually respond after a second administration of
the injection.6 what appears more important is
that  xxxd2614xxx  in appropriate doses does
not significantly mitigate the analgesic effects
of opiates.5 in fact, lesser rates of usage of laxative for induced constipation purposes in individuals with terminal and advanced illnesses
have been noted following the regular use of
 xxxd2614xxx .6
another emerging alternative in this scenario is the emergence of the  xxxg472xxx  activator
 xxxd2513xxx .7 in fact, the food and drug administration recently approved the clinical use
of  xxxd2513xxx  for the management and amelioration of symptoms associated with chronic
constipation.8
the magnitude of opiate-induced constipation is confirmed by the recent probe1 study,
which showed that nearly 81% of patients on
opiate therapy have constipation.9 given this
high incidence of opiate-induced constipation,

there is a clear need that pain management physicians address this side effect in patients on opioid therapy. there is a clear and urgent need to
increase awareness among pain specialists regarding medications such as methyl naltrexone,
which may go a long way in decreasing the incidence of opiate-induced constipation.
