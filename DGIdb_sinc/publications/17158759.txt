abstract
differential signalling between the two  xxxg730xxx  (er) isoforms in the presence of tamoxifen
has been described. we hypothesise that differential recruitment of the steroid receptor co-activator,
 xxxg1512xxx  to er-a and er-b may in part explain associations between er isoforms and response to
endocrine treatment.  xxxg1512xxx  was localised within epithelial cells of breast tumour tissue and was
co-localised with er-a and er-b, (nz112). expression of  xxxg1512xxx  was found to be positively
associated with er-a (pz0.0021) and inversely with er-b (p!0.0001). uniquely, this study utilises
primary cell cultures derived from patient tumours, thus providing samples not readily available in
most molecular model systems. these samples have enabled us to investigate the influence of
growth factor pathways on steroid receptor-co-activator interactions. in her2 (human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2) positive primary tumour cell cultures 17b-estradiol induced a decrease in
 xxxg1512xxx , whereas upregulated  xxxg1512xxx  expression. furthermore, treatment with tamoxifen-induced
 xxxg1512xxx  recruitment to the er-oestrogen response element and enhanced interaction between  xxxg1512xxx 
and er-a, but not er-b. knockdown of  xxxg1512xxx  results in a concomitant loss of expression of the
oestrogen target gene ps2. furthermore, silencing of  xxxg1512xxx  resensitizes endocrine resistant, her2
positive cells to the anti-proliferative effects of tamoxifen. the ability of er-a, but not er-b to recruit
 xxxg1512xxx  in the presence of tamoxifen may in part explain the differential er isoform associations with
recurrence in human breast cancer.

introduction
breast cancer continues to affect one in ten women in
the western world and despite the phenomenal
advances in recent years, the mortality rate still
remains at around 35%. oestrogen receptors (er)
play a pivotal role in normal breast development and in
the initiation and progression of breast cancer, hence,
disruption of er function is the main therapeutic
strategy employed in targeting the disease. the er is
encoded for by two genes, er-a and er-b. variation

between the different er isoforms transcriptional
activation and in vivo tumour formation, in response
to 17b-estradiol and tamoxifen has been described
(paech et al. 1997, paruthiyil et al. 2004). this has led
to the hypothesis that each isoform may play distinct
roles in tumour progression. studies at an mrna level
have associated er-b with disease progression (speirs
et al. 1999), however, er-b protein levels have been
related to a positive response to endocrine therapy and
increased disease-free survival (mann et al. 2001,
fleming et al. 2004a, myers et al. 2004).

m mc ilroy, f j fleming et al.: er– xxxg1512xxx  interactions in human breast cancer
many breast cancer tumours that are initially
responsive to endocrine therapy will develop acquired
resistance after prolonged treatment with tamoxifen
whilst others display de novo resistance (schiff &
osborne 2005). tamoxifen has a tissue specific
agonist/antagonist profile, which is thought to be due
in part, to the presence of er coregulatory proteins. in
particular, the steroid receptor-co-activator,  xxxg1512xxx 
( xxxg1512xxx ,  xxxg1512xxx ,  xxxg1512xxx ,  xxxg1512xxx  and  xxxg1512xxx ) is
documented to enhance the oestrogen agonist properties of tamoxifen in vitro (smith et al. 1997).  xxxg1512xxx 
has been implicated in breast tumourigenesis with
reports of gene amplification frequencies and increased
levels of both  xxxg1512xxx  mrna and protein in breast
cancer (anzick et al. 1997, list et al. 2001, hudelist et
al. 2003).  xxxg1512xxx  is an important er-a co-activator and
has been reported to display oncogenic properties when
overexpressed in a transgenic model (torres-arzayus
et al. 2004), in contrast, disruption of the  xxxg1512xxx  gene
in mice, results in a diverse phenotype with abnormal
reproductive function and mammary gland growth
retardation (xu et al. 2000). the importance of  xxxg1512xxx 
in regulating er function is further illustrated by its
mediation of agonist but not antagonist-induced
degradation of er-a. thus loss of  xxxg1512xxx  will affect
er-a-regulated signalling by both inhibiting
degradation of the receptor and subsequent quenching
of transcriptional initiation (shao et al. 2004).
there is now substantial evidence of crosstalk
between the er and growth factor receptor signalling
pathways. her2, a member of the epidermal
growth factor receptor family has been implicated in
de novo endocrine resistance in studies where mcf7
breast cancer cells are engineered to overexpress
her2 (shou et al. 2004). crosstalk between er and
this receptor has been shown to result in phosphorylation of  xxxg1512xxx  thereby enhancing co-activator activity
(font de mora & brown 2000). in a study of breast
cancer patients, high levels of both  xxxg1512xxx  and her2
protein have been associated with tamoxifen resistance
(osborne et al. 2003).
data presented here supports the hypothesis that era specific recruitment of  xxxg1512xxx  in the presence
of tamoxifen may contribute to differential associations
between er isoforms and response to endocrine
therapy. we provide evidence of this using ex vivo
breast tumours from patients undergoing surgery
for the removal of histologically confirmed breast
cancer. it was found that tamoxifen-liganded er-a, but
not er-b, can bind  xxxg1512xxx  in the presence of her2.
furthermore, resensitization of endocrine resistant
cells to tamoxifen by silencing  xxxg1512xxx  provides
conclusive verification for the importance of
1136

co-activator recruitment in her2 positive recurrent
breast cancer.

materials and methods
patient selection

following ethical approval, 112 breast carcinomas from
patients undergoing surgery and six specimens of
histologically normal breast tissue from patients undergoing reduction mammoplasties were examined. patients
were selected on the basis of those, who received
tamoxifen only as adjuvant therapy after surgery. all
patients had stage i–ii breast cancer at presentation and
were assessed by abdominal ultrasound, chest x-ray and
bone scintigraphy before surgery. her2 status was
evaluated using the dako (glostrup, denmark) herceptest immunocytochemical assay. scoring was
assessed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. a
score was assigned according to the intensity and pattern
of cell membrane staining: 0 to c1zno staining or
staining in !10% of cells; c2zweak to moderate
staining in o10% of cells; c3zstrong staining in o10%
of cells. in tumour samples scoring c2 with the hercept
test; her2 status was confirmed by fluorescent in situ
hybridization using the vysis kit (abbot laboratories,
illinois, il, usa) according to manufacturers’
instructions.
immunohistochemistry

 xxxg1512xxx  was detected within the archival paraffinembedded breast tumour specimens. sections were
incubated with rabbit anti-human  xxxg1512xxx  (1 mg/ml)
(sc-13066, santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca,
usa) followed by corresponding biotin-labelled
secondary antibody (1:2000) using the vectastain
elite kit (vector labs, burlingame, ca, usa)
according to the manufacturers instructions.  xxxg1512xxx 
was detected using 3, 3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and counterstained with haematoxylin.
negative controls were performed using matched igg
controls (dako). immunostained slides were scored
using the allred scoring system (harvey et al. 1999).
two independent observers without knowledge of
prognostic factors scored the slides.
clinico-pathological parameters

variables analysed included tumour size, tumour grade
and auxiliary node status. a recurrence was defined as
any local (chest wall) or systemic recurrence during the
follow-up period.

statistical analysis

statistical analysis was carried out using the fishers
exact test for categorical variables. two-sided
p-values of !0.05 were considered to be statistically
significant.
immunofluorescent microscopy

breast cancer sections were blocked in goat serum,
incubated with mouse anti-human er-a (10 mg/ml in
10% human serum) (sc-8002, santa cruz) or mouse
anti-human er-b (1:2 dilution with pbs in 10%
human serum) (serotec, oxford, uk) followed by
tetramethyl rhodamine iso-thiocyanate (tritc)-conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:100)
(sigma-aldrich). sections were co-incubated with
rabbit anti-human  xxxg1512xxx  (10 mg/ml in 10% human
serum) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc)
conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:100)
(sigma-aldrich). slides were mounted using fluorescent mounting media (dako).
primary breast cancer cell culture and cell line
stimulations

after ethical approval and patient consent, 24 specimens were obtained from patients undergoing surgery
(5 her2 cve, 19 her2 kve). primary breast cancer
cultures were established and validated as previously
described (fleming et al. 2004a). primary cultures and
breast cancer cell lines, endocrine-sensitive, mcf7
(atcc) and endocrine-resistant, mcf7-derived  xxxd2523xxx 
(kind gift from dr robert clarke, georgetown
university, washington dc, usa) were serum and
steroid depleted for 24 h and were then incubated in the
presence and absence of 17b-estradiol (10k8 m) or
 xxxd91xxx  (4- xxxd3285xxx ) (10k8 m) for a further
24 h and harvested. total protein was extracted using
lysis buffer (1% ipegal, 0.5%  xxxd1835xxx , 0.1%
sds and 1x pbs) with  xxxd502xxx  (5 mg/ml). cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were isolated using a ne
per extraction kit (pierce, rockford, il, usa).
western blotting

the protein samples from her2 positive and negative
breast tumours (100 mg) were electrophoresed and
transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (bio-rad, uk)
(nz3). the membrane was blocked (5% non-fat milk),
and incubated with rabbit anti- xxxg1512xxx  (2 mg/ml)
(sc-13066, santa cruz) followed by corresponding
horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody
(santa cruz) (1:7500). the membrane was developed
with intensified luminescence (pierce). western blot
www.endocrinology-journals.org

analysis of her2 positive nuclear and cytoplasmic
proteins examined in this study was carried out on
equal amounts of cellular fraction protein extracts
(100 mg/sample) isolated using the ne-per kit
(pierce). staining the membrane with ponceau s for
each experiment assessed equal protein loading. all
experiments were carried out in triplicate.
electrophoretic mobility shift assays (emsa)

emsa was performed as previously described
(fleming et al. 2004b). after ethical approval, breast
tumour specimens were obtained from patients undergoing surgery for the removal of a histologically
confirmed breast tumour. the samples were cultured
as described previously (fleming et al. 2004b)
and incubated in the presence and absence of
17b-estradiol (10 k8 m) and  xxxd91xxx 
(10k8 m) for 24 h and harvested. cell lysates were
prepared in an appropriate volume of lysis buffer with
protease inhibitors (0.5%  xxxd502xxx , roche) and
normalised for protein content. after histological
confirmation of the her2 status of the sample, 2 mg
nuclear extract was incubated in the presence of
a-[32p] dctp-labelled double-stranded oligonucleotide for oestrogen response element (ere). for
supershift experiments nuclear extracts were preincubated with antibodies against er-a, er-b and
 xxxg1512xxx . the samples were electrophoresed through a
5.5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5x
tris-borate-edta buffer. for competition studies
the reaction was performed as described with 50x
molar excess of unlabelled probe. negative controls
were nuclear extracts from the er-a- and b-negative
skbr3 breast cancer cells. in order to determine the
relative expression of proteins at the ere, emsa gels
were divided, part was exposed to x-ray film to detect
the er-ere and part was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (250 ma for 90 min) and was
subsequently immunoblotted with antibodies directed
against  xxxg1512xxx . using primary cell cultures derived
from individual her2 positive (nz3) and negative
(nz3) tumour specimens, the experiment was carried
out in triplicate.
immunoprecipitation

complex formation between the co-activator  xxxg1512xxx 
and the er isoforms, er-a and er-b was examined.
total cell lysate (100 mg) from four primary breast cell
cultures derived from her2 positive (nz3) and her2
negative (nz3) patient tumours (incubated in the
presence and absence of 17b-estradiol and
 xxxd91xxx ) were immunoprecipitated with
1137

m mc ilroy, f j fleming et al.: er– xxxg1512xxx  interactions in human breast cancer
anti- xxxg1512xxx  (2 mg) (sc-13066, santa cruz). immunoprecipitates were collected on protein a/g-agarose
(santa cruz). precipitates were immunoblotted
with either rabbit anti-human er-a (2 mg/ml) (santa
cruz) or rabbit anti-human er-b (2 mg/ml) (zymed,
ca usa).

downregulation of  xxxg1512xxx  using sirna

sirna to suppress rna expression of the  xxxg1512xxx  gene
was generated in vitro using the silencer sirna
construction kit (ambion, oxford, uk) utilising the
following oligonucleotide sequences: sirna- xxxg1512xxx 
sense: aaaagcggtcctaaggagtctcctgtctc
sirna- xxxg1512xxx  antisense: aaagactccttaggaccgttc. cells were transiently transfected using
siport amine transfection reagent (ambion). siport
amine (4 ml) and sirna- xxxg1512xxx  (2 ml) were mixed
separately with opti-minimum essential medium
(mem) (gibco-brl) to a total volume of 200 ml and
incubated at room temperature for 20 min, the mixtures
were then combined to give a final concentration of
12.5 nm and incubated at room temperature for a further
20 min. sirna- xxxg861xxx  (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase) and scrambled sirna were used as
controls. cell cultures were later stimulated 24 h posttransfection as previously described.

immunocytochemistry

ps2 protein was detected in transfected mcf7 breast
cancer cells grown on chamber slides (nunc,
rochester, ny, usa) using polyclonal goat antihuman antibody (1:50) (sc-7842, santa cruz)
followed by corresponding peroxidase conjugated
secondary antibody (1:200) (dako).

assessment of cell replication

cell replication was assessed by monitoring the
successive halving of the fluorescence of labelled
cells with every cell division. cells were treated with a
10 mm dilution of the fluorescein-based dye (cfse)
carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester (molecular probes, invitrogen, paisley, uk) and incubated
at 37 8c for 10 min. at the end of the incubation
period, cells were washed !3 with cold mem
containing 10% fetal calf serum (fcs) and then seeded
at a density of 2.5!105 cells/25 cm2. the level of
fluorescence was then analysed by flow cytometry.
cell proliferation was also monitored by cell counts
performed using trypan blue exclusion.

results
localization and expression of  xxxg1512xxx  in human
breast cancer

strong positive staining for  xxxg1512xxx  was detected in the
nuclei of breast tumour epithelial cells and to a lesser
extent within the cytoplasm, expression was absent
from surrounding normal tissue and normal reduction
mammoplasties (fig. 1a). using immunofluorescence, co-expression of  xxxg1512xxx  with the steroid
nuclear receptors er-a and er-b was observed. in
primary breast cell cultures, derived from her2
positive and her2 negative patient tumours, treatment with 4- xxxd3285xxx  induced an increase in total protein
expression of  xxxg1512xxx  only in those tumours positive
for her2. following on from this observation,  xxxg1512xxx 
was detected within the nuclear protein fraction and to
a lesser extent within the cytosol of her2 positive
tumour cells under basal conditions with an induction
observed in the nuclear fraction following treatment
with 4- xxxd3285xxx  (fig. 1c).
correlation with clinical variables

er-a and er-b were found to be expressed in 88%
and 59% of breast tumour patients respectively,
whereas  xxxg1512xxx  was detected in 53% of breast
tumours (table 1). there was a significant association observed between the expression of er-a and
 xxxg1512xxx  (pz0.0021), whereas an inverse relationship
between er-b and  xxxg1512xxx  was observed, (p!0.0001)
(table 1). no associations between the expression of
er-a was observed in relation to age, tumour size,
histological grade and axillary node status, whereas,
er-b protein was found to inversely associate with
tumour size (pz0.0064). an inverse relationship was
detected between er-b protein expression and both
her2 status and disease recurrence (pz0.0003 and
pz0.0007 respectively), conversely  xxxg1512xxx  protein
expression associated with her2 status and disease
recurrence on endocrine treatment (pz0.0058 and
pz0.0069 respectively).
recruitment of  xxxg1512xxx  to the er-a/er-b ere
complex

gel shift assays showed er-ere binding in human
primary tumour cell nuclear extracts, derived from her2
negative patients, under basal conditions and in the
presence of 17b-estradiol and 4- xxxd3285xxx . pre-incubation of
nuclear extracts with anti-er-a and anti-er-b induced a
supershift, establishing the presence of both er-a and
er-b at the protein-dna complex (fig. 2a). incubation

statistical analysis performed by chi-square test.

to determine the relative expression of  xxxg1512xxx  at the
er-ere complex, the protein-dna gels were
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. expression
of  xxxg1512xxx  was detected at the dna complex under
basal conditions and in the presence of 17b-estradiol.
however, the greatest expression of  xxxg1512xxx  was seen
with 4- xxxd3285xxx  in extracts from her2 positive patients,
indicating a greater recruitment of  xxxg1512xxx  to the
er-ere in the presence of 4- xxxd3285xxx  (fig. 2c).
the ability of the er isoforms to differentially
recruit  xxxg1512xxx  in the presence of oestrogen and
tamoxifen was examined using immunoprecipitation.
er-a interacted with  xxxg1512xxx  under control conditions
in nuclear extracts from both her2 positive and her2
negative patients. in her2 negative patients oestrogen-induced er-a– xxxg1512xxx  interactions, these
interactions were abrogated by the er modulator
4- xxxd3285xxx . however, in nuclear extracts from her2
positive patients, the greatest er-a– xxxg1512xxx  binding
was observed in the presence of 4- xxxd3285xxx  alone and in
combination with 17b-estradiol (fig. 3).
in contrast, er-b- xxxg1512xxx  interactions were seen
under basal conditions with increases in binding
observed in the presence of 17b-estradiol. 4- xxxd3285xxx 
was found to inhibit er-b- xxxg1512xxx  binding in nuclear
extracts from both her2 positive and her2 negative
breast cancer patients. furthermore, the treatment
with 4- xxxd3285xxx  abrogated the increased er-b- xxxg1512xxx 
1140

associations, which is seen in the presence of
17b-estradiol (fig. 3).
downregulation of  xxxg1512xxx  results in concomitant
loss of oestrogen target gene ps2 and restores
efficacy of tamoxifen’s anti-proliferative effect in
endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells in vitro

knockdown of  xxxg1512xxx  resulted in concomitant loss of
ps2 expression in mcf7 cells (fig. 4), in comparison a
knockdown of  xxxg861xxx  had no effect of ps2 protein
expression. in order to determine the effect of
suppressing  xxxg1512xxx  protein levels on cell replication
rates we transiently transfected her2 positive,  xxxd2523xxx 
cells with sirna- xxxg1512xxx  prior to exposure to 4- xxxd3285xxx  or
17b-estradiol (both 10k8 m). mock-transfected cells
were used as controls. in the sirna-scrambled control
transfected cells, both oestrogen and tamoxifen
enhanced cell proliferation of the endocrine-resistant
 xxxd2523xxx  cells. in contrast, it was shown that suppression of
 xxxg1512xxx  resulted in reduced 17b-estradiol and 4-ohtinduced cell proliferation in  xxxd2523xxx  cells (fig. 5a).
in carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (cfse)labelled cells it was observed that mock-transfected
cells treated with tamoxifen continued to proliferate
with almost complete abrogation of fluorescence after
72 h. in contrast, cells in which  xxxg1512xxx  had been

recent molecular and clinical studies have provided
compelling evidence of distinct roles for er-a and erb in breast tumourigenesis. despite early er-b mrna
associations with tumour grade and poor outcome
(speirs et al. 1999), we and others have described a
significant relationship between er-b protein and a
positive response to endocrine treatment (mann et al.
2001, fleming et al. 2004a, myers et al. 2004).
furthermore, we have observed an inverse association
between er-b expression and the growth factor
receptor her2 (fleming et al. 2004b). expression of
er-b as a beneficial prognostic indicator in the breast
cancer may not be a simple ligand-nuclear receptor
activated event. no difference between er-a and er-b
recruitment to the ere in primary breast tumour cells
has been observed in the presence of either 17bestradiol or tamoxifen (fleming et al. 2004b). these
findings suggest that other regulatory proteins may be
responsible for the lack of parity between the clinical
associations of each er isoform.
nuclear receptors, including er interact with
co-activator proteins to drive the transcription of target
genes.  xxxg1512xxx  has been established as an er
co-activator protein (suen et al. 1998) and has been
implicated in breast tumour progression and resistance
to endocrine therapy (osborne et al. 2003). in line with
these findings, here we describe a positive association
between  xxxg1512xxx  and recurrence with endocrine treatment. in this study we have observed co-localization of
 xxxg1512xxx  with both er-a and er-b in human breast

and er-a expression and conversely an inverse
relationship between expression of er-b and  xxxg1512xxx 
were observed. however, associations between er-a
and  xxxg1512xxx  have been previously examined, while
some studies have described a positive relationship

between er-a and  xxxg1512xxx  (iwase et al. 2003), others
have not (hudelist et al. 2003).  xxxg1512xxx  was found to
enhance oestrogen-dependent induction of  xxxg366xxx 
expression by er-a, furthermore, transcription was
completely abolished by the addition of pure or partial
anti-oestrogens (planas-silva et al. 2001).

our investigation showed recruitment of  xxxg1512xxx  to
the er-ere complex in untreated primary breast
tumour cells and following treatment with 17bestradiol. a role for her2 in er-growth factor
crosstalk has previously been proposed (johnston
et al. 2003, schiff et al. 2003), most notably, her2
has been implicated in the enhancement of  xxxg1512xxx 
co-activator activity via protein phosphorylation
(font de mora & brown 2000). recently, in
tamoxifen-resistant cell lines engineered to overexpress her2, tamoxifen-induced recruitment of
 xxxg1512xxx  to the promoter region of the er target gene
ps2 was demonstrated (shou et al. 2004). in our
study, we utilised primary breast cancer tumours
cultured ex vivo to investigate the recruitment of
 xxxg1512xxx  to the er-ere thereby enabling us to make
observations in the presence/absence of endogenous
her2 levels. we found increased levels of  xxxg1512xxx  at
the response element in her2 positive tumours, in
contrast there was no increase in recruitment
observed in her2 negative samples. moreover,
increased  xxxg1512xxx  protein expression was detected
in cells treated with tamoxifen, but not 17bestradiol, compared with control. these data further
implicate tamoxifen-induced  xxxg1512xxx -er-a-mediated

gene transcription in the presence of an active her2
map kinase pathway.
specific co-activator-nuclear receptor interactions
are thought to allow selective regulation of target genes
through distinct histone acetylation (li et al. 2003).
both er-a and er-b have a strong affinity preference
for particular co-activators, which may be mediated
through isoform specific utilization of different
lxxll motifs for their interaction with  xxxg1449xxx  proteins
(wong et al. 2001). molecular studies have shown that
 xxxg1512xxx  selectively enhances er-a and progesterone
receptor, but not er-b-dependent gene transcription
(suen et al. 1998). however, others have observed
 xxxg1512xxx  ligand-dependent interactions with both er-a
and er-b (bai & giguere 2003). in vitro studies have
demonstrated that while oestrogen enhances the
affinity of er-a and er-b for  xxxg1449xxx  co-activators,
tamoxifen and other er modulators inhibit this
interaction (wong et al. 2001). of interest however,
in transfected kidney cell lines, co-expression of the
proto-oncogene her2 has been shown to specifically
enhance er-a, but not er-b,  xxxg1512xxx  associations (bai
& giguere 2003).
in this study,  xxxg1512xxx  immunoprecipitates of her2
negative breast tumours showed oestrogen-induced
protein interactions between  xxxg1512xxx  and both er-a and
er-b, which were diminished by the er modulator
tamoxifen. however, in her2 positive breast cancer
tumours although there was oestrogen-induced protein
interactions between  xxxg1512xxx  and er-b there was no
increase in interactions with er-a. surprisingly,
increased  xxxg1512xxx -er-a interactions in the her2
positive tumours were only observed in the presence
of tamoxifen. these tamoxifen-induced associations
were er isoform specific and were not observed for
er-b. these data suggest that in breast cancer, growth
factor signalling may in part drive tamoxifen-induced
er-a– xxxg1512xxx  interactions.
we also found that knockdown of the  xxxg1512xxx 
gene at the mrna level retards cell proliferation in
her2 positive, tamoxifen resistant, breast cancer
cells in vitro. indeed,  xxxg1512xxx  appears to be so
intrinsic to cell growth that the inhibitory effect
was observed even when cells were treated with
oestrogen and tamoxifen. the fundamental influence of the co-activator on cell growth suggests
that its role is not simply mediated through nuclear
receptors but may be channelled through various
transactivators. however, the magnitude of
increased recruitment of  xxxg1512xxx  to er-a, in
her2 positive tumour cells when treated with
tamoxifen provides evidence of one mechanism at
play in endocrine therapy resistance.

m mc ilroy, f j fleming et al.: er– xxxg1512xxx  interactions in human breast cancer
the significance of er-a– xxxg1512xxx  interactions in
breast cell cultures derived from her2 positive patient
tumours, in relation to endocrine resistance is
supported by the strong association detected between
the expression of er-a and  xxxg1512xxx  in our cohort of
breast tumour patients. taken together, these data
provide evidence of a tamoxifen-induced selective
interaction between er-a and  xxxg1512xxx , which may in
part explain differential associations between
expression of er isoforms and resistance to endocrine
treatment in breast cancer.
