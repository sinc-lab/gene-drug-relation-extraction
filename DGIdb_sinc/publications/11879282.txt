monoclonal antibody
therapy
for lymphoma
an update

the purpose of this article is to review the historical
development and recent advances in the application of monoclonal
antibodies for the treatment of lymphoma.
purpose:

the history of clinical applications of monoclonal antibodies has been intertwined with that of lymphomas. the first
report of a complete remission in 1981 described a patient
with follicular lymphoma who was treated with a murine antiidiotype antibody. later that decade there appeared additional
encouraging reports of radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, immunotoxins, and other antibodies with antitumor effects against lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. monoclonal antibodies
as a treatment of malignancy became reality in late 1997 when the
us food and drug administration approved the anti-cd20 chimeric monoclonal antibody rituximab for the treatment of b-cell
lymphoma. since that time an anti-cd25 monoclonal antibody
( xxxd1798xxx ) and an anti-cd25 immunotoxin fusion product ( xxxd1832xxx ) have become clinically available. several radiolabeled antibodies, including the murine anti-cd20 products
131
i- xxxd3405xxx  and 90y- xxxd2312xxx , are in advanced
stages of clinical testing as are other unlabeled monoclonal antibodies with antilymphoma activity. other antilymphoma immunotoxins that react with cd25,  xxxg375xxx , and  xxxg378xxx  also have shown
promise.
overview:

the therapeutic arsenal against lymphoma
has been significantly changed by the addition of these antibody
products that are active as single agents, and are synergistic, additive, or both with other antilymphoma treatments.

clinical implications:

ver since the german nobel prize-winning immunologist paul ehrlich espoused the concept of “magic bullets” for the treatment of infectious diseases and cancer,
antibodies have been considered to have great potential as
anticancer agents because of their specificity for cellmembrane antigens.1 the 1986 nobel prize winners hans
kohler and caesar milstein published the hybridoma methodology for monoclonal antibody production that made
large-scale clinical testing of antibodies possible for the first
time.2 the application of recombinant dna technology permitted the production of unlimited quantities of clinical
grade chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies for
clinical use and also made feasible the production of genetically engineered fusion products.3,4 the rationales for various approaches to monoclonal antibody-mediated therapy
are summarized in table 1 and are described in more detail
in other publications.5–14 whole antibodies may produce
anticancer effects in conjunction with the immune system
by interaction with complement proteins (complementmedicated cytotoxicity), effector cells (antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity), or both via the fc portion of the antibody molecule. antibodies also may neutralize circulating ligands or block cell membrane receptors
and, thus, interrupt ligand-receptor interactions and signal
transductions that are associated with cell proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, or both, or that interfere with the
microenvironment, such as altering angiogenesis. the antiidiotype network cascade provides a rationale for antibodies as “feedback inhibition” or vaccine therapy. antibodies
also may serve as carriers to target other cytotoxic agents
such as the following: 1) radioisotopes for radioimmunodetection and radioimmunotherapy; 2) natural and synthetic
toxins; 3) chemotherapy drugs; 4) various cytokines; and 5)
effector cells such as cytotoxic lymphocytes.

the clinical development of monoclonal antibodies has
been closely tied to the treatment of b-cell and t-cell malignancies, especially lymphomas (table 2). the first report
of an effort to treat a patient with a monoclonal antibody was published in 1980.15 within a year of this report,
other investigators reported antitumor effects and infusion reactions in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) and t-cell lymphoma that were subsequently
confirmed in larger trials.5,6 these early reports defined
certain side effects and toxicities that predictably occurred
when antibodies removed circulating antigen-positive cells
from the circulation.5,6,16 in 1982, there appeared the first
report of a complete remission obtained with monoclonal antibody treatment in a patient with follicular lymphoma who was treated with repeated doses of a custom-tailored, patient-specific anti-idiotype antibody.17 a
major limitation of these early monoclonal antibodies was
the mouse protein used, which often induced human
antimouse antibodies and thus limited the ability to treat
patients repetitively over time. this limitation was not
the result of toxicity but, rather, of the neutralizing
antibodies.18–20
meanwhile, other investigators were exploring various
types of immunoconjugates, hoping to use the monoclonal

cytotoxic agents such as ricin or its active ricin  xxxg220xxx .
these approaches also produced some encouraging results
as well as predictable toxicities. because of the known radiosensitivity of lymphomas to radiation therapy, there was
great interest in pursuing antibody radiopharmaceuticals
for the treatment of those hematologic diseases. despite
these efforts, the medical community in general was disappointed that, 15 years after clinical testing had begun, there
were no therapeutic products approved for the treatment
of a malignant disease.21
the pessimism surrounding antibody-mediated therapy
finally lifted in november 1997 when the anti-cd20
monoclonal antibody rituximab (rituxan, idec pharmaceuticals, san diego, ca) became the first monoclonal antibody product approved by the us food and drug
administration (fda) for the treatment of a malignant disease, namely, b-cell lymphoma.22 interestingly,
idec pharmaceuticals was originally founded to develop
the anti-idiotype antibody technology, but instead it
gained success on the basis of a highly effective antibody
that reacts with most normal and malignant b lymphocytes! with this milestone, monoclonal antibodies
joined  xxxg1137xxx , interleukin (il)-2, and various hematopoietic growth factors as well-established components of biologic therapy, the fourth modality of cancer
treatment.23
this seemingly opened the floodgates to a rush of
other antibodies that have exhibited efficacy for the treatment of lymphoma. it also resulted in a new nomenclature for monoclonal antibody products. one can determine the nature of a monoclonal antibody product by
the suffix in its generic name. thus, momab refers to a mouse
antibody, uximab to a chimeric antibody, and uzumab to a
humanized antibody. for a list of issues related to the clinical
application of monoclonal antibodies, see table 3.
the remainder of this article focuses on several of these
products that are already in standard use, are being extensively tested in the clinic, or both.

unconjugated antibodies
rituximab
this agent was approved by the fda in 1997 with a
marketing indication for b-cell lymphoma. it is a mouse/
human chimeric antibody that was produced using recombinant dna technology to combine murine-variable regions
with human igg1-constant regions. the genetically engineered monoclonal antibody was then “manufactured” in
chinese hamster ovary cells. rituximab reacts with the
cd20 molecule that is expressed on normal and malignant
b lymphocytes but not on nonhematopoietic tissue, b-cell
progenitors, plasma cells, t lymphocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, or stem cells. the mouse/human chimeric antibody is cytolytic against cd20-positive cells in the presence
of human complement and human effector cells. the binding of rituximab to cd20 may promote apoptosis, which
perhaps is related to cd20 acting as a calcium channel
receptor that is important in preventing apoptosis. there
is reason to believe that the regulatory effects related to
rituximab binding to cd20 are more important than the
immunologic mechanisms of antitumor effect that have
been observed.
clinical testing of rituximab was initiated in 1993.
phase i single-dose escalation trials were associated with
sustained clinical activity and minimal toxicity.24 trials using a weekly-times-four schedule yielded a response rate of
47% in patients with indolent lymphomas (defined as working group formulation a-d).25 a pivotal trial of 166 patients
with indolent lymphomas that had progressed after prior
chemotherapy confirmed a response rate of about 60% in
follicular lymphomas and 10% to 15% in working group
formulation a lymphomas (ie, small lymphocytic, cll-like,
and waldenstrom-like lymphomas).26 the median duration
of response was 13.2 months, and 87% of patients had at
least some regression of measurable lymphoma. although
the complete response rate in this trial was initially reported as only 6%, the use of consensus criteria for response in lymphoma would increase the complete response rate to more than 40%! 27,28 serum levels of
rituximab usually were elevated for 3 to 6 months after
treatment, although some patients exhibited much more
rapid pharmacokinetics. in some patients, the resolution of
tumors was gradual, such that a tumor response could not
be declared until several months after the discontinuation
of treatment. there was a correlation between how long
rituximab could be measured in the serum and the likelihood of tumor response,29 which has raised the question of
whether some patients respond better to higher doses or
more prolonged therapy. the probability of tumor response
was unrelated to age, lactate dehydrogenase level, ␤2microglobulin level, or prior anthracycline therapy. patients
with lower tumor burdens were more likely to respond
based on bone marrow involvement, extranodal involvement, and size of the largest lesion. however, response
rates did not vary significantly among groups of patients
whose largest lesions were <5 cm, 5 to 7 cm, 7 to 10 cm,26
or >10 cm.30 the subgroup with the highest response rate
consisted of patients who had relapsed after a previous
stem-cell transplant. there was a 73% response rate in this

73

group (18 of 23 patients). this high response rate is probably explained by these patients having follicular lymphomas, low tumor burdens at the time of treatment because of
the close observation of post-transplant patients, and their
motivation to be treated aggressively. the difference in response between follicular and nonfollicular low-grade lymphomas correlated with the degree of antigen expression,
which is much greater in follicular lymphomas.31
a number of other trials involving rituximab have been
conducted, and innumerable others are in progress. the
issue of safety and efficacy of retreatment was addressed in
a trial of 60 patients who had initially achieved an objective
complete or partial response in a rituximab trial. retreatment was associated with a response rate of 41% and a
median duration of response of 10 months.32 the responses
were sometimes greater and more durable than the initial
response, perhaps because patients had lower tumor burdens at the time of retreatment, and there was no difference
in toxicity compared with the first treatment course of
rituximab. interestingly, the lack of response again rarely
related to a loss of expression of cd20 by a treatment selection process and was not related to the production of a
host immune response against the antibody.
another trial addressed the toxicity and efficacy of 8
weeks instead of 4 weeks of treatment in 37 patients with
indolent lymphoma that had progressed after chemotherapy.33 the response rate was about 60% with a median
time to progression of greater than 19 months in the responders. these results were not  xxxd102xxx  than those
seen with 4 weeks of treatment, although there is still some
suggestion that patients with working group formulation a
disease have better responses to this longer and higher cumulative dose of treatment. in this trial, the final report
described a response rate of 69% for the 30 patients with
follicular lymphoma, but only 1 of 7 patients with small cell
lymphoma had a durable objective remission.
several european trials have addressed the activity of
rituximab in various types of lymphoma. a french trial of
54 patients included 12 patients with mantle cell lymphoma
and 30 patients with large cell lymphoma.34 this was designed as a randomized phase ii trial in which both groups
received 8 weeks of therapy instead of 4, and one group
received 375 mg/m2 weekly for 8 weeks, and the other
group received 500 mg/m2 on weeks 2 to 8 after an initial
standard dose. there was no difference in response rate
between the two groups, so the response data were
grouped together. the overall response rate was 31%, with
a median response duration of greater than 8 months. the
response rates were 30% in patients with mantle cell lymphoma and 37% in those with large cell lymphoma. another
european trial used the standard 4-week course of treatment at a dose of 375 mg/m2.35 these researchers reported
a 29% response rate in 34 patients with newly diagnosed
mantle cell lymphoma, a 33% response rate in 40 patients
with mantle cell lymphoma that was either refractory to or
had progressed after chemotherapy, 25% in 28 patients
with intermediate lymphomas, and 14% in 29 patients with
small cell lymphoma. most responses were evident within 1
month after the completion of therapy. the median duration of response was 1.2 years for the patients with mantle
cell lymphoma who had objective responses to treatment.

74

in vitro tests suggested that the presence of rituximab
enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapy, thus creating a rationale for combined-modality treatment. in a trial of 38
patients with indolent lymphomas, 80% of whom had not
been treated previously, a combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (chop)
chemotherapy plus rituximab was associated with a response rate of 100%, and a median progression-free survival
of greater than 3.3 years.36 two doses of antibody were
given before the first dose of chop, then additional doses
were given after the second and fourth doses of chop,
then two more doses of rituximab were given after the
sixth dose of chop. similar encouraging results were noted
when chop and rituximab were combined in a trial involving 31 patients with intermediate lymphoma.37 these patients had received no prior treatment for lymphoma, and
19% had large cell follicular lymphoma (working group formulation d) and 68% had large cell diffuse lymphoma
(working group formulation g). the objective response
rate was 96%, including 63% complete responses and 33%
partial responses. in this trial, rituximab was given 48 hours
before each dose of chop using a 3-week treatment cycle.
there was no increase in toxicity over what one would
have expected from either chop or rituximab alone in
either of these trials.
rituximab also has been explored in waldenstrom-like
lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma, which previously involved a small subset of patients with working group formulation a disease. unlike the cells in patients with cll and
small b-cell lymphoma, the b lymphocytes associated with
this disease group have a high-expression of cd20. furthermore, although this entity usually does have increased numbers of circulating b lymphocytes of the malignant clone,
lymphocyte numbers typically are not as great as those seen
in patients with cll. an initial report of seven patients
included objective regressions in four without excessive
toxicity.38
numerous additional trials are in progress integrating
rituximab with chemotherapy. randomized trials are being
conducted to compare chop to chop plus rituximab, either in combination or as consolidation therapy. in the setting of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell
rescue, trials are in progress to determine the value of in
vivo purging of cd20 cells before stem cell harvesting and
the use of consolidation treatment with rituximab after marrow recovery. because of its efficacy in patients who suffer
relapse, rituximab is being widely used as initial therapy for
indolent lymphoma. as expected, preliminary reports show
that the agent appears to be quite active in that setting. in
one study, 39 of 41 patients completed the initial 4-week
treatment course, and 21 (51%) of 41 had exhibited a response by 2 weeks after the completion of treatment. four
additional patients subsequently were declared to be responders for an objective response rate of 61%, and disease
progression occurred in only 10%.39 this study suggested a
similar response rate in small cell and follicular lymphomas,
but the definitions of response were such that the durability
of the response is unclear. the antibody also is being tested
in patients with aids-related lymphomas or central nervous
system lymphomas, two groups that were excluded in the
pivotal trial.

 xxxd1798xxx 
 xxxd1798xxx  (zenapax, hoffmann-laroche, nutley, nj)
was approved by the fda in 1998, with a marketing indication for kidney transplant rejection. it is a humanized
monoclonal antibody directed against cd25, the receptor
for il-2, which generally is not expressed on resting lymphocytes but is often overexpressed in activated and malignant lymphocytes, especially t lymphocytes. although this
monoclonal antibody was approved based on data submitted for the prevention of renal allograft rejection, it also has
activity in the treatment of t-cell malignancy. the unmodified murine anti-tac (55-kd subunit of the  xxxg1175xxx )
monoclonal antibody produced objective remissions in 7 of
19 patients with adult t-cell leukemia.40,41 formal studies of
 xxxd1798xxx  in lymphoma have not yet been published.

alemtuzumab
alemtuzumab (campath, ilex oncology, san antonio,
tx) has not yet been formally approved by the fda, but it
is in expanded access trials for patients with cll. it is a
humanized monoclonal antibody that reacts with the  xxxg393xxx 
molecule that is found on both normal and malignant b and
t lymphocytes and, therefore, is present on most lymphomas.42 the rat versions of this antibody showed limited
clinical activity, but in vitro cytotoxicity in the presence of
human complement cells, effector cells, or both was greatly
enhanced with the human igg1 construct. this product has
shown significant durable effects in the treatment of patients with recurrent cll where a dose of 30 mg three
times per week for up to 12 weeks was associated with a
42% response rate in 29 patients.43 trials in patients with
cll refractory to  xxxd2120xxx  also have yielded encouraging
results.44 a response rate of 73% was observed among 15
patients with prolymphocytic leukemia.45 alemtuzumab
also was evaluated in 50 patients with previously treated
indolent lymphoma, 25 who had relapsed after an initial
response and 25 who were refractory to initial chemotherapy.46 there was a 20% response rate, including complete regression of skin lesions in three of eight patients
with mycosis fungoides. however, the response rate was
only 14% among patients with b-cell lymphomas. although
alemtuzumab has been associated with significant immunosuppression and opportunistic infections, it appears that
this risk can be reduced by therapy with prophylactic antimicrobial agents.

 xxxd2015xxx 
 xxxd2015xxx  ( xxxd2015xxx , immunomedics, morris
plains, nj) has not yet been formally approved by the fda, but
is now in multicenter phase iii trials. it is a humanized igg1
antibody that targets the  xxxg378xxx . phase 1 dose escalation trials of doses of 120 mg/m2 to 1000 mg/m2 weekly for 4
weeks have been reported in abstract form.47 in these studies,
which have involved more than 40 patients, several objective
clinical responses, including complete remissions, have been
observed in patients with relapsed lymphoma who received
doses of at least 360 mg/m2. this includes a complete re-

sponse that has persisted for more than a year in a patient with
lymphoma who had been refractory to rituximab. treatment
with this agent has been well tolerated, with no surprising
toxicities described.

anti-idiotype antibodies
these are custom-tailored antibodies directed against
the idiotopes of the specific paraprotein of a malignant
b-cell clone. because they are patient specific, there is no
standard product that has been submitted for fda approval.
the idiotype of such malignant clones is perhaps the best
example of a tumor-specific antigen. the first complete
remission of a patient with lymphoma who was treated
with monoclonal antibodies occurred after administration
of anti-idiotype antibodies.17 that complete remission in a
patient in whom the disease had progressed after prior
treatment with chemotherapy and interferon-␣ persisted
for more than 7 years. subsequent publications have reported a cumulative 66% response rate among 45 patients
with indolent lymphoma who received anti-idiotype antibodies alone or received single-agent  xxxd1665xxx , interferon-␣, or il-2.48 the major problem with this approach is
the expense and time required in developing patientspecific products. while there is some evidence of crossexpression of certain idiotypes that might allow treatment
of multiple patients with combinations of anti-idiotype antibodies,49,50 this approach was abandoned by idec pharmaceutical in favor of developing the anti-cd20 antibody
that became rituximab.22 while there has continued to be a
research interest in this approach, it seems unlikely that the
approach will attract commercial interest because of the
cost of developing individualized patient treatment products and the efficacy of various antigen-specific products
that fit more readily into the classic drug development paradigm. for a select list of conjugated antibodies, see table 4.

radiolabeled antibodies
the clinical application of radiolabeled antibodies is
not as straightforward as that of unconjugated antibodies.
most approaches involve a preinjection (typically 1 week
before) of an unconjugated antibody to clear circulating
antigen-bearing cells so that the bulk of radiolabeled material is not bound in the circulation and is taken to the lung,

spleen, and liver. in the product development phase of
clinical testing, tracer doses of radiolabeled antibodies have
been used to make estimates of dosimetry and, in some
cases, to exclude patients with unfavorable biodistribution
of the product. the use of radioisotopes necessitates the
oversight of experts in nuclear medicine, isotopic radiation
oncology, radiation physicists, and radiation safety officers.
in some cases, some degree of patient isolation is needed
for varying periods of time because of radiation safety issues. nevertheless, the lymphomas are known to be radiosensitive tumors, and encouraging results have been
achieved with radiolabeled antibodies for more than a decade in this disease. because radiation effects may occur
over several millimeters in the case of ␤-emitting isotopes,
there is the potential to kill antigen-negative cells or cells
that express the target antigen at low levels. however, the
effects of total body irradiation from circulating radiolabeled antibodies, and the effects on the bone marrow because of binding to lymphocytes in that location, have made
bone marrow suppression a dose-limiting toxicity for this
approach. such products have a theoretical advantage in
that not every tumor cell needs to express large quantities
of cd20 because the ␤-rays penetrate a few millimeters. on
the other hand, such products that target cells in the bone
marrow are associated with at least transient pancytopenia
and, theoretically, may be associated with a risk of myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia.
131

i  xxxd3405xxx 

131

i  xxxd3405xxx  (bexxar, coulter, palo alto, ca) is
not yet fda approved but is in expanded-access clinical
trials for patients with indolent or transformed b-cell lymphoma. it is a murine anti-cd20 antibody with the radioisotope 131i attached. 131i emits both ␥ and ␤ radiation.
patients who undergo treatment with such a radiopharmaceutical must take oral iodine to block thyroid uptake of 131i
that is released from the radiolabeled product. the murine
monoclonal antibody has been retained because it results in
faster clearance of the unbound radiolabeled antibody from
the circulation. for treatment purposes, a small quantity of
the radiolabeled antibody is administered in combination
with a much larger dose of unlabeled  xxxd3405xxx . this
approach has produced response rates from 40% to 95%
in patients with a variety of histologies and prior therapies.51–55 the delivery of 25 to 85 cgy of whole-body radiation with 34 to 161 mci of 131i was associated with a 79%
response rate in 45 patients with indolent or transformed
b-cell lymphoma who had experienced disease progression
after prior chemotherapy. the median duration of response
was 11.7 months, and the median survival of all patients
treated was 4.2 years. the best results were seen at doses of
65 to 75 cgy. human antimouse antibodies were detected
in only 12% of patients.
there was a recent report of 76 patients with advanced
stage follicular lymphoma who had not had prior exposure to chemotherapy who were treated with 131i- xxxd3405xxx .56 the treatment of these patients consisted of a
clearing dose of 450 mg of unlabeled  xxxd3405xxx  and
a dosimetric dose of 35 mg of  xxxd3405xxx  containing 5

76

mci of 131i, followed 1 to 2 weeks later by infusion of
an individualized dose containing 75 mci for radioimmunotherapy. this resulted in a response rate of 97% and
complete responses in 63% of patients. the 3-year progression-free survival rate among these patients is projected
to be 68% after a median follow-up time of 16.2 months.
interestingly, 65% of these patients developed human
antimouse antibodies, which has been an uncommon event
in patients with lymphoma who had previously received
chemotherapy.
other investigators have explored potentially myeloablative doses of 10 to 30 gy 131i anti-cd20 monoclonal
antibodies, using autologous stem cell rescue.57 this approach requires a careful assessment of dosimetry with a
lower imaging dose of only 5 to 10 mci to be sure of adequate uptake by the tumor and lack of too much uptake in
other critical organs. using this approach, only 23 of 43
patients with recurrent lymphoma were able to be treated
on the basis of a favorable biodistribution of antibody, with
administration of autologous stem cells 12 to 18 days later.
of the 21 patients who received the planned therapeutic
doses, 2 died of sepsis, but of the remaining 19 patients 84%
had a complete response and only 1 patient did not achieve
an objective response. more recent reports have described
29 treated patients who, at a median follow-up time of 3.5
years, had a progression-free survival rate of 42% and an
overall survival rate of 68%. the progression-free survival
rate at 6 years was estimated to be 51% in the patients with
low-grade lymphomas and 20% in those with intermediategrade lymphomas. this agent is currently being used in
expanded-access trials, and there is good reason to believe
that the agent will receive regulatory approval in the near
future.

90

y  xxxd2312xxx  (zevalin, idec, san diego,
ca) is not yet fda approved but is in expanded-access
clinical trials for patients with indolent or transformed bcell lymphoma. it is a murine anti-cd20 monoclonal antibody with the ␤-emitter 90y conjugated to it by a linker. the
murine form was retained, rather than simply radiolabelling
rituximab, to achieve faster clearance from the circulation.
for treatment purposes, a small quantity of the radiolabeled
antibody is administered in combination with a much larger
dose of rituximab. this approach has produced response
rates similar to those seen with 131i-tositutomab. initial trials
were associated with an objective response rate of 82% in

patients with low-grade lymphoma and 67% in those with
intermediate-grade lymphoma.58,59 a recent report described a comparison of rituximab to 90y -ibritumomab
tituxetan in 90 patients with follicular lymphoma in whom
the disease had progressed after previous chemotherapy.60
patients in the radiotherapy arm received 250 mg/m2 of
rituximab to clear circulating b lymphocytes, along with a
tracer dose of 5 mci of 111-indium-labeled anti-cd20 as an
imaging agent and for dosimetry. one week later, patients
received another 250 mg/m2 of rituximab along with
enough 90y  xxxd2312xxx  to deliver 0.4 mci/kg.
patients in the rituximab-alone arm received the standard
dose of 375 mg/m2 intravenously weekly for 4 weeks. the
objective response rate for rituximab alone was 44%, which
is similar to the response rate observed in the pivotal study
of the agent.26 the objective response rate for the patients
who received rituximab plus radioimmunotherapy was
80%, which was statistically better (p < .001). recent reports suggest that the dosimetric dose is no longer being
used in ongoing trials.61 this agent is currently being used
in expanded-access trials, and there is good reason to believe that the agent will receive regulatory approval in the
near future.

131

i-lym-1 (oncolym, schering ag) has been used for
many years in clinical trials but does not have the approval
of the fda at this time. it is a murine monoclonal antibody
that reacts with the class ii human leukocyte antigen (hladr) complex. trials of unlabeled lym-1 were not associated
with clinical benefits,62 but trials of radioimmunotherapy
have produced responses in patients with cll and b-cell
lymphoma. phase ii trials involving 88 patients were associated with an objective response rate of 56% and a complete response rate of 37%, including a 41% response rate in
patients with intermediate- and high-grade b-cell lymphoma.63,64 an ongoing trial is exploring the administration
of two doses of 60 mci/m2 given 6 weeks apart in patients
with intermediate- and high-grade b-cell lymphoma. a
preparation of 67-cu-lym-1 produced tumor responses in 7
of 12 patients with progressing lymphoma. for a select list

tion for cutaneous t-cell lymphoma, but it is potentially
therapeutic for any malignancy that expresses the  xxxg1175xxx . it is actually not an antibody product but, rather, is
a recombinant dna product that results from the fusion
of genes for il-2 and the a chain of diphtheria toxin, such
that it binds to and is internalized by the  xxxg1175xxx 
cd25. thus, it is an immunotoxin that uses the il-2 ligand,
rather than an antibody that reacts with cd25. the schedule of dab389il-2 was 9 to 18 µg/kg/d for 5 days every 3
weeks.65–67 there was a 30% response rate among 72 patients, but there was also a 69% frequency of hypersensitivity reactions, and 48% of patients had edema because of the
immunogenicity of the ricin a-chain moiety.

lmb-2
lmb-2 is an antibody immunotoxin that is investigational. it is a single-chain antibody fv fragment anti-tac
(cd25) fused to a truncated pseudomonas exotoxin. in a
dose escalation trial, 35 patients with various t-cell malignancies, hodgkin’s disease, and hairy cell leukemia were
treated, with seven patients achieving a partial response.68

anti-b4-blocked ricin
anti-b4-blocked ricin has been tested extensively in
clinical trials but has not been approved by the fda for a
standard indication. it is a construct consisting of a mouse
anti- xxxg375xxx  monoclonal antibody conjugated to ricin with
the nonspecific galactose binding site blocked. any cell
binding should then be via the  xxxg375xxx , which internalizes
after an antibody binds to it. theoretically, an intact ricin
reagent might be more effective than a-chain preparations.
phase i and ii trials with this reagent were associated with
some tumor regressions but also with significant side effects, including hepatic dysfunction and capillary-leak
problems.69–71 repeated treatment was complicated by
the development of human antimouse antibodies and human antiricin antibodies. in a large randomized trial, lymphoma patients who had undergone high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue were randomized
to receive adjunctive anti-b4-blocked ricin or placebo.72
there was no significant difference in outcomes, and this
product apparently is no longer being considered for clinical development.

77

deglycosylated ricin a
chain immunotoxins
these are also investigational antibody immunotoxins.
they consist of various antibodies conjugated to the a-chain
moiety of the natural toxin ricin, which is derived from the
castor bean. the a chain, which inhibits protein synthesis
at the level of the 60s ribosome, is deglycosylated to decrease nonspecific uptake in the liver. unlike cd20, the
target antigens for these immunotoxins act as internalizing
receptors, which are critical to the cleavage of the active
deglycosylated rich a chain (dga) in the cytosol for its biologic activity. a predictable toxicity associated with ricin
and its a chain is some degree of capillary-leak syndrome,
often the dose-limiting toxicity for such preparations.73
hd37-dga. hd37-dga is a dga conjugated to a
monoclonal antibody directed against the  xxxg378xxx . in
a phase i trial of intermittent bolus schedule, objective tumor responses were noted in 6 (25%) of 24 patients.74 in a
phase i trial with a continuous infusion schedule, objective
responses were reported for 4 (22%) of 18 patients.75
rfb4-dga. this agent is a dga conjugated to a monoclonal antibody directed against the  xxxg375xxx . in phase
i trials rfb4-dga produced objective responses in 2 of 23
patients treated by a bolus schedule and in 1 of 9 evaluable
patients receiving a continuous infusion.76 in a phase i trial
of continuous infusion delivery of both rfb4-dga and
hd37-dga immunotoxins (combotox), only 2 (9%) of 22
patients had an objective response, but there was unexpected significant toxicity in this trial.77 for a select list of
immunotoxins, see table 6.

side effects and toxicity
a common toxicity seen with virtually all monoclonal
antibody products that react with an antigen that is expressed on circulating target cells, is a symptom complex
that includes, fever, chills or rigors, skin rash, nausea, throat
tightness, dyspnea, headache, and hypotension. this syndrome and its association with monoclonal antibodies used
in hematologic malignancies was well described during the
era of murine monoclonal antibodies and can be life threatening in debilitated patients, when the agent is rapidly infused in the setting of large numbers of high-antigenexpressing circulating cells, or both.5,6,16 the mechanism
for this reaction appears to relate to removal of opsonized
target cells in the reticuloendothelial system, followed by

the release of immunoactive cytokines such as il-2 and  xxxg2296xxx .78 if the circulating target cells have a
high proliferative index, then there also is a potential for a
true tumor-lysis syndrome.79 with slower rates of infusion,
these symptoms were usually only mild to moderate in severity and are most significant during the first of any series
of infusions. thus, unless a patient has already been depleted of circulating target cells before treatment with a
monoclonal antibody, one can anticipate having varying
degrees of these reactions. it is important to understand
that this is a result of the specific antibody-antigen binding
to circulating cells and is not an inherent problem with all
antibodies. some mouse antibodies against solid tumors
that do not cross-react with circulating cells have been
given rapidly in gram quantities without any toxicity whatsoever. on the other hand, rapid infusion of a high dose
of an antibody that reacts with circulating cells can lead
to severe reactions, including severe hypoxemia, severe hypotension, and death. patients with significant comorbid
medical conditions, such as renal failure, cirrhosis, and
poor performance status, may be especially vulnerable
to life-threatening complications in association with such
reactions.

clinical implications
before 1997, chemotherapy was the major systemic
treatment for the treatment of lymphoma. unfortunately,
retrospective analyses showed that over the previous several decades there had been no improvement in survival
rates for persons with indolent lymphomas80 and that no
combinations of chemotherapy were superior to the chop
regimen for the treatment of intermediate lymphomas.81
during the past decade, the introduction of the purine analogs, including  xxxd2120xxx  (fludara, berlex laboratories,
richmond, ca),  xxxd2879xxx  ( xxxd2879xxx , supergen, san
ramon, ca) and 2- xxxd1712xxx  (cladribine,  xxxd1712xxx , ortho biotech, raritan, nj),82–84 and the agent mitoxantrone ( xxxd2657xxx , immunex, seattle, wa),85 have
improved and expanded our therapeutic armamentarium
for both b-cell and t-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.
high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue
can be curative salvage therapy for some patients with lymphoma.86,87 despite these advances in chemotherapy,
monoclonal antibodies are having a tremendous impact on
the treatment of lymphoma. rituximab already has become
an agent of choice in the treatment of b-cell malignancy
and, from a sales standpoint, is the most successful anticancer agent ever launched, having surpassed the first-year
sales of the previous record holder paclitaxel (taxol, bristol-myers squibb, princeton, nj). antibody-based therapies
have been embraced by patients and physicians because of
their different mechanisms of action and markedly reduced
toxicity as compared with classical chemotherapy agents.
the therapeutic arsenal against lymphoma has been significantly changed by the addition of these products that are
active as single agents and are synergistic, additive, or both
with other antilymphoma treatments. numerous other antibody reagents are likely to receive fda approval in the

near future. during the next decade there will be a great
need for clinical trials to establish the relative efficacy of
various combinations and sequences of antibody products
and chemotherapy as well as to determine the long-term
effects of the various treatment strategies.
