abstract: triazolobenzodiazepines are in clinical use as
hypnotics and anxiolytics. we analyzed in vivo receptor
binding and brain concentrations of alprazolam, triazolam,
and  xxxd2036xxx . drug concentrations measured in the cerebral cortex i h after administration were directly proportional to dose for all three compounds. in vivo receptor
binding, as defined by the specific uptake of [3h]ro151788, decreased with increasing doses of  xxxd2036xxx  and
triazolam, a finding indicating dose-related increases in receptor occupancy due to these compounds, triazolam was
substantially more potent, with an icso value of 16 ng/g,
compared with 1 17 ng/g for  xxxd2036xxx . at higher doses of
alprazolam (>0.2 mg/kg), receptor binding by [3h]ro151788 likewise decreased with increasing dose of the former
drug. however, at lower doses of alprazolam (0.02-0.05
mg/kg), which resulted in cortex concentrations of 2-7
ng/g, receptor binding was increased above control values
in cortex, hypothalamus, and hippocampus but not in several other brain regions. binding returned to control values
at doses of 50.01 mg/kg. similar results were obtained in

time course studies. at 8 and 10 h after a dose of 1 mg/kg
i.p., corresponding to cortex concentrations of 2.7-7 ng/g,
receptor binding was increased compared with controls.
similarly, at i , 2, and 3 h after a single dose of 0.05 mg/kg,
corresponding to cortex concentrations of 3.7-5.8 ng/g, receptor binding was also increased. the apparent affinity of
benzodiazepine receptors for clonazepam in mice receiving
alprazolam (0.05 mg/kg) was unchanged from that in untreated control mice, an observation suggesting that low
doses of alprazolam increased receptor number. the brain
concentration vs. receptor occupancy relationships for triazolam and  xxxd2036xxx  resemble those for other benzodiazepines, but alprazolam appears to be anomalous in that low
brain concentrations increase benzodiazepine receptor
number. key words: triazolobenzodiazepine-receptor

triazolobenzodiazepinesare in widespread clinical
use. triazolam and  xxxd2036xxx  are generally used as
hypnotics, whereas alprazolam is primarily used as an
anxiolytic (pakes et al., 1981; fawcett and kravitz,
1982; greenblatt et al., 1983a; dawson et al., 1984).
there is clinical evidence that alprazolam has additional efficacy in depression and in panic disorders
(ciraulo et al., 1986). all three drugs bind to central
benzodiazepine receptors in vitro, and this binding
presumably mediates their anxiolytic and hypnotic
effects (haefely et al., 1985). the mechanism of possible antidepressant or antipanic effects of alprazolam
is uncertain, although some evidence implicates

adrenergic receptors (sethy and hodges, 1982; eriksson et al., 1986). prior studies of in vitro receptor
binding with triazolam and alprazolam reported that
alprazolam had binding characteristics similar to
those of other benzodiazepines (kochman and
hirsch, 1982; sethy and hams, 1982a; sethy et al.,
1983), but triazolam had somewhat different properties with regard to the potentiation of binding by yaminobutyric acid (gaba) at 0°c and to altered ic5,,
at 37°c (braestrup and nielsen, 1981; clow et al.,
1985). such in vitro analyses are limited by effects of
tissue preparation, gaba concentrations, and temperature and buffer conditions (doble, 1983; miller

several groups have used an
in vivo method for assessing benzodiazepine receptor
binding that avoids some of t h e limitations of t h e i n
vitro studies (goeders and kuhar, 1985; miller et al.,
1987b). w e used this technique to reexamine receptor binding characteristics of t h e triazolobenzodiazepines alprazolam, triazolam, and  xxxd2036xxx .
materials and methods
materials
male cd- 1 mice, 6-8 weeks of age, were obtained from
charles river laboratories (wellesley, ma, u.s.a.),
housed under a 12-h lightldark cycle, and fed laboratory
chow and water ad libitum. alprazolam, clonazepam,  xxxd2036xxx , triazolam, the internal standard u-32485, and
rol5-1788 were kindly provided by their respective manufacturers. [3h]ro15-1788 (specific activity = 8 1 ci/mmol)
and protosol were obtained from new england nuclear
(boston, ma, u.s.a.). scintillation fluid (hp) was obtained
from beckman (fullerton, ca, u.s.a.). all other reagents
were obtained from standard commercial sources.

in some experiments approximately one-half of each cortex
was reserved for analysis of drug concentrations. brain tissue was then placed in scintillation vials, and 2 ml of protosol was added. vials were incubated at 40°c for 24 h.
scintillation fluid (10 ml) was subsequently added to each
vial, and vials were allowed to sit at room temperature for
24 h. samples were then counted for radioactivity by conventional scintillation spectrometry. for determining nonspecific binding, animals were treated with a saturating
dose of clonazepam ( 5 mg/kg 1.p.). after 30 min, [3h]rol5-1788 was injected, and tissue was processed as above.
specific binding was defined as total binding minus nonspecific binding as measured at the time of killing. in some
experiments, receptor occupancy was calculated as follows:
percentage occupancy = ( i - {[(sample cpm/sample
weight) - (nonspecific cpm/nonspecific weight)]/[(total
cpm/total weight) - (nonspecific cpm/nonspecific
weight)]}) x 100.

plasma and brain concentrations

alprazolam, tnazolam, and  xxxd2036xxx  were dissolved in
 xxxd3034xxx  (neat), diluted with saline, and administered intraperitoneally at varying doses. except in time
course experiments, animals received drug i h before they
were killed. control animals received vehicle containing
the highest concentration of  xxxd3034xxx . all injections
were given in a volume of 0.15 ml. ro15-1788 was dissolved in ethanol and diluted with saline. final ethanol
concentrations were <i%.

trunk blood was collected in heparinized tubes. after
centrifugation, plasma was stored at -20°c before assay.
after weighing, brain tissue was placed in 0.5-2 ml of 0.025
m borate buffer, ph 8.3. tissue was homogenized with a
polytron (brinkmann, lucerne, switzerland) at a setting of
7 for four pulses. assays for alprazolam, clonazepam,  xxxd2036xxx , tnazolam, and rol5- 1788 were performed using
gas chromatographic techniques as previously described
(allen et al., 1979; greenblatt et al., 19836; lister et al.,
1984; scavone et al., 1986; miller et al., 1987~).calibration
curves were prepared in both drug-free plasma and brain
homogenate. in all cases, slopes of the calibration curves for
brain and plasma were similar.

receptor binding in vivo

statistical analysis

after pretreatment with drug or vehicle, animals were
injected intravenously via the tail vein with 3 pci of [3h]ro15-1788 in a volume of 0.15 ml of saline (miller et al.,
1987b). after 20 min, animals were killed by decapitation,
trunk blood was collected, and brains were rapidly removed
and dissected on ice. brain regions were then weighed, and

data were analyzed using student’s t test for comparisons between two groups or the mann-whitney test when
distributions were non-gaussian. analysis of variance with
correction for multiple comparisons (dunnett’s test) was
used for comparisons between more than two groups. calculations were performed using the statistical analysis sys-

results
for all three compounds, cortex concentrations
measured 1 h after intraperitoneal dosing were directly proportional to the dose (figs. 1 and 2). after a
single 1 mg/kg dose of alprazolam, cortex and plasma
concentrations declined in parallel over the next 8 h,
with a constant cortex/plasma ratio (1.77 k 0.07;
mean ? sem).
for all three compounds, receptor binding in cortex as determined by the specific uptake of [3h]rol5-1788 decreased with increasing dose (fig. 3).
vehicle ( xxxd3034xxx ) did not affect binding of
[3h]rol5-1788. results for triazolam and  xxxd2036xxx 
were similar to those reported for other benzodiazepines, such as clonazepam and lorazepam (miller et
al., 1987b). however, alprazolam displayed anomalous binding characteristics. at higher doses (0.2- 10
mg/kg), alprazolam affected [3h]rol5- 1788 binding
in a fashion similar to that of other benzodiazepines
in that radioligand binding decreased as alprazolam
dose increased. however, at alprazolam doses of 0.02
and 0.05 mg/kg, radioligand binding was increased
compared with controls. that is, low doses of alprazolam appeared to augment receptor binding, rather
than occupy receptors and decrease binding. nonspe-

cific binding was not changed from controls at these
doses. at even lower doses of alprazolam (10.01
mg/kg), receptor binding was similar to controls, as
would be expected from results with other benzodiazepines. one hour after an alprazolam dose of 0.05
mg/kg, the cortex concentration was 5.3 ? 0.6 ng/g.
although cortex concentrations after 0.02 mg/kg are
not detectable, extrapolation from fig. 1 indicates an
expected concentration of 2.2 ng/g. thus, at cortex
concentrations of 2-6 ng/g, receptor binding appeared to be increased.
receptor binding in various brain regions for animals treated with alprazolam (0.05 mg/kg) indicates
significant increases in binding in hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and hypothalamus (fig. 4). small and
nonsignificant changes were observed in cerebellum,
midbrain, pons-medulla, and striaturn. for triazolam
(0.02 mg/kg), small but nonsignificant increases in
binding compared with vehicle-treated controls were
observed in hippocampus and cortex (data not
shown).
the relation of alprazolam-induced augmentation
in binding and brain alprazolam concentration was
verified following a single dose (1 mg/kg) of alprazolam, after which cortex concentrations and receptor
binding were followed for 12 h. concentrations of
alprazolam in cortex decreased in first-order fashion
for 8 h and thereafter were undetectable (fig. i). receptor binding in cortex increased as alprazolam

mg/kg. binding returned to control values at doses of
<0.01 mg/kg.

concentrations decreased up to 6 h (fig. 5). at 8 and
10 h after administration, specific binding increased
above that of controls, returning to control values at
12 h. increases in benzodiazepine receptor binding
corresponded to cortex concentrations of 6.9 ng/g at
8 h and an extrapolated value of 2.5 ng/g  xxxd1891xxx  h;
concentrations at 12 h are projected to be < 1.5 ng/g.
similar receptor binding results were seen in hypothalamus, with increases above control values at 8
and 10 h and a return to control values at 12 h. in
contrast, in cerebellum and midbrain, receptor binding increased with time, achieving control values at
10 h in both cases (fig. 6).
following a single low dose of alprazolam (0.05
mg/kg), receptor binding in cortex was similar to
controls at 0.5 h but was increased at 1 , 2, and 3 h
(fig. 7). values returned to control levels at 4 h. corresponding alprazolam concentrations in cortex at
0.5, 2, and 3 h were 24, 5.8, and 3.7 ng/g, respectively. alprazolam was undetectable in cortex at 4 h,
but its concentration was projected to be < 1.2 ng/g.
the relation between cortex concentrations and
receptor occupancy for triazolam and  xxxd2036xxx  (fig.
8) appears sigmoidal, as observed with other benzodiazepines. these data can be fitted to the modified hill
equation y = x"/(x" b), and an ic50value can be
calculated (holford and sheiner, 198 1; miller et al.,
19873). the icsovalue for triazolam was 15.6 ngfg,

whereas for  xxxd2036xxx , the icsovalue was 117.3 ng/g.
a similar analysis for alprazolam, excluding points at
which binding is augmented, indicates an approximate icsovalue of 80 ng/g. modified hill plots are
linear for both compounds, with slopes of 1.8 for
 xxxd2036xxx  and 3.3 for triazolam. a hill coefficient
was not calculated for alprazolam because of the presence of data points greater than control binding.
affinity for clonazepam was determined in animals pretreated with alprazolam (0.05 mg/kg) compared with control animals (miller et al., 19873).
characteristic sigmoidal functions are generated (fig.
9), which are similar for alprazolam-treated and untreated animals. the ics0value for clonazepam in
alprazolam-treated animals was 2 1.7 ng/g, and that
for control animals was 20.2 ng/g. there appears to
be little change in receptor affinity, as determined by
affinity for clonazepam, in alprazolam-treated animals. thus, the increase in receptor binding seen at
low doses of alprazolam is most likely due to an increase in receptor number.
to exclude altered nonspecific uptake of
ro 15-1788 as a mechanism of apparently increased
receptor binding, we treated animals with alprazolam
(0.05 mg/kg) as above and substituted ro 15-1788 (6
mg/kg) for the radioligand. this dose of ro 15-1788 is
sufficient to saturate receptors (miller et ai., 19873).

increase in nonspecific binding was observed following low doses (0.05 mg/kg) of alprazolam.

ceptor binding (compared with control) in cortex and
hippocampus, but these did not achieve significance.
compared with other benzodiazepines, alprazolam
exhibits unusual binding characteristics. at higher
doses and brain concentrations, alprazolam is similar
to other agents. however, 1 h after doses of 0.05 and
0.02 mg/kg, corresponding to cortex concentrations
of 2-6 ng/g, receptor binding increases above control
values in cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus.
that is, at these doses, alprazolam does not appear to
occupy receptors, but rather receptor binding is increased, apparently because of an increase in receptor
number rather than receptor affinity. time course
studies confirm the effects of alprazolam at these
brain concentrations. determinations of receptor
binding after a single dose of alprazolam ( 1 mg/kg)
indicate augmentation of binding in cortex and hypothalamus (but not cerebellum or midbrain) at 8-10 h
after dosing, corresponding to cortex concentrations
of 2.5-7 ng/g. receptor binding in cortex after a single dose of 0.05 mg/kg was augmented at 1,2, and 3 h
after dosing, corresponding to cortex concentrations
of 3.7-5.8 ng/g. although it is possible that the acute
response to a low dose and the delayed response to a
higher dose of alprazolam have different mechanisms, a reasonable hypothesis is that alterations in
receptor binding are related to tissue concentrations.
in conjunction with dose-response data, these time
course experiments suggest that receptor binding is

discussion
 xxxd2036xxx  and triazolam display similar binding
characteristics in vivo when compared with other
benzodiazepines such as clonazepam and lorazepam
(miller et al., 19876). that is, increasing the dose of
either drug results in greater receptor occupancy and,
therefore, decreased radioligand binding in vivo. the
brain concentration versus receptor occupancy relationship is described by a modified hill equation,
consistent with accepted principles of drug-receptor
binding (holford and sheiner, 1981). triazolam was
substantially more potent than  xxxd2036xxx , with respective ics0 values of 15.6 and 117.3 ng/g. triazolam has greater affinity than clonazepam (icso = 21
ng/g), whereas  xxxd2036xxx  and lorazepam (icso= 107
ng/g) are comparable. triazolam is unusual among
benzodiazepines studied in vivo in that its hill coefficient is substantially greater (3.3) than that of clonazepam, lorazepam, or  xxxd2036xxx  (all l .3- l .8). the
significance of hill coefficients obtained in vivo remains uncertain. furthermore, at a triazolam dose of
0.02 mg/kg, there were trends toward increased re-

augmented at alprazolam concentrations of 2-7 ng/g
and that this anomalous augmentation of binding is
not observed at concentrations of >20 or <2 ng/g.
in vitro studies do not suggest unusual benzodiazepine receptor binding characteristics for alprazolam.
several groups have reported that alprazolam was
similar to other benzodiazepines in binding to brain
membranes at 0°c (kochman and hirsch, 1981;
sethy and hams, 1982~;sethy et al., 1983). triazolam receptor affinity was substantially greater than
that of alprazolam (ki = 0.5 vs. 3.4 nm). in one
study, a large dose of alprazolam (50 mg/kg) in rats
produced an increase in receptor number in membranes washed with water but not buffer (sethy and
hams, 1982b).a similar increase was seen with diazepam, and the authors concluded that these changes
were an artifact of the washing procedure.
the interpretation of these in vitro findings is uncertain. the high potency of triazolam in vivo, despite the lack of “gaba-shift” in vitro, is at variance
with the hypothesis that the degree of gaba-shift
correlates with the clinical effect (ehlert et al., 1983;
chweh et al., 1984). in vitro binding studies are lim-

ited by possible effects of tissue preparation, removal
of gaba, and temperature and buffer conditions
(doble, 1983; miller et al., 1987a). use of in vivo
binding techniques may avoid some limitations inherent in in vitro techniques.
our results in vivo yield relative icso values for
triazolam and alprazolam similar to their relative ki
values in vitro. triazolam receptor binding in vivo is
generally similar to that of other benzodiazepines,
such as clonazepam or lorazepam, although the hill
coefficient and binding at low doses may indicate
unique properties. with regard to effects of gaba on
triazolam binding, the existence of a “gaba-shift”
in vivo is uncertain, as are specific effects of gaba
on triazolam. also, in contrast to in vitro results,
alprazolam binds anomalously in vivo. at several low
doses, alprazolam appears to increase receptor number in cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus but
not in cerebellum, midbrain, pons-medulla, or striatum. no structural reason for this effect of alprazolam is evident, because alprazolam differs from  xxxd2036xxx  only by a methyl group and from triazolam by
a chloride substitution. it can be speculated that al-

triazolobenzodiazepine receptor binding
prazolam might alter benzodiazepine receptor binding indirectly through effects on adrenergic function
(sethy and hodges, 1982; eriksson et al., 1986).
however, the relation between the adrenergic and
benzodiazepine systems remains uncertain. it is unlikely that metabolites of the triazolobenzodiazepines
substantially affect receptor binding or account for
the unusual binding properties of alprazolam. currently available data suggest that the metabolic products are hydroxylated, are present largely in conjugated form, and have considerably lower pharmacologic activity compared with the parent compounds.
as such, metabolites are unlikely to be present in
significant concentrations in brain or to influence ligand binding.
the pharmacodynamic effects of increased receptor binding such as that induced by alprazolam are
uncertain. barbiturates and ethanol increase benzodiazepine receptor binding, with accompanying sedation and anxiolytic effects. stress also produces increased receptor binding (miller et al., 1987d,e).
there is evidence that each of these stimuli promotes
chloride flux through the chloride ionophore associated with the gaba-benzodiazepinecomplex (havoundjian et al., 1986; suzdak et al., 1986). it is possible that the unusual in vivo receptor binding properties of alprazolam result in altered chloride flux,
contributing to the apparently unique clinical effects
observed with this compound.
