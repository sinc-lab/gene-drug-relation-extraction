abstract
 xxxd2142xxx , a neuroleptic drug which is used clinically to treat schizophrenic patients, is a  xxxg656xxx  antagonist. besides its well-known actions
on the dopamine receptors,  xxxd2142xxx  also displays calcium channel-blocking activity.
the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of  xxxd2142xxx  on the  xxxd1804xxx 
(4ap)-evoked glutamate release in the cerebrocortical nerve terminals (synaptosomes).
 xxxd2142xxx  reduced 4ap-evoked glutamate release in a concentration-dependent manner. this inhibitory effect was associated with a decrease in the depolarization-evoked
increase in the cytoplasmic free ca2⫹ concentration ([ca2⫹]c), which could be completely
abolished by the ca2⫹ channel blocker ␻-cgtx gvia. furthermore,  xxxd2142xxx  did not
produce any effect on  xxxd2379xxx -evoked glutamate release. these results suggest that
 xxxd2142xxx  inhibits glutamate release primarily by reducing presynaptic ca2⫹ influx via
n-type ca2⫹ channels in rat cerebrocortical nerve terminals. this finding implies that
presynaptic ca2⫹ channel blockade concomitant with inhibition of glutamate release
and possibly other neurotransmitters release may contribute to the antischizophrenic
action of  xxxd2142xxx . synapse 44:36 – 41, 2002. © 2002 wiley-liss, inc.

introduction
glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter
in the brain. several lines of evidence suggest an important role for glutamate in psychiatric disorders such
as schizophrenia, anxiety, and depression (wiley et al.,
1995; skolnick et al., 1996; danysz and parsons, 1998;
skolnick, 1999).  xxxd2142xxx , a member of the diphenylbutylpiperidine (dpbp) class of neuroleptic drugs,
has been used clinically to treat schizophrenic symptoms for many years. its antischizophrenic action is
thought to involve blockade of dopamine receptors, especially in the dopamine d2 receptors (seeman, 1981;
hassel, 1985). interestingly, a number of studies have
shown that  xxxd2142xxx  also has inhibitory properties
at the ca2⫹ channels (gould et al., 1983; galizzi et al.,
1986; sah and bean, 1994; grantham et al., 1994; ito et
al., 1996). for example, sah and bean (1994) demonstrated that p-type ca2⫹ channels in cerebellar purkinje neurons and n-type ca2⫹ channels in sympathetic neurons were inhibited by  xxxd2142xxx . in view of
the fact that neurotransmitter release is initiated by an
influx of ca2⫹ through voltage-dependent ca2⫹ channels (linas et al., 1981; miller, 1987), our particular
interest was to elucidate the presynaptic action of  xxxd2142xxx  in cerebrocortical synaptosomes.

the isolated nerve terminal preparation (synaptosomes) represents a well-established model for studying the presynaptic regulation of neurotransmitter release by drugs or modulators in the absence of any
complication of interpretation produced by concomitant postsynaptic effects (sihra et al., 1993). using the
synaptosomal model, we therefore investigated the effect of  xxxd2142xxx  on 4ap-evoked release of glutamate.
we found that  xxxd2142xxx  inhibits 4ap-evoked glutamate release from cerebrocortical synaptosomes
through a reduction of ca2⫹ entry and this inhibition is
suppressed by the n-type ca2⫹ channel blocker ␻-conotoxin-gvia but not by ␻-agatoxin-via. we also demonstrated that  xxxd2142xxx -mediated inhibition of glutamate release is not due to a direct effect on the
release machinery, because  xxxd2142xxx  failed to affect
 xxxd2379xxx -evoked glutamate release.

 xxxd2142xxx  modulation of glutamate release

materials and methods
preparation of synaptosomes
synaptosomes were prepared from the cerebral cortices of 2-month-old male sprague-dawley rats. the
final synaptosomal pellet was resuspended in incubation buffer (hbm) consisting of 140 mm nacl, 5 mm
kcl, 5 mm nahco3, 1 mm mgcl2 䡠 6h2o, 1.2 mm
na2hpo4, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm hepes, and 1
mg/ml bsa (ph 7.4) and protein concentration determined using the bradford assay. synaptosomes were
centrifuged in the final wash to obtain synaptosomal
pellets with 0.3 mg protein. synaptosomal pellets were
stored on ice and used within 2–3 h.
glutamate release assay
glutamate release was assayed by on-line fluorimetry as described previously (nicholls and sihra. 1986).
synaptosomal pellets were resuspended in incubation
buffer in a stirred and thermostatted cuvette maintained at 37°c in a perkin-elmer ls-50b spectrofluorimeter. nadp⫹ (1 mm), glutamate dehydrogenase
( xxxg911xxx   xxxg1010xxx   xxxg2377xxx ; 50 units/ml), and cacl2 (1 mm) were added
after 5 min. after a further 10 min of incubation, 3 mm
 xxxd1804xxx  was added to depolarize synaptosomes. glutamate release was monitored by measuring the increase
of fluorescence (excitation and emission wavelengths of
340 and 460 nm, respectively) due to nadph being
produced by the oxidative deamination of released glutamate by  xxxg911xxx   xxxg1010xxx   xxxg2377xxx . data were accumulated at 2-sec intervals. a standard of exogenous glutamate (5 nmol)
was added at the end of each experiment and the fluorescence change produced by the standard addition
was used to calculate the released glutamate as nmol
glutamate/mg synaptosomal protein. cumulative data
were analyzed using lotus 1-2-3.

materials
 xxxd2142xxx  was obtained from research biochemicals international (natick, ma, usa). fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2-am) was obtained from molecular probes (eugene, or, usa). percoll was
obtained from pharmacia (uppsala, sweden). glutamate dehydrogenase ( xxxg911xxx   xxxg1010xxx   xxxg2377xxx ) and all other reagents
were obtained from sigma (poole, uk) or merck (poole,
uk).
results
effect of  xxxd2142xxx  on the 4ap-evoked
glutamate release
the depolarization of nerve terminals with the k⫹
channel blocker 4ap has been shown to open voltagegated ca2⫹ channels and to induce the release of vesicular glutamate (tibbs et al., 1989). the stimulation
produced by 4ap closely simulates physiological stimulation and is therefore extensively used in synaptosomal studies as a depolarization agent. to gain insight
into the mechanisms underlying modulation of glutamate release by  xxxd2142xxx , we first investigated the
effect of  xxxd2142xxx  on 4ap-evoked glutamate release
from cerebrocortical nerve terminals. under control
conditions, application of 4ap (3 mm) evoked a glutamate release of 28.9 ⫾ 2.5 nmol/mg/5 min from synaptosomes incubated in the presence of 1 mm cacl2.
preincubation of synaptosomes with  xxxd2142xxx  (5
␮m) significantly reduced the release of glutamate to
15.2 ⫾ 1.5 nmol/mg/5 min (fig. 1a). figure 1b shows
that the inhibition produced by  xxxd2142xxx  was concentration dependent, with 1, 5, and 10 ␮m  xxxd2142xxx 
inhibiting glutamate release by 27 ⫾ 2%, 46 ⫾ 4%, and
59 ⫾ 5%, respectively.

effects of  xxxd2142xxx  on [ca2ⴙ]c and
 xxxd2379xxx -evoked glutamate release

synaptosomes (0.3 mg/ml) were preincubated in
hbm containing 5 ␮m fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester, 0.1
mm cacl2, and 16 ␮m bsa for 30 min at 37°c in a
stirred test tube. after fura-2 loading, synaptosomes
were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 30 sec at
10,000g. the synaptosomal pellets were resuspended
in hbm at 37°c and the synaptosomal suspension
stirred in a thermostatted cuvette in a perkin-elmer
ls-3b spectrofluorimeter. cacl2 (1 mm) was added
after 3 min and further additions were made after an
additional 5 min, as described in the legends to the
figures. fura-2-ca fluorescence were accumulated at
excitation wavelengths of 340 nm and 380 nm (emission wavelength 505 nm) at data accumulated at
3.5-sec intervals. cytosolic free ca2⫹ concentration
([ca2⫹]c, nm) was calculated by using calibration procedures and equations described by previously (sihra
et al., 1993). cumulative data were analyzed using
lotus 1-2-3.

a reduction in the ca2⫹-dependent release of glutamate can be explained by decreased entry of ca2⫹
through the voltage-sensitive ca2⫹ channels which are
coupled to glutamate exocytosis in the nerve terminals.
to assess whether  xxxd2142xxx  reduces the influx of
ca2⫹, we determined [ca2⫹]c using the ca2⫹ indicator
fura-2. 4ap (3 mm) caused a rise in [ca2⫹]c to a plateau level of 352.5⫾ 8.4 nm. as illustrated in figure 2,
the 4ap-evoked rise in [ca2⫹]c was markedly reduced
with  xxxd2142xxx  preincubation.
to determine whether the inhibition of glutamate
release by  xxxd2142xxx  occurred downstream of ca2⫹
entry, we triggered transmitter release using the ca2⫹
ionophore  xxxd2379xxx  (5 ␮m), which causes a direct
increase in intrasynaptosomal ca2⫹ levels without previous depolarization and ca2⫹ channel activation (sihra et al., 1993).  xxxd2379xxx  caused a ca2⫹-dependent
glutamate release of 28.9 ⫾ 1.7 nmol/mg/5 min. in the
presence of  xxxd2142xxx ,  xxxd2379xxx -induced release of

synaptosomes (0.3 mg/ml) were incubated as described in methods
and [ca2⫹]c was monitored using fura-2. voltage-dependent ca2⫹
influx was evoked by 4ap in the absence or presence of  xxxd2142xxx  (5
␮m). data represent mean ⫾ sem of five independent synaptosomal
preparations. error bars are shown every 10 sec for clarity. [ca2⫹]c in

(student’s two-tailed paired t-test, p ⬍ 0.01).

glutamate was not significantly changed (28.3 ⫾ 1.2

were preincubated for 10 min under standard conditions in the absence (control) or presence of  xxxd2142xxx  followed by the addition of a
stimulator. glutamate release was assayed by on-line fluorimetry.
data represent mean ⫾ sem of independent experiments carried out
with individual synaptosomal preparations from the indicated number of animals (n). mean ⫾ sem were obtained for each data point (2

neurotransmitter release in the presence of  xxxd2142xxx  was significantly different from control release (student’s two-tailed paired ttest, p ⬍ 0.01).

glutamate release is primarily coupled to the entry
of ca2⫹ through both n- and p/q-type ca2⫹ channels
(luebke et al., 1993; mintz et al., 1995; turner and
dunlap, 1995; vazquez and sanchez-prieto, 1997),
which can be selectively blocked by ␻-conotoxin-gvia
and by ␻-agatoxin-iva, respectively (olivera et al.,
1985; mintz et al., 1995). to establish which ca2⫹
channel subtype was responsible for  xxxd2142xxx -mediated inhibition, we examined glutamate release in the
presence of ca2⫹ channel toxins. in control experiments, the release evoked by 4ap (3 mm; 30.4 ⫾ 3.4
nmol/mg/5 min) was reduced by ␻-conotoxin-gvia (2
␮m) or ␻-agatoxin-iva (200 nm) to 17.2 ⫾ 0.8 and

14.2 ⫾ 1.1 nmol/mg/5 min, respectively (fig. 4b). this
result is consistent with previous study indicating that
both n- and p/q-type ca2⫹ channels participate in
transmitter release. we next assessed the effect of
␻-conotoxin-gvia on  xxxd2142xxx -mediated inhibition.
figure 4a shows that in the absence of ca2⫹ channel
toxins,  xxxd2142xxx  reduced the 4ap-evoked release to
15.7 ⫾ 1.2 nmol/mg/5 min. however, the inhibition
of 4ap-evoked release by  xxxd2142xxx  was abolished
in synaptosomes pretreated with ␻-conotoxin-gvia
(15.4 ⫾ 2.1 nmol/mg/5 min; fig. 4a). in contrast,  xxxd2142xxx  further reduced the release to 10.3 ⫾ 1.6
nmol/mg/5 min in the presence of ␻-agatoxin-iva (fig.
4b). these results suggest the involvement of n-type
ca2⫹ channels in the action of  xxxd2142xxx .
discussion
our results demonstrate that  xxxd2142xxx  inhibits
4ap-evoked glutamate release from cerebrocortical
nerve terminals (synaptosomes). the observation that
 xxxd2142xxx -mediated inhibition of glutamate release is
not due to a direct effect on the release machinery but

results from a reduction of n-type ca2⫹ channel activity and subsequently a decrease in the influx of ca2⫹
into nerve terminal. this finding is consistent with
previous electrophysiological data showing that  xxxd2142xxx  inhibited synaptic transmission by reducing presynaptic ca2⫹ currents in central neurons (wang et al.,
1997). however, in that study the effect of  xxxd2142xxx 
on transmitter release was detected indirectly by looking at changes in postsynaptic responses. here, we
used the synaptosomal model to directly investigate
the regulation of glutamate exocytosis by  xxxd2142xxx .
mechanisms of  xxxd2142xxx -mediated inhibition
of glutamate release
since glutamate exocytosis is triggered by a localized
increase in [ca2⫹]c, a reduction in ca2⫹ entry into the
nerve terminal decreases glutamate release (sihra et
al., 1992). in addition, presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmitter release could result from a direct effect on
the release processes (wu and saggau, 1997; macdermott et al., 1999). in this study, we show that  xxxd2142xxx  inhibited glutamate release evoked by the k⫹
channel blocker 4ap. moreover,  xxxd2142xxx  inhibited
the evoked increase in [ca2⫹]c. these data are consistent with a reduction in the activity of ca2⫹ channels
coupled to glutamate exocytosis and is in agreement
with previous electrophysiological data showing that
 xxxd2142xxx  blocks ca2⫹ currents in many preparations
(enyeart et al., 1990; sah and bean, 1994; grantham
et al., 1994; ito et al., 1996). on the other hand, we
directly determined whether  xxxd2142xxx  possesses a
direct modulation on release machinery by using  xxxd2379xxx , a ca2⫹ ionophore, to induce ca2⫹ entry into
synaptosomes.  xxxd2142xxx  had no effect on the  xxxd2379xxx -induced glutamate release, suggesting therefore
that the  xxxd2142xxx -mediated inhibition of glutamate
release is not a consequence of an action downstream of
ca2⫹ entry. in addition to affecting presynaptic ca2⫹
channels, activation of na⫹ channels or inhibition of
k⫹ channels is known to regulate the amount of neurotransmitter release (li et al., 1993; rehm and tempel, 1991; sihra and nichols, 1993). therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that  xxxd2142xxx  may
possess additional mechanisms such as inhibition of
presynaptic na⫹ channels or activation of k⫹ channels.
 xxxd2142xxx -mediated inhibition of release is
blocked by n-type ca2ⴙ channel antagonist
in nerve terminals, glutamate release is induced by
the entry of ca2⫹ through n- and p/q-type ca2⫹ channels. in the present study, we have demonstrated that
 xxxd2142xxx  inhibited the glutamate release evoked by
4ap in cerebrocortical nerve terminals. importantly,
this inhibitory effect was blocked by the n-type ca2⫹
channel blocker ␻-conotoxin-gvia but not by the p/qtype ca2⫹ channel blocker ␻-agatoxin-iva. the addi-

tivity in the inhibitory actions of  xxxd2142xxx  and
␻-agatoxin-iva on glutamate release can be explained
by the inhibition of a different ca2⫹ channel population
by both compounds, whereas the lack of additivity in
the actions of  xxxd2142xxx  and ␻-conotoxin-gvia can be
explained by the inhibition of the same ca2⫹ channelcoupled release components by both compounds. therefore, these results suggest that the central action of
 xxxd2142xxx  may be due, at least in part, to modulation
of neurotransmitter release through an effect on ntype ca2⫹ channels. this hypothesis is supported by
previous studies (grantham et al., 1994; sah and bean,
1994), which demonstrated that  xxxd2142xxx  blocks ntype ca2⫹ channels.
functional implications
at many synapses in the central nerve system, neurotransmitter release from the nerve terminal is controlled by multiple mechanisms. an enhanced release
of glutamate has been implicated in a number of pathophysiologic conditions such as ischemic brain damage
and status epilepticus (meldrum and garthwaite,
1990; beal, 1992; loscher, 1993).  xxxd2142xxx  has been
proposed to play a neuroprotective role by decreasing
glutamate release (wang et al., 1997). accordingly, the
ability of  xxxd2142xxx  to block evoked glutamate release
via a presynaptic blockade of n-type ca2⫹ channels
might suggest the potential use of derivatives of  xxxd2142xxx  as a neuroprotective agent, especially in
pathological situation where excessive glutamate release occurs.
