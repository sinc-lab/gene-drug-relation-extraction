a b s t r a c t
serotonin transporter (sert) has been associated with drugs of abuse like  xxxd2589xxx  (meth).
meth is well known to produce effects on the monoamine systems but it is unclear how meth affects
sert and memory. here the effects of meth and the serotonin reuptake inhibitor ﬂuoxetine (flx) on
autoshaping and novel object recognition (nor) were investigated. notably, both memory tasks recruit
different behavioral, neural and cognitive demand. in autoshaping task a dose–response curve for meth
was determined. meth (1.0 mg/kg) impaired short-term memory (stm; lasting less of 90 min) in nor
and impaired both stm and long-term memory (ltm; lasting 24 and 48 h) in autoshaping, indicating that
meth had long-lasting effects in the latter task. a comparative autoradiography study of the relationship
between the binding pattern of sert in autoshaping new untrained vs. trained treated (meth, flx, or
both) animals was made. considering that hemispheric dominance is important for ltm, hence right
vs. left hemisphere of the brain was compared. results showed that trained animals decreased cortical
sert binding relative to untrained ones. in untrained and trained treated animals with the amnesic dose
(1.0 mg/kg) of meth sert binding in several areas including hippocampus and cortex decreased, more
remarkably in the trained animals. in contrast, flx improved memory, increased sert binding, prevented
the meth amnesic effect and re-established the sert binding. in general, memory and amnesia seemed
to make sert more vulnerable to drugs effects.

1. introduction
drugs of abuse like  xxxd2589xxx  (meth) and (+/−)3,4methylenedioxymethamphetamine (mdma, “ecstasy”) reduce
brain serotonin transporter (sert) density and provoke memory
deﬁcits [1–3,88]. indeed, prior exposure to mdma signiﬁcantly
diminished the correlation with cortical sert binding and also
in abstinent ecstasy users impaired memory and reduced sert
binding [1]. importantly, meth has effects on dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin transporters and receptors (see e.g., [4,5]).
interestingly, the serotonin and dopamine systems interact during memory formation (see [6]). serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine
(5-ht) pathways project [7,8] to brain areas implicated in memory, including neocortex and hippocampus [9]. growing evidence
indicates that via multiple 5-ht receptors [10] and sert, this
monoamine plays a role in cognitive processes (see e.g., [11–13]).
notably, the sert binding is found to be decreased in patients with
alzheimer’s disease (ad) into brain areas such as hippocampus,
frontal, temporal and entorhinal cortices as well as raphe nuclei

[14–19]. unfortunately, it is unclear if the loss of sert is related to
memory deﬁcits or serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) could be
useful in the treatment of memory deﬁcits of ad-patients. notably,
pharmacological and genetic manipulations of sert modify memory performance in several behavioral tasks (see e.g., [13,20–25]).
for instance, immediately post-training administration of ssri like
ﬂuoxetine improved memory consolidation in learning tasks such
as passive avoidance [26] and autoshaping [27]. in addition, the
sert-deﬁcient and sert over-expressing mouse [28] and rat models offer excellent new light. for instance, sert knockout (−/−) rats
that received acute tryptophan depletion (atd) relative to wildtype (sert+/+ ), both show transiently lowered central serotonin
levels and impaired short-term memory (stm; lasting for minutes to hours) in the novel object recognition task (nor; [29]). as
it is unclear whether memory affects sert or vice versa, hence,
in this paper the aim was to investigate, on the one hand the
interaction between meth and ﬂuoxetine (flx) on cognitive functions of rats in two behavioral tests; and on the other hand, the
relationship between the binding pattern of sert in untrained
vs. trained injected animals with saline, meth, flx, or flx plus
meth. since changes in sert have also been reported in brain
areas linked to amnesia and ad (see above), it seems appropriate
to use behavioral tasks involving diverse brain areas and cognitive
demand.

2. experimental procedure
2.1. materials and methods

fig. 1. experimental design of control and experimental untrained, autoshaping
trained and nor groups.

2.1.1. subjects
the experimental protocol was approved by an institutional review committee
(cicual; project no. 047/02) for the use of animal subjects in compliance with the
national institutes of health guide for care and use of laboratory animals (publication no. 85-23, revised 1985). male wistar rats (12 weeks old) were collectively
housed (home cage measuring 60 × 40.7 = 2442 cm2 , allowing 244 cm2 per animal
of (300 g bodyweight) in a temperature and light-controlled room under a 12:12 h
light–dark cycle (light on  xxxd2274xxx :00 a.m.). water and food were provided ad libitum
for autoshaping trained and untrained as well as nor animals. after that period, as
in other experiments [43,92] for the autoshaping trained and untrained animals,
their body weights were reduced to 85% by gradually reducing the food intake
during 7 days. to the end of each day of autoshaping experiments, untrained and
trained animals received access to food during 30 min. separate animals were used
for autoshaping and nor tasks.
2.2. autoshaping task

many behavioral tasks covering a wide variety of behaviors
and processes are subsumed under the banner of ‘memory’ (see
[30–32,91]). of these tasks, autoshaping [33] and nor (see below),
recruit different behavioral, neural, and cognitive demands (see
[12,91]), despite the differences both tasks have been used for
assessing nor stm and/or long-term memory (ltm) (see e.g.,
[34,35]) and autoshaping stm and ltm (lasting days to months).
research groups have reported that autoshaping modulated the
binding of protein 5-ht1a and 5-ht2a receptors in hippocampus
and cortex, the dissociation of the orbitofrontal and infralimbic
cortex contribution, etc. (for references see [12]). frequently comparable results of those found in autoshaping have been reported
in memory tasks such as passive avoidance, novel object recognition, social recognition, morris water maze, etc. (for review see
[91]). the rationale of choosing autoshaping is that diverse evidence
supports the notion that autoshaping is an associative learning task
and involves brain areas implicated in declarative/explicit (i.e., hippocampus) and non-declarative/implicit (i.e., striatum) memory
([12,13,36]; however, see [11]). therefore, the autoshaping task
was used to determine a dose–response curve for meth. next,
the autoshaping and nor were used to test the ssri ﬂuoxetine
(10.0 mg/kg), the drug of abuse meth (effective dose 1.0 mg/kg)
and their co-administration (fig. 1). fluoxetine dose was based on
full dose–response studies (see [23,27]), where a memory facilitation effect was observed. as already mentioned stm lasted
less 90 min, no required hippocampal translations or transduction but is dependent on prefrontal cortex mechanisms, ltm is
deﬁned as lasting longer that 24 h, requiring hippocampal protein
and mrna synthesis within 6 h following training [22,37,38]. in
the nor task, meth (1.0 mg/kg) only decreased performance of
stm, nevertheless, impaired performance of both stm and ltm in
the autoshaping task. this indicates that meth had long-lasting
effect in the autoshaping task; therefore, new autoshaping trained
saline, ﬂuoxetine, meth and ﬂuoxetine–meth groups were used
for the autoradiography study. besides these groups, untrained
and trained saline or meth groups were included. twenty-eight
brain areas were selected (see table 1) since they are important for memory [9,13] and/or present serotonergic projections
(see [7]). finally, as there are differential roles of right and left
sides of the brain in memory formation [39] and pharmacological effects [40], herein in order to get some insights in the
hemispherical dominance the right vs. the left hemispheres were
compared. notably, hemispheric dominance (i.e., hemispheric specialization) is important in processes such as semantic processes,
working memory and ltm (see e.g., [41]). we hypothesized that
memory, amnesia and pharmacological manipulation of sert
affect sert binding and hemispherical dominance. part of this

in an autoshaping or sign-tracking setting, a hungry animal is placed in a
conditioning chamber to ﬁnd food pellets (unconditioned stimulus [us]) in the
food-magazine and is then given a pavlovian sequential pairing (stimulus–stimulus
[s–s]) of a lighted key [33] or a retractable-illuminated lever (conditioned stimulus [cs]) and food (us). after a number of such presentations, the animal
approaches the cs and presents instrumental responses (conditioned response
[cr]), such as peck, nose-poke, and contact- or lever-press. it should be noted that
for the pavlovian autoshaping procedure [33] pigeons were exposed to repeated
(response-independent) presentations of food after the response key was illuminated momentarily. importantly, within the continued progress of behavioral task
development, a pavlovian/instrumental (p/i) autoshaping task combines both pavlovian and instrumental conditioning [36,93] where the presentation of an illuminable
retractable lever for 8 s (cs) is followed by the delivery of a food pellet (us) with an
inter-trial interval of 60 s. when the animal presents a lever-press response to the
cs, the lever is retracted, the light is turned off, a food pellet (us) is immediately
delivered and it is considered as a conditioned response (cr). if the animal fails to
present the cr, the cs lasts 8 s and in the end of this period the us is delivered. thus
animal is exposed to both pavlovian and instrumental conditioning.
2.2.1. apparatus
operant chambers (coulbourn instruments) for rats with standard soundattenuation were used. chambers were 25 cm wide, 29 cm long and 25 cm high with
a ﬂoor of bars. a retractable lever was mounted 4 cm above the ﬂoor and 10 cm from
the right and left walls. the lever required a 10 g force for operation. a food-magazine
was located 5 cm to the right of the lever and 3 cm above the ﬂoor. a house light
was located in the right top corner. solid-state programming equipment was used
for control and recording (coulbourn instruments, lehigh valley, pa, usa).
2.2.2. autoshaping training
each rat was placed into an experimental chamber and allowed to habituate
until the animal found and ate 50 food pellets (45 mg each pellet) and presented
150 head-pokes to collect the food pellet previously placed into the food-magazine.
a house light provided general illumination and remained turn on all the session.
immediately thereafter, the autoshaping program began and it consisted in the presentation of an illuminable retractable lever for 8 s (cs), followed by the delivery of
a food pellet (us) with an inter-trial interval of 60 s. when the animal presented a
lever-press response to the cs, the lever was retracted, the light was turned off, a
food pellet was immediately delivered and it was considered as a cr. if the animal
failed to present the cr, the cs lasted 8 s and in the end of this period the us was
delivered. the increase or decrement in the percentage of cr was considered an
index of learning. the autoshaping training session consisted of 10 (lasting (12 min)
trials and stm and ltm sessions of 20 (lasting nearly 24 min) trials. compounds
were injected immediately after the autoshaping training session and animals were
tested 1.5, 24 and 48 h later. for autoshaping experiments a between subjects design
was used. considering the number of animals used, experiments were carried out
in separate cohorts, in which each treatment condition of testing was presented for
each one. in order to rule out unrelated factors to memory, several precautions were
taken, including the tissue comparison from the animal groups at the time they were
simultaneously processed and factors other than memory per se, such as stress, age
and weight, were controlled (e.g., by daily handled them, using animals of the same
age).
2.2.3. measurements and analysis
crs were transformed to a percentage of total trials fro each session. multiple
group comparisons were made using anova followed by the tukey test. in all statistical comparisons, p < 0.05 was used as criterion for signiﬁcance. the n per group

us [22,23] and others (see e.g., [44,45]).

drug (or drugs) administration

2.3. novel object recognition task

2.4.2. autoradiography
2.4.2.1. preparation of brains. immediately following the last autoshaping session,
animals were sacriﬁced by decapitation; their brains were removed and placed on
ice. for autoradiography assay, brains were quickly frozen in pulverized dry ice
and stored at −70 ◦ c until used. for sert autoradiography study, coronal sections
through the rat brain were cut at 20 m in a cryostat (leica model cm 1510-3), thawmounted on gelatin-coated slides, and stored at −70 ◦ c until the day of incubation.
distance between consecutive sections was of 260 ␮m. the tissue was re-hydrated
at room temperature only during the ligand incubation.

the nor task was conducted as reported by ennaceur and delacour [46],
assessed non-spatial hippocampal-dependent memory [47,86]. the nor capitalizes on the fact that rats will explore novelty in a familiar environment and requires
the rats to recall which of two objects they had been previously exposed to. thus,
time spent into exploring the novel object is regarded as recognition memory. the
nor task took place in an open box (44 × 49 × 44) built of transparent acrylic. the
familiarization phase (fam) was conducted by placing individual rats for 5 min into
the box, in which two different objects (objects a and b) were positioned in two
adjacent corners. rats were then removed, immediately injected intraperitoneally
(i.p.), and returned to their home cages. in a stm test given 90 min or ltm test given
24 and 48 h later after familiarization, the rats explored the box for 3 min in the
presence of one familiar (a) and one novel (c) objects. different novel objects were
used in the stm and ltm testing. objects were made of metal and were chosen after
determining that they were equally preferred; familiar and novel object locations
were counterbalanced across animals and to each animal the familiar and novel
object were different. between each trial both the box and the objects were washed
with 50%  xxxd102xxx  to eliminate any odor signal. all sessions were videotaped.
exploration was deﬁned as snifﬁng or touching the object with the nose to a distance
equivalent or less than 2 cm; sitting on the object and/or turning around was not
considered exploration. the proportion of the total exploration time that the animal spent investigating the novel object was the index of recognition memory. an
exploration quotient (eq) calculated for each animal was expressed by the ratio of
the time spent exploring the object a or familiar (ta), the time spent exploring the
object c or novel (tc); i.e., tc/(ta + tc). an eq score of 0.5 indicates chance performance (i.e., zero discrimination between the two objects at stm phase) or amnesic
effect. an eq > 0.5 indicates more time exploring the novel object. the n per group
was 7 and the same animals were used for stm and ltm.
2.4. nor statistical analysis
analysis within-group comparisons of time spent exploring each object on
either the stm test or ltm test sessions was done using paired-samples t-tests.
eq scores were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (anova). tukey test
was used for post-hoc eq treatment group comparisons.
2.4.1. drug treatment
the drugs used were: saline, ﬂuoxetine hcl (10.0 mg/kg) (eli lilly, indianapolis),
meth (1.0–10.0 mg/kg; from pharmacobiology department, cinvestav). all drugs
were dissolved in physiological saline and were injected (i.p.) in a volume of 1 ml/kg.
for autoshaping task a dose–response curve (1.0–10.0 mg/kg) for meth was determined. in the following experiments for autoshaping and nor tasks animals were
given post-training administration of ﬂuoxetine (10.0 mg/kg), meth (1.0 mg/kg) and
their co-administration (ﬂuoxetine 3 min later followed by meth administration).
the autoshaping trained animals were used for the autoradiography study and were

2.4.2.2. sert autoradiography. following rocha et al. [48] for sert autoradiographic
study a concentration of [3 h] citalopram (perkin elmer) 2 nm was used. tissue
sections were washed in coplin jars for 30 min at room temperature in buffer solution consisting of 50 mm tris–hcl, 50 mm  xxxd3449xxx -base and 120 mm nacl, ph 7.4.
then, sections were incubated for 60 min at room temperature in the same buffer
containing the radioligand, [3 h] citalopram, at a ﬁnal 2 nm concentration (speciﬁc activity 81.2 ci/mmol). non-speciﬁc binding was previously generated by the
addition of ﬂuoxetine 10 ␮m and a parallel group of slides were run to visualize
non-speciﬁc binding in each group or region (see fig. 5). after incubation, the sections were washed in ice-cold (4 ◦ c) buffer solution twice for 1 min and then quickly
dipped into cold distilled water to remove any remaining salts. the sections were
dried under gentle stream of cool air. the slides were arrayed in cassettes for xrays (biomax 20.3 cm × 24.5 cm) together with tritium standards (amersham) and
exposed to tritium-sensitive ﬁlm (biomax mr-2 kodak hyperﬁlm) at room temperature for 6 weeks. the ﬁlms were developed using kodak d11 developer and
ﬁxer at room temperature. optical densities of selected areas appearing on autoradiograms were determined using a video-computer enhancement program (jandel
video analysis software java) and it was in charge of transforming optical densities
into fmol/mg of protein. the standard optical densities were used to determine tissue radioactivity values for the accompanying tissue sections. results were obtained
from 8 untrained and autoshaping trained animals per group and from each brain
area, 10 optical density readings were taken from at least three slices and were
averaged. twenty-eight brain areas were analyzed and each brain area was identiﬁed according with [94] atlas. fig. 5 depicted total binding of sert in each brain
areas (see table 1). it should be noted that the readings were directly made on the
autoradiograms and imagines like those of fig. 5, which depicted representative
examples.
2.4.2.3. statistical analysis. the sert density was expressed as mean ± sem of
fmol/mg of protein, which was analyzed by a three-way anova. when results were
expressed as percentage of untrained animals these data were analyzed by a twoway anova. for all post-hoc analysis the tukey test was used and p < 0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant. however, more stringent statistical signiﬁcant
levels (i.e., p < 0.01 and p < 0.001) were used, which reduced the number of false
positives. likewise, as 25 brain areas were compared with 12 different conditions

3. results
3.1. experiment 1: autoshaping: ma dose–response curve
the percentage of cr scores of the saline control group during the autoshaping testing sessions (fig. 2) were 6 ± 1 (stm),
8 ± 1 and 13 ± 3 (both ltm). in contrast, meth (1–10 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly [f(3,42) = 7.16, and p < 0.001] decreased the cr%, and
tukey test revealed signiﬁcant effects at 1.0–10.0 mg/kg only
during stm and at 1.0 mg/kg during ltm (48 h) [f(3,41) = 3.26,
and p < 0.05]. no signiﬁcant effects were observed during ltm
(at 24 h). certainly the decrement was not dose-related. to
place into context these data, it should be noted that the freeoperant level of cr is around 0.6 ± 0.2 [36,91] or spontaneous
lever-pressing responses in naïve rats are almost zero [49].
the difference in cr number between the ﬁrst and subsequent
autoshaping sessions was modest but growing and clearly separated training from testing sessions. normally, once animals
show 2–3 or more cr, performance become stable and with-

during the choice phase (fig. 3), rats receiving saline signiﬁcantly [t(7) = 4.85, p < 0.01] spent more time exploring the novel
object indicating that this group remembered which of the object
had previously been exposed to. the ﬂuoxetine (10.0 mg/kg) group
spent more (not signiﬁcantly) time exploring the novel object
and, hence it had no effects. in contrast, administration of meth
(1.0 mg/kg) showed an amnesic-like effect by decreased recognition in nor task [t(7) = 3.15, p < 0.05] by reducing time exploring
of the novel object during stm; and ﬂuoxetine plus meth administration prevented this amnesic-like effect. the testing retention
at ltm (24 or 48 h) was not signiﬁcantly different even in the
control group [46]. the eq analysis (fig. 3) showed signiﬁcant differences among saline vs. meth, ﬂuoxetine and ﬂuoxetine plus
meth [f(3,27) = 18.36, p < 0.001]. tukey test revealed signiﬁcant
differences among control vs. ma-treated and ma vs. ﬂuoxetine plus meth groups. in short, ﬂuoxetine alone had no effect,
meth impaired stm and this effect was reversed by ﬂuoxetine.
3.3. experiment 3: autoshaping and autoradiography: ﬂuoxetine,
ma and ﬂuoxetine-ma
3.3.1. memory
anova revealed signiﬁcant [f(3,56) = 3.33, and p < 0.05] differences among control, ﬂuoxetine, meth and ﬂuoxetine plus meth
groups (fig. 4). tukey showed that ﬂuoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) had
not effect on either stm or ltm at 24 h; nevertheless, it signiﬁcantly increased cr% (26 ± 7%) relative to the control group
(12 ± 2%) during ltm (48 h). in contrast, meth (1.0 mg/kg) significantly decreased performance in stm (2 ± 1 of cr%) and ltm (at
48 h; 4 ± 1 of cr%) and these decrements were partially or completely reversed by ﬂuoxetine (fig. 2).

3.3.2. autoradiography
when autoradiograms of sert binding from all ﬁve groups
were compared, signiﬁcant differences were revealed by anova
among untrained and autoshaping trained groups [f(5,135) = 2876;
p < 0.001], and brain areas [f(27,135) = 1355; p < 0.001] (table 1,
figs. 5–10). thus, out of 28 brain areas analyzed, the autoshaping trained groups showed changes in all of them relative to the
untrained group. importantly, as table 1 shows, out of 336 comparisons submitted to tukey test and bonferroni correction, only 13
cases did not match. the discrepancies were observed in the visual
cortex and medial preoptic area (right hemisphere; table 2) of
untrained saline group; ventral septal nucleus (left hemisphere) of
untrained meth group; perirhinal cortex and medial preoptic area
(right hemisphere) of trained meth group; nucleus accumbens
and caudate putamen (left hemisphere) of trained meth; temporal associative cortex (right hemisphere) of ﬂuoxetine trained
group; restrosplenial dysgranular cortex and medial mammillary
nucleus (right hemisphere) of ﬂuoxetine plus meth trained group;
and, caudate putamen, intermediate septal nucleus and amyg-

dala basolateral (left hemisphere) of ﬂuoxetine plus meth trained
group. importantly, even between tukey test and bonferroni analysis (table 1), the differences were subtle. for instance, in the case
of the visual cortex (right hemisphere) of saline group, the former
assigned a p < 0.01 and the latter assigned p < 0.05. likewise, tukey
test showed signiﬁcant differences in the ventral septal nucleus
between untrained saline group vs. untrained meth animals and
trained saline vs. untrained meth animals; and bonferroni only
revealed differences in the former comparison. in the following
sections, results of speciﬁc brain areas are described.
3.3.2.1. cortical areas. the saline untrained group values of sert
binding were considered the basal or 100% level of sert binding
relative to the autoshaping trained animals. the two-way anova
comparing treatments and brain hemisphere revealed signiﬁcant differences in prefrontal [f(5,65) = 85, p < 0.001], cingulate
[f(5,66) = 57, p < 0.001], somatosensorial [f(5,71) = 105, p < 0.001],

hemisphere decreased sert binding ranging from 32% to 57%, being
the minor decrement in the entorhinal cortex (57%) while the major
suppression occurred in perirhinal and restrosplenial dysgranular
cortices (19%). concerning the left hemisphere of saline trained
group, sert binding decreased in most of the cortical areas, varying
between 32% and 58%; entorhinal cortex had the higher decrement
(58%) while perirhinal and restrosplenial dysgranular cortices
showed the minor decrement, 6% and 32%, respectively. the meth
untrained group relative to saline untrained animals showed
diminished sert binding in right and left hemispheres ranging
between 27–37% and 21–48%, respectively. in the right (58%) and
the left (62%) hemispheres entorhinal cortex presented the major
sert suppression. the minor suppression occurred in restrosplenial dysgranular (3%) and temporal (10%) cortices of the right
hemisphere and temporal (1%) and somatosensorial (13%) cortices
of the left hemisphere. in the case of meth trained group relative to
saline untrained animals the former showed the major sert decre-

ments ranging in the right and left hemispheres between 54–74%
and 52–78%, respectively. in the right hemisphere, the minor sert
decrement was observed in the restrosplenial dysgranular cortex
(35%) while the major suppression occurred in the entorhinal
cortex (74%). in contrast, at the left hemisphere the minor decrement occurred in the restrosplenial dysgranular (52%) and the
major decrement in the entorhinal cortex (78%). the ﬂuoxetine
trained group depicted increased sert binding in the right hemisphere ranging 25–70%, being the minor and major increments
observed in the restrosplenial granular (8%) and the restrosplenial
dysgranular (101%) cortices, respectively. in the left hemisphere
these increments ranged 24–74%, showing the minor and major
increments in the restrosplenial granular (3%) and the restrosplenial dysgranular (74%) cortices. finally, the ﬂuoxetine–meth
trained group showed increased sert binding, in the right and left
hemispheres ranging between 27–98% and 19–101%, respectively.
the minor increments occurred in the restrosplenial granular
(16%) cortex of the right hemisphere and temporal cortex (8%) of
the left hemisphere. for both hemispheres the higher increments
were observed in the restrosplenial dysgranular cortex (174%).

4. discussion
the present aim was to determine if pharmacological manipulation of sert affects memory and sert. as there was a robust
decrease in the sert binding throughout the brain, interestingly, a
number of relevant questions have suggested by referees. hence,
we focus on questions aiming to form a coherent whole by discussing the reliability of pharmacological changes on memory;
whether the changes on sert binding in various parts of the brain
can be attributed to memory formation; hemispherical domination,
speciﬁcity of pharmacological effects, extrapolation of results, possible mechanisms and implications for further investigation. we
tried to maintain at minimum the discussion.
4.1. reliability of pharmacological changes on memory
post-training administration of flx improved or meth impaired
memory on nor and autoshaping and as both tasks have completely different (see section 1) cognitive and behavioral demand,
then these common effects conﬁrmed the reliability of the meth
amnesic-like and ﬂuoxetine anti-amnesic effects. similar results
have been reported by us and others (see section 1), including martins de lima et al. [51] and schröder et al. [52], who used 90 min and
24 h, for testing stm and ltm. it might be argued that the 90 min
falls well into the time required for de-novo-protein synthesis
dependent ltm; notwithstanding, this possibility is excluded since
infusion of the protein synthesis inhibitor  xxxd183xxx  in the dorsal
ca1 region immediately or 180 min but not 360 min after training
impaired speciﬁcally ltm [22] or consolidation of long-term object
recognition memory without affecting stm or hippocampal functionality [52,53]. thus, these results allow the characterizing stm
and ltm not only in terms of time but also on their pharmacological and molecular basis [22]. although, amphetamines, including
meth, produce stereotypies and increased locomotor responses,
they are dose-dependent, occur within a few days following administration and are related to cumulative dose rather than dosing
schedule (see [54]); which contrasts with the present meth acute
low dose. additionally, the inﬂuence of non-speciﬁc effects such as
hyper- or hypo-activity induced by meth or flx, respectively, were
reduced by post-training drug administration (see e.g., [23,55,95]).
finally, conﬁrming the speciﬁc effects on memory of flx, it produced anti-amnesic effects only in nor stm, thus supporting the
notion of no ltm on this task. on autoshaping task, meth produced ltm deﬁcits, such as effects were reversed by flx, which
were accompanied by sert down- or up-regulation in several brain
areas.
4.2. autoshaping and brain areas
when untrained and autoshaping trained groups were compared a down-regulation of sert in decreasing order was observed:
amygdala basomedial < entorhinal cortex < hypothalamus (dorsal area) < ventral tegmental area < hippocampus (ca1, dentate
gyrus,ca3) < basal ganglia (nucleus accumbens, caudate putamen) < amygdala basolateral < septum < raphe nuclei. thus, memory in an autoshaping task requires brain areas mediating
declarative/explicit (e.g., hippocampal ca area and dentate gyrus)
and, in minor degree, non-declarative/implicit memory (e.g., caudate putamen) (figs. 5–12). this conclusion is consistent with
previous evidence [12,13,36,92], showing that p/i autoshaping
requires hippocampal protein/mrna synthesis and [3 s] methionine incorporation for ltm engaging (in decreasing order): temporal
cortex < amygdala < hippocampus < caudate nucleus. although, it
has been suggested [11] that autoshaping forms “habits” or implicit
memory (as opposite to water maze forming explicit memory);
nevertheless, notably, the transition from declarative (i.e., explicit)

23

to procedural (i.e., implicit) representations is observed following
extended training (see [43,56,57]) or under devaluation and degradation of the instrumental, action-outcome contingency (see [58]).
interestingly, on these models chronic (pre-training) ﬂuoxetinetreatment or sert genetic deletion impaired operant responding
in the pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer task [59]. mild chronic
unpredictable stress and mdma pretreatment impaired learning in
the morris water maze but not an enhanced depletion of hippocampal sert protein [60]. likewise, rats receiving chronic pre-training
administration of ﬂuoxetine (5.0 mg/kg) spent signiﬁcantly less
time exploring the object recognition task and took longer association (determined by measuring photo beam interruptions)
between the cs and us in the short-delay pavlovian-conditioning
task without affect memory on the hippocampal-dependent water
maze [61]. according to these authors both nor and autoshaping
tasks are hippocampal-independent. although this is consistent
with the evidence that ﬂuoxetine pre-training administration
impairs memory (see e.g., [21,24]), it is noteworthy that in the
short-delay pavlovian-conditioning task of 12 sessions, signiﬁcant differences between the control and flx-treated groups were
observed only during the sessions 3–5. all together these data
stress the interaction among brain areas, neurotransmitters systems, drugs, cognitive and behavioral demand of learning tasks
and extent of training. actually, in overtrained animals striatum
is more engaged and less hippocampus [36]. since we are trying to identify neural markers accompanying memory formation,
hence effects due to overtraining should be excluded (thus excluding “habit” memory) by using an incipient level of memory. an
important complication with well-learned instrumental responses
is neither protein synthesis dependent for long-term maintenance
[62], nor uses hippocampus, amygdala or temporal cortex [22]
and may be insensitive to drugs effects (see e.g., [63]). indeed,
autoshaping training increased  xxxd161xxx  in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex relative to untrained animals but on autoshaping
overtrained animals it decreased [12]. even, during the time-course
of autoshaped responses, memory is progressive and mrna  xxxg1108xxx  or 5-ht7 receptors expression is monotonically augmented
or declined in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and raphe nuclei,
respectively [92].  xxxg1119xxx  receptors seem no show changes over
time [43]. interestingly, rats over-expressing striatal  xxxg1119xxx  receptor showed impaired performance in a simple operant learning
task, but not in the hippocampus-dependent water maze task [64].
4.3. sert and memory
as already mentioned above autoshaping trained groups relative to untrained showed a robust down-regulation of sert in
number of brain areas; and this requirement is hierarchically organized engaging brain areas mediating explicit and, in minor degree,
implicit memory. the ﬁnding that in a non-drug-treated autoshaping trained animal the sert binding decreased in virtually all
regions sampled by about 50%, after training and testing completion has not been previously reported. post-training administration
of ssris like ﬂuoxetine, generally improve memory consolidation and/or reverse amnesia (for review see [21,24]). these data
strongly suggest a link between sert and memory. pharmacological evidence also shows this link; e.g., flx provides long-lasting
protection against mdma-induced loss of sert [65]; in contrast,
ﬂuoxetine chronic administration increases serotonergic innervation without increasing sert binding ([66–68]; but see [69]).
herein, single dose of ﬂuoxetine improved memory, increased
sert binding and protected against induced-amnesic and downregulated sert effects by meth. the present meth amnesic-like
effects are consistent with evidence, covering memory deﬁcits
ranging from nor deﬁcit in rats to working memory in humans
(see e.g., [4] and section 1). importantly, the anti-amnesic effects of

24

r. tellez et al. / behavioural brain research 212 (2010) 12–26

flx had been reported in a variety of conditions, including pharmacological models of amnesia (see [21]), even in the mild cognitive
impairment [70] and in memory deﬁcits associated with ad (see
[20] for review). certainly, if ssris like ﬂuoxetine facilitate memory or have anti-amnesic effects, which might be are attributable
to its antidepressant or pro-mnesic action is controversial; nevertheless, these present data strongly suggest a link between memory
and sert. although, reduced sert availability is a transient effect as
evidenced in ex-ecstasy users but not regarding to memory. indeed,
verbal memory shows no sign of improvement even after over 2.5
years of abstinence [71], suggesting that sert plays a critical role
during memory consolidation.
4.4. hemisphere dominance
herein treatments produced modest differences between hemispherical dominance (table 1). regardless areas, in general terms,
relative to untrained animals, in the saline trained (memory consolidation), meth untrained and meth trained (amnesic-like effect)
groups the right hemispherical dominance was similar. moreover,
in the groups showing up-regulation of sert binding (ﬂuoxetine
alone and ﬂuoxetine plus meth) the dominance was in basal ganglia, lateral septal nucleus, hippocampus, amygdale, raphe nuclei
and prefrontal, perirhinal, entorhinal cortices. this implicates that
ltm facilitation and anti-amnesic effects required the opposite
hemispherical dominance, which are in line with asymmetric
serotonergic modulation during memory [40], amnesia and drug
administration.
4.5. pharmacological speciﬁcity and extrapolation of effects
underlying the serotonergic link to flx, its afﬁnity (ki ) for
sert is higher (nm = 30.8) than that for net (nm = >1000 and
dat nm = 1000; [72]). certainly, meth has considerable effects
on dopamine release (see section 1), hence modiﬁcations over
the  xxxg2149xxx  and receptors could not be excluded.
nonetheless, 5-ht systems are sensitive to meth effects ([73], this
work), is most potent at net, while being 5- to 9-fold less potent
at dat, and 200- to 500-fold less potent at sert [74]. interestingly,
only the lower dose (1.0 mg/kg) of meth impaired ltm (48 h), at 5.0
and 10.0 mg/kg was completely ineffective. so is it better for drug
abuser’s memory to take higher and not lower doses of meth? certainly, extrapolating data from rats to human should be made with
caution, meanly because the metabolism (t1/2) of meth in rat is
70 min and in human 12 h [75]. notably, the present study used single dose administration, which contrast, with the memory deﬁcits
seen following meth repeated administration or at high neurotoxic
doses (see e.g., [4]). stressing the consistency of meth amnesic low
doses, it reduced accuracy of responding in a dose-dependent fashion in the repeated-acquisition procedure (0.1–3.0 mg/kg; [76]) and
in the y-maze test produced mnemonic deﬁcit [77]. nonetheless,
the possibility exists that memory and sert binding are not related,
since the effects of ﬂuoxetine and meth on sert might to appear to
be more of a pharmacological nature rather than related to memory. however, corroborating the importance of sert on memory,
sert knockout (−/−) rats with acute tryptophan depletion showed
impaired nor stm [29]. nevertheless, sert(−/−) mice did not differ
from sert(+/+) mice in the pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (pit)
test suggesting that transfer of conditioned responses is not altered
in sert(−/−) animals (for review see [78]). ltm in the elevated plus
maze, was slightly reduced in sert(−/−) mice while in sert(−/−) rats
showed memory impaired in the hidden platform in the morris
water maze test (see [78]). thus, these genetic results seem provide further support to the link sert and memory. herein, while
meth in untrained animals slightly reduced sert, during autoshaping it produced amnesia and reduced down-regulated sert binding

in diverse regions, including cortices (e.g., prefrontal and entorhinal), basal ganglia, hippocampus (e.g., dentate gyrus, ca1 and ca3
areas). notably, in human meth and mdma provoked cognitive
deﬁcits and reduced sert density [2,3] in the dorsolateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal cortex, and parietal cortices [1]. here, the
flx-memory facilitation or anti-amnesic effects were accompanied with sert increments in multiple regions. although untrained
rats treated with ﬂuoxetine were not tested, previous studies have
reported that the sert amount was increased [68]. thus, while
memory formation was accompanied by a moderate and selective
reduction sert binding, amnesia was accompanied by a wide and
extent sert reduction, suggesting that memory made sert more
liable to the meth effects. this suggests caution when extrapolating conclusions derived from ex vivo studies to those realized in
vitro and vice versa.
4.6. mechanisms for sert modiﬁcations
according with the present results it is unclear if sert directly
acts on memory formation; nevertheless, memory, amnesia and
drugs directly affected sert. additionally, the impaired memory
observed in some sert ko (−/−) animals and the sert decrement
in ad brains (see section 1) suggest an important link. serts are
responsible primarily to terminate 5-ht synaptic action [79,87]
and in this work not attempt was made to determine extracellular
5-ht concentrations. what are the flx or meth mechanisms by
affecting sert binding? one option is that the enhanced binding
of intracellular neurotransmitter (e.g., serotonin) followed by
reverse transport of neurotransmitter into the synapse, eventually
would, lead to the sert internalization and a decrease in substrate
uptake. other probable hypotheses include the number of active
sert inﬂuences the level of serotonin, and the changed level
of serotonergic transmission via [87] various 5-ht receptors
modiﬁes processes of memory, or the level of active sert adapts
to the level of 5-ht. indeed, the ﬂuoxetine-facilitatory effects are
reversed by selective 5-ht1a-1b , 5-ht2a-2c , 5-ht3,4,6,7 receptor
antagonists [21–23,27]. in addition, protein and/or mrna binding
of diverse 5-ht receptors accompanies memory consolidation
(see [12]). importantly, regulation of sert function can occur at
the level of transcription, translation or post-translational (see
[79,87–90]), affecting, e.g., the  xxxg259xxx  brain-derived  xxxg1614xxx  (bdnf), camp-responsive element binding protein
(creb)-mediated gene binding; which are fundamental in memory formation (see [80]). these same mechanisms are consistent
within the context of serotonin classical and volume transmission;
which may included a rapidly and transiently up-regulating the
activity [87] and/or number of sert transporter via 5-ht, camkii,
ptk, while down-regulation occurs with meth, mdma, pkc [81].
moreover, post-translational modiﬁcations play a major role in
these cognitive processes, including neurotransmitter release,
protein kinases, phosphatases, etc. [82–84,96].
4.7. neurobiological changes and memory
although the behavioral effects of 5-ht receptors have been
extensively studied (see [11,12] for recent reviews), few publications have explored its neurobiological changes on memory
processes. studies like the present are required to determine if
the present results are reliable, whether the changes are due to
altered kd or v-max values and the molecular mechanisms mediating the ﬂuoxetine and meth effects. equally important it will be
addressing the meth effects on dopamine and noradrenalin systems and transporters. behavioral and pharmacological controls
such as separate groups of drug-treated trained rats and for ltm
without confound of being tested for stm while the drugs were ‘on
board’.

to conclude, trained animals decreased sert binding relative to
untrained ones. untrained and trained animals treated with the
amnesic dose of meth decreased sert binding in several areas
including hippocampus and cortex, being in the latter group even
steeper. in contrast, ﬂuoxetine improved ltm (48 h) and increased
sert binding. fluoxetine prevented the meth amnesic-like effect
and re-established the sert binding. memory consolidation and
amnesia seemed to make sert more vulnerable to drugs effects.
