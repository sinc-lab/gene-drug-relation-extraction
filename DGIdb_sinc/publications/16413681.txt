summary  xxxd3322xxx  is a novel potentiator of chemotherapy which, when added to doxorubicin, achieved an
unexpected and very large survival advantage over doxorubicin alone in a randomized trial in advanced breast cancer.
this trial was unusual in that the early endpoints (response rate and median progression-free survival) were equivalent
in the two arms, despite the ultimate survival difference. these aspects, coupled with the absence of a coherent
molecular mechanism of action, and a pending confirmatory trial, have led oncologists to hold judgement on this drug.
this paper reacts to this in three ways: firstly, a forensic subgroup analysis is presented with an explanation as to why it
strongly supports the veracity of the survival difference; secondly a novel cellular explanation is provided for the
decoupling of the early and late (survival) endpoints; finally, a molecular mechanism of action is proposed, for the first
time, which reconciles the peculiarities of the trial with the laboratory data and background literature. this hypothesis
explains how  xxxd3322xxx  could meld two of the apparent strengths of the cancer cell (drug resistance pumps, and
hypoxia-adapted energetics) into a potent weapon of self-destruction.  xxxd3322xxx  is proposed to allow chemotherapy
(e.g. anthracycline or taxane) to additionally kill a small but critical population (clone) of aggressive, multi-drug
resistant cells, the benefits of which cannot be appreciated until a period of time (about 6â€“8 months) has elapsed.
these cells, present in women with more rapidly relapsing disease, very likely carry an energy-dependent extrusion
pump which is paradoxically activated by  xxxd3322xxx  plus the chemotherapy. the result is that, despite the
chemotherapyâ€™s remaining extracellular, the cell dies from reactive oxygen species leaking from the electron chain
transport in the abnormal mitochondria which characterize cancer. these mitochondria are activated in response to
the atp cost of this pump activation, in these predominantly glycolytic cells.

arm containing the investigational chemopotentiating agent  xxxd3322xxx , was demonstrated [1].
 xxxd3322xxx , when combined with doxorubicin chemotherapy, was associated with an increase in
median survival (fig. 1) from 15.6 months (doxorubicin alone) to 23.6 months (p < 0.03). at the time,
this magnitude of benefit was almost unprecedented, although it has since been seen with the
addition of trastuzumab to taxane chemotherapy
[2]. the trastuzumab result, however, is applicable
only to the minority (15â€“20%) of women with
strongly her-2 positive cancers, whereas the
ma. 19 population represented the generality of
women with incurable, advanced breast cancer.
furthermore, the initial trial leading to the approval and rapid uptake of trastuzumab [3] was
characterized by a smaller proportional survival
increase.
trastuzumab can claim to be a targeted therapy,
since it is a biological agent developed against a
specific molecular target (her-2), and clearly requires the presence of high levels of the target in
the tumours for efficacy. although the details of
its precise mechanism of action remain richly controversial [4â€“7], the identification of its molecular
target has been enough to facilitate the acceptance of trastuzumab as a clinical standard.
the same cannot, as yet, be said for  xxxd3322xxx .
the academic community has tended to withold
judgement on this drug, pending the results of a
second randomized trial in advanced breast cancer, which is now fully accrued; it tests the addition of  xxxd3322xxx  to cyclophosphamide and
 xxxd2008xxx  chemotherapy. results should be known
in 2006. since this is a pivotal trial conducted under

vincent
the auspices of an fda special protocol assessment, regulatory approval may possibly ensue if
the trial meets its goals. because full acceptance
of  xxxd3322xxx  into clinical practice may be facilitated by some understanding of its mechanism of
action (moa), i am proposing a novel molecular
explanation. although some molecular effects of
 xxxd3322xxx  are known and published (vide infra),
they do not unify the clinical and in vitro data.
my proposal is based on conjecture which attempts
to link and reconcile some of the known facts in the
literature with the results of ma. 19 (in some ways
anomalous) and the discoveries emanating from a
forensic subgroup analysis of ma. 19 conducted by
myself [8].

background
history
 xxxd3322xxx  was discovered and developed by the
bristol-myers company in 1957 [9]. it was originally
designed as an anti-histamine, although never fully
developed for that purpose [10]. in the 1980s,
brandes et al. explored the hypothesis that intracellular histamine receptors might influence the
fate of cells, and tested intracellular histamine
blocking compounds (including  xxxd3322xxx ), as
modulators of chemotherapy in cancer [11].
 xxxd3322xxx  was found to potentiate a wide
range of cytotoxics and even to offer some protection of normal cells. however, the pattern of cellular and cytotoxic potentiation was very specific to

the cell line and cytotoxic employed [11â€“14]; the
reasons for this were unknown.

published information referring to
mechanism
it was appreciated that  xxxd3322xxx  resembled the
anti-estrogen tamoxifen, structurally. although
not a ligand for the classical  xxxg730xxx 
(er),  xxxd3322xxx  does bind to the â€˜â€˜anti estrogen
binding siteâ€™â€™, or aebs [15â€“17]. this site is thought
to be one locus for intracellular histamine binding,
and is also closely associated physically with the
cytochrome p450 system (especially the isoform
cyp3a4). other work by brandes confirmed that
 xxxd3322xxx  did interact with cyp2d6,  xxxg575xxx  and
cyp3a4, and was able to partially inhibit the latter,
at clinically achievable levels [18]. this raised the
possibility of that pharmacokinetic effects might
ensue, or that  xxxd3322xxx  might delay the intracellular degradation of certain chemotherapies.
furthermore, at certain concentrations,  xxxd3322xxx  was found to be both a substrate and an
inhibitor of the p-glycoprotein (p-gp) pump responsible for the multi-drug resistant cancer cell phenotype [19]. therefore, at least part of the action of
 xxxd3322xxx  was thought to be mediated by p-gp
inhibition [12]. this could occur at the level of
the cancer cell and/or via pharmacokinetic mechanisms since p-gp is known to influence clearance of
anthracycline chemotherapies [20â€“24].
another moa involving prostaglandins has been
postulated by brandes, who was primarily responsible for discovering the anticancer utility of  xxxd3322xxx  and guiding its early development. in
particular,  xxxd3322xxx  may modulate the effects
of 12(s)hete in cancer cells, and indirectly, influence the susceptibility of cellular dna to chemotherapy [11].
work in france has shown, furthermore, that
 xxxd3322xxx  can inhibit cholesterol synthetic enzymes, particularly d8d71 and  xxxg630xxx , an effect
linked to the aebs binding [25]. one consequence
of this is an abnormal accumulation of sterols in
the cancer cell. the consequences of this are
unknown.
in an attempt to clarify the pattern of potentiation, our laboratory conducted a series of in vitro
tests with doxorubicin,  xxxd2008xxx , and docetaxel
at  xxxd3322xxx  concentrations resembling those
clinically achievable [26]. we confirmed that doxorubicin,  xxxd2008xxx  and docetaxel were all potentiated in the p-gp+, mdr+ head and neck cancer cell
line hn-5a/v15e but not the p-pg negative, mdr
negative parent cell line hn-5a (figs. 2a and 2b).

figure 2a potentiation by  xxxd3322xxx  of the effect of
docetaxel against mdr positive hn-5a/v15e cells.

figure 2b no effect of  xxxd3322xxx  on cytotoxicity of
docetaxel against mdr negative hn-5a cells.

no potentiation was seen in the p-gp- lines mdamb-435, mcf-7, lncap, du145, a549, h520 and
hn va, except for sporadic very minor effects. this
was consistent with the earlier analysis which suggested that potentiation of the effects of p-gp substrate anthracycline and taxane chemotherapy
might only occur in p-gp positive cell lines [12,27].
yet normal cells, in vivo, including these which
also express p-gp, do not seem to be preferentially
killed by chemotherapy in the presence of  xxxd3322xxx , and may (in the case of gastrointestinal cells)
even be protected by  xxxd3322xxx .
protection has been shown in a rat ulcer model
[28] and was also suggested in the ma. 19 result in
which the incidence of certain gastrointestinal toxicities was reduced, i.e. oral mucositis (by a third)
and diarrhea (reduced by a half), in the  xxxd3322xxx 
arm [1]. powerful protection of whole animals has
been demonstrated for  xxxd2134xxx  [11].

clinical trial experience
 xxxd3322xxx  was investigated in a phase i clinical
trial in cancer [27,29] which revealed that doselimiting toxicity consisted of manageable, infusion

718
rate-dependent, cns side effects including transient ataxia,  xxxd1892xxx  and hallucinations
(predominantly hyperacusis). at the recommended
phase ii dose of 5.3 mg/kg a number of single arm
studies were carried out, mainly in advanced
breast cancer, and mostly with natural product
type cytotoxics including doxorubicin,  xxxd2008xxx ,
paclitaxel and docetaxel. these studies suggested
a superior response rate and survival at the upper
end of expectations [30â€“32].
a single arm prostate cancer study was also
done, with cyclophosphamide, and also showed
an apparently superior response, as measured by
psa and pain control [33]. another phase ii study
in prostate cancer (with mitoxantrone/prednisone), showed a very favorable pain and psa response compared to historical controls [34,35].
at the recommended phase ii dose, pharmacokinetic studies revealed a cmax of 3â€“5 lmol/l and an
elimination half-life of 11 Â± 2 h [27]. the cmax is
important because it indicates a threshold concentration beyond which in vitro effects may not be
relevant to the clinical moa.

the ma. 19 results: surprises and anomalies
the successful phase ii program culminated in the
multicentre, international randomized ma. 19 trial,
conducted by the national cancer institute of canada and sponsored by bristol myers. although the
ma. 19 was significantly positive for survival, the
primary endpoint, response rate, was virtually
identical in the two arms (table 1). this was the
case at the interim analysis, and remained so
throughout. (as a result, the trial was prematurely
halted but by then 305 of the planned 350 had been
treated). median progression-free survival (pfs)

was also identical but did show a peculiar latebreaking difference favoring the  xxxd3322xxx  arm
in the second half of the graph (fig. 3).
these anomalies have also contributed to the
skepticism surrounding the outcome of ma. 19,
since at the time these results became known
(2001) there were few clear examples of randomized trials in cancer, in which the response and survival were decoupled in favor of the latter. one
known example was a comparison of paclitaxel
and cmf chemotherapy, in advanced breast cancer
[36]. however, since then, this phenomenon has
been seen with  xxxd2029xxx  in pancreatic cancer [37].

forensic analysis of ma. 19
in order to evaluate the survival benefit, i undertook
a forensic analysis of ma. 19, including subgroup
analyses that were not pre-defined. published
briefly elsewhere [8], this analysis supported the
veracity of the survival result, based on the sheer
magnitude of the effect, the absence of differences
in p2nd line therapies, the absence of sufficient

figure 3 progression-free survival in ncic ma. 19 trial: no statistical difference between doxorubicin with
 xxxd3322xxx  (median 5.9 months) and doxorubicn alone (median 6.0 months): hazard radio 0.85.

difference in baseline prognostic factors and the
emergence of several patterns of benefit/lack of
benefit which had little probability of arising by
chance. these included:
(1) the vast predominance of  xxxd3322xxx -induced
survival benefit in er negative patients, compared with the much smaller and later effect
in er positive patients (figs. 4a and 4b).
(2) the complete absence of benefit in those onethird of patients with the most indolent cancers, as demonstrated by a relapse time >36
months from surgery for the original primary
breast cancer; correspondingly, the survival of
those patients with relapse time 636 months
was enormous (figs. 5a and 5b); 12.2 months
median vs. 29.7 months (consequently, the current pivotal trial only includes those patients
who relapse within 36 months).
(3) the limitation of the survival benefit to whose
who responded to chemotherapy; those
patients whose tumors were a priori drug resistant exhibited no additional benefit from
 xxxd3322xxx  (figs. 6a and 6b).
these patterns, together with the sheer magnitude of the survival difference, strongly suggested
that some mechanism, and not just chance, was
likely to have accounted for the survival benefit.
in fact, patients relapsing within 36 months, when
treated with doxorubicin/ xxxd3322xxx , acquire a
statistically indistinguishable survival from the
more indolent patients relapsing after 36 months,
treated without  xxxd3322xxx , (fig. 7). the same

719

phenomenon is seen with er negative patients on
the combination improving their survival so that
their survival comes to resemble closely the more
indolent er positive patients on doxorubicin alone
(fig. 8). these improvements suggest that  xxxd3322xxx  is a treatment that converts aggressive cancers
into indolent cancers, again implying the function
of some mechanism.
although the operation of any mechanism
strongly supports the notion that the ma. 19 survival
result was a true rather than a false positive, it is
still the case that both the cellular and the molecular mechanisms underlying these patterns of benefit demand explanation. i suggest that the results
are largely explicable if the beneficiaries of  xxxd3322xxx  were only that subset of patients whose tumours contained a small number of distinctly
aggressive cells, which although initially present
as a minority population, would eventually â€˜â€˜grow
outâ€™â€™ as an expanding clone [38], if given enough
time, and start to drive events (i.e. patient death).
these cells, i suggest, are materially present only in
those patients with the more rapidly relapsing cancers, but even then, initially constitute only a
minority of cells. their elimination would not influence the objective response rate, because in order
to be declared a â€˜â€˜responderâ€™â€™ (complete or partial
in ma. 19), a p50% reduction in cross-sectional area
was required, which corresponds to a volume
reduction of at least two-thirds of the tumour.
given the unavoidable inaccuracies in response
assessment, it is readily apparent that a small number of additional cells eliminated would not be
immediately registrable. this is probably why the

about half the patients.

about half the patients.

 xxxd3322xxx  (median 19.8 months) vs. doxorubicin alone (median 28.6 months): p value not significant.

response rate was the same in the two arms of
ma. 19.
it can also explain why the first half of the progression-free survival is identical in the two arms
but the second half of the graph breaks out with
a benefit for  xxxd3322xxx ; this late benefit is apparent because time is required for the elimination of
an initially small but aggressive clone to yield overt
benefits. survival, of course, is also a late benefit.
strikingly, the sub-population occupying the first

half of the pfs curve for ma. 19 exhibits a large survival benefit for  xxxd3322xxx , as does the sub-population occupying the second half. this is a clear
illustration that the determinants of response and
pfs are not necessarily the same as the determinants of survival. the explanation for this
discrepancy in ma. 19 is clonal heterogeneity, a
phenomenon well known to be characteristic of
cancer [39]. furthermore, this trial cautions
against the philosophy that late signals do not

occur in the absence of early signals in randomized
trials in cancer.
the identity of this small number of critically
important cells is a key element in linking this
ma. 19 result to the available laboratory data (vide
infra).

a critique of some possible molecular
explanations
a pharmacokinetic explanation, i.e. that  xxxd3322xxx  increased the blood levels of doxorubicin, is

highly unlikely since doxorubicin-specific side effects were not enhanced, and since the clear lack
of benefit in patients with indolent, slower growing
cancers could not be explained like this. furthermore, pharmacokinetic explanations cannot explain the in vitro potentiation patterns.
since in ma. 19,  xxxd3322xxx  was not associated
with a significant increase in anthracycline cardiotoxicity, it is presumably not a mimic of trastuzumab (herceptin) which does potentiate
anthracycline cardiotoxicity and which is generally
not given with doxorubicin for that reason.

28.6 months) vs. patients relapsing <36 months after surgery on doxorubicin plus  xxxd3322xxx  (median 29.7 months):
p = 0.8712.

since the added survival benefit was seen much
more in er negative than er positive patients, it
cannot work like a classical anti-estrogen (e.g.
tamoxifen), and since  xxxd3322xxx  does not bind
er, it cannot even be argued that the er in er positive tumors is sequestrating  xxxd3322xxx  away
from its active site. furthermore, tamoxifen is
known to antagonize the effects of anthracycline
chemotherapy in clinical studies [40], and although
er positive tumours did not benefit much from
 xxxd3322xxx  added to doxorubicin in ma. 19, they

did benefit to some degree, and there is certainly
no evidence of antagonism. also tamoxifen increased gastrointestinal toxicity (diarrhea) in dogs
when co-administered with doxorubicin [41] in contrast to the reduction in diarrhea from  xxxd3322xxx 
in ma. 19.
since its benefit is confined to those patients
who tumors are sensitive at least to some degree
to doxorubicin, it is presumably working as a
chemopotentiator, and not as a single agent (which
is also consistent with the laboratory data [26],

showing  xxxd3322xxx  is inactive as a single agent a
clinically relevant concentrations. however, it is
only necessary that chemopotentiation be confined
to an initially small but important subgroup of
cells, for a survival benefit to manifest.
the then licensee, bms inc., conducted a series
of investigations which focused substantially on the
ability of  xxxd3322xxx  to reverse the multi-drug
resistance (mdr) phenotype. membrane extrusion
pumps, especially p-gp are largely responsible for
this phenomenon, characterized by exclusion of
chemotherapy from the cell interior. these studies
revealed that, at levels higher (Â±40-fold higher, i.e.
190 lm) than can be achieved clinically,  xxxd3322xxx  appeared to behave as a modestly effective
p-gp inhibitor, depleted atp and collapsed the
mitochondrial potential. the potentiating effect
of  xxxd3322xxx  seemed to be most convincing for
the p-gp substrate drugs doxorubicin and paclitaxel, but only in a known p-gp over-expressing cell
line; potentiation did not occur in the p-gp negative parent line, hct116.
furthermore, at 19 lm, (4-fold over clinical
cmax) intracellular paclitaxel levels only achieved
14% of levels in the parent line, and at 190 lm,
50%. the unrealistically high concentrations required to reverse p-gp suggest strongly that p-gp
inhibition is not a clinically relevant moa. however,
this study did confirm that  xxxd3322xxx  was a substrate for p-gp, on the basis of photo-labeling;
 xxxd3322xxx  was however, 10-fold less potent than
paclitaxel in diminishing the photo-labeling of 3hazidopine [19].
another study [27] in the cem/vlb 1000
(mdr+) cell line, indicated that even at a con-

centration of 20 lm,  xxxd3322xxx  did not result
in significant intracellular ingress of  xxxd1816xxx 
(unlike with verapamil) yet, these authors clearly
showed chemopotentiation of  xxxd1816xxx  at
 xxxd3322xxx  concentrations of 3.5 lm. this study,
therefore, also indicates that  xxxd3322xxx  does
not work in vivo as a p-gp inhibitor, despite its
selectivity for mdr+ cells. since there is no existing explanation for mdr reversal other than p-gp
inhibition, these results are striking and
provocative.
this data, although compelling, does not exclude a small quantity of cytotoxic ingress,
although the relevance of this is doubtful; nonetheless at 19 lm, the bms work did show that 14% of
hct116 levels of paclitaxel was allowed into the
hct116 mdr+ cells. possibly an even smaller
amount would get in at 3â€“5 lm  xxxd3322xxx , and
the importance of this small ingress of cytotoxic
is doubtful.
 xxxd3322xxx  has been found to partially inhibit
 xxxg590xxx  [42]. although cyp 3a4 is
the only endogenous metabolic route for the disposal of docetaxel, it is much less important in paclitaxel metabolism and not important for clearance
of the anthracyclines [43]; therefore anthracycline
potentiation is not mediated this way and since
taxane and anthracycline potentiation patterns
tend to track together, cyp 3a4 inhibition is unlikely to represent the major moa, at least in mdr+
cells. this is despite the fact that p-gp and cyp
3a4 are frequently upregulated together [44] and
share some substrates commonalities [45]. furthermore, if  xxxd3322xxx  itself does not actually
get into the mdr+ cells (since it is a substrate for

724
p-gp), any intracellular effects found in other cells
may be irrelevant to potentiation in mdr+ cells.
the laboratory work strongly speaks to some
aspect of the mdr phenotype as conferring susceptibility to  xxxd3322xxx  potentiation. traditionally,
multi-drug resistance reversal has involved inhibition
of one or more of the â€˜â€˜atp binding casetteâ€™â€™ (abc)
pumps (like p-gp), yet this approach has not achieved
clinical success, despite strenuous efforts [46] with
numerous candidate molecules [47]. if  xxxd3322xxx 
works only by reversal of the mdr state, but not by
actual inhibition of the p-gp pump, how does it work?
is p-gp the target, or just a marker for the presence
of the target somewhere else in the mdr+ cell? and is
the potentiated killing in mdr+ cells best understood
as â€˜â€˜reversalâ€™â€™ of the mdr state?

the hypothesis
i would suggest that all the following 4 elements
are at least necessary for effective potentiation
of cell killing by  xxxd3322xxx , with respect to vinca
alkaloids, anthracyclines and taxanes:
(1) a mdr+ in fact, perhaps p-gp+ cell (an alternative pump, like brcp or mrp could suffice;
some atp-consuming pump is required);
(2) the concurrent presence of the chemotherapy;
(3) the presence of  xxxd3322xxx ;
(4) warburg-type metabolism in which cancer cells
aberrantly over-utilize glycolysis and under-utilize their mitochondria for oxidative phosphorylation, despite adequate oxygen [48â€“50].
i postulate that the minority clone during the
ma. 19 results were in fact mdr positive, perhaps
p-gp or mrp positive cells, based on the associations amongst p-gp, mrp, lymph node status,
receptor status, mitotic activity, high grade drug
resistance, relapse free survival and poor outcome
[51â€“57]. although these associations are inconsistent, perhaps due to the documented variations
in assay systems for multi-drug resistance proteins
[58], there is an overall impression that the mdr
phenotype is associated with aggressivity. however, it remains unclear whether mdr is a prognostic or predictive factor, or both. this type of cell,
unless removed, would increase (not decrease) under the influence of doxorubicin chemotherapy and
given enough time, come to constitute much of the
tumour and eventually drive late clinical events as
described above in ma. 19.
far from being a p-gp inhibitor, i envisage  xxxd3322xxx  to be an activating p-gp substrate, which

vincent

enables the p-gp pump to extrude typical p-gp substrates (such as anthracyclines or taxanes) more
efficiently. this process consumes atp, since the
p-gp is absolutely, and highly dependent on atp
hydrolysis [59]. the mechanism of cell death is
likely to result not from the presence of chemotherapy inside the cell (in fact the chemotherapy
is extruded) but, directly or indirectly, from the
enhanced consumption of atp. the atp may be
consumed below a threshold necessary for survival,
or, (more likely) the enhanced atp production required to maintain atp levels may result in the
generation of reactive oxygen species (ros) to an
extent that overwhelms the cellâ€™s ability to inactivate them. the result would be additional cell
death, but only in the mdr+ population. the doxorubicin would continue to act on the drug sensitive
remainder of the cell population, but without the
help of  xxxd3322xxx .
this conjecture, which postulates an entirely
novel mechanism of action, is based on the
following:
(i)  xxxd3322xxx  has a chemical structure (fig. 9)
which strongly suggests it interacts with the
p-gp, containing as it does two linked phenyl
rings, a tertiary amine, and a carbonyl
group. ramu and ramu [60] reviewed >100
compounds and determined the important
structural characteristics of p-gp inhibitors
to include tertiary amines, phenyl rings and
a carbonyl group. although i am not proposing p-gp inhibition,  xxxd3322xxx  is a p-gp
inhibitor at unachievably high concentrations; to the point, its chemistry implies it
has the correct structure to at least interact
with p-gp, as confirmed in the labeling
experiments [12].
(ii) the phenomenon of a p-gp activation transforming into a p-gp inhibitor at higher doses
has a precedent in verapamil, which is a p-gp
activator  xxxd1891xxx  lm and a p-gp inhibitor at
50 lm [61]. substances acting like this are
known as â€˜â€˜class iâ€™â€™ compounds.

 xxxd3322xxx  may enhance breast cancer chemotherapy
(iii) crucially, karwatsky et al. [61] elegantly and
convincingly show that not only is low dose
verapamil a p-gp activator, it can even kill
high p-gp expressing cells by itself as a direct
results of p-gp atpase activation, via generation of reactive oxygen species (ros), and
atp depletion. this phenomenon is known
as â€˜â€˜verapamil hypersensitivityâ€™â€™, has been
shown by several other authors as well
[62â€“66]. i am proposing that  xxxd3322xxx 
potentiation of chemotherapy is a variant
of this phenomenon, different only in that,
unlike with verapamil, the chemotherapy is
also required, to further deplete atp, acting
also, and only on the membrane pump, not
internally.
(iv) low dose verapamil occupies a site in the
common drug-binding pocket in the transmembrane domain of p-gp. this alters, at
long range, the conformation of the p-gp
such that the nucleotide binding domain
(nbd) of the p-gp becomes more efficient
at atp hydrolysis since the â€˜â€˜walker aâ€™â€™ consensus site for nucleotide (i.e. atp) binding
in one nbd is brought closer to the â€˜â€˜lsggqâ€™â€™
signature sequence in the other nbd [67].
(v) it is possible to modify rhodamine or verapamil chemically, i.e. methane-thiosulfonaterhodamine (mts-rhodamine or mts-verapamil) so that they bind covalently in the common drug binding pocket of, and
â€˜â€˜permanentlyâ€™â€™ activate, the pump, even
in the absence of transport [67]. these
authors show that the pump is still able to
bind and extrude rhodamine since the binding site for rhodamine (and colchicine)
appears distinct from the binding site for
the verapamil. the joint requirement for
 xxxd3322xxx  and chemotherapy implies that
the same sort of relationship might apply,
resulting in further â€˜â€˜revvingâ€™â€™ of the pump
by the addition of chemotherapy to
 xxxd3322xxx .
(vi) the peculiar finding of  xxxd1816xxx â€™s
remaining outside the cell despite effective
potentiation of cell killing by  xxxd3322xxx 
[27], which can only indicate that the actual
proximate killing mechanisms is very unlikely
to directly involve intracellular chemotherapy, and that the p-gp pump (or one of the
pump family) is actively extruding the chemotherapy, and is by no means inhibited.
(vii) a similar phenomenon of potentiation confined to a p-gp over-expressing mdr+ but
not mdr cell line was seen with  xxxd3484xxx , also an activator of the p-gp pump and

725
its atpase activity [68]. also, the doxorubicin chemotherapy in this study remained
outside the cell, despite efficient potentiation, the explanation for which was unknown
at the time [69].
(viii) since  xxxd3322xxx  does not potentiate cytotoxicity in normal cells, even if (as in the
gut) p-gp+, and in fact may protect the gut
through p-gp activation, there must be a
resilience in normal cells which is absent in
p-gp+ cancer cells. i am postulating that
the source of this resilience is in fact the
intact atp-producing apparatus, including
normally functioning mitochondria which
can generate plenty of atp. by contrast,
the extra-ordinary energy economy of the
cancer cell, discovered by nobel laureate
otto warburg in 1929 [49,50], is, i believe,
what makes cancer cells uniquely susceptible to this mode of killing.

the warburg effect is the basis for pet scanning,
in which the enhanced intracellular glucose transport in most (or all?) cancer cells is exploited for
imaging with radio-labeled glucose. as a consequence, warburgâ€™s original insight is at last receiving the serious attention it deserves [48,70â€“75],
and is now widely accepted as at least partially true.
warburgâ€™s original statement, that the cancer
cellsâ€™ mitochondria do not contribute at all to
atp generation, and that the cancer cell relies
exclusively on glycolysis whether hypoxic or normoxic, is almost certainly an overstatement. however, the contribution to atp from mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation is now accepted to be
somewhat reduced from normal, perhaps because
intermediary metabolites need to flow down the
hexose monophosphate shunt to generate ribose
for dna synthesis, or because the mitochondria
are co-opted for other purposes (e.g. lipid production) and because mitochondrial membrane alterations in the electron transport chain result from
whatever occurs to frustrate the apoptosis signaling pathway (in which the mitochondrial membrane
is a control point). for instance, activation of the
oncogene ras has been shown to â€˜â€˜lockâ€™â€™ the mitochondria into a non-phosphorylating mode, liable
to generate ros [76]. normal cells are capable of
warburg-type metabolism, e.g. when monocytes
proliferate under an antigenic stimulus; perhaps
it is an alternate mode that all cells can adopt
when undergoing rapid clonal expansion [77,78].
this mode would enable them to survive temporary
hypoxia, make dna for proliferation and avoid
apoptosis, when physiologically required to do so,
as in the early fetus, for example.

726
warburg-type metabolism has recently been
confirmed in both breast cancer cell lines [75]
and, strikingly, in 97% of human breast carcinoma
samples [79]. cancer cells generally had marked
up-regulation of glycolytic enzymes and down-regulation of mitochondrial b-f1-atpase. remarkably,
metabolic markers indicative of energetics could
also identify a bad prognostic subgroup; paradoxically, those that had the shortest disease-free or
overall survival had higher (i.e. less abnormal) levels of mitochondrial b-f1-atpase, as if these (obviously aggressive) cells were driving their
mitochondria to produce as much atp as possible,
given that glycolysis is only capable of limited
atp generation. this is exactly the situation in
which ros production would rise; it is entirely consistent with both my moa hypothesis and the ma. 19
subgroup data that these cells would be the best
candidates for  xxxd3322xxx  potentiation.
it is reasonable to conjecture that, under conditions of severe atp demand, the cancer cell may
try to call on these otherwise co-opted mitochondria to upregulate oxidative phosphorylation, when
they are switched to this â€˜â€˜otherâ€™â€™ mode; under
such circumstances, high levels of ros can be generated because the electron transport chain is not
configured appropriately [70,80]. the same effect
may result if the cancer cell mitochondria are functionally impeded because of mitochondrial dna
damage, for which mounting evidence exists in
cancer cells [81,82]. whatever the exact role of
the warburg effect in carcinogenesis, there is
abundant evidence that â€˜â€˜cancer cells are under increased intrinsic ros stressâ€™â€™ [80] and that mitochondria are the major source of cellular ros,
including in cancer cells. the origin of ros in cancer cells may relate to oncogenic signals like c-myc
and ras; malfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, perhaps due to mitochondrial mutations
or co-option, either way leading to enhanced â€˜leakageâ€™ of electrons from the respiratory complex;
and finally, the increased demands for energy associated with the malignant state, especially the increased energy requirements of drug resistant
variants. the p-gp pump for example, is a substantial and obligate user of atp, even in the so-called
â€˜resting stateâ€™ [59].
the effects of excessive ros generation, which
are well known to include dna damage in both nucleus and mitochondria, (further amplifying the
problem) are both necrotic and apoptotic cell
death [80]. in normal cells the ability to meet the
extra atp demand would be intact since mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is intact, the cells
are well oxygenated, and therefore not only do
these normal cells not die, they may actually be

vincent
protected since the pump in these cells could
also be activated by  xxxd3322xxx . consequently,
normal cells would not experience excessive ros
generation.
which of the mdr+ or the glycolytic phenotype in
cancer cells is more contributory to  xxxd3322xxx 
potentiation, or whether both are equally required
and necessary, is unknown; however both are associated with aggressivity. the ros problem ought to
be most severe in the most highly active cells, the
rapidly growing (i.e. aggressive) cells with atpdepleting drug resistance pumps either constitutively active, or inducible. it is indeed only in these
cells that  xxxd3322xxx  potentiation occurs with p-gp
substrates.

weaknesses
this hypothesis does not attempt to account for
the sporadic potentiation of selected, non-mdr+
cancer cells to a variety of other, non-p-gp substrate chemotherapies such as cyclophosphamide,
cisplatin and  xxxd2134xxx  [11,13,15,19,27,83,84]. in these
cases, p-gp is presumably absent and  xxxd3322xxx 
could gain access to the cellâ€™s interior. the mechanism of potentiation in these cases could be substantially different. the extent to which
resistance mechanisms to these other chemotherapies are energy-dependent and whether  xxxd3322xxx  could increase energy consumption in these
situations, (perhaps via alternative pump activation) is unknown. this may, however, represent
a unifying explanation, across all these examples,
especially if protection of normal cells could be
shown to derive from activation of these resistance mechanisms. there is no doubt that the protective effect in normal cells is very significant in
the laboratory, at least, and also requires explanation. p-gp activation would likely not protect cells
from non-p-gp substrates like  xxxd2134xxx  [11], but a generalized enhancement of a broad range of pumps
could provide protection against a range of nonp-gp substrates like  xxxd2134xxx  and cisplatin [85â€“92]
while at the same time providing a means of cancer cell killing via atp consumption/ros generation, as with p-gp substrates and p-gp.there is
some evidence that normal cells (but not cancer
cells) can be transiently taken out of cycling by
 xxxd3322xxx , which may also be protective; however, in the ma. 19 trial, this phenomenon did
not translate into more chemotherapy being able
to be given (due to protection of normal tissues)
as the explanation for the survival benefit; the
delivery of doxorubicin to each arm was very
similar.

 xxxd3322xxx  may enhance breast cancer chemotherapy
my hypothesis can only offer some tentative
explanations for the apparent lack of effect in
ma. 19, of  xxxd3322xxx , in patients who were initially drug resistant to doxorubicin (fig. 6b). in
some of these patients, the absence of any doxorubicin benefit may not be due to solely or mainly
to mdr. it is also possible that in these patients,
longer exposures to  xxxd3322xxx  and chemotherapy
might have been required; this phenomenon has
been documented in an early trial of  xxxd3322xxx 
[27]. finally, since part of the cytotoxic mechanism
of anthracyclines involves ros generation [93] it is
just possible that de novo resistance to anthracyclines identifies patients with tumours whose ros
defense mechanisms are replete and difficult to
exhaust. alternatively, these â€˜pdâ€™ patients might
have been relatively refractory to apoptosis by
ros generation as is known to be the case with
bcl-2â€º [61]. the point here is that the mechanism
of susceptibility/lack of it to  xxxd3322xxx  will be a
diagnostic clue as to the original mechanism of
resistance to doxorubicin. according to the hypersensitivity theory, this could be due to increased
redox capacity, or raised levels of bcl-2.
this hypothesis is also agnostic as to the role, if
any, of small quantities of chemotherapy which
might gain access to the cell interior, as a result
of very low-level p-gp inhibition. anthracycline
and taxanes are known to generate ros and any
intracellular chemotherapy could only add to the
ros stress, and could further potentiate killing.
an alternative way to look at this is to conjecture
that the mechanism which i describe in this paper
(p-gp activation, ros generation and perhaps atp
depletion) may sensitize cells to small amounts of
intracellular chemotherapy. however, even if
these conjectural low levels of intracellular chemotherapy are necessary to administer the coup
de grace, they are obviously not sufficient in the
absence of the sensitivity mechanism i am
proposing.
additionally, it must be acknowledged that mdr
expression levels in primary breast cancer are not
uniformly associated with early relapse. however,
mdr is usually associated with other features prognostic of earlier relapse [94] and at least two papers including a very recent publication using
quantitative real time rt-pcr [95], do associate
mdr expression with a shorter disease-free interval
between surgery and appearance of metastases.
this would be consistent with the striking ma. 19
results in which the potentiation effect of  xxxd3322xxx  was absolutely confined to the two-thirds of
the population with relapse within 36 months of
their original breast surgery. it should also be
remembered that the required type of energy

727

metabolism may also contribute to the definition
of the sub-population of beneficiaries.
finally, other mechanisms are possible, as alternatives or in addition, e.g. involving ph regulation
or intracellular disposition of chemotherapy [96].
pure atp depletion is also possible, as is the generation of apoptotic â€˜second messengersâ€™ from the
mdr+ cell membrane. furthermore the intracellular antihistamine mechanism is not excluded.

predictions
this hypothesis, if true, would result in the following testable consequences, among others:
(i) potentiation of cell killing would occur
with pump substrate chemotherapies
remaining (largely) outside the potentiated
cell, i.e. doxorubicin,  xxxd2008xxx , and
docetaxel (in addition to the situations
with  xxxd1816xxx  and paclitaxel already
documented).
(ii) in mdr+ cells,  xxxd3322xxx  by itself ought to
generate some atp depletion and increased
ros generation consequent on an attempt
to compensate by enhancing atp production, and this effect (at least the ros effect)
should be further enhanced by the coadministration of p-gp substrate-type chemotherapy.
(iii) the degree of potentiation ought to parallel
the level of expression, or activity, of the pgp, or of other similar pumps, and which
could be experimentally manipulated.
(iv) it ought to be possible to show, in an isolated
membrane system, that  xxxd3322xxx  is a substrate activator of p-gp, and that doses of
 xxxd3322xxx  which potentiate the most
should correlate with dose levels which maximally activate the pump(s).
(v) the degree of potentiation ought to increase
in proportion with the concentrations of p-gp
substrate cytotoxics.
(vi) downregulation, or inhibition, of the most
responsible pump (e.g. p-gp) ought to diminish or abrogate potentiation. in particular,
inhibitors of p-gp atpase (e.g.  xxxd3488xxx , ivermectin) ought to prevent the  xxxd3322xxx 
effect.
(vii) transfection of an active pump into an mdr
negative cell line ought to enable or enhance
potentiation.
(viii) potentiation ought to be most readily seen in
cells in which glycolysis is already activated
to a maximum, perhaps as a result of

728

vincent
hypoxia, and in which the only additional
source of atp is mitochondria. certainly,
there ought to be a recognizeable energy
production mode which signals candidacy
for  xxxd3322xxx  potentiation.

[2]

conclusion
i have presented a cellular-level explanation for
the anomalous and provocative ma. 19 trial, based
on selective elimination of a small but aggressive
clone of mdr+ cancer cells. furthermore, i have
proposed a novel mechanism of cytotoxic potentiation in cancer, which could apply to the investigational agent  xxxd3322xxx . this hypothesis reconciles
the anomalous results of the ma. 19 breast cancer
trial with much of the pre-clinical literature on
 xxxd3322xxx . essentially, i propose  xxxd3322xxx  to
be an activating substrate of an over-expressed
membrane bound drug efflux pump (probably p-glycoprotein); this, exacerbated by the addition of
classical p-gp substrate chemotherapies, greatly
enhances atp hydrolysis by the pump which in
turn, necessitates compensatory atp generation
via the defective or otherwise co-opted mitochondria which characterize cancer cells. the result is
the generation of intolerable levels of ros which
overwhelm the cellâ€™s defensive capacities. some
role for small quantities of intracellular chemotherapy is not excluded, but most of the chemotherapy remains extracellular;  xxxd3322xxx  is not,
substantially, a p-gp inhibitor in the clinic. normal
cells are not affected, even if they express p-gp or
other abc transporters, since they can boost energy supply without lethal ros production.  xxxd3322xxx , which has already demonstrated a large
survival benefit in one advanced breast cancer
trial, is also potentially useful in cancers other than
breast cancer and could be effective wherever the
use of anthracyclines or taxanes is frustrated by
drug resistance pumps. this is because the predominance of the benefit in ma. 19 lay with the er negative patients; furthermore the diverse origins of
the cell lines potentiated by  xxxd3322xxx  in vitro
and in vivo, supports the generalisability of the
 xxxd3322xxx  benefit into multiple tumour types.
 xxxd3322xxx , and its mechanism of action, could
be amongst the most important recent discoveries
in oncologic therapeutics.
