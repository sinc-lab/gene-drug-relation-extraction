abstract. mineralocorticoid activity of several a43-ketosteroids and their 5a-dihydro analogs were evaluated by bioassay using urinary na:k ratio of adrenalectomized rats as an index of mineralocorticoid activity.
among a4-3-ketosteroids, aldosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, cortisol, 11-dehydrocorticosterone, and cortisone showed mineralocorticoid activity
with aldosterone, the most potent of the series, showing
virtually maximum activity at a dose of 0.25 /tg/rat. 5adihydroaldosterone and 5a-dihydro-ll-deoxycorticosterone possessed distinct mineralocorticoid activity, al-

a

mong a4-3-ketosteroids, aldosterone and
l 11-deoxycorticosterone1 are well known
as potent mineralocorticoids, and corticosterone and cortisol also possess some mineralocorticoid activity (1). to evaluate the effect of
reduction of the 4,5 double bond of a4-3-ketosteroids on mineralocorticoid activity, various 5a-dihydro analogs were bioassayed using
the decrease of urinary na:k ratio of adrenalectomized rats as an index of mineralocorticoid activity. the present paper describes the
results.

the following trivial names are used: 11-dehydrocorticosterone: pregn-4-en-21-ol-3,ll, xxxd103xxx ; 11-deoxycortisol: pregn-4-ene-17, 21-diol-3,20-dione; 17- xxxd2303xxx : pregn-4-en-17-ol-3,20-dione; 5a-dihydroaldosterone: 5a-pregnan-18-al-ll/?,21-diol-3,20-dione; 5adihydrocorticosterone: 5a - pregnane -11)8,21 - diol - 3,20 dione; 5a - dihydrocortisol: 5a - pregnane -11)8,17,21 - triol 3,20-dione; 5a-dihydro-ll-dehydrocorticosterone: 5apregnan-21-ol-3,ll, xxxd103xxx ; 5a-dihydrocortisone: 5apregnane-17,21-diol-3,ll, xxxd103xxx ; 5a-dihydro-ll-deoxycorticosterone: 5a-pregnan-21-ol-3,20-dione; 5a-dihydro11-deoxycortisol: 5a-pregnane-17,21-diol-3,20-dione; 5adihydroprogesterone: 5a-pregnane-3,20-dione; 5a-dihydro- 17- xxxd2303xxx : 5a-pregnan- 17-ol-3,20dione.

beit less than aldosterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone.
5a-dihydrocorticosterone, 5o-dihydrocortisol, 5a-dihydro-11-dehydrocorticosterone, and 5a-dihydrocortisone
did not show mineralocorticoid activity in doses up to
100 /ig/rat. it is concluded that reduction of the 4,5
double bond diminishes mineralocorticoid activity of
a4-3-ketosteroids. nevertheless, 5a-dihydroaldosterone
has distinct mineralocorticoid activity with potency of
1.8% of that of aldosterone and approximately the same
as that of 11-deoxycorticosterone. (endocrinology 103:
1450,1978)

materials and methods
materials
aldosterone, corticosterone, cortisol, 11-dehydrocorticosterone, cortisone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, progesterone, 17- xxxd2303xxx , 5a-dihydroprogesterone, and 5a-dihydro-17- xxxd2303xxx  were obtained from
steraloids, inc. 5a-dihydroaldosterone, 5a-dihydrocorticosterone, 5a-dihydrocortisol, 5a-dihydro11-dehydrocorticosterone, 5a-dihydrocortisone, 5adihydro- 11-deoxycorticosterone, and 5a-dihydro11-deoxycortisol were purchased from makor
chemicals ltd.
mineralocorticoid bioassay
mineralocorticoid bioassays were performed as
described previously (2, 3). the method, in brief, is
as follows: male albino rats weighing 120-150 g were
bilaterally adrenalectomized under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia and then fasted overnight. the
following day, 3 ml normal saline and unknown
samples or aldosterone standard (0.05, 0.125, and
0.25 /ig), dissolved in 0.5 ml 10% ethanol, were
injected into five or six rats ip. for control, 3 ml
normal saline and 0.5 ml 10% ethanol were injected
into eight or nine rats. the rats were killed 3 h
later, and the urine was aspirated from the bladders. the concentrations of sodium and potassium
in the urine were measured with a flame photometer. the na:k ratio was used as an index of mineralocorticoid activity; the greater the mineralocor-

ticoid activity, the lower the na:k ratio. when the
na:k ratio of a sample was significantly lower than
that of control (student's t test, p < 0.05), the
sample was considered to have mineralocorticoid
activity. the index of precision for these bioassays
ranged between 0.2 and 0.3.

results
the results of mineralocorticoid bioassays
of a4-3-ketosteroids and their 5a-dihydro analogs are shown in fig. 1. among a4-3-ketosteroids, aldosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone,
corticosterone, cortisol, 11-dehydrocorticosterone, and cortisone showed mineralocorticoid activity. among their 5a-dihydro analogs,
5a-dihydroaldosterone and 5a-dihydro-11deoxycorticosterone showed mineralocorticoid activity. however, in doses up to 100 jug,
5a-dihydrocorticosterone, 5a-dihydrocortisol,
5a-dihydro-11-dehydrocorticosterone, and 5adihydrocortisone failed to show mineralocorticoid activity.

dosterone and 5a-dihydro-11-deoxycorticosterone was evaluated further in three serial
bioassays performed on different days. the
results are shown in tables 1 and 2. both 5adihydroaldosterone and 5a-dihydro-11-deoxycorticosterone reproducibly showed mineralocorticoid activity.
dose-response curves of 5a-dihydroaldosterone and 5a-dihydro-11-deoxycorticosterone
are compared with those of aldosterone and
11-deoxycorticosterone in fig. 2. the mineralocorticoid activity of 5a-dihydroaldosterone
was 0.018 (0.007-0.047) times as potent as
aldosterone {mean potency estimate [and 95%
confidence limits (4)]}, approximately the
same as that of 11-deoxycorticosterone. the
mineralocorticoid activity of 5a-dihydro-11deoxycorticosterone was 0.025 (0.007-0.11)
times as potent as 11-deoxycorticosterone.

recently, marver and edelman found that
5a-dihydrocortisol binds with high affinity to
aldosterone receptors of rat kidney and stimulates sodium transport in the isolated toad
bladder (6, 7). in the present study, 100 /ig 5adihydrocortisol did not show mineralocorticoid activity. the basis for such a discrepancy
is not clear other than the fact that the in vivo
assay system differs from the in vitro systems
in many obvious respects.
in the present study, 5a-dihydroaldosterone
was found to be a relatively potent mineralocorticoid. using rat livers, kohler et al. (8)
have demonstrated that aldosterone is converted to 5a-dihydroaldosterone and inferred
that the dihydro derivative, in turn, is further
reduced to tetrahydroaldosterone. whether or
not endogenous 5a-dihydroaldosterone is ever
present in quantities sufficient to exert important physiological effects is not known at the
present time.

known to be potent mineralocorticoids, and
corticosterone and cortisol also have weak
mineralocorticoid activity (1). saturation of
the 4,5 double bond of a4-3-ketosteroids is
generally supposed to result in reduction of
physiological activity (5). the present study
demonstrated that the saturation of the 4,5
double bond truly reduced mineralocorticoid
activity of a4-3-ketosteroids. after reduction
of the 4,5 double bond, all steroids studied lost
mineralocorticoid activity, although 5a-dihydroaldosterone and 5a-dihydro-ll-deoxycorticosterone did possess appreciable mineralocorticoid activity.
