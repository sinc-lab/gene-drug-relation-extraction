 xxxd348xxx  for percutaneous coronary intervention and in acute coronary syndromes.  this review focuses on the use of  xxxd348xxx  as a replacement anticoagulant for heparin in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, or who are being treated for unstable angina pectoris, st-elevation, or non-st-elevation myocardial infarction. potential advantages of  xxxd348xxx  include a lack of dependence on  xxxg2056xxx  for anticoagulant activity, the ability to inactivate both fibrin-bound and soluble thrombin, a lack of aggregatory effects on platelets, a predictable anticoagulant response without monitoring, and a wider therapeutic window. clinical trial results to date suggest that bivlirudin is at least as effective as heparin with superior safety due to lower bleeding rates.
