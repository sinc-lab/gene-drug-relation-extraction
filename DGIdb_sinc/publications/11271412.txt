and  xxxd2637xxx  block its discriminative stimulus properties in rats

abstract rationale: the discriminative stimulus (ds)
properties of the selective serotonin (5-ht) uptake inhibitor (ssri), citalopram, are mediated by 5-ht2c receptors.
interestingly, the “atypical” antidepressants,  xxxd2637xxx  and
mirtazapine, behave as antagonists at 5-ht2c receptors.
objective: herein, we evaluated the influence of  xxxd2637xxx  and mirtazapine upon the ds effects of citalopram.
methods: in a two-lever drug discrimination procedure,
rats initially trained to discriminate citalopram (2.5 mg/kg,
i.p.) from saline were retrained with a lower dose of citalopram (0.63 mg/kg, i.p.). subsequently, generalization
and antagonist studies were conducted with  xxxd2637xxx  and
mirtazapine. results: both dose-dependently blocked, but
did not generalize to, the ds properties of citalopram
without markedly disrupting response rates. their effective dose50s were 0.1 and 1.4 mg/kg, s.c., respectively.
conclusion: these observations are consistent with a role
of 5-ht2c receptors in mediation of the interoceptive
properties of ssris and suggest that the ds effects of citalopram are not related to its “antidepressant” properties
per se. finally, they underline the distinctive nature of
mirtazapine and  xxxd2637xxx  as compared to antidepressant
agents which interact with 5-ht uptake sites.

1999) and rats (marona-lewicka and nichols 1998;
millan et al. 1999a, b) to recognize the discriminative
stimulus (ds) elicited by selective serotonin (5-ht) uptake inhibitors (ssris). in this light, two fundamental
and interrelated questions arise: first, the receptorial
mechanisms underlying their ds properties and, second,
whether other classes of antidepressant agent generalize
to ds elicited by an ssri, as might be expected if its ds
effects were related to “antidepressant” properties per se.
as concerns the first of these questions, we recently
demonstrated that, in analogy to other functional actions
of ssris, such as hypophagia (grignaschi et al. 1998)
and increased anxiety (dekeyne et al. 2000), activation
of 5-ht2c receptors contributes to the ds properties of
citalopram. this is particularly intriguing inasmuch as
several, clinically effective antidepressants possess antagonist properties at 5-ht2c receptors (de boer 1996;
sambunaris et al. 1997; sitsen and zivkov 1998), most
notably, the “atypical” antidepressants,  xxxd2637xxx  and
mirtazapine, which do not modulate monoamine uptake
(millan et al. 2000; sperling and demling 1997).
clearly, an evaluation of the influence of  xxxd2637xxx 
and mirtazapine upon the ds properties of citalopram
would provide additional information concerning a potential role of 5-ht2c receptors, and yield important insights into whether all classes of antidepressant share the
interoceptive properties of ssris.

introduction
although antidepressant agents have generally proven
refractory to conventional drug discrimination techniques (see, for example, jones et al. 1980; shearman et
al. 1978; zhang and barrett 1991a), several recent studies have succeeded in training pigeons (wolff and leander

materials and methods
animals
male wistar rats (180–200 g body weight upon arrival; iffa-credo,
l’arbresle, france) were housed individually in sawdust-lined
standard macrolon cages with free access to water and restricted
access to chow (10–11 g per day) in order to maintain their weight
at 80% of free-feeding weight. they were kept under a 12 h/12 h
light-dark cycle with lights on  xxxd2274xxx :00 a.m. laboratory temperature
was 21±1.0°c and humidity 60±5%. all animal use procedures
conformed to international european ethics standards (86/609cee) and the french national committee (décret 87/848) for the
care and use of laboratory animals.

experimental procedure
the experimental procedure was described in detail previously
(dekeyne et al. 1999). briefly, rats were trained to discriminate citalopram (2.5 mg/kg) from saline in operant conditioning chambers equipped with two levers. they were reinforced with food according to a fixed ratio 10 schedule of reinforcement. training
was undertaken by the i.p. route to avoid potential cutaneous toxicity. each 15-min daily session (5 days/week) started 15 min after
injection. during citalopram sessions, responses on only one lever
were reinforced while, during saline sessions, responses on the
other lever were reinforced. citalopram (c) or saline (s) sessions
alternated as follows: csscs-sccss-scscc-cscsc-, etc. correct responding was defined as no more than 13 presses on both
levers to obtain the first reinforcement. the present study was performed on the same group of rats previously employed for our
studies of the citalopram ds (millan et al. 1999a, b). however,
long-term utilization of citalopram at a training dose of 2.5 mg/kg,
i.p. was progressively associated with aberrant “citalopram” lever
selection during the saline training sessions. consequently, according to our rigorous testing criteria, which was correct lever responding on the two most recent training days, the population selectable for testing decreased over time. one solution to maintaining coherent patterns of response emerged to be a reduction in the
original training dose from 2.5 to 0.63 mg/kg, i.p.. the latter dose
was employed for the present studies. with this new training dose,
the discrimination criterion (10 consecutive sessions with correct
responding) was re-obtained after 25±3 sessions for a total of seven rats. subsequently, generalization tests were conducted (every
wednesday and friday, whereas training sessions continued on the
other days) with citalopram itself, but given by the s.c. route
15 min before the test session. thereafter, four rats showed dosedependent and full generalization yielding an effective dose50
(ed50) [95% confidence limits (95% cl)] of 1.1 (0.5–2.4) mg/kg.
they were selected for this study with  xxxd2637xxx  and mirtazapine.
as usual, each was tested once for each dose. the compounds
were administered (s.c.) either instead of the training dose of citalopram (0.63 mg/kg, i.p.) 15 min before the test session (generalization studies) or 30 min prior to the training dose of citalopram
(antagonism studies).
data analysis
data recorded during a test session were lever selection, i.e., the
lever on which ten presses were recorded first, and response rates,
i.e., the total number of presses on both levers. lever selection data were expressed as the percentage of rats selecting the drug lever
and were compared by a fisher's exact probability test to control
values (0% in generalization studies and 100% in antagonist studies). ed50s plus 95% cl were calculated to estimate drug potency.
response rates in the presence of drug were compared by a paired
t-test to response rates obtained during the preceding saline (or
drug, in antagonist studies) training session.
drugs
citalopram hydrobromide, (±)-mirtazapine, and  xxxd2637xxx  hcl
were synthesized by g. lavielle (i.d.r.s., croissy, france). they
were dissolved in sterile water. for mirtazapine and  xxxd2637xxx , a
few drops of lactic acid were added and the ph adjusted to as
close to neutrality as possible (ph>5.0). doses are in terms of the
base.

case (p>0.05; paired t-test), as compared to vehicle

rates observed at the highest dose tested did not reach significance (p>0.05) (fig. 1). when administered instead
of the training dose of citalopram,  xxxd2637xxx  (2.5 mg/kg,
s.c.) did not significantly generalize nor decrease response rates (percentage “citalopram” lever selection =
25%; percentage response rates = 102±8%). mirtazapine
dose-dependently suppressed the ds properties of citalopram with an ed50 (95% cl) of 0.10 (0.02–0.15) mg/kg,
and it did not significantly modify response rates (fig. 1).
at a dose of 0.16 mg/kg, s.c., mirtazapine did not generalize to citalopram nor decrease response rates (percentage “citalopram” lever selection = 25%; percentage response rates = 112±8).

discussion
results
 xxxd2637xxx  dose-dependently and completely blocked the
ds effects of citalopram with an ed50 (95% cl) of 1.4
(0.7–2.8) mg/kg (fig. 1). the 46% reduction in response

both mirtazapine and  xxxd2637xxx  dose-dependently inhibited the ds elicited by citalopram. notably, their relative and absolute potencies (0.1 and 1.4 mg/kg, respectively) correspond closely to those which block ds
properties of the 5-ht2c agonist, ro60,0175; that is,

391

0.1 and 0.7 mg/kg, respectively (dekeyne et al. 1999;
millan et al. 2000). although it cannot be formally excluded that other actions of mirtazapine and  xxxd2637xxx 
might be involved (broekkamp et al. 1995), these observations support the argument that a similar mechanism
is implicated in the present effects, that is, blockade of
5-ht2c receptors. this argument is underpinned by the
finding that the highly selective 5-ht2c antagonist,
sb242,084, likewise blocks the ds properties of both
ro60,0175 and citalopram (dekeyne et al. 1999; millan
et al. 1999a).
the present findings with  xxxd2637xxx  and mirtazapine
differentiate them from other classes of antidepressant
which inhibit 5-ht uptake and generalize to citalopram:
ssris, such as sertraline (marona-lewicka and nichols
1998; millan et al. 1999b), mixed 5-ht/noradrenaline
uptake inhibitors, such as venlafaxine (gobert et al.
1998), and tricyclics, such as clomipramine (millan and
dekeyne, unpublished observation). the present data
are, thus, consistent with other studies indicating that  xxxd2637xxx  and mirtazapine possess a distinctive mechanism
of action (de boer 1996; millan et al. 2000; sambunaris
et al. 1997; sperling and demling 1997).
intriguingly, 100% generalization with the s.c. route
was obtained only at a dose eightfold higher than the
training dose of 0.63 mg/kg, i.p. and superior to that
which previously generalized to the training dose of
2.5 mg/kg, i.p. (millan et al. 1999a, b). changes in drug
potency in long-term drug discrimination studies have
been previously documented (see, for example, zhang
and barrett 1991b) and, presumably, a change of sensitivity to the s.c. route underlies this decrease of potency. indeed, the present work was undertaken in rats
which had received citalopram for an extended period
(over a year) and long-term administration of ssris has
been shown to modify sensitivity at 5-ht2c receptors
(bristow et al. 2000; quested et al. 1997). nevertheless,
this alteration of responsiveness to citalopram (s.c.)
does not compromise interpretation of the effects of
mirtazapine and  xxxd2637xxx , the antagonist actions of
which are consistent with previous findings concerning
their 5-ht2c antagonist properties in drug discrimination and other functional models (dekeyne et al. 1999;
millan et al. 2000).
an obvious caveat of the present study is the small
number of rats tested; only four rats showing dose-dependent generalization to s.c. administration of citalopram itself were studied. however, mirtazapine and  xxxd2637xxx  showed similar actions and the data are pharmacologically coherent with those of previous studies (vide
ut supra). further, in view of the considerable difficulties confronted in drug discrimination studies with ssris
(see introduction and wolff and leander 1999), it may
well prove difficult to obtain a more substantial number
of animals discriminating citalopram and available for
characterization.
finally, although the present and previous data
(millan et al. 1999a) support a role of 5-ht2c receptors
in the ds properties of citalopram, a role of other recep-

tor types in the ds properties of ssris should not be
excluded.
in conclusion, in contrast to ssris (millan et al.
1999b) which generalize to a citalopram ds,  xxxd2637xxx 
and mirtazapine, both blocked the citalopram ds. these
findings are consistent with a role of 5-ht2c receptors in
mediation of the ds properties of the ssri, citalopram,
and suggest that, rather than being related to “antidepressant” properties per se, the ds effects of citalopram reflect other functional actions. further, the data underpin
the distinctive mechanism of action of  xxxd2637xxx  and
mirtazapine as compared to antidepressant agents which
modulate monoamine uptake.
