abstract
most prostate cancers (pcs) become resistant to combined androgen
blockade therapy with surgical or medical castration and antiandrogens
after several years. some of these refractory pcs regress after discontinuation of antiandrogen administration [antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome (aws)]. although the molecular mechanisms of the aws are not
fully understood because of the lack of suitable experimental models, one
hypothesis of the mechanism is mutation of  xxxg183xxx  (ar).
however,  xxxd334xxx , which has become the most prevalent pure antiandrogen, does not work as an agonist for any mutant ar detected thus
far in pc. to elucidate the mechanisms of the aws, we established and
characterized novel lncap cell sublines, lncap-cxds, which were generated in vitro by culturing androgen-dependent lncap-fgc human pc
cells in androgen-depleted medium with  xxxd334xxx  to mimic the combined androgen blockade therapy. lncap-fgc cells did not grow at first,
but they started to grow after 6 –13 weeks of culture.  xxxd334xxx  stimulated lncap-cxd cell growth and increased  xxxg1281xxx 
secretion from lncap-cxd cells both in vitro and in vivo. sequencing of
ar transcripts revealed that the ar in lncap-cxd cells harbors a novel
mutation in codon 741, tgg (tryptophan) to tgt (cysteine; w741c), or
in codon 741, tgg to ttg (leucine; w741l), in the ligand-binding
domain. transactivation assays showed that  xxxd334xxx  worked as an
agonist for both w741c and w741l mutant ars. importantly, another
antiandrogen, hydroxyflutamide, worked as an antagonist for these mutant ars. in summary, we demonstrate for the first time that within only
6 –13 weeks of in vitro exposure to  xxxd334xxx , lncap-fgc cells, whose
growth had initially been suppressed, came to use  xxxd334xxx  as an ar
agonist via w741 ar mutation to survive. our data strongly support the
hypothesis that ar mutation is one possible mechanism of the aws and
suggest that  xxxd2143xxx  might be effective as a second-line therapy for
refractory pc previously treated with  xxxd334xxx .

aws are still unclear because of the lack of suitable experimental
models. one possible mechanism responsible for the aws is mutation
of ar because hydroxyflutamide, the active metabolite of an antiandrogen  xxxd2143xxx , works as an agonist for some mutant ars (4 – 6).
however, to our knowledge,  xxxd334xxx , which has become the
most prevalent pure antiandrogen, does not act as an agonist for any
mutant ar detected thus far in pc, although  xxxd334xxx  also induces the  xxxd334xxx  withdrawal syndrome (2, 3). nor have we
verified that the ar gene in pc cells is altered by antiandrogens.
therefore, we could not confirm that ar mutation is the cause of the
aws. in this study, we established novel lncap cell sublines by in
vitro long-term culture of lncap-fgc cells in the presence of  xxxd334xxx . the characterization of these cell lines directly reveals
that pc cells can alter their ar gene in such a way as to use
 xxxd334xxx  as an ar agonist to survive.

materials and methods

cell culture. the human pc cell line lncap-fgc (dainippon pharmaceutical co., ltd., osaka, japan) was maintained in rpmi 1640 with 10% fbs
(trace scientific ltd., melbourne, australia). after lncap-fgc cells started
growing in phenol red-free rpmi 1640 with 10% dcc-fbs in the presence
and absence of  xxxd334xxx  (purchased as  xxxd334xxx  tablets and extracted in
our company), the cell lines were designated as lncap-cxd (lncap-cxd2,
-cxd11, and -cxd12) and lncap-hr, respectively. lncap-cxd2 and lncapcxd12 were maintained in phenol red-free rpmi 1640 with 10% dcc-fbs in
the presence of 1 ␮m  xxxd334xxx , and lncap-cxd11 was maintained in
phenol red-free rpmi 1640 with 10% dcc-fbs in the presence of 0.1 ␮m
 xxxd334xxx . lncap-hr was maintained in phenol red-free rpmi 1640 with
10% dcc-fbs. dcc-fbs was prepared by incubating 500 ml of fbs with 25
ml of dcc solution (5% charcoal activated; sigma, st louis, mo) and 0.05%

ar mutation in  xxxd334xxx  withdrawal syndrome

diameter perpendicular to a. at the end of experiments, blood samples were
obtained to measure the serum psa levels.
sequencing of cdna after reverse transcription-pcr. total rna was
isolated from lncap cell lines, and cdna was synthesized using avian
myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase xl (takara shuzo co., ltd., shiga,
japan). the entire ar protein-coding region was amplified by pcr with seven
sets of oligonucleotide primers [5⬘-gcctgttgaactcttctgag-3⬘ and
5⬘-tgtccttggaggaagtgggag-3⬘, 5⬘-aagcccatcgtagaggcccca-3⬘ and 5⬘-ggaaagttgtagtagtcgcgactctg-3⬘, 5⬘-gcactggacgaggcagctgcgtac-3⬘ and 5⬘-ccaccacacggtccatacaact-3⬘, 5⬘-cgcatcaagctggagaacccgctg-3⬘ and 5⬘-caggtgcggtgaagtcgctttcct-3⬘, 5⬘-acagccgaagaaggccagttgt-3⬘
and 5⬘-acacactacacctggctcaat-3⬘, 5⬘-cagtgtcacacattgaaggct-3⬘ and 5⬘-cttgcacagagatgatctctgc-3⬘, and 5⬘-gtcctggaagccattgagcca-3⬘ and 5⬘-caggcagaagacatctgaaag-3⬘),
some of which were synthesized in reference to previously published sequences (7). both sense and antisense dna strands of the pcr products were
directly sequenced with the abi prism big dye terminator cycle sequencing
kit (applied biosystems, tokyo, japan). the mutation in codon 741 (tgg to
tgt and tgg to ttg) was confirmed in two independent pcr-amplified
dna fragments. furthermore, independently, pcr amplifications of the entire
ar protein-coding region were performed with cdna from lncap-cxd2
cells using two sets of primers (5⬘-gatgccgcgggccaccatggaagtgcagttagggctgggaag-3⬘ and 5⬘-gatgggtaccacacatcaggtgcggtgaag-3⬘, and 5⬘-gatgggtaccctggcggcatggtgagcagag-3⬘ and 5⬘-gatgccgcgggcggccgcctgggtgtggaaatagatgggcttgac-3⬘). the pcr products were cloned, and three
clones each were sequenced. the mutation in codon 741 (tgg to tgt) was
found in two of the three clones. in contrast, the mutation in codon 741 was not
detected in any of the 27 cloned pcr-amplified ar transcripts from lncapfgc cells.
site-directed mutagenesis. the ar coding region amplified by pcr from
transcripts of lncap-cxd2 cells was inserted into pcdna3.1. the single
mutants w741c, w741l, and t877a and the wild-type ar expression plasmids were created with three primer sets (5⬘-agagagctggcatcagttcacttttgacctgctaatcaag-3⬘ and 5⬘-cttgattagcaggtcaaaagtgaactgagtcagctctct-3⬘, 5⬘-ctgtcattcagtactccttgatggggctcatggtgtttg-3⬘ and 5⬘-caaacaccatgagccccatcaaggagtactgaatgacag-3⬘, and 5⬘-ctgtcattcagtactcctggatggggctcatggtgtttg-3⬘ and 5⬘-caaacaccatgagccccatccaggagtactgaatgacag-3⬘) by site-directed oligonucleotide mutagenesis using the quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (stratagene, la
jolla, ca. these constructs were confirmed by dna sequencing.
transactivation assays. after cos-7 cells were cotransfected with
pcdna3.1-ar and  xxxg2041xxx -psa-luc vector, which consists of two tandem psa
promoter and the luciferase gene, by using superfect transfection reagent
(qiagen, hilden, germany), these cells were trypsinized and seeded equally
into 96-well plates at 1 ⫻ 104 cells/well in phenol red-free dmem with 10%
dcc-fbs (2 ng of pcdna3.1-ar and 60 ng of  xxxg2041xxx -psa-luc vector/well).
drugs were added 3 h after transfection. after a 24-h incubation at 37°c in a
5% co2 atmosphere, luciferase activity in the cell lysate was measured using
the steady-glo luciferase assay system (promega, madison, wi) and the
wallac 1420 arvo sx multilabel counter (eg&g wallac, turku, finland).
statistical analysis. differences between the control group and the drugtreated groups were analyzed by unpaired student’s t test (fig. 1) or dunnett’s
test (figs. 2 and 3). p ⬍ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

in each case, it took less than 13 weeks for lncap-fgc cells to start
growing. to our knowledge, this is the first study that shows the
establishment of  xxxd334xxx -resistant cell lines by incubation of pc
cells with  xxxd334xxx . we also established another cell line, lncaphr, which was generated in vitro by culturing lncap-fgc cells in
androgen-depleted medium without  xxxd334xxx  to mimic the clinical
situation in which pc patients receive castration monotherapy. in this
case, lncap-fgc cells started to grow after less than 4 weeks of
culture. the steady-state levels of the ar determined by immunoblot
analysis in lncap-cxd2, lncap-cxd11, lncap-cxd12, and lncaphr cells are 0.93-, 1.3-, 0.97-, and 2.0-fold as high as that in parental
lncap-fgc cells (data not shown). the steady-state psa levels in
lncap-cxd2, lncap-cxd11, lncap-cxd12, and lncap-hr cells
are 0.99-, 1.4-, 2.3-, and 0.65-fold as high as that in parental
lncap-fgc cells (data not shown).
in cell growth studies, withdrawal of  xxxd334xxx  from culture
media suppressed lncap-cxd2 cell proliferation (fig. 1a) and reduced secretion of psa, a marker of pc (1), in lncap-cxd2 cells
(fig. 1b). because these findings are consistent with clinically observed aws (2, 3), lncap-cxd2 cells might be an appropriate model
for studying the mechanisms of aws.  xxxd334xxx  stimulated lncapcxd2 cell proliferation in a biphasic manner, with a peak at 1 ␮m
(fig. 2a). because androgen stimulated lncap-fgc cell proliferation also in a biphasic manner (ref. 8; data not shown), our data
suggest that  xxxd334xxx  might become an ar agonist in lncapcxd2 cells. consistently,  xxxd334xxx  increased psa secretion, a
marker of androgen action, in a dose-dependent manner in lncapcxd2 cells (fig. 2b), as androgen increased psa secretion in a
dose-dependent manner in lncap-fgc cells (data not shown). the
growth curve of lncap-cxd12 was quite similar to that of lncapcxd2 in that the peak was at 1 ␮m  xxxd334xxx  (fig. 2, a and c),
where both of these two cell lines were maintained. the growth curve
of lncap-cxd11 was also bell-shaped (fig. 2c). interestingly, the
growth-promoting concentrations in lncap-cxd11 cells, which were
maintained with 0.1 ␮m  xxxd334xxx , were lower than those in
lncap-cxd2 and lncap-cxd12 (fig. 2, a and c), suggesting that
lncap-fgc cells could elaborately adapt to the culture condition, the
 xxxd334xxx  concentration in the medium. psa secretion was increased in a dose-dependent manner by  xxxd334xxx  in both lncapcxd11 and lncap-cxd12 cells (fig. 2d). these findings suggest that
 xxxd334xxx  might also become an ar agonist in both lncap-cxd11
and lncap-cxd12 cells. in contrast to lncap-cxd cells,  xxxd334xxx  inhibited proliferation (fig. 1a and fig. 2a) and reduced psa
secretion (fig. 1b and fig. 2b) in lncap-fgc and lncap-hr cells.
 xxxd334xxx  also reduced androgen-induced psa secretion (data not

we established and characterized a novel lncap pc cell subline,
lncap-cxd2, which was generated in vitro by long-term culture of
lncap-fgc cells in androgen-depleted medium with 1 ␮m  xxxd334xxx  to mimic the clinical situation in which pc patients receive
medical or surgical castration in combination with antiandrogen therapy. lncap-fgc cells did not grow at first but started to grow after
approximately 6 weeks of culture. independently, we established two
other cell lines by the same method with 0.1 and 1 ␮m  xxxd334xxx 
and designated them lncap-cxd11 and lncap-cxd12, respectively.

transcripts except those in codon 741 were the same among these
three cell lines. furthermore, we sequenced the ligand-binding domain of the ar transcripts in lncap-cxd11 and lncap-cxd12 cells.
we found exactly the same w741c mutation in lncap-cxd12 cells
(fig. 4). surprisingly, we detected another point mutation in codon
741, tgg to ttg (leucine; w741l), in addition to the t877a
mutation in lncap-cxd11 cells (fig. 4). our data suggest that the
switch of  xxxd334xxx  from antagonist to agonist in lncap-cxd cell
lines might depend on an additional ar mutation in codon 741 and
that the emergence of the mutation might require the existence of
 xxxd334xxx .
to clarify the role of the ar mutation in codon 741 on conversion
of  xxxd334xxx  to an agonist, we assessed the transcriptional responses to  xxxd334xxx  of the wild-type; the single mutants w741c,
w741l, and t877a; and the double mutants w741c/t877a and
w741l/t877a ars in transactivation assays. interestingly, the single

day,  xxxd334xxx  (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, or 20 ␮m) was added. after 3 days, cells were

lncap-cxd11 (f) and lncap-cxd12 (e) cells were plated in a 24-well plate (4 ⫻ 104

0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, or 30 ␮m) was added. after 3 days, cells were counted, and the
culture medium was collected for measurement of psa levels. a and c, growth; b and d,

shown), demonstrating that  xxxd334xxx  remains an antagonist in
lncap-fgc and lncap-hr cells. our results suggest that lncapfgc cells could survive even under the growth-suppressive pressure
of  xxxd334xxx  by changing their ar functions in such a way as to
use  xxxd334xxx  as an agonist and also by adjusting the intensity of
ar signals to their optimum. our data also suggest that the switch of
 xxxd334xxx  from antagonist to agonist might require the presence
of  xxxd334xxx .
to determine whether  xxxd334xxx  also promotes tumor growth in
vivo, we established castrated nude mouse models of lncap-cxd2
and lncap-hr tumor xenografts.  xxxd334xxx  significantly accelerated lncap-cxd2 tumor growth (fig. 3a). furthermore, blood psa
levels in mice bearing lncap-cxd2 tumors were significantly increased by  xxxd334xxx  (fig. 3b). in contrast,  xxxd334xxx  significantly inhibited lncap-hr tumor growth (fig. 3c). consistently,
blood psa levels in mice bearing lncap-hr tumors were significantly decreased by  xxxd334xxx  (fig. 3d). our results demonstrate
that  xxxd334xxx  promotes lncap-cxd2 tumor growth in vivo at the
doses lower than or equal to those at which  xxxd334xxx  inhibited
lncap-hr tumor growth.
to study the molecular mechanism for the change of ar functions
in lncap-fgc cells, we sequenced entire ar transcripts in lncapfgc, lncap-hr, and lncap-cxd2 cells. consistent with previous
findings (9, 10), we detected only the t877a mutation in lncapfgc and lncap-hr cells (fig. 4). in contrast, we detected a novel
mutation in codon 741, tgg (tryptophan) to tgt (cysteine; w741c),
in the ligand-binding domain in addition to the t877a mutation in
lncap-cxd2 cells (fig. 4). all nucleotide sequences of the ar

mutants w741c and w741l and the double mutant w741l/t877a
ars had a substantial transactivation response to  xxxd334xxx  (fig.
5). in contrast, the wild-type and the t877a mutant ars responded
only slightly to  xxxd334xxx  (fig. 5). our data demonstrate the
critical role of the ar mutation in codon 741 on the switch of
 xxxd334xxx  to an agonist. the sensitivity of the w741c and w741l
mutant ars is similar (fig. 5), which suggests that the elaborate
adaptation of lncap-fgc cells to the culture condition of  xxxd334xxx  levels (fig. 2, c and d) might not depend on the type of ar
mutation but on other mechanisms. surprisingly, the w741c/t877a
double mutant ar showed constitutively active characteristics in this
assay and did not become activated further by  xxxd334xxx  (fig. 5),
which is not consistent with the results in cell growth assays using
lncap-cxd2 or lncap-cxd12 cells (fig. 2). further study is required to clarify this discrepancy. it might depend on the difference of
the intracellular environments.
mutations in the ar in pcs have been well-documented (11–13).
several mutant ars such as t877a, t877s, h874y, v715m, and
l701h/t877a have a broadened spectrum of ligand responsiveness,
and hydroxyflutamide works as an agonist for these mutants (4 – 6).
however, to our knowledge,  xxxd334xxx  does not work as an agonist
for any mutant ar detected thus far in pc. therefore, this is the first
study showing that  xxxd334xxx  works as an agonist for mutant ars
in pc cells. furthermore, in this study, we demonstrate for the first
time in vitro that  xxxd334xxx  can cause the antiandrogen withdrawal
phenomenon via ar mutation in pc cells. our data strongly support
the hypothesis that ar mutation is one possible mechanism of the
aws, although mechanisms other than ar mutation may be also
involved in the aws (10).
because it took only 6 –13 weeks for  xxxd334xxx  to switch from
an antagonist to an agonist by the w741c mutation in ar, strong
mutation pressure from the presence of  xxxd334xxx  should be directed toward the emergence of a mutation in codon 741 in the ar
gene. it has been reported that t877 is a hot spot of the ar mutation
selected by treatment with  xxxd2143xxx  in pc patients (14), and the
w741c ar mutation has recently been discovered in recurrent pc
samples from patients treated with combined androgen blockade

therapy using  xxxd334xxx  (15). therefore, w741 may be a hot spot
of the mutation selected by treatment with  xxxd334xxx .
currently, the mechanism of the quick emergence of the mutant ar
in pc cells is unclear. to our knowledge, any single ar mutation
other than t877a has not been documented thus far in any cell line
derived from lncap; however, we cannot completely exclude the
possibility that lncap-fgc originally harbored cells with the double
mutant w741c/t877a or w741l/t877a ars. another possibility is
that mutation occurred spontaneously and randomly at an extremely
high rate, and cells that accidentally obtained the w741c or w741l
mutation were selected. recently, resistance to the abl  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitor sti-571, which is known as a molecular targeted drug, has
been reported to develop as a result of the t315i mutation in the target
protein, abl  xxxg2198xxx , in chronic myeloid leukemia (16). what
is common in both  xxxd334xxx  and sti-571 is that although cancer
cells have alternatives to depend on for growth-promoting signals
other than the drug-targeted protein, they stick to the drug-targeted
signal. the different point is that in this study, pc cells not only
became unresponsive to the antagonistic activity of  xxxd334xxx  but
also came to use  xxxd334xxx  as an agonist, whereas the t315i
mutant abl  xxxg2198xxx  is only unresponsive to sti-571 (16).
there might be some unknown mechanisms that pc could actively
make the ar gene mutated to survive against antiandrogens. although lncap cells, which are derived from a metastatic lesion of pc
and exist with an abnormal karyotype (17), may be unusually susceptible to selective pressure from antiandrogens, elucidation of the
molecular mechanisms for the quick emergence of the mutant ar
with this simple in vitro culture system using lncap-fgc cells might
help us to create drugs without drug resistance or drugs that prevent
drug resistance in the future.
it has been reported that  xxxd334xxx  is effective as a second-line
therapy for some pc that has been treated with a combined androgen
blockade therapy using  xxxd2143xxx  and contains the t877a mutant ar
(14). this observation is consistent with the findings that hydroxyflutamide worked as an agonist and  xxxd334xxx  worked as an antagonist for the t877a mutant ar in transactivation assays (ref. 4;
fig. 5). the single mutant w741c and w741l ars responded only
slightly to hydroxyflutamide (fig. 5), or rather hydroxyflutamide
blocked the action of dht for these mutant ars (fig. 6).  xxxd334xxx  could not block the action of dht for these mutant ars (fig.
6). our data suggest that after pc progresses during  xxxd334xxx 
administration,  xxxd2143xxx  might be effective as a second-line therapy.

ar mutation in  xxxd334xxx  withdrawal syndrome

in this study, we demonstrated in vitro that pc cells actively alter their
ar gene to convert antiandrogen into agonist. if we can predict with
this in vitro assay system which types of ar mutation emerge clinically when one antiandrogen is used for a long time, and if we can
design other antiandrogens effective for the emergent mutant ar, then
we could continue to control pc growth by serial antiandrogen treatment. alternatively, mixtures of several antiandrogens with different
chemical structures might be effective because there is an extremely
low possibility that ar will be altered in such a way as to become
activated by all of the different antiandrogens simultaneously.
