abstract: gaucher disease is a progressive lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deﬁciency
of glucocerebrosidase, and characterized by intralysosomal storage of glucosylceramide that leads
to dysfunction in multiple organ systems. intravenous enzyme replacement with  xxxd2336xxx  is
the accepted standard for treatment of symptomatic patients and has been effective in reducing
many of the signs and symptoms of type i gaucher disease in the majority of patients without
serious adverse effects. an alternative therapeutic approach is substrate reduction therapy with
n- xxxd2645xxx  ( xxxd2645xxx ) ( xxxd2645xxx ;  xxxd2645xxx ®), an imino sugar that reversibly inhibits glucosylceremide synthase and reduces intracellular storage of glucosylceramide.  xxxd2645xxx 
was recently approved in europe and the united states for symptomatic patients with mild to
moderate clinical manifestations for whom enzyme replacement therapy is not an option. this
review article discusses the results of clinical studies and use of  xxxd2645xxx  as a therapeutic agent
in patients with type i gaucher disease.

first described by dr. philippe gaucher in 1882, gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage
disorder that is caused by the deﬁciency of glucocerebrosidase, and is characterized
by the accumulation of glycosylceramide that leads to dysfunction in multiple organ
systems (beutler and grabowski 1995). three types of gaucher disease have been
described, but, actually, these represent different degrees of severity along a spectrum.
the clinical features of type i gaucher disease, the non-neuronopathic form, are splenomegaly, which is more prominent than the hepatomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia,
and bone lesions. type ii gaucher disease is the most severe form, which presents with
severe central nervous system involvement and is generally fatal within the ﬁrst 2 years
of life. type iii gaucher disease, the subacute neuronopathic form, presents in early
childhood with severe manifestations resembling type i (splenomegaly, hepatomegaly,
and bone lesions) and has a more chronic course with onset of neurological disease
towards the end of the ﬁrst decade (beutler and grabowski 1995).
in 1991, the advent of targeted enzyme replacement therapy (ert) using algucerase
(ceredase®; genzyme corporation) followed by the introduction of  xxxd2336xxx  (cerezyme®; genzyme corporation) resulted in huge improvements in the treatment of
patients with gaucher disease.  xxxd2336xxx  is a modiﬁed form of glucocerebrosidase,
created using recombinant dna technology, and is given as intravenous infusions,
usually every other week.  xxxd2336xxx  acts like the naturally occurring enzyme glucocerebrosidase to break down the glucosylceramide that has accumulated in gaucher
cells (barton et al 1991; grabowski et al 1998). in the majority of patients (90%),
ert has been effective in reducing many of the signs and symptoms of type i gaucher
disease but has no or limited effect on the neurologic ﬁndings of type ii and iii gaucher
disease because of its inability to cross the blood – brain barrier (weinreb et al 2002).

side effects (hypersensitivity reactions and neutralizing
antibodies) related to ert have been reported in less than
15% of type i gaucher patients (barton et al 1991; grabowski
et al 1998). life-long intravenous infusion every 2 weeks can
be a burden for some patients, particularly in those with poor
venous access. the high cost of ert also precludes its use
in some countries and burdens health care cost.
one of the key issues that researchers and pharmaceutical companies are still facing in the treatment of lysosomal
disorders including gaucher disease is the need to develop
cheaper new treatments that will decrease the cost, provide
easy administration of the drug, and improve and prevent
neurological disease. chemical chaperone therapy and gene
therapy hold great promise as future treatment options for
all three types of gaucher disease.
an oral treatment using a small molecule (substrate reduction therapy) is an available form of therapy for type i gaucher
disease (platt et al 2001). in 2002, n- xxxd2645xxx 
( xxxd2645xxx ) ( xxxd2645xxx ;  xxxd2645xxx ®, actelion pharmaceuticals),
a substrate reduction agent, was approved by epar and fda
as a treatment option for type i gaucher disease (epar 2002;
us fda 2003).
unlike ert,  xxxd2645xxx  is a small molecule and can pass
the blood – brain barrier and has the potential to be effective in treating lysosomal storage disorders with neurologic

manifestations. capablo et al (2007) recently reported that
combined  xxxd2336xxx  and  xxxd2645xxx  therapy improved
some neurological manifestations of type iii gaucher in an
adult patient.  xxxd2645xxx  has also been proposed for treatment of other lysosomal diseases like niemann pick type c,
tay-sachs, and fabry disease (abe et al 2000; andersson
et al 2004; hear et al 2007; patterson et al 2007).  xxxd2645xxx 
therapy has been unsuccessful in halting the progress of
infantile-onset tay-sachs disease (bembi et al 2006). patterson et al (2007) showed that  xxxd2645xxx  improved some neurologic symptoms of patients with nieman pick type c.
how effective is  xxxd2645xxx  as an alternative treatment to
ert for type i gaucher disease? the present review assesses
published clinical studies of  xxxd2645xxx  as a therapeutic agent
in patients with type i gaucher disease.

 xxxd2645xxx : substrate reduction
therapy
substrate reduction therapy is an alternative approach to treat
patients with gaucher disease.  xxxd2645xxx  ( xxxd2645xxx ) is one
of the n-alkylated iminosugars extracted from plants and
microorganisms, and inhibits glycosylceramide synthase,
which catalyzes the transfer of glucose from udp-glucose
to ceramide to form glucosylceramide (glccer) (figure 1).
the aim is to decrease the biosynthesis of glccer so that

 xxxd2645xxx  and gaucher disease

patients with signiﬁcant residual enzyme activity can break
down glccer more efﬁciently and thus allow clearance of
glccer from lysosomes (platt et al 2007).
imino sugars such as  xxxd2645xxx  can also target the protein
folding and trafﬁcking pathways of glycosidase to assist
correction of lysosomal enzyme activity (yam et al 2005)
(chaperone mediated therapy). a partial increase in enzyme
activity may be sufﬁcient to initiate the metabolic breakdown of glycosphyngolipids (gsl) and decrease the gsl
storage in lysosomes. the efﬁcacy of  xxxd2645xxx  in gaucher
disease type i probably results from both a decrease in the
biosynthesis of glccer and an increase in the activity of
glucocerebrosidase.

discovery and development
of  xxxd2645xxx 
in the 1990s norman radin hypothesized that it would be
possible to reduce the concentration of glycosphingolipids
substrates in the lysosomes by inhibiting their biosynthesis
(radin 1996, 2000; platt et al 2001). radin and colleagues
synthesized compounds such as 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1- xxxd3026xxx  (pdmp) to inhibit glccer
synthase, which is a key enzyme in glccer biosynthesis.
more recently, several homologues of pdmp have been
characterized (abe et al 1992, 2001). however, pdmp and
related compounds can inhibit cell growth, and cause undesirable cell death (barbour et al 1992; abe et al 1995). in
light of pdmp’s undesirable effects, compounds related to
pdmp that do not exhibit these effects were chosen and used
in several studies (abe et al 1992). several animal studies
also showed that depletion of gsl could be lethal or lead
to neurological disturbance, and substrate reduction therapy
should be aimed to reduce biosynthesis of gsl to a degree
that can be tolerated by cells (radin 1996).

 xxxd2645xxx , a compound originally developed as an
alpha-glucosidase inhibitor and structurally unrelated to
pdmp, is an n-alkylated imino sugar and is an inhibitor of
glccer synthase.  xxxd2645xxx  was initially developed for use as
an antiviral agent, because most enveloped viruses use the
same pathway for glycoprotein synthesis in infected cells.
using  xxxd2645xxx  to alter the glycosylation of envelope glycoproteins could decrease the infectivity in certain viral diseases
such as hiv. however, clinical trials on hiv patients were
unsuccessful because the antiviral concentrations of  xxxd2645xxx 
required could not be achieved in humans without a high
incidence of adverse effects (tierney et al 1995). these clinical trials provided valuable safety information that helped to
guide subsequent studies for srt in gaucher disease.

results of clinical trials of  xxxd2645xxx 
in patients with type-i gaucher
disease
the current clinical experience with  xxxd2645xxx  on type i
gaucher disease is based on the clinical studies undertaken
since 2000.
in april 2000, cox et al (2000) reported the results of
the ﬁrst clinical trial, a 1-year open label uncontrolled study.
twenty-eight adults with type i gaucher disease were treated
with 100 mg oral  xxxd2645xxx  3 times a day for 12 months (cox
et al 2000). twenty-two patients completed the study. spleen
and liver volumes were lowered by 19% (p  0.001) and
12% (p  0.001), respectively, over 12 months (table 1).
hematological markers such as hemoglobin and platelets
improved slightly.  xxxg444xxx  levels fell by 16.4%
(p  0.001) over 12 months (table 1). the most frequent
adverse effect was diarrhea, which occurred in 79% of
patients. two patients were withdrawn from the trial due
to peripheral neuropathy, which was reported as an adverse

effect of  xxxd2645xxx . based on these results, the epar and us
fda approved  xxxd2645xxx  ( xxxd2645xxx ®) for adult patients with
mild-moderate type i gaucher disease for whom enzyme
replacement therapy is not an option.
eighteen patients who completed the initial 12-month
clinical trial were enrolled in an extension study; 14 completed the 24-month extension study. elstein et al (2004)
reported the results of the extension study in 2004. liver and
spleen volumes diminished by 18% and 30%, respectively
(table 1). hemoglobin and platelets counts increased. no new
cases of peripheral neuropathy were reported. diarrhea and
weight loss decreased in magnitude and prevalence during the
second and third years. this trial suggests that adverse effects
diminished when the period of treatment was extended.
in 2002, heitner et al (2002) reported the result of a
6-month open label uncontrolled study in which 18 adult
patients with type i gaucher received low dose  xxxd2645xxx 
(50 mg 3 times a day). seventeen patients completed the
6-month study which reported the signiﬁcant mean percentage changes in liver (–5.9%) and spleen (–4.5%) volumes
and in  xxxg444xxx  levels (–4.6%) (table 1). the lower
dose of  xxxd2645xxx  (50 mg 3 times a day) did not produce the
same beneﬁcial effects delivered by the higher dose (100 mg
3 times a day) while patients suffered similar adverse effects
(diarrhea and weight loss)
sixteen patients were enrolled in a 6-month extension to
this study. after a total of 12 months’ treatment, spleen and
liver volumes, and  xxxg444xxx  levels decreased by only
10%, 6%, and 15%, respectively (table 1). there were no signiﬁcant changes in hemoglobin levels or platelets counts.
the third study was undertaken by elstein et al (2002).
it was an open label, controlled, 6-month trial to assess the
efﬁcacy of  xxxd2645xxx  as a maintenance therapy. thirty-six
patients who had received ert for a minimum 2 years were
enrolled in the study and randomized into one of three groups:
ert monotherapy,  xxxd2645xxx  monotherapy (100 mg 3 times a
day) and ert and  xxxd2645xxx  combined therapy. thirty-three
patients completed the study. no signiﬁcant differences were
noted among the three groups in terms of changes in liver
and spleen volumes and hemoglobin levels after 6 months
of treatment (table 1). the  xxxd2645xxx  monotherapy group
had a 33% increase in mean  xxxg444xxx  level compared
with both ert and combined treatment groups, both of
which recorded desired stable or decreased levels (table 1).
the  xxxd2645xxx  monotherapy group showed a mean absolute
decrease in platelet count (–21.6 × 109/l) while the other
two groups showed some absolute increase in platelet counts
(table 1). twenty-nine patients were enrolled in a 6-month

428

extension to this study. ert was discontinued and all patients
received only  xxxd2645xxx  100 mg 3 times a day. there were no
signiﬁcant changes in liver, spleen volume, or hemoglobin
level. mean platelet counts decreased and  xxxg444xxx  level
increased. the authors suggested that  xxxd2645xxx  monotherapy
might not be sufﬁcient to maintain the same control of disease
in all patients (elstein et al 2002; zimran and elstein 2003).
in 2005, pastores et al (2005) undertook a 2-year open
label study and enrolled 10 adults who received 100 mg
 xxxd2645xxx  3 times a day. seven out of 10 patients completed the 2-year study.  xxxg444xxx  levels decreased by
25.4% over 2 years (table 1). at 18 months, spleen volume
decreased by 24.3%, liver volume by 15.1%. hematological
parameters such as the platelet count improved over 2-year
period. this study conﬁrmed the ﬁndings of elstein et al
(2004) that adverse effects such as diarrhea, abdominal pain,
distension, weight loss tremors, and paresthesia decrease over
the course of the trial. it also produced similar beneﬁcial
effects to those reported by cox et al (2000).
in 2007, elstein et al (2007) reported the results of a
2-year open label trial in which 36 clinically stable patients
on enzyme replacement therapy were enrolled and the effects
of combined enzyme and  xxxd2645xxx  therapy compared with
 xxxd2645xxx  monotherapy. this was an extension of the previously reported 6-month clinical trial, elstein et al (2002).
 xxxd2645xxx  was well tolerated by both groups, and the safety
proﬁle was consistent with the previous trials. they suggested
that  xxxd2645xxx  could be an effective maintenance therapy in
stabilized patients with type 1 gaucher.
departing from previous clinical trials with their focus on
hematologic markers, and liver and spleen volumes, pastores
et al (2007) evaluated the effects of  xxxd2645xxx  on bone manifestations and bone mineral density. they recruited 72 patients
with type i gaucher disease, who had previously participated
in 3 multinational, open-label clinical trials of  xxxd2645xxx . the
data were collected prospectively over an observation period
of 2 years. at study entry, osteoporosis (68%) and bone pain
(63%) were the most common bone-related ﬁndings. they
showed that 83% of the patients reported no bone pain and
bmd z-scores were improved from baseline at both the
lumbar spine and femoral neck at each time point (months 6,
12, and 24). the authors suggested that the beneﬁcial effect of
 xxxd2645xxx  on bone symptoms might be explained by its wide
tissue distribution and by a direct effect on bone cells.
in 2007, giraldo et al (2006) reported the results of
an open label 12-month study. twenty-ﬁve patients (10
therapy naïve, 15 previously treated with ert) with mild to
moderate gaucher disease type 1 were treated with  xxxd2645xxx .

 xxxd2645xxx  and gaucher disease

at 6 months, the previously untreated group showed a
mean increase in hemoglobin of 0.77 g/dl, platelet count
of 41.5 × 109/l or remained stable, and a mean decrease in
their  xxxg444xxx  levels of 38.2% (table 1). their results
were similar to those treated with ert only. they concluded
that the efﬁcacy of  xxxd2645xxx  therapy after 6 months was
comparable to that of ert.

adverse reactions/safety/
precautions
gastrointestinal symptoms
diarrhea and weight loss were common in the clinical studies
(13, 15, 18, 20, 23, 24). diarrhea is probably due to inhibition
of disaccharidase activity by  xxxd2645xxx  in the intestine that
results in osmotic diarrhea. diarrhea was noted to improve
over time whether or not the dose of  xxxd2645xxx  was decreased.
some patients were treated with anti-diarrheal medications
such as loperamide. the cause of weight loss is unknown.
the incidence of weight loss was more common in the ﬁrst
12 months of treatment and most of patients recovered from
the weight loss by 24 months of treatment.

neurological symptoms
tremor was reported in about 30% of patients (cox et al 2003).
it was more common within the ﬁrst month of treatment and
improved between 1 to 3 months during treatment and resolved
spontaneously, or after reduction of dose or discontinuation of
 xxxd2645xxx . parasthesias and burning sensation due to peripheral neuropathy were reported in 15%–20% of patients, and
resolved after the discontinuation of the medication or dose
reduction (cox et al 2000; pastores et al 2005). cognitive
dysfunction was reported in 5 patients, but no causal relationship was found (elstein et al 2005). baseline and repeat
neurological evaluations at about 6-month intervals are recommended for all patients who will be treated with  xxxd2645xxx .

reproduction toxicity/pregnancy/
breast feeding
animal studies showed that  xxxd2645xxx  adversely affects
spermatogenesis and sperm parameters and reduces fertility (walden et al 2006). in contrast to the observations in
mice, the recently published study showed that  xxxd2645xxx 
has no apparent effect on spermatogenesis in man (amory
et al 2007).
reproductive effects in females could be increased postimplantation loss and early embryonic death, and dystocia.
it is not clear if these toxic effects will be reversible after
long-term treatment. animal studies showed that  xxxd2645xxx 

therapeutics and clinical risk management 2008:4(2)

could cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant
animal.  xxxd2645xxx  is contraindicated in women who are or
may become pregnant. male patients are recommended to
use a contraceptive method while taking  xxxd2645xxx , and for
3 months after its discontinuation.
it is unknown if  xxxd2645xxx  is excreted in human milk.
because of potential serious adverse reactions of  xxxd2645xxx  in
nursing infants, it should not be used in nursing mothers.

conclusion
 xxxd2645xxx  is an oral medication that inhibits glucosylceremide
synthase (substrate reduction therapy) and may partially
increase glucocerebrosidase enzyme activity (chaperone
mediated therapy). studies showed that  xxxd2645xxx  did
improve the biochemical outcomes of patients with mild to
moderate type 1 gaucher during clinical trials ranging from
6 to 36 months, but there is insufﬁcient evidence to show if
treatment will maintain both clinical and biochemical effects
over a long-term period, or on its efﬁciency in treating the
bones and preventing serious aspects such as pulmonary
hypertension.
bone manifestations are considered among the most
painful and debilitating components of type i gaucher.
ert can improve the bone symptoms but it takes much
longer to achieve satisfactory results (charrow et al 2007).
however, recently published data shows that  xxxd2645xxx  may
well improve bone density and prevent bone crisis (pastores
et al 2007). long-term studies are needed to support this
ﬁnding.
while some splenectomized patients participated in the
clinical trials, no studies have yet evaluated the impact of
splenectomy on the effectiveness of  xxxd2645xxx . splenectomy is thought to impact adversely the severity of bone
disease.
currently,  xxxd2645xxx  has limited indication for use in
only adults with mild, moderate type i gaucher disease in
the usa and europe, due to lack of information about the
beneﬁcial effects on severe cases (cox et al 2003). potential
advantages of  xxxd2645xxx  should be carefully weighed in individual patients, and the treatment decision should be made by
physicians with expertise in gaucher disease. patients with
some residual enzyme activity and mild symptoms of type i
gaucher disease can be treated with  xxxd2645xxx  if ert is not
an option. it is essential to monitor the disease progression
by checking levels of hemoglobin, platelets,  xxxg444xxx 
every 3–6 months and liver and spleen volumes and bone
studies including dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa)
scan and bone mri once a year.

the adverse effects such as weight loss, diarrhea, and
tremors are dose related and reversible, but close neurologic
follow up is recommended due to possible complications such
as peripheral neuropathy and cognitive decline. none of the
authors discussed how much the adverse effects interfered
with the patients’ daily activities of living.
the potential long-term neurologic adverse effects of
 xxxd2645xxx  are difﬁcult to assess from available studies. there
seems to be a direct association between using  xxxd2645xxx  and
developing tremors. the cause of peripheral neuropathy was
attributed to vitamin b12 deﬁciency in some patients but
the use of  xxxd2645xxx  was not totally excluded as a cause of
peripheral neuropathy. patients who were on  xxxd2645xxx  did
perform signiﬁcantly poorer than patients who were not on
 xxxd2645xxx  on tests measuring verbal learning and memory on
psychologist administrated tests, but this difference between
two groups was not observed in computer assessed tests
(elstein et al 2005). it is not clear if patients on  xxxd2645xxx  are
at greater risk for verbal and memory difﬁculties.
none of the studies addresses cardiac and pulmonary
status especially regarding pulmonary hypertension, and
quality of life.
additional controlled longitudinal studies are needed to be
undertaken with a larger number of patients not only to determine the biochemical but also clinical long term outcomes of
patients with type i gaucher disease on  xxxd2645xxx  therapy.
