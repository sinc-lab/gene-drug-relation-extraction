1 the effects of two reversible, predominantly  xxxg1357xxx -a (mao-a)
inhibitors, moclobemide (150 mg three times daily) and toloxatone (400-200-400 mg
day-1) on monoamine metabolites and psychometric performance were compared in a
double-blind placebo controlled crossover study in 12 healthy subjects.
2 after 7 days of moclobemide/toloxatone/placebo administration subjects were
hospitalized for 24 h on day 8. blood samples were drawn every 2 h for determination of
plasma noradrenaline (na), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol ( xxxd2178xxx ), homovanillic acid
(hva) and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-hiaa). urine was collected for measurements
of normetanephrine and 3-methoxytyramine excretion. psychometric performance
(short- and long-term memory, critical flicker fusion frequency, choice reaction time) and
subjective feelings were assessed before each drug intake (in the morning, at noon, in the

evening).
3 compared with placebo, both reversible  xxxg1357xxx  inhibitors decreased the
plasma concentration of  xxxd2178xxx  and hva. the overall fall in  xxxd2178xxx  (auc from 0 to 24
h) was 44% during moclobemide and 12% during toloxatone (p < 0.001) and the overall
decrease in hva was 38% and 20% (p < 0.005) on moclobemide and toloxatone,
respectively.
4 before the next drug intake, mao-a inhibition, as judged by the decrease of plasma
 xxxd2178xxx  concentration, was significantly different from placebo with moclobemide but not
with toloxatone.
5 moclobemide, but not toloxatone, exerted a moderate, but significant inhibition of
the deamination of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) as judged by the fall in plasma 5-hiaa
concentration. neither drug influenced plasma na concentration.
6 a significant rise in urinary excretion of normetanephrine was observed on moclobemide and to a lesser extent on toloxatone. the urinary excretion of 3-methoxytyramine
was significantly raised by moclobemide but not by toloxatone.
7 neither moclobemide nor toloxatone altered memory function, vigilance, subjective
feelings or sleep characteristics of the subjects.

introduction

 xxxg1357xxx  (mao) is present in two
forms: mao-a and mao-b. they differ in
substrate specificity: mao-a preferentially
deaminates noradrenaline, adrenaline, normetanephrine, serotonin, tyramine and
dopamine and it is selectively inhibited by
 xxxd1730xxx ; mao-b metabolises phenylethylamine,  xxxd314xxx , tyramine and dopamine
and its selective inhibitor is selegiline. most of
the classical  xxxg1357xxx  inhibitors
(maois) in clinical use inhibit both forms of
mao, and in an irreversible manner.
maois were widely used as antidepressants
until enthusiasm waned because of life-threatening hypertensive crises set off by ingestion of
tyramine-containing foods while patients were
taking maois.
in the last few years interest in maois has
again increased since their efficacy is no longer
doubted and it seems that the frequency and
gravity of their adverse effects especially the
'cheese reaction' have been overestimated (bass
& kervin, 1989; sullivan & shulmann, 1984).
moreover, recent research has been directed to
develop new maois which block the mao in a
selective and reversible manner and with a
shorter duration of action.
toloxatone is the only reversible and selective
mao-a inhibitor available for clinical use. it
has been marketed in france since 1985.
moclobemide is a new, reversible (waldmeier,
1985) mao-a selective (koulu et al., 1989;
wiesel et al., 1985) maoi with few adverse
effects and clear antidepressant properties
(casacchia et al., 1984; dajas et al., 1984; larsen
et al., 1984; stabl et al., 1989). moclobemide
penetrates well the brain, maximal concentrations
of moclobemide in csf are reached 2 h after oral
administration and high csf/plasma ratio (0.5)
can be obtained (lauy et al., 1990). non-selective
maois interact with tyramine to raise blood
pressure but this interaction is negligible with

of both maois, throughout a period of 24 h. in
addition, we investigated the effect of these two
reversible and predominantly mao-a inhibiting agents on vigilance, memory functions,
subjective feelings and subjective characteristics
of sleep in healthy subjects.
methods

subjects
twelve healthy male volunteers were selected
for the study. their age ranged from 20 to 29
years (mean 23.9), their weight from 58 to 77 kg
(mean 67.7) and height from 168 to 186 cm
(mean 178). subjects had no previous history of
cardiovascular, pulmonary, psychiatric, or other
diseases, and had been free of medication for at
least 1 month. every subject had a normal 12
lead ecg and normal results following clinical,
biochemical and haematological examinations
before the study. all of the subjects had normal
results on three psychological examinations
(minnesota multiphasic personality inventory,
eysenck personality inventory and cattell
anxiety test). approval was obtained from the
ethics committee of the pitid-salpetri6re
hospital and each subject gave written informed
consent before the study.

dietary restrictions subjects were asked not to
eat tyramine-containing foods during the 5
weeks of the study. a dietary card was given to
each subject and the importance of avoiding
tyramine-containing foodstuffs and other drugs
than study medications was emphasized. alcohol
consumption was prohibited during the three
treatment periods. subjects were asked not to
drink caffeine containing beverages, and not to
eat chocolate during the 24 h prior to and during
study days. during hospitalization (day 8) meals
were standardized and only water and milk were
authorized as beverages.

moclobemide (berlin et al., 1989; korn et al.,
1988).

study design and dosage regimen

the present study was carried out in order to
assess and compare the effect of 1 week administration of moclobemide and toloxatone on biochemical parameters that are considered to
reflect monoamine metabolism. we therefore
evaluated the kinetics of mao inhibition at steady
state, during administration of therapeutic doses

this was a double-blind crossover study. drugs
were administered according to a balanced latin
square design. each treatment period was
separated by 1 week of wash out. treatments
were given throughout 8 days three times per
day. subjects took two capsules in the morning,

comparison of mao-a inhibition by moclobemide and toloxatone
capsule at noon and two capsules in the
evening 10 min after meals. the dose of
moclobemide was 150 mg three times daily, the
dose of toloxatone was 1000 mg day-1 (400 mg
in the morning, 200 mg at noon and 400 mg in
the evening). as the capsules of toloxatone are
200 mg, one capsule of placebo was given with
the morning and evening doses of moclobemide,
respectively. all medications were administered
in identical nonidentifiable capsules. treatments
were supplied by produits roche (france).
the dose of toloxatone administered in this
study (1000 mg day-) is the highest dose used
in therapeutics. the dose of moclobemide (450
mg day1) is the mean daily dose used in most
clinical studies (stabl et al., 1989).
one

study outline
subjects began to take their treatment at home.
on day 3 they underwent a clinical examination
and they reported the adverse effects (if any)
observed. on day 8 in the morning subjects
arrived after an overnight fast at the department.
a polyethylene cannula was inserted into a
forearm vein. the contralateral arm was used
for blood pressure and heart rate measurements.
the first blood sample and blood pressure and
heart rate recording were taken at least 20 min
after the insertion of the cannula, the subjects
being in the supine position. during this time,
the subjects filled a questionnaire concerning
the subjective characteristics of sleep. the
subjects took their standardised breakfast after
the first blood sample was drawn. the first
psychometric assessment (to) started after the
breakfast. at the end of this assessment, subjects
were asked to void their bladders and took the
morning dose of the treatment with 150 ml of tap
water. the next psychometric assessment (t1)
started 30 min before the ingestion of the next
dose of treatment, and the third (t2) before the
ingestion of the evening dose. treatments were
administered 6 hourly. blood samples were
drawn every 2 h throughout the day (0, 2, 4, 6,
8, 10, 12, 14, 16 h) and the next day in the
morning before the subjects were discharged
from the department (24 h). at this time a 12
lead ecg was performed and blood was drawn
for routine biochemistry and blood cell count.
urine was collected from 0 to 12 and from 12 to
24h.
assessments
chemical determinations blood for chemical
determinations was collected into silicone

807

coated tubes containing 0.5 ml of 0.129 m
buffered sodium citrate. blood samples were
immediately centrifuged at 40 c and the plasma
frozen. the plasma samples were stored at
-700 c.
assay of s-hiaa, hva and na in plasma
plasma (1 ml) was mixed with 20 ,ul internal
standard (containing 10 ng 5-hydroxyindole-2carboxylic acid and 400 pg 3,4-dihydroxybenzyl xxxd2850xxx ), 20 ili cystein solution and 1.0 ml
0.2 m ammonium acetate buffer ph 6.5. the
mixture was passed through a polypropylene
column (inner diameter 5 mm), filled with biorex 70, sodium form, filling height 2.5 cm, and
then the column rinsed with 2 ml demineralized
water. the column effluate and rinsing solution
were combined and passed through a second
polypropylene column. the column was rinsed
with 3 x5 ml demineralized water, 1 ml methanol
(50% in demineralized water) and 2 ml absolute
methanol. 5-hiaa and hva were eluted with
8 ml 4 m  xxxd2154xxx /methanol solution. 10 ,ul
cystein solution (20 g 1-1) was added to the
 xxxd2154xxx /methanol eluate and 2 ml of this
evaporated to dryness at 400 c in a rotary
evaporator. the residue was dissolved using 0.5
ml of the mobile phase and an aliquot injected
onto the h.p.l.c. system. the mobile phase consisted of 1.4 g naoh, 5.25 g  xxxd1710xxx , 110 mg
1-octane-sulphonic acid (sodium salt) and 100 ml
methanol i-', ph was 4.5. flow rate was 0.4 ml
min-1 and the amperometric detector was set at
+0.80 v vs an ag/agcl reference electrode.
this method was developed and validated in our
laboratory (h-m. thiede) and normal plasma
values agree well with those reported by others

(ortiz etal., 1988; sagara etal., 1988). intra- and
interassay variance was below 10%.
noradrenaline, retained from plasma by the
first cation exchanger column, was eluted from
the column with 5 ml 2 m nacl solution after
three times washings with 5 ml demineralized
water. 50 pul sodium disulphite solution (50 g 1-1),
1.0 ml 2 m tris acetate buffer ph 8.6 and 20 mg
acid-washed aluminium oxide were added to the
column eluate. this mixture was stirred for 15
min, the supernatant was removed, and the
aluminium oxide was washed three times with
demineralized water. after the last washing
noradrenaline was eluted from the aluminium
oxide by adding 150 p.l 0.1 m perchloric acid.
90 pul of the perchloric acid extract was injected
onto the h.p.l.c. system. intra- and interassay
variance was below 5%. the mobile phase used
in this system was the same as described for
hva and 5-hiaa. sample cleanup was made
according to jackman et al. (1984).

assay of  xxxd2178xxx  in plasma to 1 ml of plasma
were added 50 ri internal standard (containing
2 ng at-methyl-noradrenaline), 1.0 ml demineralized water, 50 ri sodium disulphite (10
g l-1), 20 mg acid-washed aluminium oxide and
250 ri 2 m tris acetate buffer ph 8.6. upon
addition of tris, the plasma samples were mixed
for 15 min. after the aluminium oxide was
allowed to settle and the supernatant was discarded. the aluminium oxide was then washed
with three 8 ml portions of demineralized water.
 xxxd2178xxx  was eluted from aluminium oxide with
250 pi of mobile phase which consisted of 9.66
,ug sodium dihydrogenphosphate x h20, 10 ml
methanol, 100 mg 1-octane-sulphonic acid
(sodium salt), 37 mg edta and 8.5 ml 2 m
phosphoric acid 1-1. up to 100 pli was injected
onto the h.p.l.c. system. flow was 0.8 ml min-1.
for detection an esa coulometric detector
(esa inc., bedford, ma) was used (coulochem
model 5100 a) with a guard cell 5020 and a high
sensitivity analytical cell 5011. the guard cell
potential was +0.50 v, the working electrode
potentials were +0.35 v and -0.35 v, respectively. the sample cleanup was done according
to a modified version of eriksson & persson
(1987). intra- and interassay variance was about
5%.
assay of total normetanephrine and 3-methoxytyramine in urine urine (0.1 ml) was mixed
with 0.1 ml internal standard solution (containing
20 ng 3-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzylamine) and
0.2 ml 0.2 m perchloric acid. the acid diluted
urine samples were then hydrolysed in glass
stoppered tubes in a water bath at 950 c for 30
min. after hydrolysis samples were ph adjusted
to ph 6.5 with ammonium hydroxide and passed
through a cation exchanger column. the column
was rinsed with demineralized water, 4 ml
methanol and o-methylated catecholamines
were eluted with 2.5 ml 2 m ammonium
hydroxide in methanol. the eluate was
evaporated to dryness at 450 c in a rotary
evaporator and the residue dissolved with
mobile phase as described by shoup & kissinger
(1977). an aliquot was injected onto the h.p.l.c.
system. inter- and intraassay variance was below
5%.
heart rate and blood pressure measurements
heart rate (hr) and blood pressure (bp) were
recorded in supine position after 15 min of
bedrest, and in standing position after 2 min of
standing by an oscillometric automated bp and
hr recorder (dinamap 1846, critikon, tampa,
fl). hr and bp were measured before ingestion of the morning dose (to) and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,
12 and 24 h thereafter.

psychometric evaluations a) critical flicker
fusion frequency (hindmarch, 1980) was
measured using the leeds psychomotor tester
(zak gmbh, d-8346 simbach/inn, frg).
threshold frequency was taken as the mean of
three ascending and three descending readings.
all measurements were carried out at a viewing
distance of 1 m in a room with constant subdued
artificial lighting, after allowing sufficient time
for subjects to adapt to the light.
b) choice reaction time was also measured by
the leeds psychomotor tester. total reaction
time, recognition time and motor reaction time
were determined. the measure given in
milliseconds was the mean of 50 stimulus
presentations.
c) the digit symbol substitution test is a subtest of the wechsler adult intelligence schedule
involving coding skills. parallel forms of the test
were used in order to control any memorizing or
learning which could interfere with the performance assessment (hindmarch, 1980). the
score was the number of items completed
correctly in 3 min.
d) the coupled word test uses paired-associate
words to evaluate short-term memory. twelve
pairs of words were read to the subjects. recall
was checked immediately after presentation.
e) the picture test was used as a measure of longterm memory. a set of 20 simple pictures was
used. free recall and recognition were assessed
after 30 min delay.
f) visual analogue rating scales (vas) were
used to assess subjective feelings. the subjects
were asked to rate their current feelings by
marking the appropriate place on a 100 mm line
which had a central area corresponding to a
normal state. these vas contained the following items: anxious, tired, happy, relaxed, drowsy,
dizzy, clumsy, alert, energetic, sad and depressed.
sleep characteristics were evaluated by a structured questionnaire.
adverse effects were recorded by free interviews
on day 3 and day 8.
statistical analysis

analysis of the plasma concentrations and urinary
excretion for each variable the area under the
plasma concentration-time curve (auc) was
determined by trapezoidal rule from to to the
last concentrations measured (t24 h). in addition,
plasma concentrations just before drug intake
(to, t6 h, t12 h and t24 h) and minimal plasma
concentrations between the first and second,
and second and third drug intake were analysed.
the statistical analysis was performed using an
anova for repeated measurements with

comparison of mao-a inhibition by moclobemide and toloxatone
factors subject, time, period and treatment.
urinary parameters were also tested by
analysis of variance using as factors subject,
period and treatment.
if a significant treatment effect occurred,
treatments were compared by the tukey test
(winer, 1971; zar, 1984).
analysis of psychometric results an anova
was performed on the to values with factors
subject, period and treatment. assessments of
ti and t2 were tested by an anova including
factors subject, time, period, treatment. the
anova was followed by the tukey test if
indicated.
nominal scale data were tested by the
mcnemar's test (zar, 1984).
the statistical analyses were performed by the
statistical package  xxxg22xxx  ( xxxg22xxx , statistical
software, inc., los angeles, california). data
are presented as mean ± s.e. mean. a p value
< 0.05 was considered significant.

excluded, the subject was replaced. the results
of this subject were not included in the analysis
of data.

subjective adverse effects table 1 shows
adverse effects reported on day 8. there was no
difference in adverse effects reported on day 3
and day 8. more subjects reported one or more
symptoms during active treatment (toloxatone
vs placebo p < 0.05, moclobemide vs placebo p
< 0.025) but there was no difference with regard
to adverse effects between toloxatone and
moclobemide.
heart rate and blood pressure no modification
of systolic and diastolic bp was found. no subject had orthostatic hypotension and there was
no statistically significant difference between
supine and standing bp. a significant treatment
effect occurred for supine and standing heart
rate (figure 1) but further analysis could not
differentiate between the treatments. mean
standing heart rate seemed to be lower on
moclobemide than on toloxatone or placebo but
this difference was statistically not significant
(tukey test: q = 1.503, ns).

adverse effects
drop out from the initially included 12
subjects one subject was excluded from the
study after the first treatment period which was
found to be with toloxatone. this subject had
electrocardiographical changes (t wave inversion in leads ii, iii, avf and v4-6) without
subjective symptoms. no abnormalities were
found concerning the plasma adrenaline, na,
 xxxd2178xxx , hva and 5-hiaa concentrations.
since a toxic effect of the drug could not be

plasma concentrations of  xxxd2178xxx , hva,
5-hiaa and noradrenaline (table 2 and figure
2) both reversible maois significantly decreased plasma dhgp concentration as judged
on auc. the overall fall was 44% on moclobemide and 12% on toloxatone (p < 0.001), thus
the decrease in plasma  xxxd2178xxx  concentration
was 3.5 fold greater during moclobemide than
during toloxatone administration. the maximal
decrease in plasma  xxxd2178xxx  concentration was
60% with moclobemide and 29% with toloxatone.

before the next drug intake, plasma  xxxd2178xxx 
concentrations were not different from placebo
while subjects were taking toloxatone. in contrast to toloxatone, moclobemide produced a
constant decrease in plasma  xxxd2178xxx : plasma
 xxxd2178xxx  concentrations before the next drug
intake, even 12 h after the evening dose, were
significantly lower on moclobemide than on
placebo or toloxatone.
areas under the plasma hva concentrationtime curves were significantly smaller during
treatment with the two maqis. compared with
placebo, aucs were 38% smaller on moclobemide and 20% smaller on toloxatone. the
difference between the two active treatments
was significant (p < 0.005). nadir plasma hva
concentrations on toloxatone were not different
from those found on placebo. moclobemide,
compared with placebo, significantly reduced
(-41%) the nadir plasma hva level. plasma
hva concentrations before drug intake were
significantly lower on moclobemide than on
placebo. at t24 h a significant treatment effect
(p = 0.0035) occurred accompanied by a period
x treatment interaction (p = 0.0024) which
invalidated the analysis of this time point.

plasma 5-hiaa concentrations varied much
throughout the day. the rises in 5-hiaa concentration appeared mostly after meals.
toloxatone did not affect at all plasma 5-hiaa
levels. auc and nadir plasma 5-hiaa concentrations on moclobemide were significantly
lower than those observed on toloxatone.
the two maois did not affect the plasma
concentration of noradrenaline.
intratreatment comparisons were done to find
out whether plasma concentrations at to and
t24 h were identical or not. this analysis showed
that on placebo plasma  xxxd2178xxx , hva and 5hiaa concentrations were significantly higher
at to than at t24 h (p = 0.04, 0.0023 and 0.0024,
respectively). moclobemide completely blocked
this increase at to of plasma  xxxd2178xxx , hva and
5-hiaa since on moclobemide there was no
difference between concentrations of to and
t24 h. toloxatone inhibited the increase at to of
plasma  xxxd2178xxx  and hva but did not affect that
of 5-hiaa.

urinary excretion of normetanephrine and 3methoxytyramine moclobemide significantly
increased urinary excretion of normetanephrine
compared both to placebo and toloxatone
(figure 3). during the day (from 0 to 12 h)
toloxatone did not rise urinary excretion of
normetanephrine but it increased excretion of

this metabolite of noradrenaline during the night
(fraction from 12 to 24 h).
urinary excretion of 3-methoxytyramine was
increased only by moclobemide and then only
during the night.
there was a great inter- and intraindividual
variability on placebo for urinary excretion of
both monoamine metabolites and there was no
significant difference between the fractions of 0
to 12 h and of 12 to 24 h.

psychometric evaluations (table 3)

vigilance no treatment effect was observed on
critical flicker fusion frequency or digit substitution symbol test. total reaction time and
motor reaction time were not modified by the
treatments. a treatment effect was observed for
recognition time (p = 0.0079) at to. further
analysis showed that recognition time was
shorter on moclobemide than on placebo or
toloxatone. this difference although statistically
significant may be clinically irrelevant.

memory tasks neither moclobemide nor
toloxatone affected short-term or long-term
memory in these healthy subjects.
vas were not modified by the two maois
nor was the quality of sleep changed. the
maois did not shorten or prolong sleeping time

discussion
the main objective of this study was the comparison of the mao-a inhibiting properties of
moclobemide, toloxatone and placebo after
long-term administration in healthy subjects.
secondary objectives included evaluation of
tolerance and assessment of psychometric performance, subjective feelings and sleep
characteristics in order to find out whether these
reversible maois impair different psychological
functions.
both reversible maois significantly inhibited
the deamination of noradrenaline and dopamine.
both drugs decreased plasma  xxxd2178xxx  and hva
concentrations, increased urinary excretion of
normetanephrine. the effect of moclobemide
on these parameters, which reflect mao inhibition (waldmeier, 1985; wiesel et al., 1985) was
more pronounced than that of toloxatone. the
overall fall in plasma  xxxd2178xxx  was 3.5 fold greater
and the overall diminution in plasma hva 1.3
fold greater on moclobemide than on toloxatone.
urinary excretion of normetanephrine and 3methoxytyramine was more than twofold greater
on moclobemide than on toloxatone. the
maximal mao inhibiting effect (nadir plasma
concentrations of monoamine metabolites) of
moclobemide was more important than that of
toloxatone. furthermore, while the mao
inhibiting effect of toloxatone did not last until
the next drug intake (6 h later), moclobemide
lead to a mao inhibition throughout the day.
there were some differences in the plasma
 xxxd2178xxx  and hva responses to these reversible
maois. mao inhibition as reflected by plasma
hva levels showed a prolonged, constant
blockage put plasma  xxxd2178xxx  mirrored more
rapid changes especially evident with toloxatone.
plasma turnover of  xxxd2178xxx  is faster than that of
hva (eisenhofer et al., 1989; elchisak et al.,
1982) and therefore decrease in mao inhibition
(increase in  xxxd2178xxx ) is reflected more rapidly in
plasma  xxxd2178xxx  than in plasma hva concentration. therefore plasma  xxxd2178xxx  may be a more
rapid and perhaps more sensitive indicator of
mao-a inhibition than plasma hva concentration.
plasma 5-hiaa concentrations varied
considerably. this may be the result of dietary
non-compliance. however, the effect of
moclobemide on the deamination of 5-ht is

known to be moderate (koulu et al., 1989)
probably because the affinity of the drug to the
binding sites of the mao is less than that of
serotonin.
intratreatment comparisons of plasma monoamine metabolites showed that on placebo to
values were significantly higher than t24 h
values. to blood samples were drawn 30 min
after subjects arrived at the department while
the t24 h samples were drawn next morning
when subjects were still in the resting position.
thus, to values represent usual, every day life
conditions and t24 h values experimental conditions. these different experimental conditions
might result in the morning elevation of plasma
monoamine metabolites when subjects were
arriving and were taking placebo. this morning
elevation observed only at to was completely
abolished by moclobemide and to a lesser extent
by toloxatone.
the subjects tolerated well both maois,
however, more subjects reported adverse effects
on active treatment than on placebo. no adverse
effect was reported by more than two subjects
and neither drug caused orthostatic hypotension.
the presence of epigastric pain in two subjects
on moclobemide was somewhat surprising.
stomach pain or epigastric discomfort have been
reported with a frequency of 2.3% in double
blind (n = 1262) and 1.9% in open trials (n =
941) with moclobemide. this drug induced
incidence was never significantly different from
that observed with placebo (roche, unpublished
data). it seems, however, that reversible
maois are well tolerated by healthy subjects
(berlin et al., 1989; grind et al., 1986; wijnands

et al., 1989).
an overall drug effect occurred for both
supine and standing heart rate but no difference
could be demonstrated between the active treatments. in clinical studies moclobemide has been
found not to modify heart rate and it seems to
be devoid of anticholinergic properties (berlin
et al., 1990).
the reversible maois used in this study, did
not impair either vigilance or memory tasks.
impairment of psychomotor function on antidepressant drugs other than maois is very well
documented (hindmarch, 1980, 1988;
hindmarch & subhan, 1986). doses given in
therapeutics and administered to healthy
subjects lead to substantial deterioration of
vigilance and/or memory functions (bye et al.,
1978; curran et al., 1986; seppala & linnoila,
1983). in the present study, both maois were
given in therapeutic doses and no impairment in
psychometric performance and memory occurred.
mao inhibition per se seems not to affect

comparison of mao-a inhibition by moclobemide and toloxatone
psychometric tests since during the psychometric assessments mao inhibition was the
lowest on toloxatone and not different from
other time points on moclobemide.
this new class of maois which inhibit the
enzyme in a reversible and selective manner,
show negligible interaction with tyramine
(berlin et al., 1989; bieck et al., 1989) and the
risk of hypertensive reaction therefore may be
less. drugs in this class (brofaromine, moclobemide, amiflamine, toloxatone) have a short
duration of action (mann et al., 1984). however,
the question may arise whether these reversible,
short-acting maois possess clinical efficacy. it
has been postulated that greater than 80% mao
inhibition is necessary to rise intracellular concentration of neurotransmitter amines and to
lead to clinical efficacy (mcdaniel, 1986).

clinical studies have shown that moclobemide is
superior to placebo (casacchia et al., 1984) and
is as effective as clomipramine (larsen et al.,
1984) and amitriptyline (norman et al., 1985) in
treating depressive patients. this indicates that
the mao inhibiting effect of moclobemide is
sufficient to elicit clinical improvement at a dose
used in the present study. however, this mean
therapeutic dose exerted a 44% inhibition of the
deamination of noradrenaline. therefore it
seems that a 40-50% mao inhibition is sufficient
to lead to improvement of clinical symptoms.
further clinical studies are needed to establish a
correlation between the evolution of clinical
symptoms and biochemical parameters reflecting mao inhibition and find an eventual mao
inhibition threshold which would be necessary
to obtain to have a clinical efficacy.
