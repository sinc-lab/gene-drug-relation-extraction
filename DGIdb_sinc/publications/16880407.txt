we have demonstrated that cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (tslp), whose expression is rapidly induced upon keratinocyteselective ablation of retinoid x receptors (rxrs) -␣ and -␤ in the
mouse (rxr␣␤epⴚ/ⴚ mice), plays a key role in initiating a skin and
systemic atopic dermatitis-like phenotype. we show here that
topical application of the physiologically active ligand [1␣,25(oh)2d3; calcitriol] of the  xxxg2412xxx , or of its low-calcemic
analog mc903 (calcipotriol; dovonex), induces tslp expression in
epidermal keratinocytes, which results in an atopic dermatitis-like
syndrome mimicking that seen in rxr␣␤epⴚ/ⴚ mutants and transgenic mice overexpressing tslp in keratinocytes. furthermore,
topical application of  xxxd3417xxx  receptor rar␥-selective agonist
bms961 also induces tslp expression either on its own or synergistically with 1␣, xxxd408xxx . our data demonstrate that rxr兾
 xxxg2412xxx  and rxr兾retinoic acid receptor-␥ heterodimers
and their ligands cell-autonomously control the expression of tslp
in epidermal keratinocytes of the mouse. we propose molecular
mechanisms through which  xxxd1682xxx  and  xxxd3417xxx  signalings
could be involved in the pathogenesis of atopic diseases.

uclear receptors (nrs) belong to a superfamily of liganddependent transcriptional regulators (1, 2). within this
superfamily, retinoid x receptors (rxrs) -␣, -␤, and -␥ play a
key role through heterodimerization with some 15 nr partners,
e.g.,  xxxd3417xxx  receptors (rars),  xxxg2412xxx  (vdr),
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, and liver x receptors (1, 2). we reported (3) that selective ablation of rxr␣
and rxr ␤ in adult mouse epidermal keratinocytes
(rxr␣␤ep⫺/⫺ mice) triggers a skin and systemic syndrome
similar to human atopic dermatitis (ad), a chronic skin inflammatory disease with a strong genetic component that affects
children (10–20%) and adults (1–3%) (4). these mice exhibit the
major features of the human ad syndrome that include (i) skin
eczematous-like lesions with xerosis and pruritus, associated
with a skin inflammatory infiltrate mainly composed of cd4⫹ t
helper (th) type 2 cells, dendritic cells, eosinophils, and mast
cells and (ii) systemic abnormalities, including elevated serum
ige and igg levels and blood and tissue eosinophilia.
we found that expression of the cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (tslp), known to be produced in epidermal keratinocytes of ad patients (5), is rapidly induced in keratinocytes of
rxr␣␤ep⫺/⫺ mice. furthermore, we showed that k14-tslp transgenic mice overexpressing tslp in keratinocytes exhibit an adlike phenotype similar to that of rxr␣␤ep⫺/⫺ mice (3), demonstrating that tslp can act as an initiating cytokine at the top of a
chain of immunological events that lead to an ad-like phenotype,
in keeping with other recent studies on mouse models of human
allergic inflammatory diseases (asthma and ad) (6–9).
we suggested that up-regulation of keratinocytic tslp expression upon rxr␣ and -␤ ablation could be due to the relief of a
transcriptional repression mediated by rxr兾nr heterodimers (3).

results
topical application of 1␣, xxxd408xxx  or its low-calcemic analog
mc903 activates tslp expression in epidermal keratinocytes. be-

cause rxr兾nr heterodimers in which an agonistic ligand is not
bound to the nr partner can act as transcriptional repressors (10),
we examined whether tslp expression could be induced by nr
agonists. four nanomoles of ligands were topically applied to whole
ears of wt mice for 4 consecutive days (days 1–4), and tslp rna
levels were determined on day 5. application of 1␣, xxxd408xxx 
(the physiologically active  xxxd1682xxx ) led to a dramatic increase
(⬎300-fold) in tslp transcripts at day 5, whereas they were
modestly but significantly increased (5-fold) upon application of a
rar␥-selective agonist (bms961) (11) (fig. 1a). in contrast,
agonists for rxrs (bms649), proliferator-activated receptor
(ppar)␣ ( xxxd2096xxx ), ppar␤ (gw501516), ppar␥ (rosiglitazone), and liver x-activated receptors (25-hydroxycholesterol) had
no effect on tslp expression (fig. 1a).
because, at this dose, 1␣, xxxd408xxx  application resulted in
hypercalcemia and death of the mice, we applied its analog mc903
(calcipotriol; dovonex) (12) that exhibits a low-calcemic activity
and is used for psoriasis treatment (13). mc903 and ethanol
(vehicle) were applied to wt mouse right and left ears, respectively.
two shaved areas (1 cm2 each) of dorsal skin were also treated with
mc903 or ethanol. one day after the first application (day 2), tslp
rna levels were increased in right ears and further increased on
days 3 and 4, whereas no increase occurred in left ears (fig. 1b left).
transcripts of cyp24a1, a 1␣, xxxd408xxx -inducible gene (14),
were increased upon mc903 application, as expected (fig. 1b,
right). tslp rna was also increased in mc903-treated dorsal skin
(fig. 1c), and serum tslp levels were increased at days 2–4,
whereas undetectable at day 0 (before treatment) (fig. 1d). increasing doses of mc903 (0.4, 1, or 4 nmol per ear) led to a
dose-dependent increase of tslp transcripts, which was similarly
observed with other low-calcemic analogs of 1␣, xxxd408xxx , including  xxxd3192xxx  and  xxxd2479xxx  (12, 15) (data not shown).
to examine whether mc903-induced expression of tslp was
skin-restricted, various other organs were analyzed at day 5. no
increase in tslp transcripts was observed in these organs (fig. 1e).
immunohistochemistry (ihc) did not reveal tslp expression in
epidermis or dermis of  xxxd102xxx treated ear and dorsal skin, whereas
it was readily detected at day 4 upon mc903 treatment (fig. 1f; ear
skin, upper; dorsal skin, lower). double ihc for tslp and keratin
1 (k1), a suprabasal keratinocyte marker, showed that tslp was

mainly located in these keratinocytes of both mc903-treated ear
and dorsal skin, whereas it could also be detected at a lower level
in basal keratinocytes (expressing keratin 14) (fig. 1f, and data not
shown).
topical application of mc903 triggers an ad-like syndrome. because

tslp expression appears to be critically involved in the initiation of
ad-like dermatitis in the mouse (3, 8), we investigated whether a
mc903 long-term treatment could induce an ad-like phenotype.
mc903 (4 nmol) was applied daily for 16 days to ears of wt mice.
no hypercalcemia or overall health impairment and weight loss was
observed. ethanol application did not cause any change in ear
appearance, whereas reddening and swelling that worsened with
time were observed from day 5 on mc903-treated ears (data not
shown). at day 17, these ears were red, scaly, swollen, and crusted
(fig. 2, compare a and b), and frequent ear scratching (data not
shown) suggested a pruritus. histological analysis revealed epidermal hyperplasia and a heavy dermal cell infiltrate, in which numerous eosinophils were easily identified upon hematoxylin兾eosinstaining (fig. 2d and inset). their identity was confirmed with
luna’s staining (data not shown). in contrast, no eosinophils were
found in  xxxd102xxx treated ears (fig. 2c). ihc with an anti-gr1
antibody (recognizing granulocytes and monocytes) revealed a
large number of positive cells in dermis, of which eosinophils, but
not neutrophils, were a major component (fig. 2f and data not
shown). numerous t lymphocytes (cd3⫹) were observed in
mc903-treated dermis (fig. 2h), whereas only a few resident t
lymphocytes could be detected in  xxxd102xxx treated ears (fig. 2g).
most of the infiltrated t cells were cd4⫹ helper t cells (fig. 2j),
and only a few cd8⫹ cytotoxic t cells were found (fig. 2l). a large
li et al.

increase in  xxxg1208xxx ⫹ dermal dendritic cells was also observed in
mc903-treated ears (fig. 2 m and n), whereas mast cells were 4-fold
increased in the dermis (fig. 2 o and p and data not shown).
because topical application of 1␣, xxxd408xxx  at a dose of 4 nmol
per ear resulted in mouse death within 7 days, wt mice were thus
treated every other day at a dose of 0.25 nmol per ear, to examine
whether the treatment would result in a skin inflammation similar
to that generated with mc903. at this dose, tslp expression was
significantly induced at day 18, and an inflammatory infiltrate
comprising cd4⫹ t lymphocytes, dendritic cells, eosinophils, and
mast cells could also be observed (data not shown).
taken together, these data indicated that the inflammatory cell
infiltrate observed in skin of mc903- and 1␣, xxxd408xxx -treated
ears had the characteristics of an ad-like skin inflammation (3).
this finding was fully supported by analysis of cytokines expressed
in mc903-treated ears. at day 16, tslp transcripts were markedly
increased (fig. 2q), and th2-type cytokine transcripts (il-4, -5, -13,
-31, -10, and -6) (3) were all significantly increased (fig. 2q).
expression of the th1-type cytokine ifn-␥ was also enhanced,
whereas that of tnf-␤, another th1-type cytokine, was unchanged.
importantly, this cytokine profile, which is essentially that of a
th2-type inflammation, was similar to those observed in skins of
rxr␣␤ep⫺/⫺ and k14-tslp transgenic mice (3), indicating that
the increase of these cytokines was most probably due to enhanced
tslp production in keratinocytes.
systemic abnormalities, including elevated serum ige and igg
levels, associated with blood and tissue eosinophilia, have been
observed in rxr␣␤ep⫺/⫺ and k14-tslp mice, exhibiting similarities to those observed in ad patients (3). serum ige and igg levels
were increased in mice to which mc903 was topically applied for 16

exhibited an increased number of eosinophils in ear-draining lymph
nodes, liver, and spleen (fig. 2s and data not shown). differential
blood cell counts also revealed a marked increase in eosinophils
in mc903-treated mice (693 ⫾ 220 cells per ␮l, versus 204 ⫾ 134
cells per ␮l in  xxxd102xxx treated mice). thus, mc903 topical application leads to a skin and systemic phenotype mimicking that of
human ad.

their control littermates (rxr␣␤ ct) were topically treated with
mc903 (fig. 3f ). as expected (3), selective rxr␣␤ ablation in
keratinocytes of adult mice led to increased tslp expression (lanes
1 and 3). however, the further induction of tslp by mc903 was
severely reduced in rxr␣␤ep⫺/⫺ skin (lanes 2 and 4), indicating an
essential function of keratinocytic rxrs in tslp induction by
vdr agonists, most probably reflecting the involvement of rxr兾
vdr heterodimers.

both keratinocytic vdr and rxr are required for induction of tslp
expression and generation of an ad-like skin inflammation upon
mc903 treatment. to investigate whether the mc903-induced

vdr and rar␥ agonistic ligands synergize to induce skin tslp
expression. although much less potent than that of a vdr agonist,

tslp expression and appearance of an ad-like skin inflammation
were mediated through vdr, mc903 was topically applied on ears
of ‘‘floxed’’ vdr control (ct) mice (vdrl2/l2 mice in which both
vdr alleles bear loxp sites) and of their vdrep⫺/⫺ littermates
[k14-cre(tg/0)兾vdrl2/l2 mice] in which the vdr alleles are selectively ablated in keratinocytes (ref. 16 and our unpublished data).
at day 17 of mc903 treatment, an inflammation was obvious on
ears of vdr ct mice, whereas vdrep⫺/⫺ ears did not show any
sign of inflammation (fig. 3 a and b). accordingly, a massive dermal
infiltrate of inflammatory cells, including eosinophils, cd4⫹ th
cells, dendritic cells, and mast cells was detected in ear sections of
mc903-treated vdr ct (fig. 3c and data not shown) but not in
those of vdrep⫺/⫺ mice (fig. 3d). similarly, no ad-like skin
inflammation was developed upon topical mc903 treatment of
vdr⫺/⫺ (germ-line knockout) mice (17) (data not shown).
tslp expression was strongly induced in mc903-treated skin of
vdr ct mice (fig. 3e, lanes 1 and 2) but not at all in mc903treated skin of vdr⫺/⫺ mice (lanes 5 and 6), whereas it was weakly
increased in mc903-treated skin of vdrep⫺/⫺ mutants (lanes 3 and
4). this latter increase may reflect a faint response to mc903 in
nonkeratinocytic skin cells. in any event, our data clearly demonstrated that induction of tslp expression in keratinocytes upon
mc903 application is a vdr-dependent cell-autonomous event.
to examine whether the effect of mc903 was transduced through
rxr兾vdr heterodimers, ears of rxr␣␤ep⫺/⫺ mice (3) as well as
11738 兩 www.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.0604575103

application of a rar␥-selective agonist (bms961) on mouse ear
skin led to significant increase of tslp transcripts (fig. 1a), and
topical application of  xxxd3417xxx  (ra) resulted in a similar
induction (data not shown). to examine whether vdr and rar␥
agonists could synergize in up-regulating tslp expression, wt
mouse ears were topically treated for 3 days with ethanol, bms961
(4 nmol), a limiting dose of 1␣, xxxd408xxx  (0.4 nmol), or a
combination of the two ligands. ear tslp transcripts and serum
tslp were determined at day 4. a clear synergism was observed
between the effects of bms961 and 1␣, xxxd408xxx  (fig. 4a),
indicating a synergistic involvement of rar- and vdr-mediated
events in transcriptional activation of tslp expression.
tslp production and skin inflammation induced by mc903 are t and
b lymphocyte-independent. as a direct effect of 1␣, xxxd408xxx  on

naı̈ve cd4⫹ t cells may enhance the development of th2 cells (18),
we investigated whether cd4⫹ t cells are required for development
and progression of the active  xxxd1682xxx -induced ad-like phenotype. ethanol or mc903 was applied on ears of rag1⫺/⫺ mice,
which are devoid of mature b and t lymphocytes (19). as observed
in wt mice, keratinocytic tslp expression at day 4 was induced in
mc903-treated, but not in  xxxd102xxx treated, rag1⫺/⫺ mice (see
fig. 6 a, b, and k, which is published as supporting information on
the pnas web site). at day 16, mc903-treated rag1⫺/⫺ mice
exhibited thickened and scaly red ears (fig. 6d), associated with a
dermal cell infiltrate and an epidermal hyperplasia (fig. 6f ),

whereas  xxxd102xxx treated rag1⫺/⫺ ears had a normal appearance
(fig. 6 c and e). as expected, lymphocytes were absent in rag1⫺/⫺
skin sections (data not shown). however, we detected an increased
number of infiltrated eosinophils (fig. 6 f vs. e), mast cells (fig. 6
h vs. g), and dermal dendritic cells (fig. 6 j vs. i) in mc903-treated
rag1⫺/⫺ skin. thus, enhancement of tslp expression and generation of a skin inflammation upon mc903-treatment do not
require the presence of mature b and t lymphocytes.
moreover, whereas transcripts of th2-type cytokines  xxxg1180xxx , -13,
and -31 were not increased in mc903-treated rag1⫺/⫺ skin (as
compared with ethanol treatment), an increase in transcripts of
other th2-type cytokines il-4, -6, and -10 was observed (fig. 6k),
indicating that these cytokines can be produced by nonlymphocytic
cells upon topical mc903 treatment. a marginal increase of ifn-␥
was also observed (fig. 6k). eosinophilia in blood and some tissues
(e.g., ear-associated lymph nodes, liver, and spleen) was also
observed in mc903-treated rag1⫺/⫺ mice (data not shown),
whereas no immunoglobulins could be detected in sera (data not
shown), indicating that increased levels of ige or igg were not
indispensable for generating an ad-like syndrome.
discussion
selective ablation of both rxr␣ and -␤ in mouse skin keratinocytes results in a marked increase of tslp expression that leads to
the development of an ad-like phenotype (3). because (i) putative
nr response elements are present in mouse and human (20) tslp
promoters (see fig. 4 b and c); (ii) tslp repression did not require
li et al.

the af-2 activation function of rxrs; and (iii) tslp induction
could not be triggered by an rxr agonist (fig. 1a), we proposed
(3) that this tslp overexpression could reflect the relief of a
transcriptional repression exerted by nonpermissive rxr兾nr(s)
heterodimers (21) in which the nr partner is unliganded. we
demonstrate here that rxr␣(␤)兾vdr heterodimers are such
heterodimers, because topical treatment of mouse skin with 1␣,25(oh)2d3 or its low-calcemic analogs strongly induces tslp expression in skin keratinocytes and triggers a skin and systemic
ad-like syndrome mimicking that observed in rxr␣␤ep⫺/⫺ mutant and k14-tslp transgenic mice (3). moreover, the induction of
tslp by active  xxxd1682xxx  is a cell-autonomous event, because it
is abolished upon keratinocyte-selective ablation of either vdr or
rxr␣ and -␤. we also show that, although less efficiently than
rxr␣(␤)兾vdr heterodimers, rxr␣(␤)兾rar␥ heterodimers
liganded with ra or the rar␥-selective agonist bms961, also
mediate induction of tslp expression but to a level too low to
trigger, on its own, an overt ad-like phenotype. in keeping with
these data, tslp expression can be induced by 1␣, xxxd408xxx  and
ra in a mouse epithelial tumor cell line ( xxxd4xxx , derived from a
mammary carcinoma) (our unpublished data); tslp was also
shown to be induced by 1␣, xxxd408xxx  in a human epithelial tumor
cell line (scc25, derived from a tongue squamous cell carcinoma)
(20). furthermore, that agonists of vdr and rar␥ could induce
tslp expression either on their own or synergistically indicates that
the corresponding rxr heterodimers bind to distinct cognate
response elements. in this respect, it is noteworthy that both mouse
and human tslp promoter regions contain putative response
elements (fig. 4 b and c) that may bind rxr兾vdr heterodimers
[ xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx  response element (vdre):dr3] or rxr兾rar heterodimers [ra response element (rare):dr2 and dr1] (22).
based on this evidence, we propose a model accounting for the
modulation of tslp promoter activity by rxr␣(␤)兾vdr and
rxr␣(␤)兾rar␥ heterodimers (schematized in fig. 5). the promoter region of mouse and human tlsp genes includes a tata
box element and proximal elements (e.g., nf-␬b-binding sites) (the
basal promoter) as well as putative vdres and rares (fig. 4 b
and c). because, under homeostatic conditions in vivo, there is no
ra and very little, if any, active  xxxd1682xxx  (see below) in
epidermal keratinocytes, the tslp promoter basal activity is sipnas 兩 august 1, 2006 兩 vol. 103 兩 no. 31 兩 11739

fig. 5. schematic model of rxr␣(␤)兾vdr- and rxr␣(␤)兾rar-mediated regulation of tslp expression in mouse keratinocytes (see discussion). as concluded from our study (25), keratinocytic rxrs are shown bound to a non-raagonistic ligand.

lenced by unliganded rxr␣(␤)兾vdr and rxr␣(␤)兾rar␥ heterodimers associated with corepressors (10) (fig. 5a). this repression can be efficiently exerted by either rxr␣(␤)兾vdr or
rxr␣(␤)兾rar␥ heterodimers, because it cannot be relieved by
ablation of either vdr or rar␥ (fig. 3e and data not shown; fig.
5 b and c). rxr␣ and -␤ ablation (fig. 5d), which releases both
heterodimers from their binding sites, abolishes this repression and
allows basal promoter-bound transcription factors to stimulate
tslp transcription to a basal activity (see fig. 3f, lane 3) that is
sufficient to trigger the generation of an ad-like phenotype (3).
topical application of either active  xxxd1682xxx  or a low-calcemic
analog (mc903) (fig. 5e) generates rxr兾vdr-coactivator complexes whose transcriptional activity (see fig. 3f, lane 2) is efficient
enough to not only relieve the repression exerted by rxr兾rar␥
corepressor complexes but also to further enhance the basal promoter activity. interestingly, the rxr兾rar␥ coactivator complexes formed upon application of bms961 are much less efficient
(fig. 5f ), because they generate lower tslp transcript levels (fig.
1a) than those resulting from the basal promoter activity, as
observed in keratinocytes ablated for rxr␣ and -␤ (see fig. 3f,
lane 3). however, upon cotreatment with bms961 and a limiting
dose of 1␣, xxxd408xxx  (fig. 5g), liganded rxr兾rar␥ and
rxr兾vdr heterodimers can efficiently synergize to enhance the
activity of tslp basal promoter.
it should be stressed that, even though the present model
accounts for all of our present observations, its refinement will
require additional genetic (selective ablation of both vdr and

and rare in the mouse) and biochemical (e.g., chip assays)
studies to determine to which elements the rxr兾vdr and
rxr兾rar heterodimers bind, and whether vdr or rar␥
preferentially heterodimerize with rxr␣ or rxr␤. in any event,
the rapid and regulable induction of tslp in mouse keratinocytes
upon topical treatment with low-calcemic  xxxd1682xxx  analogs (e.g.,
mc903) provides a highly convenient ad preclinical model for
exploring therapeutic avenues as well as a mouse model allowing
characterization of various aspects of ad pathogenesis from its
onset to the fully established disease phenotype. in this respect, we
have found that epidermal thickening and dermal infiltration are
observed in mc903-treated skin of both wt and rag1⫺/⫺ mice
lacking mature t and b cells, showing that, even though 1␣,25(oh)2d3 could directly enhance the formation of th2 cells from
naı̈ve cd4⫹ t cells (18), these cells are actually not required for
tslp-induced development of an ad-like inflammation. thus, the
presence of eosinophils, mast cells, and dermal dendritic cells in
mc903-treated rag1⫺/⫺ mice suggests that tslp could act
directly on these and other myeloid-derived cells to initiate an
atopic inflammation, whereas the additional accumulation of cd4⫹
th2 cells in mc903-treated wt mice may correspond to a secondary effect of tslp expression that serves for further progression of the ad-like phenotype. a similar conclusion was recently
reached by yoo et al. (8) using tcr␤⫺/⫺ mice that lack t cells. as
expected, no ige could be detected in both mc903-treated and
untreated rag1⫺/⫺ mice, indicating that ige are dispensable for
development of the ad-like phenotype, in keeping with the observation that, although elevated serum ige is a frequently associated clinical feature in ad, ⬇20% of ad patients have a normal
serum ige level (4).
recent reports (5–9), including ours (3), have shown that tlsp
represents a master switch of allergic inflammation and established
in the mouse a direct link between tlsp expression in keratinocytes and airway epithelial cells and the pathogenesis of atopic
dermatitis and asthma, respectively. however, how tlsp expression is triggered in these cells upon allergen exposure remains to be
unveiled. our previous (3) and present reports indicate that rxr
heterodimerized with vdr and rar␥ actively suppress tslp
expression, whereas active  xxxd1682xxx  and, to a lesser extent, ra
can relieve this repression, thus raising the question of whether and
how these ligands could be instrumental in triggering tslp production in vivo. in this respect, a possible direct involvement of
 xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx  signaling in atopy is supported by the observation that
vdr-null mutant mice fail to develop symptoms of experimental
asthma (23). furthermore,  xxxd3105xxx  deficiency is known to
diminish th2-mediated responses, whereas high dietary  xxxd3105xxx 
enhances them (24), which may reflect a role of ra-liganded rar
in tslp induction.
under homeostatic conditions in vivo, epidermal keratinocytes
lack ra (11, 25). in keeping with a very low level of tslp
transcripts, others (refs. 14 and 26 and references therein) have
shown that there is very little, if any, active  xxxd1682xxx  in these cells
in which the enzyme 25(oh)d3-1␣-hydroxylase, required for synthesis of 1␣, xxxd408xxx  from 25(oh)d3, is apparently not expressed. what could then be the origin of active  xxxd1682xxx  that
induces tslp expression in atopic dermatitis? interestingly, it has
been recently reported that, upon microbe-derived ligand activation
of their toll-like receptors (tlrs) that mediate the synthesis of
antimicrobial peptides involved in the innate immune response,
human, but not mouse, macrophages can produce 25(oh)d3-1␣hydroxylase and synthesize 1␣, xxxd408xxx  (27, 28). we suggest
that similar activation by allergen-derived ligands, of skin macrophage, dendritic cell, or, possibly, keratinocyte tlrs (29–31) may
provide 1␣, xxxd408xxx  to keratinocytes in either a paracrine or
autocrine manner. thus, upon exposure of skin to an allergen,
tslp production might be triggered through a tlr-mediated
production of active  xxxd1682xxx , raising the interesting possibility

molecular mechanism that could underlie the use of low-calcemic
 xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx  analogs in the treatment of psoriasis (13), a th1
cell-driven skin disease. interestingly, the most-common side effect
of this treatment is a skin irritation (red, dry, and itchy skin) (43)
exhibiting similarities with ad lesions. what our data, therefore,
suggest is that a th1 to th2 skewing of th cell differentiation
triggered by induction of tslp expression in keratinocytes may
contribute to the therapeutic effect of topical mc903 on psoriatic
lesions.

that genetic or acquired defects of tlrs’ function could be
implicated in the pathogenesis of ad. whether, upon allergen
exposure, a tlr-mediated mechanism might also be involved in
the production of ra is unknown.
that  xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx  could be instrumental to the pathogenesis of
atopic diseases in humans is supported by an association between
 xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx  supplementation in infancy and an increased risk of
atopy later in life (32, 33). our present study indicates that this
association could be related to an increase of tslp production in
epithelial cells upon exposure to allergens during the perinatal
period, which may ultimately result in an increase of allergenspecific th2 memory cells which could be instrumental to triggering
allergic reactions later in life. interestingly, genetic investigations
have also indicated that  xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx  signaling could be implicated in
the pathogenesis of atopic diseases, as shown by association of vdr
genetic variants with childhood and adult asthma, and atopic
response (34, 35). these observations suggest that genetic predisposition to atopic disorders may implicate alteration of other
components of  xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx  (and possibly  xxxd3105xxx ) signaling, which
will ultimately result in tslp overproduction. dysregulation of
 xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx  signaling may therefore be a key contributor to both
genetic and environmental factors that underlie atopic diseases.
the therapeutic use of vitamins d and a has been considered for
ad patients (36–39). our present data indicate that, on the
contrary, administration of these vitamins may exacerbate ad and,
very likely, asthma by promoting expression of tslp in skin and
lungs. on the other hand, topical administration of vitamins d
and兾or a antagonists to ad patients may be beneficial, because it
could enhance the repression exerted by rxr兾vdr and rxr兾
rar␥ heterodimers (40) on tslp expression. it has also been
recently suggested that low-calcemic vdr agonists (e.g., mc903)
could be used to boost the innate immune response (through
enhanced antimicrobial peptide production), for instance, to protect against infections and to accelerate wound healing, notably in
the case of chronic ulcerated skin wounds (28, 39, 41, 42). our
results indicate that such therapy may not be beneficial to patients
prone to atopy. finally, our study also provides insight into the
