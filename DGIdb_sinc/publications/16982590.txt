abstract
the effects of estrogens on reproductive tissues and climacteric symptoms are unambiguous. however, their effects on other tissues and, in particular, the cardiovascular system remain controversial.
in general, premenopausal women are protected from coronary heart disease (chd) compared
with aged-matched men but this female protection appears to be lost after menopause, suggesting
beneficial effects of female sex hormones on the cardiovascular system. this view has been supported by observational studies showing that estrogen replacement therapy (ert) is associated with a
30% to 50% decrease in chd risk in postmenopausal women. nevertheless, randomized clinical
trials in postmenopausal women, with or without pre-existing chd, have found no benefits to combined hormone replacement therapy (hrt). a possible explanation for these apparently contradictory findings may relate to the divergent effects of estrogens depending on the state of the vascular
endothelium. it has been suggested that estrogens may prevent the development and early progression of atherosclerosis by contributing to the maintenance of endothelial health but may have a
neutral or negative effect on a dysfunctional endothelium or on advanced atheromatous lesions.
furthermore, it is possible that estrogens have adverse effects on other cardiovascular risk factors
such as thrombosis and inflammation. it is also conceivable that a decline in vascular  xxxg730xxx  expression with advancing age, through methylation of the  xxxg730xxx  promoter, prevents
postmenopausal women from deriving the beneficial cardiovascular effects of estrogens. in conclusion, estrogens possibly prevent the development of atherosclerosis through favourable effects on an
intact endothelium, but once the vascular endothelium is damaged, the prothrombotic and possibly
proinflammatory effects of estrogens are likely to predominate and prove harmful.

women are largely protected from coronary heart disease (chd) compared with men of similar age1. this
phenomenon, referred to as  xxxd2531xxx , is
gradually lost after menopause, so that by the sixth
decade women have the same incidence of chd as
men. the protection of premenopausal women from
chd has been attributed to the cardioprotective effect of female sex hormones1. estrogens are involved
in many physiological processes which are known to

be important for cardiovascular health in women and
were until recently considered to protect women from
cardiovascular disease (cvd). extensive evidence
from observational studies support this view, especially
in regard to chd2,3. however, randomized clinical trials in postmenopausal women, with or without chd,
have shown no benefits from combined hormone replacement therapy (hrt), casting doubt on the cardioprotective effect of estrogens on postmenopausal
women4,5.

it has recently been suggested that the loss of
healthy vascular endothelium may prevent women
from deriving cardioprotective benefits from endogenous or exogenous estrogens6. according to this hypothesis, the favourable antiatherogenic and other
favourable vascular effects of estrogens are endothelium-dependent and receptor-mediated. consequently, endothelial injury or decline in vascular estrogen
receptor expression can diminish the cardiovascular
benefits of the sex hormones. this concept may in part
explain the disparity between the observational studies showing a cardioprotective effect of estrogens in
healthy postmenopausal women and the recently published clinical trials on secondary and primary prevention of chd in postmenopausal women with hrt
which showed a different effect4,5.

in this review, we report on the biological effects
of estrogens on the vascular system and in particular
on endothelial function, and we analyze the divergent
results from the observational studies and randomized clinical trials. it seems that the likely role of estrogens is to contribute to the maintenance of a healthy
vascular endothelium but, in the presence of endothelial injury and the atheromatous vascular wall, the
use of hrt could be harmful.

sources of estrogens in women
the naturally occurring estrogens 17â-estradiol
(e2), estriol (e3) and estrone (e1) are c18 steroids
derived from cholesterol through a series of enzymatic reactions in steroidogenic cells (figure 1).
in women of reproductive age, estrogens are produced mainly in the ovaries. under the influence of
 xxxd2226xxx   xxxd2520xxx  (lh) the ovarian theca cells produce two androgenic steroids,  xxxd176xxx  and
testosterone, which are aromatized in granulosa cells
into e1 and e2, respectively, by the action of follicle

stimulating hormone (fsh). following ovulation, the
luteinized cells produce progesterone during the luteal
phase of the menstrual cycle. progesterone has two
roles: transformation of the endometrium after estrogen priming (luteominetic effect), and antiestrogenic
effect limiting proliferation of the endometrium.
in premenopausal women e2 levels range from 1080pg/ml during the follicular phase and reach the level of 600pg/ml at midcycle. after menopause the concentration of e2 falls to 5-30pg/ml. the main estrogen in menopausal women is e1, resulting from aromatization in adipose tissue of androstenedione which
is produced by the adrenals.
in the circulation, estrogens bind mainly to sex
hormone binding globulin (shbg) produced in the
liver and only a small amount of estrogens (2-3%) remains free7. changes in shbg levels may influence
the tissue availability of free estrogens but also of free
androgens, since the latter are also bound to shbg.
although estrogens themselves increase shbg levels, androgens and high insulin levels have the opposite effect. in menopause, the fall of estrogens in women is associated with reduced shbg leading to decreased binding and thus to an increase in the level of
free androgens. estrogens fall to a greater extent and
the androgen/estrogen ratio rises. the alteration in
the balance between androgens and estrogens may
contribute to changes in body composition and other
symptoms associated with the menopause8.
in addition to endogenous estrogens, there are also
exogenous sources of estrogen such as the oral contraceptives (oc) and hormone replacement therapy

estrogens and cardiovascular disease

(hrt). the ocs consist of ethinyl-estradiol combined
with a synthetic progestogen. for hrt, conjugated
equine estrogens ( xxxd2044xxx ) or other oral or transdermal
forms of synthetic estrogens are used in association
with an orally administered progestogen. the
progestogen is administered either cyclically or in a
continuous combined regimen and is included in order to avoid the risk of endometrial hyperplasia9.
selective  xxxg730xxx  modulators (serms)
belong to another category of chemical substances that
have an estrogenic like activity with regard to vascular endothelium and bones, but an anti-estrogenic effect on the mammary gland and endometrium10.  xxxd3372xxx  is a new synthetic steroid with a progestogenlike structure that is converted to estrogenic and androgenic derivatives in different tissues and is also used
as hrt11. finally, phytoestrogens, derived from various plants, have an estrogen-like activity that may help
in reducing climacteric and menopausal symptoms12.

estrogen receptors and molecular
effects
estrogens act in target tissues by binding to estrogen receptors that belong to the large family of nuclear ligand-activated transcription factors13. once bound
by estrogen, the  xxxg730xxx  undergoes a conformational change, allowing the receptor to bind with
high affinity to specific dna-sequences or response
elements (eres) and modulate transcription of target genes 14 . two types of estrogen receptors are
known;  xxxg730xxx -á (erá) and  xxxg730xxx -â (erâ), encoded by different genes. both receptor types are found in the cells of the cardiovascular system as well as in various other human tissues.
erâ is distributed differently from erá within the
tissues of the body and probably mediates different
cell functions, but this is a field that needs further investigation.
several studies have demonstrated the presence
of functional estrogen-receptors in vascular endothelial cells as well as in smooth muscle cells15,16. in women with premature atherosclerosis, a decreased er
expression on atherosclerotic arteries has been observed17.
regarding the role of er in the regulation of endothelial function, a number of studies using selective er-antagonists have taken place. the results of

173

these studies have shown that 17â-estradiol enhances
the production and activity of the enzyme  xxxd2738xxx 
synthase (enos), either via classical effects on gene
transcription (genomic regulation), or via a non-genomic pathway18. the latter refers to a rapid stimulation of endothelial no production in an er-dependent manner18,19. there is strong evidence that enos
is targeted to the endothelial plasma membrane, particularly to caveolae, which are specialized membrane
domains20-22. a subpopulation of erá is localized to
endothelial-cell caveolae where they are coupled to
enos in a functional complex that mediates non-genomic activation of enos. the rapid stimulation of
enos by 17â-estradiol is due to an increase in intracellular calcium, mediated by tyrosine-kinase/map-kinase activation23,24.
since no is the main vasodilator and the best antioxidant substance, its decreased production causes
endothelial dysfunction. thus, a reduced estrogenic
action, either as a result of decreased estrogen levels
or reduced number of functional erá in blood vessels and endothelium, probably constitutes a considerable cardiovascular risk factor as it may lead to premature endothelial dysfunction and therefore to atherosclerosis25.

vascular effects of estrogens
the blood vessel wall consists of smooth muscle
cells and a lining of endothelial cells, both of which
have functional ers as referred to above. consequently, estrogens are believed to play a significant role with
regard to vascular homeostasis. their principal effect
appears to be on the regulation of vascular tone. generally, two types of factors modulate vascular tone:
vaso-constrictive, such as  xxxg674xxx , thromboxane,
prostaglandin h2 and angiotensin, and vaso-relaxing
factors. the predominant relaxing factor is no, produced by the endothelial cells. release of no activates smooth muscle cell quanylate cyclase, which in
turn causes an increase in cgmp production leading
to vasodilation26. other relaxing factors, such as prostacyclin and hyperpolarizing factor, act through camp
and potassium channels. the no release also has an
anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic effect because
it prevents platelet aggregation and suppresses smooth
muscle cell proliferation27.
these two actions prevent endothelial dysfunction

174

which is regarded as an early manifestation of atherosclerosis28,29.
the clinical evaluation of endothelial function is
based on the observation of vasodilative ability after
pharmacological or mechanical stimuli30. for this purpose three techniques have been adopted. the first
two exploit the administration of acetylcholine intracoronary and intraarterially, which provides a dilatory effect and an increase in blood-flow, respectively.
the third technique uses increased blood-flow shear
(flow-mediated) as a mechanical means to estimate
vasodilation through no release30. the most commonly used technique is measurement of branchial artery
diameter changes with high-frequency ultrasound after blood pressure cuff-induced hyperemia31. the use
of nitroglycerine (tnt) or nitroprusside helps to estimate the non-endothelium dependent vasodilation.
there is evidence that estrogens contribute to the
maintenance of endothelial health. in fact, the arterial endothelial no seems to be the primary vascular target of estrogens32 which exert two types of effects with regard to endothelial function.
first, estrogens have long-term effects which are
mediated at the level of gene transcription (genomic
regulation). these effects are due to an increase in
the expression and activity of enos, as explained
above18,32,33. furthermore, it has been observed that
estrogens (particularly unopposed  xxxd2044xxx ) reduce plasma levels of endogenous assymetric dimethylarginine
(adma)34, an inhibitor of enos35 and a cardiovascular risk factor36.
clinical observations support these effects. not
only do estrogens cause vasodilation and increased
blood-flow, but these responses also depend on plasma levels of estrogens. the observations that in young
women endothelium-dependent vasodilation in branchial artery varies with the phase of the menstrual cycle, favours this conclusion37,38. researchers have used
blood pressure cuff-induced hyperemia to study endothelial function in premenopausal and postmenopausal women and found that there were greater vasodilatory responses in premenopausal women. when
tnt or nitroprusside was used, the responses in preand postmenopausal women were quite similar39-41.
estrogen replacement therapy (ert) given to postmenopausal women enhanced endothelium-dependent dilation in the branchial and coronary arteries42,43.

l. gouva, a. tsatsoulis

similar results were observed in women with premature ovarian failure or ovariectomy after the use of
estrogen, as well as in young women who used oral
contraceptives41,44. it is of interest that inclusion of
progesterone in postmenopausal hrt may blunt the
effects of estrogens on endothelial no production44.
in addition, estrogens exert short-term effects on
the endothelium, causing rapid dilation by both endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent
pathways33. thus, estrogens can cause rapid vasodilation (within minutes) when given intravenously or intraarterially in postmenopausal women45. these effects
are probably mediated by a subpopulation of erá
localized to caveolae in endothelial cells and coupled
to enos in a non genomic manner, as mentioned
above20-22.
estrogens also exert additional effects. these include stimulation of prostacycline, that causes vasodilation, and inhibition of  xxxg674xxx -production in
human vascular endothelial cells46. in addition, estrogens prevent apoptosis in human vascular endothelial
cells and inhibit the migration and proliferation of
smooth muscle cells in vitro47-49.

systemic effects of estrogens
effects on lipids and lipoproteins
estrogens have beneficial effects on lipids and lipoproteins, but these effects depend on the type of
estrogen used, the route of administration, the coadministration of progestogen and the type of progestogen50.
in general, oral estrogens reduce cholesterol accumulation in peripheral tissues and increase its biliary excretion51,52. in particular, estrogens decrease
total cholesterol and low-density-lipoprotein (ldl)
cholesterol by about 5-15%, due to an increase in the
liver ldl-receptors, and enhancement of ldl-catabolism and clearance. estrogens also reduce apolipoprotein (a) {lp (a)} and increase high-density-lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol by about 10% by decreasing hdl-receptors in liver cells. on the other hand,
estrogens increase plasma triglycerides (tg) by 2025%.
in addition to its effect on serum lipid profile, estradiol has an antioxidant capacity so that when 17âestradiol is given to menopausal women, it reduces

estrogens and cardiovascular disease

175

oxidation of ldl cholesterol and enhances endothelial no bioactivity53.
transdermal estrogens do not affect serum lipids
and lipoproteins and this is probably related to the
absence of a first-pass hepatic effect54. on the other
hand, progestogens have no influence on ldl or
lp(a), but they appear to have an antiestrogenic activity on hdl and trgs50.
recent evidence suggests that remnant lipoprotein
particles (rlps) are the most atherogenic lipid particles. rlps were associated with endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis and were identified as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease in
women55. a recent randomized study has shown that
hrt has beneficial effects on rlps, with no influence on triglycerides56.

effects of estrogens on hemostasis
hemostasis is a natural mechanism of the human
body aimed at halting bleeding irrespective of its cause.
for this purpose a number of coagulant factors play
an important role. on the other hand, there are regulatory factors, i.e. anticoagulant factors and the fibrinolytic system, with opposite effects, so that hemostasis does not lead to vessel obstruction. an outline of
this hemostatic balance is given in figure 2.
estrogens appear to interfere in the hemostatic
balance as they regulate, through estrogen receptors,
the expression of genes for a number of coagulant and
fibrinolytic proteins57. this regulation is probably under genetic control because the hemostatic system of
some women appears to be more sensitive than that
of other women58.
it has been reported that in postmenopausal women the levels of  xxxg750xxx , factor vw and fibrinogen
are elevated59. these factors are important risk markers for ischemic heart disease. on the other hand, the
use of hrt in postmenopausal women decreases the
level of fibrinogen, but also decreases  xxxg1850xxx  and
 xxxg2056xxx  and enhances activity of factor vii60.
in addition, increased levels of pai-1 have been
found in postmenopausal women, leading to fibrinolysis inactivation that is associated with atherosclerosis61. even small doses of ert reduce pai-1 and activate the fibrinolytic system. the combination with
progestogens maintain the same beneficial effects, although transdermal estrogens do not influence pai-

willebrant, tpa:tissue plasminogen activator, pai-1: plasminogen
activator inhibitor type 1.

162,63. the activation of fibrinolysis does not appear to
be dose-dependent, unlike the coagulatory activity61.

effects of estrogens on inflammatory markers
atherogenesis and the ensuing plaque disruption
are the result of an inflammatory process that takes
place in the vessel wall.  xxxg520xxx  (crp) is
the most important marker of inflammation and the
strongest independent predictor of cardiovascular
events in apparently healthy women64,65.
there is evidence that the level of crp rises in
postmenopausal women using oral estrogens66,67, although the latter reduce other inflammatory markers
such as  xxxg2048xxx   xxxg2406xxx , icam-1 and soluble
thrombomodulin68. this indicates that the rise in crp
levels is not the result of an increased inflammatory
response but has to do with a metabolic liver-activation. by contrast, studies in animals where estrogens
were given subcutaneously or intravenously failed to
demonstrate such pro-inflammatory effects69. it appears that the route of administration of estrogen may

176

be important with regard to its adverse effects on inflammatory markers65.
thus, the use of hrt in women with pre-existing
coronary heart disease may become problematic70.
hrt reduces serum levels of the cell adhesion molecules that may inhibit attachment of white blood cells
to the vessel wall, but this therapy also causes a rise in
serum levels of  xxxg1440xxx  ( xxxg1440xxx ).
in addition, hrt decreases plasma levels of pai-1
leading to plasmin activation, which may also activate
metalloproteinases. these events in women with atheromatous plaques could result in digestion of the matrix proteins of the fibrous cap and therefore provoke
thrombosis71,72.

hormone replacement therapy and
cardiovascular disease: clinical studies
premenopausal women develop cvd less frequently than men of similar age. however, the protection that women appear to have during their reproductive age fades after menopause when the rate
of coronary heart events tends to be equal to that of
men73. among the measures that have been taken over
the last few decades to reduce the risk of cvd are
lifestyle changes and pharmacologic interventions.
hrt was among the pharmacologic interventions and
was thought to have beneficial effects in postmenopausal women74,75.

observational studies
a large number of observational studies have suggested that the use of exogenous estrogens might be
cardioprotective. in a review of population-based,
case-control, cross-sectional and prospective studies
of estrogen therapy (in the form of  xxxd2044xxx ), the relative
risk for chd was reduced by approximately 50%76. in
current hormone users there were reductions in chdrisk which ranged from 35% to 50%, compared to nonusers75,77. in the nurses health study, in which 70,533
postmenopausal women were followed-up for 20 years,
the relative risk of major coronary events was 0.61(ci:
0.52-0.71) for current use of estrogens, adjusted for
age and the common cardiovascular risk factors3. in a
recent study, the progress of coronary atherosclerosis
was estimated by measurement of coronary artery calcium (cac) with electron beam computed tomography (ebt)78. the participants of this study were 2,213
healthy postmenopausal women with a mean age of

l. gouva, a. tsatsoulis

59 years; half of the women were current users of hrt.
the results showed that current hrt use decreased
the possibility of high calcium score by 50%.therefore, these results indicate that hrt use is associated
with less coronary artery atherosclerosis as estimated
by cac, since high calcium scores are significant predictors of cardiovascular events in most large observational studies79,80. in addition, the study showed that
the longer women received hrt, the greater was the
fall in the calcium score (dose-response relationship).
in general, observational studies promoted the
belief that hrt plays a cardioprotective role. however, in a recent observational study in women with
established coronary heart disease, the use of hrt
was harmful. there was an increase in the cardiovascular events in women who started hrt after a myocardial infarction81.
with regard to the observational studies there are
two important issues worthy of discussion. first there
is the problem of bias. in these studies comparisons
were made between women who have elected to take
hrt and women who either elected not to take hrt
or who themselves had not considered taking it (selection bias)82. these two groups of women may have
had different lifestyles and educational or socioeconomic status. women who used hrt were likely to
have also taken more preventive health measures compared to women not on hrt, therefore, they were
also likely to be at lower risk for chd regardless of
hrt use83. however, in the nurses health cohort
study, in which users and non-users had the same social status and educational level, hormone use also
appeared to be protective3.
the second issue concerns the type of hormone
regimen used, as women in the observational studies
used mainly unopposed  xxxd2044xxx . on the other hand, it is
known that progestogens may oppose some of the estrogen effects on the cardiovascular system84. however, a limited number of observational studies with combined hrt suggest that the effect of progestogen may
not be substantial, although the type of progestogen
used may be relevant.
as the role of hrt in menopause remained inconclusive, the need for clinical trials in order to clarify the potential role of hrt on cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women became apparent.

estrogens and cardiovascular disease

randomized clinical trials
the heart and estrogen/progestin replacement
study (hers) was the first large clinical trial to test
the use of hrt as secondary prevention in women
with established coronary heart disease4. hers was a
double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized study of
2,763 postmenopausal american women, of mean age
66.7 years, who received combined continuous oral
hrt {0.625mg  xxxd2044xxx  plus 2.5mg mpa (medroxyprogesterone-acetate) daily} or placebo. the trial was
ended prematurely after 4.1 years because there was
an increase in the coronary and thromboembolic
events in women who used hrt during the first year,
although the serum lipid profile had improved. by the
fourth year of study, cardiovascular events were fewer in the hrt-users than in the placebo group. however, recently published data from an extension of the
hers study to 6 years (hers ii) have indicated that
the trend towards reduction in cardiovascular events
did not continue85. because of an increase in the risk
of venous thrombosis among hrt-users, it was suggested that hrt is not beneficial in women with established cardiovascular disease who already have atherosclerotic plaques prone to rupture.
there was some criticism of the hers trial results86. the first criticism was the older age of women
participating in the study. it was then suggested that
lower doses of estrogens might be more beneficial with
regard to the progress of atherosclerosis. another issue was the fact that in hers a specific combination
of hormones was used ( xxxd2044xxx +mpa). whether the
results would be the same if other combinations of
estrogen+progestogen were used remained unanswered. the answer to this came from another study,
the papworth hormone replacement therapy atherosclerosis study. in this study postmenopausal women used transdermal 17â-estradiol alone or in combination with  xxxd2751xxx . again, this regimen had
no benefit in reducing chd events in women with
pre-existing cvd87.
the second clinical trial was the estrogen replacement and atherosclerosis (era), a randomized trial
in postmenopausal women who had angiographically
defined chd at baseline in order to evaluate coronary artery changes after the use of hrt88. again,
neither  xxxd2044xxx  alone nor in combination with mpa were
effective in slowing down the progress of atherosclerosis in coronary arteries, although beneficial effects

177

on lipid profile were noted.
it was concluded from these studies that hrt
should not be used for secondary prevention of chd.
subsequently, the role of hrt for primary prevention of chd was addressed.
to this end, a large clinical trial, the womens
health initiative (whi), was designed5,89. it was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical
trial of 16,608 postmenopausal women, aged 50 to 71
years (mean age 63.7 years), who received either continuous oral combined  xxxd2044xxx  (0.625mg) + mpa
(2.5mg) or placebo daily. another group of 10,739
postmenopausal women without uterus, as a result of
hysterectomy, used  xxxd2044xxx  alone or placebo. this part
of the study is still running. however, the first part
was stopped after 5.2 years of follow-up because the
risks exceeded the benefits. there was an increased
risk of invasive breast cancer (8 cases/10,000 women),
which rose the longer the women continued the therapy. the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarctions and
coronary death also increased (7 cases/10,000 women) especially during the first year of the study. the
risk of venous thromboembolism was doubled (18/
10,000 women). finally, there was an excess risk of
stroke (8/10,000) throughout the trial. these results
disappointed the optimists among the scientists who
believed that hrt could prevent cvd in healthy postmenopausal women. on the other hand, some benefits from the use of hrt were identified. the incidence of hip fractures was reduced (8/10,000), as was
the incidence of colorectal cancer (6/10,000). there
was no overall benefit, however, over the 5.2 years of
the trial.
the estrogen in the prevention of atherosclerosis trial (epat) followed up postmenopausal women without preexisting chd in order to estimate the
effect of the oral use of 1mg 17â-estradiol in the
progress of carotid atherosclerosis90. women in whom
serum ldl was above 160mg/dl received  xxxd1724xxx 
therapy. the results showed that these women had no
alterations in the carotid artery ultrasound after two
years of oral therapy. in contrast, in women with low
serum ldl-levels, the use of 17â-estradiol slowed the
progression of carotid intima-media thickness in comparison to placebo. overall, this trial showed a beneficial effect of estrogen use in healthy postmenopausal women with regard to atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries. on the other hand, another clinical trial,

178

the well-hart (womens estrogen/progestin lipid lowering hormone atherosclerosis regression
trial) in postmenopausal women with established coronary artery atherosclerosis, showed that the use of
17â-estradiol alone or in combination with mpa had
no influence on the progression of atherosclerosis evaluated by coronary angiography, compared to placebo91.
surprisingly, therefore, the results from randomized clinical trials of hrt use in postmenopausal
women for primary or secondary prevention of chd
do not support the observational data on the cardioprotective role of estrogens. several possible explanations for the divergent data on postmenopausal
hrt have been suggested.

the complexity of sex steroid effects
the main estrogen in the hrt used in the clinical
trials is  xxxd2044xxx  which is usually prescribed in the u.s.a.
on the other hand, 17â-estradiol is more commonly
used in europe, but there have been no observational
data or large clinical trials for primary prevention with
17â-estradiol86.
another possible explanation might be the high
dose of estrogens used. there is evidence that lower
doses of estrogen have beneficial effects on lipoproteins and coagulant factors. furthermore, older women, such as the participants in the two large clinical
trials, may be more susceptible to inflammatory and
thrombotic effects of higher doses of estrogen92.
on the other hand, it is possible that the use of
progestogen in combination with estrogen may mask
estrogens cardioprotective role86. this will probably
be clarified at the end of the second part of the whi
study in which 10,739 women without uterus received
 xxxd2044xxx  alone or placebo.
in addition, oral estrogens increase crp66,67 and
induce expression of matrix metalloproteinases within the vessel wall. the latter can digest and weaken
fibrous caps of vulnerable plaques, leading to thrombosis71,72.
another criticism of the whi trial is the fact that
the women participating were older, so that they were
likely to already have existing atherosclerotic changes. since atherosclerosis down-regulates estrogen receptors, the transcription of multiple genes, some of
which are responsible for the potential protective ef-

l. gouva, a. tsatsoulis

fects of estrogen, is reduced and this fact cannot be
excluded86.

the state of the vascular endothelium
experimental and clinical evidence suggests that
the effects of estrogens are dependent on the integrity and functional status of the vascular endothelium
and the presence or absence of atherosclerotic changes in the vascular wall. this healthy endothelium hypothesis may in part explain the unfavourable findings of the hers and whi trials and guide future
strategies of the use of hrt6.
according to this hypothesis, endothelial injury or
decline in vascular  xxxg730xxx  expression can
diminish the antiatherogenic properties of estrogens.
indeed, experimental studies have examined the effects of endothelial damage induced by balloon catheter injury in rabbits and how estrogens affect progression of atherosclerosis. it was found that the antiatherogenic effects of estrogens were present, absent
or reversed depending on the state of the arterial endothelium93.
studies in oophorectomized cynomolgous monkeys
also support this hypothesis. thus, in monkeys assigned to  xxxd2044xxx  (alone or in combination with mpa)
beginning two years (approximately six human years)
after oophorectomy and well after atherosclerosis was
established, hrt had no effect on the extent of coronary artery plaque. however, when hrt was given to
monkeys immediately after the oophorectomy, during the early stages of atherosclerosis, there was a 50%
reduction in the extent of plaque formation94. in this
regard, in the nurses health study women ranged in
age from 30 to 55 years at enrollment and almost 80%
began estrogens within two years after menopause3.
in contrast, the mean age of the participants in the
hers and in the whi trials were 67 and 63 years,
respectively, and thus on average 10 years postmenopausal at the time of enrollment, an age at which atherosclerosis had already set in.
furthermore, studies in humans have shown that
non-diseased coronary artery vessels dilate in response
to the administration of estrogens, whereas diseased
vessels do not respond95. the lack of  xxxg730xxx  expression in the presence of atherosclerosis may
result in a decreased ability of vascular tissue to respond to estrogens17. in this regard, down-regulation
of ers, may have an impact on the effectiveness of

estrogens and cardiovascular disease

estrogen. it is well established that an important mechanism for down-regulation of gene-expression is methylation of a cytosine and guanine rich area in the
promoter-region of the erá-gene, called cpg-island.
methylation leads to permanent inactivation of genetranscription in multiple systems96.
it has been shown that age and perhaps vascular
injury are associated with de novo methylation of the
erá-gene promoter in smooth muscle cells. these
cells lose some of the normal growth control and, under certain conditions, proliferate abnormally and may
contribute to the pathogenesis of the atheromatous
plaque. another scenario is the possibility that erágene-methylation is the result of atherosclerosis and
hyperproliferation97.
it is tempting to speculate that in women with advanced atherosclerosis, erá-gene methylation in diseased vessels may contribute to the lack of benefit after
the use of hrt observed in the clinical trials with older
postmenopausal women97. according to recent research evidence, methylation may possibly be reversed
pharmacologically by the use of inhibitors of the dnamethyltransferase enzyme98.

alternative therapies to hrt
since the use of conventional hrt regimens has
already been shown to have disadvantages, scientists
have turned their interest to alternative therapies in
order to minimize the side effects of estrogen and
explore their beneficial effects.
the first category of these new therapies consists
of the selective  xxxg730xxx  modulators
[serms], which are non-steroidal estrogen compounds with an estrogen like effect (on lipoproteins
and bones) as well as an estrogenic antagonist effect
on the mammary gland and endometrium7. raloxifene
reduces the level of ldl-cholesterol and fibrinogen
in plasma, but has no effect on hdl levels99. there
have been various studies with divergent results. in
ovariectomized cholesterol-fed rabbits, a reduction in
aortic atherosclerosis was reported with the use of
raloxifene but to a lesser extent than that with the use
of 17â-estradiol100. studies in monkeys showed no beneficial effect of raloxifene99. in the more trial (multiple outcomes of raloxifene evaluation trial), with
more than 7,000 postmenopausal women participating, raloxifene was shown to have no benefits com-

179

pared with placebo in regard to chd and cardiovascular events, but this was not the primary aim of the
study. however, in women with increased risk of cardiovascular disease there were fewer events compared
with placebo101. another study, the ruth trial (raloxifene use for the heart study), is currently testing
the impact of raloxifene on cardiovascular end-points
in postmenopausal women. the results of this trial
will provide further information on the role of serms
in cvd.
another category, with  xxxd3372xxx  as first representative, is the selective tissue estrogenic activity regulators (stear). stear have a progestogen-like
structure that is converted to estrogenic and androgenic derivatives in-vivo.  xxxd3372xxx  is effective in the
control of climacteric symptoms (due to its 3-oh
metabolites) and in maintaining bone density, without stimulating tissues such as the endometrium and
mammary gland102,103. thus  xxxd3372xxx  is different from
estrogens and serms as it reduces menopausal symptoms and the risk of thromboembolism (it promotes
fibrinolysis rather than thrombosis).  xxxd3372xxx  also
decreases not only triglycerides and lp (a) levels but
also hdl-cholesterol104,105. however, there have been
no clinical trials on the effect of  xxxd3372xxx  on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women.
finally, within the spectrum of alternative therapies to hrt are the phytoestrogens, a group of natural compounds derived from herbs with estrogen agonist and antagonist properties106. the strongest estrogenic activity has been observed in soy in which the
removal of a glucone-group significantly raises its bioactivity106-110. high estrogen activity was also discovered in extract of fo-ti, not previously reported 106. soy
phytoestrogens have shown beneficial effects on endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the development
of atherosclerosis in non-human primates108,111. some
studies in postmenopausal women, though not all, have
shown beneficial effects on lipid profile and in endothelial function112. clinical end-point data are not available, however, so that recommendations regarding the
use of phytoestrogens for the prevention of cvd cannot be formulated as yet.

conclusions and future directions
based on the favourable effects of estrogens on
various tissues and functions, including the cardiovas-

180

cular system, clinicians hoped that the use of estrogen alone or in combination with progestogen as replacement therapy in postmenopausal women would
offer, among other benefits, cardioprotection. unfortunately, clinical trials have not confirmed the cardioprotective role of hrt. it appears that in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease,
hrt use might in fact be harmful because it increases cardiovascular events and the risk of venous thrombosis. possible explanations for the divergent data
between the observational studies and clinical trials
include the type of estrogen and the high doses used,
the possible antagonistic effects of progestogen, the
age of the women who participated in the clinical trials and the state of the endothelium and stage of atherosclerosis at the time of intervention.
the early danger for both coronary heart disease
and stroke observed in both the hers and whi trials may be a thrombotic effect, reflecting a synergistic
effect between one of the relatively common hypercoaculable states and hormone therapy113. another
possible explanation is the pro-inflammatory effect of
oral estrogens, with rupture of vulnerable plaques86.
although clinical trials showed not only lack of
benefits but also an adverse effect on the cardiovascular system after the use of hrt, one cannot ignore
studies showing the beneficial effect of estrogens in
the early stages of atherogenesis during the menopausal transition and the early years after menopause.
in the ensuing years new strategies should be adopted in clinical trials. thus, the use of lower doses of
estrogen or combinations with different progestogen,
novel estrogen agonists including vascular serms, a
combination of serms or phytoestrogens with lowdose estrogens and better timing of intervention are
possibly some of the future directions for hormone
replacement therapy.
on the other hand, it is important to emphasize
behaviour changes and, where appropriate, lipid and
blood pressure medication, which have been proved
to reduce chd-risk in postmenopausal women, should
be considered86. for the time being, however, hrt is
suspended for the primary and secondary prevention
of chd in postmenopausal women.
