catecholaminergic activation of myocardial ␤-adrenergic receptors
(␤ar) is the principle mechanism regulating cardiac function.
agonists desensitize ␤ar through  xxxg676xxx   xxxg1336xxx 
kinase-mediated uncoupling and ␤-arrestin-mediated internalization. although inhibition of myocardial  xxxg676xxx   xxxg1336xxx 
kinase-2 enhances cardiac function and reverses heart failure,
pathophysiological effects of modulated ␤ar internalization兾recycling are unknown. we used mutation and transgenic expression
of rab4, which regulates vesicular transport of heptahelical receptors to plasma membranes, to interrogate in vivo ␤ar trafficking
and cardiac function. expression of constitutively active rab4 q72l
had no effects on cardiac structure or function, but dominant
inhibitor rab4 s27n impaired responsiveness to endogenous and
exogenous catecholamines. to relate ␤ar trafficking to diminished
cardiac function, rab4 mutant mice were crossbred with mice
overexpressing human ␤2ar. in unstimulated ␤2ar overexpressors, ␤2ar localized to heavier endosomes and translocated to
lighter, caveolin-rich fractions after  xxxd2401xxx  stimulation. coexpression of ␤2ar with activated rab4 q72l caused loss of
receptors from heavier endosomes while retaining normal inotropy. in contrast, coexpression of ␤2ar with inhibitory rab4 s27n
mimicked  xxxd2401xxx -induced receptor redistribution to caveolae, with diminished cardiac inotropy. rab4 inhibition alone prevented resensitization after  xxxd2401xxx -induced in vivo adrenergic desensitization. confocal and ultrastructural analyses
revealed bizarre vesicular structures and abnormal accumulation of
␤2ar in the sarcoplasm and subsarcollema of rab4 s27n, but not
q72l, mice. these data provide evidence for constant bidirectional
sarcollemal–vesicular ␤ar trafficking in the in vivo heart and show
that rab4-mediated recycling of internalized ␤ar is necessary for
normal cardiac catecholamine responsiveness and resensitization
after agonist exposure.

a

critical regulator of minute-by-minute cardiac function is
the ␤-adrenergic receptor (␤ar). in response to acute
physical or emotional stress, stimulation of myocardial ␤ar by
circulating epinephrine or locally released norepinephrine increases cardiac contractility, heart rate, and blood flow to vital
organs (1). in chronic heart failure, activation of this pathway to
compensate for cardiac insufficiency is defective, resulting in
further increased sympathetic outflow and myocardial catecholamine toxicity (2, 3). specific ␤ar abnormalities that have been
identified in heart failure include receptor down-regulation and
uncoupling from signaling effectors (4, 5). the therapeutic
efficacy of pharmacological ␤ar blockade in heart failure has
been linked to reversal of these abnormalities (6).
agonist-mediated uncoupling of ␤ar signaling involves gprotein receptor kinase (grk)-mediated phosphorylation
events (7, 8), whereas down-regulation of receptors is a ␤-arrestin-dependent process of transvesicular receptor internalization and trafficking (9). ␤ar move from plasma membranes into
endosomal structures where they are either targeted for lysosomal degradation or recycled as fully functional receptors by
vesicular trafficking back to plasma membranes (resensitization)
(10). although the roles for grk-mediated ␤ar receptor–

effector uncoupling in cardiac health and disease have been
established (11–14), the pathophysiological roles of modulated
␤ar receptor internalization兾recycling have not been defined,
largely because suitable in vivo experimental models do not exist.
herein, we used rab-gtpases, regulators of inter-vesicular
membrane transport (15), to define effects of modulated ␤ar
trafficking in the in vivo heart. these studies indicate that
bidirectional sarcolemmal–vesicular ␤ar trafficking occurs
continuously in the healthy heart and is necessary for normal
baseline adrenergic responsiveness and resensitization after
catecholamine exposure.
methods
generation of mutant rab4 transgenic mice. transgenic mice used

the ␣-myosin heavy chain (mhc) promoter to express constitutively active (gtpase deficient) q72l or dominant inhibitory
(non-gtp-binding) s27n rab4 mutants (16), identified by
genomic southern analysis of tail clip dna. human ␤2ar
(h-␤2ar) transgenic mice were created by using an attenuated
␣-mhc promoter (17) as previously described (18). animals
were treated in accordance with approved university of cincinnati institutional animal care and use committee protocols.
immunoblot analysis. analysis of h-␤2ar content and subcellular
trafficking were performed by using santa cruz h-20 anti␤2ar. proteins were visualized by using enhanced chemifluorescence and quantitated by using a storm phosphorimager.
anti-flag was from sigma. antibodies recognizing rab1b,
rab3, rab4,  xxxg1915xxx , rab6, g␣s, g␣q兾11, g␣o, g␤,  xxxg970xxx , and
clathrin were from santa cruz. anti-caveolin-3 was from transduction laboratories (lexington, ky). anti g␣i-1兾g␣i-2 was
from perkin–elmer.
buoyant density fractionation of myocardial endosomes was
modified from condorelli and coworkers (19). for each preparation, three frozen mouse ventricles were pulverized on liquid
nitrogen. the powder was added to 1.5 ml of mes-buffered saline
(mbs; 0.15 m nacl兾25 mm mes, ph 6.5) and homogenized.
sucrose was added to 40% final concentration, and the sample
was placed in an ultracentrifuge tube and sequentially overlaid
with 2.25 ml of mbs兾30% sucrose兾250 mm na2co3; and 2.25
ml of mbs兾5% sucrose兾250 mm na2co3. after centrifugation
in a sorvall th641 swinging bucket rotor at 100,000 ⫻ g for 16 h,
ten sequential 0.75-ml fractions were collected by aspiration, and
20 ␮l of each was size-separated on 10% sds兾page gels.

activated (q72l) and inhibitory (s27n) rab4 mutants (15, 16).
multiple lines of both transgenes were grossly normal for 1 year.
in contrast to the cardiomyopathy of rab1 overexpression (20),
rab4 mutants had minimal cardiac effects. heart weights were
similar between  xxxd2741xxx  (134 ⫾ 9 mg, n ⫽ 7), rab4 q72l (151 ⫾
4 mg, n ⫽ 10), and rab4 s27n (143 ⫾ 9 mg, n ⫽ 13). northern
analysis showed no abnormalities of hypertrophy-associated
genes, and histological appearances were normal (data not
shown). for the current studies, rab4 mutants were expressed at
approximately the same levels (fig. 1a) and did not affect
myocardial expression of other rabs (fig. 1 a), g proteins (fig.
1b), or  xxxg970xxx  (data not shown).
functional assays revealed a phenotype specific for rab4
inhibition. dominant inhibition of rab4 (s27n mice) diminished echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction by
16% and vcf by 22%, compared with  xxxd2741xxx  or q72l mice (fig.
1c and table 1). given that conscious echocardiography
induces a hyperadrenergic state, the consequences of infusing
the nonselective ␤ar agonist  xxxd2401xxx  were assessed by
invasive hemodynamics. left ventricular systolic function
(peak ⫹ dp兾dt) of both rab4 mutant mice was normal at
baseline but was diminished by ⬇25% at high  xxxd2401xxx 
doses in s27n mice (fig. 1c and table 1). there was no
difference in [125i]-cyanopindolol-binding capacity in rab4
transgenics (s27n ⫽ 21 ⫾ 2 fmol兾mg, q72l ⫽ 20 ⫾ 3
fmol兾mg; n ⫽ 3 for each) compared with  xxxd2741xxx  (23 ⫾ 2
fmol兾mg), suggesting that rab4 inhibition depressed inotropic
responsiveness to endogenous and exogenous ␤ar agonists
without altering the number of ␤ar.
because rab4 regulates endosomal sorting and recycling of
transferrin receptors (21, 22), we tested whether diminished
␤ar sensitivity of rab4 s27n hearts was from disruption of
␤ar trafficking and impaired accessibility to signaling effectors. ␤ar subcellular distribution was examined in rab4
mutant mouse hearts by crossbreeding with transgenic mice
overexpressing myocardial h-␤2ar as a marker. because
massive overexpression of h-␤2ar can cause a fibrotic cardiomyopathy (23, 24), attenuated mutant ␣-mhc promoters
(17) were used to achieve a low level of h-␤2ar expression
(18). immunoblotting of h-␤2ar transgenic myocardia detected h-␤2ar as a broad ⬇70-kda band accompanied by
higher molecular weight species previously identified as glycosylated forms (25) (fig. 2a). [125i]-cyanopindolol binding

(5%兾30%兾40%) sucrose gradients into light, medium, or

lipid-rich plasma membrane invaginations (26), was enriched
at the interface between the 5% and 30% gradients (fig. 2b,
fractions 3 and 4), whereas alkaline phosphatase (plasma
membranes) was at the 30 – 40% interface and clathrin was

enriched in the pellet (not shown). markers for golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, and lysosomes were in fractions 7–10 (data
not shown). h-␤2ar were located primarily in the heavier 40%
gradient fractions (fractions 7–10), although some also copurified with caveolin (fig. 2b). endogenous rab4, a marker for
recycling vesicles (16, 22), localized to fractions 7–10, whereas
 xxxg1915xxx  (fig. 2b) and transferrin receptor (not shown) marked
early endosomes (27, 28) at the interface between intermediate and heavy density gradients (fractions 6 and 7). as with
h-␤2ar, g␤ and the g␣s subunits of heterotrimeric g proteins were in heavier endosomal fractions of  xxxd2741xxx  mice (fig.
2c). g␣s had a broader distribution in h-␤2ar overexpressing
hearts, most likely because of its association with overexpressed receptors (fig. 2c).
the effects of agonists on subcellular distribution of h-␤2ar and
g protein effectors were assessed before and after 5-min infusion
of high-dose  xxxd2401xxx . agonist stimulation provoked receptor
translocation from heavier to lighter, caveolin-enriched fractions
(fig. 3a). in contrast, g␣s remained in the heavier fractions,
consistent with a previously postulated role for caveolar uncoupling

of ␤2ar from effectors (29). rab-specific effects on ␤2ar trafficking were assessed in q72l and s27n rab4 transgenic mice
crossbred with h-␤2ar overexpressors and compared with receptor translocation by  xxxd2401xxx  (fig. 3c, ␤2ar-35 and ␤2ar-35
⫹ iso). neither rab mutant affected the level of h-␤2ar overexpression (data not shown). however, dominant inhibition of rab4
(s27n) recapitulated agonist-induced subcellular redistribution
(fig. 3c, ␤2ar-35兾rab4s27n), and rab4 activation (q72l) resulted in accumulation of h-␤2ar in the lighter sucrose fractions
(fig. 3c, ␤2ar-35兾rab4q72l).
functional consequences of rab4-mediated ␤ar compartmentation were assessed. as previously reported (18, 23, 30),
h-␤2ar overexpression enhanced basal left ventricular systolic function (percent of fractional shortening and ⫹dp兾dt),
compared with  xxxd2741xxx  (compare tables 1 and 2). constitutive
activation of rab4 with the q72l mutant had no effect on
these parameters. in contrast, expression of inhibitory s27n
rab4 significantly depressed both inotropic indices (table 2).
together, these data show that inhibition of rab4 diminishes
␤2ar-mediated cardiac contractile function through redistribution of ␤ar in a manner analogous to that occurring after
agonist exposure. indeed, evidence of altered ␤ar trafficking
was v isualized by c onfocal microsc opy. in h- ␤ 2a roverexpressing mice representing the normal pattern of ␤2ar
compartmentation, there was highly defined labeling of sarcolemma and transverse tubular structures (fig. 4a), consistent with sarcolemmal localization (31). in contrast, rab4
s27n兾h-␤2ar cardiomyocytes exhibited granular cytoplasmic
staining and coarse labeling of sarcolemma and transverse
tubules, suggesting subsarcolemmal vesicular localization of
receptors (fig. 4 a). consistent with this notion, ultrastructural
examination revealed abnormal cytoplasmic and subsarcolemmal vesicular structures in compound rab4 s27n兾h-␤2ar
(fig. 4b) and rab4 s37n (data not shown) hearts, compared
to normal-appearing structures in  xxxd2741xxx , h-␤2ar, rab4 q72l兾
h-␤2ar (fig. 4b), and rab4 q72l (data not shown) hearts.
given that rab4 regulates receptor insertion into membranes (21, 22) and in vivo myocardial rab4 inhibition resulted
in ␤ar insensitivity, we hypothesized that myocardial rab4
mediates ␤ar recycling after agonist-mediated internalization (resensitization). therefore, we assayed in vivo cardiac
desensitization after 20 min of high-dose  xxxd2401xxx , and
measured time-dependent functional recovery. as in fig. 1b,
rab4 s27n mice had depressed responsiveness to  xxxd2401xxx , compared with  xxxd2741xxx  or rab4 q72l (fig. 5). corrected
for this basal abnormality, desensitization (percentage of
initial agonist response) was 49% and 62% in  xxxd2741xxx  and q72l
mice, respectively, but was complete (i.e., no agonist response)
in s27n. additionally, there was no significant resensitization
(normalization of agonist response) in s27n mice, versus
functional recovery after 30 min of 57% and 65% in  xxxd2741xxx  and
q72l mice, respectively. thus, the phenotype of myocardial
rab4 activation is ␤2ar translocation with normal function,
whereas that of rab4 inhibition is ␤2ar insensitivity because
of impaired receptor resensitization through defective receptor recycling.
discussion
these studies establish a necessary role for rab4-mediated
␤ar sarcolemmal targeting in cardiac adrenergic responsiveness and resensitization. depressed inotropic indices with
rab4 inhibition in the conscious, unsedated mouse suggest
that ␤ar internalization and reinsertion occur continuously
under physiological in vivo conditions. the combination of
grk-mediated receptor-effector uncoupling, ␤ -arrestinstimulated receptor internalization, and rab4-mediated resensitization therefore constitute a highly regulated mechaodley et al.

which eliminates potentially confounding effects of other
myocardial cell types. also, endogenous mouse ␤1ar and
␤2ar were not visualized by using the human receptorspecific antibody. compound h-␤2ar兾rab4 s27n mice revealed an association between functional inhibition and translocation of ␤2ar to caveolin-rich endosomal fractions. this
pattern of receptor trafficking recapitulated redistribution of
␤2ar with agonist, but was associated with loss of agonist
responsiveness and blunting of the hallmark intrinsic cardiac
activation of ␤2ar overexpression (23, 24). in contrast,
‘‘recycling activated’’ rab4 q72l兾h-␤2ar compound transgenic, exhibited normal ␤2ar responsiveness, and appropriate inotropic enhancement with h-␤2ar overexpression.
fig. 6 depicts our concept of rab4-mediated ␤ar trafficking in context of these phenotypes. although our use of
overexpressed receptors to track rab4-mediated trafficking
events has the potential to exaggerate uncoupled, or ‘‘spare’’
receptor effects, we suggest that activation of rab4 (fig. 6
upper, q72l) accelerates ␤ar reinsertion into plasma membranes where it functions normally. agonist stimulation causes
normal caveolar translocation and desensitization, but because
internalized receptors are rapidly reinserted, there is also rapid
resensitization. in contrast, inhibition of rab4 (fig. 6 lower,
s27n) prevents ␤ar recycling, causing receptor accumulation

nism for modulating myocardial adrenergic responsiveness
through adjustments of adrenergic receptor homeostasis.
to interrogate ␤ar trafficking in the in vivo heart, we
modified a rab small g protein thought to regulate receptor
movement from endosomes to plasma membranes (21, 22).
emerging data indicate that individual rab proteins control
distinct vesicular transport events in a highly specific manner
by binding to donor vesicles, facilitating transport, and modulating docking and fusion to targets (15, 32). expression in
cultured fibroblasts has shown that  xxxg1915xxx  regulates protein
internalization into early endosomes, whereas rab4 regulates
vesicular transport from endosomes to plasma membranes (27,
28). although rab1 transgenesis caused cardiomyopathy associated with disordered golgi (20) (consistent with rab1
regulation of transgolgi transport; see ref. 33), mutant rab4
mice showed no evidence of cardiac pathology, only diminished catecholamine-stimulated myocardial function with
rab4 inhibition.
to define ␤ar trafficking events that could account for
impaired cardiac function of rab4 s27n, we used antibodybased techniques and a low-expressing transgenic h-␤2ar
mouse (18). an advantage of combining the ␣mhc-driven
rab4 and h-␤2ar transgenic models is that receptors and
rab4 mutants were located exclusively in cardiac myocytes,

in caveolae and early endosomes, where receptors cannot
interact with g protein effectors, and adrenergic insensitivity.
agonist-mediated translocation of receptors to caveolae increases endosomal accumulation of receptors and reinforces
the phenotype by preventing resensitization.
independent of rab4 activity, our findings in h-␤2ar overexpressing hearts indicate that in vivo cardiac ␤2ar [like ␤1ar in
cultured cardiac myocytes (29)] colocalize with g␣s, rab4, and
 xxxg1915xxx  in plasma membranes and endosomes but translocate to
fractions enriched in caveolae within minutes of agonist simulation.
this finding is consistent with previously described agonist-induced
caveolar targeting of m2 muscarinic and kinin b1 receptors (34, 35)
but differs from prior descriptions of cardiomyocyte ␤2ar as being
located entirely in the caveolar-rich fractions of cultured neonatal

proteins. receptor internalization, presumably mediated by  xxxg1915xxx  (28), brings
␤ar to sorting vesicles (upper), where rab4 promotes their reinsertion into
sarcolemma. rab4 activation accelerates this process, constantly renewing the
supply of functional receptors (upper). rab4 inhibition (lower) impairs recycling, causing accumulation of uncoupled receptors in vesicles and caveolae.

rat cardiomyocytes (29, 31). although the h-␤2ar transgenic
model may, like any overexpression or transfection system, generate
nonphysiological results, other possible explanations for these differences include species differences between rodent and human
␤2ar, developmental differences between neonatal and adult
cardiomyocytes (25), the total absence of intrinsic catecholamine
stimulation and contractile activity in quiescent tissue culture, and
altered ␤2ar localization after enzymatic cardiomyocyte isolation
(25). reports of apparent caveolar egress of ␤2ar after agonist
stimulation in cultured cardiomyocytes (29), compared with our
observation of caveolar targeting of ␤2ar after  xxxd2401xxx 
stimulation in intact hearts, are more readily explained. the
prolonged (30-min) period of  xxxd2401xxx  exposure in the tissue
culture study likely induced receptor internalization (36), explaining the loss of receptors from caveolae.
in summary, these studies reveal a critical function for trafficking
of ␤2ar in maintaining normal myocardial responsiveness to
catecholamines and in promoting adrenergic resensitization after
sustained adrenergic stimulation. our data suggest that ␤ar
internalization and reexpression occur continuously to maintain
proper adrenergic responsiveness in the in vivo heart. given reports
of regulated rab protein expression in heart failure (20) and the
recently described existence of polymorphic human ␤ar exhibiting
abnormal receptor internalization or trafficking (␤1ar gly 49 and
␤2ar glu 27 and arg 16 variants) (37), these data support a
contributory role for altered ␤ar recycling in cardiomyopathic
syndromes.
