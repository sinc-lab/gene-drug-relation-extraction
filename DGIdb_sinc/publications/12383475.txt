abstract
we measured hepatic alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (agt) activity using capillary electrophoresis. after rat liver
homogenate was incubated in the presence of substrates and pyridoxal 59-phosphate, the pyruvate and glycine produced by
agt were measured. the agt activity was 10.0260.31 mmol pyruvate / h / mg protein and 10.2160.15 mmol glycine / h / mg
protein. this method is relatively simple and shows superior sensitivity, allowing the measurement of enzyme activity in 5
mg of protein. therefore, it appears to be suitable for laboratory use and may also have advantages for measuring agt
activity in liver biopsy specimens.

1. introduction
urinary oxalate plays an important role in the
formation of calcium oxalate stones, and an increase
of urinary oxalate excretion precipitates calcium
oxalate crystallization into stones in the urinary tract.
the principal source of urinary oxalate is endogenous biosynthesis and its immediate precursors are
ascorbate and glyoxylate [1]. under physiological
conditions, approximately 50–60% of urinary oxalate is derived from the endogenous metabolism of
glyoxylate [2,3]. glyoxylate is related to the metabolism of glycine and  xxxd2219xxx , and is enzymatically

interconvertible with these substances as well as
being partly transformable into oxalate [3–5].
alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (agt) is
quantitatively the most important enzyme catalyzing
transamination between alanine (an amino acid substrate) and glyoxylate (an alpha-keto acid substrate)
to form pyruvate and glycine. there are reports of
the measurement of agt activity and which expressed the rate of pyruvate production (unit: mmol
pyruvate / h / mg protein) from substrates (alanine and
glyoxylate) incubated with liver extract [6,7]. in an
earlier
procedure,
ldh / nadh-mediated
colorimetry was used for the determination of pyruvate [8–10], and, in another procedure, incubation
with l-[ 14 c]-alanine followed by high-voltage paper
electrophoretic separation of the radioactive pyruvate
was used [11]. however, these procedures are less
sensitive and more time-consuming. recently, a
high-performance liquid chromatographic procedure

with high sensitivity was also used for measurement
of agt activity [7,12], but it requires a large
quantity of specimen and buffer for analysis.
capillary electrophoresis is a powerful separation
technique that can achieve high resolution. various
capillary electrophoresis methods have been developed for the analysis of organic acids and amino
acids [13–15]. in our previous studies, we performed
oxalate and glyoxylate determination in urine and
liver specimens using capillary electrophoresis
[16,17]. the simplicity, high sensitivity, rapidity, and
the small quantity of specimen required of the
capillary method prompted us to employ it to
measure hepatic agt activity. in the present study,
we examined the suitability of the capillary electrophoresis technique for determining agt activity in
rat liver.

2. experimental

2.1. reagents
analytical reagent grade chemicals were used
throughout these experiments. glyoxylic acid monohydrate, sodium pyruvate, l-alanine, glycine, sucrose, and 1 n aqueous kh 2 po 4 solution were
purchased from wako (japan), and pyridoxal 59phosphate was obtained from sigma–aldrich
(japan). potassium phosphate buffer (ph 8.0, 0.2
mol / l) was prepared weekly. glyoxylate, pyruvate,
alanine, and glycine were dissolved in water to make
stock standard solutions (100 mmol / l) that were
stored at 220 8c, and working solutions were
prepared daily. deionized-purified water from a
milli-q water purification system (nihon millipore,
japan) was used for dilution.

2.2. liver specimens
six male wistar rats weighing 250–300 g were fed
standard laboratory chow and had free access to tap
water. the liver was removed from each rat under
anesthesia with  xxxd2052xxx , and a liver specimen
(10 mg) was immediately homogenized at 4 8c in
400 ml of a buffer that contained 100 mmol / l
potassium phosphate (ph 8.0) and 250 mmol / l
sucrose. the homogenate was centrifuged at 4 8c for

10 min at 11 000 r.p.m., and protein in the supernatant was quantified using an ultraviolet (uv) spectrophotometer by reading the absorbance at 280 nm
with bovine  xxxg124xxx  as the standard.

2.3. enzyme reaction
the reaction solution for measuring agt activity
was prepared according to petrarulo et al. [7] with
some modifications. a 25 ml aliquot of homogenate
supernatant was incubated at 37 8c in the presence of
10.0 mmol / l glyoxylate, 80.0 mmol / l alanine, 100
mmol / l potassium phosphate (ph 8.0), and 100
mmol / l pyridoxal 59-phosphate in a final volume of
281 ml. the enzymatic reaction was initiated by
adding alanine after prewarming the solutions at 37
8c for 5 min. after 30 min, agt activity was
arrested by heating at 95 8c for 10 min and the
pyruvate and glycine levels generated in the reaction
solution were measured. enzyme and substrate
blanks were prepared for each specimen by replacing
either glyoxylate, alanine, or liver extract with an
equal volume of water in the reaction mixture.

2.4. capillary electrophoresis
the reaction solution was deproteinized using an
ultrafree c3 thk filter, and was diluted 20-fold
with water. specimens (|20 nl) were injected at 50
mbar for 4.0–6.0 s. pyruvate and glyoxylate were
separated using an organic buffer containing 5 mm
pyridinedicarboxylic acid and 0.5 mm cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (ph 5.6; agilent technologies, germany) and a capillary electrophoresis
system (hewlett-packard 3d ce, germany) running
at a constant voltage of 230 kv at 30 8c. the
capillary tube was coated internally with polyimide
fused silica and had a total length of 80.5 cm (72 cm
effective length) with an internal diameter of 75 mm
(yokogawa analytical systems, japan). in contrast,
glycine and alanine were separated using a basic
anion buffer containing 20 mm 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid and 0.5 mm hexadesyl trimethylammonium hydroxide (ph 12.1; agilent technologies) and a capillary tube of 120.5 cm total
length (104 cm effective length). the target substances were detected by indirect uv detection using
a diode-array detector with the signal at 350 nm and

s. nishijima et al. / j. chromatogr. b 780 (2002) 13–19

the reference at 200 nm. each determination required
about 14 min, followed by washing the capillary tube
with the same buffer at 50 mbar for 4 min. standard
solutions of pyruvate ranging from 11.4 mmol / l to
22.7 mmol / l (11 different concentrations) and solutions of glycine ranging from 66.6 mmol / l to 26.7
mmol / l (10 different concentrations) were measured
in triplicate, and the standard curve constructed from
the results was used for the analysis of liver specimens.

2.5. statistical analysis
results are reported as the mean6standard deviation (sd). student’s unpaired t-test was used for
statistical analysis, with significance being set at
p,0.05.

3. results
a standard mixture containing pyruvate, glyoxylate, glycine, and alanine (1 mmol / l each) was

15

injected and separated by capillary electrophoresis.
the migration time was 4.5 min for pyruvate and 4.7
min for glyoxylate in the organic buffer (ph 5.6),
while it was 11.5 min for glycine and 12.5 min for
alanine in the basic anion buffer (ph 12.1) (fig. 1a
and b). standard curves for pyruvate and glycine (y:
absorbance of the peak area, versus x: concentration)
were plotted over the range from 11.4 mmol / l to
22.7 mmol / l of pyruvate and from 66.6 mmol / l to
26.7 mmol / l of glycine. the regression lines for
these plots were linear and each had a significant
regression coefficient (pyruvate, y 5 1.06x, r 5
0.999, p,0.01; glycine, y 5 0.18x, r 5 0.999, p,
0.01). the minimum detection limit for pyruvate and
glycine was 22.7 and 133.3 mmol / l, respectively, in
either standard solution or liver specimen (signal-tonoise ratio 2).
in electropherograms of liver specimens separated
using the organic buffer (ph 5.6), the pyruvate peak
was sharp and it was considered to be specific for
pyruvate because there were no other peaks close
enough to cause interference. also, the peak increased in height after the addition of standard

during the measurement of agt activity, pyruvate and glycine levels increased as a function of
both the incubation time (fig. 4) and the amount of

liver protein (fig. 5). therefore, it was possible to
measure enzyme activity even in specimens containing only 5 mg of protein. agt activity of liver
specimens in the presence of substrates and pyridoxal 59-phosphate was 10.0260.31 mmol pyruvate / h /
mg protein and 10.2160.15 mmol glycine / h / mg
protein, respectively. the generation of pyruvate and

glycine after incubation of specimens containing

correlation (y 5 1.12x, r 5 0.991, p,0.01) (fig. 6).
no pyruvate or glycine peaks were detected when
liver specimens were incubated without either
alanine or glyoxylate. in addition, pyruvate and
glycine were generated at a lower level in media
with both alanine and glyoxylate incubated without
any liver specimen, although their levels were negligible and stayed constant without being influenced
by incubation time (fig. 4).

4. discussion
capillary electrophoresis is a powerful separation
technique that can achieve high resolution. various
capillary electrophoresis methods have been developed for the analysis of organic acids and amino
acids. since both organic acids and amino acids have
little or no uv absorbance, indirect uv detection is
generally utilized for their determination by capillary
electrophoresis [14]. in the process of capillary
electrophoresis, a specimen injected into the anode
pole is moved towards the cathode pole, and substances are separated according to their different
migration times. the electrolytes used for the separation and detection of organic acids and amino acids
contain cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (ctab)
or cetyltrimethylammonium hydroxide (ctah) to

reverse the electroosmotic flow and to ensure the
elution of anions through the detector. in particular,
for the detection of amino acids, a high ph is used to
ensure that anions are formed by all compounds and
to promote migration toward the anode. at ph .12,
amino acids are all anionic, since their isoelectric
points range from 2.98 to 10.76. with the indirect
uv detection method, displacement of a highly uvabsorbing electrolyte by the target anion creates a
negative peak. all wavelengths from 190 to 600 nm
can be detected by diode-array detection, and conversion of the negative peaks to positive peaks is
achieved by switching the absorbances measured at
the signal and reference wavelengths. the concentration of uv-absorbing substance in the electrolyte
and the detection wavelength are selected to maximize the uv absorbance and to minimize noise. the
advantage of indirect detection is that it is a universal
method, which allows the identification of ions
without any specific absorbance. when special buffers were used in the present study, there were no
other substances close enough to interfere with the
pyruvate or glycine peaks in the electropherograms
[14,15], so the respective peaks were considered to
be specific for each substance. mass spectrometric
confirmation of the peaks may be needed for definitive determination, but this method appears to be
applicable for routine laboratory use.
using capillary electrophoresis, agt activity detected in normal rat liver (10.0260.31 mmol pyruvate / h / mg protein) was comparable to that in normal human liver reported by petrarulo et al.
(10.962.0 mmol pyruvate / h / mg protein) [7]. agt
activity has been defined as the rate of pyruvate
production during incubation of a mixture of tissue
extract and substrates [6–11]. however, agt catalyzes transamination between alanine and glyoxylate,
and glycine is also subsequently produced by transamination between them. therefore, glycine production also reflects the net agt activity in the liver.
in the present study, both pyruvate and glycine
produced by agt were measured and were shown to
increase in parallel with each other, so the measurement of either substance can be used to assess agt
activity.
in the absence of agt (liver specimen), pyruvate
and glycine were still detected at low levels. rowsell

et al. [9] observed that a mixture of alanine and
glutamate (both at 24 mmol / l) in 60 mmol / l of
phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) promoted the formation of
a-ketoglutarate at a rate of 22–25 mmol / l / h at 37
8c. spontaneous transamination between alanine and
glyoxylate was also reported to occur at a low level
in the presence of higher substrate concentrations.
therefore, these findings might be caused by a
highly favorable driving force for the amination of
glyoxylate [18].
agt activity has been detected by various techniques [6–11]. compared with other methods, capillary electrophoresis has high sensitivity and requires
a very small amount of specimen and electrolyte
volume for analysis. in the present study, capillary
electrophoresis allowed the measurement of the
enzyme activity even in 5 mg of protein within 30
min of incubation, while at least 10 mg of protein or
more is required for analysis by the enzyme spectrophotometric method or the high-performance liquid
chromatographic method [7,10]. moreover, this procedure has superior simplicity, in that specimens can
be analyzed with only deproteinization and dilution
[9,14], and it provides excellent reproducibility and
good linearity. therefore, capillary electrophoresis
may be useful for measuring agt activity when the
amount of tissue is limited such as with small human
liver biopsy specimens, and it seems to be suitable
for laboratory use.
