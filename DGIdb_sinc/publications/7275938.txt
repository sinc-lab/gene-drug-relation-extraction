mechanism of thiamine-induced respiratory deficiency in saccharomyces carlsbergensis.  cells of saccharomyces carlsbergensis 4228 grown aerobically with added thiamine (1 microgram .  xxxg1167xxx ) in a  xxxd3049xxx -free medium contained no detectable heme precursors, such as delta- xxxd148xxx ,  xxxd1749xxx , or  xxxd3037xxx . the deficiency in heme precursors in the thiamine-grown cells was accompanied by previously reported phenomena, i.e., growth depression,  xxxd3049xxx  deficiency, and respiratory deficiency due to a marked decrease in the activities of heme-containing enzymes and cytochrome level (i. nakamura et al., febs lett. 62: 354-358, 1976). it has been reported that all of the effects of thiamine are abolished by adding pyridoxine to the medium. delta- xxxd148xxx  was found to have quite similar effects to those of pyridoxine, except that growth was partially improved by delta- xxxd148xxx , whereas it was fully restored by pyridoxine. incubation of the thiamine-grown cells with delta- xxxd148xxx  resulted in the appearance of the heme precursors and the heme-containing enzymes. consistent with the lowered amount of  xxxd3049xxx , the thiamine-grown cells had a lowered activity of delta- xxxd148xxx  synthase, a  xxxd3047xxx -dependent enzyme. not only the holoenzyme activity but also the apoenzyme activity was very low in these cells. these results indicate that the thiamine-induced  xxxd3049xxx  deficiency brings about the decrease in delta- xxxd148xxx  synthase activity, which leads to heme deficiency and therefore to respiratory deficiency.
