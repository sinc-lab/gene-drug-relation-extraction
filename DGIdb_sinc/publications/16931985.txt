background: nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents
(nmbas) are extensively used in the practice of anesthesia and
intensive care medicine. their primary site of action is at the
postsynaptic  xxxg456xxx  (nachr) in the
neuromuscular junction, but their action on neuronal nachrs
have not been fully evaluated. furthermore, observed adverse
effects of nondepolarizing nmbas might originate from an interaction with neuronal nachrs. the aim of this study was to
examine the effect of clinically used nondepolarizing nmbas on
muscle and neuronal nachr subtypes.
methods: xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with messenger rna encoding for the subunits included in the human
␣1␤1␧␦, ␣3␤2, ␣3␤4, ␣4␤2, and ␣7 nachr subtypes. the interactions between each of these nachr subtypes and atracurium,
cisatracurium,  xxxd3456xxx ,  xxxd2658xxx , pancuronium,
rocuronium, and vecuronium were studied using an eight-channel two-electrode voltage clamp setup. responses were measured as peak current and net charge.
results: all nondepolarizing nmbas inhibited both muscle
and neuronal nachrs. the neuronal nachrs were reversibly
and concentration-dependently inhibited in the low micromolar range. the mechanism (i.e., competitive vs. noncompetitive)
of the block at the neuronal nachrs was dependent both on
subtype and the nmba tested. the authors did not observe
activation of the nachr subtypes by any of the nmbas tested.
conclusions: the authors conclude that nondepolarizing
nmbas concentration-dependently inhibit human neuronal
nachrs. the inhibition of the presynaptic ␣3␤2 nachr subtype
expressed at the motor nerve ending provides a possible molecular explanation for the tetanic and train-of-four fade seen
during a nondepolarizing neuromuscular block.

intubation and mechanical ventilation and to improve
surgical conditions.
although it is well established that nondepolarizing
nmbas block the postsynaptic ␣1␤1␧␦  xxxg456xxx  (nachr) subtype at the muscle endplate, the effect on the presynaptic motor nerve ending
has not been clarified (for a review, see vizi and lendvai1,2 and bowman et al.2). it is believed that the mechanism behind tetanic and train-of-four (tof) fade during
neuromuscular block by a nondepolarizing nmba arise
from an interaction with presynaptic cholinergic autoreceptors at the motor nerve ending.1,3 however, the
affinity of nondepolarizing nmbas to such presynaptic
autoreceptors has not been investigated at the molecular
level. further, it has recently been shown that an inhibition of the presynaptic ␣3␤2 nachr subtype at the
motor nerve end4 induces tetanic fade.5 based on this, it
seems likely that the tetanic fade phenomenon seen
during nondepolarizing neuromuscular block is due to
an inhibition of the ␣3␤2 nachr subtype.
the ␣1␤1␧␦ and the ␣3␤2 nachrs are members of the
same neurotransmitter-gated ion channel superfamily.
they are composed of five transmembrane subunits with
a central cation pore, and the stoichiometry and identity
of subunits determines each receptor’s unique properties.6 to date, 17 nicotinic subunits have been cloned in
vertebrates: the muscle ␣1, ␤1, ␦, ␥, and ␧ subunits and
the neuronal ␣2–10 and ␤2– 4 subunits.7 although there
are many potential combinations of neuronal nachrs,
only a few have as yet been found to be of biologic
importance.8,9 the neuronal nachrs are found both
presynaptically and postsynaptically in neurons of the
central (␣4␤2, ␣3␤2, ␣7)9,10 and peripheral nervous system (␣3␤4, ␣3␤2, ␣7)9,11,12 as well as in extraneuronal
tissues and cells, such as keratinocytes, muscle, lymphocytes, macrophages, carotid bodies, and neurosecretory
cells.6,7,13
interactions between nmbas and neuronal nachrs
may cause serious cardiovascular and respiratory side
effects. it has been shown that nondepolarizing nmbas
reduce hypoxic ventilatory response in partially paralyzed humans,14,15 and the mechanism behind this depression might be interference with nicotinic chemotransduction of the carotid bodies.16,17 at the molecular
level,  xxxd3456xxx , pancuronium, atracurium, and its
degradation product laudanosine have been shown to

block neuronal nachr subtypes expressed in xenopus
oocytes.18 –22 interestingly, some reports indicate that
nmbas can act as partial agonists at ␣1␤1␥␦, ␣3␤4, and
␣4␤2 nachr subtypes21,23; however, other studies could
not demonstrate any agonism by nmbas.20,24
the ␣7 nachr subtype plays a key role in the cholinergic reflex involved in inflammatory conditions such as
sepsis,25,26 and it can be speculated whether nmbas
used in intensive care settings might interact with the
inflammatory response to sepsis. furthermore, although
highly charged, nmbas can under certain conditions
cross the blood– brain barrier,27–29 thus having the potential to interact with central cholinergic receptors and
the synaptic transmission30 and cause seizures.31,32
because most nondepolarizing nmbas were developed before cloning and isolation of their target proteins, the precise modes of action have not been examined in detail. a better understanding of the molecular
mechanisms of action of clinically used nondepolarizing
nmbas on human neuronal nachr subtypes is needed.
in addition, for future drug design, it is essential to define
potential interactions with human neuronal nachrs.
the aim of this study was therefore to investigate the
potency and functional affinity of clinically used nondepolarizing nmbas on acetylcholine-induced responses
on human muscle and neuronal nachrs heterologously
expressed in xenopus oocytes. in addition, potential
activation of nachrs by nondepolarizing nmbas was
also investigated.

materials and methods
clones
the human nachr subunits ␣1, ␣3– 4, ␣7, ␤1, ␤2, ␤4, ␦,
and ␧ were cloned from a human complementary dna
(cdna) library. genbank (bethesda, md) access numbers for the cdna nucleotide sequences are as follows:
nm 000079 (␣1), hsu62432 (␣3), l35901 (␣4), y08420
(␣7), nm 000747 (␤1), y08415 (␤2), nm 000750 (␤4),
nm 000751 (␦), and nm 000080 (␧). the cdnas were
subcloned into different expression vectors, pkgem (astrazeneca, wilmington, de) (␣1, ␣3, ␤1, ␤2, ␦ and ␧),
pbluescript ii sk (⫺) (stratagene, la jolla, ca) (␣7), and
pbsta (university of california, irvine, ca) (␣4 and ␤4).
messenger rna (mrna) was transcribed in vitro using
the mmessage mmachine® t7 kit (ambion, austin, tx)
and analyzed using a bioanalyzer (agilent technologies,
palo alto, ca).
xenopus oocyte injection
the study was approved by the local animal ethics
committee at karolinska institutet, stockholm, sweden.
preparation and injection of oocytes and the electrophysiologic recordings were conducted as previously
described.33 briefly, xenopus laevis oocytes were isoanesthesiology, v 105, no 3, sep 2006

jonsson et al.

lated by partial ovariectomy from frogs anesthetized
with 0.2% tricaine (sigma, st. louis, mo). the ovaries
were mechanically dissected to smaller lumps and digested in or-2 buffer (82.5 mm nacl, 2 mm kcl, 1 mm
mgcl2, 5 mm hepes, ph adjusted to 7.5 with naoh)
containing 1.5 mg/ml collagenase (type 1a; sigma) for
90 min to remove the follicular epithelia from the oocytes. after 1–24 h, the oocytes were injected with
0.2–18 ng mrna in a total volume of 30 – 40 nl/oocyte.
multiple subunit combinations were injected at a 1:1
ratio (␣1␤1␧␦ or ␣x␤y), except for ␣4␤2, where the injection ratio was 1:9. the oocytes were maintained in
leibovitz l-15 medium (sigma) diluted 1:1 with millipore
filtered double distilled h2o (billerica, ma) and 80 ␮g/ml
gentamicin, 100 u/ml penicillin, and 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin added. oocytes were incubated at 18°–19°c for
2–7 days after injection before being studied.
electrophysiologic recordings
all recordings were performed at room temperature
(20°–22°c). during recording, the oocytes were continuously perfused with nd-96 (96.0 mm nacl, 2.0 mm kcl,
1.8 mm cacl2, 1.0 mm mgcl2, 5.0 mm hepes, ph 7.4
adjusted with naoh). oocyte recordings were performed using an integrated system that provides automated impalement of up to eight oocytes, studied in
parallel with two-electrode voltage clamp, and current
measurements were automatically coordinated with
fluid delivery throughout the experiment (opusxpress
6000a; molecular devices, union city, ca). electrodes
were made from 1.5-mm borosilicate tubes (world precision instruments inc., sarasota, fl) and filled with 3 m
kcl (0.5–2.5 m⍀ resistance). the oocytes were voltage
clamped at ⫺60 mv, because it has previously been
shown that inhibition of nachrs by nondepolarizing
nmbas is voltage independent at holding voltages from
⫺100 to ⫺40 mv.20,23
protocol
oocytes were continuously perfused with nd-96 at a rate
of 2 ml/min in a 150-␮l chamber. drugs were delivered
from a 96-well plate using disposable tips and administered
at a rate of 2 ml/min for the first 2 s, and thereafter at 1
ml/min. concentration–response curves for acetylcholine
were constructed, before and after the addition of 10 ␮m
antagonist in each oocyte, for the neuronal nachrs. to
determine whether nondepolarizing nmbas activate and
furthermore inhibit acetylcholine-induced currents, nondepolarizing nmbas were applied for 55 s before a 20-s
coapplication of both antagonist and acetylcholine. two
different concentrations of acetylcholine were applied on
each neuronal receptor subtype. the concentrations 1 and
10 ␮m (for ␣4␤2), 50 and 300 ␮m (for ␣3␤2 and ␣3␤4), and
30 and 100 ␮m (for ␣7) were chosen to represent concentrations below and above the ec50 for each receptor subtype. the muscle nachr (␣1␤1␧␦) was used as a reference,

muscle relaxants inhibit neuronal nicotinic receptors

and therefore only one acetylcholine concentration (10
␮m) was studied. between each drug application, there was
a 6-min washout period to allow clearance of the drugs and
to avoid desensitization of the channels. before and after
each concentration–response experiment, three control
responses were recorded at ec50 acetylcholine concentration to exclude desensitization. experiments were rejected
if the postcontrol response was less than 80% of the precontrol response. to adjust for the level of channel expression, the responses in acetylcholine concentration–response experiments were normalized to the peak response
in each individual oocyte. for inhibition experiments, responses in each oocyte were normalized to the mean of the
second and third acetylcholine precontrols.
drugs
acetylcholine and  xxxd3456xxx  were purchased
from sigma. atracurium and cisatracurium were provided by glaxosmithkline (barnard castle durham,
united kingdom).  xxxd2658xxx  ( xxxd2658xxx ®) was purchased from glaxosmithkline (mölndal, sweden). org
nc 97 (pancuronium), org nc 45 (vecuronium), and
rocuronium were provided by organon (bh oss, the
netherlands). chemicals used in buffers were purchased
from sigma unless otherwise stated. stock solution of
1mm acetylcholine in nd-96 was prepared and frozen.
nondepolarizing nmbas were prepared fresh each day
and stored at ⫹4°c. all drugs were then diluted in nd-96
immediately before use.
data analysis and statistics
off-line analyses were made using clampfit 9.2 (molecular devices). changes in currents were studied both as
peak and net charge responses (area under the curve);
however, for the ␣7 subtype, only net charge analysis
was used, as previously described.33–35 the baseline
current immediately before drug application was subtracted from the response, and the analysis region for
peak and net charge analysis was 20 s, i.e., during the
time of agonist application. concentration–response relations for acetylcholine were fitted by nonlinear regression (prism 4.0; graphpad, san diego, ca) to the fourparameter logistic equation

where y is the normalized response, x is the logarithm of

results
acetylcholine concentration–response relations for
muscular and neuronal nachrs
acetylcholine produced a concentration-dependent inward current in voltage clamped oocytes injected with
mrna encoding muscle- and neuronal-type nachrs,
whereas uninjected oocytes did not respond to acetylcholine (data not shown). the responses to acetylcholine in terms of kinetics and ec50 values at the nachr
subtypes were consistent with previous reports18,33,36
(fig. 1 and table 1), thus confirming the receptor expression model. however, kinetics can also be determined
using net charge analysis. unfortunately, there is a lack
of published data for comparison of net charge in human
nachrs, except for the ␣7 nachr subtype.35 as shown
in figure 1, at ␣3␤4 and ␣4␤2 nachr concentration–
response relations based on net charge analysis correlate
well with peak currents, with almost identical ec50 and
hill coefficients (appendix 1). however, the ␣7 subtype
nachr displays unique properties, with very fast desensitization kinetics (fig. 1a), which gives a different concentration–response relation depending on whether
peak response or net charge was measured (appendix
1). at the ␣3␤2 subtype, which has an initial rapid desensitization, there was a small difference between the
ec50 values.
inhibition of muscle nachrs by nondepolarizing
nmbas
because the adult muscle (␣1␤1␧␦) nachr is the clinical target for nondepolarizing nmbas, this receptor
subtype was used as reference in the oocyte setup.
atracurium, cisatracurium,  xxxd3456xxx ,  xxxd2658xxx ,
pancuronium, rocuronium, and vecuronium all concentration-dependently inhibited 10 ␮m acetylcholine–induced currents in oocytes expressing the human ␣1␤1␧␦
nachr (fig. 2 and table 2). the ic50 values were in the
nanomolar range and were comparable with a similar

mouse crna.37

showed similar affinity at the ␣3␤2 nachr subtype, with
ic50 values of 3–20 ␮m after activation by 50 ␮m acetylcholine and 1– 62 ␮m at 300 ␮m acetylcholine. vecuronium and  xxxd3456xxx  were most potent as inhibitors
at the ␣3␤2 subtype independent of acetylcholine concentration, whereas  xxxd2658xxx  had the lowest potency
of all the nondepolarizing nmbas and did not reduce the
300-␮m acetylcholine response at concentrations lower
than 100 ␮m. for atracurium, cisatracurium, pancuronium, and rocuronium, an increase from 50 to 300 ␮m
acetylcholine slightly increased the ic50 (not significant),
suggesting a competitive inhibition or higher affinity to
the closed channel. nondepolarizing nmbas tended to
increase the acetylcholine ec50 for the ␣3␤2 nachr,
anesthesiology, v 105, no 3, sep 2006

although the effect was not statistically significant. the
peak acetylcholine current was not reduced by 10 ␮m
nondepolarizing nmbas (fig. 1). therefore, the inhibition induced by nmbas at the ␣3␤2 receptor seems
mainly to be competitive, except for  xxxd3456xxx  and
vecuronium, where there is a noncompetitive component.
all of the nondepolarizing nmbas concentration-dependently inhibited the ␣3␤4 nachr subtype, with ic50
values from 2 to 20 ␮m and from 0.3 to 2 ␮m for 50 and
300 ␮m acetylcholine, respectively. there was no component of competitive inhibition by the nmbas at this
receptor because the ic50 values were unchanged, or
even lower, at the higher acetylcholine concentration

by contrast, the ␣4␤2 nachr subtype was competitively blocked by most of the nmbas. that is, increasing
the concentrations of acetylcholine from 1 to 10 ␮m
increased the ic50 from 1–13 ␮m to 5– 67 ␮m. in addition,
nmbas generally right-shifted the acetylcholine concentration–response relations without reducing the peak
response at the ␣4␤2 nachr (fig. 1), further suggesting a
competitive mode of inhibition. however, 10 ␮m rocuronium significantly reduced the peak response to all
concentrations of acetylcholine tested (fig. 1), and thus,
its inhibition is noncompetitive. further, rocuronium
seemed to desensitize the ␣4␤2 receptor because the
control responses after both the acetylcholine concentration–response experiment with rocuronium and after
the rocuronium inhibition experiment with 10 ␮m acetylcholine did not return to 80% of the control response
in most of the series, which were therefore excluded
(see material and methods, protocol). interestingly, rocuronium inhibition experiments with 1 ␮m acetylcholine
did not show this pattern. rocuronium therefore inhibits
the ␣3␤4 and ␣4␤2 subtypes noncompetitively and with
variable state dependency.38
all nmbas concentration-dependently right-shifted the
acetylcholine concentration–response curve for the ␣7
nachr subtype, with increased ec50 values (table 1), but
did not reduce peak responses (not significant). in genanesthesiology, v 105, no 3, sep 2006

eral, the inhibition of 30 and 100 ␮m acetylcholine at the
␣7 nachr subtype by nmbas was concentration dependent (table 2), suggesting that nmbas inhibit the ␣7
nachr subtype in a competitive manner. however, for
rocuronium, the ic50 decreased with increased acetylcholine concentration (table 2), indicating a noncompetitive component in the action of rocuronium at the ␣7
nachr subtype.

rocuronium, or vecuronium to oocytes expressing human muscle (␣1␤1␧␦) or neuronal (␣3␤2, ␣3␤4, ␣4␤2, and
␣7) nachrs did not result in receptor activation (data
not shown).

discussion
this study shows that nondepolarizing nmbas inhibit
neuronal nachrs and that the inhibitory mechanism
differs between individual receptor subtypes and
nmbas. in addition, we found no evidence that the
nachr subtypes tested were activated by any of the
nondepolarizing nmbas.

muscle relaxants inhibit neuronal nicotinic receptors

fig. 3. representative traces of vecuronium-induced inhibition
of acetylcholine (ach) currents in xenopus oocytes expressing
the human ␣3␤2, ␣3␤4, ␣4␤2, and ␣7 nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor subtypes. vecuronium (vec) was preapplied for 55 s
before a 20-s coapplication with acetylcholine as indicated with
the horizontal bars. for each receptor subtype, traces shown in
each row are from the same oocyte.

all the nondepolarizing nmbas reversibly and concentration-dependently inhibited the neuronal ␣3␤2, ␣3␤4,
␣4␤2, and ␣7 nachr subtypes in the micromolar range.
hence, the block occurs at clinically relevant concentrations.39 in general, nondepolarizing nmbas block the
␣4␤2, ␣3␤2, and ␣7 subtypes in a competitive manner;
the exception is the ␣3␤4 subtype, where the block
seems noncompetitive. however, the nondepolarizing
nmbas have individual action profiles on different receptors.  xxxd2658xxx  had rather low potency at the ␣3␤2
nachr, whereas the other nmbas showed similar ic50
values across the nachrs tested.
nondepolarizing nmbas have higher functional affinity for the ␣1␤1␧␦ nachr subtype than for the neuronal
nachr subtypes, as determined by current amplitude
measurements. for the muscle nachr, the ic50 values
(nanomolar range) presented here as well as in other
studies using the xenopus oocyte expression system20,23,37 contrast with the micromolar concentrations
of nmbas needed to reduce the nerve-evoked twitch by
50% in isolated rat nerve-muscle preparations40 and in
the clinical setting.39 this apparent discrepancy probaanesthesiology, v 105, no 3, sep 2006

527

bly reflects the large safety factor in the neuromuscular
transmission, where approximately 75% of the receptors
must be occupied by a nondepolarizing nmba before
there is any reduction in twitch tension, and 90% occupancy is required for full paralysis.41 this safety factor
has not been reported for the neuronal nachrs as far as
we know.
in addition to inhibiting nachrs, nondepolarizing
nmbas have also been described as partial agonists at
both muscle and neuronal nachr subtypes.21,23,32 atracurium-induced activation of the ␣4␤2 nachr subtype
occurs at very low concentrations, even lower than
those required for inhibition.21 however, the reports are
contradictory, because garland et al.20 were unable to
show any activation of the ␣1␤1␥␦ or ␣1␤1␧␦ nachr
subtype induced by  xxxd3456xxx  or pancuronium.
here, we did not observe activation of the nachrs by
any of the seven nondepolarizing nmbas studied. one
possible explanation for this discrepancy might be that
our study, in contrast to the previous one,21 did not use
atropine in the perfusion buffer. a low concentration of
atropine (i.e., 0.5 ␮m) has commonly been used to prevent activation of putative endogenous muscarinic receptors at the epithelial layer of the xenopus oocyte
surface.42,43 however, during recent years, it has become clear that there is no endogenous surface expression of muscarinic receptors in xenopus oocytes themselves,44 and furthermore, it has been shown that
atropine can both inhibit and activate nachr expressed
in the xenopus oocyte.44 notably, the ␣4␤2 subtype is
activated by atropine; therefore, we suggest that the
activation of the ␣4␤2 subtype previously attributed to
atracurium might instead have been elicited by atropine.
for the muscle-type nachr, we could not record any
activation of the ␣1␤1␧␦ nachr subtype, thus confirming observations reported in previous studies.20,23,24
many of the nondepolarizing nmbas tested have
breakdown products with potential to block muscle
nachrs39; however, most of the nondepolarizing
nmbas are not degraded in vitro. atracurium and cisatracurium can to some extent undergo spontaneous degradation to laudanosine by hofmann reaction in vitro,45
depending mainly on temperature and ph, and although
we controlled these parameters, we cannot exclude
some contamination of laudanosine. laudanosine has
been shown to block the neuronal ␣3␤4, ␣4␤2, and ␣7 in
a noncompetitive manner with ic50 values of 8 –38
␮m.21,22 because both atracurium and cisatracurium inhibit the ␣4␤2 and ␣7 nachrs in a competitive way, we
consider it unlikely that there is any substantial involvement of laudanosine under our experimental conditions.
to date, only one study investigating the effect of
clinically used nondepolarizing nmbas on nachrs has
used human dna21; all of the others have used rat and
mouse dna.20,24,37 although there is more than 80%
homology between the human and rodent nachr sub-

neuromuscular blocking agents (nmbas)
in human ␣3␤2, ␣3␤4, ␣4␤2, and ␣7  xxxg456xxx  expressed in
xenopus oocytes. for each receptor subtype, two acetylcholine concentrations
were applied, one lower and one higher
than the ec50: 50 and 300 ␮m for ␣3␤2 and
␣3␤4, 1 and 10 ␮m for ␣4␤2, and 30 and
100 ␮m for ␣7. control acetylcholine peak

unit dna,6 a small difference in amino acid sequence
can cause significant changes in biophysical and pharmacologic properties of the receptors.18 therefore, we
believe that our study directly comparing the effect of
the clinically used nmbas at the human receptors in the
same system adds to the current knowledge on basic
pharmacologic properties of nondepolarizing nmbas.
the mechanisms of the block of neuromuscular transmission by nondepolarizing nmbas are likely dual; the
most important is a postsynaptic block at the ␣1␤1␧␦
nachr subtype, but there is also an inhibition of presynaptic cholinergic receptors.2,3,46 it has become evident
that the tetanic and tof fade phenomena induced by
nondepolarizing relaxants most likely arise from a block
anesthesiology, v 105, no 3, sep 2006

of the presynaptic ␣3␤2 nicotinic receptor.1,2,5 interestingly, recent data indicate that adenosine and adenosine
triphosphate interacting with purinergic receptors also
are important in mobilization and release of acetylcholine from the motor nerve ending.47,48 here, we can for
the first time show that clinically used nondepolarizing
nmbas inhibit the ␣3␤2 nachr subtype in the micromolar concentration range, thus providing a molecular explanation for the tetanic and tof fade seen during neuromuscular blockade by nondepolarizing nmbas.
however,  xxxd2658xxx , which had a lower affinity for the
␣3␤2 nachr, nonetheless elicited fade, indicated that a
block of the ␣3␤2 nachr is probably not the only mechanism behind tetanic and tof fade. the reduction in

muscle relaxants inhibit neuronal nicotinic receptors

peak tension and tof fade seen during neuromuscular
monitoring are likely caused by two separate events,1–
3,46 namely the presynaptic and the postsynaptic inhibition by nondepolarizing nmbas. this also explains the
clinical observations that nondepolarizing nmbas differ
in the degree of twitch reduction versus tetanic and tof
fade.49 furthermore, animal studies of the twitch tension
and tetanic fade clearly show that these events are due to
two separate mechanisms. hexamethonium produced a
complete tetanic fade without any twitch depression;
pancuronium produced tetanic fade in doses that also
produced pronounced twitch depression; ␣-bungarotoxin did not produce tetanic fade but elicited a pronounced twitch depression.50 comparing this study to
our results, it is clear that nondepolarizing nmbas have
a much higher affinity for the ␣1␤1␧␦ nachr subtype
compared with the ␣3␤2 subtype, but still, the ic50
values for the ␣3␤2 nachr subtype are in a clinically
relevant range and furthermore correspond roughly to
the concentrations that produce a 50% neuromuscular
block in in vitro animal experiments (1.68 –12.3
␮m).40,50 in addition, we have recently shown that succinylcholine, which does not produce tetanic or tof
fade at normal dosage, does not block the ␣3␤2 nachr
subtype at clinically relevant concentrations.33 the fact
that nondepolarizing nmbas do block the ␣3␤2 nachr
subtype in clinically relevant concentrations, and the
fact that succinylcholine does not, strongly support the
concept that the clinically observed tetanic and tof
fade are due to a block of the presynaptic ␣3␤2 nachr
subtype.
based on our results, nondepolarizing nmbas have the
potential to inhibit neuronal nachrs present in peripheral autonomic ganglia.
it has previously been shown that nondepolarizing
nmbas reduce hypoxic ventilatory response in humans14,15 and furthermore impair both the hypoxic and
nicotine-induced carotid body chemoreceptor response.16,17,51,52 neuronal nachrs have been found to
be present and functional in the carotid body and its
afferent system.53–55 we believe that the affinity of
nmbas to the human neuronal subtypes of nachrs is a
key component behind the interaction between nondepolarizing nmbas and regulation of breathing during
hypoxia. we also speculate whether the block of the ␣7
nachr subtype may have an impact on the cholinergic
inflammatory reflex mediated via the vagus nerve25,26
and thus on outcome for patients with inflammatory
conditions such as sepsis.
in summary, neuronal nachrs are widespread in the
central and peripheral nervous system, as well as in
extraneuronal tissues, and a block of these receptors by
nondepolarizing nmbas might interfere with important
vital functions.
we conclude that nondepolarizing nmbas concentration-dependently inhibit human neuronal nachrs exanesthesiology, v 105, no 3, sep 2006

pressed in xenopus oocytes and that the inhibition
mechanisms vary between different receptor subtypes
and nmbas. the inhibition of the presynaptic ␣3␤2
nachr subtype at the motor nerve end provides a possible molecular explanation for the tetanic and tof fade
seen during a nondepolarizing neuromuscular block.
