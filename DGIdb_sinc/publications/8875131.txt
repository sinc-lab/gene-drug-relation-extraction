summary
...  xxxd3094xxx  is a new selective ~ opioid receptor
agonist of higher potency than alfentanil, with
pharmacological effects that essentially parallel
those of alfentanil and other opioids in this class.
... unlike other opioids,  xxxd3094xxx  is rapidly
hydrolysed by nonspecific plasma and tissue esterases: this imparts brevity of action, precise and rapidly titratable effects (due to rapid onset and offset),
non-cumulative opioid effects and rapid recovery
after cessation of administration.
... the onset of action of  xxxd3094xxx  is similar to that
of alfentanil, although its offset is considerably
more rapid and independent of the duration of infusion.  xxxd3094xxx  also has a sparing effect on
hypnotics and sedatives.
... its brevity of action ensures not only a rapid resolution of adverse effects but also a rapid offset of
analgesic effect. therefore, appropriate postoperative analgesia, when necessary, should be established before discontinuation of  xxxd3094xxx 
infusion .
... the unique pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd3094xxx  facilitates 'real time' management of intraoperative stress, as well as provision of optimal
intraoperative analgesia without compromising recovery for a variety of surgical procedures.

1. pharmacodynamic profile
•  xxxd3094xxx  is"'" 15- to 30-fold more potent than
alfentanil in humans, based on 50% effective blood
concentrations (ecso) for various clinical endpoints, including analgesic effects,[2] lack of response to intubation and surgical incision[3] and
management of intraoperative stress response)4]
analgesic effects
 xxxd3094xxx 

the use of intraoperati ve analgesics is pi votal to
'balanced' anaesthesia: judicious use of these
agents reduces the requirement for anaesthetic (inhalation or intravenous) and/or hypnotic agents,
provides cardiovascular stability by suppressing
sympathetic stimulation and facilitates comfortable postoperative awakening, provided adequate
plasma concentrations of the analgesic extend into
the immediate postoperative period.
the development of opioid agonists for adjunctive use during general or regional anaesthesia has focused on new agents with increased potency, reduced cardiovascular adverse effects
and a pharmacokinetic profile that enables ready
titrability of pharmacological effect. in this respect, the established opioid agents, which include fentanyl, sufentanil and alfentanil, not
only lack at least one of these particularly desirable features but also have potentially cumulative effects. repeated or continuous dosing results in cumulation in peripheral compartments
to the extent that a decline in drug concentration
becomes protracted with the potential for delayed recovery due to respiratory depression.
consequently, the established agents are not always used at optimal analgesic doses throughout
the surgical procedure.
 xxxd3094xxx  is the first agent in a new class of
very short-acting 4-anilidopiperidines with potent
and selective f.l opioid receptor agonist activity)l]
it has been submitted for regulatory approval
throughout the world and has received approval in
the us and germany.

•  xxxd3094xxx , like alfentanil, produces a dosedependent increase in analgesia)2]  xxxd3094xxx 
infusion produced a rapid onset of effect, similar to
that of alfentanil infusion, in a randomised crossover study in 10 healthy volunteers: the time required for equilibration of peak blood concentration and peak effect (ty)c,,q) was similar for both
drugs (1.6 vs 0.96 min).[s] peak analgesic effect
after single intravenous doses of either agent in 48
healthy volunteers was observed at 1- or 3-minute
assessments for both drugs, with a similar duration
of actionp] the offset of  xxxd3094xxx  activity was
lo-fold more rapid than that of alfentanil (5.4 vs 54
min; p < 0.01) in 30 healthy volunteers randomised
to receive a 3-hour infusion of either agent at
equieffective concentrations)6]
• according to data from a randomised study involving 286 patients, effective analgesia (based on
attenuation of responses to surgical stress) was better provided at higher (0.4 f.lg/kg/min) than at lower
(0.2 f.lg/kg/min)  xxxd3094xxx  infusion rate, although both doses were better than fentanyl 1 to 3
f.lg/kg (p < 0.05).[7] in a dose-response study in 51
inpatients, the median effective dose (edso) of
 xxxd3094xxx  to abolish responses to all surgical
stimuli was 0.52 f.lg/kg/min; the opioid was administered (i f.lg/kg followed by infusion 0.025 to 2
f.lg/kg/min) after anaesthesia was induced with propofol and ventilation maintained with nitrous oxide
(n 20) 67% in oxygen (0 2»)8] isoflurane rescue
was more commonly needed when  xxxd3094xxx  infusion rates were <0.3 f.lg/kg/min.[8] both  xxxd3094xxx  and n20 were discontinued at the end of surgery, and all patients recovered at similar times
independent of the infusion rate received (fig. 1).

 xxxd3094xxx : new drug profile

cardiovascular and respiratory effects
•  xxxd3094xxx  did not induce histamine release
in 24 surgical inpatients who received the opioid
at doses (2 to 30 flg/kg infused over 1 min) considerably greater than those recommended for clinical
use in the presence of isoflurane;[9] a significant
decline in blood pressure and heart rate over time
was noted at all doses administered. the haemodynamic changes could be attenuated by premedication with intravenous  xxxd2220xxx  0.3 to
o.4mg and readily reversed with intravenous adrenergic agents. [10]
•  xxxd3094xxx  (0.0625 to 2 flg/kg), like alfentanil
(8 to 32 flg/kg), produced dose-dependent respiratory depression in 48 healthy volunteersp] peak
effect on arterial carbon dioxide (pac0 2; maximum increase) and 02 tension (pa02; maximum
decrease) occurred 5 minutes after single intravenous doses of either agentj2]

responsiveness

• patients with chronic liver disease showed increased sensitivity to the ventilatory depressant effects of  xxxd3094xxx , with significantly lower concentrations of the drug required to depress
c02-stimulated minute ventilation by 50%: 1.56
flg/l (95% confidence interval 1.37-1.76 flgll)
versus 2.52 flgll (95% confidence interval 2.072.97 flg/l) for matched controls with normal hepatic functionjl2] however, given the brevity of
action of this drug, the clinical significance of this
finding is uncertain.
• intravenous naloxone 6 flg/kg reversed the depressed ventilatory response to hypoxic challenge
during  xxxd3094xxx  0.025 flg/kg/min or alfentanil
0.5 flg/kg/min infusion in 12 healthy volunteers.[l3] at this dose, however, naloxone did not
reverse the depressant effect during a high infusion
rate of  xxxd3094xxx  (0.1 flg/kg/min). spontaneous
recovery of ventilatory function was faster after
cessation of  xxxd3094xxx  infusion (p < 0.0 i vs alfentanil).[13]

randomised placebo-controlled double-blind
study)16] at the higher doses of these 2 agents, cerebral perfusion pressure decreased (p < 0.01 vs
placebo) in parallel with a decrease in mean arterial
pressure (p < 0.01 vs placebo).d6]
•  xxxd3094xxx  1, 2 or 3 ilg/kg/min, administered
as the sole induction agent in 14 premedicated (lorazepam 40 ilg/kg) patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery, induced and maintained
a stable eeg state (>50% reduction in spectral
edge frequency) without evidence of seizure activity.[l7]
•  xxxd3094xxx  produced a dose-dependent reduction in auditory and somatosensory evoked responses during isoflurane anaesthesia in 60 patients.[18]

2. pharmacokinetic profile
•  xxxd3094xxx  exhibits a linear and dose-independent pharmacokinetic profile;[19] its distribution can be described by either a 2- or a 3-compartment pharmacokinetic model,[2,5,19,20] although
distribution into the third compartment is limited,
accounting for <5% of total exposure.[l9]
• intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  1 to 2 ilg/kg showed a
biexponential decline in plasma concentrations (vs
triexponential decline for alfentanil 8 to 32 ilg/kg)
in healthy volunteers,l2] clearance of  xxxd3094xxx 
was faster than that of alfentanil (41.2 vs 9.0
ml/min/kg)p]  xxxd3094xxx  had a volume of distribution of 0.39 l/kg, a distribution phase half-life
of 0.94 minutes and a rapid onset of action (1.3 min
half-time for equilibration between plasma and effect compartment),i2] mean terminal elimination
half-life (ty2~) of  xxxd3094xxx  was considerably
shorter than that of alfentanil (9.5 vs 57.8 min).[2]
• total clearance (2.5 to 3.8 umin) and steadystate volume of distribution (vss; 24 to  xxxd2321xxx ) were
dose-independent in 24 surgical patients given intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  2 to 30 ilg/kg infused over
1 minute[20] or 10 healthy volunteers given a con© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

central compartment volume of distribution (vc)
ranged from 5.7 to 8.0l; and mean residence time
ranged from 5.7 to 7.7 minutes,l20] bodyweight,
age or gender did not influence total clearance of
remifentanii.l2o,21] however, compared with lean
patients (n = 12; ±25% ideal bodyweight), obese
patients (n = 12; >30% ideal body weight) had
lesser central clearance (42.3 vs 27.9 mlimin/kg; p
< 0.01), vss (217.2 vs 146.8 ml/kg; p < 0.01) and
vc (101.9 vs 68.3 ml/kg; p < 0.01) values,l22] consequently, doses of  xxxd3094xxx  in obese patients
should be based on ideal rather than actual bodyweight.
• the time required for plasma: effect site concentrations of  xxxd3094xxx  to decrease by 50% (i.e.
the 'context-sensitive' half-time) after termination
of infusions lasting up to 240 minutes was 3.7 minutes (and generally :5:3 min[6,19]) versus 33.9, 58.5
and 262.5 minutes for sufentanil, alfentanil and
fentanyl, respectively,l20] in contrast to that of other
11 opioid receptor agonists, the context-sensitive
half-time of  xxxd3094xxx  was independent of the
duration of infusionp,5,19,20]
• in a study involving 6 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (cpb), whole blood concentration of  xxxd3094xxx  (administered at 1 ilg/kgl
min during induction of anaesthesia and maintained at constant rate until arrival in the intensive
care unit) peaked at 52 ilgll during hypothermia
but returned to pre-bypass levels (30 ilgll) after
completion of the procedure and rewarming. [23] total clearance of the opioid was reduced during
hypothermia (1.51 vs 1.96 l/h/kg pre-bypass; p <
0.02) but vc and vss were not affected)24]
• the pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd3094xxx  5
ilg/kg infused over 1 minute in 8 children (2 to 12
years old) was similar to that seen in adults.[25]
mean ty2~' vss and total clearance were 5 minutes,

randomised study in 105 patients undergoing

•  xxxd3094xxx  0.5 j.lg/kg/min, administered as
part of a balanced anaesthetic technique, was significantly better than alfentanil 1 j.lg/kg/min in attenuating intraoperative stress responses in a double-blind study involving 234 patients undergoing
major abdominal surgery (fig. 3).[35] both groups
showed similar median recovery times with respect
to spontaneous and adequate respiration and orientation. the extubation times were more predictable
after  xxxd3094xxx  than after alfentanil.[351 similarly, surgical outpatients (n = 201) receiving
 xxxd3094xxx  0.25 j.lg/kg/min (during isoflurane
0.8% end-tidal in 02/air anaesthesia) were less
likely to experience ~1 intraoperative surgical response (53 vs 66% for alfentanil 0.5 j.lg/kg/min; p

scores (trieger dot test at 30 min and digit symbol

adjunct to local and regional anaesthesia

 xxxd3094xxx  can be used for analgesia during
monitored anaesthesia care at the recommended
doses outlined in figure 5. the use of  xxxd3094xxx 
for this purpose should be supplemented with 02,
and the opioid should not be administered as a bolus dose (i.e. over <30 sec).
•  xxxd3094xxx  0.2 !1g/kg/min provided better sedation and analgesia than propofol 0.1 mg/kg/min
(p < 0.05) before, during and after axillary or ankle
block in 58 ambulatory patients,l4s] greater patient
comfort (83 vs 31 % patients with no pain; p < 0.05)
but less intraoperative sedation (p < 0.05) was
noted with an adjunctive irifusion of  xxxd3094xxx

•  xxxd3094xxx  0.1 ilg/kg/min proved an acceptable alternative to propofol 0.075 mg/kg/min for
monitored anaesthesia care in 44 premedicated (intravenous midazolam 2mg) patients undergoing
breast biopsy under local anaesthesiaj47] although
propofol recipients were better sedated (p < 0.05),
more of them required supplemental fentanyl rescue than  xxxd3094xxx  recipients (4 vs 0 patients; p
= 0.04)j47] propofol recipients were ambulatory
(40 min; p = 0.007) and ready for discharge (49
min; p = 0.017) earlier than  xxxd3094xxx  recipients
(58 and 66 min, respectively), although the time to
actual discharge between the two groups was not
significantly different (73 vs 88 min, propofol vs
 xxxd3094xxx )j47] the same study noted that a combination of intravenous midazolam 2mg and
 xxxd3094xxx  0.08 to 0.13 ilg/kg/min provided optimum sedation and analgesia,[48] with enhanced

respiratory depression[48] and reduced predictability and ease of titrability of  xxxd3094xxx  infusion (p < 0.05), although the overall quality of analgesia was not significantly different from that
seen with the lower midazolam (2mg) dosej49]
postoperative analgesia

 xxxd3094xxx  has a rapid offset of effect, and
therefore appropriate postoperative pain management must be initiated before termination of
 xxxd3094xxx  infusion. this can be achieved by administration of a long-duration analgesic before the
end of surgery or by administration of  xxxd3094xxx 
continuous infusion at a reduced rate in the immediate postoperative period before transition to ward
analgesia. if the latter option is exercised,  xxxd3094xxx  must be administered in a setting fully

with  xxxd3094xxx  are characteristic of)..l opioid receptor agonist pharmacology. at recommended
doses during induction and/or maintenance of general anaesthesia, common events (21 % incidence)
included bradycardia, hypotension and skeletal
muscle rigidity. the overall incidence of muscle
rigidity is reduced to <1 % when  xxxd3094xxx  is
administered concurrently with or after a hypnotic
induction agent. however, because of the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug, these adverse events
resolve within minutes of discontinuing or decreasing the rate of  xxxd3094xxx  administration)53)

events was lower (;;:::5 but ~18%) when the opioid
was administered concomitantly with midazolam

associated with a higher than usual incidence of

5.  xxxd3094xxx : current status
 xxxd3094xxx  is differentiated from other fl opioid receptor agonists in clinical use by its rapid
esterase metabolism which imparts a predictable
rapid onset and rapid dissipation of effects irrespective of the duration of its administration, as
well as its ease oftitrability, non-cumulative effects
with prolonged infusion, rapid recovery profile and
organ-independent biodegradation. such a profile
favours implementation of analgesia-based anaesthesia in various surgical settings and patient types
with consequent benefits in terms of optimum intraoperative analgesia and titrability throughout
the surgical procedure without compromising recovery.
based on the available data, the tolerability profile of  xxxd3094xxx  is essentially similar to that of
clinically used opioid receptor agonists, although
the unique pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd3094xxx 
(at least in the opioid class) confers rapid dissipation of effects such as ventilatory depression and
may reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea
and vomiting. however, because of the rapid offset
of analgesic effect there is little residual postoperative analgesia, resulting in an earlier than usual
perception of pain in the immediate postoperative
period. therefore, in anticipation of this effect, appropriate postoperative pain management should
be initiated before the end of the surgical procedure. moreover, because of its rapid onset of effect,
 xxxd3094xxx  should be administered only in a setting fully equipped for the monitoring and support

of respiratory and cardiovascular functions by persons specifically trained in the use of anaesthetic
drugs and the recognition and management of the
expected adverse effects of potent opioids.
the properties of  xxxd3094xxx  facilitate its use
in different patient types and surgical procedures
ranging from short interventions in day case surgery to prolonged infusions coupled with rapid recovery. overall,  xxxd3094xxx  is certain to attract
attention as it becomes more widely available for
general clinical use, particularly when rapid onset
and offset of opioid effects are desired.
