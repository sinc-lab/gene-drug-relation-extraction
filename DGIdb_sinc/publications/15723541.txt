the e. coli isozyme of  xxxg8xxx  ( xxxg8xxx ) is a tetrameric pyridoxal
phosphate-dependent enzyme that catalyzes transamination between primary amines and r-keto acids.
the roles of the active site residues v241, e211, and  xxxd1289xxx  in the  xxxg8xxx  mechanism have been probed
by site-directed mutagenesis. the beta-branched side chain of v241 facilitates formation of external aldimine
intermediates with primary amine substrates, while e211 provides charge compensation of r398 selectively
in the primary amine half-reaction and  xxxd1289xxx  forms a hydrophobic lid at the top of the substrate binding
site. the structures of the i50q, v241a, and e211s mutants were solved by x-ray crystallography to
resolutions of 2.1, 2.5, and 2.52 å, respectively. the structure of  xxxg8xxx  is similar in overall fold and
active site structure to that of dialkylglycine decarboxylase, which catalyzes both transamination and
decarboxylation half-reactions in its normal catalytic cycle. therefore, an attempt was made to convert
 xxxg8xxx  into a decarboxylation-dependent aminotransferase similar to dialkylglycine decarboxylase
by systematic mutation of e. coli  xxxg8xxx  active site residues. two of the twelve mutants presented,
e211s/i50g/c77k and e211s/i50h/v80d, have ∼10-fold higher decarboxylation activities than the wildtype enzyme, and the e211s/i50h/v80d has formally changed the reaction specificity to that of a
decarboxylase.

abstract:

pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (plp)1 is a versatile catalyst in
solution, catalyzing a variety of reactions (e.g. transamination, decarboxylation, racemization, etc) with a broad range
of amine-containing substrates (1). plp-dependent enzymes
catalyze an equally diverse group of reactions and are
ubiquitous in biological systems (2-5). it has been estimated,
for example, that ∼1.5% of the open reading frames in
bacterial genomes encode plp-dependent enzymes (6). the
protein component of plp-dependent enzymes endows the
coenzyme with much higher catalytic power as well as
reaction and substrate specificities. one of the major challenges with plp-dependent enzymes is understanding how
the unique environments of their active sites combine with
the basic functionality of the coenzyme to determine reaction
specificity.
plp-dependent enzymes have been grouped based on
amino acid sequence homologies (3-5). both  xxxg8xxx 
and dgd belong to the aminotransferase evolutionary
subgroup ii (7). multiple sequence alignments of subgroup
ii enzymes combined with known crystal structures show
mechanistically important conservations throughout the
sequences, as well as systematic variations in active site

residues that correlate well with known reaction and substrate
specificities (8-12).
the crystal structure of wild-type  xxxg8xxx  and its
complex with  xxxd439xxx  was recently solved using
the structure of dgd as a molecular replacement model (12).
the two structures show strong overall and active site
structural similarities, yet they share only 29% sequence
identity. differences in key catalytic residues in the gabaat and dgd active sites are expected since  xxxg8xxx 
catalyzes only transamination (scheme 2) and dgd catalyzes
both decarboxylation and transamination in its normal
catalytic cycle (scheme 3), and the substrate side chain
specificity differs between the two enzymes.
figure 1 presents an overlay of the active sites of e. coli
 xxxg8xxx  and dgd. one sees that the three residues critical
to the basic functioning of the coenzyme are identical in both
enzymes. in dgd theses are k272, q246, and  xxxd243xxx . k272
forms a schiff base with plp, as is found in all plpdependent enzymes. q246 and  xxxd243xxx  both interact directly
with plp, hydrogen bonding to the 3′-o and the pyridine
n, respectively. the latter residue is thought to maintain the
pyridine n in its protonated form, thereby enhancing the
electrophilic character of the pyridine ring. r406, which
interacts with the substrate r-carboxylate in dgd, is also
conserved in  xxxg8xxx  (r398) where it is thought to
interact with the r-carboxylate groups of r-amino and r-keto
acid substrates.
equally interesting are the differences between dgd and
 xxxg8xxx  in active site residues. q52 in dgd is thought
to provide a hydrogen bond to the substrate r-carboxylate

differences in reaction and substrate specificity of the two
enzymes suggested that redesign of the  xxxg8xxx  active
site to contain the decarboxylation apparatus of dgd might
be successful at converting  xxxg8xxx  into a decarboxylation-dependent aminotransferase specific for dicarboxylate
substrates. such an attempt to alter the reaction specificity
of  xxxg8xxx  is reported here, with mutations based on
information from the structures of  xxxg8xxx  and dgd, and
multiple sequence alignments of evolutionary subgroup ii
aminotransferases. a series of twelve site-directed mutants
has been constructed and analyzed kinetically. the results
show that approximately 10-fold increases in the kcat for
decarboxylation are achieved, while approximately 106-fold
increases in the ratio of decarboxylation to transamination
activities of  xxxg8xxx  are obtained mainly through reductions in transamination activity.

scheme 3: reaction catalyzed by dgd

in the decarboxylation half-reaction, thereby activating the
carboxylate stereoelectronically by placing the cr-co2bond parallel to the p orbitals of the pi bonding system of
the external aldimine intermediate (13). scheme 1 illustrates
this concept of stereoelectronic control of reactivity in
 xxxd3047xxx  enzymes, originally put forth by dunathan (14). the structurally equivalent residue in gabaat is  xxxd1289xxx , which is conserved as a hydrophobic residue in
all other subgroup ii aminotransferases. the specificity of
dgd for small  xxxd2217xxx  (e.g. aminoisobutyrate,
isovaline) is thought to originate in the restricted size of the
side chain binding pocket formed by w138, m141, and
y301. these residues are changed in  xxxg8xxx  to y138,
r141, and  xxxg295xxx , respectively, correlating well with the need
to bind the distal carboxylate groups of its substrates (12).
a245 at the back of the plp ring in dgd is changed to
v241 in  xxxg8xxx . we hypothesize that the larger v241
facilitates formation of the obligatory aldimine intermediate
between plp and gaba since this substrate has no
r-carboxylate. finally, s215 in dgd is conserved as e211
in  xxxg8xxx , which is found to interact with either r398
or y155 (12). the structure of the aoa-liganded wild-type
enzyme shows e211 neutralizing the charge of r398 in the
complex, which may have significant mechanistic implications. here, the roles of  xxxd1289xxx , v241, and e211 in  xxxg8xxx 
in substrate and reaction specificity are determined by
analysis of site-directed mutants, and the x-ray structures
of the i50q, v241a, and e211s mutants are presented.
the ease with which the amino acid changes between
dgd and  xxxg8xxx  can be rationalized based on the

materials. gaba, r-kg, carbenicillin, dtt,  xxxd26xxx , succinic semialdehyde (15% in water), nadph,
plp, l-glutamate, d-glutamate, d,l-r-methylaspartate, and
mdh were purchased from sigma. d,l-r-methylglutamate
was obtained from acros. ammonium sulfate, ampicillin,
tris, iptg, edta, ethylene glycol, and lysozyme were from
fisher.
enzyme preparations. wild-type  xxxg8xxx  and  xxxg138xxx 
were expressed and purified as described previously (12).
single mutants (v241a, e211s, and i50q) were created by
site-directed mutagenesis using overlap extension pcr (15)
and cloned into pet23a. the i50q/g295y, e211s/i50g/
c77k, and e211s/i50h/v80t mutants were obtained using
the kunkel mutagenesis kit from bio-rad and cloned into
pet23a. the genes for e211s/i50q/g295y/v241a, e211s/
i50g, e211s/i50h/v80d, e211s/i50n/v80d, e211s/i50n/
v80t, and e211s/i50g/c77r mutants were created by using
the kunkel mutagenesis kit from bio-rad and cloned into
pet28a, which adds a 6×his tag at the n-terminus of all
mutants. oligonucleotides were from life technologies. full
nucleotide sequences of the mutants were determined to
confirm the absence of adventitious mutations. the expression and purification of all mutants that did not contain a
6×his tag proceeded as described for wild-type  xxxg8xxx 
(12). the 6×his tag containing mutants were expressed as
described for wild-type  xxxg8xxx . the harvested cells were
suspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mm potassium
phosphate, ph 7.8, 100 µm plp, 0.5 m kcl, and 0.5 mg/
ml lysozyme and stirred on ice for 30 min. the cells were
disrupted by sonication, and cell debris was removed by
centrifugation for 30 min at 15,000 rpm. the supernatant
was mixed with 16 ml ni2+ charged chelating sepharose
fast flow resin from pharmacia. the mixture was then
incubated at room temperature with gentle agitation for 20
min, followed by centrifugation at 500g for 4 min. the pellet
was carefully decanted and resuspended in 100 ml washing
buffer containing 20 mm kh2po4, ph 7.4, 0.5 m kcl, 100
µm plp, and 10 mm imidazole. it was then centrifuged at
500g for 4 min and carefully decanted. the washing step
was repeated 3 additional times and another 2 times with
increasing imidazole concentrations up to 50 mm. elution
buffer containing 20 mm kh2po4, ph 7.4, 100 µm, 0.5 m
kcl, and 250 mm imidazole was then added and mixed
together by rotation for 5 min, followed by centrifugation at

500g for 4 min. the elution steps were repeated twice more
and all the supernatants were collected together and concentrated. the purities of all proteins were analyzed with
sds-page and their concentrations were determined with
the bio-rad dc assay, using igg as standard.
gaba transamination assay. the reaction was assayed
by coupling the succinic semialdehyde produced from the
transamination of gaba to the nadp-dependent  xxxg138xxx 
reaction, monitoring the increase of nadph absorbance at
340 nm. the reaction mixtures contained 0.032 µm gabaat, 100 mm tea-hcl, ph 7.8, 5 mm dtt, 1 mm edta,
100 µm plp, 100 mm kcl, 500 µm nadp, 3 units  xxxg138xxx ,
and six concentrations of gaba at six different fixed
concentrations of r-kg. all assay components were initially
mixed together except for e. coli  xxxg8xxx , and incubated
for 5 min at 25 °c. the reactions were initiated by adding
 xxxg8xxx  in a small volume.
for the v241a, e211s, i50q, i50q/g295y, e211s/i50g/
c77k, and e211s/i50h/v80t mutants, gaba transamination assays were performed as described for wild-type
 xxxg8xxx , except that different concentrations of enzyme
and substrates were used to obtain easily measurable absorbance changes. since the activities of the other mutants are
relatively low, assays were performed with 100 mm gaba
and 10 mm r-kg.
nonlinear regression for systems containing two or more
independent variables was performed with grafit 4.05, while
data sets containing a single independent variable were fitted
using kaleidagraph 3.6.
inhibition assay. the  xxxg138xxx  coupled assay described
above was employed for inhibition assays with wild-type
 xxxg8xxx , v241a, and i50q. initial rates of gaba
transamination in the presence of six concentrations of the
inhibitors (succinate, maleate, glutarate, and  xxxd439xxx ) were measured. the inhibition mechanisms for all
inhibitors were assumed to be competitive on the basis of
the structural similarities between the substrates of gabaat and the inhibitors. the reaction mixtures contained 100
mm tea-hcl, ph 7.8, 5 mm dtt, 1 mm edta, 100 µm
plp, 100 mm kcl, 500 µm nadp, 3 units  xxxg138xxx , gabaat, gaba, r-kg, and varying concentrations of the
inhibitors. the concentrations of gaba and r-kg are 10

mm and 2 mm for wild-type  xxxg8xxx , 100 mm and 50
mm for i50q, and 10 mm and 2 mm for v241a, respectively.
 xxxd233xxx  aminotransferase activity assay. the oxaloacetate produced from  xxxd233xxx  transamination of wildtype  xxxg8xxx  was coupled to the mdh reaction and the
decrease of nadh absorbance at 340 nm was monitored
(16). the reaction mixtures contained 9.2 µm  xxxg8xxx ,
100 mm tea-hcl, ph 7.8, 5 mm dtt, 1 mm edta, 100
µm plp, 100 mm kcl, 250 µm nadh, and 10 units mdh,
six concentrations of  xxxd233xxx  at 5 mm r-kg or six
concentrations of r-kg at 100 mm  xxxd233xxx . all assay
components were initially mixed except for  xxxg8xxx  and
incubated for 5 min at 25 °c. the reactions were initiated
by adding  xxxg8xxx  in a small volume. the  xxxd233xxx 
aminotransferase activity of e211s was analyzed similarly,
except that 0.02 mm r-kg was used with varying  xxxd233xxx 
concentrations.
decarboxylation assays. four amino acids (l-glutamate,
d-glutamate, d,l-r-methylglutamate, and d,l-r-methylaspartate) were tested for wild-type  xxxg8xxx  and all mutants
made. co2 produced from the decarboxylation of these
substrates was assayed with a carbon dioxide detection kit
from sigma diagnostics. the method is based on conversion
of phosphoenolpyruvate and co2 into oxaloacetate by pepc,
followed by the subsequent mdh catalyzed reduction of
oxaloacetate by nadh to produce malate and nad. the
decrease in nadh absorbance at 340 nm was followed. the
reaction conditions were: 80 mm amino acid substrate (lglutamate, d-glutamate, d,l-r-methylglutamate, d,l-r-methylaspartate), 2.4 mm r-ketoglutarate, 40 µm plp, 366 µm
nadh, 800 µl reagent a of the co2 detection kit
(containing 2.2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.32 mm nadh,
10 mm mg2+, buffer, ph 8.0, and 0.05% sodium azide), and
80 µl reagent b of the co2 detection kit (containing 2.75
units/ml pepc, 15.4 units/ml mdh, 10 mm mg2+, and
buffer, ph 6.5) in 1 ml total reaction solutions. the enzyme
concentrations were varied to obtain easily measurable
absorbance changes. the deionized h2o used to prepare all
reagents was purged with argon bubbled through two 10 m
koh scrubbers to remove co2. a blank was assayed along
with each amino acid substrate, in which  xxxg8xxx  (or

 xxxg8xxx  mutagenesis
mutant) was replaced by co2-free deionized h2o. the
activity of the blank was subtracted from the activity of the
sample. assays were performed by first combining all
ingredients except reagent b and  xxxg8xxx  (or mutant)
and incubating 5 min at 25 °c. next, reagent b was added
and followed by another 10 min incubation to remove any
background caused by dissolved co2. then  xxxg8xxx  (or
mutant) was added and the reactions were followed for 70
min. typically, the first 5 min showed a small burst of
absorbance change due to dissolved co2 in the enzyme
solution. therefore, this initial data was discarded. additionally, nahco3 was added to 800 µm after each assay to
confirm that the coupling enzymes were active. this co2
assay was tested with aib decarboxylation of dgd. kinetic
parameters for decarboxylation of aib by dgd obtained
with this assay were within error of those obtained using a
secondary  xxxg110xxx  coupled assay (17).
crystallization, x-ray diffraction data collection, and
structure determination of i50q, v241a, and e211s.
crystals of i50q, v241a, and e211s were obtained by the
hanging drop vapor diffusion method using a slight modification of the protocol described in a previous publication
(12). one microliter of enzyme at approximately 25 mg/ml
in 70 mm potassium phosphate, ph 7.6, 100 µm plp, and
1 mm dtt was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir
solution containing 0.1 m hepes-koh, ph 7.6, 100 µm
plp, and 1.2-1.6 m (nh4)2so4 and equilibrated against 1
ml of this reservoir solution. crystals generally appeared
in a week and reached their maximal dimensions after three
weeks. crystals for data collection were cryoprotected using
30% ethylene glycol in the mother liquor for 2 h. they were
mounted in a loop and flash frozen in a nitrogen steam at
100 k. data were collected for i50q on a proteum 6000
ccd using cu kr radiation, for v241a on a mar 345 image
plate using the synchrotron beamline 9-1 at stanford
synchrotron radiation laboratory at a wavelength of 0.98
å, and for e211s on an raxis iv image plate using cu
kr radiation. reflection intensities were integrated with
denzo, and merged and reduced to structure factors using
the scalepack, cad, and truncate programs from
the ccp4 suite (18). since the space group and unit cell
parameters are identical to those of the wild-type enzyme
(pdb code 1sf2), the structures of all three mutants were
determined using the wild-type structure as an initial model
for simulated annealing using cns after plp, ethylene
glycol, sulfate ions, and water molecules had been removed.
the models were further refined with energy minimization
and b-factor refinement combined with manual adjustments
using the program o. fo-fc and 2fo-fc electron density
maps as well as omit maps were calculated at regular
intervals to allow fitting and modification. omit maps for
the active sites of i50q and v241a clearly indicated that
there are two cofactor forms (plp and pmp) bound with
partial occupancies at the same site, with alternative conformations of k268. only pmp is found in the active site of
e211s. both plp and pmp were generated, assigned
occupancies of 50%, and refined as alternative ligands for
i50q and v241a.
since there is no facility in cns for multiple ligand
generation, this was done manually. the coordinates of both
ligands were read as structure input files of generate.inp of
cns to output molecular topology files and coordinate files

topology files were manually modified to insert the segid
 xxxg67xxx -dc1 for the four plp cofactors and segid  xxxg68xxx -dc2
for the four pmp cofactors. in the subsequent refinement,
the interactions between  xxxg67xxx -dc1 and  xxxg68xxx -dc2 were
omitted. it was also found that there are alternative confirmations for residues 112 and 217 in all four chains of i50q,
and for residue 112 in chains a and d of e211s. the
alternative conformations of those residues as well as k268
were generated and refined as described in the previous
publication (12). the aldimine adduct formed between k268
and plp in i50q and v241a was added as a protein patch
during refinements. the final refinement statistics are listed
in table 1. the coordinates have been deposited in the
protein data bank (pdb codes: i50q, 1szs; v241a, 1szu;
e211s, 1szk).
results
wild-type gaba transamination activity.  xxxg8xxx 
catalysis follows a ping-pong mechanism. the initial velocities measured at six concentrations of r-kg with six different
concentrations of gaba are presented in figure 2a. the
data suggest that substrate inhibition occurs with r-kg but
not with gaba. this is confirmed by double reciprocal plots
for both gaba (figure 2b) and r-kg (figure 2c). the
double reciprocal plot for gaba shows parallel lines at low
r-kg concentrations, indicating no substrate inhibition.
however, the plot for r-kg shows nonlinear curves indicating competitive substrate inhibition by r-kg against gaba,
due to r-kg binding to the plp form of  xxxg8xxx . the
entire data set was fitted by nonlinear regression to eq 1 (19).

decarboxylation activity. four amino acids (l-glutamate,
d-glutamate, d,l-r-methylglutamate, d,l-r-methylaspartate)
were tested as substrates for decarboxylation assays. the
values of kcat for wild type and mutants are presented in table
4. wild-type  xxxg8xxx  has low activity as a decarboxylase
(kcat for transamination is ∼8 × 105-fold greater than kcat
for decarboxylation). v241a and i50q/g295y do not show
detectable activity with any amino acid tested. neither i50q
nor e211s show dramatic improvements in decarboxylation
activity over wild type. since the structurally homologous
position in dgd corresponding to e211 in  xxxg8xxx  is a
conserved serine, the e211s mutant was selected as a
template for further mutagenesis studies.
the kcat values for the additional e211s-based mutants
are presented in table 4. none gives a dramatic increase in
decarboxylation activity with any of the four substrates tested.
however, the mutant e211s/i50h/v80d does show significant increases: 10-fold with l-glutamate, 6.4-fold with
d-glutamate, and 2-fold with d,l-r-methylglutamate. the
e211s/i50g/c77k also gives a 9-fold increase in activity
with l-glutamate. the lower activity of all the mutants with
d,l-r-methylaspartate may be due to the weaker binding of
d,l-r-methylaspartate caused by the e211s mutation (liu
and toney, unpublished results). table 4 also presents the
ratio of kcat for decarboxylation with different substrates to
that of gaba transamination for each enzyme. large
increases in this ratio are observed with the e211s/i50h/
v80d and e211s/i50g/c77r mutants, mainly due to greatly
decreased transamination activities.
crystal structures of i50q, v241a, and e211s. all three
structures were solved by molecular dynamics refinement
using wild-type  xxxg8xxx  as the initial model. the overall
structures for all three mutants show no significant differences with wild-type  xxxg8xxx . overlays of the cr traces
of the tetramers of i50q, v241a, and e211s with wild-type
 xxxg8xxx  result in rms deviations of 0.34, 0.25, and 0.27

figure 3a presents the electron density map for the active
site of i50q. the map indicates two cofactor forms (plp
and pmp with partial occupancies) and the original  xxxd1289xxx

i50q is very similar to that of wild-type  xxxg8xxx  except
for the mutation, the orientations of q79* and e211, and

the presence of two cofactor forms. the q79* side chain
twists toward  xxxg296xxx *. the new q79* side chain orientation
is stabilized by three hydrogen bonds involving the amide
side chain, formed with a water molecule, a sulfate ion, and
the backbone oxygen of  xxxg296xxx *.e211 in i50q takes on a
different orientation compared to that in wild-type gabaat; the side chain rotates around the cbeta-cgamma bond by
∼180°. the site where the e211 carboxylate group is found
in wild-type  xxxg8xxx  is filled by an ethylene glycol
molecule in i50q. the new orientation of e211 is stabilized
by three hydrogen bonds to the side chain carboxylate
group: two with water molecules and one with y155. in
the plp form, k268 and plp form an aldimine bond as in
wild-type  xxxg8xxx . however, in the pmp form, k268
takes on a new orientation, hydrogen bonding to t297*, and
the amino group of pmp rotates toward e211. the side chain
amide of q50 is involved in an average (over the four
monomers in the asymmetric unit) of two hydrogen bonds,
one to the sulfate ion and another to a water molecule. the
amide oxygen forms a hydrogen bond with k268 in the pmp
form.
figure 3b presents the electron density at the active site
of v241a. the cofactor exists in both plp and pmp forms.
a water molecule fills the void left by the mutation from
v241 to alanine. when the cofactor is in the pmp form, the
k268 amino group moves toward t297* forming a hydrogen
bond. the pmp amino group rotates toward e211.
the electron density map of the active site of e211s is
shown in figure 3c. only one cofactor form (pmp) is
indicated by the density. extra density in the active site has
been assigned as a sulfate ion, which is reasonable since the
mutation removes a negative charge from the active site.
k268 takes on a similar orientation to that in the pmp form

of v241a, forming a hydrogen bond with t297*. the pmp
amino group flips toward y138 and makes a strong salt
bridge with the sulfate ion. the cbeta-ogamma bond in the
introduced s211 residue has the same orientation as the cbetacgamma bond in i50q. the s211 hydroxyl group makes a
hydrogen bond with a water molecule.
an overlay of wild-type  xxxg8xxx  and the i50q, v241a,
and e211s mutants is shown in figure 3d. the structures
are all remarkably similar except for the sites of the
mutations, as noted above.
discussion
 xxxg8xxx  from e. coli is a typical plp-dependent
evolutionary subgroup ii aminotransferase that acts on both
primary amine and r-amino acid substrates (3, 4). the
overall  xxxg8xxx  catalyzed reaction consists of two halfreactions, in which the cofactor alternates between its
aldehydic (plp) and amino (pmp) forms (scheme 2). gaba
is converted to succinic semialdehyde in the first halfreaction, and r-kg is converted to l-glutamate in the second.
the ping-pong mechanism is evidenced by the parallel
double reciprocal lines at lower concentrations of r-kg in
figure 2b. the larger slopes at higher concentrations of
r-kg in figure 2b and the upwardly curving data in figure
2c are due to inhibition of the plp enzyme by r-kg, which
is competitive with respect to gaba. similar inhibition by
r-kg has been observed with aspartate aminotransferase
(20-23).
dgd is a plp-dependent enzyme that is also a member
of the aminotransferase evolutionary subgroup ii (7, 8). it
is unusual for this group of enzymes in that it does not
catalyze two simple transamination half-reactions but rather

an oxidative decarboxylation of  xxxd2217xxx  with
concomitant amino group transfer to the coenzyme in its first
half-reaction, followed by amino group transfer from the
coenzyme to an r-keto acid (e.g. pyruvate) in its second
(scheme 3). the structure of dgd was used as a molecular
replacement model in the original solution of the e. coli
 xxxg8xxx  structure, and the refined models show strong
similarities both in overall fold and active site structure (12).
the roles of the active site residues v241, e211, and  xxxd1289xxx 
in the  xxxg8xxx  mechanism have been probed here by sitedirected mutagenesis. the first  xxxg8xxx  mutant presented
in table 2 is v241a, which changes the beta-branched valine
residue located immediately behind the pyridine ring (figure
3d). dgd is unique among subgroup ii aminotransferases
in having an alanine at this position; all others members of
this group have either valine or isoleucine. since dgd is
unique in this group in utilizing r-amino acids in both halfreactions, we hypothesized that the beta-branched side chain
in the other enzymes is required to destabilize sterically the
internal aldimine formed between the active site lysine and
plp so that the primary amine substrates could more easily
displace this lysine in the transimination reaction required
to form the obligatory substrate-plp schiff base (external
aldimine) intermediate. that is, in dgd the interaction
between r406 and the substrate r-carboxylate facilitates
external aldimine formation whereas in the primary amine
half-reactions of the other subgroup ii enzymes the beta-branched
side chain behind plp is required to promote external
aldimine formation by sterically destabilizing the internal
aldimine. the v241a mutant is therefore predicted to have
a higher kgaba than wild-type enzyme since the internal
aldimine form of the enzyme should be selectively stabilized
by the mutation. this prediction is borne out by the results
presented in tables 2 and 3, which show a 5-fold higher
kgaba and a 2-fold higher kiaoa. the inhibition results with
the noncovalently binding dicarboxylate inhibitors presented
in table 3 (i.e. succinate, maleate, and glutarate) suggest
that the michaelis complex for dicarboxylate substrates has
been significantly destabilized by the mutation. the ∼6-fold
reduced kkg value additionally suggests a destabilization of
the unliganded pmp form of the enzyme by the mutation.
the mechanistic role of e211 in  xxxg8xxx  is thought to
be to neutralize the positive charge of r398 in the primary
amine half-reaction where the substrate does not contain an
r-carboxylate group. in the r-kg/l-glutamate half-reaction
the substrate carboxylate fulfills this charge-neutralization
role, with e211 rotating out of the substrate binding site to
interact with y155 as seen in the structure of the i50q
mutant. the e211s mutant probes the role of e211 in
 xxxg8xxx  and is predicted by the above reasoning to have
a lower kcat value due to the deleterious effects of the leaving
r398 unneutralized on the reaction energetics of the primary
amine half-reaction, to have a higher kgaba for a similar
reason, and to have a lower kkg since the r-kg carboxylate
no longer must compete with the e211 side chain carboxylate
for interaction with r398. these predictions are again borne
out by the results presented in table 2. the kcat value is lower
by ∼100-fold while kgaba is ∼15-fold higher and kkg is
500-fold lower. these results and the observation of e211
in the two alternative conformations in the x-ray structures
provides conclusive evidence for the role of this amino acid
in charge-neutralizing r398 in the primary amine half-

reaction. additional evidence in support of this conclusion
is provided by the results of aspartate aminotranferase activity
measurements, which employ only r-amino and r-keto acid
substrates (l-asparate and r-kg) and not primary amines.
the kcat value for e211s is ∼5-fold higher than that for wild
type, while the kl-asp and kkg values are 3-fold and 440fold lower. the larger decrease for kkg vs kl-asp probably
originates from greater stabilization of the amino group of
pmp by e211, via electrostatic interactions, compared to the
plp schiff base with k268. the e211s mutation would
selectively destabilize the pmp enzyme, causing a selective
lowering of kkg.
the i50q mutant was made for a 2-fold purpose, to test
the importance of the conserved  xxxd1289xxx  located at the “top” of
the  xxxg8xxx  active site (figure 1) and to introduce the
dgd active site residue thought to be most important to the
facilitation of r-amino acid decarboxylation (13). the most
remarkable quality of this mutant is the 12-fold higher kgaba,
the 43-fold higher kkg, and the ∼10-fold higher ki values
for the noncovalently binding inhibitors reported in table
3. these higher values are most readily interpreted in terms
of the longer q50 side chain sterically inhibiting access of
the substrates and inhibitors to the binding site (figures 3a
and 3d). the role of  xxxd1289xxx  in the wild-type enzyme is
apparently that of a lid that restricts the size of the substrate
binding pocket.
the decarboxylation activity of i50q was measured, as
were those of the other mutants and the wild-type enzyme
(table 4). the mutation has a negligible effect, in reference
to wild type, on the enzyme’s ability to catalyze decarboxylation of the four amino acids tested. this result is readily
understood from the x-ray structure; the location of the cr
atoms of q52 in dgd and  xxxd1289xxx  in  xxxg8xxx  are 2.3 å apart,
with that of  xxxd1289xxx  being closer to the substrate binding site
(figure 1). additionally, in dgd the backbone amide n of
s80 and the phenolic hydroxyl of y301 hydrogen bond to
the amide oxygen of q52, holding it in the proper orientation
to interact with the substrate carboxylate. similar orienting
interactions in  xxxg8xxx  are not present to position the side
chain amide of the i50q mutant.
as mentioned above, the active site residue y301 in dgd
hydrogen bonds to the q52 amide oxygen, helping to keep
it positioned to bind to the substrate r-carboxylate. the
corresponding residue in  xxxg8xxx  was mutated to give
the g295y mutant in the context of the i50q mutant. the
g295y mutation further reduces the i50q kcat by ∼400-fold
but causes the kgaba and kkg values to be reduced to wildtype values. the results of decarboxylation assays reported
in table 4 show that the addition of the g295y mutation to
the i50q mutation only lowers the enzyme’s ability to
catalyze decarboxylation, suggesting that the desired orienting interactions between the tyrosine and glutamine side
chains is not obtained. figure 1 shows that q79 in gabaat is located in front of  xxxg295xxx  and the introduced tyrosine
at this position may well incur steric clashes with the q79
side chain.
the e211s/i50q/g295y/v241a quadruple mutant incorporates all of the primary differences in active site structure
thought to engender decarboxylase activity in dgd. based
on the results with the component mutations, it is not
unexpected that this mutant shows only very low transamination activity and undetectable decarboxylase activity,

 xxxg8xxx  mutagenesis
further emphasizing the intricacies of protein structural
interactions required to give altered reaction specificity.
the results discussed above strongly suggested that the
side chain introduced by the i50q mutation was not
facilitating substrate carboxylate binding in the stereoelectronically activated position, rather hindering it sterically.
this was addressed by creating a series of mutants based on
e211s that contained glycine, histidine, or asparagine at
position 50 in  xxxg8xxx  as well as additional mutations.
the e211s/i50g, e211s/i50g/c77k, and e211s/i50g/
c77r mutants were made and tested for transamination and
decarboxylation activities. the introduction of either lys or
arg at position 77 is expected to provide hydrogen bonding/
salt bridging interactions with the substrate carboxylate in
the stereoelectronically activated position (scheme 1 and
figure 1). the i50g mutation added to the e211s mutation
further reduces kcat for transamination by 190-fold. remarkably, the additional c77k mutation in the e211s/i50g/c77k
mutant leads to the recovery of this transamination activity
whereas the c77r mutation does not. only the e211s/i50g/
c77k mutant shows significant increases in decarboxylation
activity toward both d- and l-glutamate: 9-fold and 5-fold,
respectively, compared to wild type (table 4).
the last strategy employed for introduction of decarboxylation activity into  xxxg8xxx  was to orient a polar residue
at position 50 such that it is maintained out of the central
substrate binding pocket and hydrogen bonds to the substrate
carboxylate when it is in the activated position. an examination of the x-ray structure suggested that v80 was the proper
location in which to introduce an “anchoring” residue. the
choices for residues at postion 50 were histidine and
asparagine based on their size and hydrogen bonding abilities.
therefore, the e211s/i50h/v80t, e211s/i50h/v80d, e211s/
i50n/v80t, and e211s/i50n/v80d mutants were constructed and analyzed. of these four mutant enzymes, the
e211s/i50h/v80t has transamination activity similar to the
parent e211s mutant while the e211s/i50h/v80d has the
greatest increase in decarboxylation activity of all the mutants
tested: 10-fold for l-glutamate, 6.4-fold for d-glutamate, and
2-fold for r-methylglutamate. combined with the large
reduction in transamination activity that these mutations
cause, the increase in decarboxylation activity gives a change
in reaction specificity for e211s/i50h/v80d; this mutant
actually favors decarboxylation over transamination by 2.7fold with l-glutamate and 4.3-fold with d-glutamate.
molecular dynamics calculations were performed on
tetramers of the wild-type enzyme with either aoa or d-2methylglutamate bound as a schiff base to plp, and also
for the e211s/i50g/c77k and the e211s/v80d/i50h mutants with d-2-methylglutamate bound to gain insight into
the low reactivity of the d-2-methylglutamate complexes.
the unliganded wild type was used as the initial structure
for the d-2-methylglutamate simulations. crystallographic
waters were retained (except those making steric clashes with
the ligand). the structures were slowly warmed from 0 to
320 k over 10 ps, followed by equilibration at 320 k for 10
ps, and slow cooling from 320 to 0 k over 10 ps. the final
structures were energy minimized for 100 cycles. the overall
structures are each very similar to the starting structures, but
there are significant active site differences. the wild-type
enzyme and e211s/v80d/i50h show steric clashes between
the 2-methylglutamate r-carboxylate and either  xxxd1289xxx  or h50,

biochemistry, vol. 44, no. 8, 2005 2991
while in all four subunits the e211s/i50g/c77k mutant
maintains a hydrogen bond/salt bridge between the lysine
introduced at position 77 and the d-2-methylglutamate
r-carboxylate. the most striking difference between the
wild-type aoa structure and all others is in the pyridine
nitrogen- xxxd239xxx  interaction. the average distance for the wildtype aoa structure is 3.16 ( 0.05, while it is significantly
larger for the d-2-methylglutamate structures with wild type
(3.54 ( 0.20), e211s/i50g/c77k (3.39 ( 0.29), and e211s/
v80d/i50h (3.62 ( 0.20). this increased pyridine nitrogend239 distance due to the relatively poor fit of d-2methylglutamate in the active site could account for the low
reactivity of these complexes.
in summary, it is demonstrated here that v241 in e. coli
 xxxg8xxx  facilitates external aldimine formation with
primary amine substrates (e.g. gaba). the role of e211 is
shown to be to compensate the positive charge of r398 in
the primary amine half-reaction, lowering kgaba, increasing
kkg, and increasing the kcat for the overall reaction likely by
increasing the rate of the gaba transamination half-reaction.
a series of mutants was constructed and analyzed in an
attempt to convert  xxxg8xxx  into a decarboxylationdependent aminotransferase, similar to dgd. the largest
increase in decarboxylation activity was observed with the
e211s/i50h/v80d mutant, which gave 10-fold and 6.4-fold
increases with l-and d-glutamate, respectively, and formally
converts the reaction specificity of the enzyme from that of
a transaminase to a decarboxylase. the moderate success at
introducing decarboxylase activity into  xxxg8xxx  highlights
the greater difficulty of altering the chemistry that an enzyme
catalyzes compared to simply altering the substrate that is
accepted without changing the catalytic mechanism, as is
frequently achieved in studies designed to alter substrate
specificity (24-26).
