abstract
inborn errors of vitamin b12 (cobalamin, cbl) metabolism are autosomal recessive disorders and have been classiwed into nine distinct
complementation classes ( xxxg1414xxx -cblh and mut). disorders avecting methylcobalamin metabolism cause megaloblastic anemia, which may
be accompanied by leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, and a variety of neurological problems. disorders avecting adenosylcobalamin
cause methylmalonic acidemia and metabolic acidosis. previous studies have shown that cobalamin binds to two enzymes in humans:
 xxxg1485xxx  in mitochondria and  xxxg1479xxx  in the cytosol. in this study, cobalamin binding patterns were
analyzed in crude mitochondrial fractions obtained from both control and patient wbroblasts that had been incubated with
[57co]cyanocobalamin. crude mitochondrial fractions from control wbroblasts conwrmed that the majority of [57co]cbl eluted with
 xxxg1485xxx . however, in six of the nine disorders, at least one previously unidentiwed mitochondrial cobalamin binding
protein was observed to bind [57co]cbl. the proportion of [57co]cbl that binds, is increased compared to controls when a dewciency in
either adenosylcobalamin synthesis or utilization prevents binding to  xxxg1485xxx . furthermore, unique cobalamin binding prowles emerged demonstrating how known mutations in these patients avect cobalamin binding to as yet unidentiwed proteins.

introduction
vitamin b12 (cobalamin, cbl) is necessary for the function of two human enzymes:  xxxg1485xxx 
(mcm; e.c. 5.4.99.2) and  xxxg1479xxx  (5-methyltetrahydrofolate: l-homocysteine s-methyltransferase;
e.c. 2.1.1.13). mcm catalyzes the conversion of l-methylmalonyl-coa to succinyl-coa and uses adenosylcobalamin (adocbl) as a cofactor. cbl must be transported into
mitochondria, reduced and adenosylated before it can be
utilized by mcm. in the cytosol, methylcobalamin
(mecbl) is synthesized through reduction and methylation

of cbl and utilized as a cofactor for  xxxg1479xxx  in
the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. nine diverent inborn errors of cbl metabolism have been identiwed
based on studies carried out on patient wbroblast cell lines.
these defects have been classiwed by genetic complementation and have been named  xxxg1414xxx -cblh and mut [1–5] (fig. 1).
dewciency in converting methylmalonyl-coa to succinyl coa results in methylmalonic acidemia. this can be
due to either a defective mcm enzyme (mut) or dewciency
in synthesis or utilization of adocbl ( xxxg1414xxx , cblb, and cblh/
cbld variant-2). the gene responsible for the  xxxg1414xxx  ( xxxg1414xxx )
complementation group was identiwed by analysis of prokaryotic gene arrangements [6]. the function of this gene
product, however, remains to be elucidated. the cblb disorder is attributed to defects in the atp:  xxxd1771xxx  adenosyltransferase gene ( xxxg1415xxx ) [7]. the gene responsible for

the cblh disorder has yet to be identiwed. recently, novel
subgroups of patients belonging to the cbld complementation class have been identiwed with either isolated homocystinuria (cbld-variant 1) or isolated methylmalonic acidemia
(cbld-variant 2) [8]. the cbld-variant 2 and cblh disorder
appear to be the same (dr. brian fowler and dr. david
watkins, personal communication). patients with methylmalonic acidemia are usually diagnosed between birth and
1 year [9] and present with lethargy, failure to thrive, hypotonia, vomiting, and severe acidosis [10]. fibroblast cultures
from patients with methylmalonic acidemia, show a reduction in their ability to incorporate propionate into cellular
macromolecules [11] and decreased levels of adocbl synthesis when supplied with exogenous cbl [12].
defective  xxxg1479xxx  ( xxxg1479xxx ) [13–15], defective
 xxxg1479xxx  reductase ( xxxg1480xxx ) [16] or other unidentiwed steps in the synthesis and/or utilization of mecbl
(cbld variant-1) [8] results in homocystinuria. patients usually present within the wrst few months of life with a variety
of symptoms: vomiting, poor feeding, lethargy, hypotonia,
seizures, developmental delay, and megaloblastic anemia
are generally present [10]. these disorders are caused by the
inability to convert homocysteine to methionine. as a

result, substrate levels are high in both blood and urine.
fibroblast studies show reduced incorporation of labeled
methyl-thf into acid-precipitable material [17] and a
decrease in cellular mecbl levels compared to controls [18].
three disorders avecting the synthesis of both coenzymes
have been described and clinically present with combined
homocystinuria and methylmalonic acidemia. the cblc and
cbld disorders avect early steps in synthesis of both coenzymes while the cblf disorder avects the release of internalized cbl from lysosomes [19,20].
in man, the majority of cellular cbl has been shown to
be bound to mcm in mitochondria and to  xxxg1479xxx  in the cytosol [21]. using wbroblast cell lines from
patients with diverent inborn errors in cbl metabolism, we
investigated the involvement of other mitochondrial cbl
binding proteins in adocbl synthesis and/or utilization.

skin wbroblasts were obtained with informed consent from patients
with inborn errors of cbl metabolism. fibroblasts were stored at the

hospital (montreal, quebec). cultures were routinely maintained in minimum essential medium (invitrogen canada inc., burlington, ontario) supplemented with non-essential amino acids and 10% fetal bovine serum
(cansera international, etobicoke, ontario). cell lines were chosen as representatives of their complementation class based on their biochemical
characteristics and, when available, the results of mutation analysis, as
outlined in table 1.
conxuent cultured wbroblasts were incubated for 96 h in minimum
essential medium supplemented with 10% human serum (gemini bioproducts, woodland, ca) that had been preincubated for 30 min at 37 °c
with 25 pg/ml [57co]cncbl (mp biomedicals inc., orangeburg, ny) to
allow binding of cbl to transcobalamin-ii. cells were harvested by trypsinization and the addition of media containing 10% fetal bovine serum
was used to terminate the trypsinization. whole cell pellets were kept at
¡80 °c until analysis. mitochondrial and cytosolic sub-cellular fractions
were obtained from parallel freshly-trypsinized cell pellets. however, compared to whole cell pellets, 5 times the number of cells were used to obtain
the sub-cellular fractions.

cell fractionation
all steps were performed on ice under dim red light in order to prevent
photolysis of cbl cofactors. sub-cellular fractions were obtained as
described by leary et al. [22] with modiwcations. trypsinized cells were
resuspended in 10 ml him buver [22] and homogenized with 30 strokes in
a 15 ml dounce glass tissue grinder (kontes glass co. vineland, nj).
homogenized cells were centrifuged at 4 °c at 8,000g for 10 min to pellet
mitochondria, and the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was retained. the
mitochondrial pellet was washed twice in him buver. whole cell, mitochondrial and cytosolic samples were stored at ¡80 °c protected from
light until analysis.

enzyme and protein assays
activities of marker enzymes were determined in aliquots of sub-cellular fractions. lactate dehydrogenase (cytosolic marker) was assayed as
described by bunch et al. [23]. succinic  xxxg569xxx  reductase (mitochondrial membrane marker) was assayed as described by sottocasa et al.
[24] except reactions were performed at room temperature and 0.03 mm

 xxxg569xxx  was used.  xxxg522xxx  (mitochondrial matrix marker)
was assayed in set buver (250 mm sucrose, 2 mm disodium edta,
10 mm tris–hcl, ph 7.4) with a protein concentration of at least 0.7 mg/
ml. the assay mixture contained 10 l of cellular material, 100 l of
assay buver (250 mm tris–hcl, ph 7.4), 100 l of 1.0 mm dtnb
(sigma-aldrich, oakville ontario), 100 l of 0.4 mm acetyl coenzyme
a (sigma-aldrich) prepared fresh, and 100 l of 2.3 mm oxaloacetate
(sigma-aldrich) prepared fresh. water was added for a total assay volume
of 1 ml. activity was determined by measuring the change in absorbance at
412 nm at room temperature for 6 min. protein content was determined by
the method of bradford [25] using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as standard.

gel wltration chromatography
all gel wltration chromatography was performed under dim red light.
whole cell pellets and crude mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in
700 l of 0.1 m potassium phosphate, ph 7.4. whole cell re-suspensions
were sonicated on ice for 4 £ 20 s at 26 , with 45 s intervals between
bursts, while crude mitochondrial and cytosolic samples were sonicated
on ice for 4 £ 15 s. sonicates were centrifuged at 5 °c at 175,000g for
30 min. the supernatants were wltered through 0.2 m acrodisc lc-13
wlters (pall, ann arbor, mi). 500 l of the supernatants were analyzed
by fplc on a tricorn superose-12 10/300 gel wltration column (ge
healthcare, baie d’urfé, quebec) equilibrated in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buver, ph 7.4. the column was calibrated using high and low
molecular weight gel wltration protein standards (ge healthcare). sixty
500 l fractions were collected and radioactivity determined by gamma
counting.
proteinase k digestions were carried out on whole cell and mitochondrial sonicates after centrifugation at 175,000g for 30 min by the addition
of 7 g of proteinase k (qiagen, mississauga, ontario) to each of the
supernatants and incubation overnight at 37 °c. the gel wltration procedure was then performed as described above.

statistical methods
analyses were performed using mann–whitney u test (for unpaired-2group analysis) and kruskal–wallis test (for analysis of 3 or more groups).
values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically signiwcant.

the distribution of marker enzyme activity in crude
mitochondrial fractions demonstrated that an enrichment of mitochondria was achieved with the mitochondrial isolation procedure employed. the speciwc activity
of the mitochondrial membrane marker enzyme, succinate  xxxg569xxx  reductase, was highest in the crude
mitochondrial fractions (8.3 § 1.0 moles/mg protein/
min) and conwrmed a greater than two fold enrichment
of mitochondria compared with whole cell fractions. the
integrity of mitochondria in the crude mitochondrial
fractions was measured by the mitochondrial matrix
marker assay,  xxxg522xxx . speciwc activity was
58.1 § 7.1 moles/mg protein/min in the crude mitochondrial fractions, and 99.8 § 9.9 moles/mg protein/min

whole cell extracts and cytosolic fractions from mut wbroblasts had similar [57co]cbl elution prowles to control wbroblasts (fig. 2). however, in the crude mitochondrial fractions
enzyme-bound [57co]cbl represented only 0.042 § 0.032 pg

discussion
previous studies in cultured human wbroblasts [26], rat
liver [27] and rabbit liver [21] have demonstrated that the
majority of intracellular [57co]cbl exists bound to the
enzymes, mcm and  xxxg1479xxx . in the present
study, distribution of label in crude mitochondrial fractions
from cells incubated with transcobalamin ii-[57co]cncbl
was investigated in all complementation classes of inborn
errors of cbl metabolism ( xxxg1414xxx -cblh/cbl d variant-2 and
mut). the sub-cellular approach allowed investigation of
mitochondrial cobalamin distribution in the absence of the
large cytosolic pool of  xxxg1479xxx -bound cbl
which typically makes up more than 50% of total intracellular cobalamins, and allowed identiwcation of peak x.
the majority of labeled cbl in mitochondrial fractions
from control human wbroblasts was bound to a high molecular weight protein, presumably mcm, as observed in previous studies. a smaller peak eluting with an apparent
molecular weight of approximately 28 kda, was also
detected in control extracts, and made up a larger proportion of the [57co] labeled material in extracts of wbroblasts
from some inborn errors of cbl. this unknown material,

designated “peak x”, consisted of labeled cbl bound to an
unidentiwed protein or proteins, as shown by disappearance
of the peak and appearance of label as free cbl after proteinase k digestion. the possibility that there is more than
one mitochondrial cbl binding protein in peak x cannot be
excluded. the gel wltration column used in this study had a
broad molecular weight inclusion range and therefore only
further puriwcation of peak x will be able to conwrm
whether there are one or more other cbl binding proteins
found in mitochondria.
in previous studies of whole cell extracts, 5% of cbl was
shown to elute in the position of transcobalamin-ii (43 kda)
[21]. transcobalamin ii-bound cobalamin is taken up by
endocytosis, with breakdown of transcobalamin ii and subsequent release of free cobalamin from lysosomes. there may
be some contamination of the crude mitochondrial fractions
with lysosomes in the present study, resulting in presence of
transcobalamin ii-[57co]cbl which could co-elute with peak
x in the gel wltration system used. large amounts of unmetabolized cbl accumulate in lysosomes of cblf wbroblasts
[19,20]. in our study, free cbl was detected in crude mitochondrial fractions from cblf wbroblasts, but the majority of
free cobalamin in these cells was found in the cytosolic fractions. these results indicate that our crude mitochondrial
fractions are not devoid of lysosomes, but most lysosomal
material was found in the cytosol. when cytosolic fractions
from the other complementation classes were analyzed by gel
wltration, none of the [57co]cbl eluted as peak x reinforcing
that peak x does not appear to be transcobalamin-ii.

the amount of cbl bound to peak x was increased, with
decreased binding to mcm, in mitochondrial extracts of
wbroblasts from patients with decreased adocbl synthesis
due to mut, cblb, and cbld variant 2/cblh, with the largest
increase seen in mut wbroblasts. in cblb wbroblasts, where
the wnal step of adocbl synthesis, adenosylation of
 xxxd1771xxx , is impaired, [57co]cbl was nonetheless associated with peak x in the crude mitochondrial fractions,
indicating that the protein or proteins in peak x can bind
cbl that is not adenosylated.
the elution prowle in  xxxg1414xxx  cell lines was not signiwcantly
diverent compared to control prowles, with the majority of
[57co]cbl eluting bound to the peak corresponding to
mcm, although accumulation of adocbl is clearly
impaired in these cells [5]. this indicates that the defect in
 xxxg1414xxx  wbroblasts avects a step in cbl metabolism after that
avected in cblb patients, disproving earlier hypotheses that
the  xxxg1414xxx  gene product is involved in either transport
across the mitochondrial membrane or reduction of cbl [6].
these results suggest that cobalamin adenosyltransferase
functions normally in  xxxg1414xxx  wbroblasts, synthesizing adocbl and delivering it to mcm, but that mcm-bound
cobalamin is not maintained in its activated, adenosylated
state. this reinforces the hypothesis put forth recently that
the  xxxg1414xxx  protein is involved in protection of mcm or
protection of its cofactor from inactivation [28]. the form
of cbl that is bound to the peak corresponding to mcm in
 xxxg1414xxx  cell lines, however, has not yet been determined.
in their analysis of [57co]cbl binding proteins in whole
cell extracts, mellman et al. [26] suggest that in addition to
genetic complementation, the cblc and cbld complementation classes could be distinguished biochemically, with cbld
wbroblasts less severely avected than cblc wbroblasts based
on intracellular cbl binding. the results in the current
study extend the previous results to include diverences in
intramitochondrial [57co]cbl binding. it remains to be
determined how cbl enters the mitochondria and binds to
the protein or proteins in peak x in these mutant classes
when the defects in the cblc and cbld disorders avect early
steps in the pathway for both coenzymes.
the  xxxg1480xxx  and  xxxg1479xxx  disorders typically avect synthesis of
mecbl in the cytoplasm, but have no apparent evect on
synthesis of adocbl and might be expected to have no
evect on mitochondrial cbl metabolism. however, while
the mitochondrial cbl pattern for  xxxg1479xxx  wbroblasts did not
diver from control patterns,  xxxg1480xxx  wbroblast mitochondrial
extracts showed an increased peak x, suggesting that this
disorder in some way results in impairment of mitochondrial cbl metabolism. recently, in vitro studies showed that
 xxxg1479xxx  reductase together with atp:
 xxxd1771xxx  adenosyltransferase supports conversion of
cob(ii)alamin to adocbl [29]. this suggests a possible dual
role for  xxxg1479xxx  reductase in cbl metabolism.
 xxxg1480xxx  patients do not typically present with methylmalonic
acidemia, as would be expected if  xxxg1479xxx 
reductase is involved in reduction of cob(ii)alamin for the
synthesis of adocbl in vivo, although at least one  xxxg1480xxx 

patient has presented with transient methylmalonic acidemia. elution prowles were analyzed in cell lines from two
 xxxg1480xxx  patients with classical isolated homocystinuria and
from the  xxxg1480xxx  patient with homocystinuria and transient
methylmalonic acidemia (wg1401) [30]. no signiwcant
diverences in mitochondrial cbl distribution were observed
among these three cell lines (kruskal–wallis test).
although  xxxg1479xxx  reductase clearly has an
evect on mitochondrial metabolism as shown by our
results, a defect in the enzyme is not usually suycient to
cause methylmalonic acidemia.
the identity of the protein or proteins in peak x remains
to be determined. based on the results in this study, it can be
ruled out that peak x corresponds to a fragment of mcm.
the mutations identiwed in mut cell lines analyzed were very
early stop mutations (table 1). nonetheless, the elution patterns from the mitochondrial fractions of these mut cells
demonstrated a signiwcant increase in the binding of [57co]
to peak x. however, the products of the  xxxg1414xxx  (46.5 kda)
and  xxxg1415xxx  (27.3 kda) genes may be potential candidates.
the  xxxg1415xxx  gene product,  xxxd1771xxx  adenosyltransferase, is known to bind cobalamin, adenosylate reduced cbl
and transfer the product of its reaction to mcm [31]. the
increased proportion of peak x in extracts of cblb wbroblasts might suggest that peak x is not adenosyltransferase,
since its expression and/or binding of cbl would likely be
decreased in cells with  xxxg1415xxx  mutations; however, expression of the gene has not been investigated in the cell lines
used in these experiments. there is at present no evidence
that cbl binds to the  xxxg1414xxx  gene product. the protein
lacks the cbl binding consensus sequence (dxhxxg)
identiwed in  xxxg1479xxx  and adocbl-dependent
mutases [32], but this does not exclude however the possibility that it binds cbl at a diverent site [29]. the ortholog of
the  xxxg1414xxx  gene product in bacteria, meab, has been
shown to bind mcm directly [28,33] and the gene product
may function by stabilizing mcm rather than interacting
directly with cbl. there was no decrease in peak x in
extracts of  xxxg1414xxx  wbroblasts, which is inconsistent with it
being peak x, although the low level of peak x in control
extracts may make it diycult to observe small decreases.
the  xxxg1414xxx  mutations have been identiwed in the  xxxg1414xxx  lines
used in this study. one line is homozygous for a nonsense
mutation, and the second is heterozygous for the same nonsense mutation and a deletion. it might be predicted that, if
peak x is the  xxxg1414xxx  gene product, its expression should
have been decreased in extracts of both  xxxg1414xxx  lines. the lack
of high-quality antibody to  xxxg1414xxx  protein and  xxxg1415xxx 
protein makes direct assessment of the possibility that either
is peak x by immunoprecipitation problematic.
the results in this study indicate that in addition to the
two previously identiwed enzymes, there is at least one other
cbl binding protein present in mammalian cells. [57co]cbl is
bound to the protein or proteins in peak x in crude mitochondrial fractions; the peak is not present in cytosolic fractions. gel wltration analysis of crude mitochondrial extracts
has revealed distinctive [57co]cbl elution prowles for the

e. moras et al. / molecular genetics and metabolism 90 (2007) 140–147

diverent inborn errors of cbl metabolism, with an increase in
the quantity of [57co]cbl bound to peak x in six of the nine
disorders. these changes provide insight to the evects of
underlying genetic defects on mitochondrial cbl metabolism.
