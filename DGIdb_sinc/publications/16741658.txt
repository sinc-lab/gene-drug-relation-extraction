background. preclinical results indicate  xxxg786xxx  ( xxxg786xxx ) and basic fgf ( xxxg787xxx )
present in solid tumors as a cause of broad-spectrum chemoresistance, whereas earlier clinical studies
suggest that  xxxg787xxx  expression is associated with opposing outcomes in patients. we investigated the
relationship between fgf expression and paclitaxel activity in tumors from bladder, breast, head and
neck, ovarian, and prostate cancer patients.
materials and methods. tumors (n = 96) were maintained in three-dimensional histocultures, retaining
tumorystromal interaction. bladder tumors were treated with paclitaxel for 2 h, and the other tumors for
24 h. antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of paclitaxel were quantified and correlated with
expression of  xxxg786xxx ,  xxxg787xxx , p-glycoprotein (pgp), p53, and bcl-2.
results. fifty-one percent (49/96) and 63% (61/96) of tumors showed  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxg787xxx  staining,
respectively.  xxxg786xxx  expression was positively correlated with tumor stage ( p < 0.01), and  xxxg787xxx 
expression with tumor grade and pgp expression ( p < 0.05). paclitaxel inhibited antiproliferation in 86%
of tumors (83/96), with an average inhibition of 46 t 19% (mean t sd) in the responding tumors.
paclitaxel also induced apoptosis in 96% of tumors (92/96), with an average apoptotic index of 12 t 7%
in the responding tumors.  xxxg786xxx  expression did not correlate with tumor sensitivity to paclitaxel,
whereas  xxxg787xxx  expression showed an inverse correlation ( p < 0.01).  xxxg787xxx  expression was a stronger
predictor of paclitaxel resistance compared to pgp, p53, or bcl-2.
conclusion. these results support a role of  xxxg787xxx  in paclitaxel resistance in human patient tumors.

introduction
fibroblast growth factors (fgf) constitute a large family
of growth factors that are important in the control of cell
growth, differentiation, and embryogenesis (1y3). acidic and
basic fibroblast growth factors ( xxxg786xxx  and  xxxg787xxx ) are the
most abundant forms and the most extensively studied.  xxxg787xxx 
is also a potent angiogenic factor that acts as both a mitogen
and an activation of migration for endothelial cells (4).
the role of fgfs in chemoresistance is unclear. some
reports support the view that  xxxg787xxx  protects tumor and
stromal cells from chemotherapy or radiotherapy (3,5y13).
for example,  xxxg787xxx  prevented etoposide-induced apoptosis
in small cell lung cancer h-510 cells, and induced resistance
of human bladder tumor cells to cisplatin, chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells to  xxxd2120xxx , and hela and endothelial
cells to ionizing radiation.  xxxg787xxx  also caused resistance of
fibroblasts to  xxxd2827xxx , muscle
cells to sublethal ischemic insult, neural cells to neomycin

analog  xxxg418xxx , and inhibited apoptosis in vascular smooth
muscle cells. in contrast, several reports indicated that
addition of exogeneous  xxxg787xxx  or overexpression of  xxxg787xxx 
enhanced the sensitivity of human breast mcf7 tumor cells
to multiple chemotherapeutic agents (i.e., cisplatin, etoposide, 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, carboplatin, and docetaxel)
(14y17). the mechanism of chemosensitization is reported to
arise from down-regulation of bcl-2 and up-regulation of bax
(15,16,18,19).  xxxg787xxx -mediated chemosensitization was also
observed in other cell lines, including human neuronal pc12,
nih313 fibroblasts, and two ovarian and one pancreatic
tumor cell lines (14,19,20).
opposing effects of  xxxg787xxx  expression on patient prognosis have also been reported. on one hand,  xxxg787xxx  expression correlates with poor prognosis in lung, brain, thyroid,
liver, and gastric cancer patients (21y26). on the other hand,
higher  xxxg787xxx  expression was associated with improved
overall and disease-free survival in breast and ovarian cancer
patients (27y33). furthermore, one study showed that lower
 xxxg787xxx  plasma levels (< 400 pg/ml) in primary breast tumors
significantly correlated with increased tumor size and higher
tumor stage (32), whereas another study showed no significant relationship between tumor  xxxg787xxx  levels and survival
(31), and two more studies showed that enhanced  xxxg787xxx 
expression was associated with aggressive disease and worse
prognosis in primary, nodal-negative disease (28,33).

 xxxg787xxx  and paclitaxel resistance
our laboratory has shown that  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxg787xxx , at
clinically relevant concentrations, induce an up to 10-fold
resistance to drugs with diverse structures and action
mechanisms (34). subsequent in vitro and in vivo preclinical
studies showed enhancement of chemosensitivity by inhibitors of these growth factors (34y36). these findings support
using the fgf-targeting approach for chemosensitization.
the present study was conducted in part to examine the
potential clinical utility of such an approach and in part to
address the ambiguity introduced by the earlier, contradicting results on the role of  xxxg787xxx  on chemosensitivity. for
this purpose, we used the histocultures system, which retains
the microenvironment of solid tumors that is increasingly
recognized as being important in determining chemosensitivity (37,38). the major advantages of the histoculture
system are the maintenance of three-dimensional tissue
architecture, cellycell interaction, intratumoral heterogeneity, and the intertumoral heterogeneity when the histocultures are established with materials from different tumor
types or hosts (e.g., specimens from different patients). the
clinical relevance of the histoculture system had been
demonstrated in retrospective and semiprospective preclinical and clinical studies, showing that the chemosensitivity in
patient tumor histocultures correlates with the sensitivity,
resistance, and survival of head and neck, colorectal, and
gastric cancer patients who were treated with  xxxd2655xxx ,
doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, or cisplatin (39y 41).
using tumors obtained from bladder, breast, head and
neck, ovarian, prostate cancer patients, we established the
pharmacodynamics of paclitaxel and reported the relationships between paclitaxel activity and tumor pathobiological
parameters such as tumor grade, stage and proliferation, p53
status, and expression of the drug efflux  xxxg10xxx  p-glycoprotein
and the prosurvival bcl-2 protein (42). the goal of the
present study was to extend our previous observations and
use the archived tissues to determine whether the expression
of  xxxg786xxx  and/or  xxxg787xxx  is an important determinant of
paclitaxel resistance in clinical specimens.

materials and methods
chemicals and supplies
the chemicals used to study the pharmacodynamics of
paclitaxel and to detect pgp, p53, and bcl-2 were as
previously described (42). monoclonal antibodies against
 xxxg786xxx  and  xxxg787xxx  were purchased from sigma (st. louis,
mo, usa), and labeled streptavidinybiotin detection kit
from dako (carpiteria, ca, usa). all chemicals and
reagents were used as received.
procurement of tumor specimens
specimens of human bladder, breast, head and neck, ovarian, and prostate tumors were obtained via the tumor procurement service at the ohio state university comprehensive
cancer center. tumor pathology was determined by university
pathologists. of the 96 tumors studied, 95 were from chemotherapy-naive patients. the remaining tumor was from a head
and neck cancer patient that had received paclitaxel treatment.

1325
pharmacologic effects of paclitaxel
the pharmacodynamic data of the antiproliferative and
proapoptotic effects of paclitaxel were obtained from our
previous studies (42). the data were further analyzed to
obtain the overall effects (i.e., maximal antiproliferation
effect plus maximal apoptotic index) in individual tumors.
the determination of drug effects was as described
previously (42). briefly, patient tumors were cut to about
1 mm3 pieces. this size was found to be optimal for drug
activity evaluation (39y41). four to six tumor pieces were
placed on a 1 cm2 collegen gel presoaked in medium in 6well plates. after 3y4 days, the tumor histocultures were
treated with paclitaxel for 2 h (bladder tumors) or 24 h (all
other tumors). the 2-h treatment is the duration of
intravesical therapy of superficial bladder cancer, whereas
the 24-h exposure is one of the commonly used treatment
schedules in patients. proliferating cells were identified by
their labeling with a dna precursor (bromodeoxyuridine or
thymidine). apoptotic cells were identified by morphological
changes, tdt-mediated dutp nick end labeling, and/or
dna fragmentation. the proliferation and apoptotic
indices were calculated as the (number of labeled tumor
cells) divided by (number of total tumor cells). inhibition of
proliferation was calculated as (difference in proliferation
indices between untreated controls and drug-treated
samples) divided by (proliferation index of untreated
controls).
for the antiproliferation effect, we measured the maximal
effect (emax) and the paclitaxel concentration that produced
30% inhibition of dna precursor incorporation (ic30) in all
tumor cells (i.e., viable plus proapoptotic cells). for the proapoptotic effect, we measured the maximal increase in apoptotic index (emax). the overall effect was measured as the
sum of the emax values of the antiproliferation and proapoptotic effects.
immunohistochemistry
the data on pgp, p53, and bcl-2 expression in surgical
specimens, before treatment with paclitaxel, were obtained
from our previous study (42).  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxg787xxx  were detected
by using previously described immunohistochemical methods
(43). briefly, after dewaxing and rehydration sequentially in
xylene, ethanol, and water, tissue sections were boiled for 5
min in a 0.1 m citrate buffer (ph = 6.0), in a microwave oven,
then cooled, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs), and
incubated with dako blocking solution for 10 min and then
with mouse antihuman  xxxg786xxx  antibody or  xxxg787xxx  antibody for 2
h in a humidified chamber at room temperature. the antibodies were diluted in pbs containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum
albumin. the negative controls used mouse igg as the primary
antibody. the human ovarian cancer skov-3 cells, which
contain high level of  xxxg787xxx , were cultured as spheroid and
then used as a positive control for normalizing interexperimental variation. tissue sections were washed with pbs,
covered with the linker solution and then peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin solution, again washed twice with pbs, and
incubated for 5 min with diaminobenzidine and counterstained with hematoxylin. protein expression was measured
in a semiquantitative fashion by using a previously described

method (42). briefly, this method employs a three-level
grading system of the staining intensity (i.e., negative or j,
positive or +0, and strong positive or ++), using different
dilutions of the primary antibody.  xxxg786xxx  was stained with two
antibody dilutions, 1:50 and 1:100. a score of j was given
when a tissue failed to stain with either antibody dilutions, +
for tissues stained positive only at the low antibody dilution,
and ++ for tissues stained positive by both high and low
dilutions. similar criteria were used for  xxxg787xxx , which was
stained using 1:20 and 1:50 antibody dilutions. for each
tumor, between 40 and 80 histocultures were processed for
immunostaining.

fit (44).
our results indicated a positive correlation between
 xxxg787xxx  and pgp expression in patient tumors. to further
evaluate the generality of this observation, we searched
the cdna microarray data of the nci 60 cancer cell
lines (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/data setsnature2000.jsp) to
analyze the relationship between  xxxg787xxx  and  xxxg10xxx  gene
expressions.

with pgp expression and tumor grade ( p < 0.05), but not with
tumor stage or expression of p53 or bcl-2 proteins. on the
contrary,  xxxg786xxx  expression was negatively correlated with
tumor stage ( p < 0.01), but not with tumor grade or
expression of pgp, p53, or bcl-2 proteins.
linear regression analysis of the gene expression levels
of  xxxg787xxx  and  xxxg10xxx  in the nci 60 cell lines, as provided on

the pharmacodynamic data of the antiproliferative and proapoptotic
effects of paclitaxel were obtained from our previous studies (42).
for the antiproliferation effect, the maximal effect (emax) and the
paclitaxel concentration that produced 30% inhibition of dna
precursor incorporation (ic30) are provided. the proapoptotic effect
is presented as the maximal increase in apoptotic index. the overall
effect is the maximal inhibition of dna precursor-labeling index in
the remaining viable or nonapoptotic cells.

effects of paclitaxel on tumors
three aspects of paclitaxel effects, i.e., inhibition of
dna synthesis, induction of apoptosis, and the sum of both
effects (overall effect), were evaluated. table iii summarizes
the results.
for the antiproliferation effect, paclitaxel inhibited
dna synthesis in 86% (83/96) of tumors, with no effect
(i.e., not significantly different from 0% inhibition) on the
remaining 13 tumors. figure 2 shows a representative sigmoidal relationship between paclitaxel concentration and
inhibition of dna synthesis, in a head and neck tumor. with
the exception of one tumor that showed a 100% response,
the remaining tumors showed less-than-complete response,
where the maximal effect (emax) was achieved at 1 mm drug
concentration and was not enhanced when the drug concentration was increased to 10 mm. the average emax in the 83
responding tumors was 46%. the paclitaxel concentration
that produced 30% inhibition (ic30) showed a large, >10,000fold range, with the average value of 1 mm as the maximal
effect was less than 50% in most tumors, the ic30 and emax
values were used to compare the relative sensitivity of
individual tumors to paclitaxel.
for the proapoptotic effect, 86% (83 of 96) of untreated
tumors showed <1% apoptotic index, whereas the remaining
14% showed an index between 1 and 5.5%. paclitaxel
treatment significantly increased the apoptotic index in 96%

(92 of 96) of the tumors, with no effect in the remaining
tumors. the average increase in apoptotic index in the 92
responding tumors was 13%.
the overall maximal paclitaxel cytotoxicity or the
combination of the maximal antiproliferation and proapoptotic effects, observed in 92 tumors, was about 60%.

the correlation between fgf expression and other pathobiological parameters and the maximal effects of paclitaxel in three categories (i.e.,
inhibition of dna synthesis, apoptosis, overall effect) were analyzed using linear regression (maximal r 2 selection method). higher r 2 and
lower aic values indicate a better correlation. for the combination of two and more parameters, only those that show the highest r 2 were
listed. a negative correlation indicates a lower paclitaxel effect at a higher value of the parameter. a positive correlation indicates a higher
paclitaxel effect at a higher parameter value. na, not applicable.

 xxxg787xxx  and paclitaxel resistance

fig. 3. relationship between fgf expression in surgical specimens of patient tumors and
antiproliferation effect of paclitaxel. (a) ic30 vs.  xxxg786xxx  expression. (b) ic30 vs.  xxxg787xxx 
expression. (c) emax vs.  xxxg786xxx  expression. (d) emax vs.  xxxg787xxx  expression. values for
individual tumors are shown. tumors are grouped by the extents of fgf expression (j or
undetectable, + or low, ++ or high), as defined in materials and methods. the horizontal
bars indicate the median values of ic30 or emax. no significant differences in the ic30 or
emax values were found for tumors with different  xxxg786xxx  expression. in contrast, tumors
expressing high  xxxg787xxx  levels showed significantly higher ic30 and lower emax values
compared to tumors with lower  xxxg787xxx  levels (**p < 0.01).

and bcl-2), using multivariate regression analysis. the most
significant correlations for two to eight parameters, for
paclitaxel effects, are detailed in table iv.
for inhibition of dna synthesis, as neither ic30 nor emax
was normally distributed, we used their median values to
evaluate the relationships of these parameters with fgf
expressions. figure 3 shows the results. the respective median
values of ic30 for tumors expressing undetectable, low and
high protein levels were 1.35, 1.00, and 0.21 mm for  xxxg786xxx ,
and 0.43, 1.19, and 10.0 mm for  xxxg787xxx . the respective median
values of emax for these tumor groups were 37, 37, and 46%
for  xxxg786xxx , and 48, 42, and 25% for  xxxg787xxx . no significant
differences in the median ic30 or emax values were found
for tumors with different  xxxg786xxx  expression ( p = 0.103 for
ic30 and p = 0.147 for emax, kruskalywallis test with posthoc analysis). in contrast, tumors expressing high  xxxg787xxx 
levels showed significantly higher ic30 and lower emax values
compared to tumors with no or low  xxxg787xxx  levels ( p = 0.036
for ic30 and p = 0.001 for emax). conversely, tumors that did
not show detectable  xxxg787xxx  level showed the lowest ic30 and
highest emax values. these results suggest a correlation between high  xxxg787xxx  expression and low drug sensitivity.
further analysis indicated that in addition to  xxxg787xxx , six
pathobiologic parameters (i.e., tumor stage, tumor grade,
labeling index, p53 status and expression of pgp and bcl-2
proteins) showed significant correlations with the antiproliferation effect of paclitaxel. as with  xxxg787xxx , all correlations
were negative (i.e., higher values in each parameter corre-

lated with lower emax values, or resistance). as a single
parameter,  xxxg787xxx  expression showed the best correlation
with resistance. inclusion of other parameters further improved the relationships.
for the proapoptotic effect of paclitaxel, only three parameters (tumor grade, labeling index, and pgp expression)
showed significant correlations. opposite to the correlations
with the antiproliferation effect of paclitaxel, all correlations
with the proapoptotic effect were positive (i.e., higher values
in each parameter correlated with higher emax values, or sensitivity).  xxxg787xxx  and  xxxg786xxx  expression showed a trend of positive correlation, but neither relationship reached statistical
significance.
for the overall drug effect, four parameters (tumor
stage, labeling index, expression of  xxxg787xxx , and p53 status)
showed significant correlations with resistance; the best correlation was observed with  xxxg787xxx  expression.
a comparison of the intracellular localization of  xxxg787xxx 
(i.e., cytoplasm, nuclei, or both) with paclitaxel effects did
not show significant correlation (not shown).

discussion
the present study evaluated 96 patient tumors derived
from five tumor types (bladder, breast, head and neck,
ovarian, prostate) where paclitaxel has shown clinical activity. results obtained using these tumors maintained in the

1330
three-dimensional histoculture system indicate  xxxg787xxx  as the
most important predictor of paclitaxel resistance, compared
to other pathobiological factors including tumor grades,
stages, and expressions of mdr, p53, bcl-2, and  xxxg786xxx . the
 xxxg786xxx  level did not correlate with paclitaxel activity. it is
noted that  xxxg786xxx  plus  xxxg787xxx  was the second leading indicator
for the resistance of paclitaxel-induced antiproliferative
effect after  xxxg787xxx  plus tumor stages in the two-parameter
analysis. the correlations between paclitaxel activity and
tumor pathobiological parameters other than the fgfs have
been discussed in an earlier article (35).
the present study used a semiquantitative, immunohistochemical method to evaluate the fgf levels in the tumors.
this is a widely used method and, as reported here, has
yielded valuable information. for future studies of the
relationship between fgf inhibition and chemosensitization,
as would be needed to identify the optimal pharmacodynamics of fgf inhibitors, a more quantitative method such as
image analysis is needed to translate the immunohistochemical staining intensity to actual protein levels.
an additional interesting and unexpected finding of the
present study is the positive correlation between  xxxg787xxx  and
pgp protein levels in human tumors and the correlation
between  xxxg787xxx  and  xxxg10xxx  gene expressions in the nci 60
human cancer cell lines. we previously showed that high pgp
protein levels correlated with a greater extent of paclitaxelinduced apoptosis in human tumors (42). this finding was
subsequently confirmed in mcf7 breast cancer cells transfected with  xxxg10xxx ; this pgp effect seems to be specific to
antimicrotubule agents and is unrelated to the drug efflux
function of pgp (45,46).  xxxg787xxx  can initiate multiple signal
transduction pathways including the phosphatidylinositol 3
kinaseyakt 1 pathway, rasymap kinase pathway, and
protein kinase c (pkc)-dependent signal transduction pathway (47,48). pkc, in turn, can phosphorylate pgp, the  xxxg10xxx 
product. pkc is also often activated in cell lines demonstrating multidrug resistance (49,50). furthermore, both  xxxg10xxx  and
 xxxg787xxx  promoters are activated by mutant p53 and repressed
by wild-type p53 (51y55). these various commonalities
suggest a possible relationship between the broad-spectrum
resistance conferred by  xxxg10xxx  and  xxxg787xxx .
in summary, the results of the present study indicate
 xxxg787xxx  as the most important prognostic indicator of paclitaxel
resistance in human patient tumors, which is consistent with
our earlier findings in preclinical models, and suggest  xxxg787xxx  as
a potentially important chemoresistance mechanism in human
solid tumors, maintained as three-dimensional cultures.
