risperidone (ris), a new neuroleptic with 5-ht2- and dopamine d2
receptor-blocking properties, was compared with pcrphenazinc (per) in a
double-blind, multicentre, parallel-group study in 107 chronic
schizophrenics with acute exacerbation. ris 5-15 mg or per 16-48 mg
daily was given for 8 weeks. psychopathology was assessed with the positive
and negative syndrome scale (panss) and clinical global impression.
seventy-eight patients completed the trial; there was an equal number of
dropouts on both drugs. the mean daily dose at endpoint was 8.5 mg
ris and 28 mg per. the reduction in total panss score to endpoint did
not differ significantly, although there was a tendency in favour of ris.
the number of patients with predominantly negative symptoms who showed
at least 20% reduction in total panss score was significantly larger in
the ris group. furthermore, the number of patients showing at least 20%
reduction in brief psychiatric rating scale (bprs) score (bprs being a
subscale of panss) was significantly larger in the ris group. the hostility
cluster of bprs improved more on ris than on per in the endpoint
analysis. the overall prevalence of side effects was fairly similar in the two
groups.

neuroleptics are today regarded as a cornerstone in
the treatment of schizophrenia. however, conventional neuroleptics are mainly effective against positive symptoms, and it is often difficult to avoid extrapyramidal symptoms when giving effective dosage.
there is thus a need to develop new neuroleptics that
are more effective against the negative symptoms of
schizophrenia, as well as inducing a lower frequency
of extrapyramidal symptoms in therapeutic doses.
it is believed that the antischizophrenic effect of
neuroleptics is mainly due to their blocking of
dopamine d,-receptors, and one way to search for
better neuroleptics is to develop compounds that are
more selective against these receptors or perhaps
against a subgroup of d,-receptors. these compounds include sulpiride,  xxxd3096xxx  and raclopride. however, interference with other receptors in
the brain may also be of therapeutic value in schizophrenia, and perhaps especially with regard to negative symptoms. this is indicated by the remarkable
antischizophrenic effect of clozapine, which has a
modest affinity for d,-receptors, but a rather high

affinity to, for example, serotonin 5-ht2-receptors.
however, the relatively high frequency of agranulocytosis limits the use of clozapine.
risperidone is a benzisoxazole derivative with
relatively strong blocking effect on both dopamine
d, receptors and 5-ht, receptors (1,2). risperidone binds also to zl, a, and h, receptors. it is a
potent lsd antagonist, whereas it is practically devoid of anticholinergic effect. animal experiments
have indicated its low potency in inducing extrapyramidal symptoms (3,4), and all things considered,
risperidone thus seems to be a promising drug for
use in schizophrenia. early clinical trials suggest that
ris is effective on both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia (5, 6). subsequent doubleblind studies comparing it with haloperidol have
confirmed these results (7, 8).
in the present trial, we have compared therapeutic efficacy and side effects of risperidone with that
of another potent neuroleptic, perphenazine, in
chronic schizophrenic patients suffering from an
acute exacerbation.

material and methods

this was a multicentre double-blind parallel group
study that was carried out in 18 centres in denmark
and norway (see participants in acknowledgements). the study was approved by the relevant
ethics committees and was performed in accordance
with the declaration of helsinki 11.
inclusion criteria

patients were eligible for this study if they met the
following criteria:
age between 18 and 65;
diagnosis according to dsm-iii-r of chronic
schizophrenic disorder with acute exacerbation
(295.141295.241295.341295.94);and
informed consent from the patients (or their relatives or legal guardians).
exclusion criteria

the following datients were excluded:
patients with mental disorders other than chronic
schizophrenic disorder;
patients with clinically significant organic disorders;
patients with clinically relevant abnormalities in
laboratory tests before the start of the trial;
patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse as
defined in dsm-iii-r within the 12-month period
preceding the study;
patients who had received oral neuroleptic treatment less than 72 h or depot neuroleptics less than
3 weeks before the start of treatment;
patients committed to a mental hospital (denmark only); and
women of reproductive age without adequate contraception; pregnant or lactating women.
medication

tablets of identical appearance, containing either
2.5 mg ris or 8 mg per, were used. the starting
dose was one tablet twice daily, that is to say, 5 mg
ris or 16 mg per daily. during the first 4 weeks the
dose was titrated according to the individual needs
of the patient, to a maximum dose of 3 tablets twice
daily (15 mg ris, 48 mg per). during the last 4
weeks of the trial the dose was to be kept unchanged
if possible. however, if adverse effects occurred during this fixed-dose period, the dose could be reduced.

(9). this rating scale consists of 3 subscales: the
positive subscale, the negative subscale and the general psychopathology subscale. all 18 items of the
brief psychiatric rating scale (bprs) (10) occur in
the panss, so that the bprs total score and factor scores can be derived from it. the overall severity
of illness was also assessed with the 7-point clinical global impressions (cgi) scale, severity version, and the overall improvement since baseline with
the cgi, improvement version. all ratings were performed immediately before start of trial medication,
and after 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks.
parkinsonian symptoms were evaluated by means
of the extrapyramidal symptom rating scale
(esrs) (1 1). other adverse events were assessed by
the uku side effect rating scale (12).
statistical analysis

in order not to increase the risk of type 1 error
(accepting a difference as “true” when in fact it is
only due to chance), only one single improvement
variable was chosen for statistical comparisons between the two drug groups: the patients’ improvement at endpoint compared with baseline. all patients in whom at least one clinical assessment had
been performed after inclusion (50 patients on ris
and 51 on per) were included in the intention-totreat or endpoint analysis. the results at other time
points are presented but not statistically analysed.
two-tail parametric significance tests were used,
with a level of significance set at 5 % , for total and
subtotal scores on panss, total and factor scores
on bprs and the cgi scores of severity and improvement. the chi-square test was used to compare
the number of improved patients at endpoint (with
at least 20% reduction in total score on panss).
results
patient population

a total of 107 patients entered the trial (norway: 54,
denmark: 53); 55 were allocated to treatment with
ris, 52 to per. the mean age of the patients was
36 years (range 20-67); 77 patients (72%) were men
and 30 women. the two treatment groups were very
similar with respect to demography and baseline
characteristics such as sex, weight, height, diagnosis
and other data (table 1). for 10 patients (4 ris,
6 per) a concomitant disease was recorded at selection.
premature withdrawal

assessment

the key efficacy variable was the positive and negative syndrome scale for schizophrenia (panss)

396

seventy-eight patients (73 %) completed the 8-week
trial period (ris 41, per 37). thus, 14 patients
withdrew prematurely in the ris group and 15 in the

the treatment groups are comparable with respect to demographic and baseline characteristics: p> 0.05 (the chi-square test or fisher‘s exact probability test for nominal
variables, the cochran-mantel-haenszel test stratified by country for ordinal variables,
two-way analysis of variance with effects for group, country and interaction for continuous variable^).^ no information available in one risperidone-treated patient. 25
patients received more than one treatment. 22 patients received more than one treatment.

per group. of these, 8 patients on ris and 6 on
per were withdrawn because of adverse events.
two patients on ris were withdrawn due to lack of
therapeutic effect (after 15 and 28 days); 3 patients
on per were withdrawn for the same reason (after
13, 31, and 41 days). four patients on ris and 6 on
per were withdrawn because they stopped coming
to the control visits.
all prematurely withdrawn patients are included
in the side effect analysis, whereas endpoint analysis of therapeutic effect comprises only patients who
were assessed at least once after initiation of trial
medication (50 on ris, 51 on per). hence, 9 of the
14 prematurely withdrawn patients on ris and 14
of the 15 on per are included in the endpoint analysis.
medication

previous medication. before entering the wash-out
phase of the trial, 93 % of the patients had been using

drugs of diverse categories. phenothiazines and
thioxanthenes were the most commonly used antipsychotics. twenty-two patients (2 1 ”,:,) had used benzodiazepines. the two groups were comparable regarding previous medication (table 1).
trial medication. the mean daily dose of trial medication at endpoint was 8.5 mg for risperidone and
28 mg for perphenazine.
coricomitarit medication. during the entire treatment
period, 42 patients (76%) in the risperidone group
and 38 patients (73%) in the perphenazine group
used one or more concomitant medicines. benzodiazepines and orphenadrine were the most frequently
used concomitant drugs. there were no significant
differences in the use of concomitant drugs between
the two treatment groups.
clinical results: efficacy

the total treatment groups. table 2 shows the total
and subtotal panss scores and the total and cluster scores for bprs for the treatment groups at
baseline, after 8 weeks and at endpoint. there is only
one significant difference in the endpoint analysis:
the hostility cluster of bprs is improved more on
ris than on per ( p < 0.005). there is a nonsignificant tendency for ris to be better than per also on
the positive subscale of panss.
the reduction in mean total panss score at the
various time points is shown in fig. 1. there is a
tendency for greater improvement in the ris than in
the per group at weeks 2, 4, en 6. corresponding
results were recorded for the 3 panss subscales
(not shown).
clinical improvement, defined as at least 20% reduction in total panss score at endpoint, was seen
in 74% on ris and 59% on per (ns). if clinical
improvement is instead defined as at least 20% reduction in total bprs score, then improvement occurred in 78% on ris and 59% on per (p<0.05)
(table 3). the cgi severity scores were comparable
between the 2 treatment groups at every time point
during the treatment period. the mean cgi improvement scores, on the other hand, showed a
(nonsignificant) tendency for more favourable results
in the ris group: the number of patients showing
any degree of improvement at endpoint was 80% in
the ris group and 67% in the per group.
negative and positive subtypes according to p a n s s .
at baseline, 76 patients had a higher score on the
negative than on the positive panss subscale,
whereas the opposite was the case for 31 patients.
in the positive subgroup, there was no significant
difference in improvement at endpoint between those

clinical results: side effects

extrapyramidal symptoms. parkinsonian symptoms
were assessed with the parkinsonism subscale of the
esrs (1 1). this scale comprises a number of single
symptoms arranged in 2 clusters: hypokinetic symptoms (expressive automatic movements, bradykinesia, rigidity, gait and posture and sialorrhoea) and
hyperkinetic symptoms (tremor and akathisia); the
first cluster can range from a total score of 0 (absent)
to an extreme of 48, the second from 0 to 54. a
parkinsonism total score combines both clusters plus
postural stability.
table 5 shows the mean of these scores at baseline and the mean shift from baseline to maximum
score during treatment. there is a somewhat larger
increase in hypokinetic symptoms and parkinsonism
total score in the ris group than in the per group,
but the differences are far from significant.
during the trial period, use of antiparkinson drugs
was required by 15 patients (27%) in the ris and
17 (33%) in the per group.
uku side efsect rating scale. on this scale (12), the
single symptoms are rated on a scale ranging from

0 (absent) to 3 (maximal), regardless of cause; in
addition, a judgement is given on how likely the
symptom in question is drug-induced. table 6 shows
the most important results from use of the uku
scale during the trial: (a) the percentage of patients
showing (any degree) of the various symptoms at
baseline and after 1 and 8 weeks (for brevity, the
results after 2, 4 and 6 weeks are not shown), and
(b) the percentage of patients who at least once during the trial were given a higher score on the symptom in question than at baseline.
as is usually seen in a drug trial, the picture is
complex: the overall frequency of many symptoms
(such as depression) is markedly reduced during the
treatment period, but there are always some patients
who at some time show deterioration. in general, the
percentage of patients who reported an increase in
severity of symptoms in this study was similar in
both treatment groups for most items, with some
exceptions. an increase in severity of asthenia was
more frequently observed in the ris group (44%)
than in the per group (28%). this effect was also
seen in the item sleepiness or sedation (40% with
ris, 24% with per). other items with at least 10%
more patients reporting a deterioration in the ris-

risperidone versus perphenazine in chronic schizophrenia
discussion

the results of this study would appear to confirm
that ris is, like per, a potent antipsychotic agent.
moreover, comparative efficacy evaluations suggest
that ris is at least as effective as per, and in some
respects even better. although not all efficacy variables assumed statistical significance, a number did
so: the number of patients showing at least 20%
iniprovetnent on total bprs score was significantly
larger on ris than on per. risperidone was also
significantly better than perphenazine on the hostility cluster of bprs. in the subgroup of patients with
predominantly negative symptoms, risperidone was
significantly better than perphenazine with respect
to the number of patients reaching clinical improvement on the panss and bprs total scores.
the mean daily dose of risperidone during the last
4 weeks of this study was 8.5 mg. in previous open
dose-finding trials, the mean dose at endpoint varied between 3 mg and 9 mg ( 5 , 6, 13-17).
from the side effect evaluation in this trial,
patients’ tolerance to both drugs is comparable for
most items of the uku side effect rating scale.
the orthostatic dizziness and increased heart rate
reported with ris in the first week of the trial might
be explained by the adrenolytic properties of the
drug. those symptoms are expected to occur mostly
at the start of the administration, and they can be
avoided by starting with a low dose (1 mg twice
daily) and gradually increasing it. although there
was a statistically greater decrease in systolic blood
pressure in the perphenazine-treated patients, there
were less complaints of orthostatic dizziness and
palpitations in this group. the erection and ejaculatory disturbances seen in the risperidone treatment
group are probably also related to the adrenolytic
properties of the compound.
the weight gain observed with risperidone in the
present trial has been reported in several trials with
risperidone; a linear dose relationship is reported in
the fixed dose trials. thus, with the use of ris doses
within the assumed optimal dose range of 4-8 mg,
the weight increase is expected to be minor. the
clinical laboratory evaluations give further reassurance that the drug poses no laboratory safety problems.
conclusion

this study in chronic schizophrenic patients with
exacerbation has demonstrated that the combined
serotonin 5-ht2 and dopamine-d, antagonist risperidone is an antipsychotic at least as effective as
perphenazine. risperidone is more effective than
perphenazine in bringing about clinical improvement
in patients with predominantly negative symptoms.

risperidone causes few extrapyramidal symptoms
and has a tolerability comparable to that of perphenazine.
