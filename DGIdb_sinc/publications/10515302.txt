behav 64(2) 269–273, 1999.—the gabaa receptor complex contains a number of binding sites at which a variety of psychotropic drugs, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and some neurosteroids, act to potentiate or inhibit the effect of the
transmitter. many studies have reported that these drugs can produce discriminative stimulus actions, but the cueing effects
of compounds acting at different sites to enhance the effects of gaba are not identical. the discriminative stimulus effects
of benzodiazepines have been analyzed in detail, and there is also a great deal of information available on the effects of nonbenzodiazepine compounds acting at bz(v) recognition sites, which form part of the gabaa receptor complex. of particular interest are compounds with selectivity for the  xxxd367xxx (v1) receptor subtype including zolpidem, zaleplon, and cl 218,872.
 xxxd367xxx (v1)-selective drugs substitute for the discriminative stimulus produced by chlordiazepoxide only partially and at sedative
doses. this is consistent with the view that sedative effects of bz(v) receptor agonists are mediated by the  xxxd367xxx (v1) receptor
subtype, whereas the discriminative stimulus produced by chlordiazepoxide may be produced by activity at the bz2(v2) subtype. analysis of this hypothesis is complicated by the variety of levels of intrinsic activity shown by different drugs. © 1999

drug discrimination

benzodiazepine receptors

chlordiazepoxide

gaba (g- xxxd2177xxx ) is probably the most important
inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system, and acts through at least three receptor subtypes
(gabaa, gabab, and gabac receptors). the gabaa receptor is perhaps of particular significance for psychopharmacology because it contains a variety of binding sites at which
behavior-modifying drugs act to produce some or all of their
effects (25). among these drugs are benzodiazepines, barbiturates, ethanol, and some neurosteroids. these agents produce
many pharmacological effects, including discriminative stimulus actions in experimental animals and humans. drug discrimination is, therefore, an effective and important technique for studying the behavioral pharmacology of gabaa
receptors.
the drugs acting through gabaa receptors whose discriminative stimulus effects have been investigated most thoroughly are those that bind to the so-called benzodiazepine
(bz) or v receptors, and this article will focus on these agents.
however, many other drugs acting at the gabaa receptor
complex have been found to produce discriminable cues.

zolpidem

rats

these include ethanol, barbiturates, muscimol (7), the neurosteroid pregnanolone (28), sodium valproate (15), pentylenetetrazole (24), and clomethiazole (27). there have been found
to be different levels of cross-substitution between compounds that potentiate gabaergic transmission by acting at
different sites on gabaa receptors. in some cases, such as
with barbiturates and benzodiazepines, discriminative stimulus properties overlap considerably. in other cases, however,
such as between direct agonists at the transmitter site, like
muscimol and thip, and compounds acting at modulatory
sites, cross-substitution is much less (12). thus, as pointed out
some years ago (19), the behavioral effects of compounds acting at different sites can be distinguished by drug discrimination as well as by other behavioral methods.
stimulus effects of benzodiazepines and
related drugs

epines from placebo. the stimulus effects of this group of
drugs have been analyzed in great detail following early studies using chlordiazepoxide (3) and diazepam (9). in general,
there is complete cross-substitution between different benzodiazepines, and the potencies of different drugs to substitute
for diazepam were found to correlate highly with their in vitro
affinities to bind to bz receptors and with human therapeutic
doses (31). also consistent with a bz receptor-mediated effect are the findings that stimulus properties are antagonized
in a dose-related way by flumazenil and other bz receptor antagonists (10,18).
drugs with nonbenzodiazepine chemical structures, including zolpidem, abecarnil, zopiclone, suriclone, and alpidem, but which also potentiate the effects of gaba by acting
at bz (v) receptors, also produce discriminative stimulus effects, as would be expected. in some cases (see below) these
can be distinguished, at least partially, from those of benzodiazepines suggesting different mechanisms of action. there is
also some evidence that the discriminative stimulus effects of
all benzodiazepines are not identical, with lorazepam (2) and
alprazolam (30) showing more selective profiles.
chlordiazepoxide cue in rats

rats were trained to discriminate a dose of 5 mg/kg of
chlordiazepoxide from saline using a standard fixed-ratio
(fr)10 food reinforcement schedule during daily 15 min sessions [see (20) for more details of the procedure]. the discrimination was rapidly learned, and the chlordiazepoxide
ed50 doses for drug lever choice and decreases in rates of responding were approximately 2 and 12 mg/kg, respectively
(values differed only slightly for a number of experiments carried out during a period of over 10 years). the distinction between doses giving rise to the stimulus and those producing
sedative effects was also found with other benzodiazepines
believed to be full agonists at bz(v) receptors, suggesting
that the discriminative stimulus is not related to sedation (3).

fig. 1. dose-related responding on the drug-associated lever produced by bz(v) receptor partial agonists in rats trained to discriminate chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg, ip) from saline. the drugs tested
were: s imidazenil, d ro 17.1812, h bretazenil, j cgs 9896, n zk
91296, and m y23684. results are shown as the percentage of animals
tested choosing the chlordiazepoxide lever.

this point is further reinforced by the finding shown in fig. 1
that compounds known to act as partial agonists produced
dose-related substitution for chlordiazepoxide but, in most
cases, had no effect on rates of responding indicating a lack of
sedation or ataxia, effects that normally require a high level of
intrinsic efficacy (8).
receptor selectivity
the first suggestion that subtypes of bz(v) receptors
might exist was based on the observation that the nonbenzodiazepine, cl 218,872, bound to bz(v) receptors but showed
a somewhat different pharmacological profile from that of the
benzodiazepines themselves (13,14). cl 218,872 was described as showing selectivity for a  xxxd367xxx (v1) receptor subtype,
whereas benzodiazepines showed equal affinity for and activity at both  xxxd367xxx (v1) and bz2(v2) subtypes. recent research in
molecular pharmacology and molecular biology has been able
to characterize the structure of gabaa receptors, which
have a pentameric form containing different subunits called a,
b, g, etc. (25). the bz(v) binding site is now known to be associated with the a and g subunits. the pharmacologically defined  xxxd367xxx (v1) receptor subtype seems to correspond to
gabaa receptors containing a1 subunits, whereas the
bz2(v2) subtype is heterogeneous corresponding to gabaa
receptors with a2, a3, or a5 subunits (16,17).
gabaa receptors containing different a subunits do not
show a homogenous distribution in the cns, and it has been
suggested that different receptor subtypes may have different
functional roles (21). a number of compounds, including cl
218,872, zolpidem, alpidem, abecarnil, and zaleplon, have
been found to show  xxxd367xxx (v1) selectivity, corresponding to
higher affinity for gabaa receptors containing a1 subunits
than those containing a2, a3, or a5 subunits. in the case of
zolpidem, there is no affinity for, or activity at, a5 containing

receptors (5,11). these compounds have been used in drug
discrimination experiments in rats, and while there was found
to be some overlap with the stimulus effects of benzodiazepines and other nonselective compounds, this was far from
complete (1,6,22,23,29). it seems likely, therefore, that different stimulus effects of drugs can be produced by actions at different gabaa receptor subtypes.
figure 2 shows the effects of several compounds described
as showing  xxxd367xxx (v1) selectivity in rats trained to discriminate
chlordiazepoxide. with the exception of alpidem, all the drugs
produced dose-related responding on the chlordiazepoxideassociated lever, but only with the highest dose of sx 3228 did
all animals choose this lever. in fact, as is shown in table 1,
significant drug lever responding occurred only at doses that
also greatly decreased response rates. this observation is consistent with the view that sedative/hypnotic activity of bz(v)
receptor agonists is mediated by  xxxd367xxx (v1) receptor subtypes so
that  xxxd367xxx (v1) selective compounds have particularly marked
sedative effects (21). these results also seem consistent with
the idea that the discriminative stimulus produced by chlordiazepoxide is probably not mediated by activity at  xxxd367xxx (v1)
receptors. of course, if this is the case, higher doses of
 xxxd367xxx (v1) selective compounds would be expected to lose their
receptor selectivity and give rise to a chlordiazepoxide-like
stimulus. however, because animals do not respond at higher
doses, it is not possible to test this hypothesis with the present
method.
a corollary of the finding that low, nonsedative doses of
 xxxd367xxx (v1) selective compounds do not produce a discriminative
stimulus identical to that of nonselective drugs is that the
chlordiazepoxide stimulus may be mediated by activity at
bz2(v2) receptor subtypes. this hypothesis cannot be tested
directly at the present time because no compounds with clear
bz2(v2) selectivity are available for behavioral studies. however, some indirect evidence does exist. sanger and benavides
(20) argued that, if the chlordiazepoxide cue were produced
by activity at bz2(v2) sites, the potencies of different compounds to substitute for chlordiazepoxide should correlate
more highly with the binding affinities of the same compounds in bz2(v2)-rich areas of the cns than in areas containing predominantly  xxxd367xxx (v1) sites. this prediction was confirmed when it was found that statistically significant
correlations were found between behavior and in vivo displacement of 3h-flumazenil in the spinal cord [80% bz2(v2)],
hippocampus [60% bz2(v2)], and striatum [50% bz2(v2)],
but not in the cortex [35% bz(v2)] or cerebellum [, 5%
bz2(v2)].

fig. 3. regression lines showing the relationship between the
potencies of different compounds to substitute for the chlordiazepoxide cue (ed50 doses in mg/kg, ip) and to displace 3h-flumazenil
binding in vivo (id50 doses mg/kg, ip). data are shown for the cerebellum, which contains over 95% of the  xxxd367xxx (v1) receptor subtype
and the spinal cord, which contains approximately 20% of the
 xxxd367xxx (v1) receptor subtype.

since this analysis was carried out, several novel compounds have become available that show selectivity for
 xxxd367xxx (v1) sites, and it was considered of interest to carry out a
similar analysis once again. (although, clearly, the availability
of bz2(v2) selective agents would provide a much better
means of investigating this question). therefore, the potencies to substitute for chlordiazepoxide shown by the nonselective agents bretazenil, clonazepam, lorazepam, midazolam, alprazolam, zopiclone, and suriclone and the  xxxd367xxx (v1) selective
compounds abecarnil, sx 3228, zaleplon, zolpidem, and cl
218,872 were compared with potencies of the same drugs to
displace flumazenil from the cerebellum or spinal cord. the
resulting regression lines are shown in fig. 3. there is clearly a
very strong and significant correlation between drug-lever responding and binding in the bz2(v2)-rich spinal cord (r 5
0.96), but there was also a significant correlation for binding
in the cerebellum (r 5 0.73).
although this result is perhaps consistent with the notion
that bz2(v2) receptors are of relatively greater importance
than  xxxd367xxx (v1) sites in mediating the discriminative stimulus
produced by chlordiazepoxide, it clearly does not allow this
conclusion to be drawn with any great confidence. there are,
of course, a number of shortcomings of this correlational approach to look for mechanisms underlying behavioral effects
of drugs. one is the assumption that all the compounds studied have roughly similar levels of intrinsic activity at the receptors under investigation. this is clearly not the case, as at
least one of these compounds, bretazenil, is a partial agonist
probably at all receptor subtypes.
bretazenil would, thus, be expected to produce the chlordiazepoxide cue at doses that occupied a greater proportion
of bz(v) sites that do nonselective compounds. this was investigated directly by calculating the proportion of bz(v)
sites occupied in the cerebellum and spinal cord at doses that
produced a 50% substitution for chlordiazepoxide. figure 4
shows the results. as predicted, bretazenil occupied 50% of
receptors in both cns regions, a considerably higher percentage than that shown by many of the other drugs studied. high
levels of receptor occupancy were also shown by clonazepam
and abecarnil, consistent with the view that these compounds
may also be partial agonists (8,26). at the other end of the
scale, zolpidem, which in any event produced only partial substitution for chlordiazepoxide [figure 2; (4)] at sedative doses,
was active at doses occupying relatively low percentages of receptors in both regions. this would suggest that in vivo zolpidem has particularly high intrinsic activity, a result consistent

sanger et al.
provides no information on and makes no assumptions about
the regions mediating the cueing effects of benzodiazepines or
other drugs. although it seems likely that different gabaa
receptor subtypes are involved in the discriminative stimulus
effects of different members of this class of drugs, a conclusion also drawn recently by rowlett and woolverton (18) on
the basis of sophisticated pa2 and pkb analyses of data available in the literature, more selective compounds will probably
be required before the function of particular receptor subtypes can be defined with greater precision.
conclusions

fig. 4. calculated values for the percentage displacement of 3-flumazenil binding in the cerebellum and spinal cord of rats at ed50
doses to substitute for chlordiazepoxide. the drugs shown are bretazenil (br), abecarnil (abe), clonazepam (clon), zaleplon (zal),
sx 3228 (sx), midazolam (mid), alprazolam (alp), lorazepam
(lor), suriclone (sur), cl 218,872 (cl), zopiclone (zop), and
zolpidem (zol).

with electrophysiological findings (11). on the other hand, results shown in fig. 4 with some of the other compounds (e.g.,
zaleplon) do not seem to correspond completely with what is
known of their pharmacological effects.
these results emphasize how hazardous it may be to use
such correlations, even between behavior and in vivo biochemical results obtained under similar conditions, to draw
conclusions about the functional roles of different receptor
subtypes. it might also be noted here that this approach, involving data obtained from different regions of the rat cns,

experimental animals can be trained to discriminate compounds acting at a variety of sites on the gabaa receptor
complex. this method, therefore, has considerable potential
for allowing a fine analysis of the pharmacology of drugs that
potentiate or inhibit gabaergic neurotransmission. although the discriminative stimulus effects of compounds acting at bz(v) binding sites have been investigated in some
depth, a number of questions deserve further study. these include the significance of bz(v) receptor subtypes in mediating different stimulus effects. it can be argued that the
bz2(v2) subtype is of particular importance in the cue produced by chlordiazepoxide. however, a direct test of this hypothesis will not be possible until compounds highly selective
for bz2(v2) sites become available.
