methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria, cblc type (omim
277400), is the most common inborn error of  xxxd1771xxx 
(cobalamin) metabolism, with about 250 known cases. affected
individuals have developmental, hematological, neurological,
metabolic, ophthalmologic and dermatologic clinical findings1.
although considered a disease of infancy or childhood, some
individuals develop symptoms in adulthood2. the cblc locus
was mapped to chromosome region 1p by linkage analysis3.
we refined the chromosomal interval using homozygosity
mapping and haplotype analyses and identified the  xxxg1416xxx 
gene. in 204 individuals, 42 different mutations were
identified, many consistent with a loss of function of the
protein product. one mutation, 271dupa, accounted for 40%
of all disease alleles. transduction of wild-type  xxxg1416xxx 
into immortalized cblc fibroblast cell lines corrected the
cellular phenotype. molecular modeling predicts that the
c-terminal region of the gene product folds similarly to tonb,
a bacterial protein involved in energy transduction for
cobalamin uptake.
hyperhomocysteinemia has been correlated with increasing numbers
of medical disorders including birth defects, cardiovascular disease
and stroke, psychiatric disease, dementia and cancer4. cobalamin is an
important cofactor in homocysteine metabolism and in branchedchain amino acid and odd-chain fatty acid catabolism. it is synthesized by bacteria and not found in plants; thus, intake of animal
products or supplementation with cobalamin is required to prevent
deficiency. in mammalian cells, exogenous cobalamin is converted to
two active coenzyme derivatives: methylcobalamin (mecbl) and
adenosylcobalamin (adocbl). mecbl is required for activity of the
cytoplasmic enzyme  xxxg1479xxx , which converts homocysteine to methionine, and adocbl is required for activity of the

mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonyl coa mutase, which converts
to succinyl-coa.
three affected sibling pairs were concordant for 26 microsatellite markers (supplementary table 1 online) spanning the previously described candidate region between markers d1s3721 and
d1s2134 (2.9 cm, 6.6 mb; ref. 3; j.l. atkinson et al., am. j. hum.
genet. suppl. 71, 452, 2002), supporting gene assignment to this
interval (fig. 1a). haplotype analysis reduced this candidate region to
a 3.8-mb interval bounded by ja7079_1 and d1s2134 on the basis of
the smallest shared haplotype segment in two acadian individuals
(haplotype a; fig. 1a).
twenty-two consanguineous cblc individuals were homozygous
for two nonadjacent markers, d1s421 and ja2001; this contrasted
with 35% and 36% homozygosity, respectively, in 48 controls.
candidate genes were selected in the intervals surrounding these
markers. twenty-four snps, identified during sequencing of candidate
genes in the interval between d1s3175 and d1s2797, were
homozygous in eight individuals (four with reported consanguinity
and four without). a shared region of homozygosity was
identified between d1s3175 and snp rs2292487 in two of these
individuals, reducing the candidate interval to 686 kb. no
apparent causal mutations were detected in nine genes within this
region in eight cblc individuals. when marker d1s3175 was reevaluated and excluded from the haplotype, a longer homozygous
segment of 911 kb, bounded by d1s2677 and rs2292487 (haplotype
b; fig. 1a), was identified that encompassed six additional
genes. four sequence changes were detected in a gene identified on
the basis of est al080062.1 (fig. 1b,c). sequence changes included
two duplications (271dupa and 450_479dup30) and two mutations
creating premature termination codons (331c-t and 394c-t).
none of these sequence changes was detected in 105 controls.
the putative cblc gene was sequenced in members of four families

was consistent with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance
(supplementary fig. 1 online). these data strongly indicate that
this is the gene mutated in cblc individuals. we have designated

forty-two different mutations were identified in the  xxxg1416xxx  gene. the predicted effect
on protein or mrna is shown. mutations are listed in the order in which they occur
within the gene. dna mutation numbering is based on cdna sequence: +1 corresponds
to the a of the atg translation initiation codon (nm_015506.1). the number of disease
alleles identified for each mutation is listed. ‘r.spl’ indicates that the change is expected
to affect splicing.

incorporation of label from 5-[14c]methyltetrahydrofolate and
[14c]propionate into cellular macromolecules, was restored to control
levels, or above, in infected cblc fibroblasts (fig. 2a,b). normal
synthesis of both mecbl and adocbl from exogenous cyanocobalamin
(cncbl) was also restored in infected cblc fibroblasts (fig. 2c). the
intracellular level of cncbl, the stable nonphysiological cobalamin
derivative administered to cells, was decreased in both cblc and wildtype fibroblasts transduced with  xxxg1416xxx  (fig. 2c), suggesting that
cncbl was recruited into cellular metabolism more effectively.
clinically, cblc individuals have responded better to therapy with
hydroxylcobalamin (ohcbl) than cncbl (ref. 5); cblc fibroblasts in
culture use ohcbl more efficiently than cncbl (ref. 6).
the orf and flanking exon sequences of the  xxxg1416xxx  gene and
the noncoding portion of exons 4 and 5 (fig. 1b) were sequenced
from gdna. two putative mutations were identified in each of 185 of
204 individuals; one mutation was identified in five individuals; and in
14 individuals, no causal mutation was identified. forty-two different
mutations were identified. there were 13 missense mutations, 12
nonsense mutations, nine deletions that would result in frameshifts,
one in-frame deletion, one duplication with frameshift, one duplication without frameshift, two mutations affecting the initiation codon,
and three potential splice-site mutations (table 1; fig. 1c); none of
these was found in 105 controls. the most common mutation,
271dupa, occurred in 40% of all disease alleles. seven mutations
(217c-t, 331c-t, 394c-t, 457c-t, 481c-t, 482g-a,
616c-t) involved c-t transitions at cytosine residues adjacent
to guanine, a potential mutation hotspot7. four mutations may be due
to slippage during dna replication: 388_390deltac (tac 3),
435_436delat (at 2), 468_469delct (flanked by gg) and
547_548delgt (gt 2).
phase v2.1.1 (refs. 8,9) was used to estimate the frequencies of the
most likely haplotypes constructed from eight sequence variants
identified within and flanking  xxxg1416xxx  in 54 ceph individuals.
four common haplotypes were among the 19 different haplotypes
inferred from ceph individuals (fig. 3a). haplotypes for 99 cblc
individuals homozygous for one of 17 different  xxxg1416xxx  mutations
indicated that most mutations arose on one of the three most
common haplotypes (fig. 3b).
the 271dupa mutation was seen in individuals from several
different ethnic groups but was seen primarily in the european
group and was found predominantly on haplotype #2 (fig. 3b).
eight of 102 disease alleles carrying 271dupa differed from this
haplotype at a single nucleotide (1–302t-g, 1–50a-g, or
800g-a). these data are consistent with a single mutational event,
followed by mutation or recombination modifying the ancestral
haplotype. analysis of microsatellite markers directly flanking
 xxxg1416xxx  in 43 homozygous 271dupa individuals, including markers d1s2677 (179 kb telomeric to  xxxg1416xxx ) and d1s3175 (47 kb
centromeric to  xxxg1416xxx ), is consistent with this hypothesis (data
not shown). the 800g-a (r267q) sequence change was observed
on only three chromosomes carrying the 271dupa mutation and
segregated with 271dupa in one family.
seven mutations showed clustering by ethnicity. three of these
(3g-a, 331c-t and 394c-t) were each found on two different
haplotypes and may have arisen independently at least twice (fig. 3b).
of these, 331c-t and 394c-t occur at potential cg hotspots. the
11 individuals homozygous for 394c-t were indian, pakistani, or
middle eastern. five 331c-t haplotype #1 homozygotes were
french canadian or acadian, whereas two other homozygotes with
a different haplotype were european. three individuals with 3g-a
on haplotype #2 were italian or northern european; the individual

with 3g-a on haplotype #3 was also european. three individuals
with 440g-a were native american; four individuals with
547_548delgt were lebanese; three individuals with 608g-a
were hispanic; and the five individuals with 609g-a were east
asian (fig. 3b).
we compared genotype and phenotype in individuals carrying the
most common  xxxg1416xxx  mutations: 271dupa (r91kfsx14) and
331c-t (r111x) were associated with early-onset disease, whereas
394c-t (r132x) was associated with late-onset disease (table 2). in
contrast to individuals with early-onset disease, the late-onset group
was characterized by acute neurological deterioration without systemic
symptoms2. differences in rna stability or residual function of the
protein product are predicted to cause differences in phenotypes10.
the  xxxg1416xxx  protein is not a member of any previously identified gene family. it is well conserved among mammals. however, the
c-terminal end does not seem to be conserved in eukaryotes outside
mammalia, and we did not identify any homologous protein in
prokaryotes (supplementary note). motifs were identified in
 xxxg1416xxx  that are homologous to motifs in bacterial genes with
cobalamin-related functions. residues 118–138 of  xxxg1416xxx  had
52% amino acid similarity (52% identity) to residues 629–642 in
methylmalonyl coa mutase from streptomyces avermitilis, which are
part of its cobalamin-binding domain; this includes sequence with
identity to a portion of the canonical cobalamin-binding motif (122hxxgx126–154gg-156)11, which was conserved in all species analyzed

96

(fig. 4a). residues spanning 181–282 in  xxxg1416xxx  had similarity to
various tonb proteins from gram-negative bacteria. the highest
degree of similarity was to tonb from salmonella typhimurium:
 xxxg1416xxx  amino acid residues 242–280 had a similarity of 51%
(41% identity) to residues 119–156 of s. typhimurium tonb (p25945).
we aligned the primary sequence of  xxxg1416xxx  residues 185–282 to
e. coli tonb residues 152–239, for which a three-dimensional structure
is known12–14, using the computer program modeller15 to generate a
three-dimensional model structure of the  xxxg1416xxx  c-terminal
domain. the overall structure of the model (fig. 4b) is homologous
to the recently solved three-dimensional structure of the monomeric
c-terminal domain of e. coli tonb14. it conforms to acceptable
stoichiometric parameters. ramachandran analysis indicated that no
residues occurred within disallowed regions, with 80% of residues
occurring within the core regions, 17% within allowed regions and 3%
within generously allowed regions. no bad contacts were found within
the model. procheck16 analysis showed that the  xxxg1416xxx  model
had an overall average g factor of 0.360, above the threshold value

the  xxxg1416xxx  protein functions in a manner similar to the tonb

direct contact with a cognate protein partner to facilitate conformational changes necessary for cobalamin metabolism. the only region

alignment of  xxxg1416xxx  with e. coli tonb, these residues are present
as an insertion relative to the e. coli tonb sequence. they cause the
formation of a five-residue loop in the model that deviates from the
protein backbone of a superimposed tonb structure (fig. 4c, arrow).
notably, the corresponding tonb residue in e. coli found at the
position of maximal structural deviation is gln160, which has been
previously shown to interact with the highly conserved ton box of
tonb-dependent outer membrane receptors14,18,19. variability in this
region is consistent with the direct interaction of the  xxxg1416xxx 
protein with a cognate protein partner through a motif different than
the ton box (supplementary note).
currently, eight different defects in cellular cobalamin metabolism
have been defined (complementation groups  xxxg1414xxx –cblh)1. the
cblc, cbld and cblf disorders result in combined methylmalonic
aciduria and homocystinuria. fibroblasts from cblf individuals accumulate unmetabolized free cncbl in lysosomes, and a defect in
lysosomal cobalamin transport in cblf has been hypothesized20.
both cblc and cbld fibroblast cells show normal receptor-mediated
endocytosis of the transcobalamin ii–cobalamin complex and normal
intralysosomal hydrolysis of transcobalamin ii, but cobalamin does
not accumulate in the lysosomes of these cells. the defects in both
cblc and cbld cells have been postulated to affect a step after cellular
cobalamin uptake but before the synthesis of adocbl and mecbl and
before the binding of the cobalamin coenzymes to their respective
apoproteins. it has been suggested that reduction of the central cobalt
atom of cobalamin and removal of the upper axial ligand are necessary
steps21. it is possible that the  xxxg1416xxx  gene product has a direct or
indirect role in removal of the upper axial ligand, reduction of
cobalamin, or both; this is a challenge for future studies.  xxxg1416xxx 
may be involved in the binding and intracellular trafficking of
cobalamin. further studies on colocalization and a search for novel
binding partners may help us to better understand the early steps of
cellular cobalamin metabolism.
methods
cell culture studies. for the past 22 years, cultured fibroblasts from individuals
suspected of having an inborn error of cobalamin metabolism have been sent to
our laboratory for clinical diagnosis and characterization. the unique identification codes assigned to cell lines by the repository for mutant human cell
strains at the montreal children’s hospital were used. referring physicians
indicated whether cell lines should not be used to pursue research into the
origin of these diseases. the procedure was approved by the royal victoria
hospital research ethics board. if physicians were contacted to request samples
of dna or cell lines from additional family members, informed consent was
obtained from the individual or his/her family.
cell culture studies were carried out on 215 cblc individuals (120 males; 94
females; one unknown). this collection of cblc cell lines included ten pairs of
affected siblings and one affected cousin-pair; 18 affected individuals were
reported to be offspring of first-cousin marriages, one was the offspring of a
second-cousin marriage and five had parents that were more distantly related.
only individuals considered to be unrelated were included in the mutation
analysis tabulations. this included 204 cblc individuals (118 males; 85 females;
one unknown). of these, 48% were of european ancestry, 17% hispanic, 17%
asian and 19% of other or unknown ethnicity.
fibroblasts from all individuals in this collection had decreased incorporation of label from [14c]propionate and 5-[14c]methyltetrahydrofolate into
cellular macromolecules (measuring function of methylmalonylcoa mutase
and  xxxg1479xxx , respectively) and decreased synthesis of both adocbl
and mecbl from exogenous [57co]-labeled cncbl. in all cases, diagnosis was
confirmed by complementation analysis22,23.
genotyping studies. dna was extracted from individual and control fibroblasts using the qiagen gdna extraction kit for cultured cells. the dna from

from cblc was used as a comparison group for homozygosity mapping to
control for bias of ascertainment of individual samples. initial studies used a
panel of 26 microsatellite markers selected from decode genetics and
marshfield genetic maps (supplementary table 1). markers were selected
within and flanking the interval between markers d1s3721 and d1s2134 on
chromosome 1p and were selected on the basis of length and purity of the
repeat unit. pcr performed in abi 9700 thermal cyclers (applied biosystems)
using fluorescently labeled primers to assay microsatellites gave products that
were visualized with automated sequencers (abi 3700 & 3730). an internal
size standard (genescan 400-rox for abi 3700 and genescan 500-liz for
abi 3730, applied biosystems) ensured accurate sizing. electropherograms
were analyzed with genotyper v.3.6 and genemapper v.3.7 software (applied
biosystems) to generate allele sizes. mendelian inheritance testing and
binning of alleles were done using pedmanagerw software, a modified version
of pedmanager.
sequencing studies. dna was amplified by pcr from gdna or cdna. for
sequencing analysis, 215 cblc individuals, 55 unrelated ceph controls and 50
controls (individuals with other inborn errors of cobalamin metabolism) were
included. of the 105 controls, 62% were of european ancestry, 24% hispanic,
12% asian and 2% of unknown ethnicity. primers used to amplify  xxxg1416xxx 
are listed in supplementary table 2. primers were designed using primer 3.0
software. cdna was prepared by whole-rna extraction from fibroblast
cultures using trizol reagent (molecular research center), and mrna was
reverse transcribed with moloney murine leukemia virus (mmlv) reverse
transcriptase (usb) or superscript reverse transcriptase (qiagen) and poly(dt)
oligonucleotides (amersham). pcr products were purified with montage
pcr96 filter plates (millipore). sequencing reactions (10 ml) contained 2 ml
purified pcr product, 1 ml bigdye terminator cycle sequencing version 3.1
(applied biosystems), 1.5 ml of 5 buffer, 5 ml h2o, and 0.5 ml (1 mm final) of
sense or antisense primer. products were analyzed on an abi 37301 dna
analyzer (applied biosystems). sequencing files were processed using sequence
analysis software (applied biosystems) and were assembled and analyzed using
the phred/phrap/consed system24,25.
haplotype analysis. snps and deletion/insertion polymorphisms (dips)
identified by sequencing of the  xxxg1416xxx  gene were used to construct
haplotypes. the frequencies of haplotypes inferred from 54 ceph controls
were obtained using phase v2.1.1 (refs. 8,9). haplotypes of cblc individuals
homozygous for  xxxg1416xxx  mutations could be deduced, as they were
heterozygous for at most one sequence variant.
expression of human  xxxg1416xxx  cdna in fibroblast cells. wild-type
 xxxg1416xxx  cdna was generated by rt-pcr from total rna extracted from
normal human fibroblasts and confirmed by sequencing. this product was
cloned into a gateway expression vector system (invitrogen) using the pentrtopo directional cloning kit as recommended by the manufacturer, then
subcloned into a plxsh retroviral vector26 containing gateway cloning
adaptors (invitrogen). fibroblast cell lines from two cblc individuals and
one control were immortalized with the e7 gene from human papilloma virus
type-16 and human telomerase as previously described27. immortalization of
these cell lines did not affect the cellular phenotype as assessed by
[14c]propionate and [14c]methyltetrahydrofolate incorporation into cellular
macromolecules and cobalamin distributions (data not shown). the retroviral
vector containing cdna was transiently transfected into a phoenix amphotrophic cell line (a gift from g.p. nolan, stanford university) using a hepesbuffered saline (hbs)/ca3(po4)2 method. individual and control fibroblasts
were infected 48 h later by exposure to virus-containing medium with
polybrene (4 mg ml 1) and were grown for 2 weeks in medium containing
100 u ml 1 of hygromycin. incorporation of label from radiolabeled propionate and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and measurement of cobalamin coenzyme
synthesis was performed on infected cells as described above.
modeling. the predicted amino acid sequence of  xxxg1416xxx  was aligned to
e. coli tonb on the basis of a partial sequence alignment of  xxxg1416xxx  residues
242–280 against tonb residues 119–156 of the salmonella typhimurium tonb
protein (p25945). the primary sequence of the c-terminal domain of e. coli
tonb (residues 152–239) was merged with this alignment on the basis of

homology to the s. typhimurium sequence. the alignment of the primary
sequence of  xxxg1416xxx  (residues 185–282) to the e. coli tonb sequence was
used as the input for the computer program modeller15 to obtain a threedimensional homology model of the c-terminal region of  xxxg1416xxx . the
model was refined by molecular dynamics routines, with incremental increases
in simulation temperature from 150 k to 1,000 k, followed by incremental
temperature decreases from 1,000 k to 300 k. the  xxxg1416xxx  model was
evaluated by the program procheck16 on an ibm intellistation m pro
workstation running red hat linux 9. the  xxxg1416xxx  model and the threedimensional structure of monomeric e. coli tonb (residues 152–239) were
structurally aligned in a pairwise manner by the program lsqman to obtain
normalized r.m.s.d. statistics17.
