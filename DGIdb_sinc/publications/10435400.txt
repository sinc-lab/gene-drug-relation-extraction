 xxxd2957xxx  binding to 5-ht1a receptors in the human brain
confirmed with positron emission tomography

received: 8 march 1999 / final version: 15 march 1999

abstract the augmentation effect of (–) xxxd2957xxx  as
used in combination with ssri to treat major depression
has been ascribed to blocking of dorsal raphe nucleus
cell body 5-ht autoreceptors. in this study, the radioligand [carbonyl-11c]way-100635 and positron emission
tomography were used to establish whether  xxxd2957xxx  at a
clinical dose level (10 mg s.o.d.) occupies 5-ht1a receptors in the human brain in vivo. three healthy males
were recruited and each subject was used as his own
control. the  xxxg1108xxx  occupancy was calculated
for the frontal and temporal cortex and the raphe nuclei,
using and a ratio analysis with the cerebellar cortex as
the reference region. maximal  xxxd2957xxx  plasma concentration was reached within 3 h after drug administration.
two hours after  xxxd2957xxx  administration, the regional  xxxg1108xxx  receptor occupancy was within the range 7–21% in
the three subjects. the study confirms that the 5-ht1areceptor may be a clinically significant target for  xxxd2957xxx .

introduction
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) are well
established for the treatment of anxiety disorders and depression (hyttel 1994; boyer 1995). enhancement of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-ht) neurotransmission
has been suggested to be a central mechanism for antidepressive treatment (baldwin and rudge 1995). the inb. andrée (✉) · c. halldin · l. farde

crease in extracellular serotonin (5-ht) produced by
ssris can, however, be attenuated by activation of somatodendritic 5-ht1a autoreceptors in the midbrain
raphe (artigas et al. 1996).
arylalkylamine, (–) xxxd2957xxx , is a combined 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht1a)/beta-adreno-receptor antagonist
with high affinity for central 5-ht1a receptors (ki=
6.4 nmol/l) (newman-tancredi et al. 1998). the drug
 xxxd2957xxx  has been suggested to facilitate the antidepressive response to ssri treatment (artigas et al. 1996).
these initial clinical findings have more recently been
supported by results from open-label and double-blind
studies (perez et al. 1997; zanardi et al. 1997; blier and
bergeron 1998).
the clinical augmentation effect of  xxxd2957xxx  has been
ascribed to selective antagonism of dorsal raphe nucleus
(drn) cell body 5-ht autoreceptors that markedly enhances the extracellular concentration of 5-ht. this hypothesis has received experimental support from preclinical studies showing that blockade of 5-ht1a-receptors
augments the ssri-mediated increase of extracellular
5-ht levels (romero et al. 1996a,b). an effect of  xxxd2957xxx  in the living primate brain was recently reported in a
positron emission tomography (pet) study in monkeys,
showing that  xxxd2957xxx  1 mg/kg iv induces a 60% 5-ht1a
receptor occupancy (farde et al. 1997).
in this study, the radioligand [carbonyl-11c]way100635 and pet were used to establish whether  xxxd2957xxx 
at clinical doses occupies 5-ht1a receptors in the human
brain in vivo.

materials and methods
the study was approved by the ethics and radiation safety committees of the karolinska hospital and performed in accordance
with the declaration of helsinki at the department of clinical
neuroscience the karolinska institute.
three male volunteers (subject a, b and c: aged 22, 23 and
21 years, respectively) were recruited and examined after giving
informed consent. they were healthy according to history, physical examination, psychiatric interview, electrocardiogram, blood
and urine analyses. prior to pet, each subject was examined on a

304
mri, signa advantage system (general electric, signa 1.5 t), for
determination of the individual anatomy of brain and skull. the
10 mg dose of  xxxd2957xxx  administered in this study was predicted to
give plasma concentrations within the same range as that of the
7.5 mg daily dose used in clinical settings (artigas et al. 1994;
blier and bergeron 1995).
 xxxd2957xxx  plasma concentrations
for determination of the plasma concentrations of  xxxd2957xxx , venous blood samples (10 ml) were taken at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 h
post-dose. the samples were drawn into heparin-treated glass
tubes, centrifuged and plasma was frozen at –20°c until analyzed
at the department of clinical pharmacology, huddinge hospital.
a high-performance liquid chromatography method (hplc) with
fluorescence detection after liquid-liquid extraction of  xxxd2957xxx 
was used together with metoprolol as an internal standard
(chmielowiec et al. 1991) (table 1).
pet determination of  xxxg1108xxx  occupancy
[carbonyl-11c]way-100635 was the radioligand used for pet-determination of  xxxg1108xxx  binding (pike et al. 1996; farde et
al. 1997, 1998). the specific radioactivity at time of injection was
>1000 ci/mmol (>37 gbq/µmol). in each pet measurement, a
sterile phosphate buffer solution (ph=7.4) of 184–217 mbq of
[carbonyl-11c]way-100635 was injected iv as a bolus, immediately followed by a 10 ml bolus of saline.
the pet system used was siemens ecat exact hr 47
(wienhard et al. 1994). for details on pet experimental procedure
and quantitative methods, see farde et al. (1998). two pet measurements were performed in each subject on the same day. the
first was a baseline measurement and the second was performed
2 h after drug administration at the time of expected maximal  xxxd2957xxx  plasma levels. each pet measurement lasted 69 min. regions of interest (rois) were defined for the temporal and the
frontal cortex, the raphe nuclei and for the cerebellum. receptor
occupancy was calculated for the time interval 33–63 min after radioligand injection in a ratio analysis, with the cerebellar cortex as
reference region for the free radioligand concentration in brain
(farde et al. 1998).

results
 xxxd2957xxx  plasma concentrations reached maximal values
(cmax) at 3, 1 and 2 h (tmax) in subjects a, b and c, respectively (table 1). the cmax was 46 ng/ml, 31 ng/ml
and 28 ng/ml in the three subjects, respectively. after administration of  xxxd2957xxx , [carbonyl-11c]way-100635
binding was lower in all regions, except for the cerebellum, when compared to the baseline measurement. the
regional  xxxg1108xxx  occupancy was calculated for
all subjects for the neocortical regions and the raphe nuclei, and varied between 7% and 29% (table 1).

discussion
the aim of the study was to determine regional 5-ht1a
receptor occupancy in the living human brain after oral
administration of 10 mg  xxxd2957xxx  (viskén). the maximal
 xxxd2957xxx  plasma concentrations (cmax) values were
reached within 3 h post-dose administration and within
the time of the pet measurements in two subjects (table
1). maximal  xxxd2957xxx  plasma concentration values were
46, 31 and 28 ng/ml for subjects a, b and c, respectively. this corresponds to a mean cmax concentration of
35 ng/ml (approximately 35 µg/l or 141 nm).
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2957xxx  have previously
been studied in healthy individuals after oral administration of 10 mg s.o.d. and 5 mg t.i.d., indicating that the
disposition of  xxxd2957xxx  is linear over the concentration
range studied (gugler and bodem 1978). at 5 mg t.i.d.
the mean steady state plasma concentration was 0.015
µg/ml (60 nm). in previous open-labelled and placebocontrolled  xxxd2957xxx /ssr/combination studies, the  xxxd2957xxx  dose administered has been 2.5 mg t.i.d. (blier and
bergeron 1995; tome et al. 1997; zanardi et al. 1997).

however, plasma concentrations have not been reported
from these studies. from the assumption of linear pharmacokinetics follows that a 30 nm mean steady state
plasma concentration of  xxxd2957xxx  can be expected at
2.5 mg t.i.d. this trough value is approximately one-fifth
of the maximal plasma concentration that was determined in the present study (cmax=161 nm). however,
given the short half-life of  xxxd2957xxx , 3–4 h (frishman
1983), the cmax of 2.5 mg t.i.d. should approach the cmax
of 10 mg s.o.d.
after the administration of  xxxd2957xxx , the binding of
the radioligand [carbonyl-11c]way-100635 was lower in
all regions except for the cerebellum. the reduced binding corresponds to a calculated regional  xxxg1108xxx 
occupancy between 7% and 29% (table 1). these data
are consistent with previous results from a study in primate brain showing inhibition of [carbonyl-11c]way100635 binding after pretreatment with a higher dose of
 xxxd2957xxx  (1 mg/kg) that was shown to occupy about 60%
of the 5-ht1a receptors (farde et al. 1997).
a strength of the study is that each subject was used as
his own control, which eliminates inter-individual variations in the numbers and distribution of 5-ht1a receptors
as a source of error in the calculated receptor occupancy.
the  xxxg1108xxx  occupancy was clearly higher than
the test-retest reproducibility shown for radioligands with
lower signal-to-noise ratios (nordström et al. 1992).
we conclude that  xxxd2957xxx , at a dose giving clinically
relevant plasma concentrations, occupies 5-ht1a receptors in the living human brain.
