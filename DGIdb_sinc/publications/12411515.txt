we have investigated the effects of volatile anaesthetics on electron transport chain activity in the
mammalian heart. halothane, isoflurane and  xxxd3197xxx  reversibly increased nadh fluorescence
(autofluorescence) in intact ventricular myocytes of guinea-pig, suggesting that nadh oxidation
was impaired. using pig heart submitochondrial particles we found that the anaesthetics dosedependently inhibited nadh oxidation in the order: halothane > isoflurane =  xxxd3197xxx .
succinate oxidation was unaffected by either isoflurane or  xxxd3197xxx , indicating that these agents
selectively inhibit complex i (nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase). in addition to inhibiting nadh
oxidation, halothane also inhibited succinate oxidation (and succinate dehydrogenase), albeit to a
lesser extent. to test the hypothesis that complex i is a target of volatile anaesthetics, we examined
the effects of these agents on nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase ( xxxg1541xxx   xxxg1542xxx   xxxg1543xxx   xxxg1547xxx   xxxg1548xxx   xxxg1549xxx   xxxg1550xxx ) activity using the
ubiquinone analogue dbq (decylubiquinone) as substrate. halothane, isoflurane and  xxxd3197xxx 
dose-dependently inhibited nadh:dbq oxidoreductase activity. unlike the classical inhibitor
rotenone, none of the anaesthetics completely inhibited enzyme activity at high concentration,
suggesting that these agents bind weakly to the ‘hydrophobic inhibitory site’ of complex i. in
conclusion, halothane, isoflurane and  xxxd3197xxx  inhibit complex i (nadh:ubiquinone
oxidoreductase) of the electron transport chain. at concentrations of ~2 mac (minimal alveolar
concentration), the activity of nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase was reduced by about 20 % in the
presence of halothane or isoflurane, and by about 10 % in the presence of  xxxd3197xxx . these
inhibitory effects are unlikely to compromise cardiac performance at usual clinical concentrations,
but may contribute to the mechanism by which volatile anaesthetics induce pharmacological
preconditioning.

depression of cardiac function is the most important sideeffect of commonly used volatile anaesthetics such as
halothane, isoflurane and  xxxd3197xxx . in an elaborate
review, rusy & komai (1987) discussed three major
mechanisms which could be responsible for the negative
inotropic action of volatile anaesthetics: (i) a reduction in
ca2+ availability, (ii) a decrease in responsiveness of the
contractile proteins to ca2+, and (iii) inhibition of mitochondrial function. since that time, studies using intact
cardiac muscle have convincingly shown that the volatile
anaesthetics halothane, isoflurane and  xxxd3197xxx  depress
contractility by decreasing both ca2+ availability and the
responsiveness of the contractile proteins to ca2+ (hanley
& loiselle, 1998; jiang & julian, 1998 a, b; harrison et al.
1999; davies et al. 2000; housmans et al. 2000; hannon et
al. 2001). these inhibitory actions decrease the energy
expenditure of the heart via the accompanying reduction
in the activity of the major cytosolic energy consumers

actomyosin-atpase and ca2+-atpase (schramm et al.
1994). whether volatile anaesthetics also decrease energy
supply by inhibiting mitochondrial atp synthesis remains
controversial and only modest progress has been made in
elucidating this question.
from previous work with isolated mitochondrial
preparations, halothane has been deduced to inhibit the
electron transport chain at complex i (hall et al. 1973; merin
et al. 1973; rusy & komai, 1987). consistent with inhibition
of complex i, an increase in nadh fluorescence evoked by
halothane, as well as by isoflurane, has been observed in
isolated ventricular trabeculae (hanley & loiselle, 1998) and
isolated, perfused hearts (kissin et al. 1983). it is therefore
tempting to speculate that nadh: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex i) may be a common target of volatile
anaesthetics such as halothane, isoflurane and  xxxd3197xxx .
we tested this hypothesis using intact isolated cardiomyocytes and submitochondrial particles.

methods
isolation of cardiac ventricular myocytes
myocytes were isolated as previously described (ray et al. 2002),
and the experiments were performed in accordance with the
animal welfare guidelines at the regierungspräsidium giessen. in
brief, guinea-pigs, weighing 300–350 g, were anaesthetized with
3–4 % isoflurane in oxygen and decapitated. isolated hearts were
attached to a cannula via the aorta and perfused for 5 min with
physiological salt solution (pss) containing (mm): 115 nacl, 5.4
kcl, 1.5 mgcl2, 0.5 nah2po4, 5 hepes, 16 taurine, 5 sodium
pyruvate, 15 nahco3, 1 cacl2 and 5 glucose (ph 7.4). subsequently,
the heart was perfused for 4–5 min with nominally ca2+-free
solution, followed by low ca2+ solution containing 0.6 mg ml_1
(~180 u ml_1) collagenase type i (sigma), 0.1 % bovine serum
albumin and 40–60 mm ca2+. after enzymatic digestion (5–7 min),
ventricular myocytes were dissociated by trituration with a widebore pipette in a ‘recovery’ solution containing (mm): 45 kcl, 70
potassium glutamate, 3  xxxd2534xxx , 15 kh2po4, 16 taurine, 10 hepes,
0.5 egta and 10 glucose (ph 7.4). after 60 min incubation in the
recovery solution, myocytes were resuspended in dulbecco’s
modified eagle’s medium (gibco brl).
nadh fluorescence
myocytes were placed in a perspex bath (volume, 100 ml) located
on the stage of an inverted microscope (diaphot 300, nikon) and
superfused via gravity flow (~1 ml min_1), or, during application
of volatile anaesthetics, via a syringe pump (1 ml min_1). the
volatile anaesthetics were prepared at final concentrations in pss.
the syringe pump (with a glass barrel) was connected to the bath
via stainless-steel tubing. the time constant of solution washout,
determined by measuring the decay of tetramethylrhodamine
ethyl ester (tmre) fluorescence, was 7.2 s. the bath was placed
on an electrically heated aluminium plate, which, in turn, was
attached to a perspex microscope stage insert. the temperature of
the metal plate was monitored via an embedded thermistor and
was maintained at 37 °c using a feedback circuit (tc-324a heater
controller, warner instrument corp., hamden, ct, usa). bath
temperature was continuously monitored via a second thermistor.
immediately prior to entering the bath, solutions passed through
a heat exchanger. the oil-immersion objective was heated to
37.5–38 °c with a brass water jacket.
myocytes were excited at 350 nm and nadh fluorescence
detected at 450 nm (bandwidth, 65 nm) using a deltascan 4000
fluorescence system (photon technology international, photomed,
seefeld, germany). note that the reduced form (nadh), but not
the oxidised form (nad+), of the redox couple nad+/nadh is
fluorescent. at the end of experiments, maximal nadh fluorescence
was obtained by addition of the selective nadh: ubiquinone
oxidoreductase inhibitor rotenone (10 mm).
electron transport chain activity
submitochondrial particles (smp; disrupted mitochondria) were
isolated from pig hearts (clark & switzer, 1977), freshly obtained
from an abattoir. in brief, minced ventricular tissue (including
remnants of the atria) was washed twice in a solution containing
10 mm potassium phosphate buffer and 1 mm edta (ph 7.4),
drained via cheesecloth and then homogenised in a cold room
(4 °c) in a solution containing 30 mm potassium phosphate and
1 mm edta (ph 7.4). the homogenate was then centrifuged at
1076 g (3000 r.p.m.) for 15 min using a cooled (4 °c) sorvall
centrifuge with a ss34 rotor. the supernatant (first supernatant)

j. physiol. 544.3

was stored on ice and the precipitate was homogenised and
centrifuged as previously, yielding a second supernatant. the first
and second supernatants were combined and the ph was reduced
to 6.6 by adding acetic acid. the combined supernatants were
centrifuged for 15 min at 7649 g (8000 r.p.m.). the precipitate
was washed once in ice water and then centrifuged for 5 min at
2988 g (5000 r.p.m.). the pellet was resuspended in a solution
containing 30 mm potassium phosphate buffer and 0.1 mm edta
(ph 7.4), and aliquots were stored at _25 °c. protein concentration
was determined by the lowry-folin method.
an aliquot of 100 mg of the submitochondrial particles was
suspended in phosphate buffer solution, containing (mm): 138
nacl, 2.7 kcl and 10 phosphate buffer (ph 7.4). the rate of
nadh oxidation was assessed by adding 800 mm nadh
(substrate) and using oxygen as an electron acceptor. a custommade clark-type oxygen electrode was used to measure the rate of
oxygen consumption. the electrode protruded into a temperaturecontrolled (25 °c) glass chamber (volume ~0.6 ml) which had a
neck of 1 mm diameter and contained a magnetic stirrer. succinate
oxidation was determined after adding 5 mm succinate. in
selected experiments, the succinate dehydrogenase activity of
complex ii was measured by monitoring 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (dcip) reduction at 578 nm in the presence of 5 mm
sodium cyanide and 1 mg antimycin a (mg protein)_1.
volatile anaesthetics were added from near saturating concentrations
in physiological nacl solution (mckenzie et al. 1995): halothane
(13.6 mm), isoflurane (14.2 mm) and  xxxd3197xxx  (12.7 mm). the
stock solutions were prepared by injecting the anaesthetic into a
gas-tight syringe (aesculap, germany) containing 10 ml of a
solution composed of (mm) 138 nacl, 2.7 kcl and 10 phosphate
buffer (ph 7.4). the solution in the sealed syringe was mixed for
15–20 min via a magnetic stirrer.
nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity
nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity was determined
essentially as previously described (okun et al. 1999). in brief,
nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity of bovine heart
submitochondrial particles, isolated as previously described
(smith, 1967; thierbach & reichenbach, 1981; okun et al. 1999),
was determined using the ubiquinone analogue decylubiquinone
(dbq) as substrate (lenaz, 1998). steady-state enzyme activity
was measured by monitoring nadh oxidation at 340–400 nm
(e340-400 nm = 6.10 mm_1 w cm_1) using a shimadzu uv-300 spectrophotometer. nadh (100 mm) and 50 mg of smp were added to
buffer solution containing 50 mm tris hcl (ph 7.4), 5 mm
kresoxim-methyl brio and 2 mm kcn. before addition of dbq,
anaesthetics (dissolved in dmso) were added via a hamilton gastight (1700-series) syringe combined with a pb-600 mechanical
dispenser. dmso did not inhibit nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity. the reaction was initiated by addition of 60 mm
dbq. the final volume of the reaction mixture was 1 ml.
experiments were performed at 30 °c.
volatile anaesthetics and minimal alveolar concentration
anaesthetic concentrations are expressed in millimoles per litre
and where appropriate, equivalent mac (minimal alveolar
concentration) values were estimated. mac expressed as volume
percentage (or percentage atmosphere) varies considerably with
temperature whereas the equivalent liquid–phase concentration,
expressed in millimoles per litre, changes little (franks & lieb,
1996). the equivalent mac values for our experiments were

calculated from the concentration of the anaesthetic and the
conversion factors reported for halothane (1 mac, 0.27 mm),
isoflurane (1 mac, 0.31 mm) and  xxxd3197xxx  (1 mac, 0.35 mm)
in rat at 37 °c (franks & lieb, 1996).
gas chromatography
anaesthetic concentrations were determined using a gas chromatograph (carlo erba, milan, italy) equipped with a flame ionisation
detector (fid). the carrier gas was hydrogen (60 kpa column
head pressure) and the fused silica capillary column, coated with
polysiloxane se-30, was 25 m w 0.25 mm. injector temperature
was 250 °c, fid temperature was 300 °c and the oven was
maintained at 90 °c. a mixture of halothane, isoflurane and
 xxxd3197xxx  in dmso was used as internal standard.
statistics
results were analysed by two-way analysis of variance. differences
among means were tested for statistical significance (p < 0.05).
data are expressed as means ± s.e.m.

81.1 ± 3.8 % (n = 5) of control;  xxxd3197xxx  (0.9 mm,
~2.6 mac) decreased enzyme activity to 84.8 ± 5.8 %
(n = 5) of control. the effects of isoflurane and  xxxd3197xxx 
were not significantly different.
when succinate was used as substrate, neither isoflurane
(1.9 mm) nor  xxxd3197xxx  (1.7 mm) decreased the rate of
oxygen consumption of the submitochondrial particles
(not shown). hence, we can infer that isoflurane and
 xxxd3197xxx  do not inhibit complex ii, iii or iv. however,
halothane (1.8 mm) decreased the rate of oxygen
consumption to 77.3 ± 3.1 % of control (n = 4) when
succinate was used as substrate (not shown). in order to
differentiate between inhibition at complex ii versus
complexes iii and iv, we examined the effect of halothane
(1.8 mm) on the activity of succinate dehydrogenase, the
catalytic component of complex ii. halothane inhibited

results
nadh fluorescence measurements in cardiac
myocytes
we tested whether inhibition of complex i can be observed
in intact cardiac ventricular myocytes. inhibition of complex
i would be expected to cause a decrease in the nad+/nadh
ratio. consistent with inhibition of complex i, fig. 1 shows
that the volatile anaesthetics induced a reversible increase
in nadh fluorescence. to scale these effects, myocytes
were exposed to the specific complex i inhibitor rotenone,
which elicited maximal nadh fluorescence. the inhibitory
action of rotenone was not reversible. on average, halothane
(1.5 mm, ~5.6 mac), isoflurane (1.5 mm, ~4.8 mac) and
 xxxd3197xxx  (1.5 mm, ~4.3 mac) increased nadh
fluorescence to 31.7 ± 7.8 % (n = 4), 25.1 ± 6.0 % (n = 4) and
14.3 ± 2.3 % (n = 4) of maximum, respectively. following
washout of each volatile anaesthetic, a small transient
increase in nadh fluorescence was observed. the cause of
this secondary effect is unclear.

oxidation of nadh and succinate by
submitochondrial particles
the increase in nadh fluorescence seen in myocytes
suggests that volatile anaesthetics impair mitochondrial
nadh oxidation. using pig heart submitochondrial
particles, we tested the effects of the volatile anaesthetics
on both nadh and succinate oxidation. halothane,
isoflurane and  xxxd3197xxx  inhibited the rate of nadh
oxidation in a concentration-dependent fashion (fig. 2).
halothane was the most potent inhibitor. at a concentration
of 0.9 mm (~3 mac), halothane decreased the rate of
nadh oxidation to 67.5 ± 1.0 % (n = 5) of control. at the
highest concentration tested (1.8 mm), halothane decreased
the rate of nadh oxidation to 34.7 ± 1.8 % (n = 5) of
control. isoflurane and  xxxd3197xxx  had qualitatively
similar, but smaller effects on complex i (fig. 2). isoflurane
(1 mm, ~3.2 mac) decreased complex i activity to

the activity of succinate dehydrogenase, assessed using
dcip, by a comparable extent (79.7 ± 4.0 % of control;
n = 4; p > 0.05). thus, with succinate as substrate, the
inhibitory effect of halothane on oxygen consumption rate
can be accounted for by succinate dehydrogenase
(complex ii) inhibition.

measurement of nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase
(complex i) activity
the ability of volatile anaesthetics to reduce the rate of
nadh oxidation by submitochondrial particles suggested
that nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase is inhibited. we
therefore examined the effects of the volatile anaesthetics
on nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity using dbq
as substrate. after making exploratory measurements over
a wide range of concentrations to estimate the range in
which the anaesthetics affected complex i activity, an
incremental titration of 11–15 measurements was performed
in the range 0 to 10 mm for each anaesthetic. figure 3
shows the effects of the anaesthetics in the range of
concentrations used clinically (0–2 mm). halothane
decreased nadh:dbq oxidoreductase activity in a dosedependent fashion (fig. 3a). at much higher halothane
concentrations enzyme activity was not completely inhibited.
for example, at the highest concentration tested (10 mm),
activity was reduced to ~34 % of control (not shown).
similar to halothane, isoflurane (fig. 3b) and  xxxd3197xxx 
(fig. 3c) also inhibited nadh:dbq oxidoreductase activity,
albeit less potently. at very high concentrations (10 mm),
isoflurane and  xxxd3197xxx  decreased enzyme activity to,
respectively, ~56 and ~75 % of control (not shown). hence,
none of the anaesthetics completely inhibited enzyme activity
at very high doses.

anaesthetic titration (0–10 mm), were used in the fitting procedure.

volatile anaesthetics inhibit complex i

discussion

journal of physiology

the mechanism underlying the anaesthetic-induced
increase in nadh fluorescence
we have examined the effects of halothane, isoflurane and
 xxxd3197xxx  on electron transport chain activity in the
heart and tested the hypothesis that these agents inhibit
complex i (nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase). as far as
we are aware, there are no previous studies examining the
effects of isoflurane and  xxxd3197xxx  on either nadh
oxidation or nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity.
consistent with complex i inhibition, we found that all
three volatile anaesthetics reversibly increase nadh
fluorescence in cardiomyocytes. these results corroborate
and extend previous reports showing that inhalational
anaesthetics increase nadh fluorescence (alternatively
referred to as nadh autofluorescence) in isolated perfused
hearts or in cardiac ventricular trabeculae (kissin et al.
1983; jiang & julian, 1997; hanley & loiselle, 1998; riess et
al. 2002). we have elucidated the underlying cause of the
increase in nadh fluorescence using two approaches.
first, we found that halothane, isoflurane and  xxxd3197xxx 
inhibit nadh oxidation in pig heart submitochondrial
particles. second, we demonstrated that volatile anaesthetics
inhibit nadh:dbq oxidoreductase activity of bovine
submitochondrial particles.
at clinical concentrations (<1 mm), nadh:dbq oxidoreductase activity was more sensitive to inhibition by the
volatile anaesthetics than nadh oxidation. this difference
suggests that inhibition of complex i activity may be
underestimated by measurements of oxygen consumption
of submitochondrial particles. since dmso did not inhibit
nadh:dbq oxidoreductase activity, we were able to examine
the effects of high concentrations of volatile anaesthetics. at
concentrations as high as 10 mm, complex i activity was
reduced to 34, 56 and 75 % of control by, respectively,
halothane, isoflurane and  xxxd3197xxx . these results suggest
that volatile anaesthetics bind weakly to the ‘hydrophobic
inhibitory site’ (degli esposti, 1998; okun et al. 1999) of
complex i. succinate oxidation was not affected by isoflurane
or  xxxd3197xxx  suggesting that complexes ii, iii and iv were
not inhibited. however, halothane was found to inhibit both
complex i and succinate dehydrogenase, the catalytic
component of complex ii, as shown schematically in fig. 4.

functional implications
the nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase is the first stage of
proton and electron donation for nadh (fig. 4) and thus
is a potential source of electron leakage with the formation
of free radicals (turrens & boveris, 1980). recently, volatile
anaesthetics have been suggested to induce pharmacological preconditioning (i.e. to protect the heart against
subsequent ischaemic damage) via the production of
reactive oxygen species (ros; müllenheim et al. 2002;
novalija et al. 2002; tanaka et al. 2002). rotenone (and
other complex i inhibitors) has been shown to increase the
rate of production of ros by cardiac submitochondrial
particles (hasegawa et al. 1990; ide et al. 1999). furthermore,
the k+ channel openers  xxxd1868xxx  and pinacidil, which
have been widely used for pharmacological preconditioning,
have also been shown to inhibit components of the
respiratory chain (hanley et al. 2002). taken together,
these findings suggest that partial inhibition of the electron
transport chain may be a common mechanism by which
various drugs, including volatile anaesthetics and  xxxd1868xxx ,
induce preconditioning in mammalian heart.
we found that halothane, isoflurane and  xxxd3197xxx  dose
dependently inhibit nadh:dbq oxidoreductase activity.
at a concentration of ~2 mac (see fig. 3), enzyme activity
was reduced by about 20 % in the presence of halothane or
isoflurane and by about 10 % in the presence of  xxxd3197xxx .
since volatile anaesthetics are usually employed in
combination with ~0.7 mac nitrous oxide (n2o), a
concentration of ≥ 2 mac is seldom attained for a single
agent; the majority of anaesthetics are administered using
concentrations of < 1.5 mac. volatile anaesthetic
concentrations ≥ 2 mac are, nevertheless, delivered for
brief periods during inhalational induction (kwek & ng,
1997; epstein et al. 1998), a technique commonly employed
for children.
interestingly, nitrous oxide has been reported to decrease
the rate of succinate and  xxxg569xxx  oxidation by bovine
heart submitochondrial particles (sowa et al. 1987),
suggesting that it inhibits  xxxg569xxx  oxidase (complex
iv of the respiratory chain; see fig. 4). indeed, n2o
(≤ 100 %; equivalent to ≤ 1 mac at 37 °c) was found to
inhibit  xxxg569xxx  oxidase by up to 60 %, depending on
the  xxxg569xxx  concentration (einarsdóttir & caughey,

692

p. j. hanley, j. ray, u. brandt and j. daut

journal of physiology

1988; chervin & thibaud, 1992). thus, we estimate that
inhibition of the respiratory chain by 20–25 % could occur
when inhalational agents (including n2o) at ≥ 2 mac are
used to induce or maintain surgical anaesthesia.
despite its inhibitory effect on the electron transport
chain, halothane (1.5 %, corresponding to ~2 mac) was
found to produce no significant change in the steady-state
concentrations of phosphocreatine or atp in isolated
perfused rabbit hearts, either paced (murray et al. 1987) or
spontaneously beating (mcauliffe & hickey, 1987). however,
under these in vitro experimental conditions, halothane
decreased the rate pressure product by about 50 %, and
this negative inotropic effect, which decreases energy
demand, should have counterbalanced the partial inhibition
of the respiratory chain. the situation is quite different in
vivo, where negative inotropic effects are (at least partially)
compensated by an increased activation of the sympathetic
nervous system. during application of volatile anaesthetics
at a total concentration of ≥ 2 mac, the combination of
negative inotropy and partial inhibition of the respiratory
chain is expected to decrease cardiac reserve (the maximum
percentage that cardiac output can increase above
normal). this decrease in cardiac reserve is probably not
critical for most patients undergoing general anaesthesia,
and the major factor responsible for this reduction of
maximum cardiac output is the negative inotropic effect of
volatile anaesthetics. nevertheless, inhibition of the
respiratory chain (energy supply) by volatile anaesthetics
may limit cardiac output under pathophysiological
conditions, for example, during strong stimulation of the
sympathetic nervous system (which decreases the efficiency
of cardiac energy transduction; see graham et al. 1968;
gibbs, 1982), during recovery of the myocardium from
ischaemic episodes, or in patients with heart disease
(montgomery, 2000).
in conclusion, we have shown that halothane, isoflurane
and  xxxd3197xxx  inhibit nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase
(complex i) in a dose-dependent fashion. halothane, but
not isoflurane or  xxxd3197xxx , also inhibits succinate
oxidation and succinate dehydrogenase activity (complex
ii). although this inhibition of the respiratory chain is
unlikely to compromise cardiac performance at usual
clinical concentrations, it may contribute to the mechanism
by which volatile anaesthetics confer ischaemic-like
preconditioning.
