background: several factors, both clinical and
genetic, may account for the risk of developing
levodopa-induced peak-dose dyskinesias (pdd) in
patients with parkinson disease, but it is unclear how
these factors interact for modulating the individual susceptibility for pdd.
objective: to examine clinical and genetic risk factors
for determining individual susceptibility of pdd in patients with parkinson disease.
design: cohort study.

results: one hundred five patients (48.8%) exhibited pdd
following short-term levodopa administration, and 110 patients (51.2%) did not. multivariate logistic regression
analysis showed that independent predictors for the occurrence of pdd were female sex, earlier age at onset of
parkinson disease, longer duration of treatment, and higher
dose of levodopa. genetic factors related to the  xxxg656xxx  canstr polymorphism were not independent predictors for
pdd in the total population, but they had a strong protective effect on the appearance of pdd when the multivariate analysis was performed in men (odds ratio, 0.34
[95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.84]). in women, a genetic protective effect on pdd was not evident.

setting: referral center for parkinson disease in cala-

bria, southern italy.
patients: two hundred fifty patients with parkinson dis-

ease were screened for the presence or absence of pdd
following a short-term levodopa administration, and 215
subjects were available for further evaluations, including genotypic analysis of the ca dinucleotide short tandem repeat (can-str) polymorphism located in the  xxxg656xxx  gene ( xxxg656xxx ).

l

conclusions: risk factors for pdd, both clinical and genetic, act in different ways for men and women. genetic
factors related to the  xxxg656xxx  polymorphic status have a
protective effect on pdd development in men but not in
women. a female sex–related effect for the risk of pdd
may be so strong that it overcomes any protective effect
due to genetic factors.

evodopa-induced dyskine-

sias are frequent and disabling complications observed during long-term
treatment of patients with
parkinson disease (pd). there is no clear
consensus regarding the frequency of dyskinesias, but a recent analysis of previously published levodopa treatment series indicated that patients treated with
levodopa for 4 to 6 years have approximately a 40% likelihood of experiencing
dyskinesias.1 the development of dyskinesias has been reported to depend on several clinical risk factors, such as earlier age
at onset of pd,2 longer duration of disease,3 longer duration of levodopa treatment,4 higher levodopa dose,2,5 and fe-

male sex.6-8 nevertheless, these clinical
variables may only partially account for the
risk of developing dyskinesias, and a substantial proportion of patients with pd
never develop dyskinesias. genetic factors could contribute to the individual
variations in the development of dyskinesias, and we have previously reported that
certain alleles of an intronic polymorphism of the  xxxg656xxx 
( xxxg656xxx ) gene reduced the risk for the appearance of the most common type of levodopa-induced dyskinesias (ie, peakdose dyskinesias [pdd]). 9 to date,
however, the relationship between clinical and genetic factors in determining the
risk for the development of pdd during
levodopa therapy is still unknown. none-

theless, recognition of such a relationship may help to
clarify the mechanisms underlying individual susceptibility for pdd.
to identify putative risk factors for determining individual susceptibility of pdd, we examined the effect
of several clinical and genetic variables on the occurrence of pdd in a cohort of patients with pd.
methods

patients
two hundred fifty patients with pd participated in this study.
they were consecutively selected starting from january 1999
until june 2002 among the outpatients of the institute of neurology of the university “magna græcia” of catanzaro, italy.
inclusion criteria were (1) clinical diagnosis of pd according
to the united kingdom parkinson’s disease society brain bank
criteria10; (2) duration of levodopa treatment of a minimum of
6 months; (3) presence or absence of pdd observed following
a short-term levodopa administration, excluding patients with
other types of levodopa-induced dyskinesias, such as biphasic
dyskinesias and off-dose dystonia; and (4) no family history of
pd extended to the first-degree relatives. according to these
criteria, 27 patients were excluded from the study for the presence of biphasic dyskinesias (n=8), off-dose dystonia (n=7),
or family history of pd (n=12). another 8 patients refused to
participate in the study. therefore, 215 patients (123 men and
92 women; mean age±sd, 66.7±8.7 years) were included in
the present study. all patients were white, born in calabria
(southern italy), and gave a fully informed consent for the study.
peak-dose dyskinesias were recorded as present or absent
by the examining neurologist on the occasion of a short-term
oral levodopa test.11 briefly, the levodopa test consisted of a
6-hour observation by a trained neurologist after the morning
administration of a standard dose of 250 mg of levodopa plus
25 mg of carbidopa after a night not taking any drug and in a
fasting state. clinical status was assessed by means of the unified parkinson’s disease rating scale12 at baseline and at 30,
60, 90, 120, 240, and 360 minutes after levodopa administration. the following clinical characteristics were available for
all the patients: age, sex, weight, severity of the disease measured by the modified hoehn-yahr scale,12 age at onset of the
disease (defined as the first diagnosis made by a neurologist),
duration of disease, duration of levodopa therapy, and daily levodopa dose.

molecular genetic analysis
genotypic analysis of the intronic ca dinucleotide short
tandem repeat (can-str) polymorphism, located in intron 2
of the  xxxg656xxx  gene (1.25 kilobase upstream of exon 3),13 was
performed on all patients. genomic dna was prepared from
leukocytes harvested from whole blood with standard methods, and genotyping of the can-str polymorphism was performed as described.9 all genotyping was performed by individuals who were unaware of the clinical status of the
subjects.

statistics
statistical analysis was performed by considering the patients
as classified into 2 groups depending on the presence or absence of pdd. the clinical variables were compared between
the groups by means of the 2-sample, unpaired t test for continuous variables with approximate normal distribution, the

mann-whitney u test for nonparametric variables, and the ␹2
test for discrete variables. genotype and allele frequencies were
compared between the groups using crosstabulation and the
␹2 statistic, under the assumption of the hardy-weinberg equilibrium. to assess the contribution of each individual variable
on the appearance of pdd, univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed. the latter, a forward stepwise
procedure, was used to select the best set of independent predictors, with a criterion for entry of p⬍.25; only the variables
with p⬍.05 were kept in the model. the relative risk was estimated through calculation of odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.
results

of the 215 examined patients, 105 (48.8%) exhibited pdd
and 110 (51.2%) did not. only 8 patients with observed
pdd on the levodopa test did not report dyskinesias in
their medical history, whereas all the patients without
observed pdd did not historically report dyskinesias.
thus, the positive predictive value of pdd observed on
the levodopa test with regard to the historically reported dyskinesias was 92%, and the negative predictive value was 100%. clinical details of patients with dyskinetic and nondyskinetic pd are given in table 1.
subjects with dyskinesias were younger, had a femalesex preponderance, and weighed less than patients without dyskinesias; moreover, patients with pdd were more
disabled as measured by the hoehn-yahr scale,12 had an
earlier age at onset of pd and a longer duration of disease, were treated for a longer period with levodopa, and
took a larger daily levodopa dose than patients without
pdd. univariate logistic regression analysis showed that
age, female sex, body weight, hoehn-yahr score, age at
onset of pd, duration of the disease, duration of levodopa treatment, and levodopa dose were predictors for
the appearance of pdd.
in the can-str polymorphism, 4 alleles (characterized by the presence of 13, 14, 15, or 16 ca repeats) and
10 resulting genotypes were identified. the observed genotype frequencies did not differ from the expected frequencies according to the hardy-weinberg equilibrium
(p =.08). because of the low frequencies of some genotypes, subjects were categorized as 13,14⫹ or 13,14− (ie,
subjects carrying at least 1 of the 13 or 14 alleles in their
genotype or subjects carrying neither the 13 nor the 14
allele, respectively).9 in the total sample of examined patients (table 2), the genotypic distribution of the canstr polymorphism was significantly different between
patients with and without dyskinesias, and subjects carrying the 13,14⫹ genotype had a decreased risk for the
appearance of pdd. however, when the comparisons were
performed by considering the sex of subjects with and
without dyskinesias, only men carrying the 13,14⫹ genotype had a decreased risk for pdd, whereas in women
the genotypic status of the can-str polymorphism was
similar between subjects with and without dyskinesias
and did not influence the risk for pdd.
the multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed including clinical and genetic variables in the statistical model. the best set of independent predictors differed when considering the total sample or by analyzing

the total sample, independent predictors for the occurrence of pdd were female sex, age at onset of pd, duration of treatment, and levodopa dose; for men, the best
set of independent predictors for pdd included age at
onset of pd, 13,14⫹ genotype carrier status, levodopa
dose, and body weight; and for women, the only variable included in the model was age at onset of pd.
comment

this study highlights the role of several clinical and genetic factors in determining the occurrence of levodopainduced pdd in patients with pd. to our knowledge, this
is the first study attempting to investigate well-known
clinical risk factors for pdd together with factors involved in genetic susceptibility for pdd. our findings indicate that risk factors for pdd, both clinical and genetic, act in different ways for men and women. indeed,
we found that in men independent predictors for the occurrence of pdd were an earlier age at onset of pd, a peculiar polymorphic status in the  xxxg656xxx  gene, a larger daily

dose of levodopa, and a body weight less than 61 kg,
whereas in women only an earlier age at onset of pd best
predicted the occurrence of pdd. these data suggest a
sex-related effect on clinical and genetic risk factors associated with the development of pdd.
individual susceptibility to certain conditions, such
as pdd, may depend on the imbalance between factors
that increase or decrease the risk for that condition. in
our study, univariate analysis showed that many clinical variables were associated with an increased risk for
pdd, whereas the examined genetic factors provided evidence that some genotypes were protective against the
development of pdd. however, some of the tested clinical variables were related (age, age at onset, severity of
pd, disease duration, treatment duration, and levodopa
dose) and their effect on the occurrence of pdd vanished or decreased when they were entered into the multivariate logistic regression model. overall, in our total
population, the variables remaining in the model were
female sex, earlier age at onset, longer duration of treatment, and higher dose of levodopa. the most significant risk factor for pdd in multivariate analysis was fewww.archneurol.com

male sex, and women were more than 3-fold likely than
men to have pdd. it is unclear why women are more susceptible than men to develop pdd, as we and others have
reported,6-8 but there is evidence that the female hormonal status may underlie this susceptibility, possibly
by modifying the individual dyskinetic sensitivity to levodopa through estrogens.14
because in multivariate analysis the most important
risk factor for pdd was related to sex, we performed separate analyses for men and women. the only risk factor
for pdd shared by both men and women in separate multivariate analyses was an earlier age at pd onset, thus confirming the relevance of this factor for the occurrence of
levodopa-induced dyskinesias.2 differently from women,
the multivariate analysis showed that men had risk factors for ppd related to levodopa exposure. indeed, the
daily dose of levodopa, which is a well-known risk factor for pdd,2,5 and a lighter body weight were independent predictors for the occurrence of pdd. it has been
suggested that a lighter body weight could be related to
a greater levodopa exposure because lighter subjects had
greater levodopa plasma levels after drug administration as compared with heavier individuals.15 most important, genetic factors had a strong protective effect on
the appearance of pdd in men but not in women.
we have already demonstrated in a previous study that
individuals carrying at least 1 of the 13 or 14 alleles in
the can-str polymorphism had a decreased risk of developing pdd.9 in the present study, we extend previous observations showing that a genetic protective effect
against pdd was evident only in men. it is still unclear
why a noncoding polymorphism, such as the intronic canstr polymorphism, may affect the risk of developing dyskinesia. in the absence of any other evidence, we can hypothesize that this polymorphism might be closely linked
to a functional mutation that modifies the expression of
the  xxxg656xxx  gene, as others have already suggested.16 in this
light, further studies should examine common haplotypes at the  xxxg656xxx  locus.

in women, a genetic protective effect on pdd was not
evident. however, women had a 3-fold increased risk for
pdd than men, and this sex-related effect could be so
strong as to overcome any protective effect due to genetic factors. on the other hand, other factors, such as
those due to levodopa exposure, did not enter into the
multivariate model for women, thus suggesting that female sex mostly accounted for the risk of pdd and
strongly influenced other variables. this sex effect on pdd
may warrant further studies on other variables related to
the female sex, such as the factors involved in the reproductive function or in the genotypic status of genes coding for hormone receptors.
our findings, however, should be considered preliminary because there are a number of limitations to
the present study. first, the investigated sample was a
referral-based cohort, and as such, it may not be representative of the overall population of patients with pd.
second, it is uncertain whether experimentally provoked and observed dyskinesias following a short-term
levodopa test, such as in this study, are a good surrogate marker for dyskinesias that occur in patients
receiving long-term treatment; nevertheless, serial
monitoring of the motor response for several hours following administration of a standard levodopa dose is
typically informative, allowing discrimination of pdd
from other types of dyskinesias, and in our sample,
there was a good concordance between experimentally
observed and historically reported dyskinesias. third,
there are many other genetic factors (ie, genes involved
in dopaminergic transmission or other systems underlying the control of movement) and other nongenetic
variables (eg, drugs, hormones, substances such as coffee) that could influence the occurrence of pdd and
that have not been investigated in the present study.
nevertheless, our study, even with these limitations,
has practical implications. recognizing peculiar profiles
of risk for pdd may aid in improving strategies to prevent these troublesome complications. for instance,
drugs inducing fewer dyskinesias, such as dopamine
agonists, could be administered to subjects at greater
risk, whereas levodopa could be safely given to those
individuals who are at lower risk for pdd, mainly men
with a later onset of pd and carrying specific genetic
 xxxg656xxx  polymorphic variants. further studies are needed
to confirm these issues.
