in the carotid body involves selective
inhibition
of k+ channels in type i cells. we have investigated
whether cytochrome p-450 may act as an o2 sensor coupling
hypoxia to k+ channel inhibition,
by investigating
the actions
of p-450 inhibitors
to modulate
channel
activity (recorded
using patch-clamp
techniques)
in type i cells isolated from 8to 12-day-old
rat pups. the imidazole
antimycotic
p-450
inhibitors
 xxxd2640xxx 
and  xxxd1732xxx 
(l- 10 um) inhibited
the ca2+-activated
(kc,) and voltage-gated
k+ (k,) currents
in isolated type i cells. single-channel
recordings
indicated
that the kc, channels could be inhibited
directly by  xxxd2640xxx .  xxxd2640xxx 
also irreversibly
inhibited
ca2+ channel
currents.
by contrast, acute application
of the suicide substrate p-450 inhibitor,
1-aminobenzotriazole
(l-abt;
3 mm)
was without
effect on k+ or ca2+ currents. hypoxia (16-23
mmhg) reversibly
inhibited
k+ currents and prevented
the
inhibitory
actions of  xxxd2640xxx .
furthermore,
the inhibitory
actions of  xxxd2640xxx 
could be partially
reversed by hypoxia.
pretreatment
of cells for 60 min with 3 mm l-abt substantially reduced the inhibitory
actions of hypoxia on k+ currents. our results indicate that imidazole
antimycotic
p-450
inhibitors
can directly and nonselectively
inhibit ionic channels in type i cells but, more importantly,
provide evidence to
suggest that hypoxic inhibition
of k+ currents in type i cells is
mediated in part at least by cytochrome p-450.

studies
have
implicated
ion channels as playing a key role in the mechanisms by which 02-sensitive
tissues respond to hypoxia (2, 6-10, 13-17, 23-26,29,
34). a lowering of po, stimulates
type i cells of the
carotid body to secrete neurotransmitters,
an essential
step in the process of chemotransduction,
which ultimately leads to elevated ventilation
(9,10,25). hypoxia
also causes constriction of pulmonary vascular smooth
muscle, a unique vascular response, which allows blood
to be diverted to better ventilated regions of lung tissue
(27, 32, 37). in both of these tissues, patch-clamp
studies on isolated cells have revealed hypoxia to
inhibit plasma membrane k+ channels (6-8,13,x&
17,
23, 27, 29, 34, 37), which leads to cell depolarization,
opening of voltage-gated
ca2+ channels and hence ca2+
influx and the consequent enhancement
of neurosecretion in the case of type i carotid body cells or vasoconstriction in the pulmonary
vasculature
(9, 10, 14, 25,
32)
at present, it is not known how hypoxia leads to k+
channel inhibition
in either the carotid body or the
pulmonary
vasculature.
various candidate transduction mechanisms have been proposed in type i carotid

body cells (9, 10, 25, 32), but findings to date are
incomplete
and indeed there is no consensus as to
whether this effect is membrane delimited (17) or has
an absolute requirement
for cytosolic mediators (34).a
recent study has suggested that cytochrome p-450, a
family of heme-linked
monooxygenase enzymes which
utilize nadph as an electron donor (l&20), may be an
“02 sensor” involved in hypoxic inhibition
of k+ channels in isolated pulmonary
smooth muscle cells (39).
such a conclusion was based on the fact that structurally and mechanistically
distinct p-450 inhibitors were
able to reversibly inhibit k+ currents in these cells and
to cause membrane depolarization
sufficient to activate
voltage-gated
ca2+ currents (39). we have therefore
adopted this pharmacological
approach to investigate
whether cytochrome p-450 is involved in the regulation
of type i carotid body cell k+ currents. our findings
suggest that some p-450 inhibitors can directly affect
ion channels in type i cells, but suggest also that they
can interfere with hypoxic inhibition
of k+ channels.
this latter observation provides evidence that p-450
may be involved in the regulation
of k+ channel
activity in type i carotid body cells by po,.
methods
the isolation and culture of type i carotid body cells was as
previously
described (34-36). in brief, 8- to 12-day-old wistar
rat pups (4/preparation)
were anesthetized
by breathing
5%
halothane-95%
o2 through
a face mask, and carotid bodies
were removed into phosphate-buffered
saline containing
50
um ca2+ 0 05% collagenase (lorne laboratories),
and 0.0200.025% trypsin (sigma). when all eight carotid bodies were
removed, they were placed in a humidified
incubator
at 37°c
for 20 min, teased apart with fine forceps, and then incubated
for a further 7 min. the digested tissue was then triturated,
centrifuged
at 200 g for 5 min, and resuspended
in ham’s
f-12 medium
containing
insulin
(80 u/l), penicillin
(100
iu/ml>, streptomycin
(100 ug/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum
(gibco). the isolated cell suspension was then placed onto a
polylysine-coated
coverslip; the cells were allowed to settle
and adhere for 2 h and were kept in the incubator for up to 30
h before being used for experiments.
single-channel
and whole cell techniques
were used to
record ionic channel activity in type i cells (12). on each day,
pieces of coverslip
were placed in a recording
chamber
(volume 80 ul) and continually
perfused (at - 1 ml/min) with a
standard
extracellular
solution of the following
composition
(in mm): 135 nacl, 5 kcl, 1.2 mgsod, 2.5 cac12, 5 2v-2hydroxyethylpiperazine-n’-2-ethanesulfonic
acid (hepes),
and 10 glucose (ph 7.4, 21-24°c).
in some experiments,
cac12 was reduced to 0.1 mm and mgsod was raised to 6 mm
to record voltage-gated
k+ currents without activating
ca2+dependent
k+ currents as has been demonstrated
previously
(24, 26). for recording
all k+ currents, the pipette solution
was composed of (in mm) 117 kcl, 1 cac12, 2 mgs04, 10 nacl,
11 ethylene glycol-bis( p-aminoethyl
ether)-n,n,n’,n’-tetraacetic acid (egta),
11 hepes,

4-8 mo. single k+ channel
recordings were made using outside-out
patches (12) exposed
to the standard bathing solution, and pipettes were filled with
the same solution as for whole cell recordings
except that the
added cac12 was 8.72 mm, calculated to yield a free [ca2+] of
1 um (using camg software, w. h. martin, yale university).
to record current
flowing through
ca2+ channels
in type i
cells, the perfusate
was composed of (in mm) 110 nacl, 5
cscl, 0.6 mgc12, 10 bac12, 5 hepes,
10 glucose, and 20
tetraethylammonium
(ph 7.4, 21-24”c),
and the patch pipettes contained
(in mm) 130 cscl, 1.1 egta, 2 mgc12, 0.1
cac12, 10 nacl, 10 hepes, and 2 atp (ph 7.2).  xxxd2640xxx 
and  xxxd1732xxx 
were freshly dissolved each experimental
day as 20 mm stock solutions
in methanol
and acetone,
respectively.
these vehicles, even at the highest concentrations tested (0.05% for methanol
and 0.015% for acetone)
were without
significant
effect on currents
when applied
alone (n = 6 cells tested for each vehicle, data not shown).
1-aminobenzotriazole
was dissolved directly into the perfusion solution. solution ph was adjusted to 7.4 where necessary after the addition of drugs.
hypoxic solutions were obtained
as previously
described
(34) by bubbling
the reservoir,
which led to the perfusion
chamber,
continuously
with 100% n2, and also passing a
stream of n2 over the surface of the chamber during perfusion
with hypoxic solutions. the stable po, levels reached (always
within 1 min of solution exchange) ranged from 16-23 mmhg
between experimental
days, as measured
with a needle o2
electrode (strathkelvin
instruments).
for whole cell recordings,
cells were voltage clamped at
-70 mv and step depolarized
(pulsed) to various test potentials for 50 ms at a frequency of 0.2 hz. evoked currents were
filtered at 1 or 2 khz and digitized at 5 khz before storage on
computer
disk. all voltage pulse protocols and data acquisition were performed
using the pclamp
software suite (version 6.0.2, axon instruments)
in combination
with a digidata
1200 interface
board (axon instruments).

were

direct inhibition
of k+ and ca2+ channel currents by
imidaxole antimycotic p-450 inhibitors.
bath application of  xxxd2640xxx ,
an imidazole antimycotic
p-450
inhibitor, caused a time and concentration-dependent
inhibition of k+ currents in isolated type i cells. this is
exemplified
in fig. la, which shows representative
currents evoked in a type i cell before  xxxd2640xxx , after
1 and 3 min exposure to the drug, and then after 2-min
washout.
current
inhibition

activating test potentials, as exemplified by the currentvoltage relationships

and although  xxxd2640xxx  was without significant effect
at 1 um, reductions caused by 3 and 10 um  xxxd2640xxx 
were statistically
significant at both times measured
(see legend for details). washout of the drug resulted in
small, incomplete recovery of current amplitudes (e.g.,

was used (fig. 2); for example, at a test potential of
+10-mv currents were reduced by 31.8 t 5.5% (p <
0.02) at 1 min and by 42.4 -+ 5 .2% at 3 min (p < 0.002,
n = 7 cells tested). thus the imidazole antimycotic class
of cytochrome p-450 inhibitors
were able to cause
reductions in k+ current amplitudes in type i carotid
body cells, as has been shown in pulmonary
vascular
myocytes (39).
the observation that  xxxd2640xxx  caused -80% current inhibition
 xxxd1891xxx  pm when applied for 3 min
suggested that it was not selectively inhibiting
either
the ca2+-dependent
or ca2+-independent,
voltagegated k+ currents known to be present in these cells
&+a and 1%, respectively) since each component contributes, on average, -50% to the total whole cell k+
current (refs. 22-24; the proportion
of each component, however, varies considerably
from cell to cell,
giving rise to variations in the size of outward current
shoulders seen at low, positive test potentials; compare
for example figs. 1b and 2). to investigate this further,
we examined the egects of  xxxd2640xxx  on 1% recorded in
isolation, using high [mg2+] (6 mm), low [ca2+] (0.1
mm) solutions. under these conditions, ca2+ influx is
effectively inhibited, preventing
significant activation
of 1% (22-24). as exemplified in fig. 3, under these
conditions  xxxd2640xxx  caused strong inhibitions
of 1%.
in seven cells examined, 3 pm  xxxd2640xxx  reduced 1%
by 26.3 t 6.9% after 1 min (p < 0.01, as determined at a
test potential of +lo mv> and by 54.0 5 8.5% at 3 min
(p < 0.002). at lo;um,  xxxd2640xxx  blocked 92.5 t 5.0%
of 1% after 1 min (data not shown). these findings
suggested that imidazole antimycotic p-450 inhibitors
can block both $,, and 1% in type i cells.
apparent
or indirect blockade of 1% can occur in
type i cells by agents which block voltage-gated
ca2+
channel currents (ica; refs. 22-24). to examine the
possibility of whether  xxxd2640xxx  only caused reductions in 1k as a result of ca2+ current blockade, we
recorded 1ci using 10 mm ba2+ as charge carrier, to
amplify currents

carrier (35). figure 4 shows one such representative
recording, illustrating
the effects of 3 um  xxxd2640xxx 
after 3 min application. at this concentration,
 xxxd2640xxx  was without effect after 1 min, but after 3 min
caused significant,
irreversible
inhibition
of ica. for
example, at 0 mv (where the peak ofica most commonly
occurred), ica was reduced by 38.6 t 4.6% (p < 0.01,
n = 6).  xxxd1891xxx  um,  xxxd2640xxx  reduced lca by 83.2 ? 8.0%
(p < 0.0001, n = 5) when applied for 1 min. thus the
inhibition

 xxxd1732xxx ) cou ld be attributable,
at least in part, to
the observed inhibition of&. however, a direct effect of
these drugs on 1& _ could not at this stage be discounted. we investigated

patches voltageclamped at +30 mv using pipette solutions containing
1 um free [ca2+] to enhance kc, channel activity. kc,
channels could be readily identified under these conditions by their amplitude
(recorded at a membrane
potential of +30 mv), compared with previous, recent
studies from this laboratory (34). in all nine separate
patches studied, we found that  xxxd2640xxx  (10 um)
could directly block kc, channels (e.g., fig. 5, a and b):
under control conditions, single-channel openings could
be clearly resolved (fig. 5a, top trace), but in the
presence of  xxxd2640xxx 
these openings were interrupted, giving rise to frequent, rapid transitions
back
to baseline during a given opening (fig. 5a, bottom
trace). this is more readily observed in fig. 5b, which
shows two representative
channel openings from the
same recording as in fig. 5a on an expanded timebase.
under control conditions, open channels made infrequent, very rapid closures, but in the presence of
 xxxd2640xxx  these periods of closure were longer and far
more frequent.
the examples given in fig. 5 are
representative
of 9 such patches, but we often observed
other channel types (of -2-3 pa amplitude), which precluded a detailed kinetic analysis. despite this, we have
clearly shown that  xxxd2640xxx  does have a direct, inhibitory action on single kc, channels in type i cells. thus
this p-450 inhibitor is capable of blocking both types of
k+ channel and also ca2+ channels in these cells.

type i cells were repeatedly step-pulsed from -70 to

inhibition
of k+ currents (i-= 16, p < o.ol),in good
agreement with previous studies from this laboratory

inihibited by 3 um  xxxd2640xxx , then exposed to hypoxia

caused a partial reversal of current amplitudes, so that
they were only inhibited by 39.4 t 3.4% compared with

effects of 1-abt on k+ and ca2+ channel currents in
normoxia and hypoxia. following the approach ofyuan
et al. (39), we have also examined whether the above
effects of  xxxd2640xxx  and  xxxd1732xxx  were mediated
by cytochrome p-450 inhibition,
by comparing
their
actions with those of 1-aminobenzotriazole
(labt).
this compound is structurally
unrelated to the imidazole antimycotics
and inhibits p-450 by a different
mechanism of action (11, 20). at a concentration
of 3
mm [3-fold higher than in the studies of yuan et al.
(39)], we found it to be without effect at 1 or 3 min on
whole cell k+ currents in solutions of normal [ca2+]
and [mg2+] which are comprised of both 1% and 1%
(e.g., fig. 7a, representative
of 5 cells examined). this

lack of effect suggested that 1-abt was also ineffective
on kh, and this suggestion was confirmed in a further 5
cells (exemplified
in fig. 7b) in which lca was not
significantly
affected by 3 mm l-abt. however, in an
intact lung preparation,
1-abt has been demostrated
to inhibit p-450 by ~70% only after 60 min of drug
exposure (18). we therefore incubated cells at room
temperature
with 3mm l-abt and, in its continued
presence, examined the effects of hypoxia on k+ currents. figure 7, c and d, shows that after such
treatment,
the inhibitory
actions of acute hypoxia
(11.3 t 2.9% inhibition,
n = 6) were significantly
diminished (p < 0.02, unpaired t-test) compared with
untreated
cells (see fig. 6a). this finding provides
evidence to suggest a role for p-450 in mediating
hypoxic inhibition of k+ currents in type i cells.

p-450

inhibitors

and

carotid

membrane potential in pulmonary
smooth muscle cells
(30, 32, 39). this family of heme moiety-containing
enzymes utilizes nadph
as an electron donor to
generate reactive oxygen species which influence cellular redox status. this in turn may control k+ channel
activity by influencing
the ratio of reduced to oxidised
intracellular
glutathione,
since glutathione
has been
shown to regulate k+ channels of pulmonary myocytes
(32, 39), with  xxxd2213xxx 
causing channel
inhibition. in this way p-450 may act as an o2 sensor in
the pulmonary vasculature.
numerous
comparisons
have been drawn between
the actions of hypoxia on pulmonary
smooth muscle
cells and carotid body type i cell k+ channels, despite
the lack of consensus concerning the channel identity
in these tissues (14,25,32).
thus o2 regulation of type i
cell glutathione
levels via a cytochrome-linked
nadph
oxidase has been proposed (1, 5),  xxxd2213xxx 
has been demonstrated
to inhibit k+ channels from
rabbit type i cells when applied to the intracellular
aspect of isolated membrane patches (2), and evidence
for a carbon monoxide-sensitive
(heme-based) o2 sensor linked to k+ channels in rabbit type i cells has been
presented (16). to examine whether p-450 may be
involved in the regulation of k+ channel activity in type
i cells, we therefore
followed the experimental
approach ofyuan et al. (39) and investigated
the ability of
structurally
distinct p-450 inhibitors to modulate ionic
channels in isolated type i cells of the neonatal rat
carotid body. yuan et al. (39) showed that p-450 inhibited imidazole antimycotics
and l-abt inhibited
k+
currents
and caused depolarization
in pulmonary
smooth muscle cells in a manner similar to hypoxia.
however, it should be noted that, whereas these findings suggest an important
role for p-450 in o2 sensing
by pulmonary smooth muscle cells, hypoxic reactivity of
this tissue has been demonstrated
after (but not during) l-abt exposure at a time when p-450 activity was
reduced to 26% of control levels (4a).
as we have previously reported for hypoxia (23, 24),
application of  xxxd2640xxx  and  xxxd1732xxx  caused inhibition of k+ currents in type i cells (figs. 1 and 2).
however, several lines of evidence suggest that this
inhibition was distinct from previously reported actions
of hypoxia. firstly, the time course of  xxxd2640xxx ’s
action was relatively slow, inhibition at 3 min being far
greater than at 1 min (fig. 1c). this contrasts with the
actions of hypoxia which are far more rapid (refs. 16,
23, see also fig. 6, a and b), although the delay might
be attributed
in part to the time taken for these
compounds to permeate the cell. more striking, however, was the observation that  xxxd2640xxx  blocked both
been
iqa and ikg whereas hypoxia has previously
shown to selectively inhibit 1% in this species (23).
furthermore,
hypoxic inhibition of 1k has been shown
at the single-channel
level to requireaas yet unidentified cytosolic factors (34), whereas  xxxd2640xxx  clearly
inhibited single kc, channels in cell-free, excised patches
(fig. 5). the inhibition
of lca by  xxxd2640xxx  (fig. 4)
would also argue against a mechanism of action similar
to that of hypoxia, since several reports have indicated

body

ion

channels

that ca2+ channels in type i cells are unaffected by po,
levels which inhibit k+ channels (13, 15, 17). however,
most recently hypoxia has been shown to inhibit lca in
type i cells of adult rabbit carotid bodies (19) and also to
modulate ic, in pulmonary
smooth muscle cells (31).
these findings complicate the interpretation
of hypoxic
k+ channel inhibition
as a fundamental
step in a
mechanism
for chemotransduction,
and suggest that
the relationship
between channel regulation
and cell
function (neurosecretion
for type i cells, vasoconstriction for pulmonary smooth muscle) is complex.
despite the above described effects of  xxxd2640xxx ,
results presented in fig. 6 suggest that p-450 may
indeed be involved in hypoxic inhibition of k+ currents
in type i cells. firstly, the effects of  xxxd2640xxx  were
dramatically
reduced in the presence of hypoxia (fig.
6b), and, secondly, the effects of  xxxd2640xxx , applied in
normoxia,
were partially
reversed when cells were
made hypoxic (fig. 6c). metabolism of drugs by hepatic
p-450 can be dramatically
inhibited by hypoxia (33),
and the results illustrated
by fig. 6, b and c, could be
explained by hypoxia acting at p-450 to cause a conformational
change which prevented
 xxxd2640xxx  from
binding. in so doing, this might prevent the drug from
exerting a p-450 mediated inhibition
of k+ currents,
although a direct effect of  xxxd2640xxx  on channels may
still be apparent (fig. 5).
such an interpretation
is speculative at present, and
requires further experimentation.
however, the conclusion implied, that p-450 may be involved in hypoxic
inhibition of k+ channels, is strongly supported by the
results obtained from studies with l-abt. this “suicidesubstrate” cytochrome p-450 inhibitor, which is structurally and mechanistically
distinct from the imidazole
antimycotic p-450 inhibitors
(11, 20, 39), was without
effect on ionic currents in type i cells when applied
acutely (fig. 7, a and b). however, pretreatment
of
cells with l-abt for 60 min markedly attenuated
the
inhibitory
actions of hypoxia on k+ currents. this
finding in itself supports the idea that inhibition
of
p-450 prevents hypoxic inhibition
of k+ currents, and
lends support to the idea that the actions of  xxxd2640xxx 
may be, in part, mediated by an 02-sensitive interaction with p-450.
our results are distinct from the findings of yuan et
al. (39), who described inhibitory
actions of  xxxd1732xxx ,  xxxd2640xxx  and l-abt on voltage-gated
k+ currents in pulmonary smooth muscle cells, since we found
no inhibitory
effects of 1-abt in normoxia when applied acutely. these authors did not investigate
any
inhibitory
actions of the above agents on &, nor did
they discount direct (as opposed to p-450-mediated)
effects of these drugs. indeed, there is evidence that
 xxxd1732xxx 
can displace radiolabelled
charybdotoxin
from kc, channels in erythrocytes
(3), which would
suggest a direct interaction
of  xxxd1732xxx 
with the
channel protein. also, no interactive studies were made
between p-450 inhibitors and hypoxia on k+ currents.
nevertheless,
their finding that structurally
distinct
p-450 inhibitors inhibit k+ currents at the whole cell
level in a manner comparable to the actions of hypoxia

p-450

inhibitors

and

carotid

(37-39) is supportive of a role for p-450 as an o2 sensor
in the pulmonary vasculature. our studies have demonstrated nonspecific inhibitory actions of imidazole antimycotic cytochrome p-450 inhibitors
on ikc,, 1% and
lca in isolated rat type i carotid body cells, and in the
case of kc, channels at least, this inhibition
can be
attributed
in part to a direct channel blockade. more
importantly,
however, we have demonstrated
that the
effects of  xxxd2640xxx  can be inhibited by hypoxia and
also that l-abt (ineffective
alone at inhibiting
k+
currents) attenuates
hypoxic inhibition
of currents.
these findings, therefore,
support a role for p-450 in
mediating the regulation of k+ channels in type i cells
by hypoxia, and in so doing suggest similarities in the
mechanism of hypoxic channel regulation in the pulmonary vasculature and the carotid body. this conclusion
for an important
role for p-450 in either tissue should,
however, be accompanied by a note of caution, since
conclusions are unavoidably based on the selectivity of
the compounds
used for p-450 over other cellular
components.
in this respect, it is noteworthy
that
imidazole
(structurally
related
to  xxxd2640xxx 
and
 xxxd1732xxx ) can reversibly inhibit a b type cytochrome
in neutrophils (13a), and a b type cytochrome has been
previously implicated as the o2 sensor in the intact rat
carotid body (1, 5). definitive identification
of specific
cytochromes coupling o2 sensing to k+ channel inhibition in pulmonary smooth muscle and the type i carotid
body cell must therefore await the development of more
specific pharmacological
tools.
