abstract
the accompanying multivariate analysis of the binding profiles of
antiparkinson agents revealed contrasting patterns of affinities at
diverse classes of monoaminergic receptor. herein, we characterized efficacies at human (h)d2short(s), hd2long(l), hd3, and
 xxxg1036xxx .4 receptors and at h␣2a-, h␣2b-, h␣2c-, and h␣1a-adrenoceptors (ars). as determined by guanosine 5⬘-o-(3-[35s]thio)triphosphate ([35s]gtp␥s) binding, no ligand displayed “full” efficacy
relative to dopamine (100%) at all “d2-like” sites. however, at
hd2s receptors quinpirole, pramipexole,  xxxd3145xxx , quinerolane,
pergolide, and cabergoline were as efficacious as dopamine
(emaxⱖ100%); tl99, talipexole, and apomorphine were highly efficacious (79 –92%); piribedil,  xxxd2498xxx , bromocriptine, and terguride showed intermediate efficacy (40 –55%); and roxindole displayed low efficacy (11%). for all drugs, efficacies were lower at
hd2l receptors, with terguride and roxindole acting as antagonists. at hd3 receptors, efficacies ranged from 33% (roxindole) to

although treatment of parkinson’s disease has long centered on administration of the dopamine precursor l-dihydroxyphenylacetyl acid (l-dopa), there is increasing interest in the therapeutic use of dopaminergic agonists, both in
association with l-dopa and as monotherapy (hughes,
1997). inasmuch as dopaminergic agents currently used as
antiparkinson agents interact principally with “d2-like” receptors, an important question concerns their comparative
actions at d2 receptors (of which functionally distinct short
d2s and long d2l isoforms exist), d3 receptors, and d4 receptors. d2s versus d2l receptor isoforms differ in both their
localization and their functional roles. the d2s isoform is
principally responsible for presynaptic control of dopamine

94% (tl99), whereas, for  xxxg1036xxx  receptors, highest efficacies
(⬃70%) were seen for quinerolane, quinpirole, and tl99, whereas
piribedil and terguride behaved as antagonists and bromocriptine
was inactive. although efficacies at hd2s versus hd2l sites were
highly correlated (r ⫽ 0.79), they correlated only modestly to
hd3/ xxxg1036xxx  sites (r ⫽ 0.44 – 0.59). in [35s]gtp␥s studies of h␣2a-ars,
tl99 (108%), pramipexole (52%), talipexole (51%), pergolide
(31%), apomorphine (16%), and quinerolane (11%) were agonists
and  xxxd3145xxx  and roxindole were inactive, whereas piribedil and
other agents were antagonists. similar findings were obtained at
h␣2b- and h␣2c-ars. using [3h]phosphatidylinositol depletion,
roxindole, bromocriptine,  xxxd2498xxx , and terguride displayed potent
antagonist properties at h␣1a-ars. in conclusion, antiparkinson
agents display diverse agonist and antagonist properties at multiple subtypes of d2-like receptor and ␣1/␣2-ar, actions, which
likely contribute to their contrasting functional profiles.

release, whereas postsynaptic d2s and d2l receptors in the
basal ganglia, via contrasting patterns of interaction with d1
sites, differentially influence motor function; notably, blockade of d2l sites underlies the extrapyramidal motor effects of
dopaminergic antagonists (wang et al., 2000). as shown in
the accompanying article (millan et al., 2002), therapeutically used antiparkinson agents recognize d2s and d2l isoforms with similar affinity, and many antiparkinson agents
also interact with dopamine d3 receptors. although the density of striatal d3 receptors is reduced upon degeneration of
nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways, exposure to l-dopa
may induce their up-regulation, reflecting complex regulatory mechanisms involving dopamine d1 receptors and brainderived  xxxg1614xxx  (quik et al., 2000; guillin et al.,
2001; joyce, 2001). nevertheless, the precise nature of functional interrelationships among d3, d2, and d1 receptors,

(arnsten, 1997). the perturbation of cardiovascular function
associated with pronounced activation or blockade of ␣1-ars
should also be accentuated (guimarães and moura, 2001).
the above-mentioned observations exemplify the importance of characterizing functional actions of antiparkinson
agents at subtypes of “hd2-like” receptor and h␣1/2-ar. however, studies have been restricted to a few ligands at poorly
characterized native sites compared with defined classes of
(cloned) human receptor (see discussion). knowledge of the
comparative agonist/antagonist profiles of antiparkinson
agents remains, thus, fragmentary. the present study expanded, therefore, the multivariate analyses of binding profiles presented in the preceding article (millan et al., 2002) in
evaluating efficacies of diverse antiparkinson agents at
cloned hd2s, hd2l, hd3, and  xxxg1036xxx  dopamine receptors, and at
h␣2a-, h␣2b- h␣2c-, and h␣1a-ars, stably expressed in a
common cellular system, chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells.

materials and methods
determination of drug efficacies at hd2-like receptors
and at h␣2-ar subtypes by [35s]gtp␥s binding. efficacies at
cho-expressed recombinant hd2s, hd2l, hd3, and  xxxg1036xxx  ( xxxg1036xxx .4 isoform) receptors, and at cho-expressed h␣2a-, h␣2b-, and h␣2c-ars
were determined by measuring the influence of drugs alone and,
where appropriate, in interaction with da or na upon [35s]gtp␥s
binding. the protocols used have been described in detail previously
(newman-tancredi et al., 1997, 1999a,b; millan et al., 2001). briefly,
the concentration of [35s]gtp␥s was 0.1 nm (hd2s, hd2l, and  xxxg1036xxx ),
0.2 nm (h␣2a-ar, h␣2b-ar, and h␣2c-ar) or 1.0 nm (hd3). the ph
was 7.4 in each case and the temperature 22°c. incubation time was
40 min for hd2s, hd2l, and hd3 sites, 20 min for  xxxg1036xxx  sites, and 60
min for h␣2-ar subtypes. the buffer contained 20 mm hepes, 100
or 150 mm nacl, 3 ␮m gdp, and 3 or 10 mm mgcl2. membranes
were incubated with the antiparkinson agent alone and/or with da
(3 ␮m-hd2s, 10 ␮m-hd2l, and 1 ␮m- xxxg1036xxx ) or na (10 ␮m for each
subtype) for 15 min before the addition of [35s]gtp␥s. agonist efficacies were expressed as a percentage of the effect observed with
maximally effective concentrations of da (10 ␮m) or na (10 ␮m).
experiments were terminated by rapid filtration through gf/b filters (whatman, maidstone, uk) using a 96-well cell harvester (packard instrument company, inc., downers grove, il), and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting.
determination of drug efficacies at h␣1a-ars by [3h]phosphatidylinositol ([3h]pi) depletion. the efficacies of drugs alone,
and in interaction with na, were determined in cho-expressed
h␣1a-ars as described previously (millan et al., 2001). briefly, cells
were labeled with 2 ␮ci/ml of [3h] xxxd2360xxx  (10 –20 ci/mmol) for
24 h. cells were washed and then incubated at 37°c for 30 min with
the drug alone in krebs-licl buffer: 15.6 mm nah2po4 ph 7, 120
mm nacl, 4.8 mm kcl, 1.2 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 1.2 mm cacl2, 0.6% (w/v)
glucose, 0.04% (w/v) bovine  xxxg124xxx , and 10 mm licl. in the
absence of na, ⬃40,000 dpm was typically detected, compared with
⬃25,000 in the presence of a maximally effective concentration of na
(30 ␮m). drug efficacies were expressed as a percentage of the effect
observed with a maximally effective concentration of na (30 ␮m).
for antagonist studies, cells were preincubated for 15 min with drug
before the addition of na (10 ␮m) and incubation continued for 30
min. membranes were recovered by rapid filtration through gf/b
filters (whatman) using a 96-well cell harvester (packard instrument company, inc.), and the [3h]pi content was determined by
scintillation counting (millan et al., 2001).

pared with dyskinetic effects of antiparkinson agents, remain
to be clarified (joyce, 2001). the majority of antiparkinson
agents also show significant affinity for d4 receptors (millan
et al., 2002), but their engagement does not improve motor
function; furthermore, antagonist properties at d4 receptors
may minimize psychiatric side effects and improve cognitive
function (newman-tancredi et al., 1997; arnsten et al.,
2000).
several antiparkinson drugs display pronounced affinities
for h␣2a-, h␣2b-, and h␣2c-ars (millan et al., 2002). this is of
note in light of the importance of adrenergic mechanisms in
the etiology and treatment of parkinson’s disease (brefelcourbon et al., 1998; bezard et al., 2001). in addition to their
postsynaptic localization, ␣2a-ars are expressed as inhibitory autoreceptors on adrenergic neurons (nicholas et al.,
1997; millan et al., 2000a,b). furthermore, ␣2a-ars exert an
inhibitory influence upon ascending serotonergic pathways,
frontocortical and subcortical dopaminergic pathways (kable
et al., 2000; millan et al., 2000a,b) as well as corticolimbic
cholinergic and glutamatergic pathways (horn et al., 1982;
tellez et al., 1997; boehm, 1999). correspondingly, ␣2a-ars
fulfill an important role in the control of motor function,
mood, and cognition (arnsten, 1997; kable et al., 2000; millan et al., 2000b). furthermore, ␣2b-ars are enriched in the
thalamus, a structure interlinked with the basal ganglia and
involved in the disruption of motor function in parkinson’s
disease, whereas ␣2c-ars are concentrated in the striatum
itself (nicholas et al., 1997; bezard et al., 2001). gene knockout studies have indicated a modulatory influence of central
␣2c-ars, complementary to ␣2a-ars, upon motor and cognitive function (kable et al., 1999; bjorklund et al., 2000).
although the precise significance of individual ␣2-ar subtypes remains unclear, there is evidence that ␣2-ar antagonist properties may be useful in the management of parkinson’s disease. first, in rats sustaining unilateral
6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the substantia nigra pars compacta (snpc), ␣2-ar agonists and antagonists, respectively,
inhibit and enhance amphetamine-induced rotation (mavridis et al., 1991). second, in primates displaying parkinson’s
disease-like symptoms after treatment with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, ␣2-ar antagonists increase
locomotor activity and reduce dyskinesias induced by
l-dopa (brefel-courbon et al., 1998; bezard et al., 2001).
third, after enhancement of adrenergic transmission by
blockade of ␣2a-ar autoreceptors, noradrenaline (na) may
(independently of ␣2-ars) exert neuroprotective actions at
dopaminergic neurons in the snpc (troadec et al., 2001).
fourth, small-scale clinical studies indicate that the ␣2-ar
antagonist idazoxan improves motor performance in parkinson’s disease patients receiving l-dopa (brefel-courbon et
al., 1998).
several antiparkinson agents also interact with h␣1a-,
h␣1b-, and h␣1d-ars (millan et al., 2002). although the relevance of ␣1-ars to management of parkinson’s disease is
less apparent than for their ␣2-ar counterparts, they modulate ascending serotoninergic and dopaminergic transmission and play an important role in motor control (millan et
al., 2000a; spreng et al., 2001; stone et al., 2001). indeed,
␣1-ar antagonists interfere with the induction of rotation by
antiparkinson agents in rats sustaining unilateral lesions of
the snpc (mavridis et al., 1991). furthermore, frontocortical
␣1-ars are implicated in the control of cognitive function

determined in competition binding experiments (data not
shown; millan et al., 2002).
drug actions at hd2l receptors. at hd2l receptors
(bmax ⫽ 2.2 pmol/mg), at a maximally effective concentration
(10 ␮m), da enhanced [35s]gtp␥s binding by ⬃1.9-fold; it
displayed a pec50 value of 6.5 (fig. 1; table 1). at hd2l
receptors, efficacies for all ligands were markedly lower than
at hd2s sites. indeed, all ligands, except quinelorane, behaved as partial agonists. roxindole and terguride induced
no stimulation of [35s]gtp␥s binding and displayed antagonist properties. the correlation coefficient for efficacies at
hd2l versus hd2s receptors was 0.79 (p ⬍ 0.05). drug potencies for stimulation of [35s]gtp␥s binding (pec50 values) at
hd2l receptors correlated well (r ⫽ 0.93, p ⬍ 0.05) with their
pki values determined in competition binding experiments
(data not shown; millan et al., 2002).
drug actions at hd3 receptors. at hd3 receptors (bmax
⫽ 15.6 pmol/mg), at a maximally effective concentration (10
␮m), da enhanced [35s]gtp␥s binding by ⬃1.6-fold; it displayed a pec50 value of 7.8 (fig. 1; table 1). all drugs
behaved as agonists at hd3 receptors, with efficacies varying
from 30% (roxindole) and 34% (piribedil) to 88% (talipexole)
and 94% (tl99). the lower efficacies of quinelorane and
quinpirole at hd3 versus hd2s and hd2l sites are of note,
whereas roxindole and bromocriptine showed higher efficacies at hd3 than hd2s and hd2l sites. indeed, there was no
consistent pattern of drug efficacies at hd3 relative to hd2s
and hd2l receptors. accordingly, correlation coefficients for
efficacies at hd3 compared with hd2l and hd2s sites, although significant (p ⬍ 0.05), were only 0.59 and 0.49, respectively. drug potencies for stimulation of [35s]gtp␥s
binding (pec50 values) at hd3 receptors correlated significantly (r ⫽ 0.62, p ⬍ 0.05) with pki values determined in
competition binding experiments (data not shown; millan et
al., 2002).
drug actions at  xxxg1036xxx  receptors. at  xxxg1036xxx  receptors (bmax
⫽ 1.4 pmol/mg), at a maximally effective concentration (10

␮m), da enhanced [35s]gtp␥s binding by ⬃2.2-fold; it displayed a pec50 value of 7.0 (table 1). although bromocriptine did not interact with  xxxg1036xxx  receptors, agonist efficacies of
the other drugs varied widely. thus, although tl99, quinelorane, and quinpirole showed relatively high efficacies
(⬃70%), pergolide, talipexole, cabergoline, apomorphine, roxindole, pramipexole, and  xxxd2498xxx  showed less marked efficacies of 32 to 56%. piribedil displayed very low efficacy (7%)
and antagonized the stimulation by da of [35s]gtp␥s binding. terguride, which was inactive alone, similarly blocked
the action of da. on the other hand, roxindole was more
efficacious at  xxxg1036xxx  than at hd2s and hd2l receptors. thus,
there was no consistent pattern of drug efficacies at  xxxg1036xxx 
versus hd2s, hd2l, and hd3 receptors and correlation coefficients, although significant (p ⬍ 0.05), were modest: hd2s,
r ⫽ 0.57; hd2l, r ⫽ 0.55; and hd3, r ⫽ 0.44. drug potencies for
stimulation of [35s]gtp␥s binding (pec50 values) at  xxxg1036xxx 
receptors correlated well (r ⫽ 0.78, p ⬍ 0.05) with their pki
values determined in competition binding experiments (data
not shown; millan et al., 2002).
drug actions at h␣2a-, h␣2b-, and h␣2c-ars. at h␣2a-,
h␣2b-, and h␣2c-ars, a maximally effective concentration of
na (10 ␮m) increased [35s]gtp␥s binding by 7.2-, 6.6-, and
2.7-fold, respectively; pec50 values were 6.2, 6.5, and 6.5,
respectively (figs. 2, 3 and 4; table 2). antiparkinson agents
differed markedly concerning their functional activities at
h␣2a-, h␣2b-, and h␣2c-ars. tl99 behaved as a high-efficacy
agonist at each subtype of h␣2-ar, whereas talipexole behaved as a partial agonist at each subtype. on the other
hand, pergolide showed pronounced efficacy at h␣2b-ars,
intermediate efficacy at h␣2a-ars, and low efficacy at h␣2cars. pramipexole revealed partial agonist properties at
h␣2a-ars; actions were not evaluated at h␣2b- and h␣2c-ars
owing to its low affinities at these sites (millan et al., 2002).
apomorphine showed low efficacy only at h␣2a-ars, whereas
high concentrations of quinelorane and quinpirole revealed
weak partial agonist actions at h␣2a- and h␣2b-ars, respectively. agonist pec50 values for stimulation of [35s]gtp␥s

as described in table 1. [35s]gtp␥s binding is expressed as a percentage of that observed with a maximally effective concentration (10 ␮m) of
noradrenaline (defined as 100%). values shown are from representative experiments performed in triplicate and repeated on at least three occasions.

binding corresponded well to their respective pki values as
defined in competition binding assays (millan et al., 2002). in
view of its high affinity and low efficacy at h␣2a-ar subtypes,
apomorphine was further evaluated in interaction with na and
shown to behave as an antagonist. furthermore, several other
drugs also reversed na-stimulated [35s]gtp␥s binding. for
drugs behaving as antagonists, pkb values correlated well (p ⬍
0.05) with their respective pki values derived from competition
binding studies (data not shown; millan et al., 2002): h␣2a-ars,

drug actions at h␣1a-ars. ligands that exhibited
significant binding affinity at h␣1a-ars (pki values ⱖ6.0;
millan et al., 2002) were evaluated in a functional test of
phospholipase c activation, depletion of membrane-bound
[3h]pi (fig. 5; table 3). in this procedure, na itself revealed a pec50 value of 6.51. no compound stimulated

phospholipase c activity when tested alone, indicating an
absence of agonist properties. in contrast, in order of decreasing potency, roxindole, bromocriptine,  xxxd2498xxx , terguride, cabergoline, and piribedil all reversed the stimulation of [3h]pi hydrolysis induced by noradrenaline (10
␮m), demonstrating antagonist properties. pkb values at
h␣1a-ars correlated well (r ⫽ 0.96, p ⬍ 0.05) with pki
values obtained from competition binding assays (data not
shown; millan et al., 2002).

d2s and d2l receptors. in the only previous comparison
of antiparkinson agonists at hd2s versus hd2l receptors
( xxxd3145xxx , talipexole, pergolide,  xxxd2498xxx , and bromocriptine), no marked differences in efficacy were apparent (gardner et al., 1997; gardner and strange, 1998). in the present,
more extensive work, however, drug efficacies were invariably higher at hd2s sites. the reasons underlying this difference require elucidation, but it may be of pertinence that
hd2s and hd2l receptors differentially interact with distinct
subtypes of g protein, as implicated in their contrasting
patterns of coupling to calcium channels (wolfe and morris,
1999). furthermore, the expression level (2.2 pmol/mg) of
hd2l sites herein was higher than that of hd2s sites (1.4
pmol/mg), whereas the inverse was true for gardner et al.

(1997) (1.3 versus 2.7 pmol/mg, respectively). in the light of
these comments, it should briefly be pointed out that receptor
density can play an important role in determining drug efficacy (newman-tancredi et al., 2001). although receptor density (bmax) can easily be determined at pure populations of
transfected receptors (see results), equivalent information
for defined networks of neurons is not available because bmax
estimations in native tissue almost inevitably incorporate
neurons not expressing the receptor in question. thus, although the receptor densities of hd2s and hd2l sites here
were in the same range as previous studies (coldwall et al.,
1999; perachon et al., 1999), they cannot be compared with
certainty to cerebral populations. furthermore, it is important to note differences in density between pre- versus
postsynaptic populations of d2 (and d3) receptors (seyfried
and boettcher, 1990), as well as the up-regulation of postsyn-

aptic sites after damage to dopaminergic innervation (kostrzewa, 1995; newman-tancredi et al., 2001), an experimental
manipulation that mimics the pathology of parkinson’s disease (see below).
although the relative degree of d2s versus d2l receptor
stimulation required for optimal control of parkinson’s disease remains to be clarified, quinelorane was the only drug to
exhibit efficacy equivalent to dopamine at both hd2s and
hd2l receptors, in line with its high efficacy at native, rat d2
receptors (sánchez and arnt, 1992; newman-tancredi et al.,
2001). the relatively high efficacies of quinpirole,  xxxd3145xxx ,
pramipexole, and talipexole at hd2s (terasmaa et al., 2000)
and hd2l sites for stimulation of [35s]gtp␥s binding coincide with measures of extracellular acidification and mitogenesis (mierau et al., 1995; coldwall et al., 1999; perachon
et al., 1999; alberts et al., 2000; gilliland and alper, 2000).
the present [35s]gtp␥s approach likewise revealed high
efficacies at hd2s and hd2l sites of cabergoline and tl99
(hughes, 1997). like bromocriptine and  xxxd2498xxx , piribedil

displayed intermediate efficacy. this is interesting because
piribedil is highly active in rodent and primate models of
antiparkinson activity; furthermore, piribedil improves motor and cognitive function in patients both alone and in
association with l-dopa (rondot and ziegler, 1992; maurin
et al., 2001; nagaraja and jayashree, 2001). interestingly,
terguride failed to activate hd2l receptors, in line with its
low efficacy in rodent models of hypothermia, locomotion,
and drug discrimination (arnt and hyttel, 1990; sánchez and
arnt, 1992). although terguride showed weak partial agonist
activity in hd2l receptor-expressing sh-sy5y cells, its efficacy was much lower than that of quinpirole (gilliland and
alper, 2000). furthermore, although terguride showed modest antiparkinson activity and attenuated l-dopa-induced
dyskinesia in primates, it was effective in only a small percentage (10 –20%) of parkinson’s disease patients in (subsequently discontinued) clinical trials (filipova et al., 1988;
akai et al., 1993). furthermore, roxindole, which likewise
exhibited low efficacy at hd2l and hd2s receptors (newmantancredi et al., 1999a), failed to reduce l-dopa-induced
dyskinesias in parkinson’s disease patients and has not, as
yet, been shown to possess antiparkinson activity in human.
correspondingly, a certain, minimal “threshold” of efficacy
may be necessary for antiparkinson properties. however,
“full” agonism at the level of g protein-coupling ([35s]gtp␥s
binding) is not essential for robust clinical activity in parkinson’s disease because 1) efficacy is “amplified” by intracellular cascades downstream of g proteins (cussac et al., 2002);
2) postsynaptic striatal d2 receptors (probably the d2l isoform) are hypersensitive due to loss of dopaminergic input
from the snpc (kostrzewa, 1995; geurts et al., 1999; newman-tancredi et al., 2001); and 3) submaximal efficacy is
sufficient to activate highly sensitive d2s autoreceptors implicated in neuroprotective properties of dopaminergic agonists (seyfried and boettcher, 1990). moreover, antiparkinson agents of intermediate efficacy may preferentially engage
nigrostriatal d2 receptors implicated in the treatment of

tential significance of this (low-potency) action in vivo, however, remains to be clarified. on the other hand, in vivo
studies in rodents have revealed agonist actions of pergolide
at central ␣2-ars (langtry and clissold, 1990) and particularly pronounced agonist properties at h␣2b-ars were observed here.
these contrasting actions of antiparkinson agents are of
considerable significance in light of evidence that blockade of
␣2-ars improves motor performance, cognitive function, and
perhaps mood in parkinson’s disease (brefel-courbon et al.,
1998). indeed, experimental and clinical studies with piribedil support the notion that “built-in” ␣2-ar antagonist actions may be beneficial in parkinson’s disease (maurin et al.,
2001; millan et al., 2001; nagaraja and jayashree, 2001). in
contrast, ␣2-ar agonists interfere with the facilitory influence of antiparkinson agents upon motor function (mavridis
et al., 1991; bezard et al., 2001). indeed, talipexole-induced
stereotypy in rats (which reflects agonist properties at striatal d2 receptors) is only apparent upon prevention of its
␣2-ar agonist properties by coadministration of idazoxan
(meltzer et al., 1989). similarly, tl99-induced hypomotility
has been attributed to its ␣2-ar agonist properties (horn et
al., 1982), whereas it only elicits rotation in unilateral snpclesioned rats upon cotreatment with ␣2-ar antagonists (martin et al., 1983).
nevertheless, future studies should address the significance of ␣2-ar subtypes in the clinical actions of antiparkinson drugs. although ␣2a-ars are certainly of key importance
(kable et al., 2000; millan et al., 2000a), ␣2b- and ␣2c-ars
sites should not be neglected. the former are concentrated in
the thalamus, a structure intimately involved in the motor
deficits of parkinson’s disease, whereas ␣2c-ars are enriched
in the striatum itself (nicholas et al., 1997; bezard et al.,
2001). moreover, gene knockout studies indicate that ␣2cars contribute to the modulation of monoaminergic transmission, cognitive function, and motor performance (bjorklund et al., 2000; kable et al., 2000). although no
antiparkinson agent showed agonist versus antagonist actions at distinct ␣2-ar subtypes, the lack of antagonist actions of piribedil at ␣2b- versus ␣2a/2c-ars sites, and the
preferential agonist actions of pergolide at ␣2b- versus ␣2aand ␣2c-ars, may prove instructive in elucidating their relevance to parkinson’s disease and its treatment.
actions at h␣1a-ars. roxindole and the ergot derivatives
bromocriptine,  xxxd2498xxx , and terguride interact with cloned
h␣1-ars (millan et al., 2002), although, with the exception of
a study of bromocripine at peripheral ␣1-ars (mcpherson,
1984), no information on their functional activities is available. thus, their potent antagonism of na-induced [3h]pi
depletion at cloned h␣1a-ars is of note, whereas cabergoline
and piribedil showed weak antagonist properties in line with
their low affinities at these sites (millan et al., 2002). potent
blockade of h␣1-ars may be unfavorable inasmuch as ␣1-ar
antagonists interfere with antiparkinson properties in experimental models (mavridis et al., 1991). although blockade of
␣1-ars in the cortex and on pars reticulata gabaergic neurons may be involved, generalized sedative/motor-suppressive effects due to blockade of ␣1a-ars in motor nuclei of the
brainstem and the spinal cord may also be of significance
(stone et al., 2001). blockade of segmental and peripheral
␣1a-ars may also be deleterious in that it exacerbates the
perturbation of cardiovascular function elicited via stimula-

parkinson’s disease compared with other populations mediating side effects. thus, “submaximal” efficacy at the g protein level for drugs such as piribedil or bromocriptine may be
advantageous in optimizing the therapeutic index between
clinical efficacy and side effects.
hd3 receptors. although hd3 receptors couple less efficiently to g proteins in cho cells than their hd2s/hd2l
counterparts, da stimulated [35s]gtp␥s binding in the
high-expressing cell line used herein (newman-tancredi et
al., 1999b). the substantial affinities of apomorphine, quinpirole, pramipexole, talipexole, bromocriptine, and pergolide
corroborate studies of their actions in models of microphysiometry and mitogenesis (mierau et al., 1995; coldwell et al.,
1999; perachon et al., 1999). the high efficacy of tl99 at hd3
receptors is of note in view of its marked efficacy at hd2s/
hd2l and  xxxg1036xxx  sites, whereas the modest efficacies of terguride and roxindole at hd3 sites mimic their low efficacies at
hd2l and (terguride)  xxxg1036xxx  sites. as concerns piribedil, its
intermediate efficacy at hd3 receptors resembles its actions
at hd2s/hd2l receptors and is consistent with agonist properties in vivo at d3 autoreceptors (millan et al., 1995). as
discussed elsewhere (joyce, 2001), the role of d3 sites in the
expression of beneficial and deleterious actions of antiparkinson agents remains unclear, a question of particular importance because, as shown herein, all antiparkinson agents
activated d3 receptors.
 xxxg1036xxx  receptors. in line with studies of cho cells expressing the  xxxg1036xxx .2 isoform (gilliland and alper, 2000) and of
cloned, rat d4 sites (gazi et al., 2000), quinpirole showed
substantial efficacy at  xxxg1036xxx  ( xxxg1036xxx .4) receptors. this characteristic was shared by quinerolane and tl99. the agonist properties of pergolide, apomorphine, talipexole, and pramipexole
at  xxxg1036xxx  sites complement work using other measures of drug
efficacy and/or other  xxxg1036xxx  isoforms (mieurau et al., 1995;
coldwell et al., 1999; gazi et al., 2000; gilliland and alper,
2000). like pergolide, two other ergolines, cabergoline and
 xxxd2498xxx , similarly showed agonist properties at  xxxg1036xxx  sites. in
contrast, piribedil displayed low efficacy at  xxxg1036xxx  receptors,
whereas bromocriptine was inactive. because bromocriptine
and piribedil are clinically efficacious antiparkinson agents,
these data support the argument that activation of d4 receptors is not necessary for therapeutic efficacy (newman-tancredi et al., 1997). moreover, the essentially d4 antagonist
properties of piribedil may limit psychiatric side effects and
contribute to its improvement of cognitive function (arnsten
et al., 2000; nagaraja and jayashree, 2001).
h␣2-ars. striking differences in drug efficacies were seen
at h␣2-ar subtypes. in analogy to piribedil (millan et al.,
2001),  xxxd2498xxx , bromocriptine, and apomorphine displayed
antagonist properties, observations amplifying functional
studies of isolated organs and hippocampal na release in
rats (mcpherson, 1984; jackisch et al., 1985). in line with
their high affinities for h␣2-ars (millan et al., 2002), roxindole and two further ergot-related ligands, terguride and
cabergoline, also manifested potent ␣2-ar antagonist properties. in contrast, in line with in vivo studies (at undefined
␣2-ar subtypes) in rodents (horn et al., 1982; meltzer et al.,
1989; sánchez and arnt, 1992), tl99 displayed agonist, and
talipexole partial agonist, properties at h␣2a-, h␣2b-, and
h␣2c-ars. extending observations of partial agonist properties at central ␣2-ars in rodents (ferrari et al., 1993),
pramipexole displayed modest efficacy at h␣2a-ars. any po-

tion of spinal dopaminergic receptors (guimarães and
moura, 2001). on the other hand, inasmuch as frontocortical
␣1-ars inhibit working memory, their blockade might improve cognitive function (arnsten, 1997), although there is
currently no clinical support for this possibility. further investigations should determine the potential importance for
antiparkinson agents of actions at h␣1b- and h␣1d-ar subtypes (millan et al., 2002), which likewise modulate motor,
cognitive, and cardiovascular function (guimarães and
moura, 2001; spreng et al., 2001; stone et al., 2001).

the present data reveal striking differences among antiparkinson agents concerning efficacies at multiple classes of
hd2-like receptor and  xxxd951xxx /ha2-ar. these observations amplify receptor-binding analyses of the accompanying article
(millan et al., 2002) in demonstrating that antiparkinson
drugs are heterogeneous rather than a common group of
“dopaminergic agonists”. in this light, as discussed above,
partial agonist and agonist properties at d2s/d2l receptors
are favorable in the management of motor symptoms of parkinson’s disease, whereas blockade of ␣2a-ars may improve
cognitive-attentional function and mood. the present data
provide a framework for additional studies of the significance
of these and other subtypes of dopaminergic receptor and
␣1/␣2-ar in the etiology of parkinson’s disease, and in the
beneficial and deleterious properties of antiparkinson
agents.
