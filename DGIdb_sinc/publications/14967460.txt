the  xxxg682xxx  (egfr) is a transmembrane glycoprotein, with an extracellular ligandbinding domain and intracellular  xxxg2198xxx  domain. ligand binding induces egfr dimerization and
autophosphorylation on several tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain, leading to mitogenic signal
transduction. egfr overexpression correlates with a poor prognosis and is often associated with malignant
transformation in a variety of epithelial cancers.  xxxd2838xxx  is a high-affinity (dissociation constant kd ⴝ 5 ⴛ
10ⴚ11 m) fully human igg2 monoclonal antibody against human egfr.  xxxd2838xxx  binds egfr and blocks
receptor binding of egf and transforming growth factor-␣, inhibiting egfr tyrosine phosphorylation and
tumor cell activation.  xxxd2838xxx  prevents tumor formation and eradicates large, established a431 tumors in
xenograft models. tumor growth inhibition occurs at relatively low doses, without concomitant chemotherapy or
radiotherapy. when combined with chemotherapeutic agents,  xxxd2838xxx  has resulted in additive antitumor
activity. a phase i clinical trial has demonstrated activity in several tumor types, and the results from a phase
ii trial for renal cell cancer also showed modest activity. therapy was generally well tolerated without
statistically significant adverse events. monoclonal antibody blockade of egfr represents a new and exciting
direction in cancer therapy. © 2004 elsevier inc.

introduction

intracellular molecules, with subsequent signaling of a variety of cellular events (2, 3). the ras-raf-mitogen–activated
protein kinase pathway (4) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the downstream protein kinase akt that regulates
apoptosis, gene expression, and cell proliferation (5–7) are
the two major pathways involved in tumorigenesis. egfr
overexpression correlates with a poor prognosis and may be
associated with malignant transformation in a variety of
epidermal cancers (8, 9). concomitant with egfr overexpression, the expression of one of the receptor ligands,
usually tgf-␣, is also typically upregulated (10 –12).
blockade of the tgf-␣/egfr autocrine pathway is a proposed therapeutic modality (8, 9, 13).
 xxxd2838xxx  is a high-affinity (dissociation constant [kd]

the  xxxg682xxx  (egfr) is a member
of the  xxxg682xxx  family of four related cell membrane receptors,
including egfr ( xxxg682xxx  or  xxxg682xxx ), erbb2 (her2),  xxxg722xxx 
( xxxg722xxx ), and  xxxg723xxx  ( xxxg723xxx ). these are transmembrane glycoprotein receptors, each of which has an extracellular ligandbinding domain. the intracellular domain has  xxxg2198xxx  activity for signal transduction. a number of ligands,
including  xxxg681xxx  (egf), transforming
growth factor-␣ (tgf-␣), and  xxxg185xxx , bind to the
extracellular domain of egfr. after ligand binding, the
receptor dimerizes with another egfr monomer (homodimerization) or another member of the  xxxg682xxx  family
(heterodimerization) (1). this leads to egfr tyrosine autophosphorylation, followed by phosphorylation of several

(mab) against human egfr. in this report, we discuss the
development of  xxxd2838xxx  using xenomouse威 technology
and present the preclinical and clinical data.
xenomouse technology to generate
fully human monoclonal antibodies
hybridoma technology, introduced by kohler and milstein (14) ⬎25 years ago, suggested the potential of mabs
for human therapy. the first-generation mabs were murine
derived and immunogenic in humans, leading to human
anti-mouse antibody responses. to overcome this problem,
efforts were made to engineer part-human, part-mouse chimeric mabs and “humanized” mabs (fig. 1). chimeric
mabs are generated by genetically combining the antigenbinding regions (fv) of the mouse antibody with  xxxd2207xxx 
constant domains. the resulting chimeric antibody consists
of 34% mouse protein (15). humanized mabs are constructed by “implanting” the complementary domain regions of the mouse antibody into the  xxxd2207xxx  framework.
the humanized antibody still contains ⬃5–10% mouse protein sequences (16). chimeric and humanized mabs have
improved therapeutic utility and markedly reduced immunogenicity compared with murine mabs but may still be
immunogenic and allergenic in a fraction of patients (17,
18). the goal of establishing a fully human mab was
accomplished by the development of the xenomouse威
mice, in which human immunoglobulin genes were introduced into mice genetically engineered to lack functional
mouse immunoglobulin expression (19 –23).
 xxxd2838xxx , a fully human monoclonal
antibody to egfr
tgf-␣ and egf regulate cell proliferation and differentiation through binding to the egfr. elevated levels of
egfr expression are found on many malignancies, including most squamous cell carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, and
gliomas (10 –12). overexpression may be a consequence of

gene amplification, as in the case of many gliomas, or, more
commonly, of increased gene transcription (11). it was
proposed that egfr overexpression plays a role in the
tumorigenesis of cancer cells (24). invasiveness and poor
differentiation correlate with the high number of egfrs in
some tumors (25). moreover, several tumors have shown an
association of increased egfr expression with detectable
levels of its ligand, tgf-␣ (26).
blocking mabs to the human egfr have been generated
in rodents (8, 9, 13, 27) and characterized in murine xenografts (8, 9, 13). some mabs caused tumor growth inhibition and eradication when combined with concomitant chemotherapy (13, 28). the chimeric version of the mouse
anti-egfr mab ( xxxd467xxx ) demonstrated improved binding
affinity and in vivo antitumor activity at high doses (29),
establishing a rationale for antibody therapy targeting
egfr. however,  xxxd467xxx  is a mouse-human chimeric antibody and appears to be immunogenic in about 5% of patients (17, 18). we generated a panel of fully human igg2
mabs against egfr using the xenomouse威 technology
(fig. 2) (30, 31). these anti-egfr mabs demonstrated
high binding affinity to egfr (kd ⫽ 10⫺9 to ⬃10⫺10 m)
(30). in vitro,  xxxd2838xxx , formerly known as clone  xxxd2838xxx 
(30), bound egfr with an affinity of 5 ⫻ 10⫺11 m, blocked
binding of egf and tgf-␣ to the receptor, and inhibited
egf-activated egfr tyrosine phosphorylation and tumor
cell activation. this resulted in inhibition of in vitro tumor
cell proliferation.
treatment with  xxxd2838xxx  prevented and eradicated
a431 tumors in xenografts, without concomitant chemotherapy or radiotherapy (30). the antitumor effect of abxegf was also seen in multiple human solid tumors derived
from different tissues and displaying different egfr expression levels in xenograft models (fig. 3) (32).
egfr expression on the cell surface was quantitated
using flow cytometric analysis of immunofluorescently
stained cells. the egfr number was determined by analytical flow cytometry in conjunction with fluorescent rphycoerythrin-bound microbead standards (33). egfr ex-

pression levels on human breast, epidermal, renal,
pancreatic, prostate, ovary, and colon carcinoma cell lines
ranged from 0 to 1.6 million copies/cell (fig. 3). tumor
cells (5 ⫻ 106 cells/mouse) from kidney (sk-rc-29), pancreas (bxpc-3, hs766t, and hpac), prostate ( xxxg1682xxx ), ovary
(igrovi), or colon (ht-29 and sw707) tissues were inoculated subcutaneously into nude mice. mice bearing established tumors were treated with 1 mg  xxxd2838xxx  twice
weekly for 3 weeks.  xxxd2838xxx  treatment led to significant
growth inhibition of multiple tumor xenografts, including
sk-rc-29, bxpc-3, igrovi,  xxxg1682xxx , hs766t, and ht-29
(32). these data supported the concept that egfr expression may be accompanied by tumor growth dependency on
the egfr pathway and that blockade of the egfr pathway
with egfr blocking antibodies, such as  xxxd2838xxx , can
lead to tumor growth arrest and eradication. these data also
indicated that  xxxd2838xxx  could inhibit the growth of, not
only the tumors that express extremely high egfr levels,
such as a431 and mda-mb-468, but also other human
carcinomas that express lower egfr levels (fig. 3). moreover,  xxxd2838xxx  therapy in combination with chemotherapeutic agents resulted in additive antitumor activity in the
a431 tumor model (fig. 4) (34). recent preclinical and
clinical data have suggested that egfr expression levels
alone may not be an adequate predictor of response to
egfr-inhibitory therapy. therefore, it is critical to understand the mechanism of action of egfr inhibitors as a
cancer therapy.
the mechanism of in vivo  xxxd2838xxx  antitumor activity
may involve the downregulation of egfr expression by
triggering receptor internalization, induction of apoptosis
triggered by blocking egfr signaling pathways and induction of cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of angiogenesis (30,
32, 34 –36). because  xxxd2838xxx  is a human igg2 antibody
that essentially lacks effector functions, complement- xxxd2870xxx -

dent and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicities
likely do not account for the in vivo antitumor activity.

clinical trials
a phase i, multicenter, open-label, multiple-dose, doseescalating clinical trial was initiated for patients with renal,
prostate, pancreatic, non–small-cell lung, colorectal, or gastroesophageal cancer. patients received four intravenous
 xxxd2838xxx  infusions once weekly for ⱕ1 h, from 0.01 to 2.5
mg/kg (37).
the primary objective of this phase i study was to determine the tolerability of multidose  xxxd2838xxx  administration. the primary statistical objective was to determine the
maximal tolerated dose of  xxxd2838xxx . the study was designed so that when a single patient within a cohort experienced a dose-limiting toxicity, dosing of a higher dose
cohort would not be initiated until 2 additional patients had
been enrolled and dosed without exhibiting a dose-limiting
toxicity. if one or both of these patients exhibited the same
toxicity, the dose level below this dose would be considered
the maximal tolerated dose. the secondary objectives of the
study were pharmacokinetics of different dose levels of
 xxxd2838xxx , the dose–response relationship of different dose
levels of  xxxd2838xxx , and assessing the clinical effect of
different dose levels of  xxxd2838xxx .
immunohistochemical analysis was used to determine
egfr overexpression in fresh or archival paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. these tumor tissues had to overexpress
egfr to the level of 2⫹ or 3⫹ in ⱖ10% of evaluated tumor
cells. a central laboratory, impath, using an egfr immunohistochemistry kit developed by dako corporation, in
collaboration with abgenix, determined the levels of egfr
expression in patient tumor samples.

prostate cancer had a minor response lasting for 6 months at
the 0.75-mg/kg dose, with three or four lesions regressing
38 –76% and  xxxg1281xxx  levels decreasing by
60%; and 1 patient with colorectal cancer had stable disease for
4 months at the 1.5-mg/kg dose. one patient with colorectal
cancer had a partial response at the 2.5 mg/kg dose (table 1).
part one of a two-part phase ii monotherapy trial, consisting of eight weekly infusions of  xxxd2838xxx , was performed in patients with renal cell cancer in whom interleukin-2/interferon-␣ therapy had failed or who were unable to
receive it (38). stable or responding patients were eligible
for extended weekly treatment at the assigned dose for eight
additional months or until disease progression. in part 1, 88
patients received at least one dose of  xxxd2838xxx  at 1.0
mg/kg (22 patients), 1.5 mg/kg (22 patients), 2.0 mg/kg (23
patients), or 2.5 mg/kg (21 patients). egfr overexpression
was documented in 91% of patients. only 11% of patients
had received no prior biotherapy or chemotherapy. most
patients were heavily pretreated, having received one to two
(56%) or three or more (33%) prior regimens. three patients
had a partial response (one each from the 1.0-, 1.5-, and
2.5-mg/kg dose levels) and two had minor responses (one
each from the 1.0- and 2.5-mg/kg dose levels). fifty percent
of patients had stable disease at the end of the first 8-week
treatment period. similar to the phase i study, a transient
acneiform skin rash was the primary toxicity, observed in
70%, 91%, 95%, or 100% of patients treated with at least
three doses of  xxxd2838xxx  at the 1.0-, 1.5-, 2.0-, or 2.5-mg/kg
dose levels, respectively. asthenia, pain, abdominal pain,
back pain, constipation, cough, and dyspnea occurred in a

dose-independent fashion. importantly, no statistically significant allergic or infusion-related reactions were observed,
and no haha responses have been detected. the absence
of a haha response is consistent with the extremely low
intrapatient variability of  xxxd2838xxx  exposure. pharmacokinetics demonstrated that egfr-mediated clearance of
 xxxd2838xxx  was saturated at a dose of 2 mg/kg. a 100% skin
rash incidence was achieved with increasing doses to 2.5
mg/kg, suggesting full receptor occupancy at this dose level.
serum  xxxd2838xxx  concentrations at the dose of 2.5 mg/kg
were similar to serum  xxxd2838xxx  concentrations that resulted in ⬎90% inhibition of a431 tumor growth in xenograft mice. acneform rash is considered an indirect marker
of clinically relevant egfr targeting and saturation in vivo.
in this respect, recent studies have suggested that the presence and intensity of acneform rash that resulted from
treatment with egfr inhibitors may predict increased survival in patients with different malignancies (39, 40).

conclusion
the autocrine-driven egfr pathway is a rational target
for cancer therapy. the blockade of egfr signaling in
cancer cells by  xxxd2838xxx  determines not only inhibition of
egfr  xxxg2198xxx  and cell proliferation, but also other
effects that are critical for tumor survival, growth, and
metastasis. these include antiangiogenesis effects by inhibition of tumor cell production of angiogenic growth factors
( xxxg2413xxx  and  xxxg562xxx ), and

anti-invasive and antimetastatic effects by inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase production (35, 36).
as a potent inhibitor of the egfr signaling pathway,
 xxxd2838xxx  has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity and encouraging results in clinical trials.
 xxxd2838xxx  has been well tolerated and has shown an
excellent safety profile with very mild and reversible side
effects. as a fully human monoclonal antibody, abx-

egf has shown no detectable haha responses in patients who received varying doses of  xxxd2838xxx . the
pharmacokinetic variability between and within patients
has been very low, allowing consistent exposure to the
drug. the results from phase i and ii trials (table 1) have
demonstrated that  xxxd2838xxx  has acceptable tolerability
and encouraging clinical activity in patients with a variety of tumor types.
