(putative 5-ht2b) in rat stomach fundus longitudinal muscle

1 the present study was undertaken to isolate and characterize pharmacologically homogeneous
populations of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) receptors from a possible mixed receptor population
mediating contraction of the longitudinal muscle of rat stomach fundus. our aim was to extend the
pharmacological characterization of the  xxxg1114xxx  which is reported to be expressed in this
preparation.
2 to minimize spontaneous activity and any influence of circular muscle on the contractile response,
narrow (-l1.5 x 20 mm) segments of mucosa-denuded longitudinal muscle were used. under these
conditions, blockade of monoamine oxidase with  xxxd2850xxx  (1001m for 15 min) caused a leftward
displacement of concentration-effect curves for both 5-methoxytryptamine (5-meo-t) and tryptamine.
neither  xxxd2850xxx  nor a number of uptake inhibitors affected responses to 5-ht.
3 in  xxxd2850xxx  pretreated preparations, the order of potency of a number of tryptamine analogues was
as follows: 5-meo-t > a-me-5-ht >1 5-ht> 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-ct)> tryptamine>  xxxd26xxx -5ht. in addition several ligands known to act as agonists at either 5-ht2a or 5-ht2c receptors including
1-m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-cpp), ru 24969, mk 212 and sch 23390 were also agonists in rat
fundus whilst sumatriptan,  xxxd3097xxx  and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-oh-dpat) were
very weak or inactive. with the exception of  xxxd26xxx -5-ht and m-cpp, most agonists produced
monophasic concentration-effect curves consistent with an interaction at a single site. high concentrations of  xxxd26xxx -5-ht evoked relaxations which were blocked by  xxxd2914xxx  (1 plm) suggesting an
interaction with a-adrenoceptors. m-cpp often evoked biphasic concentration-effect curves with a
second contractile phase which was insensitive to yohimbine at concentrations higher than required for
antagonism of responses to 5-ht.
4 ly 53857, methiothepin,  xxxd2621xxx , ritanserin and ici 170809 were potent but non-surmountable
antagonists of 5-ht in rat fundus. in contrast, several ligands behaved as surmountable antagonists with
the following order of potency: rauwolscine > yohimbine = mesulergine >  xxxd2637xxx  = sb 204070 >
wy 26703 > sb 200646> pirenpirone>  xxxd3097xxx . dau 6285, granisetron, spiperone,  xxxd2419xxx ,
 xxxd2914xxx  and gr 127935 did not affect responses to 5-ht at concentrations up to 1 pm. the
agonist and concentration independent profile of antagonism supported a single site interaction for both
agonists and antagonists.
5
we conclude that despite small differences concerning the enantiomeric selectivity and affinity of
rauwolscine and yohimbine, the close pharmacological identity of 5-ht receptors in rat stomach fundus
and the recently cloned  xxxg1114xxx  is maintained. sb 200646, which demonstrates some selectivity
for 5-ht receptors in rat stomach fundus, should provide a useful ligand for confirmation of this view
and allow discrimination of 5-ht2b function both in vitro and in vivo.

introduction
5-ht2 receptors have recently been sub-classified into
5-ht2a, 5-ht2b and  xxxg1115xxx  subtypes (humphrey et
al., 1993). the 5-ht2b mrna transcript has been identified
in rat stomach fundus (foguet et al., 1992a,b; kursar et al,
1992; wainscott et al., 1993) and in the small intestine,
kidney, heart and cerebellum of the mouse (loric et al.,
1992). although no functional correlate of the mouse 5-ht2b
receptor has yet been reported, it has been proposed that the
rat homologue equates with an 'orphan' receptor which
mediates a contractile response to 5-ht in stomach fundus
(foguet et al., 1992a,b; kursar et al., 1992; wainscott et al,
1993). the receptor in rat fundus has proved difficult to
classify using only pharmacological criteria and whilst some
groups have maintained that it represents a novel receptor
subtype (cohen & wittenauer, 1985; cohen & colbert, 1986;
cohen & fludzinski, 1987; blackburn et al., 1988; baez et
al., 1991), it has also been proposed that a variant of 5-htld
(kalkman & fozard, 1991), 5-ht2c (buchheit et al., 1986),
5-ht2a (gregg & osborne, 1985) or a mixture of receptors
(barlow & khan, 1959; winter & gessner, 1968; buchheit et

al., 1986) may mediate the contractile response to 5-ht
receptor agonists in this tissue. indeed, a multiple site
hypothesis may explain the occurrence of shallow (clineschmidt et al., 1985) or overtly biphasic (buchheit et al,1986)
agonist concentration-effect curves and the existence of pharmacological differences between the cloned  xxxg1114xxx 
and the putative  xxxg1114xxx  which is naturally expressed
in rat stomach (foguet et al., 1992b). comparisons of cloned
5-ht2b receptors and naturally expressed 5-ht receptors in
rat fundus may be further complicated by a failure to
account for uptake and metabolism. although agonist pec50
values determined in rat stomach fundus correlate well with
affinity values for cloned 5-ht2b receptors (wainscott et al.,
1993), the inclusion of agonists which are known to be
substrates for monoamine oxidase in rat stomach fundus may
cast doubt on the validity of the comparison. in this regard it
has been reported that unlike 5-ht or z-me-5-ht, the less
polar indoleamines including tryptamine and 5methoxytryptamine (5-meo-t) readily cross the cell membrane and are metabolized by monoamine oxidase resulting in
up to a 40 fold under-estimation of potency (vane, 1959).
questions remain as to whether the pharmacological

profile of the 5-ht receptor in the rat stomach fundus
reflects either the presence of multiple receptor subtypes or
the influence of endogenous metabolic processes which may
limit the actions of some but not all ligands. the present
study was designed to isolate homogeneous populations of
receptors from a possible mixed population and to define the
pharmacological characteristics of those which contribute to
the contractile response to 5-ht. care has been taken to
work as closely as possible to equilibrium conditions in order
to obtain an explicit pharmacological characterization of
putative contractile 5-ht2b receptors in rat stomach fundus.
to extend the pharmacological characterization of this receptor we have evaluated several recently described antagonists
including gr 127935, sb 204070 and sb 200646 which demonstrate high selectivity for 5-htld,  xxxg1117xxx  and 5-ht2c receptors respectively (skingle et al., 1993; wardle et al., 1993;
forbes et al., 1993).

methods
tissue preparation

ratios (concentration-ratio = ecs, test agonist ecso 5-ht)
and intrinsic activities relative to em. parameters obtained
from the preceding control concentration-effect curve to 5ht. on repetition, curves to 5-ht were highly reproducible
and ec50 location parameters differed by no more than 2
fold. for this reason, correction factors were not routinely
applied to account for changes in sensitivity between first and
second concentration-effect curves.

antagonist affinity affinity estimates for antagonists were
expressed as pa2 values, calculated according to the method
of arunlakshana & schild (1959) and by single point analysis
using the following equation (2).
pa2 = -log10 [b] + log10 [cr-1]
(2)
[b] represents the concentration of antagonist and cr
represents the ratio of ec50 location parameters for 2nd and
1st agonist concentration-effect curves in the presence and
absence of antagonist respectively. equation 2 was used only
if curve maxima for the 1st and 2nd concentration-effect
curves differed by no more than 5%.

compounds used

whole stomachs were obtained from male sprague dawley
rats (250-350 g) and strips of longitudinal muscle (1.01.5 x 20 mm) were dissected from the greater curvature of
the fundus and mounted between stainless steel hooks in
10 ml tissue baths containing oxygenated (95% 02/5% co2)
tyrode solution at 37'c. the composition of tyrode solution
was as follows (mm): nacl 136.9, kci 2.7, nah2po4 0.4,
mgcl2 1.0, glucose 5.6, nahco3 11.9, cacl2 1.8 and
indomethacin 0.003. after 15 min, tissues were 'primed' with
kci (50 mm) and over the following 45 min period were
exposed to an ec80 concentration of 5-ht (10 nm) at intervals of not less than 10 min until a consistent contractile
response (Â± 5% of previous response) was obtained. responses were recorded with dynamometer uh 1 isometric
transducers coupled either to a letromed mt8-channel chart
recorder or a maclab/8 (ad instruments) recording
system linked to an apple macintosh ii ci computer.
several experiments were performed to determine final experimental conditions. the findings are given in results and
led to the adoption of the following protocol. all
experiments were conducted after removal of the mucosae
and after tissues had been exposed to the irreversible
monamine oxidase (mao) inhibitor  xxxd2850xxx  (100 1m) for
15 min. for studies with  xxxd26xxx -5-ht,  xxxd2914xxx  (1i m)
was included in the tyrode solution. to remove the mucosae,
strips were pinned out with sufficient tension to allow the
mucosal layer to be pulled slightly away from underlying
muscle. the mucosae could then be easily removed with fine
dissecting scissors.

agonist potency agonist concentration-effect curves were
fitted using the following three parameter equation using
kaleidagraph (synergy software) on an apple macintosh ii
ci computer.

results

preliminary experiments
5-ht (1 nm- 10pm) did not cause relaxation of muscle strips
(2-2.5 mm x 20 mm) pre-contracted with either u46619,
carbachol or kci. in the absence of pre-contraction the

putative 5-ht2b receptors in rat fundus

non-cumulative addition of 5-ht evoked a concentrationdependent contractile response. accurate measurements of
responses, particularly to threshold concentrations of 5-ht,
were confounded by baseline instability which consisted of
periodic phasic and tonic contractions. concentrationresponse curves for 5-ht derived using these preparations
were not overtly biphasic but were shallow and often spanned 4 to 4.5 log units. after dissecting thinner muscle strips
(1-1.5 mm x 20 mm) to minimize the potential contribution
of circular muscle to the 5-ht induced contractile response
(offermeier & ariens, 1966) and after removal of the mucosal
layer, almost all spontaneous activity was abolished. these
modifications yielded concentration-response curves that
were steeper than those obtained using larger intact preparations (figure 1).
the maximum response to 5-ht was obtained at concentrations of 0.1-0.31jm and higher concentrations did not
evoke contractions of greater magnitude but induced a
marked phasic contractile activity which was not completely
reversed even upon washing preparations over a 2 h period.
several experiments were conducted to determine whether
5-ht receptors are located on the muscularis mucosa of the
stomach fundus. mucosal strips were carefully dissected away
from the underlying muscle and set up under the same
conditions as described for longitudinal muscle. although all
displayed marked spontaneous activity and all contracted on
exposure to kc1, none of the twelve strips tested responded
either to 5-ht or to carbachol (0.1 nm- 100 jam).
pretreatment of animals with reserpine (10 mg kg-' 16 h
prior to experiment) or pcpa (150-300mgkg-' for 3-5
days) had no effect on tissue responses to 5-ht, n > 4 for
each treatment (data not presented). likewise, responses to
5-ht were not affected by tetrodotoxin (0.1 m) nor by the
5-ht re-uptake inhibitors cocaine (10 nm-30 gm), paroxetine
(0.1 ijm) and fluoxetine (0.1 jam), n > 4 (data not presented).
corticosterone (30 jam) caused non-surmountable antagonism
of responses to 5-ht (table 2). these data indicated the use
of either tetrodotoxin or uptake inhibitors was unnecessary.
on exposure to  xxxd2850xxx  (100 jm), many tissues responded
with a slowly developing increase in basal tension which
returned to pre-exposure levels over the following 1 h equilibration period. the elevation in tension was reversed on addition of yohimbine (0.3 jm) or methiothepin (0.1 jam) but was
unaffected by pretreatment of animals with pcpa (150-300
mg kg-', i.p. for up to 5 days). location parameters of
concentration-effect curves for 5-ht were not influenced by
prior exposure of tissues to  xxxd2850xxx . however, concentration-effect curves to 5-meo-t and tryptamine were displaced 3.2 Â± 0.9 fold (n = 4) and 9.2 Â± 0.2 (n = 4) to the left
respectively. this sensitizing effect on 5-meo-t and trypc

tamine reflects the propensity of the more lipophilic
indoleamines to passive uptake and deamination by monamine oxidase and therefore  xxxd2850xxx  was used routinely in
all subsequent experiments.
changing from a non-cumulative to a cumulative dosing
protocol did not influence location parameters of concentration-effect curves to 5-ht (curve maxima Â± s.e.mean and
pec50 (95% cl) were 98.8 Â± 0.86, 8.56 (8.22-8.91) and
100.5 + 2.4, 8.51 (8.04-8.99), n = 4, for non-cumulative versus cumulative concentration-effect curves respectively). this
suggested that the receptor did not desensitize appreciably
over the time course of the curve and a cumulative dosing
procedure was adopted for all subsequent experiments.

agonist potency
under the conditions defined in preliminary experiments,
5-ht acted as a potent contractile agonist in longitudinal
muscle strips of rat fundus [mean pecm (95% cl) of 8.64
(8.53-8.76), n = 57] and produced well defined and monophasic concentration-effect curves. at lower concentrations,
responses to 5-ht were primarily phasic in nature and often
faded back to baseline, whereas higher concentrations evoked
responses comprising an initial phasic contraction followed
by a tonic component that showed limited fade (figure 2a).
5-meo-t, a-me-5-ht, 5-ct, and tryptamine were full
agonists with respect to 5-ht and produced qualitatively
similar responses (table 1, figure 3).  xxxd26xxx -5-ht possessed
bimodal activity causing contraction at lower concentrations

and phasic relaxations which were superimposed upon the
contractions as concentrations were increased (figure 2b).
the relaxant responses were abolished by  xxxd2914xxx 
(1 am) suggesting that a-adrenoceptors mediate the relaxant
response to this agonist.  xxxd2914xxx  (1 jam) had no effect
on responses to 5-ht. after blockade of a-adrenoceptors,
 xxxd26xxx -5-ht produced a monophasic concentration-response
curve and was a partial agonist with respect to 5-ht (table
1, figure 3).
several other compounds which are known to act as
agonists at either 5-ht2a or 5-ht2c receptors including
ru 24969, sch 23390 (hoyer et al., 1989) and mk 212
(conn & sanders-bush, 1987) were moderately potent
agonists in rat stomach fundus, whereas other compounds
known to be only weakly active at 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c
receptors including 8-oh-dpat, sumatriptan and  xxxd3097xxx 
were either weak or inactive (table 1). the putative 5-ht2c
selective agonist, m-cpp (see kennett, 1993) also possesses
agonist properties in rat fundus (clineschmidt et al., 1985).
in the present study, biphasic curves were often observed.
where biphasic curves were evident, the best fit (using equation 1) to the higher potency phase yielded a mean ec50
(95% cl) of 7.68 (7.62-7.94) and a variable intrinsic activity
(relative to the 5-ht maximum response) which ranged from

0.2-0.5. the lower potency phase of the curve for m-cpp
occurred over the range (1.0 gam- 100 am), was poorly defined
and difficult to quantify. the low potency phase of the
m-cpp concentration-effect curve was resistant to antagonism by yohimbine (0.3jm).

antagonist studies
several antagonists displayed complex behaviour in rat fundus. thus, ly 53857, methiothepin, ritanserin and ici
170809 were non-surmountable antagonists and produced
rightward displacement of 5-ht concentration-response
curves and a pronounced depression of the maximum response.  xxxd2621xxx  also caused a concentration-dependent
depression in the maximum response to 5-ht but this was
not associated with any significant rightward displacement of
concentration-effect curves for 5-ht. the effects of these
compounds on location parameters of 5-ht concentrationeffect curves are shown in table 2. in contrast, rauwolscine,
yohimbine, mesulergine,  xxxd2637xxx , wy 26703, sb 200646,
sb 204070, pirenpirone and  xxxd3097xxx  acted as surmountable antagonists evoking a concentration-dependent rightward displacement of concentration-effect curves for 5-ht
(table 3). full schild regression analysis was performed for
both yohimbine (figure 4a) and sb 200646 (figure 5a) and
yielded pa2 estimates of 7.9 and 7.5 with slopes of 1.06 and
0.85 respectively (figures 4a and b). yohimbine also
antagonized responses to several other agonists yielding an
agonist independent pa2 of approximately 7.8 (table 4).

putative 5-ht2b receptors in rat fundus

in a few instances, antagonists, in addition to causing
displacement of agonist concentration-effect curves also
caused a significant elevation in the maximum response. this
phenomenon was independent of both the agonist and
antagonist used but correlated with the occurrence of a low
level of spontaneous activity prior to and during the con-

struction of control concentration-effect curves and a reduction of this activity after exposure to the antagonist.
as m-cpp was a weak partial agonist in rat fundus it was
also examined as an antagonist of 5-ht. in preparations in
which m-cpp (0.1 gm) produced only a small response or
failed to evoke a response, a subsequent concentration-effect

up to and including 1.o;1m.
several experiments were conducted to address the
existence of a phenoxybenzamine-resistant tryptamine receptor (winter & gessner, 1968). responses to 5-ht were
abolished in tissues which had been exposed to phenoxybenzamine (10 tim for 30 min). in the same tissues tryptamine
(up to 100 jsm) did not evoke a contractile response.

discussion
the aim of the present study was to isolate single populations of receptors which contribute to the contractile response to 5-ht receptor agonists in the rat stomach fundus
isolated longitudinal muscle preparation in order to obtain
an explicit pharmacological profile of the contractile 5-ht
receptors in this tissue. this may then allow a more definitive
comparison with the cloned  xxxg1114xxx . to achieve this
aim it was necessary to account for endogenous factors that
may complicate the interpretation of both agonist and
antagonist data and steps were taken to ensure that
experiments were conducted as closely as possible to equilibrium conditions.
in preliminary studies it was found that intact strips of
stomach fundus possessed considerable spontaneous contractile activity which prevented accurate measurement of responses at threshold concentrations of agonists. this activity
appeared to be generated by the muscularis mucosa as, when
separated, the mucosal layer still displayed marked activity
whilst the muscularis externa did not.
shallow concentration-effect curves for tryptamines are
commonly observed in rat stomach fundus (clineschmidt et
al., 1985; buchheit et al., 1985) and have been cited as
evidence for multiple 5-ht receptor subtypes (foguet et
al.,1992b). however, in preparations which were dissected as
thinly as practical and from which the mucosae had been
removed, concentration-effect curves for 5-ht were found to
be steeper when compared to the larger, intact muscle strips.
it is possible that the process of stripping away the mucosal
layer has removed a second site which contributes to 5-htinduced contraction. indeed, 5-ht has been shown to evoke
a contractile response in muscularis mucosae taken from the
fundus region of rat stomach (horn & zweifach, 1963).
unfortunately these findings could not be reproduced in the
present study and the character of a putative mucosal receptor could not be evaluated. an alternative possibility is that a
small component of circular muscle layer which lies perpendicular to the longitudinal muscle, contributes to the shallow
profile of concentration-effect curves (offermeir & ariens,
1966). in this regard, 5-ht is reported to induce contraction
in circular muscle which is of lower potency relative to that

observed in longitudinal muscle preparations (vane, 1959). a
summation of effects mediated by multiple units of tissues
has been proposed to explain a similar transition from shallow to steep curves for cck-8 after dissection of smaller
preparations of guinea-pig gall bladder (bishop et al., 1992).
it is perhaps relevant to point out that sensitivities of
preparations to 5-ht and other tryptamines with similar
intrinsic activity were approximately 0.5 log units greater
than those observed by other investigators (clineschmidt et
al.,1985; kalkman & fozard, 1991; wainscott et al., 1993).
whether this increase in sensitivity can be explained entirely
by the steepening of concentration-effect curves (i.e. preventing an overestimation of ec50 parameters) or by the
presence of additional metabolic processes in intact muscle
strips is not known.
in the present study cocaine, paroxetine, fluoxetine and
corticosterone caused no sensitization to 5-ht and thus
failed to provide evidence for the existence of either neuronal
or extra-neuronal uptake processes for 5-ht in rat stomach
fundus. these findings are supported by earlier studies which
demonstrated very little tissue accumulation of [3h]-5-ht
(handschumacher & vane, 1963; 1967).
as responses to 5-ht were unaffected by both indomethacin and tetrodotoxin, an involvement of endogenous
prostaglandins or neurotransmitters is unlikely. likewise, responses to 5-ht were unaffected by pretreatment of animals
with either reserpine or pcpa suggesting little role for either
catecholamines or a pcpa-sensitive pool of 5-ht. however,
several observations were perhaps compatible with the
presence of a pcpa-resistant pool which could release
biologically active levels of 5-ht. thus pcpa pretreatment
(150mg kg-' for up to 5 days) failed to prevent an infrequently observed, methiothepin- and yohimbine-sensitive
increase in baseline tension after exposure of tissues to  xxxd2850xxx .
it is important to note that the  xxxd2850xxx -induced elevation
in baseline tension was absent in the majority of preparations
but where present, it was reversed after repeated washout
over the equilibration period. whilst it is unlikely that the
presence of low levels of endogenous 5-ht had any profound
influence on the profile of most pharmacological agents
tested in rat fundus, the possibility of some minor influence
cannot be discounted. thus, blockade of an elevation in
baseline tension or some other adaptive change (i.e. desensitization) mediated by endogenous 5-ht may account for
the observed elevation in maximum response to agonists after
subsequent exposure of preparations to antagonists. such a
mechanism has been considered in detail to explain an elevation in maximum response to 5-ht at  xxxg1117xxx  receptors in rat
oesophagus after exposure to the antagonist, dau 6285
(waikar et al., 1992). the effects of  xxxd2850xxx  on baseline
tissue state indicates that mao plays an important role in
modulating the actions of endogenously synthesized 5-ht. it
has been shown previously that mao may also inactivate
exogenously administered tryptamines and lead to a significant underestimation of potency (vane, 1959). this illustrates the influence of endogenous metabolic processes on the
observed pharmacological profile of a receptor system. these
findings were supported in the present study by the observation that inhibition of mao resulted in potentiation of responses to both tryptamine and 5-meo-t, whereas responses
to 5-ht were unaffected. for this reason, and despite the
influence of  xxxd2850xxx  on endogenous 5-ht levels, it was
considered important to conduct all experiments after inhibition of mao. although the effect of mao inhibition on
other agonists was not examined directly, it is highly probable that these findings could be extended to other lipophilic
tryptamine analogues which may penetrate the cell via passive diffusion (vane, 1959).
reports relating to a putative 'phenoxybenzamine resistant
tryptamine receptor' (winter & gessner, 1968) and the
occurrence of biphasic concentration-effect curves for
ru24969 and certain tryptamines (buchheit et al., 1985)

putative 5-ht2b receptors in rat fundus

have also led to speculation that 5-ht receptor agonists
interact with multiple sites in rat stomach fundus. in the
present study, no compelling evidence was found to support
this view. responses to tryptamine were abolished after
exposure of tissues to phenoxybenzamine and biphasic curves
to tryptamines and ru 24969 were not observed. the reason
for the discrepancy is not known although as already discussed, it is possible that these agonists possess additional
properties in intact preparations. only  xxxd26xxx -5-ht displayed
complex behaviour in rat fundus, evoking mixed contractile/
relaxant responses. sensitivity to  xxxd2914xxx  suggests
that the relaxant phase was mediated via activation of aladrenoceptors which are reported to be present in rat fundus
(kelly & macdonald, 1990). in the presence of  xxxd2914xxx ,  xxxd26xxx -5-ht, like 5-ht, a-me-5-ht, 5-ct, 5-meo-t
and tryptamine evoked well defined and monophasic concentration-effect curves with a profile consistent with that
predicted for an agonist acting at a single class of receptors.
furthermore, exposure of tissues to antagonists of varied
structural classes and with varied selectivity for 5-ht receptors, failed to expose a second site. indeed, studies with
yohimbine yielded an agonist independent pa2 of 7.8,
indicating a common site of action for each agonist.
under the conditions defined in preliminary experiments,
the following tryptamine 'fingerprint' was obtained; 5-meot > a-me- 5-ht > 5-ht > 5-ct > tryptamine > 2 - me-5-ht.
the low potency of both 5-ct and  xxxd26xxx -5-ht relative to
5-ht, indicated that 5-hti-like, 5.htia, or 5-ht3 receptors
did not play a significant role. this view is supported by the
poor activity of the selective 5-htla and 5-htib/ld agonists
8-oh-dpat and sumatriptan and by a low affinity for
granisetron, ics 205930, spiperone (hoyer, 1989) and the
recently described antagonist, gr 127935, which possesses
high affinity for 5-htid, 5-htdp and 5-hti-like receptors in
dog basilar artery (skingle et al., 1993). the low affinity of
gr 127935 presents compelling evidence against a role for a
variant of the 5-htld receptor in rat stomach fundus as
originally proposed by kalkman & fozard (1991).
whilst modifications to the assay have resulted in a
significantly increased sensitivity to 5-ht and several related
agonists, the tryptamine fingerprint agrees well with that
determined previously in rat stomach fundus (kalkman &
fozard, 1991). it is similar to that expected for activation of
either 5-ht2a or 5-ht2c subtypes (hoyer et al., 1989; leff &
martin, 1988) and support its inclusion in the  xxxg1113xxx 
family. the tryptamine profile is also somewhat similar to
that observed at  xxxg1117xxx  receptors (baxter et al., 1991) but a
role for  xxxg1117xxx  receptors is unlikely, as dau 6285 was not an
antagonist at concentrations at least 10 fold in excess of its
equilibrium dissociation constant for  xxxg1117xxx  receptors (turconi et al.,1991). furthermore, the pa2 for the  xxxg1117xxx 
antagonist sb204070 in rat fundus (table 3) was approximately 1000 fold higher than its apparent pa2 at  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors (wardle et al., 1993). the absence of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors is further supported by the lack of intrinsic efficacy of
the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonist,  xxxd3097xxx  (baxter et al., 1991),
although it is interesting to note that  xxxd3097xxx  was a weak
antagonist of 5-ht in rat fundus as it also acts as an
antagonist at putative 5-ht,p receptors in the enteric nervous
system (mawe et al., 1989). however, a role for 5-ht,p
receptors is also unlikely in that 5-meo-t, which was
amongst the most potent of the agonists tested in rat fundus,
is reported to possess neither affinity nor efficacy at 5-ht1p
receptors (takaki et al., 1985; branchek et al., 1988).
on the basis of antagonist affinity, the low affinity of
pirenpirone, spiperone and  xxxd2419xxx  indicate clear pharmacological differentiation between the contractile 5-ht
receptors in rat fundus and 5-ht2a receptors but do not
allow discrimination from the 5-ht2c or 5-ht2b subtypes. a
close pharmacological affiliation of contractile 5-ht receptors in rat stomach fundus and 5-ht2c receptors has been
recognized for some time (buchheit et al., 1985; and see
wainscott et al., 1993). this relationship is further supported

329

by the observation that sb 200646, which shows some 50
fold selectivity for rat and human 5-ht2c receptors over
5-htla, 5-htld, 5-ht2a, 5-ht3 and  xxxg1117xxx  receptors (forbes
et al., 1993; wood et al., 1993) also acts as a moderately
potent antagonist of 5-ht in rat fundus and possesses a
similar affinity to that observed at 5-ht2c receptors. furthermore, the potent and selective  xxxg1117xxx  antagonist, sb 204070,
which possesses a moderate affinity for 5-ht2c receptors (pki
= 6.9, see wardle et al., 1993) also displayed a similar, albeit
slightly higher affinity versus 5-ht in rat fundus
of all the ligands tested in the present study only yohimbine and rauwolscine will permit clear discrimination of
cloned 5-ht2b receptors and 5-ht receptors in rat fundus
from both 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c (clineschmidt et al., 1985;
hoyer, 1989). in earlier studies, clineschmidt et al. (1985)
tested several compounds on the basis of their structural
similarity to yohimbine. one of these, wy 26703 (lattimer et
al., 1984) was a moderately potent antagonist in rat fundus, a
finding supported in the present study. like yohimbine and
rauwolscine, wy 26703 possesses low affinity (pki< 6.0) for
5-ht2c receptors in piglet choroid plexus (unpublished observation) and all three compounds may therefore represent key
ligands for the identification of 5-ht2b receptors in vitro.
unfortunately, these compounds also demonstrate significant
affinity for other 5-ht and non-5-ht receptors (lattimer et
al., 1984; hoyer, 1989) and are therefore not likely to yield
useful information relating to 5-ht2b mediated function in
more complex in vivo systems. in this regard, sb 200646,
whilst possessing significant affinity for the  xxxg1115xxx ,
is otherwise a reasonably selective antagonist for the putative
 xxxg1114xxx  in rat fundus and may prove useful for
characterization of  xxxg1114xxx  function in. vivo.
sb 200646 is reported to attenuate m-cpp induced anxiogenic-like activity in rats (kennett et al., 1993). although it is
likely that these effects are mediated by blockade of 5-ht2c
receptors, the observations that both m-cpp (clineschmidt et
al., 1985 and present study) and sb 200646 interact with
putative 5-ht2b receptors in rat fundus, may lead to speculation that these effects may be partly mediated via modulation
of  xxxg1114xxx  function. it is important to note however
that although 5-ht2b mrna has been identified in mouse
cerebellum (loric et al., 1992), it has so far not been detected
in rat brain (foguet et al., 1992b).
the affinity and enantiomeric selectivity of yohimbine and
rauwolscine for putative 5-ht2b receptors in rat stomach
fundus support the earlier observations of clineschmidt et al.
(1985) and kalkman & fozard (1991) but differ somewhat
from values obtained at cloned 5-ht2b receptors. rauwolscine is consistently 10 fold more potent in rat fundus than at
the cloned  xxxg1114xxx  (compare clineschmidt et al.,
1985; kalkman & fozard, 1991; foguet et al., 1992b; wainscott et al., 1993; present study). furthermore, rauwolscine
possesses a 3 to 10 fold higher affinity than yohimbine in rat
fundus but approximately equal affinities at the cloned receptor. it has been proposed that these and other differences
may be explained by the presence of multiple 5-ht receptor
subtypes in rat stomach fundus (foguet et al., 1992b). the
data obtained in the present study are not consistent with
that view. it is also possible that the differences are intrinsic
to the unnatural expression of the cloned  xxxg1114xxx 
(foguet et al., 1992a,b), but an alternative explanation, that
the stomach fundus receptor is closely related but not identical to the cloned  xxxg1114xxx  cannot be ruled out.
indeed, the close pharmacological identity of the structurally
distinct 5-htid, and 5-htidp receptor subtypes may be
viewed as a precedent (hartig et al., 1992). other 'orphan'
receptors have been identified in the rat which show pharmacological similarities to both 5-ht2b and  xxxg1115xxx 
subtypes (bodelsson et al., 1993). the possibility that closely
related receptors are also present in the rat stomach fundus,
either on blood vessels or other tissue elements, cannot be
discounted. it is also worth re-iterating that the character of
the receptor which mediates a contractile response to 5-ht in

330

g.s. baxter et al.

the circular muscle of the stomach fundus (vane, 1959) is still
unknown.
in conclusion, we have isolated what appears to be a single
class of receptors mediating a contractile response to 5-ht in
longitudinal muscle of rat stomach fundus. data obtained
with both agonist and antagonist probes, each with varied
activity at the established 5-ht receptor subtypes, failed to
indicate the presence of multiple 5-ht receptor subtypes. the
pharmacological profile of the receptor in rat fundus suggests
the closest affiliation to the cloned  xxxg1114xxx  and
supports its original definition as a novel 5-ht receptor
subtype (cohen & wittenauer, 1985; cohen & colbert, 1986;

cohen & fludzinski, 1987; blackburn et al., 1988; baez et
al., 1991). in this regard our finding that sb 200646 possesses
high selectivity for putative 5-ht2b receptors in rat stomach
fundus should permit confirmation of the relationship
between this site and cloned 5-ht2b receptors and a greater
understanding of the relevance of the  xxxg1114xxx  to
physiological and pathophysiological processes.
