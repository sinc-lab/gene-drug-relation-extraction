central adenosinergic system involvement in  xxxd102xxx induced motor incoordination in mice.  to clarify if the behavioral interaction between ethanol and adenosine reported previously occur centrally or due to a peripheral hemodynamic change, the effect of i.c.v. adenosine agonists, n6-(r-phenylisopropyl)adenosine (r-pia), n6-(s-phenylisopropyl)adenosine, 5'-(n-cyclopropyl)-carboxamidoadenosine, antagonists, theophylline and 8-p-(sulfophenyl)theophylline as well as  xxxd1999xxx  on ethanol-(i.p.)-induced motor incoordination was evaluated by rotorod. adenosine agonists and antagonists dose dependently accentuated and attenuated, respectively,  xxxd102xxx induced motor incoordination, thereby suggesting a central mechanism of adenosine modulation of this effect of ethanol and confirmed our previous reports in which adenosine agonists and antagonists were given i.p.  xxxd1999xxx , a weak adenosine antagonist but potent inhibitor of  xxxd1773xxx  phosphodiesterase, did not alter ethanol's motor incoordination, further supporting involvement of brain adenosine receptor mechanism(s) in  xxxd102xxx adenosine interactions. results from r-pia and n6-(s-phenylisopropyl)adenosine experiments showed nearly a 40-fold greater potency of r-vs. s-diastereoisomer, suggesting predominance of adenosine a1 subtype. however, 5'-(n-cyclopropyl)-carboxamidoadenosine data indicate complexity of the mechanism(s) and point toward an additional involvement of a yet unknown subtype of adenosine a2. no effect of ethanol on blood or brain levels of [3h]r-pia was noted and sufficient amount of the latter entered the brain to suggest adenosine receptor activation adequate to produce behavioral interaction with ethanol. there was no escape of i.c.v.-administered [3h]r-pia from brain to the peripheral circulation ruling out a peripheral and supporting a central mechanism of  xxxd102xxx adenosine interaction.(abstract truncated at 250 words).
