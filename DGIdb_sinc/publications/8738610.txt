summary
progression of breast cancer from an estrogen-dependent, slowly growing tumor amenable to tamoxifen
treatment to an aggressive, metastatic, estrogen-independent phenotype has been mimicked by the
transfection of mcf-7 breast carcinoma cells with fibroblast growth factors 1 or 4. fgf-transfected cells
are aggressively tumorigenic in ovariectomized or tamoxifen-treated nude mice, conditions under which
the parental cells would not produce tumors. when detection of metastasis was enhanced by lacz transfection, the fgf-transfected mcf-7 cells were reliably metastatic to lymph nodes and frequently metastatic
to lungs, in further contrast to parental cells. an antiangiogenic drug,  xxxd1330xxx , given to mice beating
tumors produced by fgf-transfected mcf-7 cells, produced a decrease in tumor size. the decreased
tumor size was not as marked as that produced by treatment with  xxxd2878xxx , an agent which
would abrogate all autocrine or paracrine effects of the transfected fgf. thus, increased angiogenesis may
be a component of the phenotypic change produced by the fgf transfection, but other autocrine or
paracrine effects may also be important.
since a clonal  xxxg789xxx  and lacz doubly-transfected cell line,  xxxg1411xxx -4, progressively lost expression of
the transfected lacz gene in individual cells, we performed successive rounds of fluorescence-activated cell
sorting to select high-expressing cells. high-expressing cell populations thus obtained rapidly lost expression of b-gal activity in continued culture. high b-gal expressing clonal cell lines of  xxxg1411xxx -4 cells established by either one or two rounds of low-density cloning also lost lacz expression with continued culture.
southern analysis of dna from lacz transfected cell lines showed the transfected sequences to be present
and grossly intact in both high and low expressing populations. however, northern analysis revealed that
high-expressing populations of  xxxg1411xxx -4 cells contained the most lacz mrna, implying that in the unstable
 xxxg1411xxx -4 cell line, individual cells are down-regulating mrna levels of lacz. stable lacz expression has
been obtained in other fgf-transfected and parental mcf-7 cell lines using the same expression vector.
thus, the  xxxg1411xxx -4 cell line is down-regulating mrna encoding the transfected gene through a mechanism
not dependent on the cmv promotor utilized in the expression vector. this evidence suggests that lacz
expression is not a benign modification in certain cells.

introduction
recent evidence has indicated that the ability of
a tumor to induce new blood vessel formation is
an important parameter in determining prognosis
of breast carcinoma [1-6]. in addition, several
kinds of tumors have been shown to become more
aggressive upon acquisition of an angiogenic
phenotype [7,8]. thus, evidence is emerging
which links increased angiogenic capability with
increased aggressiveness of the tumor.
the
fibroblast growth factors (fgfs) are a family of
angiogenic growth factors which have been shown
to be expressed in both normal and malignant
mammary tissues and cells [9-14]. we have
found expression of fgfs in specimens from
human breast carcinomas and breast carcinoma
cell lines [15,16]. to investigate the effect of
expression of an angiogenic growth factor in
breast carcinoma, we have separately transfected
mcf-7 cells, a cell line which is estrogendependent for tumor formation in ovariectomized
nude mice, with expression vectors for either
 xxxg786xxx  or  xxxg789xxx . in contrast to the parental cells,
the resultant fgf-transfected cell lines are
aggressively tumorigenic when injected into the
mammary fat pads of ovariectomized or tamoxifen-treated nude mice [17,18].
tumors also
develop in animals treated with  xxxd2165xxx ,780, an
antiestrogen devoid of partial agonist activity
[19]. in addition, although the tumors formed by
parental cells in estrogen-supplemented mice are
rarely metastatic, tumors produced by fgf-transfected cells frequently form micrometastases in
regional lymph nodes and lungs [17,18,20]. micrometastases appear in tumor-bearing mice treated
with tamoxifen [17] and  xxxd2165xxx ,780 (unpublished
data), as well as drugs purported to be antiangiogenic (see below) [21].
although  xxxg786xxx  or  xxxg789xxx  transfected mcf-7
cells exhibit many similar characteristics, the
tumors they produce often have a different appearance. the  xxxg789xxx  transfected cells produce
solid tumors which grow progressively and seem
abundantly vascularized [17]. the  xxxg786xxx  transfected cells produce solid, well-vascularized

tumors which are often surrounded by a large sac
filled with bloody exudate. this sac is often
many times larger than the tumor itself. with
time, the tumor grows to fill the sac and the
bloody exudate is reabsorbed [18]. the composition of the sac and bloody fluid are currently
under investigation in our laboratory. however,
the different appearance of the tumors produced
by  xxxg786xxx  or  xxxg789xxx  transfectants provides evidence that the two fgf ligands are differentially
activating different cells or effector systems in the
host mouse.
the effects produced by the transfection of
either  xxxg786xxx  or  xxxg789xxx  could be due to either
autocrine effects of the transfected fgf on the
tumor cells themselves, paracrine effects of the
transfected fgf on host cells, or most likely, a
combination of both. thus, these tumor models
of  xxxg786xxx  or  xxxg789xxx  transfected mcf-7 cells can
be used to investigate the in vivo phenotypic
transition from a noninvasive, nonmetastatic,
estrogen-dependent tumor to an invasive, metastatic, antiestrogen-resistant one. we feel that
defining the parameters leading to this phenotypic
transition would provide important information
that would be applicable to human tumors making
similar transitions.

fgfs and fgf receptors
while members of the fgf ligand and receptor
family at first seem to be somewhat ubiquitous in
their expression and promiscuous in their activity,
there is evidence for specificity of activity of both
ligands and receptors [22-25]. a review of what
is known concerning ligands and receptors pertinent to our system is provided here.
the fgf family currently has nine identified
members [25-28] which share sequence homology
and have varying affinity for the fgf receptors.
both  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxg789xxx  have been shown to have
growth-stimulatory and transforming effects on
fibroblasts and growth-stimulatory effects on
endothelial cells [25]. growth-stimulatory effects

fgf-overexpressing cells as models of angiogenesis and metastasis
of  xxxg786xxx ,  xxxg787xxx , and  xxxg789xxx  on epithelial cells
have also been reported [29-32], and we find
 xxxg789xxx  to moderately stimulate both anchoragedependent and anchorage-independent growth of
mcf-7 cells under estrogen-depleted conditions
(data not shown).
we have found expression of fgfs, most
often  xxxg786xxx , in breast carcinoma tissues, and
expression of various fgfs in estrogen-independent breast carcinoma cell lines [15,33]. specific
antagonists of fgfs have not been identified.
however,  xxxd2878xxx  (pps), an agent
which seems to abrogate the effects of heparinbinding growth factors, of which fgfs are one
class, has been shown to abrogate tumorigenicity
produced in an adrenal carcinoma cell line by
transfection of  xxxg789xxx  [34]. as mentioned below,
this agent also decreases the size of tumors
produced by  xxxg789xxx  or  xxxg786xxx  transfected mcf-7
cells [21]. these data, taken together, provide
suggestive evidence that fgfs might be important
in the autocrine or paracrine stimulation of breast
tumor growth.
four similar genes ( xxxg791xxx ,  xxxg792xxx ,  xxxg793xxx , and
 xxxg794xxx ) have been identified which encode four
similar fgf receptors. these receptors have an
extracellular domain which contains two or three
immunoglobulin loop structures and an acidic
box, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain which contains a split tyrosine
kinase [22-24]. occupation of the receptors by
ligand promotes receptor dimerization, receptor
tyrosine autophosphorylation, and intracellular
substrate binding and tyrosine phosphorylation
[35]. while the downstream effects of activation
offgfr-l, xxxg792xxx , andfgfr-3 may ultimately lead to
cell proliferation, in at least in one cell system
 xxxg794xxx  activation seems not to be linked to mitogenesis [36]. in some cases, fgf receptor activation can lead to growth inhibition [16,37] or differentiation [38].
the  xxxg791xxx  and  xxxg792xxx  genes both have a multiplicity of transcripts and protein products which
arise via exon shuffling and alternative splicing.
receptor proteins formed from alternative transcripts may have either two or three immunoglobu-

105

lin loops, juxtamembrane deletions, a kinase defective intracellular domain, or be truncated at the
extracellular-transmembrane junction so that the
truncated receptor is secreted. these variant
receptor proteins can have dramatically different
affinity for fgf ligands [22-24]. similar to what
has been found for fgjr-1 and  xxxg792xxx , the mouse
 xxxg793xxx  gene has recently been shown to have
alternative transcripts which contain one of two
alternative exons (iiib and iiic) for the last half
of the third immunoglobulin loop. as had been
shown for  xxxg791xxx  and  xxxg792xxx , the  xxxg793xxx  isoforms
also have different affinities for different fgf
ligands [22-24,39]. alternative transcripts for
 xxxg794xxx  have not been described.
 xxxg786xxx  has high affinity for  xxxg791xxx , the iiic
form of  xxxg792xxx ,  xxxg793xxx , and  xxxg794xxx . the
affinity of  xxxg789xxx  for all the possible receptors has
not been characterized but it does have high affinity for some isoforms of  xxxg791xxx  and  xxxg792xxx  as
well as one isoform of  xxxg793xxx  and  xxxg794xxx  [2224,40,41]. a fifth fgfr gene, which is not a
 xxxg2198xxx  but which contains cysteine-rich
domains, has been identified.  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxg789xxx 
have high affinity for this receptor also [42].
utilizing rnase protection assays with probes
for fgfrs 1 through 4, we have found fgfr mrna
expression in breast carcinoma cell lines and
breast carcinoma tissues to be essentially ubiquitous, although the abundance of particular
transcripts varied [15,16]. in particular, we did
not find any differences in fgfr expression between parental mcf-7 cells and  xxxg789xxx  transfected mcf-7 cells (data not shown). since we
have not utilized probes which will specifically
detect particular isoforms offgfrs 1 through 3, we
cannot say whether specificity of fgf response in
a particular tissue or tumor is due to specific
ligand expression, specific receptor expression, or
both. however, as mentioned,  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxg789xxx 
transfected mcf-7 cells produce different-appearing tumors in nude mice, evidence that specificity
of response due to specific ligand expression is a
possibility.

autocrine vs paracrine?

although  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxg789xxx  have been shown to
be angiogenic factors and endothelial cell mitogens [25], they are also mitogenic for fibroblasts
and for some epithelial cells, including mcf-7
cells themselves [29-31,43].
as mentioned,
fgfrs are widely distributed on many cell types,
including mcf-7 cells. therefore, the question
arises as to whether the more aggressively
tumorigenic, metastatic phenotype exhibited by
the fgf-transfected mcf-7 cells is due to
autocrine growth effects of the transfected fgf
on the tumor cells themselves, paracrine effects
on supporting stromal cells, including endothelial
cells, or a combination of both.
if the in vivo effect of the transfection of
mcf-7 cells with fgfs were autocrine, we might
expect to see altered growth of the transfected
cells in vitro. however, the in vitro growth of
fgf-transfected cells is not substantially different
from the parental mcf-7 cells. the transfected
cells do have a higher rate of growth under estrogen-depleted conditions and also form more
colonies in soft agar than the parental cells under
these conditions. however, the transfected cells
are growth-stimulated by estrogen as are the
parental cells, and tamoxifen inhibits the growthstimulatory effects of estrogen in vitro [17,18].
because in vivo growth requirements may be
quite different from those in vitro, lack of large in
vitro differences between the transfected and
parental cells does not rule out autocrine effects
as being partially responsible for the in vivo
phenotypic change produced by the transfection.
however, a large body of evidence implicates
fgfs, including  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxg789xxx  [14,25,44,45],
in endothelial cell growth stimulation and angiogenesis. thus, although the sum of phenotypic
changes in this tumor system may be due to multiple effects of fgfs on multiple host and tumor
factors, it is possible that at least some of the in
vivo changes in tumorigenicity, growth, response
to hormones, and metastatic behavior are due to
increased angiogenesis. we have therefore investigated the relationship between increased vascu-

larity of the tumors produced by fgf-transfected
cells to the parameters of tumor size and metastasis.

inhibiting angiogenesis or inhibiting fgf
action decreases tumor size

we sought to determine whether the increased
tumor growth observed with fgf-transfected cells
was mediated by increased blood vessel growth
by giving  xxxd1330xxx , a purported angiogenesis
inhibitor, to tumor-bearing mice.  xxxd1330xxx  (aka
 xxxd1330xxx ) is preferentially toxic for endothelial
cells in vitro [46,47], and has been shown to be
preferentially cytostatic for endothelial cells in
vivo [48] and to inhibit growth of tumors [49-53].
we also tested the effect of  xxxd2878xxx 
(pps), an agent which seems to abrogate the
effects of heparin-binding growth factors [54], of
which fgfs are one class. pps has been shown
to abrogate tumorigenicity produced in an adrenal
carcinoma cell line by transfection of  xxxg789xxx  [34].
we administered  xxxd1330xxx  and pps separately or together to mice beating tumors produced
by  xxxg786xxx  or  xxxg789xxx  transfected cells and otherwise untreated or treated with a sustained release
tamoxifen pellet. in four separate experiments,
three utilizing  xxxg786xxx  transfectants and one utilizing  xxxg789xxx  transfectants,  xxxd1330xxx  treatment
produced a decrease in mean tumor volume.
however, greater effects were seen with pps.
since the degree of effect of either drug should be
dose dependent and we may not have been using
maximal doses, rigorous comparison of these two
drugs in these experiments is not possible.
however, since pps presumably abrogates both
autocrine and paracrine effects of the transfected
fgf, the reliable effect of pps in these experiments is evidence that both autocrine and paracrine effects are important for tumor growth. in
addition, the effect of  xxxd1330xxx  provides evidence for the importance of angiogenesis in
growth of these tumors [21].

fgf-overexpressing cells as models of angiogenesis and metastasis

investigations of metastasis
we [17,18,20,21] and others [55-61] have utilized
carcinoma cells tagged with a transfected gene
encoding bacterial lacz to detect micrometastases
in animals injected with these cells. the expression of this bacterial gene can be revealed with a
chromogenic substrate, x-gal, under specific
conditions which favor activity of the transfected
i]-galactosidase (~-gal) enzyme but not endogenous lysosomal galactosidase activity. this can be
a very sensitive method for such detection, revealing micrometastases consisting of a few or even
single cells [20,59].
utilizing conventional hematoxylin and eosin
staining of lymph nodes and organs, we were able
to show that  xxxg789xxx  transfected mcf-7 cells had
an increased incidence of metastasis when compared with parental cells (23% of tumors produced by  xxxg789xxx  transfectants produced metastases
vs 5% of parental cells) [17]. when ~-gal-expressing  xxxg789xxx  transfected mcf-7 cells were
used to produce the primary tumors, however, xgal staining of proximal lymph nodes revealed
metastases in 100% of nodes from animals
bearing a tumor whose volume was greater than
100 mm 3. an increased incidence of metastasis
in distal lymph nodes and lungs over that detected
by conventional methods was also noted using
this technique. in addition, rare metastases to
other organs not previously known to be the site
of metastasis were detected. in that study, the
number of metastatic foci in lymph nodes and
lungs was positively correlated with tumor size
[20]. an increased ability to detect metastasis
was also seen with estrogen-treated mice bearing
tumors produced by lacz transfected parental
mcf-7 cells when compared to the frequency
with which metastases were observed in random
hematoxylin and eosin stained sections. however,
the frequency of metastasis was still substantially
lower than for the lacz expressing  xxxg789xxx  transfectants. in addition, the metastases detected in
mice bearing parental cell tumors were substantially smaller than those detected in mice bearing
tumors produced by the  xxxg789xxx  transfectants [20].

107

since  xxxg789xxx  is a secreted product, we asked
whether the secreted  xxxg789xxx  could exert its effect
in promoting tumor growth and metastasis on
parental cells contained within a tumor.  xxxg789xxx 
transfected mcf-7 cells and [3-gal expressing
parental cells were mixed and injected into the
mammary fat pads of ovariectomized untreated or
tamoxifen-treated mice, conditions under which
parental cells would not be tumorigenic. in both
untreated and tamoxifen-treated ovariectomized
mice, x-gal staining revealed the l]-gal expressing
parental cells in the primary tumors and in lung
and lymph node metastases [17]. these data
provide support for the view that the acquisition
of metastatic capability by a subpopulation of
cells within a tumor may provide a means for
other noncapable cells in the tumor to colonize
distant sites, possibly via tumor emboli.
in the experiments utilizing  xxxd1330xxx  and
pps described above, proximal and distal lymph
nodes and organs (spleen, liver, kidneys, lungs,
heart, and brain) were examined with x-gal staining and metastases were scored according to size
of a single focus or extent of multiple foci.
because of the problems we had experienced concerning the stability of lacz expression in the
 xxxg789xxx  transfectants, outlined below, three of the
four experiments in this group utilized  xxxg786xxx 
transfectants, whose lacz expression is stable.
(the parental cell line for the  xxxg786xxx  transfectants
was the lacz transfected mcf-7 clonal cell line
ml-20, which stably expresses the transfected
lacz gene.) however, in spite of the low level of
[3-gal expression in the  xxxg789xxx  transfectants, we
would expect positively staining metastases in the
experiment utilizing them to be proportionally the
same in all treatment groups and therefore comparable within the experiment. since we had previously shown that the extent of metastasis was
correlated with tumor size [20], we asked whether
the drug treatment with  xxxd1330xxx  or pps would
decrease metastasis to a greater extent than would
be expected from the decrease in tumor size
produced by each drug. metastases were rated on
a scale of 1 to 4 depending on their size or the
number of foci. data for each mouse regarding

levels of 13-gal activity in the facs histogram in figure 2. clone 20 was the parental line of clone 20g, depicted here. as
shown, despite these repeated selections, these cells are still losing lacz expression approximately 10 passages after selection.

method: cultured cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and fixed for 5 minutes with 2%
formaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde. fixative was removed by washing three times with pbs, leaving the last wash in place
for 10 minutes. cells were placed in a solution of 1 mg/ml x-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-13-d-galactopyranoside),5 mm
potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, and 2 mm mgci2 in pbs at 37 Â° overnight. following staining, cells
were further fixed for 24 hours in 10% buffered formalin and kept in pbs until photographed.

fgf-overexpressing cells as models of angiogenesis and metastasis

extent of metastasis were correlated with tumor
size within each experiment for each treatment
group. surprisingly, the extent of lymphatic or
pulmonary metastases, as revealed by x-gal
staining, was not significantly decreased beyond
what would be expected by the decrease in tumor
size produced by  xxxd1330xxx  or pps [21]. these
results extend and verify the results of two of us
[62] with respect to growth inhibition and
inhibition of angiogenesis by  xxxd1330xxx  in
tumors produced by  xxxg789xxx  transfected mcf-7
cells. in that report, metastasis was also decreased by  xxxd1330xxx  treatment, but no attempt
was made to correct the data for tumor size.
since in our experiments, both  xxxd1330xxx  and
pps did produce a decrease in tumor size but not
a decrease in metastasis when tumor size was
taken into account, these data support the view
that tumor growth and metastasis are distinct
processes which have different determinants.

problems with lacz expression
transfected marker genes, such as lacz, are typically placed under transcriptional control of a
strong constitutive promotor. we have utilized
the immediate early gene promotor of the cytomegalovirus in our eukaryotic expression vectors
to drive transcription of lacz [20] as well as other
transfected cdnas [ 17,18,63]. this promotor has
been shown to drive high levels of transfected
gene expression in many systems, and we have
obtained indefinitely stable high levels of expression of many transfected genes using these
vectors. in the past, however, in spite of use of
the cmv promotor in our expression vectors, we
have twice observed what appears to be negative
selection in two transfected cell lines initially
expressing high levels of transfected growth factor
receptor cdnas (egfr [63] and erb-b2 [64]).
the negative selection occurs under culture conditions which evidently are not favorable for
expression of the transfected gene, and is operative in several clonal cell lines produced by each
transfection. under culture conditions favorable

109

to high expression, however, we achieve stable
high levels of expression of the same two transfected growth factor receptors indefinitely [63,64].
in addition, we and others [57,65] have experienced difficulty in obtaining stable expression of
lacz in transfected cells utilizing this promotor.
thus it would seem that under some circumstances, a transfected cell population is able to
regulate production of a transfected gene in spite
of a constitutive promotor. since the growth
factor receptors described above are part of the
growth regulatory pathway, it is understandable
that certain culture conditions might result in
activation of the growth factor receptor itself or of
other effectors of the growth regulatory pathway,
with consequent regulatory mechanisms resulting
in loss of receptor expression. one would expect
that a transfection of a bacterial gene not involved
in growth regulation, such as lacz, would be a
benign modification that would not result in activation of a negative selection process. however,
this does not appear to be the case.
~-gal activity in one clone of mcf-7 cells
doubly transfected with  xxxg789xxx  and ~-gal, the
 xxxg1411xxx -4 clone, was initially high but rapidly
declined as the cells were passaged in culture.
this was due to loss of expression by individual
cells, not a gradual decline of expression by all
cells. figure 1 depicts low passage  xxxg1411xxx -4 cells,
with about 30% of cells exhibiting high levels of
[3-gal activity (figure 1a), and a culture about 12
passages later showing rare cells with high levels
of ~-gal activity (figure 1b). because individual
cells retained their expression, we tried to select
high-expressing cells using a fluorescent substrate
for ~-gal and fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(facs). in three successive sterile sorts separated by a minimal number of passages to allow for
expansion of the sorted population prior to resorting, we repeatedly selected cells which were
the most fluorescent (figure 2). before each sort,
we performed x-gal staining and estimated the
number of high-expressing cells in the culture.
although the cultures were enriched for high-expressing cells following each successive sort
(figure 2b, 2c), the sorted cells quickly lost lacz

untransfected mcf-7 cells (figure 2c), although
microscopically there are still high-expressing
cells (figure 1c).
because individual cells continued to express
high levels of ~-gal activity, we employed low
density plating of the  xxxg1411xxx -4 cell population from
the third sort to try to select clonal cell lines with
stable high expression. the cells were plated at
a density of 50 cells/150 mm dish and individual
colonies were picked to isolate clonal cell lines.
two clonal lines (clone 19 and clone 20) expressing high levels of [3-gal activity in over 90% of
cells were isolated. after approximately 6 weeks
in culture, both high-expressing clonal lines began
to have decreased numbers of high-expressing
cells, as had been noted for all three sorted
populations and the original  xxxg1411xxx -4 clonal population. at this point, the low density plating was
repeated with the  xxxg1411xxx -4 clone 20 cells, which
still exhibited 60-70% high-expressing cells.
subclonal cell lines in which 90% of the cells
expressed high levels of 13-gal activity were
established from colonies produced by this round
of low density plating. these subclones again
began to lose expression, as had all  xxxg1411xxx -4
derived populations. figure 1d shows one of
these  xxxg1411xxx -4 subclones, 20g, which expressed
high levels of ~-gal immediately after isolation
but began to lose expression several passages
later. thus, we were unable to establish a sorted
or clonal cell population of  xxxg1411xxx -4 cells with
stable expression of high 13-gal activity by either
facs or low density cloning.
at the time the original  xxxg1411xxx -4 cells were
transfected with lacz, an additional lacz transfected and  xxxg789xxx  transfected clonal cell line,
 xxxg1411xxx -8, was established (figure 1e) [20]. this
cell line has continued to stably express ~-gal
activity, but the level of i~-gal activity in this cell
line is not as high as we would wish for use in
metastasis detection. however, the existence of

111

this cell line which stably expresses [~-gal activity
over many passages provides evidence that  xxxg789xxx 
expression and lacz expression are not incompatible.
as mentioned, we had previously obtained a
clonal cell line of parental mcf-7 cells transfected with lacz, ml-20, which stably expresses
high levels of ~-gal [17,20]. this line was used
to generate the  xxxg786xxx  transfectants which stably
express lacz. to obtain doubly transfected cells
which stably express high levels of both  xxxg789xxx 
and lacz, we transfected the ml-20 cells with the
same expression vector for  xxxg789xxx  as had been
used in our original transfection of wild-type
mcf-7 cells [17]. clonal cell lines were isolated
which expressed high levels of  xxxg789xxx . one of
these clonal lines,  xxxg1411xxx -f, has been tested in
mice, and it is both tumorigenic and metastatic,
as the original transfectants had been (data not
shown). it also seems to stably express high
levels of lacz in prolonged culture (figure 1f).
the existence of this clonal cell line which stably
expresses both  xxxg789xxx  and lacz provides further
evidence that stable coexpression of these two
proteins is possible.
in order to elucidate the mechanism behind the
persistent loss of lacz expression exhibited by
 xxxg1411xxx -4 cells, we performed southern analysis of
high molecular weight dna from low and high
passages of the original  xxxg1411xxx -4 population, the
third of the three successive facs sorts, and
 xxxg1411xxx -4, clone 20, one of the clonal lines selected
for high lacz expression (figure 3). analysis
with bam hi, an enzyme that removes the lacz
insert from the expression vector, revealed that
the transfected dna was present at approximately
the same levels in all  xxxg1411xxx -4 derived cells, regardless of passage or selection for b-gal expression by facs or low-density cloning. the copy
number is comparable to that of ml-20 cells, the
parental mcf-7 cells which stably express lacz.
the lacz probe did not hybridize to dna from
wild-type mcf-7 cells. two different restriction
digests which linearized the pchci]-gal plasmid
used for transfection revealed about the same
copy number of intact plasmids in dna from the

figure 3. southern analysis of dna from lacz transfected
cells reveals comparable copy number of the transfected
gene in high and low expressing cells. high molecular
weight dna (25tag) from the indicated cell lines was
digested with barn hi. this enzyme cuts the lacz fragment
out of the expression plasmid so that the band obtained
corresponds to the 3.7 kb length of lacz sequences. the
random-primed 32p-labeled lacz probe did not hybridize to
dna obtained from parental mcf-7 cells. bands of
approximately equal intensity are obtained in dna from
 xxxg1411xxx -4 and ml-20 derived cells, indicating the presence of
comparable copy number of the expression plasmid in these
separately transfected cell lines. a somewhat fainter band
is seen in the lane containing dna from  xxxg1411xxx -8 cells,
which stably express lacz at lower levels than those
obtained with ml-20 ceils or individual high-expressing
 xxxg1411xxx -4 cells (figure 1). the intensity of the band obtained
with the barn hi digests was comparable to the intensity
obtained with 500 pg of similarly digested plasmid.
assuming that the aneuploid mcf-7 cells contain approximately 10 pg dna/cell,  xxxg1411xxx -4 and ml-20 ceils contain
about 16-17 copies of the expression plasmid. southern
blotting of xba i and hind iii digests of the same dnas
revealed bands of equal intensity in lanes containing dna
from  xxxg1411xxx -4 and ml-20 derived cells corresponding to the
molecular weight of the linearized expression plasmid,
indicating that the transfected plasmid had not undergone
gross rearrangement (data not shown). method: the
pchcl3gal lacz expression plasmid has been described elsewhere [20]. barn hi digests of high molecular weight
dna from the cell lines indicated were electrophoresed on
a 1% agarose gel, depurinated with 25 mm hci, and transferred to zetabind (cuno, inc., meriden, ct) nylon membrane using an alkaline transfer method [16]. equal loading
and completeness of digestion was verified by ethidium
bromide staining (data not shown), a 32p-labeled randomprimed probe comprised of the full-length lacz sequence
was hybridized to the membrane followed by autoradiography [16].

 xxxg1411xxx -4 and ml-20 cells, indicating that the plasmid had remained integrated in a tandem head to
tail arrangement (data not shown). thus, loss of
expression of [~-gal activity by m k l - 4 cells is not
due to loss or gross rearrangement of the transfected dna.
since loss of ~-gal activity in higher passage
m k l - 4 cells indicated that [3-gal protein expression was lost, we utilized northern analysis of
rna obtained from low and high passage m k l - 4
cells as well as the sorted and clonal populations
to determine whether the  xxxg1411xxx -4 cells expressed
lacz mrna. this analysis revealed easily detectable levels of lacz transcripts in the rna
obtained from ml-20, the mcf-7 clonal cell line
which stably expresses lacz. comparable levels
of lacz transcripts were detected in r n a from
m k l - f and m k l - k cells, two clonal  xxxg789xxx 
transfected cell lines which were derived from
ml-20 cells. of the  xxxg1411xxx -4 derived cells, only
m k l - 4 clone 20 cells expressed easily detectable
levels of lacz transcripts comparable to the levels
obtained from ml-20 cells (figure 4). thus, loss
of lacz transcription or accelerated m r n a degradation is responsible for the lack of [3-gal activity
in  xxxg1411xxx -4 cells.
the mechanism for shut-down of lacz expression despite retention of the transfected gene
driven by a strong constitutive promotor remains
unclear. the cmv promotor is constitutive for
many, but not all, cell types [66,67]. the cmvderived dna sequence contained within our plasmid (the human cmv major immediate early
gene from - 6 7 0 to +53 bp) contains various
elements which have been shown to interact with
known transcription factors [67-71]. these or
other undescribed elements could be responsible
for tissue-specific expression of genes driven by
the cmv promotor. however, since we have obtained stable high levels of expression of [~-gal in
ml-20 cells and prolonged high levels of expression of many other genes, including  xxxg789xxx  [63],
utilizing this promotor in mcf-7 cells, it would
seem that problems with lacz expression in mkl4 cells do not have to do with interactions of the
cmv promotor with transcription factors ex-

fgf-overexpressing cells as models of angiogenesis and metastasis

pressed by mcf-7 cells. in addition, sustained
high expression of the cmv-driven  xxxg789xxx  cdna
by  xxxg1411xxx -4 cells themselves argues against unique
transcription factors expressed by this particular
clone interacting negatively with the cmv promotor. alternatively, the  xxxg1411xxx -8 and ml-20
clonal cell lines which stably express lacz could
be atypical mcf-7 clones in that they might possess a particular characteristic lacked by other
mcf-7 cells which impinges positively on the
cmv promotor. the existence of stable high expression of  xxxg789xxx  in  xxxg1411xxx -4 cells themselves
also argues against this possibility, since if mkl4 cells lacked this positive factor, they would also
shut down  xxxg789xxx  expression. interactions of
mcf-7 cell specific transcription factors with
cryptic eukaryotic repressor elements encoded
within the bacterial lacz gene are probably also
ruled out because of the sustained levels of lacz
transcription in  xxxg1411xxx -8 cells and the ml-20 cells
and their progeny. it has been suggested that the
cmv promotor is proliferation dependent [65].
however, we note no differences in proliferation
rate between the cell lines which express high
levels of i]-gal activity and those which have lost
expression (data not shown). another explanation
is that  xxxg1411xxx -8 or ml-20 cells could lack a factor
which makes lacz expression a negative selection
factor for growth in  xxxg1411xxx -4 cells, again implying
that in  xxxg1411xxx -4 cells, lacz transfection is not a
benign modification. this possibility cannot be
ruled out at this time.
because the shut-down of lacz expression
affects individual cells expressing a particular
transfected gene, one could suspect that the cell is
using an active process to shut down transcription
of the transfected gene which takes longer in
some cells than in others. dna methylation has
been identified as one process by which transcription is down-regulated [72]. this process
would occur in individual cells of a population
and be transmitted to their progeny, leading to
progressive cell-specific loss of expression as we
see in  xxxg1411xxx -4 cells. unfortunately, this question
cannot be easily answered since the cmv promotor does not contain restriction sites for the

figure 4. 13-galactivity of lacz transfected cells correlates
with levels of transcripts for the transfected gene. transcripts detected by a random-primed lacz probe were present
in total rna from ml-20,  xxxg1411xxx -f, and  xxxg1411xxx -k cells,
clonal cell lines stably expressing f~-galactivity. however,
 xxxg1411xxx -4 cells sorted three successive times for g-gal expression showed no detectable transcripts 10 passages after
sorting. a clonal cell line (clone 20) of  xxxg1411xxx -4 cells
selected for high 13-gal expression had detectable lacz
transcripts, although at a reduced level when compared with
ml-20 cells, immediately after selection. however, this
clonal cell line also began to lose b-gal expression with
continued culture. the probe did not hybridize to rna
extracted from parental mcf-7 cells (data not shown).
method: total rna (30 tag) from the cell lines indicated
was electrophoresed in a 1.2% agarose gel containing 18%
formaldehyde and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. the
filter was first hybridized to a 32p-labeled riboprobe for
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphatedehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx ), used
as a loading control. after preliminary autoradiography, the
filter was hybridized to a 32p-labeled random-primed probe
for lacz described above, followed by autoradiography [16].

pairs of methylation sensitive and insensitive
isoschizomers usually used for this type of analysis. assuming that this or a similar mechanism is
operative in the  xxxg1411xxx -4 cells, the question still
remains as to why  xxxg1411xxx -8 or ml-20 cells do not
down-regulate expression of their lacz gene. the
difference in the case of the  xxxg1411xxx -8 or ml-20
cells may be the integration site of the transfected
dna. perhaps transcription in some areas of the
chromosomal dna is less easily regulated than
others, so that  xxxg1411xxx -8 or ml-20 cells are unable
to shut down their transcription of lacz because
chromosomal elements at the site of lacz integration prohibit negative regulation. this line of

114

sw mcleskey et al

reasoning again implies that lacz transfection is
not a benign modification.

conclusions
by transfection of angiogenic growth factors
( xxxg786xxx  or  xxxg789xxx ) into estrogen-dependent mcf7 breast carcinoma cells, we have developed laboratory tumor models of breast cancer progression
from estrogen-dependent, poorly tumorigenic, and
poorly metastatic to aggressively tumorigenic,
antiestrogen-resistant, and frequently metastatic.
the transfected cells are able to support the nontransfected parental ceils in tumors and metastases
under conditions where the parental cells would
not be tumorigenic. at this point, it is not clear
whether the phenotypic changes produced by the
transfection are due to autocrine effects on the
tumor cells themselves, paracrine effects on host
factors such as endothelial cells, or both. detection of metastasis has been facilitated by transfection of a marker gene, lacz, which enables detection of metastases in whole organs. treatment
of tumor-bearing mice with an angiogenesis inhibitor ( xxxd1330xxx ) did decrease tumor growth,
indicating that at least part of the phenotypic
transition produced by fgf transfection is due to
increased angiogenesis. however, pps, which
could be expected to abrogate both the autocrine
and paracrine effects of  xxxg789xxx , was more consistently effective than  xxxd1330xxx  in decreasing
growth of tumors produced by injection of fgftransfected cells.
thus, other autocrine or
paracrine factors besides angiogenesis may be
important in the tumorigenic phenotype of the
fgf-transfected cells. the extent of metastasis
for the  xxxg789xxx  transfectants has been correlated
with tumor size. treatment with the angiogenesis
inhibitor  xxxd1330xxx , or with pps, an agent which
abrogates all the effects of fgfs, did not decrease
metastasis beyond what would be expected by the
decrease in tumor size produced by these agents.
the study of metastasis has been somewhat hampered by the reduction in the proportion of cells
expressing the transfected lacz gene in  xxxg1411xxx -4

cells, a clonal  xxxg789xxx  transfected cell line. this
loss of expression is not due to loss of the
transfected dna, but is related to low levels of
mrna encoding lacz. however, a stable  xxxg789xxx 
and lacz expressing clonal cell line has been
established which will enable future study of
metastasis with this model.
