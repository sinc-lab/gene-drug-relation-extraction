introduction: a mechanism of anesthesia has recently been proposed which
predicts that coreleased neurotransmitters may modulate neurotransmitter receptors for which they are not the native agonist in a manner similar to anesthetics.
methods: we tested this prediction by applying acetylcholine to a nr1/ xxxg964xxx 
n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, glycine to a wild-type ␣1␤2 and anesthetic-resistant
␣1(s270i)␤2 ␥-amino-butyric acid (gaba) type a receptor, and gaba to a
homomeric ␣1 wild type and anesthetic-resistant ␣1 s267i  xxxg904xxx .
receptors were expressed in xenopus laevis oocytes and studied using twoelectrode voltage clamping.
results: we found inhibition of n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor function by acetylcholine, enhancement of  xxxg904xxx  function by gaba, and enhancement of
gaba type a receptor function by glycine. as expected of compounds with
anesthetic activity, gaba showed far less potentiation (enhancement) of the
function of the anesthetic-resistant s267i  xxxg904xxx  than that of the wild-type
receptor. glycine potentiated the function of wild-type gaba type a receptors but
inhibited the function of the anesthetic-resistant s270i gaba type a receptor.
conclusions: these results show that neurotransmitters that are coreleased onto
anesthetic-sensitive receptors may modulate the function of receptors for which
they are not the native agonist via an anesthetic-like mechanism. these findings
lend support to a recent theory of anesthetic action.

onsiderable evidence indicates that inhaled anesthetics act by inhibiting excitatory and potentiating
(enhancing) inhibitory currents through postsynaptic
ligand-gated ion channels (1–3). the mechanism by
which these actions are accomplished remains unknown (4). proposed mechanisms may be categorized
as direct or indirect, in that anesthetics might act either
by binding directly to well-defined sites on these
proteins, or indirectly by dissolving into (or adsorbing
onto) the bilayers of the postsynaptic membrane, and
altering various physical properties of the bilayer that
are coupled to protein activity.

an indirect mechanism of anesthesia has been
suggested (5) based on a hypothetical second mechanism of neurotransmitter action. it is proposed that, in
addition to rapid binding of a neurotransmitter to
extracellular sites on the receptor, inducing a conformational change that results in activation, the neurotransmitter also acts indirectly on its receptor by
adsorbing into the postsynaptic membrane and changing bilayer physical properties that influence the transitions and equilibria among receptor conformational
states. this additional membrane-mediated effect differs from agonist binding in that (1) it is less specific
with respect to molecular characteristics (2), the adsorption and desorption from the bilayer might be
quite slow, so that its influence on channel activity
could extend over long periods and (3) it may not
exhibit saturation until extremely high aqueous concentrations have been reached. many of the characteristics of desensitization and deactivation observed
electrophysiologically, both for inhibitory and excitatory channels, could be predicted by this mechanism,
including the continued dependence on neurotransmitter concentration as it is increased well above
binding saturation (5). in particular, it could account
both for the increased peak currents and the delayed
deactivation upon washout of neurotransmitter observed in inhibitory channels, as well as the decreased
vol. 105, no. 2, august 2007

peak currents and very rapid deactivation commonly
found in excitatory channels (6 –9).
in the present work, we explored an additional
neurobiological consequence of this theory. this proposed mechanism predicts that a second “noncognate” neurotransmitter, i.e., one that does not bind to
that receptor’s agonist sites, applied at concentrations
corresponding to estimated peak concentrations at the
postsynaptic membrane in the synaptic cleft, should
alter the activity of a particular receptor in a manner
similar to anesthetics. the release of a second neurotransmitter occurs physiologically: ␥-amino butyric
acid (gaba) and glycine are coreleased at some
synapses (10,11), as are acetylcholine (ach) and glutamate (12,13).
we hypothesized that the second, noncognate neurotransmitter to which anesthetic-sensitive receptors
are exposed during neurotransmitter corelease would
have anesthetic-like effects on the receptor bound by
the native neurotransmitter. we tested this on recombinant receptors, using inhibitory ␣1 glycine and ␣1␤2
gaba type a (gabaa) receptors, and the excitatory
nr1/ xxxg964xxx  n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor
as model systems. these receptors are representative
of cys-loop and  xxxg981xxx  families, which are
postulated to mediate the actions of inhaled anesthetics. we studied these particular receptor subtypes
because they have been widely studied in investigations of inhaled anesthetic mechanisms (14 –16). to
confirm anesthetic-like modulation of glycine and
gabaa receptors, we also applied noncognate neurotransmitters to anesthetic-resistant mutant glycine and
gabaa receptors.

materials and methods
methods for study of glycine receptors
studies using frogs oocytes were approved by the
committee on animal research at the university of
california, san francisco. the  xxxg904xxx 
clones were a gift of professor r. a. harris (university of texas, austin). stage v and vi xenopus laevis
oocytes were defolliculated by gentle rotation in 500
u/ml collagenase type 1 (worthingtom biochemical corporation, lakewood, nj) for 1 h at room
temperature. homomeric human ␣1 glycine receptors subcloned into pbk-cmv were expressed by
microinjection of 0.25–1 ng cdna into x. laevis
oocytes. oocytes were maintained at 18°c in modified barth’s solution (88 mm nacl, 1 mm kcl, 2.4
mm nahco3, 20 mm hepes, 0.82 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 0.33
mm ca(no3)2, 0.41 mm cacl2, with 5 mm sodium
pyruvate, 50 ␮g/ml  xxxd2193xxx , 50 u/ml penicillin, and 50 ␮g/ml streptomycin, filtered and adjusted to ph ⫽ 7.4). all reagents were purchased
from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo). the purity of
the neurotransmitters was as follows: glycine
(99⫹%), gaba (99%), glutamate (99%), ach (99%).
vol. 105, no. 2, august 2007

one to 4 days after injection, two-electrode voltage
clamping was performed on oocytes (geneclamp
500b; molecular devices, axon instruments, foster
city, ca). experiments were performed using frog
ringer’s solution as perfusate (115 mm nacl, 2.5 mm
kcl, 1.8 mm cacl2, 10 mm hepes, filtered and
adjusted to ph 7.4). an automated perfusion system
delivered solutions (automate valvebank perfusion
system, san francisco, ca). recordings were obtained
in a 250-␮l recording chamber at flow rates of 2–3
ml/min. signals were filtered using a 4-pole low-pass
bessel filter set at a 50 –100 hz cutoff before sampling
at 100 –1000 hz. water-injected and uninjected oocytes
served as controls.
oocytes were voltage clamped at ⫺80 mv. stable
inward currents in response to glycine was verified by
application of glycine for 20 s followed by a 5– 6 min
washout, which was repeated three times. to control
for osmolarity, sucrose was added to frog ringer’s
solution when needed. osmolarity was checked using
a vapor pressure osmometer (vapro 5520 from wescor inc., logan, ut). gaba was applied to oocytes for
100 s, followed by coapplication of glycine with gaba
for 20 s. return to baseline response to agonist was
confirmed. potentiation of currents in homomeric ␣1
wild type and anesthetic resistant ␣1s267i mutant
glycine receptors was studied using an ec5 concentration of agonist after washin of 5 mm gaba.

methods for study of gabaa and nmda receptors

the procedure for expressing ␣1␤2 gabaa and
nr1/ xxxg964xxx  nmda receptors in x. laevis oocytes and
studying them using two-electrode voltage clamping
has been described elsewhere (17). we modified this
protocol by washing in glycine and ach for 100 s to
evaluate their modulatory effects on gabaa and
nmda receptors, respectively, and comparing these
currents to isosmotic sucrose controls. potentiation of
currents in ␣1␤2 wild type and anesthetic-resistant
␣1(s270i)␤2 mutant gabaa receptors was studied
using an ec20 concentration of agonist after washin of
5 mm glycine.
data were analyzed by analyses of variance or by
nonlinear regression to a hill equation. p ⬍ 0.05 was
considered significant.

discussion
anesthetic-like modulation of receptors by
coreleased neurotransmitters
we found that preexposure of an nmda receptor
to ach inhibited cation currents evoked by glutamate application; that preexposure of a gabaa
receptor to glycine enhanced chloride currents
evoked by subsaturating gaba application; that
preexposure of a  xxxg904xxx  to gaba enhanced chloride currents evoked by subsaturating
glycine application. these are anesthetic-like effects.
these findings suggest that noncognate neurotransmitters might affect synaptic events during neurotransmitter corelease. if so, this mechanism would
especially favor enhancement of  xxxg904xxx 
currents, since their function is potentiated more
and at lower concentrations of the coreleased neurotransmitter than that of gabaa receptors. this
possibly accounts for why gaba and glycine corelease is common in the hindbrain (11) and spinal
cord (10), which are rich in glycinergic synapses.
the extent to which neurotransmitter corelease
might affect synaptic function in vivo depends on
neurotransmitter concentrations in synapses. what are
likely peak synaptic neurotransmitter concentrations?
neurotransmitter concentration in synaptic vesicles is
high; for example, the serotonin concentration in
vesicles is approximately 270 mm (19), ach concentration in vesicles is estimated to be 250 mm (5), and
vesicular concentrations of other neurotransmitters
may be similar to these. as an order-of-magnitude
estimate, the volume of a synaptic cleft of thickness 20
nm and diameter 200 nm is only roughly an order of
magnitude more than that of neurotransmitter
vesicles, so even if the neurotransmitter were uniformly distributed in the synapse, it would only result

membrane. although this is only a rough estimate, it
is thus quite plausible that neurotransmitters could
achieve the millimolar concentrations of noncognate
neurotransmitter, which we found modulates glycine,
gabaa, and nmda receptor function. although the
aqueous concentration of neurotransmitter in the synapse decreases rapidly, it is the rates at which neurotransmitter adsorbs and desorbs from the membrane
that will determine the extent to which this mechanisms operates in vivo. these rates are unknown, even
for artificial lipid bilayers.
although they are preferentially localized to the
inner leaflet, approximately 20% of the lipids of synaptic membranes are anionic, primarily containing
phosphatidylserine head groups, which can interact
strongly with the gaba zwitterion. the specific binding constant of gaba to phophatidylserine head
groups has been measured to be 5 ⫻ 10⫺3 m (20),
which implies that half of all phosphatidylserine head
groups have gaba bound when the aqueous gaba
concentration is 200 ␮m: approximately, the concentration at which  xxxg904xxx  function was potentiated by gaba in our studies.

alternative interpretations of these results

figure 4. study of anesthetic-resistant mutant ␥-amino butyric acid type a (gabaa) and glycine receptors confirms
the anesthetic effect of noncognate neurotransmitters. data
are expressed as mean ⫾ se. a, 5 mm gaba produces no
significant difference in current, expressed as a percent of
the maximal current produced by a saturating concentration
of glycine, between wild-type and anesthetic-resistant mutant homomeric ␣1 s267i glycine receptors (first two bars on
graph; n ⫽ 5 oocytes). there is reduced potentiation (enhancement) of glycinergic currents in response to an ec5
concentration of glycine after washin of 5 mm gaba for the
mutant (n ⫽ 6 oocytes) compared with that for the wild-type
(n ⫽ 5 oocytes) receptor, consistent with an anesthetic-like
mechanism (last two bars on graph). b, 5 mm glycine
produces no significant difference in current (expressed as a
percent of the maximal current) between wild-type and
anesthetic-resistant mutant ␣1 s270i containing ␣1␤2 gabaa
receptors (first two bars on graph; n ⫽ 4 oocytes). there is
inhibition of gabaergic currents in response to an ec20
concentration of gaba after washin of 5 mm glycine for the
mutant receptor (n ⫽ 6 oocytes) and potentiation for the
wild-type (n ⫽ 6 oocytes) receptor, consistent with an
anesthetic-like mechanism (last two bars on graph).

modulation of receptors by coreleased neurotransmitters

our findings were predicted by an indirect, bilayermediated theory of anesthetic action. however, other
explanations for our results are possible. for example,
noncognate neurotransmitters may bind directly to
sites on the receptors to produce anesthetic-like modulation of channel function. however, putative inhaled
anesthetic binding sites on gabaa and glycine receptors (21) have been modeled extensively, and have
never been proposed to be low affinity gaba and
glycine binding sites; nor has the putative binding site
on the nmda receptor (22) been suggested to be a low
affinity binding site for ach. nonetheless, our data
cannot exclude binding to an allosteric site on the
receptor.
the noncognate neurotransmitters possibly act as
agonists, binding to the canonical agonist site to
produce the anesthetic-like effects we observed. two
lines of evidence, presented in figures 2 and 4, show
that this is not the case. in figure 2, the magnitude of
the effects of the noncognate neurotransmitters is
shown. these effects are not consistent with an agonist
action of the noncognate neurotransmitter. for example, 1 mm gaba potentiated  xxxg904xxx 
function (fig. 2), but did not evoke currents by itself.
given the sensitivity with which currents are measured, this places an upper bound of at most a 1%
increase in current from 1 mm gaba when added to
250 ␮m glycine. this is smaller than the 13% difference in currents actually observed. similar calculations show that 10 mm glycine should increase
gabaa receptor currents evoked by 100 ␮m gaba
by only approximately 1% rather than the 22% actually observed.
anesthesia & analgesia

studies on anesthetic-resistant mutant receptors
support this conclusion. figure 4 shows that 5 mm
glycine has the same agonist effect on wild-type and
anesthetic-resistant mutant gabaa receptors. however, glycine potentiated the function of wild-type
gabaa receptors while inhibiting the function of
mutant gabaa receptors. thus, potentiation of
gabaa receptor function by glycine is mechanistically similar to that of inhaled anesthetics, not that of
agonists. likewise, 5 mm gaba had the same agonist
effect on wild-type and anesthetic-resistant mutant
glycine receptors, but potentiation of receptor function
was much less in the mutant compared with that in
the wild-type receptor, consistent with an anestheticlike modulation of channel function, not an agonist
effect.

neurotransmitters may exert a selective pressure for the
response to anesthetics
our findings together with the theory that motivated our experiments may help explain why animals
evolved the capacity to be anesthetized. the response
to the wide range of anesthetic compounds by animals
in different phyla (23–25) suggests a common origin of
the anesthetic site of action at least several hundred
million years ago. in the absence of natural selection,
the capacity to respond to anesthetics should have
diminished or disappeared over this span of time as a
result of spontaneous mutation (26); hence, natural
selection likely acts to conserve the response to anesthetics. what is the source of the selective pressure? if
neurotransmitters affect bilayer properties, and their
receptors are adapted to these changes and use them
to regulate their conformational equilibrium, and if
anesthetics mimic this effect, then neurotransmitters
will exert a selective pressure for receptors, which
respond to anesthetics. that is, the “endogenous anesthetics” in animals would be neurotransmitters, the
survival advantage conferred by their membranemediated fine-tuning of the time-dependence of ion
currents explaining the well-known selection pressure
for anesthetic sensitivity (26).
continuous selection for ligand-gated ion channels, which are adapted to the indirect effects of
their native neurotransmitters on bilayer properties,
may also explain why synaptic transmission, which
is mediated by ion channels exposed to neurotransmitters, is more sensitive to inhaled anesthetic action than is axonal conduction, which is mediated
by channels that are not exposed to neurotransmitters (27). our hypothesis may also explain why
extrasynaptic receptors, which are exposed to, and
perhaps adapted to, the indirect, bilayer-mediated
effects of lower concentrations of neurotransmitter
which spill out of the synapse, would therefore
respond to lower concentrations of inhaled anesthetics than synaptic receptors (28).
