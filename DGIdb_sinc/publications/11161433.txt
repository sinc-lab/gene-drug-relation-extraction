introduction
the association between the balance of th1/th2 cell
responses and  xxxg570xxx  expression in cd4 ⴙ t cells
was investigated in a murine model implanted with
highly metastatic b16f10 melanoma cells (b16f10
mice). when 2 ⴛ 10 5 cells/mouse of b16f10 cells were
inoculated into c57bl/6 mice, th2 cell responses and
pulmonary metastasis were increased. in addition,
corticosterone levels in splenic tissue or serum and
 xxxg570xxx  mrna expression (mrna encoding cholesterol side-chain cleavage p450 enzyme) in cd4 ⴙ t cells
were increased in these mice. when the anti-corticosterone drug  xxxd147xxx  ( xxxg570xxx  inhibitor)
was administered to b16f10 mice, corticosterone levels in splenic tissue or serum and  xxxg570xxx  mrna
expression were decreased at 14 days after tumor inoculation. in addition, th1 cell responses were restored and pulmonary metastasis was reduced by  xxxd147xxx . these results indicated that the
breakdown of th cell responses and increase of pulmonary metastasis were due to an increase in steroidogenic  xxxg570xxx  mrna expression in cd4 ⴙ t cells.
moreover, it was suggested that promotion of
 xxxg570xxx  mrna expression in th2 cells was partially
involved due to an increase in level of corticosterone
in splenic tissue and the breakdown of th cell responses locally in the splenic tissue, which then affected the maintenance of th2 cell functions in the
microenvironment of tumor-bearing mice. © 2000

mosmann et al. reported that t cells could be divided
into two subpopulations, th1 2 and th2 cells, according
to differences in cytokine production (1). recent studies
have indicated that native t cells initially differentiate
into th0 cells, then differentiate into either th1 or th2
cells (2). ifn-␥, which is produced by th1 cells, induces
th1 cell differentiation and suppresses th2 cell responses (3). on the other hand, il-4 and il-10, which
are produced by th2 cells, have been shown to regulate
the differentiation of th0 cells to th2 cells and to
inhibit the function of th1 cells (4, 5). thus, these
reports suggested that the control of immune response
constructed by th1 and th2 cytokines is carried out
ultimately via cytokines. it has been reported that th
cell responses tend toward th2 dominance due to enhancement of il-4 and il-10 mrna expression and
production of these cytokines in the tumor-bearing
state (6 – 8). we also recently reported that th cell
responses in meth-a tumor-bearing mice tend toward
th2 dominance, and the presence of both cytokines,
il-12 from macrophages and ifn-␥ from cd4 ⫹ t cells,
is necessary for the recovery from a th2-dominant
state to a th1-dominant state (9). the breakdown of th
cell responses is considered to be closely related to
tumor growth, metastasis, and survival rate in the
tumor-bearing state.
glucocorticoid (gc) is known to show various immunomodulatory activities. it has been reported that synthetic gc dexamethasone induces th2 cytokine pro-

duction in vitro and suppresses the production of th1
cytokines such as ifn-␥ and tnf-␣, and typical gc
corticosterone suppresses il-2 production, but induces
il-4 production (10 –13). these reports suggested that
although gc strongly suppresses th1 responses, th2
responses may be enhanced rather than suppressed. it
has already been clarified that serum corticosterone
levels increase in mice inoculated with el-4 and colon
26 tumors (14, 15). these reports also suggested that
the enhancement of steroidogenesis in tumor-bearing
mice suppresses th1 cell responses and further induces th2 cell responses.
therefore, we investigated the association between
steroidogenesis and steroidogenic enzyme ( xxxg570xxx )
expression in cd4 ⫹ t cells and th cell responses, using
b16f10 mice.

the reagents were as follows:  xxxd147xxx 
(sigma), cmc (wako), rpmi 1640 medium (nissui
seiyaku), fbs (jrh biosciences), ifn-␥ and il-4
elisa kit (endogen), seakem  xxxg889xxx  agarose and
nusieve  xxxg889xxx  agarose (fmc bioproducts), trizol

implantation of b16f10 cells to c57bl/6 mice
b16f10 cells, a highly metastatic strain of b16 melanoma cells, syngeneic to c57bl/6 mice, were grown in
vitro with rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated fbs, antibiotics, and 2 mm l-glutamine. cells in a log-growth phase were detached
from tissue culture flasks using a mixture of 0.25%
trypsin and 1 mm edta. the cells were washed and
then 1 ⫻ 10 6 cells/ml of b16f10 cells were suspended
in pbs just before implantation, and 2 ⫻ 10 5 cells/
mouse of cultured b16f10 cells were inoculated iv into
c57/bl6 mice. after tumor inoculation, lung tissues
were removed from these mice and fixed in a 10%
formaldehyde solution. the number of metastatic colonies in lungs was counted under a dissecting microscope, as described previously (7).

 xxxd147xxx 
in this experiment,  xxxd147xxx , an inhibition of  xxxg570xxx , was dissolved in 0.5% cmc at a
concentration of 1 mg/ml just before experimental use.
 xxxd147xxx  at a dose of 10 mg/kg was administered sc to c57bl/6 mice twice a day, from immediately after tumor inoculation for 14 days. as a control,
cmc was administered.
measurement of cytokine production
splenocytes were prepared from c57bl/6 mice at 3,
7, 10, and 14 days after tumor inoculation. to prepare
cd4 ⫹ t cells, splenocytes were passed through cd4 ⫹ t
cell subset columns (cytovax biotechnologies). the
cd4 ⫹ t cells were suspended with rpmi 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fbs, 2
mm glutamine, 100 u/ml penicillin, and 100 ␮g/ml
streptomycin. then, 2 ⫻ 10 6 cells/ml of these cells were
stimulated with  xxxd2676xxx  mab at a concentration of
2.5 ␮g/ml in a 96-well tissue culture plate (corning)
and incubated for 48 h at 37°c in 5% co 2. the culture
fluid was stored at ⫺80°c until use for elisa; the
amounts of ifn-␥ and il-4 were measured by an
elisa kit (7).
determination of mouse il-12 p40 mrna expression
in  xxxg1206xxx  ⫹ cells by rt-pcr
the  xxxg1206xxx  ⫹ cells of splenocytes (5 mice pooled) were
obtained from normal or b16f10 mice at 3, 7, 10, and
14 days after tumor inoculation. to collect  xxxg1206xxx  ⫹
cells of splenocytes, a magnetic cell-sorting system
(macs) was used. briefly, splenocytes were mixed
with magnetic beads-conjugated anti-mouse  xxxg1206xxx  ⫹
antibody and incubated at 4°c for 15 min. these
splenocytes were washed and suspended in cell separation buffer. the cell separation columns were set to
the magnet for the midi macs (miltenyi biotec), and
cell suspensions were applied to the column. after
washing the column with cell separation buffer to elute
the nonattached cells completely, attached cells were
eluted. then, these  xxxg1206xxx  ⫹ cells were stored at ⫺80°c
until use for total rna preparation. the total rna was
isolated from  xxxg1206xxx  ⫹ cells by trizol reagent.
determination of  xxxg570xxx  mrna expression in
cd4 ⫹ t cells by rt-pcr
to determine  xxxg570xxx  mrna expression, the
splenocytes (4 –5 mice pooled) were passed through a
cd4 ⫹ t cell subset column to separate cd4 ⫹ t cells.
the eluted cells were used for total rna preparation.
the total rna was isolated from cd4 ⫹ t cells by
trizol reagent.

determination of corticosterone levels
serum was collected and stored at ⫺80°c before
assay. to determine corticosterone in splenic tissue,
these splenic tissues in cold pbs (1 ml) were homogenized by a power homogenizer and centrifuged for 15
min at 12,000g, 4°c. the supernatants were collected
and then stored at ⫺80°c before assay. corticosterone
was measured using a corticosterone [ 125i] radioimmunoassay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

below 0.05 were considered significant.
results
relationship between corticosterone levels in both
serum and splenic tissue, and th cell responses
in b16f10 mice
to determine the daily changes in th cell responses
in tumor-bearing mice, b16f10 tumor cell suspension
was inoculated iv into c57bl/6 mice (b16f10 mice).
ifn-␥ production (th1 cytokine) and il-4 production
(th2 cytokine) from cd4 ⫹ t cells, stimulated with anticd3 mab (2.5 ␮g/ml) in vitro, were measured at 3, 7,
10, and 14 days after tumor inoculation. as shown in
fig. 1a, ifn-␥ production was significantly decreased
in a time-dependent manner after tumor inoculation.
as shown in fig. 1b, il-4 production was increased at
7, 10, and 14 days, in contrast to ifn-␥ production.
this result indicated that th cell responses in b16f10
mice tend toward th2 dominance.
on the other hand, to determine the relationship
between th cell responses and steroidogenesis, we
measured the corticosterone levels in serum and
splenic tissue at the various times after tumor inoculation. as shown in fig. 2a, the serum corticosterone
levels from b16f10 mice consecutively increased with
time after tumor inoculation. moreover, the corticosterone levels in splenic tissue from b16f10 mice were
also increased with time after tumor inoculation, similar to serum corticosterone levels (fig. 2b). these results suggested that the increases in level of corticosterone in serum and splenic tissue and the increase in
th2 responses are closely related in b16f10 mice.
 xxxg570xxx  mrna expression in cd4 ⫹ t cells from
b16f10 mice
cholesterol side-chain cleavage p450 ( xxxg570xxx ) enzyme catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step in the
synthesis of steroid hormones.  xxxg570xxx  mrna is
found only in tissues with steroidogenic potential and
it was the determining factor in steroid production
(17). the analysis of its expression is a definitive
marker for the potential for corticosterone synthesis
(18). to determine daily changes in  xxxg570xxx  mrna
expression in cd4 ⫹ t cells from b16f10 mice, b16f10
tumor cell suspension (2 ⫻ 10 5 cells) was inoculated iv
into c57bl/6 mice. at 3, 7, 10, and 14 days after tumor
inoculation,  xxxg570xxx  mrna expression in cd4 ⫹ t

10, and 14 days after tumor inoculation, il-12 p40
mrna expression in  xxxg1206xxx  ⫹ cells was determined
by rt-pcr. as shown in fig. 4, the il-12 p40 mrna
expression was consecutively decreased in splenic
 xxxg1206xxx  ⫹ cells derived from b16f10 mice, compared
to that of normal mice. these results suggested that
the increases in level of corticosterone and the decrease in il-12 p40 mrna expression are closely
related in b16f10 mice.

to determine the effects of  xxxd147xxx  on

b16f10 mice, 10 mg/kg of  xxxd147xxx  was administered sc twice a day from immediately after tumor inoculation. then, the  xxxg570xxx  mrna expression in cd4 ⫹ t cells was examined by rt-pcr at 14
days after tumor inoculation. as shown in fig. 7, the
results showed that  xxxd147xxx  reduces the
 xxxg570xxx  mrna expression in cd4 ⫹ t cells (lines 2
and 3). this result suggested that  xxxd147xxx 
suppresses the th2 dominance seen in the tumor-bearing state by reducing  xxxg570xxx  mrna expression in
cd4 ⫹ t cells.

 xxxd147xxx  suppresses steroidogenesis by

cell responses in b16f10 mice, 10 mg/kg of  xxxd147xxx  was administered sc twice a day from immediately after tumor inoculation, and th cell responses
were examined at 14 days after tumor inoculation (fig.

decreased il-4 production, compared to nontreated
b16f10 mice. this result clearly indicated that  xxxd147xxx  restores the breakdown of th1 cell responses in b16f10 mice. on the other hand, 14 days
after tumor inoculation, the corticosterone levels in
both serum and splenic tissue were found to be decreased by administration of  xxxd147xxx  (fig.

showed that  xxxd147xxx  suppressed metastasis in the lungs at a rate of 76%. on the other hand,
 xxxd147xxx  did not have an effect on the proliferation of b16f10 tumor cells in vitro (table 1).
 xxxd147xxx  was assumed to have no direct
suppressive effect on b16f10 tumor cell proliferation
but to consequently suppress pulmonary metastasis by
improving th cell responses from th2 dominance to
th1 dominance through suppression of corticosterone
levels.

therefore investigated the effects of steroidogenesis on

observed that corticosterone levels in both splenic tissue and serum were increased, steroidogenic  xxxg570xxx

oka et al.

b16f10 mice may have been induced not only by serum
corticosterone but also by corticosterone produced from
cd4 ⫹ t cells that tend toward th2 dominance. moreover, it was suggested that th1 and th2 cell responses
are not tumor ag specific and are merely polyclonal t
cell correlations to steriod production and/or inhibition.
on the other hand, it has been reported that th2 cell
responses are strongly induced in the presence of il-4
and synthetic gc dexamethasone (19). such reports
indicated that steroidogenesis in splenic tissue from a
tumor-bearing host may also be involved in the induction of th2 cell responses locally, and the maintenance
of th2 cell function. that is, in a tumor-bearing host,
the microenvironment as a site of immune responses is
broken down by endogenous steroidogenesis and various cytokines. with regard to homeostasis, results in a
state of th2 dominance, il-4 or il-10 is produced from
th2 cells, and a th2 dominant cycle is invoked.
it is considered that the breakage of th1/th2 cell
responses is a crucial factor in a tumor-bearing host.
takeuchi et al. reported the overexpression of il-4 and
il-10 mrna in splenocytes from mice bearing renal
cell carcinoma, while the administration of anti-mouse
il-4 mab to the above mice have resulted in reduced
tumor size and prolonged the survival rate of the host
(6). kobayashi et al. reported enhancement of il-4 and
il-10 production from the th2 cells of mice implanted
with high metastatic b 16, and suppression of pulmonary metastasis by administration of anti-mouse il-4
mab to the above mice (7). hu et al. also reported that
t cells with tumor-specific type 1 cytokine responses
suppressed pulmonary metastasis (20). from these reports, it was considered important in immunotherapy
to release th1 cells from the th2-dominant state in a
tumor-bearing host. in this paper, it was indicated that
suppression of corticosterone levels by  xxxg570xxx  inhibitor was restored from th2 to th1 dominance in
b16f10 mice, resulting in suppression of pulmonary
metastasis. however, nishimura et al. reported that
both th1 cells and th2 cells eradicated tumors, although th1 cells exhibited stronger cytotoxicity than
th2 cells (21). it was reported that th2 cytokines
showed anti-tumor activities in vivo (22). moreover,
hung et al. also reported that synergistical cooperation
of th1 and th2 cell responses is required for maximal
systemic anti-tumor immunity (23). it was estimated
that the balance of th1/th2 cell responses is controlled
with complicated mechanisms, it difficult to conclude
which cell types are the most effective for tumor
growth, metastasis, and survival rate of tumor-bearing
host.
it was recently reported that the balance of th1/th2
cell responses was modulated by il-12 produced from
antigen-presenting cells. the immunomodulatory activity of il-12 has been intensively studied. il-12 is a
cytokine that activates nk cells, nkt cells, or th1
cells, increases ifn-␥ production, and induces th1-

dominant immune responses by suppressing il-4 production from th2 cells (24 –28). from these reports, it
was considered that il-12 from these cells plays an
important role in regulation of th1/th2 cell responses.
in this paper, we demonstrated that il-12 p40 mrna
expression was decreased in  xxxg1206xxx  ⫹ cells of splenocytes derived from b16f10 mice. these phenomena
were suppressed by the administration of  xxxd147xxx . these results suggested that il-12 production
from  xxxg1206xxx  ⫹ cells, that is antigen-presenting cells,
may be suppressed by increases of corticosterone in
tumor-bearing mice. it was supported by visser et al.
that il-12 production and il-12 p40 mrna expression
were suppressed by gc (29). moreover, franchimont et
al. reported that gc selectively inhibits il-12-induced
stat 4 phosphorylation in t lymphocytes and then inhibits th1 cell responses (30). from this knowledge,
the activities of gc are of interest in the regulation of
th1/th2 cell responses by il-12. on the other hand,
the differentiation of th0 cells to th1 cells is affected
by il-12 and ifn-␥ (31). it has been reported that th2
cells are restored to th0 cells in the presence of il-12,
ifn-␥, and anti-il-4 antibody (32). in a tumor-bearing
host, the microenvironment as a site of immune responses is thought to be broken down by the effect of
endogenous corticosterone, and differentiation to th1
cells by il-12 alone is difficult. lin et al. recently reported a suppressive effect of  xxxg570xxx  mrna expression in rat leydig cells as a function of the ifn-␥ in the
endocrine system (33). we also clarified in the present
study that the  xxxg570xxx  enzyme inhibitor  xxxd147xxx  restores th1 cell responses in tumor-bearing
hosts. thus, it is possible in the regulation of th cell
responses that the suppression of  xxxg570xxx  in th2
cells due to ifn-␥ or  xxxd147xxx  blocks steroidogenesis in th2 cells, improves the microenvironment
in the tumor-bearing host, and aids th1 cell differentiation due to il-12.
the increase in endogenous corticosterone, seen in
b16f10 mice, is partially based on the induction of
 xxxg570xxx  mrna expression in th2 cells and is involved in the maintenance of th2 dominance in the
splenic tissue locally. moreover, to restore th cell responses in the tumor-bearing condition from th2 dominance to th1 dominance, a decrease in  xxxg570xxx 
mrna expression and a decrease in steroidogenesis by
 xxxd147xxx  are essential. in this study, we
clarified the importance of  xxxg570xxx  in the initial
mechanism that induces th2 dominance and maintains the function, and the importance of  xxxg570xxx 
mrna expression in the mechanism by which th cell
responses are restored from th2 to th1 dominance.
