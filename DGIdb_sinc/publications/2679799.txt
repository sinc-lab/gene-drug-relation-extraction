pluripotent pi9 embryonal carcinoma cell cultures can be induced to differentiate into neurons and glial cells by
the addition of
m  xxxd3417xxx . during early neural differentiation, a bundle of colchicine-stable, acetylated
microtubules is formed. this acetylated microtubule array apparently extends to form neurites during neurogenesis.
in this paper, we analyze changes in vimentin and  xxxg1400xxx  distributions during neural differentiation with respect to
the changes in the acetylated microtubule array. during a brief period early in differentiation, indirect immunofluorescence
staining shows the colocalization of colchicine-stable acetylated microtubules, vimentin, and  xxxg1400xxx . using acrylamide
to disrupt the organization of vimentin intermediate filaments and  xxxd2041xxx  to disrupt the binding of  xxxg1400xxx  to
microtubules, we show that acetylated microtubules,  xxxg1400xxx , and vimentin intermediate filaments are arranged in an
interdependent cytoskeletal array. we suggest this array may serve to stabilize processes in neural stem cells, before
the final decision to differentiate into neurons or glia is made.

introduction
the elongated processes of neural cells contain mts
aligned parallel to the long axis of the process. up to 60%
of these mts resist depolymerization by cold or colchicine
and can be described as "stable mts" (sahenk and brady
1987; brady et al. 1984; black and greene 1982). these mts
contain acetylated a-tubulin, a posttranslational modification that is associated with stable mt arrays (piperno et al.
1987; cambray-deakin and burgoyne 1987; sale et al. 1988).
in a previous paper (falconer et al. 1989), we documented
the induction of this stable, acetylated mt array during
neuronal differentiation in pluripotent p19 ec cell cultures

using changes in the acetylated mt array, we classified
neuronal differentiation into three stages. in the first stage,
which occurs before extension of processes is seen, there is
formation of a stable, acetylated mt bundle. no maps have
been detected in association with this mt bundle. in the
second stage, extension of neurites occurs and  xxxg1400xxx  now
colocalizes with stable mt arrays. in the third stage, further
neurite specialization is seen, including onset of neurofilament, map lb, and tau staining.
in this paper we examine the interactions between stable
mts and ifs. these investigations focus on vimentin, which
is the first if protein found during differentiation in ec cells
(paulin et al. 1982) and is also the first if protein seen during
neuronal differentiation in embryos (reviewed by fedoroff
et al., 1982-1983).
our results show that vimentin ifs are unlikely to play
a role in stabilizing the early, stage 1 mt bundle. however,
during stage 2, vimentin ifs are part of a cytoskeletal
complex present in the newly extending neural process. by
using two cytoskeletal disrupting agents, acrylamide, which

538

biochem. cell biol. vol. 67, 1989

acts to disrupt if organization (eckert 1985; sager 1989),
and  xxxd2041xxx , which binds to maps resulting in mt
depolymerization (stearns and tew 1988), we demonstrate
that acetylated mts,  xxxg1400xxx , and vimentin ifs are present
as an interdependent complex which can serve t o stabilize
a newly extended process in a cell. we suggest this may occur
in cells committed t o the neural pathway but whose final
differentiation into either neurons or glial cells is not yet
specified.

materials and methods
cell cultures
the p19 mouse ec cell line (mcburney and rogers 1982) was
maintained at 337°c and 5% c q in a-mem@ow laboratories,
mississauga, ont.), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fbs
(fiow labs), and passaged every2 days using 0.25% trypsin (row
labs) and 1 m m edta (sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo) in
calcium- and magnesium-free pbs. for ra (sigma) induced
neuronal differentiation, cells were seeded on coverslips, usualiy
1 x 10' ceils per coverslip, in a 35-mm tissue cutture dish in
a-mem plus 10% fbs. aftm 24 h, the medium was replaced with
a-mem plus i % fbs, and 1w6m iza was added to induce
neuronal differentiation. a lol2 m stock solution of ra was
prepared in ethanol, stored at - bo°c, and diluted to lo-' m in
medium. appropriate amounts were added to the cultures for a
final concentration of l w 6 m ra.
experiments using cytoskeleton disrupting agents were performed
on stage 1 (24 h after addition ofra), stage 2 (48 h after addition
of ra),and stage 3 (72 h after addition of ra) cells. grown on
coverslips. colchicine (sigma) was made up as a stock solution
o f 1 mg/ml in sterile distilied water, stored at -8o0c, and used
at a final dilution of 1 pg/ml in culture medium for 45 min.
 xxxd2041xxx  (a gift from mark stearns) was freshly prepared for
each experiment as a 10 mm stock solution in dmso and used
at a final dilution of 150 pm for 1 h. acrylamide (bio-rad
laboratories, richmond, ca) was freshly made up as a 4 m stock
solution in sterile distilled water and used at a final dilution in
culture medium of 4 mm for 5 h. when both acrylamide and colchicine were used, 1 pg/ml colchicine was added after 4 h and
15 min of exposure to 4 mm acrylamide, and the cells were fixed
45 rnin later.
immunofluorescence techniques
cells attached to coverslips were briefly washed in calcium- and
magnesium-free pbs and then simultaneous~yfixed and extracted
in 3.7% paraformaldehyde plus 0.25% gtutaraldehyde (v/v) in
pem buffer (80 mm pipes, 5 m m egta, 1 m m mgcl,, and
1 % triton x-$00(all purchased from sigma), ph 6.8) for 5 rnin,
then rinsed 3 x 3 min in pbs, postfixed for 3 min ir! ice-cold 95%
ethanol, followed by 3 x 3 min rinses in pbs. double immunofluorescence staining was done by simultaneous incubation in two
primary antibodies for 45 min at room temperature, followed by
3 x 3 min pbs rinses, and then simultaneous incubation with the
two indicated secondary antibodies for 45 min at room
temperature. appropriate controls were done to insure that crossreaction between secondary antibodies did not occur. following
3 x 3 min pbs rinses, cells were stained for 1 min in 1 pg/ml
hoechst dye no. 33258 (calbiochem-behringcorp., lajolla, ca)
to visualize dna, then rinsed 3 x 3 min in pbs. coverslips were
mounted in mounting medium containing 2.5% (w/v) of 1,4diazabicyclo(2.2.2)octane (dabcq) (aidrich chem. corp.,
milwaukee, wi) dissolved in 9 parts glycerol to 1 part tris
(bio-rad) buffer. ph 8 -6,for observation. au cells were examined
with either a zeiss axiophot microscope or a zeiss universal
microscope with epifluorescence optics. micrographs were taken
on ilford xp 1-400 asa film.
the following primary antibodies were used: 6-llb-1 mouse
monoclonal antibody against acetylated a-tubulin (piperno and

fuller 1985) was a gift from g. piperno; yol 1/34, a rat
monoclonal antibody which stains most forms of a-tubulin
(kilmartin et 01. 1982), was purchased from dimension
laboratories, mississauga, ont.; mouse monoclonal antibody to
 xxxg1400xxx  (clone ap-18) (binder et al. 1984) was a gift from l. i.
binder; and rabbit polyclonal anti-vimentin (fedoroff et a/.
1982-1983) was a gift from v. kalnins.
the following secondary antibodies were used: fitc-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit igg (miles-yeda ltd. research products, elkhart,
in); rhodamine-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse igg, cross-absorbed
against rat (zymed, dimension laboratories, mississauga, ont.);
and fitc-conjugated rabbit anti-rat igg, cross-adsorbed against
mouse (zymed).

results
uncommitted p19 cells were induced to differentiate along
the neural pathway by addition of
m ra and
surveyed at 24-h intervals by indirect immunofluorescence
for the distribution of vimentin ifs,  xxxg1400xxx , and colchicinestable acetylated mts. most uncommitted p19 cells contain
no filamentous vimentin, but do have a diffuse background
stain (fig. la). only a few, colchicine-stable acetylated mts
are present in uncommitted cells (fig. 1b) (falconer et al.
19891.
during the 24-h period after addition of ra, which we
define as stage 1 differentiation, vimentin staining remains
diffuse (fig. lc). however, at this time, short bundles of
colchicine-stable, acetylated mts are induced in most cells
although no cytoplasmic extensions are visible (fig. 16).
during stage 2, about 48 h after ra addition, filamentous
vimentin becomes a prominent feature (fig. le). also at this
time, cytoplasmic processes are extended and are easily seen
by staining the stable, acetylated mt population (fig. lj).
although differentiation is not synchronous, most processes
are less than five cell bodies in length. in some cells, growth
cones can be identified (arrow, fig. lj).
by stage 3, from 72 h after ra addition and onward, a
complex pattern of neurons is present. when cells are double
stained for vimentin (fig. 1g) and acetylated mts (fig. lh),
very little colocalization of staining is observed.
although we believed the vimention ifs in the colchicinetreated cells would collapse around the nucleus, we were
surprised to find that in a small, but constant proportion
of colchicine-treated cells (less than 5% of the differentiating
cells), the vimentin if network does not collapse (fig. 24,
but, instead, is similar in distribution to the acetylated, stable
mt array (fig. 2b). this colocahation is limited to the brief
period of stage 2 differentiation. during stage 1, no filamentous vimentin is present (see fig. lc), and during stage 3,
double labeling shows very little colocalization with
acetylated mts (see figs. l g and 1h).
 xxxg1400xxx  staining first appears during stage 2 differentiation. double labeling of colchicine-treated cells shows that
all cells with stable mts (fig. 3a) also stain for  xxxg1400xxx 
(fig. 3b) .  xxxg1400xxx  can be identified in cells without processes,
in cells with a single process, and in cells with twa or more
processes (fig. 3b). however, by stage 3, double labeling
of acetylated mts pig. 3c) and  xxxg1400xxx  (fig. 3d) shows
m a p 2 is now localized to only some of the neurites which
contain stable, acetylated mts. the  xxxg1400xxx  positive processes have, presumably, differentiated into dendrites
(peng et al. 1986).
since stage 2 stable, acetylated mts colocalize with vimentin ifs and with  xxxg1400xxx , vimentin ifs should also colocalize

with  xxxg1400xxx . double staining with vimentin and  xxxg1400xxx 
antibodies confirms this (figs. 4a and 4b).
from these results, we postulated that during stage 2,
stable, acetylated mts,  xxxg1400xxx , and vimentin ifs are linked
together to form a stabilizing structure in the newly extending processes. if this linkage exists, disruption or elimination of one of the components should affect the others. to
test this hypothesis, we analyzed the effect on the colchicine-

stable cytoskeleton complex of two disrupting agents, 4 mm
acrylamide and 150 pm  xxxd2041xxx . acrylamide has been
shown to induce collapse of the if network, resulting in a
"cap" of ifs near the nucleus (eckert 1985;sager 1989).
 xxxd2041xxx , a drug used in cancer therapy, binds preferentially to  xxxg1400xxx , inhibiting mt assembly and thereby
resulting in net depolyrnerization of mt arrays (stearns and
tew 1988).

exposure to acrylamide results in loss of vimentin ifs
from the processes and formation of a diffusely staining
vimentin "cap" near the nucleus (fig. 5a). acetylated mts
remain in the processes (fig. 5b).  xxxg1400xxx  is not detectable
or is present only as a faint, diffuse cytoplasmic stain (figure
not shown). to test if these remaining acetylated mts are
still stable against colchicine-induced depolymerization, a
combined drug treatment was used. stage 2 cells were
exposed to acrylamide for 5 h and colchicine was added
during the last 45 min of treatment. with this procedure,
vimentin ifs were collapsed and no longer present in the
process (fig. 5c), no colchicine-stable acetylated mts
remained in the process (fig. 5 4 , and  xxxg1400xxx  could not be
detected (figure not shown). in addition, the processes in
this combined treatment were very short (fig. 5e) and few

in number, implying that many had completely retracted and
were no longer detectable.
in  xxxd2041xxx -treated cells, double labeled for vimentin
and acetylated tubulin, most vimentin ifs are absent from
the process. the vimentin staining pattern shows a diffuse
stain in the cell body and a few discrete filaments near the
nucleus (fig. 6a). no acetylated mts remain in the process,
and the few mts present are colocalized to the remaining
vimentin filaments (fig. 6b). the process itself is quite short
(fig. 6 4 . when cells are double labeled for  xxxg1400xxx  and

discussion
in pi9 cells, during the first 24 h of neuronal differentiation (stage i), a population of colchicine-stable, acetylated
mts appears (falconer et al. 1989). it is not known what
stabilizes these mts, but stable mts are often posttranslationally modified by acetylation of a-tubulin (l'hernault
and rosenbaum 1983) and acetylation itself may play some
role in mt stabilization (piperno et al. 1987).
the initial stabilization of mts may be enhanced at
stage 2 differentiation (48 h after induction with ra) by the
introduction of  xxxg1400xxx , which colocalizes with colchicinestable mts. in vitro studies have shown that maps increase
mt stability (kirschner 1978) and influence spacing between
adjacent mts (brown and berlin 1985). this  xxxg1400xxx 
mediated stabilization of differentiating cells is apparently
also a transient phenomenon as shown by the results in this
article.
in p19 cultures induced to differentiate along neural
pathways, the simultaneous colocalization of stable
acetylated mts,  xxxg1400xxx , and vimentin ifs is seen only
during the brief period of stage 2, when process outgrowth
first appears. when this cytoskeletal complex is treated with
disrupting agents, perturbation of one element of the complex results in reorganization or altered stability of the other
elements. this suggests that the three elements are associated
together with  xxxg1400xxx  as the probable linking agent between
the mts and vimentin ifs.  xxxg1400xxx  has been suggested to
be a cross-linking protein between mts and ifs (reviewed by
matus, 1988), and an association of  xxxg1400xxx  with mts and
vimentin in flat cells from primary cultures of mature rat
brain has been demonstrated (bloom and vallee 1983).
in differentiated cells in situ, vimentin is characteristic of

cells of mesenchymal origin, but is also expressed by and
considered a marker of cells derived from the neuroectoderm, including astrocytes and radial glial cells (schnitzer
et al. 1981). most continuous cell lines express vimentin;
however, filamentous vimentin staining in p19 cells is almost
certainly related to differentiation and is not a result of
culturing the cells in vitro. in uncommitted ec cultures, we
find only about 15% of cells have some amount of filamentous vimentin staining. the remaining cells have a diffuse background stain, which may indicate the presence of
unpolyrnerized vimentin. significant amounts of filamentous
vimentin are not seen in our cells until 48 h after the addition of ra. paulin et al. (1982) documented the occurrence
of filamentous vimentin in 17 different ec cell lines (not
including the p19 line) and found that the percentage of cells
containing vimentin varies from line to line, but all lines
express more vimentin after treatment with ra.
during differentiation, vimentin is the first if protein
expressed in p19 cells (levine and flynn 1986). nf staining
is not seen until 3 or more days after addition of ra (levine
and flynn 1986; vielkind et al. 1989), while gfap arises
at least several days after nfs are seen (jones-villeneuve
et al. 1982). since it is nf and gfa proteins that are considered the definitive markers for neurons and glial cells,
respectively, it is not possible to predict what will be the final
differentiated state of stage 2 cells.
during development of the mouse embryo nervous
system, vimentin is first detected on the 9th day of gestation
@9), in processes arising from the basal plate neuroepithelium of the neural tube (houle and fedoroff 1983).
however, neither nfs nor gfaf are expressed at this stage
of mouse embryo development (schnitzer et al. 1981;
bignarni et al. 1982). houle and fedoroff (1983) and
schnitzer et al. (1981) suggest that the first cells to express

vimentin may be ventricular cells, a neural stem cell which
retains the capacity for multipotential differentiation along
either neuronal or glial pathways.
the absence of vimentin ifs from p19 cells during the
first 24 h of neural differentiation may be analogous t o the
absence of vimentin in the neural tube before embryonic
day 9 (e9). similarly, the period of colocalization of
vimentin ifs with acetylated mts and with  xxxg1400xxx  in newly
extending processes of p19 cells may correspond to the time
when filamentous vimentin appears in processes extended by
e9 ventricular cells.
the vimentin if -  xxxg1400xxx  - acetylated mt complex may
be present in a relatively unspecified stem cell which retains
the ability to modify various components during subsequent
differentiation. thus, we suggest that acetylated mts, found
both in neurites (cambray-deakin and burgoyne 1987) and
in glial processes (sale et al. 1988), will remain, regardless
of the subsequent differentiation pathway. if the cell
commits to the glial lineage, acetylated mts and vimentin
ifs will remain and gfap will be subsequently added. however,  xxxg1400xxx  may be replaced by map 1b or another map.
if the neuronal lineage is chosen, vimentin ifs first will
coexist with nf protein and then will be replaced by nf
protein, as seen during neuronal differentiation in embryos
(ziller et al. 1983; bignami et al. 1982).  xxxg1400xxx  will remain
in dendritic processes and will be replaced by another map
in axons.
in differentiating p19 cells, and possibly during embryogenesis as well, the stabilization of a newly extended process
may itself be important in determining the final differentiation path, particularly if surrounding cells provide a signal
that is perceived by the extension.
our results also substantiate that the p19 ec cell culture
is a good model system to study neurogenesis. unlike neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma (pc 12) cultures, which
derive from neurally committed cells, the p19 culture
consists of pluripotent cells (jones-villeneuve et al. 1982;
edwards and mcburney 1983). thus, early events, which
may have already taken place in neuroblastoma and
p c 12 stem cells, can be observed in differentiating
p19 cells. in addition, differentiating neurons in
p19 cultures have the same alterations in if population and
distribution as reported in vivo (levine and flynn 1986).
however, neurogenesis in neuroblastoma and pc 12 cultures
is atypical, with neurons retaining both vimentin ifs and
neurofilaments throughout differentiation (shea and nixon
1988).
