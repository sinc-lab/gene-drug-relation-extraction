thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are among the most commonly used antihypertensives and
have been available for over 50 years. however, the mechanism by which these drugs chronically
lower blood pressure is poorly understood. possible mechanisms include direct endothelial- or
vascular smooth muscle-mediated vasodilation and indirect compensation to acute decreases
in cardiac output. in addition, thiazides are associated with adverse metabolic effects, particularly
hyperglycemia, and the mechanistic underpinnings of these effects are also poorly understood.
thiazide-induced hypokalemia, as well as other theories to explain these metabolic disturbances,
including increased visceral adiposity, hyperuricemia, decreased glucose metabolism and
pancreatic b-cell hyperpolarization, may play a role. understanding genetic variants with
differential responses to thiazides could reveal new mechanistic candidates for future research
to provide a more complete understanding of the blood pressure and metabolic response to
thiazide diuretics.

in the usa, approximately one in three adults
suffers from hypertension [1] . the lifetime risk for
developing hypertension is very high, estimated
at almost 90% in those who live to 80–85 years
of age [2] . hypertension is a known risk factor
for both heart disease and stroke. in fact, 69% of
people who have their first heart attack and 77%
who have their first stroke have previously been
diagnosed with hypertension [1] . hypertension
is also a major economic concern; an estimated
us$73.4 billion was spent in 2009 on direct and
indirect costs relating to hypertension [1] .
the thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide
( xxxd2294xxx ) is the second most commonly prescribed
antihypertensive in the usa, with approximately
47.5 million prescriptions dispensed in 2008 [101] .
because most hypertensives require multidrug
regimens for blood pressure control, many more
patients are exposed to  xxxd2294xxx  through the use
of combination antihypertensive products. other
less prescribed thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics
include  xxxd1680xxx ,  xxxd2343xxx ,  xxxd2627xxx ,
 xxxd299xxx  and chlorothiazide. these
drugs’ low cost and antihypertensive effectiveness

have made them attractive choices for the manage­
ment of hypertension for almost half a century. in
addition, current hypertension treatment guidelines in the usa recommend ­thiazide diuretics
as a first-line treatment for most patients with
essential hypertension [2] .
despite the widespread use of this drug class, the
mechanism by which thiazide diuretics lower blood
pressure remains poorly understood. in addition,
while many agree that thiazides adversely affect
glucose and lipid homeostasis, only hypotheses
currently exist as to why and how these metabolic
effects occur. the aim of this article is to review
the existing knowledge surrounding the mechanisms by which thiazides lower blood pressure
and cause adverse metabolic effects. in addition,
phenotypes of genetic variants will be discussed
to provide insights into possible ­mechanistic
­candidates that warrant further research.
antihypertensive effects

thiazides achieve their diuretic action via inhibition of the na+/cl- cotransporter (ncc) in the
renal distal convoluted tubule [3–5] . the ncc

facilitates the absorption of sodium from the distal tubules back
to the interstitium and accounts for approximately 7% of total
sodium reabsorption [6] . by decreasing sodium reabsorption, thiazide use acutely results in an increase in fluid loss to urine, which
leads to decreased extracellular fluid (ecf) and plasma volume.
this volume loss results in diminished venous return, increased
renin release, reduced cardiac output and decreased blood pressure [7] . within days, the reduction in cardiac output increases total
peripheral resistance (tpr), which stems mostly from activation
of the sympathetic nervous system (sns) and renin–angiotensin–
aldosterone system (raas) [8,9] . this acute effect is evidenced
by the fact that an infusion of dextran, a volume expander, during the acute thiazide treatment phase restores blood pressure to
­pretreatment levels [10] .
chronically, however, thiazides must lower blood pressure via
some other mechanism. plasma and ecf volumes almost fully
recover within 4–6 weeks of thiazide initiation, yet blood pressure reduction is maintained [8,11] . after chronic administration,
discontinuation of thiazides result in a decrease in renin levels and
rapid volume replenishment, although the rise in blood pressure
is much slower [12] . in addition, when given a dextran infusion,
patients taking thiazides over longer periods of time (>2 months)
experience an expansion of body fluid volume but blood pressure
does not increase to baseline [12] . in addition, if diuretics simply
lowered blood pressure by reducing plasma volume, then one
would expect loop diuretics (such as furosemide,  xxxd3404xxx  and
bumetanide), which are superior diuretics to thiazides, to be superior antihypertensives. however, loop diuretics do not lower blood
pressure to the degree thiazides do (although some difficulty exists
in establishing equivalent doses) [13,14] . the aforementioned evidence indicates that the chronic thiazide antihypertensive effect
is not exclusively due to a loss of blood volume.
research has shown for decades that a decrease in tpr plays
an important role in the antihypertensive effect of thiazide diuretics over the long term [7,8,10] . however, the mechanism of this
decrease in tpr has not been fully elucidated. many hypotheses
exist to describe this mechanism (figure 1) , with varying amounts
of ­evidence to support them.
direct vasodilatory effects

many have hypothesized that the thiazide-associated decrease in
tpr could be the result of a direct vasodilatory effect, perhaps
separate from the diuretic effect [15–18] . multiple reports suggest
a reduced vasoconstrictive effect of various pressor agents in
animals and humans pretreated with thiazides [17,18] . however,
these findings do not specify whether the effect was by direct
vasodilation or stemming from an indirect action, such as volume
depletion [15] .
direct action on the endothelium has been implicated in the
acute vascular actions of thiazides. methaclothiazide inhibited
norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction in the aortas of spontaneously hypertensive rats, but not in wistar–kyoto (non­
hypertensive) rats [19] . removal of the endothelium abolished
this response in spontaneously hypertensive rat aortas, as did
treatment with nw-nitro-l-arginine, a  xxxd2738xxx  synthesis
794

inhibitor [19] . in addition,  xxxd2294xxx  and  xxxd2343xxx  were found to
dilate guinea pig mesentery arteries in vitro [20,21] . when arteries were cotreated with charybdotoxin, an inhibitor of the large
conductance calcium-activated potassium (kca) channel,  xxxd2294xxx 
caused a reduced vasorelaxant effect, suggesting that  xxxd2294xxx  has
direct vascular relaxant effects via opening of the kca channel [21] .
clinically, when infused in the brachial artery,  xxxd2294xxx  caused
a local vasodilation in hypertensive subjects [22] . the addition
of tetraethylammonium, another inhibitor of the kca channel,
abolished this effect, further implicating the kca channel in the
mechanism of dilation [22] . it is important to note that the thiazide
doses used in these infusions resulted in plasma concentrations of
11 µg/ml, which is approximately 10–20 times the plasma concentration found in patients clinically treated with thiazides [23,24] .
moreover, these findings were contrary to previous studies, which
did not find any vasoactivity in the human forearm, although such
studies used doses more comparable to those found in clinical
practice [25,26] . last, the difference in thiazide-induced vasodilation did not appear to vary between hypertensives and normotensives [22] . because thiazides generally have a negligible blood
pressure-lowering effect in normotensives, the clinical impact of
this vasodilation is debatable.
since the kca channel is ph activated, another hypothesis
explaining the chronic antihypertensive effect of thiazides is
that their carbonic anhydrase-inhibiting ability affects kca channel activity [27] . this hypothesis is supported by data indicating
that  xxxd299xxx , which possesses minimal carbonic
anhydrase-inhibiting activity, has only negligible effects on norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction, which is not influenced by
charybdotoxin [27] . in addition, the rise in intracellular ph from
carbonic anhydrase inhibition was not inhibited by charybdo­
toxin [27] . if this hypothesis were correct, then  xxxd299xxx  would have to reduce tpr by a mechanism different
from all other thiazides. however, no evidence exists to support
this concept.
unlike  xxxd2294xxx ,  xxxd2343xxx  was not shown to have a reduced
vasorelaxant effect in the brachial arteries of human subjects [22] ,
or guinea pig mesentery arteries cotreated with charybdotoxin [21] .
thus, it may be that  xxxd2343xxx  chronically lowers blood pressure via a different mechanism than  xxxd2294xxx . reports have shown
that  xxxd2343xxx  inhibits norepinephrine-induced ca 2+ influx in
various animal artery types [28,29] . thus, unlike other thiazides,
 xxxd2343xxx  may have some calcium antagonist-like activities that
could contribute to its chronic blood pressure-lowering ability.
hydrochlorothiazide and  xxxd1680xxx  were shown to exhibit
weak vasorelaxant effects in multiple rat vessel types, but only in
the presence of plasma [30] . the key cofactor in the plasma required
for the vasorelaxant effect was later shown to be albumin [31] .
however, thiazides have shown a high affinity for albumin binding, which would cause a reduction in free thiazide concentration.
the mechanism of this thiazide–albumin-dependent vasodilation
remains unclear and requires further research for elucidation.
recently, clinically used concentrations of  xxxd2294xxx  and chlor­
thalidone were shown to significantly reduce both  xxxg99xxx 
and norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction in rat aortic rings [32] .

the magnitude of reduction was similar to that of a specific rho
kinase inhibitor [32] . this reduction in vasoconstriction occurred
without changes in cellular calcium levels, suggesting calcium
desensitization as a possible mechanism for thiazides’ chronic antihypertensive effect. furthermore, rhoa and  xxxg1969xxx  expression were decreased in vascular smooth muscle cells when treated
with  xxxd2294xxx  or  xxxd1680xxx  [32] . this change in expression was
endothelium independent, suggesting that thiazide action occurs
directly on the smooth muscle. this latter finding is contrary to
data mentioned previously, which indicate that the vasodilatory
effect of thiazides is an endothelial-­dependent mechanism [19] .
thus, the source of a direct ­thiazide-induced vasodilatory effect
remains unclear.
indirect vasodilatory effects

rather than a direct action on the vasculature, the thiazide-­
mediated reduction in tpr could be the result of a systemic loss
of fluid or electrolytes, which cause a reaction from the vasculature [16] . one long-standing indirect vasodilation hypothesis
is reverse whole-body regulation [33] . specifically, this hypothesis states that blood vessels adapt to the initial thiazide-induced
plasma volume loss and decrease in cardiac output by constricting [33] . then, over time, vessels dilate to increase cardiac output
back toward baseline levels [33] . according to this hypothesis,
www.expert-reviews.com

the thiazide-induced vasodilation would originate from sodiuminduced fluid loss, via inhibition of the ncc. in support of this
mechanism, some evidence indicates that sodium balance controls
the blood pressure response to thiazides. the addition of 20 g of
salt daily to  xxxd2294xxx -treated hypertensives practically abolishes the
antihypertensive effect of the drug [12] . in addition, if sodium loss
was the major mechanism of tpr reduction, one would expect
kidney function to be necessary for thiazide-induced antihypertensive effects, as the kidneys are the primary organ responsible
for sodium excretion. in fact,  xxxd2294xxx  and  xxxd2627xxx  have little blood pressure-lowering effect in patients undergoing hemo­
dialysis [34] . on the other hand, evidence also exists to contradict
reverse whole-body regulation. primarily, a poor correlation exists
between acute volume loss and chronic antihypertensive effect [35] ,
which would not be expected if fluid loss (via loss of sodium) drove
the decrease in tpr.
analysis of genetic variants

gitelman’s syndrome is an autosomal recessive renal disorder characterized by hypokalemia, hypomagnesmia, hypocalciuria, metabolic alkalosis and low blood pressure [36] . gitelman’s syndrome
has been traced to inactivating mutations in  xxxg2080xxx , the gene
that encodes ncc. lack of functioning ncc should mimic the
effects observed when someone with functional ncc is treated

with a thiazide diuretic, making patients with the disease useful
mechanistic models for study. supporting this concept, a study
of  xxxg2080xxx  mutations in an amish population found those with
variant alleles had systolic and diastolic blood pressures approximately 8 mmhg lower than those without variant alleles [37] .
findings from the framingham heart study show that carriers
of renal ion channel (including  xxxg2080xxx ) mutations averaged
6.3 mmhg lower systolic and 3.4 mmhg lower diastolic blood
pressure compared with those without mutations [38] . the decrease
in blood pressure seen by these groups is similar to what is seen following treatment with thiazides. however, vaso­dilation appears to
play a role in the hypotension exhibited by those with gitelman’s
syndrome, at least in part by the upregulation of endothelial nitric
oxide synthase [39] . this finding is surprizing because  xxxg2080xxx 
is predominantly expressed in the kidney and is not known to be
expressed in the endothelium or vascular smooth muscle [40] . in
addition, tetraethylammonium was shown to abolish the vaso­
dilatory effect of  xxxd2294xxx  in vivo in patients with gitelman’s syndrome [22] . this evidence in patients with gitelman’s syndrome
suggests thiazide blood pressure lowering may chronically involve
the kca channel rather than ncc.
furthermore, variation in genes involved in thiazide response
could provide a link associating these genes with thiazide blood
pressure-lowering mechanisms. one such candidate gene,  xxxg2034xxx 
(the gene encoding the g-subunit of the epithelial sodium channel
[enac]), has previously been implicated in the thiazide blood
pressure response. those with polymorphisms in  xxxg2034xxx  experienced a larger blood pressure response to  xxxd2294xxx  than those

without [41,42] . since thiazides may indirectly influence enac
activation via the decrease in luminal calcium concentrations [43] ,
enac’s role in the thiazide-induced blood pressure response should
be investigated further.
another gene, wnk1 (the gene encoding without lysine
kinase 1), has also been associated with the blood pressure
response to thiazides. patients with polymorphisms in wnk1
achieved greater blood pressure lowering from  xxxd2294xxx  than those
without wnk1 polymorphisms [42] . this finding is potentially
important because wnk1 has been associated with an increase in
ncc activity [44] , which perhaps strengthens the evidence linking ncc to thiazide chronic blood pressure lowering. thus, the
exploration of wnk1 as a mechanistic candidate gene for thiazide
response is warranted.
another mechanistic candidate gene is stk39, the gene encoding ste20/sps1-related proline/alanine-rich kinase. while not yet
tested for pharmacogenetic association, stk39 has been associated with increased blood pressure in humans and was suggested
as a possible thiazide response gene [45] . this kinase is a member
of the mapk-like superfamily and activates other ion channels,
including ncc by direct phosphorylation [46] . the study of
this gene could help further clarify the role of ncc in chronic
­thiazide-induced blood pressure lowering.

mechanisms for blood pressure-lowering & metabolic effects of thiazide & thiazide-like diuretics

prospective clinical trials show an association between thiazide
use and increased blood glucose, findings are mixed regarding the
association with new-onset diabetes [48–50,53,54] . however, many
issues must be considered when ­evaluating these associations in
these trials, including:
• most are post hoc findings and were not adequately powered to
assess this association

expert review of cardiovascular therapy downloaded from informahealthcare.com by korea university on 12/26/14
for personal use only.

• new-onset diabetes was defined differently in many studies
• many studies had follow-up durations of only a few years,
which may not be long enough to fully assess prolonged
­hyperglycemia
• comparing antihypertensive drug classes is difficult owing to
differing study designs [55]
in an effort to better interpret the findings of these studies, a
recent network meta-analysis of antihypertensive trials was published [51] . this analysis found that thiazides are associated with
higher risk of diabetes than placebo and, along with b-blockers,
had the highest risk of all major classes of antihypertensives [51] .
in addition to diabetes, alterations in ldl, hdl and tri­glycerides
have also been attributed to thiazides [50,56,57] . in one study, total
cholesterol and  xxxg175xxx  were elevated in patients treated
with  xxxd2294xxx  for 8 weeks, although these changes were not found
at 1 year [57] . however, following 1 year of treatment with  xxxd2294xxx ,
an increase in the ratio of ldl to hdl, as well as increases in
the ratio of  xxxg175xxx  to a1, were observed in another
study [50] . a high ldl to hdl ratio is a predictor of increased
risk of cardio­vascular disease [58] . in addition, a recent clinical trial
observed significantly increased triglycerides in abdominally obese
patients treated with  xxxd2294xxx  and atenolol, compared with nonobese patients [52] . at this time, the mechanism by which thiazides
alter lipid profiles is poorly understood.
mechanisms involving potassium

evidence shows that large potassium infusions (causing
>1–1.5 meq/l elevation in plasma potassium) enhance insulin
release by two to three times basal levels [59] . insulin can cause
increased cellular uptake of potassium, which is an important
mechanism of potassium disposal [60,61] . however, smaller increases
in potassium (<1 meq/l) do not appear to induce this insulinsecreting effect [61,62] . in one study, a moderate potassium infusion
given together with somatostatin (an inhibitor of insulin) decreased
insulin levels and significantly elevated potassium levels [62] . since
potassium excretion is not affected by somatostatin, the authors
concluded that this decrease in potassium tolerance must be due
to decreased insulin levels [62] . while the association between
increases in potassium and increases in insulin appears strong, less
evidence exists supporting the concept that decreased potassium
results in decreased insulin levels. deprivation of potassium in the
diet has been shown to decrease plasma insulin levels [63] , but has
also been shown to be ineffective in modulating glucose uptake [64] .
definitive evidence does not yet exist to answer whether decreases
in potassium on the order of those seen in thiazide-treated patients
cause decreases in insulin release [65] .
www.expert-reviews.com

review

the relationship between potassium and glucose homeostasis
is important because many believe that thiazide-induced potassium depletion drives hyperglycemia [65] . following thiazide
treatment, serum potassium levels decrease 0.2–0.6 meq/l in a
dose-­dependent manner [48,49,57] . since muscle blood flow markedly decreases in potassium-depleted dogs [66] , one of the simplest
hypotheses explaining the role of hypokalemia in hyperglycemia
attributes the hyperglycemia to decreased perfusion to skeletal
muscle [67] . decreasing glucose access to the skeletal muscle, which
metabolizes large amounts of glucose, would theoretically leave
more glucose circulating in the blood [67] . another hypothesis
involves the hyperpolarization of pancreatic b cells by the thiazide-induced opening of kca channels [68] . because thiazides have
been shown to open kca channels in vascular smooth muscle [21] ,
thiazides could also open these channels in pancreatic b cells,
decreasing intracellular potassium levels and hyperpolarizing the
cells [68] . this hyperpolarization would then inhibit calcium influx
and decrease insulin release, which is calcium dependent [68] . this
hypothesis would explain the reduction in calcium uptake found
when mouse islets were treated with  xxxd2294xxx  [69] .
clinically, conflicting data also exist regarding thiazide-induced
hypokalemia and diabetes. a meta-analysis of 59 clinical studies
showed a significant correlation between thiazide-induced potassium depletion and increased glucose levels in the blood, as well
as a correlation between potassium supplementation (or concomitant use of potassium-sparing agents) and attenuation of hyper­
glycemia [70] . of note, the authors derived these correlations from
the aggregate mean changes from several studies, rather than data
from individual patients. in addition, a secondary analysis of the
systolic hypertension in elderly patients (shep) trial investigated
the relationship between serum potassium and thiazide-induced
diabetes [71] . in support of the meta-analysis findings, risk for
developing diabetes was increased in the first year of thiazide treatment, but was not associated over the long term [71] . in addition,
independent of drug treatment, each 0.5‑meq/l decrease in serum
potassium was associated with a 45% increased risk for developing diabetes throughout the course of the study [71] . contrasting
these findings, a prospective study found no significant correlation between changes in serum potassium and serum glucose
in  xxxd2294xxx -treated patients [72] . a similar lack of correlation was
found between changes in serum potassium and plasma insulin
levels [72] . while these findings do not rule out the possibility
that intracellular potassium is correlated with hyper­glycemia or
diabetes risk, measuring intracellular potassium is not usual clinical practice and these data suggest limited usefulness of serum
potassium monitoring for the prevention of ­thiazide-associated
hyperglycemia or new-onset diabetes.
other mechanisms

alteration in fat composition is another possible mechanism for
thiazide-induced dysglycemia. free  xxxd2154xxx  have been shown
to decrease insulin secretion of pancreatic b cells in response to
glucose [73] . recently, a clinical trial found patients treated with
25–50 mg of  xxxd2294xxx  had significant reductions in insulin sensitivity, compared with those treated with candesartan or placebo [74] .

serum potassium levels were significantly lower in patients taking
 xxxd2294xxx , but levels in all groups remained within normal limits and
potassium supplementation was allowed [74] . while on  xxxd2294xxx ,
patients also developed a significantly higher hepatic fat content,
and a significant correlation was found between hepatic fat content and decrease in insulin sensitivity [74] . whether decreased
insulin sensitivity was a result of this visceral fat accumulation,
or vice versa, has not been established. furthermore, c-reactive
protein was also significantly increased with  xxxd2294xxx  treatment [74] ,
indicating a possible role for inflammation in the development of
insulin resistance. in support of this hypothesis, a recent prospective clinical trial reported that patients with abdominal obesity
were more likely to experience new-onset diabetes with  xxxd2294xxx 
treatment than those without abdominal obesity [52] .
hyperuricemia has also been implicated in thiazide-induced
metabolic effects, as thiazides can increase serum urate levels
by up to 35% [55] . in rats with fructose-induced metabolic syndrome given  xxxd2294xxx , correcting hyperuricemia improved insulin resistance and hypertriglyceridemia to similar levels before
 xxxd2294xxx  treatment [75] . in addition, patients treated with  xxxd2294xxx 
experience significantly increased levels of serum  xxxd3472xxx  [52] .
importantly, this increase in  xxxd3472xxx  was associated with a greater
than ­threefold increased risk of developing diabetes [52] .
a recent hypothesis involves direct downregulation of  xxxg1807xxx 
by thiazides, which would decrease insulin release. as mentioned
previously, thiazides decrease cardiac output and reduce plasma
and extracellular fluid volume. this change in plasma volume
induces an elevation in plasma renin activity, which is hypothesized to be a pathway by which thiazides may cause hyperglycemia [65] . the raas interacts with the  xxxg1807xxx  signaling pathway [76] , and increased plasma renin activity results in an increase
in  xxxg99xxx , which has been shown in mice to downregulate
 xxxg1807xxx  [77] .
analysis of genetic variants

in an amish cohort, patients with gitelman’s syndrome were
reported to have decreased potassium levels compared with agematched family members, but did not have an increased incidence
of hyperglycemia [37] . in addition, despite their hypokalemic state,
it has been reported that these gitelman’s patients do not have
worse lipid profiles [43] . because patients with gitelman’s syndrome mimic thiazide-treated patients only to the extent of ncc
impairment, these data may suggest thiazides induce dysglycemia
via a mechanism other than their ncc-antagonizing effect.
the clinical opposite of gitelman’s syndrome, pseudohypo­
aldosteronism type ii (phaii), is characterized by hyperkalemia,
metabolic acidosis and high blood pressure [78] . administration of
a thiazide diuretic often corrects these abnormalities. mutations
in the genes encoding wnk1 and wnk4 have been traced to
the cause of this disease. a loss-of-function mutation in wnk4
(which inhibits ncc) causes overactivation of ncc, while a
gain-of-function mutation in wnk1 (which can reduce wnk4
inhibition) also causes overactivation [78] . when treated with a
thiazide diuretic, patients with phaii have potassium levels that
drop from an average of 5.7 to 4.6 meq/l [79] . however, these
798

patients still experience increased plasma glucose, which suggests
a lack of association between hypokalemia and thiazide-induced
hyperglycemia [79] . however, it may be the magnitude of decrease
in potassium, rather than actual potassium level, that influences
the increase in glucose levels.
genetic predictors of metabolic adverse effects were analyzed in a population of hypertensives treated with  xxxd2294xxx  [80] .
significant predictors for thiazide-induced increase in total cholesterol included polymorphisms in the genes encoding renin
(ren) and the b-1 adrenergic receptor ( xxxg91xxx ). predictors for
thiazide-induced triglyceride elevation included polymorphisms
in the genes encoding  xxxg99xxx  (agt ), endothelial nitric
oxide synthase ( xxxg1579xxx ) and wnk1. furthermore, the genes encoding the potassium inwardly rectifying channel ( xxxg1249xxx ) and the
b-2 adrenergic receptor ( xxxg92xxx ) were genetic predictors for elevated glucose. perhaps polymorphisms in these genes (and likely
­others) collectively contribute toward a clinically significant rise
in blood glucose.
recently, a pharmacogenetic case–control study implicated
genes in the raas system as playing a role in thiazide-induced
diabetes. patients with polymorphisms in the guanine nucleotide binding protein, b-polypeptide 3 gene (gnb3) displayed
decreased risk of diabetes associated with thiazide use, and
those with polymorphisms in ace displayed increased risk [81] .
while this study was retrospective and thus subject to important limitations, these findings help our understanding of
the complex thiazide–hyperglycemia association and warrant
further investigation.
expert commentary

despite decades of use and study, much of the data regarding
thiazide mechanisms of action are in conflict. most of the blood
pressure-lowering mechanistic studies are small, in vitro projects
using animal rather than human tissue, and many are more than
20 years old. in many of these older studies, the diuretic doses
(or equivalent in vitro concentrations) used were 50 mg of  xxxd2294xxx 
or more. current guidelines recommend 50 mg as the maximum
dose of  xxxd2294xxx  for the treatment of hypertension [2] , and today clinicians do not often prescribe doses greater than 25 mg of  xxxd2294xxx 
or its equivalent for hypertension. it is uncertain whether many
noted effects witnessed in these older studies would be observed
using lower doses. in addition, modern techniques and larger sample sizes could lead to the creation of data that are more reliable
and reproducible than in these older studies. another explanation
of why findings vary in many of these in vitro studies is that if,
in fact, vasodilatory effects only fully manifest themselves after
chronic use, such effects would fail to be detected in many of
these short-term studies.
recently, there has been controversy over the long-held notion
that all thiazides act similarly. the theory that all thiazides do not
have a similar efficacy or mechanism of action would help explain
the conflicting findings in many studies investigating their blood
pressure-lowering and metabolic effects, and has been addressed
previously by others [15] . evidence already exists documenting the
differences between  xxxd1680xxx  and  xxxd2294xxx , although whether

mechanisms for blood pressure-lowering & metabolic effects of thiazide & thiazide-like diuretics

they exhibit differential effects on clinical outcomes is unclear [82] .
regardless, the mechanisms by which thiazides exert blood pressure-lowering and metabolic effects remain incompletely understood. from the current evidence, thiazides appear to exert their
effects via multiple complex and interacting mechanisms.
studying functional variants of ncc function, such as those
with gitelman’s syndrome, is useful in better understanding the
effects of thiazide diuretics. while nonfunctional ncc seems
to mimic the effect seen in patients taking thiazides, differences
exist that make this model imperfect. in addition to examples
given in previous sections, some component of vascular inflammation likely exists in hypertensives that is not seen in those with
gitelman’s syndrome. in addition, pharmacogenetic studies can
provide mechanistic leads that have not been previously investigated. however, as pharmacogenetic findings can often fail to
replicate [83] , replication and functional studies must be provided
to confirm true mechanistic candidates.

review

of thiazides’ desired and undesired effects. with additional knowledge, it may be possible to better identify which patients are most
likely to experience robust blood ­pressure-lowering effects, but
minimal metabolic effects.
while thiazide diuretics will likely remain an important component of hypertension therapy, particularly for patients requiring multiple medications, future guidelines will probably be
more conservative with regard to which patients thiazides are
recommended for. avoidance will probably be suggested, when
possible, in those at greatest risk for adverse metabolic effects.
the apparent absence of metabolic effects and increasing generic
availability of arbs, calcium channel blockers and ace inhibitors also provide alternative antihypertensive options for clinicians. nevertheless, the efficacy of thiazides and low cost will
keep them in use as a potent medication option for many patients
with hypertension.

five-year view

a recent call for research by the nih national heart, lung and
blood institute emphasizes the need for a better understanding
of the mechanisms of action of thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics [65] . based on the call for research and issues raised in this article,
future research is needed help to better elucidate the mechanisms

key issues
• some of the most commonly prescribed antihypertensives, thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are thought to chronically lower blood
pressure primarily by reducing total peripheral resistance.
• how thiazides reduce total peripheral resistance is unclear. one hypothesis involves thiazides exerting a direct action on blood vessels.
another hypothesis involves an indirect mechanism, perhaps via a chronic vascular response to acute decreases in plasma volume.
• thiazides are also thought to increase the risk of metabolic disturbances, particularly hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. thiazideassociated hypokalemia is a popular but controversial theory as a cause of hyperglycemia. other theoretical mechanisms include
hyperuricemia, alterations in fat distribution, and  xxxg1807xxx  downregulation.
• the evidence for many proposed mechanisms are conflicting, raising the prospect that thiazides may have many complex and
interacting mechanisms, or even slightly different mechanisms of action.
