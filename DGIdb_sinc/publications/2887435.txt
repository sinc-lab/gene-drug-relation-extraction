8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-ohdpat) has effects both characteristic of a serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-ht) agonist and antagonist. to investigate the mechanism(s) of action of 8-ohdpat in vivo, rats were
trained to discriminate 8-ohdpat (0.4 mg/kg) from saline and given various neuroactive compounds during
substitution test sessions. of the 5-ht agonists tested,  xxxd2527xxx , 5-methoxy- xxxd2686xxx , quipazine, ru 24969 and 1-(m-trifluoromethylphenyl) piperazine did not mimic the training drug; the dopamine
agonists apomorphine and skf 38393 as well as the a2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine engendered predominantly
saline-lever responding. however, the novel anxiolytics buspirone and ipsapirone as well as the ergot derivative
 xxxd2498xxx  substituted completely for 8-ohdpat. in combination tests, 5-ht ( xxxd2419xxx , metergoline,  xxxd2621xxx ,
pirenperone), dopamine (haloperidol) and norepinephrine antagonists ( xxxd3000xxx , propranolol) failed to attenuate the
8-ohdpat cue. the similar stimulus properties of 8-ohdpat and the novel anxiolytics (buspirone, ipsapirone) are
mirrored by the common abilities of these agents to selectively inhibit 5-ht1a binding and release punished
responding. thus, the subpopulation of 5-htia receptors may mediate the behavioral effects of these compounds in
animals and, in turn, the anxiolytic effects of buspirone and ipsapirone in humans. although not primarily selective
for 5-ht,  xxxd2498xxx  may also mimic 8-ohdpat by direct or indirect stimulation of 5-ht1a receptors.

1. introduction

8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8ohdpat) has behavioral and neurochemical effects characteristic of a postsynaptic serotonin (5hydroxytryptaminc; 5-ht) agonist; for example,
this partial ergoline decreases 5-ht turnover and
elicits the '5-ht syndrome' (hjorth et al., 1982).
however, in contrast to other 5-ht agonists, 81 a preliminary report of these data was presented at the
society for neuroscienceannual meeting (dallas, 1985).

o h d p a t releases punished responding (engel et
al., 1984), stimulates male sexual behavior
(ahlenius et al., 1981) and increases food intake in
rodents (dourish et al., 1985). these behavioral
findings coupled with the results of radioligand
binding studies in which [3h]8-ohdpat was
found to label both pre- and postsynaptic sites in
rat brain (gozlan et al., 1983; hall et al., 1985;
schoemaker and langer, 1986; verge et al., 1985)
suggest that 8-ohdpat may act as a 5-ht autoreceptor agonist a n d / o r postsynaptic 5-ht
antagonist. in fact, the possibility is strong that
8-ohdpat interacts with a specific subpopulati~n of 5-ht receptors: unlabelled 8-ohdpat
potently inhibits binding to 5-ht 1, especially 5-

ht1a (but not 5-ht2), receptors (hamon et al.,
1984; middlemiss and fozard, 1983).
drug discrimination procedures have provided
useful information regarding the importance of
5-ht receptor subtypes in the in vivo effects of
both 8-ohdpat as well as (other) serotonergic
compounds. for example, the stimulus effects of
1-(m-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine (tfmpp)
appear to be related to 5-htib receptor stimulation (cunningham and appel, 1986; glennon et
al., 1984a; mckenney and glennon, 1986) while
those of several phenylisopropylamines, d-lysergic
acid diethylamide (lsd) and quipazine involve
primarily 5-ht2 receptors (cunningham and appel, 1987; friedman et al., 1984; glennon et al.,
1983). interestingly, 8-ohdpat does not share
similar stimulus properties with any of these compounds (cunningham and appel, 1986; 1987;
cunningham et al., 1985; fozard et al., 1986;
glennon, 1986).
it thus appears that the in vivo effects of 8ohdpat are mediated by selective interactions
with some 5-ht receptor subtype other than 5htib or 5-ht2 or that the drug acts through
non-serotonergic mechanisms. given the ability of
8-ohdpat to disinhibit punished responding
(engel et al., 1984) and the recent suggestion that
 xxxg1108xxx  subtypes may be involved in the
mediation of anxiety (peroutka, 1985), an examination of the internal stimulus properties of
8-ohdpat could shed light upon the role of this
receptor subtype in the in vivo effects of the novel
anxiolytics. we therefore examined the discriminative stimulus effects of 8-ohdpat (0.4
mg/kg) more extensively than previously reported
by testing both novel and classical anxiolytics as
well as a wide range of doses of several putative
5-ht, dopamine (da) and norepinephrine (ne)
agonists and antagonists (both alone and, when
appropriate, in combination with the training
drug).
2. materials and methods

2.1. subjects
experimentally naive male rats of spraguedawley strain (charles river breeding laborato-

ries, wilmington, ma) were used (n = 24). each
animal was approximately 350 g at the beginning
of the investigation. they were housed individually and maintained at 80-85% of their free-feeding weights by restricting access to water. the
colony was maintained at constant temperature
(21-23°c) and humidity (45-50%) on a 12 h lightdark cycle (lights were on from 7:00 a.m.-7:00
p.m.).

2.2. apparatus
eight commercially available experimental
chambers (model no. 143-24; brs/lve, laurel,
md) were used; each was equipped with a 28 v
houselight and a dipper mounted equidistant between two levers on one wall. each chamber was
contained in a sound- and light-attenuating shell
(brs/lve model no. 132-04); a blower provided ventilation and masking noise. experimental
events and data collection were controlled by an
apple computer or electromechanical/solid state
circuits located in an adjoining room.

2.3. drugs
unless otherwise noted (below), dose-response
and substitution tests were conducted 15 min after
the administration of 8-ohdpat or novel compounds; antagonists were administered 60 min,
and 8-ohdpat, 15 min prior to testing. subgroups of rats (n = 8) were tested with several
doses of a test drug; the order of drugs and doses
tested was irregular while tests of novel compounds were separated by 3-5 days. the following
drugs were dissolved in deionized water; doses
refer to the weights of the salts (abbreviation;
injection interval; supplier): apomorphine hc1
(sigma); buspirone hc1 (bristol-myers); clonidine
hc1 (boehringer ingelheim); (+)-8-hydroxy-2-(din-propylamino)tetralin hbr (8-ohdpat; research biochemicals);  xxxd2419xxx  (janssen);  xxxd2498xxx  hydrogen maleate (schering ag);
 xxxd2527xxx  bitartrate (lsd; national institute on drug abuse, nida);  xxxd3000xxx 
hc1 (pfizer); methiothepin maleate (hoffmanlaroche); 5-methoxy- xxxd2686xxx  (5meodmt; sigma); 5-methoxy-3(1,2,3,6-tetra-

31
hydropyridin-4-yl) succinate (ru 24969; roussel
u c l a f ) ; 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-7,8-dihydroxy-1phenyl-lh-3-benzazepine (skf 38393; smith
kline and french); ipsapirone (tvx q 7821;
troponwerke); propranolol hc1 (sigma); quipazine maleate (miles). doses of metergoline (90
rain; farmitalia) refer to the weights of the base;
this agent was dissolved in 1%  xxxd228xxx  followed by deionized water while diazepam (hoffman-laroche), haloperidol (mcneil) and pirenperone (janssen) were diluted with deionized water
from ampules provided by suppliers. 1-(m-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine (tfmpp; aldrich)
was diluted with 0.1 n hc1 followed by deionized
water. compounds were injected intraperitoneally
(i.p.) in a volume of 1.0 ml/kg.

2.4. procedures
2.4.1. preliminary training
rats were injected i.p. with either 8-ohdpat
(0.4 mg/kg) or an equivalent volume of saline
(0.9%  xxxg2020xxx ) 15 min prior to each experimental
session. during this initial phase of training, only
the stimulus-appropriate (drug or saline) lever was
present. for half of the animals, presses on the left
lever were reinforced (with water) following drug
while presses on the right lever were reinforced
following saline; conditions were reversed for the
remaining animals. the training drug and saline
were administered in an irregular order with the
restriction that neither condition prevail for more
than three consecutive sessions. training began
under a fixed-ratio 1 (fr 1) schedule of reinforcement (ferster and skinner, 1957); each lever
press resulted in the presentation of the water-filled
dipper (0.1 ml/reinforcer). as response rates
stabilized, the f r requirement was increased until
all rats were responding reliably under an fr 20
schedule following either drug or saline.
2.4. 2. discrimination training
when responding had stabilized under fr 20,
both levers were presented simultaneously. rats
were required to respond on the stimulus-appropriate lever to receive reinforcement; there were
no programmed consequences following incorrect
responses. to control for the development of posi-

tion cues based upon olfactory stimuli, a random
relationship was maintained between the lever
programmed to deliver reinforcement for each
consecutive subject run in the same experimental
chamber (extance and goudie, 1981). training
sessions were 15 min in duration and were conducted at the same time each day, 5 days per
week.

2.4. 3. testing procedure
once animals demonstrated mean individual
accuracies of at least 85% correct over a period of
10 consecutive sessions, test sessions were initiated. these sessions were conducted 1-2 times
per week; training continued during intervening
days to maintain stimulus control. during these
tests, the rat was removed from the chamber
without reinforcement as soon as 20 responses on
either lever occurred. three pharmacological
manipulations were conducted during test sessions. in dose-response and substitution tests, rats
were tested for lever selection after administration
of a dose of 8-ohdpat or some other compound. in combination (antagonism) tests, rats
were tested after injection of a putative neurotransmitter antagonist in combination with 8ohdpat.
2.4. 4. data analysis
accuracy (percent correct) during discrimination training sessions is expressed as the percentage of correct to total responses prior to the
delivery of the first reinforcer; during test sessions, performance is expressed as the percentage
of drug-appropriate to total responses upon completion of an fr 20 on either lever. for purposes
of comparison, the rate of responding (number of
responses per min) has also been calculated as
total responses before either completion of an fr
20 on (a) the correct lever and, hence, before
delivery of the first reinforcer (training sessions),
or (b) either lever (test sessions), divided by the
number of minutes taken to complete this first
ratio. student's paired t-test was used to compare
the percentage of drug responses recorded during
a test session with that recorded during the immediately preceding drug or saline training session. since the focus of substitution and combina-

32

tion tests is to assess the similarity of novel agents
to the training drug and the ability of antagonists
to block the cue, respectively, comparisons of test
data with the immediately preceding 8 - o h d p a t
session are reported, as well as instances in which
the results of combination tests are not significantly different from the previous saline control
sessions. the dose-response functions of the
agonists that substituted were converted to loglogit functions. least squares linear regression
analyses were used to estimate the dose ( m g / k g )
of each agonist that would elicit 50% drug-lever
responding (eds0). response rate data from discrimination sessions were also analyzed with student's paired t-test.

points, included for comparison, show the degree of stimulus
control (square) and the response rate (circle) produced by
saline plus 8-ohdpat (0.4 mg/kg) administered under test

these data indicate that the putative 5-ht
agonist 8 - o h d p a t can readily be discriminated
from saline and thus confirm and extend previous
results to a higher training dose (fozard et al.,
1986; glennon, 1986). interestingly, response rates
during both 8 - o h d p a t (56.9 + 6) and saline
(61.5 + 5) training sessions were almost identical
(and therefore could not have been a factor in the
formation of the 8-ohdpat-saline discrimination). the 8 - o h d p a t dose-response curve was
relatively steep with an eds0 of 0.19 m g / k g , ap-

34

proximately one-half of the training dose.
since lsd, quipazine, ru 24969 and tfmpp
failed to mimic and  xxxd2419xxx , metergoline,
methiothepin and pirenpirone failed to block
drug-appropriate responding, the present results
support the argument that neither 5-htib or 5-ht 2
receptors are involved in the 8-ohdpat cue
(cunningham et al., 1985; fozard et al., 1986;
glennon, 1986) or, for that matter, a variety of
other behavioral effects (ahlenius et al., 1981;
dourish et al., 1985; engel et al., 1984) of this
'enigmatic' compound (tricklebank et al., 1984).
since 8-ohdpat is a potent inhibitor of 5-ht1a
binding (hamon et al., 1984; middlemiss and
fozard, 1983) and there is little evidence that this
compound acts through systems other than those
containing 5-ht (hjorth et al., 1982), it is reasonable to conclude that the in vivo effects of
8-ohdpat are mediated by a subpopulation of
5-ht receptors (5-htia) at which the above agents
may not be selective (cunningham et al., 1985;
fozard et al., 1986; glennon, 1986).
the inability of 5-meodmt to substitute for
8-ohdpat (present results) has previously been
reported (fozard et al., 1986; glennon, 1986) and
might be surprising given its proposed selectivity
for the  xxxg1108xxx  (sills et al., 1985). however, although 5-meodmt has little affinity for
5-htib sites, it does inhibit 5-ht 2 binding (glennon et al., 1984b) and mimics the stimulus properties of lsd (white and appel, 1982). thus, the
combined stimulation of 5- xxxd764xxx  and 5-ht 2 receptors in vivo could conceivably deprive 5meodmt of the selective effects necessary to be
perceived as similar to 8-ohdpat (fozard et al.,
1986; glennon, 1986).
the partial ergoline 8-ohdpat is structurally
similar to, and shares many neurochemical properties with  xxxd2498xxx  and lsd but, unlike the lysergic
acid derivative, 8-ohdpat does not potently alter catecholamine function (hjorth et al., 1982).
surprisingly,  xxxd2498xxx , but not lsd, substituted for
8-ohdpat. the possibility that da is involved
in these effects is unlikely since neither
apomorphine nor skf 38393 mimicked and
haloperidol did not block 8-ohdpat-appropriate repsonding. thus, similarities in the behavioral effects of  xxxd2498xxx  and 8-ohdpat

(ahlenius and larsson, 1985; ahlenius et al., 1981;
svensson, 1985) are probably related to some other
mechanism; for example, direct or indirect stimulation of 5-ht 1 (5-ht1a?) receptors (gerber et al.,
1984).
the novel anxiolytics buspirone and ipsapirone
share with 8-ohdpat a common ability to selectively inhibit 5-htia binding; these compounds
also release punished responding and produce the
5-ht syndrome (eison et al., 1986; engel et al.,
1984; hamon et al., 1984; middlemiss and fozard,
1983; peroutka, 1985; spencer et al., 1984; traber
et al., 1984). in the present study, buspirone and
ipsapirone mimicked the 8-ohdpat cue while
the 'classical anxiolytic' diazepam did not; this
differentiation among the stimulus effects of
buspirone and benzodiazepine anxiolytics has been
observed previously (hendry et al., 1983) and
parallels the observed differences in subjective
effects of these drugs in humans (goldberg, 1984).
these data also support the hypothesis that an
interaction with 5-ht (5-ht1a) neuronal systems
may underlie the in vivo effects of buspirone and
ipsapirone, possibly the anxiolytic effects of these
drugs (fozard et al., 1986; peroutka, 1985; traber
et al., 1984). clearly, a better understanding of
5-ht1a systems will advance our knowledge of the
neurochemical substrates of anxiety as well as the
mechanism(s) underlying the effects of potentially
useful anxiolytics (peroutka, 1985; traber et al.,
1984).
