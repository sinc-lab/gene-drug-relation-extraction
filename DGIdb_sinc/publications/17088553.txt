neuropathic pain is a debilitating condition affecting millions of
people around the world and is defined as pain that follows a
lesion or dysfunction of the nervous system. this type of pain is
difficult to treat, but the novel compounds pregabalin (lyrica) and
gabapentin (neurontin) have proven clinical efficacy. unlike traditional analgesics such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or
narcotics, these agents have no frank antiinflammatory actions and
no effect on physiological pain. although extensive preclinical
studies have led to a number of suggestions, until recently their
mechanism of action has not been clearly defined. here, we
describe studies on the analgesic effects of pregabalin in a mutant
mouse containing a single-point mutation within the gene encoding a specific auxiliary subunit protein (␣2-␦-1) of voltage-dependent calcium channels. the mice demonstrate normal pain phenotypes and typical responses to other analgesic drugs. we show that
the mutation leads to a significant reduction in the binding affinity
of pregabalin in the brain and spinal cord and the loss of its
analgesic efficacy. these studies show conclusively that the analgesic actions of pregabalin are mediated through the ␣2-␦-1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels and establish this subunit
as a therapeutic target for pain control.

europathic pain is a consequence of disease, trauma, or
dysfunction of the central or peripheral nervous systems. it can
result from a wide range of conditions including diabetes, nerve
root compression, herpes zoster infection, cancer, and stroke thus
affecting millions of people worldwide. many patients respond
poorly to conventional analgesics, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and despite the use of alternative therapeutic approaches including tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants,
effective management of neuropathic pain remains a significant
challenge. the novel compounds pregabalin (lyrica) and gabapentin (neurontin) have proven clinical efficacy in neuropathic pain
(1, 2) and are effective in other disorders of the nervous system
including epilepsy (3) and anxiety (4–6).
despite over a decade of extensive research, the exact mechanism of action of pregabalin and gabapentin has yet to be
elucidated, although a number of putative mechanisms have
been postulated [see taylor et al. for review (7)]. despite their
structural similarity to the inhibitory transmitter gamma amino
butyric acid (gaba), neither pregabalin nor gabapentin bind to
gabaa or gabab receptors, nor do they interact with gaba
uptake transporters (8), and studies suggesting that they may act
via a specific presynaptic gabab heterodimeric complex (9)
have been disproved (8, 10). in 1996, gee, brown, and coworkers
(11, 12) isolated and sequenced a gabapentin binding protein
from porcine brain. this was identified as the ␣2-␦ subunit of
voltage-gated calcium channels. the discovery of pregabalin and
its low-affinity enantiomer (r)-isobutylgaba suggested a relawww.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.0409066103

tionship between ␣2-␦ binding and analgesic activity (13). thus,
pregabalin (but not its enantiomer) demonstrated activity in a
number of preclinical models of pain (13). however, the importance of the interaction of gabapentin and pregabalin with this
protein has not been conclusively demonstrated.
calcium channels constitute a diverse class of proteins that have
been traditionally classified via their pharmacological and electrophysiological properties (14). these channels play a fundamental
role in the regulation of many biological processes with transient
changes in calcium ion concentration essential for neurotransmitter
release and modulation of cell-membrane excitability. ␣2-␦ is one of
three regulatory subunits along with ␤ and ␥ that configure around
the pore-forming ␣1 subunit (15, 16) to form the complete channel
complex. the ␣2-␦ protein is encoded by at least four genes. ␣2-␦-1
was the first to be identified and is the most widely studied, but this
has been followed by discovery of three other novel genes, ␣2-␦-2,
␣2-␦-3, and ␣2-␦-4, contributing to the heterogeneity of voltagedependent calcium channels (vdccs) (17). each of these subtypes
has been shown to display tissue-specific distribution (17). recent
studies have identified regions critical for gabapentin binding on the
␣2-␦ subunit (11, 18). these molecular studies have shown that a
mutation leading to the substitution of a single amino acid, arginine
at position 217 with alanine (r217a) on the ␣2-␦-1 protein prevents
gabapentin binding (18). in the present study, we demonstrate that
pregabalin binding is similarly affected and we have gone on to use
gene targeting technology to generate a mutant mouse (r217a
strain) in which the wt murine ␣2-␦-1 gene was replaced with a
copy containing the r217a mutation. we have used this mutation
and the mutant mouse to demonstrate the importance of the ␣2-␦-1
subunit for the analgesic action of pregabalin.

quantitative densitometry (fig. 2e) was performed on autoradiographs, and the binding signal for wt and r217a mutant mice

combination of  xxxg303xxx  and ␤1b was used for coexpression with
␣2-␦-1, to mimic one of the major calcium channel combinations
whose mrna is present in dorsal root ganglion (drg) neurons
(7). the amplitude of the ba2⫹ currents resulting from expression
of cav2.2兾␤1b subunits in tsa-201 cells was ⫺45.0 ⫾ 8.6 pa兾pf (at

r217a ␣2-␦-1 produced a smaller enhancement of  xxxg303xxx  currents
at the same potential (2.37- ⫾ 0.53-fold, n ⫽ 11, p ⫽ 0.035,
compared with wt ␣2-␦-1) (fig. 3 a and b). nevertheless, the peak
currents in the presence of r217a ␣2-␦-1 were still significantly
enhanced compared with those in the absence of ␣2-␦-1 (fig. 3 a
and b). the expression of the wt and r217a ␣2-␦-1 protein, as
determined by western blot analysis, was similar under the conditions of transfection used (data not shown). very similar results
were obtained after expression in xenopus oocytes, where the mean

nocifensive response. the first (early) phase was seen in the first 10
min where the animals lick and bite the hind paw resulting in ⬇75
s of nocifensive activity (fig. 4a). the second period (late phase)
started after ⬇15 min, peaked at 20–35 min, and was largely
complete by the 45-min time point resulting in ⬇160 s of nocifensive
activity (fig. 4a).
pregabalin (30 mg兾kg) and morphine (3 mg兾kg) produced a
significant blockade of the late-phase nocifensive response in the
wt mice (fig. 4b). notably, pregabalin was ineffective in blocking
pain behavior in the mutant mice, whereas morphine produced a
similar analgesic effect in both mutant and wt mice (fig. 4b).

data from two experiments with similar expression levels have been
averaged, the current at ⫹5 mv was enhanced 3.22- ⫾ 0.42-fold by
wt ␣2-␦-1 (n ⫽ 15). the r217a ␣2-␦-1 produced a smaller
enhancement of  xxxg303xxx  currents at this potential (1.93- ⫾ 0.35-fold,
n ⫽ 14, p ⫽ 0.043 compared with wt ␣2-␦-1). this shows that the
reduced ability of r217a ␣2-␦-1 to enhance cav2.2兾␤1b currents
does not depend on the expression system. in further studies, robust
calcium currents were recorded from drg neurons isolated from
r217a mice, which were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to

mice developed punctate allodynia as measured by the application
of von frey filaments. this reached a peak 7 days after injury and
was maintained for at least 3 weeks (fig. 5a). a similar onset and
magnitude of pain behavior was seen in both the mutant and wt
mice (fig. 5a).
pregabalin (30–100 mg兾kg), gabapentin (100–300 mg兾kg), and
amitriptyline (4–12 mg兾kg) all produced dose-dependent inhibition
of the cci-induced punctate allodynia in the wt mice (fig. 5 b–d).
amitriptyline also produced a similar blockade of allodynia in the
mutant mice (fig. 5d). however, pregabalin and gabapentin
showed no efficacy in the mutant mice, which maintained pain
behaviors (punctate allodynia) similar to vehicle-treated controls
(fig. 5 b and c).
no abnormal phenotype was noted for the r217a mice during
these studies (see fig. 8 and supporting text, which are published
as supporting information on the pnas web site).
discussion
the key finding of this study is that the analgesic action of
pregabalin and gabapentin are mediated through the ␣2-␦-1 subunit
of vdccs. the mutation at position 217 prevents pregabalin from
binding to the ␣2-␦-1 subunit, without affecting the level of protein
expression. the mutation decreases the barium flux through calcium channels expressed in vitro, but the enhancement remains
statistically significant, and calcium currents measured in native
drgs were not affected. there is no overt phenotype displayed in
the r217a mutant, and its pain responses were normal. more
significantly, the mutation does not prevent the development of
allodynia after nerve injury. pregabalin possessed no analgesic
activity in the mutant against either chemically induced tonic pain
or nerve injury-induced chronic pain (similar behavioral data were
produced for gabapentin in the nerve-injury model). however,

typical binding patterns and analgesic responses were demonstrated
in littermate wt controls.
a mutation resulting in the substitution of a single amino acid at
position 217 of the ␣2 protein of ␣2-␦-1 subunit of vdccs significantly reduces the binding affinity of pregabalin. autoradiography
studies in the mutants reveal significant decrease in the density of
binding in the cortex medulla and spinal cord. western blot studies
confirm that this is not due to protein expression. significant
binding remains, and this is presumably due to the presence of
␣2-␦-2 (to which pregabalin also binds), especially in the cerebellum
and subcortical regions including the thalamus.
in expression systems examined to date, calcium channel complexes lacking the ␣2-␦ subunit have markedly reduced current
densities (22), at least in part because of a reduction in trafficking
(23). the present study shows that the mutation at position 217
results in a significant decrease in divalent cation current through
 xxxg303xxx  channels, presumably via an altered structural interaction
with the pore forming ␣1 complex. however, although the effect of
r217a ␣2-␦-1 was reduced, the enhancement remained statistically
significant in two different expression systems. it is possible that the
role of ␣2-␦ subunits on calcium current expression in native systems
17540 兩 www.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.0409066103

is less marked than suggested from expression studies. for example,
in du兾du and du2j兾du2j mice, the complete loss of ␣2-␦-2 results in
only about a 30% reduction in purkinje cell calcium channel
currents, although there is no compensation by other ␣2-␦ subunits
(24). furthermore, there is no reduction in somatic calcium channel
currents in heterozygotes, despite a partial loss of ␣2-␦-2 protein. in
contrast, in all expression systems examined, an ⬇4-fold enhancement by ␣2-␦-2 was observed (23, 24). therefore, it is possible that
whatever the nature of the dysfunction in r217a ␣2-␦-1, it retains
sufficient functionality such that in vivo it appears normal.
in this context, it is interesting to note that robust calcium
currents were recorded from drg neurons isolated from r217a
mice, which were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those
recorded from wt mouse drg (see fig. 7 and supporting text)
and exhibited properties as described previously for mouse drg
neurons (25). although we performed no detailed pharmacological
survey of calcium channel subtypes, the current–voltage relationships, thresholds, and kinetics of the currents suggested the presence of (at least) t-, n-, and l-type channels in both r217a and
wt cells (in accordance with published data from mouse drg
neurons—see ref. 26). the presence of the mutation did not seem
to impair calcium channel function, and we were unable to distinguish any differences in the ca2⫹ currents between the two populations of cells (see fig. 7 and supporting text).
a number of recent gene targeting studies knocking out various
subunits of vdccs demonstrate distinct changes in nociceptive
phenotype. deletions of the ␤3, ␣1b, and ␣1e subunits result in a
distinctly different pain phenotype in the knockout as compared
with wt controls (27–29). ducky mice, which contain a rearranged
␣2-␦-2 gene, have significant behavioral deficits including absence
epilepsy and cerebellar ataxia (24). however, no differences were
observed in the general behavioral phenotype between the r217a
mutant mice and wt mice, with no differences noted in weight gain
or in terms of general and fine motor coordination (see fig. 8 and
supporting text). unlike the calcium channel knockout mice,
r217a mutant mice demonstrate the same pain phenotype in
models of acute兾tonic and chronic pain as their wt littermates and
contain the same levels of ␣2-␦-1 protein in brain. moreover,
formalin and sciatic nerve injury induced the same intensity of
pain-related behaviors in both mutant and wt cohorts. formalin
typically produces a biphasic pain response with the first phase
thought to be mediated by direct activation of nociceptors and a
second phase mediated by the development of central sensitization
due to the ongoing afferent fiber activity and localized inflammation (30). injury to the sciatic nerve by application of loose ligations
induces punctate allodynia, a symptom that is also described by
patients with neuropathic pain (31). the onset of allodynia and
degree of hypersensitivity seen after sciatic nerve injury were
similar in both the mutant and wt mice.
pregabalin possessed no analgesic activity in the r217a mutant
mice against either chemically induced tonic pain or nerve injuryinduced chronic pain (similar behavioral data were produced for
gabapentin in the nerve-injury model). however, typical analgesic
responses were demonstrated in littermate wt controls with the
analgesic efficacy of pregabalin similar to that previously reported
(32–34). morphine and amitriptyline showed similar analgesic
actions in both the wt and mutant mice. taken together, these
data show that the r217a mutation does not alter the normal
responses to noxious stimuli or significantly change the mechanisms
driving neuropathic pain in these mice. moreover, they show that
‘‘non-␣2-␦’’ analgesia is retained in the mutant and provide confidence that the interpretation of any differences seen in behavioral
responses to ␣2-␦ ligands is not confounded by background strain
differences (35).
pregabalin and gabapentin are known to interact with both the
␣2-␦-1 and ␣2-␦-2 subunits (17) (t.-z.s., unpublished data). it has
been shown that ␣2-␦-1 is up-regulated in drg neurons after nerve
injury (36, 37) and that this correlates with the onset and duration

autoradiography. slides were allowed to air-dry at room temperature
for 1 h and preincubated in hepes兾koh (10 mm, ph 7.4) for 15
min at room temperature. adjacent sections were then incubated
for 30 min at room temperature in the same buffer containing 40
nm [3h]pregabalin [78 ci兾mmol (1 ci ⫽ 37 gbq); amersham
biosciences; custom synthesis) in the presence or absence of
gabapentin (10 ␮m) to define nonspecific binding. after the
incubation, the slides were washed three times for 1 min each in
nacl (100 mm at 4°c), dipped in ice-cold distilled water to remove
buffer salts, and air-dried overnight at room temperature.
dried sections were exposed to tritium hyperfilm (amersham
biosciences) for 1 month together with [3h] microscales (ranging
from 0.10–109.4 nci兾mg). quantitative densitometry analysis of
autoradiographs was performed by using the microcomputer imaging device (imaging research).
effect of wt ␣2-␦-1 and r217a ␣2-␦-1 on cav2.2兾␤1b currents. the
tsa-201 cells were transfected with cdnas for rabbit  xxxg303xxx  and rat
␤1b, both in the vector pmt2 (42), and either wt or r217a ␣2-␦-1
in pcdna3.1. the cdna for green fluorescent protein (mut3
gfp) (43) was included in the transfection to identify transfected
cells from which electrophysiological recordings were made. transfection was performed essentially as described in ref. 44, using a
ratio of 3:2:2:0.2 for  xxxg303xxx , ␤1b, ␣2-␦-1, and gfp, respectively.
when ␣2-␦-1 was omitted, it was substituted by pmt-2. calciumchannel expression in tsa-201 cells was investigated by whole-cell
patch clamp recording, essentially as described in ref. 45.
xenopus oocytes were prepared, injected, and used for two
electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology as described in ref. 23,
with the following exceptions. plasmid cdnas for the different
vdcc subunits  xxxg303xxx , ␣2-␦-1, and ␤1b were mixed in equivalent
weight ratios at 1 ␮g䡠␮l⫺1, and 9 nl was injected intranuclearly. the
recording solution for  xxxg303xxx -injected oocytes contained 10 mm
ba(oh)2, 70 mm naoh, 2 mm csoh, and 5 mm hepes (ph 7.4
with  xxxd390xxx  acid).
behavioral protocols. all studies were completed by an observer
blinded to genetic background of the mice and drug treatments and
in accordance with the united kingdom animals (scientific procedures) act (1986) and the internal pfizer ethical review policy. no
abnormal phenotype was noted during these studies (see fig. 8 and
supporting text).
formalin test. r217a ␣2-␦-1 mutant mice and wt mice were
administered pregabalin or gabapentin 1 h before testing and
morphine 30 min before testing. animals were habituated to the
perspex observation boxes 15 min before the administration of
formalin (20 ␮l of 5% wt兾vol) into the plantar surface of the left
hind paw. the time spent licking and biting the paw was recorded
in 5-min periods for 45 min. r217a ␣2-␦-1 mutant mice and wt
mice were randomly divided into three subgroups receiving various
treatments. all groups were administered drug treatments by s.c.
injection at a volume of 10 ml兾kg.
cci model. cci of the sciatic nerve was induced in r217a ␣2-␦-1
mutant mice and (n ⫽ 24 of each) wt mice based on methods
described in ref. 32. briefly, animals were placed in an anesthetic

pharmacology

of pain behavior. however, activity of pregabalin has been demonstrated in acute preparations (e.g., ref. 38) so that the functional
consequence of the up-regulation and its importance in clinical pain
states remains unknown. previous pharmacological investigations
have provided evidence that analgesic activity of pregabalin and
gabapentin is through the ␣2-␦ subunit. thus, enantiomeric pairs of
␣2-␦ ligands show affinity-related potency in animal models of pain
(13, 39), and structure–activity relationships in models of epilepsy,
anxiety, and pain, further demonstrate the importance of ␣2-␦
binding to activity for pregabalin and its analogues (40). the current
data are consistent with and add to these findings, demonstrating
that it is the ␣2-␦-1 subunit that provides the requirement for the
analgesic action of pregabalin and gabapentin.
neuropathic pain represents a significant therapeutic challenge,
and gabapentin shows clinical efficacy in a wide range of neuropathic pain conditions (41). pregabalin, the more potent newgeneration compound is the most widely studied medicine in
controlled clinical trials for neuropathic pain and represents an
important new therapy in this area. these data demonstrate that the
analgesic action of pregabalin is mediated through the ␣2-␦-1
subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels and firmly establish this
subunit as a target for pain control.

chamber and anesthetized with a 2% isoflurane o2 mixture. the
right hind thigh was shaved and swabbed with 1% iodine. animals
were then transferred to a homeothermic blanket for the duration
of the procedure, and anesthesia was maintained during surgery via
a nose cone. after an incision was made along the line of the thigh
bone, the common sciatic was exposed, and three suture ligatures
(4-0 silk) were tied around the nerve in a double knot. the incision
was closed in layers, and the wound was treated with topical
antibiotics.
the development of punctate allodynia was assessed over a
period of up to 20 days after surgery, and pharmacological studies
were carried out from 10 days after surgery once a stable allodynia
had been achieved. animals were habituated to the test cages (for
1 h) and to punctate stimulus before the start of each experiment.
on the test day, baseline readings of punctate allodynia were
recorded before drug treatment. animals were then randomly
divided into three subgroups receiving vehicle, pregabalin, or
amitriptyline treatments. all groups were administered drug treatments by s.c. injection at a volume of 10 ml兾kg. punctate allodynia
was reassessed at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h after drug treatments. the
experiment was carried out over 2 days, and the data were collated
at the end of the experiment.
punctate allodynia was evaluated by application of von frey
filaments (stoelting, wood dale, il) in ascending order of force
(0.008, 0.02, 0.04, 0.07, 0.16, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0, 1.4, 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0g) to

the plantar surface of hind paws. each filament was applied to the
paw for a maximum of 6 s or until a withdrawal response occurred.
once a withdrawal response was established, the paw was retested,
starting with the filament below the one that produced a withdrawal, and subsequently with the remaining filaments in descending order of force until no withdrawal occurred. the highest force
of 6 g lifted the paw in addition to eliciting a response and was taken
as the cut off point. both hind paws of each animal were tested in
this manner. the lowest amount of force required to elicit a
response was recorded as pwt in grams, with ranges expressed as
medians and quartiles and plotted on a log scale. a withdrawal
response to a stimulus of 0.04 g or less was defined as punctate
allodynia.
