abstract
objective: ischemic postconditioning protects the reperfused heart from infarction, and this protection is dependent on the occupancy of
adenosine receptors. we further explored the role of adenosine receptors in this salvage.
methods: in situ rabbit hearts underwent 30 min of regional ischemia and 3 h of reperfusion, and postconditioning was effected with four
cycles of 30-s reperfusion/30-s coronary artery occlusion at the end of ischemia.
results: postconditioning reduced infarct size from 40.2 t 3.4% of the risk zone in untreated hearts to 15.5 t 2.5%. protection by
postconditioning was blocked by either the non-selective adenosine receptor blocker 8-p-(sulfophenyl)theophylline or the a2b-selective
antagonist mrs 1754, injected intravenously 5 min before reperfusion. the protein kinase c (pkc) antagonist chelerythrine also aborted
postconditioning’s salvage, indicating a pkc-dependent mechanism. neither the a1-selective antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine
nor the a2a-selective antagonist 8-(13-chlorostyryl)caffeine had an effect on protection. the non-selective but a2b-potent adenosine agonist
5v-(n-ethylcarboxamido)adenosine (neca) infused from 5 min before to 1 h after reperfusion mimicked postconditioning’s effect on infarct
size (17.2 t 2.7% infarction) and mrs 1754 blocked the neca-induced cardioprotection, confirming that a2b activation was protective. the
pkc activator  xxxd2925xxx  delivered just before reperfusion also duplicated the protective effect of postconditioning
(16.3 t 4.1% infarction), and co-administration of the pkc antagonist chelerythrine aborted pma’s protection, confirming that the protection
was the result of pkc activation. neca’s protective effect was not affected by chelerythrine, but rather mrs 1754 blocked pma’s salutary
effect (42.8 t 1.0% infarction), suggesting that the  xxxg83xxx ’s effect is under control of pkc. finally,  xxxd3536xxx , a blocker of
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, also abrogated protection by pma.
conclusions: salvage of ischemic myocardium by postconditioning is dependent on activation of a2b receptors, which in turn depends on
activation of pkc. it is still unclear why pkc activation is required to make the heart’s adenosine become protective.

recently, it has been shown that the canine heart can be
effectively protected from infarction with brief cycles of
ischemia and reperfusion during the early reperfusion period
following a lethal ischemic insult, a phenomenon termed
postconditioning [1]. we were also able to demonstrate
sparing of infarction by postconditioning in hearts of open-

chest rabbits and showed that this protection was dependent
on signal transduction elements leading to  xxxd2738xxx  (no)
production, erk activation and opening of the mitochondrial  xxxg1253xxx  [2]. tsang et al. [3] extended those
observations in a rat model and showed that postconditioning protects myocardium by activating the prosurvival
kinases phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( xxxg1743xxx -k), akt, and
p70s6k.
it is not known what triggers these pathways in the
postconditioned heart. one obvious candidate is adenosine
which we have previously shown activates  xxxg1743xxx -k to
increase akt phosphorylation in the rabbit heart [4].
furthermore, like postconditioning, protection from the
adenosine agonist neca has been shown to also be dependent on  xxxg1743xxx -k, erk and no [5]. indeed, we [6] and
kin et al. [7] reported that postconditioning’s cardioprotection in an isolated rabbit heart model can be blocked by
the non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist 8-p-(sulfophenyl)theophylline (spt). ischemic preconditioning was
also found to be dependent on adenosine receptor stimulation in the reperfusion phase following the index ischemia
[8]. moreover in that study we presented evidence that the
 xxxg83xxx  subtype was largely responsible for
preconditioning’s protection and that the a2a subtype was
not. although kin et al. [7] concluded that a2a receptors
were responsible for postconditioning’s protection,
zm241385, the antagonist they used, is not highly selective
between a2a and a2b receptors and it is possible that their
conclusion may have been erroneous. we therefore
designed experiments to determine whether the  xxxg83xxx 
subtype might be responsible for postconditioning’s protection. in addition, we also explored the mechanism
whereby postconditioning causes adenosine receptors to
become protective.

preparation arterial po2 averages 180 – 200mm hg and
pco2 25 – 30 mm hg. a pe 50 catheter filled with
heparinized saline (10 u/ml) was placed in the right carotid
artery to monitor arterial blood pressure and to measure
arterial ph and gases. to administer drugs, a pe 50 catheter
filled with heparinized saline was placed in an ear vein.
after a left thoracotomy, a prominent branch of the left
coronary artery was surrounded with a suture (2– 0 silk) to
form a snare. the rabbits were allowed to stabilize for
15 min after surgery before the protocols were begun.
2.2. protocols
hearts of 21 experimental groups experienced 30 min of
regional ischemia (fig. 1). in all hearts reperfusion
following the occlusion lasted for 3h. control hearts had
only the index occlusion followed by reperfusion. in all
postconditioned groups, four cycles of 30-s reperfusion/30-s
occlusion were started immediately after release of the index
ischemia. in drug-treated animals spt (7.5 mg/kg), mrs
1754 (9.5 ag/kg), an adenosine a2b-selective antagonist, 8cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (dpcpx, 1mg/kg), a selective a1 adenosine receptor antagonist, chelerythrine
(5 mg/kg), a highly selective antagonist of protein kinase
c (pkc), or  xxxd3536xxx  (60 ag/kg), an inhibitor of  xxxg1743xxx -k,
was infused as an intravenous bolus 5 min before the onset
of reperfusion with or without subsequent postconditioning
cycles. a 6-min infusion of 8-(13-chlorostyryl)caffeine

2. methods
all procedures were approved by the institutional
animal care and use committee and were conducted in
accordance with recommendations published in the guide
for care and use of laboratory animals [9].
2.1. surgical procedure
new zealand white rabbits of either sex weighing
between 1.7 and 2.7kg were anesthetized with intravenous
sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg). throughout the experiment additional anesthesia was administered as needed (5 –
15 mg pentobarbital/15 min). a heating pad maintained
rectal temperature between 38.5 and 39.5-c. animals were
intubated through a tracheotomy and ventilated with 100%
o2 with the aid of a mechanical ventilator. arterial ph, po2,
and pco2 were measured with blood gas analyzer abl 5
(radiometer, copenhagen, denmark). respiratory rate was
adjusted to keep ph between 7.35 and 7.45. in this

(csc, 660 ag/kg), a selective  xxxg82xxx 
antagonist, was started 11 min before the onset of reperfusion and was also combined with postconditioning.
neca (2ag/kg), a non-selective but potent a2b adenosine agonist, was infused 5 min before the onset of
reperfusion. after administration of the bolus, an infusion
of 0.2ag/kg/min was continued for 65 min. to investigate if
the  xxxg83xxx  were responsible for the effects
of neca, we administered a bolus of mrs 1754 (9.5 ag/
kg) at the same time as neca 5 min before the onset of
reperfusion and again after 15 min of reperfusion. to
determine whether pkc activation was critical to neca’s
effect on ischemic myocardium, chelerythrine (5mg/kg) was
infused as an intravenous bolus 5 min before the onset of
reperfusion.
the effect of a left atrial infusion of the pkc activator
 xxxd2925xxx  (pma) (0.5 ag/kg/min)
beginning 5 min before reperfusion and extending for
20 min in lieu of neca was examined. co-infusion of
either chelerythrine or mrs 1754 as detailed above was also
tested in 2 other groups of rabbit hearts.
finally, the effects of the tool drugs themselves, spt,
mrs 1754, dpcpx, csc, chelerythrine, and  xxxd3536xxx 
infused 5 min before reperfusion were evaluated.
doses of drugs were selected mainly because of our prior
experience of effective action or blockade. dpcpx at a dose
of 1 mg/kg had previously been shown to block the negative
chronotropic effect of the selective  xxxg81xxx 
agonists 2-chloro-n 6 -cyclopentyladenosine [10] and
gr79236 [11]. preliminary observations with csc demonstrated that a dose of 660 ag/kg infused over 6 min
completely prevented the hypotensive effect of an intravenous infusion of 0.4 mg/kg/min adenosine.

2.4. chemicals
 xxxd3536xxx , chelerythrine, pma, spt, neca, mrs
1754, csc, and dpcpx were obtained from sigma
chemical co. (st. louis, mo). they were dissolved in
dmso. the solution was then further diluted in 1.5 ml of
0.9% saline before administration to the rabbit. this amount
of dmso had no effect in control hearts.
2.5. statistics
all data are expressed as mean t s.e.m. one-way
analysis of variance (anova) combined with tukey’s post
hoc test was performed on baseline hemodynamic and
infarct data. temporal differences in hemodynamic variables in any given group were analyzed with one-way
repeated measures anova, and tukey’s post hoc test was
used to examine differences between measurements at any
given time point and baseline. differences were considered
to be significant if the p value was below 0.05.

3. results
3.1. hemodynamics
no group differences in heart rate, developed pressure, or
coronary flow were observed at baseline (table 1 in the
online supplement). no substantial changes in heart rate or
blood pressure were observed after administration of drugs.
blood pressure declined mildly during coronary occlusion
in all groups.

2.3. determination of area at risk and infarct size
after completion of the studies all in situ hearts were
excised and the aortic root was perfused with 0.9% saline.
the coronary artery was reoccluded, and 2 –9 am diameter
green fluorescent microspheres (duke scientific corp., palo
alto, ca) were infused into the perfusate to demarcate the
ischemic zone as the area of tissue without fluorescence
(region at risk). hearts were weighed, frozen, and then cut
into 2-mm-thick transverse slices. the slices were incubated
in 1% triphenyltetrazolium chloride (ttc) in sodium
phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) at 38 -c for 8min. ttc stains
the noninfarcted myocardium brick red indicating the
presence of dehydrogenase enzymes. the slices were then
immersed in 10% formalin to enhance the contrast between
stained (viable) and unstained (necrotic) tissue. the risk
zone was revealed as the non-fluorescent region by
illumination with uv light. the areas of infarct and risk
zone were determined by planimetry of each slice and
volumes were calculated by multiplying each area by its
slice thickness and summing them for each heart. infarct
size is expressed as a percentage of the risk zone.

although there was some variability in heart weights and
risk zone volumes in the groups (table 2 in the online
supplement), there were no significant differences. in
control hearts infarct size was 40.2 t 3.4% of the risk zone
(fig. 2). infarct size in the postconditioned group was nearly
70% less than that in the control group (15.5 t 2.5%,
p < 0.001 versus control). spt, a non-selective adenosine
receptor blocker, aborted protection confirming the involvement of adenosine receptors. furthermore mrs 1754, a
highly selective  xxxg83xxx  antagonist, also
blocked postconditioning’s protection, thus identifying the

 xxxg83xxx  subtype as being responsible for postconditioning’s protection. neither dpcpx nor csc, highly selective
a1 and a2a antagonists, respectively, blocked postconditioning’s protection, thus making involvement of the a1- and a2areceptors unlikely.
we next examined whether pkc activation played a role
in postconditioning’s protection. as demonstrated in fig. 3,
chelerythrine blocked salvage of ischemic myocardium
(42.6 t 3.0% infarction). additionally  xxxd3536xxx , an antagonist of  xxxg1743xxx -k, also aborted postconditioning’s protective
effect (35.1 t 4.6% infarction).
it was reasoned that if postconditioning protects by
activating a2b receptors then administration of an a2b
agonist should mimic the protection. fig. 4 shows that an
infusion of the non-selective but a2b-potent adenosine
receptor agonist neca beginning just before reperfusion
significantly decreased infarction to 17.2 t 2.7% of the risk
zone ( p < 0.001 vs. control). as predicted by our hypothesis
this protection was aborted when a2b receptors were
blocked by mrs 1754, thus documenting the importance
of  xxxg83xxx  occupancy which is presumably the first step
in neca’s signaling. chelerythrine had no effect when
protection was initiated by neca, thus excluding pkc as a
necessary step in neca’s downstream signaling pathway.
next we tried to activate cardiac pkc by directly infusing
pma into the rabbit just prior to reperfusion and found that it
was equally protective as neca (16.3 t 4.1% infarction)
(fig. 5). chelerythrine blocked pma’s salutary effect, thus
supporting our assumption that pma protected by activating
pkc. the a2b blocker mrs 1754 also blocked pma’s protection indicating that pkc activation acts to control adenosine’s activation of the  xxxg83xxx  in the signaling cascade.
finally,  xxxd3536xxx  also abrogated pma’s protection.

5v-(n-ethylcarboxamido)adenosine (neca) administered 5 min before

other hand, chelerythrine (chel) administered just before reperfusion failed
to affect neca’s protection. *p < 0.001 vs. control.

none of the tool drugs administered at reperfusion had
any independent effect on infarct size (figs. 2 and 3).

4. discussion
these studies implicate involvement of the adenosine
 xxxg83xxx  in postconditioning’s signaling pathways in our
rabbit model. furthermore for the first time we provide
evidence that pkc activation is upstream of the critical
binding of adenosine a2b receptors. these observations
provide a link back to pkc which for many years has been a
pivotal kinase in the protection from ischemic preconditioning [12,13].
although ischemic preconditioning introduced almost 20
years ago is a powerful anti-infarct intervention [14], it has
not been possible to apply it in patients with acute
myocardial infarction because of the requirement for
pretreatment. furthermore, restoration of blood flow to
ischemic myocardium, a requisite for long-term survival of
tissue, appears to hasten the transition from ischemic but
viable to necrotic myocardium [15 – 18]. zhao et al. [1]
provided a new tool for protection of the heart from
ischemia/reperfusion injury when they introduced the
concept of postconditioning. because of its timing postconditioning could be applied in a clinical setting of
reperfusion by direct angioplasty, and indeed a recent clinical
trial of postconditioning yielded encouraging results [19].
because a highly selective a2b antagonist blocked
postconditioning’s protection we tested whether an a2b agonist would mimic the protection. unfortunately a selective
a2b agonist is unavailable. although not selective for any
adenosine receptor, neca is a very potent  xxxg83xxx 
agonist, and is frequently employed to activate this receptor
subtype. as previously demonstrated in isolated rabbit
hearts [5], neca was quite protective in in situ hearts.
therefore, it was not surprising that blockade of a2b
receptors with mrs 1754 aborted neca’s protection.
because pkc is known to play an important mediator role
in preconditioning, and because a pkc antagonist blocked
postconditioning’s protection in the present study, we tested
whether this intracellular kinase would also be important in
neca’s signaling. to our surprise it was not, suggesting
that pkc resides upstream of the step where the postconditioned heart employs a2b receptors in its protective
pathway.
we pursued the above hypothesis by testing whether
activating pkc with pma would be protective. intraatrial
pma just prior to reperfusion was equally protective as
neca. we excluded the possibility that pma was protecting ischemic myocardium through some unknown, nonspecific effect by documenting abolition of pma’s salvage with
the highly selective pkc antagonist chelerythrine. the
observation that blockade of a2b receptors with mrs 1754
also prevented pma from sparing ischemic myocardium
corroborated our hypothesis that pkc resides upstream of

the a2b step in this pathway. therefore, we propose that
pkc activation by postconditioning somehow facilitates the
activation of protective signal transduction pathways that
are coupled to the  xxxg83xxx .
kin et al. [7] recently reported that adenosine receptors
were involved in a rat model of postconditioning, but they
concluded that it was the a2a and  xxxg84xxx  subtypes that
were important. amp579, an adenosine a1/a2 agonist, is
quite protective when delivered just prior to or at
reperfusion, and its cardioprotection was not affected by
the potent and selective a1 adenosine receptor antagonist
dpcpx (k i = 10 nm for a1 and 1440 nm for a2 receptors),
but was effectively abrogated by the adenosine a2a
antagonist 8-(13-chlorostyryl) caffeine (csc) which is
520-fold more selective for a2a than a1 receptors [20,21].
yet we were unable to duplicate its protection with the
highly selective a2a agonist cgs21680 [21]. these
observations led us to suspect the  xxxg83xxx  might be
the important one since neca, a very similar compound
with known adenosine a2b agonist potency, mimicked
amp579’s protection [21] (no a2b affinity data are available
for amp579). kin et al. [7] used zm241385 to block a2a
receptors in their rat hearts. however, if the affinity of rat
receptors for zm241385 is similar to that of cloned human
adenosine receptors [22], then nearly all a2b receptors
would also have been blocked as well at the dose used by
kin et al. we were unable to find affinity data for
zm241385 against rat a2b receptors.
affinity studies for mrs 1754 have been performed for
human and rat, but unfortunately not for rabbit, adenosine
receptors [23]. the k i for ha2b is 1.97 nm which is more
than 200-fold lower than that for either  xxxd951xxx  or ha2a
receptors. however, the k i for rat a1 receptors is 16.8 nm,
only 8.5 times that for ha2b receptors. because of the
possible collateral effect of mrs 1754 on a1 receptors in
the rabbit, we specifically examined the result of dpcpx
administration at a dose known to block the heart rate effects
of a highly selective adenosine a1 agonist in rabbits [10,11].
indeed, the a2b antagonist mrs 1754, but not the a1
antagonist dpcpx, aborted postconditioning’s protection,
strongly suggesting that cardioprotection from postconditioning in the open-chest rabbit requires occupancy of a2b
receptors during reperfusion. our observations with csc
exclude involvement of the  xxxg82xxx . unfortunately,
there is no selective a3 antagonist in the rabbit. interestingly, kilpatrick et al. [24] have shown that dpcpx blocks
cardioprotection triggered by  xxxg84xxx  stimulation in
rabbit hearts. because of the inability of dpcpx to block
postconditioning’s protection, a role for a3 receptors is
doubtful.
olanrewaju and mustafa [25] have demonstrated in
coronary artery endothelial cells that occupancy of both
adenosine a2a and a2b receptors stimulates no production
and increases cgmp levels. we have already shown that
cardioprotection triggered by neca at reperfusion in vitro
[5] as well as postconditioning [2] are dependent on no.

s. philipp et al. / cardiovascular research 70 (2006) 308 – 314

mitochondrial katp opening has also been implicated in
postconditioning [2]. increased pkg activation resulting
from an increased cgmp level would be expected, and we
have recently reported that activated pkg can open
mitochondrial katp [26].
tsang et al. [3] reported that  xxxg1743xxx -k is an important
signaling step in postconditioning in the isolated rat heart.
we now confirm this observation in the in situ heart, and
also show that pma’s protection is effectively blocked by
 xxxd3536xxx . previously, we had noted that salvage triggered
by neca infused shortly before reperfusion was blocked by
 xxxd3536xxx  [5]. furthermore, neca increased akt phosphorylation. therefore, adenosine receptor occupancy
results in  xxxg1743xxx -k activation and akt phosphorylation,
although the intermediate steps are not yet known.
it is unclear why only the a2b receptors appear to protect
the postconditioned heart. the untreated heart produces and
releases adenosine during the prolonged coronary occlusion,
and, therefore, one might wonder why these hearts are not
protected. the  xxxg83xxx  is a very low-affinity receptor
and the adenosine concentration even during ischemia may
not be sufficient to populate this receptor to the degree
required for protection. neca, on the other hand, is a more
potent agonist of the critical  xxxg83xxx . kin et al. [7]
measured adenosine in the effluent of their postconditioned
hearts and found it to be decreased. they proposed that the
postconditioned heart might somehow be retaining adenosine in the tissues, but the mechanism for this is
unprecedented. perhaps postconditioning somehow activates pathways that increase the affinity of the receptors
so that they can be occupied by the heart’s endogenous
adenosine. indeed, pkc activation has been reported to
increase a2b responses in some cell systems [27,28] and we
now find that pkc activation is required for postconditioning to elicit protection. although pkc may activate a
myriad of kinases, an intriguing possibility is that it
phosphorylates the  xxxg83xxx  to increase its sensitivity.
inagaki et al. [29,30] have reported that specific
inhibition of pkc-y at reperfusion decreases infarct size.
our present observation that pkc activation at reperfusion
is protective is obviously not consistent with that paradigm.
perhaps activation of all isoforms by pma activates a
previously unsuspected protective isoform, while inhibition
of all isoforms with chelerythrine blocks some additional
protective isoform resulting in the deleterious effect that we
observed.
in conclusion, our study demonstrates for the first time
that at least some protective strategies introduced shortly
before reperfusion and ischemic postconditioning are acting
through the  xxxg83xxx . furthermore, binding of
the  xxxg83xxx  at reperfusion results in activation of at
least one prosurvival kinase,  xxxg1743xxx -k. finally, pkc must also
be activated during postconditioning to elicit protection,
perhaps by increasing the sensitivity of the a2b adenosine
receptor. hence, pkc activation is upstream of  xxxg83xxx 
occupancy.
