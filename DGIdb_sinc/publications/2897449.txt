to relate to body weight of the animal, it did not yield any
significant correlation with cl,. therefore, the present results
suggest that the age-dependence in the first-pass pulmonary
clearance of propranolol may not be largely related to the agedependent lung blood flow, but predominantly to the immaturity and senescence in pulmonary uptake capacity which has
been proposed to be relatively high by iwamoto et al (1987a).

agonist profile of  xxxd2021xxx  ( xxxd2021xxx ) on a population of
post synaptic a-adrenoceptors

abstract- xxxd2021xxx  (0.02-5 pf)produced concentration-related
contractions of the mouse anococcygeus muscle, which were
unaffected by cocaine (2 pm) or by pretreatment of mice with 6hydroxydopamine. contractions were reduced by a-adrenoceptor
antagonists; the rank order of potency was  xxxd3000xxx  >  xxxd2914xxx  > yohimbine. with phenoxybenzamine as antagonist, the
estimated dissociation constant (kd)for  xxxd2021xxx  was 0.41 l(m. it
is concluded that  xxxd2021xxx  causes direct activation of postsynaptic a,-adrenoceptors, and it is suggested that it acts on the same
subtype of the receptor as imidazoline agonists.
 xxxd2021xxx  ( xxxd2021xxx ) is used therapeutically in the management of postpartum haemorrhage and, more controversially, as
a diagnostic agent for the detection of variant forms of angina
(editorial 1982). in both cases, the relevant pharmacological
property is smooth muscle contraction, either of the uterus or
the coronary arteries. however, the nature of the receptors
activated by  xxxd2021xxx , and in particular the role of aadrenoceptors, remains a matter of contention (muller-schweinitzer & weidmann 1978; sakanashi & yonemura 1980;
brazenor & angus 1981). experiments on neural tissue have
suggested that  xxxd2021xxx  may act as a partial agonist on azadrenoceptors (marshall et al 1977; brown & caulfield 1979),
but few studies have focussed on a-adrenoceptor interactions on
smooth muscle. apart from the uterus and coronary arteries,
 xxxd2021xxx  is generally considered to have little contractile
effect on smooth muscle (bowman & rand 1980). however,
during an investigation of a-adrenoceptor function in the mouse
anococcygeus muscle, it was found that  xxxd2021xxx  produced
strong contractions which were reduced by  xxxd2914xxx ,
suggesting a-adrenoceptor activation (gibson unpublished
observation). in the present communication, we examine these
contractions in more detail. in particular, the experiments were

designed to clarify two points. first, the anococcygeus muscle is
very sensitive to contraction by indirect sympathomimetics
(gillespie 1981; gibson & wedmore 1981) and therefore
experiments were carried out to determine whether ergometrineinduced contractions of the mouse anococcygeus were direct or
indirect. secondly, the nature of the a-adrenoceptor activated by
 xxxd2021xxx  was determined.

methods
male mice (laca strain; 25-35 g) were killed by stunning and
exsanguination. the paired anococcygeus muscles were
dissected out and set up in series, joined at the ventral bar, in
1 ml glass organ baths containing krebs-bicarbonate solution
(composition mm:nacl 118.1; kci 4.7; mgs04 1.0; kh2p04
1.2; caclz 2.5; nahc03 25.0; glucose 11.1) maintained at 37Â°c
and gassed continuously with 95% 02:5% coz. a resting
tension of 200-400 mg was placed on the tissue and changes in
tension recorded with a grass f t 0 3 fore-displacement transducer attached to a lectromed pen-recorder. muscles were
allowed to equilibrate for 45 min before the experiment was
begun.
 xxxd2021xxx  was added to the organ bath in volumes not
exceeding 50 p l and was left in contact with the tissue for 5 min
or until any consequent rise in tone had reached a peak.
following washout, further concentrations of agonist were not
added until muscle tone had returned to baseline. pd2 values
(-log of the molar concentration of agonist producing 50% of
the maximum response, ariens & van rossum 1957) were
calculated by regression analysis of the straight line portion of
the concentration-response curve (between 20-80% of the
maximum response).
antagonist drugs of the competitive type ( xxxd3000xxx ,  xxxd2914xxx , yohimbine) were added to the krebs reservoir a t the
appropriate concentration and were in contact with the tissue for
30 min before testing their effect on  xxxd2021xxx  sensitivity.

antagonist pa2 values were calculated by regression analysis of
schild plots (arunlakshana & schild 1959) obtained by repeating  xxxd2021xxx  concentration-response curves in the presence
of increasing concentrations of antagonist. three concentrations of antagonist were studied on each tissue (only one
antagonist per preparation), the concentration range being at
least ten-fold. in control experiments, it was found that up to
four  xxxd2021xxx  concentration-response curves could be
repeated without significant alteration in sensitivity. no
blockers of uptake processes or of b-adrenoceptors were present;
early experiments revealed that  xxxd2021xxx  was not subject to
neuronal uptake (see results), and neither extraneuronal uptake
nor b-adrenoceptors are important influences in the mouse
anococcygeus (gibson & wedmore 1981).
the dissociation constant (kd) for  xxxd2021xxx  was calculated by the method of furchgott (1966). after determination of
a control concentration-response curve, tissues were incubated
with phenoxybenzamine (10-100 nm) for 10 min, and then
washed repeatedly for 1 h. a second  xxxd2021xxx  concentrationresponse curve was then constructed which was to the right of
the first, with depressed slope and maximum response. regression analysis of the plot of ]/[a] upon i/[a'], where a and a'
represent equieffectiveconcentrations of  xxxd2021xxx  before and
after phenoxybenzamine incubation, respectively, yielded an
estimate of kd from the equation, kd= (slope - i)/intercept.
some animals were pretreated with 6-hydroxydopamine (6ohda; 2 x 50 mg kg-' on day 1, 2 x 100 mg kg-' on day 4,
muscle sensitivity measured on day 5). this treatment schedule
has been shown to produce an effective sympathectomy of the
mouse anococcygeus (gibson & wedmore 1981).
drugs used were:  xxxd1736xxx  (may & baker);
 xxxd2021xxx  maleate (sigma); 6-hydroxydopamine hydrobromide (sigma); phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride (smith, kline
& french);  xxxd2914xxx  (ciba);  xxxd3000xxx  hydrochloride (pfizer); yohimbine hydrochloride (aldrich).
statistical analysis was by student's r-test.
results
 xxxd2021xxx  (0.02-5 pm) produced concentration-related, sustained contractions of the mouse anococcygeus; peak tension
increases for each concentration occurred within 3 min and were
readily reversed by washout (fig. 1). analysis of several such
concentration-response curves gave an ec5o of 0.33 pm and a

maximum tension increase of 660 mg (table i); the maximum
response to  xxxd2021xxx  is therefore similar to responses previously recorded for other sympathomimetic drugs in this tissue
(gibson & yu 1983). the parameters of the concentrationresponse curve to  xxxd2021xxx  were unchanged in the presence of
cocaine (2 pm) or in muscles from mice pretreated with 6-ohda
(table 1).
 xxxd2021xxx -induced contractions were reduced by a-adrenoceptor antagonists. the order of potency, in terms of the pa2
values, was  xxxd3000xxx  >  xxxd2914xxx  > yohimbine (table 2). in
all three cases the slope of the schild plot did not differ from
unity.

using phenoxybenzamine (furchgott 1966),the estimated kd
value for  xxxd2021xxx  was 0.41 pm; indeed, there was no
value
significant difference (p>0.05) between the ~ k d
(6.39 f0.14 n = 5) and the pd2 value (6.48 f0.03 n = 9, table 1).

discussion
pretreatment of mice with 6-ohda has been shown to reduce
greatly the contractions of the anococcygeus to indirectly acting
sympathomimetics (gibson & wedmore 1981);in addition, such
pretreatment, and incubation of the muscle with cocaine,
potentiates responses to sympathomimetics which are inactivated by uptake into the presynaptic nerve terminals (gibson &
wedmore 1981; gibson & yu 1983). in the present study, it was
found that neither 6-ohda pretreatment nor cocaine had any
effect on contractions of the anococcygeus to  xxxd2021xxx ; thus,
 xxxd2021xxx -induced responses are due to direct activation of
postsynaptic a-adrenoceptors and are not subject to modulation
by neuronal uptake. although it has been suggested that 10 pm
cocaine might produce a non-selective potentiation of agonist
responses in the rat anococcygeus, via a post-junctional mechanism (doggrell & waldron 1982), the present results seem to
confirm that, in the mouse anococcygeus, 2 pm cocaine does not
cause a widespread enhancement of responses, but rather
potentiates only those agonists which are removed from the
biophase by the presynaptic amine pump (gibson & wedmore
1981; gibson & yu 1983). in terms of the ec50,  xxxd2021xxx  is
5-10 times less potent than noradrenaline (after uptake block) in
causing contractions of the mouse anococcygeus, although the
maximum responses produced by the two agonists are similar
(gibson & yu 1983). since the pkd value for  xxxd2021xxx  did
not differ from the pd2 value, it seems that there are few, if any,
spare receptors for the drug in the tissue.
as expected, responses to  xxxd2021xxx  were reduced by aadrenoceptor antagonists. the order of potency of the antagonists ( xxxd3000xxx  >  xxxd2914xxx  > yohimbine) and their respective pa2 values suggests that  xxxd2021xxx  acts on a,-adrenoceptors (timmermans & van zweiten 1981). however, three recent
reports have suggested that the a,-adrenoceptor population of
the mouse anococcygeus may consist of two sub-types, one
interacting with phenethylamines (noradrenaline, phenylephrine) and the other with imidazolines (oxymetazoline,  xxxd2698xxx ). first, coates & weetman (1982) showed that phenoxybenzamine was a more potent antagonist of the imidazole
derivative, sgd 101/75, than of noradrenaline. secondly, large
(1983) found that contractions of the mouse anococcygeus
induced by noradrenaline were generally accompanied by

communications

membrane depolarization, whereas those induced by  xxxd2698xxx  were not. finally, gibson & yu (1983) demonstrated that,
while yohimbine was equieffective as an antagonist against
phenethylamines and imidazolines, both  xxxd3000xxx  and  xxxd2914xxx  could differentiate between the two agonist groups in
terms of their respective pa2 values. we have therefore compared the pa2 values against  xxxd2021xxx  obtained in the present
study with those against noradrenaline and oxymetazoline
obtained by gibson & yu (1983; table 3). clearly, the
antagonist profile against  xxxd2021xxx  is the same as that against
oxymetazoline, suggesting that  xxxd2021xxx  interacts with the
imidazoline subtype.

to conclude, the results have shown that  xxxd2021xxx  causes
contraction of the mouse anococcygeus muscle by a direct
activation of post-synaptic a,-adrenoceptors, and the pa2 values
obtained with  xxxd3000xxx ,  xxxd2914xxx , and yohimbine strongly
indicate that  xxxd2021xxx  interacts with a specific sub-type of the
at-adrenoceptor previously identified as the site of interaction
for imidazolines. a similar interaction between  xxxd2021xxx  and
imidazoline sites on blood vessels might provide an explanation
for the actions of the drug on coronary arteries. both  xxxd2021xxx  (kawachi et al 1984; suyama & kuriyama 1984) and
imidazolines (egleme et al 1984) produce stronger contractions
of blood vessels after removal of endothelial cells; these cells
release relaxant factors which offset the direct contractile effects
of a variety of drugs on vascular smooth muscle (bullock et al
1986). it may be that the increased sensitivity of coronary

i39

arteries to  xxxd2021xxx  observed in patients with variant angina
(editorial 1982; freedman et al 1984; mata bourcart et al 1985)
may reflect a change in the balance between these relaxant
factors and the smooth muscle imidazoline receptors in diseased
arteries.
