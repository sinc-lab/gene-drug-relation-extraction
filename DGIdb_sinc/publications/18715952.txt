tumor-growth–promoting  xxxg1884xxx 
 xxxd1903xxx  pathway provides
medulloblastoma therapeutic targets

 xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) has been shown to play important roles in several aspects of tumor development and
progression. pge2 is synthesized from  xxxd208xxx 
by cyclooxygenases (cox) and  xxxd1903xxx  synthases
( xxxg1876xxx ) and mediates its biological activity through binding to the four prostanoid receptors ep1 through  xxxg1875xxx . in
this study, we show for the first time that medulloblastoma (mb), the most common malignant childhood brain
tumor, expresses high levels of cox-2, microsomal  xxxg1876xxx -1, and ep1 through  xxxg1875xxx  and secretes
pge 2 . pge 2 and the ep 2 receptor agonist butaprost
stimulated mb cell proliferation. treatment of mb cells
with cox inhibitors suppressed pge2 production and
induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. similarly, specific
cox-2 silencing by small interfering rna inhibited mb
cell growth. ep1 and  xxxg1874xxx  antagonists ono8713 and ono-ae3-240, but not the  xxxg1875xxx  antagonists
ono-ae3-208 and  xxxd1097xxx , inhibited tumor cell proliferation, indicating the significance of ep1 and ep3 but
not  xxxg1875xxx  for mb growth. administration of cox inhibitors at clinically achievable nontoxic concentrations significantly inhibited growth of established human mb
xenografts. apoptosis was increased, proliferation was

important for mb growth and that therapies targeting
the prostanoid metabolic pathway are potentially bene­

edulloblastoma (mb), an embryonic tumor of
the cerebellum with high tendency to metastasize, is the most frequent malignant embryonal cms tumor of childhood.1 advances in treatment
regimens have improved the 5-year survival rates for
standard-risk patients to approximately 70%. however,
the prognosis for patients with high-risk mb remains
poor, and long-term survivors frequently show detrimental physical and neuropsychological sequelae.2,3
increased levels of prostaglandin  xxxd2037xxx  (pge 2) have
been detected in a variety of malignancies, including
brain tumors.4–7 pge 2 is synthesized from arachidonic

receptors were detected by incubating tumor sections
with rabbit anti-ep1, anti-ep 2 , anti-ep3, and anti- xxxg1875xxx 
(cayman chemicals), respectively, overnight at 4°c.
the superpicture polymer detection kit with appropriate
secondary antibodies was used together with a diaminobenzidine (dab) substrate chromogen system to visualize immunopositivity (zymed).
active caspase-3 expression in human mb xenografts
isolated from nmri nu/nu mice was investigated by
incubating sections overnight at 4°c with a monoclonal
rabbit antibody specifically detecting active caspase-3
(r&d systems, abingdon, uk). proliferation was
detected using a specific ki-67 (sp6) antibody (neomarkers, fremont, ca, usa). immunopositivity was visualized as described above. as a control for nonspecific
background staining, corresponding sections were incubated with antimouse immunoglobulin g (igg) isotype
or antirabbit igg isotype controls (zymed). caspase-3
activation in tumor sections was quanitified by counting
the number of tumor cells staining positive for the active
caspase-3 antibody in six representative regions of the
tumor section. proliferation was assessed by counting
the number of ki-67 positively staining nuclei and total
number of cancer cells at 3200 magnification, in six
representative regions. for caspase-3 and ki-67 staining,
the results are expressed as the proportion of positively
staining cells over the total number of cells.
biotinylated bandeiraea simplicifolia-1 (bs-1) lectin
(sigma-aldrich, solna, sweden) was used to visualize
endothelial cells. bs-1 was diluted 1:50 and incubated
overnight at 4°c. cells were detected with abcomplex
conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (dako a /s,
glostrup, denmark). sections were developed using
dab (sk-4100, vector laboratories inc., burlingame,
ca, usa). four tumor slides per treatment group and
four fields per slide were quantified for microvessel density at 3200 magnification. the results are expressed as
an average number of microvessels per field.

all tumor tissue samples used in this study were collected at the department of oncology and pathology,
karolinska university hospital (stockholm, sweden),
between 1994 and 2005. the diagnoses were confirmed
by histological assessment of specimens according to
who classification criteria.1 tumor and patient characteristics are summarized in table 1. briefly, a total of 40
specimens from 39 patients 0–47 years of age (21 males;
31 of the patients were 0–18 years of age) were investigated. five of the samples were classified as supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors (spnets). of the
39 patients, 12 had died of their disease (0–31 months
from surgery), and 27 had no evidence of disease at the
last follow-up (13–30 months from surgery). eleven
patients had metastatic disease, of which six were alive
at the last follow-up.
ethical approval was obtained by the karolinska university hospital research ethics committee (approval
no. 03-708).

diclofenac (cayman chemicals) was dissolved in
optimem (gibco brl , sundbyberg, sweden) to
achieve the concentrations desired. celecoxib (pfizer,
täby, sweden); ono-8713, ono-ae3-240, and onoae3-208 (a gift from ono pharmaceuticals co., ltd.,
osaka, japan);  xxxd1097xxx  and pge 2 (sigma-aldrich);
and butaprost (cayman chemicals) were dissolved in
 xxxd1896xxx  (dmso; sigma-aldrich) and further
diluted in optimem or rpmi medium (gibco brl)
to its final concentration (final dmso concentration,
0.1%–0.7%).

inducible form of cox, has frequently been detected
in both premalignant and malignant tissues. 8 cox-2
is functionally coupled to microsomal  xxxg1876xxx -1 ( xxxg1876xxx ), which converts prostaglandin h 2 to pge 2 .9 overexpression of  xxxg1876xxx  in
cancer tissues has been reported, further supporting
an important function of prostanoids in tumorigenesis.10,11 pge 2 exerts its physiological effects by interacting with a subfamily of four distinct g-protein–
coupled receptors designated ep1, ep 2 , ep3, and  xxxg1875xxx .
pge2 promotes tumor growth by stimulating ep receptor signaling with subsequent enhancement of cellular
proliferation, promotion of angiogenesis, inhibition of
apoptosis, stimulation of invasion, and suppression of
immune responses.12,13
in this study, we investigated the expression of key
enzymes involved in the production of pge 2 as well as
its prostanoid ep receptors in mb primary tumors and
cell lines. we also studied the effects of pge 2 , the ep 2
agonist butaprost, and four ep antagonists, ono-8713,
ono-ae3-240, ono-ae3-208, and  xxxd1097xxx , that
specifically block the function of ep1, ep3 , and  xxxg1875xxx ,
respectively, on mb cell growth. furthermore, we
examined the effect of inhibiting cox-2 using rna
silencing by small interfering rna or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids) on mb cell proliferation,
apoptosis, and pge2 secretion in vitro and in nude mice
carrying established mb xenografts.

in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells. high expression of
 xxxg1876xxx  was also detected in all clinical mb tumors
investigated (fig. 1a). neither cox-2 protein nor
 xxxg1876xxx  was detected in surrounding stromal cerebellar tissue, except for purkinje cells that also expressed
cox-2 and  xxxg1876xxx  (not shown; fig. 1a). moreover,
abundant expression of the four prostanoid ep receptors
was detected in all clinical mb tumors analyzed, both in
tumor cells and in stromal endothelial cells. localization
of the receptors was shown to be both at outer membranes and within subcellular compartments (fig. 1a).
as a negative control, sections were immunostained with
isotype control antibody, which resulted in no staining
(data not shown).
examination of human mb cell lines by western
blotting revealed that all mb cell lines express cox-2,
 xxxg1876xxx , and ep1 through  xxxg1875xxx  receptors (fig. 1b).

statistical analysis

pge2 induces proliferation of mb cells

the ec50 values were evaluated from a plot of survival
versus the logarithm of the molar drug concentration,
using a standard dose–response curve defined by four
parameters: the baseline response (bottom), the maximum response (top), the slope (hill slope), and the drug
concentration:

because most of the mb cell lines investigated expressed
high levels of cox-2 as well as  xxxg1876xxx , we measured
the levels of pge 2 in the supernatant from the mb cell
lines  xxxd324xxx  med and pfsk-1. both cell lines secreted
pge 2 , levels of which could be significantly reduced in
a dose-dependent manner by treatment with the cox
inhibitors diclofenac and celecoxib (p , 0.01; fig. 2a).
the concentrations that inhibited 50% of pge 2 secretion (ic 50) from  xxxd324xxx  med and pfsk-1 cells were
40 mm diclofenac and 10 mm celecoxib, and 35 mm
diclofenac and 12 mm celecoxib, respectively (fig. 2a).
half-maximal inhibition (ic50) of cox enzymatic activity as measured by the conversion of  xxxd208xxx  to
prostaglandin h 2 was achieved with 0.1 mm diclofenac
or 0.005 mm celecoxib in cell extracts isolated from
 xxxd324xxx  med or pfsk-1 cells (data not shown).
we also examined the effect of exogenous addition
of pge 2 and of the commercially available ep 2 receptor agonist butaprost on the proliferation of mb cells.
incubation of mb cell lines with increasing concentration of pge 2 (5 nm to 1 mm) or butaprost (1–10 mm)
for 72 h resulted in a significant increase of mb cell proliferation (pge 2:  xxxd283xxx  med, p , 0.05;  xxxd324xxx  med,

reduction of cox-2 protein, as analyzed by western
blotting, was observed in both mb cell lines infected
with lentiviral cox-2 sirna compared with cells
infected with the scrambled sirna construct (fig. 3c).
both mb cell lines infected with the cox-2–specific
sirna demonstrated significantly reduced cell proliferation ( xxxd324xxx  med, p , 0.0022; pfsk-1, p , 0.0152;
fig. 3d) after 5 days of incubation, compared with cells
infected with the scrambled sirna construct.
as shown in fig. 1, a and b, all mb/spnet primary
tumors and cell lines investigated expressed the four
pge 2 receptors ep1 through  xxxg1875xxx . we therefore examined the effect of ep receptor antagonists on mb cell
proliferation using the ep1-specific receptor antagonist ono-8713, the ep3 -specific antagonist onoae3-240, and the  xxxg1875xxx  -specific antagonists onoae3-208 and  xxxd1097xxx . the biological ec50 values of
the different receptor antagonists ranged from 14 mm
to 30 mm for ono-8713 and from 9 mm to 42 mm for
ono-ae3-240; both  xxxg1875xxx  receptor antagonists, onoae3-208 and  xxxd1097xxx , were less efficient in inhibiting
mb proliferation with ec50 concentrations varying from
55 mm to 175 mm for ono-ae3-208 and from 70 mm
to 270 mm for  xxxd1097xxx  (fig. 3e).
inhibition of cox-2 activity induces apoptosis
of mb cells
to further study the mechanisms of nsaid-mediated
inhibition of mb cell growth, we evaluated the effects
of diclofenac and celecoxib on the induction of apoptosis. cell cycle analyses of  xxxd283xxx  med,  xxxd324xxx  med, and
pfsk-1 cells treated with diclofenac or celecoxib for 48 h
showed an accumulation of cells in the sub-g1 phase of
the cell cycle (fig. 4a). a pronounced g2 arrest was also
observed in mb cells treated with diclofenac (fig. 4a).
western blot performed on protein extract isolated from
mb cells treated with diclofenac or celecoxib for 24 h
and 48 h revealed activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3
followed by cleavage of parp, a downstream substrate
of caspase-3 (fig. 4b). no cleavage of bid (bh3 inter-

treated with nsaids (fig. 4b).
nsaids significantly inhibit mb growth in vivo
to investigate the therapeutic effects of nsaids on mb
growth in vivo, we treated nmri nu/nu mice carrying
 xxxd283xxx  med xenografts with either diclofenac or celecoxib. mice were randomly assigned to receive 250 mg/
liter diclofenac in the drinking water (n 5 8) or 2 mg
celecoxib administered through oral gavage every 24 h
for 10 days (n 5 7) or to be left untreated (diclofenac
control, n 5 9; celecoxib control, n 5 10). mean tumor
volume at start of treatment was 0.24 ml. both diclofenac
and celecoxib significantly inhibited mb tumor growth
after 10 days of treatment compared to untreated controls (diclofenac, p 5 0.0006; tumor volume index, 4.4
vs. 7.7; celecoxib, p 5 0.0130; tumor volume index, 4.3
vs. 7.4; fig. 5a,c). the mean tumor weight recorded at
autopsy was 0.62 g (95% ci, 0.44–0.88 g) for diclofenactreated mice, 0.94 g (95% ci, 0.59–1.22 g) for celecoxibtreated mice, 1.30 g (95% ci, 0.95–1.63 g) for untreated
diclofenac controls, and 1.44 g (95% ci, 1.09–1.83 g) for
untreated celecoxib controls (fig. 5b,d).
immunohistochemistry of tumors from mice treated
with either diclofenac or celecoxib showed a significant
elevated expression of active caspase-3 (diclofenac, p 5
0.0022; celecoxib, p 5 0.0022) indicating that these
nsaids induce apoptosis of mb in vivo (fig. 5e,f).
since inhibition of angiogenesis can contribute to
reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, we
also determined the effect of diclofenac and celecoxib
on microvessel density. microvessel density was significantly decreased (33%) in tumors from animals treated
with either diclofenac or celecoxib compared with
tumors from animals receiving no treatment (diclofenac,
p , 0.001; celecoxib, p , 0.001; fig. 5e,f). both
diclofenac and celecoxib induced a significant reduction
(26%) in expression of the nuclear proliferation marker
ki-67 compared with untreated tumors (diclofenac, p 5
0.0022; celecoxib, p 5 0.0022; fig. 5e,f).

discussion
in this study, we examined the role of the pge 2 synthetic pathway in mb and demonstrate that mb primary
tumors and cell lines constitutively express cox-2 and
 xxxg1876xxx  as well as all four prostanoid ep receptors.
moreover, pge 2 stimulates mb cell proliferation, and
inhibition of pge2 production or its receptors has therapeutic efficacy on mb in vitro and in vivo.

mb is considered to originate from primitive pluripotent neuroepithelial stem cells, located in the external

antagonists targeting the  xxxg1873xxx  are not yet commercially available for experimental research. although
more studies need to be performed in order to exactly
demonstrate which ep receptors are most important in
promoting mb cell proliferation, our data indicate that
the prostanoid receptors ep1, ep 2 , and ep3 are important for pge2-mediated stimulation of mb cell growth.
because we showed that mb expressed high levels of
both cox-2 and  xxxg1876xxx , we decided to investigate the
effect of inhibiting pge 2 secretion by targeting cox-2.
as shown in fig. 3a and table 2, both the dual cox-1/
cox-2 nsaid diclofenac and the cox-2–specific
nsaid celecoxib, inhibited mb cell growth and clonogenic capacity in all cell lines tested. the biological ec50
values ranged from 27.5 mm to 79.1 mm for diclofenac
and from 7.8 mm to 13.5 mm for celecoxib (table 2) after
48 h of drug incubation, which is comparable to ec50
values found in other cancer cell lines.15,35–38 although
the ec 50 doses of diclofenac and celecoxib are higher
than the concentrations of nsaids required to inhibit
the enzymatic activity of cox in mb cells, they correspond to the concentrations required to inhibit 50%
of pge 2 secretion from mb cells. these data, together
with the demonstration that pge 2 stimulates mb cell
proliferation (fig. 2b), suggest that pge 2 is important
for mb growth. the observed growth inhibitory effect
of nsaids was associated with the induction of caspasedependent apoptosis (fig. 4b). to further test the
importance of cox-2 expression in mb, we suppressed
cox-2 expression by cox-2 sirna (fig. 3c). this
suppression resulted in inhibition of mb cell proliferation (fig. 3d). although a number of other reports have
shown that nsaids induce cytotoxicity in tumor cells
by cox-2 inhibition followed by induction of apoptosis, it cannot be excluded that nsaid targets other
than cox-2 are affected in mb cells. 39,40 for instance,
the cox-2–specific inhibitors, celecoxib and rofecoxib,
have been shown to decrease cell survival in colon cancer and prostate cancer cell lines, independent of their
cox-2 expression.41,42 in addition to specific cox-2
inhibition, celecoxib has also been shown to direct target
protein-dependent kinase-1, the endoplasmic reticulum
ca 21 atpase complex, cyclin-dependent kinases, and
various carbonic anhydrases. inhibition of these proteins
leads to apoptosis or inhibition of cell cycle progression,
angiogenesis, and metastasis.40,42–45 the concentration
of nsaid required to induce these effects is higher than
that achieved in the plasma of patients in clinical studies
to obtain anticarcinogenic effect.40
we found that treatment with nsaids was associated
with the suppression of growth of established human
mb xenografts in nude mice (fig. 5a–d). the doses of
nsaid used for the in vivo study were based on our previously obtained results in experimental neuroblastoma,
and the dose for celecoxib is significantly lower than the
oncological dose of 250 mg/m2 orally twice daily established for children.36,46,47 all mice gained in weight during treatment and showed no signs of toxicity. to better
understand the growth inhibitory effects of diclofenac
and celecoxib, measurements of apoptosis, microvessel
density, and cell proliferation were performed ex vivo

cox-2 was not detected (fig. 1a). hence, mb cells
might acquire cox-2 expression at some stage during
the development from pluripotent neuroepithelial progenitor cells. high expression of cox-2 has also been
reported in other tumors of cns origin, including glioma
and ependymoma, as well as in meningioma. 24,26–28
we also detected constitutive expression of  xxxg1876xxx 
in both mb primary tumors and cell lines (fig. 1a,b).
although information on  xxxg1876xxx  expression in brain
tumors is limited, this finding is consistent with other
reports describing increased expression of  xxxg1876xxx  in
cancers.10,11
compared to nonmalignant nervous tissue, mb and
other tumors of cns origin contain increased levels
of  xxxd208xxx .4,29 the presence of high levels of
cox-2 and  xxxg1876xxx  in mb cells may therefore generate a favorable environment for the efficient production
of prostanoids.
measurement of pge2 using elisa revealed that mb
cells secrete pge 2 that could be reduced by inhibiting
cox (fig. 2a). furthermore, exogenous addition of
pge 2 to serum-starved mb cells resulted in increased
proliferation (fig. 2b). other reports have shown that
patients with malignant brain tumors have significantly higher concentrations of pge 2 in their tumors
and plasma compared with patients with benign brain
tumors or with nontumoral control patients.6,30 moreover, the concentration of pge2 in plasma decreases following neurosurgical resection of both malignant and
benign brain tumors.5
having shown that pge2 stimulates mb cell growth,
we looked for the expression of prostanoid receptors in
both clinical mb samples and cell lines and found that
all four ep receptors (ep1 through  xxxg1875xxx ) were abundantly
expressed in mb (fig. 1a,b). although the precise role
of each ep receptor in cancer development has not been
fully characterized, the generation of specific ep receptor
knockout mice has shown that all four prostanoid receptors may contribute to carcinogenesis, malignant aggressiveness, and tumor progression in a number of cancers.31
despite structural and sequence similarities among the
ep receptors they are coupled to different intracellular
signaling pathways, and the receptors exhibit different
functions depending on tumor type.12 of interest, the
stimulation of ep receptors by pge 2 has been shown
to activate intracellular signaling pathways that are
aberrantly regulated in mb. for instance, stimulation
of  xxxg1873xxx  by pge2 activates the kinase activity of
the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (pi3k) oncogene and
stimulates the transcription-factor activity of b-catenin,
whereas pge2-mediated activation of ep1 or  xxxg1875xxx  induces
phosphorylation of the  xxxg682xxx  resulting in the activation of the erk signaling pathway.32–34 hence, activation of ep receptors by pge2 may
contribute to the enhancement of signal transduction by
these pathways in mb. in our study, treatment with the
ep1 antagonist ono-8713 or ep3 antagonist onoae3-240 reduced mb cell growth, whereas antagonists
targeting the  xxxg1875xxx  receptor were less effective in inhibiting mb cell growth. we also found that the  xxxg1873xxx  agonist
butaprost stimulated mb cell growth. to our knowledge,

shown to potentiate the effect of both irradiation and
cytotoxic drugs. 52–54 hence, agents that target components in the eicosanoid cascade may prove beneficial,
especially as an adjuvant therapy because their advantageous effect may be the synergism with irradiation
or conventional cytotoxic treatment or novel agents
targeted against other pro-carcinogenic pathways. particularly the youngest children are at risk for irreversible
adverse side effects from irradiation. since ionizing radiation induces cox-2 expression the concomitant use of
agents targeting the production of prostanoids may be
beneficial for patients through both improved therapeutic efficacy and the putative limitation of adverse longterm neurological side effects.53

(fig. 5e,f). immunohistochemistry of tumors from
diclofenac- and celecoxib-treated animals demonstrated
elevated expression of active caspase-3 compared with
untreated tumors, indicating that both nsaids induce
apoptosis of mb in vivo. we also detected significant
reduction in the expression of the cell proliferation
marker ki-67 in tumors from animals treated with
nsaids. the increased number of caspase-3–positive
cells in tumors from animals treated with nsaids might
be due to a direct effect of cox-2 inhibition. however,
we also observed a significant reduction in microvessel
density in the treated tumors compared with nontreated
tumors (fig. 5e,f). cox-2 is expressed within neovasculature in tumors, and a number of reports have shown
that certain nsaids, including celecoxib and diclofenac,
suppress angiogenesis.48–51 thus, both diclofenac and
celecoxib may inhibit mb growth by a combination of
apoptosis of tumor cells and inhibition of angiogenesis.
the current treatment approach for patients with
childhood mb is surgery followed by irradiation and
chemotherapy. inhibition of cox-2 activity has been
