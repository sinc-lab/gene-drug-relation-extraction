context: the ret  xxxg2198xxx  encoding gene acts as a dominantly transforming oncogene in
thyroid carcinoma and other malignancies.  xxxd2985xxx  ( xxxd2985xxx ) is an oral atp-competitive tyrosine
kinase inhibitor that is in advanced clinical experimentation in leukemia.
objective: we tested whether  xxxd2985xxx  inhibited ret kinase and oncogenic activity.
methods:  xxxd2985xxx  activity was studied by an in vitro ret immunocomplex kinase assay and
immunoblotting. the effects of  xxxd2985xxx  on proliferation of human tt, mz-crc-1, and tpc-1
thyroid carcinoma cells, which harbor endogenous oncogenic ret alleles, and of nih3t3 fibroblasts
transfected with oncogenic ret mutants were determined.  xxxd2985xxx  activity on tt cell xenografted tumors in athymic mice was measured.
results:  xxxd2985xxx  inhibited immunopurified ret kinase at the ic50 of 25.8 nm (95% confidence
interval [ci] ⫽ 23.15–28.77 nm). it also inhibited (ic50 ⫽ 33.9 nm; 95% ci ⫽ 26.41– 43.58 nm) kinase
activity of ret/v804m, a ret mutant displaying resistance to other  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor.
 xxxd2985xxx  blunted phosphorylation of point-mutant and rearranged ret-derived oncoproteins
and inhibited proliferation of ret-transformed fibroblasts and ret mutant thyroid carcinoma cells.
finally, after 3 weeks of treatment with  xxxd2985xxx  (30 mg/kg/d), the volume of tt cell (medullary
thyroid carcinoma) xenografts was reduced from 133 mm3 to an unmeasurable size (difference ⫽
133 mm3, 95% ci ⫽ ⫺83 to 349 mm3) (p ⬍ .001).  xxxd2985xxx -treated tt cell tumors displayed a
reduction in the mitotic index, ret phosphorylation, and signaling.
conclusions:  xxxd2985xxx  is a potent inhibitor of ret kinase and has promising preclinical activity in
models of ret-driven medullary thyroid carcinoma. (j clin endocrinol metab 98: e811–e819, 2013)

 xxxd2985xxx -mediated ret inhibition

carcinoma (ptc), result from chromosomal inversions or
translocations that generate hybrid transforming genes,
termed ret/ptc. ret/ptc genes are composed of the
tk-encoding domain of ret fused to the promoter and
5⬘-terminal region of unrelated genes, most commonly
ccdc6 (ret/ xxxg1867xxx ) and ncoa4 (ret/ptc3) (4).
ret gene rearrangements have been recently demonstrated to play an important role in a subset of cases of
non–small cell lung cancer (5–7) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (8), up-regulated ret expression is associated with several malignancies, including neuroblastoma (9), pancreatic cancer (10), and breast cancer (11).
small molecule  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors (tkis) of various chemical classes inhibiting ret  xxxg2198xxx  (tk)
are in clinical development (12, 13). the clinically most
advanced ret tkis are  xxxd3489xxx  (zd6474) and  xxxd401xxx  (xl184), both recently registered for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic mtc (14 –17).
 xxxd2985xxx  ( xxxd2985xxx ) is an oral multitargeted tki that
potently inhibits bcr-abl and additional protein tyrosine kinases, including src-related kinases, and members of the iii/iv/v rtk classes, such as  xxxg801xxx  (fms-related
 xxxg2198xxx  3), kit,  xxxg791xxx  (fibroblast growth factor
receptor 1), pdgfr␣ (platelet-derived growth factor receptor ␣), and  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx  (vascular endothelial
growth factor [vegf] receptor-2/ xxxg1274xxx ) (18 –20). unlike  xxxd3489xxx ,  xxxd2985xxx  is a class 2
inhibitor, eg, a tki that preferentially binds the inactive
conformation of the kinase (21).  xxxd2985xxx  inhibits both
native and mutant forms of bcr-abl, including the
t315i gatekeeper mutant, which is refractory to imatinib
and was highly active in patients with ph-positive leukemias with resistance to tkis (ref. 22 and nct01207440,
www.clinicaltrials.gov).
here, we provide evidence that  xxxd2985xxx  is a novel
potent ret tki that might be suited for treatment of
ret-driven malignancies, such as mtc.

proteins were harvested, and ret phosphorylation
was determined by immunoblot at 13 (tt) or 14 (mzcrc-1) days of  xxxd2985xxx  treatment. consistent with
growth inhibition, ret phosphorylation clearly decreased at  xxxd2985xxx  doses as small as 1 nm (figure 3c).
in parallel,  xxxd2985xxx  also decreased phosphorylation of
several proteins that function in the ret signaling cascade, such as shc, plc␥ (phospholipase c␥), mapk (mitogen-activated protein kinase; extracellular signal-regulated kinase [erk]), akt, and ribosomal s6 protein
(figure 3c). the  xxxd2985xxx  dose (1 nm) is smaller that that
able to achieve an efficient reduction of ret phosphorylation after 1 hour of treatment (figure 1c) and to inhibit
ret kinase in vitro (figure 1b). this result might be explained by the fact that  xxxd2985xxx  is a type 2 kinase inhib-

itor that preferentially binds to the inactive conformation
of the kinase, a conformation that, in intact cells, might be
fostered by chronic exposure to the drug (21).
 xxxd2985xxx  is a multitargeted agent and its growth inhibitory effects can be mediated by the concurrent inhibition of additional tyrosine kinases other than ret.
among the additional  xxxd2985xxx  targets (18), tt cells did
not show detectable phosphorylation of abl (y245)
(supplemental figure 3b), lyn (y397), lck (y394), fyn

phosphorylation of 42 different rtks in tt and mzcrc-1 cells. besides ret, both cell lines expressed detectable phosphorylation of additional rtks such as
egfr ( xxxg681xxx  receptor),  xxxg1274xxx /
 xxxg1274xxx  (vegf receptor 2),  xxxg1194xxx  ( xxxg1194xxx ),  xxxg1145xxx 
( xxxg1145xxx ) and dtk (tyro3)
(supplemental figure 3a). among them,  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx 
is a known  xxxd2985xxx  target (18). accordingly, we observed by immunoblot that  xxxd2985xxx  (10 nm) decreased
 xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx  (but not egfr) phosphorylation (supplemental figure 3b). at 2 weeks of treatment,  xxxd2985xxx 
inhibited  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx  phosphorylation in tt and
mz-crc-1 cells even at a dose as small as 1 nm (figure
3c). thus, it is possible that  xxxd2985xxx  growth inhibitory
effects in mtc cells are due to combined inhibition of ret
and  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx .
 xxxd2985xxx  inhibits ret-mediated tumor growth in mouse
xenografts
we sought to determine whether  xxxd2985xxx  had inhibitory effects in vivo against ret-dependent tumor growth.
in previous studies using bcr-ablt315i transduced ba/f3
cells, daily oral  xxxd2985xxx  dosing of 10 and 30 mg/kg
caused suppression of tumor growth and 50 mg/kg caused
tumor regression (18). at a dose of 30 mg/kg, plasma
 xxxd2985xxx  levels in mice were reported to reach 782 nm at
2 hours and then decline to 561 nm at 6 hours and 8 nm
at 24 hours postdose (18). therefore, plasma levels exceeding the in vitro ic50 values for ret can be sustained
in mice for at least ⬎6 hours with a 30 mg/kg oral dose.
thus, we selected a 30 mg/kg dose to obtain proof of the
concept that  xxxd2985xxx  can obstruct in vivo ret-mediated
tumor growth. we injected nude mice with 5 ⫻ 107 tt
cells. after approximately 30 days, when tumors measured ⬃100 to 150 mm3, animals were randomly assigned
to receive by oral gavage  xxxd2985xxx  (30 mg/kg/d) (n ⫽ 10)
or vehicle (n ⫽ 9) 5 days/wk for 3 weeks. tumor diameter
was monitored with calipers. treatment with  xxxd2985xxx 
strongly reduced tumor growth (p ⬍ .001) (figure 4a).
after 3 weeks of  xxxd2985xxx  treatment, the volume of tt
cell xenografts was reduced from 133 mm3 (95% ci ⫽
93–173 mm3) to unmeasurable size, whereas in vehicletreated mice, mean tumor volume increased from 136
mm3 (95% ci ⫽ 90 –181 mm3) to 541 mm3 (95% ci ⫽
377–704 mm3). effects were very rapid and reduced tumor burden was statistically significant (p ⬍ .05) as early
as at day 8 of treatment. according to previous reports
(18), we noted no signs of overt toxicity in mice with a
maximal decrease in body weight ⬍10% (untreated vs
treated, p ⬎ .05) (supplemental figure 4a), no change in
animal behavior, and, only occasionally, a modest skin
rash on the back and scalp.

to perform biochemical and histological studies, we
treated a set of tt cell-induced large tumors (⬃650 –700
mm3) for a short time period (7 days). after 7 days of
 xxxd2985xxx  (30 mg/kg/d) treatment, the average volume of
xenografts (n ⫽ 6) was reduced from 736 mm3 (95% ci ⫽
335–1138 mm3) to 237 mm3 (95% ci ⫽ 155–320 mm3),
whereas in vehicle-treated mice (n ⫽ 6) mean tumor volume increased from 587 mm3 (95% ci ⫽ 268 –906 mm3)
to 901 mm3 (95% ci ⫽ 545–1257 mm3) (p ⬍ .05) (figure
4b). in addition, no significant reduction in the weight of
the mice (untreated vs treated, p ⬎ .05) was observed in
these mice (supplemental figure 4b).  xxxd2274xxx  days, tumors
were excised, and proteins were harvested from ponatinibtreated and vehicle-treated tumors. ret and ret-signaling component (shc, plc␥, and ribosomal s6) phosphorylation was decreased upon  xxxd2985xxx  treatment;
mapk phosphorylation was decreased in all but 1 sample
(figure 4c). on histological examination, ponatinibtreated tumors featured a reduction in tumor cell density
and diffuse fibrosis (p ⬍ .001) (figure 5 and supplemental
table 1). no significant change in the extent of necrosis
(supplemental table 1) and in the density of microvessels
(data not shown) was observed. moreover,  xxxd2985xxx 
treatment caused a reduction in the proliferative index,
with a strong reduction in ki-67 reactive cells (figure 5
and supplemental table 1) and mitotic index (supplemental table 1). treated tumors showed also a small, albeit
significant (p ⬍ .001), increase in tumor cell death with an
increased fraction of cells immunoreactive for cleaved
 xxxg341xxx  (supplemental table 1).

finally, for target inhibition experiments, we injected
another group of nude mice (n ⫽ 6) with 5 ⫻ 107 tt cells.
after approximately 40 days, when tumors measured
⬃500 mm3, animals were randomly assigned to receive by
oral gavage a single dose of  xxxd2985xxx  (30 mg/kg) (n ⫽ 4)
or vehicle (n ⫽ 2). as early as 5 hours after dosing, ret
protein phosphorylation was clearly decreased (supplemental figure 5).
furthermore, a lower (66%) dose of  xxxd2985xxx  (20 mg/
kg/d, 5 doses in 7 days) was also able to cause a significant
reduction (p ⬍ .05) of tt cell-induced tumor volume (in
treated mice [n ⫽ 8] average volume was reduced from 440
mm3 [95% ci ⫽ 244 – 636 mm3] to 88 mm3 [95% ci ⫽
51–127 mm], whereas in vehicle-treated mice [n ⫽ 7],
mean tumor volume increased from 382 mm3 [95%
ci ⫽ 183–580 mm3] to 635 mm3 [95% ci ⫽ 305–964
mm3]) (p ⬍ .05) (supplemental figure 6a). in parallel,
ret protein phosphorylation was decreased (supplemental figure 6b).

discussion
ret genetic alteration is involved in several human malignancies, including ptc (ret/ptc gene rearrangements) (4), mtc (ret point mutations) (1–3), lung adenocarcinoma (kif5b/ret and ret/ xxxg1867xxx ) (5–7), and
chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (bcr-ret and
fgfr1op-ret) (8). thus, ret kinase is an appealing
molecular target for cancer therapy. several ret tkis

 xxxd2985xxx -mediated ret inhibition

have been identified, and their efficacy has been studied in
preclinical models and, in some cases, in clinical trials. the
most advanced drugs,  xxxd3489xxx  (zd6474) and  xxxd401xxx  (xl184), target ret as well as other receptors
including  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx  (in the case of both) and egfr
(in the case of  xxxd3489xxx ) (12, 13). a lesson learned from
other neoplasia is that it is important to have available
alternative and more potent tkis if the first inhibitor fails
or patients develop resistance. in some instances, resistance can be mediated by mutations in the target kinase
that impair drug binding, as in the case of mutations targeting the “gatekeeper” residue, positioned at the gate of
the atp binding pocket (22).
here, we show that  xxxd2985xxx  ( xxxd2985xxx ) is a potent
ret kinase inhibitor at clinically achievable drug levels.
the ic50 of  xxxd2985xxx  for the isolated ret kinase was 25.8
nm and in intact mtc cells, when the treatment was prolonged for approximately 2 weeks, strong inhibition of
ret phosphorylation and cell proliferation was detected
at a  xxxd2985xxx  concentration of 1 nm. plasma levels exceeding the in vitro ic50 values for ret were previously
reported to be sustained in mice for at least ⬎6 hours with
30 mg/kg oral dosing, declining to 8 nm at 24 hours postdose (18). here we show that 30 mg/kg (p ⬍ .001) or 20
mg/kg (p ⬍ .05)  xxxd2985xxx  doses reduced growth of tt cell
xenografts in nude mice as well as ret phosphorylation.
in tt cell xenografts, ret target inhibition was observed
as early as 5 hours after 30 mg/kg  xxxd2985xxx  dosing. a
limitation of our study is that a dose-response experiment
was not performed to determine the minimal  xxxd2985xxx 
dose effective in the mouse tt cell xenograft. however, it
is important to note that at doses of 30 mg, the trough
blood  xxxd2985xxx  concentration surpassed 40 nm in human
patients with leukemia (34).
 xxxd2985xxx  is a multitargeted agent and its effects in
mtc cells can result from the inhibition of other targets
besides ret. at variance from other known  xxxd2985xxx 
targets,  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx  is expressed and phosphorylated
in both mtc samples (35) and cell lines (15), and
 xxxd2985xxx  efficiently blocked  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx  phosphorylation in mtc cells. thus, it is possible that  xxxg1274xxx /
 xxxg1274xxx  inhibition may cooperate with ret inhibition in
mediating  xxxd2985xxx  effects in mtc cells.
ret mutants in the gatekeeper (v804) or the adjacent
y806 residue are resistant to both  xxxd3489xxx  and pyrazolopirimidines (pp1 and  xxxd1307xxx ) (24, 30).  xxxd2985xxx  inhibited v804m/l and y806c ret protein mutants, although at doses higher than those required to inhibit the
other ret mutants. this result is consistent with the notion that  xxxd2985xxx  inhibits efficiently the t315i gatekeeper mutant of bcr-abl (18), as well as multiresistant
 xxxg801xxx -itd f691i mutant (36). mutations targeting the

j clin endocrinol metab, may 2013, 98(5):e811–e819

ret residue y806 are exceedingly rare; v804, instead, is
quite commonly mutated in both familial (from 5% to
32%) and sporadic cases of mtc, particularly in some
geographic regions (37).
mtc is commonly associated with ret oncogenic
conversion and 2 multitarget agents with ret inhibitory
activity,  xxxd3489xxx  and  xxxd401xxx , have been recently
approved for mtc treatment (16, 17). given the potent
anti-ret activity of  xxxd2985xxx , our data suggest that it
may be worth testing in patients affected by mtc and
possibly other ret-driven neoplasms.
