abstract
the purpose of this study was to
investigate the in vitro effects of flunixin meglumine, a cyclo-oxygenase
inhibitor, and  xxxd2423xxx , a reported cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitor, on the synthesis
of cyclo-oxygenase end-products
thromboxane b2 and prostaglandin
e2, lipoxygenase derived 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, tumor
necrosis factor and  xxxg748xxx .
six adult horses were each randomly administered flunixin meglumine (1.1 mg/kg) or  xxxd2423xxx 
(2.2 mg/kg) intravenously every
12 hours with the drug treatments
separated by two weeks. blood samples were obtained prior to initiating treatment, the last day of treatment and for two consecutive days
after the termination of treatment
for measurement of serum concentrations of thromboxane b2 as well
as isolation of peripheral blood
monocytes. quantitation of unstimulated, endotoxin- and calcium
inophore-induced synthesis of
thromboxane b2,  xxxd1903xxx ,
12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid,
 xxxg2296xxx  and tissue
factor by peripheral blood monocytes was performed in vitro. both
flunixin meglumine and  xxxd2423xxx 
significantly decreased serum concentrations of thromboxane b2
demonstrating in vivo cyclo-oxygenase inhibition. there were no significant differences between drug
treatment groups in the in vitro production of thromboxane b2,
 xxxd1903xxx , 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid,  xxxg2296xxx  or  xxxg748xxx . this

toxemic horses (6-10). these mediators are synthesized by cells of the
mononuclear phagocyte system, and
their synthesis may be altered by inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase activity. for
instance, aspirin augments the generation of monocyte  xxxg748xxx  activity
by directing  xxxd208xxx  metabolism away from cyclo-oxygenase
and towards lipoxygenase (11). the
subsequent increased production of at
least one lipoxygenase product,
12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, augments the expression of  xxxg748xxx 
(1 1). furthermore, the results of recent
studies also have demonstrated that a
cyclo-oxygenase product,  xxxd1903xxx , down regulates the synthesis of
 xxxg2296xxx  in response to
stimulation with endotoxin (12). thus,
cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, such as
ibuprofen, result in increased synthesis
of  xxxg2296xxx  (13).
with these recent findings in mind,
we hypothesized that repeated administration of flunixin meglumine to
horses would inhibit endotoxininduced metabolism of arachidonic
acid by cyclo-oxygenase and that such
inhibition would result in 1) decreased
production of thromboxane b2 and
 xxxd1903xxx , 2) increased synthesis of  xxxg2296xxx , 3) redirection of  xxxd208xxx  towards
lipoxygenase, 4) increased synthesis
of 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid,
and 5) increased production of tissue
factor. additionally, we proposed
that administration of  xxxd2423xxx , a
purported inhibitor of both cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase (14,15),
would 1) reduce the synthesis of
thromboxane b2,  xxxd1903xxx , and
12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 2)
have no effect on  xxxg748xxx  synthesis, and 3) increase synthesis of tumor
necrosis factor.

materials and methods
animals

six healthy adult horses, housed in
individual box stalls and fed grass
hay, were used in this study. a crossover design was utilized to randomize
the drug treatments in each horse.
two weeks elapsed between the two
drug trials.
treatment protocol

jugular blood samples (100 ml)
were obtained at 8:00 am on day 1
before initiation of treatment. either

flunixin meglumine (1.1 mg/kg)
(banamine, schering plough corporation, kenilworth, new jersey) or
 xxxd2423xxx  (2.2 mg/kg) (ketofen, fort
dodge laboratories, fort dodge,
iowa) then was given iv every
12 hours for five consecutive days.
the drugs were administered at manufacturer recommended dosages at
intervals commonly utilized in equine
practice. subsequent blood samples
were obtained at 8:00 am on day 5
(12 hours before the last treatment),
and at 8:00 am on the two consecutive days after the termination of
treatment (days 6 and 7).
two methods were used to test the
effects of the drugs. serum concentrations of thromboxane b2, the stable
metabolite of thromboxane a2,
increase markedly during the coagulation process. the administation of
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
decreases the serum concentration of
thromboxane b2 through inhibition of
either cyclo-oxygenase or thromboxane synthase. therefore, we measured
serum concentrations of thromboxane
b2 before and after administration of
flunixin meglumine and  xxxd2423xxx .
the second method used to test the
effects of the drugs involved quantitation of the constitutive (unstimulated)
and endotoxin- and calcium ionophore (a23187)-induced synthesis of
thromboxane  xxxd1320xxx   xxxd1903xxx ,
1 2-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid,
 xxxg2296xxx , and  xxxg748xxx  by peripheral blood monocytes in
vitro. because the constitutive synthesis of these mediators in vivo is low, it
is not valid to test the effects of these
drugs without a stimulus. this in vitro
method was selected to avoid the
in vivo administration of endotoxin to
the horses, and because the results of
several recent studies indicate that
cells of the mononuclear phagocyte
system are pivotal in the body's reaction to endotoxin (9,10,16). a23187
was selected because it stimulates the
cell by increasing intracellular calcium
concentration through mechanisms
distinct from the mechanisms involved
during endotoxin stimulation.

and the concentration of immunoreactive thromboxane b2 quantitated by
radioimmunoassay (3).
isolation of peripheral blood
monocytes

blood was collected into 3.8%
sodium citrate (1 part sodium citrate:
9 parts blood). leukocyte-rich plasma
was layered over 60% percoll in
roswell park memorial institute
(rpmi)-1640 media (whitaker ma
bioproducts, walkersville, maryland)
and centrifuged to yield a mononuclear cell band. the mononuclear
cells, suspended in 1 ml rpmi-1640,
were incubated in sterile polystyrene
tubes at 37Â°c in 5% co2 for two
hours to permit adherence of monocytes. nonadherent cells were
removed by three washes with phosphate buffered saline. the adherent
cell population consisted of >85%
monocytes as determined by nonspecific esterase stain.
stimulation of monocytes

monocytes were covered with 1 ml
of rpmi-1640 media containing either
nothing (no stimulus), escherichia coli
055:b5 endotoxin (1 j,g/ml) (list
biological laboratory, campbell,
california), or the calcium ionophore,
a23187 (5 rÂ±g/ml) (sigma chemical
company, st. louis, missouri). all
tubes were incubated at 370c, 5% co2
in air for six hours. at the end of the
six hours, the supernatant from each
tube was harvested and stored frozen at
-70Â°c until assayed for immunoreactive thromboxane  xxxd1320xxx   xxxd1903xxx , and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. samples for quantitation
of 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid
were collected on day 1 (before treatment) and on day 5.
 xxxg748xxx  activity

following the six hours of incubation, monocytes were washed with
phosphate buffered saline, overlaid
with 500 pul of phosphate buffered
saline, and then frozen at -70Â°c until
assayed for  xxxg748xxx  activity.
adherent cells were thawed, sonicated, and assayed for their ability to

discussion
the results of this study confirm
that both flunixin meglumine and
 xxxd2423xxx  have activity against
cyclo-oxygenase activity in vivo. this
was evidenced by the significant
decrease in serum thromboxane b2
concentrations at the end of the treatment period. this effect has been
demonstrated previously for flunixin
meglumine (17) and was used to confirm that both drugs were pharmacologically active when administered
twice daily. inhibition of serum
thromboxane b2 synthesis was greatest
for  xxxd2423xxx , indicating more profound inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase

activity.
in contrast, neither the endotoxinnor the a23187-stimulated synthesis
of thromboxane b2 by isolated monocytes appeared to be affected by the
administration of either drug. this
was an unexpected finding in light of
the profound effect of both drugs on
serum thromboxane b2 concentra142

tions. it is feasible that the methods
used to isolate monocytes (density
gradient centrifugation followed by
suspension in cell culture media)
allowed the drugs to be displaced
from cyclo-oxygenase thereby permitting the isolated cells to respond to
the stimuli. alternatively, the concentrations of endotoxin and a23187
used in this study may have been sufficient to overshadow a moderate
decrease in cyclo-oxygenase activity.
the synthesis of thromboxane b2
by monocytes isolated from the horses
after termination of treatment
appeared to be different from their
baseline values. this was especially
evident for the unstimulated cells isolated from the horses administered
 xxxd2423xxx  and less so for the cells
from these horses exposed to endotoxin (fig. 2). it is possible that
cyclo-oxygenase activity may be
enhanced once inhibition has been
removed and that this enhancement is
only evident when the cells are mildly
or moderately stimulated by the isolation procedure alone (unstimulated
cells) or exposed to endotoxin. this
effect was not evident when the cells
were maximally stimulated with

a23187.
incubation of monocytes with
endotoxin caused an increase in
supernatant tnf activity. there was,
however, no significant effect of
either flunixin meglumine or  xxxd2423xxx  on this response. although these
findings were contrary to our hypothesis, they were consistent with those
of an in vivo study in which people
were administered endotoxin after
being treated with ibuprofen (13). the
results of a recent report indicate that
administration of aspirin decreased
the synthesis of  xxxg2296xxx 
activity by activated peritoneal
macrophages (18). these disparate
findings suggest that the control of
tnf synthesis may be dependent
upon the species and activation status
of the mononuclear cells.
in addition to being metabolized by
cyclo-oxygenase to the prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and prostacyclin,
 xxxd208xxx  also serves as the
substrate for generation of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids and leukotrienes by the lipoxygenase enzymes
(19). there is ample evidence that
certain products of  xxxg147xxx 
activity, leukotrienes a4, b4, c4, d4

and e4, are involved in the pathogenesis of adult respiratory distress syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease,
asthma, and several other allergic
syndromes in people (20). furthermore, there is convincing evidence to
implicate these products as important
mediators of endotoxic shock (21). in
the present study we elected to quantitate 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid,
a product of 12-lipoxygenase activity.
stimulation of equine peripheral
blood monocytes with the calcium
ionophore increased the concentration
of 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in
the cell supernatants six to sevenfold
over that of unstimulated monocytes.
there was no significant effect of
either drug on the synthesis of
12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid by
the peripheral blood monocytes,
though there was a trend towards an
increase by endotoxin- and calcium
ionophore-stimulated cells isolated
from horses administered  xxxd2423xxx 
(fig. 3). because  xxxd2423xxx  may
selectively inhibit  xxxg147xxx  and
cyclo-oxygenase activities, this finding may reflect a redirection of  xxxd208xxx  metabolism to 12-lipoxygenase.  xxxd2423xxx  has been shown to
be less toxic than either flunixin meglumine or phenylbutazone in the
equine species (22). a possible explanation for this reduction in toxicity
may be related to the ability of  xxxd2423xxx  to partially inhibit the lipoxygenase pathway and production of
leukotrienes. further studies are necessary to determine the effect of  xxxd2423xxx  on the equine  xxxd208xxx 
cascade.
there were significant increases in
the concentration of pge2 in the cell
supernatants and enhanced expression
of  xxxg748xxx  activity by the lysates
of the unstimulated cells isolated two
days following termination of treatment. this effect was evident for cells
from horses treated with either drug.
previous studies in our laboratory
have failed to identify this magnitude
of change in  xxxg748xxx  activity
expressed by monocytes isolated from
nontreated healthy horses on successive days (10). the association
between increasing concentrations of
pge2 and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
acid and enhanced expression of  xxxg748xxx  activity has been identified
previously in other species (11,23).
taken together, these results suggest

that the repeated administration of
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
may enhance the constitutive thrombogenic potential of equine monocytes. the results of the present study
do not identify significant differences
between the effects of flunixin meglumine and  xxxd2423xxx .
