summary: vigabatrin (vgb) is a structural analogue of the
inhibitory neurotransmitter y-amino butyric acid (gaba),
which produces its antiepileptic effect by irreversibly inhibiting
the degradative enzyme gaba-transaminase.this produces an
increase in central nervous system (cns) gaba levels. vgb
is among the few antiepileptic drugs (aeds) that was synthesized with a specific targeted mechanism in mind and was
subsequently demonstrated to function by that mechanism. ti-

agabine, a gaba reuptake blocker, is the only other “designer
drug” among the currently available aeds. therefore, vgb is
among the few aeds for which the mechanism of action is
well understood. recently, safety issues have been raised with
regard to the use of vigabatrin. this article reviews the mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of vgb.
key words: vigabatrin-antiepileptic drug-seizures-epilepsy-gab a.

history and mechanism of action

tion, lower gaba levels are seen after a seizure on the
side of the epileptic focus (3). it therefore stands to reason that elevating brain gaba levels would cause a
reduction in seizures.
animal experiments have confirmed that when vgb
is administered orally or intraperitoneally, there is an
increase over 4 h of whole-brain gaba levels, and a
sharp decrease in gaba-transaminase levels (4).because vgb causes irreversible inhibition of gabatransaminase, its effects significantly outlast its serum
half-life. gaba-transaminase levels rise to 60%of baseline 5 days after vgb administration. vgb also has an
effect on other amino acids and enzymes, such as  xxxg913xxx , when it is administered in high
doses (5). .
the fact that vgb has a well-understood mechanism
has led to successful attempts to demonstrate its actions
in vivo. this has been accomplished by several methods.
the earliest of these was the measurement of cerebrospinal fluid (csf) gaba levels. after vgb administration, a dose-proportional increase in csf gaba can be
measured. doses of 50 mgkg produce a 200-300% increase in csf gaba levels. with single-dose administration, homovanillic acid (hva) and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-hiaa)
increase initially up to 100%
but do not remain elevated (6,7). when vgb is administered chronically there is some reduction in csf
gaba levels, but even after years of therapy they remain substantially above baseline (8).
brain gaba has also been measured by mrs in patients treated with vgb. a dose-dependent increase in

vigabatrin (vgb) was first synthesized in the 1970s
and was used clinically for the first time in 1979. therefore, the clinical experience with this drug spans a longer
time period than most of the new aeds. vgb is approved for use in over 50 countries worldwide, and it is
estimated that 175,000 patients have been exposed to the
drug. the efficacy of vgb is well known, both in partial
epilepsy and in some pediatric epilepsy syndromes.
vgb consists of a racemic mixture of r- and senantiomers. the r-enantiomer is completely inactive
(1). it is presumed that the pharmacologic and toxic effects of vigabatrin are produced by the s-enantiomer.
the primary mechanism of action of vgb is believed
to arise from irreversible inhibition of gaba-transaminase, producing an increase in brain gaba. experimental evidence demonstrates a clear relationship between brain gaba levels and seizures. patients with
partial epilepsy have lower mean brain gaba levels
than controls. in investigations performed with magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (mrs), there was a significant
correlation between low gaba levels and recent seizures. well-controlled epilepsy patients had higher mean
brain gaba levels than those who were poorly controlled (2). in addition, when gaba levels are measured
with implanted microdialysis catheters in patients with
temporal lobe epilepsy undergoing presurgical evaluaaddress correspondence and reprint requests to dr. jacqueline a.

brain gaba on mrs is seen at doses of up to 3 glday.
at these dose ranges, brain concentrations of gaba rise
to about two- to threefold their baseline value. a 40%
increase occurs within 2 h of an oral dose, and daily
administration produces additional increases (9). no further increase is seen at doses of 3-6 g/day (10). brain
gaba levels measured by mrs correlated better with
improved seizure control than vgb dose (1 1).
pharmacokinetics and clinical use
absorption-and distribution
vgb is readily and rapidly absorbed and is highly
bioavailable. there is no effect of food on absorption.
because this agent is not protein-bound, it is widely distributed throughout the body (12).
metabolism
vgb is completely excreted via the kidneys and is not
metabolized. therefore, unlike many aeds, vgb has no
interaction with the hepatic cytochrome p450 system
(13). the elimination half-life is 5-8 h, which does not
change with dose or duration of therapy (14). however,
the biologic half-life of vgb depends on duration of
gaba-transaminase inhibition rather than on vgb serum half-life, and is on the order of days rather than
hours.
drug interactions
because of vgb’s lack of interactions with the cytochrome p450 system, it is associated with very few drugdrug interactions. the only known interaction is a 1530% reduction in phenytoin concentration after vgb initiation. this interaction has been found inconsistently
and its cause is unknown (15,16).

effect of age and disease state
metabolism of vgb does not differ between children
and adults. the bioavailability may be lower in children,
who may therefore require higher doses on a mgkg basis
to obtain seizure control (17).
elimination of vgb is dependent on creatinine clearance. therefore, older individuals or patients with renal
insufficiency and reduced creatinine clearance eliminate
vgb more slowly. the half-life is doubled in the elderly,
and serum concentrations will be higher. this may produce clinical adverse events, including confusion and
drowsiness, if dosages are not adjusted appropriately
(18). there are reports of frank encephalopathy with
eeg slowing in renally impaired patients receiving vgb
(19).
administration and use
the majority of clinical trials with vgb were performed using twice-daily dosing. because of its long
biologic half-life, once-daily dosing may also be appropriate. such use is indicated on a theoretical basis by the
fact that once-daily dosing of vigabatrin maintained elepilepsia. vol. 40, suppl. 5, 1999

evated brain gaba levels, as measured by mrs (1 l).
typical titration schedules include incremental dosage
increases of 0.5-1 @day on a weekly basis until a dose of
2-3 g has been achieved. if at 3 @day there has been no
improvement, it is unlikely that inarming the dose further will be of benefit. however, if some seizure reduction has occurred, increasing the dose to 4 g can be
attempted. beyond this, further increases are rarely useful.
vgb withdrawal should be performed gradually in all
but emergency cases, because rapid withdrawal may produce seizure exacerbation or status epilepticus. this was
demonstrated in an adjunctive crossover study in which
seizures worsened in some patients crossing over from
vgb to placebo but not in those changing from placebo
to vgb (20-22). a withdrawal rate of 0.5-1 @week is
usually safe.
efficacy
many controlled clinical trials with vgb have been
performed in europe and in the united states. the most
commonly studied population has been adults with frequent refractory partial seizures, with or without secondary generalization. in some european studies, other seizure types were also included. european studies involved
one or many centers. united states studies were large
and multicentered. the trial design consisted of adjunctive administration of vgb or placebo in a crossover or
parallel fashion. doses have ranged from 1 to 6 g/day. in
most studies, responder (50% seizure reduction) rates
were between 40 and 50%, as were mean overall seizure
reduction rates. all controlled trials have shown statistically significant seizure reductions in vgb treated patients (20-28).
because of the long experience with vgb, many longterm studies with vgb have been published. these studies suggest that vgb maintains its effectiveness in many
patients over years of therapy. in several long-term studies, between 39 and 72% of patients elected to remain on
vgb 3 years after initiation (29-34).
the experience with vgb monotherapy is more limited. the efficacy and safety of vgb and carbamazepine
monotherapy in patients with partial epilepsy were compared in two randomized, controlled, open-label clinical
studies (35,36). after 12 months of monotherapy in the
first study (36), 16/50 (32%) patients were seizure-free in
the vigabatrin group (dose 50 mg/kg/day) compared to
26/50 (52%) patients in the carbamazepine group (dose
titrated to plasma concentration of -35 mom); this difference was significant (p < 0.01). however, the frequency of withdrawals due to intolerance was also significantly higher in carbamazepine-treatedpatients compared to the vgb group.
in the second study, which included an 8-week titra-

s13

vigabatrin
tion phase followed by an 8-week maintenance phase in
newly diagnosed seizure patients (35), complete seizure
control was achieved in 17/37 (46%) patients overall
receiving vgb monotherapy (dose 1 g/day titrated to up
to 3.5 g/day) and 20/39 (51%) patients overall receiving
carbamazepine monotherapy (dose 0.2 g/day titrated to
up to 1.4 glday). when the subset of patients without
secondary generalization was considered, 15/31 (48%)
patients in the vgb group and 15/32 (47%) patients in
the carbamazepine group were seizure-free. in contrast,
2/6 (33%) vgb-treated patients with secondary generalization responded compared with 517 (7 1%) carbamazepine-treated patients. the frequency of withdrawals due
to intolerance was similar between treatment groups but
the overall percentage of patients who experienced at
least one adverse event was significantly higher in the
carbamazepine group (61.5% patients) compared to the
vigabatrin group (37.8% patients).
in a review of 15 small uncontrolled monotherapy
studies involving 300 patients with various types of seizure disorders, including partial epilepsy, secondary generalized epilepsy, generalized tonic-clonic epilepsy, and
infantile spasms, fisher et al. (37) reported at least a 50%
reduction of seizures in about 40% of patients.

comparison to other second-generation aeds
few prospective studies to date have directly compared vgb with other second-generation aeds. in an
open-label, multicenter, add-on study reported only in
abstract form (38), patients with focal epilepsy received
vgb (n = 114; mean dose 2.6 g/day),  xxxd2090xxx  (n =
28; mean dose 2.43 g/day), or lamotrigine (n = 60; mean
dose 260 mg/day); information regarding randomization
was not provided. seizures were reduced by at least 50%
in 46.4% of vgb-treated patients, 50% of felbamatetreated patients, and 40% of lamotrigine-treated patients.
adverse events were reported in 27.2% of patients in the
vgb group, 46.4% in the  xxxd2090xxx  group, and 25% in
the lamotrigine group; specific events were not described. statistical analyses of the efficacy and safety
results were not provided.
pediatric epilepsies
the focus of ongoing vgb research is the use of this
agent in pediatric seizure disorders, particularly in infantile spasms. case reports, a retrospective assessment, an
open-label study, and preliminary controlled clinical
studies suggest that vigabatrin is at least as effective, if
not better than, corticosteroid therapy in reducing seizure
frequency in infantile spasms (is), with a better overall
safety profile (3941). patients with tuberous sclerosis
(ts) as the underlying pathology appear to have superior
results. in one study, 22 children with infantile spasms
and ts were randomized to receive either vgb or corticosteroids. all the vgb treated children became seizure-free compared to only 5/11 of the steroid-treated

children. in addition, side effects were greater in the
steroid-treated than in the vgb-treated group (40). additional controlled trials are needed to c o n f m these results.
in studies of refractory partial seizures in children,
vgb appears to have similar efficacy to that seen in
adults, with approximately 50% obtaining a 50% reduction in seizures (42).

other epilepsy syndromes
several studies in adults and children have suggested
that vgb is not as effective for patients with generalized
epilepsy syndromes, including absence, myoclonus and
lennox-gastaut syndrome, although no formal doubleblind, placebo-controlled studies have been performed in
these patient populations (43). in some studies, myoclonus appeared to worsen after vgb administration (44).
toxicity
dose-related side effects
most of the controlled studies of vgb were performed
as add-on therapy, potentially magnifying side effects.
the most common adverse events reported in patients
receiving vgb add-on therapy are drowsiness and fatigue, dizziness, anxiety, headache, irritability, and gastrointestinal disorders (25,45,46). drowsiness, the most
common cns side effect, is reported in 1340% of patients and tends to be most pronounced during initiation
of therapy, diminishing with continued use (22,25,34,
27). weight gain has been reported in some long-term
vgb studies (31,32,34). it is uncertain if weight gain
represents a pharmacologic effect of the drug, but there is
some evidence in animals that gaba is involved in
weight maintenance (47).
intramyelinic edema
the earliest concerns about vgb arose from animal
studies demonstrating the drug-associated occurrence of
microvacuolization, or intramyelinic edema (ime),
within white matter in rats and dogs. concerns about
these findings led to a multiyear cessation of clinical
trials in the united states. as a result, there has been a
great deal of investigation of the extent of these changes
as well as the potential for their occurrence in humans.
the microvacuolization occurs only at specific brain
sites, including the cerebellum, reticular formation, optic
tracts, fornix, hypothalamus, and thalamus (48,49). it results from splitting of lamellae at the interperiod line
caused by fluid accumulation (48). there appears to be a
plateau effect in animals; high doses produce lesions
more rapidly, whereas lower doses produce lesions only
after more chronic therapy. in either case, lesion progress
only to a certain degree and then remain stable over time
(48). withdrawal of vgb caused complete reversal of
these lesions. ime occurred experimentally in rats, mice,
epilepsia voi.40,suppt. 5, i999

s14

and dogs but did not occur in primate species, even after
6 years of chronic therapy (48).
many human investigations have been performed to
look for subtle signs of ime. in animals, ime is reliably
associated with changes in mri and evoked potentials.
these changes occur with the earliest development of
ime (49-53). similar mri and evoked potential monitoring performed during double-blind and long-term trials of vgb at doses of up to 6 g and durations of up to
12 years have not demonstrated changes in either of
these tests in humans (23,54). in addition, pathologic
evaluation of brain tissue acquired from autopsy studies
of patients receiving chronic vgb have failed to show
evidence of ime (55-59). finally, data from case report
forms have been evaluated by this author to determine
whether changes in neurologic exams occur with vgb
therapy for up to 12 years. to date, there is no indication
that such changes occur (data on file, hmr). in summary, there is no evidence that ime occurs in humans.

cognitive and neuropsychiatric adverse events
neuropsychological testing has been performed in
conjunction with placebo-controlled studies of vgb.
these studies do not demonstrate a significant cognitive
effect in vgb-treated patients (60). some prospective
studies have actually shown improvement in psychometric testing with vgb use (36,61). this has also been
demonstrated in monotherapy trials (62). an encephalopathy may occur with vgb overdose or in patients
with renal insufficiency who receive a vgb dose that
has not been appropriately adjusted for creatinine clearance (19).
patients with epilepsy are at increased risk for psychiatric disturbance, including depression and psychosis
(63). episodes of psychosis have occurred in many new
aed trials. psychosis has been reported in patients receiving vgb in clinical trials and in general use. abrupt
cessation of seizures may be a risk factor (23,25,64-69).
psychosis has been reported when vgb was used as
monotherapy (35,36). a recent review calculated an incidence of severe behavior disturbance in patients treated
with vgb as 3.4% in adults and 6% of children (70).
most cases could be reversed by reduction or withdrawal
of vgb. it is difficult to assess the risk of vgb compared to other epilepsy therapies.
vgb use may cause depression. in placebo-controlled
epilepsy trials with vgb (n = 717), 3.5% of placebo
patients and 12.1% of vgb patients reported depression
(hmr, data on file). it is not known whether previous
depressive episodes are a risk factor for vgb-related
depression.
idiosyncratic reactions
rash and other hypersensitivity reactions are uncommon with vgb use (data on file, hmr). although liver
toxicity has been reported in patients receiving vgb,
epilepsia, vol. 40. suppl. 5, 1999

most patients were being treated concurrently with other
aeds known to cause hepatic toxicity or had other
known causes of liver failure, such as metastatic carcinoma or viral hepatitis (data on file, hmr) (71). vgb is
not appreciably metabolized, which is consistent with a
low likelihood of hepatocellular damage (72). however,
vgb, because of its mechanism of transaminase inhibition, causes a reduction in alt and ast levels (73). it
is not known whether this can mask early elevations in
transaminases in patients with hepatocellular damage.
nineteen of 23 patients with hepatotoxicity on vgb had
increased transaminases or ggtp.

visual field defects
at present, visual field defects (vfds) are the most
important safety issue associated with vgb use. there
appears to be a rare but unique and specific pattern of
vgb-associated field loss, which consists of a circumferential field constriction with nasal sparing. case reports began surfacing in 1997 (74,75). thus far, these
changes have not been demonstrated to worsen with continued therapy or to improve when vgb is withdrawn.
vfds were only noted almost two decades after the initial use of vgb. this may be due to the fact that visual
field changes are subtle or that they are seen only after
long-term use. one confounding factor is that the field
changes affect the peripheral vision, whereas central vision is spared. these changes may remain unnoticed by
patients for long periods of time (76). therefore, unreported cases may greatly outnumber those that are reported. in fact, in a general practice research database
maintained in the united kingdom, which tracked
11,000 patients treated with aeds from 1991 to 1996,
there did not appear to be a significantlyhigher incidence
of reported vfds in vgb-treated patients than in patients treated with other aeds (hmr, data on file).
the most intensive study that has examined the issue
of vigabatrin-associated vfd was done by krauss et al.
who examined 38 patients receiving chronic vgb
therapy i77). four patients developed either visual field
constriction or blurred vision after 2 4 0 months of
therapy. the symptomatic patients underwent ergs,
which demonstrated reduction in the cone system and
oscillatory potential component. this led to the hypothesis that the changes are due to dysfunction of gabaergic cells of the inner retina. these findings are very
preliminary, as are all the data about vgb-associated
vfds. at present, the potential for vfds must be taken
into account when the risk-benefit ratio of vgb is assessed in any given patient. visual field assessment may
be prudent in patients receiving vgb.
in addition to vfds, other ocular adverse events have
been reported in patients receiving vgb. these include
blurred vision and other nonspecific visual abnormalities
(78).

vigabatrin

conclusion
vigabatrin is a highly effective aed for partial epilepsy and infantile spasms. its pharmacokinetics are favorable compared to standard aeds. at present, there is
no evidence for development of intramyelinic edema in
humans. psychiatric adverse events and visual field defects may be rare consequences of vgb therapy. otherwise, this agent appears to be safe and well-tolerated. at
present, it is difficult to assess the place of vgb in the
aed armamentarium. additional investigation should
improve our understanding of the causes and true frequency of serious adverse events. if this knowledge is
obtainable, many patients may receive significant benefit
from vigabatrin use.
