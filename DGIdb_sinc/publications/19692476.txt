we previously reported that a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) clade b envelope protein with
a severely truncated v3 loop regained function after passage in tissue culture. the adapted virus, termed  xxxg2239xxx ,
retained the v3 truncation, was exquisitely sensitive to neutralization by the cd4 binding site monoclonal
antibody b12 and by hiv-positive human sera, used ccr5 to enter cells, and was completely resistant to small
molecule ccr5 antagonists. to examine the mechanistic basis for these properties, we singly and in combination introduced each of the 5 mutations from the adapted clone  xxxg2239xxx  into the unadapted envelope. we found
that single amino acid changes in the c3 region, the v3 loop, and in the fusion peptide were responsible for
imparting near-normal levels of envelope function to  xxxg2239xxx . t342a, which resulted in the loss of a highly
conserved glycosylation site in c3, played the primary role. the adaptive amino acid changes had no impact
on ccr5 antagonist resistance but made virus more sensitive to neutralization by antibodies to the cd4
binding site, modestly enhanced affinity for cd4, and made  xxxg2239xxx  more responsive to cd4 binding. specifically,
 xxxg2239xxx  was triggered by soluble cd4 more readily than the parental env and, unlike the parental env, could
mediate entry on cells that express low levels of cd4. in contrast,  xxxg2239xxx  interacted with ccr5 less efficiently and
was highly sensitive to antibodies that bind to the ccr5 n terminus and ecl2. therefore, enhanced utilization
of cd4 is one mechanism by which hiv-1 can overcome mutations in the v3 region that negatively affect ccr5
interactions.

the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) envelope protein (env) mediates sequential binding to cd4 and a
coreceptor, with these interactions triggering conformational
changes in env that result in fusion between the viral and
cellular membranes (2, 12, 66). the v3 loop in the gp120
subunit of the env protein is thought to interact with the
extracellular loops (ecls) of the seven-transmembrane domain hiv-1 coreceptors, ccr5 and cxcr4 (9, 10, 28, 45, 51),
while the base of the v3 loop and the bridging sheet region of
gp120 are thought to engage the amino-terminal domains of
the coreceptors (23). in addition, the v3 loop plays a major
role in determining whether a given virus strain utilizes ccr5,
cxcr4, or both coreceptors subsequent to cd4 binding (6, 7,
57). perhaps because of its role in coreceptor engagement, the
overall length of the v3 loop is highly conserved, as are specific
residues that may play key roles in receptor binding (11, 33,
70). however, the v3 loop is also a target for neutralizing
antibodies, making it subject to immune selection (20, 25, 26,
44, 47). in addition, the v3 loop as well as the highly variable
v1/v2 region shield more conserved regions of env that are
also involved in receptor binding (16, 20, 33, 58, 59).
the importance of the v3 loop for env function is shown by
the fact that genetic deletion of residues in v3 typically results

in a nonfunctional env protein (5, 19, 67). while v3 loopdeleted envs appear to fold normally and retain the ability to
bind cd4, coreceptor interactions are apparently lost (5, 19,
27, 54, 65, 67, 69). this loss of function complicates immunogen design approaches that are predicated upon removing variable loops in gp120 in the hopes of focusing the humoral
immune response on more conserved regions of env (22). to
overcome this limitation, we introduced partial v3-loop truncations into a series of hiv-1 env proteins and identified an
r5x4 hiv-1 env, termed r3a, that could tolerate partial loss
of its v3 loop (31). when 15 residues were removed from the
center of the v3 loop, leaving the first 9 and last 9 residues of
the region intact, the resulting virus [termed v3(9,9)] was
poorly functional. however, after passage in vitro, function was
enhanced via the acquisition of five mutations in the env gene.
an env cloned from the tissue culture-adapted virus, termed
 xxxg2239xxx , used ccr5 to infect cells but lost the ability to use
cxcr4, was completely resistant to ccr5 antagonists by being able to recognize the drug-bound conformation of the
coreceptor, and was exquisitely sensitive to neutralization by
hiv-1-positive human sera and by a broadly neutralizing antibody to the cd4 binding site (31). whether these attributes
were due to the v3 loop truncation, the adaptive mutations, or
some combination of the two was unclear. in addition, it is not
apparent how an env can function efficiently despite the loss of
a domain that plays an important role in coreceptor engagement.
in the present study, we investigated the roles played by the

materials and methods
cells. qt6 japanese quail fibrosarcoma and 293t/17 human embryonic kidney
cells were cultured in dulbecco modified eagle medium (dmem) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 60 ␮g of penicillin/ml, and 100 ␮g of streptomycin/ml (complete dmem). complete dmem was supplemented with 2 mm
l-glutamine for qt6 cells. hek293-derived affinofile cells (34, 49) were cultured in complete dmem supplemented with 50 ␮g of blasticidin/ml and 200 ␮g
of  xxxg418xxx /ml. human glioma  xxxd670xxx .cd4.ccr5 cells were cultured in complete
dmem supplemented with 1 mg of  xxxg418xxx /ml and 1 ␮g of  xxxd3041xxx /ml.
supt1.ccr5 and supt1.ccr5.dcsignr cells were cultured in rpmi 1640
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 60 ␮g of penicillin/ml, and 100 ␮g of
streptomycin/ml.
plasmids. all viral env genes used for production of viral pseudotypes, including 400 nucleotides upstream of the env initiation codon with the complete
coding sequences of tat, rev, and vpu, were cloned into the ecori and xhoi sites
of phspg (41). overlap pcr was used to construct envs containing single or
multiple adaptive mutations. the dualtropic env r3a (42) allows entry into both
macrophages and t cells, as well as into both cxcr4- and ccr5-expressing cell
lines. v3(9,9) and  xxxg2239xxx  have been described previously in detail (31). the
reporter plasmid encoding luciferase under the control of a t7 promoter
(pt7.luciferase) used in cell-cell fusion assays has been described previously (52).
replication-competent molecular clones were constructed by subcloning the
ecori-xhoi fragment from phspg into pnl, which contains the proviral sequence of nl4-3. all viral genes are intact, with the exception of a small deletion
in nef.
cell-cell fusion assay. this assay has been previously described (52). briefly,
“target” qt6 cells cotransfected with expression plasmids encoding a luciferase
reporter gene (pgem2 t7-luc; promega), cd4, and either ccr5 or a control
expression plasmid, were incubated with qt6 “effector” cells transfected with
env expression plasmids (1). effector cells were added to target cells ⬃18 h
posttransfection, and the cells were allowed to interact at 37°c for 7 to 8 h. the
cells were lysed, and the luciferase activity was measured with a luminometer (3).
to determine the ability of scd4 to induce cell-cell fusion, serial dilutions of
four-domain scd4 (iavi; neutralizing antibody consortium repository) were
added to cd4-negative, ccr5-positive target cells immediately prior to the
addition of env-expressing effector cells.
viral infection assays. luciferase reporter viral pseudotypes were produced in
293t/17 cells by cotransfection of the nl4-3-based luciferase vector, pnl-luc
(env⫺ vpr⫹), with plasmids expressing the desired env protein, as previously
described (4, 8). replication-competent viruses were produced in 293t/17 cells
by transfection of a nl4-3-based proviral vector with the hiv env cloned into the
xhoi and ecori sites. the virus titer was normalized by p24 content (cell
biolabs, inc., san diego, ca). for neutralization sensitivity assays, 5 ng of virus
was incubated with serial dilutions of monoclonal antibody (mab) or scd4 for
1 h at 37°c and then spinoculated onto supt1.ccr5 cells (46). the cells were
assayed for luciferase expression 3 days postinfection. mabs 17b, immunoglobulin g (igg) b12, and scd4 were obtained from the iavi neutralizing antibody
consortium repository. mab 19 binds to cd4 and blocks hiv infection (17). for
neutralization assays with mabs 45531 and 45529 (r&d systems, minneapolis,
mn) and  xxxd825xxx  (bd biosciences, san jose, ca), which bind ccr5 ecl2, the

target cells were  xxxd670xxx .cd4.ccr5. for drug inhibition assays, the ccr5 antagonist  xxxd2542xxx  was incubated with supt1.ccr5 cells in the presence of 100 nm
amd3100 (nih aids research and reference reagent program) for 1 h at
37°c before addition of 5 ng of virus, followed by spinoculation. cells were
incubated with virus and drug for 72 h and subsequently analyzed for luciferase
expression.
for kinetic assays with cd4, ccr5, and fusion blockers,  xxxd670xxx .cd4.ccr5 cells
were plated in a 96-well format at 1.5 ⫻ 104 cells per well. the following day, a
1:10 dilution of mab 19 ascites, mabs  xxxd825xxx  and ctc5 (r&d systems) at 50
␮g/ml each, or enfuvirtide at 90 ␮g/ml was added to pretreatment wells and
incubated for 1 h before 5 ng of virus/well was spinoculated onto cells for 2 h at
4°c. for all other wells, virus was first spinoculated onto cells at 4°c, followed by
transfer to 37°c, with blocking agents added immediately (t ⫽ 0 min) or at 15,
30, 60, 120, or 240 min after spinoculation. infected cells were incubated for 72 h
at 37°c and then assayed for luciferase activity. infection levels were normalized
against control well infections performed in the absence of antibodies or drug.
to monitor growth of replication-competent virus, supt1.ccr5.dcsignr
cells were infected with 5 or 50 ng of replication-competent virus, and the reverse
transcriptase activity measured by using a [3h]thymidine incorporation assay on
culture supernatants pelleted by ultracentrifugation (32).
affinofile assays. infection of the hek293-based cd4/ccr5 dual-inducible
cell line (293-affinofile) with luciferase reporter viral pseudotypes was used to
determine the cd4 and ccr5 usage efficiencies as previously described (34, 49).
please see accompanying report (27a) for full details. briefly, 96-well plates were
seeded with 104 inducible cells per well 2 days prior to cd4 and ccr5 induction.
cells were induced in a 6⫻8 matrix format using twofold serial dilutions from
0.156 to 5 ng of minocycline/ml (to induce cd4) and 0.0156 to 2 ␮m ponasterone
a (to induce ccr5) and allowed to incubate for 18 h at 37°c. induction medium
was removed, and the cells were then infected with viral pseudotypes normalized
by p24 content. for dualtropic virus infection, the induced cells were treated with
10 nm amd3100 at 37°c for 1 h prior to infection to inhibit use of endogenous
cxcr4 on 293-affinofile cells. infection was measured by luciferase expression
3 days postinfection.
the cd4 and ccr5 surface expression levels of induced cells were analyzed
by flow cytometry using phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse anti-human cd4 antibody (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) or phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse anti-human
ccr5 antibody (bd biosciences) and quantified with standardized beads from
quantibrite system (bd biosciences). the sensitivity vector describing the
relative sensitivity of viral entry to cd4 and ccr5 surface expression levels was
derived by using the versa computational platform (viral entry receptor
sensitivity analysis [http://versa.biomath.ucla.edu/]) (27a).
elisas. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) was used to determine the 50% effective concentration (ec50) of four-domain scd4 binding to
gp120. gp120 proteins of r3a,  xxxg2239xxx , and v3(9,9) were expressed in 293t cells
using recombinant vaccinia virus vectors and purified by galanthus nivalis lectin
chromatography (vector laboratory, burlingame, ca) as previously described
(56). purified gp120 at 100 ng per well was adsorbed onto immunolon 2hb
96-well plates (thermo labsystems, waltham, ma) in elisa capture buffer
(0.15 m  xxxd3212xxx , 0.35 m sodium bicarbonate in phosphate-buffered
saline (pbs; ph 9.6) overnight at 4°c. wells were washed with pbs–0.05%
tween and then blocked with 2% bovine  xxxg124xxx  in pbs for 1 h at 4°c.
starting at 25 ␮g/ml, fivefold dilutions of scd4 were made in blocking solution,
added to the plate at 100 ␮l/well, and allowed to bind for 2 h at 4°c. after a
washing step, okt4 antibody at 1 ␮g/ml was added and allowed to bind for 2 h
at 4°c. okt4 was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse igg. the optical density at 450 nm was measured by using an  xxxg22xxx 
revelation microplate reader (dynex technologies, chantilly, va). ec50s were
calculated and analyzed by using a two-sided student t test in graphpad prism
4.0 (graphpad software, inc.).

mutations responsible for restoring function to a v3-truncated env protein. we previously reported that replacing the
central 15 amino acids from the v3 loop of the r5x4 hiv-1
strain r3a with a three-residue gag linker resulted in a
poorly functional env, termed v3(9,9), with this designation
describing a v3 loop containing its first and last nine residues
in addition to the cysteine residues at the base of the loop (31).
however, function was eventually restored upon passaging this

adaptive mutations in  xxxg2239xxx  function. we found that the v3
loop truncation alone accounted for resistance to ccr5 antagonists. a subset of the adaptive mutations played a major
role in restoring function to v3(9,9), doing so via improved
utilization of cd4. compared to the parental r3a env,  xxxg2239xxx 
bound to cd4 with slightly higher affinity, was more easily
induced to cause membrane fusion by incubation with soluble
cd4 (scd4), and was able to mediate infection of cells expressing low levels of cd4. in contrast, utilization of ccr5
was less efficient. thus, in this instance, loss of a region of the
v3 loop that is important for coreceptor interactions was compensated for, unexpectedly, not by restoring efficient use of
ccr5 but rather by enhanced use of cd4. improved interactions with cd4 might make induction and exposure of the
coreceptor binding site in the bridging sheet region of gp120
more efficient, enabling env to overcome its impaired ability to
interact with ccr5.

an n-linked glycosylation site relative to v3(9,9).

virus on supt1 cells expressing high levels of ccr5. the
adapted virus, termed  xxxg2239xxx  (for tissue culture adapted 1), retained the v3 loop truncation but exhibited greatly enhanced
membrane fusion activity compared to the unpassaged v3(9,9)
virus. in addition,  xxxg2239xxx  used ccr5 but not cxcr4 to mediate
infection, was highly resistant to ccr5 antagonists by virtue of
the ability to utilize drug-bound conformations of ccr5, and
was highly sensitive to neutralization by b12, a broadly neutralizing antibody targeting the cd4 binding site (31). relative
to the poorly functional v3(9,9) env,  xxxg2239xxx  contained five mutations, including deletion of residues ttkn in the v2 loop,
and a single amino acid change, t342a, in c3 near the base of
v3, both of which result in the loss of n-linked glycosylation
sites (table 1). the other adaptive mutations consisted of an
alanine-to-valine change at the tip of the truncated v3 loop,
r254k in the c2 region, and an a509v mutation at the n
terminus of the gp41 subunit. to identify the mutations responsible for the enhanced function of  xxxg2239xxx  and, more importantly, the mechanism by which an env protein can mediate
entry despite a significant deletion in the functionally important v3 loop, we singly and in combination introduced each of
the five mutations from the adapted clone  xxxg2239xxx  into the unadapted v3(9,9) background (table 1). in addition, we produced the reciprocal mutants and, subsequently, produced a
series of combination mutants.
the panel of env mutants was used to produce viral
pseudotypes that were normalized for p24 content, titrated on
supt1 cells expressing ccr5 to define the linear range of the
assay, and then used for comparative infection assays using
equivalent amounts of p24. western blot analyses indicated
that all envs were incorporated onto virions with approximately the same efficiency (data not shown). we found that the
t342a mutation in the v3(9,9) background restored infection
to 40% of  xxxg2239xxx  levels (fig. 1b), whereas the gvg mutation in

the v3 linker and the a509v mutation in gp41 enhanced
infection efficiency by a modest amount. the ⌬ttkn and
r254k mutations in the v2 loop and c2, respectively, did not
increase viral entry in this assay. experiments with various
combinations of  xxxg2239xxx  mutations revealed that t342a, in combination with either the gvg mutation in v3 or the a509v
mutation in gp41 restored viral entry in this single-cycle infection assay to the same levels as  xxxg2239xxx . conversely, restoring
these mutations to wt sequences in  xxxg2239xxx  reduced infectivity to
levels near that of v3(9,9) (fig. 1c). similar results were
obtained when using human 293t or  xxxd670xxx  cells expressing cd4
and ccr5, though overall infection levels were not as great as
those obtained with supt1.ccr5 cells.
growth kinetics of reengineered envelopes. based on the
results of the single cycle infection assays, we expected that
introduction of the t342a mutation along with either the
gvg or a509v mutation into replication competent v3(9,9)
virus would enhance replication to levels similar to that of the
 xxxg2239xxx  virus. however, while the double mutants t342a/gvg
and t342a/a509v, as well as the triple mutant t342a/gvg/
a509v, replicated efficiently on supt1 cells that expressed
ccr5 and the c-type lectin dc-signr, they did so with
delayed kinetics (fig. 2). consistent with this,  xxxg2239xxx -infected
cultures were characterized by extensive cytopathic effects and
very large syncytia during the first 3 to 5 days postinfection,
while few syncytia were observed in cultures infected with the
triple mutant until more than 7 days postinfection. for all
viruses, the pattern of replication was similar for virus inputs of
5 ng (fig. 2) or 50 ng (data not shown), with the only difference
being the time to peak rt levels. therefore, while the t342a
mutation, along with either the gvg or a509v mutations,
played the greatest role in restoring function to the v3(9,9)
env, the remaining two adaptive mutations make functional

impact of  xxxg2239xxx  adaptive mutations on sensitivity to ccr5
inhibitors. one of the most striking features of the  xxxg2239xxx  virus
is its complete resistance to ccr5 antagonists. previous experiments using the unadapted v3(9,9) env in cell-cell fusion
assays suggested that the v3 truncation alone was able to
impart some level of drug resistance. however, for  xxxg2239xxx  it was
not clear whether simple truncation of the v3 loop was solely
responsible for this phenotype or whether the adaptive mutations contributed to ccr5 antagonist resistance. to examine

this, we performed infection assays using viral pseudotypes
bearing r3a or  xxxg2239xxx  envs or envs containing combinations of
the most important adaptive mutations in the v3(9,9) background. unfortunately, infection levels obtained with the unadapted v3(9,9) env were too low to measure in this assay.
infection assays were performed on supt1.ccr5 cells in
the presence of increasing concentrations of the ccr5 antagonist  xxxd2542xxx  (fig. 3). as expected, viral pseudotypes with
the r3a env were fully inhibited by  xxxd2542xxx , whereas  xxxg2239xxx 
pseudotypes were completely resistant. we found that all viruses bearing the v3 loop truncation were fully resistant to

mechanism of enhanced function via altered interactions
with cd4 and ccr5. one mechanism to account for the enhanced sensitivity of  xxxg2239xxx  to antibodies that bind to the cd4
and coreceptor binding sites would be if these epitopes on
gp120 were more exposed as a result of the adaptive mutations.
if so,  xxxg2239xxx  might be able to more efficiently engage cd4 and/or
ccr5 and thus be able to infect cells expressing low levels of
receptor more efficiently. to investigate this, we used the dualinducible 293-affinofile cell line, in which the expression levels
of both cd4 and ccr5 are independently modulated via separate, inducible promoters (27a, 34, 49). in this cell line, increasing concentrations of the inducers minocycline and ponasterone a result in corresponding increases in cell surface

 xxxd2542xxx  regardless of the presence or absence of any adaptive mutations. when two of the most important adaptive mutations (t342a and a509v) were introduced into the parental
env r3a, full sensitivity to  xxxd2542xxx  was retained (data not
shown). taken together, these results indicate that the v3 loop
truncation introduced into the r3a env protein is largely or
entirely responsible for ccr5 antagonist resistance and is not
significantly modified by adaptive mutations that arose during
passaging in tissue culture.
impact of  xxxg2239xxx  adaptive mutations on sensitivity to mabs
and scd4.  xxxg2239xxx  is exquisitely sensitive to neutralization by the
broadly neutralizing mab b12, which engages the cd4 binding
site on gp120 (31), and is even more sensitive to mab 17b,
which binds to the bridging sheet region, probably due to
enhanced exposure of this functionally important domain. although the adaptive mutations gvg, t342a and a509v did
not obviously contribute to the ccr5 antagonist resistance
phenotype, we found that they did play a role in the pronounced neutralization sensitivity of  xxxg2239xxx . viral pseudotypes
were preincubated with mab b12 prior to incubation with
supt1.ccr5 cells. three days later, cells were lysed and the
amount of luciferase activity determined. as we have reported
previously,  xxxg2239xxx  was more than 100-fold more sensitive to
neutralization by b12 than parental r3a (fig. 4a). in comparison, v3(9,9) envs containing two or three of the five adaptive mutations in  xxxg2239xxx  exhibited intermediate neutralization
phenotypes (fig. 4a). viruses containing the unadapted
v3(9,9) env did not infect cells sufficiently well to determine
accurate 50% inhibitory concentrations (ic50s). these data
argue that while the v3 truncation by itself largely accounts for
the resistance of  xxxg2239xxx  to ccr5 antagonists, it is the combination of the v3 loop truncation and the adaptive changes that
increase sensitivity to b12, perhaps by increasing exposure of
the cd4 binding site. indeed,  xxxg2239xxx  was approximately two-logs
more sensitive to neutralization by scd4 than r3a (fig. 4b).
however, the adaptive changes did not contribute strongly to
this phenotype. instead, the v3 truncation alone was primarily
responsible for the enhanced sensitivity of  xxxg2239xxx  to scd4,
whose binding site on gp120 overlaps but is not identical to the
b12 epitope.
the adaptive mutations found in  xxxg2239xxx  also played a role in
enhancing sensitivity to neutralization by mab 17b, which
binds to the cd4-induced bridging sheet region of gp120 (30).
although r3a is resistant to mab 17b, all v3 truncationcontaining envs were sensitive to the antibody. however,
v3(9,9) envs bearing two or three adaptive mutations were not
as sensitive to neutralization by mab 17b as was the fully
adapted  xxxg2239xxx  env (fig. 4c). if the v3 truncation were solely
responsible for enhanced sensitivity to 17b, then we would
expect the double and triple mutants to be neutralized by 17b
as efficiently as  xxxg2239xxx , but this was not seen. this suggests that
that the v3 truncation likely plays a central role in sensitivity to
mab 17b but that the adaptive mutations that confer greater
replication capacity on the truncated env substantially increase
sensitivity to this bridging sheet-directed mab. in summary,
the adaptive mutations in  xxxg2239xxx  result in increased sensitivity to
neutralization by mabs b12 and 17b (but not to scd4), which
bind to regions in gp120 that are involved in cd4 and coreceptor binding, respectively.

expression levels of cd4 and ccr5, respectively. by using six
concentrations of minocycline and eight concentrations of ponasterone a, a matrix of 48 different expression levels of cd4
and ccr5 can be assayed. quantitative flow cytometry was
used to confirm that the expression levels of receptor and
coreceptor were reproducible and consistent among experiments. expression levels in response to graded doses of inducer varied from ⬃2,000 to ⬃110,000 copies of cd4 per cell,
while ccr5 varied from ⬃1,200 to ⬃22,000 copies per cell.
primary human cd4⫹ t cells typically express between 50,000
and 70,000 copies of cd4 per cell, while ccr5 expression
levels tend to be quite variable between individuals, though are
typically less than 14,000 copies per cell (36). thus, expression
levels of both cd4 and ccr5 spanned a physiological range in
response to induction.

pseudotyped viruses bearing the r3a,  xxxg2239xxx  or panel of
v3(9,9) envs containing key adaptive mutations were used to
infect the panel of variably induced 293-affinofile cells, with
each condition being performed in duplicate within each experiment, and each experiment being replicated at least four
times. we found that the parental r3a virus was able to infect
cells expressing low levels of ccr5, but only if a threshold
level of cd4 was expressed (fig. 5a). if cd4 levels were low,
r3a was unable to infect, even if ccr5 levels were high. in
contrast,  xxxg2239xxx  was able to infect cells expressing very low levels
of cd4 but was much more sensitive than r3a to ccr5
expression levels. infection mediated by the v3(9,9) env was
both inefficient [note the scale of the y axis: v3(9,9) exhibited
a signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 10:1] and required high
levels of both cd4 and ccr5. in comparing the infection

the 293-affinofile cell line, which can be induced to express graded levels of cd4 and ccr5 in response to minocycline and ponasterone a,
respectively, was used to measure infection of viral pseudotypes at 48 combinations of cd4 and ccr5 expression levels. luciferase reporter viral
pseudotypes (10 to 20 ng) bearing the indicated envs were added to cells at 18 h postinduction, and the luciferase levels were measured at 72 h
postinfection. for infection with viral pseudotypes bearing the dualtropic env r3a, induced cells were treated with 10 nm amd3100 for 1 h prior
to infection. (a) infection levels of viral pseudotypes bearing the three parental envs are shown, with each bar representing the level of infection

ciency with which a viral env protein can be triggered by scd4
to elicit fusion with cells expressing coreceptor alone. we expressed the r3a,  xxxg2239xxx , v3(9,9), or the triple mutant env
proteins in qt6 cells and incubated them with qt6 cells expressing high levels of ccr5 in the presence of increasing
concentrations of scd4 (fig. 7a). under these conditions, all
env proteins were able to elicit cell-cell fusion, with r3a doing
so up to threefold more efficiently than  xxxg2239xxx  or the triple
mutant. however, both  xxxg2239xxx  and the triple mutant were triggered by lower concentrations of scd4 than was r3a, suggesting that the adaptive mutations enhance the sensitivity of these
v3-loop deleted envs to scd4. however, the inability of  xxxg2239xxx 
or the triple-mutant env to achieve high levels of fusion even
with high concentrations of scd4 suggests that there are obstacles to efficient entry mediated by these envs after cd4 has
been bound in this context, most likely attributed to inefficient
use of ccr5 (fig. 5).
 xxxg2239xxx  entry is delayed at a step after cd4 engagement. if the
adaptive changes in  xxxg2239xxx  enhance its ability to both bind cd4
and to undergo subsequent conformational changes more efficiently, then virions bearing the  xxxg2239xxx  env protein should

pattern of v3(9,9) to that of  xxxg2239xxx , it is evident that the adaptive
mutations acquired by  xxxg2239xxx  improved its infection efficiency by
greater than 1 log, enhanced the ability of the virus to utilize
low levels of cd4, but had no obvious impact on ccr5 utilization. to quantify this, the complex infection data generated
by the 293-affinofile cells were mathematically fitted to threedimensional surface plots and used to derive a sensitivity vector that describes the relative dependence of virus entry on
cd4 and ccr5 levels (see accompanying report by johnston
et al. [27a]). the angle of this vector (␪) is a numerical description of whether a virus is most sensitive to changes in cd4
or ccr5 levels. the greater the angle, the greater the dependence on ccr5 levels for virus entry. thus,  xxxg2239xxx  had a vector
angle of 69°, reflecting its greater dependence on ccr5 levels
while being able to use low cd4 levels, while r3a had a vector
angle of 22°, reflecting its greater dependence on cd4 levels
and ability to utilize low ccr5 levels (fig. 5b). when various
adaptive mutations were introduced into v3(9,9) singly and in
combination, it was evident that the adaptive mutations progressively increased the vector angle, indicating that a509v,
t342a, and the v3-linker gvg mutations each improved
cd4 utilization, with double and triple mutants showing a
combinatorial effect. for reasons that we do not understand,
results with v3(9,9) containing the a509v mutation were
highly variable.
the results with the affinofile cells were confirmed in part by
performing inhibition studies with antibodies to ccr5 (data
not shown). we found that  xxxg2239xxx  entry was more sensitive than
r3a to antibodies that bind to the second extracellular loop
(ecl2) of ccr5, a domain that is important for gp120 binding
(13, 14, 60, 64), as well as by antibodies to the n-terminal
domain of ccr5. the ic50 for  xxxg2239xxx  was fivefold lower than
that of r3a for mab  xxxd825xxx , whose epitope includes residues at
the base of ecl2 (35, 64). similarly, the ic50 for  xxxg2239xxx  was 15to 20-fold lower than that of r3a for mabs 45529 and 45531,
which recognize the c-terminal portion of ecl2 (35). thus,
antibodies that block ccr5 domains important for gp120
binding and thereby reduce the levels of available ccr5 on the
target cell have a greater effect on  xxxg2239xxx  entry, confirming that
 xxxg2239xxx  is more sensitive than r3a to levels of ccr5 on target
cells.
 xxxg2239xxx  adaptations confer slightly increased affinity for cd4.
the ability of  xxxg2239xxx  to more efficiently utilize low levels of cd4
to infect cells could be due to enhanced affinity. to test this,
monomeric r3a, v3(9,9) or  xxxg2239xxx  gp120 proteins were captured directly onto 96-well elisa plates. increasing concentrations of 4-domain scd4 were added to the captured gp120
and detected with the mab okt4, which recognizes a membrane-proximal epitope of cd4 (53). the ec50 for  xxxg2239xxx  was
48.5 ng of scd4/ml, compared to r3a at 156.1 ng/ml and
v3(9,9) at 120.5 ng of scd4/ml (fig. 6a). in addition, we
found that  xxxg2239xxx  was slightly less sensitive than r3a to inhibition by mabs directed against cd4, suggesting that  xxxg2239xxx  is
able to bind cd4 with higher affinity (fig. 6b and data not
shown). finally, these differences were relatively slight, though
statistically significant and highly reproducible. besides affinity,
the ability of  xxxg2239xxx  to utilize low levels of cd4 for infection
could be due to postbinding effects, such as the induction of
conformational changes needed for coreceptor engagement.
one way that this can be determined is to measure the effi-

become resistant to antibodies that bind to cd4 more quickly
than virions bearing the parental r3a env protein. however,
the diminished ability of  xxxg2239xxx  to utilize ccr5 could translate
into a kinetic delay between cd4 binding and subsequent
ccr5 interactions, which could account for the enhanced sensitivity of  xxxg2239xxx  to enfuvirtide (31, 50). to test this, we modified
a single-cycle replication assay such that inhibitors of cd4
binding, ccr5 binding, or virus-cell fusion were added at

intervals after infection. in this assay, virus is spinoculated onto
target  xxxd670xxx .cd4.ccr5 cells at 4°c, which allows the virus to
contact the cell surface but prevents fusion and entry.
 xxxd670xxx .cd4.ccr5 cells were used due to their adherence to
substrate, making time of addition experiments with associated
medium changes more efficient. at time zero, the spinoculated
cells are transferred to 37°c with or without saturating concentrations of various inhibitors being added at different times.
since each inhibitor targets a specific step in viral entry, it is
possible to assess the relative rates at which virus binds to cd4
or ccr5 or undergoes membrane fusion.
under these conditions on  xxxd670xxx .cd4.ccr5 cells, mabs to
cd4 or ccr5, or the membrane fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide,
completely prevented infection by either r3a or  xxxg2239xxx  if added
prior to the addition of virus. when the various inhibitors were
added at different times after virus binding, we found that r3a
became progressively resistant to the neutralizing antibody to
cd4 (fig. 7b). after cd4 engagement, however, coreceptor
binding and fusion occurred in relatively quick succession, as
indicated by the nearly overlapping curves of r3a infection in
the presence of antibodies to ccr5 or enfuvirtide. thus, for
r3a, cd4 binding appears to be the rate-limiting step in the
entry process, a result that is consistent with fact that r3a
required relatively high levels of cd4 to support virus infection
(fig. 5). in contrast,  xxxg2239xxx  became resistant to the anti-cd4
mab very quickly, indicating that it binds to cd4 in a functionally irreversible fashion soon after binding to the cell surface (fig. 7c). however, there was an extensive lag phase
before  xxxg2239xxx  became resistant to anti-ccr5 mabs. like r3a,
there was a short lag between ccr5 binding and membrane
fusion as judged by resistance to enfuvirtide. this result indicates that  xxxg2239xxx  engages cd4 quickly, a finding consistent with
the affinofile cell data, as well as with the ease with which  xxxg2239xxx 
membrane fusion activity can be triggered by scd4. however,
after binding to cd4, it is evident that  xxxg2239xxx  binds to ccr5
inefficiently, which is consistent with the finding that high levels
of ccr5 are needed to support infection by this virus (fig. 5)
and by the fact that  xxxg2239xxx  is about 1 log more sensitive to
enfuvirtide than is r3a (31).
discussion
the central goals of this study were to examine how env
function can be restored via adaptive mutations after deletion
of a significant portion of the v3 loop, and to determine
whether mutations that restore env function contribute to
ccr5 inhibitor resistance or the marked sensitivity exhibited
by  xxxg2239xxx  to neutralization by the cd4 binding site mab b12.
functionally, the v3 loop plays the major role in determining
whether env uses ccr5, cxcr4 or both coreceptors to infect
cells (6, 7, 57). structural studies indicate that in the cd4bound conformation the v3 loop extends from the surface of
gp120 by ⬃30 å (24), a distance thought to be sufficient for the
tip of the v3 loop to engage the ecls of the coreceptor, while
the base of the v3 loop and the adjoining bridging sheet
engage the n-terminal domain of the coreceptor (9, 10, 21, 23,
24, 51). since coreceptor binding is critically important for
triggering the conformational changes needed for virus-membrane fusion, disruption of v3 loop-coreceptor interactions
can prevent virus infection. small molecule ccr5 and cxcr4

improved use of cd4 by a hiv-1 envelope with truncated v3

unusual phenotypes: complete resistance to ccr5 inhibitors
and markedly enhanced sensitivity to neutralization by the
cd4-binding site mab b12. in the case of ccr5 inhibitor
resistance, our results suggest that the v3 loop truncation
alone accounts for this phenotype. if so, by what mechanism
does this occur, and might v3 truncation always result in resistance to coreceptor inhibitors? the model we propose for
this phenotype has as its basis the well-known plasticity of
env-coreceptor interactions. a large number of structure-function studies are consistent with a two-step binding model, in
which the v3 loop engages the ecls of ccr5 (with the second ecl being particularly important) while the n terminus of
ccr5 binds to the base of the v3 loop and the bridging sheet,
with sulfated tyrosine residues in ccr5 playing a central role
(9, 10, 18, 23, 24, 38, 45). nonetheless, this model is subject to
variability: some envs are more sensitive to mutations in the n
terminus of ccr5, while others are more sensitive to mutations in the ecls (14). the picture that emerges is a two-step
binding model in which the contributions of each binding event
(n terminus versus ecls) to inducing membrane fusion vary
to some degree between virus strains. we propose that r3a is
better able to utilize the n-terminal domain of ccr5 than
many other viruses. thus, loss of the distal portion of the v3
loop, with the concomitant loss of interactions with the ccr5
ecls, is tolerated to some degree. in contrast, similar deletions in other virus strains usually result in a complete loss of
function (19, 54, 65, 67, 69). since small molecule ccr5 inhibitors bind to a hydrophobic pocket in the transmembrane
helices of the coreceptor, they may preferentially disrupt the
conformation of the ecls (15, 39, 55, 61–63). if this model is
correct, then viruses that can engage the n-terminal domain of
the coreceptor more efficiently than other virus strains may
continue to engage ccr5 even in its drug-bound conformation. our limited structure-function studies with ccr5 mutants and  xxxg2239xxx  are consistent with this model. thus, provided
that a virus can tolerate loss of the distal portion of the v3
loop, it may very well exhibit resistance to ccr5 inhibitors in
the context of reduced overall function. consistent with this,
an hiv-2 strain that functions well despite loss of its v3 loop
also exhibits complete resistance to ccr5 inhibitors (37).
although the adaptive mutations in  xxxg2239xxx  made little or no
contribution to ccr5 inhibitor resistance, they clearly contributed to the sensitivity of  xxxg2239xxx  to neutralization by the cd4
binding site mab b12. it is tempting to speculate that the
enhanced ability of  xxxg2239xxx  to both bind and respond to cd4 is
linked to its enhanced sensitivity to a cd4 binding site antibody. if the cd4 binding site becomes more exposed as a
consequence of partial v3 loop truncation coupled with adaptive mutations, including the loss of two n-linked glycosylation
sites, then enhanced sensitivity to neutralization would likely
result. a crystal structure of an unliganded hiv-1 gp120 would
be needed to more fully understand the contributions of the
adaptive mutations to increased sensitivity to mab b12.
in summary, we find that deletions in the v3 loop that
abrogate important interactions with ccr5 are partially compensated for by mutations that enhance interactions with cd4,
the step in the virus entry pathway that is immediately upstream of coreceptor binding. how enhanced cd4 binding can
compensate for less efficient ccr5 interactions is not clear,
but might be related to the cooperative nature of the mem-

antagonists disrupt these interactions via an allosteric mechanism in which coreceptor conformation is altered (15, 39, 55,
61, 62), while genetic truncation of the v3 loop directly impacts env-coreceptor interactions.  xxxg2239xxx  provides a useful
model to study the plasticity of env-coreceptor interactions as
it efficiently utilizes ccr5 even in the presence of saturating
concentrations of potent ccr5 antagonists.
theoretically, the adaptive changes in  xxxg2239xxx  env could enhance function via several mechanisms. the most obvious,
perhaps, would be for mutations in  xxxg2239xxx  to enhance ccr5
interactions by increasing binding affinity or by making env
more susceptible to the conformational changes that are induced by ccr5 binding. our results are not consistent with
either of these models, although the assays available to assess
these functions are indirect and not as quantitative as we would
like. that  xxxg2239xxx  interacts with ccr5 less efficiently than r3a is
suggested by the fact that its fusion activity is reduced in most
contexts and by the finding that while r3a can mediate infection of cells expressing low levels of ccr5,  xxxg2239xxx  cannot. similarly, our time of addition studies with various hiv entry
inhibitors revealed that after binding cd4, r3a quickly engages ccr5. in contrast, a lag phase of ⬃60 min follows cd4
binding for  xxxg2239xxx  before it irreversibly engages ccr5. however, do the mutations present in  xxxg2239xxx  enable it to interact with
ccr5 more efficiently than the unadapted v3(9,9) env? due
to the poor function exhibited by v3(9,9), our data on this
point are not conclusive. if the adaptive changes present in
 xxxg2239xxx  improved its ability to utilize ccr5, we would anticipate
that  xxxg2239xxx  would be able to infect cells that express low levels of
ccr5 more efficiently than the unadapted v3(9,9) env. our
results with the affinofile cell system suggest that this is not the
case:  xxxg2239xxx  and v3(9,9) were similarly dependent upon ccr5
expression levels under conditions in which cd4 was not limiting, with neither being able to mediate infection of cells
expressing low levels of ccr5 regardless of cd4 expression
levels.
while our results argue that the adaptive changes in  xxxg2239xxx  do
not enhance ccr5 utilization, we found clear evidence that,
relative to r3a and v3(9,9),  xxxg2239xxx  exhibits enhanced ability to
bind cd4 and to undergo cd4-induced conformational
changes. this conclusion is supported by several lines of evidence. first, provided that sufficiently high levels of ccr5
were expressed,  xxxg2239xxx  was able to mediate infection of cells
expressing low levels of cd4 more efficiently than either r3a
or v3(9,9). second,  xxxg2239xxx  gp120 bound to scd4 with higher
affinity than r3a or v3(9,9) gp120, although this does not
necessarily mean that trimeric  xxxg2239xxx  env binds cd4 with
greater affinity than r3a. however, time of addition studies
with antibodies that bind cd4 and block infection indicated
that virions expressing the  xxxg2239xxx  env engaged cell surface cd4
more quickly than did the parental r3a virus, which is consistent with enhanced affinity. finally, the membrane fusion
activity of  xxxg2239xxx  could be triggered by low levels of scd4. taken
together, these results indicate that the adaptive mutations
that arose in v3(9,9) upon passaging on supt1 cells, ultimately
giving rise to  xxxg2239xxx , did so at least in part by not only enhancing
the ability of env to bind to cd4, but to undergo cd4-induced
conformational changes.
in addition to the fact that  xxxg2239xxx  functions relatively well
despite lacking much of its v3 loop, it exhibits two other

brane fusion reaction. it is likely that for membrane fusion to
occur, an env trimer will have to bind multiple cd4 and
coreceptor molecules (29, 43, 48). in addition, membrane fusion may also require the concerted action of several env
trimers (40), though some models suggest that a single trimer
might be sufficient to form a fusion pore (68). by binding to
cd4 more quickly, the coreceptor binding sites in  xxxg2239xxx  env
trimers should be induced more efficiently, making subsequent
interactions with ccr5 possible. associated with this phenotype is exquisite sensitivity to the broadly neutralizing mab
b12. if this property is due to enhanced exposure of the cd4
binding site, v3-truncated and adapted envs could be explored
for their abilities to induce antibodies against this conserved
and functionally important region.
