pancreatic cancer is the most lethal of all solid tumors partially
because of its chemoresistance. although gemcitabine is widely
used as a ﬁrst selected agent for the treatment of this disease despite low response rate, molecular mechanisms of gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer still remain obscure. the aim of this
study is to elucidate the mechanisms of gemcitabine resistance.
the 81-fold gemcitabine resistant variant miapaca2-rg was
selected from pancreatic cancer cell line miapaca2. by microarray analysis between miapaca2 and miapaca2-rg, 43 genes
(0.04%) were altered expression of more than 2-fold. the most
upregulated gene in miapaca2-rg was ribonucleotide reductase
m1 subunit ( xxxg1991xxx ) with 4.5-fold up-regulation. transfection
with  xxxg1991xxx -speciﬁc rnai suppressed more than 90% of  xxxg1991xxx 
mrna and protein expression. after  xxxg1991xxx -speciﬁc rnai transfection, gemcitabine chemoresistance of miapaca2-rg was
reduced to the same level of miapaca2. the 18 recurrent pancreatic cancer patients treated by gemcitabine were divided into 2
groups by  xxxg1991xxx  levels. there was a signiﬁcant association
between gemcitabine response and  xxxg1991xxx  expression (p 5 0.018).
patients with high  xxxg1991xxx  levels had poor survival after gemcitabine treatment than those with low  xxxg1991xxx  levels (p 5 0.016).
 xxxg1991xxx  should be a key molecule in gemcitabine resistance in
human pancreatic cancer through both in vitro and clinical models.  xxxg1991xxx  may have the potential as predictor and modulator of
gemcitabine treatment.

pancreatic cancer remains one of the most malignant cancers.
although surgery is the only curative treatment currently available, over 80% of patients have advanced regional disease or distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis and less than 20% of the
patients are candidates for resection.1 therefore, chemotherapy,
radiation or a combination of these therapies most commonly
plays an important role in pancreatic cancer treatment. they have
not had a signiﬁcant impact on survival rates in recent decades,
however, despite many clinical trials.1
gemcitabine (20 ,20 -diﬂuorodeoxycytidine,  xxxd2188xxx , gemzar) has
been recognized as the standard ﬁrst-line chemotherapeutic agent
used in patients with pancreatic cancer, since it was shown to have
some meaningful impact on either survival or disease-related
symptoms when compared with 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-fu) in randomized trials.2 however, not more than 25% patients with pancreatic
cancer will beneﬁt from gemcitabine, a proportion that is slightly
less than in patients with other cancers.2 although gemcitabine in
combination with other various cytotoxic agents is being investigated, no randomized phase iii trial has yet established any survival beneﬁt for combination therapy when compared with gemcitabine alone.1,3 the major cause of this relative treatment failure
is thought to be tumor cell resistance to chemotherapy, whether it
is inherent or acquired.4
a variety of attempts have recently been undertaken in vitro to
detect the molecular markers of gemcitabine resistance. alterations involved in cell cycle regulation, proliferation or apoptosis,
such as mutated p53,5  xxxg251xxx ,6  xxxg2198xxx ,7 focal adhesion kinase8 and
publication of the international union against cancer

bnip3,9 have been described in a variety of cancers including
pancreatic cancer. nucleotide transporters were also described as
molecules related to the intracellular transport of extracellular
gemcitabine from outside.10,11 the  xxxg1991xxx 
subunit ( xxxg1991xxx ),12,13 ribonucleotide reductase m2 subunit ( xxxg1992xxx ),14,15
 xxxg611xxx  ( xxxg611xxx )16 and  xxxg400xxx  (cda)17 are
supposed to play a role in gemcitabine resistance of the variety of
cancer as metabolic enzymes of the drug. however, they remain still
controversial because of the lack of direct evidence based on either
in vitro gene transfer model systems or clinical data from patients
with pancreatic cancer.
variant cells with characteristics resistant to chemotherapeutic
agents have widely contributed to the investigation of molecular
mechanisms in chemoresistance.7,12,13,16,18,19 these chemoresistant variants are traditionally established by continuous drug exposure and gradually increased drug concentration. although drug
resistance can occur at many levels, including increased drug
efﬂux, drug inactivation, alterations in drug target, processing of
drug-induced damage and evasion of apoptosis,20 the advent of
recently established analytical technologies such as microarray
and protein array systems has opened up feasible opportunities to
identify molecules involved in drug resistance. indeed, microarray
analysis has become a key tool for characterizing gene expression
in a variety of experimental systems with chemoresistant variants
and has succeeded in identifying the molecules associated with
gemcitabine resistance using an oligonucleotide microarray system in vitro and in vivo.12,13,21
in this study, we developed gemcitabine-resistant cells from the
human pancreatic cancer cell lines and attempted to identify novel
genes involved in gemcitabine chemoresistance using an oligonucleotide microarray system covering 30,000 human oligonucleotides. furthermore, the detected candidate gene was also revealed
to be responsible for gemcitabine resistance by an rnai assay and
by clinical analysis of the patients treated with gemcitabine.

nakahira et al.

rockville, md). the pci6 cell line was a gift from dr. h. ishikawa (hokkaido university, sapporo, japan). all cell lines were
cultured at 37°c under 5% co2 in dmem (sigma chemical co.,
st. louis, mo) supplemented with 10% fbs (hyclone laboratories, inc., rockville, md) and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and
streptomycin. relative gemcitabine-sensitive cell lines, bxpc3,
psn1 and miapaca2 were used for the establishment of chemoresistant variants. gemcitabine-resistant cells were generated by exposure to gradually increasing concentrations of the drug for 2
months as described previously.12,22 the starting concentration
was 1 ng/ml gemcitabine. when cells adapted to the drug, the
gemcitabine concentration was increased. the ﬁnal concentrations
were 10 ng/ml gemcitabine for psn1 and 20 ng/ml gemcitabine
for bxpc3 and miapaca-2.
reagents
gemcitabine was kindly provided by eli lilly pharmaceuticals
(indianapolis, in). 5-fluorouracil (5-fu) was purchased from
sigma chemical co. gemcitabine and 5-fu were dissolved in distilled water and applied to cells at a concentration of less than
0.1% of the medium volume.
cytotoxicity assay
cell growth was assessed by the 3-(4-, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (mtt) (sigma chemical co.)
method.23 brieﬂy, 3 3 104 cells were seeded to a 96-well plate in
100 ll of medium and left overnight to adhere. several concentrations of the test drugs in 100 ll volumes were added, and the cells
were incubated for 48 hr. after treatment, 10 ll of mtt solution
(5 mg/ml) was added to each well and incubated for another 4 hr
at 37°c. then, 100 ll of acid-isopropanol was added, and after
24 hr at 4°c, reduced mtt was measured spectrophotomechanically in a dual beam microtiter plate reader at 570 nm with a 650
nm reference. resulting absorbencies were converted to percent
survival by comparing treated with untreated (100% survival)
cells. 50% inhibitory concentrations (ic50s) are deﬁned as the concentrations of drug that result in 50% cell survival when compared
with untreated cells.
growth curve
cells (1 3 104) were seeded to a 24-well plate in 1 ml of medium and left overnight to adhere. the medium was replaced daily
with 1 ml of fresh medium with or without gemcitabine at the
dose of parental ic50. cell numbers were counted with an automatic cell counter (celltec mek-5103, nihon kohden, tokyo,
japan) after being treated with trypsin.
animals and in vivo antitumor experiments
four-week-old female balb/c nu/nu mice were purchased
from japan clea (tokyo, japan) and maintained in speciﬁc pathogen-free conditions. human pancreatic tumor xenografts were prepared by subcutaneous implantation (5 3 106 cells; total volume
100 ll) of miapaca2 and miapaca2-rg, resistant variant established from miapaca2, into the right back of 10 nude mice each.
the animals were monitored for activity, physical condition,
determination of body weight and measurement of tumor volume
[1/2 3 (the major axis) 3 (the minor axis)2] every other day.
when the tumors reached a volume between 100 and 200 mm3,
mice were divided into the following 4 groups of 5 mice each: parental cell with no treatment, parental cell with weekly intraperitoneal injections of gemcitabine, resistant cell with no treatment, resistant cell with weekly intraperitoneal injections of gemcitabine.
gemcitabine was injected weekly into the peritoneal cavity at the
dose of 240 mg/kg as described.24
[3h] gemcitabine cellular uptake assay
cells were seeded to a ﬂat-bottomed 24-well microplate (1 3
104/well) and incubated for 24 hr. the medium was replaced by
1 ml of fresh medium by an additional 48 hr of culture. the cells

were then exposed to [3h] gemcitabine (moravek biochemicals, inc.
brea, ca) at a concentration of 23.9 ng/ml (1.0 lci/ml). after 1-hr
exposure, the cells were washed 3 times in 1 ml of ice cold phosphate-buffered saline (pbs). the cells were then dissolved in 0.5 ml
of 0.5% triton x-100, and 0.4 ml aliquots were sampled for radioactivity counting. aliquots of 20 ll were also sampled for protein
determination. the uptake level of [3h] gemcitabine was expressed
as radioactivity levels divided by protein concentrations measured
by the bradford method (bio-rad laboratories, hercules, ca).
oligonucleotide microarray
rna extraction was carried out with trizol reagent (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) using a single-step method,25 and rna
quality was checked with an rna 6000 nano labchip kit (agilent technologies, waldbronn, germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. an oligo-microarray covering 30,000 human
oligonucleotides (acegene human 30k; dna chip research inc.
and hitachi software engineering co., ltd., yokohama, japan)
was used in this study.26 sample preparation, hybridization and
wash were carried out according to the manufacturer’s protocols
(http://www.dna-chip.co.jp/thesis/acegeneprotocol.pdf). a sample and the reference were labeled with cy5-dutp and cy3-dutp
(amersham pharmacia biotech, piscataway, nj), respectively,
mixed, and hybridized on a microarray. the hybridized array was
scanned using scanarray 4000 (gsi lumonics) at wavelengths
corresponding to each probe’s unique ﬂuorescence (635 and
532 nm for cy5 and cy3, respectively). the signal intensity of
each spot (16 bit tiff image) was converted into text format by
dnasisarray software (hitachi software inc., tokyo, japan).
data processing was performed through background subtraction
using the average blank spot intensity in each block. if the signal
was higher than the background and the signal levels of cy3 and
cy5 were higher than 1,000, these data were used for further analysis. at this stage, 10,517 genes remained. the cy3/cy5 ratio values of each spot were log-transformed and normalized so that the
median cy3/cy5 ratio of whole genes was 1.0.27
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
rna extraction was carried out with trizol reagent (invitrogen,
carlsbad, ca), and cdna was generated with avian myeloblastosis
virus reverse transcriptase (promega, madison, wi), as described previously.25 in this assay, porphobilinogen deaminase (pbgd) mrna
was used as an internal control.28 pcr was performed in a 25-ll
reaction mixture containing 2 ll of cdna template, 13 perkinelmer pcr buffer, 1.5 mm mgcl2, 0.8 mm deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 0.2 lm each primer and 1 u of taq dna polymerase
(amplitaq gold, roche molecular system, inc.). the primers for
pbgd were synthesized as described previously.28 the pcr primers
used for the detection were as follows:  xxxg611xxx  (forward primer,

and extension at 72°c for 60 sec, and the products were run on 2%
agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. a quantitative gene expression assay was performed using lightcycler
(idaho technology, salt lake city, ut), as described previously.29
pcr was performed with cycling conditions of 95°c for 10 min,
followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°c for 10 sec, annealing

quantiﬁcation data from each sample were analyzed using the
lightcycler analysis software (roche diagnostics, mannheim, germany) as recommended by the manufacturer. relative gene expression levels are expressed as quantiﬁed gene expression divided by
quantiﬁed pbgd levels.

cells grown to subconﬂuence in 90-mm dishes were lysed in
protease inhibitor (1 mm pmsf, 40 lm leupeptin) containing
pbs. after sonication, aliquots containing 50 lg of total protein
were size-fractionated by sds-page (5–20% gradient gels), and
the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidine diﬂuoride membranes (immobilon, millipore, bedford, ma) as described previously.25 the membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk and

30 min at room temperature with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. after further 5 washings peroxidase
was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence system from
amersham (arlington heights, il).
rnai treatment
 xxxg1991xxx  and control rnais were purchased from invitrogen
(stealth rnai; invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). the  xxxg1991xxx -speciﬁc
rnai designed by block-it rnai designer (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) was as follows: sense 50 -ggauauuguucuggccaauaaagau-30 ; anti-sense 50 -aucuuuauuggccagaacaauaucc-30 . a stealth rnai negative control with medium
gc duplex was used as a control. rnais were dissolved in
depc-treated water to make a 20 lm working stock. one day
before transfection, 2 3 105 cells were plated into 35 mm, 6-well
trays and allowed to adhere. transfection was performed using
lipofectamine 2000 transfection regent (invitrogen, carlsbad,
ca) following invitrogen’s protocols. the ability of the rnai
molecules to knock down  xxxg1991xxx  expression was analyzed by
mrna and protein detection, and the ﬁnal dilution volume of
rnai was 50 pmol in 500 ll optimem medium per well.
patients and tissue samples
eighteen recurrent pancreatic cancer patients in osaka university hospital were recruited. all patients had undertaken curative
resection at osaka university hospital between september 1999
and february 2004 and were followed-up without any adjuvant
treatment until recurrence. the tumor tissues had been collected
and stored at 280°c until use under informed written consent.
each tumor was conﬁrmed histopathologically to be advanced
stage cancer. all patients had a measurable recurrent lesion and
were treated with only gemcitabine after recurrence. response to
gemcitabine was deﬁned as follows: complete response (cr), partial response (pr), stable disease (sd) and progressive disease
(pd). this classiﬁcation was based on new guidelines to evaluate
the response to treatment in solid tumors (recist guide-

lines).30 patients were divided into 2 groups based on the chemotherapeutic response. responders were deﬁned as cr, pr and sd.
nonresponders were pd. a total of 18 tumor samples resected at
the primary curative operation were analyzed to determine  xxxg1991xxx 
mrna expression levels. total rna was isolated from the homogenate tumor samples using trizol method27 for quantitative
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) using
same conditions as already described. total rna of miapaca2rg was used for analytical curve.
statistical analysis
statistical analyses were performed using the spss 11.5j
software (spss inc., chicago, il). all data were expressed as
mean 6 sd. differences between groups were examined for
statistical signiﬁcance using the student’s t test. in the clinical
study, associations between the candidate molecule expression
and gemcitabine response were assessed by fisher’s exact test.
overall, survival probabilities were estimated using the
kaplan-meier method, and the log-rank test was used to determine the level of signiﬁcance between the survival curves. a
p value less than 0.05 denoted the presence of a statistically signiﬁcant difference.
results
establishment of gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic
cancer cell lines
three types of pancreatic cancer cell lines, bxpc3, psn1 and
miapaca2, were cultured in the medium containing gemcitabine
for 2 months. after selection, we established 3 variant cells resistant to gemcitabine with different degrees with the mtt assay
(table i). the selected cell lines were called bxpc3-rg, miapaca2-rg or psn1-rg, based on the names of their parental cell
line. on the basis of the ic50 measurement, bxpc3-rg, miapaca2-rg and psn1-rg were 11-fold, 81-fold and 986-fold
more resistant than parental cells to the cytotoxic effects of gemcitabine, respectively. bxpc3-rg and psn1-rg were also cross-resistant to 5-fu, although miapaca2-rg represented no signiﬁcant

cross-resistance (table i). by the growth curve analysis, miapaca2-rg and psn1-rg showed signiﬁcant resistant to gemcitabine, although bxpc3-rg did not show any resistance to gemcitabine. in the absence of gemcitabine, bxpc3-rg and miapaca2rg demonstrated almost the same growth curves when compared
with parental cells, although psn1-rg’s growth rate was 10-fold
slower than psn1 (fig. 1a). bxpc3-rg and miapaca2-rg preserved the cell morphology of parental cells regardless of these
chemoresistant alterations, and psn1-rg showed signiﬁcant difference in the cell morphology (fig. 1b). miapaca2-rg remained
gemcitabine-resistant after 1 month culture in the medium without
gemcitabine. furthermore, miapaca2-rg showed signiﬁcant
gemcitabine-resistance when compared with miapaca2 in an
in vivo xenograft model (fig. 2). the level of [3h] gemcitabine
cellular uptake in miapaca2-rg (25.0 6 3.2 pg gem/lg protein)
is half of that in miapaca2 (49.9 6 5.8 pg gem/lg protein).
these data suggest that miapaca2-rg should be the most suitable
for identifying genetic alterations relating to gemcitabine resistance among the 3 types of gemcitabine-selected variants. we
chose miapaca2-rg for further analysis to identify molecules
associated with gemcitabine resistance.

microarray analysis
to investigate the candidate genes involved in gemcitabine resistance, oligo-microarray experiments were carried out with miapaca2 and miapaca2-rg cells. out of the 30,000 spotted genes,
10,517 genes were used for further analysis (see material and
methods). scatter plotting showed that 99.6% genes (10,474 genes
out of 10,517 genes) had altered expressions of less than 2-fold,
and 43 genes were up- or downregulated more than 2-fold in miapaca2-rg cells when compared with miapaca2 cells (fig. 3).
among the 43 genes in which 12 upregulated genes and 31 downregulated genes were identiﬁed, the  xxxg1991xxx  was the most upregulated with 4.5-fold (table ii). this gene is the subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (rr) considered as an enzyme associated with
gemcitabine metabolism.4 this upregulation was validated by
both quantitative rt-pcr and western blotting (data not shown).
other subunits of rr,  xxxg1992xxx  and  xxxg1993xxx , and other enzymes
involved in gemcitabine metabolism such as cda,  xxxg611xxx , ctp synthetase and dcmp deaminase and nucleotide transporters were not
chosen in the microarray analysis because of their low expression
levels or failure to show any altered expression between miapaca2 and miapaca2-rg with quantitative rt-pcr. the func-

chemosensitivity after  xxxg1991xxx -speciﬁc rnai transfection
to verify that  xxxg1991xxx  should be involved in gemcitabine resistance, rnai experiments were carried out on miapaca2 and miapaca2-rg. the ability of  xxxg1991xxx -speciﬁc rnai to suppress
 xxxg1991xxx  expression was conﬁrmed by both rt-pcr (figs. 4a and
4b) and western blotting (fig. 4c). after transfection with rrm1speciﬁc rnai, more than 90% suppression of  xxxg1991xxx  was
observed (fig. 4a). other subunits of ribonucleotide reductase,
 xxxg1992xxx  and  xxxg1993xxx , did not have any signiﬁcant mrna expression
change.  xxxg1991xxx -speciﬁc rnai transfection did not bring about any
major effect on cell viability. after  xxxg1991xxx -speciﬁc rnai transfection, the gemcitabine chemoresistance of miapaca2-rg was signiﬁcantly reduced to same level as that of miapaca2, and gemcitabine response of miapaca2 also became more sensitive (fig. 5).

tions of other up- and downregulated genes were not considered to
have any association with gemcitabine sensitivity. therefore, we
focused on the  xxxg1991xxx  gene for further functional analysis.

 xxxg1991xxx  expression and gemcitabine response in human
pancreatic cancer cells and patients with pancreatic cancer
to investigate that the increased expression also should be
involved in intrinsic resistance to gemcitabine, we examined the
association between  xxxg1991xxx  mrna expression levels and gemcitabine sensitivity of 5 human pancreatic cancer cell lines at ﬁrst.
 xxxg1991xxx  mrna expression levels are signiﬁcantly associated with
gemcitabine sensitivity in 5 pancreatic cancer cell lines (fig. 6),
although increased expression of  xxxg1991xxx  was not likely correlated
with the increase of cellular resistance to gemcitabine between
acquired gemcitabine resistant miapaca2-rg cells and psn1-rg
cells. next, we examined the correlation of  xxxg1991xxx  mrna expression levels with clinical course of 18 patients with recurrent pancreatic cancer. seven patients developed liver metastasis, 4 developed local recurrence, 3 developed lymph node metastasis, 2
developed lung metastasis and 2 developed multi site recurrence
(1 patient had local recurrence and liver metastasis and the other
had liver, lung, bone and lymph node metastasis). the response to
gemcitabine were cr (n 5 0), pr (n 5 2), sd (n 5 6) and pd
(n 5 10). we classiﬁed 8 patients as responders (pr and sd) and
10 patients as nonresponders (pd). on the other hand, the median
 xxxg1991xxx  mrna expression relative to the housekeeping gene
pbgd was 1.3 3 1022 (minimum expression, 0.0 3 1022; maximum expression, 132.0 3 1022) in 18 pancreatic tissue samples
(fig. 7). according to a cut-off value of 1.3 3 1022, 9 patients
(50%) were classiﬁed into the low  xxxg1991xxx  expression group, and 9
patients (50%) into the high  xxxg1991xxx  expression group. there was a
signiﬁcant association between gemcitabine response and  xxxg1991xxx 
expression (p 5 0.018) (table iii). furthermore, patients with

high  xxxg1991xxx  levels had poor survival times after gemcitabine treatment than those with low  xxxg1991xxx  levels (fig. 8; p 5 0.016). median survival times after gemcitabine treatment was 6.0 months
for patients with high  xxxg1991xxx  levels and 14.6 months for patients

discussion
the present study have demonstrated that  xxxg1991xxx , which is  xxxg220xxx  of ribonucleotide reductase (one of the key enzymes in gemcitabine metabolism), should be clearly involved in gemcitabine resistance in human pancreatic cancer. first, oligonucleotide microarray analysis covering 30,000 human oligonucleotides between
human pancreatic cancer cells resistant to gemcitabine and parental
cells demonstrated that the most upregulated gene in the gemcitabine-resistant variant miapaca2-rg cells was the  xxxg1991xxx  gene.
 xxxg1991xxx  expression in the resistant cells was 4.5-fold higher than parental cells. this up-regulation was validated by quantitative rtpcr and western blotting. furthermore, there was no difference
between the expression levels of the other subunits of ribonucleotide reductase or the other molecules in gemcitabine metabolism
including  xxxg611xxx , ctp synthetase, dcmp deaminase and nucleotide
transporters. second, by  xxxg1991xxx -speciﬁc rnai transfection,  xxxg1991xxx 
expression in both mrna and protein levels were signiﬁcantly
decreased and the gemcitabine chemoresistance of miapaca2-rg
was signiﬁcantly reduced to same level as that of miapaca2. third,
the most important point was conﬁrmation by the clinical analysis.
increased  xxxg1991xxx  expression was signiﬁcantly associated with antitumor effects and with poor survival after treatment with gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer patients (p 5 0.018 and 0.016, respectively). therefore,  xxxg1991xxx  could be the targeted molecule to regulate
gemcitabine resistance. furthermore, its expression levels could be
a useful indicator of gemcitabine resistance.
ribonucleotide reductase (rr) acts as the rate-limiting enzyme
in de novo dna synthesis, because it is the only known enzyme
that converts ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, which step
is mandatory for dna polymerization and repair.31,32 in the cell,
a  xxxd1836xxx  analogue, gemcitabine, is phosphorylated to
monophosphate, diphosphate, and triphosphate before incorporation into dna, which is required for its growth inhibiting activity.
the diphosphorylated form of gemcitabine acts as a rr inhibitor,
and some of gemcitabine cytotoxic activity is due to this inhibition.33 ribonucleotide reductase increases the deoxynucleoside

triphosphate (dntp) pool in the cells, which could lead to
decreased incorporation of dntp analogues such as triphosphorylated gemcitabine into dna and might reduce the antitumor effect
of gemcitabine.22 in fact, miapaca2-rg, higher expresser of
 xxxg1991xxx  mrna, showed lower gemcitabine uptake than lower
 xxxg1991xxx  expresser miapaca2.
recent results have shown that there are 3 human ribonucleotide reductase subunits:  xxxg1991xxx ,  xxxg1992xxx  and  xxxg1993xxx .  xxxg1991xxx  is a
large peptide chain (a), and  xxxg1992xxx  and  xxxg1993xxx  are small protein
subunits of rr (b). the catalytically active form of eukaryotic
ribonucleotide reductase is proposed to be a a2b2 heterotetrameter
made up of 2 large subunits and 2 small subunits.34,35 although
ribonucleotide reductase enzymatic activity is modulated by levels
of rrm236 and  xxxg1993xxx ,37  xxxg1991xxx  could play a key role among the
3 subunits in the course of gemcitabine treatment.  xxxg1991xxx  controls
substrate speciﬁcity and global on/off enzyme activity.36,37 as
suggested by davidson et al.,  xxxg1991xxx  could act as a ‘‘molecular
sink’’ for gemcitabine, in which  xxxg1991xxx  binds irreversibly to the
drug and inactivates it, while increased  xxxg1991xxx  expression did not
alter ribonucleotide reductase activity in the gemcitabine resistant
variant human lung cancer cells.12  xxxg1991xxx  was upregulated in the
2 selected gemcitabine resistant human lung cancer cell lines,
where  xxxg1991xxx  expression levels were correlated with gemcitabine
concentration for cell selection.12 a recent microarray analysis

has suggested that in vivo induction of resistance to gemcitabine
should result in increased expression of  xxxg1991xxx .13 these data are
consistent with the present ﬁndings, although they only suggested
an association of gemcitabine resistance with higher  xxxg1991xxx  expression. more important was the clear demonstration in the present study of the direct association of  xxxg1991xxx  with gemcitabine resistance through  xxxg1991xxx -speciﬁc rnai treatment. however, the
precise mechanisms how the increased expression of  xxxg1991xxx  acts
in gemcitabine resistance still remain obscure. in the in vitro study
with acquired gemcitabine resistant miapaca2-rg and psn1-rg
cells, increase expression of  xxxg1991xxx  was not likely correlated with
the increase of cellular resistance to gemcitabine. although gemcitabine-resistance of psn1-rg cells was almost equal to that of
miapaca2-rg cells,  xxxg1991xxx  expression level was much higher in
miapaca2-rg than in psn1-rg cells. other molecules involving
gemcitabine or 5-fu metabolism or molecules such as p838 may
be participated in gemcitabine resistance. further studies are
needed to clarify these points.
although association of the increased expression of  xxxg1991xxx 
gene with gemcitabine resistance has been reported based on

in vitro and in vivo acquired gemcitabine resistant tumor cells12,13
as in the present study, the mechanisms under  xxxg1991xxx  upregulation
of resistant cells have not been fully elucidated. polymorphisms39
and ampliﬁed gene copy number40 in the  xxxg1991xxx  gene are supposed to be related to the gemcitabine chemoresistance of tumor
cells. gene mutation or epigenetic mechanism such as methylation
may inﬂuence the expression of  xxxg1991xxx  in resistant cells. our preliminary experiments, however, did not show any mutational or
polymorphic changes in the  xxxg1991xxx  gene between parental and
gemcitabine resistant selected cells. demethylation agents such as
5-aza-20 - xxxd1836xxx  did not change rrm1expression in gemcitabine resistant cells. future studies for the regulation of rrm1expression could therefore be helpful to obtain modulation of gemcitabine sensitivity in pancreatic cancer cells.
because the present ﬁndings on  xxxg1991xxx  as a factor in gemcitabine resistance are based on an in vitro acquired gemcitabine resistant model as shown in the previous studies,12 it is still unclear
whether or not  xxxg1991xxx  should be one of the key molecules
involved in the intrinsic resistance to gemcitabine. however, in
in vitro analysis with human pancreatic cancer cell lines,  xxxg1991xxx 
mrna expression levels are signiﬁcantly associated with gemcitabine sensitivity in 5 pancreatic cancer cell lines, while increased
expression of  xxxg1991xxx  was not likely correlated with the increase of
cellular resistance to gemcitabine between acquired gemcitabine
resistant miapaca2-rg cells and psn1-rg cells. furthermore,
clinical data from patients treated with gemcitabine may indicate
that  xxxg1991xxx  should play an important role in the intrinsic resistance
to gemcitabine. gemcitabine was more effective to recurrent
tumors in those patients with low  xxxg1991xxx  mrna expression in the
tumor obtained at surgery, although expression levels of recurrent
tumors were supposed to reﬂect those of primary tumors. therefore, patients with low  xxxg1991xxx  mrna expression might have a signiﬁcantly longer survival than those with a high expression as previously reported in lung cancer patients41,42 even though the survival of recurrent pancreatic cancer patients is generally poor.
although our data do not rule out that other molecules of gemcitabine resistance determine intrinsic or acquired sensitivity to gemcitabine in vivo as reported in the recent study, the clinical results
should be the most feasible for further investigations.
in conclusion, we have demonstrated in the present study that
 xxxg1991xxx  should be a key molecule in gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer through both in vitro and clinical models. in the
continuous struggle to overcome the chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer,  xxxg1991xxx  may have the potential to play the role of a predictor of gemcitabine resistance and modulator of gemcitabine
treatment.
