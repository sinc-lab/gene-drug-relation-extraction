cd20-targeted therapy:
the next generation of antibodies
tom van meertena and anton hagenbeekb
targeting the  xxxg1445xxx  on b lymphocytes with the monoclonal antibody (moab) rituximab has
greatly improved the outcome of patients with b-cell malignancies. despite the success of rituximab, resistance occurs in about half of the patients, resulting in non-response to treatment or early
relapse with the original disease. a better understanding of the mechanism of rituximab resistance
has led to the development of novel, improved anti-cd20 antibodies. this review describes the
development of cd20-targeted therapy from its historical background towards the next generation
of anti-cd20 moabs and explains new strategies to overcome resistance.

t

he goal of cd20-targeted therapy is to kill b
lymphocytes by the use of monoclonal antibodies (moabs) against the b-cell–specific human
cd20 molecule. clinical success started by targeting
non-hodgkin lymphoma (nhl) with rituximab, a chimeric anti-cd20 moab. the use of rituximab as a singleagent or in addition to chemotherapy in nhl patients is
considered to be one of the most successful and worldwide accepted forms of immunotherapy to date.
however, despite its success, resistance occurs in
about half of nhl patients, resulting in non-response to
treatment or early relapse of the original disease.
rituximab eliminates cd20⫹ cells mainly through
three different mechanisms: complement-dependent
cytotoxicity (cdc), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (adcc), and the induction of apoptosis. resistance to rituximab can be lymphoma-related or hostrelated. the preference for one of these mechanisms
depends on the patient-specific micro-environment of
the lymphoma. based on the physiology of these factors, new anti-cd20 antibodies are being developed.

geting from its historical background towards the next
generation of anti-cd20 monoclonal antibodies and
explains the new strategies to overcome resistance.

human cd20
the human cd20 molecule is a 33- to 37-kd, nonglycosylated phosphoprotein and its expression is restricted to the b-cell hematopoietic lineage.1–3 as
shown in figure 1, cd20 is expressed within key b-cell
development stages that give rise to b-cell nhl and
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll). cd20 is not expressed on hematopoietic stem cells or on plasma cells.
this means that targeting cd20 with moabs will not
significantly decrease the immunoglobulin production
against pathogens and will not harm the development
of new b-cells.
cd20 crosses the plasma membrane of b cells four
times, leaving two extracellular parts (figure 2). these
extracellular parts are ideal binding targets for  xxxd3132xxx  moab-based therapy for b-cell malignancies and
b-cell–related autoimmune diseases. other advantages
of targeting cd20 are that cd20 does not circulate in
the plasma,4 is not shed from the cell surface,5 and is
not internalized6 after antibody-binding.
although cd20 is universally the antigen most frequently antibody targeted, its exact function is still
unknown. actually, the  xxxg1445xxx  was discovered
through the generation of the first anti-cd20 moab.
balb/c mice were immunized with burkitt’s lymphoma
cells and a new antibody was formed, called anti-b1,
that recognized cd20.1 to date, no natural ligand is
known for cd20 and our current understanding of the
function of the cd20 molecule comes from ligation
with different antibodies to cd20.7–10 recent experiments suggest that cd20 is a calcium channel and is

directly associated with the b-cell antigen receptor
(bcr).11,12 cross-linking of cd20 with most anti-cd20
moabs results in the formation of detergent-insoluble
microdomains, called lipid rafts. these lipid rafts are
signaling platforms and, after binding of the moab,
cytosolic ca2⫹ levels increase through cd20 and signaling occurs through the bcr.11,12

development of the anti-cd20 antibody
rituximab and clinical application
the first moab that recognized cd20, the murine
anti-cd20 b1, was generated in 1980.1 subsequently,
because of their potential for the treatment of b-cell
disorders, anti-cd20 antibodies were genetically engineered for clinical application.
rituximab is a human-to-mouse chimeric monoclonal anti-cd20 antibody. to develop rituximab, mice
were immunized with a cd20⫹ lymphoma. this resulted in a murine antibody with high-affinity for cd20,
called 2b8 (idec-2b8). the light and heavy chain variable regions from 2b8 were amplified by polymerase
chain reaction (pcr) and inserted into a cdna expression vector that contained human igg1 heavy chain
and human ␬-light chain constant regions. this expression vector was transferred to chinese hamster ovary
cells, which resulted in stable expression and high
secretion of immunoglobulin levels.13 the resulting human-to-mouse chimeric antibody (c2b8, rituximab)
was purified and shown to bind human cd20 with high
affinity, and also to bind c1q, the first component of
the complement system, and to kill lymphoma cell
lines in the presence of human serum or activated
human effector cells. in addition, injection of rituximab
into cynomolgus monkeys resulted in depletion of b
cells in the peripheral blood and lymph nodes.13 these
results, presented by reff and colleagues in 1994, were
the first steps towards the initiation of clinical trials in
nhl patients.13
in 1997, rituximab ( xxxd3132xxx  [hoffmann la-roche,
switzerland], rituxan [genentech, usa]) was the first
moab approved specifically for the treatment of pa-

next generation of anti-cd20 monoclonal antibodies
tients with relapsed or refractory cd20⫹ low-grade
(follicular) nhl.
the first in man phase i trial with rituximab as a
single agent was conducted in 1993 in patients with
relapsed low-grade b-cell lymphoma.14 within five single-agent trials, no severe toxicities were found and
only infusion-related adverse events occurred within
the first hours, in particular after the first infusion.
adverse effects were chills, fever, nausea, fatigue, headache, and angioedema.15 in several phase ii and iii trials
the optimal schedules and dosing with or without chemotherapy, biological agents, and radiotherapy were
studied.15 after approval in 1997 in the united states
and in 1998 in europe, rituximab was included in the
standard treatment of nhl. rituximab works very efficiently in combination with chemotherapy. for diffuse
large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl), follicular lymphoma,
and mantle cell lymphoma, inclusion of rituximab
in standard chemotherapy regimens significantly improved patients’ outcome with or without pretreatment16 –25 and is accepted as a standard first-line therapy
for cd20⫹ lymphomas. moreover, if patients with lowgrade lymphoma respond to single-agent rituximab
therapy, progression-free and overall survival are substantially prolonged with scheduled maintenance treatment.26,27 in patients who achieved complete or partial
remission after the combination of chemotherapy and
rituximab, maintenance with rituximab increased overall and progression-free survival.25–28 in addition, rituximab maintenance in patients treated after standard
chemotherapy significantly increased the 3-year progression-free survival rate from 33% to 68%.28,29

mode of depletion of cd20ⴙ cells
in recent years, the investigation of the function and
structure of cd20 and the engineering of new  xxxd3132xxx  moabs have greatly increased knowledge of the
working mechanism of rituximab. in vitro experiments
and preclinical animal studies have demonstrated that
adcc is critical and that there may be a role for cdc
and also a direct effect of antibody binding to cd20,
leading to apoptosis. in the following paragraphs, each
mechanism is briefly discussed. for an extensive review of this subject we direct the reader to the article
by weiner in this issue of seminars in hematology.

rituximab and apoptosis
there are conflicting data concerning the theory
that the binding of rituximab to cd20 would lead to a
direct downstream signal resulting in apoptosis. various groups obtained different results, even if they used
similar target cell lines.7,30,31 the degree of apoptosis
probably depends on the sensitivity of a cell line and
the extent of cross-linking of rituximab. in general,
hyper-crosslinking of rituximab, either by a secondary

201

antibody or by fc-bearing effector cells, is believed to
increase the degree of apoptosis.7,32–34 there is no
consensus about the signaling route of cell death. one
of the key features of rituximab is that ligation to cd20
leads to the formation of lipid rafts. subsequent to lipid
raft formation there is an increase in cytosolic ca2⫹
levels, and higher intracellular ca2⫹ levels are important for the signal leading to apoptosis.35 it has been
shown in cll patients that one of the late apoptotic
pathways, caspase-3, is activated.36 in addition, stolz et
al demonstrated that rituximab binding activated
caspases via the mitochondrial pathway and that apoptosis depends on the degree of expression of antiapoptotic proteins within the mitochondria.37 however, others documented that the apoptosis does not
depend on the caspase or  xxxd3135xxx /fas death pathway
or on mitochondria, and does not require lipid raft
formation.30,38 although the degree of rituximab-mediated apoptosis was minimal, it has been suggested that
lysosomes were responsible for a cytoplasmic form of
cell death, correlated with homotypic adhesion after
rituximab binding.30 an important observation is that,
within a treated cell population, not all cells uniformly
undergo apoptosis. thus, the induction of apoptosis is
a feature of rituximab, but the responsible mechanism
and its relevance in vivo remain to be investigated.

rituximab and cdc
numerous studies have demonstrated that the fc
portion of rituximab can bind c1q13;39 and simple cdc
assays demonstrate that complement activation induces cell kill.31,32,40 rituximab binding and the subsequent lipid raft formation leads to clustering of the
moabs, probably enhancing capture of c1q, the starting component of the cdc reaction. when the cd20
expression level is the only variable parameter, there is
a direct correlation between the number of cd20 molecules per cell and in vitro cdc activity.10,41 the cd20
expression level has been suggested to be a predictor
of clinical cdc efficiency; however, several studies
show contradictory results and there is no clear evidence for this relationship.31,42– 44 at least in vitro, there
is a clear correlation between the expression of complement regulatory proteins (crps) and rituximab-induced cdc activity.31 however, there are also contradictory results with respect to crp expression and
clinical efficacy.31,40,44 – 46
the importance of complement in rituximab-induced tumor clearance has been demonstrated in animal models.9,47,48 in these studies it was shown that
complement was an essential substrate for rituximab to
induce cell kill.9,47,48 in addition to these animal studies,
it was demonstrated in patients that administration of
rituximab results in complement consumption. infusion-related side effects of rituximab may be caused by
acute complement consumption of circulating lym-

202

phoma cells in the peripheral blood49,50 and restoring
the complement stock by the addition of fresh frozen
plasma might be beneficial, for example, in the treatment of cll patients.51
on the other hand, complement components may
play a negative role in rituximab therapy. in cll patients it has been demonstrated that c3b may form a
complex with rituximab and could be a target for
fcr-expressing macrophages, leading to shaving off of
the cd20 complex.52–54 c3b might also block the interaction of rituximab and natural killer (nk) cells.55
interestingly, low levels of c1q, due to a specific polymorphism, correlated with enhanced rituximab responses in follicular lymphoma,56 suggesting a role for
complement in rituximab resistance.
therefore, although there is clear evidence that rituximab acts through the complement system in vitro
and in vivo, its exact role in the patient is still under
debate.

rituximab and adcc
adcc is mediated by effector cells expressing fc␥ri
( xxxg770xxx ), fc␥rii (cd32), or fc␥riii (cd16). in vitro it
can be nicely demonstrated that effector cells, such as
nk cells, granulocytes, or macrophages, are able to
recognize the fc portion of rituximab, and kill the
ligated cells by phagocytosis, by the release of cytotoxic granules, or by the indirect effect of cross-linking,
which provides apoptosis.31,36,40,41,45,57,58 on the other
hand, it is difficult to determine the clinical efficacy of
rituximab with the help of in vitro assays. the degree
of adcc depends on the effector:target cell ratio; increasing the amount of effector cells leads to improved
cell kill.31,40,41 in general, an overload of effector cells
(eg, effector:target cell ratio of 100:1) does not lead to
100% cell kill.31,40,41 which mechanism is responsible
for protection is not known, but the cd20 expression
level seems unimportant for adcc.41 in addition, effector cells can be stimulated with cytokines24,58,59 and
specific polymorphisms of the fc␥r on effector cells
determine the efficacy of rituximab.60 – 62
mouse models using fc␥r-deficient mice indicated
that clearing of cd20-expressing cells was fc␥r-dependent for a panel of murine anti-cd20 moabs63 and
rituximab.64 it is not clear which effector cell is the
most important in eliminating tumor cells. nk cells
play a dominant role in vitro,58 but studies in mice with
anti-mouse cd20 moabs against mouse lymphoma
cells demonstrated that depleting macrophages resulted in lymphoma outgrowth. removing neutrophils
and nk cells did not have any effect on tumor clearance.63,65 in addition, macrophages are responsible for
the loss of cd20 expression in cll patients.49,52
the role of effector cells seems to be important and
depends on the balance of inhibitory and activating

t. van meerten and a. hagenbeek
signals on the fc␥r in a specific microenvironment of
the tumor.

rituximab resistance
the mechanism of rituximab resistance is as complex as the mechanism of action of this drug. resistance of lymphoma b cells towards rituximab is observed in about half of the patients in the course of
prolonged treatment. resistance may be lymphomarelated or host-related. lymphoma-related resistance
could be caused by a lower number of cd20 molecules
per cell, or by increased expression of crps or antiapoptotic genes. host-related resistance could be determined by polymorphisms in the fc␥riiia gene effector cells.60,66,67 the cellular microenvironment is
probably the dominant effector and resistance mechanism of rituximab.68 the extent of b-cell depletion
differs in peripheral blood, lymph nodes, and spleen.
also, within the lymph node there is a differential
susceptibility of different b-cell subsets to moab treatment.68,69 in a human cd20 transgenic mouse model,
gong and colleagues demonstrated that circulating b
cells are depleted mainly through the macrophages of
the reticuloendothelial system, while b cells within the
marginal zone compartment in lymph nodes depend
on cdc rather than fc␥r-mediated depletion. in fact, b
cells that are trafficking from the marginal zone to the
vasculature make them susceptible to depletion with
moabs. b cells residing in the lymphoid tissues depend
on the vasculature for accessibility of effector cells.68 in
addition, in some lymph node compartments (germinal
centers) b cells receive additional survival signals. exposure to these signals makes these cells less sensitive
to anti-cd20.68,69 the significance of the microenvironment in rituximab-induced cell death is also indirectly
indicated by differential responses to rituximab therapy
in different subtypes of cd20⫹ lymphomas (which
have unique microenvironments), and is furthermore
supported by the observation that molecular remissions in the blood and bone marrow induced by rituximab can occur in the setting of progressive nodal
disease. more knowledge on and/or manipulation of
the microenvironment may lead to the development of
means to decrease or overcome rituximab resistance.
several attempts have been made to improve rituximab efficacy and thereby overcome resistance. for
example, downregulation of the anti-apoptotic bcl-2
gene by anti-sense oligonucleotides may enhance the
apoptotic effect of rituximab.70 other attempts have
been made to improve adcc by immunostimulatory
molecules like interleukin (il)-2, il-12, il-15, or cpg
sequences,58,59,71,72 or to improve cdc by downregulation of crps, but with limited success.40,42,43

moabs. in recent years, different murine, humanized,

and completely human anti-cd20 moabs have been
developed (for nomenclature, see table 1). these antibodies bind different epitopes and may be stronger in
inducing a specific mechanism of action. rituximab
can be considered the representative of the first-generation therapeutic anti-cd20 moabs. the new antibodies are classified as second or third generation. secondgeneration moabs have a humanized or a completely
human igg1 tail.
although human anti-chimeric antibodies (hacas)
against rituximab are rarely found in patients with
hematologic malignancies, humanizing anti-cd20 antibodies may prevent therapy resistance in those patients
who do develop them.
third-generation anti-cd20 moabs also have, in addition to a humanized igg, an adjusted fc region. fc
regions are modified in order to outperform rituximab
in inducing different effector functions. for example,
fucosylation of the fc region may have a higher affinity
for the fc␥riib on rituximab.
the tenovus laboratory in southampton, uk has
found another way to classify moabs, namely, the ability to translocate cd20 into the lipid rafts. anti-cd20
antibodies are either type i or type ii9,30,32,73,74 (see also
table 2). type i antibodies relocate cd20 molecules
into lipid microdomains. within these microdomains
the clustered immunoglobulins of the moabs are able
to bind c1q and thus are potent cdc inducers. rituximab belongs to the type i antibodies. type ii antibodies do not redistribute cd20 into lipid microdomains
and do not induce cdc. however, type ii antibodies
promote strong homotypic adhesion and produce a
strong induction of direct cell death with the involvement of mitochondria or caspases.30 the murine  xxxd3132xxx  moab  xxxd3405xxx  is the most illustrious example of a type ii antibody.
 xxxd3405xxx  (b1) is a murine igg2a lambda moab.
in patients, ionizing radiation therapy with covalently
linked iodine-131 to  xxxd3405xxx  is successfully used
for the treatment of patients with follicular and transformed nhl who failed or relapsed from prior rituximab treatment and standard chemotherapy.75 without

203

the conjugation of an ionizing agent,  xxxd3405xxx  also
has a direct toxic effect. in vitro data show that  xxxd3405xxx  is far more efficient than rituximab in inducing
apoptosis, and murine models show that it can prolong
the survival of mice injected with daudi lymphoma
cells, in the absence of complement.9 in addition, preclinical studies demonstrate that  xxxd3405xxx  is more
efficient than rituximab in depleting b cells.73 in patients, the direct effect of  xxxd3405xxx  alone is not
clear. it is administered often as a pre-dose before the
isotope-labeled  xxxd3405xxx . this pre-dose was shown
to exert a tumor-reducing effect but conversely slowed
down the effect of  xxxd3405xxx  linked with iodine131.75 these results suggest the need for humanized
b1-like antibodies for cdc-independent treatment of
b-cell malignancies.

binding site of rituximab, which binds the larger 44mer loop. this is probably the most important reason
why  xxxd2771xxx  is more potent than rituximab in
inducing complement.10,76 in addition to the superior
complement activation,  xxxd2771xxx  also triggers a
stronger nk cell–mediated adcc for both the homozygous fc␥riiia 158v and fc␥riiia 158f allotypes.77 first
clinical data with  xxxd2771xxx  showed safe application
and promising responses to therapy in rituximab-resistant patients.78,79 in a phase i/ii trial of patients with
follicular lymphoma, previously treated with rituximab, clinical responses with  xxxd2771xxx  were up to
63% with a median time to progression of 32.8
months.79 in 116 rituximab-refractory follicular lymphoma patients, administration of  xxxd2771xxx  as a
single agent resulted in a 10% overall response rate
(orr) with a mean duration of response of 6 months.
the orr in patients refractory to rituximab monotherapy was 22%.80 interim results for  xxxd2771xxx  in
heavily pretreated patients with  xxxd2120xxx -refractory
and alemtuzumab-refractory cll showed that monotherapy resulted in an orr of 58% with a duration of
response of 7.1 months and improvement of disease
symptoms, and a good safety profile,81 results that
were independent of prior rituximab pretreatment.82
first results in patients with previously untreated
cll demonstrate that  xxxd2771xxx  in combination
with chemotherapy ( xxxd2120xxx  and cyclophosphamide) is highly active. in the 1,000 mg  xxxd2771xxx 
group, a 50% complete response (cr) rate was obtained with an orr of 73%. no serious adverse

events were reported during a follow-up of 30 days.83
 xxxd2771xxx  is currently being explored in a number of phase ii/iii studies.

veltuzumab (ha20, immu-106)
veltuzumab is a type i, humanized igg1 moab generated using the same human framework as  xxxd2015xxx  (humanized anti- xxxg378xxx ). the complementarydetermining regions (cdrs) were taken from the
parental murine a20. compared to rituximab, there is
a single amino acid difference in cdr3-vh. for this
reason, veltuzumab has a slower off rate and improved
in vivo activity.84 in vitro, the three main mechanisms
of action are similar to rituximab.85 the first clinical
studies have shown favorable safety and efficacy results
in nhl patients with lower doses and fewer administrations of antibody.86 – 88
in a multicenter phase i/ii trial that included 55
pretreated patients with follicular lymphoma, the objective orr was 44% with a cr rate of 27%.89 a phase
i/ii study examined subcutaneous (sc) administration
of veltuzumab in nhl and cll. subcutaneous injection
of veltuzumab resulted in a slow release pattern over
several days with a fast depletion of circulating b cells
and an objective response rate of 53% (cr rate of 20%).
in the same study, sc injection of veltuzumab in patients with cll resulted in lower serum levels compared to the nhl group. this is probably due to the
high level of circulating cll cells. in concordance with
the low serum level, no objective orr was obtained,

next generation of anti-cd20 monoclonal antibodies

but 71% of the patients achieved stable disease. more
frequent or higher dosing is needed to achieve objective responses.90

ocrelizumab (pro70769 or rhuh27)
ocrelizumab is derived from the murine 2h7  xxxd3132xxx  antibody and humanized with recombination
techniques. ocrelizumab is a type i moab and has an
igg1 isotype. compared to rituximab, ocrelizumab
binds a different but overlapping epitope on the large
extracellular part of cd20 and shows a two- to fivefold increased adcc and three- to fivefold decreased
cdc.91
it was also shown that treatment with ocrelizumab
resulted in less infusion-related reaction.91 this is probably due to the decreased cdc activity, since the intravascular complement activation by igg is held responsible for these reactions.49,50
in a phase i/ii study, ocrelizumab was administered
to rituximab-pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory follicular nhl. ocrelizumab was well tolerated
and showed a response rate of 36%.91
in cynomolgus monkeys ocrelizumab was shown to
have the same b-cell– depleting capability as rituximab.69 the action group studied ocrelizumab in
combination with methotrexate in a phase i/ii trial in
the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. over a 72-week
follow-up period, ocrelizumab appeared to be safe with
minimal immunogenicity and longer duration of the
b-cell depletion.92

third-generation antibodies
pro131921
modification of ocrelizumab resulted in an antibody
with improved binding to fc␥riiia and possibly a
better adcc. this version of ocrelizumab, called
pro131921, has been studied in a phase i/ii trial in the
treatment of relapsed or refractory indolent nhl.93 first
results in rituximab-pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory nhl show clinical efficacy (27% partial response
[pr] rate in 22 evaluated patients with relapsed or refractory cd20⫹ lymphoma) and pro131921 was well tolerated.94

the production of this antibody is based on the fact
that there is a strong correlation between fc␥riii
(cd16) polymorphisms and moab efficacy.95,96 ame133 is a type i, humanized igg1 moab. it consists of a
human germline framework region into which cdrs
are inserted. using a mutagenetic procedure, cdrs
were synthesized by targeted insertion of synthetic
oligonucleotide pools; their selection is based on enhanced moab affinity for cd20. in addition, the fc
region was also modified by targeting the constant

205

region with synthetic oligonucleotides. this resulted in
an antibody with enhanced affinity for human fc␥riii
and an enhanced adcc activity in comparison to rituximab. the clinical efficacy of ame-133 is currently
being studied in a phase i/ii trial for the treatment of
nhl. no clinical data are available yet.

tru-015
tru-015 is not an antibody but a small modular
immunopharmaceutical of 104 kd. it is composed of a
single-chain fv specific for cd20 that is linked to human igg1 ch2 and ch3 domains. in vitro and in vivo it
is effective against different b-cell lines by inducing
direct cell death and the activation of effector cells.
complement activation is reduced compared to rituximab. in addition, a single-dose injection of tru-015 to
non-human primates shows a dose-dependent and durable depletion of peripheral blood b cells.97 in a small
phase i study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis,
tru-015 was shown to be safe and well-tolerated.98

 xxxd2765xxx  (ro5072759)
 xxxd2765xxx  is a humanized type ii anti-cd20 moab. it is
generated by grafting cdr sequences of the b- xxxd1255xxx   xxxd3132xxx  moab on framework regions of fully human
igg1-kappa germline sequences. different elbow hinge
sequences in the variable region were optimized for
the best possible induction of apoptosis. in addition,
the fc region has been glycol-engineered, resulting in a
50-fold higher affinity to human fc␥riii receptors.99
in vitro,  xxxd2765xxx  was shown to have a stronger antiproliferative effect than rituximab in different mantle
cell lymphoma lines.100 the antiproliferative effect of
 xxxd2765xxx  occurs in a non-apoptotic manner. direct cell
death is evoked by homotypic adhesion and actin-dependent lysosome-mediated cell death.101 this strong
direct effect of  xxxd2765xxx  may be due to different binding
properties of  xxxd2765xxx  on cd20 compared to rituximab.102  xxxd2765xxx  binds in a different orientation and on
a larger surface area of cd20, which may result in
differences in cellular downstream signals.102
in vitro,  xxxd2765xxx  is superior to rituximab with regard
to b-cell depletion in samples from healthy donors and
from patients with b-cll in the presence of autologous
peripheral blood cells.103–105 interestingly, as c3b might
block nk cell–mediated cell death by rituximab, this is
not the case for  xxxd2765xxx  resulting in enhanced adcc.106
in cynomolgus monkeys,  xxxd2765xxx  was shown to be
superior to rituximab as regards efficacy for b-cell depletion in the tissues.107 results of the first phase i
dose-escalating trial in patients with difficult-to-treat
nhl are promising. twenty-five patients with the distinct nhl subtypes received nine infusions of  xxxd2765xxx 
starting at 50 mg per dose to 2,000 mg per dose. of
these patients, 95% were pretreated with rituximab
and 48% had a previous stem cell transplantation.

figure 3. development of monoclonal antibodies recognizing cd20. murine anti-cd20 moabs are generated by immunization of mice with cd20⫹ cells. in chimeric antibodies, the 30% that is of murine origin is the variable region that recognizes
the  xxxg1445xxx . the variable regions are cloned into a chimeric antibody expression vector, resulting in an antibody which
contains the constant ␬ region and the igg1-fc region of human origin. for humanized antibodies, also with cloning
techniques, the variable region is modified to be more human. humanized antibodies contain complementary-determining
regions of murine origin, which recognize the  xxxg1445xxx . only 10% of the antibody is of murine origin. human anti-cd20
moabs are derived from human immunoglobulin transgenic mice. the latter antibodies are likely to be non-immunogenic in
humans.

administration of  xxxd2765xxx  was well tolerated and the
orr was 43%, with five crs and four prs.108,109 in a
comparable phase i trial, in 22 heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory nhl, the orr was 25%
with a safety profile comparable to that of rituximab.110
in patients with relapsed/refractory b-cll, similar results were obtained with a 62% response rate and
favorable safety profile.111,112 ongoing phase ii clinical
studies, including a head-to-head comparison with rituximab, will determine the efficacy of  xxxd2765xxx  and its
unique capacity to enhance adcc and apoptosis of b
cells.

re-engineered rituximab
in addition to the development of new anti-cd20
antibodies, attempts are being made to improve the
mechanism of action of rituximab by redesigning its
properties. for example, genetically engineered tetravalent antibodies were constructed from rituximab
and  xxxd2771xxx . these tetravalent antibodies were more potent in inducing an antiproliferative effect compared to
their normal counterparts. the  xxxd2771xxx  tetravalent antibody was demonstrated to be effective also in vivo by
prolonged survival of mice bearing daudi or raji tumors.113
the same group of investigators redesigned the
binding property of rituximab by introducing three
point mutations in the cdr. an unexpected finding
associated with the change in binding avidity was a
greatly improved apoptosis. this triple mutant of rituximab was also shown to have potent in vivo therapeutic efficacy.114

conclusion
although cd20-targeted therapy with rituximab has
greatly enhanced the outcome of patients with b-cell
malignancies, resistance to rituximab is still a major
problem, resulting in non-response and early relapse of
disease. second- and third-generation anti-cd20 moabs

have been developed to overcome resistance to rituximab.
moabs such as  xxxd2771xxx  may have a promising
role in treatment of cll patients. in general, cd20
expression level is low on cll samples and  xxxd2771xxx  needs fewer cd20 molecules per cell to evoke
potent complement activation.10 moreover, complement-mediated cell lysis probably plays an important
role in cll patients because addition of fresh frozen
plasma to rituximab was shown to increase the response.51,115
the first clinical trials showed that type ii antibodies
( xxxd2765xxx ) may also be superior to rituximab. these antibodies might be more effective than rituximab in all
kinds of cd20⫹ malignancies since they exhibit a very
strong antiproliferative effect. however, this should be
proven by prospective clinical studies in rituximabrefractory patients, or through a head-to-head comparison, which is in progress.
to assess the additional value of new antibodies,
two criteria are used: a superior efficacy if compared
head-to-head with rituximab, or a significant response
in rituximab-refractory nhl patients. resistance is determined by a complex combination of the three mechanisms of action of rituximab (cdc, adcc, and apoptosis) and a patient-specific microenvironment of the
lymphoma. b-cell depletion studies in monkeys and
mice have also demonstrated that distinct subtypes of b
cells in the lymph nodes exert different mechanisms of
cell-specific resistance.68,69 therefore, each combination of patient and lymphoma subtype may have a
unique mechanism of resistance. a better understanding of all these factors contributing to rituximab resistance may eventually lead to individual patient-based
anti-cd20 therapy. (figure 3).
