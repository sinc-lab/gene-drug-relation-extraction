abstract
effects of the prooxidant ␦- xxxd148xxx  (ala) and the antioxidant melatonin (mel) were investigated in the male
syrian hamster harderian gland (hg). rodent harderian glands are highly porphyrogenic organs, which may be used as model
systems for studying damage by ␦- xxxd148xxx  and its metabolites, as occurring in porphyrias. chronic administration
of ␦- xxxd148xxx  (2 weeks) markedly decreased activities of the porphyrogenic enzymes ␦- xxxd148xxx  synthase (ala-s) and ␦- xxxg121xxx  (ala-d) and of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (sod),
 xxxg981xxx  (gr) and catalase (cat), whereas porphobilinogen deaminase (pbg-d) remained unaffected. this
treatment led to increased lipid peroxidation (lpo) and oxidatively modified protein (protein carbonyl) as well as to morphologically apparent tissue damage. melatonin also caused decreases in ␦- xxxd148xxx  synthase, ␦- xxxd148xxx 
dehydratase, superoxide dismutase,  xxxg981xxx  and catalase. despite lower activities of antioxidant enzymes, lipid
peroxidation and protein carbonyl were markedly diminished. the combination of ␦- xxxd148xxx  and melatonin led
to approximately normal levels of ␦- xxxg121xxx ,  xxxg981xxx , catalase and protein carbonyl, and
to rises in superoxide dismutase and porphobilinogen deaminase activities; lipid peroxidation remained even lower than in
controls and the appearance of the tissue revealed a protective influence of melatonin. these results suggest that melatonin
may have profound effects on the oxidant status of the harderian gland. © 2002 elsevier science ltd. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
harderian glands (hgs) are large orbital lachrymal glands present in most terrestrial vertebrates. in
the syrian hamster, hgs show a strong dimorphism,
which is under androgenic control [1,2]. hgs from
female hamsters possess a single secretory cell type

(type i cell), which is characterized by minute lipid
droplets, whereas the hgs from male hamsters show
two secretory cell types, type i (similar to but not
identical with the female type) and type ii cells, which
are filled with large lipid vacuoles and have a swollen
appearance [1]. moreover, there are distinct ultrastructural differences in the hgs of both sexes [3]. hgs
from rodents are of special interest since they accumulate large quantities of protoporphyrins, elsewhere intermediary metabolites in heme biosynthesis. in most
tissues,  xxxd3037xxx  is converted to heme by

 xxxg781xxx . however, in the hg, the activity of this
enzyme is very low [4] so that the uncomplexed porphyrins can rise to unusually high amounts [5,6].
␦- xxxd148xxx  (ala), the first metabolite
of the heme biosynthetic pathway, is a potent prooxidant molecule, which may cross the blood-brain
barrier [7,8]. moreover, oxidative stress can result
from protoporphyrins. the hg is, by its orbital location, accessible to light. porphyrin accumulation
has been reported to cause mitochondrial damage
and cell death in the hgs of female and male syrian
hamsters [9,10]. porphyrins exposed to light produce
superoxide anions, protoporphyrinyl cation radicals
[11,12] and other reactive oxygen species (ros) such
as singlet oxygen [13–15].
the  xxxd2559xxx , melatonin (mel, n-acetyl-5methoxytryptamine) has been found to be a highly effective antioxidant and free radical scavenger [16,17].
because of its free radical scavenging properties and
its capability of inducing antioxidant enzymes [18,19],
melatonin has been assumed to be an endogenous protective agent against oxidative damage.
medeiros et al. [20] reported high levels of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (sod) and
glutathione peroxidase in erythrocytes of patients with
acute intermittent porphyria (aip). aip is a genetically
inherited disorder of the heme biosynthetic pathway,
characterized by a partial block in liver porphobilinogen deaminase (pbg-d) leading to accumulation and
increased urinary excretion of the precursors ala and
porphobilinogen (pbg). more recently, bechara and
co-workers [21,22] reported the involvement of ros
promoted by autooxidation of ala in the pathophysiology of aip. in an iron-catalyzed oxidation, enolic
ala leads to the formation of the superoxide radical
(o2 •− ),  xxxd2298xxx  (h2 o2 ) and the hydroxyl
radical (oh• ) [23,24].
these findings along with recent investigations by
our group on antioxidant and porphyric enzymes in
the hg prompted us to investigate the effects of ala
and melatonin administrations on porphyrin biosynthesis and on oxidative damage of proteins and lipids
in the syrian hamster hg [25]. for this purpose, we
chose the male gland, since ala, protoporphyrin as
well as melatonin concentrations are lower than in the
female organ [1,4] and since endogenous oxidative
damage caused by porphyric metabolites is already
considerably higher in females [9,10]. therefore,

545

administrations of ala were expected to be still tolerable in males and to cause more profound, but still
sublethal effects.
2. materials and methods
2.1. animals
thirty-five male syrian hamsters (mesocricetus auratus) were divided five per cage and acclimated for 5
weeks to a temperature of 22 ± 2 ◦ c and a light/dark
cycle of 14:10 h. food and water were provided ad
libitum. animals were sacrificed at zt 6:00 (“zeitgeber time” 0 h = zt0 = onset of light), a circadian
phase previously identified as the maximum of catalase (cat) activity [25]. ten animals were sacrificed
for determinations of antioxidant enzymes, 20 for porphyric enzyme assays and five for morphological and
morphometric studies.
2.2. injections
animals were injected intraperitoneally at zt 5:00
(daily, 2 weeks), with ala (40 mg/kg body weight)
and/or melatonin at zt 10:00 (500 ␮g/kg body
weight), administered in saline. melatonin had been
predissolved in ethanol (final ethanol concentration,
0.5%). controls received the same volume of saline
under the same conditions.
2.3. morphological studies
hamsters were decapitated and tissue was dissected, cut into small pieces and immersed in a fixative
mixture containing 1.25% paraformaldehyde–2.5%
glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (ph 7.3).
fixation was extended for 24 h at room temperature.
after extensive washing in phosphate buffer, tissues
were postfixed in 1% oso4 for 2 h. after dehydration
in acetone, tissues were embedded in epoxy resins.
semi-thin sections (1 ␮m) were cut using an lkb
ultratome, stained with toluidine blue, studied and
photographed in a leitz orthoplan microscope.
2.4. enzyme assays
after decapitation, harderian glands were quickly
removed, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and

546

stored at −70 ◦ c. after thawing, tissue was homogenized in 50 mm phosphate buffer, ph 7.5 (1:10,
w/v), using a potter-elvehjem glass homogenizer
with motor-driven teflon pestle. in the case of
␦- xxxd148xxx  synthase (ala-s, ec 2.3.1.37),
homogenization was carried out in ice-cold 10 mm
tris–hcl buffer, ph 7.4, containing 0.5 mm edta
and 0.9% nacl. after centrifuging the respective homogenates for 10 min at 3000 × g, supernatants were
used for assays according to the following procedures:
cat ( xxxg345xxx ) activity was measured according
to lubinsky and bewley [26]; the incubation mixture contained h2 o2 as substrate and homogenated
tissue. h2 o2 destruction was followed during 4 min
at 230 nm. sod (ec 1.15.1.1) was assayed by the
method of martin et al. [27]; the reaction mixture contained hematoxyline as substrate and homogenated
tissue; hematoxyline oxidation was followed during
10 min at 560 nm.  xxxg981xxx  (gr, ec
1.6.4.2) was determined by the procedure of kum-tatt
et al. [28]; incubation mixture:  xxxd2811xxx 
and nadph + h+ as substrates and homogenated
tissue; oxidation of nadph + h+ was followed
during 5 min at 340 nm. ala-s (ec 2.3.1.37) activity was measured according to volknandt and
hardeland [29]; the incubation mixture contained
glycine and succinate as substrates and homogenated
tissue. formed product, ala, was measured at
555 nm. ␦- xxxg121xxx  (ala-d,
 xxxg121xxx ) activity was determined by measuring
pbg formed, as described by mauzerall and granick
[30]; the incubation mixture: ala as substrate and
homogenated tissue; formed pbg was measured at
555 nm. pbg-d ( xxxg1016xxx .8) was assayed according
to rimington [31]; the incubation mixture contained
pbg as substrate and homogenated tissue; formed
product was measured at 405 nm. porphyric assays
incubations were carried out aerobically, in the dark
at 37 ◦ c. protein concentration was determined as
described by lowry et al. [32].
2.5. lipid and protein damage
lipid peroxidation (lpo) was measured by determining malondialdehyde (mda) and 4-hydroxyalkenal
(4hda). each sample was homogenized (potterelvehjem) in a 10-fold volume of ice-cold 20 mm
tris–hcl buffer, ph 7.4. heavy particles were

removed from the homogenate by centrifuging for
10 min at 3000 × g. amounts of mda and 4hda
were determined in the supernatants using a lipid peroxidation assay kit from calbiochem (no. 437634)
based on the condensation reaction of the chromogene
1-methyl-2-phenylindole with either mda or 4hda.
the stable chromophores were determined at 586 nm.
results are expressed as nmol mda + 4hda/mg protein [31]. protein carbonyl (‘protein damage’ = pd)
was determined by a modification [33,34] of the
method by levine et al. [35].
2.6. statistical analysis
data are presented as mean values ± s.e.m.
calculated from at least three separate experiments,
each performed in triplicate. statistical comparisons between controls and ala- or melatonin-injected hamsters were evaluated by means of the
student’s test. the level of significance accepted was
p ≤ 0.05.

3. results
3.1. in vivo effects of melatonin on porphyric
enzymes under the influence of ala
hamsters injected i.p. with ala for 2 weeks (ala
group) showed dramatically decreased ala-s activities (9.36%; p ≤ 0.015; fig. 1). the treatment of
ala plus mel also resulted in values significantly
lower than those of controls (ala + mel: 21.34%;
p ≤ 0.027; fig. 1). average activities measured after injections of mel were also lower, but this effect was statistically not significant (mel: 32.2%;
fig. 1).
ala treatment caused a significant decline in
ala-d activity (45.37% of control; p ≤ 0.001;
fig. 1). similar, significantly decreased, values
were obtained with mel (36.57%; p ≤ 0.001
versus control; p ≤ 0.044 versus ala group).
however, the combination of the two substances
resulted in activities slightly above the controls
(119.58%; p ≤ 0.013).
pbg-d activity remained unaffected by both
ala and mel (fig. 1); nevertheless, the combi-

(338.7%).
3.2. in vivo effects of melatonin on antioxidant
enzymes under the influence of ala
three enzymes of the antioxidative protection system were investigated after chronic administration of
ala and/or mel, sod, gr and cat (fig. 2). in the
ala group, sod levels were significantly decreased

(56.12%; p ≤ 0.001). even stronger diminutions
were obtained with mel alone (23.31%; p ≤ 0.001
versus control; p ≤ 0.001 versus ala group). however, when ala and mel were combined, sod
levels were not only restored, but even exceeded those
of controls (159.27%; p ≤ 0.001).
both ala and mel significantly decreased gr
activity (for ala 11.54%; for mel 31.34%; p ≤
0.001), ala exerting here an even stronger effect than
in the former enzyme. the combination of ala and
mel led to mean gr levels slightly above those of
controls (133.11%).
in the case of cat activity, a marked drop was
particularly apparent after ala administration, but
decreases were also demonstrable in the other groups

(22.14% for ala; 74.1% for ala + mel and
40.94% for mel; p ≤ 0.001). however, the combination of ala and mel gave the highest values
among the treated groups, so that a tendency towards
restoration was present.
3.3. in vivo effect of melatonin on lipid
peroxidation caused by ala treatment
effects of ala and mel on lpo are presented in
fig. 3. chronic ala administration led to a moderate, but statistically significant increase (121.5%; p ≤
0.005). mel, when given together with ala, reverted
this rise and even decreased mda + 4hda levels to
below those of controls (53.83%; p ≤ 0.001). mel
alone further reduced concentrations of mda+4hda
(39.74%; p ≤ 0.001 versus control, ala and ala +
mel groups).
3.4. in vivo effect of melatonin on protein damage
caused by ala treatment
the effects on protein damage (pd), as demonstrated in fig. 4, were essentially similar to those
on lipid peroxidation. ala administration strongly
increased protein carbonyl levels (203.46%; p ≤
0.001). ala, combined with mel administration,
largely prevented the rise in pd; values were similar
to those of controls (125.33%). mel alone significantly decreased pd below control levels (70.22%;
p ≤ 0.001).

3.5. morphological observations
the harderian gland of hamsters is widely composed of tubulo-alveolar units that, in sections, appear
as round, oval or roughly polygonal profiles smooth
in outline, separated by connective strands containing blood vessels and nerve fibers. in every group,
it was possible to find some damaged structures in
the hg, including the untreated animals. however,
there were qualitative and quantitative differences in
the degree of structural damage. in the ala group,
alveolar cells were frequently observed which were
protruding at the basal pole towards the connective
tissue. some tubules in the gland are filled with a
mass of cellular debris with staining properties resembling those of the clear cells (fig. 5a,b). sporadically, intravascular masses were observed, indicating that some cellular debris was transported in the
blood stream (fig. 5b). these structures were never
observed in other groups. in the control group, we only
found in some tubulo-alveoli several cells that were
lightly stained, displaying a weak basophilia; therefore, their appearance is paler than that of the other
cells. these cells were present in all groups studied. in
none of the groups, accumulation of porphyrins was
found in the acinar lumen, contrary to the situation in
females.
in the ala + mel group, masses of cellular debris
apparently coming from type ii cells almost totally
filled the acinar lumen and connective tissue. however,

intravascular masses were never observed and even if
some clear cells were present, the general appearance
of the glands was more healthy than in the ala group
(fig. 6). in the mel group, integrity was even better
preserved than in controls.

in general, the tissue injuries described were
found—in a mosaic-like fashion—in delimited areas
of the glands and not necessarily seen in every section
of the samples. with increasing state of damage, the
areas affected were correspondingly more extended.

4. discussion
a remarkable feature of the harderian gland is
its high porphyrogenic activity. even in male syrian hamsters, this activity is higher than in the
liver. however, the hg is, in principle, capable of
producing—and surviving—even higher concentrations of porphyrins and their precursors, as is evident
in females and in castrated males [1,2]. this property
makes the hg interesting with regard to pathological aspects of accumulations of porphyric precursors
such as ala, pbg and porphyrins as well. aip is an
autosomal dominant disease characterized primarily
by a 50% reduction in the activity of pbg-d and a
secondary increase of ␦- xxxd148xxx  synthase, the
rate-limiting enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway. acute attacks associated with aip are accompanied by abdominal symptoms, neuropsychiatric disorders, and biochemical changes such as production
of large amounts of the precursors ala and pbg.
based on current evidence, cell toxicity and, more
in particular, neurotoxicity is mainly attributed to the
excess of ala [36–38]. in view of these findings, the
hg is a well-suitable model for studying the effects
of ros on cells, including damage to biomolecules
and morphological structures as well as changes in
antioxidant enzymes and in the porphyric pathway.
from a morphological point of view, the presence
of cellular debris in the lumina of the tubulo-alveoli
and in connective tissue is known from previous investigations [39]. for the female syrian hamster hg,
antolı́n et al. [9] have reported the existence of a
particular cell type (clear cells) which shows structural and ultrastructural features of damage. these
changes indicate a process of cell degeneration related to the accumulation of porphyrins, which are
secreted into the lumina of the tubules. our results
demonstrate the existence of such clear cells in hgs
of male syrian hamsters too, and their contribution
to the intratubular material. morphological differences
between groups became apparent, demonstrating oxidative damage caused by ala and protection by
mel. although biochemical changes were more profound than morphological ones, distinct morphological differences were present after the exposure to ala
and/or mel.
oxidative stress by ala and its counteraction by
mel became also evident in the measurements of

lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl. ala caused
stronger damage to the biomolecules, whereas mel
diminished it to levels lower than in controls. these
findings deserve a detailed analysis, since pro- and
antioxidant effects are superimposed by regulatory effects on gene expression.
the decrease in ala-s activity should be mainly
interpreted in terms of feedback repression of this first,
rate-limiting enzyme in the porphyrogenic pathway.
however, destruction of the enzyme’s active center by
ala-generated ros may contribute to the low activities measured. the effect of mel alone on ala-s is in
accordance with previous findings demonstrating that
daily injections of melatonin diminish the hg intraluminal area occupied by porphyrins [40]. therefore,
the decrease of ala-s in response to mel should be
mainly seen under the aspect of an antiporphyrogenic
effect of the hormone.
ala-d activity was also decreased by ala alone,
but to a smaller extent. this effect may be physiologically less relevant with regard to the much higher level
of this enzyme which did not become rate-limiting
in any of the experimental conditions of this study.
mel alone also caused a drop in ala-d, an effect
being in accordance with the suppression of porphyrogensis. pbg-d was not affected by either of these
treatments.
surprisingly, the combination of ala and mel
led to a restoration of ala-d activity and a marked
rise in pbg-d. this may be explained on the basis of
prooxidant and antioxidant effects. the active centers
of both ala-d and pbg-d are easily destroyed by
reactive oxygens, as generated by ala. destruction
of ala-d at pharmacological and pbg-d already at
physiological ala levels may be reverted by the free
radical scavenger mel. in the case of pbg-d, activity
even rose to supernormal levels. such a protection of
proteins by mel under ala-initiated oxidative stress
is in agreement with other reports [17,41].
the protective potency of melatonin, as discussed
here for particular, relatively susceptible enzymes, was
also demonstrable for overall protein damage. protein
modification under the influence of ala can, e.g. be
detected as thiol cross-linking [22] and as protein carbonyl. ala doubled protein carbonyl in the hg, an
effect approximately reverted by mel to normality,
while mel alone reduced protein carbonyl to concentrations much below those of controls. the differences

c. tomás-zapico et al. / the international journal of biochemistry & cell biology 34 (2002) 544–553

between ala + mel and mel alone, as well as between controls and mel alone, indicate (a) that oxidative damage is considerable already in control glands,
and (b) that the repression of porphyrin biosynthesis
by melatonin contributes to the decrease in oxidative
stress.
the changes in enzyme activities, protein carbonyl
and lipid peroxidation also requires a view on the
effects of ala and mel on the enzymatic protection
system [42]. we would like to express our conviction that an investigation at the levels of mrna [18]
or even enzyme concentration, e.g. by western blot,
would be insufficient, since one would loose the
finally decisive information on enzyme activity.
in our experiments, we obtained a clear-cut correlation between sod, gr and cat, after any of the
treatments, though the extent of the respective effects
varied somewhat from enzyme to enzyme.
the findings on cat deserve a special consideration insofar as this enzyme had previously not
been detected in the hg [18], until we were able to
demonstrate its presence recently [25]. enzyme activity exhibits a rhythmic pattern with strong ultradian
components. therefore, we designed the experiments
in a way that the enzyme was measured at its temporal
maximum in the hg. moreover, effects of the cellular
redox state should also take into account that cat
contains tightly bound nadph [43], which might be
particularly susceptible to oxidative stress.
mel exerted suppressive effects on all the three
antioxidative enzymes studied, despite the fact that
the indoleamine diminished protein carbonyl and lipid
peroxidation. therefore, one should assume a regulatory decrease of these enzymes in response to reduced
oxidative stress, partly due to a decline in porphyrogenesis, partly to mel’s antioxidant properties. adaptive behavior in relation to oxidative stress has been
repeatedly described for several protective enzymes
in various tissues and cell lines [44–48]; therefore, a
reduction of the oxidative pressure may well lead to
their down-regulation.
the antioxidant effects of mel are usually multiple.
the molecule per se is not able to scavenge superoxide
anions directly, while this can happen after electron
abstraction or under catalysis of melatonin degradation
by complexed iron. more importantly, mel is a very
efficient scavenger of hydroxyl radicals [49]. although
mel may increase levels of sod-mrna in brain

551

cortex [50], no such rise was detected at the level of
enzyme activity in the male hg after chronic administration of mel alone (fig. 2). it may be noted that
mel alone suppressed sod and gr more strongly
than cat. the more favorable sod/cat ratio may
represent an additional beneficial effect of mel,
since  xxxd2298xxx  should be more efficiently
eliminated.
the decrease in gr activity by mel alone may reflect a lower necessity for  xxxd2811xxx  form
( xxxd2811xxx ) restoration under diminished oxidative stress.
this could be relevant also with regard to the fact that
ala was shown to cause protein damage through thiol
cross-linking too [22], an action presumably counteracted by mel via both elimination of ros and
down-regulation of porphyrogenesis.
the decreases in sod, gr and cat activities observed after administration of ala alone should not
be attributed to down-regulation, but rather reflect
destruction by augmentation of ros. therefore, the
interpretation for these declines under the influence of
ala has to be entirely different from that caused by
mel. in other words, two opposite effects, namely,
increase and decrease of oxidative stress can lead to
the same result, diminution in the activities of protective enzymes. this explanation makes sense, since
the increase of oxidative stress by ala is demonstrated at protein carbonyl and lipid peroxidation
levels, as well as corresponding decreases exerted
by mel.
under these premises, the high activities of sod,
gr and cat measured after combined administration
of ala + mel are no longer surprising: mel does
protect enzymes from the ros generated by ala,
but at the same time, mel concentration is decreased
by its interactions with ros, an effect which has already been demonstrated under various conditions of
sublethal oxidative stress in another, unicellular system containing mel in micromolar concentrations
[51,52]. because of its destruction, mel becomes unable to down-regulate endogenous porphyrogenesis, a
conclusion supported by the data on ala-s, ala-d
and pbg-d. ala effects are widely compensated and
enzyme molecules are more efficiently preserved by
mel, but in the presence of almost normal porphyrogenetic rates, the oxidative pressure does not drop
and antioxidant enzyme activities are maintained at an
approximately normal level.
