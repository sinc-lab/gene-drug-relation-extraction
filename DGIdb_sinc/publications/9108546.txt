abstract
pyrimethamine and cycloguanil are competitive inhibitors of the plasmodium enzyme  xxxg631xxx 
(dhfr). they have been effective treatments for malaria, but rapid selection of populations of the parasite resistant
to these drugs has compromised their effectiveness. parasites resistant to either drug usually have point mutations in
the dhfr gene, but the frequency of these mutations is unknown. to study drug resistance more effectively, we
transferred the dhfr domain of the dhfr- xxxg2366xxx  gene from a drug-sensitive line of p. falciparum to a
strain of the budding yeast, saccharomyces cere6isiae, that lacks endogenous dhfr activity. expression of the p.
falciparum dhfr is controlled by the yeast dhfr 5% and 3% regulatory regions and the heterologous enzyme provided all
of the functions of the yeast dhfr gene. these yeast were susceptible to pyrimethamine and cycloguanil at low
concentrations that inhibit p. falciparum (ic50 about 10 − 8 and 10 − 7 m, respectively). yeast expressing constructs
with dhfr alleles from pyrimethamine-resistant strains were resistant to both pyrimethamine and cycloguanil
(ic50 \10 − 6 m); resistance of the yeast depended on the dhfr allele they expressed. the experimental drug wr99210
efficiently killed all three yeast strains (ic50 about 10 − 8 m) but the pyrr strains showed collateral hypersensitivity to
drug. the yeast transformants carrying the drug-sensitive allele can now be screened quickly and quantitatively to
identify new drugs or combinations of drugs and determine which drugs select resistant parasites least efficiently. such
compounds would be excellent candidates for development of treatments with a longer life in clinical practice. © 1997

1. introduction
the selection of populations resistant to standard regimens of chemotherapy has led to a major
public health problem in many regions where
falciparum malaria is common. currently, most
of the drugs that have been used in the past to
treat or prevent malaria are no longer effective
[1,2]. it is critical to increase chemotherapeutic
options by identifying new drugs and drug
targets, and optimizing deployment of drugs that
are already in use. two drugs that have been used
widely against malaria are pyrimethamine and
 xxxd1672xxx  (which is metabolized in humans into
the active form, cycloguanil [1]). these are both
competitive inhibitors of the enzyme  xxxg631xxx  (dhfr;  xxxd3334xxx :
nadp + oxidoreductase, ec 1.5.1.3) that controls a key step in thymidylate biosynthesis [3].
drug screening studies have identified many other
dhfr inhibitors that are effective in vitro
against p. falciparum [4 – 6], but the rapid selection of resistance to pyrimethamine and cycloguanil has strongly discouraged further
development. the assumption is that other drugs
with a mode of action similar to pyrimethamine
and cycloguanil would show equally strong selection for drug resistance, but it has not been
possible to test this directly.
although the gene that encodes dhfr has
been strongly conserved during evolution, subtle
differences in the active sites of bacterial, human
and parasite enzymes have been exploited to develop dhfr inhibitors specific to particular
pathogens [1,3]. for example, pyrimethamine and
cycloguanil bind strongly to the p. falciparum
dhfr active site, but not to that of humans [7].
in eukaryotes, resistance to inhibitors of dhfr
develops in three major ways: changes in drug
transport or accumulation, overexpression of the
wild type enzyme or point mutations in the dhfr
gene that reduce the binding affinity of the inhibitor [3,8]. in mammalian cells, the first two
mechanisms predominate and in the kinetoplastid,
leishmania tropica, resistance results mostly from
over-replication of the region that encodes the
wild type enzyme [9]. resistance due to overexpression of the enzyme has only been reported in

a laboratory line of p. falciparum selected for
pyrimethamine resistance [10]. in all other cases,
resistance to dhfr inhibitors correlated with
point mutations in the dhfr enzyme itself, both
in lines selected in the lab [10,11] and in field
populations [12–14]. based on these studies, there
is considerable agreement that resistance to
pyrimethamine is associated with a mutation in
the ser108 to asn and that a further increase in
resistance results from changes to ile51, arg59 or
leu164
[7,12,15,16].
transfection
into
pyrimethamine-sensitive p. falciparum of a dhfr
gene carrying the asn108 mutation has recently
confirmed the importance of that mutation [17].
similar studies of the dhfr coding region of parasites from cycloguanil resistant populations have
identified positions thr108 and val16 as possible
mutations to cycloguanil resistance, but the correspondence between particular mutations and the
cycloguanil-resistant phenotype (cycr) is considerably less clear for this drug [18,19].
the dhfr enzyme activity in p. falciparum is
one domain of a bifunctional enzyme that includes  xxxg2366xxx  (ts), an enzyme that
catalyzes a subsequent step in the folate pathway,
[3,20]. a construct that contains just the dhfr
domain has been cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, but the endogenous enzyme is still
produced and the p. falciparum enzyme is mostly
sequestered in inclusion bodies [7,21–23]. therefore, while purification of the p. falciparum
dhfr from the e. coli has been extremely useful
for study of the biochemistry of the enzyme, the
system does not allow the selection of drug resistant e. coli. several groups have studied the development of pyrimethamine resistance (pyrr) in
laboratory populations of p. falciparum [10,11],
but the practical limitations of parasite growth in
the lab prevent the determination of the frequency
with which the resistance develops. peters and his
colleagues have also conducted extensive studies
to select mutants resistant to antifolate drugs
using p. bergei in mice [1], but these studies are
extremely time consuming and expensive.
to circumvent these limitations, we have expressed the p. falciparum dhfr gene in the budding
yeast saccharomyces cere6isiae. this work is the
first step to establish a biological system that will

j.m. wooden et al. / molecular and biochemical parasitology 85 (1997) 25–40

allow new anti-malaria drugs or combinations of
drugs that target the  xxxg631xxx 
enzyme to be screened quickly and quantitatively
to determine their potential as antimalaria
treatments and to measure the frequency with
which colonies resistant to the drug arise.

2. materials and methods

2.1. malaria and yeast strains
three strains of plasmodium falciparum were
used to isolate dna for this study. the strains
sl/d6 [24] and mikenga (kenyan isolate, personal communication) were from dr wilbur milhous (experimental therapeutics division, walter
reed army institute of research, silver spring,
md) and were grown in vitro with a modification
of the method of trager [25]. genomic dna
from the strain honduras 1 [26] was provided by
dr r.f. howard (seattle biomedical research
institute, seattle, wa). the two saccharomyces
cere6isiae strains used, the wild-type parent th1
(mata leu2 -3,112 trp1 ura3 -52 tup1 ) and the dfr1
mutant th5 (mata leu2 -3,112 trp1 ura3 -52
dfr1::ura3 tup1 ), were generously provided by
dr tun huang [27]. yeast were cultured for all
experiments at 30°c, on minimal, dropout, rich
(yepd) and ym-1 using standard yeast genetics
techniques [28]. growth of the dfr1 mutant was
supported by supplementation of the medium
with 100 mg ml − 1  xxxd3365xxx  (sigma, st. louis, mo).

2.2. construction of plasmids
genomic dna for use in polymerase chain
reaction (pcr) was isolated from plasmodium
strains s/l d6 and mikenga using the saponin
lysis-chelex method [29] and from wild-type yeast
(th1) using the glass bead method [30]. primers
that incorporated useful enzyme restriction sites
were designed for each dna to be amplified
based on published sequence data for the p. falciparum [31] and s. cere6isiae dhfr [32] genes. pcr
protocols were all adaptations of standard procedures described in higuchi [33] and saiki et al.
[34]. the reactions contained a total volume of

27

100 ml, with 0.2 mm dntps and 1.25 u of
replitherm (epicentre, madison, wi). the reactions were amplified in a ptc-100 thermocycler
(mj research, watertown, ma) with the following parameters unless noted otherwise: initial denaturation for 4 min at 94°c and 29 cycles with
denaturation at 94°c for 1 min, annealing at 55°c
for 1 min and extension at 72°c for 2 min. the
entire 1.6 kb yeast dhfr gene was amplified as a
kpni/saci product using the upstream primer
5%-gaggtaccctataggaatcgtcactc-3%
and
downstream
primer
5%-ttagagctcaactggatccggacagca-3%, the yeast
dhfr gene promoter as a 600 bp kpni/bamhi
product using the upstream primer 5%-gaggtaccctataggaatcgtcactc-3% and the
downstream primer 5%-agcggatccgctcgtagttcgttgcgctcttca-3%, the yeast dhfr
gene coding region as a 600 bp bamhi/eagi
product using the upstream primer 5%-cgaggatccatggctggaggaaagattcct-3%
and the downstream primer 5%-gcgcggccgaataacctttttcttccagcgagta-3%
and the yeast dhfr terminator/downstream flank
as a 400 bp eagi/saci product using the upstream
primer 5%-taccggccggcttcgaattcactctat-3% and the downstream primer 5%-ttagagctcaactggatccggacagca-3%. the
plasmodium dhfr gene coding region was amplified
(48°c annealing temperature) on a biosycler (bios
corporation) as a 800 bp bamhi/eagi product
using the upstream primer 5%-cgggatcctatgatggaacaagtctgcg-3% and the downstream primer 5%-gcgcggccgtcatatgacatgtatctt-3%.
each pcr product was purified on a wizard
pcr prep dna column (promega, madison,
wi) and digested with the appropriate restriction
enzymes. plasmid preparations, enzyme reactions
and ligation reactions were performed according
to standard methods [35] except for eagi digests
which were done at 30°c overnight. restriction
enzymes, phosphatase and t4 dna ligase were
obtained from boehringer mannheim (indianapolis, in) and new england biolabs (beverley,
ma) and used according to manufacturer’s instructions. vector and insert dna digests were
isolated on a wizard dna column (promega),

fig. 1. test for dhfr enzyme function. (a) test constructs and ability to complement the yeast dfr1 defect. transformants
containing test constructs were transferred onto rich medium and allowed to grow for 2 days. yeast patches were then replica plated
to a test plate without  xxxd3365xxx  and a control plate supplemented with 100 mg ml − 1  xxxd3365xxx . the replica plates were incubated at 30°c
for 3 days before scoring for growth. (b) growth with/without  xxxd3365xxx  supplementation. the wild type, dhfr disruption mutant
(dfr1::ura3 ) and the mutant containing either vector alone, the yeast dhfr construct (sc-dhfr) or the plasmodium dhfr
construct (pf-dhfr) were tested as described above.

ligated, and transformed into e. coli strain dh5a.
taking advantage of the pcr engineered restriction sites, the various components of each dhfr
construct were assembled into the yeast shuttle
vector prs314 [36] in a stepwise fashion to create
the constructs shown in fig. 1. this vector contains selectable markers for bacterial growth in
ampicillin-containing medium and yeast growth in
tryptophan-deficient medium. in addition, it contains yeast sequences that allow autonomous
replication of the plasmid in yeast and centromere
sequences that assure that the yeast cell maintains
the plasmid at about one copy per cell. to

confirm that no mutations were created during the
pcr, dna fragments of interest were cloned into
pks+ -bluescript (stratagene, la jolla, ca) and
subjected to cycle sequencing according to manufacturer’s instructions (perkin-elmer/abi, foster
city, ca)

2.3. complementation tests for dhfr enzyme
function
the constructs were transformed into the yeast
dfr1::ura3 mutant (th5) using the lithium acetate method [37]. transformation mixes were
plated on tryptophan-deficient synthetic medium

j.m. wooden et al. / molecular and biochemical parasitology 85 (1997) 25–40

supplemented with 100 mg ml − 1  xxxd3365xxx  to select
for plasmid-containing cells. after 3 – 5 days of
growth, transformants that grew without tryptophan were replica plated to yepd without
 xxxd3365xxx  to test for dhfr enzyme function. to test
for auxotrophy for the other metabolites that
require activity of the dhfr enzyme (adenine,
histidine, and methionine), transformants for each
construct were transferred to nonselective medium
(yepd + xxxd3365xxx ), allowed to grow for 2 days and
then replica plated to synthetic medium missing
each of the metabolites and to complete synthetic
medium as a control. plates were scored for
growth after 3– 5 days.

2.4. drug sensiti6ity assays
cycloguanil and the experimental antifolate,
wr99210 were generously supplied by dr david
jacobus (jacobus pharmaceutical, princeton, nj),
and chloroquine,  xxxd2258xxx , pyrimethamine
and wr99210 by dr. wilbur milhous. stock
solutions for pyrimethamine, cycloguanil and
wr99210 were prepared by dissolving each drug
at 1 mg ml − 1 in  xxxd102xxx  overnight. stock
solutions were aliquoted and stored at −70°c.
chloroquine was dissolved at 3.13 ×10 − 3 m in
 xxxd102xxx  and  xxxd2258xxx  at 1 × 10 − 3 m
in 70% ethanol; both were stored at −20°c. all
dilutions of drugs were made serially into medium
lacking nitrogen (1.61 g yeast nitrogen base without amino acids or ammonium sulfate, 11.1 g
 xxxd3251xxx  and 6.7 g naoh l − 1; the level of
 xxxd2146xxx  is 0.0018 mg l − 1 and p-aminobenzoic
acid is 0.19 mg l − 1). the dilutions were stored at
4°c protected from light for up to 5 days. for
drug sensitivity experiments on solid medium,
drugs were spread on the surface of the plate at
the appropriate concentrations and allowed time
to be absorbed into the medium. mixing the drug
into the medium (after it cooled to 55 – 60°c)
before pouring the plates worked equally well.
drug sensitivity tests were made using a ‘‘double
replica plating’’ procedure because this improved
the discrimination of growth. first, yeast strains
of interest were transferred to nonselective
medium (yepd), allowed to grow for 2 days, and
replica plated to another yepd plate. this plate

29

was then immediately replica plated to a test plate
containing drug and control plate without drug.
after 5 days of growth, each strain was scored for
sensitivity by comparison with growth on the
control plate without drug.
the quantitative drug sensitivity assays were
carried out in liquid culture in the following manner. each yeast strain was grown up to midlog
phase (5× 106 –2× 107 cells ml − 1) in ym-1
medium and this culture was diluted to 104 cells
ml − 1 in medium and aliquoted into 5 ml cultures.
drug was added to cultures at various concentrations but at constant volume to create a drug
concentration series. each concentration point
was done in duplicate. the cultures were incubated on a roller (new brunswick scientific, new
brunswick, nj) for 24 h, after which growth was
determined by measuring the absorbance at 660
nm on a spectophotometer (gilford instrument
stasar ii). a growth period of 24 h insured that
all samples would still be actively growing in log
phase at the end of the experiment. the drug
sensitivity curve was generated by expressing the
growth at each concentration point as a percentage of the growth of the control sample without
drug.

3. results

3.1. the p. falciparum dhfr gene can supply the
enzyme function in dhfr-yeast
to determine whether the p. falciparum dhfr
gene could provide the enzyme function in s.
cere6isiae that lack dhfr activity, we made the
construct diagrammed in fig. 1a. the 600 bp
region from the 5% promoter of the s. cere6isiae
dhfr gene [32] was cloned 5% of the dhfr domain
from the p. falciparum dhfr-ts gene from d6 [31]
and the translation termination and 3% termination
region from the s. cere6isiae dhfr gene were added
3% of the pf-dhfr-d6 coding region gene [32]. this
hybrid gene was inserted into the prs314 plasmid
that carries s. cere6isiae sequences that allow
autonomous replication of the plasmid in yeast,
and centromere sequences to assure that the plasmid is maintained at a low copy number [36].

30

several control plasmids were also made: a hybrid
construct with the pf-dhfr-d6 coding and yeast 3%
regions in reverse orientation, and a yeast construct that lacked the 3% region altogether. in
addition, we made a construct with the dhfr coding region from s. cere6isiae ligated back to the
yeast 5% and 3% regions to compare with a complete sc-dhfr gene. this was designed to assure
that the two restriction sites that flank the pfdhfr-d6 did not reduce activity. these plasmids
were transformed into the th5 mutant
(dfr1::ura3 ) that lacked endogenous dhfr activity [27] and transformants were selected by
growth on plates without tryptophan, but supplemented with  xxxd3365xxx . the resulting transformants
were then tested for their ability to grow in the
absence of  xxxd3365xxx .
we first determined whether complementation
of the yeast dhfr defect depended on the presence of the yeast 5% and 3% control regions and a
dhfr coding region. the dhfr-mutant and the
transformant containing the vector alone were
unable to grow on plates that lacked  xxxd3365xxx , but
the pf-dhfr-d6 transformant and the sc-dhfr
transformants grew equally well in the presence or
absence of  xxxd3365xxx . this demonstrated that the
pf-dhfr-d6 gene can supply the enzyme function
(fig. 1b). yeast growth was indistinguishable in
transformants that expressed the sc-dhfr construct
that contained the flanking restriction sites and
the construct that lacked the sites (data not
shown), suggesting that the restriction sites we
introduced did not interfere with the function of
the gene. as expected, neither the hybrid gene
that lacked the yeast 3% sequences, nor the construct in reverse orientation showed any growth in
the absence of  xxxd3365xxx . while the pf-dhfr-d6
transformant did not grow as well as the wild type
parent strain, its growth was comparable to that
of the transformant containing the sc-dhfr plasmid. we also made yeast strains in which the
pf-dhfr-d6 gene was integrated into the dhfr locus
and these showed more vigorous growth, comparable to that observed for wild type yeast.
these observations suggest that the reduced
growth of the pf-dhfr-d6 transformant is not a
consequence of the heterologous nature of the
plasmodium enzyme, but probably results from

the differences between the truncated promoter
used to express the dhfr on the plasmid and the
full promoter that drives chromosomal expression.
to insure that the observed phenotype was due
to the construct used for the transformation and
not a change in the biology of the yeast host,
plasmid dna was isolated from each transformant and transferred into e. coli [30,35]. the
plasmid dna was analyzed by restriction digests
and then used to transform a new yeast dhfr-mutant host. in all cases, the original phenotype was
observed in the transformant. these results together show that the pf-dhfr enzyme can supply the function for yeast and that these regions
of the yeast dhfr gene promoter and terminator
are necessary and sufficient for low expression of
the pf-dhfr gene in s. cere6isiae.
the dhfr enzyme activity is required for the
biosynthesis of other metabolites in addition to
 xxxd3365xxx  (fig. 2). growth of the yeast dhfr-mutant
requires supplementation with adenine, histidine,
and methionine as well as  xxxd3365xxx  [27]. therefore,
if the pf-dhfr-d6 enzyme can complement all
of the functions of the yeast dhfr enzyme, the
pf-dhfr-d6 transformants should no longer be
auxotrophic for these other metabolites. this prediction was tested by transferring the pf-dhfr-d6
transformant to plates that lacked methionine,

(dhf) is converted to tetrahydrofolate (thf) by the enzyme
 xxxg631xxx  (dhfr). thf is used as a cofactor in
the biosynthesis of  xxxd3365xxx  and other metabolites.

histidine or adenine (table 1). neither the dhfrmutant nor the transformant containing the vector alone was able to grow when any of these
three metabolites was missing from the growth
medium. however, the pf-dhfr-d6 transformant
grew as well as the sc-dhfr transformant under all
of these conditions. this demonstrates that all of
the functions of the dhfr were restored in the
pf-dhfr-d6 transformant and that the pf-dhfr

enzyme serves the major functions of the yeast
folate pathway.

tive inhibitor of the p. falciparum enzyme. to test
for drug sensitivity, the growth of the pf-dhfr-d6
transformant was examined on medium containing pyrimethamine (fig. 3). the growth of wild
type yeast and the transformant containing the
yeast dhfr construct (sc-dhfr) was unaffected
by pyrimethamine concentrations as high as 4 ×
10 − 5 m, a level high enough to kill the most
resistant strains of p. falciparum [1]. in contrast,
the growth of the pf-dhfr-d6 transformant was
inhibited at 4×10 − 7 m pyrimethamine, a concentration comparable to the range of sensitivity
seen in p. falciparum itself [1]. this demonstrates
that the sensitivity of s. cere6isiae to
pyrimethamine depends on the origin of the
dhfr enzyme.
the drug sensitivity of the pf-dhfr-d6 transformant was characterized more quantitatively by
measuring the growth of the transformant in liquid culture. a single colony was picked, and its

growth was tested in the presence of
pyrimethamine at concentrations ranging from 0
to 5× 10 − 5 m. the pf-dhfr-d6 transformant was
sensitive to pyrimethamine concentrations comparable to those that inhibit p. falciparum in the
standard short-term in 6itro assay; the ic50 was
2× 10 − 8 m [1]. the growth of the sc-dhfr transformant was unaffected by pyrimethamine up to
1× 10 − 5 m; effects at higher concentrations were
identical to those observed when the solvent alone
was tested (fig. 4a). two other dhfr inhibitors
were tested on these pf-dhfr-d6 cells: cycloguanil
and wr99210, an experimental drug that is also
thought to inhibit p. falciparum by inhibition of
dhfr [5,6]. both drugs gave comparable results;
the s. cere6isiae cells that expressed the pf-dhfrd6 were sensitive to cycloguanil and wr99210 at
levels comparable to the ic50 measured for each
drug in p. falciparum (data not shown). as before, the s. cere6isiae transformants that expressed the sc-dhfr were unaffected by either
antimalaria drug.
to assure that the inhibition by pyrimethamine
targeted the pf-dhfr-d6, the assay was used to
compare the growth of the pf-dhfr-d6 transformant in choloroquine and  xxxd2258xxx , two antimalaria drugs that do not interfere with dhfr
function (fig. 4b) [1]. no inhibition of growth
was observed in cultures grown in either
chloroquine or  xxxd2258xxx  except at levels where
the solvent alone caused inhibition. thus, the
sensitivity of the pfdhfr s. cere6isiae is specific
to the drugs that target dhfr, as one would
expect.

3.3. the drug sensiti6ity of pfdhfr yeast is
dependent on the dhfr allele from which the
construct was deri6ed
if the yeast system is to be useful, then the drug
sensitivity of a transformed strain must depend on
the dhfr domain used to make the expression
construct, and allow discrimination of subtle differences between alleles of dhfr. to determine
whether this is the case, constructs were made
using the dhfr genes from the pyrimethamine-resistant strains honduras l (pf-dhfr-hon) and
mikenga (pf-dhfr-mik). the resistance of the

as described in section 2.

honduras 1 strain has been shown to result from
a single point mutation changing the ser usually
found at amino acid 108 to asn. its ic50 for
pyrimethamine was reported to be about 250 [19]
to 6000 times [18] higher than that of d6. the
ic50 for pyrimethamine of the mikenga strain was
about 5 ×10 − 6 m, (about 260 times that of the
sensitive d6 strain), but the dna sequence of the
dhfr gene had not been previously characterized.
we determined the dna sequence of the dhfr
allele isolated from the mikenga strain; its resistance to pyrimethamine results only from two
mutations in the dhfr domain, an asn108 and ile51
(table 3). this is the same set of mutations previously observed in two other parasites, 7g8 and
it.d12 that are reported to be 2500 times and
between 1 and 3000 times more resistant to
pyrimethamine than is the d6 strain [18,19].

the drug sensitivity of transformants expressing these genes was then compared with that of
the pf-dhfr-d6 construct described above. the
constructs were transformed into the yeast dhfrmutant and each dhfr construct complemented the
dhfr defect as shown in table 1. the sensitivity
to pyrimethamine of these three pf-dhfr transformants was compared by transferring patches of
the transformed colonies to plates containing no
drug or pyrimethamine ranging from 5 × l0 − 8 to
5× l0 − 5 m (fig. 5). the growth of the d6-dhfr
transformant was completely inhibited on plates
containing 5× 10 − 7 m pyrimethamine, the hondhfr transformant at 5×10 − 6 m and the mikdhfr transformant at 5× 10 − 5 m. this is the
expected pattern of sensitivity based on resistance
of each of these strains of p. falciparum [15,16]
(jmw unpub). we concluded that the

resistance over the full range of sensitivity
observed in populations of p. falciparum.

pyrimethamine sensitivity of these pf-dhfr
strains reflected the strain of origin for each dhfr
allele.
the resistance of the three transformants was
compared more quantitatively by growing the
cells in liquid culture as described above. the ic50
of the pf-dhfr-d6 transformant was about
3×10 − 8 m pyrimethamine while the ic50 of the
pf-dhfr-hon was 2 ×10 − 6 and pf-dhfr-mik,
4×10 − 6 m (fig. 6a). as one might expect, the
growth on plates containing pyrimethamine and
inhibition of growth in liquid gave slightly
different results; a higher concentration of drug
was required to completely inhibit growth on
plates. however, the data from both the replica
plating and liquid culture assays show that the
yeast system discriminates the differences in drug

if pyrimethamine acts directly on dhfr, one
can make several predictions based on the folate
pathway diagrammed in fig. 2. the predictions
were easily tested in yeast, since the pathway is
well known, and the tests of function required
simple replica plating on medium with defined
nutritional requirements. for example, yeast with
the pf-dhfr-d6 allele should again require
supplementation with  xxxd3365xxx , adenine, methionine
and histidine for growth in the presence of
pyrimethamine. tetrahydrofolate (thf), the
product of the dhfr enzyme activity, is required
for synthesis of all of the other metabolites listed
in fig. 2. therefore, a second prediction is that
inclusion of tetrahydrofolate in the medium
should overcome the effects of pyrimethamine.
we compared the growth of transformants
carrying three different plasmids: pyrs pf-dhfrd6, pyrr pf-dhfr-hon and the yeast sc-dhfr
(table 2). the growth of the pf-dhfr-d6
transformant was inhibited by pyrimethamine,
while the growth of the sc-dhfr transformant
and hon-dhfr transformant were not. the
pyrimethamine-inhibition of growth was reversed
by either thf or  xxxd3365xxx  when the d6-dhfr
transformant was tested on plates containing
methionine, histidine and adenine. however,

were generated as described in legend to fig. 4. ic50 indicated

supplementing the medium with  xxxd3365xxx  did not
permit growth in pyrimethamine if histidine was
also withheld, as expected. identical results were
observed when either adenine or methionine was
withheld from the medium (data not shown).
under the same conditions, the transformant that
expressed hon-dhfr did grow, although somewhat
weakly. no effect on growth of the sc-dhfr transformant was observed. these results serve as
strong functional evidence that the drug sensitivity of pf-dhfr in yeast results from inhibition of
the dhfr enzyme in the folate pathway.

3.5. the pf-dhfr yeast can be used to predict
response to experimental drugs that may act as
inhibitors of dhfr
the d6, honduras and mikenga strains of p.
falciparum from which the three dhfr alleles were

isolated are all efficiently killed by the experimental antimalaria drug, wr99210 [4–6]. in contrast,
the sc-dhfr yeast were insensitive to wr99210,
even  xxxd1891xxx  − 5 m (data not shown). when the
growth in liquid culture was used to compare the
drug sensitivity of each transformant to
wr99210, all three were efficiently inhibited at
about 10 − 8 m wr99210 (fig. 7). in fact, the
transformants containing dhfr alleles from the
pyrimethamine resistant strains, honduras and
mikenga were more sensitive to wr99210 than
the d6-dhfr transformant, a phenomenon known
as collateral hypersensitivity [38].
the ic50 values for inhibition of growth of the
three pf-dhfr strains in liquid cultures for
pyrimethamine, wr99210, and cycloguanil are
compared in table 3. several conclusions can be
drawn. first, the small standard deviations of the
measurements demonstrate that this system provides a very precise measurement of the drug
sensitivity of a dhfr allele. this degree of precision
is much greater than that currently obtainable in
p. falciparum using standard in vitro drug sensitivity assays [1]. second, the expected patterns of
sensitivity were observed for all three drugs. the
p. falciparum strains honduras 1 and mikenga
are moderately resistant to cycloguanil but they
are two to three orders of magnitude more resistant to pyrimethamine than is d6. in contrast, all
three strains of p. falciparum are very efficiently
killed by wr99210. these are exactly the patterns
of sensitivity we observed when these dhfr alleles
were tested in the yeast transformed with each
dhfr allele.

4. discussion
the experiments described here are the first step
in establishing a system for estimating rapidly and
quantitatively the potential of a dhfr inhibitor
for selecting populations of p. falciparum resistant
to the drug. we have demonstrated that the
dhfr enzyme from p. falciparum can supply the
enzyme function in dhfr -s. cere6isiae. furthermore, the sensitivity of the transformed yeast to
antimalaria drugs that target dhfr depends
only upon the allele they express. thus, one can
now treat yeast that express a drug-sensitive allele
of dhfr with a drug, and select resistant yeast
colonies for analysis of the frequency and mechanism of their drug resistance.
we made a number of choices in the original
design of our experiments. first, we used only
portions of the 5% and 3% regulatory elements from
s. cere6isiae. the sequences of these regions were
known [32] and our goal was to express the
pf-dhfr at low levels. in fact, our choice of only
600 bp of the 5% region resulted in expression that
was considerably lower than the yeast gene with
the full upstream 5% regions (compare the wild
type and two plasmid constructs in fig. 1). this
low level of expression was our intent, since, as
one would predict, high level expression of the
wild type enzyme from a high copy number plasmid or linked to its full promoter does confer
resistance to high levels of pyrimethamine, cycloguanil or wr99210 (k. hamilton and s.
mookherjee, personal communication). the dependence of the yeast upon this minimal level of
dhfr activity allows one to see easily rather
subtle effects of the inhibitors on the enzyme,
simply by observing the growth of the culture on
plates or in liquid.
we also chose to make our constructs with only
the coding region of the dhfr domain from p.
falciparum, even though the enzyme activity is
normally part of a bifunctional dhfr-ts enzyme
[20,31]. in yeast, dhfr and ts are encoded by
separate genes and the yeast host expressed normal levels of ts [27]. this choice avoided potential problems stemming from an overexpression of
ts. in addition, sirawaraporn and his colleagues
showed that constructs that contained the dhfr

domain alone have kinetic parameters that are
very similar to those measured in vitro for the
bifunctional dhfr-ts enzyme [7]. for detailed
studies of biochemical parameters of the dhfr
enzyme, we intend to make similar constructs that
do contain both the dhfr and ts domains from p.
falciparum.
we observed that the growth of the transformed yeast was equivalent whether the plasmid
expressed the yeast or the p. falciparum dhfr
(compare sc-dhfr and pf-dhfr-d6 in fig. 1).
this was a bit of a surprise. since dhfr functions as a complex with ts in many protists [20],
it has been argued that the association of the two
domains is important for the efficient coupling of
the sequential enzyme activities [39]. with this in
mind, one might predict that the single dhfr
domain would not interact very efficiently with
the ts from s. cere6isiae and would support yeast
growth somewhat less efficiently than the yeast
dhfr enzyme. the data in fig. 1 suggest that
the heterologous enzyme functions just as well in
the yeast folate pathway as the native enzyme.
the antimalaria drugs examined in this study
inhibited growth of the d6-dhfr transformants at
about the same concentrations that inhibit p.
falciparum itself. this was fortuitous, but does
allow a fairly direct comparison of the effectiveness of particular dhfr inhibitors in the yeast
transformants and p. falciparum itself. the correspondence will permit us to monitor the emergence of drug resistant populations at
concentrations that resemble those that are likely
to be operating in the actual clinical situation.
the effectiveness of low drug concentrations also
demonstrated that the yeast were permeable to the
antimalaria drugs. this was a concern, since s.
cere6isiae are frequently insensitive to exogenous
toxins simply because they exclude them from the
cells or actively excrete them [40,41]. for example,
yeast cells do not normally take up  xxxd3365xxx  and the
selection of dhfr-mutant cells required that the
mutants be maintained by  xxxd3365xxx  addition to the
medium. to isolate the original dhfr-mutant,
huang and his co-workers used a parental strain,
th1, that had been first selected for the tup1
mutation that allows thymidine uptake. we did
not determine whether the tup1 mutation was

j.m. wooden et al. / molecular and biochemical parasitology 85 (1997) 25–40

necessary for efficient uptake of the dhfr inhibitors we employed, but all of our experiments
were done in a tup1 background.
assays of drug sensitivity on plates or in liquid
culture gave comparable results with the three
strains and the range of measurement spanned
three orders of magnitude in sensitivity to
pyrimethamine and cycloguanil. furthermore,
honduras 1 (asn108) is somewhat less resistant to
pyrimethamine than is mikenga (ile51asn108) and
even this subtle difference was observed both on
the plates and during growth in liquid. in table 3,
we have used the ic50 values to compare the
relative effectiveness of each of the drugs in yeast
and in p. falciparum. this is easy because the ic50
we measure in liquid culture is analogous to the
ic50 commonly used to compare the response of
different strains of in malaria to particular drugs
[1].
the reproducibility of the ic50 measurements in
the pf-dhfr yeast was far better than comparable
measurements in p. falciparum in vitro [1]. this is
probably due to the extremely low level of folate
and para-aminobenzoic acid in the yeast growth
medium. this is in contrast to culture of p.
falciparum where the standard rpmi medium
contains 1 mg l − 1 of  xxxd2146xxx  and paraaminobenzoic acid. the variation in the levels of
folate in the human serum and  xxxd187xxx  also
contirbute to the variation in culture conditions of
the p. falciparum. data were compiled from a
number of different publications where an ic50
was determined for laboratory strains of p. falciparum. the values given were determined in standard rpmi, and all labs used the standard
3
h-hypoxanthine uptake assay [42]. the relative
sensitivity of the pyrs d6 and the pyrr strains,
honduras 1 and its parent line, hb3 (that carry
the mutation to asn108) was compared with the
sensitivity of 7g8 and it.d12, two strains that
carry the ile51 and asn108 mutations that were
observed in the dhfr allele from mikenga. in each
case, the relative resistance is the ratio of the ic50
of the sensitive strain compared with the ic50 for
the resistant strain. it is striking that the values
reported by different labs can differ by more than
an order of magnitude. for example, the reported
relative resistance of hb3 ranges from 260 to

37

5258 [15,18,19]. variability of this kind is not
clinically important; all groups agree in the assignment of strains to the pyrs and pyrr categories. however, table 3 shows that in the yeast
system, the measurement of relative sensitivity to
any of these drugs is easy and reproducible. this
precision will allow direct assessment of the contribution of each amino acid change to the overall
resistance of the enzyme to a particular drug.
wr99210 is the active metabolite of ps-15, one
of several promising drugs that are potent inhibitors of pf-dhfr in vitro [4]. wr99210 is effective even against strains that are extremely
resistant to pyrimethamine and cycloguanil, like
the honduras 1 and mikenga strains used here. in
fact, both of these pyrimethamine- and cycloguanil-resistant strains were more sensitive to
wr99210 than was the pyrimethamine-sensitive
d6. this collateral hypersensitivity has been observed for other drug targets where a series of
related drugs was compared [38]. the major difference between the d6 and the two pyrr strains
is the presence of asn rather than ser at the 108
position. detailed binding and structural studies
will be required to identify the cause of the increased susceptibility of these two strains to
wr99210. in any case, if strains that express the
asn108 are generally more susceptible to this new
drug, it raises the hope that ps-15 may be particularly effective against the pyrimethamine-and cycloguanil-resistant strains that already prevail in
large regions of southeast asia and south america and are developing rapidly in africa [2,13,14].
at this point, the effectiveness of wr99210 has
been demonstrated in vitro, but it is not yet
known whether all of its action is directed against
dhfr [4–6]. when we tested the drug against
the yeast transformants expressing each dhfr allele, wr99210 efficiently killed all of them, but
the ic50 was about 10 − 8, almost an order of
magnitude higher than the comparable measurement in p. falciparum (milhous, w. wrair internal document; jmw, unpublished). one
explanation of this discrepancy could be that
wr99210 inhibits more than one function in p.
falciparum. further experiments will be required
to test this idea, but the yeast system affords a
quick, quantitative way to determine whether a

38

j.m. wooden et al. / molecular and biochemical parasitology 85 (1997) 25–40

drug really does target the pf-dhfr and if it does,
to separate that action from inhibition of other
functions in p. falciparum.
the basic strategy used here may be applicable
to the study of resistance to a number of other
antimalaria drugs. the requirements are clear.
first, the drug must inhibit a particular p. falciparum enzyme, either as a competitive inhibitor of
the enzyme or by binding to a region other than
the active site. second, the homologous enzyme
activity must also operate in s. cere6isiae. third,
the mechanism of resistance must depend on mutations in the gene, not on increases in gene
expression or changes in other genes that affect
the cell biology of p. falciparum. fourth, the s.
cere6isiae must be permeable to the drug in question and the subcellular localization of the enzyme
and the drug must be the same in both systems. a
number of malaria enzymes appear to conform to
these requirements. dihydropteroate synthase, the
target of sulfa drugs [40], topoisomerases i and ii,
the target of quinolones [41,42] and ornithine
decarboxylase, the target of  xxxd2430xxx  and novel tetraamines [43,44] are all possible candidates for studies of this sort.
these experiments make it clear that one can
study the effect of antimalaria drugs that target
the dhfr enzyme of p. falciparum by transferring the malaria enzyme into s. cere6isiae. the
ease of growth and manipulation of the yeast
make it easy to measure the sensitivity of any
particular dhfr allele to potential inhibitors of
pf-dhfr. more important, it will allow us now
to measure the efficiency with which resistant
mutants to any particular dhfr inhibitors are
selected. a drug or combination of drugs that
show a very low capacity to select resistant populations in the yeast system will be a valuable lead
in the development of drugs of this class that
remain clinically useful for treatment of p. falciparum over much longer periods than those observed for pyrimethamine and cycloguanil.
