case report

central pain after pontine infarction is
associated with changes in opioid receptor
binding: a pet study with 11c- xxxd1913xxx 
frode willoch, thomas rudolf tölle, hans jürgen wester, frank munz,
axel petzold, markus schwaiger, bastian conrad, and peter bartenstein

et al (6) have reported changes in 11c- xxxd1913xxx  binding in relation to inflammation and pain
in a few patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
in this study, alterations in opioid receptor binding, measured with the nonselective ligand 11c- xxxd1913xxx , are reported in a patient with a pontine lesion causing central poststroke pain and
compared with changes in glucose metabolism.

summary: using 18f-fluorodeoxyglucose and 11c- xxxd1913xxx  positron emission tomography (pet), we investigated alterations in glucose metabolism and opioid receptor
binding in a patient with central poststroke pain, which
developed after a small pontine hemorrhagic infarction. in
comparison with normal databases, reduced 11c- xxxd1913xxx  binding was more accentuated than the hypometabolism on the lateral cortical surface contralateral to the
symptoms, and a differential abnormal distribution between the tracers was seen in pain-related central structures. these results show that 11c- xxxd1913xxx  pet provides unique information for the understanding of central
poststroke pain.

case report
clinical findings
a 77-year-old right-handed man experienced a hemorrhagic
brain infarction 14 months before the study. a ct scan (fig
1a) on the day of the event revealed a hyperdense lesion,
approximately 1 cm in diameter, in the right paramedian mid
pons region. motor symptoms dominated initially after the infarction; however, in the following months, a slowly progressive painful dysesthesia of pricking and lacerating character
developed on the entire left side of the body. at the time of
the study, the pain was continuous, except for cessation after
long periods of complete rest. painful overreactions were provoked by touch or movement, with generalization of pain sensation restricted to the left half of the body and head. the pain
was refractory to medical treatment and to physiotherapeutic
trials. medication with opiates (tramadolol hydrochloride,
maximum dosage 300 mg/day) resulted only in transient pain
relief in the initial period of treatment.
clinical examination at the time of the study showed slight
left-sided distal loss of power, and a mild left-sided spasticity.
there was a distinct decrease in sensibility to touch, temperature, and pin-prick on the left side compared with the healthy
hemibody. position sense, vibration, and stereognosis were unimpaired. the patient had a slightly ataxic gait, left-sided dysdiadochokinesia, and poor knee-heel performance. no impairments of mental state (mini-mental status examination, 30/30)
or speech function were noted, and general physical examination was normal.
at the time of the study, the mr examination (t2*-weighted
gradient-echo sequence) revealed a unilateral hypodense lesion
of approximately 3 3 6 mm at the location of the infarction.
the affected structures were the medial lemniscus and the spinothalamic tract, including trigeminal fibers rostral to the level
of contralateral crossing, and the reticular formation. there
was no evidence of a thalamic lesion or other cerebral vascular
events (fig 1b).
electrically evoked somatosensory cerebral potentials
showed an increased latency for the left trigeminal, median,
peroneal, and femoral nerve, consistent with the radiologic
findings. pain recordings using a heat thermode also indicated
a unilateral impairment of the spinothalamic pathways. nerve
conduction velocity, electromyography, electroencephalography, and magnetic evoked potentials were all normal.

dejérine and roussy (1) first described central
pain in 1906 using the expression thalamic pain
based on the findings of thalamic lesions. central
pain is defined by the international association for
the study of pain (2) as pain of cns origin ‘‘including thalamic and pseudothalamic pain’’ as
‘‘diffuse, unilateral pain, often burning with allodynia, hypoesthesia, hypalgesia, hyperpathia, dysesthesia, and neurological signs of damage to
structures which supply the affected region.’’ radiologic studies have shown that lesions that induce
central pain may be located at any level along the
neuraxis (3) of the cns, including the brain stem.
pain-related structures have been identified
through changes in regional cerebral blood flow or
glucose metabolism, and a few studies have specifically dealt with central poststroke pain (4, 5).

medication directly interfering with the opioid system was
discontinued 4 months before positron emission tomography
(pet) was performed.
imaging findings
the patient and 11 healthy volunteers (mean age, 37; range,
23 to 67 years) underwent a dynamic 11c- xxxd1913xxx  study
(7) with arterial sampling and metabolite correction (8) after
injection of a mean doses of 480 mbq. additionally, the patient underwent an 18f-fluorodeoxyglucose (fdg)-pet study
(370 mbq), with data acquisition between 30 and 60 minutes
after injection. fdg-pet data were compared with a normal
database consisting of an age-matched control group of 18
healthy volunteers (mean age, 70 years; range, 63 to 82 years).
all subjects gave informed written consent. all studies were
approved by the ethics committee of medicine of the technische universität münchen and the radiation protection
authorities.
spectral analysis (9) was applied on a voxel-by-voxel basis
to extract the opioid receptor availability of 11c- xxxd1913xxx 
using the impulse response function at 60 minutes (irf60,
[min21]) (9, 10) (fig 1c). the regional values of irf60 and
fdg data were assessed by a volume-of-interest (voi) analysis with exact placement of each voi, 1.2 cm in diameter,
ensured by superimposition onto the individual mr images
(11). additionally, the voi-derived values were used to calculate asymmetry indexes (ai) between the hemispheres (7)
according to the following formula: ai 5 (left 2 right) 3 100/
[(left 1 right)/2]. an observer-independent automated program
was used for the pixelwise statistical analysis (12, 13) of the
regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose. the data sets were

normalized to the hemisphere with the higher average value to
avoid a possible influence of functional deactivation of the
cortical activity by the lesion (4, 5). a region of interest (roi)
analysis was performed on the resulting z-score maps in the
regions equivalent to the voi. a similar procedure was applied
to binding potential images of 11c- xxxd1913xxx , which were
generated using the occipital cortex as reference tissue (7, 8,
14). z-scores presented are average scores in each selected
brain region.
owing to the high interindividual variance, the absolute
quantification of 11c- xxxd1913xxx  binding expressed by the
irf60 did not show values outside the normal range (mean
value of the lateral cortical hemisphere, 0.1057 2 0.2091
min21) for any region investigated in the patient (lateral cortical hemispheres: left, 0.1783 min21; right, 0.1566 min21).
however, the asymmetry indexes calculated from these images
revealed a decrease in 11c- xxxd1913xxx  binding in the hemisphere contralateral to the clinical symptoms, which was most
pronounced in the lateral hemisphere with 3.25 standard deviations (sd) from the control mean (ai-patient: 13.0%; aicontrols: mean, 0.0%, sd, 4.1%) (figs 1c and 2). this decrease was not matched by an equivalent reduction in fdg
uptake (ai-patient: 5.5%, sd, 1.5 from the control mean; aicontrol: mean, 1.4%, sd, 2.7%) (figs 1d and 3). the pixelwise statistical analysis confirmed the difference between the
lateral cortical hemispheres, including the frontal, parietal, and
temporal cortices except for the primary sensorimotor area
with low opioid receptor density (table). further, a pronounced
relative bilateral (right . left) reduction in opioid receptor
binding was shown in pain-related central structures, including
the orbitofrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate, and the insula

medial, left lateral, right (rt.) lateral and right medial surfaces. a marked asymmetry is seen between the left and right lateral surfaces
in the patient with less binding on the right cortical surface. an apparent bilateral reduction in binding is identifiable on the medial
surfaces of the patient’s images in comparison with the control mean. in contrast to the fdg data, reduced 11c- xxxd1913xxx  binding
is emphasized in the orbitofrontal cortex and in anterior parts of the cingulate cortex (regions with high opioid receptor density).

(table and fig 2). within these structures a decrease in glucose
metabolism was observed (table and fig 3). however, the
overall pattern of the impaired fdg uptake and the reduction
in 11c- xxxd1913xxx  binding was different. reduction in 11cdiprenorphine binding was more pronounced in anterior parts
of the medial surface while hypometabolism was emphasized
along the posterior cingulate, an area with lower opioid receptor density (fig 2).
because it was not possible to obtain an age-matched control
population for the 11c- xxxd1913xxx  study, the possible influence of age on 11c- xxxd1913xxx  binding was investigated.
age-related effects on 11c- xxxd1913xxx  binding were not
found in the literature (14) nor in our database. gender-specific
differences in binding previously described (15) are not relevant
in this comparison, since all control subjects were also males.

discussion
in this study, changes in glucose metabolism and
opioid receptor binding in a patient with central
poststroke pain were assessed using fdg and the
nonselective opioid receptor ligand 11c- xxxd1913xxx . the rare location and limited boundaries of
infarction as well as its predominant sensory clinical expression allowed a functional investigation
of central poststroke pain in morphologically preserved brain structures.
although the spectral analysis elegantly offers
absolute estimates of receptor availability, the in-

terindividual variance extended over a wide range.
this problem is common to all attempts thus far to
absolutely quantify receptor-ligand interaction (16).
the reference tissue model is a well-validated approach widely used in pet studies with 11c- xxxd1913xxx  and other opioid receptor ligands (7,
8, 14). within a wide, reliable range, the ratio values show a linear relationship to k3/k4 (8), and the
images produced are less sensitive to noise artifacts
introduced by various parameters necessary for
modeling, such as metabolite correction, arterial input function, scale factors, and so on. therefore,
this model was chosen for the statistical comparison to the normal database.
this case study provides the first report of in
vivo changes in opioid receptor binding in central
pain syndrome after brain infarction. the most likely explanation for the observed decreases in receptor binding in pain-related structures is competition
with the exogenous ligand due to tonic enhancement of intrasynaptic endogenous opioid peptide
levels, as discussed by jones et al (6), and/or loss
of receptor binding sites (17) caused by increased
neurotransmission of the endorphin-mediating analgesia system. another consequence of the increased levels of endogenous peptides may be a
receptor desensitization and opioid tolerance (17),

examination, there is a slight asymmetry between the lateral surfaces. more obvious changes in comparison with the control mean are
seen on the medial surfaces along the cingulate cortex with a bilateral reduced glucose utilization, especially pronounced in the posterior
areas. the hypometabolism at the right upper temporal lobe in the patient is due to a wide sylvian fissure (fig 1b).

which would also explain the poor response in the
patient to potent opioid analgesics. thus, the data
suggest that the alteration of the opioid system affects predominantly structures associated with the
medial pain system (cingulate, orbitofrontal cortex,
and insula) in concordance with the observations

of jones et al (6) in arthritis patients in the painful
state. however, the accentuated reduction in 11cdiprenorphine binding on the lateral cortical surface was not observed in their patients. this can be
explained by the peripheral origin of their pain syndrome with no central lesion present. previous reports of thalamic pain syndromes have described
slight metabolic changes in extended areas of the
hemisphere contralateral to symptoms (4, 5). the
presence of abnormalities in cortical function extending beyond the medial pain system in central
pain syndromes is further supported by the findings
of this study. glucose metabolism reflects only total regional synaptic activity in the cns and does
not differentiate between changes in different neurotransmitter systems. in contrast, the imaging of
specific neurotransmitter systems, especially the
opioid receptor system, may provide unique information for the understanding of pathophysiological
mechanisms underlying central pain-related hyperpathia and dysesthesia. studies in a larger patient
population with different lesions along the neuraxis
will be necessary to fully elucidate the role of the
opioids in the pathophysiology of central pain.
