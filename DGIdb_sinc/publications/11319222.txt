acyl-coa synthetase (acs,1 ec 6.2.1.3) catalyzes the ligation of long chain  xxxd2154xxx  with  xxxd1739xxx  (coa) to produce
long chain acyl-coas (1). the resulting acyl-coas can be further metabolized in pathways of ␤-oxidation, glycerolipid synthesis, cholesteryl ester (ce) synthesis, desaturation, elongation, and protein acylation and can serve as signaling
molecules (2– 4). although acs was first believed to be a constitutive enzyme because the activity in liver was not altered by
changes in nutritional status or hormonal stimuli (5–9), the
cloning of  xxxg47xxx  from rat liver in 1990 disclosed that hepatic
 xxxg47xxx  mrna expression is sensitively regulated by fasting and
refeeding as well as by specific nutrients provided as the energy
source (10). later, four additional rat acs isoforms from different genes were cloned that differed in tissue distribution of
their mrna expression and in substrate preference (11–14). of
these, acs2 and  xxxg48xxx  mrnas are abundantly expressed in
brain, but are not detected in liver (13, 14). the mrnas of
 xxxg49xxx  and acs5 are highly expressed in steroidogenic tissues
and in intestine, respectively, and are also present in liver (11,
12).  xxxg47xxx  and acs5 have a broad substrate specificity for
saturated  xxxd2154xxx  of 12–18 carbon atoms and unsaturated
 xxxd2154xxx  of 16 –20 carbon atoms. in contrast,  xxxg49xxx  has a
marked preference for  xxxd208xxx  and eicosapentaenoic
acid. the presence of three acs isoforms in liver suggests that
liver acs activity does not change with physiological alterations (5–9) because the different acs isoenzymes compensate
for each other.
all acs isoenzymes are members of the luciferase superfamily and have a common structure that consists of an n terminus, two luciferase-like regions, a linker connecting the two
luciferase-like regions, and a c terminus. a highly conserved
amp-binding site and a predicted fatty acid binding site are
located in the first and the second luciferase-like regions, respectively (10 –14).  xxxg47xxx , acs2, and acs5 are structurally
similar, with more than 60% amino acid identity (11).  xxxg48xxx 
and  xxxg49xxx  form a second subgroup with ⬃30% homology to
 xxxg47xxx  and 68% identity to each other (12). despite their high
degree of homology, the expression of  xxxg47xxx  and acs5 mrna is
regulated independently. in liver, both  xxxg47xxx  and acs5
mrnas are increased by high sucrose refeeding whereas high
fat refeeding increases only  xxxg47xxx  mrna. acs5 is the sole
member of the acs family whose mrna decreases with fasting
(11). in 3t3-l1 cells,  xxxg47xxx  mrna is detected only after adipocyte differentiation, whereas acs5 mrna is consistently
expressed independent of differentiation status (10, 11). in the

inhibition by triacsins and troglitazone of long chain
fatty acid incorporation into cellular lipids suggests the
existence of inhibitor-sensitive and -resistant acyl-coa
synthetases (acs, ec 6.2.1.3) that are linked to specific
metabolic pathways. in order to test this hypothesis, we
cloned and purified rat  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5, the isoforms present in liver and fat cells, expressed the isoforms as acs-flag fusion proteins in escherichia coli,
and purified them by flag affinity chromatography. the
flag epitope at the c terminus did not alter the kinetic
properties of the enzyme. purified  xxxg47xxx -, 4-, and 5-flag
isoforms differed in their apparent km values for atp,
thermolability, ph optima, requirement for triton
x-100, and sensitivity to  xxxd2684xxx  and phenylglyoxal. the acs inhibitor triacsin c strongly inhibited
 xxxg47xxx  and  xxxg49xxx , but not acs5. the thiazolidinedione
(tzd) insulin-sensitizing drugs and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ␥ (ppar␥) ligands, troglitazone, rosiglitazone, and pioglitazone, strongly and specifically inhibited only  xxxg49xxx , with an ic50 of less than
1.5 ␮m. troglitazone exhibited a mixed type inhibition of
 xxxg49xxx . ␣-tocopherol, whose ring structure forms the
non-tzd portion of troglitazone, did not inhibit  xxxg49xxx ,
indicating that the thiazolidine- xxxd309xxx  moiety is the
critical component for inhibition. a non-tzd ppar␥
ligand, gw1929, which is 7-fold more potent than rosiglitazone, inhibited  xxxg47xxx  and  xxxg49xxx  poorly with an ic50 of
greater than 50 ␮m, more than 100-fold higher than was
required for rosiglitazone, thereby demonstrating the
specificity of tzd inhibition. further, the ppar␣ ligands,  xxxd1724xxx  and gw4647, and various xenobiotic
carboxylic acids known to be incorporated into complex
lipids had no effect on  xxxg47xxx , -4, or -5. these results,
together with previous data showing that triacsin c and
troglitazone strongly inhibit triacylglycerol synthesis
compared with other metabolic pathways, suggest that
 xxxg47xxx  and  xxxg49xxx  catalyze the synthesis of acyl-coas used
for triacylglycerol synthesis and that lack of inhibition
of a metabolic pathway by triacsin c does not prove lack
of acyl-coa involvement. the results further suggest the
possibility that the insulin-sensitizing effects of the thiazolidinedione drugs might be achieved, in part, through
direct interaction with  xxxg49xxx  in a ppar␥-independent
manner.

experimental procedures

materials—rt-for-pcr kit and advantage 2 pcr kit were purchased from clontech. bacterial flag expression kit including
pflag-ctc vector, flag m2 affinity column, and flag peptides, aminophenylboronate, phenylglyoxal,  xxxd2684xxx ,  xxxd1739xxx , atp,
palmitate, xenobiotic carboxylic acids, and triton x-100 were from
sigma. hms174(de3) and pet21a(⫹) expression vector were from
novagen. [9,10-3h] xxxd2833xxx  was from perkinelmer life sciences.
triacsin c was from biomol. the thiazolidinediones, gw1929 and
gw4647 were a gift from dr. steven jacobs, glaxosmithkline.
construction of recombinant pacs-flag plasmids—cdna was synthesized from rat liver total rna and used as a template for amplification of the acs open reading frames (clontech, rt-for-pcr kit).
the primers for amplification of  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5 were designed
to include the entire open reading frames based on nucleotide sequences
obtained from the genbank娂 data base (accession nos. d90109,
d85189, and ab012933 for  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5, respectively) and
specific restriction sites. the upper primer for  xxxg47xxx  was 5⬘-acagactcgaggaggtccatgaattgttccgta-3⬘ (recognition site indicated in boldface type) and the lower primer was 5⬘-cctcggtaccaatcttgatggtggagtacag-3⬘. the upper and lower primers for
 xxxg49xxx  were 5⬘-aaaagcttgcaaagagaataaaggctaagc-3⬘ and
5⬘-ttgcgtcgactttgcccccatacatc-3⬘. the upper and lower
primers for acs5 were 5⬘-tattcctcgagctttttatttttaacttcttgttttc-3⬘ and 5⬘-cttggtaccctcttcgatgctcatagag3⬘. acs amplification was performed by pcr with the designed primers
and advantage®2 pcr kit (clontech). the amplified  xxxg47xxx  pcr
product was digested with xhoi and acc65i and ligated into pflag-ctc
vector (sigma) digested with the same restriction enzymes. the  xxxg49xxx 
pcr product and the pflag-ctc vector were digested with hindiii and
sali and then ligated. to obtain  xxxg49xxx  without the flag sequence, a
primer was designed by adding a stop codon in the position just before
the flag sequence. the upper primer used was the same as for acs4flag fusion protein, and the newly designed lower primer was 5⬘acagtgtcgacttatttgcccccatacat-3⬘ (stop codon is under-

lined). the pflag-acs plasmid constructs contain a tac promoter, a
ribosome binding site, the entire coding region of each acs isoforms,
and c-terminal flag sequences with pbr322 origin. for acs5, the
pet-flag vector was used. the plasmid pet-flag was constructed by
cloning the sphi (klenow-filled)-nhei fragment from pet-21a(⫹) (novagen) into pflag-ctc (sigma) digested with bamhi, treated with
klenow, and then digested with nhei. in the pet-flag vector, the tac
promoter region in pflag-ctc was replaced with the t7 promoter
region from pet21a(⫹) (novagen). acs5 pcr products and pet-flag
vector were digested with xhoi and acc65i and then ligated. the
sequences of acs-flag fusion constructs were verified by the university
of north carolina automated sequencing facility.
expression of recombinant  xxxg47xxx - and  xxxg49xxx -flag proteins in escherichia coli—recombinant  xxxg47xxx -flag,  xxxg49xxx -flag, and  xxxg49xxx  were expressed in e. coli jm109 after induction with 1 mm iptg at an a600 of
1.0. jm109 was grown in terrific broth (life technologies, inc.) supplemented with ampicillin (60 ␮g/ml) at 30 °c and shaken at 250 rpm.
after a 12-h induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000
rpm for 10 min in a sorvall hs-4 rotor. the cell pellet was resuspended
in 10 ml of 10 mm tris (ph 7.4), 0.5 mm edta (te) buffer. the
resuspended cells were incubated with 100 ␮g/ml lysozyme for 30 min
on ice and then sonicated with six 10-s bursts, each followed by a 10-s
rest on ice. cellular debris was removed from the cell lysates by centrifugation at 3,000 ⫻ g for 10 min. part of the supernatant was saved
(cell extract), and the remainder was layered over a 2-ml cushion of 55%
(w/w) sucrose topped with 0.5 ml of 5% (w/w) sucrose in te buffer. after
centrifugation in a beckman sw41 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 3 h, the
supernatant was removed (soluble fraction). the membrane band at the
interface was collected with a 19-gauge needle and syringe. protein
concentrations were determined by the bca method (pierce) with bovine  xxxg124xxx  as the standard.
purification of the recombinant  xxxg47xxx - and  xxxg49xxx -flag proteins—
 xxxg47xxx -flag and  xxxg49xxx -flag were purified by flag m2 column chromatography. the flag m2 antibody affinity matrix (1 ml) (sigma) was
activated with 0.1 m glycine (ph 3.5), 50 mm tris (ph 7.4), and 150 mm
nacl (tbs) buffer. jm109 membrane fractions containing overexpressed  xxxg47xxx -flag or  xxxg49xxx -flag were solubilized in tbs containing
1% triton x-100 and passed over the column four times. the column
was washed three times with 12 ml of tbs (ph 7.4), and then eluted
with five 1-ml aliquots of 100 ␮g/ml flag peptide (sigma) dissolved in
tbs buffer (ph 7.4). eluates were run on a 10% polyacrylamide gel
containing 1% sds and stained with gel code® blue stain reagent
(pierce).  xxxg49xxx  and  xxxg47xxx  were purified to near homogeneity and migrated as single bands. compared with the cell extracts the activities of
purified proteins increased 19-fold for  xxxg47xxx  and 10-fold for  xxxg49xxx .
expression and purification of recombinant acs5-flag protein—
unlike  xxxg47xxx - or  xxxg49xxx -flag, acs5-flag protein could not be expressed
under the tac promoter in jm109 or dh5␣. to express acs5-flag, we
used the pet-flag vector because the t7 promoter regulates the expression of foreign proteins more tightly than does the tac promoter.
overexpressed acs5-flag was present in the membrane fraction of
hms174(de3). acs5-flag was maximally expressed at 30 °c after a
12-h induction with 1 mm iptg beginning at an a600 of 0.4 in
hms174(de3), which provides the t7 polymerase. purification of active acs5-flag was similar to that described for  xxxg47xxx  and  xxxg49xxx ,
except that 0.1% triton x-100 was required in the elution buffer that
contained 100 ␮g/ml flag peptide. when triton x-100 was omitted, only
inactive acs was eluted. acs5-flag migrated as a single band on a 10%
polyacrylamide gel containing 1% sds and stained with gel code® blue
stain reagent. compared with the cell extracts, the activities of purified
proteins increased 29-fold for acs5. the purification yield was relatively low because excess protein applied to the column was eluted in
the flow-through fraction and during the washing procedure.
assay for acs activity—the acs assay contained 50 ␮m [3h]palmitate in triton x-100, 1 ␮m edta, 10 mm atp, 250 ␮m coa, 175 mm tris
(ph 7.5), 8 mm mgcl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol in a total of 200 ␮l (20,
21). the maximum concentration of triton x-100 in the assay was
0.03% (0.5 mm). all comparisons of the recombinant acs isoenzymes
employed identical concentrations of substrates and triton x-100. the
reaction was initiated with 0.1 ␮g of protein for  xxxg47xxx  and  xxxg49xxx , and
0.5–1.0 ␮g of protein for acs5. acs activity was measured after a
5-min incubation at 37 °c, except for the inhibition kinetic studies,
which were only incubated for 1 min (20). substrate concentrations and
time allowed measurement of initial rates. the specific activities of
recombinant  xxxg47xxx -,  xxxg49xxx -, and acs5-flag proteins from different
preparations were in the ranges of 939 –1472, 1670 –2200, and 98 –166
nmol/min/mg, respectively. all the experiments were repeated three

adrenal,  xxxg49xxx  expression increases with exposure to  xxxg1801xxx  and to  xxxd208xxx  (15). these differences in regulation, tissue distribution, and substrate preference suggest that each acs isoform might function
independently in various tissues for different metabolic
purposes.
use of two inhibitors of acs has suggested the presence of
different acyl-coa pools within cells, because these inhibitors
are effective in blocking only some of the metabolic pathways
that require long chain acyl-coas. for example, in human
fibroblasts, the fungal metabolite triacsin c almost completely
inhibits de novo synthesis of triacylglycerol and phospholipid
from glycerol, but does not prevent phospholipid synthesis via
reacylation of lysophospholipids with  xxxd2777xxx  or  xxxd208xxx 
(16). similar results are observed in rat hepatocytes in which
triacsin c blocks de novo synthesis of tag 73%, but inhibits
[14c] xxxd2777xxx  incorporation into phospholipid and ce, or metabolism via ␤-oxidation only 30 – 40% (17). in hepg2 cells, triacsin d inhibits  xxxd2777xxx -induced tag synthesis 80% without affecting ce synthesis (18), and in rat primary hepatocytes,
troglitazone at 100 ␮m inhibits [14c] xxxd2777xxx  incorporation into
tag and oxidation products 50% and 20%, respectively,
whereas incorporation into phospholipid remains unaffected
(19). the sulfo-conjugate of troglitazone appeared to be the
likely inhibitory metabolite (19).
these differing effects of acs inhibitors on metabolic end
products of acyl-coa-dependent pathways suggest the presence
of inhibitor-sensitive and -resistant acss that are linked to
specific pathways. if so, acs isoforms might play a critical role
in partitioning acyl-coas toward lipid synthesis versus oxidation. in order to determine whether this hypothesis was correct, we needed to examine the effects of the acs inhibitors on
each of the three acs isoforms expressed in liver and fat cells.
to do this, we expressed  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5 as recombinant acs-flag fusion proteins, and purified each acs by flag
antibody column chromatography.

fig. 2. triton x-100 activates acs5. the activities of purified
 xxxg47xxx -flag (e) and  xxxg49xxx -flag (●) (each 0.1 ␮g) and acs5-flag (f) (1
␮g) isoenzymes were measured in the presence of different concentrations of triton x-100. acs activity at 0.5 mm triton x-100, the concentration regularly used in the assay, represents 100%. activities with 0.5
mm triton x-100 were 1340 for  xxxg47xxx , 2220 for  xxxg49xxx , and 100 nmol/
min/mg for acs5.

triacsin c strongly inhibited  xxxg47xxx  and  xxxg49xxx , but did not
affect acs5—triacsin c, an alkenyl-n-hydroxytriazene fungal
metabolite, was reported to be a potent competitive inhibitor of
acs (22, 23). studies in fibroblasts, hepg2 cells, and rat hepatocytes, however, suggest that triacsin c does not equally inhibit all the pathways in which acyl-coas are used. to test the
effects of triacsin c on the purified acs isoenzymes, triacsin c
was added directly to the reaction mixture (fig. 3). triacsin c
selectively and strongly inhibited  xxxg47xxx  and  xxxg49xxx  in a dosedependent manner, but had little effect on acs5. the ic50 for
 xxxg47xxx  and  xxxg49xxx  was 4 – 6 ␮m.
thiazolidinediones are specific inhibitors of  xxxg49xxx  —thiazolidinediones are oral antidiabetic drugs, generally believed to
act as insulin sensitizers through activation of ppar␥ (24 –26).
because the sulfo-conjugate of troglitazone was reported to
directly inhibit acs activity in both microsomes and mitochondria from rat liver (19), we tested purified recombinant  xxxg47xxx ,
 xxxg49xxx , and acs5 to determine which isoform was inhibited by
thiazolidinediones. troglitazone at 1 ␮m decreased  xxxg49xxx  activity 50%; with 10 ␮m troglitazone, the activity was almost completely blocked (fig. 4a). in contrast,  xxxg47xxx  and acs5 activities
were unaffected by troglitazone  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m. because troglitazone
contains the ring structure of ␣-tocopherol linked to the thiazolidinedione moiety, we determined which part of the molecule was critical for inhibition by testing the effect of ␣-tocopherol itself and of other thiazolidinediones on each of the
purified acs isoenzymes. ␣-tocopherol had little effect on
three acs isoforms (fig. 4b). on the other hand, both pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, which contain the common thiazo-

expression and purification of recombinant acs-flag proteins—recombinant rat  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5 had previously
been purified by column chromatography (10 –12). to obtain
purified acs isoenzymes more efficiently, we designed plasmid
constructs to produce acs proteins with flag epitopes at their
c termini. after induction with iptg, 10% of the acs activity
was found in the soluble fraction. this soluble activity is surprising because  xxxg49xxx  is an integral membrane protein, which
remains associated with rat liver microsomes after washing
with 0.5 m kcl (data not shown). nevertheless, soluble  xxxg49xxx 
(21%) was also obtained when  xxxg49xxx  was overexpressed in
dh5␣ (12).  xxxg47xxx - and acs5-flag were also overexpressed and
identified in the membrane fraction. recombinant acss were
purified to near homogeneity by one-step flag-antibody affinity
chromatography. to ensure that the flag epitope did not alter
acs function, we compared acs activity in membrane fractions from jm109 that overexpressed  xxxg49xxx  or  xxxg49xxx -flag. the
kinetic constants for  xxxd2833xxx , coa, and atp were virtually identical, and the sensitivity to heating at 43 °c was similar, indicating that the flag epitope at the c terminus does not
alter the catalytic properties of acs and supports the use of
acs-flag recombinant proteins for comparative study (data
not shown).
characterization of  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5—to compare
the purified acs isoenzymes, we studied the kinetics of the
three substrates required for acs catalysis. the three acs
isoenzymes had similar apparent km values for coa between
2.4 and 6.4 ␮m and for  xxxd2833xxx  between 5.0 and 8.6 ␮m
(table i).  xxxg49xxx , on the other hand, had an apparent km value
for atp that was almost 20-fold lower than that of  xxxg47xxx  or
acs5 (34 ␮m versus 649 and 666 ␮m). to test sensitivity to
heating, acs isoenzyme activities were measured after heating
at 43 °c for various times (fig. 1).  xxxg47xxx  was most stable to
heat with a half-life of about 10 min whereas  xxxg49xxx  had a t ⁄
shorter than 2 min, and acs5 had a t ⁄ of ⬃4 min. to find the
optimum ph for each acs isoenzyme, mes was used as a
buffer for acs reaction in the range of ph 6 –7, tris for ph 7–9,
and glycine for ph 9 and 9.5.  xxxg47xxx  and  xxxg49xxx  had broad ph
optima between ph 7.4 and 9.0, but the optima for acs5 was
more narrow (ph 7.4 – 8.0) (data not shown). the three purified
acs isoenzymes were differently affected by triton x-100 (fig.
2).  xxxg49xxx  gradually lost activity at triton x-100 concentrations
above 0.5 mm, the concentration normally used for assay,
whereas  xxxg47xxx  maintained maximal activity up to 1.5 mm triton x-100. in contrast, acs5 activity dramatically increased at
triton x-100 concentrations above 0.5 mm, and maintained
maximal activity at 3 mm. acs5 remained highly active even at
10 mm triton x-100 (data not shown).

determinations. activities in the absence of triacsin c were 763 for

lidinedione group but lack the ␣-tocopherol moiety, showed
virtually the same effect as troglitazone on the three acs
isoenzymes.  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m both drugs inhibited  xxxg49xxx  85–95%,
inhibited acs5 less than 20%, and did not alter  xxxg47xxx  activity
(fig. 4, c and d). at concentrations up to 10 ␮m, troglitazone
had little effect on acs5 activity, even after full activation by 3
mm triton x-100 (data not shown). of the thiazolidinediones,
rosiglitazone was the strongest inhibitor of  xxxg49xxx . the ic50 was
0.5 ␮m for rosiglitazone and 1.5 ␮m for troglitazone and pioglitazone (table ii). these data indicate that the thiazolidine-2,4dione moiety is the critical moiety for  xxxg49xxx  inhibition.
troglitazone exhibited a mixed type inhibition of  xxxg49xxx . with
respect to palmitate, the reciprocal plots intersected above the
1/palmitate axis (fig. 5a) and the ki was 0.1 ␮m as calculated
from the km/vmax versus inhibitor replot (fig. 5b). since the 1/v
replot intersected with the km/vmax replot near the y axis, we
can characterize the system as exhibiting linear non-competitive inhibition. linear mixed inhibition also arises when an
inhibitor binds at mutually exclusive sites. therefore, we examined troglitazone inhibition kinetics of coa and atp, the
other two substrates of  xxxg49xxx . troglitazone exhibited partial
uncompetitive inhibition with respect to coa (fig. 5c). for
atp, the reciprocal plots intersected below the 1/palmitate axis

newly identified non-thiazolidinedione ppar␥ activator with a
high affinity for human ppar␥ (27). the glucose-lowering effect of gw1929 in rats is 100-fold more potent than that of
troglitazone (27). in contrast, however, gw1929 was a poor

insulin sensitivity and reduce adiposity (28). we also tested a
variety of xenobiotic carboxylic acids, which contain hydrophobic and carboxylic acid moieties, are known to be incorporated
into complex lipids, and either resemble natural  xxxd2154xxx  or
are aromatic derivatives of short chain  xxxd2154xxx  (29). the

 xxxg49xxx  activities 50% at 25 and 30 – 40 ␮m, respectively, but had
no effect on acs5. other xenobiotic carboxylic acids, 3-phenoxybenzoic acid,  xxxd1756xxx , ibuprofen, ferulic acid, and
firefly luciferin, at concentrations up to 50 ␮m had no effect on

for  xxxg49xxx  catalysis compared with  xxxg47xxx  or acs5 (fig. 5). after
a 10-min preincubation, the arginine-reactive compound, phenylglyoxal, at 25 mm inhibited  xxxg47xxx  38%,  xxxg49xxx  78%, and
acs5 65%, suggesting the importance to each isoform of an
arginine residue for catalysis (data not shown). m-aminophenylboronate (0 –20 mm), a serine-reactive compound, however,
had little effect on  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5 (data not shown).
discussion

we focused on  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5 because these three
isoforms are present in liver, a tissue that metabolizes long
chain  xxxd2154xxx  via a variety of synthetic and degradative
pathways. to characterize  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5 and test the
effects of inhibitors, we purified each acs isoform as a acsflag fusion protein after confirming that the flag sequence at
the c terminus does not alter enzymatic kinetic properties. the
acs5-flag fusion protein was unique with regard to the conditions required for its expression, purification, and full recovery of activity. although others have expressed acs5 without
reported difficulty in dh5␣ with a vector containing the lac
promoter (11), our successful acs5 expression required a vector containing the t7 promoter, suggesting that the acs5
protein may be toxic to e. coli since the t7 promoter-driven
vector suppresses the expression of foreign proteins in uninduced states more completely. in addition, elution of active
acs5-flag from the flag antibody column required the presence of 0.1% triton x-100 in the elution buffer, whereas active
 xxxg47xxx  and  xxxg49xxx  could be eluted without adding detergent.
furthermore, the loss of 50% of acs5 activity, merely in the
process of obtaining bacterial membranes, suggests that detergent might be helpful at every stage of preparation. although
0.5 mm triton x-100 is regularly used in the acs assay, we
found that maximal activation of acs5 demanded an ⬃6-fold
higher concentration of triton x-100. thus, optimal assay conditions required the presence of ⬃500 triton x-100 micelles/
molecule of  xxxg47xxx  or  xxxg49xxx , and about 3000 micelles/molecule of
acs5. the critical micellar concentration of triton x-100 is 0.3
mm, and, although it remains unclear why acs5 requires such
a large number of triton x-100 micelles, the detergent may be
essential to reconstitute or stabilize purified acs5 or to relieve
product inhibition by  xxxd2832xxx -coa. in order to be consistent
in our comparisons, we used identical concentration of triton
x-100 (0.5 mm) and substrates to assay all recombinant acs
isoenzymes.

the three purified acs isoenzymes had similar apparent km
values for coa and  xxxd2833xxx . the apparent km for palmitic
acid of  xxxg49xxx  in this study is more than 10-fold lower than the
one reported previously (12), probably because the concentrations of  xxxd2833xxx  we used to study kinetics ranged from
0.33 to 2.0 of the km, as recommended (30).  xxxg49xxx  had approximately a 20-fold higher affinity for atp than did  xxxg47xxx  or
acs5. if these isoenzymes compete for the same pool of atp,
 xxxg49xxx  might remain active during fasting or when cellular
energy levels are low. on the other hand, however, the subcellular location of  xxxg49xxx  and its increase after refeeding (31)
suggest that acs activities are not simply dependent on substrate availability.
despite their striking homology, the three acs isoforms
exhibited marked differences in their responses to heating and
amino acid-modifying reagents.  xxxg49xxx  was the most sensitive
isoform when heated at 43 °c.  xxxg47xxx  and  xxxg49xxx  had broad ph
optima from ph 7.4 to ph 9.0, whereas the optimum for acs5
was from ph 7.4 to ph 8.0.  xxxg49xxx  was more severely inhibited
by phenylglyoxal than were  xxxg47xxx  or acs5, suggesting that
arginine residues may be more critical for  xxxg49xxx  activity. the
marked inhibition of only  xxxg49xxx  by nem suggests that sulfhydryl group-containing amino acids may also be important. on
the other hand, none of the isoforms was affected by m-aminophenylboronate, indicating that serine is not an essential residue for catalysis. taken as a whole, the responses to sitespecific inhibitors probably reflect the relative similarity of
 xxxg47xxx  and acs5 in amino acid sequence and the relative dissimilarity of  xxxg49xxx .
acs inhibitors such as triacsin c or troglitazone differentially affect metabolic end products of acs-dependent pathways (16 –19). thus, we hypothesized that pathways using
acyl-coa substrates might be initiated by distinct acs isoforms and that the different degree of inhibition of tag, phospholipid, and ce synthesis, or fatty acid ␤-oxidation by acs
inhibitors might result if each acs isoform had a different
sensitivity to the two inhibitors. if this were true, acs isoforms
could play a critical role in partitioning their products toward
specific pathways through independent regulation of each acs
isoform. this hypothesis was supported by our data. the current study using purified acs isoenzymes demonstrates that
acs isoforms can be distinguished by their sensitivity to acs
inhibitors. triacsin c had little effect on acs5, but strongly
inhibited  xxxg47xxx  and  xxxg49xxx  activities in a dose-dependent manner. because studies with cultured cells show that triacsin c
strongly blocks de novo synthesis of tag and has little affect on
phospholipid reacylation or ce synthesis, or on ␤-oxidation
(16 –18),  xxxg47xxx  and  xxxg49xxx  may be closely linked to tag
synthesis.
troglitazone  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m did not alter  xxxg47xxx  activity, mildly
inhibited acs5 activity, and almost completely blocked  xxxg49xxx 
activity. ␣-tocopherol was not an inhibitor, whereas rosiglitazone and pioglitazone were potent  xxxg49xxx -specific inhibitors and
had little affect on  xxxg47xxx  or acs5. thus, the critical component
for  xxxg49xxx  inhibition appears to be the thiazolidine- xxxd309xxx 
moiety rather than the ␣-tocopherol ring. it is most likely that
 xxxg49xxx  inhibition by thiazolidinediones is more closely related to
tag synthesis rather than to ␤-oxidation for several reasons.
1)  xxxg49xxx  protein was most prominently located in the mitochondrial-associated membrane (31), which exhibits the highest
specific activities for enzymes of tag synthesis (32), and was
not detected in mitochondria (31). 2) after a 48-h fast followed
by 24-h refeeding with chow or sucrose (69%), hepatic  xxxg49xxx 
protein increased 150% (31). 3) the preference of  xxxg49xxx  for
arachidonic acids is consistent with only a weak link to ␤-oxidation because  xxxd208xxx  is among the least preferred

inhibition of acyl-coa synthetases 1, 4, and 5

 xxxd2154xxx  for ␤-oxidation during fasting states (33).
thiazolidinediones appear to be highly specific inhibitors of
 xxxg49xxx . troglitazone exhibited mixed-type inhibition of  xxxg49xxx  with
respect to all three substrates. troglitazone is believed to activate
ppar␥ because it mimics a fatty acid; therefore, we postulated
that troglitazone might compete with palmitate in the acyl-coa
ligation reaction. we found that troglitazone displayed linear
mixed-type inhibition (fig. 5a). this could arise because the
 xxxg49xxx -troglitazone complex has a lower affinity than  xxxg49xxx  for
palmitate and the enzyme-substrate(s)-inhibitor complex is nonproductive. another possibility is that troglitazone interacts
at more than one site, so we examined troglitazone inhibition
kinetics of  xxxg49xxx  with coa and atp. troglitazone is a partial
uncompetitive inhibitor of  xxxg49xxx  with respect to coa (fig. 5c),
indicating that the affinity for coa of the  xxxg49xxx -troglitazone
complex increases by the same degree as the inhibitor decreases
vmax. for atp, troglitazone displayed linear mixed-type inhibition with the reciprocal plots intersecting below the 1/palmitate
axis (fig. 5d), suggesting that the  xxxg49xxx -troglitazone complex
has an increased affinity for atp, but that the enzymesubstrate(s)-inhibitor complex forms product more slowly than
the enzyme-substrate(s) complex. it should be noted that these
types of inhibition kinetic systems were initially characterized
using soluble single substrate enzymes (30), whereas we are
extrapolating them to apply to a membrane-bound enzyme,
 xxxg49xxx , that has three substrates, only two of which are soluble.

fig. 6.  xxxd2684xxx  inhibits  xxxg49xxx . the reaction was initiated by adding  xxxg47xxx -flag (e),  xxxg49xxx -flag (●) (each 0.1 ␮g), and acs5flag (f) (1 ␮g) that had been incubated with different concentrations of
nem for 10 min on ice. the proteins were preincubated with nem
dissolved in 10 mm tris, and 0.5 mm edta (ph 7.4) buffer. the values
are from an experiment that is representative of two independent
determinations. uninhibited activities were 1159 for  xxxg47xxx , 2477 for
 xxxg49xxx , and 113 nmol/min/mg for acs5.

gw1929, a potent non-thiazolidinedione ppar␥ activator,
was a weak inhibitor of both  xxxg47xxx  and  xxxg49xxx , with an ic50
value for  xxxg49xxx  more than 30-fold higher than that observed
with thiazolidinediones.  xxxg49xxx  was not affected by the ppar␣
activators clofibric acid and gw4647 at concentrations up to 50

␮m, even though these compounds, like the thiazolidinediones,
can markedly lower hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia in
diabetic animal models (28). furthermore,  xxxg49xxx  was unaffected by a variety of xenobiotic carboxylic acids that contain
hydrophobic rings and are known to be incorporated into complex lipids.
although we did not test the effects of troglitazone o-sulfate
(tos), a major troglitazone metabolite, 100 ␮m tos was reported to inhibit acs activity 80% in both microsomes and
mitochondria from rat hepatocytes, whereas troglitazone itself
had no effect (19). the purity of the membrane fractions used in
the reported study was not evaluated. we found that troglitazone  xxxd1891xxx  and 50 ␮m inhibited acs activity 25% and 50%,
respectively, in purified mitochondria-associated membrane
fractions (31). the reported poor ability of troglitazone to inhibit acs activity (19) probably occurred because the membrane fractions used in that study contained relatively little
 xxxg49xxx , but may have contained other acs isoforms that were
sensitive to high concentrations of tos or to an inhibitory
factor elicited by tos.
thiazolidinediones are powerful oral antidiabetic drugs that
act as insulin sensitizers. although it is believed that their
efficacy occurs via activation of ppar␥ (24 –26), some evidence
suggests that some thiazolidinedione actions can occur in a
ppar␥-independent manner. in ppar␥-deficient heterozygous
mice, for example, glucose disposal rate and suppression of
hepatic glucose production are greater than in normal mice, the
reverse of what one would expect if thiazolidinediones ameliorate insulin resistance by activating ppar␥ (34). further,
some compounds exhibit potent antidiabetic effects despite
their weak activation of ppar␥ (35). troglitazone and rosiglitazone decrease serum triacylglycerol even in ap2/dta mice,
which lack adipose deposits, a main site for ppar␥ action
(36 –38); troglitazone has acute effects in rats both on glucose
disposal and on hepatic glucose production (39); finally, tzds
can decrease the expression of  xxxg2296xxx -␣ and
interleukin-6 in macrophages that contain no ppar␥ (40). our
results suggest that  xxxg49xxx  could contribute to the insulinsensitizing and anti-inflammatory effects of the thiazolidinediones through direct interaction with  xxxg49xxx  in a ppar␥independent manner.
