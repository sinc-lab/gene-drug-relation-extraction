and adenylate cyclase in amygdala, europ. j. pharmacol. 72 (1981) 343--349.
the activity of  xxxd2588xxx  and two major metabolites of this drug, noracetylmethadol and dinoracetylmethadol were studied in m o n k e y brain amygdaloid tissue. this tissue contains opiate receptors which may be
assessed by direct binding studies; also these receptors are coupled to and capable of modulating a dopaminestimulated adenylate cyclase system.  xxxd2070xxx  and d-ala2- xxxg1801xxx  exhibited similar potencies when
assessed for inhibition of dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase or competition for [3h]d-ala2- xxxg1801xxx 
binding sites. while  xxxd2588xxx  displaced [3h]d-ala2- xxxg1801xxx  binding sites with a k i of 7.4 × 10 -7 m,
it had no detectable activity in the opiate receptor coupled adenylate cyclase system. noracetylmethadol and
dinoracetylmethadol, however, were capable of both binding (k i values, 5.6 and 1140 nm respectively) as well
as inhibiting the dopamine stimulated adenylate cyclase system (ics0 values, 1.2 and 800 nm respectively). thus,
it appears that metabolism of  xxxd2588xxx  to its mono-demethylated form results in a compound more active
in both assay systems. the further demethylation of noracetylmethadol results in a second, but less potent,
active metabolite. this process of biological activation can be assumed to account for the slow onset and long
duration of action of  xxxd2588xxx .
1-~- xxxd2588xxx  (laam)

opiate receptors

1. introduction
 xxxd2588xxx 
(1-a- xxxd2588xxx ,
laam) has been shown to be an effective
substitute for methadone in the treatment of
heroin addiction (jaffe and senay, 1971;
jaffe et al., 1970; jaffe et al., 1972; senay,
1973) and has been introduced into clinical
trial for this purpose (jaffe et al., 1972;
senay, 1973; goldstein, 1976; wilson et al.,
1976). the slow onset and prolonged action
of this c o m p o u n d has been attributed to its
biotransformation into active metabolites
(sung and way, 1954; billings et al., 1974a,
1974b; kochhar et al., 1977). acethylmethadol, methadol, normethadol, noracetylmethadol (l~-noracetylmethadol n-laam), and
dinoracetylmethadol (1-~-dinoracetylmetha-

dol, dn-laam) have all been identified in
plasma and urine of laboratory animals given
the parent compound as well as human
patients treated with  xxxd2588xxx  (billings
et al., 1973; kaiko and inturrisi, 1973;
billings et al., 1974a,b).
a number of studies have shown laam to
possess significant analgesic potency (chen,
1948; smith and lehman, 1953; leimbach
and eddy, 1954). analgesic activity has also
been demonstrated for several laam metabolites (nichander et al., 1973; smits, 1974;
billings et al., 1973). with regard to addictive
capacity, laam (moreton et al., 1974) as
well as n-laam (archer, 1976) possess significantly high physical dependence liability
and addictive potential. it becomes apparent,
therefore, in terms of general neuro- and

psychopharmacological effects, that laam
and its active metabolites produce rather
classical opioid effects, characterized, for the
parent c o m p o u n d , by delayed onset and prolonged duration of action. while it is generally
assumed that laam produces its narcotic
effects via the direct interaction of active
metabolites with opiate receptors, there is
little specific information available concerning
the biochemical mechanisms for the opiate
effects and addictive properties of laam. in
view of these considerations we have undertaken a biochemical investigation of laam
and the two major metabolites, n-laam and
dn-laam in order to evaluate their action at
the molecular level. these studies have been
carried out with m o n k e y brain amygdaloid
tissue, which contains opiate receptors
coupled to and capable of modulating a
dopamine-stimulated
adenylate
cyclase
system.

2. materials and methods

2.1. animals
animals used were wild .macaca mulatta
(rhesus) or cebus apella monkeys. they
ranged in age from 2 to 7 years and both
sexes were used. it was found in the present
study, as well as in our previous reports
(wilkening et al., 1976; walczak et al., 1979)
that essentially similar results were obtained
with either species. monkeys were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50-70 mg/kg i.v.),
the cranial vault and dura were removed, the
cerebral blood flow was interrupted and the
brain was excised and rinsed with saline (410°c). the amygdaloid nuclear complex was
d i s s e c t e d o u t bilaterally and wet weight was
determined.

2.2. adenylate cyclase assay and  xxxd1773xxx 
determination
these procedures were performed as
described previously (walczak et al., 1979)

s.a. w a l c z a k et al.

with the following modifications of the protein binding method utilized for determination of  xxxd1773xxx  formed during the adenylate cyclase assay. the binding assay incubation was terminated by addition of 3.8 m
ammonium sulfate rather than tris-maleate
buffer. precipitation of protein was allowed
to proceed for 2 min after which each sample
was filtered on whatman gfc filters rather
than millipore discs.

2.3. tissue preparation for receptor binding
studies
the excised amygdaloid tissue was placed
in 10 vols of sodium free tris-hc1 buffer
(50 nm, ph 7.4, 4 ° c ) a n d was homogenized
utilizing a polytron for 1 min at a probe setting
of 5. the probe was then rinsed with 20 vols
of cold tris-hc1 buffer, both samples were
combined and centrifuged at 30 000 g for 15
min. the supernatant was discarded, and the
pellet was resuspended in 30 vols of cold trishc1 buffer by vortexing vigorously for 30 sec.
the sample was then centrifuged and resuspended as above with 100 vols of tris-hc1
buffer and then incubated with a shaking
water bath at 37°c for 30 min. the samples
were again centrifuged as above, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended (polytron probe setting of 4 for 20
sec) in 100 vols of tris-hc1 buffer. aliquots
of resuspended tissue fraction were then used
for the opiate binding assays and also for protein determinations (lowry et al., 1951).

2.4. opiate receptor binding assays
for studies involving scatchard analysis;
1 ml aliquots of the crude membrane preparation were first incubated for 5 min at 27°c
with either dextrorphan or levorphanol
(1 pm). various concentrations of [3h]dala2- xxxg1801xxx  (concentrations ranged
from 0.5 to 60 nm) were then added to the
assay tubes and were allowed to incubate
with shaking for 20 min  xxxd1891xxx °c. triplicate
determinations were carried o u t for each con-

s.a. w a l c z a k et al.

the testing of  xxxd2070xxx  at higher concentrations than previously used, a bell shaped dose
response curve emerges for this drug as well as
for the enkephalins. the inhibition of the dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase by all of
these opiates can be reversed by naloxone.

nylate cyclase by 10 tzm dopamine was inhibited by morphine,  xxxd2070xxx  and d-ala2-met enkephalin with ics0 s of 7 x 10 -6 m, 7.5 x
10 -l° m, and 3 × 10 -9 m respectively {table
1, fig. 1), also in agreement with our previous
findings. while laam itself did not affect
either basal or dopamine stimulated adenylate
cyclase (fig. 1b), dn-laam behaved in a
manner similar to that of morphine, inhibiting
the dopamine~timulated adenylate cyclase at
relatively high concentrations (ics0, 8 x 10 -7
m). n-laam (fig. 1a) the biologically more
potent of the t w o metabolites tested, had a
p o t e n c y (ics0, 1.1 x 10 -9 m) and behaved in
a manner similar to that of d-ala2-met enkephalin. thus, n-laam was considerably
more p o t e n t in the adenylate cyclase system
than either laam or dn-laam, and also
exhibited the same bell shaped dose-response
curve which we reported for the enkephalins
(walczak et al., 1979). as was the case for
morphine and the enkephalins (walczak et al.,
1979), the laam metabolites did n o t inhibit
the basal adenylate cyclase activity. while we
previously reported a dose response curve for
 xxxd2070xxx  similar in shape to that of morphine
(walczak et al., 1979), we now find that with

3.2. opiate receptor binding
the binding characteristics of d-ala2-met enkephalin in the m o n k e y amygdala were
similar to those found for this ligand (zukin
et al., 1980; gardner et al., 1980) as well as
other opioid peptides (lord et al., 1977;
miller et al., 1978; simantov et al., 1978) in
rat and guinea pig brain. thus, m o n k e y
amygdaia contained saturable, stereospecific
sites (fig. 2a), including both a high affinity
binding site ( k d 3.8 x 1 0 -9 m) as well as a
lower affinity site {k d l a x 10 -s m) (fig.
2b). utilizing 3h-d-ala2- xxxg1801xxx  as
the radiolabeled ligand at a concentration of
5 nm, a series of displacement curves were
obtained as depicted in fig. 3. the ki values
for the c o m p o u n d s tested are listed in table 1.
from these values, it is apparent that
n-laam {k i 5.6 × 1 0 -9 m ) binds with a higher

precursor laam (ki 7.4x 10 -tm) or its
demethylated metabolite dn-laam (ki 1.4 x
10 -6 m).

4. discussion
based on the data reported using the
m o n k e y amygdala adenylate cyclase system,
it appears that the metabolites (n-laam,
dn-laam) rather than the parent c o m p o u n d
(laam) possess significant activity as opioid
agonists. apparently the metabolism of
laam to its demethylated form is responsible for the observed activation of this
opiate.
the
further
demethylation
of
n-laam to dn-laam results in a second,
albeit less potent, active metabolite. it might
be assumed that it is this process of.activation
which accounts for the slow onset and long
duration of action of laam.
the present report represents the first
direct comparison of the potencies of opioid
c o m p o u n d s with regard to binding sites and
receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase in brain

tissue. when comparing the ics0 s in the
cyclase system to the ki s obtained in the
binding studies, there is an overall agreement
with the more p o t e n t c o m p o u n d s  xxxd2070xxx ,
d-ala2- xxxg1801xxx , n-laam- and dnlaam. thus,  xxxd2070xxx  is most potent, dnlaam by far the weakest and the other two
compounds intermediate in both cyclase and
binding systems. however, the ratio of activities in the t w o systems for each of these compounds is not constant. furthermore, the
cyclase and direct binding studies are n o t in
agreement with respect to the potencies of
morphine and laam. this discrepancy might
be due to the fact that the experiments
involving adenylate cyclase are carried out in
a different buffer system than the binding
studies. the presence of theophylline,  xxxd2534xxx ,
egta or na2atp in the cyclase system could
then affect the relative potencies of the compounds tested. in fact, preliminary studies in
our laboratory have shown that the affinity
of morphine for [3h]d-ala2-met*enkephalin
binding sites is markedly reduced in the
presence of the cyclase reaction mixture
whereas that of  xxxd2070xxx  and n-laam is

348

not changed (walczak, gardner and makman,
unpublished observations). on the other
hand, a major factor influencing the difference in potency in the two systems, particularly in the case of laam itself, is that mere
receptor occupancy does not necessarily
confer biological activity. an additional and
perhaps major factor is the possible presence
of multiple receptor subtypes for opiates
(martin et al., 1976; lord et ~., 1977) in the
amygdala. thus, the adenylate cyclase system
may in fact not involve the major component
assessed by radioligand binding in these
studies. it may also be pointed out that while
much information can be obtained from
receptor binding studies, such studies do not
directly distinguish agonists and antagonists
(aside from the differential effects of sodium
and gtp) nor do they assess the effective
coupling of the receptor to the next process
involved. in these respects the monkey
amygdala adenylate cyclase system may
present a useful model for determining functionally significant interaction of opiates at a
molecular level.
