abstract
the pharmacological characteristics of w3 hxdofetilide binding in shsy5y, hek293 and cho-k1 cells were examined, and in parallel
whole cell recordings used to characterise herg-like kq currents. dofetilide affinity was similar in the human cell lines, shsy5y
ž k d s 99.6 nm. and hek293 ž k d s 102.9 nm., but 10 times lower in cho-k1 cells ž k d s 1200 nm.. in contrast, clofilium and e4031
had a similar affinity in all three cell lines, whereas way 123,398 had no effect. electrophysiological studies showed that shsy5y cells
contained a herg-like kq current blocked by application of dofetilide to either side of the membrane. block was faster when dofetilide
was applied intracellularly. in contrast, hek293 and cho-k1 cells contained no such current, despite the presence of a partial cdna for
herg in the former. that w3 hxdofetilide is specific for i krrherg may be questionable, as hek293 and cho-k1 cells contain no such
functional kq current. q 2001 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
a combination of molecular biological and electrophysiological studies have enhanced our understanding of the
roles and potential applications of kq channels as putative
pharmacological targets žjan and jan, 1997; sanguinetti
and spector, 1997.. the kq channel encoded by the
human ether-a-gogo-related gene žherg. žwarmke and
ganetzky, 1994. has received a considerable amount of
attention. heterologous expression of herg in a number
of systems including xenopus oocytes and human cell
lines has demonstrated that this gene encodes for a kq
selective channel žsnyders and chaudhary, 1996; spector
et al., 1996.. as with other members of the voltage-gated
kq channel family, the protein encoded by this gene is
predicted to have six transmembrane spanning regions,
cytoplasmic n and c termini and a pore forming region
between the transmembrane segments s5 and s6 žjan and
jan, 1997.. the main properties of the channel include

activation upon depolarisation, small outward currents due
to rapid inactivation, which is relieved on hyperpolarisation to exhibit inward rectification, dependence upon extracellular kq for maximal conductance and sensitivity to
class iii antiarrythmics žbianchi et al., 1998.. this current
known as i kr is fundamental to cardiac physiology and
mutations in herg have already been shown to be responsible for chromosome seven linked long qt syndrome
žschonherr et al., 1999.. the herg kq channel may also
be responsible for the deleterious cardiotoxic side effects
that have been associated with the second generation antihistamines and other drugs žkiehn et al., 1995..
in addition to a key role in the physiology of the heart,
it is apparent that herg kq channels are located in other
tissues. the cdna encoding for the channel was first
identified from a human hippocampal cdna library
žwarmke and ganetzky, 1994. and herg kq channels
have subsequently been shown to be present in brain,
adrenals, thymus and retina žwymore et al., 1997.. in the
human cell line shsy5y, and in other neuroblastomas, it
is postulated that herg kq channels may be involved in
setting resting membrane potential žarcangeli et al., 1995.,

spike frequency adaptation žchiesa et al., 1997; schonherr
et al., 1999.. the identification of mammalian cells lines
of neuronal lineage such as shsy5y, sk-nbe and f11,
which constitutively express herg-like kq channels
žarcangeli et al., 1995; faravelli et al., 1996; bianchi et
al., 1998; meyer and heinemann, 1998., provides an excellent model in which to investigate the biophysical and
pharmacological properties of these channels. the characteristic sensitivity of this channel in cardiac tissue to class
iii antiarrythmics provides a group of compounds with
which to characterise the properties of this channel in other
tissues. one such compound, dofetilide žuk-68,798. has
been radiolabelled and has been used to examine the
pharmacology of w3 hxdofetilide binding sites žchadwick et
al., 1993; lynch et al., 1995; duff et al., 1995, 1997a,b;
fiset et al., 1996; geonzon et al., 1998..
this paper describes the characterisation of w3 hxdofetilide binding sites in the human neuroblastoma cell line
shsy5y, the human kidney cell line hek293 and the
hamster cell line cho-k1 and the electrophysiological
identification of herg-like kq currents in these cell
lines.

2. materials and methods
2.1. cell culture
shsy5y cells žpassage 9–20. were routinely maintained in culture in dmem supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum žfcs., 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin ž100
mgrml. and streptomycin ž100 mgrml. and incubated at
378c in a humidified atmosphere with 5% co 2 . hek293
žpassage 50–70. and cho-k1 žpassage 19–35. cells were
maintained as above in mem žplus fcs, glutamine and
non-essential amino acids. and ham’s f12 žplus fcs and
glutamine., respectively.
2.2. [3h]dofetilide binding assay
w3 hxdofetilide binding in cell lines was assessed in a
physiological sodium buffer by a modification of previous
methods žduff et al., 1995, 1997a; fiset et al., 1996.. cells
were rinsed twice in the sodium incubation buffer žkept at
378c. žmm: hepes, 10; nacl, 130; kcl, 5; mgcl 2 , 0.8;
naegta, 1; glucose, 10; and 0.1% bsa, ph 7.4. and
gently scraped from flasks or petri dishes, transferred to 50
ml falcon tubes and centrifuged at 1000 = g for 10 min.
cells were resuspended in 1 ml of sodium incubation
buffer and left at 378c for 30 min prior to counting.
binding assays žsee below. were carried out with approximately 10 6 cells per tube; protein content was determined
as described previously žfinlayson et al., 1997.. assay
buffer or test drug ž30 ml. was incubated with 20 ml of

w3 hxdofetilide žfinal concentration 10 nm. and 150 ml of
cells. the incubation time was 60 min; preliminary experiments confirmed that binding was at equilibrium under
these conditions for all three cell lines ždata not shown..
the binding assay was terminated by filtration onto glass
filters žgfrc pre-soaked in wash buffer containing 1%
bsa. by use of a brandel cell harvester, followed by
three washes ž2 ml. with tris–hcl wash buffer žmm:
tris–hcl, 25; nacl, 130; kcl, 5.5; mgcl 2 , 0.8; glucose,
5;  xxxg2125xxx  2 , 0.05; and 0.01% bsa, ph 7.4.. filter disks were
transferred to scintillation vials, allowed to dry prior to the
addition of 4 ml of emulsifier safe scintillation fluid and
radioactivity determined by scintillation counting. for assays without bsa, the procedure was performed exactly as
described above, with gfrc filters soaked in 0.25%
polyethylenimine žpei..
2.3. electrophysiology
patch-clamp recordings were made at room temperature, using an axopatch 200 amplifier. all recordings were
in the whole-cell mode, using unsylgarded, fire-polished
pipettes žgarner glass type 7052. and data recorded directly to a computer using pclamp6. the high potassium
extracellular solution used in the bath during recordings,
contained žmm.: nacl, 93; kcl, 40;  xxxg2125xxx  2 , 2; mgcl 2 , 2;
hepes, 10; glucose, 5; ph 7.4 with naoh. the pipette
solution contained žmm.: potassium aspartate, 130; nacl,
10;  xxxg2125xxx  2 , 4; mgcl 2 , 2; egta, 10; hepes, 10; ph 7.3
with koh. undifferentiated cells were maintained in culture as described above and used 1–3 days after plating at
a density of 250,000 cells per dish ž35 mm.. petri dishes
were changed every hour and recordings were made in
static solutions. dofetilide was diluted in high potassium
solution and added directly to the bath žfinal concentration
200 nm., or diluted in pipette solution and added to the
patch pipette. the herg inward tail currents were recorded
by stepping the voltage to a negative potential from a
holding potential of 0 mv. the high potassium extracellular solution maximizes the size of the inward currents
when present. at 0 mv, the herg channels open and
inactivate, and the currents subsequently seen at negative
potentials are the result of the removal of inactivation. the
data was obtained using four different voltage protocols.
protocol 1: used to obtain irv relationships: 13 voltage
steps were applied, at 20-mv intervals, between 80 and
y160 mv; steps were 5 s apart, 200 ms in duration and
were applied from holding potentials of 0, y40 or y80
mv. protocol 2: cells were held at 0 mv and stepped to
y130 mv for 200 ms; this was repeated every 2 min to
obtain a number of control recordings or to follow the
effect of a drug application. protocol 3: cells were held at
y60 mv and stepped to 0 mv for 2 s, then to y130 mv
for 200 ms, followed by returning to 0 mv for 60 ms and
finally back to y60 mv. protocol 4: nine voltage steps

k. finlayson et al.r european journal of pharmacology 412 (2001) 203–212

were applied ž20 s apart., each of which contained a 2-s
prepulse, followed by a 200 ms step to y130 mv, then
returning to the prepulse level for 60 ms and finally back
to the holding potential of y60 mv. the prepulses went
up from y60 to 100 mv in 20-mv intervals. data were
analysed using the pclamp6 software, and the statistics
quoted are for paired t-tests.
2.4. reõerse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rtpcr)
total rna was isolated from shsy5y and hek293
cells žrneasy, qiagen, crawley, uk. and first strand
cdna synthesis performed using 5 mg of total rna, as
per manufacturer’s instructions žamersham pharmacia
biotech, bucks, uk.. the following sense and antisense
primers directed against the herg sequence žaccession
number u04270. were used: sense1; 5x-tccagcggctgtactcgggc-3x and antisense; 5x-tggaccagaagtggtcggagaactc-3x žnucleotides 2171–
2190 and 2722–2746, respectively; arcangeli et al., 1998.;
sense2: 5x-ggctccatcgagatcgagatcctgcggggc-3x žnucleotides 2530–2559; bianchi et al., 1998..
the first round of pcr was performed using 2 ml of first
strand reaction žtotal volume 15 ml. and the sense1 and
antisense primers ž0.5 mm final concentrations., by a
modification of a previous method žarcangeli et al., 1998..
briefly, the pcr conditions were as follows: 10 min at
958c for 1 cycle, 1.5 min at 958c, 3 min at 508c and 1.5
min at 728c for 43 cycles. five microliters of the first pcr
reaction was then used as a template for a subsequent pcr
reaction using the sense2 žnested primer. and antisense
primer. the pcr conditions for the subsequent reaction
were as follows: 948c for 5 min ž1 cycle., 948c for 30 s,
608c for 1 min and 728c for 1 min for 40 cycles, followed
by 7 min at 728c. pcr products were visualized on a 2%
agarose gel and bands of the calculated molecular weight
were extracted from the gel žqiagen., verified by restriction digest, subcloned into the pcrii vector žta cloning;

2.5. data analysis
for w3 hxdofetilide binding studies, data were analysed
using an iterative, non-linear least square curve fitting

the absence of inhibitor and non-specific binding, respectively. estimates of m and b were within 10% of experimentally determined values. if the inhibitor was the unlabelled form of the radioligand, the binding site affinity, k d
and the binding site density, bmax were calculated using
the equations: k d s ic 50 y w3 hxligand and bmax s ž m p

3.1. characterisation of [3h]dofetilide binding sites
the affinity of dofetilide, using the method of duff et
al. ž1995., which included high levels of bsa in the
incubation, wash and filter soaking buffers to maximise
specific binding, is similar in the human cell lines,
shsy5y ž k d s 99.6 " 31.9 nm; n s 5. and hek293 ž k d

that in previous w3 hxdofetilide binding and electrophysiological studies for i kr žduff et al., 1995, 1997a; fiset et
al., 1996.. the hill coefficients for all the class iii antiarrythmic compounds in each of the three cell lines were
close to unity, indicating the presence of a single affinity
state or multiple states of equal affinity. surprisingly,
way 123,398, another well characterised class iii antiarrythmic, had no effect on w3 hxdofetilide binding in any of
the three cell lines.
3.2. effect of altering the assay conditions
in previous w3 hxdofetilide binding studies žchadwick et
al., 1993; lynch et al., 1995; duff et al., 1995., assay
buffers contained high levels of bsa in an attempt to
maximise the level of specific binding. however, these
concentrations of bsa can considerably reduce the speed
of filtration and could result in the loss of a low affinitybinding component. in an attempt to address this point, all
the bsa was removed from the incubation, filtration and
filter soaking buffers; the ionic composition of the incubation and wash buffers were unaltered and gfrc filters
were soaked in 0.25% pei.
removal of bsa from the assay resulted in no alteration in the level of specific binding for any of the three
cell lines ž50–60% for shsy5y, 75–85% for hek293

3.3. whole-cell electrophysiology
whole-cell recordings from undifferentiated shsy5y
cells identified an endogenous herg-like kq current
žfig. 2a; n s 7., similar to that described in previous
reports žarcangeli et al., 1995; faravelli et al., 1996..
when the cell is stepped to negative potentials after holding at 0 mv, the herg current is seen as a large inward
tail current žfig. 2a.; however, no herg current is seen
when the cell is held at y40 mv žfig. 2b.. the current
illustrated in fig. 2a was identified as herg on the basis
of its appearance and kinetics žarcangeli et al., 1995;
faravelli et al., 1996. and because it was blocked by 0.5

nm. to the bathing solution. dofetilide completely blocked
the herg current, leaving only a small plateau current
žfig. 2d. and caused a significant reduction in peak current žcontrols y737" 107 pa; after dofetilides y163
" 43 pa, mean " sem ž n s 3.; p - 0.05.. dofetilide did
not block the current immediately on application to the
bath, with the full effect occurring 11, 13 and 21 min after
application and the data quoted aafter dofetilideb are for
these time points, when the effect was maximal in each
cell.
application of dofetilide ž200 nm. via the patch pipette
to the inside of the cell demonstrated that block was faster
when the drug was applied in this manner and was dependent on the holding potential. in one group of shsy5y
cells, 0 mv was applied to the patch pipette before, during
and after the establishment of whole-cell recording configuration. protocol 2 was applied and these cells showed no
peak in their inward current, i.e. no herg currents ž n s 3.;
dofetilide blocks herg current immediately when applied
to the inside of the cell and when herg channels have
been opened by holding the cell at 0 mv.
in a second group of shsy5y cells, y50 mv was
applied to the patch pipette before and during the establishment of the whole-cell recording configuration and cells
were subsequently held at y60 mv. protocol 3 žincluding
a prepulse to 0 mv. was used to show herg currents
were unimpaired under these conditions in the presence of
200 nm dofetilide žpeak currents y750 " 286 pa, mean
" sem, n s 3.. however, these currents were blocked as
soon as the holding potential was changed to 0 mv žon
changing to 0 mv currents y214" 41 pa, mean " sem,
n s 3, currents recorded using protocol 2.. these results
confirm that dofetilide cannot block herg channels while
they are held closed at y60 mv. in addition, the channels
only become susceptible to block by dofetilide when held
at 0 mv for longer than 2 s; the 2 s prepulse to 0 mv in
protocol 3 was not long enough for block to develop.
recordings were made from hek293 ž n s 5. and
cho-k1 ž n s 2. cells using the conditions described for
shsy5y cells. irv plots from holding potentials of 0,
y40 and y80 mv were recorded for both cell types and
the absence of a herg-like kq current demonstrated.
this can be seen clearly when comparing the herg
current recorded from shsy5y cells žfig. 2a. with that of
hek293 and cho-k1 cells žfig. 3a and b. at a holding
potential 0 mv.
in hek293 cells ž n s 3., recordings were made using
protocol 4, before and after application of dofetilide ž200
nm. to the bathing solution. the outward currents were
measured at their minimum and maximum and results
demonstrate that the current present in these cells was not
significantly affected by dofetilide žfig. 4.. for voltage
steps with a 2-s prepulse to 100 mv, the minimum control
outward current was 253 " 102 pa, and 37 min after
dofetilide application, the current was 278 " 107 pa ž n s

fig. 3. families of currents in ža. hek293 and žb. cho-k1 cells were
recorded from a holding potential of 0 mv using protocol 1. ža. in
hek293 cells, there was no herg-like kq current; however, there was

exhibited very little current of any kind.

3.4. amplification of a herg channel partial cdna by
rt-pcr
as no functional evidence could be provided for the
presence of a herg-like kq channel in hek293 cells,
despite similar w3 hxdofetilide binding data to the other
human cell line, shsy5y, which is known to express
herg žbianchi et al., 1998., we examined herg channel
expression using rt-pcr. primers that have been used
previously to show the existence of herg transcripts in
shsy5y cells žarcangeli et al., 1998; bianchi et al.,
1998. were used to examine the presence of herg in both
shsy5y and hek293 cells. as the sense1 and antisense

primers žarcangeli et al., 1998. can produce bands of
multiple sizes when aligned against the herg sequence,
this pcr reaction was used as a template for a second
pcr reaction using a nested primer žsense2., in conjunction with the antisense primer, to confirm specificity. on
an agarose gel, the size of the fragment was as expected
ž217 bp. in both hek293 and shsy5y cells žfig. 5, lanes
4 and 5, respectively.. in addition, digestion of these pcr
products by apa1, resulted in bands of the predicted
molecular weights žfig. 5, lanes 2 and 3, respectively..

in this report we describe for the first time, to our
knowledge, the characterisation of w3 hxdofetilide binding
to the two human cell lines shsy5y and hek293. the
affinity of dofetilide ž; 100 nm. in the neuroblastoma cell
line shsy5y and in the embryonic kidney cell line
hek293 was almost identical and an order of magnitude
higher than that observed in the hamster cell line cho-k1.
in contrast, the class iii antiarrythmics clofilium and e4031
had a similar affinity in all three cell lines, whereas way
123,398 had no effect on w3 hxdofetilide binding. removal
of bsa from the assay had no discernible effect on the
level of specific binding or on the affinity of the different
compounds in any of the three cell lines. electrophysiological studies identified the presence of a herg-like kq
current in shsy5y cells, which is in good agreement with
previous studies žarcangeli et al., 1995, 1998; faravelli et
al., 1996; rosati et al., 1998.. however, no such current
was identifiable in hek293 or cho-k1 cells, despite the
similarity in binding data for hek293 cells and the identification of a partial herg channel cdna.
previously, it has been demonstrated that w3 hxdofetilide
binds to i kr , i.e. herg in both cardiac myocytes and
ventricular homogenate from different species žchadwick
et al., 1993; lynch et al., 1995; duff et al., 1995.. in the
present study, we have examined the pharmacology of
w3 hxdofetilide binding sites in the human neuroblastoma
cell line shsy5y from which a cdna encoding for
herg has been identified žbianchi et al., 1998. and which

210

k. finlayson et al.r european journal of pharmacology 412 (2001) 203–212

is well characterised electrophysiologically žarcangeli et
al., 1995, 1998; faravelli et al., 1996; rosati et al., 1998..
in shsy5y cells, the affinity of dofetilide ž; 100 nm. in
the absence or presence of bsa is in good agreement with
that of chadwick et al. ž1993. žic 50 s 100 " 30 nm. who
originally characterised w3 hxdofetilide binding in guinea
pig cardiac myocytes. in contrast to studies in myocytes
žduff et al., 1995, 1997a; lynch et al., 1995; fiset et al.,
1996., hill slopes for all compounds were near unity,
providing no evidence for more than one affinity site
žtable 1.. the removal of bsa from the assay resulted in
a dramatic increase in the speed of filtration but produced
no evidence for an additional low affinity site. however,
the affinities of dofetilide, clofilium and e4031 in shsy5y
cells are, in general, close to the high affinity values
reported for each compound in cardiac myocytes and are
in excellent agreement with the results of these authors
when the data is fitted to a one-site model žduff et al.,
1995, 1997a; lynch et al., 1995; fiset et al., 1996..
dofetilide has been reported to be an open channel
blocker of i krrherg at nanomolar concentrations
žsnyders and chaudhary, 1996; ficker et al., 1998.. our
results confirm that in shsy5y cells dofetilide is unable
to block herg when the channels are closed. dofetilide
block is more rapid when the drug is added intracellularly,
confirming earlier suggestions that dofetilide may access
its binding site from inside the cell membrane žkiehn et
al., 1996; zou et al., 1997; ficker et al., 1998; pennington
et al., 2000.. our finding that channels need to be held at 0
mv for longer than 2 s before they are susceptible to block
by dofetilide suggests something more has to happen to the
channel than simply opening before it can be blocked. it is
possible that the channels need to be in the inactivated
state before dofetilide can bind, as for rp58866 žwang et
al., 1999., or that allosteric changes occur during inactivation žlees-miller et al., 2000..
unlike shsy5y cells, we found no evidence for the
presence of a herg-like kq current in hek293 cells,
although they do contain a small outward current identified
by other authors žsnyders and chaudhary, 1996; zhou et
al., 1998.. in addition, anti-herg antibodies provided no
evidence for the presence of herg in untransfected
hek293 cells žzhou et al., 1998.. we were therefore
somewhat surprised to find w3 hxdofetilide binding in
hek293 cells with pharmacological characteristics similar
to that described above for shsy5y cells žtable 1.. as in
shsy5y cells, hill slopes for dofetilide, clofilium, e4031
and, in addition, d-sotalol were close to unity. the density
of binding sites was higher ž; 4-fold. and the level of
specific binding greater in hek293 cells than in shsy5y
cells. so, if there is no functional or biochemical evidence
for the existence of herg in hek293 cells, what is
dofetilide binding to? although dofetilide was initially
thought to be a selective blocker of i kr žchadwick et al.,
1993., studies indicate that dofetilide and other class iii
antiarrythmics have affinities for a variety of potassium

channels, including the human inward rectifier žhirk.,
small-conductance ca2q-activated channels žsk ca ., the
muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-operated channel
žik ach . and ether-a-gogo-related channels žeag. žmclarnon and wang, 1991; mori et al., 1995; kiehn et al.,
1995; geonzon et al., 1998; lees-miller et al., 2000..
these data indicate that dofetilide could bind to a different
kq channel in hek293 cells; however, the small outward
current identified in the present study was not blocked by
dofetilide. it is therefore possible that w3 hxdofetilide binds
to a non-functional channel protein or subunit. indeed, in
the present study, limited rt-pcr studies identified the
existence of a partial cdna encoding for herg in both
shsy5y and hek293 cells. further sequencing would be
required to determine if hek293 cells contained the full
sequence previously identified in shsy5y cells žbianchi
et al., 1998.. in addition, rat cardiac myocytes, which are
like hek293 and cho-k1 cells in being devoid of i kr ,
have an affinity for dofetilide of 290 nm žduff et al.,
1995.. this value lies between the high affinity site for
dofetilide ž28 nm. in guinea pig myocytes žputatively i kr .
and the low affinity site ž1.63 mm. that supposedly does
not reflect binding to i kr . also, in a recent study the same
authors žgeonzon et al., 1998. demonstrate high affinity
binding for w3 hxdofetilide in human leukocytes. interestingly, there is no evidence for a low affinity site in either
neutrophils or mononuclear cells and the pharmacology of
inhibition of w3 hxdofetilide binding is different to that of
guinea pig myocytes. the ic 50 values for dofetilide, e4031,
clofilium and sotalol in human leukocytes are, however,
similar to the data in the present study. as shsy5y and
hek293 are human cell lines, it may be prudent to
consider that any alteration in pharmacology may reflect
species differences. geonzon et al. ž1998. indeed postulate
by a process of elimination that w3 hxdofetilide may bind to
sk ca channels in leukocytes. in agreement with these
authors, apamin ž10 mm. did not inhibit w3 hxdofetilide
binding in any of the cell lines examined in this paper;
however, dofetilide ž10 mm. did inhibit w125 ixapamin binding to  xxxg1988xxx  and rsk3 transfected cells by approximately
10% žfinlayson, unpublished observations.. these findings
appear to rule out a role for apamin-sensitive sk ca channels; however, that dofetilide inhibits or somehow interacts
with the apamin-insensitive sk ca channel žkohler et al.,
1996. cannot be ruled out, as mclarnon and wang ž1991.
demonstrated dofetilide inhibition of sk ca -mediated currents in ca1 hippocampal neurons with an ic 50 of 400
nm. these cells express apamin-insensitive sk channels
žstocker et al., 1999..
the identification of a low affinity site for dofetilide
and e4031 in the hamster cell line cho-k1 is in good
agreement with previously published data, as is the binding
site density žfiset et al., 1996.. however, again there is
very little electrophysiological evidence for the existence
of kq currents žrobertson and owen, 1993.. whether this
data represents w3 hxdofetilide binding to a different site, a

k. finlayson et al.r european journal of pharmacology 412 (2001) 203–212

different žnon-functional. conformation of the same channel or as discussed above, species differences in the pharmacology of w3 hxdofetilide binding require further clarification žficker et al., 1998; lees-miller et al., 2000..
indeed, the lack of  xxxg1232xxx  currents in cho-k1
cells and the inhibition of the stably expressed mouse
 xxxg1229xxx   xxxg1232xxx  current  xxxg708xxx  by another class
iii antiarrythmic tedisamil, again highlights the potential
for non-specific effects when using this class of compounds žrobertson and owen, 1993..
interestingly, the class iii antiarrythmic way 123,398
had no effect on w3 hxdofetilide binding in any of the three
cell lines examined, despite being able to functionally
block herg in shsy5y cells žfig. 2c.. blockade of
herg by way 123,398 is voltage independent unlike
that of e4031 and dofetilide žfaravelli et al., 1996. and
way 123,398 works faster than dofetilide when applied
extracellularly in shsy5y cells žfig. 2c.. these data
provide some evidence for the hypothesis that way
123,398 has a different mechanismrsite of action to other
class iii antiarrythmics; however, further studies are required to support this idea.
in conclusion, we have established conditions whereby
we can examine the pharmacology of endogenous
w3 hxdofetilide binding sites in the human cell lines
shsy5y and hek293. the pharmacological characteristics of the binding are similar in both cell lines despite no
functional evidence for a herg-like kq current in the
latter. these findings cast doubt over whether w3 hxdofetilide binding in these cells could be used as a preclinical
screen for i kr blockers. in addition, that w3 hxdofetilide is a
ligand specific for i kr rherg may need to be assumed
with caution until the binding site detected in hek293
cells can truly be identified.
