 xxxd3568xxx , a combined dopamine d1/d2 antagonist, versus haloperidol, a dopamine d2 antagonist, in tardive dyskinesia.  animal data suggest that a d1 antagonistic component in neuroleptic drugs counteracts development of dopamine supersensitivity and of tolerance to cataleptic effect. this has led to the hypothesis that neuroleptics with d1 antagonistic activity should cause a better suppression of tardive dyskinesia (td) and less rebound aggravation after withdrawal than pure d2 antagonists. in this study the effect of  xxxd3568xxx  (mixed d1/d2 antagonist) and haloperidol (d2 antagonist) was evaluated in chronic psychotic patients with td. fifteen patients completed a randomized crossover study with blind evaluation of td and parkinsonism. the test medications, haloperidol and  xxxd3568xxx , caused a significant suppression of td and a significant increase of parkinsonism. no significant differences between haloperidol and  xxxd3568xxx  were observed. no td aggravation was seen. the lack of differences between the mixed d1/d2 antagonist and a d2 antagonist suggest that tolerance and da supersensitivity play no or a minor role for development of td.
