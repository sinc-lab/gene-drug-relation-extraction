 xxxd3417xxx , a  xxxd3105xxx  derivative, is a vital component in many biological processes, including cell differentiation and embryo pattern formation (for review, see
[21]).  xxxd3417xxx , however, is also teratogenic at high

doses [lo]. anomalies in almost every organ system in
a number of animal species have been described when
excessive amounts of retinoids are introduced during the
appropriate stage of development (for review see [22]).
 xxxd3417xxx  treatment during the immediate postimplantation period (days 8-10) generally results in anomalies of the head, sensory organs, and the cardiovascular
system, while treatment with  xxxd3417xxx  later in gestation (days 11-14) generally results in limb and genitourinary defects [ 10, 11,241.
 xxxd3417xxx  has been suggested to provide positional information in the developing fetus [14, 15, 261. presently, however, it remains uncertain as to what the specific molecular mechanism of action of  xxxd3417xxx  is
during both normal and teratogenic development. one
hypothesis is that  xxxd3417xxx  can interact with the genome and modulate expression of specific genes. the
isolation of an apparent family of nuclear  xxxd3417xxx 
receptor (rar') cdnas including a-rar [6, 19, 291,
b-rar [2, 3,291 and y-rar [12,29] supports the possibility that  xxxd3417xxx  can modulate gene expression
via these ligand-inducible transcriptional enhancer factors. it is possible that at least some of the abnormalities
associated with teratogenic doses of  xxxd3417xxx  may
be due to altered gene expression which could involve
a-rar and/or p-rar.
therefore, the purpose of the experiments conducted
here was to determine the effect of teratogenic doses
of  xxxd3417xxx  on the expression of a-rar rnrna
and 8-rar mrna in fetuses in vivo. our results, reported here, demonstrate that in vivo only teratogenic
doses of  xxxd3417xxx  increased the level of p-rar
mrna and not a-rar mrna in the conceptuses, maternal liver and maternal kidney. in addition, p-rar
mrna levels were elevated by treatment with high doses
of  xxxd3417xxx  to a similar extent in fetuses at developmental stages which are both sensitive and insensitive
to teratogenic doses of  xxxd3417xxx . finally, treatment
with another teratogenic retinoid,  xxxd2071xxx , and a nonteratogenic retinoid, retinoyl p-glucuronide also increased fl-rar mrna levels in the conceptuses, maternal liver and maternal kidney.

abstract.  xxxd3417xxx  is required for normal growth
and development, however excessive doses are teratogenic. recently several nuclear  xxxd3417xxx  receptors
(rar) have been identified and postulated to mediate
the response of  xxxd3417xxx  at the gene level. we wished
to determine if a-rar mrna or /3-rar mrna levels
are modulated by teratogenic doses of  xxxd3417xxx  in
vivo. we have found that 8-rar mrna levels in 9-daygestation mouse conceptuses are increased as early as
3 h after administration of a completely teratogenic dose
of  xxxd3417xxx  (100 mg/kg body weight; b.w.) and reach
a maximum of approximately sixfold after 6 h of treatment. maternal liver and maternal kidney demonstrated
a similar pattern of increase in b-rar mrna, however
this was only approximately threefold.  xxxd3417xxx 
dose-response experiments demonstrated a reduced increase of /?-rar mrna levels with 10 mg/kg b.w. (minimally teratogenic dose), and no increase with a morephysiological dose of l mg/kg b.w. in the conceptuses.
8-rar mrna levels were elevated in 18-day-gestation
fetuses to a similar extent to that observed in the 9-daygestation conceptuses. therefore, the twofold difference
in the extent to which 8-rar mrna levels increase
does not occur because the fetuses are at a developmental stage that is sensitive to the teratogenic effects of
 xxxd3417xxx . finally, treatment with another teratogenic
retinoid,  xxxd2071xxx , and a nonteratogenic retinoid, retinoyl p-glucuronide, both resulted in increase in the level
of fl-rar mrna in the conceptuses and the maternal
tissues. therefore, an increase in j-rar mrna levels
caused by treatment with retinoids does not necessarily
commit a fetus to undergo an abnormal pattern of development characteristic of teratogenic retinoids.

experimeritul anirnuls. timed-pregnant female cd-1 strain mice
were obtained from charles river breeding laboratories,
kingston, ny on the 5th day of gestation. the gestation age of
the embryos is guaranteed to be within plus or minus a half day.
mice were maintained in pan-type cages with woodchip bedding
and were fed a commercial pelleted diet and water ad libitum.
on the 9th or 18th day of gestation the pregnant female mice
were given a single oral dose of one of the following: retinoic
acid (100, 10 or 1 mg/kg b.w.).  xxxd2071xxx  (equimolar dose based
on 100 mg/kg b.w.  xxxd3417xxx ) and retinoyl p-glucuronide (equimolar dose based on 100 mg/kg b.w.  xxxd3417xxx ).  xxxd3417xxx 
and  xxxd2071xxx  were a generous gift from dr. peter sorter, hoffmann laroche, nutley, nj., and retinoyl p-glucuronide was synthesized as previously reported [l]. control mice were given an
oral dose of peanut oil alone. mice were sacrificed at various times
ranging from 3 to 24 h after treatment, and the conceptuses or
fetuses, maternal liver and maternal kidney obtained for rna
isolation. it should be noted that at 9 days of gestation all the
conceptuses from one dam were pooled for rna isolation and
thus represent an individual determination, and at 18 days of gestation individual fetuses were obtained from a number of litters.
rna was isolated and the level of each transcript was determined
from samples obtained from three to six treatment dams per time
point and treatment.

plasmid clones. the r-rar clone was generously provided by ronald evans as a full-length cdna encoding human a-rar in
phc624 plasmid [6]. two psri cdna fragments (580 bp and
610 bp) were isolated together by electroelution from polyacrylamide gels, oligolabeled with '*p-dctp (new england nuclear,
boston, ma) [ 5 ] and used as a probe. the p-rar clone was generously provided by pierre chambon, institut de chimie biologique,
strabourg-cedex, france as a full-length cdna in plasmid psg5
[3]. two ecori cdna fragments (600 bp and 620 bp) were isolated
and oligolabeled as described above.
r n a isolation and anulysis. total rna from the conceptuses, the
maternal liver and the maternal kidney was prepared by the method
of tushinski et al. [28]. the concentration and purity of each rna
was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm.
the size and relative amount of both r-rar mrna and prar mrna was analyzed by northem-blot analysis. twenty micrograms total rna was denatured and run on a l % formaldehydelagarose gel as described by lehrach et al. [13]. the rna
was transferred either to nitrocellulose paper or zeta probe membrane (biorad, rockville, ca) as described by thomas [27]. prehybridization, hybridization and washing were done as previously
described [25]. bands were quantitated by scanning appropriate
exposures of the autoradiograms, which gave signals in the linear
range of the films with a hoefer model 1650 scanning densitometer
and hoefer gs365 densitometer software. the relative level of
either a-rar mrna or /?-rar mrna in each sample was calculated relative to the control value for that transcript arbitrarily
set to 1.0. the fold inductions represent the average+sd of three
to six individual samples/treatment.

fig. 1a-c. p- xxxd3417xxx  receptor (8-rar) mrna and a-rar
mrna levels in 9-day-gestation conceptuses treated with teratogenic doses of  xxxd3417xxx . nine-day-gestation cd-1 mice were
treated with an oral dose of 100 mg/kg (body weight) b.w. retinoic
acid (+) or peanut oil carrier ( - ) and sacrificed at various times
ranging from 3 to 24 h. total rna was isolated from the conceptuses of each litter and pooled (three to six litters/time-point). the
level of p-rar mrna and r-rar mrna was determined by
northern-blot analysis. appropriate exposures within the linear
range of the film were quantitated by densitometry. long exposures
revealed bands in all lanes of the autoradiograms. a and c are
representative autoradiograms of p-rar mrna levels (a) and
a-rar mrna levels (c). b is a graphic representation of the
relative level of /i-rar mrna. the relative level of each transcript
was calculated with the time zero level arbitrarily set to 1 .o. values
are mean fsd

b.w.  xxxd3417xxx  and sacrificed at various times thereafter. previous reports have clearly demonstrated that this
dose of  xxxd3417xxx  administered at 9 days of gestation
is teratogenic in all animals of the litter [lo, 241. only
one of the previously reported b-rar bands [20], which
was of approximately 3.4 kb, hybridized to the p-rar
probe in these conceptus rna samples. p-rar mrna
levels were elevated in the conceptuses 3 h after retinoic
acid treatment (earliest time-point tested). a maximal
increase of approximately sixfold occurred 6 h after  xxxd3417xxx  treatment, and by 18 h there was no longer
any detectable increase in the steady-state level of 8rar mrna in the conceptuses.
figure l c shows the level of a-rar mrna in the
same control and retinoic-acid-treated conceptuses as
described above. two bands, which were of approximately 3.6 kb and 2.8 kb [20], hybridized to the r-rar

105

probe in these conceptus rna samples. in contrast to
/i-rar mrna, the steady-state level of a-rar mrna
was not consistently altered by treatment with teratogenic doses of  xxxd3417xxx . however, there was a tendency
for the a-rar mrna levels in the conceptuses 12 and
18 h after  xxxd3417xxx  treatment to be slightly lower
than the untreated control samples. it is interesting to
note that although a-rna mrna levels were not influenced by treatment with  xxxd3417xxx , we did observe
an increase in the level of a-rar mrna in both the
retinoic-acid-treated and the control conceptuses at 9 h.
at 12, 18 and 24 h, the level of a-rar mrna in both
the control and retinoic-acid-treated conceptuses
dropped to a level which was higher than that observed
at 3 h but lower than that detected at 9 h. this most
likely represents a developmentally related change in the
level of a-rar mrna, which is independent of treatment with teratogenic doses of  xxxd3417xxx .
since we had observed an increase in the level of
p-rar mrna and not a-rar mrna in the conceptuses treated with teratogenic doses of  xxxd3417xxx , we
were next interested in determining if a similar increase
in the steady-state level of p-rar mrna occurred in
maternal tissues. we chose to study maternal liver and
maternal kidney for two reasons. first, each of these
tissues have been shown to contain both a-rar mrna
and p-rar mrna [20]. second, along with the small

control (0-0)

rafed

(0-0)

a

intestine these two tissues have been demonstrated to
contain the highest amount of  xxxd3417xxx  and its
metabolities after administration of  xxxd3417xxx  [ 171.
figure2a, b shows the steady-state level of p-rar
mrna in the liver and kidney of the mothers of the
conceptuses described in fig. 1. it should be noted that
unlike the 9-day-gestation conceptus samples we detected both of the reported b-rar bands (3.4 and
3.1 kb) [20] when the maternal tissue rna samples were
hybridized to the p-rar probe. as observed with the
conceptuses, the steady-state level of p-rar mrna
was increased in both the maternal liver and maternal
kidney as early as 3 h, was maximal at 6 h and was
back to control levels by 12 h after  xxxd3417xxx  treatment. however, as shown in fig. 2a, b, the maximum
increase in the steady-state level of /?-rar mrna in
the maternal liver and maternal kidney was only threefold as compared to the sixfold induction observed in
the conceptuses (see fig. 1b). as was seen with the conceptuses, we also observed that the level of a-rar
mrna in the maternal liver and maternal kidney was
not influenced by treatment with  xxxd3417xxx  (data not
shown).
thus, abnormally high doses of  xxxd3417xxx , which
cause teratogenicity in appropriately staged fetuses, increase p-rar mrna levels and not a-rar mrna
levels in 9-day-gestation conceptuses, maternal liver and
maternal kidney. however, the level of increase in the
9-day-gestation conceptuses (which are sensitive to teratogenic doses of  xxxd3417xxx ) of p-rar mrna was
twofold greater than that observed in the maternal tissues.

an increase in the steady-state level of p-rar mrna
in the 9-day-gestation conceptuses and maternal tissues.
as shown in fig. 3, p-rar mrna steady-state levels
were elevated approximately sixfold in the conceptuses
as previously observed (see fig. 1 a, b) 6 h after treatment with 100 mg/kg b.w.  xxxd3417xxx . a dose of  xxxd3417xxx  of 10mg/kg b.w. resulted in approximately a
threefold increase in f3-rar mrna level, while a dose
of  xxxd3417xxx  approaching physiological levels (1 mg/
kg b.w.) resulted in no significant increase in p-rar
mrna. similarly, we observed no significant increase
in the level of /?-rar mrna in the maternal liver and
maternal kidney when the dams were treated with 1 mg/
kg b.w.  xxxd3417xxx . however, in contrast to the conceptuses, we observed that treatment with both 100 mg/
kg b.w.  xxxd3417xxx  and 10 mg/kg b.w.  xxxd3417xxx 
resulted in an approximately threefold increase in prar mrna. finally, a-rar mrna levels in the conceptuses and maternal tissues were unaffected by treatment with any dose of  xxxd3417xxx  studied (data not
shown). thus, we could observe no significant increases
in the level of p-rar mrna in the 9-day-gestation
conceptuses or maternal tissues when doses approaching
physiological (1 mg/kg b.w.) were administered to the
dams.
egect of teratogenic doses of  xxxd3417xxx 
on p-rar mrna levels in 18-day-gestation fetuses

since we had observed that p-rar mrna levels were
elevated to a greater extent in the 9-day-gestation conceptuses (which are very sensitive to teratogenic doses
of  xxxd3417xxx ) compared to the maternal tissues, we
examined the effect of a teratogenic dose of  xxxd3417xxx 
on the level of p-rar mrna in 18-day-gestation fetuses. treatment of fetuses with teratogenic doses of  xxxd3417xxx  at this stage of development has not been
reported to result in developmental abnormalities [ 10,

11,241. figure 4 is a representative autoradiogram which
shows the level of p-rar mrna in 18-day-gestation
fetuses 6 h after treatment with 100 mg/kg b.w. retinoic
acid compared to the level of p-rar mrna in the
control, untreated 18-day-gestation fetuses. quantitation of several samples indicates an approximately sixfold induction in the level of p-rar mrna in the 18day-gestation fetuses treated with the teratogenic dose
of  xxxd3417xxx . this is very similiar to the level of induction observed in 9-day-gestation conceptuses 6 h after
treatment with the same dose of  xxxd3417xxx . therefore,
the twofold-higher increase in p-rar mrna levels in
the 9-day-gestation conceptuses compared to the maternal tissues was not due to the fact that these fetuses
were at a developmental stage which is sensitive to  xxxd3417xxx  teratogenicity .
the effect of  xxxd2071xxx  and retinoyl
/?-glucuronideon p-rar mrna levels

to further investigate the relationship between retinoic
acid teratogenicity and increases in 8-rar mrna levels, the effect of equimolar doses of another teratogenic
retinoid and a nonteratogenic retinoid on /i-rar
mrna levels was examined in 9-day-gestation conceptuses. we chose two derivatives:  xxxd2071xxx , a synthetic
 xxxd3417xxx  derivative, used in the treatment of psoriasis, which is a teratogen equally potent to  xxxd3417xxx 
[9] ; and retinoyl p-glucuronide, a water-soluble nontoxic
derivative of  xxxd3417xxx , which has been shown to
be nonteratogenic [7]. as can be seen in fig. 5 , treatment
with  xxxd2071xxx  (a teratogenic retinoid) resulted in a similar increase in p-rar mrna levels in the conceptuses
(sixfold) and the maternal liver and kidney (3.5- and

2.7-fold, respectively) as  xxxd3417xxx . treatment with
the nonteratogenic retinoid, retinoyl 8-glucuronide, resulted in a 2.4-fold increase in p-rar mrna levels
in the conceptuses as compared to a sixfold increase
with  xxxd3417xxx  treatment. in contrast, fl-rar mrna
levels were increased in the maternal liver and maternal
kidney (3.2-fold and 2.2-fold, respectively). these levels
are very similar to those observed with  xxxd3417xxx 
treatment. finally, treatment with either  xxxd2071xxx  or
retinoyl p-glucuronide had no influence on the level of
a-rar mrna in the conceptuses or the maternal tissues (data not shown). thus, both teratogenic and nonteratogenic retinoids can qualitatively elevate p-rar
mrna levels in conceptuses and maternal tissus.

discussion
the studies reported here explored the relationship between teratogenic doses of  xxxd3417xxx  and the steadystate levels of p-rar mrna and a-rar mrna in
vivo. consistent with the in vitro data in hepatoma cells
[4], we have observed that p-rar mrna levels are
sensitive to  xxxd3417xxx  treatment in vivo while a-rar
mrna levels appear to be insensitive even to abnormally high teratogenic doses of  xxxd3417xxx . in addition,
these data provide new important information related
to the response of the p-rar gene to retinoids in vivo
and the potential relationship of this response to the
teratogenic effects of retinoids. first, only abnormally
high teratogenic doses of  xxxd3417xxx  result in a rapid
increase in the level of p-rar mrna in vivo as compared to physiological doses in vitro. second, the increase in p-rar mrna levels in vivo is transient, compared to a prolonged response in vitro. third, the extent
of increase in /i-rar mrna levels in vivo was 3- to
6-fold depending on the tissue, compared to 50-fold in
vitro. fourth, fetuses at a developmental stage that is
sensitive to the teratogenic effects of  xxxd3417xxx  do
not demonstrate any difference in the extent of increase
in /?-rar mrna compared to fetuses at an insensitive
developmental stage. fifth, an increase in p-rar
mrna levels in conceptuses and maternal tissues also
occurs as a result of treatment with a nonteratogenic
retinoid, retinoyl p-glucuronide.
these studies demonstrate that a-rar mrna levels
and fl-rar mrna levels are regulated differently with
respect to  xxxd3417xxx  treatment in vivo. in fact, even
with teratogenic doses of  xxxd3417xxx  we were unable
to detect any alteration in the level of a-rar mrna.
this is consistent with the report of de the et al. [4]
for hepatoma cells in vitro. thus, a-rar and /i-rar
mrna levels are influenced differentially by retinoic
acid treatment in vivo and in vitro.
the increase in /i-rar mrna levels was very rapid
after treatment with  xxxd3417xxx . as early as 3 h after
treatment, we observed almost the maximum increase
in p-rar mrna levels in the conceptuses and maternal
tissues. this increase in the steady-state level of p-rar
mrna was transient, in that by 12-18 h after treatment
with  xxxd3417xxx  the level of fl-rar mrna was back

to the normal untreated level. this is in contrast with
the in vitro data of de the et al. [4], from which they
observed a rapid increase in p-rar mrna levels,
which was prolonged for at least 24 h after treatment
with  xxxd3417xxx . this difference between the in vivo
and in vitro response may be due to the existence in
vivo of additional biochemical mechanisms, not present
or less efficient in cells in culture, which are involved
in the metabolism of  xxxd3417xxx  to inactive metabolites
and/or the excretion of  xxxd3417xxx . studies of retinoic
acid metabolism in both mice and rats have demonstrated that  xxxd3417xxx  is rapidly taken up by tissues
and then declines in an exponential fashion to near-pretreatment levels by 6-8 h in most adult tissues, whole
embryos and limb buds [8,23].
it is very interesting to note that we did not observe
any significant induction in the level of p-rar mrna
in either the conceptuses or the maternal tissues examined until the dam was administered 10 mg/kg b.w.  xxxd3417xxx . this dose of  xxxd3417xxx  has been shown
to result in an approximately 50-fold increase in the level
of  xxxd3417xxx  in mouse embryo limb buds [23] and
generally results in developmental abnormalities in only
a few of the fetuses in each litter [18, 231. at a dose
of 1 mg/kg b.w., which is not teratogenic but approximately 20 times higher than the daily dose of retinoic
acid necessary to support adequate growth of vitamin-adeficient animals [16, 301, we could observe no significant change in the level of p-rar mrna in the conceptuses or the maternal tissues. hence, in vivo it would
appear that induction of fl-rar mrna levels occurs
only at abnormally high (teratogenic) doses of retinoic
acid. this is in contrast to the in vitro data in which
de the and coworkers observed increases in p-rar
mrna at doses of  xxxd3417xxx  as low as lo-’ m [4].
it is possible that in vivo the dose of  xxxd3417xxx  necessary to induce p-rar mrna levels must be greater
than the ligandless cellular  xxxd3417xxx -binding protein
(crabp) levels and the capacity of the retinoic-acidmetabolizing enzymes. these mechanisms may not exist
or may be less efficient in hepatoma cells in vitro.
throughout these studies, we have observed that the
increase in p-rar mrna levels in 9-day-gestation conceptuses and 18-day-gestation featuses is twice that in
the maternal tissues. the reason for this difference in
the response of p-rar mrna levels is unclear. one
possible explanation is that that the conceptuses and
fetuses concentrate different amounts of these high doses
of  xxxd3417xxx  than the maternal tissues or that the
conceptuses and fetuses are less efficient in metabolizing
 xxxd3417xxx  to inactive compounds and excreting them.
therefore, the amount of free  xxxd3417xxx  or derivatives
that is active in increasing p-rar mrna levels in the
conceptuses is greater than that in the maternal tissues.
however, what is clear is that this twofold difference
in the induction of fl-rar mrna in the conceptuses
and fetuses compared to the maternal tissues is not related to whether the fetuses are at a developmental stage
sensitive to teratogenic doses of  xxxd3417xxx .
equimolar doses of the teratogenic retinoid,  xxxd2071xxx , were equally potent in the induction of p-rar

108

mrna levels in both conceptuses and maternal tissues.
in addition, the nonteratogenic retinoid, retinoyl p-glucuronide, increased p-rar mrna levels in the conceptuses and in the maternal tissues. the extent of the increase in the maternal tissues was similar to that observed with  xxxd3417xxx  treatment, while the level of
increase in the conceptuses was approximately half that
observed with  xxxd3417xxx  treatment. examination of
the metabolism of retinoyl p-glucuronide has demonstrated that retinoyl /3-glucuronide is slowly hydrolyzed
to  xxxd3417xxx  in tissues of adult rats [ 11 although very
little retinoyl p-glucuronide, or  xxxd3417xxx  derived
from it, is found in the fetus [7]. hence, the smaller
increase in p-rar mrna levels in the conceptuses after
retinoyl p-glucuronide treatment may be simply related
to the amount of the compound that is localized in the
concept uses.
finally, it appears that an increase in the level of
p-rar mrna in conceptuses at a developmental stage
sensitive to the teratogenic effects of  xxxd3417xxx  does
not commit the fetus to undergo an abnormal pattern
of development leading to the teratogenic effects of  xxxd3417xxx . however, we cannot rule out the possibility
that a 2.4-fold increase in p-rar mrna levels associated with treatment with retinoyl p-glucuronide is insufficient to result in abnormal development and rather an
increase closer to 6-fold, like that observed with  xxxd2071xxx  and  xxxd3417xxx , is necessary.
