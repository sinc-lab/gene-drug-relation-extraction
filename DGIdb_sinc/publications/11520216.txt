ellagitannins and hexahydroxydiphenoyl esters as inhibitors of vertebrate  xxxg2197xxx .  ellagitannins isolated from various plant sources as well as newly synthesized n-alkyl (c(1)-c(18)) esters of hexahydroxydiphenyl (hhdp)  xxxd2537xxx  were evaluated as enzyme inhibitors of recombinant rat  xxxg2197xxx , a rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis. among the ellagitannins tested, pedunculagin (ic(50) = 2.0 microm) and eugeniin (ic(50) = 1.6 microm), both containing (s)-hhdp ester group(s), showed remarkable inhibition, which was more potent than those of previously reported substrate analogue inhibitors. furthermore,  xxxd1979xxx  (ic(50) = 2.0 microm), a bislactone formed by hydrolytic release of a hhdp group from ellagitannins, was also a good inhibitor of the enzyme. on the other hand, the synthetic hhdp esters with c(6) (ic(50) = 0.93 microm) and c(8) alkyl side chains (ic(50) = 0.83 microm) showed potent enzyme inhibition at the submicromolar concentration range, while esters with shorter chain lengths (c(1)-c(4)) and a c(18) ester exhibited moderate inhibition (ic(50) = 8-47 microm).
