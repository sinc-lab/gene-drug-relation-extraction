abstract
choline dehydrogenase (chdh) and betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase ( xxxg262xxx ) are 2 enzymes involved in choline
oxidation.  xxxg262xxx  is expressed at high levels in rat liver and its expression is regulated by dietary met and choline.  xxxg262xxx  is
also found in rat kidney, albeit in substantially lower amounts, but it is not known whether kidney  xxxg262xxx  expression is
regulated by dietary met or choline. similarly, chdh activity is highest in the liver and kidney, but the regulation of its
expression by diet has not been thoroughly investigated. sprague dawley rats (;50 g) were fed, for 9 d in 2 3 3 factorial
design (n ¼ 8), an l-amino acid–defined diet varying in  xxxd2595xxx  (0.125, 0.3, or 0.8%) and choline (0 or 25 mmol/kg diet). liver and
kidney  xxxg262xxx  and chdh were assessed using enzymatic, western blot, and real-time pcr analyses. liver samples were
also fixed for histological analysis. liver  xxxg262xxx  activity was 1.3-fold higher in rats fed the met deficient diet containing
choline, which was reflected in corresponding increases in mrna content and immunodetectable protein. independent of
dietary choline, supplemental met increased hepatic  xxxg262xxx  activity ;30%. kidney  xxxg262xxx  and liver chdh expression were
refractory to these diets. some degree of fatty liver developed in all rats fed a choline-devoid diet, indicating that supplemental met cannot completely compensate for the lack of dietary choline in growing rats. j. nutr. 136: 2279–2283, 2006.

introduction
betaine (bet;2 n,n,n-trimethylglycine) is an intermediate in the
choline oxidation pathway. the first committed step for the formation of bet is catalyzed by choline dehydrogenase (chdh;
ec 1.1.99.1), which localizes to the matrix side of the inner
mitochondrial membrane. it is an fad-dependent enzyme that is
thought to be connected to ubiquinone (coenzyme q) in the electron transport chain (1,2). chdh catalyzes the conversion of
choline to bet aldehyde, which is further oxidized to bet by
the mitochondrial matrix enzyme, bet aldehyde dehydrogenase
(badh; ec 1.2.1.8). once formed, bet leaves the mitochondria
and can be demethylated by betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase ( xxxg262xxx : ec 2.1.1.5), the third enzyme in the choline
oxidation pathway.  xxxg262xxx  catalyzes the transfer of a methyl
group from bet to homocysteine (hcy), forming dimethylglycine
(dmg) and methionine (met), respectively. following the
 xxxg262xxx  reaction, the last 2 reactions of choline oxidation
convert dmg to glycine and are catalyzed by the mitochondrial
enzymes dimethylglycine dehydrogenase and sarcosine dehydrogenase, respectively.

 xxxg262xxx  has a major role in the overall conversion of hcy to
met (3), and more recently it has been shown that in vivo
inhibition of  xxxg262xxx  in mice causes hyperhomocysteimia and a
reduction in liver s- xxxd3156xxx  (4). there is substantial
interest in the regulation of hcy and met metabolism, because
an elevated level of plasma total hcy is thought to be an
independent risk factor for the development of coronary, cerebral, and peripheral vascular disease (5,6).  xxxg262xxx  is abundant
in mammalian liver (0.5–2% of soluble liver protein), and it is
also found in the kidney of some species, particularly humans,
pigs, and guinea pigs (7–9), but substantially lower levels are
found in rat kidney (.95% lower specific activity than rat liver).
dietary met and methyl donor (bet and choline) intake have
been shown to modulate liver  xxxg262xxx  activity and gene expression. specifically, diets deficient in met with excess methyl donor
have significantly increased hepatic  xxxg262xxx  activity and expression in rats (10–12). however, there are few data concerning the
effect of supplemental met on hepatic  xxxg262xxx , nor has the
nutritional regulation of kidney  xxxg262xxx  been examined.
chdh is primarily active in the liver and kidney of mammals
(1) but, relative to other respiratory chain enzymes, it has not
been extensively studied. little is known about its kinetic
properties and whether expression or flux through the enzyme is
influenced by diet and/or physiological state. we postulated that,
because chdh is the first step in the oxidation of choline and
provides the bet that  xxxg262xxx  uses, both dietary met and choline

availability may affect chdh expression in a manner similar to
that of  xxxg262xxx . indeed, schneider and vance (13) reported that
rats fed a choline deficient diet have a 30–41% reduction in the
mitochondrial oxidation of choline to betaine.
we sought to determine whether  xxxg262xxx  and chdh are coordinately regulated by dietary met and choline, how supplemental met affects hepatic  xxxg262xxx , and whether these nutrients
are involved in the regulation of kidney  xxxg262xxx  expression.

materials and methods
diets and animal protocol
the experimental protocol was approved by the university of illinois
institutional animal care and use committee. the nutrient levels in the
l-amino acid–defined diets used in this study, except for  xxxd2595xxx , l-cystine,
and choline, were at the levels recommended for growing rats by the
american institute of nutrition (ain-93g) and were prepared by dyets.
the diets varied in  xxxd2595xxx  and choline concentrations (table 1). the
dietary treatments were chosen based on the requirements for growing
rodents as described by the national research council (14,15). the
recommended level of met in a purified diet was defined as 6 g/kg diet
(0.6%), where half of the met could be replaced with cystine (0.3% met;
0.3% cystine). all diets used in this study contained 3 g cystine/kg diet
(0.3%) and diets varied in met by the following 3 levels: 1.25 g met/kg
diet (0.125%), termed deficient; 3 g met/kg diet (0.3%), termed adequate; and 8 g met/kg diet (0.8%), termed supplemental. whereas the
recommendations for the total sulfur amino acid (met 1 cystine) concentrations of a purified diet for maximum growth in rodents has been
subsequently reported to be 7.4 g/kg diet (16), the levels as defined in this
study (deficient, adequate, and supplemental) are still applicable and
have been used in previous studies, both in this laboratory and others, to
investigate the affect of these nutrients on  xxxg262xxx  expression (10–12).
similarly, the recommended intake of choline for the growing rodent has
been defined as 10 mmol/kg diet. two levels of choline were used in this
study (0 mmol/kg diet, termed devoid and 25 mmol/kg diet, termed
supplemental).
all diets contained 10 g/kg diet of succinylsulfathiazole (sigma), an
antibiotic that was used to inhibit the microbial metabolism of choline in
the gastrointestinal tract, but, because of its use, all diets were supplemented with  xxxd2563xxx  sodium bisulfite (50 mg/kg diet; sigma).
the feeding trial was conducted using 3-wk old sprague-dawley rats
(n ¼ 48; harlan), which were housed in standard shoebox housing (3/
cage) in a light (12-h light/12-h dark) and temperature (23c) controlled
room. all rats were given free access to a met and choline adequate diet
(3 g/kg and 10 mmol/kg of diet, respectively) for 3 d to allow adjustment to
the purified diet. following the adjustment period, the rats were divided
into 6 groups of 8, such that mean body weight did not differ among
groups. rats were housed individually in hanging stainless-steel cages. all
rats had free access to water and were provided 1 of the 6 diets described
above. the duration of the feeding study (9 d) was based on previous reports investigating the effect of these nutrients on  xxxg262xxx  expression, where the typical feeding study duration ranged from 5 to 16 d
(10–12).
when rats are fed diets severely restricted in any essential amino acid,
they voluntarily decrease their food intake by up to 40–50% (g/d). therefore, food intake among the groups fed the adequate and supplemental
met diets (3.0 and 8.0 g/kg diet, respectively) were restricted to the mean
food intake of the groups fed the diets deficient in met (1.25 g/kg diet).
two groups consumed the met deficient diets ad libitum; intakes did not
differ between these groups. for each rat, food intake and weight were
recorded daily. rats were killed via co2 inhalation at the end of the trial
period and their liver and kidneys excised, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen,
and stored at 280c until analysis.
histochemistry
liver samples were fixed in 10% buffered formalin (12 h) and stored in
70% ethanol until embedding in paraffin. paraffin blocks were sectioned
into 3-mm slices, mounted onto glass slides, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.

assay procedures
enzyme assays. liver  xxxg262xxx  specific activity was determined as
described by garrow (17). kidney  xxxg262xxx  was measured the same
way, except that the concentration and specific activity of the 14c-bet
(250 mmol/l; 0.5 mci) was changed to increase the assay sensitivity.
liver mitochondrial chdh activity was measured as described previously (18).
western analysis. liver and kidney homogenates were probed for
 xxxg262xxx  protein by the procedure described by delgado-reyes and
garrow (18). liver mitochondria were probed for chdh protein using
the same procedure, except 5 mg total protein were loaded onto the gels
and primary antibodies (polyclonal) were prepared from rabbits
immunized with chdh peptides conjugated to bovine  xxxg124xxx 
(t. a. garrow, unpublished data).
relative quantification of  xxxg262xxx  and chdh expression by taqman
real-time pcr. rat liver and kidney total rna isolation was performed
using the sv total rna system kit (promega). first strand cdna synthesis was performed using total rna, random hexamer primers, and
multiscribe reverse transcriptase from the taqman reverse transcriptase
reagents (abi). the oligonucleotide primers and taqman minor groove
binding (mgb) probes used for real-time pcr amplification were
as follows:  xxxg262xxx  5#cgggcagaccgtacaatcc 3# (sense primer),
5#-ctttcgtcactccccaagca-3# (antisense primer), 5#-6famcgatgtccaagccgg-3# (mgb probe); and chdh 5#-aaggacggccagagccacaa-3# (sense primer), 5#-gcccccgctcaggatca-3# (antisense primer), 5#-6fam-cttacgtcagcagggag-3#
(mgb probe). the ribosomal 18s gene was used as the endogenous
control (taqman 18s ribosomal control kit; abi). real-time pcr was
performed in triplicate on an abi prism 7700 sequence detection system
(384-well plate). the relative abundance of amplified cdna was
calculated using the standard curve method, where an independent rat
liver cdna sample was diluted (a total of 6, 10-fold serial dilutions
producing concentrations ranging from 100 ng to 10 pg cdna) and realtime pcr performed in triplicate to generate the standard curve for each
gene ( xxxg262xxx , chdh, and 18s). results were calculated as mean relative
 xxxg262xxx  or chdh expression/18s mrna values.
for  xxxg262xxx  and chdh enzyme activity and mrna expression
analyses, treatment group 4 (0.3% met; 25 mmol/kg of choline) was
assigned the relative value of 1 and was used as the control group.
although a true control diet would contain both adequate met (0.3%)
and adequate choline (10 mmol/kg diet) we chose not to include this
treatment group in the present study because previous results showed
that liver  xxxg262xxx  activity (our positive control for dietary treatment) is
refractory to changes in choline intake when dietary met is adequate or
supplemental (10,12). rather than adding another level of choline
(10 mmol/kg diet) in our study, we opted to use only 2 levels of choline
(devoid or supplemental) because we knew these diets should affect liver
 xxxg262xxx  expression and also simplify our experimental design to a 2-way
anova.
statistics
tests for significant differences among the 6 groups were performed by
2-way anova, using the general linear model procedure of sas/stat
(sas). when significant main effects were obtained, the post-hoc
bonferroni correction for multiple pair-wise comparisons was applied.
differences were considered significant at p # 0.05. data are expressed

less weight (p , 0.001) than those fed the diets containing
adequate (groups 3 and 4) and supplemental (groups 5 and 6)

0.125% met diets were severely deficient, although all rats
gained weight. the growth performance of rats fed the metadequate diet devoid of choline (group 3) was significantly lower

than that of rats fed the diet with supplemental levels of met and
choline (group 6), but it did not significantly differ in rats fed the
met-adequate diet containing supplemental choline (group 4) or
in those fed the diet containing excess met but devoid of choline
(group 5; table 1).
liver and kidney  xxxg262xxx . we expected that the diets used in this
study would result in a range of hepatic  xxxg262xxx  activities
(10–12), which we observed (fig. 1a). rats fed the met-deficient
diet containing supplemental choline (group 2) had higher
 xxxg262xxx  activities (p , 0.01) than the other groups.  xxxg262xxx 
activity was 1.3-fold higher in this group than in rats fed the
met-adequate diet containing supplemental choline (group 4),
which is consistent with previous findings (11,12). liver  xxxg262xxx 
activity also was ;30% greater in rats fed the diets containing
supplemental met (groups 5 and 6) than in those fed the metadequate diets (groups 3 and 4). nonetheless,  xxxg262xxx  activities
of rats fed the met-supplemented diets were significantly lower
than those consuming the diet deficient in met with supplemental choline (fig. 1a). as expected (10,12), adding choline to
either the met-adequate or met-supplemented diets did not
affect hepatic  xxxg262xxx  activity. liver  xxxg262xxx  protein content
mirrored activity levels (fig. 1b).
liver relative  xxxg262xxx  mrna expression was also higher in
rats fed the met-deficient diet containing supplemental choline
than in those fed the met-adequate diet containing supplemental
choline (1.7-fold; p ¼ 0.032). the variation of  xxxg262xxx  mrna
measured within groups precluded us from detecting any
additional significant differences.
rat kidney  xxxg262xxx  activity was not significantly affected by
the diet treatments (fig. 1c). moreover, kidney  xxxg262xxx  mrna
expression (data not shown) and immunodetectable protein
content did not differ among the groups (fig. 1d). within-group
variation of kidney bhmtexpression was much greater than that
of liver  xxxg262xxx  expression.
liver chdh. although statistically there was a significant effect
of methionine on chdh activity, and a choline-methionine
interaction, the magnitude of the differences was small (fig. 2a)
and probably not physiologically important. indeed, the differences in activity were not reflected in chdh protein concentrations (fig. 2b) or hepatic chdh mrna expression (data not
shown).
liver lipids. fatty liver was observed in all rats fed the diets
devoid of choline (fig. 3a,c,e). however, the severity of fatty
infiltration decreased as the met concentration of the diet
increased. it is important that even supplemental met (8 g/kg

liver, indicating that supplemental met cannot completely replace the need for choline to prevent the development of fatty
liver in young growing rats.

discussion
previous studies have shown that the specific activity and expression of hepatic  xxxg262xxx  varies with the dietary intake of sulfur
amino acids, choline, and bet (10–12,19). specifically, the greatest
changes have been in animals fed met-deficient diets in combination with excess methyl donor (choline or bet), with the upregulation increasing with the severity of met-restriction and the
degree of methyl donor supplementation. these findings were
confirmed in this study. there was a #1.7-fold increase in hepatic
 xxxg262xxx  activity, protein content, and mrna expression in rats fed
a met-deficient diet containing supplemental choline (0.125%
met; 25 mmol choline/kg diet) over those fed a met-adequate diet
with supplemental choline (0.3% met; 25 mmol choline/kg diet)
(fig. 1a,b). in addition, rats fed diets containing supplemental met
diet and choline dehydrogenase expression

based on previous work from our laboratory (11,12) and of others
(10,19). hence, quantifying liver  xxxg262xxx  expression in this study
served as a positive control for the dietary treatments.
this report is, to our knowledge, the first to have evaluated
the effect of these nutrients on kidney  xxxg262xxx  activity. whereas
 xxxg262xxx  is expressed primarily in the liver of rats (7,8) it is present
in the kidney, with .95% lower specific activity than that of the
liver (t. a. garrow, unpublished results). our data show that
kidney  xxxg262xxx  is refractory to dietary met and choline intake
(fig. 1c). the differential tissue regulation of  xxxg262xxx  between
liver and kidney is likely to be a means of controlling tissue bet
concentrations. bet is not only a methyl donor, but it is accumulated as an osmoprotectant in a variety of cells, particularly
the kidney medulla, where it protects the cells from damage from
high salt and urea concentrations. thus, the primary role of bet
in the kidney is likely to be as an osmoprotectant, rather than a
methyl donor. indeed, in guinea pigs, high  xxxd3213xxx 
intake decreases both kidney and liver  xxxg262xxx  activity by #50%
(18).
chdh mediates the first and committed step in the oxidation
of choline to bet. to date, very few data are available regarding
the potential regulation of mammalian chdh expression by
diet. in chesapeake bay and atlantic oysters, it has been reported that chdh cannot function rapidly enough to saturate
badh, thus chdh activity might be the rate-limiting step of
endogenous bet synthesis. chdh has also been shown to be
competitively inhibited by both bet aldehyde and bet (20).
chdh may have an important role in modulating bet concentrations and, if so, its activity could modulate flux through
 xxxg262xxx . we sought to determine whether hepatic chdh expression is modulated by dietary met and choline availability in a
manner similar to  xxxg262xxx . however, our results indicate that
chdh is not affected by dietary met and choline. no differences in mrna levels (not shown) or protein concentration
(fig. 2b) were observed in any of the treatment groups. although there was a significant interaction between met and
choline on hepatic chdh activity, the effect was small (fig. 2a)
and probably not physiologically important. supporting our
findings, wong and thompson also found no effect on either
hepatic chdh or badh activity in rats fed a choline deficient
diet for 2 d and only a small reduction when choline deficiency
was prolonged for up to 13 d (21).
schneider and vance (13) reported that the oxidation of
choline to bet was reduced in mitochondria isolated from rats
fed choline deficient diets, compared with those fed choline sufficient diets. in addition, mitochondria from phosphatidylethanolamine n-methyltransferase and multidrug-resistant protein-2
double knockout mice have little ability to oxidize choline to
bet, as reported by li et al. (22). it is possible the reduction in
choline oxidation measured in these studies was the result of a
reduction of chdh expression, which would conflict with the
results reported here and those of wong and thompson (21).
however, no specific measurement of chdh activity or protein,
or mrna content were reported in the studies by schneider and
vance (13) or li et al. (22). one possibility that might explain
these seemingly disparate results is that the rate-limiting step in
the oxidation of choline to bet formation could be its transport
into the mitochondria, rather than chdh activity. whereas
choline can enter mitochondria via a high capacity nonsaturable
diffusion process, which is dependent on a high membrane
potential, there is also a low-capacity high-affinity choline transporter in the inner membrane in rat mitochondria. porter et al.
(23) and kaplan et al. (24) have estimated that at physiological choline concentrations the transport-mediated process is

dominant (90%) and that the rate-limiting step in the mitochondrial oxidation of choline to bet might be its transport into
the organelle. taken together, these results indicate that the expression of the mitochondrial choline transporter could be influenced by dietary choline, an idea that warrants further
investigation.
interestingly, fatty infiltration in the liver was observed in all
rats fed the choline-devoid diets (fig. 3a,c,e). the  xxxd242xxx 
effect of supplemental met was not enough to completely prevent
fatty infiltration, although it markedly reduced lipid accumulation compared with the met-deficient diet. this suggests that in
young, growing rats, choline is essential because de novo synthesis via sequential methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine is
not sufficient to meet metabolic demands.
in summary, although both dietary met and choline availability markedly affect both hepatic  xxxg262xxx  activity and expression, these nutrients have negligible affects on kidney  xxxg262xxx  or
liver chdh expression in rats.
