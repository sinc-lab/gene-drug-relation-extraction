effects of all-trans  xxxd3417xxx ,  xxxd77xxx , and
cd2043 on both cell growth and differentiation. in

increased cell growth slightly and lipid-forming colonies dramatically in a clear dose-related manner to a
maximum of 73.7% 6 6.7%  xxxd1891xxx ±6 m (p < 0.001).
our data suggest that  xxxd3417xxx  receptors and
retinoid x receptors differ in their roles in sebocyte
growth and differentiation: (i)  xxxd3417xxx  receptors, especially the b and/or g subtypes, mediate
both the antiproliferative and antidifferentiative
effects of retinoids; (ii) retinoid x receptors mediate
prominent differentiative and weak proliferative
effects; (iii) the antiproliferative and antidifferentiative effects of all-trans  xxxd3417xxx  are probably
mediated by  xxxd3417xxx  receptors, whereas its differentiative effect at high dose may be mediated by
retinoid x receptors via all-trans  xxxd3417xxx  metabolism to 9-cis  xxxd3417xxx , the natural ligand of
retinoid x receptors. key words:  xxxd3417xxx /retinoic

 xxxd3417xxx  derivatives (retinoids) exert their pleiotropic effects on cell development through speci®c
nuclear receptors, the  xxxd3417xxx  receptors and
retinoid x receptors. despite recent progress in
understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of retinoid activity, it is unknown which of the
retinoid receptor pathways are involved in the speci®c processes of sebocyte growth and development.
in this study, we investigated the roles of speci®c
retinoid receptors in sebocyte growth and differentiation, by testing the effects of selective  xxxd3417xxx 
receptor and retinoid x receptor ligands at concentrations between 10±10 m and 10±6 m in a primary rat
preputial cell monolayer culture system. cell growth
was determined by number of cells and colonies, and
cell differentiation by analysis of lipid-forming colonies. all-trans  xxxd3417xxx  and selective  xxxd3417xxx 
receptor agonists ( xxxd77xxx  =  xxxd77xxx , an rar-b,g
agonist; cd2043 =  xxxd3417xxx  receptor pan-agonist;
and cd336 = am580, an rar-a agonist) caused signi®cant decreases in numbers of cells, colonies, and
lipid-forming colonies, but with an exception at high
doses of all-trans  xxxd3417xxx  (10±6 m), with which
only a small number of colonies grew but they
became twice as differentiated as controls

for treatment of acne vulgaris, yet the role of speci®c retinoid
receptors in mediating the diverse retinoid effects is unclear.
the highly pleiotropic effects of retinoids appear to be mediated
by speci®c nuclear receptors that belong to the superfamily of
nuclear receptors and act as ligand-dependent transcriptional
regulators (evans, 1988; green and chambon, 1988). two distinct
classes of retinoid receptors have been identi®ed: the  xxxd3417xxx 
receptor (rar) and the retinoid x receptor (rxr). each class of
receptor contains three subtypes: a, b, and g (reviewed by
mangelsdorf et al, 1995). the natural ligands of rars and rxrs
have been identi®ed as all-trans ra (atra) and 9-cis ra,
respectively (petkovich et al, 1987; heyman et al, 1992; levin et al,
1992). rar functions only as a heterodimer with rxr (durand
et al, 1992; kliewer et al, 1992a; zhang et al, 1992a). in contrast,
rxr forms either homodimers or heterodimers with other ligandregulated receptors including peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptors (ppars) and thus functions as a key regulator of the
activity of several nuclear receptors (zhang et al, 1992b;
mangelsdorf and evans, 1995). the characterization of dna
response elements has revealed a complex pattern of retinoid
recognition and activation (mangelsdorf et al, 1995).

ebocytes are specialized sebaceous gland epithelial cells
that differentiate by accumulating neutral fat droplets until
they burst and liberate their holocrine secretion, sebum
(wheatley, 1986). although  xxxd3417xxx  (ra) and its
derivatives (retinoids) in trace amounts promote sebocyte
growth and differentiation, larger doses induce atrophy of
sebaceous glands and a decrease in lipid production (landthaler
et al, 1980; zouboulis et al, 1993). retinoids have long been used

as current retinoid research targets the development of receptorselective retinoids for tailoring and/or improving their therapeutic
pro®les, it seems important to know which of the retinoid receptor
pathways are involved in the different cellular processes. previous
studies have addressed the role of atra, 9-cis ra and other
retinoids in attenuating sebocyte growth and differentiation
(reviewed by geiger, 1995). it has been dif®cult, however, to
identify the distinct role of each retinoid receptor, since atra
may not only act directly on rar but may also act on rxr via its
metabolism to 9-cis ra (heyman et al, 1992; levin et al, 1992).
recently, selective rar and rxr ligand-activators and their
antagonists have become available to dissect the molecular pathways
involved in retinoid action (reviewed by orfanos et al, 1997). in
this study, using selective rar and rxr ligands and a primary rat
preputial cell monolayer culture system, we have investigated the
role of the different classes and subtypes of retinoid receptors in
sebocyte growth and differentiation.
materials and methods
retinoids atra was purchased from sigma (st. louis, mo). other
retinoids, characterized in table i, were supplied by galderma r & d
(sophia antipolis, france). retinoids were dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx 
to a concentration of 10±3 m and stored at ±20°c in light-proof containers.
the half-maximal activating concentrations obtained in the f9 cell model
and the binding properties of these compounds (martin et al, 1992;
charpentier et al, 1995; unpublished data) are shown in table i.
cell culture single cell suspensions were prepared from the preputial
glands of young adult male sprague-dawley rats and plated on a
 xxxd2655xxx -c-treated 3t3-j2 ®broblast feeder layer at a density of
approximately 75,000 preputial cells and 200,000 3t3 cells per 35 mm
well in dulbecco's modi®ed eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. on
day 3 the medium was switched to a serum-free chemically de®ned cell
culture medium containing 4 3 10±8 m  xxxd3105xxx  (cellgro complete,
mediatech, va), which was supplemented with 10±6 m insulin, 10±10 m
choleratoxin, 10±6 m hydrocortisone, and antibiotics as previously reported
(laurent et al, 1992; rosen®eld et al, 1999). retinoids were added to the
medium under subdued ambient light at concentrations between 10±10 m
and 10±6 m from day 3 to day 9, during which time the medium was
changed every other day. in each experiment treatments were added
simultaneously in triplicate.
cell growth cell growth was assessed by counting the number of cells
and colonies on day 9. after 3t3 cells were removed by a brief incubation
with 0.02% ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, cell suspensions were
prepared by incubation of cultured cells with 0.25% trypsin and 0.02%
ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid for 10 min and repeated pipettings. after
pelleting at 1000 3 g, cells from triplicate 35 mm wells were resuspended
into phosphate-buffered saline and counted twice in a hemocytometer. the
total number of sebocyte colonies per well was counted by light
microscopy at 253 magni®cation after staining (below).
cell differentiation cell differentiation was assessed by lipid staining
and analysis of lipid-forming colonies (lfcs) on day 9 (rosen®eld et al,

1999). cell cultures were ®xed and stained with oil red o. lipid
formation in sebocyte colonies was quanti®ed by light microscopy at 25±
403 in four groups according to the number of stained cells per colony: 0,
1±5, 6±50, and >50. an lfc was de®ned as a colony containing more than
®ve oil red o-staining cells, i.e., those with fused lipid droplets equivalent
to a mid- or late-differentiated stage of sebocyte development.
statistical analysis one-way analysis of variance followed by fisher's
protected least differences post hoc testing was used to compare the various
treatments. statistical analyses were performed using the statview program,
and a p-value (two-tailed) < 0.05 was considered statistically signi®cant.

results
effect of atra and selective rar agonists on sebocyte
growth as shown in fig 1(a, b), atra,  xxxd77xxx  (a selective
rar-b,g agonist), cd2043 (a selective rar pan-agonist), and
cd336 (a selective rar-a agonist), all of which activate rars,
inhibited cell number and colony growth in a dose-dependent
manner. subtle differences were noted  xxxd1891xxx ±6 m, however. atra
showed a clear dose-related inhibitory effect to a maximum of
approximately 20% of control values  xxxd1891xxx ±6 m, but cd2043 and
cd336  xxxd1891xxx ±6 m showed no more inhibitory effect than  xxxd1891xxx ±8 m
and 10±7 m, respectively. in contrast,  xxxd77xxx  completely
obliterated cell proliferation  xxxd1891xxx ±6 m.  xxxd77xxx  was then tested
in combination with cd336  xxxd1891xxx ±7 m and 10±6 m in a separate set
of experiments (n = 4, not shown) to determine whether the
profound inhibitory effect of the high dose rar-b,g agonist
would be prevented by the selective rar-a agonist. the
combination showed no evidence of interaction between the
rar-a and rar-b,g agonists, neither additive nor inhibitory,
and no growth occurred in any incubations with  xxxd77xxx   xxxd1891xxx ±6
m.
effect of atra and selective rar agonists on sebocyte
differentiation approximately 20% of untreated colonies were
differentiated.  xxxd1891xxx ±8 m, atra,  xxxd77xxx , and cd2043
inhibited the percent lfcs to approximately one-half of control
values (p < 0.01 versus control) (fig 1c). in a different set of
experiments cd336 also signi®cantly inhibited sebocyte
differentiation. as with growth, some clear differences were
noted among treatments  xxxd1891xxx ±6 m. with atra 10±6 m, the
smaller number of remaining colonies seemed to become
signi®cantly more differentiated than controls (42.2% 6 4.0%
lfcs, mean 6 sem). some differentiation also seemed to occur,
although to a lesser degree, in response to cd2043 10±6 m, at
which dose the percent lfcs returned to control levels. in both
cases the absolute number of lfcs per well (17.1 6 2.9 and
13.8 6 4.1, respectively) remained below the control level
(30.4 6 5.2, p < 0.01). regardless of the degree of differentiation,
however, the cells treated with rar agonists looked distorted and
®broblast-like (fig 2).

discussion
we have investigated the role of speci®c retinoid receptors and
their subtypes in sebocyte growth and differentiation using the rat
preputial cell monolayer culture system (rosen®eld et al, 1999).
the expression of retinoid receptors is tissue speci®c, and sebaceous
glands as well as skin express predominantly rar-g and rxr-a
in mice and humans (zelent et al, 1989; finzi et al, 1992; reichrath
et al, 1995). expression of rar-a and rar-b, as well as rar-g
and rxr-a, have also been reported in cultured human sebocytes
at the mrna level (doran et al, 1991).
first, we looked at the effects of selective agonists for rars and
their subtypes on sebocyte growth and differentiation. we found
that all speci®c rar agonists including selective rar-a and
rar-b,g agonists inhibited both sebocyte growth and differentiation, and their maximum inhibitory effect on differentiation was
seen at a lower dose than the dose required for maximum inhibition
of proliferation. furthermore, the inhibitory effects of low doses of
the rar pan-agonist and the rar-b,g agonist were normalized
by an rar-b,g antagonist. these ®ndings suggest that rars,
especially the b and/or g subtypes, mediate both antiproliferative

and antidifferentiative effects of retinoids. interestingly, unlike
other rar agonists, the rar-b,g agonist  xxxd77xxx  completely
obliterated cell growth and, consequently, differentiation at high
dosage. since rar-a agonist itself inhibited both sebocyte growth
and differentiation and did not protect against this effect of
 xxxd77xxx , micromolar  xxxd77xxx  may cause apoptosis of sebocytes,
as it does in other cells (unpublished data).
in contrast to the selective rar agonists, the selective rxr
agonist enhanced both proliferation and differentiation of sebocytes. the rxr stimulatory effect was more obvious on
differentiation than proliferation  xxxd1891xxx ±6 m. it is possible that a
proliferative effect of rxr may be masked by its marked
differentiative effect at high dose, since cell differentiation is
typically not compatible with proliferation (hu et al, 1996; lacasa
et al, 1997). on the other hand, sebocytes may be an exception to
this rule since differentiating sebocytes seem to retain some capacity
to proliferate (rosen®eld, 1989; zouboulis, 1996). further work
with a selective rxr antagonist is indicated to clarify the role of
rxr in sebocyte proliferation and differentiation.
like selective rar agonists, the natural rar ligand atra
exerted both antiproliferative and antidifferentiative effects at low
dose (10±8 m), and both of these suppressive effects were also
reversed by an rar-b,g antagonist. zouboulis and coworkers
demonstrated a similar inhibitory effect of atra on proliferation
at concentrations between 10±8 m and 10±5 m and lipid synthesis at
10±7 m in cultured human sebocytes (zouboulis et al, 1991). we
found that the atra effect at high dose was notably different,
however, from that of other rar agonists on differentiation:
atra 10±6 m paradoxically seemed to enhance differentiation of
the small number of remaining colonies. it is possible that cell
degeneration and autophagocytosis of membrane lipids contributes
to this appearance. alternatively, this effect may be related to the
potential for atra to be metabolized to an rxr ligand. atra
has been shown to be capable of stimulating the transcriptional
activity of rxrs via its isomerization to 9-cis ra in vivo and in vitro
(heyman et al, 1992; zhang et al, 1992b). taken together, we
deduce that rars probably mediate the antiproliferative and
antidifferentiative effects of atra at low dose, whereas the
differentiative effect of high dose atra may be mediated by
rxr via its conversion to 9-cis ra.
although rar- and rxr-selective retinoids have shown
distinct biologic effects on different types of cells, including
sebocytes as this study shows, the mechanisms underlying the
divergent effects of rar and rxr activation are not entirely clear
(howell et al, 1998; lomo et al, 1998). it has been suggested that
they activate divergent signaling pathways. the effect of rar and
rxr ligands in other systems depends in part on the direct liganddependent stimulation of the rar:rxr heterodimer and
rxr:rxr homodimer signaling pathways, and/or in part on
the relative rar or rxr predominance. rxr predominance
not only favors the latter of these two retinoid signaling pathways,
but also makes rxr available to other partner receptors, such as
ppar (kurokawa et al, 1994; hembree et al, 1996; joseph et al,
1998). ppars are of special interest, since we found that ppar
agonists can induce sebocyte differentiation (rosen®eld et al, 1999),
probably via heterodimerization with rxr as shown to be the case
with adipocytes (wahli et al, 1995; tontonoz et al, 1996), and an
rxr ligand alone can activate the rxr:ppar heterodimer
(kliewer et al, 1992b).
in summary, we here demonstrate that selective rar and rxr
ligands exert distinct effects on sebocyte growth and differentiation.
our results suggest that rars, especially the b and/or g subtypes,
mediate both the antiproliferative and antidifferentiative effects of
retinoids, whereas rxrs mediate both clear differentiative and
minor proliferative effects on sebocytes in culture. these ®ndings
have implications for better understanding of the role of speci®c
retinoid receptors in the pathogenesis of acne as well as in
regulation of normal sebocyte development, and further indicate

the potential for improved therapies for various skin disorders such
as acne vulgaris.
