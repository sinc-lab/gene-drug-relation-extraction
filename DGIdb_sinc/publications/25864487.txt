introduction: the evidence base for disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs
used in psoriatic arthritis (psa) is surprisingly weak, with most having little
robust evidence to support their clinical use. furthermore, there remain safety
and tolerability concerns with both these and more recently available biological therapies.  xxxd202xxx , a novel, small molecule, represents the first oral
therapy specifically developed for psa.
areas covered: this review describes the pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd202xxx  and available data demonstrating significant benefits to both clinical
and histological features of inflammatory arthritis. the key findings from a
large phase iii clinical program will also be discussed, including short- and
long-term efficacy outcomes and, importantly, the safety profile. indications
other than psa will also be briefly reviewed. given the recent nature of
much of the data, published literature as well as information available only
in the abstract format are included in this review.
expert opinion: studies show that treatment with  xxxd202xxx  results in significant improvement in both skin psoriasis and psa symptoms.  xxxd202xxx  has
been approved by both the united states fda and european medicines
agency for treatment of psa. use of this medication is recommended in active
psa patients, according to local licensing.

psoriatic arthritis

psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition, which is characterized by hyperproliferation of keratinocytes producing a thickened epidermis with infiltration of
mononuclear cells [1]. psoriatic arthritis (psa) is an inflammatory arthritis that
occurs in around 20 -- 30% of patients with skin psoriasis [2,3]. the estimated prevalence of psa is 0.3 -- 1.0% of the adult general population [2]. in > 80% of psa
patients, skin features precede the arthritic manifestation by a decade or more [4].
however, in a minority, the inflammatory arthritis begins first, making the diagnosis more difficult. psa causes synovitis in peripheral joints as well as inflammation in
the axial skeleton including sacroiliac joints. other manifestations such as dactylitis,
enthesitis and anterior uveitis or iritis are also common [5]. psa patients are typically
sero-negative for the presence of rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated
peptide antibodies; however, there is a greater chance of sero-positivity in psa
patients compared with the general population [6]. the common conventional treatment agents in psa include nsaid, intra-articular steroid injections if a single joint
is affected, and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (dmards) such as methotrexate,  xxxd3255xxx ,  xxxd2450xxx  and cyclosporin [7-12]. surprisingly, considering
the widespread use, the effectiveness of these medications has not been well established in clinical studies [13]. moreover, the use of these drugs has been associated
with safety, tolerability and drug interaction issues [14-16]. more recently, biologic
dmards, particularly tnf inhibitors (tnfi) have been licensed for the treatment

of psa. these include etanercept [17], adalimumab [18],  xxxd2224xxx  [19], infliximab [20] and  xxxd462xxx  [21]. these
tnfi produce significant improvements in psa disease activity; however, concerns regarding their cost, safety and tolerability limit their applications [22]. moreover, a proportion
of patients do not respond to either conventional or
biologic dmards. a number of new biological therapies
for psa have either recently been approved (e.g., the
il-12/23 inhibitor ustekinumab) or are currently being
developed (e.g., the  xxxg1166xxx  inhibitor  xxxd3185xxx ). however,
small molecule, oral medications that alter intracellular signaling pathways are also generating interest, including a recently
approved medication,  xxxd202xxx  (box 1).

 xxxd202xxx 

 xxxd202xxx  is a novel, orally administered inhibitor of the
intracellular enzyme,  xxxg1697xxx  (pde4). it has a
low molecular weight of 460.5 g [23] and works by binding
to the catalytic site of the pde4 enzyme thereby blocking
the degradation of camp, leading to down regulation of
pro-inflammatory markers [24]. in 2014  xxxd202xxx  was
approved by the united states fda for the treatment of adult
patients with active psa and for patients with moderate-severe
plaque psoriasis [25].  xxxd202xxx  has since been approved for
use in one or both of these indications in multiple countries,
including canada and the european union [26].

mechanism of action of  xxxd202xxx 
camp is an intracellular secondary messenger that plays an
important role in the regulation of many biological activities,
including inflammation [23,27]. pdes are the enzymes that
degrade and hydrolyze camp [28]. pde4 is an enzyme that
is expressed in a tissue-specific distribution [29], degrading
camp in inflammatory cells, vascular endothelial cells,
smooth muscle cells, keratinocytes, chondrocytes and the central nervous system cells [30-32]. hence, pde4 regulates the
pro-inflammatory actions of t cells, neutrophils, dendritic
cells, monocytes, macrophages and eosinophils (figure 1)
[24,33,34]. in t cells, the main role of pde4 activity in signal
transduction is through its association with the cross-ligation
of cd28 and t-cell receptor [35], which influences the production of cytokines such as  xxxg2296xxx , ifn-g, il-2, il-4,
 xxxg1180xxx  and proliferation of t-lymphocyte [36,37]. in neutrophils,
pde4 inhibits the production of il-8 and leukotriene b4;
both of these autocrine chemotactic factors are needed for
neutrophils chemotaxis to inflamed tissues [38]. pde4 is
involved in the production of superoxide anions, which
enable degranulation and chemotaxis of neutrophils. it also
facilitates the adhesion of neutrophils to vascular wall endothelium by inducing the expression of the b2-integrin
 xxxg1206xxx   xxxg1209xxx  [30,39]. neutrophils and dendritic cells are also dependent on growth and differentiation factor, gm-csf production, which can be inhibited by pde4 inhibitors [40]. in
addition, monocytes and macrophages are important producers of the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as  xxxg2296xxx ,

figure 1.  xxxd202xxx  specifically targets pde4 and modulates expression of a network of pro-inflammatory and antiinflammatory mediators. the inflammatory process in psoriasis and arthritis results from an interplay between innate immune
cells (dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils), adaptive immune cells (t cells), and even non-immune cells
(keratinocytes, synovial fibroblasts, and chondrocytes). the production of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators
is modulated in these cell types through the enzyme pde4. pro-inflammatory signals such as those emanating from the
tlr4 pathway in cells such as monocytes and dendritic cells result in activation of the transcription factor  xxxg1559xxx  and the
expression of pro-inflammatory mediators such as  xxxd3038xxx ,  xxxg2296xxx , and ifn-g. simultaneously, signals emanating from gpcrs such
as those binding pg act via the stimulatory gas to activate ac, resulting in production of camp. in white blood cells such as
monocytes and dendritic cells, camp is degraded to amp largely through hydrolysis by pde4. pde4 inhibition by  xxxd202xxx 
increases camp levels within the cells, which results in activation of pka, as well as cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels, or the
exchange protein activated by camp(epac). pka activation results in phosphorylation of the cre binding family of
transcription factors, including creb, crem, and atf-1. in certain cell types such as monocytes, these factors bind to cre sites
within promoters of genes such as il-10, resulting in increased gene expression. cre-driven transcriptional activation recruits
coactivators such as cbp or the homologous protein p300, which have histone acetyl transferase activity. recruitment of cbp
and p300 away from  xxxg1559xxx  results in inhibition of  xxxg1559xxx  transcriptional activity, and a reduction in  xxxg1559xxx -dependent gene
expression, thereby resulting in a decrease in  xxxd3038xxx ,  xxxg2296xxx , and ifn-g production. the decreased inflammatory response may
lead to lower levels of infiltration by other immune cells, as well as reduced activation and proliferation of keratinocytes and
synoviocytes. together, this may lead to decreased epidermal thickening in psoriasis and decreased synovial damage in
arthritis.

il-12 and  xxxd3038xxx , levels of which are regulated by pde4 and
reduced by pde4 inhibitors [36,37,41]. in eosinophils, processes
such as degranulation and chemotaxis are also regulated by
pde4 [42].
 xxxd202xxx  is a highly selective pde4 inhibitor. studies
have shown that it was ~ 279 -- 40,000 times more selective
for pde4 enzyme inhibition than for other pde enzymes.
using  xxxd202xxx  causes inhibition of pde4 enzyme and as

a result, degradation of camp is prevented. this causes
increased levels of camp in pde4-expressing cells, which
prevents synthesis of many pro-inflammatory markers
including  xxxg2296xxx , ifn-g, interleukins and chemokines
(e.g., cxcl9,  xxxg559xxx  and ccl4) [37,43]. elevation of
camp in human keratinocytes after use of pde4 inhibitors
such as  xxxd202xxx  might explain some of the pathophysiological response of psoriasis to these medications.

elevation of camp by using a pde4 inhibitor causes activation of the  xxxg1836xxx  (pka) pathway and restores the
csk/lck inhibitory axis [23]. these phosphorylate the camp
response element-binding protein (creb) transcription
factor, thereby inducing transcription of genes including
il-10 and il-6. however,  xxxg2296xxx  expression is determined
primarily by the transcription factor of  xxxg1559xxx . the latter
mechanism is inhibited by camp elevation because of the
competition between creb and the  xxxg1559xxx  p65 subunit
to engage the  xxxg516xxx , which binds directly
to the tata box (a dna sequence in the promoter region
of the relevant gene) and commences transcription [44,45].
therefore, elevation of camp inhibits  xxxg1559xxx -dependent
gene transcription while augmenting creb-dependent gene
expression. in summary, the mechanism of inhibition of
pde4 is through camp, pka pathway, and nf-kbdependent mechanisms [46-49].
pharmacodynamic analysis of plasma samples taken during
the phase iii palace program in psa supports the mechanism of action with effects observed on several inflammatory
cytokines. treatment with  xxxd202xxx  for 4 -- 24 weeks was
associated with significant reductions in circulating levels of
il-8,  xxxg2296xxx , and il-6, representing components of proinflammatory innate th1 immunity. logistic regression
analyses indicated that clinical responses correlated with the
percent changes in  xxxg2296xxx . after 40 weeks, there was
significant inhibition of il-6,  xxxd3038xxx , and  xxxg1166xxx  levels, and significant increases in il-10 levels, suggesting that long-term
 xxxd202xxx  therapy inhibits components of the systemic
th17 immune response [50].

pharmacokinetics of  xxxd202xxx 
after oral administration of  xxxd202xxx  20 mg once daily
(q.d.), a mean steady-state maximal concentration (cmax) of
207 ng/ml was seen. the median time of maximal concentration (tmax) was reached at 2 h. the mean half-life of
the drug was 8.2 h. regarding excretion of the drug, the
mean clearance was 10.4 l/h [51]. unlike biological tnfi
medications, which bind directly to soluble  xxxg2296xxx  and neutralize it at the protein level,  xxxd202xxx  causes modulation,
that is, broad but not complete inhibition of production of
multiple pro-inflammatory mediators, including  xxxg2296xxx , at
the level of gene expression [24]. it has been reported that
the binding affinity of  xxxd202xxx  for pde4 is at least
7900-folds lower than the binding affinity of tnfi medication for soluble tnf [52]. in their phase ii clinical trial,
gottlieb et al. showed that at day 29,  xxxd202xxx  significantly
inhibits  xxxg2296xxx  production [51]. in vivo lipopolysaccharide
stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells indicated
that an  xxxd202xxx  concentration of ~ 1 µm was associated
with ~ 75% inhibition of  xxxg2296xxx  production compared to
control [37], therefore suggesting that unlike tnfi,  xxxd202xxx  does not completely suppress  xxxg2296xxx  production.

use of  xxxd202xxx 
 xxxd202xxx  in psoriasis and psa

2.3.1

the pathophysiology of psoriasis involves t cells, neutrophils,
dendritic cells and monocytes, all of which contribute to the
proliferation of abnormal keratinocytes [1]. in psoriasis,
pde4 is present in all the important inflammatory cells
involved in the pathophysiological process. therefore, pde4
inhibition appears to be an ideal target to inhibit production
of pro-inflammatory cytokines in this context [23,38,53]. studies
have shown that in patients with skin psoriasis,  xxxd202xxx  can
inhibit  xxxg2296xxx  production in ultraviolet-treated keratinocytes
and does not affect the proliferation of normal keratinocytes [23]. some studies have utilized injection of natural killer
cells from psoriatic patient donors in to healthy skin to produce classical psoriasis histology [37,54]. in their study,
schafer et al. used  xxxd202xxx  in these models and their results
showed significant reduction in epidermal thickness and proliferation, and a decrease in the general feature of skin psoriasis, as well as suppression of  xxxg2296xxx , icam-1, and human
leukocyte antigen-dr in the skin lesion [37]. gottlieb et al.
performed a small, open-label, single-arm pilot study in
patients with severe plaque-type psoriasis and treated them
with  xxxd202xxx  20 mg q.d. for 29 days. they found changes
in both skin and blood biomarkers. their results showed
that, overall, the patients demonstrated a mean decrease of
20.5% in epidermal thickness at day 29, and the majority
(73.7%) of their patients reported improvement in psoriasis
symptoms according to psoriasis area and severity index
(pasi) scoring. furthermore, significant reductions in the
epidermal and dermal t cells and  xxxg1208xxx  cells were noticed.
there was also a significant reduction in the mrna level of
inducible  xxxd2738xxx  synthetase within the skin biopsy [51].
subsequently, several phase ii studies were done using
different doses of  xxxd202xxx  and more importantly different
patient populations. in a phase iib, multicentre, randomized,
placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study, 352 patients were
randomized to one of four groups:  xxxd202xxx  in 10, 20, or
30 mg each dosed twice per day or placebo. their results
showed that both  xxxd202xxx  20 and 30 mg were significantly
different from placebo in the achievement of end point of
75% reduction in the pasi score (pasi-75) whereas with
 xxxd202xxx  10 mg, the difference from placebo was not significant [55]. the patient-reported outcomes were also assessed in
these individuals and it has been reported that those
on  xxxd202xxx  had improved health-related quality of life,
including improvements in dermatology life quality index
scores and pruritus visual analog scale after 16 weeks of treatment [56]. in another phase ii, multicentre, double-blind placebo-controlled study, the same group showed that at the end
of 12 weeks, 24.4% of subjects receiving  xxxd202xxx  20 mg
twice per day achieved pasi-75 compared to 10.3% receiving
placebo (p = 0.023). the mean per cent reduction in pasi
from the baseline was 52.1% in the group taking  xxxd202xxx 
20 mg twice per day whereas it was only 17.4% in the placebo

 xxxd202xxx 

group (p < 0.001) [57]. more recently in another phase ii multicentre open-label study, 30 patients with plaque psoriasis
received oral  xxxd202xxx  20 mg twice per day and were assessed
in four phases: pre-treatment, treatment, extension, and
observational. at week 12 patients with ‡ pasi-75 continued
treatment and patients with < pasi-75 were given a higher
dose of  xxxd202xxx  with 30 mg twice per day through week
24. at week 12, 67% of patients had a ‡ 1-point improvement in static physician’s global assessment, meeting the
treatment effect criterion. the mean improvement seen in
the pasi score was -59% and in the body surface area was
-53% [58].
in inflammatory arthropathies such as psa, there is
substantial influx of immune cells, including macrophage,
monocytes, neutrophils and lymphocytes, into the joints.
additionally there is synovial hyperplasia due to synovial
fibroblast-like cell proliferation. these two mechanisms
increase production of cytokines in the affected joints and
enhance the inflammatory process [23]. the pde4 inhibitor,
 xxxd202xxx , has been assessed in several studies in psa. in a
study, experimental arthritis was induced by monoclonal antibody against type 2 collagen in balb/c mice. in this study
 xxxd202xxx  with an oral dose of 25 mg/kg significantly reduced
synovial inflammation, bone erosion and cartilage damage.
moreover, at a lower dose of 5 mg/kg, significant inhibition
of paw swelling was also observed. these results confirmed
reduction in both clinical and histological signs of inflammatory arthritis after  xxxd202xxx  treatment [59]. schett et al. conducted a phase ii, multicentre, double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled study where they examined the efficacy
and safety of  xxxd202xxx  in patients with psa. subjects with
joint involvement of at least 6 months duration and with
three tender and swollen joints were recruited into the study.
two hundred and four subjects were randomized in a
1:1:1 ratio to receive placebo or oral  xxxd202xxx  20 mg twice
per day or 40 mg once per day for 12 weeks (12-week treatment phase). at week 12, placebo patients were rerandomized to receive  xxxd202xxx  20 mg twice per day or
40 mg once per day until week 24 (12-week treatmentextension phase). after 12 weeks, 43.5% of patients receiving
 xxxd202xxx  20 mg twice per day (p < 0.001) and 35.8% receiving  xxxd202xxx  40 mg once per day (p = 0.002) achieved the
primary endpoint of acr20, compared with 11.8% of those
receiving placebo. at the end of the treatment extension phase
(week 24), > 40% of patients in each group achieved the
acr20 level of improvement [60].
a large phase iii clinical program in psa has been
conducted (palace program) consisting of three separate
randomized, placebo-controlled studies in patients with an
inadequate response to prior dmard therapy [61-63] and
one study in patients naive to dmard treatment [64]. in all
studies, compared to placebo,  xxxd202xxx  demonstrated
significantly higher acr20 responses at week 16 (primary
endpoint) together with significant improvements in secondary measures including physical function (measured by the

health assessment questionnaire--disability index score),
sf-36 physical function, eular responses and
das-28 ( xxxg520xxx ) remission (< 2.6). in patients
with active psoriasis (‡ 3% body surface area)  xxxd202xxx 
treatment was also associated with significantly higher proportion of patients achieving a pasi-50 response. in the
palace 1 study 504 patients were randomized 1:1:1 to
receive placebo,  xxxd202xxx  20 mg twice a day or 30 mg twice
a day. by week 16, 31 and 40% of patients taking  xxxd202xxx 
20 mg twice a day and  xxxd202xxx  30 mg twice a day achieved
arc20 compared to only 19% in the placebo group
(p = 0.0141 and p = 0.0001 respectively) [63].  xxxd202xxx 
also demonstrated significant efficacy across a range of subgroups based on prior treatments, including those only previously treated with small molecule dmards and patients
with prior biologic exposure, albeit with reduced overall
responses in this more treatment refractory population [63].
a summary of key outcomes from palace 1 is provided
in table 1 [63].
importantly, a pooled analysis across the palace
phase iii program demonstrated that in patients with preexisting enthesitis,  xxxd202xxx  significantly improved outcomes using the maastricht  xxxg1055xxx  enthesitis
score (mases) compared to placebo [65]. similarly, in
patients with pre-existing dactylitis,  xxxd202xxx  significantly
reduced the dactylitis count [65].
long-term follow-up of those patients taking  xxxd202xxx  by
week 52 showed persistence of benefit in which 59% of
patients met the acr20, although smaller numbers of
patients met acr50 or 70 [66]. furthermore, the improvements observed in mases and dactylitis counts were
maintained over a 1-year period with clearance of these symptoms (i.e., mases score or dactylitis count of zero) in 38.2%
of patients with pre-existing enthesopathy and 63.3% of
patients with pre-existing dactylitis [63,65].
 xxxd202xxx  in other inflammatory conditions
 xxxd202xxx  has been studied in other inflammatory conditions
including behçet’s syndrome,  xxxg1055xxx  and
rheumatoid arthritis. in a phase ii, multicentre, randomized
placebo-controlled trial, conducted by hatemi et al.,  xxxd202xxx  significantly reduced both the number of mouth ulcers
and genital ulcers of patients with behçet’s syndrome after
12 weeks treatment [67]. a pilot phase ii study in rheumatoid
arthritis has not been fully reported; however a celgene press
release indicated that the primary endpoint (acr20) was not
achieved. a phase iii study in  xxxg1055xxx  was also
reported not to have achieved its primary endpoint
(asas20 response); however, this study remains ongoing
and further data are anticipated.
there is pre-clinical evidence to support the potential role
of  xxxd202xxx  in further inflammatory conditions.  xxxd202xxx 
showed anti-inflammatory effects in inflammatory bowel diseases. in lamina propria mononuclear cells, isolated from the
gut mucosa of ulcerative colitis or crohn’s disease patients,

on the efficacy of other pde4 medications for treatment of
other inflammatory conditions. examples include arofylline,
 xxxd1697xxx  and  xxxd3140xxx  in chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease,  xxxd3140xxx  in asthma, and tetomilast in ulcerative
colitis [69-71].

safety of  xxxd202xxx 
 xxxd202xxx  appears to be generally well tolerated and discontinuation is uncommon. side effects such as diarrhea and
nausea were more commonly observed in patients treated
with  xxxd202xxx  than with placebo. other gastrointestinal
symptoms such as vomiting and abdominal pain were not
uncommon and considered as side effects of pde4 inhibitors [72]. in their clinical trial, schett et al. showed that
most patients in the treatment phase and treatment extension
phase reported at least one adverse event, most commonly
reported as diarrhea, headache, nausea, fatigue and
nasopharyngitis. however, most events were mild to moderate and no clinically significant laboratory or electrocardiographic abnormalities were recorded [60]. during clinical
studies, weight loss of 5 -- 10% of body weight was reported
in 10% of patients. the mechanism for this weight loss is
unknown. the us prescribing information also notes a
potential risk of depression, although the incidence of this
in patients receiving  xxxd202xxx  was similar to that reported
in patients receiving placebo. importantly, two patients
receiving placebo committed suicide compared to none in
the  xxxd202xxx  groups.

 xxxd202xxx  does not have any marked pde4 subtype selectivity, which may explain its improved therapeutic index and
favorable side effect profile, for example emesis in  xxxd1697xxx  [73] and central nervous system effects in  xxxd3142xxx  [59].
 xxxd202xxx  was also assessed in both renal and hepatic impairments and was found to be well tolerated in patients with
mild renal impairment [23].  xxxd202xxx  and its metabolite
were not shown to cause adverse effects in patient with
moderate to severe hepatic impairment. whereas dosage
adjustment is not considered necessary for patients with
hepatic impairment, a dose reduction to 30 mg q.d. is advised
in patients with severe renal impairment (patients with creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) [74]. in the palace 1 clinical
trial, 24 weeks treatment with  xxxd202xxx  was not associated
with significant side effects such as major adverse cardiac
events, serious infections (including opportunistic), or malignancies. there was also no evidence of clinically significant
laboratory abnormalities, which suggested that routine laboratory monitoring may not be required when using this medication [63]. these data have also been supported by pooled
longer term safety analyses from the palace program.
whereas the safety of  xxxd202xxx  in combination with other
therapies has not been specifically investigated, it should be
considered that > 60% of patients in the palace clinical trials received  xxxd202xxx  in addition to background dmard
therapy (predominantly methotrexate) [63], thereby indicating
that such combinations appear well tolerated. whereas the
safety data for  xxxd202xxx  appear to be encouraging, it should
be recognized that the data generated to date come only from
clinical trials and are of relatively short-term exposure
(1 -- 2 years). it is therefore important that real life experience
with  xxxd202xxx  is collected over the long term so that these
safety data can be confirmed.

conclusion

 xxxd202xxx  has demonstrated efficacy when compared to
placebo in phase i, ii, and iii trials for treatment of psoriasis
and psa, preceded by convincing animal and histopathological research. throughout its development, safety and tolerability have been shown to be favorable compared to current
available therapies including dmards and biologics.
whereas further information is required comparing efficacy
of  xxxd202xxx  directly against that of current treatments, the
emergence of a new class of drug where the alternatives are
expensive, poorly tolerated and sometimes dangerous is most
welcome in the field. available information supports the
conclusion that in many patients with psa,  xxxd202xxx  would
seem an appropriate choice of therapy.

expert opinion

psa is a chronic inflammatory arthritis that most commonly
occurs in patients with skin psoriasis. currently used
treatments include nsaid, corticosteroids, and dmard
medications. in the last decade, biologic agents, especially
tnfi, have also been licensed for treatment of psa. these
drugs have resulted in significant improvements in the treatment of psa. however, there are still patients who fail to
respond to classical dmards or tnfi or in whom treatment
loses efficacy over time. these medications have also been
associated with safety and drug interaction issues. furthermore, the biologic drugs in particular are high cost and
some patients may find the way of taking the drug by intravenous or subcutaneous administration inconvenient. therefore, a clinical need for newer classes of medication with
different mechanism of action exists. recently there has
been development of an oral anti-psoriatic medication that
specifically interferes with intracellular signaling processes.
 xxxd202xxx  is a new, orally available medication that works
specifically by inhibiting the pde4 enzyme. it has been
reported that use of this medication decreases the release of
pro-inflammatory cytokines and induces anti-inflammatory
cytokines. its use is already approved by the united states
fda for the treatment of psa and skin psoriasis and more
recently has similarly been licensed by the european

medicines agency. clinical trials indicate that treatment
with  xxxd202xxx  resulted in a significant improvement in psoriasis and psa symptoms as determined by pasi-75 responses
or acr20 responses. these studies have included a wide spectrum of patients with active psa, including those who had
previously treated with dmard and/or tnfi. however, it
should be noted that no data on the ability of  xxxd202xxx  to
inhibit structural joint damage is currently available. overall,
 xxxd202xxx  with its favorable safety profile and its efficacy data
can be considered in the treatment of patients with psa,
especially those with moderated disease activity and those
patients for whom the safety profile of the drug will affect
their choice of treatment. therefore, we would recommend
the use of  xxxd202xxx  in psa patients primarily immediately
after methotrexate and before biologics. in addition, however,
depending on local licensing, it can also be used as the first
line, for patients who have a contraindication to, or are intolerant of, or who are unable or unwilling to take methotrexate,
as well as in biologic failures.
in patients on  xxxd202xxx  who have developed side effects,
these have been generally mild and relatively short lasting.
indeed, there are currently no specific monitoring requirements for patients on  xxxd202xxx  unlike patients on traditional
disease monitoring drugs or biologics. specifically, pretreatment screening for latent tuberculosis is not required.
further studies should be carried out in patients taking these
new medications. the mechanism and causes of non-response
or a loss of response to the medication need to be investigated
in detail. safety profiles and advantages of combination therapy have to be studied in more detail. the development of
more safe and effective medication for psa will continue.
