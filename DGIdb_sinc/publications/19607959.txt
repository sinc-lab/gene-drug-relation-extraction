methamphetamine (map), a drug of abuse known worldwide for its addictive
evects and neurotoxicity, causes somatic and psychiatric disorders. map enters
terminals/neurons via monoamine transporters, displaces both vesicular and
intracellular monoamines, and facilitates the release of monoamines into the
extraneuronal space through synaptic transport via the monoamine transporters.
chronic psychostimulant abusers exhibit psychotic features, including delusions
and auditory hallucinations. the  xxxg2149xxx  (dat) and the vesicular
 xxxg2099xxx  2 (vmat2) play pivotal roles in the action of map,
including locomotor evects. the deletion of dat attenuates the locomotor evects
of map and may play larger role in behavioral responses to map compared to the
deletion of vmat2. map produces hyperthermia and/or neuronal toxicity in
most species. the evects of map in dat or serotonin transporter ( xxxg2150xxx ) single
knockout (ko) mice and dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice suggested that dat and
 xxxg2150xxx  are key molecules for hyperthermia and neuronal toxicity of map.

i. introduction

methamphetamine (map) is a psychostimulant that induces enhanced arousal
and euphoria acutely, and psychosis and addiction chronically. map enters the
terminals/neuron via the monoamine transporters ( xxxg2149xxx : dat,
serotonin transporter:  xxxg2150xxx , or  xxxg1505xxx   xxxg2148xxx : net), displaces

both vesicular and intracellular monoamines, and facilitates release of monoamines into the extraneuronal space by synaptic transport in the monoamine
transporters (seiden et al., 1993). the large release of monoamine produced by
psychostimulant is thought to contribute to the drug’s evects in the brain.

ii. map-induced behavioral sensitization

the acute and chronic pharmacological consequences of map in human
users have been observed in behavioral experiments in animals, including both
hyperactivity and sensitization of locomotor responses (segal and schuckit, 1983).
behavioral sensitization is a phenomenon whereby repeated intermittent exposure to map-like psychostimulant elicits a progressive enhancement of those
responses, which persists for extended time periods following withdrawal from
the drug and are easily reinstated by exposure to the drug or psychosocial stress
(robinson and becker, 1986). this process closely resembles the course of the
relapse in map-induced psychosis or schizophrenia, thus sensitization in animals
has been suggested to model these psychoses (sato et al., 1983). behavioral
sensitization is thought to be an early and enduring manifestation of neuronal
plasticity associated with changes in mesolimbic dopamine neurotransmission
(kalivas et al., 1993). map induces dopamine release through exchange divusion
of plasma membrane dat (seiden et al., 1993), and release of vesicular dopamine
into the cytosol by acting on the  xxxg2099xxx  (vmat2)
(sulzer et al., 2005). the dopamine releasing evect of map has been postulated to
mediate its locomotor stimulant and rewarding evects (white and kalivas, 1998).
therefore, dat and vmat2 should play pivotal roles in the mechanisms
underlying the actions of map.
dat knockout (ko) mice and vmat2 ko mice have been used to investigate the roles of dat and vmat2 in dopamine neurotransmission and pharmacological mechanisms underlying the actions of psychostimulants. homozygous
deletion of the dat gene has been reported to produce a 10-fold increase (shen
et al., 2004) or fivefold elevation (jones et al., 1998) of extracellular dopamine
concentrations in the striatum measured by in vivo microdialysis, while heterozygous deletion of dat was not found to significantly increase extracellular dopamine (shen et al., 2004) or to produce a smaller twofold elevation (jones et al.,
1998) of dopamine in the striatum. homozygous dat ko mice show growth
retardation and hyperactivity, whereas heterozygous dat ko mice did not show
gross abnormalities in either development or baseline behavioral parameters
(sora et al., 1998). habituated homozygous dat ko mice do not show any
significant cocaine-induced increase in locomotion (sora et al., 1998, 2001;
uhl et al., 2002).

we examined locomotor activity and sensitization in heterozygous dat ko
(datþ/), heterozygous vmat2 ko (vmat2þ/), double heterozygous
dat/vmat2 ko (datþ/ vmat2þ/), and wild-type (wt) mice to evaluate
the roles of dat and vmat2 in map-induced locomotor behavior (fukushima
et al., 2007). in datþ/ vmat2þ/ mice, all of map-induced behavioral
responses were similar to those in datþ/, but not vmat2þ/ mice. the
behavioral evects of both acute and chronic map administration were suppressed
in heterozygous dat ko mice, whether or not it was combined with heterozygous vmat2 ko. contrary to the evect observed in heterozygous dat ko
mice, acute map administration produced greater locomotor responses in heterozygous vmat2 ko mice. these findings indicate that the half deletion of
dat plays a major role in both acute and chronic behavioral responses to map,
while the evect of the half deletion of vmat2 is less prominent.

iii. map-induced hyperthermia and neuronal toxicity

map abuse causes serious health hazards including irreversible neuronal
degeneration, seizures, hyperthermia, and death in human and experimental
animals (davidson et al., 2001). among these side evects, map produces hyperthermia and/or dopaminergic neurotoxicity in most species. clinical reports and
animal studies indicate that lethality by map closely correlates with hyperthermia, which may be the primary cause of death. animal studies suggest that
dopamine receptor activation is crucial for map-induced hyperthermia
(broening et al., 2005) and lethality (bronstein and hong, 1995). there has also
been an assumption that the hyperthermia that follows map administration is
 xxxg1108xxx   xxxg1110xxx   xxxg1113xxx   xxxg1114xxx   xxxg1115xxx   xxxg1117xxx   xxxg1119xxx -mediated (green et al., 2003).
we examined hyperthermic and lethal toxic evects of map in dat,  xxxg2150xxx ,
and dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice to elucidate the role of these two transporters
in map-induced hyperthermia and lethality (numachi et al., 2007). map caused
significant hyperthermia even in the mice with a single dat gene copy and no
 xxxg2150xxx  copies (datþ/  xxxg2150xxx / mice). mice with no dat copies and a single
 xxxg2150xxx  gene copy (dat/ sertþ/ mice) showed significant but reduced
hyperthermia when compared to wt mice after map. these results demonstrate
that map exerts a hyperthermic evect via dat, or via  xxxg2150xxx , in the absence of
dat. dat gene deletion in mice strikingly increased ld50 of map by 1.7–1.8
times that of wt mice, suggesting that the lethal toxic evect of map is mainly
dependent on dat. although dat and  xxxg2150xxx  were shown here to be involved in
both the evects of map on temperature as well as map lethal toxicity, the
mechanisms are nonetheless diverent; dat single ko mice exhibited hyperthermia but greatly reduced map lethality, and the lethality was no diverent from

32

sora et al.

dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice that had hypothermic responses to map. thus,
although the lethal toxic evect of map is mainly dependent on dat, with some
contribution from  xxxg2150xxx , hyperthermia is not prerequisite for map-induced
lethality.
in conclusion, these findings lead us to hypothesize that dat variants may
have more profound evects than vmat2 or  xxxg2150xxx  variants on the clinically
important consequences of acute and chronic map abuse in humans.
