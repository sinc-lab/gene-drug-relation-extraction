an arg/ser substitution in the second  xxxg681xxx -like module of  xxxg752xxx  introduces an o-linked carbohydrate and markedly impairs act...  factor ixr94s is a naturally occurring  xxxg752xxx  defect, which results from an arg 94 to ser mutation in the second  xxxg681xxx  (egf)-like module of  xxxg752xxx . recombinant factor ixr94s was activated by factor xia/calcium with an approximately 50-fold reduced rate and by factor viia/ xxxg748xxx /phospholipid/calcium with an approximately 20-fold reduced rate compared with wild-type  xxxg752xxx . the apparent molecular mass of the light chain of factor ixar94s was approximately 6 kd higher than that of plasma or wild-type  xxxg752xxx , which was not corrected by n-glycosidase f digestion. this result indicated the presence of additional o-linked carbohydrate in the mutant light chain, probably at new ser 94. the initial rate of activation of  xxxg741xxx  by factor ixar94s in the presence of polylysine was 7% +/- 1% of the initial rate of activation of  xxxg741xxx  by plasma factor ixa, and the kc/km for activation of  xxxg741xxx  by factor ixar94s/ xxxg751xxx /phospholipid/calcium was 4% +/- 1% of the kc/km for activation of  xxxg741xxx  by plasma factor ixa/ xxxg751xxx /phospholipid/calcium. the reduced efficiency of activation of  xxxg741xxx  by factor ixar94s in the tenase enzyme complex was due to a 58-fold +/- 12-fold decrease in kcat with little effect on km. in conclusion, the r94s mutation had introduced an o-linked carbohydrate, which markedly impaired both activation by factor xia and turnover of  xxxg741xxx  in the tenase enzyme complex.
