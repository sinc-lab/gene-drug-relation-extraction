importance to vision are thought to be mediated by the ipm,
including visual pigment chromophore exchange, metabolite
trafficking, retinal adhesion, photoreceptor alignment, and
photoreceptor membrane turnover (2–12). because this matrix
resides in such a key location and is putatively crucial in
supporting photoreceptor function, additional information is
required as to the identity, role, and involvement of specific
ipm molecules in mediating these activities.
early attempts to remove ipm components for subsequent
characterization used saline rinses of the outer retinal surface,
which succeeded in isolating some soluble molecules. for example, the interphotoreceptor matrix retinoid-binding protein
was first isolated from the ipm by rinsing, which also removed
a variety of enzymes, some mucins, and immunoglobulins (13–
17). the retention of other less soluble molecules following
aqueous rinses was not initially appreciated but was clearly
documented in the studies of the ipm in xenopus (18) and rat
(19).
recently, an abundant sialoglycoprotein that is retained in
the human ipm following rinsing was characterized and
named spacr (20). a polyclonal antibody prepared against
spacr intensely labels the rod-associated matrix with weaker
labeling of the cone matrix (20). sequence analysis of peptides
from purified spacr revealed 100% identity to the deduced
sequence of interphotoreceptor matrix proteoglycan 1 (genbanktm accession number af047492) cdna (also called
ipm150) (21). the gene product of interphotoreceptor matrix
proteoglycan 1 is listed in genbanktm as a  xxxd1687xxx 
 xxxg612xxx , but our analysis indicates that it is a
glycoprotein and not a proteoglycan (21).
earlier reports document the presence of another prominent
protein in the insoluble ipm. this molecule, initially referred to
as  xxxg1188xxx  (8), is clearly a  xxxg612xxx  because it
will only enter a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel after digestion with
chondroitinase abc (23). furthermore, it shows intense immunoreactivity in western blots to a chondroitin ⌬di6s monoclonal antibody (23). until now the identity of this proteoglycan
has remained unknown. in this study we describe the cloning
and characterization of the human cdna encoding this novel
proteoglycan in addition to the chromosomal localization of the
gene counterpart. the identification of the proteoglycan came
about during cloning attempts of the human homolog of
pg10.2, a gene that is expressed specifically in rat pineal gland
pna, peanut agglutinin; ha, hyaluronan; pcr, polymerase chain reaction; pbs, phosphate-buffered saline; page, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bsa, bovine  xxxg124xxx ; cpc, cetylpyridinium chloride; efemp-1, egf fibrillin-like extracellular matrix protein-1; egf,

name for highly purified ha used in ophthalmic surgery; nonidet p-40,

the interphotoreceptor matrix is a unique extracellular complex occupying the interface between photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium in the fundus of the eye. because of the putative supportive role in
photoreceptor maintenance, it is likely that constituent
molecules play key roles in photoreceptor function and
may be targets for inherited retinal disease. in this
study we identify and characterize  xxxg1188xxx , a novel
chondroitin proteoglycan in this matrix.  xxxg1188xxx 
was cloned from a human retinal cdna library and
the gene localized to chromosome 3q11.2. analysis
of  xxxg1188xxx  mrna and protein revealed that
 xxxg1188xxx  is expressed exclusively by photoreceptors
and pinealocytes.  xxxg1188xxx  synthesized by photoreceptors is localized to the interphotoreceptor matrix
where it surrounds both rods and cones. the functional
protein contains 1160 amino acids with a large central
mucin domain, three consensus sites for glycosaminoglycan attachment, two  xxxg681xxx -like
repeats, a putative hyaluronan-binding motif, and a potential transmembrane domain near the c-terminal.
lectin and western blotting indicate an mr around
400,000 before and 230,000 after chondroitinase abc digestion. removal of n- and o-linked oligosaccharides
reduces the mr to approximately 160,000, suggesting
that approximately 60% of the mass of  xxxg1188xxx  is
carbohydrate. finally, we demonstrate that  xxxg1188xxx 
binds hyaluronan and propose that associations between  xxxg1188xxx  and hyaluronan may be involved in
organization of the insoluble interphotoreceptor matrix, particularly as  xxxg1188xxx  is the major proteoglycan present in this matrix.

 xxxg1188xxx : a novel hyaluronan-binding proteoglycan

and retina (24). the n-terminal sequence of the proteoglycan
core protein isolated from the human ipm matched the deduced amino acid sequence of the human pg10.2 homolog. we
named this gene and its product “ xxxg1188xxx ,” because it is a
novel proteoglycan located in the subretinal space, the term
used by ophthalmologists for the ipm. we document the expression of the  xxxg1188xxx  gene in photoreceptors and pinealocytes and localize  xxxg1188xxx  in the ipm where it surrounds both rods and cones.  xxxg1188xxx  is retained in the
insoluble ipm through its binding to hyaluronan, suggesting
that one function of  xxxg1188xxx  is to participate with the
glycoprotein spacr in binding and organizing hyaluronan into
the primary scaffold of the insoluble ipm (25). finally, there
are homologous regions between the deduced amino acid sequences of human  xxxg1188xxx  and the glycoprotein spacr,
which suggests a novel family of ipm-specific molecules.

tissue sources—the 42 human eyes used in this analysis were
obtained from the cleveland eye bank, cleveland, oh. donor ages
ranged from 14 to 77 years, with postmortem times between 2 and 12 h.
seven human pineal glands with donor ages from 20 to 78 years were
also used; five were obtained through the cooperative human tissue
network at the cleveland clinic foundation, department of anatomic
pathology, and two were from the section of neuropathology, clinical
brain disorders branch, nimh, bethesda, md.
cdna library screen—approximately 1 ⫻ 106 bacteriophage clones
from a ␭gt10 human retinal cdna library (kindly provided by dr.
jeremy nathans, johns hopkins university school of medicine, baltimore, md) were screened (27) using a rat pg10.2 cdna probe. the
cdna probe was derived by pcr using rat pg10.2 sequence-specific
forward (5⬘-tggttttggcccaaatgattatgtttctcc) and reverse
(5⬘-cccagggtggcatttgcactttgc) primers and the rat pg10.2
cdna as the dna template (24). the pcr product was purified using
qiaquick gel extraction kit (qiagen, valencia, ca) and random
primer labeled with [␣-32p]dctp (3000 ci/mmol, icn biomedicals,
aurora, oh) and the prime-it ii kit (stratagene, la jolla, ca) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the nitrocellulose membrane
filters (schleicher & schuell) were prehybridized for 3 h in 5⫻ denhardt’s solution (0.1%  xxxd3253xxx , type 400, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1%
bovine  xxxg124xxx , fraction v) and 3⫻ sspe (1⫻ ⫽ 0.15 m nacl/
0.01 m nah2po4. h2o, ph 7.4) at 60 °c. hybridization was performed
overnight in 1⫻ denhardt’s, 3⫻ sspe, and 106 cpm/ml of the rat
pg10.2 pcr probe at 60 °c. filters were washed for 15 min, five times,
in 0.2⫻ sspe and 0.2% sds at 60 °c and exposed to kodak xar film
for 1–2 days at ⫺80 °c.
reverse transcriptase pcr and pcr amplification—one microgram
of dnase i-treated total rna extracted from human retinal tissue was
used as the template for each first strand cdna synthesis. to generate
the central cdna region of human  xxxg1188xxx , the reverse primer,
5⬘-cctctagcagggtggagattgtgg, designed from the cdna sequence of the phage clone, hpg10.2.3, was used to synthesize the first
strand cdna. amplification of the cdna was performed with forward
(5⬘-ctctggtcagaaagtcctttg) and reverse (5⬘-cagtagaggcagagattgctacag) primers designed from human  xxxg1188xxx 

genomic sequence data2 and from the hpg10.2.3 cdna sequence, respectively. the 5⬘-cdna region of  xxxg1188xxx  was generated using the
reverse primer (5⬘-cagtagaggcagagattgctacag) for first
strand cdna synthesis. the cdna amplification was performed using
low stringency pcr conditions with the forward (5⬘-tggttttggcccaaatgattatgtttctcc) and reverse (5⬘-gtcctttcctcagaagccacag) primers that were derived from rat pg10.2 cdna sequence
and from human  xxxg1188xxx  cdna sequence, respectively. low stringency pcr was performed at the following temperatures after an initial
incubation of 94 °c for 3 min, 94 °c for 30 s, 45 °c for 30 s, and 68 °c for
2 min for two preliminary cycles. for the next 30 cycles, the conditions
were as follows: 94 °c for 30 s, 50 °c for 30 s, and 72 °c for 2 min with
a final 10-min extension step at 72 °c. all other pcr procedures were
performed as follows: 94 °c for 30 s, 55 °c for 30 s, and 72 °c for 3.5 min
for 30 cycles after an initial incubation at 94 °c for 3 min and with a
final 10-min extension step at 72 °c. the first strand cdna syntheses
and pcr steps were performed using superscript ii rnase h-reverse
transcriptase and platinum taq dna polymerase (life technologies,
inc.), respectively, as recommended by the manufacturer.
dna sequencing and analysis—sequencing was performed by the
dideoxynucleotide chain termination dna-sequencing method using
the t7 sequenase version 2.0 dna sequencing kit (amersham pharmacia biotech). sequence was analyzed using dna strider 1.2 (christian marck, center d’etudes de saclay, cedex, france) and geneworks
(intelligenetics, mountain view, ca) software.
chromosomal localization—the forward (5⬘-ctcacatgacagttagatgg) and reverse (5⬘-cagagtctctgtgacctacag) pcr
primers used for chromosomal localization of the  xxxg1188xxx  gene
were designed from the 3⬘-untranslated region of  xxxg1188xxx , identified in image clone aa815118 from a blast search using the rat
pg10.2 sequence. localization was performed by research genetics,
inc., using dna from each of 93 radiation hybrid panel cell lines as pcr
templates. the localization was confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis (genome systems, inc, st. louis, mo).
northern analysis—total rna from human tissues was either purchased from clontech (palo alto, ca) or isolated from the human
tissues using rnaeasy kit (qiagen inc., valencia, ca). macula and
peripheral retina rna were isolated from 5-mm punches from fresh
monkey retina as described previously (28). the rna was separated by
electrophoresis in a 1.2% agarose formaldehyde gel at 56 v for 3.5 h.
the gel was stained with syb green ii (molecular probes, eugene, or)
then scanned using a storm 860 apparatus (molecular dynamics,
inc., sunnyvale, ca). the gel was blotted and probed with a 462-base
pair  xxxg1188xxx  probe generated by pcr using the forward (5⬘-ccgtgtatgaaagtcacagg) and reverse (5⬘-cacagcattcagtctttatag) primers. the quantification was performed using molecular
dynamic’s imagequant 5.0 software and microsoft (seattle, wa) excel
software using a similar method (29).
in situ hybridization—the cdna insert of the phage clone,
hpg10.2.3, was subcloned into the ecori site of the pgem-4z vector
(promega, madison, wi). sense and antisense riboprobes, labeled with
35
s-labeled utp (1250 ci/mmol, nen life science products), were
generated using sp6 and t7 rna polymerases, respectively. in situ
hybridization histochemistry was performed on fresh frozen human
retinal and pineal gland sections cut at 12 ␮m. these sections were
processed as described previously (30) and were dipped in emulsion and
developed after exposure for 2 months. sections were examined with
bright and darkfield illumination using a leitz photomicroscope. images were digitized using a sensys-kf1401e ccd camera (photometrics, tuscon, az) and manipulated with iplab (scanalytics, fairfax,
va), adobe 5.0 (adobe systems, san jose, ca), and canvas 6 (deneba,
miami, fl) software on a powerpc macintosh computer.
ipm isolation—after bisecting the eye, retinas were removed from
the posterior pole and washed extensively with pbs containing protease inhibitors to remove soluble molecules followed by detachment of
the insoluble ipm with distilled water (21, 31). the insoluble ipm was
collected (20) after centrifugation, and the pellet was solubilized in 0.1
m tris-buffered saline, ph 8.0, containing 5 mm dithiothreitol.
enzyme digestions—chondroitinase abc: 50 ␮l of 1 mg/ml ipm
extract was resuspended in 0.1 m tris acetate buffer, ph 7.3, and 3
milliunits of the enzyme, containing protease inhibitors, was added to
the tube. the reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 °c for 3 h. streptomyces hyaluronidase: ipm extract (100 ␮g of total protein) was incubated in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, ph 6.0, for 2 h at 37 °c with
streptomyces hyaluronidase (2–5 tru). n-glycosidase: samples (50 ␮g)

page. after electrophoresis the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using the bio-rad semi-dry blotting
system. the membranes were blocked using 2% bsa in pbs before
incubating with 1:100 dilution of biotinylated ⌬di6s antibody overnight
at 4 °c. after incubation with avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase
(1:5000 in pbs), the protein bands were visualized with the peroxidase
color reaction as described previously. bsa was included in the cpc
precipitation studies as a negative control (21).
immunocytochemistry—eyes arrived at the laboratory in eye bank
jars on ice. they were gently opened with a razor blade, cutting posterior to the limbus prior to immersion fixation. freshly isolated eyes and
pineal glands used for anti- xxxg1188xxx  immunocytochemistry were
preserved in a fixative containing 4% formaldehyde (freshly prepared
from paraformaldehyde), in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (ph 7.2). after
removal from the fixative, tissues were rinsed in 3 ⫻ 10 min changes of
0.1 m phosphate buffer and processed for paraffin microscopy using
standard dehydration and infiltration procedures. tissue sections cut at
7 ␮m were placed on superfrost slides, deparaffinized with xylene, and
hydrated through graded ethanols prior to enzyme digestion or antibody application.
chondroitinase abc digestions were performed on deparaffinized
tissue sections mounted on microscope slides (seikagaku corp., 460
milliunits/ml in 0.1 m tris acetate, ph 7.3, 37 °c, 1 h). tissue sections
were incubated with 6% bsa in phosphate buffer (0.1 m, ph 7.2) for 30
min to block nonspecific antibody binding. sections were incubated with
the primary  xxxg1188xxx  antibody (diluted 1:2000) in 6% bsa, 0.1 m
phosphate buffer overnight at 4 °c. after rinsing extensively with 0.1 m
phosphate buffer, sections were treated with abc (vector labs., 1:200
dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. sections were washed with 0.1 m
phosphate buffer and incubated in 0.05% 3,3⬘-diaminobenzidine (sigma) and 0.03%  xxxd2298xxx  in the phosphate buffer at room
temperature. sections were examined unstained with transmitted light
or nomarski optics using a zeiss axiophot photomicroscope. images
were digitized using a hamamatsu ccd camera and manipulated with
photoshop 4.0 software on a power macintosh computer.
results

cloning of human  xxxg1188xxx  cdna—to clone the human
 xxxg1188xxx  cdna, phage clones of a human retina cdna
library were screened using a partial cdna of the rat homolog,
pg10.2 (24), as a probe. six positive clones were isolated and
the nucleotide sequence of the largest clone (hpg10.2.3, 1.95
kilobases) was determined. comparison with the rat pg10.2
cdna revealed that hpg10.2.3 contained the 3⬘-half of
 xxxg1188xxx ⬘s open reading frame. the remaining  xxxg1188xxx 
cdna was obtained by employing reverse transcriptase-pcr
using rna extracted from human retina and by subsequent
pcr amplification. the combined nucleotide sequence from the
three partially overlapping cdna clones contains 3989 base
pairs (fig. 1).
two in-frame methionine codons (atg) are present at nucleotides 15 and 21, and a stop codon (taa) is evident at nucleotide 3738. at present it is unclear which aug codon in
 xxxg1188xxx  mrna would be preferred for translation initiation of  xxxg1188xxx  mrna. usually initiation occurs from the
first aug according to the kozak scanning model (33). however, the second aug has an a, a purine, in position ⫺3, which
is normally critical for function (33). it is also possible that both
codons are used.
downstream to the stop codon at nucleotide 3962 is a consensus polyadenylation motif (aataaa). if this is the true end
of the 3⬘-untranslated region of  xxxg1188xxx , then a large 5⬘untranslated region is likely to exist as the  xxxg1188xxx  transcript is approximately 9.0 kilobases (fig. 2). finally,
 xxxg1188xxx  has a 79% nucleotide sequence identity with rat
pg10.2 (24), which strongly suggests that they are indeed
orthologs.
chromosomal localization of  xxxg1188xxx —the  xxxg1188xxx 
gene was localized to chromosome 3q11.2 using radiation
hybrid panel screening and confirmed by fluorescent in situ
hybridization analysis. when the data were submitted to the

were denatured in 0.05 m phosphate buffer containing 0.2% sds and 50
mm dithiothreitol at 100 °c for 5 min. nonidet p-40 was added to a final
concentration of 0.7% in 100 ␮l of sample volume to which was added
0.3 milliunits in 1 ␮l of recombinant peptide n-glycosidase f. the
digestion was continued overnight at 37 °c. neuraminidase: 50 ␮g of
total protein was dissolved in 100 ␮l of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer,
ph 6.5. 50 milliunits/␮l neuraminidase were added followed by incubation for 1 h at 37 °c. o-glycosidase: ipm sample (50 ␮g), predigested
with neuraminidase as described above, was denatured by boiling in
0.1% sds, 10 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, ph 6.0. nonidet p-40 was
added in 10-fold excess of sds by weight followed by 50 milliunits of
o-glycosidase and overnight incubation at 37 °c.
antibody production—the insoluble ipm removed with distilled water was isolated as described previously (31). the ipm pellet was
obtained by centrifugation at 400 ⫻ g for 15 min on a table top centrifuge. the pellet was resuspended in cold 0.1 m tris-buffered saline (ph
8.0 containing 5 mm dithiothreitol). the supernatant was collected after
centrifugation (12,000 rpm) in a refrigerated microfuge. the supernatant was diluted 2⫻ with 0.1 m naoac, ph 6.0, and digested with
chondroitinase abc (300 milliunits/ml) for 3 h at 37 °c. at the end of
the incubation, an equal volume of sds sample buffer was added to the
ipm extract, the sample was denatured by boiling for 5 min in the
presence of 5%  xxxd26xxx , and the proteins were separated on
7.5% sds-page (30 ␮g of total protein/lane). after electrophoresis the
gel was rinsed with water three times before staining with gel code
blue. the gels were destained with water, and the 230-kda bands were
removed, minced, and sent to biodesign inc., kennebunk, maine for
immunization in rabbits. approximately 200 ␮g of  xxxg1188xxx  was
injected/boost. antibodies to  xxxg1188xxx  reached a suitable titer for
use in western blotting and immunocytochemical studies following the
third boost.
western blotting—sample extracts were subjected to sds-page and
electroblotted onto immobilon-p membranes followed by incubation in
pbs containing 2% bsa at ph 7.5 for 30 min. bsa was replaced by the
biotinylated lectin (20 ␮g/ml) in 1% bsa-pbs for lectin blots and incubated for 3 h at room temperature. for western blots, the membranes
were incubated with anti- xxxg1188xxx  (1:1000) or anti-⌬di6s (1:100) in
pbs-bsa overnight at 4 °c after bsa blocking. the membranes were
washed with pbs-tween (3 times) and incubated with biotinylated
horseradish peroxidase-avidin complex or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000) for 1 h at room temperature. the
membranes were washed and the color reaction developed using the
substrates 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate-nitro blue tetrazolium
or 3,3⬘-diaminobenzidine.
pna-agarose affinity chromatography—ipm extract as prepared
above was digested with chondroitinase abc (3 milliunits/50 ␮g of
protein) in 50 mm tris acetate buffer, ph 7.3, at 37 °c for 2 h. this was
loaded on a pna-agarose affinity resin (vector labs) prequilibrated with
pbs. the column was washed with pbs and eluted with 0.2 m lactose.
fractions were dialyzed and then analyzed by sds-page followed by
gel code blue staining for the presence of  xxxg1188xxx .
protein/peptide sequencing—ipm extracts in tris-hcl were further
separated on a 7.5% sds-page gel. the gel was stained with gel code
blue, and the band excised, destained, and sent to the howard hughes
medical institute biopolymer laboratory and wm keck foundation
biotechnology resource foundation at yale university, new haven, ct
for digestion with trypsin and separation by liquid chromatographymass spectrometry. three of the resultant peptides were sequenced by
edman degradation. affinity purified  xxxg1188xxx  was separated by
sds-page and transferred to immobilon-p membranes, stained with
coomassie blue.  xxxg1188xxx  bands were excised and sequenced on an
applied biosystems gas phase sequencer at the case western biotechnology core laboratory, cleveland, ohio.
cpc precipitation—to demonstrate ha binding to  xxxg1188xxx  we
used a protocol similar to that described (21). briefly, pna-agarosepurified  xxxg1188xxx  core protein samples (1 ␮g) in 50 mm tris acetate
buffer (ph 7.3) containing 0.5 m nacl were incubated for 1 h at room
temperature with and without  xxxd2289xxx  (50 ␮g). control samples were
digested with streptomyces hyaluronidase (1 tru) for 1 h at 37 °c prior
to cpc precipitation. inhibition of endogenous ha binding was performed in the presence of ha oligosaccharides (100 ␮g/ml). bsa (2 ␮g)
incubated with  xxxd2289xxx  was used as a negative control. cpc (1.25% final
concentration) was added to the samples and further incubated for 1 h.
the cpc pellet and supernatant were obtained by centrifugation
(12,000 rpm) of the sample for 15 min at room temperature. the pellets
were rinsed twice with 1% cpc in tris acetate buffer. pellets were
resuspended in 20 ␮l of water and boiled in sds-page sample buffer
(32) before the proteins in the pellet and supernatant were separated by

whitehead/mit server and tested against the current framework markers,  xxxg1188xxx  was localized between markers
wi-11447 and wi-16656 (34).
tissue distribution of  xxxg1188xxx  expression—northern
blot analysis on a variety of human tissues was performed to
determine the tissue specificity and the relative levels of expression of  xxxg1188xxx  mrna (fig. 2). approximately 5 ␮g of
total rna was used for each tissue. the blot was probed with
a 3⬘-end  xxxg1188xxx -specific cdna probe. the relative levels
of expression were determined by normalizing the syb green
ii-stained 28 s ribosomal rna band to the signal generated by
the probe using a storm 860 phosphoimager (29). the
 xxxg1188xxx  hybridization signal was observed exclusively in
the retina and pineal gland mrna samples, indicating that the
 xxxg1188xxx  gene is expressed only in these tissues. the predominant  xxxg1188xxx  mrna appears to be approximately 9
kilobases in length although a smaller and more diffuse signal
is also evident at approximately 4.4 kilobases (fig. 2).
cellular localization of  xxxg1188xxx  expression—in situ
hybridization was performed on fresh frozen sections of the
human retina and pineal gland. the 35s-labeled antisense
riboprobe signal was localized to the outer retina with a high
density of silver grains over the photoreceptor inner segments and a weaker density over the photoreceptor nuclei
(fig. 3, a and b). both rod and cone photoreceptors were

riboprobe were virtually free of silver grains (fig. 3, c and d).

in the pineal gland,  xxxg1188xxx  35s-labeled antisense hybridization was evident throughout most regions with the
exception of the connective tissue septa. these septal areas
also contain blood vessels, and gliotic or fibrotic-like inclusions (fig. 3, e, g, and h). pineal sections incubated with the
35
s-labeled sense riboprobe were virtually free of silver
grains (fig. 3f).
features of the putative polypeptide—the nucleotide sequence of the  xxxg1188xxx  cdna presented in fig. 1 contains
an open reading frame that encodes 1241 amino acids. the
deduced amino acid of the  xxxg1188xxx  polypeptide is presented in fig. 4. several potentially important features are
evident. (a) a large mucin-like domain, containing numerous
potential o-linked glycosylation sites (76 serine and 35 threonine residues), is located in the central part of the sequence
(thr393-thr835). (b). six consensus sites for n-linked glycosylation are present in two clusters, four on the n-terminal side
and two on the c-terminal side of the mucin domain (at residues asn154, asn301, asn320, asn370, asn942, and asn956). (c)
four consensus sites for gag attachment are present. the first
is at residue ser603, near the center of the mucin domain, which
conforms to the consensus sequence sgxg (35). the other
three are on the c-terminal side of the mucin domain (at
residues ser1007, ser1031, and ser1187) and conform to the consensus sequence sg (acidic) (36). ser1031 is located between two
cysteine residues (cys1025 and cys1036) and may not be functional. (d) a linear ha-binding motif is present in the deduced

sequence spanning residues arg1125-arg1133 (37).3 (e) two
egf-like motifs, arranged in tandem, are present near the c
terminus (cys1014-cys1050 and cys1054-cys1092). egf-like motifs contain six conserved cysteine residues that participate in
the intrachain disulfide bonding required for the structural
stability of the motif (38). (f) also present is a 24-amino acid
hydrophobic sequence c-terminally to the egf-like domain
(iso1101-iso1124) suggesting a membrane-spanning region.
identification of the  xxxg1188xxx  gene product—the putative gag attachment sites in the deduced amino acid sequence
of  xxxg1188xxx  (fig. 4) and the identification of  xxxg1188xxx ⬘s
restricted retinal expression to photoreceptors (fig. 3, a and b)
suggest that  xxxg1188xxx  may be a candidate for a singularly
abundant  xxxd1687xxx   xxxg612xxx  in the
human ipm that was recently characterized using a ⌬di6s
monoclonal antibody following digestion of the human ipm
samples with chondroitinase abc (23). to identify this 230kda core protein, the protein band was cut from the gel following page of chondroitinase abc-digested ipm extracts and
submitted for n-terminal analysis. accordingly, the sequence
silfp was obtained, which is identical to residues ser82-pro86
in the deduced sequence of  xxxg1188xxx  (fig. 4). two internal
peptides liberated following trypsin digestion of the 230-kda
core protein were also analyzed producing the sequences tfwdr and vspflpdasmek. these correspond to sequences
thr123-arg127 and val582-lys593, respectively, in the deduced
sequence (fig. 4). thus, the 100% concordance of the amino
acid sequences of these three peptides to the sequences deduced from human  xxxg1188xxx  cdna indicates that the 2303

further carbohydrate analysis of  xxxg1188xxx —insoluble
ipm extracts containing  xxxg1188xxx  were analyzed with 5%
sds-page before and after chondroitinase abc digestion and
stained with gel code blue or the lectin wheat germ agglutinin
to estimate the change in  xxxg1188xxx  mass (fig. 5a). in the
undigested sample,  xxxg1188xxx  migrated as a broad smear
with a peak intensity close to 400 kda (fig. 5a, lanes 1 and 3).
this apparent molecular mass was estimated using chondroitinase-digested rat chondrosarcoma  xxxg33xxx  (400 kda) as the
standard (39) (fig. 5a, lane 5). after digestion  xxxg1188xxx  was
visible at a lower position at around 230 kda, and the broad
smear, present in the higher molecular weight range of the
undigested sample, was absent (fig. 5a, lanes 2 and 4).
when the ipm samples were separated using a 7.5% gel, the
high molecular weight components present in the undigested
ipm sample only minimally entered the gel and were present
at the top of the lane as seen in the gel code blue-stained gels
(fig. 5b, lane 1). following digestion with chondroitinase abc
(fig. 5b, lane 2), the high molecular mass band at the top of the
lane was no longer present, and a new band was observed just
above the 220-kda marker. this dramatic increase in electrophoretic mobility of the high molecular weight ipm protein
following chondroitinase digestions clearly indicates that this
molecule represents the core protein of a chondroitin-type
proteoglycan.
we also used the ⌬di6s antibody (40, 41) to label
 xxxg1188xxx  in the ipm. in the western blot using the ⌬di6s
antibody (fig. 5b, lanes 3– 4), no immunostaining was evident
in the undigested sample (lane 3), whereas intense immunostaining of the 230-kda  xxxg1188xxx  band was present in the
chondroitinase abc-digested sample (lane 4). lower levels of

immunoreactivity to the ⌬di6s antibody were also evident in
western blots (fig. 5b, lane 4) in bands at approximately
170 –180-kda and 130-kda. absent was any immunoreactivity
of the 150-kda spacr band, which appears devoid of any
background staining (fig. 5b, lane 4), as has recently been
reported (23). in contrast, when pna was used in lectin blotting studies, the 150-kda spacr band was the only region of
the blot stained in the undigested ipm sample (fig. 5b, lane 5)
(21). following chondroitinase abc digestion, in addition to
the 150-kda spacr band, other proteins have entered the gel,
which bind pna (fig. 5b, lane 6). most intensely decorated is
the 230-kda  xxxg1188xxx  band with minor labeling of bands at
approximately 170 –180 kda.
the deduced sequence of  xxxg1188xxx  also contains numerous potential sites for o-linked sugars in the large mucin
domain and six consensus sites for n-linked sugars (fig. 4). to
obtain direct information regarding other oligosaccharides associated with  xxxg1188xxx  we performed a series of glycosidase
digestions and followed changes in electrophoretic mobility of
the core protein with an anti- xxxg1188xxx  antibody. the antispacrcan antibody was prepared using the 230-kda band
generated following chondroitinase abc digestion. the 230kda band was cut from a gel code blue-stained gel and used
for immunizing a rabbit. fig. 5c, lanes 1 and 2 are western
blots of the crude ipm sample separated on a 7.5% sds-page
gel before and after chondroitinase abc digestion, respectively, and labeled with the anti- xxxg1188xxx  antibody. immunoreactivity is present only in the chondroitinase abc-treated
sample associated with the 230-kda band (lane 2). no immunoreactivity is present in the undigested sample (lane 1), although in some preparations (not shown) weak immunoreac-

lane 1. in some undigested samples, the antibody did weakly label the
material that accumulates at the stacking gel, but labeling of the
sample presented in lane 1 is not evident. lane 3 contains a sample first
digested with chondroitinase abc followed by n-glycosidase digestion.
lane 4 contains a chondroitinase abc, n-, and o-glycosidase-digested
sample. note the progressive increase in  xxxg1188xxx  mobility following removal of the n- and o-linked carbohydrates (lanes 2– 4).

tivity was detected at the top of the lane where  xxxg1188xxx ,
with the full complement of  xxxd1687xxx  gags is presumably located. compared with the position of chondroitinase
abc-digested  xxxg1188xxx  (fig. 5c, lane 2), a progressive increase in mobility of  xxxg1188xxx  was observed when digested
sequentially with n- and o-glycosidases (fig. 5c, lanes 3 and
4). n-glycosidase decreased the apparent molecular mass by
approximately 40 kda suggesting that n-linked glycoconjugates account for at least 10% of the mass of  xxxg1188xxx . after

protein. met1-iso20 may represent the signal peptide that targets the
molecule for secretion. glu20-arg81 may represent a propeptide that is
cleaved following secretion. a large mucin-like domain is present near
the middle of the sequence (dotted underline) from thr393 to thr835.
this mucin-like domain contains 76 serine residues and 35 threonine
residues, potential sites for o-linked glycosylation. six consensus sites
for n-linked oligosaccharide attachment (n) are present. two tandem
egf-like motifs are present near the c-terminus (underlined). the six
conserved cystine residues (c) in each of the egf-like domains are
involved in interchain disulfide bonding required for stability of the
egf-like motif. four serine residues (s) are consensus sites for glycosaminoglycan attachment. a potential hyaluronan-binding motif
(double underline) is c-terminal to the mucin domain. a highly hydrophobic region near the c-terminus (strike through, iso1101-iso1124) suggests a transmembrane domain.

 xxxg1188xxx : a novel hyaluronan-binding proteoglycan

lecular mass of the remaining core protein was approximately
160 kda. these glycosidase digestions demonstrate that
 xxxg1188xxx  contains both n- and o-linked glycoconjugates,
consistent with the presence of putative n-linked and o-linked
glycosylation sites in the deduced sequence. additionally, the
loss of approximately 240 kda following carbohydrate removal
(from about 400 kda in fig. 5a, lanes 1 and 3 to around 160
kda in fig. 5c, lane 4), suggests that glycoconjugates account
for approximately 60% of the mass of  xxxg1188xxx .
tissue distribution of  xxxg1188xxx  proteoglycan—the distribution of anti- xxxg1188xxx  immunoreactivity was established
in tissue sections of human retina and pineal gland (fig. 6).
the polyclonal antibody to human  xxxg1188xxx , which showed
specific binding to the  xxxg1188xxx  band in western blots (fig.
5c, lane 2), also intensely labels the ipm around both rods and
cones (fig. 6a). in contrast, the ipm in sections treated with
preimmune serum was unlabeled (fig. 6b). these results indicate that in the retina,  xxxg1188xxx  is localized to the ipm
where it is present around both rod and cone photoreceptors. in
pineal sections, the anti- xxxg1188xxx  antibody showed diffuse
immunoreactivity with intense staining of the cell bodies of the
pinealocytes, but no staining in the septal areas (fig. 6c).
control sections treated with preimmune serum showed some
diffuse background staining but specific pinealocyte labeling
was absent (fig. 6d). these data indicate that in the retina and
in pineal gland,  xxxg1188xxx  is localized to the ipm, where it is
present around both rod and cone photoreceptors and is present in pinealocytes, respectively. these localization patterns
therefore reflect the cellular localization of  xxxg1188xxx  mrna
expression (fig. 3).
function of  xxxg1188xxx —the presence of putative ha-binding motifs in the deduced amino acid sequence of  xxxg1188xxx 
(fig. 4) and the earlier reports that ha is present in the ipm
(26, 42, 43) suggest that one function of  xxxg1188xxx  may be to
form associative interactions with ha. to evaluate this possibility we performed experiments using cpc, a detergent that
selectively precipitates gags and any covalently or noncovalently associated protein (44). we have demonstrated previously (21) that  xxxg1188xxx  present in ipm extracts can be

selectively precipitated using cpc. this is because cpc efficiently precipitates proteoglycans through interactions with
their covalently attached gags. when we used a hyaluronanfree preparation of  xxxg1188xxx  purified by deae-sepharose
ion-exchange chromatography (45) in a cpc precipitation assay,  xxxg1188xxx  was found in the pellet fraction both in the
presence and absence of hyaluronan.4 this confirms our result
that the proteoglycan  xxxg1188xxx  interacts with cpc in an
ha-independent manner.
to directly evaluate the binding of the core protein of
 xxxg1188xxx  to ha we first digested the ipm extracts with
chondroitinase abc to remove the gag chains, followed by
pna-agarose chromatography. such a preparation contains
mainly  xxxg1188xxx  and spacr along with some minor pnabinding proteins (compare fig. 5b, lanes 5 and 6). when this
sample was subjected to cpc precipitation and the pellet and
supernatant components were separated with page, blotted,
and  xxxg1188xxx  detected with the ⌬di6s antibody, a distinct
 xxxg1188xxx  band was decorated with the antibody in both the
supernatant and pellet (fig. 7, lanes 1). following the addition
of 50 ␮g/ml  xxxd2289xxx , a source of ha, to the sample before cpc
precipitation,  xxxg1188xxx  was present only in the pellet fraction (fig. 7, lanes 2). however, when the sample was treated
with streptomyces hyaluronidase before precipitation with
cpc,  xxxg1188xxx  was present only in the supernatant and not
in the pellet (fig. 7, lanes 3). preincubation of the sample with
ha oligosaccharides (100 ␮g/ml) before cpc precipitation led
to the presence of  xxxg1188xxx  only in the supernatant (fig. 7,
lanes 4). in comparison, preincubation of the sample with ha
oligosaccharides before the addition of  xxxd2289xxx  resulted in the
presence of  xxxg1188xxx  in the pellet and not in the supernatant (fig. 7, lanes 5). as a negative control, bsa was incubated
with  xxxd2289xxx  before cpc precipitation. bsa was only present in
the supernatant and not in the pellet (fig. 7, lanes 6). collectively these precipitation studies indicate that  xxxg1188xxx  can
bind ha in the absence of its gag chains.
discussion

expression and localization of  xxxg1188xxx —the combined
results of the northern and in situ hybridization analyses
indicate that  xxxg1188xxx  mrna is present only in the retina
and pineal gland and that within these multicellular tissues,
 xxxg1188xxx  gene expression is restricted to rod and cone photoreceptors of the retina and pinealocytes in the pineal gland.
photoreceptors and pinealocytes are the most abundant cell
type in the retina and pineal gland and these highly specialized
cells are phylogenetically related (46, 47). a number of molecules expressed by retinal photoreceptors are also expressed in
the pineal gland, including interphotoreceptor matrix retinoidbinding protein (48), cone arrestin (49), opsins (50), transducin
(51), and several other molecules involved in the phototransduction cascade (52).  xxxg1188xxx , initially cloned from rat
pineal (24), can be added to this group of molecules that are
expressed by photoreceptors and pinealocytes.
the localization pattern of  xxxg1188xxx  gene expression is
also comparable to the localization of  xxxg1188xxx  protein product as demonstrated by the immunohistochemical data using
the anti- xxxg1188xxx  antibody. furthermore, the antispacrcan antibody used in the western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses of chondroitinase-digested human
retinal tissues depicts virtually identical patterns of labeling as
seen with the monoclonal ⌬di6s antibody described previously
(23). these data, together with the n-terminal sequencing
analysis presented in this study, demonstrate that the 230-kda

 xxxg1188xxx : a novel hyaluronan-binding proteoglycan

 xxxd1687xxx   xxxg612xxx  is indeed
 xxxg1188xxx . it should also be noted that the retinal distribution of  xxxg1188xxx  immunoreactivity was in the ipm, an extracellular compartment, whereas in the pineal gland, these
antibodies show a distribution of immunoreactivity over the
pinealocytes. these fundamental differences in localization of
 xxxg1188xxx  in retina and pineal gland may reflect differences
in processing and/or function of this molecule in these two
tissues.
features of the deduced polypeptide of  xxxg1188xxx —because the n-terminal sequence of the  xxxg1188xxx  core protein
isolated from the ipm corresponds to residues ser82-pro86 in
the deduced sequence, it is unlikely that residues met1-arg81
are a part of the functional protein and suggests that the
functional n terminus of the mature protein begins at ser82.
met1-gly22 is probably the signal peptide involved in the secretion of this molecule, because it has the required tripartate
structure, including a central hydrophobic region (phe4-leu19)
flanked by two hydrophilic sequences (met1-met3 and ile20gly22). the putative clevage site of this signal sequence conforms to the ⫺1, ⫺3 rule where ⫺1 (gly22) does not have a long
side chain and ⫺3 (ile20) is not a charged amino acid (53). the

fig. 7. binding of hyaluronan to  xxxg1188xxx  core protein. the
core protein of  xxxg1188xxx  was purified by pna-agarose affinity chromatography after digestion of the ipm extract with chondroitinase
abc. precipitation assays were performed on samples using 1.25%
cpc, and both supernatant (upper panel) and pellets (lower panel) were
analyzed by western blotting using the ⌬di6s antibody after separation on 7.5% sds-page. lane 1 contains a pna-purified sample precipitated with cpc. note the immunoreactivity of  xxxg1188xxx  in both
supernatant (upper lane 1) and pellet (lower lane 1), suggesting the
presence of endogenous ha in the sample. lane 2 contains a sample
preincubated with  xxxd2289xxx  (50 ␮g/ml) for 1 h at 37 °c before cpc
precipitation.  xxxg1188xxx  is present in the pellet (lower lane 2) but not
in the supernatant (upper lane 2). lane 3 contains purified  xxxg1188xxx 
predigested with streptomyces hyaluronidase for 1 h at 37 °c prior to
cpc precipitation. this hyaluronidase degrades only ha, which results
in the retention of  xxxg1188xxx  in the supernatant (upper lane 3) with
none in the pellet (lower lane 3). lane 4 contains a sample preincubated
with a 22-saccharide fragment of ha (100 ␮g/ml) for 1 h at 37 °c. this
ha oligosaccharide is able to prevent cpc precipitation of  xxxg1188xxx ,
as evidenced by the presence of  xxxg1188xxx  in the supernatant (upper
lane 4) and the absence of  xxxg1188xxx  in the pellet (lower lane 4). the
addition of  xxxd2289xxx  after preincubation of the sample with the ha
oligosaccharide led to the accumulation of all  xxxg1188xxx  in the pellet
only (lower lane 5) with none remaining in the supernatant (upper lane
5). lanes 1–5 are western blots stained with the ⌬di6s antibody. lane
6 contains a gel code blue-stained gel of a negative control incubation
of bsa and  xxxd2289xxx  prior to cpc precipitation. note that all bsa is
retained in the supernatant (upper lane 6), and none is present in the
pellet (lower lane 6).

remaining sequence (asp23-arg81) is likely a propeptide cleaved
from the functional protein following secretion.
 xxxg1188xxx  contains two egf-like modules near the c terminus of the deduced sequence (fig. 4). egf-like modules are
characteristic of a number of extracellular matrix proteins and
are implicated in cell-matrix interactions (54 –56). some egflike domains require calcium for their biological function (57).
interestingly, one of the egf-like domains in  xxxg1188xxx 
contains the critical asparagine (asp1028), which has been implicated in calcium binding (57), whereas the other domain
does not. the potential for calcium binding by  xxxg1188xxx 
suggests an important physiological role for this molecule in
sequestering extracellular calcium released by photoreceptors
in response to light (58 – 60).
 xxxg1188xxx  may also participate in calcium binding in the
pineal through its egf-like module. many mammals, including humans, develop calcified inclusions with increasing age
(corpora arenacea or pineal sand) (47). these inclusions consist
primarily of hydroxyapatite, calcium phosphate, and an organic component (61, 62). the cause of these concretions is not
known, although there are several hypotheses. they include
intracellular calcium accumulation and mineralization leading
to pinealocyte degeneration and subsequent release of these
deposits (63), and the exchange of released polypeptides, combined with a carrier protein, for calcium by the vascular system. the calcium is then supposedly deposited as concretions
(64). whether  xxxg1188xxx  binds calcium in the pineal gland
and is involved in pineal sand formation remains to be
determined.
a short hydrophobic region in the deduced  xxxg1188xxx 
polypeptide suggests that it could function as a membranespanning domain (fig. 4, iso1101-iso1124). this region shows an
average of 2.5 on the hydropathy scale, suggesting it may
represent a putative membrane-spanning segment (64, 65). a
similar putative transmembrane domain is also present in the
predicted sequence of the rat homolog pg10.2 and other chondroitin and heparin sulfate proteoglycans, including neuroglycan c and the  xxxg2036xxx  family (24, 66 – 68). it should be noted
that the procedures used to isolate  xxxg1188xxx  from the ipm
( xxxd3449xxx  extraction) would not be expected to remove proteins that are anchored to the plasma membrane in this manner. either this putative membrane-spanning region is nonfunctional or  xxxg1188xxx  may be cleaved n-terminal to this
transmembrane region and released to the extracellular compartment. additional studies will be required to resolve this
issue.
hyaluronan binding of  xxxg1188xxx —the cpc precipitation
studies indicate that  xxxg1188xxx  can bind ha in the absence
of its gag chains. the finding that cpc can partially precipitate  xxxg1188xxx  in the absence of exogenous ha suggests
that endogenous ha is in the sample but not at a sufficient
concentration to interact with all the  xxxg1188xxx  molecules
present, because some  xxxg1188xxx  remains in the supernatant
(fig. 7, lanes 1). one might argue that the precipitation by cpc
was due to the presence of incompletely digested chondroitin
sulfate on  xxxg1188xxx . our finding that cpc precipitation of
 xxxg1188xxx  was eliminated when the sample was digested
with ha-specific hyaluronidase (fig. 7, lanes 3), clearly indicates that endogenous ha is the gag responsible for interaction with  xxxg1188xxx  in this preparation. we were also able to
block cpc precipitation of  xxxg1188xxx  by pretreatment with a
22-saccharide fragment of ha (fig. 7, lanes 4), suggesting that
these short ha fragments compete for ha binding of
 xxxg1188xxx  more efficiently than the endogenous ha. the ha
oligosaccharides were not able to prevent binding when exogenous ha was added (fig. 7, lanes 5), suggesting that higher

 xxxg1188xxx : a novel hyaluronan-binding proteoglycan
outer retina, such as  xxxg1188xxx  and spacr, which also
contain egf-like motifs, should be considered as new candidates for mutations in individuals with retinal degeneration,
particularly those with late onset macular degeneration.
in conclusion, the expression analyses and binding studies of
 xxxg1188xxx  demonstrate the synthesis of this novel proteoglycan by photoreceptors and pinealocytes. considering that
 xxxg1188xxx  binds ha and is the principal proteoglycan present in the human ipm, it may be of fundamental importance in
organizing the ipm to support photoreceptor function in higher
vertebrates.

concentrations of ha can more efficiently compete for the habinding sites. collectively, these precipitation studies clearly
indicate that  xxxg1188xxx  can bind ha. this function may have
an important role in organization of the ipm and may be
causally responsible for the difficulty in extracting this novel
molecule from the ipm using physiological salt solutions. it is
likely that  xxxg1188xxx -ha interactions are mediated through
the  xxxg1061xxx -type ha-binding motifs identified in the deduced sequence of  xxxg1188xxx 
(fig. 4) (37, 69),3 but confirmation of these regions as binding
sites must await experimental analysis.
a new family of ipm molecules—spacr is another novel
human ipm molecule recently characterized (20). when the
deduced amino acid sequences of  xxxg1188xxx  and spacr are
aligned, several homologous regions are evident (fig. 8). (a)
the first 81 residues from the deduced sequence of  xxxg1188xxx 
and the first 70 in spacr are not present in the isolated
molecules. from n-terminal sequence analysis we know that
the functional n terminus of  xxxg1188xxx  and spacr (20)
begins at residue ser81 and ser71, respectively, showing 54%
homology. (b) the four residues immediately preceding the
n-terminal sequence in both  xxxg1188xxx  (arg78-arg81) and
spacr (arg67-arg70) are rich in basic amino acids, suggesting
the cleavage sites of the propeptide. (c) both molecules contain
a large mucin-like domain near the central portion of the sequence. (d) both molecules contain clusters of n-linked consensus sites on either side of the mucin domains. three of these
n-linked sites are in perfect alignment and show 100% sequence identity. (e) both molecules contain putative ha-binding motifs. (f) both molecules contain egf-like modules near
the c terminus with five of the six conserved cysteine residues
in precise alignment and 66% homology between these modules.  xxxg1188xxx  contains a second egf-like domain not present in spacr immediately downstream to the egf-like domain described above. (g) both molecules contain conserved
 xxxd233xxx /asparagine residues in their egf domains, which
are required for calcium binding. this extensive list of homologies and features shared by these two ipm molecules suggests
that they represent two members of a novel family of extracellular matrix proteins.
targets for retinal degeneration—the retinal- and pinealspecific expression of  xxxg1188xxx  makes this molecule a potential candidate for mutations involved in degenerative retinal and/or pineal disease. in evaluating 3q11.2 where
 xxxg1188xxx  resides, no studies linking retinal or pineal diseases to this region have been reported. however, the potential
involvement of  xxxg1188xxx  in degenerative retinal disease
should not be dismissed a priori because of potentially important motifs contained in  xxxg1188xxx . for example, the egflike modules are of particular interest. recently the mutation
causing malattia leventinese (doyne’s honeycomb retinal dystrophy), an early onset form of macular degeneration, was
localized to the efemp1 gene. this gene codes for an extracellular matrix protein containing five egf-like modules (70).
a point mutation contained in every individual with this disorder causes an arg345 3 trp conversion in the last egf-like
module of efemp1. although efemp1 is expressed in many
nonocular tissues as well as in the retina (70), this is the first
documented mutation known to result in the accumulation of
extracellular debris (drusen) below the retinal pigment epithelium. drusen have been long known to be an important risk
factor for age-related macular degeneration (22, 71). drusen
formation associated with a mutation in an egf-like module in
efemp1 suggests that mutations in other genes coding for
molecules containing egf-like modules may also be causally
related to drusen formation. novel molecules present in the
