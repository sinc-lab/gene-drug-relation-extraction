been shown.7 however, similar to other general anesthetics, the exact mechanism of its action remains to be
shown.
the carboxylated imidazole etomidate exhibits structural similarities to specific ␣2-adrenoceptor agonists
that belong to the class of imidazole compounds, such as
clonidine and dexmedetomidine.8,9 besides the chemical structure, etomidate and ␣2-adrenoceptor agonists
share some clinical similarities, such as inducing sedation/hypnosis with high cardiovascular stability and only
minor respiratory depression.2,10,11 in accordance with
these findings, previous in vitro and in vivo studies
indicate that the anesthetic action of etomidate might at
least be partially mediated by ␣2-adrenoceptors.12
three subtypes of ␣2-adrenoceptors, termed ␣2a, ␣2b,
and ␣2c, have been cloned from several species including mice and humans.13–15 in both species, ␣2-receptor
subtypes are encoded by distinct genes which are localized on separate chromosomes. to further elucidate the
role of ␣2-adrenoceptors in the effects of etomidate, we
studied the interaction of etomidate with ␣2-adrenoceptor subtypes in vivo in mice carrying targeted deletions
of ␣2-receptor genes16 and in vitro in human embryonic
kidney (hek293) cells expressing individual murine ␣2receptor subtypes.17

background: the intravenous anesthetic etomidate exhibits
structural similarities to specific ␣2-adrenoceptor agonists of
the type such as dexmedetomidine. the current study was performed to elucidate the possible interaction of etomidate with
␣2-adrenoceptors in mice lacking individual ␣2-adrenoceptor
subtypes (␣2-ko).
methods: sedative and cardiovascular responses to etomidate
and the ␣2-agonist, dexmedetomidine, were determined in
mice deficient in ␣2-receptor subtypes. inhibition of binding of
the ␣2-receptor antagonist [3h]rx821002 to recombinant ␣2receptors by etomidate was tested in human embryonic kidney
(hek293) cells in vitro.
results: in vivo, loss and recovery of the righting reflex
required similar times after intraperitoneal injection of etomidate in wild-type and in ␣2a-receptor– deficient mice, indicating
that the hypnotic effect of etomidate in mice does not require
the ␣2a-receptor subtype. intravenous injection of etomidate
resulted in a transient increase (duration 2.4 ⴞ 0.2 min) in
arterial blood pressure in wild-type mice (17 ⴞ 3 mmhg). etomidate did not affect blood pressure in ␣2b-ko or ␣2ab-ko mice.
in membranes from hek293 cells transfected with ␣2-receptors, etomidate inhibited binding of the ␣2-antagonist,
[3h]rx821002, with higher potency from ␣2b- and ␣2c-receptors
than from ␣2a-receptors (ki ␣2a 208 ␮m, ␣2b 26 ␮m, ␣2c 56 ␮m).
in ␣2b-receptor– expressing hek293 cells, etomidate rapidly increased phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-related kinases  xxxg1369xxx /2.
conclusions: these results indicate that etomidate acts as an
agonist at ␣2-adrenoceptors, which appears in vivo primarily as
an ␣2b-receptor–mediated increase in blood pressure. this effect of etomidate may contribute to the cardiovascular stability
of patients after induction of anesthesia with etomidate.

materials and methods

etomidate (r-(⫹)ethyl-1-(1-phenylethyl)-1h-imidazole5-carboxylate) is a potent, short-acting hypnotic that was
introduced as an anesthetic in 1972.1 major advantages
described with the use of etomidate are its hemodynamic stability and the minimal respiratory depression.2,3 this pharmacologic profile renders etomidate
particularly suitable for induction of anesthesia in critically ill patients and patients with cardiovascular disease.
the anesthetic effect is thought to be mediated primarily
through an action on ␥- xxxd2177xxx  receptors.4 – 6
in addition, interactions of etomidate with second messenger systems such as the  xxxd2738xxx  metabolism have

generation and genotyping of ␣2-adrenoceptor–
deficient mice
the generation of the mouse lines lacking single ␣2adrenoceptor subtypes has been described previously.18,19 mice lacking ␣2a- and ␣2b-receptors (␣2ab-ko)
were generated by crossing of single gene knockout
lines to first obtain double heterozygous mice, which
were further intercrossed until homozygous ␣2ab-deficient mice were born. genotypes were confirmed by
subtype-specific polymerase chain reactions performed
with genomic dna isolated from small tail biopsies as
described in detail.20 mice were maintained in a specified pathogen-free facility. the university of würzburg
and the government of unterfranken (würzburg, germany) approved all animal procedures (protocol no.
621–2531.01–28/01).

1 mg/kg), and the time after injection at which the
righting reflex of mice was lost and the recovery time of
this reflex were monitored. because dexmedetomidine
at these doses did not induce a loss of the righting reflex,
its sedative effect was also assessed by placing mice on a
rotating wheel (30 rpm) and determining the time for
which mice stayed on the rod (rotarod; ugo basile,
varese, italy). for these series of experiments, male and
female mice (3– 4 months old, 5–10 mice per genotype)
were used. the observer was blinded with respect to the
genotype of the mice.
blood pressure recording and cardiac
catheterization
for hemodynamic measurements, two groups of male
mice were used at the age of 3–5 months. in the first
group, the cardiovascular effects of intravenous dexmedetomidine (5 ␮g/kg) were determined (eight mice per
genotype). the second group was used to measure hemodynamic parameters after etomidate injection (6 –10
mice per genotype). for aortic and left ventricular catheterization with a 1.4f pressure-volume catheter,21 mice
were anesthetized with tribromoethanol (13 ␮l of 2.5%
solution per g of body weight) and placed on a 37°c
table. the microtip catheter was inserted into the right
carotid artery and the pressure tip was advanced into the
aorta or into the left ventricle. for injection of drugs, a
pe-10 polyethylene tubing was inserted into the left
jugular vein. etomidate or dexmedetomidine were injected in 0.9% saline into the jugular vein catheter. hemodynamic data were digitized via a maclab system (ad
instruments, castle hill, australia) connected to an apple g4 powerpc computer (apple computer, inc., cupertino, ca).21
cell culture
stable cell lines of human embryonic kidney (hek293)
cells with high expression levels of either the cloned
murine ␣2a-adrenoceptor (14.6 pmol receptor/mg protein) or ␣2c-adrenoceptor (16.8 pmol receptor/mg protein) subtype were grown to near confluency in cell
culture at 37°c.17 in addition, because a stable cell line
expressing the ␣2b-adrenoceptor subtype was not available, native hek293 cells were transiently transfected
with the cloned mouse ␣2b-adrenoceptor subtype by the
calcium phosphate precipitation technique22 and used
48 h after transfection. transient transfection of ␣2badrenoceptors resulted in expression levels that were
similar to the stable cell lines.
initially, hek293 cells were washed with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. the cells were then scraped from
the culture dishes into 5 ml of ice-cold hypotonic buffer
(5 mm tris, 2 mm edta, ph 7.4) and washed again with
5 ml of ice-cold hypotonic buffer. cells were homogenized with an ultra-turrax (janke & kunkel, staufen,
germany) and cell nuclei and whole cells were removed

by centrifugation at 1,700g for 10 min at 4°c. membrane
vesicles were prepared by centrifugation of the supernatant at 145,000g for 30 min at 4°c. the resulting final
membrane pellet was resuspended in binding buffer
(75 mm n-methyl-d-glucamine, 25 mm glycine, 40 mm
hepes, 5 mm egta, 10 mm mgcl, ph 7.4). protein
concentrations were determined using a colorimetric
assay based on the method of bradford23 with bovine
 xxxg124xxx  as a reference standard.
competition binding studies
competition binding of etomidate to ␣2-adrenoceptors
was determined in a 200-␮l reaction containing 10 nm to
1 mm etomidate, the ␣2-adrenoceptor antagonist
[3h]rx821002 (3 nm), and binding buffer. nonspecific
binding was determined by addition of the ␣2-receptor
antagonist atipamezole (1 ␮m). the 200-␮l reactions containing only the solvent  xxxd3034xxx  without etomidate were used as controls. membranes (10 –20 ␮g protein) were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in the
binding mixture assay. the binding reaction was
stopped by filtration using a cell harvester and three
washes of buffer. membrane-bound [3h]rx821002 was
determined by scintillation counting.
mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation
to determine the agonist activity of etomidate, untransfected or ␣2b-receptor–transfected cells were stimulated for 20 min with 10 ␮m etomidate. before stimulation, hek cells were incubated overnight in serum-free
dulbecco’s modified eagle medium. stimulated hek
cells were rapidly scraped off the plates and frozen in
liquid nitrogen. cell lysates were prepared and used for
western blotting as described previously.20 antibodies
against the extracellular signal-related kinases  xxxg1369xxx /2
and phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2 were purchased from cell signaling (beverly, ma).
pharmaceutical compounds
the ␣2-antagonist [3h]rx821002 was used as a radioligand with a specific activity of 67 ci/mmol (amersham
pharmacia biotech, freiburg, germany). nonspecific
binding was determined using the antagonist atipamezole (orion corp., turku, finland). etomidate was either used as  xxxd2066xxx ® (2 mg etomidate/ml dissolved in 35%  xxxd3034xxx  in water; janssen-cilag,
neuss, germany) or as etomidate®- xxxd3030xxx  (2 mg etomidate/ml liposome suspension; braun, melsungen, germany).  xxxd3034xxx  was used as the inactive control
solution.
statistics
the results of the competition binding were analyzed
using a nonlinear regression program. a binding curve
was fitted according to a one-site competition model
(prism; graphpad, san diego, ca). data are presented as

results
etomidate-mediated hypnosis/sedation
in vivo, the sedative effect of ␣2-receptor activation is
almost exclusively mediated by the ␣2a-receptor subtype.25
thus, to test whether the sedative/hypnotic effect of etomidate is mediated via the ␣2a-receptor, the times for the
loss and for recovery of the righting reflex were determined in wild-type mice and in mice lacking ␣2a- or ␣2breceptors (␣2-ko). for these experiments, intraperitoneal
etomidate doses between 5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg were
tested in wild-type mice. whereas 5 mg/kg etomidate did
not result in loss of the righting reflex, 27% of the mice lost
the reflex  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg etomidate and all mice transiently
lost the righting reflex at 20-mg/kg and higher etomidate
doses. thus, we chose a dose of 30 mg/kg intraperitoneal
etomidate to investigate sedative effects of etomidate in
␣2-receptor-ko mice. after injection of etomidate, the
righting reflex disappeared in wild-type and ␣2a-deficient
mice at similar times after intraperitoneal injection (fig. 1a).
the duration of etomidate-induced sleep was not affected
by the ␣2a-deletion and the righting reflex recovered at
similar times in wild-type and ␣2a-ko mice. similarly, hypnotic properties of intraperitoneal thiopental (50 mg/kg)

deletion of the ␣2b-receptor gene did not affect the sedative effects of etomidate or thiopental in mice (fig. 1).
intraperitoneal injection of the non–subtype-selective ␣2agonist dexmedetomidine up to 1 mg/kg did not result in a
loss of the righting reflex. thus, the sedative effect of
dexmedetomidine was assessed on a rotating rod. dexmedetomidine exerted a sedative effect in wild-type mice and
in ␣2b-ko mice, as evidenced by the observation that the
mice were unable to stay on a rotating rod for longer than
10 –20 s (wild-type, 9 ⫾ 2 s; ␣2b-ko, 14 ⫾ 6 s; n ⫽ 8 mice
per genotype, 30 min after 500 ␮g/kg intraperitoneal

any sedative effects in response to dexmedetomidine
(␣2a-ko stayed on the rod for more than 60 s, n ⫽ 10
mice).
hemodynamic effects of etomidate in ␣2-receptordeficient mice
to test potential effects of etomidate on cardiovascular
␣2-receptor subtypes, we first generated double-knockout mice deficient in ␣2a- and ␣2b-receptors (fig. 2 a and
b). the ␣2ab-deficient mice were generated by crossing
single receptor knockouts to obtain double heterozygotes that were further crossed to yield mice with the
␣2a⫺/⫺b⫺/⫺ genotype (fig. 2c). at weaning age, ␣2abko mice were detected at a frequency that was close to the
expected mendelian ratio, indicating that genetic deletion
of these receptors did not interfere with embryonic devel-

first, we determined basal cardiovascular parameters in
anesthetized ␣2ab-ko mice. mean arterial pressure did not
differ between ␣2ab-deficient animals (85 ⫾ 4 mmhg,

however, ␣2ab-ko mice had a higher resting heart rate
(493 ⫾ 13 min⫺1, n ⫽ 9) than wild-type control mice
(446 ⫾ 13 min⫺1, n ⫽ 11). the cardiovascular response to
the ␣2-receptor agonist was tested in anesthetized mice of
different genotypes. as reported previously, rapid intravenous injection of dexmedetomidine resulted in a transient
hypertension in wild-type mice that was followed by a
long-lasting hypotension (fig. 3a). deletion of the ␣2a-receptor disrupted the hypotensive response, whereas the
initial hypertension was absent in ␣2b-deficient animals.
interestingly, ␣2ab-ko mice showed a small but significant
decrease in systolic blood pressure (⫺13 ⫾ 4 mmhg). this
pressure effect was accompanied by a decrease in heart
rate (⫺25 ⫾ 8 min⫺1, fig. 3b).
on intravenous injection of etomidate, wild-type mice
showed a rapid and transient hypertensive response that
was completely absent in mice lacking ␣2b-receptors (fig.

in heart rate were observed in ␣2b-ko or ␣2ab-ko mice.

showed identical effects on blood pressure in wild-type

␣2-adrenoceptors
to confirm the in vivo data, we next tested whether
etomidate interacts with recombinant ␣2-receptor subtypes expressed in hek293 cells. for these experiments,

to test whether etomidate acted as an agonist or antagonist at ␣2b-receptors, the effect of etomidate on
␣2-receptor–mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase
activation was assessed in hek293 cells. among other
intracellular signaling pathways, ␣2-receptors can effectively activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade.20 in untransfected or ␣2b-receptor– expressing
hek293 cells, basal phosphorylation of the  xxxg1369xxx /2 kinases was hardly detectable (fig. 6). however, short-term
exposure to etomidate increased  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation in hek293 cells transfected with ␣2b-receptors but
not in untransfected cells (fig. 6).

discussion
the present results indicate that etomidate interacts
with ␣2-adrenoceptors and displaces the ␣2-adrenoceptor antagonist [3h]rx821002 in hek293 cells from all
subtypes in a concentration-dependent manner. in addianesthesiology, v 99, no 4, oct 2003

tion, etomidate leads to a transient increase in blood
pressure in wild-type mice, but not in ␣2b-ko or ␣2ab-ko
mice, suggesting an interaction of etomidate with ␣2badrenoceptors in the peripheral vasculature.
␣2-adrenoceptors have been implicated in a variety of
physiologic functions. pharmacologic studies and the
development of genetic mouse models elucidated the
physiologic effects mediated by the different ␣2-adrenoceptor subtypes.16,18,26,27 the ␣2a-adrenoceptor subtype
has been reported to be the predominant subtype involved in the antinociceptive, sedative, hypotensive, hypothermic, and behavioral actions of ␣2-adrenoceptor
agonists.25,26,28,29 stimulation of ␣2b-adrenoceptors in
vascular smooth muscle leads to vasoconstriction, which
causes the initial hypertension after administration of
␣2-adrenoceptor agonists.18 in addition, the ␣2b-adrenoceptor subtype is involved in mediation of the antinociceptive action of nitrous oxide.30,31 the ␣2c-receptor
has been shown to modulate dopaminergic neurotransmission, various behavioral responses, and to induce
hypothermia.32,33 in addition, this subtype contributes
to spinal antinociception of the imidazoline  xxxd2674xxx 
in mice.34
the exact molecular targets by which etomidate mediates its anesthetic effects remain under discussion. clinically relevant plasma concentrations of etomidate to induce
hypnosis vary considerably. during induction of anesthesia
in humans, initial plasma concentrations of etomidate may
be as high as 12–24 ␮m.35 these concentrations are similar
to the ki value of etomidate for ␣2b-receptors expressed in

paris et al.

894

hek293 cells in our study. etomidate concentrations from
1.2– 8.2 ␮m have been reported as the minimal hypnotic
plasma levels for anesthesia in humans.35 it has been
shown that etomidate at these concentrations exhibits
␥- xxxd2177xxx –modulatory effects, and at higher concentrations exhibits ␥- xxxd2177xxx –mimetic effects at
␥- xxxd2177xxx  receptor type a receptors.4,5,36,37 interestingly, mice with a point mutation in the ␤3 subunit of
the ␥- xxxd2177xxx  receptor type a receptor did not
show any suppression of noxious-evoked movements in
response to etomidate.6 in this study, 5 mg/kg etomidate
was injected intravenously in wild-type mice to elicit a loss
of the reflex, which lasted for approximately 10 min.6 in
our study, we observed a significant transient hypertensive
response to intravenous injection of 2 mg/kg etomidate.
thus, higher doses of etomidate may even cause a more
pronounced hypertensive phase in mice. however, in the
other study, the mice were already anesthetized with tribromoethanol for arterial catheterization and we did not
use higher doses of etomidate to prevent toxicity. the low
affinity of etomidate for the ␣2a-adrenoceptor subtype determined in the current study challenges the assumption
that the anesthetic effects of etomidate could be partially
mediated by an action on cerebral ␣2-adrenoceptors. indeed, we found no difference in the sedative/hypnotic
effect of etomidate between normal mice and animals lacking functional ␣2a-adrenoceptors.
our results show a higher affinity of etomidate for ␣2band ␣2c-adrenoceptor subtypes expressed in hek293
cells. the role of the ␣2c adrenoceptor subtype in anesthesia and cardiovascular control is currently still unknown. previous investigations in mice have shown that
disruption of the ␣2c-adrenoceptor subtype does not
lead to hemodynamic effects.18 however, ␣2c-receptors
operate together with ␣2a-receptors as presynaptic inhibitory regulators of sympathetic norepinephrine release.21 to unequivocally distinguish the cardiovascular
roles of ␣2c- and ␣2b-receptors in vivo, we generated
mice deficient in ␣2a- and ␣2b-receptors. interestingly,
these mice showed a small but significant decrease of
the heart rate in response to the ␣2-agonist dexmedetomidine, which was accompanied by a decrease in aortic
blood pressure. administration of dexmedetomidine
failed to produce the initial hypertension, which can be
attributed to the ␣2b-adrenoceptor subtype18 and the
central hypotensive effect related to the ␣2a-adrenoceptor subtype.26 these findings are consistent with the
observation that activation of presynaptic sympathetic
␣2c-receptors can decrease norepinephrine release.21
etomidate elicited a transient increase in aortic blood
pressure in anesthetized wild-type mice that was not
observed in ␣2b-ko or in ␣2ab-ko mice. the hypertensive response was accompanied by a mild bradycardia.
in humans, the most distinctive property of etomidate as
compared with other anesthetics is its minimal effect on
cardiovascular parameters.2,3 however, several studies
anesthesiology, v 99, no 4, oct 2003

in patients have shown that etomidate may cause transient increases in blood pressure and/or systemic vascular resistance.38,39 thus, during induction of anesthesia
etomidate may interact with vascular ␣2b-adrenoceptors
to elicit a transient hypertensive effect or to counteract
the hypotensive effects of other anesthetics and drugs
used in anesthesia. in addition to a direct effect on
vascular ␣2b-receptors, etomidate may elicit the transient
hypertension by an indirect mechanism. it is tempting to
speculate that increased levels of catecholamines
(caused by etomidate) may contribute to the transient
hypertension. however, wild-type or ␣2-deficient mice
did not show any typical signs of increased norepinephrine secretion; i.e., tachycardia (fig. 4). further studies
on isolated microvessels are required to determine
whether the etomidate-mediated hypertension is indeed
mediated by a direct vasoconstrictory mechanism.
interaction of etomidate with the ␣2a-receptor subtype
is unlikely to play an important role in mediating its
anesthetic action because of the low affinity of etomidate for this receptor subtype. this result is also consistent with the clinical profile of etomidate in humans.
activation of ␣2a-receptors elicits analgesia and inhibits
sympathetic outflow. etomidate does not have significant analgesic effects in humans and it does not block
the sympathetic activation that is usually observed during intubation.40
in conclusion, etomidate can stimulate ␣2b-adrenoceptors in mice, which results in a transient hypertensive
response after rapid intravenous injection. although this
study was performed with transgenic mouse models and
recombinant murine ␣2-adrenoceptors, it is tempting to
speculate about the implications for the mechanism of
action of etomidate in humans. the cardiovascular stability of etomidate during induction of anesthesia even in
patients with cardiac disease and during bolus application might be related to an interaction of etomidate with
peripheral ␣2b-adrenoceptors. the ␣2b-mediated vasoconstriction may oppose hypotensive effects of other
coadministered agents during induction of anesthesia,
and thus be responsible for the known beneficial hemodynamic profile of etomidate.
