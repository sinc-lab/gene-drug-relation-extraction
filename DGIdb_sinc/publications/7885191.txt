summarv
the non-competitive blocker site of the gaba-gated chloride ion channel in
normal susceptible strains of drosoohila melanogaster and simulans binds 4-n[3h]propyl-4’-ethynylbicycloorthobenzoate ([3h]ebob) at specific sites with k,s
of 1.6-1.9 nm and b-s of 171-181 fmol/mg protein. this specific binding of
[3h]eibob is strongly inhibited by: a large number and variety of insecticidal
channel blockers at 20 nm (lindane, a-endosulfan, dieldrin, 12-ketoendrin,
fipronil, and a representative bicycloorthobenzoate and dithiane) or 200 nm
(picrotoxinin); the insecticidal channel activators avermectin and moxidectin at 20
nm; muscimol at 30 fm and gaba at 300 fm. cyclodiene resistance in q.
melanoeaster has been attributed to a mutation resulting in an ala3’* + ser
replacement in the rdl gaba receptor subunit and in d. simulans to an
homologous ala + ser or gly replacement. these mutations are shown here to
greatly reduce [3h]ebob binding, i.~. lower affinity and apparent number of
binding sites. the ala -, ser replacement with both melanoaaster and simulans
almost always reduces the potency in inhibiting [3h]ebob binding of each of
eight channel blockers and of muscimol and gaba. the ala + gly replacement
in d. simulans is generally less effective than the ala * ser modification in
reducing sensitivity to the channel blockers and to muscimol and gaba. the
channel activators avermectin and moxidectin usually retain their inhibitory
potency in the rdl subunit mutants. thus, it appears that replacement of ala by
ser generally modifies the non-competitive blocker site and its coupling to the
gaba-recognition site with less effect on the channel activator site. in contrast,
the ala -dgly replacement has less impact in protecting the chloride channel from
the action of insecticidal blockers. each of the resistant strains has the same level
of resistance to the lethal action of the five channel blockers examined but none
to avermectins and muscimol.

and the very potent metabolite 12-ketoendrin) and structurally-diverse heterocyclic compounds
(c,g. the botanical picrotoxinin, bicycloorthobenzoates, dithianes and the arylpyrazole fipronil)
(1,2). resistance to any one of these insecticides often extends to some or all of the other
channel blockers (l-4). the chloride channel activators avermectin and moxidectin are also
potent insecticides but there is generally little or no cross resistance with the blockers (l-6).
the resistance of houseflies, mosquitoes and cockroaches to dieldrin and picrotoxinin is
associated with reduced binding of [3h]dihydropicrotoxinin (7). these relationships have been
more thoroughly examined with 4-n-[3h]propyl-4’-ethynylbicycloorthobenzoate ([%lebob), an
improved radioligand which directly measures the gaba-gated chloride channel in housefly
head membranes (8). the ebob binding site is the same as, or similar to, that for lindane, 01endosulfan, picrotoxinin and fipronil and is coupled to, but distinct from, the gaba and
avermectin recognition sites (4,8,9,10). a housefly strain resistant to dieldrin and ebob has
a lower affinity ebob binding site [k,, 1.4 nm for the susceptible (5’) and 5.6 nm for the
resistant (r) strain] (8). although not tested, the lower affinity for ebob might apply to some
or all of the other channel blockers. [3h]ebob is also an appropriate radioligand for d.
melanoeaster head membranes with similar properties to the m. domestica membranes (11).
recent advances in the molecular genetics of cyclodiene resistance in drosoohila make this the
best understood insect relative to the structure and function of the gaba-gatcd chloride channel
(3,12-16). dieldrin and picrotoxinin resistance in d. melanogaster involves a point mutation in
the rdl gaba receptor subunit of ala302to ser and in d. simulans of the homologous ala to
ser in some strains and to gly in others. the present investigation utilizes [3h]ebob to
examine the drosonhila gaba-gated chloride channel from two species (melanoeaster and
simulans) and three resistant strains (ala + ser or gly) with two goals: determine if the single
amino acid change alters [3h]ebob binding and if so evaluate the nature of the modification;
define the extent to which these replacements affect the interaction of other insecticides or
neuroactive materials with the insect gaba-gated chloride channel.
methods

inhibitors
the channel blockers and activators used (table i) are described in our earlier studies (1,4,811). cyanobicycloorthobenzoate refers to the 4-set-butyl-4’-cyano analog and ethynylphenyldithiane designates trans-5-ten-butyl-2-(4-ethynylphenyl)-1,3-dithiane.
oriein of suscemible flv strains
the s d. melanoeaster strain with the normal ala302in its chloride channel is referred to here
as mel-ala. it carries two types of third chromosomes, 1.~. a “balance? and a chromosome with
a small deficiency, rdl 2, which is lethal when homozygous and includes the region which
would otherwise carry the s allele (12). the balancer chromosome, 2x43, has a dominant
marker, sb (stubble bristles), which is also lethal when homozygous. the s strain thus carries
only one copy per individual of the s allele, but this has no effect on its susceptibility to dieldrin
(16). when an r strain is crossed to this balancer stock, any individuals bearing s alleles are
marked with sb and easily removed. in any case, as both the balancer and deficiency are lethal
when homozygous, both are eventually lost from the strain. since the r strains were crossed
to this strain to insure homozygosity, me&ala was used as the s strain to minimize the potential
effects of strain-specific genetic backgrounds in the bioassays.

drosophila [3h]ebob binding site

vol. 56, no. 10, 1995

the s d. simulans strain, referred to as sim-ala and collected in davis, california in 1990, was
used for crosses with all r strains before further selection.
origin of resistant flv strains
resistant strains were identified from 80 drosophila populations collected worldwide by
screening with dieldrin as a thin film in a 20-ml glass scintillation vial, initially at a 1 pg dose
(13). surviving males were crossed to s females and the descendants were selected as virgin
females and/or larvae (17) until fewer than 15% of the flies died at 30 pg, as is typical for
homozygous r strains (18). specific resistance mutations were then characterized by pcr-based
sequencing (13) (confirmed by r.t. roush, v. bauer, j.-m. delpuech and c. aquadro,
unpublished).
the r d. melanopaster strain with the mutant sepo2 is referred to as me&r.
it was collected
at apopka, florida in 1991 and, before use in these studies, was re-selected for homozygosity
of resistance after it had been crossed and backcrossed to a recessive white eye mutant bearing
rdl 2/zm3 susceptible line. the white eye mutant has no effect on resistance to several
insecticides (r.t. roush, unpublished) and provided a visual check against any possible
contamination of the r strain by normal-eyed s flies.
the r d. simulans strains with ser at the residue homologous to ala3” in q. melanopaster
(referred to sim-ser) were collected in 1990 at gridley, laconchita and templeton, california.
the simulans strains with gly at this residue (i.e. sim-gly) were obtained from kenya (in 1988),
japan (in 1991) and near soda lake, california (in 1990).
adult flv mortalitv assavs
ld,, values were determined by tarsal contact for the channel blockers and ingestion for
abamectin (mixture of avermectins) and muscimol. for contact assays, the insecticide solution
(0.2-1.0 ml) was introduced in acetone (or acetone containing hexane for ebob) into a 20-ml
glass scintillation vial which was rolled during solvent evaporation to distribute the compound
on the walls as evenly as possible. adult flies (20-30) were added to each vial which was then
stoppered with a cotton plug moistened with 5% sucrose in water. abamectin (18 g/l
emulsifiable concentrate from merck, sharp & dohme agvet) and muscimol were diluted with
or dissolved in 5 % sucrose in water for oral exposure by adding 1.o ml of the preparation to a
small piece of cotton in each vial. mortality was assessed at 24 hr; any fly that could not walk
was considered to be dead.
13h1ebobbinding assavs (11)
the flies were reared in the ithaca laboratory, separated from the media, frozen on dry ice, and
shipped to berkeley. the frozen flies were shaken vigorously to separate the body parts and the
heads were recovered by passing through a cold (dry ice) 20-mesh sieve. the frozen heads were
homogenized in 10 mm tris-hcl buffer @h 7.5) containing 0.25 m sucrose, centrifuged at 500
x g for 5 min, and the supematant filtered through four layers of cheesecloth. the filtrate was
centrifuged at 130,000 g for 1 h and protein determined by the bradford method. fresh
membrane preparations were used for each experiment.
the head membranes were resuspended in 10 mm phosphate buffer (ph 7.5) containing 300 mm
nacl (assay buffer). for inhibition studies, the incubation mixture consisted of 0.75 nm (final
concentration) [3h]ebob (58.4 ci/mmol) in 0.5 ml assay buffer and candidate inhibitors in 5

assay buffer. the mixtures were incubated at 22 oc for 70 min and filtered through gf/b glassfiber filters followed by three 5.0-ml rinses with cold assay buffer. specific binding is the
difference behveen total 3h-bound with 0.75 nm [3h]ebob and non-specific 3h-bound on
addition of 2 pm unlabeled ebob. each experiment was performed 3- to 5times with duplicate
samples. saturation studies used increasing concentrations (9) of [3h]ebob alone or with 2 pm
unlabeled eboibto determine non-specific binding. in each experiment the sand r strains were
used simultaneously, &.g. melanopaster (mel-ala and mel-ser) in one series and simulans (simala, sim-ser and sim-gly) in another series. dissociation constants (i<ds) and the maximum
number of binding sites (b-s) were determined from scatchard plots.

s strains. mel-ala and sim-ala have essentially the same binding parameters. thus, specific
binding was 69 and 76% of total binding for me&ala and sim-ala, respectively, based on the
total and specific binding cpm values of 642 + 179 and 445 f 168 for mef-ala and 758 + 138
and 574 f. 118 for sim-ala (table i). the k, and b, values were 1.9 nm and 171 fmol/mg

(fig. 1).
r strains. the r strains have very different binding parameters than the s strains. specific
binding values for mel-ser, sim-ser and sim-gly, respectively, were 46, 32 and 36% of the total
binding values which were 496 f 53, 310 f 8 1 and 353 + 21 cpm (table i). scatchard plots
established distinctly lower receptor affinities and apparent number of binding sites for the three
r strains versus the two s strains (fig. 1). however, the scatchard plots for the r strains were
based on low cpm values and were inadequate to establish with certainty whether or not the
number of binding sites was changed.

mel-ala and sim-ala were similar to each other in sensitivity to the four
polychlorocycloalkanes and the four other channel blockers (with the possible exceptions of
lindane and 12..ketoendrin). the channel blockers at 20 nm gave inhibition values for specific
binding with the two species of 62-63% for a-endosulfan, 41-43% for dieldrin, 67-87 % for 12ketoendrin, 32-50% for cyanobicycloorthobenzoate, 46-54% for ethynylphenyldithiane, 77-86%
for tipronil, and 19-51% for lindane, as compared to 25-26% for picrotoxinin at 200 nm.

r strains. mei’ser was significantly less sensitive than mel-ala to each of the channel blockers
(except lindane) exemplified by o-15% and 43-53% inhibition of total binding (o-33% and 6777% of specific binding) for the two strains, respectively, by cr-endosulfan, 1zketoendrin and
fipronil. a similar relationship was observed for sim-ser versus sim-ah with significantly lower
sensitivity in the r than the s strain except for lindane, dieldrin and picrotoxinin. sim-gly was
similar to sim-ser in sensitivity to five of the channel blockers but was more sensitive to iyendosulfan, 12-ketoendrin and ethynylphenyldithiane.

in suscemible and resistant strains of drosoohila melanoaaster and simulans (table i\
the s strains, mel-ala and sim-ala, were similar to each other in the levels of inhibition by the

channel activators avermectin and moxidectin at 20 nm, muscimol at 30 pm and gaba at 300
pm. avermectin and moxidectin were equally effective with the r and s strains except for the
apparent lower sensitivity of sim-ser than sim-ala. the r strains mel-ser and sim-ser were
significantly less sensitive to inhibition by muscimol and gaba than the corresponding s strains

discussion
the findings are consistent with current knowledge concerning the mode of action of cyclodienes
and related compounds and the toxicological phenotypes of the strains of d. melanogaster and
q. simulans that were examined (3,19). importantly, these relationships are established directly
and quantitatively at the receptor level by the use of [3h]ebob as a radioligand (8,11). the
substitution of ser for ala in both melanopaster and simulans lowers the extent of [3h]ebob
binding and the sensitivity in general to channel blockers, muscimol and gaba. with these
compounds the substitution of gly for ala is not as effective in reducing inhibition. the effects
of the ala to ser or gly mutations are less clearly defined with the channel activators.
all of these drosophila strains are resistant not only to dieldrin (used for selection) and to ebob
(used as the radioligand probe) but also to the other channel blockers, although not to the
channel activator abamectin and to muscimol (3,19). it appears that similar but possibly not
identical cross-resistance patterns are associated with the two types of point mutation, i.e., ala
to ser or gly. the sim-gly strain is more resistant to poisoning than predicted from the

764

drosophila [3h]ebobbindingsite

vol. 56, no. 10,1995

receptor assays. the differences in these two measures of resistance may be influenced by
detoxification rates, pg. greater for the sim-gly strain, or may reflect a limitation in faithfully
reproducing the in vivo relationship in the ebob binding assay.
the cyclodiene resistance-associated mutation in z2. melanoeaster and simulans involving the ala
+ ser replacement is also found in rdz homologues of musca domestica, tribolium castaneum,
and blattella germanica (incorrectly identified as periolaneta americana) (20) as well as aedes
aegvnti (21). these studies of the molecular and population genetics of cyclodiene resistance
can now be correlated with findings on the physiology of action involving destabilization of the
cyclodiene-favored conformation and on binding site affinity (22), as in the present investigation.
distinctly lower receptor affinities for [3h]ebob are observed in resistant drosonhila and
musca without a change in the number of binding sites with musca but this relationship is not
established for tribolium, blattella or aedes. this is the clearest illustration to date of the
impact of these changes in conferring cross-resistance to channel blockers of several chemical
types.
