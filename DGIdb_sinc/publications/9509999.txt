abstract
the effects of several  xxxd1773xxx  (camp)-elevating agents on the proliferation of cultured rat microglia
were investigated by immunocytochemical staining with an antibody against  xxxg1681xxx  (pcna). epinephrine,  xxxd2401xxx ,  xxxd1742xxx  and  xxxd595xxx -camp suppressed the microglial proliferation. a b2-selective agonist terbutaline but not a
b1-selective agonist dobutamine mimicked the effect of the above camp-elevating agents. furthermore, a non-selective breceptor antagonist  xxxd2812xxx  and a b2-selective antagonist acebutalol, but not a b1-selective antagonist butoxamine, counteracted the suppressive effects of the b-agonists on microglial proliferation. these findings suggest that the b-agonists suppress
the proliferation of microglia by elevating intracellular camp level through an action on b2-adrenergic receptor.  1998 elsevier

microglia as a significant component of the central nervous system (cns) form a neuron-glia network to play an
important role in immune responses within the cns [7,17].
microglia in the normal mature brain do not proliferate and
downregulate the macrophage-like properties such as phagocytosis and macrophage marker expression [11]. such
microglial cells are called resting cells. on the other hand,
during various pathological processes including degenerative neurological diseases and ischemia-induced neuronal
death, microglia actively proliferate, change their ramified
shape into an ameboid one and begin to phagocytose degenerating cells. this type of cell in the pathological brain is
called activated microglia. the activated microglia can
secrete neurotoxic substances as well as potentially neuroprotective factors [2,4,17,21]. the question of whether such
activated microglia in the pathological brain facilitate or
prevent neuronal survival has been open to debate over
the decade [11,14].
even though we can not completely unravel the effects of

microglia on neuronal survival, it appears to be of value
from the clinical point of view to control the activity of
microglia in the pathological brain by using peripherally
administered pharmacon. suppression of microglial proliferation may be the most effective method of inhibiting the
generation of harmful substances such as  xxxd2738xxx  and
superoxide anion and in changing the clinical course of
brain diseases and injuries. to ascertain this speculation,
the effects of several kinds of drugs on cultured microglia
have been investigated. we have shown that corticosteroids
suppress macrophage-like properties and proliferation of
microglia through  xxxg1601xxx  [22]. an increase
in intracellular 3′5′- xxxd1773xxx 
(camp) level has also been demonstrated to attenuate the
neurotoxicity of microglia [3,24]. however, it has not been
elucidated whether the elevation of intracellular camp
directly suppresses microglial proliferation or not. in the
present study, we focused on the effects of b-adrenergic
agonists on the proliferation of cultured rat microglia.
microglial cells were obtained from the mixed cell culture of new born rat forebrains as described elsewhere
[5,23]. the purity of microglial cells in culture was over

supplemented with 3% fcs alone. (b) in the presence of 30 mm of epinephrine, only a small number of cells were pcna-positive. the cells
indicated with arrows were counted as positive cells. scale bar, 100 mm.

98%. microglial cells were cultured on glass coverslips for
48 h in dmem containing 3% fetal calf serum (fcs) alone,
3% fcs with camp-elevating agents or 3% fcs with badrenergic receptor antagonists. then, they were fixed with
chilled methanol for 20 min for the subsequent pcna
immunostaining [22]. the number of cells with pcna-positive nucleus was counted as proliferating cells under a light
microscope with nomarski optics. all experiments were in
duplicate. statistical analyses were performed by the analysis of variance followed by fisher’s post-hoc test.
fig. 1 shows the results of immunocytochemical staining
of pcna. when they were cultured in dmem supplemented with 3% fcs, a high percentage of microglial cells with
positively stained nucleus was observed (fig. 1a). in the
presence of 30 mm of epinephrine, pcna-positive cells
markedly decreased in number (fig. 1b). since pcna is
exclusively expressed in cells during s phase, the percentage of pcna-positive cells may reflect the proliferation
rate of microglial cells. with the use of pcna immunocytochemistry and cell-counting, changes in the rate of microglial proliferation in response to several camp-elevating
agents were investigated. epinephrine suppressed the proliferation of microglia in a concentration-dependent manner
(fig. 2). when 30 mm of epinephrine was added to the
culture medium, the pcna-positive cells was 13.0%
which was one third of the control value (39.3%). similar
results were obtained in cultures using three other lots of
fcs (data not shown).  xxxd2401xxx ,  xxxd1742xxx ,  xxxd595xxx -camp
and terbutaline (b2-selective agonist) also significantly suppressed microglial proliferation, while dobutamine, a b1selective agonist, increased the number of pcna-positive
microglial cells (fig. 3a). furthermore, butoxamine (b2antagonist) and  xxxd2812xxx  (non-selective antagonist) but
 xxxd58xxx  (b1-antagonist) abolished the inhibitory effects
of epinephrine and  xxxd2401xxx  on microglial proliferation
(fig. 3b).
thus, we demonstrated that b-adrenergic agonists as well
as the adenylyl cyclase activator  xxxd1742xxx  and the mem-

brane-permeable camp analogue  xxxd595xxx -camp were capable
of suppressing microglial proliferation through their direct
actions on microglial cells. the experiments with  xxxd1742xxx 
and  xxxd595xxx -camp indicate that the rise in intracellular camp
concentration induced the suppression of microglial proliferation. high camp level induced by b-agonists or  xxxd1903xxx  has been shown to link to the suppression of
inos activity [16] and superoxide production in microglia
[3,24]. therefore, the rise in camp level seems to inhibit
the functions of microglia. in the present study, we have first
shown that the camp elevating agents suppress the proliferation of microglial cells.
since (1) a b2-selective agonist terbutaline but not a b1selective agonist dobutamine mimicked the suppressive
effect of epinephrine or  xxxd2401xxx  on microglial prolif-

b2-receptor [10]. thus, both astrocytes and microglial cells
functionally express b2-receptor in vitro. yet, it has been
demonstrated that the principal glial cell type expressing
b2-receptor in vivo is the astrocyte but not the microglia
[1,15]. the possibility of b2-receptor expression in microglia in vivo, however, cannot be excluded taken the limitation of methods used so far [15]. further study is needed by
employing sensitive methods to reveal whether microglial
cells actually express b2-receptor protein or its mrna.
granulocyte/macrophage  xxxg526xxx  ( xxxg526xxx ) has been shown to enhance microglial proliferation
[12], which leads to a decrease in the level of intracellular
camp [20]. this supports our speculation that elevation of
intracellular camp level suppress microglial proliferation.
similarly, astrocytes [6], fibroblasts [25] and bone marrowderived macrophages [9] also downregulate their proliferation in response to elevation of intracellular camp level.
however, lipopolysaccharide and interferon-g which suppress the proliferation of microglial cells and peripheral
macrophages, are known to decrease intracellular camp
level [19]. these conflicting data suggest that microglial
proliferation is regulated by two distinct camp-mediated
pathways as described elsewhere [8,18].
this study was partly supported by grants from the
ministry of education, science, sports and culture of
japan.

camp-elevating agents on microglial proliferation. epinephrine (5
mm),  xxxd2401xxx  (1 mm),  xxxd595xxx -camp (500 mm),  xxxd1742xxx  (10 mm)
and a b2-agonist, terbutaline (1 mm) significantly suppressed the
proliferation. dobutamine (1 mm), a b1-adrenergic receptor agonist,
facilitated microglial proliferation. (b) effects of b-adrenergic antagonists on the suppression of microglial proliferation by epinephrine (5
mm) and  xxxd2401xxx  (5 mm). epinephrine and  xxxd2401xxx  significantly suppressed the proliferation (shown as (−)). the suppression
was abolished by  xxxd2812xxx  (100 mm), a non-selective-adrenergic
antagonist and by butoxamine (100 mm), a b2-adrenergic antagonist.
 xxxd58xxx  (100 mm), a b1-adrenergic antagonist, was ineffective.
antagonists alone did not cause any significant changes in microglial proliferation. data from seven and five independent duplicate
cultures in (a) and (b), respectively, were expressed as the
mean ± sem. in each experiment an average of 400 cells were
counted. *p , 0.05, **p , 0.01, ***p , 0.001 versus control.

eration and (2) a b2-selective antagonist butoxamine but not
a b1-selective antagonist  xxxd58xxx  counteracted the
actions of epinephrine and  xxxd2401xxx , the suppression
of microglial proliferation by epinephrine and  xxxd2401xxx 
appears to be mediated by b2-receptor. the involvement of
b2-adrenergic receptor in the control of glial functions has
been indicated elsewhere. to be more specific, norepinephrine is known to stimulate il-6 secretion from astrocytes by
way of an action on b2-receptor [13].  xxxd2401xxx  has been
shown to inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis
factor-a release from microglial cells through the binding to
