the dextropropoxyphene controversy

keywords: analgesics; dextropropoxyphene; coproxamol; marketing withdrawal

dextropropoxyphene is a weak opioid that was first introduced half a century ago as an analgesic in the usa.
dextropropoxyphene combined with acetaminophen, or coproxamol, rapidly became the most widely prescribed analgesic
throughout the world [1,2]. however, dextropropoxyphene lost
its marketing license in switzerland in 2003, in sweden in
2005, and in the uk in 2007. the european medicines agency
(emea) has started a referral procedure that may lead to the
withdrawal of the marketing license for dextropropoxyphene
throughout the european union. what explains the sudden fall
into disgrace of this hugely popular drug that is valued worldwide for its strong safety record [1,3,4]?

1. doubts about efﬁcacy
dextropropoxyphene is a weak opioid that is chemically similar to methadone and acts as an agonist of the ␮ receptors
[1]. until 2001, dextropropoxyphene was available in france
as the hydrochloride salt in a single-drug preparation containing
65 mg per tablet (antalvic® ). the license was held at the time
by hoechst-houdé inc., who discontinued the drug, a decision
that was met with indifference by the public and professionals
alike.
doubts about the efficacy of dextropropoxyphene come
mainly from studies in patients with acute postoperative pain,
used as a model of acute pain.  xxxd3031xxx  65 mg and its close relative dextropropoxyphene napsylate
100 mg exhibited only modest effects, comparable to those
of 500 mg of acetaminophen, 50 mg of tramadol, or 60 mg of
codeine; and far smaller than those of 400 mg of ibuprofen or
50 mg of diclofenac [5]. unfortunately, there are no randomized controlled trials of the efficacy of dextropropoxyphene
on chronic pain [6]. however, a brief (2-week) trial suggests
that dextropropoxyphene napsylate (300 mg/d) may be as effective as tramadol (300 mg/d) in patients with pain from knee or
hip osteoarthritis and may be associated with a lower rate of
treatment discontinuations related to adverse events (11% vs
36%) [6]. however, this study has serious methodological weaknesses, including absence of a placebo arm, and consequently

its results cannot be used to draw conclusions about the role for
dextropropoxyphene in the management of osteoarthritis [6].
furthermore, dextropropoxyphene as a single-drug preparation
has fallen into disuse.
coproxamol, in contrast, is extremely popular among patients
and physicians. however, studies of coproxamol found no proof
of greater efficacy compared to acetaminophen alone [4]. in
patients with acute postoperative pain, oral administration of
65 mg of  xxxd3031xxx  with 650 mg of
acetaminophen had the same effect as 100 mg of oral tramadol
or 1 g of oral acetaminophen and a far smaller effect than oral
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) [5]. the effects
of the single doses used in most clinical trials may fail to reflect
the effects of long-term coproxamol therapy [7], as suggested
by pharmacokinetic data [8]. the mean plasma elimination
half-life of dextropropoxyphene and its active metabolite norpropoxyphene is 22 hours in young adults and 37–42 hours in
older individuals, so that accumulation occurs with repeateddose therapy, possibly potentiating the analgesic effect [7,8].
in a double-blind trial, most patients on long-term coproxamol
therapy for joint disease felt that the drug was more effective than acetaminophen alone [9]. nevertheless, the efficacy
of coproxamol will remain in doubt until studies establish its
superiority over acetaminophen in patients with chronic pain,
including patients with pain from osteoarthritis. the uncertainty regarding the analgesic efficacy of coproxamol applies
to all currently marketed combination tablets of acetaminophen
and dextropropoxyphene. the coproxamol preparation available
in france (di-antalvic® ) contains 400 mg of acetaminophen
and 30 mg of  xxxd3031xxx , compared to
325 mg and 32.5 mg, respectively, in the preparation available
in the uk. another preparation (propofan® ) contains 400 mg of
acetaminophen, 27 mg of  xxxd3031xxx ,
and 30 mg of caffeine.

2. a strong safety record
serum alkaline phosphatase elevation is common during
coproxamol treatment; and cholestatic or mixed hepatitis is a

well-known, although usually asymptomatic, adverse effect of
dextropropoxyphene [10]. hypoglycemia is far less common
and occurs chiefly in the very elderly and in patients with renal
failure [11,12]. notwithstanding these adverse effects, clinical
experience suggests that the greatest quality of coproxamol is
probably an excellent safety profile. this opinion is supported
by the results of a randomized double-blind trial comparing
acetaminophen plus dextropropoxyphene to acetaminophen plus
codeine for 1 week in 141 patients [3]. adverse events requiring
study withdrawal were three times more common with codeine
(27/71, 38%) than with dextropropoxyphene (9/70, 13%). when
used in standard dosages, coproxamol is associated with fairly
low rates of nausea, vomiting, constipation, drowsiness, and
dizziness, which are the main reasons for discontinuing opioid
therapy [3,6].
the gastrointestinal and neuropsychological side effects of
opioids can be expected to mirror their analgesic effects, as both
are related to ␮ receptor stimulation. therefore, the good safety
profile of coproxamol may merely reflect its limited efficacy
[6]. none of the available coproxamol preparations contains
the dosages corresponding to a step 2 analgesic, according to
the recommendations on cancer pain treatment issued by the
world health organization [13]. to be more effective than step
1 drugs,i.e., acetaminophen or an nsaid, acetaminophen 500
mg should be combined with 50-100 mg of dextropropoxyphene
[13].
3. yet, coproxamol can kill
in the 1970s and 1980s, reports of large numbers of deaths
caused by coproxamol overdosage were a matter of great concern to health care authorities, particularly in the uk, canada,
the us, australia and the scandinavian countries [1,2]. a retrospective review of suicide deaths recorded in england and wales
indicated that coproxamol alone caused 255 deaths per year
(95% confidence interval [95% ci]: 238–274) in 1997–1999,
compared to 309 (95% ci: 289–330) for tricyclic antidepressants and 123 (95% ci: 110–136) for acetaminophen [14]. the
relative risk (rr) of death was higher with coproxamol than
with imipramine antidepressants (rr: 2.3; 95% ci: 2.1–2.5) or
acetaminophen (rr: 28.1; 95% ci: 24.9–32.9) [14]. a survey
conducted in scotland over the 2-year period from july 2000
to june 2002 showed that coproxamol overdosage caused 24.6
deaths/106 prescriptions (95% ci: 19.7–30.4) compared to two
deaths (0.88–4) for combinations of acetaminophen (500 mg)
and codeine (8, 15, or 30 mg) and 2.4 deaths (0.5–7.2) for combinations of acetaminophen (500 mg) and dihydrocodeine (10 or
20 mg), although the incidence of self-poisoning was similar for
the three categories of analgesics [15]. an earlier study found a
close association between the amount of coproxamol delivered
by prescription and the number of deaths by overdosage in north
america and northern europe [2].
because coproxamol is rapidly absorbed by the intestine, lethal plasma levels of dextropropoxyphene and norpropoxyphene may be reached rapidly after ingestion [1]. the
mean time from ingestion to death is about 5 hours, and 80
to 90% of deaths from dextropropoxyphene overdosage occur

before hospital admission [2]. the first cause of death is central
nervous system depression, which causes impaired consciousness and hypoventilation. these effects are typical of opioids
and can be reversed by injecting a ␮ receptor antagonist such as
naloxone, although they are often potentiated by the concomitant
ingestion of alcohol or psychoactive drugs such as benzodiazepines [1,2,15]. dextropropoxyphene and, to an even greater
degree, norpropoxyphene impair heart function, probably by
interfering with the sodium and potassium channels. this effect,
which is not reversed by naloxone, may lead to decreased contractility, asystole, bradycardia, qrs prolongation, and qtc
prolongation [1,15,16].
4. should coproxamol be banned?
mounting a defense against such damning charges may seem
unrealistic. here is a drug that has earned a reputation of
being dangerous yet fails to induce greater relief of acute pain
than acetaminophen and, despite its long-standing popularity,
remains untested in chronic pain, its indication of choice. the
withdrawal of coproxamol in the uk (which was gradual, to
give physicians time to find alternative treatments) was associated with a decrease in the number of self-poisoning deaths,
despite the use of other analgesics as substitutes [17].
nevertheless, coproxamol still has strong advocates. some
patients fail to find acceptable alternatives [18,19]. the overwhelming majority of general practitioners and rheumatologists
in the uk want the drug to stay on the market [18]. they argue
that coproxamol is the only satisfactory analgesic for some
patients with chronic pain, who use it appropriately and have
no suicidal tendencies. depriving such patients of coproxamol
may be considered unethical [19]. an additional argument in
favor of keeping coproxamol in france comes from a report
by the poison control center: of 12,444 coproxamol overdoses
recorded between 1995 and 2003, only 62 were fatal, yielding a
mean of seven deaths per year [20]. this result may be ascribable to the low level of use of analgesics for suicide in france
[20]. if coproxamol is not dangerous in our country, why remove
it from our pharmacopoeia, given its considerable usefulness in
some patients?
it is to be hoped that the decision taken by the emea will
take local considerations into account instead of instituting a ban
for the entire european union. a useful approach would be to
ask the health care authorities of countries where coproxamol
remains available to conduct clinical trials versus acetaminophen
in patients with chronic pain.
