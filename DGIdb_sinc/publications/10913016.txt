ventricular cardiomyocytes from adult rat. am j physiol cell
physiol 279:  xxxd2370xxx –c503, 2000.—we investigated whether
selective ␤1-adrenoceptor stimulation causes hypertrophic
growth on isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes from adult
rat. as parameters for the induction of hypertrophic growth,
the increases of [14c]phenylalanine incorporation, protein
and rna mass, and cell size were determined.  xxxd2401xxx 
(iso, 10 ␮m) alone had no growth effect. in the presence of the
␤2-adrenoceptor antagonist ici-118551 (ici, 10 ␮m), iso
caused an increase in [14c]phenylalanine incorporation, protein and rna mass, cell volume, and cross-sectional area. we
showed for phenylalanine incorporation that the growth effect of iso⫹ici could be antagonized by ␤1-adrenoceptor
blockade with atenolol (10 ␮m) or metoprolol (10 ␮m), indicating that it was caused by selective ␤1-adrenoceptor stimulation. the growth response to iso⫹ici was accompanied by
an increase in  xxxg1626xxx  (odc) activity and
expression. inhibition of odc by the odc antagonist  xxxd2430xxx  (1 mm) attenuated this hypertrophic response, indicating that odc induction is causally involved.
the growth response to iso⫹ici was found to be camp
independent but was sensitive to genistein (100 ␮m) or
rapamycin (0.1 ␮m). the reaction was enhanced in the presence of pertussis toxin (10 ␮m). we conclude that selective
␤1-adrenoceptor stimulation causes hypertrophic growth of
ventricular cardiomyocytes by a mechanism that is independent of camp but dependent on a  xxxg2198xxx  and odc.

of the sympathetic nerve system normally accompanies myocardial hypertrophy and subsequent heart failure (18). in vivo, ␤-adrenoceptor stimulation by  xxxd2401xxx , a nonselective ␤-adrenoceptor
agonist, causes myocardial hypertrophy, and, at least
in some cases, application of ␤-adrenoceptor antagonists reduces myocardial hypertrophy independently of
hemodynamic effects (1,2). in vitro, isolated cardiomyocytes increase protein and rna synthesis in response
to the ␣-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (14). they
do not, however, respond to  xxxd2401xxx  in respect to
hypertrophic growth (21). the influence of ␤2-adreno-

ceptor inhibition on hypertrophy caused by  xxxd2401xxx , resulting in ␤1-adrenoceptor subtype-specific stimulation, has not been investigated.
in the present study we investigated whether selective stimulation by ␤1-adrenoceptors induces hypertrophic growth on cardiomyocytes isolated from ventricles
of adult rats. the cells were stimulated under various
pharmacological conditions, i.e., with  xxxd2401xxx  in
the presence of the ␤2-adrenoceptor antagonist ici118551, an inhibitor of ␤2-adrenoceptors, or with norepinephrine and an ␣-adrenoceptor blocker that also
produces a preferential ␤1-adrenoceptor stimulation.
these treatments were aimed to mimic a pathophysiological situation in which autoantibodies directed
against ␤1-adrenoceptors may selectively stimulate ␤1adrenoceptors (25). in vivo, the hypertrophic response
to ␤-adrenoceptor stimulation is accompanied by an
induction of  xxxg1626xxx  (odc), and inhibition of odc attenuates the hypertrophic response
(2). therefore, we further investigated, in isolated cardiomyocytes, whether selective ␤1-adrenoceptor stimulation induces odc and whether odc induction is
causally involved in its hypertrophic effect.
in another series of experiments we characterized
the hypertrophic response of cardiomyocytes to ␤1adrenoceptor stimulation in respect to several key elements of intracellular signal transduction. in previous
studies from our group on the same experimental
model (21), we found that neither a nonselective ␤-adrenoceptor stimulation nor direct stimulation of campdependent protein kinases by dibutyryl-camp increases protein or rna synthesis. this led us to
hypothesize that the ␤1-adrenoceptor mediates its hypertrophic effect in a camp-independent manner. because ␤1-adrenoceptor-mediated signaling pathways
have also been shown to depend on the activation of
genistein-sensitive tyrosine kinases (26), we further
investigated whether tyrosine kinases participate in
the intracellular signaling pathway. in a more general
way, activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi
3-kinase) and p70s6k need to be activated by different
intracellular signaling pathways that lead to hypertrophic growth of adult cardiomyocytes (20, 24). there-

hypertrophic effect of ␤1-adrenoceptor stimulation

fore, we hypothesized that these two kinases are part
of the intracellular signaling event caused by selective
␤1-adrenoceptor stimulation and leading to hypertrophic growth. the different intracellular signaling steps
were inhibited with the use of specific inhibitors. finally, we investigated whether pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of g␣i and g␣o, influences the hypertrophic
response to selective ␤1-adrenoceptor stimulation, because pertussis toxin was found to increase the sensitivity to ␤1-adrenoceptors (13).
materials

cell culture. ventricular heart muscle cells were isolated
from 200- to 250-g male wistar rats as previously described
(21). isolated cells were suspended in fetal calf serum (fcs)free culture medium and plated at a density of 1.4 ⫻ 105
elongated cells/35-mm culture dish (falcon type 3001). the
culture dishes had been preincubated overnight with 4% fcs
in medium 199. the basic culture medium consisted of medium 199 with earle’s salts, 5 mm creatine, 2 mm l-carnitine, 5 mm taurine, 100 iu/ml penicillin, and 100 ␮g/ml
streptomycin. to prevent growth of nonmyocytes, media were
also supplemented with 10 ␮m cytosine-␤-d-arabinofuranoside.
four hours after plating, cultures were washed twice with
culture medium to remove round and nonattached cells and
were supplied with fcs-free experimental medium, in which
cells were incubated for a 24-h period at 37°c. the experiments were carried out in basic culture medium (control),
with additions of agonists at the concentrations indicated.
 xxxd228xxx  (100 ␮m) was added to all cultures as an
antioxidant.
incorporation of [14c]phenylalanine and changes in cellular protein and rna mass. incorporation of phenylalanine
into cells was determined by exposing cultures to l-[14c]phenylalanine (0.1 ␮ci/ml) for 24 h and measuring the incorporation of radioactivity into an acid-insoluble cell mass as
described previously (21). nonradioactive phenylalanine (0.3
mm) was added to the medium to minimize variations in the
specific activity of the precursor pool responsible for protein
synthesis. in incorporation studies, experiments were terminated by removing the supernatant medium from the cultures and washing three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pbs; composition in mm: 1.5 kh2po4, 137 nacl,
2.7 kcl, and 1.0 na2hpo4, ph 7.4). subsequently, ice-cold
10% (wt/vol) trichloroacetic acid was added. after storage
overnight at 4°c, the acid was removed from the dishes.
radioactivity contained in this acid fraction was taken to
represent the intracellular precursor pool. the dishes were
then washed twice with ice-cold pbs. the remaining precipitate on the culture dishes was dissolved in 1 n naoh-0.01%
(wt/vol)  xxxd3215xxx  by an incubation for 2 h at
37°c. in these samples, protein (6) and dna contents (10)
were determined, and the radioactivity was counted. rna
was determined from an aliquot of these samples after precipitation with an equal volume of 10% (wt/vol) perchloric
acid in the remaining supernatant (15). the rna content
was expressed relative to the dna content of the samples.
cell morphology. cell morphology was determined as described earlier (22). myocyte growth was determined on
phase-contrast micrographs recorded on tape using a chargecoupled device video camera. cell volumes were calculated by
the following formula: volume ⫽ (radius)2 ⫻ ␲⫻ length,
assuming a cylindrical cell shape. cross-sectional area was
determined by the following formula: cross-sectional area ⫽

(radius)2 ⫻ ␲. cell viability was determined using trypan
blue extrusion assay.
odc activity. the activity of odc was determined as
described in ref. 16. cardiomyocyte cultures were washed
twice with ice-cold pbs, scraped off, and centrifuged for 2
min at 3,000 g. the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer
(composition in mm: 10 tris 䡠 hcl, 250 sucrose, 5 dithiothreitol, 1 edta, and 0.5  xxxd3047xxx , ph 7.3) and homogenized by sonification. the homogenate was centrifuged
again for 2 min at 3,000 g. this supernatant was used to
determine odc activity. odc activity in the supernatants
was determined by the release of [14c]co2 from l-[14c]ornithine. the supernatant (50 ␮l) and lysis buffer (250 ␮l)
including 0.1 ␮ci/ml l-[14c]-ornithine and 3 mm ornithine
were incubated for 30 min in a closed tube equipped with
filter paper wetted in 1 n koh to trap released co2. the
reaction was terminated by incubation overnight at 4°c to
adsorb released co2. to estimate nonspecific co2 release
during the incubation, blank tubes were set up and the
nonspecific release was subtracted from the sample release.
the filter papers were removed, and trapped [14c]co2 was
counted by liquid scintillation.
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. total
rna from cardiomyocytes was extracted with rna-clean
(ags, heidelberg, germany) as described by the manufacturer. reverse transcription reactions were performed for 1 h
at 37°c in a final volume of 10 ␮l using 1 ␮g of rna, 100 ng
of oligo(dt)15 (boehringer mannheim, germany), 1 mm
dntps (gibco brl), 8 units of rnase block (promega,
mannheim, germany), and 60 units of moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (gibco brl). aliquots
(1.5 ␮l) of the synthesized cdna were used for polymerase
chain reaction (pcr) in a final volume of 10 ␮l containing 1.5
␮m primer pairs, 0.4 mm dntps, 1.5 mm mgcl2, and 1 unit
of taq polymerase (gibco brl). amplification was performed under the following cycle conditions: 1 min at 93°c, 1
min at 57°c, and 3 min at 72°c. for each assayed gene, the
number of cycles resulting in a linear amplification range
was tested. oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by
gibco brl and had the following sequences: ␤-actin, sense
5⬘-gaagtgtgacgttgacatccg-3⬘ and antisense 5⬘-tgctgatccacatctgctgga-3⬘, for amplification between
2,731 and 3,081 bp of rat ␤-actin gene (19); and odc, sense
5⬘-gaagatgagtcaaacgagca-3⬘ and antisense 5⬘-agtagatgtttggcctctgg-3⬘, for amplification between
5,777 and 6,352 bp of rat odc gene (27).
after amplification reaction products were separated on
5% polyacrylamide gels, they were stained with ethidium
bromide and photographed under ultraviolet illumination.
for quantification, the densities of the dna fragments were
determined by imagequant (molecular dynamics, krefeld,
germany). the results for odc expression were normalized
for ␤-actin expression.
statistics. data are given as means ⫾ se from n different
culture preparations. statistical comparisons were performed by one-way analysis of variance and with the use of
the student-newman-keuls test for post hoc analysis (11). in
exceptional cases only two groups were compared. in these
cases, student’s t-test was performed. differences with p ⬍
0.05 were regarded as statistically significant. all data were
computed using sas software (version 6.11; sas institute,
cary, nc).
cell contraction. cell contractions were analyzed as described previously (17, 22). briefly, cardiomyocytes were
paced at a constant frequency (0.5 hz), and cell contractions
were monitored by using a line camera. the contractile

results

hypertrophic effect of selective stimulation of ␤1-adrenoceptors. isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes from
adult rat were used under serum-free conditions to
study the influence of ␤-adrenoceptor stimulation on
[14c]phenylalanine incorporation. the cells remained
mechanically quiescent throughout the experiments.
 xxxd2401xxx , applied at a saturating concentration of
10 ␮m (17), had no effect on phenylalanine incorporation. the additional presence of the ␤2-adrenoceptor
antagonist ici-118551 gradually increased [14c]phenylalanine incorporation when applied at increasing
concentrations. a maximal increase was obtained at 1
␮m ici-118551, and no further change was observed at
10 ␮m ici-118551 (fig. 1a). the maximal effect
achieved by  xxxd2401xxx  in the presence of ici118551 reached 47% of the maximal effect evoked by
␣-adrenoceptor stimulation with phenylephrine (10
␮m), which was used as a control (100%).
in a second series of experiments the concentration
of ici-118551 was fixed  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m, and the concentration of  xxxd2401xxx  was increased. in the presence of
ici-118551,  xxxd2401xxx  caused a concentration-dependent increase in protein synthesis, reaching significance at 3 ␮m (fig. 1b). the  xxxd2401xxx  effect was

not saturated up to 30 ␮m. because it is known that
 xxxd2401xxx  at concentrations ⬎10 ␮m can stimulate
␣-adrenoceptors, all further experiments were performed with 10 ␮m  xxxd2401xxx . in some of the experiments this was combined with an equimolar dose
of ici-118551.
in the absence of ici-118551,  xxxd2401xxx  (10 ␮m)
did not increase [14c]phenylalanine incorporation, protein mass, or rna mass (fig. 2). in the presence of this
␤2-adrenoceptor antagonist (10 ␮m), however,  xxxd2401xxx  increased all three parameters. similar results
were also observed when the concentrations of  xxxd2401xxx  and ici-118551 were reduced from 10 ␮m to
100 nm. again,  xxxd2401xxx  in the presence of
equimolar amounts of ici-118551 caused a significant
increase in [14c]phenylalanine incorporation of 18 ⫾
7% (p ⬍ 0.05 vs. untreated control cultures, n ⫽ 16). a
selective ␤2-adrenoceptor stimulation with  xxxd3017xxx 
(10 ␮m) did not cause hypertrophic growth (fig. 2). all
the hypertrophic parameters investigated were normalized to the dna content of the culture dishes to
diminish variations in cell number between different
culture preparations. dna contents did not change
among groups. the mean dna content in control cultures was 29.0 ⫾ 1.1 ␮g; in the presence of  xxxd2401xxx ,  xxxd2401xxx  plus ici-118551, and  xxxd3017xxx  it
amounted to 31.5 ⫾ 3.2, 30.8 ⫾ 3.7, and 30.4 ⫾ 6.1 ␮g,
respectively. induction of hypertrophy under equimolar concentrations of  xxxd2401xxx  and ici-118551 was
confirmed by the analysis of cell morphology. stimulation by  xxxd2401xxx  plus ici-118551 increased cell
length by 9.7%, cell width by 16.8%, cell volume by
46.2%, and cross-sectional area by 31.3% within 24 h

cardiomyocytes were cultured for 24 h under basal conditions or
with additions of  xxxd2401xxx  (iso, 10 ␮m) and ici-118551 (ici, 10
␮m). thereafter, cell size was determined on phase-contrast micrographs recorded on tape using a charge-coupled device camera.
values are means ⫾ se of 5 culture preparations; 119 cells treated
with iso ⫹ ici and 99 cells without further additions were analyzed
and the increase (⌬) in parameters determined. a t-test was performed to compare the 2 groups, and the p values are indicated.

118551 did not change the gross morphology of the
cells except for the aforementioned changes in cell size
(fig. 3). cell viability was not changed. under control
conditions, 0.4 ⫾ 0.1% of all cells stained positively
with trypan blue. in the presence of  xxxd2401xxx  plus
ici-118551 the number of trypan blue-positive cells
was 0.6 ⫾ 0.2% [not significant (ns) vs. control, n ⫽ 5
preparations]. in conclusion, these studies indicated
that selective ␤1-adrenoceptor stimulation is required
to stimulate a cellular growth response. this was also
confirmed by the following experiments. the effect of
 xxxd2401xxx  plus ici-118551 on [14c]phenylalanine
incorporation could be antagonized concentration dependently by the ␤1-adrenoceptor antagonists atenolol
or metoprolol (fig. 4). it was not antagonized by the
␣-adrenoceptor antagonist  xxxd3000xxx  (10 ␮m). the presence of  xxxd3000xxx  abolished, however, the hypertrophic
effect of phenylephrine (10 ␮m), an ␣-adrenoceptor
agonist used as a positive control.
in a further set of experiments yet another approach
was used to demonstrate the ability of ␤1-adrenoceptor
stimulation to promote protein synthesis (fig. 5). cardiomyocytes were exposed to norepinephrine (1 ␮m),
which is known to stimulate ␤1- and ␣-adrenoceptors.
in the presence of the ␤-blocker propranolol (10 ␮m),
norepinephrine produced a 41% rise in [14c]phenylalanine incorporation, linked to ␣-adrenoceptor stimulation. in the presence of the ␣-blocker  xxxd3000xxx  (10 ␮m),
norepinephrine produced a 21% rise, linked to ␤1-adrenoceptor stimulation. the combination of  xxxd3000xxx 
(10 ␮m) and the ␤1-selective antagonist atenolol (10
␮m) abolished the growth effect of norepinephrine. in
contrast, the combination of  xxxd3000xxx  with the ␤2-selective antagonist ici-118551 (1 ␮m) left the same
growth effect of norepinephrine as that of  xxxd3000xxx 
alone. when  xxxd3000xxx  was combined with the ␤2-adrenoceptor agonist  xxxd3017xxx , the growth effect of norepinephrine was again abolished. these experiments
showed that the growth effect of norepinephrine remaining after ␣-blockade is caused by ␤1-adrenoceptor
stimulation and can be inhibited by ␤2-adrenoceptor
stimulation.

induction of  xxxg1626xxx  by ␤1-adrenoceptor stimulation. we investigated whether selective
␤1-adrenoceptor stimulation induces odc in isolated
cardiomyocytes and whether this induction is causally
involved in the mechanism by which ␤1-adrenoceptor
stimulation increases protein and rna mass. in the
presence of  xxxd2401xxx  plus ici-118551, odc activity doubled within 2 h after agonist addition and remained elevated for the following 2 h (fig. 6). an
increase in odc mrna accompanied the increase in
odc activity as illustrated in fig. 7a. nonselective
stimulation of ␤-adrenoceptors with  xxxd2401xxx 
alone did not induce odc activity or increase its expression (fig. 7b). addition of the odc inhibitor di-

key elements of intracellular signaling that might be

used to inhibit pi 3-kinase activation.  xxxd3536xxx  did
not modify the increase in [14c]phenylalanine incorporation in response to ␤1-adrenoceptor stimulation (table 2). in contrast,  xxxd3536xxx  inhibited the hypertrophic response evoked by phenylephrine in the same
culture model (20). when applied alone, none of these
inhibitors changed the basal levels of [14c]phenylalanine incorporation, protein mass, or rna mass (fig. 9
and table 2).
finally, we investigated whether an inhibition of pertussis toxin-sensitive g proteins influences the growth
response to ␤1-adrenoceptor stimulation (fig. 10). in pertussis toxin-treated cardiomyocytes, [14c]phenylalanine
incorporation under ␤1-adrenoceptor stimulation was increased compared with that in nontreated cardiomyocytes. pertussis toxin alone had no effect on basal

was run for 25 cycles, and rt-pcr for ␤-actin was run for 18 cycles.

its effect on the  xxxd2401xxx -stimulated, camp-dependent increase in twitch amplitude of electrically
paced cardiomyocytes was analyzed. the control value
for the twitch amplitude was 4.12 ⫾ 1.44% of diastolic

second,  xxxg2198xxx  activation was inhibited by
genistein (100 ␮m). genistein attenuated the ␤1-adrenoceptor-mediated hypertrophic effect (fig. 9 and table 2). third, rapamycin (0.1 ␮m) was used to inhibit
activation of p70s6k. rapamycin completely abolished
the hypertrophic effect of ␤1-adrenoceptor stimulation

it is the main finding of the present study that
␤-adrenoceptor stimulation by  xxxd2401xxx  exerts a
hypertrophic effect of variable magnitude on mechanically quiescent ventricular cardiomyocytes isolated
from adult rat in copresence with equimolar concentrations of the ␤2-adrenoceptor antagonist ici-118551.
induction of  xxxg1626xxx  is causally involved in this hypertrophic response. in addition, this
hypertrophic response is genistein and rapamycin sensitive but camp independent. it is enhanced when
pertussis toxin-sensitive g proteins are inhibited.
this study provides the first evidence for hypertrophic responsiveness of ventricular cardiomyocytes
from adult rats to ␤-adrenoceptor stimulation. a direct

adult ventricular cardiomyocytes by ␤-adrenoceptor
stimulation has not been shown before. such effects on
cardiac growth have been shown previously in vivo (2,
5), in neonatal cardiomyocytes, where they were linked
to cell density and contraction (3, 14), or in adult
cardiomyocytes after precultivation and stimulation of
mechanical performance (7) or pretreatment with  xxxd2401xxx  (9). in newly isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes from adult animals, however, no direct effect of
nonspecific ␤-adrenoceptor stimulation was found. in
contrast to growth effects mediated by ␤-receptors, the
findings on growth effects of ␣-adrenoceptor stimulation are consistent. in all investigated models ␣-adrenoceptor stimulation promotes protein synthesis and

cell growth. in adult cardiomyocytes from rats this
effect is mediated through ␣1-adrenoceptors (4). in the
present study this hypertrophic effect to ␣1-adrenoceptor stimulation was used as a reference.
in contrast to previous experiments on the growthpromoting effects of ␤-adrenoceptor stimulation in cardiomyocytes, the experiments presented here were performed with  xxxd2401xxx  in the presence of an
equimolar dose of the selective ␤2-adrenoceptor antagonist ici-118551. the resulting hypertrophic response
was antagonized by the addition of either atenolol or
metoprolol, two chemically distinct ␤1-adrenoceptor

hypertrophic effect of ␤1-adrenoceptor stimulation

antagonists. nonspecific effects on ␣-receptors were
excluded by showing the inability of  xxxd3000xxx  to influence the hypertrophic effect of  xxxd2401xxx  plus ici118551. these data, together with the finding that the
␤2-adrenoceptor agonist  xxxd3017xxx  has no effect on its
own, indicate that the observed hypertrophic effect of
 xxxd2401xxx  plus ici-118551 is caused by a selective
␤1-adrenoceptor stimulation. this interpretation of our
data, however, is limited by the uncertainty regarding
side effects of these agents on putative ␤3- and ␤4adrenoceptors on cardiomyocytes. because the cardiomyocytes are quiescent in the model system, the effects
are independent of contractile performance. the hypertrophic effect includes an acceleration of protein synthesis, an increase in cellular protein and rna mass,
and enlargements of length, width, volume, and crosssectional area of the cells. comparison of the growthstimulating action of ␤1-adrenoceptor stimulation with
the inefficiency of nonselective ␤-adrenoceptor stimulation leads to the conclusion that nonselective ␤-adrenoceptor stimulation confers an inhibitory action on
the growth promotion by selective ␤1-adrenoceptor
stimulation. the fact that the ␤2-antagonist ici118551 is sufficient to unravel this growth promotion
indicates that ␤2-adrenoceptor stimulation exerts this
inhibitory action. this is confirmed by the observation
that  xxxd3017xxx  antagonizes the growth effect of norepinephrine plus  xxxd3000xxx . the mechanism of the inhibitory ␤2-mediated action was not investigated in this
study.
the sole presence of the ␤2-adrenoceptor agonist
 xxxd3017xxx  did not induce a growth effect on its own. we
showed previously that on exposure to transforming
growth factor-␤ (tgf-␤), adult cardiomyocytes in culture can develop a specific hypertrophic responsiveness
to ␤2-adrenoceptor stimulation (23, 28). in these tgf␤-treated cultures, cardiomyocytes no longer exhibit a
growth response to ␤1-adrenoceptor stimulation, and
␤2-adrenoceptor stimulation no longer inhibits this response. under the influence of tgf-␤, the hypertrophic
responsiveness of cardiomyocytes to ␤-adrenoceptor
stimulation therefore changes markedly.
in vivo, effects of ␤-adrenoceptor stimulation on
myocardial hypertrophy have been shown to be accompanied by induction of odc (2). odc represents the
rate-limiting enzyme of the polyamine metabolism. elevated tissue contents of polyamines are found in hypertrophic hearts on ␤-adrenoceptor stimulation (8).
polyamines are able to stabilize nucleic acids such as
rna, because of their cationic character, and prolong
their half-life. this may explain the mechanism by
which odc induces the elevation of the cellular rna
mass. in the present study we found that selective
␤1-adrenoceptor stimulation causes induction of odc
in vitro. inhibition of odc by  xxxd1972xxx  inhibited the
hypertrophic response to ␤1-adrenoceptor stimulation,
i.e., it attenuated the increase in total rna mass,
protein synthesis, and protein mass. these results
demonstrate a supportive role for odc in the hypertrophic response to ␤1-adrenoceptor stimulation.

the ␤1-adrenoceptor-mediated hypertrophic effect
identified in the present study is genistein sensitive,
indicating that this ␤1-adrenoceptor-mediated signaling pathway may include an activation of tyrosine
kinases. a genistein-sensitive signaling pathway under ␤1-adrenoceptor stimulation was recently also
found for the activation of kcl channels (26). the kind
of genistein-sensitive kinases involved here have yet to
be identified. the ␤1-adrenoceptor-mediated hypertrophic effect on newly isolated cardiomyocytes is camp
independent, in agreement with our previous observations that dibutyryl-camp does not increase protein
synthesis in newly isolated cardiomyocytes from adult
rats (21) and the results that bogoyevitch and colleagues (4) found with isolated perfused rat hearts. the
hypertrophic effect is not sensitive to  xxxd3536xxx , a pi
3-kinase inhibitor. pi 3-kinase activation is part of the
intracellular signaling pathway leading to myocardial
hypertrophic growth caused by other growth promoters, e.g., ␣-adrenoceptor stimulation (12, 20).
we also found that the hypertrophic response to
selective ␤1-adrenoceptor stimulation is sensitive to
pertussis toxin. the presence of pertussis toxin enlarged the stimulation of protein synthesis. others
observed before that pertussis toxin can increase the
sensitivity of ␤1-adrenoceptors in adult cardiomyocytes
from the guinea pig (13). this could be explained by a
competition between tonically active g␣i (pertussis
toxin sensitive) and g␣s (pertussis toxin insensitive)
for adenylate cyclase. because the hypertrophic response to selective ␤1-adrenoceptor stimulation described here is camp independent, another explanation must be sought. it is, at present, unclear how
␤1-adrenoceptors couple to tyrosine kinases (as discussed above). the data for pertussis toxin may suggest that pertussis toxin-sensitive proteins tonically
inhibit this coupling.
the results of the present study demonstrate that
␤-adrenoceptor stimulation can induce hypertrophy of
ventricular cardiomyocytes from adult rats if ␤1-adrenoceptors are preferentially activated. one pathomechanism by which this can occur in vivo has been
described. in patients with heart failure, autoantibodies are frequently found in plasma that confer an
intrinsic activity directed selectively against the ␤1adrenoceptors (25).
in summary, our study describes a camp-independent hypertrophic effect of selective ␤1-adrenoceptor
stimulation on adult cardiomyocytes that requires an
activation of the polyamine metabolism as indicated by
its dependency on odc induction.
this study was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft grants schl 324/3-1 and pi 162/11-2.
