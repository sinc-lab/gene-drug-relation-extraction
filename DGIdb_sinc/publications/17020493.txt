t cells are central mediators of adaptive immunity. as such, they
are involved in both normal immune responses (e.g., rejection of
a transplanted organ) and abnormal ones (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). t cells require both antigen-speciﬁc and costimulatory signals
for their full activation. advances in protein engineering and an increased understanding of the immune response have culminated in
the evolution and creation of protein therapeutics that target speciﬁc costimulatory molecules. the selective costimulation modulator  xxxd52xxx  (ctla- xxxd961xxx ) binds to  xxxg396xxx  and  xxxg398xxx , blocking
interaction with cd28, and is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis.  xxxd296xxx , currently enrolling
phase iii trials in renal transplantation, was rationally designed from
 xxxd52xxx  to bind with more avidity to  xxxg398xxx , providing the more
potent immunosuppressive properties required for immunosuppression in transplantation. this review describes the relevant immunology and summarizes recent clinical ﬁndings on these two molecules.
although both inhibit the cd28 costimulatory pathway, they are tailored for speciﬁc disease states— xxxd52xxx  for autoimmune diseases
and  xxxd296xxx  for transplantation.

t cells are key mediators of acquired or
adaptive immunity, playing a crucial role in
both appropriate and aberrant immune responses. insights into the immunologic pathways involving antigen presentation and t
cell responses have provided novel targets
for therapeutic intervention. advances in
protein engineering have now enabled the
creation of tailored therapeutics, maximizing
target speciﬁcity while, it is hoped, minimizing unwanted collateral toxicities. these two
achievements have led to the creation of fusion proteins designed to interrupt these critical t cell activation pathways. this review
describes the clinical development of two related protein therapeutics that bind to  xxxg396xxx 
and  xxxg398xxx , blocking activation of t cell costimulation through cd28.  xxxd52xxx  [cytotoxic t-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 immunoglobulin (ctla- xxxd961xxx )] is approved for
the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (ra), and
 xxxd296xxx  ( xxxd296xxx ), a second-generation
 xxxg544xxx -ig, is currently in phase iii trials in
renal transplantation.

costimulatory pathways
and their effects
t cells, or t lymphocytes, play a central role
in the initiation and regulation of the adaptive
immune response to antigen, whether foreign
or native. naive t cells require more than
one signal for their full activation (1). the
ﬁrst, signal 1, is an antigen-speciﬁc signal provided by the t cell receptor interacting with
the major histocompatibility complex (mhc)
and antigenic peptide complex on the antigenpresenting cell (apc). the second, or costimulatory signal, is provided by the interactions
between speciﬁc receptors on the t cell and
their ligands on the apc.
following these two signals, a number
of pathways are activated. they include
the calcium–calcineurin pathway, the ras–
mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway,
and the nuclear factor-kappab ( xxxg1559xxx ) pathway

with subsequent transcription of a number of
effector compounds, including the cytokine
interleukin (il)-2. il-2 activates the target
of rapamycin (tor) pathway, sometimes referred to as signal 3. this induces t cell proliferation, generation of an effector, cd4+ t
cell pool [t helper (th )] and the clonal expansion of activated cd8+ or cytotoxic t cells (2).
in the absence of a second signal, a state of t
cell unresponsiveness (anergy) can result, rendering the t cell unable to respond further.
multiple costimulatory pathways are involved in t cell regulation; these can either
upregulate or downregulate t cell activation
(3). perhaps the most critical, and certainly
the best-characterized, costimulatory interactions are between cd40 and  xxxg390xxx  of the
 xxxg2296xxx  (tnf):tnf receptor
(tnfr) family and between cd28 and  xxxg396xxx 
and  xxxg398xxx  in the b7 family (3).1 the cd40–
 xxxg390xxx  pathway was initially described as critical for b cell activation and differentiation,
but it was subsequently reported to contribute
to t cell activation by upregulating the b7family ligands  xxxg396xxx  and  xxxg398xxx  on apcs.
 xxxg390xxx  is expressed on vascular endothelial
cells, smooth muscle cells, and macrophages,
suggesting an expanded role for the cd40–
 xxxg390xxx  pathway during immunity (4).
prevention of acute rejection and even operational tolerance have been demonstrated
using anti- xxxg390xxx  in nonhuman primate
models of kidney transplantation (5). unfortunately, initial studies in humans demonstrated unacceptable thromboembolic complications, possibly owing to the expression
of  xxxg390xxx  on platelets and its ability to stabilize arterial thrombi (6). although inhibition
of the cd40– xxxg390xxx  pathway is still being investigated (predominantly through targeting
cd40), blockade of the cd28 costimulatory
pathway is emerging as a leading therapeutic
strategy for selectively modulating full t cell
activation.

 xxxg390xxx  is also known as  xxxg390xxx  ( xxxg390xxx ).  xxxg396xxx  is
also known as  xxxg396xxx , and  xxxg398xxx  as  xxxg398xxx .

the cd28 pathway
cd28 interaction with its ligands,  xxxg396xxx  and
 xxxg398xxx  (3), is essential for initiating antigenspeciﬁc t cell responses. cd28 is expressed
constitutively on the surface of ∼80% of human t cells (7). levels of cd28 increase on t
cells following activation, and the subsequent
engagement of cd28 with  xxxg396xxx  and  xxxg398xxx 
enhances proliferation, increases cell survival
due to expression of antiapoptotic molecules,
prepares the cellular bioenergetic machinery
for the metabolic demands of the clonal expansion process, and markedly increases cytokine secretion (8).
cd28 signals promote t cell differentiation into th (th 1-phenotype) cells and enhance both the production of antibodies by b
cells and the proliferation of previously activated t cells (9). the two ligands for cd28,
 xxxg396xxx  and  xxxg398xxx , have distinct but overlapping functions.  xxxg398xxx  is constitutively expressed and is rapidly upregulated on apcs
coincident with signal 1, whereas  xxxg396xxx  expression levels are very low on the resting cell;
higher expression is usually induced following more prolonged t cell stimulation (8, 10).
these differences suggest distinct roles for the
two ligands.  xxxg398xxx  may be important in mediating initial t cell activation, and  xxxg396xxx  may
play a greater part in perpetuating the immune
response (figure 1a).
both  xxxg396xxx  and  xxxg398xxx  bind to a second receptor on the t cell, cytotoxic t lymphocyte–
associated antigen-4 (ctla-4), which shares
∼30% homology with cd28 (11).  xxxg544xxx  is a higher-avidity receptor for  xxxg396xxx  and
 xxxg398xxx  than cd28, binding ∼500–2500-fold
more avidly to  xxxg396xxx  and  xxxg398xxx  (12–14). it
is induced 24–48 h after t cell activation
and inhibits t cell activation in both naive
and primed cd4+ and cd8+ t cells (15).
this results in an attenuation of il-2 and
il-2-receptor ( xxxg1175xxx ) expression and arrest
of t cells at the g1 phase of the cell cycle
(figure 1b) (9).
recent studies suggest that, in some
circumstances,  xxxg398xxx  binds preferentially

to cd28, whereas  xxxg396xxx  primarily ligates
ctla-4 (16). these differences in afﬁnity
and avidity translate into a difference in the
selective recruitment of cd28 or ctla-4 to
the immunologic synapse. this distinction in
binding preference is important when considering therapeutic intervention for the prevention of allograft rejection ( xxxg398xxx -mediated
initial activation) or for reducing inﬂammation in autoimmune diseases, such as ra
( xxxg396xxx -mediated perpetuation).

development of
 xxxd52xxx  and  xxxd296xxx 
the dimeric fusion protein  xxxd52xxx 
(ctla- xxxd961xxx ) consists of the extracellular
binding domain of ctla-4 linked to a
modiﬁed fc domain (hinge, ch2, and
ch3 regions) of human immunoglobulin
g1 (igg1).  xxxd52xxx  was developed to
block the interactions of cd28 with  xxxg396xxx 
and  xxxg398xxx .  xxxd52xxx  binds more avidly
than cd28 to  xxxg396xxx / xxxg398xxx , as does native
ctla-4. the addition of the igg1 domain
solubilizes the ctla-4 domain, creating a
soluble receptor for  xxxg396xxx / xxxg398xxx  without
the intracellular negative signaling of the
native, membrane-bound protein. numerous
studies have shown that  xxxd52xxx  and other
ctla- xxxd961xxx  molecules act to inhibit immune
responses, both in vitro and in vivo. the in
vitro binding of ctla- xxxd961xxx  to  xxxg396xxx  and
 xxxg398xxx  downregulates t cell proliferation
and inhibits humoral immune responses
(17).
therapeutic inhibition of the cd28 pathway using ctla- xxxd961xxx  was ﬁrst established in
the transplantation setting, where graft survival was effectively prolonged and, in many
cases, donor-speciﬁc tolerance was induced
(18, 19). unfortunately, these effects in rodent
models of transplantation failed to translate
into utility in nonhuman primate organ transplantation studies (20). however, ctla- xxxd961xxx 
slowed disease progression in several animal
models of autoimmune disease (21, 22).

for this reason, a rational design concept
was used to improve the binding characteristics of  xxxg544xxx -ig to  xxxg398xxx  speciﬁcally, owing
to the presumed importance of  xxxg398xxx  in the
initiation of the immune reaction in primates
and possibly in humans. this process resulted
in  xxxd296xxx , a second-generation  xxxd52xxx , which demonstrated superior binding to
 xxxg396xxx  and  xxxg398xxx  compared with ctla- xxxd961xxx 
and provided the more potent immunosuppressive properties required for transplantation.  xxxd52xxx , the parent molecule, was developed clinically for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and has recently been approved
by the u.s. food and drug administration
for the treatment of moderate to severe ra.
the design of both  xxxd52xxx  and  xxxd296xxx 
and their clinical results in both conditions are
described below.

rheumatoid arthritis
immune response
ra is a systemic, progressive, autoimmune,
inﬂammatory polyarthritis, affecting ∼1% of
the population worldwide (23). evolving concepts in understanding the immunopathology
of ra have proposed that genetic and environmental factors underpin a complex series
of molecular and cellular interactions, culminating in a chronic inﬂammatory response.
in ra, the synovium expands into a vascular,
invasive mass of inﬂammatory tissue, termed
pannus. within this tissue, immune cells are
abnormally abundant and up to 50% are activated t cells (24–26).
in the rheumatoid synovium, antigenactivated cd4+ t cells stimulate monocytes, macrophages, and synovial ﬁbroblasts
to secrete the cytokines il-1, il-6, and
tnf-alpha as well as matrix metalloproteinases
(involved in joint and bone destruction).
these t cells also stimulate b cells to produce antibodies, such as rheumatoid factor
(figure 2).

current treatment paradigm in
rheumatoid arthritis
current treatment options for ra are
multifocal and include nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs, corticosteroids, and
the so-called disease-modifying antiinﬂammatory drugs (dmards), such as
 xxxd2301xxx ,
 xxxd3255xxx ,
and
methotrexate (mtx). mtx is the mainstay
of ra treatment (27). recently, protein
therapeutics, or biologic dmards, which
speciﬁcally target key inﬂammatory cytokines, have been introduced into the
treatment paradigm. of these, three inhibit
tnf-alpha (adalimumab, inﬂiximab, and etanercept) and the fourth inhibits il-1 (anakinra).
anticytokine therapies have demonstrated
efﬁcacy in many ra patients, reducing signs
and symptoms, inhibiting the progression
of structural damage, and improving healthrelated quality of life (hrqol) (28, 29).
common side effects of tnf-alpha inhibitors are
mild and rarely result in discontinuation of
treatment. however, a low incidence of more
serious side effects has emerged during postmarketing surveillance, namely opportunistic
infections and reactivation of latent tuberculosis (30). furthermore, 20%–40% of patients
who receive anti-tnf therapies have no clinical response as measured by the american
college of rheumatology criteria, and some
patients may lose their response over time
(31).

costimulation modulation
the efﬁcacy of  xxxd52xxx  in treating human
autoimmune diseases was ﬁrst demonstrated
in patients with psoriasis vulgaris, where a
beneﬁcial effect was demonstrated on psoriatic lesions (32). phase ii and iii trials of
 xxxd52xxx  plus mtx in ra patients with an
inadequate response to mtx demonstrated
statistically signiﬁcant and clinically meaningful improvements in the signs and symptoms

of ra compared with mtx alone (33–35), as
early as day 15 following the ﬁrst  xxxd52xxx  infusion (35). statistically signiﬁcant and clinically meaningful improvements were also seen
in physical function and both the mental and
physical aspects of hrqol. these beneﬁts
were sustained and, in some cases, augmented
in patients who continued through three years
of open-label treatment during a long-term
extension of the phase ii trial (36).  xxxd52xxx 
also slowed the progression of structural damage at one year compared with mtx (37).
serum levels of inﬂammatory mediators, such
as il-2, tnf-alpha, and interferon-gamma, were reduced, suggesting that activated t cells have a
central role in ra immunopathogenesis (38).
as with the anti-tnf agents, not all patients responded to  xxxd52xxx , although the
proportion of responders was similar to that
seen in studies of anti-tnfs. however,  xxxd52xxx  is the ﬁrst agent to be studied and approved for the treatment of patients with an
inadequate response to treatment with  xxxg2296xxx  antagonists, as part of the phase iii attain ( xxxd52xxx  trial in treatment of antitnf inadequate responders) study (39). in
these patients,  xxxd52xxx  demonstrated statistically signiﬁcant and clinically meaningful
improvements in signs and symptoms, and improvements in physical function and hrqol.
when data from ﬁve clinical trials of  xxxd52xxx 
in 2000 ra patients were integrated,  xxxd52xxx  was found to be well tolerated, with a consistent safety proﬁle (40). across the doubleblind periods of ﬁve clinical trials, the rates
of adverse events and serious adverse events
were slightly higher between the  xxxd52xxx 
and placebo treatment groups (41).
a few patients received  xxxd52xxx  with
concomitant anti-tnf therapy. these patients experienced a higher incidence of serious infections [9/205 (4.4%)] than did patients treated with anticytokine therapy alone
[2/136 (1.5%)] (41). the combination of biologic agents at the doses employed did not
appear to improve outcome signiﬁcantly at

6 months. although the number of patients
in this group was small, combination treatment is not recommended. the early preclinical promise of  xxxd52xxx  (ctla- xxxd961xxx ) appears
to have been realized in patients with moderate to severe ra, including those patients with
an inadequate response to mtx or anti-tnf
therapy.

solid-organ
transplantation
overview
since the ﬁrst successful renal transplant in
1954, solid-organ transplantation has become
the preferred therapy for a variety of end-stage
organ diseases. however, demand for organs
still dramatically outstrips supply. the 28,000
patients who received solid organ transplants
in the united states in 2005 comprise less than
a third of the patients currently awaiting transplantation (42).
recipients of solid-organ transplants generally require lifelong immunosuppression in
order to maintain a state of low- or nonimmunoresponsiveness to the allograft. unfortunately, advances in the regimens and therapies used to prevent acute, or early, rejection
have not been matched by similar improvements in long-term patient or graft survival
(see review by tantravahi et al., “why hasn’t
eliminating acute rejection improved graft
survival?”, in this volume). paradoxically, the
long-term survival of both the allografts and
the recipients are affected by nonimmune toxicities caused, in part, by the immunosuppressive therapies used to prevent graft rejection. current immunosuppressive regimens
are associated with increased risks of diabetes
mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and malignancies. perhaps most critically, calcineurin
inhibitors (cnis), currently the cornerstone
therapy for chronic maintenance of immunosuppression, are almost invariably associated with nephrotoxicity, resulting in a high

the immune response to transplantation of
an allograft is primarily mediated through
t cell–dependent mechanisms, including cytokine expression (il-2, il-15), t cell proliferation, and clonal expansion, as well as
some forms of antibody-mediated rejection
that require t cell interaction for initiation
(figure 3).
the cascade of events that lead to organ
rejection presents a number of targets for inhibiting t cells, t cell activation, and the subsequent effects of activated t cells. current
immunosuppressive strategies inhibit t cell
effects by depleting t cells, inhibiting t cell
response pathways, or interrupting the trafﬁcking of t cells into allografts/injured tissue
(figure 4).
regimens generally utilize more potent immunosuppression in the early posttransplant or induction phase, when immune
responses to the allograft are at their highest.
induction agents include protein therapeutics (either polyclonal antibodies or murine,
chimeric, or humanized monoclonal antibodies), which act mainly by depleting lymphocytes or suppressing proliferation and blunting the effects of t cell activation. protein
therapeutics target speciﬁc cell-surface glycoproteins or membrane-bound receptors and
fall into two broad categories: depleting and
nondepleting agents.
depleting agents are used to reduce early
rejection. they are associated with cytokine
release syndrome, as well as the immunologic consequences of prolonged t cell depletion, such as infectious complications and
post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease.
 xxxd1798xxx  and  xxxd286xxx  are nondepleting monoclonal antibodies. these agents
speciﬁcally target the  xxxg1175xxx , inhibiting the
signal for proliferation resulting from initial

t cell activation. unlike the t cell–depleting
agents, these compounds are associated with
a low incidence of toxicities and side effects
(44). however, despite their speciﬁcity, currently approved protein therapeutics are generally inappropriate for long-term use. the
depleting agents act too broadly, compromising safety; the anti- xxxg1175xxx  antibodies act too
narrowly (targeting only one aspect of t cell
activation) to effectively block rejection when
used alone.
following the induction phase, transplant
patients transition to what is known as the
maintenance phase of immunosuppressive
treatment. effective maintenance immunosuppression is the key to preventing rejection
throughout the life of the graft. maintenance immunosuppressive strategies typically
include the so-called cornerstone therapies,
cnis, along with antiproliferative agents
[ xxxd2677xxx  (mmf) or sirolimus]
and steroids.
cnis interfere with the transduction of
signal 1 and the activation of the  xxxg1559xxx  pathway, inhibiting the transcription that generates cytokines, such as il-2. the targets of
cnis and steroids are ubiquitously expressed
and their subsequent nonspeciﬁc, nonimmune effects can compromise the ability to
achieve optimal long-term outcomes in organ
transplantation.
agents that inhibit lymphocyte proliferation, such as mmf and the mammalian
tor inhibitors (sirolimus and  xxxd2072xxx ),
target intracellular signaling pathways. these
antiproliferatives are often used as adjuncts
to the cornerstone immunosuppressants and
may enable use of lower doses of cnis or
steroids, minimizing their nonimmune toxicities. despite this, the drugs in antiproliferative and cni regimens necessitate frequent
therapeutic drug monitoring and dosage adjustment in order to remain within the narrow
therapeutic windows of current immunosuppressive agents.
these limitations have motivated a search
for novel agents/regimens with greater selectivity and improved toxicity proﬁles. recently,

as with autoimmune diseases, the focus of research has turned toward costimulation blockade. the limited distribution of the targets
of this type of therapy should avoid the nonimmune toxicities associated with currently
available therapies.

costimulation blockade
preclinical studies demonstrated ctla-4igmediated inhibition of t cell–dependent antibody responses and prolongation of transplanted organ survival. however, ctla- xxxd961xxx 
was found to be inadequate to maintain a
hyporesponsive state to an allograft in some
models (20, 45, 46). it has been demonstrated
that  xxxg396xxx  and  xxxg398xxx  may differentially control the immune response owing to the distinct properties of each molecule (47). the
more rapid dissociation of ctla- xxxd961xxx  from
 xxxg398xxx  than from  xxxg396xxx  may have resulted in
less effective inhibition of  xxxg398xxx -dependent
responses than of  xxxg396xxx -dependent responses
(13). in addition, anti- xxxg398xxx  antibodies, but
not anti- xxxg396xxx  antibodies, prevented the rejection of allogeneic islet transplants; although the combination of both antibodies
was best able to prolong allograft survival
(48). therefore, it was hypothesized that a
compound that bound to  xxxg398xxx  with higher
avidity than ctla- xxxd961xxx  would provide the
inhibition of t cell costimulation necessary
to prevent allograft rejection. this hypothesis led to the development of  xxxd296xxx 
( xxxd296xxx ), a modiﬁed version of  xxxd52xxx ,
which was rationally designed to provide the
 xxxg398xxx -binding properties required for immunosuppression in transplantation.
a mutagenesis and screening strategy was
performed at the site of interaction between
cd28 and ctla-4 and  xxxg396xxx  and  xxxg398xxx .
two thousand three hundred mutants of  xxxd52xxx  were screened and assessed for increased
binding to  xxxg398xxx . a mutant molecule was
identiﬁed with a substitution of glutamate for
leucine at position 104 (l104e) and a further
substitution of alanine to tyrosine at position
29, hence  xxxd296xxx , subsequently named be-

latacept.  xxxd296xxx  demonstrated a fourfold
slower off-rate for  xxxg398xxx  and a twofold slower
off-rate for  xxxg396xxx  compared with  xxxd52xxx .
furthermore, it was tenfold more potent than
 xxxd52xxx  at inhibiting t cell proliferation in
a mixed lymphocyte reaction (20).
nonhuman primate studies using  xxxd296xxx  demonstrated efﬁcacy in preventing
acute rejection compared with  xxxd52xxx .
when combined with drugs typically
used in human transplant immunosuppressive regimens— xxxd286xxx  (an anti
 xxxg1175xxx  antibody), steroids, and mmf (an
antiproliferative)—renal allograft function
was signiﬁcantly prolonged (49).  xxxd296xxx 
also inhibited the formation of antidonor
antibodies, thought to contribute to the
development of chronic rejection and a major
barrier to retransplantation.

 xxxd296xxx  in clinical trials
for renal transplantation
the ﬁndings in nonhuman primate renal
transplantation were used to design a phase
ii multicenter clinical study comparing the
safety and efﬁcacy of  xxxd296xxx  versus cyclosporine, a cni (50). de novo renal transplant recipients received either a more- or
less-intensive  xxxd296xxx  dosing regimen or
cyclosporine. all patients received  xxxd286xxx  induction, mmf, and corticosteroids. at
six months, there was no signiﬁcant difference in the incidence of clinically suspected,
biopsy-proven acute rejection between the
three treatment groups, despite the complete
avoidance of cnis in the  xxxd296xxx  arms. the
observed acute rejection rates are similar to
those observed in previous studies using cyclosporine and are well below those reported
in studies using  xxxd286xxx  induction, mmf,
and steroids without cni treatment.
importantly, renal function at 12 months,
shown to be the most important predictor
of the long-term survival of renal allografts
(51), was signiﬁcantly better preserved in patients receiving  xxxd296xxx  than in those receiving cyclosporine, possibly because of the

avoidance of cnis. furthermore, belatacepttreated patients demonstrated lower rates
of tubular atrophy and interstitial ﬁbrosis
[also known as chronic allograft nephropathy
(can)] upon histologic examination. can
is almost universally present 10 years posttransplant in patients treated with cnis (52).
around 50%–80% of renal transplant recipients who return to dialysis beyond two years
do so because of progressive can (53), and it
has been estimated that 50% of patients who
develop can will lose graft function within
ﬁve years of transplantation. therefore, the
renal function beneﬁts seen with  xxxd296xxx , if
borne out in the long term and in future studies with higher patient numbers, are likely to
prove extremely signiﬁcant.
in this study, rates of cardiovascular and
metabolic comorbidities, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and post-transplant diabetes, were lower in the  xxxd296xxx  arm than
in the cyclosporine arm despite higher rates of
antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medication in the cyclosporine control regimen. like
the improved preservation of renal function,
this ﬁnding is probably related to the more
immunospeciﬁc mechanism of action of  xxxd296xxx  compared with cyclosporine. however,
as with can, these were secondary endpoints
and were not statistically signiﬁcantly different from the control arm at this time point
and with these relatively low patient numbers.
again, longer-term follow-up and additional
studies using higher patient numbers will determine the signiﬁcance of these ﬁndings.
discontinuations and adverse effects, including infections and malignancies, were similar between the  xxxd296xxx  and cyclosporine
groups, as were rates of graft loss and death

“extended-criteria donors” (see appendix for
deﬁnition). the latter recipients have a particularly high unmet need due to the increased
susceptibility of these organs to the nephrotoxic effects of cnis (54). both  xxxd296xxx 
phase iii clinical trials are utilizing several
primary endpoints to show noninferiority to
cyclosporine with respect to acute rejection
as well as to assess  xxxd296xxx ’s effect on the
preservation of renal function. the results of
these phase iii studies and trials in additional
organs are eagerly anticipated.

summary
targeting costimulation as a rational therapeutic strategy has proceeded in a logical,
stepwise fashion from animal models to human clinical trials to use in clinical practice.
preclinical studies highlighted the inhibition of the cd28 costimulatory pathway using  xxxd52xxx /ctla- xxxd961xxx  as a rational strategy that selectively targeted t cell activation
and was effective in models of autoimmune
diseases and transplantation. studies in humans and nonhuman primates demonstrated
the different requirements for modulating the
aberrant immune response in autoimmune
disease and blocking the normal immune response to an allograft. these ﬁndings led to
the parallel developments of  xxxd52xxx , as a biologic dmard for the treatment of ra, and
 xxxd296xxx , for maintenance immunosuppression following transplantation.
 xxxd52xxx , a selective costimulation modulator, has been approved in the united states
for the treatment of moderate to severe ra.
studies of  xxxd52xxx  for the potential treatment of other autoimmune diseases are being initiated, based on preclinical evidence
and the scientiﬁc rationale identifying the activated t cell as central to these disease states.
 xxxd296xxx , a selective costimulation blocker,
was rationally designed by substituting two
amino acids in the  xxxd52xxx   xxxg396xxx /cd86binding domain, which increased binding
avidity to  xxxg398xxx , thereby providing the potency required for immunosuppression in

transplantation. organ transplantation seems
poised to gain many beneﬁts from this novel
approach because improving long-term outcomes, particularly with respect to preserving renal function, is the goal of transplantation. innovative technology has allowed
these therapies to travel from bench to bedside, providing broad utility in a number of
areas.

summary points
1. advances in protein engineering have enabled the creation of therapies targeting
t cell costimulation to be tailored to speciﬁc conditions.
2. the selective costimulation modulator  xxxd52xxx  is approved for the treatment of
moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis.
3. its sister compound,  xxxd296xxx , has demonstrated efﬁcacy in the prevention of rejection following renal transplantation.

future issues
1. longer-term data on  xxxd52xxx  in rheumatoid arthritis patients and  xxxd296xxx  in renal
transplant recipients are awaited.
2.  xxxd52xxx  is being studied in a variety of other autoimmune diseases.
3. phase iii studies of  xxxd296xxx , including those using organs from extended-criteria
donors, are ongoing.
