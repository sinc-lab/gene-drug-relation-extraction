evidence that  xxxd2041xxx  binds  xxxg1359xxx  to inhibit type iv collagenase secretion.   xxxd2041xxx  is a novel anti-microtubule drug shown to bind map-1 and  xxxg1360xxx  (microtubule-associated proteins) in vitro. in this paper we have shown that  xxxd2041xxx  specifically binds  xxxg1359xxx  in du 145a cells, resulting in disruption of  xxxg1359xxx  microtubules and inhibition of type iv collagenase secretion. immunofluorescence studies revealed that at 30 microm levels  xxxd2041xxx  blocked type iv collagenase secretion by partial disruption of the  xxxg1359xxx  microtubule networks. immunoprecipitation studies with polyclonal antibodies provided quantitative evidence that 30-60 microm  xxxd2041xxx  blocked secretion of a 105 x 10(3) mr type iv collagenase. pulse-labeling experiments confirmed that the effect was not a result of inhibition of either protein synthesis or altered rates of type iv collagenase turnover. finally, drug uptake studies with [3h] xxxd2041xxx , scintillation counting and fluorography demonstrated that the principal target of the drug was  xxxg1359xxx . for the first time we have shown that the drug blocks secretion by binding  xxxg1359xxx  and causing incomplete disruption of the microtubule networks.
