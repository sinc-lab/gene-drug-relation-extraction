enhancing enhancers: new complexities in the retinoid regulation of gene expression.   xxxd3417xxx  is a signalling molecule central to morphogenesis and musculoskeletal development. it can exist in several isomeric forms, of which all-trans- and 9- xxxd2404xxx  are thought to be the most relevant as signalling molecules.  xxxd3417xxx  regulates gene expression via rars ( xxxd3417xxx  receptors) working as heterodimers with rxrs (retinoid x receptors). rxrs also heterodimerize with other nuclear receptors. in this issue of the biochemical journal, harris et al. have shown that an enhancer responsible for chondrocyte-specific expression of the col11a2 gene is itself regulated by a retinoic-acid-dependent interaction with rxrbeta bound to a downstream response element. thus, rxrs bound to hormone-response elements can regulate gene expression indirectly via interactions with tissue-specific enhancers. this study raises interesting questions about the nature of the response element, the rxrbeta partner and the ligands able to influence col11a2 expression, and will provide a model system with which to understand tissue and ligand specificity of retinoid responses.
