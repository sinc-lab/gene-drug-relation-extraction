human  xxxg2109xxx  ( xxxg2109xxx ) is located at the apical membrane of proximal tubule cells and involved in renal
secretion and reabsorption of endogenous substances as well as many drugs and xenobiotics. this study reevaluated the
physiologic role, transport mode, and driving forces of  xxxg2109xxx . 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-cf) uptake into hek293 cells that
stably expressed  xxxg2109xxx  was saturable, resulting in a km of 108 ␮m. 6-cf as well as [3h] xxxd2046xxx  ([3h]es) accumulation
by hek293- xxxg2109xxx  cells were abolished by es, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate,  xxxd3256xxx , benzbromarone, and probenecid, whereas several oa, including p-aminohippurate (pah), lactate, pyrazinoate, nicotinate, glutarate, and the diuretic
hydrochlorothiazide ( xxxd2294xxx ) exhibited a slight or a ns inhibitory effect. pah and glutarate are not taken up by hek293hoat4 cells, but they trans-stimulated 6-cf and [3h]es uptake, indicating an asymmetric interaction of  xxxg2109xxx  with these
substrates. in chloride-free medium, hek293- xxxg2109xxx  –mediated [3h]pah efflux was almost abolished, whereas addition of es
restored it comparable to ringer solution, consistent with a physiologic es/pah or pah/clⴚ exchange mode of  xxxg2109xxx .
moreover, an acidification of the uptake medium increased 6-cf as well as [3h]es uptake, which was reduced by nigericin,
suggesting that  xxxg2109xxx  also can operate as an oa/ohⴚ exchanger.  xxxg2109xxx  facilitates substantial uptake of [14c]urate, which
was elevated 2.6-fold by intracellular  xxxd2294xxx . thus,  xxxg2109xxx  is the long-postulated, low-affinity apical urate anion exchanger
that facilitates  xxxd2294xxx -associated hyperuricemia.

a

ctive tubular transport processes determine secretion
or reabsorption of a large variety of substances, a
substantial fraction of which is represented by organic anions (oa), such as antibiotics, diuretics, antiviral
drugs, cytostatics, and several endogenous metabolites. proteins that are known to deal with these multiple compounds
belong to the family of organic anion transporters (oat) (1–3).
they are expressed along the proximal tubule of the kidneys
and in other bordering epithelia as such blood-brain barrier,
choroid plexus, and placenta.  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  are located at
the basolateral membrane of renal proximal tubule cells. both
transporters show overlapping substrate specificities and share
the mode of transport and driving force, exchanging oa
against ␣-ketoglutarate (4), representing the first step of renal
oa secretion. the luminal exit of oa is not well characterized.
besides  xxxg2114xxx  (luminal localization in rodents [5]), the voltagedependent oatv1 (related to npt1 in human [6,7]), and the
multidrug resistance–associated proteins 2 and 4 (8), other oat
members, namely  xxxg2109xxx , oat5, and urat1, have been doc-

umented to be involved in apical oa release as well as in
reabsorption processes (9 –12).
hurat1 was discovered recently as apical urate transporter,
playing a pivotal role in urate homeostasis (11,13,14). mutations in
the hurat1 gene diminish renal urate reabsorption, resulting in
hypouricemia (11). hurat1 operates as an exchanger, which
takes up urate from the primary urine in exchange for intracellular
nicotinate or lactate but not ␣-ketoglutarate, indicating different
driving forces for oat at the luminal and basolateral side of
proximal tubule cells. accordingly, the apically expressed roat5
exchanges organic anions against succinate, a dicarboxylate that is
not accepted by  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  (10).
 xxxg2109xxx  was identified as apical transporter in the proximal
tubule cells (15), which is expressed only in higher primates,
including human. it facilitates the reabsorption of conjugated
steroids such as  xxxd2046xxx  (es) or dehydroepiandrosterone
sulfate with high affinity (12). moreover,  xxxg2109xxx  was detected
in placenta, where it may be involved in the uptake of fetalderived steroid sulfates (16). the driving force of  xxxg2109xxx -mediated transport is controversial, and its physiologic role is still
unknown.  xxxg2109xxx  is closely related to hurat1, and their genes
are located as a tandem on chromosome 11q13 (17). recently,
eraly et al. (17) postulated that oat, which are genomically
clustered in pairs, should have similar functional characteristics. this assumption holds for  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx , but published
functional data of  xxxg2109xxx  and urat1 so far do not support this
hypothesis (11,12).

we re-investigated the transport mechanism and substrate
specificity of  xxxg2109xxx . we describe for the first time that  xxxg2109xxx 
transports urate. urate/hydrochlorothiazide ( xxxd2294xxx ) or urate/
oh⫺ exchange by  xxxg2109xxx  may be involved in  xxxd2294xxx -associated
hyperuricemia (18). in addition, we provide evidence that
 xxxg2109xxx  operates in an asymmetric manner and interacts with
inorganic anions such as chloride and hydroxyl ions. furthermore, our data prove that  xxxg2109xxx  facilitates one-way p-aminohippurate (pah; and probably drug) excretion into the urine and
that it may represent the formerly postulated low-affinity urate/
oh⫺ exchanger in the human brush border membrane (19).

materials and methods
reagents
materials used included fbs, trypsin, and pbs (invitrogen, groningen, the netherlands). all chemicals were of analytic grade and
purchased from sigma-aldrich (deisenhofen, germany). 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-cf) was purchased from molecular probes (leiden, the
netherlands). [3h]es (es, ammonium salt, [6,7-3h(n)], 43.5 ci/mmol)
was purchased from new england nuclear (boston, ma). [14c]uric
acid (arc-513, [8-14c], 50 to 60 mci/mmol) was obtained from
biotrend (cologne, germany). [3h]pah (3.25 ci/mmol) was provided
by perkin elmer life sciences (boston, ma). [14c]glutarate (ga), (glutaric acid, [1,5-14c], 30.8 mci/mmol) was obtained from icn (costa
mesa, ca).

300 ␮m cold  xxxd3472xxx )  xxxd3472xxx  was determined for 1 h at room
temperature. efflux of [3h]pah was measured for 30 min at room
temperature after injection of 46 nl of [3h]pah using oocyte ringer’s
solution (as a control), chloride-free oocyte ringer’s solution, and chloride-free oocyte ringer’s solution plus 500 ␮m es as extracellular
incubation solutions.

transport measurements in hek293 cells
hek293- xxxg2109xxx  and hek293-control cells were harvested and plated
into 24-well plastic dishes (sarstedt, nümbrecht, germany) at a density of
2 ⫻ 105 cells/well. transport assays were performed 48 h after seeding in
mammalian ringer solution that contained (in mm) 130 nacl, 4 kcl, 1
cacl2, 1  xxxd2534xxx , 1 nah2po4, 20 hepes, and 18 glucose at a ph of 7.4. the
cells were washed twice with 500 ␮l of buffer and incubated in buffer that
contained 10 nm [3h]es or 20 ␮m 6-cf for 2 min or 30 s, respectively. in
some cases, the solutions also included additional test substances as described in the figure legends. for trans-stimulation experiments, cells were
preloaded for 2 h with 10 mm test substances before uptake. the incubation was stopped and the extracellular tracer was removed by washing the
monolayer twice with 750 ␮l of ice-cold pbs. subsequently, cells were
dissolved in 0.5 ml of 1 n naoh, and for assessment of 6-cf accumulation, fluorescence was measured in a fluorescence spectrophotometer (hitachi, tokyo, japan) at 492/512 nm (excitation/emission). the kinetics of
6-cf uptake was described adequately by the following michaelis-menten
equation fitted by nonlinear regression with sigmaplot 2001 (spss science,
chicago, il):

cdna clone
 xxxg2109xxx  (genebank accession no. al514126) was obtained from invitrogen cloned into psport6 expression vector. the clone was sequence-verified using an automated sequencer (abi, weiterstadt, germany). sequence analysis was done by online services (e.g., map,

where j is the rate of transport of a labeled organic anion, jmax is the
maximum rate of mediated transport, and km is the substrate concentration that resulted in half-maximal transport. the 3h and 14c contents
of cells, oocytes, or supernatants were determined by liquid scintillation counting (canberra-packard, dreieich, germany).

stable transfection of  xxxg2109xxx  into hek293 cells
the stably transfected human epithelial kidney cell line t-rexhek293- xxxg2109xxx  was established by using the flp-in expression system
(invitrogen) as described previously (21). cells were grown in flasks in
dmem (high glucose; invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fcs, 1%
penicillin/streptomycin, and blasticidine (5 mg/l; sigma-aldrich,
schnelldorf, germany). cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere that contained 5% co2 at 37°c.

the psport6- xxxg2109xxx  construct was used for crna synthesis. after
noti linearization of the plasmid, in vitro transcription was carried out
using the sp6 mmessage mmachine kit (ambion, austin, tx) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. the crna was resuspended in water

expression and transport measurements of  xxxg2109xxx  in
xenopus laevis oocytes
oocytes from xenopus laevis ovaries (nasco, fort atkinson, wi) were
prepared, injected, and cultivated as previously detailed (22). transport

the time periods indicated in oocyte ringer’s solution that contained (in
mm) 90 nacl, 3 kcl, 2 cacl2, 1 mgcl2, and 5 hepes/tris (ph 7.6),
unless otherwise stated in the figure legends. oocytes then were

to prove their transport by  xxxg2109xxx , we performed tracer experiments with [3h]pah, [14c]glutarate, and [14c]urate. [3h]es
uptake served as a control.
hek293- xxxg2109xxx  cells accumulated 10-fold more es (185.5 ⫾

they showed virtually no uptake of [3h]pah or [14c]glutarate
compared with mock cells (figure 3, b and c). these results
suggest that  xxxg2109xxx  does not mediate uptake of pah or glutarate from the extra- to the intracellular compartment. hek293hoat4 cells showed a higher urate uptake than mock cells
(1.4-fold; p ⬍ 0.01; figure 3d).  xxxg2109xxx -mediated urate accumulation amounted to 7.7 ⫾ 2.4 pmol/mg protein ⫻ 5 min in
comparison with mock cells with an uptake of 4.5 ⫾ 1.0

was doubled in hurat1-expressing oocytes (figure 4a).
figure 4. urate uptake in xenopus laevis oocytes. a total of 23 ng

uptake of  xxxg2109xxx -expressing cells without  xxxd2294xxx  to 100%.

the commonly used diuretic  xxxd2294xxx  is known to cause a
decrease in urate excretion and hyperuricemia in patients
(23,24). injecting 1 mm  xxxd2294xxx  into x. laevis oocytes resulted in
a significant 2.6-fold increase of  xxxg2109xxx -mediated  xxxd3472xxx 
uptake compared with ringer-injected  xxxg2109xxx -expressing oocytes. therefore, efflux of  xxxd2294xxx  can drive urate uptake (figure

for further characterization of transport mode and driving

efflux of [3h]pah mediated by  xxxg2109xxx -injected

to confirm and explore further the mechanism of pah release via  xxxg2109xxx , we determined [3h]pah efflux by hoat4expressing oocytes providing oocyte ringer’s solution (as a
control) and chloride-free oocyte ringer’s solution with or
without 500 ␮m es. oocyte ringer’s solution revealed an almost two-times higher [3h]pah efflux than mock oocytes (figure 6). this  xxxg2109xxx -mediated efflux was abolished using chloride-free oocyte ringer’s solution but restored in the presence

of es, indicating  xxxg2109xxx -mediated pah/cl⫺ or pah/es exchange.

ph-dependent 6-cf and es uptake by hek293hoat4 cells
next, we examined the ph dependence of  xxxg2109xxx -mediated
transport. acidification of the uptake medium to ph 5.5 led to
a 3.6-fold (360.8 ⫾ 30.8%) increase of 6-cf uptake and an
elevation of es uptake to 156 ⫾ 4.2% in comparison with
 xxxg2109xxx -mediated uptake at ph 7.4. alkalization of the medium
to ph 8.0 led to a significant (p ⬍ 0.001) inhibition of 6-cf and
es uptake to 49.8 ⫾ 4.0 and 75.2 ⫾ 3.3%, respectively (figure 7).
 xxxg2109xxx  mediated [3h]es uptake at ph 5.5 in the presence of
nigericin was decreased significantly by 23.8 ⫾ 1.6% (p ⬍ 0.001)
in comparison with [3h]es uptake in the absence of nigericin.
these results document a marked ph dependence of  xxxg2109xxx 
and suggest a  xxxg2109xxx -mediated exchange of organic anions
against oh⫺ ions.
a possible functional coupling of  xxxg2109xxx  to  xxxg2162xxx  was examined by sodium-dependent es uptake. the replacement of
sodium by choline should inhibit the activity of the na⫹/h⫹
exchanger and consequently lower the in ⬎ out oh⫺ ion gradient. as shown in figure 8a, we observed a significant reduction of  xxxg2109xxx -mediated es uptake to 71.5 ⫾ 2.3%, when sodium was replaced by choline. an exchange of sodium by
potassium resulted in the same reduction of es uptake (68.4 ⫾

changer, we used the nhe inhibitor amiloride (25) and measured es uptake by hek293- xxxg2109xxx  cells in the absence or
presence of 1 mm amiloride. as shown in figure 8b, the presence of 1 mm amiloride significantly reduced es uptake to
67.2 ⫾ 5.6% (p ⬍ 0.001) compared with es uptake in the
absence of amiloride (100.0 ⫾ 3.4%). this result is similar to the
finding of na⫹ removal (figure 8a), indicating a functional
coupling of  xxxg2109xxx  to the na⫹/h⫹ exchanger.

inorganic ion-dependent  xxxg2109xxx -mediated es uptake
hurat1 as the closely related transporter to  xxxg2109xxx  uses
chloride as a driving force for  xxxd3472xxx  uptake (11). to examine
whether  xxxg2109xxx  transport activity is chloride dependent, we
replaced chloride in the transport buffer by gluconate and
performed es uptake. in chloride-free medium, es uptake by

discussion
the genes of  xxxg2109xxx  and hurat1 are speculated to be
derived from one ancestor in the late phase of higher primate
evolution (17). although a physical coupling and regulation of
both transporters via pdzk1 and nherf1 proteins was reported recently (26), current functional characteristics of
 xxxg2109xxx  and hurat1 illustrate different physiologic roles
(11,12).
in earlier vesicle studies, roch-ramel et al. (19) postulated the
existence of two different urate exchangers, one with high
affinity for urate and aromatic molecules, such as nicotinate,
pyrazinoate, and  xxxd2794xxx , which now is represented by
hurat1, and a second, low-affinity urate transporter that exchanges urate against oa or chloride (27). moreover, they

figure 9. chloride dependence of hek293- xxxg2109xxx  mediated es
uptake. for evaluation of the chloride dependence of [3h]es
uptake by hek293- xxxg2109xxx  cells, chloride was replaced in the
uptake medium by gluconate. 䡺, mock cells; f, s, hoat4expressing cells. all experiments were standardized by setting

demonstrated that an oh⫺ ion gradient provokes urate uptake
into human brush border membrane vesicles (bbmv), a transport mode, which is not covered by hurat1 (11). the molecular identity of this transporter so far is unknown.
to reevaluate the physiologic role and mode of action of
 xxxg2109xxx , we generated a hek293- xxxg2109xxx  stably transfected cell
line. 6-cf uptake into hek293- xxxg2109xxx  cells was time and concentration dependent with a km of 108 ␮m, which qualifies
 xxxg2109xxx  as a low-affinity transporter for 6-cf compared with
 xxxg2113xxx  with a km value of 3.9 ␮m (28). cis-inhibition studies
revealed almost total inhibition by es, dehydroepiandrosterone
sulfate, and probenecid, consistent with the hallmarks of
 xxxg2109xxx  transport characteristics (12). in addition, urate significantly reduced 6-cf uptake, whereas all other tested compounds, including pah, glutarate, and the hurat1 substrates
l-lactate, pyrazinoate,  xxxd2794xxx , and nicotinate, exhibited only a
slight or no significant alteration of 6-cf or es uptake, indicating a clear difference in the specificities of  xxxg2109xxx  and
hurat1.
it is interesting that urate preloading of the cells did not
result in a significant increase of 6-cf or es uptake, suggesting
an affinity of  xxxg2109xxx  for urate only from the extracellular side.
further evidence for an asymmetric mode of action of  xxxg2109xxx 
was provided by experiments with radioactively labeled pah,
glutarate, and urate.  xxxg2109xxx  did not show any significant
[3h]pah or [14c]glutarate uptake, but intracellular pah and

j am soc nephrol 18: 430 – 439, 2007

glutarate trans-stimulated es uptake. these observations are
supported further by efflux studies using [3h]pah. oat4mediated pah efflux (and therefore secretion of oa into the
urine) takes place in the presence of es or a physiologically
inwardly directed cl⫺ gradient. the lack of interaction of pah
with  xxxg2109xxx  from the extracellular side was observed already
by ugele et al. (16) in  xxxg2109xxx -expressing human mononuclear
trophoblasts, documenting a cell system–independent property
of  xxxg2109xxx . cha et al. (12) found no inhibition of  xxxg2109xxx -mediated es uptake by 0.5 mm pah but a low [14c]pah uptake by
 xxxg2109xxx , which, however, was not statistically significant. almost the same results were reported by zhou et al. (29) regarding no pah interaction with  xxxg2109xxx . these observations are in
good accordance with our data. however, recently, ekaratanawong et al. (15) reported a two-fold pah and glutarate uptake
by  xxxg2109xxx  expressed in mouse proximal tubule cells. they also
found a trans-stimulation of [14c]pah uptake by intracellular
glutarate and of [14c]glutarate uptake by intracellular pah. we
repeated these experiments using the same concentrations of
substrates on our hek293- xxxg2109xxx  cells but did not observe any
significant uptake of pah or glutarate. the reason for these
discrepancies is unknown.
[14c]urate uptake by hek293- xxxg2109xxx  cells as well as
 xxxg2109xxx -expressing oocytes using plasma-equivalent (up to 400
␮m) concentrations demonstrate for the first time that  xxxg2109xxx 
is a urate transporter that shares this important physiologic
function with hurat1. urate is the end product of purine
metabolism in higher primates, including human, and is excreted mainly via the kidneys. the fractional excretion of urate
in these species is low (feurate approximately 10%). the resulting high urate plasma levels are discussed to offer an advantage during hominoid evolution, because of the compensatory
effect of urate for blood pressure regulation under low-salt-diet
conditions (30 –32). hurat1 possesses an intermediate affinity
for urate of km ⫽ 371 ␮m and is held to be responsible for 50%
of renal urate reabsorption (11,33). this assumption is supported by the fact that mutations in the hurat1 gene substantially elevate feurate up to 60% and lead to the clinical manifestation of idiopathic hypouricemia (11,34). it is interesting
that according to the recently postulated four-component
model of urate handling in the kidneys (33,35) and that patients
without any mutations in the hurat1 gene show hypouricemia, other apical urate transporters were postulated (36), one of
which might be  xxxg2109xxx . we determined a concentration-dependent inhibition of  xxxg2109xxx -mediated es uptake (ic50) by
urate of 925 ␮m (data not shown), consistent with  xxxg2109xxx 
representing a low-affinity urate transporter compared with
hurat1 (11).
urate is a potent endogenous free radical scavenger that
protects the body and, most important, the brain against oxidative damage (37). besides the kidneys,  xxxg2109xxx  is expressed in
placenta (12), where hurat1 was not detected and where
urate plays an important role, especially within the first trimester, a time when antioxidant enzyme activity and the levels of
reducing agents such as glutathione or ␣- and ␥-tocopherol are
low (38). in this most vulnerable phase of fetal development,
when oxidative stress has a substantial impact on normal organ

j am soc nephrol 18: 430 – 439, 2007

growing,  xxxg2109xxx  may be responsible for the placental urate
homeostasis and consequently for the protection of the fetus
from oxidative damage.
the interaction of diuretics such as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, loop diuretics, and thiazides with human oat is well
documented (18).  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  facilitate the basolateral
entry of these drugs into the proximal tubule cell and therefore
are responsible for the first step of active secretion of many of
these compounds. hurat1 was shown to interact with the
loop diuretics bumetanide and furosemide (11), whereas
 xxxg2109xxx  was noted to interact preferentially with furosemide
and  xxxd2049xxx  but possesses virtually no affinity for carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and thiazides (18). it is widely
known that patients who are treated with thiazides become
hyperuricemic (24). we tested the inhibitory and trans-stimulatory effect of  xxxd2294xxx  on hek293- xxxg2109xxx  –mediated es and
urate uptake and found little interaction of  xxxg2109xxx  with  xxxd2294xxx 
from the extracellular (cis-) side. importantly, we found that
urate uptake via  xxxg2109xxx  is elevated substantially (2.6-fold) by
intracellular  xxxd2294xxx . consequently,  xxxd2294xxx -induced hyperuricemia could be explained by the following mechanism:  xxxd2294xxx 
enters the proximal tubule cell at the basolateral side through
 xxxg2113xxx  and is released into the urine via  xxxg2109xxx , driving the
reabsorption of urate.
an increasing body of evidence supports the notion that gout
should not be considered as the only consequence of hyperuricemia. a higher risk for development of cardiovascular diseases and hypertension (30,31) as a result of urate-induced
vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and endothelial cell
dysfunction (39,40) is currently discussed in the context of
elevated urate plasma levels. hence, urate is postulated to be a
risk factor for the development of essential hypertension (41),
and  xxxg2109xxx , therefore, may play an important role in maintaining high urate levels.
urate uptake into human renal bbmv was noted to be
strongly stimulated by an outwardly directed cl⫺ gradient (19).
we found that es uptake is enhanced with the removal of
extracellular chloride, suggesting that  xxxg2109xxx , like hurat1
(11) and npt1 (6), can use chloride as an exchange anion for es
as well as urate (data not shown) uptake. in view of the physiologically inwardly directed cl⫺ gradient in the proximal tubule, our pah efflux experiments clearly show that  xxxg2109xxx 
represents the apical one-way efflux avenue for pah and consequently several drugs via pah/cl⫺, pah/es, and possibly
pah/urate exchange.
in human, dog, and rat bbmv, urate uptake was stimulated
by an outwardly directed oh⫺ gradient (42,43). hurat1 was
shown not to operate as a urate/oh⫺ exchanger (11). by acidification of the extracellular medium, in which 6-cf and es are
independent of the applied ph still in its anionic form, hoat4mediated uptake of both substrates was stimulated. this effect
was reduced significantly in the presence of the proton-ionophore nigericin, supporting the idea of a 6-cf/oh⫺, es/oh⫺,
and urate/oh⫺ exchange as possible transport modes of
 xxxg2109xxx . a measurement of the intracellular ph values using a
fluorescence tracer revealed a drop of the intracellular ph value
in hek293- xxxg2109xxx  cells in the presence of es (data not shown),

 xxxg2109xxx  operates as an asymmetric exchanger

437

confirming es/oh⫺ exchange mediated by  xxxg2109xxx . the intracellular ph of the proximal tubule cells and, thereby, the oh⫺
gradient is maintained by the luminal sodium-proton exchanger  xxxg2162xxx  (44). we observed a significant decrease of es
uptake in hek293- xxxg2109xxx  cells after removal of sodium or by
addition of the  xxxg2162xxx -specific inhibitor amiloride, suggesting a
possible coupling of  xxxg2109xxx  transport to the action of  xxxg2162xxx .
the expression of  xxxg2162xxx  in hek cells is well documented (45).
whereas hurat1 is functionally connected to the recently
identified sodium- xxxg2090xxx  (46), which
facilitates sodium-dependent reabsorption of l-lactate, pyrazinoate, and nicotinate,  xxxg2109xxx  rather is coupled to the action of
 xxxg2162xxx  and the sodium-dicarboxylate transporter 1, which is
involved in the maintenance of the intracellular ␣-ketoglutarate
(47). this again becomes important if patients are treated long
term with thiazides. recently, nijenhuis et al. (48) provided
evidence that the thiazide-induced hypocalciuria is due to an
increased na⫹ reabsorption via  xxxg2162xxx  in the proximal tubule
caused by the thiazide-induced contraction of the extracellular
volume. consequently, we speculate that another mechanism
for a thiazide-induced hyperuricemia is given by the higher
activity of  xxxg2162xxx , which drives urate/oh⫺ exchange specifically through  xxxg2109xxx .

conclusion
we provide evidence that  xxxg2109xxx , like hurat1, is a urate
transporter that operates as an asymmetric exchanger. we document two possible ways for a reasonable involvement of
 xxxg2109xxx  in  xxxd2294xxx -associated hyperuricemia. moreover, the observed chloride dependence of  xxxg2109xxx  is well reflected in a
pah/cl⫺ exchange mode, facilitating the secretion of pah and
consequently a wide array of oa by using the physiologic
chloride gradient into the urine. finally, we conclude that
 xxxg2109xxx  represents the long-postulated apical low-affinity
urate/oh⫺ exchanger.
