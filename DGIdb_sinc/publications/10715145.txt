introduction. nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
(nsaids) are among the most widely used prescription
and over the counter medications, used primarily for
the treatment of pain and inflammation, particularly
arthritis. in the 1970s, it was demonstrated that aspirin
and other nsaids block the formation of prostaglandins
(pgs) produced from  xxxd208xxx  by the enzyme
cyclooxygenase (cox), sometimes called prostaglandin
synthase.1 pgs are produced by most cells, and their
presence in tissues elicits a broad array of biological
responses. most notably, pgs in the gastrointestinal
tract are cytoprotective, in the kidney they are responsible for normal renal function, and they allow platelets
to aggregate. pgs mediate a number of characteristic
features of the body’s response to tissue injury or
inflammation. dilation of small blood vessels leading
to development of redness and heat is mediated by pgs.
they contribute to an increase in vascular permeability
leading to the characteristic swelling of tissues. in
addition, pgs sensitize peripheral nerve endings to
transmit pain signals to the brain and spinal cord. thus,
it is now known that pgs play an important role in
pathologic as well as physiologic processes.
consumption of nsaids for inflammatory diseases
unavoidably leads to blockade of pgs required for
normal physiology. it is now evident that the therapeutic effects and side effects of this class of drug are related
to their mechanism of action. the first-line mode of
therapeutic intervention of chronic inflammatory diseases such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis
is nsaids. as a consequence, nsaid users suffer from
a high incidence of gastrointestinal irritation, including
the development of life-threatening gastrointestinal
ulcers.2 additionally, consumption of nsaids can lead
to abnormal renal physiology.3,4 more advanced means
of treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases are
glucocorticoids and immunosuppressives that possess
an even greater array of side effects.5
until the latter part of the 1980s, most researchers
in the prostaglandin field felt that the formation of pgs
was limited only by the available pool of arachidonic
acid. several observations suggested this view was not
entirely accurate. it was found that the amount of cox

protein in inflamed tissues was appreciably higher than
in normal tissues.6 the amount of cox could be
increased by stimulating cells with selected cytokines
such as interleukin-1,  xxxg2300xxx , or bacterial endotoxin.
the increase in cox protein synthesis was found to be
blocked by glucocorticoids, whereas the level of free
 xxxd208xxx  did not appreciably change.7,8 these
observations led to the hypothesis that a second form
of cox existed. in 1991, the inducible form of the
enzyme, cox-2, was cloned.9-11 the cloned cox-2 was
the same as a unique form of the enzyme that had
previously been reported.12,13 it is now known that the
constitutive enzyme (cox-1) is expressed in essentially
all tissues, whereas cox-2 expression is largely absent
unless induced by inflammatory stimuli. the discovery
of a second enzyme, intimately associated with inflammatory states, led to the hypothesis that selective
inhibitors of cox-2 would be antiinflammatory with
diminished side effects.
since the mid-1990s, a number of reports have appeared on the preparation and biological activity of
selective cox-2 inhibitors.14 recently we detailed the
synthesis and biological profile of celecoxib (1).15 as part
of our continuing efforts to identify inhibitors with
greater potency and high specificity for cox-2, we
prepared a series of diarylisoxazole derivatives that
possess exceptional antiinflammatory properties. herein
we detail our study on two of the diarylisoxazole cox-2
inhibitors. this research effort culminated in the identification of  xxxd3481xxx  ( xxxd3481xxx , 2) which is currently
in clinical evaluation for the management of pain and
inflammation.

chemistry. the synthesis of 2 was very concise and
is outlined in scheme 1. deoxybenzoin was converted
to the corresponding oxime by treatment with hydroxylamine hydrochloride in the presence of sodium acetate.16 deprotonation of the oxime with 2 equiv of
butyllithium followed by condensation with ethyl acetate afforded isoxazoline 4.17 treatment of 4 with
chlorosulfonic acid followed by reaction of the incipient
sulfonyl chloride with aqueous ammonia afforded 2 in
good yield.
after some experimentation, a workable method for
the preparation of 3 was identified, scheme 2. the route
involved condensation of the dianion of deoxybenzoin

results and discussion. as an initial screen for
activity, 2 was evaluated against human recombinant
cox-1 and cox-2 enzymes.19 against cox-1 2 showed
weak inhibitory activity with an ic50 ) 140 ( 19 µm (n

against cox-2 with an ic50 ) 0.005 ( 0.001 µm (n )

was evaluated in human whole blood.20 for assessment
of the extent of cox-2 inhibition, human heparinized
whole blood was cultured with lipopolysaccharide (lps)
overnight in the presence of inhibitor, and plasma was
assayed for pge2 production as a function of cox-2
inhibition. for cox-1 activity, inhibitors were added
to heparinized whole blood for 15 min prior to the
addition of calcium ionophore, a-23187. after 10 min,
plasma was collected for analysis of txb2 as a function
of cox-1 activity, table 1. as summarized in table 2,
2 showed potent oral activity in an acute antiinflammatory assay [rat carrageenan foot pad edema;21 ed50

) 10.2 ( 1.4 mg/kg (n ) 2)]. chronic antiinflammatory
activity was achieved with 2 in the rat adjuvant
arthritis model22 [ed50 ) 0.032 ( 0.002 mg/kg/day (n
) 2)], a potency exceeding that obtained with the most
potent nsaids. blockade of prostaglandin production
at the inflammatory site was demonstrated in the rat
carrageenan air pouch model23 [ed50 ) 0.05 ( 0.02 mg/
kg (n ) 2)]. these data indicate that 2 is a highly potent
and selective inhibitor of cox-2 that possesses excellent
oral activity as an antiinflammatory in animal models
typically used to develop nsaids.
additionally, 2 is converted in vivo in rodents and
dogs, and in very low abundance in humans, to an active
metabolite 3. in vitro 3 showed an ic50 ) 1120 ( 198
µm (n ) 6) against cox-1 and an ic50 ) 0.18 ( 0.04
µm (n ) 7) against cox-2, table 1. pharmacological
evaluation of independently synthesized 3 showed it
possessed oral activity in the acute antiinflammatory
assay [carrageenan paw edema; ed50 ) 1.06 ( 0.01 mg/
kg (n ) 3)]. chronic antiinflammatory activity was
achieved with 3 in the rat adjuvant arthritis model
[ed50 ) 1.49 ( 0.37 mg/kg/day (n ) 3)]. compound 3,
while more potent in the carrageenan paw edema assay
than 2, was less potent against the isolated enzyme and
in the air pouch or adjuvant arthritis assays. these
seemingly incongruous data likely reflect the different
pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of these two
compounds in the different animal models.
conclusion. we have shown that 2 is a highly
selective and potent inhibitor of cox-2 in human whole
blood and against the recombinant human enzyme. in
animal models of acute and chronic inflammation, 2
showed exceptional potency after oral administration.
an active metabolite, 3, formed in rodents and dogs was
also found to be a cox-2-selective inhibitor.  xxxd3481xxx 
(2) is currently in clinical evaluation for the treatment
of arthritis and pain.
