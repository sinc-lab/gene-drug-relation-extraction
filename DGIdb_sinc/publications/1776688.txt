the nature and occurrence of the various mammalian
enzymes which cleave acetylcholine
and other choline
esters have been nicely summarized in a recent monograph (1). being collectively referred to as cholinesterases, these enzymes are typically
divided into two
groups. the first group, with the systematic name acetylcholine acetylhydrolase ( xxxg38xxx ), occurs in neurochemically
excitable tissue, neuromuscular
junctions,
and erythrocytes; it is commonly called acetylcholinesterase (ache)’ or true cholinesterase.

group, the subject of the current report, has the systematic name acetylcholine acylhydrolase ( xxxg248xxx ) and
is found to occur in blood plasma and serum and many
tissues of animals. this second family of enzymes,
which includes at least 15 distinct isozymes (2), has been
referred to as plasma cholinesterase, serum cholinesterase,  xxxg248xxx ,
 xxxg248xxx ,
or,
simply, cholinesterase. throughout
the current report,
we use the term cholinesterase
(che) exclusively to
refer to the acetylcholine
acylhydrolase family of isozymes.
the activity of che may be influenced by drugs (3),
physiological states like age (4), pregnancy (5), and sex
(4), genetically determinedconditions
(6), andpathological conditions like infectious hepatitis (7). clinical determinations
of che activity can provide insight pertaining to these various states. for example, primary
liver diseases such as infectious hepatitis or hepatic cirrhosis exhibit lower enzyme activity due to a decreased
capacity of the liver, which is responsible for production
of the enzyme (7). improvements
in prognosis correspond to increased levels of serum che activity.
reduced enzyme activity has also been observed in
carcinoma (a), malnutrition
(9), genetically atypical individuals (lo), and following treatment with pesticides
such as diisopropyl  xxxd3217xxx ,
dfp, a potent
inhibitor
of acetylcholinesterase
and cholinesterase
(11). on the other hand, elevated che levels have been
demonstrated
in a variety of disorders including nephrotic syndrome (12) and thyrotoxicosis
(13).
hence, we developed an assay to measure the activity
of che in serum via liquid chromatography
with electrochemical detection (lcec). in the plasma and serum,
che exhibits substantial activity, whereas ache does
not (14). thus, acetylcholine
(ach) can reasonably be
used as a substrate to determine the activity of che in
plasma and serum. this activity was assessed by monitoring the amount of choline (ch) formed during incubation. both the ch and the internal standard, ethylhomocholine
(ehc), are measured indirectly,
following
chromatographic
separation, through reaction with im377

mobilized choline oxidase to produce the electrochemitally active h,o,. the same postcolumn reactor containing choline oxidase also contains immobilized
ache to allow detection of ach via similar production
of h,o,. this lcec arrangement is based upon that
originally described by potter et al. (15) with the enzyme
immobilization
of yao and sato (16). a similar approach has recently been reported by kaneda et al. (17)
for the determination of true ache activity in tissue
samples.
after optimization of the assay, we investigated the
che activity in male albino mice treated with dfp.
dfp is representative of a number of phosphate ester
derived insecticides and is similar in its mode of action
to potential chemical warfare agents (11). the action of
dfp on both ache and serum che is of particular concern in cases of human exposure since the che inhibition persists for at least 15-17 days after moderate inhalation doses (18).

light/dark cycle with lights on  xxxd2274xxx  am. no animals were
used in experiments until at least 7 days after receipt
from the supplier.
apparatus.
the liquid chromatographic system was
similar to that previously described (20). the analytical
column was a 3.2 mm x 10 cm, 3 pm ods cartridge unit
obtained from bioanalytical systems (west lafayette,
in). the 3.5-cm postcolumn reactor, prepared in-house,
contained 60 units of ache and 60 units of choline oxidase (cho), according to the description of yao and
sato (16). the purified ache and cho, as well as the

definition of units for each, were supplied by sigma.
 xxxd2298xxx  production was monitored electrochemically at a platinum electrode with e,pp = 0.50 v vs
ag/agcl.
the mobile phase, prepared fresh every 3 days to
avoid bacterial growth, consisted of a 20 mm  xxxd3449xxx ,
ph 7.50, containing 4.6 ml glacial acetic acid, 1.0 mm
 xxxd3337xxx 
chloride, 200 pm octyl sodium
sulfate, 6.0 mm sodium azide, 67 pm edta, and 2.0%
(vol/vol) acetonitrile. the solution, filtered prior to use
through a 0.45-pm millipore membrane, was typically
used at a flow rate of 0.90 ml/min and a pressure of
2000 psi.
procedure. standard stock solutions of ch (4.00
mm), ehc (8.00 mm), and ach (500 mm) were prepared
in a weak acetate buffer; the buffer contained 3.0 ml of
glacial acetic acid in 1.00 liter of deionized water and
was adjusted to a ph of 4.50 with dilute naoh. these
were stored frozen at -80°c. the incubation buffer
consisted of 0.100 m phosphate buffer of ph 7.20, prepared by adjusting the ph of 0.100 m kh,po, with concentrated naoh. approximately
500 ~1 of blood was
obtained, when required, by cardiac puncture of the
mouse. after sitting at room temperature for 15 min,
followed by centrifugation at 1ooogfor 10 min, this
yielded approximately 200 ~1 of serum. the serum samples were stored at -80°c until analysis, which occurred
within 2 weeks. the stability of che during this procedure is of no major concern, since it is reported stable
for 30 days at 4°c and several years at -20°c (21).
on the day of analysis, an appropriate number of
blanks, external standards, and serum samples were
prepared according to table 1, with all items except the

serum

cholinesterase

diluted serum and hclo, being added in advance. diluted serum was prepared by adding 50 ~1 of serum to
200 ~1 of isotonic saline. the enzyme reaction commenced with the addition of 25.0 ~1 of the diluted serum
and was allowed to continue for exactly 10 min at room
temperature
(22’c). cessation of enzymatic hydrolysis
of ach was produced by addition of 25.0 ~1 of 2.50 m
hclo, and vortexing for ca. 10 s immediately
thereafter. blanks were treated exactly the same as serum samples to correct for any nonenzymatic
hydrolysis;
however, both blanks and standards
received 25 ~1 of water
instead of the diluted serum. the samples were filtered
through 0.45-pm nitrocellulose
filters by low-speed centrifugation
for approximately
30 s and collected in 1.5ml polypropylene
sample tubes. a 20-~1 aliquot of the
filtrate was injected into the lcec for determination
of
the choline produced by hydrolysis.
the che activity, expressed as micromoles of choline
produced/ml

the formula for the determination
of che activity,
employing
blanks prepared as described
in table 1,
corrects for nonenzymatic
hydrolysis
of the substrate.
however,
it does not correct for the observed time lag
between addition of hclo, and actual reaction termination; in fact, the blank was specifically designed to allow
investigation
of this phenomena.
correction
for the
time lag can be achieved by two separate approaches.
since the extrapolated
activity of che obtained at 0 min
using hclo, inactivation,
vide infra, represents
8.8% of
that obtained for a lo-min incubation,
one can simply
multiply
the individual
activities
obtained using the
above formula by a factor of 0.912 (=l.ooo - 0.088).
alternatively,
one could alter the content and treatment
of the blanks. in this approach, the blanks would receive
25 ~1 of the diluted serum instead of the prescribed 25 ~1
of water; the blanks so treated would be incubated for
the prescribed 10 minprior to the addition of the diluted

activity

serum, and the perchloric acid would be added immediately after the addition of the serum. this second approach is recommended
for routine analyses. however,
for simplicity
and consistency,
the former method, i.e.,
multiplication
of individual results by a factor of 0.912,
was employed in the current investigation.

general assay optimization.
optimization
of enzyme
incubation
parameters,
discussed
below, actually occurred in a cyclical process. initial investigations,
not
reported here, of the effect of each of the parameters
on
the observed activity resulted in the final che analysis
conditions
reported above under experimental.
using
the optimized conditions,
we investigated
each parameter to both verify its establishment
as the optimum and
to derive the additional information
presented.
reaction termination.
in order to terminate the enzymatic hydrolysis
of ach, an appropriate
reagent or condition must be applied to the reaction in progress. three
enzyme inactivation
procedures,
namely, (i) addition of
physostigmine,
(ii) addition of hclo,, and (iii) heating
in a water bath were investigated
and assessed for their
effectiveness.
initial investigations
indicated some delay between the applied termination
condition and the
actual cessation of serum che activity. each termination condition was, therefore,
examined using various
incubation times. the extrapolation
of these results was
then employed to determine the interval between the
application
of the terminating
condition
and the
achievement
of actual termination.
one of the easiest methods which can be employed for
reaction termination
simply involves addition of a deproteinizing
reagent. the selection of hclo, as the deproteinizing
agent also enhances preservation
of the
sample following
incubation
by lowering the ph and,
thereby, reducing nonenzymatic
hydrolysis
of the substrate. preliminary
investigations
employed 25 ~1 of
10.0, 2.5, and 1.25 m hcio,. the 1.25 m hcio, did not
adequately stop the enzymatic reaction and was, hence,
discarded.
the two higher concentrations
both effectively acidified the reaction mixture,
achieving measured ph values below 2.0. however,
the chromatograms resulting
from the use of 10.0 m hclo, were
undesirable
for two reasons. first, samples inactivated
by this higher concentration
of hclo, produced extensive solvent fronts, obscuring the early eluting ch peak.
secondly, the chromatographic
resolution between the
ch and ehc peaks in such samples was decreased by
approximately
10% when compared to samples inactivated with 2.5 m hcio,. using 25 ~1 of 2.5 m hcio, for
inactivation,
the measured activity as a function of incubation time was determined, as shown in fig. 1. these
results indicate that enzyme inactivation

incubation. the stock solutions of physostigmine
were
prepared daily and protected from light; lack of degradation was assured through a lack of observation of the
distinctive
pink color of rubrescerine.
the resulting
che activity, determined
as a function of incubation
time, is also illustrated in fig. 1. the lack of linearity in
these results obtained
with physostigmine
is not
currently understood. additionally,
it was felt that the
presence of solutions having such a high concentration
of physostigmine
would be a possible biological hazard.
thus, reaction termination
by physostigmine
was eliminated.
buffer ph and ionic strength.
the ph optimization
of the che assay was investigated by using various solutions of 0.100 m phosphate buffer. used in prior colorimetric assays (24,25), this buffer material exhibited favorable physical properties over the investigated ph
range of 5.50-8.50 at increments of 0.50 ph units. all
buffers were prepared by taking a solution of 0.100 m
kh,po,
and adjusting to the desired ph with concentrated naoh. examination
of the results, shown in fig.
2, yields an optimum
of 114.6 + 0.1 pmol/ml/h
at ph
7.00. the activity was considerably less at lower ph values. however, only a small and insignificant
decrease in
activity, to 114.1 + 1.4 pmol/ml/h,
was obtained using
the separately investigated ph value of 7.20. thus, ph

within approximately
0.7 min following the addition of
hclo,.
one of the most commonly employed che inactivation procedures utilizes heating of the incubation mixture in a water bath (22). in these investigations,
a
beaker was filled with distilled water and maintained at
70 + 2°c on a hot plate. the reaction mixture, contained in a 1.5ml polypropylene
tube, was inactivated
by immersion
in the beaker for 5 min. the resulting
activity, measured as a function of the incubation time,
is also presented in fig. 1. extrapolation
of the results
indicated that this approach required approximately
3.1
min between the initial immersion
of the incubation
mixture and subsequent inactivation
of the enzyme.
aside from this relatively long inactivation
time, this
approach suffers from being both time consuming and
awkward in comparison to the simple addition of hclo,
described above. therefore, heat inactivation
was eliminated from further consideration.
blockade of the che enzyme was also attempted as a
reaction termination
condition. in these investigations,
25 ~1 of 10.0 mm physostigmine,
a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor (23), was added to the mixture following

while maintaining
a high activity for the assay.
the effect of the ionic strength of the buffer was investigated at ph 7.20 by employing various phosphate
concentrations
between 1.00 and 300 mm. the results of
this experiment
are shown in fig. 3. despite the optimum of 114.2 f 0.5 pmol/ml/hr

an activity of 104.0 f 1.1 pmol/ml/hr,
was accepted in
order to retain a higher degree of buffering
capacity.
using the ph 7.20, 0.100 m phosphate
buffer, a measured ph value of 7.16 was achieved in the actual incubation mixture.
the linearity of the observed
enzyme concentration.
che activity with respect to the amount of added original mouse blood serum was investigated
to include a
range from 0.625 to 100.0 ~1. retaining a constant volume of 625 ~1 for the assay, the buffer volume was decreased to compensate for serum volumes greater than
25.0 ~1. for serum volumes less than 25.0 ~1, dilutions of
the original serum with isotonic saline were performed.
as indicated in fig. 4, the measured activity is directly
proportional
to the amount of serum added throughout
the range of 0.625 to 10.0 ~1. at values above 20.0 ~1, the
results clearly deviate from linearity. based upon these

the detection limit of the current lcec assay was determined

using the procedure described for routine analysis. this is one to two orders of magnitude
lower than the detection limits reported for commonly
employed
spectrophotometric
procedures
(9,27). it
should also be noted that the lcec detection limit
stated here is relatively conservative. it could easily be
lowered an additional factor of 10 to 20 by simply doubling the reaction time and/or amount of original serum
employed and increasing the injection volume to 100 ~1.
none of these suggested additional
measures would
substantially
alter the precision or accuracy of the procedure.
the linear dynamic range of the prescribed procedure
was determined by consideration
of the range in which
the lcec exhibits a linear response to ch. the lowest
detected value of ch, as described, corresponds to 0.11
pmol/ml/h.
the largest amount of injected ch attempted, 7.45 nmol, also showed a response directly
proportional
to concentration.
this upper limit for ch
corresponds to a che activity of 269 pmol/ml/h.
thus,
the assay should exhibit linearity from at least 0.11 to
269 pmol/ml/h,
or over a range of approximately
three
decades.
the reproducibility
of this procedure is indicated by
results obtained with repetitive determinations
of the

preach offers an order of magnitude (or more) decrease
in detection limits compared to commonly employed colorimetric procedures. the linear dynamic range and detection limits are comparable to those reported for radiochemical (29) and flow injection (30) methods. the
analysis is based upon the reaction of che with ach to
produce ch. the results of the assay may thus be alternatively expressed as micromoles of ach hydrolyzed/
ml serum/h. the procedure requires only 5 ~1 of original
serum sample. the current chromatographic throughput of 5 samples per hour could be increased, if necessary, to approximately 12 samples per hour by simply
eliminating the ache in the preparation of the postcolumn reactor for the lcec setup. this would eliminate
the large chromatographic peak observed for the substrate, ach, and allow injections to be made every 5 min
instead of every 12 min. the procedure is highly reproducible and routinely yields less than 2% variation between replicate samples and 8% between animals.
various factors affecting the measurement of enzyme
activity were evaluated in developing this assay. the ph
optimum of 7.00 and the optimum phosphate buffer
strength of 0.050 m were slightly compromised in the
selection of the values of 7.20 and 0.100 m, respectively,
to be used for routine analysis. this compromise, however, decreases the maximal observed activity by only
9%, while offering considerably improved buffering capacity.

weighted analysis of wilkinson (26). all currently available methods for the determination of serum or plasma
che activity, in fact, do not measure the activity of a
single enzymatic entity. indeed, there are multiple isozymes which contribute to the measured che activity in
these methods (2). thus, their treatment as a single entity for kinetic analysis is not strictly correct. nonetheless, the measured values offer a means of comparison
between alternative techniques. in that regard, the
currently obtained k,,, values are reasonably comparable to that of 1.8 mm reported by foldes et al. (31) for
human serum che activity using the same substrate.
the effect of dfp on mouse serum che activity was
quite profound. animals treated with 6.3 mg/kg, ip, 24 h
prior to sacrifice yielded che activities which were only
22% of control values. this was a somewhat greater reduction than that reported by martin (32), who found
that a single dose of dfp, 1 mg/kg, iv, produced a reduction in mouse serum che to 35% of that of controls
when measured 8 h later and a reduction to 75% of that
of controls when measured 24 h later. this difference
between the current results and those of martin (32), of
course, could be explained by either the mode of injection or the dose employed. on the other hand, studies
employing rats appear to provide more comparable reductions in serum che. for example, davison (33) reported that 0.5 mglkg dfp inhibited rat serum che in a
manner that exhibited exponential recovery to 50% of
control values at 72 h following treatment. extrapolation of this data indicates that the che levels were approximately 21% of controls at 24 h following dfp
treatment. the same study by davison reported a reduction of true cholinesterase, or ache, in rat brain to
ca. 20% of controls at 24 h following the described treatment with dfp. by comparative inference, rats treated
with dfp, 1.0 mg/kg, im, shown by glow and richardson (34) to produce reductions in ache to 30% of that
of controls, would be expected to exhibit serum che
values 24 h after treatment which were approximately
30% of that of controls, again comparable to the current
results.
