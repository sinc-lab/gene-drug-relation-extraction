abstract
recombinant interleukin-2 (il-2) ( xxxg1173xxx , proleukin, chiron, emeryville, ca) is approved for treatment
of cancer patients and under investigation in hiv-infected individuals. however, treatment with  xxxg1173xxx 
is associated with toxicity, which may be due to its elicitation of inflammatory mediators from cells that express the intermediate-affinity  xxxg1175xxx . bay 50-4798, a novel il-2 analog, is a selective agonist for the
high-affinity receptor. it induces the proliferation of activated t cells with a potency similar to that of
 xxxg1173xxx  but has reduced activity on cells expressing the intermediate-affinity receptor. in the current study,
we compared cytokine responses elicited in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) cultures stimulated
with bay 50-4798 or  xxxg1173xxx . bay 50-4798 induced approximately 5-fold lower mean levels of endogenous il-2 than  xxxg1173xxx , and at least 50% lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis fctor- (tnf-), il-1, il-6, and interferon- (ifn-). furthermore, statistically significant reductions in the levels of  xxxg1180xxx , il-8, il-10, il-13, and granulocyte-macrophage  xxxg526xxx  (gm-csf)
were observed in response to bay 50-4798. these findings increase our understanding of the biologic action
of bay 50-4798 and suggest a mechanism by which it may exhibit better safety than  xxxg1173xxx  in humans.

introduction

i

nterleukin-2

(il-2), a pluripotent cytokine produced primarily by activated cd4 t cells, plays a crucial role in producing the normal immune response. it promotes proliferation
and expansion of activated t lymphocytes,1 potentiates b cell
growth,2 and activates monocytes3 and natural killer (nk)
cells.4 il-2 acts through two cell surface receptors, the highaffinity receptor comprising the  chain (cd25),  chain
( xxxg1175xxx ), and  chain ( xxxg1176xxx ), and the intermediate-affinity
receptor, comprising of the  and  chains, which are essential
for signal transduction.5
 xxxg1173xxx  is a recombinant version of human il-2 that has
demonstrated efficacy in patients with malignant melanoma and
metastatic renal cell carcinoma6 and is under investigation in
hiv-infected patients.7–10 clinical use of  xxxg1173xxx , however,
is associated with an unfavorable toxicity profile,11–14 which
may be due to elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines15,16
produced in response to il-2-induced activation of cells ex-

pressing the intermediate-affinity form ( xxxg1175xxx c) of the il-2
receptor.15,17–20
previously, we described a novel il-2 analog, bay 50-4798,
which is a selective agonist for the high-affinity  xxxg1175xxx 
( xxxg1175xxx ) expressed primarily on activated t cells.21 bay
50-4798 retains cysteine at position 125, which is substituted
with serine in  xxxg1173xxx  but differs from wild-type il-2 by
the substitution of arginine for asparagine at position 88. we
demonstrated by biacore studies that asp88 is critical for interactions with the  xxxg1175xxx   chain,21 similar to the spatially proximal asp20, which others have shown to be involved
in il-2/ xxxg1175xxx  interactions.22–25 the substitution in bay 504798 does not affect its proliferative activity on activated t cells
in vitro or its ability to elicit increases in the number of activated circulating t cells in chimpanzees.21 rather, the modification introduced in bay 50-4798 results in profoundly reduced binding to intermediate-affinity il-2 receptors expressed
on nk and other cell types,21,26 reduced proliferative activity
on human and primate nk cells and human resting t cells,21,27

superior tolerability in a small chimpanzee study,21 and an encouraging safety profile in a larger study in cynomolgus monkeys (a. fleser, c.-m.l. tseng, b. zhao, l. neyer, m. boes,
t. reynolds, and e. cheung, unpublished observations; e.n.

unpublished observations).
we describe here in vitro studies performed to further characterize the biologic activity of bay 50-4798 and elucidate its
mechanism of action, comparing secondary cytokine responses
of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) stimulated with bay 50-4798 and  xxxg1173xxx . because il-2 has
been reported to upregulate its own production,28,29 we first focused on secretion of endogenous il-2, which could confound
the selective action of bay 50-4798 if produced at high enough
levels to trigger the intermediate-affinity  xxxg1175xxx . second,
we assessed the effects of bay 50-4798 and  xxxg1173xxx  on
secondary inflammatory cytokines, given their potential involvement in the toxicity observed with  xxxg1173xxx .

materials and methods
preparation and stimulation of nk cells and
phytohemagglutinin (pha) blasts
pbmcs were obtained from advanced biotechnologies, inc.
(columbia, md) from donors who had undergone plateletpheresis following informed consent; dead cells and residual
erythrocytes were removed by density gradient centrifugation
over histopaque-1077 (sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo).
pha blasts were generated by culturing pbmcs for 3 days at
106/ml in complete medium supplemented with 10 g/ml
pha (sigma). nk cells were isolated by negative selection using a miltenyi biotec automacs and the miltenyi biotec nk
cell isolation kit (auburn, ca), following the manufacturer’s
protocol. cells were washed twice and resuspended for subsequent flow cytometry analysis and culture in rpmi 1640
medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (fbs) (gibco-brl, gaithersburg, md). cells were
seeded at 105/well in triplicate in 96-well microtiter plates with
the indicated cytokines and concentrations in a volume of 200
l and cultured at 37°c in 5% co2 for 3 days. cultures were
pulsed with 1 ci/well 3h-thymidine for the final 4–16 h of
incubation and harvested using a brandel 96-well automated
harvester (gaithersburg, md). proliferation, measured as the
amount of incorporated radioisotope, was determined using a
wallac 1450 microbeta liquid scintillation and luminescence
counter (turku, finland) and expressed as counts per minute
(cpm). t cell contamination of nk cell preparations was assessed by immunophenotyping and by examining their proliferative response to a t cell-selective antigen, staphylococcus
enterotoxin b (seb) (sigma) at 1 ng/ml.

sciences, piscataway, nj) and centrifuged at 400g for 30 min
at 20°c (without brake). the upper layer containing plasma and
platelets was discarded by aspiration. interface cells (lymphocytes and monocytes) were washed two to three times and finally resuspended in serum-free aim medium (gibco-brl).
viable cells, determined by trypan blue exclusion, were seeded
at concentrations of 2  105 cells/well in 96-well round-bottom
plates or 5  106 cells/well in 12-well plates.

il-2 analogs
in earlier research studies describing the generation of interleukin-2 selective agonist (il-2sa),21 we demonstrated that
the difference in the biologic (proliferative) response to il-2
(wt) and il-2sa (the research grade version of bay 50-4798)
was a function of differences in the proteins, not the excipients.21 because drugs are defined not only by their molecular
entities but also by their formulations, however, we chose to
compare clinical lots of  xxxg1173xxx  (proleukin, chiron,
emeryville, ca) and bay 50-4798 (bayer, berkeley, ca).
the specific activity of  xxxg1173xxx , reported as 18 miu/mg
(product prescribing information, chiron) is determined by
measuring proliferation of a murine t cell line (ctl-l).30 using this assay, the specific activity of bay 50-4798 was determined to be 23 miu/mg (data not shown). however, given
that  xxxg1173xxx  and bay 50-4798 exhibit equivalent potency
on activated human t cells,31 we believe it is more appropriate to report concentrations in mass and molarity rather than international units.

endogenous il-2: stimulation and measurement
of secreted protein
pbmcs were cultured in serum-free aim medium supplemented with either  xxxg1173xxx  or bay 50-4798 at a concentration of 1 nm (16 ng/ml). this concentration approximates
peak serum levels of immunologically active doses in cynomolgus monkeys21 (e.n. chung, p. lum, j. gibbons, m. boes, l.
neyer, and l. tseng, unpublished observations) and was chosen as a bridge between in vitro and anticipated clinical studies. the commercial elisa does not distinguish endogenous
(wild-type) il-2 from the analogs used in this study. to ensure
that il-2 measured in the supernatants of the cultured pbmcs
was of endogenous origin, cells were washed three times with
pbs after stimulation for 1 h with  xxxg1173xxx  or bay 50-4798
and replated in fresh aim medium. after 24 h, supernatants
were collected and evaluated for endogenous il-2 production
using a sandwich elisa (r&d systems, minneapolis, mn).

rna extraction
total rna was extracted from pbmcs using trizol reagent
(gibco-brl) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

isolation of pbmcs for cytokine studies

reverse transcription of total rna

pbmcs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation of
whole blood from healthy male donors (age 28–45 years).
within 1 h of collection into 50-ml falcon tubes containing
sodium heparin, blood was diluted with one volume of phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) (gibco-brl). diluted blood was
layered over  xxxd3253xxx -paque (1.077 density) (amersham bio-

reverse transcription (rt) was carried out with 62.5 u multiscribe reverse transcriptase, 5.5 mm mgcl2, 10 mm tris-hcl,
ph 8.3, 50 mm kcl, 1.25 m oligo-dt, 0.4 u/l rnase inhibitor (geneamp rna pcr kit), 1 mm dntps (all from applied biosystems, foster city, ca), and 500 ng rna. the final volume was adjusted to 50 l with rnase-free water. the

novel il-2 analog and reduced secondary cytokine profile
pcr program for rt was 10 min at 25°c, 30 min at 48°c, 5
min at 95°c, then held at 4°c. freshly prepared cdna samples were quality controlled using the  xxxg1075xxx  housekeeping gene
in an rt–pcr. cdna was stored at 20°c for additional analysis.

cloning of il-2 gene
the human il-2 cdna was cloned from human pbmcs
stimulated for 4 h with  xxxd2620xxx  (cona). the sequence
was confirmed to match accession no. x01589.

real-time quantitative taqman pcr
pcrs were carried out in a final volume of 25 l containing taqman universal pcr master mix (10 mm tris-hcl, ph
8.3, 50 mm kcl, 5 mm mgcl2), 2.5 mm deoxyribonucleotide
triphosphates, 0.625 u amplitaq gold dna polymerase, 0.25
u amperase ung, 80 nm taqman probe (all from applied
biosystems), 40 ng cdna, and 400 nm of each primer. four
technical replicates of each sample were assayed in 96-well
plates and amplified in an automated fluorometer (abi prism
7700 sequence detection system, applied biosystems), which
uses the 5-nuclease activity of taq-dna polymerase to generate a real-time quantitative dna analysis assay. amplification conditions were 2 min at 50°c, 10 min at 95°c to activate
the amplitaq gold dna polymerase, 40 cycles of 15 sec at
95°c, and 1 min at 60°c. the comparative threshold cycle (ct)
method was used to quantify individual mrna levels (il-2)
relative to -actin. normalized ratios were then used to calculate experimental variation relative to the zero time point (0 h)
within each donor sample set.

pg/ml), il-12p70 (9 pg/ml), il-13 (2 pg/ml), tnf- (8
pg/ml), ifn- (24 pg/ml), gm-csf (4 pg/ml), according to
upstate biotechnology and confirmed in our studies. cytokine
concentrations were calculated using the masterplex qt software, version 1.2 (miraibio, inc. alameda, ca). values lower
than the sensitivity of the assay were arbitrarily assigned a value
equivalent to the lower limit of detection. values exceeding the
dynamic range of the assay were assigned a value of 9 ng/ml.

statistical analysis
natural logarithms of the raw values were used for the analysis. analysis of variance (anova) linear models were used
for each cytokine to test the null hypothesis of no drug effect
at each time point. the dependent variable was the natural logarithm of the value, and the independent variables were time,
drug, subject, time by drug interaction, and subject by time interaction. to account for the between-subject variation, a random effect model was fitted in which subject and subject by
time interaction were considered random effects, and the other
independent variables were considered fixed effects. from this

male donors were evaluated. culture supernatants were collected at the indicated times and stored at 70°c until evaluation for cytokine content using luminex fluorescent-based
technology with the beadlyte human multi-cytokine flex kit
(12-plex) (upstate biotech, waltham, ma) according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. triplicate 25-l supernatant
samples and 25 l diluted bead mixture per well were added
to a filter-bottom microplate. standard curves, based on a fiveparameter fit, were generated using duplicate 25-l samples
of 2-fold dilutions of a cocktail containing 9 ng/ml of 12 different cytokines. after overnight incubation at 4°c, microplate
wells were washed, and the remaining liquid was aspirated; 25
l diluted biotinylated detection antibody mixture was added
to each well and incubated for another hour at ambient temperature. microplate wells were washed again and aspirated,
and 100 l of phycoerythrin (pe)-conjugated streptavidin (bd
pharmingen, san diego, ca) diluted 100-fold in pbs/10%
bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) was added to each well and incubated for 30 min. microplates were read on the luminex 100
instrument (luminex, austin, tx). the sensitivity of the assay
for the various cytokines was: il-1 (6 pg/ml), il-4 (2 pg/ml),
 xxxg1180xxx  (2 pg/ml), il-6 (7 pg/ml), il-8 (1 pg/ml), il-10 (1

results
comparing biologic activity of bay 50-4798
and  xxxg1173xxx 
bay 50-4798 and  xxxg1173xxx  were equally potent on their
shared target, as demonstrated by similar proliferative dose-response curves of activated t cells (fig. 1). in contrast, nk cells
failed to proliferate to bay 50-4798 at concentrations eliciting
peak responses to  xxxg1173xxx  and required approximately 1000fold higher concentrations of bay 50-4798 than  xxxg1173xxx 
for half-maximal responses. thus, although bay 50-4798 retains full potency on activated t cells, its selectivity for this
target over nk cells is far greater compared with  xxxg1173xxx .

carried out on rna isolated at the indicated times. graph shows

induction of endogenous il-2
endogenous il-2 was detected in the  xxxg1173xxx -treated cultures of all 10 donors tested, compared with 9 of 10 donors tested
after culture with bay 50-4798 (fig. 2). on average, endogenous il-2 production was 4.8-fold lower in cultures stimulated
with bay 50-4798, compared with  xxxg1173xxx -stimulated cultures (p  0.001). significant donor-to-donor variability was evident in the absolute amount of endogenous il-2 detected. however, the relative amount of endogenous il-2 measured from
pbmcs from most donors was lower (range 0–606 pg/ml) after culture with bay 50-4798 than with  xxxg1173xxx  (range
143–1480 pg/ml).

quantitative analysis of il-2 mrna
the endogenous origin of il-2 was confirmed by detection
of upregulation of its mrna in cultured pbmcs from a subset of 6 donors (fig. 3). the kinetic response to both cytokines
was similar, with peak relative mrna levels observed at 6 h.

in serum-free aim medium in a round-bottom 96-well plate,
washed thoroughly, and recultured in fresh medium. after 24

pbmcs from all 6 donors evaluated produced il-6 in response to  xxxg1173xxx , increasing with time (fig. 4) and concentration of the exogenous cytokine (data not shown). five of
six donors produced tnf- and ifn-. although sds indicated substantial donor-to-donor variability, there was a statistically significant reduction after 48 h in the mean concentrations of tnf-, il-6, and ifn- produced in response to bay
50-4798 compared with  xxxg1173xxx . four of six donors produced low levels of il-1. there was a trend toward reduced
levels in response to bay 50-4798 compared with  xxxg1173xxx ;
however, this did not reach statistical significance.
comparison of bay 50-4798 and  xxxg1173xxx  was further
extended to investigate effects on a panel of secondary cytokines, including il-4,  xxxg1180xxx , il-8, il-10, il-12, il-13, and gm-

tivated t cells expressing the high-affinity human  xxxg1175xxx .21 we used those two preparations for further investigation
of the cytokine pattern of bay 50-4798 in contrast to aldeseleukin.
this study demonstrates that both  xxxg1173xxx  and bay 504798 can induce production of endogenous il-2, but this production is significantly lower for bay 50-4798. other investigators have also reported that exogenous il-2 can stimulate
transcription of its own gene but have not determined if transcription causes production of biologically relevant levels of
the protein.28 peest et al. 29 reported what they believed to be
endogenous il-2 in the serum of cancer patients treated with

evaluated for production of (a) tnf-, (b) il-6, (c) il-1,
and (d) ifn-. the values represent the arithmetic means ò
sem of combined replicates of all donors from two independent experiments. these cytokines were not detected in unstimulated control wells cultured with medium alone (data not
shown). ***p  0.001 (bay 50-4798 vs.  xxxg1173xxx ).

csf. low levels of il-12 and il-4 were produced by pbmcs
from 2 and 5 of 6 donors, respectively; these were not statistically significantly different in response to  xxxg1173xxx  or bay
50-4798 (data not shown).  xxxg1173xxx  induced detectable levels of  xxxg1180xxx , il-8, il-10, il-13, and gm-csf in pbmc cultures
from all 6 donors. compared with  xxxg1173xxx , bay 50-4798
induced statistically significant reductions in mean levels of
these cytokines evident after 6 h (fig. 5), although there was
again substantial donor-to-donor variability to both stimuli.
this variability could not be explained by differences in basal
expression levels of the three receptor subunits ( xxxg1175xxx ,
 xxxg1175xxx ,  xxxg1173xxx -r), as taqman studies indicated that these levels were similar for all donors (data not shown).

discussion
in addition to our previous studies, we show that bay 504798 and  xxxg1173xxx  are comparable in biologic activity on ac-

fig. 5. bay 50-4798 leads to general reduction in secondary
cytokines. production of (a)  xxxg1180xxx , (b) il-8, (c) il-10, (d)
il-13, and (e) gm-csf was measured in the cultures as
described in figure 4. the graphs for bay 50-4798 and
 xxxg1173xxx  responses represent the arithmetic means  sem of
combined replicates of all donors from two independent experiments. spontaneous cytokine induction in unstimulated control
cultures (x) with cells from 2 donors was seen only for il-8.

low-dose il-2, but their assay did not allow discrimination between endogenous and exogenously administered cytokine. we
believe the approach adopted in our study is the first definitive
demonstration that secretion of il-2 can be induced solely by
triggering its own receptors. as the commercial elisa for
il-2 does not allow differentiation of endogenous il-2 from
 xxxg1173xxx  and bay 50-4798, the culture conditions in the current study were designed to provide a high level of confidence
that cytokine measured in the supernatants was of endogenous
origin. hara et al.32 calculated that the half-life of receptor-mediated il-2 internalization in pha-stimulated human t cells
was approximately 17 min.32 therefore, it is unlikely that the
cytokine measured in our experiments represents exogenous cytokine transiently bound to il-2 receptors and later released into
the supernatant. furthermore, we confirmed the endogenous
origin of the cytokine measured by demonstrating that the gene
encoding it was activated in these cultures.
although the amount of endogenous il-2 protein measured
was approximately 80% lower in response to bay 50-4798
compared with  xxxg1173xxx , we found no statistically significant
difference in the level of il-2 mrna transcribed after stimulation with either analog. this incongruous result may be accounted for by instability of il-2 mrna, such as that reported
for human t cells stimulated through the t cell receptor (tcr)
in the absence of costimulation.33 if autocrine stimulation of
il-2 also leads to unstable transcripts, this could account for
the absence of il-2 message reported by heaton et al.,34 who
used classic rt-pcr to examine the il-2 message in pbmcs
after 24 and 72 h of culture with wild-type il-2 and its analogs.
even using a more sensitive pcr methodology, we found peak
levels of il-2 mrna after 6 h of culture and only minimal levels by 24 h. further studies are necessary to determine if differences in stability of il-2 mrna transcribed in response to
the bay 50-4798 and  xxxg1173xxx  account for the current findings.
because the concentrations needed to saturate high-affinity
and intermediate-affinity il-2 receptors are approximately
25–100 pm (0.4–1.5 ng/ml) and approximately 5–10 nm
(75–150 ng/ml), respectively,35,36 the low levels of endogenous il-2 induced in vitro by bay 50-4798 would not be expected to affect cells expressing either form of the receptor.
therefore, it is unlikely that the selectivity of bay 50-4798
would be compromised on in vivo administration.
il-2 induces ifn- and tnf-,37,38 both of which have been
implicated in systemic toxicity.39,40 furthermore, tnf- can act
as a mediator of apoptosis in mature t lymphocytes.41,42 we,
therefore, propose that an il-2 analog that elicits reduced levels of these cytokines might be therapeutically attractive because
of its potential for reduced toxicity and apoptotic activity.
theoretically, even an il-2 analog selective for the highaffinity  xxxg1175xxx  could directly elicit production of ifn-
and tnf-, as these cytokines are produced by nk cells,17,19,43
5%–10% of which express high-affinity il-2 receptors.44,45
these cytokines can stimulate further production of tnf- as
well as  xxxd2738xxx  by cells of the macrophage/monocyte lineage.46–50 that said, we believe the use of unseparated pbmcs
in the current study promotes the intercellular interactions that
facilitate induction of this cytokine cascade. even under these
conditions, bay 50-4798 elicits markedly reduced levels of
these cytokines compared with  xxxg1173xxx .

steppan et al.
using the n88r mutein in the form of an antibody fusion
protein, hu et al.51 also reported reduced induction of il-1,
ifn-, and tnf- compared with levels elicited by a fusion
protein incorporating wild-type il-2.51 in addition to these cytokines, we found that bay 50-4798 elicits reduced levels of
several other cytokines known to be induced by il-2.52 combined with similar findings using pbmcs from hiv-infected
patients from recent studies by matthews et al.,53 these results
suggest that diminished secondary cytokine induction is a feature of bay 50-4798 relevant for both normal and compromised immune systems.
in summary, this study shows that bay 50-4798 induces
markedly lower production of inflammatory cytokines than
 xxxg1173xxx . the selectivity of this novel il-2 analog for cells
expressing the high-affinity  xxxg1175xxx , rather than cells that
release these inflammatory cytokines, may explain the favorable tolerability profile of bay 50-4798 seen in preclinical
studies (e.n. chung, p. lum, j. gibbons, m. boes, l. neyer,
and l. tseng, unpublished observations). in addition, this study
indicates that the superior tolerability of bay 50-4798 compared with  xxxg1173xxx  is unlikely to be compromised by stimulation of t cells that produce endogenous il-2.
our previous studies showing that transient increases in
cd4 t cells are similar in chimpanzees treated with bay 504798 or aldesleukin21 support the view that the diminished secondary cytokine induction by bay 50-4798 represents a selective loss of function rather than a generalized reduction in
immunologic potency and suggest that bay 50-4798 may provide a significant step forward in the development of immunebased therapies.
