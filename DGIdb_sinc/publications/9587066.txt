introduction
the term bartter’s syndrome comprises a spectrum of
hereditary renal tubular disorders characterized by
chronic hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. in 1962
bartter and colleagues reported on two patients who presented with hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and normal blood pressure despite
of hyperaldosteronism [1]. histology of the kidneys revealed hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in
both patients. in the following years numerous studies
described a variety of additional clinical and biochemical
anomalies which occur in association with hypokalemic
metabolic alkalosis [2–4]. the variety of additional findings led to a classification into at least three phenotypically different hypokalemic tubulopathies which have
been referred to as different variants of bartter’s syndrome: (a) gitelman’s syndrome, or familial hypokalemia-hypomagnesemia syndrome, (b) hyperprostaglandin
e syndrome (antenatal bartter’s syndrome), and (c) socalled classic bartter’s syndrome [5–7]. the various hypokalemic tubulopathies have been reported to be familial, and the inheritance pattern is most consistent with
autosomal recessive transmission [8, 9]. on the pathophysiological level many alterations have been identified, but despite extensive investigations the pathogenesis of the various disorders remained uncertain [5, 10].
advances of molecular biology offered a new pathway to
elucidate the molecular basis of these diseases. several
genes had been cloned whose products are involved in
renal electrolyte homeostasis. based on preexisting information from pathophysiological studies these genes
were thought to be candidates for the different hypokalemic tubulopathies. this review describes the molecular
genetic approach that was successfully used to localize
and identify genes involved in various phenotypes of
bartter’s syndrome.

phenotypic variability of “bartter’s syndrome”
gitelman’s syndrome
in 1966 gitelman and colleagues reported on three patients with hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis associated
with hypomagnesemia and impaired renal conservation
of magnesium and potassium [2]. this disorder subsequently designated as gitelman’s syndrome, or familial
hypokalemia-hypomagnesemia syndrome, is inherited as
an autosomal recessive trait, although genetic heterogeneity with autosomal dominant transmission in a subset
of families has been discussed [8, 11]. the prevalence of
the disease is estimated to be 1:50,000 [12].
gitelman’s syndrome has frequently been referred to
as a variant of bartter’s syndrome since laboratory features including hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, hyperreninism and hyperaldosteronism are the same as those
described in bartter’s original report [11, 13]. gitelman’s
syndrome patients, however, can be discriminated from

those with classic bartter’s syndrome and hyperprostaglandin e syndrome by permanently decreased serum
magnesium levels and characteristic hypocalciuria [2,
14]. typically the renal concentrating capacity is normal
or slightly diminished in patients with gitelman’s syndrome [13, 14]. urinary excretion of  xxxd1903xxx 
has been reported to be within the normal range, and
prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors seem to be of limited
benefit in these patients [13, 15]. the clinical course of
gitelman’s syndrome is relatively mild, with a disease
onset from childhood to juvenile age or even later. patients may be completely asymptomatic, and diagnosis is
sometimes made when serum electrolytes are measured
[11, 13]. clinical findings include occasional episodes of
muscle weakness, tetany, carpopedal spasms, paresthesia, chronic dermatitis, and short stature [2, 11, 13, 14].
gitelman’s syndrome appears to have a benign prognosis
with respect to renal function [13].
hyperprostaglandin e syndrome
(antenatal bartter’s syndrome)
hyperprostaglandin e syndrome is the most severe form
of the autosomal recessive hypokalemic tubulopathies.
the prevalence of this disease is estimated to be about
1:50,000–1:100,000 [9, 16]. affected individuals exhibit
hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis and hyperrenemic hyperaldosteronism but normotensive blood pressure, thus
resembling the patients in bartter’s original report. characteristic additional features include hypercalciuria and
isosthenuria [3, 17–19]. based on the findings of increased renal and systemic  xxxd1903xxx  synthesis
and the effective treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors the term hyperprostaglandin e syndrome was introduced to describe this syndrome [7, 18, 20]. the disorder
typically manifests itself in utero with marked fetal polyuria, leading to polyhydramnios between the 22th and
30th week of gestation, premature labor, and preterm delivery [3, 21]. the neonatal period is characterized by severe renal loss of salt and water [3, 7, 21, 22]. during the
first weeks or months of life most infants develop nephrocalcinosis [3, 16, 23]. further clinical features include
polyuria, polydipsia, and recurrent episodes of fever and
vomiting, and patients often fail to thrive [5, 7, 24]. recently, sensoneurinal deafness has been reported in patients with hyperprostaglandin e syndrome [9, 25]. our
own observations indicate that sensoneurinal hearing impairment may be as frequent as 10% in patients with this
disorder (károlyi and seyberth, unpublished data).
classic bartter’s syndrome
among the hypokalemic tubulopathies classic bartter’s
syndrome is the most heterogeneous and least defined
disorder. typically the diagnosis of classic bartter’s syndrome is considered when criteria for gitelman’s syndrome or hyperprostaglandin e syndrome are not ful-

319

filled [6, 7]. some patients exhibit only the core features
of bartter’s original description, with chronic hypokalemic alkalosis, hyperrenemic hyperaldosteronism but normal blood pressure [1]. serum magnesium concentrations are normal but may be intermittently slightly diminished. nephrocalcinosis is an uncommon finding,
and investigation of renal concentrating ability shows no
gross abnormality [6]. in other patients precise clinical
diagnosis may be difficult because of additional features
overlapping the different tubulopathies.
the clinical course of patients with classic bartter’s
syndrome is relatively benign with respect to renal electrolyte loss and volume depletion. patients can be completely asymptomatic or present with muscular weakness, fatigue, or growth retardation [6]. in most cases the
diagnosis is not made before school age or adolescence.
the prevalence of classic bartter’s syndrome is unknown, and inheritance pattern best fits with autosomal
recessive transmission.

pathophysiology and candidate genes
numerous studies have identified a variety of abnormalities at the pathophysiological level in the different hypokalemic tubulopathies, but clearly different pathomechanisms could not be identified [5, 10]. several patterns of
aberrant renal ion transport have been described which
suggested a defect of  xxxd3213xxx  reabsorption in
either the ascending limb of the loop of henle [26, 27],
the proximal [28] or early distal [29] tubule, or the cortical
collecting duct [30]. other studies report normal urinary
chloride excretion and abnormal renal potassium handling
to be the more prominent feature [10, 17, 23]. thus information on the pathophysiology of these disorders suggested several genes which had been cloned in humans or
other mammalian species as candidates for molecular
studies. these candidate genes included genes coding for
sodium, chloride or potassium channels expressed in kidney, as well as members of the electroneutral renal sodium-(potassium)-chloride cotransporter family [31, 32].
the pathogenetic role of prostaglandins in hypokalemic tubulopathies has been much debated [27, 33, 34].
excessive renal and systemic synthesis of prostaglandin
e2 has been well documented in patients with hyperprostaglandin e syndrome [4, 20]. prostaglandins are known
to inhibit  xxxd3213xxx  reabsorption in the thick ascending limb and inhibit renal concentrating ability [35,
36]. therefore the candidate genes also included genes
whose products are involved in prostaglandin metabolism. vascular hyporesponsiveness to the pressure activity of angiotensin has been described in various patients
[3, 19]. therefore the gene encoding the  xxxg99xxx 
type i receptor was screened for mutations in five patients diagnosed as having bartter’s syndrome [37]. in
one of these patients a sequence abnormality was found
that predicted a single amino acid substitution in the angiotensin receptor, but the study could not demonstrate
that this sequence variant was disease related [37].

mutations in the  xxxg2080xxx  gene
causing gitelman’s syndrome
typical features of autosomal recessive gitelman’s syndrome resemble the state induced by administration of
thiazide diuretics [38]. in consequence it was hypothesized that the defect in gitelman’s syndrome affects a
similar region of the cortical distal tubule as that affected
by thiazides [38, 39]. from rat kidney and flounder urinary bladder cdnas encoding an absorptive  xxxg2080xxx  ( xxxg2080xxx ) had been
cloned [32, 40]. in rats  xxxg2080xxx  is expressed in the renal
cortex, consistent with localization in apical cell membranes in the distal convoluted tubule [32]. to test this cotransporter as a candidate for gitelman’s syndrome the
human  xxxg2080xxx  cdna was cloned, and genomic clones
containing the corresponding gene ( xxxg2080xxx ) were identified [41, 42]. fluorescence in situ hybridization and
linkage analysis in reference families (ceph) with a genetic marker close to the  xxxg2080xxx  gene assigned the human locus to chromosome 16q13 [41, 42]. families affected with gitelman’s syndrome showed significant linkage with microsatellite markers close to this locus [41].
locus homogeneity of gitelman’s syndrome has been
confirmed in subsequent linkage studies, and there is no
evidence for a further gene locus so far [43–45].
the exon-intron organization of the  xxxg2080xxx  gene
has been determined and revealed that the human  xxxg2080xxx 
is encoded in 26 exons. sequence analysis predicted a
cotransporter protein comprising 1,021 amino acids and
containing 12 putative transmembrane domains with
long intracellular amino- and carboxytermini [41, 42]. a
screening for mutations was performed in affected individuals, and various mutations were detected that segregated with the disease phenotype, and that were proven
to be absent in normal controls [41, 46]. these mutations
include base substitutions, altering single amino acids at
residues that are highly conserved among species or affecting the exon-intron splice sites. furthermore, nonsense mutations introducing a premature stop codon as
well as deletions or insertions causing a frameshift were
identified [41, 44, 46, 47] (fig. 1). about 100 different
mutations have been reported so far which are spread
evenly throughout the  xxxg2080xxx  gene. in some kindreds
one of the parents of the index case was found to be affected with gitelman’s syndrome, suggesting an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance [11]. however, molecular analysis of one of these families demonstrated the
respective parent to be compound heterozygous for mutations in the  xxxg2080xxx  gene, while the affected children
were either homozygous or compound heterozygous,
having inherited one mutation from each parent [44, 46].
therefore the inheritance pattern in this family confirms
autosomal recessive inheritance of the disease.
the identification of mutations in  xxxg2080xxx  has demonstrated the molecular basis of gitelman’s syndrome.
frameshift mutations and splice-site mutations lead to a
truncated polypeptide, resulting in an altered or absent

protein product. these mutations are predicted to result
in loss of cotransporter function, leading to impaired reabsorption of  xxxd3213xxx  in the distal convoluted
tubule in patients with gitelman’s syndrome. the effects
of single point mutations on protein function remain to
be investigated in functional tests.

mutations in the  xxxg2078xxx  gene
causing hyperprostaglandin e syndrome
(antenatal bartter’s syndrome)
by analogy to gitelman’s syndrome, a candidate gene
based approach was used to clone a gene responsible for
other hypokalemic tubular disorders [48]. the administration of loop diuretics such as furosemide produces
electrolyte disturbances similar to those seen in patients
with hyperprostaglandin e syndrome, providing evidence
of impairment of a specific tubular function at least in a
subset of these patients [49, 50]. from rat, rabbit, and
mouse kidney an absorptive bumetanide- and furosemide-sensitive sodium potassium 2 chloride cotransporter ( xxxg2078xxx ) had been cloned [32, 51, 52].  xxxg2078xxx  is expressed in apical cell membranes in the thick ascending
limb of the loop of henle [51, 52]. to investigate this cotransporter for its potential role in hypokalemic tubulopathies the homologous human gene ( xxxg2078xxx ) was
cloned [48].
characterization of the exon-intron organization of the
 xxxg2078xxx  gene demonstrated that the human  xxxg2078xxx  is
encoded by 26 exons and predicts a cotransporter protein
of 1,099 amino acid residues with 12 potential membranespanning helices flanked by large cytosolic domains at
the amino- and carboxytermini [48]. the genomic locus
of  xxxg2078xxx  has been assigned to chromosome 15q15q21 [48]. significant genetic linkage with microsatellite
markers from this chromosomal region was shown in a

set of families with hyperprostaglandin e syndrome, providing strong evidence for a defect in the  xxxg2078xxx  gene
in these families [48]. however, linkage analyses also
revealed genetic heterogeneity of this disorder since not
all families showed linkage to this gene locus [53, 54].
affected individuals were screened for mutations in
the  xxxg2078xxx  gene. different mutations were identified
which segregated with the disease phenotype and were
not observed in unaffected controls (fig. 2) [48]. the mutations that were detected include point mutations that alter highly conserved amino acid residues as well as insertions or deletions causing a frameshift [48]. whether specific point mutations result in lost or significantly reduced
cotransporter function has not been investigated in functional studies yet. the frameshift mutations that have
been identified lead to a truncated protein product and
will cause a loss of function of  xxxg2078xxx .
the results of these molecular studies demonstrate
that defects in the  xxxg2078xxx  gene coding for the bumetanide-sensitive  xxxg2078xxx  cause hyperprostaglandin e syndrome. loss of cotransporter function leads to impaired
potassium-coupled reabsorption of  xxxd3213xxx  in
the thick ascending limb of the loop of henle. these
findings are consistent with impaired response to the administration of furosemide, as has been demonstrated in
patients affected with this syndrome [55].

genetic heterogeneity of hyperprostaglandin
e syndrome revealed by mutations in the  xxxg1249xxx  gene
genetic heterogeneity of hyperprostaglandin e syndrome
(antenatal bartter’s syndrome) had been demonstrated by
linkage analyses in affected families, providing evidence
for a further gene in which defects may cause this disease
[53, 54].  xxxd3213xxx  reabsorption in the thick ascending limb via the  xxxg2078xxx  depends on adequate supply
of luminal potassium. the atp-regulated inwardly rectifying  xxxg1232xxx   xxxg1249xxx  (kir 1.1) recycles the
potassium entering the cells via the  xxxg2078xxx  back to the
tubule lumen and is therefore essential for the function of
this cotransporter [56]. therefore the gene encoding this

syndrome) [48]. circles, mutations&ig.c:/f

 xxxg1232xxx  was a further candidate for hyperprostaglandin e syndrome. from rat and human kidney
 xxxg1249xxx  cdnas had previously been cloned [57–59]. in
humans the  xxxg1249xxx  gene coding for the  xxxg1249xxx  channel
contains five exons which produce five distinct transcripts
[58, 59]. these transcripts predict three  xxxg1249xxx  proteins
which share a core sequence of 372 amino acids encoded
in exon 5 and vary in length from 372 to 391 amino acids
at their nh2-termini [58, 59]. the core structure of the
 xxxg1249xxx  proteins features two transmembrane spanning
domains, a pore-forming domain, and intracelluar aminoand carboxytermini. in rats  xxxg1249xxx  isoforms are differentially expressed in the macula densa and in apical membranes from medullary thick ascending limb to cortical
collecting duct [60, 61]. in distal nephron segments
 xxxg1249xxx  isoforms have been proposed to participate in potassium secretion [60]. in humans no data exist about differential expression of the  xxxg1249xxx  isoforms.
the genomic locus of the  xxxg1249xxx  gene has been localized to human chromosome 11q24-11q25 by fluorescence
in situ hybridization [59, 62]. families with hyperprostaglandin e syndrome in which linkage to the  xxxg2078xxx 
gene had been excluded were typed with microsatellite
markers spanning the region containing  xxxg1249xxx  [54].
haplotype analysis in these families provided evidence
for a defect in this region in the families studied [54].
this was confirmed by identification of mutations in the
 xxxg1249xxx  gene which were shown to segregate with the disease phenotype and were not found in unaffected controls
[53, 54]. the mutations comprise substitutions of single
bases that either lead to single amino acid substitutions or
introduce a premature stop codon, and deletions or insertions causing a frameshift [53, 54]. the mutations affect
amino acid residues of the transmembrane segments, the
pore-forming domain, the putative atp-binding domain
as well as the amino- and carboxytermini of the  xxxg1249xxx 
channel protein (fig. 3) [53, 54].

all mutations that have been reported so far are located in exon 5 of the  xxxg1249xxx  gene, therefore altering amino
acid residues contained in all predicted isoforms of the
channel. [53, 54]. one of the mutations identified to be
homozygous in a patient with hyperprostaglandin e syndrome causes a substitution of  xxxd2431xxx  for glycine
at position 167 in the second transmembrane segment
[54]. prior in situ mutagenesis studies had suggested this
amino acid residue to face the channel pore and to be essential for its geometrical structure [63]. the observed
mutation implies that it alters the channel pore and eliminates the channel function [54]. other mutations introduced in rat  xxxg1249xxx  cdna and expressed in cos-7 cells
have been demonstrated to abolish or significantly impair
electrophysiological properties of the channel protein
[64]. loss of function of the  xxxg1249xxx  channel prevents recycling of potassium across the apical membrane from
cells back into the tubule lumen. in the thick ascending

limb inadequate supply with intraluminal potassium inhibits the activity of the  xxxg2078xxx , resulting in defective

this nephron segment and renal salt wasting.
initial clinical data suggest that patients with hyperprostaglandin e syndrome and a defect in  xxxg1249xxx  have
milder hypokalemia than patients with a defect in
 xxxg2078xxx  [53, 64]. this could be explained by assuming
that inhibition of potassium secretion in distal nephron
segments via  xxxg1249xxx  causes a less severe potassium loss,
or that potassium recycling in the thick ascending limb is
partially maintained by other potassium channels [64,
65]. however, not in all patients with hyperprostaglandin
e syndrome have defects in either the  xxxg2078xxx  or the
 xxxg1249xxx   xxxg1232xxx  been identified, indicating
that there may exist further mechanisms involved in the
pathogenesis of this disorder [53, 54, 66].

sionally low serum magnesium levels, and a relatively
mild clinical course may resemble the phenotype of gitelman’s syndrome. however, on the molecular level
classic bartter’s syndrome has been shown to be genetically distinct from gitelman’s syndrome by linkage analyses in affected families [43]. mutations in the chloride
channel gene clcnkb have recently been demonstrated
in patients with hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis and hyper- or normocalciuria without nephrocalcinosis [66]; serum magnesium levels were reported to be normal. unfortunately, this article provided no information on the
antenatal period.
the mutations in these patients comprised large deletions as well as missense and nonsense mutations in
clcnkb on chromosome 1p36 [66, 68, 69]. these mutations are predicted to significantly impair transport of
reabsorbed chloride from epithelial cells across the basolateral membrane via the chloride channel hclc-kb in
the distal nephron [31, 70].

a third gene for hyperprostaglandin e syndrome
maps to chromosome 1p
conclusions
a third gene for hyperprostaglandin e syndrome has recently been mapped to chromosome 1p32.1-p35 by positional cloning in a large inbred bedouin family [67]. in
this family hyperprostaglandin e syndrome was reported
to be associated with sensoneurinal hearing loss [25].
the association between the two disorders has been proposed to be due to a pleiotropic effect of a single genetic
defect or coincidental inheritance of two disease genes at
this locus [25]. this hypothesis requires further investigation since no candidate gene in this chromosomal region has been identified so far. furthermore, future studies must evaluate whether this gene locus accounts for
hyperprostaglandin e syndrome in patients who are
thought to have a defect in neither the  xxxg2078xxx  nor the
 xxxg1249xxx  gene [53, 54].

mutations in the clcnkb gene causing
classic bartter’s syndrome
laboratory features of patients with classic bartter’s syndrome including hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, occa-

appplication of molecular genetics to inherited hypokalemic tubulopathies has led within 2 years to the identification of genetic defects underlying the pathogenesis in
different forms of bartter’s syndrome (table 1). gitelman’s syndrome results from mutations in the  xxxg2080xxx 
gene encoding the human thiazide-sensitive  xxxg2080xxx , leading to impaired reabsorption of  xxxd3213xxx  in the
distal convoluted renal tubule. gitelman’s syndrome appears to be a genetically homogeneous disease without
evidence for an additional gene locus. hyperprostaglandin e syndrome has been confirmed to be genetically a
heterogeneous disorder arising from mutations either in
the  xxxg2078xxx  or the  xxxg1249xxx  gene. mutations in  xxxg2078xxx 
coding for the bumetanide-sensitive  xxxg2078xxx  cause defective potassium-coupled reabsorption of  xxxd3213xxx  in the thick ascending limb of henle’s loop. loss of
function mutations in the  xxxg1249xxx  gene disrupt potassium
recycling via the  xxxg1232xxx   xxxg1249xxx  from the
cells back to the tubule lumen and inhibit thereby the
 xxxg2078xxx  activity. a third gene for hyperprostaglandin e
syndrome has been mapped to chromosome 1p, and it re-

323

mains to be evaluated whether this disease can also arise
from defects in other genes involved in the regulation of
renal salt transport.
mutations in the chloride channel gene clcnkb underlie the pathogenesis of classic bartter’s syndrome,
causing defective chloride transport across the basolateral membrane from epithelial cells in the distal tubule.
in the future molecular genetic methods will permit a
precise diagnosis for these disorders and will allow patients to be classified unambiguously. a diagnosis on the
molecular level can be established either by identification of mutations in affected individuals or by genotyping larger families with polymorphic genetic markers
tightly linked to the different genes. for the  xxxg2080xxx 
gene an intragenic tetranucleotide microsatellite marker
is available, making it possible to type families suspected
to have gitelman’s syndrome without restrictions due to
recombination events [46]. the mutations that have been
identified so far suggest that each family has its private
mutation making mutation screening time consuming
and labor intensive. new mutation detection techniques
may help to overcome this problem in the future [71].
the desirability of performing prenatal diagnostics by
molecular methods in hyperprostaglandin e syndrome,
for example, with regard to intrauterine treatment, remains debatable. in this disorder polyhydramnios in affected individuals is a characteristic feature and can be
detected by ultrasonography.
further studies will have to evaluate the contribution
of additional genetic factors to associated findings such
as sensoneurinal hearing loss. hearing loss in patients
with hyperprostaglandin e syndrome has been thought to
be due to a to a pleiotropic effect of a genetic defect or
coincidence of two genetic defects [25]. however, it remains unclear whether this complication is a consequence of preterm delivery, or whether it results from episodes of severe electrolyte imbalance and massive dehydratation.
