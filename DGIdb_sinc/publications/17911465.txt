abstract: initially used for the treatment of immunodeficiencies, intravenous immunoglobulins (ivig) have increasingly been used as immunomodulatory agents in autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.
the mode of action of ivig is enigmatic, probably involving fc-dependent
and/or f(ab )2-dependent nonexclusive mechanisms of action. ivig
broadly interacts with the different components of the immune system:
cytokines, complement, fc receptors, and several cell surface immunocompetent molecules. ivig has also an impact on effector functions of
immune cells. these mechanisms of action of ivig reflect the importance of natural antibodies in the maintenance of immune homeostasis.
we discuss here the recent advances in the understanding of immunoregulatory effects of ivig, and we pointed out the need for new strategies to
overcome the predicted increasing worldwide shortage of ivig.

introduction: what are intravenous
immunoglobulins?
intravenous immunoglobulins (ivig) are a blood-derived product prepared
from pools of plasma of at least 3,000 and up to 100,000 healthy blood donors.
clinical preparations of ivig consist of intact igg with a distribution of igg
subclasses corresponding to that of normal human serum and probably contain
a sampling from the entire repertoire of antigen-combining variable regions of
antibodies that would be present in normal serum.1,2

use of ivig in human diseases: a non-exhaustive list
clinical indications for ivig include immune replacement and immune modulation. for replacement therapy, ivig is used in patients with primary and
selected secondary immunodeficiencies characterized by absent or deficient
antibody production. these indications include, for example, hypogammaglobulinemia, b cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute graft-versus-host
disease (gvhd) after bone marrow transplantation, children with hiv, and
wiskott–aldrich syndrome. concerning inflammatory disorders, ivig is currently used to prevent coronary artery aneurysms in kawasaki disease (kd),
in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (itp), and guillain–barré syndrome.
ivig has been used in many other diseases, rare or common, especially in
neurologic, dermatologic, or infection-related diseases.3–6

immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory
effects of ivig
the mode of action of ivig is complex, probably involving fc-dependent
and/or f(ab )2-dependent nonexclusive mechanisms of action. ivig broadly
interacts with the different components of the immune system: cytokines,
complement, fc receptors, and several cell surface immunocompetent
molecules.1,7 furthermore, ivig has a marked impact on different effector
cells of the immune system (b and t lymphocytes, dendritic cells, etc.) and
regulates a wide range of genes.8,9
the fc region of ivig: a role in immunomodulatory effects of ivig
independent of the antigen-specific effects, ivig has well-recognized antiinflammatory effects attributed to the interactions between the igg fc domain
and fc r. in immune thrombocytopenia (itp), an autoimmune disease characterized by platelet clearance mediated by pathogenic anti-platelet autoantibodies, ivig probably induces a blockade of fc r expressed on monocytes or

sibéril et al.

499

macrophages implicated in the phagocytosis or the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (adcc) of the autoantibody-coated platelets.10,11 in addition
to fc r saturation, ivig might also modulate their expression in mice and
humans.12–14 fc-dependent immunomodulation by ivig may also involve secondary cellular events. thus, the simultaneous ligation of inhibitory fc riib
with the bcr idiotype may inhibit b cell activation and induce anergy and/or
apoptosis through itim motif phosphorylation. the latter mechanism may
provide a basis for ivig-mediated suppression of autoantibody production.
however, a role for both activating and inhibitory fc r in the control of itp
has been recently reported.15 it has been shown that the transfer of ivig-primed
 xxxg1208xxx + dendritic cells drives the amelioration of itp through the engagement
of activating fc r expressed on dendritic cells by ivig as a first event,15 suggesting that itam-bearing receptors are also involved in the inhibition of immune responses.16 in agreement with this hypothesis, a recent study has shown
that ivig induces an fc riii (activating fc r)-dependent inhibition of ifn
signaling through the suppression of expression of the  xxxg1143xxx  subunit of the
ifn receptor.17
an additional fc-dependent mechanism of action of ivig recently documented is the saturation of the neonatal fcr (fcrn) by ivig, resulting in the
accelerated clearance of circulating pathogenic antibodies.18

the other side of the ig molecule: immunomodulatory role of
anti-idiotypic antibodies present in ivig
ivig contains anti-idiotypes against a number of disease-associated autoantibodies.19 anti-idiotypes in ivig may be able to neutralize pathogenic autoantibodies, whereas ivig does not contain antibodies against common immunoglobulins allotypes. interactions between ivig and idiotypes of antigen
receptors on b cells provide the basis for the ability of ivig to regulate autoreactive b cell clones in vivo.20 in fact, a downregulation of specific autoreactive
b cells has been demonstrated in a model where  xxxg1176xxx  mice were adoptively transferred with lymphoid cells from patients
with autoimmune disease and treated with ivig.21,22 reduction in the titer of
autoantibodies has also been observed in several conditions in vivo following
ivig therapy.23,24 ivig has been shown to directly bind to igg and igm fab
fragment cloned by phage display from patients with autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.25–27 sequence analysis has revealed that the most frequently
used germline gene segments of all ivig-bound fabs were identical to those
observed for many other autoantibodies and also represent the most frequently
rearranged vh genes among human b cells. this study suggests that antiidiotypic interactions may have an important role for the development and the
control of the b cell repertoire.

modulation of the cytokine network by ivig
modulation of cytokine antagonists and production by ivig is a major
mechanism by which immunoglobulin exerts its anti-inflammatory effects
in vivo.28 ivig was shown to selectively trigger the production of interleukin1 receptor antagonist ( xxxg1172xxx ), the natural antagonist of il-1, in cultures of
purified monocytes, without concomitant effect on the pro-inflammatory cytokines il-1, il-1, il-6, and  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)- production.29,30
circulating levels of il-1 decrease after treatment with ivig of patients with
the guillain–barré syndrome.31 ivig infusions in patients with kawasaki disease reduce the production of the proinflammatory cytokines il-6, il-8, and
tnf-.32 the anti-inflammatory effects of ivig are also largely dependent on
the ability of ivig to modulate t helper 1 (th1) and th2 cytokine production.
interactions of ivig with the effectors of the complement system
ivig can act by preventing the complement membrane attack complex
(mac) ( xxxg285xxx -9) generation and the subsequent complement-mediated tissue
damage, by scavenging active complement components and diverting complement attack from cellular targets. ivig binds the activated components  xxxg282xxx  and
 xxxg284xxx  in a c1q-independent and c1q-dependent fashion, thus preventing the deposition of these fragments on target surfaces of complement activation.33,34 in
addition, natural anti- xxxg282xxx  autoantibodies, which inhibited  xxxg282xxx  convertase activity in vitro, have been identified.35 both potential anticomplement mechanisms
might play a role in the ivig treatment of patients with dermatomyositis.36
antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of ivig
ivig has an inhibitory effect on mitogen-induced t cell in vitro proliferation
and is able to suppress the proliferation of both antigen-dependent and antigenindependent responses.37 some studies have also shown that ivig causes the
arrest of cells at the g0/g1 phase of the cell cycle, and inhibits cell from
entering s-phase.38 recently, the presence in ivig of biologically active antinerve growth factor (ngf) antibodies has been demonstrated. these anti-ngf
antibodies have inhibitory effects on the proliferation and the differentiation
of a neuronal-like cell line.39
the studies on the effect of ivig on apoptosis have revealed intriguing results. ivig blocks fas ( xxxg764xxx ) /fasl-induced keratinocyte apoptosis in vitro.40
furthermore, in patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis, a syndrome in which
keratinocytes expressing fas and fasl undergo massive apoptosis, disease progression was rapidly reversed after ivig therapy.40 in contrast, we and others
have shown that natural anti- xxxg764xxx  igg antibodies purified from ivig preparation can induce apoptosis of different b and t cell lines and primary cells

sibéril et al.

501

in vitro.41,42 it is thus possible that both agonistic and antagonistic anti- xxxg764xxx 
antibodies are present in ivig, the ultimate effect being dependent on the
proportion and collective avidity of these antibodies.
effects of ivig on effector functions of immune cells
ivig reacts with a number of membrane molecules of t cells, b cells, and
dendritic cells.43–51 antibodies directed to such functional molecules of lymphocytes have a role on activation, differentiation, and effector functions of
immune cells. although the mechanisms of action are not yet elucidated, several effects on functions of b cells and dendritic cells (dcs) have been recently
proposed. the role of ivig on human b lymphocytes was studied in culture
assays derived from the cd40 system that allows a long-term expansion of b
lymphocytes in vitro. firstly, ivig was shown to inhibit the proliferation and
the secretion of ige of cd40-activated b lymphocytes purified from tonsils.52
secondly, therapeutic doses of ivig reduce in vitro the expansion of human
cd40-activated peripheral b lymphocytes in the presence of cytokines. the reduced b cell expansion was not due to a diminution of the rate of proliferation,
but was related to the differentiation of a fraction of b cells into nonproliferating igg-secreting b cells.53 we have examined the effects of ivig on
differentiation, maturation, and function of dcs. we have shown that a therapeutic dose of ivig inhibits the differentiation and maturation of dcs in vitro,
and abrogates the capacity of mature dcs to secrete il-12 upon activation,
while enhancing il-10 production. ivig-induced downregulation of costimulatory molecules associated with modulation of cytokine secretion resulted
in inhibition of auto- and alloreactive t cell activation and proliferation.54 we
have further observed that ivig interferes with the differentiation of dcs from
sle patients, which was associated with an inhibited expression of hla and
 xxxg396xxx / xxxg398xxx  on dcs.55 given the critical role of hla molecules and costimulatory signals delivered by  xxxg396xxx  and  xxxg398xxx  for optimal antigen presentation
and t cell activation, the inhibition of expression of these molecules by ivig
offers a plausible explanation for the efficacy of ivig in sle and other immunoinflammatory conditions.

ivig in immunodeficiencies: more than mere
transfer of antibodies?
ivig is also widely used in supportive therapy of immunodeficient patients.
the plasma igg level reached in immunodeficient patients immediately following infusion of ivig when administered as a “replacement therapy” is 12–14
mg/ml as opposed to 25–35 mg/ml when administered as a “high-dose” immunomodulatory agent in autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. we have

502

annals of the new york academy of sciences

recently studied the effect of “replacement dose” of ivig on the biology of dcs
from patients with immune deficiencies. we examined the status of dcs in
patients with x-linked agammaglobulinemia (xla), a disease characterized
by paucity of b cells and of circulating antibodies. in these patients, where
the differentiation of monocyte-derived dcs is severely impaired, physiological concentrations of cd40-reactive natural antibodies (nabs), purified from
ivig, restore normal phenotypes. moreover, the maturation process induced
by cd40-reactive nabs was accompanied by increased il-10 and decreased
il-12 production and activation of the camp-response element-binding protein ( xxxg515xxx ) pathway.51 these results suggest that b cells promote dc development at least in part through nabs and that interactions between dcs
and nabs may play role in the dc maturation.
common variable immunodeficiency (cvid) is a heterogeneous disorder
associated with low serum immunoglobulin concentrations, defective specific
antibody production, and an increased susceptibility to bacterial infections of
the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.56 ivig has been beneficial in preventing recurrent infections in the majority of cvid patients. the exact mechanism of action by which ivig is of benefit in such diseases is complex and
not completely understood. therefore, we investigated the effect of “replacement dose” of ivig by probing differentiation of dcs from cvid patients.
dcs from cvid patients exhibited defective differentiation, as described previously.57 however, dcs differentiated in the presence of ivig, presented with
an upregulated expression of  xxxg376xxx  (marker of differentiated dcs) and costimulatory molecules  xxxg396xxx ,  xxxg398xxx , and cd40 (molecules critical in dc–t cell
cross-talk) as compared to dcs in the presence of autologous plasma alone.58
thus, contrary to its inhibitory effect on dcs at “high dose,”55 ivig exerted
an agonistic effect on differentiation of dcs at replacement “low” dose.

conclusions: the future of ivig?
research concerning the mechanisms of action of ivig appears to be imperative, not only for improving the broad range of clinical applications and
its therapeutic efficacy, but also for resolving the alarming issue of shortage
of ivig as discussed recently.59 in addition to its increasing use in randomized trials approved by the fda, ivig is also used in an off-label manner for
nearly 100 conditions. indeed, it will be important to design new strategies
to overcome the predicted increasing worldwide shortage of ivig: clinical trials combining mabs with ivig therapy;60 use of igm fractions of plasma as
an alternative source of immunoglobulins for certain indications, particularly
autoimmune diseases;22,61 and use of ivig-free substitute through the ex vivo
formation of immune complexes containing ivig and ivig/mab anti-human
igg.62
further studies should examine the impact of engineering ivig in the optimization of its clinical efficacy. a strategy to reduce the dosage and the

sibéril et al.

503

frequency of ivig infusion could be the enrichment of ivig preparations with
recombinant natural antibodies that have been shown to have a predominant
role in immunomodulatory effects of ivig.1 kaneko et al., have recently reported that anti-inflammatory activity of ivig results from fc sialylation.63
recombinant sialylated fc fragments of igg could, therefore, be an attractive
therapeutic alternative to overcome the shortage of ivig for several autoimmune or inflammatory pathologies.
