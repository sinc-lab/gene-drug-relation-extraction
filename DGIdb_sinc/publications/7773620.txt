molecular determinants of recognition and activation at the
cerebellar benzodiazepine receptor site

abstract-semiempirical
quantum mechanical and molecular mechanics calculations were. carried out to identify and characterize the
steric and electronic properties that modulate ligand recognition and activation of the cerebellar gabajbenzodiazepine
(bdz)
receptor. for this hypothesis development, thiien compounds belonging to structurally diverse chemical families were selected for
study. among the compounds selected were nine that bind and four that do not bind with appreciable affinity to this receptor and some
that are known agonists, antagonists and inverse agonists, as measured by their modulation of gaba (y- xxxd2177xxx ) enhanced
chloride ion flux in cerebellum. the stereoelectronic requirements for recognition deduced from commonalities among the ligands are
the presence of at least two of three hydrogen bonding centers, and a lipophilic aromatic ring, in a specific spatial relationship. the
results suggest that the selectivity for the cerebellar or type i subtype, demonstrated by some of these ligands, could be. failure to meet
the requirements for binding at other receptors because of the absence of one of the proton accepting centers or the larger surface area
and volume of these ligands. the requirement for activation, deduced from comparisons of agonist, antagonist, and  xxxd1422xxx 
properties is the presence of an electron accepting aromatic ring in a specific geometric arrangement with respect to the components of
recognition. the validity of the ‘3d-pharmacophore’ developed was probed by using it for predictions of the behavior of 11 additional
compounds not used for its development.

introduction
the benzodiazepine (bdz) binding site is known to be
localized in the central nervous system (cns) on the
gabaa (y- xxxd2177xxx ) chloride ion channel
receptor.
bdz receptor
ligands
produce
their
pharmacological effects by modulating the gating action of
gaba on the chloride ion channel.’ a large number of
ligands from diverse chemical families have been shown to
bind with high affinity to the benzodiazepine binding
site(s). the bdz ligands have been categorized as
agonists, antagonists, and inverse agonists, based on their
activity in diverse pharmacological endpoints. ligand
labelled agonists are those with similar in vivo activities to
the prototypical 1,4 bdz drugs, such as diazepam,
exhibiting anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, enhanced feeding,
muscle relaxant, and sedative/hypnotic activity. inverse
agonists cause opposite behavioral effects such as
anxiogenesis, proconvulsant, anorectic, and procognitive
actions. antagonists are able to inhibit the action of both
agonists and inverse agonists. 2
based on early receptor binding and thermodynamic
stability studies, two distinct bdz receptor subtypes were
the possibility of many functionally distinct receptor
abbreviations:

subtypes. the techniques of recombinant dna have led
detected that were labeled type i and type ii.3 however,
at present, the entire gabaa/bdz receptor complex is
known to be composed of five membrane spanning
subunits with different subunit combinations resulting in
thus far to the identification of six variants of a subunits
(crl-& four p subunits (plj four y subunits (~t-~ and by),
as well as others labeled 6 and p that have been cloned and
sequenced& several subunit combinations have been
expressed in transfected cell systems and receptor binding
and cl- ion channel function studies have been carried
out4 although these expression studies provide much
useful information, little is known about the subunit
composition and number of functionally distinct central
benzodiazepine receptors (bdzr) in different cns
regions.
recently, our laboratory has reported evidence of at least
three central bdzrs in the spinal cord and one in the
cerebellum. s moreover, evidence from both the molecular
biologysb-d and our own receptor binding studiessa
indicate that the bdzr central site in cerebellum, is most
likely composed of al,  xxxd752xxx , x subunits and are similar to
the bdzr originally labeled type i. while 70 9% of
cortical bdzr display a ‘type i’ bdz receptor
pharmacology, other subtypes are more abundant in the
corpus stratum and spinal cord.6 this lack of regional
subtype localization and the lack of selective ligands
combine to make the pharmacological characterization of
the individual bdzr subtypes and the determination of
ligand requirements for recognition and activation of each,
very demanding and as yet an unresolved problem. the
central cerebellar type i’ bdzr is currently the most
promising candidate for such in depth characterization,
because cerebellum can be used to determine receptor

affinities and activation at this type i site. there are also
type i selective ligands, namely zolpidem and alpidem,
two imidazopyridine ligands,7 and the less selective ici
190,622 and 2-oxoquazepam8 that can be useful in
determining molecular requirements for recognition.
until now, most pharmacophores
developed
for
bdz/gabaa receptor ligands were based on the
assumption of a single receptor site. in previous work in
our laboratory, a model was developed which includes the
minimal requirements for recognition and activation of
non-selective ligands based on a one-site model9 for this
purpose, the steric, electronic and enviromental properties
of fifteen analogs including agonists, inverse agonists, and
antagonists classified according to their anticonvulsant
profile were computed. the pharmacophore proposed
requires as common recognition features, two protonaccepting centers in the ligand separated by -3.5 a. in
addition, the position of a lipophilic center relative to the
proton-accepting sites as defined by the angle between the
three centers was found to be an important discriminant of
activation.
proton accepting sites are a common feature of most
models of bdz pharmacophores reported in the literature.
in a model by codding and muir, one proton accepting site
and one moiety involved in a k--k stacking complex with
the receptor was invoked. lo in another study, fryer et al. , 11
proposed that the type of activity elicited by the bdzr
ligands could be determined by the distance between a
roup and a n: aromatic ring. we have
proton-accepting
shown previously 8 that this hypothesis cannot explain all
bdz ligand activities. tebib and bourguignonl* have
developed a pharmacophore using crystallographic data
and molecular mechanics calculations and found six
‘critical zones’ of the bdzr ligands: four which modify
recognition and two others which modify activation,
including two electron rich zones con-es nding to proton
accepting centers. cook and co-workers p”
3 have developed
pharmacophores based on the assumption that the inverse
agonist/antagonist and agonist bind to different regions of
the same domain. there have been several other models
proposed for receptor recognition, although few of them
address the question of receptor activation and even fewer
propose a site-specific receptor model. l4
in a continued effort to understand the requirements for
recognition and activation at the benzodiazepine receptor
sites, the goal of the present work is to use the techniques
of computational chemistry to identify and characterize the
steric and electronic requirements of ligand recognition
and activation of the cerebellar (type i) site of the bdz
receptor sensitive to both agonists and antagonists. to
provide a self-consistent database for this hypothesis
development, we have used cerebellar receptor binding
data obtained in our laboratory for thirteen ligands from
diverse families. four of these had no significant affinity
for the receptor and were included as controls. in order to
address activation through this receptor, we have measured
the effect of three of these ligands on the gabaa
stimulated chloride ion flux in cerebellar microsacs and
found one to be an agonist, another an antagonist, and the
third an  xxxd1422xxx . this assay provides a direct

measure of the ability of bdz receptor ligands to modulate
the function of the gabaa receptor. such a direct measure
of receptor subtype activity is not presently available for
any other subtype because of receptor heterogeneity in
different brain regions and the lack of selective ligands.
the validity of the pharmacophore developed was probed
by using it to predict the pharmacological behavior of
eleven additional ligands. all the compounds studied are
listed in table 1 and their structures shown in figure 1.
the results obtained allow a refinement of our previous
determinants of recognition and activation to those that are
specific for type i’ receptors.
computational methods and procedures
initial ligand structures were generated interactively using
the chemnote program as implemented in the quanta 3.3
package (polygen corp., waltham, ma). the structures
were then minimized with the charmm force field 2.21s
using an option that ensures planarity of the amide bond.
the steepest descent method was used in minimization
with a convergence of 0.01 kcal/a. charmm minimized
structures were then reoptimized using the semiempirical
quantum mechanical am1 method included in the
mopac v. 5.0 package16 using the precise keyword for
minimization. minima in the conformations of the rotatable
aromatic rings (e.g. ring b of the 1,4 bdzs) and other
substituents (e.g. ester in b-carbolines) were obtained by
nested rotations in 60 o increments using aml. the am1
optimized geometries were used to calculate all
thermodynamic and electronic properties reported.
heats of protonation at competing sites of each analog,
labeled 1, 2,3,4, and 5 in table 2, were calculated as the
difference between the heat of formation of the protonated
and non-protonated form of each ligand. the heat of
protonation was used as a measure of the relative protonaccepting ability at competing sites in the ligand. we and
others have previously used gas phase proton affinities as
an indicator of hydrogen bonding ability of proton
acceptors.17 the smaller the energy, the better the proton
accepting ability at that site. included in this calculation are
all sites that have the possibility of acting as proton
acceptors including cl, no*, cn, and nh groups as well
as the more conventional moieties such as carbonyl, ester
and ether oxygens, and imine nitrogens. the proton
affinities of all lone pairs of electrons were calculated for
each heteroatom as possible proton accepting sites. in each
case, it was found that there was no significant difference
in proton affinities among the different lone pairs centered
on any such moiety.
the energy and electron density of the highest occupied
molecular orbital (homo) and the energy and virtual
electron density in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(lumo) were reported and used as indicators of the ability
of a compound to donate and accept electrons respectively,
as well as to identify the localized ligand sites of such
interactions.
additional electronic properties considered as candidate
modulators of receptor recognition and activation were

polarizabilities, evaluated by an additive scheme using the
parameters proposed by fraga.18
four geometric descri tors were used to characterize the
shape of each ligand. lg for this purpose a van der waals
sphere was placed around each atom, using the radii
reported by gavezzotti. 2o the parameters evaluated were
the surface area, volume, the sterimol parameters l,
defined here as the maximum distance between two atoms
in the molecule, and b 1, the maximum orthogonal distance
that constitutes a cross-section perpendicular to l. each of
these four quantities could be important steric/shape
descriptors in addition to the geometric requirements that
are deduced for the properties found to be important in
specific interactions with the receptor sites. for example,
the maximum length of the compound, l, and the
maximum cioss section perpendicular to it, represented by
bl, could both be important factors in tbe ability of the
ligand to be accommodated in the binding pocket within
the constraints of its maximum dimensions. the total
volume and areas, similarly provide general criteria for
matching the shape of the binding pocket.
the hydrophobicity of the ligands was estimated by an
atom based, conformational-dependent hydrophobic index,

computed using a method recently developed in the
laboratory.21 in this procedure, each atom is assigned a
hydrophobicity index determined from its contribution to
the total van der waals area and its mulliken population
analysis from am1 calculations. the logarithm of the
partition coefficient is then estimated as the sum of these
individual contributions.
the free energies of solvation of the drugs in aqueous
solution were calculated using the aml-sm2 parameter
set in amsol 3.0.1. p in these calculations, the minimized
am1 structure was held rigid and the free energy
calculated.

electronic properties of the bdz receptor ligands

although the compounds included in the present study are
fairly rigid, several families have rotational degrees of
freedom for aromatic rings and other substituents. in such
cases, the conformational profiles of these moieties were
evaluated energy conformational profiles were calculated
in 60 o increments and the resulting low energy
conformations were optimized. in general, the energy
differences between the various conformations were i 1.2
kcai/mol. a typical example of the result obtained, shown
in figure 2, indicates the various conformational minima
for flunitrazepam (flu) and their relative energies. since
am1 is known to underestimate the nitro aromatic
torsional energy barrier and although minima were found
in which the nitro group was out of plane (z2=87 “), these
conformers
were not included as candidates for
recognition. all other conformations given in figure 2
were considered
as candidates for the bioactive
conformation.

various electronic properties and environmental indices
were calculated for the bdzr ligands. these properties
were evaluated for all conformational minima found in the
am1 calculations. tables 2 to 7 report these indices for the
lowest energy conformer only. the compounds are listed
in the tables according to chemical family.

electrons centered on the same atom or associated with a

reported in table 2.

as seen in this table, the imine n site,
common to all analogs, shows the strongest proton
accepting ability, while the nature of the remaining proton
accepting groups vary among all classes of compounds.
since both high and low affinity analogs have at least 2 or
3 such sites, their presence alone is not a determinant of
recognition. however, a specific geometric relationship
among them could be such a factor. since there is no
preference in protonation energies of the lone pairs in
probing the geometric relationships of different atoms, all
were considered as possible interaction sites and those
common to high affinity analogs and absent in low affinity
ligands determined the lone pair direction to interact with a
complementary proton donating receptor moiety. of all
moieties studied, only one (the nh group) has the
possibility of acting as both a proton acceptor and a proton
donor. this duality has been addressed by this laboratory
before in a study of the b-carbolines in which this
hydrogen was replaced with a methyl group without
significant loss of affinity. 24 alternatively, it is possible
that torsional rotation (e.g. serine side chain) or tautomeric
equilibria (e.g. histidine residue) in the receptor may allow
interconversion of accepting and donating sites thus
allowing interaction with both proton donating and
accepting regions of the ligand. thus, the interaction of the
nh moiety is not definitive, without a complete

understanding of the receptor point with which it is
proposed to interact.
table 3 lists the dipole moment, total hydrophobic index,
and hydrophobic index for various rings for the bdzr
ligands. the dipole moment has considerable variation,
with the compounds zolpidem and alpidem having
unusually low dipole moments for the high affinity ligands.
comparing compounds which do and do not bind to the
receptor, it is evident that there is no relationship between
dipole moment values and recognition.
the hydrophobic index also shows variation among the
ligands. most members of the 1,4 benzodiazepine family
have rather large hydrophobic
indices, although
flunitrazepam and loprazolam are notable exceptions.
since the non-binding compounds show no marked
difference in lipophilicity from the high affinity ligands, no
relationship of this property to recognition is obtained.
however, all compounds with known high affinity to the
receptor are more soluble in a hydrophobic phase than in
an aqueous environment. examining the local contribution
to the hydrophobicity, the most lipophilic moiety for each
ligand except the ici compound was found to be an
aromatic ring, labeled ring a in figure 1. this ring, and in
the case of the ici compound the unsaturated hydrocarbon

chain, could participate either in r-x stacking or a
hydrophobic interaction with the receptor.
the calculated polarizabilities are shown in table 4. this
quantity can be considered as a general measure of the
dispersion contribution to the binding energy. table 4
shows no direct relation of either the total ~l~~bi~~
or
the local con~butions of different rings with observed
binding affinities, although compounds with unusually low
polarizabilities show low affinity for the type i bdz
receptor or do not bind at all. this conclusion is in
agreement with our previous studies.9j4c
in table 5, we report the general steric and shape
descriptors for all compounds studied. the up compounds
have very low molecular areas and volumes and show no
binding to type i or any other known receptor site. this
result suggests a minimum size requirement for recognition
of any bdzb. at the other extreme, alpidem and zolpidem
have the largest areas and volumes indicating that, while
they can be accommodated at the cerebellar type i
receptor, they could exceed a size requirement at the other
bdzr subtypes that prevents these compounds from

binding to them, thus contributing to their type i
selectivity. the other descriptors show no systematic
pattern among the compounds.
table 6 lists the solvation free energies of the ligands. this
parameter gives an indication of the importance of
desolvation in bmding to the receptor. there is no clear
distinction in this value between high and low affinity
analogs and consequently, this property is not, by itself, a
discriminant of recognition.
table 7 gives the energies of the homo and lumo and
the virtual electron density distribution on each aromatic
ring in lumo for the bdzr ligands. energies of the
lumos are small negative quantities. although negative
energies for unoccupied orbitals are not physically realistic
and a consequence of using semi-empirical methods,
comparisons of the relative order of the lumo energies
for zolpidem and alpidem from ab initio calculations25
with the results here, indicated the relative ~gnitu&s of
these vdiues can be adequately used as a measure of
electron accepting abilities. thus, these iigands can
function as efficient electron acceptors with the electron

density localized on one of the aromatic rings. in most
ligands, the aromatic ring with the localized electron
density in lumo is distinct from the most lipophilic ring.

in other compounds, however, such as the ro compounds,
the electron accepting and most lipophilic ring are the
same.

model of l&and-receptor recognition
the large diversity of chemical families that bind with
relatively high affinity to the type i cerebellar bdz site
suggest a versatile binding region. in determining the
requirements for recognition of this receptor, in order to
compare the role of proton donating sites in compounds of
diverse structure, complementary proton donor receptor
points rpi, rp2, rp3, etc. were defined. these were
placed 3.0 a from the nucleophilic ligand atoms with
which they are proposed to interact, with the possible
direction(s) of these receptor points determined by the

direction of the lone pair(s) of electrons on the ligand
heteroatoms. there are six different types of candidate
proton accepting centers in these compounds with different
degrees of flexibility in the placement of complementary
receptor points for interaction with them. for an imine
nitrogen and an amine nitrogen, there is only one lone pair
of electrons and its direction is well determined in each
case. the carbonyl oxygen atom has two lone pairs of
electrons whose positions can be defined by two different
values of torsion angles with respect to a specific atom to
which the c=o moiety is bonded (i.e. z c-c=o-rp).26
values of 2 = 0 ’ or 180 o,syn and anti, were obtained only
for those compounds in which the three atoms and the lone
pair are in the same plane. although one or the other lone
pairs of electrons are shown to be favored in crystal
structures,27 protonation energies are comparable and the
preferred direction of interaction in the binding site will be
largely determined by the position of the corresponding
proton donor in the binding site of the receptor. thus both
possible sites have been examined as candidate receptor
sites in our calculations of distances and angles. for the cl
substituent, there are three non-bonded pairs of electrons
that form a nearly spherical electron density distribution
around it and the corn lementary interacting receptor point
can be placed at a 3 g: radius in many directions from the
cl atom. the position of the complementary site with the
cl atom was chosen considering an sp3 hybridization for
the halogen and placing three receptor points in all sp3
directions, any of which could be the receptor point. for
the no2 group, there are two oxygen atoms each with two
lone pairs of electrons, allowing four positions of the
complementary proton donating moiety in the receptor.
again, protonation energies in vacua are similar for the
different sites and the preferred lone pair sites of
intermolecular interactions from crystal structures are not
helpful in choosing those in the receptor binding site since
the 3d architecture of this binding site is very different
from the crystal packing geometries. thus, all four possible
directions of the receptor point interacting with the nitro
group were considered as receptor point candidates.
in addition to the proton acceptors, both aromatic rings,
labeled a and b in figure 1, were also considered possible
moieties involved in receptor recognition. consequently,
the corresponding receptor points (rpa and rpn) were
also defined. since the interaction expected (van der
waals) is not directional, these receptor points were placed

in the center of each ring, representing the centroid of the
interaction.
once these candidate receptor points were identified,
~u~~~ep~,
a non-selective high affinity ligand, was
used as a template for pairwise comparisons of geometric
commonalties of them with all the other ligands studied.
all distances between possible receptor proton donor sites
and the angles made by these sites with the aromatic rings
were evaluated. as an illustration of this procedure, table
8 gives such a comparison between flunitrazepam and two
of these ligands. as illustrated in table 8 all possible lone
pair directions of the nitro, carbonyl oxygen and fluorine
substituents
of ~u~itrazepam
were considered
in
determining the position of possible complementary proton
donor receptor points. these included two possible
receptor points for the cat-bony1 oxygen, four for the nitro
group, and three for the fluorine atom. as shown in table
8, the distance between the receptor point interacting with
the imine nitrogen and all the other candidate receptor
donor sites were then calculated. in addition, the
corresponding angles to the lipophilic rings (rpa and
rpb), which could be involved in either recognition or
activation, were also calculated. these distances and angles
in flunitrazepam were then compared with ahr 11797,
which has only an imine nitrogen and a carbonyl oxygen as

0.307
0.199

possible proton accepting sites. we see from table 8 that
only for receptor points corresponding to interactions with
:n and the lone pair direction of the carbonyl labeled 02
are the distances and angles the same in these two
compounds. these receptor points labeled rpr and rp2 in
figure 1 and tables 9-f 1 were thus chosen as common
recognition sites between the template and this analog.
similarly, comparing flunitrazepam and zolpidem in table
8, we see that the common receptor proton donor site in
addition to that interacting with the imine nitrogen (rp 1) is
a specific one of the nitro group of the flunitrazepam,
(labeled rp3 in figure 1 and tables 9-11) and one
direction of the carbonyl oxygen of zolpidem (also labeled
rp3 in figure 1 and table 9-l 1). neither the high affinity
type i selective zolpidem nor the ahr 11797 compound,
each with only two proton accepting moieties, had a lone
pair in a similar position as any of those of the fluorine
atom in ~uni~azepam. therefore, this fourth site was
eliminated as a determinant of type i recognition. while
the pairwise comparison between flunitrazepam and
zolpidem illustrated in figure 8 alone did not totally
determine which of the lone pairs of the nitro group of
flunitrazepam and of the carbonyl group of zolpidem are
involved in receptor interactions, further pairwise
comparisons between flunitrazepam
and all other
compounds did allow a unique choice of all three proton

donating receptor points (rpr, rp2, and rp3) in all
compounds. these unique lone pair directions chosen for
each proton accepting center in each ligand to determine
the direction of the three corresponding receptor points
@pi, rp2, and rp3) are given in table 9 in terms of their
specific torsion angles. these proposed receptor points
were evaluated for steric tolerance for all ligands and were
found to be acceptable. figure 1 indicates for each
compound the proton accepting moiety used for the
labeling of these receptor points.

and the amine nh moiety in the p-carbolines can both
interact with the same receptor site. therefore, in order to
develop a ph~copho~
model which will accommodate
all classes of ligands included in this study, rp3 is
considered as a nucleophilic center located 3.0 a from the
corresponding nucleophilic atom located in the ligand,
realizing that the hydrogen atom that forms the hydrogen
bond between these two nucleophilic centers may be
covalently bound to either the receptor or the ligand,
depending on the nature of the ligand.

the specific receptor points, rpl and rp2, can be regarded
in every case as proton accepting sites, as shown in table
2. rp3, however, cannot be considered as a proton
accepting site for all ligands studied. two alternative
modes of interaction of this site with the ligand are
presented here. first, this receptor site may function as a
hydrogen bond donor, a role that is supported by a negative
region in the mep at complementary ligand sites in the
majority of the ligands included in this study. second, the
receptor point 3, rp3, might function as a hydrogen bond
acceptor as in the b-carboline and phenylacetamide series
of benzodiazepine ligands. receptor site rp3 could, for
example, be a freely rotating serine or a partially
protonated histidine side chain which could explain how
substituents such as the carbonyl oxygen atom of zolpidem

table 10 gives the distances between the proton donor
receptor points chosen for each compound. examining this
table we see that all the high affinity ligands, except ahr
11797 and cl 218,872, have sites 1 and 3 in common with
the high affinity type i selective ligands zolpidem and
alpidem, with a very similar distance of 9.5 f 1 a between
complementary receptor points rpl and rp3. ahr 11797
and cl 218,872 have sites 1 and 2 in common with
~u~~~p~,
a classical high affinity non-selective 1,4
bdz. the distance between these two proton donating
receptor points, rpr-rpz is about 6.5 f 1 a, also very
similar for all the high affinity analogs that contain them.
for the high affinity compounds that have both rp2 and
rp3, this distance between these two proton accepting sites
is also very similar, 7.5 f 0.5 1 a.

while the distances between proton accepting receptor
sites rp1 , rp2 and rp3 are very similar for all the high
affinity ligands, these distances alone are not adequate
determinants of recognition since at least one of the four
compounds with no significant receptor affinity also
satisfies two of the three distance criteria. the geometric
relationship of the most lipophilic ring a to the three
proton donating receptor points identified as possible
determinants of recognition was hence explored as a
possible additional determinant of a 3d pharmacophore for
recognition. table 11 gives the corresponding angles
between pairs of these points and the center of the

lipophilic ring. this table clearly demonstrates that the
angle between this ring and all three pairs of proton donor
receptor points i.e. the value of the rpr-rl+ring a angle
the rp+f+ring
a angle and the rpl-r&-ring
a
angle is very similar for all high affinity analogs, namely,
-80-l 15 ’ for the first, -60 “-64 for the second and -52 ‘60 ’ for the third. moreover, these angles have a different
value for the non-binding compounds. thus, the relative
position of the lipophilic ring, with respect to the three
proton accepting sites is an additional determinant of
recognition, possibly involving n-rr stacking with a
complementary aromatic ring in the receptor.

‘this is the angle to the centerof the vinyl group.

in summary, as indicated in table 12, using a small
number of structurally diverse compounds that do and do
not bind to the cerebellar type i gabaa/bdz receptor,
we have determined the minimum requirements for
recognition of this receptor. this receptor appears to have
three proton donating moieties, which we have labelled
and rp3. however,
interactions
of
rpr, rp2
complementary ligand moieties with all three of these
points do not seem to be a requirement for high affinity
binding to this receptor subtype. rather ligand recognition
of this receptor appears to require complementary
nucleophilic moieties to interact with rpr and either rp2
or rp3. thus ligands can bind to this receptor if they can
interact with two proton donating receptor sites (rp 1,rf3)
in common with zolpidem and alp&m, separated by about
9-l 18, and if they have an aromatic lipophilic ring making
an angle of about 60 ’ with these sites. alternatively,
recognition of this receptor can occur by ligands that share
one of these sites (site 1) with zolpidem and alpidem and
one with high affinity non-selective ligands such as
flunitrazepam (site 2). sites 1 and 2 are separated by a
shorter distance of about 5-7 a with these two sites
making an angle in the range of 80-120 ’ with a lipophilic
aromatic ring. the absence of proton accepting site 2 in
type i selective ligands zolpidem and alp&m, in addition
to a size restriction already noted, might contribute to their
lack of binding to other receptor subtypes that require this
site. the implications of the absence of proton accepting
site 3, as in the ahr and cl compounds are less apparent.
compounds that have all three nucleophilic sites, appear to
be non-selective and have similar distances between rp;!
andrp3 of 7.5-8.5 8, and similar angles of 60-85 ’ with
the lipophilic ring a.
mode of ligand-receptor activation
until evidence is provided that specific bdzr subtypes
mediate different behavioral endpoints, modulation of
gaba effects on chloride ion flux is one of the only
properties that can be directly related to activation of the
gabaa/bdz receptor through a specific receptor subtype.
such studies are underway in our laboratory and we
currently have reliable experimental results for the effect
on the chloride ion flux in cerebellum for three of the
compounds included in the present study.28 these results
are consistent with the observation based on in vivo
endpoints that flunitrazepam is an agonist, since it was

found to enhance gaba stimulated chloride ion flux, that
dmcm is an  xxxd1422xxx , since it diminishes this flux,
and that ro15-1788 is an antagonist, since it has no effect
on the flux and antagonizes the effect of both
fhmitrazepam and dmcm. these three compounds can
then be used as templates to identify possible discriminants
of activation of the cerebellar gabaa/bdz receptor.

as discussed previously, the energy of the lumo for all
the compounds studied is small enough to implicate a
charge transfer mechanism of activation. in each of the 13
compounds considered the electron density in lumo is
centered mainly on an aromatic ring that would then be the
main moiety involved in such a charge transfer
mechanism we have thus examined whether the aromatic
ring with the greatest electron density in lumo is a
determinant of activation.
in order to investigate this possibility, we superimposed
the three compounds flunitrazepam, ro 15-1788, and
dmcm of differing activity, as shown in figure 3, such
that they could all interact with the common receptor
points rpr , rf’2, rp3 and the lipophilic region already
identified as determinants of recognition. with the

cecebellarbdz nxeptor site

recognition conditions satisfied, we then examined the
relative positions of the aromatic ring with maximum
electron density in lumo that would act as an electron
acceptor in each of the three ligands. we see in this figure
that a second aromatic ring (ring b) on which the electron
density in lumo is primarily located (table 7) is found in
a different location for the agonist and  xxxd1422xxx . in
the antagonist, the most lipophilic ring involved in
recognition is also the one with the most electron density in
lumo. the discriminant position of this electron
accepting ring in the agonist and  xxxd1422xxx  and
antagonist (figure 3) and its already identified role in
recognition rather than activation in the antagonist,
strongly implicate ring b in a mechanism of activation of
the cerebellar bdz receptor by charge transfer to it from a
corresponding aromatic donor ring such as histidine, in the
receptor.
this mechanism of activation, namely electron transfer, is
similar to that originally proposed by us in our previous
studies of non-selective bdzr ligandsg and has been
proposed as a possible mode of interaction by others. 2g in
our previous study, electron transfer was implicated in
activation since relative activity of the six agonists studied
varied as their electron accepting ability as measured by
ho.
however, in reference 9, it was the position of the
most lipophilic ring in each compound (ring a) that was

1043

found to have a different position in agonists, antagonists,
and inverse agonists. the results of this study differ in that
we have determined that the most lipophilic ring is the
most electron accepting ring only for the antagonists and
that it is ring b for agonists and for inverse agonists. in
addition, in this work we define criteria for recognition in
terms of common receptor points, rather than moieties of
the ligands themselves. therefore, the moiety responsible
for electron transfer and its geometric relationship to the
determinants of recognition differ significantly from our
previous work.
since receptor points rp1 and the lipophilic ring are
proposed as universal requirements for recognition of the
cerebellar bdz receptor by agonists, antagonists and
inverse agonists, the discriminant for activation can be
defined as the angle between the aromatic ring implicated
as an electron acceptor site in lumo, rpi and the
lipophilic aromatic ring. this angle was measured from the
center of the electron accepting ring to rp 1 to a point in the
center of the lipophilic ring. the value of this angle
calculated for the compounds studied is reported in table
13. it is 47 ’ in flunitrazepam, a value that should be
predictive of agonist activity and 77 ’ in dmcm, a value
that should be predictive of  xxxd1422xxx  activity. this
angle is not defined in the antagonist ro15-1788, since the
electron accepting and lipophilic ring are the same ring.

between
type i receptors

agonism and antagonism.
validation of the proposed recognition pharmacophore
a large number of structure-activity relationship (sar)
studies has been reported in the literature for diverse
compounds.3o among these, a number of specific
examples of various classes of ligands were chosen to
validate our current pharmacophore.
 xxxd3375xxx  and roo5-3305 were included as additional
ligands which show no affinity for the bdz receptor(s).
these ligands were added to our control compounds
because of their similarity in structure to other, higher
affinity, ligands. although as shown in tables 10-11,
roo5-3305 fulfills the distance requirements for both rp irp3 and rpl-rpz, its lipophilic ring does not meet the
angle criteria (table 11).  xxxd3375xxx  meets the distance
requirements for rpr-rp2 (table 10) only but also does
not have the appropriate angle (table 11). therefore, in
agreement with experiments, using our criteria, we would
classify these two compounds as non-binders at the type i
bdz receptor, although assuming greater flexibility, a low
affmity might be exhibited by these compounds, especially
 xxxd3375xxx .

seven high affinity ligands which are thought to be nonselective were also included for validation, assuming that
measured high affinities in whole brain would parallel
those in cerebellum.% these ligands are: ro15-3505,
ro15-4513, ro14-7437, 2-oxoquazepam, loprazolam,
midazolam, and ici 190,622. as shown in tables 10 and
11, all seven of these compounds fulfill the requirements
for recognition, based on our current pharmacophore.

another validation of the criteria for recognition is that
they provide an explanation for a puzzling aspect of
substituent modulation of 1,4 bdz receptor affinities,
again, assuming that measured affinities in whole brain of
these non-selective
compounds parallel those in
cerebellum it has generally been observed that electronwithdrawing groups (n02, cl, cf3) at either the 7 or 2
positions increases the binding affinity whereas having
such substituents at both positions lead to only a small
additional increase in binding.31 this trend can be
satisfactorily explained using the present recognition
pharmacophore. figure 5 shows the positions of the 2’ and
7 substituent in flunitrazepam. as can be seen, either of
these substituents can interact with the proton donor
receptor point rp3, assuming there is free rotation of the
aromatic ring and nitro substituent. thus, both sites are not
needed for recognition at rp3, since either substituent at
the 2’ or the 7 position will allow recognition.

examination of the results for pk 11195 and  xxxd2999xxx 
have led to the proposal of an additional steric
requirement for recognition. pk 11195 is known to bind
to the peripheral bdz binding site but shows no significant
binding to the cns site. preliminary cerebellum data for
pk 11195 (ki > looo),is consistent with the observation
that this ligand has virtually no binding in whole brain.
examining the requirements for recognition (tables 10,ll
and 12), pk 11195 is found to f&ill the requirements for
receptor points 1,2, and the li~p~ic ring, similar to ahr
11797. thus, based on these criteria alone, we would
predict pk 1i195 to bind with some affinity to the type i
bdz receptor.

to probe the lack of binding of this ligand, it was
superimposed on flunitrazzpam in such a manner that the
three common recognition sites, rpr , rf3, and the
lipophilic rings, overlapped (figure 6). we see from this
fignre that the bulky isopropyl group (ch(ch& would
sterically interfere with the proton donating function of
receptor point two (rp2).
 xxxd2999xxx , a ‘classical’ 1,4 bdz with low affinity and
agonist activity, has an unusual substituent at its one
position, a cyclopropyl group. although the binding in
cerebellum has not yet been reported, this compound has
been shown to bind significantly weaker in whole brain
that other 1,4 bdzs. as seen in figure 7,  xxxd2999xxx  also
has a significant steric hindrance to interaction with
receptor point two. unlike pk 11195, however, the
presence of rp3 in  xxxd2999xxx  still allow it to meet the
minimum requirements for recognition and it would be
predicted to have some affinity for the type i bdz
receptor. thus consideration of both pk 11195 and
 xxxd2999xxx  have allowed the identification of a sterically
inaccessible region in the binding site around rp2.

by contrast, a sterically accessible region, a lipophilic

identified. figure 8 shows a superimposition

recognition sites overlap. the large, lipophilic group of
loprazolam fits nicely between rp2 and rp3, without
causing the receptor points to move from the ideal overlap
with flunitrazepam. this result indicates that loprazolam
should bind to the type i bdzr with high affinity, and
since it contains all three receptor points, it should show no
appreciable selectivity. although binding in cerebellum
has not been reported, this prediction is consistent with the
high affinity of loprazolam in whole braina both this
sterically accessible region and the inaccessible area found
with pk 11195 are shown in the pharmacophore in

criteria

while there are no additional compounds as yet with
robust and reproducible effects on gabaa stimulated clion flux in cerebellum the observation that this behavior
parallels that of in vivo endpoints allows some comparison
to be made between our predicted effect on cl- ion flux
and known behavioral endpoints. the high affinity rols3505 and ro14-7437 have antagonist properties at
behavioral endpoints thus far reported. midazolam and
loprazolam, two high affinity ‘classical’ bdz ligands have
agonist activity at most behavioral endpoints as do the
more novel ligands 2-oxoquazepam and ici 190,622.
consistent with these observations, rols-3505 and ro147437 are predicted to be antagonists and the other four to
be agonists (table 13) based on criteria developed for clion flux activity.

conchlsions
comparing the type i bdzr pharmacophores developed
here with previously proposed models reported in the
literature for a single generic bdz receptor, the following
similarities and differences emerge. in comparison with

1047

our previously proposed single receptor pharmacophore,g a
third recognition component, a lipophilic ring possibly
involved in x;-rr stacking with the receptor, is proposed in
addition to two proton accepting sites. cook and coworker~‘~ have proposed a recognition pharmacophore for
a single generic bdz receptor, assuming that the inverse
agonist/antagonist and the agonist binding sites are each
different regions of the same domain and using a series of
p-carbolines, benzodiazepines, and pyrazoloquinoline
compounds. by contrast, in this study, we have
demonstrated that all compounds characterized that bind to
the type i bdz receptor possess similar recognition
properties, independent of their activity. therefore, there is
no apparent reason to impose different binding sites for
compounds of differing activities. the agonist recognition
criteria proposed by cook includes two proton donating
receptor points hl and h2 and an aromatic, lipophilic ring
and in the  xxxd1422xxx  model, he includes one accepting
site a2, with the distances between these four receptor
points comparable to those between rpt , rf5, rp3 and
ring a in our model. however, he includes a second
lipophilic region in recognition criteria, that occupied by
the alkyl ester group of the j3 -carbolines. in our
pharmacophore, this region is a site of limited lipophilic
tolerance, as shown by pk 11195 and  xxxd2999xxx  while the
region that can accommodate a larger lipophilic moiety lies
between rp2 and rp3, as seen, for example, with
loprazolam.
with respect to requirements for activation, cook and coworkers proposed that agonism was the result of the
combined effect of a lipophilic ~-ring and the small
lipophilic moiety between rpl and rp3 along with three
receptor points. by contrast, in the pharmacophore
proposed here, these are determinants of recognition and
not activation since all ligands, regardless of their activity,
fulfill these requirements. instead, activation in our model
is proposed to occur through a charge transfer interaction
between an electron accepting aromatic ring of the ligand
and an electron donating ring such as histidine or
tryptophan, in the receptor.
in summary, characterization
of the conformational
electronic and physical properties of 13 bdzr ligands,
together with receptor binding activation data have allowed
a self-consistent
model for ligand recognition and
activation of the bdz cerebellum type i receptor to be
formulated (figure 4). the model incorporates three
hydrogen bonding receptor points and a lipophilic ring in a
particular geometric arrangement, a sterically excluded
region near rp2 and an additional lipophilic receptor
pocket, not required for recognition but which can
accommodate a lipophilic region of the ligand between
rp2 and rp3. the major determinant of activation is
proposed to be the position of an electron accepting
aromatic ring that could be involved in a charge transfer
complex with the receptor. this moiety is located in the
center of the binding pocket but in different positions for
agonists and inverse agonists. this feature of the proposed
pharmacophore is consistent with data reported by
prit~het.t*~ which suggest that the binding cleft is
composed of residues from more than one subunit rather

l.t.schovj? aal.

104s

than being localized in a binding site composed of a single
polypeptide chain. it is conceivable that the inverse
agonists could activate a different subunit than the
agonists, since their electron accepting rings are in
different regions of the pocket. agonist activity could then
be further modulated by differences in the energy of the
lumo (table 7). thus, the difference in the agonist
activity of compounds such as flunitrazepam and zolpidem
would be a result of the decrease in energy of their
lumos, from -1.4 to -0.3 kcal/mol, respectively.
experimental data for 11 additional compounds, not
included in hypothesis development,
were used to
successfully evaluate the predictive ability of the current
pharmacophore and to add prohibited and allowed steric
regions to it. the resulting pharmacophore developed here
for recognition and activation at the type i benzodiazepine
receptor explains disparate binding capability and type of
activity for 24 ligands from a large variety of chemical
families. all high affinity compounds studied fulfill the
requirements
of the pharmacophore
and, by
complementarity, allows a description of many features of
the benzodiazepine type i binding site.
