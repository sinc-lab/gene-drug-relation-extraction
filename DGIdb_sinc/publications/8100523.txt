peptides of the glucagodvasoactive-intestinal-peptide (vip) peptide family share a considerable
sequence similarity at their n-terminus. they either start with tyr-ala, his-ala or his-ser which
might be in part potential targets for dipeptidyl-peptidase iv, a highly specialized aminopeptidase
removing dipeptides only from peptides with n-terminal penultimate proline or alanine. growthhormone-releasing factor(1-29)amide and gastric inhibitory peptidefglucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (gip) with terminal tyr-ala as well as glucagon-like peptide-1(7 - 36)amidehnsulinotropin [glp-l(7 - 36)amidel and peptide histidine methionine (phm) with terminal his-ala were
hydrolysed to their des-xaa- ala derivatives by dipeptidyl-peptidase iv purified from human placenta. vip with terminal his-ser was not significantly degraded by the peptidase. the kinetics of
the hydrolysis of gip, glp-1(7-36)amide and phm were analyzed in detail. for these peptides k,
values of 4-34 pm and v,,, values of 0.6-3.8 pmol . min-' . mg protein-' were determined for the
purified peptidase which should allow their enzymic degradation also at physiological, nanomolar
concentrations. when human serum was incubated with gip or glp-1(7-36)amide the same fragments as with the purified dipeptidyl-peptidase iv, namely the des-xaa- ala peptides and tyr-ala
in the case of gip or his-ala in the case of glp-1(7-36)amide, were identified as the main
degradation products of these peptide hormones. incorporation of inhibitors specific for dipeptidylpeptidase iv, 1 mm lys-pyrrolidide or 0.1 mm diprotin a (ile-pro-ile), completely abolished the
production of these fragments by serum. it is concluded that dipeptidyl-peptidase iv initiates the
metabolism of gip and glp-1(7-36)amide in human serum. since an intact n-terminus is obligate
for the biological activity of the members of the glucagonnip peptide family [e. g. gip(3-42) is
known to be inactive to release insulin in the presence of glucose as does intact gip], dipeptidylpeptidase-iv action inactivates these peptide hormones. the relevance of this finding for their
inactivation and their determination by immunoassays is discussed.

dipeptidyl-peptidase iv ( xxxg651xxx ) is a highly specialized
aminopeptidase removing dipeptides from bioactive peptides
and synthetic peptide substrates provided that proline or alanine are the penultimate n-terminal residues (mentlein,
1988, for review). small peptides or chromogenic substrates
with proline in this position are far better hydrolysed than
those with alanine (heins et al., 1988).  xxxg651xxx  occurs in
human serum, as an ectoenzyme on the surface of capillary
endothelial cells, at kidney brush-border membranes, on the

thymocytes (here termed cd 26, or thymocyte-activating
molecule) and other sites (loijda, 1979; nausch and heymann, 1985; mentlein et al., 1984; mccaughan et al., 1990).
the enzyme has been shown to be responsible for the degradation and inactivation of circulating peptides with penultimate proline, like  xxxg2240xxx  (heymann and mentlein,
1978; ahmad et al., 1992), but also for growth-hormonereleasing factor (grf) with penultimate alanine (frohman et
al., 1989; kubiak, 1989; boulanger et al., 1992).
[alai5]grf(1-29)amide with penultimate ala is even a
comparably good substrate as a synthetic pro'-containing derivative for purified  xxxg651xxx  (bongers et al., 1992). this suggests that the conformation or chain length may greatly influence the cleavage of peptides with penultimate prolinefalanine-residues by  xxxg651xxx .
we therefore evaluated whether or not other peptide hormones related to grf might be substrates for  xxxg651xxx , and
whether this probable proteolytic degradation might be of
relevance in the circulation. grf belongs to the glucagod

(other peptides) were used for separations. in some hplc
separations, trifluoroacetic acid was replaced by heptafluorobutyric acid. peptides and their degradation products were
monitored by their absorbance at 220 nm (peptide bonds) or
280 nm (aromatic amino acids). they were quantified by integration of their peak areas related to those of standards
(synthetic tyr-ala or turncated peptides made by complete
dipeptidyl-peptidase iv digestion). the concentrations of all
peptide solutions were routinely calculated from their absorbance at 280 nm relative to their content of trp and tyr
(using additively the known absorption coefficients).
activities were determined from estimations with less
than 10% substrate turnover. catalytic constants were calculated according to the statistical method of wilkinson (1961).

and separated by reverse-phase hplc as described by
stocchi et al. (1985) for amino acids.

experimental procedures
peptides, inhibitors and enzymes
synthetic peptide hormones (human sequences) were obtained from saxon biochemicals, dipeptides and diprotin a
were purchased from bachem. purity of peptides was
checked by hplc ; their amino acid compositions were analyzed by the manufacturer. lys-pyrrolidide was a gift from
dr. mike schutkowski, martin-luther-universitat halle/
saale, germany. dipeptidyl-peptidase iv was purified from
human placenta and free of contaminating proteases (piischel
et al., 1982).

degradation assays with purified enzyme
5 nmol of the peptides (5 pl of a 1 mm solution in water)
were incubated at 37°c with 0.1 pg peptidase in 50 mm triethanolaminekic1, ph 7.8, for 10-60 min in 500 pl (final
peptide concentration 10 pm) or less (other peptide concentrations). enzymic reactions were terminated by addition of
5 pl 10% trifluoroacetic acid, and the mixtures applied onto
a vydac c,, widepore (30-nm pores, 5-pm particles)
250 mm x 4.6 mm hplc column and eluted at a flow rate of
1 d m i n with gradients of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. either a linear gradient of 0-80% acetonitrile
formed within 42 min (gip degradation), or a stepwise linear
gradient of 0-32% acetonitrile formed in 17 min followed
by linear gradient of 32-48% acetonitrile formed in 30 min

peptide chemistry and other assays
fragments separated by hplc were collected and lyophilized for chemical determinations. amino acid composition was determined by acid hydrolysis (6 m hc1 in vucuo
at 100°c for 24 h) followed by lyophilisation, reaction with
4-dimethylaminoazobenzene-sulphonyl-chloride and hplc
separation of derivatized amino acids (stocchi et al., 1985).
n-terminal amino acids were determined by manual microsequencing with 4-n,n-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4'-isothiocyanate (wittmann-liebold et al., 1986).
hydrolysis of 0.5 mm gly-pro-4-nitranilide at ph 8.6
and at 37°c was monitored as described (mentlein and
struckhoff, 1989).

results
digestion of peptides by purified  xxxg651xxx 
 xxxg651xxx  purified from human placenta liberated tyr-ala
from grf(1-29)amide and gip, and his-ala from glpl(7 -36)amide and phm (table 1, fig. 2). no further proteolytic cleavage of these peptides was observed indicating the
high specificity of the  xxxg651xxx  for n-terminal xaa-ala (and
xaa-pro) and the absence of contaminating proteases in the
enzyme preparation. liberated tyr-ala (fig. 2) was identified by its retention time and co-chromatography with a
synthetic standard. his-ala was adsorbed to the c,, column

only with heptafluorobutyric acid as ion-pairing reagent (table 2) which, however, resulted in a relatively high background. therefore, liberated his-ala was also identified as
its 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene-sulphonyl-derivative (obtained also with a synthetic dipeptide standard). moreover,
the truncated peptides could be separated from the non-degraded ones in reverse-phase hplc (fig. 2, table 2).
highest initial velocities for  xxxg651xxx  degradation at
micromolar peptide concentrations were found for grf(129)amide, whereas those for other members of the vipfglucagon-related peptides with penultimate ala were lower (table 1). no significant cleavage was observed with vip tested
as a representative member of this peptide family with nterminal his-ser.  xxxg651xxx  hydrolysed gip, glp-l(7 - 36)amide and phm with k,,, values in the range 4-34 pm (table

3). these values are of the same order of magnitude as those
determined earlier for the cleavage of other bioactive peptides with n-terminal xaa-pro or xaa-ala by  xxxg651xxx . k ,
values in the micromolar range have been generally found
for other peptide-degrading proteases. therefore, degradation
rates at physiological peptide concentrations in the nanomolar ranges are given by the rate (specificity) constants kjk,,,.
high rate constants indicate high cleavage rates at nanomolar
concentrations (below k,,, value). k,,jk,,, values of about
105m-'.s-' for gip, glp-1(7-36)amide and phm (table 3)
are lower than those determined earlier for good  xxxg651xxx 
substrates like  xxxg2240xxx , but still high enough to ensure a
physiological action.

degradation of gip and glp-1(7-36)amide
by human serum
when human serum was incubated with 20 pm gip, two
major degradation products were observed (fig. 3): one eluting at the position of tyr-ala, the other at that of des-tyrala-gif! identity of these peaks was ensured by identical
retention times with standards (prepared by digestion with
pure  xxxg651xxx ) as well as by amino-acid analysis of the tyrala peak and determination of the n-terminal amino acid of
the gip (3 -42)-peak, both collected after separation. moreover, addition of the  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors l mm lys-pyrrolidide or 0.1 mm diprotin a abolished the generation of both
gip fragments by human serum nearly completely (residual
areas <5%). hydrolysis of 0.5 mm gly-pro-4-nitranilide (an
established chromogenic substrate of  xxxg651xxx ) in the same
serum sample was reduced to 2% in the presence of 1 mh4
lys-pyrrolidide and to 9% after addition of 0.1 mm diprotin
a. lys-pyrrolidide (lys-tetrahydropyrrole), a substrate analog, and diprotin a (ile-pro-ile), a bad, but high-affinity
(k,,,
= 4 pm) substrate (rahfeld et al., 1991a), are competitive inhibitors specific (as far tested) for  xxxg651xxx . concluded

(bongers et al., 1992). in contrast, substrates with synthetic
hydrophobic derivatives of the proline ring (oxa- or thia derivatives) or short, unbranched hydrophobic alkyl derivatives
in the p, position are good substrates for  xxxg651xxx  (rahfeld et
al., 1991b; schutkowski, 1991). this indicates a hydrophobic substrate (pi) recognition site for  xxxg651xxx  where ser is
less well (or not) bound than ala or pro (fig. 4). moreover,
a bulky n-terminal amino acid with free amino group (pz

based on the identification of cleavage products and influence of specific inhibitors,  xxxg651xxx  is the main degradation enzyme for glp-l(7 - 36)amide in human serum. buckley and lundquist (1992) have reported recently in an abstract the formation of glp-l(9 -37) by human plasma, but
did not identify the peptidase responsible for its generation.
as outlined for gip above, plasma-membrane-bound dpp
iv of endothelial and other cells might be still more important for the inactivation of glp-l(7 - 36)amide than the
plasma activity.
phm (rat counterpart phi) and vip are processing products of a common precursor and are co-released from central
and peripheral neurons. as far as is known, phmphi have
biological effects similar or identical to vip. since it is
known that the biological actions of vip critically depend on
an intact n-terminus (christophe et al., 1989; robberecht et
al., 1990), in analogy also p h w h i might be inactivated by
cleavage of the n-terminal dipeptide by  xxxg651xxx . since serum
concentrations of phm like vip are low and in contrast to
gip and glp-1(7-36)amide do not rise postprandially (boden and shelmet, 1986), inactivation in serum is probably of
minor importance and was not investigated. it can, however,
be suspected that  xxxg651xxx  cleaves the paracrine acting peptides phmphi in other tissues where it is present on the
surface of various epithelial and endothelial cells.
in conclusion, members of the glucagonnip peptide
family with n-terminal tyr-ala or his-ala, namely grf,
gip, glp-1(7-36)amide and phm, are inactivated by action
of  xxxg651xxx  in human serum. the truncated peptides could
also be antagonists, because the binding specificity is directed by the c-terminal parts of these peptide hormones
(christophe et al., 1989; gallwitz et al., 1990). since the
cleavage by this peptidase removes only 2 of 29-42 total
residues of the hormones, antisera against these peptides not
directed specially to the n-terminus should cross-react also
with the truncated peptides. therefore, immunoassays for
these hormones can be hampered by the measurement of biologically inactive, des-xaa- ala forms beside the active peptide, due a potential cross-reactivity of the antisera. unless
specific n-terminally directed antisera are available, serum
samples should be stored for immunoassays at least in the
presence of  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors (specific ones mentioned here
or  xxxg745xxx  inhibitors like phenylmethanesulphonyl
fluoride).
 xxxg651xxx  in human serum and at the surface of endothelial
cells is known to be involved in the inactivation of other
circulating bioactive peptides : removal of the n-terminal
tetrapeptide arg-pro-lys-pro of  xxxg2240xxx  (heymann and
mentlein, 1978) inactivates only some biological actions of
this neuropeptide (e. g. histamine release from mast cells),
but renders the peptide possible for the complete degradation
by  xxxg163xxx  (ahmad et al., 1992). several other
bioactive peptide with n-terminal xaa-pro including gastrinreleasing peptide,  xxxd1752xxx -like intermediate lobe peptide and j?-casomorphin are excellent substrates for the purified peptidase (nausch et al., 1990).
