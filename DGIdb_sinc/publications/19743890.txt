background:  xxxd2579xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx ) agents are the mainstay of oral
therapy for ulcerative colitis (uc).  xxxd282xxx , a prodrug of  xxxd2579xxx , has
recently been approved for the treatment of uc. objective: to summarize
current data on  xxxd282xxx  and to discuss its impact on management of uc.
methods: a systematic review of published literature was performed on
pubmed using the search terms ‘ xxxd282xxx ’ and ‘ xxxd282xxx ™’. the cochrane
database was also reviewed. results: balsalzide, a  xxxd2579xxx  prodrug, ulilizes
azoreduction by colonic bacteria to achieve a sustained release of active
 xxxd2579xxx  throughout the colon. a recent clinical trial has demonstrated  xxxd282xxx  6.7 g/day to be superior to placebo in inducing remission in symptomatic uc. the drug is well tolerated with a safety profile comparable to
other oral  xxxd2579xxx  agents. the current data suggests that symptomatic remission occurs with both greater swiftness and greater frequency when compared with  xxxd2579xxx . conclusion:  xxxd282xxx  is approved for the treatment
of mild-to-moderate active uc. it is efficacious for the induction of remission
in mild to moderate uc and has a favorable safety profile, with the added
advantages of greater efficacy of remission induction and rapidity of onset.

introduction

ulcerative colitis (uc) is an inflammatory bowel disease characterized by relapsing and remitting inflammation of the large intestine. the exact etiology of uc
remains largely unknown; however, several factors have been implicated in the
pathogenesis of uc: i) genetic factors leading to dysfunction of the innate
immune response; and ii) host environment (including diet, medications, intestinal
flora, illness).
in north america and western europe, the incidence rates range from 6.0 to
8 cases per 100,000 person-years and the prevalence ranges from 70 to 150 cases
per 100,000 persons [1]. a population-based study based in northern india (punjab) found a similar disease frequency [2]. uc has a peak incidence occurring in
adolescence and early adulthood, and a secondary peak in late middle age. while
no direct mendelian inheritance model has been described, a strong family predominance exists, with ∼ 18% of monozogotic twins with concordant uc [3].
the inflammatory effects of uc are restricted to the colonic mucosa and affect
the colon from the rectum proximally in a symmetric uninterrupted fashion, and
may involve part or all of the large bowel. the most common presenting symptoms
of uc include rectal bleeding, diarrhea and abdominal pain.

histologically, uc is characterized by the presence of
accumulations of polymorphonuclear neutrophils in the
crypts of the colon (crypt abscesses) with epithelial ulceration, edema and hemorrhage. current thinking regarding
the etiology and pathogenesis of uc involves the interaction
of three elements: genetic susceptibility, host immunity and
environmental factors. the dysregulation of the enteric
immune response to bacterial and ingested (food-related)
antigens in genetically predisposed individuals leads to the
development of acute and chronic inflammation and the
pathologic features described above.
mild disease is seen in 50 – 60% of patients, with the
insidious onset of diarrhea at first, and evolving to hematochezia. this form of uc is not associated with weight loss,
is typically confined to the distal colon and responds well to
treatment [1].
moderate colitis is found in 30% of patients and is characterized by bloody diarrhea, cramps, tenesmus and abdominal pain and is frequently accompanied by anorexia, weight
loss, low-grade fever and mild anemia. severe colitis affects
roughly 10% of individuals with uc, with symptoms
including greater than six bloody bowel movements per day,
fever, leukocytosis and hypoalbuminemia. these individuals
may experience serious complications, including severe
hemorrhage, toxic megacolon and intestinal perforation.
in addition to the immediate effects of flare of uc, sufferers
are at risk of developing several long-term sequelae. colonic
strictures develop in ∼ 5% of uc patients, most commonly
in those with extensive colitis over a long duration [4]. those
with uc are also at increased risk for developing colorectal
cancer. the incidence of colorectal cancer varies depending
on a number of factors (extent of disease, duration, family
history, age at diagnosis), with the risk estimated to be
0.5 – 1.0% per year after 10 years of disease [5].
the treatment of uc centers on control of inflammation
and modulation of the immune response. treatment occurs
in two phases: i) induction of remission; and ii) maintenance
of remission. anti-inflammatory medications include corticosteroids (both systemic and topical) and  xxxd2579xxx 
( xxxd2579xxx ) based compounds ( xxxd3255xxx ,  xxxd2781xxx ,  xxxd2579xxx  and  xxxd282xxx ); modulation of the immune response is
targeted through the use of the  xxxd371xxx  (azothioprine,  xxxd2573xxx ), immunosuppressants (cyclosporine)
and anti-tnf-alpha therapy (infliximab). probiotics have been
shown to have benefits as well, especially in the treatment of
mild to moderate uc. initial treatment is based on disease
location and severity.

introduction to the compound and market  
overview
2.

 xxxd3255xxx  was the first medication used to successfully treat
uc after its introduction in 1942. this medication is made
from  xxxd2579xxx  which is linked to a sulfapyridine molecule
through a diazo bond [6]. the  xxxd2579xxx  molecule was determined
1280

to be the therapeutically active molecule, which is liberated
when the azo-bond is cleaved by bacterial azoreductases in the
colon, with the sulfa moiety functioning as a carrier molecule [7,8].  xxxd3255xxx  has been used for the treatment of mild
to moderate uc for decades.
the limitations of treatment with  xxxd3255xxx  come largely in
the form of side effects. as many as 30% of individuals taking
the medication report side effects, determined to be secondary to
the sulfapyridine moiety in a dose-dependent fashion.
the adverse effects of this medication and the therapeutic
limitations caused by these were the impetus for years of
research to create alternative methods of delivering  xxxd2579xxx  in
therapeutic amounts to the colon.
2.1

chemistry

 xxxd282xxx  has the chemical name (e)-5-[[-4-[[(2carboxyethyl) amino]carbonyl] phenyl]azo]-2-hydroxybenzoic
acid, disodium salt, dihydrate. coliform bacteria in the colon
metabolize the azo-bond in this molecule, liberating  xxxd2579xxx 
from the inert carrier molecule, 4-aminobenzoyl-beta-alanine
and n-acetylated metabolites. because of this,  xxxd282xxx  is
mainly active in the colon.
the exact mechanisms of action responsible for the efficacy of the  xxxd2579xxx  compounds are not fully understood;
however, it has been theorized, based on in vitro investigations, that the 5-asas have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties which may be responsible for their
therapeutic action.
5-asas inhibit prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis
through the inhibition of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase
enzymes in the metabolic pathway of  xxxd208xxx , thus,
preventing the synthesis of inflammatory prostaglandins [9-11].
the 5-asas have been shown in several in vitro studies to
have immunosuppressive effects through several mechanisms.
they have the ability to block dna synthesis and retard cell
cycle progression, thereby, slowing the expansion of t- and
b-cell populations. additionally, the activation of t cells was
shown to be inhibited through the reduction of accumulation
of the  xxxg1175xxx  alpha-chain in vitro [12].
2.2

pharmacokinetics and metabolism

as stated earlier,  xxxd282xxx  is azo-reduced in the colon to
 xxxd2579xxx  (active agent) and 4-aminobenzoyl-beta-alanine (inert).
as the medication is poorly absorbed in the small and large
intestines, the effect of the medication is topical and the
systemic half-life is not known.  xxxd282xxx  is excreted as a
metabolite primarily in feces (65% as  xxxd2579xxx  or metabolites)
and urine (25% n-acetylated metabilites); < 1% of the parent drug is found in the urine or feces. the onset of action
of the medication is variable, and may take days to weeks to
reach full clinical effectiveness.
2.3

clinical efficacy

the clinical efficacy of 5-asas in the treatment of uc has
been demonstrated in a number of clinical trials. in the

wiggins & rajapakse

most recent cochrane review of the efficacy of  xxxd2579xxx  in
the induction of remission in uc, eight trials (two involving
 xxxd2579xxx , four involving  xxxd2781xxx ) comprising 995 patients
demonstrated superiority of 5-asas versus placebo in a dosedependent fashion, with 5-asas demonstrating greater efficacy
in all dosage subgroups. two of the studies above reported
failure to achieve complete endoscopic remission; however,
superiority of  xxxd2579xxx  over placebo was demonstrated by a
pooled odds ratio of 0.67. subgroup analysis of the superiority
of  xxxd2579xxx  only reached statistical significance in the treatment
arms with dosages greater than or equal to 3 g/day [13].
several trials specifically looking at  xxxd282xxx  have been
performed. in one investigation by green et al., a randomized,
double-blind study was performed comparing balasalazide, 6.75
g daily, with  xxxd2579xxx , 2.4 g daily, administered for 4, 8 or
12 weeks to 101 patients with symptomatic, sigmoidoscopically
verified uc. the results showed a greater percentage of individuals achieving symptomatic remission at weeks 2, 4, 8 and
12. additionally, more individuals in the  xxxd282xxx  arm experienced complete remission after 4 (38 versus 12%) and 12
(62 versus 37%) weeks, while experiencing less adverse events
(48 versus 71%) [14].
in a second study by pruitt et al., 173 patients with sigmoidoscopically verified uc were randomized to 8 weeks of doubleblind treatment with  xxxd282xxx  6.75 g/day or  xxxd2579xxx 
2.4 g/day. the results showed similar efficacy in terms of induction of remission (46% of  xxxd282xxx  versus 44% of  xxxd2579xxx ); however, patients in the  xxxd282xxx  group experienced
symptomatic remission 12 days earlier (25 versus 37 days) [15].
it should be noted that there are no trials to date comparing
 xxxd282xxx  6.75 g/day to a higher dose of  xxxd2579xxx .
in another recent meta-analysis by rahimi et al., the
investigators examined six randomized, placebo-controlled
trials comparing the efficacy of  xxxd2579xxx  to  xxxd282xxx  for
the induction and maintenance of remission in individuals
with uc. in this study,  xxxd282xxx  was found to have a statistically significant benefit in inducing remission, but was
shown to be equally efficacious in remission maintenance as
 xxxd2579xxx  [16]. the combination of  xxxd282xxx  and vsl#3
has been shown to be effective in combination, according to
a study by tursi et al. in this study, low dose  xxxd282xxx 
(2.25 g) in combination with vsl#3 was shown to have
significantly greater efficacy in inducing remission versus
medium dose (4.5 g)  xxxd282xxx  alone [17].
regular use of  xxxd2579xxx  (not specifically  xxxd282xxx ) in
individuals with colitis has been linked to a reduction in the
incidence of colon cancer. the anti-inflammatory effect of
 xxxd2579xxx  seems not to be mediated by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, but rather by free-radical scavenging, inhibition of lipooxygenase, modulation of the prostaglandin profile and by
interference with leukocyte function. data regarding the effectiveness of  xxxd2579xxx  in the chemoprevention of colon cancer is
conflicting, but a proposed mechanism of action includes the
induction of apoptosis and prevention of proliferation, probably
through involvement of  xxxg1807xxx  in colonocytes [18].

2.4

safety and tolerability

the newer  xxxd2579xxx  preparations are generally well tolerated
and have fewer side effects that  xxxd3255xxx .  xxxd282xxx  has
a similar side effect profile as those of the other  xxxd2579xxx 
preparations, such as  xxxd2781xxx ,  xxxd2579xxx  and  xxxd3255xxx . in addition, there are some data available which show
fewer adverse events in patients taking  xxxd282xxx  compared
to other  xxxd2579xxx  preparations [14]. fever, rash and diarrhea are
the most common side effects. the diarrhea caused by  xxxd2579xxx 
preparations ( xxxd2781xxx  in particular) is more common at the
onset of therapy, and typically resolves in 4 – 8 weeks as the
colon adapts to the elevated fluid load [19]. according to a
recent meta-analysis comparing  xxxd3255xxx  to  xxxd282xxx 
and  xxxd2579xxx ,  xxxd282xxx  was significantly better tolerated
than  xxxd3255xxx  [20].
hypersensitivity reactions to the 5-asas can result in pancreatitis and pneumonitis. patients with a known hypersensitivity to any member of this class of medications should not
be started on another, as these responses are likely to occur
again [21]. additionally, development of acute interstitial
nephritis has been well documented, although uncommon,
with an incidence of 1 in 500 [22]. case reports suggest that
early cessation of therapy with  xxxd2579xxx  has been associated
with reversibility of this process, but prolonged treatment
may lead to irreversible renal impairment [23,24]. therefore,
all patients receiving these medications should have serum
bun and creatinine checked on a routine basis.
alopecia is another unusual side effect of  xxxd2579xxx 
which was first observed in the european crohn’s disease
study. researchers found that two women receiving 4 g/day
of  xxxd2579xxx  for the treatment of crohn’s disease experienced diffuse alopecia, which resolved after cessation of
treatment with the medication [25].
 xxxd2579xxx , and balsalizide in particular, has rarely been
associated with several cardiac complications. in a recent
case report, myocarditis was reported in a young man, which
resolved after cessation of  xxxd282xxx  [26]. there have also
been several case reports of pericarditis related to  xxxd2579xxx 
therapy in individuals with uc [27,28].
additionally,  xxxd2579xxx  has been shown to affect the
metabolism of thiopurines. a recent study by de boer et al.
demonstrated increased levels of pharmacologically active
6- xxxd3352xxx  metabolites in a dose-dependent co-administration
of  xxxd2579xxx  [29]. this increase in 6- xxxd3352xxx  may result in a
greater frequency of myelosuppression for individuals on both
 xxxd2573xxx /azathioprine and  xxxd2579xxx .
in the latest review (meta-analysis) of data regarding safety
in pregnancy, seven studies with a total of 2200 pregnant
women with irritable bowel disease (ibd) were reviewed and
the data analyzed. in these studies, 642 patients received
 xxxd2579xxx  drugs ( xxxd2579xxx ,  xxxd3255xxx  or  xxxd2781xxx ) and
1158 patients received no medication. the results demonstrated
no more than a 1.16-fold increase in congenital malformations, a 2.38-fold increase in stillbirth (p = 0.32), a 1.14-fold
increase in spontaneous abortion (p = 0.74), a 1.35-fold

expert opin. drug metab. toxicol. (2009) 5(10)

1281

 xxxd282xxx 

increase in preterm delivery (p = 0.26) and a 0.93-fold
increase in low birth weight (p = 0.96) [30]. this study was
limited by lack of information regarding the dose of  xxxd2579xxx  given. additionally, there was a case report of fetal renal
insufficiency associated with  xxxd2579xxx  in a young woman
receiving 4 g/day of  xxxd2579xxx ; a subsequent renal biopsy of
the fetus showed tubulointerstitial lesions with interstitial
fibrosis [31]. in general,  xxxd2579xxx  is thought to be safe in
pregnancy, and as such, is classified as pregnancy risk class b.

summary

 xxxd2579xxx  preparations are an established therapy for mild to moderate uc. higher doses tend to have a better response in moderate disease than lower doses. maintenance regimens should
generally consist of the dose that induced remission. long-term
use of 5-asas may be protective against the development of
colon cancer by a class specific effect rather than by induction of
mucosal healing alone. in addition, this group of medications
has a good safety record for use during pregnancy and nursing.
although potential side effects are numerous, in clinical
practice, 5-asas are well tolerated. renal function should
be monitored regularly through blood chemistries and the
medication discontinued immediately if there is any sign of
deteriorating renal function.
 xxxd282xxx  is a useful addition to our armamentarium of
5-asas for uc and may have the added benefit of fewer
adverse effects at higher doses compared to  xxxd2579xxx .

expert opinion

there are several  xxxd2579xxx  products currently available on the
market for the treatment of ibd. 5-asas are a well established
treatment for uc. they play a role in the management of
crohn’s colitis but have no role in the management of small
bowel crohn’s.  xxxd282xxx  is a  xxxd2579xxx  with demonstrated efficacy in both the induction and maintenance of remission in
uc. it may also be effective in the treatment of crohn’s colitis
but has no role in the management of small bowel crohn’s.
all  xxxd2579xxx  products currently available on the market contain the same active compound but vary in their formulation
which allows for different modes and site of delivery of this
active compound. this is an important factor to consider
when choosing a  xxxd2579xxx  product for the patient with ibd. in
addition, when a patient has an adverse reaction or intolerance

1282

to a particular  xxxd2579xxx  product, a different formulation of the
same active medication maybe tried.  xxxd282xxx  has the
advantage, over some of the other  xxxd2579xxx  products on
the market, of being released with full activity in the colon.
in addition, although it shares the class specific side effects of
its counterparts it exhibits few drug specific side effects.
 xxxd282xxx  is, therefore, a good choice as either first-line
therapy for patients with mild to moderate uc or as an extra
option for patients with intolerance to other 5-asas.
when  xxxd282xxx  is used to treat an acute flare of moderately active uc, the dose used should be 6.75 g/day. in
terms of maintenance, there is evidence to suggest that the
dose of  xxxd2579xxx  required to maintain remission is usually that
which is required to induce remission. therefore, the maintenance dose should remain the same as the induction dose
although small reductions in dosing maybe attempted once
a durable remission has been achieved.
in addition to their efficacy in healing inflammation in
colitis, there is evidence to suggest that  xxxd2579xxx  use maybe
protective against colorectal cancer in patients with uc.
this effect seems to be class specific to the 5-asas and not
simply an effect of histologic remission. this chemoprotective benefit is a good reason to continue  xxxd282xxx  in a
patient who has achieved long-term remission. the optimal
dosing for chemoprevention has not been established.
with the proliferation of biologic therapies and  xxxd371xxx  for the treatment of ibd, the long-term role for
5-asas has been debated. there is controversy regarding
‘top down’ versus ‘step up’ therapy for crohn’s disease, but
this is less important in uc because the disease is curable
with complete colectomy. initial therapy for active uc
should, therefore, be aimed at inducing and maintaining
remission in a stepwise manner. therefore, when topical
therapy fails (in the case of left sided disease) or if the disease is more extensive, oral 5-asas such as  xxxd282xxx 
remain a first-line therapy.  xxxd371xxx  should be
introduced only if 5-asas fail to induce or maintain remission.  xxxd282xxx  will, therefore, continue to be a first- or
second-line agent for the induction and maintenance of
remission in uc.
