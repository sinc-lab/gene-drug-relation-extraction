 xxxd52xxx  for rheumatoid arthritis: a cochrane
systematic review
lara j. maxwell and jasvinder a. singh

abstract. objective. to perform a systematic review of efficacy and safety of  xxxd52xxx  in patients with
rheumatoid arthritis (ra).
methods. we searched the cochrane library, medline, embase, acp journal club, and biosis
previews for randomized controlled trials (rct) comparing  xxxd52xxx  alone or in combination with
disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (dmard)/biologics to placebo or other dmard/biologics
in patients with ra. two reviewers independently assessed search results, risk of bias, and extracted data.
results. seven trials with 2908 patients were included. compared with placebo, patients with ra
treated with  xxxd52xxx  were 2.2 times more likely to achieve an american college of rheumatology
50% response (acr50) at one year (relative risk 2.21, 95% ci 1.73, 2.82) with a 21% (95% ci 16%,
27%) absolute risk difference between groups. the number needed to treat to achieve an acr50
response was 5 (95% ci 4, 7). significantly greater improvements in physical function, disease
activity, pain, and radiographic progression were noted in  xxxd52xxx -treated patients compared to
placebo. total adverse events (ae) were greater in the  xxxd52xxx  group (rr 1.05, 95% ci 1.01,
1.08). other harm outcomes were not significant, with the exception of serious infections at 12
months, which were more common in the  xxxd52xxx  group versus control group (peto odds ratio 1.91,
95% ci 1.07, 3.42). serious ae were more numerous in the  xxxd52xxx  + etanercept group versus the
placebo + etanercept group (rr 2.30, 95% ci 1.15, 4.62).
conclusion.  xxxd52xxx  seems to be efficacious and safe in the treatment of ra.  xxxd52xxx  should
not be used in combination with other biologics to treat ra. further longterm studies and postmarketing surveillance are required to assess for longer-term harms and sustained efficacy. (first

cochrane review

 xxxd52xxx  was approved by the us food and drug
administration (fda) in december 2005 for treatment of
moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (ra) in adult
patients who have not responded adequately either to oral
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (dmard; such as
methotrexate) or to the tumor-necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha)
antagonists1. it is the first biologic therapy to selectively
modulate costimulation, inhibiting t cell (t lymphocyte)
activation by binding to  xxxg396xxx  and  xxxg398xxx  (the costimulatory antigens), thereby blocking interaction with cd28 (the
costimulatory receptor)2. use of  xxxd52xxx  is associated with
reduction in joint inflammation, pain, and joint damage in
patients with active ra.
the use of biologics is limited by their high costs and
uncertainty about the adverse events. the cost for one year
of  xxxd52xxx  treatment is roughly us $22,0003 and canadian
$18,4804. the aim of this systematic review was to examine
the data from randomized controlled trials (rct) of  xxxd52xxx  to quantify its benefits and potential harms.

revised criteria for ra5. data from published and unpublished rct were
considered for inclusion with no restrictions by duration of intervention or
the dose used.

outcome measures. the co-primary outcomes were efficacy as assessed by
50% improvement in american college of rheumatology criteria
(acr50)6 and safety. an acr20/50/70 response is defined as a
20%/50%/70% improvement in tender and swollen joint counts and the
same level of improvement in 3 of the 5 following variables: patient and
physician global assessments, pain, patient assessment of functional ability
[using the stanford health assessment questionnaire (haq) or other
measures], and acute-phase reactants [erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr)
or  xxxg520xxx  (crp)]6. we assessed safety by comparing the number of total and serious adverse events; specific adverse events, including
allergic reactions, infections, serious infections, lymphoma; and withdrawals due to adverse events and all withdrawals. regulatory agency websites were also reviewed for potential longer-term adverse events.
secondary outcome measures included the following: (1) acr20 and
acr70 response criteria and individual acr criteria (as outlined above)6;
(2) radiographic progression (measured by the sharp, modified sharp, or
larsen scores)7,8; (3) disease activity score (das; scale 0–10)9, a composite index including tender and swollen joint counts, patient’s global
assessment of disease activity, and esr, or das28; (4) european league
against rheumatism (eular) response criteria10,11; (5) physical function
as measured by changes in haq or modified haq12,13 scores, proportion
achieving “minimal clinical important change” (mcid), defined as
≥ 0.2214 or ≤ 0.306; (6) health-related quality of life (hrqol) measured
by medical outcomes study short-form 36 (sf-36) physical and mental
hrqol15,16.

search methods for identification of studies and additional data. a trained
cochrane librarian searched the following electronic databases up to march
2007 and updated the search december 31, 2008: medline, embase,
acp journal club, isi web of science (biosis previews for acr and
eular abstracts) and the cochrane library, issue 1 [including the
cochrane central register of controlled trials (central), cochrane
database of systematic reviews (cdsr), database of abstracts of
reviews of effects (dare), and health technology assessments (hta)].
the reference lists of identified clinical trials and reviews were also
searched. for missing information, clarifications, and additional unpublished data, we contacted the authors of included studies and the manufacturer of  xxxd52xxx . the original search strategy was not limited by language,
year of publication, or type of publication.
for safety assessment, we searched the websites of the regulatory agencies (us food and drug administration, european medicines evaluation
agency, australian adverse drug reactions bulletin, and uk pharmacovigilance and drug safety updates) using the terms “rheumatoid arthritis,”
“ xxxd52xxx ,” and “ xxxd52xxx ” on april 1, 2009.

data collection and analysis. analyses were determined a priori and published as a cochrane library protocol16a. two reviewers independently
assessed search results (lm, js) and disagreement was resolved by consensus. data from the included trials was independently extracted by 2
reviewers (lm, js) and entered into review manager 5.0 (revman 5.0)17.
for missing variance measures for continuous outcomes, we obtained additional data from the authors and bristol-myers squibb.
using a structured data extraction form, we obtained study characteristics, study population characteristics, intervention characteristics, outcome
measures, and results for the intention-to-treat (itt) population (if reported).

assessment of methodological quality. the risk of bias of the included studies was assessed by 2 independent reviewers (lm, js), as recommended by
the cochrane handbook18, examining the domains of randomization
sequence generation, allocation sequence concealment, blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data (prima-

ry outcome data reporting, dropout rates and reasons for withdrawal, appropriate imputation of missing data, an overall completion rate ≥ 80%), and
selective outcome reporting and other potential threats to validity (considering external validity, e.g., relevant use of cointerventions, bias due to
funding source). each criterion was explicitly judged as follows: yes = low
risk of bias; no = high risk of bias; unclear = either lack of information or
uncertainty about potential for bias.

statistical analysis. for the main analyses, we compared  xxxd52xxx  (10
mg/kg and 2 mg/kg combined) + dmard or biologics versus placebo +
dmard or biologics.
when data were sufficiently homogeneous, both clinically and statistically, we performed a metaanalysis. we calculated the mean difference
(md) or standardized mean difference (smd) for the continuous outcomes,
depending on similarity of scales measuring an outcome. for the dichotomous data, we calculated the relative risk (rr), or in the case of rare events
(< 10%; i.e., death), peto odds ratio (peto or) was used.
heterogeneity of data was assessed by 3 methods: (1) visually by examining the forest plots; and formally tested using (2) the chi-square, with a p
value < 0.10 indicating significant heterogeneity, and (3) the i2 statistic19,
with values > 50% indicating substantial heterogeneity. when substantial
heterogeneity was detected, we explored the data further by performing
subgroup analyses, in an attempt to explain the heterogeneity.
we used a fixed-effects model (specified a priori), since  xxxd52xxx  is a
new biologic and we expected that rct would have been performed in
similar populations with little “between-study” variation. in cases where
significant heterogeneity was found and could not be explained, a randomeffects model was used. we assessed the possibility of publication bias
using a funnel plot.
we assessed results separately by dose, disease duration, and prior
dmard failure planned a priori. in response to concerns found in an rct
of  xxxd52xxx  in combination with etanercept20, we undertook a post-hoc
analysis to assess the effect of harms in patients on a background therapy
of biologic treatment.
we performed the following sensitivity analyses (specified a priori) in
order to explore effect size differences and the robustness of conclusions:
(1) effect of study quality, defined as adequate allocation concealment and
outcome assessor blinding; and (2) effect of imputation of missing data or
statistical transformations. we calculated the number needed to treat (nnt)
from the control group event rate, and the relative risk was calculated using
the visual rx nnt calculator21. for continuous outcomes, the nnt was
calculated using the wells calculator software available at the cochrane
musculoskeletal group editorial office.

results
figure 1 shows a diagram of the search results. twelve articles corresponding to the following 7 clinical trials met the
inclusion criteria: genovese 200522; kremer 200323;
kremer 200624; moreland 200225; weinblatt 200626;
weinblatt 200720; and schiff 200827. the remaining 5
publications reported additional outcomes from the main
trials: kremer 200527a, emery 200628, russell 200729,
westhovens 200630, and cole 200831. all trials except
moreland 200225 and schiff 200827 reported a randomization ratio of 2:1 for treatment to control. moreland 200225
had 6 treatment arms and one placebo. schiff 200827 had 2
treatment arms ( xxxd52xxx  or infliximab) and one placebo
(randomized 3:3:2 to  xxxd52xxx , infliximab, and placebo).
the study characteristics are presented in table 1. a summary of findings (table 2) shows key outcomes. the results
of the search of pharmacovigilance websites is summarized

figure 1. selection of studies for this systematic review.

seven trials with 2908 patients were included in this
analysis. most were multicenter, international rct.
altogether 1863 patients were randomized to  xxxd52xxx  and
1045 to placebo. the majority of patients were white
women with mean age in mid-50s (range 48.3–55.8 yrs in
the control group) with active ra despite treatment with
dmard23,24,27, anti-tnf therapy20,22, or dmard or biologics25,26. the average ra disease duration was between 8
and 13 years, except in one study where it was only 3.4
years25.
 xxxd52xxx  was administered intravenously in all trials.
most trials used a dosage of  xxxd52xxx  of 10 mg/kg +
dmard with 3 exceptions: in moreland 200225, 2 mg/kg
dose was also used and no concurrent dmard use was
allowed; in weinblatt 200720, only 2 mg/kg dose was used
and patients also received etanercept; and in kremer 200323,
2 doses were used (2 and 10 mg/kg). schiff 200827 had 2
treatment arms ( xxxd52xxx  or infliximab) and one placebo
arm. trial duration ranged from 85 days to 12 months. all
trials were sponsored by bristol-myers squibb, the manufacturer of  xxxd52xxx .
the risk of bias for each included study is summarized in
figure 2 (additional details available from the author upon
request). for the primary outcome acr50 response, the
studies included in the metaanalysis rate well in terms of
236

adequate allocation concealment, blinding, and reporting of
appropriate outcomes. however, there is a concern of bias in
terms of incomplete outcome data given the high dropout
rate in 2 studies20,23, and that 2 studies excluded participants
from efficacy analyses, but included them in safety analyses24,26. all studies were sponsored by the manufacturer of
 xxxd52xxx  and it is known that industry-sponsored trials may
overestimate the treatment effect32.
primary outcomes.  xxxd52xxx  was associated with significantly higher likelihood of achieving acr50 compared to
placebo at 6 and 12 months, but not at 3 months (only one
study) with rr of 2.47 (95% ci 2.00, 3.07), 2.21 (95% ci
1.73, 2.82), and 2.50 (95% ci 0.52, 11.96), respectively
(figure 3). the moderate heterogeneity for 6-month results
(i2 = 44%, p = 0.13) decreased when analyses were performed by excluding the weinblatt 2007 trial20, which was
the only trial to use  xxxd52xxx  2 mg/kg in combination with
etanercept and not statistically significant; however, the
pooled rr changed minimally, to 2.59 (95% ci 2.07, 3.25).
for the acr50 response, there was an absolute difference of
21% (95% ci 16%, 27%; table 2). the nnt to achieve an
acr50 response at 1 year was 5 (95% ci 4 to 7).
we found that the total number of adverse events was
significantly greater in the  xxxd52xxx  group compared to
placebo but the relative risk was low (rr 1.05, 95% ci 1.01,

infections at 12 months in the  xxxd52xxx -treated group (peto
or 1.91, 95% ci 1.07, 3.42; figure 4b). this analysis
included the weinblatt 2007 trial20 in which  xxxd52xxx  was
given in combination with etanercept. removing this study
resulted in a lower or, which was just statistically significant (peto or 1.82, 95% ci 1.00, 3.32). total withdrawals
favored the  xxxd52xxx -treated group (rr 0.60, 95% ci 0.52,
0.70). numbers of total serious adverse events, withdrawals
due to adverse events, serious infections, upper respiratory
infections, cough, nausea, malignancies, and mortality were
not statistically significantly different between the treatment
and control groups, based on pooled results at 6 and 12
months. there was a higher number of headaches and infusion reactions reported in the  xxxd52xxx  group (details available from the author upon request). we undertook a post hoc
analysis to assess the effect of harms in patients on a background therapy of biologic treatment (for both 2 mg and 10
mg/kg doses) compared to placebo. the rr of total serious

the  xxxd52xxx  label information highlighted the increase in serious infections, lymphoma, and lung cancer in
patients taking  xxxd52xxx  compared to placebo. label also included warning about using  xxxd52xxx  concurrently
with anti-tnf therapy. no significant benefit in terms of efficacy was found with concurrent therapy and the
concerns about an increase in infections and serious infections warranted a warning that  xxxd52xxx  should not
be administered to patients on concurrent anti-tnf therapy
the european public assessment report’s scientific discussion report39 highlighted signals of a possible
increased risk for infection and autoimmune disorders that will need to be further investigated as well as
malignancies, given  xxxd52xxx ’s mechanism of action. the report concluded that ongoing pharmacovigilance is
needed to address concerns about “potential rare and unexpected severe adverse effects of  xxxd52xxx ”

 xxxd52xxx  group and a 0.27 change in the placebo group for
the erosion score. due to missing variance, using an approximation, there was a statistically significant mean difference
in favor of  xxxd52xxx  (mean difference –0.27, 95% ci –0.42,
–0.12).
the acr core components — patient global assessment,
physician global assessment, physical function, tender joint
count, and swollen joint count — were all statistically significant in favor of  xxxd52xxx . patient-reported pain was significantly reduced in the  xxxd52xxx  group compared to placebo22-26 (table 2).
the  xxxd52xxx  group was significantly more likely to
reach a low disease activity state (das28 < 3.2, scale 0–10)
at 6 and 12 months, with rr of 3.36 (95% ci 2.28, 4.96)
and 4.33 (95% ci 2.84, 6.59), respectively (table 2). at 12
months, there was an absolute difference of 33% (95% ci
26%, 39%) in achievement of a low disease activity state
(das28 < 3.2) between  xxxd52xxx  and placebo; the corresponding nnt was 4 (95% ci 3 to 5). those in the  xxxd52xxx  group were significantly more likely to achieve disease
remission (defined as das28 < 2.6) at 12 months, with rr
12.74 (95% ci 4.76, 34.15).
clinically meaningful improvement in physical function
on the haq (> 0.22 or > 0.3 increase from baseline; results
similar regardless of the definition used) was noted in significantly more  xxxd52xxx -treated than placebo patients at 6
and 12 months, with rr of 1.73 (95% ci 1.41, 2.13) and
1.62 (95% ci 1.35, 1.95), respectively (table 2). the
absolute risk difference of clinically meaningful improvement in haq (> 0.3) was 24% (95% ci 16%, 32%) at 12
months in favor of  xxxd52xxx . the nnt to achieve a haq >
0.3 response at 1 year was 5 (95% ci 4 to 7).
a significantly greater proportion of patients in the  xxxd52xxx  group than in the placebo group reported “better”
scores on the physical (pcs) and mental component summary (mcs) scores, with pooled rr of 1.90 (95% ci 1.52,

2.39) and 1.42 (95% ci 1.15, 1.76), respectively. in the only
study reporting this outcome, a significantly greater proportion of the  xxxd52xxx -treated group compared to placebo
achieved the sf-36 pcs population norms at 6 months, with
rr 2.36 (95% ci 1.34, 4.14)22. on the continuous scale, the
pooled mean difference in pcs and mcs scores was statistically significant in favor of  xxxd52xxx  at 4.29 (95% ci 3.22,
5.35) and 2.72 (95% ci 1.57, 3.87). [other outcomes are
available from the author upon request.]
subgroup analyses. eligibility criteria: trials were grouped
according to whether eligibility criteria for the trial required
patients to be inadequate responders to methotrexate/
dmard23,24,27, inadequate responders to anti-tnf-alpha
drugs20,22, or both25,26. an acr20/50/70 response was significant in the  xxxd52xxx  group compared to placebo in both
inadequate responders to methotrexate and inadequate
responders to biologic therapy. however, the pooled analysis of the acr50 response in the biologic failure group had
high heterogeneity, most likely due to the pooling of trials
using different interventions ( xxxd52xxx  + dmard22 compared to  xxxd52xxx  + etanercept20).

dose: there were no major changes to the relative risks
once the 2 mg/kg dose was removed from the analysis of the
combined dose. the 2 mg/kg dose was given in combination
with etanercept and it was not statistically significant at any
timepoint.
disease duration: all studies except moreland 200225
enrolled patients with a disease duration greater than 8
years. as moreland 200225 was a pilot study that provided
only 3-month data, this subgroup analysis was not undertaken.
effect of study quality: all studies except schiff 2008
(unclear allocation concealment)27 reported adequate allocation concealment and blinding. excluding schiff 200827
from the acr50 response at 6 months did not change the
result significantly: with schiff 2008, acr50 rr 2.47 (95%
ci 2.00, 3.07) and excluding schiff 2008 acr50, rr 2.62
(95% ci 2.05, 3.37).
publication bias. publication bias was assessed using a
funnel plot of the acr50 response at 6 months (details
available from the author upon request). with inclusion of
only 5 trials, there does not appear to be evidence of pub-

discussion
in this cochrane systematic review of 7 rct of  xxxd52xxx 
including 2908 patients with ra (1863 treated with abata-

cept; 1045 treated with placebo), we examined the efficacy
and short-term safety of  xxxd52xxx  alone or in combination
with dmard/biologics compared to placebo alone or in
combination with dmard/biologics.  xxxd52xxx  was 1.7 to
4 times more efficacious than placebo in achieving an
acr20, acr50, and acr70 response at 12 months. in
terms of the absolute risk difference between treated and
control groups, the acr50 at 12 months had a 21% absolute
difference (95% ci 16% to 27%). the number needed to
treat (nnt) in order to achieve an acr50 response at one
year was 5 (95% ci 4 to 7). this nnt is similar to nnt of
3.0 (95% ci 2.0 to 6.0) found in a systematic review of
another biologic agent, adalimumab, an anti-tnf-alpha
inhibitor, in patients with moderate to severe disease and failure to previous dmard33.  xxxd52xxx -treated patients were
3.4 to 4.3 times more likely to achieve a low disease activity
state. one rct24 demonstrated that at 12 months  xxxd52xxx 
statistically significantly slowed the progression of structural joint damage compared with placebo, although the clinical
significance of this result is not known. the acr20, acr50,
and acr70 responses in the original  xxxd52xxx  group at one
year were similar to those at 2 years: 81.9% and 80.3%;
54.0% and 55.6%; 32.4% and 34.3%, respectively34.
radiographic progression, disease activity (measured by
das28), physical function (measured by haq-damage
index), and hrqol (measured by sf-36) outcome
responses were also maintained at 2 years35. thus, it appears
that response to  xxxd52xxx  therapy is well maintained.
the efficacy must be balanced by assessment of safety.
numbers of adverse events and serious infections were significantly greater in the  xxxd52xxx  group compared to placebo group but the totals of serious adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, upper respiratory infections,
malignancies, and mortality were not statistically significantly different. this may be due to small sample size36,37
and short followup duration. the fda website highlighted
the increase in serious infections, lymphoma, and lung cancer in patients taking  xxxd52xxx  compared to placebo38, similar to the european public assessment report’s scientific
discussion document on  xxxd52xxx  describing possible
increased risk for infection and autoimmune disorders39.
the fda label included a warning against using  xxxd52xxx 
concurrently with anti-tnf therapy and the european
medicines agency suggested that risk of malignancies
needs further investigation (table 3).
with the current evidence of its superiority to placebo,
head-to-head comparator trials of  xxxd52xxx  with other
dmard/biologics, such as tnf inhibitors and others, may
help us better understand its role in ra treatment40. this
information will also assist patients and physicians in making more informed choices.
two recent reviews of  xxxd52xxx  described the outcomes
from phase ii and iii trials, but did not perform metaanalyses41,42. in a recent metaanalysis of rct to investigate the

risk of serious infections in use of rituximab, anakinra, and
 xxxd52xxx  for ra, salliot, et al reported no significant
increase in risk of serious infection with the use of  xxxd52xxx 
in 5 trials with a pooled mantel-haenszel or of 1.35 (95%
ci 0.78 to 2.32)43. similarly, we found no significant
increase in serious infections with peto or of 1.56 (95% ci
0.93 to 2.61), when 6 and 12-month results were pooled.
however, the pooled 12-month results of 3 trials did show
statistically significantly higher odds of serious infections in
the  xxxd52xxx  versus placebo-treated patients (peto or 1.91,
95% ci 1.07 to 3.42).
a subgroup analysis based on eligibility criteria of an
inadequate response to dmard therapy versus an inadequate response to anti-tnf therapy found that in both
groups  xxxd52xxx  produced a statistically significant acr50
response compared to placebo at 6 months. the group with
an inadequate response to anti-tnf therapy had a slightly
higher relative risk for an acr50 response at 6 months than
those with an inadequate response to dmard therapy, but
the difference between the 2 groups was not significant.
therefore, based on placebo-controlled trials of up to one
year duration, it appears that  xxxd52xxx  is efficacious in
improving signs and symptoms of patients with active, moderate to severe ra who have failed either dmard or
anti-tnf therapy.
study strengths. for this review a systematic literature
search was performed; 2 reviewers reviewed abstracts independently, extracted data independently, and resolved disagreements with consensus. we obtained additional information from the authors and bristol-myers squibb, and
specified analyses a priori in a published protocol16a.
study limitations. we were limited in our ability to perform
metaanalysis due to lack of reporting of variance measures,
to assess risk of bias due to missing details, and to uniformly analyze adverse events due to use of different systems
(meddra version 7 versus version 8 versus a specified list)
— all limitations of the included studies. due to lack of
rct of  xxxd52xxx  in patients with early ra, its efficacy in
early ra is unknown. pooling the trials with 2 mg/kg and 10
mg/kg dosages of  xxxd52xxx , which was done to increase the
sample size, may have led to slight underestimation of
adverse events than if we had included only data for the 10
mg/kg dosage. at best, rct provide estimates of short-term
safety; long-duration observational and postmarketing surveillance studies are needed for the assessment of intermediate to longterm safety to detect uncommon, rare
adverse events. methodological quality was good in general, with a few exceptions: < 80% completion rates in the
treatment group in 2 studies20,23, and only 3 out of 7 trials
reported a proper intention-to-treat analysis.
we conclude that there is “moderate” level evidence for
short-term efficacy of  xxxd52xxx  compared to placebo in
improving disease activity and state, physical function, and
hrqol.  xxxd52xxx  appears safe for short-term use. there is

no efficacy benefit of combining  xxxd52xxx  with an
anti-tnf biologic, which leads to higher risks. further
trials/studies are needed to determine its longterm safety
profile and to assess whether the level of efficacy found in
the rct included in our review is sustained over time.
