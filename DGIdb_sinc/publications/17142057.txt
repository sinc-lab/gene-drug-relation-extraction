abstract
serine hydroxymethyltransferase ( xxxg2069xxx ) catalyzes the inter conversion of serine and tetrahydrofolate (h4-folate) to form glycine and
5,10-methylene h4-folate and generates one-carbon fragments for the synthesis of nucleotides, methionine, thymidylate, choline, etc. in
spite of being an indispensable enzyme of the thymidylate cycle,  xxxg2069xxx  in leishmania donovani remains uncharacterized. the study of l.
donovani  xxxg2069xxx  (ldshmt) becomes important as this gene is preferentially expressed in the amastigote stage of parasite, which resides in
human macrophages. here we report cloning, expression and puriwcation of a catalytically active ldshmt. the homogeneity of recombinant protein was analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis and protein was found to be 95% pure having yield of 1 mg/l. the recombinant protein is a tetramer of 216 kda as evidenced by gel wltration chromatography and uses serine and tetrahydrofolate as substrates
with km of 1.6 and 2.4 mm, respectively. further biochemical studies revealed that ph optimum of ldshmt is 7.8 and enzyme is thermally stable up to 45 °c. ldshmt was found sensitive towards denaturants as manifested by loss of enzyme activity at the concentration
of 1 m urea or 0.25 m guanidine hydrochloride. this is the wrst report of puriwcation and characterization of recombinant  xxxg2069xxx  from
any protozoan source. studies on recombinant ldshmt will help in evaluating this enzyme as potential drug target.

the leishmaniasis comprises a group of diseases with
extensive morbidity and mortality in most developing
countries. leishmania, causative agent of this parasitic disease is distributed worldwide, being endemic in 88 countries. according to the world health organization,
leishmaniasis currently avects nearly 12 million people and
there are 2 million new cases per year with growing tendency [1]. moreover, it is estimated that approximately 350
million people live at the risk of infection with leishmania
parasites [2]. leishmania/hiv co-infections have increased
in mediterranean countries, where up to 70% of potentially
fatal visceral leishmaniasis (vl)1 cases are associated with

hiv infection, and up to 9% of aids cases suver from
newly acquired or reactivated vl [3]. no evective vaccines
are available against leishmania infections as yet and treatment relies solely on chemotherapy with pentavalent antimonials as wrst-line drugs and  xxxd164xxx  and
pentamidine as second-line agents [4–6]. resistance to antimony is now observed in several parts of the world [7,8]
most notably in the state of bihar, india, where more than
50% of the patients are unresponsive to treatment, or
relapse after conventional chemotherapy [9,10]. ketoconazole, allopurinol, and miltefosine are been used as drug
against leishmania parasite as the biochemical pathways
such as the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway, the exquisite
requirements for purine salvage and high levels of ether lipids divers from its mammalian host. with the exception of
miltefosine [11], these drugs are not evective against visceral
leishmaniasis. there are reports of development of resistance against miltefosine in leishmania. [12]. recent

advancements of genome sequence of leishmania major
have provided new insight to discover new drug targets
with a view to develop novel antileishmanial drug in near
future [13].
 xxxg631xxx  (dhfr) and  xxxg2366xxx  (ts) together with serine hydroxymethyltransferase
( xxxg2069xxx ) comprise the three enzymes of the thymidylate
cycle essential for replication in virtually all organisms.
diverences in amino acids at catalytic site of these enzymes
in the host and target organism have been capitalized to
develop antibacterial and antiprotozoal agents [14,15].
with such considerable evorts being put into designing
drugs against these enzymes, it is surprising that very little
attention has been paid to the inhibition of  xxxg2069xxx . of the
trio of enzymes involved in the  xxxg2366xxx  cycle,
 xxxg2069xxx  is the only enzyme yet to be studied clinically as a
target for leishmanial chemotherapy.
serine hydroxymethyltransferase ( xxxg2069xxx ), a member
of the alpha class of the pyridoxal-5⬘-phosphate (plp)
dependent enzymes, is ubiquitous for generating one-carbon fragments for the synthesis of nucleotides, methionine, thymidylate, choline, etc.  xxxg2069xxx  catalyses the inter
conversion of serine and glycine with 5,6,7,8-tetra hydrofolate
(thf) serving as the one carbon acceptor. the 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate produced by  xxxg2069xxx  participates
directly in pyrimidine biosynthesis by donating a methyl
group used for methylating 2⬘- xxxd1838xxx  (dump) to 2⬘- xxxd3364xxx  monophosphate
( xxxd3365xxx ). overexpression and puriwcation of soluble
active  xxxg2069xxx  has been reported from many sources like
mammals (human, rabbit, sheep), plants (arabidopsis,
pea) and prokaryotes (escherichia coli) but puriwcation of
recombinant  xxxg2069xxx  has not been reported from any protozoan sources. the  xxxg2069xxx  activity has been described in
a number of trypanosomatid parasites which cause the
deadly diseases like chagas disease, sleeping sickness,
leishmaniasis, etc. [16,17] but overexpression and puriwcation of recombinant protein in trypanosomatids has not
been reported. recent reports showed that leishmania
contains two  xxxg2069xxx  isoforms, one present in cytosol and
another present in mitochondria which are preferentially
expressed in the amastigote stage of parasite. studies suggest that the folate metabolism in leishmania is compartmentalized. the mitochondrion may have an important
regulatory role in folate metabolism in leishmania and
this pathway divers from other kinetoplast parasites [18].
the recombinant ldshmt protein will certainly help for
further characterization.
in the present study, we cloned the ldshmt gene by
pcr ampliwcation from genomic dna of leishmania
donovani and constructed a recombinant expression vector
pqe60-ldshmt. this his-tag-fused ldshmt protein was
then expressed in e. coli, puriwed through a single step ni–
nta aynity chromatography and wnally validated by
western blot. oligomeric structure, ph optimum, thermal
stability and evect of denaturants on ldshmt are reported
here.

materials and methods
chemicals and reagents
thf, l-serine, 2- xxxd26xxx , plp, and phenylmethanesulfonyl xuoride were obtained from sigma
aldrich. restriction enzymes used for cloning were
obtained from mbi, fermentas. monoclonal his-antibody
used for western blotting was obtained from santa cruz
biotechnology. pgem-t easy cloning vector was purchased from promega. expression vector pqe60 and ni–
nta superxow were obtained from qiagen, [3-14c] serine
was obtained from amersham. all other biochemicals were
of the highest grade available.
leishmania donovani culture
the who reference strain of l. donovani (mhom/
in/80/dd8) was obtained from imperial college london
(uk) and maintained in vitro as promastigotes in high
glucose rpmi 1640, supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum containing 40 g/ml  xxxd2193xxx 
at 25 °c.
bacterial strains and plasmid vectors
ta cloning vector pgemt easy was used to clone pcr
product (ldshmt) and pqe60 vector having c terminal
his6-tag was used for expression of the recombinant protein. the recombinant plasmids were transformed in e. coli
m15 cells for expression.
construction of expression vector pqe60-ldshmt
pcr primers 5⬘-cgggatccatgatctgtcgtg
cctcgatg-3⬘ (forward) and 5⬘- cgggatccttga
atggggtaggcgctctccag-3⬘ (reverse) with
bamhi restriction sites shown as underlined were
designed based on l. major  xxxg2069xxx  gene (lmjf28.2370)
sequence. ampliwcation of  xxxg2069xxx  gene was carried out
using genomic dna of l. donovani as template using the
following reaction cycles: 1 cycle for 3 min at 95 °c, 30
cycles for 1 min at 95 °c, 1 min 30 s at 58 °c, 2 min at
72 °c and 1 cycle for 10 min at 72 °c. the ampliwed product after gel puriwcation was cloned in pgemt-easy
vector (named as pgemt-ldshmt) transformed in
e. coli dh5 competent cells. nucleotide sequencing of
pgemt-ldshmt clone was done in both directions to
conwrm the sequence of the amplicon and sequence submitted to genbank. the  xxxg2069xxx  gene in pgemt was
digested with restriction endonuclease bamhi and subcloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pqe60 to
produce the recombinant plasmid pqe60-ldshmt that
contains c-terminal his6-tag for puriwcation purpose.
the  xxxg2069xxx  gene was cloned in pqe60 vector and the
positive clones were screened for the right orientation of
the gene by restriction digestion. the xhoi site is present

in the pqe60 vector at +1 nucleotide at mcs and at 283
nucleotides from n-terminal in the  xxxg2069xxx  gene. all the
clones having the gene in the right orientation showed
two fragments of 4.5 kb and 300 bp where as clones having the gene in the wrong orientation gave two fragments
of 3.7 and 1.1 kb upon digestion with xhoi. the recombinant construct (pqe60-ldshmt) with  xxxg2069xxx  gene in the
right orientation was then taken for further expression
studies.
phylogenetic analysis and multiple sequence alignment
 xxxg2069xxx  genes of diverse species at the level of deduced

of the sample was injected into the column and run at
25 °c at a xow rate of 0.3 ml/min with detection at
280 nm.

expression and puriwcation of ldshmt
pqe60-ldshmt was transformed in e. coli strain
m15 and grown in lb media supplemented with 100 g/
ml of ampicillin and 50 g/ml of kanamycin at 25 °c.
when od600 reached 0.4–0.6, the culture was induced
with
0.1 mm
isopropyl--d-thiogalactopyranoside
(iptg) and incubated at 25 °c for an additional 12 h.
the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000g for
15 min at 4 °c and suspended in buver a (50 sodium
phosphate buver, ph 7.4 containing 500 mm nacl, 1 mm
- xxxd26xxx , 50 mm plp, 10% glycerol and
10 mm imidazole). cells were then sonicated and centrifuged at 16,000g for 45 min at 4 °c, to remove the cell
debris. supernatant was loaded on a nickel– xxxd2739xxx -superxow column pre-equilibrated with buver a.
to remove the contaminating proteins, the column was
wrst washed with buver b (50 mm sodium phosphate
buver, ph 7.4 containing 500 mm nacl, 1 mm - xxxd26xxx , 100 mm plp, 10% glycerol, and 20 mm imidazole) followed by buver c (50 mm sodium phosphate
buver, ph 7.4 containing 500 mm nacl, 1 mm - xxxd26xxx , 100 mm plp, 10% glycerol and 50 mm imidazole) and wnally eluted with buver d (50 mm sodium
phosphate buver, ph 7.4 containing 500 mm nacl, 1 mm
- xxxd26xxx , 100mm plp, 10% glycerol and
500 mm imidazole). the eluted protein was dialyzed
against buver e (20 mm sodium phosphate buver, ph 7.4
containing 100 mm na2so4, 1 mm - xxxd26xxx ,
100 mm plp and 10% glycerol). the puriwed protein was
used to perform biochemical studies.

 xxxg2069xxx  activity of the puriwed recombinant protein
was determined as reported earlier [20]. 0.1 ml reaction
mixture containing 400 mm sodium phosphate buver ph
7.8, 1.8 mm dtt, 1 mm edta, 50 mm plp, 1.8 mm tetrahydrofolate, 3.6 mm l-[3-14c]serine was incubated with
0.5 g of the recombinant protein at 37 °c for 20 min and
reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 l of dimedone (400 mm in 50% ethanol). the reaction mixture was
kept in boiling water bath for 5 min and the h-14chodimedone adduct was extracted into 3 ml of toluene. one
milliliter of the toluene extract was added to 5 ml of scintillation xuid and radioactivity was measured on scintillation counter. one unit of enzyme was dewned as the
amount of enzyme required to catalyze the formation of
1 mol of hcho/min at 37 °c. speciwc activity was
expressed as units/mg protein.
thermal stability of ldshmt
thermal stability of ldshmt was determined by measuring the residual activity after incubating the proteins at
diverent temperatures ranging from 30 to 70 °c (with interval of 5 °c) for 10 min. the samples were then cooled down
to room temperature and enzyme activity was measured as
mentioned above.
ph dependence of ldshmt activity
ph dependence of the ldshmt activity was measured in
400 mm sodium phosphate buver, ph 6.0–9.0, and enzyme
assay was performed as described above.

sds–page and western blotting
evects of denaturants on ldshmt activity
protein samples were separated by 10% sds–
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds–page) and
transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. sds–polyacrylamide gels were stained with coomassie brilliant blue
r-250. western blots were probed with monoclonal antihexahistidine antibody, following the manufacturer’s

for studying the evect of denaturants on  xxxg2069xxx  activity, the enzymatic activity was determined by measuring the
residual activity after incubating the proteins at diverent
concentrations of urea and gdmcl (1–4 m with urea and
0.1–1 m with gdmcl) for 4 h.

results and discussion
sequence analysis of ldshmt
due to unavailability of l. donovani genome sequence,
primers for ampliwcation and cloning of  xxxg2069xxx  gene were
designed on the basis of available l. major genome database as l. major genome share high similarity with l. donovani genome [38,39]. an open reading frame of 1443 base
pairs encoding 480 amino acids of ldshmt was ampliwed
from l. donovani gdna (fig. 1a). authenticity of the gene
was conwrmed by dna sequencing and the nucleotide
sequence of ldshmt was submitted in genbank under
accession no. ay189738. ldshmt coding region was
found enriched in g + c residues (61.9%) in comparison
with a + t residues (38.1%) like other leishmanial genes.
the sequence analysis of the encoded ldshmt protein
showed the presence of 55 basic amino acids (k, r) and 49
acidic amino acids (d, e). the predicted isoelectric point
(pi) of the protein was 8.85.

shmts of other organisms. the amino acid sequence were taken from
either from swissprot—bacillus subtilis (p39148), e. coli (q8xa55), l.
major (q4q828), p. falciparum (q9u638), m. tuberculosis (o53441),
mrabbit (p14519) mpotato (p50433), mpea (p34899), t. cruzi (q4d7d8),
b. stearothermophilus (q7sib6) or protein data bank mhuman (2atv).
the dendrogram is generated by clustal w by comparing the full-length
amino acid sequences of ldshmt and shmts of other organisms.

phylogenic relationship of ldshmt with shmts of
other organisms showed that shmts are mainly divided
into two groups. first group consists of prokaryotic
shmts (bacillus subtilis, bacillus stearothermophilus, m.
tuberculosis and e. coli) where as second group consists of
eukaryotic shmts. further eukaryotic shmts are sub
divided into mammalian shmts (human and rabbit),
plant  xxxg2069xxx  (pea and potato) and protozoan shmts. in
protozoan, shmts of l. donovani and l. major were found
very close to each other. trypanosoma  xxxg2069xxx  followed by
plasmodium  xxxg2069xxx  were the next closest homologues to
leishmania  xxxg2069xxx . phylogenic tree clearly indicates that
 xxxg2069xxx  is a highly conserved protein in evolution and can
be used as an evolutionary marker (fig. 1b).
expression and puriwcation of ldshmt
recombinant plasmid pqe60-ldshmt was introduced
in various e. coli strains like, m15, jm109 and xl1 blue
but it was observed that recombinant ldshmt expressed
mostly as inclusion bodies. since one of the goals of the
present work was to conwrm the correct assignment to the
gene encoding ldshmt, evorts were made to express
recombinant l. donovani  xxxg2069xxx  in its soluble, active form
avoiding unfolding and refolding protocols because they do
not always result in greater yields of biologically active proteins. many leishmania proteins are reported to be insoluble in nature and tend to form inclusion bodies upon
expression in prokaryotic hosts, e.g., methionine adenosyl
transferase ( xxxg1379xxx ) of l. donovani [21], glucose regulating
protein 94 (grp 94) of leishmania infantum [22], adenylate
kinase 2 of l. donovani [23],  xxxg548xxx  type a and b
(cpa and cpb) genes of l. infantum [24]. in practice, it is
usually worthwhile to test several diverent vector/host combinations to obtain the best possible yield of protein in its
desired form. hence a number of commercially available
strains of e. coli host cells and expression vectors were
tested in an attempt to produce ldshmt in the soluble
form. screening of experimental conditions were carried
out to obtain high yield of recombinant protein, including
growth temperature, medium type, and hours of growth
after iptg induction.
optimal heterologous expression of ldshmt having
6-his at c-terminus occurred in e. coli m15 cells after 12 h
from induction with 0.1 mm iptg at 25 °c. after electrophoresis, a heavily stained protein band (fig. 2, lane 3) was
obtained, which was virtually absent in the non-induced
cell lysate (fig. 2, lane 2). most of the protein was found in
the insoluble fraction (fig. 2, lane 4) and approximately 5%
of the recombinant ldshmt was recovered in the soluble
fraction (fig. 2, lane 6). the recombinant protein was
puriwed using ni2+–nta aynity chromatography. the
his6-tag at the c-terminus facilitated strong binding of the
protein to the ni2+–nta matrix. most of the contaminating proteins were washed away from the column with buver
b and c having 20 and 50 mm imidazole, respectively.
sds–page analysis revealed that the metal aynity

r. vatsyayan, u. roy / protein expression and puriwcation 52 (2007) 433–440

chromatography puriwed ldshmt had purity of more than
95% and having yield of 1 mg/l and migrated as a single
band of apparent molecular mass of 54 kda (fig. 2, lane 6),
which was is in good agreement with the calculated value of
53.04 kda. the speciwcity of the protein was further
validated by western blot by probing it with anti-his antibodies as the expressed protein had his6-tag attached to its
c-terminal.
determination of molecular weight and oligomeric state of
ldshmt
 xxxg2069xxx  is present as a dimer in prokaryotes like e. coli,
salmonella typhimurium, b. stearothermophilus [25–27],
whereas it occurred as a tetramer in eukaryotes like human,
rabbit, sheep, mouse, zebra wsh [28–32]. recently, it was

437

shown that the trypanosoma cruzi  xxxg2069xxx  was present as a
catalytically active monomer (55 kda) [17]. it has so far not
been possible to obtain a fully active dimeric form of the
eukaryotic enzyme either by mutation or dissociation. on
the other hand, the enzyme from prokaryotes is invariably
present as a dimer, although there is some evidence to suggest that a tetrameric form is present in the crystal structure
of the ternary complex of eshmt with gly and 5-formyl
h4-folate [15] and bsshmt [16].
puriwed recombinant ldshmt protein was subjected to
size exclusion chromatography on pharmacia superdex200 (fig. 3). the protein migration was compared with
standard molecular weight markers which suggested that
ldshmt recombinant protein exists as a tetramer as
observed for other eukaryotic shmts but divers from
t. cruzi  xxxg2069xxx  which exist as monomer [33].

to demonstrate that the overexpressed recombinant
ldshmt protein actually has shtm activity, the conventional radioactive assay was performed using puriwed
recombinant ldshmt protein. the ph dependence, thermal stability, and evect of denaturants (urea and gdmcl)
were studied on recombinant ldshmt protein.
like most other shmts, ldshmt showed activity in
alkaline ph [33,17]. the ph optimum for the ldshmt was
observed as 7.8 which was a little lower as compared to crithidia and trypanosoma  xxxg2069xxx , the other member of the
same family having ph optimum of 8.2 [33,17]. the enzyme
retained more than 50% of the activity at ph 9 (fig. 4a).
thermal stability of  xxxg2069xxx  varies in diverent organisms.
the  xxxg2069xxx  may be stable up to 80 °c in b. stearothermophilus [35] and 40 °c in hyphomicrobium methylovorum [36],
ldshmt showed thermal stability up to 45 °c where it
exhibited 85% activity (fig. 4b). ldshmt was found to be
temperature sensitive as compared to sheep  xxxg2069xxx  [37] as
it lost its activity at 65 °c.

fig. 4. evect of ph, temperature and denaturants on ldshmt activity. (a) ph-induced changes in ldshmt activity were observed by measuring enzyme
activity in phosphate buver ranging from ph 6–9. (b) evect of temperature on enzyme activity was observed by measuring residual activity after incubating the enzyme at diverent temperatures (30–70 °c for 10 min). (c,d) the evect of denaturants (urea and gdmcl) on the enzymatic activity. residual
activity was measured after incubating the enzyme at diverent concentration of urea and gdmcl.

the evect of denaturants like urea and gdmcl on
ldshmt was assessed by incubating the enzyme at diverent
concentrations of denaturants. ldshmt was found to be
more sensitive to gdmcl in comparison with urea. the
enzyme lost 81% and 86% of its activity at a concentration
of 1 m urea and 0.25 m gdmcl, respectively (figs. 4 c&
d). the reason for the loss in activity at even lower concentration of denaturants may be due to removal of plp from
the active site since plp remains loosely bound at the
active site and on addition of denaturants partial unfolding
of the enzyme occurs, which might result in the release of
plp from the active site.
the km and vmax for the substrate l-serine were 1.6 mm
and 2.7 moles/min/mg and for thf were 2.4 mm and
4 moles/min/mg, respectively, which were comparable with
other shmts. the ldshmt catalyzed the h4- folate
dependent retro aldol clevage of l-serine to form glycine
and 5, 10-ch2-h4-folate with a speciwc activity 1.79 u/mg.
compared to the speciwc activity of sheep  xxxg2069xxx  (4.2 u/
mg) and b. subtilus  xxxg2069xxx  (6.7 u/mg) [15], the value determined for ldshmt is lower but slightly higher in comparison with mycobacterium  xxxg2069xxx  (1.5 u/mg) [34].
when l-serine was used as the variable substrate, the
plot was hyperbolic (fig. 5). thf saturation patterns were
observed with two concentrations of serine (2 mm saturating or 0.2 mm non-saturating) as reported in crithidia.
when varied concentrations of thf were used at the nonsaturating concentration of serine, thf was found to be
inhibitory at concentrations above 1.5 mm (fig. 6). this
result was in agreement with crithidia  xxxg2069xxx , which also
showed thf as inhibitor at non-saturating concentration

of serine [17]. the result could be explained based on the
hypothesis that the active sites of ldshmt are not identical
and serine might have diverential binding aynities with
them. monomers in tetrameric  xxxg2069xxx  interact with each
other to diverent extents [28,29] and forms tetramer which
is actually a dimer of dimmers having four active sites. in
mouse  xxxg2069xxx  [31], all active sites of  xxxg2069xxx  are not identical

concentration of l-serine. the corresponding lineweaver–burk plots are shown in the right side.

therefore, we suggest the similar case for ldshmt. all the
active sites may diver in aynity for serine, one being saturated at low concentrations of l-serine and another at
higher concentrations of the serine.
the results presented herein represent wrst step towards
better understanding of the properties of  xxxg2069xxx  in leishmania. ldshmt is the third major enzyme of folate pathway of leishmania which has been characterized after
dhfr and ts. further studies will also help in determining the complexities of the folate metabolic pathway in
leishmania. these primary studies will help in evaluating
this enzyme as a drug target in leishmania. if substantial
diverence with human and leishmanial  xxxg2069xxx  can be
exploited then the availability of leishmanial  xxxg2069xxx  in catalytically active form should facilitate the search for antileishmanial agents directed at this enzyme. the experiments
to screen highly evective ldshmt inhibitors are ongoing.
