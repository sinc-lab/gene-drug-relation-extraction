abstract
using radioligand binding assays, we determined the equilibrium dissociation constants ž k d’s. for 37 antidepressants, three of their
metabolites ždesmethylcitalopram, desmethylsertraline, and norfluoxetine., some mood stabilizers, and assorted other compounds žsome
antiepileptics, ca2q channel antagonists, benzodiazepines, psychostimulants, antihistamines, and monoamines. for the human serotonin,
norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters. among the compounds that we tested,  xxxd2546xxx  was the most potent at the human
norepinephrine and dopamine transporters with k d’s of 0.45 " 0.03 nm and 8.1 " 0.4 nm, respectively. sertraline ž k d s 25 " 2 nm.

1. introduction
after the early work of kuhn ž1958., researchers discovered that most antidepressants were inhibitors of transporters for serotonin and norepinephrine in the presynaptic
nerve ending žglowinski and axelrod, 1964; ross and
renyi, 1969.. although blockade by antidepressants of
biogenic amine uptake into nerve endings is one of the
cornerstones of the biogenic amine hypothesis of affective
illness žmaas, 1975., the exact mechanism of action of
antidepressants in alleviating depression remains uncertain.
nonetheless, this property of antidepressants clearly relates
to some of their adverse effects and some of their drug–
drug interactions žrichelson, 1994..
re-uptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine
into nerve endings is a process that prevents overstimulation of receptors in the synapse. this process of re-uptake

occurs through the action of unique proteins that have been
molecularly cloned from several species, including human
žpacholczyk et al., 1991; ramamoorthy et al., 1993; pristupa et al., 1994; eshleman et al., 1995..
we žrichelson and pfenning, 1984; bolden-watson and
richelson, 1993. and many others že.g., see koe, 1976;
shank et al., 1987. have obtained data for the inhibitory
potency of antidepressants at blocking re-uptake into rat
brain synaptosomal preparations. however, with numerous
examples in the literature of species differences for binding of compounds to molecularly cloned proteins, including the serotonin transporter žbarker et al., 1994; barker
and blakely, 1996., we were interested to determine the
binding potencies of antidepressants and related compounds for the human serotonin, norepinephrine, and
dopamine transporters and to compare these data with our
previously obtained data using rat brain synaptosomal
preparations. the results, which include some interesting
differences from our previous data žrichelson and pfenning, 1984; bolden-watson and richelson, 1993., are
presented here.

2.2. methods
2.2.1. expression of the human transporters
in this study, we directionally ligated the human serotonin transporter cdna into the expression vector
prcrcmv and transfected it into hek293 žhuman embryonic kidney. cells by the ca2q phosphate method žchen
and okayama, 1987.. for the expression of the human
 xxxg2149xxx , we directionally ligated the human
 xxxg2149xxx  cdna into the expression vector
pcdna3 and transfected it into hek293 cells, also by the
ca2q phosphate method. all cell lines used were stably
transfected.

2.2.2. cell culture
our cell lines were grown, passaged, and harvested in
150 mm petri dishes with 17.5 ml of dulbecco’s modified
eagle’s medium žmediatech, herndon, va. containing 0.1
mm nonessential amino acid solution for mem žmediatech., 5% žvrv. fetal clonebovine serum product žhyclone
laboratories, logan, ut., and 1 urm l penicillin and
streptomycin solution žmediatech.. they were incubated
in 10% co 2 , 90% air at 378c and 100% humidity. the
selecting antibiotic  xxxd2191xxx  sulfate ž250 m grml. was
used continuously for cell culture of cells expressing the
 xxxg2148xxx .
2.2.3. membranal preparations
for the preparation of the homogenates, medium was
removed by aspiration. the cells were washed with 4 ml
modified puck’s d1 solution žsolution 1. žpfenning and
richelson, 1990. and the cells were then incubated for 5
min at 378c in 10 ml solution 1 and 100 mm ethylene
glycol-bisž b-aminoethyl ether. n, n, n x , n x-tetraacetic acid
žegta.. afterwards cells were removed from the surface
by scraping with a rubber spatula, placed in a centrifuge
tube, and collected by centrifugation at 110 = g for 5 min
at 48c. the supernatants were decanted. the pellets were
resuspended in the respective binding assay buffer by use
of a polytron žbrinkmann instruments, westbury, ny. for
10 s at setting 6. the mixture was then centrifuged at
35600= g for 10 min at 48c. the pellets were suspended
in the same volume of the respective buffer and the
centrifugation was repeated. the supernatants were decanted and the final pellets were suspended in the respective buffer and stored at y808c until assayed. the final
protein concentration was determined by lowry assay
žlowry et al., 1951., using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a
standard.
2.2.4. radioligand binding assays
2.2.4.1. [3 h ]imipramine binding to human serotonin

2.2.4.2. [3 h ]nisoxetine binding to human norepinephrine
transporter. radioligand binding assays were performed
by a modification of the method of jayanthi et al. ž1993..
binding buffer contained 50 mm tris, 300 mm nacl and
5 mm kcl žph 7.4.. w3 hxnisoxetine at 0.5 nm was incubated with competing drugs and 25 m grtube membranal
protein for 60 min at 228c. nonspecific binding was
determined in the presence of 1 m m nisoxetine. the
remainder of the assay was exactly as described above
section 2.2.4.1.
2.2.4.3. [3 h ]win35428 binding to human dopamine
transporter. radioligand binding assays were performed
by a modification of the method of pristupa et al. ž1994..
this modification included the use of a binding buffer
containing 50 mm tris and 120 mm nacl žph7.4. žmadras
et al., 1989.. w3 hxwin35428 at 1 nm was incubated with
competing drugs and 30 m grtube membranal protein for
120 min at 48c. nonspecific binding was determined in the
presence of 10 m m win35428. the remainder of the
assay was exactly as described above section 2.2.4.1.
2.2.5. analysis of data
we analyzed the data by using the ligand program
žmunson and rodbard, 1980. to provide values for the
equilibrium dissociation constants ž k d ’s.. the program
has been modified by us to calculate the hill coefficients
ž n h .. data are presented as geometric mean " sem žde
lean et al., 1982; fleming et al., 1972. of at least 3
independent experiments. one- and two-component models were compared using the root mean square error of
each fit and the f-test. we did simple regression analyses
to compare between the p k d ’s of the human monoamine
transporters and the p k i’s of the rat monoamine transporters for antidepressants žexcept mirtazapine, žq.mirtazapine, žy .-mirtazapine, desmethylcitalopram,
phenelzine, iproniazid and tranylcypromine. with the use
of statview software žjandel co., san rafael, ca..

3. results
the data are summarized in tables 1 and 2. the k d ’s
for antidepressants and related compounds in this study
were derived from competition experiments with varying
concentrations of the compounds. hill coefficients ž n h ’s.
for all of the compounds at each binding site were close to
unity ždata not shown., suggesting that the binding of the
drugs in the radioligand binding assay obeyed the law of
mass action.
for imipramine the k d and n h were 1.40 " 0.03 nm
and 0.980 " 0.004 ž n s 51., respectively; for nisoxetine,
1.85 " 0.03 nm and 0.950 " 0.003 ž n s 43., respectively;
and for win35428, 24.0 " 0.4 nm and 0.930 " 0.003
ž n s 42., respectively. a one-component binding model

251

was statistically preferred over a two-component model for
each radioligand at its respective  xxxg2099xxx .
3.1. antidepressants and the human serotonin transporter
(table 1)
among the antidepressants that we tested, paroxetine,
which is a serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitor based on
animal data, was the most potent for the human serotonin
transporter with a k d s 0.13 " 0.01 nm. some tricyclic
antidepressants žclomipramine, imipramine and amitriptyline., as well as some other antidepressants žsertraline,
fluoxetine, citalopram and fluvoxamine. and some of their
metabolites žnorfluoxetine, desmethylsertraline and
desmethylcitalopram. were also very potent at the human
serotonin transporter. the tetracyclic antidepressants
žmaprotiline, oxaprotiline,  xxxd2637xxx  and mirtazapine. and
the  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors žphenelzine, iproniazid
and tranylcypromine. were very weak or had no detectable
affinity for the human serotonin transporter. for 33 antidepressants there was a significant correlation ž r s 0.93,
p - 0.0001. between the log of the k d ’s for the human
serotonin transporter žp k d . and the log of the k i’s for the
rat serotonin transporter žp k i . žbolden-watson and
richelson, 1993; richelson and pfenning, 1984.. the
equation for the regression line was p k i s 0.75 p k d q
1.20.
3.2. antidepressants and the human  xxxg2148xxx  (table 1)
at the human  xxxg2148xxx , among the
antidepressants desipramine was the most potent with a
k d s 0.83 " 0.05 nm. all the tetracyclic antidepressants,
except mirtazapine, which is a structural analog of  xxxd2637xxx , were more potent at the  xxxg2148xxx 
than at the serotonin transporter. tomoxetine, considered
from animal data to be very selective for the  xxxg2148xxx , had high affinity for the human  xxxg2148xxx  ž k d s 2.03 " 0.06 nm.. however,
at the human serotonin transporter, tomoxetine was nearly
as potent and close to that for dothiepin and venlafaxine.
venlafaxine, considered a serotonin and norepinephrine
re-uptake inhibitor based on animal data, was very weak at
the human  xxxg2148xxx . its k d value was
5 = less that than for norepinephrine. all of the serotonin
selective re-uptake inhibitors, with the exception of paroxetine, were also weak at the human  xxxg2148xxx . the k d value of paroxetine for the human  xxxg2148xxx  was 40 " 2 nm. the correlation
between the log of the k d ’s for the human serotonin
transporter žp k d . and the log of the k i’s for the rat
serotonin transporter žp k i . žbolden-watson and richelson, 1993; richelson and pfenning, 1984. was significant
ž r s 0.970, p - 0.0001. for 33 antidepressants. the equation for the regression line was p k i s 0.901 p k d q 0.999.

mentation strategy, were very weak or had no effects at the
human monoamine transporters. the ca2q channel antagonist verapamil was relatively weak at the human serotonin
transporter and very weak for both the human norepinephrine and dopamine transporters.
3.4.2. psychostimulants and related drugs
interestingly,  xxxd2546xxx  was the most potent drug at the
human  xxxg2149xxx  with a k d s 8.1 " 0.4 nm
and at the human  xxxg2148xxx  with a k d s
0.45 " 0.03 nm among all compounds we tested in this
study.  xxxd2546xxx  was 1.8 = more potent than desipramine
at the human  xxxg2148xxx . cocaine, although relatively weak, was most potent at the human
 xxxg2149xxx , compared to its binding at serotonin
and norepinephrine transporters, with k d values of 220 "
9 nm, 340 " 20 nm, and 1420 " 50 nm, respectively. the
binding affinities of žs q .-amphetamine, which were similar to those of žs q .-methamphetamine, were weak at all
monoamine transporters.
3.4.3. antihistamines
the histamine h 1 receptor antagonist chlorpheniramine
was potent for the human serotonin transporter, with a
potency ž k d s 15.2 " 0.8 nm. similar to that of the secondary amine tricyclic antidepressants desipramine ž k d s
17.6 " 0.7 nm., nortriptyline ž k d s 18 " 1 nm., and protriptyline ž k d s 19.6 " 0.5 nm..

4. discussion
this study reports the binding potencies of 37 antidepressants, three metabolites of antidepressants, some mood
stabilizers including antiepileptic drugs, two ca2q channel
antagonists, two hormones, two benzodiazepines, some
psychostimulants, antihistamines, and other monoamines
for the human serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine
transporters.
our k d value for imipramine ž k d s 1.40 nm. was
similar to that of a high-affinity binding site ž k d s 1.2
nm. reported by brust et al. ž1995. and the value ž k d s 3.2
nm. reported by barker et al. ž1994.. however, it was
nearly 30 = more potent at the human serotonin transporter, when compared to its inhibitor constant ž k i . for
inhibiting w3 hxserotonin uptake into rat brain synaptosomal
preparations in our previous studies žrichelson and pfenning, 1984; bolden-watson and richelson, 1993.. these
species differences for imipramine between human and rat
were found by blakely and colleagues žbarker et al., 1994;
barker and blakely, 1996. with binding to the molecularly
cloned serotonin transporters and by wielosz et al. ž1976.
with 5-ht uptake into platelets.
our affinity for nisoxetine at the human norepinephrine
transporter was close to that at the rat norepinephrine
transporter žtejani-butt, 1992; gehlert et al., 1995.. how-

255

ever, our k d value for win35428 was higher by about 6,
2, and 2 fold compared to the values reported by pristupa
et al. ž1994., eshleman et al. ž1995. and reith et al.
ž1996., respectively. differences in assay conditions ži.e.,
temperature of incubation and composition of the buffer.
could account for these observed differences.
some published studies on the binding of
w3 hxwin35428 to the molecularly cloned, human,
 xxxg2149xxx  show the presence of two binding
sites for this compound. for example, with membranal
preparations, pristupa et al. ž1994. describe two-sites, while
eshleman et al. ž1995. found one or two sites, depending
upon the cell type used for the expression of this protein.
in addition, reith et al. ž1996., using an intact cell assay
found two binding sites. the low-affinity binding sites for
win35428 have been in the micromolar concentration
range. however, under the conditions of our assay, we
identified only one binding site for w3 hxwin35428 and this
site was of high affinity.
the p k d ’s of 33 antidepressants for binding to the
three monoamine transporters were significantly correlated
with their respective p k i’s for uptake blockade into synaptosomal preparations of rat brain žrichelson and pfenning,
1984; bolden-watson and richelson, 1993.. these findings for the  xxxg2149xxx  are consistent with those
of eshleman et al. ž1995. and pristupa et al. ž1994..
although our correlations were significant, the equations
for the regression lines did not indicate identity of the
numbers derived by these vastly different techniques. there
could be many different reasons for this lack of identity,
including that inhibiting transport by a drug involves more
sites or processes than does binding of the drug to the
transporter.
among the drugs that are used to treat mood disorders
as augmentation and maintenance therapy, such as lithium
carbonate, most had no detectable affinity for the human
monoamine transporters. the ca2q channel antagonist verapamil, although relatively weak, was most potent among
this class of compounds at the human serotonin transporter, while very weak at both the human norepinephrine
and dopamine transporters. previously, mcgee and
schneider ž1979. and brown et al. ž1986. reported that
ca2q channel blockers had low potencies for inhibiting
uptake by monoamine transporters. estrogen, which is
used to treat women with refractory depression, was very
weak for the human monoamine transporters. however, it
would also be important to investigate interactions between antidepressants and these drugs at the monoamine
transporters.
from a perusal of the selectivity of antidepressants for
all three human monoamine transporters žtable 1., one
finds some interesting results when these are compared to
our previously reported data obtained with rat brain synaptosomal preparations žrichelson and pfenning, 1984;
bolden-watson and richelson, 1993.. although we previously reported that all tricyclic antidepressants, except

256

m. tatsumi et al.r european journal of pharmacology 340 (1997) 249–258

clomipramine, were selective for norepinephrine over serotonin, we found in the present study that in addition to
clomipramine, several other tertiary amine tricyclics, including amitriptyline and imipramine žtable 1., were serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors. nonetheless, all secondary amine tricyclic antidepressants remained selective
for norepinephrine over serotonin žtable 1.. in addition,
venlafaxine, based upon animal data, has been called a
serotonin and norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitor. however, from the present data obtained with the human
transporters, it was potent and selective for serotonin žtable 1.. therefore, it is a serotonin selective re-uptake
inhibitor.
although paroxetine was the most potent compound at
the serotonin transporter, as we previously reported for rat
brain studies žbolden-watson and richelson, 1993. and as
barker et al. ž1994. reported with the molecularly cloned
transporter, it was not the most selective. instead, citalopram was the most selective for the human serotonin
transporter. since selectivity is determined by the ratio of
k d’s for each transporter, citalopram was more selective
žcitalopram k d for serotonin transporterrk d for norepinephrine transporters 1.16 nmr4070 nm s 1r3500.
than was paroxetine ž k d for serotonin transporterrk d for
norepinephrine transporters 0.13 nmr40 nm s 1r300.,
mostly because citalopram was about 100 = weaker for
the human  xxxg2148xxx  than was paroxetine.
thus, selectivity cannot be equated with potency. in addition to selecivity, potency shoud be considered in predicting potential adverse effects or drug–drug interactions
resulting from inhibition of transporters.
fourteen antidepressants were selective for the human
 xxxg2148xxx  over the serotonin transporter
žtable 1.. oxaprotiline was the most selective compound
for the human  xxxg2148xxx . the rank order
of selectivity was the same as that which we previously
reported for rat synaptosomal studies žbolden-watson and
richelson, 1993.. all of the tetracyclic antidepressants
such as oxaprotiline, maprotiline, and  xxxd2637xxx , and some
secondary amine tricyclic antidepressants such as desipramine, protriptyline, and nortriptyline, were more selective for the human  xxxg2148xxx  than for
the human serotonin transporter. however, some secondary amine tricyclic antidepressants were more potent at
the human serotonin transporter than were some tertiary
amine drugs, such as trimipramine and  xxxd397xxx 
žbolden-watson and richelson, 1993..
 xxxd2546xxx , which is used clinically as an anorectic agent,
was the most potent drug at the human  xxxg2149xxx  among all the compounds we tested. however, it
was not selective for or most potent at this transporter,
since it was nearly 20 fold more potent at blocking the
 xxxg2148xxx  žtable 2.. both of these transporter blocking properties of  xxxd2546xxx  may explain its
appetite suppressing effects. although the rank of  xxxd2546xxx  at the  xxxg2149xxx  differs from that reported

in earlier studies by giros et al. ž1992., pristupa et al.
ž1994. and eshleman et al. ž1995., our k d value was
similar to those of giros et al. ž1992. and eshleman et al.
ž1995.. possibly, reflecting the differences in our k d
value for win35428 žas mentioned above., our k d for
cocaine was about 6, 3, and 3 = less than k i’s reported by
pristupa et al. ž1994., eshleman et al. ž1995. and reith et
al. ž1996..
the  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors žiproniazid,
phenelzine and tranylcypromine. were very weak or had
no detectable binding at the human monoamine transporters. however,  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors, which
inhibit the degradation of serotonin and other biogenic
amines, when combined with serotonin selective re-uptake
inhibitors or other drugs that potently block the serotonin
transporter, can cause a syndrome ž‘serotonergic syndrome’. that can be fatal in patients.
the tricyclic antidepressants were originally synthesized as antihistamines and, therefore, are structurally similar to antihistamines. accordingly, we determined the k d ’s
for a few antihistamines. although antihistamines are
known to block monoamine transporters žcarlsson and
lindqvist, 1969; young et al., 1988., the potency of the
antihistamine chlorpheniramine for the human serotonin
transporter was greater than expected based on the value
reported for rat brain synaptosomal studies. the clinical
relevance of this potent blockade by chlorpheniramine is
uncertain. however, the possibility exists that chlorpheniramine may cause the ‘serotonergic syndrome’, if combined with  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors.
interestingly, sertraline,  xxxd2746xxx , and sertraline’s
metabolite desmethylsertraline were the most potent among
the antidepressants that we tested at the human dopamine
transporter. in fact, these compounds were more potent
than cocaine at blocking this transporter. these results are
similar to those reported previously for rat brain synaptosomal re-uptake žbolden-watson and richelson, 1993..
the structural similarity between sertraline and  xxxd2746xxx  žfig. 1. may explain this common property. some of
the common, possible clinical consequences of blocking
dopamine re-uptake are decreased appetite, increased alertness, and insomnia. the clinical relevance of sertraline’s
blockade of the  xxxg2149xxx  is uncertain. however, this property may explain sertraline’s significant

 xxxg2149xxx .

improvement of cognitive function over fluoxetine in a
group of depressed older patients žoxman, 1996.. fluoxetine is about as potent as sertraline at binding to the
serotonin and norepinephrine transporters, but over 100
fold weaker at binding to the  xxxg2149xxx  žtable
1..
with neurotransmission, monoamines are released into
their respective synapses to activate their postsynaptic and
presynaptic receptors. in addition, diffusion beyond the
synapse leads to activation of cells far distant from the
synapse žagnati et al., 1995.. after release these neurotransmitters in the synapse can be taken back into the
nerve ending by their respective transporters, thereby reducing synaptic levels of chemical messengers and preventing overstimulation of their receptors. the inhibition
by antidepressants of monoamine transporters increases
synaptic levels of monoamines available to stimulate receptors in the synapse. this action by antidepressants is
one of the cornerstones of so-called biogenic amine žserotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. hypothesis of mood
disorders žmaas, 1975.. moreover, blockade of neurotransmitter re-uptake at the synapse by antidepressants and
related compounds can account for certain adverse effects
and drug–drug interactions. these clinical consequences
žrichelson, 1994; richelson, 1996. can be inferred from
the effects that selective drugs have in patients.
blocking the  xxxg2148xxx , for example,
may explain the antidepressant effects of drugs, their ability to cause tremors and tachycardia, and their ability to
block the antihypertensive effects of  xxxd2243xxx  and
 xxxd2242xxx . blocking the serotonin transporter may also
relate to antidepressant effects, as well as gastrointestinal
disturbances že.g., nausea., sexual dysfunction že.g., anorgasmia., and the development of the ‘serotonergic syndrome’. finally, the likely clinical consequences of blocking the re-uptake of dopamine include amelioration of the
signs and symptoms of depression, parkinsonism, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; and increased alertness. the possible adverse effects of dopamine uptake
blockade include anorexia, insomnia, and aggravation or
precipitation of psychosis. thus, the data presented can
lead to a rationale basis for understanding many of the
clinical effects of antidepressant drugs.
