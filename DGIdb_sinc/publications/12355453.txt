genetic control of  xxxg1170xxx  bioactivity through differential regulation of the  xxxd2806xxx .  regulation of il-1 bioactivity by the  xxxd2806xxx  ( xxxg1172xxx ) is critical for the preservation of normal vascular structure and function in mice. in humans, il-1 bioactivity may be further fine-tuned by genetic polymorphisms. we recently proposed that an intronic polymorphism of the human gene encoding the  xxxg1171xxx  antagonist ( xxxg1172xxx ) is a genetic risk factor for the development of chronic cardiac allograft rejection. here we aimed to establish a physiological basis for this susceptibility. plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) were obtained from 55 healthy human volunteers, whose genotypes for four polymorphisms of  xxxg1169xxx  family genes ( xxxg1170xxx ,  xxxg1171xxx  and  xxxg1172xxx ) were determined by pcr.  xxxg1170xxx  and  xxxg1172xxx  production and release in pbmc cultures were studied by flow cytometry and elisa. functional and genotypic data were pooled and analyzed first by multivariate and, subsequently, by univariate statistical tests. we were able to confirm our observed association of  xxxg1172xxx  genotype with chronic cardiac allograft rejection using multivariate statistics.  xxxg1172xxx  genotype also emerged as the principal regulator of both constitutive and stimulated  xxxg1172xxx  and  xxxg1170xxx  release. allele  xxxg1172xxx *2 was consistently associated with higher  xxxg1172xxx  and lower  xxxg1170xxx  release, in a dosage-dependent manner. conversely,  xxxg1172xxx *2 carriage was associated with reduced production of the intracellular isoform of  xxxg1172xxx . these genotypic effects were only observed with prolonged culture prior to stimulation and were not appreciably influenced by the presence of exogenous modulators of  xxxg1170xxx  production. we conclude that  xxxg1172xxx  genotype is the principal determinant of  xxxg1170xxx  bioactivity within theil1 gene cluster in humans and discuss its putative role in disease.
