abstract ergot alkaloids act as (partial) agonists or
antagonists at serotonergic, dopaminergic and alpha-adrenergic
receptors. in contrast to their affinity at serotonergic (5-ht)
and dopaminergic receptor subtypes, only limited information is available concerning their interaction with alphaadrenoceptor subtypes. this especially holds true for native
alpha-adrenoceptors. therefore, we studied the pharmacological
profile of 25 ergolines at alpha1a-, alpha1b- and alpha1d-adrenoceptors
in vascular rings or strips of rat and guinea pig endowed
with these receptors. contractile responses were studied by
measurement of isometric tension changes in rat tail artery
(alpha1a, alpha1b), guinea pig spleen (alpha1b) and rat thoracic aorta
(alpha1d). the anti-migraine drugs ergotamine and dihydroergotamine, the anti-parkinsonian drug  xxxd2498xxx  and the antihyperprolactinemic drug terguride behaved as antagonists or
low-efficacy partial agonists at all three  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptor

subtypes with nanomolar receptor affinity. derivatives of
these drugs showed lower affinity at  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptors than
the parent compounds. each individual ergoline derivative
tested showed low discriminatory capability at the subtypes,
alpha1a, alpha1b, alpha1d. a low discriminatory power between the
subtypes (alpha1a, alpha1b, alpha1d) seems to be a class effect of the
ergolines. the nanomolar affinities of ergotamine, dihydroergotamine and  xxxd2498xxx  for  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptors may affect
their effectiveness as anti-migraine and anti-parkinsonian
drugs, respectively.

introduction
from a historical perspective, the elucidation of the active
components of ergot and their complex actions played a
crucial role in the progression of modern pharmacology
(sanders-bush and mayer 2005). the pharmacological
properties of ergot alkaloids are varied and complex. these
compounds can act as (partial) agonists or antagonists at the
subtypes of serotonin (5-ht) receptors, dopamine receptors
and alpha-adrenoceptors. whereas the interaction of the ergot
alkaloids with 5-ht receptor subtypes has been extensively
studied (pertz and eich 1999 for review) and information
on the effects on dopamine receptor subtypes is available to
a certain extent (emilien et al. 1999), the interaction of
these drugs with the subtypes of  xxxg87xxx - and  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors
has been scarcely investigated.
to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that
characterises comprehensively the vascular effects of a
series of ergolines on  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha1a, alpha1b

322

and alpha1d; bylund et al. 1994). depending on their chemical
structure, we divided the ergolines under study into three
classes: (1) ergopeptines (e.g. ergotamine, dihydroergotamine
and related compounds), (2) 8alpha-aminoergolines ( xxxd2498xxx  and
related compounds) and (3) 9,10-dihydro-8alpha-aminoergolines
(terguride and related compounds; tables 1 and 2). the main
aim of the present study was to find out whether structural
modification of the ergoline skeleton of therapeutically used
drugs would be able to affect affinity and selectivity for alpha1adrenoceptor subtypes.
mediation of vascular contractility is the most important
function of  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptors. therefore, we used different

blood-vessel-based bioassays for alpha1a-, alpha1b- and alpha1dadrenoceptors to establish a functional selectivity profile
for the ergolines at native  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptor subtypes. alpha1aadrenoceptors mediate contractile responses in rat tail
artery (lachnit et al. 1997). we recently could show that
alpha1b-adrenoceptors are also present in this tissue and that
each component of contraction is separable by use of alpha1badrenoceptor alkylation and selective  xxxg85xxx 
blockade, respectively (jähnichen et al. 2004). in addition, we used the guinea pig spleen as a bioassay for the
 xxxg86xxx , as functional alpha1b-adrenoceptors are
also highly expressed in this tissue (eltze 1994). the

isolated rat thoracic aorta represents a well-established
bioassay for alpha1d-adrenoceptors (van der graaf et al.
1996). selected compounds (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, 1-allylergotamine and 1-allyldihydroergotamine)
were tested both at alpha1b-adrenoceptors of rat tail artery
and guinea pig spleen.

where (jähnichen et al. 2004). experiments using guinea pig
splenic strips were performed in the continuous presence of
propranolol (1 mum), cocaine (10 mum) and corticosterone (30
mum). experiments using rat tail arterial rings were conducted
in the presence of propranolol (1 mum), idazoxan (0.1 mum),
 xxxd2621xxx  (1 mum), cocaine (30 mum) and corticosterone
(30 mum; jähnichen et al. 2004).

materials and methods

alpha1d-adrenoceptors in rat thoracic aorta isometric contractions in response to cumulatively added na (0.3–300 nm in
0.5-log increments) in the absence and presence of an ergoline
derivative (60-min equilibration) on endothelium-denuded
rings of rat thoracic aorta were performed as previously
described (schöning et al. 2001). isometric contractions
evoked by ergotamine (0.003–10 mum in 0.5-log increments)
were performed in the absence or presence of the selective
 xxxg87xxx  antagonist bmy 7378 (0.1 mum). resting
tension before starting the concentration–response curve to
na was 10 mn. experiments were conducted in the
continuous presence of yohimbine (0.1 mum), propranolol
(1 mum), ly 53857 (3 mum), cocaine (10 mum) and corticosterone (30 mum) to block  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors, beta-adrenoceptors,
5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht)2a receptors and neuronal and
cellular uptake of na, respectively (schöning et al. 2001).

animals all experimental procedures carried out in the
present study were within the guidelines of the animals
(scientific procedures) act 1986 (http://www.archive.officialdocuments.co.uk/document/hoc/321/321-xa.htm). male wistar rats (280–430 g) and male guinea pigs (250–450 g) were
from dimed gmbh schönwalde (germany).
alpha1a-adrenoceptors in rat tail artery experiments with
cumulatively added noradrenaline (na; 0.01–100 mum) in
0.5-log increments) to evoke isometric contractions of
endothelium-denuded rings of the isolated rat tail artery in
the absence and presence (60-min equilibration) of an
ergoline derivative were performed following  xxxg85xxx  protection with b8805-033 (3 mum) and treatment
with the  xxxg86xxx   xxxd3249xxx  chloroethylclonidine (100 mum) as previously described in detail elsewhere
(jähnichen et al. 2004). resting tension before starting the
concentration–response curve to na was 7.5 mn. experiments were conducted in the continuous presence of
propranolol (1 mum), idazoxan (0.1 mum),  xxxd2621xxx  (1
mum), cocaine (30 mum) and corticosterone (30 mum) to block
beta-adrenoceptors,  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors, 5-hydroxytryptamine
(5-ht)2a receptors and neuronal and extraneuronal uptake
of na, respectively (jähnichen et al. 2004).
alpha1b-adrenoceptors in guinea pig spleen and rat tail
artery isometric contractions of guinea pig isolated splenic
strips evoked by cumulative administration of na (0.003–
100 mum in 0.5-log increments) in the absence and presence
(60-min equilibration) of an ergoline derivative were
performed as previously described (eltze 1994). resting
tension before starting the concentration–response curve to
na was 10 mn. experiments with na (0.01–100 mum in 0.5log increments) or ergots (0.003–10 mum) to evoke isometric
contractions of endothelium-denuded rings of the isolated rat
tail artery were conducted in the continuous presence of the
selective  xxxg85xxx  antagonist b8805-033 (3 mum).
resting tension was 7.5 mn. ergots which elicited contractions were studied in the absence or presence of the
irreversible  xxxg86xxx  antagonist chloroethylclonidine (100 mum, 60-min incubation). experiments with na
were performed in the absence or presence (60-min
equilibration) of an ergoline derivative as described else-

data analysis and presentation data are presented as mean
values±standard error of the mean (sem) for n experiments
using tissue from at least three animals. concentration–
response curves were fitted to the hill equation by an
iterative least-square method (graphpad prism 4.0, graphpad software, san diego, ca, usa) to provide estimates
of the maximum response emax (percentage of the maximum response to na) and the half-maximum effective
concentration pec50 (the negative logarithm of the agonist
concentration producing 50% of the maximum response).
control experiments with na were routinely performed on
each animal. antagonist affinities of silent antagonists were
expressed as either an apparent pa2 value or a full pa2
value. the apparent pa2 value was calculated from a single
concentration of antagonist using the following equation:
pa2 =−log [b]+log (r−1) where [b] is the molar concentration of the antagonist, and r the ratio of agonist ec50
determined in the presence and absence of the antagonist
(furchgott 1972). the full pa2 value was determined
according to the method of arunlakshana and schild
(1959). affinities of partial agonists (−log kp =pkp values)
were estimated according to the method of marano and
kaumann (1976) as previously described (pertz et al.
2006). student’s t test was used to assess the significance
between two mean values, with p<0.05 being considered
as significant. when more than two groups of treatments
were compared, a one-way analysis of variance was
performed.

results
the overall affinity data of the ergolines are shown in table 3.
ergopeptines
ergopeptines with an unsubstituted indole nitrogen (viz.
ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergocristine and alphaergocryptine) behaved as silent antagonists of nanomolar
affinity (pa2 values ranging from 8.0 to 8.7) in rat tail artery
under experimental conditions eliciting alpha1a-adrenoceptormediated contractions by na (fig. 1). the most potent alpha1aadrenoceptor antagonist was dihydroergotamine (pa2 8.66±
0.06). under experimental conditions, eliciting  xxxg86xxx -mediated contractions in this tissue, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergocristine and alpha-ergocryptine acted as
partial agonists of minimal efficacy (stimulant response 3–
8%; table 3). consequently, receptor affinities for these drugs
were estimated from the antagonism of the na response

325

providing partial agonist affinities (−log kp=pkp; table 3).
the contractile responses to these drugs were completely
abolished after pretreatment of the arterial tissue with the
irreversible  xxxg86xxx  antagonist chloroethylclonidine
(100 mum, data not shown). in contrast to the partial agonist
activity of ergotamine (emax 8%, pkp 7.61±0.08) and
dihydroergotamine (emax 3%, pkp 8.02±0.07) at alpha1badrenoceptors in rat tail artery, these drugs behaved as silent
 xxxg86xxx  antagonists of the contractile na response
in guinea pig spleen showing affinities comparable to those
observed in rat tail artery (ergotamine: pa2 7.52±0.04;
dihydroergotamine: pa2 7.61±0.05; fig. 2). in accordance
with the effects at rat alpha1b-adrenoceptors, ergotamine,
dihydroergotamine, ergocristine and alpha-ergocryptine were
low-efficacy  xxxg87xxx  partial agonists (stimulant
response 3–14%) in rat thoracic aorta. ergotamine-induced
contractions in rat aorta (emax 14%) were antagonised by the
selective  xxxg87xxx  antagonist bmy 7378 (0.1 mum,
not shown). the pa2 of 8.47±0.36 (n=4) was in good
agreement with that calculated for bmy 7378 against na
(8.10±0.06; n=5) in this tissue. as the stimulant responses to
dihydroergotamine, ergocristine and alpha-ergocryptine were lower
than that of ergotamine at rat alpha1d-adrenoceptors, we did not
characterise further the contractile response to these drugs.
the experimental conditions (blockade of  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors,
blockade of 5-ht2a receptors; see “materials and methods”)
argue against an involvement of receptors other than the alpha1dadrenoceptor subtype in the slight contractions induced by
dihydroergotamine, ergocristine and alpha-ergocryptine, respectively. as expected for partial agonists, these drugs antagonised the  xxxg87xxx  mediated response to na in rat
thoracic aorta; pkp values ranged from 7.5 to 7.9.
1-allylated derivatives or 6′-deoxo derivatives of ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergocristine and alpha-ergocryptine
showed lower affinities than their parent compounds at each
alpha-adrenoceptor subtype (see table 3). figure 3 shows the
effects of 1-allylergotamine and 1-allyldihydroergotamine
at alpha1d-adrenoceptors in rat thoracic aorta. it should be
emphasised that the capability of the individual ergopeptines and their derivatives to discriminate between the three
subtypes, alpha1a-, alpha1b- and alpha1d, was low (less than tenfold,
see table 3).
 xxxd2498xxx  and terguride derivatives
 xxxd2498xxx  and its derivatives with structural modification at
n(1), n(6) and of the urea substituents did not produce
contractile responses by themselves in any tissue with the
exception of didehydrometerguride (0.01–100 mum) which
elicited  xxxd3000xxx  (3 nm)-insensitive rhythmic contractions
in rat aorta.  xxxd2498xxx  and its derivatives antagonised the
contractile na response mediated by alpha1a-, alpha1b- and alpha1dadrenoceptors. the parent drug  xxxd2498xxx  was the most potent

slightly higher within this series compared to the ergopeptine or  xxxd2498xxx  series. for example, 1-methylterguride
showed a tenfold higher affinity at alpha1a-adrenoceptors
compared to alpha1b- and alpha1d-adrenoceptors. with the exception of 1-methylterguride that was equipotent with terguride
at alpha1a-adrenoceptors, derivatives of terguride were less
potent than the parent drug at any receptor subtype. the
inhibitory effects of  xxxd2498xxx  and terguride at alpha1a-, alpha1b- and
alpha1d-adrenoceptors are shown in fig. 4.

for more than 60 years. it has been proposed that
sympathetic nervous system dysfunction may be a cause
of migraine, and loss of na would lead to extracranial
vasodilatation and trigeminal activation (peroutka 2004).
as na participates in the maintenance of vascular tone
predominantly via alpha-adrenoceptors, these appear to be
involved in the pathophysiology of migraine. although the
cranio-selective vasoconstriction to ergotamine is predominantly mediated by 5-ht1b receptors and  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors,
a contribution of  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptors, albeit to a lesser extent,
has also been demonstrated (valdivia et al. 2004). it has
recently been suggested that the  xxxg86xxx  may be an
interesting target for future anti-migraine drugs, as this
receptor subtype mediates selective constriction of pathologically dilated cranial vasculature but does not play a major

affinities of the ergot derivatives at alpha1a-adrenoceptors
varied over a ~600-fold range from weak (pyrroguride) to
pronounced (dihydroergotamine). there was a ~300-fold
variability in drug affinities at alpha1b-adrenoceptors, ranging
from weak (pyrroguride) to pronounced (dihydroergotamine). variability at alpha1d-adrenoceptors was lower (∼60fold), with didehydropyrroguride showing the lowest
affinity and dihydroergotamine,  xxxd2498xxx  and terguride
showing the highest affinity. thus, dihydroergotamine
seems to be the ergoline derivative with the highest affinity
at the three subtypes of  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptors.

ergot alkaloids such as ergotamine or dihydroergotamine
have high affinity at multiple receptors, including serotonin
5-ht1a, 5-ht1b,  xxxg1110xxx , 5-ht2a, 5-ht2c, 5-ht7 and
dopamine d2 receptors (see tfelt-hansen et al. 2000 for
review). ergotamine and dihydroergotamine also display
high affinity at  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptors, but neither the species
and the experimental conditions nor the receptor subtypes
have been specified in this review. different studies have
shown that ergopeptines such as ergotamine (valdivia et al.
2004), dihydroergotamine (jourdan et al. 2007), dihydroergotoxine (roquebert and demichel 1985), ergocristine
(roquebert and demichel 1987) and dihydroergocristine
(roquebert et al. 1984) can act as partial agonists or
antagonists at  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptors. partial agonist or antagonist effects of the ergolines depend on the species, tissue
and experimental conditions. ergotamine and dihydroergotamine have been used in the acute treatment of migraine

role in the constriction of peripheral blood vessels (willems
et al. 2003). hence, although the target receptors for ergot
alkaloids in the acute treatment of migraine are known, no
information is available concerning the  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptor
subtype selectivity of these drugs. therefore, the primary
goal of this study was to find out whether the anti-migraine
drugs ergotamine and dihydroergotamine can discriminate
between  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptor subtypes in vitro.
 xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptors are widely expressed in peripheral
blood vessels, and the cardiovascular side effects of
therapeutically used ergolines can be attributed, at least in
part, to their action on these receptors. vascular responses
to this class of drugs include apparently contradictory
effects such as relaxation of constricted blood vessels and

the ergolines, either as (partial) agonists or antagonists, with
these receptors is required. evidence has been provided that
 xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptor subtype expression and function differ
with the vascular bed (rudner et al. 1999; guimarães and
moura 2001). the  xxxg87xxx  subtype shows the
strongest expression in the smooth muscle of larger
conducting arteries and seems to be responsible for
contraction and stiffening of the vessel wall (piascik et al.
1995). the  xxxg85xxx  subtype is predominant in
small arteries where it controls the peripheral resistance and
thus regulates the flow of blood and the blood pressure. on
the other hand, the  xxxg86xxx  subtype seems to play
only a minor role in the peripheral vascular contractility
(daly et al. 2002; jähnichen et al. 2004). in agreement with
these findings, the vasopressor response to the nonselective  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine has been
shown to correlate with the alpha1a- and  xxxg87xxx 
subtypes (vargas et al. 1994; zhou and vargas 1996;
willems et al. 2001). it is worth mentioning that in pithed
rats, ergotamine has recently been shown to produce shortlasting increases in diastolic blood pressure, whereas
 xxxd2498xxx  blocked the vasopressor response to phenylephrine
(centurión et al. 2006). thus, we hypothesise that ergolines
with reduced agonist activity or those with antagonist
activity at alpha1a- and  xxxg87xxx  subtypes would
provide an improved cardiovascular safety profile.
 xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptors have also been discussed to be implicated in non-cardiovascular diseases including neurodegenerative disorders (marien et al. 2004 for review). for
example,  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptor agonists were effective in reducing parkinsonian motor signs in animal models of parkinson’s disease (colpaert 1987), whereas  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptor
antagonists were unfavourable (mavridis et al. 1991). in
contrast to these observations, it has been demonstrated that
alpha1b-adrenoceptors may be directly involved in the manifestation of some forms of parkinson’s disease, and selective
 xxxg86xxx  antagonists may offer a potential new
therapeutic approach in the treatment of neurodegenerative
disorders (zuscik et al. 2000). data concerning the affinity
of anti-parkinsonian drugs with  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptor subtypes
have been presented. for example,  xxxd2498xxx  and its 9,10dihydro derivative terguride have been shown to possess
high affinity at the subtypes of  xxxg87xxx - and  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors in
competition binding assays (millan et al. 2002).
the present study shows that the anti-migraine drugs
ergotamine and dihydroergotamine are silent antagonists at
alpha1a-adrenoceptors and low-efficacy partial agonists at rat
alpha1b- and alpha1d-adrenoceptors. both drugs exhibited nanomolar
affinities at all three  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptor subtypes. it should be
noted that ergotamine and dihydroergotamine were devoid of
agonist efficacy at guinea pig alpha1b-adrenoceptors. the
apparent difference between the pharmacological properties
at rat and guinea pig alpha1b-adrenoceptors may be explained by

329

the lower signal-to-noise ratio in guinea pig isolated splenic
strips compared to rat tail arterial rings. hence, slight
contractile responses in guinea pig spleen are hardly
detectable. the anti-parkinsonian drug  xxxd2498xxx  and the antihyperprolactinemic drug terguride behaved as silent antagonists of nanomolar affinity at  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptor subtypes. the
discriminatory power between the subtypes, alpha1a, alpha1b and
alpha1d was low for ergotamine, dihydroergotamine,  xxxd2498xxx  and
terguride. similar affinities and poor discriminatory power
have previously been reported for  xxxd2498xxx  and terguride at
recombinant human alpha1a-, alpha1b- and alpha1d-adrenoceptors
(millan et al. 2002).
to demonstrate whether structural modification of the
ergoline skeleton affects affinity and selectivity for alpha1adrenoceptor subtypes, we studied the receptor profile of
a series of derivatives of the parent drugs. structural
modification of the ergoline skeleton comprised (1) alkylation of the indole nitrogen, (2) abolishment of the
cyclic tripeptide integrity of the ergopeptines, (3) variation
of the urea substituents of  xxxd2498xxx  and terguride and (4)
substitution of the n6 methyl group of terguride. all
derivatives tested showed lower affinities than their
parent compounds. alkylation of the indole n, structural
modification of the urea substituents and replacement of
the n6 methyl group lowered affinity at  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptor
subtypes. thus, the structural integrity of the ergoline
skeleton is crucial for high  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptor affinity.
interestingly, high  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptor affinity is also dependent upon the structural integrity of the cyclic tripeptide
moiety of the ergopeptines; 6′-deoxoergopeptines showed a
tenfold lower  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptor affinity compared to the
respective ergopeptine. in accordance with the parent drugs,
 xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptor subtype selectivity was poor within the
series of structurally modified ergot alkaloids. thus, ergolines fail to distinguish between the  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptor
subtypes. the low selectivity of the ergolines shows that
these compounds not only act as “dirty drugs” at 5-ht
receptors (see pertz and eich 1999 for review) but also at
 xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptors.
in conclusion, the present study shows that ergolines
which are used in the acute treatment of migraine and in
parkinson’s disease also display high affinity at alpha1adrenoceptor subtypes. the parent compounds of migraineaborting ergopeptines, ergotamine and dihydroergotamine
behaved as potent  xxxg85xxx  antagonists and potent
low-efficacy partial agonists at vascular alpha1b- and alpha1dadrenoceptors, respectively. the parent compounds of the
dopaminergic 8alpha-aminoergolines,  xxxd2498xxx  and terguride
behaved as potent antagonists at all three  xxxg87xxx -adrenoceptor
subtypes. the low discriminatory power between the subtypes seems to be a class effect of the ergolines, as the parent
drugs and each single derivative tested showed comparable
affinity at each receptor subtype. whether the high affinities

330

of ergotamine, dihydroergotamine and  xxxd2498xxx  for alpha1adrenoceptors may affect their effectiveness as anti-migraine
and anti-parkinsonian drugs remains to be established.
