abstract
 xxxd340xxx  (17-phenyl-prostaglandin f2a ethyl amide) has been reported not to exert its actions via prostaglandin receptors. here,
 xxxd340xxx  displaced [3h]prostaglandin f2a from fp receptors (ki = 6310 f 1650 nm).  xxxd340xxx  rapidly mobilized intracellular ca2 +
([ca2 + ]i) via cloned human fp receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (ec50 = 2940 f 1663 nm) and via native fp receptors
in 3t3 mouse fibroblasts (ec50 = 2200 f 670 nm). furthermore, al-8810 ((5z, 13e)-(9s,11s,15r)-9,15-dihydroxy-11-fluoro-15-(2indanyl)-16,17,18,19,20-pentanor-5,13-prostadienoic acid), an  xxxg1878xxx  antagonist, blocked the  xxxd340xxx -induced [ca2 + ]i
mobilization. d 2001 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

 xxxd340xxx , the ethyl amide of the potent prostaglandin
 xxxg1878xxx  agonist 17-phenyl-prostaglandin f2a, has
recently been marketed as lumigank for treatment of
ocular hypertension (woodward et al., 2001).  xxxd340xxx 
is reported to exert its actions via an uncharacterized
‘‘ xxxd340xxx ’’ receptor but not via any prostanoid receptors
(woodward et al., 2001). we sought to independently
characterize the pharmacological activity of  xxxd340xxx 
(and other related compounds) using radioligand binding
and intracellular ca2 + ([ca2 + ]i) mobilization assays. contrary to the previous publication (woodward et al., 2001),
we now show for the first time that  xxxd340xxx  binds to the
prostaglandin  xxxg1878xxx , and directly and rapidly activates
the fp receptors to mobilize [ca2 + ]i. in addition, we show
that an  xxxg1878xxx  antagonist can block  xxxd340xxx ’s
[ca2 + ]i mobilizing effects.
prostaglandin  xxxg1878xxx  binding was conducted on
bovine corpus luteum homogenates using [3h]prostaglandin
f2a (1 nm final; sharif et al., 1998). [ca2 + ]i was measured
in swiss 3t3 mouse fibroblasts (woodward et al., 1990;
griffin et al., 1999) and in human embryonic kidney (hek293) cells transfected with the human ocular  xxxg1878xxx 
(kunapuli et al., 1997) on a fluorometric imaging plate
reader (flipr) as previously described (jerman et al.,

2000). the sources of the reagents were: free acids of
 xxxd3414xxx  and  xxxd340xxx , and al-8810 ((5z, 13e)(9s,11s,15r)-9,15-dihydroxy-11-fluoro-15-(2-indanyl)16,17,18,19,20-pentanor-5,13-prostadienoic acid; alcon
research);  xxxd340xxx  (cayman, ann arbor, mi); lumigank (0.03%  xxxd340xxx  ophthalmic solution; allergan,
irvine, ca); ca2 + -sensitive dye kit (molecular devices,
menlo park, ca); swiss 3t3 cells from atcc (rockville,
md); hek-293 cells expressing cloned human ocular
fp receptors (dr. g. fitzgerald, university of pennsylvania); [3h]prostaglandin f2a [150 ci/mmol] from nen
(boston, ma).
[3h]prostaglandin f2a binding to fp receptors was displaced by  xxxd3414xxx  acid ((+)-fluprostenol; ki = 47 f 2 nm),
a potent and highly selective  xxxg1878xxx  agonist (sharif et
al., 1999), and by  xxxd340xxx  (cayman; ki = 6310 f 1650
nm), lumigank (ki = 4390 f 1060 nm) and  xxxd340xxx 
free acid (17-phenyl-prostaglandin f2a; ki = 83 f 2 nm)
(hill coefficients = 0.8 – 1.0; n  3).  xxxd340xxx , lumigank,  xxxd340xxx  acid and  xxxd3414xxx  acid rapidly mobilized [ca2 + ]i in swiss 3t3 cells (expressing native fp
receptors) in less than 5 s of addition to the cells (fig. 1).
these compounds yielded the following agonist potency
(ec50) and intrinsic activity (ia) values:  xxxd3414xxx  acid
ec50 = 29 f 3 nm (ia = 0.97 f 0.03);  xxxd340xxx  acid
ec50 = 39 f 7 nm (ia = 0.8 f 0.02);  xxxd340xxx  (cayman)
ec 50 = 2220 f 670 nm (ia = 0.56 f 0.05);  xxxd340xxx 
(lumigank) ec50 = 2700 f 780 nm (ia = 0.59 f 0.06)

fig. 1. intracellular ca2 + mobilization in swiss 3t3 mouse fibroblasts. the cells were loaded with the ca2 + -sensitive dye, exposed to the test compound and
the change in fluorescence measured over 180 s. top left panel (a) shows the [ca2 + ]i mobilization traces in response to  xxxd340xxx ; the top right panel (b)
shows the concentration-dependent mobilization of [ca2 + ]i by  xxxd3414xxx  acid,  xxxd340xxx  acid,  xxxd340xxx  and lumigank; the bottom panel (c) shows the
antagonism of  xxxd340xxx -induced functional response by al-8810, an  xxxg1878xxx  antagonist. the cells were pre-incubated with al-8810 for 15 min prior to
the addition of  xxxd340xxx .

(means f s.e.m., n  3; fig. 1).  xxxd340xxx  was also
an agonist at the cloned human ocular fp receptors expressed in hek-293 cells (ec 50 = 2940 f 1663 nm;
ia = 0.58 f 0.03). the effects of  xxxd340xxx  (cayman),
 xxxd340xxx  (lumigank),  xxxd340xxx  acid and  xxxd3414xxx 
acid could be blocked (e.g. ic50 less than 1 mm vs.
 xxxd340xxx ; fig. 1) by the  xxxg1878xxx -selective antagonist
al-8810 ((5z, 13e)-(9s,11s,15r)-9,15-dihydroxy-11-fluoro-15-(2-indanyl)-16,17,18,19,20-pentanor-5,13-prostadienoic acid; griffin et al., 1999). al-8810’s antagonist
potency here corresponded well with our previous observa-

tions using phosphoinositide turnover assay paradigms
(griffin et al., 1999).
in conclusion, we have shown that, contrary to the
previous publication (woodward et al., 2001),  xxxd340xxx 
from both sources (cayman and lumigank 0.03% ophthalmic solution) binds to and acts as a direct agonist at the
endogenous (mouse 3t3 cells) and cloned human ocular fp
prostaglandin receptor. this conclusion was further substantiated by the concentration-dependent antagonism of the
 xxxd340xxx -induced [ca2 + ]i mobilization by the  xxxg1878xxx  antagonist, al-8810.
