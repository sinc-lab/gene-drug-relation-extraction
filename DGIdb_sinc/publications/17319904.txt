summary. background: the mechanisms for the variability in
antiplatelet eﬀects of aspirin are unclear. immature (reticulated)
platelets may modulate the antiplatelet eﬀects of aspirin
through uninhibited cyclooxygenase (cox)-1 and cox2. objectives: to evaluate the role of reticulated platelets in
the antiplatelet eﬀects of aspirin. methods: sixty healthy
volunteers had platelet studies performed before and 24 h after
a single 325-mg dose of aspirin. platelet studies included light
transmission aggregometry;  xxxg2049xxx  and integrin aiibb3
expression, and serum thromboxane b2 (txb2) levels. reticulated platelets and platelet cox-2 expression were measured
using ﬂow cytometry. results: subjects were divided into
tertiles based on the percentage of reticulated platelets in whole
blood. baseline platelet aggregation to 1 lg ml)1 collagen, and
postaspirin aggregations to 5 lm and 20 lm adp and collagen,
were greater in the upper than in the lower tertile of reticulated
platelets. stimulated  xxxg2049xxx  and integrin aiibb3 expression
were also higher in the upper tertile both before and after
aspirin. platelet cox-2 expression was detected in 12 ± 7%
(n ¼ 10) of platelets in the upper tertile, and in 7 ± 3% (n ¼
12) of platelets in the lower two tertiles (p ¼ 0.03). postaspirin
serum txb2 levels were higher in the upper (5.5 ± 4 ng ml)1)
than in the lower tertile (3.2 ± 2.5 ng ml)1, p ¼ 0.03), and
decreased even further with ex vivo additional cox-1 and
cox-2 inhibition. the incidence of aspirin resistance (‡ 70%
platelet aggregation to 5 lm adp) was signiﬁcantly higher in
the upper tertile (45%) than in the lower tertile (5%,
p < 0.0001). conclusions: reticulated platelets are associated
with diminished antiplatelet eﬀects of aspirin and increased
aspirin resistance, possibly because of increased reactivity, and
uninhibited cox-1 and cox-2 activity.

introduction
aspirin is widely used in the primary and secondary therapy of
atherosclerotic vascular disease. aspirin inhibits formation of
the vasoconstrictor and proaggregant thromboxane a2 (txa2)
by acetylating the enzyme prostaglandin h2 synthase (cyclooxygenase isoform 1, cox-1) at residue s530 [1]. despite an
established 25% reduction in atherosclerotic events with aspirin
use [2], recent observations have highlighted wide biological
variability in the interindividual response to aspirin’s antiplatelet effects. observations have suggested associations between
diminished responses to aspirin and thromboembolic events in
a variety of clinical settings [3–5]. understanding the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon may be useful in
devising appropriate therapy for patients whose biological
response to aspirin is impaired.
immature platelets, unlike mature platelets, contain mrna
and are termed ôreticulatedõ platelets, because of the staining
patterns produced by the mrna distribution. detection of
these platelets in the circulating blood reﬂects platelet production from megakaryoctes in the bone marrow and hence the
rate of platelet turnover [6]. in parallel, increased levels of
circulating reticulated platelets have been reported in patients
presenting with syndromes characterized by pathologic arterial
thrombosis, including cerebrovascular events [7] or acute
coronary syndromes [8]. several reports also indicate that
resistance to the antithrombotic effects of aspirin is more
prevalent in patients with strokes and coronary artery disease
[5,9]. a high platelet turnover rate could theoretically produce a
population of platelets that could confer resistance to aspirin
through several different mechanisms. first, newly formed
platelets might replenish platelet cox-1, thus allowing restoration of thromboxane synthesis in platelets not previously
exposed to aspirin. a second mechanism through which
immature platelets might permit aspirin-insensitive txa2
synthesis is through uninhibited cox-2 activity. cox-2 is
expressed in juvenile platelets, and can be detected in platelets

of patients with high rates of platelet turnover [10,11]. unlike
cox-1, cox-2 is not inhibited by aspirin at oral doses of 81–
325 mg daily. although cox-2 does not ordinarily play a
major role in thromboxane synthesis, it has been shown to
contribute to txa2 generation, particularly in endothelial cells
[12–15]. we hypothesized that elevated platelet turnover, as
assessed by reticulated platelets, is associated with increased
platelet activity and diminished response to the antithrombotic
effects of aspirin. as a corollary, we also evaluated whether
uninhibited cox-1 and cox-2 contribute to thromboxane
production in aspirin-treated individuals.
methods
study design

the study was approved by the institutional review board at
baylor college of medicine, and all subjects provided informed
consent. in total, 60 healthy subjects not taking any other
medications were recruited. subjects had not taken nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs or aspirin for the preceding
2 weeks. baseline blood samples were collected from an
antecubital vein through a 21-gauge needle. after the collection
of a baseline sample, subjects ingested a single dose of 325 mg
of enteric-coated aspirin under supervision. a second blood
sample was collected after 24 h.

(fitc)-conjugated pac-1 antibody (becton dickinson, san
jose, ca, usa), and  xxxg2049xxx  expression was determined
using an r-phycoerythrin-conjugated anti- xxxg2049xxx  antibody
(bd pharmingen, san jose, ca, usa). five microliters of
citrated whole blood was diluted with 70 ll of tyrodes/bovine
 xxxg124xxx  followed by 5 ll of 20 lm adp (10 lm ﬁnal
concentration) and then by 20 ll of anti-cd62b or pac-1
antibody directed against integrin aiibb3. after incubation for
20 min, the mixture was ﬁxed with phosphate-buffered saline
(pbs) containing 1% paraformaldehyde. samples were analyzed with a coulter epics xl mcl ﬂow cytometer (beckman
coulter, miami, fl, usa). unstimulated samples served as
negative controls. both pac-1 binding and  xxxg2049xxx  were
expressed as log mean ﬂuorescence intensity (mfi) and as
percentage change in mfi from baseline to the post-aspirin
sample.
reticulated platelets

the complete blood count was measured using an automated
cell-counting machine, micros 60 (horiba ax, irvine, ca,
usa).

reticulated platelets were measured by a previously described
ﬂow cytometry assay with slight modiﬁcations [7]. five microliters of whole blood was added to a tube containing 1 ml of
thiazole orange (reticcount, becton dickinson) and another
tube with 1 ml of isoﬂo (beckman coulter) as control. after
incubation for 30 min in the dark, the tubes were spun at
1200 · g for 2.5 min to form a cellular pellet. the supernatant
was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of isoﬂo.
within 1 h, ﬂow cytometry was performed, with 5000 stained
platelets being counted in the platelet gate. the platelets
demonstrating an increase in the mfi beyond a threshold
margin set at baseline were counted as reticulated platelets and
expressed as a percentage of total platelets counted.

light transmission aggregometry (lta)

cox-2 expression

turbidimetric platelet aggregation was used to measure agonistinduced platelet aggregation. we collected 20 ml of whole
blood in 0.32% sodium citrate (ﬁnal concentration). the tubes
were centrifuged immediately at 150 · g for 6 min to prepare
platelet-rich plasma (prp). the remaining whole blood fraction
was further centrifuged at 1000 g for 15 min to separate plateletpoor plasma. the platelet count in prp was standardized
between 200 and 250 · 103 ll)1. platelet aggregation was
induced using either 5 lm or 20 lm adp, 1.5 mm arachidonic
acid (aa) or 1.0 lg ml)1 collagen (ﬁnal concentrations). the
maximum aggregation achieved during a 6-min period was used
for analysis. ôaspirin resistanceõ was deﬁned as ‡ 70% platelet
aggregation in response to 5 lm adp measured by lta, using
previously established criteria [4,9].

platelet cox-2 expression was measured in 22 subjects, using
ﬂow cytometry as previously described [17]. brieﬂy, prostaglandin i2 was added to prp and centrifuged at 1500 · g for
10 min to obtain a platelet pellet. the pellet was then
resuspended with equivalent cgs (13 mm sodium citrate,
30 mm glucose, 120 mm  xxxd3213xxx ) solution, and centrifuged again at 1500 · g for 15 min, resuspended in tyrodes
solution, and ﬁxed with paraformaldehyde 1% for 10 min. the
platelets were then permeabilized by addition of triton x-100
(0.3%) for 10 min, pelleted again at 12 000 g for 30 s, and
resuspended in equivalent 1% pbs solution. five microliters of
platelets were incubated with 1 lg of fitc-conjugated anticox-2 antibody (cayman chemical, ann arbor, mi, usa)
and analyzed on the ﬂow cytometer. the platelet population
was identiﬁed on the basis of its forward and side scatter
distribution, and 10 000 platelets were analyzed.

aggregation studies on isolated reticulated platelets

aggregation of isolated reticulated and non-reticulated platelets was performed on platelets from two subjects. reticulated

492 s. guthikonda et al

platelets were separated from prp using ﬂow cytometry and
thiazole orange staining. platelets thus separated were then
divided into two fractions; aspirin was added to one of these
fractions to a ﬁnal concentration of 50 lm. after incubation for
5 min, aggregation was induced with adp 5 lm, collagen
2 lg ml)1 or aa 1.5 mm (ﬁnal concentrations). as the
number of reticulated platelets obtained was very low
(< 15% of the total platelet count), lta was not a feasible
option. we measured aggregatory responses using ﬂow
cytometry in one subject and a coulter counter in the other
subject (beckman coulter, fullerton, ca, usa). with the use
of a single platelet size gate, only unaggregated platelets were
counted; larger platelet aggregates were thus not counted. the
number of platelets in an unstimulated sample was also
measured. aggregation was calculated by the formula
(unstimulated count – stimulated count) ·100/unstimulated
count.
thromboxane b2 levels

serum thromboxane b2 (txb2) levels were measured by a
commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit
(assay designs, ann arbor, mi, usa) in sera collected by
incubating whole blood at 37 c in a glass tube without
anticoagulants for 1 h and then centrifuging at 1000 g for
15 min to obtain the sera. txb2 levels were measured at baseline,
24 h after aspirin administration, and after ex vivo cox-1
inhibition with 0.3 lm sc-560 (cayman chemicals, ann arbor,
mi, usa) and cox-2 inhibition by 10 lm ns-398 (cayman
chemicals), a speciﬁc cox-2 inhibitor. the ic50 value for
sc-560 with respect to cox-1 is 9 nm, whereas the corresponding ic50 value for cox-2 is 6.3 lm [18]. the ic50 values
with ns-398 for human recombinant cox-1 and cox-2 are 75
and 1.77 lm respectively [19], and these concentrations of both
inhibitors have been used in prior studies [11]. ex vivo inhibition
with speciﬁc cox-1 and cox-2 inhibitors was performed to
assess whether cox-1 and cox-2 are completely inhibited, and
whether any further suppression of txb2 could be achieved.
statistical analysis

as previously planned, the subjects were divided into tertiles
based on the percentage of reticulated platelets. sample size
was calculated to assess a 10% difference in lta. an sd of
10% was assumed, and calculations were based on a power of
80% and a signiﬁcance level of 0.05. normally distributed data
are expressed as mean ± sd. one-way anova was used to
analyze differences in means between tertiles; a kruskal–wallis
anova was used if the data were not normally distributed. a
two-sided unpaired t-test was used to compare means between
two groups; the mann–whitney test was used if the data were
not normally distributed. fisher’s exact test was used to
compare the upper tertile with the other two tertiles, for
dichotomous variables. linear regression analysis was also
performed, and correlation coefﬁcients were calculated for
relationships between reticulated platelet count and agonist-

induced platelet aggregation. p < 0.05 was considered to be
statistically signiﬁcant.
results
baseline characteristics

subjects in each of the three tertiles did not differ in age, sex or
body mass index (table 1). other hematologic parameters
were also similar in the three groups, except for mean platelet
volume, which was signiﬁcantly higher in the upper two tertiles,
reﬂecting the increased size of reticulated platelets.
platelet aggregation

baseline platelet aggregation in response to 5 lm adp was
slightly higher in the upper tertile than in the lower tertile of
reticulated platelets (table 2), with borderline signiﬁcance
(p ¼ 0.06). baseline amounts of aggregation to 20 lm adp
and 1.5 mm aa were similar in the upper and lower tertiles.
the response to 1 lg ml)1 of collagen before aspirin was
greater in the upper tertile (80 ± 7%) than in the lower tertile
(69 ± 22, p ¼ 0.03). after aspirin was administered, platelet
aggregation in response to both 5 and 20 lm adp and collagen
was greater among subjects in the upper tertile than among
those in the lower tertile (table 2, fig. 1).
correlation of percentage reticulated platelets and platelet
aggregation

percentage reticulated platelets signiﬁcantly correlated with
platelet aggregation in response to 5 lm adp (r ¼ 0.53,
p < 0.0001) and 1 lg ml)1 collagen (r ¼ 0.71, p < 0.0001;
fig. 2).

cox-2 expression

platelet cox-2 expression was measured randomly in 10
subjects from the upper tertile and 12 subjects from the
remaining two tertiles. cox-2 was detected in 12 ± 7% of
platelets in the upper tertile, and in 7 ± 3% of platelets in the
lower two tertiles (p ¼ 0.03).
thromboxane synthesis

serum txb2 levels prior to aspirin administration were not
different between the tertiles. after aspirin administration,
serum txb2 levels decreased in all subjects, but remained
signiﬁcantly higher in the upper tertile than in the lower
tertile (5.5 ± 4 ng ml)1 vs. 3.2 ± 2.5 ng ml)1, p ¼ 0.03)
(table 4). we further tested, ex vivo, the contribution of
uninhibited cox-1 (using 0.3 lm sc-560) and cox-2 (using
10 lm ns-398) activity to txb2 production in postaspirin
blood samples. selective inhibition of cox-1 with sc-560
reduced txb2 levels signiﬁcantly (table 4). similarly, selective
inhibition of cox-2 with ns-398 reduced txb2 levels, but to a
slightly lesser degree than sc-560 (82% vs. 90% respectively,
p ¼ 0.05). importantly, addition of either inhibitor ex vivo
eliminated the observed differences in txb2 levels between the
tertiles.

discussion
this study demonstrates for the ﬁrst time that high levels of
circulating immature platelets, possibly reﬂecting a high rate of
platelet turnover, may mediate resistance to the antithrombotic

effects of aspirin. the ﬁndings are internally concordant, in that
we observed, in subjects with high levels of reticulated platelets,
diminished responses to the effects of aspirin detected by lta,
increased expression of surface markers of platelet activation,
and increased txb2 production. furthermore, our results
suggest that when reticulated platelets are isolated, the effects of
aspirin in these platelets are less than those observed in mature
platelets.
it is possible that high platelet turnover confers diminished
aspirin response because of increased generation of uninhibited
cox-1. we tested this concept by measuring serum txb2 after
additional cox-1 inhibition of postaspirin blood samples with
a speciﬁc cox-1 inhibitor, sc-560. incremental inhibition of
cox-1 decreased serum txb2 levels signiﬁcantly, and obviated
the differences in txb2 synthesis between tertiles of platelet
turnover, suggesting incomplete inhibition of cox-1 with
aspirin, and more so in conditions of high platelet turnover.
we further tested whether low response to aspirin may be
explained by non-cox-1-mediated thromboxane production.
although platelets contain cox-1 predominantly, about 8–
10% of platelets express cox-2 [10,11]. in patients with high
platelet turnover states (such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic
purpura [itp], multiple myeloma, and following cardiac
surgery), cox-2 is expressed in 30–60% of platelets [11,20].
 2007 international society on thrombosis and haemostasis

decrease in the antiplatelet eﬀects of aspirin 495

zimmermann et al. studied patients immediately following
cardiac surgery; by day 5, cox-2 expression increased
sixteenfold from preoperative levels, presumably because
of increased platelet release from the bone marrow. in
concordance with this study, we demonstrated that platelet
cox-2 expression is greater in subjects with higher levels of
reticulated platelets than in patients with lower levels of
reticulated platelets.
it was not clear whether the increased platelet cox-2
expression plays a role in txb2 synthesis or platelet aggregation. in platelets with cox-2 expression, in vitro inhibition
with ns-398 decreased txb2 synthesis signiﬁcantly [11]. in
contrast with these results, in patients who underwent cardiac
bypass surgery, cox-2 inhibition with celecoxib did not
decrease thromboxane synthesis [20]. more recently, in smokers, extraplatelet cox-2 but not platelet cox-2 was suggested
as a contributor to thromboxane synthesis, in the absence of
aspirin [15]. hence, to better understand the role of cox-2
activity in txb2 synthesis in the presence of aspirin, we
measured serum txb2 levels after ex vivo inhibition of cox-2
in postaspirin blood samples. txb2 synthesis was signiﬁcantly
suppressed by ex vivo cox-2 inhibition, suggesting that
uninhibited cox-2 activity may contribute to aspirinindependent txb2 synthesis, particularly in conditions of high
platelet turnover.
the clinical impact of reticulated platelets and platelet
turnover on responses to aspirin will need to be studied in a
large clinical setting. in patients hospitalized for cerebrovascular events, the percentage of reticulated platelets was
signiﬁcantly greater than in controls subjects without strokes
[7]. among patients with acute coronary events, those with
an acute myocardial infarction had a signiﬁcantly greater
reticulated platelet count when compared with patients with
unstable angina or stable angina [8]. in these studies, the
increased platelet turnover could be a consequence of the
acute event. whether an increased platelet turnover is a
causative factor in acute ischemic cardiac or cerebrovascular
events is not known. our study has demonstrated that a
higher reticulated platelet count in healthy subjects diminishes
platelet responses to aspirin, and could thus be relevant in a
clinical setting as well.
although there is serious concern regarding cox-2 inhibition in patients with coronary artery disease [21,22], the role of
cox-2 antagonism, possibly transiently, in suppressing
thromboxane synthesis should be studied further. we did not
characterize the origin of txb2 production, which could have
both platelet and extraplatelet sources. monocytes and endothelial cells express cox-2 and demonstrate the ability to
synthesize thromboxane [12–14,23]. thus, the contribution of
other cell types still needs to be assessed.
in conclusion, aspirin resistance is associated with increased
levels of reticulated platelets. increased reactivity of younger
platelets, increased cox-2 expression and activity and incompletely inhibited cox-1 may be possible mechanisms for
aspirin resistance. mechanisms by which reticulated platelets
and platelet turnover impact on coronary events, and methods

to modify antiplatelet therapy on the basis of platelet turnover,
will need to be further evaluated.
