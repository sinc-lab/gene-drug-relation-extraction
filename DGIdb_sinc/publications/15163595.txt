abstract
prostacyclin and its analogues (prostanoids) are potent vasodilators and possess antithrombotic and antiproliferative properties. all of these
properties help to antagonize the pathological changes that take place in the small pulmonary arteries of patients with pulmonary hypertension.
indeed, several prostanoids have been shown to be efficacious to treat pulmonary hypertension, while the main mechanism underlying the
beneficial effects remains unknown. there are indications of beneficial combination effects of prostaglandins and phosphodiesterase inhibitors
and endothelin receptor antagonists. this speaks in favor of combination therapies for pulmonary hypertension in the future.
the mode of application of prostanoids used in randomized controlled studies has been quite variable: continuous i.v. infusion of
prostacyclin, continuous s.c. infusion of  xxxd3415xxx , p.o. application of  xxxd319xxx , and inhaled application of  xxxd2331xxx . in addition, the applied
doses were quite different, ranging from 0.25 ng/kg/min for inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  to 30 – 50 ng/kg/min for i.v. prostacyclin. while the principal
pharmacological properties of all prostanoids are very similar due to a main action on ip receptors, there are considerable differences in
pharmacokinetics and metabolism, with half-lives of 2 min for prostacyclin and about 34 min for  xxxd3415xxx  for i.v. infused drugs and halflives of about 85 min for s.c. infused  xxxd3415xxx . in addition, the adverse effects largely depend on the doses used and the mode of
application, although there is great variability between subjects. it remains to be determined which patients will profit most from which
substance (or combination) and mode of application.

1. introduction
modern drugs for pulmonary hypertension have given
new hope to patients with this terrible life-threatening
disease, but still there is no cure in sight. in severe
idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah), life
expectancy has approximately doubled with i.v. prostacyclin, but this therapy is prone to complications and side
effects. alternative treatments have been developed using
stable analogues, the prostanoids. recently, endothelin
(et) receptor antagonists have also been shown to be
efficacious, and phosphodiesterase (pde) inhibitors are in
development. it can be assumed that combination therapy
will be more effective than single drug therapy. however,
it will be very important to proceed step by step and to
carefully evaluate each single component of the therapy.
this review provides the most recent data on prostacyclin
and its analogues, which appear destined to be important
for the foreseeable future in the treatment of pulmonary
hypertension.

2. treatment of pulmonary hypertension
severe pulmonary hypertension is a disease that drastically limits physical capability and seriously reduces life
expectancy. without treatment, median life expectancy is
only 2.8 years following diagnosis of the illness (d’alonzo
et al., 1991). very often, the patient is forced to give up their
job. even household chores can only be partially managed.
the patients’ independence is massively restricted. the
treatment of pulmonary hypertension is difficult. this stems
from the fact that available therapies are prone to side effects
and complications. they promise improved physical capacity and survival but not a cure.
pulmonary hypertension can result from several underlying diseases or present without an identifiable cause
(idiopathic). it may be associated with risk factors not
sufficiently explaining the disease. these have been listed
by the primary pulmonary hypertension world conference
1998 and have been grouped together with primary pulmonary hypertension (pph) to form a new disease group, pah
(rich, 1998). pulmonary hypertension, due to identifiable
cause as defined at this conference, is explained by defined
pathological mechanisms like increased pulmonary venous
pressure (pulmonary venous hypertension), hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (chronic hypoxic lung diseases and
atmospheric hypoxia), mechanical obstruction (chronic
thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension), and rare diseases
directly affecting the pulmonary arteries. during the third
world conference on pah in venice 2003, pph was
changed into idiopathic pah. independent of the underlying
pathological mechanism, there are similar changes in the
small pulmonary arteries in patients with pulmonary hypertension. most strikingly, vessels show characteristic remodeling with intimal fibrosis, medial hypertrophy, and

adventitial thickening (jeffery & morrell, 2002) as well as
functional changes characterized by vasoconstriction (rich
& brundage, 1987) and in situ thrombosis (pietra, 1994).
while slight to moderate increases of pulmonary pressure and cor pulmonale are quite frequent, particularly
among patients with chronic lung diseases, severe pulmonary hypertension is rare. idiopathic pah is one of the
most common of these rare diseases and has an incidence
of 0.2 – 0.3/100.000/year.
2.1. vasodilators as the therapeutic principle?
all available drugs that have demonstrated positive longterm effects in severe pulmonary hypertension patients are
potent vasodilators. this applies to high-dose ca2 + channel
blockers (rich et al., 1992), et receptor antagonists (rubin
et al., 2002), and prostacyclin (barst et al., 1996) and its
stable analogues (prostanoids). the same applies to pde
blockers (wilkens et al., 2001; ghofrani et al., 2002a,
2002b, 2002c, 2003), which possess potential as efficacious
new therapies. in contrast, other vasodilators like hydralazine (rubin & peter, 1980a, 1980b; sandoval et al., 1994),
adenosine (haywood et al., 1992), and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have not proved to be clinically
effective. this suggests that factors other than vasodilatation
might largely add to the beneficial effects of the clinically
successful substances.
ca2 + channel blockers are only successful in patients
with a substantial pulmonary arterial response to vasodilators (rich et al., 1992; simonneau et al., 1998; barst et al.,
1999). this suggests that ca2 + influx through l-type ca2 +
channels in small pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells
(smc) might be a predominant feature of the disease in
these patients. prostanoids seem to work through a different
mechanism, as the acute vasodilatory response does not
predict the long-term beneficial effect of these substances
(higenbottam et al., 1993). it seems that the same is true for
et receptor antagonists.
2.2. prostacyclin
prostacyclin, discovered in 1976, is a vasodilative and
antiaggregating substance derived from the endothelium
(whittaker et al., 1976). the first published experience with
the synthetic analogue of this substance, epoprostenol,
originated in england, in 1980, where it was used to treat
a girl suffering from idiopathic pah (watkins et al., 1980).
the first publications concerning adults with idiopathic
pah appeared 2 years later (rubin et al., 1982). the first
therapeutic application of prostacyclin via continuous i.v.
infusion was published by higenbottam et al. (1984) in
cambridge. further reports from the united states followed
shortly afterwards (groves et al., 1985). in 1990, the results
of the first randomized trial were published (rubin et al.,
1990). positive results of a long-term study of i.v. prostacyclin in idiopathic pah patients were first described in

h. olschewski et al. / pharmacology & therapeutics 102 (2004) 139–153

1993 in england (higenbottam et al., 1993) and in 1994 in
the united states (barst et al., 1994). in 1996, the first
randomized controlled trial with i.v. epoprostenol showed
improved physical capacity, hemodynamics, and survival
compared with control (table 1; barst et al., 1996). these
studies, together with various other observations and
reports, were instrumental for the approval of continuous
i.v. epoprostenol (flolan) in the united states. in the
following years, this therapy was also approved in several
european countries. there are multiple studies reporting
beneficial long-term effects of i.v. prostacyclin that clearly
are superior to the acute and short-term effects (mclaughlin
et al., 1999). a recent long-term study from chicago
included 162 patients over a median period of 31 months.
observed survival with epoprostenol therapy at 1, 2, and 3
years was 87.8%, 76.3%, and 62.8%, respectively, and was
significantly greater than expected survival of 58.9%,
46.3%, and 35.4%, respectively (mclaughlin et al., 2002).
these results were similar to a previous report from the
united states (shapiro et al., 1997) and a recent study
performed in france (sitbon et al., 2002).
prostacyclin has also been used in conditions with
pulmonary hypertension other than idiopathic pah. several
of the early studies included chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (higenbottam et al., 1993). this
therapy has also been successfully applied in children with
idiopathic pah (barst et al., 1994, 1999), hiv-associated
pulmonary hypertension (speich et al., 1991, 2001; petitpretz et al., 1994; opravil et al., 1997), portopulmonary
hypertension (plotkin et al., 1998; kuo et al., 1999;
mclaughlin et al., 1999), and eisenmenger’s syndrome
(rosenzweig et al., 1999), which indicates that i.v. prosta-

141

cyclin is effective in all these groups of patients as in
idiopathic pah. the only controlled study in patients other
than idiopathic pah enrolled patients with pulmonary
hypertension associated with systemic sclerosis. it showed
significant improvement in physical capacity and hemodynamics (badesch et al., 2000) but no improved survival
(table 1).
2.3. problems with intravenous prostanoids
because of a half-life of only 2– 3 min, epoprostenol can
only be applied in the form of a continuous infusion by an
implanted i.v. catheter and a mobile minipump. even short
interruptions in the therapy bear the risk of right ventricular
failure (barst et al., 1994; cremona & higenbottam, 1995).
with i.v.  xxxd2331xxx , due to the longer half-life, this seems to be
less problematic. more or less frequent local infections at
the entry point of the catheter require antibiotic treatment.
sepsis is quite rare (at experienced centers 0.5/patient/year)
but has a potentially fatal outcome. hickman line infections
are more frequently seen in the absence of sepsis. the true
incidence is not known. infections often necessitate the
removal of the catheter. side effects of this therapy are
common and include jaw pain, leg and foot pain (similar to
sudeck’s syndrome), headache, diarrhea, ascites, and red
skin (ahearn et al., 2002). the cause of these side effects is
unknown as is an effective approach to treatment. moreover,
in a small group of patients, there is unexplained weight loss
after long treatment periods (brundage, 1998).
higenbottam et al. (1998b) summarized their long-term
experience with i.v. prostacyclin and  xxxd2331xxx  in a recent
publication. the surprising finding was that prostanoids

only improved survival in those patients who presented with
right heart decompensation at baseline. in contrast, patients
with compensated cardiac function (central venous oxygen
saturation >60%) had no beneficial effect. this could mean
that the survival benefit was entirely based on right ventricular recompensation and the favorable effects of the prostanoids on the pulmonary vessels were outweighed by
problems associated with this therapy. these complications
are almost completely due to i.v. application (e.g., septic
events, catheter-associated embolism, and technical interruptions of the therapy).
the high cost of therapy is mostly explained by the price
of the agent itself with a considerable difference between
north america and the rest of the world. the starting dose is
4 –8 ng/kg/min and is increased by about 2 – 4 ng/kg/min
every 2 weeks until a dose of about 50 ng/kg/min is reached.
this mode of dosing is commonly used in the united states,
while in the uk, the doses are frequently lower than this.
much higher doses, up to 200 ng/kg/min, have been used in
the united states, but this increases the side effects without
adding considerable therapeutic benefit and has been increasingly abandoned (mclaughlin et al., 1998).
2.4. stable prostacyclin analogues
in the search for alternative methods of prostanoid application, p.o. preparations (galie et al., 2002), continuous s.c.
infusion (simonneau et al., 2002), and inhalation (olschewski et al., 2002b) have been shown to be efficacious.
in countries other than north america, the stable prostacyclin analogue  xxxd2331xxx  can be used as a continuous
infusion alternatively to epoprostenol infusion. i.v.  xxxd2331xxx 
was recently approved for pph and secondary pulmonary
hypertension (sph) in new zealand.  xxxd2331xxx  seems to have
similar clinical effects to prostacyclin (higenbottam et al.,
1998a, 1998b; ewert et al., 2000) and offers considerable
practical advantages compared with prostacyclin particularly due to chemical stability, longer plasma half-life, and easy
solubility in physiological saline.
the following chapters will review the similarities and
differences of these substances.

3. mechanism of prostanoid action
3.1. reduced prostacyclin/thromboxane ratio
the synthesis of prostacyclin is reduced in chronic
pulmonary hypertension, whereas the synthesis of thromboxane a2 (txa2), its physiological antagonist, is increased (christman et al., 1992). accordingly, there is
histological evidence of reduced  xxxg1880xxx  expression in the pulmonary arteries of patients with pph
(tuder et al., 1999). this shift in the balance from prostacyclin to txa2 favors vasoconstriction, proliferation,
thrombosis, and inflammation in the affected vessels and

could have great significance for the development and
progression of pulmonary hypertension. taking this into
account, therapy with prostacyclin represents the substitution of an endogenous deficit that plays a central role in the
pathology of pulmonary hypertension.
3.2. pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells
prostaglandins (pgs) exert their effects on cells after
binding to specific pg and tx receptors (fig. 1). these
are g protein-coupled receptors that mediate the activating
or inhibiting effects of the 5 naturally occurring cyclooxygenase metabolites: pgi2 (prostacyclin),  xxxg1073xxx ,  xxxd124xxx ,
pge2, and  xxxd1902xxx , whereas txa2 specifically binds to the
 xxxg2253xxx . pharmacologically, the pg receptors were
initially classified as ip, dp, ep, fp, and tp receptors
according to their endogenous ligands. the ep receptors
have been further differentiated pharmacologically into the
ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3, and  xxxg1875xxx  subtypes and molecular cloning
of all these receptors has revealed further heterogeneity by
alternative mrna splicing (pierce & regan, 1998; pierce
et al., 1999).
in the lung, 4 types of prostanoid receptors have been
identified which regulate vascular tone, platelet activation,
and immunological cell responses. tx receptors mediate
constriction and are coupled with phospholipase c activation and ca2 + mobilization (jones et al., 1997). ep3
receptors also mediate constriction. ep3-induced cell activation occurs through phosphoinositide metabolism and
ca2 + release via pertussis toxin-insensitive gq proteins as
well as inhibition of cyclic  xxxd81xxx 
(camp) via gi proteins (coleman et al., 1994; negishi et
al., 1995). the vasoconstrictor effect mediated by activation
of ep3 receptors becomes evident when the  xxxg1873xxx  receptor is
inactivated. this was shown in the  xxxg1873xxx  knockout mouse,
where the infusion of  xxxd124xxx  had a vasoconstrictor effect,
while the same drug induced vasodilation in the wild type
(kennedy et al., 1999).
in contrast, vascular effects linked to ip and  xxxg1873xxx  receptors increase plasma camp and have vasodilatory effects.
stimulation of adenylate cyclase and increasing intracellular
camp levels, associated with opening of ca2 + -activated
k + channels (schubert et al., 1996; dumas et al., 1997;
jones et al., 1997; clapp et al., 1998), are the common
signaling events in response to receptor occupancy by both
ligands. the increased k + conductance results in cell
hyperpolarization and block of l-type ca2 + channels,
resulting in vasodilation. this mechanism acts to a maximum within a few minutes and is present in adult and fetal
pulmonary arteries (olschewski et al., 2002a). another
consequence of camp increase is inhibition of the myosin
light chain kinase (hartshorne et al., 1998).
in the human pulmonary vascular system, the longitudinal
distribution of these receptors is not homogeneous. the ip
receptor is expressed in the vascular tissues of pulmonary
arteries and veins, where its expression is confined to smcs.

fig. 1. major signal transduction pathways in smc induced by pg and txa2. pg and txa2 receptors are coupled to different intracellular signaling cascades
via activation of specific g proteins. after binding to different receptors, the vessel tone is changed via gs (stimulatory)- and gi (inhibitory)-coupled control of
adenylate cyclase (ac). the vasodilatory effects are mediated by activation of  xxxg1836xxx  (pka), whereas the vasoconstrictor effects are mediated by gqcoupled phosphoinositide breakdown activating the release of ca2 + from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr). dag, diacylglycerol; ip3, inositol-1,4,5-phosphate;
pkc, protein kinase c; plc, phospholipase c; vein, pulmonary veins; da, ductus arteriosus. from olschewski et al. (2001a).

in contrast, it has recently been shown that ep receptors,
mediating vasorelaxation, are predominantly expressed in
pulmonary veins (walch et al., 1999). the  xxxg1875xxx ,
which is expressed in the ductus arteriosus smc, is critical
for closure of the ductus arteriosus induced by a decrease of
pge2 levels after birth (nguyen et al., 1997).
the specificity of different pgs for certain receptor
subtypes and the distribution of these subtypes in the human
lung, platelets, and inflammatory cells are of basic interest
in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. for example,
the low  xxxg1873xxx  receptor expression in pulmonary arteries
compared with veins may explain why  xxxd124xxx , a strong
activator of the  xxxg1873xxx  receptor, is less effective than pgi2
and  xxxd2331xxx  in reducing pulmonary resistance at least in the
hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension model (dumas et
al., 1997). on the other hand, this could provide a rationale
for treating pulmonary venoocclusive disease with  xxxd124xxx 
rather than pgi2. the development of specific activators and
blockers of the different receptors could have far-reaching
therapeutic consequences.
3.3. prostaglandin action beyond vasodilation
a variety of vascular cells (endothelial cells, fibroblasts,
and smcs), platelets, and leukocytes (polymorphonuclear
neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and t-lymphocytes)
have been identified as sensitive target cells for the antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory, and antiaggregatory actions
of pgs (fig. 2). on the cellular level, the objectives of pg
therapy are (1) to reduce the increased vascular wall stress

by relaxation of vascular smcs, (2) to prevent or reverse the
structural reorganization of pulmonary vessels (antiremodeling), (3) to inhibit primary or secondary thrombus-mediated obliteration via inhibition of platelet aggregation, and
(4) to suppress inflammatory activity near the vessels.
antimitotic effects of endogenous and exogenous pgs have
been demonstrated in vascular smcs and fibroblasts (schror
& weber, 1997; sinzinger et al., 1997). the camp signaling system and the activation of  xxxg1836xxx  have been
identified as the predominant growth inhibitory signal
transduction pathways. the mechanism underlying the
camp-mediated antiproliferative effects has been suggested
to be (1) the suppression of tyrosine phosphorylation of the
 xxxg1995xxx   xxxg1904xxx  and (2) the downregulation of cell cycle regulatory proteins (i.e., cyclindependent kinases; giasson et al., 1997; vadiveloo et al.,
1997; fukumoto et al., 1999).
in addition to these antimitogenic effects, a dramatic
decrease in extracellular matrix protein production in fibroblasts and endothelial cells (i.e., collagen and glycosaminoglycans) may contribute to the inhibition of the remodeling
process (sinzinger et al., 1997) as well as the anticoagulatory effects. platelets and monocytes have been identified as
preferential target cells for pg-evoked changes in the
plasma coagulation profiles (crutchley & hirsh, 1991;

protein expression (d’acquisto et al., 1998; lo et al., 1998).
in t-lymphocytes, the anti-inflammatory effects may involve the reduction of  xxxg2296xxx -a as well as
interferon-g and interleukin-2 (della et al., 1997a).
long-term effects in systemic sclerosis were found after
intermittent  xxxd2331xxx  infusion every 6 weeks over 1 year. both
the cutaneous fibrosis and the capillaroscopic patterns were
better in patients treated with  xxxd2331xxx  than in patients treated
with nifedipine. the production of interleukin-1h in alloactivated circulating mononucleated cells was significantly
lower in the  xxxd2331xxx  group than in the nifedipine group.
there was a significant positive covariance between interleukin-1h changes and the changes in both the skin score and
the capillaroscopic score. this suggested that the long-lasting
modulation of the cytokine network could be a potential
mechanism responsible for the persistent efficacy of  xxxd2331xxx 
despite its intermittent administration (della et al., 1997b).
3.4. long-term effects of prostanoid therapy
prostanoids are potent pulmonary vasodilators, but the
majority of patients have a minor acute response to i.v.
prostacyclin and develop much more vasodilatation during
long-term therapy (mclaughlin et al., 1999; hoeper et al.,
2000b). this phenomenon is not completely understood. it
can be explained by the antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory,
and antithrombotic prostanoid effects. this would lead to
chronic reversal of the remodeling process and involve
smcs, fibroblasts, and extracellular matrix. it is difficult
to investigate the effects of prostacyclin in vitro, as the
substance is chemically unstable. for that reason,  xxxd2331xxx , a
stable prostacyclin analogue, has been used instead of
prostacyclin in most of these studies.  xxxd2331xxx  increases
intracellular camp, inhibiting neutrophil adherence to endothelial monolayers and preventing lung damage in a
model of neutrophil-induced lung injury (riva et al.,

1990). anti-inflammatory actions may also be important
in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension where increased
pro-inflammatory mediators and activated macrophages
suggest a critical role of inflammatory processes in pathogenesis (wright et al., 1998).
indeed, in human neutrophils isolated from patients with
pph and sph, we found a marked down-regulation of
neutrophil inflammatory mediators (i.e., elastase release,
oxidative burst, and generation of leukotrienes) after inhalation of  xxxd2331xxx  (rose et al., 2003).
however, there is no direct evidence that prostanoids
reverse remodeling, neither in animal models of pulmonary
hypertension nor in patients who were treated long-term with
high doses of prostacyclin. as an alternative explanation for
the favorable long-term effects, pathological changes in the
pulmonary artery smcs (dysfunctional stiffening) could be a
dominant feature (fig. 3). this could involve the intracellular
ca2 + stores, expression of k + channels, and contractile
apparatus including the myosin light chain phosphatase and
kinase regulation.

fig. 3. mechanism of vasodilative prostanoid effects on smc. pvr
increase in pulmonary hypertension results from vasoconstriction (reversible) and remodeling (irreversible). additionally, there may be a very
slowly reversible narrowing, which could be due to dysfunctional stiffening
of the smcs. this factor is thought to be the most important target for
prostanoid action, while reversal of remodeling by prostanoids has not been
demonstrated clinically or in experimental models.

4. interaction with other
locally acting vasoactive principles

account for disappointing long-term effects in spite of
favorable short-term effects.

4.1.  xxxd2738xxx 

4.2. phosphodiesterases and phosphodiesterase inhibitors

inhalation with no leads to pulmonary-selective vasodilatation because the gas diffuses into the pulmonary
resistance vessels where it activates  xxxg1587xxx .
according to current theory, it is the product of guanylyl
cyclase,  xxxd1274xxx  (cgmp), which is
mainly responsible for vascular relaxation. no immediately
binds to hemoglobin on entry into the blood and is thus
biologically inactivated (frostell & zapol, 1995). this
eliminates the risk of systemic side effects and the effect
is restricted to the pulmonary vessels.
pulmonary-selective vasodilatation with no in severe
pulmonary hypertension was first described in 1991
(pepke-zaba et al., 1991) and compared with i.v. prostacyclin. the effect of prostacyclin on pulmonary vascular
resistance (pvr) was considerably larger but not selective
to the lung. nonpulmonary effects of infused prostacyclin
(baroreflex activation) might have accounted for the difference in the effect on pvr. in a previous study, we directly
compared the effects of inhaled no with inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  in
idiopathic pah patients and again found that many more
patients had a significant response to  xxxd2331xxx  than to no
(hoeper et al., 2000a). the response to no was not
predicted by the cgmp increase (ghofrani et al., 2002b).
it is unknown why prostanoids are more potent pulmonary
vasodilators than inhaled no in idiopathic pah. in most
animal models and in acute respiratory distress syndrome
patients, no is at least as potent as prostanoids (walmrath
et al., 1996). possibly, idiopathic pah patients develop
mechanisms that cause inactivation of no or, in particular,
its second messenger cgmp. one of these mechanisms is
the up-regulation of pde 5. such mechanisms could be
part of the underlying pathological mechanism of the
disease.
while inhaled no is successful in treating persistent
pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (roberts et al.,
1992, 1997; kinsella et al., 1997), long-term therapy with
no in idiopathic pah has been carried out only in single
cases or small series of patients (snell et al., 1995; channick
et al., 1996).
in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, extensive
multicenter studies found no long-term beneficial clinical
effects of no (luhr et al., 1997, 1998; dellinger et al.,
1998; dellinger, 1999; lundin et al., 1999). in fact, the
reason for these sobering results remains unresolved and
could concern the rebound phenomenon (miller et al., 1995;
atz et al., 1996; cueto et al., 1997) and toxicological issues.
indeed, peroxynitrite, one of the toxic no products, targets
the host organism and inhibits  xxxg1880xxx  (zou &
ullrich, 1996), the key enzyme of prostacyclin synthesis.
according to recent investigations, no also causes an
increased et-1 release (earley et al., 2002) that could

pdes are abundant in the lung and mediate the breakdown of camp and cgmp. while pde 3 and 4 are most
important for camp breakdown, pde 5 (and 3) is most
important for cgmp degradation. recently, we described
the effects of specific pde inhibitors in a rabbit model of
pulmonary hypertension (schermuly et al., 1999, 2000).
the combination of inhaled prostacyclin with low doses of
i.v. pde inhibitors resulted in significant prolongation and
amplification of the prostanoid-induced decrease in pulmonary artery pressure (pap) without affecting systemic
arterial pressure.
subthreshold systemic doses of monoselective pde 3
and 4 inhibitors and, in particular, the dual-selective pde 3
and 4 inhibitors all significantly amplified the pulmonary
vasodilatory response to inhaled pgi2 while fully maintaining the pulmonary selectivity of the prostanoid-elicited
vasorelaxation (schermuly et al., 1999, 2000, 2001a,
2001b, 2003). the combination of pde 3 and 4 inhibitors
had synergistic effects. these data suggest that selective
inhibition of pde 3 or 4 might be partly compensated for by
increased hydrolysis of camp through the alternate catabolism pathway, and full efficacy in elevating camp levels is
achieved by dual inhibition of both pde 3 and 4. the
combination of inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  with the potent pde 5
inhibitor sildenafil also showed synergistic effects in a
variety of small encouraging studies in pulmonary hypertension patients (wilkens et al., 2001; ghofrani et al.,
2002a, 2002b) that could be therapeutically relevant.
4.3. endothelin and endothelin receptor antagonists
using immunostaining, giaid et al. (1993) demonstrated
that et is only marginally detectable in the various sections
of the pulmonary vascular vessels in healthy people and in
patients suffering from pulmonary diseases without pulmonary hypertension. in contrast, et was easily detected in
various pulmonary vascular sections in severe pulmonary
hypertension of different etiologies. this was not only the
case in small, constricted vessels but also in large, dilated
pulmonary vessels. increased concentrations of et have
been found in blood samples taken from newborns suffering
from persistent pulmonary hypertension (allen et al., 1993;
rosenberg et al., 1993; rubens et al., 2001), and an
experimental intrauterine ligation of the arterial duct in
sheep led to an increase in et receptor activity (ivy et al.,
1996). these results are consistent with the idea that an
increase in pulmonary pressure contributes to the up-regulation of the et system, thus activating vascular remodeling
and vasoconstriction. accordingly, et could play a decisive
role in the perpetuation of pulmonary hypertension. the
finding that the pulmonary pressure increase following

146

h. olschewski et al. / pharmacology & therapeutics 102 (2004) 139–153

intrauterine ligation of the arterial duct can be reduced by
the  xxxg676xxx  receptor antagonist bq123 (ivy et al., 1997)
further supports this idea.
the vasoconstrictive effect of et is partly explained by
 xxxg676xxx  receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase c in
smcs, which leads to ca2 + release from intracellular stores
into the cytoplasm. however, the effects appear to be much
more complex: after stimulation of the  xxxg676xxx  receptor, dna
synthesis is activated, allowing cell proliferation. at the
same time, camp levels are increased, which inhibit dna
synthesis. in contrast, the stimulation of  xxxg677xxx  receptors
inhibits camp production and thus increases the rate of
dna synthesis (takimoto et al., 1996).
davie et al. (2002) investigated the distribution of eta and  xxxg677xxx  receptors in pulmonary arteries from pulmonary hypertensive patients and control subjects and investigated their role in mediating the proliferative effects
of et on distal human pulmonary artery smcs. they
found that receptor density was 2-fold greater in pulmonary hypertensive patients than in control subjects and
that  xxxg677xxx  receptors were predominantly expressed in
distal pulmonary arteries compared with central arteries.
cicaprost, a stable prostacyclin analogue, inhibited et-1
release from pulmonary artery smc and increased intracellular camp levels predominantly via  xxxg677xxx  receptors.
on the other hand, the antiproliferative effects of cicaprost were attenuated by et via  xxxg676xxx  and  xxxg677xxx  receptors.
this indicates a considerable antagonistic interaction of
prostanoids with the et system. this could indeed
explain some of the beneficial long-term effects of
prostanoids.

5. pharmacological characteristics of
prostacyclin analogues and clinical studies
three prostacyclin analogues have been developed for
treatment of pulmonary hypertension:  xxxd3415xxx ,  xxxd319xxx , and  xxxd2331xxx  (fig. 4). despite some differences, the

fig. 4. chemical structure of epoprostenol and its stable analogues.

substances seem to have quite similar pharmacological and
pharmacodynamic properties. they are stable in physiological saline at room temperature and can be diluted with
physiological solutions without risk of inactivation.  xxxd2331xxx  is the agent that has been most intensively investigated in different animal models and man. in man, serum
half-life is 20– 25 min (krause & krais, 1986; hildebrand
et al., 1990). the effects on pulmonary arteries are
predominantly mediated by the  xxxg1879xxx  (walch et al.,
1999).  xxxd2331xxx  also activates the  xxxg1872xxx , but the
significance of this activation is not known. in comparison,
cicaprost is specific for the  xxxg1879xxx  (kiriyama et al.,
1997). these compounds differ in their susceptibility to
metabolic degradation. while  xxxd2331xxx  contains a pentanoic
acid upper side chain, which is subject to h-oxidative
degradation, cicaprost is metabolically stabilized by the
introduction of an oxygen atom at position 3 of the
pentanoic acid chain, preventing h-oxidation. the compound is p.o. available and displays a long duration of
4.5 – 48 hr of antiaggregatory and hypotensive action
(skuballa et al., 1986; sturzebecher et al., 1986). pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics have been studied in
animal models and man (hildebrand et al., 1989; hildebrand, 1992). cicaprost has been used in numerous in vitro
experiments and animal models but has not been clinically
developed for any indication.
there are only a few articles directly comparing the
effects of different prostanoids on proliferation of smcs
and camp production (wharton et al., 2000; clapp et al.,
2002). they found that all prostanoids inhibit proliferation
of human pulmonary arteries ( xxxd3415xxx  >  xxxd2331xxx  = cicaprost
>  xxxd319xxx ) and increase camp. the reasons for the
different potency of these drugs remained unexplained and
camp was not a good predictor of the antiproliferative
effect. this suggests possible involvement of different pathways in the cellular effects.
5.1.  xxxd3415xxx 
 xxxd3415xxx , formerly  xxxd3415xxx , was clinically developed as
a continuous s.c. infusion ( xxxd3415xxx ) to avoid the risk of
i.v. drug application like catheter-related infections and
temporary interruption of the infusion due to malfunction
of the pump or dislodgment of the central venous catheter.
 xxxd3415xxx  is relatively rapidly and completely absorbed
after s.c. infusion with an absolute bioavailability approximating 100%. steady-state concentrations occurred in f 10
hr. concentrations in patients treated with an average dose
of 9.3 ng/kg/min were f 2 ag/l.
there have been 3 pilot studies assessing the safety and
efficacy of  xxxd3415xxx  (mclaughlin et al., 2003). all 3 trials
involved patients with idiopathic pah. one trial compared
the effects of i.v. epoprostenol with i.v.  xxxd3415xxx  and
found that the maximum tolerated dose of  xxxd3415xxx  was
25 ng/kg/min, about 4-fold higher than epoprostenol. the
maximum hemodynamic effects and the side effects, how-

h. olschewski et al. / pharmacology & therapeutics 102 (2004) 139–153

ever, were very similar. the second trial compared the
effects of i.v. and s.c.  xxxd3415xxx  and found that the
maximum tolerated s.c. dose was 10 ng/kg/min and exerted
about the same hemodynamic effects and side effects as the
i.v. dose of 10 ng/kg/min. the half-life of i.v. and s.c.
application was estimated as 26 –42 versus 55 –117 min.
the third trial was an 8-week double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial with s.c.  xxxd3415xxx . two of 17
patients did not tolerate  xxxd3415xxx . the mean tolerated
dose in the remaining 15 patients was 13 ng/kg/min. there
was a trend to beneficial hemodynamic effects and improvement in physical capacity in the verum group.
a large randomized multicenter study investigated the
efficacy of continuous s.c. infusion of  xxxd3415xxx  in
patients with pph, connective tissue disease, or congenital
systemic-to-pulmonary shunts (simonneau et al., 2002). in
this international multicenter trial, significant improvement
of 6-min walk was demonstrated. the main results are
depicted in table 1. improvement in exercise capacity was
greater in the sicker patients and was dose related but
independent of the disease underlying the pulmonary
hypertension. at low tolerated doses up to 8.2 ng/kg/
min, there was no improvement in 6-min walk. at 8.2 –
13.8 ng/kg/min, the increase was 20 m. in patients
tolerating more than 13.8 ng/kg/min, it was 36 m. most
patients (85%) reported infusion site pain mostly associated with skin reactions at the infusion site (83%) and 8%
discontinued their study medication due to intolerable
abdominal infusion site pain. there were small but significant improvements in pulmonary hemodynamics and an
improvement in the borg dyspnea score. in current practice, the target dose is about 30 ng/kg/min. if this is
tolerated, there are comparable hemodynamic and clinical
effects as with i.v. prostacyclin.
after these studies,  xxxd3415xxx  was approved by the
food and drug administration and by the canadian
authorities.
5.2.  xxxd319xxx 
 xxxd319xxx , formerly trk-100, was developed in japan as
a stable prostacyclin analogue for p.o. use (nishio et al.,
1998). the pharmacology of  xxxd319xxx  was described by
kajikawa et al. (1989) and murata et al. (1989).  xxxd319xxx  is
readily absorbable from the small intestine, and excretion in
the urine and feces is rapid and almost complete after both
p.o. and i.v. dosing. in 1994, the drug was approved in
japan for pph and sph. there were several uncontrolled
studies from japan reporting favorable effects of  xxxd319xxx 
in idiopathic pah patients. there were reports on hemodynamic improvement (saji et al., 1996; okano et al., 1997)
and improved survival compared with historical controls
(nagaya et al., 1999).
a controlled double-blind multicenter study in europe
(alphabet) enrolled 130 patients with idiopathic pah,
connective tissue disease, congenital shunts, and other

147

associated diseases in new york heart association
(nyha) class ii and iii showed a significant improvement
with  xxxd319xxx  compared with placebo (table 1). the dose
of  xxxd319xxx  was given in 4 doses daily and up-titrated by
80 ag/week to a maximum tolerated dose or a maximum
of 480 ag. the mean daily dose after the titration period
was 320 ag. the 6-min walk increased significantly by
25.1 m with a marked difference between idiopathic pah
(46.1 m) and the other patients, who had hardly any
improvement (5.1 m; galie et al., 2002). adverse events
were common during the first 6 weeks of therapy and
included headache (67%), flushing (54%) jaw pain (28%),
and diarrhea (26%). these incidences were markedly
reduced during weeks 7– 12. nine percent in the  xxxd319xxx 
group withdrew prematurely from the study because of
adverse events.
a 1-year double-blind randomized controlled study in
moderate pulmonary hypertension was performed in the
united states. the daily dose of  xxxd319xxx  was 80 ag
q.i.d. the results have not yet been published, but it was
communicated that the 6-min walk was increased after 3
months; however, after 1 year, there was no statistical
difference between  xxxd319xxx  and placebo.
5.3.  xxxd2331xxx 
 xxxd2331xxx  is a prostacyclin analogue and has the same
biological profile as the natural substance with respect to pg
receptor binding and cellular effects (olschewski et al.,
2001a, 2001b). this explains that, during continuous i.v.
use, its effects as well as the side effects are the same as
during prostacyclin infusion (higenbottam et al., 1998a,
1998b). in contrast, the chemical stability is considerably
different. prostacyclin has to be freshly dissolved every 12
hr, continuously cooled, and protected from light to provide
full activity, while  xxxd2331xxx  is stable at room temperature and
normal light. prostacyclin is inactivated in the blood within
1 –3 min after infusion, while  xxxd2331xxx  has a half-life of
nearly 0.5 hr. for these reasons,  xxxd2331xxx  has practical
advantages for daily use compared with prostacyclin. it
has been approved for pph and sph in new zealand.
while prostacyclin is available in the united states and
europe,  xxxd2331xxx  is not marketed in the united states. the
doses used for continuous i.v. therapy range between 1 and
10 ng/kg/min, while the doses used with continuous prostacyclin range between 10 and 50 ng/kg/min, sometimes
even exceeding 100 ng/kg/min. the reasons for this huge
difference are not clear but probably result from both a
higher potency of  xxxd2331xxx  and a different dosing practice in
europe compared with the united states.
to selectively treat the pulmonary vessels in the ventilated areas of the lung, inhaled prostacyclin and  xxxd2331xxx 
have been suggested. because the intraacinar pulmonary
arteries are tightly surrounded by alveolar surfaces, it is
possible to vasodilate these vessels by alveolar deposition of
a prostanoid. for acute vasodilator testing, we applied

148

h. olschewski et al. / pharmacology & therapeutics 102 (2004) 139–153

inhaled prostacyclin or  xxxd2331xxx  using a special inhalation
device, which was tight for aerosols and had a drug-saving
reservoir. for long-term therapy, we used repetitive inhalations with  xxxd2331xxx  6 – 9 times daily. each inhalation lasted
10 –15 min. with alternative devices, it is possible to reduce
the inhalation time to about 4 min (gessler et al., 2001). in
patients with severe pulmonary hypertension, both primary
and secondary inhalation of aerosolized  xxxd2331xxx  resulted in
a substantial decrease in pap and pulmonary resistance,
concomitant with an increase in cardiac output, in the
absence of significant systemic artery pressure drop and
ventilation-perfusion mismatch (olschewski et al., 1996,
1999). in a statistical comparison of the effects of i.v.
prostacyclin and inhaled prostacyclin, the mean acute effect
on pvr was equal; however, during inhaled prostacyclin,
the pap decreased significantly and the systemic artery
pressure was stable, whereas, during i.v. prostacyclin, the
systemic pressure decreased significantly and the pap was
stable (olschewski et al., 1996). this observation was
consistent with preceding findings in mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure (walmrath et al.,
1993, 1995, 1996; eichelbronner et al., 1996; zwissler et
al., 1996; putensen et al., 1998; de jaegere & van den
anker, 1998). moreover, we reported a patient with severe
circulatory shock and right ventricular decompensation due
to severe idiopathic pah (olschewski et al., 1998) and a
patient with decompensating right heart failure in severe
lung fibrosis (olschewski et al., 1999), both refractory to
maximum conventional therapy, in whom a most favorable
acute improvement of hemodynamics and long-term survival was achieved by  xxxd2331xxx  aerosolization. in severe lung
fibrosis, an increase of the pulmonary shunt blood flow may
limit the use of i.v. prostacyclin (olschewski et al., 1999),
whereas inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  can be administered safely if the
dose per inhalation is not too high. interestingly, we
observed not only clinical improvement due to improved
hemodynamics but also halted progression of the highly
active interstitial lung disease.
in uncontrolled studies with inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  in severe
pph and sph, a significant clinical and hemodynamic
improvement was demonstrated together with an improved
physical capacity (hoeper et al., 2000b; olschewski et al.,
2000).
a large randomized double-blind placebo-controlled european multicenter study (aerosolized  xxxd2331xxx  randomized;
olschewski et al., 2002b) showed significant effects of
inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  (table 1). the primary end point of the
study, defined as an improvement in nyha class, combined
with at least 10% improvement in the 6-min walking test
and no prior deterioration or death (combined clinical end
point) was reached by 3.4 times more patients in the  xxxd2331xxx 
versus the placebo group (16.8% vs. 4.9%; p = 0.007).
treatment effects did not differ between subgroups. in the 6min walking test, the treatment effect was 36.4 m in favor of
 xxxd2331xxx  ( p < 0.01). there was a treatment effect on nyha
functional class ( p < 0.05), quality of life assessments by

the euroqol visual analogue scale ( p < 0.05), and
mahler dyspnea transition index ( p < 0.05). hemodynamics significantly deteriorated in the placebo group,
whereas, in the  xxxd2331xxx  group, preinhalation values were
unchanged compared with baseline and postinhalation values were significantly improved. importantly, the number of
patients remaining on study medication was significantly
higher in the  xxxd2331xxx  than in the placebo group. the most
common reasons for premature discontinuation were right
heart failure, death, and withdrawal of consent due to lack of
clinical benefit. over 3 months of therapy, there was no
indication of tachyphylaxis. in the  xxxd2331xxx  group, 1 (1.0%)
patient died during the double-blind study period versus 4
(4.0%) patients in the placebo group. overall, the therapy
was well tolerated. cough occurred more frequently in the
 xxxd2331xxx  compared with the placebo group (38.6 vs. 25.5%)
as well as headache (29.7 vs. 19.6%) and flush (26.7 vs.
8.8%). these adverse events were mild and mostly transient.
syncope occurring in the  xxxd2331xxx  group was more often
rated as serious than in the placebo group but was commonly not associated with clinical deterioration. as conclusions of this study, inhalation of  xxxd2331xxx  is an effective
and safe therapy for severe pph and non-pph in nyha
functional class iii and iv. this approach combines effectivity with excellent tolerability and safety, with no evidence
of tachyphylaxis during a 3-month treatment period.
a long-term study with inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  over 2 years
with an initial 3-month controlled randomized phase (aerosolized  xxxd2331xxx  randomized-2) enrolled 63 patients with
pph (n = 40) and sph (n = 23; olschewski abstract
esc). inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  treatment was administered for up
to 2 years. the median daily aerosolized dose was 100 ag
(total inhaled dose c 24 ag) divided into 6 inhalations.
kaplan-meier estimates for mortality as a time-to-event
variable were calculated for all patients until end of study.
patients were in nyha class ii (33%), iii (48%), and iv
(19%). the mean f sem 6-min walking distance was
344.3 f 15.7 m (pph 374.5 f 17.7 m; sph 290.0 f
27.0 m) and the mean pap was 55.6 f 14.0 mm hg
(pph 54.1 f 12.9 mm hg; sph 58.1 f 15.8 mm hg).
during the 2-year period, 5 patients were switched to an
alternative therapy, 18 prematurely stopped the study, and
8 patients died (pph n = 3, sph n = 5). two of these
patients died before receiving inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  treatment.
the overall survival rate according to kaplan-meier was
0.850 for the 2-year study period, including the randomized phase. for pph patients, the expected survival rate
according to the baseline hemodynamic data (1) was
0.631, which corresponds to c 15 deaths. in contrast,
only 3 pph patients died with a kaplan-meier estimate of
0.914 (95% confidence interval = 0.81; c 1). this suggests that survival on long-term treatment with inhaled
 xxxd2331xxx  may be substantially improved.
the pulmonary selectivity of inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  provides
the possibility of effectively applying prostanoids in patients
who are prone to systemic pressure drop (e.g., in portopul-

h. olschewski et al. / pharmacology & therapeutics 102 (2004) 139–153

monary hypertension) and patients with particularly low
systemic pressures (e.g., in emergency situations). the
intrapulmonary selectivity allows prostanoid application in
patients who are prone to intrapulmonary right to left shunt
(e.g., heptopulmonary syndrome and lung fibrosis;
olschewski et al., 1999). additionally, the inhaled application combines perfectly with other effective treatments for
pulmonary hypertension as it does not add substantially to
their specific side effects. there is some experience with
combination with i.v. and p.o. prostanoids and with et
receptor antagonists. a more specific positive interaction is
used with the combination of inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  and pde
blockers. the specific pulmonary vasodilative effects of
 xxxd2331xxx , which are mediated by an intracellular increase of
camp, can be increased by blocking the breakdown of this
second messenger with pde inhibitors (schermuly et al.,
2001a, 2001b; wilkens et al., 2001; ghofrani et al., 2002c).
in our center, we have had very positive experience with the
combination of inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  and sildenafil (ghofrani et
al., 2002b) and have been successfully using this combination for more than 2 years in a considerable number of
patients. with a retarded application of inhaled  xxxd2331xxx , the
inhalation intervals could be prolonged and the pulmonary
selectivity could be increased. this would also open the way
to the development of metered dose inhalers.
inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  is effective for treatment of precapillary
pulmonary hypertension and may provide an alternative to
the use of i.v. prostacyclin, particularly where this agent has
not shown a survival benefit. when the clinical effects of
inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  and i.v. prostacyclin are compared, the
inhalation has clear advantages but also certain drawbacks.
most importantly, the inhalation provides potent pulmonary
vasodilatation without systemic side effects and risk of
catheter complications. additionally, it allows therapy in
patients with preexistent ventilation-perfusion mismatch and
in those who are prone to develop such a mismatch during
systemic prostanoid application. the most important drawback is the fact that the hemodynamic effect of inhaled
 xxxd2331xxx  levels off within 30 –90 min and that 6 –9 inhalations daily are necessary. inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  has been approved
by the european authorities (emea) for idiopathic pah,
nyha class iii and will be marketed in most european
countries in 2004.
in conclusion, prostacyclin and its analogues have given
new hope to patients with pulmonary hypertension. i.v.
prostacyclin was the first effective therapy and is still the
widely considered therapy of choice in very sick patients
with right heart decompensation. i.v.  xxxd2331xxx  has not been
evaluated in controlled randomized studies but could be
equally effective to i.v. prostacyclin and offer some practical
advantages. it has been approved for therapy of pulmonary
hypertension only in new zealand but is available in most
european countries in other indications. the drawbacks of
continuous i.v. therapy, line infections, and discontinuation
of therapy due to technical problems are avoided by
alternative application modes of prostacyclin analogues.

s.c.  xxxd3415xxx  is an effective treatment of pah if tolerated
at higher doses; unfortunately, a considerable number of
patients withdraw from this therapy due to infusion site pain
and local complications. p.o.  xxxd319xxx  might provide shortterm improvement in patients with mild pulmonary hypertension but is often associated with adverse effects like
headache and nausea. inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  is an effective treatment of pulmonary hypertension and due to predominant
pulmonary compared with systemic effects provides prostanoid treatment with few side effects. in parallel with new
treatments like et receptor antagonists and new potent pde
inhibitors, the prostanoids will always have a role in the
treatment of pulmonary hypertension.
