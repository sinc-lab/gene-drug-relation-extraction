summary

background: adalimumab, a fully human monoclonal
antibody to  xxxg2296xxx , was recently
introduced for therapy of crohn’s disease.
aim: since induction of apoptosis of inflammatory
cells is thought to be an important mechanism of
action of the antitumour necrosis factor monoclonal
antibody infliximab, we studied the induction of
apoptosis of activated peripheral blood monocytes by
adalimumab.
method: apoptosis was analysed at the levels of the
cell membrane, mitochondria and dna by flow
cytometry.

introduction

 xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-a is a cytokine, which
exerts its activity as either the cell surface-associated
26-kda prepeptide [transmembrane  xxxg2296xxx  (tmtnf-a)]
or as the cleavage product, the 17-kda secreted protein
(soluble  xxxg2296xxx ) generated by  xxxg2296xxx -converting
enzyme.1 the proinflammatory effects of  xxxg2296xxx  are
important in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel
disease (ibd).2 a wide array of biological agents has
been designed to inhibit  xxxg2296xxx ,3 especially the antihuman  xxxg2296xxx  monoclonal antibodies (mab) infliximab
(chimaeric) and adalimumab (fully humanized); and

results: we found that both adalimumab and infliximab
induced apoptosis in cultured monocytes, while etanercept did not. apoptosis induction was caspase-dependent and detectable already after 2 h. the production of
 xxxg1161xxx  and  xxxg1164xxx  by monocytes was
down-regulated significantly by adalimumab and infliximab but not by etanercept, while levels of soluble
 xxxg2296xxx  in monocyte cultures were
down-regulated by all three reagents.
conclusions: these data show that both adalimumab
and infliximab affect monocyte cytokine production and
induce apoptosis of activated monocytes. our findings
will have to be further correlated to therapeutic efficacy
of these antitumour necrosis factor reagents.

soluble tnf receptor fusion constructs: p75 subunit
(etanercept) and  xxxd924xxx  subunit (onercept). surprisingly,
results of treatment with different neutralizing reagents
in crohn’s disease (cd) are divergent. infliximab, the
chimaeric immunoglobulin (ig)g1, has been shown to
have high efficacy for the treatment of luminal and
fistulizing cd as well as for the control of extraintestinal
manifestations of ibd.4–6 adalimumab, whose human
nature is expected to be associated with less immunogenicity than a chimaeric one, was found effective in cd
in a recent update report.7 cdp-571 (an igg4 isotype
variant of infliximab) and  xxxd462xxx  (an f(ab’)2 fragment of infliximab) are also although somewhat less
effective.8–12 on the contrary, the result of treatment
with etanercept was disappointing.13 the importance of
apoptosis induction to obtain disease remission was
suggested by several groups. the exact mechanism is

unclear, but infliximab is known to bind both soluble
and membrane-bound tnf, and to kill tnf-expressing
cells.14 lugering et al.15 showed that infliximab induces
apoptosis of peripheral blood (pb) monocytes from
healthy volunteers and patients with cd in a dosedependent manner by activation of  xxxg342xxx , 9 and 3
in a fas-independent manner. ten hove et al.16 showed
that infliximab induces apoptosis of lamina propria
t cells in vivo and in the cd3/cd28-activated t-cell line
(jurkat cells). the same group expanded on these
observations and showed that in contrast to etanercept,
infliximab induces apoptosis of activated pb and lamina
propria cells via activation of  xxxg341xxx .17 the proapoptotic effect of infliximab was also shown by
disabatino et al.18 in vitro on lamina propria t cells
and pb t cells from cd patients. this concept of
apoptosis induction by infliximab becomes even more
attractive in view of data suggesting that a defect in
apoptosis is a basic abnormality in the pathogenesis of
ibd.19, 20
the aim of this study is to compare the capacity of the
newly developed mab adalimumab to induce apoptosis
with that of infliximab and etanercept.

materials and methods

reagents and antibodies
fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc)-conjugated antihuman cd14 (m/p9, igg2b), phycoerythrin (pe)-conjugated antihuman  xxxg382xxx  (p67.6, igg1) and isotype
control (x40, iggc1), fitc-conjugated  xxxg166xxx ,
 xxxd3027xxx  (pi) and pan-caspase inhibitor
(z-vad-fmk) were purchased from bd biosciences
(erembodegem, belgium). pe-conjugated mab  xxxg2298xxx .7
(2.7a6a3) was purchased from immunotech (marseille,
france). 7-amino  xxxd1800xxx -d (7aad) was obtained
from novabiochem (la jolla, ca, usa). human polyclonal immunoglobulins (huigg;  xxxd2207xxx ) were
purchased from novartis (basel, switzerland). infliximab
(remicade, h98-486, igg1) was a gift from scheringplough (centocor inc, malvern, pa, usa). adalimumab
(humira m02-497) was a gift from abbott (abbott park,
il, usa). etanercept (enbrel) was purchased from
immunex (seattle, wa, usa). lipopolysaccharide
(lps) from escherichia coli, serotype 0111:b4 was
obtained from sigma chemical co. (st louis, mo,
usa). recombinant interferon (ifn)-c was bought from
roche diagnostics (mannheim, germany).

isolation of  xxxg382xxx + monocytes
heparinized blood was drawn from healthy volunteers
or patients with active cd. pb mononuclear cells
(pbmcs) were collected by density-gradient centrifugation using  xxxd3253xxx -hypaque (lymphoprep, nycomed,
oslo, norway). monocytes were subsequently obtained
by positive selection using anti- xxxg382xxx -coated microbeads (miltenyi biotec, berdisch gladbach, germany)
and a macs separator. the procedure resulted in 90%
pure cd14+ monocytes as assessed on a facsort
(becton dickinson, san jose, ca, usa).
detection of antibody binding to monocytes
an indirect immunofluorescence technique was used for
detection of adalimumab, infliximab and etanercept
binding. pb  xxxg382xxx + monocytes (1 · 106) were first
cultured with lps (1 lg/ml) at 37 c/5% co2 for 6 h,
washed three times, then incubated with anti-fc
receptor (fcr)i mab (10 lg, 197; medarex, princeton,
nj, usa) and anti-fcrii mab (10 lg, 2.4g2; medarex)
at 4 c for 30 min. cells were subsequently incubated
for 30 min at 4 c with adalimumab (10 lg), infliximab
(10 lg), etanercept (10 lg) or huigg (10 lg), washed
three times, stained with fitc-conjugated goat f(ab’)2antihuman ab, and analysed by flow cytometry. a
scattergram combining side light scatter and forward
light scatter was used to exclude debris and contaminating lymphocytes.
cell culture and determination of apoptosis by  xxxg166xxx ,
 xxxg2298xxx .7 and 7aad staining
isolated monocytes were incubated with anti-fcri mab
(0.1 lg/1 · 106 cells) and anti-fcrii mab (0.1 lg/
1 · 106 cells) at 4 c for 30 min to block fcr. cells
were washed, adjusted to 0.5 · 106 cells in 1 ml rpmi
1640 medium (boehringer, heidelberg, germany) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin (100 u/
ml), streptomycin (100 lg/ml) and 10% bovine calf
serum. a fraction of the monocytes were preincubated
with the pan-caspase inhibitor, z-vad-fmk (50 lm) for
1 h at 37 c. subsequently cells were cultured with lps
1 lg/ml and respectively with adalimumab (10 lg/
ml), infliximab (10 lg/ml), etanecept (10 lg/ml) or
huigg (10 lg/ml). supernatants were collected after
different time periods to measure  xxxg2296xxx , interleukin
(il)-10 and il-12 by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent

assay (elisa). monocytes were harvested after different
times of culture. in a separate experiment, the number
of viable monocytes was calculated by trypan blue
staining. cells were washed, resuspended at 5 · 106/
ml and incubated with 5 ll  xxxg166xxx –fitc and pi,
5 ll  xxxg2298xxx .7–pe-conjugated antibody (ab) or 5 ll of
7aad solution (7aad was dissolved in acetone and
diluted in pbs at a concentration of 20 mg/ml) for
10 min at 4 c protected from light. samples were
immediately analysed with a facsort without wash or
fixation. data on 10 000 events were acquired and
processed using cellquest software.
measurement of cytokines
the concentrations of il-10, il-12 (p70) and  xxxg2296xxx  in
culture supernatants were measured with a sandwich
elisa technique using combinations of unlabelled and
biotin-coupled moab to different epitopes of each
cytokine. coating moab for these three assays, respectively, were jes3-9d7 (pharmingen, san diego, ca,
usa), mab611 (r&d systems, minneapolis, mn, usa)
and 68b2b3/68b6a3 (biosource/medgenix diagnostics, brussels, belgium). biotinylated detection mab
were jes3-12g8 (pharmingen), baf219 (r&d systems)
and 68b3c5 (biosource/medgenix diagnostics). human
recombinant il-10, il-12 and  xxxg2296xxx  were used as
standards. the lower detection limit for all cytokines
was £ 10 pg/ml.
statistical analysis
statistical analysis was performed with prism mac 3.0.
all analyses were performed as comparison of experimental groups with respective controls by mann–
whitney u-testing, or via kruskall–wallis testing where
appropriate. all tests were two-sided and values of
p < 0.05 were considered significant. data are presented as mean ± s.e.m.

compared with huigg-incubated cells (p < 0.05), thus
demonstrating binding of these reagents to the cells.
lps stimulation slightly but not significantly enhanced
binding of each of the three reagents (table 1).
adalimumab and infliximab induce apoptosis of pb
monocytes
induction of apoptosis in vitro was studied with three
different methods:  xxxg166xxx –pi, apo 2.7 and 7aad.
these three assays analyse apoptosis at the level of the
cell membrane, mitochondria and nucleus respectively.21–23 we used huigg as a negative control.
figure 1 exemplifies for the three different methods
that apoptosis occurred in monocytes from a healthy
donor after incubation in vitro with infliximab or
adalimumab. the 48 h kinetic study on pb monocytes
shown in figure 2 further illustrates that a large
proportion of the monocytes incubated with adalimumab or infliximab were apoptotic, while only 0–5%
of the monocytes were apoptotic in etanercept- and
huigg-treated cultures. enhanced apoptosis was detectable already after 2 h. the time-point at which the
highest level of apoptosis could be measured depended
on the method used.  xxxg166xxx  (+) and pi ())
detected maximal apoptosis between 12 and 30 h,
while  xxxg2298xxx .7 detected maximal apoptosis between 2
and 18 h and 7aad between 6 and 30 h. viable cell
number gradually decreased to approximately 50%
after incubation for 48 h with adalimumab or
infliximab, and to approximately 85% after incubation
with etanercept or huigg (table 2).

18 (a, c, d, f, g and i) h with lipopolysaccharide (lps) and either adalimumab, infliximab, etanercept or human polyclonal
immunoglobulins (huigg) as described in materials and methods. apoptosis was analysed by staining with  xxxg166xxx –fluorescein

using cellquest software. numbers shown in each figure from the gated area (m1) represents percentage of [ xxxg166xxx  (+),  xxxg2298xxx .7 (+) or

representative for at least six independent experiments.

apoptosis induced by adalimumab and infliximab
is caspase-dependent
to evaluate whether apoptosis induced by adalimumab
and infliximab is caspase-dependent, we introduced the
pan-caspase inhibitor, z-vad-fmk24, 25 to the cultures.
as shown in figure 3, we found that preincubation of
monocytes with z-vad-fmk significantly down-regulated apoptosis induction with either adalimumab or
infliximab. moreover, this inhibition of apoptosis induction could be confirmed with each of the three methods.
adalimumab and infliximab induces apoptosis of pb
monocytes from cd patients
we next analysed the apoptosis inducing effect of adalimumab and infliximab on monocytes from cd patients.

we investigated apoptosis of monocytes from patients
with active cd at one time-point only: 12 h. both antitnf antibodies induced monocyte apoptosis as detected
by either method (data not shown). we could not find
significant differences in susceptibility to apoptosis
between cd patients and healthy donors. after treatment with etanercept no evidence of apoptosis induction
above background was obtained (data not shown).
adalimumab and infliximab down-regulate il-10
and il-12p70 production of monocytes
finally, we studied the effect of anti-tnf reagents on
cytokine production by lps-stimulated monocytes: il-10
and il-12. although all three reagents efficiently neutralized tnf, we found that il-10 and il-12 production
were down-regulated only by adalimumab and infliximab

however, both adalimumab and infliximab inhibit
il-10 and il-12 production most likely as a result of a
direct effect on monocytes.
discussion

apoptosis induction potentially plays a major role in the
induction of remission of cd by anti-tnf therapy. we
here report that adalimumab, a newly developed
humanized mab to tnf, induces apoptosis of monocytes in vitro, to the same extent as infliximab. both
antibodies induce monocyte apoptosis by a caspasedependent pathway as demonstrated by the use of the
pan-caspase inhibitor, z-vad-fmk. in contrast, etanercept-treated monocytes, similar to the huigg-treated
cells, survived in vitro and only very low percentages
(approximately 5%) of dead cells were detected, probably reflecting spontaneous apoptosis level. we further
found that pb monocytes, no matter whether they
originated from healthy donors or cd patients, were
equally sensitive to apoptosis induction. we used antifcri mab and anti-fcrii mab to block these igg
receptors expressed on the monocytes,26 in order to
exclude ab fc binding to monocytes in the process of
apoptosis induction. the possible induction of apoptosis

apoptotic cell death. in our study, we used annexin

at different cell levels.  xxxg166xxx  binds to phosphatidylserine of the apoptotic cells21 and the combination
with pi enable us to selectively stain early apoptotic
cells.  xxxg2298xxx .7 ab reacts with a 38-kda mitochodrial
membrane protein in cells undergoing apoptosis22 and
7aad specifically binds to the broken end of dna of
non-viable cells.23 we proved apoptosis of monocytes by
all three markers, but there were differences in sensitivity for early apoptosis detection and in the amount of
cells identified as being apoptotic. we found that both
 xxxg166xxx –pi and  xxxg2298xxx .7 are early markers, but
apoptosis could be observed by all three reagents after
incubation for 12–18 h. different markers probably
identify cells at different stages of apoptosis. the
combination of these methods also makes us confident
that apoptosis was indeed the underlying mechanism of
cell death, and the use of the pan-caspase inhibitor,
z-vad-fmk, further corroborates this conclusion.
etanercept also binds to tmtnf expressing monocytes,
but this reagent is monomeric and cannot cross-link
tmtnf.29 scallon et al.29 performed binding studies and
proved that infliximab binds to the tmtnf with higher
avidity than etanercept and moreover, infliximab
formed more stable complexes with tmtnf expressed
on transfected cells relative to analogous complexes
formed with etanercept. thus, high-affinity binding and
cross-linking of tmtnf is probably required to signal the
apoptosis cascade.
we finally also found that lps-induced il-10 and
il-12 productions were affected by adalimumab and
infliximab. as tnf neutralization with etanercept did
not affect il-10 and il-12 production, we hypothesize
that this down-regulation of il-10 and il-12 is due to a
direct functional effect of adalimumab/infliximab on the
cells, or to a lower amount of living cells after
incubation with adalimumab/infliximab.
in the human inflamed gut both macrophages15 and
activated t cells17 express high amounts of tmtnf.

figure 4. interleukin (il)-10 and il-12p70 production by monocytes are down-regulated by adalimumab and infliximab. peripheral
blood (pb)  xxxg382xxx + monocytes (0.5 · 106) were incubated with anti-fc receptor (fcr)i monoclonal antibody (mab) (0.1 lg) and antifcrii mab (0.1 lg), then cultured with adalimumab (10 lg/ml), infliximab (10 lg/ml), etanercept (10 lg/ml) or huigg (10 lg/ml) as
indicated. lipopolysaccharide (lps) (1 lg/ml) was added in all culture conditions. supernatants were collected after different time periods
and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (elisa) was used to detect cytokines. the results represent the median value of at least five
experiments. significances were calculated at each time-point (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).

probably contribute to the beneficial effect of anti-tnf
antibodies. we still do not know which cell type is the
main target of anti-tnf therapy, and studies should
further correlate clinical effectivity of anti-tnf reagents
to their apoptosis-inducing capacity.
