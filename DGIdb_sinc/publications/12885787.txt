by diffusion (1) and so relies on the operation of the norepinephrine transporter (net)1 for uptake into cells. clearance by this
integral membrane protein constitutes the major mechanism for
the termination of action of this neurotransmitter at noradrenergic synapses (2), and disturbances in the functioning of the
net are associated with pathological states including depression
(3), congestive heart failure (4), and orthostatic intolerance, and
tachycardia (5). known inhibitors of the net include antidepressants (e.g. desipramine and nisoxetine), the appetite suppressant
 xxxd2546xxx , and the abused drug cocaine (for review, see ref. 6).
the net, together with the  xxxg2149xxx  (dat) and the
serotonin transporter (sert), forms a family of na⫹- and cl⫺dependent monoamine transporters.
a novel peptidic net inhibitor, ␹-mria, has been identified
in cone snail venom (7). cone snails use a venom containing a
mixture of bioactive peptides (“conopeptides”) to capture their
prey, and these are known to target an array of voltage-sensitive ion channels, ligand-gated ion channels, and g proteincoupled receptors (for review, see ref. 8). intrathecal injection
of ␹-mria has been found to be analgesic in hot plate and
neuropathic pain models (9, 10). the inhibition of [3h]norepinephrine uptake by the net caused by ␹-mria was found to be
non-competitive, reducing the maximum rate of transport and
not affecting the affinity of the transporter for substrate (7).
the non-competitive mode of action of ␹-mria distinguishes it
from the majority of the classically described inhibitors of the
net that act in a competitive fashion. in this study, we explored the interaction of ␹-mria with the monoamine transporters to gain an insight into the selectivity, na⫹ dependence,
site of action, and structure-activity relationship of the
conopeptide.

␹-conopeptide mria (␹-mria) is a 13-residue peptide
contained in the venom of the predatory marine snail
conus marmoreus that has been found to inhibit the norepinephrine transporter (net). we investigated whether
␹-mria targeted the other members of the monoamine
transporter family and found no effect of the peptide (100
␮m) on the activity of the  xxxg2149xxx  and the
serotonin transporter, indicating a high specificity of action. the binding of the net inhibitors, [3h]nisoxetine
and [3h] xxxd2546xxx , to the expressed rat and human net
was inhibited by ␹-mria with the conopeptide displaying
a slight preference toward the rat isoform. for both radioligands, saturation binding studies showed that the
inhibition by ␹-mria was competitive in nature. it has
previously been demonstrated that ␹-mria does not compete with norepinephrine, unlike classically described
net inhibitors such as nisoxetine and  xxxd2546xxx  that do.
this pattern of behavior implies that the binding site for
␹-mria on the net overlaps the antidepressant binding
site and is wholly distinct from the substrate binding site.
the inhibitory effect of ␹-mria was found to be dependent
on naⴙ with the conopeptide becoming a less effective
blocker of [3h]norepinephrine by the net under the conditions of reduced extracellular naⴙ. in this respect,
␹-mria is similar to the antidepressant inhibitors of the
net. the structure-activity relationship of ␹-mria was
investigated by alanine scanning. four residues in the
first cysteine-bracketed loop of ␹-mria and a his in loop 2
played a dominant role in the interaction between ␹-mria
and the net. h␣ chemical shift comparisons indicated
that side-chain interactions at these key positions were
structurally perturbed by the replacement of gly-6. from
these data, we present a model of the structure of ␹-mria
that shows the relative orientation of the key binding
residues. this model provides a new molecular caliper for
probing the structure of the net.

onto gf/b filters (wallac, boston, ma) pretreated with 0.6% polyethylenimine. filter mats were washed three times with ice-cold buffer
containing 25 mm hepes, 125 mm nacl, ph 7.4, and allowed to dry.
filter-retained radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation
counting. for saturation analysis experiments, the binding reactions
contained 6 ␮g of membrane protein from rat net-transfected cos-7
cells, either [3h]nisoxetine (4 –100 nm) or [3h] xxxd2546xxx  (5– 86 nm) and
␹-mria (0, 2, or 20 ␮m). in other experiments, rat brain homogenates
(equivalent to 20 ␮g of protein/well) and [3h]nisoxetine (4.3 nm) were
incubated together in the absence and presence of unlabeled nisoxetine,
desipramine, or ␹-mria (1 pm–100 ␮m) in buffer containing 50 mm
tris䡠hcl, 300 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, ph 7.4, for 1 h at room temperature.
the reactions were filtered, and the radioactivity counted as described
above.

h nmr spectroscopy—all of the spectra were recorded on a bruker
arx 500 spectrometer equipped with a z-gradient unit. peptide concentrations were ⬃2 mm. each analog was examined in 95% h2o, 5%
d2o, ph 3.0 –3.5. the 1h nmr experiments recorded were noesy (18,
19) with a mixing time of 400 ms and tocsy (20) with a mixing time
of 65–120 ms. all of the spectra were recorded at 293 k and were run
over 6024 hz (500 mhz) with 4096 data points, 512 free induction
decays, 16 – 80 scans, and a recycle delay of 1 s.
the solvent was suppressed using the watergate sequence (21).
spectra were processed using xwinmr. free induction decays were
multiplied by a polynomial function and apodised using a 90° shifted
sine-bell function in both dimensions prior to fourier transformation.
base-line correction using a fifth order polynomial was applied. chemical shift values were referenced internally to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapetane-5-sulfonate at 0.00 ppm. the peptides were assigned according to
the method of wüthrich (22). secondary h␣ shifts were compared with
the random coil shift values of wishart et al. (23).
materials—desipramine hydrochloride,  xxxd2338xxx ,
 xxxd2546xxx , nisoxetine hydrochloride, (⫺)- xxxd2750xxx , and
 xxxd2850xxx  were obtained from sigma. u-0521 and gbr-12909 dihydrochloride were from biomol (plymouth meeting, pa). l-[7-3h]norepinephrine (specific activity, 14.9 ci/mmol), 5-[1,2-3h(n)]hydroxytryptamine creatinine sulfate ([3h]serotonin) (specific activity,
24.0 ci/mmol), 3,4-[7-3h]dihydroxyphenylethylamine ([3h]dopamine)
(specific activity, 27.5 ci/mmol), [3h] xxxd2546xxx  (specific activity, 21 ci/
mmol), and [3h]nisoxetine (specific activity, 80 ci/mmol) were obtained
from perkinelmer life sciences. protected fmoc-amino acid derivatives were from novabiochem or auspep (melbourne, australia). the
following side-chain protected amino acids were used: cys( xxxd3319xxx ),
asn(trt), his(trt), hyp( xxxd3319xxx ), tyr( xxxd3319xxx ), and lys(boc). dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, diisopropylethylamine, and trifluoroacetic
acid, were all of peptide synthesis grade supplied by auspep. hbtu was
fluka 12804 supplied by sigma. high performance liquid chromatography grade acetonitrile and methanol was supplied by sigma. resin
used was fmoc-rink amide resin supplied by polymer laboratories.
triisopropylsilane was from aldrich.
statistics and data analysis—data are expressed as means ⫾ s.e. of
results obtained from 2 to 5 separate experiments. student’s two-tailed
t test or, where appropriate, anova with post hoc t tests performed by
the tukey method was used to evaluate the statistical significance of
differences between groups. values of p ⬍ 0.05 were considered significant. curve fitting of concentration-response curves and radioligand
binding data was performed by non-linear regression using individual
data points with prism 3.0 software for macintosh (graphpad, san
diego, ca). the equation of cheng and prusoff (24) was used to convert
ic50 values to ki values.
results

effect of ␹-mria on the cellular uptake of [3h]monoamines—
cos-1 cells transfected with either the rat or human net
readily accumulated [3h]norepinephrine, and nonspecific uptake of [3h]norepinephrine was ⬍2.5% of the total uptake. as
shown in fig. 1, the uptake of [3h]norepinephrine via the rat
and human net was sensitive to inhibition by ␹-mria with
pic50 values of 6.21 ⫾ 0.02 (rat; n ⫽ 3) and 5.90 ⫾ 0.03 (human;
n ⫽ 3). ␹-mria acted as a full inhibitor of the net of both
species. for dat- and sert-transfected cells, nonspecific uptake represented ⬍6% of the total [3h]norepinephrine accumulation. in the presence of ␹-mria (100 ␮m), the rate of uptake of
[3h]dopamine by the human dat and [3h]serotonin by the
human sert was not significantly altered (fig. 1b).

was deprotected and cleaved from the resin by stirring at room temperature in trifluoroacetic acid:h2o:triisopropylsilane:ethanedithiol (90:5:
2.5:2.5) for 2–3 h. cold  xxxd2052xxx  was then added to the mixture, and
the peptide precipitated out. the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and subsequently washed with further cold  xxxd2052xxx  to
remove scavengers. the final product was dissolved in 50% aqueous
acetonitrile and lyophilized to yield a fluffy white solid. the crude,
reduced peptide was examined by reverse phase high performance
liquid chromatography for purity, and the correct molecular weight was
confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. pure, reduced peptides
were oxidized, and the major peak was purified to ⬎95% purity and
characterized by high performance liquid chromatography prior to further use.
cellular uptake of [3h]monoamines—cos-1 cells (atcc, manassas,
va) were grown in 24-well plates (falcon, bc biosciences) containing
dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine
serum (invitrogen) at 37 °c in 5% co2. upon reaching ⬃85% confluency, the cells were transiently transfected with plasmid dna encoding
the human net (13), the rat net (14), the human dat (15), or the
human sert (16). transfections were performed using lipofectamine
2000 reagent (invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol using
800 ng of dna/well. assays measuring the cellular accumulation of the
transporters’ respective [3h]monoamine substrates were performed
24 h after transfection at room temperature in duplicate. the culture
medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times with 500
␮l of transport buffer containing 125 mm nacl, 4.8 mm kcl, 1.2 mm
 xxxd2534xxx , 1.2 mm kh2po4, 1.3 mm cacl2, 25 mm hepes, 5.55 mm
d-(⫹)-glucose, 1.02 mm  xxxd228xxx , 10 ␮m u-0521 (to inhibit catecholo-methyl transferase), and 100 ␮m  xxxd2850xxx  (to inhibit monoamine
oxidase), ph 7.4. in experiments examining the na⫹ dependence of the
net inhibitors, the concentration of nacl used in the transport buffer
ranged from 25 to 125 mm with appropriate concentrations of licl
added to retain equal osmolarity. inhibitor drugs were preincubated
with the cells for 15 min before the addition of 100 nm [3h]monoamine
substrate (supplemented with unlabeled substrate as required). the
final volume was 250 ␮l. nonspecific uptake of [3h]norepinephrine by
net-transfected cells was defined by the accumulation occurring in the
presence of 10⫺4 m desipramine. imipramine (10⫺6 m) and gbr-12909
(10⫺6 m) were used to determine the amount of nonspecific uptake of
[3h]serotonin by sert-transfected cells and [3h]dopamine uptake by
dat-transfected cells, respectively. transfected cells were exposed to
[3h]monoamine substrate for either 8 min (rat net, human sert) or
15 min (human net, human dat). the selection of these incubation
times was based on the results of pilot studies that showed that the
relationship between uptake and time was linear over these periods
(data not shown). the solution containing unaccumulated 3h-substrate
was then rapidly removed, and the cells were washed three times with
1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. the cells were lysed with
0.1% triton x-100 in 10 mm tris䡠hcl, ph 7.5, for 60 min at room
temperature with gentle shaking. the level of radioactivity of the cell
lysate was determined by liquid scintillation counting.
membrane preparation—cos-7 cells (ecacc, salisbury, wiltshire,
united kingdom) were grown in 150-mm dishes and transiently transfected with 15 ␮g of plasmid dna encoding the rat net using the same
method described for the uptake experiments. membranes were prepared from cells 48 h after transfection for use in radioligand binding
experiments. after washing the cells with warm phosphate-buffered
saline, ice-cold tem buffer (10 mm tris䡠hcl, 1.4 mm egta, 12.5 mm
mgcl2, ph 7.5) was added and the cells were scraped from the dish.
cells were then homogenized using a polytron homogenizer (brinkmann instruments, westbury, ny) and centrifuged at 1000 ⫻ g for 5
min at 4 °c to remove cellular debris then at 15,000 ⫻ g for 45 min at
4 °c. pellets were washed with tem buffer and recentrifuged. the
resulting pellet was resuspended in tem buffer containing 10% glycerol. rat brain homogenates were prepared as described previously
(17). protein concentration was determined using the bca protein
assay kit (pierce, rockford, il) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
aliquots of membrane were stored at ⫺80 °c until use.
radioligand binding assays—binding reactions were set up in triplicate wells of 96-well plates. membranes from cos-7 cells transfected
with the rat or human net (6 ␮g of protein/well) were incubated with
either [3h]nisoxetine (4.3 nm) or [3h] xxxd2546xxx  (4 nm) in the absence or
presence of ␹-mria or one of its analogs (1 nm–100 ␮m) in buffer
containing 20 mm tris䡠hcl, 75 mm nacl, 0.1 mm edta, 0.1 mm egta,
0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx , ph 7.4, for 1 h at room temperature. the
final assay volume was 150 ␮l. the amount of nonspecific binding was
determined by the inclusion of desipramine (100 ␮m) in the reaction.
bound and free radioactivity were separated by rapid vacuum filtration

norepinephrine transporter inhibition by ␹-mria

effect of ␹-mria on the binding of classical net inhibitors—␹-mria inhibited the binding of [3h]nisoxetine to the
membranes of cells expressing the rat and human net (fig.
2a). the ic50 for inhibition was 500 nm (pki ⫽ 6.6 ⫾ 0.05) at the
rat net and 1.7 ␮m (pki ⫽ 6.0 ⫾ 0.04) at the human net.
[3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding to the expressed transporters was also
sensitive to ␹-mria (fig. 2b). ␹-mria inhibited binding with an
ic50 of 1.9 ␮m (pki ⫽ 6.4 ⫾ 0.03) at the rat net and 4.0 ␮m
(pki ⫽ 5.9 ⫾ 0.04) at the human net. nonspecific binding
represented ⬃3% of the total binding in all of the experiments,
and ␹-mria acted as a full inhibitor of [3h]nisoxetine and
[3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding.
saturation analysis was used to characterize the nature of
the inhibition caused by ␹-mria (fig. 3). in the absence of
␹-mria, [3h]nisoxetine bound to rat net membranes with a kd
of 4.2 ⫾ 0.5 nm and a bmax of 42 ⫾ 1.6 pmol/mg protein. the kd
was increased to 21 ⫾ 3.6 nm in the presence of 2 ␮m ␹-mria
with no significant change in the value of the bmax (45 ⫾ 4.2
pmol/mg protein). for [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding, the kd was 1.0 ⫾
0.1 nm and the bmax was 40 ⫾ 0.3 pmol/mg protein in control
experiments. in the presence of ␹-mria (20 ␮m), the kd (35 ⫾
1.5 nm) but not the bmax (41 ⫾ 0.6 pmol/mg protein) was
significantly altered. ␹-mria (10⫺6 m) did not affect the dissociation rate of [3h]nisoxetine from the expressed rat net (data
not shown).
desipramine, nisoxetine, and ␹-mria reduced the binding of
[3h]nisoxetine to rat brain homogenates in a concentration-dependent manner (fig. 4). f tests comparing the fit of the binding data to a model of one-site competition, two-site competition, or a sigmoidal curve with a variable slope indicated that
the simpler one-site competition model was preferred and more
complicated models did not significantly improve the fit (p ⬎

to identify the location but not the nature of local changes in
conformation (29). secondary h␣ chemical shifts were used in
the first instance to compare ␹-mria with its alanine-substituted analogs (fig. 7). the results indicate that the overall
global fold of the ␹-mria analogs used in this study are conserved compared with native ␹-mria with the exception of
[ xxxg617xxx ]mria where the overall fold of the peptide appears different. small local changes are observed for [k8a]mria and
[h11a]mria at the site of the altered residue. for [y7a]mria,
a small change in the secondary h␣ chemical shift is seen at
lys-8. this is not surprising as tyr-7 is a relatively large
residue that, relative to ala-7, could influence the chemical
environment of lys-8 and hence differentially influence its h␣
chemical shift. in the case of [ xxxg617xxx ]mria, a comparison of its
secondary h␣ chemical shifts with ␹-mria indicates that replacement of this residue causes a significant structural perturbation. interestingly, introduction of a stereocenter through
substitution of gly-6 with an alanine appears to alter the
structural rigidity of [ xxxg617xxx ]mria. this enhanced structural
rigidity for [ xxxg617xxx ]mria is supported by changes in secondary
h␤ shifts for residue cys-5 where the two cys-5 ␤-protons are
well separated in [ xxxg617xxx ]mria. in contrast, the other ␹-mria

sodium dependence of net inhibition—the rate of uptake of
[3h]norepinephrine by cells transfected with the human net
slowed substantially as the concentration of na⫹ in the transport buffer was reduced. at the lowest na⫹ concentration examined (25 mm), the rate of [3h]norepinephrine accumulation
was approximately half of that observed at 125 mm na⫹ (data
not shown). concentrations of desipramine and ␹-mria that
inhibited transport by 50% in assays where the buffer contained 125 mm na⫹ (4.05 nm and 1.26 ␮m, respectively) were
found to inhibit a progressively smaller proportion of the uptake in buffer containing less na⫹ (fig. 5).
effect of residue replacement on the potency of ␹-mria—
nine analogs of ␹-mria in which the non-cysteine residues
were systematically replaced with alanine were assayed for
inhibition of [3h]nisoxetine binding to the expressed human
net, and their potency was compared (fig. 6). the analogs
with substitutions at n-terminal residues outside of the
cysteine-bracketed loops ([n1a]mria, [g2a]mria, and
[v3a]mria) displayed no significant change in potency compared with ␹-mria. the replacement of any of the residues
located in the first cysteine-bracketed loop, in contrast, had a
severe impact on potency. no inhibition was observed with
these analogs ([ xxxg617xxx ]mria, [y7a]mria, [k8a]mria, and
[l9a]mria) at 100 ␮m, the highest concentration tested. assuming that the hill slope parameter for their inhibition remains unchanged compared with ␹-mria, the ic50 concentrations of these peptides will be at least an order of magnitude
greater still, yielding a conservative estimate of 10⫺3 m. alanine substitution of the first residue of the second cysteinebracketed loop (analog [h11a]mria) caused a ⬃60-fold reduction in potency. replacement of the other residue in this loop
(analog [o12a]mria) did not have a significant effect on potency. two further analogs were assayed to investigate the
effect of replacement with residues other than alanine at positions 7 and 8. the potency of [y7f]mria was ⬃3.8-fold lower
(pic 50 ⫽ 5.2 ⫾ 0.08) than ␹ -mria, and the potency of
[k8r]mria was ⬃6.8-fold lower (pic50 ⫽ 4.9 ⫾ 0.10) than
␹-mria.

recorded at 500 mhz and subsequently assigned using the
sequential assignment protocol (22). secondary chemical shifts,
i.e. h␣ chemical shifts compared with random coil values (25),
are a sensitive measure of backbone conformation (26 –28) and
can provide an indication whether the overall global fold of a
series of a peptide is maintained (29). for a series of structurally related peptides, secondary h␣ chemical shifts can be used

human net were exposed to [3h]norepinephrine (100 nm) contained in
buffer in which various amounts of na⫹ had been isotonically replaced
with li⫹. specific uptake of [3h]norepinephrine occurring in the presence of desipramine (䡬, 4.05 nm) and ␹-mria (f, 1.26 ␮m) was expressed as a percentage of the uptake occurring in the absence of the
inhibitors at each extracellular na⫹ concentration tested. nonspecific

discussion

the aim of the present study was to investigate the influence
that the transporter identity, the co-substrate na⫹, and individual residues of ␹-mria have on the ability of the conopeptide
to inhibit monoamine transporters. whether ␹-mria acted
through a site on the net that was distinct from the classical
inhibitors of the net was also examined. ␹-mria inhibited
uptake by the net of both species studied and was found for
expressed transporters to act with twice the potency at the rat
over the human isoform. the amino acid sequence homology
between the nets of the two species is 93% (14). the net is
related to the transporters for the other monoamine neurotransmitters, dopamine and serotonin. the amino acid identity
between the human net and the human dat is 66% (15), and
between the human net and human sert, the homology is
43% (16). because a substantial number of inhibitors of the
net have relatively low specificity and also target the dat,
the sert, or both (30), the effect of ␹-mria on transport by the
human dat and sert was of interest. our finding that
␹-mria at a concentration of 100 ␮m, which is ⬃90 times the
ic50 for inhibition of [3h]norepinephrine transport by the net,
did not significantly affect the operation of either the dat or
the sert to take up their 3h-substrates demonstrates that
␹-mria acts with a very high degree of specificity. it also
demonstrates that the action of ␹-mria is not an indirect one to
inhibit transport by a more general mechanism such as disturbing the transmembrane ionic gradients that are coupled to
transport because this would influence the activity of all three
transporters (31, 32). unlike ␹-mria, the peptidic transporter
inhibitors identified by koppel et al. (33) and rothman et al.
(34) from combinatorial chemistry libraries do not discriminate
between individual members of the  xxxg2099xxx  family, targeting both the dat and the sert
with ic50 values in the micromolar range. their activity at the
net has not been reported.
we previously showed that the inhibition of the net by
␹-mria is reversible and non-competitive with respect to substrate (7). this non-competitive mode of action distinguishes
␹-mria from classical net inhibitors including cocaine,  xxxd2546xxx , nisoxetine, and other antidepressants, which are competitive inhibitors of [3h]norepinephrine uptake (2, 35–37). here,
radioligand binding experiments have revealed that ␹-mria
acts competitively with respect to [3h]nisoxetine and

[3h] xxxd2546xxx  indicated by the effect of ␹-mria to increase the
apparent kd for the binding of the radioligands to the expressed
rat net without reducing the value of the bmax. consistent
with functional experiments, ␹-mria is a somewhat more potent inhibitor at the rat net than the human net. the identification of various residues of the net that affect substrate
and antidepressant affinity either jointly or separately (38 – 42)
indicates that the antidepressant binding site partially overlaps the substrate binding site. our finding that ␹-mria competes with nisoxetine and  xxxd2546xxx  but not norepinephrine
implies that the ␹-mria binding site is wholly distinct from the
substrate binding site but shares some identity with the antidepressant binding site. the results from recent site-directed
mutagenesis experiments with the human net (43), in which
the affinities of some of the mutant transporters for ␹-mria,
desipramine, and cocaine were found to change in parallel and
others change selectively for the different ligands, provide further support for a partial overlap among the ␹-mria, desipramine, and cocaine binding sites.
although the potency of ␹-mria for inhibition of uptake and
radioligand binding to the expressed rat net observed here
closely matches its reported potency for potentiating noradrenergic contractions in the isolated rat vas deferens (430 nm; 7),
we found that the potency of ␹-mria for inhibition of the
binding of [3h]nisoxetine to rat brain was an order of magnitude lower. given its lower potency in the rat brain, its only
partial inhibitory effect and the modest degree of assumed
specific (i.e. nisoxetine- or desipramine-sensitive) binding in
the assay, it is perhaps not surprising that mcintosh et al. (9)
did not detect any effect of ␹-mria (10 ␮m) in their net binding
assay using conditions somewhat similar to those used here. a
possible reason for the only partial inhibition of the specific
[3h]nisoxetine binding by ␹-mria is the additional binding of
desipramine and nisoxetine to sites in the rat brain other than
the net such as ␣1-adrenoceptors (44) or the sert (30), which
are not also targeted by ␹-mria. alternatively, the classical
net inhibitors may bind at multiple sites on the net in a
manner reminiscent of the interaction of the cocaine analog
rti-55 and the sert (45) with ␹-mria blocking only a subset
of these sites. our finding that ␹-mria acts as a full inhibitor of
the desipramine-sensitive [3h]nisoxetine binding to rat nettransfected cell membranes (fig. 2a) discounts this hypothesis
or at least reflects a difference in the presentation of the net
in the membranes of native tissues and transfected cells or
even the existence of net subtypes in the rat. the existence of
such subtypes could explain the unexpected reduction in the
potency of ␹-mria observed in the brain binding assay.
norepinephrine transport by the net has been shown to be
dependent on na⫹, reflecting the co-transport of na⫹ with the
substrate (46). the reduced transport activity caused by lowering of the extracellular na⫹ concentration is mediated
through an increase in the apparent km for norepinephrine and
a reduction in the vmax. extracellular na⫹ not only affects the
affinity of the transporter for substrate but also its affinity for
inhibitors. it has previously been shown that desipramine and
other antidepressants become less effective inhibitors of uptake
with reduced extracellular na⫹ (47), an observation confirmed
in this study. ␹-mria demonstrates the same pattern of na⫹
dependence. these findings may signify that desipramine and
␹-mria target the outward-facing (substrate-accessible) configuration of the transporter whose adoption is promoted by extracellular na⫹ (31). the na⫹ dependence of the inhibitory
action of ␹-mria stands in contrast to that of cocaine, another
natural product that inhibits the net. cocaine competes with
na⫹ for binding to the net, becoming a more potent inhibitor
of transport as extracellular na⫹ decreases (47).

tons (data not shown). the relative position of the side chains
of tyr-7, lys-8, leu-9, and his-11 of ␹-mrib (equivalent to
␹-mria in structure (7)) are shown in fig. 8.

norepinephrine transporter inhibition by ␹-mria

the three-dimensional structure of ␹-mria has not been
determined but appears very similar to that of ␹-mrib (7), a
conopeptide whose sequence differs by only a single residue at
the n terminus and that displays very similar pharmacology to
␹-mria. similar to the majority of conopeptides, ␹-mria contains multiple cysteine residues that are linked by intramolecular disulfide bonds. these bonds act to bring the cysteine pairs
into close proximity in the core of the peptide with residues in
the intercysteine regions exposed as loops. alanine scanning
reveals a critical role for residues in the first and largest of
␹-mria’s two cysteine-bracketed loops in contributing to the
activity of the peptide at the net. substitution of any of the
residues in this region with alanine results in a loss of potency
predicted to be in excess of ⬃600-fold. with the exception of the
replacement of gly-6, the alanine substitutions did not affect
the structure of the peptide backbone to any great degree.
tyr-7, lys-8, leu-9, and to a lesser extent his-11 therefore
seem likely to directly interact with the transporter, whereas
gly-6 probably plays a structural role to allow the correct
orientation of the other residues in the loop for better net
binding. the involvement of tyrosine and lysine residues in the
high affinity interaction of other peptide toxins with their targets has been reported previously (48, 49), warranting further
investigation into ␹-mria’s use of these residues as high affinity binding determinants in experiments with additional analogs. phenylalanine was found to be able to largely substitute
for tyr-7, indicating that the hydroxyl group of the tyrosine
residue is not of critical importance for binding. this stands in
contrast to its role in the interaction of the ␻-conotoxins with
the cav2.3 channel (48). the replacement of arginine with
lysine at position 8 had a relatively small detrimental effect on
potency, showing that the side-chain charge may be a key
determinant for binding at this position and that length is less
influential.
examination of the relative positions of the key binding
determinants in ␹-mria (fig. 8) reveals a highly exposed lys-8
flanked by three hydrophobic residues to form the pharmacophore. given its exposed position, it is possible that lys-8
could direct the binding into a pore, perhaps reminiscent of how
toxins such as charybdotoxin block the movement of k⫹ ions
through voltage-dependent channels (49). if this is indeed correct as suggested by bryan-lluka et al. (43), ␹-conopeptides

might be useful molecular calipers to probe the size of the
norepinephrine permeation pathway. the majority of transporter residues that have been found to influence tricyclic
antidepressant binding lie in the predicted transmembrane
domains of the net (e.g. 41, 52, 53). that the binding site of the
antidepressants overlaps with that of norepinephrine, yet the
binding site of ␹-mria does not, is consistent with the
␹-conopeptides acting to inhibit transport by blocking the access of norepinephrine to the substrate permeation pathway by
binding less deeply in the pore of the transporter than do the
classical small molecule inhibitors.
in summary, this study has shown that inhibition of monoamine transport by ␹-mria is confined to that mediated by the
net. accordingly, the ␹-mria binding site on the net seems
likely to consist, at least partly, of residues that are not conserved between the net and either the dat or the sert.
because ␹-mria acts non-competitively with respect to norepinephrine yet competitively with the classical net inhibitors
nisoxetine and  xxxd2546xxx , which themselves are competitive
inhibitors of norepinephrine uptake, the binding site of ␹-mria
is predicted to be distinct from the substrate binding site but to
share some commonality with the antidepressant binding site.
the na⫹ dependence exhibited by ␹-mria indicates some similarity in its interaction with the net to that of the antidepressants. specific residues in loop one of ␹-mria have been identified that directly interact with the net or are important for
the maintenance of a suitable peptide structure capable of
recognizing the transporter. furthermore, elucidation of how
the ␹-mria peptide binds to and inhibits the net will reveal
important structural and mechanistic information regarding
the monoamine transporters which, at present, are poorly
understood.
