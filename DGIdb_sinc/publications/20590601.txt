background and purpose: current strategies to ameliorate cardiac ischaemic and reperfusion damage, including block of the
sodium-hydrogen exchanger, are therapeutically ineffective. here we propose a different approach, block of the persistent
sodium current (inap).
experimental approach: left ventricular pressure was measured as an index of functional deficit in isolated, langendorff
perfused, hearts from adult rats, subjected to 30 min global ischaemia and reperfusion with vehicle only (control) or riluzole
(1–10 mm) in the perfusate. cell shortening and intracellular ca2+ concentrations [ca2+]i were measured in adult rat isolated
myocytes subjected to hypoxia and re-oxygenation. the block of transient and persistent sodium currents by concentrations
of riluzole between 0.01 and 100 mm were assessed in rat isolated myocytes using patch clamp techniques.
key results: in perfused hearts, riluzole produced a concentration-dependent cardioprotective action, with minor protection
from 1 mm and produced rapid and almost complete recovery upon reperfusion from 3 and 10 mm. in isolated myocytes,
riluzole at 3 and 10 mm greatly attenuated or prevented the hypoxia- and reperfusion-induced rise in [ca2+]i and the
contractile deficit. in patch clamp experiments, riluzole blocked the persistent sodium current with an ic50 of 2.7 mm, whereas
the block of the transient sodium current was only apparent at concentrations above 30 mm.
conclusions and implications: riluzole preferentially blocked inap and was protective in cardiac ischaemia and reperfusion.
thus block of the persistent sodium current would be a viable method of ameliorating cardiac ischaemic and reperfusion
damage.

introduction

pressure (lvedp) to about 80 mmhg from a control value of
about 10 mmhg and a prolonged calcium transient (meissner
and morgan, 1995). these observations have subsequently
generally been confirmed (saini and dhalla, 2005), although
other groups have disputed whether the increased [ca2+]i is
directly related to the increased diastolic tension (eberli et al.,
2000), pointing out that the situation is complicated by
changes in myofilament calcium sensitivity. nevertheless, it is
a consistent observation that post-ischaemic myocardium displays an increase in [ca2+]i. the increase in [ca2+]i appears to
follow, and depend upon, a preceding increase in [na+]i. the
mechanistic link proposed is that an increased [na+]i reduces
the electrochemical gradient for na+ which normally drives
the sodium-calcium exchanger, ncx (lazdunski et al., 1985),

reperfusion of myocardium after a period of ischaemia (postischaemic myocardium) often results in an increase in cellular
damage and functional impairment. for example, in the rat,
post-ischaemic myocardium displays an elevated diastolic
calcium to about 0.5 mm from control values of about 0.3 mm
accompanied by an increased left ventricular end-diastolic

and there is now a great deal of supporting evidence for this.
however, the source of the increased [na+]i is still not clear. it
is unlikely that reduction or cessation of function of the
na-katpase alone is sufficient, and it appears that an abnormal influx of na+ occurs (rather than merely a failure of na+
extrusion), particularly during reperfusion. one mechanism
that can produce an abnormal na+ influx is the enhanced
activity of the sodium-hydrogen exchanger, nhe1 (xiao and
allen, 2000; murphy and allen, 2009). with this in mind,
there has been considerable effort at developing compounds
aimed at blocking nhe1 as a protective strategy against reperfusion damage, such as cariporide. in animal experiments,
nhe1 blockers are reasonably effective at ameliorating reperfusion damage (hartmann and decking, 1999), but clinical
trials with these agents have been disappointing (theroux
et al., 2000; zeymer et al., 2001). this may be because another
source of na+ influx contributes to the rise in [na+]i during
ischaemia and/or reperfusion. previous reports have suggested
that this could be because of the persistent sodium current
(inap). this current is carried by a non-inactivating na+
channel, also known as the ttx-sensitive na+ channel, which
is activated in hypoxia (ju et al., 1996b) and although the
amplitude of the current through this channel is small (in the
order of a hundred pa), its persistence when the channel is
activated permits a significant rise in [na+]i. moreover low
doses of ttx, which block this current, have been shown to
reduce the rise in [na+]i in hypoxia as well as, and in synergy
with, cariporide (eigel and hadley, 1999). ttx is not practical
as a cardioprotective agent because of its high potency to
block neuronal sodium channels and produce brain death but
an agent specific for the persistent channel may have therapeutic potential.
here we report on a potential novel cardioprotective agent,
riluzole, which appears to act via a selective block of inap.
riluzole has been shown to be protective against neuronal
ischaemia in a variety of models (bae et al., 2000; baptiste and
fehlings, 2006; heurteaux et al., 2006). this effect of riluzole
is generally thought to be because of its ability to block
glutamate release (ª10 mm) and/or postsynaptic nmda
receptors ic50 ª 18 mm] (bryson et al., 1996; doble, 1996;
lamanauskas and nistri, 2008), although a variety of other
mechanisms have been proposed, including activation of
g-protein dependent signal transduction (doble, 1996), inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation (ic50 ª 0.5 mm) (peyclit
et al., 2001), activation of the tandem pore k+ channels
traak and  xxxg1256xxx  (ª100 mm) (duprat et al., 2000) and inhibition of neuronal sodium channels (8 mg·kg-1 i.p. in rat)
(ates et al., 2007). although riluzole can protect the retina
from neurodegeration induced by ischaemia (izumi et al.,
2003), there is, at present, no data on whether riluzole may be
protective against ischaemia in tissues other than neuronal
tissues. here we show that riluzole is cardioprotective in isolated rat hearts and prevents the rise in [ca2+]i induced in
single myocytes by hypoxia and re-oxygenation. riluzole also
blocked inap in single myocytes, with more than 10-fold
greater potency than block of the transient sodium current
(inat). furthermore, the optimal concentration for all of
these effects was about the same (ª3 mm). we therefore
suggest that riluzole ameliorates ischaemic and reperfusion
damage as a result of its block of inap in the heart.

methods
all animal care and experimental procedures for these experiments conformed to the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals published by the us national institutes of health
(nih publication no. 85-23, revised 1996) and were approved
by the animal ethics committees of the university of adelaide and leeds university.

isolated heart
male sprague-dawley rats weighing 350 to 450 g were anaesthetized by i.p injection of 30 mg·kg-1 sodium pentobarbitone
with 2000 units of heparin. when deeply anesthetized, the
hearts were removed and perfused via the aorta in a langendorff apparatus. hearts were paced at 4 hz by stimulation of
the right atrium. an intraventricular saline-filled balloon was
placed in the left ventricle through an incision in the left
atrium for measurement of left ventricular pressure. coronary
flow was maintained  xxxd1891xxx  ml·min-1 (except during
ischaemia). the perfusate had the composition (in mm):
cacl2 1.5, nacl 111.0, kcl 4.0, mgcl2 0.6, nahco3 23.9,
nah2po4 1.2, d-glucose 12.0 and was equilibrated with 95%
o2 and 5% co2 the whole apparatus was contained in a
humidified temperature controlled chamber at 37°c. global
ischaemia was induced by stopping the perfusion pump. riluzole (sigma pharmaceuticals, st. louis, mo, usa) was dissolved in a stock solution of  xxxd3034xxx  (peg; sigma
pharmaceuticals)  xxxd1891xxx  mm, and diluted slowly into the perfusate while stirring to achieve the final concentration. riluzole was present in the perfusate at either 1, 3 or 10 mm (n =
4 per group) throughout the experiment, and control solutions (n = 4) contained the vehicle alone at the same concentration as the highest used in the experimental solutions. the
vehicle at this concentration had no observable effect on the
hearts.
in a separate series of experiments, epicardial monophasic
action potentials (maps) were recorded from the surface of
the left ventricle in isolated hearts with control perfusate, and
with riluzole added to the perfusate at 3, 10 and 30 mm (n = 6).
data was digitized at 2 khz using ‘powerlab’ hardware and
software from ad instruments (sydney, australia). measurements of left ventricular pressure (lvp) and the differential of
lvp (dlvp/dt) were made during normal perfusion, during
ischaemia, and 1 min after reperfusion, by averaging the measured variables over 10 consecutive beats. action potential
duration (apd) measurements were made with the ‘peak
parameters’ add-on module for chart 5 (ad instruments) all
measurements were made without knowledge of the treatments. data are presented as means ⫾ standard error of the
mean and statistical analysis (student’s t-test) was done in
excel (microsoft). significance was taken at p < 0.05.

measurement of [ca2+]i and contraction in single
isolated myocytes
myocytes were isolated from adult wistar rat hearts as
described previously (mccrossan et al., 2004). the freshly isolated myocytes were incubated with 2 mm fura 4-am (molecubritish journal of pharmacology (2010) 160 1072–1082

lar probes, eugene, or, usa) and gently shaken for 20 min at
room temperature (20–24°c). cells were then resuspended in
a hepes-based solution (see further discussion) and left in the
dark for 30 min before use to allow for de-esterification of the
dye. myocytes were placed on the stage of a nikon eclipse
microscope for simultaneous recording of cell length and
[ca2+]i. cells were field stimulated at 2 hz at 120% threshold
voltage. for all measurements, cells were superfused continuously at 37°c with a hepes-based solution containing (in
mm): 137 nacl; 5.4 kcl; 0.33 nah2po4; 0.5 mgcl2; 5 hepes;
5.6 glucose; 1 cacl2 at ph 7.4. cell length was monitored
using a video-edge detector (crescent electronics, salt lake
city, ut, usa). for the [ca2+]i measurement, myocytes
were alternately illuminated at 340 and 380 nm, using an
optoscan monochromator (cairn research, kent, uk). the
fluorescent emission at 510 nm was collected by a photomultiplier tube and the ratio of emitted light in response to
excitation at 340 and 380 nm was calculated to provide an
index of [ca2+]i. in order to induce hypoxia, the superfusate
was bubbled with 100% n2, which was also blown over the
surface of the partially closed experimental chamber to maintain a low po2 (ª28 mmhg) in the experimental chamber. low
po2 was confirmed by measuring samples of the perfusate
using a blood gas analyser (bayer rapid lab 348, siemens
healthcare diagnostics, deerfield, il, usa). myocytes were
exposed to an o2-bubbled solution for 10 min. to record prehypoxic values, the superfusing solution was then vigorously
bubbled with 100% n2 for 20 min. (or until the cell stopped
contracting), finally the solution was re-bubbled with o2 and
responses monitored for 20 min (or until cell death). cell
contractions and [ca2+]i were recorded at 5 min. intervals. the
protocol was performed in the absence and the presence of 1,
3 and 10 mm riluzole (sigma), prepared as above.
[ca2+]i in each group for all time points was compared with
analysis of variance, and the differences between groups compared with t-tests. the number of cells ‘surviving’ (i.e. contracting) was compared with an overall exact chi-squared test
(3 d.f.), which was highly statistically significant (p < 0.001),
followed by pairwise comparisons between the control and
each concentration group using a fisher exact test (two-sided).

patch clamp experiments
myocytes were isolated from adult rat hearts as noted earlier.
when required, cells were transferred to the recording
chamber on the stage of an inverted microscope. sodium
currents were recorded in whole cell patch clamp mode using
an axopatch 200b amplifier (molecular devices, sunnyvale,
ca, usa), with borosilicate electrodes having resistances of
<1 m w. whole cell capacitance and series resistance compensation was achieved using the controls on the amplifier. the
signal was filtered at 1 khz and recorded at 12 bit resolution
at 2 khz. recording was only performed if series resistance
compensation of at least 90% could be achieved.

cscl, 5; ph adjusted to 7.4 with 5.0 m naoh. the pipette
solution for both inap and inat recording contained (mm):
csf, 120; hepes, 10; mgcl2, 2; na2-egta, 20; cacl2, 2; ph
adjusted to 7.4 with 5.0 m naoh. experiments were carried
out at room temperature (24°c).
riluzole, prepared as earlier, was added to the bath solution,
which continuously perfused the bath (volume c. 0.5 ml) at a
rate of 1 ml·min-1. hypoxia was induced by bubbling the
perfusate with 100% n2 and also blowing a gentle stream of n2
across the surface of the bath solution while maintaining the
bath perfusion.
inap was elicited by stepping the membrane potential from
a holding potential of -90 to -20 mv for 250 ms. inap was
measured for each cell by averaging the current amplitude
over the period from 170 to 250 ms after the voltage step and
this was in turn averaged over 6 consecutive recordings taken
5 s apart. leak correction was done by correcting the current
excursion produced by a 10 ms, 20 mv pulse given 100 ms
prior to the test pulse using the amplifier controls. data were
then averaged over six consecutive inap cycles recorded 6 s
apart. it was not generally possible to hold one cell long
enough to produce a cumulative c-e curve for block of inap
in a single cell. rather, the curve was constructed from as
many recordings that could be obtained in different cells.
using a similar configuration but with a lower extracellular
sodium concentration in the bath solution as detailed above,
inat was generated by stepping the membrane potential to
-20 mv from a holding potential of -140 mv for 200 ms. to
generate activation and inactivation curves, either the
holding potential or the test potential were incremented with
each pulse, delivered at 1 s intervals. data points for each
curve were fitted with boltzman distributions by least squares
non-linear regression.

ecg intervals in pigs
ecgs were monitored and recorded (data translation) in landrace pigs (20–35 kg, either sex). ecg intervals were measured
(in seconds) by averaging five consecutive rr, pr, qrs and
qtc intervals in each animal 50 min after an ip dose of
8 mg·kg-1 riluzole (n = 6) or injection of vehicle only (n = 10).
this dose of riluzole was also highly effective in reducing
ischaemia-induced arrhythmias and infarct size (data not
shown).

results
riluzole protects against ischaemia-reperfusion damage in
isolated hearts
exposing isolated hearts to 30 min of global ischaemia followed by reperfusion produced a substantial functional deficit
in control hearts. in each control heart there was an obvious
contracture immediately upon reperfusion, as demonstrated
by a pronounced increased in diastolic lvp, with very little or
no pulse pressure. this was followed by a moderate recovery
of pulse pressure after several minutes, but diastolic pressure
failed to return to normal [figure 1a (i)]. adding 1 mm riluzole
to the perfusate did not substantially alter the observed
results. however, adding 3 mm or 10 mm riluzole to the perfu-

isolated heart over time. the height of the black band illustrates the
excursion from diastolic pressure to systolic pressure (individual beats
cannot be seen on the time scale used). panel (i) shows the response of
an untreated heart to global ischaemia and reperfusion. the perfusion
pump was stopped for 30 min at the time indicated, and restarted as
indicated. panel (ii) shows an example of the same experiment in
which a different heart was perfused with 10 mm riluzole for 10 min
prior to stopping the pump. (b) the experiment depicted in a was
repeated in 16 hearts (4 with each concentration of riluzole). diastolic
lvp (lvpmin) and systolic lvp (lvpmax) (upper panel) and their first
derivatives, rate of relaxation (–dlvp/dt) and rate of contraction
(+dlvp/dt) (lower panel) were measured during normal perfusion,
after 30 min of global ischaemia (just before reperfusion) and 2 min
after reperfusion. data is shown as mean ⫾ standard error of the mean.
statistical significance is discussed in the text.

sate before inducing global ischaemia virtually eliminated the
contracture on reperfusion and maintained the diastolic pressure during the recovery period at pre-ischaemia levels. moreover, in the presence of 3 or 10 mm riluzole, pulse pressure

returned almost immediately upon reperfusion [figure 1a (ii)]
the times taken for pulse pressure to return following reperfusion are shown in table 1. although 1 mm produced some
reduction in the time needed for pulse pressure to return (not
significant), 3 and 10 mm riluzole almost eliminated this
recovery time (p < 0.002) (table 1).
figure 1b (upper panel) shows comparative lvp results
(diastolic, systolic and pulse pressures) for the control, 1, 3
and 10 mm riluzole groups (n = 4 each group). of particular
interest are the changes in diastolic pressures between preischaemia and reperfusion. the rises in diastolic pressure
upon reperfusion in both the control and 1 mm groups were
highly significant (p << 0.01) (and not significantly different
from each other), whereas there were no changes in diastolic
pressures for the 3 and 10 mm groups (p = 0.13 and 0.85,
respectively). during the ischaemic period, diastolic pressure
significantly decreased in the 3 and 10 mm groups as compared with the control group (p = 0.004 and p = 0.006, respectively), whereas with 1 mm riluzole, diastolic pressure was not
significantly different (p = 0.13).
the systolic pressures immediately after reperfusion were
significantly higher than during pre-ischaemia for each of the
control, 1, 3 and 10 mm groups (p < 0.01 for all) (figure 1b
upper panel). moreover, taking into account the dramatic
reduction in diastolic pressure, 3 and 10 mm riluzole resulted
in the heart producing a pulse pressure on reperfusion considerably larger than pre-ischaemic values.
this protective effect of riluzole was also evident in the
measures of contractility (rate of increase in ventricular pressure, +dlvp/dt) and rate of relaxation (–dlvp/dt) (figure 1b
lower panel). riluzole at all concentrations increased both
rate of contraction and rate of relaxation before ischaemia
when compared with control. after reperfusion, the rate of
contraction and the rate of relaxation were significantly
increased by 3 mm and 10 mm riluzole compared with control.

riluzole attenuates hypoxic rise in myocyte [ca2+]i and
cell shortening
in the absence of riluzole, exposure of the cells to hypoxia
produced an increase in diastolic [ca2+]i and a reduction in the
amplitude of the calcium transient [figure 2 (iii)]. there was
also an associated reduction in cell shortening [figure 2 (i)].
upon re-oxygenation of the cells, diastolic [ca2+]i increased
dramatically and the calcium transient and contraction were
abolished [figure 2 (iii) and (i)]. in contrast, in the presence of
3 mm riluzole, diastolic [ca2+]i did not increase during hypoxia
and the increase upon re-oxygenation was greatly attenuated
[figure 2 (iv)]. furthermore, in the presence of 3 mm riluzole,

after 20 min of hypoxia and 20 min after reoxygenation (reperfusion).

the calcium transient [figure 2 (iv)] and the contraction
[figure 2 (ii)] persisted throughout the hypoxia and
re-oxygenation.
compiled time course data showed that riluzole produced a
concentration-dependent attenuation of the rise in diastolic
[ca2+]i seen in the control group during hypoxia (such that
with 3 and 10 mm, diastolic [ca2+]i rose very little) and a
striking concentration-dependent attenuation of the rise in
diastolic [ca2+]i which occurred in the control group on
re-oxygenation (figure 3a).
time course data on the proportion of cells contracting at
each time point showed that in control solution many cells
ceased contracting during hypoxia and only 2/17 cells were
still contracting at the end of the reoxygenation period. riluzole greatly enhanced the number of cells surviving and
maintaining contractility; in 1 mm riluzole 4/9 (not significant compared with control) were still contracting after
20 min reoxygenation, in 3 mm 9/10 (p = 0.003 compared
with control) were, and in 10 mm 10/15 were (p = 0.001
compared with control) (figure 3b).

was incremented from -140 mv to +70 mv at 2 s intervals (n = 4 for
each curve). the lines show the best fit of the equation y = (vm –

70 mv after 4 iterations at each step (n = 4 for each curve). data is
normalized to the maximum current for each group. lines show the

block of inat was much less with 10 mm riluzole than with
20 mm ttx.
compiled data on the block of inap by concentrations of
riluzole over the range 0.01 mm to 10 mm were fitted with a
concentration-response curve with a hill coefficient of 0.5
and an ic50 of 2.7 mm (95% confidence interval 1.0 to 7.1 mm)
(figure 5c). as a comparison, the relative block required to
negate the effects of hypoxia (i.e. to reduce inap to its normoxic value) was about 38% on figure 5c, corresponding to
a riluzole concentration of between 1 and 3 mm.

other electrophysiological effects: rat isolated heart map and
ecg intervals in pigs
in normoxic rat isolated hearts (n = 6), the duration of epicardial maps at apd20, apd50 and apd80 was not significantly
altered by addition of riluzole at concentrations of 3, 10 and
30 mm to the perfusate (figure 6). in pigs, riluzole produced
no change in ecg intervals 50 min after a dose of 8 mg·kg-1 ip
(table 4, n = 6 for riluzole group, n = 10 for control)

discussion
there is now a considerable body of evidence to show that the
key event in the sequence triggered by hypoxia or ischaemia
in the heart is a rise in [na+]i (shryock and belardinelli, 2008).
the mechanisms underlying this rise in [na+]i are not clear. as
noted above, one well described mechanism, the inhibition of
british journal of pharmacology (2010) 160 1072–1082

nhe1 during ischaemia and the subsequent large h+ extrusion and na+ influx during reperfusion, falls short of fully
explaining the rise in na+ and the ensuing cellular damage
from ischaemia and reperfusion. studies have shown that the
rise in [na+]i during ischaemia can be attenuated by blockers
of nhe1, such as cariporide: (ten hove et al., 2005). however,
in animal models, block of nhe does not completely prevent
the rise in na+ or provide complete protection from damage,
a result reflected in the disappointing results with nhe1
blockers in clinical trials (theroux et al., 2000; zeymer et al.,
2001). animal experiments have also shown that reduction in
[na+]i and protection from reperfusion damage can equally
and synergistically be provided by blocking voltagedependent sodium channels (eigel and hadley, 1999; ten
hove et al., 2007).
as the transient, voltage-dependent, sodium channels
rapidly inactivate, they cannot be the source of a sustained na+
influx during ischaemia or reperfusion. rather, the influx
appears to occur through a population of na+ channels that do
not inactivate, and which give rise to a ‘persistent’ sodium
current, inap (saint et al., 1992; baetz et al., 2003). this current
has been shown to be greatly enhanced by hypoxia (ju et al.,
1996b; hammarstrom and gage, 2002) and it would seem that
block of this current should provide protection against
ischaemia/reperfusion damage. indeed, over 10 years ago, le
grand et al. showed that low concentrations of ttx (320 nm,
a concentration that produces a relatively selective block of the
inap over inat) can alleviate the contractile dysfunction
caused by ischaemia in guinea pig isolated heart (le grand
et al., 1995). more recently, the potential for agents that block
inap as a cardioprotective agents has also been discussed by
others (belardinelli et al., 2006; saint, 2008). a working
hypothesis that has been proposed, on the basis of the effects
of ttx, amiloride and zoniporide, is that the na+ influx during
ischaemia is predominantly caused by flux through inap, while
the large rise in [na+]i upon reperfusion is caused by the activity
of nhe1. hence, block of inap should present a useful strategy
to protect against ischaemic damage, and at least one agent,
 xxxd3083xxx , is in late development with this proposed mechanism of action (belardinelli et al., 2006), although  xxxd3083xxx 
also has other possible mechanisms of action.
this lack of selective blockers has presented difficulties in
exploiting block of inap as a strategy. some agents do exhibit
some selectivity, such as lidocaine and ttx (ju et al., 1992;
ju et al., 1994) and  xxxd3083xxx  (antzelevitch et al., 2004),
however, the difference in potency for block of inap and inat
with these agents is small and the block of inat is potentially
lethal. although newer agents are being developed to have an
increased selectivity for block of inap (vacher et al., 2009; vie
et al., 2009), it is difficult to develop these agents because the
molecular mechanisms producing inap are not well understood. the cardiac isoform of (transient) voltage-gated sodium
channels ( xxxg2028xxx ) is quite different from the neuronal
( xxxg2020xxx ,  xxxg2022xxx ,  xxxg2024xxx ,  xxxg2029xxx ,  xxxg2030xxx ,  xxxg2018xxx  and
 xxxg2019xxx ) and skeletal muscle ( xxxg2026xxx ) isoforms, and the
cardiac isoform displays a quite different pharmacological
profile from the others (channel nomenclature follows alexander et al., 2009). in parallel with this, it is not known
whether inap in other tissues has the same pharmacology as
that seen in the heart.

figure 6 effect of riluzole on monophasic action potentials (maps)
in rat normoxic heart. change in the duration of epicardial maps
induced in normoxic isolated hearts (n = 6) by riluzole at 3, 10 and
30 mm, compared with control (zero riluzole). bars show change (as
a percentage of control value) in apd20, apd50 and apd80. error bars
show standard error of the mean. none of the changes were significant. the inset shows superimposed examples of maps from one
heart recorded before (arrowed ‘c’) and during perfusion with 30 mm
riluzole (arrowed ‘r’).

there is data to show that, in the heart, inap has a different
pharmacological profile from inat (ju et al., 1992; ju et al.,
1996a), a difference that argues for it being caused by a distinct, as yet unknown, sodium channel isoform. however, a
different conclusion arises from the observation that expression of human cardiac a-subunit of the na+ channel ( xxxg2028xxx ) in
hek293 cells results in a sodium current having both transient and persistent components, the persistent component
being enhanced by hypoxia (hammarstrom and gage, 2002).
this suggests that inap arises from a subset of the (homogeneous) channel population entering a different gating state,
with the enhancement of inap by hypoxia being caused by
modulation of channel gating. in this case, the apparent
different pharmacology of the channel must arise from the
kinetics of block of the channel in different gating states. the
difficulty in finding a blocker of cardiac inap is therefore
compounded not only by finding a blocker which is selective
for inap over inat, but one which is also selective for the
cardiac isoform.
we report here that riluzole, which has been suggested to
block neuronal inap, does indeed block inap in cardiac myocytes. moreover, riluzole blocks inap in a concentrationbritish journal of pharmacology (2010) 160 1072–1082

dependent manner between 0.01 and 10 mm, these
concentrations being similar to those used for neuronal treatment and already having been shown to not be harmful in
humans (le liboux et al., 1999). we also show that riluzole
has minimal effect on inat even  xxxd1891xxx -fold higher concentrations than those required to block inap.
it has been suggested that small, non-inactivating currents
can arise because of the overlap of the inactivation and activation voltage dependence- giving rise to ‘window currents’
at certain membrane potentials. we showed here that riluzole shifts the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation of inat in ways that reduce the overlap of the
inactivation and activation curves of inat, which would
tend to reduce a window current, consistent with a block of
inap. however, this occurred only at higher concentrationsno shift was seen at 3 mm, which produces a substantial
block of inap. furthermore, it has been shown previously
that inap is not a window current (saint et al., 1992). in our
experiments reported here, we elicited inap by a voltage
step to -20 mv, well beyond the region where overlap of
inactivation and activation curves would be expected to
produce a window current.
in the isolated heart, 3 and 10 mm riluzole offered substantial cardioprotection by significantly reducing the degree of
contracture during ischaemia as well as the degree of contracture and the time to the return of pulse pressure upon reperfusion. riluzole also reduced the diastolic pressure and
increased the systolic pressure post reperfusion thus significantly and beneficially improving myocardial recovery. in
addition, riluzole increased the rate of ventricular relaxation
and the rate of ventricular contractility thus further enhancing myocardial recovery. of note was the observation that
riluzole produced positive intropic and lusitropic effects when
added to the heart before ischaemia; the systolic pressures,
+dlvp/dt and –dlvp/dt, were significantly increased for all
concentrations (figure 1b – pre-ischaemia values). the inotropic effect was also apparent in the isolated cell experiments
(figure 2), where an increase in contractility appeared to
occur without an obvious increase in the calcium transient. as
we have shown that riluzole did not affect the map, this
suggests that perhaps it can act to sensitize the contractile
proteins to calcium. however, the lack of correlation between
this effect and the protective effect (e.g. at 1 mm there is an
obvious inotropic effect, but no significant protection) indicates that it is not responsible for the protective effect. we
have not investigated this inotropic and lusitropic effect
further in this study.
we found that riluzole blocked the hypoxic component of
inap without affecting inat, prevented [ca2+]i accumulation
british journal of pharmacology (2010) 160 1072–1082

and the cessation of cell shortening in response to hypoxia
and re-oxygenation, and provided substantial cardioprotection from ischaemia and ischaemia-reperfusion, all with a
similar ic50 of around 3 mm. we therefore propose that riluzole may be an effective anti-ischaemic and cardioprotective
medication for use in myocardial hypoxia, ischaemia and
ischaemia-reperfusion settings.

limitations of study
because of the difficulty in ensuring good ph control in the
isolated cell experiments, because of the technical difficulty in
bubbling the solutions while on the microscope stage and the
movement artefacts so produced, experiments in the isolated
cells were carried out in hepes-buffered solutions. hence, the
bicarbonate-na+ co-transporter would not be active in these
cells, and this would be expected to reduce the sodium influx
into the cells during the period of intracellular acidosis. this
would tend to reduce the severity of ischaemic damage in
these cells. these experiments also used hypoxia, rather than
ischaemia, the latter not being appropriate to isolated cell
measurements. hence, the composition of the ‘extracellular’
(bath) solution will not change materially during the experiment, whereas in isolated heart during stop flow, leakage of
ions and metabolites from the cells can lead to changes in
extracellular composition. nevertheless, the isolated cells
showed large fluctuations in [ca2+]i and a contractile deficit in
hypoxia and ischaemia, and riluzole was effective in reducing
both, consistent with results from the isolated hearts.

potential therapeutic applications
given that riluzole shows some degree of selectivity for block
of inap over inat, it may have promise as an anti-ischaemic
agent in clinical applications. obvious applications would be
post-myocardial infarction, at reperfusion, or as a protective
agent in cardioplegia situations. as riluzole is already
approved for use in humans, one can surmise that toxicity
(at least acute toxicity) at the normal clinical dose of
100 mg·day-1 will not present a problem. cardiovascular side
effects are very rare at the clinically approved doses (groeneveld et al., 2003) and the fact that we see no change in the
map in rat hearts and no change in ecg intervals in pigs
reinforces this lack of cardiac adverse effects. however, it
should be noted that riluzole blocks inap in many types of
neurones, and obviously crosses the blood brain barrier, so it
is possible that neuronal effects may limit the dose if it is used

in a cardiac setting. rilutek prescribing information also
notes: ‘due to its blockade of glutamatergic neurotransmission, riluzole also exhibits myorelaxant and sedative properties in animal models at doses of 30 mg·kg-1 (about 20 times
the recommended human daily dose) and anticonvulsant
properties at a dose of 2.5 mg·kg-1 (about 2 times the recommended human daily dose)’. hence it seems possible that
riluzole may present a novel opportunity as a cardioprotective
agent. in addition, the data suggests that development of
more specific blockers of inap should be pursued with a view
to improving this potential novel class of therapeutic agents.
