abstract
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) treated with anti- xxxg2296xxx  (tnf) strategies have an increased susceptibility
to infections, especially those caused by intracellular pathogens. in this study we assessed the cytokine production capacity in
patients with ra and we further investigated whether anti-tnf therapy modulates the production of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines
involved in the resistance against infections. whole blood cultures from 10 ra patients and 10 healthy controls were stimulated with
heat-killed candida albicans, salmonella typhimurium, staphyloccocus aureus, aspergillus fumigatus or mycobacterium tuberculosis
and production of interleukin (il)-1b, il-6, il-10, interferon (ifn)-g and  xxxg2296xxx  was measured. before anti-tnf therapy, whole
blood cultures from ra patients released signiﬁcantly less ifn-g than healthy controls after stimulation with all tested
microorganisms. short-term anti-tnf therapy did not have an inhibitory eﬀect on the release of the cytokines tested. we conclude
that cells of patients with ra have a strongly reduced production capacity of ifn-g after bacterial challenge. although short-term
therapy with anti-tnf agents did not further decrease the release of other proinﬂammatory cytokines, the combination of defective
ifn-g production in basal conditions and tnf neutralization during anti-tnf therapy is likely to be responsible for the higher
susceptibility to infections in patients with ra.

esis of rheumatoid arthritis (ra) [1].  xxxg2296xxx  blockade
with monoclonal antibodies and receptor fusion proteins has proved beneﬁcial in ra [2e5]. despite the
clinical, radiological and functional beneﬁts of tnf
inhibitors, safety issues of increased susceptibility to
infections [6e8], especially due to mycobacterium
tuberculosis but also to other intracellular and opportunistic pathogens including pneumocystis carinii, histoplasma capsulatum, aspergillus fumigatus, listeria
monocytogenes, and salmonella typhimurium [6,8e11],
are a serious concern.
cellular recognition of diﬀerent microorganisms
leads to release of proinﬂammatory cytokines, such as
tnf, interleukin (il)-1b, il-18 and interferon (ifn)-g,

c. popa et al. / cytokine 30 (2005) 72e77

which activate host defense [12]. in vitro stimulation
of monocytes and macrophages with mycobacteria
or mycobacterial products induces the production of
 xxxg2296xxx , which in turn increases phagocytosis, potentiates mycobacterial killing and is central in granuloma
formation [13,14]. in in vivo models, mice treated with
anti-tnf have delayed and insuﬃcient granuloma
formation and an increased susceptibility for mycobacterial infection.
tnf also induces the production of cytokines such as
il-1b, il-6 and chemokines and increases the expression of adhesion molecules, all of which are involved in
cell recruitment and in the immune response towards
diﬀerent microorganisms [12]. besides tnf, ifn-g
plays a key role in the killing of microorganisms by
macrophages, inducing the production of reactive
oxygen (roi) and nitrogen (rni) intermediates
[16]. ifn-g knockout mice are highly susceptible to
m. tuberculosis [17] and individuals lacking receptors for
ifn-g suﬀer from recurrent and sometimes lethal
mycobacterial infections [18].
 xxxg2296xxx  neutralization in ra results in decreased
circulating levels of il-6, il-8, soluble adhesion
molecules and reduces leukocyte traﬃc into inﬂamed
joints, but little is known about its eﬀect on cytokine
production proﬁle; after bacterial stimulation the latter
may have consequences for the development of infections. recently, we have reported that whole blood
cultures from patients with ra treated with anti-tnf
agents that developed infections exhibit a signiﬁcantly
lower ifn-g production than controls after stimulation
with intracellular organisms [11]. we suggested that this
may contribute to the increased susceptibility of these
patients to infections with intracellular organisms.
in the present study our aim is to extend these
observations in a group of non-treated ra patients and
to assess the eﬀect of anti-tnf therapy on cytokine
production capacity.

2. results
2.1. cytokine production capacity in ra patients
at baseline
stimulation of whole blood cultures with each of the
microbial stimuli resulted in profound inhibition of
ifn-g production in patients with ra as compared to
healthy controls: 0.13 g 0.28 ng/ml vs. 2.8g4.5 ng/ml
when stimulated with c. albicans (p ! 0:002); 0.42g0.12
ng/ml vs. 4.0 g 4.2 ng/ml with s. aureus (p!0:002);
0.48g1.1 ng/ml vs. 5.8g3.8 ng/ml with s. typhimurium (p!0:0004); 0.010g0.011 ng/ml vs. 0.09g0.11
ng/ml with a. fumigatus (p ! 0:045); 0.017g0.02 ng/ml
vs. 0.19g0.36 ng/ml with m. tuberculosis (p ! 0:1). in
contrast, production of il-1b,  xxxg2296xxx  and il-6 as well as

73

il-10 did not diﬀer between ra and healthy controls,
regardless of the stimulus used (fig. 1).
2.2. the eﬀect of anti-tnf treatment
on cytokine production
cytokines were measured in whole blood cultures
where the presence of the therapeutic anti-tnf antibodies prevented us to reliable measure endogenous
tnf production. therefore, during therapy, the capacity to produce  xxxg2296xxx  under microbial stimulation could
not be assessed, although its concentrations measured in
our samples were lower than prior the treatment (not
shown). the production capacity of il-10 after 2 weeks
of anti-tnf therapy was slightly decreased when the
blood was stimulated with c. albicans and s. typhimurium, but returned to basal levels at week 14 (fig. 2).
anti-tnf therapy did not inﬂuence the capacity of
whole-blood from ra patients to release ifn-g (fig. 2),
il-6 and il-1b (not shown).

3. discussion
in the present study, we show that ra patients at
baseline have a signiﬁcantly decreased production of
ifn-g compared to healthy controls, while the production of  xxxg2296xxx , il-6, il-1b and il-10 did not diﬀer
between the two groups. short-term treatment of ra
patients with anti-tnf antibodies scarcely inﬂuenced
ifn-g, il-6, il-1b and il-10 production capacity of
these patients.
stimulation of whole-blood cultures with grampositive s. aureus, c. albicans and intracellular microorganisms (m. tuberculosis and a. fumigatus) resulted in
an impaired ifn-g production in ra patients when
compared to healthy controls. ifn-g is produced
mainly in t cells and nk cells and its production is
strongly modulated by other cytokines such as il-12,
il-18. the decreased ifn-g production might be due to
a decreased in number of th1 cells in the peripheral
blood of ra patients [19e23]. due to the central role of
ifn-g for the activation of cellular immunity, we
speculate that a decreased ifn-g production in ra
patients contributes to an increased susceptibility of
these patients to infections. the types of infection of
patients taking anti-tnf drugs (tuberculosis, salmonellosis, candidosis) are compatible with decreased cell
immunity and decreased ifn-g [16]. we have reported
previously that ra patients treated with anti-tnf have
a lower ifn-g production, compared with ra patients
that were not treated with anti-tnf agents [11]. in the
present study, ra patients had a much lower ifn-g
production before start of anti-tnf, compared to nontreated patients in the initial report. this discrepancy
might be explained by the diﬀerent duration of disease,

disease activity and response to therapy between the two
groups: recently diagnosed, mild ra responding to
standard therapy in one group [11], and long-lasting
ra, relatively severe disease where usual disease
modifying drugs failed to control the disease, in the
anti-tnf treated group of the present study.
from the present study, it is clear that the production
of ifn-g in ra is already disturbed at baseline and not
inﬂuenced by short-term therapy with anti-tnf agents.
this was also true for cytokines such as il-1b and il-6.
 xxxg2296xxx  is a proinﬂammatory cytokine that plays
a critical role in the regulation of the inﬂammatory
processes during infections.  xxxg2296xxx  inhibition has led to
a decreased ability to control infections, which was

demonstrated both in animal models and in human
studies [14,15,25]. we could not assess  xxxg2296xxx  production capacity due to the interference of the therapeutic anti-tnf antibodies in our whole blood cultures
with the immunoassay.
in addition, il-10 production from stimulated whole
blood cultures after short-term therapy with inﬂiximab
for 14 weeks was scarcely inﬂuenced when compared
with the one prior to therapy. recently, schuerwegh
et al. have assessed  xxxg2296xxx , il-1b and il-6 production
of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) immediately after the ﬁrst dose of inﬂiximab and 6 months
after starting the therapy, and found the production of
these cytokines signiﬁcantly decreased at both time

points after stimulation with escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (lps) [24]. lps from gram-negative bacteria
is known to trigger the cytokine production through
binding toll-like receptor-4 ( xxxg2290xxx ). in a previous
study, we showed that anti-tnf antibodies have
signiﬁcantly reduced the percentage of  xxxg2290xxx  positive
dendritic cells in ra patients [11] and this might explain
the lower levels of  xxxg2296xxx , il-1b and il-6 seen after
pbmcs stimulation with lps. heat-killed microorganism, however, are much more complex structures than
lps and they may activate cells through interactions
with diﬀerent receptors, both tlrs and non-tlrs.
from this perspective, evaluating cytokine production
pattern after stimulation with heat-killed microorganisms known to be involved in the infectious complica-

tions of ra patients treated with anti-tnf agents, is
much more relevant clinically. for the same reason, to
mimic as close as possible the in vivo situation, we have
chosen to use a whole-blood stimulation method for the
assessment of cytokine production, instead of puriﬁed
cell population. the advantage of a whole-blood assay is
that it contains all relevant cell-populations from blood
that come in contact with the invading pathogen and it
has all the circulating plasma components.

4. conclusions
we suggest that the combination of a pre-existing
severely depressed ifn-g production together with

76

c. popa et al. / cytokine 30 (2005) 72e77

neutralization of  xxxg2296xxx  induced by anti-tnf treatment is very likely to play a major role for the impaired
host defense against intracellular and fungal microorganisms observed in ra patients undergoing this kind
of therapy. further investigations need to be done on
a large number of patients and for longer periods in
order to assess the eﬀects of anti-tnf therapy on the
long-term.

5. materials and methods
5.1. patients and controls
venous blood was collected from 10 healthy volunteers and 10 ra patients, matched for gender and age,
at baseline and after 2, 6 and 14 weeks after initiation of
anti-tnf therapy with the anti-tnf antibody inﬂiximab (schering-plough). informed consent was obtained
from all study subjects.
5.2. whole blood cytokine production
venous blood was collected from the cubital vein in
4-ml lithium heparin tubes. whole blood was diluted 1:5
with rpmi 1640 in 24-well plates and stimulated with
1!107 microorganisms/ml, as previously described by
our group [26]. the pathogens studied consisted of heatkilled candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium, mycobacterium tuberculosis and
aspergillus fumigatus. incubation with rpmi was used
as negative control. after incubation for 24 or 48 h at
37  c, supernatants were obtained by centrifugation
and stored at ÿ80  c until assay. in pilot experiments,
 xxxg2296xxx  production from stimulated pbmcs reached the
maximum level after approximately 8 h and the highest
il-6 production was seen in the ﬁrst 24 h after
stimulation, while il-10 and ifn-g reached the
maximum concentration in the supernatants later, in
approximately 48 h. subsequently we have chosen 24 h
and 48 h to measure the production of the abovementioned cytokines. concentrations of  xxxg2296xxx , il-6
(after 24 h of stimulation) and ifn-g, il-10 (after 48 h
of stimulation) were measured using commercial elisa
kits (pelikine, clb amsterdam, the netherlands),
while il-1b was measured using speciﬁc radioimmunoassay.
5.3. statistical analysis
diﬀerences between groups were assessed using
mannewhitney u-test. diﬀerences within groups were
assessed using paired wilcoxon test. unless otherwise
stated, results are expressed as mean g standard deviation (sd).
