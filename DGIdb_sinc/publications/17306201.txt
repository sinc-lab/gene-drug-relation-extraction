association with litter size of new polymorphisms on  xxxg730xxx  and  xxxg731xxx  genes in a chinese-european pig line.  the objective of this study was to search for polymorphisms in the coding region of the estrogen receptors 1 and 2 ( xxxg730xxx  and  xxxg731xxx ) and to analyze the effects of these variants and the well known intronic  xxxg730xxx  pvuii polymorphism on litter size in a chinese-european pig line. we identified five silent single nucleotide polymorphisms (snp) in the  xxxg730xxx  cdna: c.669t > c (exon 3), c.1227c > t (exon 5), c.1452c > t (exon 7), c.1665t > c and c.1755a > g (exon 8). one pair of these snp (c.1665t > c and c.1755a > g) co-segregated in the analyzed line, and the snp c.669t > c showed the same segregation pattern as the pvuii polymorphism. these polymorphisms were tested in this study, although the c.1452c > t snp within exon 7 was not analyzed due to its low informativeness. in the  xxxg731xxx  cdna, one missense snp was found within exon 5, which caused an amino acid substitution in the coded protein: "c.949g > a (p.val317met)" and was tested on sow litter size. information on 1622 litter records from 408 genotyped sows was analyzed to determine whether these snp influenced the total number of piglets born (tnb) or the number of born alive (nba). the polymorphisms  xxxg730xxx : [ pvuii; c.669t > c] ,  xxxg730xxx : [ c.1665t > c; c.1755a > g] and  xxxg731xxx : c.949g > a showed no statistically significant association with litter size. however, the  xxxg730xxx : c.1227t allele was significantly associated with tnb. the additive substitution effect was estimated to be 0.40 piglets born per litter (p < 0.03), and no dominance effects were observed. this snp could be useful in assisted selection for litter size in some pig lines, as a new genetic marker in linkage disequilibrium with the causative mutation.
