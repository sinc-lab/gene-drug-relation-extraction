abstract

the above-mentioned cytokines, through an increase of amniocyte phospholipase (pl)a2 and  xxxg1884xxx  (cox
2) expression [7, 8], act as potent physiological regulators
of pg biosynthesis in normal labor at term, but they are
also involved in pathological conditions such as preterm
labor, whether dependent on or independent of intrauterine
infections.
in addition to cytokines, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fmlp) must be considered a factor involved
either directly or indirectly in pg production by fetal membranes. indeed, in a previous report we provided the first
evidence for the presence of specific binding sites for 3hfmlp in crude plasma membranes obtained from term human amnion, as well as for a direct action of the peptide
on amniotic pge 2 release [9]. furthermore, it has been reported that the peptide-induced activation of granulocytes
and mononuclear cells leads to the release of cytokines that
stimulate pge 2 production by amniocytes [10].
in addition to amniocytes, wish cells that are human
amnion-derived cells have also been shown to release pgs
and cytokines in response to different stimuli [11–14]. this
cell line hence represents an ideal candidate for an in vitro
study of the events triggering the onset of labor.
in this study we investigated the presence of fmlp binding sites, their possible effect on pge 2 release, and the
transduction pathway activated by the peptide in wish
cells.

the presence of binding sites for formyl-methionyl-leucylphenylalanine (fmlp), its effect on  xxxd1903xxx  (pge) release, and the signal transduction pathway activated by the peptide were investigated in human amnion-derived wish cells.
our results demonstrate that specific binding sites for fmlp are
present on wish cells and that the peptide induces a significant
increase of prostaglandin (pg) xxxd2037xxx  release. the kinetic properties
of binding are similar to those previously found in amnion tissue
prior to the onset of labor, i.e., only one population of binding
sites with low affinity for the peptide is present. binding of 3hfmlp in wish cells is inhibited by n-t-butoxycarbonyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, an fmlp receptor antagonist, with an
ic50 value very close to that shown by nonlaboring amnion. the
fmlp-induced pge 2 output is inhibited by indomethacin, quinacrine, and u-73122, inhibitors of cyclooxygenase,  xxxg1759xxx , and phospholipase c, respectively. as regards the transduction pathway activated by fmlp, we demonstrate that phospholipase c activation, followed by an increase of intracellular
calcium concentration ([ca21]i), is involved in response to the
peptide. our results add further evidence to the role of proinflammatory agents in the determination of labor. furthermore,
because wish cells appear to behave like nonlaboring amnion
tissue, they represent the ideal candidate for in vitro investigation of the events triggering the mechanism of delivery.

introduction
materials and methods

it is well known that gestational tissues increase prostaglandin production in both term and preterm labor, as suggested by their elevated concentrations in the amniotic fluid
and maternal plasma [1, 2]. these prostanoids, in particular
prostaglandin (pg) xxxd2037xxx  and  xxxd1902xxx , induce uterine contractions by means of a paracrine mechanism [3]. prostaglandin
 xxxd2037xxx  is the main prostanoid produced by gestational tissues,
and its biosynthesis is affected by several agents, among
which oxytocin, growth factors, and cytokines such as several interleukins (ils) and  xxxg2296xxx -a ( xxxg2296xxx ),
as well as other factors [4–6]. it has been demonstrated that

cell culture and treatments

amnion-derived wish cells were obtained from the
american type culture collection (atcc ccl-25) and
maintained in the laboratory. cells were grown at 378c in
an atmosphere of 5% co2 and 95% air, in a mixture of
ham’s f12 and dulbecco modified eagle medium (f12/
dmem) (1:1 vol/vol) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (fbs), 30 mg/ml gentamicin, and 0.25 mg/ml  xxxd164xxx  [11].
to evaluate the effects of fmlp alone or in combination
with other agents on pge 2 production, wish cells were
seeded in 24-well plates at 2 3 105 cells/well in f12/
dmem 1 10% fbs and grown to confluence (2–3 days);
the medium was then replaced with fresh serum-free medium for 24 h. this medium was removed and again replaced with fresh serum-free medium, containing increasing
concentrations of fmlp (10 nm to 10 mm) or 50 mm n-tbutoxycarbonyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (bocmlp), an fmlp receptor antagonist. indomethacin, quinacrine, and u-73122, inhibitors of cox, pla2, and phospholipase c, respectively, were added 30 min before the

addition of fmlp. after incubation of samples for the indicated time, the media were collected and stored at 2808c
until pge 2 ria was performed. the fmlp binding receptor assays to whole wish cells were carried out. cells were
harvested (107 cells/flask) by trypsinization, suspended in
pbs for neutralization, and pelleted by centrifugation at
500 3 g for 5 min.
binding assay

radioreceptor assay for fmlp binding was performed as
described previously [9]. briefly, 106 cells were incubated
in dulbecco medium, ph 7.4, in the presence of 5 nm
[3h]fmlp alone to determine the specific binding of fmlp
or in combination with 10 nm to 50 mm unlabeled fmlp
for scatchard analysis. nonspecific binding was determined
by adding 1024 m unlabeled fmlp in both the above tests.
to determine the ligand specificity of the receptor, competitive binding assays were performed with boc-mlp
(1028 to 1024 m).
prostaglandin  xxxd2037xxx  ria

the amount of e series pgs was assayed in the collected
media by an ria procedure, as previously described [9]. a
specific antiserum for  xxxd124xxx  and pge 2 (cross reactions
100% and 165%, respectively) was used. labeled
[3h]pge 2 (3 nci) was added to each tube. assay sensitivity
was 15 pg/tube, and the intra- or interassay coefficients of
variation were ,10%. data were expressed as nanograms
of pge 2 produced/106 cells.
measurements of ca21 with fluorescent indicators
and confocal imaging in wish cells

wish cells, grown to 40–60% confluence (2 days after
plating) at 378c in an atmosphere of 5% co2 and 95% air
on glass coverslips 12 mm in diameter, were washed three
times with 1 ml of medium containing: 125 mm nacl, 5
mm kcl, 1.5 mm cacl2, 1 mm mgcl2, and 10 mm glucose, buffered to ph 7.4 with 25 mm hepes.
cells were loaded at 378c for 30 min with the ca21sensitive fluorescent dye fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester (fluo3/am) that was diluted in the medium to a final concentration of 5 mm from stock solutions (10 mm) frozen in
dimethylsulfoxide.
after being loaded, the glass coverslip was placed in a
500-ml bath chamber, and loaded cells were left to hydrolyze for 15 min to ensure the complete hydrolysis of acetoxymethyl ester groups; the chamber was then placed on
an inverted microscope. samples were imaged by an
lsm410 inverted confocal microscope (zeiss, oberckochen, germany) coupled with a 25-mw multiline argon ion.
laser light was attenuated to 3% of transmission with a
neutral density filter to limit bleaching of fluo-3 fluorescence, and to avoid cell damage. settings for all experiments were rigorously maintained as described previously
[15]. intracellular calcium concentration ([ca21]i) was measured as previously described [11]. quantitative fluorescence mean values in different cells, expressed as arbitrary
units, were calculated from a sequence of images obtained
throughout the experiment and were plotted as different diagrams.
data expression and analysis

binding data were analyzed using radlig version 4 by
dr. g.a. mcpherson (biosoft, cambridge, uk). this pro-

gram utilized a nonlinear least-squares curve-fitting algorithm and assumed the simultaneous contribution of one or
more independent binding sites. data are expressed as mean
6 sem. statistical significance was assessed by one-way
anova, followed by dunnett’s t-test; p , 0.05 was considered significant.
chemicals

[5,6(n)-3h]pge 2 (181 ci/mmol) and [3h]fmlp (71.5 ci/
mmol) were purchased from amersham pharmacia biothec
srl (milan, italy) and nen life sciences products, inc.
(milan, italy), respectively. whatman gf/b glass fiber filters were from whatman int. (maidstone, kent, england).
the fmlp, boc-mlp, quinacrine, pge 2, anti-pge-bsa serum, and indomethacin were from the sigma chemical co.
(st. louis, mo). the u-73122 was from biomol research
lab, inc. (plymouth meeting, pa). all tissue culture media
and sera were purchased from gibco brl (paisley, scotland). the fluo-3/am was obtained from molecular probes
(eugene, or). all other chemicals were the highest reagent
grades commercially available.
results

binding of 3h-fmlp

the specific binding of 3h-fmlp to amnion-derived
wish cells was rapid, reaching a maximum at 15 min; this
value was stable until at least 120 min at 378c. binding
was saturable, and nonspecific binding, evaluated in the
presence of 1024 m unlabeled fmlp, never exceeded 10%
of total binding. a scatchard analysis was performed,
where nonlinear iterative curve-fitting elaboration of binding data revealed the existence of a single class of binding
sites. the mean values of the dissociation constant (kd ) and
the maximal density of binding sites (bmax) were 6.3 6 0.6
mm and 23 100 6 2080 sites/cell, respectively.
under the same experimental conditions, the fmlp receptor antagonist boc-mlp was then utilized in competition binding experiments, where increasing concentrations
of the peptide (1028 to 1024 m) progressively inhibited
[3h]-fmlp binding to wish cells. the calculated ic50 was
56.4 6 5.1 mm.
prostaglandin  xxxd2037xxx  release from wish cells

in a first series of experiments, we tested the ability of
fmlp to affect pge 2 release from wish cells. in figure
1, the time-courses of basal and fmlp-induced pge 2 output are illustrated. both basal and fmlp-stimulated release
progressively increased with time, reaching a plateau after
30 min of incubation. the addition of 1026 m fmlp increased pge 2 output at each time tested; this effect became
statistically significant at 15 min of incubation and reached
maximal stimulation at 30 min. in the subsequent experiments, the reactions were therefore carried out for 30 min.
concentrations of fmlp, ranging from 1028 to 1025 m,
dose-dependently increased pge 2 production; the effect became statistically significant (p , 0.05) at 1027 m and
reached the maximum (167%, with respect to basal value)
at 1026 m. no further increase in pge 2 output was observed in the presence of higher peptide concentrations
(fig. 2).
figure 3 reports the effect of 5 3 1025 m boc-mlp (a
concentration close to ic50, the value obtained from the
binding studies) on both basal and fmlp-stimulated pge 2
output. as shown, the receptor antagonist was ineffective

in inhibiting basal pge 2 release but very efficaciously prevented activation by fmlp.
to provide evidence that fmlp-induced pge 2 synthesis
is a cox-driven event, we preincubated wish cells with
various concentrations (1029 to 5 3 1026 m) of indomethacin for 30 min. cells were then incubated with or without
1026 m fmlp. as shown in figure 4, indomethacin dosedependently reduced both basal and fmlp-evoked pge 2
output, the effect becoming statistically significant (p ,
0.05) at 1027 m and reaching the maximum (about 285%
with respect to values obtained in the absence of indomethacin) at 1026 m; inhibition remained almost unchanged at higher doses of the cox inhibitor.
we then tested the effect of increasing concentrations
(1028 to 1025 m) of quinacrine, a pla2 inhibitor [16], added 30 min before fmlp. the drug was ineffective in inhibiting basal pge 2 release but dose-dependently reduced
fmlp-evoked pge 2 output; the effect was statistically significant (p , 0.05) at 5 3 1027 m, reaching the maximum
(240% of the value obtained in the absence of the inhibitor) at 1025 m (fig. 5).

were preincubated for 30 min with various concentrations
(1028 to 1025 m) of u-73122, a plc inhibitor [17], and
then incubated with or without 1026 m fmlp. as shown in
figure 6, basal pge 2 release was unaffected by all the tested concentrations of the drug, but fmlp-induced pge 2 production was dose-dependently inhibited; the inhibitory effect of u-73122 became statistically significant at 5 3 1027
m (p , 0.05) and maximum at 1025 m (240%).
an fmlp-induced [ca21]i transient in single wish cells

we assessed the intracellular level of ca21 indicator dyes
in confocal laser scanning microscopy-imaged wish cells
loaded with fluo-3/am. scanned images were obtained
from a single optical slice passing through the plane of the
cell nucleus with a temporal resolution of 0.5 sec and were
analyzed as a function of time.
treatment with 1026 m fmlp, the most effective dose
for inducing pge 2 release, evoked a rise in intracellular
calcium, as evidenced by the increase in fluorescence level
(fig. 7, b and c). we observed that fmlp stimulation re-

sulted in an increased level of intracellular [ca21] that appeared at a defined time. data obtained from computer processing of fluorescence images showed that fmlp-induced
[ca21]i enhancement was 50% above the basal value and
was statistically significant for the majority of cells analyzed (fig. 7, b and c), while a weak response in the fluorescence intensity levels was observed in nearly 39% of the
cells (fig. 7d). the rise of [ca21]i levels started immediately after fmlp exposure, and took 15 sec to reach the
maximum level, indicating that ca21 is involved in a response that requires different steps in order to be activated.
furthermore, the role of plc-mediated [ca21] level oscillations was investigated by employing the specific u73122 plc inhibitor. as can be observed in figure 7e, no
generation of [ca21]i oscillations was produced, thus showing that a plc-mediated response is required for [ca21]i
rise after fmlp treatment.

discussion

the peptide fmlp is prototypic for a series of chemoattractants that are isolated from bacterial culture suspensions [18] and are possibly released by disrupted mammalian cells [19]. granulocytes and mononuclear cells are
considered the conventional target for fmlp actions, but it
has recently been shown that the peptide exerts effects that
do not depend on its chemoattractant action. for instance,
a direct effect of fmlp in the synthesis of acute phase
proteins in hepg2 cells has been reported [20]. furthermore, in coronary arteries the peptide modulates the arterial
tone, producing a transient contraction, without involving
peripheral leukocytes: this response is mediated by the generation of thromboxane a2 and prostaglandin i2 in endothelial and smooth muscle cells [21].
as regards human pregnancy, we have previously demonstrated that the peptide causes an enhancement of am-

wish cells as a target for fmlp actions

niotic pge 2 release, and that the amount of the prostanoid
before labor is significantly lower than that observed after
spontaneous term delivery. moreover, two populations of
specific binding sites, with high and low affinity for fmlp,
are found in laboring amnion, while only the low affinity
type is present in nonlaboring tissue [9].
the results of the present study demonstrate that wish
cells show a specific binding for 3h-fmlp, with kinetic
properties very close to those reported for amniotic membrane obtained prior to the onset of labor. in fact, scatchard
analysis reveals the presence of only one binding site population with low affinity toward the peptide. moreover, the
ic50 value, calculated for the inhibition of formyl peptide
binding by the antagonist boc-mlp, is similar to that observed in amnion obtained prior to the onset of labor. however, fmlp-induced pge 2 synthesis from wish cells is
greater than that observed in nonlaboring amnion, probably
due to differences in the experimental conditions employed.
as for fmlp signal transduction pathways leading to
biosynthesis of the prostanoid, it has been reported that, in
neutrophils, the peptide stimulates pla2, either directly or
through the activation of plc [22]. this mechanism is operative also in our model. in fact: 1) indomethacin, a cox
inhibitor, dose-dependently decreases both spontaneous and
fmlp-stimulated pge 2 release; 2) quinacrine, a pla2 inhibitor, dose-dependently inhibits fmlp-induced pge 2 production, but does not affect basal release; 3) u-73122, an
inhibitor of plc, behaves like quinacrine. these results
seem to exclude a direct influence of fmlp on pla2 and
suggest that the peptide directly activates plc that, in turn,
seems to stimulate pla2. to elucidate further the involvement of plc in this action, we tested the effect of fmlp
on [ca21]i mobilization. the concentration that induces the
maximal pge 2 release, 1026 m fmlp, is able to increase
[ca21]i with a rapid and transient pattern. because u-73122
counteracts ca21 mobilization, it can be concluded that the
cation enhancement induced by plc activation plays a crucial role in fmlp-induced amniotic pge 2 synthesis. however, an involvement of plc also through the activation of
protein kinase c cannot be excluded.
the existence of specific binding sites on human amniocytes implies that endogenous fmlp is presumably produced in both physiological and pathological conditions. as
regards pregnancy, these may be represented by recurrent
rupture of amniochorial or decidual cells following mechanical events, such as distension of the uterus as a consequence of gestational growth, multiple pregnancy, or
polyhydramnios, as well as dynamic processes, such as
braxton-hicks contractions and premature labor. indeed, it
has recently been reported that fetal membranes and wish
cells respond to distension with up-regulation of il-8 [23,
24]; moreover, it has long been known that mitochondrial
n-formylmethionine-containing peptides are released from
degenerating mitochondria at sites of tissue damage [19].
thus, a possible fmlp release following stretching or cell
rupture could represent a mechanism whereby amnion tissue contributes to both term and premature delivery. further pathologic conditions for fmlp release are represented
by infection, which represents a well-known cause of the
majority of premature births. in fact, it has been reported
that fmlp-activated granulocytes and mononuclear cells release cytokines that, in turn, stimulate pge 2 production
from amnion cells [10].
in our opinion, the response of amnion tissue to fmlp
may therefore represent one step in the chain of events
leading to the determination of labor. extensive investiga-

869

tion is needed to establish the peptide’s role in physiological and pathological delivery, to recognize the conditions
able to control its release and to determine the full expression of its amniotic receptor. at present the factors that
could favor the expression of the high-affinity form of
fmlp receptors are unknown. however, possible candidates
are glucocorticoids that are known to enhance the expression of cytokine receptors [25], and whose levels dramatically increase at term [26]. moreover, because it has been
demonstrated that fmlp receptors are up-regulated by prolonged adenosine 39,59-cyclic monophosphate exposure of
neutrophils [27], the numerous agonists whose receptors on
amniocyte membrane are positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase could be involved in this response.
on the basis of the above considerations, it cannot be
excluded that fmlp and fmlp antagonists may represent
new tools in the future management of premature labor, a
major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.
