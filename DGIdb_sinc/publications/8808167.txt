ebastine: a review

with allergies, and protected against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in
patients with asthma.
significant symptom improvement is observed in patients with seasonal or
perennial allergic rhinitis or chronic idiopathic urticaria following administration of ebastine 10 mg/day, or 20 mg/day in severe rhinitis. in clinical trials, the
efficacy of ebastine 10 or 20 mg/day was generally similar to standard dosages
of teifenadine, cetirizine,  xxxd236xxx  and loratadine in patients with seasonal
allergic rhinitis,  xxxd236xxx , teifenadine and ketotifen in patients with chronic
idiopathic urticaria, and ketotifen, teifenadine, chlorpheniramine and  xxxd2572xxx  in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis.
the mostfrequent adverse events reported during ebastine therapy are drowsiness, headache and dry mouth, the incidence being similar to that reported in
placebo recipients. serious adverse cardiac events, observed on rare occasions
with some other histamine hi receptor antagonists, have not been reported with
ebastine, and there has been no evidence of qtc interval prolongation related to
ebastine therapy.
thus, once-daily ebastine offers an effective and well-tolerated alternative to
other second generation antihistamines in current use for the first-line treatment
of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria.

pharmacodynamic
properties

ebastine significantly inhibited histamine-induced wheal and flare compared
with placebo. the extent of inhibition was dose-dependent with single doses of
ebastine between 1 and 30mg. onset of antihistaminic action was evident within
1 to 3 hours of ebastine administration, peaked between 3 and 12 hours, and was
sustained for at least 24 hours. in a comparative study of antihistaminic activity
(inhibition of wheal and flare reactions) in patients with allergic rhinitis ebastine
10mg was similar to terfenadine 60mg, superior to  xxxd2504xxx  10mg and less acti ve
than terfenadine 120mg or cetirizine iomg 3 hours after drug administration. 24
hours after administration the antihistaminic activity of ebastine iomg was similar
to that of  xxxd236xxx  10mg and greater than that of loratadine 10mg and terfenadine 120mg in one study. the activity of ebastine was similar to or greater than
that of cetirizine.
dose-dependent protection against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in
patients with asthma has been demonstrated after administration of ebastine 10
or 30 mg/day for 3 days.
ebastine showed significant antiallergic activity (determined by allergen skin
prick tests and nasal challenge) compared with placebo in adults and children
with allergies to pollen.
ebastine does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier and in murine studies
the concentration of the drug required to inhibit eh] xxxd3050xxx  binding to cerebral hi receptors in vitro was about 5-fold higher than that of terfenadine, and
1500-fold higher than that of chlorpheniramine. no significant effects on the ens
have been observed in healthy volunteers given doses of ebastine 10 to 30mg,
and the drug did not potentiate the depressant effects of alcohol or diazepaminduced impairment of psychomotor performance.
preclinical findings suggest that ebastine may have less potential to induce
cardiovascular adverse events than terfenadine. phase iili clinical studies in
healthy elderly and young adult volunteers found no effect of ebastine on cardiac
parameters including the qtc interval. in addition, no effect on the qtc interval

was observed when plasma concentrations of ebastine were increased as a result
of coadministration of the drug with erythromycin or ketoconazole.
pharmacokinetic
properties

ebastine is a prodrug which is extensively metabolised by first-pass metabolism
to its active carboxylic acid metabolite carebastine. peak plasma concentrations
(c ma0 of carebastine are reached in about 3 to 6 hours in healthy adult volunteers
after administration of single oral doses of ebastine, and steady-state plasma
concentrations are reached by day 3 to 5 of multiple-dose administration. c max
and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve for carebastine increased
in a dose-dependent manner following administration of ebastine 10 to 90mg,
cmax being about 0.1 mg/l after a single lomg dose. the bioavailability of carebastine is increased when ebastine is administered with food. carebastine is
about 98% plasma protein bound and has a large volume of distribution (approximately 90 to 140l). the terminal elimination half-life is between 13 and 16
hours, carebastine being eliminated predominantly in the urine.
the pharrnacokinetic properties of carebastine in healthy elderly volunteers
and children aged 6 to 12 years appear to be similar to those in healthy adults.
hepatic or severe renal impairment did not affect the bioavailability of carebastine but significantly increased the terminal elimination half-life of the drug.
the metabolism of a single dose of ebastine 20mg was significantly slowed
and the elimination half-life significantly prolonged in healthy volunteers when
coadministered with multiple doses of ketoconazole or erythromycin.

clinical efficacy

clinical trials have shown that ebastine 5 to 20mg once daily is effective in the
treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria.
a dosage of 20 mg/day appeared to be more effective than 10 mg/day in the
treatment of severe symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis; however, both dosages
sustained symptom improvement throughout study periods of up to 4 months.
efficacy has been demonstrated in children (aged 2 to 15 years) with seasonal
allergic rhinitis with dosages of ebastine 2.5 to 20 mg/day and in adolescents
(aged 12 to 17 years) with perennial allergic rhinitis (5 or 10 mg/day).
in comparative studies with other antihistamines, ebastine lomg once daily
provided similar symptom relief to that achieved with terfenadine 60mg twice
daily or cetirizine 10 mg/day in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. ebastine
10 mg/day generally showed similar efficacy to that of  xxxd236xxx  10 mg/day,
although the latter was more effective against nasal blockage. the higher dosage
of ebastine 20 mg/day tended to be more effective than either cetirizine or loratadine 10 mg/day.
ebastine 5 mg/day was at least as effective as ketotifen 2 mg/day in improving
symptoms in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis, and unpublished findings
indicate that ebastine 10mg once daily is as effective as terfenadine 60mg twice
daily, chlorpheniramine 6mg twice daily or  xxxd2572xxx  5mg twice daily in the
treatment of this condition.
in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria,  xxxd236xxx  10 mg/day initially
appeared more effective in providing symptom relief than ebastine 5 or 10
mg/day; however, after 4 weeks' treatment, similar efficacy was achieved with
both drugs. ebastine 10 mg/day was at least as effective as terfenadine 120
mg/day, and showed similar efficacy to ketotifen 2 mg/day.
symptom improvement was sustained for 12 months in patients with chronic
idiopathic urticaria treated with ebastine 20 mg/day.

ebastine: a review

263

tolerability

ebastine 5 to 20 mg/day was well tolerated in clinical trials, the incidence of
adverse events being similar to that reported in placebo recipients. the most
common adverse events were drowsiness, headache and dry mouth, which were
mild to moderate in most affected patients. other less common adverse events
included asthenia, gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea/vomiting, increased appetite, diarrhoea, constipation and agitation. in long term studies (up to i year) the
most common adverse events were headache and gastrointestinal disturbance.
comparative studies have found ebastine to be at least as well tolerated as
other histamine hi receptor antagonists including  xxxd236xxx , terfenadine,
cetirizine and loratadine. analysis of pooled ecg data from large clinical trials
did not reveal any adverse cardiovascular effects in over 800 patients with allergic
rhinitis treated with ebastine i to 30 mg/day.
further clinical experience is warranted to confirm the apparent lack of cardiac
events during therapy with ebastine.

dosage and
administration

a single daily dose of oral ebastine i omg is effective for the treatment of adults
with allergic rhinitis or chronic idiopathic urticaria. the recommended dosage in
children is 5mg once daily. a higher dosage of 20 mg/day may provide additional
symptom relief in adults with more severe symptoms, and administration in the
morning provides maximal benefit.
ebastine should be administered with caution in patients with an established
prolongation of the qtc interval, or hepatic or renal insufficiency.

ebastine is a second generation histamine hi
receptor antagonist with structural similarities to
terfenadine. it is a prodrug which is transformed to
its active carboxylic acid metabolite carebastine by
oxidation of one of the methyl groups of the tertbutyl moiety (fig. 1).

1. pharmacodynamic properties
the second generation antihistamines (which
also include terfenadine, loratadine, cetirizine and
 xxxd236xxx ) do not cross the blood-brain barrier to
the same extent as the first generation agents
(chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine). thus, they bind preferentially to peripheral
hi receptors and are relatively nonsedating (see
section 1.3).[1·2] furthermore, second generation
antihistamines have little or no anticholinergic or
antiserotoninergic effects and do not have (ladrenergic blocking effects, unlike first generation
agents.l i ,3]

the antihistaminic activity of ebastine has been
compared with that of other second generation histamine hi receptor antagonists in 30 patients with

cetirizine iomg had a faster onset of antihistaminic action than ebastine 10mg, resulting in
greater inhibition of histamine-induced wheal and
flare 2 hours after administration in 2 randomised
double-blind crossover studies.[9,io]
the order of potency for wheal and flare inhibition in 30 healthy volunteers was: ebastine 10mg

ebastine 10 or 30 mg/day for 3 days protected
against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in
12 patients with asthma.[14] the mean concentration of histamine required to provoke a 20% fall in

significantly increased after administration of
ebastine 10 or 30mg compared with placebo (31.36

also caused some antagonism of methacholineinduced bronchoconstriction in 8 patients; mean
provocation concentrations of  xxxd2586xxx  causing a 20% fall in fev i were 3.35 for ebastine iomg
and 0.76 gil for placebo (p < 0.05).[14]
in a placebo-controlled double-blind conjunctival provocation test, ebastine 10 mg/day for 2
weeks significantly increased the concentration of
histamine required to elicit an allergic response
(conjunctival hyperaemia in more than 50% of the
conjunctival surface and itching) in 20 healthy individuals (p < 0.05 versus placebo).[15]

ebastine: a review

while there are no corresponding data in humans, studies in anaesthetised guinea-pigs found
that ebastine did not inhibit  xxxg1079xxx -mediated
tachycardia at doses which inhibited histamineinduced bronchoconstriction, reflecting the selective hi-antagonistic properties of ebastine.l 16]
1.2 antiallergic activity

the antiallergic activity of ebastine has been
shown in allergen skin prick and nasal challenge
tests in adults and children with allergies, and in in
vitro studies using immunologically challenged
human nasal polyp cells.l8.17-191
the threshold number of grass pollen grains required to induce an allergic reaction (increased nasal symptoms) was significantly increased from
2316 to 43 583 in 12 adult patients during treatment with ebastine 20 mg/day for 1 week, compared with 5150 for placebo (p < 0.05).[17] ebastine
did not block the release of histamine or
leukotrienes into nasal secretions during early or
late phase allergic reactions in this study.
suppression of antigen (olea europae tree pollen)-induced cutaneous inflammation was evident
within 2 hours of ebastine administration in a placebo-controlled comparative study in 180 children
sensitive to olea pollen.l 81 inhibition of the cutaneous reaction (skin prick test) was similar 2 hours
after administration of ebastine or loratadine (dosages not given), whereas ebastine caused greater
inhibition after 8 hours (p < 0.001). inhibition was
still observed after 24 hours in both treatment
groups.
in vitro studies using human nasal polyp cells
(mononuclear cells, mast cells and epithelial cells)
demonstrated that preincubation of these cells with
ebastine or carebastine inhibited the release of
leukotriene ltc 4 and prostaglandin pgd 2 after
challenge with anti-immunoglobulin e (ige).i 18]
1.3 ens effects

nists, is a large molecule which does not readily
distribute into the cns. receptor binding studies
using mouse brain slices found that, whereas ebastine had a high affinity for cerebral hi receptors in
vitro, it did not significantly inhibit [3hjmepyramine binding to mouse brain hi receptors in vivo
at doses causing peripheral hi receptor blockade. the dose of terfenadine required to inhibit
eh] xxxd3050xxx  binding to cerebral hi receptors
by 50% (id50) in vivo was 4.7 mg/kg, whereas a
dose of 25.6 mg/kg of ebastine was required.d 6]
id50 values were about 250 and 1500 times higher,
respectively, than that of the first generation antihistamine agent chlorpheniramine.
no significant effects on the cns were evident
when ebastine was administered to animals at
doses up to 100 mg/kg, which were much higher
than those required for antihistaminic activity.[20.21 1
assessment included effects on spontaneous locomotor activity, exploratory behaviour, learning
ability and potentiation of barbiturate-induced narcosis in rats.
single oral doses of ebastine 10 to 30mg did not
impair psychomotor performance, assessed by
vigilance [electroencephalogram (eeg) changes],
cognitive performance, visual-motor coordination
and subjective estimates of sedation, in healthy
volunteers.l22-261 scores for all parameters were
similar after placebo or ebastine administration,
whereas the hi receptor antagonist clemastine
caused drowsiness, impairment of psychomotor
performance, and had a selective effect on cognitive processes,[23] and triprolidine significantly adversely affected aspects of driving ability compared with placebop7] ebastine 10 to 30 mg/day
did not impair driving performance;[22] however,
doses above the therapeutic range (50 and 90mg)
caused sedation and impairment of psychomotor
performance, as evidenced by significantly increased choice reaction time at 4 and 8 hours,[24]
and impaired performance in the 'critical flickerfusion frequency' test at 5.5 hours compared with
placebo (p < 0.05).[26]

on the depressant activity of alcohol in healthy volunteersps, 281 in addition, ebastine did not affect
diazepam-induced impairment of psychomotor
performance in 12 healthy volunteersp91
1,4 cardiovascular effects

case reports of serious cardiovascular adverse
events occurring in patients during treatment with
the second generation histamine hi receptor antagonists terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx  have led to concern over the safety of this class of drugs. [30-321 prolongation of the ecg qtc interval, which is an
important risk factor for the development of torsade de pointes and other cardiac arrhythmias, has
been observed following overdosages of terfenadine or  xxxd236xxx , or when the metabolism of these
drugs was diminished by chronic liver disease or
by drugs that interfere with cytochrome p450
cyp3a4 liver metabolism (e.g. ketoconazole,
itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin»)331 it
is unclear whether the adverse cardiovascular effects of increased dosages of unmetabolised terfenadine or  xxxd236xxx  may be a class effect, but
they have not been associated to date with other
second generation hi receptor antagonists (including  xxxd2504xxx , cetirizine, azelastine and ebastine)
which interact with hepatic p450-inhibiting drugs
(see section 2.2»)341
the cardiovascular effects of ebastine have been
evaluated in preclinical electrophysiological studies, in phase 1111 studies in healthy volunteers and
in clinical trials in patients with allergic rhinitis.
animal studies indicate that ebastine may have
less effect on the cardiovascular system than terfenadine)3s, 361an in vitro study comparing the effects of ebastine and terfenadine on isolated
guinea-pig ventricular strips found that whereas
terfenadine (10 ilmoul) increased the force of contraction, ebastine had no significant effect over a
similar dose range.[361 ebastine, terfenadine and
 xxxd1704xxx  all significantly depressed the force of
contraction of spontaneously beating guinea-pig
double atrium preparations in vitro at the highest

concentration tested (10 ilmoul), but ebastine had
less depressant effect than either terfenadine or
 xxxd1704xxx  at the lower doses of 0.1 and lllmolll
(both terfenadine and  xxxd1704xxx  caused significant depression compared with controls»)3s1 unpublished preclinical studies have found that ebastine and carebastine were less potent inhibitors than
terfenadine of steady-state currents in human atrial
myocytes in vitro and, unlike terfenadine, did not
inhibit cloned human  xxxg1232xxx  (hkv1.5)
activity. [371
single oral doses of ebastine (10 or 50mg) had
no significant effect on heart rate or blood pressure
in 9 healthy volunteers[ 241 and ebastine 10 mg/day
for 9 days did not have any clinically relevant effects on ecg or 24-hour holter monitoring parameters in 13 healthy elderly (65 to 82 years) and 13
young (18 to 35 years) volunteers in a double-blind
placebo-controlled study)381 qtc values were virtually unchanged in both age groups: the mean qtc
values for ebastine and placebo were 448 (baseline
428 msec) and 438 msec (baseline 436 msec), respectively, in elderly volunteers, and were 442
(baseline 418 msec) and 418 msec (baseline 412
msec) in the young.
coadministration of ebastine with either erythromycin or ketoconazole results in increased accumulation of the parent drug in plasma (section 2.2).
however, no correlation between qtc interval
change and plasma concentration of ebastine or
carebastine was observed in healthy volunteers
when ebastine was coadministered with ketoconazole or erythromycin)39,401 no clinically relevant
cardiac events have been observed in multicentre
double-blind clinical trials in patients with allergic
rhinitis treated with ebastine (see section 4.).
2. pharmacokinetic properties

after oral administration, ebastine undergoes
extensive first-pass metabolism to its active metabolite carebastine; thus, plasma concentrations of
the parent drug are negligible. pharmacokinetic
studies have used high performance liquid chromatography to measure concentrations of carebastine
in body fluids.

ebastine: a review

carebastine has shown approximately linear
pharmacokinetics after administration of single
oral doses of ebastine 10 to 90mg in healthy volunteers. the peak plasma concentration (c max ) of
carebastine and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc) increased in a dosedependent manner, while the time to peak plasma
concentration (t max ), terminal elimination half-life
(ty2~) and mean residence time were independent of
the ebastine dose (table 1).[41-43]
values for tmax were generally between 3 and 6
hours, but appeared to be higher in japanese[43.44]
compared with western[41.4 2.45 .46] volunteers (4.6
to 6.2 versus 2.6 to 5.7 hours) [table ij.
cmax values in young healthy adults following
a single oral dose of 10mg were about 0.1 mg/l

and auc values ranged between 1.75 and 2.94
mg/l. h. during multiple-dose administration of
ebastine, steady-state plasma concentrations of
carebastine were reached by day 3 or 5)37.41.43]
mean peak and trough plasma concentrations were
0.36 to 0.39 mg/l and 0.14 to 0.17 mg/l, respectively, in 6 healthy volunteers who received ebastine 20 mg/day for 7 days.f43] the cmax value at
steady-state was 1.6- to 1.7-fold greater than on
day 1, whereas auco-24 values did not differ significantly from day 1.[43]
the bioavailability of carebastine in healthy
volunteers tended to be increased when ebastine
was administered with food compared with fasting
conditions.f43.4 7j while tmax remained the same,

carebastine is highly bound to plasma proteins
(about 98%)[41.43.4 5] and has a large volume of distribution (reported to be between about 90 and
l40l).f 45 .46]
data on the tissue distribution of carebastine in
humans are unavailable; however, studies in rats
have shown the drug to achieve concentrations 36
times higher than plasma concentrations in the
liver, and 2 to 4 times higher in the kidney, mesenteric lymph nodes, lung, adrenal and submaxillary
glands and pancreas.[48]
the major pathway of excretion of 14c-iabelled
ebastine in humans is via the kidneys.f3 7] unpublished findings indicate that approximately 40% of
the drug is recovered in the urine over a 24-hour

2.1 effect of age, renal or
hepatic impairment

the pharmacokinetic properties of carebastine
in healthy elderly volunteers (aged;:::: 65 years) generally did not differ from those found in younger
adults (18 to 35 years) after administration of a single lomg oral dose of ebastine or during multipledose administration of 10 mg/day for 9 days.l44.4 6 ]
however, nakamura et aij 44 ] reported an increase
in tmax in elderly compared with younger volunteers: 7.0 versus 4.8 hours following administration of a single 10mg dose (table i).
unpublished studies[37] found that although tmax
was increased, other pharmacokinetic properties
of carebastine were not significantly altered in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine
clearance 1.8 to 3.6 lih/1.73m 2) compared with
healthy individuals (creatinine clearance 5.1 to 8.1
lih/1.73m 2). the increase in tmax was not considered to be clinically relevant. the t'l2~ of carebastine was significantly increased in patients with
severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 1.8

lihil.73m2 ) compared with healthy individuals
(23 to 26 versus 17 to 19 hours); however, other
parameters did not differ significantly. in individuals with hepatic impairment, the bioavailability of
carebastine did not differ significantly from that in
healthy individuals, whereas the tj/2~ of the drug
was increased.f3 7]
the pharmacokinetic properties of carebastine
were investigated in children aged 6 to 12 years
with allergic rhinitis.l 6 ] although tmax and t!,w values appeared to be similar to those observed in
healthy adults, c max values after a lomg dose appeared to be about 2-fold greater than values in
adults (0.21 versus 0.09 to 0.12 mg/l) and auc

2.2 drug interactions

ebastine, like terfenadine and other hi receptor
antagonists, is metabolised by the cytochrome
p450 enzyme family, to its carboxylated metabolite
carebastine.[33,34] concern has been raised that impairment of the hepatic metabolism of terfenadine
by drugs such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin and clarithromycin (which inhibit the cytochrome p450 enzyme cyp3a4) may be associated with the adverse cardiac events observed
occasionally during terfenadine therapy (see section 1.4).
unpublished study reports indicated that the
metabolism of ebastine was significantly slowed
when a single 20mg dose was administered to
healthy volunteers receiving multiple doses of either ketoconazole (400 mg/day) or erythromycin
(500mg every 6 hours).l 39 .40] plasma concentrations of the parent drug were significantly increased, from an undetectable level in those who
did not receive ketoconazole or erythromycin, to
between 20.3 and 55.7 f,lgll in patients receiving
either drug, respectively. auc values were increased, the apparent clearance was decreased by
63% and the ty2~ significantly increased (by about
5- and 2-fold when ebastine was coadministered
with ketoconazole or erythromycin).

ebastine: a review

in contrast, a study in 12 healthy volunteers
found cimetidine (also an inhibitor of p450 enzyme activity) at dosages up to l.6 g/day to have
no significant effect on the metabolism of ebastine
when administered 1 day before and 2 days after a
single oral dose of ebastine 20mg.[49]
ebastine 20 mg/day for 10 days did not have any
significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of a single oral dose of warfarin 25mg in 12
healthy volunteers.[so]

3. clinical efficacy
ebastine has proven to be a useful agent for the
treatment of symptoms of seasonal and perennial
allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria in
double-blind clinical trials. preliminary findings
from studies conducted in japan[si] also indicate
that ebastine is an effective treatment for pruritic
dermatoses such as eczema/dermatitis, prurigo and
cutaneous pruritus.
3.1 seasonal allergic rhinitis

seasonal allergic rhinitis, caused predominantly by ige-mediated release of histamine in response to inhalation of allergens (grass, tree or
weed pollens, or in some places mould), affects up
to 15% of the population and can cause significant
morbidity. [i]
the clinical efficacy of ebastine in improving
symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in adults and
children has been assessed by investigators and patients using visual analogue scales and/or diary
symptom scores.
significant symptom improvement, including
both nasal and non-nasal (rhinorrhoea and inflamed or watering eyes) symptoms was observed
in patients treated with ebastine 10 or 20mg once
daily compared with placebo in randomised double-blind studies (fig. 3; table ii). good or excellent clinical responses were achieved in 62 to 85%
of ebastine recipients compared with 33 to 63% of
those treated with placebo for 7 to 28 days.
ebastine 10 mg/day was generally comparable
in efficacy to 20 mg/day in dose-finding studies,[s8,61] although some studies found the higher

dosage administered in the morning offered greater
symptom improvement,[s9,60,62] particularly in patients with more severe symptoms,fs9] both dosages provided sustained symptom relief throughout 4-month study periods,f6o,63]
in randomised double-blind comparisons with
other histamine hi receptor antagonists, ebastine
lomg once daily was as effective in improving
symptoms as  xxxd236xxx  10mg once daily, terfenadine 60mg twice daily or cetirizine 10mg once
daily. ebastine 20mg once daily was more effective than cetirizine lomg once daily and tended to
be more effective than  xxxd2504xxx  lomg once daily
(table ii).
total symptom score and patient's discomfort
were improved to a significantly greater extent in
patients treated with ebastine 20 mg/day than in
those receiving ebastine 10 mg/day or cetirizine 10
mg/day for 1 week (p < 0.05) in an unpublished
study.[s9] however, the mean overall betweengroup differences at the end of a 2-week treatment
period were not significant. similar findings were

days (including rhinorrhoea, nasal obstruction,
sneezing, eye and nose itching), except pruritus,
which was improved to a greater extent in terfenadine recipients)64,65]
32 perennial allergic rhinitis

perennial rhinitis, which affects up to 20% of
the population, is caused primarily by exposure to
indoor allergens such as house dust mites, animal
saliva, excreta or dander, and moulds)l] the disease characteristics and pathogenesis are similar to
those of seasonal allergic rhinitis.
ebastine lomg once daily significantly reduced
symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis (including
nasal discharge, sneezing, itching eyes and nose,
watery eyes, cough and loss of taste) compared
with placebo in a multicentre double-blind study

which included 145 evaluable patients.[66] 55% of
patients treated with ebastine showed an excellent
(all or most of the above symptoms improved or
disappeared), good, or moderate (about half of
symptoms improved) improvement in symptoms,
compared with 32% of placebo recipients (p <
0.01). the incidence and severity of blocked nose,
sore throat and loss of smell remained similar in
ebastine and placebo recipients (table iii).
in dose-finding studies conducted in japanese
patients, similar response rates were achieved with
dosages of ebastine 5, 10 or 20mg administered
once daily for 1 or 2 weeks (table iii))67-69]
ebastine 5 and 10 mg/day dosages were of similar efficacy in relieving symptoms of perennial
allergic rhinitis in adolescents (aged 12 to 17 years)
treated for 2 weeks in a double-blind parallel group
study (response rates of 91 and 75%, respectively,
were not statistically significantly different)p2]

overall clinical response rates were similar in
patients treated with ebastine 5 mg/day or ketotifen
2 mg/day for 4 weeks in a double-blind comparative study,[70] although nasal obstruction was improved to a significantly greater extent after 4
weeks in ebastine recipients.
unpublished findings from a large double-blind
parallel group study[71] indicate that the clinical efficacy of ebastine 10mg once daily is similar to that
of other histamine hi receptor antagonists (including terfenadine 60mg twice daily, chlorpheniramine 6mg twice daily and  xxxd2572xxx  5mg twice
daily) [table iii].
3.3 chronic idiopathic urticaria

chronic idiopathic urticaria is characterised by
the occurrence of wheals and itching which may

persist for several months. the disease is termed
'idiopathic' , as causative factors provoking the release of histamine (and other vasoactive substances) from mast cells are rarely identified. the
clinical efficacy of ebastine in reducing the size and
number of wheals and providing relief from itching
in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria has
been investigated in dose-finding and double-blind
comparative studies (summarised in table iv).
dose-finding studies in japanese patients have
found ebastine to be effective in relieving symptoms at dosages of 5, 10 and 20mg once daily;
symptom relief was achieved in 50% of patients
after 3 days of drug administration.l 73 ,74] symptom
improvement was described as moderate or better

ebastine: a review

tients after 2 months' treatment in a noncomparative studyp9]
ebastine 10 mg/day for 2 to 12 weeks reduced
itching and the number and size of wheals in a significantly greater proportion of patients than did
placebo in 2 large double-blind studiesp5,76] on
the basis of investigators' assessments, symptom
relief was achieved in 76 of 95 patients (80%)
treated with ebastine for 2 weeks versus 52 of 102
placebo recipients (51%; p < 0.001))76] after 12
weeks' treatment, the overall response rates judged
by investigators in an intention-to-treat analysis
were 74% for ebastine recipients and 52% for patients treated with placebo (p < 0.005).[75) unpublished studies have found ebastine 10 or 20 mg/day
to provide symptom relief throughout a 12-month
follow-up period.[80,81] in one study, 66 of 131 patients initially participating in a i-month doubleblind placebo-controlled study continued on ebastine therapy for a 12-month period.[80]
in a multicentre double-blind comparative trial
with  xxxd236xxx  10 mg/day, ebastine 5 or 10 mg/day
initially appeared less effective in providing relief
from itching and in reducing wheal size; however,
both drugs were equally effective after 4 weeks'
treatment. [78] in a longer term study, ebastine 10mg
once daily was as effective as terfenadine 60mg
twice daily during a 3-month treatment period (table iv).[75] ebastine 10 mg/day was also found to
have similar efficacy to that of ketotifen 2 mg/day
after 2 weeks in a double-blind study conducted in
japanese patients; moderate or better responses
were achieved in 74 versus 67% of patients.[77]

4. tolerability
ebastine has been well tolerated in the majority
of patients in clinical trials in which ebastine was
administered at dosages of 5 to 20mg (or up to
40mg in 1 study[61]) once daily for 2 to 12
weeks. [52,54,56-59,66,68-70,73-79,82-84) its tolerability
has been rated as good or excellent in 74 to 94% of
patients in individual trials.l 56-59 ,75,76,78]
the incidence of adverse events was similar in
patients treated with ebastine 10 or 20 mg/day,[58,59]
and did not differ significantly from that reported

in placebo recipients (fig. 4).[56-58,61,66,75,76,78,82-85]
drowsiness, headache and dry mouth were the
most frequently reported adverse events in clinical
trials; however, they were generally mild to moderate in severity. other less frequent adverse events
included asthenia, gastrointestinal discomfort,
nausea/vomiting, increased appetite, diarrhoea,
constipation, and agitation. in long term clinical
studies, in which patients received ebastine 10 or
20 mg/day for up to 1 year, the most common adverse events were headache and gastrointestinal
disturbance. [81 ,86]
comparative trials to date have found ebastine
to be at least as well tolerated as other histamine
hi receptor antagonists including  xxxd236xxx ,[54,78]
terfenadine,[57,75] and cetirizine.l59 ] ebastine appeared to be better tolerated than  xxxd2504xxx  in a
large double-blind randomised study:f 56] the incidence of adverse events was significantly higher in
the  xxxd2504xxx  treatment group compared with in
the placebo group, whereas ebastine did not differ
significantly from placebo.
the withdrawal rate in patients treated with ebastine ranged between i and 6% in clinical trials and was
similar to that reported for placebo and other histamine hi receptor antagonists.[52,54,56,57,59,75,76,78]
ebastine did not cause clinically significant
changes in laboratory measurements (including serum chemistry, haematological parameters and urinalysis).
other histamine hi receptor antagonists (terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx ) have on rare occasions
been associated with potentially fatal ventricular
tachyarrhythmias (section 1.4). there have been
no reports of serious adverse cardiovascular events
in patients treated with ebastine in large multicentre clinical studies. analysis of pooled cardiac
data (from ecg measurement and 24-hour holter
monitoring) from a total of 842 patients treated
with ebastine i to 30 mg/day and 360 placebo recipients participating in 5 multicentre studies
found no patient to have a qtc interval> 500 msec

5. dosage and administration
ebastine is administered orally as a single daily
dose. a dosage of 10 mg/day is effective in the
treatment of adults with allergic rhinitis or chronic
idiopathic urticaria. the higher dosage of 20
mg/day may provide additional benefit in patients
with more severe symptoms and administration in
the morning provides optimal symptom relief.
ebastine 5 mg/day is recommended for the treatment of children.
caution is advised when administering ebastine
to patients with an established ecg qtc interval
prolongation, or hepatic or renal insufficiency.

6. place of ebastine in the
management of allergic disorders

a tremendous socioeconomic burden on the population.f87.88] the economic impact on society includes the direct costs of treatment and indirect
costs associated with reduced quality of life and
productivity of those affected. costs associated
with seasonal allergic rhinitis in the us in 1990
were estimated at sus 1.8 billion, with lost productivity accounting for over 33% of the total economic impact of the disease.[88]
antihistamines, which are extensively used for
the relief of symptoms in patients with allergic conditions, greatly improve patients' quality of life. in
addition, the second generation antihistamines
such as ebastine lack the significant sedative and
anticholinergic effects characteristic of first generation agents.
these agents relieve symptoms of seasonal and
perennial allergic rhinitis including pruritus,
sneezing, rhinorrhoea, and inflamed and watery
eyes, but generally provide little relief of nasal congestion.f 89,90] other treatment options include the
use of decongestants, corticosteroids (systemic and
drugs 1996 feb; 51 (2)

ebastine: a review

topical), mast cell stabilisers, mucolytics and anticholinergics.[2] antihistamines are the drugs of
choice for the treatment and prevention of symptoms of chronic idiopathic urticaria.
ebastine therapy is effective and well tolerated
in patients with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis, or chronic idiopathic urticaria. its long duration of action allows sustained symptom relief with
once daily administration. ebastine 10 or 20
mg/day has shown efficacy similar to that of standard doses of other second generation antihistamines including terfenadine, cetirizine,  xxxd236xxx 
and loratadine. the higher dosage of 20 mg/day
may be used to control more severe symptoms or
exacerbations.
ebastine has not been associated with serious
adverse cardiovascular effects in clinical trials, and
did not adversely affect the qtc interval in healthy
volunteers when coadministered with drugs which
inhibit cytochrome p450 isoenzymes (erythromycin and ketoconazole). the latter findings require
confirmation in large numbers of patients with allergies. in addition, the cardiac safety of the drug,
especially in overdosage, or in patients with preexisting hepatic or cardiovascular disease is unknown.
thus, clinical findings indicate that once daily
ebastine is an effective and well tolerated agent for
the treatment of allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, and is likely to be a useful alternative to other second generation antihistamines in
clinical use for first-line therapy of these allergic
conditions.
