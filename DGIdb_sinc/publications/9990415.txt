summary

a randomized, investigator masked, intra individual comparative study was conducted in 30
healthy volunteers to compare the cutaneous effects of  xxxd77xxx  0.1% gel and  xxxd77xxx  0.1%
cream with their respective vehicles, using tretinoin 0.05% cream (n = 21) or tretinoin 0.1% cream
(n = 9) and a  xxxd3417xxx  vehicle (n = 30) as controls. the products were applied to hip/
buttock skin for 4 days under occlusive conditions. cytosolic  xxxd3417xxx  binding protein-ii
( xxxg512xxx ) mrna levels were measured using the rt-pcr technique in punch biopsies taken from
10 subjects. epidermal thickness was assessed using image analysis of haematoxylin and eosin
stained sections from another 11 subjects. erythema was assessed in all subjects both by a visual
scoring system and by chromameter.
 xxxd77xxx  0.1% gel and  xxxd77xxx  0.1% cream produced similar significant increases in crabpii mrna levels compared to their vehicles (p 5 0.01). the two tretinoin formulations also resulted
in similar significant increases in  xxxg512xxx  compared to the cream vehicle (p 5 0.001). however,
only the two tretinoin formulations resulted in an increase in epidermal thickness and only the
tretinoin 0.1% cream resulted in significant erythema.
 xxxd77xxx  0.1% gel and  xxxd77xxx  0.1% cream induce rar-mediated gene expression to a
similar degree in this model, without the irritant effects of tretinoin.

 xxxd77xxx  is a novel naphthoic acid derivative
with selective  xxxg1932xxx /g agonist activity, which modulates cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro and
shows anti-inflammatory and comedolytic properties
in vivo.1 as compared to the standard retinoid agonist,
 xxxd3417xxx  (referred-to hereafter as tretinoin),
 xxxd77xxx  causes significantly less skin irrritation in a
variety of clinical pharmacology models2 and in clinical
trials in acne patients.3 however, it is at least as
effective as tretinoin in treating acne,4 implying that
efficacy is not necessarily linked to irritation.
the 4-day occlusion assay has been shown to be a
useful model for the evaluation of topical products with
retinoid agonist activity. using this model,  xxxd3417xxx

receptor (rar)-mediated events such as the induction
of cellular  xxxd3417xxx  binding protein ii ( xxxg512xxx )
gene expression5 can be differentiated from non-specific
irritant phenomena such as erythema and epidermal
hyperplasia.6 indeed, a previous study of  xxxd77xxx  in
this model gave results which were entirely consistent
with the clinical profile of the molecule: significant
induction of  xxxg512xxx  mrna, indicating stimulation of
rar-mediated gene expression, without the irritant
effects of tretinoin.7
in the 4-day occlusion assay, we compared the
effects of two different formulations of  xxxd77xxx , the
previously studied aqueous gel and a new cream which
is also well tolerated8 and effective in the treatment of
acne (company data, galderma, 1998). tretinoin was
used as a positive control.

lack of irritation from  xxxd77xxx 
subjects and methods
this was a randomized, investigator masked, intra
individual comparative study conducted in 30 healthy
volunteers. the protocol was approved by the salford
and trafford local ethics committee and each subject
provided written informed consent before participating
in the study.
treatment
each subject received applications of  xxxd77xxx  0.1%
gel (differin1 0.1% gel, galderma laboratories, sophiaantipolis, france) and  xxxd77xxx  0.1% cream with
their respective vehicle controls. twenty-one of the
subjects also received tretinoin 0.05% cream (retacnyl1 0.05% cream, galderma laboratories) and the
nine others tretinoin 0.1% cream ( xxxd3417xxx  1 0.1%
cream, ortho laboratories); all 30 received the vehicle
of the tretinoin 0.05% cream as an additional control.
the products were applied to hip/buttock skin for 4
days under occlusive conditions (opsite1 dressing)
according to a randomization scheme which ensured
that each active product was symmetrically located
relative to the corresponding vehicle.

for measurement of  xxxg512xxx  mrna levels by the
semiquantitative rt-pcr technique, using mrna for
the enzyme  xxxg861xxx  as an internal reference. in
another 11 subjects, epidermal thickness from the base
of the stratum corneum to the basement membrane of
the inter rete ridges was assessed using image analysis
(quantimet 600s) of haematoxylin and eosin stained
sections from 4-mm punch biopsies.
statistical methodology
statistical analysis was conducted using analysis of
variance for continuous variables and two-sided rank
sign test for erythema scores.  xxxg512xxx  levels were
logarithmically transformed before analysis. each
active product was compared to its corresponding
vehicle (this was thus not possible for the tretinoin
0.1% cream formulation), and the two  xxxd77xxx 
formulations were each compared to tretinoin 0.05%
cream and tretinoin 0.1% cream. statistical significance was defined as p 5 0.01 to compensate for
multiple comparisons.

at the end of the 4-day application period, erythema
was assessed in all subjects by a visual scoring system
using a 10-point scale (0 = absent; 1±3 = mild; 4±
6 = moderate; 7±9 = severe) and by the a* value of the
l*a* b* scale system as measured by colorimeter
(minolta chromameter cr-200, minolta, osaka, japan). in 10 subjects, 6 mm punch biopsies were taken

as shown in fig. 1,  xxxd77xxx  0.1% gel and  xxxd77xxx 
0.1% cream each produced approximately 2-fold
increases in  xxxg512xxx  mrna levels compared to their
vehicles (p 4 0.001). the two tretinoin formulations resulted in 3-to 4-fold increases in  xxxg512xxx 
(p 5 0.001 for comparison of 0.05% concentration
vs. vehicle).

epidermal thickness

discussion

as shown in fig. 2, only the two tretinoin formulations
resulted in an increase in epidermal thickness, which
amounted to 30% for the tretinoin 0.05% cream
(p 5 0.01) and 74% for the tretinoin 0.1% cream.

the results of this study are consistent with those of
previously published data7 which showed that  xxxd77xxx  was able to induce expression of mrna for
 xxxg512xxx  (a marker of nuclear  xxxd3417xxx  receptor
agonist activity) while not inducing erythema or
epidermal hyperplasia (which appear to be the result
of non-specific irritant activity of all trans retinoic
acid6). in turn, the results of this short-term model
correlate well with those of clinical trials in acne
patients, where  xxxd77xxx  was equally efficacious as
tretinoin, but significantly better tolerated.3,4
interestingly, the gel and cream formulations of
 xxxd77xxx  gave the same degree of  xxxg512xxx  expression, and a similar absence of signs of irritation. on the
other hand, the tretinoin 0.05% cream formulation
appeared to induce much less erythema and epidermal
hyperplasia than tretinoin 0.1% cream, while main-

erythema
as shown in fig. 3, only the tretinoin 0.1% cream
formulation resulted in clinically significant erythema
(mean score of 3 compared to less than 1 for each of the
other products). according to the colorimetry a*
readings (fig. 4), which represent an objective measure
of skin redness, the erythema produced by tretinoin
0.1% cream was significantly greater than that by
either  xxxd77xxx  formulation (p 4 0.001). see also

tretinoin or vehicle. there is no significant
difference in epidermal thickness between
either formulation of  xxxd77xxx  and their
vehicles, but tretinoin produces significant
epidermal thickening. epidermal thickness is
measured from the base of the stratum
corneum to the basement membrane of the
inter rete ridges. values are means + sem,
n = 11. *p = 0. 011 vs.  xxxd77xxx  gel,

taining at least as much increase in  xxxg512xxx 
expression. the latter finding may be explained either
by  xxxg512xxx  expression being a more sensitive marker
of retinoid activity, or alternatively by the influence of
the vehicle formulation on the skin tolerance profile.

unfortunately, the tretinoin 0.1% vehicle was not
tested so direct comparisons cannot be made. nevertheless, the findings further support the hypothesis that
retinoid agonist activity is not necessarily proportional
to the degree of skin irritation, and that the two
