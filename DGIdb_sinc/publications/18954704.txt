summary of putative effects
of corticosteroids
corticosteroids interfere with almost all the components of the inflammatory chain (table 1). these effects have been described elsewhere.4 briefly, at
the molecular level, corticosteroids have very rapid
(within minutes) nongenomic effects via interaction
with membrane sites or the release of chaperone
proteins from the  xxxg1601xxx . these
effects include mainly a modulation of cellular
responses with a decrease in cell adhesion and
 xxxd1075xxx  kinases, and an increase in
annexin 1 externalization. then, in a few hours,
mainly through sequestration of transcription
factors in the cytosol, corticosteroids induce transrepression, resulting in inhibition of cell trafficking
and a decrease in synthesis of proinflammatory
mediators, such as cytokines, adhesion molecules,
and receptors. finally, in a few days, corticosteroids induce transactivation with up-regulation of
phagocytosis, chemokinesis, and antioxidant

septic shock remains a deadly disease that places
a burden on the health care system.1 recent advances in the understanding of the pathomechanisms of sepsis have highlighted the complex
interplay among the immune, coagulation, and
neuroendocrine systems in response to severe infection. the discovery that the imbalance between
pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways may have
a role has led to the notion that treatment should
be aimed at modulating these systems, rather
than blocking key steps in the complex cascade
of events triggered by an infection. meanwhile,
interest in the use of low-dose corticosteroids
has revived and a new class of drugs‚Äîrecombinant human  xxxg1847xxx ‚Äîhas been developed. both therapeutic approaches have shown
a promising benefit/risk profile in clinical studies.2,3 however, more recent studies in different
populations failed to confirm findings from initial
studies of survival benefits from these treatments.
this review summarizes the current knowledge on
the benefit/risk profile from low-dose corticosteroids and  xxxg1847xxx .

processes, and of various mechanisms of resolution of inflammation. in addition, corticosteroid effects may vary with cell activation state. for
example, they can increase or decrease the expression of innate immunity proteins, such as
toll-like receptors 2 and 4.
glucocorticoids interact with myochardial fibers
and smooth muscle in blood vessels, maintaining
vascular tone, endothelium integrity, capillary permeability, and myocardial inotropic activity. glucocorticoids act in synergy with norepinephrine and
 xxxg99xxx . the mechanisms of these cardiovascular effects are still unclear. it is likely that very early
effects (within minutes) are nongenomic and may result from a direct action of corticosteroids on vascular smooth muscles as well as up-regulation of
 xxxg1577xxx   xxxg1579xxx . more sustained effects are likely genomic through inhibition of the transcription of the genes‚Äô encoding for the inducible

finally, corticosteroids may induce or foster apoptosis in different cells and tissues: t lymphocytes,
eosinophils, osteoblasts, osteocytes, the hippocampus, and fibroblasts.9 they may also prevent
premature death of neutrophils, erythroblasts,
and cells of the mammary gland, ovaries, and liver.9

summary of findings in randomized
controlled trials
the effects of corticosteroids in patients with
severe sepsis or septic shock have been investigated in controlled clinical trials for about half
a century. two meta-analyses highlighted more
than a decade ago the unfavorable benefit/risk ratio of a short course of high-dose corticosteroids in

corticosteroids and human recombinant apc
sepsis.10,11 in the 90s, the demonstration that
an inappropriate endogenous neuroendocrine
response to infection plays a role in the pathomechanisms and prognosis of sepsis has prompted
renewed interest in the use of corticosteroids at
lower doses and for a longer period.12,13 recently,
the term critical illness‚Äìrelated corticosteroid
insufficiency (circi) has been introduced to help
recognize this complication of sepsis. briefly,
circi can result from impaired cortisol synthesis
or tissue resistance to corticosteroids.
several small studies have reported a decrease
in the duration of vasopressor therapy withdrawal
with low doses of corticosteroids.14‚Äì18 two of
these studies suggested a survival benefit from
a long course of low-dose corticosteroids.14,16
there are two large, multicenter, randomized,
placebo-controlled, double-blind studies2,19 evaluating the efficacy and safety of a low dose of
corticosteroids in septic shock. in the first study,
300 vasopressor- and ventilator-dependent septic
shock patients were randomized within the first
8 hours to receive 50 mg hydrocortisone as intravenous bolus every 6 hours and 50 mg of fludrocortisone via the gastric tube once a day for 7 days.
more patients in the corticosteroid group than
in the placebo group had shock reversed (57%
versus 40%). also, among those patients whose
shock was reversed, reversal occurred faster in
the corticosteroid group than in the placebo group
(approximately 2 days earlier). twenty-eight-day
mortality was significantly decreased in the experimental group (61% versus 55%). corticosteroid
effects were mostly seen in the group of patients
who did not respond to a short  xxxd1752xxx 
test (63% versus 53%). no evidence was found
for an increased risk of gastroduodenal bleeding,
superinfection, or neuromuscular weakness. subsequently, two updates of the systematic review
on the use of corticosteroids in septic shock20,21
and the surviving sepsis campaign22 have recommended that low-dose hydrocortisone should be
considered in the management of septic shock,
although corticosteroid therapy may favor onset
of critical illness polyneuromyopathy.23,24
more recently, the european corticosteroid
therapy of septic shock (corticus) trial reported
conflicting results.19 in that study, patients were
included if they met all of the following criteria:
clinical evidence of infection, two of the four signs
of systemic inflammatory response syndrome,
a systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm hg
despite adequate fluid replacement or need for
vasopressors for at least 1 hour within the previous 72 hours, and at least one sign of hypoperfusion or organ dysfunction attributable to sepsis.
five hundred patients were randomized to

receive 50 mg of intravenous hydrocortisone every 6 hours for 5 days, then every 12 hours for
3 days and once daily for 3 days. fludrocortisone
was not used in this study. this study confirmed
that hydrocortisone treatment accelerated shock
reversal, though at 28 days the proportion of patients with shock reversed was not significantly
greater in the treated patients versus those receiving a placebo. in addition, though the rate
of specific superinfection was the same for
groups, some patients in the hydrocortisone
group experienced new episodes of shock. finally, the corticosteroid therapy increased the
risk of hyperglycemia and hypernatremia. the
main limitations of the corticus study included
(1) a lack of power with only 500 patients out of
the expected 800 and a lower baseline risk of
death than expected (observed placebo mortality
in the nonresponders 36% versus expected mortality of 50%); and (2) a selection bias with a very
slow recruitment rate following the loss of equipoise among the investigators, resulting in predominantly surgical sepsis with an intraabdominal source.
thus, the french study and corticus came to
opposite conclusions with some similarities and
major differences between the two studies. similarities between the two studies included the
findings that steroids offer beneficial effects in
shortening the time to shock reversal, that the
use of steroids did not increase risk of neuromuscular weakness, and that steroids increased the
risk of hyperglycemia. differences between the
two studies included:
differences in timing: time window allowed for
inclusion (8 versus 72 hours) resulting in
only early septic shock in the french study
and both early and late septic shock in the
corticus study
difference in types, duration, and doses of
corticosteroids: fludrocortisone versus no
fludrocortisone; treatment duration (7 versus
11 days); weaning (none versus tapering in
6 days)
differences in populations: severity of shock‚Äî
systolic blood pressure <90 mm hg
(>1 hour versus <1 hour); general severity
of illness‚Äîsimplified acute physiology ii
scores (59 versus 49); proportion of nonresponders to  xxxd1752xxx  (77% versus
47%); proportion of medical patients
(66% versus 36%); primary source of infection (lung versus abdomen)
differences in context: practice guidelines not
recommending steroids versus guidelines
recommending use of hydrocortisone

summary of current recommendations
a recent update of the cochrane systematic review
of corticosteroids for severe sepsis and septic
shock suggested that a prolonged (>5 days) treatment with low-dose hydrocortisone (200 mg per
day of hydrocortisone or equivalent) is associated
with survival benefit. this meta-analysis included
12 trials accounting for 1230 patients. the relative
risk of death was 0.86 (95% ci: 0.75‚Äì0.98) in favor
of corticosteroids. there was no evidence for
heterogeneity across the studies (heterogeneity:
c211 5 11.29 (p 5 .42); i2 5 3%).
the surviving sepsis campaign has recently updated the guidelines for the use of corticosteroids
on the basis of the most recent data, including
corticus findings.25 in these guidelines, the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (grade) system was used
to quantify the strength of the recommendation.
given that the two largest trials had conflicting
results, the grade could only be 2 (ie, a suggestion)
and not a 1 (ie, a recommendation). given that the
two trials focused on very different populations,
the recommendation tried to limit the use of
corticosteroids to those patients mimicking entry
criteria in the french trial:
we suggest intravenous hydrocortisone
should be given only to adult septic shock patients after blood pressure is identified to be
poorly responsive to fluid resuscitation and
vasopressor therapy (2c).
the guidelines did not recommend the use of
fludrocortisones, nor did they recommend guiding
corticosteroid therapy on the results of the
 xxxd1755xxx  test.
subsequently, given the broad use of corticosteroids and the remaining uncertainty surrounding
their benefit/risk profile in different septic shock
populations, further adequately powered clinical
trials are needed. such trials are ongoing. two
large randomized controlled trials, nct00320099
and nct00368381, are comparing the efficacy
and safety of hydrocortisone alone versus hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone in septic shock. another randomized trial, nct00625209, has a 22
factorial design to compare hydrocortisone and
fludrocortisone with each other, with a recombinant
human  xxxg1847xxx , with a combination of
these, and with placebos.

human recombinant  xxxg1847xxx 
summary of putative effects
an imbalance from an increased activation of
coagulation and a decrease in fibrinolysis is the

hallmark of sepsis (see table 1). the subsequent
generation of thrombi in the vessels may impair
organ perfusion and may activate the endothelium
and immune cells. the protein c pathway plays
a key role in preventing microvascular thrombosis.
indeed, the thrombin- xxxg2277xxx  complex
activates protein c, which in turn binds to protein
s and inhibits the coagulation factors va and viiia,
which are necessary for thrombin formation. moreover,  xxxg1847xxx  up-regulates fibrinolysis
mainly by inactivating plasminogen activator inhibitor‚Äì1. additionally, activation of endothelial cell
 xxxg1848xxx  ( xxxg1848xxx ) increases protein c
activation.26
by restoring the haemostatic balance in sepsis,
 xxxg1847xxx  has indirect anti-inflammatory
effects. indeed, thrombin fosters the release of
inflammatory mediators.  xxxg1847xxx  is
also likely to have direct effects on inflammation.
for example, the binding of  xxxg1847xxx 
to  xxxg1848xxx  prevents the translocation of nuclear
factor k b to the nucleus.27
a growing body of evidence indicates that  xxxg1847xxx  favorably modulates endothelial
cell apoptosis. in fact, activation of  xxxg1848xxx  up-regulates endothelial protease activated receptor‚Äì1, the
phosphorylation rate of mitogen-activated protein
kinases, and  xxxg250xxx -homolog protein (inhibiting
apoptosis); and down-regulates p53, a well-known
proapoptotic factor.28‚Äì30

summary of findings in randomized
clinical trials
the recombinant human protein c worldwide
evaluation in severe sepsis (prowess) study3
was a phase iii randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial that investigated
the efficacy and safety of a recombinant human
 xxxg1847xxx , drotrecogin alpha activated
(drot-aa). the study included 1690 patients with
a known or suspected infection, three or four criteria of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and one or more sepsis-induced organ
dysfunction. the treatment was infused at a dose
of 24 mg/kg/h for 96 hours and was initiated within
24 hours after the patients met inclusion criteria.
the dose was previously defined in a phase ii trial
as the dose associated with the best effects on
serum d-dimer and il-6 levels.31 the primary
endpoint was 28-day mortality. the study was
stopped prematurely after the second interim
analysis for treatment efficacy. the mortality rate
was 30.8% in the placebo group and 24.7% in
the drot-aa group (p 5 .005). the relative risk of
death was 0.80 (95% ci: 0.69‚Äì0.94). the absolute
reduction of mortality was 6.1% (1.9%‚Äì10.4%).

corticosteroids and human recombinant apc
the treatment effect on survival was unrelated to
serum levels of  xxxg1847xxx . the study
drug was associated with an increased risk of
serious bleeding (3.5% versus 2%, p 5 .06), with
0.2% of patients with intracranial bleeding. the
study had some limitations, including amendment
of the protocol after enrolment of 720 patients to
modify exclusion criteria and to change the placebo (0.9%  xxxd3213xxx  was replaced
by 0.1% human  xxxg124xxx ) and, 5 months
later, a modification in the manufacturing of the
study drug. interestingly, regulatory agencies in
the united states and in europe approved the
marketing of drot-aa in prowess subgroups. the
us food and drug administration defined the subgroup as those with an acute physiology and
chronic health evaluation (apache) ii score of
25 or more. the european agency for the evaluation of medical products defined the subgroup
according to the presence of two or more organs
with sepsis-induced dysfunctions. it was thought
that the benefit/risk profile was best in the sickest
patients.32 indeed, post hoc analyses of the prowess study showed a trend toward higher mortality
rates in drot-aa‚Äìtreated patients whose apache
ii score was below 20 (15.1% versus 12.1% for
placebo), and no evidence for patients whose
apache ii score was between 20 and 24, or for
those who had a single organ dysfunction.
regulatory agencies requested additional randomized controlled trials to evaluate the benefit/
risk profile of drot-aa in (1) patients with mild to
moderate sepsis (ie, apache ii score of less
than 25 or one organ dysfunction), (2) children
with sepsis, and (3) patients with concomitant
heparin treatment.
the efficacy and safety of drot-aa, at a dose of
24 mg/kg/h for 96 hours, in mild to moderate sepsis
was investigated in the administration of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) in early stage severe sepsis
(address) study group.33 this was a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial. patients were included if they had a suspected or known infection, a sepsis-induced organ
dysfunction, and were not eligible for commercially available xigris (ie, they had an apache ii
score of less than 25 if they were united states patients, or, if they were european patients, they had
two or more organ dysfunctions). the study was
stopped for futility after the second interim analysis and inclusion of 2640 patients. there was no
evidence for a difference in 28-day mortality
between placebo and drot-aa (17.0% versus
18.5%). there was a significant increase in the
rate of serious bleeding with drot-aa (3.9% versus
2.2%, p 5 .02). interestingly enough, in the united
states, patients with an apache ii score of less

than 25 and two or more organ dysfunctions could
have been enrolled in this study. similarly, in
europe, patients with one organ dysfunction and
an apache ii score of more than 25 could have
been enrolled in the address trial. then, post hoc
analysis in patients with an apache ii score of
more than 25 showed a 28-day mortality of
24.7% and 29.5% in the placebo and drot-aa
groups, respectively. in patients with two or more
organ dysfunctions, 28-day mortality rates were
21.9% and 20.7% in the placebo and drot-aa
groups, respectively. nevertheless, in these two
populations with severe sepsis among the
address population, the basal risk of death was
much lower than in the corresponding subgroups
from the prowess trial. in the subgroup of patients
with apache ii scores of 25 or more, placebo
mortality was 27.4% versus 43.7% in the address
and prowess trials, respectively. in the subgroup
of patients with two or more organ dysfunctions,
it was 21.9% versus 33.9%, respectively.
in both the prowess and address trials, exploratory analysis suggested an increased 28-day
mortality in patients who had one organ dysfunction and a recent surgery before drot-aa treatment.
one phase iii randomized controlled trial (the
researching severe sepsis and organ dysfunction in children: a global perspective [resolve]
trial) investigated the benefit/risk profile of drotaa at a dose of 24 mg/kg/h for 96 hours in 477 children with severe sepsis.34 children were eligible if
they were between 38 weeks corrected gestational age and 17 years old; had suspected or
proven infection; showed signs of systemic inflammation; and had cardiovascular and respiratory
organ dysfunctions. the primary objective was to
calculate a composite score called the composite
time to complete organ failure resolution
(ctcofr). there was no evidence for a difference
in ctcofr or in 28-day mortality (17.5% versus
17.2%). drot-aa treatment was associated with
an increase in the risk of intracranial bleeding
(4.6% versus 2.6% of episodes), particularly in
the youngest patients.
the interaction between drot-aa and heparin
was tested in the xigris and prophylactic heparin
evaluation in severe sepsis (x-press) randomized
controlled trial. in this trial, 1994 patients eligible
for commercially available xigris were randomized
to receive heparin or a placebo every 12 hours
during drot-aa infusion. this was an equivalencedesign trial. twenty-eight‚Äìday mortality rates were
28.3% versus 31.9% (p 5 .09) in the heparin and
placebo-treated patients, respectively. there was
no evidence for an increased proportion of serious
bleeding events with the use of prophylactic heparin (3.8% versus 5.2%, p 5 .06). there were fewer

(0.5% versus 1.8%, p 5 .01). interestingly enough,
patients who were receiving heparin before
randomization and were allocated to heparin had
a lower 28-day mortality rate than the placebotreated patients (26.9% versus 35.6%, p 5 .03).

recommendations
a recent cochrane systematic review35 suggested
that the use of drot-aa be suspended pending the
results of additional trials. this systematic review
included four studies accounting for 4911 patients.
in the group of patients with an apache ii score of
less than 25, the relative risk of death was 1.04
(95% ci: 0.89‚Äì1.21, p 5 .70). in the group of
patients with an apache ii score of 25 or more,
the relative risk of death was 0.90 (95% ci:
0.54‚Äì1.49).
the recent update of the surviving sepsis campaign yielded different conclusions.25 the panel of
experts suggested:
that adult patients with sepsis-induced organ
dysfunction associated with a clinical assessment of high risk of death, most of whom will
have acute physiology and chronic health
evaluation (apache) ii of 25 or more, or
multiple organ failure, receive rhapc [recombinant  xxxg1847xxx ] if there are
no contraindications (grade 2b except for
patients within 30 days of surgery, for whom
it is grade 2c).
they also recommended
that adult patients with severe sepsis and low
risk of death, most of whom will have

apache ii <20 or one organ failure, do not
receive rhapc (grade 1a).
the benefit/risk profile of drot-aa is likely
inversely related to the time elapsed from onset
of the first sepsis-induced organ dysfunction,
with maximal benefit if administered within the first
24 hours.36 in addition, its benefit/risk profile may
be greater in the medical population than among
surgical patients. finally, prophylactic heparin
should not be stopped when initiating drot-aa.
given the very low rate of prescription of xigris in
practice, and given the uncertainty surrounding
the criteria to identify the population with the
optimal benefit/risk profile, additional trials are
needed. upon the request of the european agency
for the evaluation of medical products, drug maker
eli lilly and co. has launched a new multinational,
randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial
(nct00604214) to clarify the efficacy and safety of
a treatment with 24 mg/kg/h for 96 hours with
drot-aa in 1500 patients with severe septic shock.
another trial (nct00625209), this one academicdriven, has been launched in france and will
compare, in a 22 factorial design, the efficacy
and safety of low doses of corticosteroids, drotaa, their combination, and placebos, in 1280
cases of severe septic shock.

summary
in addition to antibiotic therapy and symptomatic
treatment, low doses of corticosteroids and  xxxg1847xxx  should still be considered as valuable adjuvant therapies in patients with septic
shock. for both therapies, good experimental
and clinical evidence shows their efficacy in

corticosteroids and human recombinant apc
decreasing septic shock morbidity and mortality.
both drugs may have serious adverse events.
therefore, ongoing investigations aim at defining
the optimal target population for corticosteroids
and  xxxg1847xxx . in the meantime, physicians should consider using low-dose corticosteroids and drot-aa in the treatment of patients
with vasopressor-dependent septic shock with
persistent signs of hypoperfusion, organ dysfunction, or hypotension (fig. 1). the optimal timing for
initiating these treatments is from 6 to 24 hours
from onset of shock. when patients are receiving
these drugs, physicians should systematically
screen for superinfection and serious bleeding
events.
