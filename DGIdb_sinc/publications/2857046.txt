summary
experiments were carried out to study the r e l a t i o n s h i p between
binding a f f i n i t y to the benzodiazepine receptor and pharmacological
a c t i v i t y , especially a n t i - a n x i e t y a c t i v i t y , of c l i n i c a l l y useful
benzodiazepines.
in the in v i t r o experiments,  xxxd2121xxx  showed the highest
a f f i n i t y to the benzodiazepine receptor with 4 times more potency
than that of diazepam, which paralleled the in vivo a c t i v i t y .
diazepam and nimetazepam also bound with high a f f i n i t i e s as expected
from t h e i r in vivo a c t i v i t i e s .
on the contrary, medazepam and
cloxazolam showed extremely low a f f i n i t i e s and oxazolam showed no
a f f i n i t y , although they showed moderate in vivo a c t i v i t y .
however, t h e i r metabolites were found to have both high a f f i n i t y and
in vivo a c t i v i t i e s .
these results strongly suggest that in the
case of medazepam, cloxazolam and oxazolam, t h e i r metabolites may
bind to receptor s i t e s in the brain and then e l i c i t pharmacological
action.
this conclusion was supported by the fact that a good
c o r r e l a t i o n between the binding a f f i n i t y and the a n t i - a n x i e t y
a c t i v i t y of the tested compounds was observed.
i t is well known that the benzodiazepine (bdz) receptor exists in the
synaptosomal membrane of various animals including man ( i - 3 ) .
braestrup et
al. reported that the binding a f f i n i t y of a series of benzodiazepines to bdz
receptor was correlated to pharmacological a c t i v i t y (4).
however, in the course of our studies on determining the r e l a t i o n s h i p
between binding a f f i n i t y to bdz receptor and pharmacological a c t i v i t y ,
especially a n t i - a n x i e t y action, of c l i n i c a l l y useful benzodiazepines
( xxxd2121xxx , diazepam, nimetazepam, medazepam, cloxazolam and oxazolam), we
found that medazepam and cloxazolam had extremely low a f f i n i t i e s to the
receptor and oxazolam had no a f f i n i t y , in spite of the fact that they a l l had
moderate in vivo a c t i v i t i e s .
in this paper, we report the results of in vivo
and in v i t r o experiments that explain this discrepancy.

our l a b o r a t o r i e s .
t r i t i a t e d diazepam (methyl-[3h], s p e c i f i c a c t i v i t y 85
mci/mmole) was purchased from amersham i n t e r n a t i o n a l ltd.
other drugs and
reagents were obtained from commercial sources.
in v i v o experiments
a n t i - c o n f l i c t tests were performed according to the method of vogel (5).
b r i e f l y , groups of 8 male wistar rats (170-200 g), which were deprived of water
f o r 48 h p r i o r to the t e s t , were used.
t h i r t y min a f t e r i n t r a p e r i t o n e a l
i n j e c t i o n ( 0 . i ml/]o g) of t e s t compounds, each r a t was placed in the t e s t
chamber and then the number of shocks d e l i v e r e d during a 3 min session was
recorded.
the potencies of tested compounds were i n d i c a t e d with the m i n i m a l l y
e f f e c t i v e doses, which were defined as the lowest dose producing a s t a t i s t i c a l l y s i g n i f i c a n t (p < 0.05, student's t e s t ) increase in shocks over c o n t r o l .
preparation of the synaptosomal membrane
preparation of the synaptosomal membrane was c a r r i e d out according to
moehler and okada's method (6).
b r i e f l y , the cerebral cortex from male wistar
rats (100-130 g) was homogenized in 20 volumes of i c e - c o l d 0.32 m sucrose using
a t e f l o n - g l a s s homogenizer.
the homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 x g f o r
i0 min at 4 ° c.
the supernatant was recentrifuged at 20,000 x g f o r 20 min
at 4° c.
the p e l l e t was resuspended in 20 volumes of i c e - c o l d 50 mm tris-hci
b u f f e r (ph 7.4) with a polytron homogenizer.
the homogenate was recentrifuged
at 20,000 x g f o r 20 min at 4 ° c.
the f i n a l p e l l e t was resuspended and
d i l u t e d with the above b u f f e r to y i e l d a synaptosomal membrane suspension with
the required p r o t e i n concentration ( i . 0 mg p r o t e i n / m l ) .
the p r o t e i n
concentration was measured by the method of lowry et a l . (7).
in v i t r o experiments
an a l i q u o t (i ml) of synaptosomal membrane suspension (i mg p r o t e i n ) was
added to the assay tubes containing t e s t i n h i b i t o r s at varying concentrations
(from 0 . i nm to 104 nm) and [3h]-diazepam (0.6 nm) in 2 ml of 50 mm tris-hcl
b u f f e r (ph 7.4).
the assay mixtures were incubated at 4 ° c f o r 15 min.
the incubation was terminated by adding i c e - c o l d 50 mm tris-hcl b u f f e r (5 ml)
followed by rapid f i l t r a t i o n
through a whatman gf/b f i l t e r .
each f i l t e r was
immediately washed twice with i c e - c o l d 50 mm tris-hcl b u f f e r (5 ml)
the bound [3h]-diazepam retained on the f i l t e r was extracted with acs i !
(amersham)(lo ml) and counted.
a l l incubations were done in t r i p l i c a t e .
nonspecific binding was determined in tubes containing diazepam at a f i n a l
concentration of 103 nm.
s p e c i f i c binding was calculated by subtracting the
nonspecific binding from the t o t a l binding.
ic50 values were determined from the displacement curves of percent
i n h i b i t i o n of [3h]-diazepam binding versus i n h i b i t o r concentration and were
the average of f i v e experiments.
results and discussion
in v i v o experiments
to evaluate in v i v o potency, e s p e c i a l l y the a n t i - a n x i e t y a c t i o n , of
benzodiazepines and t h e i r m e t a b o l i t e s , a n t i - c o n f l i c t t e s t s were performed in
rats.
the r e s u l t s are summarized in table i .
the order of potency of the
tested compounds was  xxxd2121xxx  = desmethylfludiazepam > diazepam = nimetazepam = desmethyldiazepam = chlordesmethyldiazepam > nitrazepam = oxazepam =
medazepam = cloxazolam >> oxazolam.

 xxxd2121xxx  and i t s metabolite, desmethylfludiazepam (8), showed the
highest anti-anxiety action; approximately twice higher than diazepam.
the a c t i v i t i e s of nimetazepam, desmethyldiazepam (the major metabolite of
diazepam (g), medazepam (i0) and oxazolam ( i i ) ) and chlordesmethyldiazepam
(the major metabolite of cloxazolam (12)) were similar to that of diazepam.
nitrazepam (the major metabolite of nimetazepam (13)), oxazepam (the minor
metabolite of oxazolam ( i i ) ) , medazepam and cloxazolam had approximately a half
potency of diazepam.
oxazolamwas 15 times less potent than diazepam.

i n v i t r o experiments
the i n h i b i t i o n of [3h]-diazepam binding to the bdz receptor by
benzodiazepines is shown in fig. i.
their binding a f f i n i t i e s are expressed
as the i n h i b i t i o n constans (ki), which are calculated from the ic50 values.
ki values and r e l a t i v e potencies are summarized in table i i .
among the tested benzodiazepines,  xxxd2121xxx  with a ki of 1.20 nm was the
most potent i n h i b i t o r of [3h]-diazepam binding to the receptor.
i t possessed
approximately 4 fold higher a f f i n i t y than diazepam which had a ki value of
5.00 nm.
nimetazepam showed a ki of 8.52 nm, indicating approximately 60%
a f f i n i t y as compared with that of diazepam.
the a f f i n i t i e s of  xxxd2121xxx ,
diazepam and nimetazepam were properly high and paralleled t h e i r pharmacological potencies described above.
medazepam and cloxazolam, however, had extremely low ki values of 953 and
1940 nm, respectively.
moreover, oxazolam showed no i n h i b i t o r y action at any
concentration tested, indicating no a f f i n i t y to the receptor.
these results
were unexpected from t h e i r pharmacological potencies in rats.

in fact, both medazepam and cloxazolam showed 50% in vivo potency of that of
diazepam and even oxazolam showed 6.6% potency.
i t was thought that such
discrepancy could be explained by supposing that the in vivo action of these
drugs might be caused by their metabolites rather than by the intact drugs
themselves, because their metabolites had considerably high anti-anxiety
action as shown in table i.
to prove this hypothesis, the binding a f f i n i t i e s
of the metabolites were evaluated.

ki values were derived from ic50 values according to the
relationship ki = ic50/(l + s/kd), where s is the concentration
of [3h]-diazepam and kd is i t s dissociation constant (3.6 nm).
each value is the mean ± standard error of the mean for five
determinations.
displacement curves for the inhibition of [3h]-diazepam binding by various
metabolites is shown in fig. 2 and ki values with relative potencies are
summarized in table i i .
desmethyldiazepam, the major metabolite of oxazolam, showed nearly the
same ki value (5.40 nm) as that of diazepam. oxazepam, a minor metabolite of
oxazolam, showed a ki of 15.1 nm, which was s t i l l much higher than that of the
intact drug.
these finding strongly suggest that desmethyldiazepam, instead
of oxazolam, may actually bind to the bdz receptor and cause in vivo action.
this is supported by the metabolic studies on oxazolam. oxazolam is known to
be rapidly biotransformed in rats to desmethyldiazepam, which exists as a major
metabolite in the brain 40 min after i.p. administration (14).
likewise, in the case of cloxazolam, i t s metabolite, chlordesmethyldiazepam, had a high a f f i n i t y (ki of 2.00 nm), implying approximately l,o00
times the potency of cloxazolam, so that its in vivo action could be attributed

118

bdz binding and anti-anxiolytic action

vol. 36, no. 2, 1985

to chlordesmethyldiazepam.
considering that medazepam is biotransformed
in vivo to diazepam and desmethyldiazepam, which have approximately 200 fold
higher a f f i n i t y than medazepam, we also suppose that these metabolites actually
e l i c i t in vivo action.
on the other hand, in the case of  xxxd2121xxx , diazepam and nimetazepam,
the a f f i n i t i e s of the corresponding metabolites were not so different from
those of the intact drugs.
therefore, i t can be assumed that either the
intact drugs or their metabolites are associated with their pharmacological
actions.

in fig. 3.
a good correlation with the correlation coefficient of r = 0.944
(p < o.ol) was observed when medazepam, cloxazolam and oxazolam were omitted.
in conclusion, the present study suggests the following: l)  xxxd2121xxx 
has a very high a f f i n i t y to bdz receptor, being about 4 times more potent than
diazepam; 2) in the case of medazepam, cloxazolam and oxazolam, their in vivo

action may be caused by their metabolites but not unchanged drugs; 3) although
generally in vivo pharmacological activity of drugs cannot be directly
estimated by binding a f f i n i t y to the receptor because of effects caused by
absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of the drugs, evaluation of
the binding a f f i n i t y to the bdz receptor in v i t r o can be one of the useful
tools for screening new anti-anxiety drugs or examining the mechanism of their
pharmacological action.
