expert opinion

introduction: metastatic melanoma is an aggressive disease resistant to
chemotherapy. recent clinical trials have reported improved survival for two
novel agents; ipilimumab, a humanized, igg1 monoclonal antibody that
blocks  xxxg544xxx  (ctla-4) and  xxxd3501xxx , a braf ( xxxg268xxx ) inhibitor
targeting an activating mutation in the serine-threonine-protein kinase
braf gene.
areas covered: the authors reviewed preclinical and clinical data examining
the safety of  xxxd3501xxx  in melanoma. medline and embase were
searched using the medical subject heading ‘ xxxd3501xxx ’ and the following
text terms: melanoma, braf inhibition,  xxxd3501xxx . this review provides the
reader with an overview of current data examining the efficacy and safety of
 xxxd3501xxx  in metastatic melanoma.
expert opinion:  xxxd3501xxx  is an oral agent licensed for patients with braf
v600e mutation-positive inoperable and metastatic melanoma. the most
common adverse effects observed in phase iii clinical trials were dermatological events, arthralgia and fatigue. specific dermatological toxicities
included development of cutaneous squamous cell cancers and keratoacanthomas. prolongation of the qt interval was also reported. regular dermatological assessments and electrocardiograms are recommended. ongoing trials
are examining  xxxd3501xxx  in both the adjuvant setting and metastatic setting in combination with ipilimumab and mek inhibitors (mitogen-activated
protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase). understanding and
overcoming mechanisms of resistance to braf inhibitors is the focus of
ongoing research.

introduction

it is estimated that 76,250 individuals will be diagnosed with melanoma and
9180 individuals will die from the disease in the usa during 2012 [1]. metastatic
melanoma is an aggressive disease with an increasing incidence and a death rate that
is rising at a higher rate than any other cancer type [2]. standard therapies used to treat
this disease have minimal activity and show little in terms of survival advantage. many
chemotherapeutic agents have been studied in patients with metastatic melanoma,
including  xxxd1796xxx  (dtic), nitrosoureas, platinum analogs, vinca alkaloids and
taxanes. of these, dtic has been the standard chemotherapeutic agent for melanoma
despite showing no survival advantage in clinical trials [3].
response rates observed with single-agent dtic are 15% or less and the associated median overall survival (os) is 6 -- 8 months [4]. in < 5% of cases, complete
responses have been reported [4]. temozolomide (tmz), an oral alkylating
agent with a broad spectrum of antitumor activity has also been evaluated in
metastatic melanoma. both tmz and dtic are prodrugs of the active alkylating

randomized phase iii trial (brim-3) comparing  xxxd3501xxx ,
960 mg orally twice daily with dtic chemotherapy

agent 5-(3-methyltriazenyl imidazole-4-carboximide (mtic).
unlike dtic, which requires metabolic activation, tmz
spontaneously converts to mtic under physiologic conditions with the main principle of tmz cytotoxicity exerted
through methylation of dna at the o6-position of
guanine [5-8]. a phase ii study of tmz in metastatic melanoma demonstrated response rates of 21% and a median
survival of 5.5 months [9]. a phase iii study which compared
tmz with dtic showed similar efficacy with a nonsignificant difference in median os of 7.7 months versus
6.4 months for tmz and dtic, respectively with similar
safety profile for both drugs [10].  xxxd2160xxx , a chloroethyl
nitosurea when compared with dtic had a significantly
improved response rate (15.2 vs 6.8%) but did not improve
os (7.3 vs 5.6 months, p = 0.067) [11]. the efficacy of an
extended schedule escalated dose of tmz was evaluated in
859 patients randomized to a dose of 150 mg/m2/day for
seven consecutive days every 2 weeks or dtic, administered
as intravenously at 1000 mg/m2/day on day 1 every 3 weeks.
no progression-free or os advantage was seen [12].
following these disappointing results, multiagent chemotherapy, such as the dartmouth regimen (dtic 220 mg/m2
and cisplatin 25 mg/m2 days 1 -- 3,  xxxd444xxx  150 mg/m2
day 1 every other cycle and tamoxifen 10 mg orally (twice
daily) was evaluated to determine if combination regimens
would lead to improved treatment options. unfortunately,
this did not prove superior to single-agent dtic chemotherapy in phase iii clinical studies [12-14]. the combination
of chemotherapy with biologic response modifiers increased
the response rate, but did not result in improved survival,
therefore biochemothearapy regimens cannot be regarded
as standard clinical practice, however biochemotherapy
continues to be evaluated in clinical trials [15].
despite decades of extensive clinical research, patients with
metastatic melanoma continued to have a poor prognostic
outlook with no agents showing a statistically significant

improvement in os in phase iii clinical trials [16]. the first
drug to demonstrate an improvement in os compared
with standard of care was ipilimumab. this drug is a fully
humanized, igg1 monoclonal antibody that blocks cytotoxic
t-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (ctla-4). it is a negative
regulator of t cells, and thereby augments t-cell activation
and proliferation [17-20]. ipilimumab had shown activity in
phase ii studies and has been examined in phase iii randomized controlled trials [21-23]. ipilimumab was compared
with a glycoprotein 100 vaccine ( xxxg1784xxx ) versus ipilimumab
plus  xxxg1784xxx . a median os of 10.0 months for the combination compared with 6.4 months for the  xxxg1784xxx  vaccine was
observed (hazard ratio (hr) for death, 0.68; p < 0.001).
median os with ipilimumab alone was 10.1 months (hr
for death in comparison with  xxxg1784xxx  alone, 0.66;
p = 0.003) [24]. ipilimumab was further evaluated in a clinical
trial in combination with chemotherapy in patients with
previously untreated metastatic melanoma [25]. ipilimumab
was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg in combination
with dtic, and compared with dtic plus placebo. an
improvement in os was seen for ipilimumab and dtic
(11.2 months) compared with dtic alone (9.1 months)
(hr for death, 0.72; p < 0.001).
 xxxd3501xxx  and the ras-raf-mek pathway
in metastatic melanoma

1.1

the ras-raf-mek-erk (rat-sarcoma (ras)-raf protooncogene serine/threonine protein kinase (raf)-mapk kinase
(mek)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk)) signaling
pathway has been extensively studied in melanoma (figure 1).
the protein kinase braf (v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene
homolog b1), encoded on chromosome 7q34, is a key component of the ras--raf cellular signaling pathway that regulates
cell proliferation and survival under the control of extracellular
growth factors and hormones. braf-gene kinase domain
mutations result in dysregulated downstream signaling via

mek and erk, causing excessive cell proliferation, and
survival independent of external cellular signals. the most
frequently mutated protein kinase in melanoma is braf
(40 -- 60%) [26]. it is estimated that 75 -- 90% of these mutations are a result of the substitution of  xxxd2431xxx  for valine
at codon 600 (braf v600e), although other activating mutations are known (e.g., braf v600k substituting lysine for
valine, which represents 5 -- 6% of mutations in braf
( xxxg889xxx  > aag), followed by braf v600r ( xxxg889xxx  > agg),
an infrequent two-nucleotide variation of the predominant
mutation and braf v600d ( xxxg889xxx  > gat) (table 1) [26-30].
in primary melanomas, the clinical and pathologic features
associated with mutant braf include younger age, fewer
markers of chronic sun damage (csd) in surrounding skin,
higher total body nevus counts and specific histopathologic
findings such as large epithelioid cytomorphology, heavy
melanization and prominent upward epidermal scatter of
melanocytes [31-34]. there were two orally administered molecules that were active and had highly selective activity against
braf mutation:  xxxd3501xxx  ( xxxd3501xxx ) (box 1) produced
by plexxikon (california, ca, usa) and developed by roche
(basel, switzerland) ( xxxd3501xxx ), and k2118436 developed
by glaxosmithkline (biochempartner). preclinical data
suggested activity of  xxxd3501xxx  in melanoma [35,36].
2.

mechanism of action of  xxxd3501xxx 

 xxxd3501xxx  has the chemical name propane-1-sulfonic acid
3-[5-(4-chlorophenyl)-lh-pyrrolo[,3-b]pyridine-3-carbonyl]2,4-difluoro-phenyl-amide. it has the molecular formula
 xxxd3501xxx . it is a potent oral inhibitor of mutated
braf [29] and has marked antitumor effects against melanoma cell lines with the braf v600e mutation but not
against cells with wild-type braf. preclinical studies showed

that  xxxd3501xxx  inhibits the kinase activity of braf with the
v600e mutation at low nanomolar concentrations, abrogates
signaling through the map kinase pathway and blocks proliferation of cells carrying braf with the v600e mutation
in vitro at high nanomolar concentrations. the mapk pathway controls many cellular functions such as cell proliferation
and survival. braf is a protein kinase within the ras-raf
signaling pathway. mutations of the braf gene, over 90%
of which are v600e, may result in activation of the braf
protein leading to uncontrolled proliferation and tumorigenesis.  xxxd3501xxx  binds to mutated braf including
v600e and renders it inactive; downstream signaling is
inhibited which potentially leads to apoptosis [37,38].
paradoxically, the mapk pathway can be upregulated by
braf inhibitors in cell lines that harbor wild-type braf
with either activating mutations of ras or mutations and
amplifications in receptor tyrosine kinases [39]. it has been
shown that drugs which selectively inhibit braf can drive
ras-dependent braf binding to craf leading to craf
activation and elevated mek-erk signaling. molecular
analysis of 21 tumor samples in cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas or keratoacanthomas, 60% of samples had ras
mutations, the most prevalent being hras q61l [40]. this
molecular mechanism could explain activation of the mapk
pathway in patients leading to the development of these cutaneous toxicities. this does not occur when oncogenic braf is
inhibited, signifying that braf inhibition does not drive
pathway activation and only occurs when braf is inhibited
in the presence of oncogenic ras [41]. some evidence suggests
that concominant use with a mek inhibitor can overcome
this paradoxical mapk activation [42].
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3501xxx 
following oral administration, the drug is well absorbed, with
a median tmax (maximal concentration) of about 3 h. tablets
are swallowed whole with water.  xxxd3501xxx  exhibits high
interpatient variability. in the phase ii study, (auc)0 -- 8 h
and cmax at day 1 were 22.1 ± 12.7 and 4.1 ± 2.3 µg/ml,
respectively. accumulation occurs on multiple twice-daily
dosing of  xxxd3501xxx . in the non-compartmental analysis,
after dosing with 960 mg  xxxd3501xxx  twice daily the day
15/day 1 ratio ranged from 15- to 17-fold for auc, and
13- to 14-fold for cmax, yielding auc0 -- 8 h and cmax of
380.2 ± 143.6 and 56.7 ± 21.8 µg/ml, respectively. the effect
of food on absorption of  xxxd3501xxx  is currently unknown.
variability in exposure may occur due to differences in gastrointestinal fluid content, volumes, ph, motility and transition
time and bile composition [43].
steady state is reached in approximately 15 -- 22 days.
 xxxd3501xxx  is highly protein-bound (> 99%) and is excreted
primarily via the feces (94%), with 1% excreted in urine.
elimination half-life is 57 h (range 30 -- 120 h). drug pharmacokinetics is not markedly changed in patients with mild
to moderate hepatic impairment but they have not been
studied in patients with severe dysfunction.  xxxd3501xxx

breast milk. limited data are available in patients with renal
impairment. a risk for increased exposure in patients with
severe renal impairment cannot be excluded; and patients
with severe renal impairment should be closely monitored [43].
phase i trial
a phase i trial with 55 patients; 49 of whom had melanoma
were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase, 32 additional
patients with metastatic melanoma who carried the braf
v600e mutation were enrolled in the extension phase involving the maximum dose that could be administered without
adverse effects (recommended phase ii dose). a starting dose
of 160 mg/day was generally well tolerated with no doselimiting toxicity until the 720 mg twice-daily dose level was
initiated. the recommended phase ii dose was 960 mg twice
daily, with increases in dose limited by grade 2 or 3 rash,
fatigue and arthralgia. sixteen patients were among the dose
escalation cohort with melanoma whose tumors carried
the v600e braf mutation and who received 240 mg or
more of  xxxd3501xxx  twice daily, 10 experienced a partial
response (pr) and 1 patient had a complete response (cr).
of the 32 patients in the extension cohort, 24 had a pr and
2 had a cr. dose-limiting toxic effects were observed when
a dose of 720 mg was given, 41% of patients required a
dose reduction (10 patients to 720 mg twice daily, 1 patient
to 600 mg twice daily and to 480 mg twice daily in 2 patients).
estimated median progression-free survival (pfs) among all
patients was more than 7 months [44].
2.1.1

phase ii trial
unprecedented findings were reported in a phase ii trial which
studied  xxxd3501xxx  in patients with braf v600 mutations
who had previously received treatment for metastatic melanoma.
there were 132 patients enrolled and they received  xxxd3501xxx 
at a dose of 960 mg orally twice daily (until development of
unacceptable toxic effects or disease progression). dose reductions were seen in 42% of patients, most commonly for rash,
arthralgia and liver function test (lft) abnormalities. the
response rate was 53%, and the median duration of response
was 6.7 months and median os was 15.9 months [45,46].

phase iii clinical trial
the efficacy of  xxxd3501xxx  was examined in a phase iii
randomized controlled trial (brim-3) that compared  xxxd3501xxx , 960 mg orally twice daily with dtic chemotherapy
(1000 mg/m2 administered every 3 weeks) in treatmentnaı̈ve patients with metastatic melanoma. pfs and os were
co-primary end points in the study. a total of 675 patients
with unresectable, previously untreated stage iiic or stage
iv metastatic braf v600e mutation-positive melanoma
were included. response rates were 48% for  xxxd3501xxx 
and 5% for dtic (47%). the study showed a relative reduction of 63% in the risk of death and of 74% in the risk of
tumor progression (p < 0.001). after a longer follow-up,
median os for the  xxxd3501xxx  arm was 13.2 months compared with 9.6 months in the dtic arm [47] (hr 0.67,
p = 0.0003). updated brim-3 phase iii data were presented
recently which continued to demonstrate superiority of
 xxxd3501xxx  as compared with dtic. pfs was 6.9 versus
1.6 months favoring  xxxd3501xxx  (hr 0.38, p < 0.001).
median os also favored  xxxd3501xxx  at 13.6 versus
9.7 months (hr 0.7, p < 0.001) [48].of note,  xxxd1795xxx  a
second braf agent after showing promise in phase i and
phase ii trials, was evaluated in the phase iii setting compared
with dtic [49]. patients were randomly assigned to receive
either  xxxd1795xxx  (187 patients) or dtic (63 patients) in previously untreated, stage iv or unresectable stage iii braf
v600e mutation-positive melanoma. median pfs was
5·1 months for  xxxd1795xxx  and 2·7 months for dtic, with
a hr of 0·30 (95% confidence interval (ci) 0·18 -- 0·51;
p < 0·0001).

dermatological
dermatological side effects including photosensitivity reactions,
alopecia, pruritus, hyperkeratosis, maculopapular rash, dry skin,
actinic keratosis, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome,
keratosis pilaris, erythema nodosum, stevens--johnson syndrome and new primary melanoma development have been
reported [50,51]. keratoacanthomas grade 2 (2%) and grade 3
(6%) occurred in the phase iii study [47].  xxxd3501xxx -related
photoxicity is uva-dependent. this method is compatible
with reports of sunburns after ultraviolet exposure through glass
while driving a car as uva in contrast to uvb can penetrate
glass. this is important information and other specific uva
characteristics such as constant intensity regardless of daylight
and season should be communicated to patients commencing
therapy with  xxxd3501xxx . practical advice given to patients
includes avoiding sunlight while taking the drug. when going
outdoors, clothes that protect the skin, including the face,
head, hands, arms and legs should be worn and broad-spectrum
sunscreen which eliminates uva induced photoxicity and lip
balm with an spf of at least 30 are recommended [52].

treatment but caused in part by pro-proliferative interaction
between braf inhibitors and latent ras mutations present
in keratinocytes. the concept that a targeted treatment that
blocks one specific pathway and may promote tumorigenesis
in another, is concerning.
further evidence that braf inhibitors may induce carcinogenesis or promote tumor progression via stimulation of
mapk signaling in raf wild-type cells is the proposition that
 xxxd3501xxx  may induce atypical melanocytic proliferation.
twenty-two cutaneous melanocytic lesions that had either
developed or changed considerably in morphology in 19 patients
undergoing treatment were evaluated in those receiving braf
inhibitors. there were 12 newly detected primary melanomas
confirmed in 11 patients within 27 weeks of braf inhibition.
in 10 nevi that developed, 9 were dysplastic. all melanocytic
lesions were braf wild type. this suggests that braf inhibitors may induce tumorigenesis and malignant melanocytic
development [58]. patients on  xxxd3501xxx  therefore should be
closely monitored for development of cutaneous lesions and
suspicious lesions referred to dermatology.

secondary malignancy
cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas occurred in 12% of
patients treated with  xxxd3501xxx  (40/336) in the phase iii
clinical trial [47]. a total of 18% of patients were reported to
have at least one squamous cell carcinoma of the skin
or keratoacanthoma.
cutaneous squamous cell cancer and keratoacanthomas were
observed in patients treated with sorafenib, another agent with
 xxxg1924xxx  inhibitory activity [53,54]. the mechanism by which
induction of cutaneous neoplasia develops may involve the
effect of  xxxd3501xxx  on cells in which wild-type braf is
primed by ras mutations which paradoxically leads to
mapk pathway activation [39-41,55,56]. squamous cell cancers
that arise in patients receiving braf inhibitors are enriched
with ras mutations when compared with those from an
untreated population [57]. this suggests that formation of this
tumor subtype is not due to a direct event of braf inhibitor

3.4

3.2

gastrointestinal
grade 2 diarrhea occurred in 5% of patients and grade
3 events occurred in < 1% of patients receiving  xxxd3501xxx 
in the phase iii study [47]. vomiting occurred in patients
receiving  xxxd3501xxx , with 3% having grade 2 events and
1% having grade 3 events.
general
grade 2 fatigue occurred in 11% of patients and grade 3 fatigue
occurred in 2% of those receiving  xxxd3501xxx  in the phase iii
trial [47]. monitoring of liver function should be performed
before initiation of treatment and monthly during treatment
and as clinically indicated while taking  xxxd3501xxx .
3.5

cardiovascular
 xxxd3501xxx  can prolong the qt interval which may
result in serious arrythmias such as torsades de pointes.

electrocardiograms (ecg) and electrolytes, including potassium, magnesium and calcium, should be monitored before
treatment with  xxxd3501xxx  [59]. monitoring with ecgs
should occur 15 days after treatment initiation and then
monthly during the first 3 months of treatment, followed by
every 3 months thereafter or more often as clinically indicated. initiation of vermurafenib therapy is not recommended
in patients with a qtc interval ‡ 500 ms. if during treatment
the qtc exceeds 500 ms (common terminology criteria for
adverse events (ctc-ae) > grade 3),  xxxd3501xxx  should be
interrupted temporarily, electrolyte abnormalities corrected
and cardiac risk factors for qt prolongation controlled.
re-initiation of treatment should occur at a lower dose once
the qtc decreases below 500 ms. permanent discontinuation
is recommended if after correction of associated risk factors,
the qtc increase meets values of both > 500 and > 60 ms
change from pretreatment values [59]. to date, there are no
clinical adverse event reports attributable to qtc interval
prolongation, manifest cardiac arrhythmia or other clinically
significant cardiac events in clinical trials. however, qtc
prolongation was observed in the ecg substudy of the
phase ii trial [45].
ophthalmic
uveitis has been reported in patients treated with  xxxd3501xxx 
therapy. treatment with steroid and mydriatic ophthalmic
drops may be required. patients should be routinely monitored
for signs and symptoms of uveitis [59].
3.7

interaction with other drugs
results from in vivo drug--drug interaction study in patients
with cancer demonstrated that  xxxd3501xxx  is a moderate
cyp1a2 inhibitor, a weak cyp2d6 inhibitor and a cyp3a4
inducer. coadministration of  xxxd3501xxx  resulted in an
increase in auc of  xxxd990xxx  (cyp2c9 substrate). caution
and careful international normalized ratio (inr) monitoring
is recommended when  xxxd3501xxx  is used concomitantly
with warfarin.  xxxd3501xxx  is a substrate of cyp3a4,
and therefore, concomitant administration of strong cyp3a4
inhibitors or inducers may alter the concentration of
 xxxd3501xxx  [59].
in comparison with  xxxd3501xxx , toxicities seen with
 xxxd1795xxx  were again related to skin. photosensitivity was
rarely seen with  xxxd1795xxx  in the phase iii trial and
grade 2 or higher proliferative epidermal skin lesions were
observed in less than 10% of patients treated [49]. cutaneous
squamous cell cancers or keratoacanthomas were observed
in 6% of patients and 28% of patients required dose
modifications [49].
3.8

4. development of resistance to braf
inhibitors

despite high initial response rates in patients with v600 mutationpositive metastatic melanoma treated with  xxxd3501xxx ,
2538

disease progression tends to manifest relatively quickly in
many patients. an important focus of research is identifying
mechanisms of resistance and ways to overcome it include
profiling epigene expression of melanoma cell lines [60]. resistance can occur through both mapk-dependant and -independent mechanisms. one method of resistance is through
activation of other pathways that causes the tumor cell to
become less dependent on erk signaling. in cell lines
studied, overexpression of  xxxg1710xxx  (platelet-derived growth
factor receptor beta) was associated with resistance to
the antiproliferative effects of braf inhibition [61]. other
methods that confers resistance to braf inhibition include
overexpression of raf1 and mutations in  xxxg1605xxx  [62,63].
although secondary acquired mutations in braf have not
yet been identified, several alterations leading to reactivation
of oncogenic signaling through the mapk pathway result in
acquired resistance to braf inhibitors. changes in braf
can occur including amplifications and truncations in braf
through alternate splicing, leading to increased kinase activity
due to increased dimerization [64,65].
different methods to overcome this resistance are being
evaluated. preclinical evaluation of histone deacetylase inhibitors suggest that these compounds can partially overcome
resistance by inducing increased apoptosis through upregulation of caspases and bim [66]. in clinical trials, the combination of a braf inhibitor and a mek inhibitor may
prevent the development of mapk-driven acquired resistance
mechanisms. the combination of  xxxd1795xxx  and the mek
inhibitor  xxxd3408xxx  has been evaluated with promising
results [67,68]. indeed,  xxxd3408xxx  alone as compared with
dtic led to an improved median pfs of 4.8 months in
the  xxxd3408xxx  group compared with 1.5 months with
dtic [69]. at 6 months, os was 81% in the  xxxd3408xxx  group
and 67% in the chemotherapy group despite crossover (hr
for death, 0.54; 95% ci 0.32 -- 0.92; p = 0.01). secondary
skin neoplasms were not seen, most common adverse effects
were rash, diarrhea and peripheral edema [69].
ongoing studies with  xxxd3501xxx  in melanoma
(adjuvant and metastatic disease)

4.1

 xxxd3501xxx  is currently being tested in other clinical
settings, such as those patients with poor performance status
and in patients with non-v600e mutant metastatic melanoma (nct01474551 and nct01586195) and a study in
pediatric patients is planned (nct015193232). the role of
mapk pathway restoration in resistance to  xxxd3501xxx  and
the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma provides a rationale for combination therapy with braf and a
downstream mek inhibitor.  xxxd1795xxx  (gsk21118436), a
selective braf inhibitor, has been combined with the mek
inhibitor,  xxxd3408xxx  ( xxxd3408xxx ) in a phase i/ii trial,
with preliminary evidence of antitumor efficacy and safety [36]
and phase iii evaluation is underway. updated results demonstrated a median pfs in patients who received the combination of both therapeutic agents was 7.4 months, although

pfs was 10.8 months in patients who received a specific dose
of 150 mg of  xxxd1795xxx  twice daily and 2 mg of  xxxd3408xxx 
once daily. the overall response rate (orr) for that study
was 56% [70]. of note, the rate of skin rash was substantially
lower than that observed in the trials of  xxxd3501xxx , and
no patient in this cohort to date has developed a squamous
cell carcinoma (table 3).
combination strategies, such as  xxxd3501xxx  and an
 xxxg1145xxx  inhibitor or an akt inhibitor may also provide a
means by which to overcome clinical resistance. a trial of
 xxxd3501xxx  combined with the novel immunotherapy agent
ipilimumab is already underway (nct01400451) [71]. the
brim-7 trial, a phase ib study is evaluating  xxxd3501xxx  in
combination with  xxxd1735xxx  in patients with braf
v600e-positive metastatic melanoma who have progressed
after treatment with  xxxd3501xxx  alone.  xxxd1735xxx  is a
potent selective inhibitor of  xxxg1361xxx /2 [71]. this trial may
answer the possible additive or possible synergistic effects of
these agents and provide an attempt at reducing dermatological toxicities that accompany the stimulation of the mek
pathway when braf inhibitors are used as single agents.
 xxxd3501xxx  in v600e mutation-positive early melanoma is
being studied in an adjuvant trial and will provide important
information at an early possible curable stage of disease and
will be an important study.

expert opinion

therapeutic options for melanoma have provided frustratingly disappointing results in the past but we are now

entering a new era where new drugs are providing some
hope to patients with this disease.  xxxd3501xxx  is a targeted
agent developed for the treatment of patients with v600e
mutation-positive metastatic melanoma. improved response
rates, pfs and importantly os have been reported in clinical
trials comparing verumurafenib with the previous ‘gold
standard’ dtic.
unlike ipilimumab which has also showed a survival advantage in metastatic melanoma compared with standard of care,
a predictive biomarker, that is, v600e mutation has been
identified for  xxxd3501xxx  which allows selection of a subgroup likely to derive most benefit from the agent. clinicians
are currently trying to determine how best to sequence these
agents in patients with braf mutation-positive metastatic
melanoma. how best to use both these agents in braf
mutation-positive melanoma is a conundrum for clinicians
presently as there are limited data available. it has been proposed that  xxxd3501xxx  could be reserved for symptomatic
braf mutation-positive patients with high burden disease
and where a rapid response to treatment is required.
ipilimumab when it induces a response it tends to occur at
a slower rate action and therefore may be best reserved for
those with asymptomatic disease. sequential therapy or concurrent combination therapy represents another option and
may work but this is not yet clear.
evaluation on a small number of braf mutation-positive
patients tried to seek factors that could identify which patients
would be at higher risk of disease progression on relapse
with a braf inhibitor and therefore may not have time to
complete treatment with ipilimumab [72]. in 34 eligible

patients, 6 received ipilimumab followed by a braf inhibitor
( xxxd3501xxx  or  xxxd1795xxx ) and 28 patients treated with a
braf inhibitor who subsequently received ipilimumab. of
the 28 patients, 12 (43 %) were unable to complete ipilimumab treatment and had rapid disease progression resulting
in death.
for patients with rapid progression median os was significantly shorter at 5.7 months (95% ci 5.0 -- 6.3), compared
with 18.6 months (95% ci 3.2 -- 41.3; p < 0.0001) in
patients who were able to complete ipilimumab treatment.
factors associated with rapid progression included elevated
lactate dehydrogenase, performance status of 1 and presence
of brain metastases (bm). at least two of these risk factors
at baseline were linked to rapid disease progression. therefore, this patient subgroup may benefit from ipilimumab as
first-line therapy.
bm are detected in up to 10% of patients with melanoma
during their disease and at autopsy up to 73% of patients
who died from disseminated cutaneous melanoma have
bm. bm in melanoma are third frequent in terms of bm,
after lung and renal cell cancers [73,74]. unfortunately, this
patient subgroup is often excluded from clinical trials.
favorable preliminary data with braf inhibitors for the
treatment of patients with bm have been observed [75] and
in a phase ii trial involving 172 patients, some of which
had received prior brain therapy, and others had experienced
progression following prior brain therapy, overall intracranial response rate was 53% in the patients with v600e
mutations providing hope for those affected by bm in
melanoma [76].

resistance mechanisms in  xxxd3501xxx  are extremely
important and data indicate that the mapk pathway along
with the appearance of concomitant  xxxg1605xxx  and mek
mutations are involved. methods to overcome this through
combination of mek inhibitors with braf inhibitors are
promising [77].  xxxd3501xxx  has been evaluated against
braf v600e mutation-positive melanomas but efficacy in
inhibiting the v600k mutated form has also been proposed.
 xxxd3501xxx  has also shown potential in vitro in primary
and metastatic melanoma cell inhibiting braf v600k activity [78]. clinical activity of  xxxd3501xxx  in patients with
documented v600k mutation-positive suggests that these
patients may also be eligible for  xxxd3501xxx  [79].  xxxd1795xxx 
was given in 16 patients who had braf v600k mutations in
the phase ii study, with an orr of 13% and a pfs of
9.7 weeks, suggesting activity in this subgroup [80].  xxxd3408xxx , a mek inhibitor, as compared with dtic, improved
pfs and os among patients with braf v600e or v600k
mutation metastatic melanoma providing those with v600k
mutations further treatment options [69]. ongoing studies
will help define how to maximize the use of novel therapies
in melanoma and will also provide important toxicity data
so patients can receive the most efficacious regimens safely
but recent times have provided much needed hope in this
aggressive disease.
