abstract

introduction

preeclampsia, which complicates 3–8% of pregnancies, is
one of the leading causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality.
its pathophysiology remains unclear. the aim of the present
study was to investigate the presence and the role of b2- and
b3-adrenergic receptors ( xxxg92xxx  and  xxxg93xxx , respectively) in
human placental arteries and to assess the influence of
preeclampsia on adrb responsiveness. sr 59119a, salbutamol,
and  xxxd2401xxx  ( xxxg93xxx ,  xxxg92xxx , and nonselective adrb
agonists, respectively) induced a concentration-dependent relaxation of placental artery rings obtained from women with
uncomplicated or preeclamptic pregnancies. sr 59119a-induced relaxation was unaffected by the blockade of  xxxg91xxx 
and  xxxg92xxx  by 0.1 lm propranolol but was significantly
decreased by the blockade of  xxxg91xxx ,  xxxg92xxx , and  xxxg93xxx  by
10 lm propranolol. both sr 59119a and salbutamol were
associated with a significant increase in camp production that
was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with 0.1 lm
propranolol only for salbutamol. sr 59119a-induced relaxation
(emax ¼ 28% 6 5% vs. 45% 6 4%, respectively) and camp
production (2.7 6 0.5 vs. 4.9 6 0.4 pmol/mg of protein,
respectively; p , 0.01) were decreased in arteries obtained
from preeclamptic compared to normotensive women. both
 xxxg92xxx  and  xxxg93xxx  transcripts were expressed at the same
level between arteries from normotensive and preeclamptic
women. western blot analysis, however, revealed a decreased
expression of the  xxxg93xxx  immunoreactive protein in arteries
from preeclamptic compared to normotensive women. we
suggest the presence of functional  xxxg92xxx  and  xxxg93xxx  in
human placental arteries. even if preeclampsia is associated
with an impairment of the  xxxg93xxx  responsiveness,  xxxg93xxx 
agonists may have future pharmaceutical implications in the
management of pregnancy-related disorders.

preeclampsia, which complicates 3–8% of pregnancies, is
one of the leading causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality
and is responsible for one-third of maternal deaths [1]. several
studies have suggested that women who develop preeclampsia
are at increased risk of cardiovascular complications [2]. the
mechanisms responsible for this pathology are still unclear. it is
characterized by abnormal vascular response to placentation
associated with increased systemic vascular resistance, enhanced platelet aggregation, activation of the coagulation
system, and endothelial cell dysfunction [3]. the initiating
event of preeclampsia seems to be the reduction of uteroplacental perfusion associated with an endothelial activation,
which leads to enhanced formation of  xxxg674xxx  and
thromboxane a2, decreased synthesis of vasodilatators (e.g.,
 xxxd2738xxx  [no]), and finally, to maternal hypertension [4].
furthermore, it has been suggested that fetoplacental resistances are increased during preeclampsia [5]. among the multiple
theories regarding the pathophysiology of preeclampsia (for
review, see sibai et al. [6]), it recently was speculated that an
imbalance of pro- and antiangiogenic factors may lead to
preeclampsia [7, 8]. trophoblasts have the capacity to secrete
catecholamines, and high venous blood concentrations of
noradrenaline were found in preeclamptic pregnancies [9]. it
can be postulated (even if not unanimously accepted [10]) that
the high levels of catecholamines found in the plasma of
women with preeclampsia might be of placental origin, in
response to trophoblast tissue ischemia from preeclampsia, and
secreted as a physiological signal to increase maternal blood
flow to the fetoplacental unit. little is known, however, about
the role of the b-adrenergic receptor (adrb) during preeclampsia. aune et al. [10] have shown, using a human
mononuclear leukocytes model, that the number of functional
 xxxg92xxx  is reduced in preeclampsia without increased plasma
catecholamine levels, suggesting that the reduction of  xxxg92xxx 
could be one of the factors implicated in the increase of
peripheral vascular resistances.
although the adrbs originally were subclassified into
 xxxg91xxx  and  xxxg92xxx , another subtype, the b3 subtype, has
been reported [11]. the  xxxg93xxx  shares 40–50% amino acid
sequence identity with  xxxg91xxx  and  xxxg92xxx  [12], and it lacks
recognition sites for the camp-dependent protein kinase and
adrb kinase implicated in the desensitization of  xxxg92xxx 
[13]. the  xxxg93xxx  has been shown to mediate lipolysis in white
adipose tissue and thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue [14],
to inhibit the contractile activity of colon [15], and to inhibit in

catecholamines, cyclic  xxxd81xxx , cyclic
 xxxd1067xxx , placenta, pregnancy

rouget et al.

vitro contraction of human near-term or nonpregnant myometrium [16, 17].
the vasorelaxant effect of  xxxg93xxx  agonists has been
demonstrated in several animal models. for example, berlan et
al. [18] demonstrated that  xxxg93xxx  is present in dog cutaneous
microvessels and that its in vivo stimulation by selective
agonists induces vasorelaxation, as suggested by the increase
of cutaneous blood flow. the vasorelaxant effect of the
 xxxg93xxx  agonists was described in rat thoracic aorta [19]. on
the other hand, little is known about the presence and role of
 xxxg93xxx  in the human cardiovascular system. furthermore,
transduction mechanisms of this receptor are still misunderstood. classically, the  xxxg93xxx  is coupled to gs protein and
stimulates the adenylyl cyclase/camp pathway [20], as is the
case in human myometrium [16, 17, 21]. nevertheless,
gauthier et al. [22] in human heart and trochu et al. [19] in
rat thoracic aorta have shown that  xxxg93xxx  agonists act through
a no synthase pathway, leading to an increase in cgmp level.
to our knowledge, the presence of the  xxxg92xxx  and
 xxxg93xxx  in human placental arteries has not been described
convincingly, even if it was recently suggested that  xxxg93xxx 
might be present in human umbilical arteries [23]. we,
therefore, investigated the presence and function of  xxxg92xxx 
and  xxxg93xxx  in human placental arteries and assessed the
influence of preeclampsia on their expression and function
using complementary functional, biochemical, and molecular
approaches.
materials and methods
preparation of human placental arteries
placental arteries were dissected from the chorionic plate of placentae
obtained from women with uncomplicated (n ¼ 45) or preeclamptic (n ¼ 18)
pregnancies at term (mean gestation, 38.5 6 0.31 and 37.6 6 1.26 wk for
normotensive and preeclamptic pregnancies, respectively), immediately after
vaginal delivery or cesarean section. the diagnostic criteria used to select
preeclamptic women for the present study were as follows: new-onset
hypertension was defined as a blood pressure of at least 140 mm hg (systolic)
or at least 90 mm hg (diastolic) on at least two occasions and at least 4–6 h
apart after the 20th week of gestation in women known to be normotensive
beforehand, and proteinuria was defined as excretion of 300 mg or more of
protein every 24 h. if 24-h urine samples are not available, proteinuria is
defined as a protein concentration of 300 mg/l or more (1 on dipstick) in at
least two random urine samples taken at least 4–6 h apart [6]. no significant
difference was observed in vasoreactivity of arteries obtained from vaginal
delivery or cesarean section. among women with preeclampsia, one received
a treatment with intravenous  xxxd2718xxx  (a calcium-channel antagonist) and
another with  xxxd2534xxx . none of the patients had been treated with
 xxxg92xxx  agonist before delivery. placental arteries were placed immediately in
ice-cold krebs solution (116 mm nacl, 5.4 mm kcl, 1.8 mm cacl2, 0.6 mm
kh2po4, 0.8 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 19 mm nahco3, 5.5 mm glucose, and 0.1 mm lascorbic acid; 48c) and transported to the laboratory to be used fresh
(functional and biochemical studies) or quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen before
being stored at 808c until use (molecular biology and western blot
experiments). the use of human placental arteries for experiments was
approved by the local ethical committee.

functional study
arteries were cut into rings (length, 5 mm; diameter, 1–2 mm) and were
suspended isometrically between two stainless-steel hooks under an optimal
resting tension of 3 g [5] in a 10-ml organ bath containing krebs solution
(composition as described above) at 378c and continuously gassed with
a mixture of 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide (ph 7.40). the arterial
rings were attached to a force-displacement transducer connected to an
amplifier (emka) to record tension changes by a graphics software iox
(emka). after 1 h, during which the arterial rings were washed every 15
min and the resting tension readjusted to 3 g, the tissues were allowed to
equilibrate for 30 min before being challenged with 80 mm potassium
chloride to evaluate their functional integrity. arteries were then washed three
times at 15-min intervals and then allowed to equilibrate for a further 30 min.

after recovery, arterial rings were contracted with 10 nm u 46619,
a thromboxane a2 analog. when the developed tension had reached a plateau,
cumulative concentration-response curves (crcs; 0.001–10 lm) were
constructed for  xxxd2401xxx  (a nonselective adrb agonist), salbutamol (an
 xxxg92xxx  agonist), and sr 59119a (an  xxxg93xxx  agonist). each following
concentration was added to the bath when a plateau of relaxation was reached
(;20 min). one additional paired ring was used as a control for any timerelated change in the tension throughout the experimental procedure. a second
set of experiments was performed during which crcs were constructed after
a 30-min incubation with propranolol at 0.1 lm to block  xxxg91xxx  and  xxxg92xxx 
or  xxxd1891xxx  lm to block  xxxg91xxx ,  xxxg92xxx , and  xxxg93xxx  [24] or with l-nna (n-xnitro-l-arginine methyl ester, 100 lm) to block no synthase. finally, to assess
the role of endothelium in the effects of sr 59119a, a third set of experiments
was performed in which the relaxing properties of sr 59119a were assessed in
a paired fashion in endothelium-intact or endothelium-denuded placental artery
rings. endothelium was denuded mechanically. the emax value indicates the
maximal relaxation obtained at the maximal concentration tested (10 lm) for
each adrb agonist and is expressed as a percentage of the maximal relaxation
obtained with 0.1 mm papaverine added to the bath at the end of each
experiment. the ec50 values indicate the concentration producing 50% of
maximal relaxation induced by each drug and are calculated using the
graphpad prism 4.01 computer program (graphpad software). for analysis,
ec50 values were log-transformed and expressed as log ec50.

biochemical study
arterial rings were equilibrated in krebs solution (composition as described
above) continuously gassed with a mixture of 95% oxygen and 5% carbon
dioxide at 378c (ph 7.40) for 40 min and then exposed to 0.1 lm propranolol
to block  xxxg91xxx  and  xxxg92xxx  [24] or its saline vehicle for 30 min, followed by
addition of adrb agonists (salbutamol or sr 59119a; both 10 lm) for 5 min.
in paired arterial rings, time-matched experiments were carried out for a total
incubation period of 65 min to determine the basal cyclic nucleotide content of
nonstimulated tissues. at the end of the incubation period, the tissues were
processed as described previously [21]. arterial rings were frozen immediately
in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. the
homogenate was centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx  000 3 g for 15 min at 48c. the ph of the
supernatant was neutralized by the addition of excess calcium carbonate
followed by low-speed centrifugation. aliquots of the supernatant were tested
for camp and cgmp by enzyme immunoassay kits (rpn 225 and rpn 226,
respectively; amersham pharmacia biotech ltd.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

analysis of  xxxg92xxx  and  xxxg93xxx  transcripts by rt-pcr
as described previously [17, 21, 25], extraction of total rna from
placental arteries using the trizol reagent method, rt using moloney murine
leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, and pcr reactions using taq dna
polymerase were performed under the conditions recommended by the
manufacturer (life technologies).
the design of primers for each adrb (invitrogen custom primers) and
experimental procedures were exactly as described in previous reports [17, 21].
briefly, the amplification profile for  xxxg92xxx  and  xxxg93xxx  transcripts consisted
in denaturation at 948c for 1 min, annealing at 648c for 1 min, and extension at
728c for 1 min, with a final extension at 728c for 10 min. as a positive control
for the assay, reverse-transcribed  xxxg92xxx  and  xxxg93xxx  mrnas were amplified
by pcr in human myometrium, which is known to express these receptors [17,
21, 26]. we controlled so that pcr products without previous reverse
transcriptase did not reveal any positive band.
for semiquantification, the intensities of the bands on polaroid pictures of
the ethidium bromide staining gel were analyzed densitometrically using the
image-analyzer gel doc 1000 system (bio-rad). results are expressed as
relative levels (arbitrary densitometric units [adu]) of specific mrna
normalized to b2-microglobulin mrna in each sample.

western blot analysis
western blot experiments were performed following the same experimental
procedure as reported previously [17]. briefly, snap-frozen placental arteries
obtained from normotensive and hypertensive pregnancies were homogenized
with ultra-turrax in homogenization buffer. after an initial centrifugation (500
3 g for 15 min at 48c), the supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 48 000 3
g for 20 min at 48c. the resulting pellet was suspended in solubilization buffer
overnight at 48c. a further centrifugation was performed at 48 000 3 g for 20
min at 48c. total protein content was determined by the bradford method with
bsa as standard. samples (50 lg of protein by lane) were dissolved in laemmli

adrb in human placental arteries
buffer (43) and boiled for 5 min before electrophoresis on a 10% sds-page.
then, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. blots were
blocked for 1 h in 10% nonfat dried milk powder in tbst (10 mm tris, 150 mm
nacl, and 0.1% tween 20; ph 7.8) at room temperature. blocked membranes
were washed three times with tbst. the blots were then incubated overnight at
48c with a 1:500 dilution of primary  xxxg93xxx  polyclonal antibody (ab5122;
chemicon international) in 1% nonfat dried milk powder in tbst. after three
washes with tbst, the blots were incubated for 45 min with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit igg whole antibody (na 934; amersham) at
a dilution of 1:5000 at room temperature and washed 5 times with tbst.
immunoreactive proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (ecl detection
reagents; rpn2105; amersham pharmacia biotech). the intensities of the bands
were analyzed densitometrically by the nih software package and expressed in
adus as the mean 6 sem. the specificity of each immunoreactive band was
assessed by specific blocking in the presence of the antigenic peptide against
which the antibody has been raised (ag388; chemicon international). for
preabsorption, a mixture of the primary antibody with its respective antigen (1:5)
was incubated under mild agitation in a small volume of pbs buffer for 24 h at
48c. in addition, homogenate of chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells transfected
with the human  xxxg93xxx  (graciously provided by dr. p. marini from sanofiaventis research center, milan, italy) was used as positive control.

histological evaluation of placental arteries
to compare morphology of placental arteries and to assess endothelial
integrity (agents inducing endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation [e.g., acetylcholine,  xxxd80xxx , and bradykinin] usually fail to relax placental
arteries [27]), histological evaluation of arteries was performed at the end of
experiments (standard coloration by hematoxylin-eosin-safran and immunostaining using a monoclonal antibody against  xxxg1724xxx  [dako]).

drugs and solutions
the drugs and chemicals used and their sources were as follows: sr
59119a (n-[(7-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthahlen-(2r)-2-yl)methyl](2r)-2-hydroxy-2-(3-chlorophenyl)
ethanamine hydrochloride; a gift from sanofi-aventis research center, milan,
italy), and u-46619 (9,11-dideoxy-11a,9a-epoxymethano-prostaglandin f2a),
l-nna, serotonin, papaverine, salbutamol,  xxxd2401xxx , and propranolol
(sigma-aldrich chimie). sr 59119a was dissolved in a mixture of absolute
ethanol (30%),  xxxd1896xxx  (2%), and distilled water for the 10 lm
solution and, thereafter, diluted in distilled water, whereas all other drugs were
dissolved in distilled water. drug concentrations are given as final bath
concentrations.

results
functional study
sr 59119a, salbutamol, and  xxxd2401xxx  induced a concentration-dependent relaxation of u46619-contracted placental artery rings obtained from women with uncomplicated
pregnancy (fig. 1a). the maximal effect obtained for 10 lm
sr 59119a was significantly (p , 0.01) higher than that
obtained for  xxxd2401xxx  and salbutamol at the same maximal
concentration (10 lm) (table 1). the log ec50 value for sr
59119a was not significantly superior to that of salbutamol
and  xxxd2401xxx  (table 1). the relaxing properties of sr
59119a was not significantly reduced in endothelium-denuded
compared with endothelium-intact placental artery rings (emax,
45% 6 3% vs. 39% 6 3%, respectively; log ec50, 7.1 6
0.30 vs. 6.89 6 0.29, respectively) (fig. 1b).
the sr 59119a crc was significantly (p , 0.001)
downward-shifted after the blockade of  xxxg91xxx ,  xxxg92xxx , and
 xxxg93xxx  with 10 lm propranolol but was unaffected by the
blockade of  xxxg91xxx  and  xxxg92xxx  with 0.1 lm propranolol
pretreatment (fig. 2a and table 2).
the blockade of no synthase by 100 lm l-nna did not
modify the crc for sr 59119a (emax, 45% 6 4% vs. 39% 6
3%, respectively; log ec50, 6.81 6 0.21 vs. 6.62 6 0.23,
respectively) in experiments performed with or without l-nna
(fig. 2b).
compared with arteries from normotensive women, the
crc for sr 59119a was downward-shifted (anova, p ,
0.05) in arteries obtained from preeclamptic women, with
a significant reduction of maximal relaxation (emax, 48% 6
4% vs. 28 6 4% for 0.1 lm sr 59119a in arteries obtained
from normotensive and preeclamptic women, respectively),
whereas salbutamol- and  xxxd2401xxx -induced relaxations
were not significantly different in both types of arteries (fig.
3).

statistical analysis

cyclic nucleotides levels after stimulation with salbutamol
and sr 59119a

in the functional experiments, differences among groups were determined
by anova and expressed with a t-test using the bonferroni correction.
differences in potencies and maximal effects, as well as differences among
groups in biochemical experiments, were determined by student t-test for
unpaired data or anova as appropriate. all differences were considered to be
significant at p , 0.05.

sr 59119a and salbutamol (both 10 lm) induced
a significant (p , 0.01) and similar increase in camp
production compared to the basal value (fig. 4 and table 3),
whereas they did not modify the cgmp level (data not shown).
sr 59119a-induced camp production was not altered after

preeclampsia was associated with a significant impairment

analysis of  xxxg92xxx  and  xxxg93xxx  transcripts
using an rt-pcr method, we analyzed the expression of
 xxxg92xxx  and  xxxg93xxx  transcripts in placental arteries obtained
from normotensive and preeclamptic women. both  xxxg92xxx  and
 xxxg93xxx  mrna expression was detected (417- and 368-bp
fragments, respectively) in human placental arteries (fig. 6a)
and myometrium. preeclampsia did not influence the level of
expression of  xxxg92xxx  and  xxxg93xxx  transcripts (fig. 6b).
expression of  xxxg93xxx  immunoreactive protein
to characterize further the alteration of the  xxxg93xxx  function
revealed in our functional study, we compared the expression
of the  xxxg93xxx  immunoreactive protein in placental arteries
from normotensive and preeclamptic women (fig. 7a).
western blot analysis of plasma membranes prepared from
arteries obtained from normotensive and preeclamptic pregnancies revealed a 68-kda band [17], which disappeared in the
presence of the corresponding blocking peptide (data not
shown). as a positive control, a 68-kda band was detected

with a homogenate of cho cells transfected with the human
 xxxg93xxx  that also was specifically blocked by the antigenic
peptide. densitometric immunoblot analysis indicated a decreased intensity of the signal for  xxxg93xxx  in the placental
arteries from preeclamptic compared to normotensive women
(fig. 7b).
histological evaluation of placental arteries
histological analysis of placental arteries revealed no
histological difference between arteries obtained from normotensive and preeclamptic women (data not shown). furthermore, no alteration of endothelium after suspension in organ
baths was observed.
discussion
the present results suggest, to our knowledge for the first
time, that  xxxg93xxx  is present and functional in human placental
arteries. our results also confirm and extend the results
published by resch et al. [28], who described that  xxxg92xxx 
agonists antagonized the electrical field stimulation (efs)induced contraction of the human placental arteries in a dosedependent manner and that  xxxg92xxx  mrnas were expressed in
both placental veins and arteries. the functional and biochemical effects observed in the present study with sr 59119a
are very likely to be mediated through an  xxxg93xxx  stimulation.
indeed, we have demonstrated previously the selectivity of this
agonist for the  xxxg93xxx  in human colon and near-term
myometrium [15–17, 21]. the pharmacological evidence for
the presence of  xxxg93xxx  in human placental arteries also was
supported by the use of adrb antagonists. the sr 59119ainduced relaxation of human placental arteries was antagonized
by the blockade of  xxxg93xxx  with 10 lm propranolol but not by
the blockade of  xxxg91xxx  and  xxxg92xxx  with 0.1 lm propranolol
[24]. the vasodilator effect of salbutamol on placental arteries
is in general agreement with the findings of dennedy et al.
[23], who described a  xxxd3130xxx -induced ( xxxg92xxx  agonist)
relaxation in vitro on human umbilical arteries. moreover, in
dennedy et al., it was found that brl 37344, a preferential
 xxxg93xxx  agonist, was responsible for concentration-dependent
relaxation of human umbilical arteries. some discrepancies are
observed, however, between the study by dennedy et al. and

might be explained by the protocol differences (umbilical
arteries for dennedy et al. and placental arteries in the present
study) and by the fact that brl37344 was described, in human
colon smooth muscle tissue, to be a weak agonist on  xxxg93xxx 
compared with sr 59119a, the  xxxg93xxx  agonist used in the
present study [15].
the present results show that sr 59119a and salbutamol
were responsible for a significant increase in the camp level
but failed to increase the cgmp level. the stimulation of
camp production after exposure to sr 59119a was not
modified by the presence of 0.1 lm propranolol, whereas
salbutamol-induced camp production was inhibited after such
pretreatment, providing confirmation of the  xxxg93xxx -mediated
camp production. the relationship between camp production
and smooth muscle relaxation has been well documented.
agents that increase the synthesis of camp (e.g., adrb
stimulants), as well as agents that inhibit camp degradation
(e.g., phosphodiesterase inhibitors), all decrease smooth muscle
contraction [26, 29]. little is known about  xxxg93xxx  in vascular
tissue, but the present results are in good agreement with those
of tamaoki et al. [30], who found that  xxxg93xxx  agonist-induced
relaxation of dog pulmonary artery was mediated through

a camp increase. an apparent contradiction can be observed,
however, with the work of dessy et al. [31], who found that
 xxxg93xxx  is expressed in the endothelium of human coronary
resistance arteries and mediates adrenergic vasodilatation
through both no and vessel hyperpolarization. the relaxant
effect of sr 59119a on placental arteries observed in the
present study is unlikely to be mediated through no
production, both because the crc for sr 59119a was
unaffected by the blockade of no synthase by l-nna and
because we did not observe any sr 59119a-induced
stimulation of cgmp production.

arteries from six normotensive and six
preeclamptic women. results, expressed as
relative levels in adu, are presented as the
mean 6 sem of specific mrna normalized
to b2-microglobulin mrna in each sample.

pharmacological evidence for human placental artery
 xxxg93xxx  was strengthened by detection of  xxxg93xxx  transcripts
and protein. the  xxxg93xxx  was described to be located on
endothelial cells in rat thoracic aorta [19, 32], but its exact
localization in human placental arterial wall remains to be
investigated.
we assessed the influence of pregnancy-induced hypertension on  xxxg93xxx  presence and responsiveness, a study that to
our knowledge has not been done previously. little is known
about  xxxg93xxx  in preeclampsia, which is a condition associated
with metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance [33] and
changes of the metabolic syndrome [34], as well as with
cardiovascular changes. a polymorphism of  xxxg93xxx  has been
associated with the metabolic syndrome, including earlier onset
of diabetes mellitus and obesity. this variant is a single
substitution of arginine for tryptophan at position 64 [35].
malina et al. [36], however, reported that the trp64arg
polymorphism of  xxxg93xxx  does not predispose to preeclampsia.
response of placental arteries to sr 59119a was attenuated
in the preeclamptic compared to the normotensive group,
whereas no difference in response to salbutamol and  xxxd2401xxx  was observed. as shown in western blot experiments, this impairment of the sr 59119a-induced camp
production and relaxation occurs at the receptor level. indeed,
the density of  xxxg93xxx  proteins was decreased, whereas
 xxxg93xxx  mrna was expressed at the same level in arteries
obtained from normotensive and preeclamptic pregnancies.

adrb in human placental arteries

fig. 7. a) representative western blot analysis of  xxxg93xxx  expression in
plasma membranes from placental arteries obtained in normotensive (n ¼
3) and preeclamptic (n ¼ 3) women. expected size for  xxxg93xxx  is 68 kda.
homogenate of cho cells transfected with the human  xxxg93xxx  (adrb3cho) was used as a positive control. b) analysis of the expression of
 xxxg93xxx  immunoreactive protein in placental arteries obtained from
normotensive and preeclamptic women. the adu represents the intensity
of the bands evaluated by densitometry. each bar represents the mean 6
sem from three different normotensive and three different preeclamptic
women.

this finding suggests that posttranscriptional downregulation
of  xxxg93xxx  occurs. such downregulation of adrb already has
been reported for the human  xxxg92xxx  [21], as has the absence
of correlation between transcript and receptor expression
(although not unanimously). indeed, lecrivain et al [37]
described that treatment of late pregnant rats with high doses of
 xxxd2401xxx  (8 mg/kg twice daily) induced a selective
decrease of  xxxg92xxx -binding sites, as assessed by 125icyanopindolol binding, and a rapid alteration of their transcript
levels. in another study performed in human tissue, however,
engelhardt et al. [38], observed a 50% reduction in the number
of  xxxg92xxx  in myometrial biopsyspecimens obtained from
women treated with  xxxd2098xxx  before delivery compared with
untreated women, whereas the mrna concentrations of
 xxxg92xxx , as determined by pcr, were unaffected by  xxxd2098xxx 
treatment.
an impairment in the coupling of the receptor to adenylyl
cyclase cannot formally be ruled out. such modifications in the
coupling mechanisms between  xxxg92xxx  and the catalytic
component, implicated in the loss of adrb/adenylyl cyclase
stimulation, have been described in the myometrium at the end
of pregnancy [39], or after prolonged stimulation with an
 xxxg92xxx  agonist [37]. this has been related either to a decrease
in the amount of functional gs protein [39] or to an increased
gi activity [37].
several studies have investigated the influence of preeclampsia on response of human placental arteries to different
vasorelaxant agents, but the results reported have been
contradictory. for example, inayatulla et al. [40] concluded
that the response of placental arteries to  xxxd2401xxx  and to
sodium nitroprusside, an no donor, was not modified by
preeclampsia, whereas ong et al. [41] observed an alteration of
vasorelaxation induced by sodium nitroprusside in placental
arteries obtained from preeclamptic patients compared to

215

normotensive women. because sodium nitroprusside relaxes
arteries independently of the endothelium, this finding is in
agreement with ours. indeed, we have shown that  xxxg93xxx 
agonist-induced relaxation is endothelium independent and is
altered in arteries obtained from preeclamptic women. our
findings on the fact that  xxxg92xxx  transcription and function
were unaffected by preeclampsia seem to contradict the work
by aune et al. [10], who found that the number of functional
 xxxg92xxx  was reduced in preeclampsia (390 6 90 sites/cell in
normal pregnancy vs. 80 6 40 sites/cell in preeclampsia)
because of a reduction in the total receptor number. this
apparent discrepancy might be explained by the fact that the
pharmacological characterization of  xxxg92xxx  was determined in
isolated human mononuclear leukocytes instead of in placental
arteries that are involved in the hypertension pathophysiology
of preeclampsia. the absence of correlation between the
 xxxg92xxx  density in leukocyte and pregnancy organ (e.g.,
uterus), is highlighted by the fact that aune et al. [10] found
a higher density of functional  xxxg92xxx  in leukocytes obtained
at the end of uncomplicated pregnancies than in leukocytes
obtained 6 wk after delivery. such data suggest an increase of
 xxxg92xxx  at the end of pregnancy. breuiller et al. [42] and
rouget et al. [21], however, found that the myometrial  xxxg92xxx 
density diminished at the end of pregnancy, reaching a low
level at term. because terms were not different for normal and
preeclamptic pregnancies, the observed difference of  xxxg93xxx 
expression and function is unlikely to be related to term. the
absence of difference in terms at birth between the two groups
of women is not a surprising finding, because mostello et al.
[43] reported that gestational age at delivery for preeclamptic
pregnancies was more than 37 wk in close to 74% of the cases.
in conclusion, the present study provides compelling
evidence for the presence of functional  xxxg92xxx  and  xxxg93xxx 
in human placental arteries. their stimulation induces a vasorelaxation in these vessels. in light of these findings and our
recent data concerning  xxxg93xxx  resistance to desensitization
[21] and overexpression in human term myometrium [17], we
suggest that  xxxg93xxx  agonists may have considerable future
pharmaceutical implications in the clinical management of
pregnancy-related disorders (e.g., preterm labor) or other
conditions (e.g., intrauterine growth restrictions) in which
improvement in fetoplacental exchanges might be of potential
interest. it can be argued that the therapeutic interest of  xxxg93xxx 
agonists might, theoretically, be limited by the presence of this
receptor in other vascular beds. nevertheless, a recently
published, placebo-controlled, randomized trial showed that
a 28-day treatment with l-796568, an  xxxg93xxx  agonist, did not
induce any significant cardiovascular changes [44]. furthermore, it was described recently that the level of  xxxg93xxx 
expression is higher in human placenta than in human aorta
[45]. the consequences of the decreased number of human
placental arteries  xxxg93xxx  immunoreactive proteins, associated
with an impairment of  xxxg93xxx  function, observed in preeclampsia deserve further investigations.
