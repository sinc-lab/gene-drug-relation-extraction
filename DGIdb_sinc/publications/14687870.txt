abstract
there is an increasing awareness that a psychosis, similar to that of schizophrenic psychosis, can be derived from cocaine addiction.
thus, the prototypical atypical antipsychotic medication, clozapine, a 5-ht2/ xxxd1379xxx  antagonist, was studied for its effects on cocaineinduced dopamine (da) and serotonin (5-ht) release in nucleus accumbens (nacc) of behaving male sprague – dawley laboratory rats
with in vivo microvoltammetry, while animals’ locomotor (forward ambulations), an a10 behavior, was monitored at the same time with
infrared photobeams. release mechanisms for monoamines were determined by using a depolarization blocker, gamma-butyrolactone
(gbl). broderick prober microelectrodes selectively detected release of da and 5-ht within seconds and sequentially in a10
nerve terminals, nacc. acute and subacute studies were performed for each treatment group. acute studies are defined as single injection
of drug(s) after a stable baseline of each monoamine and locomotor behavior has been achieved. subacute studies are defined as 24h follow-up studies on each monoamine and locomotor behavior, in the same animal at which time, no further drug was administered.
results showed that (1) acute administration of cocaine (10 mg/kg ip) (n = 5) significantly increased both da and 5-ht release above
baseline ( p < .001) while locomotion was also significantly increased above baseline ( p < .001). in subacute studies, da release decreased
significantly below baseline ( p < .001) and significant decreases in 5-ht release occurred at the 15-min mark and at each time point
during the second part of the hour ( p < .05); the maximum decrease in 5-ht was 40% below baseline. locomotor behavior, on the other
hand, increased significantly above baseline ( p < .05). (2) acute administration of clozapine/cocaine (20 and 10 mg/kg ip, respectively;
n = 6) produced a significant block of the cocaine-induced increase in da ( p < .001) and 5-ht release ( p < .001). cocaine-induced
locomotion was blocked simultaneously with each monoamine by clozapine as well ( p < .001). in subacute studies, da release continued
to be blocked presumably via clozapine by exhibiting a statistically significant decrease ( p < .001), but 5-ht release increased
significantly ( p < .001), while cocaine-induced locomotor activity also continued to be antagonized by clozapine, i.e., locomotor activity
exhibited no difference from baseline ( p > .05). in summary, acute studies (a) support previous data from this laboratory and others that
cocaine acts as a stimulant on the monoamines, da and 5-ht and on locomotor behavior as well and (b) show that clozapine, 5-ht2/ xxxd1379xxx

antagonist, blocked enhanced da, 5-ht and psychomotor stimulant behavior induced by cocaine. subacute studies (a) suggest that
withdrawal responses occurred in the cocaine group, based on recorded deficiencies in monoamine neurotransmitters (b) show that
withdrawal effects in the cocaine group likely presynaptic, were distinguished from locomotor behavior, classically known to be mediated
postsynaptically, and finally, (c) suggest that clozapine, with longer lived pharmacokinetic properties, reversed 5-ht cocaine-related
withdrawal effects, but was unable to reverse da cocaine-related withdrawal responses. taken together with data from this laboratory, in
which the 5-ht2a/2c antagonist,  xxxd2419xxx , affected cocaine neurochemistry in much the same way as did clozapine, a mediation by
either separate or combined 5-ht2a/2c receptors for these clozapine/cocaine interactions, is suggested. further studies, designed to tease
out the responses of selective 5-ht2a and  xxxg1115xxx  compounds to cocaine and clozapine/cocaine, are underway.

1. introduction
1.1. addiction and psychoses
we continue to strategize possible pharmacotherapies for
cocaine-induced psychosis by studying the effects of a
variety of typical and atypical antipsychotic medications
on cocaine-induced neurochemistry and psychomotor stimulant behavior. the hypothesis derives from similarities
between schizophrenic and cocaine psychosis, similarities
which are being reported in the clinical literature at an
alarming rate (brady et al., 1991; harris and batki, 2000;
lysaker et al., 1994; mendoza et al., 1992; miller et al.,
1992; mitchell and vierkant, 1991; nambudin and young,
1991; rosenthal and miner, 1997; rosse et al., 1994; satel
and edell, 1991; serper et al., 1999; sherer et al., 1988;
taylor and staby, 1992; tueth, 1993). cocaine psychosis is
a major psychopathology (satel et al., 1991) and hyperfunction of da (dopamine)-ergic systems is a critical
element in cocaine-induced psychosis (lieberman et al.,
1990). too, what complicates the situation further, are data
which show that about 50% of the patients who suffer from
schizophrenia have also been substance abusers at some
time during their illness. actually, schizophrenic patients are
reported to feel the need to alleviate their psychosis by selftreating with reinforcing drugs (buckley, 1998; mueser et
al., 1995).
1.2. psychomotor stimulant animal model of addiction and
psychosis
one way to strategize such treatments for cocaine addiction and psychosis is to reverse certain elements of the
disorders by utilizing laboratory studies in animals (mckinney, 1989). the strategy is reasonable especially since data
from animal studies of stimulant psychosis and human
schizophrenic psychosis share the same neurochemical and
behavioral manifestations (gawin et al., 1989; margolin et
al., 1995; wise, 1995; wise and bozarth, 1987). also,

because cocaine is self-administered universally across
species (fischman, 1984; risner and jones, 1980), it is
highly likely that similar universal underlying reward mechanisms and mechanisms of consequent adverse symptomatology are similar from species to species.
the animal model of psychomotor stimulant behavior
for cocaine addiction and psychosis has been validated by
using this model to correlate antipsychotic medications
and da-ergic neuroanatomic pathways, for example, but
not exclusively, typical antipsychotics act through da
within nigrostriatal pathways and atypical antipsychotics
act through da and 5-ht within mesolimbic and mesocorticolimbic pathways (cools and van rossum, 1970;
costall and naylor, 1973; kelly et al., 1975; pijnenburg et
al., 1975; wise and bozarth, 1987). human data support
these animal data (gawin and kleber, 1986a,b; gawin et
al., 1989; meltzer, 1989). interestingly, it is currently
thought that both typical and atypical antipsychotic agents
alleviate schizophrenic psychosis via  xxxd1379xxx  blockade in
mesocorticolimbic areas, whereas  xxxd1379xxx  blockade in nigrostriatal areas is thought to produce motor side effects,
extrapyramidal symptoms (eps). nonetheless, the psychomotor stimulant animal model has become an accepted
model to study cocaine psychosis, albeit limited to certain
aspects of the disease. an accepted neuroanatomic site for
testing reversal of positive symptoms of psychosis is
within nucleus accumbens (nacc), mesolimbic nerve
terminals (weinberger et al., 1992).
1.3. cocaine, monoamine transporters and release
mechanisms
cocaine has a high affinity for monoamine transporters,
and via these transporters, re-uptake of monoamines into
presynaptic nerve terminals is inhibited (izenwasser et al.,
1990; koe, 1976); interestingly, certain subjective reward
and jittery effects from cocaine have recently been associated with these monoamine transporters (hall et al., 2002).
in addition, cocaine has been shown to be dependent on

p.a. broderick et al. / progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry 28 (2004) 157–171

stimulated release mechanisms (ng et al., 1991) and on
basal release mechanism by using the da impulse flow
inhibitor, gamma butyrolactone (gbl) (broderick, 1991b).
although cocaine is not a direct receptor acting agonist,
enhancement of da neurotransmission may also be provided adjunctly through indirect activation of da receptors, i.e., d1 and d2 (spealman et al., 1992; wise, 1995).
1.4. cocaine, monoamine concentrations and reward
mechanisms
cocaine increases da concentrations in mesolimbic
neuronal circuits and the evidence suggests that the mechanism underlying cocaine’s rewarding effect involves hyperfunction of the mesolimbic da system, particularly in
a10 nerve terminals, nacc (broderick, 1991a,b; brown et
al., 1991; hernandez and hoebel, 1988; kalivas and nemeroff, 1988) and in a10 somatodendrites, ventral tegmental
area (vta) (bradberry and roth, 1989; broderick, 1992a;
einhorn et al., 1988; kalivas, 1993; kalivas and duffy,
1990). there is a general consensus from both clinical and
preclinical studies that da mediates the rewarding effects of
cocaine (de wit and wise, 1977; gawin et al., 1989;
lieberman et al., 1990; roberts and koob, 1982; roberts
et al., 1977; tsibulsky et al., 1998; wise, 1995; wise and
bozarth, 1987; wise and rompre, 1989).
cocaine increases 5-ht concentrations in a10 terminals,
nacc, after single administration (bradberry et al., 1993;
broderick et al., 1993). sensitized 5-ht efflux in nacc
occurs after repeated cocaine administration (parsons and
justice, 1993) and cocaine-increases 5-ht release induced
by electrical stimulation of a10 neurons, in vitro (chen and
reith, 1993). importantly, when 5-ht concentrations are
deficient, such as in the fawn – hooded laboratory rat,
cocaine-induced increases in 5-ht release are attenuated
(hope et al., 1995). consistent with increased concentrations of 5-ht after cocaine, cocaine inhibits 5-ht re-uptake
in vitro (ross and renyi, 1969) and more recent studies
have shown that cocaine inhibits 5-ht re-uptake specifically in nacc (galloway, 1990). also consistent with increased concentrations of 5-ht after cocaine, cocaine
represses impulse frequency rates in vivo and in vitro in
5-ht somatodendrites, dr (cunningham and lakoski,
1988; pan and william, 1989). furthermore, 5-ht-cocaine
interactions have been associated with transporter mechanisms (carroll et al., 1993; hall et al., 2002; reith et al.,
1983).
nonetheless, a precise association between 5-ht and
brain reward remains to be determined. dietary l-tryptophan, a 5-ht precursor, and fluoxetine, a 5-ht re-uptake
inhibitor, have been reported to reduce cocaine self-administration (carroll et al., 1990a,b; mcgregor et al., 1993;
peltier et al., 1994) and depletion of forebrain 5-ht with
parachlorophenylalanine (pcpa) facilitates cocaine self-administration (loh and roberts, 1990; richardson and roberts, 1991). however, there are studies that are discrepant

159

from these previous studies (porrino et al., 1989). also, selfstimulation studies, using 5-ht2a antagonists and mixed
 xxxd1379xxx /5-ht2a antagonists, have suggested no involvement
between 5-ht2a, brain stimulation and cocaine stimulation
reward (frank et al., 1995; moser et al., 1995; ramana and
desiraju, 1989; tsibulsky et al., 1998). particularly relevant
is a possible interpretation from the latter studies that
atypical antipsychotics may not affect the regulation of
positive affect while still blocking neurochemical and behavioral effects of cocaine, which may lead to psychosis.
1.5. cocaine, monoamines and psychomotor stimulant
behavior
intra-nacc infusions of cocaine mimics the hyperlocomotor effects of cocaine (delfs et al., 1990) and the da
mesolimbic pathway has been directly implicated in the
behavioral effects of cocaine (kalivas and nemeroff,
1988). manipulations of 5-ht modulate the locomotor
stimulant effects of cocaine (walsh and cunningham,
1997). cocaine increases 5-ht in da mesolimbic pathways
simultaneously with increased locomotion, but the temporal
pattern is disrupted compared with 5-ht increases with
exploratory activity (broderick, 2001). specific 5-ht receptor mediation has been shown to correlate with open-field
locomotion, e.g., local application of 5-ht and 5-ht1a
agonist, 8-oh-dpat into median raphe nuclei causes hyperactivity (hillegaart et al., 1989) and 8-oh-dpat, has
been shown to up-modulate cocaine-induced psychostimulant behavior (de la garza and cunningham, 2000). specific 5-ht2a and  xxxg1115xxx  mediation has been shown
to correlate with cocaine-induced hyperactivity (filip and
cunningham, 2002; mcmahon and cunningham, 2001;
mcmahon et al., 2001).
1.6. monoamine interactions, basis for cocaine mechanisms
turnover of da is altered in nacc when the 5-ht
somatodendrites, dr, are electrolytically lesioned and these
interactions modulate locomotion (costall et al., 1976,
1990; herve et al., 1979). somatodendrites for da, vta,
contain dense networks of 5-ht axonal varicosities (broderick and phelix, 1997; herve et al., 1987; steinbusch,
1981; van bockstaele et al., 1994) and axons in nacc core
and shell exhibit overlapping of  xxxg2276xxx  (th)
and 5-ht (phelix and broderick, 1995; van bockstaele and
pickel, 1993).
1.7. pharmacotherapies for psychoses
pharmacotherapies for cocaine psychosis are virtually
nonexistent. thus far, clinicians are relying for therapy on
antipsychotic medications and reasonably so because, as
mentioned previously, neurochemical and behavioral similarities exist between schizophrenic and cocaine psychosis.
our main focus, then, is also in treatment strategies for

160

p.a. broderick et al. / progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry 28 (2004) 157–171

cocaine based on antipsychotics, particularly in the area of
atypical antipsychotic medications due to their dual interactions on dopamine (da) and serotonin (5-ht) in da
neuronal pathways primarily in the mesolimbic/mesocorticolimbic a10 neuronal circuitry. this now well-known 5ht2/ xxxd1379xxx  receptor affinity in the a10 circuit helps to
alleviate both positive and negative symptoms of psychosis
in addition to being mood enhancers (meltzer, 1989, 1992).
the leading hypothesis for the mechanism of action of these
newer generation, atypical antipsychotic agents, is the
presence of a high 5-ht – da receptor blockade ratio in
mesolimbic and mesocorticolimbic neural circuits. when 5ht-ergic activity is blocked as is the case with many
atypical antipsychotics, da inhibition of da release is also
blocked, consequently, increasing presynaptic da release
and balancing da blockade at postsynaptic receptor sites.
the final result is less risk for eps (glazer, 2000).

tive responses to cocaine, including expected high and rush
responses (farren et al., 2000). in another study, pretreatment with clozapine has been shown to alleviate cocaine
abuse in more than 85% of active substance (cocaine)
abusers (zimmet et al., 2000).

2. methods
2.1. drugs
clozapine was obtained from sigma aldrich, st. louis,
mo, dissolved in distilled water, and the ph of the solution
was adjusted to 2.7 with  xxxd1710xxx  powder. cocaine was
obtained from sigma aldrich, and dissolved in distilled
water.
2.2. animals

1.8. clozapine
clozapine is considered to be the prototype of the
atypical antipsychotics as it was the first to be recognized
as having few if any eps, not causing tardive dyskinesia
or parkinson’s side effects including dystonia (lieberman
et al., 1989; parsa et al., 1991). it is interesting that
clozapine is not generally a first line defense drug against
schizophrenia, but clozapine is especially effective for
treating drug-resistant schizophrenia, when typical antipsychotics have failed the patient (kane et al., 1988;
ranjan and meltzer, 1996). clozapine does not produce
catalepsy (kruzich and see, 2000). on the other hand, it
is well known that clozapine may produce agranulocytosis
in .0.5 – 2% of patients; blood serum levels must be
monitored weekly for the first 6 months. sedation and
weight gain are limiting factors in clozapine treatment
(stahl, 2000).
the varied effects of clozapine may come about because
the receptor-binding profile for clozapine is complex. clozapine binds to the following receptors: 5-ht1a, 5-ht2a, 5ht2c, 5-ht3,  xxxg1119xxx , 5-ht7, da1,  xxxd1379xxx , da3, da4, m1,
h1, a1, and a2 (brunello et al., 1995; pere, 1995; schotte et
al., 1993, 1996; stahl, 2000). clozapine has high affinity for
5ht2a receptors and low affinity for  xxxd1379xxx  receptors (meltzer, 1991, 1999; meltzer and nash, 1991; meltzer et al.,
1992). of the occupancy ratios for atypical antipsychotic
medication, clozapine has the lowest occupancy for  xxxd1379xxx 
receptors (kapur and remington, 2001; meltzer et al.,
1992).
1.9. clozapine/cocaine
clozapine is an excellent candidate to test reversal of
cocaine’s effect, not only because of low da receptor
occupancy which is thought to reduce eps, but also because
clozapine is prescribed for cocaine addiction with reasonable success, i.e., clozapine pretreatment diminishes subjec-

animals were purchased from charles river laboratories, kingston, ny, and were housed in our animal care
facilities for 1 to 2 weeks before surgery was performed.
the animal care facility operates under the auspices of the
cuny, city college institutional animal care and use
committee (iacuc) in compliance with national institute
of health (nih) guidelines. the weight range for the
animals, at the time of the studies, was 350– 475 g. animals
were group housed before surgery, individually housed after
surgery and fed purina rat chow and water ad libitum. a
12-h dark – light cycle was maintained both in the housing of
the animals and throughout the experimental studies.
2.3. surgical procedures and implantation of
microelectrodes
2.3.1. protocols follow paradigm described in broderick et
al. (2003)
each animal was anesthetized with pentobarbital na, {50
mg/kg ip [dilute (6%) solution]} and stereotaxically
implanted with a broderick prober indicator microelectrode in ventrolateral (vl) nacc (ap + 2.6, ml + 2.5, dv
7.3) (pellegrino et al., 1979). the stereotaxic equipment
was purchased from david kopf instruments, tujunga, ca.
a ag/agcl reference electrode was placed in contact with
dura, 7 mm anteriorally and contralaterally to the indicator
microelectrode. a stainless steel auxiliary microelectrode
was placed in contact with dura. broderick prober
microelectrodes were manufactured on site.
animals’ body temperature was continuously monitored
with a rectal probe and thermometer (fisher sci., fadem,
nj). body temperature was maintained at 37.5 f 0.5 jc with
an aquamatic k module heating pad (amer. hosp. supply,
edison, nj). booster injections of pentobarbital na were
administered once after the first 2 h of surgery (0.10 cc) and
once every subsequent hour (0.05 cc) to maintain an
adequate level of anesthesia throughout surgery. the total

p.a. broderick et al. / progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry 28 (2004) 157–171

time for surgery was 3– 4 h. the indicator, reference, and
auxiliary microelectrodes were held in place with dental
acrylic (jet line, lang dental, ca). animals recovered in a
bedded plexiglas cage [dimensions: 12  12  18 in.
(width  depth  height)] after surgery and before the experimental studies began, with food and water ad libitum. the
animals were treated with physiological saline (0.5 cc)
immediately and for 1 – 2 days after surgery as needed.
the antibiotic, chloramphenicol (50 mg/kg ip) was administered if needed.
in vivo microvoltammetric studies on conscious sprague –dawley laboratory rats were begun 9 –15 days after the
aseptic surgical operations were performed. on each experimental day, the animal was placed in a plexiglas –copper
faradaic chamber. the three-microelectrode assembly,
enclosed within the animal’s prosthetic acrylic cap, was
connected to a cv37 detector by means of a mercury
commutator (br. res. instr., princeton, nj), a flexible cable,
and a mating connector (bjm electronics, staten island,
ny). the cv37 detector was electrically connected to a
minigard surge suppresser (jefferson electric, magnetek,
ny), which was then connected to an electrical ground in
isolation. stable electrochemical signals for da and 5-ht
were evident before either (i) clozapine (20 mg/kg ip), (ii)
cocaine (10 mg/kg ip) or (iii) combination of clozapine and
cocaine (20 and 10 mg/kg ip, respectively) were administered. each animal was used as its own control. changes in
synaptic concentrations of da and 5-ht are presented as
percent change (percent of control) to minimize normal
between-animal variations. currents recorded were in the
order of magnitude of pa or na. in vivo microvoltammetric
scans were recorded in seconds and repeated every 5 min for
a period of 2 h before each treatment and a period of 2 h after
each treatment.
2.4. in vivo microvoltammetry: technology
in vivo microvoltammetry with a semidifferential (semiderivative) circuit was used; a clear separation of the
monoamine neurotransmitters, da and 5-ht was achieved.
dopamine and 5-ht were detected within seconds in
separate signals. oxidation peak potentials (half-wave
potentials) of + 0.14 f 0.015 and + 0.29 f 0.015 v were
characteristic for da and 5-ht. detailed methodology is
published (broderick, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991b, 1999,
2001, 2002; broderick and pacia, 2003; broderick et al.,
1993, 2000). the electrochemical signal for da, was
detected without interference at the same oxidation potential, from 3-4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (dopac), homovanillic acid (hva) and  xxxd228xxx  (aa). indeed, clear
and separated signals are routinely achieved with broderick prober microelectrodes for aa, hva and
dopac. the electrochemical signal for 5-ht was detected
without interference at the same oxidation potential, from
the 5-ht metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-hiaa)
and  xxxd3472xxx  (ua). potentials were applied with a cv37

161

detector (bas, west lafayette, in). potentials were applied
from 0.2 v to + 0.4 v with respect to a ag/agcl (1 m
nacl) electrode, at a scan rate of 10 mv/s at time constants
of 5 and 1 s tau. one scan was completed in 60 s.
nonfaradaic charging current was eliminated in the first
25 s. the neurotransmitters, da and 5-ht, were detected in
approximately 10 – 15 and 10 – 12 s, respectively, with
broderick prober stearic scid microelectrodes and
10 – 12 and 8 – 10 s, respectively, with broderick
prober  xxxd1921xxx  microelectrodes. the coulombic efficiency for the detection of 5-ht was two- to threefold
greater than that for da (broderick, 1987).
calibration curves were determined experimentally, in
vitro, in a freshly prepared deoxygenated physiological
saline– phosphate buffer solution (0.01 m, ph = 7.4). we
use ultra pure nitrogen (n2) (t.w. smith corp., brooklyn,
ny) to deoxygenate the buffer solution. solutions of da
and 5-ht (99% purity, sigma aldrich) as well as metabolites of the monoamines, were aliquoted into the buffer and
the peak height of the electrochemical signals were correlated with specific nm and am concentrations. calibration
studies were also performed in freshly prepared deoxygenated buffer solutions containing phosphotidylethanolamine
(pea), combined with bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) (sigma
aldrich), a solution which closely mimics brain constituents. these studies showed that lipid constituents of brain
and not proteins, amplify the detection sensitivity of the
indicator microelectrodes, supporting previous data which
show that lipids amplify electrochemical signals detected by
broderick prober microelectrodes; the phenomenon
is termed the lipid amplification number (lan) (broderick, 1999; broderick et al., 2000). surface enhanced raman
spectroscopy (sers) and raman resonance (rr) techniques have correlated our findings on signal amplification by
lipids (foucault et al., 2002). detection limits for basal
synaptic concentrations of da and 5-ht in nacc were 12
and 2 nm, respectively. placement of indicator microelectrodes in nacc of each animal, was confirmed by the
potassium ferrocyanide blue dot method, using a current
of 50 ma for period of 30 s. virtually no damage to brain
tissue occurred. recording characteristics of microelectrodes were stable.
2.5. behavior
locomotor activity (ambulation) was monitored with
infrared photobeams at the same time as da and 5-ht
release in nacc was detected with the broderick
prober in conjunction with in vivo microvoltammetry.
the chamber was faradaic, covered with copper to refract
possible electrical artifacts [dimensions: 24  18  23.5 in.
(width  depth  height)]. a 16  16 array of these infrared
photobeams, were held in place by an aluminum frame
which was situated 3/4 in above the plexiglas floor of the
chamber to detect locomotor activity. photobeams were
sampled by a pentium computer to define the x– y position

of the animal within a 1.5 in resolution every 100 ms. when
an x –y position was calculated, it was used to define the
frequency of locomotor activity in counts. the locomotor
activity system is a modified version of an activity pattern
monitor (apm) (san diego instruments, san diego, ca).
behavioral data are presented in absolute frequency, i.e.,
number of counts recorded.
the first hour predrug allowed exploratory behavior.
exploratory behavior is defined as open-field behavior of
ambulations (forward locomotion) wherein animals respond to the stimuli of a novel environment with high
frequency of behavioral counts. the second hour predrug
allowed the animal to become habituated before treatment.
habituation behavior is defined as a behavioral state in
which behavior exhibits reduced responses to novel stimuli; animals cease exploring or searching in their novel
environment and maintain a steady-state response to novel
stimuli.
in the acute studies, each drug was administered at the
end of the habituation period. baseline (control) values were
taken every 5 min for the last 30 min of the habituation
period at which time drug injection(s) took place. electrochemical recordings for da and 5-ht release in nacc, were
continued for 2 h; at the same time, locomotor behavior
continued to be monitored and recorded with infrared
photobeams. at the end of the 2 h drug(s) study, animals
were then placed back in their home cages.
in the subacute studies, which took place 24 h later, the
animals were again placed in the faradaic behavioral
chamber and no further drug was administered. recordings
of separate electrochemical signals for da and 5-ht
release in nacc, were taken for 1 h; at the same time,
locomotor behavior was monitored and recorded with
infrared photobeams.
2.6. data analysis
neurochemical and behavioral data, derived from the last
30 min of the habituation period, provided the baseline data.
statistically significant differences between baseline and
postdrug injection(s) for (1) da (2) 5-ht and (3) locomotor
behavior were determined by subjecting the data to one-way
analysis of variance (anova) (tested at criteria p =.05),
with subsequent application of the post hoc test, tukey’s
multiple comparison test; where appropriate, data points in
the time course were subjected to 95% confidence limits
(c.l.).

decreased from baseline ( p < .001). there was no significant difference in
da effects between subacute cocaine and clozapine/cocaine groups
( p >.05). thus, the data suggest that da-related cocaine withdrawal
responses, subacutely, is not reversed by clozapine. (b) day 2: subacute

cocaine group (n = 5), 5-ht decreased from baseline at the 15-min mark
and during the second part of the 1-h time course ( p < .05), likely reflecting
5-ht-related cocaine withdrawal effects. however, in the clozapine/cocaine
group (n = 6), 5-ht increased above baseline ( p < .001). there was a
significant difference between subacute cocaine versus clozapine/cocaine
groups ( p < .001). the data suggest that clozapine, which has a longer
pharmacokinetic half-life than does cocaine, may have reversed the 5-htrelated withdrawal effects of cocaine. (c) day 2: subacute studies: effects

was increased over baseline values ( p < .05). in the clozapine/cocaine
group (n = 6), locomotor counts showed no change from (day 1) baseline
( p >.05). there was a significant difference between subacute values in the
cocaine group versus the clozapine/cocaine group ( p < .05). due to
clozapine’s longer lived pharmacokinetic properties, clozapine-induced
sedation may be the mechanism for continued, diminished locomotion
during subacute (day 2) studies.

(same animal control) (tukey’s multiple comparison test:
p < .05, q = 3.925). nonetheless, locomotor activity decreased by 250 counts when compared with (day 1) effects
of cocaine-induced psychomotor stimulation.

studies, when no further cocaine or clozapine were administered, locomotor activity remained significantly decreased
(one-way anova: p < .0186; f = 3.843; df = 3,32). post
hoc analysis showed that no significant differences occurred
between baseline (day 1) and (day 2) values (same animal

q = 0.03647). moreover, (day 2) cocaine and clozapine/
cocaine groups did significantly differ (tukey’s multiple
comparison test: p < .05, q = 3.846) (fig. 2c).
in all groups, additional saline controls had no effect.

the subacute data suggest that these monoamine deficiencies may be associated with symptoms of withdrawal
and the data agree with clinical reports of da-ergic systems
and craving (dackis and gold, 1985; gawin and kleber,
1986a,b; lieberman et al., 1990; margolin et al., 1995).
neuroadaptation may be occurring as reported in animal
studies (broderick, 2001; koob and nestler, 1997) because
neither the short pharmacokinetic half-life of cocaine nor
that of its metabolites, provides a rational explanation
(misra et al., 1974a,b; nayak et al., 1976; mets et al.,
1999; sun and lau, 2001). of course, another plausible
explanation though, is one provided by others, that transient
compensatory changes take place a day after cocaine cessation (zahniser et al., 1988).
4.3. cocaine, monoamine interactions, possible mechanisms

4. discussion
4.1. cocaine, monoamines and psychomotor stimulant
behavior: acute studies
we have extended our work from two recent articles on
the effects of cocaine on da and 5-ht release in nacc of
freely moving and behaving laboratory rats while monitoring cocaine-induced psychomotor stimulant behavior
simultaneously. comparing the present data to the first of
these recent papers (broderick et al., 2003), we have simply
added animals to our cocaine group. comparing the present
data to the second of these recent papers (broderick and
piercey, 1998b), an entirely different group of animals was
utilized. the results from all three studies from our laboratory were equivalent, i.e., increased da, 5-ht release in
nacc occurred with increased psychomotor stimulant behavior (broderick, 2001; broderick and piercey, 1998b;
broderick et al., 2003).
4.2. cocaine, monoamines and psychomotor stimulant
behavior: subacute studies
cocaine studies in the subacute group were also extended
by increasing the number of animals above what was used in
our previous studies (broderick et al., 2003); again, the
results were equivalent. when no further drug was administered, there was a significant decrease in da release in nacc
and significant decreases in 5-ht release during specific
points in the time course data. the data are in agreement
with several reports (broderick et al., 1997; parsons et al.,
1995, 1996). in addition, the data agree with a previous report
showing long-lasting effects after a single moderate dose of
cocaine (zahniser et al., 1988). behavioral activity maintained an increase at the same time that accumbens da and 5ht release were decreased, thereby suggesting dissociative
function between behavior classically known to be mediated
via  xxxd1379xxx  postsynaptically and monoamine release and reuptake inhibitory mechanisms, presynaptically.

classical cocaine mechanisms point to a postsynaptic
 xxxd1379xxx  release with additional da release derived presynaptically from da somatodendrites, vta. current thinking
on the mechanism of action of cocaine points to a da/5ht interaction in da mesolimbic circuits. a postsynaptic
5-ht-ergic up-modulation of da in nacc has been implicated; the 5-ht2a/2c receptor has been shown to upmodulate da release in nacc after intermittent cocaine
(yan et al., 2000) and endogenously, as well (yan, 2000).
local application (infusion) of [( f )-2,5-dimethoxy-4iodoamphetamine hydrochloride] (doi), a 5-ht2a/2c agonist, was infused into nacc to increase da which was
subsequently blocked by  xxxd2419xxx , a 5-ht2a/2c antagonist. furthermore, infusion of doi in nacc was antagonized by the selective 5-ht2c/2b receptor antagonist, sb
206553, but not by the selective 5-ht2a antagonist, sr
46349b (lucas and spampinato, 2000), suggesting that da
increases in nacc after infusion of doi may be due to a
mediation by the  xxxg1115xxx .
however, prematurely pointing specifically to the 5ht2c receptor for cocaine’s mechanism of action may
present a limitation because local application (infusion into
nacc) of  xxxg1115xxx  agonists did not alter basal
locomotor activity nor mimic the stimulus effects of cocaine
(filip and cunningham, 2002; mcmahon et al., 2001). also,
a recent report shows that a  xxxg1113xxx  mediation is
prominent in blocking cocaine-induced locomotor activity
(mcmahon and cunningham, 2001). therefore, the mechanism of action of cocaine is probably dually directed, i.e.,
via classical  xxxd1379xxx  and currently explored 5-ht2a/2c/ xxxd1379xxx 
receptor circuits.
although studies by di matteo et al. (1999), do not
address cocaine, the data do importantly show the direct
autoreceptor properties of selective  xxxg1115xxx  compounds vis-a-vis the effects of these compounds when
locally applied by infusion. thus, the selective 5-ht2c
antagonist, sb 242084, increased and the selective 5ht2c agonist, ro 60-0175, decreased da release in nacc
(di matteo et al., 1999).

166

p.a. broderick et al. / progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry 28 (2004) 157–171

4.4. clozapine/cocaine: acute studies
clozapine significantly reduced cocaine-induced
increases in da release in nacc by an average of 40%
in the first hour of study and 50% in the second hour of
study. simultaneously, clozapine significantly reduced
cocaine-induced increases in 5-ht release in nacc by
an average of 138% in the first hour of study and average
of 113% in the second hour of study. also, at the same
time, locomotor activity (ambulation counts) produced by
cocaine, were reduced by an average of 500 counts in the
first half hour and by an average of 150 counts in the next
hour of study. since these are the first studies of this kind
ever performed, direct comparisons cannot be made.
nonetheless, the present studies are in general agreement
with preclinical studies in which clozapine was shown to
antagonize cocaine-induced place preference in animals
(kosten and nestler, 1994) and to block reinforcement
by intravenous cocaine in animals (loh et al., 1992).
4.5. clozapine/cocaine: possible mechanisms of action:
acute studies
the data suggest that increased 5-ht by cocaine leads
to an increase in da release perhaps via either a separate
or combined 5-ht2a/2c receptor mediation, which is
subsequently blocked by clozapine. this suggestion is
made because of previous reports of the importance of
5-ht2a/2c receptors either alone or combined in cocaine
mechanisms (filip and cunningham, 2002; mcmahon and
cunningham, 2001; yan, 2000; yan et al., 2000) and
because clozapine is, in fact, the prototypical atypical 5ht2a/ xxxd1379xxx  receptor antagonist, although not exclusively
bound to these two types of receptors. clozapine has high
antagonist affinity for the  xxxg1115xxx  and indeed,
phosphoinositol  xxxd1422xxx  activity at the 5-ht2c
receptor (herrick-davis et al., 1999, 2000; kuoppamaki
et al., 1995) has been shown specifically in nacc, in the
action of clozapine (di matteo et al., 2002). classical  xxxd1379xxx 
postsynaptic antagonism of cocaine-induced psychomotor
stimulant behavior by clozapine probably accounts, at least
in part, for the complete blockade of motor activity
observed. interestingly, in the apomorphine-induced hypomotility test, clozapine did not antagonize this presynaptic
response, unlike the  xxxd1379xxx /3 antipsychotic agent, sulpiride
(robertson and macdonald, 1986).
a mediation by 5-ht2a/2c receptors in the mechanism of
action for clozapine’s blockade of cocaine, is also further
suggested. in acute studies performed in this laboratory, we
substituted (3 mg/kg sc)  xxxd2419xxx , a 5-ht2a/2c antagonist,
for clozapine and the results were remarkably similar to
clozapine in blocking cocaine-induced monoamine release
and psychomotor stimulant behavior, although  xxxd2419xxx 
blockade of cocaine was actually weaker than that of
clozapine in all three parameters studied (broderick et al.,
2001).

 xxxd2419xxx  and clozapine do not have similar receptor
profiles, in general, but  xxxd2419xxx  is similar to clozapine in
that both are direct receptor antagonists which bind with
high affinity to 5-ht2a, 5-ht2c, adrenergic (a1) and
histamine (h1) receptors;  xxxd2419xxx  does not have bind to
da receptors (duffy et al., 2000; lutje hulsik, 2002). the
strong a1 influence is a concern, but there is good evidence
that only 5-ht2a/2c receptors are involved and a1 adrenoreceptors are not involved in the mechanism of cocaine’s
stimulant activity (filip et al., 2001). the high antagonist
affinity for h1 receptors on the part of both  xxxd2419xxx  and
clozapine, is probably not a concern. studies on h1 and
even h2 promoter polymorphisms conclude that participation of these receptors have an unlikely influence in the
clinical response to clozapine treatment (mancama et al.,
2002). thus, 5-ht2a/2c properties for clozapine are highly
likely mechanisms for clozapine’s antagonism of cocaine
effects.
it is interesting that studies on risperidone’s effects on
cocaine-induced stimulant monoamine neurochemistry and
locomotor behavior, showed that risperidone completely
blocked 5-ht release in nacc and simultaneous locomotor
activity but did not completely block da release on nacc.
indeed, risperidone significantly increased da release in
the second hour of the study, given the caveat that high
dose risperidone (2 mg/kg sc) was tested (broderick et al.,
2003).
4.6. clozapine/cocaine: subacute studies
results showed that da release in nacc, at this time,
decreased by an average of 60% during the hour of study,
while 5-ht release increased by 50% above baseline for
the hour of study and locomotor activity remained reduced by an average of 250 ambulatory counts in the first
20 min.
it is important to note that these long lasting effects of
clozapine are supported by pharmacokinetics. the half-life
of clozapine is 8 h at lower doses and 4 – 66 h at higher doses;
the hydroxlated and n-oxide derivatives are reported to be
inactive (clinical pharmacology of clozapine, 2002). interestingly, preliminary data from our laboratory have shown
that significantly increased 5-ht release after combined
clozapine/cocaine administration, does not begin to diminish
until the fifth day of recovery after drug administration.
4.7. clozapine/cocaine: possible mechanisms of action:
subacute studies
the occurrence of increased 5-ht release in subacute
studies may be explained by clozapine’s mechanism than by
cocaine’s mechanism. if we look at clozapine, 5-ht presynaptic autoreceptors, as studied in synaptosomes, may
lend an explanatory note (drescher and hetey, 1988). also,
presumably by autoreceptors, clozapine increased da efflux
in nacc (kuroki et al., 1999; volonte et al., 1997), da and

p.a. broderick et al. / progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry 28 (2004) 157–171

5-ht release in nacc in the behaving animal (broderick et
al., unpublished data; ichikawa et al., 1998) and da and 5ht release in nacc in the anesthetized animal (broderick
and piercey, 1998a). therefore, increased 5-ht release, as
shown in these subacute studies, may be mediated by
inhibitory presynaptic autoreceptors. the explanation for
decreased da release is not apparent, unless this da
decrease is simply compensatory (beart and mcdonald,
1982; herve et al., 1979).
moreover, increased 5-ht release on the second day of
study might possibly have been derived from increased
cocaine serum levels due to the longer lasting effects of
clozapine since a clinical study reported enhanced cocaine
serum levels after administration of both clozapine and
cocaine to cocaine addicts (farren et al., 2000). it is
noteworthy that increased 5-ht release on the second day
of study, did not occur in a risperidone/cocaine group
(broderick et al., 2003).
thus far, research in our laboratory suggests that clozapine’s action on cocaine is mediated at least partly, via 5ht2a/2c receptors because the results presented here, from
clozapine/cocaine combination studies, resemble those
obtained during subacute studies when substituting the 5ht2a/2c antagonist,  xxxd2419xxx  for clozapine. in subacute
studies with  xxxd2419xxx /cocaine, when no further  xxxd2419xxx 
or cocaine was administered, da release in nacc decreased
and 5-ht increased to a statistically significant level, just as
did results, subacutely, in the clozapine/cocaine group.
there were some differences in monoamine reactions
during the subacute studies between the  xxxd2419xxx /cocaine
group and the clozapine/cocaine group, e.g., the da response was weaker and the 5-ht response was somewhat
stronger. notably, locomotor activity was significantly
higher on the second day for the  xxxd2419xxx /cocaine group
vis-a-vis the clozapine/cocaine group. the clozapine/cocaine group continued to exhibit sedation, possibly through
residual potent, muscarinic anticholinergic receptor mediation (richelson and souder, 2000; broderick et al., 2001).
on the other hand, the atypical antipsychotic medication,
the 5-ht2a/ xxxd1379xxx  receptor antagonist, risperidone, did not
exhibit subacute responses to cocaine as did clozapine. in
fact, da and 5-ht release returned to baseline and locomotor activity increased insignificantly above baseline
(broderick et al., 2003). it is noteworthy however, that
studies with the high dose of risperidone (2 mg/kg sc) were
performed (broderick et al., 2003). high dose risperidone
exhibits more typical than atypical antipsychotic properties
(williams, 2001).
not to be neglected, though, is a possible mediation by
the  xxxg1108xxx  because clozapine exhibits moderate
receptor binding for the  xxxg1108xxx  (schotte et al.,
1993, 1996; sumiyoshi et al., 1995). importantly, the  xxxg1108xxx  receptor has been shown clinically to mediate schizophrenic psychosis (chou et al., 2003) and preclinically, to
mediate the action of da in nacc (ichikawa and meltzer,
2000). finally, a1 antagonism has been shown to mediate

167

inhibition of dorsal raphe (dr) firing by clozapine through
5-ht1a receptors (sprouse et al., 1999).

5. conclusions
acute studies showed that clozapine blocked accumbens
da, 5-ht and locomotor effects of cocaine. these studies
are the first of their kind. the subacute studies are also
unique; the subacute studies allowed us to study withdrawal
effects of cocaine in addition to the unexpected long-lasting
effects of clozapine/cocaine treatment on accumbens da
and 5-ht release in the freely moving and behaving animal.
enhanced 5-ht release may help alleviate clinical depression associated with cocaine withdrawal (price et al., 2001),
although decreased da release could be a disadvantage,
possibly leading to craving (dackis and gold, 1985).
nonetheless, critical treatment strategies for cocaine addiction and psychosis could be derived from these results.
