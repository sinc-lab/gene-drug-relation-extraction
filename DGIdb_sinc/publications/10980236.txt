retinal cholinergic and dopaminergic deficits of aged rats are improved following treatment with gm1 ganglioside.  selected cholinergic and dopaminergic markers were compared in the retina of aged (20-22-months-old) and young (3-months-old) rats before and after treatment with gm1 ganglioside. the dopaminergic markers,  xxxg2276xxx ,  xxxg618xxx , dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid were comparable in the young and aged animals and gm1 treatment did not alter them. in contrast,  xxxd2546xxx  binding, a marker for the  xxxg2149xxx , was diminished in the aged retina and treatment with gm1 restored binding to values found in the young animals. the cholinergic markers  xxxg440xxx  and  xxxd2264xxx  binding, a marker for the high-affinity choline transport, were depressed in aged rats and gm1 corrected the deficits.
