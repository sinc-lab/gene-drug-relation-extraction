introduction: intra-operative cerebral ischemia can be catastrophic, and volatile anesthetic
agents have been recognized for their potential neuroprotective properties since the 1960s. in
this review, we examine the neuroprotective effects of five volatile anesthetic agents in current or
recent clinical use: isoflurane,  xxxd3197xxx ,  xxxd1844xxx , halothane and  xxxd1993xxx .
methods: a review of publications in the national library of medicine and national institutes of
health database from 1970 to 2007 was conducted.
results: volatile anesthetic agents have been shown to be neuroprotective in multiple animal
works of ischemic brain injury. short-term neuroprotection (,1 week post-ischemia) in
experimental cerebral ischemia has been reported in multiple works, although long-term
neuroprotection (>1 week post-ischemia) remains controversial. comparison works have not
demonstrated superiority of one specific volatile agent over another in experimental models of
brain injury. relatively few human works have examined the protective effects of volatile
anesthetic agents and conclusive evidence of a neuroprotective effect has yet to emerge from
human works.
conclusion: proposed mechanisms related to the neuroprotective effect of volatile anesthetic
agents include activation of atp-dependent potassium channels, up-regulation of  xxxd2738xxx 
synthase, reduction of excitotoxic stressors and cerebral metabolic rate, augmentation of periischemic cerebral blood flow and up-regulation of antiapoptotic factors including map kinases.

introduction
cerebral ischemia during surgery can be catastrophic,
and volatile anesthetic agents have been recognized for
their potential neuroprotective properties since the
1960s1. several common procedures that place patients
at high risk for peri-operative cerebral ischemia include
cardiac surgery, carotid endarterectomy and neurological surgery2–7. cardiac surgery, carotid endarterectomy
and neurosurgical procedures are frequently performed
under general anesthesia with volatile agents, although
other anesthetic techniques may be used.
this review emphasizes the ether and ether-like
volatile agents that have been used clinically in the last
three decades: isoflurane,  xxxd3197xxx ,  xxxd1844xxx ,
halothane and  xxxd1993xxx . other gaseous agents are not
considered in this review. volatile anesthetic agents are
administered to patients via the lungs, usually through
an endotracheal tube, laryngeal mask airway or other
airway device8. of the five volatile agents, isoflurane
(introduced in 1981),  xxxd3197xxx  (introduced in 1995)
and  xxxd1844xxx  (introduced in 1993) are most commonly

used today. halothane (introduced in 1956) and
 xxxd1993xxx  (introduced in 1972) are being phased out at
many centers because of undesirable side effects9.
there is ongoing research into the mechanism or
mechanisms responsible for the state of general
anesthesia induced by the volatile agents. many volatile
anesthetic–receptor interactions have been described to
date. volatile agents exert an agonist (activating) effect
on c- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) and glycine receptors9.
volatile agents exert an antagonist (inhibiting) effect on
neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, serotonin
type 3 receptors, glutamate receptors, voltage-activated
potassium channels, voltage-activated sodium channels
and voltage-activated calcium channels. the anesthetic
effects of volatile agents are likely a consequence of one
or more of these receptor interactions9.
a review of the national library of medicine and
national institutes of health database (http://www.pubmed.gov) between 1970 and 2007 yielded 194 publications pertaining to the effects of isoflurane,
 xxxd3197xxx ,  xxxd1844xxx , halothane or  xxxd1993xxx  in
cerebral or neuronal ischemia in vivo, in vitro, ex vivo
or human works. within this set of publications, we
identified 78 trials (contained within 69 publications),
which described controlled in vivo (animal) works of
volatile agents in cerebral ischemia. of these trials, 71%

(55 : 78) reported a neuroprotective effect of volatile
agents in cerebral ischemia. of the 78 in vivo trials,
most used halothane, isoflurane,  xxxd1844xxx  or  xxxd3197xxx , with isoflurane and halothane being the most
popular.
short- and long-term neuroprotective
effects in vivo
numerous works of experimental brain injury in
animals have reported short-term neuroprotection with
isoflurane10–24, sevoflurane25–29, halothane30–34 and
desflurane21,30,35. for ease of classification, we define
‘short-term’ to indicate works with endpoints that are
less than 7 days post-ischemia, while ‘long-term’
indicates works with endpoints that are seven or more
days post-ischemia. to date, most works of volatile
agents in cerebral ischemia tested isoflurane or
halothane. a majority of animal works to date have
reported evidence of a short-term neuroprotective effect
of volatile anesthetic agents.
several recent works have demonstrated long-term
neuroprotective effects of volatile anesthetic agents,
although there is no consensus on this point. one recent
work used middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats to
show prolonged 8-week neuroprotection from isoflurane11. similar findings have been described in global
cerebral ischemia in rats lasting at least 6 weeks25.
however, other works have reported short-term, but
not long-term, neuroprotection in the setting of
focal20 or global ischemia14. of the articles examined
in this review, there is substantial support both
for11,13,15,25–27,36–38 and against14,16,20,39,40 the existence of long-term neuroprotective effects of volatile
anesthetic agents. no single reason explains these
conflicting conclusions, although some researchers
have suggested that volatile anesthetics may only delay,
but not prevent, cell death20.
peri-, pre- and post-ischemic therapy
most animal works to date have emphasized
treatment with volatile anesthetic agents within 1 hour,
either before or after the onset of ischemia. hereafter,
we will refer to this as ‘peri-ischemic’ therapy.
relatively few works have examined extended preischemic (.1 hour before ischemia) or post-ischemic
(more than one hour after ischemia) therapy. periischemic therapy with volatile anesthetic agents has
been reported to be neuroprotective in numerous in vivo
works10–12,14,16,19,21–26,28–30,32–35.
pre-ischemic therapy (anesthetic pre-conditioning)
has been studied less, although the results have
generally been positive15,17,18,27,31. intermittent preconditioning with  xxxd3197xxx  at various frequencies
and durations before experimental global cerebral
ischemia protects against subsequent ischemic cell
loss27. similar findings have been reported with
isoflurane pre-conditioning 1 hour before experimental
middle cerebral artery occlusion12.
of the few post-ischemic works done to date,
most have reported no protective benefit of extended

or
post-ischemic
treatment
with
isoflurane40
34,39
. one work compared post-ischemic
halothane
isoflurane to nitrous oxide/fentanyl after middle cerebral
artery occlusion in baboons40. in this work, isoflurane
was associated with larger infarction, increased risk of
hemorrhagic transformation and worse neurobehavioral
scores compared with nitrous oxide/fentanyl anesthesia40. presently, there is little evidence that postischemic therapy with volatile agents long after ischemia would be beneficial. this suggests that volatile
agents probably do not have a role for post-ischemic
stroke therapy in humans.
neuroprotective mechanisms
multiple mechanisms explaining the neuroprotective
effect of volatile anesthetic agents have been proposed
and studied (figure 1). volatile anesthetic agents have
multiple effects in vivo with or without ischemic injury,
and it is difficult to separate cause from effect.
nevertheless, several broad mechanisms have been
identified in the last 20 years of research. these
mechanisms include up-regulation of  xxxd2738xxx 
synthase, activation of atp-dependent potassium channels, reduction of excitotoxic stressors and cerebral
metabolic rate, augmentation of peri-ischemic cerebral
blood flow and up-regulation of antiapoptotic factors
including map kinases.
 xxxd2738xxx  synthase
several works have identified an up-regulation of
 xxxd2738xxx  synthase as a potential mechanism for the
neuroprotective effects of volatile agents. pre-ischemic
up-regulation of  xxxd2738xxx  synthase has been reported
with exposure to isoflurane13,18 and halothane18. these
works suggest a protective effect of  xxxd2738xxx  from
anesthetic pre-conditioning. however,  xxxd2738xxx  may
be both neuroprotective and neurotoxic42, and other
works report data that suggest a toxic role for nitric
oxide in the setting of anesthetic pre-conditioning43.
works of anesthetic pre-conditioning have found that
 xxxd2738xxx  is associated with a variety of other
neuroprotective events. for example,  xxxd2738xxx  may
be associated neuroprotective cascades including extracellular-regulated kinase42,44.  xxxd2738xxx  may also upregulate pi3k-akt42. pre-ischemic up-regulation of
extracellular-regulated kinase and pi3k-akt is likely
neuroprotective by antiapoptotic mechanisms (discussed below).
ion channels
anesthetic pre-conditioning with isoflurane is associated with increased activity of atp-regulated potassium channels on mitochondria (mitokatp)17,45–47.
activation of mitokatp causes mild hyperpolarization.
this inhibits neuronal firing, metabolic expenditure and
physiological derangement48. although the precise
mechanism by which volatile agents affect mitokatp is
unclear, it is possible that direct activation of the
adenosine a1 receptors by volatile agents leads to
neurological research, 2009, volume 31, march 129

figure 1: mechanisms of neuroprotection ascribed to isoflurane

activation of mitokatp46. other ion channels may also
be important in the anesthetic pre-conditioning.
modulation of twik-related halothane-inhibitable kz
channels may be important in the cellular response to
hypoxia under general anesthesia49.
free radicals
the effect of volatile anesthetic agents on free radicals
is unclear. ischemia–reperfusion injury is associated
with the generation of free radical/reactive oxygen
species in the brain, and volatile agents have been
shown to reduce oxidative stress in some settings50,51.
conversely, there is some evidence that volatile
anesthetic protection may actually depend on the
availability of free radicals. for example, one work
reported that free radical scavengers such as
dimethylthiourea abolish pre-conditioning effects of
volatile agents52. similarly, one work reported that
anesthetic pre-conditioning may depend on the availability of free radical species generated from the
electron transport chain53. the relationship between
volatile anesthetics and free radicals remains unclear.
130 neurological research, 2009, volume 31, march

excitotoxicity
volatile anesthetic agents may reduce excitotoxic and
metabolic stress. isoflurane and other volatile agents are
thought to act in part on the inhibitory gaba receptors in
the brain54. activation of gaba receptors inhibits
depolarization, brain activity and energy expenditure
and thereby protects against the excitotoxic stresses
that occur during and after ischemia54. isoflurane has
been associated with a reduced response to the excitatory
transmitters n-methyl-d-aspartic acid54–56 and a-amino-3hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate55,57,58. various
other works have reported decreased release of glutamate23,59,60 and decreased response to glutamate61
during central nervous system ischemia with isoflurane
exposure. further physiological stabilizing effects of
isoflurane include decreased central nervous system
catecholamines during ischemia22,29,62. some of these
effects may arise directly from the anesthetic properties
of the volatile agents, inasmuch as general anesthesia
with these agents inevitably involves decreased cerebral
metabolic oxygen consumption and decreased brain
activity8,63, with or without ischemia.

cerebral blood flow
isoflurane and other volatile agents have vasodilatory
effects in vivo, and isoflurane has been reported to
increase cerebral blood flow in non-ischemic rats
compared with fentanyl or pentobarbital-based anesthesia64. several reports have suggested that the volatile
anesthetic agents promote favorable cerebral blood flow
during ischemia. in animal models of ischemic
stroke32,65 and traumatic brain injury66,67, volatile
anesthetic agents are associated with increased blood
flow in the ischemic cortex and penumbral areas, which
is likely beneficial.
conversely, other works have shown that the
protective effects of volatile anesthetic agents occur
independent of changes in cerebral blood flow68,69. in
global cerebral ischemia in rats, one work reported that
post-ischemic cerebral blood flow was not significantly
different between isoflurane and fentanyl/nitrous oxideanesthetized groups, in spite of the fact that isoflurane
was associated with better outcomes68. likewise,
another work found that the short-term benefit of
halothane pre-conditioning before experimental middle
cerebral artery occlusion occurs without any measurable change in cerebral blood flow31. finally, in select
circumstances, volatile agents may theoretically diminish cerebral blood flow to watershed regions of the
brain. for example, isoflurane is associated with
regional hypoperfusion and the cerebral steal phenomenon compared with propofol in human patients with
cerebrovascular disease70. whether or not changes in
cerebral blood flow explain the protective effect of
volatile anesthetic agents remains unclear.
inhibition of apoptosis
volatile anesthetic agents are associated with
decreased apoptotic cell death in the post-ischemic
period16,20,37,71. the cellular basis for the inhibition of
apoptosis has been traced to modulation of intracellular
calcium levels. intracellular calcium functions as a
second messenger within neurons and other cells72.
during ischemia, neurons experience a substantial
elevation of intracellular calcium, which may lead to
neuronal death73. evidence suggests that volatile
anesthetic agents cause moderate elevation of intracellular calcium levels and relative control of intracellular
calcium levels such that ischemic neurons are able to
survive the ischemic period73. isoflurane has been
reported to cause this moderate rise in intracellular
calcium in both hypoxic and non-hypoxic neurons73,74.
in non-hypoxic neurons, this rise in calcium leads to the
expression of a variety of antiapoptotic factors including
akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellularregulated kinase75,76, which may contribute to the preconditioning effects of volatile anesthetic agents. during
ischemia, isoflurane treatment results in a moderate
elevation of intracellular calcium. this leads to activation of ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii19,77,
the pi3k-akt cascade77,78 and mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular-regulated kinase15,77–79. these
factors inhibit apoptotic cell death.  xxxd2738xxx 

production that occurs with anesthetic pre-conditioning
may also be an initiating factor for the elaboration of
antiapoptotic proteins42. finally, knockout works have
shown that the beneficial effects of isoflurane preconditioning are severely restricted by akt-1 knockout
mutation in mice80. taken together, this evidence
suggests that volatile anesthetic agents exert an antiapoptotic effect by up-regulation of specific antiapoptotic factors.
comparative works
one area of clinical interest relates to the choice of
volatile anesthetic agent for the ‘best’ neuroprotective
effect for surgical patients at risk for intra-operative
cerebral ischemia. a number of works have directly
compared outcomes between two or more volatile
anesthetic agents in the context of cerebral ischemia18,21,24,30,33,62,71,81–91. most in vivo works compared one volatile agent to another in global
ischemia21,24,83–88 or focal ischemia18,30,33,89.
no individual agent has yet emerged as a superior
neuroprotectant from these comparative works, and
surprisingly, few works have identified meaningful
differences between specific agents in ischemic pathology. numerous works of volatile agents and cerebral or
neuronal ischemia have reported equivalent outcomes
between isoflurane and halothane18,71,84–86 and
between isoflurane and sevoflurane62,71,84–86. several
works have compared the effects of three different
volatile agents in ischemic injury in vivo or in vitro, and
these works tend to show equivalent outcomes62,81,82,84. a recent work tested isoflurane,  xxxd3197xxx ,  xxxd1844xxx  and halothane in an ex vivo model of
cerebellar ischemia in rats and reported a dosedependent neuroprotection with pre-conditioning that
was similar for all four agents91. a small number of
works have identified potential differences among
agents. isoflurane may be associated with lower brain
catecholamine levels compared with halothane in
global cerebral ischemia in rats24, and isoflurane may
also be associated with relative preservation of microtubules compared with halothane87. however, the
clinical applicability of this is limited given the
diminishing status of halothane in clinical practice. it
seems likely that the neuroprotective effects of volatile
anesthetic agents are a class effect, and consequently,
there is no compelling reason to choose one agent over
another strictly for the purposes of neuroprotection.
human works
whether or not volatile anesthetic agents are protective
in humans remains unclear. clinical scenarios that have
served as a platform for the study of potential protective
effects include carotid endarterectomy1,90,92–94, coronary artery bypass grafting with or without cardiopulmonary bypass95 and neurological surgery6,96–98.
common endpoints in human works include electroencephalographic signals of ischemia1,93,94, brain tissue
po2 and ph6,97,98, serum markers of neuron death95,
computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging
neurological research, 2009, volume 31, march 131

neuroprotective effect of volatile anesthetic agents: g. a. matchett et al.

(mri) signs of infarction96 and gross neurological
outcome4,96.
carotid endarterectomy surgery is ideal for the study
of anesthetic agents because works may be controlled
with awake surgical patients who undergo the surgery
with local anesthesia alone99. several small works of
volatile anesthetics in carotid endarterectomy have
reported results that suggest a protective effect of
volatile anesthetics. halothane (combined with cyclopropane) was associated with fewer neurological
sequelae compared with an awake group in a carotid
endarterectomy work1. isoflurane has been shown to
permit lower regional cerebral blood flow without
electroencephalography signs of ischemia compared
with halothane92, and isoflurane has also been shown to
decrease the frequency of cerebral ischemia on eeg
during carotid endarterectomy compared with  xxxd1993xxx 
and halothane90. however, large controlled works have
largely failed to demonstrate benefit from general
anesthesia with volatile agents compared with awake
patients in carotid endarterectomy, and several works
have concluded that awake carotid endarterectomy
leads to better outcomes than carotid endarterectomy
under general anesthesia with volatile agents100–103.
however, it is also possible that the benefit from awakecarotid endarterectomy relates more to the superior
neuromonitoring that is possible with an awake, talking
patient compared with one under general anesthesia.
several works have examined implications of volatile
anesthesia in the setting of middle cerebral artery
occlusion during neurovascular procedures, and the
results are somewhat mixed. hoffman et al.97,98 compared  xxxd1844xxx  to etomidate in middle cerebral artery
occlusion. this work and a similar work by hoffman
et al. in 2000 reported favorable increases in brain
tissue ph and po2 with  xxxd1844xxx  anesthesia. this
difference may have related to a relative decrease in the
cerebral metabolic rate in the  xxxd1844xxx  group.
conversely, lavine et al.96 studied isoflurane compared
with a mixed intravenous anesthetic in middle cerebral
artery occlusion but reported more infarction in the
isoflurane group. in cardiac surgery, volatile agents have
not been shown to have better or worse outcomes than
other anesthetic techniques. kanbak et al.95 studied
isoflurane compared with propofol anesthesia in cardiac
surgery and found similar serum s-100 b levels and
neurological scores between the two groups. whether
or not volatile anesthetic agents are neuroprotective in
human patients remains an open question.
conclusion
volatile anesthetic agents have been shown to be
neuroprotective in the setting of cerebral ischemia in
multiple animal works, although conclusive human
works are lacking to date. comparative works have not
shown superior neuroprotection of one specific agent
over another. the protective effects of volatile anesthetic agents relate to activation of atp-dependent
potassium channels, up-regulation of  xxxd2738xxx 
synthase, reduction of excitotoxic stressors and cerebral

metabolic rate, augmentation of peri-ischemic cerebral
blood flow and up-regulation of antiapoptotic factors
including mitogen-activated protein kinases.
