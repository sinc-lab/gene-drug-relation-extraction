 xxxg2296xxx  (tnf) blocking agents are an
important advance in the clinical treatment of rheumatoid
arthritis (ra). they were introduced into clinical practice
while limited safety information was available. this means
that intensive monitoring is needed early in the life cycle of
these new drugs. setting up large cohort studies to monitor
efficacy, safety, and tolerability in long term use of these
so-called biological agents will provide information about
the consequences of using tnf blocking agents in chronic
rheumatic disease like ra. currently, a dutch multicentre
registry on biological agents in ra is being set up. this
study aimed at investigating the efficacy and toxicity of
tnf blocking agents in patients with ra at one participating academic centre by a drug survival analysis. since
1997 230 patients with ra at the centre have been treated
with tnf blocking agents for the first time (94 with adalimumab, 120 with infliximab, and 16 with etanercept). no
differences in drug survival between the three tnf
blocking agents were found despite the diversity in
selection and patient numbers. adverse events which
occurred, leading to discontinuation, were similar to those
from previous reports.

t

hree  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf) blocking agents,
etanercept (enbrel), infliximab (remicade), and adalimumab (humira) are currently being used for the treatment
of rheumatoid arthritis (ra). in clinical trials these so-called
biological agents have been shown to be efficacious for the
treatment of ra.1–3 no studies reported a significant increase
in serious adverse events compared with placebo, and in open
label extension trials the level of safety and tolerability was
sustained.4 5
however, in daily clinical practice patients with ra may differ considerably—for example, in their comorbidity and
concurrent drug treatment, from patients in randomised
clinical trials. these differences may influence the efficacy and
safety profile.
reports from daily clinical practice are still limited, but a
number of safety issues have arisen, like reactivation of tuberculosis (tb), demyelinating disease, drug induced systemic
lupus erythematosus, opportunistic infections, and the risk
for malignancies.6–9 these issues need further elucidation. setting up large cohort studies to monitor long term efficacy and
safety will provide information about the true incidence of
these rare adverse events. at present a number of these registries on biological agents are being set up or have already
started in countries world wide. in the process of setting up a
dutch registry, which will monitor all patients receiving
biological agents in 10 rheumatology centres, data were
collected on all patients with ra at our centre who had
received tnf blocking agents since 1997. in this prospective
study we investigated the survival during treatment with tnf
blocking agents.

patients and methods
all patients with ra, fulfilling the 1987 american college
of rheumatology criteria,10 who started treatment with
adalimumab, infliximab, or etanercept before 1 january 2003
at the department of rheumatology of the university medical
centre nijmegen were identified. patients receiving
adalimumab had been treated in phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical
trials. adalimumab was given subcutaneously or intravenously at different dosages and intervals in several trials.
after completion of the initial trial patients entered an open
label extension study, in which they were treated with
adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously every other week, with
the possibility of a dose increase to 40 mg weekly when high
disease activity or exacerbation persisted. patients receiving
infliximab and etanercept were treated in daily clinical
practice and fulfilled the dutch criteria for tnf blocking
therapy; had moderate to high disease activity, and high
dosage methotrexate and at least one other disease modifying
antirheumatic drug (dmard) had failed. they started at
standard dosing regimens (infliximab 3 mg/kg every eight
weeks and etanercept 25 mg twice a week).
data collected were age, sex, disease duration, rheumatoid
factor positivity and the number of previous dmards. at the
start of the tnf blocking treatment data on 28 joint counts,
erythrocyte sedimentation rate, visual analogue scale general
health, prednisone dose, and the starting date of treatment
were collected. if a patient discontinued tnf blocking
treatment the date at which they stopped and the reason for
discontinuation were collected. if a patient had received more
than one tnf blocking agent only the initial treatment was
used in the analysis. the disease activity score (das28) was
used for assessment of disease activity. all data collected were
entered into an electronic patient registry, consisting of an
access database, with a visual basic application (both microsoft). this system, called polidas, was developed in collaboration with the department of medical technology assessment
of the university of nijmegen for long term registration and
monitoring of patients with ra.
statistical analysis
differences in baseline characteristics between the groups
were studied using one way analysis of variance or chi2 if
appropriate. drug survival was estimated by lifetable analysis
with 1 january 2003 as the censoring date. this was
performed for each tnf blocking agent as well as for the total
group. drug survival between groups was compared using
wilcoxon (gehan) statistics. analyses were performed
with sas statistical software (version 8.0, sas institute inc,
usa), and spss statistical software (version 10.0, spss inc,
usa).

results

allergic reactions all occurred in patients given intravenous
tnf blocking therapy; observed symptoms were hypotension,
hypertension, flushing, dyspnoea, cyanosis, urticaria, and
pruritus. twelve patients stopped tnf blocking agents because
of infections, seven of them within the first year (table 4).
reactivation of tb was seen in two patients. one patient had
started tnf blocking therapy at a time when screening for tb
was not yet implemented and the other patient developed tb
despite screening. malignancies occurred in six cases: one
metastatic mamma carcinoma, one cutaneous cell carcinoma,
one non-hodgkin’s lymphoma, one metastatic prostate carcinoma, one oat cell carcinoma, and one patient developed a
squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus and hepatic
metastases of an adenocarcinoma of unknown origin (the last
four patients died).

two hundred and thirty patients with ra were identified: 94
had started adalimumab treatment between april 1997 and
september 2000; 120 patients had started infliximab since
january 2000; and 16 had started etanercept since february
2000. table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the groups.
no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics were found, except for a significantly higher mean das28
at the start and a larger number of patients receiving steroids
in the adalimumab group.
figure 1 shows the drug survival for the total group of 230
patients with ra. the median survival time was 37 months.
maximum follow up time for adalimumab, infliximab, and
etanercept was 69, 35, and 30 months, respectively. figure 2
shows the drug survival curves for the three tnf blocking
agents. one year survival percentages were 73% for adalimumab, 66% for infliximab, and 74% for etanercept. no
significant differences in survival between the groups were
found.
table 2 shows the reasons for discontinuation within the
first year of tnf blocking therapy. table 3 lists the adverse
events which led to discontinuation within the first year of
tnf blocking therapy.

conclusion and discussion
we investigated drug survival of three tnf blocking agents in
a group of patients with active, longstanding ra. about 70% of
the patients still were receiving tnf blocking therapy after the
first year. no significant differences in survival were seen
between patients receiving different agents despite the diversity of patient selection and patient numbers in the groups.

the survival percentages do not show any great differences
from those of other reports. the south sweden arthritis
research group reported a 20 month drug survival of 79%
in 166 patients with ra receiving etanercept and 75% in
135 patients with ra receiving infliximab.11 in a spanish registry of biological agents the survival was 86% after 12
months in a combined group of 1309 patients (1070 ra)
receiving 1172 treatment courses of infliximab and 164 of
etanercept.12
also, reasons for discontinuation reported in this study are
similar to those given in previous reports.1 3 5 11 inefficacy and
adverse events were encountered in equal numbers for the
adalimumab and etanercept group. in the infliximab group
adverse events were relatively more often a reason for discontinuation. this might be explained by the number of infusion
reactions. we did not perform a statistical comparison on the
reasons for discontinuation between the groups because this
was considered inappropriate: firstly, because of the differences in patient selection. patients receiving adalimumab were
treated in the first clinical trials with this agent, in a period
when there were fewer other treatment options. this group
had more severe ra, indicated by a higher mean disease activity at the start and a larger number of patients receiving steroids. these factors could influence drug survival. secondly, the
small number of patients receiving etanercept, because of the
scarcity of this drug in the netherlands, limits a direct
comparison with the other agents studied.
all serious adverse events encountered have been
reported in previous studies, with the exception of
dermatomyositis.1 3 5 11 13 infections, both minor recurrent and
major infections requiring admission to hospital, were reasons
for discontinuation within the first year in 7/191 (4%)
patients. all these patients had longstanding ra and most of
them were treated with immunosuppressive drugs simultaneously. this rate is comparable with other reports on tnf
blocking agents.1 5 11 14 six malignancies of different origin
were seen in this group.

although an increased incidence of malignancies—for
example, lymphoma, might be expected in theory,9 the
number of cases seen was small. this might be attributed to
the short period of treatment with tnf blocking agents, the
relatively short duration of follow up, or the small number of
patients.
it remains to be determined whether treatment with
tnf blocking agents leads to an increased incidence of
major infections and malignancies and rare adverse
events. to gain more insight it is necessary to study
larger groups of patients during a longer period of follow up.
merging data from registries which monitor toxicity and
efficacy of tnf blocking agents could provide such
information. furthermore, it would enable a study of
possible risk factors for serious adverse events. this implies a
joint effort of rheumatologists, industry, and regulatory
authorities. recently a multicentre registry has been set
up in the netherlands. in parallel, several european
rheumatology departments are cooperating to set up a
european registry on biological agents. we strongly
encourage such an effort because it would be an important
step towards increasing knowledge about the long term
safety and tolerability of current and future biological
therapies in clinical practice.
