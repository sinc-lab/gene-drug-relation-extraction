isolated perfused and paced guinea pig heart to test for drug-induced changes of the qt interval.  one of the biomarkers for assessing the risk of a cardiac adverse event is drug-induced prolongation of the qt interval. a model is needed for evaluating the potential liability of test compounds on qt interval in vitro. since qt intervals can be generated from paced or spontaneously beating hearts, data so generated can also be used for validating qt(c) correction equations.
