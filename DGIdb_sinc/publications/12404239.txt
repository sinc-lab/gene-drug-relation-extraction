see editorial on page 1733.
background & aims: the  xxxg11xxx  ( xxxg11xxx ) is
the major bile salt transporter in the liver canalicular
membrane. our aim was to determine the afﬁnity of the
human  xxxg11xxx  for bile salts and identify inhibitors.
methods: human  xxxg11xxx  was expressed in insect cells.
adenosine triphosphatase (atpase) assays were performed, and bile salt transport studies were undertaken.
results: the  xxxg11xxx  gene,  xxxg11xxx , was cloned and a
recombinant baculovirus was generated. infected insect
cells expressed a 140-kilodalton protein that was absent
in uninfected and in mock-infected cells. an atpase
assay showed  xxxg11xxx  to have a high basal atpase activity. transport assays were used to determine the
michaelis constant for  xxxd3296xxx  as 4.25 ␮mol/l,
with a maximum velocity of 200 pmol 䡠 minⴚ1 䡠 mgⴚ1
protein. inhibition constant values for other bile salts
were 11 ␮mol/l for  xxxd2218xxx , 7 ␮mol/l for glycochenodeoxycholate, and 28 ␮mol/l for taurochenodeoxycholate.  xxxd1781xxx , rifampicin, and  xxxd2215xxx 
were proved to be competitive inhibitors of  xxxg11xxx   xxxd3296xxx  transport, with inhibition constant values of 9.5
␮mol/l, 31 ␮mol/l, and 27.5 ␮mol/l, respectively.
progesterone and tamoxifen did not inhibit  xxxg11xxx .
conclusions: the human  xxxg11xxx  is a high-afﬁnity bile salt
transporter. the relative afﬁnities for the major bile salts
differ from those seen in rodents and reﬂect the different bile salt pools.  xxxg11xxx  is competitively inhibited by
therapeutic drugs. this is a potentially signiﬁcant mechanism for drug-induced cholestasis.

ile is an aqueous solution containing bile salts,
phospholipids, and electrolytes. bile ﬂow is dependent on the active transport of these constituents into
biliary canaliculi. the  xxxg11xxx  ( xxxg11xxx ),
 xxxg12xxx  ( xxxg12xxx ), and multidrug
resistance–associated protein 2 ( xxxg15xxx ), located in the
canalicular membrane of hepatocytes, are responsible for

b

the translocation of bile salts, phosphatidylcholine, and
organic anions, respectively, into the canalicular space.
from there, bile ﬂows via the bile ducts to the duodenum
where bile salts emulsify fat from the diet.1 any disruption of bile formation or ﬂow is termed cholestasis.
bile salts are synthesized in the liver by the enzymatic
modiﬁcation of cholesterol, and are composed of a steroid
nucleus and an aliphatic side chain. the primary bile
salts  xxxd1685xxx  and  xxxd1660xxx  comprise 90% of
bile salts in humans, with  xxxd1660xxx  forming
60% and  xxxd1685xxx  40% of this value. the secondary bile
salts  xxxd1835xxx , lithocholate, and  xxxd3479xxx 
comprise 5% of the human bile salt pool.2 most (99%) of
the  xxxd1685xxx  and  xxxd1660xxx  are conjugated at
c-24 through an amide bond with the amino acids
glycine or taurine. the ratio of glycine to taurine conjugates is 3:1 in humans; the ratio is reversed in many
other mammals.3 the pattern of modiﬁcation with glucuronate, sulphate, or glucose at hydroxyl groups of the
steroid nucleus also varies between humans and other
mammals. the result is different bile salt pools in different species.
 xxxg11xxx , an  xxxd83xxx  (atp)– binding cassette (abc) transporter, is an integral membrane protein
belonging to 1 of the largest superfamilies of proteins
identiﬁed. forty-eight human abc transporters have
been identiﬁed, with diverse cellular localizations and
substrate speciﬁcities. the closest human homologues of

 xxxg11xxx  include the fellow members of the b subclass of
the superfamily,  xxxg12xxx  1 and
 xxxg12xxx .4,5  xxxg11xxx  orthologues have been identiﬁed in rat,
mouse, and skate, and these proteins share 82%, 80%,
and 68% amino acid identity, respectively, with the
human protein. bile salt transport experiments have been
performed in vitro with these orthologues expressed in
insect cells.6 –9 the rat transporter was found to have
afﬁnities for bile salts in the following order: taurochenodeoxycholate ⬎ tauroursodeoxycholate ⬎  xxxd3296xxx , whereas the mouse transporter had the following
afﬁnities: taurochenodeoxycholate ⬎  xxxd2218xxx  ⬎  xxxd3296xxx .6,8 the afﬁnity of human  xxxg11xxx  for bile salts is
unknown.
the gene encoding  xxxg11xxx ,  xxxg11xxx , is mutated in
what is now known as  xxxg11xxx  deﬁciency.10 –13 this form of
progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis is an autosomal recessive liver disease that presents in early childhood with a subsequently progressive cholestasis, leading
to end-stage liver disease, usually in the ﬁrst decade of
life. patients have normal serum levels of ␥-glutamyltranspeptidase (␥-gt), high serum levels of bile salts,
and low biliary levels of bile salts, accompanied by
pruritus, jaundice, and a marked intracellular cholestasis.
the combination of the phenotype seen in patients, and
the fact that the rat, mouse, and skate orthologues of
 xxxg11xxx  are highly competent atp-dependent bile salt
transporters in vitro, strongly suggests that  xxxg11xxx  is the
major bile salt transporter of human liver.
drug-induced cholestasis is a frequent problem in
clinical medicine, but the underlying pathogenic mechanism(s) are poorly deﬁned.14 this presents a problem in
identifying individuals susceptible to the drugs concerned, and results in unnecessary liver injury.15  xxxd3296xxx  transport by rat  xxxg11xxx  in vitro and in vivo is
competitively inhibited by several clinically relevant
drugs.16 –18 furthermore, mouse  xxxg11xxx  adenosine triphosphatase (atpase) activity is inhibited in a concentrationdependent manner by various drugs.8 intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (icp) is a reversible form of
cholestasis that occurs in late pregnancy, with an incidence in europe of 1–15 cases per 1000 pregnancies.19
the clinical phenotype includes pruritus, abnormal liver
function, and cholestasis, and although in most cases
there is no permanent damage to the mother’s liver, icp
can be fatal to the fetus. women with icp can have
either normal or elevated levels of ␥-gt, the latter being
associated in some cases with heterozygous mutations in
the gene encoding  xxxg12xxx  ( xxxg12xxx ).20 –23 furthermore,
a proportion of women taking oral contraceptives also
experience normal ␥-gt cholestasis. it has been pro-

posed that estrogen is a trans-inhibitor of rat  xxxg11xxx ,
eliciting its effect from the canaliculus.16 therefore,
these rat and mouse studies indicate that inhibition of
 xxxg11xxx  is a potential mechanism for the development of
acquired cholestatic liver disease. at present, inhibitors
of human  xxxg11xxx  are unknown.
in this study, we expressed the wild-type human
 xxxg11xxx  in vitro to determine its afﬁnity for the major bile
salts and to identify inhibitors of bile salt transport. the
results provide the ﬁrst demonstration of the function of
the human  xxxg11xxx , and now provide a system in which to
elucidate the cholestatic potential of therapeutic drugs.

materials and methods
generation of full-length  xxxg11xxx 
complementary dna
total rna from human liver was extracted by using
rnazol b (biogenesis, poole, england). first strand complementary dna (cdna) synthesis was performed by using c.
therm. polymerase (roche, basal, switzerland) in a 20 ␮l
reaction containing 1 ⫻ reverse transcriptase buffer, 5 mmol/l
mgcl2 , 5 mmol/l dithiothreitol, 5%  xxxd1896xxx , 1
␮mol/l primer, 20 mmol/l deoxynucleoside triphosphates
(ab gene, epsom, england), 10 units rnaase inhibitor
(roche), and 6 units c. therm. polymerase. products were
subsequently ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) by
using ventr dna polymerase (new england biolabs, beverly,
ma) in a 50 ␮l reaction containing 1 ⫻ thermopol (new
england biolabs) buffer, 2 mmol/l  xxxd2534xxx  , 5% dimethyl
sulfoxide, 200 ␮mol/l deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 1
␮mol/l each primer, and 1 unit of ventr polymerase. a nested
pcr using 2 ␮l of pcr product as template was performed as
above to engineer restriction endonuclease sites for cloning
purposes. thermal cycling was performed with a pcr express
(hybaid, franklin, ma) as follows: 94°c for 4 minutes for 1
cycle, then 40 cycles with 1 minute at 94°c, 30 seconds at
various annealing temperatures, 2 minutes at 72°c. reactions
were terminated after 5 minutes’ extension at 72°c.
the  xxxg11xxx  coding cdna was ampliﬁed in 3 fragments
(figure 1). each was cloned individually into pgem-teasy
(promega, madison, wi) and sequenced to ensure ﬁdelity of
ampliﬁcation, using an abi 373a (applied biosystems, foster
city, ca) automated sequencer with 500 ng template dna, 1
␮mol/l primer, and 3 ␮l taq fs mix (applied biosystems).
each fragment was subsequently subcloned into palter-1
(promega) by using the engineered restriction sites. six histidine codons were introduced at the 3⬘ end of cdna fragment
3 by pcr (as above), using 10 ng of cloned fragment 3 in
palter-1 as a template. the resulting fragment 3-plushistidine was cloned into pgem-teasy and subcloned into
palter-1. cdna fragments 2 and 3-plus-histidine were
ligated in palter-1 by using  xxxg11xxx -unique restriction
sites before being subcloned into the baculovirus transfer
vector pbluebac4.5 (invitrogen corporation, groningen, the

netherlands). generation of the full-length  xxxg11xxx  cdna
by subcloning fragment 1 into the vector necessitated growth
of the recombinant escherichia coli at 30°c. both strands of the
full-length  xxxg11xxx  cdna were sequenced (as above) to
ensure ﬁdelity of the clone. all primers (genosys, cambridge,
england) were designed by using the  xxxg11xxx  genbank
messenger rna sequence (accession number, af091582) and
are available from j.a.b. on request.

generation of recombinant baculovirus
a recombinant baculovirus containing the  xxxg11xxx 
cdna was prepared by using the bac-n-blue baculovirus
expression system (invitrogen corporation), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. the presence of  xxxg11xxx  in the
recombinant baculovirus was conﬁrmed by  xxxg11xxx -speciﬁc
pcr by using ventr polymerase (as above), and intermediate
and high-titer viral stocks were prepared in sf900 cells (invitrogen corporation). sf21 cells for cotransfection and plaque
assays were grown in tc-100 medium (invitrogen corporation) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (invitrogen
corporation), and sf900 cells were grown in sf900-ii media
(invitrogen corporation).

expression of  xxxg11xxx  in  xxxd102xxx 
insect cells
log phase  xxxd102xxx  insect cells (invitrogen corporation) grown in suspension in excell 405 medium (jrh
biosciences, lenexa, ks) were infected with recombinant
 xxxg11xxx  baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of
4, 7.5, 10, and 15. three days after infection, cells were
harvested by centrifugation at 1000g for 5 minutes and
resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mmol/l mannitol, 2 mmol/l
egta, 50 mmol/l tris-hcl [ph 7], 5 mmol/l  xxxd302xxx , 1 mmol/l phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride, 8 ␮g/ml
aprotinin, and 10 ␮g/ml leupeptin). cells were homogenized by using a glass/teﬂon (vwr, poole, england) homogenizer, and undisrupted cells and nuclei were removed
by centrifugation at 500g for 10 minutes at 4°c. membranes
were subsequently pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000g
for 1 hour at 4°c and resuspended in either lysis buffer for

atpase assays or  xxxd3296xxx  uptake buffer (50 mmol/l
sucrose, 100 mmol/l kno3 , 12.5 mmol/l mg(no)2 , 10
mmol/l tris/hepes [ph 7.4])6 for  xxxd3296xxx  transport
assays.

immunoblot analysis
thirty micrograms of membrane proteins were resolved on a 7.5%  xxxd3215xxx –polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis gel before transfer to a polyvinylidene ﬂuoridemembrane (immobilon-p; millipore, bedford, ma). the
membrane was probed with a 1:1000 dilution of an antihistidine tag antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase
(invitrogen corporation) overnight at 4°c, and bound antibody was visualized by using chemiluminescent substrate
(ecl, amersham, little chalford, england) and exposed to
x-omat ﬁlm (kodak, hemel hempstead, england) for 5
minutes.

atpase assays
thirty micrograms of membrane vesicles were incubated in a 50 ␮l reaction with 2 mmol/l atp in atpase
buffer (50 mmol/l tris-hcl, 150 mmol/l nh4cl, 5 mmol/l
 xxxd2534xxx  , 0.02% nan3 [ph 7.4]) in the presence or absence of
200 ␮mol/l vanadate (sigma, st. louis, mo). after 30 minutes incubation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50
␮l of 12%  xxxd3215xxx . inorganic phosphate
release was quantiﬁed by using the following colorimetric
assay: 100 ␮l of a 1:1 solution of 6% ascorbate and 1%
ammonium molybdate was added, and after incubation at
room temperature for 5 minutes, 150 ␮l of a solution containing 2% sodium citrate, 2% sodium metarsite, 2% acetate
was also added. the reaction was incubated for a further 20
minutes at 37°c before reading at a750 nm.

transport assays
transport assays were performed as described previously by using the rapid ﬁltration method.6,8 seventy to 100
micrograms of membrane vesicles in a 100 ␮l reaction were
incubated for 30 seconds in  xxxd3296xxx  uptake buffer in the
presence or absence of 5 mmol/l atp, at various concentra-

ends to facilitate their cloning. the 3⬘ end of  xxxg11xxx 
was modiﬁed to encode 6 histidine residues at the carboxyl terminus of the recombinant protein. unique restriction endonuclease sites in the coding sequence
shared between overlapping fragments were used to reconstruct the full-length cdna from the three fragment
clones. the integrity of the full-length  xxxg11xxx  cdna
was conﬁrmed by dna sequencing.

ml of ice-cold  xxxd3296xxx  stop solution (50 mmol/l sucrose,
100 mmol/l kcl, 10 mmol/l tris-hcl [ph 7.4]) and by the
application to a prewetted glass ﬁber ﬁlter (whatman, maidstone, england) under vacuum. membranes were rapidly
washed 3 times with 4 ml of ice-cold  xxxd3296xxx  stop
solution supplemented with 1 mmol/l unlabelled  xxxd3296xxx 
before scintillation counting. the afﬁnity of human  xxxg11xxx  for
 xxxd2218xxx , taurochenodeoxycholate, and glycochenodeoxycholate (all sigma) was determined by incubating 0 ␮mol/l,
10 ␮mol/l, 20 ␮mol/l, and 30 ␮mol/l of these bile salts in
the presence and absence of 5 mmol/l atp and by determining their ability to inhibit the transport of 3 ␮mol/l, 6
␮mol/l, and 9 ␮mol/l of [3h]- xxxd3296xxx  during 30 seconds. the michaelis-menten equation was used to calculate the
afﬁnity of human  xxxg11xxx  for  xxxd3296xxx  (km). dixon plot and
lineweaver-burk analyses were used to calculate the afﬁnity for
the other bile salts inhibition constant (ki).
potential inhibitors of  xxxg11xxx  ( xxxd1781xxx , rifampicin,
 xxxd2215xxx , progesterone, and tamoxifen [all sigma]) were
tested at 0 ␮mol/l, 10 ␮mol/l, and 30 ␮mol/l for their
ability to inhibit the atp-dependent transport of 6 ␮mol/l
[3h]- xxxd3296xxx  over 30 seconds. ki values of identiﬁed
inhibitors were determined by using indicated concentrations
(figure 6) of the compounds with 3 ␮mol/l, 4.5 ␮mol/l, and
6 ␮mol/l of [3h]- xxxd3296xxx .

the  xxxg11xxx  cdna in pbluebac4.5 was recombined with the bac-n-blue baculovirus genome in insect
cells to generate a recombinant  xxxg11xxx  baculovirus.
the level of expression of human  xxxg11xxx  in membrane
vesicles prepared from infected  xxxd102xxx  cells was compared at different multiplicities of infection (moi) 3 days
after infection. uninfected (negative) and nonrecombinant virus–infected (mock)  xxxd102xxx  cells were included
as controls. the western blot analysis shows a protein of
approximately 140 kilodaltons only in the  xxxg11xxx 
baculovirus–infected cells (figure 2). an moi of 7.5 was
found to be optimal and was used for subsequent infections. cells were harvested after 3 days, which was optimal for expression after a time course experiment was
performed (data not shown).
 xxxg11xxx  generates a high basal
atpase activity
membrane vesicles prepared from uninfected
(negative)  xxxd102xxx  cells, mock-infected  xxxd102xxx 
cells, and  xxxd102xxx  cells infected with the  xxxg11xxx 
baculovirus were tested for atpase activity. cells expressing  xxxg11xxx  exhibited an increased basal atpase activity compared with uninfected or mock-infected cells.
this activity was inhibited by vanadate, consistent with
the introduction of a novel  xxxg22xxx  (figure 3).
 xxxg11xxx  is a transporter with a high afﬁnity
for bile salts
the afﬁnity of human  xxxg11xxx  for  xxxd3296xxx  was
determined by measuring the initial rates of atp-dependent uptake at increasing concentrations of [3h]- xxxd3296xxx  and by inside-out membrane vesicles prepared
from  xxxd102xxx  cells infected with the  xxxg11xxx  baculovirus. the michaelis constant (km) for  xxxd3296xxx  was

the afﬁnity of  xxxg11xxx  for a range of other bile salts was
determined by their ability to complete with [3h] xxxd3296xxx . the data was analyzed by dixon plot (fig-

was inhibited by  xxxd1781xxx , rifampicin, and  xxxd2215xxx  (table 2). dixon plot analysis showed ki values
for these inhibitors to be 9.5 ␮mol/l for  xxxd1781xxx ,

tion is kept low by their removal from portal blood by a
number of transporters located in the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes.24 the true intrahepatocyte concentration of free bile salts is not known. there are good
reasons why concentrations should be kept low— bile
salts are highly cytotoxic detergents. this all points to
the need for a high-afﬁnity export system for bile salts in
the canalicular membrane. the canalicular bile salt concentration is approximately 103-fold higher than that in
portal blood, and there has to be an active transport
mechanism capable of operating against such a steep
concentration gradient. it was shown some time ago that
canalicular bile salt transport is an atp-dependent process.25–28 it is now clear that most transporters in the
canalicular membrane are members of the  xxxg22xxx  superfamily. members known to be expressed in
the canalicular membrane are  xxxg12xxx  1 (a broad-speciﬁcity drug efﬂux pump),  xxxg12xxx 
(which is critical to biliary phospholipid secretion),
 xxxg15xxx  (an organic anion transporter), and  xxxg11xxx .4,5,29

the function of the expressed protein was initially
assessed by using an atpase assay (figure 3). the generation of a high basal atpase activity dependent on
 xxxg11xxx  expression was detected, which was inhibited by
vanadate, and is consistent with the introduction of a
novel  xxxg22xxx .

the function of human  xxxg11xxx  in isolation outside the
canalicular membrane of hepatocytes.
the human  xxxg11xxx  gene was cloned and expressed
in vitro. the construction of the full-length cdna was
problematic in 2 respects. first, several pcr errors were
encountered, but the ﬁnal construct conformed to the
predominant wild-type human sequence. second, there
appeared to be a large selective disadvantage against e.
coli containing clones with the full-length wild-type
insert and, thus, recombinants predominated. this is
possibly caused by the presence of putative prokaryotic
transcription start sites within the human sequence.
therefore, the full-length clone could only be obtained
by lowering the propagation temperature to 30°c. for
this reason, the bac-n-blue system was chosen to create
a recombinant baculovirus. unlike other systems, recombination between the baculovirus genome and the transfer vector occurs in insect cells rather than in bacteria. in
this way, another step in e. coli was avoided. for the
purposes of this work, the sequence was modiﬁed to
encode additional 6 histidine residues at the carboxyl
terminus of the protein. this allowed the use of an
antihistidine tag antibody to facilitate protein identiﬁcation by western blot analysis. the protein visualized
on western blot analysis had a molecular mass of 140
kilodaltons (figure 2). this is identical to that seen for
the rodent orthologs expressed in insect cells, and is
consistent with the predicted molecular mass of the
unmodiﬁed amino acid chain (146 kilodaltons).6,8,30 this
contrasts with the 160 kilodalton protein observed in
canalicular membrane vesicles isolated from rat liver.
this discrepancy is presumed to reﬂect a degree of underglycosylation in the insect cell system.6,31

dixon plot analysis was used to evaluate the kinetics of the drug-induced
inhibition of atp-dependent  xxxd3296xxx  uptake. results represent the
mean of 3 separate experiments from 2 vesicle preparations.

transport studies were conducted by measuring the
uptake of [3h]- xxxd3296xxx  into inside-out membrane
vesicles. the maximum transport velocity and afﬁnity, or
km, for this conjugated primary bile salt were calculated
(figure 4). the km for  xxxd3296xxx  was 4.25 ␮mol/l and
represents the highest afﬁnity reported for a bile salt

transporter. this value is almost identical to that previously determined for intact human canalicular membrane
vesicles (4.2 ␮mol/l), and suggests that  xxxg11xxx  is responsible for the high-afﬁnity  xxxd3296xxx  transport shown
by such preparations.28 for other bile salts, their ki value
was derived by assessing their ability to compete with
[3h]- xxxd3296xxx  transport, using dixon plot analysis
(figure 3). this quantiﬁes the afﬁnity of the protein for
the molecule, even if transport velocity of these potential
substrates cannot be measured directly. ki values of 11
␮mol/l for  xxxd2218xxx , 7 ␮mol/l for glycochenodeoxycholate, and 28 ␮mol/l for taurochenodeoxycholate were
obtained. the afﬁnities of the human and rodent  xxxg11xxx 
orthologs for various bile salts are detailed in table 1.
the human transporter has the following order of afﬁnity:  xxxd3296xxx  ⬎ glycochenodeoxycholate ⬎  xxxd2218xxx  ⬎ taurochenodeoxycholate. rat and mouse
proteins have the highest afﬁnity for taurochenodeoxycholate, whereas the opposite is true for the human
transporter. these data reﬂect the relative proportions of
the different bile salts in rodent and human bile.
human  xxxg11xxx  has a high afﬁnity for all 4 bile salts
tested, which represent the major bile salt species present
in human bile.2 this correlates with a near-total absence
of these bile salts in the bile of patients with  xxxg11xxx 
deﬁciency.11 together, this argues for  xxxg11xxx  being the
major bile salt transporter in the canalicular membrane
of human liver. in contrast,  xxxg11xxx  knockout mice have
no marked liver disease and continue to secrete 30% of
bile salts into bile, predominantly tauromuricholate and
novel tetrahydroxylated bile salts.32 thus, in mice, it
appears that signiﬁcantly different mechanisms of bile
salt conjugation are present, which result in bile salt
species that are capable of being excreted by other canalicular membrane transporters, for example  xxxg15xxx .33
furthermore, our data make it unlikely that the p-type
atpase familiar intrahepatic cholestasis–associated protein 1 (fic1), also situated in the canalicular membrane,34 is a major bile salt transporter in human liver.
fic1 deﬁciency is a form of familial intrahepatic cholestasis caused by mutations in the gene encoding fic1,
atp8b1, and patients are phenotypically similar to patients with  xxxg11xxx  deﬁciency.35 the function of fic1 has
not yet been elucidated, although it has been suggested
that it is an aminophospholipid ﬂippase or a bile salt
transporter.36,37
inhibition of  xxxg11xxx  is a potential mechanism for the
development of several acquired cholestatic liver diseases,
including drug-induced cholestasis and icp.  xxxd3296xxx  transport by rat  xxxg11xxx  in vitro was found to be
competitively inhibited by the immunosuppressive drug

 xxxd1781xxx , the sulfonylurea antidiabetic drug  xxxd2215xxx , and the endothelin receptor agonist  xxxd358xxx .16,17 the insulin sensitizer troglitazone has also been
shown to inhibit  xxxd3296xxx  transport in vivo and in
canalicular membrane vesicles prepared from rat liver.18
mouse  xxxg11xxx  atpase activity has been shown to be inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by  xxxd1781xxx ,  xxxd2215xxx , and the antituberculosis drugs
rifamycin sv and rifampicin.8 the ability of hormones to
inhibit bile salt transport was also investigated in an in
vitro bile salt transport assay involving rat  xxxg11xxx  and the
physiologic estrogen metabolite, estradiol-17␤-glucuronide. experiments showed that estradiol-17␤-glucuronide only inhibited  xxxg11xxx  if the metabolite had been
transported into the lumen of vesicles by  xxxg15xxx . it was
concluded that estrogen is a trans-inhibitor of bile salt
transport, eliciting its effect on  xxxg11xxx  from the bile canaliculus.16
in this study, we have identiﬁed several clinically
relevant inhibitors of bile salt transport by human  xxxg11xxx 
(table 2). dixon plot analysis was used to derive the ki
values, which were 9.5 ␮mol/l for  xxxd1781xxx , 31
␮mol/l for rifampicin, and 27.5 ␮mol/l for  xxxd2215xxx  (figure 6). these values are all based on the
initial concentrations in the transport buffer. for lipophilic drugs, these may not be the true concentrations
in the microenvironment of the lipid membrane. however, a similar inhomogeneous distribution is likely to be
present in vivo. for rifampicin, a concentration of 31
␮mol/l equates to the upper limit of the recommended
trough serum concentration during antituberculosis dosing. during rifampicin therapy, the intrahepatic concentration may be higher still because of the presence of a
basolateral uptake transporter.38 therefore, even during
normal therapeutic dosing, rifampicin may result in signiﬁcant cholestasis.
lineweaver-burk analysis conﬁrms that all 3 drugs are
competitive inhibitors of  xxxg11xxx  (data not shown). these
drugs are believed to be cis-inhibitors of  xxxg11xxx , but it
cannot be excluded that there is an element of transinhibition because of diffusion of the drugs across the
vesicle membrane. in a previous study,  xxxd1781xxx  was
found to competitively inhibit the atp-dependent

transport of  xxxd3296xxx  by human canalicular membrane vesicles with a ki value of 0.3 ␮mol/l.39 the
decreased afﬁnity observed for isolated  xxxg11xxx  in our
system versus that determined in human canalicular
membrane vesicles may be caused by the presence of both
cis- and trans-inhibition of  xxxg11xxx  in the latter. table 3
compares ki values obtained for  xxxd1781xxx , rifampicin, and  xxxd2215xxx  for human and rat bseps. although the ki values for the rat protein are lower, the
rank order of inhibition by the drugs is the same for both
species.
progesterone and the  xxxg730xxx  antagonist tamoxifen did not inhibit wild-type human  xxxg11xxx . alterations in progesterone metabolism have been observed in
women with icp, and it may be that metabolites of
progesterone will inhibit  xxxg11xxx .40 furthermore, because
rat  xxxg11xxx  may be trans-inhibited by estrogen metabolites,
the same may be true for progesterone.16 we cannot
exclude that the previously identiﬁed cholestatic effect of
tamoxifen is mediated through the trans-inhibition of
 xxxg11xxx .41
because only the minority of patients receiving these
drugs develop cholestasis, it is likely that polymorphisms
in  xxxg11xxx  exist in such patients, which confer a greater
susceptibility to the cholestatic effect of the drug. a
potential mechanism is that the variant  xxxg11xxx  has an
increased afﬁnity for the drug (decreased ki value) compared with the wild-type protein. similarly, cis- or transinhibition of variant forms of  xxxg11xxx  may underlie the
development of hormone-induced low ␥-gt cholestasis.
in summary, we have shown that the human  xxxg11xxx  is
a bile salt transporter with a high afﬁnity for the major
bile salts of human bile. differences in the relative
afﬁnities for the major bile salts are seen compared with
the rodent orthologs and reﬂect the different bile salt
pools. furthermore, our data show that  xxxg11xxx  is inhibited
by several clinically relevant drugs and, for the ﬁrst time,
this provides a direct link to drug-induced cholestasis in
humans.
