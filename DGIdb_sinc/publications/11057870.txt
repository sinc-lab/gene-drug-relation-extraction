 xxxd461xxx , an inhibitor of  xxxg1060xxx , inhibits urokinase/urokinase-receptor expression and  xxxg1440xxx  secretion by peripheral blood monocytes...  it is now recognised that acute myocardial infarction results from the rupture of atherosclerotic plaques. lymphocytes and macrophages, which infiltrate rupture sites, contribute to plaque degradation by expressing urokinase ( xxxg1767xxx ) bound to cell membrane by urokinase receptor ( xxxg1768xxx ) and by secreting metalloproteinase  xxxg1440xxx . we have previously demonstrated that the uptake of oxidised ldl (ox-ldl) by monocytes induces an increase of  xxxg1767xxx  and  xxxg1768xxx  expression. the present study shows that the expression of  xxxg1767xxx  and  xxxg1768xxx  induced by ox-ldl on monocyte surface is suppressed by  xxxd461xxx  (a synthetic inhibitor of  xxxg1060xxx , bayer) from 2 nm. this leads to reduced plasmin generation and monocyte adhesion to  xxxg2422xxx . furthermore, higher concentrations of  xxxd461xxx  (50-100 nm) reduce the expression of  xxxg1767xxx  and  xxxg1768xxx  on unstimulated monocytes. it also inhibits  xxxg1440xxx  secretion but has no effect on timp-1 secretion, suggesting that the decrease in  xxxg1440xxx  has a real protective effect on plaque stabilisation. the inhibitory effect of  xxxd461xxx  on  xxxg1767xxx  expression and  xxxg1440xxx  secretion can be explained by the inhibition of nf-kappa b translocation into the nucleus, as shown by immunofluorescence. as farnesyl-pyrophosphate reverses the effect of  xxxd461xxx , it is postulated that these effects could also be due to the inhibition of ras prenylation. this was confirmed by confocal microscopy, which shows the ras delocalisation from the monocyte membrane. the  xxxd461xxx -induced effects on monocyte functions could explain, at least in part, the protective effect of this drug against atherothrombotic events.
