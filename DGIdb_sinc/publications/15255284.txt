abstract
alp decreased in 60 and 90 mg  xxxd2798xxx  groups by
1.9 and 2.6%, respectively (p < 0.05 for both dose levels when compared to placebo). these results show that
 xxxd2798xxx  is effective in reducing bone turnover in postmenopausal women.

 xxxd2798xxx  is a novel selective  xxxg730xxx  modulator
(serm). here we studied the effects of  xxxd2798xxx  on
bone turnover in postmenopausal women. this was a
randomized, double-blind study in which 159 healthy
postmenopausal women received 30 (n = 40), 60
(n = 40) or 90 mg (n = 40) of  xxxd2798xxx  or placebo
(n = 39) for 3 months. bone resorption was assessed by
measuring the urinary outputs of n- and c-terminal
crosslinking telopeptides of type i collagen (ntx and ctx,
respectively). bone formation was assessed by measuring
the levels of procollagen type i n propeptide (pinp),
procollagen type i c propeptide (picp), and bone-specific
alkaline phosphatase (bone alp) in serum. all markers
were studied at baseline, 3 months, and 2–4 weeks after
cessation of the medication.  xxxd2798xxx  decreased bone
resorption dose-dependently, as seen from falls in ntx by
6.1, 9.4 and 12.9% in the 30, 60 and 90 mg  xxxd2798xxx 
groups, respectively (p < 0.05 for all dose levels when
compared to placebo). ctx values decreased in the 90 mg
 xxxd2798xxx  group by 4.8% (p < 0.05). a dose-dependent
decrease was also observed in the bone formation markers:
pinp values decreased by 9.8 (p < 0.05) and 15.3%
(p < 0.01), and picp values by 12.0 and 11.9% in
the 60 and 90 mg  xxxd2798xxx  groups, respectively. bone

introduction
osteoporosis is among the most significant disorders in elderly women1,2. thus, early detection of
increased bone loss and development of effective
prophylactic and treatment options for osteoporosis is
a major challenge for health care in the western
world. bisphosphonates, calcitonin and raloxifene
have been shown to reduce fracture risk in large
randomized trials3–6 and therefore they have been
approved by the us food and drug administration
(fda) for both prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. hormone replacement therapy (hrt) has a
consistent beneficial effect on bone mineral density
(bmd) and a clear trend for decreasing the risk of
vertebral and non-vertebral fractures7. also, in the
women’s health initiative study hrt reduced
the risk of hip fractures but on the other hand

effect of  xxxd2798xxx  on bone turnover

increased the risk of some other chronic diseases,
leaving doubts about the long-term use of hrt8.
selective  xxxg730xxx  modulators (serms)
exhibit both  xxxg730xxx  agonistic and antagonistic effects that are tissue-specific. raloxifene is
currently the only serm approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. although
raloxifene has favorable tissue-selective effects in
bone5 and in the cardiovascular system9, it aggravates
hot flashes and causes a 3.1-fold increase in the risk
of venous thromboembolic events5. therefore,
new serms with a good tissue-specific profile and
better tolerability are needed.
 xxxd2798xxx  ( xxxd2798xxx ) [chemical name: (z-2(4-(4-chloro-1,2-diphenyl-but-1-enyl)phenoxy) ethanol] is a triphenylethylene serm with strong bone
preserving effect in ovariectomized rats10. it exerts
estrogen-like effects in bone marrow cultures by
enhancing osteoblastic differentiation with a mechanism that is different from that of raloxifene11. also, in
osteoclast cultures the effects of  xxxd2798xxx  are similar
to those of estrogen, but clearly different from
the effects of tamoxifen and raloxifene12. clinically
 xxxd2798xxx  is well tolerated; it does not cause clinically significant changes in endometrium, but induces
estrogenic effect on vaginal epithelium13,14. thus,
 xxxd2798xxx  is a promising serm for the prevention
and treatment of osteoporosis.
it has been established that biochemical markers
reflecting bone resorption and bone formation can
predict the changes in bmd and the risk of fractures,
which both take years to become manifest. these
markers include n-terminal crosslinking telopeptide
of type i collagen (ntx) and c-terminal crosslinking
telopeptide of type i collagen (ctx), which reflect
bone degradation15,16. the procollagen type i
n propeptide (pinp), procollagen type i c
propeptide (picp), and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bone alp) can be used to assess bone
formation15,16. as part of a placebo-controlled
prospective trial14,17, we assessed the effect of 30, 60
and 90 mg of  xxxd2798xxx  on these biochemical
bone markers in healthy postmenopausal women.

methods
subjects
a total of 176 healthy postmenopausal women were
screened for the study in two academic research
centers in finland (department of obstetrics and

komi et al.

gynecology, helsinki university central hospital,
helsinki and oulu deaconess institute, oulu). out
of the 160 women that were randomized, one subject
in the placebo group did not start the regimen, so the
final number of subjects in the study was 159. all
subjects were 45–65-year-old caucasian postmenopausal women, with at least 12 months from the last
spontaneous menstrual bleeding and at least 3 months
since cessation of hrt. the other criteria for
inclusion/exclusion have been reported elsewhere14,17. the protocol was reviewed by the independent ethics committees in both study centers and
written informed consent was obtained from all
participants. the study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki.

study design
this was a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase ii
study, with parallel group design14,17. briefly, after an
initial screening visit, the subjects were randomized
to receive 30, 60 or 90 mg of  xxxd2798xxx  or placebo
for 3 months. placebo capsules containing the same
inactive excipients and with similar appearance to the
 xxxd2798xxx  capsules were used to keep the study
blinded. thus, regardless of treatment and dose level,
each subject took three identical capsules once daily,
one from each container. after the screening visit, the
subjects were assessed at baseline (randomization,
start of the medication), at 1 month and at 3 months.
in addition to the treatment phase, all subjects had
a clinical visit 2–4 weeks after cessation of the
medication.

evaluation of bone turnover
biochemical markers of bone turnover were assessed
at baseline, at 3 months and 2–4 weeks after cessation
of the medication. bone resorption was assessed by
measuring n-terminal crosslinking telopeptide of
type i collagen (ntx) and c-terminal crosslinking
telopeptide of type i collagen (ctx) from urine
(second void after overnight fast). ntx
(osteomark-ntx, ostex international, usa) and
ctx (crosslabs elisa, osteomer biotech,
denmark) were measured by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay at medix diacor, finland. to
avoid the possible source of error due to different
urine dilutions, both ntx and ctx data are
expressed against mmol of creatinine, which was
assessed by a routine laboratory method. bone

formation was assessed by measuring the levels of
procollagen type i n propeptide (pinp), procollagen
type i c propeptide (picp), and bone-specific
alkaline phosphatase (bone alp) in serum after overnight fast. pinp and picp were measured by
radioimmunoassay (orion diagnostica, finland) at
medix diacor. bone alp was measured by immunoradiometric assay (hybritech, usa) at limbach,
germany. the intra- and interassay variability of
the assays were 8% and 10% for ntx, 10% and 16%
for ctx, 6% and 7% for pinp, 3% and 6% for picp,
and 7% and 7% for bone alp, respectively.

except for smoking, which was less common in the
90 mg  xxxd2798xxx  group (table 1). biochemical
bone marker levels at baseline did not differ between
the study groups (table 2). one subject who was
randomized to the placebo group did not start the
treatment, so the final number of analyzable subjects
was 159.
the urinary output of ntx decreased significantly during 3 months of  xxxd2798xxx  treatment,
by 6.1, 9.4 and 12.9% in the 30, 60 and 90 mg
 xxxd2798xxx  groups, respectively, whereas it increased
by 12.7% int he placebo group (table 2 and figure 1).
the urinary output of ctx decreased only in the
90 mg  xxxd2798xxx  group (4.8%), but this change
was significantly different from the placebo group,
in which ctx increased by 20.0% (table 2 and
figure 1).
the levels of pinp in serum were reduced
dose-dependently during 3 months of  xxxd2798xxx 
treatment. the falls in pinp were 9.8% in the 60 mg
 xxxd2798xxx  group (p < 0.05) and 15.3% in the 90 mg
 xxxd2798xxx  group (p < 0.01) (table 2 and figure 2).
the levels of picp decreased by 2.6, 12.0 and 11.9%
in the 30, 60 and 90 mg  xxxd2798xxx  groups, respectively, but also in the placebo group (8.7%), and
no differences between the study groups emerged
(table 2 and figure 2). the levels of bone alp
decreased in the 60 and 90 mg  xxxd2798xxx  groups by
1.9% and 2.6%, respectively, and both groups differed
significantly from the placebo group, in which bone
alp increased by 6.8% (table 2 and figure 2).
the effect of  xxxd2798xxx  was found to be
dose-dependent for all biochemical parameters
studied, except for picp (test for linearity, p = 0.02
for ntx, p = 0.02 for ctx, p = 0.00 for pinp and

statistical analysis
the primary approach in the statistical analyses was
intention to treat. the absolute changes from baseline at 3 months in ctx, pinp, picp and bone alp
were analyzed using an anova model. comparison
of each  xxxd2798xxx  dose level with placebo was performed by calculating contrasts of treatment means
generated by the anova model. for ntx, the
assumptions for parametric analysis did not hold, and
transformations did not improve on this. therefore
the absolute change from baseline in ntx was analyzed using the cochran–mantel–haenszel (cmh)
test. separate comparisons for each pair of groups
were made. for all bone markers, the dosedependency was tested by separating effects into a linear and a non-linear (‘lack-of-linear-fit’) component.

p = 0.03 for bone alp). within 2–4 weeks after
cessation of  xxxd2798xxx  treatment, there was a clear
increase in the levels of all bone markers (figures
1 and 2).
the changes in bone markers were unrelated to
patients’ age, time spent in menopause, body mass
index or smoking. however, the history of the use of
hrt was associated with larger increases in the
outputs of ntx and ctx in the placebo group
(14.8% vs 11.5% and 34.2% vs 3.3%, respectively).
also the effect of  xxxd2798xxx  was more evident in
the subgroup of subjects with previous use of hrt
(table 3).

discussion
 xxxd2798xxx  is a novel serm that is well
tolerated13,14 and has neutral or beneficial effects on
various vascular surrogate markers17. we assessed
here its effects on bone biochemistry. bone resorption and bone formation were examined with a
number of markers that have been widely used

for this purpose15,16,18,19. in the present study bmd
measurements were not performed and the subjects
were on average 57–58-year-old healthy postmenopausal women without any evidence of osteopenia
or osteoporosis.  xxxd2798xxx  clearly decreased the
urinary output of ntx, which is regarded as one
of the most reliable markers reflecting bone
resorption15,20,21. in contrast, ctx, another marker
of bone resorption, decreased significantly only in
the 90 mg  xxxd2798xxx  group. a clear increase in both
ntx (12.7%) and ctx (20.0%) was observed in the
placebo group, which is in concert with their
postmenopausal status. in a subgroup analysis it was
found that ntx and especially ctx outputs
increased more in women with a previous use of
hrt than in those with no previous use of hrt.
this may imply that bone degradation was perhaps
exaggerated in women who had previously used
hrt, even though 23 months on average had
elapsed since the cessation of hrt. also the fact that
calcium and vitamin d, which have beneficial effect
on bone turnover22, were not supplemented in the

study may have influenced the increase in the bone
resorption markers in the placebo group.
 xxxd2798xxx  reduced bone formation, as seen from
the significant decreases in the 60 and 90 mg groups
in pinp, which is regarded as one of the most reliable
markers of bone formation15. also bone alp data
indicate an inhibitory effect of  xxxd2798xxx  on bone
formation, as both 60 and 90 mg dose levels differed
significantly from placebo. the more pronounced
decrease in pinp when compared to the bone alp is
in line with the comparative studies, in which pinp
has been shown to react earlier than bone alp16. on
the other hand picp behaved differently and
decreased also in the placebo group. altogether, the
60 and 90 mg  xxxd2798xxx  doses were more effective
than the 30 mg dose in reducing the levels of bone
resorption and bone formation markers. as seen with
hrt treatment15, all bone markers started to return
to the baseline level 2–4 weeks after  xxxd2798xxx

months, whereas the decrease in bone formation

markers under hrt is delayed and a plateau is usually
achieved within 6–12 months. after the plateau in
the reduction of bone markers is reached with hrt,
it is maintained for the duration of the treatment15,16.
when postmenopausal women without osteoporosis
(55% were osteopenic) received raloxifene for 24
months, the median levels of serum osteocalcin and
bone alp, and urinary ctx decreased by 15.0%,
23.1% and 34.0%, respectively23. the reduction in
both ctx and osteocalcin levels continued up till
12 months23, suggesting that with raloxifene the
plateau is reached later than with estrogen. when
raloxifene was given to osteoporotic postmenopausal
women for 12 months, the reductions in bone
markers were more pronounced than in women
without osteoporosis (decrease in serum osteocalcin,
bone alp and urinary ctx of 33.1%, 36.0% and

35.9%, respectively)24. this demonstrates that the
more osteoporotic the bone is, the more pronounced
is the reduction in bone markers. therefore it is likely
that further reduction in bone markers is seen when
 xxxd2798xxx  is given to osteoporotic patients and for
longer time than allowed in the present 3-month
phase ii study.
we conclude that  xxxd2798xxx  at 30–90 mg daily
doses reduces bone turnover in healthy postmenopausal women. based on these results, further studies
with  xxxd2798xxx  in osteoporotic subjects and in
prevention of bone fractures are warranted.
