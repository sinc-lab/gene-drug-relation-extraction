[comparison of the affinities of  xxxd160xxx  and  xxxd2511xxx  for various receptors in rat brain and the receptor down-regulation after chronic administr...  using radioligand receptor binding methods, the affinities (ki) of  xxxd160xxx  and  xxxd2511xxx  for various receptors (adrenergic alpha 1, alpha 2, beta; dopaminergic d1, d2; serotoninergic 5-ht1, 5-ht2; muscarinic, gaba, bz) were investigated. the two compounds showed high affinities for 5-ht2, d2 and alpha 1 receptors (ki less than 10(-7) mol/l), moderate affinity for alpha 2 receptor (ki less than 10(-6) mol/l), and low affinities for m and 5-ht1 receptor (ki less than 10(-5) mol/l). in addition,  xxxd160xxx  appeared to have low affinities for d1 and gaba receptors. for  xxxg655xxx ,  xxxd2511xxx  was found to have moderate affinity which was nearly 20 fold greater than  xxxd160xxx , but  xxxd160xxx  exhibited more potent inhibitory effects on serotonin receptors and weaker inhibitory affects on dopamine receptors. neither  xxxd160xxx  nor  xxxd2511xxx  showed significant affinity for bz and beta-adrenergic receptors. these differences in the affinities may be responsible for their different psychopharmacological effects in the clinical treatment of patients. the regulation of 5-ht2 and beta receptors were examined in chronic experiments on rats given  xxxd160xxx  8 mg/kg or  xxxd2511xxx  1 mg/kg orally once daily for one to three weeks. the  xxxg1113xxx  density was time-dependently reduced but no effect on beta receptors was observed. the down-regulation of 5-ht2 receptors might be associated with antidepressant action of the two drugs.
