summary
synopsis

 xxxd2691xxx , a synthetic agonist ofgonadotrophin-releasing hormone (gnrh) {lutein ising
hormone-releasing hormone ( xxxg930xxx );  xxxd2226xxx ] appears likely to join the other gnrh
analogues currently used in a range of conditions reliant on gonadotrophins or sex hormones. with repeated administration. the pituitary becomes desensit ised, and gonadotrophin release. and therefore sex hormone synthesis. are inhibited.  xxxd2691xxx  has proved to
be comparable to  xxxd1806xxx  in the management of women with endometriosis. with fewer
potentially harmful adverse effects.  xxxd2691xxx  has also been used effectively in in vitro
fertilisation programmes. and in hirsute women and those with uterine leiomyoma. particularly to induce preoperative fibroid shrinkage.
the drug shrinks hypertrophic tissue in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. although treatment would need to be maintained indefinitely and therefore should probably
be reserved for those unsuitable for prostatectomy. preliminary data suggest that  xxxd2691xxx 
is equivalent to diethylstilbestrol ( xxxd1880xxx ) in terms ofdisease-free survival in men with
prostate cancer. as a reliable method ofcontraception.  xxxd2691xxx  gives unpredictable results
in men and the promising results in women may be offset by hypoestrogenic side effects.
nafareltn may join other gnrh agonists which are now routinely used in the management
of children with central or combined precocious puberty.
 xxxd2691xxx  is readily and rapidly absorbedfollowing intranasal delivery. and is protected
to some extent from enzymatic degradation. the resultant relatively long elimination half
life allows once- or twice-daily administration. estrogen depletion accounts for the mo st
common side effects associated with  xxxd2691xxx , including hot flush es and vaginal dryness .
which are mild and tolerable in most patients. reversible resorption of trabecular bone
can occur during  xxxd2691xxx  therapy. perhaps necessitating cyclical treatment to enable bone
mass to recover.
 xxxd2691xxx , therefore . looks likely to find a role in the treatment of women with endometriosis. and results achieved in other conditions dependent on the pituitary-gonadal axis
are promising.

pharmacodynamic properties

 xxxd2691xxx  is a synthetic analogue of gnrh and is about 200 times more potent than
the endogenous peptide . it stimulates the release of the gonadotrophins luteinising hormone (lh) and follicle stimulating hormone (fsh) from the anterior pituitary, but this
effect gradually wanes with multiple doses as the pituitary becomes desensitised, possibly
from down-regulation of receptors .
single intranasal or subcutaneous doses ofnafarelin elevate serum lh and fsh levels
in both sexes. the magnitude and rate of gonadotrophin release are greatest in women
during the late follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. after 2 or 3 days of
daily  xxxd2691xxx  administration, the pituitary becomes refractory, and lh and fsh release
is inhibited within 10 days. intermittent intramuscular administration of testosterone
enanthate 200mg enhances gonadotrophin suppression in healthy men. although variable
between individuals, pituitary desensitisation is proportional to  xxxd2691xxx  dosage. like
other gnrh agonists,  xxxd2691xxx  also appears to reduce the biological activity of lh.
in men , serum testosterone levels initially increase after subcutaneous administration

 xxxd2691xxx  : a review

525

of  xxxd2691xxx  10 to 200ltg, and then gradually decline to below baseline after 10 days.
spermatogenesis is suppressed by up to 92% during treatment with  xxxd2691xxx  200 or 400
ug/day subcutaneously plus concomitant fortnightly  xxxd3326xxx  200mg intramuscularly, although azoospermia is rare and unpredictable. sperm counts normalise
within 16 weeks of stopping  xxxd2691xxx .
in women, single intranasal doses of 125 or 5001tg, and i, 5 or iooltg subcutaneously,
increase mean serum estradiol levels by 2 to 4 times in a dose-proportional manner. the
greatest increases occur when  xxxd2691xxx  is given during the early follicular phase of the
cycle. peak estradiol release occurs after 2 weeks' admin istration , and then steadily decreases to pretreatment levels or lower. despite variable responses, mean progesterone
levels increase initially and then fall to pretreatment values after 10 days of daily  xxxd2691xxx 
administration during the luteal phase. levels of progesterone indicative of ovulation
have been detected in fewer than 18% of cycles during intranasal delivery of  xxxd2691xxx 
acetate 125 or 250 ltg/day for 3 to 6 months. with a twice-daily dosage of  xxxd2691xxx  5001tg,
progesterone release and ovarian testosterone synthesis appear to be completely inhibited .
single doses of  xxxd2691xxx  i, 5, 20 or 100itg given subcutaneously during the early
follicular phase lengthen the mean menstrual cycle duration and postpone ovulation .
amenorrhoea and oligomenorrhoea are common during 3 to 6 months' intranasal administration of  xxxd2691xxx  acetate 125 or 250 ltg/day, with ovulatory menses re-established
between 28 and 48 days after discontinuing the drug.
to summarise, single doses of  xxxd2691xxx  stimulate the release of lh and fsh, which
provokes sex steroid production. with repeated administration, the pituitary becomes
desensitised and gonadotrophin release is inhibited . the biological activity of lh may
also be altered . consequently, follicle maturation, ovulation and luteinisation are usually
prevented in women, resulting in reduced estrogen and progesterone synthesis, and in
men testosterone production and spermatogenesis are inhibited .
pharmacokinetic properties

 xxxd2691xxx  is a decapeptide and therefore susceptible to gastrointestinal peptidase degradation, making it unsuitable for oral administration.
mean peak  xxxd2691xxx  plasma concentrations (cmax), achieved within 5 to 60 minutes ,
were 13.6 itg/l after a single subcutaneous dose of  xxxd2691xxx  400ltg, and 0.1, 0.35 and
1.59 itg/l following intranasal doses of 84, 206 and 3361tg, respectively, in healthy men
and women. intranasal absorption is enhanced by using more concentrated solutions of
 xxxd2691xxx  and by including sodium  xxxd2218xxx  in the formulation . the mean bioavailability of  xxxd2691xxx  following intranasal administration is about 4 to 21%.  xxxd2691xxx  is
rapidly and extensively distributed to extravascular tissue in animals , despite about 80%
being bound to plasma proteins in vitro, principally to albumin .
six metabolites, together with the parent compound, accounted for 36% of the total
dose and 85% of urinary radioactivity after a subcutaneous dose of 14c- xxxd2691xxx  216ltg
in 3 healthy men. the major metabolites, each representing about 20%of the total urinary
activity , were the (5-10) hexapeptide amide and naphthylalanine. about half of the total
radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 19 to 44% in the faeces over 7 days. the
elimination half-life (t 'l2) is about 2 or 3 hours following intranasal delivery of  xxxd2691xxx 
and 4 or 5 hours after subcutaneous administration, longer than the t 'l2 of 30 minutes
for native gnrh as a result of  xxxd2691xxx  being more resistant to peptidase degradation .
a plasma concentration as low as 50 ng/l is needed for  xxxd2691xxx  to elicit a response
at the pituitary in some individuals. peak gonadotrophin levels in response to single doses
of  xxxd2691xxx  lagged about 2 to 3 hours behind the c max of the drug.

therapeutic use

 xxxd2691xxx  has been used successfully in both sexes in a range of conditions dependent
on the pituitary-gonadal axis.
in open small-scale trials,  xxxd2691xxx  20 to 1000 ltg/day admin istered subcutaneously
or intranasall y reduced the symptoms and signs of endometriosis within 3 months. more
importantly, 2 well-designed comparative studies each involving around 200 patients
revealed reductions in american fertility society severity scores of 43 to 49%, and similar

526

drugs 39 (4) 1990

improvements in symptom relief and ectopic tissue eradication in women receiving  xxxd2691xxx  200 or 400ltg twice daily intranasally, or  xxxd1806xxx  400mg twice daily or 20'omg 3
times daily orally for 6 months. over 70% of women in i study were symptom-free or
had only mild symptoms 6 months after stopp ing either drug.
in 10 women with uterine leiomyoma (fibroids), intranasal  xxxd2691xxx  800 ltg/day reduced uterine volume by 57% (mean) after 6 months, corresponding to a decrease in
estradiol levels. shrinkage of fibroids was variable, but nevertheless facilitated surgical
excision. since myomas increased in size again once  xxxd2691xxx  was stopped and ovarian
estrogen synthesis restored, myomectomy following preoperative shrinkage with  xxxd2691xxx 
may represent the optimum use for the drug in this setting.
inhibition of ovarian testosterone production by intranasal administration of  xxxd2691xxx  500ltgtwice daily for 6 months resulted in a clinical improvement in 6 hirsute women,
including 4 with polycystic ovary syndrome. the effects of the lower dose of 200ltgtwice
daily on ovarian volume and number of follicles in another ii patients with polycystic
ovary syndrome were inconsistent, and only modest improvements were achieved in the
hirsutism of 7 of the women.  xxxd2691xxx  400 ltg/day intranasally successfully suppressed
ovarian function in 53 women undergoing in vitro fertilisation. subsequent stimulation
of follicular development with menotropins [ xxxd2564xxx  (hmo)]
led to adequate follicle numbers, and 33 patients progressed to embryo transfer ; 10 pregnancies resulted.
in 9 men with benign prostatic hyperplasia, daily subcutaneous injections of  xxxd2691xxx 
acetate 400ltg suppressed circulating testosterone below castrate levels (about i nrnol/l)
and decreased mean prostate size by 25% after 4 months. obstructive and, to a lesser
extent, irritative symptoms were relieved, but urinary flow rate improved to a clinically
significant degree in only 3 men. virtually all the hypertrophic tissue returned when
 xxxd2691xxx  was stopped . thus, continued treatment would be necessary to maintain remission, and should be reserved for those patients unsuitable for prostatectomy .
although other onrh agonists are now accepted treatment for men with stage d2
prostatic carcinoma, data regarding the use ofnafarelin in such patients are limited. seven
of 9 men treated with daily subcutaneous injections of  xxxd2691xxx  400ltg responded according to national prostatic cancer project criteria, with a median time to disease progression of about 16 months and a median survival time of over 2 years. in a comparative
study, castrate testosterone levels were achieved in 60 recipients ofnafarelin acetate 300ltg
intranasally twice daily and in 65 men receiving diethylstilbestrol img orally 3 times
daily, with similar disease-freesurvival rates of 84% and 70%, respectively, after 6 months'
follow-up.
the contraceptive potential of 3 to 6 months of intranasal admin istration of  xxxd2691xxx 
acetate 125 or 250ltg once daily has been evaluated in groups of 8 to 25 healthy women.
overall, pregnancy was prevented during a total of 281 months when  xxxd2691xxx  was the
only contraceptive method used by 77 women. presumed ovulation was inhibited in over
81% of cycles during administration of the lower dose, and in at least 97% with the higher
dose. endometrial biopsy specimens generally revealed atrophic or weakly proliferative
tissue. bleeding patterns were disrupted and unpredictable during  xxxd2691xxx  treatment,
with amenorrhoea present in 40 to 60% of women receiving 125 ltg/day and in 10 to
87% with twice this dosage. ovulatory menses were usually re-established 30 to 45 days
after discontinuing  xxxd2691xxx .
 xxxd2691xxx  400, 800, 1200 or 1600 ltg/day, given as a single daily intranasal dose or in
3 divided doses, slowed the linear growth rate of small groups of children with central
or combined precocious puberty by 30 to 50%. suppression of secondary sexual characteristics was inconsistent.
adverse effects

the reduction in circulating estrogens accounts for the most frequently reported adverse effects of  xxxd2691xxx . hot flushes, usually mild and tolerable, were experienced by
38 to 65% of women receiving  xxxd2691xxx  acetate 250 ltg/day intranasally and by over 90%
with higher doses. women also reported reduced libido and vaginal dryness. in 10 men

527

 xxxd2691xxx  : a review

with benign prostatic hyperplasia receiving  xxxd2691xxx  400 jlg/day subcutaneously, hot flushes
and impotence were universal.
these troublesome, but not dangerous, unwanted effects occurred more frequently
with  xxxd2691xxx  than with  xxxd1806xxx  in women receiving treatment for endometriosis. however,  xxxd2691xxx  was associated with a lower incidence of weight gain, oedema, myalgia
and elevated serum liver enzymes than  xxxd1806xxx  and , unlike  xxxd1806xxx , was not associated
with undesirable changes in serum lipids.
trabecular bone mineral density decreased by 6 to ii % over a 6-month period of
therapy with  xxxd2691xxx  400 or 600 jlg/day, caused by increased bone resorption associated
with lower estrogen levels. most of this lost bone mass was recuperated on  xxxd2691xxx 
withdrawal, and appeared to be minimised by concomitant hormone replacement therapy.
nasal irritation has occasionally been reported following intranasal administration of
 xxxd2691xxx , as has headache and emotional lability. disease 'flare' associated with the short
term stimulation of gonadotrophin and sex hormone release at the beginning of therapy
does not appear to be common.
dosage and administration

since  xxxd2691xxx  is inactive if given orally, it is routinely administered intranasally or
occasionally subcutaneously.
twice daily intranasal application of 200 to 500jlg has been effective in women with
endometriosis, leiomyoma or hirsutism, and in men with prostatic carcinoma. subcutaneous injections of 400 jlg/day have also been used in prostate cancer patients and in
men with benign prostatic hypertrophy .
in female contraception, intranasal administration of  xxxd2691xxx  acetate 250 jlg/day
prevented ovulation almost completely, whereas a less predictable response was obtained
with i25jlg daily.
intranasal dosages ranging from 400 to l600jlg - but usually 25 jlg/kg given as a single
daily dose or in 3 divided doses - have been employed with generally favourable results
in children with central or combined precocious puberty.

a number of analogues of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (gnrh) [luteinising hormone-releasing hormone ( xxxg930xxx ) ;  xxxd2226xxx ] have been
synthesised since the structure of the endogenous
decapeptide was established in the early 1970s.
 xxxd2691xxx  [(d-nalz)6 gnrh] is an agonist
analogue in which the sixth amino acid (glycine)
ofgnrh is replaced by d-naphthylalanine (fig. 1),
rendering the molecule more hydrophobic. it
therefore possesses a high affinity for receptor proteins, with a ka value of 2.1 x 1010 at rat pituitary
receptors in vitro (vickery etal. 1985a). consequently ,  xxxd2691xxx  has been reported to be approximately 200 times more potent than gnrh in the
rat oestrus suppression assay (nestor et al. 1982).
normal reproductive function depends on the
pulsatile release of gnrh from the hypothalamus,
which induces pulses of the gonadotrophins luteinising hormone (lh) and follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh) from the anterior pituitary. in women,

fsh stimulates the granulosa cells of the graafian
follicleto produce estrogens, notably estradiol, from
androgens synthesised in the theca cells in response to lh. the midcycle estradiol peak leads
to a positive feedback-mediated surge in lh and,
to a lesser extent, fsh release (fig. 2). after ovulation, lh causes the ruptured follicle to develop
into the corpus luteum, which secretes the progesterone characteristic of the luteal phase of the cycle.
in men, lh promotes testosterone production in
the leydig cells of the testes which, only in the
presence of fsh, is responsible for sperm production in the seminiferous tubules.
if the normal pulsatile pattern of gnrh release
is overridden by the continuous presence ofgnrh
or one of its analogues, there is a desensitisation
of the pituitary to stimulation, thought to be due
to down-regulation of gnrh receptors, and gonadotrophin release is inhibited (belchetzet al. 1978;
vickery et al. 1985b).

some investigators, particularly in earlier studies, quantified doses of  xxxd2691xxx  in terms of the
acetate salt. since the decapeptide content of  xxxd2691xxx  acetate is typically about 80%, doses of 1000,
500, 250 and 125/-lg quantified as the acetate salt.
are comparable to 800, 400, 200 and 100/-lg of  xxxd2691xxx  free base. if unspecified, the dosage of  xxxd2691xxx  was assumed to be quantified as free base.

1. pharmacodynamic properties
the effects of  xxxd2691xxx  on the pituitary-gonadal
axis have been studied in small groups of healthy
men and women, after single doses and short to
medium term administration.

levels of lh peak within hours of  xxxd2691xxx 
administration in healthy men and women, with
fsh levels rising gradually.
following a single subcutaneous injection of  xxxd2691xxx  100 or 200/-lg in men, serum lh increased
from approximately 15 u/l of second international reference preparation to an initial peak of
40 to 70 u/l after i hour and a second of 60 to
80 u/l between 12 and 16 hours after administration (fig. 3) [bhasin et al. i985a,b; heber et al.
1984]. mean fsh levels increased gradually from
about 4 to 14 u/l of second international reference preparation 24 hours after  xxxd2691xxx  administration (heber et al. 1984).
in women with normal menstrual cycles, single
intranasal doses of  xxxd2691xxx  acetate 125 or 250/-lg
increased serum lh levels 8- to 10-fold, and fsh
levels 3- to 5-fold, peaking 4 hours after administration (brenner et al. 1985; chiang et al. 1985;

529

 xxxd2691xxx : a review

monroe et at. 1986). both the magnitude and the
rate of gonadotrophin release were greatest during
the late follicular (day 10 to 13) or luteal (day 15
to 25) phases of the menstrual cycle, and at a minimum in the early follicular (day 3 to 6) phase following single subcutaneous injections of  xxxd2691xxx 
i, 5, 20 or loo/lg in 28 women (monroe et al. 1985).
additionally, both basal lh and fsh serum levels,
as assessed by calculating the area under the plasma
concentration-time curves for 24 hours following
 xxxd2691xxx  administration (auco-24), increased in
proportion to dose during the early follicular phase.
however, in the later stages of the cycle, only a
correlation between serum lh and  xxxd2691xxx  i and
5/lg could be demonstrated. maximal gonadotrophin stimulation was achieved with  xxxd2691xxx  5/lg
during this period, since increasing the dosage of
 xxxd2691xxx  to 20 or 100/lg did not significantly increase the auco-24 of either lh or fsh (monroe
et al. 1985; schriock et al. 1985b).
with repeated daily administration of  xxxd2691xxx 
to men (fig. 4) and women , the stimulation of gonadotrophin release reaches a peak after 2 to 3 days,
declining as the pituitary gland becomes desensitised (bhasin et at. 1985b; brenner et al. 1985; heber et al. 1984; schriock et at. i 985b). after 10 days
of daily treatment with  xxxd2691xxx  10 or 100/lg subcutaneously, or intranasal delivery of 125 or 250/lg
of the acetate , lh and fsh release was not usually
stimulated above pretreatment levels in healthy
volunteers of both sexes (bhasin et at. 1984; bren::::r

ner et at. 1985; heber et at. 1984; schriock et at.
1985b). 24-hour fsh release was inhibited to below
baseline levels after subcutaneous administration
of  xxxd2691xxx  10 /lg/day for 10 days, or 20 or 200
/lg/day for 28 days in men (bhasin et at. 1984,
1985b). the mean auco-24 values for serum lh
following  xxxd2691xxx  10 and 100 /lg/day subcutaneously in 2 groups of 4 men were 96% lower on the
tenth day compared with the first day of treatment
(bhasin et at. 1984). although lh release was thus
diminished in comparison with the response to a
single dose of  xxxd2691xxx , serum levels were still
greater than those at baseline.
coadministration of testosterone in men further
reduces gonadotrophin release. a single intramuscular injection of  xxxd3326xxx  200mg on
the first day of  xxxd2691xxx  100/lg administration resulted in an overall inhibition oflh release (bhasin
et at. 1984). in the longer term , treatment with  xxxd2691xxx  200 /lyday subcutaneously for 16 weeks plus
testosterone 200mg intramuscularly every other
week reduced 24-hour lh and fsh release to below
baseline within 28 and 10 days, respectively, in 7

drugs 39 (4) 1990

men (bhasin et al. i985a). this suppression was
maintained throughout the study. the enhanced
gonadotrophin inhibition with comb ined therapy
would be expected, since testosterone regulates the
release of gonadotrophins, particularly lh, via a
negative feedback mechanism (griffin & wilson
1987).
in women, daily intranasal administration of
 xxxd2691xxx  acetate 125/lg decreased auc0-24 of lh
by about 60% and of fsh by 78% after 6 months
(brenner et al. 1985). the decline in release occurred predominantly in the first 3 months of  xxxd2691xxx  administration, but serum gonadotrophin
levels were still elevated compared with pretreatment values. monroe et al. (1986) demonstrated
that the lh and fsh surges which occurred 3 to
4 hours after single-dose  xxxd2691xxx  acetate administration were maintained to a lesser extent during
3 and 6 months' intranasal treatment with 125 and
250 /lgfday in 24 normally menstruating women.
thus, at these dosages, the pituitary gonadotrophs
were not completely desensitised, despite continuous exposure to the gnrh agonist. twice-daily
intranasal administration of  xxxd2691xxx  acetate 500jlg
to 8 women with endometriosis, however, abolished virtually all pituitary sensitivity within 3
months (monroe et al. 1986). the more frequent
administration schedule, as well as the increased
dosage, probably contributed to the more profound
inhibition of gonadotrophin release. variable individual response may also influence the degree of
inhibition. although once-daily intranasal administration of  xxxd2691xxx  acetate 125/lg reduced mean
basal lh release in 2 groups of 9 and 13 women
after 10 to 15 days of treatment, individual responses varied widely with marked lh suppression in some women and an almost normal release
profile in others (brenner et al. 1985; monroe et
al. 1986).
prolonged exposure to  xxxd2691xxx  may alter the
biological activity oflh as well as its release. after
4 months' daily administration of  xxxd2691xxx  200/lg
subcutaneously to 7 men, and 250/lg of the acetate
intranasally to 3 women , serum levels of biologically active lh decreased from 20.4 to 4.5 u/l
and from 48 to 15.7 u/l, respectively (bhasin et

al. 1985a; chiang et al. 1985). given the less profound reductions in immunogenic lh, the ratios
of biologically active to immunologically active lh
fell by 42 and 66%. intranasal treatment with  xxxd2691xxx  acetate 125 /lg/day in 4 women was associated with a nonsignificant decrease in the bioactive species from 60.6 to 44 u/l (chiang et al.
1985). substantial reduction of lh bioactivity has
been reported with other gnrh agonists (evans et
al. 1984), and also appears to' hold true for  xxxd2691xxx .
1.2 effect on sex hormones

1.2.1 studies in men
serum testosterone levels in men initially rise
following  xxxd2691xxx  administration, but decline
thereafter. single subcutaneous injections of  xxxd2691xxx  10 or 100/lg to 2 groups of 7 healthy men gradually increased serum testosterone, with levels 30%
greater than baseline reached within 16 to 24 hours
(heber et al. 1984). after 3 to 4 days of continued
daily administration of  xxxd2691xxx  10 to 200/lg, basal
serum testosterone levels doubled and then steadily declined to baseline or below after 10 days
(bhasin et al. 1984, 1985b; heber et al. 1984).continuous infusion, via a portable pump, appeared
more effective than repeated daily subcutaneous
injections of  xxxd2691xxx  200/lg in suppressing testosterone release, as evidenced by respective mean
basal testosterone levels after 28 days of 7.4 and
17.7 nmol/l in 2 groups of 5 men (bhasin et al.
1985b). however, the difference was not statistically significant, probably reflecting the small number of subjects.
testosterone secretion is regulated by lh, which
in tum is governed by the negative feedback effects
of testosterone. thus, coadministration of  xxxd2691xxx  and exogenous testosterone should suppress androgen synthesis synergistically.  xxxd2691xxx  with
concomitant intramuscular administration of  xxxd3326xxx  200mg every 2 weeks or as a
single injection reduced serum testosterone levels
to at least pretreatment values after 10 to 14 days
(bhasin et al. 1984, 1985a,b). however, compared
with a fall to 46% of control levels after 10 days'

531

 xxxd2691xxx : a review

daily administration of  xxxd2691xxx  1o~g to 4 men,
addition of a 'single dose of testosterone 200mg at
the beginning of  xxxd2691xxx  treatment resulted in a
serum testosterone level 161% of the baseline value
in the same group (bhasin et aj. 1984).
the increase in serum testosterone in response
to human  xxxd2228xxx , which has a
direct stimulatory action on the leydig cells, was
maintained after 10 days' administration of  xxxd2691xxx  10 or 100 ~g/day in 14 healthy men (heber et
al. 1984). the inhibition of testosterone release by
 xxxd2691xxx  therefore appears to be mediated through
a decrease in circulating lh rather than a direct
effect on the testes, at least in the short term.

1.2.2 studies in women
estrogens
in healthy women, plasma estradiol levels
peaked 8 to 13 hours after single intranasal or subcutaneous doses of  xxxd2691xxx  acetate i to 250~g
(brenner et al. 1985; monroe et al. 1985).the magnitude of the increase was related to the dosage of
 xxxd2691xxx  and was dependent on the menstrual cycle
phase, with the largest increases seen during the
early follicular phase. plasma estradiol levels increased by around 140% 8 to 12 hours after intranasal administration of 125~g to 9 women during
this phase and by 320%after a 250~g dose (brenner
et al. 1985). similarly, increases oÂ£18, 180and 288%
occurred following single subcutaneous injections
of  xxxd2691xxx  '1, 5 and 100~g (monroe et al. 1985).
a peak plasma estradiol level of 853 pmol/l following a 1oo~g dose of  xxxd2691xxx  in the early follicular phase was indeed comparable to the normal
preovulatory peak of 1043 pmol/l in 4 women
(monroe et aj. 1985).
subcutaneous injections of  xxxd2691xxx  acetate 1,
5 and 1oo~g increased plasma estradiol levels by
262, 108 and 186% compared with control values
during the late follicular phase, and by 60, 164 and
33%in the luteal phase (monroe et aj. 1985). these
seemingly disparate increases are probably a result
of considerable interindividual variability in response to  xxxd2691xxx  , exacerbated by groups comprising only 1 to 4 women.

(1986Â»).

ovarian estrogen production in response to  xxxd2691xxx  gradually diminishes with continued treatment in relation to dose. in 19 women receiving
 xxxd2691xxx  acetate 125 or 250 ~gjday intranasally,
the daily peaks in plasma estradiol levels were 75%
and 175%, respectively, after 3 months and 50%
and 20% by the sixth month, compared with initial
peaks of around 140% and 320% (brenner et aj.
1985). monroe et aj. (1986) demonstrated that the
increase in plasma estradiol in response to  xxxd2691xxx  acetate after 3 and 6 months was inversely proportional to the dose ofnafarelin; 125 ~gjday caused
only a slight decline in peak estradiol response,
whereas 500~g twice daily abolished any increase.
examination of plasma estradiol levels revealed
that estradiol production in response to an elevation in circulating gonadotrophins was greatest after
2 weeks of intranasal administration of  xxxd2691xxx 
acetate 125 or 250 ~gjday, and then declined rapidly to pretreatment levels within 1 month of
commencing treatment (fig. 5) [gudmundsson et
aj. 1986; monroe et al. 1986].
progesterone
the profile of circulating progesterone during a
normal menstrual cycle is depicted in figure 2.
during the luteal phase, mean serum progesterone

532

levels increased by between 73 and iii % 6 to 8
hours after a single subcutaneous injection of  xxxd2691xxx  100j.lg in 6 healthy women (monroe et al.
1985; schriock et al. 1985b). comparable increases, with maximal levels of 70.4 to 79.4 nmol/
l, representing about twice the baseline values, also
occurred after single subcutaneous doses of i, 5 or
20j.lg in 2, 3 and i women, respectively (monroe
et al. 1985). although these increases in progesterone release do not appear to be dose-related, the
very small study groups make any association difficult to establish. after 10 days of subcutaneous
treatment with  xxxd2691xxx  100 j.lg/day during the early
(starting 2 to 3 days after ovulation) or midluteal
phase (commencing after 5 to 7 days), the mean
plasma progesterone level of 6 women was unaltered compared with pretreatment values (schriock
et al. 1985b). individual responses varied, with levels falling in 4 women and rising in 2.
perhaps of more importance are the effects of
 xxxd2691xxx  given intranasally, a route of administration more acceptable for medium to long term use
than daily subcutaneous injections. progesterone
levels of at least 12.7, 15.9 or 20 nrnol/l, each of
which was taken to be indicative of ovulation by
different investigators (see also sections 1.3.2 and
3.3), occurred in 10 of 54 cycles in 9 women (brenner et al. 1985), 4 of 73 cycles in another 13 (monroe et al. 1986) and in only i cycle out of 142 in
25 more (gudmundsson et al. 1986) during intranasal administration of  xxxd2691xxx  acetate 125 j.lg/
day. luteinisation of follicles, but without subsequent ovulation, as shown by plasma progesterone
between roughly 6.25 and 12.5 nmol/l, occurred
in 7 of 73 treatment months in 13 women and in
6 of 142 cycles in another group of 25 receiving
this dosage (gudmundsson et al. 1986; monroe et
al. 1986). during intranasal administration of a
higher dosage of 250 j.lg/day, progesterone levels
within this range occurred during only 2 of 58 cycles
in ii women (monroe et al. 1986), and levels indicative of ovulation were either not apparent
(gudmundsson et al. 1986; monroe et al. 1986) or
occurred in only 2 cycles out of 60 in 10 women
(brenner et al. 1985). progesterone plasma levels
were consistently below 6.25 nmol/l in 8 women

drugs 39 (4) 1990

who received 500j.lg  xxxd2691xxx  acetate intranasally
twice daily for a total of 44 months, indicating profound suppression of luteal activity with this regimen (monroe et al. 1986).
thus, it appears that there is still sufficient circulating lh to stimulate the corpus luteum to produce progesterone after administration of  xxxd2691xxx 
100 j.lg/day subcutaneously or 125 j.lg/day of the
acetate intranasally in some women, although normal postovulatory levels are rarely achieved. due
to the wide variation in individual response , both
of the gonadotroph to  xxxd2691xxx  and of the corpus
luteum to lh stimulation, suppression of progesterone synthesis with these dosages may not occur.
inhibition ofluteal progesterone production is more
consistent with higher dosages.
androgens
androgen production in women is also decreased by  xxxd2691xxx . mean serum levels of testosterone and androstenedione were slightly, but significantly, reduced after 6 months' treatment with
 xxxd2691xxx  acetate 250 j.lg/day in ii women , and decreased by around 50% in another 8 who received
1000 ltg/day (monroe et al. 1986). since these androgens are derived approximately equally from the
adrenal glands and from the lh-stimulated ovaries, it appeared that the higher dose of  xxxd2691xxx 
virtually abolished the ovarian component and
preserved the adrenal contribution. this was also
demonstrated by a lack of effect on circulating levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, an indicator of adrenal androgen secretion only.
1.3 effect on reproductive function

1.3.1 studies in males
in animal studies, the dog is the model of choice
for studying the effects of  xxxd2691xxx  on spermatogenesis, since previous work with other gnrh
agonists revealed that the responses of this species
were comparable to those of men (vickery &
mcrae 1984). daily subcutaneous injections of  xxxd2691xxx  acetate 0.5, 2 and 10 j.lg/kg in male dogs
reduced semen volume, testicular volume, sperm
count and motility (vickery 1981 b; vickery et al.

 xxxd2691xxx : a review

1985b). inhibition of spermatogenesis was apparent after 10 days' administration of the 2 higher
doses, and ejaculation was abolished after 28 to 42
days. the seminiferous tubules were aspermatogenic, containing only sertoli cells and germinal
elements. most parameters began to recover soon
after cessation of  xxxd2691xxx  administration, but
sperm count continued to decline, reaching a 98%
nadir 24 days after the last injection of the 10 /lg/
kg dose (vickery 1981b). a normal count was
achieved 3 weeks later, well after plasma testosterone level and ejaculate volume were restored.
addition of a subcutaneous testosterone implant re-established sperm motility and maturity,
and ejaculate volume - although reduced - was
maintained. nevertheless, azoospermia occurred,
about a week after it did with  xxxd2691xxx  alone
(vickery 1981b).
from these promising results in animals, and
since supplemental testosterone further inhibits
gonadotrophin release (see section l.l) while maintaining potency ,  xxxd2691xxx  in human studies has
been coadministered with 2-weekly intramuscular
injections of  xxxd3326xxx  200mg. in 7
healthy men , once-daily subcutaneous injections of
 xxxd2691xxx  200/lg for 16 weeks, together with testosterone, lowered the mean sperm count from 120.8
x 106/ml to a nadir of 16.6 x 106/ml up to 2 weeks
after treatment was stopped (bhasin et at. 1985a).
the oligospermia was reversible , with counts normalising 10 to 16 weeks after the last dose of  xxxd2691xxx . although the sperm count was 10 x 106/
ml or fewer in 4 men (less than 1 x 106/rnl in 1
subject) , another had a count of 45 x 106/mt.
complete azoospermia was not achieved in any
men administered this regimen.
however, sperm production was suppressed to
a greater extent by  xxxd2691xxx  400 /lg/day given as a
continuous subcutaneous infusion via a portable
pump, plus fortnightly testosterone (swerdloff et
at. 1985). after 16 weeks' treatment with this regimen , the mean sperm count of 7 men decreased
by 92% to 6.1 x 106/mt. values were below 5 x
106/ml in 5 subjects, 4 of whom had counts below
1 x 106/ml including 3 who were azoospermic.
again, the effects were reversible with restoration

533

of normal sperm counts within 16 weeks of  xxxd2691xxx  discontinuation.
as well as the higher dosage, the method of administering  xxxd2691xxx  as a continuous infusion could
well have contributed to the greater suppression of
sperm production with this regimen compared with
repeated once-daily injections of 200/lg. commencing concomitant androgen administration once
azoospermia has been achieved with  xxxd2691xxx  may
give the full contraceptive effect while maintaining
potency in men (see review by filicori & f1amigni
1988).

1.3.2 studi es in females
repeated administration of  xxxd2691xxx  suppressed ovulation in dogs, rhesus monkeys and baboons (mcrae et at. 1985; vickery et at. 1985a)
and shortened the luteal phase of the menstrual
cycle (vickery 1981a). in pregnant animals, the effects of  xxxd2691xxx  on luteal phase duration were negated by circulating chorionic gonadotrophins
which maintained the functional corpus luteum
(mcrae et at. 1985).
the individual ovulatory responses of healthy
normally menstruating women to  xxxd2691xxx  differ
considerably, reflecting the variability in response
to the drug's effects on serum gonadotrophins and
sex hormones (see sections l.l and 1.2).
single subcutaneous doses of  xxxd2691xxx  acetate
i, 5, 20 or 100/lg significantly prolonged the mean
cycle duration in ii women by 4 days and delayed
ovulation by about 5 days when given in the early
follicular phase (monroe et at. 1985). the length
of the overall cycle and of the luteal phase were
both shortened following the same dosage administered in the late luteal phase to 5 other women.
however, single doses of  xxxd2691xxx  had little effect
on cycle length or ovulation when given shortl y
before or after ovulation.
during longer term once daily intranasal
administration of  xxxd2691xxx  acetate 125 /lyday for
3 to 6 months, ovulation was presumed to have
occurred in fewer than 18% of cycles, based on
serum progesterone levels (see section 1.2.2) [brenner et at. 1985; gudmundsson et at. 1986; monroe
et at. 1986]. ovulation was usually completel y sup-

drugs 39 (4) 1990

534

pressed at twice this dosage (gudmundsson et al.
1984, 1986; monroe et al. 1986), but was nevertheless documented in 2 of 60 months in 1 group
of 10 women (brenner et al. 1985). luteinisation,
without ovulation, was also less frequent with  xxxd2691xxx  acetate 250 and 1000 ~gjday (gudmundsson et al. 1986; monroe et al. 1986).
amenorrhoea was apparent in 8 of 25 and 5 of
12 women after 3 months' treatment with  xxxd2691xxx 
acetate 125 ~gjday intranasally, and in 2 and 7,
respectively, from 2 groups of 8 women receiving
250 ~gjday (gudmundsson et al. 1986; monroe et
al. 1986). in the latter half of a 6-month study,
amenorrhoea became more frequent, occurring in
15 of 22 recipients of 125 ~gjday and in 6 of 7
women receiving 250~g daily (gudmundsson et al.
1986). if menstrual bleeding did occur, each woman
experienced 2 to 6 episodes throughout 6 months'
administration of 125 ~g/day of the acetate, and 2
to 4 with the daily dose of 250~g (brenner et al.
1985; gudmundsson et al. 1986). each episode
lasted between 3.5 and 4.5 days, with a mean interval (i.e. cycle length) of about 30 days with the
lower dose and 36 to 46 days with 250 ~gjday
(brenner et al. 1985; gudmundsson et al. 1986).
endometrial histology revealed atrophic or slightly
proliferative tissue after 6 months of treatment
(gudmundsson et al. 1986, 1987a; monroe et al.
1986). the return to a normal menstrual cycle varied between 28 and 44 days after discontinuation
of  xxxd2691xxx  acetate 125 ~gjday, and from 34 to 48
days after 250~g daily (brenner et al. 1985; monroe
et al. 1986).
 xxxd2691xxx  acetate therefore suppressed the cyclical ovulation, bleeding patterns and changes in
endometrial histology in healthy women, particularly at daily dosages of 250 ~g/day and above.
1.4 mechanism of action
the effects of repeated  xxxd2691xxx  administration
on pituitary' gonadotrophin secretion and the subsequent alterations in sex hormones and reproductive function are summarised in figure 6.
when  xxxd2691xxx  is given for about 3 days or less,
particularly during the late follicular or luteal phases

of the menstrual cycle, it acts as a 'superagonist' of
gnrh by increasing gonadotrophin release by up
to 10 times (see section 1.l). rapid desensitisation
of the anterior pituitary ensues with further  xxxd2691xxx  administration, probably either through desensitisation, where activated gnrh receptors are uncoupled from mediators of intracellular processes,
or through down-regulation, where the population
of gnrh receptors on the cell is decreased (barbieri 1990a; belchetz et al. 1978). basal gonadotrophin levels decline to pretreatment values and
below within around 10 days and are maintained
at this level for up to 6 months (brenner et ai. 1985).
concomitant 2-weekly testosterone intramuscular
administration in men causes further gonadotrophin inhibition, via a negative feedback mechanism to the anterior pituitary (bhasin et al. 1985a).
additionally, the depleted levels of lh appear to
be less biologically active during  xxxd2691xxx  administration (bhasin et al. 1985a; chiang et al. 1985).
in men, the decrease in circulating gonadotrophins, particularly during simultaneous  xxxd2691xxx 
plus testosterone treatment, inhibits lh-stimulated testosterone production in the leydig cells of
the testes (bhasin et al. 1984, 1985b; heber et al.
1984) and partial, but not complete, inhibition of
fsh and testosterone-driven sperm formation in
the seminiferous tubules (bhasin et ai. 1985a). in
women, the fsh peak associated with a normal
menstrual cycle is diminished, and follicular development is suppressed. consequently, synthesis
of estradiol, which occurs in the granulosa of the
mature follicle, is inhibited. serum estradiol levels
are comparable to pretreatment values within 1
month (gudmundsson et al. 1986; monroe et al.
1986).
in the absence of an lh surge and a developed
follicle, ovulat ion is often abolished by  xxxd2691xxx ,
particularly with daily intranasal dosages of the
acetate above 125~g (brenner et al. 1985; gudmundsson et al. 1984, 1986; monroe et al. 1986).
luteinisation, and thus production of progesterone
by the corpus luteum, is also usually inhibited by
 xxxd2691xxx  because of the reduced levels of lh
(gudmundsson et al. 1986; monroe et al. 1986).
however, in the presence of chorionic gonadotro-

phin the corpus luteum and progesterone synthesis
are preserved.
it must be emphasised, however, that there is
considerable interindividual variability in the ability of  xxxd2691xxx  to desensitise the pituitary gonadotroph, the basic action on which all its other effects depend . further heterogeneity is introduced
with the individual responses to gonadatrophins
and sex hormones.

2. pharmacokinetic properties
 xxxd2691xxx , a decapeptide, is inactivated when
given orally due to degradation by intestinal proteolytic enzymes (sanders et al. 1984b). thus, its
disposition and metabolic fate have been studied
in animals and humans following administration
via other routes, notably intranasally and subcutaneously. a specific radioimmunoassay was used
to detect  xxxd2691xxx  in serum or plasma, with a limit

of sensitivity of 30 to 50 ng/l (monroe et al. 1985;
nerenberg et al. 1984).
2.1 absorption and plasma concentration
an injectable substained release formulation of
 xxxd2691xxx , employing microencapsulation in the
biodegradable polymer poly(d./-iactide-co-glycolide), has been developed (kent et al. 1984;sanders
et al. 1984a,b). however, the release characteristics
of  xxxd2691xxx  from this formulation have only been
studied in animals, and these data cannot be extrapolated meaningfully to humans.
in healthy men and women, peak serum concentrations (cmax), achieved within 5 to 60 minutes (t max), were 0.2 to 0.6 ~gfl after a subcutaneous injection of  xxxd2691xxx  5~g, 3 to 6 ~gfl after
100~g and 13.6 ~gfl after an injection of 400~g
(chan et al. 1988; henzl et al. 1983; monroe et al.
1985;schriock et al. 1985b). the wide range in t max
is a reflection of interindividual variability, com-

drugs 39 (4) 1990

536

pounded by study groups of only 3 to 12 subjects.
this is further exemplified by 3 volunteers failing
to achieve detectable serum concentrations (50 ng/
l) of  xxxd2691xxx  after a single 5~g subcutaneous injection (chan et at. 1988). the area under the serum
concentration-time curve (auco_o,,) was 1.39 ~g/
l' hand 49.2 ~g/l ' h after subcutaneous injections of 5~g and 400~g, respectively.
subcutaneous administration may not, however, be acceptable to some patients for daily long
term treatment and thus other routes have also been
explored.  xxxd2691xxx  was not detected in the serum
of 5 women following intravaginal administration
of 500~g, or in 2 men and 4 women given 3 sublingual formulations of a 100~g dose (chan et at.
1988).
of more interest clinically is  xxxd2691xxx  absorption following intranasal administration. the t max
seems to be slightly shorter than with the subcutaneous route, ranging from 5 to 40 minutes (chan
et at. 1988; henzl et at. 1983). groups of 4 or 6
women received actual single intranasal doses of
84~g as a solution of  xxxd2691xxx  0.625 mg/ml, 206~g
as a 1.25 mg/ml solution or 336~g as 2.5 mg/ml
(chan et at. 1988). the corresponding c max values
were 0.1,0.35 and 1.59 ~g/l, with auco_4 of 0.07,
0.58 and 2.15 ~g/l' h. the increases in absorption
were not proportional to dosage increments, reflecting instead the concentration of  xxxd2691xxx  in
the administered solution. the enhanced mucosal
penetration achieved with more concentrated  xxxd2691xxx  solutions was further demonstrated by the
mean c ma x values of 0.13 and 0.6 ~g/l, respectively , achieved after 6 men received solutions
containing  xxxd2691xxx  0.625 and 2.5 mg/ml, despite
comparable total doses of 136 and 131~g (chan et
at. 1988). inclusion of 2% sodium  xxxd2218xxx  in
the formulation also improved absorption, with 10and 7-fold increases in c max and auc values, respectively, compared with the same concentration
lacking the surfactant (fig. 7) [chan et at. 1988;
hottman et at. 1987]. indeed, mean c max was approximately 5 ~g/l after administration of  xxxd2691xxx  350~g as a 1.75 mg/ml solution containing 2%
sodium  xxxd2218xxx , compared with about 2 ~g/l
after 500~g of a standard formulation of  xxxd2691xxx

1987).

2.5 mg/ml (chan et at. 1988). this formulation of
1.75 mg/rnl  xxxd2691xxx  plus 2% sodium  xxxd2218xxx 
was the optimum in terms of intranasal absorption, even though the c max value after a 350~g dose
was about 3 times lower than that after a subcutaneous injection of 400~g.
the mean bioavailability of  xxxd2691xxx  administered intranasally was 4 to 21% relative to subcutaneous and intravenous doses, reaching as low
as 2% in 1 individual and up to 37% in another
(chan et at. 1988; hottman et at. 1987).
2.2 distribution
the distribution of  xxxd2691xxx  to various tissues
has been studied both in vivo and in vitro.
the apparent volume of distribution following
intravenous administration of 6.4 to 73.5 ~g/kg of
3h_ or 14c- xxxd2691xxx  acetate was 0.38 to 0.47 l'kg
in monkeys, ind icating extensive extravascular dis-

 xxxd2691xxx : a review

tribution (chu et al. 1985). distribution was also
rapid , since 5 minutes after intravenous administration of 14c- xxxd2691xxx  acetate 100~g in rats, peak
radioactiv ity was detected in almost all organs, with
15%of the dose in the liver, 6% in the kidneys and
2% in the lungs (chu et al. 1985). maximum concentrations of radioactivity in the intestine occurred 2 hours after administration, probably due
to the presence of  xxxd2691xxx  metabolites in the bile.
the high affinity of  xxxd2691xxx  for extravascular
tissues appears to occur despite extensive plasma
protein binding. in vitro, 78 to 84% of 10- 8 to.
10- 5 moi/l solutions of 3h- xxxd2691xxx  acetate was
bound in human, rhesus monkey and rat plasma
(chan & chaplin 1985a). this compared with about
25% for native gnrh.  xxxd2691xxx  was 30 to 40%
bound to 10% plasma, but less than 5% bound in
albumin-free 10% plasma, indicating that albumin
was the principal binding protein (chan & chaplin
1985a).

the most common metabolites were the (5-10)
hexapeptide amide and naphthylalanine, comprising 22 and 20%, respectively, of radioactivity recovered in the urine from 3 men (fig. 8) [chan et
al. 1988]. the major species, the (5-10) hexapeptide amide , appears to be a key intermediate in the
formation of the other metabolites. it arises through
cleavage of the ser4-tyr 5 bond, a process known
to occur with endogenous gnrh in the kidney
(stetler-stevenson et al. 1981), and is then probably the subject of slow aminopeptidase action at
tyr5-(d-nai2)6. free naphthylalanine could then
be produced through peptidase degradation, which
in turn may generate 2- xxxd1338xxx  through
 xxxd2112xxx  (fad)-dependent damino acid oxidase activity (chan & chaplin
1985b).
2.3.2 excretion
 xxxd2691xxx  and 6 of its metabolites accounted for
36% of a total subcutaneous dose of 14c- xxxd2691xxx 
216/lg, and 85% of the urinary radioactivity, in 3

537

men (chan et al. 1988). over the 7 days following
administration, 44 to 55% of the radioactivity was
recovered in the urine and 19 to 44% in the faeces,
with most excretion occurring within 48 hours
(chan et al. 1988).
the elimination half-life (t'l2) of  xxxd2691xxx  in
healthy men and women was typically about 2 to
2.7 hours following subcutaneous or intranasal
administration (chan et al. 1988; henzl et al. 1983;
hoffman et al. 1987). the slow terminal phase of
elimination after an intranasal dose was preceded
by a more rapid distribution phase of about 1 hour,
to give an overall half-life of 3 to 4 hours in some
subjects (henzl et al. 1983; vickery et al. 1985a).
a plasma half-life of 4 to 5 hours has been reported
following subcutaneous  xxxd2691xxx  administration,
with the drug still detectable (~ 30 ng/l) in plasma
3 to 12 hours after a 5/lg dose and 24 to 36 hours
after an injection of 100/lg (monroe et al. 1985;
schriock et al. 1985b). xxxd2691xxx  is eliminated much
more slowly than native gnrh, which has a t'l2of
about 30 minutes in humans following intravenous
administration (jeffcoate et al. 1974). the longer
t'l2 of  xxxd2691xxx  is !1 result of its decreased susceptibility to peptidase degradation compared with
gnrh (chu et al. 1985). this is due to the substituted d-naphthylalanine residue imparting both
intrinsic resistance to breakdown and enhanced
lipophilicity leading to a greater degree of plasma
protein binding (see section 2.2) and thus protection from enzyme activity (chan & chaplin 1985a;
chu et al. 1985).
2.4 relationship between plasma
concentrations and effects on
gonadotrophins
in the short term ,  xxxd2691xxx  was detected in the
plasma (concentrations ~ 50 ng/l) of 12 volunteers 2 to 5 minutes after single intranasal doses of
125, 250 or 500~g, with elevation of lh plasma
levels occurring within 5 to 10 minutes (henzl et
al. 1983). although  xxxd2691xxx  was undetectable in
the plasma after 60/lg intranasally, lh release was
still stimulated 3-fold above baseline. a plasma na-

farelin concentration as low as 50 ng/l is therefore
sufficient in some individuals to acutely enhance
lh release.
with single subcutaneous injections of 5to
100jlg, peak serum levels of lh and fsh lagged
about 2 to 3 hours behind the cmax of  xxxd2691xxx 

(monroe et al. 1985; schriock et al. 1985b). increasing the aucq-4 ofnafarelin from 0.26 to 1.89
jlgfl â¢ h after a 100jlg intranasal dose by adding
sodium  xxxd2218xxx  to the formulation (see section 2.1) also caused the auc0-4 oflh to rise from
98 to 184 jlgflÂ· h (hoffman et al. 1987).

 xxxd2691xxx  : a review

3. therapeutic use
because of its effects on gonadotrophins, sex
hormones and reproductive function, continuous
treatment with  xxxd2691xxx  offers a means to treat
patients with hormone-dependent conditions , both
benign (e.g. endometriosis, uterine leiomyoma, hirsutism and prostatic hypertrophy) and malignant
(e.g. prostatic cancer). like other gnrh agonists,
 xxxd2691xxx  has potential in the treatment of precocious puberty and, to a lesser extent, as a method
of contraception for both men and women. in men,
studies have concentrated on sperm counts rather
than the clinical application of ability to impregnate . these investigations are considered in section
1.3.1 and will not be discussed further.
studies investigating the efficacyof  xxxd2691xxx  are
few. those in endometriosis and prostate cancer
involve larger populations, are well-controlled and
comparative, and thus an evaluation of  xxxd2691xxx 
in these conditions is possible. the contraceptive
application of the drug has been studied in a relatively large number of women each treated for up
to 6 months, but has not been directly compared
with other methods of fertility control.  xxxd2691xxx  's
efficacy in women with uterine leiomyoma and
hirsutism, in men with benign hypertrophic prostate and in sexually precocious children has been
assessed in small patient numbers participating in
open studies . the potential benefit of  xxxd2691xxx 
therapy in these. settings is therefore more difficult
to deduce, but general trends may be identified .
3.1 treatment of endocrine-sensitive
nonmalignant conditions

3.1.1 endometriosis
endometriosis, a painful benign condition occurring in about 5% of women of reproductive age,
is characterised by the presence of extrauterine
endometrial tissue or implants, thought to develop
through retrograde menstruation into the peritoneal cavity (barbieri 1988, 199oc; halme et al. 1984).
treatment of women with endometriosis aims to
suppress ovarian synthesis of the circulating estro-

539

gens responsible for continued proliferation of ectopic tissue.
subcutaneous or intranasal administration of
 xxxd2691xxx  20 to 1000jlgjday for 6 months improved
laparoscopic findings ofendometriosis in groups of
7 to 11 women in noncomparative trials, as assessed by the american fertility society (afs) disease classification (brzyski & comite 1987; lyles
et al. 1985; schriock et al. 1985a). in 7 women
completing treatment with  xxxd2691xxx  500jlg intranasally twice daily, the mean afs score remained
within the range judged to be indicative of moderate disease severity, but fell from a baseline value
of 14.1 to 9.6 (schriock et al. 1985a). endometrial
implants (mean pretreatment number of 5 per
patient) completely resolved in 5 women, as confirmed by laparoscopy. in the other 2 patients, the
number of implants was reduced from 7 to 4 and
from 3 to 1.
as well as improving laparoscopic findings, the
symptoms of disease were substantially attenuated
in all patients by  xxxd2691xxx , as illustrated by a reduction from 5.6 to 1.9 in the mean score on an
arbitrary scale based on the degree of pelvic pain,
dysmenorrhoea and dyspareunia (schriock et al.
1985a). improvement usually occurred within the
first month of therapy, reaching an optimum after
3 months. the attenuation of symptoms was paralleled by a fall in serum estradiol level to below
110 pmol/l in all women after i month, following
an initial transient period of stimulation. amenorrhoea was established in all 7 women, and thus
seeding of viable endometrial fragments via retrograde menstruation into the peritoneal cavity was
also prevented.
these promising preliminary results prompted
2 randomised, double-blind trials comparing the
efficacy of  xxxd2691xxx  400 or 200jlg twice daily intranasally with that of orally administered  xxxd1806xxx 
400mg twice daily or 200mg 3 times daily for up
to 6 months (henzl 1989; henzl et al. 1988; rolland & van der heijden 1990; rolland et al. 1989).
the results from these studies (table i) showed that
each  xxxd2691xxx  and  xxxd1806xxx  regimen was of similar
efficacy in reducing laparoscopically determined
mean afs severity scores, ameliorating symptoms

by 43 or 49% in those women receiving  xxxd1806xxx 
(fig. 9).
both  xxxd2691xxx  regimens and  xxxd1806xxx  400mg
twice daily were also effective in more advanced
disease. in women with afs stage iii endometriosis, the reduction in mean severity score was
55% in 22 women receiving higher-dose  xxxd2691xxx ,
33% for the lower dosage in 23 others and 36% in
22  xxxd1806xxx  recipients (henzl et al. 1988). corresponding values in 10, 10 and 9 women from each
group with stage iv disease were 30, 48 and 41%,
respectively. one woman from each group with
stage iii or iv disease achieved a complete remission in this study.
although the difference was not statisticaliy significant,  xxxd2691xxx  800 jlg/day tended to be more
effective than the lower dose regimen, inducing a
complete resolution in 20% of women compared
with 8% of those receiving 400 jlg/day (henzl et
al. 1988). however, this lower dose of  xxxd2691xxx 
eradicated ali implants in 24% of another group of
women (roliand & van der heijden 1990; roliand
et al. 1989). the higher response rate in the latter
group may have been due to fewer patients having
severe endometriosis before treatment. there were
no significant differences between the response rate
achieved with  xxxd2691xxx  and  xxxd1806xxx .

 xxxd2691xxx : a revi ew

the proportion of women reporting severe
symptoms decreased from around 40% to about
10% within i month of treatment with  xxxd2691xxx 
800 or 400 /lg/day or with  xxxd1806xxx  800 mg/day,
and declined to i% thereafter (henzl 1989; henzl
et al. 1988). symptoms were absent in 59 of 104
(57%) recipients of  xxxd2691xxx  400 /lg/day and in 30
of 63 (48%)  xxxd1806xxx  600 mg/day recipients after 6
months' therapy (rolland & van der heijden 1990;
rolland et al. 1989). specifically, dysmenorrhoea
resolved in all except i of 50  xxxd2691xxx  recipients
after 6 months' therapy, but dyspareunia persisted
in ii of 37 and pelvic pain in 9 of 43 patients
(shaw 1990). the trend was nevertheless toward
gradual resolution of these symptoms. although
serum estradiol levels were initially stimulated by
 xxxd2691xxx , there was no disease 'flare' (henzl et al.
1988). however, 6 months after the completion of
 xxxd2691xxx  or  xxxd1806xxx  therapy, 22 to 27% of women
had a return of symptoms, mainly of moderate severity . a recurrence of dysmenorrhoea was also
documented in 2 of 7 women 3 to 6 months after
stopping  xxxd2691xxx  500/lg twice daily in a noncomparative trial (schriock et al. 1985a).
by the end of 6 months' treatment, about 75%
of  xxxd1806xxx  800 rug/day recipients compared with
over 90% of those receiving  xxxd2691xxx  800 or 400
/lg/day had clinically desirable amenorrhoea, in line
with suppression of estradiol plasma levels to 150
to 220 pmol/l and 70 to 110 pmol/l, respectively
(henzl et al. 1988; henzl & monroe 1987). amenorrhoea was achieved more rapidly with  xxxd2691xxx 
than with  xxxd1806xxx .
of 104 women attempting pregnancy after  xxxd2691xxx  treatment was discontinued, 42 succeeeded
within 12 months, 25 of whom had received 800
/lg/day (henzl et al. 1988). 16 of 45 who had previously received  xxxd1806xxx  also conceived. ovulatory menses were thus resumed, an effect noted
within 42 to 47 days of  xxxd2691xxx  discontinuation
in other women receiving the drug for endometriosis (lyles et al. 1985; schriock et al. 1985a).

3.1.2 uterine leiomyoma
leiomyoma (also known as fibroids) are benign
tumours of the uterus derived from smooth muscle.
standard treatment involves surgery, often merely

541

tumour removal, but more radical procedures such
as hysterectomy are also employed. however, since
leiomyomas are estrogen and/or progesterone dependent, gnrh agonists have been used successfully in small groups of patients (see review by filicori & flam igni 1988). twice daily intranasal
administration of  xxxd2691xxx  400/lg in ii women reduced the mean follicular phase serum estradiol
level from 158 to 73 pmol/l after 3 months, with
a further slight decline to 54 pmol/l after 6 months
(andreyko et al. 1988). the most noticeable improvements in leiomyoma size and symptoms were
evident during the period of greatest estrogen
suppression. uterine volume of the 10 women who
completed the full course of treatment decreased
by a mean of 50% within 3 months, and by another
7% after a further 3 months, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. amenorrhoea was also
induced within 3 months in all ii women, representing a considerable improvement in symptoms
since in 8 women the predominant presenting
symptom was excessive bleeding. after 6 months'
treatment, the volume of the largest leiomyoma in
each woman was reduced by a mean of 46%, but
the individual responses ranged from decreases of
7 to 98%. subsequent surgical removal of the
leiomyomas in 4 patients was uncomplicated.
thus, myomectomy following perhaps as little
as 3 months'  xxxd2691xxx  treatment may represent optimum management, since leiomyomas enlarged
again once steroid production was re-established
after  xxxd2691xxx  was stopped.

3.1.3. hirsutism and polycystic ovary
syndrome
many hirsute women have elevated serum levels of androgens as a result of adrenal and/or ovarian overproduction. androgen hypersecretion by
the ovaries is often associated with polycystic ovary
disease, a condition usually accompanied by long
term anovulation and hirsutism. however, hirsutism can also be idiopathic, and in these women
androgen production may be increased but the
ovary otherwise functions normally. in addition,
hair follicles may be hypersensitive to stimulation

542

by only slightly elevated or even normal levels of
circulating androgens.
since twice daily intranasal administration of
 xxxd2691xxx  acetate 500~g has been demonstrated to
suppress ovarian androgen synthesis almost completely (see section 1.2.2), the efficacy of 6 months
of therapy with this dosage was assessed in 6 hirsute women, including 4 with polycystic ovary disease (andreyko et al. 1986). the mean serum testosterone level fell from 2.7 to 0.97 nrnol/l within
3 months, with a corresponding decline in the biologically active unbound fraction from 37.1 to 14.2
pmol/l. there was a further slight decrease in free
testosterone to lla pmol/l at 6 months. a lower
 xxxd2691xxx  intranasal dose of 200~g twice daily also
effectively reduced total serum testosterone levels,
from a mean of 3.8 to 1.2 nrnol/l, in 15 women
with polycystic ovary syndrome after 6 months
(shaw 1989). serum androstenedione levels were
reduced by a similar extent, but the marker of
adrenal androgen synthesis, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate , was largely unaffected by either dose
of  xxxd2691xxx  (andreyko et al. 1986; williams et al.
1989).
the suppression of ovarian androgen production translated into some degree of clinical improvement in all 6 women receiving  xxxd2691xxx  500~g
twice daily. the mean hirsutism score decreased,
despite no change in the score of 2 women, i of
whom was noncompliant with the  xxxd2691xxx  nasal
spray. all women needed to shave or use a depilatory only every 4 or 5 days, compared with daily
or on alternate days before treatment. moreover,
any new hair was less coarse during  xxxd2691xxx 
therapy (andreyko et al. 1986). twice daily intranasal administration of  xxxd2691xxx  200~g, however,
produced only modest subjective improvements
and decreases in the hirsutism score of 4 women
after 6 months, and no change in 3 others after 3
or 4 months (williams et al. 1989). ultrasound revealed a decrease in ovarian volume in 4 of 8
women with polycystic ovary syndrome, and a reduction in the number of ovarian follicles in 3 of
ii women following 3 or 6 months' therapy with
this lower dosage of  xxxd2691xxx . menses occurred 2
months after stopping  xxxd2691xxx  1000 ~gjday in i

drugs 39 (4) 1990

of the 3 women with polycystic ovary disease who
presented with oligomenorrhoea, but not in the sole
amenorrhoeic woman (andreyko et al. 1986). one
previously infertile woman conceived within 6
months of discontinuing treatment with  xxxd2691xxx 
200~g twice daily (williams et al. 1989). serum androgen levels gradually increased, implying that
continuous  xxxd2691xxx  therapy would be necessary
to maintain a clinical improvement.
3.1.4 benign prostatic hypertrophy

benign hyperplasia of the prostate occurs in almost all men aged 45 years or over and it is the
most common cause of obstruction of urinary outflow (sagalowsky & wilson 1987). although both
ageing and the presence of testes are prerequisites
for hypertrophy, the exact interplay between these
factors is unclear. however, androgens are essential for continued hyperplasia.
daily subcutaneous injections of  xxxd2691xxx  acetate 400~g reduced the mean serum testosterone
level of 9 men with benign prostatic hypertrophy
from 14.1 nrnol/l to below castrate levels (about
i nrnol/l) within i month (peters & walsh 1987).
a corresponding mean decrease at 4 months in ultrasonagraphically determined prostate size of
around 25% - from a pretreatment mean weight of
48g - was maintained for the remaining 2 months
of therapy. there was an improvement of obstructive rather than irritative symptoms in 6 men, but
a clinically significant increase in peak urinary flow
rate was seen in only 3.
the initial stimulation of testosterone in the first
weeks of  xxxd2691xxx  therapy elicited a transient increase in prostatic size in 3 men, accompanied by
a transient fall in peak urinary flow rate. not surprisingly, all patients became impotent during
treatment.
testosterone production was normalised within
2 months after stopping  xxxd2691xxx , and sexual activity in 4. six months after ceasing  xxxd2691xxx , a
mean of 99% of the initial hyperplastic prostate
weight was regained, again highlighting the need
for continued therapy. however, indefinite  xxxd2691xxx  treatment should be reserved for patients in
whom prostatectomy is impossible (peters & walsh

 xxxd2691xxx : a review

1987), or perhaps as an adjuvant to induce prostatic shrinkage before surgery (decensi et al. 1988).
3.2 treatment of prostatic carcinoma
about 75% of prostatic cancers, one of the commonest causes of male cancer mortality in the
united states (see review by labrie et al. 1986),
are endocrine sensitive (see review by filicori &
flamigni 1988) and thus treatment is aimed at reducing circulating testosterone levels. conventionally, gonadal testosterone production has been diminished or abolished by orchidectomy or estrogen
therapy, usually with diethylstilbestrol ( xxxd1880xxx ), but there is now a large body of literature
demonstrating the efficacy of gnrh agonists, notably  xxxd387xxx  , leuprolide and  xxxd2229xxx , in patients
with prostate cancer (see reviews by filicori & flamigni 1988; brogden et al. 1990). present published ev idence of the efficacy of  xxxd2691xxx  in men
with stage d2 cancer of the prostate comprises only
i detailed case report, a brief summary of a small
phase ii stud y, and i larger scale trial presented
as an abstract comparing  xxxd2691xxx  and diethylstilbestrol.
in the case report, daily subcutaneous injections
of  xxxd2691xxx  400jlg in a 60-year-old man decreased
the size of a metastatic neck mass from 16 x 12cm
to 2.5 x 2.5cm, reduced serum  xxxg46xxx  levels to within the normal range and
caused substantial regression of retroperitoneal adenopathy after 5 to 6 months (gross & bremner
1987). during this period the serum testosterone
level decreased from around 10 nmol/l to between
i and 1.4 nmol/l, however, after 7 months of
treatment, the neck lymphadenopathy recurred and
acid phosphatase levels rose to twice the norrnal :
upper limit despite continued suppression of serum
testosterone to castrate levels. since  xxxd2691xxx  effectively inhibited the gonadal contribution to testosterone production, the relapse was considered to
be due to adrenal androgen secretion. once this
was also suppressed with daily dexamethasome
5mg, giving a further 10-fold reduction in serum
testosterone to almost 0.14 nrnol/l, remission was
reinduced for another 5 months. had the carci-

543

noma been entirely dependent on androgens from
the gonads,  xxxd2691xxx  may have induced a longer
remission; however, in this patient at least, the
maintenance of adrenal androgen production alone
appeared to be sufficient to re-establish active
disease .
after a transient increase during the first week
of receiving daily subcutaneous injections of  xxxd2691xxx  400jlg, the mean testosterone serum level in
9 men was less than about 1 nmol/l after 4 weeks
in a phase ii study (hoffman et al. 1987). seven
patients responded according to national prostatic
cancer project criteria, with a median time to disease progression of nearly 16 months and a median
survival time of over 2 years.
the preliminary results of an ongoing study
comparing  xxxd2691xxx  and diethylstilbestrol have
supported these findings. both drugs decreased testosterone levels and induced similar periods of remission. reductions in mean serum testosterone
levels were similar after 1 to 3 months' treatment
with either an intranasal  xxxd2218xxx  formulation
of  xxxd2691xxx  acetate 300jlg administered twice daily
to 60 men (decrease from 15.6 to 0.7 nmol/l), or
with diethylstilbestrol img 3 times daily in 65
others (decrease from 13.9 to 1 nmol/l) [eisenberger et al. 1986; hoffman et al. 1987]. consistent
with the short term effects of  xxxd2691xxx , there was
an initial increase in testosterone levels to 21.5
nmol/l after 1 week of  xxxd2691xxx  therapy, but this
was not reported to produce disease 'flare' in any
of this relatively small group of patients (eisenberger et al. 1986). after a median follow-up of 6
months, 84% of  xxxd2691xxx  and 70% of diethylstilbestrol recipients were disease free.
thus,  xxxd2691xxx  appears to be as effective as diethylstilbestrol in causing a remission in men with
prostatic carcinoma, although, as exemplified by
the case report, additional suppression of adrenal
androgens may be necessary in some patients.
3.3 use in female contraception
the effectiveness of 3 or 6 months of daily
intranasal administration of  xxxd2691xxx  acetate 125
or 250jlg as a method of contraception has been

544

drugs 39 (4) 1990

studied in small groups of regularly menstruating
women (table ii).
these studies show that no pregnancies ensued
during 59 and 222 months in 30 and 47 women,
respectively, when no contraceptive method other
than daily therapy with  xxxd2691xxx  acetate 125 or
250~g was used (gudmundsson et al. 1984, 1986).
this effect appears to have been achieved mainly
through inhibition of ovulation. depending upon
the study, ovulation was assumed to have taken
place when serum progesterone exceeded 12.7
nmol/l (monroe et al. 1986), 15.9 nmol/l (brenner et al. 1985) or 20 nmol/l (gudmundsson et al.
1986). based on these values, 81 to 100%of cycles
during treatment with  xxxd2691xxx  acetate 125 ~g/day
and 97 to 100% with 250 ~g/day were anovulatory,
with complete suppression of ovulation more frequent with the higher dosage (brenner et al. 1985;
gudmundsson et al. 1984, 1986; monroe et al.
1986). similarly, ovulation did not occur in any of
the 44 months during which 7 women with en-

dometriosis received  xxxd2691xxx  acetate 500~g twice
daily (monroe et al. 1986).
although the combined results from different
studies give a guide to the extent of ovulation inhibition achieved with  xxxd2691xxx , the issue is somewhat obscured by the different progesterone levels
taken to be indicative of ovulation. for example,
the serum levels of2 recipients ofnafarelin 125 ~g/
day participating in the study by monroe et al.
(1986) were only just above 12.7 nrnol/l and yet
ovulation was assumed to have occurred, when in
fact the slight elevation may have been due to luteinisation without subsequent ovulation. conversely, using the criteria of gudmundsson et al.
(1986), 2 women whose progesterone levels fell between 10 and 19 nmol/l were stated as being anovulatory with a luteal phase defect, whereas ovulation would perhaps have been assumed using
parameters set by other groups.

 xxxd2691xxx  : a review

been conducted. however, assuming that a serum
progesterone level of 20 nmol/l or above was indicative of ovulation, nillius (1985) reported that
625 of 628 cycles during intranasal administration
of  xxxd387xxx  200 to 600 ~g/day to 71 women and
all 89 months of treatment with  xxxd2691xxx  acetate
125 or 250 ~g/day in 30 women studied separately
were anovulatory. similarly, a level over 20 nmol/
l was detected in only i of 262 treatment months
in another group of 47 women receiving  xxxd2691xxx 
(gudmundsson et al. 1986). thus, using the same
marker of ovulation,  xxxd2691xxx  and  xxxd387xxx  appeared to be similarly successful in suppressing
ovulation when noncomparative data were assessed in parallel.
normal or near-normal bleeding patterns were
the exception during  xxxd2691xxx  treatment, occurring
in 7 of 27 and 7 of 12 women in 2 studies (gudmundsson et al. 1987a; monroe et al. 1986). bleeding was generally reduced or absent but was always
unpredictable, and amenorrhoea was experienced
by 40 to 60% of women receiving  xxxd2691xxx  acetate
125 ~g/day and by between 10 to 87% of recipients
of 250 ~g/day (brenner et al. 1985; gudmundsson
et al. 1984, 1986; monroe et al. 1986). even with
a twice daily dosage of 500~g, i woman from a
group of 7 had a single episode of bleeding after 5
months (monroe et al. 1986).
although inhibition of ovulation is the main
means by which  xxxd2691xxx  causes contraception,
endometrial changes may also playa part. after 6
months of  xxxd2691xxx  acetate treatment, secretory
endometrium was found in the biopsy specimens
from only 2 women, both of whom had received
125 ~g/day (monroe et al. 1986). light and electron microscopy of samples from 27 women revealed no ultrastructural secretory changes (gudmundsson et al. 1987a). the predominant picture
was one of atrophy, particularly in women demonstrating oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea, or of
resting or weakly proliferative tissue (gudrnundsson et al. 1987a; monroe et al. 1986). endometrial
hyperplasia was not apparent in any woman .
the contraceptive effects of  xxxd2691xxx  were entirely reversible, and ovulatory menses recommenced usually within about 30 to 45 days after

545

stopping treatment (brenner et al. 1985; gudmundsson et al. 1986; monroe et al. 1986). once
again there was considerable variability, with menstruation occurring only 13 days or as long as 137
days after ceasing  xxxd2691xxx  (brenner et al. 1985;
gudmundsson et al. 1986). the re-establishment
of fertility was abundantly evident in 5 women who
did not use any form of contraception after stopping  xxxd2691xxx  and became pregnant within i or 2
months (gudmundsson et al. 1986).
3.4 use in in vitro fertilisation programmes
the role ofgnrh analogues in conjunction with
gonadotrophin ovulation induction therapy has attracted considerable interest, but the use of  xxxd2691xxx  in this situation remains to be fully explored.
the greatest emphasis in this area has been on augmented ovulation regimens for in vitro fertilisation
programmes, where gnrh analogue-controlled
cycles are becoming almost routine (see review by
martin 1989).
there is one report of the use of  xxxd2691xxx  in in
vitro fertilisation . initially  xxxd2691xxx  400 ~g/day was
administered intranasally until ovarian follicles
greater than iomm in diameter were abolished and
serum estradiol was below about 220 pmol/l in 53
women who had failed to achieve pregnancy with
previous in vitro fertilisation programmes (martin
1989).
follicular cysts of 30 to 40mm in diameter occurred, often persisting for a few weeks after estrogen synthesis was suppressed, in 60% of patients
who started  xxxd2691xxx  therapy in the follicular phase
of the cycle, and in 16% of patients commencing
treatment in the midluteal phase. once ovarian
function was completely suppressed, follicular development was stimulated with menotropins [ xxxd2564xxx  (hmg), a combination oflh and fsh]. 33 patients subsequently
underwent embryo transfer, with a pregnancy rate
per transfer of 33% resulting in 10 successful pregnancies and deliveries.  xxxd2691xxx  will probably rank
alongside the other gnrh analogues in aiding the
development offollicles in in vitro fertilisation programmes.

546

3.5 treatment of precocious puberty
precocious puberty describes the appearance of
secondary sexual characteristics, premature bone
development and behavioural changes before the
age of 8 years in girls and 9 years in boys. sexual
precocity may be central, caused by the early onset
of pulsatile gnrh release from the pituitary, peripheral, resulting from adrenal or gonadal sex hormone synthesis, or combined, in which peripheral
hormone production activates pituitary gnrh release.
in 2 short reports, intranasal administration of
 xxxd2691xxx  400, 800 or 1600 jlg/day for i to 12
months, preceded in i study by 2 weeks' daily subcutaneous injections of 2 jlg/kg, reduced the growth
rates of 2 groups of 9 and 22 children by around
30 to 50%, in line with a fall in gnrh-induced lh
and fsh release (brzyski & comite 1988; stephure
et aj. 1985). menstruation ceased in all 6 menarchial girls (stephure et aj. 1985), and breast development was reversed in another 19, as illustrated by a 20 to 25% reduction in tanner stage
(brzyski & comite 1988). more detailed reports involving 15 girls with central precocious puberty and
7 girls and 4 boys with central or combined sexual
precocity also revealed gonadotrophin suppression, with inhibition of sex hormone production,
subsequent abolition of menses and slowing of linear growth following 6 months ' therapy with a mean
daily  xxxd2691xxx  acetate dose of 25 jlg/kg given intranasally in 3 divided doses (koehler et aj. 1988; lin
et aj. 1988). however, the effect on breast development was variable ; koehler et aj. (1988) reported a decrease in breast diameter in 6 of 7 girls,
whereas the decrease in mean tanner score from
3.4 to 3.2 in the study of lin et aj. (1988) represented a halt, but not a reversal, in growth. similarly, tanner staging of pubic hair was reduced
(koehler et aj. 1988) or unaffected (lin et aj. 1988)
by  xxxd2691xxx  therapy .  xxxd2691xxx  had no effect on
growth rate or secondary sexual characteristics of
a 5-year-old boy with familial peripheral precocious puberty (koehler et aj. 1988).
 xxxd2691xxx  therefore has some effect in children
with precocious puberty resulting from premature

drugs 39 (4) 1990

activation of the pituitary-gonadal axis, but the
variability in available study results do not permit
their quantification.

4. adverse effects
the adverse effects associated with medium or
long term  xxxd2691xxx  administration are chiefly hypoestrogenic in origin. troublesome, but not necessarily dangerous, side effects occurred about twice
as frequently with  xxxd2691xxx  than with  xxxd1806xxx , but
fewer  xxxd2691xxx  than  xxxd1806xxx  recipients experienced other potentially more serious unwanted
effects.
hot flushes were the most common complaint,
occurring in 18 to 35% of women following intranasal delivery of  xxxd2691xxx  acetate 125 jlg/day, and
in 38 to 65% at double this dosage (brenner et aj.
1985; gudmundsson et aj. 1984, 1986; monroe et
aj. 1986). the incidence increased to over 90% in
women receiving twice daily doses of  xxxd2691xxx  200,
400 or 500jlg for endometriosis (henzl et aj. 1988;
rolland & van der heijden 1990; schriock et aj.
1985a). hot flushes also occurred in all 10 men
receiving daily subcutaneous injections of  xxxd2691xxx  acetate 400jlg for prostatic hyperplasia (peters
& walsh 1987). although usually mild and tolerable, hot flushes have occasionally necessitated a
reduction in  xxxd2691xxx  dosage or withdrawal of
treatment (brenner et aj. 1985; gudmundsson et
aj. 1986; henzl et aj. 1988; schriock et aj. 1985a).
other symptoms of estrogen deficiency have
been reported, including reduced libido in 41 of
156 (26%) and vaginal dryness in 29 (19%) recipients of  xxxd2691xxx  400 to 800 jlg/day, compared with
10 (13%) and 5 (6%) of 80 women receiving  xxxd1806xxx  400mg twice daily (fig. 10) [unpublished data
on file, syntex]. however, the androgenic properties of  xxxd1806xxx  resulted in a greater frequency of
weight gain (50% vs 21% of  xxxd2691xxx  recipients),
oedema (40% vs 19%), myalgia (35% vs 22%) and
seborrhoea (28% vs 17%).  xxxd1806xxx  was also associated with clinically significant increases in aspartate and  xxxg941xxx  serum levels,
causing 2 patients to discontinue treatment (henzl
et aj. 1988). furthermore, over a period of 6 months

months (unpublished data on file, syntex).

 xxxd1806xxx  lowered high density lipoprotein (hdl)
plasma levels by between 45 and 60%, mainly
through a 60% decrease in the hdl2 fraction, and
increased low density lipoprotein (ldl) by about
20 to 40% in women with endometriosis (burry et
al. 1989; claesson & bergquist 1989; henzl et al.
1988; valimaki et al. 1989). in contrast,  xxxd2691xxx 
increased plasma hdl levels by up to 20% which,
with the lack of effect on ldl, represented a more
desirable outcome regarding atherogenic potential.
the clinical relevance of these transient changes is,
however, unclear since plasma lipids soon returned
to pretreatment levels on completion of 6 months'
therapy with  xxxd2691xxx  or  xxxd1806xxx .
the manifestation of  xxxd2691xxx 's hypoestrogenic
activity that has received most attention is its effect on bone metabolism, since prolonged depression of circulating estrogens is a well recognised
cause of accelerated bone loss and osteoporosis.

bone mineral density of the spine decreased by approximately 6 to ii % during 6 months' intranasal
treatment with  xxxd2691xxx  200 or 400~g twice daily,
but was largely unaffected by 200~g once daily, as
assessed by quantitative computed tomography
(cann et al. 1987) or dual photon absorptiometry
(johansen et al. 1988). cortical bone was affected
to a lesser extent than trabecular bone in the spine,
as illustrated by losses of between i and 2% of
proximal and distal forearm bone mineral content
(johansen et al. 1988).serum levels of calcium and
phosphate, and urinary excretion of calcium and
hydroxyproline, were elevated, indicating increased bone resorption (gudmundsson et al.
1987b; johansen et al. 1988). the rate of bone formation also increased, shown by a rise in serum
alkaline phosphatase, but it was insufficient to
compensate for resorption, the net result being bone
loss (johansen et al. 1988). however, the process
was mostly reversible, with recovery of spinal minerai density to 97% or more of pretreatment values
within 6 months of stopping  xxxd2691xxx  therapy
(cann et al. 1987; johansen et al. 1988). similarly,
markers of bone resorption were attenuated after
3 months and bone formation normalised over the
following 3 months (johansen et al. 1988). although a direct correlation could not be established, these changes in bone turnover were associated with the suppression of circulating estrogen
during therapy and its subsequent restoration on
 xxxd2691xxx  withdrawal. replacement estrogen and/
or progestogen therapy minimises bone loss during
gnrh agonist administration. unlike a group of
20 women with endometriosis receiving  xxxd2691xxx 
400 ~g/day alone for 6 months, the bone mineral
content of 17 others who received concomitant
 xxxd2751xxx  1.2 mg/day was not significantly reduced (jacobson 1990). a potential drawback to
this approach is that there could be a lack of clinical
response, caused by stimulation of hormone-dependent tissue by sex steroid therapy. this can,
however, be overcome by starting hormone replacement a few months after the gnrh agonist,
allowing sufficient time to suppress plasma estradiol levels and obtain a response (see review by
barbieri 1990b). titrating the replacement therapy

drugs 39 (4) 1990

548

may also be beneficial since there appears to be a
threshold plasma estradiol level above which a
clinical response is achieved without significant
bone loss (see review by barbieri 1990b). a cyclical
 xxxd2691xxx  regimen will also allow reversal of bone
loss if long term treatment is envisaged.
other miscellaneous adverse effects have occurred , including nasal irritation following intranasal administration (gudmundsson et al. 1984),
headache (gudmundsson et al. 1984; monroe et al.
1986) and emotional lability, perhaps as a result of
estrogen depletion (henzl et al. 1988; monroe et
al. 1986). impotence appears to be universal in men
during  xxxd2691xxx  therapy (peters & walsh 1987).
although  xxxd2691xxx  initially stimulates sex hormone release before the pituitary becomes desensitised (see section 1.2), an ensuing 'flare' of endocrine-dependent disease has only been reported
once, in 3 of 9 men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (peters & walsh 1987).

5. dosage and administration
 xxxd2691xxx , in common with other gnrh
analogues, is susceptible to peptidase degradation
in the gastrointestinal tract, precluding oral administration. subcutaneous injection or the more convenient method of intranasal delivery is therefore
necessary.
in women with endometriosis, leiomyoma or
hirsutism, intranasal treatment with  xxxd2691xxx  200
or 400~g twice daily (quantified as the free base)
has been used, starting in the first 3 or 4 days of
the menstrual cycle; 400 ~g/day was used in an in
vitro fertilisation programme.  xxxd2691xxx  acetate
therapy of men with benign hyperplasia or carcinoma of the prostate has consisted of daily subcutaneous injections of 400~g and, in the cancer
patients only, intranasal instillation of 300~g twice
daily.
as a potential method of female contraception,
 xxxd2691xxx  acetate 125~g or, more effectively, 250~g
has been given as a once-daily intranasal dose, beginning between day i and 6 of the cycle. in some
men, aspermatogenesis has only been achieved with
a constant subcutaneous infusion of  xxxd2691xxx  400

supplemented by intramuscular  xxxd3326xxx  200mg on alternate weeks. however, azoospermia was not universal even with this
regimen.
children with central precocious puberty have
received  xxxd2691xxx  400 to 1600~g intranasally, once
daily or in 3 divided doses. in some children subcutaneous treatment with 2 ~g/kg for 2 weeks has
preceded intranasal administration.
all of the above possible indications for  xxxd2691xxx  require continual suppression of the pituitarygonadal axis, necessitating prolonged therapy.
however, cyclical treatment of 6 months or less
may be necessary, particularly in patients receiving
relatively high  xxxd2691xxx  doses, to allow recovery of
transient bone loss, a consequence of estrogen
suppression . hormone replacement therapy also
appears to allay bone turnover. additionally, although endometrial hyperplasia resulting from unopposed estrogenic effects has not been demonstrated, some women receiving low doses of
 xxxd2691xxx  which do not completely inhibit estradiol
synthesis may benefit from concomitant cyclical
progestogen therapy. such a regimen would also
establish regular menstruation.

~g/day,

6. place of  xxxd2691xxx  in therapy
the synthetic gnrh agonists, of which  xxxd2691xxx  is one of the most potent (nestor et al. 1982),
are becoming widely accepted in the management
of a variety of benign and malignant conditions
dependent on the reproductive-endocrine axis.
despite limited clinical experience with  xxxd2691xxx , emerging trends for its use can be identified.
currently,  xxxd2691xxx  has had widest application in
women. the most likely niche for  xxxd2691xxx  is in
the setting of endometriosis, where intranasal
treatment with the drug appears to be as effective
as  xxxd1806xxx  given orally, the current mainstay of
management, in improving symptoms and reducing ectopic tissue, but with fewer potentially serious adverse effects. in women with uterine leiomyoma,  xxxd2691xxx  causes a regression in lesion size
and thus may facilitate surgical excision of fibroids. hirsute women, including those with poly-

 xxxd2691xxx : a revi ew

cystic ovary syndrome, may also benefit from  xxxd2691xxx  therapy, since the drug slows hair growth
and thins any new hair in these patients . in infertile women choosing in vitro fertilisation,  xxxd2691xxx 
may join the other gnrh agonists now almost
universally used to augment follicular development.
the effect of  xxxd2691xxx  in men with disorders
involving the pituitary-gonadal axis has been less
well studied. nonetheless, preliminary results suggest that intranasal administration of  xxxd2691xxx  is
at least comparable to oral treatment with diethylstilbestrol in producing medium to long term disease-free remission of cancer of the prostate. concomitant dexamethasone may be useful in some
patients to also suppress adrenal androgen production. obstructive and, to a lesser extent, irritative symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy
appear to be effectively relieved by daily subcutaneoustreatment with  xxxd2691xxx . although the
intranasal route has not been studied in this clinical
setting, it is likely to be more attractive than subcutaneous injections to men with hyperplastic
prostates. it has been suggested that a  xxxd2691xxx  regimen be reserved for those men in whom prostatectomy is impracticable since continual treatment
would be necessary to maintain remission. however, adjuvant administration of  xxxd2691xxx  could aid
surgery, as in women with leiomyomas, by causing
preoperative tissue shrinkage.
in children, most of the signs and symptoms of
central precocious pubert y are attenuated during
intranasal maintenance with  xxxd2691xxx , implying a
possible role in these patients which warrants further investigation .
 xxxd2691xxx  has some potential as a female contraceptive, as ovulation is often inhibited and pregnancy prevented by intranasal administration of
the drug, but considerable variability in individual
response may limit its usefulness. this is even more
apparent in men, where the frequency of aspermatogenesis is highly unpredictable, even with
concomitant testosterone administration, indicating that  xxxd2691xxx  is unlikely to find a use as a male
contraceptive.
in summary,  xxxd2691xxx  has significant potential

549

for use in women with endometriosis. it has also
yielded promising results in men, women and
children in several other conditions dependent on
the reproductive-endocrine axis, including uterine
leiomyoma, hirsutism, benign hypertrophy and
carcinoma of the prostate, and central precocious
puberty . although  xxxd2691xxx  cannot be recommended on present evidence as a male contraceptive, altering the timing of concomitant androgen
administration may overcome incomplete azoospermia . the possible role of nafarelinin female
contraception appears to be limited by the unreliability of ovulation suppression. thus, although
in some clinical settings the promising early findings with  xxxd2691xxx  need confirmation through further comparative studies with established therapy
and with other gnrh agonists,  xxxd2691xxx  offers a
useful alternative to the limited range of options
available for treating the diversity of conditions
discussed in this review.
