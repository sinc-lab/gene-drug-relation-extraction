abstract the cardiovascular drug lacidipine (lc) is
known to possess antibacterial activity. further potentiation of action is possible by synergism between lc and
an antibiotic or a non-antibiotic. the minimum inhibitory
concentration (mic) of antibiotics, lc and other nonantibiotics were detected by the agar dilution technique
in different bacteria. synergism was determined by disc
diffusion assay, the fractional inhibitory concentration
(fic) index through checkerboard assessment and, also,
the protective capacity of the combination by administering the drugs along with 50 × ld50 challenge dose of
virulent salmonella typhimurium in animal experiments.
synergism between lc and penicillin was found to be
statistically significant (p≤0.01) when compared with
their individual effects. the fic index of this combination
was 0.375, confirming synergism. in vivo tests suggested
the statistically significant protection of infected mice with
this combination. lc exhibited synergism when combined

both in vitro and in vivo. distinct antimicrobial action of
lc and its subsequent synergism with other drugs can
open up the possibility of synthesising new molecules by
the structural analyses of these compounds.

introduction
it is now known that the antibiotics and antibacterial
chemotherapeutics that had been active against a very
wide range of bacterial pathogens have gradually lost the
battle, as mutants resistant to such agents have quickly
developed throughout the world. significant antimicrobial action has been detected in a large variety of
pharmacologically distinct classes of compounds, which
are grouped together as ‘non-antibiotics’ [1–5]. this has
now opened up a new avenue for fighting the ever-increasing
problem of drug-resistance. these non-antibiotics possess
most of the characteristics of antibiotics and their
antimicrobial function can often be further potentiated
by suitable combinations resulting in synergism [1, 6–9].
the present study describes the augmentation of the
antimicrobial function of the recently described nonantibiotic, the cardiovascular drug lacidipine (lc) [10],
by combining it with standard antibiotics and highly
powerful non-antibiotics.

drugs penicillin (pc), ampicillin (am), streptomycin (sm),
gentamicin (gm), erythromycin (er), tetracycline (tc),
chloramphenicol (cm), ciprofloxacin (cf), lacidipine (lc),
 xxxd2593xxx  (md), diclofenac (dc) and  xxxd3433xxx 
(tf) were obtained as pure dry powders from manufacturers
in india and preserved at 4°c.
media liquid media were nutrient broth (nb; oxoid),
peptone water (pw) containing 1.0% peptone (oxoid)
and 0.5% nacl and mueller hinton broth ( xxxd2715xxx ;
oxoid). solid media were nutrient agar (na, oxoid),
mueller hinton agar (mha, oxoid) and peptone agar
(pa) prepared by solidifying pw with 1.0% agar (oxoid
no. 3), ph 7.2–7.4.
inoculum bacteria were grown overnight in pa/na/mha
at 37°c, harvested during stationary phase, suspended in
5 ml of sterile distilled water and the turbidity of each was
adjusted to match against a 0.5 mcfarland standard [1] with
a spectrophotometer at 625 nm corresponding to 2.4×108
colony-forming units (cfu)/ml.
determination of the mic of antibiotics and nonantibiotics this was carried out according to the clinical
and laboratory standards institute (clsi) [11] guidelines
by spotting 105 cfu with a 2-mm loop full of 1/10 dilution
of 18-h broth cultures on plates containing 0 (control), 2, 5,
10, 25, 50, 100, 200 and 400 µg/ml of a drug, observed
after 24 h, and up to 72 h.
tests for in vitro synergism the combined effects of lc
and another drug were determined by the disc diffusion
technique with sterile filter paper discs (7.25 mm,
whatman no. 1) containing 5 µg of an antibiotic and

200 µg of lc [7–9]. sensitive bacteria were grown in
liquid media for 18 h flooded on solid media in triplicate;
the plates were dried at 37°c. drug-impregnated discs were
placed on agar and incubated at 37°c, and the zones of
inhibition were measured. depending on the result, discs
containing lc and another agent were placed on prepared
plates in such a way that their inhibitory circles would touch
each other tangentially. the diameters of inhibition zones due
to individual and mutual effects on the same plate were
recorded. the increase in surface area (pir2) due to a
combination of effects was statistically evaluated by the chi2
test for its significance [8, 9].
checkerboard procedure this was performed in microtitre trays with  xxxd2715xxx  [12]. pc was tested at 0.312 to
10.0 µg/ml and lc was used at concentrations of 1.56 to
50 µg/ml. the checkerboard was arranged as follows. in
the first row, all of the wells contained 50 µg of lc and
either 0, 0.312, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0 or 10 µg of pc in a
final volume of 1 ml of  xxxd2715xxx . in the second row, the
wells contained 25 µg of lc and increasing amounts of pc,
as above. similar patterns were followed for all of the
rows. in the last row, the wells had varying amount of pc
only. for synergism between lc and tf, the concentrations
of both drugs were 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640 and
1,280 µg. an inoculum of 0.5 mcfarland’s standard was
applied using a multipoint inoculator, incubated aerobically at 37°c for 24 h. the presence or absence of growth
was noted visually. the fractional inhibitory concentration
(fic) index [12] was calculated as follows: mic of pc
tested in combination/mic of pc tested alone + mic of lc
tested in combination/mic of lc tested alone. the
interaction was interpreted as synergistic when the fic
index was <1.

in vivo experiments
swiss albino male mice maintained in our animal house and
salmonella typhimurium nctc 74 being sensitive to lc
and many other drugs were used. the median lethal dose
(mld or ld50) of the mouse-passaged strain was as
described earlier [10]. drugs were given intraperitoneally,
with the doses being calculated from the available pharmacological data [10, 13]. to determine the synergistic effects
of lc+pc, 20 mice were divided into four batches with five
mice in each. the first batch received lc (µg/mouse), the
second batch had 60 µg of pc, while the third batch was
given lc (30 µg) plus pc (60 µg) and the remaining batch
received only saline. after 3 h, all of the animals were
challenged with 1.85×109 cfu of s. typhimurium nctc 74
[10]. the animals were autopsied 18 h after the challenge.
their liver(s) and spleen(s) were collected individually and
homogenised for the determination of cfu count; from the
same animals, 0.2 to 0.4 ml of heart blood were collected
aseptically, allowed to clot and analysed for the size of
bacteraemia and the amount of drug in the sera. drug
concentrations in mice were determined at 0 h with the help
of inhibition zones produced by serum-soaked filter paper
discs (7.2 mm, 3-mm thick, millipore, absorbing about
0.03 ml volume) on a culture lawn grown on pa seeded
with 105 cfu of s. typhimurium nctc 74 [7–9]. drug
concentrations were deduced by reference to a standard
curve calibrated with known concentrations of each drug
[8, 9].

results
mic of antibiotics and non-antibiotics table 1 describes
the inhibitory spectra of ten bacteria with respect to nine
antibiotics and four non-antibiotics. comparatively, the
three gram-positive strains were more sensitive to the
agents than the gram-negative strains. the mic of pc, am,
sm, gm, tc, cm and cf with respect to all of the test
bacteria ranged from 2 to 25 µg/ml, while the mic of er
was between 2 and 100 µg/ml. the mic of the nonantibiotics md, tf, dc and lc mostly ranged between 25
and 200 µg/ml; however, both of the s. aureus strains were
more sensitive to md, tf and dc than the other bacteria.
effects of combinations of antibiotics, non-antibiotics and lc
in vitro in the disc diffusion assay tests between lc and
antibiotics, varying degrees of synergism was revealed
between the lc + pc, lc + am, lc + sm, lc + gm, lc +
er, lc + cf, lc + md and lc + tf combinations.
indifference was observed with lc + cm and lc + dc
combinations, while distinct antagonism was detected when
combination tests were performed with lc and tc.

an elaborate study on the synergism between lc
and pc with respect to ten bacteria is presented in
tables 2 and 3. when the drug discs were placed
individually on the culture lawn of s. aureus nctc
6571, the diameter of the zone of inhibition due to pc was
28.6 mm and the same due to lc was 21.2 mm. these
increased to 31.4 mm and 23.5 mm, respectively, when the
discs were placed for determining the effect of combination between pc and lc. the increase in surface area due
to combination was 20.53% for pc and 20.28% for lc.
similarly, s. typhimurium nctc 74 singly produced an
inhibition zone of 20.0 mm due to pc and 14.2 mm against
lc discs, which enlarged to 21.8 mm and 15.5 mm,
respectively, in the combined test. further studies with
combinations in all of the other test bacteria confirmed
synergism between pc and lc (tables 2 and 3). this
synergistic effect obtained between pc and lc in terms of
percentage increase in the size of their inhibition zones
was assessed for their level of significance for both drugs.
the activity of pc was between 5.90 and 115.11% higher
compared to their individual effects; similarly, that of lc
varied from 8.55 to 44.38% in the tests for combination
assay vis-à-vis their individual inhibitory effect. the
percentage increase in surface area was found to be
statistically significant with respect to all of the ten test
organisms.
checkerboard experiment for the determination of the fic
index the mic of lc with respect to s. aureus nctc
6571 in  xxxd2715xxx  was 25.0 µg/ml, while that of pc was
2.5 µg/ml. in combination, the mic values became 12.5
and 1.25 µg/ml for lc and pc, respectively. the data
presented above for the determination of the synergistic
antibacterial effect indicated that the combination produced a significant synergism of the pair lc + pc, as
the fic index was calculated to be 0.375. in the case of
the lc + tf combination, it was found that the mic
of lc with respect to s. typhimurium nctc 74 was
320 µg/ml, while that of tf was 160 µg/ml. in
combination, both of the values became 20 µg/ml and
the fic index was calculated to be 0.18. thus, synergism
was evident in the data presented here for the combination
of lc and tf.
synergism in vivo the 50 × ld50 dose of the virulent s.
typhimurium nctc 74 [10] was 1.85×109. the animal
experiments with blood and organ homogenates from
normal mice belonging to the same stock yielded no
salmonellae. the combination of lc and pc significantly
reduced the cfu/ml count of s. typhimurium in the organ
homogenates of mice, as determined 18 h after the
challenge; a similar significant reduction was also observed
in the in vivo tests with the lc and tf combination.

pc = penicillin (5 µg/disc); lc = lacidipine (200 µg/disc).
the mean surface area of the inhibition zone (mm2 ) was calculated as pir2 on the basis of the mean diameter (2r), and percentage increase was
calculated as (b − a)/ax100, where a = surface area due to the individual effect and b = surface area due to the combined effect. the zones of
inhibition formed in combination with respect to pc and lc were larger in size than those formed singly against the same compounds. these were
calculated statistically by determining student’s t-test based on the values of standard deviation and standard error obtained, which showed the
differences to be highly significant (p<0.01) with respect to all of the test bacteria

discussion
antimicrobial action of the cardiovascular drug lc has
already been previously reported [10] and now we are able
to demonstrate clearly the enhancement and promotion of
its activity when combined with a suitable antibiotic like pc
or a non-antibiotic like tf. quantitative estimation using the
percentage increase in the surface area of inhibition zones
produced in combined tests compared with those produced
by the individual zones clearly indicated a significant
augmentation of action. this in vitro estimation was found
to be statistically significant. checkerboard titration further
provided synergistic action between lc + pc and lc + tf
combinations. animal experiments additionally proved
synergism between these drugs. it may be pointed out that
the amount of lc necessary to inhibit bacteria in vitro is
considerably larger than that required by pc, but in in vivo
tests, it is evident that the protective dose of lc is distinctly
smaller compared to pc. since both of these drugs have
been used in humans satisfactorily for many years in
clinical medicine for different purposes, their rather low

toxicity and large safety margins observed during human
application appear to be encouraging [13].
extensive studies on non-antibiotics [1–5] have revealed
that various phenothiazines possessing tricyclic benzene
rings are often highly powerful antimicrobics. however,
pharmacologically distinct chemical compounds having
two benzene rings can also be potential antimicrobics [5,
8, 9]. definite antimicrobial action in lc and its subsequent
synergism with antibiotics indicate that, like sulphonamides, nalidixic acid, nitrofurans and other antibacterial
chemotherapeutics, this non-antibiotic may exhibit a broad
spectrum of activity independently and also in suitable
combinations. it is noted that synergy between lc and pc
against a test organism is a unique phenomenon. although
the exact mechanism of action of most non-antibiotic drugs
have not yet been fully analysed, there is a possibility of
multiple factors interfering with cellular biosynthesis [13].
the same factors could reduce the mic of two drugs in a
combination to even below their break-point concentrations, thereby, making the pair synergistic. in the combination test for synergism by the fic index, it was evident that

the actual amount of each drug in the test pair was much
lower than that required for the individual tests, implying
that a suitable synergistic combination like that of lc and
pc or lc and tf would allow a reduction in the doses of
both drugs, thus, overcoming the problem of unrealistic
break-point concentrations of these drugs for prolonged
use. however, since the concentration of most nonantibiotics cannot be reduced to as low as existing
antibiotics, a shorter duration of therapy may be achieved
by administering their combinations, e.g. lc + md or lc +
tf, thereby, reducing the hazards of toxic effects. the
synergistic combinations as presented in this study, along
with our earlier related work [1, 7–9], would, hopefully,
open up a prospective path in the selection of antimicrobial
therapeutic regimens to contribute to the continuing fight
against multi-drug-resistant microorganisms.
