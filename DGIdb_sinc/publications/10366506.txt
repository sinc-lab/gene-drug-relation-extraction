campath-1 antibodies have a long and successful history in the treatment of leukaemia, autoimmune disease and transplant rejection. the
Â®rst antibody to undergo ``humanisation'',  xxxd107xxx , permits treatment with limited patient anti-globulin response. it recognises the  xxxg393xxx 
antigen which is a small glycosylphosphatidylinositol(gpi)-anchored
protein expressed on lymphocytes and mediates cell depletion. we

an analogue of the antigenic determinant of  xxxg393xxx . analysis of the
 xxxd107xxx  binding site reveals that in contrast to most antibodies
cdr l3 plays a dominant role in antigen binding. furthermore cdr h3,
which is essential for effective antigen recognition in most antibodies,
participates in only two main-chain interactions in  xxxd107xxx . the
 xxxd107xxx  binding site is highly basic; ionic interaction with the
enthanolamine phosphate of the  xxxg393xxx  gpi anchor has long been hypothesised to be important in antigen binding. the structure reveals a number
of important speciÂ®c ionic interactions, including lys53h but not
lys52bh as had previously been suggested. prolonged treatment with
 xxxd107xxx  can lead to patient anti-idiotype responses which may be
exacerbated by the unusually high number of basic residues in the antibody. this suggests that a strategy where redundant basic residues are
replaced with neutral counterparts may be effective in further reducing
the immunogenicity of this versatile and widely used antibody.

the Â®rst campath-1 antibodies were raised
over 15 years ago against t-cell enriched human
mononuclear cells as part of a strategy to prevent
graft versus host disease (hale et al., 1983). it was
hoped that by using an antibody which activated
complement, donor marrow could be completely
depleted of t-cells prior to transplantation. the
original campath-1m (rat igm) proved highly
efÂ®cient at killing both t-cells and b-cells and has
been widely used ex vivo for prevention of graftversus-host disease (hale & waldmann, 1994).
however, complement activation alone was insufÂ®cient for elimination of cells in vivo. the rat igg2b
antibody campath-1g was also able to bind
human fc receptors (fcr) and mediate antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity (adcc) and is a
potent lympholytic agent in vivo, being used in

treatment of leukaemia and transplant rejection
(friend et al., 1991; hale et al., 1998). however,
treatment with campath-1g is limited by the
patient anti-rat response (cobbold et al., 1990; dyer
et al., 1989; rebello et al., 1999). in order to reduce
immunogenicity, the kabat hypervariable regions
were cloned into a framework provided by human
new and rei myeloma proteins (riechmann et al.,
1988). the human igg1 heavy chain was chosen
because it gave the best combination of fcr binding, adcc and complement activation, analogous
to rat igg2b.  xxxd107xxx  has been used in the
treatment of autoimmune diseases such as multiple
sclerosis (moreau et al., 1994, 1996), systemic vasculitis (lockwood et al., 1996; mathieson et al.,
1990) and rheumatoid arthritis (isaacs et al., 1992),
as well as lymphocytic leukaemia, non-hodgkin's
lymphoma (hale et al., 1988; osterborg et al., 1997;
pawson et al., 1997), and for prevention of transplant rejection (calne et al., 1998).
despite its powerful immunosuppressive effects,
some patients are still able to mount anti-idiotype
responses against the cdrs, after repeat treatments
(isaacs, 1990). antibodies which bind to cells and
engage fc receptors appear to be particularly
powerful immunogens (routledge et al., 1995).
however, studies by gilliland & walsh in transgenic mice have shown that non-binding mutants
of  xxxd107xxx  can induce tolerance to wildtype binding antibodies (gilliland et al., 1999).
while this approach proved very effective, incomplete tolerance was observed in some mice, which
made a speciÂ®c response against the unique wildtype epitope. further improvements are required
to optimise the tolerisation process and cover all
the wild-type epitopes.
recently we described the crystal structures of
campath-1g and  xxxd107xxx  reÂ®ned at 2.6
Ãª , respectively (cheetham et al., 1998). if
and 3.25 a
the antibody-antigen complex could be crystallised
and the structure solved at high resolution, the
information would guide further reÂ®nements of
the  xxxd107xxx  antibody in three important
ways; (a) by rational design of a higher-afÂ®nity
antibody, (b) by removal of potentially immunogenic residues which do not contribute to antigenbinding, (c) by facilitating the design of non-binding mutants for use as tolerogens. furthermore,
this would extend our understanding of antibodyantigen complexes to a new class of molecules, i.e.
those involving gpi anchors.
 xxxg393xxx  is the shortest  xxxg397xxx 
yet characterised, containing a peptide of only
12 amino acid residues (figure 1). treatment of
puriÂ®ed  xxxg393xxx  with the protease pronase generates a c-terminal tripeptide, (sps), still linked to
the anchor and this fragment retains antigenicity.
however, it is heterogeneous due to variability
in the lipid component (treumann et al., 1995)
and it was deemed impracticable to attempt cocrystallisation experiments with it. therefore a
panel of synthetic epitopes based around the
peptide tssps was generated, with additional

residues coupled to the c terminus to mimic the
gpi anchor (hale, 1995).  xxxd107xxx  displayed greatest afÂ®nity for mimotopes which
contained gly or ala followed by a negatively
charged residue such as asp or glu. in the
native antigen the sps tripeptide is followed by
an ethanolamine phosphate moiety; conceivably
the synthetic peptide tsspsad (figures 1 and 2)
is a good structural mimic because the
additional residues ad provide a negative
charge placed similarly to the phosphate of the
native antigen. in addition to implicating important binding interactions, this study provided an
ideal candidate, the peptide tsspsad, for analysing the complexed antibody.

results and discussion
comparison of native and
complexed structures
kabat sequence numbers are used here throughÃª
out. the native structure was determined at 3.2 a
(cheetham et al., 1998) and therefore has a greater
positional error than the complexed structure
described here. to verify the observed differences
in side-chain conformations, the native cdrs were
re-solved using omit maps. a least-squares superimposition gives an r.m.s. difference between the
Ãª for all c-alpha atoms and
structures of 0.84 a
Ãª for cdr c-alpha atoms indicating that, glob0.82 a
ally, they are similar. there is also little difference in
the elbow angles; in the ligand structure it is 125.7 
whereas in the native it is 128  , a change of only
2 %. there is a signiÂ®cant change in the vhvl interface however; the interface area in the native strucÃª 2 in the
Ãª 2, compared to 1659 a
ture is 1587 a
complexed structure, an increase of approximately
5 %. these changes are accompanied by an overall
Ãª.
vhvl rotation of 1.91  and a translation of 1.89 a
there are signiÂ®cant differences in the position
of speciÂ®c residue side-chains within the antigencombining site (acs; see figure 3). in the complexed structure arg94l adopts an alternative
conformation to that seen in the native structure
in order to prevent a steric clash with the sidechain of serp5 and to allow it to form a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of serp5. in
the native structure arg94l forms a hydrogen
bond with glu61h, and so it could not adopt

the outside of the antibody.  xxxg393xxx  mimotope is marked

this alternative conformation without a corresponding change in the conformation of the glutamate. indeed this is exactly what is seen in the
complexed structure where glu61h is found in a
new conformation stabilised via a hydrogen
bond with the guanidinium group of arg52h,
allowing arg94l to move. interestingly, this new
glu61h conformation and hydrogen bond interaction with arg52h is found in the structure
of the uncomplexed parental rat antibody
campath-1g (cheetham et al., 1998). it therefore seems reasonable to suggest that whilst the
movement of arg94l is likely to be a ligandinduced change, certain differences between the
complexed and uncomplexed structures may represent pre-existing isomers, with the peptide preferentially binding to one particular isomer.
many of the aromatic residues within the cdrs
are found in different conformations in the two
structures. aromatic residues help maintain packing in the cdrs and the rotation of planar sidechains in the complexed structure has undoubtedly induced subtle changes in the stacking conditions. the presence of the ligand also creates
now potential stacking partners and thus contributes to the differences observed between the two
structures. for instance, the tyrosine residue at
position l32 has rotated 45  with respect to the
native structure, allowing the delocalised electron
ring to stack edge to plane with the proline residue at p5. there are further differences in the
position of important interacting residues
between the complexed and uncomplexed structures, in particular lys53h. an alternative sidechain conformation moves the e-amino group of
Ãª from its position in the native
lys53h by 4.8 a
structure and into hydrogen bond distance with
asp7p.
the high resolution of the complexed structure
has enabled the loop between h134 and h143 to
be modelled; in the native structure there was
insufÂ®cient density for it to be determined. in
Ãª structure which were
addition, regions of the 3.2 a
inadequately modelled due to poor local density
have been improved. in the uncomplexed structure
thr98h had been built in an unfavourable conformation: the correct backbone conformation brings
the his97h peptide oxygen into hydrogen bond
distance with the peptide, revealing an important
speciÂ®c interaction.
the native structures of both the humanised and
parental rat antibodies ( xxxd107xxx  and campath-1g), were solved from crystals grown in
20 % peg. native  xxxd107xxx  crystals also
grew in the alkali citrate conditions used here for
the ligand structure but never reached an appreciable size. dissection of whether the observed
differences between the complexed and uncomplexed structures represent the crystallisation of
different naturally occurring antibody isomers or
are a result of an ``induced Â®t'' conformational
change is complicated by the differences in crystallisation conditions. determination of the native

296
structure of  xxxd107xxx  from crystals grown in
the citrate conditions used in the complexed
structure presented here might resolve the contribution made by the crystallisation conditions.
topology of antigen recognition
the peptide sits in a shallow u-shaped cleft,
lying roughly parallel with the plane made by the
tips of the cdrs (see figures 4 and 5). the sides of
the cleft are delimited by residues try32l tyr33h,
lys53h arg42h, arg94l and his97h. the cleft is
not entirely enclosed however and a groove
extends out between thr98h and lys31l, ending
in solvent. most of the cleft is occupied by the
bound peptide, except at the n terminus where
there is a cavity bounded by  xxxd233xxx  residues
h31 and h52a. in the ligand structure this is Â®lled
with a cluster of water molecules: w3, w35, w135,
w155. the base of the cleft is formed by a salt
bridge between residues arg96l and glu95h
which lie directly underneath the peptide; this salt
bridge can be seen as charged patches (see
figure 4). the peptide penetrates down into the
acs only at serine residues p3 and p5. at p3 the
c-beta points down toward pro100ah and his91l,
which together form the base of the cleft at this
point. at p5 the backbone points down between
arg96l and arg94l, allowing the o-gamma of
serp5 to interact with residues at the base. the
Â®nal residues of the peptide rise up out of the cleft
to leave the  xxxd233xxx  residue at p7 adjacent to
a bank of positive charge provided by residues
arg52h, lys53h and arg94l.

from the cdrs are involved in the contact surface
and there is no contribution from framework residues. the interaction surface is comprised almost
equally from both chains, with the light chain providing slightly less, 49 %, of the contact area. light
chains in antibody-peptide complexes usually only
account for between 10 and 40 % of antigen binding. the Â®gure in this case is high even for an antibody-protein complex where 49 % is amongst the
highest reported. this suggests that the light chain
plays an unusually signiÂ®cant role in antigen recognition. examining peptide contact by cdr
reveals that most light chain interaction comes
from l3, which accounts for 74 % of total light
chain contact and 36 % of the interface area overall.
specific antibody-antigen interactions

highlighted when speciÂ®c interactions are con-

sidered. of the 54 contacts, 11 fulÂ®l the criteria for
putative hydrogen bonds (see figure 5), which is
about average for an antibody-protein complex
(davies & cohen, 1996), and Â®ve of these bonds
involve residues his91l, arg94l and arg96l
within cdr l3. these residues form a network of
hydrogen bonds with the central ser-pro-ser residues of the mimotope. mutational analysis of the
mimotope (hale, 1995), showed that these residues
must be absolutely conserved in order to maintain
binding. cdr l3 is therefore critical to successful
antigen recognition, a prominence not often seen in
other complexed antibody structures. whilst this is
true, however, interactions involving residues
his91l, arg94l and arg96l are not uncommon; a
recent review (maccallum et al., 1996) found that
each of the three residues made contacts in 21 out
of the 26 antibody-ligand structures then in the
pdb database. other residues commonly involved
in antigen binding include tyrosine at position
h33. residue tyr33h makes an important charged
hydrogen bond in this antibody with the aspartic
acid residue at position p7. tyrosine residues have
been observed as being three times more likely to
appear in the cdrs than in the framework
(padlan, 1994). in the  xxxd107xxx  antibody
there are four other tyrosine residues (tyr32l,
tyr55h, tyr59h and tyr102h); however, only
tyr32l appears to be important in antigen binding
through a general stacking interaction with pro5p.
the other light chain cdrs l1 and l2 do not
form any speciÂ®c contacts with the antigen and
therefore appear to have no role in recognition.
these Â®ndings are in excellent agreement with the
cdr-swap experiments carried out by gilliland &
walsh (gilliland et al., 1999). in their study each rat
cdr was systematically replaced with a cdr from
the myeloma antibody originally used to provide
the humanised framework (gilliland et al., 1999).
only those chimeras with non-campath-1
hypervariable loops l1 or l2 were still able to bind
antigen.
of the heavy chain cdrs, h3 is almost always
the most prominent in antigen binding. in  xxxd107xxx  the cdr h3 forms only two main-chain
hydrogen bonds, via peptide oxygen atoms at h96
and h97. these interactions are with n-terminal
residues of the peptide, which are known to lie
outside the essential epitope region on the native
antigen. cdr h3 is therefore possibly the least
important of the four interacting cdrs and, with
only main-chain interactions implicated, probably
the most able to accommodate site-directed mutagenesis. however, it is also in h3 that any difference between mimotope and native antigen
binding is likely to be found, as the cavities that
have been identiÂ®ed as potential sites for binding
additional residues are located in proximity to h3
(see figures 4 and 5).
the most striking feature of the binding site is
the strong positive charge (see figures 4 and 6).
the acs contains eight lysine and arginine residues, compared with an average of 4.9 in anti-

bodies (kabat et al., 1991), without a compensating
increase in the number of aspartic or  xxxd2431xxx 
residues. this correlates well with the observation
that adding a negatively charged residue to the c
terminus of the mimotope enhances binding, presumably by mimicking the epitope ethanolamine
phosphate (hale, 1995). whilst these Â®ndings had
already argued the importance of charge complementarity in antigen recognition, the absence of
any structural information had precluded the
implication of speciÂ®c residues. this high-resolution structure allows speciÂ®c residues to be pinpointed.
in the complexed structure seen here, the  xxxd233xxx  residue at p7 is in close proximity to a belt
of positive charge from arg94l and the cdr h2
residues arg52h and lys53h, allowing the formation of four charged hydrogen bonds. charged
hydrogen bonds are stronger than their uncharged
counterparts (4.5 kcal/mol versus 2-3 kcal/mol;
fersht et al., 1985), making these residues, along
with tyr33h, particularly critical in antigen binding. comparison to other phosphate binding anti-

298
bodies (e.g. mcpc603), reveals that the same residues are often involved in phosphate contact, for
example mcpc603 also uses tyr33h and arg52h
(satow, et al., 1986). based on predictions from the
native structure of the importance of cdr h2 in
antigen recognition, gilliland & walsh constructed
a series of site-directed mutants of the h2 loop to
try and abolish binding. of these mutants,
asp52ah, lys52bh, and lys53h, only the mutant
lys53hasp was unable to bind antigen (as estimated by elisa, gilliland et al., 1999). in the
ligand structure it can be seen that only lys53h
contacts the peptide, whilst lys52bh is orientated
away into solvent. indeed, the mimotope structure
allows other predictions to be made; for instance
replacing arg52h with a negatively charged residue should also abolish binding.
the importance of water molecules in antigen
recognition is a subject of recent debate in the
current literature (bhat et al., 1994). the high resolution of this ligand-bound structure has allowed
the deÂ®nitive placement of a large number of
water molecules. of the 15 molecules found in the
acs, 11 contact the peptide directly, but none
of these 11 seem to be involved in any bridging
interaction.
potential differences between native antigen
and mimotope binding
the peptide mimic has an estimated afÂ®nity constant of 4.4  106 mÃ¿1, which is rather less than the
estimated 1.2  108 mÃ¿1 for campath-1g versus
native antigen (bindon et al., 1988). although these
Â®gures are by no means deÂ®nitive (authors report
difÂ®culties in reproducible coupling), they do
suggest a 50-fold difference in afÂ®nity. this is not
altogether unsurprising if it is considered that the
antigenic determinant from which the mimotope
was derived has a lower afÂ®nity than the full antigen sequence. a 50-fold difference in afÂ®nity could
theoretically be recovered by a single hydrogen
bond. it is possible that additional contacts made
in vivo, whilst unimportant in recognition, serve to
anchor the antigen once bound, reducing the koff
(the dissociation rate constant for the mimotope is
unusually low at 9.4  10Ã¿3 mÃ¿1), and recovering
afÂ®nity. alternatively, there is a cavity within the
binding site into which additional residues might Â®t
(see figure 4). this cavity, which in the model contains four clustered water molecules, could easily
accommodate the next n-terminal residue of the
native antigen, glutamine. however, no deÂ®nitive
explanations can be made until the complex of the
antibody with intact native antigen is solved and
analysed together with more accurate kinetic data.
future engineering
one of the major problems with the use of antibodies in therapy is the immune response mounted
against them. a strategy of humanisation is often
adopted to reduce the immunogenicity, but

structure of  xxxd107xxx  with bound mimotope

patients can still react against the cdrs. with the
complexed structure now available it should be
possible to further humanise non-essential cdr
residues and further reduce inherent immunogenicity. by changing the sequence, the pattern of epitopes presented on the mhc could be altered
resulting in t-cell anergy rather than activation if
presented epitopes have a weak afÂ®nity for the
tcr or are recognised as ``self''. it is thought that
charged residues in mhc-presented epitopes are of
particular importance in ensuring successful tcr
recognition (dessen et al., 1997).  xxxd107xxx 
is an unusually basic antibody such that a strategy involving the removal of all non-binding
charged surface residues might immediately
reduce immunogenicity. there is a potential problem to this approach however. the antigenic
determinant of  xxxg393xxx  lies very close to the cell
membrane and it is possible that the strong positive charge associated with the cdrs is important
in stabilising binding through charge complementarity with membrane phospholipids. perhaps loss
of this general stabilisation contributes to the
reduced afÂ®nity displayed by both the pronasetreated native epitope and its peptide mimotope
equivalent. early biochemical studies have shown
that excessive modiÂ®cation of antibody lysine residues prevents antigen recognition (cobbold et al.,
1990). this was thought to have abolished binding
as a result of interference with a speciÂ®c charge
interaction which, with reference to the structure
presented here, would be lys53h. an equally
valid explanation, however, could be that the
modiÂ®cation interfered with the membrane-cdr
charge complementarity.
an alternative route to prevent immune
response against antibody therapy is to pre-tolerise
with a non-binding mutant. recent studies by gilliland & walsh demonstrate the successful application of this approach in  xxxg393xxx  transgenic mice
(gilliland et al., 1999). it was noted, however, that
some mice were still able to mount anti-globulin
responses against the wild-type antibody. even in
single residue mutants there may be a gap in tolerance between tolerogen and wild-type. now that
the complexed structure is known, a complete
panel of minimal mutants for all important residues could be created to Â®nd one in which the residue difference occurs in a region that is not
presented on mhc, or has low afÂ®nity for the
tcr. alternatively, two such mutants could be
identiÂ®ed; one in each of the light and heavy
chains, so covering all possibilities.
there are a number of other known antibodies
against  xxxg393xxx  with differing afÂ®nities for the antigen (hale & waldmann, 1994). the structural basis
for this difference is unknown and work is in progress to crystallise a high and a low-afÂ®nity clone.
such a comparison would reveal what changes can
be made to improve binding and perhaps increase
the effectiveness of  xxxd107xxx  in therapy. the
importance of  xxxd107xxx  both prophylactically in transplantation and therapeutically in a

wide range of autoimmune disorders drives continued research into the development of improved
antibodies and treatment strategies. there is no
doubt that over the next few years new applications for this versatile antibody will continue to
emerge and that the detailed structural work presented here will guide future engineering, speeding
the transition from laboratory to clinic and ultimately to the patient.

grown in a hollow Â®bre fermentor (acusyst-jr, cellex inc,

was removed using an rprotein a hi-trap column (pharmacia). enzyme contaminants and partial digestion products were removed following cation exchange on an sp

using scala giving a Â®nal merging r-factor rmeas of
6.2 %. the  xxxd107xxx  structure was determined
using molecular replacement (amore, navaza, 1994),
Ãª native structure as the search model
with the 3.2 a
(cheetham et al., 1998). the initial rigid-body solution
gave a correlation coefÂ®cient of 0.65 and an r-factor of
37.2 %. the structure was reÂ®ned over successive rounds
using the program refmac (murshudov et al., 1997),
with re-building in o (jones & kjeldgaard, 1993); the
heptapeptide and heavy chain loop h134-h143 were

built into 10 % omit maps (see table 1). as expected at
Ãª , density was of excellent quality for residues 1 to
1.9 a
211 of the light chain and 1 to 220 of the heavy chain
present in the model. density for the mimotope allowed
unequivocal placement of all peptide residues (p0-p7;
see figure 2). the Â®nal model was reÂ®ned to an r-factor
of 20.8 % and an r-free of 26.5 % (see table 1). all residues are located in either energetically favoured or
allowed regions on a ramachandran plot with the exception of thr51l. this residue forms part of a classic gturn, which explains the unfavourable phi-psi values.
the conformations of the cdr loops are all of canonical
structure type 1 (chothia & lesk, 1987).
structure analysis
as  xxxd107xxx  was originally engineered using
sequence-deÂ®ned kabat cdrs, all structural analysis
refers to this deÂ®nition. least-squares superimpositions
were calculated in the ccp4 programme lsqman, with
r.m.s.d. calculations of cdr loops made after superimposing c-alpha co-ordinates of framework residues: vl
10-12, 17-24, 34-38, 46-48, 53-55, 62-65, 71-76, 86-90, 98104 and vh 4-9, 17-24, 36-40, 46-50, 56-59, 67-71, 90-94,
105-110. accessible surface area statistics were calculated
Ãª probe using programmes resarea, surwith a 1.4 a
face and areaimol. contacts were calculated with a
Ãª cut-off in the programme contacts. surface
3.6 a
charge models were created in grasp (nicholls &
honig, 1991), and secondary structure Â®gures were
constructed using setor (evans, 1993), and bobscript
(esnouf, 1997). structure validation, including ramachandran plots, was conducted using procheck
(laskowski et al., 1993).
