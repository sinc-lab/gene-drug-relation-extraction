probenecid is a well-established drug for the treatment of gout and is
thought to act on an organic anion transporter, thereby affecting uric
acid excretion in the kidney by blocking urate reuptake. probenecid
also has been shown to affect atp release, leading to the suggestion
that atp release involves an organic anion transporter. other pharmacological evidence and the observation of dye uptake, however,
suggest that the nonvesicular release of atp is mediated by large
membrane channels, with  xxxg1664xxx  being a prominent candidate. in
the present study we show that probenecid inhibited currents mediated
by  xxxg1664xxx  channels in the same concentration range as observed
for inhibition of transport processes. probenecid did not affect channels formed by connexins. thus probenecid allows for discrimination
between channels formed by connexins and pannexins.
connexin; transport; erythrocyte; atp release
probenecid has been used for decades for the treatment of gout.
the mechanism of action of the drug is inhibition of a renal
tubular transporter, thereby facilitating the excretion of the
disease causative  xxxd3472xxx  by blocking reuptake (5, 26, 37).
probenecid-sensitive transporters are widespread and are even
found in plants (30, 31, 44, 52, 56). the inhibition of the
transporter by probenecid is also exploited clinically to increase the effective concentrations of antibiotics, chemotherapeutics, and other medications.
the inhibitory effect of probenecid on organic anion transporters is well established, and the effect is thought to be so
specific that the drug is often used as a diagnostic tool, i.e., its
effect is typically interpreted as an involvement of an anion
transporter in the tested parameter. accordingly, block of
camp or cgmp release from erythrocytes (18, 25), atp
release from glia cells (1, 17), and block of dye loss in various
cell types (20, 21, 23) by probenecid have been presented as
evidence for a role of transporters in these phenomena. however, alternative pathways for the transit of these molecules
across the plasma membrane have to be considered. besides
the well-documented vesicular release of atp, a parallel release through membrane channels must exist, because the
release is attenuated by drugs that do not interfere with vesicular release but affect gap junction proteins and because atp
release in several cell types is associated with uptake of dye
from the extracellular medium (13).
special attention has to be given to  xxxg1664xxx  as an atp
release channel because of the specific properties of pannexin
1 channels and because of the expression pattern of pannexin
1 (2, 16, 28, 32–34, 55, 59).  xxxg1664xxx  channels are highly
permeable to atp and to dyes typically used for dye flux

measurements through gap junction channels. these dyes are
in the same size range as the ca2⫹ indicator dyes whose loss is
attenuated by probenecid.  xxxg1664xxx  channels also are mechanosensitive, consistent with a role in ca2⫹ wave initiation.
expression of  xxxg1664xxx  is found in cells exhibiting atp
release, including erythrocytes, endothelial cells, and astrocytes. furthermore, the localization at the luminal membrane in
epithelial cells is consistent with an atp release function of
 xxxg1664xxx  channels.
we therefore tested whether probenecid affects  xxxg1664xxx 
channels in addition to the drug’s action on anion transporters.
we also tested the effects of 5-nitro-2(3-phenylpropylamino) xxxd306xxx  ( xxxg1585xxx ) on  xxxg1664xxx  channels.  xxxg1585xxx  is known
as a chloride channel blocker and also has been described to
block atp release from ciliary epithelial cells (36, 45) and
mouse mammary cells (47). the results of the present study
indicate that probenecid is a powerful inhibitor of  xxxg1664xxx 
channels. in contrast, connexin channels were not affected
by probenecid.  xxxg1585xxx  inhibited both pannexin and connexin
channels.
methods

preparation of oocytes. xenopus laevis oocytes were prepared as
previously described (15). briefly, oocytes were isolated by incubating segments of surgically removed ovary in 2 mg/ml collagenase
type i (worthington biochemical) in ca2⫹-free oocyte ringer solution (or2; in mm: 82.5 nacl, 2.5 kcl, 1.0 mgcl2, 1.0 cacl2, 1.0
na2hpo4, and 5.0 hepes, ph 7.5) with antibiotics (10,000 u/ml
penicillin and 10 mg/ml streptomycin) and stirring at 1 turn/s for 3 h
at room temperature. after being thoroughly washed with regular
or2, oocytes devoid of follicle cells and having a uniform pigmentation were selected and stored in or2 at 18°c.
mrna and electrophysiology. mrna for  xxxg1664xxx , connexin46
(cx46), or cx32e143 were prepared using the mmessage mmachine
in vitro transcription kit (ambion). oocytes were injected with 20 – 40
nl of mrna (100 –1,000 ng/ml) and incubated for 18 – 42 h at 18°c.
oocytes expressing cx46 or cx32e143 were incubated in or2 plus 5
mm cacl2 to prevent the channels from opening during the incubation. oocytes were tested using two-electrode voltage clamp (model
oc725c, warner instruments, or geneclamp 500b, axon instruments) under constant perfusion according to the protocols described.
electrophysiology data are shown as means ⫾ se or as box plots.
preparation of erythrocytes. xenopus blood was collected into
or2 plus 5 mm egta, ph 7.5, and spun at low speed. the buffy coat
(the thin layer of cells atop the packed erythrocytes) was removed, and
erythrocytes were washed three times with or2 plus 5 mm glucose
and then resuspended at 20% hematocrit. cells were diluted into or2
without antibiotics for use in dye uptake assays.
dye uptake. erythrocytes (75 ␮l) at 0.1% hematocrit in or2
were plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated 96-well plates (biocoat,
becton dickinson). or2 alone (25 ␮l) or with the addition of 4

with or2 or potassium gluconate in the presence of 150 or 500 ␮m
probenecid. oocytes were 4 days postinjection. pannexin expression
and cell viability were confirmed electrophysiologically. cells were
pretreated for 10 min with probenecid, where applicable, and then
isolated for 10 min in 150 ␮l of the experimental solutions. supernatant (100 ␮l) was obtained for each condition. each condition was
done in quintuplicate. luminescence readings were obtained with a
victor 1420 multilabel counter (perkinelmer) on a 96-well culture
plate.

all other chemicals used were obtained from sigma-aldrich.
results

 xxxg1664xxx , although originally discovered as a “gap junction protein,” rather than forming cell-to-cell channels exerts
its physiological role as a freestanding, unapposed membrane
channel allowing the flux of molecules between the cytoplasm
and the extracellular space (2, 8, 9, 12, 16, 28, 39, 42). the
channel can be opened at the resting membrane potential by
mechanical stress, by an increase in cytoplasmic ca2⫹ concentration, or by atp through p2y or p2x7 receptors (2, 33, 34).
experimentally, the channel also can be opened by applied
voltage pulses (2, 12). the activation of the channel by voltage
is probably nonphysiological, because positive potentials are
required for the channel to open. however, because of the
experimental convenience, we used this paradigm for channel
opening.
figure 1 shows that the organic anion transport inhibitor
probenecid attenuates currents induced by voltage steps in
 xxxg1664xxx -expressing oocytes in a dose-dependant fashion.
figure 2 shows the dose-response curve for the effect of
probenecid on  xxxg1664xxx  channel currents. at 1 mm concentration, probenecid completely abolished the currents. in the
micromolar range, a steep slope for the probenecid effect was
observed with an ic50 of ⬃150 ␮m (fig. 2). curiously, at
concentrations below 1 ␮m, a small (⬍10%) dose-dependent
inhibition of the currents was detectable. at these low concentrations, an adaptive phenomenon was observed (fig. 1b,
bottom trace) that was not prominent at higher drug concentrations. probably there is more than one binding site for
probenecid.
the chloride channel blocker  xxxg1585xxx  has been shown to
block atp release from erythrocytes, mouse mammary cells,
and ciliary epithelial cells (36, 45, 47). erythrocytes express
high levels of  xxxg1664xxx , and atp release from these cells is
correlated with dye uptake and attenuated by the pannexin
inhibitor  xxxd433xxx  (32). to test whether the effect of
 xxxg1585xxx  on atp release could be attributable to  xxxg1664xxx

channels, we tested  xxxg1585xxx  on oocytes expressing  xxxg1664xxx . a
dose-dependent inhibition of currents carried by  xxxg1664xxx 
channels was observed (fig. 1c). in contrast to probenecid but
similar to  xxxd433xxx ,  xxxg1585xxx  inhibited the  xxxg1664xxx -mediated currents incompletely, leaving a residual current of
⬃20%. the dose-response curve (fig. 2) shows that  xxxg1585xxx ,
with an ic50 of ⬃50 ␮m, was more potent, although less
efficacious, than probenecid in attenuating  xxxg1664xxx  channel
currents.
to test whether the effects of the two drugs are additive, we
applied probenecid and  xxxg1585xxx  concurrently, first one drug and
then both. figure 3 shows that at lower concentrations, the
effects of the drugs did not add arithmetically. at high concentrations,  xxxg1585xxx  left a residual current that remained unaffected by the addition of probenecid at a concentration that
abolished the current when given alone. thus it appears that
the drugs act competitively on  xxxg1664xxx  channels. a final
assessment of the nature of the drug interaction, however,
needs to await single-channel studies.

1 channel currents. as shown previously (2, 3), uninjected
oocytes exhibit a moderate increase in atp release when
stimulated with high potassium levels (fig. 7). the atp
release based on endogenous mechanisms in oocytes has been
reported to be vesicular in nature because of its brefeldin
sensitivity (35).
discussion

the data presented demonstrate that probenecid, which has
been used for decades clinically for treatment of chronic gout,
has an additional or alternative target heretofore known. it is
well accepted that probenecid blocks organic anion transport
(7, 14, 19). accordingly, the mechanism of action of the drug

and 0.9 for  xxxg1585xxx . mpanx1, mouse  xxxg1664xxx .

the effect of  xxxg1585xxx  is not specific to  xxxg1664xxx  channels. a
similar inhibition of membrane currents by  xxxg1585xxx  was observed in oocytes expressing cx46 and cx32e143 (fig. 4). the
vertebrate gap junction proteins cx46 and cx50, when expressed in oocytes, form patent nonjunctional membrane channels in addition to gap junction channels (4, 40). such channel
formation also is observed in oocytes expressing the chimera
cx32e143, where in a cx32 background the sequence of the
first extracellular loop is replaced by that of  xxxg895xxx  (43). membrane currents in oocytes expressing either cx46 or cx32e143
were not affected by probenecid even at high concentrations
but were affected by  xxxg1585xxx  in a way similar to  xxxg1664xxx 
channels (figs. 4 and 5).
probenecid and  xxxg1585xxx  have been reported to inhibit the
release of camp and of atp from erythrocytes and glia cells.
human erythrocytes express  xxxg1664xxx  at high levels (32). we
tested whether the drugs affect the release of atp and the
correlated uptake of extracellular dyes by erythrocytes in the
same concentration range as they inhibit  xxxg1664xxx -mediated
currents in oocytes. we choose frog erythrocytes because the
presence of nuclei in these cells allows for the convenient
measurement of dye uptake with yopro. this compound is
barely fluorescent in aqueous solution, and fluorescence
intensity increases ⬃2,000-fold on binding of the dye to
dna and rna.
erythrocytes from various species, including human, release
atp and take up dye in a low-oxygen environment, when
mechanically stressed, or when depolarized with a high concentration of potassium gluconate (6, 32, 50). figure 6 shows
that the osmotic stress-induced uptake of yopro from the
extracellular space by frog erythrocytes was inhibited by probenecid.
 xxxg1664xxx  channels mediate the release of atp from
oocytes expressing the protein exogenously (2). to test
whether the release is sensitive to probenecid, we determined
efflux of atp from oocytes expressing  xxxg1664xxx  by performing a luminometric luciferase assay. figure 7 shows that the
high-potassium-induced atp release was attenuated by probenecid in a dose range matching that of the effects on pannexin

probenecid inhibits  xxxg1664xxx  channels

drug either affects  xxxg1664xxx  channels and the transporters as
separate entities or  xxxg1664xxx  is part of a transport protein
complex providing the permeation pathway. in any case, transport claims for many phenomena based on probenecid effects
have to be reevaluated in light of the present finding, in
particular where a transport process was only inferred from the
drug action.
how probenecid accesses and affects the  xxxg1664xxx  channel
is unclear. although hydrophobic in nature, the drug is sufficiently water soluble to prepare aqueous stock solutions. the
drug, therefore, may interact either with hydrophilic aspects of
the protein or may access the channel through the lipid bilayer.
pannexins were discovered as a second family of vertebrate
“gap junction proteins” based on the limited sequence homology to the innexins found in invertebrates (39). however,
presently there is no evidence that pannexins actually form gap
junction channels in vivo (8, 16, 28, 32, 42). instead, these
proteins seem to exert their physiological role exclusively as
nonjunctional membrane channels providing a pathway for
exchange of molecules between the cytoplasm and extracellular space (16). most drugs acting as “gap junction blockers” do
not discriminate among connexins, pannexins, and innexins.
the only somewhat discriminating agent is  xxxd433xxx ,
which requires a slightly lower concentration to affect
pannexin channels than connexin channels (11). probenecid,
therefore, is the first drug with specificity for channels formed
by pannexins.  xxxg1585xxx  is unspecific in its effect on gap junction
proteins, as are all the others of the lot, including flufenamic
 xxxd2723xxx  acid, and higher alcohols.

from astrocytes and other cells in the absence of other known

are shown. a: probenecid does not affect connexin-based membrane channels.
at concentrations exceeding those resulting in total inhibition of  xxxg1664xxx 
channels, probenecid did not affect currents through cx46 or cx32e143
channels. b: currents through cx46 and cx32e143 channels were inhibited by
 xxxg1585xxx  similarly to the  xxxg1664xxx  channel currents. because of different
activation kinetics, the oocytes expressing connexins were held at depolarized
potentials well below the equilibrium potential for potassium. therefore,
closure of the channels resulted in a considerable baseline shift.

presumably by an anion transporter.
in the present report, however, we show that probenecid
inhibits  xxxg1664xxx  channels that have no known relationship
with transporters. inhibition of  xxxg1664xxx  channels by probenecid has an ic50 of ⬃150 ␮m, similar to that seen for
inhibition of various transporters, including the human urate
transporter hurat1 (10, 46, 54, 57, 58). considering the
established effect on organic anion transport by probenecid, the

considered as an alternative, especially in light of the properties of  xxxg1664xxx  channels. they are highly permeable to
atp, activated at the resting membrane potential by mechanical stress, by extracellular atp through p2y or p2x7 receptors, and by increases in cytoplasmic ca2⫹ concentration (2,
31, 32). thus  xxxg1664xxx  channels are ideally suited to exert
the role of atp release channels in the initiation and propagation of intercellular ca2⫹ waves. furthermore, the expression pattern of  xxxg1664xxx , including luminal localization, is
consistent with such a function.
additional support for that role also comes from the abundant expression of  xxxg1664xxx  in erythrocytes. erythrocytes
release atp in response to shear stress or in a low-oxygen
environment as part of a peripheral control loop of oxygen
delivery (6, 50). under conditions of atp release, erythrocytes
take up dyes from the extracellular medium (32), and as shown
in the present study, such dye uptake is inhibited by probenecid. similarly, atp release from oocytes expressing pannexin
1 is attenuated by probenecid in the same concentration range
as the inhibition of  xxxg1664xxx  channel currents. these observations lend further support for a role of the pannexon, the
hexameric assembly of pannexins forming a channel (8), as an
atp release channel.
intercellular ca2⫹ waves propagate through gap junction
channels (48) and by an extracellular pathway involving atp
release and activation of purinergic receptors (27, 38). typically, this phenomenon is studied with ca2⫹-sensitive indicator
dyes. the dyes are loaded into the cells in the form of

probenecid inhibits  xxxg1664xxx  channels

membrane permeant esters, which are cleaved by cytoplasmic
esterases. although the cleavage product is essentially membrane impermeant, a gradual loss of dye is observed nevertheless. to prevent dye leakage, it is common practice to use
probenecid in these studies with the assumption that the drug
will inhibit an organic anion transporter responsible for dye
loss (20, 22, 51). this practice has implications and will bias
the experimental data toward gap junction-mediated wave
propagation because these channels are not affected by probenecid (24). the practice of using probenecid also biases the
experimental data toward vesicular release of atp by attenuating, if not eliminating,  xxxg1664xxx -mediated atp release.
in most cell types, with erythrocytes representing a notable
vesicle-free exception, atp release involves two parallel pathways. there is overwhelming evidence for vesicular release,
including copackaging of atp with other transmitters (49, 53)
and sensitivity to brefeldin (35). a series of observations,
however, indicates that an additional, channel-based atp release mechanism must exist. for example, the dye uptake by
cells from the extracellular space under conditions of atp
release cannot be explained by a vesicular release mechanism
but is consistent with a channel release process. furthermore,
a series of drugs that do not affect exocytosis attenuate atp
release. although most of the drugs are not very specific in
their action on channels, all of them inhibit  xxxg1664xxx  channels, most notably  xxxd433xxx , probenecid, and  xxxg1585xxx . in
summary, these data lend more support for an atp release
channel role for  xxxg1664xxx .
 xxxg1664xxx , through its interaction with the p2x7 receptor, is
involved in the activation of the inflammasome, a protein
platform that in turn converts interleukin-1␤ to its releasable
form (29, 33, 41). inflammation is at the root of gout. thus it
appears that probenecid may benefit gout patients in more than
one way. in addition to the lowering of systemic  xxxd3472xxx  by
its action on tubular transport in the kidney, probenecid may
stem inflammation through its inhibition of  xxxg1664xxx 
channels.
