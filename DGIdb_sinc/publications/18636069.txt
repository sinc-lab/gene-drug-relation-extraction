effects of the antioxidative beta-blocker  xxxd458xxx  on
endothelial progenitor cells in hypertensive rats
background
endothelial progenitor cells (epcs) derived from bone marrow
migrate to areas of endothelial damage and repair them. epc
function is impaired by oxidative stress. we examined the effects of an
antioxidative  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor blocker on the number and function
of epcs in hypertensive rats.
methods
spontaneously hypertensive rats (shrs) and wistar–kyoto
(wky) rats were fed diets loaded with high salt. the shrs were
treated with  xxxd458xxx  or atenolol for 2 weeks. peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (mncs) were separated, subjected to flow
cytometric analysis to determine the number of circulating
epcs, and cultured to quantify epc colony formation. epc
migration was evaluated in migration assay chambers. epc
senescence was evaluated using beta-galactosidase assay. oxidative
stress of epcs was evaluated using thiobarbituric acid–reactive
substance (tbars) assay. the expression of nicotinamine adenine

dinucleotide phosphate (nad(p)h) oxidase component mrnas in the
renal cortex, aorta, and heart were evaluated by real-time pcr.
results
the number, colony formation, and migration of epcs in shrs were
significantly lower than those in wky rats. tbars scores in epcs from
shrs were significantly higher than those from wky rats.  xxxd458xxx 
increased the number of circulating epcs and stimulated epc
colony formation and migration, while decreasing epc senescence.
 xxxd458xxx  inhibited oxidation in epcs from shrs, and decreased
the expression of nad(p)h oxidase component mrnas in the renal
cortex, aorta, and heart.
conclusion
epcs are impaired in shrs in response to oxidative stress.  xxxd458xxx 
decreases oxidative stress in hypertension in vivo and improves epc
numbers and function. it appears, therefore, that  xxxd458xxx  may exert
beneficial cardiovascular effects through its antioxidative properties.

beta-adrenoceptor blockers (beta-blockers) are a group of drugs
that are widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases including arterial hypertension. the therapeutic
effects of beta-blockers are explained by their capacity to block
beta-adrenoceptors, thereby inhibiting the effects of the endogenous agonists, noradrenaline and adrenaline.1 the beneficial
cardiovascular effects of some beta-blockers have been shown to
be associated with their antioxidant properties. propranolol
has been reported to combat oxidative stress through its
antioxidant activity, and to reduce tissue lipid peroxidation.2
recent studies have shown that carvedilol acts as a free radical
scavenger to decrease lipid peroxidation in patients with heart
failure.3 it has also been reported that  xxxd458xxx  decreases the

production of superoxide anions in patients with essential
hypertension4 and improves endothelial function.5 in contrast,
treatment with atenolol has no effect on the excessive production of reactive oxygen ­species (ros) in endothelial cells.6
these studies indicate that only certain beta-blockers act as effective antioxidants. the excessive production of ros is the root
mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular diseases. it follows, therefore, that
the antioxidant action of beta-blockers might contribute to their
beneficial effects in the context of cardiovascular diseases.
hypertension can result in cardiovascular complications
such as stroke and ischemic heart disease, which are associated
with arterial damage. although cardiovascular risk f­ actors such
as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus primarily cause vascular injury, including endothelial damage, it is
believed that abnormalities in the repair of endothelial damage
enhance vascular injury. endothelial progenitor cells (epcs)
derived from bone marrow represent up to 0.01% of cells in the
peripheral blood. epcs migrate to areas of endothelial damage
and repair them, and this would suggest that epc dysfunction
determines the eventual level of vascular injury.7 hill et al.8
reported that epc dysfunction is closely correlated with vascular

animals and experimental design. experiments were performed on 12-week-old male wistar–kyoto (wky)/izm rats
and shrs/izms (shr, hamamatsu, shizuoka, japan). all procedures described in this study were approved by the animal
experimentation committee of the nihon university school
of medicine. the rats were housed (three per cage) under
controlled conditions of temperature, humidity, and light,
and had unrestricted access to water. wky rats (n = 6) and
shrs (n = 18) received a high-salt diet (8% nacl) for 2 weeks,
and shrs that had been fed a high-salt diet were randomly
assigned to one of three groups: (i) untreated shrs (n = 6);
(ii) shrs treated with atenolol (sigma-aldrich, st. louis,
mo) (n = 6); and (iii) shrs treated with  xxxd458xxx  (nippon
shinyaku, kyoto, japan) (n = 6). the first group received only
drinking water; the second group received atenolol (25 mg/kg/
day) dissolved in drinking water, for 2 weeks; and the third
group received  xxxd458xxx  (50 mg/kg/day) dissolved in drinking
water, for 2 weeks.
systolic blood pressure and heart rate were measured weekly
in the mornings throughout the 2-week period using the tailcuff method and a blood pressure monitor (model bo-98a;
softron, tokyo, japan). the average of three successive readings
was recorded. the rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal
sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) after 2 weeks, and the kidneys,
aorta, and heart were flushed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered
saline and removed immediately. kidney cortex, aorta, and heart
were stored at −80 °c until use in rna extraction.
blood samples were collected through a needle inserted
directly into the heart prior to, and at 1 and 2 weeks after the
start of the treatments. plasma aldosterone concentration
(pac) and plasma renin activity (pra) were measured by
radioimmunoassay (srl, tokyo, japan).
epc colony formation assay. a modified epc colony formation assay was performed as described previously.10 in
brief, the rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal sodium
pentobarbital (50 mg/kg), and 10 ml of heparinized peripheral blood was collected through the hepatic p
­ ortal vein.
mononuclear cells (mncs) were separated in histopaque-1083
­density-gradient medium (sigma-aldrich). the mncs were
suspended and mixed in 1 ml endothelial growth medium-2
american journal of hypertension | volume 21 number 9 | september 2008

(clonetics, san diego, ca) containing 10% fetal bovine
serum, human  xxxg787xxx , vascular
endothelial growth factor, recombinant i­ nsulin-like growth
factor-1, human  xxxg681xxx , and  xxxd228xxx 
(clonetics). twenty-four-well plates (bd biosciences, san
jose, ca) were precoated with rat  xxxg2422xxx  (0.1 mug/cm2)
plus 0.5% gelatin overnight at 37 °c. the mncs were
inoculated onto six-well plates (5 × 106 cells/well) and cultured for 24 h. nonadherent mncs were reinoculated onto
­ xxxg2422xxx -coated plates (2 × 106 cells/well) and cultured in
a co2 incubator at 37 °c for 7 days. the average number of
colonies was calculated manually under a microscope from
a minimum of four wells by an observer who was unaware of
the experimental design.
flow cytometric analysis for epcs. we determined the number
of circulating epcs in peripheral blood using cell-surface antigen as previously established.11 circulating mncs with cd34+
were tentatively quantified as epcs. peripheral blood was drawn
and the mncs were isolated using a density-gradient centrifuge method. the mncs were stained with a fluorescein isothiocyanate–conjugated anti-cd34 monoclonal antibody (bd
biosciences). samples were subjected to a 2d side-scatter–­
fluorescence dot plot analysis (facscan; bd biosciences). after
appropriate gating, the number of cd34+ cells with low cytoplasmic granularity (low sideward scatter) was quantified and
expressed as the number of cells per 104 total events.
epc migration assay. in order to investigate epc migration
activity, a modified boyden chamber assay was performed
with a 96-well microchemotaxis chamber (neuro probe,
gaithersburg, md) as described previously.12 in brief, after
inoculation onto six-well plates for 24 h, nonadherent mncs
were resuspended in endothelial basic medium-2 (clonetics).
chemotaxis assays were performed in 96-microwell
­chemotaxis chambers (neuro probe) with 5-mum pore size,
vitrogen (cohesion technologies (palo alto, ca))-coated
polycarbonate filters (neuro probe). the same medium,
­containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 ng/ml stromal-derived
factor 1 (r&d systems, minneapolis, mn), 50 ng/ml ­vascular
endothelial growth factor-a (r&d systems), and 0.1% bovine
 xxxg124xxx  (negative control) was applied to the lower
compartment, and cells were adjusted to 5 × 104 cell/ml and
applied to the upper compartment. after incubating in a
co2 incubator at 37 °c for 24 h, the filter was removed, and
cells that migrated to the filter were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed, stained with diff-quick (sysmex
international reagents co., ltd., tokyo, japan), and counted
under a microscope at ×40 magnification. the number of
migrated cells in the treated samples minus the number of
cells migrated in ­negative controls was counted. all assays
were performed at least in triplicate.
senescence-associated beta-galactosidase assay. senescenceassociated beta-galactosidase assay was performed as previously
described.12 in brief, attached mncs in endothelial basic

injury and endothelial function in the context of various cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and smoking. the mechanisms underlying epc
dysfunction in hypertension have not yet been determined. it
has been reported that the life spans (cell cycles) of stem cells,
including those of epcs, are decreased by oxidative stress.9
therefore it is possible that oxidative stress induces endothelial
damage by decreasing the life span and/or function of epcs.
in order to investigate whether antioxidative beta-blockers
exert beneficial effects on epcs, the in vivo effects of  xxxd458xxx 
on oxidative stress and the number and function of epcs were
studied in high-salt–loaded spontaneously hypertensive rats
(shrs).

real-time pcr. total rna was isolated from rat kidney, aorta,
and heart using isogen reagent (nippon gene, toyama, japan)
in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. aliquots of
total rna were reverse transcribed into single-stranded complementary dna by incubating with avian myeloblastoma virus
reverse transcriptase (takara bio, shiga, japan). measurements
of tissue complementary dna levels were performed by realtime pcr using a prism 7500 sequence detection system
(applied biosystems, foster city, ca). all of the probes and
primers were assays-on-demand gene expression products
(p22phox, rn00577357_ml;  xxxg1508xxx , rn00586945_ml; gp91phox,
rn00576710_ml; and taqman rodent  xxxg861xxx  control reagents;
applied biosystems). each reaction mixture consisted of 12.5 mul
taqman universal pcr master mix (applied biosystems), 50 ng
complementary dna template, and 1.25 mul specific probe/primer
mixed in a total volume of 25 mul. the amplification conditions
were: 50 °c for 2 min and 95 °c for 10 min followed by 60 cycles
of denaturation (95 °c for 15 s) and combined annealing/extension (60 °c for 1 min). the threshold cycle (ct) was subsequently
determined. relative quantification of marker gene mrna
expression was carried out using the comparative ct method.13
relative quantification values of the target, normalized to ­values
of an endogenous control (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene) and relative to a calibrator were expressed as
2-deltadeltact (fold difference).

acid–reactive substance (tbars) in mncs was measured
using an oxi-tek tbars assay kit (zeptometrix, buffalo, ny).
in brief, mncs (106/100 mul) were mixed with 100 mul sodium
dodecyl sulfonate solution. tba/buffer reagent was prepared
by mixing 0.5 g thiobarbituric acid with 50 ml acetic acid and
50 ml naoh. tba/buffer reagent (2.5 ml) was added to 200 mul
sample/ xxxd3215xxx  mixture and incubated at
95 °c in capped tubes for 60 min. the samples were cooled to
room temperature in an ice bath for 10 min and centrifuged at
3,000 r.p.m. for 15 min. the supernatants were removed, and
fluorescence intensity was measured in semi-microcuvettes
in a fluorometer (bio-rad laboratories, hercules, ca). the

hypertension causes endothelial dysfunction and v­ ascular
remodeling, which may be associated with ­abnormalities
in the repair of endothelial damage. stem and progenitor cells are critical for organogenesis during fetal development. recently, the existence of somatic stem cells has been
reported in adult organs; these cells are thought to migrate
to and repair damaged tissues and organs. epcs have potential to differentiate into mature functional endothelial cells.
in adults, circulating epcs localize to sites of neovascularization and differentiate into endothelial cells.14,15 the repair of
injured vessel walls and the generation of new blood vessels
require stem cells or epcs.16 epcs circulate in the peripheral
blood and are directly exposed to systemic oxidative stresses
in hypertension. it has been reported that the pro-oxidant
conditions associated with hypertension may determine epc
function and fate.17
in this study, we show that the oxidative stress levels in
mncs from shrs was significantly greater than in those from
wky rats. the pathogenesis of hypertension is strongly associated with an increased production of tissue  xxxg99xxx 
(ang ii).18 increased ang ii in hypertension directly induces
increases in blood pressure and cardiovascular damage by
increasing the production of growth factors and ­oxidative
stress. oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis
of ang ii–related hypertension.19 ang ii, acting through the
ang ii type i receptor, stimulates nad(p)h oxidase, induces
oxidative stress, and alters endothelial cell function.20 in this
study, we show that mrna expression of nad(p)h ­oxidase
components such as gp91phox, p22phox, and  xxxg1508xxx  was
increased in heart, aorta, and renal cortex in salt-loaded shrs.
ros are produced in the cardiovascular system by v­ arious cell
types, including endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells,
adventitial fibroblasts, and macrophages, p
­ rimarily through
the production of superoxide radical (o2−). in the cardiovascular system, o2− is produced in large part by the enzyme
nad(p)h oxidase.21 by this mechanism, oxidative stress is
increased in salt-loaded shrs.
the life span of stem and progenitor cells, including epcs,
has been reported to be shortened by oxidative stress,22 and
the functions of epcs, such as migration, may be critically
influenced by the redox equilibrium state.23 oxidative stress
is involved in telomere shortening, which influences ­cellular
life span.24 studies of neural progenitor cells have shown
that factors that promote self-renewal cause these cells to
enter a decreased redox state, whereas exposure to ­factors
that p
­ romote differentiation leads to excess oxidation.25 it
­follows, therefore, that oxidation may be involved in the
­balance between self-renewal and differentiation. the redox
balance changes as cells mature, suggesting that antioxidants
may play major roles in the preservation of characteristics of

stem cells and progenitor cells. the functions of epcs, such
as migration, affect the patient’s recovery after cell transplantation.26 imanishi et al.27 reported that exposure of epcs to
oxidized low-density lipoprotein significantly accelerate epc
­senescence, diminish telomerase activity, and impair epc
­proliferative capacity and network formation. we have demonstrated that the formation and function of epcs are impaired
by oxidative stress, and that arbs improve the proliferation
and function of epcs in hypertensive rats.7,28 these findings
suggest that the biochemical basis of epc dysfunction involves
excessive oxidative stress, and that epcs that are subjected to
the unfavorable environment of oxidative stress may undergo
senescence or apoptosis.
in this study we also show that  xxxd458xxx , but not atenolol,
decreases the elevated tbars score in mncs from shrs,
thereby suggesting that  xxxd458xxx  decreases oxidative stress
in hypertension. in addition,  xxxd458xxx , but not atenolol,
significantly inhibits the increased mrna expression of
nad(p)h oxidase components. this finding would suggest that  xxxd458xxx  may reduce the production of ros in
salt-loaded shrs by suppressing nad(p)h oxidase expression. the ability of  xxxd458xxx  to inhibit oxidative stress has
been evaluated in various in vivo studies. kobayashi et al.29
reported that  xxxd458xxx  inhibits nad(p)h oxidase expression and decreases production of h2o2 in deoxycorticosterone acetate/salt-hypertensive rats. in addition,  xxxd458xxx  has
been reported to decrease production of superoxide anions
in patients with essential hypertension,4 whereas atenolol
had no effect on excessive ros production in endothelial
cells.6 therefore our findings, together with those of others,
strongly suggest that  xxxd458xxx  is an effective antioxidant for
use in hypertension.
both  xxxd458xxx  and atenolol were shown to reduce blood
pressure to similar levels; however, only  xxxd458xxx , but not
atenolol, markedly enhanced epc numbers and function.
this finding would suggest that the beneficial effect of  xxxd458xxx  on epcs is independent of its effect on blood pressure. the number and function of epcs from shrs were
lower than those in epcs from wky rats.  xxxd458xxx  did
not affect the levels of pac and pra, thereby indicating
that the improvement in epc colony formation by  xxxd458xxx 
is not associated with the suppression of pac and pra. in
addition, the proportion of senescence-associated cells was
significantly higher in shrs than in wky rats. these data
suggest that the decreases in epc number were associated
with apoptosis and senescence by oxidative stress in shrs.
 xxxd458xxx  effectively increased epc number and colony
formation, stimulated epc migration, and decreased epc
senescence with reduction of oxidative stress.
in conclusion, the results of this study show that epc
number and function are decreased in hypertension, and
that this is associated with oxidative stress.  xxxd458xxx  may
increase epc number and function by suppressing epc
senescence and apoptosis through reduction of oxidative
stress in h
­ ypertension, thereby adding to its beneficial cardiovascular effects. the use of  xxxd458xxx  as a conventional
