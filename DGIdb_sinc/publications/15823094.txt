folding pathway of the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate c-s lyase maly from escherichia coli.  maly from escherichia coli is a bifunctional dimeric plp (pyridoxal 5'-phosphate) enzyme acting as a beta-cystathionase and as a repressor of the maltose system. the spectroscopic and molecular properties of the holoenzyme, in the untreated and nabh4-treated forms, and of the apoenzyme have been elucidated. a systematic study of the urea-induced unfolding of maly has been monitored by gel filtration, cross-linking, ans (8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulphonic acid) binding and by visible, near- and far-uv cd, fluorescence and nmr spectroscopies under equilibrium conditions. unfolding proceeds in at least three stages. the first transition, occurring between 0 and 1 m urea, gives rise to a partially active dimeric species that binds plp. the second equilibrium transition involving dimer dissociation, release of plp and loss of lyase activity leads to the formation of a monomeric equilibrium intermediate. it is a partially unfolded molecule that retains most of the native-state secondary structure, binds significant amounts of ans (a probe for exposed hydrophobic surfaces) and tends to self-associate. the self-associated aggregates predominate at urea concentrations of 2-4 m for holomaly. the third step represents the complete unfolding of the enzyme. these results when compared with the urea-induced unfolding profiles of apomaly and nabh4-reduced holoenzyme suggest that the coenzyme group attached to the active-site lysine residue increases the stability of the dimeric enzyme. both holo- and apo-maly could be successfully refolded into the active enzyme with an 85% yield. further refolding studies suggest that large misfolded soluble aggregates that cannot be refolded could be responsible for the incomplete re-activation.
