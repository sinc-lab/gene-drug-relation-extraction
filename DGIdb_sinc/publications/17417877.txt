abstract: beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ar) are potential targets for antidepressants. desensitization and
downregulation of beta-ar are discussed as possible modes of action for antidepressants. we have investigated
the effects of  xxxd2307xxx  and hyperoside, compounds with potentially antidepressant activity from st.
john’s wort, on the binding behavior and dynamics of beta2-ar in living rat c6 glioblastoma cells, compared
to desipramine (desmethylimipramine; dmi) by means of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (fcs)
and fluorescence microscopy. fcs-binding studies with the fluorescently labeled ligand alexa532noradrenaline (alexa532-na) binding to beta2-ar of c6 cells showed a significant reduction in total beta2-ar
binding after preincubation with  xxxd2307xxx  and hyperoside for 3 days, respectively, which was also found
for dmi. this was mainly observed in high-affinity receptor-ligand complexes with hindered lateral
mobility (d2 ) 1.1 ((0.4) µm2/s) in the biomembrane. however, internalization of beta2-ar was found
neither in z-scans of these c6 cells nor in hek 293 cells stably transfected with gfp-tagged beta2-adrenergic
receptors ( xxxg92xxx -gfp) after incubation up to 6 days with either dmi,  xxxd2307xxx , or hyperoside. thus,
under these conditions reduction of beta2-ar binding was not mediated by receptor internalization.
additionally, preincubation of c6 cells with dmi,  xxxd2307xxx , and hyperoside led to a loss of second
messenger camp after beta2-adrenergic stimulating conditions with terbutaline. our current results indicate
that  xxxd2307xxx  and hyperoside from st. john’s wort, as well as dmi, reduce beta2-adrenergic sensitivity in
c6 cells, emphazising the potential usefulness of st. john’s wort dry extracts in clinical treatment of
depressive symptoms.

depressive disorders are some of the most common mental
diseases, affecting approximately 20% of the population (1).
therapy is centered on the use of tricyclic antidepressants
(tca), selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (ssri), and
serotonin-noradrenaline-reuptake inhibitors (snri) together
with preparations from st. john’s wort (hypericum perforatum l.) for the treatment of mild to moderate cases (24). the pharmacological mode of action of both synthetic
antidepressants and st. john’s wort preparations relies on
noradrenaline (na) and serotonin (5-ht) neurotransmitter
metabolism. most antidepressants interfere with synaptic
communication by elevating neurotransmitter concentrations
in the synaptic cleft following inhibition of reuptake. this
results in a delayed adaptive alteration in neurotransmitter
receptor density in certain brain areas (2). for beta-adrenergic
receptors (beta-ar1) down-regulation is observed which can
be correlated temporally with clinical antidepressant effects

(5, 6).  xxxd2307xxx  is seen as one of the most important single
active compounds responsible for the pharmacological activity of st. john’s wort dry extracts. among others it inhibits
the synaptic reuptake of 5-ht and na (7, 8). flavonoids
are also of therapeutic relevance. hyperoside and its main
metabolite miquelianine, e.g., showed antidepressant effects
in the porsolt forced-swimming test (fst) in rats (9).
hyperoside and other glycosylated quercetin-flavonoids
influenced the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis (hpaaxis) in animals (10).
using desipramine (desmethylimipramine; dmi) as a
control, we investigated the influence of  xxxd2307xxx  and
hyperoside from st. john’s wort on beta2-ar of rat c6
glioblastoma cells, without any previous activation from
presynaptic neurons. this model has already been successfully applied to studies on signal transduction and downregulation of total beta-ar. therein, dmi influenced the
interaction of gs-proteins with effector proteins like adenylyl
cyclase (ac) (11), leading to a densensitization of beta-ar (12).
postsynaptic down-regulation of beta-ar in c6 cells after dmi
treatment has also been reported (13, 14). changes in beta-ar
dynamics are therefore to be expected in this model, similar
to those reported previously for beta2-ar on a549 cells and
hippocampal neurons under low stimulating conditions (15).

reduction of beta2-adrenergic receptor binding
state has also been demonstrated for the gabaa-receptor
(16). the effect of  xxxd2307xxx , hyperoside, and dmi on the
lateral mobility of beta2-ar after binding of a fluorescently
labeled noradrenaline derivative (alexa532-na) was investigated in c6 cells using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (fcs). fcs is a powerful method allowing measurements of particle dynamics on subcellular compartments
within living cells under real time conditions (17, 18). fcs
is therefore well suited for the observation of receptor-ligand
interactions, using receptor fusion proteins or fluorescently
labeled ligands (19). due to its noninvasive qualities, fcs
allows insights into the physiological regulatory mechanisms
for membrane receptors at the single molecular level (20,
21).
furthermore, effects of dmi,  xxxd2307xxx , and hyperoside
on the distribution of beta2-ar-gfp fusion proteins in stably
transfected hek 293 cells have been investigated.
experimental procedures
materials. desipramine-hcl was purchased from icn
biomedicals.  xxxd2307xxx  was obtained from hwi-analytics.
hyperoside was obtained from roth chemicals. all reagents
for cell culture were from gibco brl.  xxxd2398xxx -sulfate
and terbutaline-hemisulfate were purchased from sigma. all
other reagents were obtained from merck or sigma and of
the highest purity available.
fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. fcs measurements were performed with a confocor instrument (zeiss)
equipped with an argon laser lgk 7812 ml 2 (lasos) and
a water immersion objective c-apochromat, 63×, na 1.2
(zeiss). size of the illuminated volume element was 0.19
fl. for excitation the 514 nm line was used. power density
in the focal plane, measured before the objective, was p514 nm
) 14.2-109 kw/cm2. the emitted fluorescence was separated from the excitation light with a dichroic filter and a
bandpass filter; wavelength splitting at 514 nm: ft 540,
ef 530-600 (zeiss). the fluorescence intensity fluctuations
were detected by an avalanche single photon counting
module spcm-aq series (eg & g optoelectonics). the
signal was correlated online to data acquisition with a digital
hardware correlator alv-5000 (alv). prior to experiments,
the volume element of observation was calibrated. for this
purpose, autocorrelation functions for the dye diffusion of
10 nm tetramethylrhodamine (tmr) (invitrogen) in binding
buffer were recorded. the radii omega0 ) 0.19 µm and z0 )
1.08 µm were calculated (according to eqs 1 and 3) from
the determined diffusion time constant for tmr and a
diffusion coefficient of 280 µm2/s (22). laser cell scans were
performed by moving the focus in the z-direction through
the cell to characterize the initial autofluorescence and the
fluorescence intensity after ligand incubation in c6 cells.
cells which showed a typical 2-peak profile, with the cytosol
representing an area of low fluorescence, were chosen for
fcs measurements if the magnitude of fluorescence did not
exceed certain boundaries. for the ligand binding studies,
taking the position of the half-maximal autofluorescence of
the upper membrane, the focus took in fast diffusing free
ligand and slow diffusing receptor-ligand complexes.
single particle tracking. trajectories of single receptorligand complexes were measured with a te2000 mikroscope
(nikon) equipped with a cfl objective plan apo vc 60x

wi, a glk 3250 t01 continuous-wave diode-pumped solidstate laser (lasos), and a ixon dv 860 bi camera (andor
technologies) used in combination with a 4-fold magnifier.
laser power was 2 mw. for excitation a 532 nm line with
an intensity of 1.87 kw/cm2 was used. exposure time was
10 ms with a kinetic cycling time of 10.22 ms. alexa532na concentration was 1 nm.
fluorescence microscopy. fluorescence microscopy was
performed with a fluorescent microscope axiovert 100m,
oil immersion objective plan neofluar 100×, na 1.3;
camera, axiocam hrm; lamp, hbo 50; software, axiovision
3.1 (zeiss).
pictures shown are representative of 3 independently
performed experiments.
data analysis. data from fcs calibration measurements
with free dye in solution and from fluorescently labeled
ligand in solution, respectively, were calculated with the

results
beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-ar) binding studies on c6 cells
were performed using fcs and a fluorescently labeled
noradrenaline (alexa532-na). alexa532-na binds selectively to beta2-ar (15) and mediated a dose-dependent increase
in intracellular camp formation. after incubation of c6 cells
with 0.5 µm and 1 µm of alexa532-na, respectively, camp
levels increased by 27.1 ((1.1)% and 55.2 ((10.6)%
(n ) 3) (figure 1). c6 cells incubated with 10 nm alexa532na for 15 min showed a total binding of 4.26 ((0.53) nm

of receptor-ligand complexes was not found in laser-aided
c6 cell z-scans, whereas stronger stimulation of cells with 1
µm terbutaline led to internalization of receptor-ligand
complexes (figure 2). analysis of the binding data revealed
a diffusion time constant of taufree ) 39.9 ((2.3) µs and a

in c6 cells when pretreated for 3 days with 1 µm of dmi,
 xxxd2307xxx , and hyperoside, respectively. control cells
revealed an increased chemiluminescence signal of 107 rlu
(relative light units) for 6.33 pmol camp/25 000 cells after
stimulation with 10 µm of terbutaline for 30 min compared
to the basal values. under the same conditions, pretreated
cells showed a significant decrease in chemiluminescence
of 47.4 ((26.3)% for dmi, 61.1 ((10.8)% for  xxxd2307xxx ,
and 61.9 ((28.8)% for hyperoside (figure 6) compared to
control cells. for internalization studies hek293 cells stably
expressing a beta2-ar-gfp fusion protein (hek293beta2argfp) were treated up to 6 days with 1 µm of dmi,
 xxxd2307xxx , and hyperoside, respectively. in contrast to
control cells stimulated with 10 µm  xxxd2401xxx  for 30 min
(figure 7b) exclusive treatment with dmi,  xxxd2307xxx , and
hyperoside, respectively, led to no internalization of beta2argfp in these cells (figure 7c,d,e).

hyperoside, respectively, for 3 days decreased the alexa532na binding significantly, compared to control cells
(figure 3b-d, table 1). for treated cells similar diffusion
time constants and diffusion coefficients, respectively, were
found for the two different receptor-ligand states (table 1).
in untreated control cells the alexa532-na binding was
distributed between the taudiff1 and taudiff2 fractions with a ratio
of 1.9. due to the fact that the reduction of beta2-ar binding
in treated cells mainly correlated with a decrease in the taudiff2
fraction, taudiff1/taudiff2 ratios increased to 5.3 for dmi, 3.4 for
 xxxd2307xxx , and 4.0 for hyperoside (table 1). decreased  xxxg92xxx  binding resulted in reduced intracellular camp formation

antidepressants mainly interfere with central neurotransmitter signaling, e.g., inhibition of either neurotransmitter
reuptake or monoamine oxidase activity, followed by adaptive changes in the density of serotonin and beta-adrenergic
receptor (beta-ar) subtypes. synthetic selective serotoninreuptake inhibitors (ssri), serotonin-noradrenaline-reuptake
inhibitors (snri), and tricyclic antidepressants (tca), as
well as st. john’s wort dry extracts are used for the treatment
of depressive disorders. to further investigate the influence
of  xxxd2307xxx  and hyperoside, major components of st. john’s
wort dry extracts, on membrane associated receptors, we
determined the binding behavior and lateral mobility of
ligand activated beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta2-ar) after subchronic treatment of rat c6 glioblastoma cells, in comparison
to desipramine (dmi).
c6 cells serve as an approved model for the investigation
of regulatory processes at the single cellular level without
any presynaptic input from neurotransmitters (13, 25, 26).
binding studies for the beta2-ar were performed using
fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (fcs) and a fluorescently labeled noradrenaline derivative (alexa532-na) in
c6 cells expressing the beta2-ar at low density on the cell
surface (27, 28). the beta2-selective binding behavior of
alexa532-na has been described previously (15). a dosedependent increase of intracellular camp level was found
after incubation of c6 cells with alexa532-na and beta2-ar
binding which clearly indicated the functionality of the ligand
(figure 1). incubation of c6 cells with 10 nm alexa532na resulted in a total binding of 4.26 ((0.53) nm. two
different diffusion time constants for the receptor-ligand
complex were obtained with a fraction ratio taudiff 1/taudiff 2 of
1.9 (figure 3a, table 1). from the diffusion time constants
taudiff 1 and taudiff 2, diffusion coefficients of d1 ) 15.4 ((8.5)
µm2/s and d2 ) 1.1 ((0.4) µm2/s were calculated. photobleaching of bound alexa532-na was investigated by
measuring trajectories of single beta2-ar-alexa532-na complexes on the biomembrane of c6 cells. a typical trajectory
of 34 frames over 347 ms and a spatial extent of approximately 0.5 × 1.6 µm2 is given in figure 4a. the
evaluation of the brightness of each spot clearly demonstrated
the photostability of alexa532-na, although minor blinking
effects were found in the fluorescence intensity (figure 4b).
thus, the different diffusion time constants for bound

alexa532-na molecules were not caused by photobleaching

(a549) with taudiff 1 ) 1.8 and 3.3 ms, and taudiff 2 ) 158.6 and

these cells the fraction of hindered, i.e., slower lateral
receptor mobility was clearly increased during internalization
processes. similar results were found for the gabaa and
the benzodiazepine receptor (16, 21). thus, differences in
taudiff2 may result from the different cell types and their
different internalization behavior after beta2-ar stimulation with
alexa532-na in nanomolar concentrations. comparison of
beta2-ar down-regulation to internalization in beas-2b cells
showed that weak agonist stimulation caused down-regulation in the absence of significant internalization (28). to
detect internalized receptor-ligand complexes, c6 cells
stimulated with 10 nm alexa532-na were scanned by
moving a sharply focused laser beam along the z-direction.
individual fluorescent events correlating with the appearance
of receptor-ligand complexes in the cytoplasm were not
found in contrast to c6 cells which were stimulated with
10 nm alexa532-na together with 1 µm of terbutaline
(figure 2). under the same conditions z-scans with intensive
events in the fluorescence track indicating internalized  xxxg92xxx  have been published for a549 cells (15). from saturation
binding experiments low and high affinity states of receptorligand complexes were found with dissociation constants of
kd1 ) 3.97 ((1.26) nm and kd2 ) 0.63 ((0.66) nm which
correlated with the mobility fractions taudiff 1 and taudiff 2,
respectively. preincubation of c6 cells with dmi led to a

reduction in total alexa532-na binding of 38.0% mainly
caused by a decrease in the high-affinity receptor-ligand
fraction with taudiff 2 (table 1, figure 3b). whereas values
for taudiff 1 and taudiff 2 stayed almost unchanged, the fraction
ratio taudiff 1/taudiff 2 changed significantly from 1.9 to 5.3
(table 1). a decrease in total beta-ar density after dmi
treatment has also been shown in c6 cells in radioreceptor
assay experiments (27). interestingly, hek293 cells overexpressing beta2-ar as a gfp-fusion construct showed no
receptor internalization after dmi treatment. our findings
lead us to the conclusion that reduction in total alexa532na binding is due to a decrease in the formation of the
receptor-ligand complex with taudiff 2 in the high affinity state
which was described before as the high conformational
receptor state resulting from the temporary ligand-receptorgs-protein trimer (30). one possible explanation could be
changes in the interaction of occupied receptors with
regulatory proteins like gs-protein after dmi treatment,
already reported for neutrophile beta2-ar after treatment of
panic disorder (pd) patients with the structurally related
imipramine (31). alterations in the interaction of gs-protein
and beta-ar, with resulting changes in the ratio of high and
low conformational receptor states, have also been demonstrated after preincubation of c6 cells with dmi (12, 13,
32). in our experiments similar results have been obtained
with c6 cells preincubated with  xxxd2307xxx  and hyperoside,
respectively. a decrease in total alexa-na binding of 46.9%
for  xxxd2307xxx  and 40.6% for hyperoside was observed,
characterized by a shift of the corresponding autocorrelation
curves on the fcs time scale (table 1, figure 3c,d). despite
gfp-tagged beta2-ar’s showing no internalization in the
presence of  xxxd2307xxx  and hyperoside in our experiments,
a decrease in beta-ar density in rats after treatment for 2 weeks
with a  xxxd2307xxx -rich st. john’s wort extract has been
reported, although this study did not differentiate between
receptor subtypes (7). dmi-like results were found for the
fraction ratio taudiff 1/taudiff 2, which was 3.4 for  xxxd2307xxx  and
4.0 for hyperoside, caused by a significant decrease in the
number of high affinity beta2-ar-ligand complexes with taudiff
2. the resulting reduction in beta2-adrenergic sensitivity of c6
cells under the influence of dmi,  xxxd2307xxx , and hyperoside,
respectively, was demonstrated by a reduction of intracellular
camp concentration after stimulation with terbutaline
(figure 6). for dmi such an influence on beta-ar and
downstream camp production in c6 cells has already been
reported using radioreceptor assay (12, 13, 27). for  xxxd2307xxx  and hyperoside, however, a reduced responsiveness of
the beta2-adrenergic stimulated ac/camp signaling pathway
is, to our knowledge, reported here for the first time.

john’s wort in in vitro and animal models have been
described previously (7, 9, 10, 33). the mode of action of
synthetic antidepressants, as well as of st. john’s wort, is
basically attributed to synaptic communication of the neurotransmitters noradrenaline and serotonin. effects of single
compounds from st. john’s wort on the postsynaptic
regulation of beta2-ar have not yet been described. a more
detailed view on such effects concerning receptor subtypes
is of interest because it has been shown that the ratio of the
 xxxg836xxx -/beta2-ar distribution in cells influences ac activity differently (34, 35). our work presents data on the reduction
in beta2-adrenergic sensitivity of c6 cells with the isolated
compounds  xxxd2307xxx  and hyperoside. it therefore provides
an insight into the mode of action and the therapeutic
relevance of st. john’s wort preparations for the treatment
of mild to moderate depression and anxiety symptoms.
