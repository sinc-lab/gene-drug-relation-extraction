s t elevation in brugada syndrome. introduction: brugada syndrome is characterized by an
st segment elevation in leads v,-v, and a high incidence of ventricular fihrillation (vf). a mutation
in a cardiac na^ channel gene.,  xxxg2028xxx . has been linked to brugada syndrome, and sodium channel
hlockers have been shown to be effective in unmasking the syndrome when concealed. the aim of
this study was to examine the effects of na"^ channel blockers on st segment elevation, qrs,
corrected qt (qtc) interval, and ventricular arrhythmias in patients with brugada syndrome.
methods and results: we examined the effects of three different na^ channel hlockers ( xxxd2113xxx ,
disopyramide, and  xxxd2635xxx ) on the amplitude of the st segment 20 msec after the end of qrs
(st20), qrs duration, qtc interval measured from 12-lead ecg, and ventricular arrhythmias in
12 brugada and 10 control patients. maximum st20 observed in the v, or v, leads under baseline
conditions was greater in the brugada patients than in control patients, whereas qrs duration and
maximum qtc interval were no different hetween the two groups.  xxxd2113xxx  and disopyramide, hut
not  xxxd2635xxx , significantly increased maximum st20 and qrs duration in both groups, although
these effects were much more pronounced in the brugada patients. the increases in st20 and qrs
duration with  xxxd2113xxx  were significantly larger than those with disopyramide. .\n increase of 0.15
mv in st20 with  xxxd2113xxx  separated the two groups without overlap. ventricular premature
complexes developed only with  xxxd2113xxx  in brugada patients (3/12) displaying a marked st
elevation but not widening of qrs.
conclusion: our findings suggest that na"^ channel blockers amplify existing ij^.^ and possibly
other ion channel defects, with a potency inversely proportional to the rate of dissociation of the drug
from the na"^ channel, thus causing a prominent elevation of the st segment and, in some cases,
prolongation of qrs duration in patients with brugada .syndrome. (j cardiovasc electrophy.siol. vol.

their strong effect to block na^ channels.'^" moreover,
recent genetic studies identified the first gene mutation
linked to the brugada syndrome on  xxxg2028xxx . the gene that
enctxles for tbe  xxxg220xxx  of the na^ channel.''* however, it is still unclear how na * channel blockers interact
with these and other brugada mutations to cause or
accentuiite st segment elevation and vf in brugada
patients. the present study was designed to examine the
effects of three different na^ channel blockers ( xxxd2113xxx . disopyramide, and  xxxd2635xxx ) displaying different
levels of use-dependent soiiiutii channel binck on st
segment etevatiim. qrs duration, corrected qt (qtc)
interval, and ventricular arrhythmias in patients with
biugada syndrome.
methods
study population
the present study used a patient-control design. tbe
patient group consisted of 12 consecutive patients with
brugada syndrome who were admitted to the national
cardiovascular center. suita. japan, between 1998 and
2()(k). none of the brugadu patients were related to each
other. brugada syndrome was diagnosed if the following
criteria were fulhlled: (1) history of cardiac arrest or
aborted sudden cardiac death with or witbout docutnentation of vf; (2) persistent or transient st segment
elevation (coved or saddleback type) in the right precordial leads (v|-v,) with or without some degree of
rbbb: (3) qtc interval <440 msec"': (4) normal hndings on physical examination: and (5) no evidence of
structural heart diseases demonstrated by cardiac echocardiogram. coronary angiogram, right and left ventriciilogram, and radionucteogram. clinical, bcg. and elcctrophysidlogic characteristics of ihe 12 brugada patients
are shown in table 1. .all patients were males, ranging in
age from 27 to 63 years (tnean 46 i^ 10). it often was

difficuh to define incomplete or complete rbbb in brugada patients, because st segment elevation in the right
precordial leads mimicked pseudo-rbbb. thus, we defined rbbb when the patient had a widened s wave in
the left precordial lead (v,,) and qrs duration ^i(x)
msec: incomplete rbbb was defined if qrs duration
<i2o msec, cnmplete rbbb if qrs duration >i2o
msec. during electrophysinlogic study. hv interval was
prolonged (^50 msec) in 5 of the 12 patients. vf that
required direct cardioversion to be terminated or nonsustained polymoqihic ventricular tachycardia was induced
by up to triple extrastimuli in all but one patient.
the control group consisted of k) age- and sexmatched subjects: all were males ranging in age from 30
to 66 years (mean 44 ± 10). they included 5 normal
subjects with normal qrs duration (< l()0 msec), 3 with
incomplete rbbb (100 msec < qrs duration < 120
msec), and 2 with cotnplete rbbb (120 msec < qrs
duration) but without structural heart diseases or any
ventricular arrhythmias.
twelve-lead ecg acquisition atui data .analysis
all protocols were reviewed atid appro\ed by our
hthical review committee, and informed consent was
obtained from all patients. all antiarrhythmic medications were discontinued for at least five drug half-lives.
after at least > minutes of bed rest. fcg data acquisition
(fukuda dcnshi fdx-6521. tokyo. japan) was performed during sinus rbythm in the supine rest state in a
quiet room. a standard 12-lead fcg was monitored
continuously from ^ minutes before the administration
of the drugs until 30 minutes after the completion of
drugs. fcg outputs of eight leads (1, li, and v, through
v(,) were simultancinisly stored on a computer hard
di.sk using 12-bit analog-to-digital converters (contec
ad 12-8, japan) at i khz per lead. subsequent off-line

analysis was performed at a speed of 1.000 mm/sec with
custom-developed ititt:rai;ti\c software on a dell dirnensioti 40{)c personal computer. we first determined the
be:it-by-beat rr inter\'al by tieteeting tbe peak of the r
wave in lead v^. ecg data iroin four leads (hi. avr.
avl. and avf) were mathematically derived tiom the
data of leads i and ii. similarly prtxessed in the standard
12-lead ecg recording system. to obtain a satisfactorv
signal-to-noise ratio, the qrs-t complex in each lend
was averaged over live heats. beeause accurate estimation of qrs duration was difficult in the righl precordial
leads (v|-vi) in brtigada patients, we incorporated the
information from nine leads, exeludinj: v|-v, leads in a
single complex. that is. we algebraically summed the
absolute deflections of ecg voltage (relative to the isoelectric line) over nine leads. qrs duration was defined
as the interval between qrs onset and the point at which
the summed qrs approached the isoelectrie line. amplitude of the st segment 20 msec after the end of qrs
(st20) was measured iiutomatically from all 12-lead
ecgs, and the maximum st20 in a single lead was
obtained among the 12 leads. qt interval was defined as
the time interval between the qrs onset, delineil as the
earliest deflection of 12 qrs complexes, and the point at
which the isoelectric line intersected a tangential line
drawn at the maximal downslope of the positi\e t wa\e
or at the maximal upslope of ihe negative t wave. qt
interval was meastired automatically from all 12-lead
ecgs, corrected by ba/.ett's method (qtc = q t / v r r ) .
and the maximum qtc interval was obtained among the
12 leads.

drug administration and serum
drug concentrations
the effects of three different na^ channel hloekers.
llecainide (class ic. 2 mg/kg). disopyramide (class la,
2 mg/kg), and  xxxd2635xxx  (class ib, 2 mg/kg), were
examined in random order at intervals of 1 or 2 days.
after recording a 12-lead ecg under baseline conditions, each drug was intravenously infused for 10 minutes, and drug data usually were eulleeted 5 minutes after
the completion of the drugs, when the effect of the drug
reached steady state. the appearance of ventricular arrhythmias was monitored continuously from 5 minutes
before the administration of the drugs until 30 minutes
after the completion of drugs. serum samples were oblained lo monitor drug concentrations immediately after
recording drug data in 7 brugada patients iwn] in ?
control patients.
statistics
data are given as mean ± sd. repeated-measures
analysis of variance (anova) followed b) seheffe s
test were used to compare (1) measurements made tiiidcr
baseline conditions and after eaeh drug administration;
and (2) differences before and after eaeh drtig administration between the three drugs. the student's rtesi for
unpaired data was used to compiu'e differences between

bnigada and control patients, and between brugada palients with and without induced ventricular airhythmias.
p < 0.0.*i was considered statistically significant.

results
rr interval
changes in mean rr intervals are shown in figure
la. under baseline conditions (predrug). mean rr interval values were similar for brugada and control patients during each session, as well as among the three
sessions. disopyramide significantly deerea.sed mean rr
intervals in both patient groups, and fiecainide did so as
well but only in control patients, probably due to their
antieholinergic eftects.  xxxd2635xxx  did not significantly
change mean rr intervals in either group.
qrs ihiration
changes in mean qrs duration are shown in figure
ib. under baseline conditions. 6 brugada patients exhibited normal qrs durations. 4 patienis showed incomplete rbbb. and 2 patients had complete rbbb. mean
qrs duratit>n values were no different between brugada
and control patients at each session, as well as among
three sessions. both llecainide and disopyramide. but not
 xxxd2635xxx . significantly increased mean qrs durations.
the increases with fiecainide were significantly larger
ihan those with di.sopyramide in both patient groups
(figs. ib. 2. 3. 4. and 3a), although these effects were
much greater in brugada patients than in control patients
(figs. ib and .sa). widening of qrs duration in the 12
brugada patients varied in response to  xxxd2113xxx  and did
not differentiate brugada patients from control patients
(fig. 5a). it is noteworthy that the increases in qrs
duration with llecainide were significantly larger in the 6
brugada patients with complete and incomplete rbbb
than the remaining 6 brugada patients with normal qrs
duration (37 ± 8 msec vs 27 ± 4 msec; p < 0.05) (figs.
2b and 3b).
maximum st amplittide
changes in mean maximum st20 values are shown in
figure ic. maximum .st20 was recorded in v-, (ii
brugada patietits and 6 control patients) and vi (1 brugada patient and 4 control patients) leads. the location of
the maximum st20 was no different before and after
drug in either patient group. mean predrug maximum
st20 values were similar among the three sessions in
each grt>up. mean predrug maximiun st2() was significantly greater in brugada patients than in control patients
(figs. ic, 2a. 3a. and 4a). both tlecainide and disopyramide, but not  xxxd2635xxx . significantly increased
mean maximtim st20. increases with llecainide were
signifieantly larger than those with disopyramide in both
patient groups (figs. ic, 2, 3, 4 and 5b). increases with
 xxxd2113xxx  and disopyramide were much greater in brugada patients than in coiilrol patients (figs. ic and .sb),

ventricular premature complexes (vpcs) and couplets developed only in response to  xxxd2113xxx  in 3 of 12

neither vf nor polymorphic ventricular tachycardia was
observed. vpcs and couplets appeared as maximum st
segment elevation reached a peak, and the morphology
of the vpcs showed a left bundle branch block pattern
with normal axis, suggesting that the vpcs originated
near the right ventricular outflow tract in the 3 brugada

discussion

differential respotises to sodium channel blockers
and the underlying mechanism of st
segment elevation
chen et ai.'** recently reported the first gene mutation
linked lo the brugada syndrome in  xxxg2028xxx . which encodes tor ihe cardiac nu* channel gene. delects in the
gene caused either an acceleration of reactivation of the
na^ channel (ti620m missense mutation) or nonfunctional na^ channels (frame shift mutation). a more recent report by dumaine et al..-" in which t1620m mutation occurred ai more physiologic temperatures,
indicates an important acceleration of inactivalion of the
fast sodium current (i^^,). with hoth types of mutations.
ifvjy available during phase 1 of the action polential (ap)
is sharply reduced. several experimental studies suggested that a transient outward current (i,,,)-mediated
phase 1 notch of the ap is more prominent in the
epicardium than in the endocardium of the ventricles of

many species.-'-^" including humans.^''•-^ because maintenance of the ap dome is determined by the balance of
currents active at the end of phase i of the ap [principally i,^, and ca-"^ current (itjl. any agents that cause an
outward shift in current active at the end of phase i (e.g.,
t 1,,,. 1 ic,,- and i inj can increase the magnitude of the
ap notch and lead to loss of the ap dome in the epicardium but not the endocardium. this can give rise to large
transmural voltage gradients soon after ventricular activation that are thought to underlie the st segment elevation, similar to that found in brugada patients.'"" yan
and antzelevitch" used arlerially perfu.sed canine right
ventricular wedge preparations to develop an experimental model of the brugada syndrome. the authors suggested that an na' channel blocker.  xxxd2113xxx . facilitates
loss of the dome as a result of a negative shift in the
voltage at which phase i begins, causing phase 1 to end
at a more negative potential where i^;, may be less
available, resulting in the development of an st segment
elevation. ^"-^^

figure 3. flevainide-induced marked st segment elevation and ventricular premature complexes ivpcs) in a patient with brugada syndrome.
coved and saddlehack-t\pe st segment elevation (0.35 tnv) was seen in lends v'j anil v.. and qrs duration was normal (96 msec) under baseline
conditions (a. arrow).  xxxd2113xxx  induced eoiiplets following marked st segment elevation (1.18 mv) without ii major increase in qrs duration
(112 msec) (b, arrow). the vpcs displayed a left bundle branch block pattern with normal axis, suggesting a right ventricular outflow tract

origin.

in the present study, strong use-dependent block of
fast 1^,, with llecainide produced the most pronounced
st segment elevation in both control patients and brugada patients. this characteristic of the drug is due to its
slow dissociation from sodium channels. disopyramide.
which exhibits less use-dependent block of i^., due to
faster dissociation of the drug tor the sodium channel,
showed a weaker st segment elevation than ilecainide.
the weaker accentuation of st segment elevation produced by disopyramide i.s likely due to its smaller effect
on 1-^,, and possibly to its modest action to block 1,,, (ic5,,
in rabbit ventricle - 4.8 fxglml. mean serum concentration of disopyramide obtained from the seven brugada
patients = 3.8 ± 1.3 (xg/ml).^-'  xxxd2113xxx  also blocks
it,,, but its ic_^,, is much higher (1,200 ng/ml in human
ventricle) than the mean serum concentration of  xxxd2113xxx  obtained from the seven brugada patients (293 ± 85
ng/ml).-" although  xxxd2113xxx  also signiticantly increased st segment elevation more than disopyramide in
control patients, the response to the drugs clearly was
more marked in the brugada patients, indicating that

balance of currents contributing to the ap notch at the
end of phase 1 is more easily perturbed by na"^ channel
block in the brugada syndrome. this probably is due to
intrinsically stronger net outward current at the end of
phase i in brugada patients than in control patients.
 xxxd2635xxx  dissociates from the sodium channel rapidly
and therefore blocks l^._^, principally at rapid rates. at
moderate and slow heart rates,  xxxd2635xxx  has little or no
effect on fast 1^,,,. which explains its inability to cause st
segment elevation in either group. our data support the
hypothesis that the 1,,,-mediated notch at the end of phase
1 of the epicardial ap plays a significant role in the
phenotypic manifestation of st segment elevation in
brugada syndrome. moreover, our data that an increase
of 0.15 mv in st segment elevation with  xxxd2113xxx 
could discriminate brugada patients from control patients without overlap provide further indication that
fiecainide. a class ic antiarrhythmic. is more useful than
other agents for unmasking and diagnosing the brugada
syndrome.

differential responses of qrs duration
to sodium channel blockers
among the mutations in  xxxg2028xxx  uncovered by chen
et al.''^ in brugada syndrome, the frame shift mutation is
likely to result in a decrea.sc in the number of functional
na^ channels. dumaine et al.-" observed a 10-mv positive shift of steady-state activation in t162()m mutant
na^ channels, which would he expected to raise the
activation threshold, thus resulting in a mild conduction
delay. these findings may explain the mild-to-moderate
conduction abnormalities evident in some brugada patients. conduction abnormalities, such as rbbb, prolonged hv intervals, or localized conduction delay at the
right ventricular outflow tract, have been descrihed in
patients with brugada syndrome.'-'" i-'
six of the brugada patients in this study exhibited
prolonged qrs durations (>ioo msec), due at least in
part to complete rbbb (two patients) or incomplete
rbbb (tour patients). moreover. hv interval was prolonged (>50 msec) in 5 of the 6 brugada patients with

qrs prolongation (table 1). widening of the qrs duration by  xxxd2113xxx  in the six brugada patients with qrs
prolongation was greater than that in the brugada patients with normal qrs duration. our findings suggest
that strong na^ channel pharmacologic blockade amplifies existing i^^ deficiencies or other ion channel dysfunctions, thus producing more prominent elevation of
the st .segment as well as a greater increase in qrs
duration. the genetic heterogeneity of the syndrome has
long been appreciated: our data raise the possibility that
a greater qrs widening in response to na^ channel
blockers may help to distinguish brugada patients with
the na^ channel defect from those afflicted with other
gene mutations. a test of this hypothesis awaits the
genotyping of our brugada patients.
of note, drug-induced changes in qrs duration were
much smaller, but proportional, in control patients. these
findings most likely reflect the normal action of na"^
channel blockers on right ventricular epicardial aps.''2-33

possible mechanism of ventricular arrhythmias
yan and antzelevitch" used petfused wedge preparations to study the cellular basis for the brugada syndrome. their data suggested that heterogeneous loss of
ap dome in the epicardium results in marked dispersion
of repolari/ation, giving rise to u premature beat, due to
phase 2 reentry, which precipitates vf. loss of the ap
dome at some epicardial sites but not others creates
rnarked dispersion of repolari/.ation within epicardium as
well as transtnural dispetsion of repolarization. providing
further substrate for the developtnent of vf.
in the present study,  xxxd2113xxx  induced vpcs atid
couplets in three bnigada patients. this extrasystolic
activity appeared to originate in the right ventricular
outflow tract following a prominent  xxxd2113xxx -induced
st segment elevation, without a significant widening of
the qrs duration. these observations suggest a close
relationship between extrasystolic activity and prominent
st segment elevation, and they support the hypothesis of
phase 2 reentry as ihe basis for the extrasystole that
triggers vf.

differential responses of qtc interval to sodium
channel blockers
qtc inten'al has been reported to be within a normal
range in most patients with the brugada syndrome.'^ •' it
is noteworthy ihal olher mutations in  xxxg2028xxx  capable of
increasing the intensity of late i^^ can cause ihe  xxxg2028xxx 
form of long qt syndrome.-^^-^^ a recent report by bezzina et al.'** indicates ihat some  xxxg2028xxx  mutations lead to
the development of both brugada and long qt phenotypes. in tbe present study, mean qtc interval under
baseline conditions was <44{) msec"" in bmgada patient-s. disopyramide. which has a strong effect on blocking the rapidly activating component of the delayed
rectifier potassium current l^r (ic^n in rabbit ventricle =
0.6 /i-g/ml: tnean serutn concentration of disopyramide
obtained from tbe seven brugada patients = 3.8 ± 1.3

than  xxxd2113xxx , which does not block 1^;^ as much, ln
contrast,  xxxd2635xxx  slightly, but significantly, abbreviated tbe qtc inlervai. probably due to its effect on
blocking iate inu-^**
limitations of the study
none of the 12 brugada patients in the present study

mutation, even though their dna samples are screened.
a recent elegant study by brugada et al.'^ demonsirated
that intravenous injection of  xxxd96xxx , procainamide. or
 xxxd2113xxx  resulted in st segment elevation and rbbb in
34 brugada patienis and 11 fiimily members in whom an
 xxxg2028xxx  mulation was associated with the syntlrome, but
not in 8 family members in whom it was not. so far. only
several families with brugada syndrome have heen genotyped as an  xxxg2028xxx  mutation, whereas most of brugada
patients (>90'^) cannot be genotyped. even among the
 xxxg2028xxx  mutations, genetic hetertigeneity exists (t1620
missense mutation or frame shift mutation). therefore,
we believe thai the data in our brugada patients provide
further support for ihe genelic heierogenciiy of brugada
syndrome, even if there have heen no genetic data from
our patients.
