 xxxg828xxx  activation promotes seizure activity in the juvenile rat
hippocampus. j. neurophysiol. 82: 638 – 647, 1999. we analyzed how
the  xxxg828xxx  agonist baclofen (10 –50 mm) influences the activity induced by  xxxd1804xxx  ( xxxd1804xxx , 50 mm) in the ca3 area of
hippocampal slices obtained from 12- to 25-day-old rats. interictal and
ictal discharges along with synchronous gaba-mediated potentials occurred spontaneously in the presence of  xxxd1804xxx . baclofen abolished interictal activity (n 5 29 slices) and either disclosed (n 5 21/29) or prolonged ictal discharges (n 5 8/29), whereas gaba-mediated potentials
occurred at a decreased rate. the n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor
antagonist 3,3-(2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphate (cpp, 10
mm, n 5 8) did not modify the gaba-mediated potentials or the ictal
events recorded in  xxxd1804xxx  1 baclofen. in contrast ictal, activity, but not
gaba-mediated potentials, was blocked by the non-nmda receptor
antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (cnqx, 10 mm, n 5
5). most baclofen effects were reversed by the  xxxg828xxx  antagonist cgp 35348 (1 mm; n 5 4). baseline and transient increases in
[k1]o associated with the  xxxd1804xxx –induced synchronous activity were unaffected by baclofen. baclofen hyperpolarized ca3 pyramids (n 5 8)
recorded with k-acetate–filled electrodes by 4.8 6 1.3 mv and made
spontaneous, asynchronous hyperpolarizing and depolarizing potentials
disappear along with interictal depolarizations. gaba-mediated synchronous long-lasting depolarizations (llds) and asynchronous depolarizations were also studied with kcl-filled electrodes in  xxxd1804xxx  1 cpp 1
cnqx (n 5 6); under these conditions baclofen did not reduce lld
amplitude but abolished the asynchronous events. dentate hilus stimulation at 0.2–0.8 hz suppressed the ictal activity recorded in  xxxd1804xxx  1
baclofen (n 5 8). our data indicate that  xxxg828xxx  activation by
baclofen decreases transmitter release leading to disappearance of interictal activity along with asynchronous excitatory and inhibitory potentials. by contrast, gaba-mediated llds and ictal events, which reflect
intense action potential firing invading presynaptic inhibitory and excitatory terminals respectively, are not abolished. we propose that the
proconvulsant action of baclofen results from 1) block of asynchronous
gaba-mediated potentials causing disinhibition and 2) activity-dependent changes in hippocampal network excitability.

long-axoned cells (bowery 1993; kaila 1994; macdonald and
olsen 1994; misgeld et al. 1995). epileptiform activity ensues
when gabaergic mechanisms weaken (krnjevic 1991), and
several anticonvulsant drugs including some of the newest
compounds, may enhance gabaa-mediated inhibition (olsen
and avoli 1997).
 xxxg828xxx –mediated mechanisms are involved in the
generation of focal seizures and in epileptogenesis (haas et al.
1996; mclean et al. 1996; scanziani et al. 1994; velı́sková et
al. 1996). however, the  xxxg828xxx  agonist baclofen may
possess a surprising proconvulsant effect as documented in
clinical practice (kofler et al. 1994; rush and gibberd 1990)
and in some models of epileptiform discharge (lewis et al.
1989; mott et al. 1989; swartzwelder et al. 1987; watts and
jefferys 1993). it has also been proposed that the proconvulsant effect of baclofen is caused by a presynaptic, gababmediated inhibition of gaba release from inhibitory interneurons leading to disinhibition (mott et al. 1989; watts and
jefferys 1993).
although age-related differences in the ability of baclofen to
modulate seizures have been described (velı́sková et al. 1996),
the evidence for a proconvulsant action of this  xxxg828xxx  agonist mainly derives from studies in the adult brain. here
we used extracellular and intracellular recording techniques in
conjunction with [k1]o measurements to characterize the effects of baclofen on the activity induced by the convulsant
 xxxd1804xxx  ( xxxd1804xxx ) in the ca3 area of hippocampal slices
obtained from young rats. at this age both interictal and ictal
discharges occur in vitro along with synchronous gabamediated events (avoli et al. 1993, 1996). some of these
findings have been published in abstract form (motalli et al.
1997; tancredi et al. 1998).

mm), 3,3-(2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphate (cpp, 10
mm), 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (cnqx, 10 mm), and
cgp-35348 (1 mm) were bath applied. chemicals were acquired from
sigma with the exception of cnqx and cpp (obtained from tocris
cookson) and cgp 35348 (kindly donated by novartis, basel).

recording procedures
extracellular field potential recordings were made in ca3 stratum
radiatum with electrodes filled with 2 m nacl or acsf (resistance,
2– 8 mv). intracellular recordings were performed with electrodes
filled with 2 m k-acetate (resistance, 70 –120 mv) or 3 m kcl
(resistance, 60 –90 mv). signals were fed to high-impedance amplifiers with internal bridge circuit for passing intracellular current. the
bridge was monitored carefully throughout the experiment and adjusted as required. whenever necessary the resting membrane potential (rmp) during any given pharmacological test was maintained at
the same value as in control by injecting intracellular current.

k1-selective electrodes were prepared according to the techniques
described by heinemann et al. (1977) and previously used in our
laboratories (avoli et al. 1996). for each ion-selective electrode, a
double-barreled pipette was pulled to a tip diameter of 1–2 mm and
silanized. one barrel was filled with nacl and was used as a reference
electrode. the other barrel was filled with a k1 solution, and the
k1-selective resin,  xxxd3484xxx -based k1 ionophore i (cocktail a),
was sucked into the tip. the resin was acquired from fluka chemical.
k1-selective electrodes were tested and calibrated before and after the
experiment in different solutions, which were as follows (in mm): 1)
146 nacl and 3 kcl; 2) 146 nacl and 30 kcl; 3) 119 nacl and 30
kcl; and 4) 59 nacl and 90 kcl. k1-selective electrodes were
accepted if their response to a 10-fold change in [k1] was $49 mv.
signals from the k1-selective electrode (that was positioned in ca3
stratum radiatum) were fed to a meyer & rentz amplifier (frankfurt,
germany). in these experiments the field potential was recorded
through the reference channel of the k1-selective electrode.
field potential, intracellular, and [k1]o recordings were displayed
on a digital oscilloscope and on a gould windograf recorder. they

some experiments a bipolar stainless steel electrode was used to
deliver extracellular stimuli (90 ms; ,1,800 ma) to the hilus of the
dentate gyrus.

database and analysis
our study is based on the use of .60 slices that were analyzed with
field potential, intracellular, and/or [k1]o recordings. the electrophysiological characteristics of ca3 pyramidal cells recorded with
k-acetate–filled electrodes were 1) rmp measured after electrode
withdrawal was 268.1 6 5.0 mv (mean 6 sd, n 5 11); 2) action
potential amplitude calculated from the baseline of 91.7 6 9.5 mv
(n 5 18); apparent input resistance obtained from the maximum
voltage response induced by small (,0.5 na) hyperpolarizing current
pulses of 27.3 6 7.5 mv (n 5 13). injection of depolarizing current
pulses in these cells caused regular spiking activity with adaptation
that was followed by a long-lasting afterhyperpolarization (160 –250
ms) on pulse termination.
throughout the paper measurements are expressed as means 6 sd,

data obtained under control conditions, and during any experimental

results

 xxxd1804xxx –induced synchronous activity
three different types of spontaneous synchronous activity
were recorded in the ca3 stratum radiatum of juvenile rat

hippocampal slices during  xxxd1804xxx  application (avoli et al. 1993,
1996). brief, positive interictal-like discharges (duration, 300 –
800 ms; rate of occurrence, 0.2– 0.9 hz; fig. 1, a and b, arrows
in control) and negative potentials (duration, 300 –900 ms; rate
of occurrence, 0.007– 0.23 hz; fig. 1, a and b, asterisks in
control) were present in all slices (n 5 42). in addition,
ictal-like discharges (duration, 5.4 –11.0 s; rate of occurrence,
0.004 – 0.011 hz) were seen in 19/42 slices (fig. 1b, continuous line in control). each ictal discharge was preceded, and
thus appeared to be initiated by a negative-going field potential
(fig. 1b, control).
we have reported that both interictal-like and ictal-like
(thereafter referred to as interictal and ictal) discharges induced
by  xxxd1804xxx  are insensitive to nmda receptor antagonists, but are
abolished by cnqx (avoli et al. 1993, 1996). we have also
shown that the negative-going potentials are insensitive to
excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists, but are blocked by
m-opioid receptor activation, or gabaa receptor antagonists.
hence we shall refer to these events as synchronous, gabamediated potentials.
effects induced by baclofen on the  xxxd1804xxx –induced
synchronous activity
application of the  xxxg828xxx  agonist baclofen (10, 25,
and 50 mm) decreased and eventually blocked the  xxxd1804xxx –induced
interictal activity in all experiments (n 5 29, fig. 1, a and b,
baclofen). we analyzed the effects induced by increasing doses of
baclofen in 12 slices. with 10 mm baclofen, a decrease in the rate
of occurrence of interictal discharges occurred in 5/12 slices,
whereas abolishment was seen in the remaining experiments (n 5

n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor antagonist 3,3-(2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphate (cpp; 10 mm), but is
abolished by the non-nmda receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (cnqx; 10 mm). b: ictal activity is

interictal discharges reappear and decreases the interval of occurrence of the gaba-mediated potentials; note, however, that the
ictal discharges induced by baclofen continue to occur in the presence of cgp 35348.

baclofen and seizure activity

fig. 3. a: simultaneous extracellular (top
trace) and intracellular (bottom trace, k-acetate–filled electrode) recordings made from the
ca3 area of a slice in the presence of  xxxd1804xxx 
only (control) and during baclofen (25 mm)
application. under control conditions (i.e.,
 xxxd1804xxx ), interictal discharges and gaba-mediated synchronous potentials (asterisk) are observed. the sample in ab shows an interictal
discharge that was reproduced at a faster time
base than in aa; note that in this experiment
the interictal field potential is of negative
polarity due to an electrode position in the
stratum radiatum that was close to stratum
pyramidale. baclofen induces a 6-mv hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential
(rmp), makes interictal events disappear, and
discloses ictal discharges that are initiated
by gaba-mediated potentials. note that in
this neuron the long-lasting depolarizations
(llds) increased in amplitude during baclofen application. b: baclofen abolishes the
presumptive, asynchronous action potential–
dependent, synaptic events that occur spontaneously in  xxxd1804xxx – containing medium (control). recordings were made at 258 mv
(which was the rmp of this ca3 pyramidal
cell in control) and at 275 mv. asterisks in
the control traces indicate truncated action potentials. c: plot of the amplitudes of the presumptive, action potential– dependent synaptic
events recorded at 258 mv (rmp) and at 275

each experimental condition. same neuron as
in b.

7). when interictal activity was not fully abolished by 10 mm
baclofen, increasing the concentration to 25 mm caused further
reduction (n 5 3) or disappearance (n 5 2). finally, no interictal
discharge was observed with 50 mm baclofen (n 5 2). complete
blockade of interictal discharges was also induced by application
of a single concentration of baclofen (25 and 50 mm in 9 and 8
slices respectively).
baclofen made spontaneous ictal activity appear when absent
in control (n 5 21/29; fig. 1a) or increased the duration of
preexisting ictal discharges. in the latter case the rate of occurrence of the ictal events decreased (n 5 8/29; fig. 1b). the
dose-dependent changes induced by baclofen on the rate of occurrence and the duration of the ictal discharges are shown in fig.
1c. baclofen also decreased the rate of occurrence of the gabamediated potential in a dose-dependent fashion (fig. 1c).
baclofen effects could be washed out in most experiments.
pharmacology of the activity recorded in the presence of
 xxxd1804xxx  and baclofen
as previously reported with  xxxd1804xxx  only (avoli et al. 1993,
1996), cpp did not influence the pattern of gaba-mediated

potential/ictal discharge recorded in baclofen 1  xxxd1804xxx  (n 5 8,
fig. 2a). moreover, baclofen disclosed ictal activity when
slices were pretreated with cpp (n 5 5, fig. 2b). ictal discharges were, however, abolished by further addition of
cnqx, a procedure that did not influence the gaba-mediated
potentials (n 5 5; fig. 2c). when the  xxxg828xxx  antagonist cgp 35348 (1 mm; n 5 4) was applied to slices treated
with  xxxd1804xxx  1 baclofen, interictal activity reappeared (fig. 2b),
whereas gaba-mediated potentials occurred at a higher rate
(from 0.0023 6 0.0004 hz during 50 mm baclofen to 0.014 6
0.0026 hz after adding cgp 35348, n 5 4). cgp 35348 also
reduced the duration of the ictal discharges that occurred more
frequently than with baclofen only.
intracellular features of the effects induced by baclofen
the intracellular counterpart of the synchronous activity
induced by  xxxd1804xxx  in the ca3 area of juvenile hippocampal
slices has been described (see avoli et al. 1993). in agreement
with these earlier experiments, whenever present, ictal discharges corresponded to prolonged depolarizations with sustained action potential firing (n 5 3 cells, not shown). by

fig. 4. a: samples of intracellular recordings performed with a k-acetate filled electrode in control (i.e.,  xxxd1804xxx ), during addition
of excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists (cnqx 1 cpp) and further application of baclofen (cnqx 1 cpp 1 baclofen).
note that spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials and epileptiform activity disappear during application of cnqx 1 cpp,
while inhibitory hyperpolarizing events and llds continue to occur. further addition of baclofen blocks most of these inhibitory
synaptic hyperpolarizations, while the lld can still be seen. this neuron rmp was kept throughout the experiment at the value
seen under control conditions (i.e., 262 mv) by injecting steady intracellular current. b: intracellular recordings performed with
a kcl-filled electrode in control (i.e.,  xxxd1804xxx  1 cnqx 1 cpp) and after further application of baclofen (baclofen). under control
conditions the spontaneous activity generated by this neuron consists of depolarizing (presumptive gabaa-mediated) postsynaptic
potentials (psps) and llds that lack the initial hyperpolarizing component. during baclofen the spontaneous gabaa-mediated
depolarizations are virtually abolished; the lld is only reduced in amplitude. c: plots of the peak amplitudes and of the rate of
occurrence of psps and llds recorded with kcl-filled electrodes in 5 neurons under control conditions ( xxxd1804xxx  1 cnqx 1 cpp)
and during addition of baclofen. measurements were performed in all cases by keeping the neuron rmp at the values seen under
control conditions with the injection of steady intracellular current.

contrast, interictal events and gaba-mediated potentials
(which occurred in all experiments) were mirrored by brief
depolarizations with action potential burst and by long-lasting
depolarizations (llds) with no or minimal action potential
firing, respectively (n 5 8 cells, fig. 3a, control).
spontaneous, asynchronous synaptic potentials were also
recorded from ca3 pyramids between synchronous events
(avoli et al. 1993; perreault and avoli 1991, 1992). recordings with k-acetate–filled electrodes revealed that these potentials consisted at rmp of hyperpolarizing and depolarizing
events occurring at 5–13 hz (n 5 5; fig. 3b, control, 258 mv
trace). membrane hyperpolarization to values more negative
than 270 mv did not appear to influence their occurrence rate;
however, most of them became depolarizing, while the remaining hyperpolarizing events were of smaller amplitudes as compared with rmp (fig. 3b, control, 275 mv trace).

baclofen (25 mm) application to  xxxd1804xxx – containing medium
induced a 4.8 6 1.3 mv, steady hyperpolarization of the rmp
and disappearance of interictal activity (n 5 8), whereas ictal
discharges increased in duration (n 5 3; not shown) or appeared whenever absent under control conditions (n 5 5; fig.
3a, baclofen). during application of  xxxd1804xxx  1 baclofen, ictal
events were initiated by llds with duration that appeared to
be longer than in control (not shown, but see figs. 3a and 5a).
in all experiments baclofen reduced the occurrence of, and
eventually abolished, the spontaneous asynchronous synaptic
potentials; these changes paralleled the disappearance of interictal activity and either the appearance or the potentiation of
ictal discharges.
to better establish the effects of baclofen on  xxxd1804xxx –induced
asynchronous synaptic potentials and llds, we used excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists while recording ca3

pyramids with electrodes filled with k-acetate (n 5 3) or kcl
(n 5 6). both hyperpolarizing synaptic potentials and llds
(that were initiated by a hyperpolarization) were recorded with
k-acetate–filled electrodes during  xxxd1804xxx  1 cnqx 1 cpp (fig.
4a). in these experiments baclofen (25 mm) abolished the
asynchronous potentials, but only caused a small reduction of
the llds’ amplitude (fig. 4a) while decreasing their rate of
occurrence (not illustrated).
these baclofen effects were also analyzed in six cells with
kcl-filled electrodes during application of  xxxd1804xxx  and excitatory
amino acid receptor antagonists. as shown in fig. 4b, asynchronous, presumptive gabaa-mediated depolarizing potentials and llds occurred in medium containing  xxxd1804xxx  1
cnqx 1 cpp. in all cases baclofen induced a steady membrane hyperpolarization (6.0 6 2.1 mv, n 5 5) and markedly
reduced the amplitude and the rate of occurrence of the asynchronous events. by contrast, it only exerted a nonsignificant
change in lld amplitude while the rate of occurrence of these
potentials decreased (fig. 4, b and c).
[k1]o and baclofen effects
[k1]o influences neuron excitability and modulates seizure
activity (mcbain et al. 1993; traynelis and dingledine 1988). in
addition gabaa-mediated [k1]o increases contribute to ictal
discharge initiation in the  xxxd1804xxx  model (avoli et al. 1996).
 xxxg828xxx  activation induces an increase in k1 conduc-

tance (dutar and nicoll 1988; gähwiler and brown 1985; newberry and nicoll 1984). we therefore used [k1]o recordings to
establish whether baclofen (25 mm) effects were accompanied by
changes in [k1]o baseline and/or in the transient elevations associated with the gaba-mediated potential/ictal discharge (avoli
et al. 1996). [k1]o baseline was unchanged with baclofen (n 5 5
slices). in addition, the initial component of the transient increases
in [k1]o corresponding to the gaba-mediated potentials had
similar peak values in control and during baclofen (fig. 5, a and
b). however, the increased duration of the ictal discharge induced
by baclofen was mirrored by [k1]o elevations that were more
prolonged than in control (arrows in fig. 5a).
we also established whether baclofen modifies the transient
[k1]o increases associated with the gaba-mediated potentials
recorded during application of  xxxd1804xxx  1 cpp 1 cnqx (n 5 5
slices). transient [k1]o elevations occurred in association with
the gaba-mediated potentials recorded during blockade of ionotropic excitatory amino acid receptors (fig. 6a) (avoli et al.
1996). these elevations in [k1]o decreased in amplitude by
15–25% during application of 25 mm baclofen, an effect that was
reversed by baclofen wash out (fig. 6a). the results obtained in
the course of these experiments are summarized in fig. 6b.

avoli 1997; bragdon et al. 1992; swartzwelder et al. 1987).
hence we tested whether stimulation of the dentate hilus at
0.2– 0.8 hz for period .15 min could abolish the ictal activity
generated by ca3 pyramidal cells during application of
4- xxxg1222xxx  baclofen (25 mm).
as illustrated in fig. 7a, ictal events recorded during application of  xxxd1804xxx  1 baclofen were reduced, or abolished during
this type of electrical stimulation in all experiments (n 5 8).
this effect was also characterized by reduction (2/8) or disappearance (6/8) of the gaba-mediated synchronous potentials.
ictal discharges reappeared at intervals similar to those seen in
control conditions (i.e.,  xxxd1804xxx  1 baclofen) on termination of
electrical stimuli (fig. 7b). moreover, the inhibitory effect
exerted by repetitive stimuli delivered in the dentate hilus on
ictal discharge occurrence was reproduced by successive periods of stimulation in the same experiment.
discussion

as reported in adult brain (lewis et al. 1989; mott et al.
1989; swartzwelder et al. 1987; watts and jefferys 1993),
activation of gabab receptors by baclofen exerts a proconvulsant action in the ca3 area of juvenile rat hippocampus that
is characterized by the appearance or potentiation of  xxxd1804xxx –
induced ictal discharges. in this study we have sought evidence
for the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and obtained
data indicating that such an action 1) results from the activation
of gabab receptors leading to a reduction of spontaneous
excitatory and inhibitory synaptic potentials along with the
disappearance of interictal discharges; 2) is associated with the

persistence of synchronous gaba-mediated potentials; 3) is
characterized by excitatory amino acid receptor pharmacology
for the ictal activity that is similar to what seen with  xxxd1804xxx  only;
and 4) is not accompanied by measurable changes in baseline
or transient [k1]o increases. we have also shown that the ictal
activity recorded in  xxxd1804xxx  1 baclofen is interrupted by lowfrequency repetitive electrical stimuli, a procedure that induces
interictal-like discharges.
baclofen effects on  xxxd1804xxx –induced, spontaneous activity
in our study most baclofen effects were antagonized by
cgp 35348, thus indicating that they were mainly caused by
the activation of gabab receptors. in particular, we propose that baclofen abolishes  xxxd1804xxx –induced asynchronous,
action potential– dependent synaptic events and interictal
activity by decreasing the release of transmitter from excitatory and inhibitory terminals. this may be caused by
activation of presynaptic gabab receptors inhibiting both
gaba and excitatory transmitter release (lambert and wilson 1993; lanthorn and cotman 1981; thompson and gähwiler 1992), and by a postsynaptic gabab-mediated hyperpolarization that decreases excitability of principal cells
(newberry and nicoll 1984, 1985) and interneurons (misgeld et al. 1989; williams and lacaille 1992). indeed, we
could document this hyperpolarizing action of baclofen in
all ca3 pyramidal cells that were recorded during continuous application of  xxxd1804xxx .
it is unclear why the synchronous gaba-mediated potentials continued to occur (although at a reduced rate)

baclofen and seizure activity

fig. 7. a: field potential and intracellular
(k-acetate–filled electrode) recordings obtained in the ca3 area during application of
 xxxd1804xxx  1 baclofen (25 mm) show that ictal
discharges are blocked during extracellular
stimulation of dentate hilus at 0.8 hz. rmp of
this pyramidal cell was 268 mv. b: plot of the
rate of occurrence of the ictal discharges during control conditions, during repetitive stimulation (0.2– 0.8 hz), and after stimulation arrest. data were obtained from 6 experiments.
in all cases  xxxd1804xxx  and baclofen (25 mm) were
present under the 3 experimental conditions.

during application of baclofen concentrations as high as 50
mm. baclofen may depress excitatory transmitter release to
a greater extent than gaba release (pierau and zimmermann 1973; potashner 1978). we are, however, inclined to
exclude that gabab receptors on inhibitory interneuron
terminals may have lower affinity for gaba (and baclofen)
as compared with those located on glutamatergic neurons,
because both inhibitory and excitatory asynchronous potentials recorded from ca3 pyramidal cells were decreased by
baclofen to a similar extent. such a difference in sensitivity
is also at odds with the proconvulsant action of baclofen
because ictal discharges are excitatory amino acid–mediated
synchronous events. indeed, the resistance of  xxxd1804xxx –induced
gaba-mediated synchronous potentials to baclofen may
reflect the intense discharge of action potential that occurs in
interneurons during this type of synchronous activity (benardo 1997). this firing, once reaching the terminals, may
overcome the inhibition of transmitter release exerted by
baclofen. moreover, this phenomenon may be facilitated by
the concomitant increase in [k1]o seen during the gabamediated synchronous potential.

proconvulsant action of baclofen in the juvenile rat
hippocampus
a proconvulsant action of baclofen has been described in
several in vitro models of epileptiform discharge in the adult
hippocampus (lewis et al. 1989; mott et al. 1989;
swartzwelder et al. 1987; watts and jefferys 1993). in particular, watts and jefferys (1993) have reported that baclofen
abolishes interictal activity and discloses ictal discharges in
adult rat hippocampal slices treated with  xxxd1804xxx . the similarities
between our results and their findings indicate the existence of
mature gabab-mediated mechanisms of synaptic transmission in the juvenile rat hippocampus. a proconvulsant effect of
baclofen has been shown in a patient treated for spasticity who
did not have any previous history of seizures (rush and gibberd 1990) and in three patients who had previously suffered
traumatic brain injury (kofler et al. 1994).
we have also shown that the ictal activity generated by ca3
neurons in the presence of  xxxd1804xxx  1 baclofen is insensitive to
the nmda receptor antagonist cpp, but is abolished by
cnqx. these features are similar to those reported for ictal
discharges in medium containing  xxxd1804xxx  only (avoli et al. 1993,

motalli et al.

1996). hence baclofen’s proconvulsant action does not result
from a novel excitatory amino acid–mediated mechanism disclosed by this gabab-receptor agonist. in addition, the effects
of baclofen did occur during continuous cpp application,
which rules out the involvement of a  xxxg828xxx –mediated/nmda-dependent mechanism in ictal discharge induction. such a mechanism facilitates the occurrence of tetanusinduced long-term potentiation in the adult hippocampus
(davies et al. 1991).
 xxxg828xxx  activation induces an increase in k1 conductance (gähwiler and brown 1985; newberry and nicoll
1984, 1985). it is also well-established that [k1]o modulates
seizure activity (mcbain et al. 1993; traynelis and dingledine
1988). hence the proconvulsant action of baclofen may have
resulted from changes in [k1]o homeostasis, and even more so
because gaba-mediated [k1]o elevations initiate ictal discharges in the  xxxd1804xxx  model (avoli et al. 1996). however, our
[k1]o recordings indicate that the action of baclofen is not
accompanied by any measurable change in either [k1]o baseline or [k1]o transient elevations. accordingly, the increases in
[k1]o occurring during the gaba-mediated synchronous potential recorded in the presence of baclofen were not larger
than those seen in medium containing  xxxd1804xxx  only. moreover,
only a small, although significant decrease was appreciated
when comparing the peak [k1]o values under control and
during baclofen in slices where excitatory transmission was
abolished.
it has been proposed that the proconvulsant action of baclofen is caused by disinhibition due to a decrease in gaba
release (mott et al. 1989; watts and jefferys 1993). in agreement with these studies, we have observed that baclofen causes
a marked decrease of asynchronous gabaa-mediated events
recorded from ca3 pyramids. however, such a disinhibitory
action must be accompanied by the ability of excitatory terminals to release transmitter to be expressed as a proconvulsant
effect. hence, as proposed for the synchronous gaba-mediated potentials, we are inclined to conclude that ictal activity
during activation of gabab receptors reflects the inability of
this presynaptic mechanism to inhibit transmitter release consequent to intense action potential firing, which in this case
does occur at the excitatory terminals of ca3 pyramidal cells.
an important mechanism underlying the proconvulsant action of baclofen relates to activity-dependent changes in ca3
area network excitability that occur during  xxxg828xxx 
activation. this conclusion is supported by the findings obtained with electrical stimulation of the dentate hilus, a procedure that leads to the occurrence of interictal-like responses
and the concomitant suppression of the ictal activity recorded
during application of  xxxd1804xxx  1 baclofen. it is conceivable that
an accumulation of glutamate-containing vesicles docking at
presynaptic terminals results from the block of interictal activity and asynchronous excitatory synaptic potentials caused by
baclofen. this should lead to an increased availability of excitatory transmitter. as a consequence the synchronous
gaba-mediated potentials that are generated in the presence
of baclofen initiate ictal discharges that are more robust than
those recorded under control conditions or induce ictal events
ex novo. presynaptic factors controlling glutamate release have
been proposed to regulate the probability and duration of
synchronous discharges generated by the ca3 network (staley
et al. 1998).

in clinical practice, interictal events are used to localize the
brain area from where ictal discharges originate. however, the
temporal relation between interictal and ictal discharges remains unclear. it should be emphasized that the control exerted
by interictal activity on ictal events has been shown in previous
studies including those performed in combined hippocampusentorhinal cortex slices treated with either  xxxd1804xxx  or low mg21
(barbarosie and avoli 1997; bragdon et al. 1992;
swartzwelder et al. 1987). in these cases as well, activitydependent changes in network excitability, leading to increased
availability of excitatory transmitter, may play a role in the
unexpected control exerted by interictal activity over ictal
discharges.
