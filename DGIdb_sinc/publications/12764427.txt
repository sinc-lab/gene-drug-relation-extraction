 xxxd2702xxx : a structurally novel, short-acting, hypoglycemic agent.   xxxd2702xxx  is a short-acting, pancreatic, beta-cell-selective, k(atp)  xxxg1232xxx  blocker that improves overall glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. although  xxxd2702xxx 's mechanism of action is related to that of sulphonyl-ureas and  xxxd3098xxx , important differences do exist.  xxxd2702xxx  binds rapidly to the sulfonylurea  xxxg19xxx  receptor with a relatively low affinity, and it dissociates from it extremely rapidly in a manner of seconds. this rapid association and dissociation gives  xxxd2702xxx  a unique "fast on-fast off" effect. thus,  xxxd2702xxx  has a rapid onset and short duration of action stimulating insulin secretion in vivo and providing good control of postprandial hyperglycemia when taken immediately prior to meals. the rapid action of  xxxd2702xxx  on the beta cells stimulates and restores the normal physiological first and early phase of insulin secretion, consequently reducing postprandial hyperglycemia. this hypoglycemic effect of  xxxd2702xxx  leads to improved glycemic control, while the short duration avoids delayed hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia after meals.  xxxd2702xxx  is not a sulfonylurea, but it shares the mechanism of action of commonly used oral hypoglycemic agents such as  xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd2204xxx . like the recently introduced, short-acting agent,  xxxd3098xxx , it does not incorporate a sulfonylurea moiety. however,  xxxd2702xxx 's effects on insulin secretion and glycemic control differ significantly from the sulfonylureas and  xxxd3098xxx  in that it preferentially stimulates acute phase insulin, better controls postprandial glucose excursions and spikes, and causes less hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia. compounds with such a profile should not only achieve improved overall glucose control, but also reduce the risk of vascular complications which is the most important feature of  xxxd2702xxx . clinical studies with  xxxd2702xxx  have confirmed that it acts rapidly and both restores insulin release and attenuates the postprandial glucose spike.  xxxd2702xxx  is both effective and well tolerated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. the reported overall profile of adverse effects appears to be superior to that of other k(atp)  xxxg1232xxx  blockers, the glucose modulator metformin and  xxxg1807xxx  agonists such as troglitazone. clinical comparisons of these agents have shown  xxxd2702xxx  to be more effective in attenuating postprandial glucose than any other oral hypoglycemic agent, and that treatment with both  xxxd2702xxx  and metformin provides additive effects that afford improved control of plasma glucose levels. the administration regimen for  xxxd2702xxx , immediately prior to meals, also facilitates patient compliance.
