summary
systematic thin layer chromatographic (tlc) analysis
of  xxxd1850xxx  lipids in mycobacterium kansasii revealed
the presence of a previously uncharacterized novel
component. the product was ubiquitously found in a
panel of m. kansasii clinical isolates, as well as other
pathogenic and non-pathogenic mycobacterial species. tlc analysis of [14c]-acetate- or [14c]-glycerollabelled m. kansasii cultures tentatively assigned the
novel product as an unusual triacylglycerol-related
lipid. subsequent purification, followed by structural
determination using 1h-nuclear magnetic resonance
(nmr) and electrospray mass spectrometry (es/ms),
led to the identification of this product as a monomeromycolyl-diacylglycerol (mmdag). treatment of m.
kansasii with either isoniazid (inh), a well-known type
ii  xxxg765xxx  (fas-ii) and mycolic acid biosynthesis inhibitor, or  xxxd2792xxx  (thl), a drug
approved for treating obesity, correlated with a
reduced incorporation of [14c]-acetate into both
mycolic acids and mmdag. addition of inh or thl to
the cultures induced major morphological changes
and, surprisingly, resulted in an increased number of
lipid storage bodies, as determined by electron

microscopy. the potent antimycobacterial activity of
thl was confirmed against a variety of mycobacterial
species, including inh-susceptible and -resistant
mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. therefore, thl
and other b-lactones may be promising drugs for the
development of new antitubercular therapy.
introduction
the mycobacterial cell envelope, also called the ‘waxy
coat’, contains a remarkable array of lipids and glycolipids
(minnikin, 1982; daffé and draper, 1998; minnikin et al.,
2002; kremer and besra, 2004), and has been the subject
of intensive research. few organisms have evolved to
produce such a diverse collection of lipophilic structures
as in mycobacterium tuberculosis (minnikin et al., 2002).
the mycobacterial cell wall is unique, consisting of three
covalently linked polymers, peptidoglycan, arabinogalactan (ag) and mycolic acids (brennan and nikaido, 1995).
peptidoglycan is attached to ag via a phosphodiester
bridge and about two-thirds of the non-reducing termini of
ag are esterified with mycolic acids (mcneil et al., 1991).
this covalently linked cell wall skeleton is often referred
to as the mycolyl–arabinogalactan–peptidoglycan complex (magp) (brennan and nikaido, 1995). it is considered that the cell wall-bound mycolic acids form a
monolayer lipid structure whose outer leaflet interacts with
a range of unusual ‘extractable’ lipids to form a coherent
lipid bilayer (minnikin, 1982). these complex free lipids
range in polarity from  xxxd1850xxx  triacylglycerols (tag), phthiocerol dimycocerosates to polar glycopeptidolipids and
lipooligosaccharides (minnikin, 1982; brennan and
nikaido, 1995). many more potential lipid biosynthetic
activities can be deduced from the m. tuberculosis
genome sequence than there are known products in in
vitro-grown tubercle bacilli, raising the possibility that
many novel lipid species remain to be isolated and
characterized.
triacylglycerols are essentially present in animals,
plants and eukaryotic microorganisms, such as plasmodium falciparum (vielemeyer et al., 2004), as the major
lipid storage molecules. although rather uncommon in
prokaryotes, recent work reported tag accumulation in
different bacteria, mainly in those belonging to the actinomycetes genera, including nocardia (alvarez and steinbüchel, 2002), rhodococcus (alvarez et al., 2000),

teria, consisting of a novel tag bearing a meromycolate
substituent. this lipid was ubiquitously found in all mycobacterial species tested, including pathogenic species,
emphasizing an important function in mycobacterial physiology. its potential role as a source of meromycolates
during mycolic acid biosynthesis is discussed.

streptomyces (olukoshi and packter, 1994) and mycobacterium (garton et al., 2002; daniel et al., 2004). streptomyces have been observed to accumulate tag as lipid
bodies in mycelia at the stationary phase of growth (packter and olukoshi, 1995). it has also been suggested that
tag may act as a carbon source for the production of
secondary metabolites, such as antibiotics (olukoshi and
packter, 1994). studies on the environmental isolate
rhodococcus opacus strain pd630 have demonstrated
the accumulation and mobilization of tags into intracytoplasmic lipid inclusions (alvarez et al., 1996; 2000). a
recent mechanism of lipid body formation, different from
the current models of lipid inclusion in eukaryotes, has
been proposed in acinetobacter calcoaceticus and r.
opacus (wältermann et al., 2005).
interestingly, previous investigations in the pathogenic
m. tuberculosis strain indicated an important role of lipid
accumulation in vitro and in human sputum (garton et al.,
2002). the proposed storage role of lipidic inclusions and
tags may be advantageous for mycobacteria in vivo and
be relevant to survival in a non-replicating state. this
notion was recently supported with the evidence that diacylglycerol acyltransferases involved in tag biosynthesis
are upregulated in stationary-phase m. tuberculosis cultures and that tag accumulates in dormant-like cultures
(daniel et al., 2004). overall, these findings indicate that
tag biosynthesis and accumulation are important
aspects of mycobacterial lipid metabolism, and suggest
that tag represents a potential target for treatment of
mycobacterial diseases.
the work presented in this report was undertaken to
identify and characterize new mycobacterial lipids in order
to decipher new sources of lipid structural diversity in
mycobacteria. we describe here the identification and
structural characterization of an unusual lipid in mycobac-

identification of a new  xxxd1850xxx  lipid in mycobacterium
kansasii
to identify novel mycobacterial lipids in the clinical strain
mycobacterium kansasii phri 901, the mycobacteria
were grown in the presence of [1,2-14c]-acetate, and the
total  xxxd1850xxx  and polar lipids were extracted and analysed
by thin layer chromatography (tlc) spanning the whole
range of lipid polarities (besra, 1998). figure 1a shows a
typical two-dimensional tlc (2d-tlc) profile of total  xxxd1850xxx  lipids from m. kansasii phri 901, characterized by an
intense spot (surrounded by a circle) known to correspond to tag, according to dobson et al. (1985).
figure 1b illustrates the purity of the material corresponding to this spot, following extraction with  xxxd2052xxx  and
resolution using petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (98/2)
thrice in the first dimension and petroleum ether/acetone
(98/2) in the second dimension. when another solvent
system was used [petroleum ether/acetone (95/5) in the
first dimension and toluene/acetone (99/1) in second
dimension], the purified tag shown in fig. 1b gave rise
to a second lipid component, referred to as ‘ xxxd1850xxx  lipid’
in addition to the major spot identified as tag (fig. 1c).
this new product appeared to be less polar than tag,
suggesting that it may be a related more hydrophobic
tag.

figure 2b shows that the product is present in mycobacterium gastri atcc 15754, m. bovis bcg 1173p2, m.
smegmatis mc2155 and m. thermoresistibile atcc 19527.
this lipid is thus not unique to m. kansasii but ubiquitous
in mycobacterial species, suggesting that it might be
involved in important physiological functions.

lipid was restricted to m. kansasii phri 901, we analysed

 xxxd1850xxx  lipids from acetate-labelled cultures. as illustrated
in fig. 2a for a representative tlc of 12 independent
isolates, the  xxxd1850xxx  lipid was found in all strains examined.

radiography revealed that both the tag and the  xxxd1850xxx 
lipid were labelled (data not shown), indicating that the
latter also contained a glycerol moiety. this component
was tentatively referred to as ‘ xxxd1850xxx -tag’.
to determine the structure of  xxxd1850xxx -tag, 1h-nuclear
magnetic resonance (1h-nmr) spectra of both apolartag and tag purified from m. kansasii atcc 12478 were
determined and were found to be similar to that of a
commercial standard glycerol-tritetradecanoate (trimyristin). for trimyristin, the following resonances were
present: d0.85 (terminal ch3, 9h, triplet), 1.23 (ch2,
broad), 1.58 (ch2·ch2·coo, 6h, distorted triplet), 2.28
(ch2·coo, 6h, two overlapping triplets), 4.09, 4.13, 4.25,
4.28 (ch2·ooc, 4 1h, four doublets), 5.23 (ch·ooc, 1h,
multiplet). this indicated that the latter resulted from the
ch2·coo group esterified at the 2-position of the glycerol, whereas the former resulted from these groups
esterified at the 1- and 3-positions of glycerol. these
signals were also present in the 1h-nmr spectra of the
two m. kansasii tag components, although their chemical
shift were slightly more downfield, as shown in fig. 3a
and b for resonances a–m. the precise values for these
signals were d0.87 (d), 1.23 (e), 1.59 (f), 2.30 (h), 4.11 (i),
4.15 (j), 4.26 (k), 4.30 (l), 5.25 (m) and 0.87 (d) 1.23 (e),
1.59 (f), 2.30 (h), 4.12 (i), 4.15 (j), 4.27 (k), 4.30 (l), 5.25
(m) for tag (fig. 3a) and  xxxd1850xxx -tag (fig. 3b)
respectively. additionally, both spectra contained resonances indicative of double bonds at d2.0 (g)
(ch2ch=ch2, 4h, multiplet) and d5.33 (n) (cis-ch=ch,
2h, distorted triplet). the integration of these signals suggested that monounsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  accounted for
approximately one-third of the total  xxxd2154xxx  in both tag
forms, assuming that  xxxd2154xxx  with a greater degree of
unsaturation were absent, which was supported by gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (gc/ms) analyses
(see below). the spectrum (fig. 3b) of  xxxd1850xxx -tag contained multiplets at d0.35 (a), 0.55 (b) and 0.63 (c), indicating the presence of cis-cyclopropane rings, which are
suggestive of the mero-chain portion of mycolic acids.
analysis by electrospray mass spectrometry (es/ms)
revealed a series of sodiated molecular ions, m/z 797.7/
799.8–909.9/911.8, differing by 28 amu for tag (fig. 4).
several attempts to obtain similar data for  xxxd1850xxx -tag
were unsuccessful.
alkaline deacylation followed by methylation of both
tag forms released petroleum ether-extractable fatty
acids, which co-chromatographed on tlc with a c12-c24
straight-chain fatty acid methyl ester (fame) standard [rf
0.46; petroleum ether/acetone (98/2, v/v)].  xxxd1850xxx -tag
also gave rise to a second fame, which was less polar
(rf 0.64) than the c12-c24 fame standard. the results of
the gc and gc/ms analysis of the fames, migrating on
tlc (rf 0.46) with the standard, are shown in table 1. in
both tag and  xxxd1850xxx -tag, c16 was a major component

with substantial amounts of c18 and c18:1. only the fames
from tag contained large amounts of c20-c26 fames, with
c24 particularly abundant. the involatile  xxxd1850xxx  fames
released from the  xxxd1850xxx -tag did not produce a gc and
gc/ms profile.
the 1h-nmr spectra of the  xxxd1850xxx  fames released
from  xxxd1850xxx -tag possessed characteristic resonances of
a cis-cyclopropane ring-containing fame, originally
observed in the 1h-nmr spectrum of native  xxxd1850xxx -tag
(fig. 3b). electron impact/mass spectrometry (ei/ms)
analysis showed a series of peaks ranging from m/z 672–
840, and differing by 14 amu, corresponding to the molecular ions of dicyclopropyl fames ranging from 45 to 57
carbons in the parent fatty acid. the major peak was at
m/z 756, corresponding to a fatty acid of 51 carbons, and
peaks corresponding to odd carbon-chain  xxxd2154xxx  also
predominated. the 1h-nmr spectrum of native apolartag suggested one meromycolate chain per molecule of
 xxxd1850xxx -tag. this implies that the  xxxd1850xxx  lipid was a monomeromycolyl diacylglycerol (mmdag), which would
account for its  xxxd1850xxx  characteristics relative to tag
(fig. 5).
expression profile of tag and mmdag during
growth of m. kansasii
work performed in m. smegmatis suggested that tag
accumulation was essentially dependent of the medium
as well as the age of the culture (garton et al., 2002).
however, little is know about the time-course of these
lipids in other mycobacteria. we therefore examined
whether growth phase may affect tag/mmdag production in m. kansasii. figure 6a illustrates the growth curve
of m. kansasii phri 901, characterized by a dense culture
after 2 weeks of incubation in sauton medium. samples
were collected at various time points during growth, and

extracted and resolved by 2d-tlc/autoradiography.
figure 6b shows that both the tag and the mmdag pools
increased significantly during growth, especially during
the late log phase. this is in agreement with findings
suggesting that tag accumulated in m. tuberculosis cells
going into the non-replicative state (daniel et al., 2004).
these results suggest that production of mmdag and
tag are growth state-dependent.

biosynthesis of the mmdag is type i fatty acid
synthase (fas-i)-independent
in mycobacteria, two types of  xxxg765xxx  (fas)
systems coexist, fas-i and fas-ii (kremer et al., 2000).
cell-free experiments demonstrated that, fas-i provides
the c12 acyl primers used by fas-ii for further elongation,
yielding long-chain c14-c26  xxxd2154xxx  up to c56 meromycolic acids, which are the precursors of mycolic acids.

fig. 4. es/ms analysis of tag. the purified
tag from m. kansasii phri 901 were analysed
using es/ms in the positive ion mode on a triple
quadropole lct instrument (micromass, altrincham, uk) fitted with an atmospheric pressure
electrospray source. the samples were directly
injected using a rheodyne injector with methanol as the mobile phase. the machine was run
at a flow rate of 200 ml min-1 with the cone voltage at 35 v and the spraying needle voltage set
at 3 kv. the scan rate was 1 s, and the mass
range was from 200 to 2000.

 xxxd463xxx  (cer), an inhibitor of mycobacterial fas-i (parrish et al., 1999; boshoff et al., 2002), was used to determine the role of fas-i in tag and mmdag biosynthesis.
when m. kansasii cultures were pre-treated with cer, the
incorporation of label into the  xxxd2154xxx  of tag was
drastically diminished (fig. 7a), supporting the notion that
the acyl chains of tag originate from fas-i. in contrast,
cer treatment resulted in the accumulation of mmdag,
suggesting that the glycerol-bound acyl chains of
mmdag, in contrast to tag, were synthesized independently of fas-i, presumably via fas-ii.

to a glycerol moiety, and as meromycolates are direct
precursors of mycolic acids, we examined the effect of
the mycolic acid biosynthesis inhibitor inh on mmdag
biosynthesis. m. kansasii phri 901, highly susceptible
to killing by inh (table 2), was treated with increasing
concentrations of inh and labelled with [1,2-14c]-acetate. mycolic acid methyl esters (mames) and fames
were extracted and analysed by tlc. as expected, inh
affects the synthesis of a, methoxy and ketomycolates
(fig. 7b). synthesis of the mames was completely
abrogated at 5 mg  xxxg1167xxx  of inh, whereas fames
remained unaffected, as previously described for other
mycobacterial species (vilchèze et al., 2000; kremer
et al., 2003). interestingly, a more  xxxd1850xxx  band which
migrates ahead of the fames (fig. 7b) is also inhibited

fig. 6. influence of the growth state on tag/mmdag production in m. kansasii.
a. growth of m. kansasii phri 901 in sauton medium (without shaking) was monitored by measuring the optical density at 600 nm. samples
were collected for analysis of the  xxxd1850xxx  lipid profile at various time points as indicated (from 1 to 6).
b. cultures were labelled with [1,2-14c]-acetate for 16 h at various time points as indicated by the numbers (from 1 to 6). following extraction,
 xxxd1850xxx  lipids were developed in petroleum ether/acetone (95/5) in the first dimension and toluene/acetone (99/1) in the second dimension.
approximately 50 000 counts were loaded for each tlc plate and exposed overnight.

by inh (and thl see below), which are possibly very
long-chain fames, presumably meromycolates. the biosynthesis of mmdag was also inhibited upon inh treatment, while synthesis of tag remained relatively
unaffected (fig. 7c). as inh inhibits fas-ii activity, the
c45-c57 meromycolate substituent of mmdag are most
likely synthesized via fas-ii, consistent with the fact
that mmdag synthesis is insensitive to the fas-i inhibitor cer.
 xxxd2792xxx  (thl) belongs to a well-characterized family of esterase inhibitors, which have been shown
to be selective and irreversible inhibitors of pancreatic
lipases (hadváry et al., 1991). the common structural
feature of thl is the reactive b-lactone ring (fig. 7d).
given the structural analogy between thl and mycolic
acids, we examined whether thl may inhibit the biosynthesis of mycolic acids and mmdag. as shown in fig. 7b,
thl partially inhibited the incorporation of acetate in
mycolic acids. therefore, compared with inh for which a
complete cessation of mycolic acid production was
observed, thl inhibited only partially mycolic acid biosynthesis. a plateau of inhibition was achieved at around the
minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) value (40 mg  xxxg1167xxx )
and no further inhibition could be observed even at higher
thl doses (up to 250 mg  xxxg1167xxx , data not shown). as
observed for inh, thl did not appear to inhibit tag biosynthesis. however, as shown in fig. 7c, thl also inhibited the incorporation of acetate into mmdag in a dosedependent manner.

mycolic acids and on meromycolate analogues prompted
us to investigate whether thl exhibits antimycobacterial
activity. the mic of thl for various mycobacteria, including pathogenic and non-pathogenic species (table 2),
was determined. the mic value for m. kansasii and m.
bovis bcg was approximately 30 mg  xxxg1167xxx . interestingly,
the saprophytic strain m. smegmatis was found to be
resistant to thl treatment with an mic value >250 mg
 xxxg1167xxx . we also examined the effect of thl on m. tuberculosis strains and found that the drug inhibited growth of
both inh-sensitive and inh-resistant m. tuberculosis, with
mic values of about 30 mg  xxxg1167xxx  in both cases (table 2).
thus, thl and related b-lactones may potentially be used
as new antitubercular drugs effective even against inhresistant strains.

effect of inh and thl on the ultrastructural
appearance of m. kansasii
it was previously reported that the treatment of susceptible strains of m. aurum and m. tuberculosis with inh
results in different morphological changes that can be
visualized by electron microscopy (em) (bardou et al.,
1996). to determine whether inh or thl treatment had
any incidence on the morphological appearance of m.

electron microscopy (sem). bacteria kept their rod shape
and no major differences in cell width or length were
observed between untreated and inh- or thl-treated
bacteria. for all three cases, the size of the bacteria was
heterogeneous in the sense that about 10% of the bacteria were either more rounded or much longer than the bulk
of the population. in contrast, drug treatments induced
surface modifications, i.e. the appearance of small blebs
at the surface of inh-treated m. kansasii, consistent with

previous observations for m. smegmatis- or m. tuberculosis-treated cultures (takayama et al., 1973; vilchèze
et al., 2000), and small depressions in thl-treated ones
(fig. 8). in addition, observation of thin sections by tem
showed major differences in terms of degradation. only
about 10% of the population of untreated bacteria were
degraded, as defined by the integrity of the cell wall,
cytoplasmic membrane or cytoplasm (fréhel et al., 1997),
whereas up to 40% of the treated bacteria were in the
process of being degraded. given the inhibitory effect of
both drugs on mycolic acid and mmdag biosynthesis, we
next focused our attention on the appearance of the cell
wall and intracellular lipid bodies, which have been pro© 2005 blackwell publishing ltd, molecular microbiology, 57, 1113–1126

the fixatives in order to stabilize and stain lipids confirmed
that the inclusions contained lipids (fig. 9d). in some
instances, the entire cytoplasm was filled with small lipid
bodies, suggesting that the bacteria stored increasingly
larger amounts of lipids following drug treatment.
discussion
the present study describes the isolation of an unusual
tag-related molecule, characterized by the presence of a
meromycolate substituent esterified to glycerol (fig. 5),
which we named mmdag. although very minor as compared with the overall pool of tag, mmdag was detected
in a panel of 31 independent clinical isolates of m. kan-

sasii, as well as in several other mycobacterial strains,
including pathogenic and non-pathogenic species, suggesting that this molecule may play an important physiological role. actinomycetes, including mycobacterium,
accumulate large amounts of tag, providing a carbon and

energy source for maintaining viability during nutrient starvation (alvarez et al., 2000; alvarez and steinbüchel,
2002). tag represent a source of  xxxd2154xxx  for the biosynthesis of phospholipids, as well as a carrier of unusual
 xxxd2154xxx  involved in regulating fatty acid composition of
membrane lipids. therefore, in addition to serving as an
inert lipid deposit, tag plays an important role in the
metabolism of lipid-accumulating bacteria. it has also
been suggested that the occurrence of significant
amounts of tag in mycobacteria could be one of the
factors that determine the wide distribution of these microorganisms in nature and their ability to cope with adverse
environmental conditions, providing them with an evolutionary advantage over other bacteria (alvarez and steinbüchel, 2002). tag is also the major component of
mycobacterial lipid bodies (garton et al., 2002). given the
structural relatedness between mmdag and tag, it is
very likely that mmdag is also stored in lipid bodies,
although this remains to be clearly demonstrated. the
latter have been shown to sequester and store  xxxd2154xxx ,
especially when conditions become unfavourable for
mycobacterial growth (garton et al., 2002). our results
show that m. kansasii accumulates both tag and mmdag
during exponential growth, especially during late log
phase. this growth phase dependency is consistent with
the observation from daniel et al. (2004) showing that
tag synthesis is upregulated in stationary-phase m.
tuberculosis. mycolic acid biosynthesis occurs intracellularly, but the final products are mainly localized within the
cell wall. takayama and armstrong (1976; 1977) noted an
early labelling of 6-mycolyl-6¢-acetyl trehalose (mat) in m.
tuberculosis, and proposed that mat is an intermediate
carrier for newly synthesized mycolates, which are then
transferred to trehalose dimycolate (tdm) and ag. in
addition, a 6-mycolyl-b-d-mannopyranosyl-phosphopolyprenol has also been isolated from m. smegmatis and
proposed to serve as a mycolyl carrier that transfers
mycolic acid residues to trehalose monomycolate (tmm),
tdm and cell wall ag (besra et al., 1994). by analogy
with these molecules, mmdag may represent another
intermediate ‘carrier’ of newly synthesized meromycolates. however, the main meromycolate component of the
dicyclopropyl a-mycolates from m. kansasii has x = 17,
y = 14, z = 17 (fig. 5) (watanabe et al., 2002), corresponding to an even-numbered meromycolate with 56
carbons. there appears to be no direct relationship therefore between the main odd-numbered 51 carbon component of the mmdag (fig. 5). further detailed experiments
are required to elucidate the precise relationship between
mmdag and the other mycolate-containing entities
present in mycobacteria. as mmdag appear being produced in exponentially growing bacteria, and as replicating mycobacteria are believed to actively synthesize
mycolic acids, our results suggest that mmdag may rep© 2005 blackwell publishing ltd, molecular microbiology, 57, 1113–1126

resent a ‘carrier’ of mycolic acid precursors in growing
cells.
the control of tuberculosis is seriously hampered by the
emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of m. tuberculosis. therefore, new approaches to the treatment of tuberculosis are needed (kremer and besra, 2002). tag and/
or mmdag may constitute attractive targets for novel drug
development, as alterations of these compounds is
expected to affect lipid metabolism and/or mycolic acid
synthesis or transfer of mycolic acids to the cell wall and
thus the mycobacteria’s ability to survive in a non-replicative state of dormancy. we provide evidence that thl
exhibits antimycobacterial activity against various pathogenic strains, including inh-sensitive and inh-resistant
m. tuberculosis. thl is known to inhibit digestive lipases,
including pancreatic lipases from several species and
human gastric lipases (borgström, 1988; hadváry et al.,
1991). it is currently used for the treatment of obesity, and
has been associated with significantly greater weight loss
than that seen with dieting alone (thearle and aronne,
2003). our results suggest that treatment with thl was
correlated with partial inhibition of mycolic acid biosynthesis, although to a lesser extent than inh, which completely
abrogated mycolic acid biosynthesis. in addition, both the
amount and the size of lipid bodies increased after treatment with either inh or thl, suggesting that precursors
of mycolic acids accumulate within these bodies, possibly
as a consequence of mycolic acid biosynthesis inhibition.
vilchèze et al. (2000) demonstrated that treatment of m.
smegmatis with inh is sufficient to induce the accumulation of fas-i end-products. the absence of tag accumulation following drug treatment suggests that the fas-i
end-products may be either esterified to molecules different from tags and subsequently stored within lipid bodies
or eventually found to be present as free lipids as proposed by garton et al. (2002). this hypothesis is in line
with early work of gale and mclain (1963) demonstrating
that treatment of m. smegmatis with ethambutol was
accompanied by an increase in the size of lipidic inclusions, presumably due to the accumulation of mycolic acid
precursors, as ethambutol inhibits mycolic acid transfer
into the cell wall (takayama et al., 1979). alternatively,
these inclusions might contain wax esters (consisting of
long-chain fatty alcohols and long-chain  xxxd2154xxx ), representing another class of neutral lipids observed in m.
tuberculosis (wang et al., 1972) and m. smegmatis
(kalscheuer et al., 2003).
minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values of m.
bovis bcg strains overexpressing different enzymes
involved in mycolic acid biosynthesis (the b-ketoacyl acp
synthase kasa, the b-ketoacyl acp reductase maba and
the enoyl acp reductase inha; kremer et al., 2000) were
found to be similar to the wild-type strain (data not shown).
this indicates that overexpression of these fas-ii
© 2005 blackwell publishing ltd, molecular microbiology, 57, 1113–1126

enzymes did not induce thl resistance, thus ruling out
the possibility of these enzymes being in vivo thl targets.
the fact that mycolic acid biosynthesis was only partially
inhibited by thl, even at concentrations at least eightfold
higher than the mic value, suggests that this drug may
have additional targets. interestingly, the use of microarray
experiments to determine the gene expression profile of
m. tuberculosis in response to thl has revealed that
different lipase-encoding genes were upregulated, along
with genes encoding putative transporters and transcriptional regulators (waddell et al., 2004). of particular interest is the induction of rv3855 (ethr) encoding the
transcriptional repressor of the monooxygenase gene
 xxxg2030xxx , involved in the activation of ethionamide, a drug
inhibiting mycolic acid synthesis (baulard et al., 2000;
debarber et al., 2000; vannelli et al., 2002).
kalscheuer and steinbüchel (2003) recently identified
a new family of bifunctional enzymes expressing wax
ester synthase (ws)/acyl-coa:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (dgat) activities, which are involved in the biosynthesis of wax ester and tag. this family is widely
distributed within all members of the mycobacterium
genus and m. tuberculosis h37rv possesses 13 genes
coding ws/dgat-related proteins. these genes were individually expressed in escherichia coli, and it was found
that rv3130c shows the highest dgat activity (daniel
et al., 2004). we therefore investigated whether thl may
inhibit the activity of rv3130c. the corresponding gene
was cloned into a pet28b vector, and the recombinant
protein was expressed in e. coli, purified by affinity chromatography, and tested for dgat activity in the presence
of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol, as described by daniel et al.
(2004). no inhibition of the dgat activity was observed
in the presence of thl, suggesting that dgat are not thl
targets (data not shown).
recent studies have reported a potent antitumour
activity of thl by inhibiting the thioesterase domain of
eukaryotic fas-i, an enzyme strongly linked to tumour
progression (knowles et al., 2004; kridel et al., 2004). the
thioesterase domain allows for the liberation of palmitate
from fas-i after completion of fatty acid biosynthesis. we
demonstrate here that treatment of m. kansasii cultures
with thl was not accompanied by a reduction of fatty
acids originating from the fas-i system, thus excluding
fas-i as a primary target of thl in mycobacteria. careful
inspection by sem of drug-treated mycobacteria revealed
different morphological changes, characterized by the
appearance of small blebs at the surface in the presence
of inh-treated bacteria and small depressions in thltreated cells. this features are consistent with the fact that
inh and thl do not share the same target(s). the possibility that the antimycobacterial activity of thl results from
the combined action of several different targets is particularly interesting, as the presence of multiple targets

1124 l. kremer et al.
would reduce the frequency of appearance of thl resistance in m. tuberculosis. future work may lead to the
development of more potent analogues of thl for the
treatment of mycobacterial infections.
experimental procedures
strains and culture conditions
all mycobacterial strains were grown on middlebrook 7h11
agar plates supplemented with 10%  xxxd2777xxx -albumin-dextrose-catalase (oadc; difco) or under shaking in sauton
medium at 37∞c. m. kansasii phri 901 was isolated from an
hiv-positive patient. thirty-one m. kansasii clinical strains
were isolated primarily from immunocompromised patients in
eight new york city hospitals between march 1999 and april
2000. m. kansasii was cultured from induced or natural sputum, broncho-alveolage, lymphatic fluid and stool.

drug susceptibility testing
the mic of inh and thl was determined by serial 10-fold
dilutions of the mycobacterial cultures on solid middlebrook
7h11 medium containing 10% oadc. after incubation at
37∞c the number of colony-forming units (cfu) were determined, and the mic was defined as the lowest concentration
of the drug resulting in a 99% reduction of cfu.

either inh, thl or cer were added at various concentrations followed by incubation at 37∞c for 8 h. 1 mci  xxxg1167xxx  [1,214
c]-acetate (50–62 mci mmol-1, amersham) was then
added to the cultures followed by further incubation at 37∞c
for 16 h. the 14c-labelled  xxxd1850xxx  lipids were extracted and
analysed as described above. alternatively, to extract fatty
acids and mycolic acids, the 14c-labelled cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 g and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs). the 14c-labelled fames and
mames were then extracted as described previously (kremer
et al., 2002). equal counts were subjected to tlc, developed
in petroleum ether/acetone (95/5; v/v) and exposed overnight
to kodak x-omat film.

purification of tag and newly identified lipid
the  xxxd1850xxx  lipids were fractionated by flash column chromatography at medium pressure using fisher (uk) silica gel 60
(35–70 microns) equilibrated in petroleum ether. both the
tag and the mmdag from m. kansasii were isolated using
2.5% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether and further separated
using a preparative tlc (plastic-backed silica gel 60 f254,
merck, darmstadt, germany). the plates were run several
times in toluene/acetone (99/1; v/v), monitored with ethanolic
rhodamine 6g as a stain and visualized under long wave
(366 nm) uv light. the compounds were then scraped from
plates and extracted using  xxxd2052xxx  and finally evaporated to dryness.

extraction and analysis of mycobacterial  xxxd1850xxx  lipids
saturated mycobacterial pre-cultures were used to inoculate
fresh sauton medium (1/50 dilution) and all cultures were
grown to mid-log phase before the addition of 1 mci  xxxg1167xxx  [1,214
c]-acetate (50–62 mci mmol-1, amersham) or 1 mci  xxxg1167xxx 
[ul-14c]-glycerol (153.5 mci mmol-1, sigma) for 16–24 h. the
non-polar fraction was separated from the polar fraction
according to dobson et al. (1985). the [1,2-14c]-acetatelabelled  xxxd1850xxx  lipids were extracted by adding 2 ml of ch3oh/
0.3% nacl (100/10; v/v) and 2 ml of petroleum ether to the
cell pellet followed by stirring for 30 min. after centrifugation,
the upper petroleum ether layer was removed, and 2 ml of
petroleum ether was added to the lower phase, and the
process was repeated once. the combined petroleum ether
extracts were then evaporated under nitrogen to yield  xxxd1850xxx 
lipids that were resuspended in ch2cl2 and analysed by 2dtlc using silica gel plates (5735 silica gel 60f254; merck,
darmstadt, germany), as reported earlier (besra, 1998). for
the first dimension, three developments of petroleum ether/
ethyl acetate (98/2; v/v) were used and for the second dimension, petroleum ether/acetone (98/2; v/v) was used. tag, as
well as the newly identified  xxxd1850xxx  lipid were separated by
either 1d-tlc using toluene/acetone (99/1; v/v) or 2d-tlc
using petroleum ether/acetone (95/5; v/v) in the first dimension and toluene/acetone (99/1; v/v) in the second dimension.
tlcs were exposed to a kodak x-omat film for 24 h.

h-nmr spectra for the purified samples dissolved in cdcl3
were obtained on a bruker 300 mhz instrument. the intact
tag and the novel lipid were analysed using es/ms. the
measurements were carried out in the positive ion mode on
a triple quadropole lct instrument (micromass, altrincham,
uk) fitted with an atmospheric pressure electrospray source.
the samples were directly injected using a rheodyne injector
(rheodyne europe gmbh, bensheim, germany) with methanol as the mobile phase. the machine was run at a flow
rate of 200 ml min-1 with the cone voltage at 35 v and the
spraying needle voltage set at 3 kv. the scan rate was 1 s,
and the mass range was from 200 to 2000.
 xxxd2154xxx  were released from the tag and the mmdag
as fames. briefly, 2 mg of sample were dried under reduced
pressure, then resuspended in anhydrous toluene and again
dried under reduced pressure. the samples were then resuspended in 3 ml of anhydrous dichloromethane/sodium methoxide (10/1; v/v) and left overnight at room temperature. the
resulting solution was mixed for 30 min with 1 g of a cation
exchange resin (amberlite cg-50, sigma), filtered, dried
under reduced pressure and resuspended in chcl 3/h2o (1/
1; v/v). the fames were recovered in the chcl3 extract
following centrifugation, dried and analysed by gc and gc/
ms.
gas chromatography (gc) analysis was performed using
a thermoquest trace gc 2000 equipped with a flame ionization detector. the samples were separated using a temperature programme as follows. the injector temperature was set
at 50∞c, held for 1 min and then increased to 110∞c at

20∞c min-1. the oven was held at 110∞c, then ramped to
290∞c at 8∞c min-1 and held for 5 min to ensure that all
products had eluted from the column. gc/ms analysis was
performed on a thermoquest trace gc coupled to a finnigan
polaris mass spectroscopy unit (energy, 70 ev) working in
the positive electron impact mode, and the samples were
separated as described above. all data were collected and
analysed using the xcaliber (v. 1.2) software.

processing of bacteria for em
after growth of m. kansasii phri 901 in sauton medium to
mid-log phase, inh (5 mg  xxxg1167xxx ) or thl (40 mg  xxxg1167xxx ) was
added, and the culture continued for 24 h. the bacteria were
then fixed for 2 h at room temperature with 2.5% glutaraldehyde (sigma) in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (ph 7.2), 5 mm
cacl2 and 5 mm mgcl2, washed twice with cacodylate buffer
and post-fixed overnight at room temperature with 1% oso4
in the same buffer. following concentration in 2% agar in the
same buffer and treatment for 1 h at room temperature with
1% uranyl acetate in  xxxd285xxx  buffer, the bacteria were then
dehydrated in a graded series of acetone and embedded in
spurr resin. thin sections were stained with reynold’s lead
citrate. to stabilize and better visualize the lipids within the
inclusions, 0.1% malachite green was added to some of the
samples during the aldehyde fixation and osmium post-fixation steps according to pourcho et al. (1978).
