abstract
in neuroendocrinology, it is believed that steroid hormones
are synthesized in the gonads and/or adrenal glands, and
reach the brain via the blood circulation. in contrast to this
view, we are in progress of demonstrating that estrogens
and androgens are also synthesized locally by cytochrome
p450s in the hippocampus, and that these steroids act rapidly to modulate neuronal synaptic plasticity. we demonstrated that estrogens were locally synthesized in the adult
hippocampal neurons. in the pathway of steroidogenesis,
cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone (by  xxxg570xxx ), dehydroepiandrosterone [by p450(17)], androstenediol (by
17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 17-hsd), testosterone (by 3-hsd) and finally to estradiol (by p450arom) and
dihydrotestosterone (by 5-reductase). the basal concen-

tration of estradiol in the hippocampus was approximately
1 nm, which was greater than that in blood plasma. significant expression of mrna for  xxxg570xxx , p450(17), p450arom,
17-hsd, 3-hsd and 5-reductase was demonstrated by
rt-pcr. their mrna levels in the hippocampus were 1/200–
1/5,000 of those in the endocrine organs. localization of
p450(17) and p450arom was observed in synapses in addition to endoplasmic reticulum of principal neurons using immunoelectron microscopy. different from slow action of gonadal estradiol which reaches the brain via the blood
circulation, hippocampal neuron-derived estradiol may act
locally and rapidly within the neurons. for example, 1 nm
17-estradiol rapidly enhanced the long-term depression
(ltd) not only in ca1 but also in ca3 and dentate gyrus. the
density of thin spines was selectively increased within 2 h
upon application of 1 nm estradiol in ca1 pyramidal neurons.
only er agonist propyl- xxxd3045xxx -trinyl-phenol induced the
same enhancing effect as estradiol on both ltd and spinogenesis in the ca1. er agonist hydroxyphenyl-propionitrile
suppressed ltd and did not affect spinogenesis. localization of  xxxg730xxx  er  in spines in addition to nuclei
of principal neurons implies that synaptic er can drive rapid modulation of synaptic plasticity by endogenous estradiol.

in recent years, increasing evidence has accumulated
to support the local endogenous synthesis of estrogens
and androgens in the mammalian brain, such as the hippocampus [1–5]. in 1980s, baulieu and co-workers have
proposed a neurosteroid hypothesis, suggesting that
pregnenolone (preg), progesterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea) may be endogenously synthesized
in the brain due to the finding that preg and dhea has
been found in the mammalian brain at concentrations
greater than that in plasma [6, 7]. because the concentration of preg and dhea does not decrease after adrenalectomy and castration, many experiments have been performed with the aim of demonstrating the de novo synthesis of dhea within the brain [6, 8].
direct demonstration of steroidogenesis in the mammalian brain had, however, long been unsuccessful, due
to the extremely low levels of steroidogenic proteins in the
brain [9]. in particular, sex steroids had not been considered to be brain-derived steroids, and rather thought to
reach the brain exclusively via blood circulation [10].
this belief is supported by many reports suggesting the
absence of cytochrome p450(17) (dhea synthase) in
adult mammalian brain [11, 12] and also by the observation of the complete disappearance of testosterone in the
brain within 1 day after castration [10]. the hippocampus is a center of learning and memory processes, and is
known to be a target for the neuromodulatory actions of
sex hormones produced in the gonads. estrogens and androgens have specific contributions to rapid action on the
synaptic plasticity as neuromodulators. as both estradiol
and testosterone may reach the brain via blood circulation after crossing the blood brain barrier, extensive studies have been performed to investigate their role in modulating hippocampal plasticity and function [13–18].
because of the extremely low level of expression of
p450s and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (hsds) in the
hippocampus, much lower than 1/1,000 of their levels in
endocrine organs, many scientists had not seriously considered that hippocampal steroidogenesis plays an essential role in the hippocampal function. in order to describe
biological significance of brain steroids, it is essential to
improve the sensitivity of measurements by nearly 1,000fold for immunostaining, western blot, rt-pcr as well as
purified steroid detection. here, we describe recent progress in studies on local synthesis of estrogens and androgens in the hippocampus. we also describe the rapid action of estradiol on synaptic plasticity, which is a candidate essential role of endogenously synthesized estradiol.

steroid synthesis systems in the adult rat
hippocampus

expression of transcripts for steroidogenic enzymes
highly sensitive molecular biology investigations are
necessary for determination of the presence of steroidogenic enzymes, because of the very low level of expression
of the mrnas in the cerebrum and cerebellum [9].
collectively from many studies, the relative level of
mrna expressed in the hippocampus has been suggested to be lowest for cytochrome  xxxg570xxx  and 3-hsd, and
highest for steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (star)
and 5-reductase, with that of p450arom expressed at an
intermediate level (table 1).
the concentration of  xxxg570xxx  mrna expressed in the
brain is reported to be only 10 –4–10 –5 of that in the adrenal gland [12, 19]. our analysis showed approximately
1/50,000 for the  xxxg570xxx  level in the adult hippocampus
as compared with that in the adrenal gland (table 1). as a
result, the presence of  xxxg570xxx  mrna could be demonstrated only by the rt-pcr method. the ribonuclease
(rnase) protection assay for  xxxg570xxx  in the hippocampus, which was performed using a 32p-labelled rat  xxxg570xxx 
antisense riboprobe, however, yielded no detectable specific hybridization signals [20]. on the other hand, because star is most abundant, not only the pcr amplification but also the rnase protection assay demonstrated
the presence of star transcripts with an expression level
of approximately 1/200 of the level in the adrenal gland
[20, 21].

introduction

local neurosteroid production in the
hippocampus

cytes from embryonic and neonatal brains [7, 23, 24, 28].
although similar levels of p450(17) mrna had been
reported to be expressed in both astrocytes and neurons
in primary cell cultures from the brains of neonatal rats,
a much lower metabolic activity had been observed in
neurons than astrocytes for the conversion of preg to
dhea [23, 24].
these investigations are available on primary glial cell
cultures which are easily prepared from embryonic and
neonatal brains. however, information regarding the
biosynthesis system of neurosteroids in ‘adult’ rat brain
is not directly available from these cell culture studies.
neuronal localization of enzymes investigated with
immunostaining
the role of neurons in steroid synthesis had not yet
been clearly determined in the mammalian brain, although some reports suggested the expression of several
steroidogenic enzymes in nonmammalian brains [29]
and rat brain neurons [30, 31]. we overcame many difficulties of nonspecific immunostaining by using affinity
column-purified antibodies (instead of using nonpurified antisera) with a slightly higher triton x-100 concentration (0.5%) in order to obtain a good penetration of
igg, as well as using fresh frozen slices of hippocampus
(instead of using paraffin sections) from adult male
rats. a significant localization of cytochromes  xxxg570xxx 
( xxxg570xxx ), p450(17) (cyp17a) and p450arom ( xxxg574xxx )
was observed in pyramidal neurons in the ca1–ca3 regions, as well as in granule cells in the dg, by means of
the immunohistochemical staining of hippocampal slices (fig. 1) [1–3, 32]. the co-localization of immunoreactivity against p450s and neun (marker protein of neuronal nuclei) confirmed the presence of p450s in these neurons [1–3]. star was co-localized with p450s [1, 21].
these results imply that pyramidal neurons and granule
cells are equipped with complete steroidogenic systems
which catalyze the conversion of cholesterol to preg,
dhea, testosterone and estradiol.
an immunoelectron microscopic analysis using
postembedding immunogold method was performed in
order to determine the intraneuronal localization of
p450(17) in the hippocampal neurons of adult male rats.
surprisingly, we observed that both p450(17) and
p450arom were localized not only in the endoplasmic reticulum but also in the presynaptic region as well as the
postsynaptic region of pyramidal neurons in the ca1–
ca3 regions and of granule neurons in the dg (fig. 1).
these results suggest a possibility of ‘synaptocrine’ mechanisms of synthesis of estrogens and androgens, in addineuroendocrinology 2006;84:255–263

concerning p450(17), many attempts to demonstrate
the immunohistochemical reactivity in the rat brain had
been unsuccessful for almost two decades [11]. the
mrnas for p450(17) had not been detected in adult rat
brain by either rnase protection assays or rt-pcr [12].
the expression of the mrna for p450(17) had been reported by many laboratories as only transient, occurring
during rat embryonic and neonatal development [22–24].
we overcame this difficulty by carefully choosing the sequence of primer pairs which have high specificity by
minimizing gibbs free energy upon recombination of a
3-primer with cdna, using computer calculation [3]. in
the hippocampal tissues from adult male rats aged 3
months, we observed the p450(17) transcripts expressed
approximately 1/300 [3], when compared with those expressed in the testis.
the role of p450arom ( xxxg574xxx ) in the hippocampus had also not been well elucidated, primarily
because many studies had indicated the absence of
p450arom in the adult rat and mouse hippocampus. the
significant expression of mrna for p450arom in the pyramidal and granule neurons of the adult rat hippocampus, however, has recently been demonstrated using in
situ hybridization [25]. the level of the mrna expression
in the adult mouse hippocampus was approximately half
of that in neonatal stages [26]. we observed that the
p450arom transcripts expressed approximately 1/300 [3],
as compared with those expressed in the ovary by using
carefully designed primer pairs for rt-pcr.
the presence of mrnas for 17-hsd type 1 and 3 has
been demonstrated in the human and rat hippocampus
[27]. we investigated the expression level of mrna transcripts for 17-hsd (types 1–4) using carefully designed
primer pairs in the hippocampus from adult male rats.
the mrna level of 17-hsd transcripts observed was
approximately 1/200, relative to the level in the ovary for
17-hsd (type 1), 1/300, relative to the level in the testis
for 17-hsd (type 3), respectively [3].
the localization in neurons of several steroidogenic
proteins has been demonstrated by means of in situ hybridization. for example, mrnas for both star and 3hsd mrna (10 –2 for star and 10 –3 for 3-hsd of the
levels in the adrenal gland) have been observed to be localized along the pyramidal cell layer in the ca1–ca3
regions and the granule cell layer in the dentate gyrus
(dg) of rats [20] and mice [21].
glial cells have been considered to play an important
role in steroidogenesis, as many reports have indicated
the presence of mrna for  xxxg570xxx , p450(17) 3-hsd,
and 17-hsd in cultures of astrocytes and oligodendro-

tion to classical endocrine mechanisms in which sex steroids reach the brain via blood circulation.
the existence of these steroidogenic proteins was confirmed by western immunoblot analyses. a single protein band was observed for each of these p450s [1–3].
the resulting molecular weights obtained for  xxxg570xxx ,
p450(17) and p450arom were nearly identical to those
obtained from peripheral steroidogenic organs. the relative levels of these p450s in the hippocampus were approximately 1/500 ( xxxg570xxx ) and 1/300 [p450(17) and
p450arom] of that in the testis [ xxxg570xxx  and p450(17)]
and the ovary (p450arom), respectively.
for decades, neurosteroidogenesis had been extensively studied in glial cells. from our observation in adult
hippocampus, the distributions of astroglial cells and oligodendroglial cells displayed very different patterns from
those characteristics of the cells containing  xxxg570xxx ,
p450(17) and p450arom [1, 3]. this indicates that the
majority of p450-containing cells are neither astroglial
cells nor oligodendroglial cells.

synthesis of estrogens and androgens in the
hippocampus

a direct demonstration of the neuronal synthesis of
dhea in adult mammals was for the first time reported
by our group [2, 3]. it had been assumed that dhea and
the sex steroids are supplied to the hypothalamus, via the
blood circulation, where they are converted to estradiol
by p450arom [7, 10]. the absence of p450(17) activity in

the brain of adult mammals has been reported in a number of studies [10, 11, 29, 33]. incubations of [3h]-preg
with brain slices, homogenates and microsomes, primary
cultures of mixed glial cells, or astrocytes and neurons
from rat and mouse embryos had failed to produce a radioactive metabolite [3h]-dhea [10].
we challenged to demonstrate the synthesis of dhea,
testosterone and estradiol in the hippocampal slices by
means of hplc analysis [2, 3]. the purification of neurosteroids from very fatty brain tissues required the application of a set of sophisticated methods, which included
purification with organic solvent, column chromatography, and hplc [1, 3, 34]. the significant conversion from
[3h]-preg to [3h]-dhea, from [3h]-dhea to [3h]-androstenediol, [3h]-testosterone and [3h]-estradiol was
observed after incubation with the slices for 5 h (fig. 2)
[3]. the conversion from [3h]-testosterone to [3h]-estradiol and [3h]-dihydrotestosterone was also demonstrated. these activities were abolished by the application of
specific inhibitors of cytochrome p450s. interestingly,
[3h]-estradiol was rather stably present and not significantly converted to other steroid metabolites. on the other hand, dihydrotestosterone was rapidly converted to
3,5- xxxd175xxx .
we determined the concentration of dhea and estradiol as well as preg in the acute hippocampal slices from
adult male rats by means of ria or mass spectroscopy
(lc/ms/ms) after careful purification of steroids with
hplc. the basal concentrations of preg, dhea and
estradiol in the male rat hippocampus were approximately 18, 0.3 and 0.6 nm, which were 6–10 times greater than

action as local mediators. the concentration of estradiol
detected in the hippocampus is about 0.6 nm (basal) and
1.3 nm after the nmda stimulation, respectively. the local concentration of estradiol immediately after the synthesis in the pyramidal neurons is likely to be approximately tenfold higher than the bulk concentration of
1.3 nm, due to the relatively small volume of the p450-immunoreactive cells in the total hippocampus. these considerations suggest that the local concentration of estradiol could be as high as 1–10 nm. these levels are sufficient to allow estradiol to act as a local mediator that
modulates synaptic transmission [13, 15, 17, 40, 41]. functional differences between blood-derived estradiol (reproductive modulator) and brain-synthesized estradiol
(neuronal modulator) may be due to the time-dependence of their levels. the brain is filled with a low concentration of blood-derived estradiol whose level changes
depending on the circadian rhythm, while endogenous
synthesis of estradiol is a transient event occurring mainly during synaptic transmission which drives ca2+ influx
[3].

local neurosteroid production in the
hippocampus

evidence is emerging that 17-estradiol exerts a rapid
influence (0.5–1 h) on the synaptic transmission of adult
rat hippocampal neurons, as demonstrated by means of
electrophysiology [15, 17, 40–42]. in case of the enhancement of long-term potentiation (ltp) by 1–10 nm estradiol in ca1 pyramidal neurons, an immediate increase
by approximately 20% has been observed upon the onset
of estradiol perfusion in the initial slope of the excitatory
postsynaptic potential (epsp), which has been attendant
upon a further approximately 130% increase upon highfrequency tetanic stimulation of schaffer collaterals [13,
17]. however, it should be noted that if we subtract the
20% immediate increase in epsp slope upon the onset of
estradiol perfusion before the tetanic stimulation, the enhancement of ltp by estradiol is not significant. in other
words, the magnitude of pure tetanic stimulation-induced ltp is nearly the same in the presence and in the
absence of estradiol.
on the other hand, we demonstrated, for the first time,
a significant rapid enhancement of the long-term depression (ltd) by 1–10 nm 17-estradiol perfusion in adult
male rat hippocampal ca1, ca3 and dg (fig. 1) [43]. recordings were performed using novel 64 multielectrodes
(med64, panasonic, japan) particularly arranged to
stimulate the schaffer collaterals in the stratum radiatum

modulation of synaptic plasticity by estrogens

those typical of plasma [1–3]. to demonstrate the rapid
net production of neurosteroids upon synaptic stimulation, the nmda-induced production of preg and estradiol was investigated in hippocampal slices [1, 3]. upon
stimulation with nmda for 30 min, the hippocampal
level of preg and estradiol increased to approximately
twofold of the basal levels. this implies that the nmdainduced ca2+ influx drives net production of preg and
estradiol. estradiol synthesis has also been demonstrated
in cultured hippocampal slices in the absence and presence of letrozole, an inhibitor of p450arom. after 4 days
of treatment with letrozole, the amount of estradiol released into the medium was significantly decreased [5].
interestingly, preg sulfate and dhea sulfate have
been reported to be absent in the rat brain as measured
by direct mass spectroscopic analysis, although  xxxd614xxx  is present [35–37]. in many previous publications, preg sulfate or dhea sulfate has been determined indirectly, i.e. by measuring preg or dhea after
solvolysis of water-soluble fractions which may contain
some preg derivatives different from sulfated steroids
[1, 6, 7, 35, 37]. because numerous publications report
that sulfated steroids are very effective for neuromodulation, careful considerations should be made [10, 38, 39].
it is necessary to consider whether the local concentration of brain neurosteroids is sufficiently high to allow

of ca1, the recurrent collateral fibers in the stratum radiatum of ca3, and the medial perforant pathways in the
molecular layer of dg. ltd was induced pharmacologically by the transient application (3 min) of nmda. this
ltd was induced by the activation of phosphatase due to
a moderate ca2+ influx through nmda receptors [44].
the plateau epsp amplitude at 60 min after the nmda
application was 80.4% (ca1), 88.8% (ca3) and 95.1%
(dg). a 30-min preperfusion of 10 nm estradiol significantly enhanced ltd resulting in the residual epsp am-

plitude at 60 min of 59.7% (ca1), 79.1% (ca3) and 92.2%
(dg) (fig. 3) [43]. investigations using specific estrogen
agonists indicated that the contribution of er (but not
er) was essential to these estradiol effects. propyl- xxxd3045xxx -trinyl-phenol (er agonist) [45] at 100 nm exhibited a significant ltd enhancement in ca1, while hydroxyphenyl-propionitrile (dpn, er agonist) did induce a suppression of ltd in ca1, implying that the
contribution of er was opposite to that of er in the
estradiol effect on ltd.

we also demonstrated that dendritic spines were rapidly modulated by estradiol application, using single
spine analysis of lucifer yellow-injected neurons in adult
male hippocampal slices [43, 46]. following a 2-hour
treatment with estradiol in the stratum radiatum of the
ca1 region, the treated dendrites have significantly more
spines at 1 nm estradiol (1.31 spines/m) than dendrites
at 0 nm estradiol (0.85 spines/m) [43]. propyl-pyrazoletrinyl-phenol at 100 nm induced a significant enhancement of the spine density to 1.20 spines/m. however,
dpn at 100 nm increased the spine density only slightly
(0.95 spines/m). blocking of er by 1 m  xxxd2165xxx ,780
and of nmda receptors by mk-801 completely suppressed the enhancing effect of estradiol on the spine
density. blocking of phosphorylation of map kinase by
50 m  xxxd1169xxx  completely prevented the estradiol-induced spinogenesis. the morphological changes in ca1
spines induced by 2-hour estradiol treatments were also
assessed. in control slices (0 nm estradiol), the relative
population of spines was approximately 24% for mushroom spine, 62% for thin spine, 1% for filopodium, and
13% for stubby spine. upon 1 nm estradiol treatment, the
density of thin spine was selectively increased, from 0.57
spines/m to 0.97 spines/m, while the density of mushroom and stubby was not significantly altered. filopodium was increased from almost null (0.01 spines/m) to
0.11 spines/m. interestingly, in ca3 pyramidal neurons, the total density of thorns of thorny excrescences
(spine-like postsynaptic structures in ca3), having contacts with mossy fiber terminals originated from granule

cells, decreased dramatically to approximately 70% upon
2-hour treatments with 1 nm estradiol [46]. these results
imply that the spine density is not always increased by the
estradiol treatments and that the estradiol-induced spinogenesis is highly region specific and heterogeneous.
the rapid effect of estrogens has also been observed in
vivo. maclusky et al. [47] have demonstrated that the estradiol (60 g/kg) has increased the spine-synapse density due to synaptic rearrangements in ovariectomized
rats after 30 min using electron micrographic analysis.
over decades, the delayed genomic effects (1–4 days)
of estradiol on synaptic plasticity have been extensively
investigated. for example, supplement of estrogens in
ovariectomized female rats [47–50] increases the density
of spines in the stratum radiatum of ca1 pyramidal neurons, resulting in recovery of spines to the level of wild
rat. in vitro investigations have also shown that spine
density is increased following several days’ treatment of
cultured hippocampal slices with exogenous estradiol
[18, 51]. the contribution of endogenous estradiol is reported by kretz et al. [5] who have demonstrated that the
suppression of endogenous estradiol synthesis by letrozole treatments for 4 days has significantly decreased the
spine density in the stratum radiatum of the ca1 region
in cultured slices.
what is a receptor of estradiol for its rapid action (0.5–
2 h) in the hippocampus? putative membrane estrogen
receptors for rapid estradiol action has been poorly understood. after several years of careful investigations, we
successfully identified the membrane  xxxg730xxx

fig. 4. schematic illustration of the synaptic synthesis of neurosteroids, and the
modulation of the synaptic transmission
of neurons by neurosteroids. ampa type
glutamate receptors are omitted for clarity.
star, pbr and  xxxg570xxx  are present in the
mitochondria. p450(17), 3-hsd, 17hsd and p450arom are localized in the
membranes in the synaptic compartment.
the site of rapid action for estradiol is synaptic er. the site of delayed action for
estradiol is er present in the cytoplasm
and nuclei.

er localized in the spines of hippocampal pyramidal
and granule neurons by means of immunoelectron microscopic analysis as well as western blot analysis using
novel purified anti-er antibody rc-19 [46]. a postembedding immunogold electron microscopic analysis
demonstrated the subcellular localization of er in the
glutamatergic neurons in ca1, ca3 and dg. er was
localized not only in the nuclei but also in both the dendritic spines and axon terminals of principal neurons
(fig. 1). western blot of purified postsynaptic density
fractions demonstrated a single band of er (67 kda)
together with a map kinase band. because the estradiolinduced modulation of ltd and spine morphology appeared so rapidly in the time range of 1–2 h, the synaptic
er observed in postsynaptic density fractions and postsynaptic compartment probably plays an essential role in
driving rapid processes. it should be noted that specific
binding of purified rc-19 antibody to real er (67 kda)
in the hippocampus was qualified using erko mice
and maldi-tof mass-spectrometric analysis of rc-19reacted proteins [43]. these analyses were essential, because we found that nonpurified mc-20 antisera, frequently used in previous investigations, often reacted
with 62 kda unknown proteins in the brain and did not

significantly react with real er (67 kda). therefore,
staining patterns with nonpurified antisera may not show
real er distribution.
hypothetical model of synaptocrinology

based on experimental observations, we illustrate in
figure 4 a hypothetical model for the synaptic synthesis
of brain steroid and the modulation of the synaptic transmission of neurons by brain steroid. brain steroid synthesis proceeds in the following manner. first, glutamate release from the presynapse induces a ca2+ influx through
the nmda receptors. the ca2+ influx drives star or  xxxg2342xxx  (pbr) [52] to transport
cholesterol into the mitochondria, where  xxxg570xxx  converts cholesterol to preg. after reaching the endoplasmic reticulum, the conversion of ‘preg ] dhea ] androstenediol ] testosterone ] estradiol, or testosterone
] dihydrotestosterone’ is performed by p450(17), 3hsd, 17-hsd, p450arom and 5-reductase. produced
estradiol binds to synaptic er and drives signaling
pathway including map kinase, etc., finally resulting in
modulation of ampa receptors or nmda receptors.
