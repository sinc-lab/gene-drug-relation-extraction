abstract: while none of the currently available treatment options for endometriosis pain resolved the
underlying disease process, there are growing numbers of medical alternatives available. medical
options include the gnrh agonists and antagonists. review of these treatments in the management of
endometriosis pain and the insight often to the etiology of endometriosis are presented for discussion.

basic science research into the mechanism of the development of endometriosis, its persistence, and resulting pain
has begun to improve our understanding of how various
therapeutic options work. while none of the available treatments resolves the underlying disease process, there are a
growing number of alternatives.1–3 one of the more recent
classes of medical options includes the  xxxg930xxx  (gnrh) agonist and antagonists. while at
present this class of medical options is the most expensive
and complex in its implementation, it proves invaluable in
terms of offering an aggressive, successful alternative for
many patients. furthermore, these agents may act directly
on endometrial lesions in a therapeutic manner. this discussion will be oriented toward endometriosis pain management, but many of the medical manipulations may be therapeutic for infertility treatment as well if only by preventing
the need for aggressive or emergency surgical management
of endometriosis, especially in young women.
pain symptoms and american society of reproductive
medicine (asrm) staging4 or number of endometrial
lesions have long been known to show no specific correlation.5,6 yet, up to 60% of women with dysmenorrhea

metriosis.7 thus assessing improvement on an objective
scale by second-look laparoscopy may not be as relevant
as the clinical measure of pain relief, although it has been
used in double-blind studies.8 –13 hormonal suppressive
treatment, although effective for pain management, has
no specific action on endometriomas or pelvic adhesions.
although the initiation of gnrh agonist therapy may
dictate laparoscopic documentation of endometriosis,14 second-look laparoscopy is not a necessary part of clinical
practice. in particular, because of the severity of side effects
with gnrh agonists, specific treatment goals, as related to
quality of life are important to maximize individual therapeutic success. gnrh agonist or antagonist treatment is
usually not considered a first line option for treatment of
endometriosis pain.14 cost, as well as side-effect profile,
dictates the use of progestins, whether by oral, intramuscular, or intrauterine device use, or oral contraceptives for
ovarian suppression as the first-line therapy. however, according to the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists committee opinion, empiric gnrh agonist
treatment may be offered to patients older than 18 years. if
pain subsides, then a clinical diagnosis of endometriosis can
be made.14
gnrh agonists are potent down-regulators of pituitary
function, increasing initial release then depletion of gonadotropin follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone.15 with regard to endometriosis, they are believed to

function by creating an estrogen-deficient state by about 2
weeks after initiation of therapy.16 there is growing scientific evidence that gnrh agonists may have direct action on
ovarian steroidogenesis independent of their action on the
pituitary and direct effects on endometrial implant growth.
recent laboratory data with biopsy specimens of ectopic
endometrium from 16 women with untreated endometriosis
confirmed direct action of gnrh agonists on ectopic endometrial cells.17,18 the gnrh agonist ( xxxd2463xxx )–
exposed cells showed increased apoptosis with decreasing
release of promitogenic cytokines such as  xxxg1170xxx 
(il-1␤) and  xxxg2413xxx  (vegf),
both believed to be related to the growth of endometriosis.
these effects were reversed by the addition of antide, a
gnrh antagonist. the vegf family of angiogenic molecules is involved in general angiogenesis.
recent data suggest that vegf may be involved in
maintenance of endometriosis.19,20 immunologic factors
working through il-1 may act as growth factors, as well as
protect cells from apoptotic demise. both have been measured as elevated in the peritoneal fluid of women with
endometriosis.21 furthermore, gnrh receptors have been
identified in ectopic endometrium,22 suggesting that gnrh
may be a direct regulator of endometriosis growth. iwabe et
al23 demonstrated changes in interleukin-6 (il-6) concentration in patients with ovarian endometriomas after laparoscopic removal in 13 patients, as well as with gnrh
agonist ( xxxd387xxx ) before surgical treatment in 9 patients.
matsuzaki et al24 found  xxxg730xxx  alpha (era)
mrna levels decreased in endometriomas after long-term
gnrh agonist treatment but not  xxxg731xxx  (er ␤) mrna
levels.24 others have demonstrated localized changes secondary to gnrh agonist therapy whether in enzyme levels25 or apoptosis.26 these actions of gnrh would explain
in part the regression of endometrial lesions seen after
gnrh agonist therapy17 as related to more than just the
induced hypoestrogenic state.
 xxxg930xxx  (gnrh) agonist therapy also influences eutopic endometrium function in patients with endometriosis either as a consequence of the
induced hypoestrogenic state27 or by direct action such as
demonstrated by wang et al.28 the studies imply an autocrine-paracrine action on local gnrh receptors within endometrium or ectopic endometrial tissue.
the initial action of gnrh agonists is to cause a flare of
pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, which may result in an exacerbation of endometriosis
pain caused by the ovarian stimulation. within 2 weeks, the
release of pituitary gonadotropins ceases, and an estrogendeficient state is obtained because of the lack of continued
ovarian stimulation.29 concern regarding this initial pain
exacerbation dictates beginning treatment in the luteal phase
of the cycle when the ovary is less primed for stimulation.
the importance of this initial flare effect of gnrh agonists has been evaluated. short-term endometriosis response

was monitored. miller30 found an increase in endometriosisassociated pain at 2 and 4 weeks when the gnrh agonist
was given in the early follicular phase. gelety et al31 confirmed an exaggeration in the flare effect when the agonist
was given in the early follicular phase as opposed to the late
follicular phase. furthermore, meldrum et al32 demonstrated that pituitary suppression was achieved more rapidly
when gnrh agonist treatment was begun in the mid luteal
phase. most studies document no increase in pain after the
first month of therapy.33,34
the rapid induction of an estrogen-deficient state as
profound as surgical menopause accounts for most of the
side effects related to gnrh agonist therapy (table 1). up
to 95% of patients experienced menopausal symptoms, the
most common of which are hot flashes and insomnia.35–37
other symptoms less frequently noted include vaginal dryness, mood changes, and headache. lipid changes include a
decrease in hdl and increase in ldl. these symptoms, as
well as the therapeutic effects, occur for the most part
regardless of the gnrh agonist used (tables 1 and 2).
concern regarding bone loss has become the rate-limiting change related to gnrh agonist therapy.14 average
bone loss of 4% to 6% detected after 6 months of gnrh
agonist therapy42– 46 appears to be related to the hypoestrogenic state.47 although most people appear to regain bone
density loss as estrogen levels return to normal with discontinuation of therapy, most authors have suggested a 6-month
limit to gnrh agonist therapy.48 –50 variability related to
the reversibility of bone loss may be due to difference in the
agonist used, the population studied (diet, lifestyle etc.),
patient age (i.e., before attainment of peak bmd), or variability in bone mineral density as suggested by pierce et al51
and matsuo.52
the concept of add-back therapy with gnrh agonist
treatment was initiated to help temper some of the hypoestrogenic side effects, particularly bone loss. the “estrogen threshold hypothesis” of barbieri53 suggested that
there was a specific estrogen threshold below which endometriosis was not stimulated, but hot flashes and bone loss
were controlled. titration of the specific hypoestrogenic
level, while possible with nasal gnrh agonist (personal

suggested as part of appropriate follow-up to long-term gnrh

studies have been done with all of the different gnrh
agonists available on the market. although the various formulations are delivered by different routes of administration
and different dosages, ovarian suppression is produced by
all with little difference in side effects or efficacy.1,3,41,60

with  xxxd1806xxx , the previous gold standard, or placebo, have
been significant. when compared with placebo, leuprolide
acetate was highly effective in a 6-month trial.35 studies
comparing various gnrh agonists with  xxxd1806xxx , all have
shown equivalent pain relief.8 –12,38-41,60

gnrh antagonists
 xxxg930xxx  (gnrh) antagonists
are now used routinely as part of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation protocols for assisted reproduction and fertility
treatments.  xxxg930xxx  (gnrh) antagonists work by competitive blocking of pituitary gnrh
receptors.3,61 their action onset is immediate, time related,
and reversible. there is no initial flare of gonadotropins
either before or after the onset of action. but unlike gnrh
agonists, gonadotropins are not depleted, although the similar end effect of a hypoestrogenic state is achieved.62
recent laboratory studies comparing the effects of
gnrh agonists with gnrh antagonists on eutopic endometrial cells in women with and without endometriosis showed
no direct effects from the antagonists as opposed to the
agonists that demonstrated increased apoptosis and decreased cytokines.17 interestingly, the addition of a gnrh
antagonist blocked the down-regulation effects of the gnrh
agonist on the eutopic endometrial tissue from both patients
with endometriosis and control subjects, supporting the thesis that direct effects of gnrh agonists in vitro are probably
mediated by local  xxxg931xxx  interaction.
most available clinical forms of gnrh antagonists offer
short-term (daily or third-day) dosing as part of infertility
treatment. while theoretically gnrh antagonists should be
applicable to endometriosis treatment, as yet few studies
have been published. recent work by küpker et al63 used
subcutaneous injections of a gnrh antagonist ( xxxd466xxx )
in 15 patients with pain related to endometriosis. a onceweekly dose of 3 mg over 8 weeks was used. serum estradiol levels ranged around 50 pg/ml during therapy. all
patients were symptom free during the treatment period.
subsequent laparoscopy confirmed regression in 60% of
cases (9/15), with a significant decline in stage of endometriosis from stage iii to stage ii.
on the basis of this, donnez et al64 reported on a dose
finding study for a gnrh antagonist,  xxxd466xxx , given over
a period of 8 weeks in the treatment of endometriosis. sixty
women with laparoscopy-proven endometriosis and moderate to severe symptoms were included in the 8-week trial.
weekly or bi-weekly doses of  xxxd466xxx , 5 mg or 10 mg,
were used. all resulted in a rapid decrease in endometriosis
symptoms by 4 weeks of treatment, and the effect continued
until 16 weeks on the basis of pain and dysmenorrhea
scores. treatment was well tolerated except for one local
injection site irritation. as the authors note, the absence of
a flare effect with treatment initiation allows for dose-free
intervals to be interspersed without risk of exacerbation if

543
retreatment is postponed until symptoms recur. this may
allow for an interesting approach to treatment. development
of gnrh antagonist with long-term action may be of use for
such treatments.
there is recent research regarding a second type of
gnrh, gnrh ii, which occurs throughout peripheral tissues in the female reproductive tract including the placenta,
endometrium, and granulosa cells of the ovary, as well as
the central nervous system. according to studies by morimoto et al,65 levels of gnrh ii mrna were lower in
endometrial and endometriotic tissue of women with endometriosis than in those without endometriosis. since the
effect of gnrh ii is antiproliferative and antiinflammatory,
its decreased presence in patients with endometriosis suggests another deficient protective mechanism leading to
disease development. the addition of gnrh antagonists
(antide) blocked  xxxd2227xxx  and gnrh ii action in this study,
suggesting a specific local effect of gnrh antagonists that
may be therapeutic beyond the blocking of pituitary
 xxxd2227xxx .

conclusion
treatment with a gnrh agonist does provide proven
pain relief in 80% to 90% of women with documented
endometriosis, but medical treatment is suppressive therapy,
not extirpative therapy,66 and pain does recur. although
recent evidence suggests a direct effect of gnrh agonist on
endometriosis lesions, the addition of medical treatment to
conservative surgery pain management has shown extended
relief when used for 6 months or more.66,67
 xxxg930xxx  (gnrh) agonist therapy has been proven efficacious in the treatment of pain
related to endometriosis. the addition of immediate addback therapy, as well as preventing bone loss, appears to
improve compliance and tolerability without sacrificing the
therapeutic aim of pain relief. in this combination, gnrh
agonist therapy deserves consideration as first-line therapy
for proven endometriosis pain relief. further development
of long-acting gnrh antagonists for endometriosis treatment deserves attention because of the immediacy of onset,
ease of reversibility and lack of pain increase (flare) with
utilization.
