abstract the recent success of fty720 ( xxxd2109xxx ,  xxxd2109xxx ®), which has been
approved for the treatment of relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis and is the firstin-class sphingosine-1-phosphate (s1p) receptor modulating drug, has boosted the
interest in further drug development in this area. several selective s1p1 receptormodulating drugs are being investigated in clinical trials for the treatment of diverse
autoimmune disorders.  xxxg639xxx  inhibitors are under development for the
treatment of cancer, aberrant angiogenesis and inflammatory diseases; an inhibitor
of  xxxg1265xxx  with relatively low affinity is being analysed in patients with advanced solid
tumours. while an indirect s1p lyase inhibitor has just failed the proof of concept in
patients with rheumatoid arthritis, s1p lyase is still a promising target for the
treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. another approach is the
development of s1p-scavenging or -clearing agents, including a monoclonal s1p
antibody that has successfully passed phase i clinical trials and will be further
developed for age-related macular degeneration.

1 introduction
the bioactive lipid, sphingosine-1-phosphate (s1p), is a ubiquitous signalling molecule that regulates cell proliferation, migration and cell–cell contacts and thereby
controls essential organ functions. s1p for example regulates immune cell trafficking,
maintenance of the vascular barrier, angiogenesis, regulation of heart rate and many
other functions (chi 2011; maceyka et al. 2012; also see other chapters of this book).
drugs that target the s1p signalling system are under development for the treatment
of autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, aberrant angiogenesis as well as
cancer (huwiler and pfeilschifter 2008; pyne and pyne 2010; edmonds et al. 2011).
established molecular targets within the s1p signalling system include the g-proteincoupled s1p receptors (s1p-gpcr) and the enzymes that catalyse the formation and
degradation of s1p, the sphingosine kinases (sk1,  xxxg1265xxx ) and s1p lyase. the therapeutic potential of these targets and the presently available drugs will be discussed in
this chapter, with a focus on compounds that are in clinical development or have been
tested in animal models with a clear concept for further clinical development.
notably, the s1p-gpcr are important regulators of cell migration during development and in immune and inflammatory responses (chi 2011). these migratory
activities are controlled by concentration gradients of s1p, for example by the
blood-tissue gradient which directs lymphocyte migration from lymphatic tissues
with low s1p concentrations to lymph and blood with high s1p concentrations (hla
et al. 2008). in fact, blocking the sensitivity of lymphocytes for this gradient or
disturbing the gradient by different means are presently the most common
mechanisms of drugs targeting the s1p signalling system.
the s1p signalling system also comprises the transporters that allow inside-out
signalling by s1p and autocrine/paracrine activation of s1p-gpcr. of these enzymes,
the spinster-2 protein recently gained interest because it was shown that it contributes to
the blood-tissue gradient of s1p (fukuhara et al. 2012). thus, the deletion of spinster2 in mice led to a decrease in s1p plasma concentrations and defects in lymphocyte
egress (fukuhara et al. 2012). these effects were traced back to endothelial spinster-2,
confirming the previously suggested important role of the vascular endothelium for
maintenance of the s1p gradient (fukuhara et al. 2012; hla et al. 2008). therefore,
spinster-2 might be a target for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

2 s1p receptor-modulating drugs
there are five high-affinity s1p-gpcr which are widely expressed and regulate a
multitude of functions in a partly overlapping and partly antagonistic manner (chun
et al. 2010). the interest in the development of s1p receptor-modulating drugs has

been initiated by the discovery that fty720, an immunosuppressive drug with a
unique influence on lymphocyte trafficking and homing, interacted with s1pgpcr. the whole area is still strongly influenced by fty720, and therefore,
further drug development primarily focuses on selective functional antagonists at
the s1p1 receptor as immunosuppressive drugs. several compounds have been
synthesized that act as agonists or antagonists at the s1p2/3/4/5 receptors, and they
are used experimentally for studying the functional roles of these receptors. these
rather experimental compounds will not be reviewed here.
fty720 ( xxxd2109xxx ; fig. 1) has recently been approved by fda and emea
for the treatment of relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (see web sites http://
www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction¼search.
drugdetails and http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_gb/document_library/
epar_-_product_information/human/002202/wc500104528.pdf). pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of fty720 as well as the pivotal clinical trials
have been extensively reviewed (see, e.g., brinkmann et al. 2010; cohen and chun
2011; david et al. 2012; pelletier and hafler 2012). fty720 is the prodrug of
fty720-phosphate, which is produced by sphingosine kinases, preferentially by
 xxxg1265xxx , and acts as agonist with nanomolar affinity at the s1p-gpcr, s1p1/3/4/5.
diverse studies have confirmed that fty720’s immunosuppressive action is
based on activation of the s1p1 receptor, which is subsequently internalized and

may be degraded (oo et al. 2007) or induce prolonged signalling (mullershausen
et al. 2009). this removal of the s1p1 receptor from the cell surface, rendering the
cells insensitive to external s1p, can be interpreted as superagonistic activity or
functional antagonism. as a consequence, certain populations of t lymphocytes
(mainly naı̈ve and central memory t cells) as well as b lymphocytes lose their
ability to sense the blood-tissue gradient of s1p and are trapped in lymphatic tissues
(reviewed by brinkmann et al. 2010; cohen and chun 2011). lymphopenia can also
be observed with s1p1 receptor antagonists such as w146 and tasp0277308,
provided the pharmacokinetic properties of the compounds are considered (tarrasón
et al. 2011; fujii et al. 2012). interestingly, other effects of fty720, such as the
s1p1-mediated improvement of the endothelial barrier function, are not mimicked
by s1p1 receptor antagonists, in contrast, they induce a vascular leak (sanna et al.
2006; tarrasón et al. 2011; fujii et al. 2012), suggesting that barrier improvement by
fty720 as agonistic effect may be due to prolonged signalling of the internalized
ligand–receptor complex. repeated administration of fty720 and other s1p1
receptor agonists, on the other hand, may exacerbate vascular leak, as observed in
the mouse model of bleomycin-induced lung injury (shea et al. 2010), indicating
loss of s1p1 on the long term. while the main in vivo activities of fty720 are
probably in large part due to impaired invasion of lymphocytes into inflamed tissues,
the drug may also have direct effects on cells of the central nervous system that
contribute to its clinical effectiveness in multiple sclerosis (for discussion, see
brinkmann et al. 2010; cohen and chun 2011). interestingly, a specific knockout
of s1p1 in astrocytes alleviated the course of experimental autoimmune encephalitis
(eae) in mice and also abrogated the activity of fty720, suggesting that the s1p1
receptor plays an important role in astrocyte pathophysiology during eae as well as
for the activity of fty720 (choi et al. 2011).
presently there are no clinical guidelines for the use of fty720 in multiple
sclerosis (killestein et al. 2011; pelletier and hafler 2012). the most common
serious adverse effects of fty720 are bradycardia and atrioventricular block,
which typically occur during initiation of the therapy and resolve within 24 h
despite continued fty720 treatment (kappos et al. 2010; cohen et al. 2010). the
underlying mechanism is the activation of g-protein-gated inwardly rectifying
potassium (girk) channels in the cardiac conduction system by s1p-gpcr.
notably, there is a report of a severe bradycardia and asystole even 21 h after the
first dose of fty720 (espinosa and berger 2011). furthermore, a case of sudden
death after the first dose of fty720 has been reported in december 2011, and this
case is being further investigated by fda and emea (see web sites http://www.
fda.gov/drugs/drugsafety/ucm284240.htm and http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/
en_gb/document_library/press_release/2012/01/wc500120703.pdf). other side
effects of fty720 include mild infections as a consequence of immunosuppression,
mild increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as a decrease in lung
function probably due to s1p-gpcr modulation, asymptomatic increases in liver
enzymes and macular oedema (kappos et al. 2010; cohen et al. 2010; pelletier and
hafler 2012). fty720 is being further developed for the treatment of primary
progressive multiple sclerosis (table 1).

several s1p receptor-modulating drugs with selectivity for the s1p1 receptor
have been developed and some of them are being tested in clinical trials for the
treatment of multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases (fig. 1 and table 1).
krp-203 is the prodrug of krp-203-phosphate, which induces [ca2+]i increases
via the s1p1 and s1p4 receptors with ec50s of ~1 and ~10 nm, respectively, and
lacks activity at the s1p3 receptor (song et al. 2008). krp-203 induced
lymphopenia in mice and was active in rat organ transplantation, rat autoimmune
myocarditis, chronic colitis in  xxxg1161xxx  deficient mice (reviewed by huwiler
and pfeilschifter 2008) and autoimmune kidney disease in the mrl/lpr mouse
model (wenderfer et al. 2008). krp-203 is being tested in phase ii clinical trials for
ulcerative colitis and subacute lupus erythematosus. auy954 can activate the s1p1
receptor without being phosphorylated. in a gtpgammas binding assay, auy954
activated the s1p1 receptor with an ec50 of ~1 nm, while it activated  xxxg2008xxx  and
s1p3 with ec50s of 340 and 1,200 nm, respectively, and lacked activity at s1p2 and
s1p4 (pan et al. 2006). auy954 induced lymphopenia and prolonged the survival
of cardiac allografts in rats (pan et al. 2006), reduced allergen-induced plasma
leakage in mice (blé et al. 2009) and attenuated paraparesis in a t cell-mediated
autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating disease of the peripheral nervous system
(zhang et al. 2009). act-128800 (ponesimod) stimulated gtpgammas binding with
ec50s of ~6 nm at s1p1, 60 nm at  xxxg2008xxx , 100 nm at s1p3, and ~1,000 nm at s1p4,

244

d. meyer zu heringdorf et al.

while no activity at s1p2 was detectable (piali et al. 2011; bolli et al. 2010). act128800 attenuated the inflammatory responses in the skin of mice with delayedtype hypersensitivity and in rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis (piali et al. 2011).
the drug had a relatively short plasma half-life of ~3 h after a single oral dose in
rats, which corresponded to a relatively rapid reversibility of the lymphopenia
compared to fty720, which has an elimination half-life of 6–9 days and requires
1–2 months for full recovery of the immunological effects (piali et al. 2011). act128800 is being tested in phase ii clinical trials for relapsing–remitting multiple
sclerosis and severe chronic plaque psoriasis. in agreement with the concept that the
 xxxg2008xxx  receptor contributes to the activity of fty720 in multiple sclerosis, baf312,
an s1p1/5 agonist (gergely et al. 2009), is being tested in phase ii clinical trials of
relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis and polymyositis/dermatomyositis. indeed,
in an organ model of de- and remyelination, in which the drugs’ influence on
lymphocyte trafficking is irrelevant, fty720 and baf312, but not the s1p1selective auy954, increased markers of remyelination (jackson et al. 2011). cs0777 is another s1p1 receptor modulator that is being tested in clinical trials. it
again is a prodrug that needs to be phosphorylated, which is interestingly catalysed
by fructosamine-3-kinase and fructosamine-3-kinase-related protein in
erythrocytes (yonesu et al. 2011). cs-0777 has a similar long half-life and slow
reversibility of action as fty720 (moberly et al. 2012). cym-5442 is a highly
selective agonist at the s1p1 receptor and inhibited  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated campresponsive element transcription with an ec50 of ~1 nm (gonzalez-cabrera et al.
2008). this compound was able to activate the s1p1 receptor without binding to the
amino acid residues, r120 and e121 (gonzalez-cabrera et al. 2008), which form
ionic interactions with the phosphate head group of s1p (parrill et al. 2000; hanson
et al. 2012). cym-5442 has a relatively short half-life in plasma (~3 h after oral
application in rats; gonzalez-cabrera et al. 2008), but it strongly accumulates
within the cns (gonzalez-cabrera et al. 2012). in agreement, during once daily
application of cym-5442 in mice, lymphocyte counts recovered within each cycle,
while the s1p1 receptor was downregulated on astrocytes and neurons and eae was
attenuated (gonzalez-cabrera et al. 2012). these observations may support the
hypothesis that the s1p1 receptor on cells within the cns is the major target in
multiple sclerosis, but it may also be the case that a transient lymphopenia is
sufficient for reducing the symptoms of eae.
taken together, the s1p1 receptor modulators differ with regard to s1p receptor
subtype selectivity and pharmacokinetics. both the receptor profile and a potential
organ accumulation will have an impact on the drugs’ clinical activities. the hope
that s1p1 selective compounds will cause less cardiac arrhythmias, because girk
activation is mediated by s1p3 in mice (sanna et al. 2004), has been challenged by
reports showing that highly selective s1p1 agonists can cause bradycardia in
humans (gergely et al. 2009). compounds with shorter elimination half-life and
quicker recovery from immunosuppression than fty720 will have the advantage of
rapid washout in case of side effects. a thorough comparison of the s1p1 receptor
modulators, however, requires more comprehensive data than publicly available.
therefore, access to original preclinical and phase i data is urgently needed.

3  xxxg639xxx  inhibitors
the two isoforms of  xxxg639xxx  are differentially expressed and regulated
(pitson 2011), and initiate diverse cellular responses depending on their subcellular
localization (maceyka et al. 2012). there is substantial evidence that sphingosine
kinase inhibitors might be useful for the treatment of cancer, aberrant angiogenesis
and inflammatory diseases. sk1, in particular, is regarded as a player in tumour cell
growth and survival. in several human cancers, sk1 expression is higher than in
adjacent normal tissue, and high sk1 expression correlates with malignancy and/or
reduced patient survival (reviewed by pyne and pyne 2010).  xxxg1265xxx , in contrast, has
been associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (igarashi et al. 2003; liu et al.
2003). however, observations from knockout mice, in which deletion of a single
sk isoform was compensated for by the other isoform, and studies with  xxxg1265xxx 
inhibitors (see below) have challenged the view that sk1 and  xxxg1265xxx  play antagonistic
roles. sphingosine kinases, with most studies focused on sk1, are furthermore
involved in the regulation of inflammatory processes such as arthritis, colitis,
asthma, and anaphylaxis, they contribute to the regulation of smooth muscle
(vascular and bronchial) contraction, they stimulate angiogenesis and play a role
in ischemia–reperfusion injury (for review, see snider et al. 2010; maceyka et al.
2012). importantly, signalling by sphingosine kinases can either be due to secreted/
exported s1p which acts on s1p-gpcr, a process that is called inside-out signalling, or to interaction of s1p with intracellular targets. intracellular sk1/s1p
signalling for example mediated  xxxg1559xxx  activation downstream of the tnf-alpha
receptor, and nuclear  xxxg1265xxx /s1p signalling inhibited histone deacetylase activity
(reviewed by maceyka et al. 2012). thus, the functional roles of sphingosine
kinases are even more complex than those of the s1p-gpcr.
the first nonlipid sk inhibitors were identified by screening of ~16,000
compounds for inhibition of purified recombinant human sk1 (french et al.
2003). of these compounds, ski-ii (4-[[4-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-thiazolyl]amino]
phenol) was orally active and inhibited the growth of a mammary adenocarcinoma
in a syngeneic mouse model (french et al. 2006). the mode of inhibition was noncompetitive for atp (french et al. 2003). later, it was found that in intact cells,
ski-ii caused an effective degradation of sk1 (ren et al. 2010; loveridge et al.
2010). there is some disagreement whether this occurs through lysosomal (ren
et al. 2010) or proteasomal (loveridge et al. 2010) degradation.
while ski-ii also inhibits the  xxxg1265xxx  isoform (lim et al. 2011), the water-soluble
sphingosine
analog,
sk1-i
((2r,3s,4e)-n-methyl-5-(40 -pentylphenyl)-2aminopent-4-ene-1,3-diol), inhibited specifically sk1 with a ki of ~10 mum, while
it had no influence on  xxxg1265xxx , ceramide kinase, and several protein kinases in a protein
kinase activity screen (paugh et al. 2008). it induced apoptosis in leukaemia cell
lines and in primary blasts from patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia in vitro
(ic50 ~7.5 mum), and inhibited the growth of u937 (human leukemic monocyte
lymphoma) cell xenografts in vivo (paugh et al. 2008). sk1-i furthermore induced
cell death in glioblastoma cell lines and attenuated migration and invasion of these

246

d. meyer zu heringdorf et al.

cells (kapitonov et al. 2009). it also was active against glioblastoma xenografts and
prolonged the survival of nude mice with intracranial glioblastoma cell xenografts
(kapitonov et al. 2009).
it is an irony in the history of sk inhibitor development that primarily sk1 has
been regarded as the target for treatment of cancer, but an  xxxg1265xxx  inhibitor became the
first to be tested in clinical trials. abc294640 (fig. 1) inhibited recombinant  xxxg1265xxx 
with a ki of ~10 mum but had no effect on sk1 up to at least 100 mum (french et al.
2010). its mode of action was competitive to sphingosine. abc294640 was inactive
against 20 different protein kinases at a concentration of 50 mum. in cell lines,
abc294640 inhibited s1p formation with an ic50 of 26 mum and decreased cellular
s1p levels. the compound inhibited the growth of various tumour cell lines in vitro,
reduced migration and disrupted actin microfilament structure, suggesting that it
might be able to reduce tumour metastasis. abc294640 had a good oral bioavailability and tolerability in mice. toxicity was associated with the haematopoietic
system, with slight decreases in red blood cell number and haematocrit (french
et al. 2010). at 35 and 100 mg/kg, abc294640 reduced the growth of a mouse jc
mammary adenocarcinoma cell line growing subcutaneously in immunocompetent
balb/c mice (french et al. 2010). the antitumor activity of abc294640 has
furthermore been shown in diverse xenograft models, including kidney, pancreatic
and hepatocellular carcinoma (beljanski et al. 2011a; beljanski et al. 2011b).
interestingly, abc294640 binds in the antagonist ligand-binding domain of the
 xxxg730xxx  and has antiestrogenic effects, and therefore it has therapeutic
potential for treatment of  xxxg730xxx -positive breast cancer by inhibiting
both sk and oestrogen signalling (antoon et al. 2010). the low affinity to  xxxg1265xxx 
raises the suspicion that abc294640 also has yet (an)other target(s). the drug is
presently being tested in a phase i clinical trial involving patients with advanced
solid tumours (table 1). abc294640 was furthermore active in diverse models of
inflammatory diseases. the compound suppressed dextran sulphate sodiuminduced and trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid-induced colitis in mice (models for
ulcerative colitis and crohn’s disease, respectively), and reduced colitis-driven
colon cancer development in mice (maines et al. 2008, 2010; chumanevich et al.
2010). abc294640 also attenuated collagen- and adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats
(fitzpatrick et al. 2011a), although sk1 sirna reduced and  xxxg1265xxx  sirna
aggravated collagen-induced arthritis in mice (lai et al. 2009), and even was
beneficial in experimental osteoarthritis in rats (fitzpatrick et al. 2011b).
a major problem of the above-described sk inhibitors is their low potency.
recently, the up to now most potent sk inhibitors were identified by in silico
screening with a homology model of sk1 (kennedy et al. 2011). several amidinebased compounds were identified which inhibited sk1 and/or  xxxg1265xxx  in the
submicromolar concentration range (kennedy et al. 2011). compound “1a”
inhibited sk1 with a ki of 0.1 mum and  xxxg1265xxx  with a ki of 1.5 mum and effectively
reduced s1p levels in cultured cells (kharel et al. 2011). “1a” potently inhibited
 xxxg681xxx -stimulated s1p synthesis, erk and akt phosphorylation,
while ~tenfold higher concentrations of “1a” were required to induce cytotoxicity,
caspase-3 and parp cleavage than for the reduction of s1p levels. interestingly,

247

intravenous application of “1a” to mice within 20 min reduced blood s1p levels in
wild type, but not in sk1/ mice, confirming that the drug acts as sk1 inhibitor
in vivo and revealing that there is a rapid turnover of s1p in blood (kharel et al.
2011). these data challenge the hypothesis that sk1 is a target for treatment of
cancer, however, the novel compounds will help to redefine the roles of the two
sphingosine kinases in health and disease.

4 s1p lyase inhibitors
s1p lyase catalyses the irreversible cleavage of the sphingosine backbone, therefore
it is required for the ultimate degradation of sphingolipids (kumar and saba 2009). it
was first reported in 2005 that the blood-tissue-gradient of s1p is dependent on the
enzymatic activity of s1p lyase. this was discovered because the component of
caramel colour iii, 2-acetyl-4-tetrahydroxybutylimidazole (thi; fig. 1), which was
known to induce lymphopenia, elevated s1p concentrations in lymphoid tissues by
inhibiting s1p lyase activity (schwab et al. 2005). the high concentrations of s1pinduced internalization of the s1p1 receptor in lymphocytes within lymphatic tissues
and therefore had similar consequences as treatment with s1p1 (functional)
antagonists: decreased egress of lymphocytes from lymphatic tissues, lymphopenia
and immunosuppression. the effects of thi were mimicked by downregulation of
s1p lyase in hematopoietic cells and by 4-deoxypyridoxine (dop), which inhibits
 xxxd3047xxx -dependent enzymes including s1p lyase (schwab et al. 2005).
thus, inhibition of s1p lyase emerged as a novel immunosuppressive principle. s1p
lyase-deficient mice indeed have lymphopenia, but they suffer from many other
pathologies in lung, heart, urinary tract and bone, have vascular defects and a
strongly reduced life span (vogel et al. 2009; schmahl et al. 2007). while a full
knockout of s1p lyase has features of a lipid storage disease, a partial restoration of
s1p lyase activity was sufficient to protect from organ damages while lymphocyte
trafficking remained impaired (vogel et al. 2009). as a consequence, there might be
a therapeutic window in which partial inhibition of s1p lyase could lead to clinical
immunosuppression without causing significant organ damage. on this background,
lx2931 (¼lx3305; fig. 1), which differs minimally from thi, was developed by
lexicon pharmaceuticals (princeton, nj, usa) for immunosuppression. lx2931/
3305 elevated s1p concentrations in lymphoid tissues, caused lymphopenia in
multiple species and prevented the development of arthritis in the mouse collageninduced arthritis model (bagdanoff et al. 2010). in a phase i clinical trial in healthy
subjects, the compound was well tolerated up to 180 mg daily and reduced lymphocyte counts (used as a surrogate marker for s1p lyase inhibition) by ~50 % at that
dose (bagdanoff et al. 2010). recently, a phase ii trial in patients with rheumatoid
arthritis on stable methotrexate therapy has been completed and showed a
favourable safety profile of lx2931/3305, but the compound failed the proof-ofconcept (see web sites http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/nct00903383?

d. meyer zu heringdorf et al.

pdfs/eular%202011%205-20-11%20finalv3.pdf). the company presently opts
for a scale-up in the hope to identify a therapeutically active dose http://www.
lexpharma.com/images/pdfs/eular%202011%205-20-11%20finalv3.pdf.
an interesting fact about all s1p lyase inhibitors is that neither thi nor
lexicon’s compounds directly inhibit the enzyme in vitro, and this cannot be
explained by the occurrence of active metabolites (bagdanoff et al. 2009, 2010).
dop inhibits all  xxxd3047xxx -dependent enzymes and therefore is highly
unspecific. thus, the run is open to find the first-in-class direct s1p lyase inhibitor.

5 s1p scavenging or clearing agents
the effectiveness of s1p-scavenging agents to attenuate the pro-angiogenic and
cancer promoting activities of s1p has first been shown with a monoclonal antibody
to s1p. the anti-s1p antibody reduced tumour progression and tumour angiogenesis in murine xenograft and allograft models, and reduced the vessel formation in
vegf- and  xxxg787xxx -containing matrigel plugs in vivo (visentin et al. 2006). a
humanized version of this antibody, sonepcizumab, developed by lpath therapeutics (san diego, ca, usa), reduced blood lymphocyte counts, indicating that it
was able to affect the blood-tissue-gradient of s1p (o’brien et al. 2009).
sonepcizumab inhibited choroidal and retinal neovascularization and sub-retinal
fibrosis in ocular angiogenesis models when injected into the vitreous body (xie
et al. 2009; caballero et al. 2009). from a screen of ~60 different lipids, the
antibody also recognized dihydro-s1p and sphingosylphosphorylcholine and had
a low affinity to  xxxd3235xxx  and sphingomyelin (o’c et al. 2009).
sphingomyelin is a highly abundant lipid (>1,000-fold excess over s1p; hannun
and obeid 2008) that might be able to bind sonepcizumab in relevant amounts.
nevertheless, sonepcizumab passed several preclinical toxicology tests, and its
safety and tolerability has been analysed in phase i clinical trials in patients with
refractory advanced solid tumours (oncology formulation asonep®) and in
patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration (ocular formulation
isonep®) (reviewed by sabbadini 2011). the favourable outcome led to its further
development for treatment of age-related macular degeneration (table 1).
noxxon pharma (berlin, germany) has chosen a different approach to s1p scavenging by developing an s1p-binding spiegelmer, nox-s93. up to now there are no
published data regarding this spiegelmer. on its web site http://www.noxxon.com/
index.php?option¼com_content&view¼article&id¼62&itemid¼101, the company
states that nox-s93 inhibited signalling of s1p through s1p1 and s1p3 with low
nanomolar affinity and induced transient lymphopenia in mice. target indications of
nox-s93 would be cancer angiogenesis, autoimmune disorders and ocular diseases.
another approach to remove extracellular s1p in conditions such as cancer,
inflammation, fibrosis and aberrant angiogenesis is the application of recombinant
soluble s1p lyase. s1p lyase from the prokaryote symbiobacterium thermophilum
disrupted s1p signalling in cell culture models, inhibited tumour cell-induced

pharmacology of the sphingosine-1-phosphate signalling system

249

angiogenesis in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane model, and effectively
reduced s1p plasma levels when injected intravenously in mice (huwiler et al.
2011). the advantage of the prokaryotic s1p lyase is its lack of an n-terminal
transmembrane domain that makes it a soluble enzyme, while eukaryotic s1p
lyases are integral membrane proteins.

6 concluding remarks
in conclusion, the s1p1 receptor has been established as a target for immunosuppression, while drugs that modulate the other s1p receptors or inhibit sks and s1p
lyase still await the proof of their clinical usefulness. a possible advantage of the
s1p cleaving or scavenging agents is their high specificity and the fact that their
activity is restricted to extracellular pools of s1p, while small molecule inhibitors
of sks or s1p lyase would also modulate intracellular levels of s1p, and moreover,
may have less specificity.
