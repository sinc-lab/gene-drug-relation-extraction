1 the modulation of the y-aminobutyric acida (gabaaj receptor by reduced metabolites of progesterone and deoxycorticosterone has been compared with that produced by depressant barbiturates in: (a) voltage-clamp recordings from bovine enzymatically isolated chromaffin cells in cell
culture, and (b) an assay of the specific binding of [3h]-muscimol to a preparation of porcine brain
membranes.
2 the progesterone metabolites 5a- and 5f-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one (> 30 nm) reversibly and dosedependently enhanced the amplitude of membrane currents elicited by locally applied gaba
(100 gm), and over the concentration range 30nm-too pm stimulated the binding of [3h]-muscimol.
in contrast, 5a- and 5#-pregnan-3#-ol-20-one (30 nm-ioo om) had little effect in either assay, indicating a marked stereoselectivity of steroid action.
3 scatchard analysis of the ligand binding data suggested an apparent increase in the number,
rather than the affinity, of detectable [3h]-muscimol binding sites as the principle action of the
active steroid isomers.
4 gaba-evoked currents were also potentiated by androsterone (1 ym) and the deoxycorticosterone metabolite 5a-pregnane-3a,21-diol-20-one (100nm).
5  xxxd3183xxx  (1o-1oojim), pentobarbitone (10-3001pm) and  xxxd2908xxx  (100-500 pm)
reversibly and dose-dependently potentiated the amplitude of gaba-evoked currents in the
absence of any change in their reversal potential.
6 at relatively high concentrations (> 30 pm)  xxxd3183xxx  and pentobarbitone directly elicited a
membrane current. it is concluded that such currents result from gabaa receptor-channel activation since they share a common reversal potential with gaba-evoked responses (-omv), are
reversibly antagonized by bicuculline (3pm), and potentiated by either diazepam (1 pm) or 5#pregnan-3a-ol-20-one (500 nm).
7  xxxd3183xxx  (1 pm-1 mm) dose-dependently enhanced the binding of [3h]-muscimol. in
common with the active steroids, an increase in the apparent number of binding sites was
responsible for this effect.
8 a saturating concentration (1 mm) of  xxxd3183xxx  in the ligand binding assay did not suppress
the degree of enhancement of control binding produced by 5#-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one (30nm-1001pm).
similarly the steroid, at a concentration of 100pm, did not influence the enhancement of [3h]muscimol binding by  xxxd3183xxx  (1 ym-1 mm). in all combinations of concentrations tested, the
effects of  xxxd3183xxx  and 5#-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one on [3h]-muscimol binding were additive.
9 in conjunction with previously published observations, the present data indicate close similarities in the gaba-mimetic and potentiating actions of barbiturates and steroids. however, the
results obtained with combinations of steroids and barbiturates in the ligand binding assay appear
inconsistent with the two classes of compound interacting with a common site to modulate the
gabaa receptor activity.

introduction

it is a generally held view that y- xxxd2177xxx 
(gaba) subserves an important inhibitory neurotransmitter function within the vertebrate central
nervous system. through activating gabaa receptors, gaba evokes an increase in membrane chloride conductance, an effect which usually leads to
membrane hyperpolarization and a decrease in
neuronal excitability. such actions of gaba are
subject to modulation by a variety of structurally
diverse drugs which possess anxiolytic, hypnotic or
general anaesthetic properties, the most extensively
studied being certain barbiturate and benzodiazepine
compounds (keane & biziere, 1987; martin, 1987;
simmonds & turner, 1987). by binding to distinct,
but interacting, regulatory sites upon the gabaa
receptor, some barbiturates and benzodiazepines
modulate the operation of the associated chlorideselective ionophore, causing predominantly an
enhancement of channel open-time or an increase in
opening frequency respectively (study & barker,
1981).
recently, it has been demonstrated that some
metabolites of progesterone and deoxycorticosterone enhance the effects of exogenously
applied gaba on cultured central neurones and
adrenomedullary chromafin cells (majewska et al.,
1986; callachan et al., 1987a; lambert et al., 1987).
furthermore, like barbiturates and benzodiazepines,
certain of these steroids potentiate inhibitory synaptic transmission mediated by gaba (harrison et
al., 1987ab).
several lines of evidence indicate that the steroids
act in a 'barbiturate-like' manner at the gabaa
receptor (majewska et al., 1986). thus in radioligand
binding assays, both classes of compound enhance
the specific binding of gabaa receptor agonists and
benzodiazepine receptor ligands to rat brain membranes (leeb-lundberg et al., 1980; olsen &
snowman, 1982; whittle & turner, 1982; harrison
et al., 1987; kirkness et al., 1987) and allosterically
inhibit the binding of the convulsant gaba antagonist
t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate
(tbps)
(squires et al., 1983; ramanjaneyulu & ticku, 1984;
majewska et al., 1986; harrison et al., 1987a). furthermore, in electrophysiological studies the potentiation of gaba-evoked responses produced by
either barbiturates or steroids is insensitive to the
benzodiazepine receptor antagonist rol5-1788
(simmonds, 1985; callachan et al., 1987a; cottrell et
al., 1987) and appears to be due to a prolongation of
gaba channel burst duration (barker et al., 1987;
callachan et al., 1987a; lambert et al., 1987).
however, despite these similarities, studies evaluating the anaesthetic effect of binary mixtures of the
synthetic steroid alphaxalone and depressant barbi-

turates suggest that they do not act through a
common site or mechanism (richards & white,
1981; halsey et al., 1986).
in the present study, the actions of barbiturates
and steroids were compared in voltage-clamp
recordings made from bovine chromaffin cells, which
possess gabaa receptors similar to those of central
neurones (bormann & clapham, 1985; cottrell et
al., 1985), and in a radioligand binding assay using
[3h]-muscimol and a membrane preparation
derived from porcine cerebral cortex. some structural requirements for steroid activity at the gabaa
receptor were also examined. whilst confirming a
number of similarities between the actions of the
barbiturates and steroids, the results of the radioligand binding assay suggest that they modulate
gabaa receptor function through different sites. a
preliminary account of some of this work has
appeared in abstract form (callachan et al., 1987b;
kirkness et al., 1987).

methods
dissociation and culture of chromaffin cells

bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin cells were isolated and cultured by the method of fenwick et al.
(1982) with minor modifications (cottrell et al., 1987)
and used in electrophysiological experiments 1-7
days after plating.

electrical recordings

agonist-activated currents were recorded using the
'whole cell' mode of the patch clamp technique, by
standard methods (hamill et al., 1981), and a list
electronics l/m epc-7 converter headstage and
amplifier. to facilitate voltage-clamping, cells were
selected which were devoid of processes and 8 to
18 pm in diameter. whole cell currents were low-pass
filtered (bessel characteristic) at 500 hz and recorded
on magnetic tape with an fm tape recorder (racal
store 4ds) for subsequent analysis. cells were continuously superfused (3-5 ml min- ) with a solution
containing (in mm): nacl 140, kci 2.8, mgcl2 2,
cacl2 1.0 and hepes-naoh 10 (ph 7.2). the
pipette solution employed to dialyse the cell interior
comprised (in mm): cscl 140, mgcl2 2, cac12 0.1,
egta 1.1 and hepes-naoh (ph 7.2). cs was
employed as the predominant internal cation to
suppress the various k conductances of the cell
membrane (marty & neher, 1985). drugs were
applied locally by pressure ejection (1.4 x 10ipa)
from modified patch pipettes; by diffusion from
coarse tipped (-201pm) micropipettes, or via the

barbiturates and steroids on gabaa receptors

superfusion medium. all experiments were conducted at room temperature (17-210c).
radioligand binding assays
a crude preparation of synaptic membranes was prepared from pig cerebral cortex essentially as
described previously (kirkness & turner, 1986). pig
brain was obtained fresh from a slaughterhouse and
the cortex removed, chopped, frozen and stored at
-70'c until use. cortex was thawed and homogenized in 10vol of 10mm hepes (ph 7.5) 300mm
sucrose containing the proteinase inhibitors edta
(1 mm),  xxxd302xxx  (1 mm), phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride (0.3mm), bacitracin (100mgl-1)
and trypsin inhibitors type ii-s and 11-0 (10 mgp1;
sigma). after an initial centrifugation at 1000g for
10min, the supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000g
for 20min to obtain a crude synaptosomal pellet.
this pellet was washed twice by resuspension in 20
vol. of ice-cold 10mm hepes (ph 7.5)/proteinase
inhibitors, followed by centrifugation at 48,000g for
20min. the resuspended pellet was stored frozen at
-20°c for up to 2months. before assay of receptor
binding, the membranes were thawed, washed once
with 20mm potassium phosphate buffer (ph7.5)/
100mm kci and dialysed for 20h against 500vol. of
the same buffer containing 0.1 mm edta and 0.02%

(w/v) nan3.

the binding of [3h]-muscimol to the synaptic
membrane preparation was performed by a filtration
assay (williams & risley, 1979). unless stated otherwise, membranes (0.4-0.7mg) were incubated in a
total volume of 0.5 ml of 20mm potassium phosphate
buffer (ph 7.5)/100mm kcl for 30min at 0°c in the
presence of 5 nm [3h]-muscimol and various concentrations of drugs. non-specific binding was measured
in the presence of 50pm muscimol. after incubation,
samples were diluted with 4 ml of assay buffer and
immediately filtered on gf/b filters (whatman)
under suction. filters were washed twice with 4 ml of
assay buffer, dried and counted for radioactivity in
5 ml of optiphase safe (lkb). all experimental
points were obtained in triplicate. protein was determined by the method of lowry et al. (1951) with
bovine  xxxg124xxx  as standard.
data analysis

data stored on magnetic tape were analysed by
several methods. whole cell currents elicited by
locally applied agonists were either played out at
reduced tape speed onto a pen recorder and subsequently inspected by eye, or analysed by a computer
programme (dempster, 1988) run on a pdp 11-73
minicomputer. in the latter method, whole cell currents were digitised into 512-1024 points at 100hz,

1259

inspected on a display screen and edited. four validated signal records were then averaged, analysed,
and for illustration, plotted on a hewlett packard
7470a plotter, records of membrane noise evoked
by bath-applied agonists were low-pass filtered
(200hz, butterworth characteristic) and digitised
into 512 points at a sampling rate of 2.5 ms. the
mean current induced by the agonist was then calculated by computer programme (dempster, 1988)
from the average of 16 such 512 point samples. all
quantitative results are expressed as the arithmetic
mean + s.e.mean.
drugs used

the reagents used in the study were: y-aminobutyric
acid (gaba), (+)-bicuculline, muscimol, picrotoxinin, 5a-androstan-3a-ol-17-one, 5a-pregnan3a-ol-20-one, 5a-pregnan-3f-ol-20-one, 5fi-pregnan3a-ol-20-one, 5fi-pregnan-3fi-ol-20-one, 5a-pregnane3a, 21-diol-20-one,  xxxd2908xxx , sodium pentobarbitone, sodium  xxxd3183xxx  ( xxxd3183xxx )
(all obtained from sigma), diazepam (roche) and
[methylene-3h]-muscimol (8-13 ci mmol- 1) (amersham international). stock solutions of the steroids
and diazepam were prepared in ethanol. the final
concentrations of ethanol in the radioligand binding
assay and electrophysiological experiments never
exceeded 0.5% (vol/vol) and 0.1% (vol/vol) respectively. at such concentrations, ethanol influenced
neither the specific binding of [3h]-muscimol measured in the absence of drugs, nor the amplitude of
transmembrane currents elicited by gaba.
results
potentiation of gaba-evoked currents by
pregnane steroids

the structure of the four pregnane steroids examined
in detail in this study are indicated in figure 1
together with traces illustrating their influence upon
responses to gaba, recorded under voltage clamp,
from a chromaffin cell. 5a-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one and
5fi-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one, each bath-applied at concentrations of 30 and 100 nm, dose-dependently
enhanced the amplitude of inward currents evoked
by locally applied gaba (100pm) (figure 1 and
table 1). such potentiation was rapid in onset,
occurring immediately upon the introduction of the
steroids to the bath, and was readily reversed upon
washout. there was no significant difference between
the degree of potentiation produced by 5a-pregnan3a-ol-20-one and 5fi-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one at either
dose tested (t test, p > 0.1).

below the plane of the molecule. in 51-pregnan-3fl-ol-20-one the 3-hydroxyl function lies above the plane of the

respectively. all currents were recorded at a holding potential of -60mv. the traces illustrated are computer
generated averages of 4 responses to gaba (see methods).

responses

pregnane

progesterone metabolite sf-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one. the broken line at c3 indicates that the hydroxyl

in contrast to the 3a-ol isomers, pregnane steroids
in which the 3-hydtoxyl group is in the #-position
lack potency in potentiating gaba-evoked currents.
thus low concentrations (30-100nm) of 5a-pregnan3fi-ol-20-one and 5fl-pregnan-3fi-ol-20-one had no
effect upon the amplitude of responses to locally
applied gaba (1001m) evoked from cells demonstrably sensitive to the 3a-ol-isomers (figure 1). furthermore, far greater concentrations (1-10.um) of the
3#-ol-isomers produced relatively little potentiation
of gaba-evoked responses (table 1). the hormone
progesterone (10pum) from which the pregnane
isomers are derived by reductive metabolism had no

effect on gaba-evoked currents (n = 7) confirming
earlier findings (callachan et al., 1987a).
the deoxycorticosterone metabolite 5a-pregnane3a,21-diol-20-one and the sex hormone androsterone
(5a-androstan-3a-ol-17-one) have previously been
shown to potentiate responses to exogenously
applied gaba recorded from rodent central neurones (simmonds et al., 1984; harrison et al., 1987a).
in the present study, 5a-pregnan-3a,21-diol-20-one
(100 nm) and androsterone (1 pm) enhanced the
amplitude of gaba-evoked currents to
201.6 + 16.9% (n = 9) and 202.2 + 12.8% (n = 11) of
their control values, respectively, a degree of poten-

(30 nm) (table 1).

potentiation of gaba-evoked currents by depressant

barbiturates

pentobarbitone, within the concentration range 10300 ym, dose-dependently enhanced the amplitude of
transmembrane currents evoked by locally applied
gaba (100pm). a qualitatively similar potentiation
of gaba-evoked responses occurred with bathapplied  xxxd3183xxx  (10-100.pm) or  xxxd2908xxx  (100-500 pm) (figure 2a, b). the dose-effect
curves presented in figure 2b indicate that the 3
barbiturates potentiate the amplitude of gabaevoked currents with the order of potency:
 xxxd3183xxx  > pentobarbitone >  xxxd2908xxx .
by comparing equieffective concentrations of the
various modulators,  xxxd3183xxx  and pentobarbitone were estimated respectively to be 130 and 400
fold less potent than the steroid 5#-pregnan-3a-ol20-one in potentiating responses to gaba. as the
dose-effect curves for these 3 drugs are approximately parallel (figure 2b), such estimates should be
independent of the level of potentiation at which the
comparison is performed. since the range of  xxxd2908xxx  concentrations examined was limited, no
attempt was made to quantify its relative potency.
the potentiating effect of the barbiturate compounds
was not associated with any change in the reversal
potential of the gaba response, this being illustrated for pentobarbitone in figure 2c. similarly, the
potentiation of gaba-evoked currents due to 5flpregnan-3a-ol-20-one does not involve any shift in
their reversal potential (callachan et al., 1987a).

direct agonist action of barbiturates

 xxxd3183xxx  and pentobarbitone, when bathapplied at concentrations greater than those necessary for substantial potentiation of gaba-evoked
currents, directly activated a membrane conductance
in bovine chromaffin cells. representative records of
the inward currents evoked by pentobarbitone and
 xxxd3183xxx , each applied to a chromaflin cell at a
concentration of 100pm are illustrated in figure
3a,b. although the relative potencies of these two
barbiturates were not assessed in detail,  xxxd3183xxx  (1001mm) consistently evoked a larger current
response (-22.4 + 10.9 pa, n = 4) than an equimolar concentration of pentobarbitone (-3.3 +
1.2 pa, n = 4) in the same sample of cells.  xxxd2908xxx  (100 pm) was ineffective when applied to
cells demonstrably sensitive to  xxxd3183xxx 
(100 mm). the agonist actions of these barbiturates
thus appear to parallel their potencies as potentiating agents.
relatively high concentrations (1 mm) of bathapplied pentobarbitone or  xxxd3183xxx  elicited a
complex response consisting of an initial peak
inward current which gradually declined to a plateau
level. during washout of the barbiturate, a transient
increase in inward current was often observed. this
phenomenon was particularly pronounced when
pentobarbitone (5mm) was rapidly applied to cells
by the microperfusion technique, as shown in figure
3c. indeed, under such conditions, the current
observed during wash off was of a greater amplitude
than the initial response to pentobarbitone. similar
currents in response to pentobarbitone have been
recorded from frog sensory neurones and may possibly be attributed to blockade of the gabaa
receptor-linked chloride ion channel by pentobarbitone at high concentrations, a notion supported by

concentration of the modulating drug in the bathing medium. data points are the mean values of the number of
observations indicated adjacent to each symbol. vertical lines indicate the s.e.mean. (c) relationships between
response amplitude (igaba) and holding potential (vs) for gaba (100.m) applied locally in the absence (0) and

potentials of 1.0 and 2.0 mv in the absence and presence of pentobarbitone, respectively.

the observation that such currents are suppressed by
bicuculline (akaike et al., 1987).
the membrane currents evoked by the barbiturates were more conveniently studied using the technique of local, pressure application. figure 4a
illustrates current responses to locally applied pentobarbitone (1 mm), recorded over a range of holding
potentials (-60 to 60mv). from such experiments
the reversal potential of the pentobarbitone-induced
response was estimated, by interpolation, to be
+ 1.0 + 0.5 mv (n = 4), a value similar to that found
for gaba (+3.0mv, cottrell et al., 1985) when the
internal and external concentrations of chloride ions
are essentially equal. additionally currents elicited
by pentobarbitone were reversibly suppressed by the
gabaa receptor antagonist bicuculline (3 pm;

figure 4b) and potentiated to 190 + 12% (n = 6) of
their control value by diazepam (1 ,m; figure 4b). in
common with responses to gaba, currents evoked
by pentobarbitone were greatly enhanced in amplitude by the pregnane steroid 5fi-pregnan-3a-ol-20one. at a concentration of 500 nm, this steroid potentiated currents elicited by gaba (100 um) and pentobarbitone (1 mm) to 789 + 129% (n = 7) and
1156 + 199% (n = 6) of their control values, respectively (figure 4c,d). collectively, these data reinforce
the prevalent notion that certain barbiturates, at
relatively high doses, may activate the chloride ion
channel associated with the gabaa receptor,
perhaps by their association with an allosteric modulatory site (barker & ransom, 1978; higashi &
nishi, 1982; owen et al., 1986; akaike et al., 1987).

agonist-induced currents were quantified by a computer programme as described in methods. the delay in
the onset of barbiturate-evoked currents is due to the

effect partly due to a suppression of potassium conductance in some cells (higashi & nishi, 1982). in
the present experiments the direct effects of barbiturates were investigated using a caesium-based pipette
solution to suppress the various potassium conductances of the chromaffin cell (marty & neher, 1985)
and, hence, the possibility that barbiturates exert an
influence on chromaffin cell potassium channels
remains to be determined.
enhancement of [3h]-muscimol binding by pregnane
steroids
the specific binding of [3h]-muscimol to a crude
preparation of cerebral cortex membranes was

1263

enhanced, in a dose-dependent manner, by both 5apregnan-3a-ol-20-one and 5fi-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one
(30nm-100pm). the stimulation of binding observed
with the highest concentration of steroid tested
(100pum), was approximately 55% of control for
either of the 3a-ol isomers (figure 5a). through
out the concentration range examined, 5a-pregnan3a-ol-20-one and 5fi-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one were
approximately equipotent in stimulating [3h]muscimol binding, reinforcing the observation that
the 3a-ol-isomers produce a similar degree of potentiation of the gaba-evoked current. in further
corroboration of the results obtained with electrophysiological techniques, 5a-pregnan-3fi-ol-20-one
and 5f-pregnan-3fi-ol-20-one (30nm-too pm) were
only weakly active in the ligand binding assay,
producing only a 10-15% enhancement of [3h]muscimol binding at a concentration of 100ym
(figure 5a). the effect of the active 3a-ol isomers was
dependent upon the presence of chloride ions in the
assay. hence the [3h]-muscimol binding activity of
membranes prepared and assayed in the absence of
kcl was insensitive to 5a-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one or
5fi-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one (10ym). addition to the
assay medium of kcl (100mm) or nacl (100mm),
but not k2so4 (50mm), restored the ability of the
3a-ol isomers to stimulate control binding. the
gabaa antagonist picrotoxinin (10pm) reduced the
stimulation of control binding by 3m 5f#-pregnan3a-ol-20-one from 137.0 + 5.0% to 110.0 + 4.0%
(n = 4). scatchard analysis of control [3h]-muscimol
binding indicated a single class of high affinity
binding sites (figure 5b). at concentrations of 3ym,
5a-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one or 5fi-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one
had little effect on the affinity of [3h]-muscimol
binding but significantly increased the apparent total
number of high-affinity binding sites in the membrane (figure sb).

enhancement of [3h]-muscimol binding by
barbiturate/steroid combinations
depressant barbiturates and pregnane steroids exert
strikingly similar actions on the gabaa receptor in
electrophysiological and ligand binding assays. in
order to examine the possibility that these two
classes of compounds act through a common regulatory site on the receptor, the effect of their combined
action on [3h]-muscimol binding was determined.
enhancement by  xxxd3183xxx  alone was detectable
at 1-10 um and was maximal (65% enhancement) at
a concentration of 1 mm (figure 6a). it is notable
that the lowest concentration at which enhancement
could be observed with  xxxd3183xxx  was 10-100
fold greater than for 5fi-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one; a difference in potency comparable to that observed in
the electrophysiological studies. the magnitude of

the data represent the mean and range of values from three separate observations.

the enhancements produced by a range of  xxxd3183xxx  concentrations was little affected by the inclusion of 5fi-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one (100pm) in the assay
(figure 6a). similarly, the extent to which a range of
5#-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one concentrations stimulated
control binding was not altered significantly by the
presence of a saturating concentration (1 mm) of
 xxxd3183xxx  (figure 6b). in all combinations of
concentrations examined, the enhancements by the
barbiturate and the steroid were additive. using
mixtures of  xxxd3183xxx , 5fi-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one
and another active steroid, alphaxalone (harrison &
simmonds, 1984), it was found that only combinations of barbiturate and steroid produced
enhancing effects which were additive. [3h]-muscimol binding was enhanced by 1 mm  xxxd3183xxx 
(64 + 4%; n = 3), 10mm 5fi-pregnan-3ax-ol-20-one
(36 + 2%; n = 3) and 10pm alphaxalone (34 ± 3%;
n = 3) acting individually. in combination, stimulation by  xxxd3183xxx  and alphaxalone was strictly
additive (98 ± 6%; n = 3), whereas a combination of
the two steroids was no more effective than either
agent alone (37 ± 6%; n = 3).
scatchard analysis of [3h]-muscimol binding in
the presence of  xxxd3183xxx  and 5fi-pregnan-3a-ol20-one, indicated that both compounds, acting either
alone or together, stimulated binding principally by
increasing the number of detectable high-affihrity
binding sites in the membrane (figure 6c, table\2).
the [3h]-muscimol binding affinity, as indicated by
the kd values, was little affected by either agent
either alone or in combination.

discussion
the results of the present study indicate that modulation of the gabaa receptor by pregnane steroids
is a highly stereoselective phenomenon. whilst 5aand 5f-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one were potent in stimulating [3h]-muscimol binding and enhancing the
membrane currents evoked by gaba, their corresponding 3fi-ol-isomers were virtually devoid of

activity. it has been demonstrated previously that
the steroid anaesthetic alphaxalone, which differs
from 5a-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one in its possession of a
ketone group at cll, is effective in potentiating
responses to gaba (harrison & simmonds, 1984;
barker et al., 1987; cottrell et al., 1987). in accord
with the relative inactivity of the 3fi-ol pregnane
steroids examined here, the f-hydroxy isomer of alphaxalone (betaxalone) is ineffective in potentiating
responses to gaba (harrison & simmonds, 1984;
barker et al., 1987) and at relatively high concentrations (10-100pm) acts as an antagonist (cottrell et
al., 1987). electrophysiological and radioligand
binding experiments performed on cultured rodent
central neurones and rat brain synaptosomal membranes, respectively, by harrison et al. (1987a) also
show the a configuration of the c3 hydroxyl group
to be an essential structural feature and, additionally, demonstrate the requirement for a saturated
pregnane skeleton and the presence of a ketone
group at c20 for steroid modulation of the gabaa
receptor.
the strict structural requirements for activity
suggest an interaction of the steroid with a specific
protein binding site. however, in the case of these
highly lipophilic steroids, other interpretations are
also plausible. although the isomeric pairs
alphaxalone/betaxalone and 5a-pregnan-3a-ol-20one/5a-pregnan-3fi-ol-20-one do not vary significantly in their lipid solubility or molecular volume,
they do differ in the degree of disorder which they
induce in model membranes, the isomers which are
potent in potentiating gaba being the most effective in this respect (lawrence & gill, 1975). hence it
is conceivable that the stereoselective effects displayed by the steroids derive from a perturbation of
the lipid structures adjacent to the gabaa receptor.
alternatively, an interaction between the steroids
and a hydrophobic pocket of the gabaa receptor
complex itself may be postulated (lambert & peters,
1988). in this respect it is known that a range of
general anaesthetics competitively inhibit the activity
of the purified protein firefly luciferase, and such an

barbiturates and steroids on gabaa receptors

action is well correlated with their anaesthetic
potency (franks & lieb, 1987). however, although
some progesterone metabolites share this ability to
inhibit a luciferase enzyme, their effect lacks appropriate stereoselectivity and does not correlate with
their potency as anaesthetics (banks & peace, 1985).
we are presently internally perfusing bovine chromaffin cells with the active steroids in an attempt to
elucidate their site of action.
whatever the physical nature of the 'site' with
which the steroids interact may be, there are close
similarities between their actions and those of some
barbiturates upon the gabaa receptor. both classes
of compound potentiate membrane currents elicited
by exogenously applied gaba and prolong the
decay of inhibitory postsynaptic currents mediated
by gaba in cultured neurones of hippocampal
origin (segal & barker, 1984; harrison et al., 1987b).
a prolongation of the gaba channel burst duration
by barbiturates and steroids is likely to underlie such
effects (study & barker 1981; barker et al., 1987;
callachan et al., 1987a; lambert et al., 1987).
further similarities between the actions of barbiturates and steroids are apparent in the results of
radioligand binding experiments, where representatives of each class of compound have been shown to
displace the binding of [35s]-tbps and to enhance
[3h]-flunitrazepam and [3h]-muscimol binding
(harrison & simmonds, 1984; simmonds et al.,
1984; harrison et al., 1987a; kirkness et al., 1987).
in addition, the types of [35s]-tbps binding inhibition caused by the depressant steroid, 5o-pregnan3a-ol-20-one (mixed) and the putative excitatory

steroid,  xxxd544xxx  (competitive) are
similar to that described for depressant and convulsant barbiturates, respectively (ticku et al., 1985;
trifiletti et al., 1985; majewska & schwartz, 1987).
thus there is considerable experimental evidence
which is consistent with the notion that barbiturates
and steroids may exert their effects upon the gabaa
receptor through a common site.
in the present study this possibility was evaluated
by examining  xxxd3183xxx  and 5fl-pregnan-3a-ol20-one, either alone or in combination, for their
effects on [3h]-muscimol binding to a crude membrane preparation. over the concentration ranges
examined, each compound increased binding, in a
dose-dependent manner, by a maximum of 50-70%.
scatchard analysis indicated that, in both cases, the
stimulation resulted principally from an increase in
the number of detectable high-affinity binding sites
in the membrane. enhancement of [3h]-muscimol
binding by the barbiturate, pentobarbitone and the
steroid, alphaxalone has also been shown to occur
by this mechanism (olsen & snowman, 1982, harrison & simmonds, 1984). although enhancement by
 xxxd3183xxx  appears to reach a maximum value at

1267

the highest concentrations examined (figure 6), the
saturating concentration of 5fl-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one
could not be established owing to its limited solubility. the extent by which  xxxd3183xxx  stimulated
control binding was unaffected by the presence of
100pm 5,b-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one, i.e. the magnitudes
of the enhancements caused by each compound were
additive. similarly, a saturating concentration of
 xxxd3183xxx  did not affect the degree of stimulation by the steroid. in contrast, the stimulatory
effects of combinations of pentobarbitone and  xxxd3183xxx  or alphaxalone and 5f,-pregnan-3a-ol-20one were not additive. collectively, these results
suggest that, under the conditions of the radioligand
binding assay,  xxxd3183xxx  and 5,b-pregnan-3a-ol20-one stimulate [3h]-muscimol binding by interacting with distinct modulatory sites.
a previous study, describing stimulation of gaba
receptor binding by the hypnotic agent etomidate,
also indicated that binding enhancement by this
compound was additive with that produced by the
barbiturate, pentobarbitone (thyagarajan et al.,
1983). although additive effects of etomidate and
pentobarbitone were not detected by other workers
(quast & brenner, 1983), this discrepancy may result
from the binding assay conditions which varied considerably between the two investigations. studies
aimed at clarifying the nature of the interactions
between the gabaa receptor and combinations of
barbiturates, steroids and other depressant agents
are currently in progress. several observations made
in electrophysiological studies are consistent with the
barbiturates and steroids interacting with distinct
sites to modulate gabaa receptor function. it has
previously been demonstrated that the direct
'agonist' action of alphaxalone, 5fi-pregnan-3a-ol-20one or 5a-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one is potentiated by
 xxxd2908xxx  (cottrell et al., 1987; callachan et
al., 1987a; lambert & peters, 1988), and in the
present study 5fl-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one was found to
enhance greatly the amplitude of membrane currents
elicited by pentobarbitone. however, conclusive electrophysiological evidence for separate sites of interaction will require a quantitative assessment of the
effects of a range of barbiturate and steroid concentrations upon gaba-evoked responses.
it has been shown previously that at concentrations (>300nm) greater than those required for a
demonstrable potentiation of gaba-evoked
responses, the steroids 5fi-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one and
alphaxalone directly activate a transmembrane
current in cultured chromaffin cells (cottrell et al.,
1987; callachan et al., 1987; lambert et al., 1987).
such currents are antagonized by bicuculline, potentiated by diazepam, and from measurements of their
reversal potential appear to be mediated by chloride
ions. the present study demonstrates that currents

1268

j.a. peters et al.

elicited by high concentrations of the barbiturates
 xxxd3183xxx  and pentobarbitone share all of these
features, confirming data obtained in studies of the
postsynaptic actions of pentobarbitone in other
systems (e.g. owen et al., 1986; akaike et al., 1987).
in addition to the barbiturates and steroids, gabaa
agonist actions have been found for the hypnotic
anticonvulsant chlormethiazole (hales & lambert,
1988a) and the general anaesthetics propofol (hales
& lambert 1988b) and propanidid (lambert &
peters, unpublished observations). it seems unlikely
that such chemically diverse structures bind to the
gaba recognition site to activate the associated
chloride ion channel, but alternatively they may act
to perturb the membrane around the gaba ion
channel and in some way alter the rate constants
governing ion channel opening and closing.
in conclusion, the present study emphasizes the

similarities between the depressant barbiturates and
steroids in both radioligand and electrophysiological
experiments, but interaction studies suggest such
sites may be distinct. whatever the nature of the
barbiturate/steroid binding site(s), the demonstration
of the potent modulation of gabaa receptors by
endogenous steroids offers the future prospect of the
development of new steroidal general anaesthetics
and anticonvulsants, and a better understanding of
the influence of the endocrine system on central
nervous system function.
