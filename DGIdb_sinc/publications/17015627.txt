effective than glucantime in reducing lesion size. in contrast, mice
infected with amastigotes of the gb50r strain failed to respond to
treatment with either  xxxd2215xxx  or glucantime at the same
concentrations used for the gbs strain (fig. 2b); such unresponsiveness to  xxxd2215xxx  confirmed the genetic stability of the
resistant phenotype of the gb50r strain, and the lack of an effect
of glucantime on the course of the infection with the gb50r strain
suggests the occurrence of cross-resistance to both drugs. after 49
days of treatment with either drug alone, mice were treated with

the chemotherapy currently available for leishmaniasis relies on the administration of antimonial compounds; their toxicity and the emergence and spread of drug resistance emphasize the urgent need for affordable alternative drugs (3, 5). the
most significant advance has been the introduction of the first
effective oral treatment with miltefosine, an alkyl-lysophospholipid, for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (16).  xxxd2215xxx  (gb), an inhibitor of k⫹atp channels (2) and p-glycoprotein (7), has been reported to inhibit the uptake and
multiplication of leishmania within macrophages in vitro (13).
this effect has been associated with increased responsiveness
to gamma interferon and with stimulation of th1 mechanisms
in general (13, 14). in the present study, we evaluate the effect
of  xxxd2215xxx  against leishmania (leishmania) mexicana
infection of balb/c mice and the efficacy of a combined treatment with  xxxd2215xxx  and glucantime. the 50% effective
concentration against promastigotes of l. (l.) mexicana
(mhom/ve/90/9012) growing in schneider’s drosophila medium was 50 ␮m, and a  xxxd2215xxx -resistant line was selected at 50 ␮m gb (gb50r strain). both the glibenclamidesensitive (gbs) and gb50r strains showed a moderate
susceptibility to glucantime; however, a fixed concentration of
50 ␮m  xxxd2215xxx  in combination with various concentrations of glucantime caused an inhibition of 80 to 90% in cell
growth that was independent of the sensitivity of the strain to
 xxxd2215xxx  (fig. 1).
significant reduction in lesion size (p ⬍ 0.0001) was evident
when balb/c mice infected with gbs amastigotes were administered  xxxd2215xxx  on the 20 days after infection; subsequent lesion enlargement was inhibited by 1.25 mg gb/kg of
body weight/day. similar to in vitro results, the effect in vivo
was dose dependent. the effect of  xxxd2215xxx  at 80 mg/kg/day,
which is forty times lower than the 50% lethal dose (3,250 mg/kg)
for mice, was compared to the effect of 100 mg/kg/day glucantime.
although both drugs inhibited lesion enlargement in mice infected with the gbs strain (fig. 2a),  xxxd2215xxx  proved more

wild-type and  xxxd2215xxx -resistant strains. promastigotes of l. (l.)
mexicana gbs and gb50r strains were cultured in schneider’s drosophila medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. aliquots of stationary-phase gbs strain culture were incubated with increasing concentrations of glucantime (1.5 g/5 ml; aventis pharm ltda, brazil) in
the absence or presence of 50 ␮m  xxxd2215xxx  (research biochemical international, natick mass.) (13); promastigotes of gb50r were
subjected to the same  xxxd2215xxx  treatment, i.e., absence or presence. parasite growth was estimated by direct counting in a newbauer
chamber and expressed as the cell number relative to those for control
cultures. the results are expressed as means ⫾ standard errors of the
means (n ⫽ 3). the 50% effective concentration value, which is given
without correction due to the extensive binding to serum proteins of
 xxxd2215xxx , was 54.3 ⫾ 1.0 ␮m according to the linear interpolation
method of huber and koella (9).

 xxxd2215xxx  reduced the rate of lesion growth in balb/c mice infected with leishmania (leishmania)
mexicana, the effect was dose dependent, and the highest dose proved more effective than glucantime. crossresistance to glucantime was found in animals infected with a  xxxd2215xxx -resistant line, but combined
therapy reduced lesion progression even in the  xxxd2215xxx -resistant strain.

both drugs in combination for 20 more days. lesion development
in mice infected with the gbs strain diminished but did not stop
when mice were treated with either drug for 49 days, ceased
completely when drug combination was used for 20 days, and
recovered when the treatment was stopped (fig. 2c); this suggests that each drug adds to the antileishmanial activity of the
other. in contrast, lesion development in mice infected with the
gb50r strain was significantly (p ⬍ 0.0001) reduced by the combined drugs (fig. 2d). this result is surprising; although there is
cross-resistance between the drugs, they are effective when administered together.
the mode of action of  xxxd2215xxx  against leishmania has
not yet been established; the drug has been described as a

classical inhibitor of the k⫹atp channels in pancreatic ␤ cells
whose target is the sur receptor, a protein belonging to the
 xxxg22xxx  family, which has not been identified in
leishmania. recently, the inhibitory effect of  xxxd2215xxx  on
different abc transporters with dissimilar functions, including
p-glycoprotein, was demonstrated (7); such transporters have
been described for leishmania spp. (4, 10, 11, 12). also, a role
for ca⫹2 homeostasis seems to be related to the antileishmanial activity of  xxxd2215xxx  (14).
 xxxd2215xxx  and glucantime do not seem to share the
same route of entry into leishmania organisms and probably
have different mechanisms of action. systems for arsenic detoxification have been identified in all living organisms, and an

mice. mice (5 to 6 weeks old, 20 to 25 g) were infected in the footpad on day 0 with 1.25 ⫻ 106 amastigotes of gbs (a and c) or gb50r (b and
d) l. (l.) mexicana. twenty days after infection, mice were intraperitoneally treated daily for 20 days with 5%  xxxd1896xxx  (control), 100
mg/kg of glucantime (glu), or 80 mg/kg of  xxxd2215xxx . the 50% lethal dose of  xxxd2215xxx  estimated for mice is 3,250 mg/kg. lesion
appearance was monitored, and lesion size was measured daily starting with the initiation of treatment. the same groups of mice received daily
for 20 more days the combined regimen with 75 mg/kg glucantime and 60 mg/kg  xxxd2215xxx  (arrow). statistical assessment of differences
between treatments was done through one-way analysis of variance and duncan’s multiple comparison tests at a p value of ⬍0.05. each point
represents the mean ⫾ standard error of the mean (n ⫽ 7). for mice receiving glucantime treatment versus untreated mice, mice receiving
 xxxd2215xxx  treatment versus untreated mice, and mice receiving glucantime treatment versus  xxxd2215xxx -treated mice, the p values were
⬍0.0001.

aquaglyceroporin system was identified in l. tarentolae and l.
(l.) major (6, 8, 15). probably, the uptake of  xxxd2215xxx , a
sulfonylurea, occurs through a mechanism different from that
for glucantime. it would be interesting to know whether glucantime and  xxxd2215xxx  share an efflux system and whether
there are differences between the drugs in the affinity of this
system for them; also, it would be worthwhile to evaluate the
eventual coexpression of different drug transporters.
the combination of  xxxd2215xxx  and glucantime enhanced
the antileishmanial effect in vitro as well as in vivo. the mechanism of this effect is not known; an additive effect could
explain the lesion reduction found in mice infected with gbs
but not with gb50r. experiments are in progress in order to
evaluate the possible occurrence of a synergistic effect of  xxxd2215xxx  and glucantime. a synergistic effect of  xxxd2215xxx 
and gamma interferon on the clearance of l. (l.) major by
macrophages has been found (14); also, a synergistic effect has
been found in the treatment of leishmaniasis with glucantime
combined with other drugs (1, 6).
in summary,  xxxd2215xxx  affects the viability of l. (l.)
mexicana in vivo and in vitro; in both cases, drug effects were
dose dependent.  xxxd2215xxx  has a higher efficacy and tolerance at the concentration used for the treatment of l. (l.)
mexicana than glucantime does. a cross-resistance to both
 xxxd2215xxx  and glucantime was evidenced. treatment of
experimental mice with the combination of these drugs was
highly effective against infections with both the glibenclamidesensitive line and the resistant line.
