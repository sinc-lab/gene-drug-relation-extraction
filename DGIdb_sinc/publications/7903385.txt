binding and functional characterization of alpha-2 adrenergic receptor subtypes on pig vascular endothelium.  alpha-2 adrenergic receptor subtypes were characterized in membranes of pig vascular endothelium using [3h]rauwolscine. alpha-2 adrenergic receptor subtypes that mediate endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation were studied in vitro by using ring segments of pig epicardial coronary arteries. specific [3h]rauwolscine binding in endothelial membranes was saturable and to a single class of high-affinity sites with a mean kd of 0.217 +/- 0.05 nm and bmax of 156 +/- 28 fmol/mg of protein. nonlinear regression analysis indicated that competition binding curves for drugs that distinguish the  xxxg88xxx  subtype from the  xxxg90xxx  subtype fit best to two-site binding models. kl values for drugs in binding to endothelial alpha-2 adrenergic receptors correlated well with their kl values for alpha-2a (r = .98) and alpha-2c (r = .97) adrenergic receptor subtypes identified in other tissues. vascular endothelium contained 23% alpha-2a and 77% alpha-2c adrenergic receptors. in the presence of indomethacin, the rank order of potency for agonists that cause endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation was p-iodoclonidine > clonidine > uk-14,304 >  xxxd2241xxx  > epinephrine > norepinephrine. kb values for antagonist inhibition of epinephrine-induced, endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation correlated best with kl values for antagonist binding at the  xxxg88xxx  subtype. these results suggest that the alpha-2a and  xxxg90xxx  subtypes are present on pig vascular endothelium and that the  xxxg88xxx  subtype mediates indomethacin-insensitive, endothelium-dependent relaxation of pig epicardial coronary arteries.
