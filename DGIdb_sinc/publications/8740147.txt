amezinium and  xxxd1818xxx  are substrates of uptake:
and potent inhibitors of  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx 
in perfused lungs of rats

received: 30 october 1995/accepted: 21 december 1995

abstract previous studies have resulted in the classification of amezinium as a selective inhibitor of neuronal  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  (mao), because it is a much
more potent mao inhibitor in intact tissues, in which
it is accumulated in noradrenergic neurones by uptak%, than in tissue homogenates. in the present study,
the effects of amezinium on the deamination of noradrenaline were investigated in intact lungs of rats, since
the pulmonary endothelial cells are a site where the
catecholamine transporter is non-neuronal uptake> in
addition, another drug that is both a substrate of uptake~ and a m a o inhibitor,  xxxd1818xxx , was investigated in the study.
the first aim of the study was to show whether
amezinium and  xxxd1818xxx  are substrates of uptake1
in rat lungs. after loading of isolated perfused lungs
with 3h-noradrenaline (mao and  xxxg487xxx  (comt) inhibited), the efftux of 3h-noradrenaline was measured for 30 min. when 1 btmol/1
amezinium or 15 btmol/1  xxxd1818xxx  was added
for the last 15 min of efflux, there was a rapid and
marked increase in the fractional rate of loss of 3hnoradrenaline, which was reduced by about 70% when
1 ~tmol/1 desipramine was present throughout the
efflux period. these results showed that both drugs
were substrates for uptake1 in rat lungs. in lungs
perfused with 1 nmol/1 3h-noradrenaline (comt
inhibited), 10, 30 and 300 nmol/1 amezinium caused
58%, 76% and 74% inhibition of noradrenaline
deamination, respectively, and 30, 300 and 3000 nmol/1
 xxxd1818xxx  caused 56%, 89% and 96% inhibition of

preliminary results of this study were presented to the 1993 meeting
of the australasian society of clinical and experimental pharmacologists and toxicologists (bryan-lluka 1993).

noradrenaline deamination, respectively. when  xxxg1358xxx  was also inhibited, i0 nmol/1 amezinium caused 84%
inhibition of the deamination of noradrenaline by
mao-a in the lungs. in contrast, in hearts perfused
with 10nmol/1 3h-noradrenaline under conditions
where the amine was accumulated by uptake2 (comt,
uptakel and vesicular transport inhibited), 10 nmol/1
amezinium had no effect and 300 nmol/1 amezinium
caused only 36% inhibition of deamination of noradrenaline.
the results when considered with previous reports
in the literature show that amezinium is about 1000
times more potent and  xxxd1818xxx  is about 20 times
more potent for mao inhibition in rat lungs than in
tissue homogenates, and the reason for their high potencies in the intact lungs is transport and accumulation of the drugs in the pulmonary endothelial cells by
uptake1. amezinium is much less potent as a mao
inhibitor in cells with the uptake2 transporter, such as
the myocardial cells of the heart. the results also confirmed previous reports that amezinium is highly selective for mao-a.

introduction

methods

the antihypotensive drug, amezinium, has been classified as a selective inhibitor of neuronal monoamine
oxidase (mao), because it has been shown that its
potency in inhibiting mao is much greater when it is
transported into and accumulates in noradrenergic
neurones in intact tissues (steppeler et al. 1980; lenke
et al. 1981) than when tissue homogenates are incubated in amezinium (steppeler et al. 1980; traut et al.
1981). evidence from accumulation of 3h-amezinium
in various organs, including rat heart, liver and adrenal
gland (traut et al. 1981) and from efflux studies in rat
vas deferens (langeloh et al. 1987) has shown that
amezinium is a substrate for uptake1 in noradrenergic
neurones. however, it is now known that the catecholamine transporter in noradrenergic neurones, uptakea, also exists in other cell types, including vascular
endothelial cells of rat lungs (bryan-lluka et al. 1992)
and epithelial cells of rabbit uterine endometrium
(kennedy and de la lande 1987) and of rabbit nasal
and oral mucosa (de la lande et al. 1987). despite
extensive studies on the pharmacological and biochemical effects of amezinium on a wide range of tissues
(steppeler et al. 1980; lehmann et al. 1981; lenke et al.
1981; traut et al. 1981; langeloh et al. 1987), its effects
on the dissipation of catecholamines in tissues with the
non-neuronal uptake1 transporter have not previously
been reported. in the present study, the mao inhibitory potency of amezinium was investigated in one of
these non-neuronal locations of uptake1, i.e. in perfused
lungs of rats, including an examination of whether the
drug was selective for mao-a in the lungs. we have
shown in an earlier study that amezinium is a potent
inhibitor of uptake~ in rat lungs with an ics0 value of
68 nmol/1 (bryan-lluka et al. 1992), but evidence as to
whether amezinium is a substrate or a non-transported
inhibitor in the pulmonary endothelial cells has not
been published. in addition, the potency of amezinium
as an inhibitor of m a o was investigated in the myocardial cells of perfused hearts of rats, since this is an
example where access of the substrate amines to mao
occurs via the other non-neuronal catecholamine
transporter, uptakea.
the noradrenergic neurone blocking agent,  xxxd1818xxx , is another drug that is both a substrate for
uptake~ in noradrenergic neurones (langeloh et al.
1987) and a mao inhibitor (javors et al. 1989).  xxxd1818xxx  has also been shown to inhibit uptakel in
rat lungs, with an icso value of 980 nmol/1 (bryanlluka et al. 1992), which is 15 times greater than the
corresponding value for amezinium (see above). in the
present study, experiments parallel to some of those
with amezinium were carried out to determine whether
 xxxd1818xxx  is a substrate for pulmonary uptake1 and
also to determine its potency as an inhibitor of m a o in
the rat lungs.

experimetzts to measure efflux of 3h-noradrenaline jkom rat
luncds. adult, male, specific pathogen-free, wistar rats (200-260 g)
were pretreated with 75 mg/kg  xxxd2850xxx  intraperitoneally 18 h and
2 h prior to the experiment to inhibit mao and were then anaesthetized with 60 mg/kg pentobarbitone sodium intraperitoneally. the
lung preparations were dissected as described by westwood et al.
(1996). all experiments were carried out according to the 'principles
of laboratory animal care' and the guidelines of the national health
and medical research council of australia.
the lungs were initially perfused via the pulmonary artery at
37 ° c and a flow rate of 9.9 ml/min for 30 rain with krebs solution
containing 5% bovine  xxxg124xxx  and 10 ~tmol/1 u-052l to
inhibit comt. the krebs solution contained (in retool/l) :  xxxg2020xxx 
118, kc1 4.7, cac12 25, khzpo4 1.2, mgso~ 1.2, nahco3 25,
glucose 11.7,  xxxd228xxx  0.57 and na2edta 0.040. 3h-noradrenaline (1 nmol/1) was added by infusing the 3h xxxd2850xxx  into the
perfusion solution at 0.1 ml/min for the last 10 rain of the preperfusion to load the lungs with 3h xxxd2850xxx  (westwood et al. 1996). the
lungs were then perfused at 37°c for 30rain with aerated (95%
oz and 5% co2) krebs solution containing 10 gmol/1 u-0521, but
no bovine  xxxg124xxx  or 3h xxxd2850xxx  and, in some experiments
(see results), 1 ~tmol/1 desipramine was present to inhibit uptake1.
after 15 rain of efflux, vehicle (controls), 1 ~mol/1 amezinium or
15 ~mol/1  xxxd1818xxx  was added to the perfusion solution for the
final 15 rain of the experiment. during efftux, continuous l-rain
samples of perfusion solution were collected from the cannula in the
left atrium (venous effluent). at the end of each experiment, the
preparation was removed from the ventilation chamber and treated
as described previously (bryan-lluka and o'donnell 1991). venous
effluent, 3h-noradrenaline infusion solution and lung homogenate
supernatant samples were assayed for 31t by liquid scintillation
counting.
the viability of the lungs was monitored by measuring the
perfusion pressure throughout the experiments (range in this study:
0.65-1.9 kpa) and by calculating the lung weight at the end of each
experiment, expressed as a percentage of the body weight (range in
this study: 0.42-0.65%). preparations with a perfusion pressure
greater than 2 kpa or a lung weight greater than 0.75% of the body
weight are routinely discarded to ensure that only preparations with
no evidence of the development of oedema in any part of the lung
tissue are included in the results.
experiments to measure deamination of 3h-noradrenaline in ra~
lungs. aduit, male, specific pathogen-free, wistar rats (185-250 g)
were anaesthetized with 60 mg/kg pentobarbitone sodium intraperitoneally and the lung preparations were dissected as described
previously (westwood et al. 1996). the lungs were initially perfused
via the puimonary artery at 37 ° c and a flow rate of 10 ml/min for
20 rain with krebs soiution containing 5% bovine  xxxg124xxx ,
10 ~mol/1 u-0521 and, where appropriate, 10, 30 or 300 nmol/1
amezinium or 30, 300 or 3000 nmol/l  xxxd1818xxx . in some experiments, 100 nmol/1 lazabemide was included to inhibit mao-b
(westwood and bryan-lluka 1993). the lungs were then perfused at
37 ° c for 20 rain with aerated (95% o2 and 5% co2) krebs solution
containing 1 nmol/1 3h-noradrenaline pius the same drugs as above,
but no bovine  xxxg124xxx . during the perfusion with 3h-noradrenaline, samples of perfusion solution were collected from the
cannula in the left atrium (venous effluent) from 4.5-5.5, 9.5-10.5,
14.5 15.5, 16.5-17.5 and 18.5 19.5 rain. at the end of each experiment, the preparation was removed from the ventilation chamber
and treated as described previously (bryan and o'donnell 1991) and
an arterial sample (i.e. perfusion solution from the pulmonary artery
cannula) was coliected. venous effluent, arterial and lung
homogenate supernatant samples were taken a) for liquid scintillation counting to measure 3h and b) for column chromatographic
separation of noradrenaline from its deaminated metabolites,

538
d o p e g and doma, (graefe et al. 1973; trendelenburg et al. 1983)
and subsequent liquid scintillation counting. the perfusion pressure
of the lungs was measured throughout the experiments (0.53-2 kpa)
and the lung weight at the end of each experiment was expressed as
a percentage of the body weight (0.42-0.66%) to monitor the viability of the lungs.

stock solutions of desipramine,  xxxd2398xxx  and noradrenaline
(10retool/i) were prepared in 10mmol/l hydrochloric acid, of
lazabemide and u-0521 (1 mmol/1) in krebs or tyrode solutions as
appropriate and of amezinium (1 mmol/1),  xxxd1818xxx  (1 mmol/1)
and  xxxd3229xxx  (1 mol/1) in water. all dilutions were prepared in
krebs or tyrode solution as appropriate.

experiments to measure uptake2 of  xxxd2398xxx  in rat hearts. adult,
male, specific pathogen-free, wistar rats (185-225 g) were injected
with 5000 u/kg  xxxd2267xxx  intraperitoneally 20 rain prior to
sacrifice by cervical dislocation and exsanguination. the hearts were
removed and initially perfused by the langendorff technique with
tyrode solution containing 10 ~.tmol/1u-0521 and, in some experiments, 0.1, 1 or 30 ~tmol/1 amezinium or 30 gmol/1  xxxd1818xxx  at
36.5°c and a flow rate of about 10ml.g-~.min -~ (range
8.6 10.6 ml.g- ~.min- 1) for 20 rain. the tyrode solution contained
(in retool/l) :  xxxg2020xxx  137, kc1 2.7, cac12 1.3, nah2po4 0.4, mgc12
1.05, nahco3 11.9, glucose 5.0,  xxxd228xxx  0.30 and na2edta
0.040 and was aerated with 95% 02 and 5% co2. the perfusion
pressure ranged from 5-8 kpa. 3h- xxxd2398xxx  (25 nmol/1) and 14csorbitol (100 gmol/1) were then added to the above perfusion solution for a further 2 min of perfusion. at the end of each experiment,
the preparation was removed from the cannula and treated as
described previously and an arterial sample was collected (bryan et
al. 1986). arterial and heart homogenate snpernatant samples were
taken for liquid scintillation counting to measure 3h and ~4c.

calculation of results. in efflux experiments, the rate of efflux of

experiments to measure extraneuronal deamination of 3h-noradrenaline in rat hearts. adult, male, specific pathogen-free, wistar rats

(195-235 g) were pretreated with 1 mg/kg reserpine intraperitoneally
18 h prior to the experiment to inhibit uptake of noradrenaline into
the synaptic vesicles. the rats were then treated with heparin and the
heart preparations were dissected and perfused as described above.
the hearts were initially perfused with tyrode solution containing
1 pmol/1 desipramine to inhibit uptake1 into noradrenergic neurones, 10 gmol/l u-0521 and, in some experiments, 10 or 300 nmol/1
amezinium at 36.5°c and a flow rate of about 10 ml.g-1.rain-1
(range 8.9-11.2 ml.g ~.min -~) for 20 rain. the perfusion pressure
ranged from 4-8 kpa. 3h-noradrenaline (10 nmol/1) was then added
to the above perfusion solution for a further 30 rain of perfusion.
during the perfusion with 3h-noradrenaline, samples of perfusion
solution were collected from a hole cut in the pulmonary artery close
to the right ventricle (venous effluent) from 4.5-5.5, 14.5-15.5,
24.5-25.5, 26.5 27.5 and 28.5 29.5 min. at the end of each experiment, the preparation was treated as described above and venous
effluent, arterial and heart homogenate supernatant samples were
taken for liquid scintillation counting and column chromatographic
separation of noradrenaline, d o p e g and doma as described
above.
drugs and solutions. the drugs used were: desipramine hydrochloride (sigma chemical company, st louis, mo., usa); 3',4'-

dihydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone (u-0521; upjohn pty ltd,
kalamazoo, mich., usa);  xxxd2267xxx  (as vials of 5000 u/ml;
commonwealth serum laboratories ltd, parkville, australia);
( +)- xxxd2398xxx  sulphate (sigma); (+)-[7-3h]- xxxd2398xxx 
(amersham pty ltd, amersham, uk; 150 bq/pmol, purified over
alumina before use); lazabemide (ro19-6327; hoffmann-la roche
ltd, basel, switzerland); (-)-noradrenaline bitartrate (sigma);
( - )-[7-3h]-noradrenaline (new england nuclear; approximately
500 bq/pmol, purified over alumina before use);  xxxd2850xxx  hydrochloride (sigma; administered as a 92.5 mg/ml solution in normal
saline); pentobarbitone sodium (as nembutal vials of 60 mg/ml;
bomac pty ltd., sydney, australia); reserpine (sigma; administered
as a 5 mg/ml solution in a 4:1 mixture of 20%  xxxd228xxx  and
ethanol);  xxxd3229xxx  (sigma); d-[14c]-sorbitoi (amersham;
12 bq/pmol, diluted with unlabelled sorbitol to the desired specific
activity; the final concentration of 14c-sorbitol was 62 nmol/1. bovine  xxxg124xxx  (cohn fraction v, 98-99% albumin) was obtained from sigma (catalogue no. a7906).

3h-noradrenaline from the lungs for each venous effluent sample
and the 3h-noradrenaline content of the lungs at the end of the
experiment were calculated as described previously (westwood et al.
1996). values for the fractional rate of loss (frl) of 3h-noradrenaline, which is an instantaneous measure of ko~t na, the rate constant
for efflux of noradrenaline from the lungs (graefe and b6nisch 1988),
were then calculated over the entire efflux period as described
previously (westwood et al. 1996).
in experiments to measure uptak% of  xxxd2398xxx  in rat hearts,
initial rates of uptake were calculated as the 3h- xxxd2398xxx  content
of the heart, corrected for its distribution in the extracellular space
(ecs), divided by the perfusion time (2 min), corrected for the time
to clear the dead volume of the apparatus. the ecs, calculated from
the 14c-sorbitol content of each heart, was 0.329 + 0.006 (n = 30)
for the experiments in the study and was unaffected by amezinium or
 xxxd1818xxx .
in metabolism experiments with rat lungs or hearts, rates of
d o p e g and doma appearance in the venous effluent were calculated. steady-state rates (v~t-~t) of 3h-dopeg formation were
calculated as the mean of the normalized rates of appearance of the
corresponding metabolite fraction in the venous effluent from
17-19 min of perfusion with 3h-noradrenaline in lungs and from
25-29 min in hearts. since the rate of appearance of doma in the
venous effluent did not reach steady state within the perfusion
period, vst-st values for 3h-doma were calculated from the total
formation of 3h-doma (grohmann 1987). values for t/mna in the
lungs and hearts were calculated as:
tissue amine content (pmol/g)
medium amine concentration (pmol/ml)

ecs

1 - ecs
the ecs in rat lungs was determined as 0.461 and that in rat hearts
as 0.365 in separate series of experiments under the same experimental conditions (bryan et al. 1983; bryan-lluka and o'donnell
1992). values for the rate constant for deamination (kmao),which is a
measure of the activity of mao, were then calculated as vs,-st for
3h-dopeg + 3h-doma formation divided by the product of
t/mna and the 3h-noradrenaline concentration in the perfusion
solution.
results are expressed as arithmetic means _+ se, except t/mna
ratios and kmaovalues which are expressed as geometric means with
95 % confidence limits. the significance of differences between mean
values was assessed by student's t-test on absolute or log values,
depending on whether arithmetic or geometric means, respectively,
were calculated. the paired t-test was used where appropriate and
this is indicated in the text. when multiple comparisons were involved, the data were analyzed by analysis of variance (snedecor and
cochran 1989) and post hoc t-tests by the tukey-kramer method
(using instat software, graphpad software, san diego, ca, usa).

shows that efflux of 3h-noradrenaline from the lungs
had reached steady state (i.e. constant frl or rate
constant for efflux) by 15 min of efflux. the peak increases in frl by 1 gmol/1 amezinium (0.0153
-t-0.0014 min -1) and 15 lamol/l  xxxd1818xxx  (0.0170
+ 0.0021 min-1) were not significantly different from
each other (p > 0.05; student's t-test) and were reduced
by 70% and 67%, respectively, by 1 gmol/1 desipramine. these results show that both amezinium and
 xxxd1818xxx  are substrates of uptakel in rat lungs.

effects of amezinium and  xxxd1818xxx  on deamination
of 3h-noradrenaline in rat lungs
perfusion solution for the last 15 min of the 30 min
period of efflux of 3h-noradrenaline from rat lungs.
the concentrations of amezinium and  xxxd1818xxx 
were 15 times greater than their icso values for inhibition of uptake1 in the lungs (bryan-lluka et al. 1992).
amezinium caused a marked increase in the frl of
3h-noradrenaline (fig. 1a), which reached a maximum
by the first or second min after the addition of the drug
to the perfusion solution, but its effect was reduced
when 1 ~tmol/1 desipramine was present to inhibit uptake1 throughout the effiux period (fig. 1b). similarly,
 xxxd1818xxx  caused a marked increase in the frl of
3h-noradrenaline (fig. 1c), which reached a maximum
by the first to third rain after the addition of the drug in
individual experiments, and its effect was reduced when
desipramine was present throughout efflux (fig. 1d).
the peak increase in frl was determined in each
experiment as the difference between the frl value at
the peak for that experiment (at 16, 17 or 18 min of
efflux) and that just prior to the addition of krebs
solution (controls), amezinium or  xxxd1818xxx . the
lack of any significant change in frl in the controls in
the absence (0.00002 + 0.00033 rain 1) and in the presence ( - 0.00018 _+ 0.00027 rain-l) of desipramine

in lungs perfused with 1 nmol/l 3h-noradrenaline and
with c o m t inhibited, 30 and 300 nmol/1 amezinium,
but not 10 nmol/1, caused significant reductions in the
steady-state rates of formation of the deaminated
metabolites, d o p e g and d o m a (table 1). the
t/mna values measured in the same experiments
showed that there was an increase in accumulation of
unchanged 3h-noradrenaline in the lungs, compared
with controls (no amezinium), when 10 or 30 nmol/1
amezinium was present. hence, the activity of mao,
determined as kmaovalues from these data (table 1),
showed that even 10nmol/1 amezinium caused 58%
inhibition of mao, and its lack of effect on the steadystate rates of formation of d o p e g and d o m a was
due to the marked increase in accumulation of noradrenaline in the lungs when mao was inhibited. at
30 nmol/1, amezinium caused 76% inhibition of mao,
as calculated from kmao values (table 1). a further
increase to 300 nmol/1 amezinium caused a significant
reduction in the t/mnavalues compared with controls
and with either of the lower amezinium concentrations
(table 1) and no further reduction in the activity of
mao (inhibited by 74%).

further experiments were carried out to determine
whether amezinium had a selective effect on mao-a.
lungs were perfused with 1 nmol/1 3h-noradrenaline
with both c o m t and mao-b inhibited. the results in
table 2 show that 10 nmol/1 amezinium caused a significant reduction in the steady-state rates of formation of
d o p e g and doma, a marked increase in the t/mna
and, hence, a marked reduction in the activity of  xxxg1357xxx  by 84%.
in lungs perfused with 1 nmol/1 3h-noradrenaline
and with c o m t inhibited, 300 and 3000 nmol/1  xxxd1818xxx  caused significant reductions in the steadystate rates of formation of d o p e g and d o m a and
30 nmol/1  xxxd1818xxx  significantly reduced that of
d o m a (table 3). the t/mna values measured in the
same experiments showed that there was an increase in
accumulation of unchanged 3h-noradrenaline in the
lungs, compared with controls (no  xxxd1818xxx ), at
each of the concentrations of  xxxd1818xxx  used, but

the t / m n a reached a peak and was significantly lower
at 3000 nmol/1 than at 300 nmol/1  xxxd1818xxx  (table
3). the values for the activity of mao determined from
these data (table 3) showed that mao was inhibited
by 56%, 89% and 96% in the presence of 30, 300 and
3000 nmol/1  xxxd1818xxx , respectively.
effects of amezinium and  xxxd1818xxx  on uptake2
of 3h- xxxd2398xxx  in rat hearts
amezinium, at concentrations of 0.1 and 1 pmol/1, had
no effects on the rate of uptake2 of  xxxd2398xxx  in rat
hearts perfused with 25 nmol/1 3h- xxxd2398xxx , but
uptake2 was reduced by 37% when the concentration
of amezinium was increased to 30 ~tmol/1 (fig. 2).  xxxd1818xxx  was tested at only one concentration,
30 gmol/1, which resulted in 60% inhibition of uptake2
(fig. 2).

effects of amezinium on extrancuronal dcamination
of 3h-noradrenaline in rat hearts
in rat hearts perfused with l0 nmol/1 3h-noradrenaline
and with comt, uptakel and vesicular transport inhibited so that the only fate of the noradrenaline was
extraneuronal uptake and deamination, 10nmol/1
amezinium had no effects, but 300 nmol/1 amezinium

the first aim of the study was to show whether or not
the previously demonstrated inhibition of noradrenaline uptake in rat lungs by amezinium and  xxxd1818xxx  (bryan-lluka et al. 1992) was due to their
transport by non-neuronal uptake1 into the pulmonary
endothelial cells. both of these drugs have been shown
to be substrates of neuronal uptake1 in various tissues
(steppeler 1980; traut et al. 1981; langeloh et al. 1987).
we have recently shown that substrates and non-transported inhibitors of uptake1 can be easily distinguished
by their effects on efflux of catecholamines from rat
lungs: transported substrates cause a rapid and marked
increase in the steady-state frl of 3h-noradrenaline
from the lungs, whereas non-transported inhibitors
cause only a small and gradual increase in the steadystate frl of 3h-noradrenaline (westwood et al. 1996).
similar effects of substrates (langeloh et al. 1987) and
inhibitors (b6nisch and rodrigues-pereira 1983) on the
etflux of 3h-noradrenatine have previously been demonstrated in noradrenergic neurones. in this study,
amezinium and  xxxd1818xxx  caused rapid increases in
the frl of 3h-noradrenaline from the lungs, reaching
a peak effect 1-3 min after their addition to the perfusion solution, and these effects were markedly reduced

by the uptake~ inhibitor desipramine. the results of
these efflux experiments showed that amezinium and
 xxxd1818xxx  are substrates that are transported into
the pulmonary endothelial cells by uptake1.
the peak increases in frl of 3h-noradrenaline by
1 ~tmol/1 amezinium and 15 gmol/1  xxxd1818xxx , concentrations that are 15-fold greater than their ics0
values for inhibition of uptake~ in the lungs (bryanlluka et al. 1992), were only about 40% of the peak
increase in 3h-noradrenaline frl by a dopamine concentration of 3 gmol/1 (12-fold greater than its ics0 for
inhibition of uptake~ in rat lungs; bryan-lluka and
o'donnell 1992) in a recent report (westwood et al.
1996). this is consistent with the results obtained in
a study on the effects of substrates on the efflux of
noradrenaline from noradrenergic neurones in rat vas
deferens, in which amezinium and  xxxd1818xxx  were
the least effective and dopamine was one of the most
effective of the twelve substrates, each tested over
a wide concentration range (langeloh et al. 1987).
the explanation given in the latter study for the
relatively small effect of amezinium on efflux of 3 u noradrenaline was that the vmaxfor uptake~ of amezinium in the rat vas deferens is low relative to the other
amines tested, but a vmaxvalue for  xxxd1818xxx  was
not determined in that study. the vmax values of
amezinium and  xxxd1818xxx  have also not been determined in rat lungs, but it is likely that the same explanation for the relatively small releasing effects of
these drugs is valid in the lungs. this explanation is
also consistent with the observation that the decline in
frl after reaching the peak for amezinium and  xxxd1818xxx  (fig. 1) was much less marked than that
observed with dopamine (westwood et al. 1996), at
approximately equivalent concentrations relative to
the k m of the substrates.
the effects of amezinium and  xxxd1818xxx  on the
uptake1 transporter are evident, not only from the
efflux experiments in this study, but also from the
experiments where their effects on deamination of
noradrenaline in the lungs were examined. tables 1 and

3 show that, with increasing concentrations of each of
the drugs, the t/mna values increased due to accumulation of noradrenaline in the cells when mao was
inhibited (see below), but the values reached a maximum and then decreased with further increases in the
amezinium or  xxxd1818xxx  concentrations. the maximal t/mna values reached for both drugs were markedly less than the values of about 70 achieved in experiments in which both mao and c o m t were maximally inhibited by drugs that do not interact with the
uptakel transporter (scarcella and bryan-lluka 1995).
the marked decrease in t / m n a occurred when the
amezinium concentration was increased from 30 to
300 nmol/1, which are, respectively, below and above its
ic50 value of 68 nmol/1 for inhibition of uptake1 in rat
lungs (bryan-lluka et al. 1992). similarly, the decrease
in t/mna for the  xxxd1818xxx  experiments occurred
between 300 and 3000 nmol/1, which are, respectively,
below and above its icso value of 980 nmol/1 for inhibition of uptake~ in rat lungs (bryan-lluka et al. 1992).
these results are consistent with inhibition of uptake1
being the explanation for the decrease in the t/mna
values at the higher concentrations of amezinium and
 xxxd1818xxx  in these experiments.
the mao inhibitory effects of amezinium and  xxxd1818xxx  were determined by measuring the activity
of mao (kmao) for deamination of noradrenaline in
intact perfused lungs in the absence and presence of
a range of concentrations of each drug. the results
showed that 10 nmol/1 amezinium caused more than
50% inhibition of noradrenaline deamination and its
effects reached a plateau of about 75% inhibition at
a concentration of 30 nmol/1. these results are consistent with the conclusion that, over the concentration
range of 10-300nmol/1, amezinium inhibits only
mao-a in the lungs, since we have previously shown
that mao-a is responsible for 67-79% of the
deamination of noradrenaline at non-saturating concentrations in rat lungs (westwood and bryan-lluka
1993). the remaining 25% of the noradrenaline
deamination that was not inhibited by amezinium in

543
the present study would appear to represent metabolism of noradrenaline by mao-b. this was confirmed
by showing that 10 nmol/1 amezinium caused 84%
inhibition of deamination of noradrenaline in lungs
with mao-b inhibited, in contrast with only 58%
inhibition of deamination at this concentration of
amezinium when mao-b was not inhibited. these
results show that, due to accumulation of the drug in
the pulmonary endothelial cells by non-neuronal uptake1, amezinium has about 1000 times greater mao
inhibitory potency in the intact lungs than has been
shown previously in rat tissue homogenates (traut et
al. 1981). in contrast, the selective mao-a inhibitor,
ro41-1049, which does not interact with uptake~
(westwood and bryan-lluka 1993), has been shown to
have a very similar mao-a inhibitory potency in intact tissues, including rat vas deferens and lungs (westwood and bryan-lluka 1993), to that in tissue
homogenates (da prada et al. 1990). the results from
the present study are also consistent with the 100-fold
selectivity of amezinium for mao-a compared with
mao-b that has been demonstrated in rat tissue
homogenates (traut et al. 1981).
in the intact lungs,  xxxd1818xxx  was about 3-fold
less potent than amezinium as an inhibitor of deamination of noradrenaline, despite the 6-fold greater potency of  xxxd1818xxx  than amezinium in tissue
homogenates (traut et al. 1981; javors et al. 1989).
 xxxd1818xxx  was more potent as a mao inhibitor in
the lungs (present study) than in tissue homogenates
(javors et al. 1989), suggesting accumulation of the
drug in the pulmonary endothelial cells by uptake1, but
this effect was much less marked than for amezinium.
in contrast with amezinium, there was no  xxxd1818xxx -resistant component of noradrenaline
deamination in the lungs and virtually complete inhibition of deamination occurred when 3000 nmol/1  xxxd1818xxx  was present (table 3). this result suggests
that  xxxd1818xxx  inhibited both mao-a and mao-b
in the lungs at the concentrations used and again this is
consistent with the much lower mao-a selectivity of
 xxxd1818xxx  (about 18-fold; javors et al. 1989) than of
amezinium (100-fold; traut et al. 1981) in tissue
homogenates.
the results obtained in experiments to determine
the effects of amezinium on uptak% in the rat heart are
consistent with previous brief reports (lenke et al.
1981; steppeler 1981) and show that the drug is more
than 400-fold selective for uptake1 relative to uptake2
(by comparison of its icso in rat lungs (bryan-lluka et
al. 1992) with the results in fig. 2 for rat heart). on the
other hand, a similar comparison for  xxxd1818xxx 
showed that it has less than 30-fold selectivity for
uptake~ relative to uptake2. in view of a) the very
marked selectivity of amezinium for uptakes, b) the
conclusion that its high potency as a mao inhibitor in
some intact tissues is due to accumulation of the drug
by uptake~ in noradrenergic neurones (steppeler et al.

1980; lenke et al. 1981; traut et al. 1981) or pulmonary
endothelial cells (see above) and c) the selectivity of
amezinium for mao-a (see above), experiments similar to those in the lungs were carried out in the rat
heart. the conditions of the experiments in the heart
were such that noradrenaline and amezinium had access via uptake2, and not uptake1, to mao, which is
predominantly of the mao-a form in this preparation
(edwards et al. 1979; saura et al. 1992). the results
showed that the potency of amezinium as a mao
inhibitor was much less in the myocardial cells of the
rat heart than in the endothelial cells of rat lungs, in
that amezinium  xxxd1891xxx  nmol/1, a concentration that
caused 84% inhibition of noradrenaline deamination
by mao-a in the lungs, had no effect on noradrenaline
deamination in the heart. even at 300 nmol/1 amezinium, there was only 36% inhibition of deamination in
the heart. hence, under these conditions, amezinium
was only about one order of magnitude more potent as
a mao inhibitor in the intact tissue than in
homogenates of rat heart (ics0 4 ~tmol/1 for inhibition
of mao-a; traut et al. 1981) and this is in agreement
with the results of a previous study (steppeler and
starke 1980). the markedly different mao inhibitory
potencies of amezinium in tissues with the uptake1 and
uptake2 transporters for noradrenaline are consistent
with the view that amezinium is a very potent mao
inhibitor only in those cell types where amezinium can
accumulate in the cells after transport by uptakes.
nevertheless, there does appear to be some accumulation of amezinium by the uptak% transporter and this
is responsible for its slightly higher potency as a mao
inhibitor in cells with uptake 2 than in tissue
homogenates.
in conclusion, the study has demonstrated that, for
inhibition of mao, amezinium is about 1000 times
more potent and  xxxd1818xxx  is about 20 times more
potent in rat lungs than in tissue homogenates, and that
both of these drugs are substrates for the non-neuronal
uptake~ in the lungs. amezinium is not only a selective
neuronal mao inhibitor as has been previously reported, but this study has shown that it is also a very
potent mao inhibitor in non-neuronal cells that have
the uptake1 transporter, such as the pulmonary endothelial cells. the study has shown that both amezinium
and  xxxd1818xxx  could have a marked inhibitory effect
on dissipation of catecholamines in the pulmonary
circulation, by accumulating in the pulmonary endothelial cells and inhibiting mao at very low circulating
concentrations and by inhibiting uptake~ at higher
concentrations. hence, these drugs could decrease the
removal of catecholamines from the pulmonary circulation and this could contribute to the antihypotensive
effects of amezinium. in addition, the results are consistent with the suggestion that the lungs could act as
a significant site of removal of amezinium and  xxxd1818xxx  from the circulation by accumulating in the
pulmonary endothelial cells.
