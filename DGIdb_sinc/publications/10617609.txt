 xxxg752xxx  (fix)1 is a  xxxg745xxx  precursor that participates in the process of blood coagulation (1, 2). the fix proenzyme is synthesized in the liver and expressed as a single chain
protein (3). fix is converted into the active enzyme factor ixa
(fixa) by proteolytic cleavage by factor xia (fxia) and a factor
viia- xxxg748xxx  complex (1, 4, 5). cleavage of fix occurs at
two distinct sites resulting in the release of the activation
peptide and formation of the 45-kda enzyme fixa. fixa is
composed of an n-terminal light chain and a c-terminal heavy
chain. the light chain consists of the gla domain, which is

enriched in  xxxd1246xxx  residues, followed by a
short hydrophobic stack and two  xxxg681xxx 
(egf)-like domains (denoted as egf1 and egf2 domain). the
heavy chain comprises the protease domain with the catalytic
center (3).
fixa functions as activator of the zymogen  xxxg741xxx  (fx).
activation of fx by fixa is enhanced by several orders of
magnitude in the presence of phospholipid membrane, ca21
ions, and the cofactor, activated factor viii (fviiia) (2, 6, 7).
factor viii ( xxxg751xxx ) is a heterodimer consisting of a light chain
and a heavy chain.  xxxg751xxx  is activated upon cleavage of the
heavy and light chain by thrombin or activated fx ( xxxg741xxx ) (8).
the activated forms of  xxxg751xxx  and fix are known to assemble
into the fx-activating complex (for review see refs. 9 –11). in
the fixa protease domain, regions 301–303 and 333–339 have
been identified as potential binding sites for fviiia (12, 13).
most likely, these sites are involved in the binding of the  xxxg751xxx 
heavy chain (10).
the crystal structure of porcine fixa revealed that the relative orientation of the egf-like domains is fixed by a variety
of contacts between residues located at the interface between
the egf1 and egf2 domain (14). the egf-like domains define
an angle of 110° (14), and this particular orientation may be of
importance for fixa function. this view is supported by the
observation that disruption of a salt bridge between glu78 in
the egf1 domain and arg94 in the egf2 domain is associated
with strongly reduced fviiia-dependent fx activation by fixa
and decreased affinity of fixa for  xxxg751xxx  light chain (15). these
results provide support to the idea that the specific orientation
of both egf-like domains is a prerequisite for proper interaction between fixa and fviiia and that residues near glu78
and arg94 may be involved in a direct interaction with fviiia.
the structure of the interface between the egf-like domains of
porcine fixa is further characterized by the presence of an
exposed hydrophobic site in the egf1 domain, comprising residues val75-phe77, that is captured in a hydrophobic pocket
formed by multiple residues, including val107 and cys109 in the
egf2 domain (14).
in this study, we focused on the functional role of the regions
phe75-gly76-phe77 and lys106-val107-val108 in human fix. in
our approach, we constructed recombinant fix mutants in
which these regions were replaced for corresponding regions of
homologous serine proteases fx and fvii. our results demonstrate that substitution of the fix residues predominantly
affects fixa enzymatic activity and the extent of stimulation
by its natural cofactor, fviiia. our data support a model in
which residues 75, 76, 107, and 108 form a hydrophobic contact
between the egf1 and egf2 domain that is essential for fixa
function.

the three-dimensional structure of activated  xxxg752xxx 
comprises multiple contacts between the two epidermal
growth factor (egf)-like domains. one of these is a salt
bridge between glu78 and arg94, which is essential for
binding of factor ixa to its cofactor factor viii and for
factor viii-dependent  xxxg741xxx  activation (christophe,
o. d., lenting, p. j., kolkman, j. a., brownlee, g. g., and
mertens, k. (1998) j. biol. chem. 273, 222–227). we now
addressed the putative hydrophobic contact at the interface between the egf-like domains. recombinant
 xxxg752xxx  chimeras were constructed in which hydrophobic regions phe75-phe77 and lys106-val108 were replaced by the corresponding sites of  xxxg741xxx  and factor
vii. activated  xxxg752xxx / xxxg741xxx  chimeras were indistinguishable from normal factor ixa with respect to factor
ixa enzymatic activity. in contrast, factor ixa75–77/factor
vii displayed ;2-fold increased  xxxg741xxx  activation in
the presence of factor viii, suggesting that residues
75–77 contribute to cofactor-dependent  xxxg741xxx  activation. activation of  xxxg741xxx  by factor ix106 –108/ xxxg750xxx 
was strongly decreased, both in the absence and presence of factor viii. activity could be restored by simultaneous substitution of the hydrophobic sites in both
egf-like domains for  xxxg750xxx  residues. these data
suggest that factor ixa enzymatic activity requires hydrophobic contact between the two egf-like domains.

experimental procedures

mm nacl, 5 mm cacl2, and 50 mm tris (ph 7.4) for 2 h. activation was
stopped by the addition of edta (10 mm) and  xxxd302xxx  (10 mm).
fixa was loaded on q-sepharose and washed with 150 mm nacl, 5 mm
 xxxd302xxx , and 50 mm tris (ph 7.4) to remove fxia. fixa was eluted
from the column by the addition of 500 mm nacl, 5 mm  xxxd302xxx ,
and 50 mm tris (ph 7.4). fixa preparations were dialyzed against 100
mm nacl, 5% glycerol, 50 mm tris (ph 7.4), and subsequently against
the same buffer containing 50% glycerol. final fixa preparations were
stored at 220 °c.
protein concentrations—the amount of protein was quantified by
the method of bradford (24) using human  xxxg124xxx  as a standard.
 xxxg751xxx  activity was assayed by a spectrophotometric assay employing
bovine coagulation factors and a chromogenic substrate specific for  xxxg741xxx 
(coatest  xxxg751xxx , chromogenix, mölndal, sweden). one unit of  xxxg751xxx 
activity was assumed to correspond to 0.35 nm and represents the
amount of  xxxg751xxx  activity present in 1 ml of pooled normal plasma. fixa
concentrations were determined by active site titration employing antithrombin as the active site titrant and ch3so2-lgr-pna as chromogenic substrate (20). plots of the fixa activity versus the antithrombin
concentration were linear for all fixa variants.
amidolytic activity—hydrolysis of ch3so2-lgr-pna was assayed
as described previously (23). briefly, 50 ml of a 5 mm solution of
ch3so2-lgr-pna was added to 50 ml of a solution containing 300 nm
fixa and various concentrations of cacl2 in a microtiter plate (corning
costar, badhoevedorp, the netherlands). initial rates of substrate
hydrolysis were measured by monitoring the absorbance at 405 nm in
time. absorbance values were converted into molar concentrations using a molar extinction coefficient of 9.65 3 103 m21 cm21 for p-nitroanilide and a path length of 0.35 cm for a 100-ml volume.
fx activation—in the absence of fviiia, fx activation was assayed
as described previously (15) with the exception that pefachrome xa was
used as substrate. in experiments using  xxxg751xxx  (0 –1.5 nm), unactivated
 xxxg751xxx  was activated by 5 nm thrombin in 100 mm nacl, 2 mm cacl2, 0.2
mg/ml ovalbumin, and 50 mm tris (ph 7.4) for 0.5 min at 37 °c.
preliminary experiments revealed that maximal activity of fviiia was
reached after 0.5 min of activation by thrombin. the reaction was
stopped by the addition of hirudin (10 units/ml), and fviiia was added
to siliconized tubes containing preincubated phospholipid vesicles (0.1
mm, l-a- xxxd1857xxx :l-a-phosphatidylcholine, 50:50), cacl2
(5 mm), fixa (0.1 nm), 100 mm nacl, 0.2 mg/ml ovalbumin, and 50 mm
tris (ph 7.4). the reaction was initiated by the addition of fx (0.2 mm).
the amount of  xxxg741xxx  generated was quantified as described previously
(25). the same procedure was followed for assessing fx activation in
the absence of phospholipids, except fviiia, fixa, and fx were increased and  xxxg741xxx  formation was allowed to proceed for 30 min before
terminating the reaction with edta.
results

recombinant fix variants—in the present study, we have
investigated the functional role of hydrophobic residues that
are located at the interface between the egf1 and egf2 domain in the fixa light chain. to this end, recombinant fix
variants were constructed in which residues were replaced by
corresponding residues of fx and fvii. substitutions were
based upon alignment of the human fix and human fvii
sequences and the position of the hydrophobic residues in a
three-dimensional structure of human fix based on the crystal
structure of porcine fixa (14) (fig. 1). this analysis revealed
that in the egf1 domain a hydrophobic loop, comprising residues phe75, gly76, and phe77, is positioned opposite of hydrophobic residues val107, val108, and lys106 in the egf2 domain.
two fix chimeras were constructed in which the separate sites
in the egf1 domain and the egf2 domain were replaced by
corresponding residues of fx, whereas a third chimera comprised a combination of these replacements. the same procedure was used for construction of fix/fvii chimeras. in addition to these chimeric variants, one fix variant was
constructed in which phe77 was substituted for ser77. residue
phe77 is conserved both in fx and fvii, and phe77 3 ser
mutation has been reported to be associated with mild  xxxg752xxx  (28). recombinant fix variants and wt-fix were
expressed in madin-darby canine kidney cells and purified
from conditioned medium by immunoaffinity chromatography

(asnières, france). the thermo sequenase cycle sequencing kit was
obtained from amersham pharmacia biotech. purified antithrombin
and human  xxxg124xxx  were obtained from the division of products
of clb (amsterdam, the netherlands).
construction of recombinant fix—the plasmid encoding wild-type
fix (wt-fix) has been described previously (16). site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the plasmid encoding wt-fix as a template to construct plasmids coding for fix75–77/fx, fix106 –108/fx,
fix75–77/fvii, fix106 –108/fvii, and fix-phe77 3 ser. plasmids were
constructed using the overlap extension polymerase chain reaction
mutagenesis method (17). plasmids encoding fix75–77/fx and fix75–77/
fvii were used as template in the polymerase chain reactions for
construction of plasmids encoding fix75–77, 106 –108/fx and fix75–77,
106 –108
/fvii, respectively. sequence analysis was performed to verify
the presence of the mutations in the plasmids.
proteins—monoclonal antibody clb-fix 14 and polyclonal antibodies against fix have been described (18). antibodies were purified
employing protein a-sepharose as recommended by the manufacturer.
fix, fx, and prothrombin were purified from a concentrate of human
prothrombin, fix, and fx (7, 19) and converted into their active forms
(fixa,  xxxg741xxx , and thrombin, respectively) as described (19, 20). human
 xxxg751xxx  was purified as described previously (20).  xxxg751xxx  was activated by
thrombin (molar ratio 30:1) for 10 min, and activated fviiia was
purified by cm-sepharose according to a previously described method
(21). purified fviiia preparations were obtained with a specific procoagulant activity of .100,000 units/mg, as determined in the one-stage
clotting assay (22). final fviiia preparations were stored at 280 °c.
expression and culturing of fix variants—recombinant fix was
expressed in madine-darby canine kidney cells as described previously
(15). cells were transfected with plasmid dna employing the calcium
precipitation method as outlined previously (16) and grown in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum,
100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. after 2 days,
 xxxd2191xxx  (800 mg/ml) was added to the medium for selection of transfected cells. after 2 weeks, individual clones were isolated and grown in
selective medium to obtain stable cell lines. production of fix was
monitored by measuring fix antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay as described previously (20). stable cell lines producing appropriate amounts of fix were selected and used for large scale production of
fix in cell factories (6320 cm2). medium (dulbecco’s modified eagle’s
medium, supplemented with 2.5% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 5 mg/ml  xxxd2941xxx   xxxd3522xxx , 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 1 mg/ml  xxxd164xxx , and 0.8 mg/ml desoxycholate) containing secreted fix was harvested three times a week and stored at 220 °c.
purification of recombinant fix variants—cultured medium was
filtered through a 0.22 mm membrane (plasmaflux p1, fresenius, bad
homburg, germany) to remove cell debris. wt-fix and fix mutants
were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using monoclonal
antibody clb-fix 14 according to an established procedure (12, 15, 23).
after purification, one single fix band for all fix variants was present
after sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by coomassie
brilliant blue staining. fix mutants displayed the same electrophoretic mobility as purified plasma-derived fix, indicating that no
propeptide-containing unprocessed fix was present. recombinant fix
produced by this expression system is indistinguishable from plasmaderived fix with regard to binding to barium citrate and to the ca21dependent monoclonal antibody clb-fix 2 (23). furthermore, ca21dependent activity of wt-fixa toward a synthetic substrate and toward
fx is similar to that of plasma-derived factor ixa (15, 16, 23). fix was
converted into fixa by incubation of 1.4 mm fix with 7 nm fxia in 100

hydrophobic contact between the  xxxg752xxx  egf-like domains

(see “experimental procedures”). all mutants were activated
by fxia under conditions similar to those for wt-fix and plasma-derived fixa. all fix chimeras could be completely converted into the active form, fixa (data not shown). the concentration of active fixa in the purified preparations was
determined by active site titration using antithrombin.
amidolytic activity—the egf1 domain of fixa contains a
high affinity ca21 binding site. binding of ca21 to this site has
been demonstrated to modulate activity of fixa toward a small
synthetic substrate (23). to investigate the potential role of the
amino acid replacements in the fixa light chain on amidolytic
activity, fixa variants were tested employing the synthetic
substrate ch3-so2-lgr-pna. all fixa chimeras tested were
indistinguishable from plasma-derived fixa with respect to
ca21-dependent stimulation of substrate hydrolysis, displaying rates of substrate hydrolysis between 2.5 and 2.7 mm pnitroanilide/min in the presence of 5 mm cacl2. apparently, the
various amino acid substitutions in the egf1 and egf2 domain leave fixa amidolytic activity unaffected.
fx activation in the absence of fviiia—subsequently, enzymatic activity of the fixa chimeras toward the macromolecular substrate fx was explored. activation of fx by fixa was
investigated in the presence of phospholipids and ca21 ions but
in the absence of fviiia. most fixa chimeras displayed normal
(fixa/fx chimeras, fixa75–77/fvii) or slightly reduced (fixaphe77 3 ser) fx activation (fig. 2 and table i). apparently,
substitution of residues phe75, gly76, and lys106 for corresponding residues of fx and fvii does not affect fixa enzymatic activity toward fx, whereas substitution of phe77 3 ser
has only a minor effect. in contrast, fx activation by fixa106 –
108
/fvii was strongly reduced. this was mainly because of a
decrease in the apparent catalytic rate constant (kcat) resulting
in a 10-fold reduction in the apparent catalytic efficiency (kcat/

fig. 2. activation of fx by fixa chimeras in the absence of
 xxxg751xxx . fx (0 – 400 nm) was incubated with 0.1 mm phospholipids, 5 mm
cacl2, 15 nm of wt-fixa (open circles), fixa75–77/fvii (closed circles),
fixa106 –108/fvii (closed squares), fixa75–77, 106 –108/fvii (closed triangles), and fixa-phe77 3 ser (open triangles) in 100 mm nacl, 0.2 mg/ml
ovalbumin, and 50 mm tris (ph 7.4) for 10 min at 37 °c. activation of
fx by fixa75–77/fx, fixa106 –108/fx, and fixa75–77, 106 –108/fx was similar as observed for wt-fixa. for all fixa variants, kinetic parameters
of fx activation are listed in table i. data represent mean values of two
to four experiments.

km) compared with that of wt-fixa (table i). in view of the
severe defect of fixa106 –108/fx, it is remarkable that activation of fx by fixa75–77, 106 –108/fx proved only a minor reduction compared with normal fixa (fig. 2 and table i). apparently, the deleterious effect caused by substitution of val107 3
arg and val108 3 ser in the egf2 domain is compensated for
by simultaneous substitution of phe75 3 pro and gly76 3 ala
in the egf1 domain.
fx activation in the presence of fviiia—the contribution of
fviiia as cofactor for fixa to the activation of fx was assessed
in a kinetic system containing phospholipids, ca21 ions, fixa,
fx, and various concentrations of fviiia. for wt-fixa, fx
activation was enhanced by fviiia in a dose-dependent manner (fig. 3a). fixa/fx substitution variants were identical to
wt-fixa (fig. 3b). in contrast, fixa/fvii chimeras and fixaphe77 3 ser displayed different cofactor-dependent fx activation. one chimera, fixa75–77/fvii, displayed an increased rate
of fx activation compared with wt-fixa (fig. 3a). the enhanced activity is  xxxg751xxx -dependent, because no elevated activation of fx was observed in the absence of fviiia (fig. 2).
reduced activity was observed for fixa-phe77 3 ser and the
other two fixa/fvii chimeras. like in the absence of fviiia
(fig. 2), fixa75–77, 106 –108/fvii activity was increased compared with that of fixa106 –108/fvii. these data suggest that a
functional interaction exists between residues 75 and 76 in the
egf1 domain, and residues 107 and 108 in the egf2 domain,
which is important for regulation of fixa activity both in the
presence and absence of the cofactor fviiia.
to examine catalytic parameters of fx activation in the
presence of fviiia, various concentrations of fx were incubated with fixa variants in the presence of fviiia and phospholipids. in this experiment, fixa/fx chimeras were not studied in detail, because these chimeras were identical to wt-fixa
with respect to  xxxg751xxx -dependent fx activation (fig. 3b).
fixa75–77/fvii displayed about 2-fold increased activity compared with wt-fixa (fig. 4). the elevation in apparent kcat
(table i) is compatible with fixa75–77/fvii having increased
affinity for fviiia. in agreement with the data shown in fig.
3a, the other two fixa/fvii chimeras and fixa-phe77 3 ser
displayed reduced activation of fx.
fx activation in the absence of phospholipids—recent data
suggest that some fixa variants with mutations in the egf1
domain display strongly reduced  xxxg751xxx -dependent fx activa-

we therefore tested whether the fixa/fvii chimeras and
fixa-phe77 3 ser display the same discrepancy with wt-fixa
in the absence of phospholipids. because of the low conversion
rate of fx in the absence of phospholipids, relatively high

concentrations of fx, fviiia, and fixa were employed. under
these conditions, fixa75–77/fvii stimulated fx activation to a
higher extent compared with wt-fixa (fig. 5). the calculated
apparent kd for the interaction between fviiia and fixa75–77/
fvii was 2-fold lower than the apparent kd for the interaction
with wt-fixa. fixa-phe77 3 ser, fixa106 –108/fvii, and
fixa75–77, 106 –108/fvii displayed less effective stimulation by
fviiia. for all fixa variants the extent of fx activation compared with wt-fixa was similar to that observed in the presence of phospholipids. these results demonstrate that alterations in fixa variants are because of modified enzymatic
properties and not to differences in phospholipid-dependent
enzyme-cofactor or enzyme-substrate complex assembly.
discussion

the serine proteases of the blood coagulation process display
a high level of structural similarity (2, 29). most of these
enzymes comprise a protease domain containing the specific
ser/asp/his catalytic triad and a light chain containing two or
more egf-like domains. egf-like domains have been demonstrated to be important for a number of functional properties,
including ca21 binding and protein-protein interactions (30 –
32). structural data derived from nmr and crystallographic
studies have shed light on the three-dimensional structure of
these domains and the orientation thereof in the complete
protein (14, 31–35). the crystal structure of porcine fixa revealed that multiple interdomain contacts exist between the

hydrophobic contact between the  xxxg752xxx  egf-like domains

egf1 and egf2 domain (14). in the present study, we focused
on hydrophobic contacts between the two egf-like domains
employing recombinant fix/x and fix/vii chimeras (fig. 1).
all of the fixa/fx chimeras we analyzed (table i) displayed
normal enzymatic activity compared with wt-fixa, both in the
absence and presence of fviiia (figs. 2 and 3b). it seems
relevant to note that amino acid replacements in the fixa/fx
chimeras were limited to residues 75 and 106, because residues
76, 77, 107, and 108 are identical in fx (see fig. 1). the
observation that substitution of residues 75 and 106 is not
accompanied by major changes in enzymatic activity suggests
that these residues are not essential for fixa function. the fact
that in the fixa/fx chimeras the majority of the hydrophobic
residues remains unaffected further implies that residues in
position 76, 77, 107, and 108 may be more important in maintaining the hydrophobic contact between the two egf-like
domains.
studies using other chimeric fixa variants have demonstrated that the complete egf1 domain can be replaced by that
of fx without apparent effect on fix function (36). in contrast,
introducing the entire egf1 domain from fvii leads to increased activity in the presence of fviiia, which presumably is
because of an increased affinity for this cofactor (37). in our
study, we observed a rate enhancement for fixa75–77/fvii
similar to that reported for fixaegf1/fvii (fig. 3a). this suggests that the effect of egf1 domain replacement could be fully
explained by the introduction of pro75 and ala76 in the fix
molecule. in this respect, our data are compatible with the
suggestion made by chang et al. (37) that elimination of the
phe75 side chain may increase flexibility between the egf1
and egf2 domains, which might facilitate fviiia binding. an
alternative explanation would be that the sequence pro75ala76-phe77 in fixa75–77/fvii directly binds to fviiia. however, this seems less likely because the presence of the same
residues in the fixa75–77, 106 –108/fvii chimera is not associated with increased response to fviiia (fig. 3a). our finding
that cofactor stimulation is reduced in fixa-phe77 3 ser further supports the role of hydrophobic residues phe75-gly76phe77 in regulation of fviiia-dependent fixa activity (fig. 3).
whereas the functional role of residues 75–77 is relatively

minor, mutation of residues 106 –108 proved to be of major
impact on fixa function. the chimera fixa106 –108/fvii displayed dramatically reduced activity toward fx, both in the
absence (fig. 2) and presence (fig. 3a) of fviiia. because the
defect was not only cofactor-independent but also phospholipidindependent (fig. 5), it is evident that introduction of fvii
residues at positions 107 and 108 in the egf2 domain does not
affect assembly of the fx-activating complex, but that the
defect is because of a decrease in enzymatic activity. this
suggests that a functional link exists between the egf2 domain and the fixa heavy chain. an explanation for the apparent “cross-talk” between the fixa heavy and light chain, may
be derived from the current three-dimensional fixa structures
and the atomic contacts between the two chains therein. indeed, these structures reveal that there is an intimate contact
between the egf2 domain and the heavy chain (14, 38). in this
respect fixa is similar to  xxxg741xxx , wherein the egf2 domain and
the protease domain may be regarded as a single operational
unit (39). although residues 107 and 108 are not in direct
contact with the fixa heavy chain, it is conceivable that substitution of these light chain residues may alter the interdomain interaction via an allosteric mechanism. these structural
alterations in fixa light chain-heavy chain contact may affect
the arrangement of substrate recognition and cleavage sites in
the heavy chain. analysis of the interface between light and
heavy light chain reveals multiple interdomain interactions
including the disulfide bridge between cys132 and cys289, a salt
bridge between glu113 and lys409, hydrophobic contact between phe98 and residues tyr295, phe299, and phe302 (14, 38),
and a potential hydrogen bond between asn92 and tyr295.
interestingly, mutation of asn92 3 his in fix is associated
with reduced fixa enzymatic activity (40), which also might
support our idea that contact between the egf2 domain and
the heavy chain contributes to enzymatic activity.
in view of the assumption that residues 106 –108 may regulate enzymatic activity via contact between light and heavy
chain, it is particularly striking that the detrimental effect of
replacing residues 106 –108 in the egf2 domain is counteracted by the replacement of the complementary hydrophobic
site 75–77. our finding that the fixa75–77, 106 –108/fvii chimera has apparently normal enzymatic activity (figs. 2 and
3a) suggests that these sites comprise a functional link between the two egf-like domains in fixa. as such the hydrophobic contact, which has been described as a “ball-and-socket”
joint in the fixa light chain (14), is the counterpart of the salt
bridge between glu78 and arg94, which also links the egf-like
domains (15). the difference between these contacts, however,
is that the salt bridge supports fviiia binding, whereas the
hydrophobic contact primarily seems to regulate fixa enzymatic activity.
it is further remarkable that substitution of the fix sequence phe75-gly76-phe77 for the fvii sequence pro75-ala76phe77 had no effect on enzymatic activity in the absence of
fviiia (fig. 2). this might imply that the egf1 residues 75–77
may not be involved in regulation of enzymatic activity and
that only residues in the egf2 domain (e.g. residues 92, 107–
108) contribute to fixa enzymatic activity. however, it should
be noted that amino acid replacements in fixa75–77/fvii still
maintain the hydrophobic character of this region. it seems
conceivable therefore, that these fvii residues also are able to
support the hydrophobic interaction with the egf2 domain
and consequently remain without significant effect on the overall structure of the protease domain of this fixa chimera. the
fact that the fixa75–77, 106 –108/fvii chimera displays apparently normal activity further implies that the proteolytic activity is influenced by structure elements in the egf1 domain. a

fvii, respectively. for fixa-phe77 3 ser and fixa106 –108/fvii the
apparent kd was .200 nm.

hydrophobic contact between the  xxxg752xxx  egf-like domains

similar effect has been observed for fixa variants with mutations in position 64 in the egf1 domain (23). mutation at this
site eliminates the high affinity ca21 binding site in this light
chain domain and is associated with a variety of molecular
defects including enzymatic activity toward both fx and a
small synthetic peptide substrate. the role of the light chain in
regulation of fixa activity is further demonstrated by the
observation that fixa amidolytic activity could be completely
inhibited by a monoclonal antibody against the light chain of
fixa (20). although the proposed effects of the amino acid
substitutions on the fixa structure can only be confirmed by
crystallographic data, we propose that the structural integrity
of the interface between both egf-like domains serves as an
allosteric hinge, which regulates proper orientation of light and
heavy chain within the fixa molecule.
