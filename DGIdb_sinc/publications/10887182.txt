hyaluronan is a ubiquitous glycosaminoglycan (gag)1 that
is present in extracellular and pericellular matrices. on the
basis of its unique physical and chemical properties, it has been
well documented that hyaluronan plays a critical role in dynamic structural changes within extracellular matrices during
development and tissue remodeling, as well as in maintenance

of mechanical properties and homeostasis of many tissues (1,
2). interactions of hyaluronan with hyaluronan-binding proteins (habps) are involved in establishing and modifying the
structural properties of extracellular matrices. furthermore, it
is increasingly appreciated that hyaluronan is a crucial pericellular and cell surface component that actively participates in
regulating cell behavior through its interactions with cell surface habps such as cd44 (1– 4). a surprising new development, however, has been the discovery of several intracellular
habps (ihabps), but the interactions and functions of intracellular hyaluronan and ihabps are not yet understood.
convincing studies showing the existence of intracellular
pools of hyaluronan in vivo and in vitro (5– 8) and the discovery
of several ihabps, including cdc37 (9),  xxxg1061xxx / xxxg1061xxx  (10,
11), and p32 (12), have raised an interesting question. does
intracellular hyaluronan, like extracellular hyaluronan, play
an important role in regulating cellular behavior through interactions with ihabps? recently, it was reported that rapid
uptake of texas red-labeled hyaluronan and its subsequent
accumulation in the cell processes, perinuclear area, and nucleus of transformed cells were associated with enhanced cell
motility (13). furthermore, careful examination confirmed the
intracellular localization of endogenous hyaluronan as well as
hyaluronan-binding sites and demonstrated dynamic changes
in their pattern of distribution during proliferation of smooth
muscle cells and fibroblasts (8). these data suggest strongly
that intracellular hyaluronan has important roles in cellular
processes.
using the monoclonal antibody (mab), ivd4, which recognizes a novel group of chick habps (14), we have previously
identified and characterized cdc37, a cell cycle regulatory
protein (9, 15). in the present study, we have characterized a
cdna, lh21, that encodes a second novel chick  xxxg1011xxx  recognized by mab ivd4, using similar strategies as described previously (9, 15). this  xxxg1011xxx , like cdc37, is also an intracellular
protein containing multiple hyaluronan binding motifs, (r/
k)x7(r/k), in which b denotes arginine or lysine and x denotes
any amino acid except glutamic or  xxxd233xxx  (16). furthermore, we have cloned the mouse and human homologs of this
gene; shown that the hyaluronan binding motifs are conserved
among the deduced chick, mouse, and human protein sequences; and demonstrated that the chick and mouse proteins bind
hyaluronan specifically. these results imply that the hyaluronan-binding properties of this protein have functional importance. we have termed this protein  xxxg1012xxx , because three
other ihabps have so far been characterized: cdc37 (9),
 xxxg1061xxx / xxxg1061xxx  (10, 11), and p32 (12).

hyaluronan has well defined functions in extracellular matrices and at the surface of cells. however, several
studies have now shown that significant pools of hyaluronan are also present intracellularly, but its function
therein is unknown. one avenue of investigation that
may assist in defining the function of intracellular hyaluronan is to identify intracellular hyaluronan-binding
proteins. in previous studies we identified cdc37, a cell
cycle regulatory protein, using a monoclonal antibody
that recognizes a novel group of hyaluronan-binding
proteins. in this study, we have identified a second hyaluronan-binding protein with this antibody and characterized its properties. this protein, which we have
termed  xxxg1012xxx , was also found to be an intracellular
and a specific hyaluronan-binding protein, containing
several hyaluronan-binding motifs: (r/k)x7(r/k) (where
r/k denotes arginine or lysine and x denotes non-acidic
amino acids). furthermore, we have determined the
gene organization of  xxxg1012xxx  and cloned cdnas for the
chick, mouse, and human homologs. comparison of the
deduced chick, mouse, and human protein sequences
showed that the hyaluronan-binding motifs, (r/k)x7(r/
k), in these sequences are conserved; both chick and
mouse  xxxg1012xxx  were shown directly to bind hyaluronan.
biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescent localization of epitope-tagged  xxxg1012xxx  indicated that it is
mainly present in the cytoplasm. these data support the
possibility that intracellular hyaluronan and its binding
proteins may play important roles in cell behavior.

novel intracellular hyaluronan-binding protein
confirmation, all inserts were cut out of the pcrii vector and subcloned
into a mammalian expression vector, pci-neo (promega). two reverse
primers were designed to produce a common 27-bp sequence encoding a
9-amino acid hemagglutinin tag, followed by the specific chick lh21
cdna sequences. thus all resulting constructs could be expressed as
recombinant proteins with the hemagglutinin tag at their carboxyl
termini. four constructs were made: wtchlh21-hatag,m1chlh21hatag, m2chlh21-hatag, and m3chlh21-hatag. primers used for
making these chick lh21 constructs were as follows:
chf1 primer was 5⬘-ctcgagaccatgatgaaggggatgggctg3⬘; chf2, 5⬘-atgaatcgattctaccagctg-3⬘; chr1, 5⬘-tcaggcgtaatctggcacatcgtaagttaaagcaggaaaatcctc-3⬘; chr2,
5⬘-tcaggcgtaatctggcacatcgtatgctcctcttgatccaca-3⬘
(underlined regions in the two reverse primers indicate the sequences
encoding the hemagglutinin tag). chf1 and chr1 were used to amplify
the complete coding region sequence of chick lh21; chf1 and chr2 for
the m1 deletion; chf2 and chr1 for the m2 deletion; and chf2 and
chr2 for the m3 deletion (see fig. 7a).
two constructs (hatag-mihabp4 and mihabp4-hatag) were also
generated in a similar way for expression of recombinant protein for the
mouse homolog of chick lh21, with a hemagglutinin tag at either the
amino terminus or carboxyl terminus. primers used were as follows:
mf1, 5⬘-accatgtacccatacgacgtcccagactacgctaagggggccctggggagccct-3⬘; mf2, 5⬘-gtcatgaagggggccctggggagccctgtagc-3⬘; mr1, 5⬘-tcaggcgtaatctggcacatcgtatgggtaggccagggcggggaagtcctc-3⬘; mr2, 5⬘-tgacctcatgggaactccacaga-3⬘ (underlined sequences encode the hemagglutinin
tag).
cos-1 cells or cho-k1 cells were cultured in dulbecco’s modified
eagle’s medium or f-12 medium (life technologies, inc.), respectively,
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (hyclone). the day before
transfection, cells were subcultured in a 6-well plate to 60 – 80% confluency. these subconfluent cells were transfected with highly purified
plasmid dna (qiagen, chatsworth, ca) and superfect transfection
reagent (qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. at
24 – 48 h post-transfection, cells were lysed with m-per mammalian
extraction reagent (pierce, rockford, il) then subjected to sds-page
and western blot analysis using high affinity rat monoclonal antibody
(clone 3f10) against hemagglutinin tag (roche molecular biochemicals), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody
(goat anti-rat igg; pierce) and development with supersignal chemiluminescence reagent (pierce).
for stable transfection, transiently transfected cells prepared as
above were transferred into fresh growth media containing 800 ␮g/ml
neomycin  xxxg418xxx  (life technologies, inc.) selection drug at 24-h posttransfection and were continuously grown under drug selection for
about 2 weeks. individual cell clones were picked with cloning rings and
expanded with the same growth media containing 500 ␮g/ml  xxxg418xxx . the
expression level of tagged recombinant protein in these selected stable
transfectants was analyzed by sds-page and western blotting as
above.
glycosaminoglycan-binding assays—we used two assays to assess
hyaluronan binding activity. the first was a [3h]hyaluronan overlay
assay as described previously (9, 14). briefly, after separation by sdspage, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. the
blot was incubated in a solution of 1.2 ⫻ 107 cpm [3h]hyaluronan/ml of
pbs, in the presence or absence of 500 ␮g/ml hyaluronan hexasaccharide, for 16 h at room temperature, then washed thoroughly with cold
pbs and dried at room temperature. the blot was then sliced into 2-mm
segments, suspended in acetone, and counted.
in the second assay, binding of gags by epitope-tagged mouse recombinant protein in cell lysates was analyzed as described previously
(20). in brief, cho-k1 or cos-1 stable transfectants were cultured
continuously under  xxxg418xxx  selection pressure in 100-mm dishes. when
confluent, the cells were washed with cold pbs and lysed with m-per
lysis buffer, 1 ml/dish (pierce). insoluble materials in the lysates were
removed by centrifugation at 12,000 ⫻ g at 4 °c for 10 min. aliquots of
200 ␮l were incubated with 100 ␮g of gag (hyaluronan from rooster
comb, american seikagaku;  xxxd1687xxx  c from porcine rib
cartilage, sigma; or heparan sulfate from bovine intestine, sigma),
hyaluronan hexamer (14), or rna (yeast; roche molecular biochemicals) in 100 ␮l of h2o. as a negative control, water was added instead
of gag or rna solution. after 1-h incubation at room temperature,
cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc) was added to a final concentration of 1%
(w/v), and the solution was mixed and incubated for another hour at
room temperature with slow shaking. precipitated complexes containing gag or rna and bound proteins were collected by centrifugation at
12,000 ⫻ g for 10 min. pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of

during independent screenings, is defined as lh21 for further
characterization.
3⬘- and 5⬘-race reactions and cloning of mammalian homologs—
for cloning the full-length cdna of chick lh21, a library of adaptorligated double strand cdna was made with poly(a)⫹ rna from day 6
chick limbs using the marathon cdna amplification kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (clontech, palo alto, ca). the library
was used as a template for performing both 5⬘- and 3⬘-race reactions
based on the partial cdna sequence of the initial clone lh21. the
primer, f1, used for 3⬘-race was 5⬘-ttctaccagctgctggacgacgagt-3⬘, corresponding to bases 243–267 of the cdna sequence; and
the primer, r1, used for 5⬘-race was 5⬘-gccgtgcaaccactttgctgaggt-3⬘, complementary to bases 345–322 of the sequence. unique
bands obtained from 3⬘- and 5⬘-race were purified and ligated into the
pcrii vector (invitrogen) for sequence analysis. the full-length cdna
was then obtained by fusing the 3⬘- and 5⬘-race products by pcr
using the marathon kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
followed by sequencing. the sequence was verified by direct amplification of the whole cdna sequence by reverse transcription-pcr using a
primer pair at the extreme 5⬘- and 3⬘-ends of the extended cdna
sequence with the double strand cdna library as template.
for cloning the mammalian homologs of lh21, mouse and human
est as well as genbank娂 data bases were searched using the chick
sequence with blast (basic local alignment sequence tool) search
programs. a partial human cdna sequence encoding a protein called
 xxxg1012xxx  antigen (genbank娂 accession number u77327) and a mouse
est sequence (accession number w29443) were found to be the most
likely candidates for the mammalian homologs of chick lh21. based on
these two partial mammalian cdna sequences, a similar strategy to
that used for cloning full-length chick cdna was used to clone fulllength cdnas of the mammalian homologs of lh21, with some modifications. briefly, mouse and human heart poly(a)⫹ rnas were purchased from clontech laboratories, inc. the cdna templates for
race reactions were made using the smart race cdna amplification kit (clontech). for 5⬘-race reactions, a gc-rich pcr system
was used (clontech).
sequencing and sequence analysis—after race products were
cloned into the pcrii vector, the nucleotide sequences of these products
were determined by the double stranded dna/dideoxy chain termination method using a sequenase 2.0 kit (u.s. biomedical corp.).
blast programs on the web site established by the national center
of biological information were used for similarity searches in the genbank娂 and est data bases. the signalp program (17) was used to
predict signal peptide sequences; the psort program was used to find
possible signals for subcellular localization. for prediction of possible
motifs, simple modules, and domains in the protein sequences, smart
(simple modular architecture research tool) (18, 19) and motif programs were used. for multiple sequence alignment, the prettybox
program of the  xxxg873xxx  software package (version 10) was used.
northern blot analysis—for chick rna preparation, whole chick
embryos as well as chick embryonic tissues (limbs and brain) were used.
total rna and poly(a)⫹ rna were prepared as described previously
(15). samples of the poly(a)⫹ rna preparations were subjected to
electrophoresis in a formaldehyde gel and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. the membrane was probed with chick clone lh21
cdna labeled with [32p]dctp using a random priming dna labeling
kit (roche molecular biochemicals). hybridization and washes were
done under standard high stringency conditions.
for northern blot analysis of mouse mrnas, a nitrocellulose membrane preblotted with multiple poly(a)⫹ rnas prepared from different
mouse tissues was purchased from clontech. probe preparation,
hybridization, and controls were conducted according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
determination of gene organizaton by pcr—the genomic region
encompassing the chick lh21 cdna sequence was obtained by amplifying several overlapping genomic fragments, because the size of this
genomic region is too large for direct amplification (⬎20 kb). cloning of
pcr products and identification of boundary sequences between introns and exons were determined by the same strategy as previously
used (15).
construction and expression of epitope-tagged recombinant proteins—the complete coding region sequences of chick lh21 and three
truncated mutant cdnas (m1, m2, and m3; see fig. 7a) were amplified
by pcr reactions using different combinations of reverse and forward
primer pairs (see below) with the cloned full-length chick lh21 cdna
as template. the resulting pcr products were first cloned into the pcr
cloning vector pcrii to confirm their sequence authenticity through
sequence analysis from both directions of the insert. after sequence

solution containing 1% cpc and 30 mm nacl for each wash, and finally
suspended in 50 ␮l of 2⫻ sample buffer (2% sds, 200 mm dithiothreitol,
120 mm tris-hcl, ph 6.8). samples were then subjected to sds-page
and western blot analysis with rat monoclonal antibody (3f10 clone,
roche molecular biochemicals) against hemagglutinin tag as described
above. untreated lysate was loaded as a positive control. the relative
densities of the bands obtained in the western blots were determined
using a bioimage whole-band analysis package (millipore).
immunofluorescent staining—nih3t3 cells, cultured in 4-well
chamber slides (falcon) in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium plus
10% fetal bovine serum (hyclone), were transfected with pure plasmid
dna for either amino- or carboxyl-hemagglutinin-tagged cdna constructs. at 48 h post-transfection, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature then permeabilized with 0.3%
triton x-100 in pbs for 10 min. the expressed protein was detected by
rat monoclonal antibody (3f10 clone, roche molecular biochemicals)
against hemagglutinin tag followed by secondary antibody conjugated
with rhodamine (pierce). controls for protein staining were non-permeabilized cells, preincubation of primary antibody with tag peptide, or
incubation with rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody alone.

cloning of chick lh21 cdna—in previous studies (9, 15),
we reported the molecular characterization of a chick  xxxg1061xxx ,
cdc37. the cdna for cdc37 was isolated from a chick embryo
heart cdna library by immunoscreening with mab ivd4. this
antibody was selected by screening hybridomas raised against
a partially purified preparation of chick embryo habps in the
presence and absence of polymeric and oligomeric hyaluronan.
it recognizes a novel group of habps present in a variety of
tissue and cell types, especially in the embryo (14). here we
report characterization of a cdna, lh21, for a second  xxxg1061xxx 
recognized by mab ivd4, which we have termed  xxxg1012xxx .
we chose to investigate the cdna clone lh21, because, like
the original clone for cdc37, it displayed consistently strong
immunoreactivity with mab ivd4 during successive rounds of
immunoscreening of the chick heart cdna expression library.
the lh21 clone was isolated and sequenced by the same strategy as described previously for cdc37 (9). the size of the cdna
insert was about 1.2 kb, but initial examination of the sequence
suggested that the insert might be a partial cdna sequence.
northern blot analysis was performed using labeled lh21
cdna to hybridize with mrna preparations from chick embryonic brain and limb, and from the whole embryo. the result
(fig. 1b) showed a prominent band slightly larger in size than
18 s ribosomal rna, and a weak band similar in size to 27 s
ribosomal rna. because mrna was used rather than total
rna, the signals were not due to ribosomal rnas. furthermore, in a separate northern blot analysis, total rnas prepared from chick whole embryo, brain, and limb were loaded in
the same gel together with the mrna preparations. strong
signals were detectable only from the mrna samples, not from
the total rna samples (data not shown), indicating that the
transcription level of lh21 in the embryo is relatively low, and
confirming that the signals from the mrna preparations in
fig. 1b were specific. by comparing the size of the lh21
transcript (⬃2.0 kb as estimated from fig. 1b) with that of the
lh21 cdna we had cloned (⬃1.2 kb), it was clear that clone
lh21 was incomplete.
to extend the sequence of cdna lh21, we designed primers
f1 and r1 (fig. 1a) for 3⬘- and 5⬘-race reactions, respectively,
according to the known partial sequence of the clone. at least
10 independent clones for each pcr product from 3⬘- and
5⬘-race reactions were sequenced. by fusing the 3⬘- and 5⬘race products through a pcr reaction, we now obtained an
extended lh21 cdna of ⬃1.8 kb. to eliminate any possible
artifact during pcr and cloning, the cloned cdna sequence
was further confirmed by direct amplification of the whole
cdna by reverse transcription-pcr, using a chick embryo limb
cdna library as template. the size and sequence of this di-

rectly amplified pcr product were the same as that of the
fused cdna. the size of the extended lh21 cdna (⬃1.8 kb)
plus a poly(a) tail is consistent with that of the major band
from northern blot analysis (⬃2.0 kb, in fig. 1b). the putative
translational start codon conforms to the kozak consensus
sequence around a translation initiation site; furthermore, the
presence of an in-frame stop codon, upstream of the start codon
in the 5⬘-untranslated region, supports the prediction of an
open reading frame. at the end of the 3⬘-utr is a typical
polyadenylation signal, aataaa. thus, we believe that this
cdna represents the full-length lh21 cdna for chick
 xxxg1012xxx . the genbank娂 accession number for the chick sequence is af227683.
the extended cdna sequence described above contains an
open reading frame of 1071 bases, encoding a putative 357amino acid polypeptide with an expected molecular mass of
⬃42 kda (fig. 1a). lysates of cos-1 cells transfected with
epitope-tagged lh21 were analyzed by western blotting with
antibody against the hemagglutinin tag. the molecular mass of
the chick lh21-encoded protein,  xxxg1012xxx , was found to be ⬃45

examination of the deduced amino acid sequence of  xxxg1012xxx 
(fig. 1a) revealed multiple hyaluronan binding motifs: -(r/
k)x7(r/k)- (16). these motifs are between amino acid residues
lys-51 to arg-59, arg-151 to lys-173 (which contains three
overlapped -(r/k)x7(r/k)- motifs), and lys-267 to lys-275.
characterization of chick  xxxg1012xxx  gene—to analyze the
organization of the  xxxg1012xxx  gene, we used a long pcr strategy
by which we determined cdc37 gene organization (15). because the chick genomic region covering the lh21 cdna could
not be directly amplified by a single long pcr, numerous primers in both forward and reverse directions were designed along
the cdna sequence. several genomic dna fragments (⬍10 kb)
were amplified by long pcr using different sets of these primers, and cloned into the pcr2.1 vector for sequencing. the
boundaries at both ends of a given exon were determined by
comparing partially sequenced genomic sequences and cdna
sequences, and by pcr with primers that were either complementary to the cdna sequence immediately upstream from the
5⬘-end of an exon or identical to the cdna sequence immedi-

ately downstream from 3⬘-end of an exon. the organization of
the  xxxg1012xxx  gene is shown in fig. 2. the size of the genomic
region covering the lh21 cdna is about 20 kb. there are at
least seven exons and six introns in the  xxxg1012xxx  gene, and all
boundaries between introns and exons comply with the gt
(5⬘-end of the intron) and ag (3⬘-end of the intron) rules for
splicing sites (fig. 2b). the size of each intron was determined
by pcr as described previously and found to range from ⬃1.0
to ⬃6.0 kb.
cloning of mouse and human  xxxg1012xxx  homologs—to determine whether any possible homologs of chick  xxxg1012xxx  were
present in the data bases, a similarity search was performed
using blast programs. significant similarity to the deduced
lh21-encoded protein sequence was obtained for a partially
characterized human protein of unknown function, called ki1/57 (21).  xxxg1012xxx  is an intracellular protein recognized by the
 xxxg2302xxx  monoclonal antibody originally developed against an apparently unrelated cell surface protein,  xxxg2302xxx  (22). however,
the available cdna sequence encodes only a partial protein
sequence; the sequence encoding the amino-terminal part of
the protein is missing due to difficulties encountered in cloning
the full-length cdna (21). in addition, we found several newly
released mouse est sequences, which have very high similarity to human  xxxg1012xxx  cdna. based on the above sequence
information, we assumed that the cdna sequence of human
 xxxg1012xxx  and the mouse est sequences could represent portions
of cdnas for mammalian homologs of chick  xxxg1012xxx , and we
began attempts to clone the full-length cdna sequences for
both human and mouse  xxxg1012xxx .
we first assembled selected mouse est sequences to obtain
a maximum partial sequence, and then confirmed the assembled sequence by direct reverse transcription-pcr using mouse
heart mrna as template. based on this resulting mouse cdna
sequence, primers for 5⬘- and 3⬘-race reactions were designed
to extend the cdna using the same approach as that used in
chick lh21 cloning. as a result, the 3⬘ part of mouse cdna was
successfully obtained from 3⬘-race reactions, but the 5⬘race reactions did not give any distinct band even after numerous trials with different primers, high temperature rt
reactions, and hot-start taq dna polymerase enzymes. similarly, the authors who partially cloned human  xxxg1012xxx  cdna
could not obtain the 5⬘ part of the human cdna and suggested
that a rigid secondary structure at the 5⬘-end of the transcript
might prevent reverse transcription by conventional methods
(21). because the nature of the 5⬘ part of the mouse cdna
might be very similar to that of the human cdna and because
rigid gc-rich regions are often found at the 5⬘ region of
mrnas, we introduced a commercially available gc-rich pcr
system into our 5⬘-race reactions. this strategy enabled us to
obtain the 5⬘ part of mouse cdna (fig. 3a). as we predicted,
the cloned 5⬘ region (⬃400 bp from the 5⬘-end) of mouse cdna
shows very high gc content (⬎75%, see fig. 3a). interestingly,
multiple deletions reducing the gc content and overall size of
this region were found in the corresponding part of chick lh21
cdna (figs. 1a and 4), thus explaining the lack of problems
encountered during chick lh21 cdna cloning. the cloned
mouse cdna is about ⬃2.5 kb in size and contains a 1233-base
open reading frame region encoding 411 amino acids (fig. 3a).

novel intracellular hyaluronan-binding protein

to confirm that the deduced mouse  xxxg1012xxx  protein is encoded by the cloned cdna, we made two epitope-tagged mouse
 xxxg1012xxx  constructs. one of these is tagged with hemagglutinin
at the amino terminus and the other at the carboxyl terminus
so as to eliminate possible interference with expression, hyaluronan binding, or immunostaining by the 9-amino acid hemagglutinin tag at either end of the protein. transient expression of mouse  xxxg1012xxx  in cho-k1 cells showed that the
recombinant protein was equally expressed from either the
n-tagged or c-tagged construct, and the size of the protein in
each case was estimated to be ⬃55 kda (fig. 3b). thus the
mouse  xxxg1012xxx  protein is indeed encoded by the cloned cdna.
the molecular mass of mouse  xxxg1012xxx  is in good agreement
with the molecular mass of human  xxxg1012xxx  (57 kda) reported
previously (21).
we also completed the missing 5⬘ part of the partial cdna
sequence of human  xxxg1012xxx  by the same strategy used for
cloning mouse cdna. the deduced peptide sequence was extended from an original 299 amino acids to 413 (fig. 4). because extremely high similarity (⬃90% identity) was found
between mouse  xxxg1012xxx  protein and the completed human
 xxxg1012xxx  antigen (fig. 4), we regard the  xxxg1012xxx  as the human
 xxxg1012xxx  homolog. the genbank娂 accession number for the
human sequence is af241831.
in the deduced mouse  xxxg1012xxx  protein, as well as in the
extended human  xxxg1012xxx  protein, the hyaluronan-binding motifs, -(r/k)x7(r/k)-, were found to be well conserved in corresponding regions to those in chick (fig. 4). this supported the
possibility that  xxxg1012xxx  may be a novel hyaluronan-binding
protein. comparison of chick  xxxg1012xxx  with its mammalian
homologs (fig. 4) reveals ⬃48% identity and ⬃60% similarity
between chick and mouse or chick and human proteins. the
carboxyl-terminal region (⬃130 amino acids) is more conserved
among all three species (⬃80% identity) than the rest of the
protein and also contains a virtually identical -(r/k)x7(r/k)motif, kavvihksk(r), suggesting that this region might be a
critical region for the function of this protein.
we conducted further blast searches using the mouse and
human sequences. in addition to  xxxg1012xxx , another human pro-

transcript of ⬃5.5 kb were observed in mouse heart, brain, liver, and
kidney; no signal was detectable in mouse spleen, lung, or skeletal muscle.

noted with regions of some putative nucleic acid-binding proteins from invertebrates, e.g. the drosophila gene products vig
(accession number aaf44918) and cg11844 (accession number aaf56404). although these proteins have some relationship to rna-binding proteins, they do not contain rna recognition domains as assessed using the smart program. we also
used the smart program to search for rna recognition domains in  xxxg1012xxx  but found none. we used several programs to
search for other possible motifs and simple modules in  xxxg1012xxx 
to obtain clues as to its subcellular localization and its structural relationship to other proteins, but no such motifs were
revealed.
expression of  xxxg1012xxx  mrna in mouse tissues—to investigate mouse  xxxg1012xxx  expression pattern in mouse tissues, and
to examine whether the cloned mouse cdna is close in size to
its transcript, northern blot analysis was conducted. as shown
in fig. 5, mouse heart, brain, liver, and kidney tissues express
a prominent transcript of ⬃2.5 kb, consistent with the size of
cdna we have cloned. the origin of a faint band at ⬎5.0 kb is
unclear. however, spleen, lung, and skeletal muscle tissues do
not express  xxxg1012xxx  mrna, or express very low levels, indi-

of  xxxg1012xxx . a, bacterial lysate containing chick lh21 fusion protein was prepared as described previously (9). an aliquot of the lysate was electrophoresed,
transblotted, and overlaid with [3h]hyaluronan (solid bars), whereas another blot
prepared from an identical aliquot of the
lysate was incubated with [3h]hyaluronan in the presence of hyaluronan hexasaccharides (hatched bars). each blot was
cut into 2-mm segments for measurement
of radioactivity, which was then plotted
against the distance of migration during
electrophoresis. the inset shows a western blot (w) of a third blot after incubation with mab ivd4, and the total bacterial lysate (t) after electrophoresis and
staining with coomassie blue. note that
the peak of [3h]hyaluronan binding corresponds to the position of the ivd4-positive band in the western blot. b, cell lysate aliquots from cho-k1 cells stably
transfected with n-tagged mouse  xxxg1012xxx 
construct were incubated with different
gags, rna, or hyaluronan oligosaccharides and subjected to cpc precipitation.
coprecipitated proteins were subjected to
western blot analysis with antibody
against the hemagglutinin tag. the extreme right lane contains an aliquot of cell
lysate without addition of cpc or gag.

blots, and the relative amounts of  xxxg1012xxx

cating that  xxxg1012xxx  is unlikely to be a general housekeeping
gene. to our surprise, the major transcript of  xxxg1012xxx  in testis
is much more abundant and smaller (⬃1.35 kb) than that in
other tissues. two minor transcripts around 2.5 and 4.0 kb are
also expressed in the testis. the reasons for these differences
are not known, but alternative splicing, promoter usage, or
poly(a) usage are possibilities.
hyaluronan-binding properties of  xxxg1012xxx  —as discussed
above, the amino acid sequence of  xxxg1012xxx  includes several
conserved hyaluronan-binding motifs. however, because it is not
yet known whether these motifs are in fact hyaluronan-binding
sites within  xxxg1012xxx , we further examined whether  xxxg1012xxx 
protein actually binds hyaluronan, using two approaches.
for the first procedure, we expressed the recombinant chick
 xxxg1012xxx  as a fusion protein in bacteria (9). the bacterial proteins were then separated by sds-page, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and cut into strips. separate strips were
overlaid with [3h]hyaluronan or the antibody ivd4, which recognizes  xxxg1012xxx  (9, 14). a single band was obtained in the ivd4
western blot, and this band corresponded with the position of
[3h]hyaluronan binding (fig. 6a). addition of hyaluronan oli-

gosaccharides inhibited binding of [3h]hyaluronan, indicating
that this binding was specific. in addition, extracts of bacteria
lacking  xxxg1061xxx  were analyzed and found to exhibit no detectable binding of ivd4 or [3h]hyaluronan (data not shown).
in the second procedure, we produced stable transfectants
expressing n- and c-tagged  xxxg1012xxx . we then tested binding of
both n-tagged and c-tagged mouse  xxxg1012xxx  to various gags,
using a solution assay in which cell lysates containing tagged
 xxxg1012xxx  are mixed with gag, and then co-precipitation of
 xxxg1012xxx  with gag by cpc is measured (20). as can be seen in
fig. 6b, n-tagged mouse  xxxg1012xxx  was efficiently co-precipitated after preincubation with exogenous hyaluronan and addition of cpc. however, very small amounts of  xxxg1012xxx  were
co-precipitated with heparan sulfate or  xxxd1687xxx .
the amounts of co-precipitated  xxxg1012xxx  obtained in the presence of the various reagents was measured by densitometry
and expressed relative to the amount co-precipitated with hyaluronan. the percentages relative to hyaluronan were 0.9%
with heparan sulfate, 4.0% with  xxxd1687xxx , and zero
with hyaluronan oligomers, indicating that the interaction between mouse  xxxg1012xxx  and hyaluronan is specific and not sim-

ply due to charge interactions. we also performed the assay
using c-tagged mouse  xxxg1012xxx  and obtained the same result as
above (data not shown). these results demonstrate that
 xxxg1012xxx  is a specific  xxxg1011xxx .
because  xxxg1012xxx  may be related to putative nucleic acidbinding proteins, we also determined whether  xxxg1012xxx  binds
rna. to do this we used the second procedure above, because
rna binds to cpc in a similar fashion to gags. some binding
of  xxxg1012xxx  was obtained but to a much smaller degree (6.7%)
than with hyaluronan (fig. 6b).
intracellular localization of  xxxg1012xxx  —a 22-amino acid hydrophobic stretch that complies with the von heijne (23) ⫺3,
⫺1 rule for signal peptide cleavage is present at the amino
terminus of the deduced  xxxg1012xxx  protein. however, analysis by
the more rigorous signalp program (17) indicates that the
amino terminus is unlikely to contain a signal sequence. we
also suspected that a phosphatidylinositol glycan (gpi) anchorage sequence might lie at the carboxyl terminus of  xxxg1012xxx 
based on the ␻, ␻ ⫹ 2 rules of gerber et al. (24). because of the
uncertainty with respect to signal peptide and gpi anchorage
sequences, we made epitope-tagged wild type (wt) chick

as a diffuse, network-like pattern, especially in the perinuclear
region (fig. 8).  xxxg1012xxx  staining was completely eliminated in
the presence of the peptide tag or by omitting primary antibody; also, no  xxxg1012xxx  staining was observed in non-permeabilized cells (data not shown).
discussion

 xxxg1012xxx  as well as mutated forms with the putative signal
and/or gpi sequences deleted (fig. 7a). we then transiently
expressed the epitope-tagged proteins in cos-1 cells and analyzed their distribution in secreted and cell lysate fractions. we
expected that, if wt  xxxg1012xxx  is an intracellular protein, the
expressed proteins would be found exclusively in the cell-associated fraction whether or not deletions were made. if it is a
secreted protein, wt  xxxg1012xxx  would appear in the medium but
the m2 and m3 mutants would be cell-associated. if it is bound
to the plasma membrane via a gpi anchor, wt  xxxg1012xxx  would
be cell-associated but the m1 mutant would be in the medium.
the recombinant wt  xxxg1012xxx  protein and all three mutated
proteins were detected only in the cell lysate fractions, not in
the media (fig. 7b), suggesting that  xxxg1012xxx  is most likely an
intracellular protein.
to further investigate the subcellular localization of chick
 xxxg1012xxx  in cos-1 cells, stable transfectants of epitope-tagged
wt  xxxg1012xxx  and its mutant forms were generated. these transfectants were lysed and then fractionated by differential centrifugation. western blot analysis again showed that the majority of expressed protein (⬃70%) was in the cytosolic fraction;
about 30% was found in membrane and other organelle fractions. we conclude that chick  xxxg1012xxx  is an intracellular protein, mainly present in the cytoplasm. stable transfectants of
n- and c-tagged mouse constructs in cho-k1 cells were also
used for subcellular fractionation. subcellular fractionation
gave a similar distribution as found for chick  xxxg1012xxx , i.e. the
majority (⬃70%) of the  xxxg1012xxx  protein was found in the cytosolic fraction and ⬃30% in other membrane and organelle
fractions (data not shown).
we used immunocytochemistry to examine the distribution
of  xxxg1012xxx  in cells transiently transfected with hemagglutinintagged  xxxg1012xxx .  xxxg1012xxx  was visualized with antibody to hemagglutinin tag.  xxxg1012xxx  staining was seen in the cytoplasm

contrast image of the same field. note that only some of the cells
express  xxxg1012xxx  (two in this field), because the cells are transiently
transfected and not cloned. the remaining cells provide an internal
control for background staining.

in this study, we have characterized a novel and specific
 xxxg1061xxx . until the function of this protein is better understood,
we propose to call it  xxxg1012xxx , because three other ihabps
have been convincingly characterized, namely cdc37 (9),
 xxxg1061xxx / xxxg1061xxx  (10, 11), and p32 (12).  xxxg1012xxx  contains multiple hyaluronan-binding motifs throughout its sequence, notably one stretch with three overlapping motifs in the middle
region of the protein sequence. these motifs are conserved in
the chick, human, and mouse sequences, suggesting that
 xxxg1012xxx  may have a hyaluronan-related function. this conclusion is supported by our data showing that both chick and
mouse  xxxg1012xxx  bind hyaluronan in a specific fashion. however,
regions within  xxxg1012xxx  may be related to putative nucleic
acid-binding proteins, e.g. the drosophila vig gene product.
although  xxxg1012xxx  does not contain an established rna recognition domain, we tested  xxxg1012xxx  for rna-binding activity and
found it to exhibit weak binding compared with hyaluronan.
nevertheless, until further functional work is carried out, the
question of whether hyaluronan is the natural ligand for
 xxxg1012xxx  must remain open. the homologies found between
 xxxg1012xxx , the human protein cgi-55, and the above-mentioned
drosophila proteins suggest that  xxxg1012xxx  belongs to a family of
related genes.
unlike the other known ihabps referred to above,  xxxg1012xxx 
mrna is not ubiquitously expressed in adult tissues.  xxxg1012xxx 
mrna is found at significant levels in adult heart, brain, liver,
kidney, and testis, as well as in embryonic tissues, but not in
adult spleen, lung, or skeletal muscle. a very prominent transcript that is smaller than that found elsewhere was seen only
in testis. it is not yet known whether a different protein product from that found in this study results from this smaller
transcript. the human homolog, also known as  xxxg1012xxx , is
expressed in activated, but not resting, human lymphocytes
and is enriched in some tumor cells (21). obviously, to understand the function of this novel  xxxg1011xxx , further investigation
will be needed, including examination of the expression levels
of its mrna and protein in various normal cells versus corresponding tumor cells, as well as its interaction with other
regulatory or structural protein(s). in reference to the latter,
previous evidence suggests that  xxxg1012xxx  is associated with intracellular kinase activity (21).
a considerable amount of evidence has shown that sulfated
gag chains and proteoglycans are present in the cytoplasm
and nucleus of a variety of cell types and that in some cases
these intracellular gag populations are likely to be involved in
regulation of cell behavior. for example, it has been shown that
heparan sulfate can act as a trans-repressor that interferes
with the action of c-fos and c-jun on transcription events in
vitro, and preliminary evidence has suggested that endogenous
nuclear heparan sulfate has such a regulatory function in vivo
(25). in support of this possibility, specific inhibitory subpopulations of heparan sulfate are targeted to the nucleus during
cell proliferation (26, 27). also, dynamic changes occur in the
levels of biglycan and glypican proteoglycans in the nucleus
during the cell cycle, and the core proteins of these proteoglycans have been shown to contain nuclear localization motifs
(28). there is also definitive evidence that heparin is essential
for retention of several proteases present within secretory
granules of mast cells (29).
it has become increasingly evident that hyaluronan is also

29838

novel intracellular hyaluronan-binding protein
whereby intracellular hyaluronan might influence cellular
events. it is possible that the high level of hydration associated
with hyaluronan (2) also plays a role in structural changes in
the cytoskeleton or nuclear matrix during cell division or motility, e.g. in regulating cell shape or volume changes. interestingly, recent evidence suggests that hyaluronan-associated
changes in hydration play an important role in growth plate
expansion during bone development (44) but that most of the
hyaluronan at this site is intracellular (45). irrespective of the
role of intracellular hyaluronan, it is to be expected that its
functions will be regulated and/or mediated by ihabps. however, direct evidence for intracellular interaction in situ and for
the functional consequence of these interactions is needed to
elucidate this possibility.

present in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and other organelles in
various types of tissues and cells (5– 8). recent studies provide
evidence that exogenous hyaluronan added to transformed
10t1/2 cells accumulates in multiple subcellular compartments
and directly affects cell motility (13). moreover, it has been
shown that there is a dramatic increase in endogenous intracellular hyaluronan and redistribution from nucleolus to cytoplasm (mainly the perinuclear area) and interchromosomal
regions during mitosis of mitogen-stimulated smooth muscle
cells and fibroblasts (8). there is also an increase in pericellular hyaluronan during cell division (30, 31); however, extracellular hyaluronan that becomes internalized after addition to
dividing cells is distributed in a different pattern to that of
endogenous intracellular hyaluronan (8). similar changes in
the amounts and distribution of intracellular hyaluronan-binding sites also occur in dividing cells (8). thus, it is of interest
that  xxxg1012xxx  is localized in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and nucleolus of hodgkin’s and myeloma cell lines (32), indicating that
hyaluronan and  xxxg1012xxx , i.e.  xxxg1012xxx , may have overlapping
distributions. future studies will establish whether hyaluronan and  xxxg1012xxx  interact during cell division.
the data discussed above suggest a possible role for intracellular hyaluronan and ihabps in cell division. however, it is
not clear the extent to which hyaluronan is directly targeted to
various intracellular sites after synthesis rather than being
first secreted and then re-internalized. synthesis and interactions of pericellular hyaluronan have been shown to promote
cell detachment and rounding during mitosis (30, 31), anchorage-independent growth in culture (33, 34), and tumor growth
and progression in vivo (33–37). yet hyaluronan internalization has also been implicated in some of these processes (36, 38,
39). possibly, a dynamic balance between pericellular hyaluronan and intracellular hyaluronan exists, and hyaluronan reinternalization might contribute to this balance. this dynamic
balance could in turn be involved in regulating various cellular
behaviors. in this regard it is noteworthy that internalization
into endothelial cells of a complex of heparan sulfate-proteoglycan and a heparin-binding protein targets the latter to mitochondria, consequently preventing apoptosis (40). also, as
mentioned above, exogenously added hyaluronan can be targeted to various intracellular compartments and results in
increased cell motility (13). interestingly, targeting of hyaluronan to the nucleus was blocked by (r/k)x7(r/k)-containing
peptide in the latter study, suggesting the possible involvement
of an  xxxg1061xxx . although re-internalization of hyaluronan, and
other gags, is likely to contribute to intracellular pools, the
question of how these polymers reach sites such as the cytosol,
mitochondria, or nucleus remains unclear. one possibility is
that they are transported in a retrograde manner through the
golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, and cytosol in a similar manner
to some protein toxins or by other less understood, “non-classical” routes (41, 42).
although re-internalization subsequent to secretion is one
likely pathway whereby gags become localized to intracellular
sites, recent evidence (8) indicates that it is unlikely to be the
sole pathway for distribution of intracellular hyaluronan. another possible mechanism for intracellular targeting of hyaluronan arises from its unique mechanism of synthesis. hyaluronan is synthesized at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma
membrane, and secretion takes place by extrusion during polymer elongation (43). it is thus conceivable that a subpopulation
of hyaluronan polymer is directly deposited in the cytosol
rather than crossing the plasma membrane; this in turn may
be regulated by interaction with ihabps.
the most important, and puzzling, question arising from the
various studies discussed above is the exact mechanism
