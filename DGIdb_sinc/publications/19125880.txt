verapamil for cluster headache. clinical pharmacology
and possible mode of action
peer tfelt-hansen, md, dmsc; jacob tfelt-hansen, md, dmsc

verapamil is used mainly in cardiovascular diseases. high-dose verapamil (360-720 mg) is, however, currently the mainstay
in the prophylactic treatment of cluster headache. the oral pharmacokinetics are variable. the pharmacodynamic effect
of verapamil, the effect on blood pressure, also varies considerably among subjects. the dose of verapamil used for cluster
headache is approximately double the dose used in cardiovascular disease, most likely because verapamil is a substrate for the
efflux transporter p-glycoprotein in the blood–brain barrier. the access of verapamil to the central nervous system is therefore
limited. the clinical use of verapamil in cluster headache is reviewed and several relevant drug interactions are mentioned.
finally, its possible mode of action in cluster headache is discussed. the effect of verapamil in cluster headache most likely takes
place in the hypothalamus.verapamil is an l-type calcium channel blocker but it is also a blocker of other calcium channels
(t-, p-, and possibly n- and q-type ca2+ channels) and the human ether-a-go-go-related gene  xxxg1232xxx . with so many
different actions of verapamil, it is impossible at the present time to single out a certain mode of action of the drug in cluster
headache.

pamil in a dose of 360 mg daily is the only drug that
has been shown in a double-blind randomized clinical
trial to be superior to placebo in the preventive treatment of cluster headache.4
the dose of verapamil needed in the preventive
treatment of cluster headache patients varies considerably. thus, doses from 240 mg to 960 mg are recommended depending on effect and adverse events.3
in a few patients, even higher doses (1200 mg) are
needed.2 this could be due to either pharmacokinetic
or pharmacodynamic variability, or both, as suggested
for acute migraine treatment.5
in the following commentary, we will shortly
review the clinical pharmacology of verapamil. then,
the differences in doses of verapamil used in cardiology and neurology will be described. the clinical use

conflict of interest: none

it was recently stated that current therapeutic
actions of the existing available ca2+ channel blockers
are essentially confined to disorders of the cardiovascular system.1 cluster headache is, however, an
exemption. thus, high-dose verapamil is an increasingly common preventive treatment in cluster headache, and verapamil is currently the mainstay in the
preventive treatment of cluster headache.2,3 verafrom danish headache centre, department of neurology,

of verapamil in cluster headache will be commented
on; and finally, the possible mode of action will be
discussed.

pharmacokinetics of verapamil
verapamil is available as a racemate that
contains equal amounts of (r)-verapamil and
(s)-verapamil.6 verapamil is lipophilic and easily
absorbed from the gut.7 the drug is, however, the
subject of extensive first-pass metabolism in the
gut wall and the liver and the total oral bioavailability is only 10% to 30%.8 after multiple dosing
of controlled-release verapamil, the oral bioavailabilty was 27% for (s)-verapamil and 55% for
(r)-verapamil.9
verapamil has a volume of distribution of 300 l
for (r)-verapamil and 500 l for (s)-verapamil.9 it is
cleared by the liver by the cytochrome cyp3a4
enzyme with a half-life of 6-7 for both enantiomers.10
the metabolism of verapamil is stereospecific with
higher plasma concentrations of (r)-verapamil
than (s)-verapamil6 with a ratio of 5 : 1 after oral
administration.11verapamil is metabolized to active
metabolites, for example norverapamil, which has
20% of the potency of verapamil to block atrioventricular conduction.12
these data are, however, mean values and as
with other extensively metabolized drugs, pharmacokinetics vary considerably between subjects.13
after 240 mg as a controlled-release tablet, the
cmax varied 9-fold (30-278 ng/ml).13 after multiple
doses of 240 mg verapamil, the area under the curve
(auc) from intake to 24 hours varied considerably.
the mean auc (hour ¥ ng/ml) (⫾sd) was thus
3635 (+1733) for (r)-verapamil and 853 (+386) for
(s)-verapamil.9 this high variability is probably the
main reason for the variable doses needed in cluster
headache.
as a lipophilic substance, verapamil easily crosses
the blood–brain barrier. verapamil is, however, a
substrate for the efflux transporter p-glycoprotein
( xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx ) in the blood–brain barrier.14 the p-pg restricts
net brain uptake of verapamil by immediately transporting it out of the brain. the effect of the  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  on
verapamil uptake in the brain showed only minor
variability.15 thus, the mean ratio of aucbrain/

january 2009
aucblood of 11c-radioactivity was 0.42 (range 0.30 to
0.55) when 11c-verapamil was used in a pet investigation.15 similarly, the function of the  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  as measured by the cerebral volume of distribution (vd) of
(r)-[11c]verapamil was apparently relative invariant
(0.6 to 0.85).14 these investigations14,15 were extensive
in small numbers of subjects and do not exclude
some variability because of genetic disposition in the
general population.
the capacity of the p-pg efflux system is demonstrated by the results with [11c]verapamil in mdr1a/b
double-knockout mice with complete absence of
the p-pg protein.16 in these mice, 7% of the dose
of [11c]verapamil was found in the brain after
60 minutes whereas in the wild-type mice, it was only
0.4% showing the key role of the p-pg transport
system in verapamil brain clearance.17 there are no
data on the ability of norverapamil to cross the
blood–brain barrier.
high dose of verapamil has been reported to
result in nonlinear pharmacokinetics because of
partial saturation of presystemic metabolism of the
drug.17-19 in contrast, the  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  efflux function in brain
is most likely not saturable with even the higher doses
used in cluster headache. there are no primary
central nervous system (cns) symptoms indicating
an action on cns with verapamil overdose (up to
4 g). the toxic effects are cardiovascular with severe
bradycardia and hypotension.20
all ca2+ blockers are metabolized to less active
metabolites in the liver by oxidative pathways, predominantly by cytochrome p-450  xxxg590xxx , a subgroup
of the cytochrome p-450 enzyme family, and lesser
extent by other members of this enzyme family. and
it was recently shown that the pharmacokinetics
and pharmacodynamics of verapamil in healthy volunteers depend on the cytochrome p450, and the
 xxxg592xxx  genotype had a higher oral clearance of the
drug.21 however, there was no association between
the genotypes of  xxxg592xxx  and the antihypertensive
effect of verapamil.22
an important feature of the ca2+ blockers is
that age decreases the clearance of the drugs.23 this
should be considered by the clinician as av block
and sick sinus-node syndrome likewise increases
with age.

pharmacodynamics of verapamil
verapamil is an l-type calcium channel antagonist with anti-arrhythmic (pr-interval prolongation),24 angina, and antihypertensive effects. its mode
of action in cardiovascular diseases is somewhat well
elucidated.7 in contrast, its mode of action in cluster
headache is unknown.3
the enantiomers, (r)- and (s)-verapamil,
have different pharmacodynamic properties. thus,
(s)-verapamil was 20-fold more potent than (r)verapamil for prolongation of the pr interval
in healthy volunteers.6 in contrast, (r)-verapamil
caused a decrease in mean blood pressure.6
it is not fully elucidated why there is a tissueselectivity to ca2+ channels blockers, but there are
experimental data that may explain this phenomenon. verapamil and the other calcium antagonists
are all known to block calcium channels other than
the l-type calcium channel.25-27 the potency of differential effect on other ca2+ channels may in part
explain the tissue selectivity of the drugs. dihydropyridine ca2+ channel blockers also differ in their selectivity toward l- and p/q-type ca2+ channels. thus,
amlodipine and cilnidipine inhibit both l- and p/qtype ca2+ channels, whereas nifedipine and  xxxd2737xxx  are selective toward l-type calcium channels.28
furthermore, in vitro, several calcium antagonists (eg,
nifedipine) bind with some selectivity to the l-type
calcium channel in blood vessels, whereas verapamil
binds equally well to cardiac and vascular l-type
calcium channels.29 in vitro, all ca2+ channel blockers
depress sinus-node activity and slow atrioventricular
conduction;1 yet, only verapamil and diltiazem delay
atrioventricular conduction or cause sinus-node
depression at doses used clinically. this may explain
their use in supraventricular arrhythmia.
not only is there a large variability in the effect of
the different drugs on the same person, but likewise,
the response with the same drug in a cohort is widely
variable. thus, a study found that in individuals with
hypertension systolic blood pressure response to
verapamil ranged from a 33 mmhg decline to a
4 mmhg increase, with an average 12 mmhg
decrease.30 therefore, a genetic component to this
variability likely exists. in accordance with
this hypothesis, it was observed that the large-

119
conductance and voltage-dependent potassium (bk)
channel beta 1 subunit gene,  xxxg1260xxx , influences the
responsiveness to  xxxd3504xxx  and risk of adverse
cardiovascular outcomes.31

comparison of doses of verapamil
used in cardiovascular diseases
and cluster headache
in the very large (n = 22,576) invest study
on hypertension in patients with coronary artery
disease, the starting dose of verapamil was 240 mg
as a slow release formulation and the maximum dose
was 180 mg twice daily.32 in cardiology, the usually
used dose is 240 mg and the maximum dose of verapamil is 480 mg per day, whereas the maximum dose
of verapamil in the treatment of cluster headache is
720-960 mg.2 a few cluster headache patients need up
to 1200 mg daily.2,3 in one series of 108 cluster headache patients, age between 17 and 69 years, the mean
daily dose was 587 mg (range 240 to 1200 mg).2
the “mean neurological dose” is thus approximately twice “the mean cardiovascular dose.”
the difference in mean doses could be explained
by the fact that the cardiovascular effects are directly
related to blood levels of verapamil, whereas the
“neurological” effect (effect on cluster headache)
takes place across the blood–brain barrier where  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx 
restricts the access of verapamil to the brain.
clinical use of verapamil
in cluster headache
in patients without previous experience with
verapamil, it is not possible to predict the optimal
dose of verapamil. in this situation, the clinician
should start low and increase the dose every second
week until the optimal dose is reached. for use of
verapamil in cluster headache, see the table.
the treatment of cluster headache should be
evidence-based and the starting dose should be the
360 mg effective in a randomized clinical trial.4 the
dose can then be increased with 80 mg every second
week with electrocardiograph (ecg) control2 until
720 mg. the recommended clinical dose is 480 mg and
if this dose is exceeded, this fact needs to be explained
to the patient and informed consent obtained. a few
patients may need 960 or 1200 mg. because of the

possible partial saturation presystemic metabolism
of verapamil17-19 with possible nonlinear pharmacokinetics, weekly increments with 40 mg with ecg
control could be a cautious option. in patients with
previous experience with verapamil in previous
cluster periods, the start dose could be the previously
titrated dose.
in clinical practice, drug interactions with verapamil may be a problem, especially in chronic cluster
headache patients, who can be on verapamil for
many years. the possible interactions of verapamil, a
cyp3a4 inhibitor, are legion.42 in addition, the transport of verapamil by the  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  at the blood–brain
barrier may theoretically be the site of drug interactions .43-45 in addition, verapamil is a  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  inhibitor.45,46

among the many possible interactions, the following interactions are clinically relevant: verapamil
administration can inhibit the metabolism of midazolam,33 buspirone,34 simvastatin,35,36 atorvastatin,39
and carbamazepine.37,38 the doses of these drugs
should be adjusted or alternative drugs should be
used. for example, pravastatin, which is not the
subject of  xxxg590xxx  enzyme metabolism, can be used instead of simvastatin as an lipidlowering agent when the patients are treated with
verapamil.35 atorvastatin inhibits the metabolism
of verapamil resulting in higher blood levels of verapamil,47 and with the high doses of verapamil used in
cluster headache, this combination should be avoided.
a pharmacodynamic interaction between erythromycin and verapamil with prolongation of the pr
interval has been described in rats.48 one case of total
av block caused by concomitant use of verapamil
and erythromycin has been described.40 erythromycin has been associated with increased risk of sudden
death from cardiac causes especially in those who
concurrently used  xxxg590xxx  inhibitors.49 erythromycin
should therefore not be used together with verapamil.
a drug interaction between verapamil and
lithium with profound bradycardia, followed by
a fatal myocardial infarction in one case, has been
described.50 these 2 drugs are often used concomitantly in chronic cluster headache and these patients
should be controlled carefully with control of plasma
levels of lithium and with ecg. neurotoxicity of the
combination of lithium and verapamil with normal
plasma levels of lithium has, however, been described
in one case.51
rifampin is a potent inducer of the cytochrome
p450 oxidative enzymes and of the  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  transport
system.41 concomitant use results in decreased biovailability and plasma levels of verapamil.41
finally, grapefruit juice should be avoided during
verapamil treatment because it increases plasma level
of verapamil.52 in contrast, smoking decreases plasma
level.52

where and how does verapamil
work in cluster headache?
some of the most striking features of episodic
cluster headache are the circadian rhythmicity of the

headache
attacks: 50% of attacks occurring during the night.53
there is also a seasonal variation,54 and a relapsingremitting course. cluster headache is associated with
abnormal diurnal rhythms of hormones such as
cortisol, testosterone, growth hormone, and endorphins.55,56 the clinical course and the hormonal alterations have pointed to hypothalamus as the center
of origin in cluster headache.55,56 in addition, pet
studies have shown activation in the posterior hypothalamic gray matter in patients with attacks of
cluster headache.57 with voxel-based magnetic resonance imaging morphometry, increased neuronal
density was found in the same hypothalamic region.58
deep brain stimulation in this region has been used
with success in chronic intractable cluster headache
patients.59
the central biological clock of the mammalian
brain is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn)
and in rats a day–night difference in the l-type ca2+
current in scn that was sensitive to  xxxd2728xxx  was
observed.60 could verapamil exert an effect of scn in
humans? the drug has, however, been in use in medicine for decades and it is unlikely that an effect on the
biological clock would be unnoticed as an adverse
event during this extensive use. in addition, the concentration of  xxxd2728xxx  used in this60 and in another
study61 on scn was 2 mm and therefore suprapharmacological. this corresponds to 836 ng/ml
(mw = 418 g), whereas cmax after  xxxd2728xxx  60 mg
was 10 ng/ml62 and moreover the protein binding in
plasma is greater than 95%. the used dose in vitro of
nimodpine60,61 is thus more than 100 times greater
than the free drug concentrations in vivo. furthermore, the permeability of  xxxd2728xxx  into the brain
is restricted by  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx .63,64 so, whether  xxxd2728xxx 
can exert an effect on scn in man remains an open
question.
synaptic transmission is dependent upon the
entry of ca2+ through presynaptic voltage-activated
ca2+ channels.26 in central mammalian neurons, one
low (t-type) and at least 6 high voltage-activated ca2+
channels (l-, n-, o-, p-, q-, and r-type) have been
identified.26,65
in one study in the rat striatum, the authors found
that verapamil blocked p- and at higher concentrations possibly n- and q-type ca2+ channels, whereas

121
diltiazem appeared to block only p-type ca2+
channels.26 the human t-type calcium channel is also
blocked by verapamil.66
both  xxxd2728xxx  and diltiazem showed memoryenhancing effect in mice.67 in contrast, in this study68
and in several other studies, verapamil had no effect
on learning of different tasks.68 these results do of
course not explain the effect of verapamil but demonstrate merely in principle that among the l-type
ca2+ channel antagonists there are differences in their
effect on the cns in animals. the effect of verapamil
could be due to its additional effect on other ca2+
channels or to differences in binding to the l-type
ca2+ channels  xxxg346xxx .2 and  xxxg305xxx , which are the predominant brain l-type ca2+ channels,69 including
the anterior hypothalamus,70 paraventricular and
ventromedial nuclei.71 t-type,28 p/q-type,25,27 and
n-type72 calcium channels are also present in the
hypothalamus.
the 3 major classes of calcium blockers, dihydropyridines, diltiazem, and verapamil, have separate
binding sites, but overlapping or allosterically linked,
to the a1c subunit of the  xxxg346xxx .2 ca2+ channel.73 the
dihydropyridines binding site is near the opening
of the channel, the diltiazem site in the middle,
and the verapamil site is near the central pore of
the channel.74
finally, it should be noted that the effect of verapamil is not restricted to calcium channels. verapamil
inhibits various potassium channels.75 the voltagedependent k+ channels belonging to the ether-ago-go family are widely distributed in the mammalian
cns.76,77 verapamil is an antagonist at the human
ether-a-go-go-related gene (herg or  xxxg1246xxx )
 xxxg1232xxx  whereas nifedipine has no blocking effect78 and verapamil has been used in cardiovascular research as an herg  xxxg1232xxx 
blocker.75,79 it is possible that verapamil also acts on
herg potassium channels in the cns.
in conclusion, the possible modes of action of
verapamil in cluster headache are legion but most
likely due to an effect on either the low (t-type) or
the high voltage-activated ca2+ channels (l-, n-, p,
q-type). although generally described as an l-type
calcium blocker, verapamil has possible effects on a
range of other ca2+ channels present at the most

122
likely pathogenic center, the hypothalamus. at this
point, we are thus not able to point to a specific
action underlying the efficacy of verapamil in cluster
headache.
