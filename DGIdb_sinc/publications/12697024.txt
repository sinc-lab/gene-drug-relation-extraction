okadaic acid-induced, naringin-sensitive phosphorylation of  xxxg928xxx  in isolated rat hepatocytes.   xxxg928xxx  ( xxxg928xxx ) is an abundant cytosolic enzyme that catalyses the methylation of glycine into sarcosine, coupled with conversion of the methyl donor, s - xxxd3156xxx  ( xxxd3156xxx ), into s - xxxd3157xxx  ( xxxd3157xxx ).  xxxg928xxx  is believed to play a role in monitoring the  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratio, and hence the cellular methylation capacity, but regulation of the enzyme itself is not well understood. in the present study, treatment of isolated rat hepatocytes with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, was found to induce an overphosphorylation of  xxxg928xxx , as shown by proteomic analysis. the analysis comprised two-dimensional gel electrophoretic separation of (32)p-labelled phosphoproteins and identification of individual protein spots by matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. the identity of  xxxg928xxx  was verified by n-terminal edman sequencing of tryptic peptides. chromatographic separation of proteolytic peptides and (32)p-labelled amino acids suggested that  xxxg928xxx  was phosphorylated within a limited region, and only at serine residues.  xxxg928xxx  phosphorylation could be suppressed by naringin, an okadaic acid-antagonistic flavonoid. to assess the possible functional role of  xxxg928xxx  phosphorylation, the effect of okadaic acid on hepatocytic  xxxd3156xxx  and  xxxd3157xxx  levels was examined, using hplc separation for metabolite analysis. surprisingly, okadaic acid was found to have no effect on the basal levels of  xxxd3156xxx  or  xxxd3157xxx . an accelerated  xxxd3156xxx - xxxd3157xxx  flux, induced by the addition of methionine (1 mm), was likewise unaffected by okadaic acid. 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside, an activator of the hepatocytic amp-activated protein kinase, similarly induced  xxxg928xxx  phosphorylation without affecting  xxxd3156xxx  and  xxxd3157xxx  levels. activation of camp-dependent protein kinase by dibutyryl-camp, reported to cause  xxxg928xxx  phosphorylation under cell-free conditions, also had little effect on hepatocytic  xxxd3156xxx  and  xxxd3157xxx  levels. phosphorylation of  xxxg928xxx  would thus seem to play no role in regulation of the intracellular  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratio, but could be involved in other  xxxg928xxx  functions, such as the binding of folates or aromatic hydrocarbons.
