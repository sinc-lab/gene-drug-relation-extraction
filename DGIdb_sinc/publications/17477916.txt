abstract
modafinil is a mild psychostimulant used for the treatment of sleep and arousal-related disorders, and has been considered a pharmacotherapy
for cocaine and amphetamine dependence; however, modafinil's mechanism of action is largely unclear. the present study investigated modafinil
using drug discrimination and slice superfusion techniques. rats were trained to discriminate cocaine (1.6 or 5 mg/kg) or amphetamine (0.3 mg/
kg) from saline injection for food reinforcement. modafinil (64–128 mg/kg) substituted partially for both cocaine doses and amphetamine.
pretreatment with a lower modafinil dose (32 mg/kg) augmented the discriminative stimulus properties of cocaine (1.6 mg/kg dose group) and
amphetamine. in neurochemical experiments, modafinil (100–300 mum) evoked [3h]overflow from rat striatal slices preloaded with [3h]dopamine
in a concentration-dependent manner; however, modafinil was less potent and efficacious than amphetamine and nicotine. the dopamine
transporter inhibitor  xxxd2746xxx  (10 mum) blocked modafinil-evoked [3h]overflow, and concentrations of modafinil (b 100 mum) that did not have
intrinsic activity attenuated amphetamine (1 and 3 mum)-evoked [3h]overflow. modafinil-evoked [3h]overflow was not altered by the nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor antagonist  xxxd2550xxx , and modafinil did not alter nicotine-evoked [3h]overflow, indicating that nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors likely are not important for modafinil's mechanism of action. the present results indicate that modafinil evokes dopamine release from
striatal neurons and is a psychostimulant that is pharmacologically similar to, but much less potent and efficacious than, amphetamine.

1. introduction
modafinil (diphenyl-methyl sulphinil-2- xxxd63xxx ; provigil,
 xxxd2663xxx  and vigiler) is a wake-promoting psychostimulant that
is approved by the u.s. food and drug administration for the
treatment of narcolepsy, shift work sleep disorder and as an
adjunctive treatment for obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea
syndrome (ballon and feifel, 2006). modafinil also is effective
for attenuating the symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity
disorder, symptoms of dysphoric mood disorders, negative

symptoms of schizophrenia, and cognitive deficits found in
organic brain syndromes and alzheimer's disease (nasr, 2004;
ballon and feifel, 2006; krebs et al., 2006).
a concern with the use of traditional psychostimulants,
such as amphetamines, for psychiatric disorders is their
relatively-high abuse and dependence liability. however,
research in humans suggests that modafinil has less of an
abuse liability than amphetamines or cocaine (warot et al.,
1993; jasinski and kovacevic-ristanovic, 2000; myrick et al.,
2004). in a drug discrimination assay, modafinil induced a
state that was distinct from amphetamine and cocaine (warot
et al., 1993; rush et al., 2002). moreover, modafinil has
recently been considered as a treatment to minimize the
withdrawal symptoms from long-term amphetamine or cocaine
use (dackis et al., 2003, 2005).

m.m. dopheide et al. / european journal of pharmacology 568 (2007) 112–123

modafinil has a similar behavioral profile in rodents and
humans to increase arousal and improve cognitive processes.
for example, modafinil (30–300 mg/kg) increased wakefulness
and enhanced performance in serial-reversal and working
memory tasks in rats (edgar and seidel, 1997; beracochea et
al., 2001). regarding drug abuse and dependence, modafinil
was not self-administered, nor did it induce conditioned place
preference (deroche-gamonet et al., 2002), supporting the
human research suggesting that modafinil has low addiction
liability. in rats in which cocaine (10 mg/kg) was trained as a
discriminative stimulus, modafinil (250 mg/kg) partially
substituted (∼ 67% of responses on the cocaine-paired lever)
for the cocaine stimulus (gold and balster, 1996).
despite the behavioral efficacy of modafinil, its mechanism of
action has not been defined clearly. modafinil research has
focused on orexin receptors, adrenoceptors and serotonin
receptors (wisor and eriksson, 2005; ballon and feifel, 2006).
however, the role of each receptor is unclear, and it appears that
none of these candidates are solely responsible for modafinil's
effects. another possible mechanism is elevation of extracellular
dopamine levels, the mechanism of action traditionally attributed
to cocaine and amphetamine's efficacy (pierce and kumaresan,
2006). cocaine and amphetamine function as an inhibitor and
substrate of the  xxxg2149xxx , respectively (chen and
reith, 2002; sulzer et al., 2005). mignot and colleagues
determined that modafinil, at concentrations of 10 mum and
greater, bound to the  xxxg2149xxx  and inhibited [3h]
dopamine uptake in rat brain neurons (mignot et al., 1994).
madras and colleagues recently reported that modafinil inhibited
(ic50 value = 6 mum) [3h]dopamine uptake in human dopamine
transporter expressed in human embryonic kidney cells, and
occupied  xxxg2149xxx  in monkey striatum after injection
(5 mg/kg, i.v.) (madras et al., 2006). microdialysis studies
determined that modafinil (100 mg/kg) increased extracellular
dopamine levels in brain (ferraro et al., 1996), although modafinil
was less potent (∼ 50-fold) than amphetamine (nishino et al.,
1998). it is important to note that not all modafinil research
indicates a role for dopamine (akaoka et al., 1991; de sereville et
al., 1994; simon et al., 1995). for example, in a superfusion assay,
modafinil (10 mum) was ineffective to evoke [3h]overflow from
mouse striatal synaptosomes preloaded with [3h]dopamine
(simon et al., 1995). however, based on the research investigating modafinil and the  xxxg2149xxx  (mignot et al.,
1994; madras et al., 2006), higher modafinil concentrations (≥
∼ 10 mum) may have been necessary to observe [3h]overflow.
a mechanism that has not received attention is acetylcholine
activity, specifically that of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.
the  xxxg456xxx  agonist nicotine shares
some behavioral properties with modafinil in human and
animals (edgar and seidel, 1997; beracochea et al., 2001; le
foll and goldberg, 2006) and evokes dopamine release from
brain (mansvelder et al., 2002). as such, it is possible that
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors mediate the effect of modafinil
to change behavior and evoke neurotransmitter release.
the objective of the present study was to investigate the
mechanism of action for modafinil, using behavioral and in
vitro techniques. in drug discrimination experiments using rats,

113

a high or low cocaine dose or amphetamine was trained as the
discriminative stimulus. subsequently, modafinil substitution
for the stimulus and the effect of modafinil pretreatment on the
stimulus were determined. the drug discrimination experiments
were performed to understand better modafinil's interaction
with amphetamine and cocaine in a behavioral assay. to
understand modafinil's effects in a neurochemical assay, the
concentration-response profile for modafinil to evoke [3h]
overflow from rat striatal slices preloaded with [3h]dopamine
was determined. the profiles for amphetamine and nicotine also
were determined as comparison drugs. to investigate the
interaction of modafinil with the  xxxg2149xxx , the
effect of the  xxxg2149xxx  inhibitor  xxxd2746xxx  on
modafinil-evoked [3h]overflow, and the effect of modafinil on
amphetamine-evoked [3h]overflow were determined. to investigate the interaction of modafinil with nicotinic receptors,
the effects of the antagonist  xxxd2550xxx  on modafinilevoked [3h]overflow and modafinil on nicotine-evoked [3h]
overflow were determined.
2. materials and methods
2.1. animals
the university of missouri institutional animal care and
use committee approved the present procedures. male
sprague–dawley rats (harlan, indianapolis in) were housed
two subjects per cage and received ad libitum access to tap
water. for the [3h]overflow experiment, rats received ad
libitum access to standard rodent chow. for the drug
discrimination experiment, rats received restricted access to
chow (∼ 80% of daily consumption by rats that receive ad
libitum access), and as a consequence, rat body weights were
maintained at ∼ 400 g. the colony was maintained under a 12hour/12-hour light/dark cycle and all experiments were
conducted during the light phase.
2.2. drugs
throughout the manuscript, drug concentrations and doses
represent the free base weight.
d-amphetamine so 4, cocaine hcl, and  xxxd2746xxx 
 xxxd2536xxx  were purchased from sigma chemical co. (st. louis
mo). for the drug discrimination assay, modafinil (cephalon,
frazer pa) was purchased from hy-vee pharmacy (macomb
il). modafinil was purchased from sigma for the [3h]overflow
assay.  xxxd228xxx , glucose and  xxxd2850xxx  hcl were
purchased from acros organics (fairlawn nj). radiolabeled
dopamine (dihydroxyphenylethylamine 3,4-[ring-2,5,6-3 h])
was purchased from perkinelmer life sciences (boston ma).
all other chemicals were purchased from fisher scientific
(pittsburgh pa).
for the drug discrimination assay, amphetamine and cocaine
were dissolved in saline (0.9% w/v) vehicle. the drug injection
volume was 1 ml solution/kg body weight. cocaine was administered i.p. and amphetamine was administered s.c. modafinil
was dissolved in a water vehicle containing c2h6os (dmso,

114

0.1% v/v) and administered p.o. via gavage at a volume of 1 ml
solution/kg body weight.
2.3. drug discrimination assay
standard operant chambers (env-001; med associates,
georgia vt) were used. the sidewalls of the chamber were
aluminum, the front and back walls were clear plexiglas, and the
floor consisted of stainless steel rods. a recessed receptacle
(5 ×4.2 cm) was located at the bottom-center of one of the sidewalls
of the chamber and response levers were located on either side of
the receptacle. responses made on the active lever were reinforced,
and responses made on the other, inactive lever were recorded but
had no scheduled consequence (i.e., were not reinforced).
completion of the response requirement resulted in delivery of a
food pellet (20 mg; bio-serv, frenchtown nj) into the receptacle.
all stimulus and response events were recorded and controlled by a
computer running med associates' med pc-iv software.
rats were initially trained to respond on the levers in the
operant chamber. responding on either lever was maintained by
a fixed-ratio (fr) 1 schedule of pellet delivery. once
responding was established on fr 1, the ratio requirement for
delivery was gradually increased to fr 10. subsequently, rats
were assigned randomly to 1 of 3 groups in which the
discriminative stimulus was 0.3 mg/kg amphetamine (n = 6
rats), 1.6 mg/kg cocaine (n = 6 rats) or 5 mg/kg cocaine (n = 7
rats), and training commenced. the amphetamine dose was
selected because it is within the range of doses typically used in
rodent drug discrimination studies (stolerman et al., 1995). the
cocaine doses are less than the typical cocaine dose (10 mg/kg)
used in other experiments (stolerman et al., 1995; schechter,
1997). our previous research demonstrated that these doses can
serve as a discriminative stimulus. furthermore, specific
generalization to the stimulus was observed with drugs from
various pharmacological classes (cunningham et al., 2006).
in these training sessions, rats were administered drug or
saline, returned to the home cage for 10 min, and then placed in
the chamber where only one of the levers was active (i.e.,
delivered pellets). following administration of drug, one lever
was active, and following administration of saline, the other
lever was active. the lever designated as drug-paired was
counterbalanced within each stimulus group. each session was
terminated after 15 min or 300 total responses, whichever
occurred first. only one training session was conducted daily,
and the presentation of drug or saline across sessions adhered to
the following pattern of saline (s) and drug (d): s, d, d, s, s, d,
s, d, s, s, d, d.
within a session, performance was assessed on the first
completed ratio. a correct lever selection was recorded when
the rat made 10 responses on the injection-appropriate lever
with no more than 5 responses on the incorrect lever. the
criterion for acquisition (stimulus control) for each rat was
correct lever selection on 8 out of 10 successive daily sessions.
these criteria for stimulus control were selected from previous
studies conducted by the experimenter (nation et al., 2000).
after all rats reached stimulus control, substitution and drug
interaction tests began. in the substitution and interaction test

sessions, both levers were active and 10 responses on either
lever resulted in pellet delivery. at least five daily training
sessions followed each test session. the order of saline and drug
administration on these subsequent training sessions followed
the pattern described for initial training toward stimulus control.
substitution tests examined responding after administration
of different modafinil doses. rats were administered 32, 64 or
128 mg/kg modafinil or vehicle and returned to the home cage.
following a 10–240 min delay, rats were placed in the operant
chamber. after delivery of a pellet or 15 min, rats were removed
from the box. this procedure was followed at a 10, 30, 60, 120
and 240 min delay after the modafinil or vehicle injection. as
such, each modafinil dose was evaluated at each of the five time
points in a single daily session. the modafinil doses were
selected based on previous experiments using rodents (gold and
balster, 1996; edgar and seidel, 1997; beracochea et al., 2001);
however, the 128 mg/kg dose was the maximal dose because it
was the limit of solubility in vehicle.
in the interaction tests, the effect of pretreatment with
modafinil or vehicle on cocaine and amphetamine was
determined. rats were administered 32 mg/kg modafinil or
vehicle, and returned to the home cage for 50 min. rats in the
1.6 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg cocaine groups were administered
cocaine (0.016–1.6 mg/kg and 0.16–5 mg/kg, respectively),
and those in the amphetamine group were administered
amphetamine (0.01–0.3 mg/kg). after the cocaine or amphetamine injection, rats were returned to home cage for 10 min, and
then placed in the operant chamber. the effect of modafinil or
vehicle on a different cocaine or amphetamine dose was
determined on a subsequent session. the modafinil dose and the
duration between modafinil injection and placement in the
operant chamber were selected based on the results of the
substitution tests (figs. 1 and 2), as a dose and duration that did
not result in substitution for the discriminative stimulus.
for the substitution and interaction tests, response rates were
the first dependent measure and were calculated by dividing the
total number of responses on both levers by the total session
time. if no responses were performed on either lever, a rate of
zero was assigned. separate statistical analyses were performed
for each of the three discriminative stimulus groups. for the
substitution test, data were analyzed via 2-way repeatedmeasures analysis of variance (rm-anova; spss, version
10.0, chicago il) with modafinil dose and time as withinsubject factors. for the interaction test, response rate data were
analyzed via 1-way repeated-measures anova with cocaine
or amphetamine dose as a within-subject factor. tukey post
hoc tests were performed when appropriate (p b 0.05). the
second dependent measure was the percentage of responses on
the cocaine- or amphetamine-paired lever (the number of
responses on the drug-paired lever divided by the total number
of responses on the drug- and saline-paired levers). full
substitution was defined as greater than 80% of responses
performed on the amphetamine- or cocaine-paired lever and
partial substitution was defined as 40–80% of responses
performed on the drug-paired lever (appel et al., 1982). ed50
values were determined via linear regression (graph pad prism,
version 3.03, san diego ca). for the interaction tests, the

[ 3 h]overflow experiment 1 determined the effect of
modafinil, amphetamine and nicotine. five baseline samples
were collected. modafinil (0.1–300 mum), amphetamine (1–
10 mum) and nicotine (10–100 mum) were added and superfusion
continued for 6 min. the modafinil concentrations were
selected from the range where modafinil was active in vitro
(mignot et al., 1994; madras et al., 2006), and the amphetamine
and nicotine concentrations were selected based on our previous
[3h]overflow experiments and the literature (teng et al., 1997;
miller et al., 2005). one slice was superfused in the absence of
drug and represented a control condition. slices were then
superfused with only buffer for 20 min. upon completion of
superfusion, slices and filters were removed from the reaction
chamber. radioactivity in superfusate samples and slices/filters
was measured by liquid scintillation spectroscopy (ls 6500
scintillation counter, beckman-coulter, fullerton ca; counting efficiency ≈ 60%).
fractional release for each superfusate sample was calculated
by dividing the [3h] collected in each 2 min sample by the total
[3h] present in the tissue at the time of sample collection. basal

fig. 1. modafinil substitutes partially for the cocaine discriminative stimulus. a
low or high dose of cocaine (1.6 or 5 mg/kg, respectively) was trained as a
stimulus for delivery of a food pellet. on a substitution test, rats were
administered vehicle or 32, 64 or 128 mg/kg modafinil, and placed in the operant
chamber after a 10, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min delay. the top panels represent the
mean (±s.e.m.) percentage of responses on the cocaine-paired lever and the
bottom panels represent the mean (±s.e.m.) response rate data (n = 6–7 rats/
group).

slopes and intercepts (elevations) of the lines were calculated,
and significant differences in these values in the presence and
absence of modafinil were revealed via t-tests.
2.4. [3h]overflow assay
rats were euthanized via rapid decapitation and striata were
dissected and sliced (750 mum thick slices). slices were incubated
in oxygenated buffer (in mm, 108 nacl, 25 nahco3, 11.1
glucose, 4.7 kcl, 1.3 cacl2, 1.2  xxxd2534xxx , 1.0 na2hpo4, 0.11
 xxxd228xxx , 0.004 edta) in a metabolic shaker at 37 °c for
30 min. slices were transferred to fresh buffer, [3h]dopamine
(0.1 mum) was added, and slices were incubated for an additional
30 min. each slice was then transferred to 1 of 12 reaction
chambers (0.2 ml) bounded by glass microfiber filters (gf/b,
whatman, madistone england) in an automated superfusion
system (suprafusion 2500, brandel, gaithersburg md).  xxxd2850xxx  (10 mum) was included in buffer to inhibit monoamine
oxidase (westerink and kikkert, 1986). slices were superfused
at a rate of 0.75 ml/min. after 65 min, sample collection
commenced at a rate of 1 sample per 2 min.

fig. 2. modafinil partially substitutes for the amphetamine discriminative
stimulus in a time-dependent manner. amphetamine (0.3 mg/kg) was trained as
a discriminative stimulus for delivery of a food pellet. on a substitution test, rats
were administered vehicle or 32, 64 or 128 mg/kg modafinil, and placed in the
operant chamber after a 10, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min delay. the top panel
represents the mean (± s.e.m.) percentage of responses on the amphetaminepaired lever and the bottom panel represents the mean (±s.e.m.) response rate
data (n = 7 rats/group).

[3h]outflow was calculated from the average of fractional
release in the five samples just before the addition of the
compound. the fractional samples greater than baseline were
summed and basal outflow was subtracted to determine total
[3h]overflow.
for [3h]overflow experiment 1, separate series of analyses
were performed for modafinil, amphetamine and nicotine. each
set of total [3h]overflow data was analyzed via 1-way rmanova with modafinil concentration, amphetamine concentration or nicotine concentration as within-subject factors.
fractional [3h] release data (i.e., the time course) were analyzed
via 2-way rm-anova with time and modafinil concentration, amphetamine concentration or nicotine concentration as
within-subject factors. tukey post hoc comparisons were
performed when appropriate (p b 0.05).
[3h]overflow experiment 2 determined the concentrationresponse function for modafinil in the presence of an excess
concentration (10 mum) of the  xxxg2149xxx  inhibitor
 xxxd2746xxx . the 10 mum concentration is ∼ 67-fold greater than
the ic50 value (0.15 mum) for  xxxd2746xxx  to inhibit [3h]dopamine
uptake in rat brain (hunt et al., 1974). the procedure was similar to
that for [3h]overflow experiment 1; however, buffer contained
 xxxd2746xxx  for the entire period of superfusion. total [3h]
overflow data were analyzed via 1-way rm-anova with
modafinil concentration as a within-subject factor. fractional
[3h] release data were analyzed via 2-way rm-anova with
modafinil concentration and time as within-subject factors. a
supplemental analysis was performed to compare the concentration-response for modafinil in the presence and absence of
 xxxd2746xxx  (comparison of [3h]overflow experiments 1 and 2).
comparison of the control conditions (superfusion in the absence
of modafinil) revealed that there was greater (∼ 110%) basal [3h]
overflow in the presence than in the absence of  xxxd2746xxx 
(table 1). as such, total [3h]overflow data were calculated as a
percent of basal [3h]overflow. these data were analyzed via 2-way
rm-anova with modafinil concentration as a within-subject
factor and  xxxd2746xxx  concentration as a between-group factor.
[ 3 h]overflow experiment 3 determined the effect of
modafinil on amphetamine-evoked [3h]overflow. buffer did
not contain  xxxd2746xxx  for this and each subsequent
experiment. after the collection of five baseline samples,
modafinil (0.01–30 mum) was added and superfusion continued
for 10 min. amphetamine (1 or 3 mum) was added for 6 min.
slices were then superfused with buffer that did not contain
modafinil or amphetamine for 14 min. the modafinil
concentrations were selected as those that did not have intrinsic

activity (fig. 4) and the amphetamine concentrations were
determined from the results of our previous research (miller et
al., 2005). one control slice was superfused with only
amphetamine, and a second control slice was superfused with
only buffer. total [3h]overflow data were analyzed via 2-way
rm-anova with modafinil concentration as a within-subject
factor and amphetamine concentration as a between-group
factor. fractional [3h] release data were analyzed via 3-way
rm-anova with modafinil concentration and time as
within-subject factors and amphetamine concentration as a
between-group factor.
[3h]overflow experiment 4 determined if modafinil-evoked
3
[ h]overflow is altered by the  xxxg456xxx 
antagonist  xxxd2550xxx  (papke et al., 2001). after the
collection of 5 baseline samples,  xxxd2550xxx  (0.1–
10 mum), within the concentration used to inhibit the effect of
nicotine in the slice superfusion assay (teng et al., 1997), was
added to buffer. slices were superfused with  xxxd2550xxx  for
6 min, modafinil (100 mum) was added to buffer, and samples
were collected for an additional 6 min. slices were then
superfused for 14 min with buffer that did not contain
 xxxd2550xxx  or modafinil. one control slice was superfused
with only modafinil, and a second control slice was superfused
without  xxxd2550xxx  or modafinil.
[ 3 h]overflow experiment 5 determined the effect of
modafinil on nicotine-evoked [3h]overflow. after the collection
of five baseline samples, modafinil (0.01–30 mum) was added
and superfusion continued for 10 min. nicotine (10 mum) was
added for 6 min. slices were then superfused with buffer that
did not contain modafinil or nicotine for 14 min. the modafinil
concentrations were selected as those that did not have intrinsic
activity (fig. 4) and the nicotine concentration was selected
from [3h]overflow experiment 1 (fig. 5). one control slice
was superfused with only nicotine, and a second control slice
was superfused without modafinil or nicotine.
for [3h]overflow experiments 4 and 5, total [3h]overflow
data were analyzed via 1-way rm-anova with  xxxd2550xxx  concentration and modafinil concentration as withinsubject factors, respectively.

and amphetamine were initially examined in the rats used in the
present drug discrimination experiments. these data and a
detailed description of the acquisition of stimulus control are
presented and described in our earlier manuscript (cunningham
et al., 2006). briefly, there was a significant difference among
the stimulus groups in the session in which stimulus control was
achieved. rats in the amphetamine stimulus group achieved
stimulus control faster (median = 26 sessions) than rats in the 1.6
and 5 mg/kg cocaine stimulus groups (median values = 41 and
35 sessions, respectively). there were no significant differences
between the two cocaine stimulus groups.

rats were administered 32, 64 or 128 mg/kg modafinil or
vehicle and then placed in the operant chamber after a 10, 30,
60, 120 and 240 min delay to determine if modafinil substitutes
for the discriminative stimulus. the dose-response curves for
the cocaine groups are presented in fig. 1 and the curves for the
amphetamine group are presented in fig. 2.
analysis of response rate data revealed significant main
effects of modafinil dose (f(2,28) = 21.32, p b 0.001) and time

117

(f(4,56) = 8.42, p b 0.001). the modafinil dose × time interaction was not significant, and there were no significant
differences in response rates among the three discriminative
stimulus groups. post hoc tests determined that, overall,
response rates were higher after administration of 64 and
128 mg/kg modafinil, than after administration of 32 mg/kg
modafinil or vehicle. also, response rates were lower at the
10 min point than at the 60, 120 or 240 min time points.
response rates at the 30 min time point were not significantly
different from rates at any of the other time points, and there
were no differences among the 60, 120 or 240 min time points.
regarding the percentage of responses on the cocaine- or
amphetamine-paired levers, vehicle did not substitute for any of
the three stimuli at any time point. the 32 mg/kg modafinil dose
did not substitute for either cocaine discriminative stimuli or for
the amphetamine discriminative stimulus at any time point. the
64 mg/kg modafinil dose substituted partially for the 1.6 mg/kg
cocaine stimulus at the 30, 60 and 120 min time points, and for
the amphetamine sd at the 120 min time point. the 64 mg/kg
modafinil dose did not substitute for the 5 mg/kg cocaine
stimulus at any time point. the 128 mg/kg modafinil dose
substituted partially for the 1.6 mg/kg cocaine stimulus at the 60
and 120 min time points. the 128 mg/kg modafinil dose

discriminative stimulus for delivery of a food pellet. on an interaction test, rats were administered 32 mg/kg modafinil followed 50 min later by cocaine or
amphetamine. after a 10 min delay, rats were placed in the operant chamber. the top panels represent the mean (±s.e.m.) percentage of responses on the cocaine- or

this indicates that modafinil did not alter the cocaine doseresponse curves for this cocaine dose.
for the amphetamine stimulus group, when rats were

of cocaine and amphetamine
in the interaction tests, rats were administered modafinil
(32 mg/kg) or vehicle followed by cocaine or amphetamine and
these data are presented in fig. 3. regarding response rate data,
the main effect of modafinil dose was not significant, and there
were no significant differences in response rates among the
three discriminative stimulus groups.
regarding the percentage of responses on the drug-paired
lever, when rats in the 1.6 mg/kg cocaine stimulus group were
administered vehicle before cocaine, the ed50 value for cocaine
was 0.85 mg/kg. however, the ed50 value for cocaine was
0.13 mg/kg when rats were administered modafinil before
cocaine. there was no significant difference in the slope of the
lines between the absence (mean = 44%/mg, s.e.m. = ±10%/mg)
and presence (mean = 38%/mg, s.e.m. = ± 9%/mg) of modafinil
pretreatment. there was a significant difference in the intercepts
between the absence (mean = 4%, s.e.m. = ± 3%) and presence
(mean = 26%, s.e.m. = ± 23%) of modafinil pretreatment (t(38) =

the cocaine dose-response curve to the left.
for the 5 mg/kg cocaine stimulus group, identical ed50

3.4. modafinil, amphetamine and nicotine evoke [3h]overflow
in [3h]overflow experiment 1, the concentration-response
profile for modafinil to evoke [3h]overflow from rat striatal
slices preloaded with [3h]dopamine was determined. total [3h]
overflow and fractional [3h] release (i.e., the time course) are
presented in fig. 4. regarding the measure of total [3h]
overflow, a significant main effect of modafinil concentration
was found (f(6,48) = 5.47, p b 0.001). post hoc tests revealed
that [3h]overflow was greater in the presence of 100 and
300 mum modafinil than in the control condition (superfusion in
the absence of modafinil). regarding fractional [3h] release, a
significant modafinil concentration × time interaction was
found (f(114,912) = 5.15, p b 0.001). post hoc tests determined
that there was greater fractional [3h] release for 300 mum
modafinil than for control at the 16, 18 and 20 min time points.
there was greater fractional [3h] release for 100 mum than for
control at the 18 and 20 min time points. none of the other
modafinil concentrations significantly increased [3h] release,
relative to control, at any time point.
amphetamine-evoked [3h]overflow was also determined,
and fractional [3h] release data are presented in fig. 5. for the
total [3 h]overflow measure, a significant main effect of
amphetamine concentration was found (f(2,16) = 48.63,
p b 0.001). the 10 mum amphetamine concentration
(mean = 25.5%, s.e.m. = ± 3.1%) evoked more [3h]overflow
than the control condition (superfusion in the absence of
amphetamine; mean = 0.4%, s.e.m. = ± 0.4%). similarly, there
was greater overflow in the presence of 1 mum amphetamine
(mean = 3.4%, s.e.m. = ± 1.6%) than in the control. regarding
fractional [3h] release, a significant amphetamine concentration × time interaction was found (f(38,304) = 31.07,
p b 0.001). post hoc tests determined that there was greater

slices preloaded with [3h]dopamine. experiments were conducted in the absence
and presence of  xxxd2746xxx  (0 or 10 mum, respectively). rat striatal slices were
superfused with buffer 75 min. subsequently, modafinil was added for 6 min, and
then slices were superfused with buffer that did not contain modafinil for 20 min.
due to differences between the control condition (superfusion in the absence of
modafinil) in the presence and absence of modafinil, total [3h]overflow data were
calculated as a percent of the respective control (total [3h]overflow data are presented
in table 1). data in the figure represent the mean (±s.e.m.) percent of control
measure. asterisks denote a significant difference from the 0 mum  xxxd2746xxx

amphetamine (1 or 3 mum) was added for 6 min, and then slices were superfused
with buffer that did not contain modafinil or amphetamine for 14 min. the top

significantly greater fractional [3h] release for the 1 mum
amphetamine concentration than for the control at the 20 min
time point.
the effect of nicotine was determined, and fractional [3h]
release data are presented in fig. 5. analysis of total [3h]
overflow data revealed a significant main effect of nicotine
concentration (f(2,16) = 36.81, p b 0.001). post hoc tests
determined that the 100 mum nicotine concentration
(mean = 8.4%, s.e.m. = ± 1.2%) evoked more [3h]overflow
than the control condition (superfusion in the absence of
nicotine; mean = 0.4%, s.e.m. = ± 0.4%). also, there was
greater overflow in the presence of 10 mum nicotine
(mean = 1.1%, s.e.m. = ± 0.2%) than in the control. a
significant nicotine concentration × time interaction was
found for fractional [ 3 h] release ( f(38,304) = 36.71,
p b 0.001). post hoc tests determined that there was greater
[3h] release for the 100 mum nicotine concentration than for
control at the 14–24 min time points. there was greater [3h]
release for the 10 mum nicotine concentration than for the control
only at the 20 min time point.
3.5. modafinil-evoked [3h]overflow is diminished in the
presence of  xxxd2746xxx 
[3h]overflow experiment 2 determined the concentrationresponse profile for modafinil in the presence of  xxxd2746xxx .
total [3h]overflow data are presented in table 1. a significant
main effect of modafinil concentration was found (f(6,48) =3.46,
p b 0.001) and post hoc tests determined that 300 mum modafinil
significantly increased [3h]overflow, relative to the control
condition (superfusion in the absence of modafinil). regarding
fractional [3h] release, the modafinil concentration × time
interaction was not significant.
a second series of analyses were performed to compare the
concentration-response curves for modafinil from [3h]overflow
experiments 1 and 2 (i.e., the concentration-response profile in
the absence and presence of  xxxd2746xxx ). as described, total
[3h]overflow data (table 1) were calculated as a percent of
control ([3h]overflow in the absence of modafinil). these
transformed data are presented in fig. 6. significant main effects
of modafinil concentration (f(6,96) = 6.96, p b 0.001) and
 xxxd2746xxx  concentration (f(1,16) = 14.64, p b 0.01), and a
significant interaction of modafinil concentration ×  xxxd2746xxx 
concentration (f(6,96) = 2.84, p b 0.05) were found. post hoc
comparisons determined that there was greater [3h]overflow in
the absence, than in the presence, of  xxxd2746xxx  at the 30, 100
and 300 mum modafinil concentrations.
3.6. modafinil diminishes amphetamine-evoked [3h]overflow
the effect of modafinil on amphetamine-evoked [3 h]
overflow was determined in [3 h]overflow experiment 3.
total [3 h]overflow and fractional [3 h] release are presented
in fig 7. regarding the measure of total [3 h]overflow,
significant main effects of amphetamine concentration (f

(1,7) = 19.50, p b 0.001) and modafinil concentration (f
(5,35) = 2.62, p b 0.05) and a significant amphetamine concentration × modafinil concentration interaction (f(5,35) =
3.07, p b 0.05) were found. consistent with our previous
experiment, amphetamine increased [ 3 h]overflow. overall, 1
and 3 mum amphetamine evoked greater [3 h]overflow than
superfusion with only buffer (control). regarding the
interaction of modafinil and amphetamine, the 0.01, 0.1, 10
and 30 mum modafinil concentrations significantly diminished
[3 h]overflow, relative to the control slice superfused only
with 1 mum amphetamine. only the 30 mum modafinil
concentration significantly diminished [ 3 h]overflow evoked
by the 3 mum amphetamine concentration.
with respect to the time course, significant main effects of
modafinil concentration (f(5,35) = 2.67, p b 0.05), time (f
(19,133) = 25.53, p b 0.001), amphetamine concentration (f
(1,7) = 10.54, p b 0.05), and an amphetamine concentration ×
modafinil concentration × time interaction (f(95,665) = 1.57,
p b 0.01) were found. for the 1 mum amphetamine concentration,
post hoc tests did not reveal significant differences among the
modafinil concentrations at any time point. for the 3 mum
amphetamine concentration, post hoc tests determined that there
was significantly less fractional [3h]overflow in the presence of
30 mum modafinil and amphetamine than in the control at the 26,
28 and 30 min time points. there was less [3h]overflow in the
presence of 1 and 10 mum modafinil and amphetamine than in the
control at the 28 min time point.
3.7.  xxxd2550xxx  does not alter modafinil-evoked [3h]
overflow
the effect of  xxxd2550xxx  on modafinil-evoked [3h]
overflow was determined. addition of 100 mum modafinil to buffer
increased total [3h]overflow (mean= 2.75%, s.e.m.= ±0.50%),
relative to the slice superfused in the absence of  xxxd2550xxx  and
modafinil (mean= 0.39%, s.e.m. = ±0.10%). however, 0.1 mum
(mean =2.03%, s.e.m. =±0.37%), 1 mum (mean = 2.99%, s.e.m. =
±0.42%) and 10 mum (mean =2.51%, s.e.m.= ±0.90%)  xxxd2550xxx  did not significantly alter this effect of modafinil.
3.8. modafinil does not alter nicotine-evoked [3h]overflow
the effect of modafinil on nicotine-evoked [3 h]overflow
was determined. addition of nicotine (10 mum) increased total
[3 h]overflow (mean = 2.09%, s.e.m. = ± 0.72%), relative to
the slice superfused without nicotine (mean = 0.02%, s.e.m. =
± 0.02%). however, 0.1 mum (mean = 1.48%, s.e.m. =
± 0.50%), 1 mum (mean = 1.54%, s.e.m. = ± 0.45%), 10 mum
(mean = 1.41%, s.e.m. = ± 0.27%), and 30 mum (mean = 1.65%,
s.e.m. = ± 0.99%) modafinil did not significantly alter this
effect of nicotine.
4. discussion
the present study investigated modafinil, a clinically used
psychostimulant that is reported to have relatively-low abuse
potential, in behavioral and neurochemical assays (warot et al.,

m.m. dopheide et al. / european journal of pharmacology 568 (2007) 112–123

1993; gold and balster, 1996; jasinski and kovacevicristanovic, 2000; myrick et al., 2004). despite modafinil's
clinical successes and its efficacy to alter behavior in the
preclinical laboratory, the mechanism of action for modafinil in
brain has not been clearly defined.
the drug discrimination procedure was used to measure the
subjective properties of modafinil in rats that were trained to
discriminate cocaine or amphetamine from vehicle. the drug
discrimination assay can be used as a behavioral test to
investigate drug mechanism (colpaert, 1999), and the use of
amphetamine and cocaine allowed for the interaction of
modafinil with a typical  xxxg2149xxx  substrate and
inhibitor respectively, to be determined. the rats in the 1.6 mg/
kg cocaine stimulus group were trained with a cocaine dose that
is markedly lower than the dose range (∼10 mg/kg) typically
used in rat drug discrimination experiments (schechter, 1997).
our previous research (cunningham et al., 2006) and the
present substitution and interaction tests revealed differences
between the two cocaine stimulus groups. in the present
substitution tests when rats were administered vehicle followed
by different cocaine doses, the cocaine dose-response curve for
the 1.6 mg/kg cocaine stimulus group (ed50 value = 0.85 mg/
kg) was to the left of the curve for the 5 mg/kg cocaine stimulus
group (ed50 value = 1.4 mg/kg). also, the threshold cocaine
dose for partial and full substitution was higher for the 5 mg/kg
cocaine stimulus group than for the 1.6 mg/kg cocaine stimulus
group. overall, these data indicate that a unique subjective state
was induced by the 1.6 and 5 mg/kg cocaine doses.
the 64 and 128 mg/kg modafinil doses increased response
rates, relative to responding after administration of vehicle or
32 mg/kg modafinil. the increase is consistent with other
animal research (edgar and seidel, 1997) and the classification
of modafinil as a psychostimulant. other studies determined
that modafinil doses greater than 128 mg/kg produced a
decrease in behavior (gold and balster, 1996). this modafinil
dose-dependent increase and then decrease in response rates
results in an “inverted-u” curve that has been observed for other
psychostimulants (branch, 1984; harland et al., 1989).
modafinil only partially substituted for the cocaine or
amphetamine discriminative stimulus. the substitution was
time-dependent and most pronounced 60–120 min after
modafinil administration. the majority of the responses were
performed on the saline-paired lever early (10 min) and late
(240 min) after modafinil administration. the partial substitution also was modafinil dose dependent. there was greater
substitution of modafinil to the 1.6 mg/kg cocaine dose than to
the 5 mg/kg cocaine dose. gold and balster (1996) reported
only partial substitution of modafinil (150–250 mg/kg) for rats
trained with a stimulus of 10 mg/kg cocaine. for the present
research, 128 mg/kg modafinil was the upper bound of doses
examined, and full substitution might have been observed if
higher (n 128 mg/kg) doses were tested. however, it is
important to note that at doses above 128 mg/kg, modafinil
decreased response rates (gold and balster, 1996), and it would
be difficult to attribute substitution to a specific modafinil effect.
considered overall, these data suggest that modafinil produces a
subjective state that is only slightly similar to cocaine and

121

amphetamine in rodents. in human studies, modafinil produced
an interoceptive state distinct from these stimulants (warot et
al., 1993; rush et al., 2002). overall, this pattern is consistent
with the classification of modafinil as a mild psychostimulant.
the 32 mg/kg modafinil dose, which did not substitute for
the amphetamine or cocaine discriminative stimulus, augmented the interoceptive properties of amphetamine and the 1.6 mg/
kg cocaine dose in the interaction test. pretreatment with
modafinil shifted the dose-response curve ∼ 6-fold to the left for
cocaine and ∼ 3-fold for amphetamine. thus, a modafinil dose,
which did not substitute for the state induced by amphetamines
or cocaine, enhanced the psychological state produced by the
more-potent psychostimulants. this effect of modafinil to
augment the stimulus properties of cocaine and amphetamine
had not been reported. the 32 mg/kg modafinil dose that
produced the shift in the dose-response curve is lower than the
threshold dose range to observe changes in dopamine activity
brain (ferraro et al., 1996; nishino et al., 1998). as such, it is
possible that the low-dose interactions are not dopaminemediated, a finding germane to the present [3h]overflow
research.
modafinil (≥100 mum) evoked [3h]overflow from rat striatal
slices in a concentration-dependent manner. research on the effect
of modafinil to increase extracellular levels is controversial. in
some in vivo assays, modafinil (64–256 mg/kg) did not increase
extracellular dopamine levels (akaoka et al., 1991; de sereville et
al., 1994) and inhibited the activity of midbrain dopamine neurons
(korotkova et al., 2007). also, a relatively-low modafinil
concentration (10 mum) did not evoke [3h]dopamine release from
mouse striatal synaptosomes (simon et al., 1995). however, the
present results are consistent with in vivo microdialysis experiments in which administration of a behaviorally-active modafinil
dose (100 mg/kg, p.o. or 5 mg/kg, i.v.) increased extracellular
dopamine concentrations (ferraro et al., 1996; nishino et al., 1998).
interestingly, the results from these latter studies, in which systemic
modafinil administration increased dopamine levels and/or altered
transporter function, suggest that the present [3h]overflow analysis
investigated modafinil concentrations that would be active in
behavioral assays (such as the present drug experiment experiments) at higher doses (64–128 mg/kg).
modafinil was compared to amphetamine and nicotine in the
[3h]overflow assay. the threshold concentrations for amphetamine and nicotine were 1 and 10 mum, respectively, while the
threshold concentration for modafinil was 100 mum. although
the effect of higher ( xxxd1338xxx  mum) amphetamine concentrations was
not determined, overall comparison of the data with the three
drugs suggests that modafinil evoked much less [3h]dopamine
than nicotine or amphetamine. thus, the present research
indicates that modafinil evokes dopamine, but it is less potent
and efficacious than other psychostimulants. this low in vitro
potency and efficacy may explain why relatively-high
(≥ 100 mg/kg, p.o. or 5 mg/kg, i.v.) modafinil doses are
necessary to observe a change in behavior (gold and balster,
1996; edgar and seidel, 1997; beracochea et al., 2001).
modafinil, at concentrations (≤30 mum) that did not have
intrinsic activity, blocked the activity of the dopamine
transporter substrate amphetamine to evoke [3h]overflow.

122

m.m. dopheide et al. / european journal of pharmacology 568 (2007) 112–123

furthermore, the  xxxg2149xxx  inhibitor  xxxd2746xxx 
completely blocked the [3h]overflow evoked by 100 mum
modafinil and attenuated (∼55%) the [3h]overflow evoked by
300 mum modafinil. these results suggest that modafinil has
affinity for the transporter and that the effect of modafinil to
evoke dopamine release is mediated by the dopamine
transporter. this finding is in contrast to a recent report in
which  xxxd2746xxx  (1 mum) did not interfere with the effect of
modafinil (50 mum) to inhibit firing of midbrain dopamine
neurons (korotkova et al., 2007). however, the present results
are consistent with modafinil's affinity for the dopamine
transporter in several binding assays (mignot et al., 1994;
nishino et al., 1998; madras et al., 2006). modafinil has been
considered to be a  xxxg2149xxx  inhibitor (mignot et al.,
1994), like cocaine or bupropion.  xxxg2149xxx 
inhibitors have affinity for the transporter, but are ineffective
to evoke dopamine release from neurons (chen and reith,
2002). for example, in our preliminary experiments, cocaine
(≤100 mum) and bupropion (≤ 10 mum) did not evoke [3h]
overflow from striatal slices. as a substrate, amphetamine has
an affinity for the transporter, but alters transporter function and
evokes dopamine release (sulzer et al., 2005). in our
experiment, amphetamine was efficacious to evoke [3 h]
overflow, as was modafinil. taken together, our data suggest
that modafinil is a substrate for the  xxxg2149xxx .
however, the efficacy and potency of modafinil is much weaker
than that of amphetamine. this finding of weak substrate
activity agrees with recent electrophysiological work in
midbrain dopamine neurons (korotkova et al., 2007), although
korotkova and colleagues suggest that an interaction with d2
dopamine receptors is the primary target for modafinil.
regarding the comparison of the present behavioral and
neurochemical results, higher modafinil doses (64–128 mg/kg)
substituted for the amphetamine or cocaine discriminative stimulus,
which is consistent with the efficacy of higher modafinil
concentrations (≥100 mum) to evoke [3h]overflow. for lower
modafinil doses and concentrations, there appears to be an
inconsistency between the behavioral and neurochemical findings.
a low modafinil dose (32 mg/kg) augmented the discriminative
stimulus properties of amphetamine, but lower modafinil concentrations (≤30 mum) blocked amphetamine-evoked [3h]overflow.
the reason for this dichotomy is not known. however, it is unclear
if the effects of the lower modafinil dose on behavior are strictly
related to a change in brain dopamine levels, as this low dose was
ineffective in in vivo microdialysis experiments studying extracellular dopamine levels (akaoka et al., 1991; de sereville et al.,
1994), and lower concentrations were ineffective to evoke [3h]
overflow. also, although the present research indicates that
modafinil alters the function of the  xxxg2149xxx , research
on modafinil also suggests a role for orexin receptors, adrenoceptors and serotonin receptors (ballon and feifel, 2006). modafinil
may also regulate the activity of dopamine neurons indirectly,
through regulation of norepinephrine neurons or d2 dopamine
receptors (wisor and eriksson, 2005; korotkova et al., 2007).
modafinil and nicotine similarly reduce fatigue, increase
alertness and have cognitive-enhancing effects. nicotine
increases extracellular dopamine concentrations, and this effect

of nicotine is maximally inhibited by  xxxd2550xxx  (teng
et al., 1997; mansvelder et al., 2002). as such, it was of interest
to determine if modafinil interacts with nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors, similar to nicotine.  xxxd2550xxx , within the
concentration range where it completely inhibits nicotineevoked [ 3 h]overflow (teng et al., 1997), did not alter
modafinil-evoked [3h]overflow. this indicates that modafinilevoked [3h]overflow is not mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors. the interaction of modafinil with nicotine-evoked
[3h]overflow also was determined. modafinil did not augment
or inhibit the effect of nicotine, indicating further that modafinil
does not interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.
modafinil's interaction with nicotinic acetylcholine receptorselective ligands was not examined in the present drug
discrimination study. while the present [3h]overflow data are
“negative”, they are significant considering modafinil's multifaceted interaction with multiple molecular targets in brain (e.g.,
adrenoceptors, orexin receptors and serotonin receptors).
modafinil is approved for the treatment of sleep disorders,
and has demonstrated efficacy for other psychopathologies,
including treating the withdrawal syndrome from psychostimulant dependence (dackis et al., 2003; nasr, 2004; dackis et al.,
2005; ballon and feifel, 2006; krebs et al., 2006). the present
findings suggest that the clinical efficacy of modafinil may be
related to its interaction with the  xxxg2149xxx . our data
indicate that modafinil evokes dopamine release from striatal
neurons. although this research did not address directly the
reinforcing or addictive properties of modafinil, these results do
support previous findings in humans and animals that modafinil
has a low abuse liability (warot et al., 1993; gold and balster,
1996; jasinski and kovacevic-ristanovic, 2000; myrick et al.,
2004).
