 xxxd2242xxx  sulfate: a postganglionic sympathetic
inhibitor for the treatment of mild to
moderate hypertension
john d. palmer, ph.d., m.d., and charles a. nugent, m.d.
 xxxd2242xxx  sulfate is structurally and pharmacologically similar to  xxxd2243xxx  but has different
pharmacokinetic properties. the drug produces peripheral postganglionic sympathetic blockade as a
consequence of interference with neuronal release of norepinephrine and displacement of norepinephrine from storage vesicles. animal studies using large multiples of human antihypertensive doses
suggest a low order of human toxicity. clinical studies have failed to reveal any major effect on hematologic, hepatic or renal function. the effect on serum lipids and plasma renin is unknown. the drug is well
absorbed after oral administration. peak plasma levels in humans occur 1.5-2 hours after a administration. protein binding is less than 20%. data from animal studies and clinical trials demonstrating a lack of
central nervous system side effects indicate that little if any drug enters the central nervous system. the
drug is partially metabolized by the liver, but nearly 50% of an orally administered dose appears
unchanged in the urine. the mean elimination half-life is approximately 12 hours.
the onset of antihypertensive action after oral administration of  xxxd2242xxx  to humans is 30-1 20
minutes (mean 77 minutes). the offset of drug action after a single oral dose ranges between 4-14 hours
(mean 9 hours). the hypotensive response to  xxxd2242xxx  in hypertensive subjects is the result of a
decline in systemic vascular resistance with an impairment of the normal sympathetic reflexes in the
erect position.  xxxd2242xxx  causes a reduction in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate in the erect
position. open label clinical trials of antihypertensive efficacy indicate that  xxxd2242xxx  is effective in 60
and 70% of patients in the supine and erect positions, respectively. in comparative clinical trials,
 xxxd2242xxx  appears to be as effective as  xxxd2243xxx  or methyldopa in reducing blood pressure in
persons with mild to moderately severe hypertension; mean doses ranged from 56-1 62 mgiday. in other
studies, investigators have used doses of 5-600 mg daily. the maximum recommended dosage is 400
mg/day. side effects reported with  xxxd2242xxx  administration are those that would be predicted for a
postganglionic sympathetic inhibitor that does not enter the central nervous system. sexual dysfunction,
orthostatic dizziness and diarrhea occur with the drug but do not seem to be as frequent or as severe as
with  xxxd2243xxx  administration. in a comparison of  xxxd2242xxx  to methyldopa, methyldopa caused more
complaints of drowsiness, and drowsiness scores of methyldopa patients remained higher than those of
 xxxd2242xxx  patients even after two years of therapy. the drug has received approval as a step 2
antihypertensive agent in the united states. the available data suggest that it will serve as a reasonable
alternative to other step 2 antihypertensives. (pharmacotherapy 1983;3:22&229)

conclusions

evaluation of  xxxd2242xxx  sulfate
 xxxd2242xxx  sulfate is one of a group of guanidine
derivatives that have been extensively studied for
their antihypertensive actions. it is an orally effective,
potent, postganglionic sympathetic blocking agent
that is structurally and pharmacologically similar to
 xxxd2243xxx . the drug was recently marketed in the
united states by pennwalt pharmaceuticals under
the trade name of hylorep:.  xxxd2242xxx  was developed by the upjohn company who licensed the drug
to pennwalt.  xxxd2242xxx  has been classified by the
food and drug administration as a step 2 antihypertensive agent. it has been compared to other step 2
antihypertensive drugs in a number of clinical trials.
chemical properties

the chemical name of  xxxd2242xxx  sulfate is [l , 4dioxaspiro (43) decan-2-ylmethyl] guanadine sulfate. a structural comparison of  xxxd2242xxx  and  xxxd2243xxx  is shown in figure 1.
 xxxd2242xxx  sulfate is soluble in water to the extent
of 70 mg/ml. the drug is marketed as scored 10 and
25 mg tablets.

species of experimental animals. this action is not
uniform, however, from species to species or tissue
to tissue.‘ in the dog, the initial oral or intravenous
dose of  xxxd2242xxx  causes a transient increase in
blood pressure secondary to an increase in systemic
vascular resistance and cardiac output (upjohn
data). it is thought that this hypertensive response is
a consequence of the displacement of norepinephrine from postganglionic sympathetic neuronal storage sites. this response is blocked by alpha-adrenergic blocking agents. intravenous  xxxd2243xxx 
produces a similar pressor response.’
 xxxd2242xxx  is an orally effective hypotensive drug
in normotensive and grollman hypertensive dogs
(upjohn data). the blood pressure is lowered as a
result of a decrease in systemic vascular resistance.
cardiac output is unchanged. the minimum effective
hypotensive dose in normal dogs is approximately 6
mgikg, and the maximum effective dose is approximately 25 mg/kg. when 30 mg/kg per day was given
to normal dogs for 14 days, the mean arterial blood
pressure was lowered by 9-18%. there were no
adverse effects on renal function in conscious normotensive dogs.6

mechanism of action

toxicology

the mechanism of action of  xxxd2242xxx  is similar to
that of  xxxd2243xxx .’ the primary antihypertensive
action is due to an interference with neuronally mediated release of norepinephrine. as with  xxxd2243xxx , chronic administration is associated with
depletion of postganglionic neuronal stores of norepinephrine.’, animal studies have shown that
 xxxd2242xxx  causes a postganglionic sympathetic
blockade since there is a block of: (a) the characteristic response to carotid occlusion, (b) contraction of
the nictitating membrane in response to pre and
postganglionic electrical stimulation, (c) the blood
pressure response to thoracic sympathetic or
splanchnic nerve stimulation, and (d) the pressor response to tyramine (upjohn company, data on file,
kalamazoo, mi). in addition,  xxxd2242xxx  has been
shown to deplete norepinephrine stores in several

there is, as yet, no information on human overdose.
chronic toxicity
chronic toxicity studies lasting 6 weeks to a year
have been conducted in rats given oral  xxxd2242xxx  in
doses ranging from 15 to 400 mg/kg/day (upjohn

data). in the rat, there tended to be a slight increase
in the weight of the prostate and the adrenal glands
in males and a mild elevation of sgpt. in a twelve
week oral toxicity study in rats, kidney weights were
lighter in treated females than in controls. there
were no other gross or microscopic changes. a 22
month oral study in rats failed to show evidence of
toxicity.  xxxd2242xxx  given in combination with hydrochlorothiazide to rats did not cause adverse drugrelated clinical signs, hematologic changes or gross
or microscopic tissue changes.
chronic toxicity studies were conducted in dogs
for 6, 12 and 52 weeks (upjohn data). in a 6 week
oral study using doses of 25, 75 and 225 mg/kg/day,
the dogs receiving the highest dose all died within
the first week. at autopsy, all had subendocardial
hemorrhages. in dogs given 16, 50, or 150 mg/kg/
day orally for 12 weeks, indications of drug activity
included lethargy, scleral injection and relaxed nictitating membranes. loose stools, vomiting and diarrhea were seen occasionally throughout the course
of the study. food consumption was similar in control
and treated animals; however, weight gain values
were lower in a dose-related fashion for the treated
dogs as compared to controls. clinical pathologic
determinations and post-mortem examinations did
not indicate any significant evidence of drug-induced
toxicity. a one year study in dogs given oral doses of
3, 10 and 30 mg/kg each day gave results similar to
those of the 12 week study described above.  xxxd2242xxx , 30 or 100 mg/kg/day, given orally for one month
in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, did not produce any clinical or gross pathologic signs of toxicity
in dogs. evidence of pharmacologic actions as described previously were noted. approximately 50%
of the dogs given the antihypertensive and diuretic
combination lost weight. this was attributed to a diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide. the remainder
of the dogs either gained weight or maintained body
weight. serum potassium in the dogs given the combination of  xxxd2242xxx  and hydrochlorothiazide was
slightly less than in the control animals. liver function was within normal limits though the sgot values were at the high end of the normal range.
reproductive studies
a variety of teratology studies utilizing doses of the
order of several multiples of the proposed human
dose have been conducted in rats (upjohn data).
 xxxd2242xxx  30 and 100 mg/kg/day did not affect the
duration of gestation and there was a low incidence
(5/80) of visceral, soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities in the offspring of females given 100 mg/kg/day
doses. similar results were obtained in rabbits with
doses of 30 and 100 mg/kg/day.

pharmacokinetics
the results of studies of the disposition of  xxxd2242xxx  in humans and animals conducted by the upjohn company have not been published. the majority of the studies used a single oral dose of

 xxxd2242xxx . several multiple dose studies have been
conducted in humans. certain of these studies used
i4c labeled  xxxd2242xxx  or i4c and 3h labeled drug.
animal studies used mice, rats, dogs and monkeys.
absorption
 xxxd2242xxx  sulfate was well absorbed after oral
administration. peak plasma levels occurred 1.5-2
hours after administration. in humans, the relative
bioavailability of 25 and 50 mg compressed tablets
was 85% of that obtained from oral administration of
aqueous solutions of the drug. the peak plasma levels and time to peak plasma levels were not affected
by the dose form, i.e., compressed tablets or aqueous solutions.
distribution
the drug and its metabolites are extensively distributed in the body. organs with the highest concentration of drug-related material were harder’s gland
(a periorbital gland with oily secretions found in most
mammals but not in primates), and the submaxillary
and adrenal glands. the drug was absent or was
found in low concentration in the brain and eye and in
low concentrations in the fetus of the mouse.
protein binding
protein binding was less than 20% over a 100 fold
concentration range. thus, it is unlikely that  xxxd2242xxx  will be involved in clinically significant drug-protein displacement interactions.
metabolism
 xxxd2242xxx  is metabolized by the liver in man, but
nearly one half of an orally administered dose appears in the urine in unchanged form. humans and
the several animal species studied excrete a number
of metabolites, but only one of these, (2, 3-dihydroxypropyl) guanidine, has been identified (upjohn
data). the monkey and rat, but not the human or dog,
also excrete another, as yet, unidentified metabolite.
it is not known whether the metabolites retain antihypertensive activity.
half-life
in the human and dog, the sum of the unchanged
 xxxd2242xxx  and its metabolites disappear from the
peripheral circulation by a biexponential process
after oral administration (upjohn data). the half-lives
of  xxxd2242xxx  for the first and second phases were 14 hours and 5-45 hours in humans and 0.4-0.9
hours and 2-26 hours in dogs, respectively. when
using the total drug-related material, the average
half-lives for the first and second phases were 2
hours and 12 hours in humans and 1 hour and 15
hours in dogs, respectively. plasma levels of the unchanged drug and of total drug-related material during the second phase were usually 10% or less of the
peak plasma concentrations. the pharmacokinetic

evaluation of  xxxd2242xxx  sulfate
data best fit a 2-compartment, open model.
excretion
urinary excretion of an orally administered dose of
 xxxd2242xxx  is approximately 85% complete within 24
hours after administration. no data are available on
the effect of renal failure on drug levels.

human pharmacology
onset and offset of action
pascual and julius found that the onset of antihypertensive action of  xxxd2242xxx  after single oral doses
of 12.5-25 mg in seven subjects was 30-120 minutes, with a mean of 77 minute^.^ the offset of action
after a single dose in four of the above subjects was
between 4 and 14 hours with a mean of 9 hours. in
three of the seven patients, within 30-120 minutes
after the initiation of therapy there was a hypertensive response that lasted 60-90 minutes. a paradoxical increase in blood pressure has been noted after
intravenous administration of  xxxd2242xxx  or guanethithis response is caused by displacement of
norepinephrine from storage vesicles by the antihypertensive agent.
hemodynamics
cangiano and bloomfield performed hemodynamic and renal function studies in six hypertensive patients in the supine and erect positions and after 55"
head-up tilting.5the studies were conducted prior to
institution of drug therapy and 7 to 60 days after oral
 xxxd2242xxx  in daily doses of 75-400 mg (mean 162
mg). the hypotensive response was greater in magnitude in the erect than in the supine position. however, the reduction in both standing and lying blood
pressure was due to a significant fall in systemic
vascular resistance with no change in cardiac output,
stroke volume or heart rate. the hypotensive response to passive head-up tilting was associated
with a statistically significant decline in cardiac output and failure to appropriately increase systemic
vascular resistance, heart rate and stroke volume.
the hemodynamic responses to  xxxd2242xxx  are similar to those seen with  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors,
methyldopa and  xxxd2243xxx .- pascual and julius
compared the hemodynamic effects of  xxxd2242xxx 
and  xxxd2243xxx  in 8 hypertensive individual^.^
their findings are in general agreement with those of
cangiano and bl~omfield.~
there were no statistically significant differences between the two drug treated groups for changes in heart rate, mean blood
pressure, total peripheral resistance and cardiac index in either the recumbent position or five minutes
after head-up tilting to 45". it appears that the hypotensive response to  xxxd2242xxx  in hypertensive humans is a consequence of a decline in systemic vascular resistance and an impairment of the normal
sympathetic reflexes in the erect position such that
there is a decline in cardiac output with a less than

palmer and nugent

223

appropriate increase in heart rate, stroke volume and
systemic vascular resistance. as with  xxxd2243xxx ,
the hypotensive response is exaggerated when the
patient is tilted to an upright position. it is likely that
exercise or heat induced vasodilation will augment
the hypotensive response, though there are no published reports on this problem.
cangiano and bloomfield did not find significant
changes in renal hemodynamics in the supine posit i ~ nin
. ~the erect position, they noted a reduction in
renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate in five
of six patients. these observations, together with the
fact that approximately 50% of a  xxxd2242xxx  dose is
eliminated unchanged in the urine, suggest that
 xxxd2242xxx  must be used with caution in patients with
impaired renal function. however, no published data
are available on this topic.

antihypertensive efficacy
open label studies
bloomfield and cangiano conducted an open-labe1 study in 16 black women and 4 black men with
moderate to severe hypertension (diastolic pressure
110-1 48 mm hg).4sixty percent of the patients were
judged to have an excellent to good response in the
supine position and seventy-five percent in the erect
position. excellent response was defined as a drop
in mean blood pressure of 20 mmhg, good response
was an 11-1 9 mmhg decline, and poor was a drop in
mean blood pressure of 10 mmhg or less.  xxxd1680xxx  50 to 200 mg per day was added to the  xxxd2242xxx  regimen in the 8 patients judged to have a poor
response in the supine position. the result was an
excellent to good response in six of these patients
while in the supine position and seven while erect.
though the number of patients is small, this initial
study demonstrated that  xxxd2242xxx  is an effective
antihypertensive agent alone or with a diuretic in
patients with moderate to severe hypertension.
dunn and dunlap have reported on the antihypertensive efficacy of  xxxd2242xxx  in an open-label, multicenter study.gthe drug was evaluated in 199 outpatients by 11 investigators. patients with consistent
supine diastolic blood pressures from 95 to 120
mmhg, whose blood pressure was not controlled
with hydrochlorothiazide alone, were enrolled in a
three-month study. the goal of treatment was to reduce blood pressure to 140/85 mmhg or less in
those aged 40 years or younger and to at least 150/
95 for those over 40 years. by week 12, over 63% of
the patients had achieved goal blood pressure control in the supine position. seventy-fivepercent of the
patients were considered to be under good control
when standing blood pressures were taken.
comparison of  xxxd2242xxx  to  xxxd2243xxx 
bloomfield and cangiano compared  xxxd2242xxx  to
 xxxd2243xxx  in 40 patients using a modified doubleblind
age ranged from 33 to 71; there

224

1983

were 34 women and 6 men.  xxxd2242xxx  was given in
daily doses of 30-400 mg for an average of 17
weeks.  xxxd2243xxx  was given in doses of 10-200
mg daily for an average of 14 weeks. responses
were judged as excellent when the mean blood pressure (diastolic plus one third of the pulse pressure)
was reduced 20 mmhg or more or when the patient
was normotensive,good when the mean blood pressure was reduced more than 10 mmhg but less than
20 mmhg, and poor when the mean blood pressure
was reduced less than 10 mmhg.  xxxd2242xxx  produced excellent to good responses in 12 patients
(60%) in the supine position and in 15 patients (75%)
in the erect position.  xxxd2243xxx  produced excellent to good responses in 11 patients (55%) in the
supine position and in 14 patients (70%) in the erect
position.
chrysant and frohlich used a modified, doubleblind technique to compare the antihypertensive effectiveness of  xxxd2242xxx  and  xxxd2243xxx  in 12
patientswith moderate to severe essential hypertension.” their patients all had blood pressures over
151/99 mmhg in the supine position and all were
receiving diuretics. ages ranged from 37 to 60 years.
ten of the twelve subjects were men. the initial and
maximum doses for both drugs were 20 and 400 mg/
day, respectively. the treatment goal was reduction
of arterial pressure to 150/95 mmhg or less in either
the supine or standing position.  xxxd2243xxx  lowered the blood pressure in all patients studied. the
stated goal was met in four of seven patients in the
supine position and in five of the seven in the erect
position. the mean  xxxd2243xxx  dose was 90 mg/
day. while  xxxd2242xxx  lowered the blood pressure in
all patients treated, only one of five achieved a reduction in blood pressure to at least 150/90 mmhg in
the supine position, and three of five achieved the
desired therapeutic goal in the erect position. the
daily dose of  xxxd2242xxx  averaged 72 mg. the results
show that both drugs were capable of reducing blood
pressure in individuals with moderate to severe hypertension: a comparison of relative efficacy was
precluded by the small number of subjects.
hansson et al have compared  xxxd2242xxx  and
 xxxd2243xxx  in a single-blind, crossover study in 13
patients with essential hypertension who were receiving chlorothiazide 50 mg twice daily.12 patients
were randomized to receive either  xxxd2242xxx  or
 xxxd2243xxx  along with chlorothiazide for two periods of six weeks. the two drug treatment periods
were separated by a two week period of placebo
washout in which chlorothiazide was the only active
drug received. in comparison to placebo, both antihypertensive drugs caused a statistically significant
and similar reduction of blood pressure in the supine
and erect positions with the exception of the afternoon blood pressure values of the patients on  xxxd2243xxx , which did not significantly differ from those
of the patients on placebo. the results suggest that
blood pressure control throughout the day was
slightly better with  xxxd2242xxx  than with  xxxd2243xxx 

due to the afternoon rise in blood pressure with
 xxxd2243xxx . the authors state that this difference
may be due to the shorter half-lifeof  xxxd2242xxx  which
led them to give the drug three times daily rather than
once daily as with  xxxd2243xxx .
comparison of  xxxd2242xxx  to methyldopa
mcmahon et al compared  xxxd2242xxx  and methyldopa in a two year, randomizedstudy of 40 hypertensive patients.l3 baseline mean arterial pressures
were 132 and 134 mmhg when supine and 133 and
135 mm hg when erect for the  xxxd2242xxx  and methyldopa treated patients, respectively. drug dosage
was increased until patients’ mean arterial pressure
was reduced to less than 107 mmhg supine and less
than 113 mmhg when erect. hydrochlorothiazide
was added to the treatment regimen when the goal
was not reached with the maximum dose of  xxxd2242xxx  400 mg/day or methydopa 3 g/day. only two
patients in each treatment group reached their therapeutic goal without the use of thiazides. the authors
failed to report the number of subjects achieving the
therapeutic goal with drug and diuretic, though the
pooled data showed a reduction of mean arterial
blood pressure to at least the stated goal in the supine position.
mroczek reported in an abstract the results of a
randomized, open-label comparison of methyldopa
and  xxxd2242xxx  conducted in 22 centers.14the results
are summarized in table 3 and are similar to those
reported by nugent et ai.l5
nugent et al reported the results of a multicenter
two year study of 547 patients randomly assigned to
treatment with  xxxd2242xxx  or methy1d0pa.l~ninetyeight percent of the patients had essential hypertension that was not controlled with hydrochlorothiazide
alone. all patients continued to take hydrochlorothiazide during the study. the goal of treatment was the
reduction of diastolic blood pressure in the supine
position to 90 mmhg or less. control was judged
good when there was a 75% decline in diastolic
blood pressure toward the goal, fair when there was
a 25 to 74% reduction, and poor when blood pressure response was less than 25% toward the stated
goal. both  xxxd2242xxx  and methyldopa promptly reduced the blood pressure and maintained a similar
degree of control of hypertension over the two year
period of the study. control as judged by the criteria
above was about equal between the two drugs.
there was good control in about 65% of the patients,
fair control in about 20% and poor control in about
10-1 5%. mean supine systolic pressure in patients
treated with methyldopa was slightly lower than that
of the patients treated with  xxxd2242xxx .

dosage
the mean doses of  xxxd2242xxx  used have ranged
from 56 to 162 mg per day (complete range, 5 to 600
mg per day). the maximal recommended dosage is

 xxxd2243xxx  or methyldopa yield some perspective
as to the relative potency of the drug. in the two
published comparisons of  xxxd2242xxx  and methyldopa, mean doses of the two drugs respectively
were 56 and 1134 mg/day and 61 and 1210 mg/
day.l4,l5in the published  xxxd2242xxx  and  xxxd2243xxx  comparisons, the mean doses of the respective
drugs were 83 and 62 mg/day, 72 and 90 mg/day and
70 and 57 m g / d a ~ . ~l2
~in the open label evaluation
by dunn et al, the doses at week 12 in 159 patients
were mean 58 mg, standard deviation 69.8 mg, median 40 mg and range 5-600 m g / d a ~the
. ~ spread of
doses observed for  xxxd2242xxx  is not unusual for
drugs likely to be used in step 2 antihypertensive
therapy. therapy is usually begun with a low dose
and titrated upward to an effective dose. in the comparison of  xxxd2242xxx  and methyldopa by nugent et
al,  xxxd2242xxx  was started  xxxd1891xxx  mg once a day and
then given twice a day when the total daily dose was
40-100 mg, three times a day when the total daily
dose was 100-225 mg, and four times a day when
daily doses over 225 mg were used.15 the mean
daily dose of  xxxd2242xxx  rose 20% from the end of the
first to the end of the second year; this suggests the
development of some tolerance that was compensated for by raising the dosage.15the mean methyldopa dosage was stable during the second year.
hansson and his co-workers noted a more stable
control of blood pressure when  xxxd2242xxx  was given
three times daily than with  xxxd2243xxx  given once
daily.’* morning to afternoon changes in supine and
standing diastolic blood pressure were greater with
 xxxd2243xxx  (p < 0.05).

study, but in only seven patients (3.5%) were the
side effects believed to be drug related. comparison
of the mean frequency of orthostatic faintness, diarrhea and sexual dysfunction over the duration of
study to that reported at week 0 showed little or no
increase during the period of  xxxd2242xxx  treatment.
the frequency of fatigue and drowsiness did not significantly increase during the course of the study.
these authors noted that with the relatively low
doses of  xxxd2242xxx  required to manage mild to moderate hypertension, side effects, especially early
morning hypotension, diarrhea and sexual dysfunction, were infrequent. while detailed data are not
presented, the authors state that with patients with
more severe hypertension requiring larger doses of
 xxxd2242xxx , there were more frequent and severe
side effects.
analysis of side effects experienced when  xxxd2242xxx  was compared to  xxxd2243xxx  or methyldopa
provides an important frame of reference. nugent et
al, in reporting the results of a two year comparison
of  xxxd2242xxx  and methyldopa in 547 hypertensive
patients, evaluated side effects with a questionnaire.15patients were asked to rate the severity of 34
symptoms of central nervous, cardiorespiratory,
gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and genitourinary
systems on a scale of 0 to 4 (0 equaled absent, 1
equaled mild, 2 equaled moderate, 3 equaled severe
and 4 equaled intolerable). side effect scores were
calculated as frequency (percent) times severity (0 to
4). scores were calculated when the patients were
on diuretic alone and these values were subtracted
from scores calculated at later clinic visits. the differ-

side effects
side effects reported with  xxxd2242xxx  administration are, for the most part, those that would be predicted for a postganglionic sympathetic inhibitor that
does not enter the central nervous system. the limited number of patients studied and variations in study
design preclude precise documentation of side effect
frequency and severity. the multicenter open-label
study reported by dunn and dunlap depicts the
spectrum of side effects associated with  xxxd2242xxx 
(table 4).9side effects were assessed by means of a
questionnaire administered at each clinic visit by 199
outpatients over a 12 week period. adverse effects
prompted withdrawal of 13 patients (6.5%) from the

ence was defined as the measure of drug-induced
effect. the changes from pre-trial in the severity
scores for the side effects that might be expected in
patients receiving  xxxd2242xxx  or methyldopa appear
in figure 2. methyldopa caused more complaints of
drowsiness than  xxxd2242xxx  and the drowsiness
scores remained higher (p < 0.05) than those of the
 xxxd2242xxx  patients, even after two years of therapy.
complaints of orthostatic faintness, diarrhea, ejaculatory disturbances and change in libido were uncommon, and the severity scores did not differ significantly. methyldopatherapy was associated with a

somewhat higher incidence of impotence, but the
difference only bordered on statistical significance (p
= 0.059). complaints of orthostatic hypotension did
not differ in the two groups, though systolic, but not
diastolic, pressures declined more in the upright position in patients taking  xxxd2242xxx . other side effects
did not differ in the two treatment groups. thirty patients stopped taking  xxxd2242xxx  and 32 stopped taking methyldopa because of side effects (table 5).
the kinds of side effects that prompted withdrawal
from the trial and their frequencies in the two treatment groups were similar.
the multicenter, comparative evaluation of  xxxd2242xxx  and methyldopa reported by mroczek found that
the frequency of side effects from the two drugs was
similar, though the type of side effects was different.i4drowsiness occurred with a greater frequency
and severity in methyldopa patients, while orthostatic faintness, diarrhea and sexual impairment in men
were more frequent in the  xxxd2242xxx  patients. in a
two year comparison of  xxxd2242xxx  and methyldopa
in 40 hypertensive patients, mcmahon et al found no
significant differences in the incidence, duration and
severity of side effects in the two treatment program~.~~
comparison of the side effects caused by  xxxd2242xxx  and  xxxd2243xxx  is difficult because of the small
number of patients in the four published comparisons. in the modified, double-blind comparison of
two drugs in 40 patients conducted by bloomfield
and cangiano, weakness, dizziness, and diarrhea
occurred more frequently with  xxxd2243xxx .'o there
were only six men in the study and failure of ejaculation occurred in two of three receiving  xxxd2243xxx ,
but in none of three receiving  xxxd2242xxx . hansson
and pascual assessed side effects from  xxxd2242xxx

evaluation of  xxxd2242xxx  sulfate
blind crossover.12the total number of complaints on
 xxxd2242xxx  was 70, on  xxxd2243xxx  93 and on placebo 67. there were five complaints of dizziness while
taking  xxxd2242xxx , as compared to 12 after receiving
 xxxd2243xxx  and seven while on placebo. there
were three, six and two complaints of diarrhea during
treatment with  xxxd2242xxx ,  xxxd2243xxx , and placebo, respectively. both drugs generated ten complaints of ejaculatory failure. there were eight complaints of ejaculatory failure while on placebo. in the
hemodynamic comparisons of  xxxd2242xxx  and  xxxd2243xxx  in eight patients, pascual and julius found
that dizziness occurred mainly in the morning with
 xxxd2243xxx  and that there was no relationship to
the time of drug admini~tration.~
on the other hand,
the dizzziness that occurred in patients receiving
 xxxd2242xxx  occurred after the dose. chrysant and
frohlich reported a similar number of adverse effects
after  xxxd2242xxx  or  xxxd2243xxx  treatment in 12 hypertensive patients.’ in the seven patients treated
with  xxxd2243xxx , there were 19 complaints of adverse effects, while in the five  xxxd2242xxx -treated patients there were seven complaints. adverse effects
included orthostatic hypotension, muscle weakness,
diarrhea, nasal congestion, ejaculatory failure, nocturia and leg cramps. in the  xxxd2242xxx -treated patients, there were no complaints of orthostatic hypotension, nasal congestion or failure of ejaculation.

conclusions
 xxxd2242xxx  is a newly introduced guanidine derivative with antihypertensive actions similar to those of
 xxxd2243xxx . the drug differs importantly from
 xxxd2243xxx  in that it has consistent bioavailability
and an elimination half-life of approximately 12 hours
as compared to 5 days for  xxxd2243xxx .
open-label trials show that  xxxd2242xxx  is an effective antihypertensive agent when used in conjunction with a diuretic in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. the side effects encountered with
the use of  xxxd2242xxx  are those that would be predicted for a peripherally acting, postganglionic, sympathetic blocking drug. orthostatic faintness, diarrhea
and sexual dysfunction do occur, and while the number of patients studied thus far is relatively small,
these side effects seem to be infrequent and may not
be as troublesome as the side effects induced by
 xxxd2243xxx . the drug does not readily enter the
central nervous system; therefore, central nervous
system side effects are not encountered. the inter-

palmer and nugent

227

mediate elimination half-life should facilitate dose titration and permit once or twice a day dosing. the
effect of the drug on serum lipids and renin levels is
not known. there is as yet no report of tissue toxicity.
hemodynamic studies indicate that  xxxd2242xxx 
lowers blood pressure by reducing systemic vascular resistance with little effect on cardiac output.
whether or not  xxxd2242xxx  will have a favorable action in persons with occlusive arterial disease or congestive heart failure has not yet been assessed. the
available data suggest that  xxxd2242xxx  will serve as a
reasonable alternative to other step 2 antihypertensive agents, though there have been no direct comparisons to clonidine,  xxxd3000xxx  or the beta-adrenergic blocking drugs.
