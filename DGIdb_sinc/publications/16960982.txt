abstract
the human cardiovascular system is exposed to plasma 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht, serotonin), usually released from platelets. 5-ht can
produce harmful acute and chronic effects. the acute cardiac effects of 5-ht consist of tachycardia (preceded on occasion by a brief reflex
bradycardia), increased atrial contractility and production of atrial arrhythmias. acute inotropic, lusitropic and arrhythmic effects of 5-ht on
human ventricle become conspicuous after inhibition of phosphodiesterase (pde) activity. human cardiostimulation is mediated through  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors. atrial and ventricular  xxxg1695xxx  activity exerts a protective role against potentially harmful cardiostimulation.
chronic exposure to high levels of 5-ht (from metastatic carcinoid tumours), the anorectic drug fenfluramine and its metabolites, as well as
the ecstasy drug 3,4- xxxd2611xxx  (mdma) and its metabolite 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (mda) are associated with
proliferative disease and thickening of cardiac valves, mediated through 5-ht2b receptors. 5-ht2b receptors have an obligatory physiological role
in murine cardiac embryology but whether this happens in humans requires research. congenital heart block (chb) is, on occasion, associated
with autoantibodies against  xxxg1117xxx  receptors.
acute vascular constriction by 5-ht is usually shared by 5-ht1b and 5-ht2a receptors, except in intracranial arteries which constrict only
through 5-ht1b receptors. both 5-ht1b and 5-ht2a receptors can mediate coronary artery spasm but only 5-ht1b receptors appear involved in
coronary spasm of patients treated with triptans or with prinzmetal angina. 5-ht2a receptors constrict the portal venous system including
oesophageal collaterals in cirrhosis. chronic exposure to 5-ht can contribute to pulmonary hypertension through activation of constrictor 5-ht1b
receptors and proliferative 5-ht2b receptors, and possibly through direct intracellular effects.

1. introduction
serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-ht) exerts its multiplicity of physiological effects through an unsurpassed
diversity of receptors (hoyer et al., 1994, 2002). at least
14 different 5-ht receptors, each encoded by a separate gene,
are known in man and their roles in the human cardiovascular
system summarised in table 1. for some of these receptors,
additional diversity is achieved through alternative splicing,
rna editing or posttranslational modifications. furthermore,
polymorphic variants and mutants of serotonin receptors are
being unraveled, resulting in possible interindividual differences in their response to serotonin (göthert et al., 1998;
sanders-bush et al., 2003).
a multitude of effects of 5-ht have been demonstrated on
the cardiovascular system. some of these effects are mediated
through actions of 5-ht in the central nervous system, whereas
5-ht also has multiple and diverse effects through direct
interaction with 5-ht receptors in different parts of the
cardiovascular system. in each of these, for example different
blood vessels or different parts of the heart, the physiological
effects of 5-ht depend on the 5-ht receptors involved, the
intracellular signals evoked through these receptors, and their
cellular localisation. the aim of this review is to present a

comprehensive overview of the current knowledge about the
diverse effects of 5-ht on the human cardiovascular system,
with emphasis on the direct, peripheral effects, as opposed to
effects through the central nervous system, and to describe how
this knowledge translates into understanding and hypotheses
regarding the involvement of 5-ht and 5-ht receptors in the
pathogenesis and treatment of human cardiovascular disease.
particular emphasis will be put on the role of 5-ht in heart
disease and blood vessel disorders. we will also survey possible
effects of polymorphic 5-ht receptor variants and mutants for
human cardiovascular function.
2. molecular biology of 5-hydroxytryptamine
receptors relevant to the human cardiovascular system
the 14 different 5-ht receptors are divided into 7 groups (5ht1 through 5-ht7) based on molecular structure, signal
transduction properties and pharmacological properties (hoyer
et al., 1994, 2002).
2.1. the 5-ht1 group of receptors
the 5-ht1 group consists of 5 different receptors, 5-ht1a,
5-ht1b,  xxxg1110xxx ,  xxxg1111xxx  and  xxxg1112xxx . these receptors all
couple via the g protein gi with inhibition of adenylyl cyclase
as their primary signaling mechanism (raymond et al., 2001).
the genes encoding these receptors do not contain introns
within the open reading frame, and therefore splice variants do
not exist within this group. the  xxxg1108xxx  is mainly
located in the cns, and except for a possible role in rat renal
vasorelaxation (verbeuren et al., 1991), there is no evidence for
direct cardiovascular effects mediated through this receptor.
furthermore, evidence for localisation of this receptor in the
heart or blood vessels is also lacking. in contrast, the 5-ht1b
receptor is widely distributed in the cardiovascular system. the
 xxxg1109xxx , also previously known as 5-ht1dbeta (hartig et
al., 1992, 1996; hoyer et al., 2002) is found on both endothelial
cells and smooth muscle cells of several human vessels (ullmer
et al., 1995) including coronary and pulmonary artery (fig. 2).
the  xxxg1109xxx  is mainly implicated in vasoconstriction
(reviewed by kaumann et al., 1993). the cardiovascular role of
the  xxxg1110xxx  (also previously known as 5-ht1dalpha) is less
clear. messenger rna for  xxxg1110xxx  is generally less abundant
than for 5-ht1b, and is not found in endothelial cells or smooth
muscle cells from human blood vessel (ullmer et al., 1995).
however, the presence of this receptor in vascular nerves in the
adventitial tissue may explain why we detected  xxxg1110xxx  mrna
in human temporal and occipital arteries, while no function of
this receptor in contraction or relaxation of these arteries could
be demonstrated (verheggen et al., 1998, 2004). the 5-ht1b
receptors contribute to the vasocontriction elicited by 5-ht and
triptans in a variety of human arteries (section 4.1.1) and veins
(section 4.2). both 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors are targeted
by triptans, used to alleviate migraine attacks. 5-ht1b receptors
mediate both  xxxd3263xxx -evoked vasoconstriction (for reviews, see
kaumann et al., 1993; hall et al., 2004) and vasodilation
(elhusseiny & hamel, 2001). the effects of triptans through the

 xxxg1110xxx  are believed to represent neuronal effects (e.g.
inhibition of release of inflammatory neuropeptides; goadsby et
al., 2002).
the  xxxg1111xxx  will not be further discussed in this
review as there is no evidence of cardiovascular location or
effects of this receptor. the  xxxg1112xxx  on the other hand
may potentially be involved in the anti-migraine effect of at
least some of the triptans. however, this postulated effect is
believed to result from inhibition of neurogenic inflammation
but not from vasoconstriction (goldstein et al., 2001). the 5ht1f-selective agonist ly334370 (ki = 0.5 nm; wainscott et al.,
2005) does not significantly constrict large cerebral arteries
from the temporo-parietal region (shepheard et al., 1999) and
there was no correlation between the affinity of several agonists
for  xxxg1112xxx  receptors and contraction of the human middle
meningeal artery (razzaque et al., 1999).
recent evidence suggests that the molecularly elusive socalled 5-ht1p receptor found in the gut (gershon, 2005) may
represent an oligomeric form of the  xxxg1109xxx  through
interaction with either the d2 dopamine receptor (heterooligomers) or other 5-ht1b receptors (homooligomers; liu &
gershon, 2005). as yet, there is no evidence for this receptor
in the human cardiovascular system.
2.2. the 5-ht2 group of receptors
this receptor class contains 3 members, 5-ht2a, 5-ht2b and
5-ht2c (hoyer et al., 1994, 2002). these receptors couple
primarily via the g proteins gq or g11 to activation of
phospholipase (pl) c. as all the  xxxg1113xxx  genes contain
introns, additional receptor diversity due to alternative splicing
is possible. to date though, only non-functional truncated
variants of 5-ht2a (guest et al., 2000) and 5-ht2c (sandersbush et al., 2003; flomen et al., 2004) have been demonstrated,
whereas there is not yet any real evidence for alternative
splicing of human 5-ht2b receptors (bonhaus et al., 1995; kim
et al., 2000). the  xxxg1113xxx  is widespread in the human
cardiovascular system. it is present on arterial smooth muscle
(ullmer et al., 1995) and mediates vasoconstriction (reviewed
by kaumann et al., 1993; sections 4.1.1 and 4.2), whereas it is
absent on endothelial cells (ullmer et al., 1995). it is also
present on platelets and facilitates platelet aggregation (de
clerck et al., 1984; de chaffoy de courcelles et al., 1985). the
 xxxg1114xxx  mediates mitogenic signaling and may be
involved in pulmonary hypertension (section 5.3.2) as well as
valvulopathy (section 5.2.2.5). coupling of the 5-ht2b
receptor to the g protein g13 could also play a role (deraet et
al., 2005; section 5.1.2.2). the  xxxg1115xxx  has not been
found in the cardiovascular system.
2.3. the  xxxg1116xxx : a ligand-gated ion channel
the  xxxg1116xxx  is the only serotonin receptor which is
not a g protein-coupled receptor, but belongs to the cys-loop
family of receptors (kelley et al., 2003). it is a pentameric
ligand-gated cation channel similar to the nicotinic acetylcholine and gabaa receptors (boess et al., 1995). until recently, 2

a.j. kaumann, f.o. levy / pharmacology & therapeutics 111 (2006) 674–706

human  xxxg1116xxx  subunits had been cloned,  xxxg1116xxx 
(belelli et al., 1995; miyake et al., 1995) and 5-ht3b (davies et
al., 1999). however, 5 subunits of the human  xxxg1116xxx 
have now been cloned, adding to the molecular complexity of
this receptor family (niesler et al., 2003). although it is not
formally proven whether the native pentameric  xxxg1116xxx 
is a homopentamer or a heteropentamer, results from expression
of recombinant subunits indicate that heteromeric complexes
are more consistent with the properties of the native receptors
(davies et al., 1999; dubin et al., 1999). there is also evidence
for alternatively spliced human 5-ht3 receptors (brüss et al.,
1998). in the heart, the  xxxg1116xxx  is mainly believed to be
located on afferent vagal and sympathetic neurons, mediating
reflex bradycardia (section 3.1.1) and pain (section 5.2.2.3),

respectively. 5-ht3 receptors could also mediate a possible
reflex vasodilation in the human forearm. blauw et al. (1988)
showed that infusion of 5-ht into the radial artery of healthy
volunteers elicited forearm vasodilation, assessed with venous
plethysmography, that was prevented by the 5-ht3/ xxxg1117xxx 
antagonist  xxxd3451xxx . however, direct vasodilation through 5ht4 receptors has not been ruled out.
2.4. the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor—a tale of splice variants
the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor is positively coupled to the gs protein/
adenylyl cyclase system and, thus, camp formation (langlois &
fischmeister, 2003). the human  xxxg1117xxx  receptor exists in
multiple splice variants (fig. 1), which are identical up to leu-

358, followed by different c-terminal tails. these are named 5ht4(a),  xxxg1117xxx (b), etc., with the  xxxg1117xxx (i) splice variant as the most
recent addition to the list (brattelid et al., 2004a). a splice
variant with an internal insertion of 42 nt corresponding to 14
extra amino acids in the second extracellular domain was also
described and was called  xxxg1117xxx (hb) because it was only found in
combination with the  xxxg1117xxx (b) c-terminal tail (bender et al.,
2000). in the human cardiovascular system,  xxxg1117xxx  receptors are
present in cardiac atria (reviewed by kaumann & sanders, 1998;
sections 3.1 and 3.2.1) and ventricles (brattelid et al., 2004b;
section 3.2.2), where they mediate increases in contractility. 5ht4 receptors may also be expressed on human endothelial cells
(ullmer et al., 1995) but their function is still unknown. the
implications to cardiac function of this plethora of splice variants
remain unresolved, partly because of a lack of tools to address
this question. recent work suggests different coupling of  xxxg1117xxx 
(b) receptors, compared to  xxxg1117xxx (a) receptors (pindon et al.,
2002) or  xxxg1117xxx (d) receptors (castro et al., 2005); possible
implications for cardiac arrhythmias are discussed in section
5.2.2.1. other work, so far only with the mouse  xxxg1117xxx (a)
receptor, indicates that the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor can also activate g13,
resulting in activation of members of the rho family of small
gtpases (ponimaskin et al., 2002). this may open new avenues
of possible effects mediated through this receptor, perhaps also
in the cardiovascular system. so far, antibodies specific for
the different splice variants have not been available to
possibly determine the relative expression of the splice
variants at the protein level. in the heart, this expression is
also very low (b4 fmol mg protein−1 in human right atrium;
kaumann et al., 1996) and difficult to measure in binding
assays. therefore, the relative expression of the different
splice variants has only been inferred from quantitative rtpcr studies. although such studies with absolute quantification of message levels have not been performed, the study
of medhurst et al. (2001) has been interpreted to indicate that
the  xxxg1117xxx (b) splice variant is the dominant splice variant in all
human tissues examined, including human heart.
the nomenclature of the  xxxg1117xxx  splice variants is confusing,
especially since the human  xxxg1117xxx (g) variant was initially and is
still sometimes called  xxxg1117xxx (e). this is because of parallel and
independent discovery of novel  xxxg1117xxx  splice variants in mouse,
rat and man in the late 1990s, following the original discovery
of the rat  xxxg1117xxx (a) (initially called 5-ht4s) and  xxxg1117xxx (b)
(initially called 5-ht4l) by gerald et al. (1995). the human 5ht4(c) and  xxxg1117xxx (d) variants were cloned by blondel et al.
(1998). however, in parallel and independently, claeysen et al.
(1998) cloned 2 novel rodent splice variants and initially called
them  xxxg1117xxx (c) (cloned from both mouse and rat, with 13 aa after
the common sequence including leu-358) and  xxxg1117xxx (d) (cloned
from mouse; 5 aa after leu-358), and they also cloned a longer
human splice variant they called  xxxg1117xxx (e) (20 aa after leu-358).
to avoid confusion a revised nomenclature has unofficially
been adopted where the  xxxg1117xxx (c) and  xxxg1117xxx (d) names are
reserved for the human splice variants cloned by blondel et al.
(1998), and therefore the rodent  xxxg1117xxx (c) and  xxxg1117xxx (d) were
renamed to  xxxg1117xxx (e) and  xxxg1117xxx (f), respectively. thus, the
human variant originally called  xxxg1117xxx (e) had to be renamed to 5-

ht4(g). this is the nomenclature used to name the exons in and
splice variants derived from the human  xxxg1117xxx  gene as cloned
and published by bender et al. (2000). the gene contains
one continuous exon encompassing sequence corresponding
to the c-terminal tail of the rodent  xxxg1117xxx (e) and  xxxg1117xxx (f) and
the human  xxxg1117xxx (g) splice variants, but to our knowledge,
mrna encoding human  xxxg1117xxx (e) and  xxxg1117xxx (f) has not yet
been demonstrated. however, due to and reinforcing this
original confusion, some papers were published about the
human  xxxg1117xxx (g) splice variant using the original name  xxxg1117xxx (e)
(e.g. claeysen et al., 1999; mialet et al., 2000a; bozon et al.,
2002; di scala et al., 2004).
2.5. 5-ht5 and  xxxg1119xxx  receptors
so far, the human  xxxg1118xxx  is still considered a
putative receptor, as there is not yet any evidence to confirm that
this receptor is expressed in an endogenous setting (grailhe et
al., 2001). concerning the  xxxg1119xxx , there is no evidence
to support a role for this receptor in the cardiovascular system.
these receptors will therefore not be further described in this
review.
2.6. the 5-ht7 receptor
the 5-ht7 receptor couples positively to gs protein thereby
activating the adenylyl cyclase. the human 5-ht7 receptor
exists in 3 splice variants with different c-termini, 5-ht7(a), 5ht7(b), and 5-ht7(d) (heidmann et al., 1997; jasper et al.,
1997). so far, no pharmacological or functional differences
have been demonstrated between these 3 human splice variants
(krobert et al., 2001; krobert & levy, 2002). also, recombinantly expressed human 5-ht7 receptors behave as if they are
preassociated with g protein in the absence of ligand (bruheim
et al., 2003) and express the unusual property of apparently
stealing signaling capacity from other gs-coupled receptors
(andressen et al., 2006), but the physiological and human
cardiovascular significance of this is as yet unknown. a recent
report, studying cells transfected with the mouse 5-ht7(a)
receptor as well as mouse hippocampal neurons, indicates that
the 5-ht7 receptor may also activate g12, resulting in
transcriptional activation through rho family small gtpases
(kvachnina et al., 2005). in the human cardiovascular system,
mrna for the 5-ht7 receptor has been found in coronary
arteries (bard et al., 1993) and on vascular smooth muscle
where it may mediate relaxation (ullmer et al., 1995), whereas
evidence for human cardiac functions of the 5-ht7 receptor is
lacking (section 4.1.2).
3. cardiac 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors
human cardiac 5-ht receptors are depicted in fig. 2.
functional cardiostimulant  xxxg1117xxx  receptors have been described in right atrium (kaumann et al., 1990), left atrium
(sanders & kaumann, 1992) and in right and left ventricle
(brattelid et al., 2004b). human cardiac  xxxg1117xxx  receptors
mediate arrhythmias (kaumann, 1994; kaumann & sanders,

fig. 2. location of 5-ht receptor subtypes in the human heart. evidence for human sinoatrial  xxxg1117xxx  receptors, pulmonary vein  xxxg1117xxx  receptors and vagal 5-ht3
receptors is indirect but direct functional evidence has been provided in porcine, sheep and rat models, respectively.

1994; pau et al., 2003; brattelid et al., 2004b). activation of 5ht3 receptors, presumably located at epicardial afferent sensory
nerve endings of the vagus, can probably cause reflex
bradycardia (mohr et al., 1987). activation of 5-ht3 receptors,
located at epicardial sympathetic afferent c fibers, could
possibly transmit ischaemic  xxxd1914xxx  pain (fu & longhurst,
2002). activation of 5-ht1b and 5-ht2a receptors of coronary
arteries could elicit vascular constriction and spasm, thereby
indirectly producing life-threatening arrhythmias and cardiodepression (kaumann et al., 1993, 1994). cardiac valvular 5-ht2b
receptors have been identified and appear involved in valvular
cardiopathies caused by 5-ht in carcinoids (møller et al., 2003),
fenfluramine (fitzgerald et al., 2000), ergot derived dopamine
agonists (horvath et al., 2004) and 3,4- xxxd2611xxx  (mdma, ‘ecstacy’) (setola et al., 2003).
3.1. heart rate
intravenously administered 5-ht can both decrease (harris
et al., 1960) and increase (hollander et al., 1957; le mesurier et
al., 1959; parks et al., 1960) heart rate in man.
3.1.1. bradycardia
5-ht-induced bradycardia in man is accompanied by
hypotension (harris et al., 1960) and probably produced
through activation of 5-ht3 receptors located at epicardial
afferent vagal nerve endings. in the cat the intrapericardial
injection of 5-ht elicits reflex bradycardia (i.e. the bezoldjarisch reflex) and hypotension accompanied by inhibition of
efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity (mohr et al., 1987).
these effects are prevented by either vagotomy or greatly
attenuated with the administration of mdl72222 (mohr et al.,
1987), a 5-ht3-selective blocker (fozard, 1984). by releasing

5-ht from platelets through  xxxg2253xxx  simulation
(hamberg et al., 1975), the tromboxane a2 agonist u-46619
also elicits the bezold-jarisch reflex and produces hypotension in the rabbit; the  xxxg1116xxx -selective antagonist
 xxxd3451xxx  prevents these effects, consistent with activation of
epicardial vagal 5-ht3 receptors (wacker et al., 2003).
decreases in heart rate have been observed during arteriographic examinations (eckberg et al., 1974; perez-gomez &
garcia-aguado, 1977) and prinzmetal angina (perez-gomez
et al., 1979) but it is not clear whether a 5-ht-evoked
bezold-jarisch reflex is involved.
3.1.2. tachycardia
5-ht produces dose-dependent tachycardia in healthy
volunteers (le mesurier et al., 1959), plausibly through 5ht4 receptors as argued before (kaumann & sanders, 1998). in
support for a  xxxg1117xxx  nature of human sinoatrial 5-ht receptors is
a double blind randomised study reporting small tachycardia
caused by  xxxd1708xxx  (bateman, 1986).  xxxd1708xxx  is a partial
agonist, with respect to 5-ht, that enhances contractility of
trabeculae isolated from human atria (kaumann et al., 1991).
the tachycardia elicited by 5-ht and  xxxd1708xxx  were mimicked
at  xxxg1117xxx  receptors of the sinoatrial node of newborn piglets
(kaumann, 1990). it is possible that the human sinoatrial
tachycardia evoked by 5-ht is mediated through  xxxd1773xxx 
generated through  xxxg1117xxx  receptors and subsequent activation of
the pacemaker current if. if channels are permeable for both na+
and k+ and activated by hyperpolarisation at membrane
potentials too negative to contribute to the pacemaker action
potential. 5-ht activates the channels by causing a shift to less
negative potentials, thereby hastening diastolic depolarisation
so that tachycardia ensues. although direct proof for this
mechanism is lacking for human sinoatrial cells, evidence for 5-

ht-evoked stimulation of if has been found on human atrial
myocytes (pino et al., 1998; workman & rankin, 1998).
3.2. heart force
3.2.1. atrium
in human atrium, mrna for  xxxg1117xxx (a) (claeysen et al., 1997;
blondel et al., 1998; bach et al., 2001) and  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptors
(van den wyngaert et al., 1997; blondel et al., 1998; bach et al.,
2001), as well as  xxxg1117xxx (g) (mialet et al., 2000a, brattelid et al.,
2004a) and  xxxg1117xxx (i) receptors (brattelid et al., 2004a) were
found with rt-pcr (fig. 1). the corresponding binding affinity
of 5-ht, 5-meot, 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-ct),  xxxd3451xxx , sb203186, sb207710, gr113808,  xxxd3097xxx ,  xxxd1708xxx ,
gr125487 and  xxxd3039xxx  for recombinant  xxxg1117xxx (a),  xxxg1117xxx (b),
 xxxg1117xxx (g) and  xxxg1117xxx (i) receptors was not different for these
4 splice variants (brattelid et al., 2004a; krobert et al., 2005).
furthermore, the binding affinities of several of these ligands
for recombinant  xxxg1117xxx (a) and  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptors correlated
closely (bach et al., 2001) with both binding affinities obtained
for  xxxg1117xxx  receptors of human atrium (kaumann et al., 1996)
and affinity estimates obtained from the blockade of human
atrial  xxxg1117xxx  receptors by antagonists or partial agonists
(kaumann & sanders, 1998; krobert et al., 2005). it would
appear therefore uncertain which  xxxg1117xxx  receptor splice variants
contribute mainly to the effects of 5-ht and related ligands in
human atrium. however, recent work has revealed subtle
coupling differences of some splice variants (pindon et al.,
2002; castro et al., 2005) which will be discussed in section
5.2.2.1.
human atrial  xxxg1117xxx  receptors, identified in 1989 (kaumann
et al., 1989a), mediate positive inotropic and lusitropic effects of
5-ht,  xxxd1773xxx  elevation and activation of cyclic ampdependent protein kinase (pka) in right (kaumann et al., 1990)
and left (sanders & kaumann, 1992) atrium. the partial
agonists  xxxd3097xxx  and  xxxd1708xxx  also cause positive inotropic
effects through the  xxxd1773xxx /pka pathway (kaumann et al.,
1991). the pka activation through human atrial  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors suggested phosphorylation of l-type ca2+ channels
(kaumann et al., 1990, 1991) which was verified by ouadid et
al. (1992) and jahnel et al. (1993). the hastened relaxation (i.e.
lusitropic effects) observed with 5-ht through atrial  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors probably occurs through pka-dependent phosphorylation of phospholamban, thereby removing the inhibitory
effect of non-phosphorylated phospholamban on the ca2+atpase (serca), thus augmenting its pumping activity.
cytoplasmic ca2+ is then reduced and contractile proteins
relax, and more ca2+ becomes available in the sarcoplasmic
reticulum for release. troponin i may also be phosphorylated by
pka thereby reducing the sensitivity of troponin for ca2+ and
contributing to relaxation.
5-ht causes an up to 6-fold increase in l-type ca2+ channel
current through  xxxg1117xxx  receptors, with an obligatory involvement of pka, in atrial myocytes from patients in sinus rhythm
(ouadid et al., 1992) but 5-ht-evoked increases in l-type ca2+
current are smaller in atrial myocytes from failing hearts
(ouadid et al., 1995). the increased l-type ca2+ current may

cause myocyte ca2+ overload, thereby facilitating the appearance of arrhythmias (kaumann, 1994). 5-ht also enhances the
hyperpolarisation-activated pacemaker current if through  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors in human atrium (pino et al., 1998; lonardo et al.,
2005), which would be expected to facilitate spontaneous
impulse formation or ectopic activity. experimental arrhythmias
have been reported with 5-ht in human atrium; the arrhythmias
are suppressed by blockade of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors and therefore
mediated through  xxxg1117xxx  receptors (kaumann & sanders,
1994). the incidence of 5-ht-evoked arrhythmias is inversely
related to the rate at which atrial trabeculae are paced (kaumann
& sanders, 1994). 5-ht can also elicit arrhythmic contractions
(sanders et al., 1995) and pro-arrhythmic electrophysiological
events (delayed after depolarisations) (pau et al., 2003) in
human atrial myocytes. increases in l-type ca2+ current (pau et
al., 2005a), associated with positive inotropic effects (krobert et
al., 2005), have also been observed with the partial  xxxg1117xxx 
receptor agonist  xxxd3039xxx , a gastrokinetic agent (prins et al.,
2000). however,  xxxd3039xxx  did neither elicit arrhythmic
contractions (krobert et al., 2005) nor produce pro-electrophysiological changes (pau et al., 2005a), presumably because
the increase of l-type ca2+ current was smaller than the
increase caused by 5-ht (pau et al., 2005a). small increases of
l-type ca2+ current, compared to 5-ht, have also been
observed with the partial agonist ml10302 (blondel et al.,
1997) on human atrial myocytes.
the inotropic and camp-elevating effects of 5-ht (sanders
et al., 1995), as well as the arrhythmic inotropic (kaumann &
sanders, 1994) and electrophysiological (pau et al., 2003)
effects of 5-ht, are enhanced in atrial trabeculae and myocytes
obtained from patients chronically treated with beta-blockers. beta2adrenoceptors (kaumann et al., 1989b; hall et al., 1990) and
h2 histamine receptors (sanders et al., 1996), both coupled to
gs protein, also mediate enhanced inotropic and arrhythmic
responses (kaumann & sanders, 1993; sanders et al., 1996) in
atrial trabeculae obtained from patients chronically treated with
beta-blockers selective for  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors. one possible
mechanism for the greater human atrial inotropic and
arrhythmic responsiveness through  xxxg1117xxx  receptors, beta2-adrenoceptors and h2 receptors in  xxxg836xxx -selective blocker-treated
patients could be related to their promiscuous coupling to gi
protein (kilts et al., 2000). recombinant  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptors, but
not  xxxg1117xxx (a) receptors, have been found not only to couple to
galphas protein but also to galphai/o proteins (pindon et al., 2002).
consistent with dual coupling to galphas and galphai/o proteins, castro
et al. (2005) reported that 5-ht causes a greater increase in ltype ca2+ current in rat myocytes transfected with human 5ht4(b) receptors in the presence of pertussis toxin (ptx, that
inactivates gi/o protein) than in the absence of ptx, suggesting
that this receptor isoform can couple to both gs and gi/o
proteins. in contrast, ptx-treatment did not modify the effects
of 5-ht through transfected  xxxg1117xxx (d) receptors, suggesting that
this isoform only couples to gs but not gi/o proteins (castro et
al., 2005). gi protein has been proposed to have a protective role
against beta-adrenoceptor-mediated arrhythmias because treatment of rats with ptx induces  xxxd2398xxx  to consistently elicit
automaticity in rat ventricular preparations (grimm et al.,

a.j. kaumann, f.o. levy / pharmacology & therapeutics 111 (2006) 674–706

1998). it is well known that in human heart failure gi proteins
are increased (neumann et al., 1988; feldman et al., 1988).
chronic beta-adrenoceptor blockade with metoprolol in patients
with heart failure is known to decrease ptx-sensitive galphai
protein activity (sigmund et al., 1996), thereby probably
reducing the gi-evoked inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, thus
allowing greater camp/pka signals, including inotropic
cardiostimulation and arrhythmias. the enhanced camp signal,
increased inotropic responses and arrhythmias caused by 5-ht
through  xxxg1117xxx  receptors in human atrial trabeculae (kaumann
& sanders, 1994; sanders et al., 1995) and myocytes (sanders
et al., 1995; pau et al., 2003) obtained from patients treated
chronically with beta-blockers, are consistent with this interpretation. however, more experimental evidence is required to
support or reject this hypothesis.
recombinant  xxxg1117xxx (d) and  xxxg1117xxx (g) receptors can form
constitutive homodimers and  xxxg1117xxx (d) receptors heterodimers
with recombinant beta2-adrenoceptors that are not affected by
ligands with agonist or antagonist properties (berthouze et al.,
2005). formation of heterodimers could plausibly be related to
the atrial hyperresponsiveness through beta2-adrenoceptors (kaumann et al., 1989b; hall et al., 1990) and  xxxg1117xxx  receptors
(sanders et al., 1995) of patients chronically treated with betablockers. however,  xxxg1117xxx (d) receptors appear to be expressed in
gut but not heart (mialet et al., 2000b) and dimerisation of other
splice variants, expressed in human heart (fig. 1), remains to be
demonstrated.

adrenoceptors) in right ventricular trabeculae. 5-ht caused
consistent positive inotropic effects (46% vs.  xxxd2398xxx ) and
also lusitropic effects (25% vs.  xxxd2398xxx ) in left ventricular
trabeculae. in 3 of 11 patients 5-ht elicited arrhythmic
ventricular contractions. 5-ht even produced small increases
in contractility of left ventricular trabeculae, on occasion, in the
absence of  xxxd2388xxx . all 5-ht effects were prevented or
antagonised by gr113808, consistent with mediation through
 xxxg1117xxx  receptors (brattelid et al., 2004b).
as demonstrated in human ventricle, 5-ht also caused
positive inotropic effects in ventricular trabeculae of new-born
piglets (16% vs.  xxxd2398xxx ) and adult pigs (32% vs.
 xxxd2398xxx ) in the presence of  xxxd2388xxx . the effects of 5-ht
were antagonised competitively by either sb207710 or
gr113808, consistent with mediation through  xxxg1117xxx  receptors
(brattelid et al., 2004b). 5-ht, in the presence of  xxxd2388xxx ,
increased pka activity by 20% and 39% compared to
 xxxd2398xxx  in ventricle from new-born or adult pigs respectively, consistent with the greater inotropic effects in adults. the
5-ht-evoked pka signal was prevented by sb207710,
consistent with mediation through  xxxg1117xxx  receptors (brattelid
et al., 2004b). these results support the use of porcine ventricle
as an experimental model for human ventricular  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors.
4. vascular 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors
4.1. human arteries

3.2.2. ventricle
mrna for  xxxg1117xxx (a),  xxxg1117xxx (b),  xxxg1117xxx (g) and  xxxg1117xxx (i)
receptors has been detected with rt-pcr in human ventricle
(bach et al., 2001; brattelid et al., 2004a, 2004b). however,
demonstration of a functional role for human ventricular  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors has proved elusive until recently. early reports
claimed that, unlike human atrium, 5-ht does not increase
contractile force in human ventricular preparations (jahnel et
al., 1992; schoemaker et al., 1993). similar to the situation in
man, 5-ht exerts positive chronotropic and inotropic effects
(kaumann, 1990; parker et al., 1995) through porcine atrial 5ht4 receptors but apparently not through porcine ventricular 5ht4 receptors (lorrain et al., 1992; saxena et al., 1992;
schoemaker et al., 1992). human atrial  xxxg1117xxx  receptors are
expressed at a density considerably lower than the density of
 xxxg836xxx - and beta2-adrenoceptors (kaumann et al., 1996) and mediate
camp signals that are smaller than those of beta-adrenoceptor
stimulation (kaumann et al., 1990, 1991; sanders & kaumann,
1992; sanders et al., 1995). conceivably the density of  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors in human ventricle is even lower than in human atrium
and camp hydrolysis by phosphodiesterases (pde) may
prevent the release of sufficient catalytic units of pka
necessary for the phosphorylation of proteins involved in
cardiostimulation. accordingly, functional  xxxg1117xxx  receptors
were uncovered in human and porcine ventricular trabeculae
in the presence of the non-selective pde inhibitor isobutylmethyl-xanthine ( xxxd2388xxx ; brattelid et al., 2004b). 5-ht usually,
but not always, caused small increases of contractile force (8%
of the maximum effect of  xxxd2398xxx  mediated through beta-

5-ht receptor subtypes mediating vasoconstriction were
identified with the help of subtype-selective antagonists and by
comparison with the pharmacology of recombinant receptors.
messenger rna for both 5-ht1b and 5-ht2a receptors has
been detected in smooth muscle cells of human aorta and
pulmonary artery (ullmer et al., 1995). useful antagonists as
tools have been the 5-ht2a-selective  xxxd2419xxx  (van nueten et
al., 1981), 5-ht1b-selective sb224289 (roberts et al., 1997)
and  xxxg1110xxx -selective brl15572 (price et al., 1997).
following the proposal that human arterial vasoconstriction
by 5-ht is mediated by coexisting 5-ht1b and 5-ht2a
receptors (kaumann et al., 1993), evidence for this has been
accumulating for coronary artery (kaumann et al., 1993, 1994),
pulmonary artery (morecroft et al., 1999), temporal artery
(verheggen et al., 1996, 1998) and occipital artery (verheggen
et al., 2004). it is likely that 5-ht-induced contractions of
human mesenteric artery (kaumann et al., 1993), internal
mammary artery (yildiz et al., 1996a), umbilical artery (lovren
et al., 1999), omental artery (wallerstedt et al., 1996) and
uterine artery (karlsson et al., 1997) are also mediated through
both 5-ht1b and 5-ht2a receptors. however, intracranial
arteries appear to contract exclusively through 5-ht1b receptors
(hamel & bouchard, 1991; hamel et al., 1993).
4.1.1.1. coronary arteries. human coronary artery can both
constrict and relax in response to intracoronary 5-ht but the
dilator response disappears in patients with stable coronary

artery disease (golino et al., 1991; mcfadden et al., 1991). the
selective blocker of 5-ht2a receptors  xxxd2419xxx  was used both
clinically and as a pharmacological tool. the constrictor
response evoked by 5-ht is mediated through ketanserinsensitive and  xxxd2419xxx -insensitive 5-ht receptors (godfraind
et al., 1992; mcfadden et al., 1992).
analysis of the antagonism of 5-ht-induced contractions of
endothelium-denuded epicardial coronary arteries from 28
patients with terminal heart failure by  xxxd2419xxx  (100–1000
nm) yielded patient-dependent results (kaumann et al., 1994).
 xxxd2419xxx  shifted concentration–effect curves to 5-ht to a
variable extent and reduced the maximum effect (emax) of 5-ht
on average by 29% (range 0–89%), consistent with mediation
through 5-ht2a receptors. the  xxxd2419xxx -resistant component
of the 5-ht curves was shifted 2 log units by methiothepin (100
nm), an antagonist with similar affinity for 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx 
receptors. the affinity of  xxxd2419xxx  for recombinant  xxxg1110xxx 
and 5-ht1b receptors was studied simultaneously and found to
be ∼ 100-fold higher for  xxxg1110xxx -receptors (pki = 7.1). it was
therefore proposed that the 5-ht receptors resistant to
 xxxd2419xxx  but sensitive to methiothepin were 5-ht1b receptors
(kaumann et al., 1994). in line with this conclusion,
immunoreactivity for 5-ht1b receptors, but not for  xxxg1110xxx 
receptors, was found within the smooth muscle wall of human
coronary arteries (nilsson et al., 1999a). consistent with the cofunction of both 5-ht 2a and 5-ht 1b receptors, their
corresponding mrna was also detected (ishida et al., 1999;
bouchelet et al., 2000; van den broek et al., 2002).
the  xxxd3263xxx  sumatriptan causes contractions of variable
strength of human isolated coronary arteries in a patientdependent manner (kaumann et al., 1994; maassenvandenbrink et al., 1996).  xxxd2419xxx  failed to antagonise sumatriptaninduced contractions (connor et al., 1989; chester et al., 1990;
kaumann et al., 1994) but the contractions are blocked by the 5ht1b/1d receptor antagonists methiothepin (chester et al.,
1990; kaumann et al., 1994) and gr55562 (maassenvandenbrink et al., 2000). because 5-ht1b receptors but not  xxxg1110xxx 
receptors have been detected in the smooth muscle of human
coronary (nilsson et al., 1999a) and because 5-ht appears to
contract in part or mostly through 5-ht1b receptors (kaumann
et al., 1994), it appears likely that sumatriptan-evoked
contractions are mediated through 5-ht1b receptors, but direct
evidence with 5-ht1b-selective blockers is not yet available.
comparison of the  xxxg1109xxx -mediated emax of 5-ht
with the emax of sumatriptan on a coronary artery from the same
patient suggests that sumatriptan is a full agonist, compared to
5-ht, through 5-ht1b receptors (kaumann et al., 1993, 1994).
the contractions of isolated human coronary arteries by the
triptans naratriptan,  xxxd3562xxx ,  xxxd3135xxx , avitriptan (maassenvandenbrink et al., 1998a),  xxxd1976xxx  (van den broek et al.,
2000), frovatriptan (parsons et al., 1998), and almotriptan (bou
et al., 2001) are probably also mediated through 5-ht1b
receptors, but verification, that is whether the effects are
blocked by a 5-ht1b-selective antagonist, is still missing.
4.1.1.2. pulmonary arteries. 5-ht, infused through a catheter
just beyond the pulmonary valve, can cause unequivocal rises in

pulmonary pressure (harris et al., 1960). 5-ht causes
contractile responses of spirally cut preparations of the human
pulmonary artery (houghton & phillips, 1973). sumatriptan
causes pressor responses in the human pulmonary circulation
(mcintyre et al., 1992) and constricts rings of the large human
pulmonary artery (maclean et al., 1996; cortijo et al., 1997),
suggesting an involvement of 5-ht1b or  xxxg1110xxx  receptors. the
5-ht-evoked constriction is partially antagonised by the 5ht2a-selective antagonist ritanserin and the 5-ht1b/1d blocker
gr127935 (cortijo et al., 1997), consistent with an involvement of 5-ht2a receptors and 5-ht1b and/or  xxxg1110xxx  receptors.
binding sites for [3h]5-ct were also detected in human
pulmonary artery, consistent with the existence of 5-ht1b and/
or  xxxg1110xxx  receptors (cortijo et al., 1997). 5-ht-induced
contractions of human small (250–300 mum i.d.) muscular
pulmonary arteries are mediated through 5-ht1b receptors at
low 5-ht concentrations (≤30 nm) and through 5-ht2a
receptors at higher 5-ht concentrations, and mrna for both 5ht2a and 5-ht1b receptors is expressed (morecroft et al.,
1999). sumatriptan was a full agonist with respect to 5-ht, the
effects were blocked by 5-ht1b-selective sb224289 but not by
 xxxg1110xxx -selective brl15572 (morecroft et al., 1999).
4.1.1.3. internal mammary arteries. 5-ht-induced contractions of the human internal mammary artery are partially
blocked by  xxxd2419xxx , consistent with mediation through 5ht2a receptors (conti et al., 1990; godfraind et al., 1992;
yildiz et al., 1996a). the nature of the  xxxd2419xxx -resistant
component of 5-ht-induced contractions is unknown but could
be 5-ht1b because sumatriptan causes small contractions in
70% of the arteries studied (yildiz et al., 1996a). the
sumatriptan-evoked contractions become more consistent and
pronounced in arteries whose basal tone had been slightly
enhanced by either elevated k+ or angiotensin (yildiz et al.,
1996b).
4.1.1.4. mesenteric arteries.  xxxd2419xxx  antagonises partially
5-ht-induced contractions of the human mesenteric artery,
reducing the maximum response by 41%, consistent with
mediation through 5-ht2a receptors. the  xxxd2419xxx -resistant
component was antagonised by methiothepin and presumably
mediated through 5-ht1b receptors (kaumann et al., 1993).
similarly, 5-ht-induced contractions were partially antagonised by either  xxxd2419xxx  or the 5-ht1b/ xxxg1110xxx  antagonist
gr127935 (gul et al., 2003). in addition, sumatriptan contracts
the mesenteric artery through  xxxd2419xxx -resistant but
gr127935-sensitive receptors (gul et al., 2003). the suspected
5-ht1b nature of these receptors should still be verified with a
5-ht1b-selective antagonist.
4.1.1.5. omental arteries. the contractile effects of 5-ht,
sumatriptan and other agonists were studied on omental arteries,
obtained from patients undergoing abdominal surgery (wallerstedt et al., 1996). with the help of  xxxd2419xxx  and methiothepin
wallerstedt et al. (1996) concluded that the effects of 5-ht are
mediated through both 5-ht1- and 5-ht2a-receptors and the
effects of sumatriptan through 5-ht1 receptors. the likelihood

a.j. kaumann, f.o. levy / pharmacology & therapeutics 111 (2006) 674–706

that 5-ht1 receptors are 5-ht1b receptors needs to be verified
with the use of a 5-ht1b-selective antagonist.
4.1.1.6. umbilical arteries. the human umbilical artery
contracts with 5-ht through both 5-ht1-like and 5-ht2
receptors (maclennan et al., 1989). more recently mrna for
both 5-ht1b and 5-ht2a receptors but not for  xxxg1110xxx  receptors
has been detected in human umbilical artery (lovren et al.,
1999).  xxxd2419xxx  and the 5-ht1b/d antagonist gr127935 both
antagonised partially 5-ht-induced contractions, consistent
with mediation through both 5-ht2a and 5-ht1b receptors
(lovren et al., 1999). sumatriptan caused inconsistent small
contractions. however, marked contractions to sumatriptan,
resistant to  xxxd2419xxx , were observed by precontracting the
vessels with other vasoactive agents, consistent with mediation
through 5-ht1b receptors (lovren et al., 1999). the 5-ht1b
nature of these receptors needs to be verified with the use of a 5ht1b-selective antagonist.
4.1.1.7. uterine arteries. early work, obtained from uterine
preparations devoid of endothelium, reported that 5-ht-induced
contractions were antagonised by  xxxd2419xxx  and spiperone and
therefore mediated through 5-ht2a receptors (fontes ribeiro et
al., 1991). later, karlsson et al. (1997) found that the 5-htinduced contractions were antagonised more by methiothepin
than by  xxxd2419xxx  and that sumatriptan evoked modest
contractions. therefore, both 5-ht1-like and 5-ht2a receptors
function in the human uterine artery. whether the 5-ht1-like
receptors are of 5-ht1b nature still must await experimental
verification with a 5-ht1b-selective antagonist.
4.1.1.8. extracranial arteries. both human temporal arteries
(verheggen et al., 1996, 1998) and occipital arteries (verheggen
et al., 2004) contract with 5-ht through both 5-ht2a and 5ht1b receptors. 5-ht-induced contractions were partially
antagonised by 5-ht2a-selective  xxxd2419xxx  and 5-ht1bselective sb224289 and 5-ht-induced contractions resistant
to one antagonist were blocked by the other. the 5-ht1dselective antagonist brl15772 did not affect 5-ht-induced
contractions. sumatriptan also contracted both temporal
(verheggen et al., 1998) and occipital arteries (verheggen et
al., 2004) through 5-ht1b receptors, sensitive to antagonism by
sb224289 but not to  xxxd2419xxx  and brl15572. these findings
agree with the detection of mrna for 5-ht1b (verheggen et al.,
1998, 2004) and 5-ht2a receptors (verheggen et al., 2004) in
both human temporal and occipital arteries. mrna for  xxxg1110xxx 
receptors was also detected in both temporal and occipital
arteries but is probably located in nerve endings and unrelated to
5-ht-induced contractions (verheggen et al., 1998, 2004).
4.1.1.9. intracranial arteries. hamel et al. (1993) found 5ht1b mrna transcripts in human cerebral arteries and
suggested that 5-ht1b receptors mediate the constrictor effects
of sumatriptan on human basilar artery observed by parsons et
al. (1989). the mediation through 5-ht1b receptors of the
contractile effects of 5-ht and sumatriptan, as well as other
triptans, on cerebral arteries has since been confirmed by several

683

authors (nilsson et al., 1999b; razzaque et al., 1999; van den
broek et al., 2002).  xxxg1109xxx  immunoreactivity was
present in smooth muscle of human cerebral arteries (nilsson et
al., 1999b; razzaque et al., 2002). a participation of  xxxg1110xxx 
and  xxxg1112xxx  receptors in the contractile effects of 5-ht and
sumatriptan on human cerebral arteries was excluded by several
authors (razzaque et al., 1999; bouchelet et al., 2000). the
mediation of the contractile effects of 5-ht and sumatriptan
through 5-ht1b receptors but not  xxxg1110xxx  receptors has been
confirmed with antagonism by the 5-ht1b-selective antagonist
sb224289 and lack of antagonism by the  xxxg1110xxx -selective
brl15572 (van den broek et al., 2002).
4.1.2. vasorelaxation
based on the cellular localisation of mrna for 5-ht
receptors, ullmer et al. (1995) suggested that endothelial 5ht1b, 5-ht2b and perhaps  xxxg1117xxx  receptors and smooth muscle
5-ht7 receptors could be involved in human vascular
relaxation. although several of these receptors mediate
relaxation in arteries of a variety of species (for literature see
elhusseiny & hamel, 2001), direct evidence from human blood
vessels is scarce. for example, although 5-ct and 5-ht
produce increases in  xxxd1773xxx  levels through 5-ht7
receptors of smooth muscle cells, isolated from human uterine
artery (schoeffter et al., 1996), relaxation of this artery through
5-ht7 receptors appears not to have been demonstrated. 5-ht
causes ca2+ release from ryanodine channels through 5-ht2b
receptors in human pulmonary endothelial cells (ullmer et al.,
1996), which would be expected to activate no synthase and
release no, which in turn would relax smooth muscle.
consistent with these events, porcine pulmonary artery relaxes
via 5-ht2b receptors (glusa & pertz, 2000), but evidence for
relaxation of human pulmonary artery through  xxxg1114xxx 
receptors is missing.
4.1.2.1. cerebral arterioles. 5-ht1b mrna was detected in
cerebral microvessels (riad et al., 1998; cohen et al., 1999),
consistent with relaxation of perfused human intracortical
arterioles (47 mum average intraluminal diameter) by nanomolar
sumatriptan concentrations, although contractions were also
observed at higher sumatriptan concentrations (≥ 10− 7 m)
(elhusseiny & hamel, 2001). both the  xxxg1110xxx -selective agonist
pnu109291 and the  xxxg1112xxx -selective agonist ly344864 failed
to elicit relaxant or contractile effects of sumatriptan, despite the
detection of mrna for  xxxg1110xxx  and  xxxg1112xxx  receptors in
isolated microvessels (cohen et al., 1999). the relaxant effects
of sumatriptan were prevented by nomega-nitro-l-arginine (l-nna)
which greatly enhanced sumatriptan-evoked contractions.
these results are consistent with the concept that sumatriptan
caused  xxxd2738xxx  (no)-mediated relaxation through endothelial 5-ht1b receptors and contraction through smooth muscle 5ht1b receptors (elhusseiny & hamel, 2001). interestingly, low
5-ht concentrations (nanomolar) did not produce microvascular relaxation but induced instead small contractions which
became considerably greater at ≥ 10− 7 m. the absence of
microvascular relaxation by 5-ht reported by elhusseiny and
hamel (2001) could be due to a greater relaxant efficacy of

684

a.j. kaumann, f.o. levy / pharmacology & therapeutics 111 (2006) 674–706

sumatriptan than of 5-ht as agonists on endothelial 5-ht1b
receptors. these authors also reported that the sumatriptanevoked relaxation was inversely related to vessel size. as the
blood vessel gets larger, the increase in muscle layers pushes the
equilibrium towards agonist-evoked contractions, mediated
through smooth muscle 5-ht1b receptors (riad et al., 1998;
elhusseiny & hamel, 2001).
4.1.2.2. umbilical arteries. perfused umbilical arteries,
prepared from uncomplicated full term pregnancies, relax
with low (nanomolar) 5-ht concentrations and contract with
higher (≥ 10− 7 m) concentrations (haugen et al., 1997). the
relaxant component of 5-ht was only marginally reduced by
nomega-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-name) or  xxxd2610xxx .
 xxxd2621xxx  (100 nm) prevented 5-ht-induced relaxations
and contractions. because it is unlikely that endotheliumderived no was involved, the participation of endothelial 5ht1b and 5-ht2b receptors (ullmer et al., 1995) was also
unlikely. instead,  xxxd2621xxx  may have antagonised smooth
muscle 5-ht7 receptors. the affinity of  xxxd2621xxx  is
sufficiently high for 5-ht7 receptors (pki ≈ 7.6–7.8, krobert
et al., 2001), so that at least 80% of the 5-ht7 receptors would
be blocked with 100 nm  xxxd2621xxx , the concentrations used
by haugen et al. (1997). the hypothetical mediation through 5ht7 receptors needs to be verified with the use of an antagonist
selective for 5-ht7 receptors.
4.1.2.3. coronary arteries. although 5-ht7 receptor mrna
has been detected in human coronary arteries (bard et al., 1993),
functional evidence has eluded detection, so far. unlike other
triptans, the 5-ht1b/d agonist flovatriptan causes markedly
biphasic effects at human endothelium-denuded coronary
arteries, contractions at low concentrations and relaxations at
high concentrations (parsons et al., 1998; comer, 2002). this
pattern may be related to agonistic effects of flovatriptan at 5ht7 receptors. flovatriptan stimulated adenylyl cyclase of
recombinant 5-ht7 receptors as a full agonist with submicromolar potency, while sumatriptan and naratriptan were only
partial agonists with supramicromolar potency (comer, 2002).
bell-shaped concentration–effect curves for 5-ht have also
been observed in coronary arteries of some patients but not in
others (kaumann et al., 1994). more work is needed to assess
whether 5-ht7 receptors participate in relaxation at high agonist
concentrations.
4.1.2.4. occipital arteries. bell-shaped concentration–effect
curves for 5-ht were observed on occipital arteries, obtained
from patients undergoing brain surgery (verheggen et al., 2004).
the relaxations elicited by high 5-ht concentrations were
partially reduced by l-name suggesting release of no from
endothelial cells.  xxxd2419xxx  also prevented part of the 5-htinduced relaxation. however, selective antagonists of 5-ht1b,
 xxxg1110xxx , 5-ht2b,  xxxg1117xxx  and 5-ht7 receptors failed to affect the
5-ht-induced relaxations, so that their nature remains unknown.
4.1.2.5. renal arteries. evidence for endothelium-dependent
dilation of the perfused renal arterial bed of the rat by 5-ht, 5-

ct and 8-oh-dpat in the presence of ritanserin (to block 5ht2a receptors) and  xxxd3451xxx  (to block 5-ht3 receptors) has
been provided by verbeuren et al. (1991). they showed that the
agonist-mediated dilation was suppressed by the 5-ht1a
receptor-selective antagonist bmy7378 (sharp et al., 1990)
and decreased by inhibitors of the action of  xxxd2738xxx 
(haemoglobin,  xxxd2610xxx  and l-nna). they concluded
that dilatory effects of the agonists were mediated by 5-ht1a
receptors. however, ullmer et al. (1995) failed to detect 5-ht1a
mrna in the rat renal artery. 5-ht1a receptors have been
detected with immunohistochemistry in the human kidney
tubules but not in blood vessels (raymond et al., 1993).
nevertheless, it may be worthwhile to investigate whether 5-ht
can dilate some arteries of human kidney and whether this
occurs through 5-ht1a receptors.
4.2. veins
4.2.1. pulmonary veins
although sheep pulmonary veins appear to relax with 5-ht
via 5-ht 4 receptors (cocks & arnold, 1992), human
pulmonary veins contract with 5-ht (houghton & phillips,
1973). as in human pulmonary arteries, both 5-ht1b and 5ht2a receptors appear to mediate 5-ht-induced contractions of
human pulmonary veins (cortijo et al., 1997).
4.2.2. hand veins
5-ht, sumatriptan and other agonists produced contractions
in isolated segments of human superficial hand veins (bodelsson et al., 1992). the contractile effects of the 5-ht2aselective agonist alpha-methyl-5-ht were antagonised by  xxxd2419xxx , consistent with mediation through 5-ht2a receptors. the
sumatriptan-evoked contractions were resistant to blockade by
 xxxd2419xxx  but antagonised by methiothepin, consistent with
mediation through 5-ht1-like receptors, possibly 5-ht1b
receptors, but this needs verification with a 5-ht1b-selective
antagonist.
4.2.3. saphenous veins
early evidence suggested the co-function of 5-ht1 and 5ht2 receptors in human saphenous vein because  xxxd2419xxx 
blocked the effects of high but not low 5-ht concentrations
(docherty & hyland, 1986). these receptors have more
recently been demonstrated to be 5-ht1b and 5-ht2a receptors.
bax et al. (1992) confirmed that  xxxd2419xxx  antagonised the
contractile effects of high but not low 5-ht concentrations, and
in addition failed to antagonise sumatriptan-evoked contractions. 5-ht1b immunoreactivity was detected in smooth muscle
of human saphenous vein (razzaque et al., 2002) and the
contractile effects of sumatriptan were antagonised by 5-ht1bselective sb224289 but hardly by  xxxg1110xxx -selective brl15572
(van den broek et al., 2002).
4.2.4. umibilical veins
5-ht is a potent constrictor of human umbilical veins (altura
et al., 1972). the 5-ht-induced contractions are in part
antagonised by  xxxd2419xxx , and high-affinity binding sites for

a.j. kaumann, f.o. levy / pharmacology & therapeutics 111 (2006) 674–706

685

 xxxd2419xxx  (kd = 0.3 nm) have been reported, consistent with
mediation through 5-ht2a receptors (rogines-velo et al.,
2002a). when basal venous tone is slightly enhanced by kcl,
sumatriptan also elicited contractions that were antagonised by
the 5-ht1b/d blocker gr55562 in rings of human umbilical
veins (rogines-velo et al., 2002b), attributed to mediation
through 5-ht1b receptors. this interpretation demands verification with the use of a selective 5-ht1b antagonist.

agonists tested, including buspirone,  xxxd2498xxx  and (+)8-ohdpat, exhibited efficacies similar to the wild-type receptor.
this and other peculiarities of this mutant receptor suggest a
role for transmembrane 1 of the  xxxg1108xxx  in mediating 5ht response. however, since there is no data indicating a role
for the  xxxg1108xxx  in the human cardiovascular system, it
is premature to speculate about cardiovascular effects of
polymorphic variants of this receptor.

5. 5-hydroxytryptamine
receptors and cardiovascular disease

5.1.1.2. polymorphisms of the  xxxg1109xxx . a number of
 xxxg1109xxx  polymorphisms have been identified, both in
the coding sequence and in the surrounding 5′-utr and 3′utr (sanders et al., 2002).
f124c-5-ht1b. a naturally occurring variant of the 5-ht1b
receptor was identified by nöthen et al. (1994), in which 124phenylalanine is substituted by cysteine. the incidence of the
124c variant was 2% in the caucasian population. comparison
of the binding affinity for [3h]5-ct at recombinant receptors,
transiently transfected into cos-7 cells at pmol mg protein− 1
densities, yielded kd values of 8.8 nm for the f124 5-ht1b
receptor and 2.3 nm for the 124c variant (brüss et al., 1999).
consistent with this finding, the affinity of 5-ht and several
ligands, including sumatriptan,  xxxd2621xxx  and dihydroergotamine, was also 2- to 3-fold higher for the 124c variant than
for f124. however, the affinity of  xxxd2419xxx  was 2.4-fold lower
at 124c than f124. brüss et al. (1999) suggested that the rarely
observed sumatriptan-induced spasm of coronary arteries could
be related to patients carrying the 124c polymorphism, thereby
enhancing the constrictor potency of sumatriptan in these
arteries (kaumann et al., 1994).
in transfected rat c-6 glioma cells, stably expressing
1.0 pmol mg protein− 1 f124 variant or 0.6 pmol mg
protein− 1 124c variant, kiel et al. (2000) found a 1.6-fold
higher binding affinity of [3h]5-ct at 124c. kiel et al. (2000)
also reported 2.6- to 3.8-fold greater potencies of 5-ct, 5-ht
and sumatriptan as stimulants of [35s]gtpgammas binding at 124c
compared to f124, but lower maximum binding. the 5-ht1bselective antagonist sb224289 decreased [35s]gtpgammas binding
at both variants in the absence of agonists, but blocked
surmountably with a 2-fold higher affinity the effects of 5-ct
at 124c compared to f124. both 5-ct and sumatriptan were
around 2-fold more potent as inhibitors of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated
adenylyl cyclase activity at 124c than f124 but the
corresponding intrinsic activities did not differ.
the work of brüss et al. (1999) and kiel et al. (2000) with
recombinant f124c variants would suggest a greater arterial
constrictor potency of 5-ht and sumatriptan on 124c than f124
5-ht1b receptors. analysing data from temporal arteries of 98
patients, verheggen et al. (submitted for publication) did not
detect an enhanced constrictor potency of the three heterozygous 124c patients compared to the 95 homozygous f124
patients. however, verheggen et al. (2006) found that in the 3
patients with the 124c variant the 5-ht responses were mostly
mediated through 5-ht1b receptors while in the 95 patients
with f124 the mediation of the 5-ht-induced contractions is
more evenly shared by both coexisting 5-ht1b and 5-ht2a
receptors. verheggen et al. (submitted for publication) have

5.1. genetic mutations and
polymorphisms in 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors
possibly relevant to the human cardiovascular system
several polymorphic variants of human serotonin receptor
genes have been reported. polymorphisms located in the
untranslated regions (utr) may give rise to altered levels of
receptor expression, through altered levels of transcription (e.g.
polymorphisms in the promoter region) or through altered
mrna stability (e.g. polymorphisms in the 3′-utr). polymorphisms (usually single nucleotide polymorphisms or snps)
located in the open reading frame (coding region) may be silent,
either by causing no amino acid change (synonymous
polymorphisms) or by causing an amino acid change without
functional (physiological or pharmacological) consequences.
such mutations will not be discussed in detail here. other
polymorphisms cause an amino acid change (non-synonymous
polymorphisms) with functional (physiological or pharmacological) consequences. such polymorphisms with documented
or putative cardiovascular consequences will be the main topic
of this section. importantly, although not dealt with in detail
here, silent polymorphisms may also be associated with disease
in genetic linkage studies. this would normally indicate that the
polymorphic protein (e.g. the 5-ht receptor) is in linkage
disequilibrium with another polymorphism, which may be
causally related to the disease.
when describing coding region snps in serotonin receptors,
we will use a nomenclature like “a50v-5-ht1a”, where the
number indicates the position of the polymorphic amino acid
residue, and the first and last 1-letter amino acid code indicates
the more and less frequent polymorphic variant, respectively.
the 2 alternative alleles would then typically be referred to as
a50 and 50v. we will adhere to this nomenclature even in cases
where there may be doubt about which allele is more frequent.
5.1.1. polymorphisms in 5-ht1 receptors
5.1.1.1. polymorphisms of 5-ht1a receptors. of 13 potential
snps resulting in amino acid changes that were identified in the
human  xxxg1108xxx , only 2, a50v-5-ht1a and l381f- xxxg1108xxx , resulted in altered pharmacology (del tredici et al.,
2004). from a pharmacological point of view, the a50v- xxxg1108xxx  is interesting. for example, the a50v amino acid
substitution in transmembrane domain 1 resulted in a selective
loss of detectable response to 5-ht and 5-ct, whereas other

686

interpreted their results by the finding that the 124c 5-ht1b
receptor couples less tightly to gi protein than the f124 5-ht1b
receptor (kiel et al., 2000). it has been shown that gi-coupled
receptors can synergise with gq-coupled receptors through
donation of betagamma unit, thereby activating phospholipase cbeta
(chan et al., 2000). it is plausible that such synergy also exists
for the contractile 5-ht responses mediated through 5-ht1b
receptors, coupled to gi protein, and 5-ht2a receptors, coupled
to gq protein. the synergy could be decreased when the 124c
 xxxg1109xxx , in addition to the f124  xxxg1109xxx ,
coexists with the  xxxg1113xxx  in arterial smooth muscle
cells in heterozygous individuals. since the 124c 5-ht1b
receptor is less tightly coupled to gi protein than the f124 5ht1b receptor (kiel et al., 2000), fewer betagamma units would become
available to stimulate phospholipase cbeta.
5-ht1b promoter polymorphisms. a promoter polymorphism (a-161t) in the  xxxg1109xxx  gene was independently
identified by several groups (cigler et al., 2001; sanders et al.,
2001; sun et al., 2002). the frequency of the − 161t allele
varies between 0 and 33% in different ethnic groups (sanders et
al., 2001) and this allele was shown in reporter gene assays to
lead to more efficient (up to about doubled) transcriptional
activity in carcinoma cell lines (sun et al., 2002). conversely,
duan et al. (2003) found in reporter gene assays in neuronal cell
lines that a haplotype containing the -161t allele reversed the
enhanced transcriptional activity observed by the -261g variant
at the t-261g polymorphic site. they concluded that -261g
generates a new ap2 binding site, while the alleles a-161 and
-161t display different binding characteristics to  xxxg1222xxx . changes
in 5-ht1b transcriptional activity could be relevant for 5-ht1bmediated vasoconstriction. whereas we are not aware of any
reports on such possible associations for the a-161t polymorphism, maassenvandenbrink et al. (1998b) looked for
associations of the t-261g polymorphism as well as g861c
(synonymous polymorphism) with clinical response to sumatriptan in migraine patients, but did not find different allele
frequencies between groups of patients with different clinical
response.
other 5-ht1b polymorphisms. three other 5-ht1b coding
region variants have been detected, which appear at lower
frequencies (minor allele frequency less than 1%) (sanders et
al., 2001). these are f219l (conservative amino acid change)
in transmembrane domain (tm) 5, i367v (conservative
amino acid change) in tm7 and e374l (acidic to basic
amino acid change) in the intracellular c-terminal domain.
based on comparison with analogous receptors (orthologs) in
other mammals, sanders et al. (2001) concluded that each of
these 3 variants probably represents a tolerable change in
terms of receptor function. however, studies using, for
example, site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the pharmacological properties and their cardiovascular relevance of each
variant receptor to validate this conclusion are lacking. one
other variant, a772g, was also detected and reported as a
silent change (sun et al., 2002), although it would be
predicted to result in a non-conservative amino acid change
(thr258ala, hydrophilic neutral to hydrophobic) (sanders et
al., 2002).

5.1.2. polymorphisms in 5-ht2 receptors
5.1.2.1. polymorphisms in the  xxxg1113xxx . given that
the  xxxg1113xxx  plays important roles in the human
cardiovascular system, both in blood vessel contraction and
platelet aggregation, effects of mutations in this receptor on
cardiovascular function could be expected. to date, at least 16
snps in the  xxxg1113xxx  gene have been described, of
which 9 are in the promoter, 2 are synonymous coding-region
polymorphisms and 5 are non-synonymous coding-region
polymorphisms and thus give a change in the receptor protein
(erdmann et al., 1996a; ozaki et al., 1996; spurlock et al., 1998;
cargill et al., 1999; sanders-bush et al., 2003).
t102c, a-1438g,  xxxg1113xxx  expression and disease.
polymorphisms in the 5-ht2a promoter could be relevant for
cardiovascular function if these lead to altered receptor
transcription. the promoter polymorphism which has been
most thoroughly investigated is the a-1438g polymorphism,
which is in almost complete linkage disequilibrium (i.e. almost
complete genetic linkage) with the synonymous t102c
polymorphism, so that a-1438 will almost always coexist
with t102 (spurlock et al., 1998). several association studies
have been performed and indicate an association of the 102c
allele with schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders
(williams et al., 1997; arranz et al., 1996, 1998). however,
studies aimed at explaining this association with altered 5-ht2a
receptor expression due to the strong genetic linkage between
t102c and a-1438g have so far resulted in conflicting results
(spurlock et al., 1998; parsons et al., 2004).
on this background of studies on receptors in the cns and
associations with neuropsychiatric disorders, it is interesting to
note that yamada et al. (2000) found an association between the
t102 allele and non-fatal myocardial infarction in a study of
255 japanese patients and as many matched controls. in a later
report, the same group found that the a-1438 and the t102
allele was associated with a hypersensitivity of platelets to 5-ht
(shimizu et al., 2003). recently, ozdener et al. (2005) found an
increased aggregation response to 5-ht in platelets from
patients homozygous for the t102 allele compared to those
carrying the 102c allele. these reports are compatible with a
hypothesis that increased transcriptional activity of the 5-ht2a
promoter through increased 5-ht2a expression in platelets and
increased liability to thrombotic events would be a predisposing
factor to myocardial infarction. however, in a study of 210
spanish patients with myocardial infarction before age 55
compared to age-matched controls as well as 95 patients with
myocardial infarction after age 60 there was no association with
the t102c polymorphism (coto et al., 2003). an unexplained
association between the t102c polymorphism and hdl
cholesterol levels has also been reported (choi et al., 2005).
more studies of association between the t102c/a-1438g
polymorphism and cardiovascular disease are warranted.
5-ht2a polymorphisms resulting in amino acid change. the
5 known non-synonymous coding region polymorphisms in the
 xxxg1113xxx  are (minor allele frequencies in parentheses)
t25n (1%), i197v (1%), s421f (unknown), a447v (1%) and
h452y (9%) (erdmann et al., 1996a; ozaki et al., 1996; cargill

a.j. kaumann, f.o. levy / pharmacology & therapeutics 111 (2006) 674–706

et al., 1999; reviewed by sanders-bush et al., 2003). sandersbush et al. (2003) reported preliminary data in a review paper to
indicate that the variants i197v, a447v and h452y all
displayed reduced maximum phosphoinositide hydrolysis
following 5-ht treatment of nih3t3 cells stably expressing
5-ht2a variants. an early study comparing platelets from
heterozygous ( xxxd2494xxx /452y) and homozygous ( xxxd2494xxx / xxxd2494xxx )
patients indicated that the 452y variant resulted in a blunted
ca2+ signal in response to 5-ht (ozaki et al., 1997). this was
further addressed by hazelwood & sanders-bush (2004) who
compared the signaling function of  xxxd2494xxx  and 452y human 5ht2a receptors expressed in nih3t3 cells and found that the
452y variant displayed a reduced ability to convey agoniststimulation of both phospholipase c and phospholipase d
activity, a loss of high-affinity agonist binding and altered
desensitisation properties. the s421f variant was examined in
the context of a systematic screen for serine residues involved in
 xxxg1113xxx  desensitisation (gray et al., 2003) and the 421f
variant was found to display greatly attenuated agonistmediated desensitisation. thus,  xxxg1113xxx  snps have
profound functional consequences on  xxxg1113xxx  function
and regulation and it is plausible to expect that further studies
will reveal relevance for cardiovascular disease.
5.1.2.2. polymorphisms in the  xxxg1114xxx . a patient
with fenfluramine-associated primary pulmonary hypertension
was found to carry a snp (c n t) in the  xxxg1114xxx  coding
region, resulting in premature termination (r393x) with
removal of the bulk of the intracellular c-terminal tail, including
the palmitylation site (blanpain et al., 2003). this mutation was
initially characterised as a loss-of-function mutation, since the
truncated receptor when expressed in cos or cho cells failed
to activate inositol phosphate production and subsequent [ca2+]i
increase, despite normal expression at the cell membrane and
ligand binding (blanpain et al., 2003). this apparent loss of
function was not easily reconciled with the putative involvement of  xxxg1114xxx  stimulation in the pathogenesis of
primary pulmonary hypertension (eickelberg et al., 2003).
however, later work (deraet et al., 2005) demonstrated that
while the 393x variant had indeed lost its ability to couple to
galphaq, it had gained efficacy in promoting 5-ht-stimulated cell
proliferation through galpha13, associated with and possibly
resulting from an essential lack of 5-ht-induced internalisation
(see also section 5.3.2).
a double-mutant (r6g/e42g) of the  xxxg1114xxx ,
resulting from 2 linked snps, was associated with vulnerability
to illegal drug abuse (lin et al., 2004). pharmacological
characterisation and studies of possible association of this
double mutant receptor with cardiovascular disease is
warranted.
5.1.3. polymorphisms in the  xxxg1116xxx 
several polymorphisms have been found in the  xxxg1116xxx 
(kaiser et al., 2004; kurzwelly et al., 2004) and 5-ht3b
(tremblay et al., 2003) genes, but there are as yet no studies
available to indicate important roles of such polymorphisms for
the sensitivity to reflex bradycardia or cardiac pain.

687

5.1.4. polymorphisms in the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
with the impressive amount of c-terminal splice variants
reported, genetic variation in the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor gene could lead
not only to altered transcription or pharmacological properties,
but also to altered mrna splicing. however, although reports
on  xxxg1117xxx  receptor gene polymorphisms have began to appear
(ohtsuki et al., 2002; suzuki et al., 2003), there is yet a lack of
data to warrant conclusions about their cardiovascular significance in, for example, arrhythmia or heart failure.
5.1.5. polymorphisms in the 5-ht7 receptor
two receptor variants (p279l and t92k) and one silent
(a1233g) polymorphism were identified in an early screen of
the 5-ht7 receptor gene (erdmann et al., 1996b). the 279l
variant, with a proline to leucine change in the third intracellular
loop of the receptor, showed a severely impaired ability to
stimulate camp formation in transfected hek293 cells, with
maximum values of only 9–11% of those seen with the p279
variant (kiel et al., 2003). if the 5-ht7 receptor is important in
vascular ralaxation, this could be of significance. however, as
yet, no studies have addressed possible cardiovascular phenotypes associated with this variant. the t92k variant, with an
amino acid change in the first transmembrane domain, was
found to display reduced binding affinity and agonist potency of
several agonists, whereas the affinity of several antagonists was
unchanged (brüss et al., 2005). the physiological and
cardiovascular significance of this variant remains unexplored.
additional variants of 5-ht7 and other 5-ht receptors were
recently reported and warrant further studies (glatt et al., 2004).
5.2. heart disease
5.2.1. physiological role of 5-hydroxytryptamine
5-ht is the physiological excitatory neurotransmitter of
cardiac nerves in molluscs (greenberg, 1960a) but the receptors
have a pharmacology (greenberg, 1960b) that is unrelated to the
pharmacology of 5-ht receptors occurring in mammalian heart.
evolution has replaced 5-ht by catecholamines as excitatory
neurotransmitters of cardiac nerves in higher species. although
5-ht also has excitatory effects in human adult myocardium
these would be harmful (see below) and its physiological role is
unknown. however, based mostly on work with murine
myocardium, it is plausible that 5-ht has a physiological role
in human cardiac embryogenesis as it appears to have in mice.
5-ht is synthesised by tryptophan hydroxylase (tph),  xxxg2315xxx  in
enterochromaffin cells and the pineal gland and  xxxg2256xxx  in
neurons (côté et al., 2003). when the  xxxg2315xxx  gene has been
inactivated in mice ( xxxg2315xxx −/− mutant) some of these animals
develop cardiac dysfunction and heart failure without demonstrable structural alterations together with a 92% drop in plasma
5-ht, due to lack of 5-ht synthesis by the enterochromaffin
cells. côté et al. (2003) postulated that the lack of 5-ht was
deleterious to heart function. however, the nature of the
plausible function of 5-ht in maintaining normal cardiac
function is unknown.
in mice the  xxxg1114xxx  appears to have an obligatory
role for normal cardiac embryogenesis. genetic ablation of 5-

ht2b receptors causes partial lethality in midgestation and
ventricular trabeculation defects (nebigil et al., 2000a).
midgestation mortality of the 5-ht2b knock-out mice has
been attributed to an impairment of the ability of the 5-ht2b of
wild-type mice to transduce mitogenic signals in fibroblasts
(nebigil et al., 2000b). in addition, 5-ht2b receptors have
antiapoptotic properties in murine cardiocytes (nebigil et al.,
2003). whether these functions of the 5-ht2b receptors occur in
the developing human heart is unknown. although  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors mediate human cardiostimulation, cardiac dysfunction
has not been reported in  xxxg1117xxx  knockout mice (compan et al.,
2004).
5.2.2. pathological role of 5-hydroxytryptamine
harmful effects of 5-ht are due to platelet-released 5-ht
which can produce thrombogenesis, vascular spasm, mitogenesis and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. the
endocardium protects the myocardium by preventing platelet
aggregation, but when the endocardium is damaged as for
example in dilated left atria of patients with heart disease
platelet aggregation and secretion is facilitated (shah et al.,
1989) and 5-ht can exert harmful effects on myocardial cells
(kaumann, 1994). plasma levels of 5-ht, originated from
enterochomaffin cells, appear to be elevated in patients with
congestive heart failure (chandra et al., 1994; vizir & berezin,
2001). in addition, the human heart itself stores and perhaps
synthesises 5-ht. human left ventricular myocardium contains
∼ 400 ng 5-ht g− 1 (sole et al., 1979) but its histological
localisation was unknown. tryptophan hydroxylase and 5-ht
immunoreactivity has been demonstrated histochemically in
neurons of cardiac ganglia of human transmural cardiac tissue,
consistent with synthesis of 5-ht (singh et al., 1999). 5-ht can
be captured by sympathetic nerve endings in human atrial
trabeculae, released with field stimulation and increase
contractility through  xxxg1117xxx  receptors, thus plausibly act as a
false neurotransmitter (kaumann, 2000).
polymorphic alterations of the 5-ht transporter ( xxxg2150xxx )
of platelets are associated with a higher risk of myocardial
infarction (fumeron et al., 2002). the  xxxg2150xxx  is encoded by a
single gene expressed in neurons, platelets, as well as
endothelial, vascular and other cells. human  xxxg2150xxx  expression is determined genetically by an insertion/deletion
polymorphism in the promoter region of the gene with long
(l) and short (s) forms (lesch et al., 1996). the l allele
doubles or triples the rate of  xxxg2150xxx  gene transcription
compared to the s allele (heils et al., 1996), reflected by
greater  xxxg2150xxx  mrna and protein levels and 5-ht uptake
into lymphoblasts with the ll genotype compared to the ss
and ls genotypes (lesch et al., 1996). individuals with the
ll and ls genotypes had significantly higher blood 5-ht
than did those with the ss genotype (hanna et al., 1998).
furthermore, because of greater 5-ht platelet storage, platelet
activation is greater in a group of clinically depressed patients
with the  xxxg2150xxx  ll genotype than with other genotypes and
this may facilitate ischaemic heart disease (whyte et al.,
2001). similar conclusions were made from a study with
japanese individuals in which the l allele of the  xxxg2150xxx  was

associated with coronary heart disease in smokers (arinami et
al., 1999).
conversely, the lower  xxxg2150xxx  expression in platelets results
in lower 5-ht uptake and less 5-ht available for release,
thereby reducing the risk of platelet aggregation, thrombus
formation and vascular spasm. as expected, patients with the
ss  xxxg2150xxx  genotype appear to have a lower risk of myocardial
infarction, delaying the age of onset, in particular among
smokers (coto et al., 2003). antidepressants that are inhibitors
of 5-ht uptake by  xxxg2150xxx , thereby depleting platelet 5-ht
storage and reducing function (hergovich et al., 2000), also
reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction; increasing
transporter affinity correlates with greater protection (sauer et
al., 2003). selective inhibitors of 5-ht uptake by  xxxg2150xxx  further
inhibit platelet function in patients with congestive heart failure
already on aspirin (serebruany et al., 2003).
platelet aggregation at ruptured atheromatous plaques occurs
through binding of  xxxg2423xxx  and fibrinogen to the
platelet surface receptor, glycoprotein iib/iiia (jang et al.,
1994). a polymorphism of  xxxg1210xxx  gene, pia2
(newman et al., 1989) was found to be associated with acute
coronary thrombosis in a younger population with high
prevalence of smokers (weiss et al., 1996) but not in another
study with a cohort of healthy men, mostly non-smokers
(ridker et al., 1997). however, the risk of myocardial infarction
appears to be increased with a combination of the unfavorable
glycoprotein iiia pia polymorphism with the ll genotype of
the  xxxg2150xxx  (schwartz et al., 2003).
5.2.2.1. atrial fibrillation. the endogenously occurring
agonists noradrenaline, adrenaline, histamine and 5-ht can
trigger experimental arrhythmias mediated through the gsprotein-coupled  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors, beta2-adrenoceptors, histamine
h2 receptors and  xxxg1117xxx  receptors respectively, in human atrial
trabeculae. the incidence of these arrhythmias is consistently
enhanced in atrial trabeculae (kaumann & sanders, 1993;
kaumann & sanders, 1994; sanders et al., 1996) and myocytes
(pau et al., 2003), obtained from patients chronically treated
with  xxxg836xxx -selective blockers. the pro-arrhythmic effects of 5-ht,
mediated through human atrial  xxxg1117xxx  receptors, are probably
mainly related to ca2+ overload (kaumann, 1994), produced
through an increase in l-type ca2+ current (ica,l). the effects of
5-ht on ica,l are as marked as those of  xxxd2398xxx  (up to 6fold increases in ica,l; ouadid et al., 1992; jahnel et al., 1993).
matching increases of ica,l by 5-ht and  xxxd2398xxx  are
associated with  xxxd1773xxx , pka and inotropic signals of 5-ht
only approximately half as great as the corresponding signals of
 xxxd2398xxx  (kaumann et al., 1990). this paradox suggests that
pka-catalysed phosphorylation of the l-type ca2+ channel via
 xxxg1117xxx -receptors (ouadid et al., 1992) is more efficient than via
beta-adrenoceptors. alternatively, part of the  xxxd2398xxx -evoked
 xxxd1773xxx  and pka signals (kaumann et al., 1990) could be
unrelated to signals at the microscopic level of the l-type ca2+
channels. however, the maximum inotropic signal of 5-ht is
also only half of that of  xxxd2398xxx , in line with the smaller
biochemical signals (kaumann et al., 1990). this suggests that
ca2+-induced ca2+ release is smaller through  xxxg1117xxx  receptors

a.j. kaumann, f.o. levy / pharmacology & therapeutics 111 (2006) 674–706

than through beta-adrenoceptors, although pka-induced phosphorylation of ryanodine ryr2 ca2+ release channels and
phospholamban could also be smaller. it is interesting in this
context that in atrial trabeculae of patients with chronic atrial
fibrillation the contractile responses to 5-ht are nearly
abolished while still nearly maximum ica,l signals could be
elicited with 5-ht in atrial myocytes through  xxxg1117xxx  receptors,
suggesting a marked impairment of ca2+-induced ca2+ release
(christ et al., 2005). however, a decrease in 5-ht potency as
enhancer of ica,l has also been observed in atrial myocytes from
patients with atrial fibrillation (christ et al., 2005; pau et al.,
2005b), possibly due to  xxxg1117xxx  receptor desensitisation and/or
greater activity of pde.
as suggested above (section 3.2.1), the increased arrhythmic
(kaumann & sanders, 1994; sanders et al., 1995; pau et al.,
2003) responses to 5-ht through  xxxg1117xxx  receptors in atrial
myocardium of patients chronically treated with  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor-selective blockers, could be related to a decreased gi protein
function. consistent with a role of gi protein, the inhibition of gi
protein with ptx enhances the responses of a low 5-ht
concentration on the hyperpolarising current if (lonardo et al.,
2005). because in addition to coupling to gs,  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptors,
but not coexisting  xxxg1117xxx (a) receptors (bach et al., 2001), appear
also to couple to gi (pindon et al., 2002), the effects of 5-ht on if
are consistent with mediation through  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptors in
human atrial myocytes. the shift of the if activation curve by 5ht and catecholamines toward less negative potentials has been
proposed to facilitate arrhythmias (pino et al., 1998; lonardo et
al., 2005). the effects of adrenaline on if, mediated through beta2adrenoceptors, but not the effects of noradrenaline, mediated
through  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors, are also enhanced by ptx (lonardo
et al., 2005), consistent with coupling of beta2- but not beta1adrenoceptors to gi protein. however, the incidence of
arrhythmias is not only higher through beta2-adrenoceptors but
also through  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors in atrial trabeculae from patients
chronically treated with  xxxg836xxx -selective blockers (kaumann &
sanders, 1993; kaumann et al., 1995). therefore factors
unrelated to receptor-coupling to gi protein appear to contribute
to the arrhythmic hyperresponsiveness to noradrenaline. gi
inhibition with ptx should also be investigated on the effects of
5-ht on ica,l and be compared with the effects of noradrenaline
and adrenaline through  xxxg836xxx - and beta2-adrenoceptors.
focal activity in human pulmonary veins often initiates
(haissaguerre et al., 1998) but can also maintain atrial
fibrillation (haissaguerre et al., 2004a) and isolation and
electrical ablation of pulmonary veins significantly terminates
the arrhythmia (haissaguerre et al., 2004b). atrial myocardial
sleeves extend into the pulmonary veins (saito et al., 2001;
becker, 2004). since functional  xxxg1117xxx  receptors have been
detected in human left atrium (sanders & kaumann, 1992), it is
conceivable that the left atrial sleeves extending into the
pulmonary veins may also possess  xxxg1117xxx  receptors. activation
of these receptors by 5-ht could conceivably initiate atrial
fibrillation in some pulmonary veins and  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
blockers would be expected to prevent the arrhythmias. this
hypothesis requires experimental testing. the more general
proposal for using  xxxg1117xxx  receptor-selective antagonists in atrial

689

fibrillation (kaumann, 1994) still needs clinical verification.
due to the inotropic and electrophysiological changes of the 5ht responses in atrial myocytes from patients with chronic
atrial fibrillation, compared to myocytes from patients with
sinus rhythm (christ et al., 2005; pau et al., 2005b), it is
plausible that  xxxg1117xxx  receptor-selective blockers will be more
effective in preventing the initiation of atrial fibrillation in some
cases than aborting chronic fibrillation due to profound
remodelling (wijffels et al., 1995; nattel, 2002).
experiments on porcine atrium are consistent with the
hypothesis that 5-ht contributes to the generation of atrial
fibrillation and flutter. the porcine left atrium possesses
functional  xxxg1117xxx  receptors (parker et al., 1995) and has been
used as a model for human  xxxg1117xxx  receptor-mediated atrial
fibrillation (rahme et al., 1999). the  xxxg1117xxx -selective antagonist
rs100302 terminated electrically induced atrial fibrillation and
flutter and reintroduced sinoatrial rhythm in porcine atria. the
thoracotomy and suturing of the mapping plaque to the porcine
atrium might have caused 5-ht release and  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
activation (rahme et al., 1999).
the inotropic effects of 5-ht on human atrium, mediated
through  xxxg1117xxx  receptors, can fade (sanders & kaumann, 1992),
probably due to the hydrolysis of  xxxd1773xxx  by pde
(kaumann & levy, 2006). fade of human atrial inotropic
responses to 5-ht was reduced by the selective  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor
cilostamide but not by the pde4-selective inhibitor  xxxd3142xxx ,
consistent with  xxxg1695xxx -catalysed  xxxd1773xxx  hydrolysis (a.
galindo-tovar & a. kaumann, unpublished observation).
 xxxg1695xxx  activity may prevent harmful cardiostimulation through
 xxxg1117xxx  receptors. the  xxxg1695xxx -selective inhibitor milrinone causes
arrhythmias and increases mortality in heart failure (packer et
al., 1991). conceivably,  xxxg1117xxx  receptor-mediated arrhythmias
could be one of the factors that contributed to the harmful
effects of milrinone. inotropic fade has also been observed with
 xxxg1117xxx  receptor partial agonists (kaumann et al., 1991). since 5ht4 partial agonists are used in irritable bowel syndrome, their
combination with a  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor should probably be avoided,
to prevent the appearance of possible arrhythmias (kaumann &
levy, 2006).
5.2.2.2. heart failure. 5-ht released from platelets (kaumann, 1994) or as a false neurotransmitter from sympathetic
nerve endings (kaumann, 2000) could elicit harmful arrhythmias in heart failure. consistent with this hypothesis are the
experimental arrhythmias observed on human atrial trabeculae
(kaumann & sanders, 1994) and human ventricular trabeculae
from failing hearts (brattelid et al., 2004b). since the
experimental arrhythmias are produced by 5-ht through 5ht4 receptors, chronic administration of a  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
blocker would be expected to prevent the arrhythmias triggered
by 5-ht (kaumann, 1994).
5-ht can also enhance the contractility and hasten relaxation
of human atrial and ventricular trabeculae through  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors in preparations from failing hearts (sanders &
kaumann, 1992; brattelid et al., 2004b), thereby conceivably
creating an overdemand of oxygen in an already oxygen-starved
heart. as in 5-ht-evoked arrhythmias,  xxxg1117xxx  blockers should

provide some benefit in heart failure by preventing harmful
cardiostimulation (qvigstad et al., 2005c).
since ventricular effects of 5-ht become conspicuous in the
presence of non-selective inhibition of pde with  xxxd2388xxx , it was
proposed that pdes have a protective role against the potentially
harmful effects of 5-ht (brattelid et al., 2004b). to investigate
which pde isoenzymes are involved, preliminary experiments
show that the selective  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor milrinone, but not the
selective pde4 inhibitor  xxxd3142xxx , facilitates the appearance of
positive inotropic and lusitropic responses to 5-ht in ventricular
trabeculae obtained from human failing hearts (e. qvigstad, f.
afzal et al., unpublished data). these findings are consistent
with the attenuation by  xxxg1695xxx -selective cilostamide of the fade of
inotropic responses to 5-ht in human atrium (section 5.2.2.1),
suggesting that  xxxg1695xxx  is the isoenzyme that prevents undue
cardiac overstimulation in human heart.
the positive inotropic, lusitropic and arrhythmic effects of 5ht, mediated through  xxxg1117xxx  receptors, have been observed in
human ventricular trabeculae from terminally failing hearts
(brattelid et al., 2004b). although atria from rats with nonfailing hearts express  xxxg1117xxx  mrna (gerald et al., 1995), 5-ht
increases atrial contractility through 5-ht2a receptors but not
through  xxxg1117xxx  receptors in this species (kaumann, 1991; läer
et al., 1998) and 5-ht does not affect ventricular contractility
(läer et al., 1998). however, myocardial infarction, induced by
coronary artery ligation, followed by heart failure, uncovers
functional ventricular cardiostimulation through both 5-ht2a
and  xxxg1117xxx  receptors (qvigstad et al., 2005a, 2005b). three days
after coronary ligation rats with acute heart failure exhibit
increases in contractility of the left ventricular papillary muscle,
mainly mediated through 5-ht2a receptors, accompanied by
myosin light chain-2 phosphorylation (qvigstad et al., 2005b)
and a small increase in contractility through  xxxg1117xxx  receptors. at
present, however, there is no evidence for the existence and
function of human myocardial 5-ht2a receptors.
in rats, 6 weeks after coronary ligation and with chronic heart
failure, 5-ht increases contractility and hastens relaxation
accompanied by a small  xxxd1773xxx  signal, almost exclusively
through  xxxg1117xxx  receptors (qvigstad et al., 2005a). as in human
heart failure (brattelid et al., 2004b)  xxxg1117xxx  mrna is increased
4-fold in chronic rat heart failure (qvigstad et al., 2005a). the
failing rat heart, 6 weeks after coronary ligation, therefore
appears to be an interesting model for ventricular  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors of failing human heart. the appearance of functional
 xxxg1117xxx  receptors in the infarcted and failing rat heart (qvigstad et
al., 2005a) suggests transformation into a phenotype that differs
from the phenotype of normal hearts, raising the possibility of an
equivalent phenotype change in human failing and infarcted
hearts. however, against this hypothesis are recent experiments
demonstrating positive inotropic effects of 5-ht in ventricular
trabeculae from 2 non-failing human donor hearts, observed in
the absence of  xxxd2388xxx  (e. qvigstad et al., unpublished data).
heart failure often starts with hypertrophy followed by
fibrosis as demonstrated in mice with heart failure induced by
overexpression of  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors (engelhardt et al., 1999).
of relevance, cardiac hypertrophy by chronic  xxxd2398xxx 
perfusion in mice is prevented by the 5-ht2b-selective

antagonist sb206553 and absent in  xxxg1114xxx  knockout mice (jaffré et al., 2004).  xxxd2398xxx  perfusion also caused
an increase of plasma levels of the cytokines interleukin-1beta and
 xxxg2296xxx -alpha and these effects were equally
prevented by sb206553 and absent in 5-ht2b knock-out
mice. remarkably, the blockade of the  xxxd2398xxx -induced
effects, including the production of cytokines by fibroblasts,
occurred in the absence of 5-ht, suggesting the existence of
complexes (heterodimers?) between 5-ht2b receptors and beta1adrenoceptors (jaffré et al., 2004). these interesting findings
must await verification in the human failing heart.
5-ht may also contribute indirectly to heart failure by
stimulating aldosterone biosynthesis (müller & ziegler, 1968)
and secretion. high plasma aldosterone levels are associated
with left ventricular hypertrophy (duprez et al., 1996), heart
failure and mortality (swedberg et al., 1990) and treatment with
 xxxg1602xxx  antagonists reduces mortality (pitts et al.,
1999, 2003). aldosterone secretion is enhanced in volunteers by
the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor partial agonists zacopride (lefebvre et al.,
1993), metoclopramide (sommers et al., 1996) and  xxxd1708xxx 
(lefebvre et al., 1993; huang et al., 1997). interestingly,
sommers et al. (1996) also reported a decrease of aldosterone
secretion with the 5-ht3/ xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonist  xxxd3451xxx ,
consistent with tonic 5-ht-evoked aldosterone secretion
through  xxxg1117xxx  receptors. 5-ht is localised and released from
perivascular mast cells in human adrenal slices and causes
cortisol secretion and an increase of  xxxd1773xxx  through  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors (lefebvre et al., 1992). depletion of mast cell 5-ht
with compound 48/80 in perfused human adrenocortical
explants causes marked release of 5-ht and secretion of
aldosterone (lefebvre et al., 2001). the 5-ht precursor, 5hydroxytryptophan (shenker et al., 1985) and  xxxd1708xxx  increase
plasma aldosterone levels in patients with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (lefebvre et al., 2000) and in patients with
adrenocortical aldosterone-producing adenomas (lefebvre et
al., 2002) without modifying renin, cortisol and potassium
levels. 5-ht- and  xxxd1708xxx -induced aldosterone secretion,
inhibited by the  xxxg1117xxx -selective antagonist gr113808, occurs
through  xxxg1117xxx  receptors located in adrenal glomerulosa cells
(lefebvre et al., 2002). activation of adrenocortical  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors increases both  xxxd1773xxx  and ca2+ influx through ttype ca2+ channels, thereby leading to corticosteroid and
aldosterone secretion (contesse et al., 1996). the major effect
of increased adrenocortical cell ca2+ is to increase steroidogenesis. increased extracellular k + enhances aldosterone
secretion by causing membrane depolarisation, thereby also
activating voltage-dependent t-type ca2+ channels and eliciting
a rapid rise in intracellular ca2+, which in turn activates
calmodulin (cam) kinases. cam kinases then phosphorylate
transcription factors, including camp-response element (cre)binding protein (creb; reviewed in spät & hunyady, 2004), a
pathway also plausibly activated through adrenocortical  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors. the enhanced ca2+ influx stimulates ca2+-dependent
adenylyl cyclase ac3, expressed in human glomerulosa cells
(côté et al., 2001), thereby increasing  xxxd1773xxx  levels,
activating pka, which in turn appears involved in the transfer
of aldosterone-precursor cholesterol from cytoplasm into the

a.j. kaumann, f.o. levy / pharmacology & therapeutics 111 (2006) 674–706

inner mitochondrial membrane (spät & hunyady, 2004). the
discussed evidence suggests that 5-ht conceivably is a factor
that, in addition to  xxxg99xxx  and high k+, enhances
aldosterone secretion in heart failure. blockade of adrenocortical  xxxg1117xxx  receptors could therefore bring benefit in heart
failure.
5.2.2.3. cardiac pain and 5-ht3 receptors? intravenous
administration of 5-ht produces sensations of pain in humans
(hollander et al., 1957; le mesurier et al., 1959) and equivalent
pseudoaffective responses in several animal models (reviewed
by meller & gebhart, 1992). cardiac sympathetic afferents,
activated during cardiac ischaemia (uchida & murao, 1974),
transmit nociceptive information from the heart to the cns to
elicit the perception of pain. both exogenous 5-ht (nishi et al.,
1977; fu & longhurst, 2002) and platelet-derived 5-ht (fu &
longhurst, 2002) stimulate afferent cardiac sympathetic adelta
fibers and c-fibers during experimental cardiac ischaemia in
cats and these effects are prevented by  xxxd3451xxx  through
blockade of neuronal 5-ht3 receptors (fu & longhurst, 2002).
a hypothetical contribution of 5-ht3 receptors in the
transmission of nociceptive stimuli from myocardial ischaemia
in human heart needs to be investigated.
5.2.2.4.  xxxg1117xxx  receptor autoantibodies and congenital heart
block. congenital heart block (chb), detected before or at
birth in infants from mothers with systemic lupus erythematosus
(sle), is frequently associated with maternal autoantibodies
against ribonucleoproteins ssa/ro and/or ssb/la. antibodies
to the 52-kd ssa/ro protein (ro-52) causes atrioventricular
(av) block in the perfused human fetal heart and inhibits l-type
ca2+ currents ica,l. the inhibition of ica,l is due to shorter open
times and longer closed times of the channels (boutjdir et al.,
1997). these changes in ica,l are opposite to those caused by 5ht through  xxxg1117xxx  receptors that increases ica,l, lengthens open
times and shortens closed times (jahnel et al., 1993).
using a synthetic peptide, g21v, corresponding to the
second extracellular loop of the human  xxxg1117xxx  receptor,
eftekhari et al. (2000) were able to affinity-purify anti-g21vautoantibodies which recognised both the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor and
the ro52 protein, demonstrating the existence of cross-reactive
epitopes. they found that 17 of 26 sle patients responded
positively in a direct enzyme immunoassay with the g21v
peptide. eftekhari et al. (2000) also showed that the affinitypurified anti-g21v antibody partially antagonised the 5-htinduced increases in ica,l on human atrial myocytes. subsequently eftekhari et al. (2001) immunised mice with g21v and
several ro52-derived peptides and the mice developed antipeptide antibodies. peptide-immune mice were mated and the
pups monitored 2 days after birth. mice immunised with 5-ht4derived g21v produced stillborn pups with hearts of decreased
size presenting hyperplasia. living pups had sinus bradycardia
and increased qt interval but only 13% had av block; these
mice also had skin rash. interestingly,  xxxg1117xxx  receptors were
demonstrable in heart but not anymore 5 days after birth. the
authors concluded that neonatal lupus is an autoimmune anti-5ht4 receptor fetal disease. however, mice immunised with ro-

691

52-derived peptides did not show av block or skin rash, which
is puzzling.
although the  xxxg1117xxx  autoantibody hypothesis is interesting, it
does not explain why antibody against the ro-52 protein causes
av block and inhibits ica,l unless it is assumed that the
myocytes from human fetal hearts of the work of boutjdir et al.
(1997) possessed  xxxg1117xxx  receptors that constitutively (i.e. in the
absence of 5-ht) opened ica,l. alternatively, unlike adult
murine hearts devoid of  xxxg1117xxx  receptor function, fetal hearts
may actually express functional  xxxg1117xxx  receptors activated with
5-ht from the maternal blood.
a recent reassessment of 101 anti-ssa/ro52-positive
mothers yielded 74 chb children, only 12 chb were reactive
with the  xxxg1117xxx  peptide while 73 had circulating anti-ssa/ro52
autoantibodies (kamel et al., 2005). despite the lack of
generality of these findings, a putative physiological role of 5ht4 receptors in the developing heart should be taken seriously
and awaits further research.
5.2.2.5. valvular heart disease. 5-ht and serotonergic
medications can induce valvular heart disease (vhd). carcinoid tumours cause usually right-side vhd by endogenously
released 5-ht in 2/3 of the patients (kulke & mayer, 1999).
left-side vhd occurs in less than 10% of patients (robiolio et
al., 1995). 5-ht released from the enterochromaffin cells of the
gut is mostly captured by platelets in the portal circulation. nonplatelet bound 5-ht is metabolised by monoamine oxidases in
the liver and lung to 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-hiaa),
thereby usually sparing the cardiac left-side valves from
exposure to high 5-ht levels. patients with carcinoid syndrome
have high levels of plasma 5-ht and platelet-bound 5-ht, as
well as urinary 5-hiaa (robiolio et al., 1995), but also
increased levels of tachykinins and bradykinin (lundin et al.,
1988). in vhd tricuspid valve function is consistently affected
but pulmonary valve function is also often perturbed (møller et
al., 2003). valve lesions consist of carcinoid plaques containing
subendocardial deposits of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells
in a myxoid matrix (ferrans & roberts, 1976; sakai et al.,
2000), associated with triscuspid and pulmonary valve
malfunction (møller et al., 2003). similar lesions were
mimicked in tricuspid and aortic valves, accompanied by
valve malfunction, in rats chronically (3 months) injected with
5-ht, indicating an etiological role of 5-ht (gustafsson et al.,
2005). these findings point to a pathogenic role of 5-ht in
vhd, although a contribution of tachykinins and bradykinin
cannot be ruled out.
proliferative plaques of mitral valve and/or thickening of
both tricuspid and aortic valves have also been observed in
patients taking anorectic drugs (fenfluramine plus phentermine;
connolly et al., 1997). it was subsequently shown that treatment
with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for four months or longer
caused aortic and mitral regurgitation in 35 cases per 10,000
(jick et al., 1998). fenfluramine and its (+)-enantiomer
dexfenfluramine are metabolised to (±)-norfenfluramine and
(+)-fenfluramine (caccia et al., 1985). fenfluramine and its
metabolites release 5-ht and it has been discussed that vhd
may be produced through increased 5-ht plasma levels

692

a.j. kaumann, f.o. levy / pharmacology & therapeutics 111 (2006) 674–706

(fishman, 1999). however, this hypothesis has been rejected
because treatment with fenfluramine–phentermine actually
decreases both plasma and platelet 5-ht but phentermine has
no significant effect (rothman et al., 2000a). instead, rothman
et al. (2000b) provided evidence from systematic screening of
11 5-ht receptor subtypes that fenfluramine and its metabolites
(±)-norfenfluramine, (+)-norfenfluramine and (−)-norfenfluramine, but not phentermine, had selectively high affinity for
5-ht2b receptors and similar observations were made independently by fitzgerald et al. (2000), consistent with a role of 5ht2b receptors in vhd. 5-ht2b receptors may also be involved
in the vhd produced by  xxxd2621xxx  and its metabolite
methylergonovine as well as ergotamine, dihydroergotamine
(creutzig, 1992) and the ergot-derivative dopamine agonist
pergolide used in parkinson's disease (horvath et al., 2004)
because these compounds also exhibited high affinity for 5ht2b receptors (rothman et al., 2000b). fenfluramine,
norfenfluramine and dihydroergotamine but also the ecstasy
drug mdma and its metabolite 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (mda) exhibit mitogenic activity by stimulating [3h]
thymidine incorporation on human valvular interstitial cells.
these effects are antagonised by the 5-ht2b/5-ht2c-selective
antagonist sb206553 (setola et al., 2003). since 5-ht2b
receptors, but hardly 5-ht2c receptors, are expressed in human
valves (fitzgerald et al., 2000), the experiments of setola et al.
(2003) are consistent with mediation of the mitogenic effects of
fenfluramine and mdma through 5-ht2b receptors.
5.3. vascular disease
5-ht receptors have been implicated in several vascular
diseases, including hypertension and preeclampsia, coronary
spasm, pulmonary hypertension, raynauds phenomenon,
migraine and portal hypertension. although the intravenous
administration of the  xxxg1113xxx -selective antagonist
 xxxd2419xxx  lowered blood pressure in hypertensive patients
(vanhoutte et al., 1988), this may have occurred through
blockade of alpha1-adrenoceptors (fozard, 1982) and/or suppression of the amplification of noradrenaline responses by 5-ht
(van nueten & janssens, 1986; van nueten et al., 1988).
vascular endothelium is damaged in preeclampsia (zeeman
& dekker, 1992). the reduction of the protective endothelial
function may facilitate platelet aggregation with 5-ht release
and interaction with smooth muscle 5-ht receptors. although
 xxxd2419xxx  treatment occasionally reduces blood pressure in
hypertensive pregnant women with preeclampsia, there is a
scarcity of appropriately designed studies (reviewed by steyn &
odendaal, 2000). the plausible participation of 5-ht and 5-ht
receptors in hypertension requires fresh research.
5.3.1. coronary spasm: different
role of 5-ht1b and 5-ht2a receptors
both 5-ht1b and 5-ht2a receptors can contribute to
coronary spasm, but often in different etiologies. both 5-ht
and sumatriptan can cause phasic contractions of isolated
human coronary artery, mimicking spasm, especially when
extracellular ca2+ is higher than 2 mm (cocks et al., 1993;

kaumann et al., 1994). 5-ht can be used to induce coronary
spasm at spastic sites of patients with variant angina (kanazawa
et al., 1997). coronary artery spasm is facilitated by the
existence of atheromatous plaques but can also occur in the
absence of atheroma (prinzmetal's variant angina). 5-ht levels
in the coronary sinus increase in patients with coronary lesions
and severe angina (rubanyi et al., 1987; van den berg et al.,
1989) and 5-ht is associated with coronary artery disease,
particularly in younger patients (vikenes et al., 1999). during
acute myocardial infarction thrombotic occlusion occurs with
platelet aggregation at ruptured plaques and release of 5-ht,
thromboxane a2 (txa2) and adenine nucleotides, which in turn
facilitate further platelet release (zucker & nachmias, 1985).
both 5-ht and sumatriptan and the txa2 agonist u46619 act
synergistically to contract human coronary artery (chester et al.,
1993; cocks et al., 1993; maassenvandenbrink et al., 1996).
the effects of 5-ht are potentiated by u46619 in the presence
of  xxxd2419xxx  and potentiation is prevented by methiothepin,
conceivably through blockade of 5-ht1b receptors (chester et
al., 1993). the marked increase of sumatriptan-induced
contractions of human coronary artery by u46619 (cocks et
al., 1993) as well as reported reduction of the intracoronary
diameter with sumatriptan (macintyre et al., 1992) is also
consistent with mediation through 5-ht1b receptors. isolated
cases of clinical coronary spasms caused by sumatriptan,
mediated through 5-ht1b receptors, have been discussed
elsewhere (cocks et al., 1993; kaumann et al., 1994 and in
section 5.3.4).
intra-coronary infusions of 5-ht cause coronary artery
constriction in patients with coronary atherosclerosis (golino et
al., 1991; mcfadden et al., 1991). golino et al. (1991) found in
patients with and without arteriosclerotic evidence that
 xxxd2419xxx  completely blocked the decrease in large coronary
arterial diameter to intracoronary infusions of 5-ht. early
reports failed to find an effect of  xxxd2419xxx  in prinzmetal's
variant angina, diagnosed with infusions of  xxxd2021xxx  (that
acts partially through 5-ht1b receptors) (decaterina et al.,
1984; freedman et al., 1984). furthermore, mcfadden et al.
(1991) also failed to block spasms caused by intracoronary
infusions of 5-ht in patients with prinzmetal's angina. a
female patient suffering from variant angina due to spasms of
the right coronary artery for 20 years, exhibited postmortem in
vitro supersensitivity to 5-ht and sumatriptan, compared to
coronary arteries from patients without prinzmetal's angina
(kaumann et al., 1994) and presumably occurring at 5-ht1b
receptors (ishida et al., 1998). taken together, the evidence with
prinzmetal's angina suggests that a  xxxg1109xxx -selective
blocker could be beneficial to prevent at least some cases of
variant angina.
5-ht levels are increased also in the coronary sinus during
vasoconstriction induced by coronary angioplasty; vasoconstriction was attenuated by  xxxd2419xxx  in 8 patients (golino et
al., 1994), consistent with  xxxg1113xxx  activation. the
contribution of 5-ht1b and  xxxg1113xxx  to coronary spasm
may depend on specific locations within the same coronary
artery. for example, in a circumflex artery from a patient with
ischaemic heart disease, presenting a thrombotic occlusion, the

a.j. kaumann, f.o. levy / pharmacology & therapeutics 111 (2006) 674–706

prestenotic segment but not the poststenotic segment presented
atheromatous plaques. 5-ht had the same contractile potency
on the prestenotic and poststenotic segments. however, 100 nm
 xxxd2419xxx  blocked most of the effect on the poststenotic
segment, consistent with mediation through 5-ht2a receptors,
but hardly the effects of 5-ht on the prestenotic segment,
probably mediated through 5-ht1b receptors (kaumann &
brown, 1990).
5.3.2. pulmonary hypertension:
role of 5-ht1b and 5-ht2b receptors
pulmonary hypertension has been associated with elevated
plasma 5-ht levels, a platelet defect that exhibits reduced 5-ht
capture, decreased 5-ht uptake and increased 5-ht release
from platelets of patients with chronic ingestion of the appetite
suppressant dexfenfluramine, as well as mutations of the  xxxg2150xxx 
(reviewed by farber & loscalzo, 2004). 5-ht contributes to
pulmonary hypertension by acting on extracellular and
intracellular sites of vascular cells.
extracellular effects of 5-ht appear mainly mediated
through 5-ht1b and 5-ht2b receptors, intracellular effects via
cellular capture of 5-ht through the 5-ht uptake transporter  xxxg2150xxx . 5-ht1b receptors mediate acute pulmonary vasoconstriction by 5-ht released through local microthrombosis but have
also been proposed to act in synergy with gq-coupled receptors
(the  xxxg1113xxx  family) by decreasing  xxxd1274xxx 
(reviewed by maclean et al., 2000). 5-ht and dexfenfluramine
chronically facilitate smooth vascular cell proliferation and
pulmonary vascular remodelling, mediated through 5-ht2b
receptors, in a model of chronic hypoxia in mice (launay et al.,
2002). although direct evidence for an involvement of human
5-ht2b receptors in pulmonary hypertension is unknown, a
mutation of the 5-ht2b gene was associated with pulmonary
hypertension in a patient undergoing a 9-month fenfluramine
treatment (blanpain et al., 2003; see also section 5.1.2.2),
suggesting a possible role in man. this mutation (393x)
appears to result in a gain of proliferative function mediated
through g13, despite loss of coupling to galphaq (deraet et al.,
2005). this implies a mechanism involving rho family small
gtpases and is in line with the beneficial effects of  xxxg1969xxx 
inhibition on sustained hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in
rats (robertson et al., 2000).
an intracellular role of 5-ht as promoter of smooth muscle
hyperplasia from human pulmonary arteries is supported by the
increased expression and function of the  xxxg2150xxx  and a greater
prevalence of the l-allelic variant in pulmonary hypertensive
patients compared to non-pulmonary hypertensive (eddahibi et
al., 2001, 2003). the same group demonstrated markedly
enhanced [3h]5-ht uptake and prevention by the uptake
blockers fluoxetine and citalopram in hyperplastic smooth
muscle cells from pulmonary hypertensive patients compared to
controls (marcos et al., 2004). interestingly, the co-expression
of smooth muscle 5-ht1b, 5-ht2a and 5-ht2b receptors was
not changed in pulmonary hypertension and blockade of these
receptors did not affect the mitogenic activity of 5-ht,
suggesting a minor role in pulmonary vascular remodelling
(marcos et al., 2004). intracellular candidates as effectors for

693

the mitogenic effects of 5-ht are uncertain. an increase of
superoxide anion production and stimulation of tyrosine
phosphorylation of gtpase-activating protein has been proposed (maclean et al., 2000). interestingly, 5-ht can be
transamidated to small gtpases by transglutaminases during
activation and aggregation of platelets, producing constitutively
active gtpases (walther et al., 2003), but whether this
mechanism is relevant to the intracellular effects in human
pulmonary artery smooth muscle needs to be investigated.
the future treatment of the 5-ht components of human
pulmonary hypertension is still uncertain. blockade of the 5-ht
transporter  xxxg2150xxx  or the 5-ht1b or 5-ht2b receptors are
possible approaches. pulmonary vascular remodelling and
increased arterial contractions in response to 5-ht, induced
by chronic hypoxia, are decreased in 5-ht1b / mice (keegan
et al., 2001). these findings, together with the demonstration of
functional 5-ht1b receptors in human pulmonary artery
(maclean et al., 2000), led to the suggestion of the use of a
selective  xxxg1109xxx  blocker in human pulmonary
hypertension (keegan et al., 2001). blockade of 5-ht2b
receptors in mice prevents pulmonary hypertension (launay
et al., 2002). on the other hand, blockade of endothelial 5-ht2b
receptors of porcine pulmonary arteries eliminates relaxation
induced by  xxxd2738xxx  release (glusa & pertz, 2000). if this
beneficial relaxation occurs in human pulmonary arteries,
blockade of the  xxxg1114xxx -mediated synthesis of nitric
oxide (ullmer et al., 1996; manivet et al., 2000) should be
contraindicated in patients with pulmonary hypertension.
although 5-ht uptake blockers may initially enhance plasma
5-ht levels, this is probably hardly of relevance because these
agents actually may protect against hypoxia-induced pulmonary
hypertension in mice (marcos et al., 2003).
5.3.3. raynaud's vasospasm
raynaud's phenomenon consists in transient episodic, coldinduced, ischaemic vasoconstriction of digital arteries, precapillary arterioles and cutaneous arteriovenous shunts. raynaud reasoned that the ischaemia was the result of an excessive
activity of sympathetic nerve endings of digital blood vessels
but lewis suggested an anomaly of the receptors responsible for
vascular vasoconstriction (reviewed in mourad & priollet,
1997). raynaud's phenomenon is, on occasion, part of a
generalised vasospastic disorder of patients with prinzmetal
angina and migraine (miller et al., 1981; o'keefe et al., 1992),
all disorders with a plausible involvement of 5-ht. a possible
role of 5-ht during the reflex sympathetic response to cooling
was provided by the attenuation with the 5-ht2a-selective
antagonist  xxxd2419xxx  of decreases in digital blood flow induced
by cooling from 25 °c to 20 °c (coffman & cohen, 1988).
these results suggest a contribution of endogenous 5-ht to
hand vascular constriction during cooling, which could also
happen during raynaud's ischaemic digital vasoconstriction,
but the origin of 5-ht is unknown. studies on platelet-bound
and extra-platelet 5-ht are contradictory. biondi et al. (1988)
found increased platelet and plasma free 5-ht in raynaud
patients compared to normal but coffman and cohen (1994)
failed to find changes in plasma 5-ht during reflex stimulation

associated with body cooling in normal or raynaud patients,
despite finding associated decreases in blood flow and increases
in vascular resistance. 5-ht seems to facilitate more platelet
aggregation in raynaud patients than in normal volunteers
(biondi & marasini, 1989). however, platelet aggregation is not
necessary because a patient with glanzmann's thromboasthenia, in which platelets cannot aggregate, exhibited typical
raynaud's phenomenon (bellucci et al., 1990). initial reports
suggested some involvement of 5-ht2a receptors in raynaud's
phenomenon because  xxxd2419xxx  relieved but did not prevent
cold-induced vasoconstriction in raynaud's phenomenon
(seibold & terregino, 1986). a hypothetical 5-ht-evoked
vasocontriction can be amplified by cooling and blocked by
 xxxd2419xxx  as found in animal vascular models (van nueten &
janssens, 1986). furthermore, in line with raynaud's hypothesis, alpha-adrenoceptor blockers are effective in the treatment of
raynaud's phenomenon (wigley, 2002) and perhaps traces of
5-ht could amplify through  xxxd2419xxx -sensitive receptors the
vasoconstrictor response to noradrenaline, as also observed in
animal models (van nueten et al., 1988). however, a metaanalysis of  xxxd2419xxx  results has challenged the usefulness of
 xxxd2419xxx  (pope et al., 2000). on the other hand, another 5ht2a-selective antagonist, sarpogrelate appeared to reduce the
frequency and duration of raynaud episodes (kato et al., 2000).
the 5-ht uptake inhibitor fluoxetine appears to reduce attack
frequency and severity of the raynaud phenomenon, conceivably related to a reduction of the 5-ht content in platelets
(coleiro et al., 2001). emotional stress can also trigger raynaud
episodes (block & sequeira, 2001) so that improvement of the
function of cns 5-ht receptors with fluoxetine could also be
involved in the therapy of raynaud's phenomenon. unfortunately the nature of vascular 5-ht receptors, possibly involved
in the participation of raynaud's digital vasoconstriction, is
elusive and even paradoxical. a recent case of painful
discoloration of the fingers after exposure to cold in a young
woman (21 years old) taking the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor partial agonist
 xxxd3302xxx  was reported (bertoli et al., 2003). because  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors are located in human endothelial cells (ullmer et al.,
1995), an agonist would presumably increase cell ca2+ and
release  xxxd2738xxx  and cause vascular dilation, but not
constriction. however, it has recently been shown that
 xxxd3302xxx  is a high affinity antagonist of 5-ht2b receptors
(beattie et al., 2004), and since these receptors are located on
endothelial cells (ullmer et al., 1995) they could hypothetically
be involved in vasodilation through release of  xxxd2738xxx  as
seen in porcine pulmonary arteries (glusa & pertz, 2000). since
the origin of vascular 5-ht in raynaud's phenomenon is
obscure, one could speculate about the existence of a tonic
dilation of human digital blood vessels through occupied or
even unoccupied endothelial 5-ht2b receptors. clearly the role
of 5-ht and 5-ht receptor subtypes in raynaud's phenomenon
remains elusive and needs fresh research.
5.3.4. migraine
migraine is a cns disease with secondary cerebrovascular
changes, including vasodilation of meningeal arteries (hargreaves & shepheard, 1999) and extracranial arteries (lance,

1992). dilation of blood vessels causes pain and further nerve
activation of the trigeminal nerve (goadsby et al., 2002).
intracarotid administration of 5-ht decreases the amplitude of
the human temporal artery (lance, 1992), presumably through
both 5-ht1b and 5-ht2a receptors (verheggen et al., 1996,
1998, 2004), and sumatriptan constricts human meningeal
blood vessels (henkew et al., 1996) through 5-ht1b receptors
(hamel et al., 1993). sumatriptan also reverses the vasodilation
of the middle cerebral artery during migraine (friberg et al.,
1991), presumably through constriction mediated via 5-ht1b
receptors (hamel et al., 1993). although cranial vasoconstriction is a plausible mechanism by which sumatriptan (humphrey
et al., 1990) and other triptans alleviate migraine pain,
trigeminal neuronal inhibition appears also involved (goadsby
et al., 2002).
5-ht administered intravenously into volunteers causes
chest discomfort (le mesurier et al., 1959). tightness of chest is
observed in 3–5% of patients treated with sumatriptan (brown
et al., 1991; tansey et al., 1993), the  xxxd3263xxx  mostly used in
migraine. tightness of chest could be due to a variety of causes,
including coronary vasospasm, pulmonary vasoconstriction
and/or activation of sensory nerve endings (hillis & macintyre,
1993). on occasion, sumatriptan can produce  xxxd1914xxx  chest pain
and ischaemia (willett et al., 1992), associated with ventricular
fibrillation (curtin et al., 1992) and transmural infarction
(ottervanger et al., 1993, 1997), possibly due to coronary artery
constriction via 5-ht1b receptors. due to these occasional side
effects, the use of sumatriptan and other triptans is restricted in
cardiovascular disease. however, since these early reports there
has been a remarkably low incidence of serious cardiovascular
events in migraine patients treated with triptans, despite the
ability of all used triptans to cause some coronary artery
constriction (dodick et al., 2004).
5.3.5. portal hypertension and 5-ht2a receptors revisited
portal hypertension is a haemodynamic syndrome frequently
associated with cirrhosis of the liver. an often lethal
complication is haemorrhage from gastroesophageal varices.
the portal circulation is a low-pressure system (b10 mmhg)
formed by venous drainage from the gastrointestinal tract,
spleen, pancreas and gallbladder. veins collecting from these
organs form the splenic as well as superior and inferior
mesenteric veins which merge to form the portal vein (fig. 3).
portal hypertension is initiated by vascular obliteration caused
by an increased resistance to portal flow in the shrunken,
fibrotic liver. mesenchymal stellate cells in the subendothelial
space of disse undergo a transformation from a  xxxd3105xxx  rich
cell to a proliferating and fibrogenic cell type with reduced
 xxxd3105xxx  content. the vascular obliteration results not only
from obstruction to flow by extracellular matrix produced by the
transformed stellate cells, but also from sinusoidal contraction
caused by a change to a myoblast phenotype in cirrhosis
(friedman, 1993) (fig. 3). portal hypertension is established
when portal venous pressure exceeds the pressure of the inferior
vena cava by at least 5 mmhg and portosystemic collateral
vessels develop (fig. 3) in order to equalise pressures between
these 2 venous systems. the clinically most important

fig. 3. 5-ht2a receptors (red dots) in veins of the portal circulation (top panels) and stellate cells in the subendothelial space of the liver microcirculation in normal
liver (left panels) and cirrhotic liver (right panels). the drawing was adapted from friedman (1993).

collaterals are the oesophageal varices. because pressure is a
function of both resistance and flow, increases in flow due to
hyperdynamic circulation of cirrhosis and mesenteric arteriolar
vasodilation also contribute to portal pressure elevation
(groszmann, 1994).
there is evidence from animal models showing the existence
of 5-ht receptors in the portal vascular system (fig. 3) whose
function is changed by experimental portal hypertension. 5-ht
induces contractions in isolated inferior and superior mesenteric
veins of the rat, antagonised by nanomolar concentrations of
 xxxd2419xxx , and therefore mediated through 5-ht2a receptors
(cummings et al., 1986). 5-ht also contracts portal veins of
mice (silva et al., 1998) and rats (jacob et al., 1991). in both
oesophageal and mesenteric superior veins of the rabbit,
precontracted in 60 mm k+, 5-ht caused relaxations through
unknown 5-ht receptors (jensen et al., 1987). 5-ht causes
contractions and increases the expression of  xxxg2269xxx ,
involved in matrix formation by stellate cells; the effects are
antagonised by  xxxd2419xxx  and therefore mediated through 5ht2a receptors, consistent with 5-ht2a mrna expression (li
et al., 2003). the change to a myocyte phenotype in cirrhosis
suggests that these cells may also participate in vascular
constriction through 5-ht2a receptors.
5-ht receptor function is altered in experimental portal
hypertension. the sensitivity to 5-ht of rat mesenteric veins,
but not the affinity of  xxxd2419xxx  for 5-ht2a receptors, is
increased in portal hypertension (cummings et al., 1986). the
contractile responses to 5-ht of the portal vein from mice
infested with schistosoma mansoni were also increased
compared to non-infested mice (silva et al., 1998). oesophageal
collateral veins lose the ability to relax with 5-ht in portal

hypertensive rabbits (jensen et al., 1987). 5-ht contracts the
collateral vascular bed in a rat model of portal hypertension;
these effects are antagonised by nanomolar concentration of 5ht2a-selective antagonist ici169369 (mosca et al., 1992).
these in vitro changes of 5-ht function in experimental portal
hypertension were important because the 5-ht2a-selective
 xxxd2419xxx  also lowered portal pressure (cummings et al.,
1986).
following the initial work of cummings et al. (1986) with
 xxxd2419xxx , the blockade of 5-ht2a receptors as a mechanism to
lower portal pressure was confirmed with the 5-ht2a-selective
antagonists ici169369 (kaumann et al., 1988), ritanserin
(mastai et al., 1990; nevens et al., 1991; fernandez et al.,
1993) and the  xxxd2419xxx  analogue at-112 (lin et al., 1997) in
rats and with ritanserin in conscious, unrestrained cirrhotic dogs
(mastai et al., 1989).
the work of cummings et al. (1986) also prompted the
clinical use of 5-ht2a antagonists in human portal hypertension. intravenous  xxxd2419xxx  lowered portal pressure and
reduced azygos flow, reflecting superior portosystemic collateral blood flow, in cirrhotic patients (hadengue et al., 1987).
hadengue et al. (1989) showed that the beneficial effects of
 xxxd2419xxx  and propranolol on splanchnic circulation were
additive. vorobioff et al. (1989) also observed that  xxxd2419xxx ,
administered orally, reduced portal pressure in cirrhotics during
prolonged treatment, but reported that some patients underwent
a reversible portosystemic encephalopathy. high  xxxd2419xxx 
concentrations not only block 5-ht2a receptors but also block
alpha1-adrenoceptors (fozard, 1982) thereby lowering blood
pressure (reimann & frolich, 1983). however, vorobioff et
al. (1989) found no correlation between reductions in portal

696

a.j. kaumann, f.o. levy / pharmacology & therapeutics 111 (2006) 674–706

pressure and mean arterial pressure in their study on cirrhotic
patients. ritanserin, that blocks 5-ht2a receptors at nanomolar
concentrations but does not block alpha1-adrenoceptors, also
reduces portal pressure in cirrhotic patients (huet et al.,
1987). in portal-hypertensive rats with long-term bile duct
ligation infusion of ritanserin reduces portal pressure without
systemic haemodynamic changes (fernandez et al., 1993).
while  xxxd2419xxx  significantly lowers portal pressure in
portal hypertensive rats, alpha1-adrenoceptor selective  xxxd3000xxx 
only does so marginally, while both drugs caused a matching
decrease in blood pressure; these results are consistent with
 xxxd2419xxx  acting mainly through  xxxg1113xxx  blockade
(cummings et al., 1988). the reversible portosystemic
encephalopathy observed with prolonged  xxxd2419xxx  treatment
in some cirrhotics by vorobioff et al. (1989) could be related to
the hypotensive effects of  xxxd2419xxx .
the reviewed experimental and clinical evidence is consistent with a role of 5-ht2a receptors in portal hypertension. 5ht, formed in the enterochromaffin cells of the gut, is secreted
into the portal venous circulation and can cause vasoconstriction through 5-ht2a receptors located at (fig. 3): (i) mesenteric
veins, (ii) oesophageal collaterals and (iii) hepatic stellate cells.
in addition, it is also possible that 5-ht normally has a relaxant
effect on oesophageal veins and mesenteric veins, as observed
in the rabbit, where the effect is abolished in oesophageal
varices and mesenteric veins from portal hypertensive rabbits
(jensen et al., 1987). the nature of the 5-ht receptors that
mediate relaxation is unknown, but it is possible that they act
through release of  xxxd2738xxx  from endothelial cells because
there is a defect in both no release and no-mediated dilation of
the portal vascular tree in portal hypertension (groszmann &
abraldes, 2005). endothelial 5-ht receptors that could cause
release of no could be 5-ht2b (ullmer et al., 1995) and the
nature of the 5-ht receptors that possibly mediate relaxation of
the portal venous system requires investigation. direct
information about the 5-ht receptors mediating both contractile
and possibly relaxant effects of 5-ht needs to be generated in
veins of the human portal system to understand the mechanism
of action of 5-ht2a blockers in human portal hypertension.
based on the short transit time between gut and liver (∼20 s)
(kotelanski et al., 1972), it has been argued that little platelet
uptake of 5-ht released from the gut occurs before the liver
(anderson et al., 1987). it is therefore likely that the extraplatelet 5-ht concentration is sufficiently high to activate 5-ht
receptors of the portal venous system. portal pressure in patients
with cirrhosis can increase after a meal (mccormick et al.,
1990) and the portal blood of fed dogs has more 5-ht than the
blood from starved dogs (black et al., 1959). blood and plasma
levels of 5-ht are altered in patients with cirrhosis. whole
blood 5-ht levels are lower (beaudry et al., 1994), presumably
because there is a storage (laffi et al., 1992) and uptake (ahtee
et al., 1981) defect in platelets from cirrhotic patients. however,
unconjugated 5-ht levels, which represent the active form of 5ht, are increased in patients with cirrhosis (beaudry et al.,
1994).
the comprehensive evidence for a role of 5-ht in portal
hypertension and the initial clinical benefit of treatment with

 xxxd2419xxx  have demonstrated a harmful participation of 5-ht2a
receptors in patients with cirrhosis. however, the treatment with
 xxxd2419xxx  has been currently put on hold due to the detrimental
side effects such as systemic hypotension and portosystemic
encephalopathy (vorobioff et al., 1989). there is scope for
treatment of portal hypertensive patients with another clinically
effective  xxxg1113xxx  blocker devoid of these side effects.
