abstract: the binding of  xxxd2092xxx , a dihydropyridine ca2+ antagonist, to calmodulin has been studied
by equilibrium dialysis and fluorescence techniques. analysis using the hill equation gives a hill coefficient
of 2. a plot of bound [ xxxd2092xxx ] vs. free [ f e l ~ d i p i n e gives
] ~ a b,,, of 1.9 mol/mol and a
of 22 pm.
two calmodulin antagonists,  xxxd3007xxx  and r2457 1, which have previously been shown to potentiate
the fluorescent enhancement observed when  xxxd2092xxx  binds to calmodulin [johnson, j. d. (1983) biochem.
biophys. res. commun. i 1 2, 7871, produce a reduction in hi11 coefficient to 0.7 and 1 .o, respectively, and
account for the observed potentiation of  xxxd2092xxx  binding. titrations of  xxxd2092xxx  with calmodulin in the
absence and presence of  xxxd3007xxx  and r24571 suggest that these drugs decrease the
of calmodulin
for  xxxd2092xxx  by 25-fold. thus, potentiating drugs ( xxxd3007xxx  and r24571) bind to either of the two
 xxxd2092xxx  binding sites and, through an allosteric mechanism, result in  xxxd2092xxx  binding to the remaining
site with greatly enhanced affinity. two types of potentiating drugs are observed.  xxxd3007xxx  exhibits
a hill coefficient of 0.8 whereas  xxxd2092xxx , r24571, and diltiazem exhibit hill coefficients of 2 in their
potentiation of  xxxd2092xxx  binding. titrations of  xxxd2092xxx  and calmodulin with ca2+ exhibit cooperativity
with a hill coefficient of 4. half-maximal binding occurs near pca 6.0. in the presence of r24571, the
calcium dependence of  xxxd2092xxx  binding is biphasic, now exhibiting a much higher affinity (pca 7.6)
component. a model is presented to explain the relationship of these various allosterically regulated
conformers of calmodulin and their interactions and activation with its target proteins.

c a l m o d u l i n is a ubiquitous  xxxg2038xxx  that
binds 4 mol of calcium/mol of protein and undergoes large
calcium-dependent changes in structure. these structural
changes form or expose hydrophobic binding sites on its surface
(laporte et al., 1980; tanaka & hidaka, 1980) where cal+thiswork was supported by grants from the national institutes of
health (rol-am33727), the muscular dystrophy association of america, and the american heart association (84-792) and a research
award from hassle pharmaceutical. j.d.j. is the recipient of a young
investigator award from the central ohio heart association.

modulin binds and activates as many as 30 different proteins
in a calcium-dependent manner [see klee et al. (1980) for
review]. certain drugs, including  xxxd3431xxx  (tfp),w-7,
and r24571, can bind to these sites with high to moderate
affinity and inhibit calmodulin's interaction and activation of
many of the proteins that it modulates. presently, it is uncertain how calmodulin can bind and selectively activate so
many different proteins with any degree of specificity.
several models have been proposed to explain how calmodulin might exhibit selectivity as a calcium-dependent modulator. for example, some target proteins appear to exhibit

different ko5 values for calmodulin (scharff, 1981). further,
the calmodulin species that activates the target may vary as
a function of [ca2+]. haiech et al. (1981) have provided
evidence for an ordered binding of calcium that might activate
cam for specific functions dependent upon the free ca2+ion
concentration. in addition, different proteins may interact with
different binding sites on calmodulin, allowing some degree
of selective activation. all of the above mechanisms may
contribute to the selectivity of cam in activating its various
target proteins.
previously, we have shown that the dihydropyridine calcium
antagonist  xxxd2092xxx  binds to calmodulin in a calcium-dependent manner and that this binding (fluorescence) can be
enhanced by the interaction of calmodulin antagonists at
distinct sites via allosteric mechanisms (johnson, 1983). we
have suggested that these allosteric interactions among the
drug/protein sites on calmodulin might provide a mechanism
for selectively directing calmodulin to specific target proteins.
in this model, endogenous regulators (chemicals, peptides,
or proteins) would bind to calmodulin and alter its conformation via these allosteric mechanisms. these various calmodulin conformers would have an altered protein binding site
that would now exhibit enhanced selectivity for activating
certain target proteins over others.
in an effort to more fully understand the mechanism of the
allosteric interactions among the drug binding sites on calmodulin, we have analyzed the binding to  xxxd2092xxx  to calmodulin in the presence and in the absence of its potentiating
drugs. we propose a model to explain how cooperativity
among calcium-dependent drug/protein binding sites may
work in concert with the cooperativity among the calcium
binding sites to produce distinct conformers of calmodulin for
selective activation of its target proteins.
experimental
procedures

equilibrium dialysis. buffer used was 10 mm mops,’ ph
7.0,2 mm egta, 3 mm  xxxg2125xxx ,, and 90 mm kc1 (buffer a).
[3h] xxxd2092xxx  of constant specific activity was added to the
solution (50 ml) outside the dialysis bag, which contained 3
ml of 1 pm calmodulin. specific activity was determined by
using a millimolar extinction coefficient at 370 nm of 6.4 in
95% ethanol.
fluorescence enhancements. fluorescence measurements
were carried out in buffer a with 0.2 pm calmodulin and 1
pm  xxxd2092xxx  and varying amounts of calmodulin antagonists.
for titrations with  xxxd2092xxx  (dissolved in ethanol), buffer a
was used with ethanol held fixed at 4%. for  xxxd2092xxx  titrations in the presence of  xxxd3007xxx  or r24571, the order
of addition was  xxxd2092xxx , calmodulin, and then r24571 or
 xxxd3007xxx . fluorescence measurements were carried out
as previously described (johnson, 1983), free [ca] was determined in egta-ca2+ buffer systems as previously described (johnson et al., 1978), and calmodulin concentrations
were determined by the  xxxd2444xxx  method. hill plots were analyzed by an iterative linear regression hill plot program, and
b,,, was determined by the best fit of the data to the hill
equation.

results
to determine whether the previously reported increase in
 xxxd2092xxx  fluorescence observed upon the addition of  xxxd3007xxx  to calmodulin- xxxd2092xxx  was due to enhanced  xxxd2092xxx  binding or increased quantum yield of bound  xxxd2092xxx ,
equilibrium dialysis was carried out at varying concentrations
of  xxxd2092xxx  in the absence or presence of 10 pm  xxxd3007xxx 
(pa). this concentration of pa has previously been shown
to produce optimal enhancement (johnson, 1983). a plot of
[)hifelodipine binding vs. the fluorescence difference between
inside and outside of the dialysis bag (figure 1) shows that
the quantum yield is enhanced 5.6-fold when 1 mol of  xxxd2092xxx  is bound per mole of calmodulin, both in the presence
and in the absence of  xxxd3007xxx . the increase in fluorescence produced by  xxxd3007xxx  is, therefore, due to enhanced
 xxxd2092xxx  binding. further, this curve shows the close correlation between  xxxd2092xxx  binding and its fluorescence enhancement in both the presence and the absence of potentiating
drug and was subsequently used to quantitate  xxxd2092xxx 
binding.
a scatchard plot of the fluorescent data obtained from
 xxxd2092xxx  titrations of calmodulin ( b vs. b / s 2 )gave a straight
line (indicating that the hill coefficient was 2) with a b,,,
of 1.9 mol/mol and a
of 22 f 4 pm ( r = 0.90) (figure
2a). scatchard analysis in the presence of 10 pm  xxxd3007xxx  showed a reduction of both ko5(ko5
= 4 pm) and b,,,
(b,,, = 0.8), whereas neither
or b,,, was altered appreciably by 2 pm r24571. figure 3 shows hill plots (b,,,
= 1.9) of calmodulin titrated with  xxxd2092xxx  alone and in the
presence of 2 pm r24571 or 10 pm  xxxd3007xxx , concentrations that optimally enhance  xxxd2092xxx -calmodulin
fluorescence. these hill plots show that the fluorescence
enhancement results from a reduction in the hill coefficient
from 2 to 1 for r24571 and from 2 to 0.6 for  xxxd3007xxx .
in an effort to determine the effects of  xxxd3007xxx  and
r24571 on the ko.5 of calmodulin for  xxxd2092xxx , we have
conducted titrations of  xxxd2092xxx  (fprenylamine or r2457 1)
with calmodulin. hill plots of these titrations are shown in
figure 4. hill coefficients of 1.1 and 1.o were obtained in
the presence of r2457 1 and  xxxd3007xxx , respectively, compared to 0.8 with  xxxd2092xxx  alone. the data indicate that both
 xxxd3007xxx  and r2457 1 decrease the apparent ko of calmodulin for  xxxd2092xxx  from 14 pm to 0.5 pm and 0.6 pm,
respectively. thus, the data from figures 3 and 4 indicate
that  xxxd3007xxx  and r24571 reduce the hill coefficient from
2 to 1 or less and enhance the affinity of calmodulin for fel-

scatchard analysis of  xxxd2092xxx  binding to calmodulin in
the presence of r24571 at various calcium concentrations. concentrations of 1 pm calmodulin and 2 pm r24571 were titrated with
 xxxd2092xxx  in 10 mm mops, 90 mm kcl, 2 mm egta, and 4%
ethanol with free calcium adjusted to pca 7.0 (a), 4.0 ( o ) , or 3.0
(0).
values were 10 pm ( r = 0.94), 12 pm (r = 0.98) and 12
pm (r = 0.97), respectively. the inset shows the fluorescence increase
produced when 0.5 pm calmodulin and 1 pm  xxxd2092xxx  at pca 7.0
are titrated with r24571. a hill plot of the integral showed
=
1 pm: hill coefficient = 2.0; r = 0.998.
figure 6:

give the expected s-shaped drug titration plots.  xxxd3007xxx 
is most similar to the theoretical two equivalent site model (hill
coefficient = 0.8), indicating that  xxxd2092xxx  binds with high
affinity to those calmodulin molecules containing one and only
one  xxxd3007xxx  but that  xxxd3007xxx  does not potentiate its
own binding. both diltiazem and r24571 are similar to what
one would expect for nonfluorescent analogues of  xxxd2092xxx 
and exhibit hill coefficients near 2.0. these latter drugs
potentiate .binding of both  xxxd2092xxx  and themselves to a
second allosterically regulated site.
therefore, there appear to be at least two classes of drugs
that bind to calmodulin. class 1: those drugs that potentiate
 xxxd2092xxx  binding to a second site but have similar affinities
for both sites themselves, exhibiting hill-coefficients of 1 or
less. class 2: drugs that exhibit positive cooperativity (hill
coefficient = 2) and potentiate binding of both themselves and
 xxxd2092xxx  to a second site.
our studies illustrate another major difference between pa
and r24571. althdugh pa, r24571, and diltiazem can each
potentiate  xxxd2092xxx  binding at pca 3.0, at much lower [caz+]
only r24571 is an effective potentiator. figure 6 (inset) shows
the effect of r2457 1 on calmodulin- xxxd2092xxx  fluorescence
at pca 7.0. at pca 7.0, the ko.5 of r24571 for cam- xxxd2092xxx  is estimated to be 1 pm, and it again enhances camfelodipine fluorescence with a hill coefficient of 2.0 ( r =
0.998). at pca 7.0 neither  xxxd3007xxx  (at 100 pm), diltiazem (at 500 pm), nor  xxxd2092xxx  itself ( xxxd1891xxx  pm) will
potentiate  xxxd2092xxx  binding to calmodulin. figure 6 shows
scatchard analysis of  xxxd2092xxx  titrations of calmodulin in the
presence of r24571 at pca 7.0,4.0, and 3.0. these data show
a reduction in b,,, at lower caz+concentrations. this is
consistent with a reduction in the number of active cam
molecules at lower [cazf]. no fluorescence enhancement was
noted at pca 7 with  xxxd2092xxx  alone or in the presence of 10
pm  xxxd3007xxx . figure 7 shows the calcium dependence of
the fluorescence increase produced by  xxxd2092xxx  binding to
calmodulin. this increase is half-maximal at pca 6.0 with
a hill coefficient of 4. the addition of 2 pm r24571 dramatically influences the calcium dependence of these
fluorescence changes. in the presence of r24571, the calcium
curve is clearly biphasic, and  xxxd2092xxx  binding is potentiated
by calcium binding to sites with
estimated to be pca 7.6
and pca 6.0. the presence of 10 pm pa has little effect on
calcium dependence of  xxxd2092xxx -calmodulin, but the hill

coefficient was reduced from 4 to 3. these data suggest that
at pca 7.0, r24571 but not 10 pm  xxxd3007xxx  can potentiate
 xxxd2092xxx  binding to calmodulin and that, in the presence of
 xxxd2092xxx , r2457 1 but not  xxxd3007xxx  can enhance the
calcium affinity of some of the calcium binding sites on cam.
discussion
previously, we have shown that calcium binding to cam
exposes hydrophobic binding site@) for  xxxd2092xxx  (johnson,
1983).  xxxd2092xxx  binding can be followed by the large increase in its fluorescence, which occurs concomitant with its
binding to cam. further, we have presented the first evidence
that some of the drug binding sites on cam are allosterically
related (johnson, 1983). some calmodulin antagonists,
r24571 and pa, could bind to cam at low concentrations and
enhance  xxxd2092xxx  binding and fluorescence while at high
concentrations they could apparently displace  xxxd2092xxx  and
decrease its fluorescence. in this study we have explored the
mechanism for allosteric drug effects on calmodulin- xxxd2092xxx 
fluorescence in a quantitative manner.
we find that cam has two binding sites for  xxxd2092xxx 
= 22 pm) and that these sites exhibit strong positive cooperativity (hill coefficient = 2.0). calmodulin antagonists
(cam ants), such as  xxxd3007xxx  and r24571, enhance
 xxxd2092xxx  binding by decreasing the hill coefficient for its
binding from 2.0 to 0.6 and 1.0, respectively. these nonfluorescent cam ants presumably bind to one of the two
 xxxd2092xxx  binding sites and potentiate  xxxd2092xxx  binding to
the remaining  xxxd2092xxx  binding site. our titrations of  xxxd2092xxx  with calmodulin in the presence of its potentiators
( xxxd3007xxx  and r24571) show that  xxxd2092xxx  now binds to
a single site whose dissociation constant has been reduced from
14 pm to 0.5 pm and 0.6 p m , respectively. thus,  xxxd3007xxx 
and r2457 1 enhance  xxxd2092xxx -calmodulin fluorescence by
binding to a single site on calmodulin and allosterically enhancing the affinity of  xxxd2092xxx  at a second binding site.
 xxxd2092xxx  binding and its potentiation by  xxxd3007xxx  and
r24571 are strictly dependent on calcium. under low ca2+
conditions (pca 10-7.0),  xxxd2092xxx  will not bind, and  xxxd3007xxx  (100 pm) will not potentiate its binding as it does at
pca 3.0 or 4. r24571, however, can potentiate  xxxd2092xxx 
binding even at pca 7.0. r24571 in the presence of  xxxd2092xxx 
produces an apparent increase (40-fold) in the affinity of some
of the calcium binding sites that regulate  xxxd2092xxx  binding
(figure 7). this suggests that  xxxd3007xxx  and r24571 ex-

mechanism.
a free-energy coupling model in which both ca2+,-cam
and ca2+4-cam have active conformations is the simplest
model to explain the observed results (see scheme i). in this
model  xxxd3007xxx  could bind the ca2+,-cam conformer
almost as well as to ca2+4-camconformer whereas diltiazem,
r24571, and  xxxd2092xxx  would have a greater preference for
the ca2+4-camconformer. when calmodulin and  xxxd2092xxx 
are titrated with ca2+ a hill coefficient of 4 is observed,
consistent with ca2+4-cam being the active species. ca2+
titrations of cam in the presence of both  xxxd2092xxx  and
 xxxd3007xxx  exhibit hill coefficients of 3 or less, consistent
with  xxxd3007xxx  binding to ca2+,-cam (le., for  xxxd3007xxx ,

hibit some fundamental differences in their binding and that
only r24571 can enhance calcium binding to cam such that
 xxxd2092xxx  will bind at pca 7.0. the potentiation of  xxxd2092xxx 
binding at pca 7.0 by r24571 may be due to its high affinity
for calmodulin or may reflect some selectivity in its binding.
johnson & wittenauer (1983) have reported at
of 2-3
nm for r24571 and dansylated calmodulin. therefore, of the
drugs tested, only r2457 1 can bind to calmodulin with high
enough affinity to pull the reaction toward the cam-ca2+r24571 state at low ca2+. r24571 is apparently unique
among the drugs tested in that at low concentrations it can
increase the affinity of cam for calcium so that ca2+-dependent  xxxd2092xxx  binding can occur even at pca 7.0.
in the following model (see scheme i) we account for the
ca2+-dependent allosteric interactions among  xxxd3007xxx ,
r2457 1, and  xxxd2092xxx  binding sites. kuo (1983) has shown
that, in the monod-wyman-changeaux (monod et al., 1965)
model, cooperative ligands could be both activators and inhibitors. the sigmoidal curve (hill coefficient = 2.0) of a
cooperative ligand shifts to a hyperbolic curve (hill coefficient
= 1.o) with enhanced binding at low ligand concentration in
the presence of a second cooperative ligand. this is analogous
to what we observe with r24571 and  xxxd3007xxx , respectively,
in their enhancement of  xxxd2092xxx  binding. noncooperative
ligands cannot, by this model, produce enhancement.
therefore, enhancement of  xxxd2092xxx  binding implies cooperative binding. the apparent negative cooperativity of  xxxd3007xxx  cannot be explained by a simple two-state ca2+4cam model. this apparent negative cooperativity can best
be explained by  xxxd3007xxx 's ability to bind\to an active
ca2+&am conformer, which is in equilibrium with an active
ca2+,-cam conformer (scheme i). this would keep the
concentration of the ca2+&am conformer relatively constant
and produce apparent negative cooperativity (hill coefficient
= 0.6) when cam was titrated with  xxxd2092xxx  in the presence
of  xxxd3007xxx . this two active conformer model could also
explain the broad curve observed when cam- xxxd2092xxx  is

this is analogous to the hill equation, and
from the hill
plot = l,'/~k,.
the maximum value for k , is similar to the 0.5 pm value
determined from a titration of  xxxd2092xxx  with calmodulin in
the presence of r24571 or  xxxd3007xxx  (figure 3). the
minimum value for la then is 1700 (ag = 5 kcal/mol). the
hill plot is a reasonable approximation for s / k , > 10 or for
s>5pm.
at low ca2+concentration,the ca2+,-cam-r2457 1 species
may predominate over caze4-cam-r2457 1 producing apparent noncompetitive inhibition at low calcium concentrations
(b,,, is reduced from 1.8 to 0.8 mol/mol); an analogous
situation is seen with  xxxd3007xxx  at pca 3 (figure 2b). this
could account for the biphasic ca2+titration curve seen in the
presence of r24571 (figure 7). the first phase of the
fluorescence increase probably represents ca2+-inducedformation of the conformer ca2+,-cam with two drugs (d2).
the final increase probably represents the addition of calcium
to this species to form ca2+4-cam with two drugs. the
biphasic increases in fluorescence intensity observed in this
ca2+ titration would represent sequential increases in drug
affinity or free energy of the system as shown in scheme i.
this model is consistent with the observation of keller et
al. (1982), who observed that tfp enhanced the binding of
the first three ca2+but inhibited binding of the fourth, possibly
indicative of preferential binding to ca2+3-cam. ans, on
the other hand, increased the cooperativity of ca2+ binding
to all four ca2+ sites.
the model we propose for ca2+-dependentbinding of drugs
is similar to those proposed for calmodulin binding to its target
proteins. in addition, our model accounts for the cooperative
binding among drug/protein binding sites exposed on different
ca2+conformers. in a review of the calcium dependence of
calmodulin's activation of various proteins, cox (1 984) has
shown that ca2+,-cam and/or ca2+4-cam are the active
species. ca2+,-cam is apparently the active species for activating the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase of cardiac
sarcoplasmic reticulum (pifl et al., 1984), and its activation
by ca2+displays a hill coefficient of 4. for phosphorylase
kinase, however, ca2+,-cam is the active species (burger et
al., 1983), with both the tightly bound and loosely bound
calmodulin molecules binding three ca2+ in the active state,
with each exhibiting distinct ca2+ titration curves. this is
consistent with our model's two conformational states for
ca2+,-cam, each of which should exhibit distinct ca2+ti-

4902 b i oc h e m i s t r y
tration curves. these studies of cam-protein interaction are
analogous to our finding that ca2+3-cam and ca2+4-cam
are the active species for drug binding. if this is true, then
cam-ant drugs might be expected to mimic the effects we
observe on  xxxd2092xxx  binding. metzger et al. (1982) have
shown that  xxxd3007xxx  is able to enhance and then inhibit
the velocity of contraction of skinned smooth muscle. maximal
potentiation is observed  xxxd1891xxx  pm  xxxd3007xxx , while higher
 xxxd3007xxx  concentrations produce inhibition. the contraction of chemically skinned smooth muscle is dependent on
the calmodulin-dependentinteraction and activation of myosin
light chain kinase ( xxxg1491xxx ). this suggests that  xxxd3007xxx 
is able to regulate the binding of  xxxg1491xxx  to calmodulin in a
manner analogous to its allosteric regulation of  xxxd2092xxx 
binding.
further, our studies indicate that some cam ant's
(r24571)can dramatically enhance the apparent affinity of
cam for ca2+. similarly, it has been shown that troponin i
(keller et al., 1982),  xxxg1491xxx  (olwin et al., 1984), and melittin
(maulett & cox, 1983) binding to calmodulin enhances its
ca2+ affinity. in this respect also, drug binding seems
analogous to protein binding. our allosteric model suggests
that various drugs may inhibit (or stimulate) calmodulinprotein interactions differentially. consistent with this, hidaka
et al. (1980)have shown that  xxxd3007xxx  inhibits in the order
pde > ca2+ xxxd2531xxx atpase>  xxxg1491xxx  whereas w-7 inhibits
in the order ca2+ xxxd2531xxx atpase>  xxxg1491xxx  > pde, indicating
that various drugs can show some selectivity in inhibiting
various targets. moreover, his data also showed very little
correlation between inhibition of [3h]w - 7binding and enzyme
inhibition, indicating that simple competition cannot account
for the observed inhibition of enzymes. this and our data
clearly suggest that stricter analysis of drug inhibition data
is necessary to determine if some of the cam-ants drugs may
allosterically or competitively affect various cam-protein
interactions.
our finding of two binding sites for  xxxd2092xxx  is in agreement with jarret (1984),who labeled calmodulin with the
affinity reagent lo-(3-aminopropyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenothiazine and found that 2 mol of reagent was covalently
coupled per mole of calmodulin. newton et al. (1983)showed
that only 1 mol of 2-chloro-l0-(3-isothiocyanatopropyl)phenothiazine was incorporated into calmodulin but that the
modified calmodulin was able to bind to cyclic nucleotide
phosphodiesterase and inhibit its activation by unmodified
calmodulin. they also observed increased rates of incorporation of affinity label when tfp was added at low concentrations, consistent with our observation of allosteric interaction
among calmodulin's drug binding sites. affinity labels should
be useful in determining the effects of drug binding on ca2+
affinity without the interference of multiple equilibria, as well
as for determination of k,, the dissociation constant of the
activated state for various drugs.
finally, the model proposed here has much in common with
what is known for hemoglobins (perutz, 1978). the effect of
 xxxd3007xxx  and r24571 on  xxxd2092xxx  binding is similar to
known effects of co on hemoglobin where co enhances
hemoglobin affinity for o2 at low oxygen concentrations and
displaces it at high oxygen concentrations (rodkey et al.,

mills, bailey, a n d johnson

1974). if drug (or protein) binding can liberate a proton from
calmodulin similarly to that which occurs when o2 binds to
hemoglobin, this might explain how ca2+affinity is increased
when drugs or proteins bind to calmodulin. also, there might
be naturally occurring allosteric regulators of calmodulin,
analogous to those known for hemoglobin, which may alter
its sensitivity to ca2+and/or impart selectivity for calmodulin
binding to its target proteins.
