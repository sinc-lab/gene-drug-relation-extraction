introduction
since their introduction into clinical practice just 150
years ago, general anaesthetics have become some of
the most widely used and important therapeutic agents.
however, despite over a century of research, the molecular mechanisms of action for general anaesthetics in
the central nervous system (cns) remain elusive. as a
result of research during the last several decades, the
ligand-gated ion channels have emerged as promising
molecular targets to mediate the cns effects of general
anaesthetics. in this review, we aim to describe the
actions of general anaesthetics on mammalian neurotransmitter-gated ion channels.

we will begin by summarizing the history of general
anaesthesia and the chemical classes of general anaesthetics and then provide background on the physiology
and pharmacology of ligand-gated ion channels. we
will brieﬂy look at experimental methodology and review the pharmacological criteria which can help deﬁne
which proteins represent plausible molecular targets for
general anaesthetics. we will then describe the actions
of general anaesthetics on the ligand-gated ion channels. the last 10 years have witnessed an explosion of
studies of anaesthetic modulation of ligand-gated ion
channels, and we will focus in particular on recent
studies which utilize recombinant chimeric and mutated
receptors to identify regions of ligand-gated ion channels important for the modulatory actions of general

anaesthetics. lastly, we will discuss future directions in
this area of research.

what is a general anaesthetic?
general anaesthetics include a startling range of structurally diverse molecules that can be roughly, and somewhat arbitrarily, divided into volatile anaesthetics,
anaesthetic gases, alcohols and intravenous anaesthetics
(ﬁg. 1). a surprisingly elusive question is what deﬁnes a
general anaesthetic, since anaesthesia is a behavioral
state easily recognized but difﬁcult to describe precisely.
depending on the clinical procedure, effective anaesthesia requires varying degrees of immobility, amnesia,
unconsciousness/hypnosis, analgesia, muscle relaxation
and depression of autonomic reﬂexes [1]. no general
anaesthetic provides all of these effects, although immobility, unconsciousness/hypnosis and amnesia are behavioral hallmarks of most general anaesthetics [2].
modern anaesthesia involves not only general anaesthetics but also the use of multiple supplemental agents
including analgesics (e.g. opiates) and neuromuscular
blockers.

speciﬁc versus nonspeciﬁc mechanisms of anaesthetic
action
the observation that a spectrum of chemically dissimilar agents produce general anaesthesia greatly inﬂuenced the thinking of early investigators seeking to
explain anaesthetic mechanisms of action. a landmark
series of experiments reported independently by hans
meyer and charles ernest overton around the turn of
the century determined that the potencies of general
anaesthetic molecules correlated well with their water/
oil partition coefﬁcients [3–5]. the so-called meyeroverton correlation was later extended to embrace the
concept that certain molecules produce general anaesthesia by a nonspeciﬁc mechanism. the traditional view
since the time of meyer and overton has been that
general anaesthetics exert their primary effects by dissolving in cell membranes, particularly in the cns
[6–8]. the presence of general anaesthetic molecules is
thought to perturb the structural and dynamic properties of the lipid bilayer (a ‘nonspeciﬁc’ action), so that
the function of crucial but unspeciﬁed membrane
proteins is affected. ‘speciﬁc’ actions of anaesthetics
generally refer to direct effects of general anaesthetics

on known protein molecules which result in reversible
alterations in the function of the protein (e.g. increased
probability of opening of an ion channel) [9].
research within the last several decades has demonstrated numerous inconsistencies between experimental
observations and nonspeciﬁc theories of general anaesthesia [9–12]. the main problems include the following
[1, 13]: (i) some chemical compounds are predicted by
nonspeciﬁc theories to be anaesthetics but, in fact, do not
produce anaesthesia; (ii) nonspeciﬁc theories of anaesthesia cannot account for the stereoselectivity demonstrated
by some anaesthetic isomers; and (iii) anaesthetic effects
on lipids (such as alterations in membrane bilayer ﬂuidity), when measured experimentally, are often negligible
at clinically relevant concentrations, and are easily reproduced by very small increases in ambient temperature. in
contrast, decreases in body temperature mimic the behavioral effects of general anaesthetics [13–15]. despite the
numerous inconsistencies between the experimental evidence and nonspeciﬁc theories of anaesthesia, there have
been attempts in the last decade to present modiﬁed
nonspeciﬁc theories. the interested reader is best referred
to some of the more recent experimental investigations
and review articles in this area [16–21]. some prescient
investigators recognized a number of decades ago that
anaesthetics may act instead on speciﬁc targets. for
example, sir john eccles and colleagues studied spinal
synaptic reﬂexes in animals under pentobarbitone anaesthesia [22, 23] and raised the possibility of anaesthetic
actions at neurotransmitter receptors important in synaptic transmission.

ligand-gated ion channels
this review summarizes recent progress in the understanding of general anaesthetic actions on receptor
proteins important in synaptic transmission in the cns.
a number of excellent reviews over the last decade have
summarized work on the actions of general anaesthetics
on receptor proteins in the cns [1, 13, 24–37]. we aim
here to expand and update these prior reviews, with
particular reference to recent studies documenting general anaesthetic actions on recombinant ligand-gated ion
channels. ligand-gated ion channels are certainly not the
only possible molecular targets for general anaesthetics;
other neuronal proteins such as voltage-gated ion channels and g-protein-coupled receptors may also play a
role in the overall behavioral spectrum of action of
general anaesthetics. however, extensive research has
arrived at an almost universal consensus; voltage-gated
ion channels are, in general, relatively insensitive to
clinically relevant concentrations of general anaesthetics
[13]. detailed studies of general anaesthetic actions on
g-protein-coupled receptors are scarce, and it can be

general anaesthetic actions on ligand-gated ion channels

difﬁcult to distinguish effects on the receptor per se versus
general anaesthetic perturbations of second messengers
or effector molecules such as protein kinases and phospholipases.
the ligand-gated ion channels have emerged as strong
candidates as molecular mediators of the cns effects of
general anaesthetics [13, 26, 27]. the ligand-gated ion
channels include the gamma  xxxd2177xxx  type a
(gabaa), glycine, serotonin-3 (5-ht3) and nicotinic
acetylcholine (ach) receptors, along with the alphaamino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole  xxxd3029xxx 
(ampa)-, kainate- and nmda-sensitive subtypes of
ionotropic glutamate receptors (note: gamma  xxxd2177xxx  (gaba), glutamate, 5-ht and ach also act
on ‘slow’ neurotransmitter receptors, e.g. gabab, muscarinic acetylcholine and metabotropic glutamate receptors, which are coupled to second messenger systems).
gabaa, glycine, 5-ht3 and nicotinic ach receptors
form part of an evolutionarily related ligand-gated ion
channel gene superfamily [38]. ionotropic glutamate
receptors were originally thought to be part of this
superfamily but are now thought to belong to a distinct
ion channel class (see below). all members of the ligandgated ion channel superfamily appear to have the basic
subunit topology diagrammed in ﬁgure 2, with a large
n-terminal extracellular domain, four putative membrane-spanning regions (tm1–tm4), a heterogeneous
intracellular loop between  xxxg2318xxx  and tm4, and a short
extracellular c-terminal domain. residues within the
extracellular n-terminal domain form the agonist binding domains [39–41], whereas amino acid residues within
tm2 line the ion channel pore [42, 43] (see ﬁgs 2 and 3).
native receptors are composed of pentameric arrangements of individual receptor subunits [44, 45] (see ﬁg. 2).
gabaa and glycine receptors
gabaa and glycine receptors are chloride-selective ion
channels. these are generally considered to be inhibitory
neurotransmitter receptors, since in most cells, opening
of chloride channels results in membrane hyperpolarization and/or stabilization of the membrane potential away
from the threshold for ﬁring action potentials [46].
gaba and glycine are the primary fast inhibitory neurotransmitters in the cns, with glycine abundant in the
spinal cord and brainstem [40, 47] and gaba predominant in higher brain regions [46]. it has been estimated
that one-third of all synapses in the cns are gaba-ergic
[48].
subunit heterogeneity creates extensive diversity among
the inhibitory ligand-gated ion channels. multiple subunits have been cloned for gabaa (h1 – 6, i1 – 4, k1 – 4, l,
m and y) [49–56] and glycine (h1 – 4, i) [40, 47, 57, 58]
receptors. gabaa receptors in vivo predominantly
consist of h, i and k subunits with a proposed stoichiometry of 2h: 2i: 1k [59, 60] (see ﬁg. 2). the exis-

the retina but are also found in other areas of the brain
[73]. the designation of ‘gabac’ for z subunits, while
potentially confusing [56], follows from their extensive
pharmacological differences from gabaa receptors,
including insensitivity to the classical gabaa competitive antagonist bicuculline [70–72].

superfamily (nicotinic ach, gabaa, gabac z, glycine and
5-ht3 receptors). basic features of ligand-gated ion channel subunit topology (top panel) include an extensive extracellular n-terminal domain which binds the endogenous agonist, four putative
transmembrane domains, a diverse intracellular linker between
 xxxg2318xxx  and tm4, and a short extracellular c-terminal domain.
other features not illustrated include critical disulﬁde linkages for
some receptor subunits in the n-terminal extracellular domain
and consensus phosphorylation sites for some subunits in the
 xxxg2318xxx –tm4 intracellular linker. the bottom panel depicts a schematic top view of a gabaa hik receptor complex. for all
ligand-gated ion channels, tm2 from each subunit (yellow) is
thought to line the central ion channel pore.

nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
nicotinic ach receptors may be divided into two main
groups: the ‘muscle’ subtype expressed in skeletal muscle
[74, 75] and in the electroplaque of torpedo [76], and
‘neuronal’ nicotinic ach receptors found throughout the
cns and at autonomic ganglia [41, 77–79]. these receptors contain a nonselective cation channel. multiple
subunit isoforms have been described for muscle (h1, i,
k, l, m) and neuronal (h2 – 9, i2 – 4) nicotinic ach receptors
[41, 75, 79, 80]. the muscle nicotinic ach receptors
mediate synaptic excitation at the neuromuscular junction [74, 75]. the physiological roles of neuronal nicotinic ach receptors are currently an area of intense
inquiry. these receptors seem likely to participate in
nicotine addiction, and may perhaps be involved in
neurological and psychiatric disorders, in addition to
their more traditional role in the function of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems [41, 77–79].
neuronal nicotinic ach receptors occur at both pre- and
postsynaptic loci in the cns. presynaptic nicotinic ach
receptors modulate the release of neurotransmitters such
as gaba, 5-ht, dopamine, norepinephrine, glutamate
and ach [81]. the existence of postsynaptic neuronal
nicotinic ach receptors at sympathetic ganglia has been
known for many decades [79]; more recent research has
also demonstrated functional postsynaptic neuronal
nicotinic ach receptors in the cns [82].

tence of six h-subunit isoforms enables considerable
anatomical and functional diversity of gabaa receptors
[61–63]. in particular, the h-subunit isoform may inﬂuence agonist potency [64, 65], agonist efﬁcacy [66], regulation by benzodiazepines [67] and channel kinetics [68,
69]. the most common neuronal subunit combination is
h1i2k2 [52, 56]. gabaa receptors are blocked competitively by bicuculline and noncompetitively by picrotoxinin and zn2 + [39] (see ﬁg. 3).
strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors in vivo consist of
both h homomers and hi heteromers, with a switch from
homomeric to heteromeric receptors occurring during
development [40, 57, 58]. the best-described role for
glycine receptors is in renshaw cell inhibition of motor
neurones in the spinal cord; however, glycine receptors
are also widely expressed in the brainstem and throughout higher regions of the neuraxis [57, 58].
gabac receptors are formed from z subunits (z1 – 3)
[70–72]. gabac receptors show greatest expression in

5-ht3 receptors
5-ht3 receptors are ligand-gated cation channels that
are expressed in a number of central and peripheral
nervous system areas, including the hippocampus, brainstem, dorsal root ganglia (cell bodies of sensory neurones) and vagal axons [83]. 5-ht3 receptors are
expressed efﬁciently as homomers in heterologous expression systems such as xenopus oocytes, but there is
evidence that 5-ht3 receptors in vivo may be heteromeric, indicating that additional subunits or splice
variants have yet to be characterized [84]. the most
unambiguous physiological role for 5-ht3 receptors in
humans is in the medullary circuitry subserving the
vomiting reﬂex, which is consistent with robust expression of the  xxxg1116xxx  in the nucleus tractus solitarius and area postrema [83, 85].  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonists such as ondansetron are used clinically to
prevent nausea and vomiting [86]. activation of 5-ht3
receptors also modulates extracellular dopamine levels in

1282

m. d. krasowski and n. l. harrison

the nucleus accumbens, and this may be involved in the
rewarding properties of certain drugs of abuse [87]. 5-ht3
receptors may also play a role in nociception [85]; for
example, some nociceptive primary afferents express
5-ht3 receptors, and activation of these receptors facilitates the response of some dorsal horn neurones to
noxious stimuli [88].

ionotropic glutamate receptors
the ionotropic glutamate receptors consist of the
ampa-, nmda- and kainate-sensitive subtypes. glutamate receptors were originally assumed to have a membrane topology and pentameric structure similar to that

general anaesthetic actions on ligand-gated ion channels

proposed for the original ligand-gated ion channel superfamily. more recent work suggests instead  xxxg220xxx 
topology that includes a reentrant loop forming the ion
channel pore [89–92] analogous to the reentrant pore loop
associated with the s5–s6 ‘signature sequence’ of the
voltage-gated potassium channels [93]. tetrameric structures have been proposed for ampa [94] and nmda
receptor [95] complexes. once again, the proposed tetrameric structure is much more similar to the voltagegated potassium channels [96] than to the members of the
ligand-gated ion channel gene superfamily discussed
above.
nmda receptors (nr1,  xxxg964xxx -2d,  xxxg968xxx ) [97–100] are
ligand-gated cation channels with several unusual

figure 3. location of amino acid residues within tm2 and  xxxg2318xxx  of (a) human gabaa h1 [280] and (b) human gabaa i2 [281]
receptor subunits that are critical for general anaesthetic modulation or block by the noncompetitive antagonists picrotoxinin and
zn2 + , in addition to amino acid residues which are thought to line the ion channel pore. gabaa h1 and i2 subunit isoforms are chosen
since they represent the most common neuronal h and i subunit isoforms [52, 56]. the residue positions are from published studies:
channel-lining residues [42, 282], volatile ethers (enﬂurane [219] and isoﬂurane [206, 219]), n-alcohols [219], picrotoxinin [283], propofol
[206], trichloroethanol [227], etomidate [228, 229], loreclezole [284], barbiturate (pentobarbitone) [261] and zinc ions [285]. note that
some of the residue positions highlighted were actually ﬁrst described in h- or i-subunit isoforms different from h1 or i2. to date,
detailed three-dimensional structural information about tm2, the tm2– xxxg2318xxx  linker, and  xxxg2318xxx  is lacking, so that the ordering of
residues is hypothetical only. for example, the spatial interrelationship between tm2 and  xxxg2318xxx  in a functional gabaa receptor
complex is currently unknown.

features including, most notably, high ca2 + permeability
[101] and strong voltage-dependent block by mg2 + ions
[102–104]. nmda receptors have attracted a great deal
of attention due to their involvement in the induction of
long-term potentiation in the ca1 subﬁeld of the
hippocampus and other areas of the cerebral cortex
[105–107]. nmda receptors are proposed to be involved
in learning and memory [108, 109]. nmda receptors are
also implicated in certain forms of neurotoxicity and in
the etiology of several neurodegenerative disorders [110–
113]. the pharmacology of the nmda receptors has been
extensively characterized, and a number of substances
modify nmda receptor function, including the coagonist glycine [114, 115], polyamines [116, 117], zn2 + [118,
119], protons [120, 121],  xxxd2154xxx  [122, 123] and
oxidizing/reducing agents [124].
ampa receptors, represented in neurones by combinations of the gene products  xxxg952xxx –4, appear to serve as
the major fast excitatory neurotransmitter receptors at
most synapses in the cns [113, 125]. synaptic ampa
receptors respond to glutamate quickly and transiently,
due to diffusion and rapid removal of glutamate from the
synaptic cleft, in addition to fast receptor desensitization
[126]. ampa receptors are therefore ideally suited for
their role in excitatory transmission on a millisecond
timescale. the physiological roles of kainate glutamate
receptors ( xxxg958xxx –7,  xxxg961xxx ,  xxxg959xxx ) are less clear at present,
even though kainate receptors are widely distributed
throughout the brain and spinal cord. recent work
provides strong evidence for the synaptic activation of
kainate receptors at both pre- and postsynaptic sites [127,
128]. the study of ampa and kainate receptors in the
cns was hampered for a long time by a lack of selective
antagonists. recent development of selective ampa
receptor antagonists has remedied this problem to some
extent [128, 129]. an experimental obstacle to study of
some of the kainate and ampa receptors is desensitization on the millisecond to submillisecond timescale [130–
132]. this complicates the interpretation of many studies,
for example those employing heterologous expression of
kainate and ampa receptors in xenopus oocytes, in
which agonist may be applied for seconds to minutes.

pharmacological criteria that a candidate receptor must
meet to be considered as a reasonable general
anaesthetic target
before discussing the actions of speciﬁc agents on ligandgated ion channels, it is worthwhile to deﬁne speciﬁc
criteria that an anaesthetic target (receptor protein or
otherwise) must fulﬁll in order to qualify as a candidate
in mediating the behavioral actions of the general anaesthetics [1, 13].

review article

1283

1) the general anaesthetic must alter the function of the
receptor at clinically relevant concentrations.
2) the receptor must be expressed in the appropriate
anatomical locations to mediate the speciﬁc behavioral
effects of the anaesthetic.
3) if an anaesthetic molecule shows stereoselective effects
in vivo, these should be mirrored by the in vitro actions
at the receptor.
4) the hydrophobicity of a compound within a homologous series of anaesthetics should correlate with the in vivo
anaesthetic potency and that at the target receptor.
the general anaesthetic must alter the function of the
receptor at clinically relevant concentrations. what is the
‘clinically relevant concentration’ for a general anaesthetic? for an inhaled anaesthetic such as isoﬂurane, 1
minimum alveolar concentration (mac) conventionally
refers to the concentration of inhaled anaesthetic that
produces immobility in 50% of animals studied [133, 134].
immobility, a lack of purposeful response to a noxious
stimulus, represents an easily determined endpoint across
a large variety of different animal species. the use of
immobility as an experimental endpoint is helpful in that,
for most general anaesthetics, anaesthetic concentrations
two- to fourfold above the ec50 (concentration of a
compound which produces 50% of the maximal effect) for
producing immobility are invariably lethal [13]. the
anaesthetic concentrations that produce signiﬁcant inhibition of cognitive functions and cortical activity, assessed
using eeg-derived indicators, are lower than those
required for producing immobility [135–137]. thus,
anaesthetic concentrations severalfold greater than those
that produce immobility deﬁne the upper boundary of the
concentration range that is clinically relevant. for a target
to have any relevance for anaesthesia, it must at least be
sensitive to sublethal but immobilizing concentrations of
anaesthetics. this issue of relevant concentrations alone
poses a severe challenge to the plausibility of ‘lipid’
theories of anaesthetic action, since ‘nonspeciﬁc’ effects
of general anaesthetics (e.g., disruption of lipid bilayer
ﬂuidity) appear to be negligible at clinically relevant
concentrations [13–15].
while the issue of relevant concentrations is obviously of
paramount importance to molecular studies of general
anaesthetics, the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic
properties of the various anaesthetic drugs pose some
obstacles to the determination of relevant concentrations.
we will therefore outline the basic issues involved in the
determination of accurate clinically relevant anaesthetic
concentrations. this will provide a background to our
later discussion of those ligand-gated ion channels that
are modulated by clinically relevant concentrations of
general anaesthetics.
volatile anaesthetic potency is usually quantiﬁed in terms
of mac [133, 134]. mac values (often expressed in the
operating room in terms of percentage of anaesthetic gas

1284

m. d. krasowski and n. l. harrison

by volume) can be converted to ‘aqueous’ mac equiva
lent concentrations’ by use of the approgated ion channels
that are modulated by clinically relevant concentrations
of general anaesthetics.
volatile anaesthetic potency is usually quantiﬁed in terms
of mac [133, 134]. mac values (often expressed in the
operating room in terms of percentage of anaesthetic gas
by volume) can be converted to ‘aqueous’ mac equivalent concentrations’ by use of the appropriate water/gas
(or blood/gas) partition coefﬁcients [28, 138]. this provides an estimate for the concentration of anaesthetic in
the blood that is in equilibrium with the inspired partial
pressure of anaesthetic in the gas phase. franks and lieb
[28, 138] have thoroughly discussed the conversion of
mac values to aqueous equivalents, including the nettlesome issue of experimental temperature [138, 139].
aqueous mac equivalents are often used as guides for
in vitro experiments which involve the study of volatile
anaesthetics in aqueous solution [13, 28, 138].
the issue of clinically relevant concentrations for the
intravenous anaesthetics and the alcohols in mammals is
considerably more complicated because of pharmacokinetic aspects of these drugs and the difﬁculty of ascertaining steady-state drug concentrations in the brain [13]. in
some cases (e.g. for propofol and the barbiturates),
detailed pharmacokinetic studies have addressed these
issues, and reasonable free anaesthetic concentrations in
brain can be estimated [13]. in other cases (e.g. ketamine
and the steroid anaesthetic alphaxalone), only total
anaesthetic concentrations in blood are known, thus
invariably underestimating anaesthetic potency in the
brain of this class of anaesthetics, often by as much as
one to two orders of magnitude [140, 141].
table 1 lists concentrations of general anaesthetics that
represent the ec50 value for producing immobility in a
variety of animal species. there is a growing database of
studies that determine anaesthetic concentrations needed
to produce other anaesthetic endpoints involving higher
cortical functions [136, 137, 142]. however, such data are
not yet available for all anaesthetics. in some cases (see
table 1 and accompanying legend), no mammalian data
are available, or the mammalian data are likely to be
incorrect, due to signiﬁcant pharmacokinetic issues. in
these cases, we have reported the values for tadpoles, in
which pharmacokinetic impediments are considerably
attenuated [13, 143].
the receptor must be expressed in the appropriate anatomical locations to mediate the speciﬁc behavioral effects of
the anaesthetic. this is a more difﬁcult issue to discuss,
since there is considerable debate about precisely which
synaptic circuits are responsible for the various behavioral
functions perturbed by general anaesthetics. the immobility produced by general anaesthetics, perhaps not
surprisingly, appears to involve depression of spinal reﬂex
pathways, since it is independent of drug actions in the
brain [144–146]. receptors such as gabaa and ampa
receptors are promising general anaesthetic targets due to

for the volatile ethers and halothane, anaesthetic concentrations
are averages of multiple mac determinations in mammals [13,
28, 138]. solubility coefﬁcients and methods for converting mac
values (in partial pressures) to aqueous mac equivalents at
20 °c are described by franks and lieb [28, 138]. mammalian
anaesthetic values for alphaxalone [140], etomidate [275] and
 xxxd2599xxx  [276] reﬂect total anaesthetic concentrations in
blood with the extent of plasma protein binding uncertain. it is
also unclear whether steady-state levels were reached in these
studies. the stated concentrations thus likely substantially underestimate anaesthetic potency, possibly by as much as two orders
of magnitude. the human anaesthetic value for ketamine [277]
indicates stable plasma concentrations in patients maintained on
ketamine anaesthesia supplemented with nitrous oxide. the
anaesthetic concentration for ketamine alone may be double this
value, since ketamine was combined with nitrous oxide. anaesthetic concentrations for n-alcohols are averages of multiple
studies. all values for n-alcohols are from tadpoles except for one
study in rats [278].

their ubiquitous distribution and essential physiological
roles as the major fast transmitters of the cns. however,
given the uncertainty concerning the exact anatomy of the
synapses that are disrupted to produce the constellation
of behavioral effects seen during general anaesthesia,
receptors with more limited distribution (e.g. 5-ht3
receptors) may certainly play major roles as molecular
mediators of the general anaesthetic state.
if an anaesthetic molecule shows stereoselective effects in
vivo, these should be mirrored by the in vitro actions at the
receptor. stereoselectivity represents an important test
for the relevance of a putative anaesthetic target [13, 147].
a number of general anaesthetic molecules possess a
chiral carbon atom, and some pairs of stereoisomers exert
different anaesthetic potencies in vivo. stereoselectivity
for producing immobility has been documented for the
isomers of etomidate [15, 148] (see ﬁg. 4), the barbiturates
[149], isoﬂurane [150, 151] (although see [152]), ketamine
[153, 154] and steroid anaesthetics [155]. the potency
differences are greatest for stereoisomers of etomidate
and ketamine (greater than 10-fold), with smaller potency
differences (sometimes only 2-fold or less) seen for other
anaesthetic isomers. the formulation of these anaesthetics is usually based on the racemic mixture due to the
difﬁculty of separating enantiomers in large quantities (an
exception is etomidate, which is prepared by a chiral
synthesis [148]). production of pure enantiomers perhaps
would improve the clinical proﬁle for some general
anaesthetics [156], although cost considerations probably
preclude such an outcome.
general anaesthetic stereoselectivity poses the most
severe challenge yet to the ‘traditional’ lipid theories of
anaesthetic action. the optical isomers of isoﬂurane [157]
and etomidate [15], despite signiﬁcant differences in their
in vivo potency (see ﬁg. 4), behave identically with respect
to their ability to disorder lipid bilayers. in contrast,
stereoselectivity supports the plausibility of the gabaa
receptor as a target in mediating the actions of etomidate
[15], barbiturates [158, 159], isoﬂurane [160, 161], and the
steroid anaesthetics [155, 162], since in vivo potency and
activity at the gabaa receptor display identical trends.
the in vivo stereoselectivity of ketamine stereoisomers is
paralleled by the inhibitory action of the isomers at the
nmda receptor [163]. interestingly, two enantiomers of
pentobarbitone display opposing stereoselectivity for
inhibition of the muscle nicotinic ach receptor relative
to their in vivo potency [164]. the structure-activity
relationships for barbiturate inhibition of the muscle
nicotinic ach receptor also correlate poorly with in vivo
potency [165] which effectively eliminates the muscle-type
nicotinic ach receptor as a plausible target for barbiturate action. this is perhaps not surprising, since barbiturates (and, indeed, most other general anaesthetics) do not
inhibit neuromuscular transmission to any substantial

degree, suggesting little or no functional block of the
muscle nicotinic ach receptor at anaesthetic concentrations [2, 13]. the probable lack of relevance of muscle
nicotinic ach receptors for the actions of general anaesthetics certainly does not rule out the possibility that
general anaesthetic actions on neuronal nicotinic ach
receptors may play a major role in the behavioral actions
of general anaesthetics. the muscle and neuronal nicotinic ach receptors, despite sharing a common agonist,
have quite distinct structural and functional properties.
despite the rewards of studying general anaesthetic
stereoisomers, exempliﬁed by the etomidate work outlined above [15] (see ﬁg. 4), the stereoselectivity approach
has been underutilized, mainly due to the limited supply
and expense of puriﬁed stereoisomers [156]. furthermore,
only limited anaesthetic endpoints (mainly immobility)
have been assessed for the anaesthetic stereoisomers. it
would be quite interesting to know whether the additional
neurobiological actions of anaesthetics (e.g. amnesia,
analgesia) display similar patterns of stereoselectivity.

figure 4. the selectivity of etomidate optical isomers for producing general anaesthesia in tadpoles mirrors the selectivity for
potentiation of gabaa receptor function. the main graph illustrates the concentration-response curves for immobility produced
by etomidate stereoisomers in rana temporaria tadpoles. note
that the in vivo potency of r( +) etomidate is approximately one
order of magnitude greater than that of s( −) etomidate (also see
[148]). the inset depicts electrophysiological traces from gaba
responses at bovine gabaa h1i1k2l receptors stably transfected
in mouse l-cell ﬁbroblast cells. coapplication of r( +) etomidate
produces a vastly greater enhancement of the control submaximal
gaba response (c) than coapplication of s( −) etomidate. figure from: tomlin s. l., jenkins a., lieb w. r. and franks n. p.

the hydrophobicity of a compound within a homologous
series of anaesthetics should correlate with the in vivo
anaesthetic potency and that at the target receptor. the
so-called meyer-overton hypothesis, which led to the
adoption of the traditional dogma concerning lipid mechanisms of anaesthesia, arose from the fundamental observation that the in vivo potency of general anaesthetics
rises in parallel with increasing hydrophobicity of the
anaesthetic molecules. this trend is most noticeable with
the homologous series of n-alcohols (see table 1c) but also
holds true for diverse anaesthetic molecules with oil/water
partition coefﬁcients varying over numerous orders of
magnitude [3–5]. general anaesthetic actions at a plausible receptor target should, therefore, exhibit similar
trends.
the meyer-overton correlation was traditionally interpreted to suggest nonspeciﬁc mechanisms of action for
general anaesthetics in membrane lipids; however, an
alternative explanation is that anaesthetics bind to hydrophobic domains of receptor proteins [9, 13]. for example,
amino acid residues of hydrophobic character within the
transmembrane domains of ligand-gated ion channels
would be likely candidates to interact with general
anaesthetics. as will be discussed below, a number of
amino acid residues have been identiﬁed within ligandgated ion channels that are critical for the modulatory
actions of some general anaesthetics. many of these
amino acid residues are proposed to lie either within a
transmembrane domain or else at the membrane interface.
a major problem for traditional theories arose with the
discovery of hydrophobic compounds that disobey the
meyer-overton ‘rule’ [166]. these nonanaesthetics or
nonimmobilizers would be expected to partition extensively into the lipid bilayer yet produce no general
anaesthetic action. the nonimmobilizers provide additional clues as to which receptor targets might underlie
the behavioral actions of general anaesthetics (see below).

experimental approaches to studying general
anaesthetic actions at ligand-gated ion channels
general anaesthetic actions at ligand-gated ion channels
have been studied using a variety of methodologies,
including protein chemistry, radioligand binding, ion ﬂux
studies and electrophysiology [13, 24, 27]. we will focus
mainly on electrophysiological studies since these, in
general, provide superior time resolution and also offer
the possibility of analyzing isolated cells or even single ion
channels. the general anaesthetics have properties which
limit the utility of other experimental techniques. for
example, speciﬁc binding of radiolabeled general anaesthetics to ligand-gated ion channels has proven exceedingly difﬁcult to demonstrate due to low afﬁnity and high
nonspeciﬁc binding to neuronal membranes [13, 24, 27],

general anaesthetic actions on ligand-gated ion channels

although allosteric effects of general anaesthetics have
been monitored using radioligand binding of drugs to
other sites on the ligand-gated ion channels (e.g. [167,
168]). in addition, limited progress has been made in
developing anaesthetic congeners useful for photoafﬁnity
labeling or other covalent modiﬁcation of receptors
(although see [169]). these limitations contrast starkly
with the studies of other classes of agents at ligand-gated
ion channels. for instance, the high-afﬁnity benzodiazepine binding site on the gabaa receptor has been
mapped out in some detail due to the ability to perform
both speciﬁc radioligand binding and photoafﬁnity labeling [170, 171], which powerfully complements the extensive body of literature on electrophysiological actions of
benzodiazepines at gabaa receptors [170].
another exciting tool in the quest to establish the in vivo
signiﬁcance of a putative anaesthetic target is the use of
targeted gene manipulations in mice [172]. a variety of
manipulations are possible, including introducing a gene
not normally present (transgenic mice), removing an
endogenous gene (‘knockout mice’), or replacing an
endogenous gene with an altered copy (‘knock-in mice’)
[172]. gene targeting in mice has already been very
valuable for elucidating the mechanism of action for some
drugs. knockout of the gabaa k2 receptor subunit gene
resulted in mice which were effectively insensitive to the
sedative/hypnotic actions of benzodiazepines such as
diazepam [173]. the k2 subunit gene knockout, in conjunction with the dependence of benzodiazepine modulation of the gabaa receptor on the presence of a k subunit
[174], effectively demonstrates the gabaa receptor as a
major target mediating the sedative/hypnotic actions of
benzodiazepines. another gene-targeting experiment in
mice involved the replacement of the h2a-adrenoreceptor
with a dysfunctional receptor mutant. these knock-in
mice failed to show analgesic and sedative responses to
h2a-adrenoreceptor agonists such as dexmedetomidine
and clonidine [175].
knockout mice lacking subunit genes for gabaa (h6, i3,
k2, k2l) [173, 176–179], neuronal nicotinic ach (h7, i2)
[180, 181], ampa ( xxxg953xxx ) [182], nmda (nr1,  xxxg964xxx ,
 xxxg966xxx ,  xxxg968xxx ) [183–186] and kainate receptors ( xxxg959xxx )
[187] have already been created, and the study of such
mice has enhanced understanding of the physiological
roles of the particular receptor subunit. for example, mice
homozygous for a deletion of the gabaa receptor i3
subunit gene exhibit cleft palate, absence seizures, hyperexcitability [177, 188] and some resistance to the immobilizing actions of intravenous and volatile anaesthetics
[189].

actions of general anaesthetics at ligand-gated ion channels
general anaesthetics act as positive or negative allosteric modulators of agonist actions at ligand-gated

cmls, cell. mol. life sci. vol. 55, 1999

ion channels. among the ligand-gated ion channels,
there is no known case in which the anaesthetic competes for the same binding site as the endogenous neurotransmitter. the most extensively examined ligand-gated
ion channel target for general anaesthetics has been the
gabaa receptor [13, 24, 27]. virtually every general
anaesthetic tested enhances the function of the gabaa
receptor at clinically relevant concentrations [13, 27,
190] (except for ketamine [191], xenon [192] and possibly
nitrous oxide [193–195]). general anaesthetic enhancement of gabaa receptor function is evident in singlecell electrophysiological experiments as potentiation of a
submaximal gaba response (see ﬁg. 5) or, at the
synaptic level, as prolongation of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials [196, 197] or currents (see ﬁg. 6) [160,
198–200]. potentiation of submaximal gaba-induced
currents remains the most popular assay for electrophysiological experiments since it is easily reproducible and
can be used to study native gabaa receptors in dissociated neurones or recombinant receptors expressed in
mammalian cell lines or xenopus oocytes [13, 24, 27].
some anaesthetics, particularly the intravenous agents,
open the gabaa receptor chloride channel in the absence of agonist [201–214]. this ‘direct activation’ by
general anaesthetics involves a binding site completely
distinct from that for classical gabaa receptor agonists
such as gaba and muscimol [215]. although direct
activation usually occurs at supraclinical concentrations,
direct activation effects do sometimes occur at lower
concentrations for some anaesthetics (e.g. propofol),
suggesting possible clinical relevance. direct activation
by anaesthetics has been observed in other ligand-gated
ion channels (e.g. for the anaesthetic isoﬂurane at the
strychinine-sensitive  xxxg904xxx  [216]) but is most
pronounced at the gabaa receptor.
the cloning of multiple subunit isoforms for the ligandgated ion channels in the last decade has precipitated an
explosion of studies of general anaesthetic actions on
recombinant receptors. table 2 summarizes the electrophysiological effects of general anaesthetics on a range
of ligand-gated ion channels studied in neurones or in
various expression systems.
a difﬁcult issue to address is how much alteration of
receptor function by a general anaesthetic is necessary to
produce certain behavioral actions. for example, even
though the ec50 or ic50 (concentration of antagonist
that reduces the response to a sub-maximal concentration of agonist by 50 %) for alteration of the
function of a particular receptor by an anaesthetic
may be well outside the clinically relevant range
(the upper limit of this range is deﬁned by the
anaesthetic concentration that produces immobility in
100% of subjects), the anaesthetic may nevertheless
produce slight alteration of receptor function within
the clinically relevant concentration range [13]. thus,

in order to qualify for inclusion in table 2, a study had
to (i) assess the effects of several different anaesthetic
concentrations in order to derive an estimate for the ec50
or ic50 (concentration of antagonist that reduces the
response to a sub-maximal concentration of agonist by
50%) for modulation and (ii) offer a reasonable certainty
of examining a ‘pure’ receptor population. the latter
concern is especially acute with the ampa and kainate

general anaesthetic actions on ligand-gated ion channels

antagonists. kainate itself activates both ampa and
kainate receptors, and this may confound electrophysiological studies which utilize kainate application to neurones.
the advent of cloning and recombinant expression techniques has greatly accelerated and facilitated attempts to
classify ligand-gated ion channel sensitivity to general
anaesthetics. molecular biology techniques may now be
used to determine which regions of ligand-gated ion
channels are critical for anaesthetic modulation. sensitivity to general anaesthetics varies considerably, sometimes
even among closely related receptors (table 2), and this
forms the basis for the use of ‘chimeric’ receptors to
isolate regions of a receptor essential for anaesthetic
modulation. chimeric receptors are created by joining
together, at the complementary dna (cdna) level,
complementary fragments of receptor subunits, in which
the parental subunits exhibit markedly different anaesthetic pharmacologies. the analysis of chimeric receptors
can be used to delimit a region of a receptor essential for
general anaesthetic modulation, after which site-directed
mutagenesis can be used to identify key residues.
chimeric receptors constructed to date include panels of
gabaa/glycine [217], gabaa/gabac z [218], glycine/
gabac z [219, 220], neuronal nicotinic ach/5-ht3
[221, 222] and ampa  xxxg954xxx /kainate  xxxg959xxx  [223] receptors. the most extensive sets of chimeras created and
functionally expressed for analysis of anaesthetic modulation are glycine/gabac z [219, 220] and  xxxg954xxx /
 xxxg959xxx  [223] chimeras.
several problems may arise in the study of such chimeric
receptors, including (i) lack of functional expression
(greatly reduced or absent responses to agonist), (ii)
chimeric receptor function that differs radically from the
constituent parent receptors, and/or (iii) ambiguous
pharmacological data. the ﬁrst problem has substantially limited the utility of gabaa/gabac [224] and
neuronal nicotinic ach/5-ht3 chimeras [225]; for instance, chimeras formed between the nicotinic ach h7
subunit and the  xxxg1116xxx  show functional expression only when the nicotinic h7 receptor subunit provides
the n-terminal half but not vice versa [225]. lack of
functional chimeric receptor responses could potentially
be due to protein folding or assembly problems, impaired
ion permeation leading to very low single-channel conductance and/or a minuscule probability of opening
following agonist binding (i.e. a defect in ion channel
gating). folding and assembly problems probably predominate and seem especially likely to occur when
blending heteromeric with homomeric receptors (e.g.
gabaa with gabac receptors). despite these potential
pitfalls, the use of chimeric receptors has already helped
to deﬁne putative sites of general anaesthetic action on
some of the ligand-gated ion channels (see below).

subunit combination is present (e.g. short-chain alcohol actions on neuronal nicotinic ach receptors [267]). all receptors are mammalian except for one study of snail neuronal nicotinic ach
receptors [279]. this study was included since there are no published data of the effects of some general anaesthetics on mammalian neuronal nicotinic ach receptors.

actions of general anaesthetics at ligand-gated ion
channels
volatile anaesthetics and anaesthetic gases
volatile anaesthetics (e.g. halogenated ethers such as
isoﬂurane and alkanes such as halothane) alter the
function of many ligand-gated ion channels at reasonable concentrations. in general, submaximal agonist
responses at gabaa, glycine, 5-ht3 and  xxxg959xxx  receptors are enhanced by volatile anaesthetics, whereas agonist responses at neuronal nicotinic ach and  xxxg954xxx 
receptors are inhibited (table 2a). the low potency and
physicochemical properties of the volatile anaesthetics
pose some technical challenges for in vitro experiments
[13, 27, 28, 138]. nevertheless, recent years have witnessed a steady increase in the quality and quantity of
careful studies of volatile anaesthetic actions on ligandgated ion channels.
considerable progress has been made in identifying
amino acid residues within gabaa, glycine and
kainate receptors that are critical for volatile anaesthetic potentiation of agonist-induced currents. the use
of a panel of glycine h1/gabac z1 chimeric receptors
allowed the implication of a 45-amino acid region encompassing tm2 and  xxxg2318xxx  of the glycine  xxxg1078xxx  as
both necessary and sufﬁcient for potentiation of agonist-induced currents by the volatile ether enﬂurane
[219]. extensive site-directed mutagenesis of glycine h1
and gabaa h2 and i1 subunits determined that speciﬁc amino acid positions within tm2 and  xxxg2318xxx  are
also critical for agonist potentiation by isoﬂurane [206,
219] (see ﬁgs 3 and 5), n-alcohols (including ethanol)
[219, 220, 226] and trichloroethanol [227] (see ﬁg. 3).
agonist potentiation by propofol [206] and etomidate
[228, 229] is also inﬂuenced by some or all of these
amino acid positions (see ﬁg. 3). in contrast to the
situation at gabaa and glycine receptors, in tm4 of
 xxxg959xxx  kainate receptors, residue  xxxg819xxx  is critical for
volatile anaesthetic (e.g. isoﬂurane, enﬂurane,
halothane) enhancement but not ethanol or pentobarbitone inhibition of submaximal kainate responses
[223].
an obvious extension of the work described above with
gabaa and glycine receptors is to determine whether
homologous residues in the evolutionarily related neuronal nicotinic ach and 5-ht3 receptors also play
crucial roles in volatile anaesthetic actions. preliminary
evidence suggests that such is indeed the case at the
 xxxg1116xxx . some mutations in tm2 of the 5-ht3
receptor abolish the agonist-potentiating actions of
volatile ethers such as enﬂurane and isoﬂurane (s. j.
mihic, personal communication).
most halogenated alkanes and ethers containing six or
fewer carbons have anaesthetic properties, but some
notable exceptions to this rule exist. the work of eger,

general anaesthetic actions on ligand-gated ion channels

koblin and colleagues has demonstrated that certain
highly lipid-soluble halogenated cyclobutanes and alkanes are unable to produce immobility at concentrations
predicted by the meyer-overton correlation to be in
the anaesthetic range [166]. these compounds, originally called nonanaesthetics, are now more properly
referred to as nonimmobilizers, since although they do
not produce immobility [166] or analgesia [230], they
may interfere with learning and memory [231]. the
nonimmobilizers, which are often heavily halogenated
compounds (e.g. 1,2-dichlorohexaﬂuorocyclobutane),
elicit convulsions at higher concentrations [166]. the
nonimmobilizers have no modulatory actions at
gabaa [232], glycine [233], gabac z [234], 5-ht3
[235], neuronal nicotinic ach [236], ampa or kainate
receptors [237]. the nonimmobilizers have, however,
been shown to alter the function of muscarinic ach
[238], muscle nicotinic ach [239] and metabotropic
glutamate receptors [240] at concentrations of the nonimmobilizers predicted to be anaesthetic. these results
would seem to exclude the muscle nicotinic ach muscarinic ach and metabotropic glutamate receptors as
viable molecular targets for producing immobility.
these receptors may certainly play a role in other
actions important in general anaesthesia such as amnesia, since nonimmobilizers and general anaesthetics
share some behavioral actions in common.
the anaesthetic gases nitrous oxide and xenon have a
pattern of action on the ligand-gated ion channels different from the volatile ethers and alkanes (see table
2a). this is perhaps not surprising since the clinical
effects of xenon and nitrous oxide vary from that of the
ethers and alkanes; for instance, unlike the ethers and
alkanes, nitrous oxide is a potent analgesic with only
weak immobilizing activity [2]. nitrous oxide inhibits
agonist responses at nmda receptors [194, 195] but
has only weak potentiating actions at gabaa receptors [193–195]. very recently, xenon has been demonstrated to inhibit nmda receptors at clinically
relevant concentrations but does not modulate the
function of gabaa or ampa receptors [192]. the
anaesthetic properties of xenon and krypton have long
presented a challenge for molecular theories of anaesthesia, since these noble gases are among the simplest
of molecules that produce anaesthesia [241]. intriguingly, argon, xenon and krypton all possess anaesthetic
properties, whereas the smaller noble gases helium and
neon do not produce anaesthesia even at hyperbaric
concentrations [242]. the nmda receptor inhibition
produced by xenon and nitrous oxide, with a lack of
potent actions on gabaa receptors, resembles the actions of the ‘dissociative anaesthetic’ ketamine at ligand-gated ion channels (see below).

intravenous agents
etomidate and propofol both appear to be relatively
selective for the gabaa receptor (table 2b). the gabaa
receptor fulﬁlls all the criteria as a plausible target
underlying the anaesthetic actions of these compounds.
propofol and etomidate do not modulate other ligandgated ion channels at clinically relevant concentrations
with the exception of propofol actions at the strychninesensitive  xxxg904xxx  [207, 233, 243]. amino acid
residues within the i subunit of the gabaa receptor
have been identiﬁed that are essential for potentiation of
gabaa receptor function by etomidate [228, 229, 244]
and propofol [206] (see ﬁg. 3), consistent with previous
studies suggesting that the i subunit of the gabaa
receptor was likely to contain binding sites for these
compounds [211, 245, 246].
many steroid anaesthetics such as alphaxalone are relatively selective for the gabaa receptor, although certain
steroids have potent actions on other ligand-gated ion
channels (see table 2b). for the steroid anaesthetics,
structure-activity studies comparing in vivo and in vitro
potencies support a role for gabaa receptors in the
actions of these compounds [32, 33, 247– 249]. for
example, the nonanaesthetic isomer structural betaxalone does not modulate the gabaa receptor [250, 251].
there have been extensive (although as yet not completely fruitful) attempts to synthesize steroid anaesthetics with improved therapeutic properties over the
prototype alphaxalone, and many of these analogs have
been tested at the gabaa receptor [252–254]. critical
residues for modulation by alphaxalone or other steroid
anaesthetics have not yet been identiﬁed within any
ligand-gated ion channel, although studies of gabaa/
glycine chimeric receptors suggest a major contribution
of the n-terminal extracellular domain of the gabaa
receptor to gaba potentiation by alphaxalone [255].
unlike propofol, etomidate and the steroid anaesthetics,
the barbiturates are much less selective. in addition to
their actions at gabaa receptors, barbiturates also
potently inhibit ampa, kainate and neuronal nach
receptors (table 2b). the inhibition of ampa receptors
by barbiturates is voltage- and use-dependent [256, 257].
studies of recombinant ampa receptors have revealed
that the potency of pentobarbitone block is critically
dependent on a glutamine/arginine site in the pore-forming loop of  xxxg953xxx  subunits [258]. the presence of a
glutamine or arginine at this site is determined by speciﬁc
rna editing of the  xxxg953xxx  rna and strongly inﬂuences
the ion selectivity and permeation properties of receptors
containing the  xxxg953xxx  subunit [259, 260]. the observation
that pentobarbitone block depends on the glutamine/
arginine site, together with the voltage- and use-dependence of the block, indicates penetration of barbiturates
deep into the ion-conducting pore of ampa receptors.
optical isomers of pentobarbitone display the same order

of potency for modulatory actions at the gabaa receptor as for their in vivo anaesthetic actions [13, 159]. a
residue within tm2 of the i1 subunit of the gabaa
receptor has been suggested to be necessary for gaba
potentiation by pentobarbitone [261] (see ﬁg. 3). agonist
potentiation by barbiturates is not altered by mutations
in gabaa receptors that abolish potentiation by volatile
anaesthetics, n-alcohols, propofol or trichloroethanol
[206, 219, 227]. similarly, a mutation within tm4 of the
kainate  xxxg959xxx  receptor that ablates volatile anaesthetic
enhancement of submaximal kainate responses does not
alter inhibition by barbiturates [223].
compared with other intravenous anaesthetic agents
discussed above, the ‘dissociative anaesthetic’ ketamine
has a very different in vivo and in vitro proﬁle of action
(table 2b). ketamine and related arylcycloalkylamines
such as phencyclidine produce an atypical state of ‘dissociative’ anaesthesia, characterized by sedation, immobility, amnesia, marked analgesia and a feeling of
dissociation from the environment, without true unconsciousness [262]. these compounds can also produce
intense hallucinations that limit their clinical use, especially in adults [2]. in contrast with most other general
anaesthetics, ketamine does not potentiate gabaa receptor function at clinically relevant concentrations [191].
ketamine appears instead to produce anaesthesia by
inhibition of nmda receptors [163, 250, 263–265],
although ketamine is also a potent inhibitor of neuronal
nicotinic ach receptors so contributions from these
receptors cannot be ruled out [264]. nmda receptors
satisfy all of the pharmacological criteria expected of
molecular targets for ketamine and phencyclidine, including stereoselectivity [163]. a site of ketamine action
on the nmda receptor has not yet been elucidated,
although single-channel studies have explored the mechanism of ketamine inhibition at nmda receptors in
detail [263].

alcohols
the alcohols display very little selectivity among the
ligand-gated ion channels. in fact, all of the ligand-gated
ion channels considered in this review are modulated by
anaesthetic concentrations of most alcohols (table 2c).
this obfuscates attempts to dissect the molecular underpinnings underlying the diverse behavioral actions of the
alcohols. neuronal nicotinic ach receptors appear to be
exquisitely sensitive to alcohols, in some cases showing
modulation by ethanol concentrations as low as 1–10
mm [266, 267]. mammalian blood alcohol concentrations in this range produce only mild intoxication [268].
as described above, residues within tm2 and  xxxg2318xxx  of
gabaa and glycine receptors are critically important for
the agonist-potentiating actions of the n-alcohols,
trichloroethanol and the volatile ether anaesthetics [206,
219, 220, 226, 227] (see ﬁgs 3 and 5).

m. d. krasowski and n. l. harrison

the demonstration of a ‘cutoff’ phenomenon for the in
vivo actions of the straight-chain alcohols has presented
challenges for many molecular theories of anaesthesia.
potencies of the primary alcohols in producing immobility increase with increasing number of carbon atoms (n),
but only up to a certain size (the cutoff), after which
alcohols with longer carbon chains decline in potency or
remain equipotent with the (n − 1)-alcohols [143, 269,
270]. we have followed previous suggestions [13, 220] in
deﬁning cutoff as the point at which the potency of the
n-alcohol no longer increases with increasing carbon
chain length. as with stereoselectivity, the alcohol cutoff
poses severe problems for nonspeciﬁc theories of anaesthetic action, since there appears to be no cutoff for the
disordering actions of n-alcohols on lipid bilayers [14]. in
general, the immobilizing actions of n-alcohols show a
cutoff around  xxxd1922xxx  (c12) [143, 269, 270], although
the limited aqueous solubility of long-chain alcohols can
complicate matters [271]. the alcohol cutoff for the
ligand-gated ion channels varies between receptors (see
table 2c), and this could be useful in implicating or
eliminating speciﬁc receptors in the various biological
effects of the alcohols.
alcohol cutoff has recently been applied to the study of
glycine and gabac z1 receptors harboring mutations in
tm2 and  xxxg2318xxx . it was ﬁrst noted that mutation of a
smaller to a larger amino acid residue in tm2 of the
glycine h1 subunit (serine-267 to glutamine) reduced the
alcohol cutoff for the  xxxg904xxx  from  xxxd1922xxx 
(c12) to  xxxd3026xxx  (c3) [220]. in contrast, a double
mutation of larger to smaller residues in tm2 and  xxxg2318xxx 
of the gabac z1 receptor extended the alcohol cutoff
from heptanol (c7) to beyond  xxxd1922xxx  (c12) [220].
these data provide strong evidence that mutation of
selected residues within tm2 and  xxxg2318xxx  of glycine and
gabac receptors may actually alter the dimensions of
a binding pocket for n-alcohols.

discussion and future directions
substantial progress has been made in the last decade in
deﬁning the actions of general anaesthetic agents on
ligand-gated ion channels, particularly in the areas of
molecular biology, pharmacology and electrophysiology.
the coming years will surely witness more major advances, perhaps most notably from the application of
structural biology and gene-targeting approaches. the
use of site-directed mutagenesis and chimeric receptors
has proven very helpful in identifying regions of ligandgated ion channels that play critical roles in modulation
by general anaesthetics. however, more deﬁnite evidence
of the existence of general anaesthetic binding pockets
probably awaits the resolution of three-dimensional
structures for the ligand-gated ion channels. structural
biology approaches have already been applied to the
study of general anaesthetic interactions with model

general anaesthetic actions on ligand-gated ion channels

soluble proteins [20], including the recent report of the
2.2-a, resolution three-dimensional structure of ﬁreﬂy
luciferase complexed with the general anaesthetic bromoform [272].
in common with other many integral membrane proteins,
ligand-gated ion channels have proved recalcitrant to
structural biology approaches. however, the crystallization and determination of a high-resolution structure for
a bacterial  xxxg1232xxx  [273] surely foreshadows
the eventual determination of the three-dimensional
structure of the ligand-gated ion channels. a more
immediate possibility is the determination of the structure of limited domains of ligand-gated ion channels;
indeed, researchers have very recently succeeded in resolving the structure of the extracellular domain of an
ionotropic  xxxg981xxx  complexed with kainate
[274]. even in the absence of detailed structures, molecular modeling may be of use in making preliminary
predictions that can be tested experimentally.
targeted gene manipulations in mice will also provide
hypothesis-driven tests of the in vivo roles of certain
ligand-gated ion channels in mediating the diverse behavioral actions of general anaesthetics. as described above,
researchers over the last 5 years have created ‘global
knockout mice’ for various subunits of the ligand-gated
ion channels. given the abundance of ligand-gated ion
channel knockout mice (and the commercial availability
of some of these knockouts), it would be a logical step
to test anaesthetic sensitivity in some or all of these mice.
however, while knockout mice may provide initial clues
as to the nature of anaesthetic targets, such mice can be
very difﬁcult to analyze for anaesthetic sensitivity if they
exhibit grossly abnormal motor behavior, lethality or
aberrations in neural development. these problems with
knockout mice may be circumvented by ‘conditional’
gene knockouts, in which the gene of interest is disrupted
only in limited brain regions and/or speciﬁed developmental time periods [172].
another elegant example of gene targeting is a ‘knock-in’
mouse. one possibility is the introduction of a mutated
receptor subunit that is insensitive to anaesthetic modulation in place of the normal endogenous receptor subunit (e.g. see [175]). this type of approach has recently
been applied to the benzodiazepines. these studies utilized knock-in mice expressing a mutant gabaa receptor h1 subunit that confers insensitivity to benzodiazepine
modulation, in place of the benzodiazepine-sensitive
wild-type h1 subunit. these preliminary studies have not
only demonstrated the importance of the gabaa h1
subunit isoform for the behavioral actions of benzodiazepines but also have suggested that distinct gabaa
receptor h subunit isoforms mediate different actions of
the benzodiazepines, with the h1 subunit isoform necessary for sedative and anticonvulsant effects and other
h-subunit isoforms critical for myorelaxant and anxiolytic actions (u. rudolph, f. crestani, h. möhler,
personal communication).

cmls, cell. mol. life sci. vol. 55, 1999

knock-in mouse experiments potentially provide an elegant bridge between in vitro experiments and whole
animal behavior. ideally, the mutated receptor subunit
would differ from the normal subunit only in terms of
general anaesthetic modulation (i.e. agonist binding,
channel gating, voltage dependence, kinetics etc. of the
receptor would be relatively normal). recently described
mutations within tm2 and  xxxg2318xxx  of gabaa (see ﬁg. 3)
and glycine receptors, which confer insensitivity to
volatile ether anaesthetics [206, 219], n-alkanols [219, 220,
226], propofol [206], trichloroethanol [227], pentobarbitone [261] and etomidate [228, 229] essentially ﬁt this
qualiﬁcation, as do point mutations within  xxxg959xxx  kainate
receptors that abolish volatile anaesthetic potentiation
[223]. a complication to gene-targeting experiments is the
presence of multiple subunit isoforms for the ligand-gated
ion channels. for example, there are at least 17 gene
products for gabaa receptor subunits; if multiple
gabaa subunit isoforms play a role in general anaesthesia, then targeting of multiple genes may be required to
obtain an unambiguous change in anaesthetic sensitivity.
general anaesthetics produce a range of behavioral
effects in animals and humans. it appears overly simplistic
to ascribe all of these to a single receptor. current and
future research should eventually deﬁne the speciﬁc
receptors that underlie each of the diverse behavioral
actions of every class of general anaesthetics. the upcoming decade will undoubtedly be an exciting time for
research into the molecular mechanisms of general anaesthetics.
