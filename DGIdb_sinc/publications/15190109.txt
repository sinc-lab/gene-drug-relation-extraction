 xxxg2334xxx  is a nonselective cation channel activated by cold and the cooling compounds menthol and icilin (peier et al., 2002). here, we have
used electrophysiology and the calcium-sensitive dye fura-2 to study the effect of ph and interactions between temperature, ph, and the
two chemical agonists menthol and icilin on  xxxg2334xxx  expressed in chinese hamster ovary cells. menthol, icilin, and cold all evoked
stimulus-dependent [ca 2⫹]i responses in standard physiological solutions of ph 7.3. increasing the extracellular [h ⫹] from ph 7.3 to
approximately ph 6 abolished responses to icilin and cold stimulation but did not affect responses to menthol. icilin concentration–
response curves were significantly shifted to the right when ph was lowered from 7.3 to 6.9, whereas those with menthol were unaltered
in solutions of ph 6.1. when cells were exposed to solutions in the range of ph 8.1– 6.5, the temperature threshold for activation was
elevated at higher ph and depressed at lower ph. superfusing cells with a low subactivating concentration of icilin or menthol elevated the
threshold for cold activation at ph 7.4, but cooling failed to evoke [ca 2⫹]i responses at ph 6 in the presence of either agonist. in
voltage-clamp experiments in which the intracellular ph was buffered to different levels, acidification reduced the current amplitude of
icilin responses and shifted the threshold for cold activation to lower values with half-maximal inhibition at ph 7.2 and ph 7.6.

introduction
the transient receptor potential (trp) channel  xxxg2334xxx  is a
ca 2⫹-permeable nonselective cation channel activated by cold
and the cooling compounds menthol and icilin (tsavaler et al.,
2001; mckemy et al., 2002; peier et al., 2002).  xxxg2334xxx  is expressed in the small drg neurons and in neurons from trigeminal ganglia (mckemy et al., 2002; peier et al., 2002). in mouse
drg neurons in vivo,  xxxg2334xxx  is not colocalized with either
trpv1, ib4 binding, or cgrp (peier et al., 2002), whereas a
proportion of trpv1-positive drg neurons in culture express
 xxxg2334xxx  (reid et al., 2002; story et al., 2003). this pattern of
expression, in small unmyelinated cells distinct from polymodal
nociceptors, is consistent with a role in thermosensation and
nociception (noxious cold). furthermore, the activation threshold of  xxxg2334xxx  is similar to the reported threshold for noxious
cold in human tissues (klement and arndt, 1992). although
 xxxg2334xxx  is a prime candidate to detect cold and noxious cold
stimulus, not all cold-responsive peripheral neurons express
 xxxg2334xxx  (nealen et al., 2003; story et al., 2003). indeed, a novel
trp channel ( xxxg2331xxx  or trpa1) is expressed in a population
of drg neurons that lack  xxxg2334xxx  and is activated by cold (story
et al., 2003). another ion channel that has been suggested to act as

a cold receptor is  xxxg1256xxx , a twin-pore domain  xxxg1232xxx  that is inhibited by cold (maingret et al., 2000).
studies on the thermosensitive trpv1 channel have illustrated the importance of external ph (pho) on channel function.
changes in the ph in the (patho)physiological range can modulate
the ability of capsaicin to activate trpv1 (kress et al., 1996; tominaga et al., 1998; mclatchie and bevan, 2001). acidification to ph
⬍6.5 can also activate trpv1 at room temperature by lowering the
thermal threshold for activation (tominaga et al., 1998).
in this study, we investigated the effects of ph on the activation of  xxxg2334xxx  induced by two chemical mediators, menthol and
icilin, and by cold. our results demonstrate that ph has a differential effect on  xxxg2334xxx  activation and that the modulatory effect
is determined by intracellular ph (phi). acidic ph inhibits responses to icilin and cold, whereas alkaline ph has a potentiating
effect. in contrast, menthol responses are not affected by ph,
suggesting that activation by icilin and cold involve a different
mechanism to activation by menthol.

materials and methods
cell culture. chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells expressing mouse
 xxxg2334xxx  (generated as described by peier et al., 2002) were grown in
mem ␣ medium, without ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides,
supplemented with penicillin (100 u/ml), streptomycin (100 ␮g/ml),
l-glutamine (2 mm), fcs (10%), and hygromycin b (200 ␮g/ml).
imaging of intracellular calcium levels. to study intracellular calcium
([ca 2⫹]i) levels in a population of cells, fluorescence was measured using
a flexstation (molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca). cells were plated in
black 96-well plates (corning, corning, ny), at an approximate density
of 30,000 cells/well and grown overnight. cells were loaded for ⬃1 hr
with 2 ␮m fura-2 am (molecular probes, leiden, the netherlands) in

were changed by local microperfusion of solution through a fine pipette positioned very close
to the cells being studied. the temperature of
the perfusion buffer was controlled by a regulated peltier device (marlow industries, dallas,
tx) and monitored by a thermocouple positioned in the tip of the pipette. images of a
group of cells were captured every 2 sec at 340
and 380 nm excitation wavelengths with emission measured at 520 nm with an imaging system (pti, south brunswick, nj). analyses of
emission intensity ratios at 340 nm/380 nm excitation (r, in individual cells) were performed
with the imagemaster suite of software.

measured using a flexstation (molecular devices). cells were prepared in the same way as
described above for measuring [ca 2⫹]i and

2 mm probenecid and 0.01% pluronic f-127 at
37°c. emission intensity was measured every 5
sec using excitation wavelengths of 440 and 490
nm and an emission of 535 nm. a standard
curve of phi was constructed in the presence of
20 ␮m nigericin in a buffer prepared as above,
except for an equimolar substitution of 110 mm
nacl by kcl. to change pho, cells were kept in a
weakly buffered solution (1 mm hepes, ph 7.3),
and after 22 sec solution (three times the volume
present in the well; buffered with 10 mm hepes
or mes) was added to reach the desired ph. the
final ph of the solutions was determined in parallel experiments by direct measurement.

tion. in some cells, responses to menthol desensitized very little,
but in other cells the currents desensitized almost entirely within
5–10 sec (fig. 1 e). because icilin (but not menthol) requires the
presence of extracellular ca 2⫹ to activate  xxxg2334xxx  (mckemy et
al., 2002), we could not use ca 2⫹-free solutions to minimize
ca 2⫹-dependent desensitization.

 xxxg2334xxx  heterologously expressed in cho cells. both icilin and
menthol induced concentration-dependent [ca 2⫹]i responses in
flexstation assays with estimated ec50 values of 125 ⫾ 30 nm for
icilin (n ⫽ 7) and 101 ⫾ 13 ␮m for menthol (n ⫽ 11), in solutions
of physiological ph 7.3 (fig. 1 a,b). to study temperatureinduced activation, we used an imaging system that allowed us to
monitor the [ca 2⫹]i levels in individual cells. exposing cells to a
cooling ramp induced [ca 2⫹]i responses with an activation
threshold of 22.6 ⫾ 0.7°c (an average of four determinations of
groups of individual cells; n ⫽ 18 –31) (fig. 1c). menthol, icilin,
and cold did not produce [ca 2⫹]i responses in untransfected
cho cells (data not shown). in voltage-clamp experiments, all
three stimuli evoked currents (fig. 1 d–f ), but responses to icilin
developed after a short lag period and desensitized rapidly and
completely (1 d). in contrast, menthol responses occurred with
no obvious lag and showed a more varying degree of desensitiza-

effects of pho on [ca2ⴙ]i responses evoked by icilin, menthol,
and cold
changing the extracellular ph to values in the range 5.4 –7.4 did
not elicit [ca 2⫹]i responses in the absence of other stimuli (data
not shown). we next tested whether acidification of the external
solution could affect [ca 2⫹]i responses induced by a single concentration of agonist (1 ␮m icilin or 1 mm menthol) or by a
temperature stimulus of 17°c (the temperature of the superfusate
was ramped from 35°c to 17°c) (fig. 2). these stimuli were
chosen because they could be expected to evoke large responses.
in solutions of pho 6 or below, icilin and cold no longer induced
[ca 2⫹]i responses (fig. 2 a, b). pho-response curves showed that
protons inhibited both cold and icilin with a pic50 value of ph
6.3 ⫾ 0.1 (fig. 2c,d). in contrast, [ca 2⫹]i responses induced by
1 mm menthol were unaffected by exposure to solutions with pho
values as low as 5.4 (fig. 2c). to ensure that an inhibitory action
of protons against menthol was not overlooked when using a
single high concentration of agonist, we constructed concentration–response curves with menthol and icilin in solutions of different ph (fig. 3 a, b). acidification of the extracellular solution
to ph 6.9 significantly inhibited [ca 2⫹]i responses to icilin compared with ph 7.3 and shifted the agonist concentration–response curve from a pec50 value of 7.2 ⫾ 0.1 at ph 7.3 to a pec50
value of 6.6 ⫾ 0.1 at ph 6.9 ( p ⬍ 0.001; n ⫽ 10). when ph was
decreased further, the icilin concentration–response curves were
shifted even further to the right, and the maximal responses were
depressed (fig. 3a). as in the experiments using only a single
concentration of menthol (fig. 2c), neither the ec50 values nor
the maximal response induced by menthol were significantly affected by acidification of the extracellular solution down to ph
6.1 ( p ⬎ 0.05; n ⫽ 6) (fig. 3b).
the temperature threshold can be modulated by the presence of
menthol (mckemy et al., 2002; peier et al., 2002; reid et al., 2002)
and by icilin (fig. 3c). superfusing cells at 37°c for 1 min with a
subactivating concentration (at this temperature) of icilin (100 nm)
or menthol (25 ␮m) before starting a cold ramp caused a leftward
shift of the temperature–response curve and
elevated the threshold for temperature activation from 22.4 ⫾ 0.6°c in the absence of
agonist (n ⫽ 4) to 26.3 ⫾ 1.4°c (100 nm
icilin; n ⫽ 5) and 32 ⫾ 0.9°c (25 ␮m menthol; n ⫽ 4). when the same experiments
were performed in an external solution of
ph 6, no [ca 2⫹]i responses developed
with either agonist, indicating that low ph
abolished the synergy between cold and
the two agonists (n ⫽ 4) (fig. 3c).

caused a rightward shift of the responses to icilin, followed by insurmountable inhibition at lower pho (experiment shown is

pec50 ; one-way anova; n ⫽ 4). c, effect of menthol and icilin on [ca 2⫹]i responses induced by cold stimulation. cells were
superfused at 37°c with a solution of pho 7.3 containing 25 ␮m menthol, 100 nm icilin (agonist concentrations that did not produce
[ca 2⫹]i responses on their own at this temperature) or vehicle for 1 min before they were stimulated by a temperature ramp down
to 15°c. responses to cold were significantly shifted to higher temperatures in the presence of either agonist ( p ⬍ 0.001; n ⫽ 4
for menthol and n ⫽ 5 for icilin, in which each determination was the mean response of n ⫽ 21–31 individual cells). when the
same experiments were performed in solutions of pho 6, no [ca 2⫹]i response developed in the absence or presence of either
agonist (n ⫽ 4).

figure 4. ph modulates  xxxg2334xxx  activation at an intracellular site. a, although icilin could still evoke inward currents after a 2
min exposure to pho 5.4, intracellular acidification reduced the current amplitude evoked by 1 ␮m icilin with an estimated
half-maximal inhibition of ph 7.2 (n ⫽ 5–9). inward currents evoked by 1 mm menthol were smaller than currents evoked by 1 ␮m
icilin and not affected by intracellular ph (n ⫽ 12–16). b, the latency before icilin-evoked currents developed was increased by
intracellular acidification. data points are averages of cells responding within 120 sec (n ⫽ 5–9 cells, except for phi 6.5, where the
only two responding cells are included individually); three of five cells recorded at phi 6.5 and two of seven cells recorded at phi 6.9
failed to respond during 120 sec. c, intracellular acidification did not affect the time course of icilin-evoked currents. the rise time
(time from 10 to 90% of current developed) and the ␶ (inactivation) was similar at all phi tested. because only two cells responded
at phi 6.5, the individual data points are shown (n ⫽ 5–9 for the other phi values). d, representative recordings illustrating how
phi affects icilin-evoked currents. as shown in a and b, the current amplitude is depressed and the latency is increased by
intracellular acidification. the box demonstrates that inward currents evoked by menthol were unaffected by phi 6.5 (compare
with fig. 1 e). e, extracellular acidification reduced the phi in a time- and ph-dependent manner. cells were incubated in pho 7.3
(weakly buffered with 1 mm hepes). after 22 sec, the pho was changed from 7.3 to the indicated values by adding a three times
larger volume of strongly buffered solution (10 mm hepes or mes). error bars have been omitted for clarity.

tracellular environment, we examined the effect of changing either the external or internal ph on responses to 1 ␮m icilin in
voltage-clamp experiments (fig. 4). changing the ph of the extracellular solutions from ph 7.4 to ph 6 or ph 5.4 reduced the
response amplitude from ⫺4.3 ⫾ 0.8 na to ⫺1.5 ⫾ 0.6 na and
⫺0.9 ⫾ 0.3 na, respectively (fig. 4 a). when the phi was altered
by using different ph solutions in the recording pipettes, the
currents induced by icilin were clearly more sensitive to variations in phi than extracellular ph (fig. 4 a). once again, the
currents in response to 1 ␮m icilin were larger at higher phi values
and smaller at lower phi, with an estimated titration midpoint for
current size of ph 7.2, which is a value very near the phi in
physiological situations. the hill slope for the inhibitory action
of protons was 2.5, consistent with an action at several sites with

a cooperative inhibitory effect. the short
lag phase observed previously (fig. 1 d)
for icilin-evoked currents in pho 7.4 solutions was dependent on phi (fig. 4 b, d).
the latency progressively increased with
increasing acidification from ⬃10 sec in
the normal intracellular solution (ph 7.4)
until only two of five cells tested at phi 6.5
responded within 120 sec (fig. 4 b). unlike
the latency, the time course of the currents
did not appear to be affected by phi (fig.
4c). the current rise time, the time taken
for currents to grow from 10 to 90% of the
response, was similar at all phi values
(⬃2.5–3 sec; p ⬎ 0.05; anova), and the
current inactivation, which could be fitted
by a single exponential function, occurred
with a similar time course (␶ close to 2 sec;
p ⬎ 0.05; anova). consistent with the
previous experiments monitoring [ca 2⫹]i
levels, current responses to 1 mm menthol
were not significantly inhibited by phi 6.5
or potentiated by phi 8 (fig. 4 a) and also
developed without the latency observed
with icilin.
in light of the effects of phi, we were
interested in how incubation of cells in extracellular solutions of different ph affected phi. we examined this using the
ph-sensitive dye bcecf in a 96-well assay
format (fig. 4 e). the phi was monitored
for 5 min, and the pho was changed 20 sec
after starting the recording. the resting
phi of cho cells was 7.12 ⫾ 0.01 in an
external solution of ph 7.3 at 24°c. reducing the ph of the external solution below
7.3 evoked a time- and pho-dependent intracellular acidification such that phi was
reduced to ph 6.8 or below 2–5 min after
changing to external solutions of ph 5.7–
6.0 (fig. 4 e).

the threshold for cold activation is
modulated by ph
because responses to cold stimulation
(17°c) (fig. 2 d) and the potentiating effect of cooling on responses to low concentrations of menthol and icilin (fig. 3c)
were inhibited by low ph, we investigated
whether ph modulated the threshold for temperature activation
(fig. 5). groups of individual cells were exposed to a temperature
ramp (from 37 to ⬃12°c) in solutions of different pho. thresholds were determined by plotting logarithmic values of the
change in emission intensity ratios, log(⌬r), against temperature
(fig. 5a, inset). two lines were fitted to these plots, one before
and one after the cold-evoked [ca 2⫹]i responses developed, and
the intersection of these lines was regarded as the temperature
threshold. at physiological ph 7.3, the threshold for coldinduced [ca 2⫹]i responses determined in this way was 22.6 ⫾
0.7°c, but in more acidic solution the temperature threshold was
shifted to progressively lower values (fig. 5a). interestingly, alkaline conditions elevated the activation threshold. in solutions
of ph 8.1, [ca 2⫹]i responses developed with a threshold of

cold (fig. 5a). given the rather strong difference in sensitivity to phi and pho observed with icilin, we next examined the
effect of phi on inward currents induced
by cold (fig. 5 b, c). cells exposed to a
cooling ramp from 37 to ⬃8°c (holding

drgs (⬃28°c) (reid et al., 2002). the temperature– current relationship for cold-activated currents was very steep. furthermore, the temperature dependence was reduced by intracellular
acidification (fig. 5c). analysis of the recording performed at
phi 6.7 (fig. 5c) produced an apparent q10 of 40, but much
greater values were consistently seen for recordings performed at
higher phi. such high temperature dependence is hard to reconcile with a direct effect on the channel but would be consistent
with an indirect effect acting via a cascade system or another form
of amplification.
the temperature threshold for cold activation was strongly
elevated by the presence of a subactivating concentration of menthol or icilin (concentrations that did not evoke responses on
their own at 37°c). at low ph these synergistic effects on activation were not seen because cooling failed to elicit responses in the
presence of either agonist (fig. 3c). because menthol responses
are ph insensitive (fig. 3b), this effect must be on cold activation,
which fails to operate under acidic conditions even in the presence of menthol. the threshold for cold activation was considerably lower in the voltage-clamp experiments than in the [ca 2⫹]i
measurements (fig. 5 a, b). although the reason for this is not
known to us, it seems likely that this lower sensitivity to cold can
be explained by the assay conditions in voltage-clamp measurements, such as the membrane potential or dialysis of the cellular
contents by the pipette solution.
alkalosis (metabolic alkalosis and hypocapnic alkalosis) are
common clinical manifestations of many different etiologies
(galla, 2000; laffey and kavanagh, 2002). it has long been known
that alkalosis increases the excitability of central and drg neurons (that may lead to cramps and seizures among other symptoms) and increases the activity of voltage-operated calcium
channels (somjen and tombaugh, 1998; tombaugh and somjen,
1998). intracellular alkalinization strongly increases the affinity
of ins(1,4,5,)p3 for ins(1,4,5,)p3 receptors (worley et al., 1987)
and increases the release of ca 2⫹ through ins(1,4,5,)p3 receptors
as well as ryanodine receptors (joseph et al., 1989; heppner et al.,
2002). recently, experiments with vascular smooth muscle cells have
shown that raising phi activates a nonselective calcium-permeable
cation channel with properties resembling those of many trp channels, but of unknown identity (poteser et al., 2003). thus, different
pathways that can activate or potentiate trp or trp-like channels
and lead to increased [ca 2⫹]i share a common potentiation by elevated phi.
we found that not only menthol, but also icilin and intracellular alkalinization, elevate the temperature threshold for cold
activation of  xxxg2334xxx . trpv1 is often referred to as a polymodal
molecular sensor because its activity is regulated by stimuli of
different modalities. heat, low ph, and chemical ligands can all
gate trpv1 and also potentiate the effect of each other (tominaga et al., 1998). by similar criteria,  xxxg2334xxx  would qualify as a
polymodal molecular sensor, sensing temperature, ph, and
“cooling compounds.”
although it remains to be shown whether the ph effect observed here affects  xxxg2334xxx  in vivo, the pic50 values of 7.2 and 7.6
against icilin and cold are close to the phi under physiological
conditions, indicating that small changes in phi can affect cold
perception by regulating the excitability of  xxxg2334xxx -expressing
cold fibers. the inhibitory effect of protons applied intracellularly showed a steep concentration dependence, consistent with
an action at more than one site. as yet, it is unclear to us whether
these sites are intrinsic to the channel protein or not, but the fact
that menthol is resistant to the modulating effects of ph implies
that  xxxg2334xxx  can be activated by at least two distinct mechanisms.
