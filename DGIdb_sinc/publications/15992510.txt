cholesterol and plant sterol absorption: recent insights
klaus von bergmann, md,* thomas sudhop, md, and dieter lütjohann, phd
the recent discovery of transporters in the intestinal mucosa and the canalicular
membrane has given new insights into the regulation of intestinal absorption as well
as the biliary output of cholesterol and plant sterols. the 2  xxxd83xxx 
(atp)– binding cassette (abc) half-transporters abcg5 and abcg8 are expressed
in the mucosa cells and the canalicular membrane, and they resecrete sterols, especially absorbed plant sterols, back into the intestinal lumen and from the liver into
bile. defects of either of these cotransporters lead to the rare inherited disease of
phytosterolemia, which is clinically defined by hyperabsorption and diminished biliary excretion of plant sterols. furthermore, it has been recently demonstrated that
the niemann-pick c1-like 1 ( xxxg1583xxx ) transporter is most likely responsible for the
transport of cholesterol and plant sterols from the brush border membrane into the
intestinal mucosa. ezetimibe interferes with  xxxg1583xxx , reducing the intestinal uptake
of cholesterol and plant sterols. these new findings contribute to our understanding
of cholesterol and plant sterol concentrations in serum, and the effect of dietary and
drug intervention to reduce serum concentrations of sterols. © 2005 elsevier inc. all

cholesterol in the intestinal tract is derived from the diet and
bile. whereas dietary intake ranges from ⬍50 mg/day (pure
vegetarians) to 750 mg/day, biliary cholesterol input is 3 to 10
times higher and ranges from 500 to 2,400 mg/day.1 dietary
intake of plant sterols is of the same order of magnitude as
cholesterol and ranges from 200 to 400 mg/day.2
the chemical structures of plant sterols differ in several
aspects from that of cholesterol. plant sterols have either an
additional methyl or ethyl group at the carbon-24 position or
an additional double bond in the side chain (figure 1). plant
stanols, such as campestanol and sitostanol, differ from their
respective sterols by stereospecific saturation of the ⌬5
double bond leading to the 5␣-stanols.
serum concentrations of plant sterols are from 500
(campesterol) to 20,000 times (stigmasterol) less than that
of cholesterol (table 1). the concentrations of plant stanols
are even lower than their respective sterols (eg, campestanol
is 140 times less than campesterol, and sitostanol is 28 times
less than sitosterol). these large differences in serum concentrations are due to several differences in the metabolism
of plant sterols/stanols when compared with cholesterol: (1)
plant sterols are not synthesized in the human body and are
exclusively derived from the diet in different amounts, (2)
they are absorbed to a much lesser extent than cholesterol,
(3) they are probably not metabolized to bile acids, and (4)
they are excreted much faster from the liver into bile compared with cholesterol.3

intestinal absorption and biliary secretion
the intestinal absorption of plant sterols differs markedly
from that of cholesterol.4,5 on average, campesterol absorption is approximately 3 times lower than that of cholesterol,
and sitosterol is 3 times lower than that of campesterol,
whether measured by an intestinal perfusion4 or continuous
isotope feeding method.4,5 plasma sterols are also transported in serum with lipoproteins and excreted into bile. in
contrast with cholesterol, plant sterols are not metabolized
to bile acids in the liver,6 although previous studies have
indicated such a pathway.7 the biliary excretion rate of
plant sterols is opposite to their absorption rate: sitosterol is
excreted faster than campesterol, and campesterol is excreted faster than cholesterol.3 the reason for these differences in absorption and biliary elimination of sterols has
been recently identified. patients with the rare inherited
disease of phytosterolemia show hyperabsorption and diminished biliary secretion of cholesterol and plant sterols,
and they have tendon and tuberous xanthomas, premature
atherosclerosis, and coronary heart disease.8 the genetic
defect in phytosterolemia has been located to chromosome
2p21,9 and recent reports have identified mutations in 2
newly described adjacent  xxxd83xxx  (atp)–
binding cassette (abc) half-transporters, abcg5 and
abcg8.10,11
besides their absorption and biliary elimination, serum
concentrations of plant sterols also depend on serum lipoprotein metabolism. thus, in patients with  xxxg1318xxx , not only are the serum concentrations
of cholesterol significantly higher compared with normocholesterolemic controls, but those of the plant sterols/
stanols and cholesterol precursors are also significantly

higher (table 2). however, after correction for serum concentrations of cholesterol, the ratios of plant sterols and
cholesterol precursors no longer differ.
results from a previous study5 clearly show that differences among the absorption rates of sitosterol, campesterol,
and cholesterol in normocholesterolemic subjects and patients with phytosterolemia are almost identical (figure 2).
this has also been shown by yu et al12 in abcg5⫺/
abcg8⫺ knockout mice compared with wild-type animals,
indicating that the selectivity of the intestine for absorption
of different sterols is largely independent of abcg5 and
abcg8 cotransporters. therefore, other genes besides
abcg5/g8 presumably influence plasma plant sterol levels.
indeed, sehayek et al13 have found linkages on chromosome
14 in a specific mouse strain. thus, several different mechanisms are responsible for plant sterol concentrations in
normal subjects and patients with phytosterolemia.

ezetimibe
the discovery of ezetimibe, which reduces intestinal cholesterol absorption in animals and humans, has provided
new insights into the metabolism of plant sterols. treatment

treatment (table 3),14 suggesting that ezetimibe also reduces the absorption of plant sterols. the reduction of plant
sterols was significantly more pronounced than the reduction of serum cholesterol. furthermore, the percent reduction of plant sterols differed with respect to side chain
length (methyl or ethyl group) and the double bond at ⌬5,
and in the side chain (table 3). a possible explanation for
this difference might be their different absorption and biliary elimination rates. in patients with phytosterolemia, the
reduction of sitosterol and campesterol after 2 weeks of
treatment with ezetimibe was less than in hypercholesterolemic subjects; campesterol and sitosterol decreased by
18.9% and 16.0%, respectively (p ⬍0.0001).15 because the
absorption rates of campesterol and sitosterol are significantly higher in patients with phytosterolemia, the smaller
reduction was probably caused by slower biliary elimination. the least reduction was observed for the 2 stanols,
campestanol and sitostanol (table 3). possibly, the smaller
reduction of campestanol and sitostanol could be because
both stanols are partly metabolites of their respective sterols. in animal studies, sitosterol can be metabolized to
sitostanol.16
the uptake of cholesterol and other sterols into the
intestinal mucosa is a rapid process.17 within 15 minutes
after administration of an equimolar mixture of cholesterol and plant sterols/stanols, all sterols were detected in

the intestinal mucosa, with no difference in the concentration of cholesterol and campesterol (figure 3). the
difference between cholesterol and plant sterols/stanols
increased rapidly with time and decreased depending on
the side chain length and ⌬5 double bond, suggesting that
plant sterols are rapidly resecreted into the intestinal
lumen by abcg5 and abcg8 transporters. the reasons
why plant sterols are taken up by the intestinal mucosa
and then resecreted into the intestine remains unclear.
because the 2 abcg5/abcg8 transporters are also
present in the liver, it is not surprising that plant sterols
are secreted much faster into bile than cholesterol.3 in
mouse experiments performed by igel et al,17 the concentration of sitosterol in bile was higher compared with
campesterol 2 hours after gastric administration of the

sterol mixture. likewise, the concentration of campesterol was higher than that of cholesterol.
the recent finding that the niemann-pick c1-like 1
( xxxg1583xxx ) protein in the brush border membrane plays a
major role in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and most
likely of plant sterols has given new insights into the overall
sterol pathway in the intestine.18 however, in npc1 null
mice, cholesterol absorption averaged 15.6%, indicating
that additional mechanisms are involved in the uptake of
sterols into the mucosa cells. recent data suggest that
ezetimibe binds to the  xxxg1583xxx  protein,19 thereby inhibiting
cholesterol and plant sterol absorption. although the results
on ezetimibe in niemann-pick knockout mice are convincing, kramer et al20 have expressed doubts whether the
 xxxg1583xxx  protein is the sole transporter for these sterols and

suggest that other proteins, such as  xxxg163xxx , are a

conclusion
the discovery of transporters in the intestinal mucosa cells
and hepatocytes has given new insights into the regulation
of the intestinal absorption and biliary secretion of sterols
(figure 4). ezetimibe, a potent and selective inhibitor of
intestinal absorption of cholesterol and plant sterols, lowers
serum cholesterol and plant sterols. the reduction in plant
sterols shown in patients with phytosterolemia in a recent
study15 suggests that ezetimibe might be of benefit in the
long-term treatment of these patients.
