abstract
we studied the interaction of s-methylisothiourea (a selective  xxxg1578xxx  inhibitor) with rofecoxib (selective
 xxxg1884xxx  inhibitor) and  xxxd2556xxx  (non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor) in brewer’s yeast-induced pyrexia in mice by
isobolographic analysis. each drug was effective in reducing pyrexia when used alone. log–dose–response curves of all the three drugs did
not show any significant departure from parallelism indicating thereby, a common mode of antipyretic action. however, rofecoxib exhibited
significantly higher potency than s-methylisothiourea. isobolographic analysis of combination of s-methylisothiourea with rofecoxib and
 xxxd2556xxx  revealed additive interaction. experimental ed50 of the combinations was not significantly different from theoretical additive
ed50 of the corresponding drug combination, that substantiated the additive nature of interaction between  xxxg1578xxx  and
cyclooxygenase in brewer’s yeast-induced fever in mice. results suggest involvement of a mediator that is subservient to both inducible
 xxxd2738xxx  synthase and  xxxg1884xxx  enzyme activities. for further investigation, peroxynitrite ion may be considered to be the
putative mediator.

1. introduction
realizing the significance of inducible  xxxd2738xxx 
synthase (inos) and  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) in inflammation, a number of investigations were carried out to
unravel the roles of these enzymes in the production of
fever. injection of lg-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (a nonspecific nos inhibitor) directly into the circulation was
reported to attenuate lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced
fever in rats (scammel et al., 1996). in another study,
 xxxd2951xxx  and s-methylisothiourea (both predominant
inhibitors of inos) were shown to produce dose-dependent

attenuation of lps-induced fever in guinea pigs (roth et al.,
1999). same workers had earlier reported the role of nitric
oxide in  xxxd2374xxx -induced fever in rats (roth et al.,
1998a). in spite of majority of studies indicating the
involvement of  xxxd2738xxx  in the production of fever,
reports suggesting antipyretic roles for  xxxd2738xxx  do exist
in literature. pharmacological evidence that  xxxd2738xxx  can
act as an endogenous antipyretic factor in endotoxininduced fever in rabbits was put forth long before (gourine,
1995). role of  xxxd2738xxx  as an antipyretic in endotoxininduced fever in rabbits was subsequently substantiated
(riedel, 1997). studies conducted on gene knock-out mice
have revealed differential roles of nos isoforms in the fever
of different etiologies (kozak and kozak, 2003). like that
of prostaglandins, species differences in the role of nitric
oxide cannot be ruled out. for instance,  xxxd2738xxx  has

138

a.-s. bhat et al. / european journal of pharmacology 511 (2005) 137–142

been found to have no modulatory effect on fever in cats
(redford et al., 1995).
 xxxg1884xxx , the inducible isoform of the enzyme
prostaglandin h synthase, has been reported to mediate the
febrile response of mice to  xxxd2374xxx  (li et al.,
2001). mice expressing the transgenic cox-2 in anterior
hypothalamus revealed accelerated onset of fever in
response to lps compared to their non-transgenic counterparts (vidensky et al., 2003). lps-induced fever in rats has
been reported to be associated with induction of cox-2
mrna in the blood vessels and leptomeninges (cao et al.,
1997). although the role of nos and cox pathways in
pyrogenic fever has been studied in rabbit and rat (lin and
lin, 1996; vayssettes-courchay et al., 2002), yet it is not
completely understood whether inos and cox-2 produce
fever independent of each other or the two pathways partly
contribute to some common mechanism in this aspect.
therefore, a study was planned to explore the nature of
interaction between inos and cox-2 using s-methylisothiourea (selective inos inhibitor), rofecoxib (selective
cox-2 inhibitor) and  xxxd2556xxx  (non-selective cox
inhibitor) as experimental tools in brewer’s yeast-induced
pyrexia in mice.

2. materials and methods
2.1. animals
this experiment was completed in five phases and
accordingly five batches of adult male albino mice weighing
between 25 and 30 g were procured from the laboratory
animal resource section of the institute. these mice were
housed at controlled temperature (22f2 8c) and allowed
free access to food and drinking water. the animals were
acclimatized for a day before the actual experiment was
conducted.
2.2. drugs
rofecoxib gifted by branbaxy laboratories india,q smethylisothiourea as its hemisulfate salt and  xxxd2556xxx 
acid procured from bsigma chemical usaq were used in
this study. s-methylisothiourea dissolved in distilled water,
 xxxd2556xxx  dissolved in equimolar sodium hydroxide
solution and rofecoxib in the form of aqueous suspension in
1% tween-80 were orally administered to the experimental
animals for plotting the dose–response curves.
2.3. induction of pyrexia
after recording the rectal temperature of each of the
animal in a batch, pyrexia was induced by subcutaneous
injection of 20% brewer’s yeast suspension in the neck
scruff @10 ml /kg body weight in the afternoon around 4.00
pm (kupeli et al., 2002). animals were fasted and 18 h later,

on the following day, rectal temperature of each animal was
recorded by use of a digital thermometer. the mice
exhibiting a rise in temperature by more than 0.8 8c were
considered as pyretic.
2.4. recording of dose–response curve
the study involved recording of five dose–response
curves, each for s-methylisothiourea, rofecoxib,  xxxd2556xxx 
acid and combinations of s-methylisothiourea plus rofecoxib and s-methylisothiourea plus  xxxd2556xxx .
recording of dose–response curve for each drug involved
use of 36 animals divided randomly into six groups of six
each. five groups of animals were subjected to induction of
pyrexia by brewer’s yeast, whereas one group served as
naive control. out of five pyretic groups, four groups were
administered 4 different dose levels of the drug in question,
whereas one group served as vehicle-treated pyretic control.
thus, for three drugs 363=108 animals were used in three
phases. in a similar way, for recording the dose–response
curve for each drug combination, out of five groups of six
mice each, one group served as naive control, one served as
vehicle-treated pyretic control and the remaining three
groups were administered three different dose levels of the
drug combination in question. recording of dose–response
curves for drug combinations involved use of 60 mice in
total, using 30 mice for each drug combination. thus, whole
experiment was completed on 168 mice in five batches and
each batch of animals had its own contemporary vehicletreated pyretic and naive controls. rectal temperature was
recorded at 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7 h after the drug administration.
for calculating the net response to a given dose of the drug
in question over a period of 7 h, we computed an average
for 1-, 3-, 5- and 7-h temperature records for each animal.
the antipyretic efficacy (%) for a given dose of drug ,alone
or in combination was calculated by using the formula:
% efficacy ¼ ½ðaverage temperature of vehicle treated pyretic controlþ
 ðaverage temperature of drug treated groupþ
=½ðaverage temperature of vehicle treated pyretic controlþ
 ðaverage temperature of naive controlþ  100

2.5. isobolographic analysis
the interaction of s-methylisothiourea with the given
cox inhibitors was evaluated by simultaneous administration of fixed proportions of s-methylisothiourea with
each cox inhibitor, and performing an isobolographic
analysis as described by tallarida et al. (1997). the
isobologram was constructed by connecting the ed50 of
the corresponding cox inhibitor, plotted on the abscissa
with the ed50 of s-methylisothiourea plotted on the ordinate
to obtain the additivity line. for each drug combination,
ed50, ed25 and ed12.5 and the associated 95% confidence
intervals were determined by linear regression analysis of
the log–dose–response curve (6 animals at each dose) and

139

compared by dtt-test to the theoretical additive ed50, ed25
and ed12.5. for interaction studies, fixed-ratio proportions
were selected by first combining the ed50 of each
compound and then constructing a dose–response curve in
which ed50 fractions (1/2, 1/4 and 1/8) of inos–cox
inhibitor combinations were administered. theoretical
additive ed50, ed25 and ed12.5 of the combinations were
determined by combining together 1/2 ed50 (e.g., 1/2 ed50
s-methylisothiourea+1/2 ed50 cox inhibitor), 1/2 ed25, 1/
2 ed12.5 and 1/2 ed6.25 of each drug and then following the
linear regression analysis.

from the individual variances, 95% confidence limits
were calculated for theoretical additive combinations. when
the drug combination gives an experimental ed50 not
statistically different from theoretically calculated ed50,
the interaction is said to be additive. additivity means each
constituent contributes to the effect according to its own
potency and the less potent drug is acting as if it is merely a
diluted fraction of the other (tallarida, 2001).
slopes of individual log–dose–response curves were
compared by student’s dt-testt and theoretical additive line
was compared to experimental combination lines by
analysis of covariance as described by tallarida et al.
(1997). theoretical effective doses were compared with
experimental effective doses by student’s dtt-test.

found in vehicle-treated pyretic control. per os administration of s-methylisothiourea, rofecoxib and  xxxd2556xxx 
acid produced dose-dependent antipyretic effect in brewer’s yeast-induced pyrexia in mice, with different potencies. peak antipyretic effect in s-methylisothiourea and
rofecoxib treated animals was observed after 3 h of drug
administration, whereas  xxxd2556xxx  administered
animals exhibited the peak antipyretic effect after 1 h of
the drug administration. since the duration of antipyretic
effect was about 7 h with each treatment, it was
appropriate to calculate mean of 1-, 3-, 5- and 7-h
temperatures for assessing the per cent efficacy of the
drug in question. the dose–response data obtained for
each drug alone and in combination, respectively are
presented in tables 1 and 2. slopes of the dose–response
curves of s-methylisothiourea, rofecoxib and  xxxd2556xxx 
acid were 76.40f5.75; 46.40f9.80 and 53.50f9.60,
respectively and were not statistically different from one
another. ed50 values (mg/kg body weight) of s-methylisothiourea, rofecoxib and  xxxd2556xxx  were calculated
to be 41.70f2.90; 1.79f0.61 and 8.20f2.10, respectively.

with rofecoxib and s-methylisothiourea with  xxxd2556xxx 
acid are summarized in table 3. for either of the drug
combination comparison of theoretical and experimentally
derived lines using analysis of covariance technique
indicated similarity in both slopes and intercepts.
antipyretic activity induced by co-administration of
fixed ratios of ed50 fractions of cox inhibitors and smethylisothiourea was examined by the analysis of corresponding isobolograms. the effective doses for the response
levels of 50%, 25% and 12.5% and their 95% confidence
intervals are shown in table 4. isobolographic analysis for
the combinations of s-methylisothiourea+rofecoxib and smethylisothiourea+ xxxd2556xxx  revealed additive interaction as represented in fig. 1a and b. in isobolograms,
interaction is additive because 95% confidence interval of
experimental ed50 of the combination overlapped the 95%
confidence interval of theoretical ed50 of the corresponding
drug combination.

4. discussion
in brewer’s yeast-induced pyrexia in rodents, yeast cell
wall products deposited subcutaneously act as exogenous
pyrogens and stimulate the immune cells (macrophages
and lymphocytes) to produce endogenous pyrogens in the

form of cytokines in the circulation that go to anterior
hypothalamus to alter the set point for body temperature
(miller, 2000). in the present study, all animals demonstrated pyrexia in response to brewer’s yeast. a dosedependent antipyretic effect produced by s-methylisothiourea indicates that induction of inducible isoform of
nos in response to endogenous pyrogens is involved in
the generation of pyrexia by the yeast cells. such
observations have also been reported in guinea pigs
wherein s-methylisothiourea and  xxxd2951xxx  produced
a dose-dependent attenuation of lipopolysaccharideinduced fever (roth et al., 1999). rofecoxib and  xxxd2556xxx  also produced dose-dependent antipyretic
effects in mice in this model. this substantiates the role
of  xxxg1884xxx  in yeast-induced fever in mice,
because rofecoxib specifically inhibits cox-2 and  xxxd2556xxx  non-specifically inhibits cox. it is already
reported that cox-2 isoform mediates febrile response of
mice to  xxxd2374xxx  and cox-2 has predominant
role in lipopolysaccharide-induced fever in rats (li et al.,
2001; zhang et al., 2003). therefore, it is inferred from the
dose–response curves that inos and cox-2 are involved
in pyrexia in response to brewer’s yeast.
such inference is not surprising, since there are
evidences that inducing insults for inos and cox-2 being
similar, result in co-induction of these two enzymes

the most remarkable point, however, is the parallelism of
the three dose–response curves as the slopes were not
significantly different from one another. applying the
principles of biological assay, one can safely infer that
some common mechanism is involved in the control of fever
by s-methylisothiourea and rofecoxib or  xxxd2556xxx  in
spite of the fact that these drugs inhibit different enzymes
and hence, the production of different mediators. in other
words, there occurs some cross-talk between inos and
cox-2, finally leading to the generation of fever by some
common pathway. it is already known that attenuation of
fever by inos inhibitors is independent of the circulating
cytokine network (roth et al., 1998b). further, fever
originates by central nervous system activities, but neither
exogenous nor endogenous pyrogens are able to cross the
blood brain barrier. it is, therefore, certain that some freely
diffusible molecular species must be acting as mediator for
genesis of fever in response to yeast. from the last few

years, search is being made to unravel the putative role of
reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen oxide species as
signalling molecules in the genesis of fever. it has recently
been propounded that oxidative stress is being sensed by
redox-sensitive site of the n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor for
glutamate followed by oxidation of the site and development of fever (nomoto et al., 2004). this is based on the
observation that oxygen radical scavengers and thiol
reductants act as antipyretics. inhibition of oxygen radical
formation by  xxxd2610xxx , aspirin, or a- xxxd2494xxx  has
been reported to prevent bacterial lipopolysaccharideinduced fever not only in rabbits (riedel et al., 2003) but
also in pigeons (nomoto and riedel, 2004).
from the findings of our experiment, it seems true that
inos and cox-2 complement each other in such a manner,
that inhibition of either of the two systems prevents
development of fever. this is because s-methylisothiourea,
rofecoxib and  xxxd2556xxx  when given alone could
effectively reduce fever and that too with 100% efficacy. it
has been shown that inos inhibition blocks prostanoid
production by 50% in rats, thereby signifying the regulatory
influence of  xxxd2738xxx  on cox (salvemini et al., 1995).
further, inos–cox pathways were also explored for their
possible role in pyrogenic fever in rabbits (lin and lin,
1996), but the design of this study has been such that the
individual roles of inos and cox-2 have been well
ascertained without addressing the nature of their interaction. however, the present study is based on isobolograms and comparison of composite additive curve with
experimental combination curve is considered as the
efficient design for assessing the nature of interaction
(tallarida et al., 1997; tallarida, 2001). isobolographic
analysis revealed no significant departure of experimentally
derived ed50 from the theoretically additive ed50 for both
s-methylisothiourea+rofecoxib and s-methylisothiourea+ xxxd2556xxx  combinations. this is possible only if nitric
oxide and prostanoids follow an additive type of interaction
in yeast-induced pyrexia in mice. but, this cannot be
achieved unless the production of signaling mediator
molecules is subservient to both inos and cox-2. therefore, from this study, it is concluded that interaction
between inos and cox-2 is complementary and additive
in nature. however, further investigations are required to
ascertain whether peroxynitrite ion (onoo), that is
usually formed by the rapid reaction of  xxxd2738xxx  with
even low concentrations of superoxide anion (o2), does or

does not function as a signalling molecule in the generation
of fever.
