background & aims: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (nsaids) have well-characterized inhibitory effects on gastric ulcer healing. a new class of gastrointestinal-sparing,  xxxd2738xxx -releasing nsaid derivatives has been recently described. this study was
performed to determine if one of these compounds (nitrofenac) would influence healing of a preexisting ulcer.
methods: seven days after induction of gastric ulcer
with serosal acetic acid, daily oral treatment with antiinflammatory doses of diclofenac, nitrofenac, or vehicle
was started. after 7 days of treatment, the ulcer area
was measured. the effects of misoprostol and two
drugs that show in vitro selectivity for inhibiting
 xxxg1884xxx  ( xxxd2688xxx  and l745,337) were
also assessed. results: diclofenac,  xxxd2688xxx , and
l745,337 had no effect on ulcer healing when compared with vehicle. only diclofenac significantly decreased hematocrit and weight gain. on the other hand,
nitrofenac significantly accelerated healing. glyceryl
trinitrate also significantly and dose dependently accelerated healing. nitrofenac suppressed cyclooxygenase
1 activity to a similar extent as diclofenac. conclusions: these results show that an no-releasing nsaid
derivative and an no donor could accelerate ulcer healing, whereas a standard nsaid, misoprostol, and two
inhibitors of  xxxg1884xxx  had no effect. in addition
to sparing the gastrointestinal tract, no-releasing
nsaids, despite suppressing cyclooxygenase activity,
are capable of accelerating tissue repair.

'n addition to the ulcerogenic effects on the gastroin.testinal tract exerted by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), the use of these drugs is limited
by their ability to interfere with the healing of ulcers.
this phenomenon has been well documented both in
humans 1'2 and in experimental models of gastric ulcer in
the rat. 3-5 this effect of nsaids presents a dilemma in
terms of the treatment of patients with arthritis who
develop a gastric or duodenal ulcer because the delaying
effect of the nsaid on ulcer healing and the possibility

i

that this could lead to life-threatening hemorrhage usually require the patient to cease taking the nsaid.
numerous strategies have been used in recent years to
develop new anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs
that spare the gastrointestinal tract. several groups
are attempting to develop nsaids that only inhibit
the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase (cox) 2,
thereby exerting anti-inflammatory activity but sparing
gastrointestinal prostaglandin synthesis. 6-8 cox-2 is believed to be expressed only at sites of inflammation,
whereas cox-1 is constitutively expressed in many tissues, including the gastrointestinal mucosa and the platelet. 6'7 the prostaglandins derived from cox-1 are believed to be responsible for many of the physiological
effects of these autacoids, including maintenance of gastric mucosal integrity. 6'7 effects of cox-2 inhibitors on
the healing of preexisting gastrointestinal ulcers have
not been reported, but because such ulcers usually have
surrounding inflammation, it is possible that this isoform
of cox may be expressed and may be producing prostaglandins that contribute to the healing process.
another strategy for developing gastrointestinal-sparing nsaids is the coupling of a  xxxd2738xxx -releasing
moiety to standard nsaids. 9-1. the rationale behind
this strategy is that the no released from these derivatives will exert beneficial effects on the mucosa by maintaining gastrointestinal blood flow and inhibiting adherence and activation (i.e., release of reactive oxygen
metabolites and proteases) of white blood cells within
the gastrointestinal microcirculation. 9'1° both a reduction
in gastrointestinal blood flow and stimulation of leukocyte adherence and activation have been implicated in
the pathogenesis ofnsaid gastropathy, at least in experimental models. 11 the effects of these compounds in
models of preexisting gastric ulcers have not yet been
assessed, although they have been shown to have reduced
toxicity vs. standard nsaids in a rat model of colitis. 12

animals
male wistar rats weighing 1 7 5 - 2 0 0 g were obtained
from charles river breeding farms ltd. (montreal, quebec,
canada) and were housed in polycarbonate cages. the rats had
free access to standard pellet chow and tap water throughout
the experiment with the exception of some experiments (see
below) in which the rats were deprived of food, but not water,
for 1 8 - 2 2 hours before the experiment was performed. all
experimental protocols were approved by the animal care
committee of the university of calgary.

induction of ulcers
ulcers were induced using a modified version of the
methods of w a n g et al. 3 briefly, rats were anesthetized with
halothane, and a laparotomy was performed. the barrel of a
3-ml syringe, which had been cut and then filed smooth, was
applied to the serosal wall of the stomach, and 0.5 ml of 80%
(vol/vol) acetic acid was instilled into the syringe barrel so that
it made contact with the serosa. after 60 seconds, the acetic
acid was removed by aspiration and the region to which it had
been applied was washed with sterile saline. the area exposed
to acetic acid was 59.7 m m 2. in pilot studies, we observed
considerable variability in the size of ulcers during the first
week after application of acetic acid but, by day 7, the ulcer
size was consistent. for this reason, studies of the effects of
various drugs on ulcer healing were started on the seventh day
after induction of ulcers.

mg/kg; equimolar to the dose of diclofenac),  xxxd2688xxx  (75
mg/kg), or l745,337 (5 mg/kg). control rats were treated
with the same volume of the vehicle. the test drugs were
initially dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx  and then diluted in
1% carboxymethylcellulose such that the final concentration
of  xxxd1896xxx  was 5%. the doses of the test drugs
were selected because they have been shown to exhibit antiinflammatory effects in previous studies, s'9'ls in addition, the
dose of diclofenac was selected because, in previous studies
performed in our laboratory, higher doses of this drug resulted
in a high rate of mortality when given repeatedly during the
period of a week. 12 the drugs were given every 24 hours for
the next 7 days, and the rats were killed 24 hours after the
final dose of the drugs. the stomach was removed and pinned
on a wax block. a paper grid with an area of 25 m m 2 was
placed alongside the ulcer, which was then photographed. the
ulcer area was then determined by planimetry using 5 × enlargements of the photographs. the area of ulceration in pixels
was converted to units of square millimeters using the paper
grid as a reference. all planimetric determinations were performed using coded photographs such that the observer was
blinded to the treatment the rats had received. sections of the
affected region of the stomach were fixed in neutral buffered
formalin and processed by routine techniques for light microscopy (h&e staining). the slides were coded to avoid observer
bias. a blood sample was drawn from a tail vein at the beginning and end of the study for determination of hematocrit.
body weight was measured daily throughout the study.
to confirm that the test compounds were bioavailable after
oral administration, separate groups of 5 rats were each treated
orally with the test compounds at the same doses as above or
with an identical volume (1 ml/kg) of the vehicle. three hours
later, the rats were anesthetized with halothane, and a 1-ml
blood sample was drawn from the descending aorta. thromb o x a n e g 2 synthesis by the blood was determined using a
method described in detail previously. 19 thromboxane b 2 is
the stable hydration product of thromboxane a2, which is
produced by platelets through the enzyme cox-1. 6

effects of an no donor
to determine if an no-generating compound would alter
the healing of gastric ulcers, as has been reported previously, t6
we tested the effects of daily oral administration of glyceryl
trinitrate or the same volume (1 ml/kg) of the vehicle (water)
from day 7 to day 14 postinduction of ulcers.  xxxd2741xxx  was tested at the same dose previously reported to accelerate ulcer healing (10 mg/rat) 16 and at lower doses (1 and 0.1
mg/rat). ulcer area, body weight, and hematocrit level were
measured as above.

effects of misoprostol
effects of prostaglandin synthase
inhibitors
on the seventh day after induction of ulcers, the rats
were weighed and then given one of the following drugs orally
(1 ml/kg by garage): diclofenac (5 mg/kg), nitrofenac (7.5

rats were treated daily with the  xxxd124xxx  analogue, misoprostol (0.01 mg/rat in 0.25 ml per os), from days
7 to 14 after induction of gastric ulcers with acetic acid. as
in the above experiments, ulcer area was determined on day
14. control rats were treated with the same volume of vehicle.

elliott et al.

this dose of misoprostol was selected because it has previously
been shown in studies performed in this laboratory to prevent
the gastropathy that develops in a rat model of portal hypertension secondary to biliary cirrhosis. 2° on a per kilogram basis
( ~ 5 0 btg/kg), it is a very similar dose to the 33 btg/kg used
by penney et al. 14 in a study in which they showed accelerated
ulcer healing in the rat when coadministered with aspirin
during a 2-week period.

effects on acid secretion
any effect of the test drugs on ulcer healing could be
attributable to effects on gastric acid secretion because inhibition of acid secretion has been shown to lead to accelerated
healing in experimental gastric ulcer models. 3'4 we tested the
effects of diclofenac (5 mg/kg), nitrofenac (equimolar dose, 7.5
mg/kg), and  xxxd2741xxx  (10 mg/rat) on gastric acid
secretion in rats in which an ulcer had previously been induced.
we also examined acid secretion in rats with and without a
preexisting ulcer who had then received oral vehicle instead
of one of the test drugs. ulcers were induced as described
above. seven days later, these rats and the group of rats in
which ulcers were not induced were deprived of food, but not
water, overnight. each test group consisted of 5 rats. the rats
were given vehicle or one of the test drugs orally. two hours
later, the rats were anesthetized with urethane (25%; 6 ml/
kg), a laparotomy was performed, and the pylorus was ligated.
two hours later, the stomach was excised after clamping the
esophagus to prevent leakage of the contents, and the gastric
juice was collected into test tubes. the volume of the gastric
juice was recorded and the concentration of acid determined
by titration to p h 7.0 using a metrohm automated titrator
(brinkmann instruments, rexdale, ontario, canada). total
acid output was then calculated in units of microequivalents.

statistical analysis
all data are expressed as the mean + sem. comparisons between groups of data were made using a one-way analysis of data followed by a student-newman-keuls post hoc
test. an associated probability of < 5 % was considered significant.

weeks. histologically, the ulcers observed 7 - 1 4 days
after acetic acid administration were characterized by a
thick layer of granulation tissue with evidence of glandular disorganization at the ulcer margins. these lesions
involved the full thickness of the mucosa and penetrated
t h r o u g h the muscularis mucosae. in some instances, the
ulceration extended into the muscularis propria. perforation was not observed during the course of the study.
mean ulcer area at day 7 after acetic acid application was
34.1 -+ 6.4 m m 2 (n = 10), and this had decreased (p =
0.055) to a mean of 22.5 __+ 2.5 m m 2 (n = 40) at day
14 in rats treated only with vehicle.
daily administration of diclofenac from days 7 to 14
after ulcer induction did not significantly alter ulcer area
(figure 1). histologically, the ulcers in rats treated with
diclofenac were indistinguishable from those in rats
treated with vehicle. o n the other hand, daily treatment
with nitrofenac resulted in a significant acceleration of
ulcer healing because ulcer areas, which were confirmed
histologically, were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced
compared with both the vehicle-treated and diclofenactreated groups (figure 1). whereas complete healing of
ulcers was not observed with nitrofenac treatment during
a period of 1 week, ulcer areas were reduced to as little
as 1.5 m m 2.
n e i t h e r diclofenac nor nitrofenac produced macroscopically visible damage to the small intestine or to
regions of the stomach other than the site of ulcer induction by acetic acid. however, diclofenac administration
resulted in a significant attenuation of the rate of body
weight increase compared with the other two groups

had no effect on the healing of gastric ulcers (figure 3).
these drugs had no effect on the rate of body weight
gain or on hematocrit level when compared with the
vehicle-treated group (data not shown).
blood thromboxane b2 synthesis was measured to provide an index of the bioavailability of the various test
drugs and an index of their effects on cox-1 activity.
as shown in figure 3, all of the test drugs significantly
inhibited thromboxane b2 production at the doses used
in the studies on ulcer healing. there were no significant
differences among the test drugs in terms of their effects
on thromboxane synthesis.
daily treatment with misoprostol failed to significantly alter the rate of gastric ulcer healing (figure 4).
however, daily treatment with  xxxd2741xxx  resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the size of gastric
ulcers when examined at the end of the 1-week treatment
period (figure 4). at the highest dose of  xxxd2741xxx  tested (10 rag/rat), complete healing of the gastric
ulcers (confirmed histologically) was observed in 4 of
the 6 rats. neither  xxxd2741xxx  nor misoprostol
significantly affected the rate of weight gain or the hematocrit level (data not shown).
to determine if the accelerated healing of ulcers observed
when rats were treated with nitrofenac or  xxxd2741xxx 
was attributable to suppression of gastric acid secretion,
experiments were performed to determine if these drugs
exerted such effects in pylorus-ligated rats. acid secretion
was significantly higher in rats with preexisting acetic acid
ulcers that were treated with diclofenac or nitrofenac when
compared with rats without preexisting ulcers that were
treated only with vehicle (table 1). however, among the
groups of rats with preexisting ulcers, none of the test drugs
significantly affected gastric acid secretion.

(figure 2). moreover, hematocrit level decreased significantly (p < 0.001) during the course of 7 days of treatment with diclofenac, whereas it was unaffected in the

bleeding, most likely from the small intestine (although
bleeding from the gastric ulcer or anemia unrelated to
gastrointestinal bleeding cannot be ruled out).

discussion
the retarding effects of nsaids on gastric ulcer
healing are thought to be attributable to the suppression
of gastric prostaglandin synthesis by these agents and
possibly their topical irritant properties. 14,15some studies
have shown that administration of exogenous prostaglandins, such as misoprostol, can prevent the development
or accelerate the healing of nsaid-induced gastric ulcers. 21'22 o n the other hand, some studies suggest that
healing of ulcers by exogenous prostaglandins is impaired
if nsaid use is uninterrupted. 23 despite this controversy, there is general agreement that better therapies
for accelerating ulcer healing or new nsaids that spare
the gastric mucosa would be valuable tools in the therapy
of inflammatory conditions, particularly in patients prone
to ulceration.
in the present study, we have shown that healing

of experimental gastric ulcers can be accelerated by an
no-releasing nsaid derivative or by an no donor
( xxxd2741xxx ). a standard nsaid (diclofenac)
and two nsaids reported to have greater selectivity
for cox-2 8'17 had no effect on ulcer healing in this
study. the acceleration of healing observed with the
no-releasing nsaid (nitrofenac) occurred despite the
fact that this compound inhibits cox-1 and cox-2
as effectively as the parent nsaid diclofenac.9'1°'13
determination of thromboxane production by blood
confirmed that each of the nsaids tested in this study
significantly suppressed cox-1 activity because platelet thromboxane is mediated through this isoform of
the prostaglandin synthase enzyme. 6 the acceleration
of healing by nitrofenac and  xxxd2741xxx  did not
seem to be attributable to effects of these agents on
gastric acid secretion because neither drug significantly affected rates of acid secretion, at least during

the first 4 hours of their administration. it remains a
possibility that these drugs exerted a delayed inhibitory effect on acid secretion. the absence of a significant beneficial effect of misoprostol on ulcer healing
in the present study is consistent with the observations
of penney et al., ~4 who found that a similar dose of
misoprostol significantly reduced ulcer size when administered concomitantly with aspirin during a 2week period but not when administered during a 1week period.
these findings are consistent with the hypothesis
that n o is capable of accelerating ulcer healing. konturek et a1.16 previously showed that  xxxd2741xxx 
was capable of accelerating ulcer healing using the
same model as in the present study. moreover, they
showed that suppression of endogenous n o synthesis
led to impaired ulcer healing. nitrofenac and the other
no-releasing nsaids have been shown to have several
effects consistent with their releasing no in vivo and
in vitro. for example, plasma nitrate and nitrite levels
increase significantly within an hour of administration
of these compoundsg'l°; gastric blood flow is maintained after administration of an no-releasing
nsaid, whereas it decreases after administration of
the native nsaidi°; and leukocyte adherence to mesenteric venules is observed after administration of an
nsaid but not the no-releasing nsaid derivative. 9
furthermore, no-releasing nsaids increase intracellular  xxxd1274xxx  levels within
cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells 24 and
platelets (unpublished data, march 1995).
the mechanisms through which n o promotes ulcer
healing are not entirely clear. it is now well established
that no is an important mediator of gastric mucosal
defense, modulating mucosal blood flow25 and mucus
secretion. 26 thus, it is possible that n o accelerates
ulcer healing by elevating the resistance of the mucosa
at the ulcer margin to further damage. because various
growth factors have been shown to modulate ulcer
healing 2v'28 and the receptors for some growth factors
(e.g.,  xxxg681xxx ) are expressed in much
greater numbers at sites of ulceration, 29 it is possible
that n o exerts its effects by modulating the production of action of these factors. it is also possible that
n o directly stimulates ulcer repair. as well as being
shown to promote ulcer healing in the present study
and previously, 16 n o has been shown to promote the
growth of intestinal smooth muscle in a rat model of
colitis) ° these possible mechanisms through which
no promotes ulcer healing require further study.
unlike many previous studies, we did not observe an
impairment of ulcer healing in the present study with

no-releasing nsaids and ulcer healing

529

the nsaid diclofenac. this difference from previous
studies may be related to the different nsaid used because earlier studies used either indomethacin or aspirin 3'4'14 or may be related to the dose of diclofenac we
selected, which does not completely suppress gastric
prostaglandin synthesis, l° or to the duration of administration of the drug. the selection of the dose of diclofenac
used in the present study was based on earlier studies in
which significant small intestinal damage was observed
with higher doses, frequently leading to perforation and
death. 12 even with the dose of diclofenac used (5 mg/
kg), we observed a significant depression of body weight
gain and a significant decrease in hematocrit level. although we cannot rule out the possibility that this was
caused by bleeding from the gastric ulcers or was unrelated to bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, it seems
more likely to be attributable to small intestinal lesions
that were not macroscopically detectable.
it is interesting that the two reportedly selective cox2 inhibitors,  xxxd2688xxx  and l745,337, did not affect
ulcer healing rates in this study. these drugs suppressed
cox-1 activity (thromboxane synthesis) as effectively as
diclofenac at the doses used. these doses were selected
because, in previous studies (chan et al., manuscript in
preparation), 8'1v they were reported to exert approximately equivalent anti-inflammatory activity ( ~ 50% inhibition of carrageenan-induced paw edema) to what we
observed with diclofenac and nitrofenac at the doses
used) ° thus, although these drugs have been shown to
have greater in vitro selectivity for the inducible isoform
of prostaglandin synthase (cox-2), say'31 the doses required for anti-inflammatory activity were found in the
present study to be sufficient to significantly inhibit the
constitutive isoform of the enzyme (cox-l). it is not
possible to selectively measure prostaglandin production
from cox-2 in an in vivo system as we did for cox1 through the measurement of thromboxane production.
however, given the greater potency of  xxxd2688xxx  and
l745,337 as inhibitors of cox-2, it is reasonable to
assume that this enzyme was markedly suppressed by
doses that suppressed cox-1 activity. these data therefore suggest that suppression of cox-2 does not lead
to impairment of gastric ulcer healing, at least in this
experimental model. whether or not selective inhibitors
of cox-2 will influence ulcer healing in the setting of
significant gastritis, as would occur with hdicobacter pylori infection, remains to be determined.
in summary, the present study shows the ability of an
no-releasing derivative of a commonly used nsaid to
promote the healing of experimental gastric ulcers. the
confirmation and extension of the previous report 16 that
an no donor can similarly promote ulcer healing suggest

530

elbott et al.

that the acceleration of healing by the no-releasing
nsaid is attributable to the generation of no from this
compound. further studies are required to better understand the mechanism(s) through which no modulates
ulcer healing.
