abstract
sunitinib ( xxxd3264xxx , sutent) inhibits at least eight receptor protein-tyrosine kinases including  xxxg2413xxx 
receptors 1–3 ( xxxg800xxx – xxxg802xxx ), platelet-derived growth factor receptors ( xxxg1709xxx  and  xxxg1710xxx ), stem cell factor receptor
( xxxg1279xxx ),  xxxg801xxx , and  xxxg526xxx -1 receptor ( xxxg525xxx ).  xxxg800xxx  and  xxxg1274xxx  play key roles in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis.  xxxg1710xxx , which is found in pericytes that surround capillary endothelial cells, plays a pivotal role in stabilizing the vascular endothelium. sunitinib inhibits angiogenesis by diminishing signaling through  xxxg800xxx ,  xxxg1274xxx , and  xxxg1710xxx . renal cell cancers that
have metastasized, or spread from the primary tumor, exhibit extensive vascularity, and sunitinib is approved for the treatment of these
neoplasms. activating  xxxg1279xxx  mutations occur in about 85% of gastrointestinal stromal tumors and activating  xxxg1709xxx  mutations occur in
about 5% of these tumors. sunitinib is approved for the treatment of those tumors that are resistant to imatinib (sti-571, gleevec),
another  xxxg1279xxx  and  xxxg1709xxx  protein- xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor. both sunitinib and imatinib bind reversibly to the atp binding site of their
target kinases and thereby inhibit their catalytic activity.

fms refers to viral feline mcdonough sarcoma virus),
 xxxg801xxx  (fms-like tyrosyl kinase-3),  xxxg1279xxx  (the stem cell factor
receptor), and the platelet-derived growth factor receptors
(pdfgra and pdfgrb). an extracellular segment containing ﬁve immunoglobulin-like domains, a single transmembrane segment, a juxtamembrane domain, a
cytoplasmic kinase domain that contains an insert of about
70 amino acid residues, and a carboxyterminal tail characterizes the pdgf receptor family. the vegf receptor
family includes  xxxg800xxx  ( xxxg800xxx ),  xxxg1274xxx  ( xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx ,
 xxxg1274xxx /kinase domain-containing receptor),
and  xxxg802xxx  ( xxxg802xxx ). the vegf receptors, which have
seven immunoglobulin-like extracellular domains, have
an architecture that parallels that of the pdgf receptor
family.
neovascularization, or new blood vessel formation, is
divided into two components: vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. embryonic or classical vasculogenesis is the process of new blood vessel formation from hemangioblasts

that diﬀerentiate into blood cells and mature endothelial
cells [2]. in contrast, angiogenesis is the process of new
blood vessel formation from pre-existing vascular networks
by capillary sprouting. during this process, mature endothelial cells divide and are incorporated into new capillaries. angiogenesis, which is regulated by both endogenous
activators and inhibitors, is under stringent control [3].
the vegf and pdgf family of ligands and receptors
the ligands for the vegf and pdgf receptor families,
all of which are polypeptide dimers, and their respective
receptors are listed in table 1.  xxxg1274xxx  is the predominant mediator of vegf-stimulated endothelial cell migration, proliferation, survival, and enhanced vascular
permeability that occur during vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. vegf was originally described as a  xxxg2413xxx  [2]. although, many ﬁrst messengers
including cytokines and growth factors participate in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, the vegf family is of paramount importance.
the pdgf/ xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx  family plays a supporting role in
angiogenesis [4,5]. pdgf stimulates the proliferation of
many cells of mesenchymal origin such as ﬁbroblasts and
vascular smooth muscle cells. vascular endothelial cells
produce pdgf, and the surrounding mural cells, which
include pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, express
 xxxg1710xxx .  xxxd292xxx , a pdgf-b homodimer, regulates

pericyte and ﬁbroblast functions in the supporting matrix
of tumors. thus, inhibition of both pdgf and vegf signaling promises to be more eﬀective in blocking tumor
angiogenesis than targeting either system alone [4,5].
 xxxg801xxx  mutations occur in humans with acute myelogenous leukemia (15–35% of patients), myelodysplasia (5–
10%), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (1–3%), thereby
making  xxxg801xxx  one of the most frequently mutated genes
in hematological malignancies [8]. many cancers of the
breast and female reproductive tract express  xxxg525xxx ,
which may be stimulated by  xxxg524xxx  produced by tumor
cells, the tumor-supporting matrix, or tumor-associated
macrophages.
therapeutic inhibition of vegf action
when experimental tumors reach a size of 0.2–2.0 mm in
diameter, they become hypoxic and limited in size in the
absence of angiogenesis [2]. there are more than two dozen
endogenous pro-angiogenic factors and more than two
dozen endogenous anti-angiogenic factors. in order to
increase in size, tumors undergo an angiogenic switch
where the action of pro-angiogenic factors predominates,
resulting in angiogenesis and tumor progression [3]. neoplastic growth thus requires new blood vessel formation,
and folkman proposed in a ground-breaking paper in
1971 that inhibiting angiogenesis might be an eﬀective
anti-tumor treatment [10]. strategies for restraining tumor

growth and progression include curbing vegf signaling
by using antibodies directed against vegf or by using
small molecule inhibitors directed against  xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx  kinases
[2,11].

2) [15].  xxxd3191xxx , which is given by injection, was eﬀective
in inhibiting the growth of several human tumor cell lines
(breast, colon, glioblastoma, lung, melanoma, and prostate) injected subcutaneously into athymic nude mice [21].

bevacizumab

su-6668

in a pioneering study, kim and co-workers found that
injection of a mouse monoclonal antibody (mab a.4.6.1)
directed against human vegf suppresses the growth of
several human tumor implants (xenografts) in athymic
hairless, or nude, mice in vivo [12]. these observations provided a direct demonstration that inhibition of an endogenous  xxxg786xxx  suppresses tumor
growth in vivo. mab a.4.6.1 was humanized, or engineered
into a human antibody mimetic, to form bevacizumab
(avastin). in human clinical studies that compared the eﬃcacy of standard metastatic colorectal chemotherapy (irinotecan, 5-ﬂuorouracil, and  xxxd2462xxx ) with and without
bevacizumab, median patient survival with bevacizumab
increased from 15.6 months in to 20.3 months [13] and
the u.s. food and drug administration approved bevacizumab (february 2004) as a part of the ﬁrst-line treatment along with the cytotoxic agents for metastatic
colorectal cancer.

laird and co-workers determined the kinase inhibitory
proﬁle of su-6668 (fig. 1) [22], which is a more water soluble 2-oxindole derivative than  xxxd3191xxx . using steadystate enzyme kinetics with puriﬁed recombinant  xxxg1274xxx ,
they reported that this compound is a competitive inhibitor
with respect to atp. su-6668 has a protein kinase inhibitory proﬁle similar to but more potent than that of  xxxd3191xxx  (table 2) [15]. su-6668, which is given by mouth,
inhibited the growth of the same xenografts in nude mice
noted above.

 xxxd3191xxx , an oxindole vegf receptor inhibitor
the next sections describe the development of sunitinib,
a multi-targeted protein- xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor that is
the product of a therapeutic anti-angiogenesis program at
sugen, inc. (now part of pﬁzer, inc.). using a randomscreening approach with 2-oxindoles (indolin-2-ones), sun
and colleagues found that several derivatives, including
 xxxd3191xxx  (fig. 1) inhibited  xxxg1274xxx  kinase activity [14].
manley and co-workers reported that  xxxd3191xxx  inhibited
 xxxg800xxx ,  xxxg1274xxx ,  xxxg802xxx ,  xxxg1710xxx ,  xxxg525xxx , and
 xxxg801xxx  whereas it was a less potent inhibitor of  xxxg1279xxx  (table

su-10944
patel and co-workers determined the kinase inhibitory
proﬁle of su-10944 [20], which is another 2-oxindole derivative (fig. 1). using steady-state kinetic analysis, they
found that this compound is an atp-competitive inhibitor
of  xxxg1274xxx  in vitro with an ic50 value of 96 nm and a ki
value (a dissociation constant) of 21 nm. they found that
su-10944 is a more potent inhibitor of  xxxg800xxx  when
compared with  xxxg1274xxx . however, the compound is
not an eﬀective inhibitor of  xxxg1710xxx ,  xxxg1279xxx  or fgf-r1
(table 2).
the interrelationships of an ic50, a ki for a competitive
inhibitor, a km for the corresponding substrate, and the
substrate concentration is given by the following equation:
ic50 = ki (1 + [s]/km) [23]. patel and colleagues reported a
value of 5 lm for the km of atp for  xxxg1274xxx , 21 nm for
the ki of a competitive inhibitor (su-10944) with respect to
atp, and a cellular ic50 of 227 nm for su-10944 [20]. the
solution of the above equation (227 nm = 21 nm

 xxxd3264xxx  (sunitinib)
mendel and co-workers determined the inhibitory proﬁle of sunitinib, a fourth oxindole derivative (fig. 1), by
steady-state enzyme kinetic analysis [18]. they reported
the ki values of this compound for  xxxg1274xxx  (ki = 9 nm)
or  xxxg1710xxx  (ki = 8 nm). they also measured the ic50
of sunitinib for cells expressing  xxxg1274xxx  (ic50 = 10 nm)
and  xxxg1710xxx  (ic50 = 10 nm). these values are similar
to the cellular ic50 required to inhibit vegf-stimulated
proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells
and pdgf-stimulated proliferation of nih 3t3 cells overexpressing  xxxg1710xxx . based upon the analysis in the previous paragraph, it is surprising that the ki and ic50 are
nearly identical; the ic50 is usually larger.
mendel and colleagues reported that oral administration
of sunitinib to athymic nude mice inhibited the growth of
several human tumor xenografts [18]. these investigators
reported that a single oral dose (40 mg/kg) of sunitinib
inhibited (i)  xxxg1274xxx  phosphorylation in mice in vivo
bearing the a375 melanoma or (ii)  xxxg1710xxx  phosphorylation in mice bearing the sf767t glioma. this schedule
eﬀectively blocked receptor phosphorylation for more than
12 but less than 24 h. despite the lack of continuous inhibition of receptor phosphorylation, this regimen eﬀectively
decreased mean vascular density (a measure of anti-angiogenesis) and restrained tumor growth. they reported that
plasma levels of 125–250 nm sunitinib were suﬃcient to
inhibit the phosphorylation of these two cellular receptors.
they also reported that 95% of the drug was bound to
albumin; the concentration of free drug (6–12 nm) corre-

lates with the biochemical ki and cellular ic50 values.
the authors concluded that maintaining plasma sunitinib
concentrations above 125 nm (50 ng/ml) for 12 h on a
once daily oral regimen represented an initial therapeutic
goal in human clinical trials.

sunitinib disease targets
primary and metastatic renal cell cancers are vascular
neoplasms that are resistant to traditional cytotoxic
chemotherapy and radiation therapy [24]. motzer and coworkers studied the response of patients with renal cell cancer that had metastasized to other organs and that failed to
respond to interleukin-2 treatment [24]. these patients were
treated in 6-week cycles with sunitinib (50 mg/day by
mouth) for 4 weeks and no drug for 2 weeks. during the
treatment phase, they found that the minimum, or trough,
plasma concentrations of sunitinib and  xxxd3264xxx , its active
metabolite (fig. 1), were 215 nm (84 ng/ml), which is
above the minimum concentration (125 nm) that was eﬀective in pre-clinical animal studies [18]. this on–oﬀ treatment cycle was designed to attenuate the side eﬀect of
fatigue experienced by a substantial fraction of subjects.
the median time to progression of disease in this study
was 8.7 months compared with a median time of 2.5
months for placebo (a historical comparison and not part
of this study).
during the 2-week drug-free period, it is likely that angiogenesis in humans resumes. mancuso et al. have shown
that considerable revascularization occurs in mice within
1 week after cessation of  xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx  inhibition [25]. however,
the regrown vasculature regressed as much during a second
course of treatment as it did during the ﬁrst. in an attempt
to circumvent the drug-free periods, human clinical trials

r. roskoski jr. / biochemical and biophysical research communications 356 (2007) 323–328

using continuous treatment with 37.5 mg/day of sunitinib
are underway [26].
results on the treatment of people who had gastrointestinal stromal tumors with disease progression despite imatinib treatment or who were intolerant of imatinib showed
that the median time for progression-free survival in the
sunitinib group was 6.3 months versus 1.5 months for the
placebo group [27]. as a result of the u.s. food and drug
administration approval of sunitinib for the treatment of
metastatic renal cell cancer and gastrointestinal stromal
tumors (january 2006), more people will be treated with
the drug and considerably more information on its eﬀectiveness in these and other neoplasms will be forthcoming.
that experimental solid tumors require angiogenesis to
grow to a size with a diameter exceeding 0.2–2.0 mm [2]
strongly supports the rationale for treating solid tumors
with angiogenesis inhibitors. sunitinib is in clinical trials
for the treatment of breast, colorectal, gastric, non-smallcell lung, and prostate cancer (see [http://www.cancer.
gov/clinicaltrials/developments/anti-angio-table] for a
complete listing of anti-angiogenic clinical trials).
oral bioavailability of sunitinib
sunitinib satisﬁes lipinski’s four ‘‘rules of ﬁve’’ as criteria for oral bioavailability [28]. the four properties are
common characteristics found in most orally eﬀective drugs
that are in use today. the rules derive their name because
the relevant limitations are multiples of 5. the ﬁrst criterion is that a compound should have no more that ﬁve
hydrogen bond donors (oh and nh groups); sunitinib
has three. the second criterion is that the drug should have
no more than 10 hydrogen bond acceptors (notably n and
o); the compound has 2. the third criterion is that the
molecular weight should be less than 500 while that of sunitinib (c22h27n4fo2) is 390. the fourth rule is that the log
of the partition coeﬃcient (log p), or the log of the ratio of
the solubility of the drug in octanol/water, should be less
than 5; that for sunitinib is 5.2.
the log of the partition coeﬃcient, which is a measure of
the lipophilicity of a compound, is an important parameter
for oral absorption because it inﬂuences the ability of a
compound to pass through cell membranes including those
of the intestine [28]. compounds that are too hydrophilic
(negative log p) are unable to pass through membranes.
compounds that are too lipophilic (log p greater than 5)
are too insoluble in physiological solutions to be transported to the target cells.
epilogue
imatinib and sunitinib target selective protein kinases.
for example, imatinib inhibits abl (a non-receptor protein- xxxg2198xxx ), arg (abl-related gene),  xxxg1279xxx  (the stem
cell factor receptor), and  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx  (a and b) [6]. sunitinib,
which is a potent inhibitor of eight protein-tyrosine kinases
(table 2), is also a multi-targeted drug. a perceived advan-

327

tage of targeting protein kinases over traditional cytotoxic
therapy is greater speciﬁcity toward the tumor cells with
fewer side eﬀects. this strategy is the incarnation of the
‘‘magic bullet’’ concept promulgated by paul ehrlich
[http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1908/ehrlich-bio.
html].
folkman hypothesized in 1971 that inhibiting angiogenesis might be an eﬀective anti-cancer therapy [10]. it was not
until 1990 that the work of several groups converged to
characterize the nature of vegf/ xxxg2413xxx  [2]. a mouse monoclonal antibody against vegf was developed in 1993 [12],
and the u.s. food and drug administration approved a
humanized version of the antibody, bevacizumab, for the
treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer along with standard cytotoxic therapy in 2004 [13]. the ﬁrst report of a
2-oxyindole targeting the vegf receptors appeared in
1998 [14] and sunitinib monotherapy was approved for
the treatment of metastatic renal cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumors in 2006, a remarkably short time.
although slow in developing, this area of research has
attracted considerable attention as evidenced by the publication of about 95 papers per week in 2006 on angiogenesis
compared with a total of about 200 papers in all of 1990.
carmeliet [29] emphasized the signiﬁcance of this work by
stating ‘‘angiogenesis research will probably change the
face of medicine within the next decades, with more than
500 million people worldwide predicted to beneﬁt from
pro- or anti-angiogenesis treatments.’’ pro-angiogenesis
therapies, which are less well developed than anti-angiogenesis therapies, may be useful in the prevention and treatment of disorders characterized by inadequate blood ﬂow
such as atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.
