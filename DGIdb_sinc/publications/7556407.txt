abstract

 xxxd3491xxx , a long-acting somatostatin analog, possesses an analgesic effect. the purpose of this work was to determine a
tachykinergic involvement.  xxxd3491xxx  reduced  xxxg2240xxx -induced biting and scratching in mice. this inhibitory effect of
 xxxg2240xxx  action was confirmed by experiments performed on the bronchial apparatus of guinea-pigs known to possess
tachykinin nk 1 and nk 2 receptors. (i)  xxxd3491xxx  reduced the  xxxg2240xxx -induced plasmatic exudation. (ii) it inhibited
selectively the tachykinin-dependent second contractile phase induced by electrical field stimulation of isolated bronchi. (iii) it
shifted to the right the concentration-effect curve of  xxxg2240xxx -induced contraction of isolated main bronchi. the peptide
displaced [3h] xxxg2240xxx  (ics0 = 3.3 _+ 1.8 × 10 7 m) from guinea-pig bronchial tachykinin nk 1 sites. the displacement of
[125i] xxxg2240xxx , a specific tachykinin nk 2 receptor ligand, needed higher concentrations (ics0 = 4.5 +_0.6 × 10 -6 m). it is
concluded that  xxxd3491xxx  possesses an antagonist activity on guinea-pig tachykinin nk 1 receptors; the involvement in its
analgesic action is discussed.

i. introduction

an analgesic effect of somatostatin has been
demonstrated in animals (rezek et al., 1978) and also
in humans after intravenous (sicuteri et al., 1984),
intrathecal (chrubasik et al., 1984) or epidural
(chrubasik et al., 1985; meynadier et al., 1985; gennari et al., 1987) injection. however, the rapid degradation of somatostatin (plasma elimination half-life: 3
min (kutz et al., 1986)) limits its therapeutic utility.
octreotide, its best known analog (bauer et al., 1992),
elicits the same response after subcutaneous (williams
et al., 1987; wolfe and cathey, 1990), intramuscular
(pincus et al., 1989), intravenous (lamberts et al., 1985;
williams et al., 1986), intrathecal (penn et al., 1990,
1992) or topical (ellis, 1990) administration.

 xxxd3491xxx  ( xxxd3491xxx ) ( xxxd1793xxx -cys-tyr- xxxd1794xxx -lysvai-cys- xxxd915xxx ), an analog of somatostatin synthesized by cai et al. (1986), was shown to produce a very
long-lasting central opioid-mediated antinociceptive effect in rodents (eschalier et al., 1991; b6toin et al.,
1994a,b) after subcutaneous injection. preliminary clinical case reports have confirmed this activity (auma~tre
et al., 1991). b6toin et al. (1994a) showed that the
naloxone-reversible antinociceptive effect of  xxxd3491xxx 
indirectly involved an opioidergic mechanism suggesting that other mechanisms might be involved.
the aim of this work was to examine the mechanism
of this action, particularly for a tachykinergic involvement. first, we tested the effect of  xxxd3491xxx  on the
intrathecal  xxxg2240xxx -induced behavioral manifestations in mice (hylden and wilcox, 1981). behaviours
elicited by intrathecally administered  xxxg2240xxx  are
inhibited by agents with spinal antinociceptive activity,
such as opiates and noradrenergic agents (hylden and

242

f. b&oinet al. /european journal of pharmacology279 (1995) 241-249

wilcox, 1983). secondly, studies were performed on
the bronchial smooth muscle, which is known to possess numerous tachykinin receptors (nki,  xxxg2240xxx ) (frossard and advenier, 1991). and finally, the binding of
 xxxd3491xxx  to tachykinin nk 1 receptors of rat brain
and guinea-pig bronchi and to tachykinin nk 2 receptors of rat duodenum was determined.

2. materials and methods

2.1. behavioral studies
animals
male swiss webster mice (17-25 g) (biolab, white
bear lake, mn, usa) were used. there were ten mice
per cage, who had free access to food and water and
were acclimatized to the laboratory for at least 24 h
before the experiments. each series of experiments was
carried out between 10:00 a.m. and 12:00 noon.
injection procedure and protocol
intrathecal injections of  xxxg2240xxx  or  xxxd3491xxx 
were carried out in unanaesthetized mice at l-5, l-6
intervertebral space using 30-gauge 0.5-inch disposable
needles with plastic luer hubs (b-d yale) mated to a
50- xxxd1919xxx  hamilton syringe according to the method of
hylden and wilcox (1980). each needle was used for
not more than six injections. all agents injected were
diluted in physiological saline-acetic acid vehicle (hall
and stewart, 1983) for intrathecal injection of 5- xxxd1919xxx 
volumes over a 20-30 s period.
each animal received a first intrathecal injection of
 xxxd3491xxx  (8 n m o l / m o u s e ) or vehicle, then 5 min
later, a second intrathecal injection of  xxxg2240xxx  (10
n g / m o u s e ) or vehicle. each animal was treated with
one of the following four regimens: vehicle + vehicle,
 xxxd3491xxx  + vehicle, vehicle +  xxxg2240xxx ,  xxxd3491xxx 
+  xxxg2240xxx . n = 8 in each group.
behavioral measures
after  xxxg2240xxx  injection, mice were placed in a
two-litre glass beaker and observed continuously for 1
min. the number of caudally directed licks and
scratches together with the number of episodes of
reciprocal hind limb scratching were counted by the
same observer to maintain consistency.
2. 2. airway studies
measurement of airway microvascular leakage
vascular permeability was quantified by the extravasation of evans blue dye (evans et al., 1988; rogers et
al., 1989; udaka et al., 1970). tricoloured guinea-pigs
weighing 250-350 g were anaesthetized with urethane

(1.25 g / k g intraperitoneally). a jugular vein was cannulated for drug injections. at time 0,  xxxd3357xxx  (0.1
m g / k g i.v.) was injected, followed, 30 rain later, by
evans blue dye (30 m g / k g i.v.).  xxxd3491xxx  (8-800
n m o l / k g i.v.) or saline (1 m l / k g ) was injected 20 min
before evans blue dye. one minute after evans blue,
saline (1 ml/kg),  xxxg2240xxx  (3 /.~g/kg i.v.) or histamine (30  xxxd3277xxx /kg i.v.) were injected; 5 min later the
thorax was opened and a blunt-ended, 13-gauge needle
passed through a left ventriculotomy into the aorta.
the ventricles were cross-clamped and blood was expelled through an incision in the right atrium at 80 mm
hg pressure with about 100 ml saline, in order to
remove the intravascular dye from the circulation until
the perfusate was clear. the lungs were then removed.
the connective tissues, vasculature, and parenchyma
were gently straped, and the airways were divided into
four components: lower part of trachea, main bronchi
and proximal (the proximal 3 mm portion) and distal
intrapulmonary airways (rogers et al., 1989; udaka et
al., 1970). the tissues were blotted dry, placed in
preweighed tubes and reweighed, and their dye content
was extracted in formamide at 37°c for 18-24 h. dye
concentration was quantified from light absorbance at
620 nm (dcp spectrophotometer, vial, dieren,
netherlands) and its tissue content (ng d y e / m g wet
weight tissue) was calculated from a standard curve of
dye concentrations in the 0 . 5 - 1 0 / x g / m l range.
all animals (n = 6) were pretreated with  xxxd3357xxx 
to block  xxxg2240xxx  metabolism (ichinose and barnes,
1990) and potentiate its effect. time to remove tissues
was chosen in agreement with rogers et al. (1990) and
qian et al. (1993) who have shown that  xxxg2240xxx 
and  xxxg2240xxx -induced leakage was maximal in all
airways after 5 min and that these effects were specifically inhibited by cp-96,345, a tachykinin nk t receptor antagonist and sr 48968, a tachykinin nk 2 receptor antagonist, respectively.
electrical field stimulation
preparation of bronchial smooth muscle. main bronchi
rings were obtained from tricoloured guinea-pigs of
either sex (250-350 g) anaesthetized with urethane
(1.25 g / k g i.p.). the rings were equilibrated under an
initial tension of 2.0 g in krebs solution at 37 ° c gassed
with 95% 02-5% co 2. after 1 h of equilibration,
resting tension was between 1.5 and 2 g. under these
conditions, responses to agonists were reproducible
over several hours. tension was measured isometrically
with pioden strain gauges (uf-1) and amplifiers (dei
lierre electronique, france) and displayed on
recorders (linseis l6512, france). the composition of
the krebs solution was (mm): naci 118.0; kcl 5.4;
cac12 2.5; ki-i2po 4 1.2; mgso 4 1.2; nahco 3 25.0
and glucose 11.7.

transmural stimulation. each organ bath was fitted
with two platinum plate electrodes (1 cm 2) placed
alongside the tissue (10 mm apart) for transmural
electrical field stimulation (biphasic pulse with 1 ms,
constant current of 320 ma for 10 s) (szolcsanyi and
bartho, 1982; undem et al., 1990; martin et al., 1992).
these stimulus parameters caused an optimal reproducible biphasic contraction which consisted of a fast
contraction followed by a sustained contractile response, both abolished by tetrodotoxin. the first, fast,
component is inhibited by atropine and results from
stimulation of cholinergic nerves. the late and prolonged second phase is nonadrenergic noncholinergic
(nanc) in nature, and is abolished or strongly reduced by antagonists of tachykinin nk 2 receptors,
such as sr 48968 and men 10,207, and partially
reduced by cp-96,345 (lundberg et al., 1983; maggi et
al., 1991; martin et al., 1992).

acetylcholine (3 x 10-3 m), n = 6. we have previously
shown that, under similar conditions,  xxxg2240xxx 
concentration-response curves were shifted to the right
by sr 48968 whereas concentration-response curves of
 xxxg2240xxx  were shifted to the right by cp-96,345
(martin et al., 1992).

drugs
the drugs used were: acetylcholine (pharmacie centrale des h6pitaux, paris, france);  xxxd3491xxx  (debiopharm, lausanne, switzerland); indomethacin (merck);
propranolol,  xxxd3357xxx , histamine,  xxxg2240xxx  (sigma,
st. louis, mo, usa); [nlea°] xxxg2240xxx -(4-10)
(cambridge research biochemicals, uk). all drugs
were dissolved in distilled water and then diluted in
krebs solution, except for indomethacin which was
dissolved in ethanol and then diluted in krebs solution.
the maximal amount of ethanol used (0.4%) did not
alter the response to acetylcholine.

protocol. after a 1 h resting period, bronchial rings
were contracted to maximal tension with acetylcholine
(3 × 10 -3 m) and then allowed to equilibrate for 60
min while they were washed with krebs solution every
15 min. the resting tension was adjusted to 1.5-2.0 g.
in all experiments, propranolol (10 -6 m) was added to
the buffer solution at the start of the experiment to
avoid the influence of adrenergic nerve stimulation,
and indomethacin (10 -6 m) to avoid indirect effects of
prostaglandins on the neuronal responses (linden et
al., 1991; maggi et al., 1991; undem et al., 1990).
after tension had returned to the baseline tone, the
preparation was stimulated every 10-15 min increasing
the frequency (0.5, 1, 4, 8, 16 and 32 hz), for 1 ms, and
320 ma for 10 s using a stimulator (dei lierre electronique, france) where the voltage output was adjusted to give a constant current of 320 ma and a
biphasic rectangular pulse of alternating polarity. these
procedures were repeated in the absence or presence
of  xxxd3491xxx  (10 -7 to 10-4 m) which was administered 30 min before transmural stimulation. the results were expressed as percentages of the maximal
contraction induced by acetylcholine (3 × 10 -3 m), n
=5.

effect of  xxxd3491xxx  on cumulative concentration-response curves for acetylcholine, [nlel°] xxxg2240xxx (4-10) and  xxxg2240xxx 
a similar preparation of isolated bronchi was used.
after obtaining a stable baseline tone cumulative doses
of acetylcholine, [nlel°] xxxg2240xxx -(4-10) or  xxxg2240xxx  was added without any pretreatment or 30
min after  xxxd3491xxx  administration (10 -7 to 10 -5 m).
concentration-response curves were obtained by addition of these compounds every 5-10 min until a plateau
response was attained. the results were expressed as
percentages of the maximal concentration induced by

statistical analysis of results
data are expressed as means + s.e.m. results were
analysed by a student's t-test. the significance level
was p < 0.05.

2.3. binding studies
tritiated  xxxg2240xxx  (40-49 ci/mmol) and iodinated  xxxg2240xxx  (around 2000 ci/mmol) were purchased from amersham (france). all peptides were
obtained from bachem (switzerland) except  xxxd3491xxx ,
which was ordered from debiopharm. stock solutions
of peptides were stored at - 80° c in aliquots sufficient
for a single experiment. tachykinin nk 1 receptor binding studies were performed in rat brain and guinea-pig
homogenates as previously reported (fardin and garret, 1991; floch et al., 1994, respectively). tachykinin
nk 2 receptor binding assays were done with rat duodenum homogenates as described by garret et al.
(1991) except that [125i] xxxg2240xxx  was used as the
ligand instead of tritiated  xxxg2240xxx .

preparation of tissues
for the tachykinin nk 1 receptor binding assays,
whole brain (minus cerebral cortices and cerebellum)
from male sprague-dawley rats (250-300 g, charles
river, france) and bronchi from male albino dunklinhartley guinea-pigs (300-400 g, charles river, france)
were removed rapidly after decapitation of the animals
and homogenized, using an ultra-turrax, in 15 volumes of ice-cold 50 mm tricine buffer (ph 7.4 at 20° c)
containing glucose (1 g/l) and mgc12 (10 mm) (buffer
1). the homogenates were then centrifuged twice at
50 000 × g for 10 min with intermediate rehomogenization of the pellets in fresh buffer after the first centrifugation. the final pellets were resuspended in 5 vol-

for the tachykinin nk 2 receptor binding assays,
duodenums were rapidly removed after decapitation of
the rats which were used after an overnight fast. tissues were rinsed and the mucosa scratched off. the
homogenates were then treated in the same way as for
the tachykinin nk 1 receptor binding assays, except
that a tris-hcl buffer (50 mm, ph 7.4 at 2 0 ° 0
containing 0.05% bacitracin was used.

binding assays
the peptides were freshly diluted from the stock
solutions into ice-cold buffer containing bovine serum
albumin 0.06%. they were tested for their ability to
displace the binding of 0.3 nm [3h] xxxg2240xxx  (final
concentration) according to the procedure of lee et al.
(1986) (slightly modified) or the binding of 0.1 nm
[125i] xxxg2240xxx . for the tachykinin nk 1 receptor
binding assays, the binding interaction was initiated by
the addition of homogenates (1 ml) to 0.1 ml of the
solution containing the ligand and 0.1 ml of binding
buffer either alone (determination of total binding) or
containing the competing drug (eight concentrations),
in a final volume of 1.2 ml (final concentration of
protein: 0.3 mg per ml) in buffer 1 containing bovine
 xxxg124xxx  (0.02%), bacitracin (40 mg/1), leu-

peptin (4 mg/1) and  xxxd3463xxx  (5 mg/l).  xxxd2418xxx  (1
/zm) was added to the buffer for assays in guinea-pig
bronchi. non-specific binding was defined in the presence of 1 p~m  xxxg2240xxx . for the tachykinin nk 2
receptor binding assays, aliquots (0.5 ml) of rat duodenum homogenates (final concentration of protein:
0.2 mg per ml) were added to 0.05 ml of the binding
buffer either alone (for total binding) or containing the
competing drug (eight concentrations) (final volume 0.6
ml). in these assays, the binding buffer was a tris-hc1
buffer (50 mm, ph 7.4 at 20 ° c) supplemented with
bovine  xxxg124xxx  (0.02%), mnc12 (3 ram), bacitracin (40 mg/1), leupeptin (4 mg/1) and hymostatin (4
mg/1). non-specific binding was defined in the presence of 1 /xm  xxxg2240xxx . incubations were performed at 25° c for 20 min ([3h] xxxg2240xxx ) or 60 min
([125i] xxxg2240xxx ). the binding interaction was terminated by rapid filtration (skatron cell harvester) over
whatman g f / b glass fibre filters presoaked with 0.3%
polyethyleneimine. filters were immediately rinsed with
ice-cold buffer and the radioactivity trapped on the
filters was measured by liquid scintillometry in 5 ml of
ready-solv scintillant (beckman). individual displacement curves were analysed with the iterative curve-fitting program ebda, using a non-linear regression
procedure. results are the means _+ s.e.m. of at least
3 independent determinations, each one performed in
duplicate.

used (except for the 8 n m o l / k g for trachea) (fig. 2).
only one dose (80 n m o l / k g ) induced a significant
effect in proximal bronchi; no significant effect was
observed in distal bronchi. the same doses of
 xxxd3491xxx  induced a weak decrease in vascular permeability of animals u n t r e a t e d by  xxxg2240xxx  (results not
shown). finally, histamine-induced increase in evans
blue extravasation was not modified by  xxxd3491xxx  (results not shown).

3.1. behavioral studies
animals treated only with saline did not develop any
behavioral manifestations of biting and scratching while
animals co-treated with  xxxd3491xxx  + saline or  xxxg2240xxx  + saline presented such behaviours (1.3 + 0.2
and 27.6 +_ 4.0 behaviours, respectively). intrathecally

effects of  xxxd3491xxx  on the concentration-response
curves for acetylcholine, [nlel°] xxxg2240xxx -(4-10) and

 xxxd3491xxx  concentration-dependently shifted the
curves obtained with  xxxg2240xxx  slightly but significantly  xxxd1891xxx  -5 m to the right (fig. 4). for low concentrations of  xxxg2240xxx  (e.g. 10 -8 m, which gave 20%
of contraction, i.e. the same level of contraction as that
induced by electrical field stimulation), the decrease in
the effect was approx. 50%. the concentration-response curves for [nlel°] xxxg2240xxx -(4-10) and
acetylcholine were not modified (results not shown).

needed to inhibit [125i] xxxg2240xxx  binding to rat
duodenum were higher: ics0 = 4.5 + 0.6 × 10 - 6 m.

all the results obtained in in vivo studies lead to the
same conclusion:  xxxd3491xxx  reduces the effects of  xxxg2240xxx . first, this reduction was demonstrated by its
inhibition of the motor behaviour of  xxxg2240xxx  induced at the spinal level. the decrease in the score of
this reaction, considered as the result of an excitation
of spinal nociceptive neurons (hylden and wilcox,
1981) would suggest an antinociceptive potential of the
peptide. however, this conclusion must be modulated

by two data: huang (1992) thinks that this behavioral
motor component was not a nocieeptive reaction and
secondly  xxxd3491xxx  itself weakly induced biting and
scratching when it was intrathecally injected. this last
result is in line with the effect of somatostatin known
to induce the same behaviour (lembeck et al., 1981;
seybold et al., 1982; fasmer and post, 1983). finally,
whatever may be the true significance of biting and
scratching behaviour, these results show that  xxxd3491xxx 
is able to inhibit the effect of  xxxg2240xxx .
this ability to reduce the effect of  xxxg2240xxx  was
confirmed by the results obtained in guinea-pigs:
 xxxd3491xxx  reduced the  xxxg2240xxx -induced extravasation of evans blue dye in trachea and main bronchi. it
is important to note that the action of  xxxd3491xxx  was
dose-dependent and plateaued for doses from 80
n m o l / k g to 0.8 /+mol/kg, a phenomenon which is in
line with results obtained in pain tests (b6toin et al.,
1994a). comparison of these results with others, obtained with agonists or antagonists of tachykinin nk~
receptors, might suggest a tachykinin nk~-dependent
mechanism for  xxxd3491xxx .  xxxg2240xxx  (an agonist of
tachykinin nk 1 receptors) has been demonstrated to
be more potent than other tachykinins (agonists of
tachykinin nk 2 receptors) in increasing bronchus vascular permeability ( xxxg2240xxx  >  xxxg2240xxx  =
 xxxg2241xxx ) (rogers et al., 1988). tachykinin nk 1
receptor antagonists inhibit the neurogenic plasmatic
exudation in the airways (delay-goyet and lundberg,
1991; qian et al., 1993 and garret et al., 1991 for
cp-96,345 and rp-67580, respectively). like capsaicin
(which induces neuronal depletion of  xxxg2240xxx ),
cp-96,345 inhibits the increase of vascular permeability
due to bradykinin (qian et al., 1993).
this hypothesis that  xxxd3491xxx  acts on the
tachykinin nk 1 receptor was confirmed by all the
other results obtained after in vitro studies.  xxxd3491xxx 
inhibited selectively the second contractile phase induced by electrical field stimulation of isolated bronchi.
this second phase has been shown to be due to
tachykinin release with a mixed involvement of  xxxg2240xxx  and  xxxg2240xxx  while the first phase involves a cholinergic component (barnes, 1992; martin
et al., 1992). this effect of  xxxd3491xxx  was qualitatively
similar to that obtained with a lower concentration of
the tachykinin nki receptor antagonist, cp-96,345
(martin et al., 1992). this observed similarity would
suggest a tachykinin nk~ antagonist activity for
 xxxd3491xxx , though its effect could also have been
obtained by blocking tachykinin nk 2 receptors. the
possibility of an interaction with tachykinin nk 2 receptors was excluded by the inability of  xxxd3491xxx  to
induce any change in the [nlel°] xxxg2240xxx -(4-10)induced contraction of guinea-pig isolated bronchi, a
result in line with the demonstrated low ability of
 xxxd3491xxx  to displace a tachykinin nk 2 receptor lig-

f. b~ xxxd2924xxx  et al. /european journal of pharmacology 279 (1995) 241-249

and. in contrast, both binding and in vitro studies
performed with guinea-pig bronchi demonstrated an
interaction of  xxxd3491xxx  with tachykinin nk 1 receptors.  xxxd3491xxx  displaced [3h] xxxg2240xxx  with an
ics0 of 3.3 _+ 1.8 x 10 -7 m (on guinea-pig bronchi),
higher than that obtained with cp-96,345 (3.4 + 0.8
nm, snider et al., 1991). the peptide exerts an antagonist effect on these receptors as demonstrated by the
concentration-dependent inhibition of  xxxg2240xxx -induced contraction of isolated main bronchi. interestingly, the first concentration which induced a significant inhibition (10 -5 m) was the same as the first
active concentration during the second contractile
phase induced by the electrical field stimulation of
isolated bronchi. moreover, this value, like the doses
effective in in vivo studies (corresponding to concentrations from 8 x 10 6 to 8 x 10 4 m of the injected
solutions), was compatible with the obtained ics0 value.
thus, it can be concluded that the effects observed in
guinea-pigs are due to an antagonist activity of
 xxxd3491xxx  on tachykinin nk~ receptors.
taking into account that tachykinin nk~ receptors
are involved in nociceptive transmission at the dorsal
horn of the spinal cord (sandberg and iversen, 1982;
besson and chaouch, 1987) and that  xxxd3491xxx  was
shown both to cross the blood-brain barrier (banks et
al., 1990) and to possess a central antinociceptive effect
(b6toin et al., 1994a), it can be postulated that this last
property of the peptide might, at least in part, be due
to its antagonist activity on tachykinin nk 1 receptors.
this mechanism might explain the inhibition by
 xxxd3491xxx  of the  xxxg2240xxx -induced motor behavior
at the spinal level in mice. however, high concentrations of  xxxd3491xxx  were needed to inhibit [3h] xxxg2240xxx  binding to rat brain membranes (ics0 = 2.1 _+
1.5 x 10 -6 m) suggesting a low affinity which does not
seem to be able to account for an antinociceptive
action based on a direct antagonist effect of the peptide on tachykinin nk 1 receptors in healthy rats or
mice (the tachykinin nk~ receptors are similar in the
two species (beresford et al., 1991; fardin et al., 1992)).
however, in humans, who possess the same tachykinin
nk t receptors as guinea-pigs (beresford et al., 1991;
fardin et al., 1992, 1993; gorbulev et al., 1992), a
better affinity of  xxxd3491xxx  for these receptors can be
expected and the antagonist effect of the peptide might
participate in its analgesic activity (auma]tre et al.,
1991).
it is interesting to note that the antinociceptive
effect of  xxxd3491xxx  was suppressed by naloxone (b6toin
et al., 1994a,b) which suggests that this peptide could
stimulate inhibiting controls of pain and inhibit, directly or indirectly,  xxxg2240xxx -dependent pronociceptive mechanisms. such a profile suggests a possible
therapeutic interest in various pain syndromes. its prolonged duration of action (eschalier et al., 1991; b6toin

247

et al., 1994a,b) and the suspected increased involvement of central  xxxg2240xxx -mediated transmission of
nociception in hyperalgesic diabetic animals (courteix
et al., 1993) would suggest a particular potential in the
treatment of chronic neuropathic pain. furthermore,
the results obtained here on airways might be of interest taking into account that some inflammatory processes with plasmatic exudation are involved in airway
pathologies (chung et al., 1990; pearson, 1991).
