 xxxd3550xxx  and aerosolised  xxxd2331xxx  in a model of acute respiratory failure.  in this study, the impact of aerosolised prostacyclin (pgi2) and  xxxd2331xxx  in the absence or presence of subthreshold intravascular doses of the dual-selective phosphodiesterase-3/4 inhibitor  xxxd3550xxx  was investigated in an experimental model of acute respiratory failure. in perfused rabbit lungs, continuous infusion of the thromboxane-a2-mimetic u46619 provoked pulmonary hypertension, accompanied by progressive lung oedema formation and severe ventilation-perfusion mismatch with predominance of shunt flow (increasing from approximately 2 to 58%, as assessed by the multiple inert gas elimination technique). aerosolisation of pgi2 (in total 1.05 microg x kg(-1) for 15 min caused a decrease in pulmonary artery pressure (ppa) and a limitation of maximum shunt flow to approximately 37%. when nebulised pgi2 was combined with subthreshold intravascular  xxxd3550xxx , which did not affect pulmonary haemodynamics per se, the duration of the pgi2 effect was increased. aerosolisation of 3 microg x kg(-1) pgi2 resulted in a transient decrease in ppa and a reduction in shunt flow. in the presence of subthreshold  xxxd3550xxx , the effects of this pgi2 dose were only marginally increased. aerosolisation of  xxxd2331xxx  (in total 0.7 microg x kg(-1)) for 15 min caused a more sustained decrease in ppa, some enhanced reduction of oedema formation as compared with pgi2 and a decrease in shunt flow to approximately 32%. most impressively, when combined with subthreshold  xxxd3550xxx ,  xxxd2331xxx  suppressed oedema formation to <15% and shunt flow to approximately 8%. in conclusion, combined use of aerosolised  xxxd2331xxx  and subthreshold systemic phosphodiesterase-3/4 inhibitor may result in selective intrapulmonary vasodilation, a reduction in oedema formation and an improvement in ventilation-perfusion matching in acute respiratory failure.
