key words.  xxxd3017xxx  - vagus nerve - neuroeffector transmission - acetylcholine

abstract. it has been reported that low concentrations of noradrenaline or  xxxd2398xxx  reduce the resting
tension of the smooth muscle cells and suppress acetylcholine release from the vagal nerve terminals through
activation of bs-adrenoceptors.  xxxd3017xxx , bj-adrenoceptor stimulant, has a high potency and selectivity for
airway smooth muscle tissues. however, there is little documentation on the prejunctional actions of this chem-
ical in airway smooth muscle, especially in man. in the present study, the effects of  xxxd3017xxx  on excitatory
neuroeffector transmission in the human bronchus were investigated.  xxxd3017xxx  (10-" to 10-7 m) dose depend-
ently reduced the amplitude of the contractions evoked by electrical field stimulation in the presence of indo-
 xxxd2817xxx  (10° m), fpl-55712 (10° m), and  xxxd2243xxx  (10° m ). by contrast,  xxxd3017xxx  (107 to 10-°° m) had
no effect on the postjunctional response of smooth muscle cells to exogeneously applied acetylcholine. pre-
treatment with ici-118551 (10-7 m), a b.-adrenoceptor-blocking agent, reduced the inhibitory action of procate-
rol on the amplitude of twitch contractions evoked by field stimulations in the human bronchus. these results
indicate that  xxxd3017xxx  at low concentrations has a prejunctional action, inhibiting the excitatory neuroeffec-
tor transmission and presumably suppressing transmitter release from the vagal nerve terminals through
b,-adrenoceptors in the human bronchial tissue. the prejunctional action of  xxxd3017xxx  explains partly its
potent bronchodilator effects in clinical use.

 

introduction however, the prejunctional actions of  xxxd3017xxx  have
not been investigated in human airway smooth mus-
cle. in the present study, we investigated whether pro-
caterol inhibits excitatory neuroeffector transmission
of the vagal nerve in human bronchial tissues at a

dose less than in clinical use.

it is generally considered that the vagal nerve plays
an important role in the pathogenesis of bronchial
asthma [1]. recently, it was demonstrated that ace-
tylcholine (ach) release from the vagal nerve termi-
 xxxd3215xxx  is regulated in many ways; e.g., endogeneous
ach,  xxxd1903xxx , or catecholamine inhibit the
transmitter release by activating m,-muscarinic, pros-
taglandin e, and f-adrenergic receptors [2-4]. more
recently, it was also reported that >-stimulants, such

 

methods

twelve human bronchial strips were prepared from 9 patients
with lung cancer (4 men and 5 women, mean age 62 years). at the

as  xxxd3017xxx , inhibit the release of ach from the
vagal nerve terminals at a concentration less than that
needed to relax airway smooth muscle [5, 6]. procate-
rol, 5-(1-hydroxy-2-isopropylaminobutyl)-8-hydroxy-
carbostyril hydrochloride, has a high potency and se-
lectivity for airway smooth muscle tissue [7-12] and is
widely used in the treatment of asthmatic subjects.

     

time of thoracic surgery, macroscopically normal lung tissue was
obtained and immediately placed in well-oxygenated krebs solu-
tion. after rapid transportation to the laboratory, bronchi (inter-
nal diameter 3-5 mm) were dissected free of lung parenchyma and
stored overnight in a large volume of cooled (4°c) and aerated
krebs solution. this procedure should thoroughly wash out nar-
cotics and any substances liberated during the dissection. the ph
value of the solution after overnight storage ranged from 7.2 to

resent the pulses of field stimulation at 20 v, 20 hz, and 800 us,
and dots represent 30 pulses. each field stimulation was applied
every 3 min. application of  xxxd3017xxx  reduced the amplitude of
the twitch contractions.

7.3. the bronchi were then cut open, and muscle strips were care-
fully freed from cartilage and epithelium under a binocular micro-
scope. the muscle strips used for tension recording (width 1-15,
length 2-3 mm) were composed of several muscle bundles.

these preparations were bathed in a modified krebs solution
with the following ionic concentration (mm): na* 137.4, k* 5.9,
mg?* 1.2, ca** 2.5, cl 134.0, h;po; 1.2, hco; 15.5, and glucose
115. the solution was aerated with 95% o,, and the ph was
adjusted to 7.3-7.4,

to measure the mechanical changes, the tissue was mounted in
a i-ml organ bath through which the test solution, at a temper-
ature of 35°c, flowed continuously, and the solution were
changed using a multiway tap. the preparation was placed verti-
cally, and the ends were tied with silk thread. one end of the strip
was tied to an isometric transducer (nihon kohden, tb-612t) and
the other end to a hood at the bottom of the bath. the strips were
set up with an initial tension of 0.1-0.2 g, which was reported to be
optimal in a previous study [13], equilibrated 1-3h with krebs
solution, and the mechanical activity was recorded using a pen
recorder (nihon kohden, wt-687g).

to produce neurogenic responses, electrical field stimulation
(efs) was applied through a pair of electrodes, consisting of silver
plates separated by 7mm, and placed so that a current pulse
would pass transversely across the tissue. repetitive stimulation at
20 hz was applied with an electronic stimulator (nihon kohden,
sen-7203), using a current pulse of 800 us in duration and 20 v in
intensity. to observe the ach sensitivity of smooth muscle, we
measured contractions induced by 5x10 m of ach which
induced almost the same contractions as those induced by efs.

human bronchial smooth muscle had a spontaneous fluctu-
ation in basal tone, and a steady resting tension was not obtained.

reduced the muscle tone, and a steady level was obtained [13].
therefore, the experiments were performed in the presence of
fpl-55712 (10° m) and indomethacin (10° m).

to confirm the site of action of efs, we investigated the
effects of tetrodotoxin (1077 m) and atropine (10% m) on the re-
sponse to efs. both tetrodotoxin and atropine completely abol-
ished contractions evoked by efs.

 xxxd3017xxx  (10 to 10-7 m) was added after a constant contrac-
tion evoked by efs was obtained. we also measured the ach sen-
sitivity of the smooth muscle in the absence and presence of pro-
caterol.

the following drugs were used in this study: indomethacin,
ach, atropine, tetrodotoxin (sigma),  xxxd3017xxx  (otsuka pharma-
ceutical, tokyo, japan),.  xxxd2243xxx  (tokyo kasei), and
ici-118551 (ici pharmaceuticals).

the results are expressed as arithmetic mean values and stan-
dard errors. we used the paired student t test for statistical analy-
sis and considered differences to be statistically different when the
pvalue was less than 0.05.

effects of  xxxd3017xxx  on twitch contraction of

human bronchi

 xxxd3017xxx  (107° m) reduced the amplitudes of
twitch contractions of human bronchi evoked by efs
applied every 3 min (fig. 1). the effects of  xxxd3017xxx 
(10“° to 10 m) on the amplitude of contractions
evoked by 10 pulses of efs are shown in figure 2

(closed circles).  xxxd3017xxx  (10 to 10 m) sup-
pressed the amplitude of twitch contractions to
70-20% of the control value.

effects of  xxxd3017xxx  on the ach-induced

contractions of the human bronchi

to clarify the site of action of  xxxd3017xxx  on the
bronchial tissues, we examined the effects of procate-
rol on the sensitivity of the smooth muscle cells to
ach. for this purpose, the tension induced by appli-
cation of ach (5x10 m) was measured before and
during application of  xxxd3017xxx  (10 to 10°. m). as
shown in figure 2 (open circles), the amplitude of
ach-induced contractions was unaffected by procate-
rol (10- to 10-° m), indicating that this agent has no
effect on the ach sensitivity of the smooth muscle
cells. at a concentration of 10 m,  xxxd3017xxx  sig-
nificantly suppressed the ach sensitivity of smooth
muscle cells (p <0.05), indicating the postjunctional
action of this agent.

effects of ici-118551 on the action of  xxxd3017xxx 

to clarify the subtype of b,-adrenoceptors in the
vagus nerve terminal, the effects of ici-118551, a
b.-adrenoceptor-blocking agent [14, 15], on the action
of  xxxd3017xxx  were investigated. figure 3 shows the
effects of pretreatment with ici-118551 (10-7 m) on
the action of  xxxd3017xxx  (10- m). in the absence of
ici-118551,  xxxd3017xxx  reduced the twitch amplitude
(ten stimuli at 20 hz). application of ici-118551 itself
slightly reduced the twitch amplitude and suppressed
the action of  xxxd3017xxx . these results indicate that
the inhibitory effects of  xxxd3017xxx  on the twitch
amplitude are mainly due to activation of [-adreno-
ceptors.

discussion

the results presented here show that  xxxd3017xxx  in-
hibits excitatory neuroeffector transmission, presum-
ably by suppressing ach release from the vagus nerve
terminals in the human bronchus, in addition to the
well-documented direct actions on the airway smooth
muscle cells [7-12]. tetrodotoxin abolished the con-
traction evoked by efs, confirming that this contrac-
tion is neurogenic and not myogenic. furthermore,
atropine also abolished efs-evoked contraction, con-
firming that this contraction is mediated by ach. tak-
en together, it was confirmed that efs evokes vagus

nerve stimulation and causes smooth muscle contrac-
tion. since  xxxd3017xxx  (107° to 10° m) significantly
suppressed the amplitude of the twitch contractions
evoked by nerve stimulation without changing the
ach sensitivity of the smooth muscle cells, it presum-
ably acts prejunctionally by suppressing ach release
from the vagus nerve terminals. these results are in
agreement with previous reports [5, 6]. we used 20 hz
for efs. rhoden et al. [6] reported that lower fre-
quencies were more susceptible to inhibition, and it is
possible that  xxxd3017xxx  could be more potent at low-
er frequencies.

in the present study,  xxxd3017xxx  reduced the ampli-
tude of twitch contractions evoked by efs, and this
effect was suppressed by a selective $,-antagonist,
ici-118551. these results suggest the possibility that
b-adrenoceptors exist on the vagus nerve terminals,
in addition to },-adrenoceptors, and that the prejunc-
tional effects of  xxxd3017xxx  are attributed to the acti-
vation of b.-adrenoceptors.

in summary, we demonstrated that  xxxd3017xxx  at
low concentrations has a prejunctional action, inhib-
iting the excitatory neuroeffector transmission and
presumably suppressing transmitter release from the
vagal nerve terminals through b-adrenoceptors in the
human bronchial tissue. it is suggested that the pre-
junctional action of  xxxd3017xxx , in addition to its post-
junctional action, may explain its potent bronchodila-
tor effects.
