abstract
we studied alterations in the mrna expression levels of
 xxxg250xxx  (bcl-2), bcl2l12, bax, fas and caspase-9
genes in the mcf-7 breast cancer cell line in response
to treatment with two anticancer drugs. cell toxicity was
evaluated by the mtt method, trypan blue staining and
dna laddering, whereas the expression levels of the
apoptosis-related genes were analysed by rt-pcr using
gene-specific primers. in the case of etoposide, downregulation of the bcl2l12-a gene variant and of caspase-9, as well as upregulation of bax, was observed,
whereas treatment of mcf-7 cells with taxol led to downregulation of the mrna levels of all genes examined. our
results support the idea that after long-term clinical studies, mrna expression analysis of bcl2l12 and other
members of the  xxxg250xxx  gene family may serve as useful
molecular markers predicting chemotherapy response in
breast cancer.

breast cancer is a clinically heterogeneous disease (murphy et al., 2005). in recent years, arrays of potential prognostic and/or predictive markers of breast cancer have
been analysed, including factors related to different cell
functions, such as proliferation, apoptosis, hormonal regulation, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis (scorilas
et al., 1999a,b; duffy, 2001; yousef et al., 2002, 2003;
kishi et al., 2003). however, relatively few have proven to
be clinically useful. recently, cancer research has
focused on the identification of prognostic and predictive
gene ‘signatures’ for prediction of disease outcome and
response to treatment. therefore, it seems likely that in
the future, expression profiles of specific genes will be

used to provide a rationale for individualised treatment
(jeffrey et al., 2005).
current research supports the hypothesis that impairment of apoptosis is essential for tumourigenesis (evan
and vousden, 2001). apoptosis-related proteins such as
 xxxg250xxx  (anti-apoptotic) have been extensively studied in
breast cancer as both prognostic and predictive markers.
in breast cancer, increased  xxxg250xxx  expression has been
associated with a favourable prognosis after treatment
with chemotherapy and endocrine therapy (fitzgibbons
et al., 2000), while decreased bax expression has been
linked to poor clinical outcome (schorr et al., 1999). in
addition, prognosis for breast cancer patients receiving
adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy strongly
depends on the fas/fasl status (botti, 2004). it has also
been suggested that plasma levels of sfas might be a
valuable clinical prognostic factor in predicting outcome
for patients with metastatic breast cancer undergoing
high-dose chemotherapy treatment (bewick et al., 2001).
bcl2l12 is a novel gene of the  xxxg250xxx  family. it maps
to chromosome 19q13.3 and is located between the
irf3 and prmt/ xxxg1845xxx  genes, close to the rras
gene (scorilas et al., 2001). analysis of bcl2l12 transcripts revealed the existence of two bands in most of
the tissue cdnas examined, one corresponding to the
classical form of the gene and another to a splice variant
(scorilas et al., 2001). clinicopathological investigations
of the relevance of bcl2l12 in human cancers have
been limited. preliminary experiments showed that
bcl2l12 is expressed more often in breast tumours with
a low degree of differentiation, as well as in patients in
the initial stages of the disease (talieri et al., 2003).
important modulations in bcl2l12 mrna levels were
also observed in colon cancer in comparison to paired
normal mucosa (mathioudaki et al., 2004). recent work
in our laboratory showed important alterations in mrna
levels of the gene, depending on both the apoptosis
inducer (anticancer drug) and the specific apoptotic
pathway induced (floros et al., 2003, 2004), implying a
direct relationship between bcl2l12 mrna expression
and apoptosis.
the taxanes taxotere and taxol have been associated
with an improvement in the cure rate in breast cancer
patients at risk of relapse when used in adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (howell and wardley, 2005). furthermore, the activity of etoposide as a single agent has
been assessed in breast cancer, with a number of studies
reporting response rates )20% (bontenbal et al., 1995;
neskovic-konstantinovic et al., 1996; pusztai et al.,
1998). recently, schedules evaluating etoposide and cisplatin treatment of breast cancer patients have shown

high responses, suggesting greater activity with combination treatment (fried et al., 2000). moreover, it has
been found that the combination of cisplatin and etoposide is an active but intensive schedule in heavily pretreated breast cancer patients. a phase iii clinical trial
revealed that a combination of cisplatin and oral etoposide (eop) is more effective than paclitaxel in patients
with advanced breast cancer pretreated with anthracyclines (icli et al., 2005).
etoposide  xxxd1740xxx  and has  xxxg2312xxx 
as its target, disrupting chromosomal dynamics (van
maanen et al., 1988; dwarakanath et al., 2004). it stabilises covalent enzyme-cleaved dna complexes that
accumulate in the cell, causing permanent dna breaks
and apoptosis (baldwin and osheroff, 2005; thomadaki
et al., 2005).
taxol promotes tubulin polymerisation to mircrotubules
(horwitz, 1994). in the presence of this drug, cancer cells
become so clogged with microtubules that they cease to
grow and divide. clinical trials using paclitaxel for the
treatment of advanced breast cancer demonstrated that
the drug is especially effective. the effectiveness of
paclitaxel when used in adjuvant therapy of breast cancer patients was recently investigated by yardley (2005)
and ghersi et al. (2005).
it is known that  xxxg250xxx  and  xxxg251xxx  are phosphorylated
in response to treatment of mcf-7 human breast cancer
cells with taxol, and that procaspase-9 is cleaved into
the active caspase-9 (razandi et al., 2000). levels of the
apoptosis-related proteins  xxxg250xxx  and  xxxg251xxx  increase,
while overexpression of bcl-xs or bax decreases mcf7 cell resistance to drugs (ogretmen and safa, 1996).
treatment of mcf-7 cells with etoposide results in an
increase in bax but not in  xxxg250xxx  mrna levels (leung and
wang, 1999). mcf-7 cells have weak bax gene expression and therefore overexpression of bax sensitises cells
to cisplatin and etoposide (sakakura et al., 1997). induction of caspase activity was also observed in mcf-7 cells

exposed to etoposide, implying that a caspase-3-like
protease is activated in response to dna damage (benjamin et al., 1998).
the purpose of the present study was to concomitantly
analyse the expression profile of selected apoptosisrelated genes in relation to the novel bcl2l12 gene to
provide evidence of its contribution in terms of response
to treatment and the rationale of individualised therapy.
for this reason we selected the breast cancer cell line
mcf-7 and the anticancer drugs etoposide and taxol as
a model.
to determine mcf-7 cell sensitivity to etoposide, cells
were exposed to increasing doses of the drug (34, 68,
102, 136 and 170 mm), for increasing periods of time (6,
12, 24, 48 and 72 h), and cell viability was measured
using the mtt assay. as shown in figure 1, mcf-7 cells
exhibited increased sensitivity to the drug in a dose- and
time-dependent manner.
the cytotoxic effect of taxol on the survival rate of
mcf-7 cells was also evaluated. figure 1 shows the percentage of viable cells as assessed by mtt after cell
treatment with taxol for 24, 48 and 72 h, demonstrating
a dose-dependent decrease in cell survival after 72 h of
treatment. toxic phenomena (cell viability -50%) did not
appear until 72 h of treatment, at which time point concentrations above 60 mm appeared to be toxic. however,
the sensitivity of mcf-7 cells was higher for etoposide
rather than taxol treatment at the concentrations used,
indicating drug dependence of cell response.
as the mtt method quantitatively assesses cell viability but cannot distinguish between growth arrest and
necrosis, we also determined mcf-7 cell viability using
the trypan blue exclusion method (necrosis) after treatment with the drugs. trypan blue staining revealed that
etoposide displayed enhanced necrotic effects in comparison to taxol, causing, in some cases, almost 100%
necrosis of the cells (figure 2). this finding demonstrates
that variation in cell viability assessed by mtt mainly

viability was assessed with the mtt assay after treatment with 0 (), 34 (j), 68 (m), 102 (e), 136 (h) and 170 (n) mm etoposide for
6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h, or with 0 (), 10 (j), 20 (m), 40 (e), 60 (h), 80 (n) and 100 (d) mm taxol for 24, 48 and 72 h. data represent
mean values for two independent experiments.
methods: the human breast cancer cell line, mcf-7, was maintained in rpmi 1640, supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum,
200 u/ml  xxxd2871xxx , 0.1 g/l streptomycin, 0.3 g/l l-glutamine, 10 mg/ml insulin and 0.85 g/l nahco3 in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% co2 at 378c. the mtt assay was used to determine cell viability as described by the manufacturer. briefly, human
breast cancer cells growing in the logarithmic phase were seeded in 96-well plates (2=104 cells in 200 ml of medium/well) in quadruplicate, allowed to attach overnight, and then treated with either drug at 378c in a humidified 5% co2 atmosphere for the time
periods indicated. this was followed by the addition of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (mtt; sigma,
st. louis, mo, usa) to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and further incubation in the same conditions for 4 h to allow mtt to form
formazan crystals in metabolically active cells. the formazan crystals were solubilised overnight at 378c in a solution containing
12.5% sds (sigma) and 45% (v/v) formamide (acros organics, geel, belgium). the absorbance of each cell lysate solution was
measured at 545 nm, using a reference wavelength of 690 nm. results are expressed as the percentage (%) of treated cells versus
untreated cells (mosmann, 1983).

mm of etoposide for 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h, or with 0 (), 10 (j), 20 (m), 40 (e), 60 (h), 80 (n) and 100 (d) mm of taxol for 24, 48
and 72 h. data represent mean values for two independent experiments.
methods: exponentially growing, human breast cancer cells (mcf-7) were seeded at a density of 105 cells/ml (10=105 cells/flask) in
triplicate, allowed to attach overnight, and then treated with etoposide or taxol at 378c in a humidified 5% co2 atmosphere for the
time periods indicated. the cells were then harvested by trypsinisation and a 1:10 dilution of the cell suspension was prepared in
pbs (1=) and 2 ml of 0.4% (w/v) trypan blue stain (sigma) was added to 18 ml of 10= diluted cell suspension. they were mixed
thoroughly and allowed to stand for 5 min at room temperature. the total number of cells and the number of blue-stained cells were
counted on a haemocytometer and the concentration of viable cells per ml of culture was calculated. results are expressed as the
concentration of trypan blue-positive cells. each data point represents the mean for three separate experiments (mean"sd).

reflects necrotic phenomena. in addition, the cell response to both drugs was both dose- and time-dependent.
following screening of the cytotoxic effect of the drugs
etoposide and taxol on mcf-7 cells, one intermediate,
non-toxic concentration was chosen for each drug and
then induction of dna fragmentation (apoptosis) (figure
3) and the expression levels of different apoptosis-related
gene transcripts were studied (bcl2l12, bax,  xxxg250xxx ,
fas, caspase-9).
apoptosis was not detected, since neither drug
induced the characteristic pattern of nucleosome-sized
ladders of dna fragments (indicative of apoptosis), coinciding with previous results (thomadaki et al., 2005) and

samples (106 intact cells/sample) were subjected to electrophoresis on a 2% agarose (sigma) gel, according to the eastman
(1995) protocol. high-molecular-weight (hmw) dna fragments
were trapped in or near the well, whereas dna fragments of low
molecular weight ran and separated through the gel. the gel was

the fact that mcf-7 cells lack caspase-3. interestingly,
both etoposide and taxol were found to induce only
hmw dna fragmentation (as assessed by agarose gel
electrophoresis) in mcf-7 cells after 72 h of exposure
(figure 3). in the mcf-7 cell line, treatment with etoposide leads to shrinkage of both chromatin and whole
cells, without the appearance of endonucleosomal cleavage of dna (thomadaki et al., 2005). such cell response
to etoposide treatment has previously been characterised as a proapoptotic condition of cells that are unable
to implement the apoptotic process (johnson et al.,
2000). it has been shown that inability to cleave dna is
due to a mutation in the caspase-3 gene, resulting in the
expression of inactive caspase-3 in the cell (kurokawa et
al., 1999). activation of caspase-3 in mcf-7 cells indeed
led to the re-establishment of endonucleosomal cleavage
of dna (boldt et al., 2002). according to previous data,
treatment of mcf-7 cells with etoposide also leads to
cleavage of parp, as well as caspase activation,
although it is not yet clear which caspases are actually
involved (benjamin et al., 1998; xue et al., 2003).
total cellular rna was subjected to rt and pcr with
gene-specific primers (table 1). in the case of etoposide
treatment (figure 4; table 2), downregulation of mainly
the bcl2l12-a gene variant was observed after cell
exposure to the drug for 6, 12 and 24 h. mrna downregulation was also observed for caspase-9 after 12 h
of treatment, whereas bax mrna levels showed an
increase (figure 4; table 2), confirming previously published data (gibson et al., 1999; leung and wang, 1999).
for fas and  xxxg250xxx , no changes in mrna levels were
observed (figure 4; table 2).
after treatment of mcf-7 cells with taxol (10 mm) for
24, 48 or 72 h, downregulation of the mrna levels of all
genes examined (bax, bcl-2, bcl2l12, fas, caspase-9) was observed (figure 4; table 2).
according to the present results, distinct cytotoxic
pathways are probably induced as a response to etoposide or taxol treatment. the mrnas of the genes
examined behave differentially, probably according to the
pathway induced. more specifically, in the case of eto-

mcf-7 breast cancer cells were treated with either 34 mm etoposide or 10 mm taxol for the time periods indicated. rt-pcr analysis
of the abundance of mrnas encoding the apoptosis-related genes under study was carried out. total cellular rna was subjected
to rt and pcr with gene-specific primers. pcr products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium
bromide. in lane (b) the upper band represents the classical form of the bcl2l12 gene (556 bp), whereas the lower band is a 413bp splice variant. lane m: dna size marker.
methods: total rna was extracted from mcf-7 cells using trizol reagent (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the concentration and purity of rna were assessed spectrophotometrically at 260 and 280 nm. then 2 mg of
total rna was reverse-transcribed into first-strand cdna using the supersript pre-amplification system (invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. the final reaction volume was 20 ml. based on information on the bax,  xxxg250xxx , bcl2l12, caspase9, fas and b-actin gene sequences, six pairs of gene-specific primers were designed (table 1), and pcr was carried out in a
reaction mixture containing 1 ml of cdna, 10 mm tris-hcl (ph 8.3), 50 mm kcl, 1.5 mm mgcl2, 200 mm dntps, 150 ng of primers
and 2.5 u of dfs-taq dna polymerase (bioron, boca raton, fl, usa) in an eppendorf thermocycler. the cycling conditions were
as follows: a denaturation step at 948c for 2 min, followed by 37–39 cycles of 948c for 30 s, 628c or 658c for 30 s, 728c for 1 min
and a final extension step at 728c for 10 min (table 1). equal amounts of pcr products were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gels
and visualised by ethidium bromide staining. gels were photographed under uv light and images were analysed for the presence
(positive) or absence (negative) of bax, bcl2l12,  xxxg250xxx , caspase-9 or fas gene expression using the nih image program (http:/
/rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). actin was used as an internal control for the integrity of the mrna. each pcr reaction was performed
twice to evaluate the reproducibility of the data.

changes based on quantitative densitometric data, according to
agarose gel band analysis performed using the nih image program, developed at the u.s. national institute of health (http://
rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/).% changesb-a/a=100, where a is
the gene/actin ratio for the control sample and b that for the
sample treated with drug. a positive number indicates an
increase and a negative number a decrease in the level of gene
expression at the mrna level.

the genes examined (bax, bcl-2, bcl2l12, fas, caspase-9) and both the classical and variant forms of
bcl2l12 was observed after treatment of mcf-7 cells
for the time intervals indicated.
this differential response of fas, bax and  xxxg250xxx  transcripts in response to drug treatment could account for
distinct cytotoxic pathways induced by the two drugs,
since they have distinct targets within the cell, with etoposide targeting dna and taxol targeting microtubules.
it could also indicate that the apoptosis-related genes
under study are modified at the mrna level as a
response to treatment, but in a drug- or pathway-specific
manner. in addition, etoposide increased the bax/ xxxg250xxx 
mrna ratio due to an increase of bax mrna expression
in the same cells. these results suggest that the reduction in bcl2l12-a transcription and the increase in bax
expression by etoposide could possibly contribute to its
increased cytotoxicity in this system. however, further
investigation is required to verify this observation.
the differential modulations of bcl2l12 at the mrna
level (downregulation of mainly the bcl2l12-a transcript
as a response to etoposide treatment and downregulation of both the classical form and the bcl2l12-a transcript as a response to taxol treatment) could also
account for differential implications of the gene, according to the cytotoxic pathway induced by each drug. the
distinct changes for the two forms of bcl2l12 could
account for different functional roles, as for the three
splicing variants that have been identified for the  xxxg251xxx 
gene ( xxxg251xxx , bcl-xs, bcl-xy). the forms bcl-xs and
 xxxg251xxx  display striking functional and expressional differences. thus, while the large  xxxg251xxx  transcript is antiapoptotic and mainly expressed in long-lived cells, such
as those of the nervous system, and localises in the peri-

nuclear envelope and mitochondrial membranes, the
smaller bcl-xs protein is expressed in cells with a high
turnover rate, such as those of the immune system, and
acts as an apoptotic activator (thomadaki and scorilas,
2006).
taken together with the fact that most anticancer
drugs take effect through induction/suppression of apoptosis-related gene expression, these results indicate the
necessity of further research into the biological role of
bcl2l12 in response to drug treatment. to the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study examining the
expression of bcl2l12 in relation to  xxxg250xxx , bax, caspase-9 and fas genes under etoposide/taxol treatment
in mcf-7 human breast cancer cells.
the finding that cancer cell response to drug treatment
occurs under a conserved and genetically programmed
mechanism confirms the possibility that selective intervention in a process that can be modulated through the
regulated expression of specific genes, such as  xxxg250xxx 
l12, may influence the course of the disease.
