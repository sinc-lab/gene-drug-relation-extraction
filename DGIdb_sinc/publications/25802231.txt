abstract  xxxd2313xxx  (imbruvicaò) is a first-in-class, potent,
orally administered, covalent inhibitor of bruton’s tyrosine
kinase (btk) that inhibits b-cell antigen receptor signalling downstream of btk. oral  xxxd2313xxx  is indicated for
the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory mantle
cell lymphoma (mcl) or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
(cll) and for the treatment of patients with cll and a
chromosome 17 deletion (del 17p) or tp53 mutation. this
article summarizes pharmacological, efficacy and tolerability data relevant to the use of  xxxd2313xxx  in these
indications. in clinical studies,  xxxd2313xxx  induced a high
overall response rate in patients with relapsed/refractory
mcl (phase ii study). in addition,  xxxd2313xxx  significantly
prolonged progression-free survival and significantly improved the partial response rate and overall survival in
patients with relapsed/refractory cll (resonate study),
including in those with del 17p, a subgroup with a poor
prognosis.  xxxd2313xxx  had an acceptable tolerability profile in
these studies with \10 % of patients discontinuing treatment because of adverse events. given its efficacy and
tolerability, once-daily, oral  xxxd2313xxx  is an emerging
treatment option for patients with relapsed/refractory mcl
or cll and cll patients with del 17p or tp53 mutation.

1 introduction
mantle cell lymphoma (mcl) and chronic lymphocytic
leukaemia (cll) are two b-cell malignancies that affect
more men than women, with a median age at diagnosis that
is commonly over 60 years [1, 2]. mcl is a rare type of
b-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma (nhl) that accounts for
approximately 6 % of all nhls [1]. mcl is typically an
aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis, high recurrence
rates and a median overall survival (os) of up to 5 years
[3, 4]. however, significant variability of the disease course
is recognized [5]. cll is the most prevalent type of leukaemia in western countries [2]. cll is typically an indolent cancer that is not curable with conventional
therapies and has an estimated median os of 10.7 years [6,
7]. a variable disease course is recognized in cll as well
[2]. in cll, approximately 3–8 % of patients at diagnosis
or treatment initiation have deletions in the short arm of
chromosome 17 (del 17p) that usually result in the removal
of an allele in tp53 (the gene encoding for the critical

e. s. kim, s. dhillon

tumour suppressor p53) [8]. patients with del 17p or tp53
mutation have a poor prognosis (median os of 2–3 years)
and respond poorly to conventional therapy [9].
although many patients with mcl or cll respond well
to initial therapy, patients ultimately relapse [4, 10].
treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory disease is
determined by the duration of response after first-line
therapy and should be adapted to the performance status
and age of the patient [5, 11]. treatment options for these
patients include immunochemotherapy (e.g. rituximabcontaining regimens) and molecular targeting agents (e.g.
 xxxd3307xxx  approved in the eu, and bortezomib and lenalidomide approved in the usa) for patients with mcl,
and chemotherapy, immunochemotherapy and monoclonal
antibodies (e.g. rituximab,  xxxd2771xxx ) for patients with
cll [11, 12].
more recently, an improved understanding of the
pathogenesis of these b-cell malignancies has led to the
development of new targeted treatment options for patients
with mcl or cll [13, 14]. with aberrant b-cell antigen
receptor (bcr) signalling implicated in the pathogenesis of
several b-cell malignancies, one such strategy is inhibition
of bruton’s  xxxg2198xxx  (btk) [7, 15]. btk is a
member of the tec kinase family that transmits signals
from various cell surface receptors, most prominently from
the bcr [7, 16]. btk is thought to play a role in the
intermediate stages of the bcr signalling cascade and is
commonly overexpressed in mcl and cll [17–19].
 xxxd2313xxx  (imbruvicaò) is a first-in-class, potent, orally
administered, covalent inhibitor of btk that has been approved in the eu and usa for the treatment of patients
with relapsed/refractory mcl or cll and cll patients
with del 17p or tp53 mutation [20–22]. this article reviews the efficacy and tolerability of  xxxd2313xxx  in the
treatment of patients in these populations and briefly
summarizes its pharmacology.  xxxd2313xxx  has recently been
approved for waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia (wm) in
the usa [20], and a type ii variation application to include
wm as a new indication is pending in the eu [23], but this
indication will not be discussed further as it is outside the
scope of this review.

cysteine residue (cys-481) in the btk active site and irreversibly inhibits bcr signalling downstream of btk
[24].  xxxd2313xxx  reduced the phosphorylation of btk,
plcc2, akt and erk in cll cells in vivo [15, 25] and in
mcl cells in vitro [26]. in addition,  xxxd2313xxx  reduced the
expression of ki67, a marker of proliferation, in mcl and
cll cells in vivo [15, 25, 26].  xxxd2313xxx  inhibited bcr and
nf-jb signalling in cll cells not only in the peripheral
blood but also in the bone marrow and lymph nodes [25].
in patients with b-cell malignancies,  xxxd2313xxx  showed a
btk active-site occupancy rate of c95 % as early as 4 h
after administration [27, 28]. consistent with an irreversible mechanism, btk active-site occupancy was fully
maintained for c24 h [27]. in cll patients,  xxxd2313xxx 
showed time-dependent biological changes that likely occurred between 1 and 15 days after administration [15].
2.2 lymphocytosis
lymphocytosis is a frequently encountered class effect of
bcr-targeting small molecules, including  xxxd2313xxx  [29]. in
clinical studies in mcl and cll patients, treatment with
 xxxd2313xxx  caused transient and reversible increases in lymphocyte counts (i.e. absolute lymphocyte count [5000/ll
and increase of c50 % from baseline), often associated
with a rapid reduction in lymphadenopathy [20, 28–31].
lymphocytosis occurred early during treatment and usually resolved within a median of 8 weeks in mcl patients
and 18.7 weeks in cll patients [21]. this lymphocytosis
is thought to reflect a redistribution of malignant lymphocytes between different anatomical compartments, probably because of a disruption of bcr-mediated stromal
chemotaxis and adhesion [27, 29]. it is very clear and
recommended that in the absence of other clinical findings,
 xxxd2313xxx -induced lymphocytosis should not be considered
progressive disease [21, 29]. prolonged lymphocytosis
(lymphocytosis not normalizing or improving to \50 % of
baseline within 12 months) following  xxxd2313xxx  treatment
has also been observed in some patients but does not appear to adversely affect progression-free survival (pfs)
[32].
2.3 resistance

2 pharmacodynamic properties
2.1 mechanism of action
the phosphorylation and activation of btk by src family
protein kinases (e.g. lyn, syk) leads to plcc2 phosphorylation, calcium mobilization and activation of
downstream pathways (e.g. akt, map kinase, nfjb) that
lead to changes that promote cell differentiation, proliferation and survival [15].  xxxd2313xxx  binds covalently to a

few patients with cll have had a relapse on  xxxd2313xxx 
[33], but recent data suggest that primary and secondary
resistance is common in mcl patients treated with  xxxd2313xxx  [34]. in both mcl and cll, a cysteine-to-serine
missense mutation at the  xxxd2313xxx  binding site of btk
(btkc481s) has been identified following a durable response [33, 35]. this mutation prevents irreversible binding of  xxxd2313xxx  to btk and results in a reduced degree of
b-cell receptor signalling-inhibition by  xxxd2313xxx  in mutant

 xxxd2313xxx : a review

btk compared with nonmutant btk [33]. in cll patients
with acquired resistance to  xxxd2313xxx , plcc2 mutations
(e.g. l845f, r665w, s707y mutations) have been identified in addition to btkc481s [33]. these plcc2 mutations are believed to be gain-of-function mutations that
confer resistance to  xxxd2313xxx  by allowing bcr-mediated
activation that is independent of btk [33]. the absence of
btkc481s in mcl patients with primary resistance or a
transient (\5 months) response to  xxxd2313xxx  and the absence
of both btk or plcc2 mutations before  xxxd2313xxx  exposure
in cll patients who develop acquired resistance suggest
alternative mechanisms contributing to primary or rapid
resistance to  xxxd2313xxx  [33, 35].

there is potential for clinically relevant interactions
between strong or moderate cyp3a4 inhibitors or inducers, and p-glycoprotein substrates with a narrow
therapeutic window [20, 21]. azole antifungals [e.g. fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole,  xxxd3528xxx 
( xxxg590xxx  inhibitors)] may markedly increase  xxxd2313xxx 
plasma concentrations. in addition, the use of  xxxd2313xxx  in
patients receiving anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) or antiplatelets may increase the risk of bleeding. local prescribing information should be consulted for further
information on potential interactions and precautions for
use [20, 21].

4 therapeutic efficacy
3 pharmacokinetic properties
4.1 in patients with relapsed/refractory mcl
the pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd2313xxx  do not differ
significantly between patients with different b-cell malignancies [21, 28]. oral  xxxd2313xxx  is rapidly absorbed, with a
median time to peak plasma  xxxd2313xxx  concentration (cmax)
of 1–2 h [20, 21, 27, 28].  xxxd2313xxx  exposure increased
proportionally with daily doses from 420 mg up to 840 mg
[20, 21, 28]. compared with the fasted state, the administration of  xxxd2313xxx  with food increased the area under the
plasma concentration-time curve by twofold and mean
cmax by two- to fourfold [20].  xxxd2313xxx  had reversible
plasma protein binding of 97.3 % and an apparent volume
of distribution at steady state of &10,000 l [20, 21].
 xxxd2313xxx  is metabolized in the liver primarily by cytochrome p450 (cyp) 3a4, and to a minor extent by
cyp2d6 [20, 21]. the elimination of  xxxd2313xxx , mainly in
the form of metabolites, is primarily via faeces. after a
single oral dose of radiolabelled  xxxd2313xxx , most (90 %) of
the drug was eliminated within 168 h, with 80 % of the
dose excreted in the faeces and\10 % in the urine [20, 21].
 xxxd2313xxx  has a half-life of 4–13 h [21] and an apparent oral
clearance of &1000 l/h in a fed state and &2000 l/h in a
fasted state [20].
 xxxd2313xxx  exposure is increased in patients with hepatic
impairment; therefore, dosage adjustments are required or
the drug should not be used in patients with hepatic dysfunction [20, 21]. no specific studies have been conducted
in patients with renal impairment [21]; however, as  xxxd2313xxx  has minimal renal clearance, dosage adjustments are
not needed in patients with mild to moderate dysfunction
[21].
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2313xxx  were not altered to a
clinically relevant extent based on age, gender and body
weight [20, 21]. the safety and efficacy of  xxxd2313xxx  in
paediatric patients have not been established.  xxxd2313xxx  can
cause fetal harm, so women should avoid becoming pregnant during  xxxd2313xxx  therapy [20, 21].

the efficacy of oral  xxxd2313xxx  in adult patients with relapsed/refractory mcl was evaluated in an open-label,
phase ii trial [31]. key inclusion criteria included a confirmed diagnosis of mcl and at least one prior line of
treatment, with either no partial or better response to or
disease progression after the most recent treatment regimen
[31]. at baseline, 89 % of patients had an eastern cooperative oncology group (ecog) performance status score
of 0 or 1, 39 % had bulky disease (c5 cm) and 49 % were
high-risk patients (as assessed by the simplified mcl international prognostic index) [21, 31]. the median time
since diagnosis was 42 months, and patients had received a
median of three prior treatments [21, 31]. patients were
classified as either bortezomib-naı̈ve (no prior bortezomib
therapy or less than two complete cycles; n = 65) or
bortezomib-experienced (at least two cycles; n = 50) and
received  xxxd2313xxx  560 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable tolerability [31]. efficacy analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of
 xxxd2313xxx  and had at least one post-baseline efficacy
assessment (n = 111). the primary endpoint was overall
response rate (orr), as assessed by the revised international working group criteria for nhl [31].
at an estimated median follow-up of 15.3 months, the
orr with  xxxd2313xxx  was 68 % (complete response rate in
21 % and partial response rate in 47 % of patients) and the
estimated median response duration was 17.5 months [31].
these results were consistent with an independent review
committee’s evaluation, which showed a response rate of
69 % (complete response rate in 21 % and partial response
rate in 48 % of patients) and an estimated median response
duration of 19.6 months. moreover, the response to  xxxd2313xxx  was consistent across patient subgroups, regardless of
prior treatment (e.g. to bortezomib) or underlying risk/
prognostic factors (e.g. bulky disease). the estimated

e. s. kim, s. dhillon

median pfs with  xxxd2313xxx  was 13.9 months, and the median os was not reached. the estimated os rate at
18 months was 58 % [31].
the efficacy of  xxxd2313xxx  was sustained during longerterm therapy. at an estimated median follow-up of
26.7 months, the orr in  xxxd2313xxx  recipients was 67 %
(complete response rate in 22.5 %), and the median response duration was 17.5 months (abstract presentation)
[36]. the median pfs with  xxxd2313xxx  was 13 months and
the median os was 22.5 months (24-month kaplan–meier
pfs and os rates of 31.1 and 47.3 %) [36].
4.2 in patients with relapsed/refractory cll
the efficacy of  xxxd2313xxx  in patients with relapsed/refractory cll was shown in an open-label, multicentre, phase
ib/ii trial [28]. since then, results of a randomized, openlabel, multicentre, phase iii trial (resonate) [30] have
been published. therefore, this section will focus on the
phase iii trial.
the resonate trial enrolled patients with cll or
small lymphocytic lymphoma (sll), who had received at
least one prior treatment and were not considered appropriate candidates for purine analogue treatment [30]. at
baseline, all patients had an ecog performance status of 0
or 1, 58 % of patient had bulky disease (c5 cm) and 32 %
of patients had del 17p [21, 30]. the median time since
diagnosis was 91 months, and the median number of prior
treatments was two [21]. patients were randomized to oral
 xxxd2313xxx  420 mg once daily (n = 195) until unacceptable
toxicity or disease progression occurred or intravenous
 xxxd2771xxx  (n = 196) for up to 24 weeks (300 mg as
initial dose for week 1, followed by 2000 mg once weekly
for 7 weeks then once every 4 weeks for 16 weeks, consistent with local labelling) [30]. of note, the resonate
study excluded patients receiving warfarin but allowed
patients to receive other forms of anticoagulation. during
the study, a protocol amendment allowed  xxxd2771xxx  recipients with disease progression to cross over to receive
 xxxd2313xxx  treatment. the primary endpoint was the duration
of pfs as assessed by the independent review committee
[based on the criteria of the international workshop on
cll (with clarification that patients with lymphocytosis in
the setting of improvement in other parameters should not
be considered to have progressive disease)], and the intentto-treat population was used for the efficacy analysis [30].
at a median follow-up of 9.4 months, in the overall
population (n = 391),  xxxd2313xxx  significantly (p \ 0.001)
prolonged the duration of pfs, with a 78 % reduction in
the risk of disease progression or death compared with
 xxxd2771xxx  [median pfs not reached with  xxxd2313xxx  vs.
8.1 months with  xxxd2771xxx ; hazard ratio (hr) 0.22;
95 % ci 0.15–0.32] [30]. os was also significantly

(p = 0.005) prolonged with  xxxd2313xxx  relative to  xxxd2771xxx  (hr 0.43; 95 % ci 0.24–0.79), corresponding to a
57 % reduction in the risk of death (median os was not
reached in either treatment group). this difference in survival may have been greater, but the detection of this difference was limited due to 57 subjects that crossed over to
receive  xxxd2313xxx . in addition, the orr (as assessed by
independent reviewers) was significantly (p \ 0.001)
higher with  xxxd2313xxx  than with  xxxd2771xxx  [43 vs. 4 %;
odds ratio (or) 17.4; 95 % ci 8.1–37.3]. all responses
were partial responses in both treatment groups, and an
additional 20 % of  xxxd2313xxx  recipients had a partial response with lymphocytosis, bringing the total response rate
with  xxxd2313xxx  to 63 % [30].
the treatment benefit with  xxxd2313xxx  in terms of pfs was
observed regardless of baseline characteristics or molecular
features, including in patients with (hr 0.25; 95 % ci
0.14–0.45) or without (hr 0.19; 95 % ci 0.12–0.32) del
17p13.1 [30]. in patients with del 17p (a subgroup with a
poor prognosis), median pfs was not reached in  xxxd2313xxx 
recipients (n = 63) compared with a median pfs of
5.8 months in  xxxd2771xxx  recipients (n = 64). at
6 months, 83 % of  xxxd2313xxx  recipients in this subgroup
were alive without disease progression compared with
49 % of  xxxd2771xxx  recipients [30]. the orr was 47.6 %
in the  xxxd2313xxx  group, compared with 4.7 % in the  xxxd2771xxx  group, with partial responses seen in all responders
[20]. of note, a phase ii study (resonate-17) of oral
 xxxd2313xxx  420 mg in patients with relapsed/refractory cll
or sll with del 17p (n = 144) showed consistent results
with 79.3 % of patients progression free at 12 months
(abstract presentation) [37].
the benefit of  xxxd2313xxx  therapy was sustained at a median follow-up of 16 months, with significantly longer pfs
in  xxxd2313xxx  than  xxxd2771xxx  recipients (median pfs not
reached vs. 8.1 months; hr 0.106; 95 % ci 0.073–0.153;
p \ 0.0001) [abstract presentation] [38]. at week 24, the
proportion of patients with a clinically meaningful improvement (c3 points) in functional assessment of
chronic illness therapy–fatigue scores did not significantly differ between  xxxd2313xxx  and  xxxd2771xxx  recipients (59 vs. 46 %) [39]. a clinically meaningful
improvement in scores for the european organization for
research and treatment of cancer quality of life questionnaire-c30 was seen in 46 % of  xxxd2313xxx  recipients and
40 % of  xxxd2771xxx  recipients [39].

5 tolerability
 xxxd2313xxx  had an acceptable tolerability profile in clinical
studies in patients with relapsed/refractory mcl or cll.
in pooled data (n = 357) from three trials in patients with

 xxxd2313xxx : a review

mcl or cll, the most common adverse reactions (incidence c20 %) with  xxxd2313xxx  were bruising, constipation,
diarrhoea, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, neutropenia,
pyrexia and upper respiratory tract infection [21]. the most
common grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (incidence c5 %)
were anaemia, neutropenia, pneumonia and thrombocytopenia. adverse reactions (including infections and haematoma) resulted in treatment discontinuations in 6 % of
 xxxd2313xxx  recipients, and 8 % of patients required dosage
adjustments because of these events [21].
in patients with cll, at least one adverse event was
reported in 99 % of  xxxd2313xxx  recipients and 98 % of  xxxd2771xxx  recipients after a median treatment exposure of
8.6 and 5.3 months, respectively [30]. although the median
treatment exposure was longer in  xxxd2313xxx  recipients than
in  xxxd2771xxx  recipients, there was no adjustment for
exposure time. any-grade adverse events occurring in
[15 % of patients in either group are shown in fig. 1. the
most commonly occurring any-grade nonhaematological
adverse event with  xxxd2313xxx  was diarrhoea (48 %, of which
4 % were grade 3–4), and the most commonly occurring
any-grade haematological adverse event with  xxxd2313xxx  was
anaemia (23 %, of which 5 % were grade 3–4) (fig. 1).
any-grade adverse events occurring at a numerically
higher incidence with  xxxd2313xxx  relative to  xxxd2771xxx 
included all infections (70 vs. 54 %), all bleeding-related
events (44 vs. 12 %), pyrexia (24 vs. 15 %), blurred vision
(10 vs. 3 %), rash (8 vs. 4 %), atrial fibrillation (5 vs.
0.5 %) and cataracts (3 vs. 1 %). any-grade adverse events
occurring at a numerically higher incidence with  xxxd2771xxx  relative to  xxxd2313xxx  included infusion reactions (28
vs. 0 %), night sweats (13 vs. 5 %), peripheral sensory
neuropathy (13 vs. 4 %), pruritus (incidence not stated) and
urticaria (incidence not stated) [30].
grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported in 51 % of
 xxxd2313xxx  recipients and in 39 % of  xxxd2771xxx  recipients
in this study [30]. the only grade 3 or 4 adverse event
occurring in [15 % of patients in either group was neutropenia (16 vs. 14 %). other grade 3 or 4 adverse events
occurring in numerically more  xxxd2313xxx  than  xxxd2771xxx 
recipients included atrial fibrillation (3 vs. 0 %) and diarrhoea (4 vs. 2 %). major haemorrhage (adverse event of
grade c3 severity or resulting in red cell transfusion or
hospitalization) occurred in 1 and 2 % of patients in the
corresponding treatment groups. serious adverse events
were reported in 42 % of  xxxd2313xxx  and 30 % of  xxxd2771xxx  recipients. the most commonly occurring serious
adverse events included infections such as pneumonia (9 %
of  xxxd2313xxx  recipients vs. 6 % of  xxxd2771xxx  recipients)
and lung infections (3 vs. 0 %) and cardiac disorders such
as atrial fibrillation (3 vs. 0.5 %). fatal adverse events
(most commonly infections) occurred in 4 % of  xxxd2313xxx 
recipients and 5 % of  xxxd2771xxx  recipients. relatively

few patients in either study group withdrew from treatment
because of adverse events (4 vs. 4 %), and adverse events
resulted in dose reductions in only 4 % of  xxxd2313xxx  recipients [30].
the tolerability profile of  xxxd2313xxx  was similar at a
median follow-up of 16 months with a median treatment
duration of 16 months in  xxxd2313xxx  recipients and 5 months
in  xxxd2771xxx  recipients (abstract presentation) [38].
diarrhoea (51 %), fatigue (33 %) and nausea (32 %) were
the most common any-grade adverse events and neutropenia (18 %) was the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse
event. atrial fibrillation (any grade) was observed in 7 %
of patients receiving  xxxd2313xxx .  xxxd2313xxx  was discontinued
because of adverse events in 7 % of patients [38].
the tolerability profile of  xxxd2313xxx  in patients with mcl
was generally similar to that discussed above [31, 36], with
infection (78 %) and diarrhoea (54 %) being the most
common any-grade adverse events during a median
27 months of follow-up (abstract presentation) [36]. at
27 months, any-grade bleeding occurred in 50.5 % of patients and treatment was discontinued because of adverse
events in 11 % of patients [36].

6 dosage and administration
the recommended dosage of oral  xxxd2313xxx  is 560 mg
once daily for mcl and 420 mg once daily for cll
[20, 21] until disease progression or intolerance by the
patient [21]. upon toxicity resolution, dosing guidelines
allow for  xxxd2313xxx  reinitiation at the original starting
dose [20, 21]. dosage adjustments or drug avoidance
may be required in patients with hepatic dysfunction
[20, 21]. dosage adjustments are not needed in patients
with mild to moderate renal dysfunction [21]. women
should avoid becoming pregnant during  xxxd2313xxx  therapy
[20, 21]. local prescribing information should be consulted for further information, including dosage adjustments, interactions, contraindications, warnings and
precautions.

7 current status of  xxxd2313xxx  in mcl and cll
 xxxd2313xxx  is a first-in-class irreversible inhibitor of btk
(sect. 2) approved in the eu for the treatment of adult
patients with relapsed/refractory mcl, cll with at least
one prior therapy or previously untreated cll (unsuitable
for chemo-immunotherapy) in the presence of del 17p or a
tp53 mutation [21].  xxxd2313xxx  is approved in the usa for
the treatment of mcl or cll patients who have received
at least one prior therapy and for the treatment of cll
patients with del 17p [20].

improved the partial response rate and os in patients with
relapsed/refractory cll (resonate study; sect. 4.2),
including in those with del 17p, a subgroup with a poor
prognosis.  xxxd2313xxx  had an acceptable tolerability profile in
these studies with \10 % of patients requiring dosage adjustments or treatment discontinuation (sect. 5). major
haemorrhage was an adverse event of interest with  xxxd2313xxx  [30]. in the resonate study, all bleeding-related
events of any grade occurred at a numerically higher incidence with  xxxd2313xxx  compared with  xxxd2771xxx , but the
incidence of major haemorrhage was similar between the
two (sect. 5). unexpected major bleeding was not seen
with  xxxd2313xxx  in the resonate study because of adherence to precautions regarding the use of anticoagulants
and antiplatelets as well as perioperative drug-withholding
guidelines [30]. another adverse event of interest with
 xxxd2313xxx  is atrial fibrillation [40]. any-grade, grade 3–4
and serious atrial fibrillations occurred at a numerically
higher incidence with  xxxd2313xxx  compared with  xxxd2771xxx  in the resonate study (sect. 5). one potential explanation, based on a study of rat myocytes, is the
inhibition of cardioprotective pi3k-akt signalling by
 xxxd2313xxx  [40]. however, the effect of  xxxd2313xxx  and the role
of btk on human myocytes has not been demonstrated
[41]. further studies on the impact of  xxxd2313xxx  on cardiac
function are warranted [40].
given  xxxd2313xxx ’s efficacy and tolerability, the recent
european society for medical oncology guidelines for
mcl [12] and the national comprehensive cancer

haematological adverse events

network guidelines for nhl [11] include  xxxd2313xxx  as a
treatment option for relapsed/refractory mcl [11, 12],
relapsed/refractory cll (category 1 recommendation) [11]
and as first-line therapy for cll with del 17p [11].
head-to-head trials comparing  xxxd2313xxx  with other approved agents for relapsed/refractory mcl (e.g. bortezomib, lenalidomide,  xxxd3307xxx ) are needed. although
 xxxd2313xxx  seems to double the orr and pfs compared with
these other agents based on individual trials, the treatment
populations are not directly comparable and comparisons
across trials should be made with caution [42]. evidence
from an indirect analysis using matching-adjusted indirect
comparisons suggested that, in patients with relapsed/refractory mcl,  xxxd2313xxx  recipients had better odds of
achieving an orr than bortezomib (or 3.62; 95 % ci
1.18–11.14) or fcm ( xxxd2120xxx , cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone; or 3.22; 95 % ci 1.01–10.26) recipients (abstract presentation) [43]. results from additional direct
comparative phase iii trials [nct01646021 ( xxxd2313xxx  vs.
 xxxd3307xxx  in relapsed/refractory mcl), nct01973387
( xxxd2313xxx  vs. rituximab in relapsed/refractory cll/sll)]
are awaited with interest.
although  xxxd2313xxx  was approved based on results of
trials assessing the drug as monotherapy [20, 21], combination therapies are being explored for improved disease
control.  xxxd2313xxx  therapy is associated with lymphocytosis,
a class effect of bcr-targeting molecules (sect. 2.2).
 xxxd2313xxx -induced lymphocytosis is generally asymptomatic
and not considered progression of the disease; however,
long-term treatment may be necessary and chances of
achieving complete remission may be reduced [13].
therefore, the use of  xxxd2313xxx  in combination with cd20

 xxxd2313xxx : a review

antibodies [e.g. rituximab,  xxxd2771xxx ,  xxxd2765xxx 
(also known as  xxxd2765xxx )], which can clear malignant cells
from peripheral blood, is being explored [13, 44]. in addition,  xxxd2313xxx  combination studies are also underway to
see if the addition of  xxxd2313xxx  to conventional therapies
would prevent or treat resistant disease [10, 33].
a phase ii study examining  xxxd2313xxx  in combination
with rituximab in high-risk cll patients [patients with
high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities (del 17p, del 11q, tp53
mutation) or poor response to prior chemoimmunotherapy]
showed an orr of 95 %, 18-month pfs in 78 % of all
patients, 18-month os of 84 % in all patients and a short
duration of  xxxd2313xxx -induced lymphocytosis [45]. preliminary results from a phase ii study examining  xxxd2313xxx 
in combination with rituximab in relapsed mcl showed an
orr of 87 % at a median follow-up time of 6.5 months
[46]. of note,  xxxd2313xxx  demonstrated efficacy especially in
patients with lower ki-67 (orr 100 % in all 33 patients
with ki-67 lower than 50 %) [46]. the phase iii helios
trial is examining whether or not  xxxd2313xxx  added to br
( xxxd298xxx  and rituximab) would provide prolonged
disease control compared with br alone in relapsed/refractory cll or sll [47]. a phase ii study comparing
 xxxd2313xxx  monotherapy to  xxxd2313xxx  in combination with
rituximab in patients with relapsed cll is ongoing
(nct02007044). results are awaited with interest.
preliminary evidence suggests that  xxxd2313xxx  is associated
with better health outcomes (projected life years and qualityadjusted life years) than  xxxd2771xxx  in cll patients [48]
and other treatments commonly used in relapsed or refractory mcl patients [49] (abstract presentations). the final
results of these ongoing studies are awaited with interest.
in conclusion, once-daily, oral  xxxd2313xxx  is an emerging
treatment option for patients with relapsed/refractory mcl
or cll and previously untreated cll in the presence of
del 17p or a tp53 mutation.
