native specific activity of glutathione peroxidase ( xxxg943xxx ),
 xxxg946xxx 
( xxxg946xxx ) and  xxxg981xxx  (gr) does not differ
between normo- and hypomotile human sperm samples

dear sir,
in a recent issue of international journal of andrology, appeared
a paper by f. tramer et al. entitled ônative specific activity of
glutathione peroxidase ( xxxg943xxx ), phospholipid hydroperoxide
glutathione peroxidase ( xxxg946xxx ) and  xxxg981xxx  (gr)
does not differ between normo- and hypo motile human sperm
samplesõ (tramer et al., 2004).
a major conclusion of the study concerns the measurement of
 xxxg946xxx , the seleno peroxidase, discovered in our laboratory in
1982 (ursini et al., 1982) and recently brought to the focus
for the physiological relevance in spermatogenesis and (ursini
et al., 1999) the diagnostic value in infertility (foresta et al.,
2002).
arguing against our data, tramer et al. reached the conclusion
that: (i) no reductive ôrescuingõ procedure is required to measure the
activity; inferring that the enzyme is not inactivated during the
formation of the mitochondrial capsule; (ii) the specific activity does
not correlate with the motility of spermatozoa.
granted that we agree that a scientific debate is fundamental for
the progress of science and that solid and validated results must be
always open for fruitful discussion, we are sorry to recognize that in
the paper of tramer et al., the conclusions are drawn on grossly
incorrect analytical data.
because of the relevance of the scientific issue, an aspect on
which we do agree with the authors, we feel on duty to clarify at
least the experimental analytical evidence, which must be unambiguous to allow the scientific community to reach its own
unbiased conclusions.
a part minor imprecision (in our opinion) in reviewing the
background, on which we do not argue, the major drawback of the
study of tramer et al. is in the methodology for measuring
glutathione peroxidases.
all the measurements of specific activity of the two peroxidases
( xxxg943xxx  and  xxxg946xxx ) are incorrect for the following reasons:
1 it is not correct to ascribe to  xxxg943xxx  the activity observed with
t-butylhydroperoxide. this substrate is indeed reduced by
both  xxxg943xxx  and  xxxg946xxx  (ursini et al., 1995). in order to have
a valid value of the specific activity of  xxxg943xxx , a gel permeation
chromatography must be carried out in order to separate the
two enzymes (maiorino et al., 1998).

2 running the blank of the peroxidic reaction only in the
absence of the peroxidic substrate severely bias the results,
particularly when a very low activity is measured. hydroperoxides, indeed, are non-enzymatically reduced by nucleophiles such as glutathione. the rate of this spontaneous
reaction, in the adopted conditions, is in the range of
1–4 lm/min, depending on the nature and concentration of
the substrate used. thus, the reported enzymatic activity is
in the same range of the spontaneous reaction (table 1, and
fig. 1). incidentally, this ôbackgroundõ reaction is faster for
t-butylhydroperoxide than for phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide thus explaining the higher ôgpx-1 vs  xxxg946xxx 
activityõ reported in fig. 1. apparently, the authors are
mainly measuring a background instead a real enzymatic
reaction.
3 the decrease of optical density per minute is incompatible
with a valid measurement of an enzymatic activity. in the
enzymatic activity test, the authors use 5 · 105 cells and the
reported specific activity is 1.52 mu per 1 · 106 cells. from
these data we can calculate that they measure a decrease of od
(ddo) of 0.0047 au per min (calculated on e of nadph ¼
6.22/m/cm and 1 ml of volume). from such a tiny decrease, a
precise evaluation of an enzymatic activity is just impossible!
the reported value, indeed, accounts simply for the sum of the
instrumental noise (and possibly drift) plus the background.
the trace of activity present in the sample, if any, cannot be
detected under these analytical conditions. on top of this, as
authors refer to the stirring of the reaction mixture, the
volume of the reaction mixture in the cuvette (not reported in
the paper) must be 2.5–3 ml; thus the ddo/min must be 2.5–
3 times lower than the above value!
4 the recalculation of specific activity results per mg of protein
is incorrect. in the discussion, without presenting original data,
the authors recalculate the specific activity per mg of proteins
to compare their results with ours. obviously, a serious
comparison requires the standardization of experimental
conditions such as substrate and reagent concentration,
temperature and method of evaluation of protein concentration. in particular, the precise evaluation of protein concentration is a major issue, as the exhaustive solubilization of cells

letter to the editor

is critical and an under estimation of protein content would
produce an erroneously higher specific activity. the reported
value of 190.5 mu/mg of protein indicates that 1.25 · 108
cells contain 1 mg of protein. this value is extremely low and
can be rationalized only by considering that spermatozoa are
not fully solubilized. in conclusion, the authors use an
incorrectly low protein concentration to calculate a specific
activity using an incorrect substrate consumption rate. as a
further, although minor, pitfall tramer et al. compare activities
measured at different temperature (foresta et al., 2002; roveri
et al., 2002). the sum of mistakes compensating to each other,
gives, just by chance, a result similar to those obtained in our
laboratory by the validated ôrescuingõ procedure (foresta et al.,
2002; roveri et al., 2002).

in conclusion, the authors, by normalizing an extremely low
reaction rate – not corrected for a relatively relevant background –
for very low and imprecise amount of protein generate a result only
apparently meaningful. obviously, this artefactual result does not
result related to motility of spermatozoa.
based on all these considerations, we conclude that the results
reported in the paper of tramer et al. are wrong. it follows that are
wrong as well the comments about the validity of our previous
procedure concerning: (i) the need of a ôreactivationõ of  xxxg946xxx  in
spermatozoa before measuring activity and (ii) relationship between
 xxxg946xxx  specific activity and functional parameters.
