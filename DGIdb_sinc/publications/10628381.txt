microvessel density and endothelial cell proliferation after  xxxd142xxx  ( xxxd142xxx ) administration in vivo.  as  xxxd142xxx  is rapidly metabolised by the membrane-bound and capillary alkaline phosphatase to the active metabolite wr-1065, microvessel density in normal and cancer tissue may influence the therapeutic potential of the pro-drug  xxxd142xxx . thus, it is of interest how the administration of  xxxd142xxx  itself alters vascular density.
