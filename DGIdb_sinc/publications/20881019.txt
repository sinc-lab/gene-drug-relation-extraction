introduction
pyrethroids are synthetic insecticidal compounds that resemble pyrethrins, natural toxins present in the flowers of
chrysanthemum sp. pyrethroids account for approximately
one-fourth of the insecticide market worldwide (casida and
quistad, 1998), and evidence indicates that use of these
compounds is increasing (amweg et al., 2005; spurlock and
lee, 2008). this usage results in an increased potential for
human exposure, including exposures to pregnant women,
infants, and children (whyatt et al., 2002; morgan et al.,
2007). based on both their chemical structures and biological
effects of high-dose acute exposure, pyrethroids are classified

effect on [ca2⫹]i. these pyrethroids displayed a range of efficacies on ca2⫹ influx; however, the ec50 values for active
pyrethroids all were within one order of magnitude. tetrodotoxin blocked increases in [ca2⫹]i caused by all nine active
pyrethroids, indicating that the effects depended on vgsc
activation. the pathways for deltamethrin- and tefluthrin-induced ca2⫹ influx include n-methyl-d- xxxd233xxx  receptors,
l-type ca2⫹ channels, and reverse mode of operation of the
na⫹/ca2⫹ exchanger inasmuch as antagonists of these sites
blocked deltamethrin-induced ca2⫹ influx. these data demonstrate that pyrethroids stimulate ca2⫹ entry into neurons subsequent to their actions on vgscs.

into two major groups: type i pyrethroids lack a cyano group
at the ␣ carbon of the 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol moiety and
produce a poisoning syndrome consisting of hyperexcitation,
tremors, and convulsions (t syndrome), whereas type ii pyrethroids have a cyano group at the ␣ carbon of the 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol moiety and produce a syndrome consisting of hypersensitivity, choreoathetosis, salivation, and
seizures (cs syndrome). there are a few pyrethroids that
produce mixed signs, including both tremors and salivation,
and these are classified accordingly as type i/ii (verschoyle
and barnes, 1972; barnes and verschoyle, 1974; verschoyle
and aldridge, 1980).
voltage-gated sodium channels (vgscs) are responsible
for the rapid influx of sodium that underlies the rising phase
of the action potential in most electrically excitable cells,
including neurons. vgscs represent the molecular target for
a broad range of potent neurotoxins that bind specifically to
at least six distinct receptor sites (sites 1– 6) on the sodium
channel ␣-subunit and affect the permeability and gating of
the channel (catterall et al., 2007). pyrethroids bind to a site

abstract
pyrethroid insecticides bind to voltage-gated sodium channels
(vgscs) and modify their gating kinetics, thereby disrupting
neuronal function. pyrethroids have also been reported to alter
the function of other channel types, including activation of
voltage-gated calcium channels. therefore, the present study
compared the ability of 11 structurally diverse pyrethroids to
evoke ca2⫹ influx in primary cultures of mouse neocortical
neurons. nine pyrethroids (tefluthrin, deltamethrin, ␭-cyhalothrin, ␤-cyfluthrin, esfenvalerate, s-bioallethrin, fenpropathrin,
cypermethrin, and bifenthrin) produced concentration-dependent elevations in intracellular calcium concentration ([ca2⫹]i) in
neocortical neurons. permethrin and resmethrin were without

(u73122) were from tocris bioscience (ellisville, mo). the pyrethroids used in this study are the same compounds used by wolansky
et al. (2006), and information on the source and isomer composition
are provided therein.
the compounds used were (purity): deltamethrin (98.9%), ␤-cyfluthrin (99.2%), cypermethrin (88%), permethrin (96%), bifenthrin
(95%), esfenvalerate (98.6%), ␭-cyhalothrin (87.7%), tefluthrin (92.6%),
fenpropathrin (91.8%), resmethrin (92.3%), and s-bioallethrin (95.6%).
these are the same compounds as used by wolansky et al. (2006).
compound preparation. each pyrethroid was dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso) at a stock concentration of 100 mm. an
aliquot of stock solution of each pyrethroid was then diluted using
dmso to give a series of secondary stock solutions of 30, 10, 3, 1, 0.3,
0.1, and 0.03 mm. these secondary stock solutions were kept at
⫺20°c in the dark. before each experiment an equal volume of
pluronic acid f-127 (20% in dmso) was then mixed with the secondary stock solution and diluted 250-fold by using locke’s buffer
(8.6 mm hepes, 5.6 mm kcl, 154 mm nacl, 5.6 mm glucose, 1.0
mm mgcl2, 2.3 mm cacl2, 0.0001 mm glycine, ph 7.4). this dilution
in locke’s buffer resulted in solutions of pyrethroid that were four
times the desired final concentrations in the assay. the final concentration of dmso was 0.2% for all chemicals, and this was without
effect on [ca2⫹]i measurements.
neocortical neuron culture. all animal use protocols were
approved by the creighton university institutional animal care and
use committee. primary cultures of neocortical neurons were obtained from embryonic day 16 swiss-webster mice as described by
cao et al. (2007). in brief, pregnant mice were euthanized by co2
asphyxiation, embryos were removed from the dam, and their neocortices were collected. isolated neocortices were then removed of
their meninges, minced by trituration using a pasteur pipette, and
treated with trypsin for 25 min at 37°c. the cells were then dissociated by two successive trituration and sedimentation steps in soybean  xxxd207xxx  and dnase-containing isolation buffer, centrifuged, and resuspended in eagle’s minimal essential medium with
earle’s salt and supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% fetal
bovine serum, 10% horse serum, 100 i.u./ml penicillin, and 0.10
mg/ml streptomycin, ph 7.4. cells were plated onto poly-l-lysinecoated 96-well (9 mm) clear-bottomed black plates at a density of
1.5 ⫻ 105 cells/well (⬃500,000 cells/cm2). plates were incubated at
37°c with 5% co2 and 95% humidity.  xxxd1790xxx  (10 ␮m)
was added to the culture medium on day 2 after plating to prevent
proliferation of non-neuronal cells. the culture medium was changed
on days 5 and 7 by using a serum-free growth medium containing
neurobasal medium supplemented with b-27, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.10 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.2 mm l-glutamine. neocortical
cultures were used in experiments between 8 and 10 days in vitro
(div).
measurement of intracellular calcium concentration. the
culture medium from neocortical neurons in 96-well clear-bottomed
black plates was removed and replaced with dye loading buffer (100
␮l/well) containing 4 ␮m fluo-3 and 0.04% pluronic f-127 in locke’s
buffer. after 1-h incubation in dye loading buffer, cells were washed
five times with locke’s buffer using an automated cell washer
(biotek instruments, winooski, vt), leaving a final volume of 150 ␮l
in each well. the plate was then transferred to a fluorescence laser
plate reader (molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca) chamber. cells
were excited at 488 nm, and ca2⫹-bound fluo-3 emission in the 500to 600-nm range was recorded. fluorescence readings were taken
once every 3 s for 2 min to establish the baseline, and then 50 ␮l of
test compound solution (4⫻) was added to each well from the
compound plate, yielding a final volume of 200 ␮l/well. the cells
were exposed to test compounds for another 13 min. background
fluorescence was automatically subtracted from all fluo-3 fluorescence measurements.

on the sodium channel ␣-subunit that is distinct from sites 1
to 6 (catterall et al., 2007) and affect nervous system function by altering their normal gating kinetics (narahashi,
1996; soderlund et al., 2002). as such, vgscs are the primary molecular targets for pyrethroid’s insecticidal activity
and their acute neurotoxicity in vertebrates (soderlund et al.,
2002).
in addition to their actions on vgscs, pyrethroids have
been reported to interact with other ion channel types in a
variety of in vitro systems, including altering the function of
voltage-gated calcium channels (vgccs) (soderlund et al.,
2002; clark and symington, 2007; neal et al., 2010). however, the extent to which actions on vgccs contribute to
pyrethroid neurotoxicity remains to be clarified (shafer and
meyer, 2004). for example, electrophysiological assessments
have reported either inhibition (allethrin; hildebrand et al.,
2004) or facilitation (deltamethrin; symington et al., 2008) of
current through calcium channels expressed in hek cells
and oocytes, respectively. furthermore, deltamethrin-induced increases in [ca2⫹]i and glutamate release measured
in synaptosomal preparations (symington et al., 2005) were
not replicated in intact neurons in vitro (meyer and shafer,
2006) and may depend on phosphorylation status of the channel (symington et al., 2007). these uncertainties regarding
pyrethroid actions on vgcc function confound a better understanding of how effects on vgccs may contribute to pyrethroid acute neurotoxicity (shafer and meyer, 2004). it has
been proposed that, in addition to actions on vgsc, pyrethroid effects on vgcc may constitute a separate key initiating event in pyrethroid neurotoxicity (soderlund et al.,
2002; breckenridge et al., 2009). thus, the extent to which
actions of pyrethroids on vgcc observed in non-neuronal/
nonmammalian or subcellular fractions can be replicated in
intact neurons will inform the robustness of proposed modes
of action involving direct effects on vgcc. to date, studies of
the actions of pyrethroids on calcium channel function in
intact neurons are lacking, particularly those in which actions on voltage-gated sodium channel function are also
available. consequently, the calcium-responsive fluorescent
dye fluo-3 was used in the present studies to compare the
effects of 11 structurally diverse pyrethroids on [ca2⫹]i in
primary cultures of neocortical neurons. the use of intact
neurons allows for measurement of pyrethroid effects on
vgcc function in a manner that preserves intracellular
modulation of ion channel function such as by phosphorylation. in addition, the use of primary cultures of mammalian
neurons provides a model system that is more relevant to
mammalian neurotoxicity than clonal cell lines or mammalian or nonmammalian expression systems (e.g., hek cells or
oocytes, respectively), because the native complement of ion
channels and other proteins will be present in this system.

pyrethroid-induced calcium influx
data analysis. time-response and concentration-response relationships were generated by using prism software (graphpad software,
inc., san diego, ca). the potency and efficacy values for pyrethroidinduced calcium influx were determined by nonlinear regression analysis. a three-parameter logistic equation was used to fit the concentration-response data: y ⫽ bottom ⫹ (top ⫺ bottom)/(1 ⫹ 10(logec50⫺x)). in
this equation, x is the logarithm of the agonist concentration and y is the
response. the variable bottom is the y value at the bottom plateau; top is
the y value at the top plateau, and logec50 is the logarithm of the ec50
value (50% effective concentration). statistical significance was determined by an anova and, where appropriate, a dunnett’s multiple comparison test was performed to compare responses of vehicle
and pyrethroid-induced calcium influx values.

2008). by contrast, the neurotoxicity induced by brevetoxins,
sodium channel neurotoxin site 5 agonists, is primarily
through the indirect activation of nmda receptors with attendant ca2⫹ influx in cerebellar granule cells (berman and
murray, 2000). radioligand binding and electrophysiological
experiments have revealed that the pyrethoid binding site is
intrinsic to the sodium channel ␣ subunit (smith and soderlund, 1998; choi and soderlund, 2006). primary cultures of
neocortical neurons at div 10 to 13 display synchronized
spontaneous ca2⫹ oscillations that are associated with action
potential generation (fig. 1). the ability of 11 pyrethroids to
stimulate ca2⫹ influx was examined in these div 10 to 13
neocortical neurons. as a positive control for activation of
ca2⫹ influx secondary to activation of vgscs, neocortical
neurons were treated with veratridine, a sodium channel
activator. as illustrated in fig. 1, deltamethrin produced a
robust ca2⫹ influx in a concentration-dependent manner
(fig. 1). similar to deltamethrin, five additional pyrethroids
(tefluthrin, ␭-cyhalothrin, ␤-cyfluthrin, esfenvalerate, and

ttx in the presence of a fixed concentration (30 ␮m) of the
type i pyrethroid, tefluthrin, or a type ii pyrethroid, deltamehtirn. as depicted in fig. 5a, titration with ttx produced
a concentration-dependent reduction in the deltamethrininduced integrated fluo-3 response with an ic50 value of 24.5
nm [15.5–38.8, 95% confidence interval (95% ci)]. likewise,
ttx concentration dependently inhibited tefluthrin (30 ␮m)induced ca2⫹ influx with an ic50 value of 3.75 nm (2.68 –
5.24, 95% ci) (fig. 5b). these data indicate that ttx has
nanomolar potency in blocking both type i and ii pyrethroidinduced calcium influx. as shown in fig. 6, ttx (1 ␮m)
abrogated ca2⫹ influx stimulated by all of the other active
pyrethroids (30 ␮m). these data demonstrate that pyrethroid-induced ca2⫹ influx is secondary to the activation of
vgsc. ttx also eliminated veratridine-induced ca2⫹ influx
in neocortical neurons (fig. 6).

channel neurotoxin site 5 activator, brevetoxin, stimulates
ca2⫹ influx through nmda receptors, l-type ca2⫹ channels,
and reversed na⫹/ca2⫹ exchange (berman and murray,
2000). it was therefore of interest to determine the ca2⫹
influx routes in neocortical neurons after pyrethroid exposure. we used both a type i pyrethroid, tefluthrin, and a type
ii compound, deltamethrin, as representative probes to explore the calcium influx pathways because of their high relative efficacies. as shown in supplemental fig. 2, the nmda
receptor antagonist mk-801 and the l-type ca2⫹ channel
antagonist nifedipine produced concentration-dependent

fenpropathrin) produced substantial elevations of neuronal
[ca2⫹]i in neocortical neurons (fig. 2), as did the vgsc
activator veratridine (supplemental fig. 1). three pyrethroids (s-bioallethrin, cypermethrin, and bifenthrin) produced very little in neuronal [ca2⫹]i in neocortical neurons
(fig. 3). the ca2⫹ influx response to the active pyrethroids
was rapid and sustained for at least 5 min with the exception
of s-bioallethrin. s-bioallethrin-induced ca2⫹ influx recovered to baseline levels within 2 min. two pyrethroids, resmethrin and permethrin, were without effect on ca2⫹ influx
(fig. 3). the concentration-response (area under the curve)
relationships fit by nonlinear regression analysis are depicted
in fig. 4. the ec50 values for pyrethroid-induced ca2⫹ influx
were within one order of magnitude ranging from 1.93 (esfenvalerate) to 15.7 ␮m (tefluthrin). pyrethroid-induced ca2⫹ influx also displayed a range of efficacies. the potencies (ec50
values) and efficacies of these nine active pyrethroids and veratridine on ca2⫹ influx are summarized in table 1. all of the
cyano-containing compounds were slightly more potent than
veratridine, although their efficacies were lower. the noncyano
pyrethroids all were less potent than veratridine. the rank

pyrethroid-induced ca2ⴙ influx in neocortical neurons is ttx sensitive. to determine whether pyrethroidinduced ca2⫹ influx in neocortical neurons was secondary to
activation of vgsc, or triggered by direct actions on voltagegated calcium channels, we first performed a titration with

partial inhibition of deltamethrin-induced ca2⫹ influx. a 1
␮m concentration of mk-801 or nifedipine was sufficient to
produce maximal response. kbr-7943 has been shown to
selectively inhibit the reverse mode of operation of the
plasma membrane na⫹/ca2⫹ exchanger (iwamoto et al.,
1996). a concentration of 3 ␮m kbr-7943 has been demonstrated to attenuate brevetoxin-induced ca2⫹ influx in cerebellar granule cells (berman and murray, 2000). we therefore used a single concentration of mk-801 (1 ␮m), nifedipine
(1 ␮m), or kbr-7943 (3 ␮m) to evaluate the calcium pathways for deltamethrin- and tefluthrin-induced ca2⫹ influx.
mk-801 (1 ␮m) produced a significant reduction in the area
under the fluo-3 fluorescence curve after deltamethrin (30
␮m) exposure. nifedipine (1 ␮m) and kbr-7943 (3 ␮m) also
significantly reduced deltamethrin-induced ca2⫹ influx. nifedipine together with mk-801 or kbr-7943 produced addi-

tive reductions in deltamethrin-induced ca2⫹ influx. likewise, mk-801 produced a significant additional reduction in
[ca2⫹]i when combined with kbr-7943. pretreatment with
mk-801, nifedipine, and kbr-7943 together produced a
nearly complete inhibition in deltamethrin-induced ca2⫹ influx (fig. 7a). similar results were observed for pharmacological antagonism of tefluthrin-induced ca2⫹ influx (fig.
7b). thus, the major routes of ca2⫹ entry after deltamethrin
or tefluthrin exposure in neocortical neurons were similar
and involve nmda receptors, l-type ca2⫹ channels, and
reversed na⫹/ca2⫹ exchange and therefore were similar to
that previously observed for brevetoxin-induced ca2⫹ influx
in cerebellar granule cells (berman and murray, 2000). to
further explore the ca2⫹ source for pyrethroid-induced elevation of [ca2⫹]i, we evaluated the role of extracellular ca2⫹
and intracellular ca2⫹ stores in the response to delta-

methrin. as depicted in fig. 8, decreasing the extracellular
ca2⫹ concentration from 2.3 to 0.2 mm produced a significant
reduction on deltamethrin-induced elevation of [ca2⫹]i. complete removal of extracellular ca2⫹ eliminated the deltamethrin-induced elevation of [ca2⫹]i (fig. 8). in contrast,
depletion of intracellular ca2⫹ stores by preincubation with
thapsigargin (1 ␮m) for 1 h was without effect on the response to deltamethrin (fig. 9). one of the main routes for
the release of ca2⫹ from intracellular ca2⫹ store is the activation of inositol(1,4,5)triphosphate (ip3) receptors located
on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. as depicted
in fig. 9, 2-apb (10 ␮m), an  xxxg1215xxx  antagonist, was

without effect on the response to deltamethrin. the level of
ip3 is regulated by phospholipase c (plc) activity. plc
catalyzes the cleavage of membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate into the second messengers ip3 and
diacylglycerol. we therefore evaluated the influence of a plc
inhibitor u73122 on the response to deltamethrin. pretreatment with u73122 (3 ␮m) had no significant effect on deltamethrin-induced elevation of [ca2⫹]i in neocortical neurons
(fig. 9). a similar pharmacological profile was observed for
tefluthrin-induced elevation of [ca2⫹]i in neocortical neurons
(data not shown). considered together, these data suggest
that, rather than the release of ca2⫹ from intracellular
stores, deltamethrin and tefluthrin stimulation of [ca2⫹]i is
derived primarily from extracellular ca2⫹ influx through
nmda receptors, l-type ca2⫹ channels, and reversed na⫹/
ca2⫹ exchange.

the present experiments demonstrate that in mouse neocortical neurons pyrethroid insecticides activate a ttx-sensitive ca2⫹ influx with differing potencies and efficacies.
these results indicate that the pyrethroid-induced activation
of ca2⫹ channels in neocortical neurons is a secondary, not
primary, event.
we found that 9 of 11 pyrethroids increased [ca2⫹]i in a
concentration-dependent manner. these same pyrethroids
also had distinct maximum efficacies to increase ca2⫹ influx,
whereas their potencies were within one order of magnitude.
the rank order of potency for the nine compounds was esfenvalerate ⬎ cypermethrin ⬎ ␭-cyhalothrin ⫽ ␤-cyfluthrin ⬎
fenpropathrin ⬎ deltamethrin ⬎ s-bioallethrin ⬎ bifenthrin ⬎
tefluthrin. these relative potency rankings agree well with the
relative potencies for inhibition of motor activity by the same 11
compounds, in which the cyano-containing compounds were
generally more potent than the noncyano-containing compounds (wolansky et al., 2006). the greater potency of the
cyano-containing compounds in both assays is also consistent
with the relatively more potent ld50 values of these compounds. resmethrin and permethrin were without effect on
ca2⫹ influx in the present experiments, and s-bioallethrin
produced only a modest, transient ca2⫹ influx. these compounds were also the least potent in a motor activity assay
(wolansky et al., 2006), stimulation of sodium influx (cao et
al., 2009), and inhibition of spontaneous network activity
(johnstone et al., 2009). the small and transient ca2⫹ influx
produced by bioallethrin could be caused by its inhibition of
voltage-gated calcium channels, inasmuch as hildebrand et
al. (2004) demonstrated that allethrin, an isomeric mixture,

pressed in hek293 cells. however, neal et al. (2010) have
demonstrated that allethrin has both stimulatory and inhibitory actions, depending on the vgcc type investigated.
the action of pyrethroids on sodium channels is temperature-dependent, and the sensitivity to pyrethroid exposure
can be augmented by lowering temperature (motomura and
narahashi, 2000). we confirmed a modest temperature de-

pendence for deltamethrin-induced ca2⫹ influx in neocortical
neurons. lowering the temperature from 37 to 22°c produced a 2.6-fold increase in the potency for deltamethrininduced ca2⫹ influx (supplemental fig. 3).
the nine pyrethroids that stimulated ca2⫹ influx displayed distinct efficacies. the rank order of efficacy for ca2⫹
influx was similar to that for sodium influx (cao et al., 2009)
with the exception of s-bioallethrin, which is the least efficacious compound on ca2⫹ influx. in rat primary cortical
cultures, pyrethroids, including fenvalarate, cypermethrin,
cyfluthrin, and deltamethrin, differentially increase bdnf
mrna expression levels by 15- to 150-fold over control
(imamura et al., 2006). this effect was thought to be triggered primarily through ca2⫹ influx associated with the
activation of ttx-sensitive vgscs (imamura et al., 2006).
the present results are consistent with this mode of action
for activation of bdnf expression. in contrast, permethrin
was reported to be inactive in its ability to stimulate bdnf
mrna expression in rat cortical neurons (imamura et al.,
2006). therefore, the distinct abilities of pyrethroids to elevate bdnf mrna expression are consistent with the demonstration of a range of pyrethroid efficacies in the stimulation of ca2⫹ influx. in vivo, deltamethrin has been reported
to increase bdnf in the cortex and hippocampus (imamura
et al., 2006), and both deltamethrin and permethrin alter
transcription profiles of activity-dependent genes in the cortex including c-fos, egr1, and  xxxg326xxx  (harrill et al., 2008).
thus, activity-dependent changes in gene transcription after
pyrethroid exposure can occur both in vitro and in vivo.

cao et al.

our data demonstrate that pyrethroid-induced ca2⫹ influx
depends on the activation of ttx-sensitive vgscs inasmuch
as the response was abrogated by ttx, a sodium channel
blocker. ca2⫹ influx induced by both type i and type ii
compounds occurred secondarily to activation of vgscs. in
addition, the parallel rank orders of efficacy between pryethroid-induced na⫹ (cao et al., 2009) and ca2⫹ influx, with
the exception of s-bioallethrin, indicates that these pyrethroids have no direct effect on vgccs in neocortical neurons. these data in intact neurons are in contrast to previous
reports of direct effects of pyrethroids on vgccs. these
include demonstrations that type i compounds inhibit vgcc
function (hagiwara et al., 1988; someya and yoshino 1990;
hildebrand et al., 2004) as well as reports that type ii compounds increase ca2⫹ flux into synaptosomes in a ttx-insensitive manner (symington et al., 1999) or increase currents through vgccs (duce et al., 1999; symington et al.,
2007). using rat brain synaptosomes, symington et al. (2008)
examined a group of 11 pyrethroids for their ability to stimulate high potassium-induced ca2⫹ influx and glutamate
release. for the 10 compounds common to these studies, five
were reported in both studies to increase ca2⫹ entry (esfenvalerate, cypermethrin, ␭-cyhalothrin, ␤-cyfluthrin, and deltamethrin). however, there were divergent responses for the
remaining five compounds; permethrin was reported to stimulate ca2⫹ influx in synaptosomes, whereas bioallethrin,
tefluthrin, and fenpropathrin were without effect, and
bifenthrin was effective only at high concentrations (symington et al., 2008). the ttx sensitivity of ca2⫹ influx induced
by the compounds tested by symington et al. (2008) was not

examined. a number of factors may contribute to these discordant results, including the use of neuronal subcompartments (synaptosomes) (symington et al., 1999, 2008), insect
neurons (duce et al., 1999), or the method of vgcc stimulation (kcl depolarization: symington et al., 1999; depolarizing voltage steps: duce et al., 1999; hagiwara et al., 1988;
someya and yoshino 1990, symington et al., 2008). neal et
al. (2010) have demonstrated that allethrin increased the
amplitude of ␻-conotoxin gvia-insensitive (predominantly
l-type), but decreased the amplitude of  xxxd2728xxx -insensitive (predominantly n-type) calcium currents in pc12 cells.
these results suggest that the subunit composition and/or
post-translational modifications that may take place in mammalian neurons, but not other expression systems, also influence the nature of interactions between pyrethroids and
vgccs.
the present study used mammalian neocortical neurons
that display spontaneous activity with no “external” stimulus
(such as high potassium or voltage steps) required to activate
vgccs. furthermore, the vgcc response was not isolated
from the effects of pyrethroids on other channel types as is
the case in patch-clamp recordings. therefore, the present
results demonstrate that vgcc responses of a neuronal network to pyrethroids are secondary to activation of vgscs.
numerous studies that have focused specifically on vgcc
function have reported pyrethroid effects in synaptosomes,
oocytes, hek cells, and other systems. however, a limited
number of studies have attempted to examine potential roles
of vgcc in pyrethroid effects using intact mammalian neuronal systems and in all cases failed to demonstrate a significant primary role for vgcc in pyrethroid effects (meyer and
shafer, 2006; meyer et al., 2008). increased neurotransmitter release has been demonstrated after pyrethroid exposure
in vivo (hossain et al., 2004, 2005, 2008; mubarak hossain,
2006). however, it is unclear whether this is caused by direct
effects of these compounds on presynaptic vgccs, or
whether it is secondary to depolarization caused by pyrethroid actions on vgscs. data from the current study are
consistent with the latter possibility.
experiments to examine the routes of pyrethroid-induced
ca2⫹ entry using deltamethrin and tefluthrin as representative compounds demonstrated that extracellular ca2⫹,
rather than ca2⫹ release from the intracellular ca2⫹ stores,
served as the source for pyrethroid-induced elevation of
[ca2⫹]i in neocortical neurons. we also demonstrated that
l-type vgccs, nmda receptors, and the na⫹/ca2⫹ exchanger accounted for the majority of pyrethroid-induced
ca2⫹ entry. ttx completely abolished pyrethroid-induced
ca2⫹ entry, indicating that these pathways were activated as
a result of pyrethroid actions on vgscs. in the case of l-type
vgccs, activation by deltamethrin or tefluthrin is likely to
have been secondary to depolarization of the cell membrane
as a result of vgsc activation. although it was not measured, it is likely that the depolarization and ca2⫹ entry
resulted in glutamate release, which then activated nmda
receptors, resulting in additional ca2⫹ entry. finally, na⫹
entry through vgsc may have caused sodium loading of the
neurons, which can result in a reversal of na⫹/ca2⫹ exchange, which accounts for the contribution of this component to pyrethroid-induced ca2⫹ entry. the time-response
profile for pyrethroid-induced ca2⫹ influx occasionally appeared to be biphasic, and this may be caused by the distinct

pyrethroid-induced calcium influx

kinetics of the multiple calcium influx pathways. deltamethrin- or tefluthrin-stimulated ca2⫹ influx was similar to
that previously reported for brevetoxins in that it was triggered by activation of ttx-sensitive vgscs and the main
routes for ca2⫹ influx were through l-type ca2⫹ channels,
nmda receptors, and the reversed mode of operation of the
na⫹-ca2⫹ exchanger (berman and murray, 2000).
in summary, by monitoring [ca2⫹]i in intact neurons we
have compared the potencies and efficacies for an array of
pyrethroids to stimulate ca2⫹ influx. we demonstrated that,
in addition to modest differences in potency, pyrethroids
produced distinct maximum responses in the elevation of
neuronal [ca2⫹]i. this [ca2⫹]i response was secondary to the
effect of pyrethroids on vgscs. more importantly, these data
provide information regarding the mode of action of pyrethroids in intact mammalian neurons and indicate that the
effects on vgccs are secondary to the activation of vgscs.
