g- xxxd2177xxx  transaminase ( xxxg8xxx ,  xxxg8xxx )
is a  xxxd3047xxx  (plp) dependent enzyme that
catalyzes the degradation of g- xxxd2177xxx . the
kinetics of this reaction are studied in vitro, both in the
absence, and in the presence of two inhibitors: g-vinyl
gaba ( xxxd3508xxx ), and a natural product,
taurine (ethylamine-2-sulfonic acid). a kinetic model that
describes the transamination process is proposed.  xxxg8xxx 
from pseudomonas fluorescens is inhibited by g-vinyl
gaba and taurine at concentrations of 51.0 and 78.5 mm.
both inhibitors show competitive inhibition behavior
when gaba is the substrate and the inhibition constant
(ki) values for g-vinyl gaba and taurine were found to be
26 6 3 mm and 68 6 7 mm respectively. the transamination process of a-ketoglutarate was not affected by the
presence of g-vinyl gaba, whereas, taurine was a
noncompetitive inhibitor of  xxxg8xxx  when a-ketoglutarate was the substrate. the inhibition dissociation constant
(kii) for this system was found to be 96 6 10 mm: the
michaelis-menten constant (km) in the absence of
inhibition, was found to be 0:79 6 0:11 mm; and 0:47 6
0:10 mm for gaba and a-ketoglutarate respectively.

introduction
g- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) is a major inhibitory
neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous

system. it is the most prevalent and abundant
neurotransmitter in the brain with as many as
one-third of all neurons in the brain using gaba as
an inhibitory neurotransmitter.1
the adequate control of gaba levels in the brain is
attributed to the regulation of the levels of the anabolic
enzyme,  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase (gad; ec
4.1.1.15), and the catabolic enzyme, g-aminobutyric
acid transaminase ( xxxg8xxx ;  xxxg8xxx ).2 this can be
represented by the following equations:
gad

l –  xxxd2431xxx  ! gaba þ co2
gaba – t

gaba þ a 2 ketoglutarate ! succinic
semialdehyde þ glutamate

ð2þ

it is well known that reaction (2) undergoes schiff
base formation at the active site of  xxxg8xxx  that uses
pyridoxal-5-phosphate (plp) as a co-enzyme.3
in disorders such as epilepsy, huntington’s
chorea, and schizophernia, gaba levels are detected
to be lower than normal. here, inhibition of  xxxg8xxx 
becomes necessary to increase the levels of gaba
and to bring them back to normal.4
inhibition of  xxxg8xxx  can be accomplished by a
number of different inhibitors that vary in their
inhibitory effect towards  xxxg8xxx . examples of
structural analogue inhibitors include amino oxoacetic acid ( xxxd439xxx ),5 sodium-n- xxxd3485xxx 
( xxxd3485xxx ),3 and g-vinyl gaba. in fact, over the last
three decades, there have been several studies
suggesting g-vinyl gaba, known as vigabatrin, as
a potent inhibitor of  xxxg8xxx  in vivo and in vitro.6,7,4,8

taurine, on the other hand, is a natural product
found in the central nervous system, skeletal muscles,
and is very concentrated in the heart and brain.9
taurine is a sulfur containing amino acid which is
available in the diet but can be synthesized in the body
from cysteine. it is also obtained as a cleavage product
of taurcholic acid (the sodium salt of this acid occurs in
the bile). nevertheless, the functional role of taurine in
the body remains unknown. there are reports that
describe taurine as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in
the brain.10,11 other workers prefer to consider taurine
as modulator rather than a neurotransmitter.12,13 there
have been reports on the benefits of taurine supplementation for epileptics, membrane stabilization for
the muscles and nerves, and in the prevention of heart
failure. in this work, we study the kinetics of inhibition
of  xxxg8xxx  using two inhibitors, g-vinyl gaba and
taurine, in an attempt to comparatively assess their
inhibitory effect towards this enzymatic system.

methodology
materials and methods
enzymes, substrates, and co-factors. gabase from
pseudomonas fluorescens was purchased from sigmaaldrich chemical co (germany). the cell free
preparation contains both g- xxxd2177xxx  transaminase ( xxxg8xxx ) and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase  xxxg138xxx  ( xxxg138xxx ) with 44% protein
( xxxd2444xxx ) and total activity of 0.995 units/mg protein.
one unit of gabase converts one mmole of
g- xxxd2177xxx  to succinic semialdehyde and
then to succinate per minute with a stoichiometric
reduction of one mmole of nadpþ at ph 8.6 and 258c.
the chemicals gaba, sodium salt of a-ketoglutarate,
nadpþ, potassium pyrophosphate, potassium phosphate, and  xxxd26xxx  were reagent grade
from sigma-aldrich chemical co. g-vinyl gaba
(vigabatrin) was purchased from marion merrell
dow co, and mega taurine was purchased from twin
laboratories inc. (newyork, u.s.a).
initial velocity measurements
 xxxg8xxx  activity was measured by a coupled
spectrophotometric assay using a diode array
spectrophotometer hp 8453. in this procedure
gaba is converted into succinic semialdehyde by
 xxxg8xxx  and then to succinate by succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase ( xxxg138xxx ) with a stoichiometric reduction of nadpþ to nadph according to
the following equation.

the redox reaction was followed spectrophotometrically by recording the rate of increase in absorption
at 340 nm at a temperature of 258c. reaction mixtures
were made up to 3.00-ml containing potassium
pyrophosphate (0.1 m) ph 8.6, gaba (0.2–7.0 mm),
a-ketoglutarate (0.09–5.0 mm), nadpþ (1.66 mm),
and inhibitor (51.0 and 78.5 mm) for the kinetic studies
in presence of inhibitor. the reaction was initiated by
adding 0.02 ml of the standardized enzyme solution.
initial velocities were based upon the early linear
portions of the reaction curve. the kinetic studies were
performed by following the time course for  xxxg8xxx 
catalyzed transamination of gaba at different concentrations of a-ketoglutarate (4.0, 6.8 and 10.0 mm) at
a ph of 8.6 and a fixed temperature of 258c. initial
velocities were obtained on the basis of the initial linear
portion of the time courses for the reactions.
data analysis
kinetic parameters were obtained by nonlinear
regression analysis using the programs ez-fite
curve fitter14 and enzfitter [biosoft]. the substrate
saturation curves of a ping-pong mechanism were
fitted to equation (4). data conforming to competitive and non-competitive inhibition were fitted to
equations (5) and (6) respectively.

where n is the initial velocity, vmax is the maximum

values for the substrates a and b respectively; ki and
kii are the inhibition dissociation constants for the
inhibitor (i). ez-fit uses two nonlinear methods,
gauss –newton method, and the simplex method of
nelder and mead.15 in all cases the best model
selected is always the simplest one that passes all
statistical tests; the one that has the lowest x2 and
best correlation coefficient.

two structural analogues of the substrate were
tested for their ability to inhibit  xxxg8xxx : g-vinyl
gaba and taurine (scheme 1). g-vinyl gaba is a
drug used by patients suffering from epilepsy and
schizophrenia whereas the latter is a natural product
that has proved useful to those patients. few studies
have been performed on the kinetics and the
mechanism of action of taurine.
the steady state assays in the presence of g-vinyl
gaba demonstrated competitive inhibition with
respect to gaba as shown in figure 2. the inhibition
dissociation constant, ki, for this inhibitor was found
by fitting the data to equation (5) where a value of
26 ^ 3 mm was obtained. competitive inhibition
behaviour indicates the affinity of the inhibitor for
the substrate-binding site. the different degree of

inhibition can be explained by the similarities
between the substrate and its analogues.
interestingly, when a-ketoglutarate is varied at
fixed concentrations of gaba, g-vinyl gaba had no
effect on the initial rates. this result indicates clearly
that g-vinyl gaba has no inhibitory effect on the
amino-form of the enzyme. this agrees with
published information such as the studies on
incubation of rat brain  xxxg8xxx  with g-vinyl gaba
that was found to decrease the enzymatic activity.17
other studies showed that inhibition in vivo follows
pseudo first order kinetics and was described as
being in accord with a ping-pong bi bi mechanism.
the reciprocal plots of varied gaba concentration
(a-ketoglutarate concentration is fixed at 6.8 mm) in
the presence of different taurine concentrations
demonstrated a similar effect on  xxxg8xxx  to that of
g-vinyl gaba (figure 3). the patterns in figure 3
provide clear evidence of a competitive inhibition.
however in this case taurine is a weaker inhibitor
with respect to gaba with a ki value of 68 ^ 7 mm
compared to a ki of 26 ^ 3 mm for g-vinyl gaba.
competitive inhibition indicates that taurine and
g-vinyl gaba can bind to the same form of the
enzyme, which is the aldehyde form. by comparison
g-vinyl gaba and taurine are similar to gaba with
respect to the amino part of the molecule, and
therefore expected to bind in a similar fashion to the
same enzyme site. however, it is clear that
the presence of the zso2
3 group in taurine in place
of the zch2zcooh group resulted in the poorer
binding of taurine. this could be due to the fact that
the structural differences result in more stable
intermediates or the enzyme achieves a high degree

of specificity that favours certain configurations of
the substrates. the mechanism by which g-vinyl
gaba and taurine inhibit  xxxg8xxx  could be similar
to the well-known mechanism for the inhibition of
 xxxg8xxx  by g-ethynyl-gaba.18 in this mechanism
an aldimine intermediate is formed between the
inhibitor and the pyridoxal-50 -phosphate that might
be stabilized internally by hydrogen bonding. loss
of an a-hydrogen produces a resonance-stabilized
species by electron pair delocalization. this species is
expected to be more stable for g-vinyl-gaba than
for taurine. this is then followed by the tautomerization of the imine to form another intermediate which
upon attack of an enzyme active-site nucleophile
would give a covalently inactive enzyme. another
possible mechanism involves formation of an imine
between the coenzyme and the inhibitor followed by
a step in which the enzyme catalyzes the isomerization of the intermediate into a reactive conjugate
olefin.19 nucleophilic addition by an active site
nucleophile would result in the formation of a
covalently modified enzyme.
taurine was also found to inhibit  xxxg8xxx  in its
amino form when gaba concentration was fixed
and a-ketoglutarate concentration was varied.
figure 4 represents a double reciprocal plot of the
initial velocity vs. a-ketoglutarate concentration and
shows that taurine demonstrates a non-competitive
pattern of inhibition with respect to the amino form
of the enzyme. the value of the inhibition
dissociation constant kii for taurine is 96 ^ 10 mm
and is obtained by fitting the initial velocity data to
equation (6). in this type of inhibition a decrease in
the amount of the active enzyme would probably

result from the formation of an enzyme-substrateinhibitor complex. this reaction decreases the
proportion of the central complexes that proceed to
products, and as a result non-competitive inhibition
is observed.
in this study the slight upward curvature in the
double reciprocal plots of the initial velocity of
gaba (figure 1) is a clear indication of substrate
inhibition. furthermore when the data in figure 1
were subjected to a fit involving substrate inhibition,
slight improvement in the results was obtained but
without a significant change in the values of the
michaelis-menten constants. similar findings were
reported in the literature, as substrate inhibition is
very common in ping-pong mechanisms.3,13 usually
substrate inhibitions may result from the interaction
of the substrate with improper forms of the enzyme
that would form dead-end complexes. in general
dead-end complexes may result from two substrates
competing for a single enzyme-binding site that
exists in two forms, or one substrate binding at two
sites in a two-site enzyme.
it is worth mentioning here that the enzymatic
mechanism and the inhibition patterns of  xxxg8xxx 
from pseudomonas fluorescens and from mammalian
sources obey a ping-pong bi bi reaction mechanism. it is therefore imperative to indicate that
 xxxg8xxx  from a bacterial source is similar to a
certain extent to that from the mammalian source.
however, reported elsewhere, km values for
gaba and a-ketoglutarate were significantly
lower for the mammalian brain  xxxg8xxx  compared

301

to the bacterial enzyme. this may be due to
the existence of possible specific isozymes of
 xxxg8xxx .3,20
