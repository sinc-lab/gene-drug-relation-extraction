the selection of the most effective chemotherapy treatment based on evaluation of
biomarkers, that is, ‘tailor-made chemotherapy’, can improve the clinical outcome of nonsmall cell lung cancer patients, including early-stage tumors with a high metastatic
potential and advanced-stage tumors with a low proliferation rate. therefore, treatment
would be chosen according to which drugs would be most effective in combating specific
tumors. for example: 5-fluorouracil-derived agents would be used for tumors with a low
expression of  xxxg2366xxx ; gefitinib and  xxxd2029xxx  for tumors with epidermal growth
factor receptor (egfr) mutations or increased egfr gene copy numbers; cisplatin and
carboplatin for tumors with a low expression of excision repair cross complementing-1; and
gemcitabine for tumors with a low expression of ribonucleotide reductase. the remaining
populations of non-small cell lung cancers require chemotherapy using other drugs based
on an evaluation of other targeted molecules.

lung cancer is the most commonly occuring
cancer and the major cause of cancer-related
death [1]. non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc)
comprises approximately 75% of all lung cancers. most nsclc patients have locallyadvanced stage iii or metastatic stage iv disease
at diagnosis. in addition, even in the early stages,
some nsclc patients still have recurrence after
surgery. therefore, new therapeutic strategies are
required to improve the clinical outcome of
nsclc patients.
molecular biology studies have revealed many
molecules that affect the various biological behaviors of malignant tumors, including nsclcs. initially, the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes
or the activation of oncogenes may cause tumorigenesis [2,3]. during tumor progression, angiogenesis can affect tumor growth and metastasis [4].
furthermore, reduced expressions of metastatic
suppressor genes induce tumor cells with a high
metastatic potential [5,6]. therefore, it is important to design an optimal therapeutic strategy
according to the specific tumor biology [7].
the clinical use of these biomarkers can be
classified into three categories: the detection of
aggressive tumors with a poor prognosis among
early-stage tumors; the identification of less
aggressive tumors with a relatively good prognosis among advanced-stage tumors; and the selection of effective adjuvant therapies including
tailor-made chemotherapy.
biomarkers associated with tumor angiogenesis
or metastasis are effective at detecting aggressive
early-stage tumors [5,8]. therefore, postoperative

adjuvant chemotherapy might be necessary, even
in stage i nsclc when tumors are either
hypervascular or have a reduced expression of
metastatic suppressor genes.
in contrast, the tumor proliferation rate and
 xxxg2366xxx  (ts) expression levels are
useful markers for identifying less aggressive
tumors among locally-advanced nsclcs [8].
intratumoral ts expression is also a useful
marker to evaluate responsiveness to 5-fluorouracil (5-fu)-based chemotherapy. as a result,
careful evaluation of these markers, including the
tumor proliferation rate and target molecules for
chemotherapy, is expected to improve the clinical
outcome of patients with advanced nsclcs.
finally, the selection of an effective chemotherapy strategy based on an evaluation of
biomarkers, namely ‘tailor-made chemotherapy’, would be expected to improve the clinical
outcome of nsclc patients, including earlystage tumors with a high metastatic potential
and advanced-stage tumors with a low
proliferation rate.
biomarkers associated
with chemoresponsiveness

previous studies have demonstrated that several
biomarkers are associated with chemoresistance
in nsclc patients. the intratumoral apoptotic
index was reported to be associated with chemoresistance [9,10]. tumors with a low apoptotic
index may have low chemoresponsiveness and
thus be associated with a poor prognosis. in
addition, the tumor-suppressor p53 gene and
anti-apoptotic survivin expression are known to
future oncol. (2006) 2(2), 289–299

affect the apoptotic index and are also associated
with chemoresistance [10,11]. the expression of
multidrug resistance (mdr) and multidrug
resistance-associated proteins (mrps) also affect
chemoresistance [12–14]. furthermore, mutations
of the  xxxg1285xxx  oncogene were reported to induce
mdr expression in cell lines [15], and clinical
studies reported that the  xxxg1285xxx  mutations were
also associated with chemoresistance in nsclc
patients [16]. however, these biomarkers associated
with chemoresistance only indicate which types of
tumor are chemoresistant. as yet, no positive
information has been obtained from these studies.
in contrast, a recent high-throughput evaluation of biomarkers associated with a specific
tumor biology has improved the development of
molecular-targeted chemotherapies. to date, there
are many clinically available antitumor agents for
specific molecules. among these drugs, some
agents, such as 5-fu-derived agents and  xxxg681xxx  receptor (egfr) tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (tkis), have been widely used
for the treatment of nsclc patients. furthermore, more antitumor agents may be selected
based on an evaluation of targeted molecules.
therefore, in order to improve the clinical outcome of each nsclc patient, this review will aim
to discuss these antitumor agents. table 1 outlines
antitumor agents and their associated biomarkers.
5-fu-derived agents &
associated biomarkers

5-fu is one of the oldest and most commonly
prescribed antitumor drugs [17] and its pharmacological mechanisms are well understood.
5-fu is a prodrug, which needs to be activated
by phosphorylation, chiefly by using  xxxd2794xxx 
phosphoribosyltransferase ( xxxg2388xxx ) in tumor
cells [18]. next, 5-fu is converted into  xxxd2117xxx -5’-monophosphate, which forms
a tight-binding ternal complex with ts, resulting in the inhibition of ts activity [19]. therefore, ts is a target molecule of 5-fu. ts
catalyzes the conversion of deoxyuridine5´-monophosphate to  xxxd3364xxx -5´monophosphate, an essential step in dna synthesis. therefore, the activity of ts is necessary
for cell proliferation. in fact, intratumoral ts
expression is associated with tumor proliferation [8,20], responsiveness to 5-fu [21,22], and
the prognosis of cancer patients, including
nsclcs and gastrointestinal cancers [22–24].
furthermore,  xxxg652xxx  (dpd) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme
of 5-fu catabolism [25]. dpd is widely expressed
290

in most normal tissues, with its highest concentration being found in the liver and in peripheral
mononuclear cells (pmncs). a congenital deficiency of dpd can result in severe life-threatening toxicity when 5-fu is administered [26].
many studies have demonstrated the intratumoral dpd activity also affects resistance to
5-fu [22,27]. as a result, responsiveness to 5-fu
is affected by the intratumoral activity of ts,
 xxxg2388xxx  and dpd. therefore, several different
types of 5-fu have been developed to suppress
intratumoral dpd activity. uft (taiho pharmaceutical co., tokyo, japan) is a combination
of  xxxd3301xxx  and uracil. uracil is also a target of
dpd and it can diminish the catalytic activity of
dpd for 5-fu. randomized clinical studies
have found uft to be an effective postoperative
adjuvant chemotherapy for nsclcs [28,29].
the authors’ clinical study of nsclc
patients treated with 5-fu revealed that the
intratumoral expression of ts and dpd independently affects responsiveness to 5-fu [22].
survival rates were significantly lower in
patients with high-ts tumors than in those
with low-ts tumors. in addition, survival rates
were was also significantly lower in patients
with high-dpd tumors than in those with lowdpd tumors. overall, survival rates were highest amongst nsclc patients with low expression of ts and dpd, treated with 5-fu.
furthermore, intratumoral ts expression is a
useful marker for evaluating responsiveness to
5-fu, especially in those with stage ii–iii
nsclcs [8]. the same results have also been
reported in other studies [30–32].
however, the efficacy of uft is still lower in
nsclcs than in gastrointestinal cancers. the
frequency of low-ts and low-dpd tumors
(most responsive to treatment with 5-fu) was
30.8% amongst colon cancers. in contrast,
amongst nsclcs, the frequency of low-ts and
low-dpd tumors was only 7.6%, while the frequency of low-ts but high-dpd tumors was
62.4% [unpublished data]. thus, nsclcs may be
considered to be tumors with a high expression
of dpd, consequently it would be necessary to
inhibit dpd activity in order to improve the
tumor’s responsiveness to 5-fu. recently, s-1
(a combination of  xxxd3301xxx , gimeracil and oteracil potassium, taiho pharmaceutical co.) has
been developed for clinical use [33–35]. gimeracil
could be a strong inhibitor for the intratumoral
dpd activity. therefore, tumors with a low ts
expression might be successfully treated by s-1
without evaluating intratumoral dpd activity.

gefitinib &  xxxd2029xxx  against egfr

egfr is a member of the  xxxg682xxx  family of transmembrane  xxxg2198xxx  receptors, and its signal can induce tumor cell proliferation and
angiogenesis. egfr inhibitors can be categorized into two classes: small molecules that are
inhibitors of the intracellular  xxxg2198xxx 
domain of egfr, and monoclonal antibodies
to the extracellular domain of egfr [36]. gefitinib (iressa®; astrazeneca, de, usa) and  xxxd2029xxx  (tarceva®; osi pharmaceuticals, ny,
usa) are specific tkis of egfr. recent clinical studies have revealed genetic alterations of
egfr, such as mutations and increased gene
copy numbers, that are associated with the
responsiveness to these tkis.
egfr mutations frequently occur between
exon 18–21, thus corresponding to its tyrosine
kinase domain [37–39]. most egfr mutations
are deletions in exon 19 or point mutations of
codon 858 in exon 21. these egfr mutations
frequently occur in adenocarcinomas, nonsmoking, female, and east-asian patients
[39,40]. therefore, gefitinib is likely to be effective for nonsmoking patients with adenocarcinomas in japan [40]. many clinical studies have
shown egfr mutations to be associated with
responsiveness to gefitinib and  xxxd2029xxx  [39–43],
and an increased chance of survival for
nsclc patients treated with gefitinib
[40,41,43–45]. however, several prospective clinical studies did not show a survival benefit for
www.futuremedicine.com

nsclc patients with egfr mutations who
are treated with these tkis [42,46]. in addition,
other studies have reported that a second
mutation in the egfr kinase domain might be
associated with an acquired resistance to
gefitinib or  xxxd2029xxx  [47,48].
in contrast, recent clinical studies using fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) demonstrated that increased egfr gene copy numbers
are associated with both the responsiveness to
gefitinib and  xxxd2029xxx  tkis and a better survival rate for nsclc patients receiving these
tkis [42,43,45,46,49]. in addition, several clinical
studies using immunohistochemistry (ihc) also
demonstrated an overexpression of egfr proteins to be associated with responsiveness to
these tkis and a better survival of nsclc
patients receiving these tkis [42,46].
as a result, gefitinib and  xxxd2029xxx  could be
effective for nsclcs with egfr mutations or
increased egfr gene copy numbers. however,
the potential occurrence of interstitial lung disease should be kept in mind when using gefitinib. the incidence of interstitial lung disease in
patients treated with gefitinib was approximately
1% (2% in the japanese postmarketing experience and approximately 0.3% in a us expanded
access program), and approximately a third of
such cases were fatal [50]. as a result, careful
observations are necessary in gefitinib-treated
patients in order to detect the occurrence of
interstitial lung disease.

cetuximab against egfr

cetuximab (erbitux®,  xxxd467xxx ; imclone systems, ny, usa) is a chimeric human–mouse
monoclonal antibody that binds the extracellular domain of egfr to block ligand
binding [51]. an experimental study demonstrated that the combined treatment of cetuximab plus gefitinib or  xxxd2029xxx  augments the
potency of egfr signaling inhibition [52].
cetuximab has recently been registered for the
treatment of irinotecan-refractory colorectal
cancer patients [53]. in addition, a clinical study
in colorectal cancer patients has demonstrated
that increased egfr gene copy numbers are
associated with responsiveness to cetuximab
while egfr mutations are not [54]. to date,
only a few studies have been performed in
advanced nsclcs and the results are still preliminary [55]. in addition, egfr mutations are
not associated with sensitivity to cetuximab [56].
trastuzumab against her2

the her2/neu/erbb2 proto-oncogene encodes
another member of the  xxxg682xxx  family. her2 gene
amplification and its overexpression have been
reported to be associated with adverse tumor
characteristics and a poor prognosis in human
cancers [57–59]. trastuzumab (herceptin®;
genentech inc., ca. usa) is a humanized antiher2 monoclonal antibody [60]. trastuzumab
only demonstrates efficacy in her2-positive
tumors, that is, those with amplification/overexpression, and its clinical efficacy has been well
established in her2-positive metastatic breast
cancers [61,62]. however, the clinical benefit of
trastuzumab has not yet been observed in
nsclcs. these results might be partly because
the incidence of her2-positive nsclcs is
rather low. her2 overexpression, defined as 2+
or 3+ by ihc, ranges from 10–20% in
nsclcs (and up to 30% in adenocarcinomas)
[63]. however, the majority of such her2-positive nsclcs are ihc 2+, and her2 gene
amplification is uncommon among nsclcs.
only her2 3+ expression has been reported to
be associated with her2 gene amplification
[63]. in fact, several clinical studies have reported
that patients with nsclcs with her2 3+
expression may benefit from trastuzumab,
although this subgroup is too small to provide
definite information [64–66]. however, a recent
clinical study reported that patients with
increased her2 gene copy numbers represented
22.8% of nsclc patients [67]. in addition,
mutations of her2 were also reported in
292

nsclcs [68]. further clinical studies are
required to clarify whether trastuzumab is effective for tumors with these genetic alterations
of her2.
platinum-based chemotherapy & dna
repair genes

platinum-based chemotherapy, such as cisplatin
and carboplatin, is still the main form of combination chemotherapy used to treat nsclc
patients. many studies have demonstrated that
sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy is
affected by the dna repair pathway [69–71].
among these pathways, excision repair crosscomplementing (ercc)1 is a leading component of nucleotide excision repair (ner),
which participates in dna damage recognition
and dna strand incision. previous clinical
studies have demonstrated that a low  xxxg724xxx 
gene expression is associated with a superior
response to cisplatin and a greater survival rate
of cancer patients receiving combination
chemotherapy using cisplatin, including
nsclc patients [69–71]. these results also highlight the potential of tailor-made chemotherapy. to date, several prospective clinical studies
have been performed to clarify this possibility
in nsclc patients [72,73].
in addition, sequence variations have been
identified in a number of dna repair genes,
including  xxxg725xxx .  xxxg725xxx  is one of the seven genetic
complementation groups encoding for the proteins involved in the ner pathway.  xxxg725xxx  polymorphisms have a modulating effect on the
dna repair capacity [74], and as a result, several
types of  xxxg725xxx  polymorphisms can also cause
resistance to cisplatin [75].
gemcitabine against
ribonucleotide reductase

ribonucleotide reductase is required for cells to
maintain deoxynucleotide pools for dna replication and repair [76]. gemcitabine is converted
into difluorodeoxycystidine 5´-diphosphate
through phosphorylation, which interferes with
the function of ribonucleotide reductase. as a
result, ribonucleotide reductase is considered to
be a target molecule for gemcitabine. the ribonucleotide reductase subunit m1 ( xxxg1991xxx ) gene
encodes its large subunit. recent clinical studies
revealed that an overexpression of the  xxxg1991xxx 
gene is associated with resistance to gemcitabine
and a poor survival rate for nsclc patients
receiving gemcitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy
[77,78]. these findings indicated that a subset of
future oncol. (2006) 2(2)

tailor-made chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer patients – review

gemcitabine/cisplatin-treated patients with low
expression of  xxxg724xxx  and  xxxg1991xxx  may survive
for longer. prospective clinical studies have thus
been performed to clarify whether this is a
possible tailor-made chemotherapy strategy [72].
taxanes against tubulin

taxanes, such as paclitaxel (taxol®; bristol
myers squibb company, nj, usa), are antimicrotubule agents. microtubules serve as
‘rails’ for the movement of intracellular vesicles
and organelles, such as chromosomes, and are
involved in the segregation and movement of
chromosomes during mitosis. the subunit of a
microtubule is a dimer of two related polypeptides, alpha-tubulin and  xxxg2353xxx . experimental studies have revealed that mutations in the
paclitaxel-binding region of the  xxxg2353xxx  gene
are associated with paclitaxel resistance [79], and
that the mutations of the  xxxg2353xxx  gene in
paclitaxel-resistant cell lines cluster at the site
involved in the microtubule assembly [80]. a
clinical study in nsclc also reported mutations in the  xxxg2353xxx  gene to be associated
with paclitaxel resistance [81]. however, other
studies reported that such mutations of  xxxg2353xxx  gene are rare in nsclcs [82,83]. however, a
few clinical studies revealed an overexpression
of  xxxg2353xxx  to also be associated with paclitaxel
resistance in various cancers, including
nsclcs [77,84].
bevacizumab against  xxxg2413xxx 

angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth and
metastasis [4]. angiogenesis is governed by a host
of pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors.
among these,  xxxg2413xxx 
(vegf)-a, a member of the vegf family, is
the most potent pro-angiogenic factor.  xxxg2413xxx 
expression is upregulated in most human cancers. in fact, intratumoral  xxxg2413xxx  expression
affects tumor angiogenesis [85], and it is associated with tumor growth, nodal metastases and a
poor prognosis in nsclc patients [8]. furthermore, stromal  xxxg2413xxx  expression also affects
tumor proliferation through the tumor–stromal
interaction [86].
bevacizumab (avastin®; genentech inc., ca,
usa) is a recombinant humanized version of
the murine antihuman  xxxg2413xxx  monoclonal
antibody. bevacizumab is generally well tolerated and does not increase the incidence of toxicity caused by chemotherapy, as occurs with
the combination of carboplatin plus paclitaxel
[87]. thus, bevacizumab is used clinically in
www.futuremedicine.com

combination with chemotherapy. randomized
clinical studies demonstrated a survival benefit
when bevacizumab is combined with standard
chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer [88,89]. a recent randomized trial in nsclc patients also revealed
that bevacizumab in combination with carboplatin plus paclitaxel improved the clinical outcome of patients with advanced or recurrent
nsclcs [90]. considering its molecular biology, bevacizumab might be more effective for
 xxxg2413xxx -overexpressing tumors. therefore,
further clinical studies with an evaluation of the
 xxxg2413xxx  expression are required to identify the
subgroup of bevacizumab-responsive tumors.
 xxxd2333xxx  against c-kit

 xxxd2333xxx  (gleevec®; novartis ag,
zurich, switzerland) is an orally bioavailable,
small molecule that selectively inhibits several
tyrosine kinases, including c-kit and bcrabl [91]. most small cell lung carcinomas
(sclcs), both cell lines and tumor specimens,
have a positive expression of c-kit and stem cell
factor (scf). this suggests the possibility that
the c-kit/scf autocrine pathway is involved in
the pathogenesis of sclc. previous studies
have reported that  xxxd2333xxx  inhibits
the growth of sclc cell lines [92,93]. however,
phase ii clinical studies in sclc patients
revealed that  xxxd2333xxx  did not have
any antitumor activity against sclcs [94–96].
however, a recent study revealed that 64% of
adenocarcinomas also had a positive expression
of c-kit [97]. further studies are necessary to
evaluate the responsiveness to  xxxd2333xxx 
against c-kit-expressing adenocarcinomas.
topoisomerase inhibitors against
topoisomerase i & ii

topoisomerase (topo) i and ii are the essential
enzymes of dna replication and chromosome
segregation [98]. their inhibitors, including
 xxxd3401xxx  and irinotecan as topo i inhibitors
and etoposide as a  xxxg2312xxx  inhibitor, are also
agents with considerable activity in cancer
patients. etoposide acts as a  xxxg2312xxx  poison by
stabilizing the enzyme–dna cleavable complex [99]. this stabilization initiates a biochemical cascade, leading to cell death. as a result,
low cellular levels of  xxxg2312xxx  expression lead to
a reduced formation of the etoposide-stabilized  xxxg2312xxx –dna cleavable complex, resulting in resistance to etoposide [100,101]. in
contrast, the transduction of the  xxxg2312xxx  gene
293

review – huang, yokomise, fukushima & kinoshita

increased the sensitivity of etoposide-resistant
cancer cells to etoposide [102]. as a result, etoposide could be effective for nsclcs with a high
expression of  xxxg2312xxx . however,  xxxg2312xxx 

expression is relatively low in nsclcs compared with sclcs [103]. furthermore, topo i
inhibitors increase the  xxxg2312xxx  levels and
increase the cell toxicity induced by  xxxg2312xxx

tailor-made chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer patients – review

poisons [104,105]. the sequential administration
of topo i inhibitors and etoposide has been
evaluated in phase ii clinical studies in sclc
patients [106,107]. however, such randomized
studies in ncslcs are still few in number [108].
conclusions

tailor-made chemotherapy can improve the
clinical outcome of nsclc patients, including
early-stage tumors with a high metastatic potential and advanced-stage tumors with a low proliferation rate [8]. taking into consideration the
results from previous clinical studies in nsclc
patients, the following drugs could be effective
for specific tumor types: 5-fu derived agents for
tumors with a low expression of ts; gefitinib
and  xxxd2029xxx  for tumors with egfr mutations
or increased egfr gene copy numbers; cisplatin
and carboplatin for tumors with a low expression of  xxxg724xxx ; and gemcitabine for tumors
with a low expression of  xxxg1991xxx . at present, we
are utilizing tailor-made chemotherapy based on
co-evaluation of ts expression and egfr gene
status for nsclc patients. however, most
tumors with a low expression of ts or egfr
mutations are adenocarcinomas. the remaining
populations of nsclcs require chemotherapy
using other drugs based on an evaluation of
other targeted molecules.

future perspective

many clinical studies have demonstrated intratumoral  xxxg2413xxx  expression to be higher in adenocarcinomas. in contrast, the authors recently
found stromal  xxxg2413xxx  expression to be higher
in squamous cell carcinomas [86]. as a result, bevacizumab might be effective for tumors with
positive  xxxg2413xxx  expression, including intratumoral and stromal expression. further prospective, randomized clinical studies are needed to
clarify this possibility. in addition, combined
therapies could be more effective than monotherapies. bevacizumab plus  xxxd2029xxx  therapy
might be effective for tumors with  xxxg2413xxx -positive and egfr mutations [109]. as mentioned
above, the key for selecting of tailor-made
chemotherapy is the frequency of the abnormality of biomarkers in nsclcs and the efficacy of
associated antitumor agents, respectively. recent
pharmacogenomic strategies and the use of highdensity genomic microarrays will help in the
development of more molecular-targeted agents.
furthermore, a new strategy based on molecular
biology could be developed in the near future.
some gene delivery therapies might also induce
some additional effect on conventional chemotherapy. for example, the suppression of ts
expression by rna interference might induce
the responsiveness to 5-fu.
