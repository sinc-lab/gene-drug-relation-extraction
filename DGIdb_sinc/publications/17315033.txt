thyroid hormones ( xxxd1863xxx  [t4], and 3,5,3'triiodothyronine [t3]) have major effects on
developmental and physiological processes and
act on most tissues; the central nervous system is
a most important target. during brain maturation, thyroid hormones influence a wide range
of developmental processes, such as myelination
and neuronal and glial cell differentiation and
migration; genes involved in these processes
have been identified as being regulated by
thyroid hormones.1 an altered supply of thyroid
hormones in developing humans can cause irreversible mental retardation and neurological
deficits. in adults, thyroid hormones influence
mood and behavior, and thyroid diseases can
lead to psychiatric manifestations.2,3
the main cellular site of thyroid hormones
action is the nucleus, where chromatinassociated thyroid hormone receptors (trs) are
present. 4 the trs are transcription factors with
ligand-modulated activity. trs influence gene
expression by interacting with regulatory sites in
target genes, in a similar way to other members
of the nuclear receptor superfamily5–7 (box 1
and figure 1). in brief, trs and other class ii
nuclear receptors, such as  xxxd3417xxx  receptors, bind to dna in the absence or presence of
the hormone. the dna-bound, ligand-free tr,
or aporeceptor, interacts with corepressors and
inhibits target gene transcription. hormone
binding induces a conformational change of
the receptor that facilitates corepressor dissociation, binding of coactivators, and stimulation
of transcription.
other models of thyroid hormone action have
been proposed. in one of these paradigms, t4
and t3 bind to a membrane receptor formed
by the  xxxg1207xxx , which then transduces
the hormonal signal to the mitogen-activated
protein kinase (mapk) signaling cascade.8 this
activation results in phosphorylation of nuclear
targets, such as the tr and other transcription
factors. in this way, thyroid hormones, acting
at the cell membrane, can influence the activity

thyroid hormones are important during development of the
mammalian brain, acting on migration and differentiation of neural
cells, synaptogenesis, and myelination. the actions of thyroid hormones
are mediated through nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (trs) and
regulation of gene expression. the purpose of this article is to review the
role of trs in brain maturation. in developing humans maternal and
fetal thyroid glands provide thyroid hormones to the fetal brain, but the
timing of receptor ontogeny agrees with clinical data on the importance
of the maternal thyroid gland before midgestation. several tr isoforms,
which are encoded by the  xxxg2283xxx  and  xxxg2284xxx  genes, are expressed in the
brain, with the most common being tralpha1. deletion of tralpha1 in rodents
is not, however, equivalent to hormone deprivation and, paradoxically,
even prevents the effects of hypothyroidism. unliganded receptor activity
is, therefore, probably an important factor in causing the harmful effects
of hypothyroidism. accordingly, expression of a mutant receptor with
impaired triiodothyronine (t3) binding and dominant negative activity
affected cerebellar development and motor performance. trs are also
involved in adult brain function. tralpha1 deletion, or expression of a
dominant negative mutant receptor, induces consistent behavioral changes
in adult mice, leading to severe anxiety and morphological changes in
the hippocampus.

box 1 regulation of transcription by thyroid
hormone receptors.
the genomic actions of thyroid hormone are
exerted by binding of t3 to nuclear thyroid
receptors.4 nuclear receptors either repress or
activate gene expression and are central regulators
of developmental and metabolic processes by
coordinating large gene-expression networks.
nuclear receptors bind to specific dna
sequences in the regulatory regions of their target
genes known as response elements (see figure 1).
some receptors, such as thyroid receptors, bind to
dna in the absence or presence of the hormone.
in the simplest model, the ligand-free receptor,
or aporeceptor, represses gene transcription
by recruiting other regulatory proteins called
corepressors to form the core of a large corepressor
complex containing proteins with histone
deacetylase activity.70 deacetylated histones
keep the chromatin in a compact conformation
with repression of transcription. hormone binding
induces a conformational change of the receptor
with release of corepressors and recruitment
of coactivators.5 histone acetylation modifies
chromatin structure and facilitates the recruitment
of the basal transcription machinery to the gene
promoters. additionally, the thyroid receptorassociated protein– xxxg2412xxx -interacting
protein complex can bridge the liganded receptor
with the basal transcription machinery and facilitate
the interaction between rna polymerase ii and
basal transcription factors.
the current concept7 is that coactivators
and corepressors are part of large multisubunit
complexes that contain other enzymatic activities,
in addition to acetyl transferases and deacetylases
such as methylases, kinases, phosphatases,
atp-dependent chromatin-remodeling enzymes,
and others. the individual components of these
complexes interact in a combinatorial way with
the receptors, and their activity can also be
modified by covalent modifications from cellular
signaling cascades. all this provides a high degree
of flexibility and specificity for the tight control of
developmental and physiologic process.

of iodothyronines with the production of
3-iodothyronamine.11 this metabolite binds
to the g-protein-coupled membrane receptor
taar1 ( xxxg2239xxx ;
previously called  xxxg2239xxx ) and induces fast
responses. the contributions of these alternative
pathways to the overall physiological effects of
thyroid hormones are unknown, but it is generally believed that the nuclear pathway is the
main contributor to thyroid hormone action.
an important feature of thyroid hormone
action in the brain is how the concentrations of
the transcriptionally active hormone (t3) are
regulated. in addition to thyroidal secretion, a
large fraction of brain t3 is generated locally from
t4 by type 2 deiodinase (d2).12 this enzyme is
expressed in glial cells of two types: astrocytes
and tanycytes13,14 (the latter are specialized glial
cells lining the walls of the third ventricle). t4
and t3 can be metabolized to reverse t3 and to
t2, respectively, by type 3 deiodinase (d3), which
is expressed in neurons.15
conversion of t4 to t3 in the glial cells might be
important in the transfer of t3 to the cellular targets
of action, facilitating local control of t3 supply to
nearby neurons. in this respect, data have demonstrated that thyroid hormone uptake in the brain
is facilitated by specific transporters. mutations
of one of these transporters—monocarboxylate
transporter 8 ( xxxg2091xxx )—cause severe developmental delays and neurological deficits in humans.
to what extent deficient transfer of t3 from glial
cells to neurons plays a part in this syndrome is a
matter of debate.13,14,16,17
here i discuss the role of trs in the human
brain and in rodent models. first i examine the
role of thyroid hormone and its receptors in brain
development. then i detail available findings
from mouse models of receptor deletion or mutations and formulate some hypotheses concerning
the role of receptors during development and
in adults.

brain after approximately 8−10 weeks of gestation18 (figure 2a). in subsequent weeks, the
receptor concentration greatly increases in
brain and other tissues, supporting the view
of an important role of thyroid hormones on
developmental processes taking place during the
second trimester.
for decades severe hormone deprivation early
in pregnancy has been recognized to result in
irreversible neurological impairment with spastic
diplegia, extrapyramidal rigidity, deaf-mutism,
dysarthria, and mental deficiency, as occurs in
neurological cretinism (figure 2b).23,24 the clinical manifestations suggest that damage of the
cerebral cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cochlea
occur during the second trimester of gestation
(figure 2c).24 on the other hand, congenital
hypothyroidism (figure 2b), if diagnosed and
treated early after birth, does not usually result in
deafness or neurological signs because maternal
hormones protect the brain from damage
during gestation (figure 2a). a severe syndrome
is, however, observed in cases of combined
maternal and fetal hypothyroidism25 and is not
preventable with postnatal treatment.
during the first half of human pregnancy,
the contribution of thyroid hormones from the
mother is very important for development of
the fetal brain before the fetal thyroid gland is fully
active. despite low circulating fetal concentrations
of t4 and t3, brain t3 levels greatly increase in the
cerebral cortex during the second trimester. this
increase takes place in parallel with increasing
activity of  xxxd226xxx  (figure 2a). expression of d2
seems to be one important regulatory factor
during the early action of t3 in brain, by locally
generating the tr ligand from the t4 substrate.
although the relative contributions of mother
and fetus to brain t4 levels before term are not
known, the mother probably provides a significant proportion of the fetal t4 pool during the
first half of pregnancy. the thinking that maternal
t4 is important for fetal brain development has
received experimental support in rats.
in rat models, the critical period of thyroid
hormone action in brain is thought to extend
from around gestational day 18 to postnatal
days 21–25 (p21–p25).27 most morphological
alterations associated with hypothyroidism
are observed in the postnatal period.28 this
effect is more obvious in brain regions that
mature after birth, such as the cerebellum.29 in
this organ, neonatal hypothyroidism induces
delay in granular cell migration and an arrested

purkinje cell differentiation. consequently,
persistence of the external germinal layer and
poorly developed dendritic trees of purkinje
cells are very characteristic landmarks of
neonatal hypothyroidism in rodents. during
this period, most genes that are known to be
regulated in vivo by thyroid hormones are sensitive to the thyroid status not only in the cerebellum but also in other brain regions.1,30,31
these observations would imply that, in the rat,
thyroid hormone action on brain development
occurs mainly after birth.
the receptor is, however, present in the
rat brain much earlier. t3-binding-receptor
activity in the whole brain can be detected at
embryonic day 14 (e14),32 and messenger
rna for the receptor is present by e11.5 in
the neural tube and by e12.5 in certain areas of
the diencephalon and ventral rhombencephalon.33
restricted groups of cells could, therefore, be
targets of thyroid hormones during these early
stages of development.
influences of maternal t3 and t4
on fetal brain maturation

not only receptor ontogeny but also additional
experimental evidence indicates that the fetal
rat brain could be a target of thyroid hormones.
the newborn rat is developmentally equivalent
to the human fetus between the fourth and fifth
gestational months, and the newborn human
is equivalent to the rat around p10.28,34 the
thyroid gland develops in the human fetus
during the second trimester, whereas in the
rat, fetal thyroid function starts on e17.5–18.0.
before that time, the only possible source of
thyroid hormone for the fetus is the maternal
thyroid. the relative contribution of the fetal
thyroid gland increases progressively with
gestation, but even at term the contribution of
maternal t4 to newborn blood t4 is 17–18% in
the rat.35 for comparison, this figure amounts
to 30–50% in the human.36
thyroid hormones of maternal origin can
already be detected in the rat embryo 3 days
after uterine implantation, and in the human
fetus it can be detected in the coelomic fluid.37
during these early stages, high expression of d3
in the uterine implantation site probably limits
the amounts of thyroid hormone that reach
embryonic tissues.38 a clear role of maternal
thyroid hormones on neuronal migration
in the cerebral cortex later in development
has been demonstrated. 39 pregnant rats

in addition to the structural defects, the
progeny of hypothyroxinemic rats were functionally impaired; for example, they were more
prone to audiogenic seizures.40 these results
demonstrate the importance of maternal t4 in
rat fetal brain development. in the human fetus,
the equivalent time for neocortical neuronal
migration extends from around the end of the
first trimester to midgestation.

less recognized are the consequences of hypothyroxinemia. in a geographical area of moderate
iodine deficiency, vermiglio et al.21 found that
attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder
(adhd) is more prevalent in children born
from mothers who become hypothyroxinemic in
early pregnancy than in children from mothers
who were hypothyroxinemic after the 20th week
of gestation. in their thorough discussions on
this subject, morreale de escobar et al.19,42
advocated the need to monitor free t4 levels as
early as possible in pregnancy.
tr genes and functional specificity
of receptor isoforms

the four tr subtypes (tralpha1, trbeta1, trbeta2,
and trbeta3), which bind both t3 and dna, are
encoded by two different genes— xxxg2283xxx  and
 xxxg2284xxx . several isoforms are generated by alternative rna splicing and differential promoter
use.4,43,44 tralpha1 is generated from  xxxg2283xxx ; the
tralpha2 variant, also known as c-erbaalpha2, is a
nonreceptor protein generated by alternative
splicing that conserves the dna-binding
domain and differs in the carboxyl terminus
so that it does not bind t3.  xxxg2284xxx  encodes the
receptor proteins trbeta1, trbeta2, and, at least in
the rat, trbeta3; the gene also encodes a truncated
protein (∆trbeta3), which binds t3 but not dna.
the physiological functions of the nonreceptor
proteins are not clear.
 xxxg2283xxx  and  xxxg2284xxx  are expressed in the brain,
with partly unique and partly overlapping
patterns. to quantify the relative proportion
of individual receptor isoforms at the protein
level, ercan-fang and co-workers45 performed
quantitative immunoprecipitation of labeled
t3–receptor complexes with antibodies specific
for tr isoforms. they reached the conclusion that
tralpha1 accounts for 70–80% of all receptors present
in adult rat cerebrum and cerebellum. most

254 nature clinical practice endocrinology & metabolism

effects of thyroid hormone in brain are, therefore, likely to be mediated through this receptor
subtype. no similar estimations are available for
the developing brain, but based on the messenger
rna content, it may be assumed that tralpha1 is also
the predominant receptor, especially during the
fetal period, in humans and rodents.
t3 is the only physiological, high-affinity ligand
for nuclear trs, but high-affinity, isoform-selective
tr analogs have been synthesized.46 they allow
the possibility of defining specific functions of
tralpha or trbeta variants by using specific ligands.47
for example, by use of the trbeta-specific ligand
 xxxg2124xxx —that is, 3,5-dimethyl-4-[4-hydroxy3-isopropylbenzyl]phenyloxyl acetate—my
group has shown that the effects of t3 on cerebellar granule cell migration and gene expression are mediated by tralpha1, whereas the effects
on purkinje cell differentiation are mediated by
both tralpha1 and trbeta isoforms.48
this functional selectivity might be due
either to differential expression or to specific
interaction of tr isoforms with effectors. in
the cerebellum, the different roles of receptor
subtypes are probably due to differing expression patterns, because tralpha1 is predominantly
expressed in the granular cell layer, whereas
purkinje cells predominantly express trbeta1.
although this difference might also cause most
other cases of isoform-specific responses, there
are some particular indications for different
interactions of tralpha and trbeta isoforms with
target genes. for example, nrgn (the human
equivalent of rat nrgn) and rasd2 (previously termed ras homolog enriched in striatum
[rhes]) genes, which are expressed in the same
cells in the striatum, respond differently to the
administration of t3 or  xxxg2124xxx , suggesting that
nrgn, in contrast to rasd2, is responsive only
through tralpha1.49
receptor deletion might not
equate to hormone deficiency

another approach to dissect the differential role
of receptor subtypes is the use of mutant mice
with receptor gene knockouts. it was previously
assumed that receptor deletion should lead to
similar consequences as removal of the hormone.
indeed, the effects of thyroid-hormone deprivation overlap with  xxxg2284xxx  deletion in many
discrete instances, such as in the cochlea43 or
retina.50 in general, however, the phenotype of
t3 receptor knockout mice, even if all receptor
genes are deleted, is much milder than the

review
www.nature.com/clinicalpractice/endmet

phenotype of profound hypothyroid mice.51
several lines of evidence support the view that
in hypothyroid animals the presence of receptor
in the unliganded form (aporeceptor) leads to a
phenotype that might not be equivalent to that
in the absence of receptor.52–54
for example, in my group’s studies,48 we
analyzed the consequences of tralpha1 deletion on
cerebellar development. as mentioned earlier, we
showed that granular cell migration during the
postnatal period is under the control of tralpha1.
accordingly, it was expected that the absence of
tralpha1 would have interfered with granular cell
migration. we were, therefore, very surprised
that we saw no difference in the migration of
granular cells when comparing normal mice to
tralpha1 knockout mice. even more paradoxical
was the result obtained when antithyroid
drugs were administered to the mice to induce
hypothyroidism. in wild-type animals, hypothyroidism was indeed associated with altered
cerebellar structure; however, the same treatment
had no effect on the mice deficient for tralpha1.
these observations demonstrated that migration of cerebellar granule cells can take place
normally in the absence of both the receptor
and the hormone. migration of granular cells
takes place according to an internal program,
and it is uncertain whether thyroid hormones
are needed for deployment of the program.55
the failure of hypothyroidism to affect this
process in mice devoid of receptors suggests
that the hormones are permissive in vivo when
the receptor is present; thus, the receptor might
act as a ‘brake’ that the ligand inactivates, but if
the receptor is absent, there is no ‘brake’ present
(see figure 1a–c). the cell migration defect
observed in wild-type hypothyroid animals is
a consequence of unliganded receptor activity.
the findings by flamant et al.54 on mice with
knockouts for both pax8 (paired box gene 8) and
 xxxg2283xxx  genes support this conclusion. the pax8
transcription factor is essential for thyroid gland
morphogenesis, and accordingly, pax8 knockout
(pax8–/–) mice are severely hypothyroid. the
pups do not survive postnatally unless treated
with thyroid hormone. the effect of pax8 deletion can, however, be rescued by deletion of the
whole  xxxg2283xxx  gene, but not the  xxxg2284xxx  gene, indicating that the unliganded tralpha1 was probably
responsible for the lack of survival of profoundly
hypothyroid, pax8–/– mice; however, selective
deletion of tralpha1, in contrast to the whole  xxxg2283xxx 
gene, did not increase the survival of pax8–/–

mice, suggesting a more complex scenario,
perhaps involving the tralpha2 variant.56
our observations on cerebellar development
in tralpha1 knockout mice imply that it may not
be possible to deduce physiological actions
of thyroid hormone from the phenotype of
profoundly hypothyroid animals. the presence of unliganded receptors might interfere
with developmental programs or physiological
processes that under normal conditions might
require thyroid hormones only as permissive
factors. for example, we noted an effect of tr on
neuronal differentiation.57 pheochromocytoma
pc12 cells differentiate into neurons after
exposure to  xxxg1564xxx , and t3 has
no effect in this process; however, exogenous
tralpha1 expression blocks  xxxg1564xxx 
induced differentiation, unless t3 is added. in
this cellular system, tr expression makes the
cells dependent on t3 for differentiation.57
because the aporeceptor has transcriptional
activity, it might have unrecognized physiological roles during early developmental stages
in cells where the receptor is expressed but
hormone availability is limited.58 for example,
the aporeceptor could keep gene expression
repressed until t3 becomes available to the cell.
in the pc12 paradigm referred to above, the
timing of differentiation of neuronal precursors
expressing the tr would be dependent upon
t3 availability.
the extent to which this process occurs is so
far a matter of speculation. in the heart, tralpha1
functions at the time of birth as a molecular
switch, maintaining gene expression repressed
until activation by the ligand.59 in the embryonic
brain, local expression of d2 and d3 and thyroid
hormone transporters and receptors, coupled
with hormone availability (from either the fetal
or the maternal thyroid gland), probably plays a
part in the locally restricted, fine-tuning control
of t3 actions on discrete groups of neurons. this
control is disrupted when d3 is deleted, leading
to long-lasting consequences.60
phenotype of mice with mutant,
dominant, negative receptors

if the effects of hypothyroidism are due, at
least in part, to the activity of unliganded
receptors, then expression of mutant receptors with dominant negative activity (i.e. with
intact dna binding but reduced or absent t3
binding) should lead to a situation similar to
hypothyroidism (see figure 1d).

several models have been reported and,
although each study focuses on different targets,
they all illustrate the adverse consequences of
expressing mutant receptors. in one of these
studies, the consequences of expressing mutated
tralpha1 or trbeta1 with dominant negative activity
were analyzed on brain glucose consumption.61
these studies used the pv mutation, identified in the  xxxg2284xxx  gene from a patient with an
extremely severe form of resistance to thyroid
hormone.62 the mutant receptor did not bind
t3 and displayed strong dominant negative
activity, which was the cause of the severity of
the syndrome. knockin mice expressing genes
encoding tralpha1 or trbeta1 with the same mutation
were produced. expression of the mutant tralpha1
led to a strong inhibition of glucose uptake by
the brain in adult mice, whereas expression of
mutant trbeta1 was without effect. the results
of these studies were in agreement with the relative abundance of tralpha1 versus trbeta1 in the
brain, as explained above.
in another study, expression of the mutant
trbeta1 led to hypothyroid-like features of
cerebellar morphology with greatly arrested
purkinje cell differentiation and motor deficits,
in agreement with the predominant expression
of trbeta1 in purkinje cells.43
phenotypic analysis of mice expressing
a mutated tralpha1 has an additional feature
of interest when searching for mutations in
humans. in contrast to  xxxg2284xxx , mutations of
which are known to cause the syndrome of resistance to thyroid hormone,62 mutations affecting
tralpha1 have not been described in humans. the
reason is probably not that the mutation is lethal,
because mice heterozygous for  xxxg2283xxx  mutations
at least survive to adulthood. the analysis of
mice with a tralpha1 mutation could help to define
a phenotype and, therefore, identify the human
patients. in the pv mutants mentioned above,
the mutation completely abolished t3 binding,
and expression of the mutated receptors led
to severely arrested growth. the tralpha1 mutant
mice described by liu et al.63 had increased tsh
levels, impaired lipolysis, and visceral adiposity.
no data were reported on brain phenotype,
but the mutant receptor arrested neuronal
differentiation of stem cells.64
tinnikov et al.65 generated mice with a point
mutation in tralpha1 that did not completely
abolish t3 binding but reduced the binding
affinity about 10-fold. the mice displayed

minimal or no changes of blood tsh and
thyroid hormone levels. homozygous mice did
not survive longer than 2−3 weeks after birth.
heterozygous mice displayed alterations of cerebellar development similar to hypothyroidism,
with delayed granular cell migration,66 and the
mice displayed a significant reduction in motor
coordination. but the more striking finding was
severe ‘anxiety-related’ behavior.66 in several
tests, the mutant mice spent a high proportion of the time ‘freezing’, or motionless, and
displayed less rearing and exploratory behavior
than the wild-type animals.
because the mutation did not completely
abolish t3 binding, the effect of t3 administered at high doses could be tested. the motor
coordination defect could be prevented only by
t3 administration during the postnatal period.
administration of this hormone for just 2 weeks
before the tests had no effect in adult mice.
conversely, the anxiety-like state could only be
prevented by t3 treatment of the adult mice just
before the tests, whereas if treatment was given
in the postnatal period to prevent developmental
effects, it was without effect. expression of the
mutant receptor during development, therefore, induced irreversible alterations, similar to
hypothyroidism, which were prevented only
with early thyroid hormone treatment. by
contrast, the mood disorder in adult animals
was a consequence of reversible impairment
of brain function and not due to an earlier
developmental lesion.
the results indicate that trs are involved in
adult brain functions that modulate behavior.
in a search for the anatomical substrate of the
altered behavior, we found that the mutant
receptor induced reversible morphological alterations in the hippocampus. specifically, there
was a decreased number of a subpopulation
of gabaergic interneurons and lower density
of perisomatic terminals from these cells on the
pyramidal cells of the ca1 region.
the alteration of these cells has not been
proven to be the cause of the altered behavior
but, interestingly, adult tralpha1 knockout animals
displayed abnormal fear-related behavior
of hippocampal origin and similar alterations of hippocampal structure.67 the affected
interneurons predominantly express the tralpha1
receptor subtype and, therefore, either absence
of receptor or expression of a dominant negative receptor could lead to similar defects. these

of the adult brain, with behavioral consequences.

the hippocampus of adult rats.
conclusions

the use of mice deficient in thyroid hormone
receptors or expressing dominant negative
versions of the receptors has provided essential
data to understand the role of thyroid hormones
in brain development and function. the effects
of profound hypothyroidism are probably due,
at least in part, to the unregulated actions of
the unliganded receptors, more so than to the
lack of hormone itself. the physiological roles
of thyroid hormones should, therefore, be
re-examined with further analysis of receptor
mutants. an important question in this respect
is whether the unliganded receptor has a physiological role during early development, by maintaining subsets of genes repressed until induction
by the hormone.
key points
■

thyroid hormones are important in brain
development by regulating cell migration and
differentiation, synaptogenesis, and myelination

■

the early steps of embryonic neural
development, such as neural induction,
neurulation, and establishment of polarity and
segmentation, are probably not influenced by
thyroid hormones

■

deficient production of maternal thyroid
hormones during the first half of gestation
may lead to neurological deficits and is
a primary factor in the pathogenesis of
neurological cretinism

■

gene regulation by thyroid hormones in
brain follows a strict temporal and regional
specificity; most genes are sensitive only during
a limited time period of postnatal development,
and some genes are under thyroid hormone
control only in certain brain regions

■

some of the morphological alterations
induced by profound hypothyroidism might
actually be a consequence of the altered
transcriptional activity of unliganded
receptors; receptor deletion is therefore not
equivalent to hormone deprivation

■

unlike deletion of the thyroid  xxxg1603xxx ,
expression of dominant negative receptors
produces a phenotype more similar to the
hypothyroid phenotype
