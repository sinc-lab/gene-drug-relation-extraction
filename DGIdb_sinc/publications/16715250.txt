abstract
background nicotine is of therapeutic value in ulcerative
colitis, but its administration is connected with adverse
events. nicotine derivatives are currently being tested to
maintain the therapeutic effects and minimize adverse
events.  xxxd3133xxx -12 is a (e)- xxxd3133xxx  hemigalactarate.
the aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of
 xxxd3133xxx -12 in the inhibition of tnf- and lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced cell activation.
methods colonic epithelial cells (cec), monocytes
(mm6), granulocytes, and the intestinal epithelial cell line
ht-29 were stimulated with tnf and lps and treated with
 xxxd3133xxx -12. il-8 secretion in the cell supernatants and  xxxg1559xxx  activation were determined by elisa. apoptosis was
quantified by flow cytometry.
results in mm6 cells, il-8 secretion was significantly
decreased to 30% of control after  xxxd3133xxx -12 treatment,
with best results after pretreatment for 24 h. this decrease
in cell activation was not due to apoptosis and was not
mediated by inhibition of  xxxg1559xxx  activation. il-8 production

in neutrophils and primary cec also tended to be decreased
after  xxxd3133xxx -12 treatment.  xxxd3133xxx -12 had no influence
on il-8 secretion of ht-29 cells.
conclusion  xxxd3133xxx -12 effectively inhibited tnf- and
lps-induced il-8 production in different cell types. no
toxic effects occurred at the concentrations used. preincubation of cells with  xxxd3133xxx -12 showed the best effects.

introduction
crohn’s disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc) are both
inflammatory bowel diseases (ibds) of unknown etiology.
different genetic factors are thought to predispose individuals to the development of ibd, and a role for the colonic
flora and infective agents has been raised by several reports
[1]. also, environmental factors play an important role in
the pathophysiology of ibd [2]. ibds are characterized by
an uncontrolled immune response resulting in chronic
inflammation of the intestine and by alternating episodes
of activity and remission [3, 4]. proinflammatory cytokines
and chemokines maintain the intestinal inflammation by
mediating a constant influx of leukocytes out of the blood
stream into the mucosa [5].
conventional corticosteroids are a major component of
ibd therapy, although they have many disadvantages and
side effects, which increase during chronic steroid therapy
[6]. topically and orally administered aminosalicylates are
widely used in mildly to moderately active uc. also,
immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive agents are

304

used to treat cd and uc. newer agents are biological
therapies also referred to as “biologics,” including anti-tnf
alpha antibodies, second-generation glucocorticoids, and
nicotine patches or enemas [7].
about 20 years ago, the association of nonsmoking with
uc was first defined [8, 9], followed by the observation
that cd patients were more often smokers [10, 11]. since
the detection of the contrasting association for smoking
with ibd, many studies have been carried out to identify
pathogenic mechanisms for cd and uc [12].
the observation that smoking reduces the risk of
developing uc led to the hypothesis that nicotine, as one
of the main compounds in tobacco, is responsible for this
beneficial effect [13, 14]. as it is unethical to enforce uc
patients to start smoking, nicotine was administered as
nicotine patches or enemas in clinical studies on therapy for
uc with promising results, such as the reduction of stool
frequency and mucosal inflammation [15]. at present, the
mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of nicotine in
uc are unknown. evidence indicates that nicotine (1)
induces the release of endogenous glucocorticoids and
inhibits the production of inflammatory mediators such as
eicosanoids [16], (2) modulates mucosal blood flow [17],
(3) increases mucous production [18], and (4) decreases
intestinal permeability [19]. in vitro and in vivo studies
have demonstrated the immunomodulatory effects of
nicotine by the decreased production of  xxxg1170xxx , il-2, il-8,
il-10, and  xxxg2296xxx  in blood mononuclear cells and in the
colonic tissue of control and uc patients and decreased
levels of these proinflammatory cytokines in the colonic
tissue of rodents and patients with uc. [20, 21]. however,
the safety profile of nicotine is unacceptable, particularly
with regard to nausea and cardiovascular side effects.
therefore, new nicotine derivatives are currently being
developed to maintain the therapeutic effects of nicotine
and to minimize occurring adverse events. for example,
nicotine tartrate liquid enemas are used to treat mildly to
moderately active left-sided uc and seem to result in
clinical improvement [22].
the compound  xxxd3133xxx -12, which is the hemigalactarate salt of (e)- xxxd3133xxx , was developed by
targacept. the results of in vitro studies of  xxxd3133xxx 
suggest that  xxxd3133xxx  interacts with and activates cns
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachrs) and has a
reduced activity when compared to nicotine at muscle
and ganglionic nachrs [23–25]. although  xxxd3133xxx 
demonstrates cns alpha4beta2 selectivity, it may also offer
protective and therapeutic effects in uc through the
activation of specific nachrs. in vitro studies have
shown that this compound activates alpha3beta2-like nachrs,
the predominant nachr subtype in myenteric neurons.
these data indicate that  xxxd3133xxx -12 may be an excellent
candidate in the management of uc.

the aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness
of  xxxd3133xxx -12 in inhibiting the production of the proinflammatory cytokine il-8 in cells present in the inflamed
intestinal mucosa.

materials and methods
culture of cell lines
the intestinal epithelial cell line ht-29 (lgc promochem,
wesel, germany) was cultured in dulbecco’s modified
eagle’s medium (dmem, biochrom, berlin, germany)
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (fcs, pan
systems, aidenbach, germany), 1% sodium pyruvate
(biochrom), and 1% nonessential amino acids (biochrom).
the monocytic cell line  xxxg866xxx  6 (mm6, lgc
promochem) was cultured in rpmi (sigma-aldrich,
munich, germany) supplemented with 10% fcs, 1%
nonessential amino acids, and 1% oxalacetic acid–pyruvate–insulin medium supplement (sigma-aldrich).
isolation of primary neutrophil granulocytes
primary neutrophil granulocytes were isolated from the
peripheral blood of healthy volunteers. peripheral blood
collected in edta vials (sarstedt, nümbrecht, germany)
was diluted with the same amount of phosphate-buffered
saline (pbs) (biochrom).  xxxd3253xxx /hypaque, 20 ml, (paa,
cölbe, germany) was overlayed with 20 ml of the blood/
pbs mixture and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 20 min
(without brake). the supernatant was discarded and, for
hypotone lysis of erythrocytes, the remaining pellet was
treated with 8 ml of 0.2% nacl (sigma-aldrich) for 20 s,
followed by 8 ml of 1.6% nacl for 20 s. tubes were filled
to 50 ml with pbs and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 15 min
at 4°c. the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was
washed twice and incubated with 20 ml/tube lysing buffer
(nh4cl 8.27 g/l, nahco3 1 g/l, na-edta 0.04 g/l, all
sigma-aldrich) for 10 min on ice. then, 30 ml pbs/tube
was added and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°c.
the supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet was
resuspended in 5 ml of cell culture medium (dmem
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/
streptomycin mixture, 1% nonessential amino acids, and
1% sodium pyruvate) and counted.
isolation of primary colonic epithelial cells (cec)
epithelial cells were isolated from surgical specimens from
noninflamed areas of colonic mucosa as described previously [26]. specimens were washed with pbs and the
mucosa was separated from the muscularis with a scalpel.

int j colorectal dis (2007) 22:303–312

the mucosa was washed with pbs and the mucus layer
was removed by vigorous shaking of the mucosa in a 1 mm
dithiothreitol solution (dtt, mp biomedicals, irvine, ca,
usa) in pbs at 37°c for 15 min. the supernatant was
discarded and the remaining dtt was removed by washing
with pbs. epithelial cells (crypts) were separated by
shaking the specimens in 2 mm edta (roth gmbh &
co., karlsruhe, germany) in hanks’ buffered salt solution
(gibco/invitrogen, karlsruhe, germany) for 10 min at
37°c. the suspension was centrifuged at 225 rpm and
washed with pbs until the supernatant remained clear. the
first fraction of the crypts was discarded. the different
fractions containing crypts were combined and washed with
pbs. the combined pellet was resuspended in 10–15 ml
medium [quantum 286 with l-glutamine (paa), serum free
supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 0.1%
 xxxd2193xxx  (paa)] and filled into the collagen-coated, 6well filter inserts (millipore gmbh, eschborn, germany)
[26].

flow cytometry
for flow cytometrical analysis of the pre-g1 peak (apoptotic cells), mm6 cells were harvested, washed with pbs, and
centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 5 min. then, 1×106 cells were
resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold methanol (70%) and
incubated overnight at −20°c. cells were washed twice
with pbs and resuspended in 470 mul of pbs. to prevent
interactions between rna and  xxxd3027xxx  iodine (pi), cells
were treated with  xxxg1963xxx  (10 mug/ml end concentration)
for 30 min at 37°c. the cell suspension was incubated with
50 mug/ml (end concentration) pi for 20 min on ice in the
dark. pi fluorescence was measured in the fl3 channel of a
coulter epics xl-mcl (coulter, krefeld, germany).
data acquisition and analysis were performed using
windows multiple document interface software (http://
facs.scripps.edu/help/html/).

preparation of nuclear extracts
stimulation experiments
optimum stimulation concentrations of lipopolysaccharide
(lps) (sigma-aldrich) and tnf (sigma-aldrich) for the
different cell types were determined by dose response
experiments. mm6 cells and granulocytes were stimulated
with 1 ng/ml lps and 5 ng/ml tnf, ht-29 cells were
stimulated with 100 ng/ml lps and 5 ng/ml tnf, and
colonic epithelial cells (cecs) were stimulated with 20
ng/ml tnf.  xxxd3133xxx -12 was added at concentrations of
1 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, and 100 ng/ml.
different protocols for cell stimulation were applied.
cells were either stimulated with lps or tnf and treated
with  xxxd3133xxx -12 (for 24 h) at the same time, or
pretreatment with  xxxd3133xxx -12 (24 h) was followed by
stimulation with lps or tnf for another 24 h. also,
experiments with pretreatment of the different cell types
with  xxxd3133xxx -12 for 24 h followed by stimulation with
tnf or lps under the addition of a second dose of  xxxd3133xxx -12 in the same concentration as the pretreatment for
another 24 h were performed.
all cells were seeded at a density of 100,000 cells/well
into 24-well plates. adherent ht-29 cells were incubated
for 48 h until subconfluency in the normal cell culture
medium. the medium was then replaced by cell culture
medium without fcs and cells were stimulated according
to the different protocols described above.

nuclear extracts were prepared as described earlier [27].
briefly, 500,000 cells were incubated with buffer a (tris
10 mm, kcl 60 mm, edta 1 mm, and dtt 1 mm) for
5 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 2,500 rpm for
3 min. supernatants were discarded and pellets were
resuspended in 1 ml of buffer b [4 ml of the nonionic
detergent nonidet p40 (roche, grenzach-wyhlen,
germany) + 96 ml buffer a]. after 3 min of incubation
on ice, samples were centrifuged at 2,500 rpm for 3 min.
pellets were washed in 1 ml of buffer a and resuspended
in 40 mul of buffer c (nuclear lysis buffer: tris 20 mm,
nacl 0.4 m, mgcl2 × 6 h2o 1.5 mm, edta 1.5 mm,
dtt 1 mm, glycerine 25%, 1 tablet of complete mini,
roche, mannheim, germany). samples were vortexed,
followed by incubation two times for 5 min on ice. after
centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, supernatants
(nuclear extracts) were collected, shock frozen, and stored
at −80°c until used.

 xxxg1559xxx  elisa
activation of  xxxg1559xxx  was measured using a commercially
available p65 elisa (active motif, rixensart, belgium)
according to the manufacturers’ instructions.
statistical analysis

il-8 elisa
il-8 in the supernatants of stimulated cells was quantified
by a elisa kit (endogen/perbio, bonn, germany),
according to the manufacturers’ instructions.

all data are expressed as mean±standard deviation. statistical significance was determined by student’s t test or
mann–whitney. a value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

results
 xxxd3133xxx -12 decreased il-8 secretion of monocytes (mm6)
mm-6 cells were stimulated with 5 ng/ml tnf or 1 ng/ml
lps. absolute il-8 levels under these stimulation conditions were about twice as high for lps stimulation as
compared to tnf incubation, but varied between the
experiments. therefore, data are given as percent of
control: basal il-8 secretion of mm6 cells was in a range
of 0.52–5.18 pg/mug cell protein. tnf stimulation of mm6
cells caused an increase of il-8 secretion to 5.1–16.50 pg
il-8/mug cell protein. lps stimulation was followed by an
increase of il-8 secretion to a range of 17.8–32.6 pg/mug
cell protein.
when the nicotine derivative was given together with the
stimulus, the production of il-8 was decreased to 40% of
controls in tnf-stimulated mm6 cells compared to
untreated controls, with best results at a  xxxd3133xxx -12
concentration of 1 ng/ml (n=3; p=0.015; t test). in lps-

the rate of apoptosis of  xxxd3133xxx -12 treated and stimulated
mm6 cells was determined to exclude toxic effects of tc24032 and to test the viability of cells. cells were stained
with pi and apoptosis was determined by flow cytometrical
pre-g1 peak quantification. mm6 cells were pretreated with
 xxxd3133xxx -12 for 24 h, then stimulated with tnf or lps,
and at the same time-point, a second dose of the nicotine
derivative was added.
apoptosis in nonstimulated cells ranged from 11–19%.
stimulation of the cells with tnf resulted in 22% of preg1 cells. in tnf-stimulated and  xxxd3133xxx -12-treated cells,
the highest apoptosis rate detected was 33%. (fig. 2a; n=2).
stimulation with lps resulted in 21% of apoptotic cells. in
lps-stimulated and  xxxd3133xxx -12-treated cells, the highest
apoptosis rate detected was 25% (fig. 2b; n=2).
higher apoptosis rates did not correlate with decreased
levels of il-8 in the supernatants of these cells. these
results indicate that increased rates of apoptosis of tc24032-treated mm6 cells were not responsible for the
decreased production of il-8 found in these cells.

that had shown the highest effects in the stimulation
experiments described above (1, 10, and 100 ng/ml). cells
were stimulated for 2 h.
no significant down-regulation of  xxxg1559xxx  activation and
translocation could be observed after  xxxd3133xxx -12 treatment.
similar results were obtained in the three different stimulation
experiments, no matter if the nicotine derivative was given
together with the stimulus (fig. 3a) or the cells were
stimulated with lps after pretreatment with  xxxd3133xxx -12
for 24 h without (fig. 3b) or under the addition of a second
dose  xxxd3133xxx -12 (fig. 3c). these results indicate that the
observed reduction of il-8 production in  xxxd3133xxx -12treated mm6 cells was not mediated via inhibition of the
 xxxg1559xxx  pathway.

dose response experiments were carried out to determine
the optimum concentration of tnf for stimulation of
primary cecs. in the following experiments, cells were
stimulated with 20 ng/ml tnf. the same stimulation
experiments as described above were carried out with
primary cecs.
when primary cecs were stimulated in parallel with
20 ng/ml tnf and  xxxd3133xxx -12  xxxd1891xxx  and 100 ng/ml, the
secretion of il-8 into the culture medium was reduced to
35% of controls. the same tendency could be observed in
all experiments, but results were not statistically significant
due to the different stimulation capacities of cells from
different patients (fig. 5a).
when primary cecs were pretreated with  xxxd3133xxx -12
for 24 h followed by stimulation with 20 ng/ml tnf, an
effect on the il-8 secretion could only be detected at a
concentration of 100 ng/ml  xxxd3133xxx -12 with an about
50% reduction of il-8 in the culture medium (fig. 5b) (not
statistically significant).
in primary cecs pretreated with  xxxd3133xxx -12  xxxd1891xxx  and
100 ng/ml for 24 h and stimulated with 20 ng/ml tnf
under addition of a second dose of  xxxd3133xxx -12, a 40%
reduction of the il-8 secretion could be detected (fig. 5c).

fig. 5 influence of  xxxd3133xxx -12 on the il-8 secretion of primary
intestinal epithelial cells. primary intestinal epithelial cells were
isolated from noninflamed areas of surgical specimens. a cells were
stimulated with 20 ng/ml tnf under the addition of 10 or 100 ng/ml
 xxxd3133xxx -12 at the same time-point. il-8 secretion was measured after
24 h by elisa. il-8 secretion of primary intestinal epithelial cells
was determined after pretreatment of the cells with 10 or 100 ng/ml
 xxxd3133xxx -12 for 24 h, followed by stimulation with 20 ng/ml tnf for,
again, 24 h without (b) or under the addition of a second dose of  xxxd3133xxx -12 (c)

different sets of stimulation experiments were carried out
to test the influence of  xxxd3133xxx -12 on il-8 secretion of the
intestinal epithelial cell line ht-29. the nicotine derivative
was either added together with the stimulus (tnf or lps)
or cells were pretreated with  xxxd3133xxx -12 for 24 h followed
by stimulation with or without the addition of a second
dose of  xxxd3133xxx -12. production of il-8 in ht-29 cells
could not be influenced when tnf or lps were added
together with  xxxd3133xxx -12 (fig. 6a,b; n=3). pretreatment
with  xxxd3133xxx -12 for 24 h followed by stimulation with
tnf or lps for 24 h also had no effect on il-8 production
in ht-29 cells (fig. 6c,d; n=3). the same was true for
pretreatment with  xxxd3133xxx -12 followed by stimulation
with tnf or lps and an additional dose of  xxxd3133xxx -12
at the same concentration (fig. 6e,f; n=3).

knowledge of their expression and function led to their use

in this study the influence of a new nicotine derivative
 xxxd3133xxx -12, (e)- xxxd3133xxx  hemigalactarate, on the  xxxg562xxx  production of different cells (intestinal epithelial cells,
monocytes, and neutrophils) present in colitis mucosa was
determined. cells were stimulated with tnf or lps to
create an inflammatory situation and to induce the production of il-8 as a readout of cell activation.  xxxd3133xxx -12 was
given either in a preventive or a treatment setting.
the results obtained in this study indicate that the new
nicotine derivative  xxxd3133xxx -12 is effective in inhibiting the
secretion of the proinflammatory chemokine il-8 in different cell populations present in the inflamed gut. the

mechanisms responsible for this down-regulation need to
be elucidated.
as the nachr is a pentamer containing different
combinations of a possible 16 monomers, the precise
identification of this receptor on different cell populations
is difficult. for macrophages, wang and coworkers could
identify the relevant nachr as comprising five copies of
the monomer alpha7 subunit. the alpha7 subunit of the
human nachr has been shown to be essential for antiinflammatory effects of nicotine in monocuclear cells [29].
summers et al. showed that mrna for  xxxg836xxx ,  xxxg833xxx ,
 xxxg834xxx  and  xxxg458xxx  subunits, but not for  xxxg832xxx 
beta2 subunits is present in ht-29 cells [30]. in vitro
studies have shown that  xxxd3133xxx  activates alpha3beta2-like

int j colorectal dis (2007) 22:303–312

nachrs, the predominant nachr subtype in myenteric
neurons [31].
in the intestinal epithelial cell line ht-29, no effect of  xxxd3133xxx -12 on the il-8 secretion of stimulated cells could be
detected. these results indicate that other nachr subunits
than  xxxg836xxx ,  xxxg833xxx ,  xxxg834xxx , and alpha7 may be necessary for
the mediation of the anti-inflammatory effects of tc-240312. in cecs, in contrast to the intestinal epithelial cell line
ht-29, a tendency toward a decrease in the secretion of  xxxg562xxx  could be observed. wang et al. showed that human
bronchial epithelial cells and aortic endothelial cells express
nachr  xxxg832xxx  and alpha7 subunits [32].
several studies concerning the nachr subunit expression in monocytes and macrophages have been carried out.
the alpha7 subunit of nachrs seems to be responsible for the
mediation of anti-inflammatory effects of nicotine in
macrophages [29].
il-8 production of the monocytic cell line mm6 could
be reduced up to 70% by treatment with  xxxd3133xxx -12. this
reduction was not mediated by inhibition of the  xxxg1559xxx 
pathway, as no nuclear reduction of the active  xxxg1559xxx 
subunit p65 could be observed, although secretion of  xxxg562xxx  was diminished in  xxxd3133xxx -12-treated cells compared to
untreated controls. in addition, the decrease of il-8 secretion into the medium was not due to increased apoptosis or
cell death in  xxxd3133xxx -12-treated mm6 cells. the experiments carried out with primary neutrophils showed a
tendency of  xxxd3133xxx -12 to reduce the production of the
proinflammatory cytokine il-8, but the results were not
statistically significant. surprisingly, 1 ng/ml seemed to be
most effective in mm6 cells. the lower anti-inflammatory
effect of  xxxd3133xxx -12 at higher concentrations may have
several causes: although  xxxd3133xxx  demonstrates cns
alpha4beta2 selectivity, it may also activate other acetylcholine
receptors. in vitro studies have shown that  xxxd3133xxx -12
mainly activates alpha3beta2-like nachrs, the predominant
nachr subtype in myenteric neurons [24, 25]. the finding
that a  xxxd3133xxx -12 concentration of 1 ng/ml had the
highest anti-inflammatory effectiveness and that higher
concentrations were less effective may be due to binding
of  xxxd3133xxx  to other nachrs at higher concentrations.
in addition, besides nachr-agonistic properties,  xxxd3133xxx  has also been described to have some antagonistic
effects at higher concentrations. further, the time-point of
addition of  xxxd3133xxx  to the cell cultures seemed to be
important.
tnf- but not lps-induced cell activation could be
partially inhibited by  xxxd3133xxx -12. this effect was not
mediated by  xxxg1559xxx . differential effects of nicotine or
nicotine derivatives on different cytokine signaling pathways and effects have already been shown in other
experimental settings: a  xxxg2296xxx  neuroprotective pathway
has been postulated requiring the activation of the  xxxd924xxx /

311

tnfri receptor and the release of neuronal stores of
endogenous  xxxg2296xxx . this tnf-dependent pathway is sensitive to inhibition by nicotine activation of nachralpha7containing receptors [33]. by contrast, il-1-mediated
neuroprotection is not inhibited by nicotine, suggesting
independent pathways [34]. on the other hand, il-8 secretion was about twice as high following lps stimulation as
compared to tnf incubation. therefore, it is possible that
the difference between the “anti-inflammatory” effect of
 xxxd3133xxx -12 between tnf and lps stimulation is due to
the stronger cells’ activation caused by lps.
il-8 is a cxc-chemokine that induces migration of
neutrophils into inflamed tissue [35]. there are several in
vitro studies that indicate an important role of il-8 during
acute and chronic ibd. il-8 levels are strongly upregulated in inflamed tissue during acute and chronic cd
and uc [36]. daig et al. showed that il-8 mrna and
protein is upregulated in iec and lamina propria mononuclear cells of ibd, and especially of uc, patients [37].
active inflammation of the intestinal surface is defined by
the migration of neutrophils from the microvasculature and
across the epithelial surface [38]. enhanced neutrophil
migration into the mucosa and transepithelial neutrophil
migration with the formation of crypt abscesses is a main
feature of uc, which is triggered by the high amounts of
il-8 present in the mucosa of uc patients. therefore, a
reduction of il-8 in the mucosa of ibd patients could have
beneficial effects. our results indicate that  xxxd3133xxx -12 is
effective in inhibiting this inflammatory factor in cells of
the inflamed mucosa and could be of interest in the
treatment of chronic and active uc.
