mutations in  xxxg2100xxx  cause thiamine-responsive megaloblastic
anaemia associated with diabetes mellitus and deafness

thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anaemia ( xxxg2100xxx ), also
known as rogers syndrome, is an early onset, autosomal recessive disorder defined by the occurrence of megaloblastic
anaemia, diabetes mellitus and sensorineural deafness,
responding in varying degrees to thiamine treatment1,2 (mim
249270). we have previously narrowed the  xxxg2100xxx  locus from a
16-cm to a 4-cm interval on chromosomal region 1q23.3
(refs 3,4) and this region has been further refined to a 1.4-cm
interval5. previous studies have suggested that deficiency in a
high-affinity thiamine transporter may cause this disorder6,7.

here we identify the  xxxg2100xxx  gene by positional cloning. we
assembled a p1-derived artificial chromosome (pac) contig
spanning the  xxxg2100xxx  candidate region. this clarified the order of
genetic markers across the  xxxg2100xxx  locus, provided 9 new polymorphic markers and narrowed the locus to an approximately
400-kb region. mutations in a new gene,  xxxg2100xxx , encoding a
putative transmembrane protein homologous to the reduced
folate carrier proteins8,9, were found in all affected individuals
in six  xxxg2100xxx  families, suggesting that a defective thiamine
transporter protein ( xxxg2100xxx ) may underlie the  xxxg2100xxx  syndrome.

we designated as position 1
(at position 1,221 from the start of pac 206d15) was chosen as the translation initiation codon. it conforms in part to kozak’s rules, creating an orf preceded by an
in-frame stop codon at position –162 (relative to the first atg), with a guanine at position +4 (ref. 10). a gc box (gggcgg) was found at –325, a catt box (ccatt)
at –296 and a probable tata box (ttaaact) at –199. f1 primer was used for pcr amplifications. f, structure of the  xxxg2100xxx  transcript derived from the alignment of
est, rt-pcr fragment and cdna clone sequences with genomic sequence. ests are drawn approximately to scale under the transcript (in open boxes). the broken
line connecting ests indicates that they are two ends of the same transcript (5´ and 3´). the boxes under the transcript (prefixed ‘sccd’) depict cdna sequences generated at the sanger centre. an rt-pcr fragment of 1,628 bp (open arrows) was generated using primers ( xxxg2100xxx -rt f2 and r2) encompassing exons 1−6 of
 xxxg2100xxx  cdna. genomic amplification was obtained using primers f1/r1 (477 bp) or f2/r1 (214 bp), whereas rt-pcr product was generated by f2/r2 (1,628 bp).
the inability of primer pair f1/r2 to generate an rt-pcr product indicates that the region encompassing primer f1 lies upstream of the transcription start site12 and
is excluded from the  xxxg2100xxx  transcript. we found several consensus polyadenylation sites (aataaa) at the 3´ end of the gene. we also found 4 distinct ests to end
at position 3,376. the 3.8-kb size of the transcript is consistent with the location of the poly(a) signal at nt 3,782 (middle position).

loss of homozygosity by descent

linkage disequilibrium

fig. 2 haplotypes of key patients from the six families. a refined  xxxg2100xxx  interval was defined based on the region of homozygosity seen in affected individuals of
families 2, 10 and 5 and on linkage disequilibrium seen in two israeli-arab families (families 3 and 4). the refined region is between tmg738c and tmg780 (box).
brackets indicate markers that were not tested. the  xxxg2100xxx  candidate region based on a common region of homozygosity in the affected individuals is shown
(left). the centromeric limit is at tmg738a as defined by the haplotypes of families 2 and 10. the telomeric limit is at tmg780, as defined by the haplotype of
family 5. family 6 did not contribute to the narrowing of the genetic interval and has no common haplotype with family 10. the two families, however, do have
the same mutation. the  xxxg2100xxx  candidate region based on linkage disequilibrium is also shown (right). this phenomenon has been previously observed in these
two unrelated israeli-arab families4. here we tested new markers defining the centromeric limit of the interval at tmg738c.

we previously assigned the  xxxg2100xxx  locus to a 4-cm region
between d1s2658 and d1s2851 on chromosome 1q23.3.
(refs 4,5). here we have refined the  xxxg2100xxx  candidate region by the
genetic analysis of six families previously genotyped by us and the
development of new polymorphic markers on the basis of the
genomic sequence information from the sanger centre chromosome 1 mapping and sequencing group (fig. 1). we assembled a
physical map of the  xxxg2100xxx  candidate region. high-resolution
pac contigs 196 and 13, including 16 pac clones (fig. 1b,d), represented the minimum tiling path between d1s2658 (centromeric
end) and d1s2851 (telomeric end). this enabled us to confirm
the order of known markers (d1s2658, d1s433 and d1s1569).
d1s2851 did not map to any of the pac clones, consistent with
the existence of a gap near this marker. we identified nine new
ca-repeat markers and found them to be polymorphic in the
population tested (fig. 1c). we constructed full haplotypes for all
informative individuals in the six families. on the basis of loss of
homozygosity by descent and linkage disequilibrium, we obtained
a new  xxxg2100xxx  candidate region between tmg738c and tmg780
(fig. 2). recently, the  xxxg2100xxx  locus was narrowed to a 1.4-cm
interval between markers d1s3464 and d1s1619/d1s2851
(ref. 5). we found d1s3464 to map on our contig to pac 1018k9
(fig. 1c), permitting the refinement of the  xxxg2100xxx  critical region
between d1s3464 and tmg780. we calculated the physical distance between these markers to be approximately 400 kb, based on
the length of the pac clones spanning the new interval.
we searched for candidate genes in the available genomic
sequence of the candidate region using computer analysis, and
identified four known genes (atp1b1, encoding human na,katpase  xxxg217xxx ; jem-1, encoding basic leucine zipper; f5,
encoding  xxxg749xxx ; and  xxxg2049xxx , encoding  xxxg2049xxx )
and two new genes ( xxxg2100xxx  and an unknown gene; fig. 1c).
direct sequence analysis of affected  xxxg2100xxx  subjects excluded the
atp1b1 and jem-1 genes; no mutations were found (data not
shown). we then focused on  xxxg2100xxx , belonging to the fully
sequenced pac 206d15 and annotated by sanger as encoding a
reduced folate carrier protein due to blastx (ref. 10) homology
with slc19a1, encoding the reduced folate carrier 1 (rfc-1;
refs 8,9). this potential vitamin transporter thus represented

both a positional and functional candidate for  xxxg2100xxx ; it has been
suggested that  xxxg2100xxx  might be due to a defect in a high-affinity
thiamine transporter6,7.
 xxxg2100xxx  consists of 6 exons spanning approximately 22.5 kb
(fig. 1e). a northern blot of poly(a)+ rna generated a unique
transcript of approximately 3.8 kb. northern-blot analysis combined with pcr of cdnas from various tissues revealed expression of the gene in all tissues tested, including pancreas, placenta,
heart, brain, liver, skeletal muscle, retina, bone marrow and
fibroblasts (fig. 3a). we observed higher mrna expression in
skeletal muscle, heart and placenta. this pattern of expression,
reinforced with the expression pattern of ten matched ests
(fig. 1f), is consistent with the multi-system manifestations of
the disease. to confirm the exon-intron boundaries of the gene,
we compiled a consensus cdna sequence by aligning the dna
sequences of cdna clones generated at sanger, the ests and an
rt-pcr fragment with the genomic sequence of the predicted
gene (fig. 1e,f). this cdna sequence consisted of 3,792 nt that
includes a predicted 1,494-bp orf (encoding a protein of 497
aa), consistent with the approximately 3.8-kb size of the transcript (fig. 1f). the atg translation start codon is preceded by an
in-frame stop codon (fig. 1e), with a guanine at position +4,
conforming to kozak’s rules11. a cdna defining the transcription start with the same initiation codon has now been identified
by fleming et al.12, who have used a functional approach to identify the disease gene.
we found homology between  xxxg2100xxx  and slc19a1 in various species at the amino acid, but not the nucleotide, level, with
exons 2 and 5 being the most conserved (fig. 3b). hydrophobicity analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed a predicted topology with ten putative transmembrane domains
(fig. 3b,c).  xxxg2100xxx  has a topology similar to that of rfc-1 proteins and various glucose transporters, reinforcing its possible
role as a transporter (data not shown).
we identified four different mutations in the six families
(fig. 4). predicted changes in the protein structure are shown
(table 1 and fig. 3b,c). in unrelated israeli-arab families 3 and 4,
we found a cytosine deletion at position 724, predicting a
frameshift at codon 242 with premature termination at codon

fig. 3 rna expression levels, protein sequence and topology. a, expression of  xxxg2100xxx  in various human tissues. a northern blot of multiple human tissues was
hybridized with a genomic fragment derived from  xxxg2100xxx  exon 2 (top left). an identical profile was obtained using a genomic probe of  xxxg2100xxx  exon 3. the position of the 3.8-kb transcript is marked (arrowhead). a human  xxxg53xxx  probe (bottom left) was used as a lane loading control. expression of  xxxg2100xxx  was also analysed
by rt-pcr using primers f2/r2 (top right) in cdnas from retina and bone marrow and in cdnas from lymphocytes and fibroblasts. amplification with  xxxg53xxx  primers
was used as control (bottom right). b, predicted amino acid sequence of  xxxg2100xxx  compared with human, mouse and hamster rfc-1 proteins (rfc1-h, rfc1-m and
flo1, respectively). numbers on the right side of the figure indicate amino acid positions. identical residues are boxed and shaded. similar residues are boxed. dashes
indicate gaps introduced to align the sequences. exons 2 and 5 are the most conserved between  xxxg2100xxx  and other rfc-1 proteins. specifically within exons 2 and 5,
rfc-1 proteins share 73−76% and 72−74% similarity and 42−43% and 54−56% identity with  xxxg2100xxx , respectively. the horizontal bold lines above the sequence indicate the ten transmembrane domains predicted for  xxxg2100xxx  by tmpred. the positions of identified mutations and the splice junction are shown. , splice junction
between codons; , intra-codon splice junction. c, predicted topology of  xxxg2100xxx  across the cell membrane. the positions of mutations identified are indicated.

259. all five affected sibs of these two families were homozygous for this mutation. quantitative rt-pcr of two of these
patients did not reveal any change in expression compared
with control subjects (data not shown). the fact that the same
mutation occurred in two families was consistent with the
linkage disequilibrium phenomenon observed in the disease
haplotypes (fig. 2) and with the existence of a founder mutation. in two ethnically distinct families (pakistan 6 and japan
10), we identified the same c→t nonsense homozygous mutation at position 484, predicting a premature truncated protein
at codon 162. the surrounding haplotype is quite different in
these two families, suggesting that this mutation has arisen
twice through separate mutational events. we found a g→a
nonsense homozygous mutation at position 750 in an indian
family (family 5), predicting premature termination of the
protein at codon 250. finally, we observed a homozygous
g→a missense mutation at position 515, which is predicted to
replace glycine with aspartate, in family 2 of italian origin. this

seemingly more benign mutation affects a residue that is evolutionarily conserved in  xxxg2100xxx  and human, mouse and hamster folate carrier proteins (fig. 3b). all mutations occurred in
exon 2, suggesting functional significance of the downstreamencoded protein region (fig. 3b,c).
the function of  xxxg2100xxx  has now been identified by fleming
et al. as being a high-affinity thiamine transporter12, consistent
with our homology studies and previous data6,7. it is also possible that  xxxg2100xxx  transports reduced folate and methotrexate,
similar to its relative rfc-1 (ref. 8). in view of the multi-system manifestations of  xxxg2100xxx , the identification of  xxxg2100xxx 
might uncover the role of thiamine in glucose homeostasis,
deafness and megaloblastic anaemia. mutations in  xxxg2100xxx 
might also be a cause of partial expression of the components
of the  xxxg2100xxx  triad. genome scans for both type i and type ii
diabetes mellitus have implicated genes in the 1q region13,14.
thus,  xxxg2100xxx  may have a role in these more common forms
of diabetes.

mutations, we also screened the parents and siblings of
affected individuals to verify that the defined mutations were
appropriately co-inherited with the disease in each pedigree.
we found these data to be consistent with previous haplotype analysis of the six families3,4.

methods
patients and families. we included 6 unrelated kindreds (12 affected individuals) of diverse ethnic origins in this study: 2 are israeli-arab, 1 pakistani, 1 japanese, 1 indian and 1 italian. the clinical histories and basis for
diagnosis of these families have been described3,4. among the families,
three reported a history of consanguinity; however, they were all shown to
be linked to the 1q23.3 region based on homozygous markers3,4. we performed the study according to a protocol reviewed and approved by the
local helsinki committee.
identification of new markers on pacs. we searched the nucleotide
sequences published by the sanger centre (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/hgp/
chr1) of pac contigs 13 and 196 using a text editor for long ca repeats (14
repeats or longer). we designed primers for nine ca repeats found in these
pacs (table 2).
ordering of markers on pacs. we used pacs from the pac contigs 13
and 196 (sanger centre) to verify the location of all known markers
(pac clones 747l4, 1059h15, 1082d3, 968d22, 738p11, 797m17,
10c16, 1018k9, 800f24, 111f19, 206d15, 86f14, 780m13, 117p20,
97p20 and 190i16). we grew pac clones as colonies on lb agar plates
containing kanamycin (75 µg/ml). we obtained dna from each pac by
diluting a single colony for each of them in distilled and sterile water
(500 µl), and used it directly as template for pcr reactions. we per-

formed pcr for markers d1s2658, d1s433, d1s1569 and d1s2851 on
these clones using the primers designed by genethon15. we carried out
pcr reactions for all markers using pac dilution (2 µl), primers (1 µm
of each),  xxxd1148xxx ,  xxxd1837xxx , dctp and dttp (200 µm of each), taq polymerase (1 u) and amplification buffer (3 µl; 10×) provided by the
enzyme supplier. the total volume of the reaction was 30 µl. amplification conditions were as follows: 95 °c for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of
30 s denaturation at 95 °c; 30 s annealing at 55 °c (genethon markers);
and 30 s elongation at 72 °c. we completed the reaction by a final elongation step of 6 min at 72 °c. annealing temperatures for the new markers are shown (table 2). we assayed pcr products by separation on 2%
agarose gels. we found that marker d1s3464 (ref. 5) mapped to pac
1018k9 by searching the primer sequences on the available pac
sequences using a text editor and pcr mapping.

genotyping analysis. we used either known markers (d1s2851,
d1s2658, d1s433, d1s1569) reported in the genethon microsatellite
map15 or new ca repeat markers we found on pac clones. we performed
genotyping of the affected individuals, their healthy siblings and their
parents using a non-radioactive labelling procedure with the ecl system
(amersham) based on a horseradish peroxidase-mediated chemiluminescent reaction16. we then constructed haplotypes to define a new
 xxxg2100xxx  critical region.

identification of candidate genes. we reviewed the sequence analysis, published by the sanger centre, of all pacs inside our critical region, which are
fully sequenced. this analysis included the listing of all known genes located on the pacs and a gene prediction analysis. we also reviewed the
sequence of pacs that are only partially sequenced by the sanger centre.
information on finished or unfinished sequenced clones is available
(ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/human/sequences/chr1/ or ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.
uk/pub/human/sequences/chr1/unfinishedsequence/). full analysis of
particular clones is also available (http://webace.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/
webace?db=acedb1).
we masked the available sequence of each of the pacs using the repeatmasker server (http://ftp.genome.washington.edu/cgi-bin/repeatmasker).
then, we conducted a blast search (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgibin/blast/nph-newblast) on the masked sequences to find all homologous known genes (nucleotide (nr) databases), proteins (swiss-protein)
and est clusters17 (dbest).
we checked the information published on each est cluster, noting the
tissue types in which they were expressed (http://www.tigr.org/tdb/
hgi/hgi.html and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/nucleotide.html)
and possible matches to exons of known or predicted genes.
 xxxg2100xxx  cdna sequence assembly. we isolated mrna from eb-transformed lymphoblastoid cells or primary fibroblast cells from  xxxg2100xxx 
patients and normal individuals using an mrna isolation kit
(boehringer). we performed rt-pcr on mrna using titan one tube rtpcr kit (boehringer) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations
with a pair of primers spanning the entire orf of  xxxg2100xxx  ( xxxg2100xxx -rt;
f2, 5´−cgcgccccggatggatgt−3´; r2, 5´−gctgctgtgaagtca
agaaat−3´; product size 1,628 bp).
expression studies. to determine the transcript size and the expression of
 xxxg2100xxx  in various tissues, we sequentially hybridized a multiple human
tissue mtn northern blot (clontech) with a 498-bp probe derived from
 xxxg2100xxx  exon 2, a 560-bp probe derived from  xxxg2100xxx  exon 3 (overnight
at 55 °c) and a control  xxxg53xxx  probe provided with the mtn blot (1 h at
68 °c). we labelled the probes with alpha32p using random primer labelling
mix (biological industries). we amplified and purified exons 2 and 3 as
part of the sequencing protocol for mutation analysis. following washing
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, we exposed the membranes to biomax ms film (kodak) with transcreen-he intensifying
screens at –80 °c for 24 h ( xxxg2100xxx  probe) and 1 h ( xxxg53xxx  probe).
we further checked the expression of  xxxg2100xxx  in cdnas from retina
(clontech), bone marrow (clontech), fibroblasts and lymphocytes prepared from mrnas isolated as mentioned above. we performed reverse
transcription reactions with amv reverse transcriptase (boehringer) and
then amplified the cdnas with the  xxxg2100xxx -rt primers pair using the
expand high fidelity pcr system (boehringer). we used amplification with
 xxxg53xxx  primers (5´−cattgtgatggactccggagacgg−3´ and 5´−
catctcctgcaagtctagagc−3´) as control. pcr conditions were
chosen according to manufacturer’s recommendations.
protein topology. we used the lalign program (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/lalign-form.html) to perform protein alignments.
this program allows alignments of two sequences finding multiple match1.

ing subsegments. we used the tmpred server (http://www.ch.
embnet.org/software/tmpred_form.html) to predict protein topology.
this program makes a prediction of membrane spanning regions and their
orientation. we then searched for proteins with hydrophobicity profiles
similar to that of  xxxg2100xxx  (http://bioinformatics.weizmann.ac.il/hydroph/
hydroph.html).
mutation and sequence analysis. on the basis of predicted genomic
sequence, we designed the following pcr primer pairs corresponding to
each exon and splicing region of  xxxg2100xxx  (except for primer r1 of exon 1):
exon 1 trma1, 5´−gcgtccgctgtgattggtt−3´ (f1) and 5´–ctccctctcggtcaggtt−3´ (r1), product size 477 bp; exon 2 part 1
trma2a, 5´−agatctttgaggtatttgtagg−3´ and 5´−acacag
gtaagagagatgaca−3´, product size 498 bp; exon 2 part 2 trma2b,
5´−acagccactgaaattgccta−3´ and 5´−agatctaccaagagg
gagttt−3´, product size 493 bp; exon 3 trma3, 5´−ttcgccaga
ggggataaatg−3´ and 5´−cctgctccacttgagtactt−3´, product
size 560 bp; exon 4 trma4, 5´−ccctccataatcttgagctatt−3´ and
5´−ttcctcccatttgcctcattt−3´, product size 440 bp; exon 5
trma5, 5´−gttggaaaggcaattgacagt−3´ and 5´−actttacatctgttccctattg−3´, product size 387 bp; exon 6 trma6, 5´−
ctcaggcagtcaggctttatt−3´ and 5´−gctgctgtgaagtcaagaaat−3´ (r2), product size 434 bp. pcr conditions for genomic amplification were as follows: denaturation at 94 °c for 2 min; 35 subsequent
amplification cycles performed at 94 °c for 30 s, 55 °c for 30 s and 72 °c for
30 s; and a final step at 72 °c for 7 min. we analysed amplified dna fragments by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel and purified them using the
qiaquick gel extraction kit. we then sequenced purified pcr products
using capillary electrophoresis on an abi prism 310 automated sequencer
(perkin elmer) using the big dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (perkin
elmer). we performed mutation analysis in all subjects of the six families.
using direct sequencing of exon 2, we showed that all mutations, including
the missense mutation, are absent in 100 unrelated control individuals, and
thus do not appear to be common polymorphisms. we selected control
individuals from israeli-arab (n=40), israeli jewish−ashkenazi (n=30)
populations and ceph families (n=30).
