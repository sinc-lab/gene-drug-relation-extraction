context: experimental studies in gh-deficient patients and in healthy subjects receiving somatostatin-infusion suggest that gh is an important regulator of substrate metabolism during fasting.
these models may not adequately reflect the selective effects of gh, and  xxxg890xxx  (ghr)
blockade offers a new model to define the metabolic role of gh.
objective: the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of ghr blockade on substrate
metabolism and insulin sensitivity during fasting.
design: we conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 10 healthy young
men.
intervention: after 36 h of fasting with saline or  xxxd2864xxx  (ghr blockade), the subjects were
studied during a 4-h basal period and 2.5-h hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp.
main outcome: we measured whole-body and forearm glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism,
peripheral insulin sensitivity, and acyl and desacyl ghrelin.
results: ghr blockade significantly suppressed circulating free  xxxd2154xxx  (1226 ⫾ 83 vs. 1074 ⫾ 65
␮mol/liter; p ⫽ 0.03) and ketone bodies (3080 ⫾ 271 vs. 2015 ⫾ 235 ␮mol/liter; p ⱕ 0.01), as well as
forearm uptake of free  xxxd2154xxx  (0.341 ⫾ 0.150 vs. 0.004 ⫾ 0.119 ␮mol/100 ml 䡠 min; p ⬍ 0.01) and
lipid oxidation (1.3 ⫾ 0.1 vs. 1.2 ⫾ 0.1 mg/kg 䡠 min; p ⫽ 0.03) in the basal period. by contrast,  xxxg1144xxx 
levels in either serum or peripheral tissues were not impacted by ghr blockade, and protein
metabolism was also unaffected. basal glucose levels were elevated by ghr blockade, but insulin
sensitivity was similar; this was associated with an increased acyl/desacyl ghrelin ratio.
conclusion: ghr blockade, without changes in circulating or tissue  xxxg1144xxx  levels, selectively suppresses lipid mobilization and oxidation after short-term fasting. this supports the notion that
stimulation of lipolysis is a primary and important effect of gh. (j clin endocrinol metab 94:

h is not only essential for promoting longitudinal
growth and somatic maturation in childhood; it is
also an important regulator of substrate metabolism. a
central and early recognized feature of gh is stimulation
of lipolysis and lipid oxidation (1, 2). the lipolytic effect
is causally linked to a concomitant impairment of hepatic
and peripheral insulin sensitivity (3–7). in conditions of
supraphysiological gh levels, clinically significant insulin
resistance and glucose intolerance occurs (8, 9). we have,
however, also observed that the fasting-induced increase
in gh levels, which amplifies lipolysis and also suppresses
peripheral glucose uptake, constitutes a favorable proteinsparing adaptation (10 –12). the data were obtained in
gh-deficient patients studied with and without gh administration and in healthy subjects during a somatostatin
infusion in combination with exogenous gh or saline.
these models have shortcomings. first, it is difficult to
emulate the increase in endogenous gh secretion. second,
gh-deficient patients may have additional pituitary deficits or comorbidity that could impact the effects of gh.
third, infusion of somatostatin together with insulin and
glucagon may modulate the hepatic and peripheral actions
of gh (13–15).
 xxxd2864xxx  is a specific gh antagonist that binds to
the  xxxg890xxx  (ghr) in competition with gh and
blocks ghr signaling (16). in addition to being a licensed
drug in the treatment of acromegaly (17),  xxxd2864xxx 
also provides a potential means to study the isolated actions of gh in healthy subjects.
in the present study, we evaluated the impact of  xxxd2864xxx -mediated gh blockade on substrate metabolism
and insulin sensitivity after 36 h of fasting in healthy subjects. the methods included infusion of isotopes to assess
protein turnover rates, indirect calorimetry to measure
energy expenditure and oxidation rates, assessment of
forearm substrate balances, and measurement of ghrrelated signaling pathways and proteins in muscle and fat
biopsies. in addition, acyl and desacyl ghrelin levels were
measured with a novel and well-validated highly specific
two-site sandwich assay, because it has been reported that
ghrelin levels change with fasting (18) and may directly
influence metabolism (19, 20). the dose of  xxxd2864xxx 
was selected to reduce ghr activation without a major
suppression of  xxxg1144xxx  levels (21).

ten healthy men were studied (age, 24.3 ⫾ 0.6 yr; body mass
index, 23.1 ⫾ 0.4 kg/m2). exclusion criteria included: family
history of type 2 diabetes, use of medications, and alcohol consumption above 252 g ethanol per week.
in this randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study, each subject was examined twice after 36 h of fasting
with the administration of saline and with ghr blockade by
 xxxd2864xxx  (15 mg; pfizer aps, ballerup, denmark). we chose
15 mg of  xxxd2864xxx  (equivalent to 0.20 ⫾ 0.00 mg/kg in our
study population) in an attempt to suppress gh actions without
inducing major changes in  xxxg1144xxx  levels (21).
the study protocol is outlined in fig. 1. the study periods
were separated by a minimum of 6 wk. the subjects were instructed not to deviate from their normal level of activity, to
abstain from alcohol, and to consume a diet complying with the
national recommendations (maximum 30% of the energy from
fat, 50 – 60% from carbohydrates, and 10 –20% from protein)
3 d before each study period. both saline and  xxxd2864xxx  was
injected sc in the abdomen at 2000 h to achieve a peak concentration and effect of ghr blockade during the subsequent metabolic study. during the fasting period, subjects were allowed to
drink tap or mineral water and to perform normal ambulatory
activities, excluding any kind of exercise. at 0700 h (after 35 h
of fasting) the subjects were placed in a quiet, thermoneutral
room. one iv cannula was placed in an antecubital vein for infusion. a second cannula was inserted retrogradely into a deep
antecubital vein for deep venous sampling, and for arterial blood
sampling a third cannula was inserted contralaterally in a dorsal
hand vein and the hand was placed in a 65 c heated box for
arterialization of the blood.

moller et al.

 xxxd2864xxx  suppresses lipolysis during fasting

phenylalanine, tyrosine, and urea flux (qu) was calculated as:
(qu) ⫽ i[ei/ep) ⫺ 1] in which i is the rate of tracer infusion
(␮mol 䡠 kg⫺1 䡠 h⫺1) and ei and ep are enrichment of the tracer
infused and plasma enrichment of the tracer at isotopic plateau,
respectively (22). for calculation of the rate of phenylalanine
conversion to tyrosine and incorporation into protein, the equations of thompson et al. (23) were used. regional phenylalanine
kinetics, e.g. rate of protein synthesis (phenylalanine rate of disappearance) and protein breakdown (phenylalanine rate of appearance), were calculated as described by nair et al. (24) and
copeland and nair (25). phenylalanine balance (phebal) was
calculated as: phebal ⫽ ( xxxd2901xxx  ⫺ phev) ⫻ f, where  xxxd2901xxx  and phev
are phenylalanine concentrations in arteries and veins, and f is
blood flow. urea nitrogen secretion rate (unsr) was estimated
as urinary excretion rate, corrected for accumulation in total
body water and fractional intestinal loss (26).

indirect calorimetry
the respiratory quotient and resting energy expenditure
(ree) were estimated by indirect calorimetry, performed during
the last 30 min of the basal and clamp period. mean values of the
last 25 min were used for calculations. lipid and glucose oxidation were estimated after correction for protein oxidation,
which were calculated on the basis of urea nitrogen excretion
(27). energy production (kilocalories per day) from lipid oxidation was calculated as: [(lipid oxidation ⫻ weight in kilograms)/
1440 min/d] ⫻ 1000 and multiplied by the caloric density (9.1
kcal/g).

forearm metabolism
total forearm blood flow was measured by venous occlusion
plethysmography before each deep venous sample. metabolite
uptake was calculated by multiplying the blood flow and the
arteriovenous metabolite difference. mean metabolite uptake
was estimated over the last 30 min of the basal and clamp period.

biopsies
at t ⫽ 60 min, muscle tissue from musculus vastus lateralis
was obtained by a bergström biopsy needle. the tissue was
cleaned from blood and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. subcutaneous fat tissue from the abdomen was obtained by liposuction
at t ⫽ 240 min; it was cleaned from blood and frozen in liquid
nitrogen.

real time rt-pcr
 xxxg1144xxx  and socs-3 were analyzed as described previously
(28). in short, the biopsies were homogenized using a polytron in
the presence of trizol reagent (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca), and
rna was isolated as described in the manual from invitrogen.
cdna synthesis was performed using the taqman kit n8080234 (perkin-elmer, boston, ma). the pcr was performed using sybr green master mix (applied biosystems, foster city,
ca) with primers as described previously (28). sufficient
amounts of muscle and adipose tissue were available from nine
and 10 subjects, respectively.

determination of adipose tissue and muscle  xxxg1144xxx 
content
 xxxg1144xxx  extraction from adipose tissue and muscle was performed as previously described (29). briefly, 50 mg of tissue was

j clin endocrinol metab, november 2009, 94(11):4524 – 4532

homogenized on ice in 1 m acetic acid (500 ␮l) using a retsch
mixermill 301 (retsch gmbh & co., haan, germany). the
homogenate was extracted twice, and after lyophilization samples were redissolved in 500 ␮l of 40 mm phosphate buffer (ph
8.0). the tissue extracts were kept at ⫺80 c until  xxxg1144xxx  assay was
performed. tissue  xxxg1144xxx  content in the homogenate was determined with a noncompetitive time-resolved immunofluorometric assay (30). sufficient amounts of muscle and adipose tissue
were only available from seven and six subjects, respectively.

hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp
insulin (0.6 mu/kg 䡠 min) (actrapid; novo nordisk a/s,
bagsvaerd, denmark) was infused from t ⫽ 240 to 390 min, and
plasma glucose was clamped at 5 mmol/liter by adjusting the iv
infusion rate of 20% glucose according to plasma glucose measurements every 5–10 min. insulin sensitivity was estimated by
the level of glucose infusion rate and expressed as insulin stimulated glucose uptake (m-value).
two participants only completed the basal period because
they developed a prolonged vasovagal episode in relation to micturition before the clamp.

blood analysis
plasma glucose was measured in duplicate immediately after
sampling on beckman glucoanalyzers (beckman instruments,
palo alto, ca). serum samples were frozen immediately and
stored at ⫺20 c. gh and  xxxd2864xxx  were analyzed as previously described (31). insulin, cortisol, and total  xxxg1144xxx  were analyzed using time-resolved immunofluorometric assays (autodelfia; perkinelmer, wallac, turku, finland). the normal
range (0700 to 0900 h) for plasma cortisol was 201– 681 nmol/
liter. c-peptide was measured by elisa (dakocytomation,
cambridgeshire, uk), and free  xxxd2154xxx  (ffa) were analyzed
by a commercial kit (wako chemicals, neuss, germany). glycerol, acetoacetate, and 3-hydroxybutyrates (3-ohb) were measured using a cobas biocentrifugal analyzer with fluorometric
attachment (roche diagnostics, welwyn garden city, uk).
urea was determined by a commercial method (cobas integra
800, roche, mannheim, germany). glucagon was analyzed using in-house ria.  xxxg1144xxx  bioactivity and igf binding protein 1
( xxxg1148xxx ) were measured at t ⫽ 0 and t ⫽ 390 only;  xxxg1144xxx 
bioactivity was analyzed by a kinase receptor activation assay
(32) and  xxxg1148xxx  by an in-house ria. acyl and desacyl ghrelin
were measured using two well-validated highly sensitive and specific two-site sandwich assays previously described by liu et al.
(18). plasma concentrations of amino acids were determined by
an hplc system (bio-tek kontron, series 525 and 465, fluorescence detector sfm25; kontron instruments, milan, italy).

statistical analysis
student⬘s paired t test or wilcoxon signed rank matched
pairs test was used where appropriate after testing for normal
distribution by kolmogorov-smirnov. skewed data were logtransformed before applying relevant statistical tests and were
presented as medians and ranges. to examine whether measurements changed during the study day, the results obtained at the
placebo day were subtracted from the  xxxd2864xxx  day, and the
difference was tested against the hypothesis of difference ⫽ 0
using univariate anova for repeated measures. if measurements did not change during the basal period, data are presented as means of measurements from t ⫽ 0 min to t ⫽ 240

in the study with ghr blockade, the levels of  xxxd2864xxx  (micrograms per liter) remained constant during
the basal period (883 ⫾ 124, range 520 –1480; anova
p ⫽ 0.32) and were not affected by the clamp (937.8 ⫾
146.2; p ⫽ 0.35) (fig. 1). as shown in table 1, ghr
blockade did not significantly change the serum levels of
gh, total  xxxg1144xxx ,  xxxg1144xxx  bioactivity, or  xxxg1148xxx . although,
at the end of the clamp the levels of  xxxg1144xxx  bioactivity and
 xxxg1148xxx  were slightly lower during ghr blockade compared with placebo, this did not reach statistical significance [ xxxg1144xxx  bioactivity (␮g/liter), 0.18 ⫾ 0.12 (placebo)

as illustrated in fig. 2, ghr blockade elevated the
acyl/desacyl ghrelin ratio in the basal period (p ⫽ 0.05) as

forearm metabolism

a

lipid (fig. 3)
fasting with ghr blockade caused significant suppression of forearm uptake of ffa compared with placebo,
with a mean reduction (␮mol/100 ml/min) of 0.34 ⫾ 0.12
[48 (⫺205 to 864) %] in the basal period and 0.14 ⫾ 0.03
[152 (⫺2264 to 320) %] in the clamp period. forearm
uptake of 3-ohb and glycerol release (data not shown)
were not significantly affected by ghr blockade.

b

fig. 3. whole body circulating levels (a) and forearm uptake (b) of
ffa and 3-ohb after 36 h of fasting with saline (black) and ghr
blockade (white) in the basal period and at the end of a
hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. data are presented as mean ⫾ se.

whole body metabolism
lipid metabolism (fig. 3a)
ghr blockade significantly suppressed circulating
ffa levels compared with placebo, with a mean reduction
(␮mol/l) of 164 ⫾ 68 (11.1 ⫾ 4.6%) in the basal period
and 69 ⫾ 16 (40.1 ⫾ 7.6%) in the clamp period. the levels
of glycerol were comparable [basal, 84.7 ⫾ 4.3 (ghr
blockade) vs. 86.6 ⫾ 5.8 (placebo), p ⫽ 0.73; clamp,
27.1 ⫾ 3.4 vs. 25.4 ⫾ 1.5, p ⫽ 0.65].
ghr blockade in the fasting state significantly suppressed 3-ohb and acetoacetate levels (data not
shown). the impact of the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic
clamp on lipid intermediates, as assessed by ␦ values
(clamp-basal), did not differ between the two studies.

protein and glucose metabolism (table 2)
when comparing ghr blockade and placebo, levels of
amino acids in plasma were similar (data not shown). in
addition, protein turnover (estimated by phenylalanine
and urea flux), protein synthesis (phenylalanine incorporation into protein), amino acid degradation (determined
as the rate of phenylalanine conversion to tyrosine), and
unsr were comparable.
the plasma levels of glucose in the basal period were
significantly higher during fasting with ghr blockade
as compared with placebo (fig. 2), but insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (m value) did not significantly
differ.

protein and glucose (table 2)
forearm muscle exhibited a net release of phenylalanine in both studies, but phenylalanine balance was significantly less negative during ghr blockade as compared with placebo, primarily due to higher arterial levels
of phenylalanine during ghr blockade. however, comparable incorporation of phenylalanine into and breakdown of forearm muscle protein, represented by phenylalanine rate of disappearance and rate of appearance,
respectively, were observed during fasting with ghr
blockade and placebo, and the forearm release of amino
acids was not significantly different (data not shown).
the insulin stimulation during the clamp increased glucose uptake to the same degree in both studies.
indirect calorimetry (fig. 4)
the oxidation rate of lipid was significantly lower during ghr blockade compared with placebo, and so was
ree (kilocalories/day) and energy gain from lipid oxidation (kilocalories/day) with a mean reduction of 108 ⫾ 50
(5.2 ⫾ 2.6%) and 79 ⫾ 27 (12.1 ⫾ 3.9%), respectively, in
the basal period and 99 ⫾ 22 (4.6 ⫾ 1.1%) and 55 ⫾ 46
(3.7 ⫾ 11.3 9%), respectively, in the clamp period. glucose and protein oxidation were comparable in the two
studies (table 2).
biopsies
when comparing biopsies obtained during ghr
blockade and placebo, no significant differences were recorded in socs3 mrna and  xxxg1144xxx  mrna. the tissue
 xxxg1144xxx  content was not significantly reduced with  xxxd2864xxx  (muscle, ghr blockade, 3.0 ⫾ 0.4; saline, 3.8 ⫾ 0.7,
p ⫽ 0.18; adipose tissue, ghr blockade, 0.7 ⫾ 0.1; saline,
0.6 ⫾ 0.1, p ⫽ 0.24).

discussion
gh secretion is amplified during fasting, and experimental data suggest that this may constitute a favorable metabolic adaptation (33). previous studies have primarily
been performed in patients with gh deficiency or in

healthy subjects during suppression of endogenous gh
production with somatostatin (10 –12, 34). we conducted
a randomized, crossover study in healthy subjects during
fasting with isolated and specific blockade of the ghr to
further elucidate the impact of gh. ghr blockade selectively suppressed mobilization and oxidation of lipid intermediates in terms of suppressed levels of circulating
ffa and ketone bodies, decreased forearm ffa uptake,
and reduced oxidation at the whole body level. this effect
of ghr blockade occurred without significant changes in
either glucose or protein metabolism.
the  xxxd2864xxx  dose used in the present study was
selected on the basis of a study conducted by thorner et al.

(21) in order not to completely block gh activity, but
rather to eliminate the metabolic effects of a fasting-induced gh increase. accordingly, we obtained steady-state
levels of  xxxd2864xxx , which were lower than those observed during conventional treatment of acromegaly (31).
in line with previous studies (31, 35), we observed a relatively large interindividual variation in serum  xxxd2864xxx  levels; the mechanism underlying this variation remains uncertain and merits future investigations in a
larger number of subjects.
the mechanism whereby gh promotes mobilization of
lipids is not fully understood, but our finding of reduced
levels of circulating ffa during ghr blockade is in line

 xxxd2864xxx  suppresses lipolysis during fasting

fig. 4. energy metabolism after 36 h of fasting with saline (black)
and ghr blockade (white) in the basal period and at the end of a
hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, as assessed by lipid oxidation and
ree (energy gain from lipid oxidation is illustrated with gray lines; basal
p ⫽ 0.02, clamp p ⫽ 0.28). data are presented as mean ⫾ se.

with a previous report where discontinuation of gh replacement in gh deficiency during fasting was associated
with an attenuated rate of lipolysis (34, 36). in our study,
ghr blockade also caused a lowering of circulating ketone body levels during fasting. ketone body production
is stimulated by glucagon and inhibited by insulin, but
ffa levels per se also seem to be a determinant (12, 37).
in addition, gh has been proposed to stimulate ketogenesis independently of ambient ffa levels (38). both insulin
and glucagon levels were unaffected by ghr blockade in
our study, which supports a direct ketogenic action of
either ffa or gh. likewise, we did not observe an impact
of  xxxd2864xxx  on circulating cortisol levels. it must, however, be emphasized that we only measured the concentrations of ffa and ketone bodies and not the turnover of
these metabolites.
we found reduced ree during fasting with ghr
blockade. gh is known to augment ree, but the mechanism remains uncertain (39). attenuated lipid oxidation
is a well-known feature of fasting without gh (11), and in
our study the reduction in ree caused by ghr blockade
was not only accompanied by decreased lipid oxidation,
but approximately 73% of the reduction in ree could be
explained by reduced energy gain from lipid oxidation. in
agreement with suppressed lipid oxidation, we found decreased forearm uptake of ffa, and forearm ffa uptake
has previously been shown to be related to circulating ffa
levels (6, 40, 41). our present data in relation to gh and
ree do not allow a clear distinction between cause and
effect, but there seems to be a very close link between the
lipolytic and calorigenic effects of gh (6).
we have previously observed that in the postabsorptive
state exogenous gh exposure increases the expression of
socs3 and  xxxg1144xxx  genes in muscle and fat in healthy subjects (42). in the present study, relative ghr blockade did
not affect the expression of these genes during fasting,
although it should be remembered that muscle tissue samples were only obtained from nine subjects. clearly, more

j clin endocrinol metab, november 2009, 94(11):4524 – 4532

studies are needed to delineate the effects of ghr blockade on the expression of target genes.
it has previously been convincingly demonstrated that
the insulin antagonistic effect of gh during fasting is
linked to its lipolytic properties (4 –7). our present observation that ghr blockade did not significantly impact
peripheral insulin sensitivity despite distinct lowering of
ffa levels and uptake in skeletal muscle was therefore
unexpected. the dose of  xxxd2864xxx , and thus the approximately 11% reduction in ffa levels in response to
the ghr blockade may, however, have been too subtle to
impact insulin sensitivity, a suggestion that is supported by
the fact that ffa affects glucose metabolism in a dosedependent manner (41) and that low-dose gh administration apparently does not impact glucose and protein
turnover in healthy obese men despite an approximately
25% increase in lipolysis (43). it should be mentioned that
glucose clamp data were only achieved in eight subjects.
unexpectedly, we observed augmented basal plasma glucose levels during ghr blockade despite unaltered levels
of insulin, cortisol, and glucagon.
the proportion of acyl to desacyl ghrelin has previously
been suggested to determine the overall metabolic response to ghrelin (19, 20), and acyl ghrelin has been demonstrated to increase glucose levels and to reduce insulin
sensitivity (19, 44). therefore, the elevated acyl/desacyl
ratio during ghr blockade, in addition to the positive
correlation between the acyl/desacyl ratio and glucose,
may offer an explanation for the elevation in basal glucose
levels. it is also possible that the elevated ghrelin levels
abrogated the expected increase in insulin sensitivity after
ghr blockade. clearly, more experimental studies are
needed on the impact of fasting on ghrelin acylation and
on the putative direct effects of ghrelin on substrate metabolism and insulin sensitivity to substantiate or refute
our hypothesis.
gh is important for protein preservation during fasting
(11), and these effects are mediated by  xxxg1144xxx  as well as ffa
and ketone body levels. in a study by norrelund et al. (12)
where healthy young men were examined during fasting
with gh administration and concomitant suppression of
lipolysis with acipimox, muscle protein breakdown was
increased by approximately 50% along with a reduction
in ketone bodies and  xxxg1144xxx  levels. however, restoration of
ffa levels did not completely reestablish protein metabolism or ketone body levels. despite significant reduction
in both circulating levels and forearm uptake of ffa, we
found that ghr blockade had no impact on any indices of
whole body or forearm protein metabolism, except for a
less negative forearm phenylalanine balance. our results
are in line with a recent report from sakharova et al. (34)
who reported unaltered proteolysis despite suppressed li-

polysis when gh secretion was blocked in the fasting
state. the lack of effects on protein metabolism in our
study may be explained by several factors. it is possible
that the reduction in ffa was too moderate to influence
protein metabolism and that a higher dose of  xxxd2864xxx 
or a longer observation period would have given a different result. whether ghrelin may affect protein metabolism
remains to be further studied.
in summary, we have demonstrated that administration of  xxxd2864xxx  in the fasting state in a dose that does
not decrease circulating or tissue  xxxg1144xxx  levels selectively
suppresses lipolysis and lipid oxidation without impacting
insulin sensitivity or protein metabolism. this observation
supports the hypothesis that stimulation of lipolysis is a
primary and fundamental effect of gh, as originally predicted by raben and hollenberg (1). the lack of effect of
short-term ghr blockade on insulin sensitivity may suggest that the insulin antagonistic effects of gh require
relatively high gh levels.
