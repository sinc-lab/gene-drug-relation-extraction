abstract: seven forms of congenital long qt syndrome (lqts) caused by mutations in ion channel genes have
been identified. genotype-phenotype correlation in clinical and experimental studies involving arterially-perfused
canine left ventricular wedges suggest that beta-blockers are protective in  xxxg1268xxx , less so in  xxxg1246xxx , but not protective in
 xxxg2028xxx . a class ib sodium channel blocker,  xxxd7xxx   xxxd2635xxx , is most effective in abbreviating qt interval in  xxxg2028xxx , but
effectively reduces transmural dispersion of repolarization (tdr) and prevents the development of torsade de
pointes (tdp) in all 3 models, suggesting its potential as an adjunctive therapy in  xxxg1268xxx  and  xxxg1246xxx . high
concentrations of intravenous nicorandil, a  xxxg1232xxx  opener, have been shown to be capable of decreasing
qt and tdr, and preventing tdp in  xxxg1268xxx  and  xxxg1246xxx  but not in  xxxg2028xxx . the calcium channel blocker,  xxxd3504xxx , has
also been suggested as adjunctive therapy for  xxxg1268xxx ,  xxxg1246xxx  and possibly  xxxg2028xxx .
experimental data using right ventricular wedge preparations suggest that a prominent transient outward current
(ito )-mediated action potential (ap) notch and a loss of ap dome in epicardium, but not in endocardium, give rise
to a transmural voltage gradient, resulting in st segment elevation and the induction of ventricular fibrillation
(vf), characteristics of the brugada syndrome. since the maintenance of the ap dome is determined by the balance
of currents active at the end of phase 1 of the ap, any intervention that reduces the outward current or boosts inward
current at the end of phase 1 may normalize the st segment elevation and suppress vf. such interventions are
candidates for pharmacological therapy of the brugada syndrome. the infusion of  xxxd2401xxx , a beta-adrenergic
stimulant, strongly augments l-type calcium current (i ca-l), and is the first choice for suppressing electrical
storms associated with brugada syndrome. quinidine, by virtue of its actions to block i to, has been proposed as
adjunctive therapy, with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator as backup. oral denopamine, atropine or
 xxxd1698xxx  all increase ica-l, and for this reason may be effective in reducing episodes of vf.

introduction
the past decade has witnessed significant advances in
molecular genetics that have established a link between a
number of inherited cardiac arrhythmias and mutations in
genes encoding for ion channels or other membrane components. most inherited cardiac arrhythmias have been linked
to ion channelopathies giving rise to primary electrical
diseases, including the long qt syndrome [1, 2], brugada
syndrome [3], idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, cardiac
conduction defect (lenegre disease) [4], catecholaminergic
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [5, 6], familial atrial
fibrillation [7], familial sick sinus syndrome [8], familial
wolff-parkinson-white syndrome [9], and short qt
syndrome [10].
seven genotypes have been identified in the congenital
form of the long qt syndrome (lqts). genotype-phenotype
relationships have been delineated in congenital lqts, and
genotype-specific therapies have been proposed based on
experimental and clinical data.

 xxxg2028xxx , the gene encoding for the  xxxg216xxx  of the
sodium channel, is the only gene thus far linked to the
brugada syndrome [3]. recent studies have elucidated the
cellular basis for the brugada syndrome, which is characterized by an st segment elevation in leads v1 – v3 and a
high incidence of ventricular fibrillation (vf), and have
suggested specific therapy based on these cellular mechanisms. our focus in this mini review is on the pharmacologic
approach to therapy of the long qt and brugada syndromes
with an assessment of the potential for gene-specific therapy.
long qt syndrome
congenital lqts is characterized by qt prolongation in
the electrocardiogram (ecg) and polymorphic ventricular
tachycardia known as torsade de pointes (tdp), which often
leads to syncope and sudden cardiac death [11-14]. physical
exercise and emotional states often precipitate syncope and/or
sudden cardiac death in patients with congenital lqts [1115]. accordingly, beta-blockers are indicated for prevention of
cardiac events in lqts patients [16]. however, cardiac
events occasionally appear at rest or during sleep without
arousal, in which case beta-blockers are usually ineffective [16].
recent molecular genetic studies have provided an
understanding of the basis for these phenotypic distinctions.

seven forms of congenital lqts have been identified due to
mutations in genes encoding for potassium and sodium
channels or membrane components located on chromosomes
3, 4, 7, 11, 17 and 21 [17-19]. mutations in  xxxg1268xxx  and
 xxxg1245xxx , alpha and beta subunits of the  xxxg1232xxx  gene,
respectively, are responsible for defects in the slowly
activating component of the delayed rectifier potassium
current (iks) underlying the  xxxg1268xxx  and  xxxg1245xxx  forms of
lqts [20, 21]. similarly, mutations in  xxxg1246xxx  and
kcne2 cause defects in the rapidly activating component of
the delayed rectifier potassium current (ikr) responsible for
the  xxxg1246xxx  and lqt6 forms [22, 23]. mutations in  xxxg2028xxx ,
the gene that encodes the  xxxg216xxx  of the sodium channel,
result in an increase in the late sodium current (ina)
responsible for  xxxg2028xxx  [24]. recently, mutations in kcnj2,
which encodes for the inward rectifier potassium current
(ik1), were shown to cause qt prolongation, periodic
paralysis and dysmorphic features underlying andersen’s
syndrome (lqt7) [18]. moreover, a mutation in ankyrin-b,
a member of a family of versatile membrane adapters, was
recently reported to result in the intracellular ca2+ overload,
underlying lqt4 syndrome [19]. it is noteworthy that
causative mutations can be identified in 60 - 70 % of
clinically affected lqts probands. congenital lqts is
responsible for at least a part of the cases of sudden infant
death syndrome (sids) [25], some of which possess  xxxg2028xxx 
mutations [26, 27].
genotype-phenotype correlation can contribute to optimal
management and genotype-specific approach to therapy of
patients with lqts [28-30]. since  xxxg1268xxx ,  xxxg1246xxx  and  xxxg2028xxx 
syndromes comprise more than 90 % of genotyped patients
[17], genotype-phenotype data are most abundant for these
syndromes.
genotype-specific clinical characteristics
moss and co-workers identified genotype-specific t wave
morphologies in the ecg. broad-based prolonged t waves
were found most frequently in  xxxg1268xxx  syndrome, low-amplitude t waves with a notched or bifurcated configuration in
 xxxg1246xxx  syndrome, and late-appearing t waves with a long
isoelectric st-segment in  xxxg2028xxx  syndrome [31]. the
genotype-specific t wave pattern in a resting ecg in the
 xxxg1268xxx ,  xxxg1246xxx  and  xxxg2028xxx  forms was further evaluated by
zhang et al., and numerous exceptions were reported for all
3 genotypes [32]. to overcome this, takenaka et al. reported
that exercise treadmill testing could unmask the characteristic t wave patterns in  xxxg1268xxx  (broad-based t waves) and
 xxxg1246xxx  (notched t waves) patients [33]. a characteristic t
wave pattern has not been reported in  xxxg1245xxx  and lqt6
syndromes. tu abnormalities such as biphasic t waves
following long pauses have been reported in lqt4 and
lqt7 syndromes [18, 19].
experimental models of lqts involving the arteriallyperfused canine left ventricular wedge preparations have
delineated the cellular basis for t wave patterns characteristic
of  xxxg1268xxx ,  xxxg1246xxx  and  xxxg2028xxx  syndromes [34-42]. chromanol
293b, a specific i ks blocker, was used to mimic  xxxg1268xxx 
syndrome [35, 40-42], whereas d-sotalol, an ikr blocker, in
the presence of hypokalemia was used to simulate  xxxg1246xxx 
syndrome [34, 36, 40-42]. atx-ii was used to augment late

shimizu et al.

ina, mimicking  xxxg2028xxx  syndrome [34, 39-42]. in all 3
models, differences in the time course of ventricular
repolarization of the epicardial, mid-myocardial (m) and
endocardial cells create voltage gradients across the
ventricular wall responsible for the specific t wave patterns.
genotype-specific response to sympathetic stimulation
genotype-specific triggers of cardiac events were also
reported for  xxxg1268xxx ,  xxxg1246xxx  and  xxxg2028xxx  syndromes [29, 43-45],
and these are probably due to the genotype-specific response
of repolarization to sympathetic stimulation. in  xxxg1268xxx 
syndrome, cardiac events are more frequently observed
during exercise (62 %) than in  xxxg1246xxx  (13 %) or  xxxg2028xxx  (13 %)
syndromes [29] swimming is a specific trigger of  xxxg1268xxx 
syndrome [45]. in  xxxg1246xxx  syndrome, cardiac events can also
occur during exercise (13 %) or during sleep/rest (15 %) [29].
often, a sudden startle in the form of an auditory stimulus
(telephone ring, alarm clock, ambulance siren, etc.) is a
specific trigger of  xxxg1246xxx  syndrome [43, 44]. cardiac events
are more frequently observed during postpartum periods in
 xxxg1246xxx  syndrome than in  xxxg1268xxx  syndrome [46]. in contrast,
cardiac events occur principally during sleep/rest (39 %) in
 xxxg2028xxx  syndrome, and exercise-related cardiac events are rare
(13 %) [29].
clinical studies by our group and others suggest that
sympathetic stimulation with epinephrine infusion or
exercise testing produces genotype-specific responses of the
qt interval [33, 47-52]. the corrected qt (qtc) interval is
prolonged at peak epinephrine effect when the heart rate is
maximally increased, and remains prolonged at steady state
epinephrine effect in  xxxg1268xxx  patients [48, 52]. the qtc
interval is also prolonged at peak epinephrine effect in  xxxg1246xxx 
patients, but returns to close to baseline levels at steady state
epinephrine effect [48]. in contrast, qtc is less prolonged at
peak epinephrine effect in  xxxg2028xxx  patients than in either  xxxg1268xxx 
or  xxxg1246xxx  patients, and is abbreviated below baseline levels at
steady state epinephrine effect [48].
our experimental data using arterially-perfused wedge
preparations also suggest a genotype-specific response of the
action potential duration (apd) and transmural dispersion of
repolarization (tdr) to beta-adrenergic stimulation in the 3
lqts models [35, 41, 50]. in the  xxxg1268xxx  model, beta-adrenergic
stimulation prolongs the qt interval and the apd of m
cells but abbreviates those of epicardial and endocardial cells,
resulting in a persistent increase in the qt interval and the
tdr (fig. 1a) [41]. in the  xxxg1246xxx  model,  xxxd2401xxx 
initially prolongs and then abbreviates the qt interval and
the apd of m cells to the control level, whereas the apd of
epicardial and endocardial cells is always abbreviated,
leading to a transient increase in the qt interval and the
tdr (fig. 1b) [41]. in the  xxxg2028xxx  model,  xxxd2401xxx 
produces a persistent abbreviation of the qt interval and the
apd of the 3 cell types, resulting in a persistent decrease
of the qt interval and tdr (fig. 1c) [41]. the persistent
increase in the qt interval and the tdr during beta-adrenergic
stimulation may create an arrhythmogenic substrate, and is
consistent with the greater sensitivity of  xxxg1268xxx  patients to
sympathetic stimulation. the transient increase of the qt
interval and tdr following increased sympathetic activity is
consistent with the nature of tdp, which is often observed

fig. (1). differential effect of  xxxd2401xxx  (iso), a beta-agonist, on the qt interval and the action potential duration (apd) in the  xxxg1268xxx ,
 xxxg1246xxx  and  xxxg2028xxx  models of the arterially-perfused canine left ventricular wedge preparations. shown are superimposed action
potentials recorded simultaneously from m and epicardial (epi) cells together with a transmural ecg at a bcl of 2000 msec. in the
 xxxg1268xxx  model with chromanol 293b, iso dramatically prolongs the apd of the m cells (2 minutes) and maintains this as the effect
approaches a steady state (10 minutes), whereas the apd of the epi cells is always abbreviated, resulting in a persistent increase in
the qt interval and the transmural dispersion of repolarization (tdr) (a). in the  xxxg1246xxx  model with d-sotalol, iso initially prolongs (2
minutes) and then abbreviates the apd of the m cells to the control level (10 minutes), whereas the apd of the epi cells is always
abbreviated, resulting in a transient increase in the qt interval and the tdr (b). in the  xxxg2028xxx  model with atx-ii, iso always
abbreviates the apd of both cells, resulting in a persistent decrease in the qt interval and the tdr (c). modified from [41] with
permission.

following a startle. the persistent decrease of the qt
interval and tdr during beta-adrenergic stimulation in the
 xxxg2028xxx  model explains why cardiac events occur more
frequently during sleep/rest when sympathetic tone is low in
 xxxg2028xxx  patients.
genotype-specific therapy
preliminary clinical studies indicate the possibility for
genotype-specific therapy based on abbreviations of the qt
interval by agents or other interventions in congenital lqts
[29, 53]. however, the ability to abbreviate the qt interval
does not necessarily determine the effectiveness of an
intervention to reduce arrhythmic risk or sudden cardiac
death. our experimental studies employing pharmacological
models of lqts in arterially-perfused wedge preparations
have provided a quantitative assessment of genotype-specific
therapies for congenital forms of lqts (table 1) [34-42].
table 1.

1. beta- blockers
a beta-blocker is the first choice of therapy in patients with
congenital lqts, when the genotype cannot be identified
[16]. the international registry of lqts reported that betablockers reduce the incidence of syncope and sudden cardiac
death in patients with congenital lqts, especially in  xxxg1268xxx 
patients (80 %) [29]. beta-blockers are less effective in  xxxg1246xxx 
and  xxxg2028xxx  patients. data from wedge studies suggest that,
propranolol, a beta-blocker, completely suppresses the effect of
 xxxd2401xxx  to persistently increase tdr and to induce tdp
in the  xxxg1268xxx  model [35, 41]. in the  xxxg1246xxx  model,
propranolol also totally prevents the transient effect of
 xxxd2401xxx  to increase tdr and to induce tdp [41],
indicating that moderate effectiveness of beta-blockers in  xxxg1246xxx 
syndrome. however,  xxxg1246xxx  models can develop tdp in the
absence of  xxxd2401xxx  unlike  xxxg1268xxx , explaining why beta
blockade is not as protective in  xxxg1246xxx  as it is in  xxxg1268xxx . in

 xxxg2028xxx  models, sympathetic stimulation with  xxxd2401xxx 
persistently decreases tdr and suppresses tdp [41].
propranolol antagonizes these protective effects of
 xxxd2401xxx , suggesting that beta-blockers are not protective in
 xxxg2028xxx  patients.
2. sodium channel blockers
schwartz et al. initially reported that  xxxd7xxx   xxxd2635xxx , a class
ib sodium channel blocker that blocks late ina, abbreviates
the qt interval in  xxxg2028xxx  patients more effectively than in
 xxxg1246xxx  patients [53]. however, qt shortening by class ib
drugs does not reflect their efficacy in reducing arrhythmic
risk. experimental data from wedge studies indicates that
 xxxd7xxx   xxxd2635xxx  is more effective in abbreviating the qt interval
in the  xxxg2028xxx  model than in the  xxxg1268xxx  or  xxxg1246xxx  model (fig.
2) [34, 35], but that the drug reduces tdr and suppresses
the development of tdp equally in the  xxxg1268xxx ,  xxxg1246xxx  and
 xxxg2028xxx  models (fig. 2) [34, 35]. this effect of  xxxd7xxx   xxxd2635xxx  to
reduce tdr in all three models is attributable to the
intrinsically larger late ina in m cells than in epicardial or
endocardial cells [54]. block of late ina by  xxxd7xxx   xxxd2635xxx  limits
the ability of qt prolonging forces to increase the apd of
the m cell. our data suggest that  xxxd7xxx   xxxd2635xxx , a class ib
sodium channel blocker, may be given consideration as first
line therapy in  xxxg2028xxx  patients. however, because of a lack of
prospective clinical trials mainly due to small number of
 xxxg2028xxx  patients,  xxxd7xxx   xxxd2635xxx  should be used at the moment in
the presence of beta-blockers or under the backup of an
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (icd) even in  xxxg2028xxx 
patients.
a class ic sodium channel blocker,  xxxd2113xxx , is reported
to be effective in abbreviating qt interval in  xxxg2028xxx  patients
with a specific mutation (d1790g) in  xxxg2028xxx  [55].

shimizu et al.

however, class ic sodium channel blockers might elicit a
brugada phenotype in  xxxg2028xxx  patients [56], therefore should
not be used in general in  xxxg2028xxx  syndrome except for that
with the specific  xxxg2028xxx  mutation.
3. potassium supplement
compton and co-workers demonstrated that exogenously
administered potassium corrects repolarization abnormalities
in  xxxg1246xxx  patients with ikr defects [57]. more recently, longterm oral potassium administration was reported to improve
repolarization abnormalities in  xxxg1246xxx  patients [58]. acute
intravenous treatment with potassium is especially effective
in suppressing tdp. experimental data from the wedge have
also shown that an increase in extracellular potassium can
limit the development of an arrhythmogenic substrate under
long qt conditions, due principally to its action to increase
ikr and ik1 and limit the potency of ikr blockers [36].
4.  xxxg1232xxx  openers
our previous clinical study using monophasic action
potential (map) recordings showed that intravenous
administration of nicorandil, a  xxxg1232xxx  opener,
reduces epinephrine-induced prolongation of the qt interval
and map duration in  xxxg1268xxx  patients with iks defects [59].
nicorandil was also shown to suppress epinephrine-induced
early afterdepolarizations (eads) [59]. experimental data
from wedge studies suggest that nicorandil (2 - 20 µmol/l)
abbreviates qt interval and apd of the 3 cell types in the 3
models [42]. high concentrations (10 - 20 µmol/l) completely reverse the effects of chromanol 293b+ xxxd2401xxx 
and those of d-sotalol to increase apd and tdr, and to
induce tdp in the  xxxg1268xxx  and  xxxg1246xxx  models [42]. in contrast,
20 µmol/l nicorandil reverses only 50% of the effect of
atx-ii and fails to completely suppress tdp in the  xxxg2028xxx 

fig. (2). dose-dependent effects of  xxxd7xxx   xxxd2635xxx  (mex) on action potential duration (apd) and qt interval in the chromanol

wedge preparations. each trace shows superimposed action potentials recorded simultaneously from m and epicardial (epi) regions,
together with a transmural ecg. bcl=2000 msec.  xxxd7xxx   xxxd2635xxx  (2 to 20 µmol/l) dose-dependently abbreviates the apd of both cells as
well as the qt interval; 20 µmol/l  xxxd7xxx   xxxd2635xxx  completely reverses the effect of atx-ii to prolong the qt interval, apd and to increase
the transmural dispersion of repolarization (tdr) in the  xxxg2028xxx  model (c). although 20 µmol/l  xxxd7xxx   xxxd2635xxx  does not reverses the effect
of the drugs to prolong the qt interval and apd in the  xxxg1268xxx  (a) and  xxxg1246xxx  (b) models, the effect of  xxxd7xxx   xxxd2635xxx  to abbreviate the apd
is clearly greater in the m cell than in the epi cell.  xxxd7xxx   xxxd2635xxx  thus decreases tdr. modified from [34, 35] with permission.

specific therapy in inherited arrhythmias

model [42]. our data suggest that  xxxg1232xxx  openers
may be effective when lqts is secondary to reduced iks
( xxxg1268xxx ) or ikr ( xxxg1246xxx ) but not when it is due to augmented
late i na ( xxxg2028xxx ). oral dosing of nicorandil leads to blood
levels in the range of 0.2 to 0.3 µmol/l, whereas intravenous injection can raise plasma levels to 4 µmol/l. therefore, intravenously but not orally administered nicorandil
may be of therapeutic value in suppressing repetitive episodes of tdp in patients with  xxxg1268xxx  and  xxxg1246xxx  syndromes,
but less so in those with  xxxg2028xxx .
5. calcium channel blockers
our previous clinical studies involving map recordings
indicated that  xxxd3504xxx , a blocker of l-type calcium current
(ica-l), is effective in abbreviating the qt interval and
map duration as well as abolishing epinephrine-induced
eads in patients with congenital lqts [60]. thereafter,
most of our lqts patients in the study were shown to be
linked to  xxxg1268xxx  or  xxxg1246xxx  syndrome. our recent experimental
data employing the wedge preparations also demonstrated
that  xxxd3504xxx  effectively decreases the qt interval and tdr
and suppresses eads and tdp in a combination of
congenital and acquired lqts ( xxxg1268xxx  +  xxxg1246xxx ) (fig. 3)

current pharmaceutical design, 2005, vol. 11, no. 12 1565

[61]. although data of the effect of  xxxd3504xxx  in the  xxxg2028xxx 
model is still lacking, calcium channel blockers may be
useful for adjunctive therapy in  xxxg1268xxx ,  xxxg1246xxx  (fig. 4) and
probably  xxxg2028xxx  patients. it is noteworthy that  xxxd3504xxx ,
like many other calcium channel blockers, is also a potent
inhibitor of late i na.
6. pacemaker therapy
an increase of heart rate with exercise abbreviates the qt
interval more effectively in  xxxg2028xxx  patients than in  xxxg1246xxx 
patients [53]. our previous map studies demonstrated that
atrial pacing without sympathetic stimulation shortens the
qt interval and map duration more significantly in patients
with lqts than in control patients [62]. our experimental
data from the wedges showed that the apd-, qt- and tdrrate relations are much steeper in the  xxxg2028xxx  model than in
the  xxxg1268xxx  or  xxxg1246xxx  model, possibly due to slow kinetics of
reactivation of late ina [34, 35]. however, the apd-rate
relations in the 3 models are all steeper than under baseline
conditions, suggesting that pacemaker therapy may also be
useful in  xxxg1268xxx  and  xxxg1246xxx  patients, although it is likely to
be most effective in  xxxg2028xxx  patients.

m regions together with a transmural ecg using the arterially-perfused feline left ventricular wedge preparations (bcl=2000 msec.).
 xxxd3504xxx  (0.1 to 5 µmol/l) dose-dependently abbreviates apd of the epi and m regions as well as the qt interval.  xxxd3504xxx 
preferentially abbreviates the epi apd compared to the apd of the m region, thus normalizing the inverted t wave and decreasing
transmural dispersion of repolarization to control levels.

the 12-lead ecg shows low-amplitude t waves with a notched configuration in leads i, ii, iii, avf, v4, v5 and v6, consistent with the
t wave pattern in  xxxg1246xxx  syndrome.

brugada syndrome
in 1992, pedro and josep brugada described 8 patients
with a history of aborted sudden cardiac death due to vf and
a distinct ecg pattern, consisting of right bundle branch
block (rbbb) and st segment elevation in the right
precordial leads (v1 - v3) in the absence of any structural
heart disease [63-72]. brugada syndrome is more commonly
observed in asian countries, including thailand and japan
than in the u.s. and european countries [73-75]. in 1998,
chen and co-workers reported the first and only gene
mutation linked to brugada syndrome in  xxxg2028xxx , which
encodes for the  xxxg216xxx  of the cardiac sodium channel [3].
the  xxxg2028xxx  mutations causing brugada phenotype generally
result in a reduction in the availability of ina (loss of
function). more than five dozen distinct mutations in
 xxxg2028xxx  gene have been so far identified, and all mutations
display an autosomal dominant mode of transmission. thus,
males and females are expected to inherit the defective gene
equally. however, more than 80% of brugada probands are
adult males. two specific types of st segment elevation are
observed in patients with this syndrome; coved and saddleback type st segment elevation. although the magnitude
and pattern of st segment elevation is dynamic, waxing and
waning day-to-day [76], the coved type st segment
elevation is of importance in relation to a higher incidence of
vf and sudden cardiac death [69-72, 77].
cellular mechanism for brugada phenotype
a transient outward current (ito)-mediated phase 1 notch
of the action potential (ap) is reported to be greater in the

epicardium than in the endocardium in many species between the late 1980s and early 1990s [78-82]. antzelevitch’s
group used the canine right ventricle and suggested that the
prominent ito-mediated phase 1 ap notch and subsequent
loss of the ap dome (all-or-none repolarization) in the
epicardium but not in the endocardium contribute to a
significant voltage gradient transmurally during ventricular
activation [78, 79]. moreover, they demonstrated that
heterogeneous loss of the ap dome in the epicardium
produces a premature beat via a mechanism of phase 2
reentry in isolated sheets of canine right ventricle [83].
around the same time , brugada syndrome was reported as a
specific clinical entity, which seemed to be a clinical
counterpart to the mechanism of all-or-none repolarization
and phase 2 reentry [63].
direct experimental evidence for the cellular mechanism
of st segment elevation and vf in brugada syndrome was
obtained by the same group using an arterially-perfused
canine right ventricular wedge preparation [84, 85]. their
data showed that the ito-mediated ap notch and the loss of
ap dome in the epicardium, but not endocardium of the
right ventricular outflow tract, gives rise to a transmural
voltage gradient. this results in st segment elevation in
leads v1 - v3 and the induction of vf due to phase 2 reentry
[85]. j point elevation or saddleback-type st segment
elevation is created by the transmural voltage gradient due to
a large phase 1 notch in the epicardium but not in the
endocardium (fig. 5b). the coved-type st segment elevation and the terminal negative t wave, which are more
malignant signs, are secondary to further accentuated phase 1
notch, greater prolongation of epicardial apd, and a

specific therapy in inherited arrhythmias

resultant reversed transmural voltage gradient (fig. 5c).
loss of the ap dome in the epicardium further accentuates
st segment elevation (fig. 5d). a variety of agents including antiarrhythmic and autonomic agents modulate st
segment elevation and the prevalence of vf in right
ventricular wedge preparations. exposure to pinacidil, a
 xxxg1232xxx  opener, produces a transmural voltage
gradient between epicardial and endocardial cells and st
segment elevation in the transmural ecg. a combination
with pilsicainide, a class ic sodium channel blocker and
terfenadine, an ica-l blocker, also induces a transmural
voltage gradient, coved-type st segment elevation, and the
terminal negative t wave in the ecg (fig. 5c). as an
autonomic agent, acetylcholine, a parasympathetic agonist,
also induces st segment elevation probably due to its
blocking effect of ica-l. in contrast,  xxxd2401xxx , a betaadrenergic agonist, strongly augments ica-l, restores the
epicardial dome and attenuates st segment elevation (fig.
5e). the relatively selective ito blocker,  xxxd1804xxx  (4ap), and the less selective ito blocker, quinidine, also
restore the epicardial dome and decrease the phase 1 ap
notch, thus decreasing or eliminating st segment elevation
(fig. 6). in right ventricular wedge preparations, heterogeneous loss of the ap dome in the epicardium results in a
marked epicardial dispersion of repolarization (edr) (fig.

current pharmaceutical design, 2005, vol. 11, no. 12 1567

6b and 7a), giving rise to a premature beat due to phase 2
reentry, which then precipitates vf (fig. 7b and 7c). the
episodes of vf induced in this model are also successfully
suppressed by ito blockade with  xxxd1804xxx  or quinidine.
specific therapy based on cellular mechanisms
since the maintenance of the ap dome is determined by
the balance of currents active at the end of phase 1 of ap
(principally ito and i ca-l), any interventions that increase
outward currents (e.g. ito, adenosine tri-phosphate sensitive
potassium current [ik-atp], i ks, i kr) or decrease inward
currents (e.g. ica-l, fast i na) at the end of phase 1 can
accentuate st segment elevation, as found in brugada
patients. among these interventions, st segment elevation
is unmasked or amplified most by class ic sodium channel
blockers secondary to their strong effect to block fast ina.
therefore, class ic sodium channel blockers are used as a
diagnostic tool to unmask latent brugada syndrome with
transient or non-spontaneous st segment elevation [86-89].
in addition to sodium channel blockers, considerable drugs
and conditions that cause an outward shift in current active at
the end of phase 1 ap are reported to induce transient st
segment elevation like that in brugada syndrome, which is
described as an “acquired” form of brugada syndrome [90].

µmol/l) produces further accentuation of phase 1 notch, a greater prolongation of epi ap, and a reversed transmural voltage gradient,
giving rise to coved-type st segment elevation with a terminal negative t wave. d: further accentuation of phase 1 notch in epi ap
causes loss of ap dome, thus further accentuates st-segment elevation in the ecg. e:  xxxd2401xxx  (0.02 µg/min) restores ap dome
in epi and attenuates the st segment elevation.

phase 1 ap notch in epi but not in endo is associated with a j wave in the ecg. b: a combination of pinacidil (2 µmol/l), terfenadine
(5 µmol/l), and pilsicainide (5 µmol/l) produces a loss of ap dome in epi 1 but not in epi 2, results in a marked epicardial dispersion
of repolarization (edr), and a coved-type st segment elevation and a negative t wave in the ecg. c:  xxxd1804xxx  (2 µmol/l) restores the ap
dome, decreases the phase 1 ap notch, and normalizes the st-segment elevation.

simultaneously from one endocardial (endo) and 2 epicardial (epi 1 and epi 2) sites together with a transmural ecg (bcl=2000
msec). a combined administration of pinacidil (2 µmol/l), terfenadine (5 µmol/l), and pilsicainide (5 µmol/l) causes heterogeneous
loss of ap dome in epi, giving rise to coved-type st-segment elevation and increasing epicardial dispersion of repolarization (edr)
(a). electrotonic propagation from the site where the dome is restored (epi 1) to the site where it is lost (epi 2) develops pvc due to a
mechanism of phase 2 reentry (b), which triggered a spontaneous polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (c).

specific therapy in inherited arrhythmias

these include calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, firstgeneration histaminic  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists, and
psychotropic drugs including tricyclic antidepressants,
phenothiazine, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
on the other hand, agents that reduce outward currents
(e.g. ito, i k-atp, i ks, i kr) or boost inward currents (e.g.
ica-l) at the end of phase 1 of ap can attenuate st segment
elevation and suppress episodes of vt/vf. such agents are
candidates for a pharmacological approach to therapy of the
brugada syndrome (table 2). based on current data, an icd
should be implanted in brugada patients with a history of
cardiac arrest/aborted sudden cardiac death or syncope
(symptomatic brugada syndrome), because of a high
recurrence rate of cardiac events during follow-up periods
after the first cardiac event [64, 69, 71, 72, 91]. the
indication of icd is still controversial in patients with
asymptomatic brugada syndrome who have no history of

current pharmaceutical design, 2005, vol. 11, no. 12 1569

cardiac arrest/aborted sudden cardiac death and syncope [69,
71]. only under backup with icd therapy, should adjunctive
pharmacological treatment be considered in symptomatic
brugada patients to reduce the incidence of vf episodes.
quinidine is the only oral antiarrhythmic agents which may
be of therapeutic value [92, 93]. although quinidine is
classified as a ia sodium channel blocker, it improves st
segment elevation as a result of its relatively strong ito
blocking effect [94]. denopamine, an oral adrenergic stimulant, or oral atropine, an anti-cholinergic agent, increases
ica-l, and may be a choice for pharmaceutical therapy [95].
more recently,  xxxd1698xxx , a  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor,
was reported to reduce st segment elevation probably due to
its effect to increase ica-l and heart rate [96]. during
electrical storm associated with repetitive episodes of vf,
continuous infusion of  xxxd2401xxx , a beta-adrenergic agonist
(0.005 - 0.02 µg/kg/min or 20 % increase of heart rate), is
the first choice of therapy (fig. 8) [97]. injections of atropine

brugada syndrome. a: the 12-lead ecg at baseline shows coved-type st segment or prominent j wave in leads v1 and v2. b:
spontaneous vf is recorded by holter monitoring. c: continuous infusion of  xxxd2401xxx  (0.004 µg/kg/min) attenuates the
amplitude of st segment elevation and j wave, and totally suppresses vf.

1570 current pharmaceutical design, 2005, vol. 11, no. 12

shimizu et al.

may be another choice, although the effect is short-lived.
based on the cellular mechanism responsible for brugada
phenotype, a cardio-selective ito blocker would be an ideal
pharmaceutical approach, and the development of such a drug
will be most welcome [98].
