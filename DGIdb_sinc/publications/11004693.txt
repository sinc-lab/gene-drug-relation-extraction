relationship between expression of  xxxg2312xxx  isoforms and chemosensitivity in choroidal melanoma.  choroidal melanoma has a high mortality rate and responds poorly to existing chemotherapy, but unexpected ex vivo sensitivity of a subset of these tumours to  xxxg2312xxx  inhibitors has been noted. since chemoresistance may be mediated by the molecular phenotype of tumours, immunohistochemistry has been used to study the expression of both isoforms of  xxxg2312xxx  (alpha and beta) in 29 choroidal melanomas for which chemosensitivity assay data for doxorubicin or mitoxantrone are also available. of these, eight tumours were  xxxg2312xxx -positive and 11 were  xxxg2312xxx  alpha-positive. recent studies showing genetic abnormality (often monosomy of chromosome 3) in choroidal melanoma suggest that loss of immunostaining could be due to genomic loss rather than down-regulation of  xxxg2312xxx  in these tumours. there was no convincing excess of anthracycline resistance in the  xxxg2312xxx -negative group. addition of  xxxg2312xxx  alpha,  xxxg10xxx  (11/17 positive), lrp (16/28 positive), and mrp (5/29 positive) data in multivariate analysis did not reliably predict sensitivity or resistance. vincristine chemosensitivity showed no relation to  xxxg10xxx , lrp or mrp in 18 tumours tested. while it is possible that some tumours which do express  xxxg2312xxx  may respond to anthracyclines, the molecular basis of resistance or sensitivity to anthracyclines or vincristine in uveal melanoma is complex and remains incompletely understood.
