introduction
various antidepressant drugs have been developed, and their antidepressive effects have been observed in animal models. the results of
such experiments, however, have not yet yielded sufficient data to
be useful in the clinical setting. the tricyclic antidepressant drugs
have heretofore been considered effective in the treatment of depression because they inhibit the active uptake of amines into the
presynaptic cells of the brain (coppen, 1972; prange et al., 1974).
this action, however, cannot be reconciled with the time course of
the clinical effects of these drugs; uptake is inhibited within minutes, while clinical effects are not apparent for at least 2 weeks.
many reports (fuxe et al., 1979; bergstrom and kellar, 1979; peroutka and snyder, 1980) suggest that the changes in responsiveness
of postsynaptic neurons to amines following long-term treatment
with tricyclic antidepressant drugs is due, at least in part, to an alteration in the number and affinity of binding sites for amine.
convincing evidence for the existence of at least two forms of
 xxxg1357xxx  (mao), named mao-a and mao-b, was
first obtained by johnston (1968). m a o - a preferentially deaminares 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht), whereas mao-b deaminates
[3-phenylethylamine ([3-pea) (neff and yang, 1974). in addition,
several reports (egashira et al., 1982, 1987; egashira and yamanaka,
1987) have documented that mao-a and mao-b kinetics vary
with the administration of certain drugs, but not with the antidepressant drugs or the mao inhibitors. it has also been demonstrated
(roth and gillis, 1974b; edwards and bums, 1974) that tricyclic

antidepressant drugs inhibit mao, particularly mao-b in vitro, and
may in this way be important in the long-term use of these drugs,
in vivo.

the present study was conducted to determine whether or not
other cyclic antidepressants, such as the dicyclic drugs  xxxd3555xxx 
and viloxazine; the tricyclic drugs imipramine, amitriptyline, and
nortriptyline; the tetracyclic drug maprotiline; and the noncyclic
drug  xxxd2746xxx , inhibit mao activity in mouse brain both in vivo
and in vitro. we also described changes in mao kinetics in the
brains of mice by measuring the influences of these drugs on enzymatic parameters during repeated administration of drugs.

materials and methods
drugs

the following drugs, donated by the manufacturers, were used in the
study:  xxxd3555xxx  hydrochloride (fujisawa, osaka, japan), viloxazine
hydrochloride (imperial chemical industries plc, cheshire, uk),
imipramine and maprotiline hydrochloride (ciba-geigy, takarazuka, japan), amitriptyline hydrochloride (yamanouchi, tokyo, japan), nortriptyline hydrochloride (dinippon, osaka, japan), and
 xxxd2746xxx  maleate ( hoechst, frankfurt, germany). all other
chemicals were obtained from wako pure chemical industries
(osaka, japan). the two radiochemical substrates used in this study,
hydroxytryptamine binoxalate (5-[2-14c]-5-ht; 1.48 to 2.22 gbq/
mmol) and phenylethylamine hydrochloride ([3-[ethyl-l-14c]-[3pea; 1.48 to 2.22 gbq/mmol), were purchased from dupont nen

administration of
antidepressants and enzyme preparation
a total of 80 male mice (ddy-strain, 25 to 30 g, seiwa jikken doubutsu, yoshitomi, fukuoka, japan) were used. the mice were housed
in temperature-controlled animal quarters, and kept on a circadian
cycle of 12 h light and 12 h dark. the animals were allowed constant access to food and water. each group of mice (n= 10) received
intraperitoneal injections of one of seven types of antidepressant
drugs (30 mg/kg, dissolved in saline solution) once daily for 4 weeks.
control mice were given a vehicle only. the dose for each drug was
determined from a review of data regarding the effects of antidepressant drugs in animal models. the mice were killed by decapitation
24 h after the last dose, and their brains were quickly removed and
homogenized in 10 volumes of 0.32 m sucrose solution (previously
adjusted to ph 7.4 with 0.5 m nahco3). the mitochondrial fractions were prepared by differential centrifugation (egashira and yamanaka, 1993). the mitochondria were washed twice by resuspension in 0.32 m sucrose solution and were used as the enzyme
preparations. all operations were carried out at 4°c.

assay of m a o activity
in vivo: the m a o activity was measured using the labeled substrates [14c]-5-ht and [14c]-[3-pea, as described previously (egashira and yamanaka, 1993). the incubation medium contained a suitable amount of the enzyme preparation (50 tlg) , and was left to
stand for at least 40 rain in a total volume of 225 ixl of phosphate
buffer, ph 7.4. the reaction was started by adding 25 ~1 of labeled
substrate, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37°c. the
reaction was then stopped by adding hydrochloric acid (2n). the
products of the reaction were extracted with 2 ml of benzene-ethyl
acetate (1:1, volume to volume). triton x-100 toluene scintillation
liquid (10 ml) was added to 1.0 ml samples of the extract, and the
radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. enzyme activity was expressed as nanomoles per minute per milligram
of protein.
in vitro: in investigating the effects of these antidepressant drugs
on m a o activity in vitro, the enzyme was preincubated for 20 rain
at 25°c with the reagents at concentrations of 1.0 mm to 1.0 txm
before adding the substrates. the remaining m a o activity was measured after the substrates were added. final concentrations of substrates were 200 ixm 5-ht and 50 btm [3-pea. the enzyme was used
the mitochondrial fractions obtained from control mice.

k~ and v.~ values
the km and v~ax values for the mitochondrial preparations of mice
that either received one of the drugs or saline solution for 4 weeks
were determined from lineweaver-burk double-reciprocal plots of
values obtained from graphic representation of kinetic data. line-

injections (30 mg/kg) of these reagents for 4 weeks. the changes in
mao k~ and v~a~ values in the mitochondrial preparations using
5-ht and i3-pea as substrates are shown in table 1. mao-a vmax

values was observed with viloxazine, imipramine, and  xxxd2746xxx .

effects of antidepressant drugs on m a o activity in vitro
to determine the mechanism by which mac) activity was inhibited
by these drugs, the effects of various concentrations of these reagents on mao in the mitochondria of mouse brain were studied
in vitro using 5-ht and i3-pea as substrates. when the dicyclic antidepressants,  xxxd3555xxx , and viloxazine were used, the residual activity of mac)-a was 60% with 1.0 mm viloxazine and the residual
activity of mac)-b was 40% (fig. 1). when  xxxd3555xxx  was used,
both mac)-a and mac)-b activity was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner.
all of the tricydic antidepressant drugs (imipramine, nortriptyline, and amitriptyline) potently inhibited mac) activity in a dosedependent manner; using 1.0 mm of each drug, the residual activity
was recorded as follows: 25% and 15% with imipramine; 2% and
10% with amitripryline, and 5% and 15% with nortripryline for
ma©-a and mac)-b, respectively (fig. 2).
when the tetracyclic antidepressant maprotiline and the noncyclic antidepressant,  xxxd2746xxx , were used, inhibition patterns
were similar to those recorded with viloxazine and  xxxd3555xxx ; the residual activity was 35% and 20% with maprotiline and 60% and

the kinetics of the inhibition of mao by the addition of these reagents were investigated using lineweaver-burk double-reciprocal
plots. the results using 5-ht and [3-pea as substrates are shown in
figure 4. all of these reagents were competitive inhibitors of mitochondrial mao-a in mouse brain (fig. 4, left), whereas all the
drugs were noncompetitive inhibitors of mao-b and caused a decrease in vm~xand no change in km (fig. 4, right).
the respective k~values were calculated by the method of dixon
and expressed as mean _+ standard error of the mean (se) for determinations in three preparations of mouse brain from the apparent
michaelis constants (table 2). for all drugs, both mao-a and
mao-b k, values were higher than the kmvalues, except in the case
of m a o - a and nortriptyline. furthermore, both mao-a and

mao-b k, values for nortriptyline were much lower than the values
for the other drugs.
discussion
it is known that tricyclic antidepressant drugs competitively inhibit
mao, and that in vitro, these drugs are more potent for mao-b
than mao-a (roth and gillis, 1974a). these drugs are thought to
produce some changes in the mao molecule after long-term administration of antidepressant drugs in vivo. in the present study,
m a o - a and mao-b in mouse brain were inhibited after long-term
administration of various antidepressant drugs, including dicyclic,
tricyclic, tetracyclic, and non-cyclic antidepressant drugs except
nortriptyline (mao-a was not affected) and maprotyline (neither
mao-a nor mao-b were affected).
analysis of ma© kinetics in each group showed a significant decrease in m a o - a vm~xvalues in mice treated with antidepressant
drugs, whereas a significant increase in mao-b km values was ob-

whereas mao-b deaminates [3-pea (neff and yang, 1974). in addition, a recent report has documented that dopamine also is oxidized by mao-b (butcher et al., 1990). thus, this inhibition in
m a o - a or mao-b activity may account for some of the observed
characteristic changes of serotonergic or dopaminergic neurons associated with repeated administration of these antidepressants in
mice. moreover, all antidepressants, used in this study, inhibited
m a o - a competitively, whereas mao-b did so noncompetitively.
it is not clear, however, how the different inhibition of m a o by antidepressants occurs. it is considered that the differences in the sensitivity of brain m a o to inhibition by these antidepressants may exist due to evidence of multiple catalytic sites on a single enzyme
species.
of the antidepressant drugs used, we found the tricyclic antidepressant drugs to be the most selective inhibitors of m a o activity
in mitochondrial preparations from the cerebral cortex of the
mouse. we also found that nortriptyline did not inhibit either form
of m a o in vivo, even though it was a more potent inhibitor of both
forms of m a © in vitro. moreover,  xxxd2746xxx  inhibited both forms
of m a o in vivo, even though it was a weak inhibitor for both forms
of m a o in vitro. further studies are necessary to determine whether
or not these effects are important with regard to the antidepressive
action of antidepressant drugs.

served. in addition, the mao-b vm~ values in the mice treated with
viloxazine, imipramine, and  xxxd2746xxx  decreased significantly
compared with that of the control group. the decrease in m a o activity appeared to be due to a decrease in the number of m a o molecules as judged from the decrease in vmaxin the enzyme preparations
from mice treated with antidepressant drugs.
these findings agree with a previous report (schildkraut et al.,
1970) stating that long-term treatment with imipramine depressed
the deamination of some biogenic amines in rat brain. asberg et al.
