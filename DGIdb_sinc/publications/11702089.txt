importance of sex and relative efficacy at the µ opioid receptor
in the development of tolerance and cross-tolerance
to the antinociceptive effects of opioids

abstract rationale: recent studies indicate that µ opioids are generally more potent and effective as antinociceptive agents in male than female rodents. objectives:
to evaluate the influence of sex on the development of
tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of morphine and
cross-tolerance to the lower efficacy µ opioids buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx  in f344 and lewis rats. methods:
using a warm-water tail-withdrawal procedure, the antinociceptive effects of morphine, buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx  were determined before and during chronic morphine (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, b.i.d., for 7 and 14 days) administration. results: under acute conditions, morphine
was more potent in males and during chronic morphine
administration tolerance development was generally
greater in males. as males were more sensitive to the
acute effects of morphine, the functional chronic morphine dose (i.e., chronic morphine dose/acute morphine
ed50) administered to males was larger than in females.
analyses of the relationship between the functional
chronic morphine dose and tolerance indicated that morphine tolerance development was comparable in males
and females. under acute conditions, buprenorphine and
 xxxd1864xxx  were more potent and effective in males. during chronic morphine administration, cross-tolerance
was conferred to these opioids as evidenced by rightward, and in some cases downward, shifts in their dosea.c. barrett (✉) · j.m. terner · m.j. picker

effect curves. decreases in the maximal effects produced
by buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx  were more frequently
observed in females. conclusions: that comparable levels of morphine tolerance were obtained in males and females when the functional chronic morphine dose was
taken into consideration suggests that the mechanism underlying tolerance is not sex-dependent. sex differences
in the effectiveness of buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx  when
administered acutely and during chronic morphine administration further suggest that these opioids have lower efficacy at the µ opioid receptor in females.

introduction
sex differences in the antinociceptive potency of morphine have been reported in rodents using a variety of
nociceptive assays (kepler et al. 1989; cicero et al.
1996, 1997; kest et al. 1999). when sex differences are
observed, males are generally more sensitive than females, with the magnitude of this difference varying
markedly across rodent strains. for example, morphine
is more potent in males of some mouse strains (akr,
c57bl/6, swr), equally potent in others (129, a,
balb/c, c3h/he, dba/2, lp, sjl) and more potent in
females in another (cba) (kest et al. 1999). sex differences in the antinociceptive potency of morphine are
also larger in f344 than lewis rats (cook et al. 2000),
and larger in long evans and sprague-dawley rats than
in wistar kyoto rats (mogil et al. 2000). pharmacokinetic factors can not sufficiently account for these sex differences, as after systemic injection blood and brain concentrations of morphine are similar in male and female
sprague-dawley rats (cicero et al. 1997). moreover, sex
differences in the potency of morphine as an antinociceptive agent are observed even when pharmacokinetic
factors are minimized, such as following direct adminis-

tration of morphine into the ventricles, ventrolateral periaqueductal gray or ventromedial medulla (kepler et al.
1989, 1991; boyer et al. 1998; krzanowska and bodnar
1999).
although there are a variety of reports investigating
sex differences in the acute antinociceptive effects of
opioids, relatively few studies have examined sex differences in the development of tolerance. thus, one purpose of the present study was to examine the influence of
sex on the magnitude of antinociceptive tolerance development to various morphine maintenance doses in two
strains of rats, f344 and lewis, that display marked sex
differences in sensitivity to the acute antinociceptive effects of µ opioids (cook et al. 2000). craft et al. (1999)
recently reported that morphine tolerance was greater in
males than females, but it was noteworthy that males
were also more sensitive to the acute antinociceptive effects of morphine. as such, by administering the same
absolute chronic morphine dose to males and females,
males received a larger functional dose (i.e., the relationship between the dose of morphine administered chronically and the potency of morphine under prechronic conditions). for example, the morphine ed50 was 7.18 and
11.49 mg/kg in males and females, respectively. by administering 20 mg/kg morphine daily to both males and
females for the first week of treatment, the males received a chronic dose that was 2.8-fold larger than their
ed50, whereas for females the chronic dose was only
1.7-fold larger than their ed50. one purpose of the present study, therefore, was to examine whether sex differences in tolerance development could be attributed to sex
differences in the prechronic potency of morphine.
recent studies indicate that the relative efficacy of the
opioid is a determinant of the magnitude of sex differences in opioid-induced antinociception. in general, it
has been observed that sex differences in the potency
and effectiveness of opioids increase with decreases in
the relative efficacy of the opioid (negus and mello
1999; cook et al. 2000). additionally, previous studies
also indicate that cross-tolerance to the antinociceptive
effects of µ opioids is greater to lower efficacy opioids,
as evidenced by larger rightward shifts in the dose-effect
curve, and larger decrements in their maximal effectiveness (stevens and yaksh 1989; paronis and holtzman
1992; walker and young 2001). for example, tiano et
al. (1999) reported that chronic treatment with the µ opioid  xxxd2070xxx  produced 3.3- and 5.9-fold rightward shifts
in the dose-effect curves for morphine and the lower efficacy opioid buprenorphine, respectively. further, in  xxxd2070xxx -tolerant rats the dose-effect curve for the low efficacy opioid  xxxd1864xxx  was shifted 6.6-fold to the right
and downward such that even the highest dose tested
produced only a half-maximal effect. given the relatively large sex differences in the potency and efficacy of
lower efficacy µ opioids as well as the greater sensitivity
of lower efficacy opioids to challenge with chronic opioid treatment, these opioids could afford a valuable tool to
further assess sex differences in tolerance development.
a second purpose of the present study, therefore, was to

examine the influence of sex on the magnitude of crosstolerance to the lower efficacy µ opioids buprenorphine
and  xxxd1864xxx  in rats treated chronically with morphine.

materials and methods
animals
gonadally intact male and female f344 and lewis rats were obtained from charles river suppliers (raleigh, n.c., usa). all
testing occurred between 3 and 6 months of age, and rats had unlimited access to water and food (food intake for lewis males was
occasionally limited such that stable body weights would be maintained). all rats were individually housed in a colony maintained
on a 12-h light/dark cycle. all testing occurred between the hours
of 8:00 and 10:30 a.m.
habituation and dose-response testing
on three occasions prior to the start of testing, each rat was habituated to plastic restraint tubes for approximately 30 min. in order
to habituate rats further to testing and injection procedures, the antinociceptive effects of selected doses of morphine were then determined, although these data were not used in subsequent analyses. during tests for antinociception, rats were placed in the restraint tubes with their tails hanging freely over the edge of a table
and the distal 7 cm of the tail was immersed into an insulated mug
containing water taken from baths maintained at each designated
temperature. the latency to tail-withdrawal was recorded at 40°c
(control) water and then at 52 and 55°c water. tests at each temperature were separated by 2–3 min. a 15-s cut-off was imposed
in all tests in order to minimize potential tissue damage. at 40°c
water, rats from both strains and sexes failed to withdraw their tail
by the 15-s cut-off time.
after baseline latencies were recorded, the first injection of
drug was administered (ip) and after 15 min the latency to remove
the tail from the water was determined. the 52°c and 55°c water
temperatures were each presented once, with the order of testing
counterbalanced across rats. immediately following these tests, the
next drug dose was administered such that each successive dose
increased the total drug dose by 0.25 or 0.5 log units. fifteen minutes after the drug injection, latency to tail-withdrawal from the
water was again determined. all test sessions lasted 2–2.5 h.
chronic dosing regimen
in each group of rats (n=5–6), the antinociceptive effects of either
morphine, buprenorphine or  xxxd1864xxx  were determined under
acute (i.e., prechronic) conditions. in rats that received morphine
or  xxxd1864xxx  acutely, chronic morphine administration commenced
2–3 days later. because buprenorphine has long-lasting effects at
µ opioid receptors, chronic morphine administration commenced
8–9 days following determination of the acute buprenorphine
dose-effect curve. during the chronic phase of testing, different
groups of rats received 5, 10, 20 or 30 (lewis females only)
mg/kg morphine administered b.i.d. with the first injection at
8:00 a.m. and the second at 8:00 p.m. to minimize toxicity, when
administering 20 and 30 mg/kg morphine chronically, the morphine dose was increased gradually over 3 days. in each group,
chronic morphine administration continued for 7 days, and on day
8 (8:00 a.m.), a dose-effect curve for the test opioid was redetermined (the morphine maintenance dose was not administered at
8:00 p.m.). in rats tested acutely with morphine and treated chronically with 10 or 20 mg/kg morphine, the chronic dosing regimen
was continued for 7 more days, when on day 15, a dose-effect
curve for morphine was redetermined.

156
antagonism testing
under certain chronic morphine treatment conditions, buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx  produced maximal effects in males but not females. to determine if this decrease in maximal effect reflected a
decrease in the drugs' relative efficacy at the µ opioid receptor, antagonism tests were conducted in which these opioids were administered in combination with morphine (kenakin 1993). in these
tests, rats (n=4–6) were treated chronically with morphine, and
7–9 days after the initiation of the chronic regimen the timecourse of a 56 mg/kg dose of morphine was determined. two days
later, the highest dose of buprenorphine (3 mg/kg) or  xxxd1864xxx 
(30 mg/kg) tested prechronically was administered in combination
with 56 mg/kg morphine, and the time course of this drug combination was determined. on the day that the time-course of morphine was determined, morphine maintenance doses were not administered. a similar analysis was conducted in lewis males, as
during some chronic morphine treatment conditions, buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx  produced high levels of antinociception in
f344 males but not lewis males.
data analysis
for dose-effect and time-course testing, latencies to tail-withdrawal following administration of drug were converted to percent
maximal effect using the following equation: % antinociceptive
effect=[(observed–baseline)/(15 s–baseline)]×100. to compare the
potency of the opioids across groups under acute conditions, ed50
values (95% confidence limits) were calculated using the linear
portion of the dose-effect curve under conditions in which maximal (≥80%) or near maximal effects were obtained. to quantify
the magnitude of morphine tolerance that developed under the various dosing regimens, relative potency estimates were calculated
(tallarida and murray 1987) in which the potency of morphine under prechronic conditions was compared to the potency of morphine during chronic morphine administration. the rightward shift
in the dose-response curve was considered to be significant if the
95% confidence interval did not overlap 1.0. to control for sex
and strain differences in the acute potency of morphine, the functional chronic dose of morphine was calculated for individual rats
as the ratio between the daily chronic dose of morphine and the
potency of morphine under prechronic conditions (i.e., chronic
daily morphine dose/individual morphine ed50 under prechronic
conditions). this statistic was used to construct a least-squares regression line of the relationship between the functional chronic
dose of morphine and magnitude of tolerance. to compare the
slopes of the regression lines for males and females, a t-test was
conducted on the difference between two independent regression
coefficients. a similar analysis was conducted to compare the yintercept values for males and females. for buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx , relative potency estimates could not always be calculated,
as maximal effects were not always observed. for these opioids,
analyses of the maximal effect obtained before and during chronic
morphine treatment were conducted using a repeated-measures
analysis of variance (anova) with sex, strain and chronic morphine dose as the between-groups factors and temperature as the
repeated-measures factor. simple effects analyses (pairwise comparisons) were then conducted to examine the effect of sex within
a strain at each water temperature. for time-course analyses, oneway anovas were conducted on the area under the curve, estimated using the trapezoidal rule (tallarida and murray 1987). for
all statistical analyses, the alpha level was set at 0.05.
drugs
the following drugs were used:  xxxd2670xxx , buprenorphine
hcl (both provided by the national institute on drug abuse), and
 xxxd1864xxx  hcl (astra pharmaceuticals). small amounts of lactic
acid were added to buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx  to promote solubility. the ph of buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx  ranged from 5.5 to
6.0. doses for all drugs are expressed in terms of the salts. all

drugs were dissolved in distilled water and administered in an injection volume of 0.5–1.0 ml/kg.

results
morphine tolerance
in males and females of the f344 and lewis strains,
morphine produced dose-dependent increases in antinociception in both the 52°c and 55°c water, with maximal effects obtained at the highest dose tested. as shown
in table 1, there were no consistent strain differences in
the potency of morphine; however, morphine was approximately 2.0-fold more potent in f344 and lewis
males than their female counterparts.
figure 1 shows the antinociceptive effects of morphine before (prechronic) and during chronic treatment
with the 20 mg/kg dose of morphine in f344 and lewis
male and female rats. although data were collected at
two water temperatures using various chronic dosing
regimens, for simplicity this figure depicts data for only
the highest chronic dose and the highest water temperature tested. after 7 days of chronic treatment with
20 mg/kg morphine, tolerance to the effects of morphine
developed in all groups of rats, as evidenced by rightward shifts in the dose-effect curves. in general, continuing chronic morphine administration for 14 days produced small additional rightward shifts in the dose-effect
curves, although in females this effect was not as pronounced. at both 7 and 14 days, similar effects were obtained when tests were conducted at 52°c.

table 2 shows the relative potency estimates for male
and female rats of the f344 and lewis strains when tested with each chronic dosing regimen. morphine tolerance was observed in all groups treated chronically with
the 10 and 20 mg/kg morphine and in only some groups
treated with 5 mg/kg morphine. additionally, the magnitude of tolerance was generally greater in rats treated
chronically with the 20 than the 10 mg/kg dose of morphine, and smallest in rats treated chronically with the

5 mg/kg dose of morphine. when collapsed across all
dosing regimens, the magnitude of tolerance was greater
for males in the majority of tests conducted  xxxd2274xxx  days and
in all tests conducted after 14 days. differences between
males and females reached significant levels in f344 rats
treated chronically with 10 mg/kg morphine at tests conducted after both 7 and 14 days, and in lewis rats treated
chronically with 20 mg/kg morphine at tests conducted
after 14 days.
differences between males and females in the functional chronic doses of morphine (i.e., chronic morphine
dose per day/individual morphine ed50 under prechronic
conditions) administered, however, complicated analyses
of the magnitude of morphine tolerance. as a result of
morphine being more potent in males under prechronic
conditions, males received functionally larger chronic
doses of morphine. for example, in f344 rats that received 10 mg/kg morphine chronically, the males, being
more sensitive to the acute antinociceptive effects of
morphine, received a functional chronic dose of morphine that was approximately 3.3 times larger than that
administered to females. to control for these sex differences, a linear regression analysis of individual data was
conducted in which rightward shifts in the dose-response
curve were plotted against the functional chronic dose of
morphine administered. as such, sex and/or strain differences in the magnitude of tolerance would be manifested
as differences in the slope or intercept of the linear regression lines.

administered to their female counterparts, an additional group of
lewis females treated with 30 mg/kg morphine chronically was
included, in an attempt to facilitate male-female comparisons.
plotted on the y-axis is the magnitude of tolerance, which was determined by dividing the ed50 for morphine obtained during the
chronic morphine regimen by the ed50 for morphine obtained in
the prechronic phase of testing. plotted on the x-axis is the functional chronic dose of morphine, which was determined by dividing the daily chronic dose of morphine by the individual morphine
ed50 under prechronic conditions. two data points are plotted for
each individual rat, one point each for 52° and 55°c water. t-tests
performed on the slope coefficients and y-intercepts indicated no
significant (p>0.05) sex or strain differences in the slopes or
y-intercepts of the regression lines fitted to these data

phine and higher values on the y-axis represent greater
magnitudes of tolerance. for all groups tested after both
7 and 14 days, a linear relationship was evident such that
higher functional chronic doses of morphine were associated with greater magnitudes of morphine tolerance.
that is, there was a dose-dependent relationship between
the functional chronic dose of morphine and the magnitude of tolerance. tests performed on the slope coefficients and y-intercepts indicated no significant sex or
strain differences in the slopes or y-intercepts of the regression lines fitted to these data. thus, the magnitude of
morphine tolerance was comparable between sexes and
strains when the functional chronic dose of morphine
was taken into consideration.

were markedly greater than that obtained in f344 and

chronic administration of 5 and 10 mg/kg morphine
produced cross-tolerance to buprenorphine in male and
female rats of both strains. a repeated-measures
anova calculated for the maximal effect produced by
buprenorphine before and during chronic treatment indicated a main effect of sex [f(1,84)=62.06, p<0.05],
chronic dose [f(1,84)=68.88, p<0.05], and a strain by
sex interaction [f(1,84)=7.94, p<0.05]. additionally, effects were observed for temperature [f(1,84)=143.60,
p<0.05], as well as a temperature by sex interaction
[f(1,84)=13.43, p<0.05]. the magnitude of tolerance
was greater for the 10 mg/kg than for the 5 mg/kg maintenance dose, as indicated by larger rightward shifts in
the dose-effect curve or larger decrements in the maximal effect. in f344 males at 52°c, for example, chronic
treatment with 5 and 10 mg/kg morphine produced a 4.5fold (95% confidence limits: 2.7–7.8) and 22.9-fold
(10.4–47.6) rightward shift in the buprenorphine dose-effect curve, respectively. in contrast, in f344 females at
52°c the maximal effectiveness of buprenorphine decreased with increases in the morphine maintenance
dose. figure 4 shows a comparison of the change in
maximal effect of buprenorphine from prechronic to
chronic morphine treatment conditions in f344 males
and females. at 52°c, the maximal effect of buprenorphine was greater in f344 males than females treated
chronically with both 5 and 10 mg/kg morphine. in contrast, the maximal effect obtained at 55°c was markedly
decreased in both males and females such that no significant sex differences were observed.
in lewis males (fig. 3), chronic treatment with
5 mg/kg morphine produced a 4.4-fold (2.8–6.9) right-

ward shift in the dose-effect curve for buprenorphine at
52°c without altering the maximal effect. chronic treatment with 10 mg/kg morphine produced decreases in the
maximal effect of buprenorphine. in contrast, in females
tested at 52°c, decreases in the maximal effect of buprenorphine were observed during chronic treatment with
both 5 and 10 mg/kg morphine. as shown in fig. 4, at
52°c water the maximal effect of buprenorphine was
greater in males treated with 5 mg/kg morphine than in
females. as observed with f344 rats, at 55°c there were
marked decreases in maximal effect of buprenorphine
such that no significant sex differences were observed.
figure 5 shows the effects of  xxxd1864xxx  in f344 and
lewis males and females before and during chronic administration of 5 and 10 mg/kg morphine. under prechronic
conditions,  xxxd1864xxx  was more potent and effective at
52°c in f344 and lewis males than in f344 and lewis females, respectively (see table 1). at 55°c, the maximal effect obtained in f344 and lewis males was markedly
greater than in their female counterparts (see table 1).
chronic administration of 5 and 10 mg/kg morphine
produced cross-tolerance to  xxxd1864xxx  in male and female
rats of both strains. a repeated-measures anova calculated for the maximal effect produced by  xxxd1864xxx  before
and during chronic morphine treatment indicated a main
effect for sex [f(1,77)=66.69, p<0.05], strain
[f(1,77)=33.61, p<0.05] chronic dose [f(1,77)=44.66,
p<0.05], a strain by sex interaction [f(1,77)=11.56,
p<0.05], and a sex by chronic dose interaction
[f(1,77)=6.08, p<0.05]. in f344 males, chronic administration of 5 mg/kg morphine produced a 9.1-fold
(6.0–13.9) rightward shift in the  xxxd1864xxx  dose-effect
curve at 52°c and a 9.4-fold (4.99–16.53) shift at 55°c.
these shifts were obtained without decrements in the
maximal effect. however, at both 52 and 55°c, chronic
administration of 10 mg/kg morphine produced decre-

ments in the maximal effect of  xxxd1864xxx . in f344 females at both water temperatures, the maximal effect obtained with  xxxd1864xxx , which was relatively low under
acute conditions, decreased in magnitude during both
chronic dosing regimens. as shown in fig. 4, at 52°c,
the maximal effect of  xxxd1864xxx  was greater in f344
males than females treated chronically with both 5 and
10 mg/kg morphine. at 55°c, the maximal effect obtained was greater in f344 males than females treated
chronically with 5 mg/kg morphine but not with
10 mg/kg morphine. in lewis males and females, chronic treatment with 5 and 10 mg/kg morphine produced decreases in the maximal effectiveness of  xxxd1864xxx  at both
water temperatures. although the maximal effect obtained in males treated chronically with 5 mg/kg morphine was greater than in females at 52°c, this difference
did not reach statistical significance.
antagonism
following chronic administration of 5 mg/kg morphine,
maximal effects were obtained with buprenorphine at
52°c water in males of both strains, but not in their female counterparts. similarly, sex differences were obtained with  xxxd1864xxx  during treatment with 5 and
10 mg/kg morphine with the effects obtained in f344
males being larger than in females. one explanation of
these findings is that buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx  function as lower efficacy µ opioids in females than males.
to evaluate this possibility, the time-course of the effects
of morphine alone and in combination with buprenorphine or  xxxd1864xxx  was determined. in these tests, antagonism of the antinociceptive effects of morphine by buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx  would indicate that these opioids have lower efficacy at the µ receptor in females,

whereas the failure of these drugs to antagonize the effects of morphine or an enhancement of the effects of
morphine would suggest that doses higher than those
tested in the dose-effect analyses may have produced
maximal effects or that these opioids had limited access
to the µ opioid receptor (kenakin 1993; morgan et al.
1999). figure 6 shows the effects of 56 mg/kg morphine
alone and in combination with buprenorphine or  xxxd1864xxx  at 52°c in f344 and lewis females treated chronically with 5 mg/kg morphine. morphine alone produced
maximal effects that peaked at 30–60 min and then declined until they reached control levels by 240 min. in
f344 [f(1,10)=13.60, p<0.05] and lewis [f(1,10)=
24.60, p<0.05] females, 3 mg/kg buprenorphine antagonized the effects of morphine. similarly, in f344 females
treated chronically with 10 mg/kg morphine, 30 mg/kg
 xxxd1864xxx  antagonized the effects of morphine
[f(1,6)=7.30, p<0.05].
because buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx  produced submaximal effects in lewis males under some conditions in
which they produced maximal effects in f344 males, it
was also important to determine whether these opioids
antagonized the effects of morphine in lewis males. figure 7 shows the effects of morphine alone and in combi-

nation with selected doses of buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx 
in lewis males treated chronically with 10 mg/kg morphine and tested at 52°c. in these tests, morphine alone
produced maximal effects that peaked at 15–30 min and
then declined until they reached control levels at 240 min.
both 3 mg/kg buprenorphine [f(1,10)=22.55, p<0.05]
and 30 mg/kg  xxxd1864xxx  [f(1,10)=28.18, p<0.05] antagonized the effects of morphine.

discussion
the present findings indicate that sex is an important determinant of opioid-induced antinociception under acute
conditions. morphine was more potent as an antinociceptive agent in males than their female counterparts and the
lower efficacy µ opioids buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx 
were more potent and effective in males. these findings
are consistent with a previous report suggesting that the
relative efficacy of µ opioids is greater in f344 and lewis
males than females (cook et al. 2000). the rankings of
the relative potency (buprenorphine> xxxd1864xxx >morphine) and effectiveness (morphine>buprenorphine> xxxd1864xxx ) of the µ opioids examined in the present investigation under acute conditions were comparable among
sexes and strains, and is in agreement with other reports
employing assays sensitive to the effects of µ opioids
(young et al. 1984; tiano et al. 1998; morgan et al.
1999; cook et al. 2000). thus, in f344 and lewis male
and female rats, it is likely that these opioids share a
common mechanism of action, presumably activation of
the µ opioid receptor.
in the present investigation, the magnitude of morphine tolerance in both male and female rats increased
with increases in the morphine maintenance dose and
generally with the duration of morphine treatment. such
findings are consistent with those reported in other rat
strains, dosing regimens and antinociception procedures
(adams and holtzman 1990; hoffman et al. 1998; craft
et al. 1999). of particular importance was the finding
that the magnitude of morphine tolerance was generally
greater in males than females of both the f344 and lewis
strains. this finding is in agreement with reports in adult
morphine-tolerant rats (kasson and george 1984; craft
et al. 1999) but contrasts with reports in neonatal rats
and mice demonstrating either no sex differences in morphine tolerance development (thornton and smith 1997;
thornton et al. 1997) or greater tolerance development
in females (kest et al. 2000). it is important to note that
in studies employing adult rats, males were generally
more sensitive than females to the acute antinociceptive
effects of morphine and thus received a larger functional
chronic dose of morphine. consequently, it would be expected that the magnitude of tolerance would be greater
in males. in the present investigation, morphine was approximately 2.0-fold more potent in males, and thus
males, on average, received a functional dose of morphine that was approximately 2.0-fold larger than that
administered to females. to control for sex and strain

fig. 8 linear regression plot of individual data in sprague-dawley males and females treated chronically with 10 mg/kg morphine
for 7 days and tested on a 52°c hotplate. plotted on the y-axis is
the magnitude of tolerance, which was determined by dividing the
ed50 for morphine obtained during the chronic morphine regimen
for individual rats by the ed50 for morphine obtained during the
prechronic phase of testing. on this axis, the higher values represent greater magnitudes of tolerance. plotted on the x-axis is the
functional chronic dose of morphine, which was determined by dividing the daily chronic dose of morphine by the individual morphine ed50 under prechronic conditions. on this axis, the higher

differences in the acute potency of morphine, the relationship between the functional chronic dose of morphine and the extent to which tolerance developed to the
effects of morphine was determined. this analysis accounts for individual differences in prechronic sensitivity
to the effects of morphine, and indicated that morphine
tolerance was comparable in males and females of both
rat strains. such findings suggest that the mechanisms
underlying morphine tolerance do not differ between
sexes or strains of rats, and the mechanism(s) that account for differences in the acute sensitivity to morphine
do not influence the development of tolerance.
given numerous reports indicating sex and strain differences in the acute effects of µ opioids, it remains a
possibility that morphine tolerance can develop differentially in other strains of rats. to evaluate this possibility
further, data from craft et al. (1999), in which a greater
degree of tolerance developed in sprague-dawley male
than female rats treated with 10 mg/kg (b.i.d.) for 7 days
and tested using a hot-plate assay, were reanalyzed controlling for the functional chronic dose of morphine administered. as shown in fig. 8, results from this analysis
were similar to those reported in the present investigation; when sex differences in the functional chronic dose
of morphine were taken into account, there were no sex
differences in the magnitude of tolerance development.
employing an analysis of functional as opposed to absolute chronic dose of morphine may help reconcile the

162

effects reported in some studies that have examined sex
differences in tolerance development. for example, kasson
and george (1984) reported a trend toward greater potency of morphine under acute conditions and a trend toward greater tolerance development in sprague-dawley
males than females that had been treated chronically
with equivalent absolute doses of morphine. other studies by thornton and colleagues (thornton and smith
1997; thornton et al. 1997) found no significant differences in the acute potency of morphine or fentanyl in
neonatal male and female rats and no differences in tolerance development.
in addition to examining the development of tolerance to morphine, a second purpose of the present study
was to examine cross-tolerance to the lower efficacy µ
opioids buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx . an important characteristic of low efficacy opioids is that in order to produce a maximal effect they must bind to a large proportion of the available receptor population (i.e., they have
small receptor reserve). as the receptor occupancy requirement to produce a maximal effect increases for a
given task, such as with increases in the intensity of the
nociceptive stimulus, low efficacy opioids can not activate a sufficient number of receptors to produce a maximal effect (e.g., for a discussion, see dirig and yaksh
1995; morgan et al. 1999). in the present investigation,
the acute administration of buprenorphine at 55°c was
generally less effective than morphine in producing antinociception.  xxxd1864xxx  appeared to be less efficacious
than buprenorphine, as even at 52°c maximal effects
were obtained only in f344 males. overall, buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx  were more potent and effective in
males than females, and more potent and effective in
f344 than lewis males.
changes in potency and maximal effectiveness of an
opioid during chronic opioid administration are analogous to that observed upon increasing the intensity of the
nociceptive stimulus. indeed, chronic administration of
high efficacy opioids appears to produce decreases in the
functional receptor population (i.e., decrease receptor reserve), and because lower efficacy opioids require greater receptor occupancy than higher efficacy opioids,
chronic opioid administration produces a greater change
in their potency and maximal effectiveness (paronis and
holtzman 1992; smith et al. 1999; walker and young
2001). in the present investigation, chronic morphine administration produced larger rightward shifts in the doseeffect curves for buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx  than for
morphine. decreases in the maximal effect of buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx  were also observed under conditions
in which the maximal effect of the higher efficacy opioid
morphine was unaltered.
during chronic morphine treatment there were
marked sex differences in the effects of buprenorphine
and  xxxd1864xxx . for example, at 52°c the maximal effects
produced by buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx  decreased in
both f344 and lewis females under conditions in which
there was little or no change in the maximal effects in
their male counterparts. in contrast, at 55°c large decre-

ments in the maximal effects of buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx  were generally observed in both males and females.
thus, there were both sex and strain differences in the
maximal effect produced by buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx 
during chronic morphine treatment, and these differences
depended, in part, on the intensity of the nociceptive
stimulus (see also smith et al. 1999).
sex differences in the maximal effect produced by buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx  during chronic morphine administration may be interpreted in different ways. one
interpretation is that the mechanism underlying tolerance
differs in male and female rats. arguing against this interpretation is the finding that morphine tolerance appears to develop at similar rates and to similar extents in
males and females. alternatively, these sex differences
could reflect the observation that these opioids function
as lower efficacy opioids in females than males. that is,
under acute conditions these opioids are less potent and
effective in females (cook et al. 2000), and during
chronic morphine treatment these opioids were less effective in producing an antinociceptive effect in females.
the finding that the rank order of potency and maximal
effectiveness of buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx  during both
acute and chronic conditions were identical suggests that
differences in the relative efficacy of these opioids, and
not differences in the magnitude of tolerance development, are the more likely explanation for the observed
sex differences.
another important characteristic of low efficacy opioids is that under conditions in which they fail to produce
maximal effects, there is an increase in their ability
to antagonize the effects of higher efficacy opioids
(kenakin 1993). during chronic morphine administration, buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx  antagonized the effects
of morphine in females under conditions in which they
functioned as agonists (i.e., produced maximal effects) in
males, further supporting the notion that these opioids
possess lower relative efficacy in females. buprenorphine also antagonized the effects of morphine in lewis
males under conditions in which maximal antinociceptive effects were observed in f344 males. the present
findings suggest that the mechanisms underlying the development of opioid tolerance are not sex- and strain-dependent, and that the sex and strain differences obtained
under both acute and chronic conditions with buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx  most likely reflect differences in the
underlying receptor reserve (i.e., efficacy). the cellular
mechanisms that account for these sex differences remain to be determined.
it is possible that factors known to influence opioidinduced antinociception could have affected the present
findings, such as gonadal hormones and stress. although
the influence of circulating gonadal hormones on opioidinduced antinociception has received considerable attention, no consistent effect has emerged. indeed, ovariectomy has been shown to increase (ali et al. 1995), decrease (kepler et al. 1989), or have no effect on (cicero
et al. 1996) the magnitude and/or potency of morphine as
an antinociceptive agent. the extent to which circulating

163

gonadal hormones affect tolerance development is also
unclear, although one study showed a trend toward greater morphine tolerance in ovariectomized than intact female rats (kasson and george 1984).
activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa)
axis in response to stressors can also be both sex- and
strain-dependent (dhabhar et al. 1996; grota et al. 1997;
stohr et al. 2000). in general, female rats (compared to
male rats) and f344 rats (compared to lewis rats) display heightened responses of the hpa axis in response to
stressors. however, the extent to which such a stressor
can potentiate morphine antinociception has been shown
to be comparable in f344 and lewis male rats (woolfolk
and holtzman 1995). in addition, this potentiation is reduced with increased habituation to the stressor
(calcagnetti and holtzman 1990), a technique employed
in the current study (see materials and methods). thus,
sex and strain differences in response to the stress of
handling/testing seem unlikely to account for the present
data.
in conclusion, these data indicate that chronic administration of the same doses of morphine produce greater
tolerance in males than females. however, when analyses were conducted on the functional chronic morphine
dose, which adjusts for different acute sensitivities to
morphine, morphine tolerance development was comparable in males and females. such findings suggest that
the mechanisms underlying morphine tolerance do not
differ between sexes or strains of rats. additionally, the
present finding of sex differences in the maximal effect
produced by buprenorphine and  xxxd1864xxx  suggest that
these opioids have lower efficacy in females. previous
studies demonstrate that sex and strain differences in the
antinociceptive effects of opioids are most apparent
when employing parameters that require high fractional
receptor occupancy to produce a maximal effect, such as
when relatively low efficacy opioids and relatively high
intensity nociceptive stimuli are used (negus and mello
1999; cook et al. 2000). chronic opioid administration,
by decreasing the functional receptor population, also increases the receptor occupancy requirement to produce a
maximal effect. in this regard, chronic opioid administration could represent a valuable tool to determine the
influence of both sex and strain on opioid-induced antinociception.
