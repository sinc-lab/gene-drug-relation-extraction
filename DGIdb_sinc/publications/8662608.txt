a sufficient capacity and balanced regulation of “high energy
phosphate” supply and turnover is essential for the proper
function of any cell. large amounts of energy-rich phosphagens
can be found in many cells or tissues throughout the animal
kingdom. in all vertebrates and also in some invertebrates this
 xxxd1759xxx  is phosphorylcreatine (pcr)1 (1). pcr and adp are
the products of the reversible transfer of g-phosphate groups
from atp to creatine, catalyzed by the creatine kinases (cks).
two fundamental types of cks can be found in vertebrates:
cytosolic and mitochondrial cks. the subcellular localization,
the biochemical and kinetic data, and the loss of flagellar

motility in spermatozoa upon inhibition of the ck system and
other data (for review, see ref. 2) led to the suggestion of a
metabolic pcr circuit with pcr as a transport and storage form
of high energy phosphate. the pcr circuit connects sites of high
energy phosphate production (glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation) with those of high energy phosphate consumption.
at the producing end of the circuit, ck is thought to have
privileged access to atp generated either by glycoclysis or by
oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondrial matrix and
uses this atp to generate pcr. at the receiving end, ck is
functionally coupled to various atpases (for instance myosin
atpase of myofibrils), which use the atp generated in the
reverse ck reaction.
in chicken there are five different ck subunits known so far;
three are found in the cytosol, two in mitochondria. the cytosolic subunits are called  xxxg468xxx  (muscle) and ba-ck and bb-ck
(brain, more acidic and more basic, respectively) and can
dimerize with each other (3–5). they are found soluble in the
cytosol, but fractions are also associated, for instance, with the
m-line of the sarcomeres (6), the sarcoplasmatic ca21-atpase
(7), or the spermatozoan tail.2 whereas in mammals there is
just one isoform of  xxxg467xxx , the two  xxxg467xxx  isoforms of the chicken
are derived from a single gene by alternative splicing of the
second exon (9, 10). additional heterogeneity of  xxxg467xxx  was
shown to be due to alternative initiation of translation (11) or
posttranslational phosphorylation (12–14). in tissues of adult
chicken,  xxxg468xxx  is predominantly found in skeletal muscle, but
contrary to mammals, it is absent from heart (3).  xxxg467xxx  is
expressed in almost all tissues and found enriched in various
regions of the brain, retina, heart, gizzard, gut, and sperm (2).
evidence for two different isoforms of chicken mitochondrial
ck (mi-ck) has been found by comparison of translated cdna
sequences, isolated from a leg muscle cdna library, to partial
amino-terminal protein sequences of mi-ck purified from
brain (15). these two isoforms were termed  xxxg469xxx  (a 5 more
acidic pi, in mammals it was called ubiquitous mi-ck by other
authors) and  xxxg470xxx  (b 5 more basic pi, sarcomeric mi-ck in
mammals) and are found in vivo exclusively as homodimers
and homooctamers (16, 17). the mi-cks are synthesized in the
cytosol as precursor proteins with distinct leader peptides (15,
18, 19) and get imported into the intermembrane space of
mitochondria.  xxxg470xxx  is normally coexpressed with  xxxg468xxx  and
is present in skeletal muscle and heart (15), but it also has been
found in sperm.2  xxxg469xxx  is distributed more ubiquitously and
has been detected, like  xxxg467xxx , in chicken brain, gut, and retina.
hence the expression of the mitochondrial cks matches to a
certain degree the pattern found for the cytosolic cks, indicating possible common regulatory mechanisms.

in both mammals and birds, the creatine kinase (ck)
family consists of four types of genes: cytosolic brain
type ( xxxg467xxx ); cytosolic muscle type ( xxxg468xxx ); mitochondrial ubiquitous, acidic type ( xxxg469xxx ); and mitochondrial sarcomeric, basic type ( xxxg470xxx ). we report here
the cloning of the chicken  xxxg469xxx  cdna and its gene.
amino acid sequences of the mature chicken mi-ck proteins show about 90% identity to the homologous mammalian isoforms. the leader peptides, however, which
are isoenzyme-specifically conserved among the mammalian mi-cks, are quite different in the chicken with
amino acid identity values compared with the mammalian leader peptides of 38.5–51.3%.
the chicken  xxxg469xxx  gene spans about 7.6 kilobases
and contains 9 exons. the region around exon 1 shows a
peculiar base composition, with more than 80% gc, and
has the characteristics of a cpg island. the upstream
sequences lack tata or ccaat boxes and display further properties of housekeeping genes. several transcription factor binding sites known from mammalian
mi-ck genes are absent from the chicken gene. although
the promoter structure suggests a ubiquitous range of
expression, analysis of  xxxg469xxx  transcripts in chicken
tissues shows a restricted pattern and therefore does
not fulfill all criteria of a housekeeping enzyme.

conservation of mi-ck genes and cdnas in mammals and birds

materials and methods

isolation and cloning of  xxxg469xxx  cdna- and
genomic sequences, rt-pcr
a first fragment of chicken  xxxg469xxx  was generated with the following
degenerate oligonucleotides synthesized on a gene assembler (pharmacia lkb biotech inc., uppsala, sweden): 59-gtcgacgtcgacggygaacgycagmgvcgvaggtaccc-39 (derived from the aminoterminal sequence gerqrrryp with two sali sites at the 59-end;
highly  xxxg469xxx  specific) and 59-gtyttrtcrttrttrtgcca-39 (complementary to amino acids 212–218, whnndkt; ck specific). degeneracy of these oligonucleotides was reduced by analysis of the codon
usage of the three available chicken ck sequences (9, 15, 26 –28). total
rna from chicken brain was reverse transcribed with random hexamer
primers. pcr on the obtained cdna was carried out for 60 cycles (94 °c
for 30 s, 50 °c for 30 s, 72 °c for 2 min) as described earlier (29). the
fragment was gel-purified, reamplified, subcloned into ptz19u (u. s.
biochemical corp.) and fully sequenced.
the whole amplified fragment, labeled with 32p, was used to screen
a chicken brain lgt10 cdna library (stratagene). a total of 2.5 3 105
plaques was screened at a density of 25.000 plaques/plate (100 3 100
mm). lift-offs were performed with biodyne type a nylon membranes
(1.2 mm, pall inc., east hills, ny) according to the manufacturer’s
conditions and were hybridized as described previously (30) without
formamide at 68 °c overnight. washing was done at room temperature
with three changes of 2 3 ssc, 0.1% sds, 15 min each.
a genomic embl3 library with high molecular weight dna from
chicken liver (clonetech, palo alto, ca), partially digested with mboi,
was obtained from dr. b. trueb (maurice e. müller institute, berne,
switzerland). a total of 3.6 3 106 plaques was screened at a density of
105 plaques/plate. plaque lift-offs were done as described above. hybridization with the 32p-labeled fragment of clone ub15–9 (ecori/smai
fragment, nucleotides 170 – 487 (see fig. 1a)) was done as above, but in
the presence of formamide at 42 °c. lift-offs were washed with 2 3
ssc, 0.1% sds at 65 °c.

race-rt-pcr
race-rt-pcr was carried out with the unspecific adaptor-, r0- and
r1-primers as described previously (31). the so-called gene-specific
primers (gsp) were the following oligonucleotides: 59-caagctgccactgctca-39 ( xxxg1929xxx –39-race), 59-ttcgacatctccaacct-39
(gsp2–39-race), 59-ctgagacggtagtagcgg-39 (rt- xxxg469xxx -59race), 59-tggcctgggttgtcc-39 ( xxxg1929xxx - xxxg469xxx -59-race), 59gcttggatccagatctgctttgtcacagagcc-39 (gsp2-mia-ck59-race, with bamhi and bglii sites at the 59-end), 59-gctcaggccacggatgctgcg-39 (rt- xxxg470xxx -59-race), 59-caaacacctcataggatt-39 ( xxxg1929xxx - xxxg470xxx -59-race), and 59-gaaaggatggccaggat-39 (gsp2- xxxg470xxx -59-race).
 xxxg469xxx -39-race—heat-denatured total rna from chicken gut was

reverse transcribed with the adaptor primer using avian myoblastoma
virus reverse transcriptase (biofinex, praroman, switzerland). pcrs
were done as follows: 3 min at 55 °c and 40 min at 72 °c were followed
by 40 cycles of 45 s at 94 °c, 1 min at 55 °c, and 2.5 min at 72 °c; pcr
2 was 35 cycles of 45 s at 94 °c, 1 min at 55 °c, and 2.5 min at 72 °c.
 xxxg469xxx  59-race—heat-denatured poly(a)1-selected rna from
chicken brain was reverse-transcribed with the rt-primer. cycling
conditions were as follows: 3 min at 45 °c and 40 min at 72 °c were
followed by 40 cycles of 50 s at 94 °c, 1 min at 50 °c, and 2 min at 72 °c;
pcr 2 was 35 cycles of 50 s at 94 °c, 1 min at 50 °c, and 2 min at 72 °c.
in all steps, t4- xxxg32xxx -protein (pharmacia lkb biotech inc. uppsala,
sweden) and perfect match polymerase enhancer (stratagene) were
used.
 xxxg470xxx  59-race—heat-denatured poly(a)1-selected rna from
chicken leg muscle was reverse-transcribed using moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (life technologies ag, basel, switzerland) with the rt-primer. cycling conditions were as follows: pcr 1
was done as in the  xxxg469xxx -39-race; pcr 2 was done as in the
 xxxg469xxx -59-race.
obtained products were verified with an internal, 32p-labeled oligonucleotide by southern blotting, subcloning, and sequencing. additional  xxxg469xxx  59-race-rt-pcrs were performed with a set of oligonucleotides derived from a 60-bp stretch located in exon 1, with
methylmercuric hydroxide-denatured rna and with other reverse
transcriptases.

restriction mapping and southern blot analysis
genomic dna was prepared from chicken erythrocytes with the
proteinase k method (30). restriction digests of genomic dna or plasmid dna were done overnight according to the manufacturer’s conditions (boehringer mannheim and new england biolabs). digests of
dna were analyzed by agarose-gel electrophoresis followed by transfer
onto nylon membranes (pall inc.). after uv cross-linking, the membranes were hybridized according to church and gilbert (32), if oligonucleotides were used, or as described in sambrook et al. (30) for larger
cdna probes. for the 64-bp probe, denhardt’s solution was left out of
the hybridization mixture as suggested in recently published protocols
(30).

radioactive labeling of dna probes
vector-free fragments were isolated from low melting point agarose
with agarase (boehringer mannheim). dna (20 – 40 ng) was labeled
with [a-32p]dctp (5000 ci/mmol, amersham corp.) by the random
primer method (33). pcr labeling by direct incorporation was done
exactly as described previously (34). approximately 0.3 ng of fragment,
as obtained in a normal pcr, served as template with 150 mci of
[a-32p]dctp. oligonucleotides used were 59-ctgctcgcccgggacacg-39 and 59-cagcactgggcgggtagcg-39. the cycling conditions were 30 s at 95 °c, 1 min at 58 °c, and 30 s at 72 °c. oligonucleotides were labeled with [g-32p]atp (5000 ci/mmol, amersham
corp.) by t4-polynuclotide kinase (new england biolabs) according to
the manufacturer’s conditions.

sequencing
sequencing was carried out according to the method of sanger et al.
(35). cycle sequencing was performed with the fmol kit (promega); the
annealing step in the cycling procedure was done at the tm of the
oligonucleotide. maxam-gilbert sequencing was done according to the
modified method of som and tomizawa (36).

construction of plasmids for rnase protection and
in situ hybridization
 xxxg469xxx  (pstm5)—pcr on clone ub15–9 was done with the primer
59-ttacaagttaacccggcactgagccacg-39 (hpai site at 59-end)
and the r-primer of pgem3-zf (promega). cycling conditions were 30 s
at 95 °c, 30 s at 46 °c, and 1 min at 72 °c. the fragment was digested
(hpai, ecori), gel purified, and subcloned into pgem3-zf(2).
 xxxg467xxx  (pstm6)—the 39-terminal haeiii-fragment of the chicken
 xxxg467xxx  clone puc8 –18b/e (9), comprising most of the 39-utr, was cloned
into pgem3-zf(2). it was reexcised with bamhi and hindiii and
subcloned into ptz19u to allow transcription with t7 rna polymerase.
all plasmids were grown in escherichia coli xl-1 blue (stratagene),
and dna was isolated either by an alkali lysis-type method (30) or by
column preparation (nucleobond ax kit, machery-nagel, oensingen,
switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s descriptions.

suggested a highly conserved protein family and allowed the
construction of an evolutionary tree (20). this tree predicts
three gene duplications at the origin of the four ck isoforms,
which is in agreement with observations on the gene structures
of the four published human ck genes (21–25). in chicken, only
the  xxxg467xxx  gene has been completely analyzed so far, and fragments of the  xxxg468xxx  gene indicate an extraordinarily big size
(10).
to gain further insight into the evolution of the ck isoenzyme family, the chicken  xxxg469xxx  protein sequence and the
 xxxg469xxx  gene structure were elucidated as the first nonmammalian mi-ck gene. the chicken  xxxg469xxx  leader peptides were
analyzed in order to determine if the functional chicken peptides are isoprotein-specifically conserved. analysis of the promoter elements of the  xxxg469xxx  gene was carried out to investigate if the expression pattern of  xxxg469xxx  is coupled to  xxxg467xxx 
expression, indicating common regulatory mechanisms of these
two genes. in order to test if such mechanisms are active in the
chicken, the expression patterns in several adult tissues were
studied. the structure of the chicken  xxxg469xxx  gene, including
the localization of intron-exon boundaries was analyzed, and
the structure was compared with the mammalian ubiquitous
mi-ck genes, allowing conclusions on the evolutionary relationship of these genes.

rnase protection
total rna was prepared from excised tissue specimen from adult
chicken according to the method of chomczynski and sacchi (37). two
ml of solution d were used per 100 mg of tissue for homogenization with
a polytron mixer.
plasmids pstm5 and pstm6 were linearized with hindiii/ndei and
bamhi/ecori, respectively. both were transcribed with t7 rna polymerase (promega), producing probes of approximately 160 and 220
nucleotides, respectively. [32p]rctp-labeled crna-probes were synthesized as follows. three ml of 5 3 transcription buffer (promega) dithiothreitol (nuclease-free, sigma) to a concentration of 10 mm; ratp,
rgtp, and rutp (promega; final concentration, 400 mm each); and 60
mci of [32p]rctp were mixed in a siliconized eppendorf tube. diethyl
pyrocarbonate (sigma) -treated distilled h2o was added to give a total
volume of 15 ml. linearized plasmid template to a final concentration of
40 to 50 ng/ml, rnasin (20 units, promega), and t7-rna polymerase
(20 units, boehringer, mannheim) were added at the end. transcription
was done for 1 h at 37 °c. the crnas were purified by a preparative
acrylamide gel and recovered from the gel slices by incubation in cracking buffer (0.3 m nacl, 0.1 mm edta, 10 mm tris, ph 7.5) for 1 h at
room temperature and subsequent extraction and precipitation.
the rnase protection was done with the rnase protection kit from
boehringer mannheim. 10 mg of total rna was used from each tissue
with ;105 cpm of labeled probe, and hybridization was done overnight
at 50 °c. rnase digestion was done with  xxxg1963xxx  and rnase t1 at
37 °c for 1 h. one-half of the assays was analyzed on a 4% sequencing
gel.

in situ hybridization
tissues were removed from a decapitated chicken and treated as
described previously (38, 39), with one minor modification. after the
xylene steps, the tissues were transferred directly into melted paraplast
at 60 °c.
in vitro transcription in the presence of [35s]utp (.1000 ci mmol21,

amersham corp.) was done essentially as described above; 60 mci of
[35s]rutp were used instead of rctp. the final volume was 20 ml. after
the first hour of incubation, another aliquot of rna polymerase was
added, and the mixture was incubated for another hour. the template
was digested with dnase i to stop the reaction. all probes were purified
by sephadex g-50 columns, and sizes were controlled on an analytical
4% polyacryamide-urea gel.
some conditions of prehybridization, hybridization, and subsequent
washing (38, 39) were slightly modified. probe for hybridization was
diluted in hybridization buffer to a concentration of ;20,000 cpm ml21,
and 30 ml were applied per slide. dithiothreitol concentration in the
hybridization buffer was increased to 100 mm (40). stringent washes
were carried out at 55 °c in 0.5 3 ssc, 50% formamide, 10 mm dithiothreitol for 2 h.
results

cloning of a  xxxg469xxx  cdna fragment—in chicken, the cdna
sequences of the products of three out of the four ck genes are
known. in case of the  xxxg469xxx  isoform, only partial amino acid
sequences have been published. to amplify a cdna fragment
coding for this isoform, a pcr approach with degenerate oligonucleotides was chosen. as chicken  xxxg469xxx  is highly expressed
in adult brain (17), total rna from chicken brain was used in
a rt-pcr. this rt-pcr produced a fragment of 653 bp (fig.
1a), which was subcloned (clone ub11– 83) and sequenced.
comparison to the human, rat, and mouse mia-cks (19, 24, 41)
indicated that we had cloned a chicken  xxxg469xxx  fragment. the
levels of amino acid identity were around 89% for all of them.
a chicken brain lgt10 cdna library was screened with this
fragment to isolate the full-length cdna. out of this screening,
one clone, containing sequences coding for  xxxg469xxx , was purified to homogeneity, subcloned, and sequenced (ub15–9). this

the nucleotide sequence of chicken  xxxg469xxx  cdna is represented as a bar. the intron-exon boundaries are shown as vertical lines, and the vertical
numbers above represent the 59-ends of the exons. the 59- and 39-utrs are represented by open boxes, and the part coding for the leader peptide
is hatched. the filled black box outlines the exon that is conserved in all ck genes (see “discussion”). the fragment amplified in rt-pcr
(ub11– 83) is shown with the two degenerate oligonucleotides (boldface), used in the final amplification (also see “materials and methods”). the
cdna fragment isolated by library screening (ub15–9) and the extension in the direction of the 59-end obtained by race-rt-pcr (tw61–11) are
indicated as well. b, the organization of the chicken  xxxg469xxx  gene locus was derived from the analysis of three (gmia-64, -67, -72) of the six genomic
l clones. the localization of these three clones along the gene locus is indicated. clone 72 is rearranged at a sau3ai site in intron 7 as verified by
direct sequencing of the l clone. bamhi fragments of clone 72 were subcloned and sequenced in part (see sequencing strategy, indicated by arrows).
the region of the bamhi sites and of the 39-end of the gene were sequenced directly on the corresponding genomic l clones (indicated by thick bars
above the lines of the l clones). the sequencing strategy is shown by arrows, and intron 1 has not been sequenced in total as indicated. at the ends
of the genomic l-clones there are bamhi sites that probably are cloning artifacts from a mboi-bamhi fusion. at the 59-end of clone 67 is an
additional bamhi site. because clone 72 contains a upstream hindiii site, which in combination with the hindiii site in clones 64 and 67 gives
rise to the same hindiii fragment as the one found in genomic southern blots, it represents a faithful segment of the chicken  xxxg469xxx  locus. b,

fig. 2. partial sequence of the chicken  xxxg469xxx  gene. the sequences were determined as indicated in fig. 1 (arrows). the length of intron
1, which was not sequenced in total, was determined by analysis of restriction enzyme digests, and only part of the 1 kb that was sequenced is
shown. capital letters represent exon sequences, whereas lower case letters stand for intron and 39- and 59-flanking sequences of the gene. all
intron-exon boundaries were sequenced, and splice sites were identified in all cases (underlined; points refer to nucleotides that do not match the
consensus splice sequences). the polyadenylation signal is boxed. in the promoter region, the two gc boxes are underlined twice (a), and the
putative ap-2 binding sites are indicated by a single line above the sequence. the two potential e2a contact sites are shown by arrows below the
sequence and the mre-site by an arrow above. the derived amino acid sequence is indicated under the respective exon, and the mitochondrial
import signal is underlined. the numbering of the protein sequence starts with the first amino acid of the mature protein. thus the initiating
methionine is amino acid 239. the nucleotide sequence is not numbered with the exception of the region upstream of the atg. there are 120
nucleotides/full line, and every 10 nucleotides there are asterisks on top of the figure.

cdna sequence starts only 170 bp downstream of the atg
initiation codon (see figs. 1 and 2), reaches to the 39-end at
1383 bp of the mrna (see fig. 1a), but contains no poly(a) tail.
the race-rt-pcr method (31) is a way to amplify unknown
cdna ends, with the advantage of avoiding time-consuming
screening procedures. hence this method was used to verify the
39-end of the chicken  xxxg469xxx  cdna. in this experiment, a
poly(a) tail was found at the expected position. the polyadenylation signal sequence cataaa was identified 19 bp upstream

from the 39-end (see fig. 2, boxed nucleotides at the end). the
39-utr is 134 bp long, but it lacks the sequence similarities
observed by others (42) in the 39-utrs of human, rat, and
mouse mia-cks. for the chicken  xxxg469xxx , a message size of
approximately 1700 bp is observed in northern blot experiments (not shown). since poly(a) tails usually range between
100 and 200 bp, the  xxxg469xxx  cdna should have a length in the
range of 1500 bp. hence the missing sequence at the 59-end
might be 250 –350 bp long.

conservation of mi-ck genes and cdnas in mammals and birds

the race-rt-pcr method was also applied to amplify
these missing 59-terminal sequences. the largest extension
obtained from these experiments provided only 83 additional
bp compared with the cdna clone ub15–9 (fig. 1a). other
attempts, using strongly denaturing agents like methylmercuric hydroxide to melt possible secondary structure elements in
the rna, did not yield any further sequence information. the
method was working in our hands, as the missing 59-end of
chicken  xxxg470xxx  (15) was cloned at the same time. there we
obtained the remaining 57 bp of the coding region, and the 156
bp of the 59-utr (the complete sequence of the  xxxg470xxx  leader
peptide is given in fig. 5). thus at the 59-end of chicken miack, 200 –300 bp resisted cloning by cdna-based methods for
unknown reasons.
the missing sequences were finally obtained by analysis of
genomic l clones (see below). they code for the leader peptide
of 39 amino acids, necessary for import into mitochondria, and
the 59-utr, which we predict to have length of ;100 bp. the
whole cdna without poly(a) tail has therefore a length around
1480 bp.
reduced conservation of the chicken mi-ck leader peptides—as mentioned before, we have also cloned the missing
59-part of the chicken  xxxg470xxx  cdna, which encodes part of the
leader peptide necessary for import into mitochondria. together with the chicken  xxxg469xxx  sequence, we now have two
nonmammalian leader peptides available for analysis of function and evolutionary relationships. both leaders show the
typical tripartite structure of mitochondrial import sequences
(43). as can be seen in fig. 3, the mammalian mi-ck leader
peptides are highly conserved in a isoform-specific manner.
the leader peptides of mammalian mia-cks display amino acid
identities around 90%, and the same is true for the mib-cks

(fig. 3, table). if the chicken mi-cks are included in this
comparison, the values of identity are much lower, and the
isoform-specific conservation is no longer striking. the chicken
 xxxg469xxx  leader peptide shows identities to the ubiquitous micks between 56.4 and 61.5%, and the  xxxg470xxx  peptide is 54 and
59% identical to the mammalian sarcomeric mi-ck peptides.
these values are barely higher than those obtained in interisotype comparisons, which range from 38.5 to 51.3%.
the amino acids conserved in all of the leader peptides of
either the  xxxg469xxx  or the  xxxg470xxx  are, with one exception, also
conserved in the chicken mia- and mib-cks. preliminary expression studies done with the chicken  xxxg470xxx  cdna have
shown that the  xxxg470xxx  leader peptide is functional and that
 xxxg470xxx  gets imported into mitochondria of heterologous mammalian cv-1 cells.3
isolation of genomic  xxxg469xxx  sequences—to investigate the
structure and the putative regulatory elements of the chicken
 xxxg469xxx  gene, the ecori/smai cdna fragment of clone ub15–9
was taken to screen a chicken genomic l library. in four rounds
of screening, six of the initially 17 clones could be purified to
homogeneity. the clones were analyzed by southern blots using oligonucleotides from different regions of the known cdna
fragment. clone gmia 72, encompassing 12 kb, was chosen for
subcloning and further analysis. this clone contains about 5 kb
of sequences upstream of the atg, including the putative promoter region, and reaches as far toward the 39-end as into
intron 7. however, direct sequencing of the l-clone revealed a
rearrangement at the 39-end (see fig. 1b). the 39-region of the
gene was therefore directly sequenced on two other, not rearranged, l-clones (64 and 67 in fig. 1, thick black bars).
in total, close to 5.3 kb have been sequenced (fig. 2) including 500 – 600 bp of putative promoter region. about 300 bp of
promoter sequences further upstream were analyzed, but they
are only sequenced on one strand and therefore are not included. the nonsequenced part is located in intron 1. at the

10 mg of genomic dna each were digested with bamhi (lane 1), hindiii
(lane 2), and taqi (lane 3); the fragements were resolved on an agarosegel and transferred onto a nylon membrane. the first blot (a) was
hybridized to a 32p-labeled 319-bp cdna fragment (nucleotides 169 –
488 in fig. 1b; random prime labeling; specific activity, 109 cpm/mg) and
the second (b) to a 32p-labeled 63-bp cdna fragment (nucleotides 88 –
151 in fig. 1b; pcr labeling; specific activity, 4 3 109 cpm/mg). the
blots were exposed to an x-ray film for 2 days. the fragments of the
marker (a combination of phage l dna cut with ecori and hindiii and
phage l dna cut with bgli) are indicated in kb. the hybridization
pattern shows that there is a single gene and that the genomic l clones
contain hybridizing fragments of identical size.

fig. 5.  xxxg469xxx  mrna is not accumulated in all tissues of adult
chicken expressing  xxxg467xxx . rnase-protection experiments with 32plabeled crna-probes derived from the 39-regions of  xxxg467xxx  (a) and
 xxxg469xxx  (b) were performed as described under “materials and methods.” 5 mg of total rna from brain (2), leg muscle (3), heart (4), gut (5),
kidney (6), and testis (7) was used per lane. in lane 1, the undigested
probe was loaded (specific activity of the  xxxg467xxx  probe . 4.6 3 108
cpm/mg; specific activity of the  xxxg469xxx  probe . 6.3 3 108 cpm/mg). the
autoradiographs for  xxxg467xxx  and for  xxxg469xxx  were exposed for 12 h at room
temperature, except for the testis lane of section b, which is from a 24-h
exposure. u, undigested; p, protected.

tous mi-ck genes in introns or downstream of the gene. in
chicken, only some, possibly nonfunctional, half-sites for the
glucocorticoid response element are found in intronic regions.
there is only one  xxxg469xxx  gene—genomic southern blot
analysis, using high molecular weight genomic dna prepared
from chicken erythrocytes, was performed to verify the gene
structure and to rule out the possibility of pseudogenes as were
found for rat and human  xxxg467xxx  genes (21–23, 55).
the same 317-bp fragment used for the screening of the
genomic library was used as a probe and produced only one
signal per lane on a southern blot of dna digested with
bamhi, hindiii, and taqi (fig. 4a). the observed hybridizing
fragments were 8.5, 11, and 2.9 kb long, respectively, and are in
perfect agreement with the restriction map derived from the
genomic clones as shown in fig. 1b.
to further support the gene structure reported here, another
southern blot (fig. 4b) was hybridized with a 64-bp probe,
labeled by pcr, from the 59-end of the known cdna sequences
(nucleotides 88 –151 of the cdna depicted in fig. 1a; corresponding to part of exon 1). again the fragments of 1.1, 11, and
2.3 kb, respectively, were the same as those found in the
genomic l clones. these data therefore indicate that the
chicken  xxxg469xxx  gene is a single copy gene. additionally the
317- and 64-bp probes both hybridize in hindiii-digested dna
to a fragment of the same length of 11 kb. this shows that the
organization of the l clones correctly represents the genomic
locus.
expression pattern of the chicken  xxxg469xxx  in adult tissues—in mammals, the homologue of the chicken  xxxg469xxx  is
usually called ubiquitous mi-ck, thus implicating that is actively transcribed in all tissues. the expression of chicken
 xxxg469xxx  was investigated by rnase protection experiments on
total rna from various tissues of the adult chicken (see fig. 5).
probes specific for  xxxg469xxx  and, as positive control, for  xxxg467xxx ,
both derived from the 39-end of the corresponding cdnas (see
“materials and methods”), were used to test rna from brain,
leg muscle, heart, gut, kidney, and testis. this showed that
 xxxg469xxx  is highly expressed together with  xxxg467xxx  in brain and
gut but only weakly in testis. there was no detectable expres-

39-end, there are 83 bp of known sequence after the polyadenylation site. the chicken  xxxg469xxx  gene is approximately 7.6 kb
long and has nine exons. the defined exon sizes range from
86 –247 bp, but the putative exon 1 may be larger. intron 1 is
4.2 kb long, of which 1.2 kb were sequenced. all other introns
are rather small (,520 bp), giving rise to a compact gene
structure on the 39-side. analysis of the nucleotide sequences
around the intron-exon junctions (underlined in fig. 2) shows
that they correspond well to the ag-gt splice junction rule (44)
for intron-exon boundaries. the dots in the splice regions indicate deviations from the rule.
the 59-region of the chicken  xxxg469xxx  gene shows a high
gc-content. it is around 80% in the whole bamhi fragment
comprising exon 1 (see fig. 1b), and the same holds true for the
entire exon 1, regardless of the size of 59-utr proposed. the
three mammalian mia-cks (19, 24, 41) also have a higher
gc-content in the exon 1 region of the cdna, but it is 15%
below the content found in chicken. strong rna secondary
structures, as predicted by the stemloop program in the  xxxg873xxx 
software package (45, 46), are an additional feature of exon 1.
both the high gc content and the strong secondary rna structure prevented the mapping of the transcription start site of
the chicken  xxxg469xxx  gene (see figs. 1 and 2), although we tried
primer extension analysis and rnase- and s1-protection analysis. from the putative transcription factor binding sites found
(see below and fig. 2), a transcription start site about 100 bp
upstream of the atg initiation codon seems most likely. alternatively an additional, untranslated exon might exist, but in
the sequences upstream of the atg there was no indication of
a further splice site. therefore it is highly probable that exon 1
is in fact the first exon and that transcription initiates about
100 bp upstream of the atg.
analysis of the chicken  xxxg469xxx  gene with the grail software
(47) predicts, around exon 1 (see fig. 1 and 2), a cpg island
with a very high cpg score of 0.98 (for definition of this score,
see ref. 48). the island starts at 2587 bp upstream of the atg
and extends to 1506 bp downstream. the human  xxxg469xxx  gene
also has such a cpg island from 2198 to 1236 bp, with a score
of 0.73. in both cases, it has to be investigated if these islands
are undermethylated, but their presence in the promoter regions is of interest in the context of their regulation. a lot of
so-called housekeeping genes (49) or tissue-specific genes with
a broad range of expression (50) do have such cpg islands. in
addition, these genes usually lack tataa and ccaat boxes.
the putative promoter region of the chicken  xxxg469xxx  gene fulfills all of these features and is typical for such a gene type. a
search for specific potential binding sites for transcription factors upstream from the atg revealed, among many sp1 sites
(14 on the upper strand), two gc boxes that match the consensus defined by kadonaga et al. (51) and are marked with a
double line in fig. 2. further potential binding sites were found
for the general factor ap2 (single lines above the sequence)
matching the consensus sequence 59-cccmnsss-39 (52) for
the ubiquitously expressed products of the e2a gene (59gcaggtggc-39, arrows below the sequence) and for a metal
response element (mre, at 282 bp, arrow above), which is
identical to the mrea element in the mouse metallothionein-i
gene promoter (53). suzuki and co-workers (54) have identified
three sequence elements (mt1, mt3, and mt4) common in the
59-flanking regions of nuclear genes coding for mitochondrial
proteins. the same three stretches are also found in human
sarcomeric and mouse ubiquitous mi-ck. however, none of
these “mitochondria-related” binding sites is found in the sequenced upstream region of the chicken  xxxg469xxx , although they
might be located further upstream. glucocorticoid and estrogen
response elements were reported in mouse and human ubiqui-

sion in other tissues. usually the level of  xxxg467xxx  expression was
higher than that of  xxxg469xxx , with the exception of gut, where
the inverse was true.
because it is possible that small groups of cells express
 xxxg469xxx  even in tissues where no expression in whole tissue
rna was detected, in situ hybridizations were performed. paraffin sections from spinal cord, liver, gizzard, and gut were
hybridized with the same probes but labeled with 35s. there
was no hybridization in liver either for b- or for  xxxg469xxx  mrna
(fig. 6, a–c), and  xxxg467xxx  was the only ck present in the smooth
muscle portion of the gizzard (fig. 6k).
in gut, the signal of the  xxxg467xxx  probe was localized over the
longitudinal and circular smooth muscle tissue. the  xxxg467xxx 
probe hybridized to the base of the villi and a diminishing
signal was detected toward the luminal region. there is also
hybridization in a ring just inside the smooth muscle layer,
which represents the muscularis mucosae. the hybridization to
the muscle tissue seems stronger than in the villi.  xxxg469xxx  was
restricted to villi and showed no expression in the surrounding
smooth muscle tissue (fig. 6, g–i).
finally, in spinal cord,  xxxg469xxx  showed a punctuated hybridization pattern, which localized over the cell bodies of neurons
of the gray matter; there it is expressed together with  xxxg467xxx . in
other cells, only unspecific hybridization was observed. on the
other hand,  xxxg467xxx  hybridizes at a lower level in gray as well as
in white matter (fig. 6, d–f) and seems not to be restricted to
neuronal cells.
discussion

recently several reports described mi-ck amino acid sequences and the corresponding gene structures of mammalian
mi-ck genes, and regulatory and evolutionary aspects of the
mi-cks were proposed (20, 24, 25, 54). among the nonmammalian species, the chicken ck isoenzyme family has already
been well documented (2, 10, 11, 57– 60) with the exception of

the fourth gene,  xxxg469xxx . here we present the chicken  xxxg469xxx 
amino acid sequence derived from the cdna as well as the
structure of the corresponding gene. the analysis of the
chicken system and its comparison with the mammalian ck
set allows conclusions to be drawn on functional elements of
the protein, like the leader segment, on regulatory properties of
the chicken  xxxg469xxx  promoter leading to regulated expression,
as well as on evolution of the ck isoforms.
an amino acids sequence comparison (20) of the creatine
kinase isoenzymes has shown that the proteins can be arranged into six different groups based on their levels of sequence identities. two groups consist of the cytosolic cks of the
fishes/amphibians (see ref. 20) and will not be further discussed, while the other four groups are formed by the different
isoforms of mammals and birds. the nine exons of the mia-ckgene give rise to a precursor protein of 417 amino acids, including an amino-terminal mitochondrial import sequence of 39
amino acids. the mature chicken  xxxg469xxx  fits in the comparison
into the group of the mia-cks or ubiquitous mi-cks. the levels
of identities between the ubiquitous mi-cks known so far are
around 90% for the mature protein as shown in fig. 3b.
in addition, an isotype-specific conservation of the leader
peptides was noted for mammalian mi-cks, and hence it was
suggested that these peptides might act as isoprotein-specific
import sequences or bind to specific import receptors (19). the
observed low identities with the chicken leader peptides (fig.
3b) are not in favor to extend this hypothesis also to nonmammalian isoforms, unless the isoprotein-specifically conserved
residues found between chicken and mammalian leader peptides (amino acid positions 10, 11, 18, 23–25, 27, 28, and 30)
were sufficient to ensure the specific import (fig. 3b). in contrast to the leader peptides, the mature protein mia- and
 xxxg470xxx  sequences are conserved isoform-specifically to a degree of almost 90%, and no segments can be found in the

fig. 6.  xxxg469xxx  is not localized in smooth muscle tissues of gut and gizzard.  xxxg469xxx  and  xxxg467xxx  mrna was localized in liver, spinal cord,
gut, and gizzard by in situ hybridization with the same, but 35s-labeled crna probes as in the rnase-protection experiment (fig. 5). sections were
from liver (a–c), spinal cord (thoracic vertebrae; d–f), gut (g–i), and gizzard (j–l). a, d, g, and j, bright field micrographs; b, e, h, and k, dark
field micrographs of sections hybridized with the  xxxg467xxx  specific probe; c, f, i, and l, dark field micrographs of sections hybridized with the
 xxxg469xxx -specific probe. in the three consecutive liver sections shown, the folds in the tissue are due to sectioning artifacts. the folds led to false
hybridization signals because of trapping of the probe. the arrows in micrographs h and i give the position of the muscularis mucosae. the level
of  xxxg469xxx  hybridization in the spinal cord (f) is low on the outside of the neuronal cell bodies, and comparison to the negative control (not shown)

mature proteins where the conservation drops to the low levels
of the leader peptides. hence, the reduced conservation of the
leader peptides cannot be explained by the greater phylogenetic distance of the chicken from mammals since leader peptide and mature proteins must have undergone simultaneous
evolution. the noted high homologies in the mammalian peptides are therefore a mere fact of their phylogenetic closeness,
and the apparent lower evolutionary pressure for conservation
of the leader peptides is only observed when the large evolutionary gap, as the one between mammals and birds, is analyzed. thus, it is unlikely that the conservation of the mammalian mi-ck leader peptides represent isoform-specific
functions. this is supported by the observed import of the
chicken  xxxg470xxx  into the mitochondria of mammalian fibroblastic cv-1 cells, where endogenous  xxxg469xxx , but no  xxxg470xxx , can
be expected.
on the level of the nucleotide sequences, 78% identity is
observed if the mature chicken  xxxg469xxx  is compared with any of
the mammalian ubiquitous mi-cks. as conservation on the
protein level with 90% is much higher, nucleotide changes
occur therefore mainly at wobble positions. the same holds
true for the mib-cks or any of the cytosolic cks. in case of the
utrs, the situation is different. cheng et al. (42) have shown
that a sequence in the 39-utr of the rat ubiquitous mi-ck is
involved in regulation of its expression/translation. whereas
this sequence stretch of 72 bp is conserved in the mouse and the
human sequence, it cannot be found in chicken  xxxg469xxx , suggesting that this mechanism of regulation is not active in
chicken.
a schematic representation comparing the four known
mi-ck genes is given in fig. 7. the organization of the chicken
gene is similar to the two other known  xxxg469xxx  genes from man
and mouse. the localization of intron-exon boundaries in the
coding region of the cdna and the exon-sizes (except number 1)
are conserved between these genes. in addition, the chicken
gene lacks a noncoding first exon, like the mammalian ubiquitous mi-cks but contrary to all other known ck genes.
whereas the mouse and the human genes show a common
bipartite gene structure with a clustering into the goups of
exons 1– 6 and 7–9 (41), in chicken  xxxg469xxx , exon 1 is separated
from the compact rest of the gene by a rather large intron. the

sarcomeric mi-ck gene, although it is with 37 kb the largest
mi-ck gene known so far and in addition has two noncoding
first exons, has exon intron boundaries at the same positions of
the coding region as the ones noticed in the ubiquitous mi-ck
genes (see fig. 7). hence, the two gene types might have
evolved by a gene duplication event.
as noted earlier (25) the mitochondrial ck gene structure is
different from that of the cytosolic cks. there is only one exon
(exon 6, respectively exon 8 in human sarcomeric mi-ck) that
is conserved through all of the cks in its size and localization
in the coding region (black exon in fig. 7). other features, for
instance the conserved 59-noncoding exon in case of the cytosolic ck genes, are not found in the mi-ck genes. interestingly
the region of the conserved exon is also the exon with the
highest homology at the amino acid level among the different
guanidino kinases (20). this might indicate a critical role of
these residues for the structure and function of guanidino
kinases, as has already been shown for a  xxxd3454xxx  residue
in this region (62).
all of the data mentioned so far show that the cks form a
group of evolutionarily related isoenzymes and can further be
embedded into the larger family of the guanidino kinases. the
four different ck isoforms most probably evolved by three gene
duplication events, with the first of these producing a primordial cytosolic and a primordial mitochondrial isoform. the phylogenetic tree, which can be derived from the protein comparison (20), suggests this first duplication to have occurred before
the separation of the echinoderms from chordates, which is in
agreement with published data on the expression of mi-cks in
sea urchins (63, 64). the significant homology, still found if the
protein comparison of the cks is extended to other guanidino
kinases like argk or  xxxd2244xxx  kinase, is a strong indication for a common ancestor of the guanidino kinases. argk
has been suggested to be this ancestor on the basis of data on
its dimerization capacity with cytosolic cks, the nature of its
substrate arginine as being part of basic metabolism, and especially from the distribution of arginine and argk in the
animal kingdom (1). however, creatine has been found in
sperm of many nonvertebrate taxa as well (1, 65). taking into
account that the recently cloned  xxxd2244xxx  kinase
shows higher homology to cks than to argks (56), it can be

other known mi-ck genes of human and mouse (24, 25, 41). the exon sizes are not drawn to scale, but for any given gene, they are proportional
in size. the coloring of exons is as mentioned in fig. 1. the sizes of the genes are indicated below the names in kb; due to its large size, the scale
of human sarcomeric mi-ck is much smaller as indicated by the scale bar. the numbers below the chicken gene refer to the nucleotide positions
of the intron exon boundaries in the chicken  xxxg469xxx  cdna. as the mammalian mi-cks have one amino acid more in their exon 1, the corresponding
numbers have to be increased by three (153, 352, and so on). the numbers to the right indicate the 39-end of the cdnas without the poly(a) tail.

suggested that a duplication event has first produced a  xxxd2244xxx  kinase and argk and that later ck has evolved
from  xxxd2244xxx  kinase.
the promoter region of chicken  xxxg469xxx  is rather similar to
those of the human and mouse genes and displays all of the
features attributed to housekeeping genes (49) or tissue-specific genes with a broad range of expression (50). it is at present
not known whether any of the transcription factor binding sites
identified by sequence analysis are actually used for the regulation of the chicken  xxxg469xxx  gene. during rat pregnancy,  xxxg467xxx 
as well as ubiquitous mi-ck ( xxxg469xxx ), are regulated in rat
uterus by steroid hormones, and binding sites for steroid receptors are expected. however, in the chicken  xxxg469xxx  gene, no
such sites have been identified, and only possibly nonfunctional
half-sites for glucocorticoid receptors have been found. on the
other hand, it has been shown for rat  xxxg467xxx  that the regulation
is independent of the binding of an  xxxg730xxx  to the
promoter region (66). the three binding sites mt1, mt3, and
mt4 (54) identified in nuclear genes coding for mitochondrial
proteins have also been found in the mouse ubiquitous mi-ck
gene. these sites are present neither in the chicken nor the
human gene, but in both cases the known 59-located sequences
may be to short to contain these sequences. summarizing the
data shown, the  xxxg469xxx  gene displays in part the same regulatory elements found in mouse and human. some of the additional elements reported especially in mouse are not found in
the chicken  xxxg469xxx  gene, probably due to the limited sequence
information at the 59-end. the “missing” binding sites might,
however, be important to explain the observed restricted expression pattern found for chicken  xxxg469xxx .
the presence of  xxxg469xxx  in brain tissues is already well
documented (2, 60). our localization in spinal cord shows that
 xxxg469xxx  is coexpressed with  xxxg467xxx  in the cell bodies of neural
cells of the gray matter but is absent from any other region
where only  xxxg467xxx  is found. hence, neurons seem to rely on a
functional pcr shuttle in spinal cord. whereas other investigators reported minute ck expression in liver, our in situ
hybridizations show no  xxxg469xxx  or  xxxg467xxx  expression in general.
either the transcripts are below detection limit or not present
at all. the smooth muscle-containing tissues analyzed by in
situ hybridization do not express  xxxg469xxx  in their smooth muscle portions, but they display considerable amounts of  xxxg467xxx .
hence, gut (duodenum) and gizzard smooth muscle in chicken
function in the absence of mi-ck, which is different from vascular and intestinal smooth muscle of guinea pig (8) or smooth
muscle from rat (42). for chicken gizzard, the lack of  xxxg469xxx  is
due to its peculiar contractile properties (60). whether this
holds true for chicken gut as well is not known. the only
portion in gut expressing  xxxg469xxx  is the border region of the
villi, which suggests that a functional pcr circuit might be
important for cells of the brush border involved in resorption
processes. these data show that  xxxg469xxx  expression in tissues
of adult chicken is more restricted than that of  xxxg467xxx . they
indicate that the name ubiquitous, given to the mammalian
mia-cks, is not justifiable in chicken. the features of the
 xxxg469xxx  promoter indicating a housekeeping gene are misleading, and there must be other regulatory elements narrowing its
expression. the putative additional regulatory elements will
have to determined by future research.
