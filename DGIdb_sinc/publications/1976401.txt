in vitro inhibition of intestinal motility by
phenylethanolaminotetralines: evidence of atypical
fl-adrenoceptors in rat colon
'alberto bianchetti & luciano manara
research center sanofi-midy s.p.a., via g.b. piranesi, 38, 20137 milan, italy
1 the new compounds phenylethanolaminotetralines (peat), unlike the reference ,b-adrenoceptor agonists  xxxd2398xxx  (iso),  xxxd3130xxx  (ri) and salbutamol (sal), produced half-maximal inhibition of spontaneous motility of rat isolated proximal colon at substantially lower concentrations (ec50 2.7-30nm) than
those inducing f2-adrenoceptor-mediated responses (relaxation of guinea-pig isolated trachea and rat
uterus) and had virtually no chronotropic action (ec50 > 3 x 10- m) on the guinea-pig isolated atrium
(a f1-adrenoceptor-mediated response).
2 the nonselective f-adrenoceptor antagonists  xxxd123xxx  and propranolol prevented the inhibition of
rat colon motility by the peat with low and different potencies (pa2 values around 7.5 and 6.5
respectively). conversely  xxxd123xxx  and propranolol had a higher and similar potency (pa2 values around
9.0) in preventing typical f6l- or f2-responses (increase in atrial frequency by iso or tracheal relaxation by
ri or sal).
3 the selective 8-adrenoceptor antagonists cgp 20712a (#k) and ici 118,551 (82) either alone or in
combination, did not prevent rat colon motility inhibition by the representative peat sr 5861 ia, which
was also fully resistant to a-adrenoceptor, acetylcholine, dopamine, histamine, opioid and 5hydroxytryptamine antagonists.
4 these results indicate that the peat are a new class of fi-adrenoceptor agonists and suggest that their
preferential intestinal action may be accounted for by selectivity for atypical fl-adrenoceptors, abundant in
the rat colon and distinct from the currently recognized 1i and  xxxd752xxx  subtypes.

introduction

methods

the important physiological role of local intestinal adrenergic
mechanisms in reducing gut motility is well established, as discussed in several reviews (furness & costa, 1974; burnstock
& wong, 1981; daniel, 1982; bulbring & tomita, 1987) and
substantial clinical evidence (petri et al., 1971; neely & catchpole, 1971; rees et al., 1980; o'brien et al., 1985; lyrenas et
al., 1985; lyrenas & abrahamsson, 1986) supports the potential of this finding for developing pharmacological means for
therapeutic applications. however, even the best tolerated
#2-selective adrenoceptor agonists, which otherwise seem
promising for treating conditions of abnormally enhanced
gastrointestinal motility (lyrenas et al., 1985; lyrenas &
abrahamsson, 1986), are not recommended for therapy
because of their unacceptable concurrent cardiovascular
effects (lyrenas et al., 1985).
on these grounds, we engaged in a search for gut-specific
sympathomimetic agents. we have preliminarily described the
relative in vitro intestinal specificity of the new putative f0adrenoceptor agonists phenylethanolaminotetralines (peat),
which had no chronotropic action on the guinea-pig atrium
and were considerably more potent in reducing spontaneous
motility of the isolated proximal colon of the rat than in relaxing the guinea-pig trachea (croci et al., 1987; 1988a). in vivo
studies in the rat have shown that the peat, unlike currently
available f-adrenoceptor agonists, reduce large intestine
motility at doses with no effect on the cardiovascular system
(croci et al., 1989; giudice et al., 1989).
this paper discusses in detail the nature of the in vitro
action of peat and the possibility that atypical f6adrenoceptors abundant in the proximal colon of the rat and
distinct from the currently recognized fi1 and 92 subtypes may
account for the relative intestinal specificity of these new

all the isolated preparations, from rats crl: cd(sd)br
charles river (250-350g) of either sex or male dh iffacredo guinea-pigs (500-700g), were set up in appropriate
solutions (containing 200,pgml-'  xxxd228xxx ) in a 20ml
organ bath maintained at 370c and aerated with 95% 02, 5%
co2 unless otherwise specified.
the first 3cm segment of the rat proximal colon, starting
from the ileo-caecal junction, was mounted longitudinally in
krebs-ringer solution with composition identical to that
described by ek et al. (1986a). spontaneous motility (rhythmic
phasic contractions) was recorded isotonically under a constant load of 1 g (see figure 1) in the presence of 1o pm  xxxd2914xxx , 0.5 pm desmethylimipramine and 301#m
hydrocortisone hemisuccinate to block respectively areceptors and neuronal and extraneuronal catecholamine
uptake, as suggested for other isolated preparations by
kenakin (1984).  xxxd2914xxx  renders the preparation about
ten times more sensitive to the peat and to reference /?adrenoceptor agonists and this accounts for a higher ec50
than we obtained previously in its absence (croci et al., 1987;
1988a; bianchetti et al., 1988).
quantitative computer analysis was based on a motility
index consisting of the area under the pressure waves over a
10min period. only one agonist concentration was tested on
each preparation either with or without one concentration of
antagonist added 30min before. in some experiments,  xxxd2388xxx 
and tetrodotoxin, were added to the organ bath 30min before
the agonist.
guinea-pig spontaneously beating right atria were set up in
krebs solution maintained at 30°c (o'donnell & wanstall,
1974) and preincubated (30 min) with 12,pm phenoxybenzamine before addition of the tested compounds by the cumulative method with appropriate log-concentration increments
(contact time for each dose 2.5 min); responses were expressed
as a percentage of the maximal response. for studying

agents.

antagonists (and for calculating pa2 values), concentrationresponse curves for the agonist in the absence or presence of
one concentration of antagonist, added 30min before, were
obtained in the same preparation.
guinea-pig tracheal chains, prepared as described by
o'donnell & wanstall (1974), were set up in krebs solution
and preincubated (30min) with 12pm phenoxybenzamine
before the addition of the tested compounds by logconcentration increments; only one cumulative concentrationresponse curve was obtained in each preparation.
drug-induced relaxation was recorded isotonically under a
constant load of 0.5g. the contact time between doses was
5min or longer until the effect reached a steady state; the
shorter contact time we had used in earlier experiments
(2.5 min) resulted in lower potencies for several agonists (croci
et al., 1987; 1988a) than those given in this paper. for studying antagonists, tracheal chains from the same animal were
mounted in pairs and cumulative concentration-response
curves for the agonist with or without one concentration of
antagonist (contact time 30 min) were compared directly in the
two preparations.
uterine horns from unprimed oestrus rats were set up in
locke solution aerated with 100% 02 (levy & tozzi, 1963)
and preincubated (30min) with 12pam phenoxybenzamine
before addition of the tested drugs. spontaneous contractions
were recorded isotonically under a constant load of 1 g. only
one agonist concentration was tested on each preparation and
allowed to act for at least 5 min. activity was expressed as the
percentage reduction of the amplitude of contractions.
concentrations of agonists inducing tracheal relaxation or
increasing atrial frequency by 50% over the basal value (ecjo)
were extrapolated from cumulative log-concentrationresponse curves obtained by the least squares method. in the
other preparations (rat colon and uterus) the ec30
(concentrations of agonists reducing spontaneous contractions
by 50%) were obtained from log-concentration response
curves built up by averaging the individual responses in each
preparation.
pa2 values for antagonists, as defined by arunlakshana &
schild (1959), were obtained from constrained plots (best
straight line with a slope of unity) of log (dr - 1) vs negative
log[antagonist] according to mackay (1978). fitting of the
experimental data to a theoretical schild plot (slope not significantly different from unity), by use of four different concentrations of antagonists was preliminarily assessed. computer
analysis was carried out as described by tallarida & murray
(1987). antagonism of responses to iso by propranolol, which
did not fit a simple linear schild plot with a slope of unity,
was analysed by a non-linear fitting programme (sacchi landriani et al., 1983) by applying a model for the interaction of

competitive antagonists with two receptor sites according to
lemoine & kaumann (1983).
the phenylethanolaminotetralines (peat), whose structures and isomers with appropriate code numbers are presented in table 1, were synthesized in the chemistry section of
the sanofi-midy s.p.a. research center. synthesis was

results
spontaneous motility of the rat isolated proximal colon was
reduced concentration-dependently by reference adrenoceptor
agonists and by peat as illustrated by the representative
recordings in figure 1 and by the log concentration-response
curves in figure 2a. the peat and reference compounds
were also tested in range of concentrations on the guinea-pig
atrium, rat uterus and guinea-pig trachea (figure 2b, c and d).
the potencies of the compounds tested in relaxing the rat
colon in vitro and in generating presumably fl-adrenoceptormediated responses in the other isolated preparations are
shown in table 2. the nonselective f-adrenoceptor agonist
iso and the f2 selective sal were the most and the least potent

(ec5o 1.5 nm and 285 nm) on the rat isolated colon. in the
same preparation thefl2 selective adrenoceptor agonists ri,
ad, na and the peat had intermediate potencies, sr
5861 1a being only about two times less potent than iso (ec5o
3.5 nm).
in the guinea-pig isolated atrium, the peat were inactive
and ri had only scant activity at micromolar concentrations;
iso, na, ad and sal were only four to five times less potent in
increasing guinea-pig atrial frequency than in relaxing the rat
colon. iso, ad and sal were the most potent in relaxing the rat
isolated uterus; ri, na and the peat were substantially less
potent in this preparation. sr 58375a and ri were roughly
equally potent in the uterus and in the colon. sr 58572a and
sr 5861 1a, like na, were less active in relaxing the uterus
than the colon, in contrast to iso, ad and sal which were all
more potent in the uterus than in the colon. iso, ad, sal, na
and to a slightly less extent ri (intrinsic activity relative to
iso: 0.85), fully relaxed the guinea-pig isolated trachea. iso

and na relaxed guinea-pig trachea at concentrations similar
to those inhibiting rat colonic motility, whereas a lower concentration of ad and sal (about three and 20 times
respectively) and five times more ri than in the rat colon were
needed to elicit comparable effects in the guinea-pig trachea.
all the peat were substantially less effective in the guineapig trachea than in the rat colon and even at the highest concentrations tested failed to produce full tracheal relaxation
like that observed with the reference adrenoceptor agonists
(i.e. in the trachea the peat behaved as weak partial
agonists).
as shown in' table 3, the action of iso on the rat isolated
colon, rat uterus and guinea-pig atrium was stereospecific, the
(-)isomer being about 56, 116 and 26 times more potent
respectively than the (+ )-isomer. the peat too had
configuration-dependent action on the same isolated preparations. this was unequivocal in the case of the phenol compounds sr 58372, sr 58373a, sr 58374 and sr 58375a, the

rr isomer being more potent than its rs diastereoisomer and
the sr and ss isomers being virtually inactive. the  xxxd24xxx  compounds showed similar configuration-related
potency differences, though less pronounced between the rr
compound sr 58572a and its diastereoisomer sr 58589.
there was a notable exception as far as the chlorophenoxy
compounds were concerned. the rr isomer sr 58621a and
its diastereoisomer sr 5861 1a were virtually equipotent on
the rat colon, although the former was still about eight times
more potent than the latter on the uterus.
the data on the quantitative antagonism by  xxxd123xxx  and
propranolol of the action of the representative peat sr
58375a and sr 5861 1a and of reference fi-adrenoceptor
agents on the rat colon are set out in table 4. antagonism
with  xxxd123xxx  was competitive, and roughly equipotent, as
shown by the similarity of the pa2 values (from 7.0 to 7.6),
regardless of whether the reference fl-adrenoceptor agonists or
the peat were those selected for inhibiting rat colon motility.
however,  xxxd123xxx  was substantially less potent in antagonizing rat colonic motility inhibition by either the reference
agonists or the peat than in preventing other reputedly
typical fil- or /32-adrenoceptor-mediated responses, such as
atrial frequency increase by iso or tracheal relaxation by ri or
sal. propranolol antagonized the inhibition of rat colon
motility by peat and ri (competitively) and by iso
(noncompetitively), but with lower potency (pa2 values 6.3 to
6.5) than  xxxd123xxx . the pa2 values of  xxxd123xxx  and propranolol versus iso, ri and sal in either the guinea-pig atria or
trachea were virtually identical and consistently higher (range
8.7-9.1) than in the rat colon (table 4). although the antagonism of iso by propranolol in the rat colon was not compatible with a simple competitive action (schild plot slope

different from one), the experimental data were fitted by a
nonlinear function made up of two lines of slope 1.0 joined by
an inflection according to a model for two classes of receptor
subtypes, which yielded apparent pa2 values of 8.5 and 6.2
(see legend to table 4).
we compared the action of nonselective ( xxxd123xxx ),
reputedly 161-selective (cgp 20712a) (dooley et al., 1986) and
f82-selective (ici 118,551) (o'donnell & wanstall, 1980) adrenoceptor antagonists on the inhibition of rat colon motility by
the representative peat sr 5861 ia and by reference agonists
(figure 3). motility inhibition by iso was reduced by all these
antagonists (figure 3a), whereas inhibition by sr 58611a
which responded to  xxxd123xxx , in agreement with the experiments presented in table 4, was completely refractory to cgp
20712a and to ici 118,551, alone or in combination (figure
3d). both  xxxd123xxx  and cgp 20712a antagonized na whose
inhibition of colonic motility was not affected by ici 118,551
(figure 3b). sal was antagonized by  xxxd123xxx  and ici
118,551, but not by cgp 20712a (figure 3c).
data not set out in tables or figures showed that the
potency (ec50nm and 95% confidence limits) of the representative peat sr 58611a in inhibiting rat colon motility,
i.e. 3.5 (2.6-4.7), was not significantly affected by the presence
in the organ bath (which always contained the o-adrenoceptor
blocking agent  xxxd2914xxx ) of any of various antagonists
including  xxxd2621xxx ,  xxxd1708xxx ,  xxxd1927xxx , spiperone,
atropine,  xxxd3050xxx , ranitidine and naloxone, ec5o: 3.6

5.3 (4.0-6.0), 3.3 (2.5-4.4), 5.7 (4.7-6.9) in the given order. only
the nonselective fi-adrenoceptor antagonists  xxxd123xxx 
(10- 6m) and propranolol (3 x 10-6 m) caused respectively an
8 and 11 fold elevation of the ec5o for rat colon motility inhi-

discussion
this study shows that the peat are potent inhibitors of rat
proximal colon motility through a f-adrenoceptor-mediated
mechanism that is hard to define in terms of the generally
recognized fi1- and p2-receptor subclassification (lands et al.,
1967).
we preliminarily found that compounds of this class, with
no chronotropic action on the guinea-pig atrium, were more
potent in reducing spontaneous motility of the rat isolated
proximal colon than in relaxing the guinea-pig trachea and
suggested that their colonic action might be accounted for by
selective stimulation of gut-located atypical fl-adrenoceptors
distinct from the currently defined al, and 62 subtypes
(bianchetti et al., 1987; croci et al., 1987; 1988a). this view is
further supported by the present results with newer and more
selective peat and several established adrenoceptor agonists
and antagonists.
all the peat inhibited rat proximal colon motility by
reducing both the frequency and the amplitude of the rhythmic phasic contractions. the importance of the chiral carbon
of the ethanolamine moiety was apparent from the substantially higher inhibitory potency of the rs and rr isomers
than the corresponding sr and ss enantiomers. the
configuration-dependent activity of peat also indicated that
a receptor-mediated event is involved. the potent and most
selective compound sr 5861 la was chosen as representative
of the class to study the mechanism of its intestinal inhibition.
a first line of evidence attests unequivocally to the fiadrenoceptor nature of the mechanism of the effect of peat
on gut motility. the colonic effects of sr 58611a were competitively antagonized by the nonselective /1-adrenoceptor
antagonists, propranolol and  xxxd123xxx ; the latter, as shown
previously (manara et al., 1989a), failed to antagonize relaxation of the rat colon by the calcium channel blocker verapamil, thus attesting to the specificity of the antagonism on sr
5861 1a. colonic inhibition by sr 5861 1a was refractory to
addition to the organ baths of various agents affecting specific
receptors and/or endogenous mediators. it is therefore
unlikely that xc-adrenoceptors, h1 or h2 histamine, 5hydroxytryptamine, acetylcholine, dopamine or opioid receptors are responsible for the peat intestinal actions.
incidentally, indomethacin potentiated rather than antagonized the action of sr 5861 1a, indicating that prostanoid synthesis, which accompanies stimulation of p6-receptors in some
isolated preparations (omini et al., 1981), somehow interfered
with the effects of peat on rat colon.

compounds that increase intracellular  xxxd1773xxx  levels,
like the phosphodiesterase inhibitor,  xxxd2388xxx , which at suitable
concentrations potentiates adenylate cyclase-dependent
responses, are often used to probe fi-adrenoceptor-mediated
effects (korth, 1978). in the rat isolated colon,  xxxd2388xxx  shifted
the log-concentration-response curve of sr 58611a to the left
and significantly lowered the ec50 for motility inhibition. a
comparable potentiation by  xxxd2388xxx  occurred with iso but not
with the calcium antagonist verapamil, suggesting that sr
58611a, like iso, affects motility by stimulating an
adenylcyclase-coupled fi-adrenoceptor.
additional evidence for the 8-adrenoceptor-agonist nature
of the peat comes from their ability to recognize presumably
specific binding sites in rat colon membranes labelled in vitro
with [3h]-dihydroalprenolol. we have previously shown that
several peat, including sr 5861 1a, displace [3h]-dihydroalprenolol with different potencies, to some extent reflecting
their respective abilities to induce colon motility inhibition
(manara et al., 1989b) which, however, is substantial at two
orders of magnitude lower concentrations than those effective
in the binding assay.
any further interpretation of the peat mechanism of
action on the rat colon as a result of stimulation of either filor f62-adrenoceptor subtypes, or both, is open to question.
the rank order of potency of the reference adrenoceptor
agonists on rat colon (iso > na = ad > ri > sal) was
similar to that on guinea-pig atrium (iso > na>
ad > sal > ri) but quite different from that on rat uterus
(iso > ad > sal > ri 2 na) or guinea-pig trachea (iso >
ad > sal > na > ri). this suggests that stimulation of flyrather than  xxxd752xxx -receptor subtypes may determine colonic
motility inhibition. the peat, however, do not fit into this
scheme because, in spite of their substantial potency on the rat
colon, they had no effect on guinea-pig atrial frequency (i.e. on
fl1-receptors). the peat were also generally weak agonists at
 xxxd752xxx -receptors as apparent from their relatively low potency on
rat uterus, which displays efficient coupling between stimulus
and tissue response (kenakin, 1982), and their low intrinsic

activity on guinea-pig trachea, a preparation containing
mainly fi2-receptors (o'donnell & wanstall, 1979). this
profile of mixed agonist-antagonist activity at 42-receptors
presumably accounts for the above mentioned ability of the
peat to displace [3h]-dihydroalprenolol from rat colon
binding sites, whose 82 nature appears predominant in the
light of the high displacing potency of the selective f02 antagonist ici 118,551 and the virtual inactivity of the selective l
antagonist cgp 20712a (manara et al., 1989b).
one may argue that bioavailability factors, such as different
penetration into the microenvironment surrounding receptor
sites, might explain the colon vs uterus selectivity of the
peat. this explanation appears unlikely in view of the different selectivity ratios (ec5o uterus:colon) of sr 58611a and
sr 58825a, 143 and 7.8 respectively. these two compounds
are in fact enantiomers which, in view of their identical
physico-chemical properties, cannot be expected to differ in
distribution between tissue compartments. metabolic factors
such as possible hydrolysis of sr 58611a and sr 58612a to
their corresponding acids by esterases specifically located in
rat colon might account for their preferential actions on this
preparation. however, the colon selectivity of chlorophenolic
compounds like sr 58572a, as well as the difference in selectivity between the diastereoisomers sr 58611a and sr
58612a, which presumably are equally susceptible to the
action of esterases, both argue against this.
identification of receptor types based on agonist responses
in different tissues has inherent shortcomings: agonist action
depends on both receptor affinity and efficacy and the lack of
specificity of some agonists may derive from multiple actions
on different preparations. therefore compounds which are
assumed to be receptor-selective may be merely tissueselective (kenakin, 1984). specific antagonists selective for any
given receptor subtype are more dependable than agonists as
regards receptor characterization. in the present study both

the reputedly highly selective adrenoceptor antagonists cgp
20712a, fir, and ici 118,551, 2, prevented the colonic effects
of iso; cgp 20712a antagonized the action on the colon of
na and ici 118,551 that of sal, but neither of these antagonists reduced the inhibition of colonic motility by sr 5861 la.
the intestinal inhibition by sr 58611a, like that by the other
representative peat sr 58375a, was antagonized competitively by the nonselective f-adrenoceptor blockers  xxxd123xxx 
and propranolol but, interestingly enough, with different
potencies.  xxxd123xxx  was more potent on the rat colon
although, as expected, both agents had virtually the same
(higher) potency in the prevention of typical fll- or
#l2-responses to appropriate reference agonists (iso, guinea-pig
atrium; ri or sal, trachea). these results are strongly consistent with the presence in rat colon of atypical fl-adrenoceptors
(non fat, non 12) with lower than conventional affinities for
established non-selective fl-antagonists and specifically activated by the peat.
ri was also competitively antagonized in the rat colon by
 xxxd123xxx  and propranolol but with substantially lower
potency than expected for 062 receptor stimulation. unexpectedly, as we have described elsewhere (manara et al.,
1989a), ri was very poorly susceptible to ici 118,551 in the
same preparation. thus ri too, whose structure resembles
that of the peat, probably inhibits colonic motility by acting
preferentially at atypical rather than at f2-adrenoceptor sites.
unlike peat and ri, iso antagonism by propranolol in the
rat colon cannot be described by a simple linear schild plot
with a slope of unity. this suggests that mechanisms other
than simple competition, such as interaction with more than
one receptor subtype, might be involved in the mediation of
the effects of iso (furchgott, 1972). when a model for two
classes of receptor subtypes was applied, apparent pa2 values
of 8.5 and 6.2 were calculated. thus iso, at low concentrations, interacts with typical (fl, and 62) sites almost exclusively, as also shown by the complete antagonism observed in
the presence of both cgp 20712a and ici 118,551. conversely, at higher concentrations like those used to build up
the schild plot, the contribution of atypical fl-receptors to the
effects of iso becomes predominant. on the other hand
antagonism of iso by  xxxd123xxx , unlike that by propranolol,
apparently disclosed no involvement of f6l- or 92-subsites,
since it turned out to be competitive with a lower pa2 (7.6)
than at conventional,8-adrenoceptors. this apparent inconsistency may depend on the substantially smaller difference in
affinities for typical and atypical sites of  xxxd123xxx  than propranolol (as shown by the pa2 values obtained in the guineapig atrium and trachea and in the rat colon), which probably
makes it difficult to demonstrate multiple colonic iso sites
with  xxxd123xxx .
our results with cgp 20712a, ici 118,551 and propranolol supporting the role of conventional fi-adrenoceptors for iso
inhibition of rat colon motility are consistent with those of ek
et al. (1986ab) in isolated strips from rat ascending colon,
where either 81- or f2-adrenoceptors, presumably located on
neuronal elements of the intramural plexuses and smooth
muscle cells respectively, apparently accounted for the interactions observed with several established specific agonists and
antagonists. as to the cellular location of the putative atypical
site mediating peat inhibition of colonic motility, our experiments showing comparable potencies of sr 5861 1a in the
presence and absence of the neuronal blocker tetrodotoxin
suggest the prevalence of postjunctional non-neuronal structures.
the question of multiple adrenoceptor sites mediating catecholamine inhibition of gut motility and their characterization
has been addressed by several authors (furness & costa,
1974; burnstock & wong, 1981; daniel, 1982; ek, 1985).
attempts to interpret mechanical responses in the gut in terms
of actions at currently recognized adrenoceptor sites have
often been hampered by abnormal conditions, such as the low
potencies of established adrenoceptor antagonists in preventing these effects. thus, relaxant responses to catecholamines

phenylethanolaminotetralines, new fi-agonists

resistant to a- and/or fl-adrenoceptor blockers have been
described in rabbit stomach (bristow et al., 1970) and intestine
(wikberg, 1977), in rat oesophageal smooth muscle (buckner &
cristopherson, 1974), gastric fundus (dettmar et al., 1986) and
proximal colon (croci et al., 1988a), in guinea-pig gastric
fundus (coleman et al., 1987) and ileum (bond et al., 1986), in
dog distal colon (grivegnee et al., 1984) and in human colonic
circular smooth muscle (mclaughlin et al., 1988). such observations in general have prompted their authors to suggest that
there are atypical adrenoceptors in different gut segments,
while others have argued against the creation of further receptor subclasses simply because of observed anomalies (raper,
1987).
the studies by bond & clarke on histamine- or electricallystimulated longitudinal muscle of guinea-pig ileum (bond et
al., 1986; bond & clarke, 1988) are of special interest in this
connection. on account of the rank order of potencies of
adrenoceptor agonists and of their unresponsiveness or variable resistance to several a- and fl-adrenoceptor antagonists in
the above preparations, it was suggested that ileal relaxation
occurred through a putative adrenoceptor with properties distinct from those of conventional a- and fl-subtypes. more
recent work by the same group (blue et al., 1988; 1989) recognized cyanopindolol and  xxxd123xxx  as the antagonists with
the highest affinities for the designated 'fl-like' atypical site,
which was otherwise resistant to propranolol and to the
fl1-selective adrenoceptor blocking agent atenolol. in spite of
some similarities, the putative fl-adrenoceptor atypical site in
the rat colon described in the present study and that described
by blue et al. (1988) are unlikely to be the same, because the
latter had substantially lower affinity for  xxxd123xxx  (pa2 6.5)
and was virtually refractory to propranolol rather than just
sensitive.
,f-adrenoceptors mediating lipolysis, atypical because of
their low sensitivity to specific antagonists, have been found in
rat adipocytes (harms et al., 1977; arch et al., 1984). although
this finding was recently questioned on the basis of the results
of radioligand binding studies (bahouth & malbon, 1988) not
compatible with those of functional studies (zaagsma &
nahorski, 1990), novel lipolytic agonists that potently and
selectively stimulate receptors in adipocytes have been synthesized (arch et al., 1984; wilson et al., 1984). it is worth mentioning that these lipolytic agents also potently relaxed
prostaglandin-contracted guinea-pig stomach fundus
(coleman et al., 1987) and histamine-contracted guinea-pig
ileum (bond & clarke, 1988), apparently by stimulating atypicalb-adrenoceptors. the peat have been preliminary shown
to have considerable in vitro lipolytic action on rat white adipocytes (manara et al., 1989a).
additional tissues with anomalous responses to adrenoceptor agents that have been tentatively ascribed to atypical,
possibly fl, sites include the feline myocardium, where a low
sensitivity component of the concentration-effect curve for the
positive chronotropic action of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  was resistant to
combined blockade of fil- and  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptors (kaumann &

837

lobnig, 1986). even the proposed antinociceptive action of
several fl-adrenoceptor agonists in the mouse abdominal constriction test was attributed to stimulation of atypical freceptors (bentley & starr, 1986).
establishing the exact nature of all these receptors and
whether any of them are identical, irrespective of their different tissue and/or precise cellular locations, obviously calls for
much more work. the unequivocal demonstration of one or
more new preceptor subtypes as separate individual entities,
will depend on the availability of antagonists selective for each
of them. another approach might involve the application of
molecular biology techniques like cloning the putative-coding
dna sequence, which is currently used for studying the heterogeneity of adrenoceptors (frielle et al., 1988; libert et al.,
1989). quite recently a human gene has in fact been isolated
reputedly coding for a 'f3-adrenoceptor' in eukaryotic cells
transfected with it and producing  xxxd1773xxx  upon stimulation with several adrenoceptor agonists, whose relative
potencies resembled the pattern for eliciting functional
responses in preparations currently believed to contain atypicalfl-adrenoceptors (emorine et al., 1989). in the cyclic ampproducing system specific antagonists were tested exclusively
against iso which was inhibited only by cgp 20712a and ici
118,551 in the micromolar range, but not by  xxxd123xxx  or
propranolol. this pharmacological characterization indicates
substantial differences from the site described by us in the rat
colon and does not provide firm evidence that any of the
other previously described atypical fl-adrenoceptor sites is the
same as the receptor expressed by the transfected cells.
further understanding of the mechanism of action of the
peat is certainly pertinent to the above context and merits
special attention for three main reasons: (1) the potency and
specificity of the peat support their use as proposed selective
agonists at the presumed new non l1- non f2-adrenoceptor in
the rat colon; (2) the action of the peat on the colon was
antagonized by established nonselective 8-adrenoceptor
blocking agents at concentrations definitely higher than at
conventional fl-sites, but still low enough to substantiate the
specificity of the finding; (3) whatever the mechanism of the
relative specificity for the gut of the peat in vitro, it is highly
likely to be of functional significance because we have already
observed in animals the in vivo dissociation of their potent
inhibition of intestinal motility from cardiovascular and other
side effects of potential clinical relevance (croci et al., 1988b;
1989; giudice et al., 1989; manara et al., 1989a).
