to investigate the opiate receptors that mediate antinociception, the activity profiles of opioid
analgesic drugs have been determined against different nociceptive stimuli in the mouse and rat.
2 in tests that employ heat as the nociceptive stimulus, p-opiate receptor agonists, such as morphine, pethidine and dextropropoxyphene, had steep and parallel dose-response curves and were
capable of achieving maximum effects. in addition, the antinociceptive potency ratios of these drugs
in heat tests were similar to those for analgesia in man.
3 the k-agonists, such as ethylketazocine, nalorphine, mr2034 and pentazocine, were essentially
inactive against heat nociception except at doses that caused sedation and motor incapacitation.
4 in the writhing and paw pressure tests both j- and a--agonists produced steep and parallel
dose-response curves.
5 it is concluded that both and k-opiate receptors mediate antinociception in animals and that
the interactions of analgesic drugs with these receptors may be classified in terms of their antinociceptive activities against qualitatively different nociceptive stimuli.

introduction

there is considerable evidence that opiate receptors
exist in differing forms. martin, eades, thompson,
huppler & gilbert (1976) and gilbert & martin
(1976) showed that opioid drugs could be classified in
terms of their effects on several parameters in the
chronic spinal dog as being either morphine-like
(j-receptor), nalorphine-like (k-receptor) or
n-allylnormetazocine-like (a-receptor). hutchinson,
kosterlitz, leslie, terenius & waterfield (1975), lord,
waterfield, hughes & kosterlitz (1976) and kosterlitz
& leslie (1978) have identified a further receptor in
the mouse vas deferens for the binding sites of the
naturally occurring opioid peptides. this latter receptor was designated the 6-receptor. the functions of
these different receptors in relation to the many pharmacological actions of opioid drugs remains somewhat obscure.
on measuring the antinociceptive activities of
opioid analgesic drugs in animals it has been
observed that certain drugs that have potent analgesic
activity in man such as nalorphine (lasagna &
beecher, 1954) and pentazocine (archer, albertson,
harris, pierson, bird, keats, telford & papadopoulos, 1962) are essentially inactive in hot plate and
radiant heat tail flick tests in rodents. in contrast, the
antinociceptive activities of these drugs can readily be
detected in writhing tests in the mouse (taber, greenhouse & irwin, 1964) and against tooth pulp stimulation in the dog (skingle & tyers, 1979).

the aim of the present study was to investigate the
differences between antinociceptive tests and to identify the opiate receptors that mediate the antinociceptive actions of opioid analgesic drugs.

methods
the methods used to evaluate antinociceptive activity
were selected to include tests which employed different types of noxious stimuli, i.e., heat, chemical, and
pressure.
tests in mice (male, ahm/i/ici-derived, 18 to 22 g)
and rats (male, ah random bred hooded, 35 to 80 g)
were all carried out under essentially the same experimental conditions. individual tests were carried out
using dose-groups of 6 animals. data for the calculation of ed50 values were accumulated from 2 or 3
individual tests carried out on different days (< 7 days
apart), such that the final dose-groups comprised 12
or 18 animals respectively. to eliminate cage interaction the animals were randomized into different
cages such that each cage contained animals receiving
different treatments. because tests normally lasted for
a full working day this latter procedure also randomized treatments with respect to time of day and thus
eliminated any bias associated with temporal cycles of
pain sensitivity. animals and drug solutions were
colour coded such that the operators were unaware of
the treatments the animals were receiving. in each
test, one or more drugs were compared with mor© macmillan journals ltd 1980

phine and a placebo control in which 0.9% w/v naci
solution (saline) was given in the same dose-volume.
in all tests, drugs were given subcutaneously 30 min
before testing for antinociceptive activity. drugs were
dissolved in saline and injected in a dose volume of
0.2 ml/20 g body wt. the results presented refer to the
free acid/base equivalent.
antinociceptive activities (ed50), 95% confidence
limits, regression slopes, linearity and potency ratios,
where applicable, were calculated by methods of finney (1964).

acetylcholine-induced writhing in the mouse
tests were carried out to determine the inhibitory
effects of the test drugs against writhing induced by
acetylcholine in the mouse. thirty minutes after subcutaneous injection of drug or placebo, mice were
injected with acetylcholine, 3 mg/kg intraperitoneally.
the number of writhes occurring in the first 5 min
thereafter was recorded. a writhe was defined as a
contraction of the abdominal muscles accompanied
by an extension of the hind limbs. the ed50 value
was defined as the dose of test drug capable of reducing by 50% the number of writhes occurring in
placebo-treated mice.

but reacted to the stimulus with strong attempts to
withdraw their paws. either reaction was taken as the
nociceptive response.
for calculation of ed50 values, results relate to the
mean pre-yeast nociceptive responses, called the
'mean 0 h responses', determined for both paws in all
of the rats in the test. for yeast-inflamed paws the
ed50 value was defined as the dose of test drug that
raised the nociceptive threshold to a value half-way
between the mean hyperesthesia determined for the
yeast-inflamed paws of placebo-treated rats and the
'mean 0 h response'. for non-inflamed paws the ed50
was arbitrarily defined as the dose of test drug that
raised the nociceptive threshold by 100 g above the
'mean 0 h response'.

tail immersion tests in the rat
in the tail immersion tests the noxious stimulus was
hot water maintained at either 50 or 55°c. nociceptive reaction times, which were the times taken for the
rats to 'flick' their tails or to withdraw them from the
hot water, were determined. the ed50 value was
arbitrarily defined as the dose of test drug that raised
the reaction time to a value twice that determined for
placebo control animals.

hot plate test in the mouse

drugs

in the hot plate test, reaction times of mice placed on
a copper plate heated to a mean (±range) temperature of 55 + 0.2°c were determined. a 'front paw lick'
was taken as the nociceptive response at which time
the animals were rapidly removed from the hot plate;
60 s was taken as the maximum reaction time. the
ed50 value was arbitrarily defined as the dose of test
drug capable of elevating the reaction time to twice
that determined for placebo-treated animals.

the following drugs were used: morphine hydrochloride, codeine phosphate, pethidine hydrochloride (macfarlan smith); dextropropoxyphene
(dista); ah7921 [3,4-dichloro-n[(l-(dimethylamino)
cyclohexyl)methyl]benzamide hydrochloride] (glaxo
group research ltd.); (±)-ethylketazocine methanesulphonate, (±)-ketazocine methanesulphonate; pentazocine as the free base (sterling-winthrop); buprenorphine hydrochloride (reckitt and colman);
mr2034 as the free base [(-)-a4lr, 5r, 9r)-5,9-dimethyl-2-(l-tetrahydrofurfuryl)-2'-hydroxy-6, 7-benzomorphan], mr 1353 [(± )-ax-5, 9-dimethyl-2-(3-methylfurfuryl}2'-hydroxy-6, 7-benzomorphan methane-sulphonate] (dr h. merz, boehringer-ingelheim); nalorphine hydrobromide (burroughs wellcome); acetylcholine chloride (sigma).

paw pressure test in the rat

the effects of test drugs on nociceptive pressure
thresholds of both yeast-inflamed and non-inflamed
hind paws were determined in rats. initial nociceptive
thresholds were determined for both hind paws in all
of the rats using an 'analgesymeter' (ugo basile,
milan). each rat received an injection of 0.1 ml of
20% w/v suspension of brewer's yeast (cwe ltd.,
cawston, norfolk) given subcutaneously into the subplantar surface of the right hind paw and then
returned to their test cages. test drugs were injected
subcutaneously 3.5 h after the yeast injection. nociceptive thresholds were re-determined 30 min later,
i.e. 4 h after the yeast injections. the nociceptive response was usually a shrill vocalisation which was
clearly distinguishable from that which often occurred
with normal handling. a few animals did not vocalize

results
hot plate and tail immersion tests
the antinociceptive activities (ed50) of the analgesic
drugs tested in the hot plate (55°c) test in the mouse
and tail immersion (50 and 55°c) tests in the rat are
given in table 1. dose-response curves are shown in
figures i to 3. in these tests morphine, codeine,
 xxxd3031xxx , pethidine and ah7921 produced

opiate receptors that mediate antinociception

steep dose-response curves and reached maximum
effects without causing any observable motor incapacitation (figure 1). on lowering the temperature in
the tail immersion test from 55°c to 50°c there was
no significant change in the antinociceptive potency
of these drugs. buprenorphine, 0.5 to 5.0 mg/kg was
effective in the hot plate test but produced a shallower
dose-response curve than morphine and did not reach
maximum effect (figure 2a). higher doses of buprenorphine, 5 to 20 mg/kg, in the hot plate test caused
less effect, producing a bell-shaped dose-response
curve. in the tail immersion (55°c) test (figure 2)
buprenorphine, 0.3 to 3.0 mg/kg, produced rather
variable effects with shallow dose-regression and a
low maximum (figure 2b). in the lower temperature
tail immersion (50°c) test buprenorphine, 0.06 to 0.5
mg/kg, produced a more consistent effect; it was
about 4 times more potent than in the higher temperature test, but the dose-response curve was much
shallower than that for morphine reaching only 40%
of maximum. furthermore, as in the hot plate test,
the highest dose of buprenorphine, 0.5 mg/kg, produced less effect than the next lower dose of 0.25
mg/kg.
the benzomorphans, ethylketazocine and. mrl353,
produced steep dose-response curves in both the hot
plate and tail immersion tests (figure 2 and 3) but in
contrast to the effects of morphine the effective doses
of these drugs also produced marked motor
incapacitation, i.e., the animals were clearly unable to
respond to the nociceptive stimulus. pentazocine
increased hot plate reaction latency and caused seda-

tion in mice but had no effect in the tail immersion
tests in the rat (figure 2).
similarly, ketazocine and mr2034 produced very
shallow dose-response curves in the hot plate test in
the mouse as well as motor incapacitation (figure 3a
and 2a) but were inactive at 80 and 20 mg/kg respectively in both tail immersion tests in the rat. nalorphine, 0.1 to 80 mg/kg was inactive in the hot plate
and tail immersion tests and had no observable effects
on behaviour.

acetylcholine-induced writhing and paw pressure tests
the antinociceptive activities (ed50) of the analgesic
drugs tested in the acetylcholine-induced writhing test
in the mouse and inflamed and non-inflamed paw
pressure tests in the rat are given in table 2. doseresponse curves are shown in figures 4 to 6.
with the exception of ketazocine and nalorphine,
all drugs tested produced parallel dose-response
curves and reached maximum effects.when tested in
the acetylcholine-induced writhing and paw pressure
tests. the responses to ketazocine, 0.1 to- 10 mg/kg, in
the writhing test (figure 6a) were similar to those for
the other drugs but in the paw pressure tests doseresponse curves were shallow and did not reach maximum effect (figure 6b, c). nalorphine, 0.03 to 1.0
mg/kg, in the writhing test achieved only 75% inhibition (figure 5a) and in the yeast inflamed and noninflamed paw pressure tests the dose-response curves
reached a ceiling at 35 and 55% of maximum respectively. higher doses (> 1.0 mg/kg) of nalorphine in the

the potency differences for the actions of drugs in
heat compared with non-heat tests ranged from one

than in the hot plate and tail immersion tests. for the
remaining drugs the potency differences ranged from
10 for mrl353 which produced motor incapacitation
in the mouse and rat at the same doses that prolonged reaction latencies, to greater than 400 (buprenorphine).

statistical analyses

a principal components analysis was carried out on
the antinociceptive data from rodent tests assuming
that the log ed50s were from a multivariant normal
distribution. the aim of this analysis was to find a
small number of linear combinations of the original 6
variables (tests) which could explain the majority of
the total variance. examination of the coefficients of
these principle components revealed that 93% of the
total variance fell within two components. the first
(y1) explains 60% of the variance and is a measure of
the overall antinociceptive activity in all of the tests.
the second component (y2) accounts for 33% of the

opiate receptors that mediate antinociception

1976) is based on the pharmacological profiles of a
of opioid analgesic drugs on several parameters.
of these parameters, two were included to determine
the antinociceptive activities of the drugs. these were
the 'flexor reflex' response to a pressure stimulus and
range

508

m.b. tyers

the 'skin twitch' response latency to a radiant heat
stimulus. drugs classified as p-opiate receptor agonists were about equally effective against both pressure and radiant heat stimuli while drugs that had
high activity on k-opiate receptors were effective
against pressure nociception but less effective or inactive against radiant heat nociception. the benzomorphan skf10047 (n-allynormetazocine), a a-receptor
agonist, was only very weakly active against the flexor
reflex in the dog and was inactive in the
phenylquinone-writhing test in the mouse (pearl &
harris, 1966). it is unlikely therefore, that a-receptors
are involved in antinociception.
the results obtained in the present study show that
the interactions of opioid analgesic drugs with their
receptors may also be defined in terms of their antinociceptive activity profiles against different noxious
stimuli in the conscious mouse and rat. the antinociceptive tests used may be divided into two categories
according to their sensitivities to opioid analgesic
drugs. the hot plate and tail immersion tests, in
which heat is the nociceptive stimulus form one category and writhing and pressure tests form another.
morphine-like compounds, including  xxxd3031xxx , pethidine, codeine and ah7921 are p-opiate
receptor agonists. that is, they strongly and completely suppress the abstinence syndrome in withdrawn morphine-dependent monkeys and/or dogs
(deneau & seevers, 1964; martin et al., 1976). in the
isolated ileum of the guinea-pig and mouse vas
deferens preparations, their potency ratios are the
same as that for morphine (hughes, kosterlitz & les-

lie, 1975). results obtained in the present study show
that the p-opiate receptor agonists are approximately
equipotent in heat and non-heat antinociceptive tests.
in these tests they produced steep dose-response
curves and were able to reach maximum effect. in
addition, the ranked order of potency for these drugs
in all of the animal tests studied is the same as the
order of potency for their analgesic potencies in man.
this indicates that for p-agonists, antinociceptive activities in both heat and non-heat tests are predictive
of analgesic potencies in man.
the remaining drugs in this study are predominantly agonists on the k-receptor. that is, they do not
substitute for morphine in the dependent monkey
(villarreal & seevers, 1972; swain & seevers 1974;
1976); in the chronic spinal dog they have a profile of
action that differs from that of the p-agonists (martin
et al., 1976) and in the mouse isolated vas deferens
they are more potent than in the guinea-pig ileum
relative to morphine; in both preparations more
naloxone is required to antagonize their effects than
those of the p-agonists (hutchinson et al., 1975).
results obtained in the present study indicate that in
antinociceptive tests the k-agonists are significantly
more effective against writhing and pressure noxia
than against heat-induced nociception. these drugs
are also very potent against tooth pulp stimulation in
the dog (skingle & tyers, 1979; 1980). of the drugs
tested, the most selective agonist on k-receptors was
the benzomorphan, mr2034. ethylketazocine, pentazocine and mrl353 were also more potent against
responses to non-heat stimuli than against heat-

tail immersion tests also caused marked sedation,
ataxia and, at the higher doses, loss of righting reflex.
these animals were unable to respond to the heat
stimulus and therefore the activities of these drugs in
heat tests were most probably an indication of their

effects on motor coordination rather than on nociception. therefore, for these drugs, particularly ethylketazocine, any actions on .-receptors in heat tests would
be masked by their depressant properties. similar
observations were reported by harris & rosenberg
(1967) who showed that the activities of pentazocine
and cyclazocine in the hot plate test were due to sedation or motor in-coordination as measured using an
inclined screen.
nalorphine could also be classified as a k-agonist
but compared with mr2034 the dose-response curves
were shallow and lower maximum effects were
obtained. martin et al. (1976) obtained a similar result
for nalorphine in the chronic spinal dog on the flexor
reflex response. thus, results obtained in the present
study support the concept that nalorphine is a partial
agonist on k-receptors. one finding that is difficult to
explain is that higher doses of nalorphine in the paw
pressure test consistently produced lesser effects than
lower doses. this bell-shaped dose-response curve is
similar to that found for buprenorphine in heat tests
and for inhibition of gut propulsion (cowan, lewis &
macfarlane, 1977).
ketazocine was only weakly active against heatinduced nociception at doses that also caused sedation. in the paw pressure test ketazocine was more
potent than against heat nociception but produced a
shallow dose-response curve with low maximum
effect. however, in the acetylcholine-writhing test in
the mouse the dose-response curve was parallel to
that of mr2034 and reached maximum effect. it may
be that ketazocine is also a partial agonist on k-recep-

tors but has a higher intrinsic activity than nalorphine.
buprenorphine, at doses devoid of sedative activity,
produced a shallow dose-response curve with low
maximum effect in the hot plate and tail immersion
tests. this finding is consistent with the classification
of buprenorphine as a partial agonist on j-receptors
(martin et al., 1976). however, buprenorphine was
much more potent (50 to 400 times) against non-heat
than against heat noxia suggesting that this drug is
predominantly an agonist on k-receptors. further evidence that the predominant antinociceptive actions of
morphine and buprenorphine are mediated via different opiate receptors is shown when these drugs are
injected into the spinal subarachnoid space in rats
(byrant & tyers, 1979). by this route, low doses of
morphine are antinociceptive in hot plate and paw
pressure tests but buprenorphine is inactive until the
intrathecal dose exceeds that which is active by the
subcutaneous route.
the results obtained show that heat and non-heat
antinociceptive tests in rodents distinguish between pand k-opiate receptors. nalorphine, buprenorphine
and the benzomorphans tested appear to have antinociceptive actions that are mediated predominantly
through interactions with k-opiate receptors. the
ranked order of potency for these drugs is the same in
each of the non-heat tests and for their analgesic
potencies, where known, in man. there is no correlation between the antinociceptive potency ratios in
heat and non-heat tests.
the extent of interaction, if any, of the 1t-agonists
with k-receptors cannot be determined from these
data. in terms of antinociception-it may be that the
agonist actions on pi- and k-receptors selectively inhibit responses to heat and non-heat noxia respectively. if this were so, then because the ranked order of
potency is the same in each of the tests for the p-agonists, they would be expected to be equally efficacious
on both 1t- and k-receptors. this seems unlikely in
view of the widely differing chemical structures of the

t-agonists.
it is more likely that interaction with either receptor can inhibit nociception arising from the non-heat
stimuli employed here while interaction with 1s-receptors is necessary for inhibition of nociception arising
from heat stimuli. this postulate would also imply
that there are at least two neural pathways which
either inhibit or convey nociception arising from heat
and non-heat stimuli. experiments with opiate receptor antagonists and receptor binding studies are
needed to confirm these concepts.
in contrast to some of the results presented here,
several investigators have shown that the antinociceptive actions of analgesic drugs with dual agonist and
antagonist actions may be evaluated in hot plate
(o'callaghan & holtzman, 1975) tail flick (gray,

opiate receptors that mediate antinociception

osterberg & scuto, 1970) and tail immersion (sewell
& spencer, 1976) tests providing that the temperature
is lowered to give a less intense nociceptive stimulus.
however, even in these tests, the antinociceptive
potencies reported for these drugs were still considerably lower than their analgesic potencies in man or
indeed in other non-heat antinociceptive tests. in the
present study, of all the drugs tested, only buprenorphine was slightly more potent in the lower than in
the higher temperature tail immersion test.
in conclusion, evidence has been presented to show
that at least two opiate receptors mediate antinociception in animal tests. in addition, it has been shown
that opioid analgesic drugs may be classified in terms
of their profiles of antinociceptive actions against dif-

511

ferent noxia. tests that employ heat as the nociceptive
stimulus, such as the hot plate and tail immersion
tests, are selective for ji-agonists and are insensitive to
the antinociceptive actions of k-agonists. tests that
employ pressure, chemical writhing or tooth pulp
stimulation (skingle & tyers, 1979) are sensitive to
both p- and k-agonists.
