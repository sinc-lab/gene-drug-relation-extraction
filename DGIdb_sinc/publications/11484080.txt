abstract
aims/hypothesis. sulphonylureas stimulate insulin secretion by closing atp-sensitive potassium (katp)
channels in the pancreatic beta-cell membrane. katp
channels are also found in other tissues, including heart
and smooth muscle, where they link cellular metabolism to electrical activity. the sulphonylurea  xxxd2202xxx 
blocks recombinant beta-cell katp channels ( xxxg1250xxx /
 xxxg19xxx ) but not heart ( xxxg1250xxx /sur2a) or smooth muscle ( xxxg1250xxx /sur2b) katp channels with high potency.
in this study, we examined the specificity of  xxxd2202xxx 
for the native (as opposed to recombinant) katp channels in beta cells, heart and smooth muscle.

the sulphonylurea  xxxd2202xxx  is widely used in the
treatment of type ii (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus because of its ability to stimulate insulin
secretion from pancreatic beta-cells. like other sulphonylureas, its principal target is the atp-sensitive
potassium (katp ) channel. this channel plays a major role in controlling the beta-cell membrane potenreceived: 21 march 2001 and in revised form: 30 april 2001

but was much less effective in cardiac and smooth
muscle (ic50s of 19.5  5.4 mmol/l (n = 6±12) and
37.9  1.0 mmol/l (n = 5±10), respectively). in all three
tissues, the action of the drug on whole-cell katp currents was rapidly reversible. in inside-out patches on
beta-cells,  xxxd2202xxx  (1 mmol/l) produced a maximum
of 66  13 % inhibition (n = 5), compared with more
than 98 % block in the whole-cell configuration.
conclusion/interpretation.  xxxd2202xxx  is a high-potency sulphonylurea which shows specificity for the pancreatic beta-cell  xxxg1253xxx  over heart and smooth
muscle. in this respect, it differs from  xxxd2215xxx .
the difference in the maximal block observed in the
excised patch and whole-cell recordings from betacells, may be due to the absence of intracellular mgnucleotides in the excised patch experiments. [diabetologia (2001) 44: 1019±1025]

tial and thereby insulin release. at low plasma glucose concentrations, katp channels are open and the
resulting k+ efflux holds the beta-cell membrane at a
hyperpolarized potential. closure of katp channels
by glucose or sulphonylureas causes depolarization
of the beta-cell membrane, leading to opening of
voltage-gated ca2+ channels, ca2+ influx and a rise in
intracellular ca2+ which stimulates the exocytosis of
insulin-containing secretory granules [1].
katp channels are also found in a variety of other
cell types including cardiac, smooth and skeletal muscle, and some brain neurones [2]. although their
roles in extrapancreatic tissues are less well characterised, it is likely that they open in response to metabolic stress, such as during cardiac and cerebral is-

chaemia [3]. in the heart, it is believed that they play
a key role in the intrinsic mechanisms that protect
cardiac muscle during ischaemia [4]. in arterial
smooth muscle, katp channels are important in the
control of contractile tone and therefore of blood
pressure and blood flow [5]. cardiovascular disease
is a major cause of death in patients with diabetes
and it has been argued that this could, at least in
part, be related to the effects of sulphonylureas on
katp channels in cardiac and vascular smooth muscles [6±8]. in view of the clinical use of  xxxd2202xxx  in
type ii diabetes, it is important to know to what extent the different types of  xxxg1253xxx  are blocked
by this sulphonylurea.
the  xxxg1253xxx  is an octameric complex of two
different protein subunits: an inwardly rectifying  xxxg1232xxx ,  xxxg1250xxx  or kir6.1, and a sulphonylurea receptor, sur [9±15]. the former acts as an
 xxxg1253xxx  pore while sur is a channel regulator that endows  xxxg1250xxx  with sensitivity to
drugs such as the inhibitory sulphonylureas and to
k+-channel openers like  xxxd1868xxx  [16]. katp channels in different tissues are composed of different
kir and sur subunits. based on northern blotting,
in situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry and functional studies of cloned katp channels expressed in
several expression systems, it seems that  xxxg1250xxx  is
used as the pore-forming subunit in most tissues, except for various vascular smooth muscles where
kir6.1 serves the same function [10±12]. the type of
sur is far more variable between tissues. the betacell  xxxg1253xxx  is composed of  xxxg19xxx , cardiac and
skeletal muscle katp channels of sur2a and smooth
muscle katp channels of sur2b [9,13±15].
the different types of sur subunit endow katp
channels with different sensitivities to various drugs
[17]. in particular,  xxxd2202xxx  and  xxxd3394xxx  produce high-affinity inhibition of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  (betacell type) channels but not  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a (cardiac)
or  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b (smooth muscle) types of katp
channels, when expressed in xenopus oocytes
[18,19].  xxxd2203xxx ,  xxxd2215xxx  and meglitinide,
in contrast, inhibit both  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg1250xxx /
sur2a channels with high potency [19]. it has therefore been proposed that  xxxg19xxx  possesses high-affinity
binding sites for both  xxxd2202xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx 
while sur2a has only a single high-affinity binding
site for  xxxd2215xxx  [18±19].
we have investigated whether  xxxd2202xxx  interacts
with different types of native katp channels with a
similar potency and specificity to that found for their
cloned counterparts by studying the effect of the
drug on the native channels of pancreatic beta-cells,
cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle. our results indicate that, unlike  xxxd2215xxx ,  xxxd2202xxx 
produces high-affinity inhibition of the pancreatic
beta-cell  xxxg1253xxx  but is much less effective on
katp channels of cardiac and arterial smooth muscle.

materials and methods
cell isolation: mouse pancreatic islets and b-cells. mice were
killed by cervical dislocation. the pancreas was removed, cut
into pieces and placed in hank's solution containing collagenase (in mmol/l): 137 nacl, 1.2 nahpo4, 5.6 kcl, 1.2 cacl2,
10 hepes (ph 7.4 with naoh), 4.2 nahco3, 2.8 glucose
plus 5 mg/ml bovine  xxxg124xxx  and 2.5 mg/ml collagenase. the pancreas was digested by hand shaking in this solution
for 8 min and islets were then removed by hand. isolated islets
were dispersed into single cells by trituration at 37 c in a solution containing (mmol/l): 137 nacl, 1.2 nahpo4, 5.6 kcl,
1 egta, 10 hepes (ph 7.4 with naoh), 4.2 nahco3, and
2.8 glucose. beta cells were maintained in rpmi tissue culture medium containing 11 mmol/l glucose supplemented
with 10 % fetal calf serum at 37 c in a humidified atmosphere
of 5 % co2 in air. cells were used 1 to 4 days after the isolation.
cell isolation: rat cardiac ventricular and mesenteric arterial
myocytes. male adult wistar rats were killed by cervical dislocation, and ventricular myocytes isolated from adult rat hearts
by enzymatic dissociation with collagenase and protease in a
langendorff apparatus [20]. cells were stored in plastic petri
dishes  xxxd1891xxx  to 12 c and used within 2 days. mesenteric arteries were removed and cleaned of connective tissue. second
and third order branches of the arteries were dissected and
treated with papain, collagenase and hyaluronidase [21]. single
smooth muscle cells were obtained by trituration with a widebore pipette. cells were stored at 4 to 6 c and used on the
day of preparation.
electrophysiology: beta-cells. whole-cell katp currents were
recorded using the conventional whole-cell configuration of
the patch-clamp technique and single-channel currents were
recorded from inside-out membrane patches. patch pipettes
were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries coated with sylgard close to their tips and fire-polished immediately before
use. they had resistances of 2 to 5 mw when filled with pipette
solution. membrane potentials and whole-cell currents were
recorded using an axopatch 200b patch-clamp amplifier
(axon instruments, union city, calif., usa) and stored on
digital audio tape for later analysis. the zero current potential
of the pipette was adjusted with the pipette in the bath before
the seal was established and no corrections have been made
for liquid junction potentials. whole-cell currents flowing
through katp channels were monitored using alternate
 20 mv pulses of 200 ms duration which were applied at a frequency of 0.5 hz from a holding potential of ±70 mv. singlechannel currents were recorded at ±60 mv. currents were filtered at 2 khz, digitized at 5 khz using a digidata 1200 interface and subsequently analysed using pclamp 7 (axon instruments) and in-house software.
after formation of the whole-cell configuration, whole-cell
katp currents gradually increase in size, as atp dialyses out
of the cell into the pipette solution [22]. drugs were therefore
applied only once the whole-cell katp current had reached a
steady state amplitude. the standard extracellular (bath) solution contained (mmol/l): 137 nacl, 5.6 kcl, 1.2 mgcl2, 2.6
cacl2, 10 hepes (ph 7.4 with naoh). the intracellular (pipette) solution contained (mmol/l): 107 kcl, 1 mgcl2, 1
cacl2, 10 egta, 10 hepes (ph 7.15 with koh). atp
(0.3 mmol/l) was added to the pipette to prevent rundown of
 xxxg1253xxx  activity. for inside-out patch recordings, the extracellular (pipette) solution contained (mmol/l); 140 kcl, 2.6
cacl2, 1.2 mgcl2, 10 k-hepes (ph 7.4). the bath (intracellular) solution contained (mmol/l): 107 kcl, 1 mgcl2, 1

electrophysiology: mesenteric arterial myocytes.  xxxd2215xxx -sensitive katp currents were recorded at ±60 mv using
the conventional whole-cell patch-clamp and an axopatch
200b patch-clamp amplifier. the extracellular solution contained (mmol/l): 140 kcl, 1 mgcl2, 0.1 cacl2, 10 hepes (ph

1 mgcl2, 1 cacl2, 0.1 na2atp, 0.1 adp, 0.5 gtp. sulphonylureas were added to the extracellular solution and concentration-response curves constructed as described below.
the perfusion system allowed the bath to be exchanged within
2 min. experiments were done at room temperature
(20±24 c).
electrophysiology: data analysis. for beta-cell experiments,
concentration-response relations for  xxxd2202xxx  inhibition of
katp currents were obtained by alternating test solutions with
control ( xxxd2202xxx -free) solution. the control conductance
was taken as the mean of that obtained in control solution before and after application of the test  xxxd2202xxx  concentration.
in the case of cardiac and smooth muscle experiments, the control current amplitude was measured as described in the results.
the katp current in  xxxd2202xxx  (i) is plotted as a fraction of
that obtained in the control solution (ic). data were fit with

results
katp channels in pancreatic beta-cells. katp currents
recorded from a single beta-cell using the standard
whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique are shown in figure 1 a. in this configuration,
the cell cytoplasm is dialysed with the pipette solution. consequently, at low atp concentrations, the
katp currents increase with time after the whole-cell
mode is established, as cytosolic atp washes out of
the cell [22]. in general, the maximum washout current is observed with a pipette concentration of
0.3 mmol/l atp, as at lower atp concentrations the
currents `rundown' rapidly with time [22]. we therefore used an intracellular concentration of 0.3 mmol/l
atp in all whole-cell recordings and we only tested
the effect of  xxxd2202xxx  after the current had reached
a steady-state. this was normally achieved about
3 min after the whole-cell configuration was established.

fig. 2. effect of  xxxd2202xxx  on single  xxxg1253xxx  currents in
beta-cells. single-channel currents recorded from an insideout patch at ±60 mv in the presence and absence of 10 mmol/l
 xxxd2202xxx , as indicated

at a concentration of 1 mmol/l,  xxxd2202xxx  blocked
the beta-cell katp current almost completely
(fig. 1a). the onset of block was fast and inhibition
was largely reversible on removal of the drug. however, at the highest drug concentrations tested
(10 mmol/l, a suprapharmacological concentration),
the current did not always fully reverse once the
drug was removed.
the relation between  xxxd2202xxx  concentration and
the inhibition of the katp current is given in figure
1b. the data are consistent with the idea that  xxxd2202xxx  blocks native katp currents by interaction with a
single site and the concentration-inhibition curve is
well fit by the hill equation (1). half-maximal inhibition (ic50) was observed at 184  30 nmol/l  xxxd2202xxx 
(n = 6±10) and the current was almost completely
blocked by 10 mmol/l  xxxd2202xxx . the hill coefficient
(slope factor) for  xxxd2202xxx  block was close to unity
(0.93  0.12; n = 6±10). this result suggests that the
binding of a single molecule of  xxxd2202xxx  is sufficient
to block the  xxxg1253xxx .
in previous studies of  xxxd2202xxx  inhibition of the
cloned beta-cell  xxxg1253xxx ,  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx , heterologously expressed in xenopus oocytes, we observed that high-affinity  xxxd2202xxx  block was not
complete when the drug was applied to the intracellular surface of an excised patch [18]. to determine
if this is also the case for the native channel, we examined the inhibitory effect of 10 mmol/l  xxxd2202xxx 
in inside-out patches excised from isolated betacells.  xxxd2202xxx  was also effective when applied to
the intracellular membrane surface (fig. 2). at a
concentration of 10 mmol/l,  xxxd2202xxx  blocked the
beta-cell  xxxg1253xxx  by 66  3 % (n = 5). this is
much less than in the intact cell ( ~ 95 %, fig. 1),
but is similar to the extent of the block observed under the same conditions for  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  channels expressed in xenopus oocytes (61  4 %, n = 8;
[18]).

ing 6 mmol/l k+. cells were initially voltage clamped
at ±70 mv and were then depolarised to 0 mv for
the duration of the experiment. unlike beta-cell
katp currents, those of cardiac myocytes are largely
blocked, even when the cell is dialysed with intracellular solutions containing low atp [3]. katp currents of ventricular myocytes were therefore activated by applying the  xxxg1253xxx  opener pinacidil
(200 mmol/l) to the extracellular solution (fig. 3) and
concentration-inhibition curves for  xxxd2202xxx  were
measured in the presence of pinacidil. because pinacidil activation was followed by a slow decline in the
current amplitude (fig. 3),  xxxd2202xxx  was applied after the katp current had reached a steady state. a
maximum of three concentrations were applied to
any one cell, in increasing concentrations.  xxxd2215xxx  (10 mmol/l) was added at the end of the experiment, and the control katp current was taken as the
difference between the steady-state current after the
addition of pinacidil and that in the additional presence of  xxxd2215xxx . we show the mean concentration-response curve for  xxxd2202xxx  inhibition (fig. 3b).

was measured as the difference between the current
in the presence of pinacidil and that in the presence
of pinacidil plus  xxxd2215xxx . the concentrationresponse curve is shown in figure 4 and fitting of
equation (1) gave an ic50 of 37.9  1.0 mmol/l
(n = 5±10) and a hill coefficient of 0.98  0.02. thus
 xxxd2202xxx  seems slightly less potent at blocking katp
channels of arterial smooth muscle than those of cardiac muscle.

for comparison, we also measured the concentration-response curve for the inhibition of the cardiac

100 mmol/l  xxxd2215xxx  was added at the end of
each experiment, and the control katp current was
taken as the difference between the steady-state current in pinacidil and that in 100 mmol/l  xxxd2215xxx 
plus pinacidil. the concentration-inhibition curve
for  xxxd2215xxx  (fig. 3c) is well fit by the hill equation with an ic50 of 7.9  1.1 nmol/l and a hill coefficient of 0.59  0.05 (n = 9±18), consistent with  xxxd2215xxx  being over 2500 times more potent than
 xxxd2202xxx  at blocking cardiac katp channels.
katp channels of arterial smooth muscle. to record
katp currents from smooth muscle cells isolated
from mesenteric arteries, cells were held at ±60 mv
in 140 mmol/l extracellular [k+]. these experimental
conditions minimise activation of other k+ channels
[21, 23]. katp currents were activated by applying
10 mmol/l pinacidil to the extracellular solution, and
under these conditions the pinacidil-activated current
was blocked completely by 10 mmol/l  xxxd2215xxx .
we measured the reduction in the pinacidil-activated
current produced by subsequent application of  xxxd2202xxx , a maximum of three concentrations being applied to any one cell.  xxxd2215xxx  (10 mmol/l) was
applied at the end of each experiment to completely

extent of block. our results show that  xxxd2202xxx 
blocks katp channels in pancreatic beta-cells by interaction with a single high-affinity site. half-maximal inhibition (ic50) was produced by 184 nmol/l  xxxd2202xxx . this is only slightly less potent than the ic50
measured for the high-affinity site of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx 
channels expressed in xenopus oocytes (50  7
nmol/l; n = 8 [18]) and is consistent with the view
that the beta-cell  xxxg1253xxx  is composed of
 xxxg1250xxx  and  xxxg19xxx  subunits.
 xxxd2202xxx  was much less effective at blocking
katp currents in cardiac myocytes and arterial
smooth muscle, the ic50s being 19.5  5.4 mmol/l
(n = 6±12) and 37.9  1.0 mmol/l (n = 5±10), respectively. these values are more than 100-fold and
more than 200-fold, respectively, higher than that observed for the pancreatic beta-cell  xxxg1253xxx  under similar conditions. thus,  xxxd2202xxx  is a high-affinity sulphonylurea that has specificity for the pancreatic beta-cell  xxxg1253xxx .
in contrast, the sulphonylurea  xxxd2215xxx 
seems to show much less tissue selectivity, as it
blocks katp channels in beta-cells and cardiac muscle with ic50 s in the low nanomolar range. the ic50
of 7.9 nmol/l we obtained for inhibition of cardiac
katp channels by  xxxd2215xxx  is consistent with
previous measurements [24, 25] and suggests that
 xxxd2215xxx  is more than 2500-fold more potent in
inhibiting cardiac katp channels than  xxxd2202xxx . the
potency of  xxxd2215xxx  in blocking beta-cell katp
channels (ic50 ~ 4 nmol/l [26]) is greater than that
found for  xxxd2202xxx  (50 nmol/l), and similar to  xxxd2215xxx  block of cardiac katp channels (8 nmol/l).
cardiac katp channels are thought to be composed of  xxxg1250xxx  and sur2a subunits [13]. consistent
with this idea,  xxxd2215xxx  inhibited kir6.2sur2a expressed in xenopus oocytes with an ic50
similar (27 nmol/l [19]) to our present results on the
native channel. the ic50 of 800 mmol/l for  xxxd2202xxx 
inhibition of  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a in xenopus oocytes [18]
was higher than that measured in native cardiac myocytes. there are several possible reasons for this difference. firstly, it might relate to the different cell
types (oocyte vs cardiac myocyte). secondly, in the
xenopus experiments,  xxxd2202xxx  was added to the in-

tracellular face of excised macropatches, while it was
applied in the extracellular solution bathing intact
cardiac myocytes. thirdly, katp currents in cardiac
muscle were activated by the  xxxg1253xxx  opener pinacidil, whereas the drug was not present in the oocyte experiments. finally, intracellular nucleotides
were not present in the xenopus inside-out patch experiments but might be expected to be present in the
whole-cell recordings from cardiac myocytes.
time course of block.  xxxd2202xxx  blocked beta-cell
katp currents rapidly when applied to the intracellular surface of the excised patch and when applied to
the outside of the cell. the slight difference in time
course that we observe may reflect differences in the
rate of drug application rather than in the rate of
binding. however, the washout of the drug was distinctly slower in the whole-cell configuration. this is
in accordance with the idea that the drug binding
site may lie on the intracellular side of the membrane;
in this case, the slower time course of unblock observed in intact cells would reflect the rate at which
the drug can be lost from the beta-cell. there is accumulating evidence that the site at which  xxxd3394xxx 
binds is located on the intracellular side of the membrane [27±29].
comparison of whole-cell and inside-out patch recordings. there is an interesting discrepancy between
the results of our experiments on beta-cells obtained
using whole-cell recordings and those in excised patches. thus in whole-cell recordings, 10 mmol/l  xxxd2202xxx  causes almost complete block of the katp currents, whereas inhibition only amounts to 66 % in excised patches. it is of interest that the maximal extent
of high-affinity block of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  currents measured in excised patches was also 60 %. our results
show that this difference is the result of the patch configuration rather than any difference between the
cloned channel and its native counterpart.
a similar anomaly is found for  xxxd3394xxx  inhibition of beta-cell katp channels, where it has been
shown to result from modulation by mgadp
[30±31]. it is well established that the inhibitory effects of  xxxd3394xxx  on native beta-cell katp channels and on  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  channels are enhanced in
the presence of intracellular mgadp [30±32]. the
enhanced block does not reflect an increased binding
affinity for sulphonylureas when mgadp is present.
instead, it results because sulphonylureas abolish the
stimulatory action of mgadp mediated via  xxxg19xxx ,
whilst leaving the inhibitory effect of the nucleotide
on  xxxg1250xxx  intact [32]. inhibition is thus caused by the
combined actions of mgadp and  xxxd3394xxx . because mgadp is always present in the intact cell but
not (unless deliberately added) in excised patches,
this effect can account for the increased block observed in intact cells. our results suggest that a simi-

lar effect may operate for  xxxd2202xxx . indeed, we
have observed that this is the case for  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx 
channels (data not shown).
possible therapeutic relevance. the extent to which
sulphonylurea therapy contributes to the increased
risk from cardiovascular disease in diabetes has been
debated for several years [6±8]. furthermore, blockade of vascular katp channels can affect blood flow
in coronary and other circulations [5]. thus, it seems
likely that high selectivity for pancreatic beta-cell
katp channels over those of cardiovascular tissues is
a desirable property for sulphonylureas to be used
therapeutically in type ii diabetes.
like  xxxd3394xxx , but in contrast to  xxxd2215xxx 
and  xxxd2203xxx ,  xxxd2202xxx  is able to produce a selective block of katp channels in beta cells. at a concentration of 1 mmol/l, the block is 83 %, 12 % and 3 %
for beta-cell, cardiac and smooth muscle katp channels, respectively. the total concentration of  xxxd2202xxx  (free plus bound) in the plasma of patients treated
with the drug is between 1 and 25 mmol. because of
drug binding to plasma proteins, however, only about
5 % of the drug is free giving an active concentration
of less than 1 mmol/l. this suggests that cross-reactivity of  xxxd2202xxx  with katp channels in the surface
membranes of heart and vascular smooth muscle is
likely to be very small throughout the therapeutic
range. recent experiments suggest that katp channels in the inner mitochondrial membrane are involved in cardiac ischemic preconditioning [4] and
further studies are needed to determine the specificity of different sulphonylureas with regard to these
channels.
