differential effects of n-3 and n-6  xxxd2154xxx  on prostaglandin f2alpha production by bovine endometrial cells.  recent studies have implicated n-3 polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  in the reduction of eicosanoid production in the bovine uterus. the objective of this study was to determine whether the effect of  xxxd2318xxx  (epa; c(20:5), n-3) on pgf2alpha production by bovine endometrial (bend) cells is influenced by the quantity of linoleic acid (c(18:2), n-6) in the incubation medium. confluent bend cells were incubated in the absence (control) or presence of 100 microm of epa for 24 h. after incubation, cells were rinsed and then stimulated with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (pdbu; 100 ng/ml) for 6 h. additional sets of culture dishes were treated with a combination of epa and increasing n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratios for 24 h and then challenged with pdbu for 6 h. the pdbu stimulated pgf2alpha secretion and upregulated steady-state concentrations of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-2 and  xxxg1806xxx  mrna within 6 h. preincubation of bend cells with epa for 24 h decreased pgf2alpha response to  xxxd2925xxx , but had no detectable effects on prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-2 or  xxxg1806xxx  mrna abundance in pdbu-stimulated bend cells. the inhibitory effect of epa on pgf2alpha production was reverted in bend cells treated with an increasing n-6-to-n-3 fatty acid ratio. findings indicate that the net inhibition of endometrial pgf2alpha bioynthesis by n-3  xxxd2154xxx  may vary depending on the ratio of n-6 to n-3  xxxd2154xxx  in the uterus.
