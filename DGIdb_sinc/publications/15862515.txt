abstract
excessive activation of non-nmda receptors, ampa and kainate, contributes to neuronal degeneration in acute and progressive
pathologies, possibly including schizophrenia. because  xxxg1108xxx  agonists have neuroprotective properties (e.g., against nmdainduced neurotoxicity), we compared the effects of the antipsychotics, clozapine, ziprasidone and aripiprazole, that are partial agonists at  xxxg1108xxx  receptor, with those of haloperidol, which is devoid of 5-ht1a agonist properties, on kainic acid (ka)-induced striatal lesion volumes,
in c57bl/6n mice. the involvement of 5-ht1a receptors was determined by antagonist studies with way100635, and data were compared
with those obtained using the potent and high efficacy  xxxg1108xxx  agonist, f13714. intra-striatal ka lesioning and measurement of
lesion volumes using cresyl violet staining were carried out at 48 h after surgery. f13714, antipsychotics or vehicle were administered ip
twice, 30 min before and 3 1/2 h after ka injection. way100635 (0.63 mg/kg) or vehicle were given sc 30 min before each drug injection.
clozapine (2  10 mg/kg), ziprasidone (2  20 mg/kg) and aripiprazole (2  10 mg/kg) decreased lesion volume by 61%, 59% and 73%,
respectively. way100635 antagonized the effect of ziprasidone and of aripiprazole but only slightly attenuated that of clozapine. in contrast,
haloperidol (2  0.16 mg/kg) did not affect ka-induced lesion volume. f13714 dose-dependently decreased lesion volume. the 61%
decrease of lesion volume obtained with f13714 (2  0.63 mg/kg) was antagonized by way100635. way100635 alone did not affect lesion
volume. these results show that  xxxg1108xxx  activation protects against ka-induced striatal lesions and indicate that some atypical
antipsychotic agents with 5-ht1a agonist properties may protect against excitotoxic injury, in vivo.

1. introduction
a variety of studies have reported brain region specific
changes in a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-4propionic acid (ampa)/kainic acid (ka) binding sites in
postmortem schizophrenic brains. for example ampa/ka
binding sites have been reported to decrease in the
hippocampus [28,38,40,66] and either no change [37,45]

or an increase were reported in the cortical regions and
caudate nucleus [58,59,75]. although it is not known if
these changes are primary or compensatory (e.g., induced
by the drug treatments) they suggest the existence of a
dysfunction of the major glutamatergic neurotransmission
systems in schizophrenia [33].
the ability of pcp, a non-competitive nmda receptor
antagonist, to induce some of the symptoms of schizophrenia such as hallucinations, social withdrawal and cognitive deficits has led to the proposal of an bn-methyl-daspartate (nmda) receptor hypofunctionq. since inhibitory

c. cosi et al. / brain research 1043 (2005) 32–41

gabaergic interneurons are activated by stimulation of
nmda receptors located on their surface, nmda receptor
hypofunction would result in a disinhibition of the glutamatergic neurotransmission and excessive continuous
stimulation of non-nmda receptors, ampa and kainite,
and consequent neurodegeneration (for a review, see [24]).
this hypothesis finds its support in the progressive
psychosocial and cognitive deterioration observed in
certain schizophrenic patients and in the progressive neuropathology detected by structural neuroimaging studies
[51,74]. more direct evidence of the possible existence of
neurodegenerative processes in the disease are the
presence in postmortem schizophrenic brains of gross
anatomical signs of neurodegeneration, such as ventricular
enlargement and widened sulci, in the absence of glial
proliferation [29,40,54] and the increase of lipid peroxides in the csf and plasma of schizophrenic patients
[47,63,65].
several atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine and
ziprasidone, can ameliorate cognitive deficit [8,35] and some
of them have been shown to be neuroprotective in different
models of neurotoxicity, in vitro. it has been shown that,
although in certain studies high concentrations of clozapine
lowered pc12 cells survival [27], the antipsychotics,
clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone, protect
pc12 cells either from serum deprivation or mpp+-induced
cell death [5,68]. on the other hand, haloperidol has been
reported either not to protect, at micromolar concentrations,
against mpp+-induced apoptosis in pc12 cells [68] or to
induce toxicity in pc12 cells at millimolar concentrations
[32]. moreover, clozapine and zotepine but not haloperidol
have been reported to be able to prevent vacuolarization
induced by nmda antagonist, included dizocilpine, in the
rat cortex, in vivo [62]. among these agents, clozapine and
quetiapine have 5-hydroxytryptamine1a (5-ht1a) receptor
agonist activity [15,56]. stimulation of 5-ht1a receptors
together with  xxxg656xxx  antagonism or partial
agonism appears to be an important feature of a new class of
improved antipsychotic drugs such as aripiprazole [6,53,72].
stimulation of 5-ht1a receptors is known to produce
neuroprotection in vivo against ischemia and traumatic brain
injury [41,67] and can improve cognitive deficits after
traumatic brain injury [41]. 5-ht1a agonists also protect
against nmda-induced brain lesions. for example, the
prototypical 5-ht1a agonist (f)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propyllamino)tetralin (8-oh-dpat) prevents nmda-induced
lesion of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis and preserves
the cortical cholinergic innervation in the rat [61]. the
mechanism underlying 5-ht1a agonist-induced neuroprotection is still not fully understood but might involve
inhibition of glutamate release [52]. although evidence is
available on the effects of 5-ht1a agonist on nmdainduced toxicity, the effects of 5-ht1a agonist on kainic
acid-induced striatal lesion have not been investigated and
no studies are available concerning the effects of antipsychotics on excitotoxicity in vivo.

kainate has long been known as a powerful axonsparing neurotoxin. kainate injections into rat or mouse
striatum cause degeneration of neuronal perikarya and
dendrites of striatal projection neurons without affecting
fibers of passage and axon terminals from extrinsic sources
[10,18,19,49,50]. decortication, which ablates the corticostriatal glutamatergic pathway, abolishes the neurotoxic
action of kainate in the rat striatum, suggesting that kainate
neurotoxicity relies upon cooperative interactions with
synaptically released glutamate from cortical terminals
[9,50]. although the existence of kainate receptors on
glutamatergic terminals in the rat striatum is controversial,
presynaptic kainate receptors have been located on
glutamatergic afferents in the monkey striatum [14]. these
evidences strongly suggest that activation of these receptors might facilitate the release of glutamate from cortical
terminals. kainic acid striatal toxicity is also correlated
with massive free radicals production via membrane lipids
peroxidation and activation of the  xxxd208xxx 
cascade, activation of energy depleting enzymes, e.g., poly
(adp-ribose) polymerase, and depletion of atp and
nad+ [16,17,30].
in the present study, we investigated the effects of a
selective high efficacy 5-ht1a agonist, f13714 [44] and
those of the antipsychotics clozapine, ziprasidone and
aripiprazole, partial agonists at 5-ht1a receptors, with d2
antagonist or partial agonist activity, and those of the d2
antagonist haloperidol, lacking of 5-ht1a partial agonist
activity, on kainic acid-induced striatal lesion volume in
c57bl/6n mice. the involvement of  xxxg1108xxx 
stimulation was investigated by comparing the effects on
these non-selective antipsychotics with those obtained with
the selective 5-ht1a agonist f13714 and by antagonism
studies with the selective 5-ht1a antagonist n-[2-[4(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-n-(2-pyridinyl)
cyclohexanecarboxamide (way 100635).

2. materials and methods
2.1. animals
animals were handled and cared for in accordance with
the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals
(national research council, 1996) and the european
directive no 86/609. the experimental protocol was carried
out in compliance with local ethical committee guidelines
for animal research. male c57bl/6n mice (26–28 g, charles
river, elbeuf, france) were housed in groups of 10 with
free access to water and food, under a 12:12-h light/dark
cycle.
2.2. excitotoxic lesions
kainic acid lesions and measurement of lesion volume
by cresyl violet staining were performed as previously

described [17]. twenty-four hours before surgery, mice
were weighed and isolated. mice were anesthetized with
an intraperitoneal (ip) injection of sodium pentobarbital
(65 mg/kg). the body temperature was monitored by a
rectal probe and maintained at 37 8c by a thermostatted
heating pad. kainic acid was dissolved in phosphate
buffered saline (ph 7.4). mice were placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (kopf model 900) and kainic acid (1.0 or
1.25 nmol) or vehicle (pbs 10 mm) were injected in a
volume of 0.3 al into the right striatum according to the
following stereotaxic coordinates: 0.5 mm anterior to
bregma, 2.0 mm lateral to bregma and 3.5 mm ventral
from the skull surface [31]. at the end of the surgery, a
1-ml subcutaneous (sc) injection of 0.9% nacl was made
to prevent dehydration, and mice were placed in a
thermostatted cage (25 8c) until they were completely
awake. the recovery time varied from 2 1/2 to 3 h and
was not affected by the drug treatments (unpublished
observations). during the next 48 h, mice received two
injections of 0.9% nacl per day. ziprasidone and
aripiprazole were prepared in twin 1%, clozapine and
haloperidol were dissolved with 10–20 al lactic acid in
distilled water and ph was adjusted to 4.5–5 by adding
naoh 1 n; f13714 and way100635 were dissolved in
distilled water. antipsychotics, 5-ht1a agonists or vehicle
were administered ip 30 min before and 3.5 h after the
intrastriatal injection of the neurotoxin in order to assure
the presence of the drug in the site of action of the toxin
during the first 6–8 h of kainic acid-induced toxicity [17].
the doses of the antipsychotics were chosen on the basis
of their effects in behavioral models and on neurotransmitters contents or release, in rats and mice
[23,55,69,70,71,]. way100635 was administrated sc 30
before the injection of the antipsychotics or 5-ht1a
agonist. aripiprazole, ziprasidone, f13714 and way
100635 were synthesized at the pierre-fabre research
center. kainic acid, haloperidol and clozapine were
purchased from sigma-aldrich, chimie, france.

2.4. data analysis
data were analyzed using the kruskal–wallis one-way
anova followed by mann–whitney u test (graph pad
prism). in each experiment 10 or 11 control mice received
1 or 1.25 nmol of ka intrastriatum and saline ip, the drug
treatment animals, 9–7 in each group of treatment, received 1
or 1.25 nmol of ka and the drugs ip and/or sc. the mean
control values obtained with ka 1.25 nmol from three
separate experiment did not differ among each other and
were pooled together (n = 31) and used in the statistical
analysis. also the mean control values obtained with ka
1 nmol in four separate experiments did not differ among
each other and were pooled together (n = 39) and used in the
statistical analysis. control lesion volumes obtained with ka
1 nmol were statistically different ( p b 0.001) from the
control lesion volumes obtained with ka 1.25 nmol. it has
been previously shown that fraction of nmol variations in
ka amounts can influence the size of the lesion [17].

3. results
3.1. effects of f13714 on kainic-acid-induced striatal lesion
volume in mice
the effects of the high efficacy, high potency, selective
5-ht1a agonist, f13714 on ka (1.25 mmol)-induced lesion
volume were studied.
f13714 (0.04–10 mg/kg ip) dose-dependently decreased
lesion volume. the minimal effective dose was 2  0.63
mg/kg (fig. 2a). the decrease of lesion-volume (61% of
controls) obtained with f13714 (2  0.63 mg/kg ip) was
antagonized by way 100635 (2  0.63 mg/kg sc). way
100635 did not affect lesion volume when administered
alone (fig. 2b; see also fig. 1).
3.2. effects of antipsychotics on kainic acid-induced striatal
lesion volume in mice

2.3. estimation of lesion volume
mice were killed by decapitation at 48 h after the
intrastriatal injections. brains were dissected and frozen in
isopentane at 45 8c, then stored at 80 8c until
processed. brains were sectioned, starting from the anterior
aspect of the corpus callosum, into 240 sequential rostrocaudal sections of 20 am thickness. these sections
encompassed both the entire span of the lesioned tissue
and the entire striatum. one out of every 10 sections was
collected on polylysine-coated slides, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (0 8c, 30 min) and stained with cresyl violet (1%
cresyl violet acetate in 0.1 m acidic acid, ph 4). the area of
the lesion, indicated by the lack of staining when compared
to the striatum, was measured in each series of sections by
means of an image analysis program (scion image, nih)
and used for volume calculation.

the effects of three atypical antipsychotics clozapine,
ziprasidone and aripiprazole on ka-induced lesion were
investigated and compared with those obtained with
haloperidol.
ziprasidone (2  20 mg/kg ip) decreased ka (1.25 nmol)
-induced lesion volume by 59%. this effect was completely
antagonized by way 100635 (2  0.63 mg/kg sc) (fig. 3). a
loser dose of ziprasidone (2  5 mg/kg ip) did not affect the
lesion volume induced by 1 nmol of ka (lesion volume
mean f sem: control 1.24 f 0.41; ziprasidone 1.25 f 0.47;
n = 9).
clozapine (2  10 mg/kg ip) decreased the lesion
volume induced by 1 nmol of kainic acid, by 72% of
controls, and haloperidol (2  0.16 mg/kg ip) did not (fig.
4a). haloperidol showed a tendency to increase lesion
volume caused by 1 nmol of kainic acid. in a separate

experiment, the effect of clozapine, a decrease of 61%, was
attenuated by way 100635 (2  0.63 mg/kg sc) (fig. 4b).
way 100635 did not affect by itself, ka (1 nmol)-induced
lesion volume (fig. 3b). in a separate experiment a lower
dose of clozapine (2  5 mg/kg ip) and a higher dose of
haloperidol (2  0.32 mg/kg ip) did not affect the lesion
volume induced by 1 nmol of ka (lesion volume mean f
sem: control 1.66 f 0.38; clozapine 1.57 f 0.43;
haloperidol 1.41 f 0.32; n = 8–7).
aripiprazole (0.63–10 mg/kg ip) dose-dependently
decreased ka (1 nmol)-induced lesion volume. aripiprazole showed a tendency to decrease lesion volume at 2 
2.5 mg/kg ip and significantly decreased lesion volume at
2  10 mg/kg ip by 73%. the dose of 2  0.63 mg/kg ip
was ineffective (fig. 5a). the effect of aripiprazole 2 
10 mg/kg ip was completely antagonized by way100635.

4. discussion
in order to investigate the role of  xxxg1108xxx 
stimulation in the potential neuroprotective properties of
antipsychotic agents against kainic acid-induced striatal
lesion, we first studied whether  xxxg1108xxx  stimulation
could protect against kainic acid lesioning of the mouse
striatum in vivo.
4.1. effects of the selective and efficacious 5-ht1a agonist
f13714 on kainic acid-induced lesion volume
the highly selective, efficacious 5-ht1a agonist f13714
[44] protected against ka toxicity at a dose as low as

0.63 mg/kg and its effect was antagonized by way 100635,
indicating that a selective stimulation of 5-ht1a receptors
can protect against ka-induced striatal lesion (fig. 2). the
administration of the agonist (ip) before and after the
injection of ka in the striatum, assured the presence of
the drug in the site of action during at least the first 6–8 h of
ka-induced toxicity when the lesion is not detectable (1 h
after ka) or starts to be detectable by nissl staining (6 h
after ka) but the early degenerative processes initiated by
ka, such as free radicals production and depletion of atp
and nad+, are taking place [16,17,30].
it has been shown that 8-oh dpat can protect
immortalized rat striatal neurons (m213-20 cells) from
nmda-induced apoptosis [48]. however, the mechanisms
underlying the 5-ht1a agonist-induced neuroprotection
against ka-induced striatal lesion might not be direct on
the striatal neurons, in fact  xxxg1108xxx  binding sites are
not detectable in the striatum, and might involve inhibition
of glutamate release from the cortical–striatal afferents
through the action at cortical 5-ht1a receptors (see below).
it has been recently shown that 5-ht1a agonists reduce the
amplitude of ampa evoked currents in pyramidal neurons
of the prefrontal cortex by inhibiting the ca2+/calmodulindependent kinase ii [13], suggesting that  xxxg1108xxx 
stimulation might suppress glutamate release in the prefrontal cortex [52]. however, this control could be extended
to the corticostriatal glutamatergic projections. in fact, it has
been recently shown that 5-ht1a receptors are located on
the proximal fragments of axons of pyramidal glutamatergic
neurons in the rat cingulate cortex [20]. this anatomical
localization may suggest that cortical 5-ht1a receptors are
engaged not only in the modulation of corticocortical

cerebellum, suggesting that protective actions of 5-ht1a
receptor agonists are not mediated directly by an action on
striatal tissue, although this cannot be formally excluded
[48].
4.2. implication of 5-ht1a receptors in glutamatergic
dysfunction in schizophrenia

glutamatergic transmission but also in the control of the
release of glutamate in the innervated subcortical regions
[20]. ka is an axon-sparing neurotoxin and its striatal
toxicity depends on the release of glutamate from the
corticostriatal presynaptic terminals, possibly stimulated by
the interaction of ka with ampa/ka receptors located on
the glutamatergic presynaptic terminals [25]. these recent
anatomical and electrophysiological evidences suggest that
stimulation of 5-ht1a receptors in the cortex could partially
protect against ka-induced striatal lesion. however, autoradiographic studies have shown that the highest number of
 xxxg1108xxx  binding sites is found in the limbic areas of
the brain, in the hippocampus, lateral septum, cortical areas
(such as cingulate cortex) and in the mesencephalic dorsal
and median raphe nuclei. in contrast  xxxg1108xxx 
binding sites are barely detectable in the striatum and

the  xxxg1108xxx  is an important molecular target to
develop drugs that might be beneficial against both positive
and negative symptoms of schizophrenia without producing
extrapyramidal side effect [6,53].  xxxg1108xxx  densities
are increased in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenic
patients, in postmortem studies and these changes were
observed in both medicated and drug free patients [36,73].
as a major proportion of neocortical 5-ht1a receptors
appear to be located on pyramidal, putatively glutamatergic
cells [4,11], the increased receptor number may plausibly
have implications for pyramidal cell function in the illness.
interestingly, cell density and glutamatergic elements have
been reported to be elevated in the prefrontal cortex in
schizophrenia [22]. given their location, the elevation of
prefrontal 5-ht1a receptors may reflect not only an
abnormal glutamatergic network in the cortical region, but
also an abnormal glutamatergic transmission in the subcortical regions.
dysfunction of glutamatergic neurotransmission is believed to play a role in schizophrenia. in particular, excessive
activation of non-nmda receptors, ampa and kainate, by
glutamate might contribute to neuronal degeneration in the
disease. it might be postulated that this either primary or
drug-induced excitotoxicity could be in part responsible for
aggravation of negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in
schizophrenic patients.
for instance, conventional antipsychotics, including
haloperidol, increase extracellular concentration of glutamate in the striatum, whereas clozapine acutely increases
excitatory amino acids in the prefrontal cortex without
affecting striatal glutamate concentration [21,77,78]. the
increase of glutamate in the striatum might increase the risk
of neurotoxicity to structures mediating extrapyramidal
motor functions and particular forms of learning in which
stimulus–response (s-r) associations or habits are incrementally acquired [64]. interestingly, learning impairments
have been previously shown in rats following kainic acidinduced lesions of the striata [26].
although further studies are needed to demonstrate that
the neuroprotective effects of the atypical antipsychotics
tested, ziprasidone, clozapine and aripiprazole might be
beneficial for cognitive impairment or negative symptoms,
these compounds reduced ka-induced striatal lesion volume,
whereas haloperidol did not. the effects of ziprasidone and
aripiprazole were mediated by  xxxg1108xxx  activation.
haloperidol showed tendency to increase lesion volume.

in hela cells expressing  xxxg1108xxx  and to only
partially decrease extracellular 5-ht in the rat hippocampus
 xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg ip [3]. the in vitro effect on camp was
attenuated by way 100635 but the effect in vivo on 5-ht
was not, indicating that the effects of clozapine in this in
vivo model were unlikely to be mediated by 5-ht1a
receptors [3]. on the other hand, clozapine like ziprasidone
has been shown to increase cortical dopamine release and
this effect was partially attenuated by way 100635, indicating that clozapine, like ziprasidone, can affect dopaminergic transmission in the cortex by acting at 5-ht1a
receptors [39].
action at other receptors, including 5-ht2a, might
account for the protective effect of clozapine. in fact,
clozapine also has affinity for 5-ht2a receptors where it
acts as an antagonist. in the cortex 5-ht1a and 5-ht2a

ters contents or release, in rats and mice [23,55,69,70,71]
and on the consideration that 5-ht1a agonist such as
ipsapirone and buspirone have neuroprotective effects in
mice in vivo at doses within the 10–30 mg/kg range [7].
thus, the doses employed fall within the range known to be
active in other pharmacological models.
4.3. actions of ziprasidone, clozapine and haloperidol on
ka-induced striatal lesion
it has been shown that ziprasidone at doses lower than
3.2 mg/kg increased da release from the cortex and
striatum approximately to the same extent while at higher
doses (up to 32 mg/kg) preferentially stimulates da release
from the cortex to similar level of that obtained with 8-oh
dpat [70]. the stimulation of da cortical release obtained
with 10 mg/kg of ziprasidone was significantly attenuated
by way100635 [70]. the two doses of ziprasidone used in
our study, 5 and 20 mg/kg, were in the same range as those
used by rollema et al. [70]. although a 5-ht2a antagonist
component cannot be excluded from the protective action of
ziprasidone against ka-induced lesion volume, at the dose
tested it appears that the protective effect is mostly mediated
by  xxxg1108xxx  stimulation, as demonstrated by its
reversal with way100635 (fig. 3).
clozapine decrease ka-induced lesion volume, but the
effect was only slightly attenuated by way 100635 (fig. 4).
clozapine has been previously described as a 5-ht1a partial
agonist for g-protein activation in recombinant cellular
systems [15,56]. however, clozapine has lower affinity and
lower efficacy than ziprasidone at 5-ht1a receptors [15].
moreover, it has been shown only to partially inhibit, at the
high concentration of 100 am,  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp

receptors are coexpressed in the same neurons [2]. it has
been show that  xxxd2419xxx  protects ca1 hippocampal
neurons against ischemic damage [42] and additive neuroprotection is obtained with the combination of 5-ht2a
antagonism and 5-ht1a agonism [43]. alternatively, in
vitro evidence in pc12 cells might suggest that clozapine’s
protective effect could be due to its ability to modulate the
activity of free radical scavenging enzymes such as the
copper/zinc superoxide dismutase [5,68].
although the protective effects of high-dose clozapine in
pc12 cells are controversial [27], previous studies have
shown that clozapine but not haloperidol protect pc12 cells
against serum withdrawal or mpp+-induced cell death
[5,68]. moreover, clozapine, and other atypical antipsychotics, but not a high dose of haloperidol (10 mg/kg) can
prevent nmda antagonist-induced neuronal vacuolization
of rat retrosplenial cortex, as an index of the neurotoxicity of
the nmda receptor antagonists [60,62]. since high doses of
haloperidol are not neuroprotective and might also have
effects other than  xxxg656xxx  blockade, the doses of
haloperidol used in our study were moderate in order to
selectively inhibit  xxxg656xxx -mediated effects (e.g., apomorphine-induced climbing in mice [23]). the lack of
protective effect of haloperidol against ka-induced lesion
volume showed by our studies is consistent with the lack of
neuroprotective activity shown by haloperidol in previous
studies. moreover, using an amount of ka that caused a
smaller lesion volume, haloperidol showed a tendency to
increase the lesion volume, suggesting neurotoxic potentials
for this drug. haloperidol increases glutamate release in the
striatum [77,78] and could potentiate ka toxicity. moreover, haloperidol can induce death of cortical neurons in
culture with a maximal effect at 30 am and this toxicity was
attenuated by the  xxxg656xxx  agonist bromocriptine and the
5-ht2a antagonist,  xxxd2419xxx  [76]. the mechanisms of
haloperidol-induced toxicity might include caspases activation and free radicals production [32].
4.4. actions of aripiprazole on ka-induced striatal lesion
in a study by semba et al. [71] aripiprazole was tested at
0.5, 2.5, 10 and 40 mg/kg. it was shown to dose dependently antagonize apomorphine-induced stereotyped behavior
and to slightly affect da and its metabolites in both frontal
cortex and striatum [71]. in mice aripiprazole (1–30 mg) did
not affect striatal dopamine and slightly increased  xxxd1891xxx  mg
dopac/dopamine ratios and hva/da ratios at 3–10 mg
[55]. the doses used in our study are included within the
range mentioned above.
aripiprazole dose-dependently decreased ka-induced
lesion volume (fig. 5). although the dose of 2  0.63
mg/kg was ineffective, the higher dose of 2  10 mg/kg
significantly decreased lesion volume. this effect was
completely antagonized by way100635. on the other
hand, in other models, aripiprazole appears to achieve
5-ht1a-mediated effects at doses lower that those used in

fig. 5. (a) aripiprazole dose-dependently reduced kainic-acid (1 nmol)induced lesion volume, and (b) this effect was antagonized by
way100635. aripiprazole 2  0.63–10 mg/kg ip. values are mean f
sem. n = 39 for the group of controls; n = 9 for the drug treatment groups.

wallis one-way anova followed by mann–whitney u test.

the present study [46]. discrepancies among doses of
aripiprazole producing a 5-ht1a-mediated effect might
be due to species differences, rats versus mice, and/or on
the experimental model, neurotransmitter release versus
neuroprotection.
aripiprazole, like ziprasidone, has more affinity for
both human recombinant and rat 5-ht1a receptors than
clozapine [57,72]. in our studies, the protective effects of
aripiprazole (2  10 mg/kg) were completely antagonized
by way100635. in contrast, the protection induced by an
equal dose of clozapine was only partially attenuated by
the same antagonist, consistent with a higher affinity of
aripiprazole for 5-ht1a receptors. on the other hand,
aripiprazole has less affinity, potency and efficacy at both
human recombinant and rat 5-ht1a receptors than f13714
([44,57,72] and unpublished observations). correspondingly, aripiprazole displayed its 5-ht1a-mediated protective effect at a dose that was about 15 times higher than

c. cosi et al. / brain research 1043 (2005) 32–41

the minimal active dose of f13714 producing an effect
similar to that of aripiprazole.
aripiprazole is also a high affinity d2 partial agonist [12]
and a d3 and d4 partial agonist a well as a 5-ht2a
antagonist [53]. previous evidence showed that aripiprazole
at the doses of 3–10 or 40 mg/kg decreases dopamine
release from the ventral striatum and medial prefrontal
cortex [46,71] and increases dopac and hva at 2.5–10 in
the striatum, which returned to control levels at 40 mg/kg
[71]. the decrease of striatal dopamine release caused by
aripiprazole 2.5–10 mg/kg [46,71] is consistent with an
agonist action at d2/d3 autoreceptors in both dorsal and
ventral striatum. for example quinpirole, a d2/ xxxg657xxx 
agonist, also decreases dopamine release in the striatum and
nucleus accumbens [79]. it has been shown that  xxxg656xxx 
agonism does not protect striatal neurons against kainate
receptor-mediated glutamate cytotoxicity in vitro [1]. on the
other hand pramipexole, a d2/ xxxg657xxx  agonist, has
protective effects against postischemic or methamphetamine-induced degeneration of nigrostriatal neurons [34].
combined blockade of d2 and 5-ht2a receptors might also
favor  xxxg1108xxx  stimulation [39]. in fact risperidone
and olanzapine increase cortical da release and this effect is
reversed by way100635 [39].
in conclusion, a d3 agonist, and/or 5-ht2a components
in the aripiprazole protective effect against ka-induced
striatal lesion volume, cannot be excluded.
4.5. conclusion
the neuroprotective actions displayed by the atypical
antipsychotics tested in the present study, whether mediated
by  xxxg1108xxx  stimulation or other mechanisms,
indicate that these drugs can protect against excitotoxicity
in vivo. these findings may be relevant to the actions of
atypical antipsychotics against the negative symptoms and
cognitive deficits observed in schizophrenic patients.
