abstract
background:
studies of the anticoagulant effects of hirudin, which is derived from the
saliva of the leech hirudo medicinalis, led to the development of compounds that can directly inhibit thrombin activity without the need for additional cofactors. one of these is
the direct thrombin inhibitor  xxxd348xxx , which has recently been approved by the us
food and drug administration for use as an anticoagulant in patients with unstable angina
undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.
objective: this is a review of the pharmacologic properties, efficacy, tolerability, and
potential cost-effectiveness of  xxxd348xxx  in the treatment of ischemic coronary syndromes.
methods: articles were identified by searches of medline (1966september
2001)
international pharmaceutical abstracts (197&september
2001), and the iowa drug information service (1966-september
2001) using the terms  xxxd348xxx  and hirulog. the reference lists of retrieved articles were also reviewed for relevant articles.
results:  xxxd348xxx  is a synthetic polypeptide that directly inhibits thrombin by binding simultaneously
to its active catalytic site and its substrate recognition site. after intravenous administration,
peak plasma concentrations
occur in 2 minutes. in patients
given a l.o-mg/kg bolus followed by a 2.5-mg/kg per hour infusion, a median activated
clotting time of 346 seconds is achieved with little interpatient or intrapatient variability.
clearance of  xxxd348xxx  occurs through a combination of renal elimination and proteolytic cleavage, and doses may need to be decreased in the presence of renal dysfunction.
in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions,  xxxd348xxx  has been associated with equivalent efficacy but lower bleeding rates (p < 0.001) than unfractionated heparin (ufh). data from the hirulog early reperfusion/occlusion-2
study suggest no
reduction in mortality with  xxxd348xxx  compared with heparin when either is added to aspirin and streptokinase in patients with acute myocardial infarction, despite a lower rein-

farction rate (p < 0.001). experience with
 xxxd348xxx 
in patients
with unstable
angina and heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia (hit), as well as in patients receiving glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitors, is
limited. the differences in bleeding rates
between  xxxd348xxx  and heparin in published clinical trials probably reflect differences
in levels of anticoagulation
achieved in comparator groups.
conclusions: given its high cost,  xxxd348xxx  should be reserved for use as an
alternative to ufh, primarily in patients
with hit, until clinical trials have more
clearly demonstrated its benefits in terms
of efficacy or safety.

introduction
the disruption
of an atherosclerotic
plaque, with subsequent formation of an
occlusive thrombus, is the pivotal mechanism underlying the development of many
acute ischemic cardiovascular events.’ in
acute coronary syndromes
(acs), the
combination of fibrin-degrading
metalloproteinases released from inflammatory
cells and the shear stress from altered
blood flow causes spontaneous rupture, or
fissure, of a lipid-rich plaque.’ the release of various thrombogenic substances
from the lipid core stimulates platelet activation and clot formation, causing total
or near-total occlusion of the vessel. ischemia of the myocardial tissues supplied by
the affected artery ensues, and the patient
develops the clinical manifestations of unstable angina or myocardial
infarction
(mi)? a similar process may contribute
to the phenomenon of early vessel closure
after percutaneous coronary interventions

(pci) such as balloon angioplasty,
in
which the introduction
of thrombogenic
materials combined with mechanical injury to the atherosclerotic
plaque and
arterial wall may activate the clotting
cascade.3
in light of what is now understood about
the pathophysiology of ischemic coronary
syndromes, current strategies for reducing
the incidence of these cardiovascular events
have focused primarily on the use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents to modulate the clotting cascade and prevent the
formation of coronary thrombus. antiplatelet therapy with aspirin has been the
standard of care for acs since results of
the second international study of infarct
survival (isis-2)4 demonstrated a reduction in mortality equivalent to that with
streptokinase in patients presenting with
acute mi. recent advances in the understanding of platelet physiology have led to
development of newer antiplatelet therapies, including
adenosine
diphosphate
(adp) inhibitors (eg, clopidogrel, ticlopidine) and glycoprotein iib/iiia (gp iib/iiia)
inhibitors
(eg,  xxxd53xxx ,
 xxxd2017xxx ,
 xxxd3385xxx ). the addition of these newer antiplatelet agents to standard regimens containing aspirin and anticoagulants has further decreased the incidence of adverse
cardiovascular events in patients presenting with acs or undergoing pci.5-7
unlike therapies directed at platelet inhibition, however, anticoagulant
therapy
for ischemic coronary syndromes has remained relatively unchanged for years.
historically, unfractionated heparin (ufh)
has been the anticoagulant
of choice
because of its immediate
onset of action when administered intravenously and
its inexpensive acquisition cost (-$3.50/
30,000-u vial).8,9 however, the use of ufh
has several drawbacks
that may limit

39

clinical therapeutics@

its effectiveness in the treatment of arterial thrombosis.10 ufh inhibits thrombin
indirectly, primarily by binding to antithrombin and accelerating the activity of
this natural anticoagulant.‘o
because of
this, the efftcacy of ufh may be reduced
in patients with antithrombin deficiency.
in addition, the ufh-antithrombin
complex is unable to inactivate clot-bound
thrombin and platelet-bound activated  xxxg741xxx  ( xxxg741xxx ), which may be important sources of continuing thrombus formation during acs.“~t2 finally, ufh
exhibits nonspecific
binding
to many
plasma proteins, including histidine-rich
glycoprotein,  xxxg1726xxx , and acutephase reactants such as  xxxg2422xxx  and fibronectin, which limits its ability to inactivate clotting factors.” this contributes
to a variable dose response and a need for
frequent monitoring to ensure an appropriate level of anticoagulation.
the clinical impact of these potential pharmacologic limitations is demonstrated
in the
persistent adverse-event rates in patients
with acs treated with ufh and current
antiplatelet agents. despite use of various
combinations
of aspirin, adp inhibitors,
gp iib/iiia inhibitors, and ufh, the incidence of death and/or mi at 30 days remains -10% in patients presenting with
acs.6jj
these findings have prompted development of newer anticoagulants that do not
have the limitations associated with ufh.
one approach that has been investigated
is the use of direct thrombin inhibitors.
these agents do not require the presence
of antithrombin
and act either through
binding to thrombin’s active catalytic site
or by preventing thrombin from interacting with its substrates.”
the prototype
direct thrombin inhibitor is hirudin, a
65amino
acid polypeptide originally ob-

40

tained from the salivary glands of the
leech hirudo medicinalis.’
study of
hirudin’s binding characteristics to thrombin led eventually
to development
of
smaller synthetic compounds
that contained only the essential domains needed
for thrombin binding and inhibition. one
of these compounds,
 xxxd348xxx *
(originally named hirulog), has been investigated in several clinical trials as a possible
alternative to heparin in the management
of acs and pci.
this paper reviews the pharmacologic
properties, efficacy, tolerability, and potential cost-effectiveness
of  xxxd348xxx  in
the treatment of ischemic coronary syndromes. relevant articles were identified
through a search of medline (1966september 2001), international
pharmaceutical abstracts (197wseptember 2001)
and the iowa drug information
service
(1966-september
2001) using the terms
 xxxd348xxx  and hirulog. additional publications were identified by reviewing the
reference lists of retrieved articles. unpublished data were requested from the
manufacturer.

thrombogenesis
thrombus formation at the site of arterial
injury involves a complex interaction of
platelets, proteins, and various cellular
constituents.
as mentioned earlier, rupture, or fissure, of an atherosclerotic
plaque exposes the blood to various
thrombogenic
substances, including  xxxg748xxx  (tf) and collagen. tf binds to
circulating factor viia, initiating the extrinsic pathway of the clotting cascade by
forming a tf-viia complex that is capa*trademark:  xxxd348xxx @ (the medicines company,
cambridge, massachusetts).

ble of activating factors vii, ix, and x.16
the intrinsic pathway can be initiated simultaneously through activation of factor
xii to factor xiia by collagen. factor xiia
catalyzes production of factor ixa, which
assembles with  xxxg751xxx  and ca*+ on
the surface of activated platelets to form
the tenase complex. i7 the 2 coagulation
pathways converge at this point, with both
the tenase complex and tf-viia complex
activating  xxxg741xxx  to  xxxg741xxx . at this
point,  xxxg741xxx  amplifies its own production through activation of  xxxg750xxx , further potentiating the clotting cascade. the
association on membrane surfaces of  xxxg741xxx  with  xxxg749xxx  and ca*+ constitutes
the  xxxg741xxx 
complex, which converts prothrombin to thrombin. i3
thrombin plays a central role in the
regulation of thrombus formation. after
its production by the  xxxg741xxx  complex, thrombin dissociates from the membrane surface and converts fibrinogen to
fibrin monomers in the plasma. thrombin
can then bind to fibrin in the developing
clot, where it is protected from inactivation by antithrombin.15 thrombin also activates factor xiii to  xxxg744xxx , which
is responsible for cross-linking the fibrin
monomers and thus stabilizing the clot.
similarly to  xxxg741xxx , thrombin is able to
potentiate its own generation and amplify
the clotting cascade by activating factors
v and viii and stimulating production of
tf by various cells. i6 thrombin is also a
potent activator of platelets, causing a conformational change in the gp iib/iiia receptors on the platelet surface that allows
them to bind to fibrinogen during the final
common pathway in platelet aggregation.2
besides its procoagulant actions, thrombin is also involved in regulating the endogenous thrombolytic system. by binding to  xxxg2277xxx , thrombin activates

protein c, which inactivates factors va and
viiia. i7 thrombin also stimulates the production by endothelial cells of tf pathway inhibitor, which interrupts the clotting cascade, and tissue plasminogen
activator, which promotes fibrinolysis.16
thrombin’s procoagulant activity may
be interrupted
through several mechanisms. the naturally circulating inhibitors
antithrombin and  xxxg2057xxx  inactivate unbound thrombin, but they are not
effective against clot-bound thrombin and
require the use of heparin for maximal efficiency. i8 plasmin inactivates prothrombin and interrupts the production of thrombin.i6 thrombin’s
effects may also be
reduced through dilution in the circulation and through uptake and internalization by various cells.‘6 because of its
important role in regulating thrombus formation, however, thrombin is a primary
target of pharmacologic interventions during the treatment of ischemic coronary
syndromes.

mechanism
of action
of  xxxd348xxx 
activated thrombin contains several specific binding sites that allow it to interact
with its various substrates. the active catalytic site is a serine-containing
pocket
that cleaves the peptide bonds in inactive
clotting factors and converts them to their
active forms. studies by fenton et ali9
demonstrated the existence of a substrate
recognition
site (known as the anionbinding exosite, or exosite 1) near the active catalytic site that orients fibrinogen in
the proper position and allows thrombin
to bind to fibrin in a clot.  xxxd348xxx  inhibits thrombin activity by binding to both
the active catalytic site and this substrate
recognition site.‘”

clinical

the chemical structure of  xxxd348xxx  is
depicted in figure 1.  xxxd348xxx  is a synthetic 20-amino acid polypeptide that was
developed based on studies of the interaction of hirudin with thrombin.  xxxd348xxx ’s structure can be divided into 3
distinct domains. the first contains the
12-amino acid carboxyl terminal region
of hirudin, which was found to be necessary for binding to exosite 1 of thrombin.
the second domain contains a 4-amino
acid sequence (o-phe-pro-arg-pro)
that
binds to the active catalytic site. finally, a
linking region consisting
of 4 glycine
residues maintains the optimal distance
between the other 2 domains, allowing simultaneous binding of the 2 sites2c initially,  xxxd348xxx  binds noncompetitively
to thrombin through its interaction with
both the active site and exosite 1. however, thrombin slowly cleaves the arg3pro4 bond in the active-site domain and
eventually regains its catalytic activity.
although the carboxyl-terminal
portion
of  xxxd348xxx  remains bound to exosite 1,
its binding is of lower affinity than that of
the intact  xxxd348xxx  polypeptide and can
be displaced in a competitive
manner.
therefore,  xxxd348xxx  produces only transient inhibition of thrombin (figure 2)‘”
unlike heparin,  xxxd348xxx  inhibits the
activity of both circulating and clot-bound
thrombin. heparin exhibits its anticoagulant activity by binding to antithrombin
via a unique pentasaccharide
sequence.*’
to inactivate thrombin, heparin must bind
to both antithrombin and thrombin (through
a separate binding site, exosite 2), linking
the 2 and accelerating the activity of antithrombin.
in the case of clot-bound
thrombin, however, heparin simultaneously binds to exosite 2 on thrombin and
to fibrin, forming a heparin-thrombinfibrin complex that is protected from in-

42

therapeutics”

activation by antithrombin.i5  xxxd348xxx ,
on the other hand, can inhibit both circulating and clot-bound thrombin by blocking the active site and preventing the binding of thrombin to fibrin, which has only
weak affinity for thrombin in the absence
of heparin.
the differences were demonstrated in
an in vitro study by maraganore et a1,22
which investigated the effects of heparin
and  xxxd348xxx  on both soluble and clotbound thrombin. thrombin activity was
measured using an assay for  xxxg784xxx , the fragment released by the cleavage of fibrin by thrombin. heparin and  xxxd348xxx  produced similar inhibition of
soluble thrombin activity when tested at
respective concentrations of 0.1 u/ml and
1.o kmol/l. however, when the same concentrations were tested in the presence of
clot-bound thrombin, heparin’s inhibitory
activity was markedly reduced, whereas
 xxxd348xxx ’s inhibitory activity remained
unchanged.
also in contrast to ufh,  xxxd348xxx 
does not bind to other circulating plasma
proteins and is not affected by neutralizing factors released by activated platelets
such as  xxxg1726xxx .2’ by inhibiting
thrombin activity,  xxxd348xxx 
also indirectly inhibits activation of factors v, viii,
and x, and prevents thrombin-induced
platelet activation.2’

cussed more fully in the “clinical trials”
section). in a dose-ranging study in 55 patients with unstable angina, liddn et alz4
reported that increasing infusion rates of
 xxxd348xxx 
correlated closely with prolongation of the aptt (r = 0.95) at doses
ranging from 0.25 to 1.0 mg/kg per hour.
the coefficient of variation for aptt response in individual patients receiving the
same dose ranged from 11% to 20% for
the 3 doses studied, whereas the variability in aptt response in individual patients
was 6.2% to 11.9% over the 72-hour study
period.
in a study by top01 et al” in 291 patients undergoing
coronary angioplasty
(described in the “clinical trials” section),
aptt and act indicated a similar doseresponse relationship with infusions of  xxxd348xxx  ranging from 0.6 to 2.5 mg/kg
per hour (p < 0.001 between each group).
in 12 additional patients who received
a bolus dose of 1.0 mg/kg followed by
an infusion of 2.5 mg/kg per hour, all
reached maximal act levels of >300 seconds, with an average act of 367 seconds
at steady state.25 similarly, in the hirulog
angioplasty study26 (has) in 43 i2 patients undergoing angioplasty for unstable
or postinfarction
angina, administration
of  xxxd348xxx 
as a bolus of 1.0 mg/kg
followed by an infusion of 2.5 mglkg
per hour resulted in a median act of 346
seconds. these data suggest that when
given according to the regimen recommended by its manufacturer,
 xxxd348xxx 
typically produces an act of -350 seconds, with little interpatient or intrapatient
variability.

of  xxxd348xxx 

 xxxd348xxx  achieves peak plasma concentrations within 2 minutes after intra-

venous bolus administration.27
subcutaneous administration
of  xxxd348xxx 
to
healthy volunteers resulted in lower peak
concentrations,
which occurred within 1
to 2 hours after injection, and an absolute
bioavailability ranging from 40% to 80%.27

is cleared from the body
through a combination of renal elimination
and proteolytic cleavage. the polypeptide
is filtered at the glomerulus and secreted
into the proximal tubule before being reabsorbed in the distal tubule, where it is
degraded by the actions of lysosomes.28
the mean total body clearance is -3.4
ml/kg per minute, and the elimination
half-life is 25 to 30 minutes in patients
with normal renal function (glomerular
filtration rate [gfr] 260 ml/min).2’ patients with more advanced renal dysfunction exhibit decreased clearance of  xxxd348xxx ,
with a mean half-life of 34
minutes in patients with moderate renal
impairment (gfr 30-59 ml/min) and 57
minutes in patients with severe renal impairment (gfr lo-29 ml/min).2” in a
small sample of 12 dialysis-dependent
patients, the clearance and *alf-life of  xxxd348xxx  were 1.04 ml/kg per minute
and 3.5 hours, respectively.28  xxxd348xxx  is only partially (-25%) removed by
hemodialysis.*”
 xxxd348xxx  does not appear to be metabolized to any appreciable degree. no
dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with hepatic insufficiency, although
caution is warranted because of the potential for coagulation disorders and the
limited amount of information on the use
of  xxxd348xxx  in these patients.23

clinical trials
coronary angioplusty
top01 et al3 investigated the effects of
 xxxd348xxx 
in 29 i patients undergoing
elective coronary angioplasty in a sequential dose-ranging study. patients were assigned to receive 1 of 5 intravenous doses
of  xxxd348xxx : 0.15-mg/kg bolus and 0.6mg/kg per hour infusion (group i); 0.25
mg/kg bolus and l.o-mg/kg per hour infusion (group 2); 0.35-mg/kg bolus and
1.4-mg/kg per hour infusion (group 3);
0.45-mgkg bolus and 1.8-mgkg per hour
infusion (group 4); or 0.55-mgkg
bolus
and 2.2-mg/kg per hour infusion (group 5).
the bolus was given immediately before
balloon dilation, and the infusion was continued for 4 hours. a maintenance
infusion of 0.2 mgikg per hour could be continued for an additional 20 hours at the
discretion of the investigator. all patients
received aspirin 325 mgld before the procedure, and heparin was withheld until
the 4-hour  xxxd348xxx  infusion had been
completed or the patient developed abrupt
vessel closure. the primary end point of
the study was the incidence of abrupt vessel closure, defined as angiographically
determined cessation of flow that was associated with ischemic pain and electrocardiographic*changes
and was not relieved by nitroglycerin.
differences
in
incidence of the primary end point were
analyzed by comparing
the combined
rates of abrupt vessel closure in groups 1
to 3 (lower-dose groups) with those in
groups 4 and 5 (higher-dose groups).
of the 291 patients enrolled, 279 underwent angioplasty and received doses
of  xxxd348xxx . there were no significant
differences between groups at baseline. in
the intent-to-treat
analysis, abrupt vessel
closure occurred in 11.3% of patients in

46

the lower-dose groups, compared with
3.9% of patients in the higher-dose groups
(p = 0.052). in an on-treatment analysis,
which included data only from those patients who received angioplasty and  xxxd348xxx , abrupt vessel closure occurred in
10.2% and 3.3% of patients in the low- and
high-dose groups, respectively (p = 0.032).
there was no significant correlation between the level of anticoagulation and the
development of abrupt vessel closure, although the small number of patients may
have limited the ability of this study to
detect any meaningful differences. no patients developed severe or life-threatening
bleeding during the study period, and only
1 patient (in group 1) required a transfusion of packed red blood cells. there did
not appear to be any relation between the
dose of  xxxd348xxx  and the development
of any bleeding event.’
has26 was a combined analysis of 2
parallel studies comparing
 xxxd348xxx 
with heparin in patients undergoing urgent angioplasty for unstable angina or
postinfarction
angina. the 2 studies included 43 12 patients randomized in doubleblind fashion to receive either intravenous
 xxxd348xxx  or ufh. patients were stratified according to whether they had unstable angina or postinfarction angina at the
time of enrollment.
 xxxd348xxx  was administered as a l.omg/kg bolus, followed by a 2.5-mg/kg per
hour infusion for 4 hours and a o. xxxd1270xxx /kg
per hour infusion for an additional 14 to
20 hours. ufh was given as a 175-u/kg
bolus followed by a 15-u/kg per hour infusion for 18 to 24 hours. act levels were
measured in all patients 5 minutes and 45
minutes after administration of the bolus.
patients in the ufh group were scheduled to receive additional boluses of 60
u/kg if the act was <350 seconds, whereas

t.d. gladwell

patients in the  xxxd348xxx  group received
placebo (saline) boluses to maintain blinding. all patients received 300 to 325 mg
aspirin during the study. 26
the primary end point of has was the
combined incidence of in-hospital death,
mi, abrupt vessel closure, and rapid clinical deterioration requiring bypass surgery, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, or repeat angioplasty. of the 4312
patients enrolled in the study, 4098 underwent angioplasty and were included in
the final analysis. there were no significant differences in baseline characteristics
between the 2 groups. the median act
level 5 minutes after the initial bolus was
significantly higher in the ufh-treated
patients (383 vs 346 seconds; p < 0.001).
the primary end point occurred in 11.4%
of  xxxd348xxx -treated patients compared
with 12.2% of ufh-treated patients, a difference that was not statistically significant. there were also no significant differences in the individual outcomes of
death, mi, or acute vessel closure between
the 2 groups. when the data were analyzed separately for the group of patients
with postinfarction angina,  xxxd348xxx 
was associated with a lower incidence
of the primary end point (9.1% vs 14.2%;
p = 0.04), primarily due to a reduction in
the risk of mi (2.0% vs 5.1%; p = 0.04).
however, follow-up data at up to 6 months
did not demonstrate any significant difference between the 2 groups in the incidence of ischemic complications, either
in the entire cohort or in the postinfarction patients. 26
in terms of safety,  xxxd348xxx  was associated with a significantly lower incidence of major hemorrhage (3.8% vs 9.8%;
p < 0.001), need for transfusion (3.7%
vs 8.6%; p < 0.001), and retroperitoneal bleeding (0.2% vs 0.7%; p = 0 . 0 2 ) . 26

because this finding could have resulted
from the higher mean act in the ufh
group, a retrospective subgroup analysis
was performed to match patients according to their degree of anticoagulation. patients were stratified into 1 of 6 groups
according to the act level achieved during pci: act <200 seconds, act 200 to
300 seconds, act 301 to 350 seconds,
act 351 to 400 seconds, act 401 to 450
seconds, and act >450 seconds. the incidence of clinically significant bleeding
(defined as overt bleeding requiring transfusion of >2 u, reduction in hemoglobin
of >3 g/dl, intracranial hemorrhage, or
retroperitoneal hemorrhage) in bivalirudintreated patients was then compared with
that in heparin-treated patients in each
stratum.  xxxd348xxx -treated patients had a
significantly lower incidence of clinically
significant bleeding (p < 0.01) than did
heparin-treated patients in all groups, with
the exception of the group with act <200
seconds. 29 the has investigators concluded that use of  xxxd348xxx  during coronary angioplasty had similar efficacy to
use of heparin, but at a lower risk of major bleeding complications. 26
the clinical trial data cited in the us
food and drug administration (fda)approved labeling for  xxxd348xxx  include an intent-to-treat analysis of data
from the has trial, including all 4312
enrolled patients who received  xxxd348xxx  or heparin. 25 in this analysis, the
incidence of death, mi, or revascularization was reduced by 22% in patients treated with  xxxd348xxx  compared
with those treated with heparin (6.2% vs
7.9%; or = 0.78; 95% ci = 0.620.99; p = 0.039). the incidence of major hemorrhage remained essentially unchanged (3.5%  xxxd348xxx , 9.3% heparin;
p < 0.001).

similarly, bitt1 and feit30 reported results of the intent-to-treat analysis of data
from the postinfarction subset of patients
enrolled in the has trial. in this reanalysis of the original data, the incidence of
the primary end point remained significantly lower in  xxxd348xxx -treated
patients
compared with heparin-treated
patients
(5.1% vs 10.8%; or = 0.45; 95% ci =
0.25-0.79;
p = 0.004). however, there
was still no significant difference in the
incidence of ischemic events in the 6month follow-up period (16% vs 18%).
in a nested substudy of the has trial,
burchenal et a13’ investigated the effects
of  xxxd348xxx 
on the occurrence of restenosis in 244 patients undergoing angioplasty. all patients were originally
enrolled in the has trial and were randomized to receive either  xxxd348xxx  or
heparin, as described previously. patients
in this substudy were scheduled to return
for follow-up angiography 6 months after
the original procedure to determine the
effects on target-vessel
lumen diameter
and restenosis rates. at the time the has
trial was completed, 87 patients had undergone repeat angiography
(37  xxxd348xxx , 50 heparin). the mean age of
 xxxd348xxx -treated
patients was significantly higher than that of heparin-treated
patients (65 vs 60 years; p = 0.04), but
there were no other significant differences
in baseline characteristics between the 2
groups. the primary end point, the incidence of restenosis (defined as stenosis of
250% in lumen diameter at follow-up),
occurred in similar percentages
of bivalirudinand heparin-treated
patients
(62.2% and 58.0%, respectively).
although this study was underpowered
to
detect a minimally significant difference
in restenosis rates between the 2 groups,
the investigators concluded that the data

48

did not support a potential benefit of  xxxd348xxx  over heparin in reduction of
restenosis rates.
in another subgroup analysis of the
original has data, shah et als2 attempted
to determine whether use of  xxxd348xxx  resulted in lower ischemic complication rates
than heparin in patients undergoing angioplasty for thrombus-containing
lesions.
of the original 4098 patients in the has
trial who underwent angioplasty, 567 had
evidence of a thrombus-containing
lesion
(301  xxxd348xxx , 266 heparin). in this cohort
of patients at baseline, the bivalirudintreated group was less likely to have received heparin before enrollment in the
study (34% vs 46%; p = 0.004) and was
less likely to have experienced chest pain
at rest within 48 hours before angioplasty
(64% vs 72%; p = 0.05). other baseline
characteristics were not significantly different between groups. in the comparison
between patients with thrombus-containing lesions and those without thrombuscontaining lesions, the incidences of mi
(5.1% vs 3.2%; p = 0.03) and abrupt vessel closure (13.6% vs 8.3%; p < 0.001)
were significantly
higher in those who
had a thrombus on initial angiography.
however,  xxxd348xxx  did not confer any
benefit over heparin in patients with
thrombus-containing
lesions. on the primary end point of death, mi, or repeat
revascularization,
there was no difference
between the  xxxd348xxx  and heparin groups
at 6-month follow-up (26.9% vs 27.1%).
since publication of the has trial26 in
1995, the use of stents, thienopyridines,
and gp iib/iiia inhibitors has become the
standard of care for patients undergoing
pci. in addition, results from the evaluation in percutaneous transluminal

blockade (epilog),3’ which investigated
the use of low-dose heparin in combination with the gp iib/iiia inhibitor  xxxd53xxx  in patients undergoing
urgent or
elective pci, demonstrated
that a lower
level of anticoagulation
(70-u/kg heparin
bolus titrated to an act of 200-250 seconds) was associated with similar efficacy
but reduced bleeding rates compared with
a standard level of anticoagulation
(1 oou/kg heparin bolus titrated to an act of
300-350 seconds). thus, use of  xxxd348xxx  at the recommended
dose might
achieve higher levels of anticoagulation
than necessary in patients receiving concomitant gp iib/iiia inhibitors.
the effect of lower doses of  xxxd348xxx 
on act and clinical outcomes was assessed in the comparison of  xxxd53xxx 
complications
with hirulog ischemic
events trial (cachet).25 in this openlabel phase ii/iii study, 208 patients undergoing elective pc1 were randomized to
1 of 3 groups: heparin (70-u/kg bolus
titrated to an act of 200-300 seconds)
and  xxxd53xxx 
(0.25mg/kg
bolus and
0.125-kg/kg
per minute infusion);
 xxxd348xxx  0.5-mg/kg bolus followed by
1.75-mg/kg
per hour infusion;
or  xxxd348xxx  0.75-mg/kg bolus followed by
1.75mg/kg per hour infusion. patients in
the  xxxd348xxx  groups could receive  xxxd53xxx  at the discretion of the investigator. all patients received aspirin, and a
thienopyridine
was administered
whenever a stent was placed (-88% of patients).
 xxxd53xxx  was used in 24% of patients
receiving  xxxd348xxx .
the median act
levels in the lower- and higher-dose  xxxd348xxx  groups were 302 seconds and
324 seconds, respectively. patients treated
with  xxxd348xxx  had a lower incidence of
the combined end point of mi, revascularization, or major hemorrhage compared

with those treated with heparin (3.5% vs
14.1%, p = 0.013). major hemorrhage occurred in 6.3% of heparin-treated patients
compared with 1.4% of  xxxd348xxx -treated
patients.
although these data suggest that lower
doses of  xxxd348xxx 
than are recommended in the fda-approved
labeling
may be more appropriate for use in patients receiving a gp iib/iiia inhibitor
while undergoing pci, further testing is
still needed to confirm this. results of the
ongoing randomized evaluation in percutaneous coronary intervention linking
 xxxd348xxx 
to reduced clinical events
(replace) study, a phase iii, randomized, open-label study comparing the combination of  xxxd348xxx  or heparin with a
gp iib/iiia inhibitor during angioplasty,
should help resolve this issue.

unstable angina
initially, the utility of  xxxd348xxx  in the
treatment of unstable angina was assessed
in 2 pilot studies. lidon et al24 administered increasing doses of  xxxd348xxx 
to
patients with a documented
history of
coronary artery disease and chest pain at
rest within 24 hours before enrollment.
all patients received an initial infusion of
0.25 mg/kg per hour for 72 hours. this
dose was continued until 2 episodes of
clinical failure had occurred, defined by
the presence of hemodynamic
deterioration, new mi, or recurrent ischemic pain.
subsequent doses were increased until a
dosing regimen
was established
that
achieved a 95% success rate (defined as
ii patient in 20 experiencing clinical failure at a given dose). of 40 patients enrolled in this part of the trial, 5 (i 2.5%)
developed recurrent chest pain. no deaths
or mis were reported. an infusion rate of

49

clinical therapeutics@

1.0 mg/kg per hour was associated with a
95% success rate, with only 1 patient in
21 developing recurrent chest pain. in a
separate open-label study in 20 patients
with unstable angina, sharma et a134 administered  xxxd348xxx  as a continuous infusion of 0.2 mg/kg per hour for 5 days to
maintain an aptt of 2 times control values. there were no reported cases of death
or mi, although 1 patient developed refractory angina during the study. no reports of major bleeding occurred in either
study.
the thrombin inhibition
in myocardial ischemia (timi)tria135 investigated
the use of  xxxd348xxx  in 410 patients with
unstable angina. patients were randomly
assigned in double-blind
fashion to receive 1 of 4 doses of  xxxd348xxx 
(0.02,
0.25, 0.5, or 1.o mg/kg per hour) to be infused over 72 hours. all patients received
 xxxd234xxx /d, and heparin use was not
allowed until after the infusion of  xxxd348xxx  was completed. the primary end
point was the incidence of death, mi, rapid
clinical deterioration, or recurrent ischemic pain during the infusion period. this
occurred in 8.1%, 6.2%, 11.4%, and 6.2%
of patients receiving 0.02, 0.25, 0.5, and
1.0 mg/kg per hour, respectively. when
events were combined for the 3 higherdose groups, the incidence of the secondary end point of death or mi was significantly lower in the group so formed
than in the lowest-dose group (3.2% vs
10.0%; p = 0.008). major hemorrhage occurred in 2 patients during the trial, 1 in
the group receiving 0.5 mg/kg per hour
and 1 in the group receiving 1.0 mg/kg
per hour. because this trial did not include
a true control group, it is not possible to
determine the benefit of  xxxd348xxx  in patients with unstable angina. a follow-up
study, the timi- trial,36 was designed to

50

address this weakness through direct comparison of  xxxd348xxx  and heparin; however, the trial was terminated after enrollment of 133 patients because the original
sponsor temporarily abandoned development of the drug. at this time, the efficacy of  xxxd348xxx  in the treatment of unstable angina remains unresolved.

st-segment elevation myocardial
infarction
the use of  xxxd348xxx  as an adjunct to
thrombolytic therapy in the treatment of
acute mi was tested initially in an angiographic study by theroux et a1.s7 sixtyeight patients with st-segment elevation
mi and no contraindications
to the use of
thrombolytic
agents were randomly assigned in double-blind fashion to receive
low-dose  xxxd348xxx  (0.5 mg/kg per hour),
high-dose  xxxd348xxx  ( 1.o mgkg per hour),
or heparin (5000-u bolus followed by an
infusion of 1000-u/h). infusions of the
study drugs were given for a total of 12
hours. all patients received  xxxd234xxx /d
in addition to streptokinase 1.5 million u
infused over 45 to 60 minutes. at the end
of the study-drug infusion, patients treated
with low-dose  xxxd348xxx  received a continuous infusion of 0.1 mg/kg per hour,
whereas those treated with high-dose  xxxd348xxx  received placebo. coronary angiography was performed 60 to 90 minutes
after administration
of streptokinase and
again 4 to 6 days later.
the primary end point of the study was
timi grade 3 flow at 90 and 120 minutes
after the initiation of streptokinase. at 90
minutes, tim1 grade 3 flow was observed
in 85% of the low-dose  xxxd348xxx  group,
compared with 61% (p = 0.048) in the
high-dose  xxxd348xxx  group and 31% in
the heparin-treated group (p = 0.002). at

t.d. gladwell

4 to 6 days, timi grade 3 flow was pres-

ent in 96% of patients in the low-dose
 xxxd348xxx 
group, compared with 8 1%
of the high-dose group and 83% of the
heparin-treated
group; these differences
were not statistically significant. in terms
of clinical outcomes, recurrent ischemia
or mi occurred in 7% of the low-dose  xxxd348xxx  group and 18% of the high-dose
group, compared with 23% of the heparintreated group. the differences were not
significant compared with either  xxxd348xxx  group. there was also no significant
difference
in the incidence
of serious
bleeding, which occurred in 22%, 18%,
and 3 1% of patients treated with low-dose
 xxxd348xxx , high-dose  xxxd348xxx , and heparin, respectively. these results suggest
that a combination of low-dose  xxxd348xxx 
and streptokinase
might produce higher
patency rates than a combination of streptokinase and either high-dose  xxxd348xxx 
or heparin. the finding that the higher
dose of  xxxd348xxx  was associated with a
lower incidence of vessel patency was surprising. although the investigators
attempted to speculate
on the possible
mechanisms for this outcome, including
the possibility
that higher doses of  xxxd348xxx  might inhibit the activation of
protein c (a natural anticoagulant), it may
simply have been the effect of chance and
the small sample size.“’
the hirulog early reperfusionkkclusion
(hero) trials8 compared the safety and
efficacy of 2 doses of  xxxd348xxx 
with
those of heparin in combination
with
streptokinase in patients presenting with
acute st-segment elevation mi. four hundred twelve patients were randomized in
double-blind,
double-dummy
fashion to
receive either low-dose  xxxd348xxx  (0.125
mg/kg bolus, followed by infusions of 0.25
mg/kg per hour for 12 hours and 0.125

mg/kg per hour for up to 60 hours), highdose  xxxd348xxx  (0.25mg/kg
bolus, followed by infusions of 0.5 mgkg per hour
for 12 hours and 0.25 mg/kg per hour for
up to 60 hours), or heparin (5000-u bolus, followed by an infusion of 1000-1200
u/h). all patients received aspirin 325
mg/d and streptokinase 1.5 million u over
30 to 60 minutes. coronary angiography
was performed 90 to 120 minutes after
the start of the streptokinase infusion and
36 to 60 hours later.
the primary end point (tim1 grade 3
flow in the infarct-related
artery during
the initial angiography) occurred in 35%
of heparin-treated patients, compared with
46% of the low-dose  xxxd348xxx 
group
and 48% of the high-dose  xxxd348xxx 
group (p = 0.03, high-dose  xxxd348xxx  vs
heparin; p = 0.024, all  xxxd348xxx  patients
vs heparin). there were no significant differences in rates of combined tim1 grades
2 and 3 flow in the 3 groups (69% heparin,
76% low-dose  xxxd348xxx , 68% high-dose
 xxxd348xxx ). there were also no significant differences in the combined incidence
of death or recurrent mi at 35 days in the
3 groups. major bleeding occurred significantly less frequently in the low-dose  xxxd348xxx  group compared with the heparin group (14% vs 27%; p < 0.01) but
not compared
with the high-dose
 xxxd348xxx  group (1 9%).38
the results of these 2 trials suggest that
the use of  xxxd348xxx  may improve early
patency rates compared with heparin when
given in combination
with streptokinase
for acute mi. however, the benefits of
early patency rates as a surrogate outcome
for morbidity and mortality are still uncertain. the data from several large trials’9,40 comparing different thrombolytic
regimens head to head have suggested that
improvements in early angiographic tind-

51

clinical therapeutics@

ings do not necessarily translate into reductions in death or recurrent mi. therefore, an adequately powered study of these
clinical outcomes is needed to determine
whether  xxxd348xxx  offers any additional
benefit over heparin when used in combination with a thrombolytic agent.
as a follow-up to the hero study,ss
the hero-2 tria141 was designed to address the foregoing issues specifically. the
results of hero-2 were recently presented at the 23rd congress of the european society of cardiology.42 this study
randomly assigned 17,073 patients with
evidence of an st-segment elevation mi
who presented within 6 hours of the onset
of symptoms to receive either high-dose
 xxxd348xxx  (same dose used in the hero
study) or heparin in addition to standard
therapy with aspirin and streptokinase.
patients with contraindications
to thrombolytic agents were excluded. baseline
characteristics of the enrolled patients were
similar, except for a significantly higher
percentage of women assigned to the  xxxd348xxx  group compared with the heparin
group (29.4% vs 27.3%; p = 0.003).
the primary end point of the trial, mortality at 30 days, occurred in 10.8% of patients in the  xxxd348xxx -treated
group and
10.9% of patients in the heparin-treated
group. after adjustment for baseline risk
score and sex, the primary end point remained essentially unchanged (10.5%  xxxd348xxx ,
10.9% heparin). bivalirudintreated patients had a lower incidence of
investigator-reported
reinfarction
at 30
days compared with heparin-treated
patients (3.5% vs 4.5%; p < 0.001). there
was no significant difference in the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (0.55%  xxxd348xxx , 0.37% heparin) or nonfatal disabling stroke (0.20%  xxxd348xxx , 0.30%
heparin). the incidence of severe bleed-

52

ing was higher with  xxxd348xxx 
(or =
1.12), reflecting a higher median aptt in
 xxxd348xxx -treated
patients compared with
heparin-treated patients (108 vs 77 seconds;
p < 0.001).41 these results suggest that
 xxxd348xxx  reduces the risk of reinfarction
compared with heparin when added to aspirin and streptokinase in the treatment of
acute mi, but at the cost of increased
bleeding. the cost-effectiveness
of this
regimen, as well as the use of  xxxd348xxx 
in combination with newer thrombolytic
agents, remains to be examined.

heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia
heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia
(hit)
is a serious condition that has been reported to occur at an incidence of 2% to
7%.4” the immunologic form of this disorder, hit type ii, is often associated with
substantial morbidity from life-threatening
thrombotic complications. lo antibodies are
directed against a heparin-platelet factor-4
complex and are able to cross-link platelets
by binding to specific receptors on the activated platelet surface, causing platelet
destruction
and increasing
the risk of
bleeding.4’ at the same time, the surface
of activated platelets serves as a substrate
for the formation of procoagulant
complexes such as tenase, which paradoxically
can increase the development of occlusive
thrombi.4’ continued use of heparin in
these circumstances is contraindicated.
theoretically,
 xxxd348xxx  should be a
useful anticoagulant
in the treatment of
hit. it binds selectively to free and clotbound thrombin, and does not interact
with platelets or  xxxg1726xxx . at this
time, however, data on the use of  xxxd348xxx  in patients with hit are extremely limited. a total of 39 patients with

t.d. gladwell

hit have reportedly been treated with  xxxd348xxx .43 of these, 17 presented with
acute hit, and 22 had a history of hit. in
these patients,  xxxd348xxx  was most commonly used as an anticoagulant
during
pc1 (44%) with fewer patients receiving
 xxxd348xxx  for thrombosis (13%), coronary artery bypass grafting (lo%), and
pulmonary embolism and/or deep venous
thrombosis (10%). overall, 4 of 39 (10%)
patients died, all due to complications of
hit thrombosis.
revascularization
was
successful in 94% of those undergoing
pci. although the findings suggest that
 xxxd348xxx  may be useful in patients with
hit who require anticoagulation,
further
studies are needed to more completely define the role of  xxxd348xxx  in this disorder, particularly in comparison with other
direct thrombin inhibitors (eg,  xxxd218xxx ,
 xxxd2455xxx ).

adverse

effects

the major side effect of  xxxd348xxx 
is
bleeding, as would be expected from its
mechanism of action. in clinical trials, patients treated with  xxxd348xxx  during pc1
appeared to have a reduced risk of bleeding complications compared with patients
treated with heparin. in the has tria1,44
 xxxd348xxx  was associated with a 65% reduction in the incidence of clinically significant hemorrhage, a 57% reduction in
the need for transfusions,
a 53% reduction in intravascular puncture-site hemorrhage, and a 20% reduction in the risk of
hematuria (p < 0.001, all comparisons). a
recent meta-analysis?
of 6 published trials in patients with ischemic heart disease
appeared to confirm these results, reporting a significant 59% reduction in the risk
of in-hospital hemorrhagic events with  xxxd348xxx  (p < 0.001). the absolute risk

reduction was 5.8%, or 58 fewer bleeding
events per 1000 patients treated. the recently reported results of hero-242 seem
to contradict these findings, however. the
increased risk of bleeding events seen in
hero-2 suggests that bleeding risk is
proportional to the aptt and that earlier
findings of a lower bleeding risk may have
reflected differences in levels of anticoagulation between comparator groups.
other adverse effects that were reported
in >lo% of patients in clinical trials include back pain (42%), other pain (15%),
nausea (15%) headache (12%), and hypotension (12%), although the incidences
of these effects were not significantly different from those with heparin2” there
are no published studies on drug interactions with  xxxd348xxx . pharmacodynamic
interactions might be expected with concomitant use of any drug that increases
the risk of bleeding (eg, heparin, lowmolecular-weight
heparin, aspirin, warfarin).  xxxd348xxx  is not metabolized by
the cytochrome p450 enzyme system and
would be unlikely to interact with drugs
metabolized through this pathway.23 however, caution is warranted until there is
more experience with combined use of
any of these drugs.

dosage

and administration

 xxxd348xxx  is indicated for use as an anticoagulant
in patients
with unstable
angina who are undergoing percutaneous
transluminal
coronary angioplasty.
the
recommended
intravenous
regimen is a
bolus of 1.o mg/kg followed by a 4-hour
infusion of 2.5 mg/kg per hour at the time
of angioplasty. an additional infusion of
0.2 mg/kg per hour may be continued for
up to 20 hours, if needed. the infusion
rate should be reduced in patients with

moderate to severe renal dysfunction
(table).23 although the following is not
included in the fda-approved
labeling
for  xxxd348xxx , results of clinical studies25
suggest that a lower dose (0.75mg/kg
bolus followed by a 1.75-mg/kg per hour
infusion during pci) may be considered
in patients receiving concomitant therapy
with a gp iib/iiia inhibitor. monitoring
of aptt and act is not generally necessary, although it should be considered in
patients with renal dysfunction requiring
dose adjustment.23
 xxxd348xxx  is supplied as a single-use
2.50-mg vial that must be reconstituted
with 5 ml of sterile water for injection
before use. each reconstituted vial should
be further diluted in 50 ml 5% dextrose
in water for injection or in 0.9% sodium
chloride for injection to yield a final concentration of 5 mg/ml.23 this solution
may be used for both the initial bolus and
the 4-hour infusion. for additional infusions of 0.2 mgkg per hour, reconstituted
solutions should be diluted to 0.5 mg/ml
in 500 ml 5% dextrose in water or 0.9%
 xxxd3213xxx  for injection. injections
of  xxxd348xxx 
should be administered
through a separate iv line whenever pos-

pharmacoeconomic
considerations
the average wholesale price for 1 singleuse 250-mg vial of  xxxd348xxx  is $41 8.75.9
at a dosing regimen of a 1.o-mgkg bolus
followed by a 4-hour infusion of 2.5
mg/kg per hour, a patient weighing between 70 and 90 kg would require 4 vials,
at a cost of $1675. for patients receiving
the infusion of 0.2 mg/kg per hour, an additional 2 vials are required at an added
cost of $837.50. in comparison, the cost
of 24 hours of ufh (30,000 u) is -$3.50.9
however, this analysis fails to take into
consideration
the potential cost savings
that may be associated with a lower bleeding risk and reduced need for monitoring
with  xxxd348xxx .

t.d. gladwell

one published study45 has examined
the costs involved in replacing heparin
with  xxxd348xxx 
in patients undergoing
pci. the author constructed a model using estimates of clinical-event costs from
several trials in pci. these estimates were
then used to determine
the costs associated with complications
of pci, including
repeat revascularization,
mi,
and bleeding requiring transfusion. these
costs were then applied to the clinical
outcomes of the has study in an effort
to determine the cost reduction in complications
per patient treated with  xxxd348xxx . the author reported that the
use of  xxxd348xxx 
instead of heparin
was associated with potential cost savings
(in terms of avoidance of post-pc1 complications)
of $591 to $843. it should
be noted, however, that this was not
a cost-effectiveness
analysis
and the
cost savings reported applied only to
the avoidance
of complications.

conclusions
as a direct thrombin inhibitor,  xxxd348xxx 
theoretically has advantages over ufh in
the treatment of acs because of its more
predictable dose response and its ability
to inhibit both circulating and clot-bound
thrombin. in clinical trials to date,  xxxd348xxx  appeared to have equivalent efficacy to high-dose ufh with a lower
bleeding risk during pci. results of the
hero-24’ study suggest that use of  xxxd348xxx  in combination
with streptoki-

nase and aspirin in patients with acute mi
is associated with a lower risk of reinfarction compared with heparin, but with
an increased risk of bleeding. data on the
use of  xxxd348xxx 
for other indications
(eg, unstable angina, hit), as well as in
combination with gp iib/iiia inhibitors or
newer thrombolytic
agents, are limited.
although the reason remains unclear, the
differences
in bleeding rates with  xxxd348xxx  compared with heparin probably
reflect differences in degrees of anticoagulation between comparator groups in the
clinical trials. given the high cost of  xxxd348xxx , it seems appropriate to reserve
it for use as an alternative to ufh, primarily in patients with hit, until clinical
trials have clarified its efficacy and safety.
