abstract
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (escc) is one of the most common tumors in human. previous studies showed
that multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations involved in carcinogenesis of esophagus, whereas the molecular
mechanisms are poorly understood. so far, more and more escc-related genes have been found and  xxxd3417xxx 
receptor b2 (rarb2) is such a gene which was recognized as a putative tumor suppressor gene since reduced rarb2
mrna expression has been observed in several solid tumors, including escc. a growing evidence indicated that
rarb2 was required for the growth inhibitory effect of  xxxd3417xxx  (ra). however, the molecular mechanism of its
inactivation remained obscure in escc. the rarb2 methylation status was assessed by methylation-specific pcr
(msp) in 12 escc cell lines and compared with their mrna and protein expression level. bisulfite sequencing of
rarb2 promoter region was performed to confirm the msp results. after 5-aza-2 0 - xxxd1836xxx  ( xxxd1823xxx ) treatment
the expression of rarb2 was reversed in two rarb2-downregulated cell lines. therefore, hypermethylation of the
promoter regions of rarb2 gene is a major mechanism of transcriptional inactivation and might be involved in tumor
development of esophagus in some escc cell lines suggesting that multiple mechanisms contribute to the loss of
rarb2 expression in escc cell lines. furthermore, the methylation status of rarb2 promoter region and its expression
was analyzed in 51 escc tissue samples with their adjacent normal epithelia and two normal esophageal epithelia. the
results showed that there was a statistically significant correlation between methylation status of rarb2 and tumor
grade; moreover, a relationship between methylation status and decreased rarb2 expression was found only in g2

1. introduction
esophageal cancer (ec) is one of the most
common cancers in human, which exists in two
main histopathological types-squamous cell carcinoma (scc) and adenocarcinoma (adc) [1]. the
overall 5-year survival rates of esophageal cancer
patients is still under 10% because its symptomless
progression in the early stage and poor prognosis
[2,3]. china is one of the high-risk regions of ec and
most cases belong to scc. every year more than
300,000 new cases are diagnosed and the reasons for
this increase are not well understood. therefore, early
identification and new approaches for prevention and
treatment of ec are required.
the understanding of the molecular mechanism of
the complex multi-step process of esophageal tumorigenesis will improve the development of better
treatment modalities and better diagnostic and
preventive approaches. so far, great progress has
been made in the studies of molecular mechanism of
ec. within the high-risk regions of ec, such as
shanxi province in china, studies have shown a strong
tendency toward familiar aggregation, suggesting that
genetic susceptibility, combined with potential
environmental exposures, may be involved in the
etiology of ec [4–6]. our previous studies showed
that a mendelian autosomal recessive major gene
underlying susceptibility to ec may play an important
role in the etiology of ec in a moderate highincidence area of northern china [7]. to better
understand the role of genetics in the etiology of
escc and to identify the potential susceptibility
genes, li [8] et al. found that chromosome 13 may
harbor a tumor susceptibility gene in the population.
many genes with altered expression were identified by
analyzing the gene expression profiles of escc in our
lab as well as others’, in which rarb2 is one of the
underexpressed genes.
retinoids, a group of natural and synthetic
 xxxd3105xxx  analogs, exert fundamental effects on

the modulation of cell growth, differentiation and
apoptosis. in many animal models, including those
cancers of skin, prostate and esophagus, retinoids can
suppress or reverse epithelial carcinogenesis [9].
retinoids are known to exert their biological effects
by binding to specific nuclear retinoid receptors,
which belong to a steroid/thyroid hormone-receptor
superfamily. the nuclear retinoid receptors include
rars ( xxxd3417xxx  receptors) and rxrs (retinoid x
receptors) receptors, both composed of three subtypes
(a, b and g), of which  xxxg1932xxx  is expressed as three
isoforms: b1, b2 and b4 [10]. most human cells
express rarb2 as the major isoform. it has been
reported that altered expression or function of the
retinoid receptors is associated with malignant
transformation of human cells [11,12].
rarb2 was downregulated in many types of
tumors including lung cancer, breast cancer and
esophageal cancer [13,14]. it has been demonstrated
that loss of  xxxg1932xxx  expression was an early event
associated with esophageal carcinogenesis and the
status of squamous differentiation [13], however the
mechanisms inactivating rarb2 remains to be
determined in cancer especially the esophageal
cancer. in breast cancer no mutation or polymorphisms were detected within the brare ( xxxd3417xxx 
response element) promoter, which was located in the
promoter regions of target genes, and rarb2 loss of
expression was not correlated with loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 3p24 in esophageal cancer
[15,16]. the rarb2 promoter, which is located in the
5 0 -untranslated region, is characterized by a cpg
island, and increasing data showed that aberrant
methylation of the cpg islands in tumors was
associated with transcriptional repression of tumor
suppressor genes, such as p16 in esophageal cancer
[17]. to elucidate the epigenetic mechanism of
rarb2 loss or reduction in escc, we analyzed the
methylation status of the rarb2 promoter region by
msp and bisulfite sequencing. our results indicated
that downregulation of rarb2 expression was

z. liu et al. / cancer letters 230 (2005) 271–283

associated with the aberrant methylation of the cpg
islands in some escc cell lines, but not in others; and
there was a statistically significant correlation
between methylation status of rarb2 and tumor
grade; moreover, a relationship between methylation
status and decreased rarb2 expression was found
only in g2 stage tumors. after  xxxd1823xxx  treatment,
rarb2 restoration was accompanied by growth
inhibition and this might be one of the mechanisms
but not the only mechanism for the tumor cell growth
inhibition by  xxxd1823xxx .

patients in china and were frozen in liquid nitrogen
before use.
2.3. dna preparation
genomic dna from human esophageal tissues
was extracted by proteinase-k digestion and phenol/
chloroform extraction as described previously [23].
the esophageal cell cultures were digested with
trypsin-edta before collection, and cell line dna
was then prepared using the proteinase-k method.
dna was dissolved in te buffer and stored at
k20 8c.

2. material and methods
2.4. rna isolation and semi-quantitative rt-pcr
2.1. escc cell cultures and treatments
twelve cell lines were included in this study:
yes2, kyse30, kyse70, kyse140, kyse150,
kyse180, kyse410, kyse450, kyse510,
colo680n, te12 and ec9706 which were previously established from primary human esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma [18–22]. each of the cell
lines was grown in either 90% rpmi 1640 medium
(invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) or 45% 1640/45% ham’s
f-12 medium (invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine
serum at 37 8c with 5% co2. in the demethylation
experiment, the cells with lower rarb2 expression
were treated with  xxxd1823xxx  at a final concentration of 5
or 10 mm for 96 h, growth medium with or without the
drug was changed every 24 h.
2.2. human esophageal tissue samples
the primary tumor samples and their corresponding non-cancerous tissues were obtained from 51
chinese patients in the linzhou city (people’s
hospital in linzhou city, shanxi province, china)
and the first affiliate hospital of anhui medical
university (anhui province, china) who underwent
surgery for escc. the samples were frozen in liquid
nitrogen within 1 h after surgical resection and stored
in liquid nitrogen or k80 8c until use. the study was
approved by the institutional review board of cancer
institute of chinese academy of medical sciences.
the details of the samples were described in table 1.
two cases of normal esophageal mucosa were
collected from endoscopic biopsies from tumor-free

total rnas were isolated from escc cell lines and
tissues with trizol reagent (invitrogen) according to
the manufactures’ instructions. agarose gel electrophoresis at 1% and spectrophotometric analysis
(a260:280 nm ratio) were used to assess rna quality.
ten microgram total rna of each sample was treated
with 2 ml dnase i (10 units/ml, promega, madison,
wi), 1 ml rnasin (40 units/ml, promega) at 37 8c for
15 min to remove contaminated dna. first strand
cdna was synthesized by using oligo-(dt)12–18
primer included with the superscript ii-reverse
transcriptase kit (invitrogen). five microgram of
total rna were used for each reaction and 0.5–1 ml
aliquots of the cdna then subjected to rt-pcr. the
primers used for the amplification of rarb2 were as
follows: sense 5 0 -atcgatgccaatactgtc  xxxd2196xxx  0 ; antisense 5 0 -gactcgatggtcagcac tg-3 0
[24]. as an internal control,  xxxg861xxx  was amplified to
ensure cdna quality and quantity for each rt-pcr.
a product with 241 bp was generated and pcr
products were analyzed on 2% agarose gels. the
pcr was repeated at least twice.
rarb2 expression being evidently upregulated in
the escc sample (n, corresponding normal tissue, c,
cancer; n/c%1/2) were designated as up, rarb2
expression being evidently downregulated in the
escc sample (n/cr2) were designated as down;
rarb2 expression having no change between the
noncancerous and cancerous esophageal samples
were designated as nc; nt to indicate that there
was no transcripts in tissue samples; nd to indicate
rarb2 expression level was not determined.

2.5. methylation-specific pcr
bisulfite modification of genomic dna from
primary esophageal tissues and cell lines was carried
out essentially as described previously [25]. in brief,
2 mg of genomic dna was denatured by adding
freshly prepared naoh (final concentration 0.3 m)
for 15 min in a 37 8c water bath, 30 ml of freshly
prepared 10 mm hydroquinone (sigma) and 520 ml of
freshly prepared 3.6 m sodium bisulfite (sigma) at ph
5 were added and mixed. the samples were then
incubated under  xxxd2648xxx  for 16 h at 50 8c. the
modified dna was purified with a wizard dna
clean-up system (promega). after purification, the
samples were treated with naoh at a final concentration of 0.3 m for 15 min at 37 8c. the dna was
 xxxd102xxx precipitated and re-suspended in water for
msp analysis.
the nested msp was used to detect the bisulfiteinduced changes affecting unmethylated (u) and
methylated (m) alleles. the primers for the first
round pcr were as follows: sense 5 0 aagtga
gttgtttagaggtaggaggg3 0 and antisense 5 0
cctataattaatccaaataat-catttacc3 0
[26]. amplification was performed under the following modified conditions: 95 8c, 5 min; 35 amplification cycles (95 8c, 15 s; 53 8c, 15 s; 72 8c, 30 s) and
72 8c 5 min for the first round of pcr. the pcr

products were diluted (1:10 dilution) and used in the
second round of pcr, with the primers: forward 5 0
ttgagaatgtgagtgatttga3 0 and reverse 5 0
aaccaatccaaccaaaacaa3 0 for the unmethylated sequence; forward 5 0 tcgagaacgcgagc
gattcg3 0 and reverse 5 0 gaccaatccaaccgaa acga3 0 for the methylated sequences [27].
the amplification was finished in the following
conditions: 95 8c, 5 min; 35 amplification cycles
(95 8c, 15 s; 52 8c, 15 s; 72 8c, 15 s for u-primers);
95 8c, 5 min; 20 amplification cycles (95 8c, 15 s;
62 8c, 15 s; 72 8c, 15 s for m-primers). dna from
normal lymphocytes was used as negative control for
methylated alleles and placental dna treated in vitro
with sssi methyltransferase (new england biolabs,
beverly, ma) was used as positive control for
methylated genes. the 146-bp pcr products were
analyzed using 2.5% agarose gels and photographed.
controls without dna were performed in each set of
pcr and each msp was repeated at least twice.
samples with only the unmethylation-specific band
were designated as u, samples with the methylationspecific and unmethylation-specific bands only existing in the cancerous esophageal samples were
designated as u/m; samples with the methylationspecific and unmethylation-specific bands existing in
both the noncancerous and cancerous esophageal
samples were designated as u/m(nc), samples with

276

z. liu et al. / cancer letters 230 (2005) 271–283

the methylation-specific and unmethylation-specific
bands only existing in the noncancerous esophageal
samples were designated as u/m(n).
2.6. bisulfite sequencing
the pcr products amplified with primers specific
either for the methylated or the unmethylated dna were
purified and cloned into the pmd-t vector (takara,
dalian, china) according to the manufacture’s protocol.
recombinants were transformed into escherichia coli.
plasmid dna was isolated and integrated pcr
fragments were confirmed with enzyme digestion and
pcr. the cloned pcr fragments were further sequenced
by automated sequencing (bioasia, shanghai, china).
2.7. western blot
total cell lysates were prepared by lysing cells
with the buffer [1% sds, 10 mm tris-cl, ph 7.6,
20 mg/ml aprotenin, 20 mg/ml leupeptin and 1 mm
pmsf]. the protein concentrations were determined
using bradford method (bio-rad, hercules, ca).
about 50 mg of protein were separated on 10% of
sds-page gels and transferred to pvdf membranes. after blocked with 10% non-fat milk, the
membranes were incubated with anti-rarb2 polyclonal antibody (santa cruz bitechnology inc, santa
cruz, ca) (1:1000 dilution) at 4 8c overnight. after
six 3-min washes the membranes were incubated with
goat anti-rabbit igg (1:3000 dilution) for 1 h at room
temperature. the signals were developed with the
ecl kit (amersham pharmacia biotechnology inc,
milpitas, ca), and using anti-a-tubulin antibody
(santa cruz) as an internal control.

2.9. atp bioluminescence tumor chemosensitivity
assay (atp-tca)
the cells were plated on 96-well plates at a density
of 1000–1500 cells/well. each experiment was
composed of five replicate wells at each treatment
dose. after 96-h treatment, cell growth was assessed
using the atp-tca. the absorbance (od) at 560 nm
was measured using microplate luminometer (berthold detection system, german). the inhibitory rate
was calculated using the formula: inhibitory ratez
{[(control od-medium od)-(sample od- medium
od)]/(control od-medium od)}!100%.
2.10. classification and statistical analysis
for methylation status classification, we considered samples with u/m and u/m(nc) as methylation positive, and those with u and u/m(n) as
methylation negative. the correlations among the
rarb2 methylation, its expression and clinicopathological characters or parameters were analyzed using
spearman’s correlation analysis. chi-square test was
performed to determine the differences between
distant normal epithelium and tumor tissue in
rarb2 expression and methylation. data from atptca were presented as meansgsd. differences
between groups were analyzed by 1-way anova
test. differences were considered statistically significant for p!0.05.

3.1. expression of rarb2 in escc cell lines
and tissue samples

2.8. clonogenecity
five-hundred to 1000 cells/well were seeded in
six-well plates. the next day,  xxxd1823xxx  were added at
the indicated concentration for a 96-h exposure. the
medium were replaced with drug-free medium after
the treatment. when the colonies (o50 cells) became
visible (2–4 weeks), cells were fixed with methanol,
stained with gimesa and counted. the survival
fraction was determined by dividing the number of
colonies for the drug-treated samples by the number
of colonies in non-treated control samples.

using western blotting and rt-pcr, the
expression of the rarb2 protein and mrna was
studied in twelve escc cell lines and 51 escc tissue
samples with their adjacent normal epithelia. the
expression patterns of rarb2 were similar between
the levels of protein and mrna in all of the cell lines.
fig. 1 shows representative examples of western blot

was present in nine cell lines except for kyse30,
te12 and ec9706, among which kyse150,
kyse410, kyse510 and colo680n showed

decreased expression of rarb2 protein as shown in
fig. 1a. by use of rt-pcr, we found that cell line
kyse30, which showed absence of rarb2 protein,
also lacked detectable levels of rarb2 mrna,
whereas the cell lines te12 and ec9706 without
detectable rarb2 protein, showed rarb2 transcription (fig. 1b). furthermore, markedly downregulation of rarb2 expression was observed in cell lines
kyse150, kyse410, kyse510, colo680n and
ec9706.
in 51 escc tissue samples with their corresponding noncancerous tissues, the expression level of
rarb2 mrna of 41 tissue samples with their
corresponding noncancerous tissues and protein of
10 tissue samples with their corresponding noncancerous tissues was analyzed by rt-pcr and western
blotting respectively. using western blotting, the
rarb2 protein was markedly downregulated in 90%
of esophageal cancer tissues (9/10) (fig. 2a). in two
pairs tissue samples the mrna expression pattern of
rarb2 was not determined, therefore, rarb2 was
found lower-expressed in 56% of esophageal cancer
tissues (22/39) using semi-quantative rt-pcr
(fig. 2b, table 1).

the unmethylated or the methylated products varied in
different cell lines.
to verify the reliability of the nested msp method,
pcr products amplified with primers specific either
for the methylated (cell lines kyse70 and kyse410)
or the unmethylated (cell line kyse180) dna were
cloned and sequenced. bisulfite sequencing of four
individual clones of pcr products from kyse180
showed no methylation of cpgs within the promoter
region, whereas the methylated products revealed
dense methylation within their respective cpg islands
in cell lines kyse70 and kyse410 (fig. 3b).
hypermethylation of rarb2 promoter regions was
not limited to cultured esophageal squamous cell
cancers. the methylation status of the rarb2
promoter regions was also investigated by msp in
escc samples together with their adjacent normal
epithelia (fig. 4). similarly, high frequency of
methylation of this loci was also observed among
primary esophageal tumors. both methylated and
unmethylated alleles were found in all of the primary
esophageal tumors with rarb2 methylation. we did
not, however, detect its methylation in two normal
esophageal tissue samples taken from healthy
patients. methylation of rarb2 promoter regions
was detected in 26/51 (51%) of the primary tumors;
moreover in seven tissue samples with their adjacent
normal epithelia, methylation of this locus was found
in both the adjacent normal epithelia and their
matched tumor tissues; and in other 19 tissue samples
with their adjacent normal epithelia methylation of
this locus only existed in the primary esophageal
tumors; and in two cases, hypermethylation was
observed in the adjacent normal epithelia, but not in

3.2. methylation analysis of the rarb2 promoter

hypermethylated rarb2-related alleles among the
esophageal cancer cell lines (fig. 3a). both methylated and unmethylated alleles were detected in ten cell
lines except for kyse180 and te12 in which only the
unmethylated alleles were found. the quantitation of

only in two cell lines kyse150 and kyse410
(fig. 5b and c). the other four cell lines showed
no detectable re-expression of rarb2 mrna after
 xxxd1823xxx  treatment (data not shown). these data
indicated that rarb2 promoter methylation leads to
the downregulation of rarb2 expression in some
escc cell lines.
reduction of rarb2 rna and protein expression
was observed in six of 10 cell lines that have partially
methylated alleles, however the other four cell lines
showed strong rarb2 gene expression which
suggested that aberrant methylation might play other
roles except for leading to gene silencing.

data revealed that rarb2 methylation is a common
neoplastic feature of escc.
3.3.  xxxd1823xxx  induces demethylation of the rarb2
promoter, reactivates rarb2 gene expression in
escc cell lines
to determine whether rarb2 promoter methylation could be further linked to the downregulation
of its expression, escc cell lines which showed
evidently decreased expression of rarb2 and cell
line kyse180 without methylated alleles were
treated with the demethylating agent ( xxxd1823xxx ).
to assess the effects of demethylating agent, we
analyzed the methylation status in kyse410 cells
after  xxxd1823xxx  treatment and partial demethylation
was detected by msp as shown in fig. 5a.
meanwhile, the msp product was still observed
after treatment since  xxxd1823xxx  only inhibits methylation of newly synthesized dna. in addition, the
level of rarb2 mrna showed no change in cell
line kyse180 before and after demethylating
treament. among the six cell lines where rarb2
genes carried methylated alleles, the treatment led to
restoration of rarb2 mrna and protein expression

3.4. correlation between rarb2 promoter
methylation and downregulation of its
expression in esophageal carcinogenesis
the downregulation of rarb2 expression and
rarb2 methylation in esophageal cancer samples
compared with that in distant normal epithelia
samples was statistically significant (pz0.000 and
pz0.001, respectively). to elucidate the relationship
between dna hypermethylation and downregulation
or loss of expression of rarb2, we further analyze
the relationship in well-differentiated, moderately
differentiated and poorly differentiated sccs,
respectively. and a significant correlation between
hypermethylation and downregulation of expression
of rarb2 was only observed in g2 stage tumors
(pz0.027) (table 2).
3.5. methylation and clinicopathological correlations
the results of statistical analysis for correlation of
promoter methylation status of rarb2 gene in the
tumor tissues with clinicopathological data showed
that there were no significant correlation of promoter

on. however, a significant correlation between
promoter hypermethylation and histological differentiation was observed (pz0.016). the methylation
was detected in 67% of well-differentiated sccs and
in 57% of moderately differentiated sccs, but only in
17% of poorly differentiated sccs (fig. 6).
3.6. cell growth inhibition
to evaluate the anti-neoplastic effect of  xxxd1823xxx ,
the effect of this agent on cell growth was determined
by colony assay and atp-tca in both cell lines
kyse150 and kyse410 after a 96-hr  xxxd1823xxx 
exposure. a significant difference was observed
between cells with and without drug treatment in
cell lines kyse150 (pz0.000 and pz0.000 respectively) and kyse410 (pz0.000 and pz0.000,
respectively) (fig. 7a and b).

4. discussion
rarb2 has been recognized as a putative tumor
suppressor gene. a growing evidence has revealed

279

that the anticancer effect of ra is primarily mediated
by rarb2. another study indicated that not only
expression but also up-regulation of  xxxg1932xxx  was linked
to retinoid sensitivity in esophageal cancer cell lines
[28], and previous study in our lab also suggested that
ra resistance in ec109 cells paralleled with the loss
of rarb2 inducibility [29]. unfortunately, rarb2
expression is frequently lost in esophageal carcinogenesis [13]. recent study suggested that hypermethylation of  xxxg1932xxx  may play an important role in
the early stage of esophageal squamous cell carcinogenesis [30]. however, the mechanisms of rarb2
suppression are not well known in esophageal cancer.
the potential causes for progressive decrease in
rarb2 mrna expression may be both genetic and
epigenetic during esophageal carcinogenesis. it has
been reported that there is no correlation between loss
of  xxxg1932xxx  expression and loh on chromosome 3p24
in escc [16]. moreover, no mutations or other
genetic alterations were detected in different cell lines
that did not express  xxxg1932xxx  mrna [31,32]. these
results suggest that it is unlikely that changes in gene
structure are the reason for the lost  xxxg1932xxx  expression
in those cancers and other mechanisms for rarb2
suppression should be considered. in this study, we
hypothesize that hypermethylation of rarb2 promoter regions is a major mechanism for the silencing of
this gene. in addition, arapshian [33] et al. concluded
that methylation of the rare region may be
particularly important in rarb2 suppression. the
rarb2 was not hypermethylated in two healthy
esophageal tissue from the non escc patients.

methylation of rarb2 promoter regions was detected
in 26/51 (51%) of the primary tumors; and in 7 (27%)
tissue samples, methylation of this locus was found
not only in tumor tissues but also in the corresponding
noncancerous tissues; these results were similar to
those reported by kuroki [30] suggesting rarb2
hypermethylation may play an important role in the
early steps of tumor progression of escc. both
methylated and unmethylated alleles were found in all
of the primary esophageal tumors with rarb2
methylation. this finding likely represents the presence of normal, non-neoplastic esophageal epithelium in the human escc tumor tissues, which
accounts for the unmethylated alleles in many cases.
in two cases, hypermethylation was observed in the
adjacent normal epithelia, but not in the corresponding escc samples. one possibility is the group of
cells with hypermethylation in normal tissues did not
develop to cancer without other key molecular
alterations and the clinically detected carcinomas
originated from different clones of epithelial cells.
we used rt-pcr and western blot to analyze the
expression of rarb2 in escc tissue samples.
compared with their corresponding normal tissues,
frequency of downregulation of rarb2 expression is
61.1, 60.0 and 72.7% in well-differentiated, moderatedifferentiated and poorly-differentiated escc
samples.
in fisher’s exact test there was a significant
correlation between downregulation of rarb2

expression and dna hypermethylation in moderatedifferentiated escc samples. in og2 stage tumors,
eight of 12 tumors with the methylated alleles showed
decreased expression of rarb2 and the expression of
rarb2 was not lowered in two of six tumors with the
unmethylated alleles, which suggests that hypermethylation of rarb2 gene plays a role in the
downregulation or loss of expression of rarb2 of
some tumor samples, but not the primary role in all
the og2 stage tumors. as for the !g2 stage tumors,
the expression of rarb2 was downregulated in seven
of nine tumors with the unmethylated alleles, which

suggests that other mechanisms was involved in the
regulation of rarb2 expression. in g2 stage tumors,
of the 20 samples with clear methylated or unmethylated status, 15 showed a good concordance with the
rarb2 expression level. in five samples that did not
show a concordance, three samples that had decreased
rarb2 expression but showed no hypermethylation,
which could be attributable to other mechanisms;
moreover, two escc samples with no lowered
rarb2 expression but also with methylation bands,
is more intriguing.
the result suggests that inactivation of expression
of rarb2 gene, primarily caused by dna hypermethylation, may be involved in tumor progression of
escc. the involvement of cpg island hypermethylation in the silencing of the rarb2 gene is also
supported by the findings that partial demethylation of
the gene and upregulation of its expression occurred
in the treatment of some escc cell lines (cell lines
kyse150 and kyse410) with  xxxd1823xxx . moreover,
in te12 cell line the mrna expression was detected,
whereas the protein band was absent suggesting that
post-transcriptional mechanisms also play a role
involved in the downregulation of rarb2 expression.
previous study has demonstrated that for breast
carcinoma a relationship between methylation status
and decreased rarb2 expression was found only in
invasive grade ii tumors [26]. there was mounting
evidence that suggested epigenetic modifications
may be a mechanism responsible for the lack of
rarb2 expression in some epithelial cancers or
cancer cell lines, such as breast cancer, colon cancer
and prostate cancer [26,34,35]. in 14 tissue samples,
the tumors had decreased rarb2 expression but
showed no hypermethylation which attribute to other
mechanisms, such as gene deletion or loh [16].
and demethylation could only lead to the restoration
of rarb2 expression in 1/3 escc cell lines without
3p deletion but not in the other cell lines with 3p
deletion which indicated that there were other
mechanisms, such as deletion, involved in the loss
of rarb2 expression in escc cell lines [36]. it was
reported that differential function of coactivators and
corepressors may determine the level of  xxxg1932xxx 
induction that may mediate retinoid action in colon
cancer cells [37]. in addition, orphan receptor couptf have been identified to play a key role in
modulating  xxxg1932xxx  expression and retinoid sensitivity

281

in cancer cells [38]. in a word, multiple mechanisms
may contribute to the loss of rarb2 expression.
a significant correlation was also observed
between promoter hypermethylation and histological
differentiation which may be helpful to the distinction of tumor types and subtypes. such methylation
appears to be specific to cancer because it was not
detected in normal esophageal samples and exists in
some noncancerous esophageal samples, and thus
could serve a good marker for early cancer
detection.
unlike genetic changes, epigenetic changes could
potentially be reversed using dna mtase inhibitors
such as  xxxd1823xxx  in cancer. clinically,  xxxd1823xxx  and its
analogs have been used to treat leukemia and lung
cancer [39,40]. the clinical benefit observed has been
associated with the restoration of previously silenced
genes.
in our study, we detected the in vitro anticancer
effect of  xxxd1823xxx . in cell lines kyse150 and
kyse410, tumor cell growth was significantly
inhibited compared with the untreated groups and
rarb2 can be reactivated by  xxxd1823xxx  treatment.
previous studies have demonstrated that  xxxg1932xxx 
induction may play an important role in mediating
growth inhibitory effects of retinoids in lung cell lines
and atra-induced expression of  xxxg1932xxx  may be a
marker for retinoid sensitivity [41,42]. thus we
conclude that restoration of rarb2 expression
might be one of the mechanisms but not the only
mechanism for the tumor cell growth inhibition by
 xxxd1823xxx . yang [43] et al. have reported that anticancer activity of  xxxd1823xxx  is partly dependent on the
reactivation of rarb2 gene in breast cancer.
in conclusion, this study not only shows downregulation of rarb2 is closely associated with dna
methylation in some escc but also provides the first
evidence that hypermethylation of rarb2 promoter
regions correlates well with the histopathological
grade. these findings may have clinical implications
for cancer diagnosis, prevention and treatment. in this
study, accompanying the rarb2 restoration the
tumor cell growth was inhibited by  xxxd1823xxx  and the
chemopreventive effects of retinoids depends on
rarb2 induction, therefore combined treatment
with  xxxd1823xxx  and retinoids may produce an effective
therapeutic approach to treat escc.
