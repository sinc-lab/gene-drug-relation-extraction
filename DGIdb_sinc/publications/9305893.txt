folate) to glycine and 5,10-methylene-h4-folate (5,10-ch2-h4folate) and plays a major role in one-carbon metabolism (1).
this enzyme is a component of thymidylate cycle, along with
 xxxg2366xxx  and  xxxg631xxx  and has
been suggested as an alternate target for cancer chemotherapy
(2– 4).  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  contains covalently bound pyridoxal 59-phosphate
(plp), which forms an internal aldimine with the e-amino
group of lys-256 in the rabbit and sheep liver cytosolic  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx 
(5, 6). an early step in the catalysis is the formation of an
external aldimine, i.e. cofactor-substrate complex, which absorbs between 420 – 430 nm. this is followed by the formation
of a resonance-stabilized carbanion (quinonoid intermediate)
with an absorption maximum near 500 nm (7). the formation
of the quinonoid intermediate requires the abstraction of an
a-proton from the amino acid substrate. it has been suggested
in several plp enzymes that lysine, which forms an internal
aldimine, is the likely candidate for the abstraction of this
proton (8 –12). in contrast to these observations, it has been
suggested that in escherichia coli  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx , lys-229 (equivalent
to lys-256 of rabbit and sheep liver cytosolic shmts) is not the
base that removes the a-proton (13).  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  has been classified
by sequence alignments in the same family as aminotransferases for which crystal data are available (14 –16). however,
the mechanism of reaction catalyzed by  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  is different from
that of aspartate aminotransferase, since it involves a ca–cb
bond cleavage and removal of proton from b-hydroxyl group of
serine in the aldol cleavage reaction. in the reverse reaction,
with glycine and 5,10-ch2-h4-folate, the 2-s proton (ca-h) is
abstracted to form the quinonoid intermediate.
chemical modification studies with sheep liver cytosolic
 xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  suggested that lys, arg, his, and cys residues are
essential for catalysis (17). the alignment of  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  sequences
from several sources indicated that a few of the his residues
are conserved among prokaryotic and eukaryotic shmts (18).
as a first step in identifying the his residue(s) essential for
enzyme activity, his-147, his-150, which were conserved
among all shmts, and his-134, which was present only in
eukaryotic shmts (table i), were chosen for this study. an
inspection of the alignment of the fold type i plp-dependent
enzymes showed that his-147 of sheep liver  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  corresponds
to conserved trp-140 of aspartate aminotransferase, shown to
be involved in plp binding (19). in other members of the fold
type i group, this position is occupied by phe, tyr, or his (16).
however,  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  his-150 is not conserved in other fold type i
enzymes except aspartate aminotransferase and glutamate-1semialdehyde aminotransferase.2 this paper describes the construction, expression, and characterization of h134n, h147n,

in an attempt to unravel the role of conserved histidine residues in the structure-function of sheep liver
cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase ( xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx ),
three site-specific mutants (h134n, h147n, and h150n)
were constructed and expressed. h134n and h147n
shmts had km values for l- xxxd3193xxx allo-threonine and
b-phenylserine similar to that of wild type enzyme, although the kcat values were markedly decreased. h134n
 xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  was obtained in a dimeric form with only 6% of
bound pyridoxal 5*-phosphate (plp) compared with the
wild type enzyme. increasing concentrations of plp (up
to 500 mm) enhanced the enzyme activity without changing its oligomeric structure, indicating that his-134 may
be involved in dimer-dimer interactions. h147n  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx 
was obtained in a tetrameric form but with very little
plp (3%) bound to it, suggesting that this residue was
probably involved in cofactor binding. unlike the wild
type enzyme, the cofactor could be easily removed by
dialysis from h147n  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx , and the apoenzyme thus
formed was present predominantly in the dimeric form,
indicating that plp binding is at the dimer-dimer interface. h150n  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  was obtained in a tetrameric form
with bound plp. however, the mutant had very little
enzyme activity (<2%). the kcat/km values for l-serine,
l-allo-threonine and b-phenylserine were 80-, 56-, and
33-fold less compared with wild type enzyme. unlike the
wild type enzyme, it failed to form the characteristic
quinonoid intermediate and was unable to carry out the
exchange of 2-s proton from glycine in the presence of
h4-folate. however, it could form an external aldimine
with serine and glycine. the wild type and the mutant
enzyme had similar kd values for serine and glycine.
these results suggest that his-150 may be the base that
abstracts the a-proton of the substrate, leading to formation of the quinonoid intermediate in the reaction
catalyzed by  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx .

function of conserved his residues in  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx 

and h150n mutants. a study of the oligomeric structure and
the spectral and catalytic properties of these three mutants
suggests that his-134 has a role in subunit interactions, his147 in the cofactor binding, and his-150 in the proton abstraction step of catalysis.
experimental procedures

materials—[a-32p] xxxd1148xxx  (3000 ci/mmol), l-[3-14c]serine (55 mci/
mmol), restriction endonucleases, sequenasetm version 2.0 dna sequencing kit, and dna-modifying enzymes were obtained from amersham international. cm-sephadex and sephacryl s-200 were obtained
from pharmacia. glycine, l- xxxd5xxx alanine, nadh, b-phenylserine,
2- xxxd26xxx ,  xxxd2146xxx , plp, and edta were obtained from
sigma. l-allo-threonine was purchased from fluka. h4-folate was prepared by the method of hatefi et al. (21). all other chemicals were of
analytical reagent grade. the mutant oligonucleotides were purchased
from bangalore genei private ltd., bangalore, india. centricon filters
were obtained from amicon, inc. the altered sites ii in vitro mutagenesis system was purchased from promega corp.
bacterial strains and growth conditions—e. coli strain dh5a (life
technologies, inc.) was the recipient for all plasmids used in subcloning. the bl21(de3) plyss strain (22) was used for bacterial expression
of petsh (23) and his mutant constructs. luria-bertani medium or
terrific broth (24) with 50 mg/ml of ampicillin was used for growing e.
coli cells containing the plasmids (24).
dna manipulations—plasmids were prepared by the alkaline lysis
procedure as described by sambrook et al. (24). restriction endonuclease digestions, klenow filling, and ligations were carried out according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. the preparation of competent cells
and transformation was carried out by the method of alexander (25).

from the agarose gel, the dna fragments were eluted by the low
melting agarose gel method (24).
site-directed mutagenesis—the sheep liver cytosolic  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  cdna
clone was isolated and overexpressed in e. coli (23). this clone was used
for the preparation of site-specific mutants described in this paper.
h134n and h147n mutants were constructed using a polymerase chain
reaction-based megaprimer method as described earlier (26). these
mutants were constructed from pucsh (containing the  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  cdna
fragment lacking 227 bp at the 59-end in a puc 19 vector) as a template.
the mutant oligonucleotides, 59-g  xxxg889xxx  gag ccc aat ggc cgc a-39
and 59-g gat ggg ggc aac ctg acc c 39 were used for the
construction of the h134n and h147n mutants, respectively. the fulllength polymerase chain reaction products, obtained upon two rounds of
polymerase chain reaction were subcloned into the puc 19 vector at
kpni and bamhi sites. the clones obtained after the mutagenesis
procedure were screened by sequencing the gene at the mutated region.
the h150n mutant was generated using the altered sites ii in vitro
mutagenesis system from promega. this mutant was constructed using
a 20-mer mutagenic primer (59-c cac ctg acc aat ggg ttc a-39)
from the palsh clone ( xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  cdna clone lacking 227 bp at the 59-end
in palter-1 vector). initially, the clones were screened by ampicillin
selection and later by dna sequencing according to the mutagenesis kit
protocol. puc 19 and palter-1 plasmids containing the mutated
 xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  cdna were purified and digested using the kpni and pmaci
restriction enzymes flanking all three histidine mutations. the 520base pair kpni-pmaci mutated dna fragments were gel-purified and
swapped at the same sites of petsh vector (23). the clones obtained
were screened by sequencing. the entire 520-base pair kpni-pmaci
dna fragments were sequenced using sequenasetm version 2.0 dna
sequencing kit in all three mutants to rule out the presence of other

nonspecific mutations.
expression and purification of his-134, -147, and -150 mutant enzymes—petsh, h134n, h147n, and h150n mutant enzymes were
purified as described by jagath et al. by subjecting bl21 (de3) plys
extracts to ammonium sulfate fractionation, cm-sephadex, sephacryl
s-200 column chromatography (27). sephacryl s-200 fractions containing  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  were pooled and precipitated with 65% ammonium sulfate.
the pellet was resuspended in buffer a (50 mm potassium phosphate
buffer, ph 7.4, containing 1 mm 2- xxxd26xxx  and 1 mm edta)
and dialyzed against 1 liter of the same buffer (with two changes) for
24 h. this enzyme preparation was used in these studies.
protein estimation—one ml of purified rshmt (10 a280/ml) enzyme
was passed through a centricon filter by rinsing with 10 ml of double
distilled water. after centricon filtration, the absorbance was measured at 280 nm, and then the sample was lyophilized and weighed. the
concentration at 1 a280 was found to be 1.2 mg with a molar extinction
coefficient of 176,333 m21 cm21. a similar value was obtained when the
protein concentration was estimated by the method of gill and von
hippel (28). this value was used for the estimation of all three mutant
enzymes, since the absorbance at 280 nm did not change compared with
wild type enzyme.
enzyme assays—the  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx -catalyzed aldol cleavage of serine with
h4-folate to form glycine and 5,10-ch2-h4 folate was monitored using
14
l-[3- c]serine and h4-folate as substrates in the absence and presence
of 500 mm plp (29, 30). the  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx -catalyzed aldol cleavage of l-allothreonine to glycine and acetaldehyde was monitored at 340 nm by the
nadh-dependent reduction of acetaldehyde to ethanol and nad1 in
the presence of an excess amount of  xxxg110xxx  as described
earlier (31) with the following modifications. one ml of buffer a contained  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  (1–70 mg),  xxxg110xxx  (100 mg), nadh (250
mm), and 0 –10 mm l-allo-threonine. the reference cuvette contained all
the above components except l-allo-threonine. the reaction was monitored in the absence and presence of plp (500 mm) at 37 °c for 10 min.
the nadh consumed in the reaction was calculated using a molar
extinction coefficient of 6220 m21 cm21 (32). the rate of cleavage of
b-phenylserine to benzaldehyde was monitored at 279 nm for 5 min at
37 °c as described earlier (33). the amount of the enzyme (rshmt and
mutant enzymes) used in the reaction was in the range of 2.5–300 mg.
the concentration of benzaldehyde formed in the reaction was calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 1400 m21 cm21. the rates of
transamination of d-alanine to pyruvate and pyridoxamine 59-phosphate (pmp) were determined by measuring the rate of increase in
absorbance at 325 nm (34). the reaction was carried out in buffer a at
37 °c for 5 min. the amount of pmp formed in the reaction was
calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 8300 m21 cm21 (35).
the concentration of the enzyme (rshmt and h150n  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx ) used in
the reaction was in the range of 0.35–1.5 mg.
circular dichroism—cd measurements were made in jasco-j-500 a
automated recording spectropolarimeter. all cd spectra were recorded

at 22 6 2 °c in buffer a using the same buffer as blank. a protein
concentration corresponding to 0.12 mg/ml was used for far-uv cd
studies. visible cd spectra were recorded in a jasco-j-20 c automated
recording spectropolarimeter at a protein concentration of 1.2 mg/ml in
buffer a.
size exclusion chromatography—to analyze the oligomeric structures of the his mutant enzymes, a superose-12 hr 10/30 analytical gel
filtration column attached to pharmacia fplc system was used. the
column was calibrated with standard proteins such as  xxxg818xxx  (440
kda), sheep cytosolic  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  (213 kda), yeast  xxxg110xxx 
(150 kda), bovine  xxxg124xxx  (66 kda), carbonic anhydrase (29
kda), and  xxxg569xxx  (12.4 kda). the buffer used for this study was
buffer a containing 0.1 m kcl and 0.05% sodium azide.
dissociation constants—the dissociation constants of the enzymesubstrate complexes with rshmt and h150n  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  were determined
by a slight modification of the earlier procedure (36). the substrateinduced quenching of enzyme bound plp fluorescence was monitored
using a shimadzu rf-5000 spectrofluorimeter. the enzyme (1 mg/ml)
sample was incubated with increasing concentrations of l-serine
(0.1–50 mm) or glycine (0.5–100 mm) at 25 6 2 °c, and the fluorescence
was monitored at 450 –550 nm after excitation at 425 nm. the kd values
were obtained from double reciprocal plots of the change in fluorescence
units at 495 nm as a function of the ligand concentration. it was
ensured that inner filter quenching was minimal and did not interfere
with the measurements.
proton exchange studies—[2-3h]glycine was purified on dowex50w-12 column packed in a 1-ml syringe as described (37). the rshmt
or h150n enzyme (60 mg) in hepes buffer ph 7.4 was incubated with
30 mm [2-3h]glycine (2.2 3 105 cpm) for 10 min at 37 °c. after the
incubation, h4-folate (0 –100 mm) was added, and the reaction continued
for an additional 1 min at 37 °c. the reaction was stopped by the
addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the denatured protein was
removed by centrifugation. the supernatant was loaded onto a dowex
50w-12 column that was previously equilibrated with 10 mm hcl. the
column was washed with 5 ml of 10 mm hcl, the eluant was collected
(0.5-ml fractions), and the radioactivity was measured.
apoenzyme preparation—apoenzyme of rshmt was prepared as
described earlier (13) with minor modifications. d-alanine (200 mm) was
added to the holoenzyme in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, ph 7.4,
containing 10 mm 2- xxxd26xxx , 1 mm edta and 200 mm ammonium sulfate and incubated at 37 °c for 4 h. the pyruvate and pmp
formed during the reaction were removed by passing the sample
through a 30-kda centricon filter.

mutated to asn by site-directed mutagenesis as described under “experimental procedures.” the expression of the mutant
constructs was as good, since the wild type clone (petsh) and
the expressed proteins were present predominantly (.90%) in
the soluble fraction. the enzyme present in the soluble fraction
was purified by a procedure identical to that used for the wild
type enzyme, and yields of the enzymes were in the range of
40 –50 mg/liter. the purified mutant proteins were homogeneous as indicated by a single band on native page and sdspolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the purified rshmt (wild
type), h134n, h147n, and h150n shmts were assayed using
0.6, 15, 30, and 30 mg of the enzyme, respectively. the h150n
 xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  had the lowest specific activity of 0.06 units/mg, while
h134n and h147n shmts had 0.18 and 0.09 units/mg, respectively, compared with a value of 4.8 units/mg for rshmt.
spectral properties of h134n, h147n, and h150n shmts—
the far-uv cd spectra of all the mutant enzymes were essentially similar to the wild type enzyme, suggesting that there
were no alterations in the secondary structure upon mutation
of the specified his to asn residues. the presence of characteristic spectral intermediates in the catalytic process of  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx 
has provided a convenient handle to examine the specific functions of identified amino acid residues in the structure and
function of the enzyme. it can be seen from fig. 1a that h150n
has slightly reduced absorbance at 425 nm compared with
rshmt, while h134n and h147n shmts had much less absorbance when an equal concentration of protein (1.2 mg) was
used for recording the spectrum. h134n and h147n shmts
had very little cd in the visible region (350 –500 nm), while
h150n  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  gave a visible cd spectrum characteristic of the
presence of an internal aldimine at the active site. h134n,
h147n, and h150n shmts had approximately 6.3, 3, and 64%
of the visible cd (at 425 nm) that rshmt had, respectively
(data not shown). it can be seen from fig. 1b that the quinonoid
intermediate (495 nm) was observed when glycine and h4folate were added to h134n and h147n mutant enzymes.
however, this intermediate was not seen with h150n  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx .
even increasing the concentration of h150n  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  from 1 to 5
mg did not result in the formation of this intermediate.
oligomeric structure—the oligomeric status of the enzymes
immediately after the sephacryl-s-200 column chromatography step of purification was examined by using a calibrated
superose-12 hr 10/30 analytical gel filtration column. the
rshmt, h147n, and h150n shmts eluted as single symmetrical peak corresponding to a molecular mass of ;220 kda,
indicating that they are in the tetrameric form. however, the
h134n  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  eluted as a single peak corresponding to the
mass of the dimer (;100 kda) (fig. 2a). when the column was
equilibrated with plp (150 mm), the elution profiles were iden-

without ligand (line 1), and the visible cd spectra were recorded from

tical. dialysis of the h147n mutant enzyme against the buffer
not containing the plp resulted in the formation of apoenzyme
that was predominantly in the dimeric form; in contrast, the
rshmt remained as a tetramer with bound plp under similar
conditions (fig. 2b). removal of plp from rshmt by transamination of d-alanine followed by dialysis for 24 h resulted in the
partial dissociation of the tetramer to a dimer (fig. 2b).
catalytic properties—a unique feature of  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  is its ability
to catalyze a variety of h4-folate-dependent and -independent
reactions (7). to assess the role of the mutated his residues in
reaction specificity, some of these reactions were examined.

calculated from a double reciprocal plot (data not shown). similarly, increasing concentrations of the plp enhanced the activity of h147n  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx , and the apparent ka value of 110 mm for
plp was calculated (data not shown). the kcat values of the
h134n and h147n shmts at 500 mm plp were 1.20 and 0.75
s21, respectively, compared with 4.32 s21 for rshmt (table ii).
role of his-150 in catalysis—unlike h134n and h147n
shmts, increasing concentrations of plp did not increase the
activity of h150n  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx . it is interesting to recall that this
mutant enzyme was unable to generate the quinonoid intermediate (fig. 1b). increasing concentrations of the h4-folate from
0 – 450 mm did not result in the formation of quinonoid intermediate. however, under similar conditions, the concentration
of quinonoid intermediate increased significantly with rshmt
(fig. 3a).
earlier investigations on the mechanism of catalysis involving d-alanine as the substrate had indicated the formation of
the quinonoid intermediate (38). it can be seen from fig. 4 that
increasing concentrations of h4-folate or increase in ph values
enhanced the formation of the quinonoid intermediate with
wild type enzyme in the presence of d-alanine. in the case of
h150n  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx , there was only a marginal increase in the
quinonoid intermediate when ph was varied, but there was no
change with increasing concentrations of h4-folate.
a stereospecific proton (2-s) abstraction from the external
aldimine is an integral part of the mechanism for the formation
of the quinonoid intermediate, and the h4-folate has been
shown to enhance this proton abstraction from [2-3h]glycine
(39). this step in catalysis has been conveniently monitored by
exchange with the solvent protons and its enhancement upon
the addition of h4-folate. it can be seen from fig. 3b that there
was a large enhancement of proton exchange with wild type
enzyme upon increase in h4-folate concentration, while such an
exchange was absent in the case of h150n  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx . it was
shown earlier that higher concentrations of h4-folate inhibit
the proton exchange reaction (37).
formation of the external aldimine—the formation of the
external aldimine was monitored by recording the visible cd
spectra in the presence of ligands (l-serine and glycine) or by
monitoring the substrate induced fluorescence quenching as
described under “experimental procedures.” the kd values for
glycine obtained from the fluorescence quenching data were 10
and 13 mm for h150n  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  and rshmt, respectively. similarly, the kd values for serine were 1.54 and 1.0 mm for h150n

0.2 mm) for the mutant enzymes were similar to that of wild
type enzyme, whereas the kcat values decreased significantly
for all of the three mutant enzymes. a comparison of the
kcat/km values indicated that the h134n, h147n, and h150n
shmts are 36-, 70-, and 80-fold less efficient compared with
the wild type enzyme in the h4-folate-dependent physiological
reaction in the absence of added plp, whereas in the presence
of 500 mm plp, the activities were 6.85-, 8.64-, and 64-fold less
efficient. the km values for l-allo-threonine were similar in the
absence and presence of added plp for all of the mutant enzymes and rshmt (table ii). however, the kcat values were
markedly decreased. the kcat/km values for l-allo-threonine
with the h134n, h147n, and h150n shmts were 21-, 32-,
and 60 6 4-fold less compared with wild type enzyme in the
absence and presence of added plp. the difference in the kcat
values of the mutants (h134n, h147n) in the h4-folate-dependent and -independent reactions in the presence of excess
plp could be due to the effect of a large excess plp or errors in
the estimation of the activity due to the interference of plp
absorbance at 340 nm, the wavelength at which  xxxg110xxx  activity was estimated. the mutant enzymes catalyzed the b-phenylserine cleavage very poorly compared with
rshmt. the km values for h134n, h147n, h150n, and
rshmt were 20, 25, 25, and 40 mm, respectively. the kcat
values for h134n, h147n, h150n, and rshmt in the absence
of added plp were 0.187, 0.776, 0.218, and 11.65 s21, respectively. in the presence of 500 mm plp, the b-phenylserine
cleavage could not be monitored due to the interference of plp
in the assay.
interaction of the plp with h134n and h147n shmts—
the low activity, the decreased absorbance (fig. 1a), and visible cd at 425 nm indicated that these mutant enzymes contained only a small amount of bound plp. a possible
explanation for this could be an alteration in the affinity for the
cofactor (plp) upon mutation of these his residues. the apoenzyme of rshmt was prepared as described under “experimental procedures.” the hydroxymethyltransferase activity was
monitored at increasing concentrations of plp, and a maximal
activity was obtained at about 60 mm plp. from a replot of the
data, a ka value of 6 mm for plp was obtained. since the final
enzyme preparations of h134n and h147n shmts had very
little enzyme activity, attempts were made to enhance the
activity by increasing the concentrations of plp in the assay
mixture. the activity of the h134n  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  increased with
increasing concentrations of plp, and an apparent saturation
was reached at 250 mm. an apparent ka value of 60 mm was

substrates (serine or glycine) displaces the active site lysine
and forms an external aldimine, resulting in a decrease of the
enzyme’s visible cd spectra. it can be seen from the fig. 5 that
the addition of serine or glycine resulted in the decrease of
visible cd for rshmt. similar changes were observed in the
case of h150n  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  also, indicating the formation of an
external aldimine.
discussion

the identification of the specific amino acid residues essential for the structure and function of enzymes is greatly facilitated by the availability of their three-dimensional structure.
however, the unavailability of the crystal structure of  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx 
has hampered the identification of possible residues at the
active site. chemical modification studies had indicated that
arg, lys, cys, and his residues are essential for activity of
sheep liver cytosolic  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  (17). a comparison of the sequences
of shmts was carried out with the objective of identifying the
conserved his residues. this comparison indicated that his147, -150, -230, -255, -306, and -356 were conserved in all
shmts, and his-134 and -304 were conserved among eukaryotic shmts. as a first step in identifying the his residue(s)
involved in catalysis, his-134, -147, and -150 residues were

mutated to asn. the consequences of such mutation on the
structure and functional properties of the enzyme are discussed
below.
the role of his-134 —his-134 is conserved in all the tetrameric eukaryotic shmts, whereas this residue is replaced by
a glycine in prokaryotic shmts that exist as dimers (40, 41)
(table i), suggesting that this residue may have a role in the
maintenance of the tetrameric structure. mutation of this residue to asn indeed resulted in the alteration of the quaternary
structure of the enzyme, leading to the formation of dimers as
shown in fig. 2a with lowered enzyme activity and plp binding. h134n  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  follows the similar catalytic mechanism as
the wild type enzyme without a change in the affinity for
substrates. the results presented in this paper also show for
the first time that the dimeric eukaryotic  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  can be enzymatically active, albeit poorly, and are compatible with the
explanation that the his-134 is probably interacting with an as
yet unidentified negatively charged group on the neighboring
subunit. mutation of this his residue disrupts these interactions. the formation of the dimers rather than monomers
would suggest that the enzyme is a dimer of dimers.
the role of his-147—as shown in table i, his-147 is con-

strates, his-150 could act as proton acceptor by interacting
with the -ch2oh group. it is worthwhile mentioning that the
-ch2oh group is located stereospecifically equivalent to the
2-s proton of glycine. this type of mechanism has been visualized in the reaction of hydroxyamino acids (43, 44). thus,
mutation of the crucial his-150 residue blocks the proton abstraction step, although it does not affect the formation of an
external aldimine and leads to a marked decrease in enzyme
activity. the sequence alignment of the fold type i group of
plp-dependent enzymes shows that, unlike  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  his-147,
his-150 is not a conserved residue and is equivalent to aspartate aminotransferase his-143. it was shown that mutation of
aspartate aminotransferase his-143 did not affect the catalytic
activity, and it was suggested that this residue may play an
auxiliary role in the transaldimination reaction (45). it is pertinent to point out that the mechanism of the reactions catalyzed by aspartate aminotransferase and  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  are different
and that therefore the function of his-150 is probably unique to
 xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx . the results presented in this paper clearly demonstrate
the role of his-134 in subunit interactions, his-147 in cofactor
binding, and his-150 in the proton abstraction step of catalysis.

served among all shmts, and an equivalent residue in aspartate aminotransferase trp-140 was shown to be involved in
plp binding (19). the results presented in this paper clearly
demonstrate that his-147 plays a similar role in  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx . like
h134n  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx , this mutant enzyme had very little bound plp
(fig. 1a), indicating that the efficiency of binding plp with the
mutant enzyme had decreased. unlike the h134n  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx , this
mutant enzyme preparation prior to dialysis was present as a
tetramer. the activity of the h147n  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  (0.084 s21) (with
serine as a substrate) was enhanced 9-fold (0.75 s21) upon the
addition of plp (500 mm), corresponding to 17% activity of the
wild type enzyme. however, with l-allo-threonine as a substrate, the increase in activity was only 2.2-fold (table ii). this
could be due to the interference of excess plp (500 mm) with
nadh absorption at 340 nm. it is possible that due to the
decreased affinity for plp, the h147n  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  was less stable
and it dissociated to the dimeric form rapidly (fig. 2b). similarly, the removal of plp from rshmt (fig. 2b) or native sheep
liver  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  (42) resulted in the dissociation of tetramers to
dimers, substantiating the role of plp in maintenance of the
oligomeric structure of the enzyme. the apparent ka for plp
with the tetrameric mutant enzyme was approximately 18
times higher than rshmt. the tetrameric nature of the mutant enzyme, considerable enzyme activity, unaltered km for
serine, and decreased affinity for plp indicated that his-147
might interact with plp through ionic or hydrogen bonding
interactions (fig. 6).
the role of his-150 —his-150 is also highly conserved
among all shmts (table i), although it is not an invariant
residue among other members of the fold type i group of plp
enzymes. this mutant enzyme was isolated predominantly as a
tetramer with bound plp, unlike the h134n and h147n
shmts. despite the presence of bound plp, the mutant enzyme had very little enzyme activity (,2%). this loss in enzyme activity was reflected in the absence of quinonoid intermediate upon the addition of h4-folate to the mutant enzyme in
the presence of glycine or d-alanine (figs. 3a and 4). the proton
exchange studies using [2-3h]glycine (fig. 4b) showed that the
step preceding the formation of quinonoid intermediate (i.e.
proton abstraction) was affected by mutation of his-150 to asn.
the fluorescence quenching and visible cd studies (fig. 5) with
serine and glycine showed that the h150n  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  was capable
of forming the external aldimine, an early event in catalysis.
however, when d-alanine was used as substrate, the km values
for the h150n  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  and rshmt were similar (25 and 30 mm,
respectively), and the kcat decreased by 6-fold, suggesting that
the mutant was capable, although less efficiently, of carrying
out the transamination reaction. these results suggest that in
the absence of his-150, some other proton acceptor might function, although less effectively. a similar observation was reported in the case of d-amino acid transaminase, where a
second lysine residue could partially substitute for the active
site lysine in the catalytic mechanism (10). in analogy with the
scheme of reactions proposed earlier (7), the role of his-150 is
shown in fig. 6. initially the bound plp forms an internal
aldimine with e-amino group of lys-256 (6). the addition of the
substrate (serine and glycine) leads to the formation of the
external aldimine via a geminal diamine. an abstraction of a
proton stereospecifically from the 2-s position of the glycineexternal aldimine complex leads to the formation of the quinonoid intermediate (39). this proton abstraction is facilitated
by the presence of h4-folate. the scheme visualizes the his-150
as the acceptor of this proton. in the presence of 5,10-ch2-h4folate, this proton is probably added back to form serine and
h4-folate. similarly, when serine or other b-hydroxyamino acids (l-allo-threonine and b-phenylserine) are used as sub-
