use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)
for chemoprevention of colon cancer has been hindered by
their potential gastro-intestinal toxicity.  xxxd2688xxx , which
is approximately 10 to 36 times safer than conventional
nsaids, was evaluated in 2 models of experimental colon
carcinogenesis. in azoxymethane (aom)-treated fisher 344
rats,  xxxd2688xxx  caused dose-dependent inhibition of aberrant crypt foci (acf), with 750 and 1,500 ppm resulting in
15% and 37% reductions, respectively (p < 0.05). moreover,
complex acf were reduced by 48% in the latter group. min
mice studies confirmed the chemopreventive efficacy of
 xxxd2688xxx , with 900 ppm suppressing approximately half
of the intestinal tumors. interestingly, inhibition of intermediate biomarkers in both models was markedly greater in the
distal than the proximal bowel. to mechanistically evaluate
this regional selectivity, we assessed cyclo-oxygenase-2
(cox-2) expression in the uninvolved mucosa and demonstrated a 3- to 4-fold excess in the distal relative to the
proximal bowel in both min mice and aom-treated rats. we
then investigated another putative nsaid target, peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-␦ (ppar-␦) and demonstrated up-regulation during aom-induced colonic tumorigenesis. furthermore, in pre-neoplastic mucosa, there was a
3-fold excess of ppar-␦ in the distal colon. we demonstrate
that  xxxd2688xxx  is an effective protective agent in both
experimental models of colon carcinogenesis. the striking
distal predilection of  xxxd2688xxx  may be, at least partially,
explained by distal bowel over-expression of cox-2 and
ppar-␦.

despite significant medical advances in diagnosis and therapy,
colorectal malignancies remain the second leading cause of cancer
mortality in the united states,1 underscoring the need for effective
chemopreventive strategies. a variety of agents have been purported to protect against colon cancer; of these, the non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) have demonstrated the greatest
promise.2 the epidemiological and experimental evidence indicates that nsaids can reduce the risk of colorectal cancer by up
to 50%;3 however, utilization of nsaids for colon-cancer prevention has been hindered by their propensity to cause gastro-intestinal injury.4 to minimize these untoward effects, novel nsaids
have been developed with selectivity for cyclo-oxygenase-2
(cox-2), the cox isoform not expressed in normal gastro-intestinal epithelium.5 cox-2, but not cox-1, is markedly up-regulated early during colon carcinogenesis.3 therefore, selective targeting of cox-2 may afford protection against colorectal cancer
without the gastro-intestinal toxicity associated with depletion of
cox-1-dependent mucosal cytoprotective prostaglandins.
 xxxd2688xxx , an nsaid in widespread clinical use, has a 7-fold
higher affinity for cox-2 than cox-1.6 moreover, a meta-analysis indicates that  xxxd2688xxx  is 10 to 36 times safer than conventional nsaids.7 although there are few data on  xxxd2688xxx ’s
chemoprotective efficacy, we have previously reported that it
caused a dose-dependent suppression of tumors in the min (multiple intestinal neoplasia) mouse.8 the strength of this experimental model is that the initiating genetic events of human colorectal
carcinogenesis are reproduced through a germline mutation in the
 xxxg170xxx  (apc) tumor-suppressor gene.9 apc

truncation leads to over-expression of its downstream effector,
␤-catenin.10 ␤-catenin is a regulator of cox-2 as well as peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-␦ (ppar-␦), another important target for nsaids in the chemoprevention of colon cancer.11
the min mouse, however, is somewhat limited as a model of
colonic carcinogenesis in that most of the tumors are small bowel
adenomas rather than colorectal cancers. colon cancers can be
induced by treatment of rats with the carcinogen azoxymethane
(aom) or its precursor 1,2-dimethylhydrazine.12 in this model, the
apc gene generally remains wild-type, but the high frequency of
activating ␤-catenin mutations produces a functionally equivalent
result.13 cox-2 is generally up-regulated in aom-induced tumors;14 however, no reports exists on ppar-␦ expression in this
model. while tumorigenesis in the aom model generally requires
approximately 35 weeks, aberrant crypt foci (acf) are detectable
within 2 weeks after carcinogen treatment.15 the acf assay is
well validated and frequently used as an intermediate biomarker in
experimental colon cancer-prevention studies. indeed, the data
support the biological importance of acf in human colon carcinogenesis.16
given the limited data on the chemoprotective efficacy of  xxxd2688xxx , our objective was to evaluate the ability of this nsaid to
suppress aom-induced acf in rats as well as intestinal tumors in
min mice. in light of reports that emphasize the biological differences between proximal and distal colon cancers, we were
particularly interested in assessing whether  xxxd2688xxx  would
have regional selectivity in chemoprotection. finally, to understand the mechanisms for the regional variability in  xxxd2688xxx ’s
efficacy, we evaluated both proximal and distal expression of the
putative nsaid targets cox-2 and ppar-␦.

injected twice with aom (99% pure; sigma, st. louis, mo), 15
mg/kg s.c. separated by 1 week. fifteen weeks after the second
injection, rats were killed and their colons removed, rinsed with
saline and bisected. colon segments were fixed in 10% formalin,
stained with 0.2%  xxxd2610xxx  and examined under 40⫻ magnification. acf were scored for location and size by an observer
blinded to treatment group.
min mice
twenty-four 5- to 6-week-old min mice (jackson laboratory,
bar harbor, me) were randomized to an ain 93a diet alone or
 xxxd2688xxx  supplementation at 600, 900 or 1,200 ppm. after 10
weeks, animals were killed, their intestines were removed and
rinsed and the small bowel was bisected. tumors were scored
under magnification by an observer blinded to treatment group. for
analysis of regional tumor distribution, data were combined with
an earlier min mouse experiment (24 mice randomized to ain
93a alone or  xxxd2688xxx  supplementation at 300, 600 or 900
ppm), for which total tumor numbers were previously reported.8
cox-2 and ppar-␦ expression in non-neoplastic mucosa
rat colonocytes were prepared from f344 rats 15 weeks after
the second injection of aom (15 mg/kg s.c.) by a modification of
the weiser technique, which utilizes divalent cation chelation
followed by gentle mechanical dissociation.17 min mouse intestinal mucosa was lightly scraped and frozen at – 80°c. cellular
lysates were obtained by sonicating in laemmli buffer, and protein
concentrations were determined by the amido black method.18
forty micrograms of protein were separated on a 10% sdspolyacrylamide gel electrophoretically, transferred to polyvinylfluoride membranes and stained with india ink to confirm equal
loading of proteins. membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat
milk and probed with a polyclonal antibody to cox-2 or ppar-␦
or a monoclonal antibody (mab) to ␤-tubulin (all from santa cruz
biotechnology, santa cruz, ca). xerograms were developed by
enhanced chemiluminescence (amersham-pharmacia, piscataway,
nj) and quantitated with a scanning laser densitometer.
ppar-␦ immunohistochemistry in aom-treated rats
archived paraffin-embedded sections from f344 rats killed 35
weeks after the second injection of aom (15 mg/kg s.c.) were
prepared for immunohistochemistry using standard methods. after
blocking with serum and quenching endogenous peroxidases, sections were incubated with a polyclonal antibody to ppar-␦ for 1
hr at 37°c. slides were developed with the vectastain abc kit
(vector, burlingame, ca).
results

tolerance of  xxxd2688xxx 
 xxxd2688xxx  administration was well tolerated, with no macroscopic or histological evidence of gastro-intestinal, hepatic or renal
injury. body weight was assessed as another surrogate gauge of
toxicity. f344 rats continued to gain weight throughout the experimental period, and aom treatment did not significantly affect
body weight (data not shown).  xxxd2688xxx  at either 750 or 1,500
ppm did not cause any significant change in weekly body weight
(fig. 1a). the body weight of min mice increased for the first 6
weeks and then began to decline as the tumor burden increased.
 xxxd2688xxx  supplementation, even at 1,200 ppm, did not cause a
significant decrease in body weight when compared to mice on the
control diet (fig. 1b). indeed, there was a slight, but non-significant, trend toward an increase in weight in mice treated with
 xxxd2688xxx , especially during the early phases of the experiment.
effect of  xxxd2688xxx  on intermediate biomarkers of colon
cancer
dietary  xxxd2688xxx  supplementation resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in aom-induced acf (fig. 2a). in animals on the
control diet, there were 293 ⫾ 9 acf including 8 ⫾ 3 complex
acf/colon (defined as ⱖ10 crypts/foci).  xxxd2688xxx  at 750 ppm

caused a 15% decrease in total acf, while at 1,500 ppm it caused
a 37% reduction. with regard to complex acf, there was only a
significant reduction with 1,500 ppm treatment (48%).
the total number of tumors in min mice on the ain 93a diet
alone was 44 ⫾ 3.5/animal, with 90% located in the small intestine
(fig. 2b). all tumors sampled for histological analysis were adenomas. treatment with 600 ppm  xxxd2688xxx  resulted in a 13%
reduction in tumors; however, this failed to reach statistical significance (p ⬍ ⫽ 0.16). the maximal tumor-inhibitory dose of
 xxxd2688xxx  was 900 ppm (43 ⫾ 9%, p ⫽ 0.003), with the 1,200
ppm group demonstrating less tumor inhibition (38 ⫾ 4%, p ⫽
0.001 vs. control).
regional chemopreventive efficacy of  xxxd2688xxx 
in f344 rats on the control diet, 56% of acf were located in the
distal colon. while  xxxd2688xxx  decreased acf throughout the
colon, suppression was accentuated distally (fig. 3a). this reduction in acf number in the distal vs. proximal colon with  xxxd2688xxx  was seen in both the 750 (15 vs. 30, p ⬍ 0.03) and the 1,500
(30 vs. 60 p ⬍ 0.05) ppm groups. this resulted in an increase in the
proximal to distal ratio, from 0.78 in the ain 93a alone group to
1.05 in the 1,500 ppm group (p ⬍ 0.05).
min mice on the control diet also demonstrated a distal predominance of tumors; indeed, only 21% of tumors were located in
the proximal intestine. the reduction in tumors was more marked
in the distal small intestine (fig. 3b). this differential decrease in
tumor number was seen at 600, 900 and 1,200 ppm. when expressed as a percentage of the ain 93a alone group, tumor
inhibition in all 4 treatment groups was still greater distally (80 ⫾

compared to proximally (138 ⫾ 23%, 134 ⫾ 20%, 77 ⫾ 16% and
70 ⫾ 16%, respectively). however, statistically significant proximal vs. distal tumor suppression was achieved only with the 2
lower doses of  xxxd2688xxx .
regional expression of cox-2 in min mice and aom-treated
rats
cox-2 was expressed in both colonocytes of aom-treated rats
and the uninvolved intestinal epithelial scrapings of min mice. in
pre-malignant rat colon, cox-2 was detected faintly in the proximal mucosa but more robustly in the distal mucosa [fig. 4a(i)]. a
proximal to distal cox-2 gradient was evident regardless of
dietary group (308 ⫾ 108% for ain 93a alone vs. 218 ⫾ 55% for
 xxxd2688xxx  1,500 ppm) (fig. 4b), consistent with our previous
observation that cox-2 levels were not altered by  xxxd2688xxx 
treatment.8 the min mouse small bowel also had markedly more
cox-2 expression distally (368 ⫾ 107%, p ⬍ 0.03) (fig. 4b).
regional expression of ppar-␦ in aom-treated rats
we assessed ppar-␦ expression in aom-treated rats as another
putative nsaid target in the chemoprevention of colon carcinogenesis. since no previous reports have assessed ppar-␦ in aominduced tumors, we assessed 10 tumors and detected strong immunoreactivity in the adenomas and adenocarcinomas [fig.
5a(i,ii)]. moreover, ppar-␦ was clearly demonstrated in the un-

involved mucosa, and the staining was more pronounced near the
luminal surface in comparison to the base of the crypt [fig.
5a(iii,iv)]. we then performed western blotting for ppar-␦ in
proximal and distal colonocytes from rats (fig. 5b). immunoblot
analysis demonstrated marked induction of ppar-␦ in the distal
relative to the proximal colon (151 ⫾ 1.7% of proximal colon, p ⬍
0.02) (fig. 5c).
discussion

our study confirms that  xxxd2688xxx  has an excellent safety
profile, with no evidence of toxicity or body weight alterations
even at the highest doses utilized (fig. 1). our data are consistent
with  xxxd2688xxx ’s excellent clinical safety record.7 its improved
safety profile is believed to be multifactorial but at least partly due
to its relative cox-2 selectivity. newer nsaids with even greater
cox-2 selectivity (celecoxib, rofecoxib) also appear to be efficacious in protecting against experimental colon cancer,19 but their
lack of anti-platelet activity (mediated through cox-1) implies
that they would not have a cardiovascular protective effect. this
issue is crucial from a public health perspective since over 80% of
the survival benefit from nsaids is through protection from
myocardial infarctions.20 prostacyclin, which inhibits platelet aggregation, is derived from endothelial cox-2, whereas the proaggregatory thromboxane is derived from platelet cox-1.21 more-

over, cox-2 is important in the cardiac protective effects of
ischemic pre-conditioning.22 therefore, theoretically, highly selective cox-2 inhibitors may actually increase the incidence of acute
coronary events. in support of this hypothesis, there were significantly more myocardial infarctions in patients treated long-term
with the highly selective cox-2 inhibitor rofecoxib compared to
the conventional nsaid naprosyn.23 other potential benefits of
cox-1 inhibition include enhancement of protection against colon
carcinogenesis.24 thus,  xxxd2688xxx , with its safety and anti-platelet activity,25 appears to be an excellent nsaid for use in cancer
prevention.
 xxxd2688xxx  inhibited intermediate biomarkers in both of these
well-validated models of colon cancer. the data support the importance of acf in colon carcinogenesis and its potential utility as
a clinical screening tool. endoscopic detection of acf correlated
well with the presence of colonic adenomas and carcinomas.
moreover, in humans, acf were very sensitive to inhibition by
nsaids such as  xxxd3259xxx .16  xxxd2688xxx ’s dose-dependent suppression of acf was comparable to that observed with other
nsaids. for example,  xxxd3259xxx  320 ppm (the highest tolerated

dose) caused a 36% reduction in acf, while the maximum dose of
 xxxd457xxx , a highly selective cox-2 inhibitor, resulted in a 41%
reduction.25a our data, however, are in contrast to a report that was
unable to demonstrate inhibition in acf with  xxxd2688xxx  80
mg/kg injected s.c.26 this failure of protection may be secondary
to both the intermittent dosing of  xxxd2688xxx  and the parenteral
route of administration, which would be expected to result in a
significantly lower concentration of  xxxd2688xxx  in the colonic
lumen. furthermore, the methodological shortcomings were underscored by the inability to demonstrate chemoprotection with
indomethacin, an nsaid for which there are many reports affirming its ability to inhibit acf formation.27 our aom-rat data are
further supported by our min mouse studies, in which 900 and
1,200 ppm markedly suppressed intestinal adenomas. the approximately 50% reduction with  xxxd2688xxx  is equivalent to reports on
other nsaids using this mouse strain. for instance, treatment with
high-dose  xxxd3259xxx  (84 mg/l of drinking water)28 and aspirin 500
ppm (the highest dose tested)29 caused min mouse tumors to be
reduced by 39% and 48%, respectively.
both the min mouse adenomas and the aom-induced acf
were found predominantly in the distal bowel, consistent with the
distribution of adenomas and carcinomas found in western countries. proximal colonic neoplasms appear to have distinct characteristics in histology, molecular genetics and demographics. for
instance, patients with proximal colon cancers tend to be nonwhite, younger30 and female.31 these proximal tumors are biologically different from distal ones in that they are generally less
differentiated,32 have a higher propensity for microsatellite instability (tumors whose genetic initiation is via loss of dna mismatch repair capability with concomitant diffuse genetic instability)31 and have more frequent inactivation of the p16 tumorsuppressor gene.33 the genetic and pathological changes may
correlate with clinical characteristics and natural history. rightsided tumors have a better prognosis and are more sensitive to
adjuvant chemotherapy than those on the left.31 potential coloncancer risk factors such as cholecystectomies,34 obesity and sedentary lifestyle35 may predispose more to proximal malignancies.
this regional variability is also seen with chemopreventive agents;
e.g., several epidemiological studies suggest that folate36 and possibly estrogens37 target the proximal colon. chemoprotection in
experimental models also appears to be site-specific with both
 xxxd2782xxx  and dl-d- xxxd2430xxx  protecting preferentially against distal aom-induced tumors in rats.38
we demonstrated a marked accentuation of  xxxd2688xxx ’s
ability to suppress acf in the distal colon. this observation
was duplicated in min mice, where the efficacy of  xxxd2688xxx 
was considerably greater in the distal small bowel, especially at
low doses. the mechanism for the distal predilection of  xxxd2688xxx  in both models remains to be elucidated but may relate
to regional differences in cox-2 expression, a presumptive
target for nsaids in colon carcinogenesis. genetic and pharmacological inhibition of cox-2 underscores its importance in
colon-cancer prevention.39 in the pre-malignant mucosa of the
aom-rat, there was considerably greater cox-2 detected in
distal as opposed to proximal colon. this regional distribution
of cox-2 was confirmed in the uninvolved small bowel mucosa
of the min mouse, with 4-fold greater cox-2 expression
distally. our data are supported by results demonstrating a
robust increase in cox-2 expression distally in the uninvolved
min mouse mucosa.40 the importance of gradients of cox-2
expression to the regional efficacy of  xxxd2688xxx  is suggested
by the demonstration that genetic deletion of cox-2 decreased
min mouse tumors more markedly in the distal than the proximal small bowel.24 furthermore, the distal predominance of
cox-2 expression appears to be important in human sporadic
colon carcinogenesis, with rectal cancers over-expressing
cox-2 in 90% of cases whereas more proximal tumors upregulate cox-2 only 22% of the time.41 in our study, the
cellular constituents responsible for cox-2 expression were not
determined, but previous data indicate that expression of both

epithelial and stromal cox-2 is important during carcinogenesis.42 while the correlation between cox-2 expression and
 xxxd2688xxx ’s chemopreventive efficacy is striking, there are
several lines of evidence to suggest that this may be simplistic.
for example, nsaid derivatives without anti-prostaglandin

613

activity (i.e.,  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone, r-fluoribuprofen) were still able
to protect against experimental colon cancer and induce cellular
apoptosis.43,44 ppar-␦ has been demonstrated to be a putative
target, being over-expressed as a consequence of apc mutations in colorectal neoplasia.45 nsaids not only transcriptionally regulate this member of the nuclear receptor superfamily
but also inhibit the ability of ppar-␦ to bind to dna. we
demonstrated that ppar-␦ is also up-regulated in colon adenomas and carcinomas in the aom-rat model, where the apc
gene generally remains wild-type. while we did not evaluate
ppar-␦ in min mice, given its germline mutation in apc, we
would anticipate significant over-expression during tumorigenesis. in aom-treated rats, ppar-␦ was detectable in the uninvolved mucosa by immunohistochemistry and western blot
analysis. moreover, expression of ppar-␦, like cox-2, was
markedly increased in the distal colon when compared to the
proximal, consistent with a preliminary report that ppar-␦ and
cox-2 co-localize in colorectal cancer.46
the present study is in agreement with results demonstrating
that, in min mice, the nsaid  xxxd2969xxx  was markedly more
effective at tumor suppression in the distal and mid-small bowel
when compared to the proximal small bowel.47 however, in a
report utilizing the aom-rat model,  xxxd2969xxx  suppressed 82% of
proximal tumors and only 57% of those in the distal colon.38
therefore, localization of these putative nsaid targets is probably
not the complete answer for the site specificity of  xxxd2688xxx .
another potential explanation is the differential sensitivity to apoptosis in the proximal and distal colon. inhibition of apoptosis is
a crucial early event in colorectal carcinogenesis,48 which may be
reversed by nsaid treatment.49 previous reports with the aomrat model have demonstrated marked regional variability in apoptosis,50 and in humans, apoptosis is markedly increased in the
distal colon.51 unfortunately, there are no data on the differential
effects of nsaids on the proximal vs. distal bowel with regard to
apoptosis per se or induction of important mediators in the
nsaid-apoptosis response, such as the prostate apoptosis response-4 gene52 or 15-lipoxygenase 1.53 however, endoscopic
studies in humans suggest that the pro-apoptotic protein bak is
over-expressed in the distal colon, correlating with greater basal
apoptosis in this location.51 while we did not evaluate regional
differences in apoptosis or apoptosis mediators, we have previously reported that  xxxd2688xxx  down-regulated anti-apoptotic
bcl-2 in both cell culture and min mice.8 since bak expression is
greater in the distal colon, one could speculate that the balance
between pro- and anti-apoptotic forces might be more greatly
altered toward cell death in the distal colon.
there are a variety of other potential explanations for the
regional chemopreventive efficacy. biologically, the proximal and
distal colon vary markedly in fecal bile acid exposure, inherent
carcinogen-detoxifying proteins and mucin production,32 all conceivable targets for  xxxd2688xxx . also, pharmacological properties
of these nsaids may play a role in their site specificity. nine
percent of an oral dose of  xxxd2688xxx  is recovered from the feces
(manufacturer’s data). one could postulate that the different chemical properties among nsaids may alter the contact time with the
proximal and distal colonic epithelium. in summary, there are
several biologically plausible mechanisms for  xxxd2688xxx ’s regional selectivity in the inhibition of colon carcinogenesis, includ-

ing over-expression of cox-2 and ppar-␦. further studies will be
conducted to elucidate the mechanism(s) involved in this clinically
and biologically important observation.
in conclusion,  xxxd2688xxx  was effective in the aom model of
colorectal carcinogenesis. these data are complemented by the
demonstration that  xxxd2688xxx  inhibited intestinal tumors in min
mice. in both experimental models, the efficacy of  xxxd2688xxx 

was markedly greater in the distal than the proximal colon. this
may be related, at least in part, to over-expression of cox-2 and
ppar-␦ in this region. these findings have implications for the
study of the biology involved in colon carcinogenesis and underscore the necessity of focusing on regional differences of chemopreventive agents in designing effective colon cancer-prevention
strategies.
