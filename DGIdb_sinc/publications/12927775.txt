structure-based design of  xxxd113xxx , a novel orally effective renin inhibitor.  hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases such as stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure, the leading causes of death in the western world. inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (ras) have proven to be successful treatments for hypertension. as renin specifically catalyses the rate-limiting step of the ras, it represents the optimal target for ras inhibition. several peptide-like renin inhibitors have been synthesized previously, but poor pharmacokinetic properties meant that these compounds were not clinically useful. we employed a combination of molecular modelling and crystallographic structure analysis to design renin inhibitors lacking the extended peptide-like backbone of earlier inhibitors, for improved pharmacokinetic properties. this led to the discovery of  xxxd113xxx , a highly potent and selective inhibitor of human renin in vitro, and in vivo; once-daily oral doses of  xxxd113xxx  inhibit renin and lower blood pressure in sodium-depleted marmosets and hypertensive human patients.  xxxd113xxx  represents the first in a novel class of renin inhibitors with the potential for treatment of hypertension and related cardiovascular diseases.
