physiological and pharmacological experiments have revealed
that the uptake of organic anions in the liver and kidney across
the basolateral membrane occur via transporters possessing a
wide substrate selectivity (1–5). in the liver, the organic anion
transporting polypeptide 1 ( xxxg2163xxx )1 and  xxxg2164xxx  are multispecific
organic anion transporters that transport structurally
unrelated organic anions in a sodium-independent manner
(1, 2, 6, 7).
in regard to the kidney,  xxxg2113xxx  (oat1/
 xxxg2113xxx ) has recently been isolated from the rat kidney (8, 9).
oat1 is a multispecific organic anion transporter that interacts with a variety of organic anions such as p-aminohippurate
(pah), dicarboxylates, cyclic nucleotides,  xxxd1903xxx ,
urate, b-lactam antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, and diuretics (8). the transport characteristics of oat1
are identical to those of the classical organic anion transporter
on the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubule (3–5, 8, 9).
a search of a dna data base revealed that the amino acid
sequence of novel liver-specific transport protein (nlt) (10)
shows 42% identity to that of oat1 (11). we demonstrated that
nlt also mediated the transport of organic anions such as
pah, salicylate and  xxxd234xxx ,  xxxd1903xxx , and
dicarboxylates and concluded that nlt is a liver-specific organic anion transporter ( xxxg2114xxx ) (11).
in contrast to the liver and kidney, little is known concerning
the organic anion transport in the brain. the brain possesses
two physiological barriers, namely, blood-brain barrier (bbb)
and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (bcsfb), which prevent
the entry of xenobiotics into the brain (12–14). the tight junction, an anatomical feature of bbb and bcsfb, connects brain
capillary endothelial cells or choroid epithelial cells to each
other and minimizes the influx of xenobiotics via paracellular
routes (12–14). in addition, in vivo and in vitro kinetic studies
have suggested the presence of efflux transport pathways for
organic anions in the bbb and bcsfb. pah and  xxxd2871xxx , typical substrates of the renal organic anion transporter,
have been demonstrated to be effluxed from the brain (15–17).
when injected into the cerebral cortex, the rapid and saturable
elimination of pah from the brain was observed (15). the
efflux of  xxxd2871xxx  and cimetidine via bcsfb was also
reported to be saturable process (16 –18). based on the results
of these studies, the presence of a kidney-like organic anion
efflux transporter(s) has been predicted in the brain. oat1 and

a cdna encoding the new member of the multispecific
organic anion transporter family,  xxxg2115xxx , was isolated by
the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
cloning method. degenerate primers were designed
based on the sequences conserved among oat1,  xxxg2114xxx ,
and organic cation transporter 1 (oct1), and reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed
using rat brain poly(a)1 rna. the 536-amino acid protein sequence encoded by  xxxg2115xxx  showed 49, 39, and 36%
identity to those of oat1,  xxxg2114xxx , and oct1, respectively.
northern blot analysis revealed that rat  xxxg2115xxx  mrna is
expressed in the liver, brain, kidney, and eye. when
expressed in xenopus laevis oocytes,  xxxg2115xxx  mediated the
uptake of organic anions, such as p-aminohippurate (km
5 65 mm), ochratoxin a (km 5 0.74 mm), and  xxxd2046xxx  (km 5 2.3 mm) and a cationic compound, cimetidine.
 xxxg2115xxx -mediated uptake of [3h] xxxd2046xxx  was sodium-independent. para-aminohippuric acid,  xxxd2046xxx  or ochratoxin a did not show any trans-stimulatory
effect on either influx or efflux of [3h] xxxd2046xxx  via
 xxxg2115xxx . organic anions such as sulfobromophthalein,
 xxxd3013xxx , indocyanine green, bumetanide,  xxxd2969xxx ,
furosemide,  xxxd3553xxx , 4,4*-diisothiocyanostilbene-3,3*-disulfonic acid, and  xxxd2871xxx  inhibited  xxxg2115xxx -mediated  xxxd2046xxx  uptake, while ouabain and digoxin did not. organic cations such as
tetraethylammonium, guanidine, verapamil, and quinidine did not interact with  xxxg2115xxx . acidic metabolites of
neurotransmitters derived from dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and serotonin inhibited the uptake of  xxxd2046xxx  via  xxxg2115xxx . these results suggest
an important role of  xxxg2115xxx  in the excretion/detoxification of endogenous and exogenous organic anions, especially from the brain.

isolation and characterization of  xxxg2115xxx 

 xxxg2114xxx  are expressed specifically in the kidney and liver, respectively (8, 9, 11). although oat1 was detected in the brain, its
expression level was very small (8). from these observations,
we hypothesized the existence of a new member of the oat
family in the brain. in the present study, we report the isolation of the new member of oat family,  xxxg2115xxx , which is much
more strongly expressed in the brain than oat1.
experimental procedures

results

a pcr product was isolated from rat brain mrna using
reverse transcription-pcr method. and its partial amino acid
sequence exhibited some identity to oat1. using this as a
probe, we isolated a novel cdna (rkl411) from the rat kidney
cdna library. when expressed in x. laevis oocytes, rkl411
mediated the uptake of several organic anions; we therefore
designated rkl411 as  xxxg2115xxx  ( xxxg2115xxx ).
 xxxg2115xxx  cdna consists of 2191 base pairs encoding a membrane
protein of 536 amino acids. fig. 1 shows the deduced amino
acid sequence of rat  xxxg2115xxx  and the alignment with those of rat
oat1,  xxxg2114xxx , oct1, and oct2 (20). the amino acid sequence
of  xxxg2115xxx  shows 49, 39, 36, and 35% identity to those of rat
oat1,  xxxg2114xxx , oct1,and oct2, respectively (table i). recently, a third member of organic cation transporter, rat oct3,
was isolated (21). its amino acid sequence showed 35% identity
to that of  xxxg2115xxx  (table i). four putative n-glycosylation sites
and eight protein kinase c-dependent phosphorylation sites
are predicted; two n-glycosylation sites in the first loop between transmembrane domains 1 and 2 (54 and 102 residues),
and two protein kinase c-dependent phosphorylation sites between transmembrane domains 6 and 7 (259 and 266 residues)
are identical with those of oat1 (fig. 1). kyte-doolittle (31)
hydropathy analysis suggests that  xxxg2115xxx  possess 12 putative
membrane-spanning domains.
the tissue distribution of  xxxg2115xxx  was investigated by northern blot analysis using poly(a)1 rna from various rat tissues
(fig. 2). a strong 2.7-kilobase mrna band was detected in the
brain, liver, kidney, and weakly in the eye. no hybridization
signals were detected with mrna isolated from other tissues.
a slightly short transcript (2.2 kilobases) was detected only in
the liver (fig. 2).
using xenopus oocytes injected with  xxxg2115xxx  crna, we investigated the transport characteristics via  xxxg2115xxx .  xxxg2115xxx  mediated
the transport of [3h]pah, [3h] xxxd2046xxx , [3h]ochratoxin
a, and [3h]cimetidine (fig. 3), but not salicylate,  xxxd3296xxx ,
digoxin, tetraethylammonium (tea), guanidine, and  xxxd1816xxx  (data not shown). the uptake of  xxxd2046xxx  via
 xxxg2115xxx  was not affected by the replacement of extracellular
sodium with lithium, choline, or n-methyl-d-glucamine (fig. 4).
we examined whether trans-stimulatory effect was observed in
the transport via  xxxg2115xxx .  xxxd2046xxx , ochratoxin a, and
pah, when added to the medium, did not stimulate efflux of
the preloaded  xxxd2046xxx  via  xxxg2115xxx  (fig. 5a). vice versa,
intracellulary accumulated unlabeled pah, ochratoxin a, or
 xxxd2046xxx  did not stimulate the uptake of [3h]estrone
sulfate (fig. 5b). concentration dependence of the uptake of
[3h]pah, [3h] xxxd2046xxx , and [3h]ochratoxin a via  xxxg2115xxx 
was examined (fig. 6).  xxxg2115xxx -mediated uptake of these com-

materials—[3h]pah (2.45 ci/mmol) and [3h] xxxd2046xxx  (53 ci/
mmol) were purchased from nen life science products. [3h]ochratoxin a (14.8 ci/mmol) was purchased from moravek (brea, ca).
[32p]dctp and [3h]cimetidine (18.2 ci/mmol) were obtained from amersham pharmacia biotech (uppsala, sweden). all other chemicals and
reagents were of analytical grade.
reverse transcription-pcr—degenerate pcr primers were designed based on the amino acid sequences that are conserved among
oat1,  xxxg2114xxx  (nlt) and oct1 (19): forward primer, 59-tymywgartchscmcgstgg-39 (corresponding to the nucleotide 803– 822 of
oat1) and reverse primer, 59-aksamwgtrgggtacarctc-39 (corresponding to the nucleotide 1339 –1358 of oat1). one microgram of
poly(a)1 rna prepared from rat brain was reverse-transcribed and
used as a template for subsequent pcr with the set of degenerate
primers. pcr was performed according to the following protocol: 94 °c
for 10 s, 49 °c for 30 s, and 72 °c for 30 s; 40 cycles. pcr products were
isolated using ta cloning kit (invitrogen) and sequenced. a pcr product, whose partial amino acid sequence showed 55% identity to that of
oat1, was labeled with [32p]dctp by random priming method (t7
quick prime kit, amersham pharmacia biotech) and used for the
screening of  xxxg2115xxx  as a probe. since the preliminary northern blot
analysis revealed that the mrna detected by this probe was abundantly expressed in the kidney, we used the rat kidney cdna library for
the screening.
construction of cdna library and isolation of  xxxg2115xxx —a nondirectional cdna library was prepared from rat kidney poly(a)1 rna using
the superscript choice system (life techonologies, inc.), and the
cdnas were ligated into lziplox ecori arms (life techonologies, inc.).
replicated filters of a phage library were hybridized overnight at 37 °c
in a hybridization solution (50% formamide, 5 3 standard saline citrate
(ssc), 3 3 denhardt’s solution, 0.2% sds, 10%  xxxd1860xxx , 0.2
mg/ml denatured salmon sperm dna, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate,
25 mm mes, and 0.01% antifoam b, ph 6.5), and washed at 37 °c in
0.1 3 ssc and 0.1% sds. the cdna inserts in positive lziplox phages
were recovered in plasmid pzl1 by in vivo excision and further subcloned into pbluscript ii  xxxg1265xxx  (stratagene) for sequencing and in vitro
transcription.
sequence determination—deleted clones obtained by kilosequence
deletion kit (takara, japan), and specially synthesized oligonucleotide
primers were used for sequencing of  xxxg2115xxx  cdna.
crna synthesis and uptake experiments using x. laevis oocytes—
crna synthesis and uptake measurements were performed as described previously (8). the capped crnas were synthesized in vitro
using t7 rna polymerase from the plasmid dnas linearized with
xbai. defolliculated oocytes were injected with 10 ng of the capped
crna and incubated in barth’s solution (88 mm nacl, 1 mm kcl, 0.33
mm ca(no3)2, 0.4 mm cacl2, 0.8 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 2.4 mm nahco3, and 10
mm hepes) containing 50 mg/ml gentamicin and 2.5 mm pyruvate, ph
7.4, at 18 °c. after incubation for 2–3 days, uptake experiments were
performed at room temperature in nd96 solution (96 mm nacl, 2 mm
kcl, 1.8 mm cacl2, 1 mm mgcl2, and 5 mm hepes, ph 7.4). the uptake
experiment was initiated by replacing nd96 solution with that containing a radiolabeled ligand and terminated by the addition of ice-cold
nd96 buffer after 1 h of incubation. oocytes were washed five times
with ice-cold nd96 and solubilized with 10% sds, and the accumulated
radioactivity was determined.
the kinetic parameters for the uptake of pah,  xxxd2046xxx , and
ochratoxin a via  xxxg2115xxx  were estimated from the following equation: v 5
vmax 3 s/(km 1 s), where v is the uptake rate of the substrate (picomoles/hour/oocyte), s is the substrate concentration in the medium
(micromolar), km is the michaelis-menten constant (micromolar), and
vmax is the maximum uptake rate (picomoles/hour/oocyte). to obtain
the kinetic parameters, the equation was fitted to the  xxxg2115xxx -specific
transport velocity, which was obtained by subtracting the transport
velocity in noninjected oocytes from that in  xxxg2115xxx -expressing oocytes,
by an iterative nonlinear least squares method using a multi program. the input data were weighted as the reciprocal of the observed
values, and the damping gauss newton method algorithm was used for

fitting. the fitted line was converted to the v/s versus v form (eadiehofstee plot).
examination of trans-stimulatory effect on the transport via
 xxxg2115xxx —in order to examine the trans-stimulatory effet on the efflux of
radiolabeled substrate, oocytes expressing  xxxg2115xxx  were preloaded with
[3h] xxxd2046xxx  (80 nm in the medium) for 90 min and then transferred into the medium with or without unlabeled substrates (pah,
ochratoxin a, and  xxxd2046xxx ). both the radioactivity in the medium and that remaining in oocytes were determined after 90-min
incubation. in the experiment examining trans-stimulatory effect on
the influx of radiolabeled substrate, oocytes expressing  xxxg2115xxx  were
preloaded with unlabeled substrates for 5 h and then transferred into
the medium containing [3h] xxxd2046xxx  (40 nm). the uptake rate of
[3h] xxxd2046xxx  for 1 h was determined.
northern blot analysis—three mg of poly(a)1 rna prepared from
various rat tissues were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde
gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter. the filter was hybridized
in a hybridization solution overnight at 42 °c with a full-length cdna
of  xxxg2115xxx , which was randomly labeled with [32p]dctp. the filter was
washed finally in 0.1 3 ssc and 0.1% sds at 60 °c.

pounds showed saturable kinetics and followed the michaelismenten equation. nonlinear regression analyses yielded km
values of 64.7 6 10.0 mm, 2.34 6 0.20 mm, and 0.739 6 0.178 mm
and vmax values of 23.3 6 2.8 pmol/h/oocyte, 7.60 6 0.44 pmol/
h/oocyte, and 3.08 6 0.33 pmol/h/oocyte for pah,  xxxd2046xxx , and ochratoxin a, respectively.
to investigate the substrate selectivity, the inhibitory effect
of various compounds on  xxxg2115xxx -mediated [3h] xxxd2046xxx 
uptake was determined (fig. 7). cis-inhibitory effects were
observed for structurally unrelated organic anions; sulfobromophthalein,  xxxd3013xxx , indocyanine green, bumetanide,  xxxd2969xxx , furosemide,  xxxd3553xxx ,  xxxd2871xxx ,

in the present study, we report the isolation of multispecific
 xxxg2115xxx  ( xxxg2115xxx ).  xxxg2115xxx  encodes a 536-amino acid protein, which shows 49, 39, 36, and 35% identity to
rat oat1,  xxxg2114xxx , oct1, and oct2, respectively (table i). a
search of a dna data base during the revision of this manuscript revealed that  xxxg2115xxx  shows 92% identity to a newly published sequence of roct (reduced in osteosclerosis transporter)
(22) in amino acid level. although its function has not been
elucidated, the reduced expression level of roct was observed in
the oc mouse (a model animal for osteopetrosis) (22). accordingly, we speculate that roct is a murine homologue of  xxxg2115xxx .
when expressed in x. laevis oocytes,  xxxg2115xxx  mediated the
uptake of pah,  xxxd2046xxx , ochratoxin a, and cimetidine in
a sodium-independent manner. in contrast to the fact that
oat1 is apparently an exchanger, we did not observe any
trans-stimulatory effect in  xxxg2115xxx -mediated transport of estrone
sulfate. trans-stimulatory effect was not also observed in the
experiments using  xxxg2114xxx  (11); intracellulary accumulated unlabeled dicarboxylate, a substrate of  xxxg2114xxx , did not stimulate
the uptake of salicylate via  xxxg2114xxx  (11). these results suggest
that the transport characteristic(s) of  xxxg2114xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  may be
different from those of oat1. there seems to be the other
possibility that unidentified endogenous substrate(s), which is
abundantly existing in the x. laevis oocytes, may mask the
trans-stimulatory effect. whether  xxxg2114xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  surely catalyze one way influx remains to be clarified in further studies.
since the uptake of  xxxd2046xxx  via  xxxg2115xxx  was not cisinhibited by organic cations (tea, guanidine, verapamil, and
quinidine),  xxxg2115xxx  is considered to specifically recognize organic

inhibition by  xxxd3296xxx ,  xxxd1685xxx , cefoperazone, and methotrexate was moderate, and that by indomethacin, ouabain,
digoxin, and cationic compounds, such as tea, guanidine,
quinidine, and verapamil was minimal or not observed at all
(fig. 7). acidic metabolites of neurotransmitters derived from
dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, such as 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic
acid, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymandelic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, and those from serotonin, such as 5-methoxyindol-3-acetic acid, 5-hydroxyindol-3-acetic acid and 5-methoxytryptophol potently inhibited the uptake of [3h]estrone
sulfate by  xxxg2115xxx -expressing oocytes, while 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid did not (fig. 8).

compounds with anionic moieties. nonetheless,  xxxg2115xxx  transports cimetidine, which is a weak base (fig. 3). cimetidine is
known to be a bisubstrate, because the uptake of cimetidine
into isolated proximal tubular cells of the rat was inhibited by
both  xxxd3013xxx  and tea (23). ullrich et al. (24) investigated
the recognition of bisubstrates by the renal organic anion and
cation transporters using the stop-flow peritubular capillary
microperfusion method. they demonstrated that hydrophobic
imidazole analogues with electronegative side group, such as
cimetidine, can interact with both transporters, although imidazole by itself did not interact with the renal organic anion
transporter. from these results, they emphasized on the importance of hydrophobicity and partial charge, but not net
charges of the substrates. interaction of bisubstrates with both
organic anion and cation transporters may be explained by the
structural similarity of the oat family and oct family (table
i). based on these hypothesis, a family including both the oat
and oct family was proposed (8, 25). now the molecular structures of three organic anion transporters and three organic
cation transporters have been revealed. the analyses of the
sequence of these transporters may provide clues as to the
substrate binding sites of the transporters, especially the sites
for charge(s) recognition.
there exist both similarities and differences in substrate
selectivity and transport properties among members of the
oat family. oat1,  xxxg2114xxx , and  xxxg2115xxx  are all multispecific
transporters, and pah is a common substrate; however, their

affinity for, and rates of transport of pah, are different among
the oat family. kinetic analysis revealed that the km value of
 xxxg2115xxx  for pah was 65 mm, which is 4-fold larger than the
previously reported value determined using oat1-expressing
oocytes (8). although the expression level of oat1 and  xxxg2115xxx  in
oocytes is not normalized, vmax values for pah were a 10-fold
difference between oat1 and  xxxg2115xxx  (;240 pmol/h/oocyte for
oat1 and 24 pmol/h/oocyte for  xxxg2115xxx ). thus, the clearance for
uptake at tracer concentrations (cluptake) defined as the
vmax/km of pah, is 40-fold different between oat1 and  xxxg2115xxx .
another member of the oat family,  xxxg2114xxx , also showed relatively small transport activity for pah compared with that of

 xxxg2115xxx -expressing oocytes were measured at the concentration indicated
after incubation for 1 h (mean 6 s.e.; n 5 10).  xxxg2115xxx -mediated transport was obtained by subtracting the transport velocity in noninjected
oocytes from that in  xxxg2115xxx -expressing oocytes.

oat1 (11). this difference in the transport activity for pah
among the members of the oat family may be related to the
fact that pah is excreted mainly in the urine. other than pah,
there are distinct differences in substrate selectivity between
oat1,  xxxg2114xxx , and  xxxg2115xxx . indomethacin is a potent inhibitor of
renal organic anion transporter (oat1); however, their inhibitory activity on the transport by  xxxg2115xxx  is weak. on the contrary,  xxxd2871xxx  strongly inhibited  xxxg2115xxx -mediated pah
uptake, but only slightly inhibited oat1-mediated transport,
suggesting that the affinity of  xxxd2871xxx  for oat1 is
weaker than that for  xxxg2115xxx . actually,  xxxd2871xxx  is a good
substrate for  xxxg2115xxx  rather than for oat1 on the basis of km
value and transport activity of  xxxd2871xxx  (data not
shown).  xxxg2114xxx  transports salicylate, but not  xxxd2046xxx ,
and vice versa,  xxxg2115xxx  transports  xxxd2046xxx  but not salicylate. thus, oat1,  xxxg2114xxx , and  xxxg2115xxx  have distinct transport
properties, despite the fact that they belong to the same transporter family. the relatively low structural similarities among
oat1,  xxxg2114xxx , and  xxxg2115xxx  (less than 50% identity each other)
may be relevant to these functional differences.

a northern blot analysis revealed the expression of  xxxg2115xxx  in
the brain. oat1 and  xxxg2114xxx  are expressed predominantly in the
kidney and liver, respectively. the strong expression of  xxxg2115xxx 
in the brain suggests its physiological role in the brain such as
in the efflux pathway via the bbb and/or the bcsfb. it has
been demonstrated that pah, when microinjected into the
cerebral cortex, is eliminated from the brain in a concentrationdependent manner via the bbb (15). carrier-mediated efflux
transport of  xxxd2871xxx  and cimetidine from the cerebrospinal fluid have been also demonstrated (16, 18). suzuki et al.
(16, 18) reported that the transport of  xxxd2871xxx  was
sodium-independent and inhibited by pah and that the elimination of cimetidine from the cerebrospinal fluid was inhibited
by  xxxd2871xxx  and pah, but not by n1-methylnicotinamide, a typical substrate for organic cation transporters.
these results suggest that the efflux transport properties of
organic anions via the bbb and/or bcsfb are consistent with
transport by the oat family, especially  xxxg2115xxx . since pah and
cimetidine are transported by  xxxg2115xxx , and  xxxd2871xxx  inhibits the uptake of  xxxd2046xxx  by  xxxg2115xxx ,  xxxg2115xxx  may be
responsible for the efflux transport of these organic anions via
the bbb and/or bcsfb. in fact, a preliminary immunohistochemical analysis revealed the positive staining of  xxxg2115xxx  in the
choroid plexus (data not shown). in addition to these exogenous
compounds, metabolites of neurotransmitters are also candidate substrates for  xxxg2115xxx . after being released from presynaptic neurons, certain amounts of neurotransmitters are metab-

olized by monoamine oxidase and  xxxg487xxx .
finally, anionic compounds such  xxxd79xxx   xxxd1710xxx ,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic
acid, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid, 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymandelic acid, 5-methoxyindol-3acetic acid, 5-methoxytryptophol, and 5-hydroxyindol-3-acetic
acid, are produced. since all the anionic metabolites, except 3,4dihydroxymandelic acid, inhibited organic anion transport via
 xxxg2115xxx , they may be endogenous substrates of  xxxg2115xxx . future
immunohistochemical analysis will reveal the distribution/localization of  xxxg2115xxx  in the brain and provide clues to understanding
the more precisely physiological role of  xxxg2115xxx .
 xxxg2163xxx  and  xxxg2164xxx  are also multispecific organic anion transporters expressed in the brain. their substrate specificities are
quite similar except digoxin;  xxxg2164xxx  transports digoxin, but
 xxxg2163xxx  does not (7).  xxxg2163xxx  has been demonstrated to be localized
specifically on the brush border membrane of choroid epithelial
cells (26), while the localization of  xxxg2164xxx  in the brain has not
been determined. there are common substrates for  xxxg2115xxx  and
the members of  xxxg2163xxx  family (e.g.  xxxd2046xxx  and ochratoxin
a); however, the substrate selectivity of these two families
overlaps little. the transporter(s) responsible for the efflux
transport, via bbb and/or bcsfb, of naphthol glucuronide,
 xxxd1876xxx ,  xxxd3553xxx , and  xxxd3485xxx  has
not been identified (27–30). the functional analysis and localization of  xxxg2163xxx ,  xxxg2164xxx , and  xxxg2115xxx  will clarify the molecular
mechanisms of the organic anion transport in the brain.
in conclusion, the third member of the multispecific organic
anion transporter family was isolated from the rat brain.
among the members of the oat family,  xxxg2115xxx  is the most
abundantly expressed in the brain. the substrate selectivity of
 xxxg2115xxx  is different from the substrate selectivities of oat1 and
 xxxg2114xxx , and the characteristics of transport via this transporter
are similar to those of the previously reported efflux transport
system in the brain. localization and further functional analysis of  xxxg2115xxx  will provide important information on the distribution and transport of organic anions, especially in the brain.
