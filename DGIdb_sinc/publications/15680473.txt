abstract
cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (cart) is widely expressed in the rat central nervous system, notably in areas involved in
control of autonomic and neuroendocrine functions. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of cart peptide fragment 55–102,
referred to herein as cartp, by intrathecal injection on blood pressure (bp) and heart rate (hr) before and after intrathecal glutamate in
urethane-anesthetized male sprague–dawley rats. cartp (0.1–10 nmol) administered intrathecally caused no or a small, statistically
insignificant increase of blood pressure and heart rate, except at the concentration of 10 nmol, which caused a significant increase of blood
pressure and heart rate. intrathecal glutamate (0.1–10 nmol) produced a dose-dependent increase in arterial pressure and heart rate.
pretreatment with cartp dose-dependently potentiated the pressor effects of glutamate (1 nmol), which by itself elicited a moderate increase
of blood pressure and heart rate. further, cartp significantly potentiated the tachycardic effect of glutamate at 1 and 5 nmol, but attenuated
the response  xxxd1891xxx  nmol. the effect of cartp was long-lasting, as it enhanced glutamatergic responses up to 90 min after administration.
prior injection of cartp antiserum (1:500) but not normal rabbit serum nullified the potentiating effect of cartp on glutamatergic
responses. the result suggests that cartp, whose immunoreactivity is detectable in sympathetic preganglionic neurons as well as in fibers
projecting into the intermediolateral cell column, augments spinal sympathetic outflow elicited by glutamate at lower concentrations and may
directly excite neurons in the intermediolateral cell column at higher concentrations.

1. introduction
sympathetic preganglionic neurons (spns) correspond to
the final station where neural activity related to cardiovascular, pulmonary and visceral function is integrated within
the central nervous system [7,12,25]. in addition to intraspinal inputs, spns receive projections from supraspinal
areas such as the a5 noradrenergic cell group, caudal raphe,
hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, rostral ventrolateral

ventrolateral medulla is recognized as one of the pressor
areas where some of the neurons project directly to the iml
region of the spinal cord.
cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (cart)
is up regulated by cocaine or amphetamine [9]. immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization studies reveal an
extensive distribution of cart or protein in the central and
peripheral nervous system of the rat [3,4,6,9,10,16]. in the
present context, cart-like immunoreactivity (cart-li) is
expressed in a population of c1 adrenergic neurons of the
rvlm [11]. electron microscopic studies reveal synapticlike contacts between cart-immunoreactive terminals and
spns, raising the possibility that the peptide may modulate
the activity of spns [11]. the peptide has been shown to be

biologically active in several systems. for example, cart
peptide (cartp) when injected intracerebroventricularly
increases arterial pressure and renal sympathetic nerve
activity in conscious rabbits [20]. further, we have
previously shown that cartp administered into the nucleus
of the solitary tract attenuated baroreflex in anesthetized rats
[22].
l-glutamate is thought to be the primary excitatory
neurotransmitter acting on spns to generate phasic and/or
tonic vasomotor tone [7,13–15,18,19,26]. several peptides
and catecholamines have also been shown to affect spinal
autonomic functions [7]. to better understand how
various transmitters are engaged in central regulation of
cardiovascular functions, we explore the action of
glutamate and neuropeptides individually or cooperatively.
the present study was undertaken to evaluate the
cardiovascular effects of intrathecally injected cartp
alone and in combination of glutamate in anesthetized
rats.

pinching the tail. rectal temperature was maintained at
37f1 8c with the use of a thermo-blanket.
2.2. blood pressure measurements
the right femoral artery was cannulated with a
polyethylene tubing (intramedic pe-50) and connected
to a pressure transducer with its output to a gould pen
recorder. the blood pressure (bp) signal was used to
trigger a biotach amplifier (gould ecg/bitac’) for heart
rate (hr) recording. mean arterial pressure (map) was
measured directly from the pre-calibrated chart recorder or
calculated using the equation [s d/3+d], where s is
systolic pressure and d is diastolic pressure. to maintain
the depth of anesthesia, the right femoral vein was
cannulated for subsequent intravenous administrations of
urethane (30–60 mg/kg), which was given, as needed,
usually every 1.5–2 h. all intravenous injections were
conducted via a 1-ml tuberculin syringe mounted on an
infusion pump (kd scientific, new hope, pa) at a rate
of 3.5 al/s.

2. materials and methods
2.3. intrathecal injection
2.1. animal protocols
a breeding colony of sprague–dawley rats (harlan,
indianapolis, in) was established at the division of
laboratory animal resources, east tennessee state university. animals were maintained at 22f1 8c with an
alternating 12:12-h light–dark cycle. food and water were
available ad libitum. animal protocols were reviewed and
approved by the institution animal care and use committee. male sprague–dawley rats, weighing 250–350 g, were
anesthetized with urethane (1.2 g/kg, i.p.). the depth of
anesthesia was monitored by observing responses to

rats were placed in a stereotaxic frame (david kopf,
tujunga, ca). an incision was made at the top of the head
to expose the dorsal neck muscles. the atlanto-occipital
membrane was exposed by using a spatula to remove the
dorsal neck muscles. a slit was made in the atlanto-occipital
membrane. the spinal catheter (pe-10) was inserted down
into the spinal subarachnoid space so that the tip was placed
in the vicinity of t1–t2 segment; the catheter was then
sutured to the top of the head. the position of the tubing
was visually verified at the end of the experiment. animals
in which the intrathecal tubing was misplaced inside the

spinal cord or outside the subarachnoid space were not used
for statistical analyses. rats were kept in a prone position
for the duration of the experiment.
2.4. chemicals and statistics
cartp and glutamate were dissolved in distilled,
deionized water and frozen in aliquots. before administration, peptides were thawed, dissolved in saline to the desired
concentration and injected intrathecally at a volume of 5 al,
which was followed by 5 al saline to wash in the agent.
cartp was from american peptide company (sunnyvale,
ca) and glutamate was from sigma (st. louis, mo).
cartp-antiserum (phoenix pharmaceuticals, belmont, ca)
or normal rabbit serum (vector laboratories, burlingame,
ca) was also injected in a volume of 5 al.
results were reported as percentage of maximal change
in map and hr relative to the control value elicited by
glutamate (1 nmol) administered prior to intrathecal
injection of cartp. data were analyzed statistically using
one factor anova followed by dunnett’s multiple comparison post test, with pb0.05 considered statistically
significant. results are expressed as meansfstandard error
of the mean (s.e.m.).

3. results
3.1. glutamate pressor and tachycardic effects
the map and hr were 116.1f6.4 mm hg and 309.6f
5.8 beats per minute (bpm) in urethane-anesthetized rats
(n=28). prior to every experiment, saline was given intrathecally as a negative control. intrathecal saline did not elicit
any significant changes in blood pressure and hr in the
majority of rats tested. animals in which saline produced
any cardiovascular responses were excluded for statistical
analyses, since that usually indicated the catheter was
positioned improperly in the spinal cord.
intrathecal glutamate (0.1–10 nmol), in agreement with
previous findings [14,28], caused a rise in map and hr.
representative tracings of intrathecal saline and glutamate
are shown in fig. 1. glutamate caused a dose dependent
increase in map and hr (fig. 2). hr responses to
glutamate developed rapidly and lasted 15–25 min depending on the concentration of glutamate. peak responses
occurred approximately 1–2 min after injection. injections
of saline or glutamate were given approximately 30 min
apart, permitting map and hr to recover to baseline. at a
given dose of glutamate, the increase in hr was proportionally larger as compared to blood pressure (fig. 2).
3.2. potentiation of glutamate response by cartp
in these experiments, glutamate (1 nmol) was first administered intrathecally to establish a control response.

(0.1–10 nmol) was administrated intrathecally to the t1–t2 spinal segment.

responses.

thirty minutes later, animals were pretreated with intrathecal saline or cartp (0.1–10 nmol) 5 min prior to a
subsequent administration of intrathecal glutamate (1
nmol). representative tracings of cardiovascular responses
elicited by glutamate before and after pretreatment with
either saline or different concentrations of cartp are shown
in fig. 3.
at lower concentrations, i.e., v1 nmol, intrathecal
cartp did not produce any noticeable effects on the heart
rate and mean arterial pressure. however, at doses of 5 and
10 nmol, slight pressor responses and tachycardia were
observed 1–2 min after administration. cartp increased
map by 0.75f0.75 (0.1), 1.8f1.8 (0.5), 1f1 (1), 3.3f3.3
(5) and 8.5f6.4 mm hg (10 nmol). the rises in map were
not statistically significant as compared to saline injection.
cartp increased hr by 0.5f0.5 (0.1), 2.4f1.4 (0.5),
6.3f3.8 (1), 7.5f2.5 (5) and 19f8.3 bpm (10 nmol). increases in hr were not statistically significant except at the
dose of 10 nmol.

was given every 30 min for 120 min. the effect of
cartp was long-lasting, as the glutamate responses remained elevated 90 min after administration of cartp
(fig. 5).
3.4. cartp antiserum or normal rabbit serum injection
cartp receptor antagonists are currently not available.
for this reason, cartp antiserum was used to evaluate the
specificity of the effects observed after cartp administration [22]. following a control response of glutamate (1
nmol) and cartp (1 nmol) plus glutamate (1 nmol),
cartp antiserum (1:500 dilution) was administrated intrathecally, which did not produce a significant change of
blood pressure or heart rate. thereafter, a second intrathecal
injection of cartp plus glutamate produced a pressor and
tachycardiac response, with a magnitude similar to that
produced by glutamate alone. the increase in blood
pressure and heart rate caused by cartp plus glutamate,

before treatment with either cartp or saline. saline (n=4), 0.1 nmol
cartp (n=4) and 0.5 nmol cartp (n=4) failed to produce any significant
changes in glutamate-induced increases in map and hr. cartp at 1 nmol
(n=4), 5 nmol (n=4) and 10 nmol (n=4) dose-dependently augmented the
pressor effect. cartp at 1 nmol (n=4) and 5 nmol (n=4) increased the
glutamate-induced tachycardia, whereas 10 nmol cartp (n=4) inhibited
glutamate-induced tachycardia. vertical bars are meansfs.e.m. asterisks

to the rat spinal cord, whereas saline had no effect (fig. 4).
cartp at 1, 5 and 10 nmol significantly increased the
pressor response to intrathecal glutamate. the maximum
increase of tachycardic response was seen from pretreatment
with 1 nmol cartp. at 5 nmol, the peptide significantly
augmented the chronotropic effect, but to a lesser extent
than 1 nmol cartp. the tachycardic effect induced by
glutamate was significantly lowered by a higher dose of
cartp (10 nmol).
3.3. long-lasting potentiation by cartp
in this series of experiments, the effect of intrathecal
cartp on pressor responses to glutamate was evaluated
over a 2-h period. control glutamate responses were
established prior to cartp administration. after pretreatment with cartp (0.5 or 2.5 nmol), intrathecal glutamate

saline or cartp injection served as the control. after rats were intrathecally
injected with cartp (0.5 and 2.5 nmol) or saline, glutamate was
administered intrathecally every 30 min for 120 min to assess persistence
of cartp activity. cartp at 0.5 nmol (n=4) and saline (n=4) did not
significantly augment pressor or positive chronotropic effect of glutamate.
however, 2.5 nmol cartp (n=4) enhanced the effects of glutamate.

and antiserum followed by cartp plus glutamate was
118f4% and 146f8%, and 96f4% and 103f6%, respectively (n=4). the response induced by glutamate (1 nmol)
was taken as 100%.

4. discussion
in vivo experiments were conducted to examine the
effects of cartp on spinal sympathetic outflow to the
vasculature and heart alone and in combination with
glutamate. our results indicate that cartp in lower
concentrations (b1 nmol), which administered alone elicits
little or no change of map and hr, significantly potentiates
the pressor response of glutamate injected intrathecally. the
peptide at higher concentrations (n10 nmol) by intrathecal
injection produces a modest increase of blood pressure and
heart rate.
in this and a previous study [14], intrathecal glutamate
(10 nmol–1 amol) raised arterial pressure and heart rate in
urethane-anesthetized sprague–dawley rats. it is worth
noting that the percent increase of heart rate was higher
than that of blood pressure following intrathecal glutamate.
this is probably due to the fact that the intrathecal catheter
was placed at the t1–t2, where the majority of sympathetic
preganglionic neurons project to the stellate ganglion and
middle cervical ganglion whose neurons innervate the heart,
as determined by anatomical tracing and functional studies
[2,21,24,26].
pretreatment with cartp (1–10 nmol) enhanced the
pressor response of a submaximal dose of glutamate (1
nmol). for example, cartp (10 nmol) increased the map
by 50f24 mm hg, which is 241f40% of the response
induced by glutamate alone. for heart rate, a maximal
potentiation was seen with 1 nmol cartp. while a
statistically significant increase of glutamate-induced tachycardia is evident with cartp (5 nmol), the increase is
smaller as compared to that induced by a lower dose of
cartp. at the dose of 10 nmol, the peptide attenuated the
glutamate-induced tachycardia as compared to that caused
by glutamate alone. it is possible that large pressor
responses caused subsequent activation of the baroreflex,
which consequently reduced the increase in hr. cartp
receptor antagonists are currently not available. we therefore evaluated the specificity of the response with the use of
cartp antiserum [22]. cartp antiserum was a rabbit
polyclonal, which exhibits 100% cross-reactivity with
cartp used in this study [10,11]. cart antiserum
administrated immediately before cartp plus glutamate
produced a pressor response that is comparable to that
caused by glutamate alone, indicating that the antiserum
neutralizes the effect of cartp. on the other hand, normal
rabbit serum caused little or no change of the pressor
response of cartp plus glutamate.
cartp by intrathecal administration exerted a long
lasting effect, as it continued to enhance glutamate-induced

responses for over 90 min after administration. another
interesting feature is that cartp at doses of 0.1–5 nmol by
itself did not elicit any significant cardiovascular responses,
whereas at the dose of 10 nmol it significantly increased the
hr as compared to saline injection. the potentiation of
glutamate-induced pressor response by cart is in many
respects similar to the enhancement of spinothalamic neuron
responses to chemical and mechanical stimuli following
combined micro-iontophoretic application of n-methyl-daspartic acid (nmda) and  xxxg2240xxx  [8]. in both cases,
putative transmitters act cooperatively to enhance the
physiological response. the mechanism whereby one transmitter enhances the response of another transmitter is
largely not known. it may interact at the receptor level or
at the signaling pathway. for example, pituitary adenylate
cyclase activating polypeptide enhances nmda currents
probably by elevating camp levels in rat sympathetic
preganglionic neurons [28].
cartp is present in a wide range of locations such as
the hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, intermediolateral cell column, vagal afferent fibers, adrenal medulla
and cardiac ganglia [3,4,10,11,16,17]. the peptide has been
implicated in a variety of functions within the central
nervous system. cartp increases anxiety-like behavior [5],
decreases feeding [1,23,27] and increases sympathetic
activity upon intracerebroventricular injection [20]. previously, we showed that cartp acts at the level of the
nucleus tractus solitarius to attenuate baroreflex in rats [22].
the present results indicate that cartp augments sympathetic outflow by acting on sympathetic preganglionic
neurons, supporting the contention that cartp may
mediate pathway specific aspects of cardiovascular function.
in summary, the sympathoexcitatory actions of cartp
were only slightly self-evident at doses of 5 and 10 nmol.
on the other hand, cartp (0.1–10 nmol) dose-dependently
augmented glutamate-induced increases in mean arterial
pressure and significantly increased chronotropic effects of
glutamate at moderate doses. at a higher dose (10 nmol),
glutamate-induced tachycardia was inhibited. the mechanisms involved are still unclear, as the putative cartp
receptor has not been characterized.
