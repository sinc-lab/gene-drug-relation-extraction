caudal-type homeobox 2 ( xxxg425xxx ) plays a key role in the exhibition of intestinal phenotypes by
regulating the expression of intestine-specific genes such as goblet-specific gene mucin 2
( xxxg1484xxx ). we investigated the involvement of the  xxxg1597xxx  (fxr), a nuclear
receptor for bile acids, in the chenodeoxycholic acid ( xxxd1660xxx )-induced expression of  xxxg425xxx  and
 xxxg1484xxx  in normal rat gastric epithelial cells (rgm-1 cells). rgm-1 cells were treated with
 xxxd1660xxx  or gw4064, an fxr agonist, in the presence or absence of guggulsterone, an fxr
antagonist.  xxxd1660xxx  induced dose-dependent expression of  xxxg425xxx  and  xxxg1484xxx  at both the mrna
and protein levels. the maximum stimulation of  xxxg425xxx  and  xxxg1484xxx  mrna induced by  xxxd1660xxx 
was observed at 3 h and by 6 h, respectively. gw4064 also induced expression of these
molecules. the effects of  xxxd1660xxx  and gw4064 on expression of  xxxg425xxx  and  xxxg1484xxx  were abolished
by guggulsterone. these findings suggest that bile acids may induce gastric intestinal metaplasia
and carcinogenesis through the fxr.

caudal-type homeobox 2 ( xxxg425xxx ), a mammalian member
of the caudal-related homeobox gene family, plays an
important role in the differentiation of intestinal cells and in
maintaining the intestinal phenotype by binding to the promoters of several intestine-specific genes including gobletspecific gene mucin 2 ( xxxg1484xxx ) [4, 5]. mizoshita et al. [6]
reported that  xxxg425xxx  mrna was widely present in human
intestinal and colonic mucosa, but not in normal gastric
mucosa. however, the nuclear expression of  xxxg425xxx  has been
reported in gastric mucosa associated with intestinal metaplasia, as well as in relation to intestinal-type gastric carcinomas [7, 8]. furthermore,  xxxg425xxx  transgenic mice developed
intestinal metaplasia in the stomach with the induction of
 xxxg1484xxx  [9, 10], suggesting that ectopically expressed  xxxg425xxx 
may play a key role in gastric carcinogenesis via induction
of intestinal metaplasia.

introduction
a high incidence of gastric cancer is known to occur in
asia and is one of the leading causes of cancer-related
deaths worldwide. although the precise mechanism that
underlies gastric carcinogenesis is not yet fully understood,
gastric carcino genesis, particularly the intestinal-type, is
thought to be a multistep process triggered by chronic
helicobacter pylori infections. atrophic gastritis, intestinal
metaplasia and dysplasia represent different stages of the
gastric carcinogenesis cascade and intestinal type gastric
cancers are thought to develop within the gastric mucosa

clinical and experimental studies showed that the reflux
of bile into the stomach and esophagus contributes to the
induction of intestinal metaplasia of the stomach and gastric
carcinogenesis [11, 12], as well as to esophageal injury,
barrett’s esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma [13, 14].
furthermore, hu et al. [15] demonstrated that deoxycholic
acid caused the upregulation of  xxxg425xxx  and  xxxg1484xxx  mrna
using four human esophageal cell lines, including those derived from normal squamous, adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma tissues. the mechanisms associated with
the bile acid induced expression of these molecules, however, remains unclear.
bile acids are physiological ligands and activators of the
 xxxg1597xxx  (fxr), a transcription factor belonging
to the nuclear receptor superfamily [16–18]. bile acids have
been shown to exert signaling activities associated with the
self-modulation of genes involved in their own synthesis and
transport through the activation of the fxr [19].
in this study, we investigated whether two primary bile
acids, chenodeoxycholic acid ( xxxd1660xxx ) and secondary bile
acid,  xxxd1835xxx  (dca), could induce the expression
of  xxxg425xxx  and  xxxg1484xxx  in normal rat gastric epithelial cells. we
also evaluated the involvement of the fxr in the cdcainduced ectopic expression of these molecules.

materials and methods
cell culture and reagents
normal rat gastric epithelial cells, rgm-1 cells, established by hirofumi matsui (riken cell bank, tsukuba,
japan), were cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem)/f12 ham (sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo)
supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (fbs) at 37°c in
an humidified 95% air, 5% co2 atmosphere. the cells were
seeded in 100 mm dishes and were routinely grown in
dmem/f12 supplemented with 20% fbs. once the cells
reached 70% confluency, they were serum-deprived for
24 h. the cells were then treated with  xxxd1660xxx  (0–50 µm),
100 µm dca, or 5 nm gw4064 (an fxr agonist) in the
presence or absence of 50 µm guggulsterone (an fxr
antagonist).  xxxd1660xxx , dca, and guggulsterone were purchased
from sigma-aldrich and gw4064 was purchased from tocris
bioscience (ellisville, mo). they were dissolved in dmso.
real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase
chain reaction (rt-pcr)
real-time quantitative rt-pcr analyses were performed
as previously described [20]. in brief, an isogen kit
(nippon gene, tokyo, japan) was used to isolate total rna
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. quantitative rtpcr analyses were performed using an abi prism 7700
sequence detection system and accompanying software
(pe applied biosystems, foster city, ca). the reaction

mixture was prepared according to the manufacturer’s
protocol using the platinum qrt-pcr thermoscript onestep system from invitrogen (carlsbad, ca). the thermal
cycling conditions were 50°c for 30 min and 95°c for
5 min, followed by 45 cycles of amplification using 95°c for
15 s and 60°c for 1 min. total rna was subjected to
quantitative rt-pcr to assess the levels of the targeted gene
sequences.  xxxg861xxx  served as an internal standard using
taqman  xxxg861xxx  control reagents purchased from pe
applied biosystems. the expression of  xxxg425xxx  and  xxxg1484xxx 
mrna was standardized against  xxxg861xxx  mrna, and the
mrna levels were expressed as ratios compared to the
mean value obtained for vehicle (dmso)-treated cells.
specific probe sets for  xxxg425xxx ,  xxxg1484xxx  and  xxxg861xxx  were also
obtained from pe applied biosystems.
western blotting
rgm-1 cells were routinely cultured and lysed on ice
after harvesting in a lysis buffer containing 0.5% np-40,
40 mm tris hcl (ph 8.0), 120 mm nacl and a protease
inhibitor cocktail (complete mini, pierce, rockford, il).
the protein concentration of the lysate was measured using
a modified bicinchoninic acid method (pierce). the proteins
were denatured with sds sample buffer and subjected to
sds-page. the separated proteins were then transferred
onto an immun-blot pvdf membrane (bio-rad laboratories, hercules, ca). the membranes were blocked in
tbs-t buffer (10 mm tris hcl, ph 7.5, 100 mm nacl,
0.1% tween-20) containing 5% skim-milk and these were
then incubated in a 1:250 dilution of a mouse anti- xxxg425xxx  or a
rabbit anti- xxxg1484xxx  antibody (both from santa cruz biotechnology, inc., santa cruz, ca) overnight at 4°c. subsequently,
the membranes were washed in tbs and incubated with the
appropriate hrp-conjugated secondary antibody before
washing again in tbs. the reactive bands were visualized
using enhanced chemiluminescence (amersham, arlington
heights, il) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
immunofluorescence
rgm-1 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for
20 min and fixed with cold acetone for 5 min. the cells were
immunostained using a primary rabbit polyclonal anti-fxr
antibody (1:100 dilution; santa cruz biotechnology, inc.)
followed by a secondary donkey anti-rabbit igg antibody
conjugated to alexa fluor-488 (1:200 dilution; invitrogen).
then slides were then examined using a nikon epifluorescence microscope (tokyo, japan).
statistical analysis
values are the means ± standard deviation. a one-way
analysis of variance was used to test for significant differences among the treatment group means, and results were

considered significant.

results and discussion
effect of  xxxd1660xxx  on the expression of  xxxg425xxx  and  xxxg1484xxx  in
rgm-1 cells
 xxxd1660xxx  (0 to 50 µm) increased the expression level of
 xxxg425xxx  and  xxxg1484xxx  mrna in a dose-dependent fashion
(fig. 1a and b). therefore, we used  xxxd1660xxx  at a dose of
50 µm in this study. a dose-dependent upregulation of  xxxg425xxx 
and  xxxg1484xxx  protein expression by  xxxd1660xxx  was also observed
as assessed by western blotting (fig. 1c and d).
the maximum effect of  xxxd1660xxx  on the mrna expression
levels observed for  xxxg425xxx  and  xxxg1484xxx  occurred at 3 h and 6 h,
respectively (fig. 2a and b). because  xxxd1660xxx  did not affect
 xxxg1484xxx  mrna expression by 3 h, we suspect that the increase
in  xxxg425xxx  expression induced by  xxxd1660xxx  may be related to the
upregulation of  xxxg1484xxx  expression in rgm-1 cells.
we also investigated the effect of dca on  xxxg425xxx  expression in rgm-1 cells. similar to  xxxd1660xxx , dca induced  xxxg425xxx 
expression at both mrna and protein levels (fig. 3a and b).
to investigate the mechanism by which bile acids might
induce intestinal metaplasia in the stomach, we performed
in vitro studies using normal gastric cells (rgm-1 cells),
instead of gastric cancer cells. we observed that  xxxd1660xxx 
markedly upregulated the expression of both  xxxg425xxx  and
 xxxg1484xxx . together with the finding that dca also induced

 xxxg425xxx  expression in rgm-1 cells, these results suggest that
bile acids likely cause gastric intestinal metaplasia by
inducing the ectopic expression of  xxxg425xxx  in normal epithelial
cells.
expression of the fxr in rgm-1 cells
during normal physiological conditions, the expression of
the fxr is generally thought to be limited to the liver,
intestine, kidney and adrenal glands [21, 22]. zhang et al.,
[23] however, reported that the fxr is also expressed in
the stomach. but because there are few reports documenting
the expression of the fxr in the stomach, we investigated
whether rgm-1 cells expressed the fxr. as shown in
fig. 4, immunofluorescence staining clearly demonstrated the
nuclear localization of the fxr in these cells.
involvement of the fxr in the  xxxd1660xxx -induced upregulation
of  xxxg425xxx  and  xxxg1484xxx 
next, we investigated the effect of guggulsterone, an fxr
antagonist, on the expression of  xxxg425xxx  and  xxxg1484xxx  in rgm-1
cells stimulated by  xxxd1660xxx . as shown in fig. 5a and b, the
effect of  xxxd1660xxx  stimulation on the expression of  xxxg425xxx  and
 xxxg1484xxx  mrna was completely abolished by guggulsterone.

expression of the fxr in rgm-1 cells. the expression
of the fxr was assessed by immunofluorescence.

guggulsterone alone did not affect the expression levels of
these molecules.
to confirm involvement of the fxr in upregulating the
expression of  xxxg425xxx  and  xxxg1484xxx , rgm-1 cells were stimulated with gw4064, an fxr agonist. as expected, gw4064
increased the expression of  xxxg425xxx  and  xxxg1484xxx  mrna by
4.9-fold and 5.5-fold, respectively (fig. 5c and d). the
effect of gw4064 on the expression of these molecules
was also abolished by guggulsterone. these results suggest
that the activation of the fxr may cause the ectopic expression of  xxxg425xxx  and  xxxg1484xxx  in the gastric mucosa, and that
 xxxd1660xxx  may be a potent activator of the fxr in the stomach.
while the main function of the fxr is to prevent intracellular bile acid overload and toxicity by acting as a bile
acid sensor that stimulates bile acid export and absorption
[16–18], other studies suggested that the fxr performs a
pro-inflammatory role in the liver [24] and esophagus [25].
we demonstrated that the fxr directly upregulates the
expression of  xxxg425xxx  for the first time. our findings suggest
that the fxr may be a key molecule involved in the intestinal
metaplasia of the stomach. bile acid reflux into the stomach
may therefore, cause gastric carcinogenesis by activating the
fxr, a nuclear  xxxg1597xxx .
the activation of  xxxg681xxx  receptors
(egfr) is also important for gastric intestinal carcinogenesis [26] and several reports suggest that bile acids
activate egfr in gastrointestinal cells [27, 28]. yasuda et al.
[29] reported that  xxxd1835xxx  rapidly activated egfr
through a membrane-type  xxxg1597xxx -dependent
mechanism in ags cells, a human gastric adenocarcinoma
cell line. these results suggest that bile acids may promote
gastric carcinogenesis through the activation of both nuclear
and membrane receptors.
in conclusion, bile acids may induce an ectopic expresj. clin. biochem. nutr.

effect of fxr agonists on the expression of  xxxg425xxx  and  xxxg1484xxx  in the presence or absence of guggulsterone, an fxr antagonist.
rgm-1 cells were treated with fxr agonists (50 µm  xxxd1660xxx  and gw4064) in the presence or absence of guggulsterone, an
fxr antagonist, for 3 h or 6 h and the levels of  xxxg425xxx  (a and c) or  xxxg1484xxx  (b and d) were examined. n = 3. * p<0.05 compared
with controls (vehicle-treated group), # p<0.01 compared with  xxxd1660xxx  group (a and b) or gw4064 group (c and d).

sion of  xxxg425xxx  and  xxxg1484xxx  by activating the fxr in gastric
epithelial cells. this activation may play an important role in
the induction of intestinal metaplasia and gastric carcinogenesis by bile acids.
