abstract
using radioligand binding assays and post-mortem normal human brain tissue, we obtained equilibrium dissociation constants (kds) for nine new antipsychotic drugs ( xxxd2330xxx , melperone, olanzapine, org 5222, quetiapine,  xxxd3129xxx ,  xxxd3195xxx , ziprasidone, and zotepine), one metabolite of a
new drug ( xxxd2830xxx ), and three older antipsychotics (clozapine, haloperidol, and  xxxd2956xxx ) at
nine different receptors (a1-adrenergic, a2-adrenergic, dopamine d2, histamine h1, muscarinic, and serotonin 5-ht1a,  xxxg1110xxx , 5-ht2a, and 5-ht2c receptors).  xxxd2330xxx  was the most potent drug at the
two adrenergic receptors. org 5222 was the most potent drug at dopamine d2 and 5-ht2c receptors,
while ziprasidone was the most potent compound at three serotonergic receptors (5-ht1a,  xxxg1110xxx , and
5-ht2a). at the remaining two receptors, olanzapine was the most potent drug at the  xxxg1078xxx  (kd50.087 nm); clozapine at the muscarinic receptor (kd59 nm). certain therapeutic and adverse effects, as well as certain drug interactions can be predicted from a drug’s potency for blocking a
specific receptor. these data can provide guidelines for the clinician in the choice of antipsychotic
drug. © 2000 elsevier science inc. all rights reserved.

introduction
antipsychotic drugs are antagonists of many neurotransmitter receptors in human brain
[1–3]. the potency of this blockade can be used to predict the likelihood of adverse side effects and drug interactions in clinical practice [4]. in addition, relative affinities for dopamine
d2 and serotonin 5-ht2a receptors may predict whether an antipsychotic drug is atypical [5].

figure 1. structures of some new antipsychotic drugs.

since we last reported the results of this type of study, several new antipsychotic drugs
have been approved for use in the united states or are close to being approved. among those
are  xxxd2330xxx , olanzapine, org 5222, and ziprasidone (fig. 1). along with clozapine, these
drugs have been classified as atypical neuroleptics, a term that refers to their propensity to
have a low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects. in addition, although others have studied
these compounds at brain receptors [6], none has used human brain as the source of receptors. therefore, we wanted to find the binding potencies of these and some additional compounds at several different receptors in human brain. thus, we evaluated twelve antipsychotic drugs and a metabolite of one at a1-adrenergic, a2-adrenergic, dopamine d2, histamine
h1, muscarinic, and serotonin 5-ht1a,  xxxg1110xxx , 5-ht2a, and 5-ht2c receptors.
methods and materials
tissue preparation
normal brain tissue was obtained at the time of autopsy and stored at 280 8c until it was
homogenized in 10 volumes of ice-cold 50 mm nakpo4 buffer, ph 5 7.4, using a brinkmann homogenizer, model pt 10/30 (10 sec, setting 6). the homogenate was then spun at
38 000 g for 10 min in a beckman model j2-21 centrifuge. the pellets were resuspended in
fresh nakpo4 buffer and centrifuged again at 38 000 g. the final pellets were resuspended
in nakpo4 and diluted to a concentration of 10 mg wet weight per ml and stored at 280 8c
until just before assay. for use in the radioligand binding assay, adequate amounts of tissue
homogenates were thawed and spun as before. the pellets were washed and resuspended in
fresh 50 mm tris-hcl buffer. the volume for the resuspension varied with the receptor being

studied to provide the final tissue concentration indicated in table 1. for  xxxg1108xxx  assays the
tissue homogenate of human cortex was processed further as described before [7]. for  xxxg1110xxx 
assays, human substantia nigra tissue homogenates were prepared further as previously described [8]. for 5ht2c assays, the tissue homogenate for human frontal cortex was processed
further into microsomal fractions as previously described [9].
radioligand binding assays
assays were done on the beckman biomek 1000 workstation outfitted with a side arm
loader [10]. nine different receptors were studied using modifications of previously reported
methods [1,2,8,11–13]. table 1 lists the radioligands and conditions for the different receptors. the incubation conditions for the  xxxg1108xxx  and 5ht2c receptors were 30 min at 37 8c,
while the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor was 60 min at 25 8c. all other assays were incubated at 37 8c for
60 min. after incubation the samples were filtered under vacuum onto wallac betaplate a filter mats using a tomtec harvester 96. the tubes and filters were rinsed with 4 3 2 ml icecold 0.9% nacl. the filters were then counted using a wallac betaplate 1205 scintillation
counter. specific binding to the receptor was calculated as the difference between the total
binding (zero unlabeled ligand) and nonspecific binding (excess unlabeled ligand).
data analysis
the data were analyzed using the ligand program [14] to calculate equilibrium dissociation constants (kd). the program has been modified by us to provide the hill coefficient.
geometric mean of the kd [15] and its standard error [16] were calculated. unless noted otherwise, we present mean values from at least three independent experiments, each done in duplicate.

chemical co., inc., somerville, nj, usa); quinuclidinylbenzilate (qnb) and spiperone (research biochemicals inc., natick, ma. usa).

results
the data for the equilibrium dissociation constants for antipsychotic drugs at nine different
receptors are presented in table 2. the compounds are presented alphabetically. reference
compounds are also presented at the bottom of this table. hill coefficients for all compounds
at all receptors were essentially equal to unity, showing that binding of these drugs obeyed
the law of mass action.
 xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenoceptor
to study the a1-adrenoceptor, we used the radioligand [3h] xxxd3000xxx , which had a kd 5
0.28 6 0.01 nm (n536).the neuroleptics with the most potent binding at this receptor were
 xxxd2330xxx  and org 5222 with kd’s of 0.31 and 1.1 nm, respectively (table 2).  xxxd2956xxx 
and melperone were the least potent competitive antagonists at this receptor (table 2).
 xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor
the radioligand, [3h]rauwolscine, which was the most potent compound tested, had a
kd52.560.1 nm (n528). antipsychotics competitively antagonized this radioligand.  xxxd2330xxx  was the most potent compound at the a2-adrenoceptor (kd 5 3.0 nm), with  xxxd3129xxx  (kd 5 8 nm) being the next most potent (table 2). the metabolite of  xxxd3129xxx ,
 xxxd2830xxx , had one-tenth the affinity of its parent compound for this receptor.
 xxxg656xxx 
using the human caudate nucleus, we found that [3h]spiperone had a kd 5 0.2860.02 nm
(n519). spiperone was the most potent antipsychotic drug tested by about 7 fold, with org
5222 being next most potent (kd52.0 nm. quetiapine was the least potent compound studied
(kd 5 770 nm).

 xxxg1078xxx 
we used [ xxxd3050xxx  to study the  xxxg1078xxx  of human brain frontal cortex.
for  xxxd3050xxx  ( xxxd3050xxx ) its kd found in 35 independent experiments was 2.560.1 nm.
by far the most potent compound was olanzapine, with kd 5 87 pm. in fact, olanzapine was
the most potent compound that we have tested at the histamine h1 of any class of compounds [11].
muscarinic receptor
for studying the muscarinic receptor, we used the human caudate nucleus and the radioligand [3h]quinuclidinyl benzilate (kd 5 0.17 nm, n 5 18). qnb is a non-selective muscarinic antagonist, having about equal affinity for the five subtypes of muscarinic receptors [17].
as observed previously by us and others [1,18,19], clozapine was the most with kd 5 9 nm.
the next most potent was olanzapine, which is structurally very similar to clozapine.
 xxxg1108xxx  receptor
for this receptor the radioligand chosen was [3h]8-hydroxy-dpat. this compound was
the most potent with a kd 5 0.3660.02 nm (n524). [3h]8-hyrdoxy-dpat was competitively
antagonized by antipsychotics, with ziprasidone being the most potent, having a kd (1.9 nm)
similar to that of the anxiolytic buspirone (kd53.8 nm) [20]. ziprasidone may be a partial
agonist at this receptor, based on studies with the recombinant human receptor expressed in
chinese hamster ovary cells [21].
 xxxg1110xxx  receptor
for this receptor we used as the radioligand [3h]5-carboxamidotryptamine ([3h]5-ct).
this compound was the most potent at this receptor with a kd 5 0.3260.02 nm (n58).
[3h]5-ct was competitively antagonized by antipsychotics, with ziprasidone again being the
most potent (kd 52.4 nm).  xxxd3129xxx  was nearly as potent, with a kd 53.9 nm.
5ht2a receptor
the 5ht2a receptor antagonist [3h] xxxd2419xxx  had a kd 5 2.660.1 nm (n 5 29). [3h] xxxd2419xxx  was competitively antagonized by antipsychotics, with ziprasidone again being the
most potent with a kd (0.12 nm) more than 20 fold lower than that of  xxxd2419xxx . however,
the affinities of  xxxd3195xxx  and  xxxd3129xxx  at this receptor were nearly identical to that of
ziprasidone (table 2).
5ht2c receptor
for this receptor we used as the radioligand [3h]serotonin, which had a kd 52.960.2 nm
(n514). [3h]serotonin was competitively antagonized by antipsychotics, with org 5222 being the most potent (kd 50.27 nm). the next most potent was ziprasidone, with 3 fold lower
affinity at this receptor (kd 50.9 nm) than that of org 5222.

discussion
in this study we obtained data for a series of antipsychotic drugs and one metabolite of one
of these compounds at nine different receptor types in human brain tissue. these receptors
included the a1- and a2-adrenergic, dopamine d2, histamine h1, muscarinic acetylcholine,
and serotonin 5-ht1a,  xxxg1110xxx , 5-ht2a, and 5-ht2c receptors. we previously reported results
for two of these antipsychotic drugs at some of these receptors [1,2]. our results from the
present study compare well with those from the earlier studies, except for three values. the
present results showed clozapine to be more potent at the a2-adrenergic and serotonin 5-ht1a
receptors, and haloperidol to be more potent at the  xxxg1078xxx  than we previously
reported. we do not know the reason for these differences. however, our present kd’s for
clozapine are more consistent with results from other laboratories for the a2-adrenergic [22]
and serotonin 5-ht1a receptors [23].
additionally, schotte et al. [6] obtained inhibitor constants for 10 compounds and 6
human receptors in common with our study. for the  xxxg1115xxx  (formerly named the
 xxxg1115xxx  receptor), we compared the data for rat receptor from roth et al.[24], who had just
5 compounds in common with our study. however, in all this other work, molecularly cloned
human (or rat) receptors expressed in cells were the source of the membranal preparations.
we did a linear regression analysis of the log of our data versus the log of their data for the
drugs and receptors in common. for the schotte et al. data, all correlations were significant,
with the rank order for the level of significance as follows: d2 (versus the average of their
d2s and d2l data, r50.99, p,0.0001).  xxxg1110xxx  (versus their 5- xxxg1110xxx  data, r50.92,
p50.0001).5-ht2a (r50.90, p50.0004)55-ht1a (r50.90, p50004).a2-adrenoceptors
(r50.85, p50.002 vs.a2c-adrenoceptors; r50.75, p50.012 vs.a2a-adrenoceptors; and
r50.69, p50.027 vs. a2b-adrenoceptors).histamine h1 (r50.65, p50.043). for the roth
et al. data with the inclusion of  xxxd2956xxx , which was much weaker in their studies, r50.89,
p50.044. however, without  xxxd2956xxx , r50.999, p50.0004. these results validate our work
and theirs. particularly important is the correlation with the 5-ht2c data. this is because we
used [3h]5-ht as the radioligand in the frontal cortex, where many other types of 5-ht receptors exist.
with the molecularly cloned receptors experiments are more readily performed. in addition, except for the possibility of the presence of endogenously expressed receptors in the
host cells, one can be more certain of the specificity of binding of a radioligand when working with the cloned receptors, than when working with homogenates of human brain tissue.
on the other hand, there exists the possibility, due to differences in post-translational processing of proteins or the coupling of receptors to components of the membrane, that binding
characteristics with cloned receptors are different from those for the endogenous receptors.
our analysis seems to suggest otherwise, however.
all the drugs studied, except haloperidol, are presently classified as atypical neuroleptics.
on clinical criteria [5], an atypical neuroleptic has antipsychotic efficacy, with minimal extrapyramidal side effects, and does not cause tardive dyskinesia. in the absence of long term
data, which would answer the question about tardive dyskinesia, another criterion to define
an atypical neuroleptic would be that it causes a small elevation of serum prolactin levels (although  xxxd3129xxx , which is classified as atypical, produces relatively large increases in serum

prolactin levels [25]). because of the apparent efficacy of clozapine for treating the negative
signs and symptoms (e.g., social withdrawal, flattened affect) of schizophrenia [26], the additional criterion of efficacy in treating the negative features of schizophrenia is sometimes
added to the definition of an atypical neuroleptic. however, not all studies show a robust effect
of clozapine in treating these negative features [27,28]. in the early stages of drug development, when little or no clinical data are available, preclinical studies showing no or weak potential to cause catalepsy is also a criterion to classify an antipsychotic drug as atypical [29].
in the past fifteen years, several basic research findings have provided hypotheses about what
makes a neuroleptic atypical. this research includes radioligand binding studies of antipsychotic drugs at dopamine, serotonin [29–32], and muscarinic [17] receptors, second messenger
synthesis at muscarinic receptors [33,34], and electrophysiological studies with rats treated
chronically with drugs [35,36]. from this basic research comes the reasonable conclusion
that no single hypothesis explains why a particular drug behaves as an atypical antipsychotic.
that is, a drug may be an atypical antipsychotic drug by having one (or more) of several
different properties. these include agonism at dopamine d1 receptors [37] and muscarinic
m4 receptors [33,34]; antagonism at a2-adrenoceptors [38], as well as at dopamine d4 [30],
serotonin  xxxg1119xxx  [32,39], and serotonin 5-ht7 [39] receptors. however, particular interest has
been given to the relative affinity of a drug for serotonin 5-ht2a receptors compared to that
for dopamine d2 receptors [29,40]. specifically, many drugs behave as atypical neuroleptics,
when the ratio of the log of their affinity (1/kd) for the  xxxg1113xxx  to that for the  xxxg656xxx  is greater than1. for the antipsychotic drugs listed in table 2, this criterion is
met for all drugs except the typical neuroleptic haloperidol. among the atypical compounds,
the highest ratio is for clozapine (1.29) and the lowest is for melperone (1.04).
additionally, receptor blockade by antipsychotic drugs may be of further clinical relevance, since some drugs that potently block these receptors may cause certain adverse effects
and potential drug interactions in patients [4]. table 3 lists the possible clinical relevance
of blocking many of these receptors. for example,  xxxg1078xxx  blockade may
cause somnolence and stimulation of appetite, which can lead to weight gain. olanzapine,
which is a drug with the highest affinity of any we have studied at this receptor, frequently
causes these side effects in patients [41]. therefore, clinicians can use these receptor binding
data to minimize or avoid certain adverse effects and certain drug interactions in their patients (table 3).
