ne of the ways that the innate immune system recognizes
pathogens is through tlrs. specifically, tlrs recognize
structurally conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as lps and cpg containing bacterial dna. there are at
least 10 known human tlrs. all tlrs are type i integral membrane
proteins with extracellular leucine-rich regions and intracellular regions that are homologous to the  xxxg1171xxx  signaling toll  xxxg1171xxx  domain
(1, 2). to date, all tlrs are linked to an adaptor protein, such as
 xxxg1489xxx , toll  xxxg1171xxx  adaptor protein, toll  xxxg1171xxx  domain-containing
adaptor protein inducing ifn-␤, and toll  xxxg1171xxx  domain-containing
adaptor protein inducing ifn-␤-related adaptor molecule (3–7). activation of tlrs results in downstream activation of nf-␬b and other
transcription factors, culminating in transcription of numerous genes,
including cytokines, chemokines, and costimulatory markers (8).
although innate immune cells express the highest levels of
tlrs, their mrna expression profile differs from one cell type to
another. for instance, human blood-derived myeloid dendritic
cells (mdc)3 express tlr2, -3, -4, and -5, whereas plasmacytoid
dc (pdc) express  xxxg2293xxx  (9 –12). consistent with these mrna
expression patterns, myeloid blood dc produce cytokines in re3m pharmaceuticals, st. paul, mn 55144

sponse to their respective ligands, such as peptidoglycan and lipopeptides (tlr2),  xxxd557xxx :c ( xxxg2289xxx ), lps (tlr4), and flagellin
(tlr5), but do not respond to cpg dna ( xxxg2293xxx ). conversely,
pdc produce cytokines in response to cpg dna, but do not respond to pgn,  xxxd557xxx :c, lps, or flagellin (13–18). therefore, one
can evaluate the specificity of tlr agonists using specific populations of cells with defined tlr expression patterns.
natural agonists for the tlrs have been identified for some, but
not all, tlrs. natural agonists for tlr2,  xxxg2289xxx , tlr4, tlr5,
tlr2/6, and  xxxg2293xxx  include peptidylglycan, dsrna ( xxxd557xxx :c), lps,
flagellin, macrophage-activating lipopeptide 2, and bacterial dnacontaining cpg motifs, respectively. natural agonists for  xxxg2291xxx  and
 xxxg2292xxx  have recently been identified as guanosine- and uridine-rich
ssrna (19, 20). in addition, synthetic imidazoquinoline-like molecules,  xxxd2339xxx  ( xxxd2339xxx ), resiquimod (r-848), s-27609, and
guanosine analogues such as loxoribine have been shown to activate
nf-␬b through  xxxg2291xxx , whereas resiquimod also activates nf-␬b
through  xxxg2292xxx . both  xxxd2339xxx  and resiquimod have been identified
as  xxxg2291xxx  agonists based on their inability to induce dc maturation or
tnf-␣, il-12, or ifn-␣ production in  xxxg2291xxx -deficient mice. additionally,  xxxd2339xxx  and resiquimod induce nf-␬b activation in
hek293 cells transfected with human or mouse  xxxg2291xxx  (21, 22). resiquimod has also been identified as a  xxxg2292xxx  agonist based on its ability
to activate nf-␬b in hek293 cells transfected with human, but not
mouse,  xxxg2292xxx  (23). therefore,  xxxd2339xxx  and resiquimod can tentatively be defined as human  xxxg2291xxx  or  xxxg2291xxx /8 agonists, respectively.
in this study we first identified small molecules that were selective for human  xxxg2291xxx  or human  xxxg2292xxx . then we evaluated their
effects on several primary human innate immune cells. despite the
phylogenetic and structural similarities between  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx ,
we found that activation of  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  by these new agonists
has distinct consequences on the innate immune cells.

although  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  are phylogenetically and structurally related, their relative functions are largely unknown. the role
of  xxxg2291xxx  has been established using  xxxg2291xxx -deficient mice and small molecule  xxxg2291xxx  agonists. the absence of  xxxg2292xxx -selective
agonists has hampered our understanding of the role of  xxxg2292xxx . in this study tlr agonists selective for  xxxg2291xxx  or  xxxg2292xxx  were used
to determine the repertoire of human innate immune cells that are activated through these tlrs. we found that  xxxg2291xxx  agonists
directly activated purified plasmacytoid dendritic cells and, to a lesser extent, monocytes. conversely,  xxxg2292xxx  agonists directly
activated purified myeloid dendritic cells, monocytes, and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (gm-csf/il-4/tgf-␤). accordingly,
 xxxg2291xxx -selective agonists were more effective than  xxxg2292xxx -selective agonists at inducing ifn-␣- and ifn-regulated chemokines such
as ifn-inducible protein and ifn-inducible t cell ␣ chemoattractant from human pbmc. in contrast,  xxxg2292xxx  agonists were more
effective than  xxxg2291xxx  agonists at inducing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as tnf-␣, il-12, and mip-1␣. thus,
this study demonstrated that  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  agonists differ in their target cell selectivity and cytokine induction profile. the

captured the immune complexes. the plate was then put into an igen m8
workstation (bioveris), where the cytokine levels in the culture supernatant were determined by measuring the light emitted from ori-tag-labeled secondary ab. the ori-tag labels based on ruthenium tris-bipyridyl chemistry were used, producing light after being stimulated with an
electrical potential. the intensity of light emitted from the ori-tag-labeled cytokine was directly proportional to the cytokine concentration in
the sample.
tnf-␣ (ahc3419 and ahc3712) and il-12p40/70 (ahc7129 and
ahc8122) ab pairs were obtained from biosource international. abs
ahc3419 (anti-tnf-␣) and ahc7129 (anti-il-12) were biotin labeled.
abs ahc3712 (anti-tnf-␣) and ahc8122 (anti-il-12) were ori-tag
labeled. the assay was performed by first incubating the biotin-labeled abs
with m-280 streptavidin dynabeads (dynal biotech). then, tissue culture
supernatants, biotin-labeled ab/streptavidin beads, and ori-tag-labeled
abs were coincubated in 96-well microtiter plates for 2.5 h at room temperature. the plates were read using the igen m8 workstation, and the
data were analyzed with softmax pro software (molecular devices). standard curves for tnf-␣ and il-12p40/70 were generated using rtnf-␣
(210-ta; r&d systems) and ril-12p70 (219-il; r&d systems), respectively. the minimum level of detection for the tnf-␣ and il-12p40/70
origen assays is 40 pg/ml.
ifn-␣ protein levels were measured from tissue culture supernatants
using the multispecies ifn-␣ elisa (peska biomedical laboratories).

transfection and reporter assay
transient transfections were performed as previously described with some
modifications (24). the day before transfection, hek293 cells (crl-1573;
american type culture collection) were seeded in six-well plates (bd
biosciences) at 4 ⫻ 105 cell/well in dmem supplemented with 0.1 mm
nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fcs and incubated at 37°c
in 5% co2. the cells were cotransfected with 1 ␮g of human  xxxg2291xxx  or
human  xxxg2292xxx  along with 0.1 ␮g of nf-␬b-luciferase reporter (bd clontech) in a 10:1 ratio with 3 ␮l of fugene 6 transfection reagent (roche)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. the plates were incubated 24 h
after transfection and then stimulated with various concentrations of small
molecule tlr agonists. the plates were then incubated an additional 15 h
at 37°c in 5% co2. nf-␬b activation was determined by lysing the transfected hek293 cells with reporter lysis buffer (steadylite hts;
perkinelmer), and the lysate was assayed for luciferase activity using a
lmax luminometer (molecular devices). nf-␬b activation is directly
proportional to relative luciferase units.

preparation of primary human cells
whole blood anticoagulated with edta was obtained from healthy volunteers that had provided informed consent before donation (institutional
review board no. 96-046). pbmc were isolated by density gradient centrifugation using histopaque 1077 (sigma-aldrich) as recommended by
the manufacturer. the mononuclear cells were washed twice with hbss
(celox) and resuspended in crpmi (rpmi 1640, 25 mm hepes, sodium
bicarbonate, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1 mm l-glutamine, 1% penicillin/
streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fcs (biosource international)).
pbmc were cultured at 2 ⫻ 106/ml in 0.25 ml in 96-well plates or in 0.5
ml 48 well, flat-bottom plates.
plasmacytoid dc, mdc, and monocytes were isolated from pbmc by
immunomagnetic bead positive selection using bdca-4, bdca-1, and
cd14, respectively, according to manufacturer’s recommendations.
briefly, pbmc were incubated with immunomagnetic microbeads, and the
labeled cells were collected with miltenyi ls or ld columns (25). the
positively selected cells were resuspended in crpmi and cultured at 1 ⫻
106 cells/ml in 0.25 ml in 96-well, flat-bottom plates. in some experiments
pdc and monocytes were depleted using bdca-4 and cd14 immunomagnetic beads, respectively. the remaining pbmc population was cultured at 2 ⫻ 106 cells/ml in 0.2 ml in 96-well, flat-bottom plates. cell purity
from positively isolated cells and populations of cells was determined by
flow cytometry.

determination of secreted cytokines and chemokines
tnf-␣ and il-12p40/70 protein levels were measured from tissue culture
supernatants by origen (igen) assays (bioveris), a sandwich-type immune assay based on electrochemiluminescence. cytokine-specific ab was
mixed with tissue culture supernatants in 96-well plates. a biotin-labeled,
cytokine-specific ab captured the cytokine, and an ori-tag (bv-tag)labeled secondary ab was used for detection. streptavidin-coated beads

cells cultured at 4 ⫻ 105 cells/well in 3 ml were cotransfected with human
 xxxg2291xxx  or human  xxxg2292xxx  and an nf-␬b-luciferase reporter construct. after
18 –24 h, the cells were stimulated with various concentrations of four
small molecule imidazoquinolines (3m-001, 3m-002, 3m-003, and 3m006). after an additional 15 h, luciferase production was measured as described in materials and methods. the data are representative of three
separate experiments and are expressed as fold change relative to vehicle
(dmso) control.

m.w., 318) and an inactive small molecule  xxxg2291xxx /8 analog, 3m-006, were
prepared by 3m pharmaceuticals. all imidazoquinolines were prepared in
dmso (sterile cell culture grade; sigma-aldrich) at a concentration of 10
mm and stored in aliquots at 4°c. lps (ultra pure; salmonella minnesota)
was obtained from invivogen. cpg oligonucleotide (cpg2216, gggg
gacgatcgtcgggggg) was obtained from invitrogen life technologies. phosphothioate-protected ssrna (ssrna40; 5⬘-gcccgucu
guugugugacuc; hiv-1 u5 region 108 –127) was synthesized (mwg
biotech) as previously described (20). the cationic lipid n-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-n,n,n-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (dotap liposomal transfection reagent; roche) was used to complex with ssrna40
before addition to cell cultures. abs linked to immunomagnetic beads were
used for positive selection and depletion of various cell types. these include bdca-4 for pdc, bdca-1 for mdc, and cd14 for monocytes
(miltenyi biotec). fluorochrome-labeled abs for flow cytometry include
non-dc lineage ab mixture-fitc, hla-dr-percp,  xxxg1208xxx -allophycocyanin, and human il-12-pe (bd pharmingen). nonspecific binding to
fcrs was prevented with fcr blocking reagent (miltenyi biotec). recombinant human cytokines gm-csf, il-4, and tgf-␤1 were obtained from
r&d systems. recombinant human tlr-7 (accession no. af240467) and
human  xxxg2292xxx  (accession no. af246971) were cloned into the pires expression vector (bd clontech). the nf-␬b-luciferase reporter construct
was obtained from bd clontech.

the minimum level of detection for ifn-␣ is 20 pg/ml. all other cytokines
and chemokines were detected using searchlight proteome arrays (pierce).
all cytokine and chemokine results are expressed in picograms per milliliter. the limit for all cytokines and chemokines detected by proteome
array is 40 pg/ml.

identification of cells expressing il-12 by flow cytometry
whole blood was stimulated with various tlr agonists for 5 h in the
presence of 10 ␮g/ml brefeldin a (sigma-aldrich). cells were harvested
and stained for 30 min with a non-dc lineage ab mixture (fitc),
hla-dr (percp), and  xxxg1208xxx  (allophycocyanin). blood cells were then
treated with facs lyse and perm2 buffers (bd biosciences) as directed for
intracellular staining. finally, cells were stained with anti-il-12-pe for 30
min, washed, and resuspended for flow cytometry. analysis for cytokine
production by peripheral blood dc was performed by gating on lin-(fitc)
and hla-dr⫹ (percp) cells. this population was further monitored for
the expression of  xxxg1208xxx  (allophycocyanin) and il-12 (pe).

results
identification of  xxxg2291xxx - and  xxxg2292xxx -selective agonists
several small molecules, structurally similar to  xxxd2339xxx  and
resiquimod, that induce cytokines from human pbmc were evaluated for their capacity to activate nf-␬b in cells transfected with
various human tlrs. hek293 cells were cotransfected with a
nf-␬b-luciferase reporter construct and human  xxxg2291xxx  or human
 xxxg2292xxx . the transfected hek293 cells were stimulated with imidazoquinoline molecules at 0.03–30 ␮m. three types of tlr agonists were identified based on their ability to activate nf-␬b in
cells transfected with either  xxxg2291xxx  or  xxxg2292xxx . one group activated
nf-␬b in cells transfected with  xxxg2291xxx , but not with  xxxg2292xxx  ( xxxg2291xxx 
agonists); another group activated nf-␬b in cells transfected with
 xxxg2292xxx , but not with  xxxg2291xxx  ( xxxg2292xxx  agonists); and a third group
activated nf-␬b in cells transfected with either  xxxg2291xxx  or  xxxg2292xxx 
( xxxg2291xxx /8 agonists). representative examples of the three groups of
small molecule tlr agonists are shown in fig. 1. the  xxxg2291xxx  agonist, 3m-001, preferentially activates nf-␬b through  xxxg2291xxx  at

⬃3 ␮m. the  xxxg2292xxx  agonist, 3m-002, preferentially activates
nf-␬b through  xxxg2292xxx  at ⬃3 ␮m. the  xxxg2291xxx /8 agonist, 3m-003,
activates nf-␬b through  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  with effective concentrations at 0.3 and 3 ␮m, respectively. note that significant nf-␬b
activation refers in this study to at least a 2-fold increase in luciferase production relative to the vehicle control or inactive analog
control, and the increase in luciferase production is concentration
dependent. 3m-006, an analog of the other small molecule tlr
agonists, does not activate nf-␬b in hek cells transfected with
either  xxxg2291xxx  or  xxxg2292xxx ; therefore, it will be referred to as an inactive
analog.
ifn-␣, tnf-␣, and il-12 production from human pbmc
stimulated with  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  agonists
to define the roles of  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  in cytokine production
from primary immune cells, representative examples of  xxxg2291xxx ,
 xxxg2292xxx , and  xxxg2291xxx /8 agonists were used to stimulate various populations of human innate immune cells. first, human pbmc were
stimulated with various concentrations of tlr agonists. after
24 h, ifn-␣, tnf-␣, and il-12 production was assessed (fig. 2).
the  xxxg2291xxx ,  xxxg2292xxx , and  xxxg2291xxx /8 agonists induce ifn-␣, tnf-␣,
and il-12 from human pbmc. these three cytokines were evaluated because they broadly represent cytokines produced by innate
immune cells and are known to be induced by tlr agonists. the
 xxxg2291xxx  agonist preferentially induces ifn-␣ secretion (fig. 2a).
production of ifn-␣ is seen at 0.03 ␮m, and ⬃100 times more
3m-001 is required to induce any tnf-␣ and il-12. the  xxxg2292xxx 
agonist induces tnf-␣ and il-12 at 0.3 ␮m, and ⬃3-times more
3m-002 is required to induce ifn-␣ production (fig. 2b). the
 xxxg2291xxx  agonist induces ⬃5–10 times more ifn-␣ than the  xxxg2292xxx 
agonist. in contrast, the  xxxg2292xxx  agonist induces ⬃10 times more
tnf-␣ and il-12 than the  xxxg2291xxx  agonist. the  xxxg2291xxx /8 agonist
3m-003 induces ifn-␣ at 0.03 ␮m and tnf-␣, and il-12 at 0.1 ␮m

functional differences between  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx 

(fig. 2c). the magnitude of the response for these three cytokines is
similar to the  xxxg2292xxx  agonist profile. the key difference between the
 xxxg2291xxx /8 and  xxxg2292xxx  agonist cytokine profile is that ifn-␣ is induced at
lower concentrations than tnf-␣ or il-12 by 3m-003  xxxg2291xxx /8 agonist. an inactive imidazoquinoline molecule, 3m-006, prepared in a
similar fashion to 3m-001, 3m-002, and 3m003, did not induce cytokines at concentrations up to 30 ␮m (fig. 2d).

concentrations; tnf-␣ and il-12 are induced at higher concentrations of 3m-001 (3–30 ␮m). in contrast, lower concentrations
of ssrna40 and 3m-002 are required to tnf-␣ and il-12 than
ifn-␣. the levels of ifn-␣ induced by ssrna40 and 3m-002 are
lower than the levels of tnf-␣ and il-12 across the entire concentration-response curve. note that the concentrations of ssrna40 used in fig. 3 are similar to those previously reported to
induce ifn-␣, tnf-␣, and il-12 from human pbmc (20). overall, the profile of ifn-␣, tnf-␣, and il-12 induced by the natural
 xxxg2292xxx  agonist ssrna40 is similar to the small molecule  xxxg2292xxx 
agonist 3m-002.

 xxxg2292xxx  agonist ssrna and 3m-002 induce similar cytokine
profiles from human pbmc

differential cytokine production from human pbmc stimulated
with  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  agonists
in addition to tnf-␣, il-12, and ifn-␣, other cytokines known to
be produced after tlr stimulation were evaluated from human
pbmc after stimulation with  xxxg2291xxx ,  xxxg2292xxx , and  xxxg2291xxx /8 agonists
(fig. 4). specifically, cytokines considered to be induced via an
nf-␬b-dependent mechanism, such as il-1 and il-8, and cytokines known to be associated with type i ifn induction, such as
ifn-␥-inducible protein-10, were also evaluated. the  xxxg2292xxx  agonist induces il-1␣/␤, il-6, il-8, mip-1␣␤, and mip-3␣␤. all
these cytokines are associated with inflammatory responses, particularly those thought to require activation of nf-␬b. the  xxxg2291xxx 
agonist induces much lower levels of these cytokines. in contrast,
the  xxxg2291xxx  agonist effectively induces  xxxg559xxx  and ifn-inducible t
cell ␣ chemoattractant (i-tac); these cytokines are ifn-inducible
cytokines. the  xxxg2292xxx  agonist induces these ifn-inducible cytokines to a lesser degree. the  xxxg2291xxx /8 agonist induces both proinflammatory and ifn-inducible cytokines; however, the levels of
 xxxg559xxx  and i-tac are lower than the levels induced by the  xxxg2291xxx 
agonist. the combined results in figs. 2– 4 indicate that the  xxxg2291xxx 
agonist more effectively induces ifn-␣ and ifn-regulated cytokines, whereas  xxxg2292xxx  agonists more effectively induce proinflammatory cytokines.

3m-002, and ssrna40 complexed with dotap. secreted ifn-␣, tnf-␣,

of detection for ifn-␣, tnf-␣, and il-12p40/70 are 20, 40, and 40 pg/ml,
respectively. note that dotap or dmso (small molecule diluent) did not
induce the production of cytokines from human pbmc (our unpublished
observations).

to determine the cell types within the pbmc population required
for ifn-␣, tnf-␣, and il-12 production after stimulation with the
 xxxg2291xxx - and  xxxg2292xxx -selective agonists, monocytes and pdc were
removed by immunomagnetic bead selection before stimulation
with 3m-001 and 3m-002. previously, the  xxxg2291xxx /8 agonist resiquimod was shown to require pdc for ifn-␣ production and
monocytes for tnf-␣ production from human pbmc (22, 26).
similarly, both  xxxg2291xxx - and  xxxg2292xxx -selective agonists lose the ability
to induce ifn-␣ from pdc-deficient pbmc (fig. 5). in contrast,
depletion of monocytes has a slight positive effect on ifn-␣ production. monocyte depletion does appear to affect low levels of
tnf-␣ production by 3m-001-stimulated pbmc. however, depletion of monocytes results in a 10- to 25-fold reduction in tnf-␣
production from  xxxg2292xxx  agonist 3m-002-stimulated pbmc. interestingly, depletion of pdc or monocytes from pbmc minimally
affects il-12 production. it is possible that some low level of nondepleted monocytes is responsible for the high level of il-12 produced in the pbmc culture or that other populations of cells either
by themselves or in combination with monocytes produce substantial levels of il-12. blood mdc were shown to produce il-12 in
response to resiquimod (10, 27). myeloid dc (bdca-1⫹) were
depleted from pbmc in a manner similar to pdc and monocyte
depletion as described above, and the levels of ifn-␣, tnf-␣, and
il-12 were not changed relative to the undepleted controls (j. p.
vasilakos, unpublished observations), indicating that mdc are not
solely responsible for the il-12 produced by the immune response

the putative natural ligand for  xxxg2292xxx , ssrna (ssrna40), has

 xxxg2292xxx  agonist ssrna40 and 3m-002 (fig. 3). similar to fig. 2, the

modifier-stimulated pbmc (j. p. vasilakos, unpublished observations). overall, these data indicate that both  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx 
agonists induce ifn-␣ from human pbmc in a pdc-dependent
fashion. in addition, monocyte stimulation by the trl8 agonist
contributes to the high levels of tnf-␣ from the pbmc
cultures.
the  xxxg2292xxx  agonist 3m-002 effectively stimulates cytokine
production from mdc, but not pdc
to identify il-12-producing cells in blood, intracellular cytokine
staining was assessed after stimulation of whole blood with various tlr agonists in the presence of brefeldin a, which inhibits the
secretion of cytokines, but does not affect their transcription or
translation. first, dc were identified by flow cytometry as lineage⫺, hla-dr⫹, which constitute ⬃0.5% of the blood cells
(fig. 6a). myeloid and pdc were further differentiated as  xxxg1208xxx ⫹
and  xxxg1208xxx ⫺, respectively. the tlr4,  xxxg2291xxx ,  xxxg2292xxx , and  xxxg2291xxx /8
agonists induced il-12 from the mdc, but not the pdc.  xxxg2292xxx  and
 xxxg2291xxx /8 agonists induced the highest percentage of il-12-producing mdc (⬃30%). approximately 14% of the mdc produced
il-12 in response to the tlr4 agonist, and 9% of the mdc produced il-12 after stimulation with the  xxxg2291xxx  agonist. the  xxxg2293xxx 
agonist and the vehicle control did not stimulate il-12 production.
in addition, the il-12 fluorescence intensity of the 3m-002- and
3m-003-treated groups was about half an order of magnitude

greater than the fluorescence intensity of the 3m-001-stimulated
group. the results indicate that activation of  xxxg2292xxx  in mdc results
in il-12 production, and the  xxxg2292xxx -selective agonist more effectively induces il-12-producing cells than the  xxxg2291xxx -selective agonist. the results in fig. 6a are consistent with those in fig. 2,
where 10 ␮m 3m-001, 3m-002, and 3m-003 induce detectable
levels of il-12 secretion from human pbmc. the results in fig. 2
show ⬃10-fold greater il-12 production from pbmc stimulated
via  xxxg2292xxx , and the results in fig. 6a show about a half-log increase
in il-12 fluorescence intensity in pbmc stimulated via  xxxg2292xxx .
the cell types within the pbmc culture responsible for the production of ifn-␣, tnf-␣, and il-12 after stimulation with  xxxg2291xxx 
and  xxxg2292xxx  agonists were also evaluated by enriching for various
cell types by positive selection. cd123high/hla-dr⫹/lin⫺ pdc
and  xxxg1208xxx ⫹/hla-dr⫹/lin⫺ mdc were cultured independently
and stimulated with various tlr agonists. plasmacytoid dc
(bdca-4 isolated) produced ifn-␣ in response to  xxxg2291xxx ,  xxxg2291xxx /8,
and  xxxg2293xxx  agonists (fig. 6b). tlr4 and  xxxg2292xxx  agonists did not
induce ifn-␣ from pdc-enriched cultures. il-12 was not produced by pdc in response to any of the agonists under the indicated conditions. similar findings were seen with bdca-2 isolated
pdc (j. p. vasilakos, unpublished observations). myeloid dc
(bdca-1 isolated) produced il-12 in response to tlr4,  xxxg2292xxx ,
and  xxxg2291xxx /8 agonists.  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2293xxx  agonists did not induce the

secretion of il-12 from mdc-enriched cultures. ifn-␣ is not produced by mdc in response to any of the agonists under the indicated conditions. tnf-␣ was produced by both isolated pdc and
mdc after stimulation with  xxxg2291xxx /8 agonist (fig. 6c). the  xxxg2291xxx 
and  xxxg2293xxx  agonists induced tnf-␣ production from isolated pdc,
and the tlr4 and  xxxg2292xxx  agonists induced tnf-␣ secretion from
isolated mdc.
to determine whether the blood dc subsets affect the stimulatory capacity of each other by the small molecule tlr agonists,
the pdc- and mdc-enriched populations were also cocultured and
stimulated with the same tlr agonists (fig. 6d). similar to individually cultured pdc and mdc, mixed blood dc produce
ifn-␣ in response to  xxxg2291xxx ,  xxxg2291xxx /8, and  xxxg2293xxx  agonists. tlr4
and  xxxg2292xxx  agonists do not induce ifn-␣ from the pdc/mdc
mixed culture. from the same culture, secreted il-12 is induced by
tlr4,  xxxg2291xxx /8, and  xxxg2292xxx  agonists.  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2293xxx  agonists do
not induce il-12 from the blood dc cultured under the indicated
conditions. the experiments indicate that mixing pdc and mdc
do not affect their cytokine response patterns to  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx 
agonists.
the  xxxg2292xxx  agonist 3m-002, but not the  xxxg2291xxx  agonist, effectively
stimulates cytokine production from monocytes and monocytederived dc (mo-dc)
monocytes express  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx , whereas mo-dc express
mainly  xxxg2292xxx  (9, 28). cytokine production from these cells was
determined after stimulation with  xxxg2291xxx - and  xxxg2292xxx -selective agonists (fig. 7). monocytes were isolated by positive selection with
cd14 magnetic beads. after stimulation with  xxxg2291xxx ,  xxxg2292xxx , and
 xxxg2291xxx /8 agonists, monocytes secreted tnf-␣ and il-12. however,
 xxxg2292xxx  and  xxxg2291xxx /8 agonists more effectively induced tnf-␣ and
il-12 from the monocytes than the  xxxg2291xxx  agonist. both  xxxg2292xxx  and
 xxxg2291xxx /8 agonists induced tnf-␣ and il-12 at ⬃0.1 ␮m; 30 –100
times more  xxxg2291xxx  agonist was required to induce the same cytokines from monocytes. the  xxxg2292xxx  and  xxxg2291xxx /8 agonists induced
⬃10- to 100-fold more secreted tnf-␣ and il-12 from the monocytes than the  xxxg2291xxx  agonists. in additional studies, monocytes
prepared as shown in fig. 6 produced tnf-␣ and il-12 in response to tlr2 and tlr4 agonists, but not in response to  xxxg2293xxx 
agonists (j. p. vasilakos, unpublished observations).

monocytes were differentiated in vitro into dc with gm-csf,
il-4, and tgf-␤ and stimulated with various tlr agonists (fig.
7). secreted tnf-␣ and il-12 were measured 24 h poststimulation. similar to monocytes, mo-dc produced tnf-␣ and il-12 in
response to  xxxg2292xxx  and  xxxg2291xxx /8 agonists. however, the  xxxg2291xxx  agonist did not induce either of these cytokines from the mo-dc. the
 xxxg2292xxx  agonist was slightly more potent than the  xxxg2291xxx /8 agonist,
and the  xxxg2292xxx  agonist induced slightly more tnf-␣ and il-12
from the mo-dc than the  xxxg2291xxx /8 agonist. in separate studies,
monocytes produced tnf-␣ and il-12 in response to tlr4 agonist, but not to  xxxg2293xxx  agonists (j. p. vasilakos, unpublished observations). overall, the results in fig. 7 demonstrate that monocyte and monocytes differentiated into dc with gm-csf, il-4,
and tgf-␤ are more effectively activated through  xxxg2292xxx  than
through  xxxg2291xxx  stimulation.
a schematic representation of all the results is shown in fig. 8.
overall the results indicate that despite phylogenetic and structural
similarities between  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx , these tlrs appear to differ
functionally with regard to cytokine profiles induced from human
pbmc as well as from isolated pbmc cell populations. furthermore,  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  seem to work in a cell-selective fashion, in
that  xxxg2291xxx  predominantly functions in pdc and  xxxg2292xxx  appears to
function primarily in mdc, monocytes, and mo-dc.

discussion
phylogenetic analysis shows that  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx , as well as
 xxxg2293xxx  belong to a subfamily of tlrs (29, 30). constitutively expressed  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  stimulate an nf-␬b signaling pathway
indirectly, supporting the assertion that these receptors are involved in cellular responses to stimuli that activate innate immunity. functionally,  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  are thought to form a subgroup within the tlr family that recognizes pathogen-associated
molecular patterns in endosomal/lysosomal compartments (31).
the function of  xxxg2291xxx  has been partially established due to the
availability of small molecule  xxxg2291xxx  agonists and  xxxg2291xxx -deficient
mice (21). the role of  xxxg2292xxx  is not well established due to the
apparent lack of function of murine  xxxg2292xxx  and the lack of tlr8selective agonists (23). recently, two guanosine- and uridine-rich
ssrna sequences, rna40 and rna42, were shown to activate
nf-␬b in hek cells transfected with human  xxxg2292xxx , but not with

function. because the promiscuous activity of resiquimod does not
easily allow for differentiation of  xxxg2291xxx - or  xxxg2292xxx -specific responses, it is possible that some of the effects of resiquimod considered to be  xxxg2291xxx -driven are actually  xxxg2292xxx -driven. to further

1266

functional differences between  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx 

elucidate the function of  xxxg2292xxx  and to further differentiate the functions of human  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  from each other, it is essential to
use agonists that selectively activate  xxxg2291xxx  or  xxxg2292xxx  on defined
populations of innate immune cells. therefore, using agonists selective for  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx , we evaluated cytokine production
from human pbmc or isolated monocytes, monocyte-derived dc,
blood mdc, and blood pdc after stimulation with appropriate
tlr agonists.
in this study we define  xxxg2291xxx - and  xxxg2292xxx -selective agonists by
their ability to activate nf-␬b in hek293 cells genetically reconstituted with either  xxxg2291xxx  or  xxxg2292xxx . the major caveat in this study
is that not all tlr-driven events are nf-␬b dependent. indeed,
cpg2216 is very effective at inducing ifn-␣ from pdc, but is
comparatively poor at inducing nf-␬b activation in hek cells
transfected with  xxxg2293xxx  (k. b. gorden, unpublished observations).
therefore, the term selective in this study is strictly used in the
context of nf-␬b activation in transfected hek293 cells. nevertheless, the results demonstrate that  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  agonists differentially induce cytokine production from isolated human innate
immune cells. both  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  agonists can induce ifn-␣,
tnf-␣, and il-12 production from pbmc. however, the  xxxg2291xxx 
agonist 3m-001 more effectively induces ifn-␣, and the  xxxg2292xxx 
agonist 3m-002 more effectively induces tnf-␣ and il-12. concordant with robust ifn-␣ production, cytokines  xxxg559xxx  and i-tac
are more effectively generated from  xxxg2291xxx -stimulated pbmc. although the precise mechanism of  xxxg559xxx  and i-tac induction after
3m-001 stimulation is unknown, both  xxxg559xxx  and i-tac can be
induced by the combination of ifn-␣ and tlr5 stimulation in
pbmc (32). these results are consistent with findings showing
that cpg oligodeoxynucleotides induce ifn-␣ from pdc, which
subsequently induces  xxxg559xxx  from monocytes (33). similarly, high
levels of tnf-␣ and il-12 production from  xxxg2292xxx -activated
pbmc are associated with high levels of il-1, il-6, il-8, and
other cytokines considered, in general, as proinflammatory cyto-

kines. therefore, it seems reasonable that high levels of proinflammatory cytokines requiring nf-␬b activation are the most effectively induced cytokines stimulated by the  xxxg2292xxx  agonist.
it is intriguing that the  xxxg2292xxx  agonist 3m-002 induces ifn-␣
from human pbmc in a pdc-dependent manner (fig. 5), but isolated pdc do not produce ifn-␣ after stimulation with the  xxxg2292xxx 
agonist (fig. 6, b and d). the reason for this discrepancy is unknown. one possibility is that the positive selection procedure for
pdc using magnetic microbeads may diminish the ability of pdc
to produce ifn-␣, particularly if the  xxxg2292xxx  agonist activates pdc
weakly through a  xxxg2291xxx -dependent mechanism. because  xxxg2291xxx ,
 xxxg2292xxx , and  xxxg2293xxx  are structurally similar, it is possible that the
 xxxg2292xxx  agonist used in this study can directly induce ifn-␣ from
pdc through  xxxg2291xxx , but to a lesser extent than the more effective
ifn-␣-inducing molecule 3m-001. another possibility is that the
 xxxg2292xxx  agonist may induce ifn-␣ production from pdc in human
pbmc culture in an indirect manner, where pdc are required for
ifn-␣ production, but additional cell types in the culture may
stimulate pdc to produce ifn-␣. finally, it is possible that efficient stimulation of ifn-␣ from pdc is independent of nf-␬b
stimulation through  xxxg2291xxx . this hypothesis is based on results using the very effective ifn-␣ inducer cpg2216, which is thought to
be a human  xxxg2293xxx  agonist, but poorly activates nf-␬b through
 xxxg2293xxx  in transfected hek293 cells (k. b. gorden, unpublished
observations). perhaps ifn-␣ induction from pdc is inhibited by
efficient nf-␬b activation through the tlr pathway, in that the
most effective nf-␬b activators may be the least effective ifn-␣
inducers and vice versa. studies are underway to resolve this
discrepancy.
results using two different ssrna  xxxg2292xxx  agonists show that
 xxxg2292xxx  activation results in tnf-␣, il-6, and il-12 production
from human pbmc (20); these results are consistent with the results reported in this study using the small molecule  xxxg2292xxx  agonist

data are expressed as picograms per

3m-002. interestingly, one of the ssrna sequences, rna40, induces ifn-␣ from pbmc and isolated pdc, but another singlestranded sequence, rna42, does not. the reported findings suggest that  xxxg2292xxx  activation in itself is not sufficient for ifn-␣
production from pdc, and that rna42, like 3m-002, has some
non- xxxg2292xxx  activity responsible for ifn-␣ induction from pdc.
perhaps ssrna may be recognized by human  xxxg2291xxx  in pdc, resulting in ifn-␣ production in an nf-␬b-independent manner.
regardless, it is likely that reconstitution studies with human
 xxxg2291xxx  in fibroblasts have limitations regarding the ifn-␣ signaling
pathway.
proinflammatory cytokine induction from monocytes, blood
mdc, and mo-dc are effectively induced with the  xxxg2292xxx  agonist,
as shown in this study. the tnf-␣- and il-12-inducing ability of
 xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  agonists is consistent with  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  expression patterns in monocytes and mo-dc. monocytes produce
cytokines in response to both  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  agonists, but the
cytokine levels induced by the  xxxg2292xxx  agonist are approximately

100 times greater than those induced by the  xxxg2291xxx  agonist. indeed,
the lack of tnf-␣ or il-12 production from mdc and mo-dc
after stimulation with the  xxxg2291xxx  agonist indicates that these cells
either do not express functional  xxxg2291xxx  or that nf-␬b activation in
these cells is insufficiently driven through  xxxg2291xxx  with the selected
small molecule  xxxg2291xxx  agonist. also consistent with tlr expression profiles,  xxxg2291xxx  expression decreases ⬃30-fold after differentiation of monocytes into mo-dc using gm-csf, il-4, and tgf␤1, and the  xxxg2291xxx  agonist loses the ability to induce cytokines
from mo-dc. although some correlation is shown between  xxxg2291xxx 
and  xxxg2292xxx  mrna expression and direct activation of various cell
populations with the  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  agonists, the correlation is
not exact, in that mo-dc express slightly more  xxxg2291xxx  than  xxxg2292xxx 
mrna (w. birmachu and j. a. hanten, unpublished observations), yet only the  xxxg2292xxx  agonist induces cytokine production
from mo-dc. therefore, the mrna levels of  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx 
expressed in monocytes and mo-dc do not sufficiently explain
their responses to the small molecule tlr agonists.
there is some controversy regarding whether human blood
mdc express  xxxg2291xxx  (9 –12). the results in this study indicate that
the  xxxg2291xxx  agonist 3m-001, which activates nf-␬b through  xxxg2291xxx ,
but not through  xxxg2292xxx , in hek cells and efficiently induces ifn-␣
from pdc, does not activate mdc. if mdc express  xxxg2291xxx , the
results shown in this study suggest that  xxxg2291xxx  is not functional in
mdc, at least with regard to tnf-␣ and il-12 production. it is
possible, however, that the positive selection method of isolating
mdc with bdca-1 microbeads diminishes the responsiveness of
the mdc to the  xxxg2291xxx  agonist 3m-001.
in conclusion, the results shown in this study indicate that  xxxg2291xxx 
and  xxxg2292xxx  are functionally distinct in human innate immune cells.
 xxxg2291xxx  in pdc is functionally associated with the production of
ifn-␣- and ifn-regulated cytokines, similar to the role of  xxxg2293xxx .
 xxxg2292xxx  functions in monocytes and myeloid dc and is involved in
the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf-␣.
these results suggest that  xxxg2292xxx  agonists may be effective at driving strong cell-mediated immune responses or th1-like immune
responses requiring myeloid dc activation, whereas  xxxg2291xxx  agonists may be important in driving ig production. the  xxxg2291xxx - and
 xxxg2292xxx -selective agonists presented in this study can now be used to
address this hypothesis as well as to understand the nature of the
precise connections between innate and adaptive immunities.

figure 8. the relative effects of  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  stimulation on cytokine production from human pbmc and various types of purified cells
from human pbmc. a, human pbmc preferentially produce ifn-␣, ip10, and i-tac in response to stimulation with the  xxxg2291xxx -selective agonist
(double arrow). other cytokines, typically regarded as nf-␬b-regulated
cytokines, such as tnf-␣, and il-12 are also produced by  xxxg2291xxx -activated
pbmc, but to a lesser extent (single arrow). comparatively,  xxxg2292xxx -selective stimulation of human pbmc preferentially induces nf-␬b-regulated
cytokines associated with inflammation, such as tnf-␣ and il-12 (double
arrows). ifn-␣,  xxxg559xxx , and i-tac are also induced by the  xxxg2292xxx -selective
agonist, but to a lesser extent (single arrow). b,  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  agonists
differentially stimulate human innate immune cells. plasmacytoid dc are
the primary cells stimulated by the  xxxg2291xxx -selective agonist; monocytes are
activated to a lesser degree. therefore, activation of  xxxg2291xxx  results in preferential activation of pdc and ifn-␣ production. in contrast, mdc, monocytes, and mo-dc (gm-csf/il-4/tgf-␤) are preferentially activated
through  xxxg2292xxx , cells that predominantly produce proinflammatory cytokines. the  xxxg2291xxx  and  xxxg2292xxx  mrna expression levels reported for human
innate immune cells are consistent with the differential effects of  xxxg2291xxx  and
 xxxg2292xxx  activation (9 –12, 28, 34 –36). ⫹, expression of the indicated tlr;
⫺, no detectable expression of the indicated tlr; ⫾, some studies have
measured the indicated tlr and others did not detect measurable
expression.
