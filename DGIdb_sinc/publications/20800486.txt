analogs of the known h1-antihistamine r- xxxd1894xxx  with suitable selectivity for key gpcrs, p450
enzymes and herg channel were assessed for metabolism proﬁle and in vivo properties. several analogs
were determined to exhibit diverse metabolism. one of these compounds, 10a, showed equivalent efﬁcacy in a rat eeg/emg model to a previously identiﬁed clinical candidate and a potentially superior pharmacokinetic proﬁle as determined from a human microdose study.

insomnia is one of the most common cns disorders, affecting
one third of the general population, with a prevalence range of
10–48% in industrialized nations.1 the condition has a signiﬁcant
economic impact on managed care2 and the workplace.3 accordingly, treatment options are becoming increasingly desirable for
which pharmacologic agents have become a convenient option of
choice. while agents that act on the benzodiazepine binding site
of the  xxxd2177xxx  (gabaa) receptor have been approved and provide positive effects for both sleep onset and maintenance, concerns over side effects associated with daytime
sedation, cognitive impairment, motor effects, and complex behaviors4–6 have prompted investigations of other sedative hypnotic
mechanisms.7,8
novel selective h1-antihistamines with appropriate exposure
are of potential interest as an alternative to current medications
for the treatment of insomnia, particularly for improvements in
sleep during the latter third of the night and overall sleep efﬁciency.9 these agents would also be expected to have a low potential for abuse and likely would be non-scheduled unlike the current

gabaa hypnotics.10 recently, derivatives of the selective and
sedating h1-antihistamine r- xxxd1894xxx  (1),11 namely 2, 3a
and 3b, were identiﬁed as highly selective compounds for the h1
receptor with sedating properties (fig. 1).12
metabolism of 1 has been reported to likely predominate via
ﬁrst pass mechanisms.13 based on this premise it was hypothesized that pharmacokinetic properties of analogs of 1 could be reasonably estimated from projections of clearance, ﬁrst studied
in vitro followed by in vivo conﬁrmation in animals. from the
pharmacokinetic analysis of the analogs in figure 1, compound 2
was determined to have a desirable proﬁle and advanced into clinical trials.12 despite suitable selectivity and sedative properties of
compounds 3a and 3b, a subsequent assessment of their metabolism in human liver microsomes (hlm) identiﬁed an issue with
their suitability as lead compounds. analysis of the metabolism
of compound 3a in human liver microsomes (hlm) showed a similar metabolite proﬁle to 1; the major metabolite being the 6hydroxyindene, 4 (fig. 2).14 smaller amounts of the des-methyl
metabolite, 5, and n-oxide, 6, were also observed. however, in an
analysis of the enzymatic pathways associated with this metabolism, using either inhibitory antibodies speciﬁc to cyp450 enzymes
or recombinant cyp450 enzymes, it was determined that the enzyme responsible for the vast proportion of metabolism (>90% in
hlm) was cyp2d6. a similar analysis of compound 3b indicated

a comparable metabolite proﬁle to 3a in which cyp2d6 was also
determined to be the major contributor to metabolism in the
hlm assay. the characterization of these compounds as predominant cyp2d6 substrates presented two issues. besides the liability
of drug interactions, heterogeneity of cyp2d6 activity within the
general population raised the concern of extreme variability in
pharmacokinetics for candidate compounds.15 pk variability in
our leads was considered an issue because of the potential of varying exposures to adversely impact duration of action.
assessment of the metabolite proﬁle in the early leads implied
that modiﬁcations to the 6-position of the indene core would impact metabolic stability and lead to potential changes in the enzymatic pathways contributing to biotransformation of the parent
compound. previous studies have shown that modiﬁcations to this
position are tolerated within the h1 pharmacophore.16 this information suggested a strategy to identify potential backup compounds with diversiﬁed biotransformation through the synthesis
of analogs of general structure 7. a follow up study based on this
idea led to the identiﬁcation of a number of potent analogs with
suitable receptor, cyp enzyme and herg channel selectivity.14
these compounds satisﬁed the preset criteria of high h1 binding
afﬁnity (ki <10 nm), greater than 100-fold binding selectivity versus other receptor targets, greater than 1000-fold selectivity for
cyp enzyme inhibition and a herg ic50/h1 ki selectivity of 400 or
greater.
the study described in this letter had two objectives. the ﬁrst
objective was to proﬁle a set of 8 analogs of 1, previously identiﬁed
with suitable selectivity proﬁles,14 for risks as predominant
cyp2d6 substrates. the second objective was to assess leads of
interest arising from the metabolism proﬁling study for suitable
in vitro and in vivo pharmacology required for a sedative hypnotic.
this included evaluation of in vitro selectivity versus a broader

range of targets, pharmacokinetics, and in vivo efﬁcacy in a rat
electroencephalography/electromyography (eeg/emg) model.
synthesis of these analogs is outlined in scheme 1. indene analogs were synthesized in analogous fashion to that previously reported12,14,16 through base mediated coupling of a suitable akyl
heteroaromatic to the indanone (8) followed by acidic work up
and chiral separation (if r1 = me) to yield the desired analogs 3,
9–11.
compounds with cyp2d6 contributions estimated to be less
than 60% were hypothesized to have reduced liabilities for drug
interactions and pk variability. a screening strategy to determine
estimates of biotransformation through cyp2d6 was realized using
several methods. in a primary screen a comparison of the predicted
intrinsic clearance in hlm with and without the speciﬁc cyp2d6
inhibitor quinidine was used to calculate an estimate of biotransformation of the candidate compound through the cyp2d6 pathway. while acceptable as an initial screen, stable compounds
with low predicted intrinsic clearance (less than 10 ml/min/kg)
were expected to provide false negatives, due to uncertainties in
the low clearance values generated, such that inhibition of
cyp2d6-related metabolism would be difﬁcult to measure in the
microsomal assay. consequently, follow up studies using speciﬁc
p450 antibodies and recombinant cyp enzymes were performed
to conﬁrm the quinidine results. in the ﬁrst of these approaches,
the formation of the major metabolites was monitored in the presence of antibodies to speciﬁc cyp enzymes. data from this study
was used to provide a semi-quantitative assessment of the total
contribution of cyp2d6 to biotransformation. the reduction in
the amount of each metabolite formed in the presence of cyp2d6
antibody was estimated as a percentage of total metabolism and in
comparison to the contributions from other cyp antibodies. in a
second and complimentary method, formation of the major metabolite was assessed using individual recombinant cyp enzymes to
conﬁrm the estimate from the antibody studies.17 although the
current literature suggests primary metabolism of compounds of
this type to be through phase i mediated mechanisms, metabolism
of key compounds was also evaluated in hepatocytes to determine
any additional phase ii effects on biotransformation.18
a primary assessment from the cyp2d6 screen of the r- xxxd1894xxx  analogs is shown in table 1 in comparison to lead compounds 3a and 3b. of the analogs tested, quinidine inhibition
studies immediately excluded several analogs (3c, 9b, 9c) with
too high a contribution from cyp2d6 for further consideration. in
these cases, changes in intrinsic clearance in the presence or absence of quinidine were clearly signiﬁcant. of the more stable

compounds, 3d passed the initial screen. however, follow up studies using cyp450 antibodies or recombinant enzymes clearly indicated that the majority of biotransformation occurred via the
cyp2d6 pathway (estimates from these studies indicated metabolism by cyp2d6 as greater than 80%). interestingly, the 6-methoxy
analog 9a exhibited low metabolism through the cyp2d6 pathway.
however in this case, antibody studies indicated that much of the
metabolism predominated through the cyp3a4 pathway. since a
predominant cyp3a4 substrate would present similar development issues to a predominant cyp2d6 substrate, this compound
was not analyzed further. of the remaining compounds, 10b and
11a showed signiﬁcantly reduced contributions to metabolism
from cyp2d6, further conﬁrmed in follow up studies with antibodies and recombinant enzymes. compound 10a demonstrated minimal cyp2d6 contribution in the microsome studies using
quinidine. however, the follow up studies with antibodies indicated that the cyp2d6 component (64%) was near the previously
set metabolism criteria (60%). further analysis in hepatocytes for
the compounds in table 1 indicated that both compounds 3b and
10a formed signiﬁcant amounts of a stable n-glucuronide (esti-

mated as 26% and 47%, respectively of total metabolites),18 a phenomenon previously reported for diphenhydramine.19 this result
rekindled interest in these compounds as this was likely to significantly diversify metabolism away from cyp2d6. the other compounds tested showed no second phase metabolism of parent
compound.
generally, indene analogs lacking a 6-substituent (3) were signiﬁcant substrates of cyp2d6. from antibody studies, metabolism
of these compounds was characterized by oxidation products at
the 6-position.20 these metabolites appeared to be formed via
the 2d6 pathway as observed for the original substrate 3a. addition of the chiral methyl in 3b provided only a modest reduction
in biotransformation through this pathway compared to compound 3a. the identiﬁcation of an n-glucuronide from metabolism
in hepatocytes for this compound, however, diversiﬁed metabolism sufﬁciently for this compound to meet our criteria. of the
6-substituted indene analogs, all the examples in the 6-methoxy
series displayed signiﬁcant biotransformation (estimated >60%)
through either cyp2d6 or cyp3a4. in contrast, both 6-ﬂuoro
and 6-methyl chiral indenes 10b and 11a showed minimal

biotransformation via the cyp2d6 pathway. while the achiral
compound 10a also provided a reduction in cyp2d6 biotransformation compared to the original substrate 3a, the n-glucuronidation observed in hepatocytes was necessary to fully diversify the
metabolism proﬁle for this compound. these data taken together
suggest that 6-ﬂuoro or 6-methyl substitutions in combination
with the chiral methyl were the most appropriate modiﬁcations
for modulation of metabolism away from the cyp2d6 pathway.
with the identiﬁcation of a series of analogs with clearly diversiﬁed metabolic proﬁles, a more detailed comparison of the in vitro
proﬁles of compounds 3b, 10a–b and 11a was made to our clinical
candidate (2, table 2).12 all compounds had high h1 binding afﬁnity and were highly selective for cyp2d6 inhibition, monoamine
receptors associated with other sedation mechanisms [h3; 5ht2a; m1], and receptors that could potentiate side effects [m1,
m3] associated with known h1-antihistamines. broader assessment
of the selectivity proﬁle in a cerep panel indicated minimal binding
afﬁnity for other targets with the exception of compounds 10b and
11a. both of these analogs showed signiﬁcant binding afﬁnity for
 xxxg1079xxx  with little selectivity for h1 [10b: h2 ki = 4.5 nm;
11a: h2 94% inhibition at 1 lm]. typically, known h1-antihistamines, including  xxxd1894xxx , display poor binding to the h2
receptor (selectivity for h1 versus h2 is well over 100-fold).21 the
3-methoxy substituent of the pyrazine was implicated in the increased binding towards the  xxxg1079xxx  since this activity was
not observed in the unsubstituted analogs. the impact of functional antagonism of h2 receptors in the central compartment is
unclear although safety concerns with certain patient populations
have been raised for known h2 antagonists.22
the other factor expected to impact selection of candidate compounds was pharmacokinetic proﬁle. single dose studies of 1 have
indicated sedative effects up to 5 h in humans,23 the reported halflife of racemic  xxxd1894xxx  being approximately 5 h.24 more recently doxepin, a potent non-selective h1-antihistamine with reported elimination half-life of 18 h,25 has shown sleep
maintenance effects up to 8 h at low doses with no next day residual effects.9 from this data it was hypothesized that analogs of 1
with similar or incrementally longer half-life than 1 would represent suitable candidates for further evaluation of dose, exposure
and sedative action.12 in this study, candidate selection was based
on projections of in vitro clearance that was subsequently conﬁrmed through in vivo studies. comparison of the compounds in
table 2 indicated that analogs 3b and 10a were likely to represent
incrementally longer exposure compounds, while compounds 10b
and 11a appeared more similar to the benzothiophene lead (2) previously identiﬁed.12
overall from this study, 3b and 10a retained desirable selectivity proﬁles and sufﬁcient stability based on clearance measurements to represent potential alternatives to the lead
benzothiophene. in vivo properties of 10a were subsequently assessed and compared to the other leads 2 and 3b (table 3). eeg
studies for 10a exhibited a similar and signiﬁcant increase in
nrem sleep in rats without effects on rem sleep (not shown) in accord with reported effects of h1-antihistamines on sleep-wake
parameters under these conditions.26,12 none of the compounds

tested showed appreciable effects on latency to any sleep stage.
plasma concentrations from surrogate animals for 2 and 10a at
1 h were similarly low despite the 10-fold variance in the minimally effective doses employed. this was likely due to lower clearance and enhanced stability of 10a in rats,27 in contrast to that
previously observed for 2 and the other analogs examined.12 surrogate pk studies of 10a showed maximum brain levels of 11 ng/g at
1 h following a dose of 3 mg/kg, indicating that this analog was
also brain penetrating. allometric assessment of 10a projected a
human clearance of 5.7 ml/min/kg28 that was lower than previously estimated for compounds 2 and 3b or reported for racemic
 xxxd1894xxx .24 human microdose data indicated a measured
half-life for 10a of 9.5 h with median clearance of 2.3 ml/min/kg.28
evaluation of the human pharmacokinetic data indicated suitable half-lives for all 3 compounds within the desirable range of
5–18 h.12 however, for the small sample size assessed, 2 and 3b
showed signiﬁcant variability as reﬂected in the ranges of mean
half-life and auc (table 3) following oral dosing. variability of this
magnitude was also reported for racemic dimethindene24 and originally attributed to variations in either absorption as a function of
pka or ﬁrst pass metabolism. in this study the less basic benzothiophene 2 (measured pka 8.529) showed similar variability to the
more basic indene 3b (measured pka 9.1). in contrast, variability
in all corresponding parameters for 10a was signiﬁcantly less despite similar basic character to 3b (measured pka 9.1) suggesting
that variation in absorption on the basis of pka is unlikely. interestingly, compounds 2 and 3b trended to reduced variability in clearance upon iv dosing. whether these data support a speciﬁc effect
of ﬁrst pass metabolism on pk variability or some other factor is
unclear. compound 10a was conﬁrmed as a highly stable compound which, combined with high measured bioavailability
(62%), would be expected to provide a candidate with reduced variation in pk properties. this observed trend was consistent with
the high variability in the human pk data previously described
for a high clearance benzothiophene analog that was also considered as a backup.30 overall, the reduced variability observed in
10a was more desirable from a pharmacokinetic perspective in order to generate a more reproducible sedation proﬁle devoid of adverse events associated with next day sedation and warrants
further evaluation.
in summary, metabolic proﬁles of a series of 6-substituted indenes were assessed in order to identify a number of novel, selective
h1-antihistamines lacking a cyp2d6 substrate liability previously
noted. substituents, including the ﬂuoro, methyl, and methoxy
group, were incorporated into the 6-position of the indene core
with varying results on biotransformation through the cyp2d6
pathway. the 6-ﬂuoro or 6-methyl modiﬁcations afforded the
highest probability of identifying compounds with diversiﬁed
metabolism. due to formation of stable n-glucuronides, some compounds passed our criteria for diversiﬁed biotransformation. an
additional key driver in compound selection was focused on pharmacokinetic properties. 6-fluoro analog 10a was efﬁcacious in a
rat eeg/emg model and exhibited suitable pharmacokinetics with
a trend to reduced variability. this compound was adjudged to
have a proﬁle superior to two previously identiﬁed lead com-
