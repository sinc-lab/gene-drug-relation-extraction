abstract
five potent, lipophilic b-adrenoceptor antagonists (carvedilol,  xxxd2957xxx , toliprolol and fluorinated analogs of  xxxd384xxx  and
 xxxd2869xxx ) were labeled with either carbon-11 or fluorine-18 and evaluated for cerebral b-adrenoceptor imaging in experimental
animals. the standard radioligand for autoradiography of b-adrenoceptors, [125i]-iodocyanopindolol, was also included in this
survey. all compounds showed either very low uptake in rat brain or a regional distribution that was not related to
b-adrenoceptors, whereas some ligands did display specific binding in heart and lungs. apparently, the criteria of a high affinity
and a moderately high lipophilicity were insufficient to predict the suitability of b-adrenergic antagonists for visualization of
b-adrenoceptors in the central nervous system. © 2001 elsevier science ltd. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
cerebral b-adrenoceptors have been reported to be
affected in a variety of disorders, such as depression
(de paermentier et al., 1990, 1992), hostility (suarez et
al., 1997), schizophrenia (joyce et al., 1992), chronic
alcohol abuse (valverius et al., 1989) and alzheimer’s
and huntington’s disease (kalaria et al., 1989; waeber
et al., 1991). the generally observed delayed onset of
action of antidepressant drugs may be due to the fact
that downregulation of b-adrenoceptors is required for
the antidepressant activity (garattini and samanin
1984; caldecott-hazard et al., 1991; de paermentier et
al., 1991; okada and tokumitsu, 1994). to acquire
more insight into noradrenergic neurotransmission
within the human brain, it would be of interest to
develop a technique for noninvasive visualization of
cerebral b-adrenoceptors.
imaging of b-adrenoceptors within the cns requires
a radioligand with high affinity and specificity, low
protein binding and slow metabolism. moreover, the

radiopharmaceutical should be transported across the
blood –brain barrier (bbb). the cerebral endothelium
acts as a lipophilic physical barrier by which the passive
entry of hydrophilic compounds into the brain is restricted. the cns entry of drugs is optimal at an
octanol/water partition coefficient (log p) of about +2
(levin, 1980; dischino et al., 1983; moerlein et al.,
1985; shah et al., 1989). higher or lower values for
lipophilicity normally result in strongly reduced brain
uptake.
attempts to visualize cerebral b-adrenoceptors with
medical imaging techniques have been reported in the
literature. the lipophilic ligand [18f]fluorocarazolol
(log p+ 2.2 at ph 7.4) can easily be prepared (zheng et
al., 1994) and used to visualize b-adrenoceptors in the
human cns (van waarde et al., 1997). however, the
ames test has shown that fluorocarazolol is mutagenic
(doze et al., 2000b). thus, fluorocarazolol can no
longer be used in human studies.  xxxd431xxx , a registered
drug and the parent compound of fluorocarazolol, has
been labeled with carbon-11 (berridge et al., 1994).
unfortunately, [11c] xxxd431xxx  showed a very low brain
uptake, which was dominated by the nonspecific binding (berridge et al., 1994; doze et al., 2000a).

other lipophilic b-adrenoceptor antagonists have
been labeled with positron-emitting radionuclides.
[11c]propranolol (berger et al., 1982; antoni et al.,
1989) showed high non-specific binding in vivo (syrota,
1986, 1987) and is therefore unsuitable for b-adrenoceptor imaging. similar observations were made for the
fluorinated analog [18f]fluoropropranolol (log p+ 2.12
at ph 7.4; tewson et al., 1999). negative results have
also been reported for the b-2-selective antagonist
[11c]ici 118,551 (moresco et al., 2000), whereas the b-1
selective radioligand [11c]bisoprolol showed some specific binding in pituitary, but not in other regions of the
brain (soloviev et al., 2001).
in the present study, six new antagonists were
screened for passage of the bbb and visualization of
cerebral b-adrenoceptors. candidates were selected on
the basis of their in vitro affinity and lipophilicity.
[125i]-iodocyanopindolol was included in this survey,
since the radioligand is very potent (engel et al., 1981)
and commonly used for autoradiography (slesinger et
al., 1988; saito et al., 1989; flügge et al., 1997). moreover, a carbon-11-labeled analog of iodocyanopindolol
could easily be prepared if the biodistribution data of
the radio-iodinated compound were promising.

3. results

3.1. [ 11c] -car6edilol and its isomers
biodistribution studies in male wistar rats
demonstrated that carv hardly entered the brain,
either  xxxd1891xxx  min (data not shown) or at 60 min after
injection. cerebral uptake of radioactivity amounted to
0.08 90.02 (suv, table 2). the uptake of carv in
some brain regions was reduced after treatment with
propranolol. this effect was not significant in frontal
cortex, hippocampus and medulla, but statistically
significant (pb0.05) in the whole brain and
parietal/temporal/occipital cortex (table 2). however,
the reduction in radioactivity did not correspond to
regional b-adrenoceptor densities.
in contrast, significant uptake of carv was found
in peripheral tissues both  xxxd1891xxx  min (data not shown)
and at 60 min post injection. in heart, lung, red blood
cells and spleen, which are known to contain
b-adrenoceptors, uptake levels of 0.719 0.50,
6.3291.29, 0.249 0.14 and 0.999 0.18 were found
after 60 min (table 2). however, myocardial and
pulmonary
uptake
were
not
reduced
after
administration of propranolol (table 2). only in the
spleen, propranolol significantly reduced tissue uptake
to 55% of the control value.

3.2. [ 11c] - xxxd2957xxx  and [ 11c] -toliprolol
brain uptake of tol and pin was low and
insensitive to propranolol, both  xxxd1891xxx  min (data not
shown) and at 60 min after injection (table 2). the
binding of tol in heart and lung was low (0.339 0.29
and 1.5691.00) and largely non-specific (table 2). in
contrast, the binding of pin in lung, spleen and
erythrocytes (suv 2.359 0.66, 0.6790.19 and
0.249 0.1, respectively) was significantly reduced by
propranolol treatment to 43, 44 and 51% of the
corresponding control values (table 2).
18

3.3. [ f] -fluorinated  xxxd384xxx  and  xxxd2869xxx 
analogs
fluorine-18 uptake into the brain, 60 min after injection of isobup, ranged from 0.359 0.03 in the cerebellum to 0.6190.08 in the hippocampus (table 2).
however, pretreating the animals with propranolol did
not reduce levels of radioactivity in any brain region.
low levels of fluorine-18 were found in heart, lung,

151

rbc and spleen, 60 min post injection and again these
levels were not reduced after propranolol pretreatment.
the other fluorine-18 labeled radioligand, isopen,
showed significant entry into the brain. cerebral uptake
of radioactivity ranged from 1.249 0.17 in the olfactory bulbs to 1.839 0.25 in the thalamus at 60 min post
injection (table 2). however, propranolol treatment did
not reduce these levels, indicating that the uptake of
isopen in various brain regions is dominated by the
nonspecific binding. in heart, lung, red blood cells and
spleen, suvs of 1.169 0.35, 12.99 4.4, 0.5690.05 and
2.139 0.36, respectively, were found 60 min after injection (table 2). propranolol did not reduce tissue uptake
of radioactivity in heart and lung, whereas in rbc and
spleen a slight reduction was observed to 73 and 71% of
the corresponding control values (table 2).

3.4. [ 125i] -iodocyanopindolol
the radioiodinated ligand icyp (table 2) hardly
entered the brain. low levels of 125i were found, ranging from 0.059 0.01 in cortex, hippocampus, medulla
and pons, to 0.0990.01 in cerebellum and striatum.
however, cerebral uptake was significantly reduced by
propranolol in all regions, even those containing few
b-adrenoceptors (table 2). propranolol reduced the
uptake of iodine-125 to 14% in amygdala and frontal
cortex and to 44% in striatum. however, the regional
distribution of 125i did not correspond to b-adrenoceptor densities found with icyp in vitro (grimm et al.,
1992; data not shown). in the heart, lung, red blood
cells and spleen, high levels of 125i were observed
(3.0590.29, 20.29 1.86, 2.089 0.58, 3.6290.12),
which were reduced significantly by propranolol to 14,
9.5, 9 and 17% of the respective control values (table
2).

4. discussion
receptor imaging requires a specific signal above
background radioactivity. to predict if a radioligand
will provide a specific signal that can be detected externally, often the bound/free ratio (b/f) is estimated
from the scatchard equation (scatchard, 1949):
b/f = bmax/kd − b/kd
since the specific activity of pet ligands is very high
(i.e. b is very small), the term b/kd can be neglected
and b/f is approximately equal to bmax/kd. this ratio,
originating from equilibrium binding equations developed for in vitro binding assays, describes target/nontarget binding in the ideal case. the in vivo ratio of b/f
is often much lower because of metabolism, protein
binding and non-specific uptake of the radioligand. for
receptor imaging, a b/f ratio of ]4 is required (good-

152

p. doze et al. / neurochemistry international 40 (2002) 145–155

enough and atkins, 1988; eckelman and gibson, 1992).
the use of radioligands with high b/f ratios (20 and 55
for cgp 12177 and fluorocarazolol, respectively (van
waarde et al., 1995) resulted in high-quality images of
myocardial b-adrenoceptors, in contrast to the use of
 xxxd123xxx , which exhibits a b/f ratio of 0.65 (francis et
al., 1982). similarly, in the brain an estimated b/f of 20
seemed sufficient to obtain reasonable target-to-nontarget ratios, since fluorocarazolol provided good images
of cerebral b-adrenoceptors (van waarde et al., 1997).
for the present survey, we selected b-antagonists with a
b/f ratio of ]4 (table 1: b/f ranged from 5 (bup) to
21 (tol)). it should be noted, however, that there is a
large uncertainty in the affinities of ligands measured in
vitro. affinities of b-adrenoceptor antagonists reported
in the literature may vary by a factor 10 depending on
the assay conditions and the laboratory of assay. it is
thus possible that the affinity of some compounds that
were tested here was lower than suggested, resulting in
b/f ratios b4.
the ability of a compound to enter the brain is related
to its lipid solubility, protein binding, molecular size,
charge and efflux mediated by transport proteins, such
as p-glycoprotein (doze et al., 2000a). we used the
lipophilicity of the compound at physiological ph, as a
second criterion for the ligand selection. compounds
with log p’s (ph 7.4) between 0.22 (tol) and 1.97
(carv), were tested on the assumption that they would
be able to pass the blood– brain barrier. finally, we
selected only compounds that could be radiolabeled by
current synthetic procedures.

4.1. [ 11c] -car6edilol
carvedilol is a registered drug for the treatment of
hypertension. it is a non-selective b-antagonist which
displays a nanomolar affinity for b-adrenoceptors
(nichols et al., 1989; ruffolo et al., 1990; bristow et al.,
1992). despite its moderate lipophilicity (table 1), entry
of the radioligand into the brain was negligible and tissue
uptake was dominated by nonspecific binding. the low
brain uptake could be due to extensive binding of
11
c-carvedilol to plasma proteins (stahl et al., 1993) and
to rapid extrusion of the radioligand from the brain by
p-glycoprotein in the blood– brain barrier (neuhoff et
al., 2000).

4.2. [ 11c] -toliprolol
the antagonistic potency of toliprolol (inhibition of
tachycardiac response) is similar to that of propranolol
(wuppermann et al., 1978) and the compound is moderately lipophilic (log p at ph 7.4 is +0.22, harada et
al., 1981). therefore, tol appeared to have the appropriate characteristics for cerebral b-adrenoceptor imaging. however, tissue uptake of tol was dominated by

the nonspecific binding, both in the brain and in peripheral target organs, such as heart and lung. although uptake of radioactivity in the brain was
sufficient for detection with pet, tol seems unsuitable for visualization of cerebral b-adrenoceptors.

4.3. [ 11c] - xxxd2957xxx 
the anti-hypertensive agent  xxxd2957xxx  has a subnanomolar affinity to b-adrenoceptors (raffel, 1991). a
pet study with [18f]-fluorocarazolol has shown that
clinically employed doses of  xxxd2957xxx  result in an almost complete occupancy of b-adrenoceptors in the
human brain (van waarde et al., 1997). moreover, the
use of  xxxd2957xxx , like other lipophilic b-blockers, has
been associated with cns side effects (mcainsh and
cruickshank, 1990). studies with 125i-labeled  xxxd2957xxx 
have indicated that this ligand shows specific binding to
cerebral b-adrenoceptors in vivo (tondo et al., 1985),
although uptake of radioactivity into the brain (0.03–
0.04%/g tissue, 2 h p.i.) was not sufficient for pet or
spect imaging.  xxxd2957xxx  has been labeled with carbon-11 by the orsay pet center (prenant et al., 1987),
but the brain uptake of this radioligand was not examined at that time.
in the present study, we observed that carbon-11
levels in rat brain were very low after administration of
pin and that the regional distribution of radioactivity
did not correspond to that of b-adrenoceptors. although  xxxd2957xxx  shows considerable brain uptake at
clinical dosing (van waarde et al., 1997), apparently
uptake in the cns is much lower at tracer dosing.
therefore, 11c-pin is not suitable for visualization of
b-adrenoceptors in the brain with pet. however, in
lung, spleen and erythrocytes, 11c-pin displayed specific binding, although tissue/plasma values were low
compared to other radioligands (van waarde et al.,
1998). thus, the active s(−)-isomer of pin may have
some potential for visualization of b2-adrenoceptors in
the lung.

4.4. [ 18f] -fluorinated  xxxd2869xxx  and  xxxd384xxx  analogs
 xxxd2869xxx  and  xxxd384xxx  both have a high (subnanomolar to nanomolar) affinity for b-adrenoceptors
(cohen et al., 1980; wachter et al., 1980; lemoine et
al., 1985). they are aryloxypropanolamines containing
a tertiary butyl group (table 1). the tert-butyl group
can be replaced by an isopropyl group, which allows
labeling with fluorine-18.
both iso- xxxd2869xxx  and iso- xxxd384xxx  showed significant entry into the brain, as could be expected from
their moderate lipophilicities (log p+1.32 and +1.23,
respectively). however, tissue uptake of these radioligands was dominated by the nonspecific binding, both
in the brain and in peripheral organs, such as heart and

p. doze et al. / neurochemistry international 40 (2002) 145–155

lung. thus, iso- xxxd2869xxx  and iso- xxxd384xxx  are not
suitable for b-adrenoceptor imaging.

4.5. [ 125i] -iodocyanopindolol
icyp is commonly used for in-vitro and autoradiography studies because of its high affinity to b-adrenoceptors (morin et al., 1992). 123i-icyp can visualize
b-adrenoceptors in the heart of dogs (sisson et al.,
1991; sisson, 1997) and rats (tewson and berridge,
1986). because of a moderately high lipophilicity
(log p+1.26, staehelin et al., 1983), the characteristics
of icyp seem ideal for visualization of cerebral badrenoceptors. for this purpose, icyp could be labeled
with carbon-11 using 11c-acetone. since 125i-icyp is
readily available, it was used in the present pilot study
to examine the feasibility of icyp for in-vivo imaging
of cerebral b-adrenoceptors with pet.
however, brain uptake of icyp was found to be
very low. the low cerebral uptake could be inhibited by
propranolol, but the regional distribution of radioactivity did not correspond to that of cerebral b-adrenoceptors. probably, icyp binds not only to
b-adrenoceptors, but also to 5ht1b-receptors in rat
brain which correspond to the 5ht1db receptors in
humans (kd = 0.23 nm; hoyer et al., 1985). since the
brain uptake of icyp is very low, resulting in poor
count statistics and since the specific signal originates
from interaction of the drug with several monoamine
binding sites (b1, b2, 5ht1b,  xxxg1110xxx ), icyp seems
unsuitable for imaging of b-adrenoceptors in the cns.

5. conclusion
five new radiotracers with high affinity for b-adrenoceptors and moderately high lipophilicity have been
synthesized. cerebral uptake of these radioligands was
either very low or the regional distribution of radioactivity did not correspond to that of b-adrenoceptors.
some radioligands (pin, icyp) did display specific
binding in the lung and heart. although affinity and
lipophilicity are often used to predict the suitability of a
compound for in vivo imaging, these criteria proved
insufficient to ensure visualization of b-adrenoceptors
in the brain.
