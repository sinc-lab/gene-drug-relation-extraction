abstract: the thermal stability of rabbit skeletal muscle  xxxg1908xxx  was characterized
using enzymological inactivation studies, differential scanning calorimetry, and analytical ultracentrifugation.
the results suggest that denaturation proceeds by the dissociative mechanism, i.e., it includes the step of
reversible dissociation of the active dimer into inactive monomers and the following step of irreversible
denaturation of the monomer. it was shown that glucose 1-phosphate (substrate), glucose (competitive
inhibitor), amp (allosteric activator), fmn, and  xxxd1292xxx  (allosteric inhibitors) had a protective
effect. calorimetric study demonstrates that the cofactor of glycogen phosphorylasespyridoxal 5′phosphatesstabilizes the enzyme molecule. partial reactivation of  xxxg1908xxx  preheated
at 53 °c occurs after cooling of the enzyme solution to 30 °c. the fact that the rate of reactivation
decreases with dilution of the enzyme solution indicates association of inactive monomers into active
dimers during renaturation. the allosteric inhibitor fmn enhances the rate of phosphorylase b reactivation.

one of the most important physicochemical characteristics
of the proteins is their stability at elevated temperatures. the
kinetics of the denaturation of proteins possessing the
quaternary structure has certain peculiarities because the
overall mechanism of denaturation can include the step of
reversible dissociation of the protein oligomer into separate
subunits. for oligomeric proteins undergoing denaturation
through the dissociative mechanism, the shape of kinetic
curves of denaturation varies with variation of the protein
concentration. the dissociative mechanism of thermal denaturation has been demonstrated for glyceraldehydes-3phosphate dehydrogenase from lobster muscle (1), beta-galactosidase from escherichia coli (2) and streptococcus
thermophilus (3), glucosamine 6-phosphate deaminase from
e. coli (4), glutamate dehydrogenase from sulfolobus solfataricus (5) and bovine liver (6), beta-lactoglobulin (7, 8),
nad-kinase from rabbit liver (9), aminoacylase i from
porcine kidney (10), and adenylate kinase from sulfolobus
acidocaldarius (11).
 xxxg1908xxx  is an excellent object for
studying the mechanism of thermal denaturation of oligomeric enzymes, because phosphorylase b is a dimeric enzyme
with its structure as well as the catalytic and regulatory
properties studied in detail. the catalytically active form of
the enzyme is a dimer, whereas monomers (12) and tetramers

(13, 14) are inactive. the dimeric molecule is composed of
two identical subunits (97 000 da) (figure 1) (15). in
addition to the active site including  xxxd3047xxx  as
a cofactor, each subunit also carries a spatially separated
allosteric activatory site (for binding of amp) close to the
contact between subunits, and an allosteric inhibitory site
inside the subunit globule in the area of the contact of nand c-domains. the adenine moiety of amp is sandwiched
between the aromatic ring of tyr-75 (from r-2-helix) and
the side chain of val-45′ (from the cap of the neighboring
subunit). various heterocyclic compounds, including adenine,
adenosine, flavins, and  xxxd404xxx , are bound at the inhibitory
site. the binding site for  xxxd1292xxx , which acts
as an inhibitor, partly overlaps with the site for amp binding.
the glucose ring stacks against the side chain of trp-67 (the
two rings are nearly perpendicular) and the o2 hydroxyl
forms a good hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of
val-40′. both o1 and o5 are involved in an interaction with
arg-193 (16).
the goal of the present work was to study the mechanism
of thermal denaturation of  xxxg1908xxx  and
the influence of specific ligands on this process using the
data on thermal inactivation kinetics, analytical ultracentrifugation, and differential scanning calorimetry (dsc).1 the
ability of the enzyme to reactivation was also investigated.

phosphorylase b preparation. phosphorylase b was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle according to the method
described by fisher and krebs (17), using dithiotreitol instead
of cysteine. preparations of the enzyme recrystallized four
times and freed of amp were used in the experiments.
phosphorylase b preparations were stored at -20 °c in
beta-glycerophosphate-naoh-buffer, ph 6.8, containing 50%
glycerol and 0.03 m  xxxd26xxx . phosphorylase b
concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using
absorbance index a1% of 13.2 at 280 nm (18).
phosphorylase b assay. the activity of phosphorylase b
in the direction of glycogen synthesis was determined by
the turbidimetric method proposed in our paper (19). the
increase in the optical absorbance of glycogen solution was
registered at 360 nm using a hitachi-557 spectrophotometer
(japan) equipped with a thermostated cell holder with 1-cm
optical path length cuvettes. the activity measurements were
carried out at 30 °c in 0.08 m hepes-naoh buffer, ph 6.8.
phosphorylase b concentration in the reaction mixture was
10 µg/ml. to calculate the initial rate of phosphorylase
reaction, the linear parts of the kinetic curves were used (for
the native enzyme the linearity is retained for 5 min).
preparation of apoform and reduced form of phosphorylase b. apophosphorylase b was prepared according to
shaltiel et al. (20). reconstitution of phosphorylase b was
carried out by addition of equimolar quantities of plp into
the solution of apophosphorylase b (21). reduction of
phosphorylase b by sodium borohydride was carried out
according to (22, 23).
thermal inactivation and reactivation of phosphorylase
b. to study the kinetics of thermal inactivation of phosphorylase b at elevated temperatures (80 mm hepes-naoh, ph
6.8), the enzyme solution was placed into the thermostated
bath, and temperature was maintained with accuracy (0.05

°c. enzyme aliquots were withdrawn from the solution at
fixed intervals. enzyme activity was determined by the
addition of the enzyme solution to the reaction mixture
preincubated at 30 °c.
to study the reactivation of phosphorylase b preheated at
51 or 53 °c, the enzyme solution was cooled to 30 °c, and
then aliquots were withdrawn from the cooled solution at
certain time intervals to determine the enzymatic activity.
analytical ultracentrifugation. sedimentation of phosphorylase b was studied using an analytical ultracentrifuge
spinco, model e (beckman), equipped with a photoelectric
scanner, a multiplexer, and a monochromator. we used a
titanium rotor an-f-ti and double-sector cells with 12-mm
charcoal-filled epon centerpieces in the sedimentation experiments. the rotor speed was 44000-60000 rpm. scanning
was carried out at the wavelengths 290 and 280 nm. the
sedimentation velocity studies were performed at 49-53 °c
(80 mm hepes-naoh, ph 6.8). the cell with the enzyme
solution was placed into the rotor preheated to the required
temperature and optical absorbance was registered after
different times of incubation. the first registration was
carried out during rotor acceleration at low rotor speed (3000
rpm) after 5-min incubation of the enzyme.
the sedimentation coefficient was normalized to the
standard conditions (a solvent with the density and viscosity
of water at 20 °c) using the equation

calorimetric studies. calorimetric measurements were
carried out on a differential scanning adiabatic microcalorimeter dasm-4 (npo “biopribor”, russian academy of
sciences) with the capillary platinum cells (an operating

phosphorylase b solution in 30 mm hepes-koh buffer, ph
7.0, was placed into the cell and heated from 20 to 80 °c
with the certain rate (the typical rate was 1 °c/min).
fitting systems of theoretical equations to dsc data was
carried out using the commercial software “scientist” (micromath scientific software).
results
kinetics of thermal inactivation of  xxxg1908xxx . as was shown by us previously (25), at the
relatively low concentrations of phosphorylase b (lower than
0.1 mg/ml), protein denaturation on the surface of the tube
contributed substantially to the overall process of denaturation. therefore, the study of the kinetics of thermal
inactivation of phosphorylase b was carried out at the enzyme
concentrations higher than 1 mg/ml.

enzyme (53 °c). first, it should be noted that variation in
the concentration of phosphorylase b causes the change in
the rate of enzyme thermal inactivation: it proceeds faster
when the enzyme concentration decreases. a similar picture
was observed for thermal inactivation of a number of other
enzymes (5, 26, 27) and is generally interpreted as an
evidence for the dissociative mechanism of denaturation. this
mechanism involves the step of reversible dissociation of
the enzyme oligomer into subunits, the latter being essentially
more labile than the original oligomer of the enzyme.
it is also noteworthy that at rather high concentrations of
phosphorylase b, the lag period is observed on the thermal
inactivation curves (figure 2a; [e]0 ) 5.2 mg/ml). the lag
period becomes more pronounced as the temperature decreases. as is seen from figure 2b, at lower temperature,
namely at 51 °c, the lag period is well marked both at [e]0
) 1.6 and [e]0 ) 5.2 mg/ml. in the framework of the
dissociative mechanism of denaturation of oligomeric enzymes, the lag period on the thermoinactivation curves
appears because the initial stage of denaturation is a
reversible conformational transition of the enzyme oligomer,
which proceeds without change in the catalytic properties
of the enzyme.
study of phosphorylase b thermal stability by dsc.
thermal denaturation of phosphorylase b was calorimetrically
irreversible because no thermal effect was observed at
reheating scans. moreover, the main parameters of dsc
curve, namely, the maximum value of the excess heat
capacity (∆cp,max) and temperature corresponding to ∆cp,max
(tm), were dependent on the scanning rate and protein
concentration, as it is demonstrated in table 1. the fact that
tm is a function of the scanning rate testifies to the kinetic
control of denaturation of phosphorylase b (28). the fact
that tm and ∆cp,max are the functions of the protein concentration can be explained by the existence of the step of
reversible dissociation in the process of thermal denaturation.
sanchez-ruiz (28) studied theoretically the model of
thermal denaturation of an oligomeric protein including the
step of reversible dissociation of the protein into monomers
and the step of irreversible denaturation of the monomers:

assuming that the irreversible step is rate limited (k2 ,
k1, k-1 [e1]) and the equilibrium at the first step is shifted
toward the oligomer (k ) k1/k-1 , ct; ct is the total
concentration of the protein), sanchez-ruiz has showed that
tm on dsc curves is shifted toward higher temperatures with
increase in the protein concentration. the results of the

biochemistry, vol. 39, no. 43, 2000 13147

thermal stability studies of glucosamine 6-phosphate deaminase from e. coli, which exists as a hexamer in solution (4),
provide support for this prediction: the shift of the maximum
from 57 to 66 °c was observed when the enzyme concentration increased from 0.61 to 7.3 mg/ml.
the data presented in table 1 and figure 3 show that an
increase in phosphorylase b concentration from 0.3 to 6 mg/
ml shifts the position of ∆cp maximum from 57.9 to 59.0
°c. this shift is small in comparison with the theoretical
prediction by sanchez-ruiz and the case of glucosamine
6-phosphate deaminase. it is of special interest that the
increase in phosphorylase b concentration results in the
significant increase of the ∆cp,max value.
the assumptions made by sanchez-ruiz are not probably
valid for thermal denaturation of phosphorylase b. therefore
we have used the general case of the model (2) where all
three rate constants should be taken into account. we assume
that these constants change with temperature according to
the arrhenius equation: k ) exp{ea(1/t* - 1/t)/r} (ea is
the energy of activation, r is the gas constant, and t* is the
absolute temperature at which the rate constant equals 1
min-1).
the kinetic behavior of the system following the model
(2) is described by the system of differential equations:

capacity is expressed as

(4)
vct

where ∆h1 and ∆h2 are enthalpies of the first and second
steps. the total enthalpy change for protein denaturation is
equal to ∆h1 + 2∆h2.
we have carried out fitting of the system of eqs 3 and 4
simultaneously to three dsc curves obtained at various
protein concentrations. figure 3 shows that two experimental
curves (at protein concentration of 3 and 6 mg/ml) coincide
very well with the theoretical curves. some deviations are
observed when comparing the third curve (at protein
concentration of 0.5 mg/ml) with the theoretical curve. the
coefficient of determination characterizing the accuracy of
fitting was 0.993. the values of parameters obtained are
shown in table 2.
thus, the model of dissociative denaturation represented
by the kinetic eq 2 allows us to describe satisfactorily the
main peculiarities of dsc profiles obtained at various
concentrations of phosphorylase b: the relatively small shift
of tm and simultaneously rather marked change in the ∆cp,max
value at variation of the enzyme concentration.

s at [e]0 ) 2.5 mg/ml (figure 4d) to 5.5 s at [e]0 ) 0.3
mg/ml (figure 4a). the sedimentation coefficient, s20, w,
for the native dimeric form of phosphorylase b was estimated
to be 8.2 s. as for the monomeric form of phosphorylase b,
it is known that the sedimentation coefficient for the
monomeric form of apoenzyme is equal to 4.9-5.3 s (29).
the decrease in the sedimentation coefficient for the quickly
sedimenting boundary with decreasing the enzyme concentration can be explained assuming a rapid equilibrium
between the dimeric and monomeric forms of the enzyme.
actually, in this case both forms sediment as a single
boundary with a sedimentation coefficient close to the
weight-average value (30, 31). dilution of the enzyme
solution should result in increasing the proportion of the
monomeric form and consequently diminishing the sedimentation coefficient value. the slowly sedimenting boundary with s20,w equal to 4.4-5.4 s (figure 4) probably
corresponds to the irreversibly denatured form of the
monomer. in addition, the upper parts of the sedimentation
velocity profiles (figure 4, panels a and b) are indicative
of the presence of aggregates. thus, the sedimentation data
support the dissociative mechanism of thermal denaturation
of phosphorylase b.
study of the reversibility of thermal inactivation of
phosphorylase b. the possibility of reactivation of the heated
enzyme by subsequent cooling due to reassociation of
inactive monomers into active oligomers has been shown
for several oligomeric enzymes, e.g., for acid phosphatase

from aspergillus terreus (32). it was of special interest to
study the possibility of reactivation of phosphorylase b after
heating of the enzyme during different time intervals.
as illustrated in figure 5a, the enzymatic activity of
phosphorylase b preincubated at 53 °c during different time
intervals is partly recovered after cooling of the solution to
30 °c. for the enzyme preheated for 15 min when its activity
decreases to 85% compared to the initial level, the activity
is recovered up to 93% after cooling. in the sample preheated
for 22 min, the activity after cooling is recovered from 70
to 80%. after heating of the enzyme solution for 30 min,
no reactivation is observed. thus, under these conditions
denaturation becomes completely irreversible.
to understand the mechanism of reactivation of phosphorylase b, the initial enzyme solution (5.2 mg/ml) was
preheated at 51 °c for 30 min and the kinetics of the activity
recovery was registered at various enzyme concentrations:

kurganov et al.

reactivation was studied at 30 °c. the dotted line corresponds to
the thermoinactivation curve of phosphorylase b at 53 °c. enzyme
concentration was 5.2 mg/ml (80 mm hepes-naoh, ph 6.8). (b)
effect of the protein concentration on the kinetics of reactivation
of phosphorylase b at 30 °c. the enzyme solution (5.2 mg/ml)
was preheated at 51 °c for 30 min. reactivation was carried out at
the following enzyme concentrations: 1.3 mg/ml (squares), 2.6
mg/ml (circles), and 5.2 mg/ml (triangles). the dotted line
corresponds to the thermal inactivation curve of phosphorylase b
(5.2 mg/ml) at 51 °c.

5.2 mg/ml (without dilution), 2.6 (2-fold diluted solution),
and 1.3 mg/ml (4-fold diluted solution) (figure 5b). if
reactivation results from reassociation of two inactive
monomers into an active dimer, then the rate of the activity
recovery should decrease with dilution of phosphorylase b
solution, because the rate of reassociation of two inactive
monomers into an active dimer (as the rate of a bimolecular
reaction) is proportional to the square of the monomer
concentration. in fact, the dilution results in slowing of the
reactivation process. thus, it is believed that from the kinetic
point of view reactivation is mainly determined by irreversible association of monomers into dimer.
influence of specific ligands on thermodenaturation and
reactivation of phosphorylase b. figure 6 shows the effect
of specific ligands on the temperature dependence of
phosphorylase b excess heat capacity (∆cp). in the absence
of ligands, the excess heat capacity vs temperature curve is
asymmetric, with temperature maximum positioned at 56.8
°c. for all the ligands tested, used in the concentrations close
to the saturating ones, the temperature maximum of the

curves increases in the following order: 57.4 °c for the
substrate glucose 1-phosphate, 58.1 °c for the allosteric
activator amp, 58.3 °c for the competitive inhibitor glucose,
59.1 °c for the allosteric inhibitor  xxxd1292xxx , and
59.6 °c for the allosteric inhibitor fmn. the maximal
protective effect was observed for fmn.
it should be noted that the protective effect of amp is
not disturbed by possible formation of tetramer, because the
control sedimentation experiments (not illustrated) testify to
absence of the tetrameric form at temperatures higher than
45 °c (at the enzyme concentration 5.2 mg/ml).
the character of the thermal inactivation curves at 53 °c
in the presence of fmn, amp, and  xxxd1292xxx  is
substantially different from that without ligands (figure 7).
as is seen from the figure, the duration of the lag period is
markedly increased in the presence of each ligand, i.e., the
ligands studied interfere with the reversible predenaturational
conformational changes in the dimeric molecule of phosphorylase b. the most pronounced effect at this step was

detected for fmn. surprisingly, after sufficient length of time
(t > 100 min) the rate of inactivation in the presence of fmn
appears to be substantially higher than that in the presence
of amp or  xxxd1292xxx .
the slow of phosphorylase b inactivation at high values
of time in the presence of amp and  xxxd1292xxx  is
probably due to ability of these ligands to interfere with
dissociation of dimer into monomers. this suggestion was
supported by the sedimentation experiments. during the
sedimentation studies of phosphorylase b (0.57 mg/ml) at
49 °c, we observed two boundaries, one of which corresponds to the dimeric form with s20,w ) 7.9 s and the other
which corresponds to the monomeric form with s20,w ) 5.8
s (figure 8a). however, only one boundary with s20,w )
8.0 s was observed on the sedimentation patterns obtained
in the presence of 1 mm amp (figure 8b).
figure 9 shows the effect of specific ligands on reactivation
of phosphorylase b preheated at 51 °c for 30 min. as can
be seen from the figure, the kinetic curve of reactivation
obtained in the absence of ligands coincides with that
obtained in the presence of amp or  xxxd1292xxx .
this means that amp and  xxxd1292xxx  do not affect
the rate of the reactivation process. however, in the presence
of 2 mm fmn, a pronounced acceleration of reactivation is
observed. it is noteworthy that none of the ligands influenced
the maximum degree of the enzymatic activity recovery.
role of plp in stabilization of the phosphorylase b
molecule. to characterize the role of cofactor of phosphorylase b, plp, in sustaining the native conformation of the
enzyme, we carried out a comparative analysis of thermal
stability of the native phosphorylase b (holoform) and its
apoform using dsc. as can be seen from figure 10, a
maximum on the ∆cp vs temperature profile for the apoform
of phosphorylase b (48 °c) is shifted markedly toward lower

°c). thermostability of the reconstituted enzyme (curve c)
is practically identical to that for the native enzyme. it is
known that removal of plp from phosphorylase b results in
dissociation of the dimeric form into monomers (29, 33).
therefore, one can assume that the main reason for the lesser
stability of the apoform of the enzyme is its being in the
monomeric state. nevertheless, it is evident that plp has a
general stabilizing effect on the conformation of the native
phosphorylase b.
in the phosphorylase b molecule, plp is bound by
aldimine bond with lys-680. the study of thermal stability
of modified phosphorylase b where aldimine bond is reduced
by sodium borohydride gives an additional verification of
participation of plp in stabilization of the native enzyme
molecule. as is seen from figure 11, thermal inactivation
of phosphorylase b reduced by sodium borohydride proceeds
much faster in comparison with the native enzyme. the
following two circumstances are worth mentioning. first, the

character of the thermal inactivation curves for the reduced
phosphorylase b, as for the native form, depends on the
protein concentration: dilution of the enzyme solution results
in acceleration of thermal inactivation. thus, denaturation
of the reduced form of phosphorylase b proceeds according
to the dissociative mechanism. second, although the kinetic
curve of thermal inactivation of the native enzyme at the
concentration 5.2 mg/ml has a well-pronounced lag period,
after reduction of the enzyme by sodium borohydride no lag
period occurs (figure 11). the disappearance of lag period
on the curves of thermal inactivation for the reduced form
of phosphorylase b indicates that thermal denaturation of this
form does not include the step of predenaturational conformational changes in the dimer. it is known that reduction of
phosphorylase b by sodium borohydride causes substantial
weakening of the intersubunit contacts in the dimer. the
reduced phosphorylase b can partially dissociate into monomers even at 30 °c at relatively low enzyme concentrations
(0.01 mg/ml) (33).
sedimentation analysis of nabh4-reduced phosphorylase
b (0.92 mg/ml) at 53 °c (figure 12) indicates that at
sedimentation times used the reduced enzyme form moves
as an unfolded monomer (s20,w ) 3.6 s). thus, at elevated
temperatures nabh4-reduced phosphorylase b dissociates
more easily than the native enzyme (cf. figure 4).

1 °c/min.

the lower stability of sodium borohydride reduced phosphorylase b, as compared to the native enzyme, was also
supported by dsc data. as seen from figure 13, the
maximum on the ∆cp vs temperature profile for the reduced
form of phosphorylase b occurs at 54.2 °c, i.e., at a lower
temperature than for the native enzyme (57.0 °c).
discussion
the distinctive characteristics of the kinetics of thermal
inactivation of oligomeric enzymes are the change in the
shape of kinetic curves upon variation in the enzyme
concentration and the appearance of lag period on the initial
part of kinetic curves. the general kinetic scheme of the
process of dissociative thermal inactivation of oligomeric
enzymes has the following appearance (10, 34).

for the sake of simplicity, we have assumed that the
original oligomeric form of the enzyme is a dimer e2.
according to the scheme under discussion, the enzyme
oligomer undergoes reversible conformational changes with
formation of the enzyme forms e(i)
2 (1 e i e m) retaining
the catalytic activity. the loss of the enzyme activity is
connected with dissociation of the conformationally changed
enzyme form e(m)
2 into the inactive monomers (e1) undergoing further denaturation (e1 f eden). the denatured
monomers usually tend to aggregate, and because of this the
process of denaturation becomes irreversible.
thus, in the scheme under discussion protein denaturation
occurs only after the dissociation of the oligomer into the
less stable subunits. in turn, the dissociation of the oligomer
into subunits is possible only after a series of conformational
transitions in the oligomer structure. when explaining the
sequence of the conformational changes in the enzyme

biochemistry, vol. 39, no. 43, 2000 13151
oligomer, poltorak et al. (10, 34) postulated that the
intersubunit contact in the oligomer consists of discrete
subcontacts, disruption of which occurs in a certain order.
in the dimeric molecule of muscle phosphorylase b, there
are two regions of contact between subunits: one subcontact
is located between caps and the other is formed by tower
helices of the neighboring subunits (figure 1). the appearance of lag period on kinetic curves of thermal inactivation
of muscle phosphorylase b can be explained assuming that
the subcontacts differ in stability and their disruption
proceeds in a consecutive manner. thus, the conformationally
changed form of the dimer in eq 5 may be the dimer with
partially disrupted bonds between subunits. the rupture of
one of the subcontacts in the dimeric enzyme facilitates its
further dissociation into monomers. the monomers formed
undergo irreversible denaturation.
the kinetic scheme of thermal denaturation of muscle
phosphorylase b proposed by us has the following form:

where e2 is the native dimeric form of the enzyme and e/2 is
the conformationally changed dimeric form of the enzyme
(probably a dimer in which one of the subcontacts is
disrupted). the presence of the reversible step of dissociation
e/2 a  xxxd851xxx  is supported by the fact that the shape of the
kinetic curves of thermoinactivation of phosphorylase b is
changed with variation of the enzyme concentration, as well
as by the data on dsc and analytical ultracentrifugation
studies. the presence of reversible pre-denaturation step e2
a e/2 is supported by the fact that the lag period is observed
on the thermal inactivation curves.
equation 2, which does not include the pre-denaturation
step has been successfully fitted to dsc profiles obtained
at various protein concentration. however, there are some
deviations between the experimental and theoretical curves.
probably, these deviations are due to the fact that the model
used is simplified. it should be noted, that eq 6 is very
complex for fitting: it includes 11 varied parameters instead
of 7 for eq 2.
the proposed kinetic scheme of the thermal denaturation
of phosphorylase b includes the formation of one catalytically
active intermediate, namely, the dimeric form e/2. in fact,
the disruption of contacts between tower helices and caps
could proceed stepwise, and therefore formation of several
intermediates is possible.
when interpreting the effect of specific ligands on the
kinetics of thermoinactivation or reactivation of phosphorylase b, we should take into account that the process of
denaturation involves the reversible association-dissociation
step d a 2m, whereas the reactivation process studied at
30 °c is an irreversible bimolecular reaction 2m f d. the
fact that amp and  xxxd1292xxx  are bound in the
region of the subunit contact in the dimeric phosphorylase
b molecule explains the ability of these ligands to interfere
with dissociation of the dimer into monomers. one can
expect that the monomer is unable to bind amp or glucose
6-phosphate (or the affinity to these ligands is rather low).
that is why the reactivation process is unaffected by amp

13152 biochemistry, vol. 39, no. 43, 2000
and  xxxd1292xxx . since the fmn-binding site is
located in the cleft between two domains of the subunit, it
is likely that the monomeric form retains the affinity to fmn.
in this respect, it is worth noting that the apoform of
phosphorylase b, which exists as a monomer retains the
capability for binding of fmn, though the dissociation
constant for the apoform-fmn complex is substantially less
than the corresponding value for the native enzyme-fmn
complex [by a factor of 27 (21)]. the stimulating action of
fmn on reactivation is probably due to fmn-induced
conformational changes in monomers, which favor their
association to the dimer.
phosphorylase b cofactor, plp, is buried in the center of
the enzyme molecule at the site, which is situated approximately 1.5 nm from the surface of the enzyme molecule.
plp interacts with the amino acid residues which belong to
both domains of the polypeptide chain of the monomer. it
is exactly this type of cofactor binding that explains its
capability to stabilize the conformation of the native enzyme.
very noticeable is the fact that the reduction of the
aldimine bond between plp and lys-680 causes disappearance of the lag period on the kinetic curves of thermoinactivation. this means that in the reduced form of
phosphorylase b the intersubunit contact is strongly weakened. therefore, thermal denaturation of the reduced form
of phosphorylase b follows the simple dissociative mechanism described by eq 2.
thus, our data show that thermal denaturation of skeletal
muscle phosphorylase b proceeds according to the dissociative mechanism. the overall mechanism of denaturation
involves the stages of predenaturational conformational
changes of the dimeric enzyme molecule, dissociation of
catalytically active dimers into inactive monomers, and,
finally, irreversible denaturation of isolated monomers.
