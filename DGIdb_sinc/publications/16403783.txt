abstract
it is widely believed that the potencies of nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) as
inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (cox) are influenced by protein binding in the extracellular fluid,
since nsaids are bound to circulating albumin by well over 95%. this is an important point
because the protein concentrations in synovial fluid and the central nervous system, which are
sites of nsaid action, are markedly different from those in plasma. here we have used a
modified whole-blood assay to compare the potencies of aspirin, celecoxib, diclofenac,
indomethacin,  xxxd2517xxx ,  xxxd2561xxx , naproxen, rofecoxib,  xxxd3219xxx , and sc560 as
inhibitors of cox-1 and cox-2 in the presence of differing concentrations of protein. the
potencies of diclofenac, naproxen, rofecoxib, and salicylate, but not aspirin, celecoxib,
indomethacin,  xxxd2517xxx ,  xxxd2561xxx , or sc560, against cox-1 (human platelets) increased as
protein concentrations were reduced. varying protein concentrations did not affect the potencies
of any of the drugs against cox-2, with the exception of  xxxd3219xxx  (a549 cells). clearly,
our findings show that the selectivity of inhibitors for cox-1 and cox-2, which are taken to be
linked to their efficacy and side effects, may change in different extracellular fluid conditions. in
particular, selectivity in one body compartment does not demonstrate selectivity in another.
thus, whole-body safety or toxicity cannot be linked to one definitive measure of cox
selectivity.

onsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are the world’s most widely used class of
therapeutic drugs. members of this class of drugs owe their anti-inflammatory and
analgesic properties to inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (cox). however, the
use of nsaids is also associated with gastrointestinal, and more recently, cardiovascular side
effects (see refs 1–4). the gastrointestinal side effects of nsaids appear to be associated with

page 1 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

the relative potency of each nsaid for cox-1 over cox-2 (4–6) such that they are lessened in
compounds that are more highly cox-2-selective. the associations between cox-1 and -2
selectivity and cardiovascular side effects are still under debate. however, the particular
relationships between the potencies of each class member of the nsaids for cox-1 and -2 in
different biological systems are not know, and it has become increasingly important that we
understand all aspects of the pharmacology of individual nsaids. in making such comparisons,
it has been taken for granted that the activities of the nsaids are affected similarly by the
presence of plasma proteins—since nsaids are known to be heavily protein bound and free
drug to be the most important determinant of inhibitory activity. aside from technical
considerations and implications for drug pharmacokinetics, it is also important to consider that
protein concentrations differ in the fluid present in different compartments of the body. of
particular relevance to the nsaids, the protein concentrations in synovial fluid and the central
nervous system are different from those in plasma. here, therefore, we have simply compared
the potencies of cox inhibitors in the presence of the differing concentrations of protein present
in blood, synovial fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid by modifying previously reported whole-blood
assays of cox activity.
materials and methods
materials
all compounds used were obtained from sigma (poole, uk) unless otherwise stated. celecoxib,
 xxxd2517xxx ,  xxxd2561xxx , rofecoxib, and sc560 were gifts from boehringer ingelheim pharma
kg. for the radioimmunoassays, antisera to 6-keto-prostaglandin f1alpha and thromboxane b2 were
obtained from sigma; [3h]-6-keto-prostaglandin f1alpha and [3h]-thromboxane b2 were purchased
from amersham (little chalfont, uk).
assays of cox activity
as an indicator of the activity of cox-1, the production of thromboxane (tx) a2 by platelets
was used; for cox-2 activity, the production of pge2 by a549 cells preincubated with
interleukin-1beta was used (6–8). for cox-1 assays, whole blood or washed platelets suspended in
 xxxd3213xxx ’ buffer containing either 35 mg/ml bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) (equivalent to synovial
fluid) or 0.35 mg/ml bsa (equivalent to cerebrospinal fluid) were incubated (37°c) with test
agents (all 10−10 to 10−3 m) or vehicle (0.1% v/v  xxxd1896xxx ) for 60 min followed by the
addition of calcium ionophore, a23187 (50 µm). after a further 30 min incubation, the samples
were centrifuged (1500 g, 4°c, 5 min) and the incubation medium was removed and immediately
frozen. concentrations of txb2 (as a measure of txa2 formation and so cox activity) in
samples were then determined by radioimmunoassay. for cox-2 assays, a549 cells were
incubated (37°c) in whole blood or  xxxd3213xxx ’ buffer plus 35 or 0.35 mg/ml bsa with test agents
or vehicle for 60 min followed by the addition of calcium ionophore, a23187 (50 µm). after a
further 30 min incubation, the samples were centrifuged (1500 g, 4°c, 5 min) and the incubation
medium was removed and immediately frozen. concentrations of pge2 were then determined by
radioimmunoassay.

data analysis
data are expressed as mean ± se of separate determinations as specified in individual figure
legends. unless otherwise stated, statistical analyses were performed by applying a one-way
anova followed by a tukey-kramer post test. p < 0.05 indicated a statistical difference. all
graphs and analyses were by prism 4.00 (graphpad).
results
basal cox activities
under control conditions, the concentrations of txb2 produced by platelets in whole blood, or
washed platelets in pbs containing 35 mg/ml or 0.35 mg/ml bsa, were 29 ± 2 ng ml–1, 31 ± 2
ng ml–1 or 29 ± 2 ng ml–1, respectively (n=12). the concentrations of pge2 produced from the
a549 cells were 42 ± 4 ng ml–1, 33 ± 3 ng ml–1, or 31 ± 4 ng ml–1, respectively (n=12).
effects of aspirin, celecoxib, indomethacin,  xxxd2517xxx ,  xxxd2561xxx , and sc560
aspirin, celecoxib, indomethacin,  xxxd2517xxx ,  xxxd2561xxx , and sc560 inhibited cox-1 in
platelets, indicated by changes in the production of txa2, with the different concentrations of
protein having no effect on the ic50 values (fig. 1 and 2; table 1). the potencies of these drugs
as inhibitors of cox-2 activity were also unaffected by the presence of differing concentrations
of protein (fig. 1 and 2; table 2).
effects of diclofenac, naproxen, and rofecoxib
the potencies of diclofenac, naproxen, and rofecoxib against cox-1 increased as the
concentration of protein was decreased (fig. 3 and 4; table 1). for diclofenac and naproxen, the
ic50 values in 0.35 mg/ml bsa were >10-fold lower than ic50 values derived from experiments
conducted in whole blood (fig. 3). no statistical differences were found between inhibitor curves
for the three compounds against production of pge2 dependent upon cox-2 in a549 cells,
when experiments were performed in whole blood vs. media plus 35 mg/ml or 0.35 mg/ml bsa
(fig. 3 and 4; table 2).
effects of  xxxd3219xxx 
the potency of  xxxd3219xxx  against cox-1 increased as the concentration of protein was
decreased (fig. 5; table 1) such that the ic50 value in 0.35 mg/ml bsa was >10-fold lower than
the ic50 value derived from experiments conducted in whole blood.  xxxd3219xxx  was also
the only drug tested that demonstrated an increase in potency against cox-2 when the
concentration of protein was decreased (fig. 5; table 2) such that the ic50 value in 0.35 mg/ml
bsa was almost 10-fold lower than that derived from experiments conducted in whole blood.
relative effects of differing incubation media on cox-1 vs. cox-2 selectivity
calculated ic50 ratios for the inhibitors tested (table 3) demonstrated that varying protein
concentrations influenced the relative potencies of the drugs tested. diclofenac was the most

affected, showing a 34-fold increase in cox-1 selectivity between 0.35 mg/ml bsa and whole
blood.
discussion
here we show in two simple assay systems that the potencies of a range of nsaids are
differently influenced by the presence of protein, with the strongest effects being shown against
cox-1. this has important ramifications since it means the selectivity of nsaids for cox-1 vs.
cox-2 will vary depending on their different chemical structures and their presence in different
body compartments.
the protein concentration of plasma is ∼70 mg/ml, whereas that in synovial fluid is some 50–
80% lower, depending upon disease state, and cerebrospinal fluid is an ultrafiltrate with very low
protein levels, <1% of that in plasma (9, 10). the concentrations of bsa we have chosen
therefore offer simple model systems equating to the environment within the blood compartment,
joints and the central nervous system sites, at which nsaids are believed to be active (4). the
potency of aspirin was unaffected by the concentrations of protein present in the incubation
media. this may well be because aspirin is a noncompetitive inhibitor of both cox-1 and cox2 acting to irreversibly acetylate serine residue 530 (11–14). thus, as there is not competition
between free drug and substrate, protein binding of drug may have little impact. sodium
salicylate makes a good test of this hypothesis, since it is chemically very similar to aspirin but
acts upon cox as a weak competitive inhibitor, as shown in in vitro assay systems very similar
to that used here (8). here we found  xxxd3219xxx  to increase in potency as protein levels in
the incubation medium were reduced, consistent with an increased concentration of free drug
competing with substrate. this could provide an explanation for some of the therapeutic utility of
salicylates, in that because of their sensitivity to protein binding, they work preferentially at sites
of lower protein concentration such as found within joints.
of the other drugs tested, a complex picture was seen, although for none of these agents were
changes in protein concentration associated with any effects upon potency against cox-2. some
of these other drugs tested are understood to be competitive inhibitors of cox-1 (11–14) and so
increases in free drug, that is, reductions in protein binding, may well produce increased activity
and leftward shifts of the inhibitor curves as substrate is more readily competed away from the
active site of the enzyme, as was seen for diclofenac. indomethacin binds tightly to both cox-1
and cox-2, producing inhibition that is largely independent of assay conditions (14) consistent
with the lack of effect of protein concentrations we found here. naproxen has previously been
shown to be a competitive inhibitor of cox-1 but to bind in a weak, pseudo-irreversible manner
to cox-2 (14). this is consistent with our observations here, as naproxen’s potency against
cox-1 but not cox-2 was influenced by protein concentration in the incubation medium.
similarly,  xxxd2561xxx  has been shown to bind like naproxen in a weak, pseudo-irreversible
manner to both cox-1 and cox-2, once again consistent with our observations.
in conclusion, our studies demonstrate that protein binding differently affects the activities of a
range of nsaids against cox-1 and cox-2. this may well be explained by different kinetics
of interaction between the inhibitors and the two cox isoforms. as aspirin and indomethacin
showed on cox-1 and cox-2, if a drug is an irreversible or slowly reversible cox inhibitor,
then protein binding seems to have little effect. this may be explained if the dissociation of the

page 4 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

drug from the cox enzyme is slower than that of the drug from the binding proteins; that is,
under these conditions inhibitor molecules will always be present to bind to the cox enzyme. in
comparison,  xxxd3219xxx , which is a competitive inhibitor of both cox-1 and cox-2, is
affected by the presence of protein as its dissociation from the cox enzyme is much more rapid.
clearly, our findings show that the selectivities of inhibitors for cox-1 and cox-2, which are
taken to be linked to their efficacy and side effects, change in different extracellular fluid
conditions. in particular, selectivity in one body compartment cannot be taken as evidence of
selectivity in another body compartment, and whole-body safety or toxicity cannot be linked to
one definitive measure of cox selectivity. thus, these observations are extremely relevant to
ongoing discussions regarding the safety of nsaids.
