abstract
 xxxd1762xxx , a purified proanthocyanidin oligomer extracted
from the bark latex of croton lechleri, is in clinical trials for
secretory diarrheas of various etiologies. we investigated the
antisecretory mechanism of  xxxd1762xxx  by determining its effect on the major apical membrane transport and signaling
processes involved in intestinal fluid transport. using cell lines
and measurement procedures to isolate the effects on individual membrane transport proteins,  xxxd1762xxx  at 50 ␮m had little
or no effect on the activity of epithelial na⫹ or k⫹ channels or
on camp or calcium signaling.  xxxd1762xxx  inhibited the cystic
fibrosis transmembrane regulator (cftr) cl⫺ channel with
maximum inhibition of ⬃60% and an ic50 ⬃7 ␮m.  xxxd1762xxx 

secretory diarrhea remains a global health challenge in
developing and developed countries. intestinal fluid secretion involves cl⫺ influx into enterocytes through an na⫹/k⫹/
2cl⫺ symporter on the basolateral membrane and cl⫺ efflux
through apical (lumen-facing) cl⫺ channels (barrett and
keely, 2000; field, 2003; thiagarajah and verkman, 2005)
(fig. 1). k⫹ channels and a  xxxd2483xxx ⫹/2k⫹ pump establish the
electrochemical driving force for cl⫺ secretion. na⫹ and water secretion follow passively in response to active cl⫺ secretion. bacterial enterotoxins produced by vibrio cholerae and
escherichia coli elevate cyclic nucleotide concentrations in

action at an extracellular site on cftr produced voltage-independent block with stabilization of the channel closed state.
 xxxd1762xxx  did not affect the potency of glycine  xxxd2396xxx  or
thiazolidinone cftr inhibitors.  xxxd1762xxx  action resisted
washout, with ⬍50% reversal of cftr inhibition after 4 h.
 xxxd1762xxx  was also found to strongly inhibit the intestinal
calcium-activated cl⫺ channel  xxxg162xxx  by a voltage-independent inhibition mechanism with maximum inhibition ⬎90%
and ic50 ⬃6.5 ␮m. the dual inhibitory action of  xxxd1762xxx  on
two structurally unrelated prosecretory intestinal cl⫺ channels
may account for its intestinal antisecretory activity.

enterocytes, resulting in cl⫺ channel activation and fluid
secretion. na⫹ absorption through apical membrane na⫹
channels and electrogenic na⫹-coupled symporters oppose
net fluid secretion. the rate of net intestinal fluid secretion,
and hence the severity of secretory diarrhea, is expected to be
sensitive to modulators of these transporting systems and to
upstream cyclic nucleotide or calcium signaling pathways.
treatment of secretory diarrheas in developing countries
is primarily supportive, involving replacement of intestinal fluid losses using oral rehydration salt solution. although oral rehydration salt has greatly improved clinical
outcome in cholera and other diarrheas, there remains
significant mortality from infectious diarrheas, with recurrent major outbreaks. potential targets for diarrhea therapy to further reduce morbidity and mortality include the
bacteria itself (vaccines, antimicrobials), elaborated enterotoxins and their cellular uptake, cellular cyclic nucleotide signaling, and the prosecretory membrane transporters mentioned above (field, 2003; thiagarajah and
verkman, 2005). our laboratory has focused on targeted
inhibitors of the two principal apical membrane cl⫺ chan-

nels in enterocytes: the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator conductance (cftr), a camp-stimulated cl⫺ channel; and calcium-activated cl⫺ channels (caccs). by highthroughput screening and follow-up chemistry, we
identified inhibitors of these cl⫺ channels, including nanomolar-potency thiazolidinone (ma et al., 2002), glycine  xxxd2396xxx  (muanprasat et al., 2004) and pyrimido-pyrroloquinoxalinedione (tradtrantip et al., 2009a) cftr
inhibitors, and 3-acyl-2-aminothiophene cacc inhibitors
(de la fuente et al., 2008). we have also identified thiophene carboxylate activators of phosphodiesterases that
reduce cyclic nucleotide concentrations and toxin-induced
intestinal fluid secretion (tradtrantip et al.,  xxxd1693xxx ).
here, we investigate the antisecretory mechanism of
 xxxd1762xxx , a purified proanthocyanidin oligomer extracted from the blood-red bark latex of the south american medicinal plant croton lechleri (dragon’s blood). the
sap of c. lechleri has been used in south american countries like ecuador and peru for many years to treat diarrheas, including dysentery and cholera, and various lung,
stomach, and other conditions (ubillas et al., 1994; jones,
2003; risco et al., 2003; rossi et al., 2003). additional
pharmacological studies have shown that  xxxd1762xxx  reduced fluid secretion in cell culture and mouse models
(gabriel et al., 1999).  xxxd1762xxx  is currently in clinical
trials for the treatment of secretory diarrheas associated
with acute infections including cholera, chronic diarrhea
associated with hiv/aids, and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (holodniy et al., 1999; dicesare et
al., 2002; mangel and chaturvedi, 2008). here, we report
that the antisecretory mechanism-of-action of  xxxd1762xxx 
involves inhibition of both cftr and cacc cl⫺ channels
at the luminal membrane of enterocytes.

materials and methods
chemicals.  xxxd1742xxx , apigenin, and  xxxd2388xxx  ( xxxd2388xxx ) were purchased from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo).
8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-camp (cpt-camp) was purchased from calbiochem (san diego, ca). the small-molecule cftr inhibitors
cftrinh-172 and glyh-101, and the cacc inhibitor caccinh-01,
were synthesized as reported previously (ma et al., 2002; muanprasat et al., 2004; de la fuente et al., 2008).  xxxd1762xxx  was provided

see the introduction for a further explanation.

by napo pharmaceuticals inc. (south san francisco, ca).  xxxd1762xxx  was prepared by extraction from the bark latex of c. lechleri.
after chilling the bark latex to induce a phase separation, the solid
residues were discarded, and the supernatant was extracted with
butanol. the  xxxd1762xxx -containing aqueous phase was filtered by
tangential flow and subjected to low-pressure liquid chromatography
on an ion-exchange column. the  xxxd1762xxx -enriched fraction was
purified on a sephadex column, and  xxxd1762xxx  was eluted using a
mobile phase of aqueous acetone.  xxxd1762xxx  was then dried under
vacuum.  xxxd1762xxx  is a proanthocyanidin oligomer with an average
molecular mass of 2100 da, in agreement with a previously reported
average molecular mass of 2300 da (ubillas et al., 1994). figure 2a
shows the putative structure of  xxxd1762xxx . the material used for the
studies here is the same as that used in clinical trials, in which it is
formulated for oral dosing as modified-release tablets (125 or 250 mg
of  xxxd1762xxx  per tablet).
cell culture. fisher rat thyroid (frt) cells expressing human
cftr were generated as described previously (ma et al., 2002). frt
cells expressing human  xxxg162xxx  (cdna provided by dr. luis
galietta, gaslini institute, genoa, italy) were generated similarly.
frt cells were cultured in f-12 modified coon’s medium (sigmaaldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (hyclone, logan, ut), 2 mm glutamine, 100 u/ml penicillin, 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin, 350 ␮g/ml hygromycin, and 500 ␮g/ml  xxxg418xxx  ( xxxd2191xxx ).
primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells were maintained at an air-liquid interface as described previously (yamaya et
al., 1992). t84 cells were cultured in dmem/ham’s f-12 (1:1) medium containing 10% fbs, 100 u/ml penicillin, and 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin. cells were grown on snapwell porous filters (corning life
sciences, lowell, ma) at 37°c in 5% co2/95% air.
short-circuit current measurements. frt cells (stably expressing cftr or  xxxg162xxx ) were cultured on snapwell filters
until confluence (transepithelial resistance ⬎500 ⍀ 䡠 cm). shortcircuit current was measured in ussing chambers (vertical diffusion
chamber; corning life sciences) with ringer’s solution bathing the
basolateral surface and half-ringer’s bathing the apical surface.
ringer’s solution contained 130 mm nacl, 2.7 mm kcl, 1.5 mm
kh2po4, 1 mm cacl2, 0.5 mm mgcl2, 10 mm sodium-hepes, and
10 mm glucose, ph 7.3. half-ringer’s solution was the same, except
that 65 mm nacl was replaced with sodium gluconate, and cacl2
was increased to 2 mm. the basolateral membrane was permeabilized with 250 ␮g/ml  xxxd164xxx , as described previously (ma et
al., 2002). chambers were bubbled continuously with air. for t84
cells and bronchial epithelial cells, cells were bathed in symmetrical
hco3⫺-buffered solution containing 120 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 1 mm
mgcl2, 1 mm cacl2, 10 mm d-glucose, 5 mm hepes, and 25 mm
nahco3, ph 7.4, and aerated with 5% co2 at 37°c. for the measurement of apical k⫹ conductance in t84 cells, nahco3 and nacl
were replaced with sodium gluconate, and sodium gluconate in basolateral solution was replaced with potassium gluconate and bubbled with air. the basolateral membrane was permeabilized with 20
␮m  xxxd164xxx . short-circuit current was measured using a
dvc-1000 voltage-clamp apparatus (world precision instruments,
inc., sarasota, fl).
cyclic nucleotide assays. t84 cells were grown in 24-well
plates, treated for 45 min with  xxxd1762xxx  and then for 10 min with
0 or 20 ␮m  xxxd1742xxx , lysed by sonication, and centrifuged to remove
cell debris, and the supernatant was assayed for camp according to
manufacturer’s instructions (parameter camp immunoassay kit;
r&d systems, minneapolis, mn).
patch-clamp analysis of cftr and  xxxg162xxx  clⴚ channel
function. whole-cell recordings were made on frt cells stably
expressing cftr or  xxxg162xxx . the pipette solution for cftr contained 140 mm n-methyl-d-glucamine chloride (nmdg-cl), 5 mm
egta, 1 mm mgcl2, 1 mm tris-atp, and 10 mm hepes, ph 7.2.
the pipette solution for  xxxg162xxx  contained 130 mm cscl, 0.5 mm
egta, 1 mm mgcl2, 1 mm tris-atp, and 10 mm hepes, ph 7.2.
the bath solution contained 140 mm nmdg-cl, 1 mm cacl2, 1 mm

 xxxd1762xxx  inhibition of chloride channels
mgcl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm hepes, ph 7.4. all measurements were done at room temperature (22–25°c). pipettes were
pulled from borosilicate glass and had resistances of 3 to 5 m⍀ after
fire-polishing. seal resistances were between 3 and 10 g⍀. after
establishing the whole-cell configuration, cftr was activated by
 xxxd1742xxx  and  xxxd2388xxx , and  xxxg162xxx  was activated by atp. wholecell currents were elicited by applying hyperpolarizing and depolarizing voltage pulses from a holding potential of 0 mv to potentials
between ⫺100 and ⫹100 mv in steps of 20 mv. the current output
was filtered at 5 khz. currents were digitized and analyzed using an
axoscope 10.0 system and a digidata 1440a ac/dc converter (molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca).
single-channel analysis of cftr was done in the cell-attached
configuration using fire-polished pipettes with a resistance of 6 to 10
m⍀. the pipette solution contained 140 mm nmdg-cl, 1 mm cacl2,
1 mm mgcl2, 5 mm glucose, and 10 mm hepes, ph 7.4, and the kcl
bath solution contained 140 mm kcl, 1 mm cacl2, 1 mm mgcl2, 5
mm glucose, and 10 mm hepes, ph 7.4. recordings were performed
at room temperature using an axopatch-200b (molecular devices).
voltage and current data were low-pass-filtered at 1 khz and stored
for later analysis. single-channel data were digitally filtered at 25
hz and analyzed using clampfit 10.0 software (molecular devices).

calcium signaling measurements. measurements of [ca2⫹]i in
confluent monolayers of t84 cells were done by loading cells with
fura-2 by 30-min incubation at 37°c with 2 ␮m fura-2-am (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). fura-2-loaded t84 cells were mounted in a
perfusion chamber on the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope. the cells were superfused with 140 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 1
mm mgcl2, 1 mm cacl2, 10 mm d-glucose, and 10 mm hepes, ph
7.4. fura-2 fluorescence was recorded at excitation wavelengths of
340 and 380 nm, and the results were expressed as a 340/380 fluorescence ratio. after obtaining baseline measurements, 100 ␮m atp
was added in the perfusate. measurements were made in the absence and presence of 50 ␮m  xxxd1762xxx .

 xxxd1762xxx  inhibits clⴚ secretion by t84 human
intestinal epithelial cells. to test whether  xxxd1762xxx 
reduces intestinal cell cl⫺ secretion, short-circuit current
was measured in t84 cells in symmetrical physiological solutions (without plasma membrane permeabilization). figure 2b shows  xxxd1762xxx  concentration-dependent inhibition

of the increase in short-circuit current produced by the camp
agonist  xxxd1742xxx  (top) and the calcium agonists atp (middle)
and thapsigargin (bottom). measurements with the calcium
agonists were done in the presence of cftrinh-172 to inhibit
cftr. whereas  xxxd1762xxx  inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -induced
current, which is mainly cftr-dependent, was slow, weak,
and partial, inhibition of atp and thapsigargin-induced current was nearly complete  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m  xxxd1762xxx . this inhibition of current induced by calcium agonists suggests that
 xxxd1762xxx  inhibits both cftr and cacc channels, with
apparently much stronger inhibition of the latter. further
measurements were done using transfected cell systems to
study  xxxd1762xxx  effects on cftr and caccs in isolation.
although  xxxd1762xxx  is membrane-impermeable because of
its size and polarity, and thus should access only the luminal
surface of intestinal epithelial cells, we investigated possible
effects of basolateral application of  xxxd1762xxx  on apical
membrane cftr and cacc. studies were done in t84 cells
in which 50 ␮m  xxxd1762xxx  was added to the basolateral
bathing solution for 10 min before measurement of shortcircuit current. it is interesting that, although  xxxd1762xxx  did
not affect the initial currents induced by the cftr and cacc
agonists  xxxd1742xxx  and atp, respectively,  xxxd1762xxx  slowly
reduced cl⫺ secretion over many minutes (fig. 2c). although
probably not relevant to its antidiarrheal mechanisms,  xxxd1762xxx  may act at the basolateral surface of t84 cells to
inhibit one or more transporters involved in transepithelial
cl⫺ secretion.
 xxxd1762xxx  is a partial antagonist of cftr clⴚ conductance. cftr cl⫺ current was measured in cftr-expressing frt cells, in which the basolateral membrane was
permeabilized by  xxxd164xxx , and a transepithelial cl⫺
gradient was applied. frt cells were used here because they
lack intrinsic chloride channel activity, form tight junctions,

grow quickly, and are readily transfected with chloride channel cdnas and reporter indicators (verkman and galietta,
2009). under these conditions, the measured current provides a direct quantitative measure of cftr cl⫺ conductance. figure 3a shows apical membrane current measurements in which cftr cl⫺ conductance was stimulated by
cpt-camp, which was followed by the addition of different
concentrations of  xxxd1762xxx  in the apical bathing solution.
increasing concentrations of  xxxd1762xxx  produced notably
more rapid, although partial, inhibition of cftr cl⫺ current.
the addition of  xxxd1762xxx  to the basolateral bathing solution
did not inhibit current (data not shown). as summarized in
fig. 3b (e) the apparent ic50 value (giving 50% inhibition of
cl⫺ current) for  xxxd1762xxx  was ⬃7 ␮m, and the maximal
inhibition was ⬃60%. similar results were obtained when
the apical and basolateral bathing solutions were switched
(high cl⫺ in apical solution) (fig. 3b, f), indicating that
 xxxd1762xxx  inhibition of cftr does not depend on cl⫺ concentration. in contrast to the partial inhibition by  xxxd1762xxx ,
maximal cftr inhibition by cftrinh-172 or glyh-101 is
approximately 100% (see below).
measurements were done to investigate whether the  xxxd1762xxx  inhibition potency depends on the cftr activation mechanism. figure 4a shows similar responses to 50, 200, and 500
␮m  xxxd1762xxx  using agonists that activate cftr directly (apigenin) or through camp-dependent cftr phosphorylation ( xxxd1742xxx ). the reversibility of  xxxd1762xxx  inhibition of cftr was
investigated, because washout during secretory diarrhea is a
concern with the use of a nonabsorbable antisecretory agent.
figure 4b shows apical current measurements, in which cftr
cl⫺ current was stimulated by cpt-camp and then inhibited
by different concentrations of  xxxd1762xxx . after extensive washing, residual cftr inhibition was determined from the current
after restimulation by cpt-camp. in control studies in the

activated by 100 ␮m cpt-camp followed by the addition of indicated concentrations of  xxxd1762xxx  to the luminal solution. b,  xxxd1762xxx  concentration

 xxxd1762xxx  inhibition of chloride channels

absence of  xxxd1762xxx , washout (of cpt-camp) followed by restimulation produced a current similar to that seen in the initial
stimulation. however, after inhibition with different concentrations of  xxxd1762xxx , washout studies showed partial (25–35%)
reversal of cftr inhibition over 30 min. extended time studies
showed ⬍50% reversal of  xxxd1762xxx  inhibition at 4 h (data not
shown).
to evaluate the possibility that the site of action of  xxxd1762xxx  on
cftr might overlap with that of the small-molecule thiazolidinone and glycine  xxxd2396xxx  cftr inhibitors, we compared cftr
inhibition in the absence and presence of preadded  xxxd1762xxx .

figure 4c (left) shows concentration-inhibition studies of cftr
inhibition by cftrinh-172 and glyh-101. maximal inhibition was
⬃100%, with ic50 values of ⬃1 and ⬃8 ␮m, respectively. figure
4c (right) shows similar concentration-inhibition measurements,
in which 50 ␮m  xxxd1762xxx  was added initially to inhibit cftr
cl⫺ current by ⬃50%. despite the partial antagonist mechanism
of  xxxd1762xxx , cftrinh-172 and glyh-101 were able to inhibit
cftr by nearly 100%. the similar ic50 values for cftrinh-172
and glyh-101 in the absence and presence of  xxxd1762xxx  suggests
nonoverlapping cftr inhibition sites for  xxxd1762xxx  and cftrinh172 or glyh-101.

tradtrantip et al.

patch-clamp was done to investigate the molecular mechanism of cftr inhibition by  xxxd1762xxx . whole-cell membrane current was measured in cftr-expressing frt cells
(fig. 5a, left). stimulation by 10 ␮m  xxxd1742xxx  produced a
membrane current of 179 ⫾ 18 pa/pf (n ⫽ 3) at ⫹100 mv
(total membrane capacitance, 15.8 ⫾ 4 pf).  xxxd1762xxx  at 50
␮m gave ⬃60% inhibition of cftr cl⫺ current. figure 5a
(right) shows an approximately linear current-voltage relationship for cftr, as expected for cftr. the cftr currentvoltage relationship remained linear after  xxxd1762xxx  addition, indicating a voltage-independent block mechanism, as
expected for an uncharged inhibitor.
to assess single-channel cftr properties, cell-attached
patch recordings were done on cftr-expressing frt cells in

the absence or presence of  xxxd1762xxx  in the pipette solution
(fig. 5b). the addition of 10 ␮m  xxxd1742xxx  and 100 ␮m  xxxd2388xxx 
to the bath resulted in cftr channel opening. cftr unitary
conductance was 7.2 ⫾ 0.1 ps (n ⫽ 4), which was not affected
by  xxxd1762xxx .  xxxd1762xxx  reduced channel activity remarkably, as seen by the less frequent channel openings (fig. 5b,
left). analysis of single-channel recordings indicated that
 xxxd1762xxx  significantly reduced open-channel probability
(po) from 0.71 ⫾ 0.04 (n ⫽ 4) to 0.40 ⫾ 0.04 (n ⫽ 3). mean
channel open time was not significantly changed, but mean
channel closed time was significantly increased (fig. 5b,
bottom), indicating that  xxxd1762xxx  stabilizes the channel
closed state. these results suggest that  xxxd1762xxx  inhibits
cftr by an altered channel-gating mechanism.

 xxxd1762xxx  inhibition of chloride channels

 xxxd1762xxx  is a strong inhibitor of the cacc
 xxxg162xxx . the data in fig. 2b suggest that  xxxd1762xxx 
strongly inhibits cacc(s) in t84 cells. recent work has implicated the protein  xxxg162xxx  as a cacc in multiple epithelial cells, including intestinal epithelia, as well as in
smooth muscle, nerve, and other cell types (caputo et al.,
2008; schroeder et al., 2008; yang et al., 2008). to test
whether  xxxg162xxx  is the cacc target of  xxxd1762xxx , frt
epithelial cells stably expressing  xxxg162xxx  were pretreated
with different concentrations of  xxxd1762xxx , followed by the
addition of 1 ␮m  xxxd2379xxx  to stimulate  xxxg162xxx  cl⫺
current. measurements were made in the presence of a transepithelial cl⫺ gradient, so that current is a direct, quantitative measure of  xxxg162xxx  cl⫺ conductance. figure 6a
shows  xxxd1762xxx  concentration-dependent inhibition of
 xxxg162xxx  cl⫺ current, which was nearly complete at high
concentrations of  xxxd1762xxx . figure 6b shows an ic50 for
 xxxd1762xxx  inhibition of  xxxg162xxx  of ⬃6.5 ␮m.
whole-cell membrane current was measured in tmem16aexpressing frt cells (fig. 6c). stimulation by 100 ␮m atp
produced a membrane current of 56 ⫾ 13 pa/pf (n ⫽ 3) at
⫹100 mv. pretreatment with 10 ␮m  xxxd1762xxx  inhibited
atp-induced  xxxg162xxx  cl⫺ current by 58% (24 ⫾ 6 pa/pf,

percentage inhibition of  xxxg162xxx  by  xxxd1762xxx  was voltage-independent (data not shown), as seen from the similar
shapes of the current-voltage relationships without versus
with  xxxd1762xxx , indicating a voltage-independent block
mechanism. these results define a second, distinct luminal
membrane cl⫺ channel target of  xxxd1762xxx .
 xxxd1762xxx  has little effect on apical cation channels and camp/calcium signaling. the apical membrane
of enterocytes also contains na⫹ and k⫹ channels, which are
potential additional targets of  xxxd1762xxx . to investigate
whether  xxxd1762xxx  alters the activity of the epithelial cell
na⫹ channel enac, short-circuit current was measured in
primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells, which
robustly express enac and in which the change in shortcircuit current after amiloride provides a quantitative measure of enac activity (yamaya et al., 1992). figure 7a shows
that pretreatment of the cell culture with 50 ␮m  xxxd1762xxx 
produced a small, ⬃20% inhibition of enac activity. human
bronchial epithelial cells also express  xxxg162xxx  and have
robust cacc activity.  xxxd1762xxx  pretreatment produced a
⬎90% reduction in short-circuit current after the addition of
calcium-elevating agonist utp, in agreement with the conclusions from t84 cells and  xxxg162xxx -transfected frt cells,
above.
possible inhibition of apical k⫹ channels by  xxxd1762xxx  was
tested in human bronchial epithelial cells, in which the basolateral membrane was permeabilized with  xxxd164xxx

in the presence of a transepithelial k⫹ gradient. under these
conditions, the small measured current is an apical membrane k⫹ current. apical k⫹ current was measured after the
addition of bacl2, a nonspecific inhibitor of k⫹ channels.
figure 7b shows that pretreatment with 50 ␮m  xxxd1762xxx 
produced a small, ⬃22% inhibition of apical membrane k⫹
current.
last, we tested the possibility that  xxxd1762xxx  action on
apical membrane receptor(s) might affect major intracellular
signaling pathways, which might secondarily modulate the
activities of basolateral membrane transporters to inhibit
transcellular cl⫺ secretion indirectly. figure 7c shows that
 xxxd1762xxx  at 50 ␮m had no significant effect on basal or
 xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp concentrations in t84 cells. figure 7d shows that  xxxd1762xxx  did not alter basal cytoplasmic
calcium concentration or affect the elevation in calcium concentration after atp treatment in t84 cells.

discussion
 xxxd1762xxx  is a  xxxd1979xxx  molecule isolated from the
latex of the plant species c. lechleri of the family euphorbiaceae.  xxxd1762xxx  is an amorphous, dark red-brown powder
consisting of an oligomeric proanthocyanidin of varying chain
lengths with an average molecular mass of 2100 da.  xxxd1762xxx  has been characterized by 1h nmr, 13c nmr, and mass
spectrometry, producing the putative structure shown in fig.
2a (ubillas et al., 1994). the polymer chains mostly range
from 3 to 30 monomer units linked together in a random
sequence through either c-43 c-6 and/or c-43 c-8. the monomeric components are (⫹)-catechin, (⫺)-epicatechin, (⫹)gallocatechin, and (⫺)-epigallocatechin. the relative and absolute configuration of the monomer units was established by
optical rotation, circular dichroism, and 13c nmr, and from
analysis of monomers after depolymerization. recently completed clinical studies in adults with acute infectious diarrhea, one with predominantly e. coli diarrhea and the other

with v. cholera, showed significant clinical benefit of  xxxd1762xxx  in the resolution of the diarrheas (sharma et al., 2008;
bardhan et al., 2009).
the cellular antisecretory targets of  xxxd1762xxx  were investigated, focusing on the principal luminal membrane determinants of intestinal fluid secretion, including ion channels
and signaling pathways. we found that  xxxd1762xxx  inhibited
apical membrane camp-stimulated (cftr) and calciumstimulated (cacc) cl⫺ channels, with little effect on cation
channels or camp/calcium signaling. it is noteworthy that
 xxxd1762xxx  inhibited two distinct cl⫺ channels, which are
unrelated in their sequences and putative structures. the
dual cellular actions of  xxxd1762xxx , together with its slow
washout, may account for its broad antisecretory activity in
diarrheas caused by bacterial enterotoxins, viruses, and
other effectors. inhibition of both cftr and caccs is of
particular interest because of camp/calcium cross-talk in
enterocytes and thus the potential involvement of both types
of cl⫺ channels in some diarrheas.  xxxd1762xxx  action at the
basolateral surface of t84 cells also reduced net cl⫺ secretion, perhaps by inhibition of one or more transporters involved in transcellular cl⫺ secretion such as the basolateral
na⫹/k⫹ pump, nkcc symporter, or k⫹ channel(s). because
 xxxd1762xxx  has minimal oral absorption, it is not expected to
access the basolateral surface of enterocytes in the intestine,
and its action on basolateral transporter(s) is probably not
important in its antidiarrheal mechanisms.
 xxxd1762xxx  acted as a partial antagonist of cftr cl⫺
conductance, with a concentration-dependent rate of inhibition over several minutes. washout of the  xxxd1762xxx  was
slow, occurring over hours. it is unknown why, unlike thiazolidinone and glycine  xxxd2396xxx  cftr inhibitors,  xxxd1762xxx  inhibition of cftr cl⫺ conductance is partial even at
very high concentrations. some possibilities for such partial
inhibition include partial external cftr pore blockade by
the large  xxxd1762xxx  molecule and an intrinsically inefficient

 xxxd1762xxx  inhibition of chloride channels

allosteric inhibition mechanism. patch-clamp analysis indicated that  xxxd1762xxx  action on the extracellular-facing
cftr surface produces voltage-independent channel inhibition with stabilization of the channel closed state and without rapid channel flicker. therefore,  xxxd1762xxx  inhibition of
cftr is unlikely to involve direct pore occlusion. in contrast,
cftr inhibitors of the glycine  xxxd2396xxx  class produced a
voltage-dependent block, with inward rectification of residual cftr cl⫺ current, and direct pore occlusion with rapid
flicker in membrane current (muanprasat et al., 2004; sonawane et al., 2006, 2007, 2008). the independence of  xxxd1762xxx  and glyh-101 action seen in fig. 4c is consistent
with  xxxd1762xxx  action at a site different from that of glyh101, which occludes the cftr pore. the larger molecular
size of  xxxd1762xxx  compared with glyh-101 is consistent with
 xxxd1762xxx  action at a site outside of the cftr pore. prior
studies (gabriel et al., 1999) suggested evidence for cftr
inhibition by  xxxd1762xxx  in t84 cells in the presence of a large
cl⫺ gradient. however, in the previous studies, inhibition of
caccs was not recognized, and measurements were not done
in a defined system in which cftr could be studied in
isolation from caccs and other ion channels.
we discovered that  xxxd1762xxx  strongly inhibited cacc(s).
there is evidence, albeit indirect, suggesting that caccs in
intestinal epithelial cells provide an important route for cl⫺
and fluid secretion in secretory diarrheas caused by certain
drugs, including some antiretrovirals and chemotherapeutics, and some viruses (morris et al., 1999; barrett and keely,
2000; kidd and thorn, 2000; takahashi et al., 2000; gyömörey et al., 2001; rufo et al., 2004; schultheiss et al., 2005,
2006; thiagarajah and verkman, 2005; lorrot and vasseur,
2007). in addition to their expression in intestinal epithelial
cells, caccs are broadly expressed in many cell types, in
which they are involved in different functions, including
transepithelial fluid secretion, olfactory and sensory signal
transduction, smooth muscle contraction, and cardiac excitation (hartzell et al., 2005; verkman and galietta, 2009). the
molecular identity of caccs was unclear until recently,
when three independent laboratories reported  xxxg162xxx 
( xxxg162xxx ) as a cacc (caputo et al., 2008; schroeder et
al., 2008; yang et al., 2008). several lines of evidence supported the conclusion that  xxxg162xxx  is a cacc, including
the demonstration that cacc cl⫺ currents in tmem16atransfected cells are similar in electrophysiological characteristics with native caccs and reduction in cacc cl⫺ current after rnai knockdown of  xxxg162xxx .  xxxg162xxx  is
expressed broadly in epithelial and other cell types in multiple organs, including intestinal epithelium. it is not known at
this time whether intestinal epithelial cells express other
caccs as well. we found here that  xxxd1762xxx  strongly inhibited human  xxxg162xxx , which probably accounts, at least
in part, for its inhibition of cl⫺ current in t84 cells after
addition of calcium-elevating agonists. the precise role of
 xxxg162xxx  in various secretory diarrheas remains to be elucidated.
in conclusion, the cellular antisecretory action of  xxxd1762xxx  seems to involve two distinct cl⫺ channel targets on
the luminal membrane of epithelial cells lining the intestine. we did not investigate the possibility that  xxxd1762xxx 
metabolites formed in the intestine might have additional
cellular effects on enterocytes. the dual inhibition of cftr
and cacc cl⫺ channels by  xxxd1762xxx  provides insights

77

into the understanding of its therapeutic effects in the
treatment of secretory diarrheal disorders of various etiologies (holodniy et al., 1999; dicesare et al., 2002; mangel and chaturvedi, 2008), which share the common feature of excessive cl⫺ secretion.
