prostacyclin analogues inhibit  xxxg748xxx 
expression in the human monocytic cell line
thp-1 via a  xxxd1773xxx -dependent mechanism
david j. crutchley, denis e. solomon, and lobelia b. conanan
increased expression of  xxxg748xxx  procoagulant by peripheral blood monocytes has been implicated in
a number of thrombotic disorders. the present studies were undertaken to determine whether stable
analogues of prostacyclin, a potent endothelium-derived platelet inhibitor and vasodilator, could inhibit
 xxxg748xxx  expression by human monocytic cells. exposure of monocytic tumor thp-1 cells to 100 ng/ml
endotoxin, 2 units/ml  xxxg1161xxx , or 5 ng/ml  xxxg2296xxx -** for 4 hours led to increased
 xxxg748xxx  procoagulant activity. preincubation for 30 minutes with  xxxd2331xxx , ciprostene, and carbacyclin
led to a dose-dependent inhibition of  xxxg748xxx  expression induced by all three challenging agents.
 xxxd2331xxx  was the most potent: 50% inhibition occurred at 5 nm, a concentration close to the reported
dissociation constant for  xxxd2331xxx  binding to the platelet  xxxg1879xxx . an orally active analogue,
cicaprost, was equally effective against endotoxin-induced  xxxg748xxx  expression. carbacyclin and
ciprostene were 100 times less potent.  xxxd2331xxx  prevented the endotoxin-induced expression of  xxxg748xxx 
antigen on the surface of thp-1 cells, as determined by flow cytometry.  xxxd2331xxx  (500 pm-50 nm)
increased intracellular levels of  xxxd1773xxx . this effect was potentiated by  xxxd2388xxx , an
inhibitor of phosphodiesterase. the inhibitory effects of  xxxd2331xxx  on  xxxg748xxx  expression were also
potentiated by  xxxd2388xxx  and mimicked by  xxxd1742xxx  and dibutyryl  xxxd1773xxx  but not
dibutyryl  xxxd1274xxx . these results suggest that prostacyclin may play a role in downregulating tissue
factor expression in monocytes, at least in part via elevation of intracellular levels of  xxxd1773xxx .

xposure of peripheral blood monocytes to a
variety of agents leads to the expression of
 xxxg748xxx , a membrane-bound glycoprotein
that plays a critical role in blood coagulation as the
cellular receptor and cofactor for factor vila. 12 the
agents include bacterial endotoxin3; antigen-antibody
complexes4; activated complement fragments56; and cytokines, such as the t-cell-derived monocyte procoagulant-inducing factor,7 interleukin-1 (il-1),8-10 and  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf),8-911 although the efficacy of
the latter two has been questioned.7 monocyte tissue
factor expression is thought to be a result of gene
transcription and mrna stabilization.1213 at present,
the physiological factors that downregulate these processes are not well identified.
we have previously shown that  xxxd2331xxx , a stable
analogue of prostacyclin,14 is a potent inhibitor of
endotoxin-induced  xxxg748xxx  expression in human
peripheral blood monocytes and a monocytic tumor cell
line, thp-1. 15 these preliminary studies suggest a novel
role for prostacyclin in addition to its well-established
role as a vasodilator and a platelet inhibitor (for review,

see reference 16). the present studies were undertaken to determine whether the effects of  xxxd2331xxx  are 1)
shared by other prostacyclin analogues and 2) expressed
against  xxxg748xxx  induction by agents other than
endotoxin. in addition, because both  xxxd2331xxx  and prostacyclin stimulate adenylate cyclase,17"20 we have explored the role of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate
(camp) in mediating the inhibitory effects of  xxxd2331xxx 
on monocytic cell  xxxg748xxx  expression.

cell culture and incubations
the cells were grown in rpmi-1640 medium containing 100 fig/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 10%
fetal bovine serum, and 10 mm af-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-jv-2'-ethanesulfonic acid (hepes), ph 7.4. serum was heated at 56°c for 30 minutes to inactivate
complement. for the experiments, cells were seeded
into 24-well dishes at a density of 5 x 105 cells/ml and
incubated for 30 minutes at 37°c with growth medium
containing varying concentrations of prostacyclin analogues or other inhibitors.  xxxd2331xxx  and cicaprost were
supplied in sterile saline solution. carbacyclin, ciprostene, and  xxxd1742xxx  were dissolved in ethanol and added
to the medium so that the concentration of ethanol was
0.1% (vol/vol). ethanol at this concentration had no
effect on cell  xxxg748xxx  expression. cyclic nucleotides
and  xxxd2388xxx  were dissolved directly in the medium. after
a 30-minute incubation, endotoxin, il-1/3, or  xxxg2296xxx  in
sterile saline was added, and the cells were incubated
further for 4 hours. cells treated with all of the aforementioned combinations remained more than 95% viable, as determined by exclusion of trypan blue. after
incubation the cells were collected by centrifugation,
washed with puck's saline a solution or serum-free
rpmi-1640 medium, and resuspended in tris-saline
buffer (50 mm tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane [tris]
and 110 mm nacl, ph 7.4).
procoagulant activity assays
procoagulant activity on the surface of thp-1 cells
was determined by a single-stage clotting assay. fifty
microliters of cell suspension containing 0.3-1.8xlo 6
cells was mixed with 50 /il 25 mm cacl2. clotting was
initiated by the addition of 50 fil normal human plasma,
and the time for clotting to occur at 37°c was recorded
by using a fibrometer (bbl, cockeysville, md.). procoagulant activity was quantified by reference to a rabbit
brain thromboplastin standard; vials were reconstituted
in 5 ml buffer and assigned a value of 100,000 units/ml;
a 10-fold dilution of this preparation clotted plasma in
approximately 28 seconds. a standard curve was constructed by plotting log (units) versus log (clotting time)
values. the procoagulant activity of standard thromboplastin and cell suspensions was not affected by prostacyclin analogues or other inhibitors when added at the
assay stage.
procoagulant activity was functionally characterized
as  xxxg748xxx  by establishing that the cells failed to
shorten the clotting time of plasma deficient in factor
vii. immunological characterization was achieved by
demonstrating that htf1-7b8, a blocking monoclonal
antibody to human tissue factor22 (generously provided
by dr. steven carson, university of nebraska medical
center), specifically inhibited the ability of the cell
suspensions to shorten the clotting times of normal
plasma (50% inhibition, 500 ng/ml).

camp assays
thp-1 cells were incubated for 30 minutes with
growth medium containing 500 pm-50 nm  xxxd2331xxx , 200
jim  xxxd2388xxx , 100 fim  xxxd1742xxx , or combinations thereof.
after incubation, the cells were rapidly centrifuged by
using a microfuge, washed with cold phosphate-buffered
saline, and resuspended in ethanol containing 0.01n
hc1. the cells were disrupted by brief sonication, and
sonicates were incubated at room temperature for 5
minutes. coagulated protein was removed by centrifugation and washed once with ethanol/water (2:1, vol/
vol). supernatants were combined and evaporated to
dryness at 55°c under nitrogen, and residues were
dissolved in assay buffer (50 mm tris and 4 mm edta,
ph 7.5). camp was measured by a commercial kit
(amersham corp., arlington heights, 111.) according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
flow cytometry
fluorescent flow cytometry was carried out essentially according to the method of carson et al.23 briefly,
thp-1 cells were incubated with or without 100 nm
 xxxd2331xxx  for 30 minutes and then incubated for 4 hours
longer with 100 ng/ml endotoxin. after washing, a
sample of the cell suspension was tested for surface
procoagulant activity. the remaining cells were incubated with normal human serum for 15 minutes to block
the fc binding sites. the serum contained 10 mm
edta to block  xxxg750xxx  binding. cells were then
washed twice with tris-saline buffer and incubated with
20 jig/ml of a fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc)-conjugated monoclonal antibody to human  xxxg748xxx 
(4508cj, generously provided by dr. richard hart,
american diagnostica) or fitc-conjugated nonimmune immunoglobulin g (igg). incubations were carried out at 4°c for 30 minutes. the cells were then
washed twice, and the fluorescence intensity of
5-10xlo 3 cells was measured at 488 nm in a facscan
flow cytometer (becton dickinson, rutherford, n.j.)
equipped with an air-cooled argon ion laser. the instrument was gated to the appropriate cell size by comparing forward-angle versus 90° light scatter.
data analysis
statistical analysis of data was performed by student's t test. differences were considered significant at
the 95% confidence level or higher.  xxxd1289xxx  (the concentration causing 50% inhibition) values were calculated
from a plot of percent inhibition versus log of inhibitor
concentration. percent inhibition was calculated as

results
exposure of thp-1 cells for 4 hours to 5 ng/ml
 xxxg2296xxx  produced significant (p<0.005) twofold increases in surface  xxxg748xxx  activity. similarly, exposure to 2 units/ml il-1/3 produced three- to fivefold
increases. preliminary experiments established that
these were submaximal concentrations for both agents.
as shown in figure 1, preincubation of the cells for 30
minutes with 100 pm  xxxd2331xxx  slightly enhanced il-1/3and  xxxg2296xxx -induced activity, although only the latter

thp-1 monocytic cells were preincubated for 30 minutes with

significantly different from those obtained from cells treated
with cytokines alone, as follows: *p<0.05, **p<0.005.

enhancement was statistically significant. higher concentrations of  xxxd2331xxx  strongly inhibited cytokine-induced  xxxg748xxx  expression; at 100 nm the stimulatory effects of both cytokines were essentially abolished.
an  xxxd1289xxx  of approximately 5 nm was obtained against each
agent, identical to that observed with endotoxin-induced  xxxg748xxx  expression.15
the ability of three other prostacyclin analogues to
inhibit monocytic cell  xxxg748xxx  induction was investigated. as shown in figure 2, an orally active analogue,
cicaprost,24 was equipotent with  xxxd2331xxx  in inhibiting
endotoxin-induced  xxxg748xxx  expression. carbacyclin
and ciprostene were approximately two orders of magnitude less potent. thus, ciprostene at concentrations of
100 nm or higher inhibited  xxxg748xxx  activity in
response to both endotoxin and il-1/3 (figure 3).
ciprostene also inhibited  xxxg2296xxx -induced  xxxg748xxx 
expression over the same concentration range (not
shown). in a similar manner, carbacyclin inhibited
monocytic cell  xxxg748xxx  induced by  xxxg2296xxx  (figure
3), endotoxin, and il-l/j (not shown).  xxxd1289xxx  concentrations
for each inhibitor were approximately 500 nm, irrespective of the challenging agent employed.
to explore the mechanism of action of  xxxd2331xxx , flow
cytometry techniques were employed to measure the
cellular binding of an fitc-labeled monoclonal antibody directed against human  xxxg748xxx . a total of
four experiments were carried out with similar results.
a typical experiment is shown in figure 4. cells incubated for 4 hours in the absence of endotoxin showed
antibody-associated fluorescence comparable to that of
a nonimmune igg control (figure 4a). in contrast,
antibody-associated fluorescence was threefold higher
in cells exposed to 100 ng/ml endotoxin for 4 hours,
whereas nonspecific fluorescence remained unchanged,

vehicle (m). cells were then incubated for 4 hours with up to
1 fig/ml endotoxin, and procoagulant activity (pca) on the
cell surface was determined. values are mean±sem of four

indicating increased expression of  xxxg748xxx  antigen
on the cell surface (figure 4b). pretreatment of the
cells for 30 minutes with 100 nm  xxxd2331xxx  abolished the
endotoxin effect (figure 4c). specific cellular fluorescence intensity agreed reasonably well with the procoagulant activities of these cells, which were as follows:
control, 56 units/106 cells; endotoxin treated, 336 units/
106 cells; and  xxxd2331xxx  followed by endotoxin, 61 units/
106 cells. thus, procoagulant activity increased sixfold
and fluorescence intensity increased threefold after
endotoxin exposure, whereas  xxxd2331xxx  essentially abolished both responses. lesser changes in monoclonal
antibody binding relative to those in procoagulant activity have also been noted by carson et al.23
the role of camp in the inhibition of  xxxg748xxx 
expression by  xxxd2331xxx  was then explored. measurements of camp in thp-1 cells were made after a
30-minute incubation, the time point at which the
challenging agents would routinely be added. basal
levels of camp were low (0.9+0.2 pmol/106 cells) and
increased modestly to 2.8±0.8 pmol/106 cells after exposure to 500 pm  xxxd2331xxx  (figure 5). at this concentration  xxxd2331xxx  had no observable effect on procoagulant activity. higher concentrations induced dramatic
increases in camp; 5 nm  xxxd2331xxx  induced a 27-fold
increase, and 50 nm induced a 95-fold increase, to
23.3±7.0 and 83.3±14.9 pmol/106 cells, respectively.
 xxxd2331xxx  therefore increased camp levels in thp-1 cells
over the same concentration range at which it inhibited
 xxxg748xxx  expression.
as expected, the stimulation of camp by  xxxd2331xxx  was
significantly enhanced in the presence of 200 /xm
 xxxd2388xxx , an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase. thus, 500
pm, 5 nm, and 50 nm  xxxd2331xxx  induced ninefold, 69fold, and 234-fold increases in camp, respectively,
relative to untreated cells (figure 5). importantly,

pm (not shown) and completely inhibited  xxxg748xxx

(figure 6). indeed,  xxxd2331xxx  combined with  xxxd2388xxx  was
more potent than would be predicted from its effects on
camp levels. thus, 500 pm  xxxd2331xxx  plus  xxxd2388xxx  raised
camp levels to 8.0±2.5 pmol/106 cells and abolished
 xxxg748xxx  expression, whereas 5 nm  xxxd2331xxx  alone
increased camp levels to 23.3±7.0 pmol/106 cells and

further experiments showed that the effects of  xxxd2331xxx  could be mimicked by agents that elevate intracellular camp by receptor-independent mechanisms.
these included  xxxd1742xxx , which is thought to directly
activate the catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase,25 and
dibutyryl camp, a membrane-penetrable analogue of
camp. as shown in figure 7, both endotoxin- and
tnf-o-induced  xxxg748xxx  expression in thp-1 cells

discussion
our previous studies have shown that  xxxd2331xxx  potently inhibits endotoxin-induced expression of tissue
factor procoagulant activity by human peripheral blood
monocytes and thp-1 monocytic cells.15  xxxd2331xxx  also
blunted further increases in procoagulant activity in
cells already exposed to endotoxin, although higher
concentrations were required under these conditions.
 xxxd2331xxx  was approximately one order of magnitude
more potent than prostaglandin ej, which has also been
shown to inhibit monocyte  xxxg748xxx  expression.26
we have now extended these observations to show
that  xxxd2331xxx  inhibits  xxxg748xxx  induction by two
cytokines,  xxxg2296xxx  and il-1/3, with the same potency
observed with induction by endotoxin. furthermore, the
inhibitory properties were shared by three other prostacyclin analogues, cicaprost, ciprostene, and carbacyclin. thus, inhibition of  xxxg748xxx  expression by
monocytic cells in response to various stimuli appears to
be a general property of this class of drugs.
the  xxxd1289xxx  values of 5 and 500 nm obtained for  xxxd2331xxx 
and carbacyclin, respectively, are very close to the
reported dissociation constants (8 nm and 528 nm,
respectively) for the binding of these agents to the
 xxxg1879xxx  on platelet membranes.27 these
observations suggest that prostacyclin itself is likely to

ancy may have been due to the difference in the times at
which measurements of camp and procoagulant activity were made. nevertheless, the results raise the possibility that  xxxd2331xxx  may exert its effects via additional
mechanisms.

be the endogenous ligand and may, therefore, be a
physiological regulator of monocyte  xxxg748xxx  expression. in view of the suggested relation between tissue
factor and the receptors for several growth factors and
cytokines,2 it is reasonable to ask whether prostacyclin
may have other effects on monocyte function and
whether the monocyte, like the platelet, may be a
primary target of this agent.
the present studies also provide additional insight
into the mechanism of action of  xxxd2331xxx . three lines of
evidence suggest that  xxxd2331xxx , like prostacyclin,16 exerts
its effects at least in part via stimulation of adenylate
cyclase. first,  xxxd2331xxx  increased camp levels in thp-1
cells over the same concentration range at which it
inhibited  xxxg748xxx  expression. second, the effects of
 xxxd2331xxx  on both camp and  xxxg748xxx  were potentiated by an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase. third, both
endotoxin- and  xxxg2296xxx -induced  xxxg748xxx  expression
were effectively inhibited by other agents known to
elevate camp. the latter observation confirms earlier
reports of variable inhibition by such agents on tissue
factor activity in human peripheral blood monocytes.28-29 the ability of  xxxd2331xxx  to block the expression
of  xxxg748xxx  antigen on the surface of thp-1 cells
(figure 4) would be consistent with a role of the
inhibition of  xxxg748xxx  synthesis, perhaps by interference with the process of gene transcription and/or
stabilization of  xxxg748xxx  mrna. 1213 further studies
are required to clarify this point.
increased  xxxg748xxx  expression by monocytes may
contribute to the disseminated intravascular coagulation associated with disorders such as allograft rejection, bacterial infection, carcinoma, and immune disease (for reviews, see references 1 and 30). more
recently, it has been suggested that increased monocyte
 xxxg748xxx  activity may also contribute to the postoperative thrombotic state.31"35 other investigators have
shown that the development of fulminant hepatitis is
accompanied by increased monocyte procoagulant activity in a virally infected mouse model36-37; furthermore, both the hepatitis and the monocyte procoagulant
activity are inhibited by the administration of  xxxd1903xxx  and its 16,16-dimethyl analogue.38-39 the
potency of  xxxd2331xxx  and its effectiveness against multiple
challenging agents suggest that it may also be valuable
in the treatment of monocyte-driven coagulopathies,
particularly if used in conjunction with a clinically
effective phosphodiesterase inhibitor.
