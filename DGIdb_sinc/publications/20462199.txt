abstract:

catalysis by a class i ribonucleotide reductase (rnr) begins when a cysteine (c) residue in the
r2 subunit is oxidized to a thiyl radical (c•) by a cofactor ∼35 å away in the  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  subunit. in a class ia or ib
rnr, a stable tyrosyl radical (y•) is the c oxidant, whereas a mniv/feiii cluster serves this function in the
class ic enzyme from chlamydia trachomatis (ct). it is thought that, in either case, a chain of y residues
spanning the two subunits mediates c oxidation by forming transient “pathway” y•s in a multistep electron
transfer (et) process that is “gated” by the protein so that it occurs only in the ready holoenzyme complex.
the drug hydroxyurea (hu) inactivates both ia/b and ic  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  subunits by reducing their c oxidants. reduction
of the stable cofactor y• (y122•) in escherichia coli class ia  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  is faster in the presence of r2 and a substrate
(cdp), leading to speculation that hu might intercept a transient et pathway y• under these turnover
conditions. here we show that this mechanism is one of two that are operant in hu inactivation of the ct
enzyme. hu reacts with the mniv/feiii cofactor to give two distinct products: the previously described
homogeneous mniii/feiii- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  complex, which forms only under turnover conditions (in the presence of r2 and
the substrate), and a distinct, diamagnetic mn/fe cluster, which forms ∼900-fold less rapidly as a second
phase in the reaction under turnover conditions and as the sole outcome in the reaction of mniv/feiii- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  only.
formation of mniii/feiii- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  also requires (i) either y338, the subunit-interfacial et pathway residue of  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx , or
y222, the surface residue that relays the “extra electron” to the mniv/feiv intermediate during activation of
 xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  but is not part of the catalytic et pathway, and (ii) w51, the cofactor-proximal residue required for
efficient et between either y222 or y338 and the cofactor. the combined requirements for the catalytic
subunit, the substrate, and, most importantly, a functional surface-to-cofactor electron relay system imply
that hu effects the mniv/feiii f mniii/feiii reduction by intercepting a y• that forms when the ready
holoenzyme complex is assembled, the et gate is opened, and the mniv oxidizes either y222 or y338.
ribonucleotide reductases (rnrs)1 catalyze the committed
step in the only known pathway for de novo biosynthesis of the
deoxyribonucleotide precursors to dna (1, 2). this reaction
proceeds by a free radical mechanism and is initiated by
abstraction of the 30 h atom of the substrate by a cysteine thiyl
radical (c•) (3, 4). the c• is not present in the resting enzyme but
is generated in situ by one-electron oxidation of a conserved
cysteine residue by an oxidized cofactor. on the basis of the
nature of the cofactor employed for generation of the c30 -habstracting c•, rnrs have been divided into classes i-iii (1, 2).

a class i rnr [e.g., those from all mammals, herpes simplex
virus i, and the most extensively studied enzyme from escherichia
coli (ec)] is composed of two homodimeric subunits (1, 5). the
catalytic subunit, r2, contains the substrate-binding site, the
cysteine residue that is transiently oxidized to the c•, and
additional c residues that deliver electrons and a proton to the
20 position of the substrate to reduce it (5). the  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  subunit harbors
the c-oxidizing cofactor. in a class ia or ib enzyme, the c oxidant
is a stable tyrosyl radical (y•) in the proximity of a carboxylatebridged dimetal cluster [fe2iii/iii in class ia (6-8) and either
fe2iii/iii (9, 10) or mn2iii/iii (11-13) in class ib]. the reaction
begins with the one-electron oxidation of the c (c439 in the
ec enzyme) in r2 by the y• (y122• in the ec enzyme) in  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  (5).
after substrate reduction, the c• reoxidizes the transiently reduced
y back to its radical form. this intersubunit radical transfer step
has several notable characteristics. first, the y• in  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  is (in the
protoyptical ec enzyme) thought to be ∼35 å from the radical c
in r2 (5, 14, 15), a distance too large for c oxidation to proceed at
the required rate by a single electron tunneling step. evidence
indicates that the et instead proceeds by a multistep tunneling
(“radical hopping” or “electron relay”) mechanism, in which
transient “pathway” radicals form along a chain of conserved,
aromatic amino acids (in the ec enzyme, w48 and y356 in  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  and
y730 and y731 in r2) to transfer the electron from the c to the y•

and back again (16-23). second, the individual et steps leading
to the net ∼35 å radical transfer are thought to be coupled to
proton transfers (proton-coupled et or pcet) (5, 24). third, in
the ec class ia rnr, the pcet step is gated by the protein so that
it occurs only in the ready holoenzyme complex, and binding of
the substrate to r2 is the key for opening of the gate (20, 22, 23, 25).
this conformational gating provides the mechanism by which the
potently oxidizing y122• can be stable for hours, even in the
presence of reductants that are sufficiently potent to reduce it
(e.g., ascorbate and thiols), but then accept the electron from c439
in tens to hundreds of milliseconds (25) upon assembly of the ready
holoenzyme complex and opening of the gate. the gating mechanism for the intersubunit pcet remains to be defined but is likely
to involve dynamic control of one or more of the coupled proton
transfer steps in response to protein conformation. in the simplest
case, substrate binding to r2 in the r2 3  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  complex (with the proper
effector also bound) could induce a conformational change
favoring a crucial proton transfer [perhaps to the buried cofactor
y• (5, 24) (figure 1a)], allowing the oxidizing equivalent to
propagate outward onto pathway residues and ultimately onto
the c residue in the r2 active site. however, it should be noted that
some class i rnrs have been shown to engage in more complex
subunit oligomerization equilibria, involving not only free r2,
free  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx , and r2beta2 but also higher-order complexes r4beta4 and
r6beta6 (26-33). because the oligomerization state drastically affects
activity and binding of nucleotides affects the oligomerization
state (26-33), it is possible that these changes could, in some cases,
be involved in the gating transition.
the y• in a class ia/b rnr can be reduced by a number of oneelectron reductants (6, 34). because this reaction inactivates
rnr to inhibit dna synthesis, it is medically important. one
such y• reductant, hydroxyurea (hu), is used as an anticancer
and antiviral agent (35). its reaction with ec  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  has been studied
by several groups (36-39). hu reduces the y122• of ec rnr

∼10 times more rapidly in the presence of r2, substrate, and
allosteric effector (turnover conditions) than in the absence of
these components (36). this observation was interpreted as
evidence that y122• reduction by hu proceeds by two distinct
mechanisms: direct access by the drug to the buried y122• in
“resting”  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  (39) and interception of a pathway radical intermediate of the multistep pcet process under turnover conditions (36, 38). one would expect the first mechanism not to
require a functional pcet pathway. this expectation was
verified for the class ia rnr from mus musculus (40). by
contrast, the more interesting second mechanism would be
expected to occur only with the pcet pathway at least partially
intact, i.e., not in variant  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  subunits with the oxidizing equivalent
effectively confined to the cofactor y• by mutagenesis of one of
the cofactor proximal pathway residues. surprisingly, this simple
and direct test was not subsequently reported for the ec enzyme
or for any other class i rnr. thus, the notion that hu can
intercept a pathway radical intermediate of the multistep pcet
has remained merely interesting speculation.
the class ic rnr from the obligate intracellular human
pathogen, chlamydia trachomatis (ct), employs a high-valent,
heterodinuclear mniv/feiii cofactor to initiate catalysis (41-44).
in a structural sense, the mniv ion replaces one fe ion from the
diiron cluster of a class ia rnr, and in a functional sense, it
replaces the y•. the mniv/feiii cofactor forms via a mniv/feiv
intermediate upon reaction of the mnii/feii form of ct  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  with
o2 (45). the electron needed to convert the feiv site of the
intermediate to the feiii ion of the stable cofactor is transferred to
the cluster site by w51 (the functional counterpart of w48 in
ec  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx ) and y222, a residue that has no role in the catalytic pcet
process and no functional counterpart in the class ia/b proteins (figure 1) (46). analogy to the well-studied ec enzyme and
results of mutagenesis experiments (46) imply that, during
catalysis, forward pcet from c672 converts the mniv/feiii
cluster to the mniii/feiii form, which has an s = 1/2 ground state
and is therefore epr-active. the epr spectrum of mniii/feiii- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx 
produced by dithionite (dt) reduction of the mniv/feiii state in
the absence of r2, substrate, and the allosteric effector is broad
and poorly resolved, suggesting heterogeneity in the structure
of the cluster (41). by contrast, reduction by dt in the presence
of his6 -delta(1-248)r2 [a catalytically active, affinity-tagged,
n-terminally truncated form of r2 that is more stable than the
wild-type subunit (47) and has been used in our previous mechanistic studies of ct rnr (41, 46) and throughout this work],
substrate, and the allosteric effector (turnover conditions) results
in a narrower, well-resolved epr spectrum indicative of a structurally homogeneous state (41). the same well-resolved epr
signal is also observed when the ct rnr holoenzyme acts on the
mechanism-based inactivator, 20 -azido-20 -deoxy-adp (41), and
when it is reduced by hu (48). it seems likely that the structural
perturbations to the cofactor revealed by the changes in the epr
spectrum of the mniii/feiii redox state reflect the pcet gating
transition.
in this work, we have defined the requirements for generation
of the homogeneous mniii/feiii state with the resolved epr
spectrum and have probed the mechanism of its production by
hu. the data provide direct evidence of two distinct mechanisms
for reaction of the mniv/feiii cofactor with hu [as previously
suggested for the ec enzyme (36, 38, 39)], with one involving
interception of a pathway y• generated by excursion of the hole
from the mniv site upon opening of the pcet gate, and the other
involving direct reaction with the mniv/feiii cluster. they

results and discussion
effects of the presence of r2, the substrate, and the
allosteric effector on the epr spectrum of the mniii/feiii
cluster. to define requirements for the development of the wellresolved epr signal of the mniii/feiii cluster in  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx , components
of the presumptive mniv/feiii- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  3 r2 3 substrate 3 effector complex
were systematically omitted. these samples were treated with
either dt or hu (or no reductant in the control samples) and
characterized by epr spectroscopy (figure 2). as expected, in the
absence of reductant, neither mniv/feiii- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  alone nor the protein
in the presence of his6-delta(1-248)r2, cdp, and atp exhibits an

components (spectrum a3), the presence of his6-delta(1-248)r2 only
(spectrum a4), or the presence of his6-delta(1-248)r2 and atp
(spectrum a5) exhibit nearly identical, broad, heterogeneous epr
spectra. these observations suggest that binding of the substrate,
cdp, triggers the transition that permits generation of the
resolved, homogeneous epr signal (spectrum a7). dt reduction
in the presence of all components but the allosteric effector, atp,
gives a signal (spectrum a6) that is the superposition of the broad
and well-resolved spectra, suggesting that atp may potentiate the
effect of the substrate.
by contrast to its reduction by dt, treatment of mniv/feiii- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx ,
either alone or in the presence of only his6-delta(1-248)r2, with hu
does not generate an epr-active species (spectra b3 and b4,
respectively). in the presence of both his6-delta(1-248)r2 and atp,
hu generates only a weak (∼10% of the maximum intensity)
resolved signal (spectrum b5), implying that the allosteric effector
does not by itself efficiently promote the structural transition
permitting generation of the resolved signal.2,3 again, the presence of the substrate, cdp, is the key for the development of
the resolved signal (spectrum b7). indeed, the signal reaches its
maximal intensity in the absence of the effector, atp (spectrum
b6), as long as cdp is present. thus, the results with both dt
and hu imply that binding of the substrate triggers the structural
change reported by the epr spectrum of the reduced state.

absence and presence of his6-delta(1-248)r2, cdp, and

in the absence and presence of his6-delta(1-248)r2, cdp, and atp
were defined in stopped-flow absorption (sf-abs) and freezequench epr (fq-epr) experiments. both the mniv/feiii cluster
and the reduction products have broad absorption bands between 300 and 500 nm without prominent peaks, but the features of the products are less intense, resulting in a decrease in
absorbance in the 300-500 nm region during the reaction (49).
deltaa390 versus time traces from the reaction of mniv/feiii- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  with
hu at 22 ( 2 °c in the presence of his6-delta(1-248)r2, cdp, and
atp exhibit two well-resolved phases (figure 3a). the fact that
the fast phase is absent in the reaction of only mniv/feiii- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  with
hu (figure 3b) suggests that this phase is associated with
formation of the s = 1/2 mniii/feiii cluster. this inference is
confirmed by the results of freeze-quench epr experiments at a
single hu concentration (20 mm). development of the wellresolved epr signal (figure s1 of the supporting information
and solid squares in figure 3a) is clearly coincident with the fast
phase in the sf-abs trace from the experiment at the same hu
concentration (black circles in figure 3a). the solid line through
the experimental epr intensities (squares) corresponds to a firstorder rate constant of 0.10 ( 0.03 s-1, in excellent agreement
with the apparent first-order rate constant of 0.09 ( 0.02 s-1
obtained by fitting (as described below) the sf-abs trace from

it is likely that the weak signal generated in the presence of atp but
in the absence of cdp reflects the effect of an adp contaminant in the
atp solution. (adp is a substrate for the enzyme.) analysis of the atp
solution by mass spectrometry confirmed that ∼16% of atp had been
hydrolyzed
to adp.

in the study by roshick et al. (47), truncation of residues 1-248 of
r2, which removes a region that is marked by its sequence as a  xxxd1148xxx 
binding site, did not appear to affect the behavior of the subunit toward
the activator, atp. however, because a potential nucleotide binding site
that is present in the wild-type subunit is absent in our his6-delta(1-248)r2,
caution is warranted in extending to the wild-type r2 subunit the
conclusion that atp binding plays a relatively minor role in his6delta(1-248)r2 in promoting the structural transition that permits formation of the mniii/feiii cluster with the well-resolved epr spectrum.

of his6-delta(1-248)r2 (which is expected to saturate  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  at these

asymmetry and a resultant “half-of-sites” reactivity in the ct

homogeneous mniii/feiii- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  state formed under turnover conditions. this spectral component accounts for ∼45% of the total
intensity. comparably broad and poorly resolved features were
previously observed for the heterogeneous mniii/feiii- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  state
produced by dithionite reduction of mniv/feiii- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  alone (49),
and this spectrum is shown as a solid black line for the sake of
comparison. because approximately half of the intensity of the
m€ossbauer spectrum can be attributed to the mniii/feiii complex, the product of the fast phase, these results provide additional evidence for half-of-sites reactivity of the presumptive
 xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  3 his6-delta(1-248)r2 3 cdp 3 atp complex. the remaining fraction of the 1 min spectrum can be attributed to the features of the
mniv/feiii- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  complex (42). comparison of the spectra of the
1 and 10 min samples reveals that prolonged incubation with hu
yields a small amount (∼10%) of a new quadrupole doublet,
indicated by red arrows. this quadrupole doublet also develops
when mniv/feiii- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  is reacted with hu in the absence of his6delta(1-248)r2, cdp, and atp. in the 4.2 k, zero-field m€ossbauer
spectrum of this  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -only sample (figure 4b), the contribution
from the mniv/feiii cluster (blue line) is diminished by 36%
relative to that in the starting mniv/feiii- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  complex, and an
asymmetric quadrupole doublet with parameters typical of highspin feiii [isomer shift delta = 0.49 mm/s and quadrupole splitting
parameter |deltaeq| = 0.88 mm/s (red line)] accounts for the lost
intensity. in particular, the isomer shift implies that the oxidation
state of the iron does not change during the reaction with hu.4
this new species was further characterized by its m€ossbauer

alternatively, the novel features can be simulated with two symmetric quadrupole doublets of equal intensity. the parameters (delta1 =
0.55 mm/s, deltaeq1 = 0.76 mm/s, delta2 = 0.46 mm/s, and deltaeq2 = 0.94 mm/s)
also support the assignment as high-spin feiii for both subsites.

in an external magnetic field of 53 mt oriented parallel to the gamma beam

feiii-containing diamagnetic species. the reaction of mniv/feiii- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx 
with hydrazine does not result in generation of the feiii-containing
diamagnetic species. to illustrate this, the spectra of the mniv/feiii
form (with 90% of the total intensity) are overlaid for the sake of
clarity as solid red lines. instead, a small amount of a high-spin feii
species (∼10%), which is evident from the weak absorption feature at
∼3 mm/s, is formed in the reaction with hydrazine.

spectra in applied fields of 4 and 8 t (figure 5). analysis of these
spectra reveals that the sample contains three components: mniv/
feiii- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  (57% intensity, blue lines), the new feiii-containing
complex (33% intensity, red lines), and a mononuclear high-spin
feiii impurity (10% intensity, green lines). the parameters used
for the simulation of the mniv/feiii- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  complex (see the legend of
figure 5) are slightly different from (but within 3% of) those
previously published (42), perhaps suggesting that this cluster
may access slightly different conformations, as we previously
suggested on the basis of observed variations in deltaeq (49). the
spectral features of the new feiii-containing species can be
satisfactorily simulated with the parameters (delta and deltaeq) determined from analysis of the low-field spectra (given above) and the
assumption that this complex has a diamagnetic (s = 0) electron
spin ground state.
we have considered three possibilities for the identity of the
diamagnetic, feiii-containing species. first and simplest, hu
could act as a two-electron reductant, converting the mniv/feiiibeta2 complex to a mnii/feiii- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  form, which would be expected to
have a diamagnetic ground state arising from antiferromagnetic
coupling between the mnii (smn = 5/2) and feiii (sfe = 5/2) ions.
however, given that the mnii/feii and mniii/feiii forms of  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx 
both react efficiently with h2o2 to produce mniii/feiii and
mniv/feiv complexes, respectively (49), we anticipated that a
mnii/feiii form should also react with h2o2, presumably to form
the mniv/feiii cluster. the diamagnetic complex does not react
efficiently with h2o2 (figure s2 of the supporting information).
moreover, treatment of mniv/feiii- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  with a different twoelectron reductant, hydrazine (n2h4), does not produce the
diamagnetic complex (figure 6). these considerations weigh
against a mnii/feiii assignment. second, the diamagnetic,
feiii-containing species could be an adduct between a formal

mniii/feiii cluster and no•. the mniii/feiii cluster could be
generated by one-electron reduction of the mniv/feiii form by
hu, which would yield an aminoxyl radical (37). the mniii/feiii
cluster could then react with no•, which is known to form in
solutions containing hu (53), to yield the mniii/feiii-no•
adduct. however, attempts to make the complex in high yield
by direct exposure of a solution of mniii/feiii- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  to no• were
unsuccessful: analysis of spectra of a sample prepared in this
manner (figure s3 of the supporting information) suggests that
only ∼10% of the total intensity can be attributed to the
characteristic quadrupole doublet. this observation provides
argument against the second possibility.
the third possibility, and the one that we favor, is that the
feiii-containing, diamagnetic complex generated in the reaction of mniv/feiii- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  with hu forms by slow one-electron reduction by hu of the mniv/feiii cluster to a mniii/feiii form followed by coordination of the hu-derived aminoxyl radical (37)
to the cluster, presumably to the feiii site to account for the
s = 0 ground state. such coordination of aminoxyl radicals to
transition metals has been reported (54, 55). the diamagnetic
ground state could then be rationalized by antiferromagnetic
interactions between the feiii (sfe = 5/2) and mniii (smn = 2) sites
and between the feiii site and the aminoxyl radical (saminoxyl = 1/2).
consistent with this hypothesis, other compounds containing an
n-oh group [nh2-oh, (ch3)2n-oh, and ch3-(co)nh-oh] also promote development of the quadrupole doublet

characteristic of the diamagnetic feiii-containing complex when
incubated with mniv/feiii- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  (figure 6). this structural explanation for the diamagnetic state requires direct access of the
n-oh bond-containing reductant to the cofactor, as previously
suggested for hu inactivation of ec  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  in isolation (i.e., not under
turnover conditions) (39).
roles of et pathway residues in the one-electron
reduction of the mniv/feiii cofactor. the roles of the
catalysis-specific pcet pathway residues in  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  (w51 and
y338) (47, 56) and r2 [y991, y990, and c672; residue numbers
reflect the sequence of the wild-type subunit (47) rather than his6delta(1-248)r2] and the activation-specific residue, y222, in  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  (46)
in mediating one-electron reduction of the mniv/feiii cofactor
by hu were probed by replacement of these residues, individually and in combination, with functionally incompetent surrogates (phenylalanine, f, for the w and y residues and serine, s,
for c672) (figure 1c). with the exception of  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -w51f (discussed
below), hu treatment of any of the various single variants in the
presence of cdp, atp, and the wild-type partner subunit gives
the homogeneous epr signal (figure 7). it is tempting to
conclude that the tyrosines of the pcet pathway have no role
in mediating the one-electron reduction, but the result with
the  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -y222f/y338f double variant shows otherwise. very little
epr intensity develops upon hu treatment of this double
variant in the presence of his6-delta(1-248)r2, cdp, and atp.
the fact that the resolved signal is readily generated by treatment
of mniv/feiii- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -y222f/y338f with the stronger reductant,
dt, in the presence of his6-delta(1-248)r2, cdp, and atp shows
that the double variant is inherently competent to undergo
whatever conformational change might be necessary to yield
the homogeneous mniii/feiii state upon binding to the his6delta(1-248)r2 3 cdp 3 atp complex. thus, either y222 or y338
in  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  (but not both) is required for the one-electron reduction
outcome effected by hu under turnover conditions. this observation is the best evidence available for the hypothesis
[advanced originally in studies of the ec class ia rnr (36, 38)
but never tested by validation of the expected pcet pathway
dependence] that hu can intercept a y• under turnover conditions. the inability of  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -w51f to support one-electron reduction of the mniv/feiii cluster by hu [although it does support
formation of the diamagnetic, formally two-electron-reduced
state (figure s4 of the supporting information)] is also consistent, as previous studies have shown that proper electron relay
function of both y222 and y338 depends on the presence of
w51 (46). in the case of this variant, the inability of dt to
generate the resolved signal suggests that w51 could have a role
in the conformational change required to form the homogeneous
mniii/feiii state, although caution is warranted in this conclusion because of the unconservative nature of the w51f substitution and the possibility that it might propagate structural changes
to other regions of the protein, perhaps preventing formation of
the homogeneous state. the fact that none of the pathway
residues in r2 is required to support formation of the resolved
epr signal implies that hu can act at the subunit interface
(figure 1c, black arrows), although the possibility that it can also
act within r2 cannot be excluded from the available data.
evidence for conformational gating of pcet in ct
rnr. among the major outstanding questions concerning the
function of class i rnrs are the mechanism of the multistep
pcet process and how it is gated by the protein. the hypothesis
of a conformational gate was initially founded on the dichotomy between the remarkable stability (many hours at room

jiang et al.
temperature) of the potently oxidizing y122• in ec  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx , even in
the presence of compounds such as ascorbate and thiols that are
clearly thermodynamically competent to reduce it, and the
relatively rapid turnover rate of the enzyme (5-10 s-1), which
would seem to require that c439 reduce the y122• in tens to
hundreds of milliseconds (5, 25). over the past decade, studies by
the stubbe group have provided a more direct demonstration of
the postulated conformational gating and have shown that
substrate binding is the key to opening the gate (20, 22, 23, 25).
kinetic studies suggested that a slow conformational change
prevents accumulation of reduced y122 (the immediate product
of pcet) in a single turnover and rate-limits substrate reduction (25). variants of  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  or r2 containing  xxxd2471xxx  (dopa) or 3-aminotyrosine (nh2-y) in place of one of the
pcet pathway y residues were shown to be capable of accumulating dopa• or nh2-y• pathway radicals (20, 22, 23). the
reduction potentials of these radicals are less than that of the y•,
meaning that reduction of the y122• by the engineered dopa or
nh2-y pathway residue is thermodynamically favored. nevertheless, pcet effectively does not proceed or proceeds very
sluggishly until substrate is added. thus, substrate binding opens
the pcet gate and allows the favored reaction to proceed at a
kinetically competent rate.
such elegant resolution of steps in the intersubunit pcet has
not yet been achieved for ct rnr, so the notion that it is also
conformationally gated remains a working hypothesis. nevertheless, the hypothesis is now supported by a wealth of circumstantial evidence. the ct enzyme is similar to the ec protein in
that the oxidized cofactor is quite stable (for at least hours) in the
free  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  subunit in the presence of thiols but must accept an
electron (presumably) from c672 in ∼1 s to account for the
turnover number of ∼0.6 s-1 (46, 47). in addition, cdp is
required for production of the mniii/feiii complex with the wellresolved epr signal when either dt or hu is used to reduce the
active mniv/feiii state, and the latter reductant generates a
distinct, diamagnetic product in the absence of substrate. the
kinetics of hu reduction under turnover conditions are also
consistent with data for ec rnr suggesting that the opening of
the gate is rate-limiting for turnover. the observed “saturation”
of the apparent first-order rate constant for the reaction with
increasing hu concentration is most simply interpreted according to a mechanism in which (i) cdp (present in the syringe with
hu) binds to his6-delta(1-248)r2 in its complex with  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx , (ii) a ratelimiting conformational change opens the gate and allows for
propagation of the oxidizing equivalent from the mniv ion of the
cofactor into the pathway, and (iii) hu then reduces a pathway
radical to trap the cofactor in the mniii/feiii state. according
to this mechanism, saturation with respect to hu concentration
reflects the approach to 100% efficiency in trapping of the
pathway radical by hu, and the limiting value of the rate
constant (0.7 ( 0.1 s-1) for hu reduction reflects the rate
constant for the gate-opening conformational change. this rate
constant is, within error, twice the value of the turnover number
under similar reaction conditions (0.4 s-1). if one assumes that
only one monomer of the  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  homodimer can be active at a time,
which is indicated by the kinetic and spectroscopic data on the
hu reaction described in this work, then these two values agree
well. on this basis, we tentatively propose that the ct enzyme may
be rate-limited in a single turnover and the steady state by a slow
conformational change occurring after binding of the substrate,
which has been shown more rigorously by stubbe and co-workers
for the ec enzyme (20, 22, 23, 25).

article
location and nature of the pcet gate. if the interpretations given above are accepted, then the unique aspects of the
ct enzyme and its reaction with hu provide additional insight
concerning the location and nature of the pcet gate. in the
reaction of the ec enzyme with hu, a ∼10-fold difference in
the rate of y122• reduction under resting and turnover conditions (36) is the sole experimental manifestation of the postulated
y• interception mechanism. thus, one would anticipate a 10-fold
diminution (at most) in the rate of the reaction in a pathwaydisrupted variant, were similar experiments to be performed on
the ec enzyme. by contrast, the ct reaction has two spectroscopically distinguishable products and a ∼900-fold difference
in the rates of the reaction pathways leading to them. these
features permit clearer definition of the requirements for the
y• interception mechanism and opening of the pcet gate.
more importantly, the existence of two intersecting electron relay
systems connecting the surface of  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  to the buried cofactor
(the w51-y338 pathway employed in catalytic pcet and the
w51-y222 pathway involved only in activation), a feature that is
apparently unique to the ct system among all class i rnrs that
have been studied to date, provides a unique probe for the location
of the gate. although conformational transduction of the binding
of the substrate to the opening of the pcet gate almost certainly
involves an extensive network of interactions spanning both
subunits, the actual gating mechanism could involve (i) primarily
the electron-accepting mniv/feiii cofactor (e.g., by promoting
an increase in its effective reduction potential), (ii) primarily
the electron-donating c672 (e.g., by promoting an increase in
its effective oxidation potential), (iii) primarily the mediating
pathway (e.g., by modification of the disposition of component residues to engage the pathway), or (iv) some combination of these elements. the observation that substituting any
of the pathway y residues does not prevent generation of the
mniii/feiii product by hu implies that none of these residues
plays a critical role in pcet gating. more specifically, the simplest
interpretation of the observation that y222 supports formation of
mniii/feiii- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  in the absence of the subunit interfacial pcet
pathway residue, y338, in a substrate-gated fashion (figure s5 of
the supporting information) is that opening of the gate permits
propagation of the oxidizing equivalent from the mniv ion onto
the off-pathway y222, generating a y222• that is quenched by
hu. this conclusion is somewhat surprising, as y222 has no role
in catalytic pcet [as evidenced by the absence of an effect of the
y222f substitution on the catalytic activity (46)] and would not
necessarily be expected to communicate with the cofactor in a
gated fashion. it is thus also quite informative, implying that gate
opening induces a “pull” from the mniv that is sufficiently strong
to draw an electron from the off-pathway residue, if the intended
target (y338) is not present. thus, the gating mechanism probably
involves an increase in the effective reduction potential of the
cofactor, and the gate is probably located close to the cofactor.
what is the nature of the gate? stubbe, nocera, and co-workers
have proposed for ec rnr that a proton from the  xxxd630xxx -coordinated water is transferred to the y122 phenolic oxygen to increase
the effective reduction potential of the y• and the proton from the
indole nh group of w48 is transferred to  xxxd237xxx  to decrease the
potential of the w48 radical (blue arrows in figure 1a), permitting
migration of the radical from its resting position on y122 onto
w48 (5, 24). we have proposed a derivative mechanism by which
dynamic control of proton transfers might also gate pcet in the
mn/fe-dependent ct rnr [figure 1b (44)]. this mechanism is
founded on x-ray absorption data, which revealed the presence

of a (mu-oxo)(mu-hydroxo)-bridged mniv/feiii cluster in ct  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  (57).
we proposed that protonation of the mu-oxo group yielding
a bis(mu-hydroxo)-bridged cluster could increase the reduction
potential of the mniv site to open the gate. by contrast, a recent
computational study proposed that forward pcet is coupled to
protonation of the hydroxo bridge, resulting in a (mu-oxo)(mu-aqua)mniii/feiii cluster (58). experiments to distinguish among these
two models and other alternatives using electron nuclear double
resonance (endor) spectroscopy on the well-resolved epr
signal of the mniii/feiii state are ongoing. the pathway and
mechanism by which the substrate binding event is transduced the
estimated 35 å across the subunit interface to control the relevant
proton transfers and open the gate remain to be elucidated.
