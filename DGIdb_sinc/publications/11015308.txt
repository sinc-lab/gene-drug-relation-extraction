1 contractile responses to ergotamine, sumatriptan and the novel  xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonists,
ly334370 and ly344864 were examined using the rabbit saphenous vein.
2 ergotamine (pec50=8.7+0.06) was 30 fold more potent than 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht)
(pec50=7.2+0.13) and 300 fold more potent than sumatriptan (pec50=6.0+0.08) in contracting
the rabbit saphenous vein in vitro. the selective  xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonists, ly334370 or ly344864
(up to 1074 m), did not contract the rabbit saphenous vein.
3 the contractile response to ergotamine in this tissue resulted from activation of both  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  and
 xxxg1109xxx /1d receptors based on the observation that  xxxd3000xxx  (1076 m), an a-adrenoceptor antagonist,
and gr127935 (1078 m) a  xxxg1109xxx /1d receptor antagonist, dextrally shifted the contractile response
to ergotamine. in contrast,  xxxd3000xxx  (1076 m) did not alter contraction to sumatriptan whereas
gr127935 (1078 m) was a potent antagonist (7log kb=10.0) suggesting that sumatriptan-induced
contraction of the rabbit saphenous vein was mediated only by activation of receptors similar or
identical to  xxxg1109xxx /1d receptors.
4  xxxd1902xxx  (361077 m) produced a modest increase (approximately 5.0 ± 10.0% maximum  xxxd1902xxx 
contraction) in saphenous vein force. precontraction with  xxxd1902xxx  (361077 m) dramatically
augmented the potency and maximal contractile response to sumatriptan (pec50=7.1) and
modestly enhanced the contractile potency of ergotamine (pec50=9.0) in the rabbit saphenous
vein. however,  xxxd1902xxx  (361077 m) only unmasked a contraction to the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonists
when concentrations exceeded 1075 m, concentrations considerably higher than their  xxxg1112xxx 
receptor anities.
5 ly334370 (1076 m) pretreatment did not alter contraction to either sumatriptan or ergotamine
and a higher concentration (1075 m) of ly334370 or ly344864 inhibited contraction to
sumatriptan.
6 thus, activation of  xxxg1112xxx  receptors will not induce vascular contraction (either alone or
following modest tone with  xxxd1902xxx ) or augment contraction to other contractile agonists in the
rabbit saphenous vein.

introduction
both ergotamine and sumatriptan are  xxxd2022xxx  therapies
that also contract human coronary arteries. in fact,
ergotamine-induced coronary arterial contraction has been
used as a diagnostic test to detect patients with prinzmetal's
angina (mantle et al., 1981). in part, the vascular contractile
eect of ergotamine and sumatriptan has been attributed to the
ability of these agents to activate 5-htib/id receptors in
vascular tissue. in contrast to sumatriptan, ergotamine may
also interact with a-adrenoceptors both as an agonist and/or
antagonist dependent on the vascular bed (silberstein, 1997).
recently, selective 5-htif receptor agonists have been
proposed as eective  xxxd2022xxx  therapies (johnson et al.,
1998) that possess minimal propensity to cause coronary
arterial vasocontraction or to interact with a-adrenoceptors
(cohen & schenck, 1999). however, data are emerging to

suggest that induction of a modest degree of tone in vascular
preparations can enhance the response to other vasocontractile
agonists such as sumatriptan (maclennan & martin, 1992;
maclean et al., 1994; yildiz & tuncer 1995; maassen
vandenbrink et al., 1996; smith et al., 1996; cohen &
schenck 1999). the interaction of  xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonists
with other vasoactive agents has not been extensively
examined.
the rabbit saphenous vein is a convenient in vitro model for
responses that mimic those observed with human cerebral and
coronary blood vessels (cohen et al., 1997). using this
preparation, the present studies were designed to explore (1)
the receptors involved in ergotamine and sumatriptan-induced
contraction of the rabbit saphenous vein, and (2) potential
interactions of the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonists with ergotamine
and sumatriptan. ly344864 (phebus et al., 1997) and
ly334370 (johnson et al., 1997) were used as our prototypic
 xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonists. for comparative purposes, the eect

of  xxxd1902xxx , an agent known to potentiate contractile responses
to sumatriptan (yildiz & tuncer, 1994; cohen & schenck
1999) was also explored for its eect on vascular contraction to
ergotamine and the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonists.

methods
isolation of vascular tissue
male new zealand white rabbits (1.5 ± 3.0 kg) (myrtles
rabbitry, thompson station, tn, u.s.a.) were sacri®ced by a
lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital (200 mg) injected into the
ear vein. the saphenous vein was dissected free of connective
tissue, cannulated in situ with polyethylene tubing (pe no 50),
placed in petri dishes containing krebs' bicarbonate buer (see
below), and ring preparations were obtained.
tissues were mounted in organ baths containing 10 ml of
modi®ed krebs' solution of the following composition
(millimolar concentrations): nacl, 118.2; kcl, 4.6; cacl2
2h2o, 1.6; kh2po4, 1.2;  xxxd2534xxx , 1.2; dextrose, 10.0; and
nahco3, 24.8. tissue bath solutions were maintained at 378c
and aerated with 95% o2 and 5% co2 (ph=7.4). an initial
optimum resting force of 4 g was applied to the rabbit
saphenous vein as determined in preliminary length tension
studies using kcl (67 mm) challenge. isometric contractions
were recorded as changes in grams of force on a beckman
dynograph with statham uc-3 transducers or with a
macintosh-compatible data acquisition system (biopac
systems, inc., santa barbara, ca, u.s.a.). tissues were
allowed to equilibrate 1 to 2 h before exposure to compounds.

experimental protocol
cumulative agonist concentration-response curves were
generated and no tissue was used to generate more than one
agonist concentration-response curve. tissues precontracted
with  xxxd1902xxx  (361076 m) did not relax to acetylcholine
(1076 m) indicating the absence of an intact endothelium
(removed by rotating a cannula in the lumen). in some
experiments, tissues were precontracted [7.62+2.76% (n=12)
of a maximal kcl response] with  xxxd1902xxx  (361077 m) prior to
initiating a response to sumatriptan, ergotamine, ly344864 or
ly334370. initial studies have documented that this minimal
contractile concentration of  xxxd1902xxx  markedly augmented
contraction to sumatriptan in the rabbit saphenous vein
(cohen & schenck, 1999). in other experiments, tissues were
pre-exposed to vehicle,  xxxd3000xxx  (1076 m), gr127935
(1078 m), the combination of  xxxd3000xxx  and gr127935,
ly344864 or ly334370 for 1 h prior to initiating a response
to sumatriptan or ergotamine. all results are expressed as
mean+s.e.mean where n represents the number of tissues
examined. the data are expressed as a percentage of the
response to a maximal contractile concentration of kcl
(67 mm) administered initially in each tissue. in tissues
precontracted with  xxxd1902xxx  (361077 m), force produced by the
second agonist was measured using the precontracted force as
baseline. the 7log ec50 values (pec50) were determined by
least-squares linear regression analysis of the linear portion of
the generated concentration-response curves taking maximal
response as 100%.

drugs and solutions
prostaglandin f2a and acetylcholine chloride were purchased
from sigma chemical company (st. louis, mo, u.s.a.) and

sumatriptan, ergotamine and  xxxg1112xxx  agonists

ergotamine was purchased from research biochemicals, inc.
(natick, ma, u.s.a.).  xxxd3000xxx  hydrochloride was a gift from
p®zer laboratories (groton, ct, u.s.a.). sumatriptan,
gr127935, ly334864 and ly334370 were provided by the
lilly research laboratories (indianapolis, in, u.s.a.). stock
solutions (1072 ± 1073 m) of gr127935, sumatriptan,
ly334864 and ly334370 were prepared in de-ionized distilled
water with 2 ± 10% 0.1 n hcl.  xxxd3000xxx  and  xxxd1902xxx  were
prepared in de-ionized distilled water. ergotamine (1073 m)
was prepared in 2% dsmo and 0.1 n hcl. subsequent
dilutions were prepared in de-ionized distilled water.

results
contractile responses to ergotamine, 5-ht, sumatriptan
and 5-htif receptor agonists
ergotamine (pec50=8.7+0.06), 5-ht (pec50=7.2+0.13)
and sumatriptan (pec50=6.0+0.08) produced concentration
dependent contractile eects in the rabbit saphenous vein
(figure 1). ergotamine was approximately 30 and 300 fold
more potent than 5-ht and sumatriptan as a contractile
agonist in the saphenous vein and produced a maximal
response that was approximately 50% greater than that of
sumatriptan. in contrast to these agonists that markedly
contracted the rabbit saphenous vein, the selective  xxxg1112xxx 
receptor agonists did not signi®cantly contract the rabbit
saphenous vein in concentrations as high as 1074 m (figure 1).

antagonism of contraction to ergotamine and
sumatriptan
to understand further the receptors mediating the contractile
responses to both ergotamine and sumatriptan, we examined
the eect of  xxxd3000xxx  (1076 m) and the  xxxg1109xxx /1d receptor
antagonist gr127935 (1078 m) on the responses to sumatriptan and ergotamine in the rabbit saphenous vein. although
 xxxd3000xxx  did not alter the contractile response to sumatriptan
(figure 2),  xxxd3000xxx  did inhibit the contractile concentration
response to ergotamine in a biphasic fashion. contraction to
low concentrations (51079 m) of ergotamine was not altered
by  xxxd3000xxx . however, contraction to higher ergotamine

concentrations (41079 m) was dextrally shifted by  xxxd3000xxx 
(1076 m). thus, a1-adrenoceptors are involved in vascular
contraction to high concentrations (41079 m) of ergotamine,
but not in the contraction produced by low ergotamine
concentrations (figure 2).
in contrast, gr127935 produced a marked dextral shift in
the
contractile
response
to
sumatriptan
(7log
kb=10.04+0.08; n=4) suggesting that receptors similar to
or identical to  xxxg1109xxx /1d receptors participate in the vascular
contractions produced by sumatriptan (figure 3). however,
gr127935 (1078 m) had no eect on the contractile response
to ergotamine in the absence of a-adrenoceptor blockade
(figure 3). in the presence of both antagonists, the response to
ergotamine was shifted monophasically, consistent with the
contractile response to ergotamine resulting from activation of
both alpha and  xxxg1109xxx /1d receptors in the rabbit saphenous
vein (compare figure 2, bottom panel and figure 4).

response to sumatriptan (pec50=7.08+0.01 m) and a more
modest augmentation of the contractile response to ergotamine (pec50=9.0+0.03 m) (figure 5). in contrast to these
marked eects, pretreatment of tissues with  xxxd1902xxx 
(361077 m) to produce a modest tone in the rabbit saphenous
vein only enhanced the contractile response to the  xxxg1112xxx 
receptor agonists when the concentration of the agonist was
equal to or exceeded 1075 m (figure 6). in these high
concentrations, it is likely that the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonists
may be activating the  xxxg1109xxx /1d contractile receptor in this
preparation. furthermore, even with vascular tone augmented
by  xxxd1902xxx , the potency of the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonists was
considerably less than the contractile potency of sumatriptan
alone.

eect of  xxxd1902xxx  to augment contractile responses
because  xxxd1902xxx  can augment contractile responses to sumatriptan (yildiz & tuncer, 1994; cohen & schenck 1999), we
compared the eect of  xxxd1902xxx  (361077 m) precontraction on
contractile responses to both ergotamine and sumatriptan.
 xxxd1902xxx  produced a profound augmentation of the contractile

lastly, we examined the eects of ly334370 pretreatment on
the contractile responses to sumatriptan and ergotamine.
ly334370 (1076 m) neither augmented nor inhibited contraction to sumatriptan or ergotamine (data not shown). to
examine the eects of these  xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonists further,
we utilized even higher concentrations (1075 m) of both
ly334370 and ly344864 (figure 7). in high concentrations,

neither agonist (1075 m) augmented the contractile response to
sumatriptan. however, each agonist (1075 m) inhibited the
contractile response to sumatriptan.

discussion
although ergotamine and sumatriptan are ecacious in the
treatment of migraine headache, the cardiovascular liabilities
of these agents limit their more wide spread utility and
acceptance (yasue et al., 1981; bax & saxena, 1993; chester et
al., 1993; macintyre et al., 1993; koh et al., 1994). both
sumatriptan and ergotamine are relatively potent agonists of
coronary arterial vasoconstriction (maassen vandenbrink et
al., 1998). this cardiovascular liability of these drugs has
prompted the identi®cation of alternative  xxxd2022xxx  therapy
lacking vasoconstrictor potential. to this end, ly344864 and
ly334370 were developed as prototypic high anity and
selective  xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonists. although a recent report
has emerged suggesting that ly334370 possesses signi®cant  xxxg1108xxx  receptor eects (dupuis et al., 1998), previous studies
that also documented high  xxxg1108xxx  anity
(ki=12 nm) in cloned cell lines did not detect marked in vitro
or in vivo functional eects associated with  xxxg1108xxx 
activation (overshiner et al., 1996). nevertheless, both
ly344864 and ly334370 were eective in inhibiting
trigeminal-induced dural extravasation in animal models of
migraine (johnson et al., 1997; phebus et al., 1997) and
ly334370 demonstrated ecacy in clinical migraine (oen et
al., 1999).
with the identi®cation of  xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonists and
their utility in migraine, the rabbit saphenous vein, a tissue
whose responses to sumatriptan are thought to mimic the
responses to sumatriptan in human coronary arteries (cohen
et al., 1997), was used to understand whether  xxxg1112xxx  receptor
agonists exhibit vasocontractile properties. furthermore, the
rabbit saphenous vein possesses a-adrenoceptors (daly et al.,
1988a,b) in addition to  xxxg1109xxx /1d receptors which have been
implicated in the vascular eects of ergotamine (mikkelsen et
al., 1981). thus, the rabbit saphenous vein aords a model to
understand the role of serotonergic versus a-adrenoceptors in
the response to triptans, ergotamine and  xxxg1112xxx  receptor
agonists.
contraction to ergotamine resulted from activation of both
 xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  and  xxxg1109xxx /1d receptors in the rabbit saphenous vein.
this conclusion was based on the demonstration that
contraction to low concentrations of ergotamine (1079 m and
lower) was resistant to  xxxd3000xxx  blockade, whereas contraction
to higher concentrations of ergotamine was markedly inhibited
by  xxxd3000xxx . thus, in high concentrations, ergotamine
contracted the rabbit saphenous vein by activation of a1adrenoceptors. further evidence for this dual contractile
mechanism was obtained by documenting a marked dextral
shift in the contractile response to ergotamine by the
combination of gr127935 and  xxxd3000xxx . under these
conditions, contraction to low concentrations of ergotamine
was dramatically inhibited consistent with the ®nding that
ergotamine has exceptionally high anity for the cloned 5ht1b (k1=0.03 nm) and  xxxg1110xxx  (k1=0.07 nm) receptors
(hamblin et al., 1992). these data underscore the marked
heterogeneity in mechanisms of vasoconstriction to ergotamine. previous studies in human blood vessels documented
contractile responses to ergotamine that were resistant to aadrenoceptor blockade but inhibited by 5-ht receptor
antagonists (mikkelsen et al., 1981). in contrast, in vivo studies
using canine external carotid vasoconstriction revealed a

sumatriptan, ergotamine and  xxxg1112xxx  agonists

marked contractile eect of ergotamine mediated by
 xxxg1109xxx /1d receptors as well as a2-adrenoceptors, but not a1adrenoceptors (villalon et al., 1999). clearly, the eects of
ergotamine are highly dependent upon the receptor densities
present in speci®c vascular beds (muller-schweinitzer, 1982).
in contrast to the marked contractile potency of ergotamine
in the rabbit saphenous vein, sumatriptan was approximately
300 fold less potent than ergotamine, producing a maximal
response that was approximately 50% of the maximal
contraction to ergotamine. furthermore, sumatriptan was a
highly selective agonist at the  xxxg1109xxx /1d receptor in the rabbit
saphenous vein based on the observation that  xxxd3000xxx 
(1076 m) did not alter the contractile response to sumatriptan,
whereas gr127935 (1078 m) potently inhibited contraction to
sumatriptan. these data are consistent with previous studies
documenting the  xxxg1109xxx /1d receptor interactions of sumatriptan (razzaque et al., 1995; terron 1996; cohen et al.,
1999).
the rabbit saphenous vein markedly contracted to
sumatriptan, 5-ht and ergotamine, yet the selective  xxxg1112xxx 
receptor agonists, ly334370 and ly344864 did not contract
the rabbit saphenous vein from baseline force in concentrations up to 1074 m. although ly334370 and ly344864 did
not contract the saphenous vein,  xxxg1112xxx  receptor mrna has
been detected in the rabbit saphenous vein (bard et al., 1996)
suggesting a potential role of  xxxg1112xxx  receptor protein in
vascular tissue. to examine this further, we took advantage of
the observation that vascular tissue can exhibit augmented
contractile force to serotonergic agonists following exposure to
low concentrations of other agonists (stupecky et al., 1986;
yildiz et al., 1998). based on this, we questioned whether the
presence of a modest force in the tissue could unmask a
contractile response to the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonists.  xxxd1902xxx 
(361077 m) was used to induce a modest force (approximately
5 ± 10% of its maximal response) in the saphenous vein prior to
exposure either to sumatriptan, ergotamine or a  xxxg1112xxx 
receptor agonist. in the presence of  xxxd1902xxx  (361077 m), the
contractile response to sumatriptan was markedly augmented
(see figure 5). the eect of  xxxd1902xxx  on sumatriptan-induced
contraction in the saphenous vein is consistent with previous
reports using rabbit mesenteric and iliac arteries (yildiz &
tuncer, 1994).
in contrast, contraction to ergotamine was not markedly
altered by preconstriction with  xxxd1902xxx . it is possible that
responses to ergotamine, which was an exceptionally potent
contractile agonist in the rabbit saphenous vein, could not be
further enhanced or alternatively, that  xxxd1902xxx  can dramatically
augment the contractile response mediated by  xxxg1109xxx /1d
receptors and only to a lesser extent, augment a-adrenoceptor
responses in the rabbit saphenous vein. this later hypothesis is
consistent with the idea that ampli®cation occurs as a result of
cross talk between two g-protein coupled receptors with gicoupled receptors able to amplify gq-coupled responses
(maclean, 1999). thus,  xxxd1902xxx , which activates gq-coupled
responses is less likely or able to amplify responses which are
also gq-coupled such as the a1-adrenoceptor component of
ergotamine-induced contraction whereas  xxxd1902xxx  is able to
dramatically amplify the gi-coupled sumatriptan response.
in spite of the marked augmentation of sumatriptaninduced contraction,  xxxd1902xxx  (361077 m) did not unmask
contraction to either of the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonists in
concentrations of 1075 m or lower. these concentrations were
sucient to markedly stimulate  xxxg1112xxx  receptors with
pki=8.8 and 8.2 for ly334370 and ly344864, respectively
(johnson et al., 1998). only when concentrations exceeded
1075 m, was there an apparent unmasking of a contractile

m.l. cohen & k. schenck

response to  xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonists. under augmented
conditions, the contractile response observed using high
concentrations of  xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonists may re¯ect an
improved sensitivity to detect the ability of high concentrations
of these agents to activate  xxxg1109xxx /1d or similar receptors in the
rabbit saphenous vein.
because responses to sumatriptan and to a lesser extent to
ergotamine could be augmented in the rabbit saphenous vein,
we examined the ability of ly334370 and ly344864 to
enhance or augment the contractile response to sumatriptan
and ergotamine in the rabbit saphenous vein. pre-incubation
with ly334370 (1076 m) did not alter the contractile response
to sumatriptan or ergotamine under conditions that resulted in
augmented contraction by  xxxd1902xxx . we extended these studies
with a higher concentration of  xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonist
(1075 m) and again, no augmentation to sumatriptan-induced
contraction occurred. in fact, ly344864 and ly334370
(1075 m) modestly inhibited contraction to sumatriptan. thus,
these studies with two independent  xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonists
are consistent with the contention that  xxxg1112xxx  receptor
agonists do not exert marked eects on vascular smooth
muscle contractility.

in summary, ergotamine and sumatriptan, like 5-ht,
contracted the rabbit saphenous vein with contraction
mediated by  xxxg1109xxx /1d receptors for sumatriptan and by both
 xxxg1109xxx /1d and a1-adrenoceptors for ergotamine. contraction
to ergotamine and sumatriptan was augmented by low
concentrations of  xxxd1902xxx . in contrast, the selective  xxxg1112xxx 
receptor agonists, ly344864 and ly334370 did not contract
the rabbit saphenous vein and only produced a small
contraction in the presence of  xxxd1902xxx  when their  xxxg1112xxx 
receptor agonist concentration exceeded 1075 m. furthermore,
 xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonists did not augment contractile response
to sumatriptan, but rather, high concentrations (1075 m) of
ly344864 and ly334370 inhibited sumatriptan-induced
contractility. these studies support the contention that
selective  xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonists exert minimal, if any
vascular contractile agonist ecacy, in marked contrast to
sumatriptan and ergotamine.
