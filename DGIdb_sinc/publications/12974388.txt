the activator-binding site of onchocerca volvulus  xxxd3156xxx  decarboxylase, a potential drug target.   xxxd3156xxx  decarboxylase ( xxxg152xxx ) is a key enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis. in many eukaryotes its activity is stimulated specifically by putrescine. the  xxxg152xxx  of the filarial parasite onchocerca volvulus, however, is not only stimulated by putrescine but also by the naturally occuring polyamines spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx . several diamines, acetylated polyamines and polyamine analogues were used to analyse what molecular prerequisites are needed to stimulate nematode  xxxg152xxx  activity. in the absence of an activator, the o. volvulus enzyme exhibits an extremely low specific activity. this fact, together with the unspecificity of activator binding, was thought to be useful for a new strategy to inhibit nematode  xxxg152xxx  activity. therefore, different polyamine analogues were tested as competitive inhibitors towards the stimulatory effect putrescine has on the o. volvulus and, in comparison, on the caenorhabditis elegans and human  xxxg152xxx . bis(aralkyl)- and bis(alkyl)-substituted polyamine analogues with a 3-7-3 backbone were found to inhibit  xxxg152xxx  activities, however, probably without interfering with the putrescine stimulation. the best inhibitor, bw-1, was about 10-fold more effective against o. volvulus  xxxg152xxx  than against the human enzyme. unexpectedly, bw-1 was determined to be a competitive inhibitor with respect to  xxxd3156xxx , having a ki value of 310 microm for the putrescine-stimulated human  xxxg152xxx . furthermore, we show for the o. volvulus and the human enzyme that the degree of inhibition by bw-1 depends on the actual putrescine concentration.
