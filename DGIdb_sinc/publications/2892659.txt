 xxxd236xxx : a long-acting, nonsedating antihistamine
patrice m. krstenansky and robert j. cluxton, jr.

abstract:  xxxd236xxx  is a long-acting, highly selective
histamine i-receptor antagonist with minimal central and
anticholinergic effects. comparison studies have shown  xxxd236xxx 
to be equal or superior to currently available antihistamines,
beclomethasone nasal spray, and  xxxd1763xxx  sodium in relieving
allergic symptoms of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis. other
uses include treatment of allergic conjunctivitis and chronic
urticaria.  xxxd236xxx  is not as effective for treatment of acute
allergic symptoms because of its delayed onset of action.  xxxd236xxx 
and its active metabolite, desmethylastemizole, have long
elimination half-lives permitting once-daily dosing. the incidence of
sedation is lower than with conventional antihistamines, but
increased appetite and weight gain do occur.  xxxd236xxx  should be
useful for both maintenance and prophylactic therapy in patients
with chronic allergic conditions who cannot tolerate the sedative or
anticholinergic effects of conventional antihistamines.

pharmacology and toxicity
pharmacological studies performed in animals have
shown  xxxd236xxx  to be a histamine i antagonist exhibiting little blood-brain barrier penetration. it has a higher
affinity for lung histamine-receptors than for cerebellar histamine.vreceptors, which may explain the lower
incidence of central nervous system (ens) effects in
humans. it has no affinity for the acetylcholine receptors and is devoid of beta-adrenergic activity. at high
doses there is evidence of serotonin antagonism and
affinity for alpha-adrenergic receptors.v"
 xxxd236xxx  has a large therapeutic index (median
lethal dose/median effective dose > 2000) in dogs." a
volunteer took  xxxd236xxx  300 mg in kinetic studies with
no reported adverse effects. 7 there have been only two
reports of overdose with  xxxd236xxx  in humans, one
involving a 14-year-old patient who ingested  xxxd236xxx 
200 mg and exhibited drowsiness for 12 hours with no
anticholinergic symptoms." a 16-year-old who also
took 200 mg experienced 17 episodes of ventricular
tachycardia, a prolonged qtc interval of 0.65 seconds,
and torsade de pointes. the patient responded to an
 xxxd2401xxx  infusion, and after discharge had a normal qtc interval."
tachyphylaxis has not been reported to date with
 xxxd236xxx . no decrease in therapeutic response has
occurred in patients treated for up to one year, 10
whereas several studies have shown a loss of terfenadine
effectiveness after two to four weeks of therapy.1i·12
however, reports of tachyphylaxis with terfenadine
have been disputed in the literature based on possible
problems with study design, dose, and drug bioavailability.""

absorption

 xxxd236xxx  is rapidly and completely absorbed from
the gastrointestinal tract. 2 when administered in doses
of 10, 20, or 30 mg as a solution, suspension, or tablet,
 xxxd236xxx  showed no significant difference in time to
peak concentrations or area under the curve. since no
intravenous human studies have been done, absolute
bioavailability must be calculated in order to estimate
the oral bioavailability of 3 percent in humans. 16 a meal
has been shown to reduce bioavailability by 60 percent
and delay the time to peak concentration, and therefore
it is recommended that oral doses be taken one hour
before or two hours after a meal. 15 serum  xxxd236xxx 
and desmethylastemizole levels are proportional and
linear in doses of 10-30 mg/d. no evidence of enzyme
saturation or change in half-life was observed with a

 xxxd236xxx 

al. used an estimated vd of 45 l/kg to calculate an intravenous clearance of approximately 1.5 lzrnin." the
large discrepancy between the two values for vd is probably because the value in the heykants et al. study was
calculated based on a number of assumptions and an
estimated bioavailability.
metabolism

 xxxd236xxx  undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. at least nine metabolites have been identified in
humans,' with the three major metabolic pathways (figure 1) quantitatively equal in importance. the major
plasma metabolite, desmethylastemizole, demonstrates
anti histaminic potency similar to the parent compound. 7
it is excreted primarily in the feces, along with the
hydroxylated metabolites that undergo glucuronide conjugation. thus, enterohepatic recirculation of desmethylastemizole and conjugated metabolites may contribute
to the prolonged duration of therapeutic effect.":"
norastemizole, the major urinary metabolite, and the
hydroxylated metabolites are less potent and shorter
acting. 15
elimination

virtually no unchanged  xxxd236xxx  appears in the
urine or feces and all metabolites are slowly eliminated.' plasma levels of  xxxd236xxx  are so low that terminal phase half-life is reported as the combination of
 xxxd236xxx  and active desmethylastemizole. as seen in
table 1, mean half-life ranges from 9.2 to 13 days with
single doses':" and 18 to 20 days after long-term administration (two weeks to five months). 7  xxxd236xxx  is not
considered a pro-drug since the parent drug has affinity
for histamine.-receptors.':"
clinical studies
when compared with placebo  xxxd236xxx  has been
effective in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis.v"?"

allergic conjunctivitis," perennial allergic rhinitis,"
chronic urticaria, and angioedema.v-" comparison
studies with conventional antihistamines are summarized in table 2. 2 5 - 29 as there is no standard objective
method of measuring severity of allergic symptoms,
subjective assessment by means of scoring symptoms
and patient diaries are generally used to assess effectiveness of the drug and side effects. it is difficult to determine the accuracy of these measurements. also, most
studies were performed in small populations. larger
studies need to be performed to accurately determine
effectiveness. overall, it appears that  xxxd236xxx  is as
effective or slightly more effective than conventional
antihistamines. crossover studies have not been performed with  xxxd236xxx  in hay fever patients because
the combination of a short hay fever season and the
length of time it takes  xxxd236xxx  and metabolites to
clear the body makes such a study difficult, if not
impossible, to conduct.
terfenadine is the only nonsedating antihistamine
available in the u.s. comparison trials performed with
terfenadine are summarized in table 3. 11 , 12 ,3 0 - 3 3 in all
studies  xxxd236xxx  was equal or superior to terfenadine
in relieving itching, watery eyes, sneezing, and runny
nose. one study has been criticized because placebo was
more effective than terfenadine in relieving nasal blockage and runny nose, and because of a 27 percent dropout rate.!' neither terfenadine nor  xxxd236xxx  are very
effective in relieving nasal blockage, probably because
nasal blockage is mediated by histaminej-receptors in
the nasal vasculature. ii adding  xxxd294xxx  spray 200 p,g bid has decreased the incidence of
nasal blockage. 34
 xxxd236xxx  has been shown to be equal or superior to
 xxxd294xxx " and  xxxd1763xxx  sodium
in patients with hay fever," and as effective as  xxxd294xxx  in patients with skin-test-positive rhinitis."

lergic conditions. it has been shown to be effective in
asthma 3 8 . 3 9 and chronic vertigo;";" but because these
studies were performed in small patient populations,
further work needs to be done. sedative antihistamines
appear to be more effective than  xxxd236xxx  in treatment of non-histamine,-mediated itching."
adverse effects and drug interactions

a list of reported adverse effects of  xxxd236xxx  and
placebo in published clinical trials is summarized in
table 4. 4 3 adverse effects that appear to occur more
frequently with  xxxd236xxx  than with placebo include
cns sedation/depression, weight gain, and increased
appetite.  xxxd236xxx  appears to have a decreased incidence of anticholinergic side effects relative to other
antihistamines as evidenced by the relatively low incidence of dry mouth (0.6 percent), compared with placebo (3.8 percent). a significant percentage of patients
in the placebo groups experience sedation, indicating a
possible preconditioning of subjects to expect these side
effects with antihistamine therapy.
sedation and cns depression are the most frequently
reported side effects. in most studies the incidence of
sedation is lower than with conventional antihistamines
and comparable to that observed in placebo-treated
patients. however, in a six-week placebo and active treatment controlled clinical trial, sedation was reported by
31.03 percent of patients receiving  xxxd236xxx  10 mg/d.
one of the patients in this trial had excessive drowsiness
that lasted for 36 hours after discontinuing  xxxd236xxx .
an additional three patients reported drowsiness persisting for up to two weeks after discontinuation of  xxxd236xxx . the authors postulate the higher incidence of
sedation in this study may be genetic, since this is the first
 xxxd236xxx  study performed in a non-caucasian population." in a double-blind comparison trial in students

with allergic rhinitis, rombaut et al. reported a 53 percent incidence of sedation in the  xxxd236xxx  group compared with 67 percent in the terfenadine group. 32
in reviewing 50  xxxd236xxx  double-blind trials, vanden bussche et al. reported an incidence of cns depression of only 6.9 percent for  xxxd236xxx  compared with
7.2 percent for placebo." they did not cite all 50 trials
and we presume some must be from unpublished data.
also, this study did not include the above-mentioned
studies by sooknundun et al. 28 or rombaut et al. 32
which had high sedation rates. it should be noted that
although  xxxd236xxx  was specifically developed as a
nonsedating antihistamine, a significant percentage of
patients may complain of sedation, and thus its advantage is of lower sedation in comparison with conventional antihistamines.

seven trials have compared  xxxd236xxx  with terfenadine. two of these studies state no significant difference
in incidence of sedation between the two drugs,11.45
whereas the other five studies combined report a sedation incidence of 24 percent for terfenadine and 21.5
percent for  xxxd236xxx . 12.30-33
increased weight usually has been associated with an
increase in appetite. similar effects have also been reported with  xxxd1785xxx , an antihistamine with antiserotonin activity. since  xxxd236xxx  has little effect on
serotonin, except at high doses, it has been suggested that
 xxxd236xxx  exerts a direct effect on the hypothalamic satiety center.10 one method of controlling weight gain is to
alert patients to this possible effect at the onset of therapy or if weight gain is noticed.
there is little published information on drug interactions with  xxxd236xxx . the effects of ethanol plus
 xxxd236xxx  on the cns have been studied using psychomotor tests;  xxxd236xxx  did not potentiate inebriation or
sedation following acute alcohol intake." in another
study  xxxd236xxx  did not alter the cns effects of diazepam iomg. 7
after one month of therapy  xxxd236xxx  did not affect
hepatic microsomal enzymes," and liver blood flow
was unaffected after three months of therapy." therefore, the probability of drug interactions involving the
hepatic microsomal enzyme system is small.

effects in special populations
no teratogenic effects have been seen in rats and rabbits at doses as high as 160 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg, respectively.' however, this drug should be used with caution
in women of childbearing age since it takes a long time
for the drug to be eliminated from the body. the drug is
contraindicated in pregnant women. dosage reduction
in patients with decreased renal function is probably
not needed since the drug is highly metabolized and is
excreted primarily in the feces.' due to high protein
binding, there is no decrease in plasma concentration of
 xxxd236xxx  or its hydroxylated metabolites after dialysis."  xxxd236xxx  is effective and well tolerated in pediatric hayfever patients.v-" there is no information on
 xxxd236xxx  use in geriatric populations or in patients with
liver disease; however, caution should be exercised in
both populations because drug effects may be considerably prolonged.

dosage
the recommended adult dosage of  xxxd236xxx  is 10
mg once daily on an empty stomach. children aged 6
through 12 years should receive half the adult dose.
recommendations have been made that children under
6 years of age receive 0.2 mg/kg/d' but the dosage for
this age group has not been established in the u.s.
one study has suggested that it may be possible to
administer  xxxd236xxx  less frequently than once a day.
based on global assessment, 155 hay fever patients
judged  xxxd236xxx  10 mg/wk and 25 mg/wk to be more
effective than placebo.50 once- or twice-weekly therapy
may be sufficient in many patients, but further studies
drug intelligence and clinical pharmacy

are needed comparing once-daily to once-weekly dosing.
therapeutic issues
the duration of therapeutic effects is prolonged.
chapman and rawlins found a decrease in wheal and
flare response to intradermal histamine 32 days after a
single 40-mg dose of  xxxd236xxx ." krause and schuster
reported that patients still had a depressed wheal response to intradermal histamine four weeks after finishing a four-week 10 mg/d treatment regimen." clinicians
should be aware that skin tests dependent on a histamine
response may be altered for many weeks after the drug is
discontinued.
because of its delayed onset but long duration of
action,  xxxd236xxx  is not the antihistamine of choice for
treatment of acute allergic symptoms. median time to
onset of action for symptomatic relief of hay fever in
patients is two days. 30 a regimen of 10 mg/d resulted in
a five-day lag period before beneficial effects of  xxxd236xxx  were evident in patients with rhinoconjunctivitis."
a loading dose of 30 mg/d for one week followed by 10
mg/d was more effective than 10 mg/d in suppressing
histamine-induced wheal and flare." to rapidly achieve
therapeutic levels a loading-dose regimen of 30 mg/d
for seven days has been used in several clinical trials. 36.37
an alternative to loading doses for treatment of hay
fever is to begin  xxxd236xxx  one to two weeks before the
onset of symptoms is expected. if acute control of symptoms is desired a rapid-acting antihistamine should also
be given for two to five days or until symptoms subside.
availability
 xxxd236xxx  will be manufactured as lo-mg tablets. a
2 mg/ml suspension is available in europe and plans to
market it in the u.s. are under consideration. the cost
of the product is not available at this time (personal
communication, wilson king, jr., janssen pharmaceutica, piscataway, nj, may 1987).
summary
 xxxd236xxx  is a safe and effective histamine i-receptor
antagonist for the treatment of seasonal allergic
rhinitis, perennial allergic rhinitis, chronic urticaria,
and allergic conjunctivitis. its usefulness is limited to
treatment of histamine-mediated symptoms and therefore is not very effective in treating nasal blockage and
central itching. in comparison studies terfenadine and
 xxxd236xxx  appear to be well tolerated and equally effective when the delayed onset of action of  xxxd236xxx  is
taken into account.
because  xxxd236xxx  has a delayed onset of action,
antihistamines with a more rapid onset are preferable
for treatment of acute allergic symptoms. the major
role of  xxxd236xxx  in therapy will be as prophylactic
treatment of outpatients with chronic or recurrent allergic conditions, and it will be a useful addition to the
formulary for institutions that serve a large number of
these outpatients. cost information is not yet available.
if, like terfenadine,  xxxd236xxx  is considerably more
expensive than conventional antihistamines, its use may

extracto
 xxxd236xxx  es un antagonista hi altamente selectivo y de acci6n
prolongada, con minimo efecto central y anticolinergico. estudios
comparativos han demostrado que  xxxd236xxx  es igual 0 superior a los
antihistaminicos,  xxxd293xxx  (inhalador nasal), y cromolin
s6dico, corrientemente utilizados en el alivio de sintomas alergicos
estacionales y rinitis alergica perenne. otros usos incluyen el
tratamiento de la conjuntivitis alergica y urticaria cr6nica. su

empleo en el control de sintomas alergicos agudos no es
recomendable debido a que carece de acci6n inmediata.  xxxd236xxx  y
su metabolito activo, desmetilasternizol, poseen vidas media de
eliminaci6n prolongadas que permiten dosificar una vez al dia. la
incidencia de efecto sedativo con el uso de este agente es menor que
con los antihistaminicos convencionales; sin embargo, incremento
en el apetito y ganancia de peso puede ocurrir.  xxxd236xxx  pudiera ser
de utilidad en el tratamiento profilactico y de mantenimiento de
pacientes con condiciones alergicas cr6nicas que no puedan tolerar
los efectos sedativos 0 anticolinergicos de los antihistaminicos
convencionales.
encarnacion c. suarez
resume
l'asternizole est un antagoniste hautement selectif des recepteurs hi'
ii a une action prolongee et induit peu d'effets secondaires
anticholinergiques et centraux. des etudes comparatives ont
dernontre que i'asternizole a une activite superieure ou equivalente
aux antihistaminiques presenternent disponibles, au vaporisateur
nasal de beclornethasone ainsi qu'au  xxxd1763xxx  sodique pour
sou lager les syrnptomes de la rhinite allergique saisonniere et non
saisonniere. l' xxxd236xxx  est aussi utile pour sou lager la
conjonctivite allergique et i'urticaire chronique. ii n'est cependant
pas utile pour soulager les symptornes associes a des reactions
allergiques aigues car il a un debut d'action lent. l' xxxd236xxx  et son
metabolite actif, ie desmethylastemizole, ont de longues demi-vies
d'elimination qui permettent une administration quotidienne du
produit. l'incidence de somnolence est plus faible avec l'asternizole
qu'avec la therapie antihistaminique conventionnelle, cependant on
observe une augmentation de l'appetit et un gain ponderal.
l'asternizole peut etre utile dans la therapie de maintenance et la
prophylaxie des patients souffrant de conditions allergiques
chroniques et qui ne peuvent toleres les effets anticholinergiques et
sedatifs des antihistaminiques conventionnels.
