abstract: there are few prospective clinical trials of mtor inhibitors
(or proliferation signal inhibitors) combined with cni inhibitors in
de novo pediatric renal transplantation. results reported here are from a
multicenter, open-label study in de novo pediatric renal transplant
patients (£ 16 yr), in which patients received  xxxd2072xxx  with cyclosporine and corticosteroids for one yr, then entered an extension study
for a further two yr. nineteen patients completed the one-yr study, of
whom three discontinued study medication. fifteen of the remaining
16 patients entered the extension study, eight of whom were aged
<10 yr (group 1) and seven were aged 10–16 yr (group 2). mean daily
dose of  xxxd2072xxx  during the ﬁrst 36 months was 1.53 mg/m2 bsa.
biopsy-proven acute rejection occurred in three patients in group 2 and
in one patient in group 1. biopsy-proven chronic allograft rejection was
reported in four patients (two in each age group). graft survival at one
yr was 100%; one patient in group 2 lost their graft subsequently
during the extension. for patients entering the extension, patient survival at three yr was 100%. there were three cases of viral infection,
including one case of cytomegalovirus infection. at three yr, mean total
cholesterol was 5.5 ± 0.8 mm/l (213 ± 31 mg/dl) and four patients
received statin therapy. mean serum creatinine at 36 months was
96 ± 36 lm/l (1.1 ± 0.4 mg/dl). this is the ﬁrst long-term prospective study to demonstrate that a regimen of  xxxd2072xxx , cyclosporine,
and corticosteroids provides good eﬃcacy, tolerability, and safety in
de novo pediatric renal transplant patients.

despite recent improvements in acute rejection
rates following pediatric renal transplantation
over the last decade (1), rejection rates of 30% or
higher are still typical (2–4). moreover, current

immunosuppressive regimens are associated
with toxicities that are particularly unfavorable
for pediatric patients. calcineurin inhibitor
therapy carries a well-recognized risk of nephrotoxicity, new-onset diabetes mellitus, and other
cardiovascular risk factors. chronic steroid
administration has important implications for
normal growth and development, as well as
unpleasant cosmetic eﬀects, while mycophenolic
acid therapy increases gastrointestinal side eﬀects
and leukopenia. in this setting, use of psi (also

 xxxd2072xxx  in pediatric renal transplant recipients

known as mtor inhibitor)  xxxd2072xxx  presents
an alternative therapeutic option.  xxxd2072xxx 
acts synergistically with calcineurin inhibitors (5),
oﬀering the potential to decrease calcineurin
inhibitor exposure. rejection rates of 14–15%
have been reported in adult renal transplant
patients receiving reduced-exposure cyclosporine
in combination with  xxxd2072xxx  at 12 months (6).
there is, however, a scarcity of prospective
clinical studies of psi therapy in de novo pediatric
renal transplant patients. a randomized, doubleblind study of sirolimus (2 or 5 mg) vs. azathioprine in combination with cyclosporine and
prednisolone has been undertaken in 12 adolescent patients (age 13–18 yr) (7), but data in
younger children are lacking. accordingly, a
multicenter, open-label study was initiated to
evaluate the eﬃcacy and safety of  xxxd2072xxx  in
combination with standard dose cyclosporine
and corticosteroids in de novo pediatric renal
transplant patients. a dispersible formulation
(0.1 and 0.25 mg strengths) of  xxxd2072xxx  administered in water was used, avoiding the diﬃculties
associated with use of conventional tablets and
allowing precise dosing according to bsa in
young children (8). the six months results from
this study have been reported previously (9).
there were no graft losses and three reversible
acute rejection episodes. this  xxxd2072xxx /cyclosporine regimen was generally well tolerated. the
three-yr results are reported here and provide the
ﬁrst long-term prospective data on use of  xxxd2072xxx  in pediatric renal transplantation.
patients and methods
patient population
de novo renal transplant patients aged £ 16 yr were
recruited at seven centers in the united states and europe to
a multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial of  xxxd2072xxx  in
combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. all
patients completing this one-yr core trial, who remained on
study medication, were eligible to enter a two-yr extension
study, during which they continued to receive the same
immunosuppressive regimen.
patients entering the study were recipients of a primary
kidney transplant from a deceased donor or a living related
or unrelated donor (human leukocyte antigen non-identical). the main exclusion criteria were a non-functioning
graft at 48 h post-transplant, cold ischemia time >40 h,
panel reactive antibodies >50% at last pretransplant
assessment, multi-organ transplantation, or co-administration of drugs known to be strong inhibitors or inducers of
cytochrome p450-metabolizing enzymes (i.e., cyp 3a).
written informed consent was obtained from the patientsõ
parent or legal guardian, and the study was conducted in
full compliance with eec directive 91/507, the us 21 code
of federal regulations and the amended declaration of
helsinki, following approval from the local ethics committee at each center.

recruitment to the trial was interrupted temporarily following a report in adult male renal transplant patients that
recovery of low testosterone levels after transplantation was
less in  xxxd2072xxx -treated patients than among those
receiving mmf. however, analysis of limited blood samples
from patients already enrolled in the current trial suggested
that testosterone levels in boys were within the normal range
for their ages, as were levels of follicle-stimulating hormone
and lh in both girls and boys, and recruitment was continued, collecting these parameters in all patients.

immunosuppression
 xxxd2072xxx  therapy was initiated within 48 h of transplantation, administered orally twice daily (12 h apart) at
0.8 mg/m2 bsa per dose, using the dispersible formulation
given in water as a drink or via a 10 ml syringe or spoon.
the maximum single dose was not to exceed 1.5 mg,
regardless of bsa. the dose of 0.8 mg/m2 was selected on
the basis of pharmacokinetic data from a single-dose study
in maintenance pediatric renal transplant patients (10).
following a protocol amendment,  xxxd2072xxx  dose was
adjusted to achieve a trough level ‡3 ng/ml so as to minimize risk of rejection when trough cyclosporine levels were
concomitantly reduced to 50–100 ng/ml. this amendment
was implemented after enrollment was complete and all
patients had been on study medication for at least six
months. administration of  xxxd2072xxx  was to take place at
least one h before or after meals, and within 10 min of the
corresponding dose of cyclosporine. the  xxxd2072xxx  dose
was reduced, or interrupted, if platelet count fell to below
75 · 109/l or if the white blood cell count to below 3 · 109/
l or at the discretion of the clinician following a moderate
or severe adverse event.
protocol guidelines speciﬁed a stepwise algorithm for
management of hyperlipidemia to be implemented sequentially in case of lack of response. the sequence was medication review and dietary instructions, introduction of
statin, optimization of statin or implementation of other
lipid lowering therapy, use of ﬁbrates for hypertriglyceridemia and ﬁnally  xxxd2072xxx  dose reduction or interruption.
the algorithm was implemented at the following levels
(from adult treatment panel iii): (i) total cholesterol > 250 mg/dl (6.5 mm/l) and ldl-c > 160 mg/dl
(4.1 mm/l); (ii) ldl-c > 160 mg/dl (4.1 mm/l); and
(iii) triglycerides >600 mg/dl (6.9 mm/l).
cyclosporine microemulsion (neoral, novartis pharma
ag, basel, switzerland) was commenced at a center-speciﬁc
dose of 6–12 mg/kg/day (300–500 mg/m2/day) and adjusted
to maintain standard target trough levels. initially, the
target cyclosporine trough level was 200–350 ng/ml during
month 1 and 100–300 ng/ml thereafter. a protocol
amendment, implemented when enrolment was complete
and all patients had been on study medication for at least six
months, revised the target cyclosporine trough range to 75–
150 ng/ml from month 1 to 2 and then to 50–100 ng/ml
after month 3. glucocorticosteroids were administered as
per local practice with a minimum dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day.
use of anti-interleukin-2 receptor antibody induction therapy was permitted if it formed part of the standard local
immunosuppression protocol. tacrolimus, mmf, and
azathioprine were not permitted. acute rejection was treated initially with intravenous methylprednisolone 10 mg/kg
(250 mg/m2 i.v.) for 3–5 days, and according to local
practice if required. prophylaxis for pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia was given to all patients, and cmv prophylaxis

457

ettenger et al.
was mandatory for cmv-negative patients receiving a
cmv-positive donor organ, administered as per local
practice.

evaluation
eﬃcacy variables included a composite end-point of the
incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection, graft loss, death,
or loss to follow-up. the composite end-point was reached
when the ﬁrst component event occurs so the number of
events in the composite may be fewer than the sum of the
individual events. individual eﬃcacy variables (which are
not mutually exclusive) were also recorded, including the
incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection, clinically conﬁrmed acute rejection, antibody-treated acute rejection,
biopsy-proven chronic allograft rejection, graft loss, or
death. rejection episodes were graded by local pathologists,
according to banﬀ criteria (11).
safety assessments included occurrence and severity of
adverse events, hematologic, biochemical, and urinalysis
measurements, and vital signs including periodic ecg
recordings. egfr was calculated by the schwartz formula
(12).

statistical analyses
all eﬃcacy analyses were based on the itt population, either for the 12-month core study or the extension study. in
the latter case, the itt population comprised those patients
who completed the one-yr core study and entered the
extension. safety analyses for the core and extension studies
were performed on the safety populations, which included
all patients who entered either the core study or the extension, and provided at least one safety assessment. the itt
and safety populations were the same. data were analyzed
overall and by two age groups (<10 and 10–16 yr at time of
transplantation). diﬀerences between the two age groups
were not compared statistically because of diﬀerent baseline
distribution for most variables. continuous variables are
presented as mean ± s.d., categorical variables are presented numerically.

patient population

nineteen patients were recruited, all of whom
completed the 12-month core study. ten patients
were aged <10 yr (group 1) and nine were aged
10–16 yr (group 2). demographics and baseline
characteristics are shown in table 1. three
patients discontinued study medication by month
12, one because of post-operative complications,
one because of unsatisfactory therapeutic eﬀect,
and one withdrew consent. of the 16 patients
who remained on study medication throughout,
15 consented or assented to enter the extension
study. patient characteristics of the extension
study population were similar to those of the core
study population. eight patients in the extension
study were aged <10 yr at time of transplant
(group 1) and seven were aged 10–16 yr (group
2). four patients discontinued study medication
during the extension. in group 1, one patient
458

withdrew consent and two discontinued because
of adverse events (one with elevated blood
creatinine and one with epstein–barr virus
infection, neither of which were considered to
be drug related by the investigator). one patient
in group 2 discontinued as the result of a
protocol violation. this patient became noncompliant with respect to study medication,
discontinuing on day 434 and subsequently
suﬀering a graft loss on day 475.
immunosuppression

the mean daily dose of  xxxd2072xxx  during the
ﬁrst 36 months post-transplant was 1.53 mg/m2
bsa, and remained relatively constant throughout the study (table 2). mean  xxxd2072xxx  dose,
corrected for bsa, was similar between age
groups and the mean exposure remained

relatively constant throughout the study (fig. 1).
cyclosporine dose, adjusted for body weight, was
approximately twice as high in group 1 compared with group 2 (5.9 mg/kg vs. 2.8 mg/kg).
as cyclosporine dosing was adjusted by 12 h
trough levels, this diﬀerence reﬂected the higher
clearance of cyclosporine in younger patients.
similarly, steroid dosing was higher in the
younger age group (table 2). the overall mean
steroid doses at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months were
0.2, 0.2, 0.1, and 0.1 prednisone equivalent
mg/kg, respectively. mean cyclosporine exposure
decreased over time consistent with the implementation of the amendment to treat to a target
level cyclosporine that was reduced over time
(fig. 1). sixteen patients out of 19 entering the
initial study received induction therapy with an
anti-interleukin-2 receptor antibody [receiving

occurred in four patients, three from group 2
and one from group 1 (table 3). there were six
episodes of biopsy-proven acute rejection in ﬁve
patients, one was grade ia, three were grade ib,
and two were grade iia, occurring on days 163,
417, 450, 487, 158, and 418 post-transplant,
respectively. one patient had recurrent rejection,
having a grade iia episode (day 158) followed
by a grade ib episode (day 417). the second
episode was because of non-compliance and led
to graft loss on day 475. the  xxxd2072xxx  level in
the patient with rejection on day 487 was below
target, while the cyclosporine level was within
range. for the two other cases of late rejection
(days 418 and 450) immunosuppressant drug
level, data at the time of rejection were not
available.
no patient required antibody therapy to treat
a rejection episode. biopsy-proven can was
reported in four patients (two in each age group)
on study days 124, 179, 375, and 420. graft
survival at one yr was 100% for all patients in
the 12 month core study. therefore, among
patients entering the extension phase, patient
survival at three yr was 100% and graft survival
was 93%.
the egfr remained relatively stable posttransplant in the whole population with no
statistical diﬀerence between egfr values over
time to 36 months (p = 0.877, anova, table 4).
at 36 months post-transplant, two patients in
group 2 had serum creatinine in the range 130–
164 lm/l (1.47–1.85 mg/dl); all others were
below 130 lm/l (1.47 mg/dl). creatinine values
>200 lm/l (2.26 mg/dl) were not observed at
any point, and no patient in group 1 had serum
creatinine >130 lm/l (1.47 mg/dl) at any point
during the study. during the ﬁrst six months
post-transplant, six patients showed transient
increases in serum creatinine, all but one of

36. changes in levels of total cholesterol, ldlcholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
and triglycerides were comparable between the
two groups of patients. hypercholesterolemia
(total cholesterol >9.1 mm/l or 352 mg/dl) was
reported in four patients and hypertriglyceridemia (>5.6 mm/l or 496 mg/dl) in three patients
(table 6). during the three-yr study, two patients
in each group received statins. hematologic
abnormalities were more common in the younger
age group (table 6), but hematologic changes
were not considered clinically relevant. no other
signiﬁcant alterations in serum biochemistry or
urinalysis were reported.
mean systolic pressure was 118, 121, and

diastolic values were 69, 72, and 70 mmhg.
systolic pressure ‡140 mmhg was reported in
eight patients during the three-yr study (three in
group 1 and ﬁve in group 2), with diastolic

 xxxd2072xxx  in pediatric renal transplant recipients

pressure ‡90 mmhg in 10 patients (six in group 1
and four in group 2). when patient vital signs
data were compared with pediatric bp standards
[based on age, gender, and height percentiles, (14)]
ﬁve out of 11 evaluable patients were hypertensive
based on either the systolic or diastolic blood
pressure readings at month 36 being greater than
the 90th percentile for that bp parameter in the
population. there were no clinically relevant
trends in any ecg parameter in either group.
discussion

the results of this three-yr trial show that a
regimen of  xxxd2072xxx , cyclosporine, and corticosteroids provides good eﬃcacy with good
tolerability and safety in de novo pediatric renal
transplant patients. at three yr, only one graft
had been lost and there were no patient deaths.
all episodes of biopsy-proven acute rejection
were mild or moderate and responded to steroids. only two patients showed clinical evidence
of can and another two patients showed
histologic evidence of can with no clinical
signs. renal function remained relatively stable
to 36 months post-transplant with no statistical
diﬀerence between egfr values being detected.
this is the ﬁrst prospective study to evaluate
clinical outcomes with  xxxd2072xxx  in pediatric
de novo renal transplant patients. other studies
have examined the de novo use of the psi
sirolimus with calcineurin inhibitors both retrospectively and prospectively. a retrospective
analysis of data from 20 patients aged 3–18 yr
who were given sirolimus with tacrolimus, corticosteroids, and  xxxd286xxx , and found that no
rejection occurred during the ﬁrst 13 months
post-transplant, with 100% graft and patient
survival and mean creatinine of 106 lm/l
(1.2 mg/dl, 15). fifteen of these 20 patients
had received a living-donor graft which may have
contributed to this excellent outcome. a small
double-blind study of sirolimus vs. azathioprine
in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids in adolescent patients observed biopsyproven acute rejection in two of the nine patients
receiving sirolimus (22%) (7). a more recent sixmonth study in 66 de novo pediatric renal
transplant recipients who received immunosuppression with  xxxd286xxx  induction, sirolimus,
prednisone, and a calcineurin inhibitor, 64 with
tacrolimus and two with full dose cyclosporine
(16). in this study, the frequency of acute
rejection episodes was low (11%), but 20% of
patients were withdrawn from sirolimus because
of adverse side eﬀects. the reasons for discontinuation included poor wound healing, non-

infectious pneumonitis, and infections with
cmv, epstein–barr virus, and post-transplant
lymphoproliferative disease. here, we demonstrate eﬃcacy with  xxxd2072xxx  that is similar to
that found in these sirolimus studies, without the
high percentage of side eﬀects observed in the
more recent six-month de novo renal study. this
eﬃcacy was found in children of all ages, with at
least equivalent outcomes in the younger cohort.
other safety concerns of psis relate primarily
to lipid disturbances and hematologic changes.
most patients in our population who experienced
early rises in total cholesterol subsequently had a
decrease in levels, and four patients were treated
with statins. younger patients did not appear
more vulnerable to lipid disturbances, but hematologic abnormalities were more common in the
patients aged below 10 yr.
early studies of both  xxxd2072xxx  and sirolimus
found that concomitant administration of fullexposure cyclosporine in adult renal transplant
patients detrimentally aﬀected renal function
(6, 17, 18). subsequently, a comparative trial
showed that  xxxd2072xxx  with reduced-exposure
cyclosporine avoids this increase in renal dysfunction without loss of eﬃcacy (19), a ﬁnding
that has since been conﬁrmed in other trials
(20). in this study, the mean cyclosporine trough
levels in all patients were 155 ± 33 and
60 ± 18 ng/ml at months 12 and 36, respectively. the mean egfr was 86 ± 21 and
83 ± 20 ml/min/1.73 m2 at 12 and 36 months,
respectively; mean serum creatinine was 85 ± 32
and 96 ± 36 lm/l (0.96 + 0.36 and 1.08 +
0.4 mg/dl) at 12 and 36 months, respectively.
neither of these diﬀerences were statistically
signiﬁcant over time. in a registry study (21) of
cyclosporine and tacrolimus, plus mycophenolate
mofetil and steroids, in pediatric renal recipients,
mean egfr in cyclosporine-treated patients at
12 and 24 months was 78.0 ± 36 and 73.2 ±
36 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively. in a study of
cyclosporine with azathioprine and corticosteroids in 93 pediatric renal transplant recipients
with a mean age of 10 yr, mean cyclosporine
trough level was 147 ng/ml, with a mean serum
creatinine of 86 lm/l at six months (22).
another trial of cyclosporine and corticosteroids,
with or without azathioprine, in 32 children with
a median age of 10 yr reported a mean trough
level of 129 ng/ml at six months, and serum
creatinine ranged from 86 to 100 lm/l (0.97 to
1.13 mg/dl) depending on peak cyclosporine
concentration (4). thus, the renal function in
our study patients is in line with that reported in
other studies. over time, in our study, the mean
cyclosporine decreased from months 12 to 36

ettenger et al.

(fig. 1), reﬂecting implementation of the protocol amendment to reduce the cyclosporine target
range to 50–100 ng/ml after month 3. this
amendment, providing for reduction of cyclosporine trough levels and therapeutic drug monitoring for  xxxd2072xxx  trough levels, was
implemented when all patients had been on
study medication for at least six months and
75% of patients were at month 10 or beyond.
thus, all patients were initially on a ﬁxed dose
 xxxd2072xxx  regimen with standard cyclosporine
levels for at least six months, and from
12 months onwards all patients were receiving a
therapeutic drug monitoring-based  xxxd2072xxx 
regimen with reduced cyclosporine levels. in
contrast to the experience of hymes and warshaw (15), our study patients did not exhibit
signs of signiﬁcant over-immunosuppression in
spite of the fact that 13 received an anti- xxxg1173xxx 
receptor antibody. nevertheless, it will be necessary to gain more experience with these agents
and tests that can measure the total state of
global immunosuppression (23).
the pharmacokinetics of immunosuppressive
agents in pediatric patients require careful attention. data from the adult population cannot
necessarily be applied, for example, because of
diﬀerences in drug clearance rates between children and adults. a pharmacokinetic analysis of
six-month data from the core study population in
this trial supports the use of  xxxd2072xxx  dosing
adjusted according to bsa, and showed that
with  xxxd2072xxx  0.8 mg/m2 (maximum of
1.5 mg/m2) twice daily, three-quarters of patients
achieved a steady-state  xxxd2072xxx  trough level
above the 3 ng/ml threshold for optimal eﬃcacy
that has been identiﬁed in adult patients (13).
the remainder of the patients had trough levels
in the range of 2–3 ng/ml. while body-surface
adjusted dosing of  xxxd2072xxx  is appropriate in
pediatric patients, regular therapeutic drug monitoring to ensure trough levels >3 ng/ml is
likely to optimize further the use of  xxxd2072xxx  in
combination with cyclosporine.
in conclusion, this study, while in a limited
study population, indicates that  xxxd2072xxx  in
combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids oﬀers good long-term eﬃcacy in de novo
pediatric renal transplant patients, with excellent
patient and graft survival rates, and is generally
well tolerated.
