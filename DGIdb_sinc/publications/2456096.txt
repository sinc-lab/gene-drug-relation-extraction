key words: prostacyclin;  xxxd2331xxx ; stereoisomer; platelet receptor

 xxxd2331xxx , a stable analog of prostacyclin, has been used for studying the interaction between prostacyclin and
its effector cells such as platelets and vascular cells. the compound is usually prepared as a mixture of
16(s) and 16(r) stereoisomers. in this work, we compared the biological activity and platelet receptor
binding characteristics between the two isomers. the 16(s) isomer was 20-times more potent than the
16(r) in inhibiting collagen-induced platelet aggregation. equilibrium binding of  xxxd2331xxx  isomers to platelet
membrane receptors measured by rapid filtration method revealed that the specific binding data of 16(s)
isomer was fit for a single binding species with k d of 13.4 nm and bmax 665 f m o l / m g protein. by contrasl
the k d and bmax of 16(r) isomer were 288 nm and 425 f m o l / m g , respectively. to further assess different
binding behavior of these two isomers, association rate was measured. the observed association rate of the s
isomer was 0.036 s - l and 0.001 s -1 for the r isomer at 15 nm  xxxd2331xxx  and 2 m g / m l platelet membrane
proteins. we postulate that the striking difference in the association rate with resultant difference in binding
affinity and biologic activity between the two isomers was due to fitting of the molecule to the receptor
channel. the 16(s) form has a more favorable orientation for fitting into the receptor. we conclude that the
two  xxxd2331xxx  isomers must be considered as two entirely different compounds when  xxxd2331xxx  is used as the
ligand for quantifying  xxxg1879xxx  binding.

introduction
prostacyclin (pgi2) is a potent inhibitor of
platelet aggregation [1] and a strong vasodilator
[2]. investigation of its biological activity and
abbreviations: buffer a, 20% acid-citrate-dextrose buffer;

(137 mm  xxxg2020xxx , 2.68 mm kc1, 0.42 mm nah2po4, 1.7 mm
mgc12, 11.9 mm nahco3, 1 g / l glucose), ph was adjusted
by buffer a to 6.8.

clinical efficacy is difficult due to its chemical
instability [3]. the half-fife of prostacyclin is only
a few minutes in an aqueous environment and a
neutral ph [3]. because of its potential value in
therapy, tremendous efforts have been directed
towards the synthesis of stable and biologically
active analogues [4,5]. among the stable analogues,  xxxd2331xxx  has been extensively investigated.
it is a carbacyclin derivative of prostacycfin (fig.
1). it differs from prostacyclin in three structural
features: (1) the ether oxygen between c-6 and
c-9 is replaced by a carbon which contributes to
high chemical stability, (2) an additional methyl
group attached to c-16 and (3) the single bond
between c-18 and c-19 is replaced by a triple

bond. the last two modifications yield a significant increase in the biological potency. for inhibition of platelet aggregation,  xxxd2331xxx  is as potent as
prostacyclin and is 10-times more active than
carbacyclin.  xxxd2331xxx  has become a very useful tool
for quantitation of prostacyclin interaction with
platelet receptors, blood vessel walls and serum
binding protein(s) [6-8]. preparations used in most
studies contain 16(s) and 16(r) stereoisomers. as
these two isomers may exhibit distinct biological
activity and binding characteristics, the purpose of
this paper is to characterize the quantitative difference between these two isomers in inhibiting
platelet aggregation and binding to platelet receptors. our data indicate that the 16(s) isomer is
much more potent than the 16(r) isomer by at
least an order of magnitude.
materials and methods

materials. human  xxxg124xxx , crystalline,
was purchased from sigma. free acid  xxxd2331xxx  was
a generous gift of dr. e. schillinger, schering

laboratories, f.r.g. the  xxxd3449xxx  salt of
 xxxd2331xxx  and [ll-3h] xxxd2331xxx  (14.8 ci/mmol) were
purchased from amersham, chicago, il. collagen
(1 m g / m l in isotonic glucose) was the product of
hormon-chemie co. (munich, f.r.g.).
platelet preparations. platelet-rich plasma was
prepared from venous blood collected in 3.8%
sodium citrate and centrifuged at 200 × g for 10
min at 23 ° c. platelet concentration was adjusted
to 3 - 1 0 s / m l with autologous platelet-poor
plasma. to prepare washed platelets, blood was
collected in 20% acid-citrate-dextrose buffer
(buffer a). platelet-rich plasma obtained by
centrifugation was washed with acd-tyrode's
buffer (buffer b) (ph 6.8), and spun down against
a 5% albumin cushion (1000 × g, 15 min, 23°c).
the washing process was repeated two times in
buffer b using  xxxd3253xxx -hypaque as cushion in the
centrifugation step. washed platelets were counted
and adjusted to 3. 108/ml with buffer b. crude
platelet membrane fractions were prepared from
washed platelets according to tsai and lefkowitz
[9]. the final membrane pellet was resuspended to
a protein concentration around 2 m g / m l as measured by bradford [10] using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as standard.
inhibition of collagen-induced platelet aggregation by  xxxd2331xxx  was performed by turbidometric
method using a chronolog aggregometer [11].

[3h] xxxd2331xxx  or a mixture of  xxxd2331xxx  and
[3h] xxxd2331xxx  (1000:1 molar ratio) was separated
into the r and s isomers by a reverse phase
hplc c18 column (radial-pak cartridge contained in a z module radial compression separation system, waters, ma).
the composition of the mobile phase is given in
table i. these two isomers were eluted at a water
(containing 0.1% acetic acid): acetonitrile ratio of
60:40. the two eluted radioactive peaks were
carefully separated and reinjected into the hplc
to check for any possible cross contamination of
the isomers (fig. 2). each isomer fraction was
pooled and dried under vacuum and redissolved in
50 mm phosphate (ph 7.4). the concentration of
each isomer was determined by its radioactivity.
binding of  xxxd2331xxx  to platelet receptors. binding
experiments were performed by a slightly modified method o f the fast filtration method de-

222

scribed by siegl [12]. for binding equilibrium
measurements, 0.2 ml of platelet membrane suspensions prepared as described above were incu~bated with serial concentrations of [3h] xxxd2331xxx 
for 20 min at 23 ° c. 4 ml of ice-cold incubation
buffer (40 mm tris, 10 mm mgc12, and 5 mm
edta (ph 7.4)) was added to the reaction mixture which was quickly loaded onto a millipore
ap15 glass filter (25 mm diameter) in a millipore
5025 sampling manifold (millipore corporation,
bedford, ma). the mixture was rapidly filtered
under vacuum, and the filters were then rinsed
with 5 ml ice-cold incubation buffer by five consecutive 1 ml washes. after washing, the filters
were dried with a 250 w infrared heat lamp and
placed in plastic scintillation vials with 7 ml
liquescent (national diagnostics, manville, n j).
radioactivity was determined by a beckman
ls6800 scintillation counter with a counting efficiency of 63%. nonspecific binding was obtained
by performing parallel binding experiments in the
presence of 10 /zm nonlabelled  xxxd2331xxx . specific
binding was quantitated by subtracting the nonspecific binding from the total binding. the data
were analyzed by a nonlinear regression analysis
using a model of one class of receptor as well as
by scatchard method (statgraphics, stsc
inc., rockville, md). the time course for the
association kinetics was obtained by quantitation
of the bound radioligand at different time points,
from immediately after the addition of i5 nm
[3h] xxxd2331xxx  to 10 min after the addition of radioligand. nonspecific association of  xxxd2331xxx  was
obtained as described above using membrane preparations preincubated with 10 /zm nonlabeled
 xxxd2331xxx . the nonspecific association of  xxxd2331xxx 
was subtracted from the total binding for each

isomers of  xxxd2331xxx  [13]. based on careful comparison of the data, we were confident that the two
peaks were the 16(r) and 16(s) isomers, respectively. further physicochemical characterization
was deemed unnecessary. the 16(r) and 16(s)
fractions were collected and their biological properties were evaluated. their potency in inhibiting
collagen-induced platelet aggregation was strikingly different (fig. 3). the 16(s) isomer was
much more potent than the 16(r) isomer• the
ic50 of the 16(s) and 16(r) isomers differed by
at least one order of magnitude. the difference in
their biological activity appeared to be more significant than previously reported [13]. in fact, the
potency of the original  xxxd2331xxx  mixture was very
close to that of the 16(s) isomer (fig. 3), suggesting that the difference in the biological activity of
the isomers might be related to different affinities
of these two isomers for the platelet receptor. to
confirm this, we performed equilibrium binding
measurements using the individual isomers and
the mixture as the ligand. we first established our
binding equilibrium method using the racemic
 xxxd2331xxx . a typical binding curve between the
racemic  xxxd2331xxx  and the platelet membrane preparation is shown in fig. 4a. the data of specific
binding were nicely fit for a single-binding species

order of magnitude higher than the 16(s) isomer.
the bm~ (425 fmol/mg) was, on the other hand,
comparable to the bm~x of the 16(s) isomer (fig.
5). the ics0 for the platelet antiaggregation activity, using either pure isomer or the isomer mixture,
was smaller than the corresponding k d values for
receptor binding, suggesting a significant number
of spare receptors.
to further assess the different binding behavior
of these two stereoisomers, we carried out kinetic
binding measurements. the 16(r) and 16(s) isomers exhibited surprisingly different association
rates (fig. 6). association rates were measured at
a membrane protein concentration of 2 m g / m l
and an  xxxd2331xxx  concentration of 15 nm. the
observed association rate of the s isomer and the
original mixture was very close (0.036 vs. 0.024
s- 1 at 23 o c). the association rate of the r isomer
at the same membrane protein and ligand concentrations is as low as 0.001 s -1. the noise
associated with the kinetic binding data of the
16(r) isomer are probably contributed by the
slow nonspecific binding processes to the membrane surface. although the predominant association rate of the  xxxd2331xxx  mixture was close to that
of the (s) isomer, we did observe a second slower
phase of association after the first fast phase was
almost completed (data not shown). when the
data were fitted by a two-exponential model, the
rate obtained for the second slow phase was very

this second phase of association was therefore
attributed to the binding of the 16(r) isomer.
discussion

we demonstrated a significant difference in the
biological activity and binding equilibrium measurements between the 16(s) and 16(r) isomers
of  xxxd2331xxx . the 16(s) isomer exhibits a significantly higher affinity for platelet membrane  xxxg1879xxx  and a more potent anti-aggregatory activity. the binding affinity of the 16(s)
isomer differs from that of the 16(r) isomer by a
factor of about 20. this large difference in the
binding affinity between the r and s isomers
indicates that the biologically efficient species in
the  xxxd2331xxx  mixture is the 16(s) isomer. the
16(r) isomer which constitutes about 60% of the
entire  xxxd2331xxx  molarity behaves as a 'spectator'
due to its weak affinity. thus, the potency of
 xxxd2331xxx  is attributable to the 16(s) isomer which
constitutes only 40% of the molarity. to date all
of the reported binding affinity measurements have
been performed with the mixture of  xxxd2331xxx  isomers, therefore the affinity data have generally
been overestimated by a factor of 2. hence, these

225

two isomers must be considered as two entirely
different compounds when  xxxd2331xxx  is used as the
ligand for quantifying  xxxg1879xxx  binding. this is particularly important when the binding kinetics are determined. otherwise, the data
become difficult to interpret.
when the apparent free ligand concentration is
adjusted for the actual concentration of the 16(s)
isomer (which makes up 40% of the total) then the
binding equilibrium measurements of the 16(s)
 xxxd2331xxx  match those employing the original
 xxxd2331xxx  mixture. moreover, we have observed a
single class of binding by either the 16(s) or the
mixture. these results indicate that the 16(r)
isomer contributes little to the binding nor does it
interfere with the binding activity of the 16(s)
isomer. our binding equilibrium data are similar
to those reported for platelets [6] and ncb-20
cells [6,14] but differ from those for bovine
coronary arteries [15]. the latter tissue exhibits a
heterogeneity of  xxxd2331xxx  receptors. although the
reason for the discrepancy is not entirely clear, it
may be speculated that these two stereoisomers
may exhibit binding affinities that are not as
different in the bovine coronary artery receptors
as for platelet receptors. consequently the use of a
mixture of the two stereoisomers as the ligand

~ ~

may lead to the observed heterogeneity of  xxxd2331xxx 
receptors.
this study provides a model for understanding
the mechanism governing the potency of synthetic
stable prostacyclin analogues. our kinetic data
show that the interaction between the stereoisomers and the platelet receptors is dependent on
the rate of association. this is unconventional
because the decreased binding affinity of 16(r)
isomer results from hindered accessibility of the
ligand toward its receptors rather than a fast
dissociation of the ligand from its receptors. previous studies indicate that the molecular moiety
beyond c-15 of prostacyclin is not important for
the overall receptor interaction [4,5]. on the other
hand, addition to the carbacyclin molecule of a
methyl group at the c-16 position and introduction of a triple bond between c-18 and c-19 is
reported to enhance the biological potency over
the parent molecule [5,13]. our findings indicate
that molecular modifications beyond c-15 have an
important impact on the biological activity as well
as receptor binding. to illustrate this, we have
prepared the spatial models for the r and s
isomers by first acquiring the spatial coordinates
for each atom through a molecular mechanics
calculation program pcmodel (serena soft-

ware, bloomington, in) and then drawing the
spatial model using a transformed coordinate and
an o r t e p graphic software. t h e spatial models
suggest that the p o t e n c y of the stereoisomers m a y
depend on the orientation of the c-16 methyl
group and its relationship to the triple b o n d at
c-18 position (fig. 7). introduction of this triple
b o n d results in a stiff linear segment about 4.5 ,~
extended f r o m c-17 to c-20 tetrahedral protons.
the presence of the methyl group at c-16 and the
hydroxyl group at c-15 seems to limit the flexibility of the methyl end of  xxxd2331xxx  (c-17-c-20).
since the 16(s) isomer exhibits m u c h higher biological activity and binding affinity for prostacyclin receptors than the parent carbacyclin
[16,17] and the 1 6 ( r ) isomer, we postulate that
the 16(s) stereoisomer possesses a m o r e favorable
configuration at the - c h 3 tail region than carbacyclin or the 16(r) form. we would suggest that
the limited flexibility resulting f r o m the ( s ) - m e t h y l
group can facilitate the binding of the entire
 xxxd2331xxx  molecule and permits the close interaction
between the active functional groups of  xxxd2331xxx 
and the binding d o m a i n of the receptor. the
16( r )-methyl group, on the other hand, hinders
the fitting of the  xxxd2331xxx  molecule due to an
a b n o r m a l orientation of the isomer in the receptor. consequently, the association rate is reduced
resulting in a low binding affinity for the receptor.
the geometry of the c - 1 7 - c - 2 0 tail of prostacyclin and its stable analogs is hence an imp o r t a n t determinant for their interaction with their
receptors on platelet membranes.
