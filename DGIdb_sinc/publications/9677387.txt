originally applied to mammalian brain cytosol, leading to the
discovery of numerous mt-associated proteins (maps) (3– 6),
which are structural components of mts and regulate their
assembly. modifications of this general approach also led to the
discovery of brain versions of kinesin (7, 8) and cytoplasmic
dynein (9), the first two mt motor proteins to have been found
outside of cilia and flagella.
to broaden the search for maps, molecular motors and other
factors that may interact with mts, several groups have made
use of cytosol isolated from pure cell populations or non-neural
tissues as potential sources of new mt-binding proteins (10 –
17). in one such case, our laboratory discovered a novel mtbinding protein, 58k, in preparations of rat liver cytosol (1).
curiously, 58k was localized by immunofluorescence to the
golgi apparatus in cultured hepatoma cells and was present on
purified liver golgi membranes as a peripheral membrane protein (1). 58k was also detected by both western blotting2 and
immunofluorescence microscopy (18, 19) in a wide variety of
cultured mammalian cell types. as was found for hepatoma
cells, immunofluorescence labeling of other cell types with anti58k antibodies yielded bright staining of the golgi complex.
although the localization of a map-like protein on golgi
membranes was initially surprising, it was not unprecedented
(20) and offered potential insight into the intriguing relationship between mts and the golgi complex in interphase cells.
the golgi complex in nondividing cells typically comprises an
interconnected network of stacked cisternae (21), which are
located either near the nucleus (22), or in some types of polarized epithelial cells, adjacent to the apical surface (23, 24).
exposure of interphase cells to mt depolymerizing drugs, such
as  xxxd1831xxx  or  xxxd2745xxx , causes the golgi apparatus to break
apart into scores of fragments that are widely distributed
throughout the cytoplasm (25, 26). similar effects on the golgi
apparatus have been observed in cells exposed to taxol (25, 27),
a drug which stimulates mt assembly, and as a by-product,
disrupts the normal organization of mts. it is evident, therefore, that the structural integrity and normal localization of the
golgi apparatus in interphase cells depends upon the presence
and normal organization of mts. at the time that 58k was
initially characterized, the dependence of the golgi on mts was
well known, but poorly understood mechanistically. we therefore decided to investigate the hypothesis that 58k anchors
golgi membranes to mts and helps to maintain the structural
unity of the golgi and its proper positioning within the cell (1).
new evidence derived from biochemical, immunological, molecular biological, and enzymological studies indicates that 58k
is a version of  xxxg817xxx  ( xxxg817xxx ), a
bifunctional enzyme which catalyzes two consecutive steps in
the modification of tetrahydrofolate (thf) to 5,10-methenylthf (28, 29). we thus refer to 58k as rat liver  xxxg817xxx . mts

58k was previously identified as a rat liver protein
that binds microtubules in vitro and is associated with
the cytoplasmic surface of the golgi apparatus in vivo
(bloom, g. s., and brashear, t. a. (1989) j. biol. chem.
264, 16083–16092). we now report that 58k is a  xxxg817xxx  ( xxxg817xxx ), a bifunctional
enzyme that catalyzes two consecutive steps in the modification of tetrahydrofolate to 5,10-methenyl tetrahydrofolate. comparative immunoblotting using several
monoclonal antibodies made against 58k and a polyclonal antibody made against a chicken liver protein
(p60) with similar properties (hennig, d., scales, s. j.,
moreau, a., murley, l. l., de mey, j., and kreis, t. e.
(1998) j. biol. chem. 273, 19602–19611) demonstrated
precise co-purification of protein recognized by all antibodies through multiple fractionation steps, including
gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography, and
sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. eight peptides derived from 58k showed high sequence identity to amino
acid sequences predicted by full length cdna for p60
and porcine liver  xxxg817xxx . furthermore, purified 58k was
associated with formiminotransferase and cyclodeaminase activities. based on these collective results, 58k
was concluded to be a rat liver version of  xxxg817xxx . microtubules assembled from brain tubulin, but not from liver
tubulin, were able to bind rat liver  xxxg817xxx . binding to
brain microtubules is suspected to occur via polyglutamates that are added post-translationally to tubulin in
brain, which was shown to contain very low levels of
 xxxg817xxx , but not to tubulin in liver, which was determined
to be the richest tissue source, by far, of  xxxg817xxx . the
physiological significance of the microtubule binding
activity of  xxxg817xxx  is thus called into question, but an
association of  xxxg817xxx  with the golgi apparatus has now
been established.

 xxxg817xxx  is a golgi protein that binds microtubules
assembled from brain tubulin, but not from liver tubulin, were
able to bind avidly to rat liver  xxxg817xxx , although western blotting of rat tissue extracts revealed that  xxxg817xxx  is far more
abundant in liver than in all other tissues examined, including
brain. considering that  xxxg817xxx  is virtually liver-specific, but
does not bind to liver mts, the ability of  xxxg817xxx  to bind brain
mts is unlikely to be physiologically relevant. although the
hypothesis that 58k ( xxxg817xxx ) links golgi membranes to mts in
vivo must now be regarded with skepticism, an unexpected
association of  xxxg817xxx  with the golgi apparatus has been revealed. it is noteworthy that analogous results were obtained
independently in another laboratory for a chicken liver version
of  xxxg817xxx , and are reported in henning et al. (2).
experimental procedures

assays, which were performed in a manner that allowed quantitation of
enzyme activity, measured the overall 58k-dependent conversion of
thf to 5,10-methenyl-thf. this was accomplished by first incubating
thf with 58k for 3 min at 30°, yielding the primary reaction product,
5-formimino-thf, some of which was converted to 5,10-methenyl-thf
by the cyclodeaminase activity of 58k. the reaction mixture was then
incubated for 55 s at 100 °c to allow thermally driven conversion of the
remaining 5-formimino-thf to 5,10-methenyl-thf (29). thus, although 5,10-methenyl-thf was produced by a combination of cyclodeaminase activity and heating, its yield in each assay was exactly
equal to the yield of 5-formimino-thf, the product of the formiminotransferase assay. cyclodeaminase assays detected direct conversion of
5-formimino-thf to 5,10-methenyl-thf (29), using a substrate concentration well below the km for recombinant porcine  xxxg817xxx . the cyclodeaminase assays were thus reliable for qualitative assessment of
enzyme activity, but not for rigorous quantitation.
binding of 58k ( xxxg817xxx ) in liver cytosol to liver or brain mts—
bovine brain tubulin was purified as described earlier (35), and rat liver
tubulin was generously supplied by dr. tony frankfurter of the university of virginia. both types of tubulin were polymerized into mts by
addition of equimolar taxol, and a 5-min incubation at 37°. for the mt
binding assays, rat liver cytosol (1) was supplemented with rat liver or
bovine brain mts to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml polymerized
tubulin. after a 30-min incubation on ice, the 0.5-ml samples were
centrifuged for 30 min at 40,000 rpm (86,553 3 gmax) at 4 °c in a
beckman optima tlx-120 table top ultracentrifuge using a tla 100.3
rotor. the resulting pellets were resuspended in pem buffer to volume,
and each of the 0.5-ml supernatants and pellets was then supplemented
with 125 ml of 53 sample buffer for sds-page. samples of 3 ml each
were then analyzed by sds-page and western blotting, as described
above. the 58k-2 antibody (1) was used for the immunoblotting step.
chemiluminescent immunoblots were digitally photographed using a
dage-mti ccd-72 camera as an input device for an apple power
macintosh 7600 computer. nih image software was used for image
capturing and for quantitation of background corrected bands.
tissue distribution of 58k ( xxxg817xxx )—several organs (see fig. 4) were
dissected from a freshly sacrificed rat, homogenized in 1 ml of buffer per
g of tissue, and centrifuged at 48,000 rpm (100,000 3 gmax) for 30 min
at 4 °c in a beckman tk120.2 rotor and a beckman optima tlx 120
table top ultracentrifuge. the homogenization buffer was 50 mm trishcl, ph 8.0, 150 mm nacl, 2 mm cacl2, supplemented with protease
inhibitors (1 mg/ml each of leupeptin, chymostatin, and aprotinin).
protein concentrations of the resulting cytosolic extracts were determined by a colorimetric assay (36) using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a
standard. a 50-mg aliquot of each extract was then analyzed by western
blotting as described above, using a mixture of the 58k-2, 58k-4, 58k-7,
and 58k-12 antibodies (1).
results

58k is an  xxxg817xxx —as described in a companion study (2), an
mr 60,000 chicken liver protein (p60) with properties similar to
rat liver 58k was isolated and characterized independently in
another laboratory. p60 binds mts assembled from brain tubulin and is localized on golgi membranes and post-golgi vesicles as a peripheral membrane protein. after learning about
these properties of p60,3 the similarities between it and 58k
prompted us to investigate whether the two were species-specific versions of the same or similar proteins.
several monoclonal antibodies made against purified 58k (1)
and a polyclonal antibody made against p60 (2) were used for
comparative western blotting of various fractionation steps for
the purification of 58k from rat liver. the first step (not shown)
was to supplement rat liver cytosol with mts assembled with
taxol from brain tubulin, centrifuge the mts, and elute nontubulin proteins from the mts by washing them with a high
salt containing buffer (1). the non-tubulin proteins were then
fractionated by gel filtration (superose 6) chromatography, and
peak fractions of 58k were identified by western blotting with
anti-58k monoclonal antibodies. subsequent fractionation
steps, which were also monitored by western blotting using the
monoclonal antibodies, included ion exchange (resource q)

materials—monoclonal antibodies made against rat liver 58k
( xxxg817xxx ) have been previously described (1) and were prepared in our
laboratory as either ascites fluids or hybridoma-conditioned tissue culture media. polyclonal antisera made against chicken (2) and porcine
liver (30)  xxxg817xxx  were generously provided by drs. thomas kreis of the
l’université de genève and robert e. mackenzie of mcgill university,
respectively. affinity-purified antibodies directed against mouse or rabbit igg and labeled with horseradish peroxidase were purchased from
kierkegaard and perry. polyvinylidine difluoride blotting membranes
were aquired from bio-rad. luminol chemiluminescence reagents were
purchased from pierce and used according to the vendor’s instructions.
superose 6 chromatography medium and a resource q column were
purchased from pharmacia lkb biotechnology, inc. buffers, salts, and
other reagents were purchased from sigma. taxol was provided by
nancita r. lomax of the national cancer institute. aquacide ii was
purchased from calbiochem.
purification of 58k ( xxxg817xxx )—our previously described method for
purification of 58k ( xxxg817xxx ) from rat liver (1) was modified by substituting superose 6 for the gel filtration medium that was used earlier,
and in some cases by the addition of two more steps after gel filtration,
which originally was the final purification step. concentrated gel filtration fractions were further fractionated on a 1-ml resource q anion
exchange column using a 30-ml gradient of 0.5–1 m kcl in pem buffer
(0.1 m pipes, ph 6.62, 1 mm egta, 1 mm  xxxd2534xxx ). fractions enriched
for 58k were then concentrated by dialysis versus aquacide ii, layered
on top of a 2-ml gradient of 5–20% sucrose, and centrifuged at 4 °c for
4 h at 55,000 rpm (118,000 3 gmax) in a beckman optima tlx 120 table
top ultracentrifuge using a tls-55 swinging bucket rotor. samples of
50 ml each were collected using a densiflow iic fractionator (searle
diagnostics). analysis of fractions at each step of purification was
accomplished by sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page) using
9% polyacrylamide gels and a tris-glycine buffer system (31), and
chemiluminescent western blotting with monoclonal antibodies to 58k
(1), or polyclonal antibodies to chicken (2) or porcine liver (30)  xxxg817xxx .
eletrophoretic transfer of protein from polyacrylamide gels to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes was performed as described earlier (32)
with the following modifications. the transfer buffer was 12.5 mm
tris-oh at ph 8.2– 8.6, 96 mm glycine, 0.01%  xxxd3215xxx ,
20% methanol (by volume); the gel was preincubated with transfer
buffer for 15 min; and transfer was for 1 h at 100 v.
production, purification, and sequencing of 58k ( xxxg817xxx ) peptides—
approximately 400 pmol of rat liver 58k purified through the gel
filtration step (see above) were subjected to sds-page using a 7.5%
polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and digested with
trypsin (33). resulting peptides were fractionated by two sequential
reverse phase chromatography steps using an applied biosystems
model 130a high performance liquid chromatography and a brownlee
model rp300 2.1 3 100-mm c8 column. the first column run employed
a 0 –50% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and selected peaks were resolved by a second run in which the gradient was
0 –50% acetonitrile in 0.1% ammonium acetate. peak fractions from the
second c8 column run were sequenced using an applied biosystems
model 470a sequencer after being collected on whatman gf/c paper
and subsequent reduction and alkylation of cysteines (34).
enzymatic activities of rat liver 58k ( xxxg817xxx )—the formiminotransferase activity of  xxxg817xxx  is responsible for conversion of thf to
5-formimino-thf, which is then converted by the cyclodeaminase activity of  xxxg817xxx  to 5,10-methenyl-thf (28). for the study described
here, purified rat liver 58k was assayed for both activities by dr. laura
lea murley in the laboratory of dr. robert e. mackenzie at mcgill
university, exactly as described previously (29). formiminotransferase

chromatography followed by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. as shown by western blotting in fig. 1, protein labeled by
the anti-58k-2 monoclonal antibody fractionated identically to
protein recognized by the antibody (no. 569) to p60 throughout
the gel filtration, ion exchange, and sucrose gradient steps.
comparable results were obtained when other monoclonal antibodies to 58k were substituted for 58k-2 (not shown). although not evident on fig. 1, protein recognized by the anti58k antibodies had the same electrophoretic mobility as
protein that was recognized by the antibody to p60.
as part of our overall strategy for characterizing 58k, we
initially intended to clone and sequence cdna for the protein.
accordingly, rat liver cdna libraries were screened with monoclonal antibodies to 58k, as well as with several oligonucleotides whose designs were based on amino acid sequences of
multiple peptide fragments that we generated from purified
58k, and subsequently sequenced. before much progress was
made, p60 was fully sequenced (2)3 and found to include highly
conserved versions of all eight peptides that we had obtained
for 58k, and which together comprised 124 amino acid residues. rat liver 58k and p60 were therefore closely related
proteins, in agreement with the western blotting results shown
in fig. 1.
immediately after discovering the structural similarity of
58k and p60, a search of the dna and protein data bases failed
to reveal any entries with sequences comparable to those of the
58k peptides or full-length p60. eventually, however, a protein
with high identity appeared in on-line data bases. the protein
was porcine liver  xxxg817xxx  (30), and like p60, it was predicted to
comprise 541 amino acid residues. fig. 2 illustrates an amino
acid sequence alignment of the eight sequenced peptides derived from 58k and corresponding regions of p60 and porcine
 xxxg817xxx . seven positions within the 58k peptides yielded strong
signals in the sequencing reactions for two amino acids. the
final position in peptide 1 was either alanine (2 pmol) or lysine
(0.5 pmol), and the first position in peptide 5 was either cysteine (5 pmol) or leucine (4 pmol). the greatest amount of
ambiguity was in peptide 3, in which position 1 was alanine (16
pmol) or leucine (10 pmol), position two was  xxxd2431xxx  (24
pmol) or proline (16 pmol), position four was valine (8 pmol) or
threonine (3 pmol), position five was proline (4 pmol)) or isoleucine (3 pmol), and position 10 was  xxxd2431xxx  (2 pmol) or
serine (0.5 pmol). optimal alignments of the 58k peptides to
chicken p60 and porcine  xxxg817xxx  did not depend upon which

amino acids at any of the ambiguous positions were used. the
58k peptides were distributed throughout a region that began
at amino acid residue 48, and ended at residue 413 of porcine
 xxxg817xxx  and p60, which corresponds to nearly 70% of their full
length sequences. the 124 amino acid residues within the 58k
peptides were 85 and 66% identical to the equivalent residues
in porcine  xxxg817xxx  and p60, respectively (ambiguous positions in
58k peptides were counted as a match if either of the 2 amino
acids were identical to the corresponding residue in porcine
 xxxg817xxx  or p60).
consistent with the molecular data, purified rat liver 58k
was associated with both formiminotransferase and cyclodeaminase activities, which together form the enzymatic
signature of porcine liver  xxxg817xxx  (28, 29). formiminotransferase activity, which was measured by assaying conversion of
thf to 5,10-methenyl-thf (see “experimental procedures”),
was 7 mmol/min/mg of 58k. this value is ;20% of the specific
activity typically observed for porcine liver  xxxg817xxx  (29). 58k was
also found to catalyze conversion of 5-formimino-thf to 5,10methenyl-thf, and thus to be associated with the signature
activity of a cyclodeaminase. because cyclodeaminase assays
were performed using substrate at a concentration well below
the km for recombinant porcine  xxxg817xxx , however, reliable quantitation of the activity was not possible. based on the evidence
presented to this point, we now consider 58k and p60 to be rat
and chicken versions, respectively, of  xxxg817xxx . in light of the fact
that  xxxg817xxx  from two vertebrate species, pig and chicken, has
been cloned and fully sequenced, we have suspended efforts to
complete the cloning and sequencing of rat  xxxg817xxx .
 xxxg817xxx  binds to mts polymerized from brain, but not liver
tubulin—the finding that 58k is equivalent to a previously
described bifunctional enzyme raised doubts about the hypothesis that the protein serves yet a third role in vivo: to anchor
golgi membranes to mts. if that were the case, we expected
that  xxxg817xxx  would bind to liver mts, because liver is the only
tissue from which native  xxxg817xxx  has been purified (1, 2, 28, 29).
all of our previous data regarding the mt binding activity of
rat liver  xxxg817xxx  had made use of mts assembled with taxol from
purified bovine brain tubulin (1). to test the ability of  xxxg817xxx  to
bind liver mts, rat liver cytosol was supplemented with mts
assembled with taxol from either rat liver or bovine brain
tubulin, or as a control, with buffer. after a 30-min incubation
on ice, the samples were centrifuged, and the pellets were then
resuspended to volume. the amounts of  xxxg817xxx  in equal volume
samples of each supernatant and pellet were then determined
by quantitative immunoblotting using the anti-58k-2 monoclonal antibody. as illustrated in fig. 3, 60% of the  xxxg817xxx 
sedimented in the absence of mts, and thus represents background. presumably, the large amount of  xxxg817xxx  that sedimented under these conditions reflected the large size of the
native protein, which is an ;480,000-kda homooctomer (37),
the small volume of the sample that was centrifuged, and the
specific centrifugation protocol, which was optimized for effectively pelleting mts. no increase in pelleted  xxxg817xxx  was observed in the presence of liver mts. indeed, slightly less  xxxg817xxx 
(51%) was found in the liver mt pellet. in the presence of brain
mts, however, 89% of the  xxxg817xxx  was found in the pellet, a
sharp increase over the amount of  xxxg817xxx  found in the control
and liver mt pellets. taken together, these results demonstrate that the affinity of  xxxg817xxx  for liver mts is negligible,
despite the fact that the protein binds readily to brain mts.
 xxxg817xxx  is highly enriched in liver—the surprising discovery
that  xxxg817xxx  does not bind liver mts prompted us to compare the
level of  xxxg817xxx  in liver with its levels in brain and other tissues.
accordingly, 27-mg aliquots of cytosol obtained from each of
several rat tissues were analyzed by western blotting using a

centrifuged, and the pellets were then resuspended to volume. the
amounts of  xxxg817xxx  in equal volume samples of each supernatant and
pellet were then determined by quantitative immunoblotting using the
anti-58k-2 monoclonal antibody. note that the buffer (control) and liver
mt pellets contained comparable levels of  xxxg817xxx  (60 and 51%, respectively), and that substantially more  xxxg817xxx  (89%) pelleted in the presence of brain mts.  xxxg817xxx  therefore binds to brain, but not liver, mts.

as shown in fig. 4,  xxxg817xxx  was readily detected in liver, but
under the conditions of this experiment was undetectable in
the adrenal gland, blood cells, marrow cells, brain, epididymis,
heart, small intestine, kidney, liver, lung, skeletal muscle,
spleen, and testis. although higher protein loads and longer
exposures of chemiluminescent blots enabled faint detection of
 xxxg817xxx  in tissues other than liver (not shown), these results
establish that liver is an especially rich source of  xxxg817xxx .
discussion

based on several criteria, 58k has been shown to be an
 xxxg817xxx . by immunoblotting, antibodies made against chicken
(fig. 1) or porcine (not shown) liver  xxxg817xxx  labeled protein that
co-migrated with 58k in sds-page, and precisely co-fractionated with 58k during its purification from rat liver cytosol. in

fig. 4.  xxxg817xxx  is a liver-specific protein. cytosol was isolated from
rat adrenal gland, blood cells, marrow cells, brain, epididymis, heart,
small intestine, kidney, liver, lung, skeletal muscle, spleen, and testis.
aliquots containing 27 mg of protein each were then analyzed by immunoblotting using a mixture of the 58k-2, 58k-4, 58k-7, and 58k-12
monoclonal antibodies (1), which are now known to be directed against
 xxxg817xxx . note that  xxxg817xxx  was abundant in liver, but was undetectable in
the other samples. at higher protein loads and longer exposures, very
low levels of  xxxg817xxx  were detected in tissues other than liver and in
cultured mammalian cells (not shown). in practical terms, therefore,
 xxxg817xxx  is a liver-specific protein.

addition, several monoclonal anti-58k antibodies reacted with
purified native or recombinant porcine liver  xxxg817xxx  (not shown).
high sequence identity was observed between eight peptide
fragments of 58k, and the full-length sequences of porcine and
chicken liver  xxxg817xxx  (fig. 2). finally, both enzyme activities
known to be associated with porcine liver  xxxg817xxx , formiminotransferase and cyclodeaminase (28, 29), were also associated
with purified 58k. until more is known about the structure of
 xxxg817xxx  genes and flanking regions of genomic dna, it will not
be possible to judge whether the rat, chicken, and porcine
proteins discussed here represent species-specific products of
equivalent, as opposed to closely related, genes. likewise, ambiguities in the amino acid sequence of rat  xxxg817xxx  at several
positions (see fig. 2) raise the possibility that multiple  xxxg817xxx 
isoforms are encoded by multiple genes within a single animal
species. regardless, in light of the new evidence about rat liver
58k, its classification as an  xxxg817xxx  seems amply justified.

fig. 2. alignment of rat 58k peptides to predicted amino acid sequences of chicken p60 and porcine liver  xxxg817xxx . eight tryptic
peptide fragments of 58k were sequenced, and conserved versions of each were found within the full-length sequence of chicken p60 (2).
subsequently, both rat 58k and chicken p60 were found to have high sequence identity with porcine liver  xxxg817xxx  (30). an alignment of the 58k
peptides, and corresponding regions within chicken p60 and porcine  xxxg817xxx  are shown here. note that seven positions within the 58k peptides were
ambiguous, and each yielded strong signals for two amino acids. at each of these positions, the amino acid that produced the strongest signal is
shown within the full peptide sequence, directly below the potential alternative amino acid. the number of picomoles of each amino acid that were

 xxxg817xxx  is a golgi protein that binds microtubules
from cytosol, rather than from membranes (1, 2, 28, 29). one
potential explanation for this apparent anomaly is that both
soluble and membrane-associated pools of  xxxg817xxx  exist, but
 xxxg817xxx  is far more concentrated on membranes than in the
soluble phase of cytoplasm. bearing in mind that immunofluorescence reports relative concentrations of accessible epitopes,
it is possible that the majority of  xxxg817xxx  is soluble, but at a
concentration near or below the level of detectability by immunofluorescence. furthermore, because  xxxg817xxx  is a cytoplasmically oriented peripheral membrane protein that binds membranes by relatively weak ionic interactions (1, 2), it might be
easily solubilized from membrane surfaces by the homogenization and extraction procedures that routinely are used to prepare cytosol as a first step in the purification of  xxxg817xxx . an
analogous situation exists for the mt motor protein, kinesin.
immunofluorescence and other in situ localization methods
indicate that ;30 –90% of the cellular pool of kinesin is associated with membrane surfaces in vivo (41– 44), even though
kinesin is purified from cytosol (8).
while emphasizing that  xxxg817xxx  is unlikely to bind mts in
vivo, the results shown here and in a companion study about
chicken  xxxg817xxx  (2) also raise the question of why  xxxg817xxx  is
associated with the golgi.  xxxg817xxx  catalyzes two consecutive
reactions: transfer of a single carbon from formiminoglutamate
to thf, followed by conversion of the product, 5-formiminothf, to 5,10-methynyl-thf plus ammonia (28). several metabolically relevant purposes are served by these reactions (45).
first, formiminoglutamate is a product of the histidine metabolism pathway, and its modification by  xxxg817xxx  completes the
multistep conversion of histidine to  xxxd2431xxx . next, 5,10methynyl-thf, the end product of  xxxg817xxx  catalysis, can be
converted directly to active coenzymes, such as 5-formyl-thf
and 10-formyl-thf. finally, 5,10-methynyl-thf also lies directly in the pathways for synthesis of several nucleotides and
amino acids, as well as other compounds, including s- xxxd3156xxx  and formylmethionine trna.
the two reactions catalyzed by  xxxg817xxx  have classically been
considered to occur in vivo within the soluble phase of cytoplasm. the finding that  xxxg817xxx  is localized, at least in part, on
the golgi apparatus and post-golgi vesicles (1, 2) raises the
possibility that its site of action is actually on membrane surfaces. liver apparently contains the highest level of folates of
all tissues (46), and acquires its folates from plasma as complexes of  xxxg807xxx  and 5-methyl-thf (46, 47).
 xxxg807xxx  is a soluble, desialylated version of the
membrane-associated, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored
 xxxg807xxx , and like other asialoglycoproteins, is believed to
enter cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis through coated
pits (48). after 5-methyl-thf enters hepatocytes, it transits to
the cytoplasm from the luminal space of membrane-bounded
compartments, presumably late endosomes and lysosomes. because these late endocytotic compartments are often localized
very close to the golgi complex, concentrating  xxxg817xxx  on the
outer surface of the golgi may enhance the rate of productive
collisions between  xxxg817xxx  and 5-methyl-thf. an appealing
feature of this model is that it does not exclude the possibility
that a soluble pool of  xxxg817xxx  is also capable of modifying
5-methyl-thf.

tivity, the measured activity was only ;20% of that reported
for recombinant porcine  xxxg817xxx  (30). the following considerations, individually or collectively, might account for this discrepancy. first, no effort was made to optimize recovery of the
enzyme activities of 58k, which was purified by a method (see
“experimental procedures”) that was radically different than
the procedure used to purify recombinant porcine  xxxg817xxx  (30).
next, isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis resolved purified
58k into eight closely spaced variants that collectively were
recognized by antibodies to rat 58k, chicken p60, and porcine
 xxxg817xxx  (data not shown). the electrophoretic diversity of 58k
could reflect the presence of multiple, distinct translation products, post-tranlsational modifications, or both, although no evidence that might discriminate among these possibilities is
presently available. regardless, by comparison to recombinant
porcine  xxxg817xxx , the purified 58k that was used for enzyme
assays was very diverse in molecular terms, and by extension,
perhaps in enzymatic properties as well. finally, species-specific differences in enzymatic efficiency might explain, at least
in part, the low formiminotransferase activity of rat liver 58k
relative to that of recombinant porcine  xxxg817xxx .
before 58k was shown to be an  xxxg817xxx , studies of the protein
demonstrated that it could bind mts in vitro, was localized by
immunofluorescence to the golgi apparatus of cultured cells,
and was a cytoplasmically oriented, peripheral membrane protein of isolated golgi membranes (1, 18, 19). in light of the
ability of 58k to bind mts and golgi membranes, and the fact
that a properly localized, structurally intact golgi requires
mts to be present and normally organized (25–27), we postulated that 58k anchors golgi membranes to mts (1). new
evidence presented here, however, strongly suggests that 58k,
now realized to be an  xxxg817xxx , does not cross-link golgi membranes to mts in vivo.
the pertinent evidence is that  xxxg817xxx  binds to mts assembled from brain, but not liver tubulin (fig. 3). thus,  xxxg817xxx  is
unlikely to bind mts in the only tissue in which it is abundant,
namely liver (fig. 4). there is one obvious difference between
brain and liver tubulin that might account for the preferential
binding of  xxxg817xxx  to brain mts. located near the c termini of
both a-tubulins and b-tubulins are  xxxd2431xxx  residues to
which  xxxd2431xxx  side chains of variable length can be
added post-translationally in vivo (38, 39). in brain, approximately half of the a-tubulin (39), and a lesser, but substantial,
amount of the b-tubulin (38) are polyglutamylated. in other
tissues, including liver, polyglutamylated tubulin has also been
detected, but at dramatically lower levels and only on b-tubulins (38).
why might  xxxg817xxx  preferentially bind mts assembled from
polyglutamylated, as compared with unmodified tubulin?
 xxxg817xxx  is a homooctomeric enzyme (37), and each molecule
comprises 4 binding sites for the polyglutamate moiety of thf
(40). indeed, affinity chromatography using a polyglutamateaffi-gel column has been used as a final enrichment step for
purification of recombinant porcine liver  xxxg817xxx  (30). we postulate, therefore, that the polyglutamates which are uniquely
abundant on brain tubulin enable mts assembled from brain,
but not liver, tubulin to bind avidly to  xxxg817xxx . the formal proof
of this hypothesis ultimately must rest on mt binding studies
using tubulin whose polyglutamylation state can be altered
experimentally. unfortunately, such experiments are not presently possible, because none of the enzymes responsible for
post-translationally adding glutamates to tubulin or subsequently removing them are reported to have been discovered.
it may seem puzzling that  xxxg817xxx  appears by immunofluorescence microscopy to be localized predominantly on the golgi
and post-golgi vesicles (1, 2, 18, 19), but is routinely purified

 xxxg817xxx  is a golgi protein that binds microtubules
