p.a. shore and r.l. dorris, on a prime role for newly synthesized dopamine in striatal function, european j.
pharmacol. 30 (1975) 315-318.
rats were given either the  xxxg2276xxx  inhibitor, a- xxxd2634xxx  (amt), in doses of 10 or 250 mg/kg
or the neuroleptic, haloperidol (0.25 mg/kg). other rats received both drugs (haloperidol 30 rain after amt). this
dose of haloperidol alone caused only a slight, gradually developing catalepsy, while c~mtalone caused none. the
combination quickly caused a strong catalepsy. striatal dopamine (da) stores were only minimally depleted at the
time of catalepsy potentiation. the marked elevation of striatal homovanillic acid concentration seen after haloperidol administration was greatly inhibited by amt pretreatment. it is concluded that the marked potentiation of
haloperidol-induced catalepsy by amt is related to the absence of newly synthesized da rather than to an exhausted main da pool and that newly synthesized da has a greater role in striatal function than does da of the
main striatal storage pool.

1. introduction
the antipsychotic activity of chlorpromazine or
thioridazine in chronic schizophrenics is markedly
potentiated by the continued administration of the
 xxxg2276xxx  inhibitor, a- xxxd2634xxx 
(amt) (carlsson et al., 1972, 1973). potentiation o f
neuroleptic actions by amt has also been demonstrated in animal experiments. thus it has been reported that th~ suppression of operant behavior by
haloperidol is potentiated by c~mt pretreatment
(ahlenius and engel, 1971), and recently it was
shown (costall and na~clor, 1974) that amt potentiated haloperidol-induced catalepsy. in the clinical
study cited, both amt and the neuroleptic were administered over periods of several weeks, while in the
animal studies, rats were pretreated for 4 hr with the
synthesis inhibitor before receiving the neuroleptic.

dopamine

haloperidol

although dopamine concentrations were not measured in those studies, our own experience with c~mt
(dorris and shore, 1974) has shown that striatal dopamine (da) must have been depleted by more than
half at the time of the observed potentiation. since in
the rat, amt alone has been reported to induce catalepsy several hr after a large dose, at a time of marked
striatal dopamine depletion (papeschi and randrup,
1973), the experiments cited above might suggest
that it was the near exhaustion of the striatal da
pool that led to potentiation of neuroleptic-induced
effects. the present study was undertaken to investigate the interaction of o_h/it with haloperidol at a
time of minimal depletion of striatal dopamine. the
results demonstrate a marked potentiation of haloperidol-induced catalepsy in the rat soon after amt
administration at a time when the large pool of striatal da is almost normal. finally we show that the
marked elevation of striatal homovanillic acid (hva)
produced by haloperidol is largely blocked by the
presence of amt. the results suggest that the major

similarly, all rats after haloperidol + ~mt showed scores of 3

group.
source of da mobilized in response to receptor
blockade is derived from newly synthesized dopamine, the large dopamine pool being relatively nonfunctional.

2. materials and m e t h o d s

2.1. general
female sprague-dawley rats, 2 0 0 - 2 5 0 g were
used. striata were removed as described by glowinski
and iversen (1966), hva was extracted as described
by murphy et al. (1969) and assayed fluorimetrically
by the method of and~n et al. (1963). da was determined by the method described b y neff and costa
(1966).

a test similar to that utilized b y morpurgo (1965)
was employed. the front paws of rats were placed
one at a time upon each o f the two wooden pegs, one
3 cm and the other 9 cm in height. one-half point
was given for each paw that remained on the shorter
peg for 10 sec while a full point was given in the case
of the higher peg. thus a maximum o f three points
was possible for each rat at each time measured.

3. results

3.1. potentiation o f haloperidol-induced catalepsy by
amt
haloperidol (0.25 mg/kg) produced only a marginal degree of catalepsy during the first 90 min after
its administration while amt treatment alone resulted
in no discernible catalepsy during this time (fig. 1).
however, when rats were given b o t h drugs there was
significant catalepsy just 30 min after neuroleptic administration, and the catalepsy score was about maximal after a further 30 min. these results obtained
regardless o f whether a large (250 mg/kg) or a small
(10 mg/kg) dose o f amt or its ester had been given.

3.2. striatal da and hva levels after amt or the
combination of amt and haloperidol
striatal dopamine levels were still almost 80% of
normal 1 hr after c~mt (250 mg/kg), even in rats also
given haloperidol (0.25 mg/kg) for the last 30 min
(table 1). the marked elevation in striatal hva content seen after haloperidol was greatly inhibited by
even a low dose of amt (table 2).

4. discussion
there is now general agreement that a lack of da
at striatal da receptor sites can result in catalepsy in
the experimental animal and that neuroleptics such as
the butyrophenones and phenothiazines produce this
state by blockade of striatal da receptors. consistent
with this view are the findings from other laboratories
that following a large prior reduction in striatal concentration of the amine, the cataleptic action of these
neuroleptics is enhanced (vide supra). as also described above, i t ' c a n be assumed that striatal da
levels in those studies, at the time the neuroleptic was
given, were markedly depleted, and the additional
neuronal firing brought about by haloperidol would
be expected to further reduce the dopamine content.
in the present study we treated animals with amt
only a short time (30 min) before administering haloperidol. under these conditions, striatal da concentrations were almost 80% of normal even after animals had been further exposea to haloperidol for 30

317

min (table 1). it would seem likely that there was
even "less depletion of the main dopamine pool since
javoy and glowinski (1971) have furnished evidence
that in the rat about 20 per cent of the normal striatal da content is in a rapidly turning-over pool separate from the larger stable pool.
in the present studies, even under conditions of
only minimal depletion of the large da pool, there
resulted a marked potentiation ofhaloperidol-induced
catalepsy, indicating that the large stable pool of
striatal da was inadequate as a functional source of
the da needed to overcome receptor blockade by
haloperidol. thus it would appear that the paucity of
catalepsy signs in the rats given haloperidol alone was
due largely to reflexly stimulated da synthesis allowing the release of sufficient newly formed amine to
overcome the action of the neuroleptic at da receptors. it should then follow that much of the elevation
of striatal hva seen after treatment with neuroleptics must arise from metabolism of newly synthesized
da rather than from stored da. the findings depicted in table 2 are consistent with this view. the
marked elevation of striatal hva seen after haloperidol was greatly inhibited by pretreatment of the animals with amt. newly synthesized da thus appears
to have a considerably greater functional importance
than does stored da at least under the circumstances
of compensatory activation of the nigrostriatal pathway.
