postfach 21 73 52, d-67073 ludwigshafen, germany

background:  xxxg1283xxx  plays a major role in the contact
(kallikrein–kinin) cascade producing bradykinin. bradykinin is a vasodilator,
which increases vascular permeability, activates inflammation and produces
pain.  xxxg1283xxx  is also crosslinked to the coagulation system and the
complement cascade. objective:  xxxd1961xxx  ( xxxd1961xxx ) is a potent and specific
inhibitor of  xxxg1283xxx .  xxxd1961xxx  is a recombinantly produced
and engineered small protein based on the first kunitz domain of human
 xxxg2266xxx . it was identified through phage display
technology. methods: the search terms ‘ xxxd1961xxx ’, ‘ xxxd1961xxx ’ and ‘hereditary
angioedema’ were entered into pubmed/medline, clinicaltrials and google.
results/conclusion: at present, the drug is being studied for two major
indications. first, the results for the treatment of hereditary angioedema
are promising. second, a prospective randomised multi-centre trial for the
reduction of blood loss during on-pump cardiothoracic surgery will be
terminated in october 2008.

background

 xxxd1961xxx  is a recombinantly produced 60 amino-acid peptide and engineered
based on the first kunitz domain of human  xxxg2266xxx  that
specifically inhibits  xxxg1283xxx  activity. kallikrein cleaves bradykinin from
high-molecular-mass kininogen. kallikrein and bradykinin are the major
components of the contact cascade [1-3]. the contact cascade is closely linked to
the coagulation and complement cascades (figure 1). kallikrein and the hagemann
factor (factor xiia), the initial factor of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation,
autoactivate one another [1,3]. therefore,  xxxd1961xxx  is now being developed for
two major indications, hereditary angioedema (hae) and the prevention of blood
loss during on-pump cardiothoracic surgery [4]. this review is separated into two
parts, in the first part the effects of  xxxd1961xxx  on hae are discussed and in the
second the effects of  xxxd1961xxx  on coagulation and the prevention of blood loss
are presented.

hereditary angioedema

hae is a rare autosomal dominant disorder based on a
decreased functional activity of the  xxxg281xxx  inhibitor
( xxxd1746xxx ). because of the rarity of hae, incidence numbers
are difficult to obtain. it is assumed that hae affects
between 1/10,000 and 1/50,000 people with no prevalence
in any ethnic group [5,6].
three different types of hae have been described [5,6].
in hae type i (∼ 85% of the patients) the amount of
circulating  xxxd1746xxx  is reduced to 5 – 30% of normal. the
reason for the overproportional reduction with one of the
two genes working is still not completely understood.
increased catabolism, decreased production and/or hindered
intracellular transport of  xxxd1746xxx  have been identified as
likely contributing factors [5,7,8].
in hae type ii, the amount of circulating  xxxd1746xxx  is
normal or increased above normal; however, the protein is
dysfunctional [5,6]. in type ii patients a mutant dysfunctional
 xxxd1746xxx  is secreted normally [5]. because the dysfunctional
1188

protein is unable to form complexes with proteases an
increased level of dysfunctional  xxxd1746xxx  is typical for
type ii patients [5,6].
hae type iii is characterised by normal  xxxd1746xxx 
concentration and function. it represents a unique genetic
disease affecting only women. bork and colleagues suggest
an x-linked dominant mode of inheritance [9]. an enzyme
defect or the production of a yet unknown substance
activating the bradykinin system is suspected to cause
angioedema in these patients [10]. hae type iii may receive
its own nomenclature. x-linked angioedema is proposed
as the nomenclature instead of hae type iii [10]. there are
no detectable abnormalities in  xxxd1746xxx  level or function
even during acute attacks.
the kallikrein–kinin pathway is the likely mediator of the
symptoms of hae [1]. induced by trauma, stress or unknown
etiological factors,  xxxd1746xxx  drops below a critical threshold
and uninhibited  xxxg1283xxx  cleaves high-molecularmass kininogen thus releasing bradykinin. the kinins such
as bradykinin are endogenous vasodilators acting paracrine

and autocrine.  xxxd1746xxx  is the main regulatory protein of
the initial steps of the complement, the contact activation
and the kinin pathways (figure 1). decreased  xxxd1746xxx  or
 xxxd1746xxx  with a decreased function causes an episodic and
uncontrolled release of bradykinin and increased vascular
permeability. clinical symptoms of hae are sudden-onset
attacks of oedema. without treatment, a typical hae attack
is expected to last from 2 to 5 days [5]. attacks involving the
skin (face, limbs, or genitals) are often painless. attacks
involving mucous membranes (gastrointestinal or respiratory)
are often painful and can be life threatening. laryngeal
oedema is the most dangerous manifestation of hae and
may lead to airway obstruction and death. mortality rates
are ≤ 40% [11,12]. bork and colleagues describe previous
dental surgery, general anaesthesia with intubation, age
between 11 and 45 years, history of laryngeal oedema, and
previous facial oedema as risk factors for laryngeal oedema
in hae patients [11].
2.1

available treatment of hereditary angioedema

a recent consensus document [5] proposed to differentiate
therapy for hae in emergency care for acute attacks,
in short-term prophylaxis for specific medical procedures
(e.g., dental surgery, intubation) and in long-term prophylaxis.
at present, in countries where it is available, the first
choice therapeutic option in acute attacks of hae is an
intravenously administered concentrate of  xxxd1746xxx , purified
from human blood [10]. there are no reports of transmission
of hiv, or hepatitis c or g virus by  xxxd1746xxx  concentrate.
however, as with any drug derived from human blood,
transmission of viral diseases has to be monitored [13,14].
despite its long record of use in europe, however,  xxxd1746xxx 
has never been introduced in the us [10]. no specific therapy
for acute attacks of hae exists in the us. fresh frozen
plasma or solvent detergent-treated plasma was recently
proposed by a consensus document as alternatives to the
concentrate of  xxxd1746xxx  [5]. however, the transfusion of plasma
may worsen symptoms during the acute attacks as it contains
significant amounts of high-molecular-mass kininogen [15].
short-term prophylaxis for surgical procedures is indicated
in patients suffering from hae.  xxxd1746xxx  concentrate,
attenuated androgens,  xxxd3410xxx  and fresh frozen plasma
have been used with success for various surgical procedures [5].
no strict guidelines or controlled trials for short-term
prophylaxis exist [5]. in europe,  xxxd1746xxx  concentrate is widely
used for this indication [5], even for patients undergoing
cardiac surgery [16].
long-term prophylaxis should be considered for any
patient who has more than one episode of severe abdominal
pain a year; for any patient who has a history of head, neck,
or laryngeal swelling; for any patient who has frequent
genital or peripheral swelling; and for any patient who needs
> 1/year infusion of  xxxd1746xxx  concentrate [5]. for long-term
prophylaxis, the attenuated androgens  xxxd1806xxx , stanazol and
 xxxd2806xxx  have proven to be effective [5,17]. antifibrinolytic

drugs such as  xxxd3410xxx  and έ- xxxd146xxx  acid are
not as effective as attenuated androgens for long-term
prophylaxis but are recommended as alternative treatment [5]
with minor side effects, especially in women.  xxxd1746xxx 
concentrate is only indicated in exceptional cases as
long-term prophylaxis.
2.2

investigational drugs for hereditary angioedema

three drugs are now under investigation for the treatment
of hae. these are recombinant human  xxxd1746xxx  (pharming
group n.v., leiden, netherlands),  xxxd2317xxx  (jerini ag.,
berlin, germany), a  xxxg258xxx  antagonist, and
 xxxd1961xxx  (dyax corp., cambridge, ma, usa), a plasma
kallikrein inhibitor.
various preparations of  xxxd1746xxx  purified from human
pooled plasma are tested in clinical studies to achieve
approval for the treatment of hae in the us.  xxxd1746xxx  has
been successfully used for the treatment of hae for
> 30 years in europe. therefore, these drugs will not be
discussed in this review.
2.2.1

recombinant human  xxxd1746xxx 

transgenic rabbits produce recombinant human  xxxd1746xxx  in
their milk [18]. recombinant human  xxxd1746xxx  was proven to
be safe and effective in a double-blind, placebo-controlled
phase iii trial [19]. however, the committee for medicinal
products for human use of the european medicines agency
has adopted a negative opinion on approval of the drug
owing to a lack of safety and efficacy data [20]. intravenous
application is required.
2.2.2

 xxxd2317xxx 

 xxxd2317xxx , a synthetic decapeptide, is a potent specific
 xxxg258xxx  antagonist [21]. it has been tested in
more than 1000 people and has been shown to be safe and
effective [21]. the fast-1 (for angioedema subcutaneous
treatment-1) trial in 56 patients compared  xxxd2317xxx  versus
placebo. the primary end point, patient reported median
time to onset of symptom relief, was 2.5 h for  xxxd2317xxx 
and 4.6 h for placebo, and did not differ significantly [22,23].
the fast-2 trial compared  xxxd2317xxx  versus  xxxd3410xxx 
in 74 patients. the primary end point in the fast-2 trial
was reached demonstrating a significant reduction in the
time to onset of symptom relief [22,23]. in april 2008, the
european medicines agency issued a positive opinion on
 xxxd2317xxx  for the treatment of acute attacks of hae. the
fda, however, issued a non-approvable letter for the
application in april 2008 [24].  xxxd2317xxx  is injected
subcutaneously, thus allowing self-application.

( xxxg2266xxx  (laci)-d1),
used phage display for selection, and then produced the
recombinant protein, resulting in the lead compound  xxxd1961xxx 
( xxxd1961xxx ; dyax corp) [4].  xxxd1961xxx  is produced in
pichia pastoris as host [1,2,22]. it is a recombinant peptide
made up of 60 amino acids including 7 unique amino acids
(glu20, ala21, arg36, ala38, his39, pro40, trp42) with a
molecular mass of 7054 da (figure 2) [25].  xxxd1961xxx 
inhibits the proteolytic activity of human  xxxg1283xxx 
with a ki value of 44 pm, which is ∼ 700-fold more
efficient than aprotinin (ki = 3.0 × 104 pm) and irreversible
 xxxd1746xxx  [1]. at the highest tested concentration (10 µm),
1190

 xxxd1961xxx  did not inhibit  xxxg280xxx , c1s, urinary kallikrein or
several other human proteases [1]. it binds human plasma
kallikrein rapidly (kon: 2 × 106/m/s) and is released slowly
(koff: 2 × 10–5/s) [2,26].  xxxd1961xxx  is a less potent inhibitor
of human fibrinolysin (ki = 3 × 10–8 m) and human factor
xia (ki = 1 × 10–8 m) [1,27]. unlike  xxxd1746xxx ,  xxxd1961xxx  is
a reversible inhibitor of human  xxxg1283xxx  [1].
2.2.3.2

pharmacokinetics and phase i studies

following intravenous bolus infusion of 10, 20, 40 or 80 mg
 xxxd1961xxx  into 12 healthy volunteers, mean peak plasma
levels were 2.00, 4.75, 7.68 and 14.80 µg/ml, respectively.

tmax was about 10 min and half-life increased from 33 to
103 min with increasing doses. the clearance of a bolus
infusion of 20, 40 or 80 mg  xxxd1961xxx  was ∼ 4.5 l/h, and
the apparent volume of distribution increased from 5.8 to
11.2 l/h with increasing doses.  xxxd1961xxx  was primarily
excreted unchanged by the kidneys [27-29]. pharmacokinetic
data are presented in detail by williams and baird [27].
intravenous infusion (30 mg) was compared with
subcutaneous injection (10 and 30 mg) of  xxxd1961xxx 
in healthy volunteers (n = 18) in a clinical phase i trial.
the pharmacokinetic results were as expected, subcutaneous
injection reduced maximal plasma concentration (from
3741 to 586 ng/ml) and increased time to maximal
plasma concentration (from 0.17 to 2.7 h) compared
with intravenous administration. ninety-one per cent of
the injected drug was bioavailable when administered
subcutaneously. the duration of time above the theoretical
pharmacologically active concentration of  xxxd1961xxx  was
doubled with subcutaneous injection compared with intravenous
administration. the overall safety profile was favourable for
the subcutaneous route of administration and no significant
site reactions were observed. it was concluded that  xxxd1961xxx 
can be safely and effectively administered subcutaneously,
thus allowing self-administration [1,4,30].
2.2.3.3

hereditary angioedema: phase ii and iii studies

in march 2003, the data from the edema 0 (evaluating
 xxxd1961xxx ’s effects on mitigating angioedema 0) trial were
presented [30]. edema 0 was an open-label phase ii doseescalating trial in nine patients (31 – 67 years) suffering
from non-life-threatening attacks of hae and acquired
angioedema. efficacy, safety, pharmacodynamic data and
pharmacokinetic data were studied. the primary end point
was relief of the symptoms of angioedema within 4 h of
treatment. all nine patients included in the study were
treated with  xxxd1961xxx . each patient received one of three
doses (10, 40 or 80 mg) as a 10 min intravenous infusion.
all patients in all three dose groups were treated successfully
as indicated by a fast relief of the symptoms. relief
was noted within 5 – 120 min and lasted from 2 to 72 h.

no changes in ecg, renal or hepatic function were observed.
one patient suffered from an anaphylactoid reaction, which
rapidly resolved by standard medical therapy (adrenaline,
antihistamine). in this patient, treatment with  xxxd1961xxx 
was continued per protocol and the symptoms of angioedema
were resolved. the data repeatedly were presented [31-33].
the phase ii edema1sm trial was initiated in october
2002 and completed in april 2004. edema1sm was a
multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose,
dose-escalating trial to study efficacy and safety of
 xxxd1961xxx  [2,34,35]. a total of 48 patients (11 – 62 years)
with a confirmed hae diagnosis were included. the primary
symptom locations represented in the study were: peripheral
45%, abdominal 47%, and laryngeal 8% symptoms,
8 patients were treated with placebo and 40 patients were
treated with one of four doses of  xxxd1961xxx  (5, 10, 20, and
40 mg/m2) as a 10 min intravenous infusion. the primary
end point was the percentage of patients experiencing
relief of the symptoms of angioedema within 4 h of
treatment. 72.5% of the patients treated with  xxxd1961xxx 
reported significant improvement of the symptoms of
hae within 4 h after infusion, whereas only 25% of the
patients in the placebo group had relief from the symptoms
(p = 0.0169). the median time to significant improvement
was 75 min for all  xxxd1961xxx  treatment groups, and 303 min
for treated and placebo groups (p = 0.1458). the
safety profile was similar to placebo. no formation of
antibodies to  xxxd1961xxx  was observed in patients of the
edema1sm trial [2].
the edema2® trial, an open-label, repeat-dose phase ii
trial in 77 patients, was initiated in the us in february 2003
and was completed in january 2006. initially, patients were
treated with a 10 min intravenous infusion of 5, 10 or
20 mg/m2  xxxd1961xxx . all the patients were then switched to
a subcutaneous injection of 30 mg flat dose [1,4,30]. from a
development perspective, conversion to subcutaneous
injection formulation of  xxxd1961xxx  would be preferred by
patients and would allow self-administration. the primary
end point was the percentage of patients reporting relief of
the symptoms of angioedema within 4 h of treatment. the
patients could be treated for ≤ 20 attacks by ≤ 2 treatments
per attack. an interim analysis of 63 patients suffering from
180 acute attacks of hae was presented. median time to
response was 30 min, and was not dose-dependent. initial
response rate at the intravenous dose levels was 92% at
5 mg/m2 (n = 24), 86%  xxxd1891xxx  mg/m2 (n = 135), 100% at
20 mg/m2 (n = 15). for 30 mg subcutaneously injected
 xxxd1961xxx  a 100% response rate was reported in six patients.
depending on the dose of  xxxd1961xxx  given, a sustained
response was seen. no patient in the 20 mg/m2 group had
to be treated with a second dose of  xxxd1961xxx , 12% of the
patients in the 10 mg/m2 group required a repeating dose,
and 25% in the 5 mg/m2 group. irrespective of the numbers
or type of attacks, or patient demographics,  xxxd1961xxx  was
well tolerated. thirty patients were treated for up to 12 attacks,

 xxxd1961xxx  ( xxxd1961xxx )

with no decrease in efficacy or safety of the drug. in these
patients no antibodies to  xxxd1961xxx  were detected [1,4,36].
edema3® was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase
iii trial in 72 patients. the trial compared placebo and
30 mg subcutaneously injected  xxxd1961xxx . the primary end
point was patient reported outcome and efficacy at 4 h.
results, number of patients treated and number of attacks
of hae treated have not been published so far [37].
edema4® is a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
randomised phase iii study in over 22 centres and is still
recruiting patients. it compares placebo and 30 mg
subcutaneously injected  xxxd1961xxx ; 96 patients have been
enrolled from april 2007 to march 2008. the primary end
point is the change in symptom severity within 4 h [37].
patients included in the edema4® trial will be followed
up and will be treated for subsequent attacks of hae in an
open-label patient continuation trial. this trial is also still
recruiting patients. patients will be treated with 30 mg
subcutaneously injected  xxxd1961xxx . it is planned that
150 patients are enrolled from april 2007 to march 2009.
the study is designed to provide efficacy and safety data on
repeated use of  xxxd1961xxx  in the treatment of acute attacks
of hae [37].
3.

blood loss in cardiac surgery

in cardiac surgery, the use of  xxxd2988xxx  arrest and
cardiopulmonary bypass (cpb) remains a common requirement as it allows the surgeon to operate in a non-moving,
bloodless field. the use of cpb induces coagulopathy, a
systemic inflammatory response and ischaemia–reperfusion
injury [38,39]. changes in the coagulation cascade result in
the consumption of coagulation factors, which are needed
for the maintenance of haemostasis. the consumption of
coagulation factors leads to bleeding and the transfusion of
allogenic blood [38-40]. the transfusion of red blood cells in
patients having cardiac surgery has been strongly associated
with infection, ischemic postoperative morbidity, length of
hospital stay, increased mortality, and hospital costs [41]. the
transfusion of only 2 units of packed red blood cells (prbc)
increased the odds ratio for infection to 2.36% and ischemic
outcome to 2.30% [41].
3.1 available treatment for the reduction of blood
loss in cardiac surgery

as cpb is recognised to negatively impact coagulation and
ultimately cause bleeding, several approaches have been
made to reduce the trauma of cpb. surgery avoiding
cpb (off-pump coronary artery bypass) is increasingly used
for coronary artery bypass grafting (cabg) surgery [42-44].
off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery seems to be
associated with a reduced risk of allogenic blood
transfusion [42-44]. the equipment of cpb has also been
minimised and the surface of the cpb-bypass circuit
has been modified to reduce trauma to blood and
1192

coagulation [45-47]. these modifications of cpb seem to
reduce the need for the transfusion of prbc [45-47]. these
surgical and technical issues will not be discussed in detail
in this review.

aprotinin

aprotinin is a nonspecific  xxxg745xxx  inhibitor mostly
extracted from bovine lungs [48]. the major targets of
aprotinin within the haemostatic system are  xxxg1283xxx ,
fibrinolysin,  xxxg1847xxx , thrombin protease activated
receptor-1 on platelets and  xxxg748xxx  [39]. in cpb,
aprotinin use acts to reduce inflammatory response to
surgery, to reduce bleeding and to decrease the rate of
re-exploration for bleeding. its use has been associated with
a decreased need for prbc transfusion [49-51]. until now,
aprotinin is found to be the most effective drug in reducing
the risk of requiring prbc transfusion in patients undergoing
major surgery [52]. recently, the marketing of aprotinin was
suspended owing to severe safety considerations [53]. in the
canadian bart study including 3000 patients undergoing
cardiac surgery a trend toward increased mortality in the
aprotinin group was observed [53]. in a previous metaanalysis, aprotinin use in cardiac surgery was associated
with an increased risk for myocardial infarction or heart
failure, renal failure requiring dialysis and stroke or
encephalopathy [54]. the risk of anaphylaxis is increased
in patients re-exposed to aprotinin, so reusing aprotinin
within 6 months is discouraged [55].
3.1.2

lysine analogues

human plasminogen contains one high-affinity lysine
binding site and four or five low-affinity sites. the highaffinity lysine-binding site is involved in the binding of
plasminogen to fibrin and the conversion from plasminogen
to fibrinolysin. saturation of this binding site with lysine
results in formation of fibrinolysin from tissue-type
plasminogen activator and fibrinolysis. this interaction is
reversibly blocked by the synthetic lysine analogues
 xxxd3410xxx  and έ- xxxd146xxx  acid. fibrinolysis is
retarded as fibrinolysin is not generated [56].
3.1.2.1

 xxxd3410xxx 

 xxxd3410xxx  is a synthetic derivate of the amino-acid
lysine that exerts antifibrinolytic effects through the reversible
blockade of lysine binding sites on plasminogen
molecules [56,57].  xxxd3410xxx  is the most potent lysine
analogue with a favourable pharmacological profile [56]. the
relative risk for prbc transfusion in patients undergoing
major surgery with  xxxd3410xxx  was 0.61% (95%
ci 0.54 – 0.69) [52]. meta-analysis of 60 trials showed
 xxxd3410xxx  and aprotinin to reduce significantly the
number of patients requiring allogenic blood transfusions
after cardiac surgery with cpb [57]. in a single-centre data
analysis of 4191 patients undergoing cardiac surgery,
administration of  xxxd3410xxx  decreased the number of

patients transfused or re-explored [58]. however, there is
large variation in the recommended dose [59].

3.1.2.2

έ- xxxd146xxx  acid

έ- xxxd146xxx  acid is also a lysine analogue, 7 – 10 times
less potent than  xxxd3410xxx  [56]. it has a short
elimination half-life of 1 – 2 h and is mainly excreted by the
urine [56]. as the drug is concentrated in the urine, urinary
levels can exceed plasma levels by 50- – 100-fold. a broad
range of renal complications has been ascribed to the use of
έ- xxxd146xxx  acid [60]. the relative risk for prbc
transfusion in patients undergoing major surgery with
έ- xxxd146xxx  acid was 0.75 (95% ci 0.58 – 0.96) [52].
aprotinin and  xxxd3410xxx  decreased blood transfusions
in adult cardiac surgery; although έ- xxxd146xxx  acid was
not statistically associated with any outcome [57,61].
3.1.3

desmopressin

desmopressin, a synthetic derivative of the  xxxd3495xxx 
vasopressin, is the treatment of choice for most patients
with von willebrand disease and mild haemophilia a [62].
desmopressin did not reduce the number of prbc
transfusion in patients undergoing adult cardiac surgery [57].
however, in these patients the drug increased the risk of
myocardial infarction to 4.4% compared to a risk of 1.6%
for placebo [62].
3.2 investigational drugs for the reduction of blood
loss in cardiac surgery
3.2.1  xxxd1961xxx 

 xxxg1283xxx  initiates the first step of the intrinsic
coagulation cascade as it activates factor xii (hagemann factor)
to factor xiia (figure 3). the intrinsic coagulation system is
activated when blood or plasma interacts with negatively
charged surfaces [63]. surface-activated contact-activation
occurs in vivo in the case of tissue destruction. plasma
kallikrein and factor xiia autoactivate one another [1,64].
 xxxd1961xxx  was found to delay contact activated induced
coagulation [65].  xxxd1961xxx  itself is a less potent inhibitor of
human factor xia [1,27]. the inhibitory activity of  xxxd1961xxx 
against factor xia is several orders of magnitude weaker than
its inhibitory activity against  xxxg1283xxx .
3.2.1.1

groups [66]. the level of endogenous kallikrein inhibition
was much lower than the level of kallikrein inhibition
induced by aprotinin [66] and presumably by  xxxd1961xxx .

role of kallikrein inhibition in cardiac surgery

the role of endogenous kallikrein inhibition in perioperative
transfusion in cardiac surgical patients was recently studied [66].
four different groups of patients undergoing cardiac surgery
with cpb were formed according to the preoperative levels
of endogenous kallikrein inhibition. the groups with higher
preoperative endogenous kallikrein inhibition needed
significantly more transfusion of prbc and platelets in the
postoperative period compared with the groups with lower
levels of endogenous kallikrein inhibition [66]. interestingly,
intraoperative and postoperative levels of endogenous
kallikrein inhibition did not differ at all among the four

3.2.1.2

preclinical development

the in vitro effects of  xxxd1961xxx  on coagulation were
evaluated in comparison with aprotinin in blood samples
from 12 healthy individuals [65,67]. reaction time with celiteand kaolin-activation of thromboelastography was prolonged
by both  xxxd1961xxx  (1.1, 2.2 and 8.8 µg/ml) at the two
higher doses and aprotinin (200 and 800 kallikrein inhibitory
units (kiu)/ml) (thromboelastography reaction time with
celite was increased from 5.0 to 8.0, 11.1 min, 15.3, 9.2
and 10.3 min, and with kaolin was increased from 4.7 to
6.1, 8.6 min, 11.9, 6.9 and 9.3 min, following  xxxd1961xxx 
and aprotinin, respectively; p < 0.01). however, both the
compounds did not affect  xxxg748xxx -activation of
thromboelastography.  xxxd1961xxx  induced a dose-dependent
prolongation of kaolin activated clotting time (act; 141,
175, 232, 331 s following 0, 1.1, 2.2 and 8.8 µg/ml
 xxxd1961xxx ). prolongation of act was further augmented
by heparin (1.5 units/ml heparin increased the respective
act values to 282, 416, 713 and > 999 s, whereas
2.5 units/ml heparin increased the respective act values
to 391, 631, 913 and > 999 s).  xxxd1961xxx  and aprotinin
exerted no effects on the whole blood prothrombin time.
 xxxd1961xxx  dose-dependently prolonged activated partial
thromboplastin time values (from 27.3 to 36.4, 44.7 and
60.8 s, respectively). thrombin generation was delayed by
 xxxd1961xxx  when partial thromboplastin time (ptt) reagent
was used as a trigger (from 5.40 to 7.82, 9.78 and 13.5 min);
however, no change was observed when  xxxg748xxx  was
used as trigger. the authors conclude that  xxxd1961xxx  delayed
contact factor-induced coagulation. for evaluation of
coagulation during therapy with  xxxd1961xxx , the use of
whole blood prothrombin time or  xxxg748xxx  activated
thromboelastography seemed to be preferable [65,67].
after intravenous bolus infusion of 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg
of  xxxd1961xxx , the in vitro effects on coagulation were further
studied in blood samples from 12 healthy volunteers. the
activated ptt was prolonged at 1 h in 75% of the eight
test persons receiving 40 or 80 mg  xxxd1961xxx  (activated
ptt ratio ranged from 1.36 to 2.26). activated ptt
normalised within 4 h after infusion.  xxxd1961xxx  had no effect
on prothrombin time, thrombin time, factors v, vii, x or
fibrinogen assays.  xxxd1961xxx  did not inhibit factor xiia. it
inhibited  xxxg1283xxx  both in buffer and plasma.
 xxxd1961xxx  showed weaker fibrinolysin inhibition than
aprotinin, and exerted no effects on clot lysis time, fibrin
plate assay as well as global fibrinolytic tests [28,29,68].
platelet function and whole blood thromboelastography
were studied in blood samples from six healthy volunteers.
final plasma concentrations of  xxxd1961xxx  (5, 10 and 20 µg/ml,
respectively) equivalent to levels detected after in vivo bolus
infusion were used. compared with the control,  xxxd1961xxx

(20 µg/ml) did not affect measurements of closure times
for collagen- xxxd80xxx  cartridges (94.8 ± 9.8
and 98.2 ± 9.2 s) and for collagen-adrenaline cartridges
(136.2 ± 12.3 and 145.3 ± 14.4 s) on the pfa-100 function
analyser. in thromboelastography, mean reaction time (r-time
or time until the first significant levels of detectable clot
formation) increased dose-dependently (from 6.7 ± 0.3 to
11.7 ± 1.1, 12.4 ± 0.9 and 13.1 ± 1.5 min for 0, 5, 10, and
20 µg/ml  xxxd1961xxx , respectively). r-time reflects the fibrin
formation related to plasma clotting factor activity.
coagulation time was also dose-dependently increased (from
2.2 ± 0.3 to 3.0 ± 0.4 min, 3.3 ± 0.4 and 3.7 ± 0.6 min,
respectively). the alpha-angle and the maximum amplitude
in thromboelastography were decreased. these effects on
thromboelastography parameters were more pronounced in
dextran sulphate-activated coagulation than kaolin-induced
coagulation. the authors concluded that  xxxd1961xxx  inhibited
onset and rate of blood coagulation in the activated
thromboelastography, independent of any platelet function [69].
the in vitro effects of  xxxd1961xxx  (0, 5, 10 or 20 mg/ml)
on thromboelastography were studied in blood samples from
17 and 19 patients undergoing cpb. r-time of thromboelastography was dose-dependently increased by the drug
(from 3.28 to 5.57, 6.12, and 6.6 min, respectively). this
effect was more pronounced during postcpb rewarming
(when it increased from 4.56 to 8.7, 10.64 and 11.98 min,
respectively) and in the subgroup of patients treated with
aprotinin (when it increased from 6.19 to 14.21, 16.45 and
20.88 min, respectively). it was concluded that  xxxd1961xxx 
had in vitro anticoagulant effects as it inhibited the intrinsic
pathway of coagulation by inhibiting  xxxg1283xxx  [69].
1194

the prolongation of r-time during cpb may reflect a
reduction of contact factor proteins. cpb was associated
with contact activation, indicated by a decrease in prekallikrein,
factor xii levels, and an increase in factor xiia-like activity [70].
the prolongation of r-time in combination with aprotinin
may have been owing to further kallikrein inhibition by the
two drugs [70,71].
3.2.1.3

clinical development and phase ii studies

a phase i/ii, multi-centre, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation
study in 42 patients at low risk of significant blood loss
undergoing first-time cabg with cpb was completed
in 2003. the primary end points were pharmacokinetic
and safety data. the secondary end point was efficacy
including reduction in blood transfusion requirements.
three centres in the us performed the study. thirty-one
patients were treated with  xxxd1961xxx , whereas 11 patients
received placebo [72].  xxxd1961xxx  was infused intravenously
over the course of the cpb procedure. dose-related
pharmacokinetics were found in all treatment groups and no
serious adverse drug effects occurred. in this small series of
patients, an approximate 50% reduction in allogenic blood
transfusion requirements was shown for all patients treated
with  xxxd1961xxx  compared to the placebo group [72].
a 160-patient, phase ii, placebo-controlled trial of
 xxxd1961xxx  to reduce blood loss during primary cabg or valve
repair/replacement is ongoing (table 1). the trial will be
conducted at more than 20 leading cardiac surgery centres
in the us and canada and will test a low-dose and a high-dose
of  xxxd1961xxx  versus placebo.  xxxd1961xxx  will be infused over
the duration of the surgical procedure. primary end point is

chest tube drainage during the first 12 postoperative hours or
until chest tube removal. secondary end points include cumulative
chest tube drainage at 6, 12, and 24 h postoperatively, safety
and tolerability of  xxxd1961xxx  within 28 – 43 days after
infusion, and pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1961xxx  within 12 h
after infusion. the study started in april 2007 and is
expected to be completed in october 2008 [37].

toxicity

some rats had died after receiving single and multiple doses
of  xxxd1961xxx  and no clear cause of death was established.
the doses applied were > 30-fold higher than the doses used
in the edema2® clinical trial. in primates no deaths
occurred when the same dosages were applied [4].
severe prekallikrein deficiency, also known as  xxxg1283xxx 
deficiency, in humans is benign. prekallikrein deficiency is
not associated with any clinically significant impairment of
inflammatory response, haemostasis, or fibrinolysis [73]. thus,
inhibition of  xxxg1283xxx  is likely to be safe [4].
5.

safety and tolerability

levy and o’donnell stated that  xxxd1961xxx  had been dosed
for 450 times in > 180 patients [1]. meanwhile more patients
will have received an injection of the drug. forty-nine
patients have received multiple doses of  xxxd1961xxx : it has
been injected up to 18 times in one patient [1].  xxxd1961xxx 
was still effective and seems to be safe on repeated application.
in general,  xxxd1961xxx  is well tolerated.
reported side effects are dizziness, fatigue, headache,
nausea, vomiting and elevations of liver function tests [1].
eight patients were reported to have had acute dosing
reactions during or immediately following infusion or
injection of  xxxd1961xxx  [1]. within 60 – 90 min, these dosing
reactions resolved without treatment. in some patients,
antihistamines and/or adrenaline were injected to improve
the symptoms. an anaphylactoid reaction was seen in one
patient of the edema 0 trial [4]. it rapidly resolved by
standard medical therapy (adrenaline, antihistamine). four
patients of the edema1sm study experienced acute
dosing reactions [2]. a mild–moderate, short-lasting hypersensitivity response was observed in one patient from the
edema2® study [4].
antibody formation to protein therapeutics is a common
feature. therefore, patients treated with  xxxd1961xxx  are
monitored for the development of antibodies. in edema1sm
and edema2® studies no formation of antibodies was seen
even in patients who have been treated repeatedly with
 xxxd1961xxx  for up to 12 attacks of hae [2,4]. two of the
eight patients having acute dose reactions were tested positive
for non-ige antibodies [1]. one of these patients also had
ige antibodies against p. pastoris [1]. it is still controversial
whether these dosing reactions have been antibody-mediated.
in a young female patient treated for the first time with

 xxxd1961xxx  an anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reaction was
observed. this patient was tested positive for ige, igg, igm,
and iga antibodies against  xxxd1961xxx  by immunoblotting [74].
however, in an elisa-based assay no ige or non-ige
antibodies against  xxxd1961xxx  or p. pastoris were found
in this specific patient [75,76]. according to levy and
o’donnell, 11 patients have been tested positive for
antibodies, 7 for antibodies against p. pastoris, 3 for antibodies
against  xxxd1961xxx  and 1 patient for both [1].  xxxd1961xxx  was
still effective for the treatment of acute attacks of hae in
these patients. these antibodies do not seem to have
neutralising effects [1]. meanwhile, dyax significantly
reduced the concentration of p. pastoris host cell proteins in
the preparation of  xxxd1961xxx .
 xxxd1961xxx  dose-dependently prolonged activated ptt
values [65,67]. the prolongation of ptt represents a
pharmacological effect and no side effect of the drug.
5.1 chronic kallikrein inhibition and the
renin–angiotensin system

the kallikrein–kinin and renin–angiotensin systems are
closely linked by the  xxxg36xxx  (ace) [77].
ace catalyses the degradation of  xxxg99xxx  into
 xxxg99xxx  and the degradation of bradykinin into kinin
metabolites [78]. kinins are endogenous vasodilators acting
paracrine and autocrine. modulated by the bradykinin
type-2 receptor, kinins mediate the synthesis and release of
prostaglandins and  xxxd2738xxx  from the endothelium [79].
the kallikrein–kinin system is attributed to maintain normal
blood pressure and to exert protective effects in cardiovascular
disease [77,80]. there were contradictory results, whether
chronic inhibition of the kallikrein–kinin system by blocking
the bradykinin type-2 receptor with  xxxd2317xxx  in rodents
resulted in arterial hypertension or not [78,80,81]. in patients
repeatedly treated with  xxxd1961xxx  no formation of arterial
hypertension has been reported. nevertheless, patients
chronically treated with  xxxd1961xxx  should be closely
monitored for the development of arterial hypertension.
6.

conclusion

 xxxd1961xxx  is a recombinantly produced protein derived
from the first kunitz domain of the human  xxxg748xxx 
pathway inhibitor. it is one of a series of small-protein
 xxxg1283xxx  inhibitors identified through phage display
technology by dyax.  xxxd1961xxx  is the most potent and
most specific inhibitor of kallikrein, blocking the activity of
kallikrein and subsequently the generation of bradykinin. it
may exert positive effects in pathologies induced by kallikrein
and bradykinin.
the drug has a great potential for the treatment of
acute attacks in hae. the results so far published seem to
be promising.
after the withdrawal of aprotinin, there is a need for a
safe and effective therapy for the reduction of blood loss in

expert opin. biol. ther. (2008) 8(8)

 xxxd1961xxx  ( xxxd1961xxx )

patients undergoing cardiac surgery. a prospective randomised
study will answer the question whether  xxxd1961xxx  has a
potential for this indication or not. this study is expected to
be completed in october 2008.

expert opinion

 xxxd1961xxx  is the most specific inhibitor of  xxxg1283xxx 
thus blocking the catalytic production of kinins. it is a
recombinantly produced polypeptide in p. pastoris. the drug
was identified by phage display technique. in pathological
conditions mediated by  xxxg1283xxx ,  xxxd1961xxx  has the
potential of therapeutic utility.
hae is a rare but a serious disease with significant
effects to the quality of life of the affected patients. besides
reducing quality of life, hae vitally endangers the patients
from asphyxia owing to laryngeal oedema.  xxxd1961xxx  is
developed for the treatment of acute attacks of hae.
the data presented so far are very promising. it seems
to be safe, effective, fast acting, and can easily be
administered subcutaneously. subcutaneous injection facilitates
self-administration. formation of antibodies seems to be no
major problem in most patients, even those requiring or
exposed to repeated doses of  xxxd1961xxx . however, antibody
formation to protein therapeutics is a common feature. the
problem of antibody formation might be underestimated
with only ∼ 100 patients treated with  xxxd1961xxx  until today.
in the us, no effective treatment for acute attacks of
hae is approved. in europe, acute attacks of hae are
effectively treated by a concentrate of human  xxxd1746xxx 
bearing a potential risk of transmitting infectious diseases.
 xxxd1746xxx  requires intravenous infusion. dyax expects the
drug to be approved in the us at the end of 2008, followed
by approval in the eu. after being launched, peak sales of
us $250 million are predicted for  xxxd1961xxx  for the
treatment of acute attacks of hae [4].  xxxd1961xxx  will be in
competition with  xxxd2317xxx , a bradykinin receptor antagonist,
for the treatment of acute attacks of hae. the therapeutic

1196

approach of inhibiting the catalytic production of
kinins may be theoretically preferable to antagonism of
kinin receptors, because in the absence of kallikrein
inhibition, receptor antagonists must compete with
continuous kinin generation.
 xxxd1961xxx  is also being developed for the reduction of
blood loss and transfusion requirements in patients
undergoing cardiac surgery with cpb. cpb may lead to
systemic inflammatory response syndrome, activates
coagulation and causes vascular leakage.  xxxd1961xxx  inhibits
kallikrein, a key enzyme in the inflammatory cascade of
systemic inflammatory response syndrome. the drug may
have beneficial effects in these patients reducing the need for
allogenic blood transfusion, having potential neuroprotective
effects [82,83] and preventing vascular leakage [84]. in a small
series of patients,  xxxd1961xxx  was shown to effectively reduce
blood transfusion requirements. neuroprotective effects and
the prevention of vascular leakage are yet not proven in
humans. aprotinin, the only drug former approved for the
reduction of blood loss in patients undergoing cpb, was
withdrawn from the market in 2007. in the first nine
months of 2007, sales of aprotinin reached 93 millions [85].
anaesthesiologists and cardiac surgeons are waiting for an
effective and safe drug to reduce transfusion of homologous
blood products in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. in
germany about 100,000 patients undergo cardiac surgery a
year [86] and in the us more than 500,000 patients need
cardiac surgery a year [4].
 xxxd1961xxx  may also be of interest for the potential
treatment of inflammatory conditions and pain. however,
no further research activities on this topic have been
published so far.
