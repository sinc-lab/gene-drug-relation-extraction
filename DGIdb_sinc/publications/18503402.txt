 xxxg682xxx  monoclonal antibodies
for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer
gary w. jean, pharm.d., and sachin r. shah, pharm.d.
treatment of metastatic colorectal disease has evolved over the last decade.
two  xxxg682xxx  (egfr) monoclonal antibodies—
cetuximab and  xxxd2838xxx —have been developed in an effort to provide
yet another therapeutic option. the egfr is a transmembrane glycoprotein,
expressed constitutively throughout the body and found on many epithelial
tissues. the monoclonal antibodies bind to and inhibit the activation of the
receptor in the body. this inhibition prevents tumor cell growth,
angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis, and induces apoptosis. cetuximab
and  xxxd2838xxx  exhibit nonlinear pharmacokinetics. both monoclonal
antibodies are approved for the treatment of refractory metastatic colorectal
cancer. cetuximab in combination with irinotecan has significantly better
response rates and progression-free survival compared with those of
cetuximab or irinotecan alone. cetuximab and  xxxd2838xxx  as
monotherapy have shown significantly better response rates and progressionfree survival compared with best supportive care in patients refractory to
irinotecan and oxaliplatin. in the cetuximab combined with irinotecan in
first line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (crystal) trial,
treatment-naïve patients received cetuximab in combination with the
chemotherapy regimen infusional  xxxd2462xxx , fluorouracil, and irinotecan
( xxxd467xxx ) or  xxxd467xxx  alone; the difference in progression-free survival was
statistically significant but suggested only a modest benefit over  xxxd467xxx 
alone (8.9 vs 8 mo, p=0.036). results of a preplanned analysis of the first 231
events in the  xxxd2838xxx  advanced colorectal cancer evaluation (pacce)
trial favored the control group (chemotherapy regimen with  xxxd2147xxx 
[ xxxd2462xxx ], fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin [folfox] plus bevacizumab)
instead of the control group plus  xxxd2838xxx . for clinical consideration,
many trials have shown that the intensity or absence of egfr expression is
not a clinically significant predictor of outcomes. development and intensity
of a rash are suggested to be a positive predictor of outcomes in patients. the
most common adverse events of egfr monoclonal antibody therapy are rash,
diarrhea, and hypomagnesemia. other serious but not common adverse
events include hypersensitivity reactions and pulmonary toxicity. the
availability of egfr monoclonal antibodies has provided another weapon in
the arsenal to treat refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. they have shown
safety and efficacy in combination with other chemotherapy regimens and as
monotherapy; however, their use as metastatic colorectal cancer therapy needs
to be further explored.

conclusion

colorectal cancer is the third most common
cancer among men and women in the united
states and has the third highest mortality rate.1
in 2007, 153,760 new diagnoses of colorectal
cancer were expected to be reported in the
united states.1 twenty percent of these patients
will have metastatic disease at the time of
diagnosis. also, 14.9% of patients with stage ii
or iii colon cancer will relapse or have metastatic
disease at 3 years after adjuvant chemotherapy.2
more than 52,180 patients were expected to die
from colorectal cancer in 2007.1 the mortality
rate has been decreasing steadily, at an average of
1.83% over the past 20 years.3 agents such as
irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab have
significantly improved progression-free survival
and overall survival in patients with metastatic
colorectal cancer over the last decade.4–6 progression-free survival is an important end point, as it
shows how long these agents keep the cancer
under remission. even after significant improvement in care, most patients will eventually
relapse. therefore, a need exists for newer agents
that have novel mechanisms of action.
the  xxxg682xxx  (egfr)
is a transmembrane cell surface receptor that is
expressed on a variety of tissues including the
lungs, skin, hair follicles, and gastrointestinal
tract. it is a receptor  xxxg2198xxx  that has
activity in the signaling pathway promoting cell
growth, differentiation, proliferation, and

inhibition of apoptosis. the egfr is stimulated
by transforming growth factor (tgf)-a and
 xxxg681xxx  (egf). approximately
25–77% of tumor cells associated with colorectal
cancer overexpress egfr.7, 8 overexpression of
egfr results in angiogenesis, invasion, and
metastasis. 9 two monoclonal antibodies are
available for the treatment of colorectal cancer
that inhibit egfr, and both cetuximab and
 xxxd2838xxx  have been approved for the
treatment of refractory metastatic colorectal
cancer.
to gain a better understanding of egfr monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of metastatic
colorectal cancer, a literature search using the
pubmed-medline database (january 1966–may
2007) and american society of clinical oncology
(asco), asco–gastrointestinal cancer
symposium, and american association for
cancer research abstracts (2003–2007) was
performed to identify relevant articles. the
search included the terms cetuximab,  xxxd2838xxx , and colorectal. in addition, references
from articles were screened for other relevant
literature. a press release issued in march 2007
for a  xxxd2838xxx  trial was also reviewed.
pharmacology
the egfr is expressed constitutively throughout the body and found on many epithelial
tissues. the egfr is a 170-kd transmembrane
glycoprotein. it has egf- and tgf-a–dependent
intracellular  xxxg2198xxx  activity. it has three
major regions consisting of extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains. the egf
and tgf-a binding induces homodimer-ization
of the egfr or heterodimerization of efgr
family members (egfr1–egfr4). this receptor
dimerization results in the phos-phorylation of
tyrosine kinases associated with this receptor.10
 xxxg681xxx  is important for the
progression of cancer, using mechanisms such as
the proliferation of tumor cells, inhibition of
apoptosis, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis.9
both monoclonal antibodies, cetuximab and
 xxxd2838xxx , bind to the extracellular domain
of egfr and compete with ligand binding to the
receptor. they have a high affinity for the egfr,
which prevents the binding of the endogenous
egf and tgf-a to the receptor.9, 11 for example,
cetuximab has a 2-log higher affinity for the
egfr when compared with egf and tgf-a.12
binding of the egfr monoclonal antibodies
ultimately results in the inhibition of cell growth

(in g1 phase), angiogenesis, tumor cell invasion,
and metastasis. it also induces apoptosis and
downregulation of the egfr.9, 13, 14 the egfr
monoclonal antibodies all have been shown to
augment the antitumor effects of chemotherapy
and radiation therapy. in the human tumor cell
xenograph model, egfr monoclonal antibodies
markedly augmented the antitumor effects of
cisplatin, doxorubicin, paclitaxel,  xxxd3401xxx , and
irinotecan.15–18 cetuximab in combination with
irinotecan has shown enhanced growth inhibition
in tumors insensitive to irinotecan or cetuximab
alone.17 the mechanisms that appear to contribute to the enhanced cytotoxicity of cetuximab
in chemotherapy or radiation therapy are
programmed cell death, reduced angiogenesis,
and tumor cell invasion. cetuximab is suggested
to enhance programmed cell death by inhibiting
the cell survival pathway and dna repair
mechanism.17
cetuximab is a recombinant, human-mouse
chimeric immunoglobulin-g1 monoclonal
antibody that binds specifically to the egfr–
human epidermal growth receptor-1 on both
normal and tumor cells.14 cetuximab is 65–95%
human antibodies consisting of a murine
antigen–binding variable region fused with
human constant domains.19  xxxd2838xxx  is the
first fully human monoclonal antibody for the
inhibition of egfr. it is a recombinant human
immunoglobulin-g2 k monoclonal antibody that
binds egfr.13
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
the egfr monoclonal antibodies are administered intravenously. cetuximab’s maximum
concentration (c max ) after a loading dose
infusion of 400 mg/m2 over 2 hours is a mean of
184 µg/ml (range 92–327 µg/ml). a 1-hour
infusion of the maintenance dose of 250 mg/m2
produces a mean c max of 140 µg/ml (range
120–170 µg/ml). in a phase i trial, the area
under the plasma concentration–time curve
(auc) was recorded at levels of 12,520–17,337
µg•hour/ml between weeks 1 and 4, when
patients received the recommended dosage.9 the
auc of cetuximab increased in a greater than
dose-proportional manner when the dose
increased from 20 to 400 mg/m2. with use of the
recommended dosage regimen, patients usually
reach steady state by the third weekly infusion,
resulting in mean peak and trough concentrations
across two studies that ranged from 168–235
µg/ml and 41–85 µg/ml, respectively. 9, 14 the

same two phase i trials revealed that cetuximab
has a mean volume of distribution that is
approximately equivalent to plasma volume at
intravenous doses of 20–100 mg/m2 (45.2–61.9
ml/kg).9, 14
similar to cetuximab,  xxxd2838xxx  exhibited
nonlinear pharmacokinetics when it was evaluated
alone in clinical trials. the auc was found to
increase in a greater than dose-proportional
manner; however, at doses greater than 2 mg/kg,
the auc increased in an approximately proportional manner. 11, 13 according to the package
insert, the mean cmax after the recommended
dosage of 6 mg/kg once every 2 weeks is 213 ± 59
µg/ml, and the mean ± sd auc after the same
dosage is 1306 ± 374 µg•day/ml. also determined
was that after the recommended dosage and
interval, steady-state concentrations were
attained by the third infusion.13
the egfr is expressed on tumor cells as well
as normal cells, which include the liver and skin.
cetuximab and  xxxd2838xxx  have been
hypothesized to be removed through internalization of the drug-receptor complex.9 overall,
clearance of both drugs decreases with increasing
doses, suggesting saturation of the metabolic
pathway.18 in a phase i study of cetuximab, a
small difference in clearance was observed with
200- and 400-mg/m2 doses.18 the clearance of
the drug decreased from 0.08 to 0.02 l/hour/m2
as the dose increased from 20 to 200 mg/m2, and
it appeared to plateau with greater than 200mg/m2 doses.14 similarly, during pharmacokinetic
evaluation of  xxxd2838xxx , the clearance was
found to decrease from 30.6 to 4.6 ml/day/kg as
the dose increased from 0.75 to 9 mg/kg. 13
during clinical trials, it was revealed that female
patients have a 25% lower intrinsic clearance of
cetuximab; however, this difference does not
warrant a modification in the dose. 14 the
elimination half-life of cetuximab after a 2-hour
infusion of 400 mg/m 2 was a mean of 4 days
(range 1.7–9.8 days).14 the elimination half-life
of  xxxd2838xxx  is approximately 7.5 days
(range 3.6–10.9 days; table 1).20 the differences
in the half-lives of these two monoclonal
antibodies may be responsible for once-weekly
dosing of cetuximab versus every-other-week
dosing of  xxxd2838xxx . however, a couple of
studies suggest that cetuximab 500 mg/m2 alone
or in combination with irinotecan could be given
every 2 weeks in the future.21, 22 the need for
dosage modification was evaluated in a variety of
conditions including race-ethnicity, sex, and mild
renal and hepatic impairment, and no need for

any modification was found.13
one group evaluated the addition of cetuximab
to irinotecan and the effects on the active
metabolite 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (sn38).23 in this phase i trial that included eight
patients, the addition of cetuximab had no
clinically relevant effect on the concentration and
pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and its potent
metabolite, sn-38. in another study,  xxxd2838xxx  was administered with an irinotecanbased regimen. 24 in this phase ii trial, no
pharmacokinetic interaction or alteration in
irinotecan concentration was seen when
 xxxd2838xxx  was administered in combination
with the chemotherapy regimen irinotecan,
fluorouracil, and  xxxd2462xxx  (ifl) or infusional
 xxxd2462xxx , fluorouracil, and irinotecan
( xxxd467xxx ).24
clinical trials
previously treated patients
irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab in
combination with long-time standard of care
fluorouracil and  xxxd2462xxx  have shown
significant improvement in the survival rate as
first- or second-line therapy in patients with
metastatic colorectal cancer compared with
fluorouracil alone.4–6 however, most patients will
develop resistance to these therapies. the egfr
monoclonal antibodies have been investigated as
another active treatment option in these
previously treated patients with metastatic
colorectal cancer. the efficacy of cetuximab has
been investigated in many phase ii and phase iii
trials.
in the pivotal phase iii bowel oncology with
cetuximab antibody (bond) trial, cetuximab
plus irinotecan was evaluated in patients with
irinotecan-refractory metastatic colorectal

745

cancer. 25 it was a randomized, open-label,
multicenter trial conducted in 56 centers in 11
european countries. patients were considered
eligible if they had received at least 6 weeks of
irinotecan and had documented progression of
disease during receipt of this regimen. patients
were also required to have immunohistochemical
evidence of egfr protein expression either in
the primary tumor or in a metastatic lesion. the
trial randomly assigned 329 patients to receive
cetuximab plus irinotecan (218 patients) or
cetuximab alone (111 patients). cetuximab was
administered at an initial loading dose of 400
mg/m 2 followed by weekly infusions of 250
mg/m2. in the combination group, irinotecan
was given at the same dosage as the patient’s
previous therapy. patients were continued on the
treatment until disease progression or severe
adverse event. the primary objective of the
study was to compare tumor response based on
an intent-to-treat analysis.
most patients in the trial were male, and the
median age was 59 years. approximately 88% of
the patients had karnofsky performance status
score of 80 or higher. in addition, 63% of the
patients had previously received oxaliplatin
therapy. results revealed that the combination
therapy was superior to the monotherapy, with a
response rate of 22.9% (95% confidence interval
[ci] 17.5–29.1%] versus 10.8% (95% ci
5.7–18.1%, p=0.007). the stable disease rates
were 33% and 22%, respectively. the median
time to progression was significantly longer in
the combination group, at 4.1 months compared
with 1.5 months in the monotherapy group. the
study revealed a non–statistically significant
median overall survival of 8.6 months in the
combination group versus 6.9 months in the
monotherapy group. fifty-six (50%) of the
patients in the monotherapy group received
additional irinotecan after disease progression.
approximately 39% of those patients had partial
response or stable disease after receiving the
additional irinotecan, which could be responsible
for the absence of a significant difference in the
overall survival rate.
a cetuximab and irinotecan combination was
also evaluated against irinotecan alone in patients
with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer, in
the erbitux plus irinotecan in colorectal cancer
(epic) trial.26 this phase iii trial included 1298
patients and reported a significantly better
response rate (16% vs 4%, p<0.0001) and
progression-free survival (4 vs 2.6 mo, p<0.0001)
when the cetuximab-irinotecan combination was

746

pharmacotherapy volume 28, number 6, 2008

used in a second-line setting compared with
irinotecan alone. all patients in the study had
failed first-line therapy with oxaliplatin and
fluoropyrimidine. the trial, however, failed to
show significant improvement in overall survival,
probably due to 42% of patients in the irinotecan
monotherapy group crossing over to the
cetuximab combination group.
the national cancer institute of canada
(ncic) clinical trials group (ctg) and the
australasian gastro-intestinal trials group
(agitg) have completed a phase iii randomized
cetuximab monotherapy trial in previously
treated patients.27 the trial compared the efficacy
of cetuximab monotherapy plus best supportive
care with best supportive care alone in patients
with egfr-positive colorectal cancer. patients
were required to have failed irinotecan and
oxaliplatin therapy before enrollment. the trial
enrolled 572 patients from november
2003–august 2005, and the results were
presented at the 2007 american association for
cancer research annual meeting. the study
showed significantly better time to tumor
progression and overall survival in the cetuximab
group. the hazard risk for time to tumor
progression was 0.68 (95% ci 0.57–0.80,
p<0.0001) in favor of cetuximab. the median
overall survival was 6.1 and 4.6 months
(p=0.005) in the cetuximab and best supportive
care–alone group, respectively. objective
response rate of 6.6% was reported in the
cetuximab group. this is the first study, to our
knowledge, to show statistically significant
improvement in overall survival with monoclonal
antibodies alone in patients with refractory
colorectal cancer.
the bond and ncic-ctg–agitg trials
confirmed the results of cetuximab combination
and monotherapy phase ii trials.28–30 two phase
ii trials evaluated cetuximab monotherapy in
patients with refractory colorectal cancer that
expressed egfr. 29, 30 both trials included
patients who failed prior irinotecan-based
regimens. in the one trial,30 all 346 patients had
previously progressed while receiving an
oxaliplatin-based regimen, compared with 14% of
the 57 patients in the other study.29 these two
trials had response rates of 11.6% and 9%,
respectively. the response rates of these phase ii
trials were similar to the 10.8% response rate
reported in the cetuximab monotherapy group of
the bond trial.25 the progression-free survival
was consistent, at 1.4 months in both trials. the
overall median survival rates were reported to be

6.6 and 6.4 months, respectively.29, 30 an italian
phase ii trial evaluated cetuximab in combination
with irinotecan in patients with egfr-expressing
tumors.28 fifty-five patients failed both the firstline therapy of an oxaliplatin-based regimen and
then the irinotecan-based regimen as a secondline therapy. in this trial, patients received
irinotecan at a dosage of 90 mg/m 2 /week.
overall, patients had a 25.4% response rate and a
median survival of 9.8 months.
the monoclonal antibody erbitux in a
european pre-license (mabel) study,31 which is
an ongoing, multicenter, noncontrolled study of
cetuximab plus irinotecan in a setting similar to
the italian phase ii study, 28 should further
strengthen the evidence for efficacy of cetuximab
in the refractory setting. to our knowledge, this
will be the largest study in this patient
population (> 1400 patients).
similar to cetuximab,  xxxd2838xxx  monotherapy
also has been evaluated (table 2).32 in this pivotal
phase iii trial,  xxxd2838xxx  was evaluated in
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
refractory to fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan, and
oxaliplatin. it was a randomized, open-label,
controlled multicenter study. patients were
required to express at least 1% or higher egfr
staining per immunohistochemistry. patients
were randomly assigned to receive  xxxd2838xxx 
6 mg/kg once every 2 weeks (231 patients) or
best supportive care (232 patients). the primary
end point of the study was progression-free
survival. the baseline demographics were
similar between the two groups. the overall
median age of patients in the trial was 62 years,
and 85% of the patients had an eastern
cooperative oncology group performance status
of 0 or 1. also, 35% of the patients had been
previously treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.
in an intent-to-treat analysis,  xxxd2838xxx 
was significantly more effective than best
supportive care. the  xxxd2838xxx  group had a
46% decrease in risk of progression compared
with best supportive care (hazard ratio 0.54, 95%
ci 0.44–0.66). overall, median progression-free
survival was 8 weeks in the  xxxd2838xxx  group
and 7.3 weeks in the best supportive care group
(p<0.0001). mean progression-free survival was
13.8 weeks for patients receiving  xxxd2838xxx 
and 8.5 weeks for those receiving only best
supportive care (p<0.0001). patients receiving
 xxxd2838xxx  had a statistically significant
improved response rate of 10% compared with
those getting best supportive care. none of the
patients in the best supportive care group

responded. no statistically significant difference
was noted in overall survival, which could be
explained by the fact that most patients (76%) in
the best supportive care group were given
 xxxd2838xxx  after disease progression.
the egfr monoclonal antibodies are also
being studied in combination with oxaliplatin,
fluorouracil, and bevacizumab-based regimens.33–35
safety and efficacy of cetuximab have been
evaluated with folfox4 ( xxxd2147xxx 
[ xxxd2462xxx ], infusional fluorouracil, and
oxaliplatin [different dosing regimen than with
folfox]),  xxxd467xxx , and bevacizumab in these
small trials. all of these regimens have shown
activity and safety of cetuximab in patients with
refractory metastatic cancer. addition of
bevacizumab to irinotecan and cetuximab
showed a favorable response rate of 37% (bond
2 trial), compared with 23–25% reported in
previous trials of cetuximab plus irinotecan
alone. 25, 28, 34 the same trial showed that the
addition of bevacizumab to cetuximab can
improve the response rate to 20%, compared with
11% in the previously reported trial.25, 34 the
bevacizumab-irinotecan-cetuximab group (43
patients) had a median survival of 14.5 months
compared with 11.4 months in the bevacizumabcetuximab group (40 patients).34
treatment-naïve patients
promising results of egfr monoclonal
antibodies in the setting of refractory metastases

have led to their evaluation as first-line therapy.
there are two phase iii trials evaluating the
efficacy of egfr monoclonal antibodies in
treatment-naïve patients with metastatic
colorectal cancer. 36, 37 in the cetuximab
combined with irinotecan in first line therapy
for metastatic colorectal cancer (crystal)
trial, egfr-positive, treatment-naïve patients
were randomly assigned to receive  xxxd467xxx  plus
cetuximab (608 patients) or  xxxd467xxx  alone (609
patients).36 the response rate was significantly
higher in the cetuximab group, at 46.9%
compared with 38.7% in the  xxxd467xxx -alone
group. cetuximab also resulted in significantly
better progression-free survival at 8.9 months
(95% ci 8–9.5 mo) compared with 8 months
(95% ci 7.6–9 mo) in the  xxxd467xxx -alone group
(p=0.036). the response rate and progressionfree survival of the  xxxd467xxx  regimen are
consistent with the results of previously
published phase iii trials of  xxxd467xxx . 38–40
overall, both treatments were well tolerated, with
the cetuximab regimen reporting higher rates of
grade 3–4 neutropenia, diarrhea, and skin
reaction adverse events. the crystal trial
suggested a modest clinical benefit of cetuximab
as first-line therapy compared with bevacizumab,
which is used in clinical practice today.4, 36, 41
the  xxxd2838xxx  advanced colorectal
cancer evaluation (pacce) trial did not suggest
a benefit of  xxxd2838xxx  as first-line therapy. in
a march 22, 2007 press release, the manufacturer
of  xxxd2838xxx  announced the discontinuation

748

pharmacotherapy volume 28, number 6, 2008

of the phase iii trial, which compared
 xxxd2838xxx  plus standard first-line treatment
with first-line treatment alone.37 patients were
randomly assigned to receive oxaliplatin and
irinotecan-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab
with or without  xxxd2838xxx . the decision to
discontinue was made based on a preliminary
review of a preplanned evaluation of efficacy after
the first 231 events, which were defined as death
or disease progression. statistical analysis
revealed a significant difference in progressionfree survival in favor of the control group. based
on this information, the manufacturer conducted
an unplanned overall survival analysis to that
point, which was consistent with the aforementioned progression-free survival data.
there are many phase ii trials of egfr
monoclonal antibodies in combination with
other chemotherapy regimens as first-line
treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. of
these, four have reported progression-free
survival and safety of the regimens.24, 42–44 similar
to the  xxxd2838xxx  pacce trial, cetuximab has
been evaluated in combination with an oxaliplatin and bevacizumab regimen. the difference
is that cetuximab was evaluated in a small (67
patients), nonrandomized, noncontrolled trial.44
cetuximab was given with modified folfox6
(same agents as in folfox4, but agents are
given at different dosages and duration) and
bevacizumab. of the 58 evaluable patients, the
study showed a response rate of 55% and a
median progression-free survival of 9.6 months.
similarly, cetuximab in combination with
 xxxd425xxx  850 mg/m2 twice/day for 14 days
with irinotecan (xeliri) showed an overall
response rate of 40% and a median duration of
response of 8.8 months in 55 evaluable patients.43
another group evaluated the safety and
tolerability of adding cetuximab to irinotecanfluorouracil- xxxd2147xxx . in this small trial, they
evaluated 21 patients with untreated metastatic
colorectal cancer expressing egfr.42 cetuximab
was given with either low- or high-dose
fluorouracil at either 1500 or 2000 mg/m2, plus
irinotecan 280 mg/m 2 /week. six patients
received low-dose fluorouracil, and 15 patients
received high-dose fluorouracil. the study
showed dose-limiting toxicities in the low-dose
fluorouracil group and three dose-limiting
toxicities in the high-dose group (two patients
had grade 3 diarrhea and one patient had grade
4). the study had a median time to progression
of 9.9 months and median survival of 33 months.
in a phase ii trial,  xxxd2838xxx  was evaluated

as a first-line agent for the treatment of metastatic
colorectal cancer.24 this was a noncontrolled,
two-part trial evaluating  xxxd2838xxx  in
combination with ifl (part 1) or in combination
with  xxxd467xxx  (part 2). the study was divided
because of toxicity issues that developed with the
original regimen in part 1. the study was small,
with only 19 patients in part 1 and 24 patients in
part 2. with respect to the secondary end points,
the study found that nine patients and eight
patients had partial responses in parts 1 and 2,
respectively. progression-free survival was found
to be 5.6 and 10.9 months in the two groups,
respectively. overall median survival was 17
months in part 1 and 22.5 months in part 2.
several phase iii trials of cetuximab and
 xxxd2838xxx  in treatment-naïve and previously
treated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
are ongoing; these will provide additional efficacy
and safety information of egfr monoclonal
antibodies (table 3).45–47
clinical considerations
expression of  xxxg682xxx 
expression of egfr has been reported in most
colorectal cancer diagnoses. both egfr
monoclonal antibodies are approved for use in
patients with tumors that have been determined
to express egfr.13, 14 however, data from the
bond trial25 and the other two phase ii trials29, 30
show that intensity of egfr staining does not
correlate with efficacy. also, the  xxxd2838xxx 
trial did not show an appreciable difference in the
hazard ratio in patients with less than or more
than 10% egfr expression of evaluated cells.32
these findings may relate to the absence of data
indicating the prognostic value of egfr and
colorectal tumor response. one group of authors
evaluated 16 egfr-negative patients treated with
cetuximab plus irinotecan (14 patients) or
cetuximab alone (two patients) who were
refractory to previous chemotherapy. 48 this
study, although small, identified a 25% response
rate. another study showed a 30% response rate
in 10 egfr-negative patients treated with
irinotecan and cetuximab. 49 a third study
showed an 11% response rate in nine egfrnegative patients treated with cetuximab alone.30
these findings suggest that egfr-negative
tumors have the potential to respond to egfr
monoclonal antibody therapy and that egfr
immunohistochemistry before therapy does not
appear to be needed.

appearance of rash

rash

unlike egfr expression, an association
between appearance or intensity of rash and
efficacy has been observed in patients treated
with egfr monoclonal antibodies. 25, 29, 30, 32, 49
post hoc analysis of the bond trial showed a
significantly better response rate of 13% in
patients having a skin reaction compared with
0% in patients with no skin reaction. this
difference in response rates was also consistent in
the combination group. the median overall
survival was also found to be prolonged in
patients with skin reaction (8–9 vs 2.5–3 mo).25
in addition, patients with a grade 3 or 4 rash had
better response rates compared with those with a
grade 1 or 2 rash (59% vs 20% cetuximabirinotecan and 25% vs 11% cetuximab alone).
the same relationship was seen in the  xxxd2838xxx  study.32 patients receiving  xxxd2838xxx 
who had grade 2–4 skin toxicity revealed a
statistically significant (41%) reduction in death,
compared with those with a grade 1 skin
reaction. a pooled analysis of five  xxxd2838xxx 
clinical trials showed 8.5 versus 4.5 months
median survival in patients with grade 2–4 skin
toxicity versus those with grade 1.50 although
rash appears to be a good prognostic factor in
responsiveness of the tumor, its interpretation
remains a challenge. rash appears in responders
as well as in nonresponders.25, 32 the everest
trial—a cetuximab dose-escalation study in
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with no
or slight skin reactions while receiving cetuximab
standard-dose treatment—is currently evaluating
the efficacy of cetuximab and irinotecan.47 the
study is designed to increase the cetuximab
dosage in an escalation group if the patient does
not have a grade 2 or higher rash at the third
week of treatment.

although skin reactions have been reported in
80–90% of patients receiving egfr monoclonal
antibodies, the severe grade 3 or 4 acne-type
(acneiform) rash is reported in only 5–9% of
patients.29, 30 the rash usually manifests itself on
the face, upper chest, and back; however, it is not
limited to these areas.14, 29 most patients develop
the rash in the first 3 weeks of therapy, which is
reversible upon discontinuation. acne-like rash
can be managed with topical and/or systemic
therapy.  xxxd1717xxx  1% gel can be
used for the inflammatory pustular lesions.52 it
also can be combined with benzoyl peroxide 5%
gel. in severe cases, antibiotics such as tetracycline,
minocycline, or doxycycline should be used. for
dry skin, a moisturizing cream or ointment is
recommended.52
diarrhea
diarrhea is more common in patients who are
receiving the combination of irinotecan and
cetuximab; however, it has also been reported
with egfr monoclonal antibody monotherapy.25,
30
the cetuximab package insert reports diarrhea
in 72% of patients, with 22% experiencing grade
3 or 4 diarrhea when cetuximab is given in
combination with irinotecan. when cetuximab
was given as monotherapy, 28% experienced
diarrhea, 2% of whom had grade 3 or 4 toxicity.14
 xxxd2838xxx  has shown similar data: 21% of
patients experienced some form of diarrhea, and
2% had grade 3 or 4 toxicity.13 patients should be
educated regarding adequate fluid intake and
administration of loperamide in the event of
diarrhea. if patients develop diarrhea,
loperamide every 2–4 hours should be used until
12 hours have passed after the last episode of
diarrhea. in particular, patients taking irinotecan
could have an increased risk of delayed diarrhea.

adverse effects
as a class, the egfr monoclonal antibodies
are relatively well tolerated either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy.
they are not associated with typical chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression, mucositis,
nausea and/or vomiting, or alopecia. the most
common adverse events reported are rash,
diarrhea, and hypomagnesemia.13, 14, 25, 32, 51 some
of the more serious issues that require dosage
adjustment or discontinuation include infusionrelated reactions, dermatologic conditions, and
pulmonary toxicity.25, 32

hypomagnesemia
hypomagnesemia was not identified as a
common adverse event of egfr monoclonal
antibody therapy at the time of the cetuximab
registrational trial. postmarketing analyses have
now shown that cetuximab and  xxxd2838xxx 
therapy can be associated with severe hypomagnesemia.32, 51, 53, 54 retrospective analyses of
cetuximab trials have shown an frequency of
50–65%, and a prospective phase iii trial of
 xxxd2838xxx  has shown a 36% overall rate of
hypomagnesemia. cases of severe grades 3 and 4

egfr monoclonal antibodies for colorectal cancer jean and shah
hypomagnesemia have been reported in 10–27%
of patients receiving cetuximab and 3% of patients
receiving  xxxd2838xxx .32, 51, 54 at times, patients
may also present with accompanying hypocalcemia
and hypokalemia.32, 51, 53, 54 in the cases of severe
hypomagnesemia, intravenous replacement was
often required.13 most cases of hypomagnesemia
were identified at 6–8 weeks of egfr monoclonal antibody therapy. one study reported that
it might take up to 4 weeks to recover after
discontinuation of cetuximab. 54 magnesium
wasting syndrome with inappropriate urine
excretion is the suggested mechanism, per one
group of authors.51 inhibition of egfr in the
nephron may reversibly impair function of the
proteins involved in active transport of extracellular magnesium.
hypersensitivity
the randomized phase iii epic trial released
its safety data of cetuximab in combination with
irinotecan as second-line therapy (800 patients).55
a total of 3629 chemotherapy cycles were
administered to patients, with a median of 4
cycles/patient. overall, 4% of the patients had
infusion reactions to cetuximab. four patients
(0.5%) experienced severe infusion reactions, but
none was fatal.26 the package insert reports a
similar finding and that 90% of reactions occur
during the first infusion.14 with  xxxd2838xxx ,
1% of infusion reactions were grade 3 or 4, with
an overall frequency of 3%. 13 unlike with
cetuximab, however, the use of premedication
was not standardized in  xxxd2838xxx  clinical
trials, since it is a fully human antibody.13 also,
one case report indicates  xxxd2838xxx  was given
successfully to a patient with a previous severe
reaction to cetuximab.56
other adverse events
other common adverse events reported with
egfr monoclonal antibodies are fatigue,
asthenia, dyspnea, paronychia (infection of the
nail fold surrounding the nail plate), abdominal
pain, nausea, and anorexia. 13, 14, 25, 32 ocular
toxicity was reported with  xxxd2838xxx  in 15%
of patients. ocular events include conjunctivitis,
ocular hyperemia, increased lacrimation, and eye
or eyelid irritation.13 interstitial lung disease was
reported in three of 633 cetuximab-treated
patients (< 0.5%), one case of which actually
resulted in death. two of the patients had
preexisting pulmonary fibrosis that resulted in
exacerbations while taking cetuximab and

751

irinotecan. 14 for  xxxd2838xxx , there was a
similar occurrence, with less than 1% of patients
experiencing interstitial lung disease; however,
once a fatality was associated with interstitial
lung disease, patients with preexisting lung
disease were excluded from the studies. both
egfr monoclonal antibodies are pregnancy
category c drugs, and no drug interaction has
been studied or identified with other agents.13
dosage and administration
cetuximab carries a united states food and
drug administration–approved indication for use
in combination with irinotecan for the treatment
of egfr-expressing metastatic colorectal
carcinoma in patients who are refractory to
irinotecan-based therapy. it is also approved as a
monotherapy in the event patients are intolerant
to irinotecan. the recommended dosing is for
patients to receive a 400-mg/m2 loading dose by a
2-hour infusion followed by weekly infusions of
250 mg/m2 over 1 hour.14
 xxxd2838xxx  is indicated for use in patients
with metastatic colorectal cancer who express
egfr with disease progression while receiving or
after fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan–
based therapy.  xxxd2838xxx  is dosed at 6 mg/kg
and is infused over 1 hour every 2 weeks. if doses
greater than 1000 mg are required, they should be
administered over 90 minutes instead.13
it is recommended that patients receive
intravenous diphenhydramine 50 mg before
administration of cetuximab to prevent possible
infusion-related reactions.14 the use of premedication with  xxxd2838xxx  was not standardized
in the clinical trial, and therefore, treatment with
a histamine antagonist is not required.11, 13
no dosage adjustment is suggested for
cetuximab or  xxxd2838xxx  in the setting of
hepatic or renal impairment. dosage adjustment
is recommended in the setting of infusion-related
reactions or dermatologic toxicity. if the patient
experiences either grade 1 or 2 infusion
reactions, the infusion rate should be reduced by
50%. if the reaction is severe grade 3 or 4, then
egfr monoclonal antibodies should be
discontinued permanently. in the event of severe
dermatologic toxicity, subsequent infusions
should be held until improvement to at least
grade 2 toxicity. subsequent doses of  xxxd2838xxx  should be reduced to 50% of the
scheduled dose. the cetuximab dose can be
reduced to 150 mg/m2 based on the severity of
dermatologic toxicity.13, 14

conclusion

acknowledgments

the availability of egfr monoclonal antibodies
has broadened the therapies available for
metastatic colorectal cancer. cetuximab and
 xxxd2838xxx  have demonstrated efficacy against
metastatic colorectal cancer previously resistant
to multiple chemotherapy regimens, including
irinotecan and oxaliplatin. in particular,
cetuximab, with or without irinotecan, has been
evaluated extensively in phase iii (bond, epic,
and ncic) and phase ii trials. it has shown
significant activity as second- or third-line
treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. however,
 xxxd2838xxx  monotherapy has been evaluated
primarily as a third-line therapy. in addition,
cetuximab has significant synergistic activity
when administered in combination with
irinotecan. based on the bond and epic trials,
cetuximab in combination with irinotecan has
better efficacy compared with cetuximab and
irinotecan alone. therefore, combination
treatment should be a first option unless the
patient is not a good candidate for irinotecan in a
refractory setting.
based on the crystal trial, cetuximab has
shown improved activity as first-line therapy
with  xxxd467xxx . the role of egfr monoclonal
antibodies in the treatment of chemotherapynaïve patients needs to be further evaluated, as
bevacizumab is the standard monoclonal
antibody in combination with irinotecan or
oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. multiple
interim analyses have proved the safety of egfr
monoclonal antibodies in combination with
various chemotherapy regimens. because of the
specificity, egfr monoclonal antibodies are less
cytotoxic compared with chemotherapy. skin
reaction, diarrhea, hypomagnesemia, and
infusion reactions are the adverse events to be
monitored when administering egfr monoclonal
antibodies.
the value of egfr expression and rash as a
prognostic indicator needs to be further
established. expression of egfr is not likely to
determine tumor response. patients who develop
rash are likely to respond better; however, rash
also develops in individuals who do not respond.
the optimal egfr monoclonal antibody dosage
in patients without rash needs to be further
evaluated. clinical trials published to date have
not included patients with metastatic colorectal
cancer refractory to bevacizumab. we hope
future egfr monoclonal antibody studies will
provide answers to these questions.

we would like to thank patrick medina, pharm.d.,
bcop, and melissa lockman for their critical review
and assistance in the preparation of the manuscript.
