abstract: degeneration of dopaminergic neurons
is one of the major features of parkinson’s disease.
many redox-active metals such as iron and manganese
have been implicated in neuronal degeneration characterized by symptoms resembling parkinson’s disease.
even though, arsenic, which is another redox-active
metal, has been shown to affect the central monoaminergic systems, but its potential in causing dopaminergic cell degeneration has not been fully known. hence,
the present study was designed to investigate arsenic
signaling especially that is mediated by reactive oxygen species and its effect on early transcription factors in dopamine producing mesencephalic cell line
1rb3 an27 . these mesencephalic cells were treated
with low concentrations of sodium arsenite (0.1, 0.5,
1, 5, and 10 m) and incubated for different periods of
time (0–4 h). arsenite was cytotoxic at 5 and 10 m concentrations only after 72-h incubation period. arsenite, in a dose-dependent manner, induced generation of
reactive oxygen species (ros) and activation of early
transcription factors such as nuclear factor-b (nf-b)
and  xxxg1222xxx  (ap-1) as shown by electro mobility shift assay. incubation of antioxidants, either nacetyl-l-cysteine (50 m) or -tocopherol (50 m) with
1 m arsenite, suppressed ros generation. arsenite
at 1 m concentration was sufficient for maximal activation of nf-b and ap-1 activation. time kinetics
studies showed maximal activation of nf-b by 1 m
concentration of arsenite was seen at 120 min and correlated with complete degradation of ib at 60 min.
similarly, maximal activation of ap-1 by 1 m concentration of arsenite occurred at 120 min. n-acetyll-cysteine at 50 m concentration inhibited arseniteinduced nf-b and ap-1. in addition, arsenite was
shown to induce phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (erk) 1/2 at concentrations of

introduction
metals are trace elements that are essential for the
human body. however, certain metals and their derivatives are toxic and have a wide variety of adverse effects,
including carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity, and immunotoxicity [1]. arsenic (as) has long been considered as a
toxic metal. arsenic is an environmental contaminant
found naturally in ground water. arsenic contamination also results from industrial and agricultural uses
[2].
arsenic may also be a teratogen [3] and affects the
development of the central nervous system. both pentavalent and trivalent arsenic have been shown to cross
the placental barrier and selectively accumulate in the
fetal neuroepithelium in early gestation [4–6]. developmental exposure to arsenate or arsenite causes exencephaly and neural tube defects [7–13]. arsenite, a
trivalent arsenic [as(iii)] is about 10 times more toxic
than arsenate that is a pentavalent arsenic [as(v)] in
causing neural tube effects [8]. some important effects
of chronic arsenic exposure on the cns are changes in
the content and release patterns of dopamine and other
neurotransmitters [14,15]. the mechanisms of arsenic
toxicity are not clearly known.

the selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra is one of the principal features of pathogenesis of human parkinson’s disease
[16]. mechanism of dopaminergic neuronal degeneration is not fully understood in parkinson’s disease,
but evidence suggests that oxidative stress is involved
[17]. one source of oxidative stress that is unique to
dopaminergic neurons is the presence of dopamine
(da) itself, as da can form ros and quinines through
two different pathways. first, da is metabolized via
 xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  (mao) to produce  xxxd2298xxx  (h2 o2 ) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid [18].
h2 o2 , if not reduced by cellular antioxidant mechanisms such as gsh (glutatathione) and gsh peroxidase, can react with transition metals such as iron to
form hydoxy radical [19]. second, the catechol ring of
da can undergo oxidation to form da quinine and ros
•
such as h2 o2 and superoxide anion (o2− ) in a reaction
that can occur either spontaneously in the presence of
transition of metals or enzymatically [20,21].
increased levels of iron are found in the brain of
parkinson’s disease (pd) patients [22,23]. the substantia nigra (sn), one of the most vulnerable brain regions in pd, has selectively increased levels of iron
[23,24]. iron has been implicated because it can trigger redox reactions that are involved in neurodegeneration [25]. several epidemiological studies suggest
that long-term occupational and dietary metal exposure is associated with the occurrence of pd [26,27]. it
has been reported in the literature about significant associations of pd with manganese and copper, as well
as combinations of lead with copper and iron, and iron
with copper, for workers with more than 20 years of occupational contact [28]. a combination of manganese,
iron, and aluminum might favor the development of
pd after 30 years of exposure [29]. the only positive
dose–response relationship was found between mercury exposure and pd but not for other metals [30,31].
in contrast to an earlier study [32], a later study reported a moderate association between iron intake from
foods and pd and apparent joint effect of iron and manganese [27,33]. thus, other transition metals in combination with endogenous iron could play a role in the
neurodegeneration.
experimental support for the contribution of oxidative damage to arsenic neurotoxicity is accumulating. arsenic, in the presence of fe2+ , by fenton reaction
or haber–weiss reaction, is known to cause cellular
injury through ros generation [34,35]. some of the
most prominent toxic effects demonstrated in arsenicexposed cells, such as dna damage [36,37] and apoptosis [38–40], have been traced to the generation of
reactive oxygen species (ros) during oxidative stress
caused by arsenite [41–45]. chronic exposure to low levels of arsenic in rats results in depletion of glutathione

volume 19, number 2, 2005

and increases  xxxd2811xxx  and lipid peroxidation in the brain [46–48].
arsenite was demonstrated to promote or alter
gene expression and modify intra- and intercellular
communication [49]. interference with signal transduction pathways is one of several modes of action
that has been proposed for arsenic [50,51]. alterations
in intracellular oxidation/reduction (redox) reactions
have been shown to activate signal cascades that regulate early response genes. these genes are believed to
function in a protective or reparative capacity. stressinduced activation of these early response genes appears to rely, at least in part, on changes in intracellular redox status. transcription factors, such as activator
protein-1 (ap-1) and nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-b),
play a vital role in these responses. both ap-1 and nfb are considered stress response transcription factors,
which regulate the expression of a variety of downstream target genes, such as proinflammatory genes
that are known to be involved with cellular antioxidant
defense mechanisms [52]. nf-b is maintained in the
cytoplasm of nonstimulated cells through interaction
with specific inhibitors, ibs [53]. in response to proinflammatory stimuli, the ikbs are rapidly phosphorylated and degraded by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, resulting in the release of free nf-b dimers, which
translocate to the nucleus to induce transcription of target genes [54]. in contrast, the ap-1 heterodimers are
constitutively localized within the nucleus and transactivation of ap-1 is achieved through phosphorylation of
its activation domain by c- xxxg1370xxx  (jnk)
[55].
arsenic has been shown previously to affect transcription and expression of proto-oncogenes in mammalian cells in culture. however, many previous studies used only short-term exposures and significantly
higher (more toxic) doses of arsenic [50,52,56–58]. there
are some evidence showing how long-term exposure
with low-dose arsenic affects signal transduction pathways [59]. arsenic concentrations used in all these studies ranged from 1 to 500 m. the concentrations below
10 m are considered as low where as concentrations
greater than 10 m are considered as high concentrations [60]. many previous studies that were conducted
to study the short-term exposure of arsenite used significantly higher doses of arsenite (i.e., >10 m) that are
very toxic and they inhibited nf-b where as low and
noncytotoxic concentrations of arsenic (i.e., <10 m)
activated nf-b [60]. in human gm847 fibroblast cell
line, short-term exposure (3–24 h) of arsenite induced
early transcription factors such as nf-b and ap-1 even
at very low concentrations such as 0.1 and 0.5 m [59].
in this study, we report the exposure of dopaminergic cells 1rb3 an27 to arsenite for shorter durations
(≤4 h and at low concentrations, i.e., 0.1–10.0 m) alters

the cellular redox status and activation of these early
transcription factors in a very significant manner. this
1rb3 an27 cell line, which produces dopamine, also
expresses  xxxg2276xxx ,  xxxg2149xxx ,
 xxxg702xxx , and nestin, was derived from
fetal rat mesencephalon by transfection with plasmid
vector (psvneo

from sv40 virus [61].

mesencephalic cell line namely 1rb3 an27 was
grown in culture medium rpmi 1640 supplemented
with 2 mmol/l glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin,
100 g/ml streptomycin, 5% fetal bovine serum and
5% horse serum at 37◦ c and in 5% co2 atmosphere. dr

cell line to us.

cytotoxicity assay
the cytotoxicity was assayed by the 3-(4,5dimethyl-2-thiozolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2 h-tetrazolium
bromide (mtt) dye uptake. briefly, 1rb3 an27 cells
(5000 cells/well of 96-well plate) were incubated
with different concentrations of sodium arsenite with
the final volume of 0.1 ml for different periods of
time (4, 24, and 72 h) at 37◦ c. thereafter, 25 l of
mtt solution (5 mg/ml in pbs) was added to each
well. after 2-h incubation at 37◦ c, 0.1 ml of the
extraction buffer (20% sds, 50% dimethylformamide)
was added. after an overnight incubation at 37◦ c,

the absorbance was read at 570 nm using microplate
reader versamax (molecular devices, sunnyvale,
california), with the extraction buffer as blank. the
cell viability in response to the treatment with arsenite
was calculated as percentage of cell viability = (o.d.
treated/o.d. control) × 100.

reactive oxygen species generation
intracellular accumulation of ros was determined
with 2 ,7 -dichlorofluorescin diacetate (h2 dcf). this
nonfluorescent compound accumulates within cells
upon deacetylation, h2 dcf then reacts with ros
to form fluorescent dichlorofluorescein (dcf). the
1rb3 an27 cells (2 × 106 /ml) were incubated with different concentrations of arsenite for 2 h at 37◦ c. in
another experiment, antioxidants namely n-acetyl-lcysteine, 50 m, (nac), and -tocopherol (50 m),
each of them was incubated with arsenite for similar
duration and the levels of ros were measured. after treatment, cells were transferred to eppendorf tubes
and washed twice in pbs and resuspended in 100 l
of krebs ringer-bicarbonate (krb) buffer. protein was
measured using biorad protein assay reagent by bradford method [62]. appropriate volume of cell suspension equivalent to 100 g protein was made up to final
volume of 100 l with krb buffer and incubated with
10 l h2 dcf (10 m in dmso) in microtiter plate for
3 h at 37◦ c. cellular fluorescence was monitored on a
fluoroskan ascent fluorometer (labsystems, helsinki,
finland) using an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and
emission wavelength of 527 nm.

electrophoretic mobility shift
assays (emsa)
mesencephalic cells were plated in 60-mm
petridish and pretreated at 60% confluent state with
different concentrations of sodium arsenite for a period
of 4 h at 37◦ c and in 5% co2 atmosphere. in some of
the experiments, the cells were treated with antioxidant
n- xxxd68xxx  (50 m) along with 1 m arsenite
for a period of 2 h. and then, nuclear extracts were prepared and activation of nf-b and ap-1 were analyzed
by emsa as previously described [63].
briefly, cells were washed with cold pbs and
suspended in 100 l of lysis buffer (10 mm hepes; ph
7.9), 10 mm kcl, 0.1 mm edta, 0.1 mm egta, 1 mm
dtt, 0.5 mm pmsf, 2 g/ml leupeptin, 2 g/ ml
aprotinin, and 0.5 mg/ml  xxxd302xxx ). cells were
lysed with 3.1 l of 10% nonidet p-40. the nuclear
pellet was resuspended in 25 l of ice-cold extraction
buffer [20 mm hepes (ph 7.9), 0.4 m nacl, 1 mm

was either used immediately or stored at −70◦ c for
later use. the protein content was measured by the
method of bradford [62]. emsas were performed by
incubating 4 g protein of the nuclear extract with 16
fmol of 32 p end-labeled, 45-mer double-stranded nf-b
oligonucleotide from the hiv-1 long terminal repeat,
5 -ttgttacaagggactttccgctggggactttccagggaggcgtgg-3 (bold indicates nf-b

in a binding buffer [25 mm hepes (ph 7.9), 0.5 mm
edta, 0.5 mm dtt, 1% nonidet p-40, 5% glycerol,
and 50 mm nacl] for 15 min at 37◦ c as described
previously. the dna–protein complex formed was
separated from the oligonucleotide on 7.5% native
polyacrylamide gel using buffer containing 50 mm
tris, 200 mm glycine (ph 8.5), and 1 mm edta and
then the gel was dried. visualization and quantitation
of radioactive bands were performed using personal
molecular imager fx (biorad, hercules, ca) using
quantity one software.
the emsa for ap-1 was performed as described for
nf-b using 32 p end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides. to assay ap-1, 4 g of nuclear extract
protein was incubated with 16 fmol of the 32 p-endlabeled ap-1 consensus oligonucleotide 5 -cgcttga
tgactcagccggaa-3 (bold indicates the ap-1
binding site) for 15 min at 37◦ c, and then the dna–
protein complexes formed were resolved from free
oligonucleotide on 6% native polyacrylamide gels. the
radioactive bands were visualized and quantified as indicated above.

western blotting for ib
the cytoplasmic extracts from treated and untreated cells were used to examine ib by western blot
method as described previously [64]. after the nf-b
activation reaction as described above, postnuclear extracts were resolved on 10% sds-polyacrylamide gels
to assay ib. after running the gels, the proteins were
electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose filters and probed
with rabbit polyclonal antibody against ib and bands
were detected by chemiluminescence (ecl, amersham, arlington heights, il). the bands were quantitated by densitometer scan using labworks software
version 4.0 (uvp bioimaging systems, upland, ca).

sodium o-vanadate. the protein concentration in the
supernatant was determined and then resolved with
50 g of protein/lane on 10% sds-page. after the
electrophoresis, the proteins were electrotransferred
to nitrocellulose filters, probed with the phosphospecific anti- xxxd1355xxx /42 erk (thr202 /tyr204 ) ab (new england biolabs, beverley, ma) raised in rabbits (1/3000
dilution). then the membrane was incubated with
peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit igg (1/3000 dilution), and bands were detected by chemiluminescence
(ecl, amersham).

discussion

figure 5. time-dependent activation of nf-b by arsenite in
1rb3 an27 cells. cells were exposed to arsenite (1 m) for different
durations (0–240 min) as indicated and then activation was determined in the nuclear extracts by electrophoretic mobility shift assay.
similar results were obtained in three independent experiments.

the present study was attempted to investigate the
effect of arsenic at low concentrations, i.e., ≤10 m in
mesencephalic cell line 1rb3 an27 . earlier reports on
arsenic that were reviewed, considered arsenic below
10 m as low concentrations that are nontoxic to most
cell types. whereas, concentrations above 10 m are
considered as high and are very toxic to majority of cell
types [60]. this cell line produces dopamine (da) and
expresses  xxxg2276xxx ,  xxxg2149xxx ,
 xxxg702xxx , and nestin [61]. exposure of
cells to durations from 4 to 24 h to arsenite in all the

caused degradation ib by 30 min and with maximum
degradation by 60 min. the disappearance and reappearance of ib corresponded with the kinetics of nfb activation.

arsenite induced ap-1 activation
similar to nf-b activation, arsenic also activated
another transcription factor, ap-1, in 1rb3 an27 cells in
a dose-dependent manner, with maximum activation
at 1 m (figure 8). when examined the time course,
ap-1 activation, as induced by 1 m concentration of
arsenite, reached its maximum in 2 h (figure 9). but,
incubation of antioxidant nac at 50 m concentration
for 2 h suppressed the arsenite-induced ap-1 activation
(figure 10).

periods (0–240 min) and ib was detected in the cytosolic fraction
by western blot using polyclonal antibody against ib as described
in materials and methods section. degradation of ib is started
at 30 min and most of ib degraded at 60 min and reappeared at
120 min. similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. the same western blot membrane was reprobed with monoclonal anti- tubulin antibody to check proper loading of samples.

experiments.

concentrations studied did not show cytotoxicity (data
not shown). when cells were exposed to a much longer
period, i.e., for 72 h, at concentrations ≤1 m, arsenite was not cytotoxic to this cell line but above this
concentration, cell viability was significantly reduced
as shown by mtt assay. thus, the concentrations of
arsenite used in the study, i.e., 0.1–10 m under the
experimental conditions used (i.e., ≤4 h of incubation
period) are nontoxic doses for these dopaminergic cells.
present results have shown that arsenite induced reactive oxygen species (ros) in a dose-dependent manner
in 1rb3 an27 cells. arsenic has been demonstrated to
induce the formation of ros in a wide variety of cells,
including human vascular smooth muscle cells [65],
human–hamster hybrid cells [44], vascular endothelial
cells [57], murine keratinocytes [66], acute  xxxg1785xxx  cells [67], chinese hamster ovary cells
[68], chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells [69], and pe-

reduced oxidative stress induced by arsenite. in previous studies also, antioxidant vitamins such as c and e
had been shown to reverse arsenic toxicity [72]. similarly coadministration of antioxidants reduced arsenicinduced oxidative stress in brain of rats that were exposed to arsenite in drinking water [73].

figure 10. effect of antioxidant n- xxxd68xxx  on arseniteinduced activation of ap-1 in 1rb3 an27 cells. the cells were incubated with arsenite (1 m) and antioxidant n- xxxd68xxx 
(50 m) for 2 h and activation of ap-1 was determined in the nuclear extracts by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. fp = free probe
(probe only); c = control (unstimulated); as = arsenite (1 m); as
+ nac = arsenite (1 m) plus n- xxxd68xxx  (50 m). similar
results were obtained in three independent experiments.

demonstrated to cause dna damage, lipid peroxidation, and protein modification [60]. trivalent arsenic
has been shown to interact with sulfhydryl (sh) group
of biomolecules, an important mechanism of toxicity
[75]. it was also demonstrated that binding of arsenic
to the sh-group of glutathione (gsh) resulted in
accumulation of intracellular ros leading to activation
of caspases [41]. developing brain cells exposed to
arsenic was shown to undergo a loss of glutathione
and an increase in cellular ros leading to apoptosis
[72]. it was shown that ros was involved in the cell
signaling and affected cytoplasmic and nuclear signal
transduction pathways that regulate gene expression
[76]. reports have indicated that ros can act as signaling messengers to activate transcription factors. both
ap-1 and nf-b, which are examples of transcription
factors, considered as stress responsive transcription
factors that govern the expression of proinflammatory
and cytotoxic genes [77].

figure 11. effect of arsenite on phosphorylation of erk in
1rb3 an27 cells. the cells were exposed to various concentrations
of arsenite (0.1–1.0 m) and total cell lysates were assayed for erk
activation by western blotting using antibody specific to phosphospecific  xxxd1355xxx /42 erk. activation of erk was observed following arsenite exposure at different concentration compared to untreated control. similar results were obtained in three independent experiments.
the same western blot membrane was reprobed with monoclonal
anti- tubulin antibody to check proper loading of samples.

our study has clearly shown that arsenite induced activation of transcription factor nf-b in mesencephalic cell line in dose-dependent manner and
1 m was sufficient to induce maximal activation of
nf-b. others have also reported similar nf-b activation by arsenic at low concentrations (0.1–5.0 m) in
gm487 cells, a human fibroblast cell line [59]. whereas,
high concentrations of arsenic (500 m) inhibited nfb in human embryonic kidney cells, hek293, and human bronchial epithelial cells, beas 2b [78]. our results show that arsenic-induced nf-b activation was
accompanied by characteristic ib degradation in a
time-dependent manner in 1rb3 an27 cells. in as(iii)
exposed ecv304 cells, a human endothelial cell line,
similar phosphorylation and degradation of ib were
reported for the activation of nf-b [79]. certain other
studies have shown that exposure to arsenic induced
basal nf-b binding activity but without an increase
in ib phosphorylation nor an increase in translocation in lung epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages
indicating alternative mechanism [43,80]. we have reported earlier from our laboratory that metals such as
lead and manganese (mn2+ ) have also induced nf-b
activation and corresponding degradation of ib in
pc12 cells, a dopaminergic cell line [81,64].
many groups have studied mechanism of nf-b
activation. nf-b is a heterodimer composed of p50
and p65 and is inactive in cytoplasm through association with one of many inhibitors, of which ib is the
most abundant one [82]. signal-induced degradation
involves phosphorylation of two serine residues, s32
and s36. this phosphorylation leads to polyubiquitination of two specific lysines on ib (k21 and k22)
by scf--trcp complex and its degradation by the
26s proteosome [83]. the phosphorylation is accomplished by a specific ib kinase (ikk). this ikk family
is further activated by several upstream kinases such
as mapk kinases, akt, nik, nak, and pkc [60]. we
have previously reported that toxic metals such as lead
and manganese activate nf-b through mitogen activated protein kinase (mapk/erk) activation in pc12
cells [81,64]. since many reports suggest that map kinase activation is required [84], whether arsenite induced map kinase activity was also examined in this
cell type. the kinetics of arsenite-induced mapk activity and nf-b activation indicate that map kinase may
have contributed to nf-b activation. it was shown that
 xxxd1169xxx , an inhibitor of erk activation, inhibited the
activation of nf-b in jb6 cells suggesting upstream
activation of map kinase (erk) essential for nf-b activation [85].
our results showed that, as with nf-b, arsenite
affects ap-1 activation and dna binding in a timeand dose-dependent manner. we have shown in our
earlier studies in dopaminergic cell line namely pc12,

volume 19, number 2, 2005

metals such as lead and manganese also activated ap-1
along with nf-b [64,81,86]. many groups have studied mechanism of ap-1 activation.  xxxg1222xxx 
(ap-1), is another group of transcription factors is composed of hetero- or homodimer subunits of proteins
from fos, jun, jun dimerization partner (jdp), and activating transcription factor (atf) families. ap-1 is activated by a wide variety of stimuli, including growth
factors, inflammatory cytokines, uv radiation, and oxidative stress [87]. arsenic is known to induce activation of ap-1 in a variety of cell types including epithelial
cells, fibroblasts, type ii cells, and alveolar macrophages
[88]. similar arsenic-induced ap-1 activation was also
reported in gm487 fibroblast cell [59], in rat lung epithelial cells [43], in hela cells [89]. ap-1 activation in
mouse epidermal jb6 cells, inhibiting pkc activation
blocked both arsenic-induced ap-1 activity and phosphorylation of the three major classes of map kinases
such as erks (extracellular receptor kinases), c-jun-nterminal kinase (jnk), and p38 kinases, indicating that
pkc is required for map kinase activation [90]. certain other studies indicated that arsenic differentially
activated erks, p38, and jnks to mediate opposing effects (i.e., cell proliferation and apoptosis), which were
dependent of time, dose, and oxidative form of arsenic
and the type of target cell [60]. the activation of jnks
and p38 could induce cell growth arrest and apoptosis
[91]. in rat cerebellar neurons, it was shown that arsenite,  xxxd1891xxx  m concentration, induced selective activation
of p38 and  xxxg1367xxx  [92].
collectively, these results indicate that arsenite, at
low and subcytotoxic concentrations (i.e., 0.1–10 m),
with shorter exposure periods (≤4 h), can induce the
generation of reactive oxygen species causing oxidative stress in this dopaminergic cell line. this in turn
leads to activation of early transcription factors such
as nf-b and ap-1. induction of erk phosphorylation
by arsenite suggests that upstream activation of mapk
may be involved in the activation of transcription factor nf-b. future studies elucidating the role of ca2+ ,
pkc, other map kinases, caspases in this signaling cascade and apoptotic pathway will further help in better
understanding of arsenic-mediated neurotoxic effects.
