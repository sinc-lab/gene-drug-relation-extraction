abstract
post-mortem studies of the human brain indicate that certain gabaa receptor subtypes may be differentially altered in schizophrenia.
increased binding to the total population of gabaa receptors using [3h]muscimol is observed in the post-mortem schizophrenic brain, yet a
proportion of these receptors which bind benzodiazepines and are labelled with [3h]flunitrazepam, show decreased or unaltered expression. data
from animal studies suggest that antipsychotic drugs alter gabaa receptor expression in a subtype selective manner, but in the opposite direction
to that observed in schizophrenia. to broaden our understanding of the effects of antipsychotic drugs on gabaa receptors, we examined the
saturation binding maximum (bmax) and binding affinity (kd) of [3h]muscimol and [3h]flunitrazepam in the prefrontal cortex (pfc),
hippocampus and thalamus of male sd rats that received a sucrose solution containing either haloperidol (1.5 mg/kg), olanzapine (6.5 mg/kg) or
no drug daily for up to 28 days using quantitative receptor autoradiography. [3h]muscimol binding density was increased most prominently in the
pfc after 7 days, with larger and more prolonged effects being induced by the atypical antipsychotic drug olanzapine in subcortical regions. while
no changes were observed in [3h]muscimol binding in any region after 28 days of drug administration, [3h]flunitrazepam binding density (bmax)
was increased for both antipsychotic treatments in the pfc only. these findings confirm that the subset of gabaa receptors sensitive to
benzodiazepines are regulated differently from other gabaa receptor subtypes following antipsychotic drug administration, in a time- and
region-dependent manner.

1. introduction
gabaa receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, composed of
five heterooligomeric membrane-spanning subunits which form a
central pore that conducts chloride ions (karlin, 2002; unwin,
1989). cloning from cdna libraries has identified 16 gabaa
receptor subunits in the mammalian brain, including six alpha
( xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx – xxxg835xxx ), four beta ( xxxg836xxx –beta4), three gamma ( xxxg841xxx – xxxg843xxx ), one delta, one ɛ and one theta
abbreviations: anova, analysis of variance; bmax, saturation binding
maximum (total number of specific binding sites for a ligand binding to a
receptor at equilibrium); hipp, hippocampus; kd, binding affinity constant;
pfc, pre-frontal cortex; thal, thalamus.

subunit (whiting, 2003). consequently, a diversity of gabaa
receptors exist which vary in pharmacological sensitivity and
regional distribution depending on the subunit composition
(chebib and johnston, 2000; mckernan and whiting, 1996).
observations from post-mortem brain tissue of people with
schizophrenia have suggested that certain gabaa receptor
subtypes may be of greater relevance for the treatment of
schizophrenia. [3h]muscimol, a gabaa receptor agonist, binds
to the orthosteric binding site on the receptor and labels the total
population of gabaa receptors, while [3h]flunitrazepam binds
to an allosteric binding site and labels the subset of gabaa
receptors sensitive to benzodiazepines. gabaa receptor binding
studies have shown abnormalities in a number of cortical and
subcortical regions of the schizophrenic brain (benes et al.,
1996b; benes, 1997; dean et al., 2001; deng and huang, 2006;
hanada et al., 1987; kiuchi et al., 1989). of relevance to the

k.j. skilbeck et al. / progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry 32 (2008) 492–498

regions examined in the current study, the number of gabaa
receptors labelled by [3h]muscimol in the prefrontal cortex (pfc)
(benes et al., 1996b; dean et al., 2001; hanada et al., 1987) and
hippocampus (benes et al., 1996a; benes, 1997) are increased in
post-mortem brain tissue from people with schizophrenia. in
contrast, the number of gabaa receptors with benzodiazepine
binding sites labelled by [3h]flunitrazepam are reduced or
unchanged in the prefrontal cortex (pandey et al., 1997) and
hippocampus (benes et al., 1996a; squires et al., 1993) of the
schizophrenic brain. such findings suggest that gabaa receptors
are affected by the disease in a subtype-dependent fashion.
concerns about studies of post-mortem brain tissue have
arisen due to the potential confounding effects of pre-mortem
drug treatment of subjects used in such studies. this is of
particular concern given that certain antipsychotic drugs are
known to directly alter gabaergic currents mediated by gabaa
receptors in vitro (asproni et al., 2002; korpi et al., 1995; michel
and trudeau, 2000; squires and saederup, 1997). moreover, the
atypical antipsychotics olanzapine and clozapine are dibenzodiazepines, bearing close structural similarity to the benzodiazepines,
while the typical antipsychotic haloperidol was developed as a
gaba analogue (janssen, 1965). nonetheless, studies of
antipsychotic drug administration in healthy drug-naive animals,
whilst unable to directly model the effects of antipsychotic drugs
on the disease state, suggest that long-term drug treatment
produces the opposite effect on gabaa receptors to that
observed in schizophrenia. for example, compared with the
increase observed in schizophrenia, [3h]muscimol binding was
found to be decreased in the hippocampus and temporal regions
following at least 28 days of antipsychotic drug administration
(farnbach-pralong et al., 1998; zink et al., 2004).
our recent work has sought to determine how both [3h]
muscimol and [3h]flunitrazepam binding are affected in the same
animals following antipsychotic drug administration. preliminary
data (skilbeck et al., 2007) indicated that in the pfc [3h]
muscimol binding was not affected after 28 days of haloperidol
and olanzapine administration to healthy rats, whilst [3h]
flunitrazepam binding was increased. this work suggests that,
as in schizophrenia, antipsychotic drugs affect gabaa receptors
in a subtype-dependent fashion, but in the opposite direction to
that seen in schizophrenia. furthermore, our findings showed that
antipsychotic drug effects on gabaa receptors depend on the
period over which drugs are administered. to extend this work we
examined saturation binding curves over different drug treatment
periods (7, 14 and 28 days), allowing determination of the
saturation binding maxima (bmax) and binding affinity constant
(kd) in the pfc, thalamus and hippocampus. the purpose of this
work is to ascertain how gabaa receptors are affected by
antipsychotic drugs over different treatment periods in brain
regions involved in schizophrenia.
2. materials and methods
2.1. materials
[3h]muscimol (1 muci/mul,) and [3h]flunitrazepam (1 muci/mul)
were purchased from nen perkin-elmer (ontario, canada) and

493

had specific activities of 36.5 ci/mmol and 84.5 ci/mmol,
respectively. hydrochloric acid for ph adjustments was purchased from aps finechem (seven hills, australia).  xxxd3449xxx 
base, 3-aminopropyltriethoxy silane (silane), 2-methylbutane
(isopentane), haloperidol, sucrose and glacial acetic acid were
obtained from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo, usa). orally
administered olanzapine was obtained from the royal prince
alfred hospital pharmacy. tissue-tek-oct embedding compound was purchased from sakura finetechnical (tokyo,
japan.).
kodak biomax-ms film, autoradiography cassettes and
tritium microscale standards (2.0–110.0 nci/mg and 0.1–
15.4 nci/mg) were purchased from amersham (castle hill,
nsw, australia). phenisol developer and  xxxd3420xxx  rapid fixer
were obtained from ilford (mt waverley, nsw, australia).
2.2. animals
male sprague–dawley rats aged 9 weeks on arrival (initial
weight 250–300 g, laboratory animal services, perth,
australia) were housed in groups of three per cage under a
12 h/12 h light/dark cycle and permitted food and water ad
libitum. animals were housed under these conditions for a
minimum of one week and were then handled for an additional
week to habituate to experimenters prior to intervention. all
animal experiments were approved by the animal ethics
committee of the university of sydney.
2.3. antipsychotic drug administration
rats aged 11 weeks were randomly assigned to drug
(haloperidol, olanzapine, vehicle) and time (7, 14 or 28 day)
treatment groups (n = 6 per group). drugs were administered
daily in drinking water to account for the difference between
human and rat drug half-life (kapur et al., 2005). control rats
received the vehicle solution of 8% sucrose with acetic acid to
give ph 6. animals were weighed three times a week and these
weights were used to calculate the doses of either 1.5 mg/kg
haloperidol or 7 mg/kg olanzapine to be dissolved in the vehicle
solution for administration to the drug treatment groups. drug
doses were selected that had been shown to produce plasma
concentrations following oral administration in rats equivalent
to those therapeutically effective in humans (aravagiri et al.,
1999; volavka et al., 1992). water consumed per cage was
measured daily and mean drug intake was found to average
1.5 mg/kg/day in the haloperidol group and 6.5 mg/kg/day in
the olanzapine group.
2.4. tissue acquisition and preparation
following 7, 14 and 28 days of treatment, 6 animals from
each drug treatment group were killed between 12 and 3 pm.
carbon dioxide gas was used to anaesthetise rats prior to
decapitation. brains were removed from the cranium over ice
then immediately immersed in liquid isopentane on dry ice
(− 30°c) to ensure rapid freezing. tissue was stored at − 70°c
until sectioning. coronal sections were cut at 12 mum thickness

494

in a cryostat (damon/iec division, nedham heights, ma,
usa) maintained at − 14°c then thaw-mounted onto slides pretreated with 2% silane in acetone. three sections were mounted
per slide and slides were stored for a maximum of 12 days at
− 70°c prior to receptor binding assays.
2.5. receptor binding assays
briefly, sections were thawed for 20 min then washed twice
for 15 min in 50 mm tris–hcl buffer (ph 7.4) at room
temperature to remove endogenous ligands. sections from the
brain of each subject were incubated at 0°c in 50 mm tris–hcl
(ph 7.4) containing increasing concentrations of the either [3h]
muscimol (0–50 nm) or [3h]flunitrazepam (0–15 nm) with the
highest concentration saturating the receptor population (palacios et al., 1981; young and kuhar, 1979). using additional
sections, non-specific binding was determined by adding
100 mum bicuculline in [3h]muscimol experiments or 3 mum
diazepam in [3h]flunitrazepam experiments. for experiments
with [3h]muscimol and [3h]flunitrazepam, sections were incubated for 40 and 60 min respectively, as kinetic binding
studies show these times are sufficient for equilibrium of free
and bound ligand (palacios et al., 1981; young and kuhar,
1979). sections were rapidly washed in cold buffer to terminate
binding then dipped twice in cold distilled water to remove
salts. slides were dried at 4°c overnight then placed in autoradiography cassettes with two tritium microscale standards
(0.1–15.4 nci/mg and 2.0–110.0 nci/mg) and exposed to
kodak biomax-ms film at − 20°c for 2 or 4 weeks.
2.6. image analysis
films were scanned using a bio-rad gs-690 densitometry
scanner (california, usa) connected to a powermac 8600/200.
images were analysed using image quant v1.1 software
(molecular dynamics, itc-academic computing health science, university of virginia, usa) to determine average optical
density (sum of pixel values/number of pixels). for all brain
sections, four optical density measurements were made per area
of interest, two in each hemisphere (no differences were apparent

between hemispheres). these hemispheric values were averaged
to give a mean optical density value per region, per section, with
two sections per animal. brain regions were defined by the
experimenter circling a region of interest on the autoradiograph
following examination of cresyl violet stained slides and
reference to the rat brain atlas (paxinos and watson, 1997).
subregions were only examined when 2 independent assessors
could identify differences by eye on an image viewed at 400%.
optical density measurements were converted to concentration of radioactivity per weight of tissue (nci/mg) using the
[3h]microscales. specific binding was ascertained by subtracting non-specific binding from total binding. specific binding
data was then analysed using non-linear regression analysis and
comparing the fit of one-site (y = bmax·x/kd + x) and two-site
(y = bmax1·x/(kd1 + x) + bmax2·x/(kd2 + x)) binding models in
graphpad prism 3.0 (graph pad software, inc., san diego, ca,
usa), where x = radioligand concentration and y = nci/mg.
the equation that provided the best fit was used to determine the
bmax (maximal binding at saturation), and kd (concentration of
radioligand where half the maximal binding occurs). for all
analyses in this study the one-site model provided the best fit.
2.7. statistical analyses
statistical analyses were performed using spss 15.0 (spss,
inc., chicago, ill., usa). differences between drug treatment
groups in each of the binding parameters (bmax and kd) for each
brain region were assessed using type 3 between subjects twoway anova (analysis of variance). where the overall
anova main or interaction effects were significant, post-hoc
contrast analyses using the tukey hsd test were employed to
determine which groups were statistically different.

after 7 (control p = 0.048; haloperidol p = 0.018) and 14 days
(control p = 0.006; haloperidol p = 0.000). no significant differences in [3h]muscimol binding were observed after 28 days of
drug administration in any region. over time [3h]muscimol
bmax values changed significantly in the pfc of haloperidol (7
vs. 14 days: p = 0.050; 7 vs. 28 days: p = 0.002) and olanzapine
(bmax 7 vs. 14 days: p = 0.002; 7 vs. 28 days: p = 0.000) treated

3.2. [3h]flunitrazepam binding
table 2 provides results from experiments measuring [3h]
flunitrazepam binding, showing maximal binding (bmax) estimated as 80 ± 6% and binding affinity (kd). there was a significant drug × time interaction in the pfc (f4,49 = 2.8, p b 0.05)
where 28 days treatment with haloperidol (p = 0.048) and
olanzapine (p = 0.048) increased bmax relative to the control
group (see fig. 2) and shorter drug treatment periods (haloperidol
7 vs. 14 p = 0.000; haloperidol 7 vs. 28 p = 0.000; olanzapine 7 vs.
28 p = 0.006). in the thalamus, olanzapine treatment decreased the
bmax at both 7 and 14 days relative to controls (7 days p = 0.04.;
14 days p = 0.030) and haloperidol-treated animals (7 days
p = 0.041; 14 days p = 0.030).

increased the [3h]muscimol kd value relative to both the

consistent with this, both olanzapine (28 vs. 7 p = 0.025; 28

compared with 14 (p = 0.000) and 28 days (p = 0.000).
4. discussion
4.1. antipsychotic drug administration and [3h]muscimol
binding
results showed that the effects of antipsychotic drugs on the
total gabaa receptor density, measured by observing the
saturable binding of [3h]muscimol, vary according to the period
of antipsychotic drug administration and the region examined.
treatment with haloperidol and olanzapine initially and
transiently increased the total density of gabaa receptors
relative to controls in the pfc (see fig. 1 and table 1) and to a

lesser extent in the hippocampus (see table 1). however, after
longer treatment periods no difference was observed in any of
the regions examined. these changes in the binding site density
of the total gabaa receptor population suggest that antipsychotic drugs increase [3h]muscimol binding sites in the short
term but adaptation occurs over longer treatment periods. other
studies have similarly shown no changes in [3h]muscimol
binding in the pfc (zink et al., 2004) and reductions in hippocampal, temporal (farnbach-pralong et al., 1998; zink et al.,
2004) and striatal regions (dean et al., 2001) after long-term
treatment (at least 28 days).
the atypical antipsychotic drug olanzapine had a more
pronounced and prolonged effect on total gabaa receptor
density in subcortical regions compared with the typical antipsychotic drug haloperidol. olanzapine-treated animals showed
increased gabaa receptor expression in the thalamus and
hippocampus after 7 days, and this increase persisted in the
thalamus for up to 14 days. haloperidol-treated rats did not
differ from controls past 7 days but had a lower density of total
gabaa receptors relative to olanzapine-treated animals in the
thalamus and hippocampus  xxxd2274xxx  days and in the thalamus at
14 days. other studies have indicated larger effects of
olanzapine on gabaa receptor expression in the hippocampus
(farnbach-pralong et al., 1998), although a net decrease in
hippocampal gabaa receptors following 28 days of olanzapine administration was reported, which was not observed in the
present study. this may be explained by the fact that farnbachpralong et al. (1998) used much lower drug doses that are
unlikely to represent doses used to treat schizophrenia clinically
(zink et al., 2004; aravagiri et al., 1999).
4.2. antipsychotic drug administration and [3h]flunitrazepam
binding
shorter treatment periods had minimal effects on benzodiazepine-sensitive gabaa receptor binding density in the
present study. no changes in [3h]flunitrazepam binding were
observed in any region after 7 days, consistent with previous
work examining short drug treatment periods (fuchs et al.,
1986; gavish et al., 1988; wong et al., 1996). in the
hippocampus of haloperidol-treated rats, reduced benzodiazepine site density was observed after 14 days relative to both
control and olanzapine-treated animals, but no change was
observed after 28 days of antipsychotic drug administration in
either the hippocampus or thalamus. thus of all regions examined, [3h]flunitrazepam binding appears to be altered after a
longer treatment period only in the pfc (see fig. 2). such
delayed changes in pfc benzodiazepine binding sites on
gabaa receptors may be relevant to delayed drug effects, both
therapeutic and side-effects and suggests underlying neurotransmitter system adaptations.
4.3. effects of antipsychotic drugs on gabaa receptor
sensitivity
only minimal variations following antipsychotic drug treatment were observed in binding affinity at the orthosteric site

k.j. skilbeck et al. / progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry 32 (2008) 492–498

labelled by [3h]muscimol and the allosteric benzodiazepine site
labelled by [3 h]flunitrazepam. only olanzapine treatment
induced changes in binding affinity, with [3h]muscimol binding
affinity being altered in the hippocampus and thalamus after
shorter treatment periods, and [ 3 h]flunitrazepam binding
affinity being altered in both the hippocampus and pfc after
longer drug administration. coupled with the observed changes
in binding site density reported here, variations in binding
affinity may represent changes in gabaa receptor composition, as different gabaa receptor subtypes have varying
pharmacological sensitivities (ebert et al., 1994; luddens et al.,
1991; pritchett et al., 1989). since only olanzapine treatment
affected binding affinity in any significant way, and had a more
pronounced effect on gabaa receptor expression in general,
the changes we observed may represent changes in endogenous
gabaa receptor mediators. this is because atypical antipsychotic drugs, and olanzapine in particular, have been shown to
increase brain concentrations of endogenous neurosteroid
modulators of gabaa receptors (barbaccia et al., 2001;
marx et al., 2000; nechmad et al., 2003). thus augmentation
of gabaergic tone through neurosteroid enhancement may be
involved in antipsychotic effects exerted by olanzapine, (marx
et al., 2000; ugale et al., 2004).

5. conclusions
over the 28 days of antipsychotic drug administration,
haloperidol and olanzapine altered the density of gabaa
receptor binding sites in the pfc, hippocampus and thalamus.
in general, changes in binding varied according to the period
of antipsychotic drug administration, the brain region
examined, the type of antipsychotic drug that was administered and the gabaa receptor subtype that was examined.
this variation in gabaa receptor expression demonstrates
plasticity of the gabaa receptors in the early phases of
antipsychotic drug treatment. total gabaa receptor binding
increased with short-term antipsychotic drug administration but returned to baseline levels after 28 days. however,
benzodiazepine-sensitive binding was not affected in any
region until 28 days when there was an increase in the binding
site density (bmax) for both olanzapine and haloperidol
treatment groups in the pfc. our findings confirm that the
subset of gabaa receptors sensitive to benzodiazepines are
regulated differently from other gabaa receptor subtypes
following antipsychotic drug administration, in a time-and
brain region-dependent fashion.

4.4. general discussion
since all measurements of [3h]muscimol and [3h]flunitrazepam were in the same animals in the current study, it appears
that in the prefrontal cortex, benzodiazepine-sensitive gabaa
receptors are differentially regulated from other gabaa
receptors following antipsychotic drug administration. changes
in the number of binding sites for the different radioligands
labelling the same macromolecular complex (the gabaa
receptor) suggest alterations in gabaa receptor subunit composition occur following antipsychotic drug administration.
thus, antipsychotic drugs appear to alter the proportion of
different protein subunits expressed without altering the net
number of gabaa receptors expressed. in this way, antipsychotics seem to cause a “reshuffling” of gabaa receptor
subunits so that there is a greater proportion of receptors
available for benzodiazepines. this differential regulation of
gabaa receptor subtypes is observed in the pfc and hippocampus of subjects with schizophrenia, however the changes
occur in the opposite direction, where no change or a decrease
in [3h]flunitrazepam binding is seen (benes, 1997; reynolds
and stroud, 1993; squires et al., 1993). interestingly, in schizophrenia certain brain regions such as the superior temporal
gyrus do not show such differential regulation in [3h]muscimol
and [3h]flunitrazepam binding (deng and huang, 2006; kiuchi
et al., 1989), thus the effects of antipsychotic drugs on gabaa
receptors in the superior temporal gyrus requires examination.
furthermore, whilst the present study of healthy rats with short
post-mortem delay in tissue acquisition is limited in the extent
to which it may be compared with post-mortem studies of
schizophrenic tissue, future work may address if antipsychotic
drug administration or withdrawal counteracts gabaa receptor
changes in schizophrenia and animal models of psychosis.
