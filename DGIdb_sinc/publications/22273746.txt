anabolic androgenic steroids (aas) are testosterone derivatives
used either clinically, in elite sports, or for body shaping with the
goal to increase muscle size and strength. clinically developed
compounds and nonclinically tested designer steroids often
marketed as food supplements are widely used. despite the
considerable evidence for various adverse effects of aas use, the
underlying molecular mechanisms are insufficiently understood.
here, we investigated whether some aas, as a result of a lack of
target selectivity, might inhibit 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
2 (11b- xxxg1085xxx )–dependent inactivation of glucocorticoids. using
recombinant human 11b- xxxg1085xxx , we observed inhibitory effects for
several aas. whereas  xxxd2814xxx , oxymesterone,  xxxd1806xxx , and
testosterone showed medium inhibitory potential,  xxxd2136xxx 
was a potent inhibitor of human 11b- xxxg1085xxx  (half-maximal
inhibitory concentration [ic50] of 60–100nm in cell lysates; ic50
of 160nm in intact sw-620, and 530nm in mcf-7 cells). measurements with rat kidney microsomes and lysates of cells expressing
recombinant mouse 11b- xxxg1085xxx  revealed much weaker inhibition by
the aas tested, indicating that the adverse effects of
aas-dependent 11b- xxxg1085xxx  inhibition cannot be investigated in
rats and mice. furthermore, we provide evidence that  xxxd2136xxx  is metabolized to 11-oxofluoxymesterone by human
11b- xxxg1085xxx . structural modeling revealed similar binding modes
for  xxxd2136xxx  and cortisol, supporting a competitive mode of
inhibition of 11b- xxxg1085xxx –dependent cortisol oxidation by this aas.
no direct modulation of  xxxg1602xxx  (mr) function
was observed. thus, 11b- xxxg1085xxx  inhibition by  xxxd2136xxx  may
cause cortisol-induced mr activation, thereby leading to electrolyte
disturbances and contributing to the development of hypertension
and cardiovascular disease.
key words: anabolic androgenic steroid;  xxxd2136xxx ;
testosterone; 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; hypertension;
glucocorticoid; cardiovascular disease.

the misuse of anabolic androgenic steroids (aas) represents
a serious issue both in sports and in specific subsets of the
population (basaria, 2010). aas are not only used as ergogenic
drugs by athletes to enhance performance during competition but
also for bodybuilding and for improving body image. estimates
suggested that the lifetime prevalence of aas use in the united
states is about 3% and that up to 6% of high school boys and 2%
of girls use aas (basaria, 2010; buckley et al., 1988; hall,
2005; kanayama et al., 2009; yesalis et al., 1997). in addition to
endogenously occurring steroids and synthetic aas developed
for clinical applications such as muscle wasting in human
immunodeficiency virus infection and aging, an increasing
number of designer steroids that have never been clinically tested
often are present in dietary supplements, mostly without proper
labeling (kuhn, 2002; parr and schanzer, 2010).
the use of aas has been associated with a series of adverse
effects, including hepatotoxicity, psychological disturbances,
virilization, suppressed spermatogenesis, gynecomastia, as well
as premature mortality mainly as a result of cardiovascular
complications (handelsman, 2011; parssinen et al., 2000). aas
exert direct effects on cardiomyocytes and vascular cells and
indirect effects by decreasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
and leading to early abnormalities in blood clotting factors (ansell
et al., 1993; calof et al., 2005; glazer, 1991). an impaired
systolic and diastolic function has been directly associated with
the duration and dose of aas use in a recent study in power
athletes (d’andrea et al., 2007). furthermore, aas use has been
associated with increased fluid retention and elevated blood
pressure (sullivan et al., 1998). despite the recognition of the
serious adverse cardiovascular effects of aas misuse, the
underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown.
impaired corticosteroid metabolism and activation of
mineralocorticoid receptors (mr) have been associated with

materials and methods
materials. methenolone was purchased from cerilliant corporation (round
rock, tx),  xxxd2152xxx  from lpb instituto farmaceutico s.p.a. (cinisello,
milano, italy), and other steroids from the national analytical reference
laboratory (pymble, australia) and from steraloids (newport, ri). the reagents
and solvents used were of analytical and high performance liquid chromatography
grade. [1,2,6,7-3h]-cortisol was purchased from perkinelmer (waltham, ma). cell
culture media were purchased from invitrogen (carlsbad, ca); all other chemicals
were from fluka ag (buchs, switzerland) of the highest grade available.
cell culture. hek-293 cells stably transfected with human 11b- xxxg1085xxx 
(schweizer et al., 2003), human sw-620 colon carcinoma cells, and human
mcf-7 breast cancer cells were cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s
medium (dmem) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4.5 g/l glucose,

50 u/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2mm glutamine, and 1mm 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid, ph 7.4.
determination of inhibition of human and mouse 11b- xxxg1085xxx  using cell
lysates. the conversion of cortisol to cortisone by 11b- xxxg1085xxx  was measured
as described previously (gaware et al., 2011). briefly, lysates of stably
transfected hek-293 cells were incubated for 10 min (human 11b- xxxg1085xxx ) or
20 min (mouse 11b- xxxg1085xxx ) at 37°c in a total volume of 22 ll of ts2 buffer
(100mm nacl, 1mm ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid [egta], 1mm edta,
1mm mgcl2, 250mm sucrose, and 20mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4) containing a final
concentration of 200nm cortisol, of which 10% was radiolabeled, 500lm
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nadþ), and vehicle or inhibitor at the
desired concentration. reactions were terminated by adding methanol
containing 2mm unlabeled cortisol and cortisone, followed by separation of
steroids by thin-layer chromatography (tlc) and analysis by scintillation
counting. in addition, the inhibition of the conversion of cortisol to cortisone
and  xxxd2136xxx  to 11-oxofluoxymesterone by human 11b- xxxg1085xxx  in cell
lysates was assessed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (for lc-ms
method, see below). lysates of hek-293 cells stably expressing human 11bhsd2 were incubated for 10 min at 37°c in a total volume of 500 ll at a final
concentration of 200nm cortisol, 500lm nadþ, and various concentrations of
 xxxd2136xxx . to assess inhibition of  xxxd2136xxx  oxidation, lysates
were incubated for 1 h at 37°c with 500nm  xxxd2136xxx  and various
concentrations of cortisol. reactions were stopped by shock freezing in a dry
ice-ethanol bath. stock solutions of all inhibitors were prepared in
dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) or methanol. further dilutions were prepared prior
to use in ts2 buffer to yield final concentrations between 0.6nm and 10lm.
determination of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  inhibition using rat kidney microsomes. rat kidney microsomes were prepared basically as described earlier
(senesi et al., 2010). briefly, the kidneys of male sprague dawley rats were
homogenized, and the microsomal fraction was isolated by fractional centrifugation. the microsomes were resuspended at a protein concentration of 1 mg protein/
ml of buffer containing 100mm nacl, 1mm egta, 1mm edta, 1mm mgcl2,
250mm sucrose and 20mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4, and frozen at 70°c. for 11bhsd2 activity measurements, microsomes at a final protein amount of 10 lg per
reaction were incubated for 10 min at 37°c as described above for cell lysates.
determination of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  inhibition in intact sw-620 and mcf-7
cells. 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity in intact sw-620 cells was measured as described
earlier (gaware et al., 2011). briefly, 100,000 cells per well of a 96-well plate
were incubated in 50 ll steroid-free dmem containing vehicle or inhibitor at
the desired concentration, 10 nci radiolabeled cortisol and 50nm unlabeled
cortisol. sw-620 and mcf-7 cells were incubated for 2 and 4 h, respectively, at
37°c, followed by separation of steroids by tlc and scintillation counting.
transactivation assay. hek-293 cells (200,000 cells per well) were seeded
in poly-l-lysine–coated 24-well plates, incubated for 16 h, and transfected using
calcium phosphate precipitation with pmmtv-lacz b-galactosidase reporter
(0.20 lg/well), pcmv-luc luciferase transfection control (0.04 lg/well), and
human recombinant mr (0.35 lg/well). cells were washed twice with dmem
6 h posttransfection, followed by incubation for another 18 h to allow sufficient
expression. cells were then washed once with steroid- and serum-free dmem
(dmemsf) and cultivated at least 3 h at 37°c. the culture medium was replaced
with fresh dmemsf containing dmso (0.05%) or aldosterone (10nm) in the
presence or absence of  xxxd2136xxx  (1lm). after incubation for 24 h, cells
were washed once with pbs and lysed with 60 ll lysis buffer of the tropix kit
(applied biosystems, foster city, ca) supplemented with 0.5mm dithiothreitol.
lysed samples were frozen at 80°c for at least 20 min. lysates (20 ll) were
analyzed for b-galactosidase activity using the tropix kit. luciferase activity was
analyzed in 20 ll samples using a luciferin solution (kratschmar et al., 2011).
measurement of  xxxd2136xxx  metabolism by lc-ms. lysates of
untransfected hek-293 cells and hek-293 cells stably expressing human
11b- xxxg1085xxx  were incubated for 1 h at 37°c in a total volume of 500 ll at a final
concentration of 1lm  xxxd2136xxx  or cortisol and 500lm nadþ. the
reactions were stopped by shock freezing using a dry ice-ethanol bath.

cardiovascular disease (briet and schiffrin, 2010; hadoke et al.,
2009; lastra et al., 2010). two clinical hallmark studies
supplementing the standard therapy (angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitor, loop diuretic, and digoxin) with the mr
antagonists spironolactone (randomized  xxxd3238xxx  evaluation
study, pitt et al., 1999) or  xxxd2010xxx  ( xxxd2010xxx  post-acute
myocardial infarction heart failure efficacy and survival study,
pitt et al., 2003b) revealed significantly reduced mortality in
patients with myocardial infarction. moreover, in patients with
essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (4e-left
ventricular hypertrophy study, pitt et al., 2003a), the administration of the mr antagonist  xxxd2010xxx  lowered blood pressure and
reduced left ventricular hypertrophy. importantly, aldosterone
levels were low in these patients, suggesting activation of mr by
glucocorticoids, alternative ligands, or ligand-independent receptor
activation (frey et al., 2004; odermatt and atanasov, 2009).
glucocorticoid-induced mr activation is especially relevant
in situations of impaired activity of 11b-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase 2 (11b- xxxg1085xxx ), which converts active 11bhydroxyglucocorticoids (cortisol and corticosterone) into their
inactive 11-keto forms (cortisone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone) (frey et al., 2004; odermatt and kratschmar, 2012). in
addition to distal colon and renal cortical collecting ducts,
coexpression of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  and mr has been reported in the
atria and the ventricles of the heart and in endothelial cells and
vascular smooth muscle cells of the aorta (caprio et al., 2008;
klusonova et al., 2009; naray-fejes-toth and fejes-toth,
2007). inhibition of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  is expected to cause excessive
cortisol-induced mr activation in these tissues. the impact of
impaired 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity has been investigated in  xxxg177xxx  (/)/11b- xxxg1085xxx  (/) double knockout mice
where the loss of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  stimulates inflammation and
strikingly promotes atherosclerosis in an mr-dependent
manner (deuchar et al., 2011). in humans, genetic defects in
the gene encoding 11b- xxxg1085xxx  result in cortisol-induced mr
activation and severe hypertension, ultimately leading to death
by cardiovascular complications (ferrari, 2010).
in the present study, we tested the hypothesis that some
widely used aas compounds might inhibit 11b- xxxg1085xxx  and/or
directly modulate mr activity.

 xxxd2136xxx  inhibits 11b- xxxg1085xxx 

determination of the binding mode of steroids in 11b- xxxg1085xxx  by molecular
modeling. the 2d structures of  xxxd2136xxx , testosterone, cortisone, and
cortisol were generated using chembiodraw ultra 12.0 (cambridgesoft, u.k.,
1986–2009, www.cambridgesoft.com). two-dimensional structures were transformed into 3d using corina (molecular networks gmbh, erlangen,
germany). these four compounds were docked into the previously generated
homology model of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  (gaware et al., 2011) using gold (jones et al.,
1997; verdonk et al., 2003). the binding site was defined by a 10 å sphere with
the hydroxyl group of tyr232 in the center. to optimize the ligand orientation,
two protein hydrogen bond constraints were defined: one to the catalytically
active tyr232 and the second one to tyr226. during the docking, the protein was
handled as rigid and ligands as flexible. the ligand flexibility was increased by
allowing the ring corner to flip. goldscore was used as a scoring function, and 10
docking solutions for each ligand were calculated. atom types for the protein as
well as for the ligands were automatically determined by the program.
ligandscout (wolber and langer, 2005) was used for visualizing the docking
results and for the analysis of the protein-ligand interactions.

inhibition of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  by anabolic androgenic steroids
measured in cell lysates
in order to test the hypothesis that aas might cause adverse
effects by disrupting corticosteroid hormone action, we tested

several frequently used aas for potential inhibition of the 11bhsd2–dependent conversion of cortisol to cortisone as well as
for their impact on mr transactivation. the activity of human
11b- xxxg1085xxx  was assessed using lysates of stably transfected
hek-293 cells and by determining the conversion of radiolabeled cortisol to cortisone. at a high concentration (10lm),
only norbolethone and methenolone did not have any inhibitory
effect (table 1). dehydroepiandrosterone, mesterolone, and
 xxxd2152xxx  showed weak inhibitory effects with estimated
half-maximal inhibitory concentration (ic50) values of 10lm or
higher. for the compounds that showed less than 40% remaining
activity at this concentration, ic50 values were determined. this
revealed potent inhibition by the 11b-hydroxylated steroid
 xxxd2136xxx  with ic50 of 60 ± 27nm and medium inhibitory
effects for testosterone (fig. 1a), oxymesterone,  xxxd1806xxx , and
 xxxd2814xxx . the inhibition of 11b- xxxg1085xxx –mediated cortisol
oxidation by  xxxd2136xxx  was confirmed in an assay using
unlabeled cortisol and quantification of the product cortisone by
lc-ms. a slightly higher ic50 value of 100 ± 28nm was
obtained (data not shown).
adverse effects are usually studied in a next step in
rodents. in preparing for animal studies, we tested whether
 xxxd2136xxx  would inhibit rat and mouse 11b- xxxg1085xxx 
in vitro. measurements with rat kidney microsomes revealed
an approximately 80-fold lower inhibitory potential with an
ic50 of 4.9 ± 0.8lm (fig. 1b). similarly, an ic50 of 5.4 ±
0.4lm was obtained for  xxxd2136xxx  inhibition of 11bhsd2 using lysates of hek-293 cells stably expressing the
mouse enzyme (fig. 1c). testosterone was about 10-fold less
potent toward the rat and the mouse enzymes with ic50 of
14.9 ± 4.3 and 15.3 ± 3.5lm, respectively. the weak

after thawing, samples were centrifuged at 4°c for 10 min at 500 3 g and
supernatants transferred onto a solid phase extraction column (oasis hbl 1 cc
[30 mg] waters wat094225) preconditioned with 1 ml of methanol and 1 ml
of distilled water. after washing twice with 1 ml of water, steroids were eluted
by twice adding 1 ml of methanol. the combined eluate was evaporated to
dryness and reconstituted with 100 ll of methanol.
steroids were resolved on an atlantis t3 (3 lm, 2.1 3 150 mm) column
(waters, milford, ma) at 30°c using an agilent model 1200 infinity series
chromatograph (agilent technologies, basel, switzerland). the mobile phase
consisted of solvent a (0.1%  xxxd2154xxx  in water) and solvent b (0.1% formic
acid in acetonitrile). to separate  xxxd2136xxx  and 11-oxofluoxymesterone,
a linear gradient starting from 55% solvent a and 45% solvent b to 5% solvent
a and 95% solvent b from 0 to 12 min was used. to separate cortisol and
cortisone, a linear gradient starting from 85% solvent a and 15% solvent b to
60% solvent a and 40% solvent b from 0 to 15 min was used. the flow rate
was maintained at 0.4 ml/min.
the lc was interfaced to an agilent 6490 triple quad mass spectrometer (ms).
the ms was operated in atmospheric pressure electrospray positive ionization
mode, with nebulizer pressure and nebulizer gas flow rate of 45 psi and 10 l/h,
respectively, a source temperature of 350°c and capillary and cone voltage of 4
kw and 190 v, respectively. data acquisition was performed by mass hunter
workstation (version b01.04). metabolites were identified by comparing their
retention time and mass to charge ratio (m/z) with those of authentic standards.
qualitative determination of steroids was performed by selected positive
ionization multiple reaction monitoring.  xxxd2136xxx  (m/z 337.1) and
11-oxofluoxymesterone (m/z 335.1) eluted at 9.1 and 9.7 min, respectively. for
the quantitative determination of  xxxd2136xxx , prednisolone (m/z 361.1,
retention time 7.3 min) was used as internal standard. metabolites were quantified
from calibration curves of the ratio of the peak area of the authentic
 xxxd2136xxx  standard and the internal prednisolone standard incubated with
lysates of untransfected hek-293 cells at a total protein concentration identical to
that of the experimental setting and plotted against the concentration of authentic
standards (normalization to the internal standard). a reference standard for
11-oxofluoxymesterone was not available and needs to be synthesized for
confirmation of the structure and exact quantification. cortisone (precursor and
product ion at m/z 361 and 163) and cortisol (precursor and product ion at m/z
363 and 121) eluted at 8.5 and 8.9 min, respectively.

inhibitory effects of  xxxd2136xxx  and testosterone on the
rodent 11b- xxxg1085xxx  enzymes make it unlikely to study the
adverse effects in these species, and animal experiments were
not performed.
inhibition of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  in intact sw-620 and mcf-7 cells
the effect of  xxxd2136xxx  on 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity was
next determined in intact cells. two distinct cell models,
human colon carcinoma sw-620 cells and human breast
cancer mcf-7 cells with relatively high endogenous expression of the enzyme were applied. cell models with lower
expression may not be suitable to determine direct effects
on enzyme activity due to interference with altered gene
expression.  xxxd2136xxx  potently inhibited 11b- xxxg1085xxx  in
a concentration-dependent manner with ic50 of 160 ± 10nm
in sw-620 cells and ic50 of 530 ± 70nm in mcf-7 cells
(fig. 2). although the known reference compound  xxxd2221xxx  also showed potent inhibition, testosterone did
not significantly inhibit 11b- xxxg1085xxx  at concentrations up to
10lm in intact sw-620 or mcf-7 cells.

 xxxd2136xxx  does not directly modulate mr activation
to see whether  xxxd2136xxx  might directly modulate mr
activity, transactivation assays in hek-293 cells transiently
expressing mr and a galactosidase reporter under the control of
the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter were performed. cells
were incubated with 1lm of  xxxd2136xxx  alone or together
with 10nm aldosterone. the reporter gene response was
indistinguishable if cells were treated with either aldosterone
alone or in combination with  xxxd2136xxx  (fig. 3).
furthermore, basal receptor activity measured by dmso
treatment (0.05%) was not changed by  xxxd2136xxx .
similarly, the other tested aas (see table 1) did not activate
or antagonize mr function, indicating that these steroids have no
direct effect on the receptor.
 xxxd2136xxx  is metabolized by 11b- xxxg1085xxx 
because  xxxd2136xxx  possesses an 11b-hydroxyl group,
we hypothesized that this steroid may be a substrate and
therefore competitively inhibit the enzyme. therefore, we
established an lc-ms–based method using the multiple

of 11b- xxxg1085xxx , were incubated for 2 and 4 h, respectively, with 50nm of radiolabeled cortisol and increasing concentrations of  xxxd2136xxx . values were
normalized to the activity observed in the presence of vehicle (0.1% dmso). data represent mean ± sd from three independent experiments.

fig. 1. inhibition of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity by  xxxd2136xxx  measured in cell lysates. (a) lysates of hek-293 cells stably expressing recombinant human
11b- xxxg1085xxx  were incubated for 10 min at 37°c with 50nm of radiolabeled cortisol and increasing concentrations of  xxxd2136xxx  (squares) or testosterone
(circles), followed by determination of cortisone formation. similarly, inhibition by  xxxd2136xxx  and testosterone was measured using rat kidney microsomes
(b) and lysates of hek-293 cells stably expressing mouse 11b- xxxg1085xxx  (c). values were normalized to the activity observed in the presence of vehicle (0.1%
dmso). data represent mean ± sd from three independent experiments.

 xxxd2136xxx  inhibits 11b- xxxg1085xxx 

reaction monitoring mode for the qualitative and quantitative
determination of  xxxd2136xxx  (m/z 337.1) and its metabolite
11-oxofluoxymesterone (m/z 335.1) (see materials and methods
section).  xxxd2136xxx  and 11-oxofluoxymesterone were
clearly separated with retention times of 9.1 and 9.7 min,
respectively (fig. 4). similarly, conditions were established to
separate and quantify cortisol (m/z 363, retention time 8.5 min)
and cortisone (m/z 361, retention time 8.9 min). upon incubation
for 1 h with lysates of hek-293 cells stably expressing
11b- xxxg1085xxx , approximately 50% of the supplied  xxxd2136xxx 
(1lm) was converted. in comparison, under the same conditions,
approximately 80% of cortisol was converted. no conversion
was observed when lysates of untransfected hek-293 cells were
used. thus, although both steroids are substrates of 11b- xxxg1085xxx 
(fig. 5), the enzyme more efficiently oxidizes cortisol.
to further support the hypothesis that  xxxd2136xxx  and
cortisol bind to and are metabolized by 11b- xxxg1085xxx , we studied
the impact of cortisol on the conversion of  xxxd2136xxx  (at
a final concentration of 500nm) to 11-oxofluoxymesterone in
cell lysates. a concentration-dependent inhibition with an ic50
of 730 ± 190nm was obtained (data not shown).

residue tyr232, close to the catalytic triad ser219-tyr232lys236 (fig. 6a). the binding interactions of each compound
were investigated in detail to explain the difference in their
activities. the automatically created pharmacophoric interaction pattern showed different hydrogen-bonding patterns for

discussion

in this study, we analyzed several well-known and widely
used aas for their potential to inhibit 11b- xxxg1085xxx  and
identified  xxxd2136xxx  as a potent inhibitor. the ic50
values of 60–100nm in cell lysates and 160 and 530nm
measured in intact sw-620 and mcf-7 cells, respectively, are
in a comparable range with the inhibitory potential of
 xxxd2221xxx , which has been demonstrated in both
animals and humans to inhibit 11b- xxxg1085xxx  and cause
glucocorticoid-mediated mr activation, potassium excretion,
sodium and water retention, and increased blood pressure
(ferrari, 2010; ferrari et al., 2001; serra et al., 2002). as
shown for  xxxd2136xxx  in the present study, glycyrrhetinic
acid also does not directly modulate mr function
but competitively inhibits 11b- xxxg1085xxx , thereby leading to
glucocorticoid-mediated mr activation.
oral  xxxd2136xxx , which is marketed as  xxxd2136xxx  in the
united states for the treatment of hypogonadism in men and of
certain hormone-dependent mammary tumors in women, can
exacerbate health states where edema plays important
roles, such as congestive heart failure (as described in the
package leaflet, http://www.pfizer.com/files/products/uspi_
 xxxd2136xxx .pdf). a possible mechanistic explanation for these
warnings concerning fluid retention states includes the
involvement of mr activation. following oral administration,
 xxxd2136xxx  is rapidly metabolized in the liver. the
adverse effects described above can be expected to be much
more pronounced upon intravenous application of the drug,
which is the preferred route of administration in sports and
bodybuilding.
inhibition of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  in the renal distal tubules and cortical
collecting ducts results in glucocorticoid-induced mr activation
with subsequently increased activities of naþ/kþ-atpases at the

basolateral membrane and of naþ channels (enac) on the apical
membrane of epithelial cells, resulting in potassium excretion
and sodium and water retention (ferrari, 2010). in the
vasculature, decreased 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity leads to vasoconstriction and elevated blood pressure, probably by a mechanism
involving the activation of  xxxg1601xxx  rather than
mr (goodwin et al., 2008). furthermore, inhibition of 11bhsd2 in vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells of
the heart may lead to paracrine activation of mr in
cardiomyocytes. in a recent study using transgenic mice,
deuchar et al. (2011) showed that the ablation of 11b- xxxg1085xxx 
in  xxxg177xxx  knockout mice aggravated the progression of
atherosclerosis by a mechanism involving mr activation and
stimulation of inflammation in the vascular endothelium. the use
of aas has been associated with reduced levels of high-density
lipoproteins and an increased ratio of low-density lipoproteins to
high-density lipoproteins (glazer, 1991; thompson et al., 1989).
thus, aas that inhibit 11b- xxxg1085xxx , like  xxxd2136xxx , may
be especially prone to cause adverse cardiovascular effects.
regarding the inhibitory mechanism, both the 3d structural
modeling and the fact that 11b- xxxg1085xxx  can metabolize
 xxxd2136xxx  to 11-oxofluoxymesterone support a competitive inhibition of cortisol oxidation. the 11b-hydroxyl on
 xxxd2136xxx  has important stabilizing interactions that are
absent in testosterone and other aas. interestingly,  xxxd2152xxx  also has an 11b-hydroxyl but is a very weak 11b- xxxg1085xxx 
inhibitor, probably as a result of the methyl group in ring-a,
which leads to steric hindrance and prevents optimal
stabilization in the binding pocket. although 11b- xxxg1085xxx  can
oxidize  xxxd2136xxx  at position 11, this reaction represents
a minor contribution to the overall metabolism of this steroid
(pozo et al., 2008). compared with cortisol,  xxxd2136xxx 
was approximately three to five times less efficiently converted
to its 11-oxo form, resembling the conversion of dexamethasone, which also has a fluor atom at position 9 (rebuffat et al.,
2004). a reference compound needs to be synthesized to test
whether 11b- xxxg1085xxx  might be able to reduce 11-oxofluoxymesterone as previously observed for 11-oxodexamethasone. this,
together with the extensive hepatic metabolism, would explain
why 11-oxo derivatives of  xxxd2136xxx  are minor
metabolites of  xxxd2136xxx  in human urine (pozo et al.,
2008).
the potent inhibition of human but not rat and mouse
11b- xxxg1085xxx  by  xxxd2136xxx  emphasizes the importance to
assess species-specific differences using recombinant enzymes
and enzyme preparations from native tissues before conducting
animal studies, both from an ethical point of view and to save
resources. clinical studies will need to investigate the potential
of  xxxd2136xxx  to inhibit 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity in vivo. this
can be achieved by measuring its impact on the ratio of
11b-hydroxy- to 11-oxoglucocorticoids in plasma and their
corresponding tetrahydro metabolites in 24-h urine samples
and by examining the patients for the presence of low-renin and
low-aldosterone hypertension.

and the 11-hydroxy group of  xxxd2136xxx  indicated that this
molecule can be transformed into its 11-keto form by the enzyme.
in fact, biological data showed that  xxxd2136xxx  is a substrate
of 11b- xxxg1085xxx , but with a lower conversion rate than cortisol. this
lower conversion rate leads to a competitive inhibition of 11bhsd2 by  xxxd2136xxx .
interestingly, testosterone was predicted to adapt a different
binding mode compared with the other three compounds.
it was located in the same area as the others; however, it had
a flipped binding mode. whereas cortisol, cortisone, and
 xxxd2136xxx  had their 3-keto groups pointing toward
tyr226, the 3-keto group of testosterone superimposed onto
position 17 of the other steroids. no other hydrogen bond
between testosterone and the protein was observed. this
kind of binding mode as well as fewer hydrogen bonds
and hydrophobic interactions with the protein could be
an explanation for the weaker 11b- xxxg1085xxx  inhibition of
testosterone.
