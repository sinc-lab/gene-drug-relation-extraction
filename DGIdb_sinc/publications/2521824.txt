abstract: this report describes the first observation of a direct mitogenic
effect of
androgens on isolated osteoblastic cells in serum-free culture. [3h]thymidine
incorporation into dna and cell counts were used as measures of cell proliferation. the
percentage of cells that stained for alkaline phosphatase was used as a measure of
differentiation. dihydrotestosterone (dht) enhanced mouse osteoblastic
cell proliferation

maximally active  xxxd1891xxx ~9 m. dht also stimulated proliferation in human osteoblast cell
cultures and in cultures of the human osteosarcoma cell line, te89. testosterone,
 xxxd2136xxx  (a synthetic androgenic steroid) and methenolone (an anabolic steroid)
were also mitogenic in the mouse bone cell system. the mitogenic effect of dht on bone
cells was inhibited by antiandrogens (hydroxyflutamide and  xxxd1786xxx ) which
compete for binding to the  xxxg183xxx . in addition to effects on cell
dht increased the percentage of alkaline phosphatase (alp) positive
proliferation,
cells in all three bone cell systems tested, and this effect
was inhibited by
antiandrogens. we conclude that androgens can stimulate human and murine osteoblastic
cell proliferation in vitro, and induce expression of the osteoblast-line differentiation
marker alp, presumably by an  xxxg183xxx  mediated mechanism.

the number of alp+ stained cells. the results of
these studies indicate that the percentage of alp+
staining as well as the total number of murine bone
cells was increased by dht treatment (table 2 ) .
thus, dht stimulated differentiation as measured by
the percentage of alp+ cells.

vary among different species (11). we determined

antiandrogens
(which

androgens for the  xxxg183xxx  [12]) were
added to the human bone cell cultures, either alone
or in combination with
an androgen. we used

antiandrogen.

bone cells to proliferate and differentiate (as
measured by alp activity). these observations
suggest that the increase in skeletal mass in
androgen treated subjects could be due to a direct
effect of androgens on bone formation. in some
tissues testosterone can be converted to estrogens
which are thought to play a role in controlling
bone
mass
(13). our
observation
that
 xxxd2136xxx , a synthetic androgen, and dht,
both of which can not be metabolized to estrogens,
increased mouse bone cell proliferation argues
against the possibility
that testosterone was
converted to estrogens by the bone cells and
exerted its effect through the estrogen receptors
which are present in human bone cells (14,15).

furthermore, testosterone, which has been
previously shown to bind with a lower affinity than
dht to the  xxxg183xxx  (16), and dht were
almost
equipotent
in
stimulating
cell

raising the possibility that
testosterone may be converted into dht in bone
cells prior to stimulating cell proliferation. in
all three osteoblastic cell systems examined, the
relative increase in the number of alp* cells was
greater than that of alp" cells. there are several

mechanisms by which this could have occurred,
including the possibility that alp+ cells might be
more sensitive than alp" cells to mitogenic
stimulation by androgens or that androgens may have
converted alp" cells to alp+ cells. although the
mechanism for the increase in alp* cells is not
understood, it is clear that androgens increased
the number of differentiated bone cells.
since our data indicate that androgens can have
direct effects on cells of the osteoblast-lineage
in vitro, we reasoned that these bone cells contain
androgen receptors.  xxxg183xxx  specific
antiandrogens inhibited the mitogenic effects of

increase the number of alp* human
bone cells
(fig.3b), and blocked the mitogenic effects of
androgens on mouse bone cells (data not shown).
these findings suggest that human (and mouse) bone
cells have androgen receptors, although this
possibility must be confirmed by direct measurement
of androgen receptors.
