molecular determinants of dofetilide block of
herg k1 channels
eckhard ficker, wolfgang jarolimek, johann kiehn, arnd baumann, arthur m. brown
abstract—the human ether-a-go-go–related gene (herg) encodes a k1 channel with biophysical properties nearly
identical to the rapid component of the cardiac delayed rectifier k1 current (ikr). herg/ikr channels are a prime target
for the pharmacological management of arrhythmias and are selectively blocked by class iii antiarrhythmic methanesulfonanilide drugs, such as dofetilide, e4031, and mk-499, at submicromolar concentrations. by contrast, the closely related
bovine ether-a-go-go channel (beag) is 100-fold less sensitive to dofetilide. to identify the molecular determinants for
dofetilide block, we first engineered chimeras between herg and beag and then used site-directed mutagenesis to
localize single amino acid residues responsible for block. using constructs heterologously expressed in xenopus oocytes, we
found that transplantation of the s5-s6 linker from beag into herg removed high-affinity block by dofetilide. a point
mutation in the s5-s6 linker region, herg s620t, abolished high-affinity block and interfered with c-type inactivation.
thus, our results indicate that important determinants of dofetilide binding are localized to the pore region of herg.
since the loss of high-affinity drug binding was always correlated with a loss of c-type inactivation, it is possible that the
changes observed in drug binding are due to indirect allosteric modifications in the structure of the channel protein and
not to the direct interaction of dofetilide with the respective mutated site chains. however, the chimeric approach was not
able to identify domains outside the s5-s6 linker region of the herg channel as putative candidates involved in drug
binding. moreover, the reverse mutation beag t432s increased the affinity of beag k1 channels for dofetilide, whereas
c-type inactivation could not be recovered. thus, the serine in position herg 620 may participate directly in dofetilide
binding; however, an intact c-type inactivation process seems to be crucial for high-affinity drug binding. (circ res.

t

he human ether-a-go-go–related gene, herg, encodes a
k1 channel with biophysical properties nearly identical to
the rapid component of ikr.1 the electrophysiological fingerprint of both ikr and herg currents is dominated by slow
current activation at negative membrane potentials, large
long-lasting tail currents on repolarization, modulation of
current amplitudes by external k1 ions, and a limited amount
of outward current. this strong inward rectification is unusual
for voltage-activated k1 currents and has been attributed to a
fast c-type inactivation mechanism.2–5 in humans, ikr plays a
central role in repolarization of the myocardium and termination of individual heartbeats. of all class iii antiarrhythmic
agents, ikr is blocked with highest affinity and selectivity by
methanesulfonanilides, such as e-4031, ibutilide, and dofetilide.6 –9 heterologously expressed herg currents share these
pharmacological properties with ikr,10 and open-channel block
by nanomolar concentrations of methanesulfonanilides (dofetilide and mk-499) has been demonstrated.11–13

ikr/herg represents a unique target for the pharmacological management of arrhythmias. the pharmacological potential of class iii antiarrhythmic drugs, however, is limited by
their tendency to produce an excessive prolongation of action
potentials, which can cause acquired long qt syndrome and
sudden cardiac death. interestingly, hereditary long qt syndrome has been linked to mutations in herg that produce
loss of function or dominant-negative suppression of ikr.14
in the present study, we used dofetilide to probe the
structural requirements governing highly selective methanesulfonanilide block of herg. the closely related beag channel
is 100-fold less sensitive to dofetilide and was used to engineer
chms with herg. we analyzed herg/beag chms to
determine which protein domain is responsible for highaffinity block by dofetilide. we found that with transplantation
of the s5-s6 linker from beag into herg, the high-affinity
block of dofetilide was lost. to further refine our structural
analysis, we constructed a series of smaller chms and point

mutations in the s5-s6 linker region of herg. point mutations of herg amino acid 620 abolished high-affinity drug
binding and revealed a strong interaction between c-type
inactivation and high-affinity dofetilide binding.

materials and methods
the cdna clone for beag was isolated by a. baumann (genbank
accession no. y13430). beag was subcloned into a modified psp64
vector. herg/psp64 was a gift from m.t. keating (university of
utah, salt lake city). cdna for the point mutation herg s631v
was kindly provided by dr g.a. robertson (university of wisconsin,
madison).

mutagenesis and crna synthesis
for construction of chms bhs16, bhs56, and hbs56, the s1-s6
core regions of herg and beag were subcloned into pbluescript as
bsteii-xhoi and bstbi-kpni fragments, respectively. by use of codon
redundancy, the following silent restriction sites were introduced in
herg bsteii-xhoi (numbering according to genbank sequence):
nari (a to g at herg 1359), mlui (g to a at herg 1782), and
kpni (c to g at herg 2199). in addition, a nari site was destroyed
at herg 1329 (c to g). the mlui and kpni sites in herg were
introduced in positions equivalent to naturally occurring mlui and
kpni restriction sites in beag. in beag bstbi-kpni, a silent nari site
(a to g at beag 803, numbering according to genbank sequence)
was engineered in a position equivalent to the one introduced in
herg. all changes in the coding regions were verified by
sequencing.
a nari-kpni fragment was excised from herg bsteii-xhoi and
swapped with the corresponding beag fragment in the beagpbluescript construct, resulting in the chimeric pore region of bhs16.
in a final step, the bsteii-xhoi fragment was excised and subcloned
into full-length herg-psp64 from which the wild-type fragment
had been removed. for construction of bhs56 and hbs56, mluikpni fragments were excised and subcloned into the opposite pbluescript plasmids. in a second step, bsteii-xhoi and bstbi-kpni fragments were excised and subcloned into full-length herg-psp64 and
beag-psp64, respectively.
chms hbs5, hbs6, hbpore, herg ggps, herg knsv,
herg iss, and herg mt and all point mutations were generated
by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction using the mlui-kpni
cassettes generated in pbluescript herg bsteii-xhoi and pbluescript
beag bstbi-kpni. for all these constructs, the entire mlui-kpni
cassettes were sequenced before to subcloning into full-length
herg-psp64 and beag-psp64. sequenced constructs were transcribed into crna using the mmessage mmachine in vitro transcription kit (ambion) and sp6 polymerase after linearization with ecori
(herg, hbs5, hbs6, herg ggps, herg knsv, herg iss,
herg mt, and all point mutations in herg) or ecorv (beag,
bhs16, bhs56, hbs56, hbpore, and all point mutations in beag).
the ecorv site was inserted in psp64 adjacent to the ecori site.

expression in xenopus oocytes
in brief, xenopus oocytes were surgically removed and enzymatically
defolliculated by treatment with collagenase (2 mg/ml, 1.5 hours) in
calcium-free or2 solution (mmol/l): nacl 82.5, kcl 2.5, mgcl2 1,
and hepes 5 (ph 7.6). stage v-vi oocytes were injected with 46 nl

387

of 1 to 1000 ng/ml crna solution and incubated at 19°c in sos
solution (mmol/l): nacl 100, kcl 2, cacl2 1.8, mgcl2 1, hepes 5,
and  xxxd3055xxx  2.5 (1100 mg/ml  xxxd2193xxx ), ph 7.6.

electrophysiology

two-microelectrode voltage-clamp recordings
two to 7 days after injection, oocytes were voltage-clamped using
a dagan 8500 two-electrode voltage-clamp amplifier. current and
voltage electrodes were filled with 3 mol/l kcl and had resistances
of '1 mv. bath solutions in experiments using whole oocytes
were as follows (mmol/l): nacl 96, kcl 5, cacl2 1.8, mgcl2 1.0,
hepes 5 (k1 ringer’s solution 5, ph 7.4), cacl2 1.8, and hepes
10 with either kcl 115 (k1 ringer’s solution 115, ph 7.4) or cscl
115 (cs1 ringer’s solution 115, ph 7.4). in some recordings
1.0 mmol/l mgcl2 was added to the 115 mmol/l k1 ringer’s
solution. the pclamp software (axon instruments) was used for
the generation of voltage-clamp protocols and for data acquisition.
no leak subtraction was performed. for ic50 measurements,
dofetilide (n-[4-(-{-[4-(methanesulfonamino)-phenoxyl]-nmethylethylamino}ethyl)phenyl]methanesulfonamide, provided by
pfizer central research) was perfused in increasing concentrations
with 5 mmol/l k1 ringer’s solution. all ic50 measurements were
performed in xenopus oocytes held at 280 mv. during measurements, oocytes were continuously stimulated at a frequency of 1
hz with conditioning prepulses of 0 mv and 400-millisecond
duration to accelerate the onset of block. every 30 seconds,
currents were recorded with a depolarizing 1600-ms test pulse to 0
mv, followed by a 1600-ms pulse to 270 mv. in general, current
amplitudes were measured at the end of the depolarizing test pulse
to 0 mv. concentration-response measurements in hbs6 chms,
however, were made by analysis of current amplitudes on return to
2120 mv and not at the end of the depolarizing voltage command
to 0 mv.

macropatch recordings
macropatch recordings were performed as previously described.15
patch pipettes had resistances of 0.2 to 0.6 mv and were filled with
5 mmol/l k1 ringer’s solution (mmol/l): nacl 96, kcl 5, cacl2
1.8, mgcl2 1.0, and hepes 5 (ph 7.4). the depolarizing bath
solution had the following composition (mmol/l): kcl 100, edta
5, egta 5, and hepes 10 (iso-k1, ph 7.4). the pclamp software
was used for data acquisition. no leak subtraction was used. for ic50
measurements in the cell-attached configuration, whole oocytes were
perfused with increasing concentrations of dofetilide in iso-k1 bath
solution. concentration-response measurements in the cell-attached
mode were performed using the same voltage protocol as described for
two-microelectrode recordings in whole oocytes.
concentration-response relationships for dofetilide block were fit
to a hill equation of the following form:

idofetilide/icontrol51/[11(d/ic50)n]
where i indicates current, [d] is the dofetilide concentration, n is the
hill coefficient, and ic50 is the concentration necessary for 50% block.
all data are expressed as mean6sem. all measurements were performed at room temperature (20°c).

membrane depolarizations and exhibited limited outward current at more positive membrane depolarizations. the characteristic bell-shaped i-v relationship of herg was attributed to
a c-type inactivation mechanism that dominates at depolarized
potentials (fig 1b).2 on return to negative membrane potentials, removal of c-type inactivation resulted in an initial

increase in tail currents with slow deactivation kinetics. beag
gave rise to delayed rectifier–like outward currents with
activation kinetics strongly dependent on the holding potential
and an extremely fast current deactivation at more hyperpolarized membrane potentials (fig 1c and d). overall, the
biophysical properties of beag k1 channels were identical to
those described for mouse and rat eag channels (fig 1c and
1d).16,17 at the protein level, beag is '96% identical to both
rat and mouse eag. when compared with herg, beag
diverges considerably and shows only '50% identity with
herg in the hydrophobic core region s1-s6 of the channel
proteins.18
to analyze the high-affinity binding site of dofetilide in
herg k1 channels, we took advantage of the fact that beag
is '100-fold less sensitive to dofetilide than herg. ic50
values were measured in two-microelectrode whole-cell recordings with a prepulse protocol to accelerate the onset of
block (see “materials and methods”). fig 2a shows herg
currents recorded at 0 mv during perfusion of different
dofetilide concentrations. current amplitudes became more
and more reduced with increasing drug concentrations. current activation and deactivation kinetics, however, were not
modified. to test drug effects on current inactivation, we
isolated the inactivation process with the following voltageclamp protocol: cells were held at 140 mv, hyperpolarized for
20 milliseconds to 2100 mv to remove any inactivation
accumulated at holding potential, and finally depolarized to 0
mv. the voltage step to 0 mv elicited a rapidly decaying
outward current, which reflects the highly synchronized inactivation of herg channels available in a particular cell (inset,
fig 2a). time constants characterizing the inactivation process
were analyzed by fitting monoexponential functions to the
decaying outward currents. at membrane potentials of 240,
220, 0, and 120 mv, time constants were 13.560.4,
12.160.5, 9.160.6, and 5.760.4 milliseconds (n55). with

1 mmol/l dofetilide in the extracellular perfusate, time constants were 13.160.5, 11.660.6, 8.360.6, and 5.060.5 milliseconds (n55) and proved not to be different from control
values by means of student’s t test (p..05). although this
negative result does not exclude inactivated-state block, it
further supports the conclusion of two more recent reports that
the inactivated state is not a major target for dofetilide
binding.11,13 fig 2b shows that steady-state block was slowly
approached within 10 to 20 minutes after starting perfusion
with dofetilide. steady-state inhibition was determined by
monoexponential fits to the time course of amplitude reductions at each drug concentration applied. the ic50 of dofetilide
block was 0.3260.04 mmol/l (n524) in herg k1 channels.

ficker et al
the ic50 value of dofetilide block in whole oocytes expressing
herg k1 channels was '10-fold higher than those measured
in inside-out patches from oocytes expressing herg (ic50,
0.035 mmol/l13) or in whole-cell patch-clamp recordings
performed in hek293 cells transiently transfected with
herg (ic50, 0.012 mmol/l11). the lower affinity measured in
whole oocytes does not affect our study since we focus on
relative differences in sensitivity to dofetilide between wildtype channels and chimeric constructs/point mutations.
much higher dofetilide concentrations had to be used to block
beag channels (fig 2c). the ic50 was 31.867.5 mmol/l
(n56). the onset of block in beag k1 channels was much
faster. steady state was reached within 3 to 5 minutes. in marked
contrast to herg, during washout, 80% to 100% of initial
control values were reached within 3 to 10 minutes even at high
dofetilide concentrations (fig 2d). the fast onset and offset of
block in beag k1 channels prompted the question of whether
dofetilide might block beag k1 channels via an extracellular
interaction site. to resolve this, we added dofetilide in increasing
amounts to the extracellular bath solution while beag currents
were recorded from cell-attached macropatches. when the
above-described whole-cell pulse protocol was used, steady-state
inhibition was reached within 1 to 2 minutes in cell-attached
macropatch recordings. even more important, block by dofetilide
could be reversed within 3 to 4 minutes to 60% to 80% of control
levels (fig 2f). the time course of the developing block as well as
the washout are comparable to the time course seen in whole-cell
recordings. the ic50 in cell-attached macropatch recordings was
3.460.3 mmol/l (fit with a hill coefficient of 1, n57). thus,
dofetilide blocks beag from the cytoplasmic side of the
membrane.
herg and beag k1 channels were also differentially
blocked by e4031, another important methanesulfonanilide
drug. in herg k1 channels, we measured an ic50 of
3.5 mmol/l for e4031 block (n54). in beag k1 channels,
the ic50 was 180 mmol/l (n54). as described for dofetilide,
the onset/washout of block by e4031 was slow in herg k1
channels and fast in beag channels (data not shown).

accelerated deactivation by '10-fold.3,4 transplantation of the
complete conduction pathway s5-s6 of beag into herg
(hbs56 chm) resulted in a noninactivating beag-like
channel with an ic50 of dofetilide block close to the one
measured for beag wt (17.762.4 mmol/l [n56] versus
31.867.5 mmol/l [n56] for beag wt, figs 4b and 5). in
contrast, the reverse mutation bhs56 chm (with the herg
conduction pathway implanted into beag) showed an ic50
(0.760.14 mmol/l [n53]) close to the one measured in
herg wt (fig 5). current activation in bhs56 was exceedingly slow and showed a characteristic biphasic behavior (fig
4e1). beside the effects on kinetics, the voltage dependence of
activation was shifted to more positive values (fig 4e2). both
phenomena were controlled by [mg21]o (fig 4e3). although
the current activation in bhs56 chm was dominated by the
transplanted herg domains, the current deactivation was fast,
like beag. this provides further evidence that major determinants for current deactivation reside in n-terminal domains,
whereas current inactivation is largely controlled by the s1-s6
regions of these channel proteins.3,4,19 replacement of either s5
(hbs5 chm) or s6 (hbs6 chm) in herg with the
corresponding beag domain preserved c-type inactivation.
both hbs5 and hbs6 chms were very sensitive to dofetilide, with ic50 values of 0.4860.09 mmol/l (n54) and
0.1560.02 mmol/l (n57), respectively (fig 5). hbs5 chm
expressed herg-like currents with respect to activation,
deactivation, and inactivation (fig 4c). currents expressed by
hbs6, however, resembled inward rectifier currents (fig 4f1
and 4f2). this conversion from an outward rectifier to an
inward rectifier resulted from a disrupted activation gate in
combination with a c-type inactivation process left intact in
hbs6 chm. in fact, we were not able to close hbs6 chm
channels with hyperpolarizations up to 2180 mv. the putative k1 dependence suggested by the i-v relationships shown
in fig 4f3 can be explained as the simple reflection of changes
in reversal potential and driving force while [k1]o increased

transplantation of beag s5-s6 linker into
herg removes high-affinity block
dofetilide has been described as a slow-onset/slow-offset
open-channel blocker of herg, suggesting a binding site in
the conduction pathway.11,13 therefore, we constructed “large
scale” chms between herg and beag channels with a
main focus on those domains of the ion channel protein
thought to line the conduction pathway for k1: (1) transmembrane domain s5, (2) s5-s6 linker, or “pore” region, and (3)
transmembrane domain s6.
overall, six “large-scale” chms were constructed (fig 3).
transplantation of the complete s1 to s6 transmembrane
region of herg into beag (bhs16 chm) resulted in an
inactivating herg-like current with an ic50 of dofetilide
block close to herg wt (0.660.22 mmol/l [n55] versus
0.3260.04 mmol/l [n524] for herg wt) and accelerated
current activation and deactivation kinetics (figs 4a and 5).
overall, the phenotype of bhs16 chm was reminiscent of a
herg construct with a deletion in the n-terminus, herg
d2–373, which similarly did not eliminate inactivation but

beag chms. whole-cell measurements in xenopus oocytes
were performed at 280 mv. oocytes were continuously stimulated at a frequency of 1 hz with conditioning prepulses of 0
mv for 400 milliseconds to accelerate the onset of block. every
minute, currents were recorded with a depolarizing 1600-millisecond test pulse to 0 mv followed by a 1600-millisecond pulse
to 270 mv. [k1]o was 5 mmol/l. concentration-response measurements in hbs6 chm were made by analysis of current
amplitudes on return to 2120 mv. concentration-response relationships in herg wt, bhs16, hbs5, hbs6, and hbpore were
fit with hill equations according to a one-to-one binding scheme
(hill coefficient n51). fits to concentration-response curves
measured in beag wt and hbs56 are shown, assuming the
same binding scheme. for these two constructs, however, better fits could be obtained with hill coefficients of '0.6.

from 5 to 115 mmol/l. the activation of this current no
longer depended on movement of the voltage sensor; instead,
hbs6 channels were gated by removal of an inactivation gate,
which prevents outward current flow at more depolarized
potentials. the kinetics and voltage dependence of this inactivation process could be clearly resolved in recordings with
115 mmol/l [cs1]o (fig 4f4). cs1 is known for slowing
c-type inactivation in herg wt channels.3 furthermore,

current inactivation in hbs6 chm was slowed by increasing
the [k1]o and by extracellular applied tetraethylammonium
(data not shown). these results were consistent with the idea
that c-type inactivation is not impaired in hbs6 chms. since
switching neither the s5 nor the s6 domain resulted in major
changes of ic50 values, we transplanted the beag s5-s6 linker
region into herg (hbpore chm, fig 6a). in hbpore
chm, c-type inactivation and high-affinity dofetilide binding
were abolished, whereas the slow current activation and
deactivation characteristics for the parent channel herg were
preserved (fig 4d). for hbpore chm, an ic 50 of
148634 mmol/l (n58) was measured (fig 5). thus, the s5-s6
linker seems to contain the determinants for both dofetilide
binding and c-type inactivation.

chimeric constructs in the herg s5-s6
linker region
the s5-s6 linker with the putative binding site for dofetilide was divided into two regions: (1) 40 amino acids
preceding h5 and (2) the h5 domain (fig 6a). transplantation of the first 40 amino acids of the s5-s6 linker of
beag into herg (herg ggps) changed neither c-type
inactivation nor high-affinity dofetilide block (ic50 herg
ggps, 0.2160.03 mmol/l [n56]; figs 6b and 7a). in the
second region, the conserved h5 domain of the s5-s6
linker region, which is thought to harbor the selectivity
filter in k1 channels, the amino acid sequence is largely
preserved between herg and beag. we analyzed the
sequence differences between these two channels with three
separate constructs in this region (fig 6a). herg knsv
did not express currents. herg iss showed wild-type
behavior with respect to kinetics, c-type inactivation, and
dofetilide binding (ic50 herg iss, 0.3260.06 mmol/l
[n58]; figs 6b and 7b). in contrast, analysis of the double
mutation herg mt (herg f619m and s620t) exhibited major changes. c-type inactivation was completely
removed (fig 7c), and the affinity for dofetilide was
reduced (fig 6b). the ic50 was 123627 mmol/l (n55),
which was nearly identical to the one measured for the
large-scale chm hbpore (fig 5). thus, major determi-

a serine in position 620 is critical for
high-affinity dofetilide block and
c-type inactivation
since the characteristics of hbpore could be mimicked by the
double mutation herg mt, we constructed two single point
mutations, herg f619m and herg s620t, to evaluate
contributions from both positions separately. herg f619m
preserved c-type inactivation (fig 8a). in addition, this
mutation was blocked by very low dofetilide concentrations
(ic50, 0.4360.06mmol/l [n57]; fig 9). in contrast, the
conservative substitution of serine with threonine in position
620 resulted in a complete loss of c-type inactivation (fig 8c).
this was further confirmed with inside/out macropatch recordings. first, channels were maximally activated with depolarizations to 120 mv; after 650 milliseconds, the membrane
was stepped to potentials between 2100 and 190 mv (fig 8c,

instantaneous and no longer delayed by channels coming out

of inactivation. the rectification process, which dominates the
i-v relationship in whole-cell recordings at very positive
potentials (see fig 8c, middle), is due to a fast block by na1
ions.20 it is completely removed in inside/out recordings, since
macropatches were excised in a nominally na1-free solution
(iso-k1). the ic50 for dofetilide block increased dramatically
to 248629 mmol/l (n58, fig 9). of all the constructs
engineered in the present study, herg s620t was the least
sensitive to dofetilide, even less sensitive than hbpore chm
or the double mutation herg mt (fig 5). we conclude that
herg position 620 constitutes a hot spot in the pore region
for conformational changes tightly associated with c-type
inactivation and high-affinity dofetilide binding. a binding site
in the inner pore region as proposed for herg s620 would fit
data indicating that methanesulfonanilides access their binding
site from the intracellular site of the membrane.13,21
to gain further insight in the tight coupling between c-type
inactivation and dofetilide binding, we tested two point mutations
located in the outer mouth of the pore that have been shown to
interfere with c-type inactivation.3 we asked whether these
mutations would also modify block by dofetilide. both herg
s631a and herg s631v abolished c-type inactivation to a
large extent, whereas ic50 of dofetilide block was increased from

0.32 mmol/l in herg wt to 19.965.8 mmol/l (n55) and
42.466.6 mmol/l (n55), respectively. thus, the tight coupling
between c-type inactivation and dofetilide binding could also be
seen with mutations interfering with c-type inactivation via the
outer mouth of the channel pore. the reduction in dofetilide
sensitivity, however, was much less pronounced compared with
herg s620t (fig 5).
a clear separation between effects on c-type inactivation
and dofetilide binding could not be reached with constructs
analyzed so far. mutations supposedly located on opposite sites
of the membrane gave similar phenotypes: loss of drug binding
was always correlated with a loss of c-type inactivation. three
additional point mutations in herg s620 were constructed in
an attempt to further separate drug binding and current
inactivation. substitution of an alanine (herg s620a) or of
the bulkier valine (herg s620v) in position 620 resulted in
constructs that did not express current levels suitable for
analysis. the introduction of a cysteine in position 620
(herg s620c) gave functional channels with c-type inactivation removed. fig 8b shows currents recorded at membrane
potentials between 2100 and 180 mv. in these recordings, it
was striking that the rectification observed in herg s620t,
which could be attributed to a fast block by na1 ions, was not
present.20 therefore, we tested whether the permeability of
herg s620c was altered. permeability ratios for herg
wt, herg s620t, and herg s620c channels were
obtained from reversal potentials measured in two-microelectrode voltage-clamp experiments. the overall sequence of
cation permeabilities was preserved between these three constructs: k1$rb1.cs1..na1. however, whereas the na1
permeability was negligible for herg wt and herg
s620t (,0.01, n53), it was increased in herg s620c. we
measured a na1-k1 permeability of 0.0760.02 (n55). this
change in na1 permeability might be consistent with the idea
that this amino acid position contributes to the lining of the
inner pore region of herg k1 channels. in herg s620c,
half-maximal block by dofetilide was reached with a concentration of 5.760.9 mmol/l (n58, fig 9). this value is
intermediate to herg wt and herg s620t, as if part of
the dofetilide binding site could be preserved with this
substitution although current inactivation was abolished.
the experiments performed in herg s620c were consistent
with the idea that dofetilide binding could be at least partially
conserved in a noninactivating channel. therefore, we asked

downloaded from http://circres.ahajournals.org/ at north dakota state univ on june 28, 2015

ficker et al
whether it is possible to increase dofetilide binding in noninactivating beag channels by engineering a serine in the position
equivalent to herg s620. the ic50 for dofetilide block was
shifted in beag t432s from 31.8 mmol/l measured in beag
wt channels to 7.861.2 mmol/l (n55, fig 9). beag t432s
channels expressed noninactivating delayed rectifier currents, as
shown with two-microelectrode and high resolution inside/out
macropatch recordings (fig 8d). neither current activation nor
current deactivation was modified compared with the parent
channel beag wt. as a control, we mutated amino acid
position 443 in beag. position 443 is equivalent to herg
s631, the above-described position in the extracellular mouth of
the herg channel pore interfering with c-type inactivation and
dofetilide binding. the alanine in the beag wt channel was
replaced by a serine as expressed in herg wt in the corresponding position (see fig 6a). beag a443s channels expressed
noninactivating outward currents. the i-v relationship for these
currents showed that the voltage dependence was not significantly
different from that for beag t432s and beag wt (fig 8e).
the ic50 value of dofetilide block, however, was not shifted to
lower values as described for beag t432s (ic50, 7.8 mmol/l).
instead, it was increased from 31.8 mmol/l (beag wt) to
41.865.0 mmol/l (n55, figs 5 and 9).

discussion
several chimeric and mutant channels were engineered to
identify amino acid residues critical for block by dofetilide. a
single point mutation, herg s620t, which introduced an
additional methyl group in the side chain of the native channel,
has been found to reduce the affinity for dofetilide by
'800-fold. the reduction in dofetilide block correlated with
a complete loss of channel inactivation. substitution of a
cysteine for the native serine in this position resulted in a
channel with an altered permeability for na1 ions. this might
indicate that the residue in position herg 620 (by analogy to
topological models proposed for k1 channels in the kv gene
family22) is directed to the cytoplasmic part of the ion conduction pathway and would be consistent with an intracellular
binding site for dofetilide as proposed more recently. the
results obtained with mutations in herg s620, however,
have to be contrasted with mutations of an amino acid residue
in the extracellular mouth of the herg k1 channel pore,
herg s631a and herg s631v. although similar to
herg s620t in terms of removal of c-type inactivation and
lowered drug affinity, herg s631 faces the opposite site of
the membrane from herg s620. the tight coupling between
high-affinity block by dofetilide and c-type inactivation obtained by independent mutations at two residues might be
most easily explained by a model in which dofetilide binds
preferentially to the inactivated state of herg. in such a
model, abolishing the inactivated state would necessarily result
in a loss of high-affinity drug binding. on the other hand, our
data do not support dofetilide binding to the inactivated state
of this channel since (1) dofetilide does not accelerate the
inactivation time course of herg channels and (2) strong
depolarizations of long duration delay the development of
block rather than enhance it.11,13 thus, the loss of high-affinity
drug binding that correlates with a loss of c-type inactivation
might be better explained by the disruption of an earlier

393

obligatory conformational step, which is essential for both drug
binding and c-type inactivation. more recently, the kinetic
properties of herg currents were successfully simulated by a
linear model consisting of three closed states, one open state,
and one inactivated state.23 since herg channels were not
blocked when kept closed, high-affinity block of closed states
could be eliminated. on the contrary, the requirement for
channel activation suggested open-channel block. however, it
has been reported that dofetilide does not produce significant
changes in single-channel open time.13 also, the ic50 measured
for dofetilide and mk-499 in heterologously expressed herg
channels seemed not to depend on [k1]o, as one would expect
for open-channel block.12,13 the influence of [k1]o, however,
remains controversial, since in at1 tumor cells block of native
ikr channels by dofetilide was dependent on [k1]o.24 furthermore, open-channel block is hard to reconcile with mutations
such as herg s620t, in which removal of the inactivated
state would be linked to a dramatic increase in the availability
of a binding site associated with the open state. at this point,
it may be important to reconsider that herg channels
showed bursting behavior. such bursting behavior can result
from a frequently revisited brief closed state, which exists as the
final step in the activation pathway. alternatively, these short
closures might represent dwells in a preinactivated state.
binding of dofetilide to such a short-lived closed state would
help to understand (1) why there is no competition of drug
binding with external k1 and (2) why the on rates for block are
exceedingly slow, although dofetilide concentrations reached
steady-state levels in xenopus oocytes after equilibration times
of only 2 to 4 minutes, as shown in experiments with beag.
such short equilibration times are expected for a drug that is
only '30% protonated at physiological ph.25 in contrast, it
took 10 to 20 minutes to reach steady-state block in measurements with herg expressed in oocytes. on the other hand,
it is difficult to envisage a kinetic model in which simple
removal of inactivation (as shown for herg s620t) would
decrease the availability of a short-lived closed state in the
activation pathway. at the same time, our experiments do not
provide enough information for an interpretation of these
short closures as dwells into a preinactivated state. according to
such an interpretation, however, the prediction would be that
bursting behavior should be strongly reduced in mutations
such as herg s620t, ie, mutations with low affinity for
dofetilide binding and no c-type inactivation. a clear answer
to the question of which state may be the target for dofetilide
is currently not possible.
since mutations and chms in the pore region that showed
a loss of drug binding always exhibited a loss of c-type
inactivation, it is possible that the change observed in drug
binding is due to indirect nonspecific allosteric modifications
in the structure of the channel protein and not to the direct
interaction of dofetilide with the respective mutated site
chains. if we assume that the pore region might not participate
directly in dofetilide binding, the chimeric approach used in
the present study should still have identified alternative protein
domains as candidates for drug binding, assuming that residues
conserved between both parent channels play no crucial role in
drug binding. chms such as bhs16, hbs56, and bhs56
reveal no contribution from the n- and c-terminus or

dofetilide block of herg k1 channels

transmembrane domains s1 to s4 to a binding site. this result
is in line with the low homology between herg and beag
on the protein level, especially in the n- and c-terminal
regions. the dofetilide affinity of all chimeric constructs
studied seemed to be entirely controlled by the ion conduction
pathway composed of s5, s5-s6 linker, and s6. if this part of
the protein originated from herg, we observed high-affinity
drug binding; if it originated from beag, we observed
low-affinity binding. revisiting the chms engineered in the
conduction pathway shows clearly that transplantation of the
beag s5 domain into herg resulted in a channel with
herg-like properties (ie, c-type inactivation, high-affinity
dofetilide binding site, and slow current activation and deactivation) and gave no hint for an association of drug binding
with s5. at this point, it is important to mention that 16 of 24
amino acids are conserved between beag and herg s5
domains. on the other hand, transplantation of the beag s6
domain into herg disrupted the gating properties of the
recipient channel completely; the activation gate was largely
destroyed, whereas c-type inactivation was entirely conserved.
although this transplantation caused major structural changes,
hbs6 chm was very sensitive to dofetilide. in fact, it was the
only chm engineered with an affinity clearly greater than
herg wt. in this case, 18 of 29 amino acids are conserved.
it is not clear whether the enhanced affinity measured in hbs6
chm is due to allosteric effects or due to a contribution of
specific amino acid residues in beag s6. the effects caused by
transplantation of beag s6, however, deserve special attention, since in voltage-gated  xxxg1234xxx  channels, it has been shown
that hydrophobic residues in the s6 transmembrane domain
play a central role in block by the antiarrhythmic drug
quinidine.26 a comparison to quinidine binding in voltagegated na1 channels identifies common structural motifs in
both voltage-gated k1 and na1 channels, which define this
drug-channel interaction.27 surprisingly, this domain seems to
be less important for methanesulfonanilide binding in herg/
ikr as judged from our chimeric approach. a more systematic
analysis of all amino acid residues in s6 (eg, by alanine scanning
mutagenesis) might be necessary to evaluate the role played by
s6 residues in dofetilide binding.
since the chm approach was not able to identify domains
outside the s5-s6 linker region of the herg channel as
putative candidates involved in drug binding, we have to ask
whether the pore region itself participates in dofetilide binding.
the main analytical problem is the tight coupling between
drug binding and c-type inactivation. we were able to
reconstruct a dofetilide binding site in beag by introducing a
serine in beag 432, a position equivalent to herg s620.
beag t432s resulted in a channel 4-fold more sensitive to
dofetilide than beag wt but did not introduce changes in
activation or inactivation. on the contrary, mutations in the
outer mouth of the beag channel at position 443, which is
equivalent to herg s631, shifted the ic50 from 32 mmol/l in
wt channels to 42 mmol/l in beag a443s. again, the
activation and inactivation properties were not affected by this
mutation. similarly, a comparison of herg s620t with
herg s620c revealed that the introduction of a cysteine
residue in position 620 shifted the ic50 from 248 to
5.7 mmol/l, resulting in a channel '40-fold more sensitive

than herg s620t. these results support the conclusion that
in noninactivating channels, mutations of amino acid residues
in herg 620 or beag 432 alter the sensitivity of these
channels to dofetilide. in both cases, the observed changes have
to result from alterations in interactions of side chains with the
bound drug. we could not observe any effects of these
mutations on activation or inactivation when beag t432s
and beag a443s were compared with beag wt or when
herg s620t was compared with herg s620c. in summary, these observations point to a direct interaction of
dofetilide with residue 432 in beag k1 channels. a similar
interaction site could be identified for noninactivating channels
constructed in herg, such as herg s620t and herg
s620c. similarly, mutations in the outer mouth of the pore at
position herg631 were '8-fold more sensitive to dofetilide
than was herg s620t, with c-type inactivation largely
abolished. the explanation might be that mutations in the
outer mouth of the channel pore do not alter the amino acid
sequence of an internal binding site but simply change the
conformation of that site somewhat. whether the same principles govern high-affinity block in herg wt must be
explored in greater detail in future experiments. the fact is that
minor side-chain modifications at position herg620 alter the
function of the channel extensively and significantly. this
argues strongly that the wild-type side chain interacts with
some other part of the channel protein that confers the
conformation needed to obtain inactivation. one explanation
for our failure to reconstruct a binding site with nanomolar
affinity might simply be that beag t432s does not reproduce
c-type inactivation as indicated by the outwardly rectifying
i-v relationship.
although the role played by amino acid position 620 in
herg wt is not completely understood with respect to
dofetilide binding, we find that this residue is crucial for
c-type inactivation. it has been shown that the equivalent
residues in shaker (shaker v438) and  xxxg1237xxx  channels (i369) are
located within the ion conduction pathway.22,28 interestingly,
mutations in  xxxg1237xxx  i369 can introduce c-type inactivation (or
p-type inactivation, as it was originally named in  xxxg1237xxx  or in
chimeras closely related to  xxxg1237xxx ).28 none of these  xxxg1237xxx 
mutations, however, was blocked by dofetilide up to
100 mmol/l (data not shown). although herg k1 channels
belong to a different gene family, the importance of herg
s620 with respect to c-type inactivation has been preserved.
all point mutations in herg s620 interfered with c-type
inactivation. these results indicate that c-type inactivation is
not entirely localized to residues in the outer mouth of the
pore region. c-type inactivation might also involve structural
changes in deeper parts of the pore, with conformational
changes imposed on a more extended group of amino acids
than previously proposed.29
the structural requirements described in the present study
for high-affinity binding of dofetilide to its receptor site might
shed some light on the molecular basis underlying the exquisite
specificity of methanesulfonanilide drugs for herg/ikr channel proteins. our data should prove useful for a first understanding of class iii antiarrhythmic drug action and might help
in the future to circumvent some of the side effects that still
restrict the therapeutic potential of those drugs.
