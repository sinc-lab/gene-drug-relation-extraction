selectivities of dihydropyridine derivatives in blocking ca(2+) channel subtypes expressed in xenopus oocytes.  some dihydropyridines (dhps), such as amlodipine and cilnidipine, have been shown to block not only l-type but also n-type ca(2+) channels; therefore, dhps are no longer considered as l-type-specific ca(2+) channel blockers. however, selectivity of dhps for ca(2+) channel subtypes including n-, p/q-, and r-types are poorly understood. to address this issue at the molecular level, blocking effects of 10 dhps (nifedipine,  xxxd2726xxx , barnidipine,  xxxd2728xxx ,  xxxd2737xxx , amlodipine,  xxxd2718xxx , benidipine,  xxxd2092xxx , and cilnidipine) on four subtypes of ca(2+) channels (l-, n-, p/q-, and r-types) were investigated in the xenopus oocyte expression system with the use of the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. l-type ca(2+) channels expressed as alpha(1c)alpha(2)beta(1a) combination were profoundly blocked by all dhps examined, whereas blocking actions of these dhps on r-type (alpha(1e)alpha(2)beta(1a)) channels were equally weak. in contrast, 5 of the 10 dhps (amlodipine, benidipine, cilnidipine,  xxxd2718xxx , and barnidipine) significantly blocked n-type (alpha(1b)alpha(2)beta(1a)) and p/q-type (alpha(1a)alpha(2)beta(1a)) ca(2+) channels. these selectivities of dhps in blocking ca(2+) channel subtypes would provide useful pharmacological and clinical information on the mode of action of the drugs including side effects and adverse effects.
