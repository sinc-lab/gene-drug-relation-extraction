abstract
aims/hypothesis increased glucagon secretion predicts deterioration of glucose tolerance, and high glucagon levels
contribute to hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes. inhibition
of glucagon action may therefore be a potential novel target to
reduce hyperglycaemia. here, we investigated whether
chronic treatment with a  xxxg874xxx  antagonist
(gra) improves islet dysfunction in female mice on a highfat diet (hfd).
materials and methods after 8 weeks of hfd, mice were
treated with a small molecule gra (300 mg/kg, gavage once
daily) for up to 30 days. insulin secretion was studied after
oral and intravenous administration of glucose and glucagon
secretion after intravenous arginine. islet morphology was
examined and insulin secretion and glucose oxidation were
measured in isolated islets.
results fasting plasma glucose levels were reduced by gra
(6.0±0.2 vs 7.4±0.5 mmol/l; p=0.017). the acute insulin
response to intravenous glucose was augmented (1,300±110

vs 790±64 pmol/l; p<0.001). the early insulin response to
oral glucose was reduced in mice on hfd + gra (1,890±
160 vs 3,040±420 pmol/l; p=0.012), but glucose excursions
were improved. intravenous arginine significantly increased
the acute glucagon response (129±12 vs 36±6 ng/l in
controls; p<0.01), notably without affecting plasma glucose.
gra caused a modest increase in alpha cell mass, while beta
cell mass was similar to that in mice on hfd + vehicle.
isolated islets displayed improved glucose-stimulated insulin
secretion after gra treatment (0.061±0.007 vs 0.030±
0.004 pmol islet−1 h−1 at 16.7 mmol/l glucose; p<0.001),
without affecting islet glucose oxidation.
conclusions/interpretation chronic  xxxg874xxx  antagonism in hfd-fed mice improves islet sensitivity to
glucose and increases insulin secretion, suggesting improvement of key defects underlying impaired glucose tolerance
and type 2 diabetes.

introduction
glucagon plays a key role in maintaining circulating
glucose mainly through its regulation of hepatic glucose
production [1, 2]. the hormone binds to specific glucagon
receptors on the hepatocytes and activates the glycogenolytic and gluconeogenetic pathways, thereby increasing
hepatic glucose output [3, 4]. the action of glucagon is
opposed by insulin; in fact, the ratio between insulin and
glucagon is a major determinant of ambient circulating
glucose levels [5, 6]. several studies have suggested that
glucagon is implicated in the development of type 2
diabetes [7–10]. thus, it has been shown that increased
secretion of glucagon predicts igt in humans [11] and that
igt is associated with impaired suppression of glucagon
secretion [12–14]. furthermore, plasma glucagon levels are
elevated in subjects with type 2 diabetes [2, 15, 16].
particularly in the presence of low insulin, hyperglucagonaemia may result in increased glucose production and
thereby further contribute to the hyperglycaemia caused by
insulin deficiency resulting from beta cell failure and
insulin resistance [17]. together these findings suggest that
inhibition of glucagon action may be a novel target for
treatment of type 2 diabetes. in fact, both glucagonneutralising antibodies [18–20] and peptide glucagon
receptor antagonists (gra) [21, 22] efficiently reduce
glycaemia in various rodent models. for a potential drug
development, several non-peptidyl small molecule gras
have been tested and proven to inhibit glucagon-mediated
metabolic effects [23–25].  xxxg874xxx  antagonism
reduces hepatic glucose production in healthy humans [26],
further indicating that glucagon antagonists may be a new
class of agents for treating type 2 diabetes. recent studies
have used the anti-sense technique to reduce the expression
of glucagon receptors, which led to improved glycaemia in
diabetic rodents [27, 28]. it is also of interest that mice with
targeted disruption of the  xxxg874xxx  gene have
significantly reduced blood glucose levels and improved
glucose tolerance compared with wild-type mice [29–31].
the underlying cause of hyperglycaemia in type 2
diabetes is impaired beta cell function in association with
insulin resistance [32–35]. glucagon stimulates insulin
secretion and  xxxg874xxx  signalling has been shown
to be required for full glucose competence in beta cells
[36]. this would suggest that  xxxg874xxx  antagonism, if developed as a glucose-lowering agent, might
deteriorate insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes, thus
counterbalancing its beneficial effects. however, a recent
study using the antisense technique to reduce glucagon
receptor expression demonstrated increased insulin secretion, thereby suggesting improved islet function [28]. it is
thus unclear whether islet function is perturbed by
inhibition of glucagon action. in this study, therefore, we

diabetologia (2007) 50:1453–1462

investigated whether  xxxg874xxx  antagonism affects
islet function in a model of type 2 diabetes using mice fed a
high-fat diet (hfd). this model has previously been shown
to be associated with: (1) insulin resistance, as determined
by euglycaemic–hyperinsulinaemic clamp [37]; (2) impaired insulin secretion resulting in glucose intolerance
[38]; and (3) hyperglucagonaemia [39]. we thus treated
hfd-fed mice chronically with a small molecule that has
 xxxg874xxx  antagonistic properties and studied
insulin secretion in vivo and in vitro in isolated islets. the
gra has been characterised previously and demonstrated
to dose-dependently inhibit glucagon-stimulated hepatic
glucose production in live dogs [40]. we also examined
whether the glucagon response to intravenous administration of arginine was affected by long-term glucagon
receptor antagonism. the rationale for this was that
following  xxxg874xxx  antagonism or after genetic
ablation of the  xxxg874xxx , alpha cell hyperplasia can
evolve, resulting in exaggerated plasma levels of glucagon
[26, 28–30]. it would therefore be of value to establish
whether glucagon secretion is also affected after chronic
treatment with a gra.

materials and methods
characterisation of the  xxxg874xxx  antagonist the
 xxxg874xxx  antagonist nnc 25-0926 [(2r)-n-[4-({4(1-cyclohexen-1-yl)[(3,5-dichloroanilino)carbonyl]anilino}
methyl)benzoyl]-2-hydroxy-beta-alanine] has only 12% bioavailability after oral administration, a short half-life
(t1/2 =41 min) and is rapidly cleared from the circulation
in rats (clearance rate: 32 ml min−1 kg−1). furthermore,
nnc 25-0926 is a potent gra with an inhibitory
concentration of 50% (ic50) value of 12 nmol/l for
inhibition of glucagon binding to cloned  xxxd2208xxx 
receptors expressed in baby hamster kidney cells (e.
nishimura and u. g. sidelmann, unpublished observations). it is also specific for the  xxxg874xxx  in that it
binds poorly to related receptors (ic50: human glucosedependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor: 625 nmol/l;
human vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor:
429 nmol/l; and human  xxxg873xxx  [glp-1]
receptor: 21,000 nmol/l). based on these characteristics,
and particularly the low oral bioavailability, a dose of
300 mg/kg was selected for this study.
animals and study design female c57bl/6jbomtac mice
(8 weeks old; taconic, skensved, denmark) were maintained in a temperature-controlled room (22°c) on a 12 h
light–dark cycle. the mice were divided into two groups
and fed either a normal diet (nd; 11% energy as fat, 16%
as protein, 73% as carbohydrate; research diets, new

diabetologia (2007) 50:1453–1462

brunswick, nj, usa) or an hfd (58% fat, 16% protein,
26% carbohydrate; research diets). body weight was
measured once a week. blood samples were taken at
indicated time points from the intraorbital, retrobulbar
plexus from overnight fasted (16 h), anaesthetised mice
(20 mg/kg fluanisone–0.8 mg/kg fentanyl; janssen, beerse,
belgium; 10 mg/kg midazolam; hoffman-laroche, basel,
switzerland). after feeding mice with the nd or hfd for
8 weeks, the hfd-fed mice were divided into two groups
receiving either 300 mg/kg gra dissolved in vehicle
(veh; 0.13 mg/ml  xxxd3521xxx  as tocopheryl polyethylene
glycol 1,000 succinate (tpgs), 0.015 mg/ml kollidon 12
pf, 65 mmol/l sodium phosphate buffer, ph 7.0) (hfdgra) or veh only (hfd-veh), by gavage once daily
(08.00 h, 0.5 ml per mouse). nd-fed mice were treated with
veh (nd-veh). the in vivo experiments were performed
in overnight-fasted, anaesthetised mice. the mice were
given their daily dose of gra or veh 2 h before the
experiments. the study was approved by the animal ethics
committee in lund/malmö, sweden.
glucose tolerance tests and insulin release after 17–18 days
of gra treatment, ivgtts were performed. mice were
anaesthetised as described 30 min prior to the ivgtt.
thereafter a blood sample (50 mul) was taken from the
retrobulbar, intraorbital capillary plexus, after which d-glucose
(1 g/kg [5.6 mmol/kg]; sigma, st louis, mo, usa) was
injected intravenously in a tail vein (volume load 10 mul/g).
additional blood samples were taken at 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and
75 min after injection. for ogtts, anaesthetised mice were
given 75 mg [0.42 mmol] d-glucose by intragastric gavage.
blood samples were collected 0, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min after
glucose administration. following immediate centrifugation
(10,000 g) at 4°c, plasma was separated and stored at −20°c
until analysis of glucose and insulin.
glucagon secretion glucagon secretion was measured after
17–21 days of gra treatment after intravenous injections
of l-arginine (0.25 g/kg). blood samples (60 mul) were
collected in 10 mul aprotinin (1.4 mg/ml; bayer health care,
leverkusen, germany) at 0, 1, 5, 20 and 50 min after the
arginine injection and handled as described above. samples
were stored at −20°c until analysis of glucose and
glucagon.
euglycaemic–hyperinsulinaemic clamp hfd-fed mice
were subjected to a euglycaemic–hyperinsulinaemic clamp
after 21–24 days of gra treatment, as described [37]. two
hours before the clamp study, non-fasted mice were given
their daily treatment. mice were anaesthetised (as above)
and the right jugular vein and left carotid artery were
catheterised for infusion of glucose and insulin (actrapid;
novo nordisk, bagsværd, denmark) and for blood sam-

1455

pling, respectively. thirty minutes after insertion of the
catheters, insulin was infused at a rate of 40 mu kg−1 min−1
for 1 min, followed by constant infusion of 20 mu kg−1
min−1. blood glucose levels were determined every 5 min
for 90 min using a glucose analyser (hemocue b;
hemocue, ängelholm, sweden). a glucose solution (20%,
by weight) was infused at a variable rate to maintain blood
glucose levels at the target of 6.5 mmol/l. blood samples
were taken at 0 and 90 min to determine insulin levels.
insulin sensitivity was calculated as the mean of the glucose
infusion rates (gir) from 60 to 90 min.
insulin and glucose measurements glucose was measured
with the glucose oxidase method using 2,2′-azino-bis(3ethyl-benzothialozine-6-sulfonate) as substrate, absorbance
being measured at 420 nm on a microtitre plate reader
(fluostar/polarstar galaxy; bmg labtechnologies, offenburg, germany). insulin was determined radioimmunochemically using a guinea pig anti-rat insulin antibody,
125
i-labelled  xxxd2364xxx  as tracer and rat insulin as
standard (linco research, st charles, mo, usa). glucagon
was analysed using a radioimmunoassay with a guinea pig
anti-glucagon antibody, 125i-labelled glucagon as tracer and
glucagon standard (linco research). for both assays free
and bound radioactivity were separated by use of an antiigg (goat anti-guinea pig) antibody. radioactivity was
measured on a gamma counter (wallac wizard 1470;
perkin elmer, turku, finland).
islet isolation and insulin secretion after mice had been
treated with the gra for 24–30 days, islets were isolated
from the pancreas by collagenase digestion and handpicked
under microscope. batches of islets were preincubated in
hepes  xxxd2988xxx  (hbss; 125 mmol/l nacl,
5.9 mmol/l kcl, 1.28 mmol/l cacl2, 1.2 mmol/l mgcl2,
25 mmol/l hepes [ph 7.4], 5.6 mmol/l glucose and 0.1%
fatty-acid-free bovine albumin) (boehringer mannheim,
mannheim, germany) for 60 min. thereafter, islets in
groups of three were incubated in 200 mul of the hbss with
varying concentrations of glucose and incubated for 60 min
at 37°c. after incubation, aliquots of 25 mul in duplicates
were collected and stored at −20°c until analysis of insulin
as above.
islet insulin and glucagon content batches of four islets
were frozen, thawed and then sonicated in acidic ethanol
(0.2 mol/l hcl in 87.5% ethanol, by volume). the
procedure was repeated twice. the samples were then
centrifuged (10,000 g) and total insulin and glucagon
contents were measured in the supernatant fractions.
 xxxg341xxx /7 activity islets were solubilised in 20 mmol/l
tris-hcl, 150 mmol/l nacl, 2 mmol/l edta and 1% triton x-

1456

islet glucose oxidation glucose oxidation was measured in
isolated islets. batches of 30 islets in quadruplicates were
incubated in a reaction mixture containing 3.7 or 26 kbq
[14c]glucose (specific activity 11.5 gbq/mmol; nen,
boston, ma, usa) as tracer, at final concentrations of 2.8
or 16.7 mmol/l glucose. the reaction was terminated after
incubation of the samples for 2 h at 37°c, and the amount
of released 14co2 trapped with benzetonium hydroxide was
determined by liquid scintillation counting.
immunocytochemistry and morphometry the islets were
examined using indirect immunofluorescence as described
[41]. sections were incubated with primary antibodies
(rabbit anti-porcine-glucagon, code 7811, dilution 1:5,120;
guinea pig anti-human- xxxg1193xxx , code 9003, dilution
1:2,560; eurodiagnostica, malmo, sweden) and with
secondary antibodies with specificity for rabbit- or guinea
pig-igg coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate (jackson,
west grove, pa, usa) or texas red (sigma). the
specificity of the immunostaining was tested by preabsorption with homologous peptide (100 mug/ml diluted
antiserum). islet alpha and beta cell areas were determined
as previously reported [42]. in brief, serial sections (nine
for each animal) on coded slides from five hfd-veh and
three hfd-gra mice, double-stained for glucagon and
insulin, were analysed using image pro plus software
(media cybernetics, bethesda, md, usa). we randomly
selected ten islets in each section and calculated the
immunostained area.
statistical analysis all data are presented as mean ± sem.
in the ivgtt, the acute insulin response to intravenous
glucose was calculated as the mean of suprabasal 1 and
5 min values, and the glucose elimination was quantified
using the glucose elimination constant, kg, calculated as
the slope of the logarithmic transformation of circulating
glucose between 1 and 20 min after the glucose bolus.
the suprabasal auc was calculated from 0 to 60 min by
the trapezoid rule. the early insulin response in ogtt
was defined as the 15-min peak value over basal
secretion. the acute glucagon response to arginine was
calculated as the mean of suprabasal 1 and 5 min values.
multiple comparisons between the different groups were
performed by one-way anova and tukey’s post hoc test
to calculate statistical differences between the groups.
significant statistical difference was considered to be
present at p<0.05.

results
body weight and fasting blood parameters body weight
was significantly higher in mice fed hfd for 8 weeks than
in nd-fed mice (p<0.001; fig. 1). during treatment with
the gra or veh, body weight decreased slightly in hfdfed mice, although with no significant difference between
the two treatment groups (fig. 1).
treatment with the gra for 17–18 days resulted in
significant reduction in overnight fasting plasma glucose
levels compared with hfd-veh (table 1). there was a
trend towards lower plasma glucose levels in hfd-gra
than in nd-veh, although this difference was not
statistically significant. in contrast, there was no difference
in fasting insulin levels between the treatment groups. the
hfd-veh group had elevated glucagon levels compared
with the nd-veh group, an increase that was even more
marked and significantly so in hfd-gra mice compared
with both veh groups (table 1).
intravenous and oral glucose tolerance test glucose tolerance was impaired in hfd-fed mice compared with nd-fed
mice (fig. 2a). following gra treatment for 17–18 days,
glucose elimination was improved and did not differ from
that in nd-veh mice (fig. 2a, table 1). the acute insulin
response was augmented in hfd-veh mice compared with
nd-veh and significantly augmented in hfd-gra compared with both veh groups (table 1). hence, as evident
from the results of the ivgtt, gra improved glucose
tolerance and the insulin response to glucose in mice with
hfd-induced glucose intolerance (fig. 2).
there were only small differences in glucose tolerance
between hfd- and nd-fed mice, which is different from
previous data demonstrating clear glucose intolerance in the

former [38]. this difference is explained by the experimental conditions. here, the ivgtt was performed in mice
fasted overnight, conditions in which glucose intolerance is
less pronounced in hfd-fed mice. in mice fasted for 4 h,
basal glucose and insulin levels were elevated compared
with nd-fed mice. after an overnight fast, basal blood
glucose and insulin levels were not different between the
two feeding groups (table 1). however, logarithmic
transformation of the glucose levels in the ivgtt revealed
that mice fed the hfd were glucose intolerant (fig. 2b)
despite significantly elevated insulin levels (fig. 2c). the
results thus show that gra improved glucose tolerance by
increasing the insulin secretion.
the ogtt demonstrated that the increase in plasma
glucose was reduced in hfd-gra compared with hfdveh mice (fig. 3a), which was illustrated by a reduced
aucglu0-60 (table 1). the improved glucose excursions
observed in hfd-gra mice were accompanied by reduced
insulin secretion (fig. 3b, table 1), with significantly
reduced early insulin response (3,040±420 vs 1,890±
160 pmol/l, p=0.012) and aucins0-60 (table 1).
glucagon secretion after treatment with the gra for 17–
21 days, the glucagon response to intravenous l-arginine
was examined. again, basal glucose levels were significantly reduced in hfd-gra compared with hfd-veh
mice (fig. 4a), while basal glucagon levels were significantly elevated (p<0.05 compared with nd and hfd-

veh; fig. 4b, table 1). comparing the acute glucagon
response to arginine, we found it significantly higher in
hfd-gra than in hfd-veh mice (p<0.01; table 1).
notably, no effect on glucose levels was seen in the hfdgra treatment group despite elevated glucagon levels,
suggesting that inhibition of the glucagon signal had
occurred after gra administration, because the acute rise
in glucose after arginine administration is largely dependent
on glucagon.
euglycaemic–hyperinsulinaemic clamp after 21–25 days of
gra treatment, hfd-fed mice were subjected to euglycaemic–hyperinsulinaemic clamp experiments (fig. 5a). during
the 60–90 min clamp, plasma glucose levels were 6.5±
0.2 mmol/l in hfd-gra, 6.3±0.2 mmol/l in hfd-veh and
6.3±0.06 mmol/l in nd mice. the corresponding insulin
levels were 14,500±2,600, 13,900±2,000 and 11,000±
1,200 pmol/l, respectively. the mean gir needed to
maintain a stable glucose level between 60 and 90 min,
was significantly higher in the hfd-gra than in the hfdveh group (0.059±0.007 vs 0.042±0.008 mmol kg−1 min−1
in hfd-veh; p=0.021) (fig. 5b). this suggests that insulin
action is improved after  xxxg874xxx  antagonism in
hfd-fed mice. in the nd-fed control mice gir was 0.105±
0.013 mmol kg−1 min−1.

secretion in freshly isolated islets from the hfd-gra group
was augmented in response to 11.1 and 16.7 mmol/l glucose
compared with islets from hfd-veh mice (p<0.001 at both
concentrations) and with those from nd-veh mice at
16.7 mmol/l glucose (p=0.036; fig. 6a). the glucose
concentration at which half-maximal insulin response was
observed was significantly lower in islets from hfd-gra
mice (11.3 mmol/l) than in those from the hfd-veh group
(13.7 mmol/l) and similar to that in islets from nd-veh
mice (11.0 mmol/l). this shows that both the insulin
response to glucose and the glucose sensitivity of the islet
were augmented by gra treatment.

due to increased glucose metabolism, glucose oxidation
was measured at 2.8 and 16.7 mmol/l glucose in freshly
isolated islets. however, no difference in islet glucose
oxidation was seen between the different treatment groups
(fig. 6b), suggesting that other mechanisms are involved in
potentiating gsis in hfd-gra mice.
islet insulin content was increased in response to the
hfd. there was a slight reduction in islet insulin content in
islets from hfd-gra mice, though not statistically
different from the two veh-treated groups (table 1). islet
glucagon content was similar in the three treatment groups
(table 1).
to evaluate whether gra treatment may potentially
damage islets and cause apoptosis,  xxxg341xxx /7 activity was
measured in isolated islets. there were no differences in
 xxxg341xxx /7 activity in the various groups (table 1).

in hfd vs 6,600±1,200 mum2 in hfd-gra; p=0.017). in
contrast, beta cell mass did not differ between the groups
(11,800±2,300 in hfd vs 16,500±3,400 mum2 in hfdgra; p>0.05). this resulted in a tendency towards a lower
ratio of beta cell to alpha cell mass in hfd-gra mice (3.9±
0.9 in hfd, 2.3±0.2 in hfd-gra).

islets incubated with glucose, with improved islet sensitivity to glucose. interestingly, this effect was not due to
increased islet glucose oxidation. however, it could not be
ruled out that glucose metabolism might be altered at other
levels resulting in increased insulin secretion. another
possible explanation for the improved gsis is increased
expression of glp-1 in islets. others have suggested that
increased expression of proglucagon, which is apparent
after inhibition of glucagon signalling, may result in
increased islet production of glp-1 [28, 29]. proglucagon
is cleaved by prohormone convertases in the alpha cells to
produce mainly glucagon and, to a much smaller extent,
glp-1 [43, 44]. the results demonstrate that long-term
treatment with gra results in improved islet glucose
sensitivity, indicating that inhibition of the glucagon signal,
directly or indirectly, has significant and beneficial effects
on beta cell function.
gra treatment increased alpha cell mass as well as
glucagon secretion in response to arginine. mice with a null
mutation in the  xxxg874xxx  have elevated glucagon
levels, with pancreas and islets significantly enlarged, and
massive alpha cell hyperplasia [29, 30]. these findings are
similar to those in mice treated with  xxxg874xxx 
antisense oligonucleotide inhibitors, which also resulted in

this study demonstrates that  xxxg874xxx  antagonism
using a specific gra, nnc 25-0926, improves glycaemia
and increases insulin secretion, resulting in improved
glucose tolerance in female mice with hfd-induced insulin
resistance. previous data have shown that this compound
specifically inhibits glucagon binding to cloned human
glucagon receptors expressed in baby hamster kidney cells
with an ic50 value of 12 nmol/l (e. nishimura and u. g.
sidelmann, unpublished observations) and blocks glucagon-stimulated hepatic glucose output in dogs [40].
our study demonstrates that  xxxg874xxx  antagonism improves gsis, which was evident under in vivo

isolated from nd-veh (white bars), hfd-veh (black bars) and
hfd-gra (grey bars) mice after once daily gavage treatment for 24–
30 days. data are presented as mean ± sem from three independent
experiments where each condition was run in quadruplicate

alpha cell hypertrophy, hyperplasia and hyperglucagonaemia, although to a less pronounced degree than in glucagon
receptor knockout mice [28]. hyperglucagonaemia has
been observed in other studies using other gras [26].
the reason for this compensatory increase in the levels of
glucagon after inhibition of glucagon signalling is currently
not known. one possibility is that inhibition of glucagon
signalling in the alpha cell may disrupt an autocrine

negative feedback signal on glucagon secretion, which
may augment glucagon secretion in response to secretagogues. in contrast, insulin expression was maintained
during  xxxg874xxx  antagonism, with similar immunostaining and with no difference in islets content compared with nd-fed mice or hfd-fed control mice.
although inhibition of the glucagon signal results in
increased alpha cell mass, there has been no evidence of
neoplastic formations in the pancreas after disruption of the
glucagon signal [28, 29]. also in the present study, up to
30 days of gra treatment did not cause any apparent
damage to islets, with no apparent apoptotic effect of the
compound, as evidenced by the fact that  xxxg341xxx /7
activity, which is increased when apoptotic pathways are
activated [45], was similar in the three treatment groups.
the reduction of glucose levels by gra is consistent
with other studies where glucagon signalling was inhibited,
either through administration of gra [25, 46], neutralising
glucagon antibodies [18–20], or disruption of glucagon
receptor expression [27–30]. in our study, improved
glycaemia was not accompanied by elevated basal insulin
levels. furthermore, the results from the ogtt suggest that
the demand for insulin was reduced in hfd-gra-treated
mice, since glucose excursions were improved despite
lower insulin levels. together with the results from the
clamp study, this suggests that gra treatment leads to
improved insulin sensitivity. it remains to be established
whether the improved insulin sensitivity depends on hepatic
or extra-hepatic effects.  xxxg874xxx  antagonists may
also reduce glucose through inhibition of hepatic glucose
production [25, 40].
the use of  xxxg874xxx  antagonism as a possible
treatment of type 2 diabetes is tempting due to glucagon’s
role in maintaining plasma glucose levels and the fact that
patients with type 2 diabetes exhibit elevated fasting
glucagon levels, which contribute to their hyperglycaemia
[8, 9, 11]. the current treatment modalities for type 2
diabetes do not take increased glucagon levels into account
and new drugs need to be developed to tackle this issue.
inhibition of glucagon signalling has, in several studies

using several different techniques, been demonstrated to
potently reduce glycaemia [18, 26, 28, 29]. one concern
with this strategy is the risk of hypoglycaemia. however,
no studies have observed this phenomenon, except in
overnight-fasted mice lacking glucagon receptors, which
is an extreme animal model with complete block of the
glucagon signal [29]. however, the use of gras with long
duration of action might not be feasible, whereas antagonists whose action is of shorter duration may possibly
minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia. another concern with
 xxxg874xxx  antagonism is the alpha cell hyperplasia
that has been observed in all models where glucagon
signalling was inhibited. it is, however, possible that one
effect of alpha cell hyperplasia is increased islet glp-1
production, which then would be an important mechanism
contributing to increased insulin secretion [6].
in conclusion, this study demonstrates that glucagon
receptor antagonism, through a small glucagon receptorbinding molecule, efficiently increases gsis in mice with
hfd-induced insulin resistance in association with increased glucose sensitivity in the islet beta cells. glucagon
receptor antagonism also increases glucagon secretion and
results in increased alpha cell mass. overall glucagon
receptor antagonism reduces basal glucose and normalises
glucose tolerance. the results encourage further exploration
of the feasibility of glucagon antagonism as a potential
treatment for type 2 diabetes.
