abstract
exposure of arsenite can induce hyperproliferation of skin cells, which is believed to play important roles
in arsenite-induced carcinogenesis by affecting both promotion and progression stages. however, the signal pathways and
target genes activated by arsenite exposure responsible for the proliferation remain to be defined. in the present study, we
found that: (1) exposure of human keratinocytic hacat cells to arsenite caused an increase in cell proliferation, which
was significantly inhibited by pretreatment of  xxxd3536xxx , a specific chemical inhibitor of pi-3k/akt signal pathway;
(2) arsenite exposure was also able to activate pi-3k/akt signal pathway, which thereby induced the elevation of cyclin
d1 expression level in both hacat cells and human primary keratinocytes based on that inhibition of pi-3k/akt pathway
by either pretreatment of  xxxd3536xxx  or the transfection of their dominant mutants, significantly inhibited  xxxg366xxx 
expression upon arsenite exposure; (3) pi-3k/akt pathway is implicated in arsenite-induced proliferation of hacat cells
through the induction of  xxxg366xxx  because either knockdown of  xxxg366xxx  by its sirna or inhibition of pi-3k/akt signal
pathway by their dominant mutants markedly impaired the proliferation of hacat cells induced by arsenite exposure.
taken together, we provide the direct evidence that pi-3k/akt pathway plays a role in the regulation of cell proliferation
through the induction of  xxxg366xxx  in human keratinocytes upon arsenite treatment. given the importance of aberrant
cell proliferation in cell transformation, we propose that the activation of pi-3k/akt pathway and  xxxg366xxx  induction may
be the important mediators of human skin carcinogenic effect of arsenite. j. cell. biochem. 101: 969–978, 2007.

in turn causes skin hyperpigmentation and
hyperkeratosis, the hallmark signs of chronic
arsenite exposure [centeno et al., 2002; yu
et al., 2006]. these skin lesions can further
develop into skin cancers, including bowen’s
disease (carcinoma in situ), basal cell carcinoma
(bcc) and squamous cell carcinoma (scc)
[tseng et al., 1968; yu et al., 2006].
the mouse multistage skin carcinogenic
model has demonstrated that cancer development results from a synergism between genotoxic and nongenotoxic factors [hecker, 1987;
zoumpourlis et al., 2003; shi et al., 2004; wei
et al., 2005]. the former induces irreversible
genetic alterations (tumor initiation), whereas
the latter promotes tumor development by
favoring the clonal outgrowth of the genetically
altered cells (tumor promotion) through activating cell survival and proliferation signal pathways and altering the machineries controlling

cell proliferation and apoptosis. it has been well
accepted that aberrant cell proliferation caused
by alterations in cell-cycle machinery at checkpoints is associated with tumor development
and progression [kastan and bartek, 2004;
massague, 2004; ohtani et al., 2004]. arsenite
has a weak mutagen effect, so it is thought that
the ability to activate some signaling pathways
and gene expression responsible for cell growth
may play a more important role in its carcinogenetic effect. in fact, arsenite has been
demonstrated to induce cell proliferation in
both cell culture model and animal model
[van wijk et al., 1993; germolec et al., 1996;
germolec et al., 1997; germolec et al., 1998;
simeonova et al., 2000; hamadeh et al.,
2002; burns et al., 2004; rossman et al., 2004].
in cell culture studies, arsenite increases cell
proliferation in human keratinocytes [germolec
et al., 1996; simeonova et al., 2000; hamadeh
et al., 2002] and enhances the mitogenic effect of
suboptimal serum concentrations on quiescent
c3h10t1/2 cells [van wijk et al., 1993]. in
animal studies, low doses of arsenite cause
hyperplasia in the urinary bladder epithelium
and in skin [germolec et al., 1997; germolec
et al., 1998; simeonova et al., 2000; burns et al.,
2004], and mice exposed to arsenite in drinking
water show an increased epidermal thickness
and an increased fraction of epidermal cells expressing  xxxg1681xxx  (pcna)
as comparison with control mice [rossman
et al., 2004]. moreover, the arsenical bowen’s
disease shows a proliferating characteristic.
hyperproliferation caused by arsenite exposure has been indicated to correlate with its
effect on signal pathway activation. although it
was reported that arsenic-induced cell proliferation was associated with mapks/ap-1 and
 xxxg1559xxx  activation [simeonova et al., 2000; liao
et al., 2004; luster and simeonova, 2004], the
signal pathways involved in arsenite-induced
cell proliferation remain to be extensively studied. phosphoinositide 3-kinase (pi-3k), heterodimers composed of catalytic and a regulatory
subunits [cantley, 2002; vivanco and sawyers,
2002], can be activated in cells exposed to diverse stimuli such as hormones, growth factors,
and extracellular stressors. upon activation,
pi-3k generates phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5trisphosphate (pip3), a lipid second messenger
essential for the translocation of akt to the
plasma membrane, where it is phosphorylated
and activated by phosphoinositide-dependent

kinase-1 [alessi et al., 1997; toker and cantley,
1997]. akt phosphorylates and regulates the
function of many cellular proteins involved in
processes of apoptosis and proliferation. pi-3k/
akt has been demonstrated to be an important
signaling pathway for cell survival and growth,
also play a pivotal role in tumorigenesis
[nicholson and anderson, 2002; samuels and
ericson, 2006]. previous studies have indicated
that activation of pi-3k/akt can lead to transactivation of ap-1 and  xxxg1559xxx  through phosphorylation of mapks [eder et al., 1998] and
ikk [hu et al., 1999; li et al., 1999; hu et al.,
2001; jeong et al., 2005; vandermoere et al.,
2005], respectively. in our previous study, we
found that arsenite exposure induced  xxxg1559xxx 
activation in mouse epidermal jb6 cl41 cells,
which was mediated by pi-3k/akt/ xxxg1159xxx  cascade [ouyang et al., 2006]. these lines of evidence
suggest that pi-3k/akt may be involved in
mediating the cell proliferation upon arsenite
exposure in human skin cells. to address this
question in this study, we employed human
keratinocytes as a cell model and demonstrated
that pi-3k/akt signal pathway was indeed
implicated in arsenite-induced cell proliferation
through the induction of  xxxg366xxx . this study
provides the first direct evidence that pi-3k/
akt pathway plays a role in arsenite-induced
human keratinocyte proliferation by induction
of  xxxg366xxx  expression. given the importance of
aberrant cell proliferation in carcinogenesis,
this study may provide molecular basis for prevention of arsenite-induced carcinogenesis by
targeting pi-3k/akt signal pathway and  xxxg366xxx .
materials and methods
reagents, plasmids, and adenovirus
fetal bovine serum (fbs) was purchased
from life technologies, inc. (gaithersburg,
md); dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium
(dmem) was from calbiochem (san diego,
ca); and sodium arsenite was purchased from
aldrich (milwaukee, wi). antibodies specific
targeting phospho-akt (thr308), phospho-akt
(ser473), akt, and  xxxg366xxx  were purchased
from cell signaling technology (berverly, ma).
antibody against  xxxg861xxx  was from abcam
(cambridge, ma). the cytomegalovirus-neo
vector plasmid, the dn-akt mutant plasmid
(sr-akt-t308a/s473a) and the dominant negative mutant pi-3k plasmid (dp85), were as
described previously [huang et al., 1996; huang

the role of pi-3k/akt/ xxxg366xxx  in arsenite-induced cell proliferation
et al., 1997; huang et al., 2001; li et al., 2004].
these dn-akt and dp85 constructs were
inserted into adeasy xl adenoviral vector
(stratagene, la jolla, ca) according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. the adenovirus
was produced and amplified by transfecting
the plasmids into hek 293 cells.
cell culture
human keratinocytic hacat cells were cultured in monolayers at 378c, 5% co2 using
dmem containing 10% fbs, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 25 mg of gentamicin/ml [ouyang
et al., 2005]. the cultures were dissociated with
trypsin and transferred to new 75-cm2 culture
flasks (fisher, pittsburgh, pa) from one to three
times a week. normal human embryo keratinocytes (nheks) were purchased from cambrex
(walkersville, ma), and cultured in keratinocyte growth medium (kgm) (cambrex, walkersville, ma) according to the instruction
provided by the manufacture.
construction of sirna vector
the specific small interference rna (sirna)
targeted human  xxxg366xxx  was designed with a
sirna converter on the web site of ambion, inc.
(austin, tx) according to the gene sequence in
genbank and guideline of sirna and synthesized by invitrogen (san diego, ca). the target
sequence was 50 -gttcatttccaatccgccc30 (bases 791–809 of nm053056.1). the sirna
sequence was controlled via blast search and
did not show any homology to other known
human genes. the sirna was inserted into
psuppressor vector and verified by dna
sequencing. the sirna vectors were designated
as sicyclin d1.
stable transfection
hacat cells were transfected with dp85, dnakt, and sicyclin d1 plasmids by nucleofection
with the nucleofectortm ii and nucleofector kit
v (amaxa biosystems, gaithersburg, md)
according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
briefly, 1  106 of hacat cells were resuspended
in 100 ml of nucleofectortm solution v, and then
mixed together with 1 mg of cmv-neo vector and
10 mg of plasmids of interest. the mixture was
electroporated with a program specifically modified for hacat cells. after the nucleofection,
the cells were immediately transferred from
the cuvette to a 6-well plate with prewarmed
medium. twenty-four hours after the nucleofec-

971

tion, the cells were cultured in complete dmem
medium containing 1 mg/ml of  xxxg418xxx  for 24–
28 days. the stable transfectants were identified by either measuring the blocking activity
of the relative kinase activation or by the
inhibitory effect of sirna on the expression
of its target gene. the stable transfectants,
hacat-dp85, hacat-dn-akt, and hacatsicyclin d1 were established and cultured in
 xxxg418xxx -free dmem for at least two passages
before each experiment.
phosphorylation assay for akt
cells (2  105) were cultured in each well of
6-well plates to 70–80% confluence with normal
culture medium. the cell culture medium was
replaced with 0.1% fbs dmem with 2 mm
l-glutamine and 25 mg of gentamicin and cultured for 45 h. the cells were incubated in serumfree dmem for 3–4 h at 378c. after arsenite
exposure, the cells were washed once with icecold pbs and then extracted with sds-sample
buffer. the cell extracts were separated on
polyacrylamide-sds gels, transferred, and
probed with one of the following antibodies,
including phospho-specific akt (thr308) antibody, phospho-specific akt (ser473) antibody,
and total akt antibody. the protein bands
specifically bound to primary antibodies were
detected using an anti-rabbit igg alkaline
phosphatase-linked secondary antibody and
an ecf western blotting system (amersham,
piscataway, nj) [ouyang et al., 2005; ouyang
et al., 2006].
 xxxg366xxx  expression assay
cells (2  105) were cultured in each well of
6-well plates to 90% confluence. after exposure
of cells to arsenite with or without the pretreatment of  xxxd3536xxx  for different times as
indicated in the figure legends, the cells were
washed once with ice-cold pbs and then
extracted with sds-sample buffer. the cell
extracts were separated on polyacrylamidesds gels, transferred, and probed with specific
antibodies against  xxxg366xxx  or b-actin, which
was used as a protein loading control. the
protein bands specifically bound to primary
antibodies were detected as described above.
cell proliferation assay
confluent monolayers of hacat cells were
trypsinized, and 1  103 of viable cells suspended in 100 ml dmem supplemented with

972

ouyang et al.

10% fbs were added to each well of 96-well
plates. the plates were incubated at 378c in
a humidified atmosphere of 5% co2. twelve
hours later, the cells were pretreated with
or without  xxxd3536xxx , and then exposed to
arsenite for the times as indicated. the exposed
cells were lysed with a 50 ml lysis buffer, and the
proliferation of the cells was measured using
celltiter- xxxg898xxx  luminescent cell viability
assay kit (promega, madison wi) with a
luminometer (wallac 1420 victor2 multipliable counter system) as described previously
[ouyang et al., 2006]. the results are expressed
as luciferase activity relative to control medium
(proliferation index).
results
inhibition of pi-3k/akt pathway down-regulates
arsenite-induced proliferation
of hacat cells
arsenite has been reported to be able to
induce cell proliferation both in cell culture
model and animal model [van wijk et al., 1993;
germolec et al., 1996; germolec et al., 1997;
germolec et al., 1998; simeonova et al.,
2000; hamadeh et al., 2002; burns et al.,
2004; rossman et al., 2004]. here, we found
that exposure of hacat cell, a nontumorigenesis

fig. 1. pretreatment of  xxxd3536xxx  inhibited arsenite-induced
human hacat keratinocyte proliferation. viable cells (1  103)
were seeded into each well of 96-well plates. after being cultured
at 378c in a humidified atmosphere of 5% co2 for 12 h, the cells
were exposed to 0.15 mm of arsenite for 72 h (a), or pretreated
with  xxxd3536xxx  for 1 h, and then exposed to arsenite for 72 h
(b). the proliferative rate of the cells was measured using

human keratinocyte cell line, to low concentrations of arsenite also caused a significant
increase in cell proliferation (fig. 1a). previous
studies have also indicated that pi-3k/akt
signal pathway plays a crucial role in eukaryotic
cells in the modulation of the expression of
genes involved in cell proliferation, survival,
and malignant transformation by activating a
set of transcription factors, including creb and
nfkb [krasilnikov, 2000; brunet et al., 2001].
in this study, we tested whether pi-3k/akt was
also required for arsenite-induced proliferation
of hacat cells by pretreatment of the hacat
cells with  xxxd3536xxx , a specific chemical pi3k/akt inhibitor. as shown in figure 1b, the
pretreatment of cells with  xxxd3536xxx  did
markedly inhibit the cell proliferation induced
by arsenite exposure, indicating that low concentration of arsenite is able to induce human
keratinocyte proliferation through pi-3k/akt
signal pathway.
pi-3k-akt pathway is involved in  xxxg366xxx 
induction in human keratinocytes
upon arsenite exposure
the cell proliferation is stringently controlled
by a set of proteins including cyclins. it has been
demonstrated that  xxxg366xxx  plays a crucial role
in controlling cell proliferation. our previous

the role of pi-3k/akt/ xxxg366xxx  in arsenite-induced cell proliferation

973

study indicated that arsenite can induces cyclin
d1 in hacat cell [ouyang et al., 2005], and that
pi-3k/akt pathway is also reported to regulate
 xxxg366xxx  level in mouse epidermal jb6 cells
[ouyang et al., 2006]. thus, we examined the
induction of  xxxg366xxx  and the potential contribution of pi-3k/akt to its induction in human
keratinocytes exposed to low concentration of
arsenite. consistent with our previous results,
low concentration of arsenite was able to induce
 xxxg366xxx  expression (fig. 2a). further, pretreatment of  xxxd3536xxx  could markedly inhibit the  xxxg366xxx  induction by arsenite in hacat
cells (fig. 2b), suggesting that  xxxg366xxx  induction requires pi-3k/akt activation. to further
provide direct evidence for the contribution of
pi-3k/akt to  xxxg366xxx  induction in arsenite
exposure, we established hacat cells stably
transfected with dominant negative mutant of
pi-3k (dp85) and dominant negative mutant of
akt (dn-akt), and then examined the phosphorylation of akt. as shown in figure 2c, the
exposure of hacat cells to low concentrations of
arsenite was able to induce akt phosphorylation, which was inhibited by the transfection of
dp85, the dominant negative mutant of regulat-

ing subunit of pi-3k. more importantly, the
induction of  xxxg366xxx  by arsenite was also
significantly impaired in both dp85- and dnakt-transfected hacat cells (fig. 2d), which
is consistent with their inhibitory effect on
arsenite-induced akt phosphorylation (fig. 2c).
the requirement of pi-3k/akt pathway for
arsenite-induced  xxxg366xxx  expression was
further verified in human primary keratinocytes (nheks). as shown in figure 3a, exposure of nheks to low concentrations of arsenite
also induce  xxxg366xxx  accumulation, which was
markedly impaired in nheks infected with
adenovirus expressing either dn-pi-3k (dp85)
(fig. 3b and d) or dn-akt (fig. 3c and d). taken
together, these results demonstrate that activation of pi-3k/akt pathway is required for cyclin
d1 induction by arsenite in human keratinocytes.

concentrations of arsenite as indicated for 24 h (a), or pretreated
with 50 nm of  xxxd3536xxx  for 1 h, and then exposed to 0.3 mm of
arsenite for 24 h (b). (c, d) hacat-mock, hacat-dn-akt, and

was replaced with 0.1% fbs dmem. forty-five hours later, the
cells were incubated in serum-free dmem for 3–4 h, and then

exposed to various concentrations of arsenite as indicated for
12 h (c). the cells were exposed to various concentrations of
arsenite as indicated for 24 h (d). the cells were washed once
with ice-cold pbs and extracted with sds-sample buffer. the cell
extracts were separated on polyacrylamide–sds gels, transferred, and probed with specific antibodies as indicated. the
protein band specifically bound with the primary antibody was
detected by using anti-rabbit igg–ap-linked secondary antibody
and an ecf western blot system.  xxxg861xxx  was used as a control
for protein loading.

nheks (2  105) were seeded into each well of 6-well plates,
cultured at 378c overnight, and then infected by adenovirus
expressing dn-akt or dp85 for 36 h. the infected cells were

extracted with sds-sample buffer for western blot assay as
described in ‘‘materials and methods’’ to detect the expression of
dn-akt (b) or dp85 (c), or exposed to various concentrations of
arsenite as indicated for 24 or 48 h (d). the cells were then
washed once with ice-cold pbs and extracted with sds-sample
buffer. the cell extracts were analyzed by western blot to detect
 xxxg366xxx  expression level.  xxxg861xxx  was used as a control for
protein loading.

progression, there is still no direct evidence to
show the involvement of  xxxg366xxx  in arseniteinduced cell proliferation. to examine whether
the induction of  xxxg366xxx  is responsible for
pi-3k/akt-mediated hacat cell proliferation by
low concentrations of arsenite, we established
 xxxg366xxx  specific small interference rnatransfected hacat cells. western blot assay
indicated that the sirna markedly impaired
 xxxg366xxx  expression in hacat cells (fig. 4a).
moreover, the transfection of  xxxg366xxx  sirna
dramatically inhibited hacat cell proliferation
induced by arenite (fig. 4b). these results
provided the direct evidence to indicate the
importance of  xxxg366xxx  in arsenite-induced
proliferation of hacat cells. consistent with the
role of pi-3k/akt in the induction of  xxxg366xxx 
in hacat cells exposed to arsenite, the hacat
cell proliferation induced by arenite was also
blocked by transfection of either dp85 or dnakt (fig. 4c and d). collectively, these results
demonstrate that pi-3k/akt pathway plays a
pivotal role in arsenite-induced proliferation of
human keratinotyes through the induction of
 xxxg366xxx .

discussion
since arsenite, a well-documented human
carcinogen, has only a weak mutagen effect,
it is believed that its ability to activate some
signaling pathways and gene expression
responsible for cell growth may play an important role in mediating its carcinogenetic effect.
in the present study, we demonstrate that the
exposure of human keratinocytes to low concentration of arsenite leads to the activation of
pi-3k/akt, which thereby plays a critical role in
arsenite-induced cell proliferation through inducing  xxxg366xxx  expression. inhibition of pi-3k/
akt dramatically blocked arsenite-induced cyclin
d1 induction and cell proliferation in human
keratinocytes.
pi-3k/akt signaling pathway has been
demonstrated to play a role in cell survival
and growth, and be involved in the tumorigenesis under some context. one means by which
pi-3k/akt regulates the cell proliferation is
to upregulate the level of  xxxg366xxx  at both
transcription and protein levels [cappellini
et al., 2003; liang and slingerland, 2003].

ouyang et al.

the transcription of  xxxg366xxx  is regulated by
multiple transcription factors including ap-1
[watanabe et al., 1996; lee et al., 1999] and
 xxxg1559xxx  [guttridge et al., 1999; hinz et al., 1999;
joyce et al., 1999; krasilnikov, 2000; see et al.,
2004]. ap-1 and  xxxg1559xxx  are activated by mapks
and ikk signal cascades, respectively. interestingly, both mapks [eder et al., 1998] and ikk
[hu et al., 1999; li et al., 1999; hu et al., 2001;
jeong et al., 2005; vandermoere et al., 2005]
were reported to be activated by arsenite, and to
be the downstream of pi-3k/akt signal cascade
under certain context. presumably, activation
of these transcription factors through mapks
and ikk may be partially responsible for the
induction of  xxxg366xxx  and proliferation of
human keratinocytes exposed to low concentrations of arsenite.
in the multistage carcinogenesis mouse skin
model, cell proliferation has been indicated to
promote tumor development by favoring the
clonal outgrowth of the genetically altered cells
(tumor promotion) [kastan and bartek, 2004;
massague, 2004; ohtani et al., 2004]. in this
study, we found that the exposure of low
concentration of arsenite-induced proliferation
of human keratinocyte, and that pi-3k/akt
pathway is involved in the promotion of the
proliferation through the induction of  xxxg366xxx .
both pi-3k/akt pathway chemical inhibitor,
and dominant negative mutants of pi-3k and
akt, markedly inhibited  xxxg366xxx  induction in
human keratinocytes exposed to arsenite. subsequently, the proliferation of human keratinocyte induced by arsenite was also impaired.
these results demonstrate that pi-3k/akt
pathway is implicated in arsenite-induced cell
proliferation through the induction of  xxxg366xxx .
as an important signal pathway for cell
survival and growth, pi-3k/akt has been
demonstrated to associate with the tumorigenesis [nicholson and anderson, 2002; samuels
and ericson, 2006]. more than 30% of various
solid tumor types were recently found to contain
mutations in  xxxg1745xxx , the catalytic subunit of
pi-3k [samuels and ericson, 2006]. in addition,
several studies have shown gene amplification
of pik3c in human ovarian cancer, cervical
cancer, head and neck cancer, gastric cancer,
and glioblastoma [osaki et al., 2004]. the pi3k/akt pathway has also been found dysregulated in skin related cancers such as melanomas. moreover, it has been reported that the
region of chromosome 3q26 containing the p110

catalytic subunit of pi3k is frequently amplified
in cancer of the ovary and cervix, leading to
overexpression and enhanced pi3k catalytic
activity [gavin, 2005]. considering the carcinogenic activity of arsenite, our present study
demonstrates that pi-3k/akt pathway contributes to arsenite-induced cell proliferation in
human keratinocytes. we therefore anticipate
that pi-3k/akt pathway may be involved in
arsenite human skin carcinogenic effect.
in summary, our studies demonstrate that
pi-3k/akt pathway plays a role in the arseniteinduced proliferation of human keratinocytes
through the induction of  xxxg366xxx . in light
of the important role of cell proliferation in
carcinogenesis, the pi-3k/akt may contribute
to arsenite-induced carcinogenesis through the
induction of  xxxg366xxx . these results provide
novel information for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the carcinogenic
effect of arsenite on its major target tissue of
skin, which also suggest that pi-3k/akt pathway may be a target for chemoprevention of
arsenite-induced carcinogenesis.
