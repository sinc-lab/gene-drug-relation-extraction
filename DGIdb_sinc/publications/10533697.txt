received september 28, 1998—final february 16, 1999
the rate and extent of binding of  xxxd2592xxx  to human erythrocytes was studied in vitro. all
experiments were carried out at physiological temperature (37c) and ph (7.4).  xxxd2592xxx 
(mtz) buffer concentrations were analyzed by hplc. distributional equilibrium between buffer
and washed red blood cells was achieved after 1 hr. results of equilibrium studies were consistent
with two classes of binding sites for mtz within the erythrocyte: a low affinity, high capacity
site ( xxxg287xxx ) and a high affinity, low capacity site ( xxxg293xxx ). a two-binding site model was fitted
to experimental data generating estimates for binding parameters  xxxg961xxx  (0.0017 ±0.00022 um-1)
nm1 (636 ± 5.23 u m ) , ka2(0.46±0.0083 um-1), and nm2(80.9±0.389 um). based upon these
findings, kinetic studies were performed in order to characterize the rate of drug distribution. the
rate of erythrocyte uptake of mtz was mathematically modeled using a series of differential
equations describing drug diffusion across the red blood cell membrane and subsequent complexation with intracellular binding sites. the model assumed that penetration of mtz into the
red blood cells was passive but drug binding to the carbonic anhydrase isozymes was not instantaneous. using a novel curve fitting technique, parameter estimates of rbc membrane permeability (0.0102 ±0.000618 cm/min), and binding rate constants k -1 (0.254 ±0.0213min -1 ), k1
(0.0022 +0.00020 ml/ug-min), k -2 (1.59±0.0358min -1 ), and k2(3.1 ±0.035 ml/ug-min) were
obtained. the model characterized the observed biphasic decline of mtz buffer concentrations
over time and may help explain the prolonged residence of mtz in vivo.

introduction
 xxxd2592xxx  (mtz) is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (cai) used
clinically for the management of glaucoma (1). carbonic anhydrase (ca) is
a family of enzymes which catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide. a total of seven carbonic anhydrase isozymes have been identified in

man ( xxxg287xxx  through  xxxg299xxx ). these isozymes vary in activity, tissue specificity, and physiological roles (2,3). although found predominantly in the
erythrocytes, ca has also been identified in the kidney, brain, lung, and
bone. kinetic differences among individual isozymes have been observed
in animal models. collectively, these isozymes are likely to influence the
pharmacokinetic disposition of cais in vivo.
in a previous study, we investigated the blood and urinary disposition
of mtz following oral administration to healthy human subjects. the
results of this study indicated that mtz has a long elimination half-life in
the blood, evidence of strong binding to erythrocytes (4). the extensive red
blood cell (rbc) distribution of this compound was attributed to the two
carbonic anhydrase isozymes present within the rbc (5-8): a low affinity,
high capacity enzyme ( xxxg287xxx ) and a high affinity, low capacity isozyme ( xxxg293xxx ). the differential binding of mtz between these two enzymes is a principal determinant of the drug's prolonged residence time in vivo.
two recent review papers emphasize the vital role of the erythrocytes
in the transport and disposition kinetics of drugs in the blood (9,10). in
most pharmacokinetic situations, the erythrocytes are often regarded as an
insignificant compartment of drug distribution. however, for those compounds which accumulate in the erythrocytes to an appreciable extent,
characterization of different kinetic events occurring within the erythrocyte
might provide significant information on the drug disposition.
in the present investigation, the rate and extent of mtz distribution
into human erythrocytes was studied in vitro. a mathematical model for the
distribution of mtz into erythrocytes is proposed which may help explain
the in vivo behavior of this compound.
methods
materials
mtz was purchased from sigma chemical company (st. louis, mo).
solvents used for extraction and chromatography were obtained from vwr
scientific products (south plainfield, nj). all other chemicals for this study
were obtained from sigma chemical company.
preparation of erythrocytes suspension

human blood was purchased from new york blood center (new
york, ny). blood was centrifuged and the plasma and buffy coat discarded.
the remaining  xxxd187xxx  were then washed three times with iso-osmotic
buffer with ph7.4 (11). the buffer consisted of the following: nacl
(25 mm), kc1 (4.8 mm),  xxxd2534xxx  (1.2 mm), nah2po4 (50 mm), and glucose

(86 mm). cells were then resuspended in the same buffered medium, and
the hematocrit adjusted to 0.50.
equilibrium studies

all experiments were carried out at physiological temperature (37c)
and ph (7.4). to determine the extent of intracellular drug binding, equilibrium studies were performed using erythrocyte suspensions described above.
suspensions were allowed to equilibrate for 1 hr in a shaker bath. 1-ml aliquots of these suspended cells were then spiked with drug (concentration
range 5 to 500ug/ml). preliminary studies determined that distributional
equilibrium between buffer and cells was achieved after 1 hr (unpublished
data). therefore, a 500 ul sample was collected 1 hr following addition of
drug and centrifuged (vwr microcentrifuge) for 1 min (10,000 rpm). a
250 ul aliquot of the supernatant (buffer) was removed and then stored
frozen at -10c until analysis. preliminary studies found no evidence of nonspecific binding or adsorption of drug to the sampling tubes.
kinetic studies

in addition to equilibrium experiments, kinetic studies were conducted
to characterize the rate of approach to equilibrium. drug was added to
1-ml aliquots of suspended cells (37c, ph7.4) and samples (500ul) were
collected at predetermined intervals (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45,
and 60 min) over a 1-hr period. samples were centrifuged and stored as
described previously. experiments were conducted at four initial mtz concentrations: 7.5, 10, 25, and 40ug/ml.
drug analysis

mtz buffer concentrations were determined by hplc (12). the hplc
system consisted of a thermo separation products pi000 constant flow
pump and a uv1000 ultraviolet detector (thermo separation products,
riviera fl). output from the detector was processed using an ibm p75
personal computer with pc 1000 integration software (thermo separation
products). separation was accomplished with an altima 4.6 x 250 cm c-18,
5 um reverse-phase column (alltech associates, deerfield, il) and a mobile
phase consisting of 0.05 m sodium acetate buffer (ph 4.0) and acetonitrile
(20%). mobile phase flow rate was 1 ml/min and the detection wavelength
was 285nm. samples (20ul) were injected directly into the system (no
extraction step was performed). the method was validated in buffer and the
coefficient of variation of the method was less than 2%. the limit of
quantitation was 0.1 ug/ml. mtz red blood cell concentrations (crbc) were

estimated from the following formula:

results and discussion
equilibrium studies
uptake of mtz by the erythrocytes is concentration dependent. at
distributional equilibrium, the free drug concentration inside the erythrocyte
(crbc,f) was assumed to be equivalent to cb (assuming no binding of drug
within buffer). consequently, the concentration of drug bound within the
erythrocyte (crbc,b) at equilibrium was calculated as the difference between
crbc and crbc,f. . the binding isotherm for mtz erythrocyte uptake is provided in fig. 1. binding models containing one or more classes of binding

sites were fitted to experimental data using nonlinear regression analysis
(pcnonlin®, sci, palo alto, ca). mtz binding within the erythrocyte
was best described by a model that contained two classes of binding sites:
a high affinity site and a low affinity site. these sites presumably represent
the two carbonic anhydrase isozymes present in the rbc ( xxxg287xxx  and  xxxg293xxx ). the following equation was fitted to experimental data:

where ka and nm represent the affinity constant and maximum binding
capacity, respectively, for each isozyme (denoted 1 and 2). goodness of fit
of the model to experimental data was confirmed through randomness of
scatter of residuals, coefficient of variation of final parameters estimates,
and 95% confidence intervals. in comparison to a single-site binding model,
there was a reduction in weighted sum of squares error (lower aic value)
and better fit with the more complex model. model estimates of erythrocyte
binding parameters are provided in table i.
the results of the equilibrium studies parallel previous reports of mtz
disposition in vivo. in these studies, mtz distribution was consistent with
a two-binding site model for erythrocyte uptake (4,13,14), the two binding
sites representing isozymes of carbonic anhydrase:  xxxg287xxx  and  xxxg293xxx .  xxxg287xxx 
has been identified as a low affinity, high capacity site whereas  xxxg293xxx  is a
high affinity low capacity site (6). similarly, a two-binding site model has
been applied to other cais such as acetazolamide (8) and  xxxd1931xxx  (15).
the differential binding of mtz between the two ca isozymes is presumably responsible for observed dose disproportionality of plasma and
blood drug concentrations as well as a prolonged blood elimination halflife of mtz in human studies. pradhan et al. (13) suggest that at low doses

50

iyer, bellantone, and taft

of mtz (less than 50 mg), the preferential binding of mtz to  xxxg293xxx  (high
affinity) in the erythrocyte results in a very little drug remaining in the
plasma. however, at doses greater than 100mg,  xxxg293xxx  becomes saturated,
and the effects of drug binding to  xxxg287xxx  on drug distribution become more
important. since  xxxg287xxx  is a low affinity enzyme, however, more drug is available to distribute into plasma, resulting in a disproportionate increase in
plasma concentrations of drug. likewise, we have suggested that the prolonged residence of mtz in blood is due to a strong interaction with  xxxg293xxx . studying mtz disposition following a 1.5mg/kg oral dose to human
subjects (4), an apparent loss of distributional equilibrium between blood
and plasma was noted 24 hr after dosage administration. whereas plasma
concentrations declined with an apparent half-life of 14hr, blood concentrations remained almost constant over the duration of the study (estimated
blood t1/2~126hr). bayne et al. (14) reported that the half-life of mtz in
the erythrocytes is 15 days, consistent with our findings. the differential
binding of mtz between the two isozymes apparently resulted in two distinct phases of elimination. the first elimination phase, occurring at earlier
time periods involves the low affinity  xxxg287xxx  isozyme. being the predominant
isozyme in the erythrocyte, distributional equilibrium within the blood is
maintained while bound drug concentrations in the erythrocyte are relatively high. as these levels decline, however, complexation with  xxxg293xxx 
eventually becomes the rate-limiting step to redistribution of drug into
plasma. due to the strong binding of mtz to  xxxg293xxx , a second elimination
phase is established where rbc concentrations of mtz declined very slowly
relative to plasma levels, resulting in long blood half-life of drug.
bayne et al. (14) reported evidence of two erythrocyte binding sites for
mtz following oral administration of drug to a human subject. a rosenthai plot (bound/free vs. bound rbc concentrations) was constructed and
the binding parameters were calculated. estimates of maximum binding
capacity (nm1 = 165um, nm2 = 18um) reported by bayne et al. are significantly lower than those obtained in the present investigation (table i). the
total concentration of carbonic anhydrase (both  xxxg287xxx  and  xxxg293xxx ) in the
erythrocytes is 156um (6). coleman (16) has suggested that drug binds to
the carbonic anhydrase enzyme in a 1:1 ratio. although bayne et al. (14)
estimates of maximum binding capacity are consistent with a 1:1 complexation between mtz and enzyme, the disparity from our results may be
reflective of differences in calculation. in estimating the unbound concentration of drug in the erythrocyte, bayne et al. assumed that the free fraction
of drug in the plasma to be 0.45. previously, we have determined this estimate to be 0.28, based on ultrafiltration binding experiments (4). using the
higher estimate of free fraction would be expected to influence estimates
of nm. furthermore, peak rbc concentrations in our study subjects were

in vitro erythrocyte distribution of  xxxd2592xxx 

51

approximately 400 um (4), consistent with our equilibrium experiments.
this suggests that more than one molecule of drug may be capable of binding to each enzyme and that the binding capacity of mtz within the
erythrocyte may be greater than previously thought. binding experiments
between mtz and individual ca isozymes should be performed to confirm
these results.
kinetic studies

an interesting finding of the in vitro equilibrium studies was that distributional equilibrium between the buffer and erythrocyte was not reached
immediately upon addition of drug. wallace and riegelman (17) reported
similar results with acz distribution in whole blood in vitro, where equilibration of drug between plasma and erythrocytes was established after
40 min. in vivo peak rbc concentrations of acz are measured 1 to 2 hr
after peak plasma levels. the authors attribute this lag time to the equilibration tune (17). in the present investigation, kinetic experiments were performed to characterize the rate of approach to equilibrium for mtz
distribution into the rbcs.
models for erythrocyte distribution of cais have been forwarded by a
number of investigators. holder and hayes (18) proposed the diffusion of
sulfonamide drugs into the rbcs to be a passive process. bayne et al. (8)
characterized erythrocyte binding of acz to two classes of sites. sweeney
et al., (19) modeled acz binding to plasma albumin and carbonic anhydrase
in a physiological system. in each of these studies, however, it was assumed
that complexation between drug and enzyme is instantaneous. in the present
study, a novel model incorporating the effect of transport and kinetics is
presented which describes the rapid penetration of drug into the erythrocyte
and subsequent binding with two classes of ca isozymes (denoted e1 and
e2), a phenomenon that was assumed to be a noninstantaneous process.
a physical model for the transport and binding kinetics of mtz into
human erythrocytes
a schematic representation of the model is provided in fig. 2. the
model describes the rapid penetration of mtz across the rbc membrane
and subsequent binding to two different isozymes of carbonic anhydrase
inside the cell. while membrane transport is assumed to be a relatively fast
process, the model describes the intracellular binding of the drug to isozymes  xxxg287xxx  and  xxxg293xxx  as a function of time.  xxxg287xxx  is a polymer composed
of a single promoter whereas  xxxg293xxx  contains three different polymers composed of two distinct promoters. thus, ca isozymes in the human erythrocyte possess structural and functional differences that could lead to
noninstantaneous binding of drug within the cell.

surface binding of mtz on the erythrocyte was assumed to be negligible. attempts were made to identify any surface binding of mtz by performing equilibrium studies with rbcs suspended in media of varying
tonicities (0.6 to 2g% nacl), since binding might be expected to change
secondary to perturbations in the size and shape of the erythrocyte. no
differences in mtz binding parameters were noted among suspensions
using hypotonic (0.6% nacl), isotonic (0.9% nacl), and hypertonic (2%
nacl) media. however, since the area of the erythrocyte membrane may
not change significantly in media of various tonicities despite changes in cell
size and shape, the possibility of surface binding cannot be ruled out based
solely on these preliminary experiments. nevertheless, binding of cais to
the erythrocyte membrane has not been reported previously in the literature.
the migration of mtz in solution into or out of the erythrocyte is a
problem of diffusion, so that fick's law, which describes that the rate of
diffusion across a membrane, should apply. fick's first law applies
because it is assumed that the rbc membrane is very thin, thereby establishing a nearly linear concentration gradient across the membrane (20). if
the suspension medium is well stirred, the rate of disappearance of drug
from the buffer can be described as follows:

where a represents the total membrane surface area of all rbcs in the
system, vb is the volume of buffer and p is the permeability.
an additional assumption of the model is that the intracellular
diffusion of mtz within the erythrocyte was very rapid relative to the

in vitro erythrocyte distribution of  xxxd2592xxx 

53

experimental sampling time. in consideration of the average diffusion coefficient in an aqueous environment (~10-5-10-6cm2/sec) and the radius of a
red blood cell, 4 um (21), this assumption seems valid. from fig. 2, therefore, the differential equation for crbc,f can be expressed as

where e1 and e2 represent the concentration of available isoenzymes  xxxg287xxx 
and  xxxg293xxx , respectively. ec1 and ec2 denote the concentrations of mtz
bound to those isozymes. p* is a composite parameter defined as follows:

in the present studies vrbc and vb are equal (hct= 0.5). thus the ratio (ap/
vb) could replace p* in our analysis. however, the model equations presented are a general application irrespective of the relative volumes of rbc
and buffer.
assuming that the total enzyme concentration (et) equals the sum of
bound and free enzymes

describing the relationships in eq. (6) in terms of e1 and e2 and substituting
into eq. (4) yields

similarly, equations describing the rate of change of ec1 and ec2 can be
written as

equations (8) and (9) represent the time-dependent aspect of the mtz
erythrocyte distribution. the present model deviates from earlier models in
that ec1 and ec2 are described as a function of time, not in terms of equilibrium constants (ka 1 , ka2), which describe drug complexation with the
ca isozymes when instantaneous binding is assumed. upon rearranging

of erythrocyte uptake. (mtz initial buffer concentration 10ug/ml).
[o= mean (sd) observed data; solid line was generated using curvefitting method described in text]

eq. (8), the following relationship is generated:

to integrate eq. (10), a limiting value was applied to crbc,f. according to
eq. (3), as dcb/dt approached zero, (cb - crbc,f) also approaches zero. from
fig. 3, the rate of change of cb becomes very small after 5 min, leading to
the assumption that cb is nearly constant after this time. likewise, crbc,f is
practically constant in this region as well [after 5 min, again by eq. (3)]. by
assuming crbc,f is nearly constant at longer experimental times, eq. (10) can
be integrated to yield

where t0 is chosen by inspection as any time after which crbc,f changes very
slowly (for t > t0) such that it is relatively constant (t0 = 5 min in the present

in vitro erythrocyte distribution of  xxxd2592xxx 

55

study). after applying the limits, this equation can be expressed as

similarly, ec2 can be described as

in eqs. (12) and (13), b1 and b2 represent integration constants, which
depend on the value chosen for t0. by substituting these relationships into
eq. (7) and expressing k\ and k2 in terms of equilibrium constants (ka 1 =
k 1 / k - 1 and ka 2 =k 2 /k - 2 ), the following expression can be used to characterize (dc rbc , f /dt):

equation (14) applies when t> t0. rearranging eq. (14) and expressing the
equation in terms of natural logarithms will generate the following equation
to describe the physical model:

where

equation (15) describes the rate of change of crbc,f over time, where k-1
and k-2 are dissociation rate constants for drug complexation with the ca
isozymes.
curve fitting technique for estimation of model parameters
the rate of mtz uptake into the erythrocyte was estimated from the
rate of disappearance of drug from buffer at 37c and a hematocrit of 0.5.
a plot of mtz buffer concentrations vs. time is provided in fig. 3. studies
were conducted at four initial concentrations of drug in buffer (7.5, 10, 25,
and 40ug/ml). presented in fig. 3 are representative data (x + sd) from
the 10ug/ml treatment group. similar results were obtained with the other
treatment groups. in order to evaluate or estimate the constants from the

56

iyer, bellantone, and taft

physical model it was necessary to take derivatives using experimental data.
because data were collected at discrete time points, where even small experimental error can create large errors in estimating derivatives, it is therefore
necessary to represent the data (buffer concentrations over time) with an
arbitrary chosen function that is smooth and differentiable and provides a
good fit to the data. this function could then yield useful information (e.g.,
crbc,f) once differentiated. the purpose of curve-fitting the data was to represent the data in a manner that would allow rates to be measured accurately and reproducibly. in principle the form of the function should not
have affected estimates of the physical parameters provided that the chosen
function represents the data well. to analyze the experimental data, three
steps needed to be performed: (i) selection of a function to represent the
data and fit the function to the experimental data (c vs. time), (ii) generate
mathematical functions describing ctbc,f and [dc rbc,f /dt] vs. time, (iii) determine physical model parameter estimates from steps 1 and 2. each step is
discussed in detail.
step 1. the following function is chosen to represent the buffer concentration-time data:

the justification for choosing this function is described below. the initial
rapid uptake of the drug into the rbc was assumed to be the result of
passive diffusion of mtz from buffer (donor) into the red blood cell
(receiver) compartment. by applying fick's first law, eq. (3) is obtained

in the limit of time approaching zero (crbc,f= 0), this equation becomes

where c0b is the buffer concentration at time t = 0. upon integration of eq.
(17), the following relationship is generated:

this relationship is valid for small experimental times. therefore, at early
times, drug disappearance from the buffer was assumed to be a first-order
process, described using the following equation:

calculations; solid line was generated using curve-fitting approach).

as time approaches infinity, then cb = ci, the buffer concentration once
distributional equilibrium is reached. thus, f was estimated by the difference between cb°and ci. using a curve stripping method, a new series of
data points was generated when the initial rapid uptake data and equilibrium concentration (collectively termed c'b) were subtracted from the
observed data (cb) where

a representative plot of (cb - c'b) is provided in fig. 4. the shape of the
curve was adequately described using the following biexponential function:

at large experimental times, c'b~ci therefore, g and b can be estimated
from the intercept and slope, respectively, of a log-linear form of eq. (21).
overall, the eqs. (20) and (21) can be combined, producing eq. (16), a
formula that describes mtz buffer concentrations as a function of time.
equation (16) was fitted to experimental data using nonlinear regression

assuming that the rbc is spherical in shape, the following geometrical
measurements were used to estimate the total surface area of the erythrocytes (a): surface area per cell = 1.63 x 10-8cm2/cell and cell volume =
8.7x 10-11 cm3 (18). total surface area was calculated using the following

formula:

where 0.5cm3 represents the total rbc volume in the system. having
obtained a hypothetical function to describe cb and (dcb/dt), crbc,f can be
estimated through rearrangement of eq. (3). once completed, the curvefitting technique described in step 1 above was then applied to the crbc,f
data as a function of time, generating estimates of [dc rbc,f /dt] (unpublished
data).
step 3. the final step of this curve-fitting method was to generate a
representative plot of ln[dc rbc,f /dt - p*(cb - crbc,f)] vs. time, as presented in
fig. 5. the physical model predicts a biphasic mechanism of drug uptake
into the erythrocyte, which is consistent with the data. estimates of the
binding rate constants, k-1 and k-2 were obtained by applying eq. (15) to
the data presented in fig. 5. assuming k-2>>k-1, eq. (15) can be simplified

where the slope of the resultant graph equals [k-1 (1 + kat crbc,f)]. since  xxxg961xxx 
was estimated from equilibrium studies and assuming that at later times
(e.g., approaching equilibrium) crbc,f can be approximated by coo, k-1 can
be estimated from the slope. likewise, k-2 can be estimated by the method
of residuals, where eq. (25) is subtracted from eq. (15) yielding the following result:

the resultant slope of the residual curve is equal to [k_2(l + ka2crbc,f)],
from which k_2 can be readily estimated.
a summary of model parameter estimates across all study groups is
provided in table iii.
sensitivity analysis
to estimate the error in the physical model parameters, a sensitivity
analysis was performed. although in principle the physical estimates should
not be affected by the form of the curve-fitting function chosen [eq. (16)],
these estimates will be affected by the curve-fitting parameters. the sensitivity of the physical parameters (p, k-1, k_2) to perturbations in curvefitting parameters a, s, and b are detailed in fig. 6. values of the curvefitting parameters were varied over a range of ±100% from those estimates
reported in table ii, and the resultant change in each of the physical parameters was determined. sensitivity analysis was not performed for the other

three curve-fitting parameters (f, g, c i ) . since ci was directly determined
from equilibrium studies and f was calculated as the difference between
c°b and ci, the error in the estimates of these parameters was assumed to
be negligible. moreover, as seen in table iii, the values of each of these
three parameters were a function of the mtz concentration studied. consequently, they were excluded from the analysis.
a sensitivity analysis of this type not only supports the choice of the
curve-fitting equations but also provided insight into the relative degree of
precision of the physical parameter estimates. the error in the calculated
values of the physical parameters can be expressed in terms of the error in
the fitting parameters through a multivariable taylor series expansion, as
described by the following relationship:

where ai represents the slope obtained from sensitivity plots and dxi is the
coefficient of variation in each of the curve-fitting parameters (a, s, and b).
by represents the second-order coefficient from the taylor series expansion,

and so forth. when the error in each of the curve-fitting parameters is less
than 10%, higher order terms in the expansion can be neglected, and eq.
(27) simplifies to the following approximation using only the first-order
terms:

from table ii, the maximum error in any of the curve parameter estimates
was 9.25%. consequently, the error in each of the physical parameter estimates was determined though eq. (28). the results of the sensitivity analysis
are provided in table iv. the maximum error in a, b, and s was 5.08, 1.15,
and 7.73%, respectively. overall, the sensitivity analysis performed indicates
that physical model parameters have been estimated with a relatively high
degree of precision, much better than what would be expected using conventional pharmacokinetic data analysis tools such as simultaneous fitting of
eqs. (3) and (7)-(9) by nonlinear regression.
as mentioned previously, the results of this investigation indicate that
the erythrocyte distribution of mtz is a time-dependent process which can
be attributed to the noninstantaneous complexation between drug and ca
isozymes in the rbc ( xxxg287xxx  and  xxxg293xxx ). similar studies have been conducted previously with acz, the most commonly prescribed cai. although
wallace and riegelman (17) also observed delayed equilibration of drug
distribution between plasma and rbcs, other investigators assumed that
acz distribution occurred instantaneously (8,19). assuming drug rapidly
diffuses across the rbc membrane and within the rbc, enzyme binding is
the likely rate-limiting step for the uptake process of mtz. based upon the
estimates of binding parameters which were obtained from the kinetic studies (see table iii), it appears that the low affinity binding site is responsible

for the noninstantaneous distribution of mtz. this is illustrated in fig. 7,
a simulated plot of mtz concentrations in buffer and the erythrocyte
(crbc,f, ec 1 , and ec2) as a function of time as predicted by the physical
model (10ug/ml treatment group). shown in this figure is the rapid disappearance of drug from the buffer as drug rapidly diffuses across the erythrocyte (see fig. 2). drug in the erythrocyte would be expected to complex
rapidly with the high affinity site ( xxxg293xxx , denoted as ec2). however, this is
a low capacity site and cannot possibly account for all of the rapid sequestration of drug by the rbc. although the low affinity site (site i) complexes
drug more slowly, there are also a large number of available enzyme sites
(e 1 ) in the rbc. therefore, the low affinity site (site i) may initially be
capable of taking up some of the free drug in the erythrocyte during those
early experimental times, although this site will not fully equilibrate until
some time later, thereby resulting in the apparent noninstantaneous distribution of mtz. this is illustrated in fig. 7, where the concentrations ec1
rise slowly over time relative to ec2.
additionally, the results of this investigation are consistent with the
observed blood disposition of mtz in vivo. the prolonged residence of

in vitro erythrocyte distribution of  xxxd2592xxx 

65

mtz in blood relative to plasma has been attributed to strong binding
between drug and the high affinity  xxxg293xxx  enzyme within the rbcs.
although drug would be expected to equilibrate quickly with this isozyme
(as presumed in the uptake studies), release of drug from this site would be
slow due to the nature of the attraction of drug for the enzyme. release
studies of mtx from "drug loaded" erythrocytes are presently being conducted in the laboratory. preliminary results are consistent with the in vivo
blood disposition of this compound; that is, the release of drug from rbcs
into the suspending medium (buffer) under sink conditions is very prolonged (unpublished results) and can be correlated to the compound's long
elimination t1/2 in vivo.

conclusions
the findings of this investigation yield useful insight into the rate and
extent of mtz distribution into rbcs. drug uptake was consistent with
the existence of two binding sites within the erythrocyte, presumably the two
carbonic anhydrase isozymes in the rbc. moreover, the rate of erythrocyte
distribution was not instantaneous, an underlying assumption of rbc distribution models forwarded previously. a model of erythrocyte distribution
was developed which involved passive diffusion of drug into the rbc and
subsequent complexation to the two isozymes. using a novel curve-fitting
technique, estimates of model parameters were obtained which included a
permeability constant and binding rate constants. whereas mtz readily
permeated the rbc membrane, differences in drug complexation to the two
enzymes, one being of high affinity and the other of low affinity, explained
both the prolonged distribution of drug in vitro and the long elimination
t\/2 observed in vivo.
