abstract

selective  xxxg730xxx  modulators (serms) are structurally different
compounds that interact with intracellular estrogen receptors in target organs as
 xxxg730xxx  agonists and antagonists. these drugs have been intensively
studied over the past decade and have proven to be a highly versatile group for the
treatment of different conditions associated with aging, including hormoneresponsive cancer and osteoporosis. tamoxifen and  xxxd3402xxx  are currently used
to treat advanced breast cancer and also have beneficial effects on bone mineral
density and serum lipids in postmenopausal women. raloxifene is the only serm
approved worldwide for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and vertebral fractures. however, although these serms have many
benefits, they may also be responsible for some potentially very serious adverse
effects, such as thromboembolic disorders and, in the case of tamoxifen, uterine
cancer. these adverse effects represent a major concern given that long-term
therapy is required to prevent osteoporosis. moreover, both preclinical and
clinical reports suggest that tamoxifen,  xxxd3402xxx  and raloxifene are considerably
less potent than estrogen.
the search for the ‘ideal’ serm, which would have estrogenic effects on bone
and serum lipids, neutral effects on the uterus, and antiestrogenic effects on breast
tissue, but none of the adverse effects associated with current therapies, is
currently under way.  xxxd2798xxx , lasofoxifene,  xxxd289xxx  and arzoxifene,
which are new serm molecules with potential greater efficacy and potency than
previous serms, are currently under investigation for use in the treatment and
prevention of osteoporosis. these drugs have been shown to be comparably
effective to conventional hormone replacement therapy in animal models of
osteoporosis, with potential indications for an improved safety profile. clinical
efficacy data from ongoing phase iii trials are awaited so that a true understanding
of the therapeutic potential of these compounds can be obtained.

osteoporosis, which is defined as a skeletal disorder characterised by compromised bone strength
and increased risk of fracture, is the most prevalent
metabolic bone disease in developed countries.[1] its
clinical significance lies in the occurrence of fractures, involving most commonly the forearm, the
vertebral bodies and the hip, although fractures at
other sites may also be associated with the disease.
for caucasians, the lifetime risk of an osteoporotic
fracture at 50 years of age has been estimated to be
≈40% for women and 13% for men.[2] each year
>1.5 million people suffer hip, vertebral and wrist
fractures because of osteoporosis, a disease that can
be prevented and treated. the occurrence of osteoporotic fractures leads to considerable mortality,
morbidity, reduced mobility and decreased quality
of life.[3] moreover, the future risk of osteoporotic
fractures is greatly increased in patients with one or
more vertebral fractures.[4] recently, the annual
number of hip fractures in 15 countries of the eu
was estimated to be 500 000, with a total care cost of
≈€4.8 billion per year (1999 value).[5] this burden
will increase in absolute terms because of the aging
of the population. given the magnitude of the problem, the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis is,
therefore, of major importance for health organisations in all countries.
the major determinant of bone strength and osteoporotic fracture risk is bone mineral density
(bmd), as assessed by dual photon absorptiometry
or dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. according to
who criteria, osteoporosis exists when bmd values fall >2.5 standard deviations below the young
adult reference mean.[1] many studies have indicated
that the risk of fragility fractures increases progressively as bmd declines.[6-9] however, bone strength
depends not only on bmd. bone size as well as
bone quality are other important components that
interact with bmd to determine the risk of fracture.[1]
in women, osteoporosis and fractures occur
mainly as a consequence of estrogen deficiency after
menopause and result from an imbalance between
bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation
by osteoblasts, leading to a net bone loss with each

remodelling cycle. a decrease in estrogen production from androgen precursors has also been supposed to be a major cause of bone loss and osteoporosis in aging men.[10-12] the mechanism by which
estrogen affects bone metabolism is complex and
has not been fully elucidated. possible mechanisms
include a decrease in osteoclastogenesis, osteoclast
apoptosis and additional effects on calcium homeostasis.[10,13]
estrogen acts by binding to and activating the
 xxxg730xxx  (er). until recently, only one
form of er was known to exist.[14,15] with the discovery of a new form of the receptor, the  xxxg731xxx ,[16,17]
which is encoded by a different gene, the original
form has been now identified as  xxxg730xxx . while both
the ers bind estrogen as well as other agonists or
antagonists (albeit with different affinities), they
have distinctly different localisations and concentrations in several tissues, including bone.[18] in fact,
concentrations of  xxxg731xxx  are higher in developing cancellous bone, whereas concentrations of  xxxg730xxx  are
higher in developing cortical bone.[19] moreover,
target cells for estrogen action may contain varying
concentrations of homodimers of one or both ers,
as well as  xxxg730xxx  and  xxxg731xxx  heterodimers. structural
functional differences also exist between  xxxg730xxx  and
 xxxg731xxx , when complexed with estrogen, allowing for a
wide range of diverse actions to take place. thus, in
women, the decrease in estrogen production during
menopause has been associated with other nonskeletal complications, involving lipid metabolism,
and effects on the cardiovascular and nervous systems. decreasing levels of estrogen have been also
associated with menopausal vasomotor symptoms,
such as hot flashes, insomnia, nausea and vaginal
discharge or bleeding.
of the several therapeutic interventions for osteoporosis available, hormone replacement therapy
(hrt) has traditionally been seen as the gold standard method of preventing osteoporotic fractures in
postmenopausal women, and for managing menopausal symptoms. other potential benefits include
the treatment of vasomotor symptoms and prevention of colon cancer.[20,21] despite biologically plausible mechanisms for cardiac protection by estrogen
drugs aging 2007; 24 (5)

serms for postmenopausal osteoporosis

and observational studies indicating that hrt confers cardiovascular protection, the women’s health
initiative (whi) and other recent randomised, controlled trials have failed to confirm any potential
benefit in terms of reducing the risk of coronary
artery disease and stroke.[22,23] indeed, early increases in cardiac event and stroke rate have been
seen in women taking combination hrt. moreover,
hrt, especially if long-term, leads to an increased
risk of breast cancer and, when unopposed by
progestogens, endometrial cancer.[24] other adverse
effects often associated with hrt include fluid retention, breast pain, headache and resumption of the
menstrual cycle. thus, use of hrt now needs to be
regarded as a short-term therapy for menopausal
symptom management, with treatment individualised for each woman.[25] in contrast, estrogen therapy must be taken long-term, possibly lifelong, to
have any lasting impact on bone health. alternative
therapies for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis include bisphosphonates, calcitonin, vitamin
d, selective  xxxg730xxx  modulators (serms)
and  xxxg1885xxx .[26]
this article reviews the current status of serms
used in clinical medicine and new serms in development for the prevention and/or treatment of
postmenopausal osteoporosis.
1. selective  xxxg730xxx 
modulators (serms) in clinical use for
postmenopausal osteoporosis
serms are a class of compounds that can act as
er agonists in some tissues while acting as er
antagonists in others.[27] they include chemically
diverse molecules that lack the steroid structure of
estrogens (figure 1), but possess a tertiary structure
that allows them to bind to  xxxg730xxx  and/or  xxxg731xxx . most
of the unique pharmacology of serms as well as
their agonistic and antagonistic activities on estrogen target tissues can be explained by three main
interactive mechanisms:[28] (i) differential  xxxg730xxx  and
 xxxg731xxx  expression; (ii) differential er conformation
on ligand binding; and (iii) differential expression
and binding to the er of co-regulator proteins (coactivators or co-repressors). notably, several studies

363

have clearly demonstrated that binding by estradiol,
pure antiestrogen (i.e.  xxxd576xxx ) or different
serm compounds results in a unique er conformation for each ligand.[29-31]
because of their selective er agonist properties
in different target tissues, serms can be indicated
for the prevention or treatment of diseases caused by
estrogen deficiency, including osteoporosis, without
incurring most of the undesirable effects of estrogens. in addition, because of their selective er
antagonist properties in the breast, serms can also
be used to prevent or treat breast cancer, in which
er agonistic activity is undesirable.
currently there are two main chemical classes of
serms approved for clinical use (figure 1): the
triphenylethylene derivatives tamoxifen and
 xxxd3402xxx , which are used to treat breast cancer,
and raloxifene, a benzothiophene derivative indicated for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis.[27,32] all three of these serms also have
beneficial effects on serum lipids but are associated
with venous thromboembolism and hot flashes.[27,28,32] moreover, although tamoxifen may have
a positive effect on bone as well, the increased risk
of endometrial cancer with this agent eliminates it as
a possible therapy for postmenopausal osteoporosis.
the effects of raloxifene on bone are well established. clinical trials demonstrated that at a daily
dose of 60mg, raloxifene is effective in the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.[33-35] the more (multiple outcomes of
raloxifene evaluation) study included 7705
postmenopausal women who met who criteria for
osteoporosis based on low bmd or presence of
vertebral fractures.[35] after 3 years of treatment,
women in the raloxifene group had a significantly
reduced (by 30–50%) risk of vertebral fracture compared with women in the placebo group (relative
risk [rr] 0.59; 95% ci 0.50, 0.70). the risk for hip
or other non-vertebral fractures was not significantly reduced. a subsequent analysis of long-term skeletal effects of raloxifene in women from the core
(continuing outcomes relevant to evista) study
showed no overall effect of raloxifene on non-vertebral fracture risk.[36] in these studies, raloxifene also

serms for postmenopausal osteoporosis

decreased markers of bone turnover by 30–40%
after 1 year, and increased bmd at the lumbar spine
and femoral neck by 2–3% after 3 years.[33] at the
same dose (60 mg/day), raloxifene has also demonstrated efficacy for prevention of er-positive breast
cancer,[37-39] a neutral effect on the uterus and no
significant effect on the risk of primary coronary
events.[39] major adverse events included hot flashes, leg cramps, peripheral oedema and gallbladder
disease. furthermore, in different placebo-controlled studies, raloxifene treatment increased the
relative risks of venous thromboembolism and fatal
stroke.[33-39]
tamoxifen is a weak agonist on bone,[40-43] and in
a study of postmenopausal women, the gain in bmd
after 2 years of treatment with tamoxifen was
small.[44] moreover, half of this short-term increase
in bmd was lost after 5 years of treatment. women
at increased risk for breast cancer who enrolled in
the national surgical adjuvant breast and bowel
project breast cancer prevention trial of tamoxifen
were also monitored for fractures, although this was
a secondary endpoint.[45,46] the relative risk for osteoporotic fractures was significantly reduced after 5
and 7 years of treatment with tamoxifen 20 mg/day.
conversely, in a previous study of 1716 postmenopausal women at high risk of breast cancer,
tamoxifen treatment (30 mg/day) for 1 year increased the risk of hip fractures.[47]
from the limited available data,  xxxd3402xxx  appears to be a weaker bone agonist than tamoxifen. in
a 1 year study comparing tamoxifen and  xxxd3402xxx ,
tamoxifen therapy was associated with an increase
in bmd by 2% in the lumbar spine and 1% in the
femoral neck, while  xxxd3402xxx  showed no increase
in bmd in any of the tested areas.[48]
overall, both preclinical and clinical reports suggest that raloxifene and tamoxifen are considerably
less potent than estrogen in bone,[49,50] in part because of their lower bioavailability. their effect in
the prevention of hip fractures is still uncertain.
importantly, the benefits of these serms in reducing the risks of invasive breast cancer and vertebral
fracture should be weighed against the increased
risks of venous thromboembolism, fatal stroke and,

in the case of tamoxifen, uterine cancer. moreover,
up to 50% of women taking available serms for
different indications reported moderate or severe
vasomotor or gynaecological symptoms (especially
vaginal dryness and hot flashes) that could hinder
compliance. it is evident that there is a need for a
serm that has the desired tissue-specific estrogenic
and antiestrogenic actions but with minimal adverse
effects.
2. development of new serms
for osteoporosis
the search for the ‘ideal’ serm, with estrogenic
effects on bone and serum lipids, neutral effects on
the uterus and antiestrogenic effects on breast tissue,
but no increase in the risk of venous thromboembolism, is currently under way. additional benefits of
the ideal compound would be a neutral or positive
effect on cognition (particularly in regard to
alzheimer’s disease) and a positive action on the
cardiovascular system. among the different serm
compounds under investigation,  xxxd2798xxx , lasofoxifene,  xxxd289xxx  and arzoxifene (see figure 1)
have been shown to be as effective in animal models
of osteoporosis as conventional hrt and are now in
clinical phase ii/iii studies. because of their higher
in vitro and in vivo potency (table i), these compounds are expected to demonstrate antifracture efficacy at the hip level whilst retaining the
extraskeletal benefits (such as in the breast) obtained
with raloxifene. clinical investigation of other molecules with promising estrogenic effects on bone,
such as levormeloxifene, was recently discontinued
during the phase iii trial because of a significant
incidence of gynaecological adverse events.[51-53]

preclinical development for a potential application
in osteoporosis.[54,55]
2.1  xxxd2798xxx 

 xxxd2798xxx  (formerly named  xxxd2798xxx ) is a
novel serm that was initially developed for the
treatment of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. however, this agent also shows promise in the
prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.[32,56]  xxxd2798xxx  has been detected in the plasma of humans
and non-human primates and is a triphenylethylene
derivative structurally similar to tamoxifen and
 xxxd3402xxx  (and is indeed a known metabolite of
 xxxd3402xxx ). even though its structure displays only
limited variations with respect to tamoxifen and
 xxxd3402xxx  ( xxxd2798xxx  is a  xxxd2798xxx ), structure-activity relationship experiments showed that removal of the 2-(dimethylamino)ethoxy fragment of tamoxifen significantly reduced agonistic activity in the uterus, but not in bone
or the cardiovascular system.[57]  xxxd2798xxx  specifically binds to both ers, with a relative binding
affinity for  xxxg730xxx  that is slightly higher than that for
 xxxg731xxx  (0.8% vs 0.6%, respectively). both preclinical
and clinical data have shown that this drug has a
promising pharmacological profile, characterised by
positive effects on bone, serum lipids and breast
tissue but minimal effects on the uterus.[56]
in vitro studies in bone marrow cultures have
demonstrated that  xxxd2798xxx  exerts its estrogenlike effects in bone by enhancing osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, as indicated by increased
mineralisation and bone nodule formation; this
mechanism of action is similar to that of 17beta-estradiol and tamoxifen, but different to that of raloxifene.[58] the stimulatory effect on osteoblasts was
inhibited by the pure anti-estrogen compound
 xxxd2165xxx , suggesting an er-mediated mechanism.
in osteoclast cultures from neonatal rat bones,  xxxd2798xxx  did not induce osteoclast apoptosis when
administered at concentrations ranging from 10
pmol/l to 10 mumol/l.[59] this result was similar to
those obtained with 17beta-estradiol, but clearly differed from those obtained with raloxifene, which
strongly induced osteoclast apoptosis (even at 0.1

pmol/l). these results suggest that serms may
inhibit bone resorption by different mechanisms.
the in vivo effects of  xxxd2798xxx  on bone, in
comparison with those of estradiol and other
serms, have been extensively investigated in the
ovariectomised (ovx) rat model. overall,  xxxd2798xxx  treatment (1 and 10 mg/kg) prevented
ovx-induced bone loss and increased bone strength
at the femoral neck and the lumbar vertebrae, as
demonstrated by measuring resistance against torsion and compression, results that implied a possible
role for this compound in fracture prevention.[60] in
this model, the effect of the 10 mg/kg dose appeared
to be somewhat greater than that of the 1 mg/kg
dose. the agonistic effect of  xxxd2798xxx  on bone (at
10 mg/kg) was comparable to that of estradiol (at 50
mug/kg), raloxifene (3 mg/kg) and  xxxd1941xxx  (10
mg/kg).
importantly, no toxicity of  xxxd2798xxx  was reported in the preclinical literature.[60-62] in particular,
 xxxd2798xxx  at doses that efficiently prevent bone
loss was not associated with a significant uterotropic
effect, and indeed showed a weak antagonistic activity in the uterus, suggesting preservation of normal
endometrial and possibly vaginal epithelium.[60]
during in vivo experiments in immature rat uterus,
 xxxd2798xxx  was 200- to 1000-fold less potent as an
agonist than estrogen. however, estrogenic effects
at the uterus have been described at doses higher
than 10 mg/kg,[60] and the stimulatory effect of
 xxxd2798xxx  at 50 and 100 mg/kg was similar to that
obtained with 1 mg/kg of tamoxifen. unlike tamoxifen, which exerts part of its carcinogenic effects
through the formation of dna adducts, studies in
both rats and mice treated with different doses of
 xxxd2798xxx  (50–200 mg/kg) for at least 7 days clearly demonstrated that the drug does not result in dna
adducts, thus suggesting a lower carcinogenic potential.[60,62] moreover, these in vivo animal observations also demonstrated that  xxxd2798xxx  has a beneficial effect on serum cholesterol, similar to other
serm molecules such as tamoxifen,  xxxd3402xxx  and
raloxifene.[60]
seven clinical studies of  xxxd2798xxx  have been
completed thus far, including five phase i and two
drugs aging 2007; 24 (5)

serms for postmenopausal osteoporosis

phase ii trials.[63-70] in all trials,  xxxd2798xxx  was well
tolerated, with few patients experiencing adverse
effects. the most frequently reported was headache
(15.0% and 12.8% with  xxxd2798xxx  and placebo,
respectively). in phase i studies, there was no toxicity at doses significantly higher than those currently
used in phase ii/iii studies (single high doses of up
to 800mg in men and repeated daily doses of up to
200mg for 12 weeks in postmenopausal women).[63]
importantly, unlike its precursor, tamoxifen,  xxxd2798xxx  had only minor effects on the endometrium; these were similar to those seen with raloxifene.[65,66,69] potential benefits that  xxxd2798xxx  may
have over raloxifene and tamoxifen include its neutral or even positive effect on hot flashes and its er
agonist effect at the vagina, improving the symptoms of vaginal dryness. the latter effect has been
clearly demonstrated in phase i/ii trials[66,69] and
might represent an important benefit since ≈40% of
postmenopausal women, who are potential users of
serms, report vaginal dryness and other complications associated with urogenital atrophy (including
vaginal discharge and infections, recurrent urinary
tract infections and dyspareunia).
notwithstanding the positive preclinical results
of  xxxd2798xxx  seen in the ovx-mice model, longterm phase ii/iii studies specifically looking at the
bone-sparing effect of  xxxd2798xxx  are lacking, and
the true impact of the drug on the prevention of bone
loss and osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal
women remains unknown. available data from a
completed 3-month, phase ii, comparative study
( xxxd2798xxx  30, 60 or 90 mg/day vs raloxifene 60
mg/day) suggested beneficial effects of  xxxd2798xxx 
treatment on bone, as demonstrated by effects on
markers of bone resorption, which were comparable
to or even slightly more favourable than those seen
with raloxifene.[67] however, the results were inconsistent, probably because of the short treatment period and because the study population was comprised
of non-osteoporotic women. in the same study,[67]
both  xxxd2798xxx  and raloxifene were equally effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol
(ldl-c) levels. a similar phase ii trial in 159
healthy postmenopausal women indicated that os© 2007 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

367

pemifene treatment (30, 60 or 90 mg/day) for 3
months was effective in reducing bone turnover
markers versus placebo, with a dose-dependent effect being evident.[68]
more extensive and long-term studies are required to obtain a real understanding of the therapeutic potential of  xxxd2798xxx  in the treatment of
postmenopausal bone loss and prevention of osteoporotic fractures. in january 2006, the first phase iii
trial of  xxxd2798xxx  for vaginal atrophy as an initial
indication was initiated.[70] however, bone-related
parameters (i.e. bmd or bone markers) have not
been included as secondary endpoints.[71] since  xxxd2798xxx  is very similar to tamoxifen, it is also
being studied for its effects on breast tissue. both in
vitro and in vivo experimental data have indicated
that this compound, like raloxifene and  xxxd3402xxx ,
may have breast cancer chemopreventive activity,[60-62,72,73] but these observations still require
clinical validation.
2.2 lasofoxifene

lasofoxifene (cp-336,156) is a potent naphthalene-derivative, third-generation serm that is currently in phase iii development for the prevention
and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal
women.[74-76] this agent is structurally distinct from
the first- and second-generation serms raloxifene
(a benzothiophene derivative), tamoxifen and
clomiphene (both triphenylethylene derivatives) and
 xxxd2322xxx  (a pyrrolidine derivative).[77-79] lasofoxifene exerts significant estrogenic and anti-estrogenic activity both in vitro and in vivo, targeting any
tissues that possess ers, such as bone, uterus,
breast, blood vessels and liver. competitive binding
assay experiments have demonstrated high affinity
of the compound for both  xxxg730xxx  and  xxxg731xxx . like other
serms, lasofoxifene specifically binds to human
 xxxg730xxx , although with high affinity and a half-inhibition concentration (ic50) which is similar to that
seen with estradiol and thus at least 10-fold higher
than those reported for raloxifene, tamoxifen and
 xxxd1941xxx .[74-76] lasofoxifene also has a high affinity, similar to that of estradiol, for the human
 xxxg731xxx .[77] a recent report showed that the ability of
drugs aging 2007; 24 (5)

368

lasofoxifene to selectively bind to a particular er
subtype ( xxxg730xxx  or  xxxg731xxx ) can be species-dependent
and differs among humans, rats and mice, probably
because of species-specific differences in yet unidentified amino acids outside the binding pocket of
the receptors but contributing to binding affinity.[80]
moreover, lasofoxifene has a remarkably greater
oral bioavailability compared with other serm
compounds because of increased resistance to intestinal wall glucuronidation. this characteristic is due
to its nonpolar tetrahydronaphthalene structure,
making the compound a poorer substrate for
glucuronidation.[74-77,81] conversely, the phenolic
groups of benzothiophene derivatives such as raloxifene are extensively glucuronidated in the intestinal
wall, which would account for their poor oral
bioavailability and limited in vivo potency.[74-76] in
both preclinical and short-term clinical studies,
lasofoxifene has shown a favourable safety profile
and demonstrated a proven efficacy in preventing
bone loss and lowering cholesterol levels.
in bone cells, lasofoxifene exhibits an estrogenlike activity and, similar to estradiol, induces
apoptosis of osteoclast precursors, thus decreasing
bone resorption.[82] different short-term and longterm in vivo studies in ovx rats have demonstrated
that lasofoxifene treatment (at doses of 10–1000 mug/
kg/day) reduces bone turnover and effectively protects against ovx-induced bone loss without any
major adverse effect.[77,82-84] bone histomorphometry studies of the lumbar vertebrae have confirmed
that the bone-protective effects of lasofoxifene are
identical to those observed with estradiol, indicating
that this compound is a full estrogen agonist on
bone.[82,84] moreover, peripheral quantitative ct
analysis of the proximal tibial metaphysis and biomechanical testing of the fourth lumbar vertebra
clearly indicated that lasofoxifene treatment maintains bone quality and preserves bone strength in
treated animals.[84] interestingly, lasofoxifene has
also been shown to be effective in the prevention of
bone loss induced by aging or orchidectomy (orx)
in male models of osteoporosis, without significant
effects on the prostate,[85,86] suggesting a potential
application of this compound for the treatment of

gennari et al.

osteoporosis not only in postmenopausal women but
also in elderly men. a higher dose (10–100 vs
0.01–0.1 mug/kg/day) was required to prevent orxinduced decrease in bone mass compared with agerelated decrease. preclinical studies demonstrated
additional extraskeletal benefits of lasofoxifene on
serum lipids[77,82-87] as well as chemopreventive and
therapeutic effects on breast cancer, comparable
with those of tamoxifen.[88,89] no uterine hypertrophic effects were observed at doses of 1–1000 mug/
kg/day in ovx rats[77,84] or at doses of 0.1–100 mug/
kg/day in immature (3-week-old) or aged
(17-month-old) intact female rats.[82]
human phase i studies have indicated that
lasofoxifene is well tolerated even at doses that are
higher than those actually involved in clinical trials.[74-76] in general, adverse events were mild or
moderate and usually resolved within a few days.
moreover, there were no changes in adverse event
frequency or intensity with increasing dose. in a
2-year, phase ii, comparative study of 410 women,
the adverse event profile of lasofoxifene was similar
to that of raloxifene with respect to increases in hot
flashes and leg cramps compared with placebo; an
increased frequency of urogenital symptoms (mainly increased vaginal moisture, considered to be beneficial by some women) was observed in lasofoxifene-treated groups compared with the raloxifenetreated group.[90] this effect has been further confirmed in subsequent studies[91,92] and indicates potential additional benefits that lasofoxifene may
have compared with raloxifene in the treatment of
urogenital atrophy.
at the time of writing this article, only one peerreviewed published report relating to a phase ii,
clinical trial of lasofoxifene was available.[93] the
remaining reviewed data have been taken from brief
reports, abstract presentations and the us fda
clinicaltrials website.[71] currently available results
from phase ii studies of lasofoxifene in postmenopausal women are consistent with findings in
preclinical models and demonstrated a significant
effect of the compound in the suppression of bone
turnover and prevention of bone loss after menopause.[93-97] the overall results from the dose redrugs aging 2007; 24 (5)

serms for postmenopausal osteoporosis

sponse analyses suggested that the lowest lasofoxifene dose necessary to achieve a fully efficacious
response on total hip bmd, lumbar spine bmd
and ldl-c levels is 0.25 mg/day.[94] lasofoxifene
has also been compared with hrt or raloxifene.[90,93,96,98,99] in a first phase ii study, lasofoxifene increased bmd as effectively as conjugate
estrogen (prempro™, premarin® conjugated estrogen with  xxxd2554xxx  [wyeth
pharmaceuticals, philadelphia, pa, usa])1 [98,99] a
subsequent, 2-year, phase ii, comparative study suggested a similar or even greater effect of lasofoxifene (0.25 and 1.0 mg/day) over raloxifene (60 mg/
day) on bmd and bone turnover markers.[93,96]
the phase iii clinical trial programme for
lasofoxifene in osteoporosis was initiated in september 2000.[99] the programme includes two completed identical, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
2-year studies (opal [osteoporosis prevention
and lipid lowering]),[92,97] an ongoing fracture trial
(pearl [postmenopausal evaluation and risk-reduction with lasofoxifene]) and a comparative trial
with raloxifene (coral [comparison of raloxifene and lasofoxifene) [table ii].[98] pooled preliminary results from the opal studies have been
recently presented in abstract form.[92,97] these were
two identical phase iii, 24-month, prospective,
randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebocontrolled, multicentre trials of 1907 healthy
postmenopausal women aged 40–75 years (3–20
years postmenopausal). in these studies, lasofoxifene treatment significantly increased bmd and
decreased bone turnover compared with placebo,
with beneficial changes observed as early as 6
months.[97] all three lasofoxifene dosages significantly increased lumbar and femoral bmd at 6, 12
and 24 months as compared with decreases observed
in the calcium- and vitamin d-supplemented placebo group. at 2 years, lumbar bmd increased by
1.5%, 2.3% and 2.3% in the lasofoxifene 0.025, 0.25
and 0.5 mg/day treatment groups, respectively, as
compared with a decrease of 0.7% with placebo. a
significant decrease in bone turnover markers was
also observed at 6 and 24 months in lasofoxifene

treatment groups compared with placebo. moreover,
bone biopsies in lasofoxifene-treated subjects
showed bone of normal quality. however, these
preliminary positive results from the opal studies
need to be confirmed in long-term phase iii trials to
evaluate the real impact of lasofoxifene in the treatment of osteoporosis and prevention of osteoporotic
fractures. in particular, fracture prevention represents a primary endpoint that must be addressed for
any compound that is under investigation for treating osteoporosis.[100] in this respect, results from the
ongoing pearl trial are expected to clarify this
issue. moreover, data from the coral comparative study of the effect of lasofoxifene versus raloxifene in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis are also awaited to obtain a true understanding of the therapeutic potential of this compound.
importantly, most of the abovementioned studies
were also designed to evaluate the effects of
lasofoxifene on extraskeletal targets such as breast,
vagina, brain and the cardiovascular system. thus
far, detailed as well as long-term data on adverse
events are lacking. in particular, it remains to be
established if lasofoxifene has a neutral or promoting activity on hot flashes and other vasomotor
symptoms. moreover, a recent preclinical study also
demonstrated that lasofoxifene (as with estrogen)
stimulates uterine matrix metalloproteinase
(mmp)-2 activity to a level twice that of raloxifene.[101] in the same model, levormeloxifene (a
different serm compound) elevated  xxxg1428xxx  activity to a level 12-fold that of raloxifene. this increase
in mmp activity could have a negative effect on
the structural integrity of the uterine collagenous
matrix[102] and could explain the increased incidence
of pelvic organ prolapse associated with hrt
and levormeloxifene treatment (which was the primary reason levormeloxifene development was
halted).[52,53] thus, further long-term study data are
needed to evaluate the potential effects of lasofoxifene on the risk of pelvic organ prolapse. similarly,

the compound on serum lipids and fibrinogen levels.
in summary, notwithstanding encouraging
preclinical evidence and the improved pharmacokinetic profile of lasofoxifene compared with other
serms, results from ongoing long-term phase iii
trials are required to (i) establish if lasofoxifene may
be a valid alternative to hrt and raloxifene in the
treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, and (ii) evaluate further indications for this
compound in the management of women’s health

 xxxd289xxx  (bza,  xxxd289xxx ) is a tissue-specific serm being developed for use alone for the
prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in combination with  xxxd2044xxx  for menopausal symptoms.[103]
the compound is currently in the early phases of
review by the fda and, if approved, will be available in approximately 2008.  xxxd289xxx  is an indole-based er ligand with unique structural characteristics relative to raloxifene and tamoxifen, and
has been stringently selected to ensure an improved
profile compared with its predecessors.[103-106] the
compound binds to both  xxxg730xxx  and  xxxg731xxx , with a
slightly higher affinity for  xxxg730xxx . however, it is less
 xxxg730xxx -selective than raloxifene, with an affinity for
 xxxg730xxx  that is about 10-fold lower than that of 17betaestradiol.[104,105] in preclinical in vivo and in vitro
models,  xxxd289xxx  was shown to interact with
ers and positively affect the skeletal and lipid profile without stimulating the uterine endometrium,
causing breast cancer cell proliferation or negatively
impacting on the cns.
the preclinical data supporting  xxxd289xxx  as
an antiresorptive therapy for the prevention and
treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis are well
documented. in different studies in the ovx rat
model,  xxxd289xxx  was effective in maintaining
bone mass at a dose as low as 0.1 mg/kg/day,
reaching maximal significant efficacy at a dose of
0.3 mg/kg/day.[104,105] moreover, this dosage maintained vertebral compressive strength equivalent or
drugs aging 2007; 24 (5)

serms for postmenopausal osteoporosis

better than that observed in sham-operated animals.
the histological quality of bone (proximal tibia) was
maintained and correlated well with the increases in
bmd and compressive force data. the efficacy of
 xxxd289xxx  as measured by skeletal parameters
appears to be similar to that reported for the serms
raloxifene and lasofoxifene.[82,107] interestingly, in a
more recent study in ovx monkeys,  xxxd289xxx 
treatment at dosage levels up to 25 mg/kg/day for 18
months resulted in partial preservation of bone mass
(as determined by bone densitometry), no negative
effect on bone strength and significant reductions in
ovx-induced increases in bone turnover (evaluated
by biochemical markers and histomorphometric indices in cancellous and cortical bone).[108] in all
preclinical in vivo studies,  xxxd289xxx  was well
tolerated and was not associated with any adverse
effects on plasma lipids or reproductive tract histology. importantly, an improved uterine profile for
 xxxd289xxx  compared with raloxifene was demonstrated.[104] furthermore, at bone-sparing dosages,
 xxxd289xxx  but not raloxifene did not antagonise
the effect of 17beta-estradiol on vasomotor symptoms.[103-105] an increase in endothelial  xxxd2738xxx 
synthase activity (implying a possible greater control of atherogenic processes) has also been reported
for  xxxd289xxx  relative to raloxifene.[103]
importantly, preclinical combination studies
have been conducted to evaluate the effect of
 xxxd289xxx  when administered alongside  xxxd2044xxx  (premarin®) or human parathyroid
hormone ( xxxd2847xxx ).[109] at doses 7- to 10-fold higher
than the bone efficacious dose,  xxxd289xxx 
antagonised the uterine stimulation by premarin®,
without differences in uterine weight compared with
untreated ovx controls. in contrast, positive skeletal effects were maintained, since ovx mice codosed with  xxxd289xxx  3 mg/kg/day and
premarin® 2.5 mg/kg/day had bmd and cancellous
bone compartments similar to those of sham-operated animals. a similar study compared the effects of
addition of different serms (raloxifene,  xxxd289xxx  and lasofoxifene) to bone efficacious dosages
of  xxxd2044xxx .[110] although no differences in skeletal parameters were noted for the three

groups, only  xxxd289xxx  was able to antagonise
the effect of conjugated estrogen on uterine wet
weight. another study in ovx mice[87] evaluated
the ability of lasofoxifene 0.1 mg/kg/day,  xxxd289xxx  0.3 mg/kg/day and raloxifene 3 mg/kg/day or
 xxxd3128xxx  1 mg/kg/day to enhance reversal of
established osteopenia when co-administered with
 xxxd2847xxx  10 mug/kg/day subcutaneously. after 4 weeks
of treatment, total and trabecular bmd were 3–10%
higher in all of the co-treatment groups compared
with the  xxxd2847xxx -monotherapy group. overall, these
preclinical data indicated that  xxxd289xxx  may
represent a promising new treatment for osteoporosis (either alone or in combination with conjugate estrogen), with a potential for fewer uterine and
vasomotor effects than serms currently used in
clinical practice.
despite the fact that the preclinical evidence relating to  xxxd289xxx  has been encouraging, only
very limited clinical data for this compound are
available. several phase i trials have been conducted
in healthy postmenopausal women with the objective of studying the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of  xxxd289xxx ; these trials have also reported
no significant adverse effects.[103,111-114] in a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase ii trial, 494 healthy postmenopausal
women were treated with  xxxd289xxx  (5, 10 or 20
mg/day) for 3 months in addition to calcium supplementation (600 mg/day).[115]  xxxd289xxx  produced a dose-dependent reduction in bone turnover
markers compared with placebo at dosages as low as
5 mg/day. when administered at doses of 20 or 40
mg/day,  xxxd289xxx  reduced bone turnover by
20% and 26%, respectively, without incidence of
endometrial hyperplasia.[115,116] interestingly, in another phase ii study,  xxxd289xxx  (10 and 20 mg/
day) combined with conjugate estrogen therapy significantly diminished not only the stimulatory endometrial effect of estrogen but also the vasomotor
symptoms of the menopause, compared with placebo.[103] a randomised, double-blind, phase ii study
of  xxxd289xxx  versus placebo is ongoing in 375
japanese patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis
to evaluate the effect of therapy on bmd.

design
characteristics

arzoxifene (ly353381) is a novel investigational serm that has been designed to have greater
bioavailability and more sustained antiestrogenic
activity than raloxifene.[118] arzoxifene is a
benzothiophene analogue in which the carbonyl
hinge of raloxifene has been replaced by an ether
(figure 1). this modification results in increased
estrogen antagonist properties, as demonstrated in
mcf-7 cell proliferation assays, and increased binding affinity for the  xxxg730xxx  compared with raloxifene,
rendering this drug one of the most potent serms
under investigation.[118-125] the substitution of the
carbonyl site of raloxifene with an oxygen further
results in increased oral bioavailability by reducing
first-pass glucuronidation.[122] arzoxifene is metabolically desmethylated in vivo to yield desmethyl
arzoxifene, an active metabolite that is an even more
potent ligand for both  xxxg730xxx  and  xxxg731xxx  than both
arzoxifene and raloxifene.[126,127]
preclinical data have shown arzoxifene to have
antiestrogenic effects on breast and uterine tissue
while having estrogenic effects on bone and lipid
metabolism. interestingly, arzoxifene has been

phase iii trials of  xxxd289xxx  (alone and in
combination with premarin®) for postmenopausal
osteoporosis have been in progress since october
2001 (table iii) and some of these are still ongoing
in may 2006, with over 10 000 women worldwide
having been included.[103,109,110] these trials include
a randomised, comparative, double-blind, placebocontrolled study of  xxxd289xxx  versus raloxifene
(nct00205777) for the evaluation of vertebral fracture incidence and safety in osteoporotic postmenopausal women, and a randomised, double-blind,
parallel-assignment, active-control study of
 xxxd289xxx  plus a  xxxd2044xxx  combination (nct00242710) for the prevention of endometrial hyperplasia and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.[117] other phase iii trials of
 xxxd289xxx  and  xxxd2044xxx  combinations are ongoing for the treatment of vasomotor
symptoms associated with menopause. no data are
currently available from these trials.

demonstrated to inhibit several breast and endometrial cancer models in both in vitro and in vivo
studies.[118,122,127-131] furthermore, in comparative
preclinical studies, arzoxifene was shown to be a
more potent inhibitor of tumour growth than both
tamoxifen and raloxifene, when given at an
equivalent dose.[32,118,119,127] in immature rats, arzoxifene completely inhibited uterine growth, which
was stimulated by estrogen.[122] in ovx rats, longterm treatment with arzoxifene did not have growth
proliferative effects on the endometrium and
showed a protective effect on bone.[132] at dosages
of 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, arzoxifene was equally
effective in protecting against ovx-induced loss in
cancellous bone mass, architecture and strength.
hystomorphometry studies of the proximal tibial
metaphysis showed that arzoxifene prevented bone
loss by reducing osteoclast numbers while maintaining bone formation indices at sham levels. at both
these bone protective doses, arzoxifene also had a
marked beneficial effect on serum lipid levels. in
another study in ovx mice, the combination of
arzoxifene and pth increased bone mass at trabecular bone sites at a faster rate and to a greater extent
than pth alone or the combinations of equine estrogens plus pth and raloxifene plus pth.[133]
a great part of the available clinical data for
arzoxifene pertains to breast cancer trials. indeed,
because of its promising preclinical results, the drug
first entered clinical development for treatment of
breast cancer. in a phase i study in women with
metastatic breast cancer, arzoxifene at different dosages (10, 20, 50 or 100 mg/day) was well tolerated
with no dose-limiting toxicities even in patients with
liver involvement.[134] the most common adverse
effects were hot flashes, observed in 56% of patients
regardless of dose. furthermore, a decrease in osteocalcin was observed, suggesting a possible benefit
for bone health. preliminary data from healthy volunteers suggested that arzoxifene at a dosage of 10
mg/day is biologically active and that treatment with
25 mg/day up to 100 mg/day seems to have similar
effects on bone markers, lipoprotein levels and
gonadotropin levels.[119] in patients with advanced

dometrial cancer, arzoxifene 20 mg/day achieved a
positive response in 34% of women with minimal
toxicity.[135] nevertheless, and despite positive results from phase ii studies of women with hormonesensitive breast cancer,[134,136] a subsequent phase iii
trial was stopped after the findings from the first
interim analysis suggested that arzoxifene appeared
inferior to tamoxifen with regard to time to progression of tumours. based on this result, no further
trials of arzoxifene for breast cancer have been
planned, and the compound is currently being evaluated for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.[119]
two phase iii trials ongoing since 2004 are evaluating the potential benefits of arzoxifene in bone
health (table iv). trial 8356 (nct00088010) is a
6-year, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that started in june 2004 and is evaluating the effects of arzoxifene on fractures and bone
mass in postmenopausal women (expected number
9100) with osteoporosis or low bmd.[137] trial 8537
(nct00085956) is a 3-year, randomised, doubleblind, placebo-controlled study that commenced in
april 2004 and is assessing the effect of arzoxifene
on bmd at the spine and hip in 300 postmenopausal
women without vertebral fractures.[138] effects on
breast cancer prevention, uterine status, cardiovascular events and serum lipids will be also evaluated
as additional outcomes in these trials. no data are
currently available, but both studies are currently on
hold for interim analyses.
3. conclusions and
future developments
estrogen deficiency plays a major role in the
development of osteoporosis and hrt has been the
most frequently prescribed drug for the prevention
of bone loss and fractures in postmenopausal women, as well as for the management of menopausal
symptoms for many years. however, results from
the whi and other recent randomised, controlled
trials[22,23] have forced a reconsideration of the use of
hrt, in light of the reported increased risk for
cardiovascular disease, stroke, pulmonary embolism
and breast cancer. although the currently available

fortunately, new compounds are in development
with the overall goal of making new serms with
greater efficacy and potency, but without the adverse effects associated with current therapies. of
these new compounds,  xxxd2798xxx , lasofoxifene,
 xxxd289xxx  and arzoxifene have been shown to be
effective in animal models of osteoporosis and are
now in clinical phase iii studies. preliminary available data indicate that these agents have additional
benefits compared with previous serms compounds in term of potency (i.e. lasofoxifene and
arzoxifene), prevention of urogenital atrophy ( xxxd2798xxx  and lasofoxifene), antagonistic activity in
the uterus ( xxxd289xxx  and arzoxifene) and reduction of vasomotor symptoms ( xxxd289xxx ). however, notwithstanding the encouraging preclinical
and clinical evidence, only very limited data from
phase iii trials are available and the efficacy of these
compounds in the prevention of osteoporotic fractures remains unknown. at the moment, insufficient
clinical data and a lack of detailed information on
possible adverse effects (i.e. thromboembolic disorders) preclude informed predictions on the future of
these compounds.

a major concern, especially given the type of longterm therapy that is required to prevent osteoporosis.
moreover, both preclinical and clinical reports suggest that these serms are considerably less potent
than estrogen.

development of a serm with an ‘ideal pharmacological profile’, that is, estrogen-like activity on
bone and vasomotor symptoms, anti-estrogenic activity on the breast and neutral activity on the uterus,
is far from having been achieved. it is also likely
that the ideal serm profile for one patient may be
quite different from the ideal profile for another.
thus, future serm research will focus on the development of a group of different compounds, each
with a somewhat different profile, that may be radrugs aging 2007; 24 (5)

tionally administered to different patients with a
spectrum of needs. an alternative promising strategy is represented by research into combination therapies comprising new serms (i.e.  xxxd289xxx )
and conjugate estrogens to provide a more balanced
‘estrogenic’ response. furthermore, since estrogenic
effects are primarily mediated through both  xxxg730xxx 
and  xxxg731xxx , significant attention is now being directed
to identifying subtype-selective er modulators, agonists and antagonists.
