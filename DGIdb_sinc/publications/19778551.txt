current smokers express the desire to quit. however, the majority ﬁnd it difﬁcult to remain abstinent. as
such, research efforts continually seek to develop more effective treatment. one such area of research
involves the interoceptive stimulus effects of nicotine as either a discriminative stimulus in an operant drug
discrimination task, or more recently as a conditional stimulus (cs) in a discriminated goal-tracking task. the
present work investigated the potential role nicotinic acetylcholine receptors play in the cs effects of
nicotine (0.4 mg/kg) using antagonists with differential selectivity for  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx *, alpha7*, alpha6beta2*, and alpha3beta4* receptors.
methyllycaconitine (mla) had no effect on nicotine-evoked conditioned responding.  xxxd2550xxx  and
dihydro-beta-erythroidine (dhbetae) dose-dependently blocked responding evoked by the nicotine cs. in a timecourse assessment of  xxxd2550xxx  and dhbetae, each blocked conditioned responding when given 5 min
before testing and still blocked conditioned responding when administered 200 min before testing. two
novel bis-picolinium analogs (n, n′-(3, 3′-(dodecan-1,12-diyl)-bis-picolinium dibromide [bpiddb], and n,
n′-(decan-1,10-diyl)-bis-picolinium diiodide [bpidi]) did not block nicotine-evoked conditioned responding.
finally, pretreatment with low dose combinations of  xxxd2550xxx , dextromethorphan, and/or bupropion
was used to target alpha3beta4* receptors. no combination blocked conditioned responding evoked by the training
dose of nicotine. however, a combination of  xxxd2550xxx  and dextromethorphan partially blocked
nicotine-evoked conditioned responding to a lower dose of nicotine (0.1 mg/kg). these results indicate that
 xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx * and potentially alpha3beta4* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors play a role in the cs effects of nicotine and are
potential targets for the development of nicotine cessation aids.

1. introduction
nicotine addiction is the number one preventable cause of death
(mackay and eriksen, 2002). the majority of current smokers express a
desire to quit (approximately 70%). however, few are able to remain
abstinent longer than one month when treated with current smoking
cessation therapies, with most relapsing within one week (national
institute on drug abuse (nida), 2006). a multifaceted approach to
nicotine addiction is essential for successful treatment with a need to take
into consideration genetic, neural, behavioral, and social factors
(cf. volkow and li, 2005). as such, there is an increased interest in and
need for basic research to further elucidate the underlying processes
involved in nicotine addiction. of primary interest in the present report
are the interoceptive (subjective) effects of nicotine.
the interoceptive stimulus effects of nicotine are complex and a
variety of preclinical tasks using rats have been developed to study the

nicotine stimulus [for reviews see smith and stolerman (2009) and
wooters et al. (in press)]. the two-lever operant drug discrimination
procedure has been the most widely used of these methods. in that
task, nicotine serves as a discriminative stimulus (sd) indicating
which lever press will be reinforced. alternatively, some recent
studies have used a discriminated goal-tracking task in which nicotine
serves as a conditional stimulus (cs) for intermittent access to the
reinforcer (bevins, 2009). there is precedent in the literature
suggesting that the neuropharmacological processes mediating the
subjective effects of a nicotine cs differ, in part, from those mediating
the operant sd effects. for example, using a two-lever drug
discrimination task zakharova et al. (2005) demonstrated that
nmda channel blockers play a minimal role in the sd effects of
nicotine (see also kim and brioni, 1995; zaniewska et al., 2008). in
contrast, murray and bevins (2007a) found that mk-801, a noncompetitive nmda channel blocker, antagonized the cs effects of nicotine.
more recently, our lab has demonstrated another dissociation between
the cs and sd effects of nicotine. the cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx 
antagonist/ xxxd1422xxx  rimonabant blocked the cs effects of
nicotine (murray et al., 2009), but has not been found to block the
sd effects of nicotine [e.g., zaniewska et al. (2006); see wooters et al.

(in press) for a discussion of other potential differences]. because these
examples suggest that the neuropharmacological processes mediating
the cs effects of nicotine differ somewhat from those of the sd effects, it
is important not to assume that ﬁndings regarding the sd effects of
nicotine will necessarily hold for the cs effects.
with this in mind, we sought to examine whether antagonists
selective for different  xxxg456xxx  (nachr) subtypes
would block the cs effects of nicotine. although there has been some
research in this area with the nicotine sd (e.g., smith et al., 2007;
zaniewska et al., 2006), there is limited research on the role of nachr
subtypes in the cs effects of nicotine. to date, it has only been shown that
the central and peripheral nachr antagonist  xxxd2550xxx  (see later)
blocked the cs effects of nicotine, yet the mostly peripheral antagonist
hexamethonium had no effect; a pattern that suggests a role for centrally
located nachrs in the cs effects of nicotine (besheer et al., 2004). in the
ﬁrst experiment of this report, we determined whether antagonists with
differential selectivity for the  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx *, alpha7*, and alpha6beta2* nachr subtypes
blocked the cs effects of nicotine. compounds that were effective at
blocking conditioned responding evoked by the nicotine cs (i.e.,
 xxxd2550xxx  and dhbetae) were then evaluated for their duration of
action. such an evaluation was conducted to provide much needed
parametric information regarding these widely used antagonists.
the second experiment in this report targeted alpha3beta4* nachrs.
receptors containing these subunits are of interest because they are
concentrated in the habenulointerpeduncular pathway. this pathway
interacts with the mesolimbic system that has been widely implicated
with the abuse potential of drugs (taraschenko et al., 2007). there are no
compounds currently available that preferentially target alpha3beta4* receptors.
thus, we adopted the strategy of glick et al. (2002) and used low dose
combinations of drugs ( xxxd2550xxx , dextromethorphan, and bupropion) that overlap in antagonist action at the alpha3beta4* subunit. with this
strategy, glick et al. (2002) found that such low dose combinations of
drugs decreased intravenous nicotine self-administration. we determined
whether a similar approach would block the cs effects of nicotine.
previous research from our laboratory had established dose–effect
functions for  xxxd2550xxx  or bupropion antagonism of the cs effects
of nicotine (besheer et al., 2004; wilkinson et al., 2009). thus, for the
present study only a dose response curve for dextromethorphan alone
was needed to identify low doses before the drug combination tests. to
conﬁrm this earlier research, however, we did test the dose of each drug
utilized in this experiment for antagonism and substitution before any
combination testing.

the ceiling, front, and back walls were clear polycarbonate. each chamber
contained a recessed dipper receptacle (5.2×5.2×3.8 cm; l×w×d) in one
aluminum sidewall. when the dipper arm was raised, it allowed access to
0.1 ml of 26% sucrose solution (w/v). an infrared emitter/detector unit
located 1.2 cm inside the receptacle and 3 cm from the ﬂoor recorded
head entries. a second infrared emitter/detector unit was mounted
14.5 cm from the sidewall containing the receptacle and 4 cm above the
rod ﬂoor. interruptions of this infrared unit provided a measure of general
chamber activity. a personal computer with med-associates interface and
software (med-pc for windows, version iv) timed the sessions, presented
the sucrose, and recorded beam breaks for dipper entries and chamber
crosses.
2.3. drugs
(−)- xxxd2721xxx  (+)-bitartrate salt (nicotine),
 xxxd2550xxx  ( xxxd2550xxx ), and (9s,13s,14s)- xxxd1861xxx  hydrobromide (dextromethorphan) were purchased from sigma (st. louis, mo
usa). (2s,13bs)-2-methoxy-2,3,5,6,8,9,10,13-octahydro-1h,12h-benzo
[i]pyrano[3,4-g]indolizin-12-one hydrobromide (dihydro-beta-erythroidine
[dhbetae]) and [1a,4(s),6b,14a,16b]-20-ethyl-1,6,14,16-tetramethoxy-4[[[2-(3-methyl-2,5-dioxo-1-pyrrolidinyl)benzoyl]oxy]methyl]aconitane7,8-d iol citrate (methyllycaconitine [mla]) were purchased from tocris
(ellisville, mo usa). 1-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-[(1,1-dimethylethyl)amino]1-propanone hydrochloride (bupropion) was purchased from toronto
research chemicals (toronto, on, canada). two bis-picolinium analogs n,
n′-(3, 3′-(dodecan-1,12-diyl)-bis-picolinium dibromide (bpiddb), and n,
n′-(decan-1,10-diyl)-bis-picolinium diiodide (bpidi) were synthesized
according to previously established methods (ayers et al., 2002), and
obtained from the department of pharmaceutical sciences, college of
pharmacy, at the university of kentucky (lexington, ky usa). all drugs
were dissolved in 0.9% saline solution and injected subcutaneously (sc) at
a volume of 1 ml/kg, except that bupropion was injected intraperitoneally
(ip). drug doses and injection-to-placement intervals were selected based
on past research (besheer et al., 2004; shoaib et al., 2000; glick et al., 2002;
motoshima et al., 2005; neugebauer et al., 2006; murray and bevins,
2007a,b; dwoskin et al., 2008). for each testing phase, a unique testing
order was used for each rat. the ph of nicotine and dextromethorphan
was adjusted to 7.0±0.2 with a dilute naoh solution. nicotine doses are
reported in the base form; all other drug doses are reported in the salt
form.

2. materials and methods
2.4. acquisition
2.1. subjects
thirty-two (n=16/experiment) male sprague–dawley rats (weighing 269±3 g at the start of the study) were obtained from harlan
(indianapolis, in usa). rats were individually housed in clear polycarbonate cages lined with wood shavings in a temperature- and humiditycontrolled room. water was continuously available in the home cage.
food access was restricted to maintain rats at 85% of their free-feeding
weight. approximately every 30 days the target weight was increased by
2 g. all sessions were conducted during the light portion of a 12 h light:
dark cycle. experimental protocols were approved by the university of
nebraska-lincoln institutional animal care and use committee and
followed the “guide for the care and use of laboratory animals” (national
research council, 1996).
2.2. apparatus
eight conditioning chambers (med-associates, georgia, vt, usa) were
used in this study. each chamber measuring 30.5×24.1×21 cm (l×w×h)
was enclosed in a light and sound attenuating cubicle ﬁtted with a fan to
provide airﬂow and mask noise. the sidewalls were made of aluminum;

before the start of the experiment, all rats were handled for at least
2 min each for 3 days. for the 3 days immediately preceding acquisition,
rats were treated daily with the training dose of nicotine (0.4 mg/kg) in
the home cage to attenuate the initial locomotor suppressant effects of
nicotine (besheer et al., 2004; bevins et al., 2001). daily training sessions
began the day following the last nicotine injection in the home cage.
training involved intermixed nicotine (0.4 mg/kg) and 0.9% saline
sessions; injections occurred 5 min before placement in the conditioning
chamber for a 20-min session. during nicotine sessions, rats had 4-s
intermittent access to sucrose on 36 separate occasions. on saline sessions,
sucrose deliveries were withheld. four different computer programs were
devised to vary sucrose timing of sucrose deliveries on nicotine sessions.
programs for saline sessions had 4-s ‘empty’ intervals inserted to equate
comparisons with nicotine sessions. the average time before the ﬁrst
sucrose delivery (or equivalent time in saline sessions) across programs
was 137 s with a range of 124 to 152 s. time between subsequent
deliveries within a program ranged from 4 to 80 s with a mean of 25 s.
nicotine and saline programs were randomly assigned to each rat with the
condition that no more than two of the same session type occurred in a
row.

2.5. testing
following training of the discrimination, rats entered a testing
phase composed of repeating 5 day cycles. the ﬁrst 4 days of each
cycle were continued training sessions (2 nicotine and 2 saline) as
described earlier. if the discrimination was maintained as deﬁned by
the testing criterion (see later), a 4-min extinction test session
occurred in place of a normal training session on day 5; sucrose was
withheld during test sessions. if the criterion was not met, the rat
remained in the home cage on day 5.
2.5.1. nicotine generalization
nicotine generalization testing immediately followed acquisition
of the discrimination. on test days, the assigned dose of nicotine (see
table 1) or saline was injected 5 min before a 4-min extinction test.
2.5.2. antagonism and substitution
following completion of nicotine generalization, testing cycles
continued as previously described. for antagonism testing, the
assigned antagonist(s) was injected at the prescribed time. as in
training, nicotine was administered 5 min before testing. substitution
tests were similar except that saline replaced nicotine as the solution
5 min before testing. in these experiments, substitution tests were
used to evaluate if there were any drug-alone effects. if there were no
drug-alone effects, then conditioned responding would be different
from nicotine, but not different from saline. table 1 shows the
progression of testing and key procedural details for experiments 1
and 2.
2.6. dependent measures and testing criterion
the main dependent measure was the rate per second of entries
into the dipper receptacle before the ﬁrst sucrose delivery on nicotine
sessions or equivalent time for saline and test sessions. a rate measure

321

was used because the time before the ﬁrst sucrose delivery varied
between sessions. dipper entries before the ﬁrst sucrose delivery
were used so as to not confound any measure of conditioned
responding with receiving sucrose in that session (cf. besheer et al.,
2004). in order to qualify to test, dipper entry rate on each nicotine
session had to be at least 0.01 dipper entries per second higher than
each saline session of that testing cycle (cf. murray and bevins,
2007a). to determine whether drug treatment affected motor activity,
the number of chamber beam breaks per second was also analyzed.
we used a rate measure from the exact time period as dipper entries
to facilitate comparison across measures. the median effective dose
(ed50) for nicotine generalization was calculated using the linear
portion of the ascending limb of the dose–effect curve.
2.7. data analyses
for acquisition training, a paired-samples t-test was used to
compare the mean of the last three days of training. for all testing
phases evaluating dose or duration of antagonism, dipper entries and
chamber activity were analyzed with separate one-way repeated
measures anovas. signiﬁcant one-way anovas were followed with
pair-wise comparisons using fisher's lsdminimum mean difference (mmd)
tests. when using an lsd follow-up comparison, if the difference
between the two data points being compared is larger than the
calculated lsdmmd for the associated anova then the two data points
are signiﬁcantly different from each other. on test days there were
two injections—test compound and either nicotine or saline. as such,
each testing phase had pretreatment injections of saline that were
administered at each of the respective injection-to-placement intervals used before administration of the nicotine training dose (5-min
before chamber placement). relative to nicotine alone, pretreatment
with saline did not affect responding evoked by nicotine. thus, the
mean of the two scores for each rat was used for analyses. data for test
phases that evaluated speciﬁc drug doses or drug combinations were

3.2. testing
3.2.1. nicotine generalization
fig. 1a shows the mean dipper entry rate for the nicotine
generalization phase for experiment 1 (ﬁlled squares) and 2 (empty
circles). nicotine-evoked conditioned responding was sensitive to test
dose [dose main effect experiment 1, f(5,75) = 16.24, p < 0.001;
experiment 2, f(5,75)=15.38, p<0.001]. in both experiments, dipper
entry rate was higher at 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/kg nicotine than saline
(experiment 1, lsdmmd =0.059; experiment 2, lsdmmd =0.05). furthermore, the rate of entries at 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg was lower than the
training dose of nicotine (0.4 mg/kg). as shown in fig. 1b, chamber
activity increased with nicotine dose [dose main effect experiment 1,
f(5,75)=4.91, p<0.001; experiment 2, f(5,75)=11.81, p<0.001]. for
experiment 1, activity was higher at 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg nicotine than saline
(lsdmmd =0.083); only 0.4 mg/kg nicotine was higher than saline in
experiment 2 (lsdmmd =0.08). activity at the nicotine training dose was
higher than all other nicotine doses. the ed50 for nicotine in experiment 1
and 2 was 0.083 mg/kg and 0.08 mg/kg, respectively.

fig. 1. panel a shows the mean (± sem) dipper entry rates during nicotine
generalization testing. panel b shows the mean (± sem) beam breaks per second
(activity) during nicotine generalization testing. for both experiments ⁎ denotes a
signiﬁcant difference (p < 0.05) from saline; + denotes a signiﬁcant difference from the
training dose of nicotine (0.4 mg/kg). # denotes signiﬁcant difference (p < 0.05) from

analyzed using paired-samples t-tests for both dipper entries and
chamber activity. for antagonist tests, contrasts were ﬁrst limited to
each drug or drug combination compared only with the training dose
of nicotine. any signiﬁcant differences prompted a paired-samples ttest comparing that drug dose with saline. for substitution tests, each
drug and dose was ﬁrst compared to saline using paired-samples ttests; a signiﬁcant difference prompted a paired-samples t-test
comparing that drug dose to nicotine. statistical signiﬁcance was
declared using p < 0.05 for all tests.
3. results
one rat from experiment 1 and two from experiment 2 were
removed from the experiments due to the inability to reliably
maintain the nicotine-saline discrimination (see table 1 for the
number of rats in each testing phase).
3.1. acquisition
in experiments 1 and 2, rats readily acquired the drug discrimination (data not shown). the mean dipper entry rate across the last 3
nicotine sessions in experiment 1 was signiﬁcantly elevated compared to saline sessions, t(15) = 7.27, p < 0.001. the mean dipper
entry rate across the last 3 nicotine sessions in experiment 2 was

3.2.2. mla, dhbetae, and  xxxd2550xxx  antagonism of nicotine
fig. 2a shows conditioned responding evoked by nicotine after
pretreatment of mla, dhbetae, or  xxxd2550xxx . mla did not block
nicotine-evoked conditioned responding (dose main effect, f < 1). in
contrast, dhbetae blocked nicotine-evoked conditioned responding
[dose main effect, f(4,60) = 17.80, p < 0.001]. more speciﬁcally,
conditioned responding was fully antagonized to saline levels at the
10 mg/kg dose (lsdmmd = 0.05). antagonism was only partial at 1 and
3 mg/kg dhbetae with conditioned responding lower than the training
dose of nicotine, but still higher than saline.  xxxd2550xxx  also
blocked nicotine-evoked conditioned responding [dose main effect,
f(4,60) = 16.58, p < 0.001]. conditioned responding was antagonized
to saline levels by 1 and 2 mg/kg (lsdmmd = 0.05).  xxxd2550xxx  at
0.5 mg/kg partially blocked nicotine-evoked conditioned responding.
fig. 2b shows nicotine-induced activity after pretreatment with
mla, dhbetae, or  xxxd2550xxx . for mla there was a signiﬁcant main
effect of dose, f(3,45) = 3.44, p = 0.025. at 5 mg/kg mla, activity was
signiﬁcantly lower than the nicotine training dose, but still higher
than saline (lsdmmd = 0.127). for dhbetae there was a main effect of
dose, f(4,60) = 10.23, p < 0.001.  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg dhbetae, nicotine-evoked
activity was decreased to saline levels (lsdmmd = 0.097). at 3 mg/kg
dhbetae, activity was lower than at the nicotine training dose, but higher
than saline. for  xxxd2550xxx , there was a signiﬁcant effect of dose,
f(4,60) = 16.07, p < 0.001. all doses of  xxxd2550xxx  lowered
activity evoked by nicotine; counts at 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg  xxxd2550xxx  were comparable to saline (lsdmmd = 0.092).

323

3.2.3. dhbetae, and  xxxd2550xxx  substitution
 xxxd2550xxx  and dhbetae alone did not alter general chamber activity
(data not shown). neither dose of dhbetae (3 and 10 mg/kg) substituted for
the cs effects of nicotine [dose main effect, f(2,14)=57.50, p<0.001;
(lsdmmd =0.058)]. for activity, there was a main effect of dhbetae dose,
f(2,14)=12.82, p<0.001. activity was below nicotine, but did not differ
from saline (lsdmmd =0.147). neither dose of  xxxd2550xxx  (1 and
2 mg/kg) substituted for the cs effects of nicotine [dose main effect,
f(2,14)=33.37, p<0.001; (lsdmmd =0.058)]. for activity, there was a
main effect of  xxxd2550xxx  dose, f(2,14)=8.07, p=0.005. activity did
not differ from saline (lsdmmd =0.191).
3.2.4. dhbetae and  xxxd2550xxx  antagonism of nicotine: duration of
effects
fig. 3a and b shows the duration of antagonism of the cs effects of

dose for bpiddb, f(3,18) = 4.68, p = 0.012, with activity lowered to
saline levels at 3 mg/kg (lsdmmd = 0.093). there was a main effect of
dose for bpidi, f(3,18) = 13.60, p < 0.001. at 3.38 mg/kg bpidi, activity
was signiﬁcantly lower than nicotine and saline (lsdmmd = 0.158).
thus, the highest dose of bpidi impaired motor abilities.

p = 0.014. activity at 5, 25, and 50 min was at saline levels
(lsdmmd = 0.162). at the 10, 100, and 200 min ipis, activity was
lower than nicotine, but higher than saline. for 10 mg/kg dhbetae, there
was a main effect of ipi, f(6,42) = 5.11, p = 0.001. from 5 to 50 min
activity was at saline levels (lsdmmd = 0.177). at 100 and 200 min
activity was lower than nicotine, but still higher than saline. for 1 mg/

p < 0.001. activity was comparable to saline from the 10 to the
200 min ipi; the 5-min interval was different from nicotine and saline
(lsdmmd = 0.158). at 2 mg/kg  xxxd2550xxx , there was a main
effect of ipi, f(6,36) = 5.01, p = 0.001. activity was at saline levels at
time points (lsdmmd = 0.146).

conditioned responding was partially antagonized  xxxd1891xxx  and 20 mg/kg
(lsdmmd = 0.057). fig. 5b shows nicotine-induced activity after
dextromethorphan pretreatment. there was a signiﬁcant decrease in
activity with increased dextromethorphan dose [dose main effect,
f(4,56) = 6.84, p < 0.001]. at the 10 and 20 mg/kg dextromethorphan

the bottom portion of table 4 shows the dipper entry and activity
results for the combination tests with the higher dose of dextromethorphan (1 mg/kg). the dextromethorphan + bupropion drug
combination did not decrease conditioned responding to 0.1 mg/kg
nicotine, t < 1. in contrast, the dextromethorphan +  xxxd2550xxx 
combination decreased conditioned responding to the 0.1 mg/kg
nicotine dose, t(12) = − 2.85, p = 0.015, but was signiﬁcantly higher
than saline, t(12) = 3.50, p = 0.004. these results indicate partial
antagonism with this combination. for activity, the drug combinations and saline alone did not differ from 0.1 mg/kg nicotine, ts < 1.
4. discussion
as detailed in the introduction, a majority of smokers desire to quit, but
only a very small portion of them reach sustained abstinence (national
institute on drug abuse (nida), 2006). this outcome indicates that
chronic tobacco use and accompanying nicotine dependence is a
tenacious and complex problem. sustained abstinence remains low
even with the current pharmacotherapies available (nicotine, bupropion,
and varenicline) prompting the need for more research into nicotine and
its effects that may contribute to chronic tobacco use (dwoskin et al.,
2009). the discovery that nicotine has cs effects suggests that it may
acquire additional appetitive properties that could affect the progression
to addiction, the tenacity of the addiction, as well as to greater difﬁculty in
quitting and increased relapse [see bevins (2009) for a more in depth
discussion]. as such, elucidating the neuropharmacological mechanisms
underlying the cs effects of nicotine could aid at identifying new targets
for more effective pharmacotherapies.
the main purpose of the present study was to further elucidate the
neuropharmacological mechanisms mediating the cs effects of nicotine
using antagonists that have differential selectivity for nachr subunits. the
noncompetitive nachr antagonist  xxxd2550xxx  has been shown to
block the reinforcing (glick et al., 2002), the discriminative stimulus
(zaniewska et al., 2006), and the locomotor effects of nicotine (bevins and
besheer, 2001). the present research found that 1 and 2 mg/kg
 xxxd2550xxx  fully blocked nicotine-evoked conditioned responding
replicating a previous work from our laboratory (besheer et al., 2004).
although  xxxd2550xxx  is considered to be a broad-spectrum antagonist
at nachrs, a work by papke et al. (2001) indicates that  xxxd2550xxx  has
greater selectivity for alpha3beta4* receptors. this latter ﬁnding suggests a need
to further investigate alpha3beta4* receptors in the behavioral effects of nicotine.
dhbetae is a widely used antagonist with selectivity for  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx * nachrs
(williams and robinson, 1984). in the present study, it fully antagonized
nicotine-evoked conditioned responding  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg. this receptor is the
most abundant neuronal nachr (benowitz, 1996). nicotine has a high
afﬁnity for alpha4beta2* receptors and they are thought to play a major role in
the psychostimulant effects of nicotine (wonnacott et al., 2005). in
rodents, alpha4beta2* receptors upregulate with chronic nicotine administration
(gentry and lukas, 2002); this upregulation is also seen in the brains of
postmortem human smokers (benwell et al., 1988; breese et al., 1997).
dhbetae has also been shown to block the sd effects of nicotine in a two-lever
operant drug discrimination task (shoaib et al., 2000). our results extend
the conclusions of this research to the cs effects of nicotine as indexed in a
discriminated goal-tracking task.
 xxxd2550xxx  and dhbetae pretreatment also decreased nicotineinduced hyperactivity in the present study. subsequent tests with the two
highest doses of each antagonist alone (i.e., no nicotine) did not affect
baseline activity. this ﬁnding suggests that blockade of nicotine-evoked
conditioned responding does not reﬂect non-speciﬁc motor impairment
of these compounds. thus, pretreatment with dhbetae and  xxxd2550xxx 
appears to block the cs effects of nicotine along with nicotine-induced
hyperactivity. such results indicate that these drugs potentially prevent
the expression of nicotine sensitization (difranza and wellman, 2007);
sensitization is thought to contribute to nicotine's addictive properties
(difranza and wellman, 2007; schoffelmeer et al., 2002). in animal
studies, nicotine sensitization is expressed behaviorally as increased

locomotor activity resulting from repeated administrations of nicotine.
miller et al. (2001) found that nicotine sensitization developed after only
four nicotine exposures even with each exposure being separated by one
week. that study also showed that  xxxd2550xxx  blocked the expression
of nicotine-induced behavioral sensitization. we extend these results to
show that  xxxd2550xxx  can block nicotine-induced hyperactivity in a
pavlovian drug discrimination task with chronic nicotine exposure.
using a two-lever drug discrimination procedure where rats were
trained to discriminate 0.2 mg/kg nicotine from vehicle shoaib et al.
(2000) found that 5 mg/kg dhbetae blocked the sd effects of nicotine for up
to 45 min. our study found that a higher and lower dose of dhbetae
(3 or 10 mg/kg), and  xxxd2550xxx  (1 or 2 mg/kg) partially antagonized the cs effects of nicotine when administered 5 min before testing.
 xxxd2550xxx  still fully antagonized the nicotine cs at 200 min,
whereas dhbetae only partially antagonized at this latest time point. these
results indicate that  xxxd2550xxx  is behaviorally effective longer than
dhbetae. we have also shown that systemic administration of  xxxd2550xxx  can fully block the stimulus effects of intravenous administration
of nicotine for a 2 h session (murray and bevins, 2009). knowing that
 xxxd2550xxx  and dhbetae have a long duration of behavioral effectiveness allows the use of these drugs in lengthy behavioral tasks.
mla did not antagonize nicotine-evoked conditioned responding at
any dose. research by turek et al. (1995) found that systemic
administration of mla crosses the blood–brain barrier in the rat, and we
showed a signiﬁcant decrease in general chamber activity at the 5 mg/kg
dose. thus, it seems unlikely that the inability of mla to affect the
conditioned stimulus effects of nicotine reﬂects an inability of this drug to
cross the blood–brain barrier. consistent with the present research, brioni
et al. (1996) tested mla systemically and intra-cerebroventricularly in a
two-lever drug discrimination task with nicotine and found no
substitution or antagonism with either route of administration. overall,
it appears that alpha7* nachrs do not play a role in the interoceptive stimulus
effects of nicotine.
we also evaluated the effects of two novel compounds, bpiddb and
bpidi, to antagonize the conditional stimulus effects of nicotine. these
compounds appear to block nachr subtypes involved in mediating
nicotine-evoked dopamine release (e.g., alpha6beta2; dwoskin et al., 2004,
2008). in vivo microdialysis in the nucleus accumbens has demonstrated that bpiddb attenuated nicotine-evoked dopamine overﬂow (rahman et al., 2007). neugebauer et al. (2006) showed that bpiddb dosedependently decreased nicotine self-administration. dwoskin et al.
(2008), however, found that bpiddb had no effect on the nicotine sd.
our results are consistent with those of the operant drug discrimination
task in that bpiddb did not block nicotine-evoked conditioned
responding. the differential effects seen between self-administration
and drug discrimination suggest that nachr subtypes that mediate
nicotine-evoked dopamine release do not play a signiﬁcant role in the
neuropharmacological mechanisms involved in the conditional or the
discriminative stimulus effects of nicotine. this interpretation is
consistent with murray and bevins (2007a), in which the two dopamine
antagonists sch-23390 and eticlopride did not block the cs effects of
nicotine. the highest bpidi dose signiﬁcantly decreased nicotine-evoked
conditioned responding. however, at that same dose chamber activity
dropped signiﬁcantly below saline indicating a locomotor impairment
effect.
glick et al. (2002) used low dose combinations of drugs that have
common action at alpha3beta4* nachrs ( xxxd2550xxx , dextromethorphan, bupropion, and another compound synthesized in his laboratory [18-methoxycoronaridine]) on nicotine self-administration. in
that study, rats were trained to self-administer nicotine (0.028 mg/kg/
infusion) and then tested with each drug alone (0.1 mg/kg  xxxd2550xxx , 0.5 mg/kg dextromethorphan, 5 mg/kg bupropion, 0.5 mg/kg
18-methoxycoronaridine) and with each low dose combination. no
drug had any effect on self-administration behavior when administered alone. however, all low dose drug combinations signiﬁcantly
decreased the number of nicotine infusions per hour. these authors

a.m. struthers et al. / pharmacology, biochemistry and behavior 94 (2009) 319–328

concluded that there was additive antagonism at alpha3beta4⁎ receptors
indicating its importance to the underlying neural mechanisms in
nicotine self-administration behavior. given that experiment 1
showed full antagonism with  xxxd2550xxx  and that  xxxd2550xxx 
has a somewhat higher afﬁnity for alpha3beta4* nachrs (cf. papke et al.,
2001), we adopted the same strategy as glick et al. (2002) in experiment 2
and used low dose combinations of  xxxd2550xxx , dextromethorphan,
and bupropion. although each drug acts at non-nachrs, there was no
overlap in action except at alpha3beta4* nachr subtype.
before any low dose combination testing we evaluated dextromethorphan antagonism;  xxxd2550xxx  and bupropion antagonism
had previously been established using our discrimination procedures
(besheer et al., 2004; wilkinson et al., 2009). dextromethorphan
partially blocked nicotine-evoked conditioned responding at the 10
and 20 mg/kg doses. higher doses were not tested because of
cutaneous toxicity. these results differ from those of zakharova
et al. (2005) in which dextromethorphan had no effect on the sd
effects nicotine. when tested alone, bupropion (5 mg/kg) increased
nicotine-evoked conditioned responding in substitution and antagonism tests, but not when bupropion was tested in combination with
 xxxd2550xxx  and dextromethorphan. perhaps, the  xxxd2550xxx 
and dextromethorphan blocked bupropion's increase in nicotineevoked conditioned responding. although combinations that included
bupropion did not decrease nicotine-evoked conditioned responding,
the 0.1 mg/kg  xxxd2550xxx  and 1 mg/kg dextromethorphan combination did partially block nicotine-evoked conditioned responding.
this ﬁnding may reﬂect a partial role for alpha3beta4* nachrs on the cs
effects of nicotine. however, further research investigating other drug
dose combinations, or more selective antagonists, is needed before
fully accepting this interpretation.
in sum, these data indicate that  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx * and alpha3beta4* nachrs potentially
play a role in the cs effects of nicotine. however, it is important to note
that our data also suggests that the contribution of alpha3beta4* nachrs may be
minor and less than that of  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx * nachrs. these results suggest that  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx * and
alpha3beta4* nachr subtypes are potential targets of subsequent pharmacotherapy development for the treatment of nicotine addiction. given the
noncompetitive binding action of  xxxd2550xxx , the fact that it has
greater selectivity at alpha3beta4* nachrs, and that it has longer lasting effects
than dhbetae, may be a drug of interest for the treatment of nicotine
addiction at low doses. research has shown that  xxxd2550xxx  blocks
the physiological effects of nicotine at low doses without precipitating
withdrawal (shytle et al., 2002; siu and tyndale, 2007). rose et al. (1994)
has demonstrated that a  xxxd2550xxx – xxxd2721xxx  combination was
more effective in the treatment of nicotine addiction than the nicotine
patch alone. given that low dose drug combinations targeting alpha3beta4*
nachrs signiﬁcantly reduced the rewarding effects of nicotine (e.g.,
nicotine self-administration) and partially blocked the conditional
stimulus effects of nicotine, there is a need to develop better ligands for
this receptor subtype.
