(fetal rat lung)

the role of lysosomaf enzyme acid a-glucosidase in fetal lung development was investigated with the aid of a
specific inhibitor, the pseudosaccharide acarbose. the drug was added to a waymouth culture medium of
fetal rat lung explants cultivated for 48 h from gestational stage 19.5 days, an in vitro system previously
shown to allow morphological and biochemical maturation of alveolar epithelium. glycogenolysis was
reduced by 40% as compared with tissue cultivated on control medium, which means that a-glucosidase could
account for as much as 40% of fetal lung glycogenolysis, the remaining 60% being presumably achieved by
cytosolic phosphorylase and by a microsomaf neutral a-glucosidase. by the same time, the increase of
phospholipids of surfactant fraction extracted from cultivated explants was partially inhibited: total and
saturated phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol were
about 30-m
lower than in lungs cultivated on control medium. it should be emphasized that dna
concentration and increases in non-surfactant phospholipids were unchanged by the drug. a-glucosidase
activity was evidenced in the lysosomaf fraction, in the microsomal fraction and, although in lower amounts,
in the surfactant fraction extracted from term fetal lung. the results suggest that lysosomal a-glucosidase
plays a major role in lung maturation and could facilitate glycogenolysis for the specific use of glycogen
stores in providing substrates for surfactant phospholipid biosynthesis.

introduction
glycogen stored in fetal lung at earlier stages is
utilized at the time when surfactant
biosynthesis
surges [l--4]. a precursor-product
relationship
between glycogen and lung lipids, more especially
surfactant phospholipids,
has been evidenced [5,6]
and as much as 25% of glycogen stores could be
used for providing
carbon for the glycerol and
fatty acid backbone during lipid synthesis by the
maturing lung [6].
the lysosomal enzyme, acid a-glucosidase
or
amyloglucosidase,
had previously
been found in

fetal rat lung [4,7] and its implication
in maturational processes had been demonstrated
[4]. however, the precise function of this enzyme in the
developing
lung and the respective roles of acid
a-glucosidase
and phosphorylase
in lung glycogen
breakdown
remained
unknown.
the use of
acarbose (bay g 5421), an inhibitor of acid a-glucosidase which reproduces
in rats a syndrome
similar to type ii glycogenosis
[8,9], facilitates
investigation
of these questions.
because of the
limited availability
of acarbose, its effects on lung
development
were studied in vitro on rat fetal lung
organ cultures, a system previously shown to allow
type ii pneumocyte
differentiation
and surfactant
accumulation
in various species [lo-131.

lation of phospholipids,
both in a surfactant fraction isolated by frosolono’s
method [14] and in
residual (non-surfactant)
fraction. to analyze further the specificity of acarbose effects, the activity
of acid a-glucosidase
and of glycogen phosphorylase was determined in lung explants at the end of
the cultivation
period. because of the lysosomalrelated origin of lamellar bodies [2,15], acid cu-glucosidase activity was sought in the lamellar-bodyenriched surfactant fraction and was documented
in subcellular
fractions, including
purified lysosomes.
the results presented argue for a proportionally
important
role of acid ar-glucosidase in fetal lung
glycogenolysis
and for a specific role in glycogen
utilization
for surfactant-phospholipid
biosynthesis.
material and methods
explant culture preparation
wistar rats obtained from centre d’elevage r.
janvier (st. berthevin,
mayenne,
france), were
mated overnight and pregnancies
were dated as
described previously [4].
on day 19.5 of gestation, the stage when glycogen accumulation
is maximum
[3,4], rats were
killed by a blow to the head, and fetuses rapidly
delivered by cesarean section under aseptic conditions. fetal lungs were immediately
removed and
pooled
in ice-chilled
waymouth
mb752/1
medium. four or five litters were pooled for each
culture experiment. fetal lungs were then cut into
0.7 mm edge pieces with aid of a mcillwain tissue
chopper (mickle lab. eng. co., gomshall, u.k.).
they were again transferred to ice-chilled medium
until being plated on top of a semi-solid culture
medium according
to the method described for
allowing optimal conditions
for surfactant
biosynthesis
in vitro [16]. in brief, 3 ~01s. of
waymouth
medium (eurobio, paris, france) containing 250 iu/ml penicillin and 10 ng/ml streptomycin were mixed with 1 vol. of heated agar
solution
(2% agar in krebs-ringer
bicarbonate
solution). when still warm, the mix was dispensed
to lindbro (flow laboratories
inc., hamden, ct)
multi-well plates and allowed to gel. waymouth
medium was chosen because it allows a glycogenolytic rate in vitro close to that in vivo (see results).

acarbose was added to the culture medium at a
final concentration
of 1 mg/ml.
osmolarity
was
adjusted in the control medium by addition
of
0.25 mg of glucose per ml, since the molecular
weight of acarbose is approx. 4-fold that of glucose (this represented
a 5% increase in glucose
concentration).
in a few experiments,
the biologically inert mannitol was added in place of glucose;
no difference
was observed in glycogen breakdown or in phospholipid
synthesis. at the end of
culture initiation,
remaining explants were frozen
and kept for determination
of initial state parameters.

co, (air liquide co, vitry,
france) at 37°c. they were then harvested and
frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at - 25’c
pending biochemical analysis. explants were taken
at random in a same culture experiment
for determining either glycogen or phospholipids.
culture media were provided by eurobio (paris,
france).
agar,
glucose
and
mannitol
were
purchased from sigma (st. louis,mo). acarbose
was a gift of dr. puls (bayer, leverkusen, f.r.g.).
subcellular fractionation techniques
the surfactant fraction was isolated by discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugations
by the method initially described by frosolono et
al. [14], revised by sanders and longmore [17] and
adapted to small-size biological samples [18]. the
surfactant
fraction was isolated from cultivated
lung explants for phospholipid
analyses and from
the lung of 21.5-day-old fetuses for determination
of acid a-glucosidase
activity. lysosomes
were
purified
from the lung of 21.5-day-old
fetuses
according to hook and gilmore [19]. mitochondria
and microsomes were isolated according to harding et al. [20].
biochemical analyses
glycogen
was assayed on lung tissue homogenate by the amyloglucosidase
method of chan
and exton [21] using oyster glycogen (sigma) as a
standard
and the god-perid
kit of boehringer
(mannheim,
f.r.g.) for glucose determination.
lipids were extracted overnight from surfactant
and residual fractions using the method of bligh
and
dyer [22]. 14c-labelled

(amersham

after drying
and
resolubilization
in chloroform/
methanol
(2: 1, v/v), an aliquot was taken for total phospholipid determination,
and the rest was plated on
silica-gel-60 precoated plates (merck, darmstadt,
f.r.g.) for phospholipids
separation
by two-dimensional
thin-layer
chromatography
as previously described
[5]. phospholipid
spots were
scraped and eluted by the method of bligh and
dyer [22]. total phosphatidylcholine
(pc) was
divided into three aliquots for determination
of
phosphorus,
radioactivity
and disaturated
pc by
the osmium tetroxide method of mason et al. [23].
inorganic
phosphate
was determined
on ashed
phospholipid
samples by the method of ames and
dubin [24].
acid amyloglucosidase
(p-nitrophenylglucosidase,  xxxg826xxx ) activity was assayed according
to torres and olavarria [25] by determining
the
speed of p-nitrophenyl
a-glucoside
(sigma) hydrolysis at ph 4.8. this ph has been shown to be
optimal for the purified hepatic enzyme [25]. pnitrophenylglucosidase
activity
was also determined
in lung homogenates
at ph 7.4. the
reactive
mix comprised
5 mm p-nitrophenylglucoside, 0.06% triton x-100 and lung homogenate in distilled
water, with the appropriate
acetate or phosphate buffer, ph 4.8 or 7.4, respectively. phosphorylase
a activity ( xxxg909xxx   xxxg2386xxx .1) was
assayed by the method of hue et al. [26], measuring the release of inorganic phosphate
from glucose l-phosphate.
proteins were determined by the
method of schacterle and pollack [27] using bovine
 xxxg124xxx  (fraction v, sigma) as a standard.
dna was assayed by the diphenylamine
method
of burton [28] using calf thymus dna (sigma as a
reference.

results
acid a-glucosidase activity at different acarbose
concentrations
a-glucosidase
activity was assayed in total lung
homogenates
of 21.5-day-old
fetuses, in the presence of acarbose at a final concentration
varying
from 10e5 to 5 mg per ml reactive mix, at ph 4.8
and 7.4. p-nitrophenyl
a-glucoside hydrolytic activity measured at ph 7.4 in absence of acarbose
was about 1.5-times higher than that determined
at ph 4.8 (63.5 vs. 39.5 nmol/mg
protein per h in
homogenates
used for this study). at ph 4.8,
acarbose exerted a significant inhibition
already at
a concentration
of lo-’
mg/ml;
the percentage
of inhibition
increased slightly until 10e3 mg/ml,
then increased abruptly to reach total inhibition
between lop2 and 10-l mg/ml (fig. 1). by ‘contrast, acarbose exerted low inhibition
on the activity measured at ph 7.4; no inhibition was detected
below 1o-2 mg/ml and it was only about 50% at
5 mg/ml.
obviously, the activities determined
at
ph 4.8 and 7.4 must correspond
to distinct
enzymes, presumably
to the so-called ‘acid’ (lysosomal) and ‘neutral’
(microsomal)
glucosidases
previously
evidenced
in liver [25]. effects of
acarbose in culture experiments reported below (1
mg/ml culture medium) appear therefore as consequences of the inhibition
of the acid form of the
enzyme.

choice of culture medium
in a preliminary
set of experiments, glycogenolytic rate in-vitro was determined in five different
commercial
media
(waymouth
mb 752/l,
dulbecco’s modified minimum essential medium,
cmrl 1066, ham’s f12k and rpm1 1640). results are reported in fig. 2. it should be recalled
that the glycogen concentration
in fetal rat lung
peaks at 19.5 days, decreases slightly between this
stage and 20.5 days, then sharply thereafter [3,4].
ideally, a culture condition would reproduce that
glycogenolytic
rate occurring in vivo. in fact, glycogenolysis was faster in vitro than in vivo with all
media. waymouth
medium was the one allowing
the slowest glycogenolytic
rate, the least different
from the in vivo rate. since waymouth
medium
was shown in previous experiments [16] to support
an in vitro accretion of surfactant
phospholipids
of the same order as that occurring in vivo during
the same period, it was chosen for studying the
effects of acarbose.
dna in cultivated explants (table i)
dna concentration
did not change significantly during culture, either in presence or absence of acarbose. this was in keeping with previous observations

effects of acarbose upon glycogenolysis in vitro (table i)
about 62% of the initial glycogen content of
the explants was broken down during the 48 h of
cultivation
in control medium.
in presence
of
acarbose, glycogenolysis was partly prevented, and
only 38% of initial glycogen were utilized on the
average. this effect was constant
in the eight
culture experiments
performed, with very low deviation
from the mean value. in other words,
acarbose induced a 40% inhibition of glycogenolysis.

the highest yield was in

discussion
the results reported here show that acarbose, a
pseudosaccharide
which was reported to inhibit
the lysosomal enzyme acid a-glucosidase
[9,29,30],
inhibited
glycogenolysis
in fetal lung organ cultures by 40%. if the inhibition
was specific, this
means that acid a-glucosidase
could account for
no less than 40% of glycogen breakdown
in the
culture conditions which were used. it could even
account for more, since the enzyme activity was
probably
not totally inhibited
in fetal lung explants, as indicated by enzyme assays performed
at the end of culture period. indeed, a neutral
microsomal
a-glucosidase
activity also exists in
the lung
as confirmed
by the potent
pnitrophenylglucosidase
activity evidenced
at ph
7.4, but acarbose exerted a weak inhibiting
effect
on this activity when added to the reaction mixture, as compared to inhibition
at ph 4.8. it was
therefore
probably
the acid lysosomal
enzyme
which was primarily inhibited by acarbose in culture experiments
at the concentration
used. in
addition, previous observations
dealing with liver
glycogen clearly indicated
that acarbose slowed
down degradation
of glycogen within the lysosomal compartment,
whereas mobilization
of extra-lysosomal
glycogen stores was accelerated 191.
it is remarkable
that phosphorylase
activity in
lung explants was unchanged
by acarbose. phosphorylase, the activity of which was reported to
increase in fetal rat lung near term [3,4], and
possibly the neutral ar-glucosidase would therefore
account for the rest of the glycogenolysis.
taken
together, these observations
argue for the specificity of acarbose effects, and lysosomal
a-glucosidase appears to play a major role from a quantitative point of view in lung glycogenolysis
during
lung maturation.
by the same time, acarbose inhibited
the increase in surfactant
phospholipids
occurring
in
lung explants. this is consistent
with the previ-

ously reported [5,6] utilization
of glycogen stores
as a precursor pool for biosynthesis
of phospholipids in developing
lung. it seems likely that
surfactant
phospholipid
synthesis was decreased
because of decreased availability
of substrates resulting from impaired
glycogenolysis.
nevertheless, other mechanisms
could also be involved.
ceddes and taylor (91 indicated
that acarbose
somewhat decreased acid phosphatase
activity in
the liver. taking into account the importance
of
protein phosphorylation
in cell metabolism,
this
might influence lung maturational
processes. the
absence of change in the phosphorylase
activity,
however, argues against this assumption,
since
protein phosphatase activities are directly involved
in regulatory
processes of glycogen metabolism
through the phosphorolytic
pathway. the absence
of significant
changes in in vitro biosynthesis
of
non-surfactant
phospholipids
also argues against
this mechanism and suggests that glycogen utilization mediated
by a-glucosidase
is specific to
surfactant-phospholipid
biosynthesis.
the much
higher rate of surfactant
increase in vitro might,
however, have apparently
increased the in~bitory
effect as compared with the residual fraction.
it should be underlined
that the glucose in the
culture medium, despite its high concentration
(5
mg/ml) did not appear to compensate
the deficit
of glycogenolysis.
this may appear surmising,
since a-glucosidase
releases free glucose, which as
that taken up from medium, must first be phosphorylated to be metabolized
further. this preferential use of glucose from glycogen had already
been evidenced in culture experiments
in which
glycogenolysis had been prevented by high glucose
concentration
and insulin in the medium [s]. there
is at present no explanation
of this phenomenon,
but compartmentalization
of glucose inside the
type ii pneumonocyte
is possible assuming that
glucose issued from glycogen hydrolysis belongs to
a pool different from that of glucose from the
medium. from a teleological point of view, this
could correspond
to the necessity of access to a
large precursor pool represented by glycogen stores
inside the cell at a stage when the developing
pneumonocyte
is separated from capillary vessels
by several layers of mesenchymal
cells [31], a
situation
which could limit the accessibility
to
circulating
substrates.
in addition,
it has been

209

shown that from the 19th to the 21st day of
is
gestation,
i.e., at the stages when surfactant
accumulating,
glucose incorporation
into dspc
increases at a rate much lower than that of dspc
synthesis measured
by choline incorporation
in
fetal rat lung slices [32]. furthermore,
exogenous
glucose appears to be used 3-5-times
more as an
energy substrate than as a precursor substrate for
lipogenesis by fetal rat lung [32]. this argues for a
need for other precursor substrates, among which
is glycogen.
on the whole, as far as the observations
above
can be extended
to in vivo processes, one can
assume that surfactant biosynthesis requires cy-glucosidase action for providing
precursors.
phosphorylase-mediated
and
neutral
amyloglucosidase-mediated
glycogenolysis
could also
provide precursors, but their alternative
function
would be to provide energy and reduced coenzymes for lipid biosynthesis
through glycolysis [3].
the involvement
of cu-glucosidase in providing
substrates for surfactant biosynthesis
and a possible different role of phosphorylase
are still suggested by morphological
evidence. lamellar bodies, the intracellular
form of surfactant, have been
shown to appear in close spatial relationship
with
glycogen patches in differentiating
type ii cell [2].
in fetal monkeys, glycogen has even been demonstrated inside lamellar bodies [33]. this is in keeping with the probable lysosomal origin of lamellar
bodies and of their precursors, multivesicular
bodies [2,15,34], with the presence of a-glucosidase
activity in purified lamellar bodies [19,35] and
with our finding
of a-glucosidase
activity
in
surfactant fraction. other lysosomal enzyme activities have also been evidenced in lamellar bodies
[19,34,35]. two distinct
a-glucosidase
activities
have been identified in human lung lamellar bodies [35]. it is likely that the activity determined
here corresponds
to the major specific acid a-glucosidase previously
evidenced
[35]. taking into
account the facts that the proportion
of cy-glucosidase activity present in the surfactant fraction is
low, and that lamellar bodies do not seem to
possess the complete enzyme equipment necessary
for phospholipid
biosynthesis
[36,37], it seems unlikely that a major part of glycogen breakdown
and utilization would occur in the lamellar bodies
themselves. however, it should be emphasized that

the surfactant
fraction derives only from type ii
pneumonocytes,
whereas other fractions represent
all lung cell types. considering
the cellular heterogeneity of lung and the relatively small number
of type ii cells, amyloglucosidase
activity
in
surfactant
fraction could represent a larger proportion of total activity in type ii pneumonocytes.
although total activity in each subcellular fraction
was probably not recovered, the highest yield was
in purified lysosomes and microsomes.
this suggests the probable implication
of secondary lysosomes, of endoplasmic
reticulum, and possibly of
multivesicular
bodies in cr-glucosidase-mediated
glycogenolysis.

on their fate therefore appears likely, which would explain the above presumed existence of different glucose pools.
in conclusion,
the present work suggests that
lysosomal a-glucosidase
plays a major role in lung
maturation
in exploiting of glycogen stores at a
local level specifically for providing precursor substrates for surfactant phospholipid
biosynthesis.
