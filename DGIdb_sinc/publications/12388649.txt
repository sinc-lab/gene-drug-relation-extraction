clinical and epidemiological evidence has linked smoking
and depression. the incidence of major depression is higher
among smokers than nonsmokers (glassman, 1993; kendler
et al., 1993; breslau et al., 1998). the likelihood of successful
smoking cessation decreases in those individuals with a history of major depression or depressive symptoms at the initiation of smoking cessation (hall et al., 1991; glassman,
1993). furthermore, depressive symptoms associated with
nicotine withdrawal are more severe in depressed patients
compared with patients without histories or symptoms of
depression (glassman, 1993). the onset of smoking cessation
may initiate an acute depressive episode in certain individuals (stage et al., 1996; covey et al., 1997). furthermore,
nicotine has been reported to have antidepressant properties
in depressed individuals (glassman, 1993; salin-pascual and
drucker-colin, 1998) and in animal models of depression
funding to support these studies was provided by the pharmacia corporation. a.s.r. was supported by a national institutes of health training grant
(t32 da07304).

administration of  xxxd3089xxx  (5.6 mg/kg) to alter nicotine-induced hyperactivity (0.8 mg/kg).  xxxd3089xxx , (⫹)-(s,s)- xxxd3089xxx , and  xxxd2550xxx  dose dependently decreased nicotine self-administration by ⬃60%, whereas  xxxd3089xxx  and (⫹)(s,s)- xxxd3089xxx  decreased sucrose-maintained responding to
a lesser extent (⬃20%). repeated administration of  xxxd3089xxx 
(5.6 mg/kg) decreased nicotine self-administration and sucrose-maintained responding across the 14 sessions, suggesting that tolerance did not develop to these effects of  xxxd3089xxx . additionally,  xxxd3089xxx  did not alter baseline locomotor
activity, indicating that the decrease in operant responding for
nicotine and sucrose was not the result of a nonspecific decrease in activity. the  xxxd3089xxx -induced decrease in nicotine
self-administration and sucrose-maintained responding may be
the result of inhibition of norepinephrine transporters and/or
neuronal nicotinic receptor function.

(tizabi et al., 1999). such evidence has led to the self-medication hypothesis of nicotine dependence, such that individuals may use tobacco, at least in part, to ameliorate depression or depressive symptoms (markou et al., 1998).
the self-medication hypothesis of nicotine dependence is further strengthened by the observation that the antidepressant,
bupropion, serves as an efficacious smoking cessation pharmacotherapy (ferry et al., 1992; hurt et al., 1997; jorenby et al.,
1999). the pharmacological mechanism of action by which bupropion reduces smoking has not been elucidated but has been
attributed to inhibition of both dopamine and norepinephrine
transporters (ferris et al., 1983; shiffman et al., 2000). however, bupropion has been reported recently to also act as a
noncompetitive antagonist at nicotinic receptors (nachrs), and
in this respect, nachr antagonism may contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of bupropion as a smoking cessation agent
(slemmer et al., 2000; miller et al., 2002a).
since bupropion acts as an inhibitor of dopamine and norepinephrine transporters as well as nachrs, it was of interest to assess the potential utility of  xxxd3089xxx  as a smoking
cessation agent.  xxxd3089xxx  is an efficacious and well toler-

abstract
the ability of  xxxd3089xxx , a selective inhibitor of the  xxxg2148xxx  and noncompetitive antagonist at neuronal nicotinic receptors, to alter nicotine self-administration in rats was
compared with that of  xxxd2550xxx , a classical noncompetitive antagonist at nicotinic receptors. the ability of  xxxd3089xxx 
to alter sucrose-maintained responding was also examined to
assess the specificity of the effect on nicotine self-administration. rats were trained on a fixed ratio 5 schedule to selfadminister nicotine (0.02 mg/kg/infusion i.v.) or to respond for
sucrose pellets. upon reaching a stable baseline, rats were
pretreated 15 min before the session with vehicle,  xxxd3089xxx 
(racemic), (⫹)-(s,s)- xxxd3089xxx  (0.3–30 mg/kg s.c.) or
 xxxd2550xxx  (0.5– 4 mg/kg s.c). to assess the effect of repeated administration,  xxxd3089xxx  (5.6 mg/kg) was injected
once daily for 14 consecutive sessions before either nicotine
self-administration or sucrose-maintained responding. specificity was further assessed by examining the ability of repeated

materials and methods
subjects
male sprague-dawley rats (from 200 to 225 g at the start of the
experiment) were obtained from harlan (indianapolis, in). upon
arrival, the rats were acclimated to the animal colony for at least 5
days and subsequently were handled daily for 3 to 5 days before the
start of the experiment. in the sucrose-maintained responding experiments, rats were reduced to 85% of their ad libitum body weight.
for the nicotine self-administration experiments, rats were initially
reduced to 85% of their ad libitum body weights for lever-press
training. once such training was completed, the rats were allowed ad
libitum access to food in preparation for surgery. during the selfadministration phase, the rats were food-restricted (i.e., given 15–20
g of rat chow after each daily session). in all experiments, the rats
received ad libitum access to water in the home cage and were
maintained on a light/dark cycle in which the lights were on at 6:00
a.m. and off at 8:00 p.m. rats were drug-naive at the start of each
experiment and received only the drug pretreatment specified in
each experiment. the institutional animal care and use committee
of the university of kentucky approved the experiments described
herein. the experiments conformed to the guidelines established by
the national institutes of health guide for the care and use of
laboratory animals (1996 edition).

drugs
s-(⫺)-nicotine ditartrate was purchased from sigma/rbi (natick,
ma) and is referred to throughout as nicotine. the nicotine solution
for i.v. self-administration was prepared in 0.9% physiological saline,
adjusted to ph 7 by addition of sodium hydroxide (5 m) solution.
nicotine was administered i.v. in a volume of 60 ␮l for the selfadministration experiments. in the locomotor activity experiment,
nicotine was given s.c. in a volume of 1 ml/kg body weight.  xxxd3089xxx  (a racemic mixture of r,r- and s,s-([2-[␣[2-ethoxyphenoxy]
benzyl]-morpholine sulfate]) and (⫹)-(s,s)- xxxd3089xxx  methanesulfon were provided by pharmacia corp. (kalamazoo, mi). the latter
drugs were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline and administered
s.c. in a volume of 1 ml/kg body weight.  xxxd2550xxx  hcl (sigma/
rbi) was prepared in 0.9% physiological saline and administered s.c.
in a volume of 1 ml/kg body weight. nicotine doses administered i.v.
or s.c. are expressed as the free base; doses of  xxxd3089xxx  and
 xxxd2550xxx  are expressed as the salt weight. morphine hcl (15
mg/kg salt weight) was prepared in saline and administered i.v. in a
volume of 1 ml/kg body weight.

apparatus
for the nicotine self-administration and sucrose-maintained responding experiments, standard rat operant conditioning chambers
(env-001; med associates, st. albans, vt) were used. the sidewalls of the chamber were aluminum, and the front and back walls
were clear plexiglas. the floor consisted of 18 stainless steel rods,
with newspaper under the floor. a recessed food tray (5 ⫻ 4.2 cm)
was located at the bottom-center of one of the sidewalls of the
chamber. response levers were located on either side of the recessed
food tray. responses made on the active lever were reinforced, and
responses made on the other, inactive lever had no scheduled consequence (i.e., were not reinforced). a 28-v cue light was located 6 cm
above each lever. completion of the fixed ratio requirement resulted
in the simultaneous activation of the cue light and either the infusion
pump or the pellet dispenser. all stimulus and response events were
controlled and recorded by a computer.
for the locomotor activity experiment, a custom-made wooden
chamber (30 ⫻ 28 ⫻ 43 cm high) was used. the interior walls of the
chamber were painted white and contained a wire-mesh floor. pine
wood-chip bedding (p. j. murphy forest products, montville, nj)
was placed in a tray beneath the floor. two photo beams, located 4
cm above the base of the floor, divided the chamber into four equal
quadrants. each break of a photo beam was scored as an activity
count and recorded by a computer located in a control room adjacent
to the test room. a speaker located in the test room provided an
ambient white noise (70 db).

general procedure
surgery. rats were anesthetized by an i.p. injection of ketamine
(80 mg/kg) and diazepam (5 mg/kg). a silastic catheter was inserted
into the jugular vein with the free end of the catheter exiting through
the skin and secured to an acrylic head mount, which was attached
to an infusion pump prior to self-administration sessions.
nicotine self-administration. nicotine self-administration
procedures were based on published methods (corrigall and coen,
1989). before commencement of behavioral testing, rats were deprived to 85% of their free-feeding body weight. rats were trained to
respond for sucrose pellets (45 mg; p. j. noyes, inc., lancaster, nh).
following lever-press training, rats were placed on a fixed ratio 1
schedule of reinforcement for one 15-min session. if rats received 20
pellets, the schedule was increased to a fixed ratio 2 for 1 session,
and subsequently to a fixed ratio 5 for 3 sessions. after the third
lever-press training session on a fixed ratio 5 schedule, rats were
allowed free access to food, and surgery was performed approximately 7 days later as described previously. following recovery from
surgery, rats were reintroduced to the operant conditioning chamber. however, responses on a fixed ratio 1 schedule resulted in i.v.

ated antidepressant in clinical use in europe (berzewdski et
al., 1997), and its therapeutic efficacy has been attributed to
selective inhibition of the  xxxg2148xxx  (montgomery, 1999; sacchetti et al., 1999; wong et al., 2000; miller
et al., 2002b). however, recent studies have shown that  xxxd3089xxx , like other antidepressants, including bupropion
(fryer and lukas, 1999; hennings et al., 1999; slemmer et
al., 2000; miller et al., 2002a), acts as a noncompetitive
inhibitor of nachrs (miller et al., 2002b).
the purpose of the present series of experiments was to
determine the ability of  xxxd3089xxx  to alter i.v. nicotine selfadministration in rats.  xxxd3089xxx  has been shown to produce a
behavioral profile characteristic of an antidepressant using several animal models (harkin et al., 1999). consistent with these
preclinical studies, several double-blind, placebo-controlled
studies have found  xxxd3089xxx  to be a clinically efficacious antidepressant with efficacy comparable to that of desipramine,
fluoxetine, and imipramine (for review, see montgomery, 1999).
in the present study, the ability of  xxxd3089xxx  and (⫹)-(s,s) xxxd3089xxx  to alter nicotine self-administration was determined.
since  xxxd3089xxx  acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of nachrs
(miller et al., 2002b), the ability of  xxxd3089xxx  to alter nicotine
self-administration was compared with that of the classic noncompetitive nachr antagonist,  xxxd2550xxx  (experiment 1).
to assess the specificity of the effects of  xxxd3089xxx  on nicotine
self-administration, the ability of  xxxd3089xxx  (racemic) and (⫹)(s,s)- xxxd3089xxx  to alter sucrose-maintained responding also
was determined (experiment 2). tolerance to the effects of  xxxd3089xxx  on nicotine self-administration and sucrose-maintained responding was evaluated after 14 daily injections of
 xxxd3089xxx  15 min before either nicotine self-administration
sessions (experiment 3) or sucrose-maintained responding sessions (experiment 4). in experiment 5, the specificity of the
effects of  xxxd3089xxx  on nicotine self-administration and sucrose-maintained responding was assessed by determining the
ability of  xxxd3089xxx  to alter nicotine-induced hyperactivity.

experiment 5: effect of repeated pretreatment with  xxxd3089xxx  and/or nicotine on locomotor activity. since  xxxd3089xxx  decreased responding for nicotine and sucrose, the ability of
 xxxd3089xxx  to inhibit nicotine-induced hyperactivity also was assessed. rats were assigned to one of four treatment groups (n ⫽
3– 4/group) that were injected with either  xxxd3089xxx  (5.6 mg/kg) or
vehicle 15 min before the session and subsequently with nicotine (0.8
mg/kg) or saline immediately before the session. at the beginning of
the experiment, each rat was injected with saline and placed in the
locomotor chamber for 60 min on two occasions to acclimate them to
the procedure and reduce novelty-induced exploration of the chamber. subsequently, rats received their respective drug pretreatments
prior to 14 consecutive, daily 60-min sessions (sessions 1–14). on
session 15, rats previously administered  xxxd3089xxx  were injected
with vehicle; otherwise, treatment proceeded as on sessions 1 to 14.
results from session 15 determined whether  xxxd3089xxx  attenuated
the development of nicotine-induced sensitization. on session 16, all
rats were injected with vehicle followed by saline, and then were
placed in the activity chamber. results from session 16 determined
whether context conditioning to nicotine occurred and whether conditioning was attenuated by  xxxd3089xxx .

data analysis
experimental procedures
experiment 1: effect of acute pretreatment with  xxxd3089xxx ,
(ⴙ)-(s,s)- xxxd3089xxx , or  xxxd2550xxx  on nicotine self-administration. groups of rats (n ⫽ 7– 8/group) were pretreated with
either vehicle,  xxxd3089xxx , (⫹)-(s,s)- xxxd3089xxx , or  xxxd2550xxx  15 to
20 min before placement in the operant conditioning chamber for nicotine self-administration. doses of  xxxd3089xxx  and (⫹)-(s,s)- xxxd3089xxx 
administered were 0.3, 1, 3, 5.6, 10, or 17 mg/kg. doses of
 xxxd2550xxx  administered were 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 mg/kg. drug doses
were administered according to a latin-square design, with each rat
being randomly assigned to a different order of dose presentation.
furthermore, different groups of rats were used to assess each pretreatment drug. following each session in which rats were pretreated with
drug, two maintenance sessions occurred in which rats were allowed to
self-administer nicotine in the absence of pretreatment. these intervening maintenance sessions allowed for elimination of the pretreatment drug and recovery of operant baseline responding.
experiment 2: effect of acute pretreatment with  xxxd3089xxx  or (ⴙ)-(s,s)- xxxd3089xxx  on sucrose-maintained responding. groups of rats (n ⫽ 6/group) were pretreated with either
vehicle,  xxxd3089xxx , or (⫹)-(s,s)- xxxd3089xxx  15 min before placement
in the operant conditioning chamber for sucrose pellet reinforcement. doses of  xxxd3089xxx  and (⫹)-(s,s)- xxxd3089xxx  were 1, 3, 5.6, 10,
17, or 30 mg/kg. doses of drug were administered according to a
latin-square design.
experiment 3: effect of repeated pretreatment with  xxxd3089xxx  on nicotine self-administration. since experiments 1 and 2
revealed no significant differences between the effect of  xxxd3089xxx  and
(⫹)-(s,s)- xxxd3089xxx , only the effect of  xxxd3089xxx  was determined in the
subsequent experiments. for 14 consecutive sessions, groups of rats
were injected with either  xxxd3089xxx  (5.6 mg/kg, n ⫽ 8) or vehicle (n ⫽
6) 15 min before the daily nicotine self-administration session. the dose
of  xxxd3089xxx  was chosen based on the results of experiment 1, which
demonstrated that the 5.6 mg/kg dose decreased nicotine self-administration by ⬃50%. to determine whether responding for nicotine returned to baseline levels 24 h after termination of  xxxd3089xxx  pretreatment, both groups of rats were injected with vehicle prior to the nicotine
self-administration on session 15.
experiment 4: effect of repeated pretreatment with  xxxd3089xxx  on sucrose-maintained responding. for 14 consecutive sessions, groups of rats (n ⫽ 7/group) were pretreated with
either  xxxd3089xxx  (5.6 mg/kg) or vehicle 15 min before the daily
sucrose-maintained responding session. subsequently, all rats received vehicle pretreatment on session 15.

for the dose-response experiments (experiments 1 and 2), a twoway mixed-design analysis of variance (anova) was conducted on
the data, expressed as percentage change scores, in which  xxxd3089xxx 
form [(⫾) versus (⫹)-(s,s)] was a between-groups factor and  xxxd3089xxx  dose was a within-subjects factor. to make direct comparisons
between  xxxd3089xxx  forms, percentage change scores were used to
control for differences in baseline rates of responding between groups
(see results). in experiment 1, a separate one-way anova was
conducted on the  xxxd2550xxx  data expressed as percentage
change scores. the percentage change scores were calculated according to the following equation: baseline number of responses ⫺ number of responses on a drug-pretreatment session/baseline number of
responses ⫻ 100. the baseline number of responses was defined as
the average number of responses of the two maintenance sessions
preceding a drug pretreatment session. for the chronic pretreatment
experiments (experiments 3 and 4), a two-way mixed-design anova
was conducted on the number of nicotine infusions with treatment
group ( xxxd3089xxx  versus vehicle) as a between-subjects factor and
session as a within-subject factor. a two-way between-groups design
anova was conducted on the locomotor activity counts emitted
following the first injection ( xxxd3089xxx  or vehicle) and following the
second injection (nicotine or saline) (experiment 5). contrasts of
interest were analyzed by correlated and independent t tests for
within-group and between-group comparisons, respectively. comparisons were considered significant at ␣ ⬍ 0.05 (two-tailed).

infusion, the cue lights were illuminated for 20 s to signal a time-out
period, during which responses were recorded but not reinforced.
the rats remained on the fixed ratio 1 schedule for approximately 7
days. during the next 14 to 21 days, the schedule of reinforcement
was increased gradually to a fixed ratio 5. before administration of a
pretreatment drug, the following criteria for stable responding on
the fixed ratio 5 schedule were required: 1) at least five infusions per
session, 2) less than 20% variability across two consecutive sessions,
and 3) a 2:1 (active/inactive lever) response ratio. the nicotine selfadministration session duration was 60 min. upon completion of the
experiment, catheter patency was verified by observing a rapid cataleptic response following an i.v. infusion of morphine (15 mg/kg).

experiments, except that rats did not undergo surgery and the session duration was 15 min. rats were trained to lever press for
sucrose pellets until they reached the fixed ratio 5 criteria for stable
responding. the criteria for drug pretreatment were similar to those
for the nicotine self-administration experiments (see above), except
that the rats were required to earn at least 10 pellets for two
consecutive sessions.

groups, the overall mean baseline number of responses on the
active lever was 88 ⴞ 2.0 responses during the 60-min session,
which is consistent with response rates previously reported for
nicotine self-administration during 60-min sessions (corrigall
and coen, 1989).
to compare directly the effects of  xxxd3089xxx  on nicotine
self-administration (60-min session) and sucrose-maintained
responding (15-min session), an analysis of responding during the first 15 min of the nicotine self-administration session was performed. when collapsed across  xxxd3089xxx  form
and dose, the overall baseline rate of responding on the active
lever on a fixed ratio 5 schedule was 34 ⫾ 0.6 (mean ⫾
s.e.m.) responses during the first 15 min of the session. both
forms of  xxxd3089xxx  were found to dose dependently decrease
nicotine self-administration [main effect of dose [f(6,78) ⫽
13.1, p ⬍ 0.001], but the two  xxxd3089xxx  forms did not differ
in this respect (i.e., neither a significant main effect of  xxxd3089xxx  form nor  xxxd3089xxx  form ⫻ dose interaction; fig. 1, top
panel). moreover, all doses of  xxxd3089xxx  (collapsed across
 xxxd3089xxx  form) decreased nicotine self-administration compared with vehicle pretreatment. the maximal effect for  xxxd3089xxx  to decrease responding for nicotine was ⬃60% relative to vehicle control. individual variability was noted in the
acute dose-response experiment. the group data were representative of a majority of the rats; however, two of the eight
rats in the group showed little or no decrease in nicotine
self-administration until doses of 10 or 17 mg/kg  xxxd3089xxx 
were administered. with respect to the group data, similar
results were obtained regardless of whether the responses
were analyzed across the first 15 min of the session or across
the entire 60-min session; however, the maximal decrease
produced by  xxxd3089xxx  across the 60-min session was only
⬃40% compared with control (data not shown).
a two-way anova followed by correlated t tests conducted
on the baseline number of responses emitted on the inactive
lever (⬃8 responses in a 60-min session) revealed that none
of the doses of  xxxd3089xxx  (collapsed across  xxxd3089xxx  forms)
decreased responding significantly on the inactive lever (data
not shown), indicating that  xxxd3089xxx  specifically decreased
operant responding for nicotine.
with respect to the group administered  xxxd2550xxx ,
the overall baseline rate of fixed ratio 5 responding on the
active lever was 91 ⫾ 2.4 (mean ⫾ s.e.m.) responses during
the 60-min session and 33 ⫾ 0.7 (mean ⫾ s.e.m.) responses
during the first 15 min of the session. baseline responding
was stable over the course of the experiment, as demonstrated by a nonsignificant effect of dose [f(4,28) ⫽ 0.68, p ⬎
0.05]. a one-way anova conducted on responding for nicotine following administration of  xxxd2550xxx  revealed a
significant main effect of dose [f(4,28) ⫽ 5.1, p ⬍ 0.01]. the
highest dose of  xxxd2550xxx  tested (4 mg/kg) produced an
⬃65% decrease in nicotine self-administration relative to
control during the first 15 min of the session (fig. 1, bottom
panel). when the data were analyzed over the entire 60-min
session, the 4 mg/kg dose of  xxxd2550xxx  decreased nicotine self-administration by ⬃60% (data not shown).
the number of baseline responses emitted on the inactive
lever was ⬃6 responses during the 60-min session. one-way
anova revealed that none of the  xxxd2550xxx  doses decreased responding on the inactive lever (data not shown), indicating that  xxxd2550xxx  specifically decreased operant responding for nicotine.

relatively flat across the dose range tested. two-way anova
revealed a main effect of dose [f(6,60) ⫽ 14.4, p ⬍ 0.001];
however, the main effect of  xxxd3089xxx  form [(⫾) versus (⫹)(s,s)] and the interaction of dose and  xxxd3089xxx  form were
not significant. when collapsed across  xxxd3089xxx  form, each
dose tested significantly decreased responding for sucrose
relative to vehicle control.

rauhut et al.

similar to the results from the self-administration experiment, analysis of sucrose-maintained responding by two-way
anova revealed that responses on the inactive lever were
not altered after administration of either  xxxd3089xxx  form,
and the interaction of  xxxd3089xxx  form ⫻ dose also was not
significant. these results suggest that doses of  xxxd3089xxx 
specifically decreased operant responding for sucrose. however, since the baseline number of responses on the inactive
lever was extremely low (⬃1 response in a 15-min session)
compared with the baseline number of responses on the active lever (⬃480 responses in a 15-min session), it may be
that  xxxd3089xxx  failed to alter responding on the inactive
lever due to a floor effect.
effect of repeated pretreatment with  xxxd3089xxx  on
nicotine self-administration (experiment 3). a  xxxd3089xxx  dose of 5.6 mg/kg was found to decrease responding for
nicotine by ⬃50% relative to control, and this dose did not alter
responding on the inactive lever (experiment 1). as such, this
 xxxd3089xxx  dose was chosen to examine the ability of repeated
 xxxd3089xxx  (given once daily for 14 sessions) to alter nicotine
self-administration (fig. 3). analysis of the data from the first
15 min of the session was similar to that for the entire 60-min
session; however, as previously observed, the  xxxd3089xxx -induced decrease in nicotine self-administration was less robust
when the entire session was included in the analysis. furthermore, the data from the first 15 min of the session were analyzed to compare the results from the self-administration experiments with those in experiments determining its effect on
sucrose-maintained responding.
two-way anova revealed a significant main effect of
treatment group [f(1,12) ⫽ 7.2, p ⬍ 0.05]; however, neither

14 pretreatment sessions. moreover, when the vehicle was
injected on session 15, the number of nicotine infusions
earned by rats previously pretreated with  xxxd3089xxx  was not
different from the control group, indicating that  xxxd3089xxx 
administration was required to maintain the decrease in
responding for nicotine. within-subject comparisons across
sessions in the  xxxd3089xxx  pretreatment group revealed no
differences in the number of infusions earned. a comparison
of the number of infusions across sessions in the control
group also revealed no significant differences.
similar to the acute  xxxd3089xxx  dose-response experiment,
individual variability was noted following repeated  xxxd3089xxx  administration (data not shown). three rats in the
group showed a  xxxd3089xxx -induced decrease in nicotine selfadministration for 14 consecutive pretreatments, suggesting
that tolerance did not develop. two rats showed an initial
 xxxd3089xxx -induced decrease in nicotine self-administration
on session 1, but tolerance occurred across subsequent sessions. two additional rats showed no decrease in responding
for nicotine on sessions 1 to 3 following  xxxd3089xxx  pretreatment but showed a dramatic decrease in responding on subsequent sessions. another rat in the group showed a decrease
in responding for nicotine during the first session but increased responding across sessions 2 to 13. collectively, these
results demonstrate that tolerance to  xxxd3089xxx  did not develop reliably across repeated administrations, although a
considerable amount of variability was apparent among individual rats.

and/or nicotine on locomotor activity (experiment 5).
because  xxxd3089xxx  (5.6 mg/kg) decreased responding when
given acutely, and the decrease was maintained following
repeated administration for both nicotine (experiment 3) and
sucrose (experiment 4) reinforcement, it may be that  xxxd3089xxx  nonselectively decreased operant responding by producing general sedation or motor impairment. also, it was of
interest to determine whether  xxxd3089xxx  attenuated nicotine-induced hyperactivity. to determine whether  xxxd3089xxx 
(5.6 mg/kg) altered activity, it was administered once daily
for 14 sessions 15 min before placement in the activity chambers, and nicotine or saline was administered immediately
before each session. a three-way anova conducted on the
activity data revealed that rats pretreated with nicotine increased locomotor activity relative to saline-pretreated rats
across sessions [f(13,130) ⫽ 13.6, p ⬍ 0.001], indicative of
sensitization. this dose of  xxxd3089xxx  did not alter basal
activity and did not alter nicotine-induced hyperactivity
across sessions (fig. 5).
a two-way anova conducted on the activity data from the
sensitization test (session 15) revealed that rats given repeated nicotine were more active than rats given repeated
saline [f(1,10) ⫽ 81.3, p ⬍ 0.001]. moreover, there was no
difference in activity between the groups that previously
received repeated nicotine, with or without repeated  xxxd3089xxx  pretreatment, indicating that this dose of  xxxd3089xxx 
did not inhibit the development of nicotine sensitization (fig.
6, top panel). additionally, a two-way anova conducted on
the data from the conditioning test (session 16, in which only
vehicle and saline injections were administered) revealed
that rats previously treated with nicotine were more active

between-group point-by-point comparisons revealed an initial ⬃30% decrease in responding relative to the control
group on session 1 (fig. 4). this decrease in responding was
maintained across the 14 sessions, except for sessions 3 to 6
(fig. 4). when the vehicle was injected on session 15, the
number of sucrose pellets earned by rats previously pretreated with  xxxd3089xxx  was not different from that of the
control group, indicating that  xxxd3089xxx  was required to
maintain the decrease in responding for sucrose. it should be
noted, however, that responding for sucrose did not differ on
days 14 and 15 for the  xxxd3089xxx  pretreatment group, suggesting some carryover effect of  xxxd3089xxx  on sucrose-maintained responding. furthermore, the lack of difference between the control and  xxxd3089xxx  groups on session 15 was
due partially to an unexpected decrease in sucrose-maintained responding in the control group on session 15. comparison of the data between session 1 and 14 within each of
the  xxxd3089xxx  pretreatment and control groups revealed
that responding increased across the 14 sessions for each
group. the apparent increase in responding in the  xxxd3089xxx 
pretreatment group does not indicate tolerance to the effect
of  xxxd3089xxx , because the same relative increase in responding was observed in the control group. thus, both betweengroup and within-subject analyses indicate that tolerance did
not develop to the  xxxd3089xxx -induced decrease in sucrosemaintained responding.

the present study demonstrates that acute pretreatment
with either  xxxd3089xxx  or (⫹)-(s,s)- xxxd3089xxx  dose dependently
decreases both nicotine self-administration and sucrose-maintained responding. although a wide range of  xxxd3089xxx  doses
was tested in the current study, the dose-response curves were
relatively flat, and complete inhibition of responding for nicotine or sucrose was not obtained. furthermore, both  xxxd3089xxx 
and (⫹)-(s,s)- xxxd3089xxx  decreased (⬃60%) nicotine self-administration to a greater extent in the first 15 min of the session
compared with that during the entire 60-min session (⬃40%).
 xxxd3089xxx  has been reported to be rapidly absorbed (tmax ⫽
⬃30 min) and then eliminated (plasma half-life ⫽ ⬃55 min) in
rats (dostert et al., 1997). in the present study,  xxxd3089xxx  was
administered 15 min before the 60-min session. as such, pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3089xxx  may in part explain the larger effect
during the first 15 min of the session as compared with the
entire 60-min session. moreover, the magnitude of the  xxxd3089xxx -induced decrease in nicotine self-administration (⬃60%)
was greater than that observed for sucrose-maintained responding (⬃20%) during comparable periods of time. however,
baseline responding for sucrose reinforcement tended to be
greater than baseline responding for nicotine reinforcement. as
such, the more robust response rate with sucrose may have
been more resistant to inhibition by  xxxd3089xxx . in general,
however, drugs more readily decrease high rates of responding
compared with low rates (phillips et al., 1991), and thus, differences in response rate do not likely explain the differential
sensitivity of the  xxxd3089xxx -induced decrease in nicotine- and
sucrose-maintained responding. therefore, the results of this
study suggest some selectivity of  xxxd3089xxx  to decrease nicotine
self-administration. alternatively, the difference in the magnitude of the  xxxd3089xxx -induced decrease between responding for
nicotine and for sucrose may reflect an inherent difference in
the role of norepinephrine and/or the interaction of norepinephrine and dopamine in nicotine and food reinforcement (di chiara et al., 1998).
after repeated administration, the ability of  xxxd3089xxx  (5.6
mg/kg) to decrease nicotine self-administration was maintained
when the data were analyzed by comparing the  xxxd3089xxx 
pretreatment group with the control group. these results suggest that tolerance did not develop to the  xxxd3089xxx -induced
decrease in nicotine self-administration. however, large individual differences were observed with respect to the effect of
repeated  xxxd3089xxx  pretreatment on nicotine self-administration.  xxxd3089xxx  also decreased responding for sucrose across 14
consecutive sessions, when the  xxxd3089xxx  pretreatment group
was compared with the control group, indicating that tolerance
also did not develop to this effect. in contrast to the decrease in
responding for nicotine across repeated  xxxd3089xxx  pretreatments, however, there was less variability among individual
rats in the  xxxd3089xxx -induced decrease in responding for sucrose. furthermore, the relative magnitude of the reboxetineinduced decrease in responding for nicotine and for sucrose was
maintained following repeated administration.
importantly, a dose of  xxxd3089xxx  (5.6 mg/kg), which de-

alter self-administration of other stimulant drugs such as amphetamine and cocaine. collectively, these results suggest that
the noradrenergic system may uniquely contribute to nicotine
reinforcement.
the present results taken together with the results of others,
however, suggest that the interaction of  xxxd3089xxx  at the  xxxg2148xxx  may not be responsible for the decrease
in nicotine self-administration. (⫹)-(s,s)- and (⫺)-(r,r)- xxxd3089xxx  have been reported to differ by ⬃20-fold in potency for
inhibition of norepinephrine uptake (ic50 values of 3.6 nm and
85 nm, respectively; dostert et al., 1997). furthermore, the
effects of  xxxd3089xxx  have been reported to result more from the
actions of (⫹)-(s,s)- compared with the (⫺)-(r,r)-enantiomer
(benedetti et al., 1995). in contrast, in the current study, no
differences were observed between the racemic and (⫹)-(s,s)forms of  xxxd3089xxx  with respect to the observed decrease in
nicotine self-administration. thus, the reported difference in
affinity at the  xxxg2148xxx , but lack of observed
difference between (⫹)-(s,s)- and racemic  xxxd3089xxx  to decrease nicotine self-administration, suggests that the  xxxg2148xxx  may not be responsible for the decrease in
nicotine self-administration.
another mechanism by which  xxxd3089xxx  may decrease nicotine self-administration is by acting as an antagonist at
nachrs.  xxxd3089xxx  has been shown to inhibit nicotine-evoked
86
rb⫹ efflux (ic50 ⫽ 650 nm), indicating functional antagonism
of the ␣4␤2* nachr subtype (miller et al., 2002b). several
gene-knockout studies have implicated the ␤2-subunit in nicotine self-administration (picciott et al., 1998; epping-jordan et
al., 1999; cordero-erausquinm et al., 2000). pharmacological
studies have also implicated the ␣4␤2* subtype in mediating
nicotine reinforcement (stolerman et al., 1997; watkins et al.,
1999; grottick et al., 2000). specifically, the competitive nicotinic receptor antagonist, dihydro-␤-erythroidine (dh␤e),
which has greater selectivity (100-fold) for the ␣4␤2* than for
the ␣7* nachr subtype (chavez-noriega et al., 1997), attenuates nicotine self-administration in rats (stolerman et al., 1997;
watkins et al., 1999; grottick et al., 2000). additionally, the
present study showed that the noncompetitive antagonist
 xxxd2550xxx  decreased nicotine self-administration, consistent with previous work (corrigall and coen, 1989; watkins et
al., 1999). thus, the ability of  xxxd3089xxx  to decrease nicotine
self-administration is consistent with inhibition of ␣4␤2*
nachr function.
 xxxd3089xxx  failed to attenuate the development of nicotineinduced locomotor sensitization. the latter finding was surprising because both competitive and noncompetitive inhibitors of nachrs (dh␤e and  xxxd2550xxx , respectively)
have been reported to attenuate the development of nicotineinduced sensitization (stolerman et al., 1997; miller et al.,
2001). however, the failure of  xxxd3089xxx  to attenuate the
development of nicotine-induced locomotor sensitization may
have been due to the use of an insufficient dose of  xxxd3089xxx 
(5.6 mg/kg) in the current study. also, methodological differences between the present study and those investigating the
effects of dh␤e and  xxxd2550xxx  (stolerman et al., 1997;
miller et al., 2001) limit direct comparisons.
in addition to the inhibitory activity of  xxxd3089xxx  at ␣4␤2*
receptors,  xxxd3089xxx  also potently (ic50 value ⫽ 7.3 nm)
inhibited nicotinic-evoked [3h]norepinephrine release from
superfused rat hippocampal slices, consistent with functional
antagonism of the ␣3␤4* nachr subtype (miller et al.,

downloaded from jpet.aspetjournals.org at aspet journals on may 22, 2015

creased responding for nicotine by ⬃50%, did not decrease
locomotor activity. additionally, repeated administration of
 xxxd3089xxx  did not inhibit the development of locomotor sensitization induced by repeated injection of nicotine, nor did it
inhibit the conditioned hyperactivity induced by repeated
nicotine. these latter results indicate that the reboxetineinduced decrease in nicotine self-administration was not due
to general sedation or motor impairment.
the reinforcing effect of nicotine is generally accepted as
being mediated by the stimulation of nachrs located on the cell
bodies and terminals of the mesolimbic dopamine system. nicotine self-administration is decreased by selective dopamine
antagonists and by lesioning the mesolimbic dopamine system,
both of which result in robust decreases in nicotine self-administration (corrigall and coen, 1991; corrigall et al., 1992). thus,
it seems likely that the  xxxd3089xxx -induced decrease in nicotine
self-administration may be due to an alteration in the activity of
the mesolimbic dopamine system. however, it is unlikely that
 xxxd3089xxx  modulates mesolimbic dopamine activity via direct
inhibition of  xxxg2149xxx  function, since  xxxd3089xxx 
has a low affinity (ic50 ⫽ 89 ␮m) for dopamine transporters
(miller et al., 2002b). moreover, after 14 days of once daily
administration of  xxxd3089xxx , the ability of  xxxd3089xxx  to inhibit
dopamine transporters is not altered (ic50 ⫽ 100 ␮m; miller et
al., 2002b), further suggesting that inhibition of dopamine
transporters was not involved in the  xxxd3089xxx -induced decrease in nicotine self-administration across 14 sessions in the
present study.
noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus send projections directly to the ventral tegmental area (phillipson, 1979)
and to the shell region of the nucleus accumbens (delfs et al.,
1998). additionally, the locus coeruleus sends indirect projections to the ventral tegmental area via the hippocampus (lindvall and bjorklund, 1983). stimulation of locus coeruleus neurons modulates the activity of ventral tegmental area dopamine
neurons (grenhoff et al., 1993), suggesting that the noradrenergic system interacts with the mesolimbic dopamine system,
potentially contributing to reward. systemic administration of
 xxxd3089xxx  has also been reported to increase norepinephrine
release in the hippocampus and frontal cortex (sacchetti et al.,
1999). in a recent report,  xxxd3089xxx  was shown to increase the
burst firing pattern, but not the average firing frequency, of
ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons; however, systemic
administration of  xxxd3089xxx  increased dopamine release in the
prefrontal cortex but, paradoxically, not in nucleus accumbens
(linner et al., 2001). since increased dopamine release in the
nucleus accumbens is generally considered critical for reward,
these observations suggest that  xxxd3089xxx  would not serve as a
reinforcer. however, if  xxxd3089xxx  exerts an inhibitory influence
on accumbal dopamine release via a modulatory noradrenergic
system, then this could be an indirect mechanism to explain the
decrease in nicotine self-administration observed in the present
study.
alternatively, the  xxxd3089xxx -induced decrease in nicotine
self-administration may be due to a direct noradrenergic mechanism. recently, it has been suggested that norepinephrine
may contribute to nicotine reinforcement (picciotto and corrigall, 2002). whereas the present study found that a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor decreased nicotine self-administration,
other studies have shown that noradrenergic antagonists (yokel and wise, 1976), reuptake inhibitors (tella, 1995), and
lesions of the noradrenergic system (roberts et al., 1977) do not

2002b). thus,  xxxd3089xxx  may also decrease nicotine selfadministration via inhibition of ␣3␤4* nachrs. furthermore, the 90-fold greater potency of  xxxd3089xxx  to inhibit
␣3␤4* receptors relative to ␣4␤2* receptors, taken together
with the current findings that  xxxd3089xxx  decreases nicotine
self-administration, but not locomotor activity, suggests that
␣3␤4* nachrs may be specifically involved in nicotine reinforcement. thus, ␣3␤4* nachrs may be a novel target for
development of new medications for smoking cessation.
interestingly, affinities for  xxxd3089xxx  enantiomers at different nachr subtypes have not been reported. the lack of
observed difference between (⫹)-(s,s)- and racemic  xxxd3089xxx  to decrease nicotine self-administration in the current
study suggests that (⫹)-(s,s)- and (⫺)-(r,r)- xxxd3089xxx  will
have similar affinity for the specific nachr subtype mediating this effect. although the specific neurochemical mechanism(s) by which  xxxd3089xxx  decreases nicotine self-administration have not been elucidated, the current findings, taken
together with the results of a recent report on the neurochemical effects of  xxxd3089xxx  (miller et al., 2002b), suggest
that  xxxd3089xxx  inhibition of ␣3␤4* nachrs, ␣4␤2* nachrs,
norepinephrine transporters, and/or a combination of interactions at these sites may play an important role.
