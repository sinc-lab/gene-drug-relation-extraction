a c-terminal segment of the v1r vasopressin receptor is unstructured in the crystal structure of its chimera with the maltose-binding protein.  the v1 vascular vasopressin receptor (v1r) is a g-protein-coupled receptor (gpcr) involved in the regulation of body-fluid osmolality, blood volume and blood pressure. signal transduction is mediated by the third intracellular loop of this seven-transmembrane protein as well as by the c-terminal cytoplasmic segment. a chimera of the maltose-binding protein (mbp) and the c-terminal segment of v1r has been cloned, expressed, purified and crystallized. the crystals belong to space group p2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 51.10, b = 66.56, c = 115.72 a, beta = 95.99 degrees. the 1.8 a crystal structure reveals the conformation of mbp and part of the linker region of this chimera, with the c-terminal segment being unstructured. this may reflect a conformational plasticity in the c-terminal segment that may be necessary for proper function of v1r.
