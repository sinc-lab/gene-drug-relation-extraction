abstract: the synthesis and structureactivity relationship of a novel series of compounds with combined eﬀects on
 xxxg1116xxx  and 5-ht1a receptors and on the serotonin (5-ht)
transporter (sert) are described. compound 5m (lu
aa21004) was the lead compound, displaying high aﬃnity for
recombinant human 5-ht1a (ki = 15 nm), 5-ht1b (ki = 33 nm),  xxxg1116xxx  (ki = 3.7 nm),  xxxg1120xxx  (ki = 19 nm), and noradrenergic
 xxxg836xxx  (ki = 46 nm) receptors, and sert (ki = 1.6 nm). compound 5m displayed antagonistic properties at  xxxg1116xxx  and  xxxg1120xxx 
receptors, partial agonist properties at 5-ht1b receptors, agonistic properties at 5-ht1a receptors, and potent inhibition of sert.
in conscious rats, 5m signiﬁcantly increased extracellular 5-ht levels in the brain after acute and 3 days of treatment. following the
3-day treatment (5 or 10 (mg/kg)/day) sert occupancies were only 43% and 57%, respectively. these characteristics indicate that
5m is a novel multimodal serotonergic compound, and 5m is currently in clinical development for major depressive disorder.

’ introduction
the approximate lifetime prevalence of major depressive
disorder (mdd) and anxiety disorders in the united states is
17% and 29%, respectively, and onset is typically in childhood
or adolescence.1 according to the world health organization’s
global burden of disease project, mdd will become the second
leading cause of disability worldwide within the next 10 years.2
pharmacotherapy for mdd and anxiety disorders has been
available since the late 1950s, when the tricyclic antidepressants
(tcas) and the  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors (maois) became clinically available. during the 1980s, the ﬁrst selective
serotonin (5-ht) reuptake inhibitors (selective sris or ssris)
were introduced and since then have become the most widely
prescribed medication for the treatment of depression and
related disorders.3 ssris such as ﬂuoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, ﬂuvoxamine, and citalopram (1) show similar eﬃcacy but
clear advantages in terms of improved tolerability and a superior
safety proﬁle compared to tcas and maois.4 the serotonin
and norepinephrine (ne) reuptake inhibitors (snris) venlafaxine, duloxetine, desvenlafaxine, and milnacipran, as well as the
allosteric serotonin reuptake inhibitor escitalopram, have been
marketed in the 1990s and during the new millennium. in
contrast to ssris, snris display modest improved eﬃcacy and
a slightly faster onset of antidepressant action but lower
tolerability.4,5 despite more than 5 decades of research, there
are still high unmet needs in the treatment of depression. for
example, the treatment with currently available antidepressants
r 2011 american chemical society

shows modest eﬃcacy, and the majority of patients with mdd
fail to achieve full remission with current therapies.6 in addition, a
relatively long time to onset of symptom relief and issues with
relapse characterize marketed antidepressants. future drugs will
also need to address cognitive impairment, pain, and drug-related
side eﬀects such as sexual dysfunction, nausea/emesis, weight
gain, and potential cardiovascular eﬀects.4
for many years, the medical community and pharmaceutical
companies have been focusing on developing superior pharmacotherapeutic strategies for the treatment of depression and
anxiety.7,8 clinical research has demonstrated that the antidepressant activity of ssris may be augmented by coadministration
of  xxxd2957xxx , an eﬀect that has been attributed to  xxxd2957xxx ’s partial
agonistic eﬀect at the  xxxg1108xxx .9,10 this observation has
inspired many pharmaceutical companies to launch research
programs with the aim of discovering designed multiple ligands
(dmls)11 with dual activity at the serotonin transporter (sert)
and the  xxxg1108xxx . other proﬁles such as triple reuptake
inhibitors [sert, ne transporter (net), and dopamine (da)
transporter (dat) inhibition] and compounds inhibiting sert
plus various combinations of 5-ht receptor subtypes have also
been pursued.7,12
at h. lundbeck a/s, dml programs were pursued with the
goal of ﬁnding a new generation of antidepressants. these were

deﬁned prior to initiation of the lead generation program (5ht2c antagonism and sri),13,14 or they emerged from the
knowledge that was generated during such programs (5-ht3
receptor antagonism,  xxxg1108xxx  agonism, and sri). the
objective of the current program was to ﬁnd a compound
that combines  xxxg1116xxx  antagonism,  xxxg1108xxx 
agonism, and sert inhibition in a single molecule and that will
exert superior antidepressant eﬀects in humans compared to
marketed drugs. recently, the term multimodal was coined for
compounds that combine at least two separate pharmacological
modes of action that complement each other in terms of eﬃcacy
or tolerability.15,16 here we describe the biological rationale for a
novel class of putative multimodal antidepressants, which is
proposed to act via diﬀerent modes of action, namely, blocking
ligand-gated ion channels ( xxxg1116xxx ) and monoamine
transporters (sert), as well as activating g-protein-coupled
receptors ( xxxg1108xxx ). sert inhibition is important for
antidepressant and anxiolytic activity.4 the simultaneous use of
an eﬃcacious  xxxg1108xxx  agonist, together with a sert
inhibitor, is expected to rapidly desensitize the inhibitory somatodendritic 5-ht1a autoreceptors and, at the same time, to
mediate part of the antidepressant eﬀect through activation of
postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors.17,18 the rationale for adding
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonism was based on preclinical studies
demonstrating that  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists eliminate the
inhibitory tonus of 5-ht3 receptors on the release of ne and
acetylcholine (acch) in the forebrain, via 5-ht3 heteroreceptors located on inhibitory  xxxd2177xxx  (gaba)ergic interneurons.1922 these studies indicate that 5-ht3
receptor antagonists may exert positive eﬀects on mood and
cognitive impairment in patients with depression. adding to this
point,  xxxg1108xxx  agonists such as buspirone (2) are used
as anxiolytics in the clinic, whereas  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists
such as ondansetron (3) are used to treat the nausea associated
with chemotherapy and have shown some success in alleviating
the gastrointestinal distress associated with ssris.23,24 interestingly, litoxetine, initially described as an ssri, was later shown to
possess antiemetic properties in ferrets that were ascribed to its
moderate  xxxg1116xxx  antagonistic properties.23 hence, a
combined  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist,  xxxg1108xxx  agonist,
and sert inhibitor was hypothesized to have the potential to
treat signiﬁcant clinical unmet needs in mdd and generalized
anxiety disorder (gad).
in a focused screening program we identiﬁed the arylpiperazine 4b and a number of structural analogues as a lead series.
arylpiperazines are well-known motifs that are typically found in
compounds possessing activities toward a broad range of targets,
including various 5-ht receptor subtypes. for example, some
1-(2-phenoxyaryl)piperazines, although structurally similar to
our lead series, were recently found to display a slightly diﬀerent
pharmacological proﬁle, such as high  xxxg1108xxx  aﬃnity
but only modest sert inhibition.25 this and other examples
indicate that the design of molecules, interacting in a predeﬁned
manner with three diﬀerent target classes (i.e., ligand-gated ion
channels, g-protein-coupled receptors, and monoamine transporters), will be challenging, and it was also anticipated that
compounds fulﬁlling our design hypothesis might well interact
with additional targets in a subsequent broader target proﬁling.
indeed, we found that compound 4b displays moderate human
(h)  xxxg1116xxx  receptor aﬃnity, very weak h5-ht1a receptor
aﬃnity, and potent rat (r) sert inhibition (table 1), as well
as high aﬃnity (ki < 100 nm) for h5-ht2c and  xxxg1991xxx  receptors

article

(data not shown). structurally closely related members of the
series displayed substantially higher aﬃnity for h5-ht3a and/or
h5-ht1a receptors (table 1). in contrast to compound 4b, some
of the analogues showed good human microsomal stability and/
or minimal cytochrome p450 (cyp450) enzyme inhibition (data
not shown). thus, the series was a useful starting point for a
number of dml programs, including the structureactivity
relationship (sar) studies reported herein that led to the
discovery of 5m (chart 1).

’ results
chemistry. several different strategies were employed for the
synthesis of the target compounds 46. the compound class
was initially prepared by solid-phase synthesis in order to
generate compound libraries for lead discovery programs. the
key step of this synthetic strategy was the generation of aromatic
carbonheteroatom bonds through iron-assisted nucleophilic
aromatic substitution.26,27 this was a suitable method for the
preparation of focused libraries in a short space of time. however,
a different approach was necessary in order to synthesize such
molecules in larger quantities and in order to prepare molecules
with a more complex substitution pattern on the central benzene
ring. for this purpose, the target compounds were synthesized
either by two sequential palladium-catalyzed carbonheteroatom bond formations28,29 (methods a and b, schemes 1 and 2)
or through cyclization of anilines with bis(2-bromoethyl)amine
(method c). in method a, the synthesis started from 2-bromosubstituted n-phenylpiperazines 7 that were readily available in
multigram quantities through a selective monoamination of
dihalogenated benzenes.30 the thioether linkage was subsequently formed using the method reported by schopfer and
schlapbach.31 in the analogous method b, the order of steps was
reversed. for both strategies, the required starting materials,
halogenated benzenes, were either commercially available or
could be readily obtained from the corresponding anilines.
finally, the resulting tert-butyloxycarbonyl (boc)-protected
intermediates were deprotected to give the target molecules
46 as their hydrochloride salts. overall, method b turned out
to be more practical than methods a and c, since the bocprotected target molecules were easily separated by chromatography from unreacted diaryl sulfides and hydrodebrominated
byproducts.
structureactivity relationship studies. the affinities of
target compounds 46 for the cloned h5-ht3a and h5-ht1a
receptors were determined by use of in vitro binding competition
assays with membranes prepared from cells expressing the
relevant receptors, and data are reported as ki values (see
supporting information for pki ( sem values). the inhibition
of uptake of [3h]5-ht, [3h]ne, and [3h]da into rat brain
synaptosomes through the monoamine transporters was also
measured, and data are reported as mean ic50 values (see
supporting information for pic50 ( sd/sem values) of at least
two independent determinations. these data are shown in
tables 13 and 5, along with the structure of the compounds.
while affinity measures were used at the cloned h5-ht3a and h5ht1a receptors, for historical reasons a functional readout
was used as the sar driving assay for assessing potency at
the sert. internal data and literature data, however, have
demonstrated a close correlation between affinity at  xxxg2150xxx 
and potency in [3h]5-ht uptake assays, suggesting that values
are comparable.32 the compounds were prioritized for further

it has been demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical studies

that a relatively high  xxxg2150xxx  occupancy of around 8090% is
required for ssris and snris to exert an antidepressant
activity.3335 in contrast, the relationship between the in vivo

occupancy in experimental animals and humans and the efficacy
at 5-ht3 and 5-ht1a receptors is less well described. however,
receptor occupancies of >50% have been reported for the
antiemetic activity of  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists including
ondansetron (3),36 whereas much lower receptor occupancies
have been estimated to be efficacious for buspirone (2) at
5-ht1a receptors.3739 hence, compounds were selected that
displayed relative affinities/potencies (ki/ic50) at h5-ht3a and
h5-ht1a receptors and rsert corresponding to rsert/h5ht3a/h5-ht1a ≈ 1:(15):(515). from a hypothesis that the
in vitro profile alone would reflect the relative in vivo occupancies, these ratios would correspond to in vivo occupancy levels of
4580% at 5-ht3 receptors and 2045% at 5-ht1a receptors
for a compound with an in vivo occupancy of 80% at sert
(figure 1). furthermore, the compounds were only considered
if the  xxxg1108xxx  affinity was <100 nm in order to limit
the amount of compounds for broader in vitro and in vivo
profiling.
we ﬁrst focused on the r1 substituent in the phenylsulfanyl
ring and the r5 substituent in the central benzene ring of lead
compound 4b (table 1). a number of analogues of 4b were
available at the onset of the project. in contrast to the methoxy in
4b, these analogues were furnished with either electron-withdrawing substituents (r1 = f or cf3) or substituents with limited
electronic eﬀects (r1 = cl, ch3, and tert-butyl). the series of
compounds was extended by synthesizing analogues carrying a
hydrogen atom at r5 instead of the methyl substituent of 4b.
these latter compounds demonstrated higher aﬃnities at the
 xxxg1116xxx  and 5-ht1a receptors in comparison with compounds

furnished with a methyl substituent at this position, i.e., 4ae
compared with 4fj. all compounds with relatively small
substituents at r1 and either a hydrogen atom or a methyl
substituent at r5 (4b,c,e,g,h,j,k) inhibited rsert in the same
range, whereas compounds with a ﬂuoro atom (4d and 4i) or a
hydrogen atom (4a and 4f) exhibited weaker rsert inhibition.
the compound 4l with the large tert-butyl substituent was a
signiﬁcant weaker inhibitor of rsert, demonstrating that small
r1 substituents are preferred for potent rsert inhibition. it was
also shown that rsert inhibition seemed to be less aﬀected by
the electronic eﬀects of the r1 substituent as long as the
substituent was above a certain size. the compounds with an
electron-donating methoxy substituent (4b and 4g), a more or
less neutral methyl or chloro substituent (4e, 4j, 4c, and 4h), or
an electron-withdrawing triﬂuoromethyl substituent (4k) were
more or less equipotent rsert inhibitors. from this initial series,
compounds 4h and 4j were selected for further in vitro evaluation
(tables 3 and 4), whereas compounds 4ae,g,k,l were discarded
because of their relative low h5-ht1a receptor aﬃnities and
compounds 4f and 4i were discarded because of their low rsert
inhibition and suboptimal ratio between rsert inhibition and
h5-ht1a receptor aﬃnity.
we extended the series of compounds through the synthesis
of analogues carrying a hydrogen atom at r5 and methoxy,
chloro, and/or methyl groups at other positions of the phenylsulfanyl ring. thus, the eﬀects of moving the substituent from
r1 to either r2 or r3 and of having two substituents (two
identical or two diﬀerent substituents) in the phenylsulfanyl
ring were investigated (table 2). in general, all of these

compounds (5ap) turned out to have relative high aﬃnities
for h5-ht3a receptors (ki from 7.3 to 110 nm). these
compounds also showed moderate to high aﬃnities at the h5ht1a receptor (ki from 14 to 330 nm) and moderate to high
activity at rsert (ic50 from 4.3 to 330 nm). compounds with
a methoxy or a methyl substituent at r2 or r3 (5ad) were
weaker rsert inhibitors than the corresponding r1 analogues
(4g and 4j). compound 5d, with a monomethyl substituent at
r3, showed high aﬃnity for h5-ht1a receptors, and the
corresponding r1 and r2 analogues 4j and 5b showed weaker
aﬃnities for h5-ht1a receptors compared with 5d by factors of 3
and 7, respectively.
six compounds were synthesized with two identical adjacent
substituents, i.e., compounds with the same substituent at r1 and
r2 (5e,f,g) or at r2 and r3 (5h,i,j). these compounds were all
relatively potent rsert inhibitors with favorable ratios between
the three targets. however, only compounds 5g, 5i, and 5j were
selected for further in vitro investigations (tables 3 and 4). three
compounds with identical substituents at r1 and r3 were also
synthesized (5k,l,m), and all these compounds had the desired h5ht3a/rsert ratio. whereas compound 5k showed weak h5ht1a receptor aﬃnity, compounds 5l and 5m were selected for
further in vitro proﬁling (tables 3 and 4). finally, three analogues
with diﬀerent substituents at r1 and r3 were synthesized (5n,o,p).
only compound 5p was selected for further in vitro proﬁling
(tables 3 and 4), since compounds 5n and 5o showed low 5-ht1a

receptor aﬃnities, i.e., compound 5n in relation to inhibition of
sert and 5o with ki > 100 nm.
compounds 4h, 4j, 5g, 5i, 5j, 5l, 5m, and 5p were tested for
rnet and rdat inhibition. the ratios between rdat and
rsert and between rnet and rsert inhibition are shown in
table 3. the rnet/rsert ratios ranged from 7 to 150, whereas
the rdat/rsert ratios ranged from 1 to 170. compound 5m
exhibited the highest ratio (170) between rdat and rsert
inhibition. compound 5g showed the highest ratio (150)
between rnet and rsert inhibition, and a group of compounds
including 5m showed rsert selectivity with ratios ranging from
20 to 35. furthermore, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic
( xxxg643xxx ) properties of the compounds in the series were
optimized by monitoring their in vitro metabolic stability in rat
and human liver microsomes and by assessing the inhibitory
potential of the compounds toward recombinant (cdna-expressed) human cyp450 enzymes. as shown in table 4, the
compounds generally showed good stability in human liver
microsomes; i.e., the intrinsic clearances (clint) of all but one
(5i) were below that for the human liver blood ﬂow (lbf).
conversely, in rat liver microsomes the clint were all above the
rat lbf of 20 ml/min, indicating high clearance in vivo. this was
conﬁrmed in vivo for all compounds tested in the project, e.g., for
compounds 4h and 5m the hepatic clearances and oral bioavailabilities in rats were found to be 5.8 and 7.1 (l/h)/kg and 26%
and 16%, respectively. furthermore, inhibition of cyp1a2,

cyp2c9, and cyp3a4 was found to be in the high micromolar
range for all compounds, while inhibition toward cyp2d6
ranged from 0.4 mum for compound 4h to 9.8 mum for compound
5m. on the basis of the favorable in vitro and  xxxg643xxx  proﬁle,
compound 5m was selected for further sar exploration, as well
as for broader in vitro and in vivo proﬁling.
the sar of 5m was further explored by a “methyl walk”
around the entire molecular framework (table 5). in addition,
the piperazine ring was replaced with a homopiperazine (6f) and
the sulfur atom with an oxygen atom (6g). in comparison to 5m,
all of these compounds showed weaker rsert inhibition, and
only compound 6g had acceptable h5-ht1a receptor aﬃnity.
they also had relatively large variations in their aﬃnity for h5ht3a receptors, with ki ranging from 45 to 670 nm. compound
6c (r6 = ch3) and homopiperazine 6f showed some selectivity
for h5-ht3a receptors, whereas the oxygen analogue 6g, in
agreement with literature data, had some selectivity for h5-ht1a
receptors.25
further pharmacological and pharmacokinetic characterization of 5m. compound 5m displayed high binding affinity
for cloned homomeric h5-ht3a receptors [ki = 23 nm (in-house)
and ki = 3.7 nm (cerep)]. in agreement with this, 5m was shown
to be a potent functional antagonist (ic50 = 12 nm, tested against
10 mum 5-ht) when tested in an electrophysiological setup

using xenopus oocytes expressing cloned homomeric h5-ht3a
receptors (figure 2). conversely, at higher concentrations, 5m
showed agonistic properties (ec50 = 2100 nm), reaching a
maximal response of 64% relative to 5-ht (figure 3). the
agonistic response could be blocked by the  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonist ondansetron (data not shown). at r5-ht3a receptors,
no agonistic response was found over a large concentration range
(0.1100000 nm), but in agreement with the findings at
h5-ht3a receptors, 5m was found to be a potent antagonist at
r5-ht3a receptors (ic50= 0.18 nm) (figure 2). compound 5m
displayed high binding affinity for cloned h5-ht1a receptors in
two different assays (ki = 39 nm (in-house) and ki = 15 nm
(mds pharmaservice), whereas relative low affinity binding was
found at r5-ht1a receptors (ki = 230 nm). in a [35s]guanosine

figure 1. calculated relationships between the occupancy levels at
5-ht1a or 5-ht3 receptors relative to serotonin (5-ht) transporter
(sert) occupancy. the line with circles (b) shows the relationship
between the occupancies if the ratio between the sert and 5-ht1a or
5-ht3 is 1. the line with triangles (2) shows the relationship when the
ratio is 5, and the line with squares (9) shows the relationship when the
ratio is 15; i.e., a compound with occupancy of 80% at sert would give
occupancy of 45% at 5-ht1a receptors if the aﬃnity at 5-ht1a receptors is
5-fold lower than at sert, whereas only 20% occupancy would be obtained
if the 5-ht1a receptors aﬃnity is 15-fold lower than at sert. the two

maximal response of 64% compared with the maximal response with
5-ht. note that after only one application of 5m for 30 s, the
subsequent application of either 5m or 5-ht (10 mum) did not induce
any response at all, indicating that 5m induces functional antagonism.
that means that it is only possible to test one concentration of 5m on

obtained from a test of each single concentration of 5m using three to six
separate oocytes.

treatment with 5m (5 or 10 (mg/kg)/day) also resulted in
significantly higher basal levels of 5-ht in the medial
prefrontal cortex (mpfc) compared to animals treated with
vehicle. the occupancy of sert by 5m after 3 days of
treatment with 5 or 10 (mg/kg)/day was 43% and 57%,
respectively (figure 6). furthermore, 5m showed a robust
antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like profile in multiple preclinical assays, such as the mouse forced-swim and tail-suspension
tests and the rat social interaction and conditioned-fear
paradigms.40
the prediction of the hepatic clearance of 5m in humans
was done by in vitro/in vivo extrapolation from the predicted

(ki = 46 nm) and serotonergic h5-ht1b (ki = 33 nm) and h5ht7 (ki = 19 nm) receptors (table 6). at h5-ht1b
receptors, 5m proved to be a partial agonist (ec50 = 120 nm,
efficacy = 55%) when tested in a [35s]gtpgammas binding assay,
whereas 5m was shown to be an antagonist (ki = 450 nm) at h5ht7 receptors when tested in a camp dependent fluorescence based assay using cloned h5-ht7 receptors expressed in
hek-cng cells. the unique in vitro pharmacological properties
of 5m (table 7) translate into an in vivo profile that differs
from those of currently used antidepressants. compound 5m

’ discussion and conclusion
a novel series of compounds with combined eﬀects on h5ht3a and h5-ht1a receptors and on the rsert was discovered.
compound 5m was identiﬁed as the lead compound from this
series, displaying the desired relative aﬃnities/potencies (ki/
ic50) between  xxxg1116xxx , 5-ht1a, and sert, as well as appropriate pharmacokinetic properties for further development.
compound 5m met the criteria set for eﬃcacy at these targets,
displaying antagonistic properties at h5-ht3a receptors, agonistic properties at h5-ht1a receptors, and inhibition of  xxxg2150xxx .
whereas 5m showed comparable potencies at both rat and
human sert, species diﬀerences were found at 5-ht1a and
 xxxg1116xxx  receptors. hence, rat models should be used with

caution when predicting the clinical potential of 5m. additional
proﬁling revealed that compound 5m exerted high aﬃnity (ki <
100 nm) at noradrenergic  xxxg1260xxx  (ki = 46 nm), serotonergic
h5-ht1b (ki = 33 nm), and h5-ht7 (ki = 19 nm) receptors.
in vitro functional characterization at these receptors showed
that 5m was a partial agonist at h5-ht1b receptors and an
antagonist at h5-ht7 receptors. taken together, compound 5m
exerts a multimodal serotonergic action, by inhibiting sert and
interacting with h5-ht1a, h5-ht1b, h5-ht3, and h5-ht7
receptors. indeed, the action of an eﬃcacious  xxxg1108xxx 
agonist is expected to rapidly desensitize the somatodendritic
5-ht1a autoreceptor41 and simultaneously activate postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors.42,17,18 moreover, the  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonistic eﬀect of 5m may counteract the inhibitory tonus of
the  xxxg1116xxx  on the noradrenergic and cholinergic systems, leading to a facilitating eﬀect on these systems,19,20 both of
which are known to be important in the pathology of
mood disorders.43,44 additionally, we have shown that the
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonist ondansetron potentiates citalopram-induced increases in 5-ht levels in the rat brain,45
3215

dx.doi.org/10.1021/jm101459g |j. med. chem. 2011, 54, 3206–3221

journal of medicinal chemistry
demonstrating that  xxxg1116xxx  blockade also facilitates
5-ht release. while the aﬃnity of 5m for the noradrenergic
 xxxg1260xxx  receptor did not translate to an obvious pharmacology
in vivo, the h5-ht1b and h5-ht7 receptor aﬃnity may contribute to the in vivo pharmacological proﬁle. the 5-ht1b
receptors are present on 5-ht nerve terminals, and a number
of studies have shown that stimulating 5-ht1b receptors leads to
a decrease in 5-ht output. conversely, the combination of
sert blockade and  xxxg1109xxx  antagonism has been
shown to augment 5-ht levels in microdialysis studies.46 we
have demonstrated that 5m exerts a partial agonistic proﬁle at the
h5-ht1b receptors, which could translate to an inhibitory
control of 5-ht1b receptors in vivo, thus further substantiating
the potential of 5m in a clinical setting. similarly,  xxxg1120xxx 
receptor blockade has been shown to be eﬃcacious in animal
models of depression, e.g., the mouse forced-swim test and tailsuspension test.47 the combination of an ssri with  xxxg1120xxx 
receptor blockade synergistically augments the levels of 5-ht in
the prefrontal cortex,48 suggesting that  xxxg1120xxx  receptor antagonism alone or in combination with sert blockade has antidepressant potential.
in this study we demonstrate that 5m aﬀects 5-ht levels in
both the ventral hippocampus and mpfc, two important brain
regions involved in regulation of mood.49,50 after acute administration in rat microdialysis experiments, compound 5m induced
a robust increase in extracellular 5-ht levels in the ventral
hippocampus. this increase is higher than those obtained after
acute administration of ssris51 and snris52,53 at doses that
maximally block sert,52 suggesting that the combined pharmacological eﬀects of 5m in rats on sert and 5-ht1b, 5-ht3, and
 xxxg1120xxx  receptors lead to an augmentation of the extracellular
5-ht levels when compared to that of ssris or snris. as
mentioned above, activation by  xxxg1108xxx  agonists leads
to rapid desensitization of somatodendritic 5-ht1a receptors,41
suggesting an additional beneﬁcial eﬀect in humans, which might
be diﬃcult to model in rats because the r5-ht1a receptor aﬃnity
is low. thus, the eﬀects of 5m on the 5-ht receptors may cancel
out inhibitory feedback eﬀects exerted on acute sert
inhibition.54 in the rat microdialysis experiments, 3 days of
treatment with 5m resulted in signiﬁcant increases in extracellular 5-ht levels at low sert occupancy, again suggesting a
multimodal mode of action of 5m. this is in contrast to
treatment with ssris, where chronic treatment is generally
required to overcome the inhibitory feedback mechanisms and
to produce a positive 5-ht response in preclinical models.55 in
conclusion, these characteristics indicate that 5m is a novel
multimodal serotonergic compound that has the potential to
beneﬁt symptomatologies associated with mood disorders. compound 5m ( xxxd3530xxx ) is currently in clinical development for
mdd.

aryl bromide/iodide (1.0 equiv, if this was a solid) were added to
pd2dba3 (2.5 mol %) and dpephos (10 mol %). subsequent toluene
(the amount required to make a ∼10% w/w solution of the aryl
bromide/iodide), the aryl bromide/iodide (1.0 equiv, if this was a
liquid), and the thiophenol (1.0 equiv) were added. the flask was
immersed in an oil bath preheated to 100 °c. the mixture was stirred at
this temperature until the reaction was complete (typically <2 h for aryl
iodides and overnight for aryl bromides). the crude mixture was loaded
onto a silica gel column and eluted with heptane/ethyl acetate to give the
products in >95% purity as determined by 1h nmr.

in vitro pharmacology. the assays used for the sar studies are
described below. details and all other pharmacology are described in
supporting information. in general for binding affinity assays, data
points were expressed as percent of the specific binding, and the ic50
values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis using a
sigmoidal variable slope curve fitting. the dissociation constant (ki)
was calculated from the chengprusoff equation (ki = ic50/(1 þ ([l]/
kd)), where the concentration of free radioligand l is approximated to
the concentration of added radioligand in the assay, and kd equals the
affinity of the radioligand to the receptor. in general ic50 values are
based on 68 different concentrations covering 46 decades.
h5-ht3a binding affinity assay. [3h]granisetron (1 nm)
(perkin-elmer) binding to h5-ht3a receptors was evaluated in membranes from a hek-293 cell line stably expressing the hht3a receptor.
nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 10 mum bemesetron. after incubation, the membrane preparations were rapidly filtered
under a vacuum using glass-fiber filters. compounds were tested at least
three times over a 6 log concentration range. ic50 values were
determined by nonlinear regression analysis using hill equation curve
fitting, and ki values were calculated based on the chengprusoff
equation.
h5-ht1a binding affinity assay. [3h]5-carboxamidotryptamine (0.15 nm) (perkin-elmer) binding to cloned human 5-ht1a
receptors in cho cells or hela was assayed in a membrane-based
scintillation proximity assay. the level of nonspecific binding was
obtained in the presence of 10 mum 5-ht or metergoline. compounds
were tested at least three times over a 6 log concentration range. ic50
values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis using hill
equation curve fitting, and ki values were calculated based on the
chengprusoff equation.
inhibition of [3h]ne, [3h]da, and [3h]5-ht uptake by rat
synaptosomes. net, dat, and sert transporter inhibition (ic50)

in rat synaptosomes was measured using [3h]ne, [3h]da, and [3h]5ht, respectively. after incubation, the membrane preparations were
rapidly filtered under a vacuum using glass-fiber filters. the filters were
washed with ice-cold buffer using a harvester. bound radioactivity was
measured by scintillation counting using a scintillation cocktail. compounds were tested at least twice over a 6 log concentration range. ic50
values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis using hill
equation curve fitting.
cytochrome p450 enzyme inhibition. cyp enzyme inhibition
was performed using recombinant enzymes (supersome, gentest),
expressing individual cyp enzymes (cyp1a2, cyp2c9, cyp2d6
and cyp3a4). the inhibition of cyp enzymes by the test compounds
was assessed by incubating each enzyme with its substrate (7-ethoxy-3cyanocoumarin was used for cyp1a2 (10 mum); dibenzylfuorescein (2
mum) was used for cyp2c9; resorufin benzyl ether (100 mum) was used
for cyp3a4; and 3-[2-(n,n-diethyl-n-methylamino)ethyl]-7-methoxy4-methylcoumarin (3 mum) was used for cyp2d6) alone or in the
presence of the test compounds at eight different concentrations
(400.02 mum). all incubations (28 min for cyp1a2, 30 min for
cyp3a4, and 45 min for cyp2c9 and cyp2d6) were performed in
phosphate buffer with an nadph regenerating system containing
nadpþ,  xxxd1292xxx  dehydrogenase,  xxxd1292xxx ,
sodium citrate and mgcl2. at the end of the incubation period, the
amount of metabolite formed was measured using a fluorescence
spectrophotometer. the excitation and emission wavelengths in
nanometers are 405 (ex) and 465 (em) for cyp1a2 and cyp2d6,
485 (ex) and 535 (em) for cyp2c9, and 530 (ex) and 590 (em) for
cyp3a4. inhibitions were expressed relative to controls (without
inhibitors), and ic50 values were calculated using microsoft excel
software.
microsomal stability determination. the microsomal intrinsic clearance was determined by assessing the elimination of test

compound over the incubation time. the test compounds were incubated at 1 mum with human and rat microsomes (bd biosciences) for
60 min, using nadph as cofactor. an nadph regenerating system
containing nadpþ,  xxxd1292xxx  dehydrogenase, glucose
6-phosphate, sodium citrate, and mgcl2 (cofactor mix) was used as a
source of nadph. human and rat microsomes were thawed at room
temperature, and cofactor mix was added. the mixture was stirred on a
vortex and put in a water bath at 37 °c for 10 min. the reaction was
initiated by adding test compound (final concentration 1 mum, 0.5 mg of
protein/ml). separate incubations were made for each test compound
and time point. the samples were incubated for 0, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min,
and the reactions were stopped by adding 100 mul of acetonitrile and
transferred to a 96-well stop plate with seals. the stop plates were
centrifuged for 10 min at 3300 rpm and 4 °c before being analyzed by
liquid chromatography coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer
(lcms/ms, waters quattromicro, manchester, u.k.).

plasma binding by equilibrium dialysis measurements.
the method was a modification of that reported by kalvass et al.58
briefly, a 96-well equilibrium dialysis apparatus was used to determine
the free fraction in the plasma (ht dialysis llc, gales ferry, ct, u.s.).
membranes (3 kda cutoff) were conditioned in deionized water for 40
min, followed by conditioning in 80:20 deionized water/ethanol for 20
min, and then rinsed in deionized water before use. plasma was diluted
1:1 with pbs. diluted plasma was spiked with the 1 mum test compound
and loaded into the 96-well equilibrium dialysis plate. dialysis versus
pbs (100 ul) was carried out for 5 h in a temperature controlled
incubator at 37 °c, before being analyzed by liquid chromatography
coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer (lcms/ms, waters quattromicro, manchester, u.k.).
in vivo pharmacokinetics in rats. in vivo pharmacokinetics was
studied in rats following single intravenous (1 mg/kg) or oral (2 mg/kg)
administration of compounds. serial blood samples were collected at
various time points up to 6 h after dosing. in vivo pharmacokinetic
parameters were obtained following compartmental modeling. bioanalysis of samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to a
tandem mass spectrometer (lcms/ms, waters quattromicro, manchester, u.k.).
microdialysis in rats. rats (300350 g; harlan, horst, the
netherlands) were used for the experiments. for acute administration
5m was dissolved in 10% hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin and administered subcutaneously (sc) in a volume of 1 ml/kg. for 3-day treatment
with 5m minipumps were used to deliver the solutions. under isoflurane
anesthesia osmotic minipumps (2ml2, alzet, u.s.) were implanted in a
subcutaneous pocket created on the right side parallel to the spine of the
animal. by stereotaxic surgery i-shaped microdialysis probes (hospal
an 69 membrane, 4 mm exposed surface; brainlink) were inserted into
the ventral hippocampus or medial prefrontal cortex under isoflurane
anesthesia. microdialysis experiments were performed 2448 h after
surgery by perfusing the probes with artificial csf (147 mm nacl,
3.0 mm kcl, 1.2 mm cacl2, and 1.2 mm mgcl2) at a flow rate of 1.5
mul/min. microdialysis samples were collected at 20 or 30 min intervals
into minivials. after the experiment the rats were sacrificed and the
position of each probe was histologically verified by making coronal
sections of the brain.
serotonin analysis. aliquots were injected onto a hplc column.
chromatographic separation was performed using an isocratic mobile
phase. mobile phase was run through the system at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/
min, and 5-ht was detected electrochemically at þ500 mv. for acute
experiments four consecutive pretreatment samples were taken as
baseline and their mean concentration was set to 100%. drug effects
were expressed as percentages of basal level (mean ( sem) within the
same animal. moreover, differences between basal outputs of 5-ht
(fmol/30 min sample) after treatment with 5m or vehicle for 3 days were
compared.

sert occupancy in rats. after the microdialysis experiments rats
were sacrificed and the brains were removed and stored at 80 °c until
cutting. sections of 20 mum containing the striatum were cut and air-dried
before the binding experiment. for sert occupancy 0.5 nm [3h]dasb
was used as radioligand. the control for nonspecific binding was 1 mum
escitalopram. the binding buffer consisted of 50 mm tris, 150 mm
nacl, and 5 mm kcl, ph 7.4, and the incubation time was 90 min. slides
were washed in the respective buffers at 4 °c three times for 5 min, then
briefly dipped in distilled water and air-dried. the slides were analyzed in
a biospace beta-imager 2000 for at least 6 h.
