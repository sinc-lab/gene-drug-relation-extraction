abstract
background: bcr-abl kinase domain mutations are infrequently detected in newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic
myeloid leukemia (cml) patients. recent studies indicate the presence of pre-existing bcr-abl mutations in a higher
percentage of cml patients when cd34+ stem/progenitor cells are investigated using sensitive techniques, and these
mutations are associated with imatinib resistance and disease progression. however, such studies were limited to smaller
number of patients.
methods: we investigated bcr-abl kinase domain mutations in cd34+ cells from 100 chronic-phase cml patients by
multiplex allele-specific pcr and sequencing at diagnosis. mutations were re-investigated upon manifestation of imatinib
resistance using allele-specific pcr and direct sequencing of bcr-abl kinase domain.
results: pre-existing bcr-abl mutations were detected in 32/100 patients and included f311l, m351t, and t315i. after a
median follow-up of 30 months (range 8–48), all patients with pre-existing bcr-abl mutations exhibited imatinib resistance.
of the 68 patients without pre-existing bcr-abl mutations, 24 developed imatinib resistance; allele-specific pcr and bcrabl kinase domain sequencing detected mutations in 22 of these patients. all 32 patients with pre-existing bcr-abl
mutations had the same mutations after manifestation of imatinib-resistance. in imatinib-resistant patients without preexisting bcr-abl mutations, we detected f311l, m351t, y253f, and t315i mutations. all imatinib-resistant patients except
t315i and y253f mutations responded to imatinib dose escalation.
conclusion: pre-existing bcr-abl mutations can be detected in a substantial number of chronic-phase cml patients by
sensitive allele-specific pcr technique using cd34+ cells. these mutations are associated with imatinib resistance if affecting
drug binding directly or indirectly. after the recent approval of  xxxd2724xxx ,  xxxd1815xxx ,  xxxd359xxx  and  xxxd2985xxx  for treatment of
chronic myeloid leukemia along with imatinib, all of which vary in their effectiveness against mutated bcr-abl forms,
detection of pre-existing bcr-abl mutations can help in selection of appropriate first-line drug therapy. thus, mutation
testing using cd34+ cells may facilitate improved, patient-tailored treatment.

introduction

design and methods

chronic myeloid leukemia (cml) is a hematopoietic stem cell
disorder characterized by the t (9; 22) chromosomal translocation.
this translocation results in the formation of bcr-abl fusion
gene, which is central to the pathogenesis of cml. the bcr-abl
gene exhibits constitutive  xxxg2198xxx  activity, resulting in
myeloid proliferation [1].  xxxd2333xxx , a  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitor (tki), induces durable responses in the majority of cml
patients and is currently the standard of care for cml [2,3].
however, imatinib resistance, usually due to bcr-abl kinase
domain (kd) point mutations, remains a significant problem in
the management of cml patients [4,6]. bcr-abl mutations
have varying effects on the patient’s sensitivity to imatinib and
other tkis, and may cause partial or complete resistance
depending upon the nature and location of the mutations [5,7–
10]. the presence of kd mutations has been studied mostly in the
advanced phase of cml (accelerated phase and blast crisis), in
chronic phase (cp) patients who develop resistance to imatinib,
and in philadelphia-positive (ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia
[5,10–13].
bcr-abl kd mutations can exist in the newly diagnosed cpcml patients and may affect the outcome of imatinib treatment
[14–18]. there are limited data available from imatinib-naive
patients in cp-cml regarding the incidence of kd mutations,
and the correlation of these mutations with the therapeutic
response in unselected patients has not been established [14,17–
18]. although kd mutations are infrequently detected in newly
diagnosed cp-cml patients [18], kd mutations were found in a
substantial number of patients when cd34+ stem cell were
analyzed [19,20]. previous studies indicated that a small population of cd34+ cml (stem/progenitor) cells are less responsive to
imatinib and other tkis, and act as a reservoir for the emergence
of imatinib-resistant subclones [19,21–23]. thus, the detection of
pre-existing mutations (pems) in primitive stem/progenitor
(cd34+) cells may have therapeutic and prognostic implications
and is likely to be helpful in optimizing the management of cml
patients, specifically after availability of three  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitors as first-line treatment of cml which vary in their
effectiveness against different bcr-abl mutants as well as after
fda approval of  xxxd2985xxx  for tki-resistant cml, particularly
the most aggressive t315i-mutant cml [19–23]. large-scale
studies to assess the role of bcr-abl pems in cd34+ cells and
their correlation with imatinib therapy in cp-cml are lacking.
to address this issue, we analyzed 100 newly diagnosed cp-cml
patients for bcr-abl pems in cd34+ cml cells using allelespecific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (aso-pcr)
and sequencing, and studied the outcome of these patients after
imatinib treatment.

patients’ samples were collected from the following centers. 1)
department of oncology, allied hospital and punjab medical
college faisalabad, pakistan. 2) pakistan institute of medical
sciences hospital, islamabad, pakistan. 3) khyber teaching
hospital & hayatabad medical complex, pgmi peshawar,
pakistan. 4) institute of radiotherapy and nuclear medicine,
peshawar, pakistan, & 5) hopes, department of zoology,
university of the punjab, lahore, pakistan. all patients gave
written informed consent, and the institutional ethics committees
of the participating centers approved the study as well as contents
of the written consent.

patients and definitions
one hundred newly diagnosed cp-cml patients were included
in the study. the study was conducted from march 2006 until
february 2010 and 4 centers participated in the study while
experiments were carried out at hopes, department of zoology,
university of the punjab, lahore, pakistan. all patients had newly
diagnosed cp-cml at the time of sample collection, and patients
with accelerated-phase or blast-crisis cml were excluded.
patients’ clinical characteristics are given in table 1.
cp was defined by the presence of less than 15% blasts, less
than 20% basophils, and less than 30% blasts and promyelocytes
in the peripheral blood and bone marrow (bm) and no
extramedullary blastic disease [24]. complete hematologic
response (chr), complete cytogenetic response (ccyr), and a
partial cytogenetic response were defined according to previously
published response criteria [24]. briefly, chr required the
normalization of blood counts; leucocytes counts ,10,000/mm3;
normal differential counts without blasts, promyelocytes, or
myelocytes; platelet counts from 150,000/mm3 to 450,000/mm3;
and no evidence of extramedullary disease. ccyr was defined as
0% ph+ cells in metaphase bm samples, and a major (partial)
cytogenetic response (pcyr) was defined as the presence of 1–
35% ph+ cells in bm. other categories included minor cytogenetic
response (36–65% ph+ cells in bm) and minimal cytogenetic
response (66–95% ph+ cells in bm). molecular response was
defined as bcr-abl fusion transcript negativity according to
nested reverse-transcriptase pcr. we could not record the major
molecular response (mmr) due to the non-availability of real-time
quantitative pcr during the study, but a real-time quantitative
pcr was performed on archived samples preserved in 10%
dmso and 90% fbs stored at 280uc using ipsogen bcrabl mbcr fusionquanth kit (catalogue fqpp-10-ce) at the
end of the study after the availability of real-time pcr (ab1 7500
real-time pcr, applied biosystems, usa). a 3-log reduction in
bcr-abl transcripts was considered an mmr.
resistance patterns were adopted as defined by the leukemianet guidelines [24]. primary or intrinsic resistance was defined by
the failure to achieve chr by 3 months, any cytogenetic response

been optimized and clinically validated using appropriate positive
and negative controls elsewhere [31]. this assay can detect 18 of
the most clinically relevant and common bcr-abl mutations
[14,29–30]. pcr amplifications were performed exactly as
reported, without changing any of the reagents, pcr mix
formulations and thermal profile [29]. the sequences of aso
primers specific for each mutation with the corresponding
annealing temperatures are given in table 2. hl60 cell line
(atcc # ccl-240tm) was used as a negative control in asopcr reactions. although we used pre-validated aso-pcr assays
and reproduced those assays using exactly same reaction
conditions, reagents and pcr mix formulation, to eliminate the
possibility of false-positive results aso-pcr products were
sequenced on both strands using an automated abi377 sequencer
(applied biosystems). sequences were analyzed with sequence
analysis software v3.3 and sequence navigator software v1.0.1
(applied biosystems). a mutation was considered present only if it
was detected in both strands in two or more independent asopcr amplified products [14,29–31].

complete cytogenetic response by 18 months. acquired or
secondary resistance was defined as the loss of previous
hematological, cytogenetic, or molecular responses, sustained
chr that was followed by transformation to the accelerated or
blastic phase, ph+ clonal evolution, or the emergence of clinically
relevant bcr-abl kd mutations predicted to confer resistance
[25].

isolation of cd34+ cml stem/progenitor cells
bm mononuclear cells were isolated by  xxxd3253xxx -hypaque (sigma
diagnostics, st louis, mo) density gradient separation (specific
gravity, 1.077) for 30 min at 4006g. the cells were then
suspended in a solution of 10% dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) in
fetal calf serum (fcs) and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen until
required [26]. before use, cells were thawed and stained with
antibodies to cd34 directly conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (becton dickinson immunocytometry system, san jose,
ca). after staining for 30 min at 4uc, the cells were washed twice
in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fcs (stem cell
technologies inc.) and resuspended in 2 mg/ml  xxxd3027xxx  iodide
(sigma). cd34+ cells were collected by fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (facs) using a facsvantage cell sorter (becton
dickinson, san jose, ca) [27].

imatinib treatment and response monitoring
all patients were treated with 400 mg of imatinib/day. clinical
studies were performed in collaboration with cml treatment
centers. patients were monitored every 2 weeks for hematological
response and every 3 months for cytogenetic and molecular
response during imatinib treatment and follow-up. secondary
resistance, as described previously, was also monitored. for
imatinib-resistant patients, second-generation tkis were not
available due to financial constraints. however, imatinib-resistant
patients were treated with 600–800 mg of imatinib/day, irrespective of presence or absence of pems [7]. patients were monitored
regularly every 2 weeks for hematological response and every 12
weeks for cytogenetic and molecular responses after imatinib dose
escalation.

detection of pre-existing bcr-abl mutations
rna and dna were extracted from facs-sorted cd34+ cells
using trizol and dnazol (invitrogen life technologies, carlsbad, ca) methods, respectively [28]. rna and dna quality was
checked by spectrophotometry, gel electrophoresis, and by the
amplification of the abl gene [14,18]. as bcr-abl pems are
known to be rare among wild-type bcr-abl and thus cannot be
detected by sequencing the whole bcr-abl kd, we employed a
very sensitive aso-pcr assay for this purpose which has already

detection of mutations after the manifestation of
imatinib resistance

statistical analysis
various clinical parameters, frequencies of imatinib resistance,
and clinical response rates were compared in the two subgroups of
patients with and without pems by chi-square test using
‘‘statistical package for social sciences (spss)’’ software, version
17. a p-value of ,0.05 was considered significant.

all imatinib-resistant patients, irrespective of their pem status,
were investigated for bcr-abl mutations using aso-pcr
[14,29–30], as well as by dna sequencing of the rt-pcr–
amplified whole bcr-abl kd. for rt-pcr and dna
sequencing of the bcr-abl kd, we adopted the protocol
described by branford and hughes [31] using an automated
abi377 sequencer (applied biosystems). hl60 cell line (atcc #
ccl-240tm) was used as a negative control in pcr and
sequencing while kcl22 cell line (dsmz # acc 519) was used
as a positive control. sequences were analyzed with sequence
analysis software v3.3 and sequence navigator software v1.0.1
(applied biosystems). to confirm mutation detection by sequencing, the opposite strand of the pcr product was sequenced.
moreover, the whole procedure of rna extraction, rt-pcr, and
sequencing was repeated once. detection of the mutation was
confirmed only if the same mutation was detected in both dna
strands as well as in the repeat analysis [15,29,31].

results
pre-existing and post-resistance bcr-abl mutations
bcr-abl pems were detected in 32 out of 100 (32%) patients
(table 3). we found three mutations, namely t315i, f311l, and
m351t, either alone or in combination, as pems in this group of
cml patients. the frequencies of the m351t, f311l, and t315i
mutations were 87.5%, 50%, and 37.5%, respectively, either alone
or in combination. thus, m351t was the most common pem,
whereas t315i was the least common pem detected (figure 2).
after a median follow-up of 30 months (range 8–48), patients with
bcr-abl pems exhibited imatinib resistance (32/32, 100%).
upon re-investigation of bcr-abl mutations in these patients
using aso-pcr and dna sequencing, all patients had the same
pems (figure 1 and 2). regarding the 68 patients without pems,

sensitive to tkis and is usually responsible for the development of
resistance to therapy [21,22]. the bcr-abl fusion gene is highly
unstable in these primitive cml cells, and it is associated with
frequent genetic alterations and mutations in bcr-abl itself as
well as in other genes such as p53 even in the absence of imatinib
exposure [30]. these naturally occurring genetic variants of bcrabl are known as pre-existing bcr-abl mutations (pems) [7].
although the mechanism of clinical resistance to imatinib in cml
varies widely, bcr-abl kd point mutations are the leading
cause of imatinib resistance [1,11]. if these mutations are present
in critical regions of bcr-abl, they can affect the binding of
bcr-abl protein with tkis. the impaired binding of imatinib
to these bcr-abl mutants results in an inadequate response or
loss of response. the mutant strains proliferate under selective
pressure of tkis after treatment initiation, leading to drug
resistance [4,11]. these mutations are likely to be present at an
early stage of disease evolution and become clinically manifested
due to selective overgrowth after imatinib treatment [20,23].
our study demonstrated that bcr-abl pems might be found
in a substantial number of newly diagnosed cp-cml patients if
sensitive techniques such as aso-pcr are used to assess cd34+
stem/progenitor cells, and these pems can significantly affect the
outcome of imatinib therapy. bcr-abl pems have been
reported previously in newly diagnosed cp-cml patients in
some studies [14–15,17,20,31], whereas others failed to detect any
mutations in cp-cml patients before treatment initiation despite
using sensitive techniques [18]. most of these studies were limited
by a small sample size and cd34+ cell population was not
specifically targeted for mutation detection. ours is the largest
study to date on the incidence of naturally occurring bcr-abl
kd mutations using cd34+ cells and their association with
imatinib resistance. although more than 50 bcr-abl mutations
have been reported, we analyzed for the 18 most common
mutations as: 1) they cover more than 90% of the mutations
responsible for imatinib resistance and not all the mutations are
clinically relevant [18,20], 2) these 18 mutations can be detected
by aso-pcr which is the most sensitive technique to detect low
copy number mutations like pre-existing bcr-abl mutations.
furthermore, detection of pems using aso-pcr in a group of
cml patients and detection of the same mutations after a period
of time after manifestation of imatinib resistance in that group
using aso-pcr as well as sequencing, is an indirect proof of
validity of aso-pcr for pem detection with a minimal possibility
of false positive results, which was done in our study.

imatinib resistance developed in 24 (24/68, 35.3%) patients. bcrabl mutations (alone or in combination) were found in 22 of these
patients (table 3; figure 2). by dna sequencing, we were able to
detect y253f mutation in one of the patients as an acquired
mutation (not as a pem). t315i (12/22, 54.5%) and f311l (15/
22, 68.2%) were the most common mutations in this group of
patients, whereas m351t was detected in 9/21 (42.8%) patients.

association of mutations with clinical parameters
no significant association was found between bcr-abl kd
pems and clinical parameters such as age, gender, type of bcrabl splice variant, white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, and
platelet count (data not shown). imatinib-resistant cml patients
with and without pems significantly differed with respect to
frequency of imatinib resistance (100% vs. 35.3%, p = 0.01), chr
(71.9% vs. 91.2%, p = 0.05), partial hematological response
(28.1% vs. 4.4%, p = 0.01), minor cytogenetic response (15.6%
vs. 8.8%, p = 0.05), and cmr (0% vs. 41.2%, p = 0.001), while no
significant difference was found in terms of ccyr (53.1% vs.
55.9%), time to development of resistance (16.5 vs. 18.2 months),
and time to progression of disease (27.6 vs. 32.3 months) in the two
groups. all ccrs correlated with mmrs on archived samples.

management of resistant patients
resistant patients were treated with 600–800 mg of imatinib/
day irrespective of pem status. patients harboring the t315i
mutation (alone or in combination with f311l/m351t) did not
exhibit any response, and progressed to accelerated-phase or blastcrises (12/32, 37.5%). in this group of patients with f311l/
m351t pems (20/32, 62.5%), 16 patients (16/20, 80%) exhibited
complete hematological, cytogenetic, and molecular responses to
dose escalation, whereas four patients had partial cytogenetic
responses (4/20, 20%). fifteen cml patients without pems
harboring a t315i mutation (alone or in combination with
f311l/m351t/y253f) did not respond to imatinib dose
escalation and progressed to an advanced phase, whereas 7 out
of 9 (77.8%) patients harboring f311l/m351t mutations
responded to dose escalation with complete hematological,
cytogenetic, and molecular responses.

cp-cml comprises of two types of cells. the majority of cells of
the leukemic clone comprise a more mature type that is sensitive to
tkis. a small population of stem/progenitor (cd34+) cells is less

natural bcr-abl mutants in newly diagnosed cp-cml

the reasons for the presence of pems in almost one-third of our
cp-cml patients are not entirely clear. we selected cd34+ cells
to detect kd mutations because this compartment of primitive
cells is likely to be the source of many of these mutations [14] and
this, in combination with the use of a sensitive technique such as
aso-pcr in a larger number of patients, may explain our
findings [19]. furthermore, it is also known that patients with
advanced cp-cml are more likely to exhibit various kd
mutations and primary resistance [5,33]. many patients in our
area present late due to poor knowledge, lack of education, and
the use of traditional remedies before seeking medical advice.
therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that our patient
population may be skewed toward a higher-risk group of cp-cml
patients [19]. this could explain the higher mutation detection
rate in some of these patients.
to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies of kd
mutation detection in cml patients comparing whole mononuclear cells (mnc) with cd34+ cells, so we can only hypothesize
that by selecting cd34+ cells, the likelihood of detection of low
level mutations is increased. our findings are also supported by the
work performed by chu et al, who reported that kd mutations,
when studied in cd34+ cells, were present even during complete
cytogenetic remission in 5 of 13 cml patients treated with
imatinib [19]. recent studies indicate that residual  xxxg23xxx +
progenitors persist despite undetectable molecular disease in cml
patients responsive to imatinib [32]. furthermore, jiang et al
recently showed that kd mutations were present even in very
primitive (cd34+cd382) stem cells [20]. overall, these data
suggest that cd34+ progenitor/stem cell compartment usually
harbors kd mutations in cp-cml, and these low level mutations
are more likely to be detected in cd34+ cell population, as
compared to mnc. these findings also support the idea that
primitive cml cells have an intrinsic tendency to continuously
acquire new mutations independent of therapy. some of the
mutations would be expected to confer imatinib resistance; others
could lead to disease progression. it is the nature and timing of
these mutations at diagnosis and during imatinib treatment that
may explain the variable clinical responses in different patients
[6,15–16,20,33–34]. thus, the cml patients labeled clinically as
imatinib responders and non-responders display significant differences in the frequencies of mutant bcr-abl transcripts present in
their pretreatment cd34+ cells [20,35].
different bcr-abl mutations have prognostic significance and
vary in their effects on the sensitivity to standard doses and dose
escalations of imatinib and as well as to other tkis [3,6–7,13,36–
39]. all of our resistant patients were treated with imatinib dose
escalation to 600–800 mg daily irrespective of their pem status.
we did not have an opportunity to treat imatinib-resistant patients
with second-line tkis because these agents were not obtainable
due to the high cost and lack of funding (only imatinib was
supplied free of cost to these patients by a non-governmental
organization). twelve patients with t315i pem (alone or in
combination with f311l and/or m351t) did not respond to
imatinib dose escalation, and they progressed to accelerated-phase
or blast-crisis. in the group of patients with pem, 16 of 20 patients
with f311l and/or m351t mutations exhibited complete
hematological, cytogenetic, and molecular responses to dose
escalation, whereas the other four patients exhibited partial
cytogenetic responses. fifteen cml patients without pems
harboring t315i mutation (alone or in combination with f311l,
m351t, and/or t253l mutations) did not respond to imatinib
dose escalation, as expected, and progressed; whereas 7 out of 9
patients harboring f311l and/or m351t mutations responded to
dose escalation, achieving complete hematological and cytogenetic
plos one | www.plosone.org

responses. overall, 31 cml patients remained resistant to
imatinib even after dose escalation.
we detected more than one mutation in some of the patients.
these mutations could be either in the same clone or two different
clones, and cannot be confirmed by direct aso-pcr or
sequencing techniques. in order to know if such multiple
mutations in the same patient are present in the same or different
clones, one need to sub-clone the pcr fragments, select at least 20
or more different clones and perform sequencing of each clone.
although it may be interesting to study the clone specificity and
the response to treatment in patients with ‘‘multiple mutations in
two or more different clones’’ and ‘‘multiple mutations in the same
clone’’, the clinical value of determining this clone specificity of
multiple mutations remains to be established.
currently, screening for bcr-abl mutations is not recommended in newly diagnosed cp-cml patients [24] because the
frequency of mutations in these patients was found to be low in
previous studies, these mutations may not necessarily correlate
with response, and the screening costs are prohibitive
[18,24,36,39–40]. according to the european leukemianet
guidelines for cml management, mutation analysis of cp-cml
patients treated with imatinib should be performed when there is
evidence of inadequate response or loss of response [24]. our
study revealed that using sensitive techniques and cd34+ cell
population, bcr-abl kd mutations may be found in a
substantial number of patients and correlate with response to
imatinib therapy and pre-treatment mutation detection may have
important clinical implications in the post-imatinib era. fda has
approved two second-line tkis– xxxd1815xxx  and  xxxd2724xxx –for the
frontline treatment of cml. bcr-abl mutations respond
differently to three  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors approved for firstline treatment of cml, e.g., y253f and g250e mutations
resistant to imatinib can respond to  xxxd2724xxx  or/and  xxxd1815xxx ,
t315a shows better response to imatinib though resistant to
 xxxd1815xxx  and  xxxd2724xxx , while some mutations are less sensitive to
 xxxd2724xxx  (e255k/v and f359v/c) or  xxxd1815xxx  (f317l and
v299l) [41]. in this scenario, knowledge about the presence and
type of mutations may facilitate timely decision making regarding
the choice of first-line therapy at the time of diagnosis. patients
with mutations known to confer resistance to standard or high
doses of imatinib can benefit from an upfront treatment with a
second-line tkis and vice versa. for patients with mutations such
as t315i which is known to confer resistance to all tkis currently
approved for first-line treatment of cml, one of the newer agents
such as  xxxd2985xxx  ( xxxd2985xxx ) which is effective against this
mutation [41] and very recently been approved by fda for
tki-resistant cml [42], or allogeneic transplantation must be
considered.
second-generation tkis induce cytogenetic responses in
around 50% of patients with cp-cml in whom imatinib
treatment has failed. although two of the second lines tkis have
been approved for first line therapy of cml, we still find the
applicability of this study for the future because of the cost issues.
imatinib patent is about to finish in the near future and with the
availability of generic forms of imatinib, the cost difference
between imatinib and 2nd line tkis is going to be substantial.
stratification of patients based on mutations before the start of
therapy may have significant cost savings.
we acknowledge the fact that there is high incidence of imatinib
resistance in our study patients. patients with cml vary in their
response to treatment and although the basis for this variation is
not known, it has been attributed to the biologic heterogeneity of
the disease. some of the factors implicated in poor response to
cml therapy include low level of expression of molecular

transporter hoct1 and multidrug resistance gene ( xxxg10xxx )
polymorphisms [43–44]. population based studies have shown
lower efficacy of imatinib in cml patients when compared to the
clinical trial results. lucas et el reported 49% imatinib failure by
24 months and suggested caution in extrapolating clinical trial
data to the general cml population [45]. possible causes of
inferior results in the community setting include less strict
conditions than in the clinical trials, lesser motivation and poorer
compliance with the treatment. marin et al recently showed that
lack of adherence to treatment was an important factor leading to
poor results in cml patients [46]. poor compliance, inclusion of
patients in the late chronic phase and genetic variability are the
possible explanations for high resistance in our study.
in summary, we found that by using sensitive techniques like
aso-pcr in cd34+ cells, bcr-abl kd mutations could be
detected in almost one-third of cp-cml patients at the time of
diagnosis and were found to be associated with the outcome of
imatinib therapy. therefore, testing for bcr-abl mutations in
cd34+ cml stem/progenitor cells using validated sensitive assays
like allele-specific pcr may be cost-effective and should be
considered before the start of tki therapy, particularly in patients
who present in the late cp. larger population-based studies with
longer follow-up times are needed to estimate the true incidence of
kd mutations in this group of patients and determine whether
screening is useful in management planning in present scenario of
