 xxxd2410xxx : a novel microtubule-stabilizing agent
for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer
susan goodin

mportant advances in the management of breast cancer include
the introduction of three main
classes of chemotherapeutic agentsâ€”
anthracyclines, taxanes, and fluorinated pyrimidines (e.g.,  xxxd425xxx )â€”that have improved
overall outcomes for patients with
metastatic disease.1-3 however, the
clinical utility of these therapies has
become limited in some patients by
the emergence of drug resistance.4-7
the increasing use of anthracyclines
and taxanes as adjuvant therapies
has highlighted the need for new, effective, first-line therapies for metastatic disease.3 it has also led to the
investigation of ways to overcome the
problem of drug resistance in order
to maximize the impact of chemotherapy on survival. the  xxxd2014xxx 
derivatives are one class of agents
resulting from this research.
the epothilones are microtubulestabilizing agents that have shown
promising activity in patients with
various cancers, including cancers resistant to taxanes and other cytotoxic
drugs.7-11 epothilones are naturally
occurring macrolide compounds
(i.e., containing a macrocyclic lactone
ring) that constitute a novel class of
cytotoxic drugs. naturally derived
epothilones have limitations such

purpose. the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety, dosage, and
administration of  xxxd2410xxx  in patients
with metastatic breast cancer are examined.
summary. the clinical utility of the three
main classes of chemotherapeutic agents
used in breast cancer (i.e., anthracyclines,
taxanes, and fluorinated pyrimidines) is
limited in some patients by the emergence
of drug resistance which leads to disease
progression. a recent addition to the available drugs for the treatment of advanced
breast cancer is the  xxxd2854xxx  analog
 xxxd2410xxx , which has demonstrated clinical activity in patients who have tumors
that have progressed while on other chemotherapy regimens, including anthracyclines and taxanes. in phase ii clinical trials
of  xxxd2410xxx  in patients with metastatic
breast cancer, clinically meaningful benefits have been achieved with  xxxd2410xxx 
monotherapy in patients in whom anthracyclines, taxanes, and  xxxd425xxx 
are no longer effective.  xxxd2410xxx  has
demonstrated activity in first-, second-, and
subsequent-lines of therapy and in different subtypes of patients with advanced
disease. in a phase iii trial in patients who

had previously received taxanes and anthracyclines, the combination of  xxxd2410xxx  and  xxxd425xxx  was significantly
more effective in producing an objective
response and in prolonging progressionfree survival than  xxxd425xxx  alone. at
the recommended dose and administration schedule,  xxxd2410xxx  is generally
well tolerated. the most clinically relevant
adverse events associated with its use have
been myelosuppression and peripheral
neuropathy, which is primarily sensory and
cumulative but reversible within six weeks
of a dosage reduction or the discontinuation of therapy.
conclusion.  xxxd2410xxx , the first drug in a
new class of microtubule-stabilizing agents
called epothilones, offers a new treatment
option for patients with metastatic or
locally advanced breast cancer who are
refractory to standard chemotherapy.

pharmacokinetics
 xxxd2410xxx  exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the dosage range
of 15â€“57 mg/m2.26 after administration,  xxxd2410xxx  is rapidly distributed across a large volume (>1000 l)
at steady state, indicative of extensive
tissue binding (67â€“77% to serum
proteins) and uptake.26
 xxxd2410xxx  is primarily eliminated by the liver. over 30 metabolites
of  xxxd2410xxx  are produced by oxidative metabolism via cytochrome

of 14[c]- xxxd2410xxx  is eliminated in
the feces and 21% eliminated in the
urine.26
a study of patients with mild-tosevere hepatic impairment (n = 56),
as defined by bilirubin and aspartate
aminotransferase (ast) levels, revealed that dosage modifications are
required in this patient population.
compared with patients with normal
hepatic function (n = 17), the area
under the concentration-versustime curve (auc0â€“âˆž) for  xxxd2410xxx 
increased by 22% in patients with
either bilirubin levels of >1â€“1.5 times
the upper limit of normal (uln)
or an ast level above the uln but
with bilirubin levels of <1.5 times
the uln. the auc0â€“âˆž increased by
30% in patients with bilirubin levels
of >1.5â€“3 times the uln and by 81%
in patients with bilirubin levels of >3
times the uln, irrespective of the
ast level.27
 xxxd2410xxx  has a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 52
hours.23 with the approved dosage
regimen, plasma accumulation is
not expected because the length of
the administration cycle is approximately 10 times that of the terminal
elimination half-life.26
clinical efficacy in metastatic
breast cancer
the clinical efficacy of  xxxd2410xxx , administered as either monotherapy or in combination with
 xxxd425xxx , has been demonstrated
across the spectrum of patients with
advanced breast cancer and is described below.
anthracycline and taxanerefractor y disease. currently,
 xxxd425xxx  represents the standard
reference treatment for patients with
metastatic breast cancer in whom
anthracyclines and taxanes are no
longer effective.28-31 the combination
of  xxxd2410xxx  and  xxxd425xxx  was
considered initially in these patients
because of the different mechanisms

of action and the demonstrated
synergy of the two drugs in human
xenografts.32 therefore, the combination was investigated in an openlabel, phase i/ii study in 62 patients
with metastatic breast cancer who
were previously treated with a taxane and an anthracycline.33,34 in this
study, the combination of  xxxd2410xxx  plus  xxxd425xxx  demonstrated
synergistic antitumor activity and a
manageable safety profile. in patients
for whom response could be evaluated, the objective response rate was
30%. it was concluded that the dosage used in further studies should be

each 21-day cycle with  xxxd425xxx 
1000 mg/m 2 administered orally

21-day cycle.
a randomized phase iii trial of
patients who had measurable locally advanced or metastatic breast
cancer and were previously treated
with or resistant to anthracyclines
and also resistant to taxanes demonstrated that a combination of
 xxxd2410xxx  and  xxxd425xxx  at the
dosages determined from the previous trial had superior clinical efficacy
to  xxxd425xxx  alone (1250 mg/m2
twice daily on days 1â€“14 every 21
days). 19 patients enrolled in this

patients, >90% had received previous chemotherapy for metastatic
breast cancer (48% had one previous

had three previous regimens). all
patients were resistant to taxanes.
approximately 90% of patients had

including those with er/pr/her2negative status and her2-positive

from this study are pending.
a second randomized, phase iii
trial comparing  xxxd2410xxx  plus
 xxxd425xxx  with  xxxd425xxx  alone
in patients with advanced breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes has completed
enrollment.35 patients in this study
did not receive more than two previous chemotherapy regimens, and
those who did not receive treatment
for metastatic disease must have relapsed within one year of treatment.
the primary outcome measure in
this trial was overall survival. the
secondary outcome measured the
quality of life and time to progression, objective response rate, and
duration of response in patients with
measurable disease.
an earlier multicenter, single-arm,
phase ii study investigated  xxxd2410xxx  monotherapy (40 mg/m2 as
a three-hour infusion every three
weeks) administered to 49 patients
with metastatic breast cancer who experienced disease progression while
receiving taxane therapy or within
4 months of it (6 months if taxanes
were used only in the adjuvant setting) and in patients who were
given a taxane as their last regimen.18

anthracycline-based regimen. an
objective response rate of 12% (all
partial responses) and a median time

three weeks) was investigated in 126
patients with metastatic breast cancer resistant to previous therapy with
anthracyclines, taxanes, and  xxxd425xxx .15 of the 126 patients enrolled,
88% had received two or more previous chemotherapy regimens in the

years had elapsed since the completion of treatment, the majority of
patients (83%) had not received a

with metastatic breast cancer who
had not received a taxane but were
permitted to have received other previous therapy (e.g., an anthracycline,
 xxxd425xxx , or both), which had
been received by 70% of patients.17
 xxxd2410xxx  was administered at a
dosage of 6 mg/m2 by i.v. infusion
over one hour on five consecutive days every three weeks. after a
median of 8 cycles of  xxxd2410xxx

first-line therapy. a portion of
the patients included in the clinical
trials described received no previous chemotherapy or anthracyclines
and taxanes in the adjuvant setting
and were therefore treated with
 xxxd2410xxx  as first-line therapy in
the metastatic setting. this included
all 65 patients in the study who had
previously been treated with an adjuvant anthracycline regimen,16 7 of
23 taxane-naive patients who had not
received any previous chemotherapy
and 9 of the 23 who had received
adjuvant anthracycline therapy,17
and 26 of 375 patients (7%) who
received  xxxd2410xxx  plus capeciÂ­
tabine in the randomized, phase iii
study in taxane-resistant patients
who had not received any previous

rates were achieved for  xxxd2410xxx 
administered as first-line therapy in
these studies in comparison with its
use in patients receiving the drug as
second-line or third-line therapy. in
a subset of 55 patients treated in the

plus trastuzumab with docetaxel plus
trastuzumab in patients with her2positive locally advanced disease,
metastatic disease, or both,37 and a
phase i trial of  xxxd2410xxx  plus lapatinib (a dual  xxxg682xxx  and her2 inhibitor) in patients with her2-positive
metastatic breast cancer.38
a randomized, phase ii, threegroup trial comparing two schedules
of  xxxd2410xxx  plus bevacizumab
with paclitaxel plus bevacizumab as
first-line therapy in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic disease
is ongoing.39 results from these trials
will better define the role of  xxxd2410xxx  in combination with targeted

clinical efficacy in different patient subgroups. in the clinical studies of  xxxd2410xxx , patients were enrolled regardless of their her2 status
and  xxxg1603xxx  status.15,16,18,19
patients with her2-positive tumors
were required to have previously
discontinued trastuzumab. in the
phase iii trial comparing  xxxd2410xxx 
plus  xxxd425xxx  with  xxxd425xxx 
alone in patients with metastatic
disease resistant to taxanes, analysis
of pfs in prespecified patient subsets
revealed that the clinical benefits of
 xxxd2410xxx  plus  xxxd425xxx  were
achieved in the majority of patient
subgroups.19 there were significant
differences favoring the combination

regimen over  xxxd425xxx  alone in
relation to receptor status (notably for her2-positive and er/pr/
her2-negative tumors); previous
chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease (anthracycline resistant
and taxane resistant); and patient
characteristics, including age (greater
or less than 50 years), karnofsky performance status, and presence of visceral disease. no data were available
for patients in relation to ethnicity or
the presence of liver dysfunction.
clinical trials of  xxxd2410xxx  have
included patients with poor prognosis, patients with triple-negative
tumors, and patients with extensive
and aggressive tumor burden. in
three phase ii and iii clinical trials
of  xxxd2410xxx , patients with triplenegative tumors accounted for approximately 25â€“35% of the patients
enrolled.15,18,19 most of the patients
enrolled in the phase ii and iii studies of  xxxd2410xxx  had an extensive
and aggressive tumor burden, as
evidenced by the high percentages of
patients with visceral metastases and
multiple involved disease sites.15-19
the clinical activity of  xxxd2410xxx 
was evident in both of these groups
of patients.15-19
complete pathological response
(pcr) rate was documented in a
study in which up to four cycles of
 xxxd2410xxx  (40 mg/m2 infused over
three hours every three weeks) were
administered as primary systemic
(neoadjuvant) therapy to patients
with invasive breast cancer (stages
iiaâ€“iiib) before undergoing surgery
(n = 164).40 a total of 29 patients
achieved pcr, and of those, 17 (11%)
also had pcr in the axillary lymph
nodes. this response rate compares
favorably with other monotherapy
regimens in this population.
safety
 xxxd2410xxx  demonstrated a predictable and manageable safety
profile when used at the dosage and
administration schedule (40 mg/
m2 i.v. over three hours every three

 xxxd2410xxx 

weeks) during clinical trials, and its
toxicities do not appear to overlap
with those of  xxxd425xxx .15,16,18,19
in phase ii and iii clinical trials,
the most clinically relevant adverse
events associated with  xxxd2410xxx 
were myelosuppression (primarily
neutropenia) and peripheral neuropathy. table 2 provides a summary of adverse events reported in
phase ii clinical trials of  xxxd2410xxx 
monotherapy.15-18
in the phase iii trial, grade 3 or
4 neutropenia occurred in 68% of
patients receiving  xxxd2410xxx  plus
 xxxd425xxx  compared with 11% of
patients receiving  xxxd425xxx  alone.
febrile neutropenia was experienced
by 4% of patients with the combination versus less than 1% with capeciÂ­
tabine alone. grade 3 or 4 (i.e., severe
or disabling) neuropathy occurred
in 23% of patients receiving the
combination of  xxxd2410xxx  plus
 xxxd425xxx  versus 0% with  xxxd425xxx  alone.19 the neuropathy was
primarily sensory and cumulative but
was reversible with a median time to
resolution of six weeks.19 grade 3 or
4 handâ€“foot syndrome occurred with
equal frequency in the two groups
(18% versus 17%, respectively), as
did grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal
disturbances such as nausea (3%
versus 2%), vomiting (4% versus
2%), and diarrhea (6% versus 9%).
these findings suggest that  xxxd2410xxx  does not increase the handâ€“
foot syndrome and gastrointestinal
toxicity associated with  xxxd425xxx 
and, similarly, that  xxxd425xxx 
does not exacerbate neuropathy associated with  xxxd2410xxx .
neutropenia. myelosuppression
with  xxxd2410xxx  primarily manifests as neutropenia. grade 3 or 4
neutropenia occurred in 22â€“58% of
patients in the phase ii clinical trials
and in 68% of patients who received
the combination of  xxxd2410xxx  and
 xxxd425xxx  in the phase iii trial.19
neutropenia is generally manageable

the incidence of febrile neutropenia reported in phase ii and iii trials
has been low (table 2).16,18,19
peripheral sensory neuropathy.
neuropathy is a characteristic adverse
event of microtubule-stabilizing
agents.42 the peripheral sensory neuropathy reported in clinical trials of
 xxxd2410xxx  has primarily been mild
to moderate in severity and mostly
reversible within an acceptable time
frame (median time to resolution,
six weeks).19 grade 3 or 4 neuropathy
occurred in 0â€“20% of patients treated with  xxxd2410xxx  monotherapy
in phase ii trials (table 2) and 23%
of patients treated with  xxxd2410xxx 
plus  xxxd425xxx  in the phase iii
trial.19 it has been postulated that less
peripheral neuropathy may occur
with  xxxd2410xxx  when used as firstline therapy in taxane-naive patients,
but this remains to be confirmed.39
there are no proven treatments
for peripheral neuropathy associated with microtubule-stabilizing
agents.41 it is not possible to predict
the occurrence of this adverse event;
therefore, health care team members who care for patients receiving
 xxxd2410xxx  should be aware of the
onset of symptoms (i.e., burning
sensation, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, and
neuropathic pain) and take appropriate action, including delayed
administration of the next dose and
dosage reduction. treatment should
not be restarted until neuropathy has
returned to baseline or is a grade 1 or
lower in severity.
management of other adverse
events. as the  xxxd2410xxx  infusion
solution contains cremophor el,
which may cause hypersensitivity
reactions in some patients, premedication with antihistamines (i.e., both
histamine h 1 -receptor and h 2 receptor antagonists) is necessary to
reduce the risk of such reactions.16
however, in contrast to premedication for taxanes,42,43 corticosteroid
premedication is not required with
 xxxd2410xxx  unless the patient has

clinical review

had a hypersensitivity reaction to
a previous administration of the
drug.
in addition to dosage adjustments and delay in administration,
supportive care interventions may
be required for specific adverse
events associated with  xxxd2410xxx 
administered with or without capeciÂ­
tabine.42,44 interventions that may
be considered include the following:
analgesics for myalgia and arthralgia, anesthetic mouthwashes for the
treatment of stomatitis or mucositis,
antiemetics for nausea and vomiting,
emollients for handâ€“foot syndrome
due to  xxxd425xxx  in combined
regimens, and antidiarrheals and
fluid replacement for diarrhea (prophylactic antibiotics may be indicated for patients with diarrhea and
neutropenia).
dosage and administration
multiple doses and schedules of
 xxxd2410xxx  were evaluated during
the clinical development of the drug.8
initially, dosages as high as 50 mg/
m2 every three weeks were evaluated;
however, the severity and extent of
the neuropathy forced a lowering
of the dosage for further evaluation to the current recommended
dosage.8,34 other dosage schedules
have also been evaluated, including  xxxd2410xxx  6 mg/m2 daily for
five days every three weeks showing
activity and tolerability in women
who never received taxanes before
taking  xxxd2410xxx .17 however, the
 xxxd2410xxx  dosage recommended
by the manufacturer is 40 mg/m2
administered i.v. over three hours every three weeks. dosages for patients
with a body surface area greater than
2.2 m2 should be calculated based on
2.2 m2.26
dosage adjustments for toxicities. if toxicities are detected during
treatment, therapy should be delayed
to allow recovery.26 dosage adjustment guidelines for  xxxd2410xxx 
monotherapy and combination
therapy are shown in table 3.

dosage adjustments at the start of
a cycle should be based on toxicity
assessments from the preceding cycle.
patients should not begin a new cycle
of treatment unless the neutrophil
count is â‰¥1,500 cells/mm3, the platelet count is â‰¥100,000 cells/mm3, and
nonhematologic toxicities have resolved or improved to grade 1 (mild).
if toxicities recur, an additional 20%
dose reduction is required.26
dosage adjustments in patients
with hepatic impairment. patients

 xxxd2410xxx 

with hepatic impairment should
receive  xxxd2410xxx  based on the
guidelines in table 3. in the case of
 xxxd2410xxx  monotherapy, patients
with moderate hepatic impairment
should be started at 20 mg/m2. the
dosage in subsequent cycles may be
adjusted upward to, but not exceeding, 30 mg/m2 if tolerated. use of
 xxxd2410xxx  is not recommended in
patients with ast or  xxxg941xxx  (alt) levels more than
10 times the uln or bilirubin levels

more than 3 times the uln. limited
data are available for patients with
baseline ast or alt levels more
than 5 times the uln. caution
should be used when treating these
patients.26
patients receiving combination
treatment who have ast and alt
levels less than or equal to 2.5 times
the uln and bilirubin levels less
than or equal to 1 time the uln may
receive the standard dose of  xxxd2410xxx  (40 mg/m2).26
dosage adjustments in patients
receiving cyp3a4 isoenzyme inhibitors. the use of concomitant
potent cyp3a4 inhibitors (e.g.,
ketoconazole) should be avoided.
grapefruit juice may also increase
plasma concentrations of  xxxd2410xxx  and should also be avoided.
guidelines to follow in the event that
a potent cyp3a4 inhibitor must be
coadministered are given in table 3.
if a potent cyp3a4 inhibitor is discontinued, approximately one week
of washout should be allowed before
escalating the  xxxd2410xxx  dose.26 the
effect of mild or moderate cyp3a4
inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, fluconazole, verapamil) on  xxxd2410xxx 
pharmacokinetics has not been
studied; thus, caution should be used
when mild or moderate cyp3a4 inhibitors are administered in patients
receiving  xxxd2410xxx .
premedication. to minimize the
risk of a hypersensitivity reaction,
all patients must be premedicated
approximately one hour before the
infusion of  xxxd2410xxx  with an h1receptor antagonist (e.g.,  xxxd1906xxx  50 mg orally)
and an h2-receptor antagonist (e.g.,
ranitidine 150â€“300 mg orally).26
patients who have had a previous
hypersensitivity reaction to  xxxd2410xxx  require corticosteroid premedication (e.g., dexamethasone phosphate 20 mg i.v. 30 minutes before
infusion or dexamethasone 20 mg
orally 60 minutes before infusion)
in addition to pretreatment with h1and h2-antagonists.26

preparation and administration.
 xxxd2410xxx  is supplied as two vials,
one containing  xxxd2410xxx  powder
and another containing mandatory
diluent. only the supplied diluent
must be used for constituting
 xxxd2410xxx  for injection. to minimize the risk of dermal exposure,
impervious gloves should be worn
when handling vials containing
 xxxd2410xxx .26
both vials must be stored under
refrigeration at 2â€“8 Â°c (36â€“46 Â°f) in
the original package to protect them
from light. before reconstitution,
the vials should be placed at room
temperature for 30 minutes. when
the diluent is first removed from
the refrigerator, a white precipitate
may be seen but will dissolve to form
a clear solution once the diluent
warms to room temperature. after
reconstitution, the concentration of
 xxxd2410xxx  is 2 mg/ml. the solution
may be stored in the vial, not the syringe, for a maximum of one hour at
room temperature and room lighting
conditions.26
before administration, the solution must be further diluted only
with lactated ringerâ€™s injection,
usp, supplied in di(2-ethylhexyl)
phthalate-free bags. this diluent is
specified because it has a ph range of
6.0â€“7.5, which is required to maintain  xxxd2410xxx â€™s stability. other
diluents should not be used. the
final  xxxd2410xxx  concentration for
infusion must be 0.2â€“0.6 mg/ml.
this solution is stable at room temperature and light for a maximum of
six hours. administration of diluted
 xxxd2410xxx  must therefore be completed within this period.26
role in therapy
 xxxd2410xxx  is the first semisynthetic  xxxd2854xxx  analog with
labeling approved by fda and represents an important addition to the
current armamentarium of drugs
for the treatment of metastatic and
locally advanced breast cancer. in patients with metastatic breast cancer,

am j health-syst pharmâ€”vol 65 nov 1, 2008

 xxxd2410xxx  has demonstrated a lack
of complete cross-resistance with
other drugs used to treat advanced
breast cancer.15,18,19 clinically meaningful benefits have been achieved
with  xxxd2410xxx  monotherapy in
patients in whom anthracyclines,
taxanes, and  xxxd425xxx  all failed to
provide a response.15 the synergistic
activity of a combination of  xxxd2410xxx  and  xxxd425xxx  has been confirmed in a phase iii trial in patients
who had previously failed on taxanes
and anthracyclines; a combination
of  xxxd2410xxx  and  xxxd425xxx  was
significantly more effective in producing an objective response and in
prolonging pfs than  xxxd425xxx 
alone.19 at the dosage and administration schedule recommended by
the manufacturer in patients meeting
the eligibility criteria for treatment,
the therapeutic ratio of  xxxd2410xxx 
is generally favorable, and adverse
events are generally manageable and
reversible.
 xxxd2410xxx  has demonstrated
activity in her2-positive and her2negative patients. in the phase iii
trial, 9% of patients in the  xxxd2410xxx  plus  xxxd425xxx  group had received previous trastuzumab therapy
and 16% were her2-positive.19 for
patients with advanced breast cancer
who have progressed following trastuzumab treatment, a combination
of lapatinib plus  xxxd425xxx  is a
viable treatment option. the physician can determine whether a patient
with resistance is still a candidate for
anti-her2 therapy. however, clinical
trials are underway to investigate the
potential of combining  xxxd2410xxx 
plus trastuzumab or lapatinib for the
treatment of breast cancer.
chemotherapy remains the treatment of choice for patients with
hormone-unresponsive or hormoneresistant metastatic breast cancer,
her2-negative tumors, extensive
visceral disease, or life-threatening
and rapidly progressing disease. 3
the profiles of patients enrolled in
completed clinical trials that have

clinical review

included patients previously treated
with anthracyclines and taxanes
across multiple lines of therapy for
metastatic breast cancer provide
guidance on the indications for the
use of  xxxd2410xxx  and may help select patients who will likely benefit
from  xxxd2410xxx  therapy.39 on the
basis of the results of these trials, appropriate indications for  xxxd2410xxx 
can be suggested. these indications
include first-line, second-line, thirdline, or higher therapies in patients
with metastatic breast cancer previously treated with or resistant to anthracycline therapy, taxane therapy,
or both18,19,35; first-line therapy in
patients with metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines or taxanes in the adjuvant
setting16; and third- or fourth-line
therapy in patients with metastatic
disease previously treated with anthracyclines, taxanes, and capeciÂ­
tabine. 15 in addition,  xxxd2410xxx 
has been evaluated in patients whose
disease progressed during treatment with anthracyclines because
of resistance (progressive disease) or
patients who reached the maximum
cumulative dose of anthracyclines.
patients in these categories have been
evaluated in a clinical trial that compared  xxxd2410xxx  plus  xxxd425xxx 
with  xxxd425xxx  alone.34
significant efforts are ongoing to
identify predictive and prognostic
biomarkers to identify patients who
are most likely to respond to  xxxd2410xxx  treatment. although initial
results suggest that certain biomarkers (e.g., er status, expression of the
 xxxg1375xxx )
and gene signatures are predictive of
responsiveness to  xxxd2410xxx ; however, these findings have not been
fully validated.40,45
some patients may be at an increased risk for adverse events and
may not be candidates for therapy
with  xxxd2410xxx  or may require
treatment using a reduced dosage
of  xxxd2410xxx . these include patients with abnormal liver function

tests (ast or alt levels more than
2.5 times the uln or bilirubin levels
more than 1 time the uln), who
may be at increased risk of treatmentrelated mortality.19 in these patients,
the dosage of  xxxd2410xxx  given as
monotherapy should be reduced
according to the degree of hepatic
impairment. use of  xxxd2410xxx  as
monotherapy is not recommended in
patients with ast or alt levels more
than 10 times the uln or bilirubin
levels more than 3 times the uln,
and the combination of  xxxd2410xxx 
with  xxxd425xxx  is contraindicated
in patients with ast or alt levels
more than 2.5 times the uln or
bilirubin levels more than 1 time the
uln.
the use of  xxxd2410xxx  is also not
recommended in patients with a neutrophil count of less than 1,500 cells/
mm3, a platelet count of less than
100,000/mm3, or preexisting peripheral neuropathy of grade 2 or higher.
patients with neuropathy of grade 2
or higher were not eligible for enrollment in clinical trials of  xxxd2410xxx .
 xxxd2410xxx  should be administered
with caution to patients with coexisting medical conditions associated
with peripheral neuropathy such as
diabetes mellitus or a substantial history of alcohol use, who also appear
to be prone to neurotoxicity with
paclitaxel.39,46 patients with diabetes
mellitus treated with  xxxd2410xxx 
may be at increased risk of severe
neuropathy.
caution is also warranted in patients receiving treatment with other
drugs that are potent inhibitors of
cyp3a4 isoenzymes (i.e., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin,
 xxxd239xxx , nefazodone, saquinavir,
telithromycin, ritonavir,  xxxd166xxx ,
indinavir, nelfinavir, delavirdine, or
 xxxd3528xxx ).26 since oxidative metabolism by cyp3a4 and  xxxg592xxx 
appears to be a prominent route
of biotransformation of  xxxd2410xxx , concomitant administration of
cyp3a4 inhibitors may significantly
increase exposure to the drug. in

 xxxd2410xxx 

such cases, the starting dose should
be reduced. in addition, use of  xxxd2410xxx  is not recommended in
patients with a history of hypersensitivity to drugs formulated with
cremophor el because  xxxd2410xxx 
infusion solution is formulated with
this compound.
 xxxd2410xxx  is indicated in combination with  xxxd425xxx  for the
treatment of metastatic or locally
advanced breast cancer in patients
refractory to anthracycline and taxane therapy, and as monotherapy
for the treatment of metastatic or
locally advanced breast cancer in
patients after failure of an anthracycline, a taxane, and  xxxd425xxx .
as well as demonstrating benefits in
anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated
patients,  xxxd2410xxx  appears to be
effective across all lines of therapy
and in different subtypes of breast
cancer patients with extensive or aggressive disease. future studies will
further define the role of  xxxd2410xxx 
in relation to the taxanes and other
drugs used in the treatment of breast
cancer.
conclusion
 xxxd2410xxx , the first drug in a
new class of microtubule-stabilizing
agents called epothilones, offers a
new treatment option for patients
with metastatic or locally advanced
breast cancer who are refractory to
standard chemotherapy.
