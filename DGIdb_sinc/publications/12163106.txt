abstract
the effect of the isoquinoline derivative,  xxxd1947xxx  on the specific binding of [3h] xxxd2737xxx  and [3h]diltiazem to pregnant rat uterine
membranes was examined.  xxxd1947xxx  inhibited the specific [3h] xxxd2737xxx  and [3h]diltiazem bindings with ic50 values of 5.6 and 2.6
am, respectively. saturation studies showed that diltiazem caused a significant increase in the maximum binding density without changing
the kd of [3h] xxxd2737xxx  while  xxxd1947xxx  increased both the kd and the bmax of [3h] xxxd2737xxx . the dissociation kinetics of both
[3h] xxxd2737xxx  and [3h]diltiazem were accelerated by  xxxd1947xxx . these results suggest that  xxxd1947xxx  has a negative allosteric
interaction with the binding sites for 1,4-dihydropyridines and 1,5-benzothiazepines on the l-type ca2 + channel in pregnant rat uterine
membranes, which may have implications as to the potential usefulness of this drug in aiding child delivery.

1. introduction
control of the smooth muscle in the uterus (myometrium) is of vital importance during pregnancy and parturition. uterine muscle contractions can be stimulated by many
endogenous and exogenous substances through various
mechanisms (for review, see wray, 1993). uterine activation
occurs late in pregnancy, which prepares it to perform the
contractions typical of labor (olson et al., 1995).
increased intracellular calcium concentration is essential
for triggering contraction in uterine smooth muscle cells
(inoue and sperlakis, 1991; taggart et al., 1996). a pivotal
mechanism for increasing intracellular calcium concentration is through uterine voltage-dependent l-type ca2 +
channels (young et al., 1993; sanborn, 2000). emerging
evidence indicates the existence of gestational changes
among the myriads of mechanisms recruited near term to
coordinate ca2 + signalling and force production needed for
the development of effective uterine contractions, which
lead to progressive dilatation of the uterine cervix and

delivery of the fetus (taggart et al., 1996). involvement of
l-type ca2 + channels in regulation of these processes is
most probable.
the l-type ca2 + channels are multimeric protein complexes that are expressed in many different cell types
including striated (skeletal and cardiac) and smooth muscle
cells (davila, 1999; triggle, 1999). the a1 subunit is the
principal subunit of the l-type ca2 + channel and contains
the voltage-gated channel pore. six distinct genes have been
identified encoding homologous a1 subunits. the ‘‘cardiac’’
(a1c-a) and the ‘‘smooth muscle’’ (a1c-b) proteins are
splice products of the class-c ca2 + channel a1 gene
(welling et al., 1997; triggle, 1999; davila, 1999). these
a1c subunits are the major targets for all known ca2 +
channel blockers, such as dihydropyridines (e.g.  xxxd2737xxx , nifedipine, isradipine), benzothiazepines (e.g. diltiazem and clentiazem) and the phenylalkylamines (e.g.
verapamil, desmethoxyverapamil). these l-type-selective
ca2 + channel antagonists bind to separate binding sites,
which are allosterically linked by negative or positive
heterotropic interactions (catterall and striessnig, 1992;
spedding and paoletti, 1992; hockerman et al., 1997;
varadi et al., 1999; triggle, 1999). these types of allosteric
interaction have been shown to be species, temperature,
tissue, cation and ligand dependent. the a1c-a and a1c-b

isoforms have different sensitivities to dihydropyridines
displaying no clearcut differences in their electrophysiological properties (davila, 1999).
l-type ca2 + channel is present in both the non-pregnant
and pregnant uterus but is up-regulated near term (inoue and
sperlakis, 1991; yoshino et al., 1997; okabe et al., 1999).
ca2 + channel antagonists have been shown to inhibit
uterine smooth muscle contractility both in vitro and in
vivo; moreover, ca2 + channel blockers seem to have the
greatest effect on myometrial relaxation (higby and suiter,
1999).
more recently, an endogenous inhibitor of uterine contractions acting at the dihydropyridine binding sites of the
uterine l-type ca2 + channels was described to be released
in greater amounts from fetal membranes before term than at
term (carroll et al., 2001). this observation further emphasizes the potential role of uterine l-type ca2 + channel
blockade in maintaining uterine quiescence and in regulating the transition into labor.
the isoquinoline derivative,  xxxd1947xxx  is a potent
spasmolytic agent which has been on the market for more
than 35 years.  xxxd1947xxx  was shown to inhibit human
camp-specific phosphodiesterase type 4 enzyme with an
ic50 value of 3.3 am (blaskó, 1998; kapui, 1998). more
recently, a controlled clinical trial has been performed which
has shown some important effects for  xxxd1947xxx  on some
parameters of physiological deliveries, i.e.  xxxd1947xxx  significantly shortened the time course of dilatation stage and
significantly lowered the incidence of cervical rupture
(demeter et al., 1999).
the purpose of the present study was to verify whether
 xxxd1947xxx  has ca2 + channel blocking properties in pregnant uterine smooth muscle which may contribute to its
spasmolytic effect elicited by inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 4 enzyme. preliminary experiments showed that
 xxxd1947xxx  could effect the binding of [3h] xxxd2737xxx .

was opened and both uterine horns were removed and
separated from fat deposits and mesenteric attachments.
2.3. membrane preparation
pregnant rat uterine membranes were prepared as previously described (batra and popper, 1989) with minor
modifications. the myometrium was homogenized in 10
vol of sucrose– hepes buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm
hepes –naoh, ph 7.2) and centrifuged at 12 000  g for
15 min at 4 jc. the supernatant was pelleted by means of
two consecutive centrifugation cycles (40 000  g, 1 h, 4
jc) with intermittant resuspension of the pellet in fresh
buffer. the microsomal pellet obtained was suspended in 50
mm tris –hcl buffer (ph 7.2 at 25 jc) and used immediately for binding assay. the protein concentration of the
resultant membrane preparation was measured by the
method of bradford (1976) using bovine  xxxg124xxx 
as standard.
2.4. radioligand binding

[3h] xxxd2737xxx  (87 ci/mmol) and d-cis-[3h]diltiazem
(84 ci/mmol) were purchased from new england nuclear.
 xxxd2737xxx , d-cis-diltiazem hydrochloride were obtained
from sigma.  xxxd1947xxx  was supplied by
 xxxd2908xxx  (tó utca 1-5, budapest, hungary, h-1045).

for [3h] xxxd2737xxx  competition studies, aliquots of the
membrane preparation (300 –500 ag protein) were incubated with 0.3 nm [3h] xxxd2737xxx  in 50 mm tris –hcl
buffer (ph 7.2) in a final volume of 1 ml for 90 min at 25 jc
under reduced room lighting. nonspecific binding was
defined by 1 am unlabeled  xxxd2737xxx . for [3h]diltiazem
competition studies, aliquots of the membrane preparation
(1 mg protein) were incubated with 10 nm [3h]diltiazem in
a final volume of 0.5 ml of 50 mm tris – hcl buffer (ph
7.2) containing 0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  for 90 min at 25
jc under reduced room lighting. nonspecific binding was
determined by 10 am unlabeled diltiazem. after incubation,
the samples were filtered through whatman gf/b
([3h] xxxd2737xxx  binding) or gf/c pretreated with 0.3%
polyethylenimine ([3h]diltiazem binding; chatelain et al.,
1993) and washed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold buffer
using a cell harvester. the radioactivity remained on the
filter was counted in 3 ml of optiphase hisafe (wallac)
scintillation cocktail at an efficiency of approximately 50%.
dissociation kinetics were measured by preincubating
[3h] xxxd2737xxx  (0.5 nm) or [3h]diltiazem (5 nm) with
membrane protein for 90 min at 25 jc. then an excess of
unlabeled  xxxd2737xxx  (1 am) or unlabeled diltiazem (10
am) was added with or without (control) other drugs. at
defined time, the samples in triplicate were filtered.

2.2. animals

2.5. data analysis

primigravid sprague – dawley rats at days 18– 20 of the
21-day gestation period were used. at the time of the acute
experiment, the duration of gestation was confirmed by
comparing the fetal size with known standards. tissues
from implantation sites were not used. rats were anaesthetized with ether and killed by decapitation. the abdomen

the ic50 values and hill slopes for competition binding
data were obtained using a nonlinear method (sigmaplot for
windows version 4.00). the equilibrium dissociation constant (kd) and the maximal number of binding sites (bmax)
were estimated by linear regression analysis after scatchard
transformation of the radioligand saturation binding data.

2. materials and methods

the dissociation rate constant (k 1) was determined from
linear regression analysis of log bt/be vs. time, where bt and
be were the specific binding at t time and at equilibrium,
respectively. the dissociation half-life (t1/2) is equal to log
0.5/k 1.
all experiments were performed in triplicate and data are
expressed as mean f s.e.m. of three to five independent
experiments. statistical analysis was performed by using a
one-sample, two-tailed t-test and one-way analysis of variance, followed by dunnett’s test. all the calculations were
performed by sasr 6.12 (sasr institute, cary, nc).
values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

 xxxd2737xxx  competitively inhibited [3h] xxxd2737xxx 
with an ic50 of 0.40 f 0.07 nm (ki = 0.25 f 0.04 nm,
n = 5). the value of hill slope for  xxxd2737xxx  was close
to unity suggesting the presence of a homogenous population of  xxxd2737xxx  binding sites in the pregnant rat uterine
membranes. specific binding of [3h] xxxd2737xxx  was completely displaced by  xxxd1947xxx  in a concentration-dependent fashion.  xxxd1947xxx  inhibited [3h] xxxd2737xxx  binding
with an ic50 value of 5.6 f 1.11 am (n = 5). the value of
hill slope for  xxxd1947xxx  at displacing [3h] xxxd2737xxx 
binding was significantly ( p < 0.001) less than unity
(0.49 f 0.03) suggesting a more complex interaction than
a simple competition for a single common site between
[ 3h] xxxd2737xxx  and  xxxd1947xxx . diltiazem markedly
enhanced the binding of [3h] xxxd2737xxx  to pregnant rat
uterine membranes at 25 jc, with a maximal stimulation of
156 f 5%. the value of half-maximal enhancement concentration (ed50) was equal to 134 f 17 nm (n = 5).
the specific binding of [3h]diltiazem at a concentration of 10 nm was completely inhibited both by diltiazem (ic 5 0 = 35 f 6.6 nm, n = 3) and  xxxd1947xxx 
(ic50 = 2.6 f 0.77 am, n = 3). the values of hill slopes
for both diltiazem and  xxxd1947xxx  were not significantly
different from unity.  xxxd2737xxx  increased the specific
binding of [3h]diltiazem in a concentration-dependent
manner up to 136%.
we performed scatchard analysis to determine [3h] xxxd2737xxx  saturation isotherms with and without 5 am
 xxxd1947xxx , a concentration causing approximately 50%
inhibition of [3h] xxxd2737xxx  binding to pregnant rat uterine
membranes (fig. 2, solid circles).  xxxd1947xxx  resulted in a
remarkable reduction in the apparent affinity of [3h] xxxd2737xxx  (kd = 1.55 f 0.28 nm, n = 5, p < 0.001), as compared
to control treatment, and a pronounced increase of bmax
value (bmax = 70.6 f 10.8 fmol/mg protein, n = 5, p < 0.01).
these results also suggest that  xxxd1947xxx  interacts with
[3h] xxxd2737xxx  binding sites in a noncompetitive and
allosteric manner. diltiazem, the well-known allosteric
enhancer of [3h] xxxd2737xxx  binding, at a concentration of
5 am significantly increased the bmax value (bmax = 68.2 f
6.5 fmol/mg protein, n = 5, p < 0.01) while the apparent kd
value of [3h] xxxd2737xxx  binding was not affected (fig. 2,
solid squares).
we did not succeed in performing saturation analysis of
[3h]diltiazem binding to pregnant rat uterine membranes
because of the high level of nonspecific binding ( > 60% of
the total binding when radioligand concentration was
increased above 40 nm). however, total and nonspecific
bindings of [3h]diltiazem were increased in a concentrationdependent manner, indicating that the radioligand is valid
for labeling of the relevant binding site in pregnant rat
uterine membranes.
the value of hill slope for  xxxd1947xxx  at displacing
[3h]diltiazem approximated unity which might be indicative
of a competitive interaction for  xxxd1947xxx  with the [3h]diltiazem binding sites.

according to ehlert (1988), the inhibition of radioligand
binding to specific binding sites by an allosteric modulator
is likely to be observed as apparent competitive inhibition
when the magnitude of negative heterotropic cooperativity
is large. therefore, we examined the effects of  xxxd1947xxx 
on the dissociation kinetics of [3h] xxxd2737xxx  and [3h]diltiazem. effects on modification of the dissociation rate of a
radioligand by an unlabeled drug have been widely used to
indicate whether a compound is acting at the same site as the
radioligand (unchanged dissociation rate) or at a different,
allosterically linked site (faster or slower dissociation rate)
(spedding and paoletti, 1992).
the effects of  xxxd1947xxx  on the dissociation kinetics of
[3h] xxxd2737xxx  and [3h]diltiazem at 25 jc were assessed
to further clarify the mechanism of the  xxxd1947xxx  interaction with these two binding sites on the l-type ca2 +

channel (table 1). the dissociation rates of [3h] xxxd2737xxx 
and [3h]diltiazem were best fitted as monoexponential
processes.  xxxd1947xxx , at a concentration of 30 am, significantly increased the dissociation rate constant of both
radioligands, while the dissociation rate constant of
[3h] xxxd2737xxx  and that of [3h]diltiazem was allosterically
decreased by diltiazem and  xxxd2737xxx , respectively.

4. discussion

fig. 2. (a) effect of  xxxd1947xxx  and diltiazem on the equilibrium saturation
binding of [3h] xxxd2737xxx  to pregnant rat uterine membranes. the typical
results of the equilibrium saturation binding of [3h] xxxd2737xxx  are shown.
equilibrium binding was measured in the absence (o) and in the presence
of 5 am  xxxd1947xxx  (.), or in the presence of 5 am diltiazem (n).
nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 am  xxxd2737xxx .
(b) scatchard plot of the data is shown in panel (a). kd (nm) and bmax
(fmol/mg protein) values are summarized in the text.

in the present study,  xxxd1947xxx  was found to interact
both with 1,4-dihydropyridine ( xxxd2737xxx ) and 1,5-benzothiazepine (diltiazem) binding to the l-type ca2 + channels
of pregnant rat uterine membranes with ic50 values of 5.6
and 2.6 am, respectively.
scatchard analysis of [3h] xxxd2737xxx  binding to pregnant rat uterine membranes indicated a single population of
homologous binding sites with a kd value of 0.47 nm and a
bmax value of 33.5 fmol/mg protein. similar high affinity
binding for [3h] xxxd2737xxx  was previously reported in
uterine membranes (grover et al., 1984; yousif et al.,
1985; batra and popper, 1989).
the results from the competition and saturation studies
suggested that both  xxxd1947xxx  and diltiazem interact
with [3h] xxxd2737xxx  binding sites in an allosteric manner. the value of hill slope for  xxxd1947xxx  at displacing
[3h] xxxd2737xxx  was significantly less than unity, moreover,  xxxd1947xxx  affected both the kd and bmax values
for [3h] xxxd2737xxx  binding.
diltiazem increased the binding of [3h] xxxd2737xxx ,
which was achieved by increasing the number of binding

z. tömösközi et al. / european journal of pharmacology 449 (2002) 55–60

sites available without affecting the apparent affinity for
[3h] xxxd2737xxx . similarly,  xxxd2737xxx  increased [3h]diltiazem binding. allosteric interactions of diltiazem binding
with other binding sites on the ca2 + channel was earlier
observed in other systems (e.g. schoemaker and langer,
1985; schoemaker et al., 1987; chatelain et al., 1993).
the dissociation kinetics of [3h] xxxd2737xxx  and
3
[ h]diltiazem were slowed down by diltiazem and  xxxd2737xxx , respectively, clearly demonstrating a mutually
positive heterotropic allosteric interaction between the
 xxxd2737xxx  and diltiazem binding sites of the l-type
ca2 + channels of pregnant rat uterine membranes, which
is also in line with the mutual promotion of each others
binding (see above).
on the other hand, the dissociation kinetics of both
[3h] xxxd2737xxx  and [3h]diltiazem were accelerated by
 xxxd1947xxx . these results suggested that  xxxd1947xxx 
interacted with a binding site other than that for 1,4dihydropyridines ( xxxd2737xxx ) and 1,5-benzothiazepines
(diltiazem) and the binding site for  xxxd1947xxx  was
linked to these two principal binding sites in a negative
allosteric manner.
verapamil, at a concentration of 10 am, was reported
to inhibit both the contractions and the increase of the
intracellular ca2 + concentration in isolated porcine myometrial strips (kitazawa et al., 2000) indicating a specific
interaction for the phenylalkylamine-type verapamil with
the uterine l-type ca2 + channels.
further studies are needed to clarify whether the site for
 xxxd1947xxx  action on the l-type ca2 + channels of pregnant
rat uterine membranes is either identical to that for phenylalkylamines or whether  xxxd1947xxx  interacts with a site
different from the three described binding sites.
earlier in vitro studies revealed a significant relaxing
effect of  xxxd1947xxx  on pregnant rat uterine horn preparation precontracted with oxytocin (0.001 u/ml) with an ic50
value of 5.1 am (tanev et al., 1982).
our present finding concerning a specific interaction of
 xxxd1947xxx  with the uterine l-type ca2 + channels may be
indicative for a ca2 + channel blocking potency of  xxxd1947xxx . further electrophysiological studies or measurement
of the intracellular ca2 + concentration would be needed to
verify a direct inhibition by  xxxd1947xxx  of the ca2 + influx
via the uterine l-type ca2 + channels.
more recent data suggest that capacitative (or storeoperated) ca2 + entry in pregnant human myometrium
may be sufficient to elicit a contraction even in the presence
of an l-type ca2 + channel blocker (tribe, 2001). in
addition to it, although a change in intracellular ca2 +
concentration is the most important mechanism for the
control of contractile activity in myometrium, several other
mechanisms are able to modulate or perhaps even initiate
tension generation, or to inhibit it, producing relaxation
(bolton et al., 1999; sanborn, 2000; tribe, 2001). thus, in
order to demonstrate unequivocally the role of  xxxd1947xxx 
interaction with the l-type ca2 + channels in the spasmo-

59

lytic effect observed in pregnant rat uterine horn preparation, further studies in the same uterus, on the effect of
 xxxd1947xxx  on radioligand binding, intracellular ca2 + concentration, and contractility will be required.
relaxation between contractions during normal labor
seems to be a much welcomed respite. a blockade of
ca2 + influx via the uterine l-type ca2 + channels may be
a potential mechanism of action in suppressing uterine
dysfunctions linked with an increase in uterine muscular
activity and hence exerting an increase in the relaxation
periods (wray, 1993; tribe, 2001).
recently, a controlled open, phase iv clinical trial has
been performed demonstrating prominent effects for  xxxd1947xxx  on some parameters of human deliveries (demeter,
1998).  xxxd1947xxx , given at a dose of 40 mg (i.m.) in the
stage of cervical dilatation phase to parturients, significantly
( p = 0.005) shortened the time course of dilatation stage and
highly significantly ( p = 0.001) lowered the incidence of
cervical ruptures, which led to decreased obstetrical complications. no increase in the risk of atonia was observed.
although  xxxd1947xxx  caused some lowering in the blood
pressure, this effect may be of beneficial influence on the
stress accompanying labor (demeter et al., 1999).
it should be noted, however, that in the present study, the
interaction of  xxxd1947xxx  with the uterine l-type ca2 +
channels has been examined in rat and not in human.
although there are differences between rat and human
myometrium (tribe, 2001; wray et al., 2001), the implication of  xxxd1947xxx  for human childbirth could be speculated. on the basis of our present results, we assume that
 xxxd1947xxx , exerting a negative allosteric effect on the
binding sites for 1,4-dihydropyridines and 1,5-benzothiazepines of the l-type ca2 + channel in pregnant myometrium,
decreases the ca2 + influx through the channel, which may
lead to a transient suppression of the uterine muscular
hyperactivity and, as a consequence, an increase in blood
and oxygen supply to both the myometrium and the fetus.
the potential ca2 + channel blocking potency of  xxxd1947xxx 
may play a significant role in its effect on the improvement
of the outcomes of deliveries.
in conclusion, in the present study, we have shown a
specific interaction for  xxxd1947xxx  with the l-type ca2 +
channels in pregnant rat uterine membranes. in light of this
observation, we hypothesize that a ca2 + channel modulating potency may contribute to  xxxd1947xxx ’s spasmolytic
effect elicited by inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 4
enzyme. these dual mechanisms of action may explain the
prominent efficacy of  xxxd1947xxx  on human deliveries, and
moreover,  xxxd1947xxx  may provide a useful alternative for
treating premature labor.
