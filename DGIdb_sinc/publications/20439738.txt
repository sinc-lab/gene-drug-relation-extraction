t

he hedgehog signaling pathway, mediated by the smoothened
(smo) receptor, has been shown to regulate stem cells and is
a fundamental regulator of organogenesis in developing embryos
and tissue integrity in mature organisms (1–9). smo agonists have
been proposed as desired therapeutics for restoring tissue function
in diseases associated with heart failure, neuronal injury/degeneration, wound repair, and retinal damage, where they could
reactivate or stimulate repair mechanisms in situations in which
normal regenerative capacity is compromised (10–14). however,
for therapeutic modalities to be acceptable for a previously
undescribed use in humans, clinical safety and efﬁcacy must be
demonstrated to gain u.s. food and drug administration (fda)
approval. some tool compounds of smo, agonists such as purmorphamine, have demonstrated an ability to promote human
embryonic stem cell differentiation (15), but the preclinical development of such small-molecule smo agonists has lagged.
the interaction of hedgehog ligand with the membrane protein patched (ptc) enables the seven- xxxg1608xxx 
smo to activate downstream gli transcription factors (1). activated smo shares important behaviors with canonical g proteincoupled receptors (gpcrs), including an ability to undergo
gpcr kinase phosphorylation and to recruit beta-arrestin2 (betaarr2)
proteins for endocytosis, as shown in our previous study (16).
cyclopamine, a naturally occurring steroid alkaloid, inhibits the
constitutive activity of smo via direct antagonism, preventing its
phosphorylation and interaction with betaarr2. we exploited this
observation to construct high-throughput high-content screens
for smo ligands, with a goal of accelerating the development of
hedgehog agonist drugs that could potentially have a role in
tissue regeneration or be employed as tool compounds to study
stem cell proliferation. we have identiﬁed four ﬂuorinated glucocorticoids,  xxxd2256xxx , ﬂuticasone,  xxxd1719xxx , and ﬂuocinonide (fig. 1a), all fda-approved compounds, as smo agonists
that activate hedgehog signaling and promote the proliferation

results
fluorinated glucocorticoid smo agonist (fgsa) drugs promote
smo intracellular aggregation with betaarr2-gfp and promote smo
internalization. included among the chemical libraries we screened

using a 384-multiwell format was the prestwick chemicals library
containing fda-approved drugs. it contains 68 glucocorticoids or
structurally related steroid compounds, including cortisone and
dexamethasone. the primary screening assay employed u2os cells,
chosen for adherence, ﬂatness, and stable expression of betaarr2-gfp,
and a tail substitution mutant of smo, smo-633, which provided
better sensitivity than wt smo (16, 17). images of smo-633/betaarr2gfp complexes were obtained at the rate of 5,000 per day using an
automated confocal-based plate reader (imagexpress ultra; molecular devices). a read-out of compound activity for each well was
provided by analyzing the corresponding image for changes in betaarr2gfp distribution that occurred as a result of compound addition.
when expressed in cells without the addition of exogenous
smo, betaarr2-gfp is distributed homogenously throughout the
cytoplasm (fig. 1b). the overexpression of smo (16) or smo-633
caused a redistribution of betaarr2-gfp to intracellular vesicles/
aggregates (fig. 1c). at a concentration of 100 nm or greater, the
smo antagonist cyclopamine (18) reverses this effect and forces
betaarr2-gfp back into a homogeneous distribution (fig. 1d).
intravesicular aggregation of betaarr2-gfp can be restored in the
presence of 100 nm cyclopamine with 5 mum smo agonist (sag)
(19) or purmorphamine (20, 21), both of which are known smallmolecule smo agonists (fig. 1 e and f). in our primary assay,
a smo agonist is identiﬁed by its ability to aggregate betaarr2-gfp in
the presence of 100 nm cyclopamine in the steady-state model.
similar to the positive control, each hit compound at 5 mum
overcame the inhibition by 100 nm cyclopamine to produce intracellular betaarr2-gfp aggregates (fig. 1 g–j). hit compound
agonist activities in u2os cells were also conﬁrmed using
a betaarr2-gfp assay with wt smo (16) (fig. s1). as assessed
using the primary assay, the ec50s for  xxxd2256xxx , ﬂuticasone,
 xxxd1719xxx , and ﬂuocinonide are 1.1 ± 0.1 mum, 99 ± 1.4 nm, 1.5 ±
0.1 mum, and >5 mum, respectively, whereas the ec50s for the
positive control agonists sag and purmorphamine are 0.9 ±

regenerative medicine holds the promise of replacing damaged
tissues largely by stem cell activation. hedgehog signaling through
the plasma membrane receptor smoothened (smo) is an important
process for regulating stem cell proliferation. the development
of hedgehog-related therapies has been impeded by a lack of us
food and drug administration (fda)-approved smo agonists. using
a high-content screen with cells expressing smo receptors and
a beta-arrestin2-gfp reporter, we identiﬁed four fda-approved drugs,
 xxxd2256xxx , ﬂuticasone,  xxxd1719xxx , and ﬂuocinonide, as smo agonists that activate hedgehog signaling. these drugs demonstrated
an ability to bind smo, promote smo internalization, activate gli,
and stimulate the proliferation of primary neuronal precursor cells
alone and synergistically in the presence of  xxxg2067xxx .
 xxxd2256xxx , ﬂuticasone,  xxxd1719xxx , and ﬂuocinonide provide an
unprecedented opportunity to develop unique clinical strategies
to treat hedgehog-dependent illnesses.

10 mum because of the absence of plateaus for the ﬁtted curves
(fig. 1k and table 1). on the basis of our ﬁndings that some
steroids are smo activators, we screened a biased steroid library
from sigma containing 1,658 compounds; however, no additional
hits were identiﬁed. additionally, in a test of speciﬁcity, neither
sag nor the four hits induced betaarr2-gfp aggregation with three
control seven-transmembrane receptors, including the human
vasopressin type 2 receptor ( xxxg231xxx ).

we previously demonstrated that sag induces smo internalization (16). fig. 2 a–d shows that in hek293 cells, 2 mum
sag and 5 mum purmorphamine each stimulate smo-yfp to
internalize. all four primary assay hit compounds similarly induce smo internalization, consistent with their roles as smo
agonists. fig. 2 e–h shows representative results for  xxxd2256xxx

fluorinated glucocorticoid smo agonist drugs activate gli-luciferase
reporter. shh binding to ptc relieves ptc inhibition of smo and

results in activation of the gli transcription factor (18), making gliluciferase reporter assays important indicators of activity downstream of smo. sag was discovered using such a gli reporter assay
(19). in a gli assay performed in shh-light2 cells and using only
the endogenous hedgehog signaling machinery, the four ﬂuorinated steroids activated the gli-luciferase reporter in a dosedependent manner (fig. 4a and table 1). as expected, the negative
control cortisone had no gli activity in shh-light2 cells. in addition, there does not appear to be a non-smo-mediated pathway
that would produce the same type of response (21) (fig. s4).
we also investigated whether shh activity from conditioned
media could be potentiated by the steroid smo agonists in shhlight2 cells. gli-luciferase activity from compound treatment
was measured relative to a dmso control (activity deﬁned as 1).

shh alone at 0.5% produced a 3.8-fold increase in gli response.
we found that gli-luciferase activity attributable to the combination of shh (0.5%) and 5 mum  xxxd2256xxx , ﬂuocinonide,  xxxd1719xxx , or ﬂuticasone was increased compared with shh or
compound treatment alone (fig. 4b). interestingly, the combination of 5 mum sag or purmorphamine plus 0.5% shh did not
result in signiﬁcant activity change compared with either sag or
purmorphamine treatment alone.
 xxxd2256xxx , fluticasone, and  xxxd1719xxx  promote mouse cerebellar
granule cell precursor proliferation. cerebellar granular cell pre-

cursors (gcps) differentiate into distinct types of mature neurons
that comprise the most abundant neurons in the brain (3, 23, 24),
and the expansion in vivo of these granule precursor cells requires
hedgehog/smo pathway signaling (23). we used a mouse gcp
proliferation assay to test the growth-promoting effects of hedgehog agonist compounds. gcps were treated for 48 h with one of the
smo agonists, purmorphamine or sag (positive controls); the lead
compounds  xxxd2256xxx , ﬂuticasone,  xxxd1719xxx , and ﬂuocinonide;
or the negative control compound cortisone. sag had approximately a 2-fold greater efﬁcacy than purmorphamine in promoting
a gcp proliferative response. relative to dmso vehicle, the treatment by  xxxd2256xxx  resulted in a 40–50-fold increase in gcp
proliferation that was similar to the maximal response produced by
purmorphamine (fig. 5a). fluticasone and  xxxd1719xxx  had a 5–6fold stimulatory effect, while ﬂuocinonide or cortisone had no effect
(fig. 5a, inset). experiments repeated in the presence of 5 mum
mifepristone (ru-486), a glucocorticoid nuclear receptor antagonist, gave similar results (fig. s5).

is 3.5 ± 0.8 nm (fig. s3). in competition binding using the same
cell line, we observed that sag completely displaced 5 nm
bodipy-cyclopamine from smo (deﬁned as an efﬁcacy of 1.00),
with an ec50 of 11 ± 0.5 nm (fig. 3 and table 1). as opposed to
cortisone, which is unable to displace bodipy-cyclopamine from
smo up to 10 mum (0 efﬁcacy), the ec50s and efﬁcacy for displacement for  xxxd2256xxx , ﬂuticasone,  xxxd1719xxx , and ﬂuocinonide are, respectively, 78 ± 2.1 nm, 0.24 ± 0.02; 58 ± 1.2 nm,
0.34 ± 0.01; 57 ± 2.6 nm, 0.24 ± 0.02; and 1,000 ± 300 nm, 0.30 ±
0.01 (fig. 3 and table 1). we also observed that the known smo
agonist purmorphamine displaced bodipy-cyclopamine as a weak
inhibitor, as previously described (22), with an ec50 >5 mum, which
is less than that observed for the four steroid agonists.

were normalized to the maximal binding of bodipy-cyclopamine over
baseline. competition curves for each compound were initially analyzed by
linear regression, and those compounds that generated a line with a slope
not signiﬁcantly different from zero (cortisone, p = 0.59; purmorphamine,
p = 0.12; n = 3; alpha = 0.05) were considered not able to compete with bodipycyclopamine for smo binding. the displacement data of the remaining

of 2% shh. results are presented as the mean ± sem from multiple individual experiments (n ≥ 3) performed in triplicate. the statistical signiﬁcance was analyzed by a two-tailed student’s t test, with *p < 0.05 (alpha = 0.05)
deﬁned as signiﬁcant.

using [3h]thymidine incorporation, we further investigated the
relationship between shh and the smo agonists on gcp proliferation. shh (2%) induced a 17-fold increase of gcp proliferation as opposed to the marginal gcp proliferation response
to 5 mum  xxxd2256xxx , ﬂuticasone,  xxxd1719xxx , or ﬂuocinonide; 0.073
mum purmorphamine; or 0.008 mum sag (fig. 5b). treatment of
the gcp cells with 2% shh and an agonist compound resulted in
increased gcp proliferation ranging from 30-fold (ﬂuocinonide)
to 95-fold (sag), indicating strong synergism (fig. 5b). interestingly, the  xxxg1601xxx  (gr) agonist dexamethasone
had a tendency to inhibit the activity of 2% shh (fig. 5b), as
previously described (25). to verify further the opposite effects
that the smo agonists have on proliferation compared to dexamethasone, we treated gcp cells with shh (2% and 20%) and
various concentrations of  xxxd2256xxx  or dexamethasone in the
absence or presence of 2% shh. synergism between 2% shh and
 xxxd2256xxx  was observed in the proliferation assay; such responses were equal to or greater than the stimulatory effects produced
by 20% shh (fig. 5c, left). in comparison, dexamethasone inhibited shh-activated gcp proliferation in a dose-dependent
manner (fig. 5c, right).
it has been reported that hedgehog signaling promotes gcp
proliferation through up-regulation of  xxxg367xxx  and inhibition of
proteasomal degradation of caspase-3, whereas dexamethasone
9326 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0910712107

and several other gr agonists have the opposite effect by
inhibiting gcp proliferation and not inhibiting gcp apoptosis
(25). although all the ﬂuorinated glucocorticoid smoothened
agonists from our study possess the ability, like dexamethasone,
to activate gr as assessed by a gr-gfp nuclear translocation
assay (fig. s6), gcp treatment with shh; purmorphamine; sag;
or ﬂuorinated  xxxd2256xxx ,  xxxd1719xxx , and ﬂuticasone (but not
the weaker smo agonist ﬂuocinonide) increased endogenous
 xxxg367xxx  protein expression and inhibited caspase-3 degradation
(fig. 6). no such growth-enabling responses were observed in
gcps treated with cortisone, dexamethasone, prednisolone, or
corticosterone, observations consistent with recent reports (25–
27) (fig. 6). the opposite response of dexamethasone in the
gcp proliferation assay and its similar response in the nuclear
receptor assay compared to the fgsas suggest that the signal for
the gcp proliferative response is independent of glucocorticoid
nuclear receptor signaling and is most probably attributable directly to activation of smo.
in summary, the drugs  xxxd2256xxx , ﬂuticasone,  xxxd1719xxx , and
ﬂuocinonide function as smo agonists, having an ability to bind
smo, promote smo internalization, activate gli, and synergistically
stimulate the proliferation of primary neuronal precursor cells.
discussion
regenerative medicine is an emerging frontier of medical therapy that holds the promise of curing currently untreatable diseases by harnessing the body’s ability to replace damaged tissues
(28). such therapies might prompt autonomous tissue repair
or facilitate the implantation of engineered tissue derived from
progenitors or stem cells (28, 29). hedgehog activators are
prime candidates for therapeutics to initiate or modulate tissue
self-repair. in this study, we used neuronal precursor/progenitor
cells derived from mouse cerebella and modulated their proliferation using these hedgehog activators. even though the
hedgehog pathway was identiﬁed over two decades ago, there are
still only a few available research compounds that can modulate it,
such as sag and purmorphamine, and, for a variety of reasons,
no clinically available agonist drugs targeted to hedgehog-related
diseases exist.
despite our ﬁndings of fgsas that activate smo, a search of
pubmed indicates they have no apparent association with topical
cancers. one of the four hit fgsas active in the hedgehog assays
was ﬂuticasone. it is reported on the glaxosmithkline drug label
that ﬂuticasone is well tolerated orally and can be administered
i.v. in humans and that its s.c. and oral median lethal doses in mice
and rats are greater than 1,000 mg/kg (30).
glucocorticoids, including the ﬂuorinated glucocorticoids, are
used clinically for the treatment of asthma, inﬂammation, and
skin disease or injury. other glucocorticoids, including dexamethasone, prednisone, cortisone, and corticosterone, are used
to treat premature infants and have been observed to cause
neuronal apoptosis and to inhibit neuronal precursors of the
cerebellar granule neuronal lineage in a mouse model (25, 26).
on the basis that shh exposure cannot overcome the effects of
dexamethasone but can antagonize the effects of hydrocortisone,
heine and rowitch (25) recommend that hydrocortisone be used
as a replacement for dexamethasone in infants because of the
reduced potential for neurotoxicity. we have demonstrated in
vitro that ﬂuticasone and the other ﬂuorinated steroids can be
used to expand neuronal precursor cell populations and potentiate the ability of 2% shh stimulation. our results with fgsas
suggest that some glucocorticoids may even be neuronally protective, but this requires further clinical investigation in this
particular case. for regenerative medicine, we propose that
fsgas could be used immediately orally or i.v. on an acute or
chronic basis for testing in disease models in which an increase in
gli signaling and consequent hedgehog-mediated repair are
desirable, such as neovascularization after myocardial infarctions

fig. 6.  xxxd2256xxx , ﬂuticasone,  xxxd1719xxx , ﬂuocinonide, and other glucocorticoids regulate  xxxg367xxx  expression and caspase-3 degradation in primary neuronal
gcps. primary neuronal gcps derived from 4-day-old mice were individually
treated for 64 h with dmso, 2% shh, 0.625 mum purmorphamine, 0.5 mum sag,
2.5 mum ﬂuticasone, and the remaining compounds at 25 mum. cells were harvested
in sds sample buffer, protein samples were resolved on sds/page gels, and the
corresponding immunoblots were probed by antibodies against  xxxg367xxx , cleaved
caspase-3, and actin (n = 3). a representative immunoblot is shown.
