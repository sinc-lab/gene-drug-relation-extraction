abstract the  xxxg1479xxx  reductase ( xxxg1480xxx )
enzyme restores  xxxg1479xxx  (mtr) enzyme
activity and therefore plays an essential role in homocysteine remethylation. in some studies, the 66a>g polymorphism in the  xxxg1480xxx  gene was associated with increased
neural tube defect (ntd) risk. using a case-control design,
we studied the association between the  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g
polymorphism and spina bifida risk in 121 mothers, 109
spina bifida patients, 292 control women, and 234 pediatric
controls. possible interactions between the  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g
variant and the mtr 2756a>g polymorphism, the  xxxg1475xxx 
677c>t variant, plasma vitamin b12, and plasma methylmalonic acid (mma) levels were examined in the 121
mothers and 292 control women. meta-analyses were
conducted to set the results of the case-control study in
the context of eligible literature on the relation between the
 xxxg1480xxx  66a>g variant and ntd risk. finally, a transmission
disequilibrium test was performed for 82 complete mother–
father–child triads to test for preferential transmission of the
 xxxg1480xxx  risk allele. in our case-control study, the  xxxg1480xxx 
66a>g polymorphism had no influence on spina bifida risk

bifida affected child and the control women. to determine
whether the association between the  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g variant
and spina bifida risk is the result of a genotype effect in the
child, a transmission disequilibrium test (tdt) was
performed. a meta-analysis of eight relevant case-control
studies (including our study) on the association between
the  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g variant and maternal ntd risk and a
meta-analysis of seven eligible case-control studies (including our study) on the relation between the  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g
polymorphism and ntd risk in children were conducted.

introduction

materials and methods

neural tube defects (ntds) are the second most common
congenital malformations after congenital heart defects and
can result in severe disability or even death. despite their
prevalent occurrence, little is known about the etiology of
these birth defects.
since the observation that periconceptional  xxxd2146xxx 
supplementation reduces the occurrence and recurrence risk
of ntds by 50–70% [1–3], much research on ntds has
focused on folate metabolism. 5-methyltetrahydrofolate
(5-methylthf) is the main circulating form of folate in the
blood and can donate its methyl group to homocysteine,
thereby linking the folate cycle to the homocysteine
metabolism. the methyl group of 5-methylthf is transferred to homocysteine via the cofactor  xxxd1771xxx  by the
 xxxg1479xxx  (mtr) enzyme.  xxxd1771xxx  is
readily oxidized to cob(ii)alamin, which inactivates the
cobalamin–mtr–enzyme complex.  xxxg1479xxx 
reductase ( xxxg1480xxx ) restores mtr activity by reductive
methylation of cob(ii)alamin, using s- xxxd3156xxx 
( xxxd3156xxx ) as methyl donor [4, 5].
wilson et al. [6] described a common variant within the
flavin mononucleotide (fmn)-binding domain of the
 xxxg1480xxx  gene, the 66a>g polymorphism, which leads to an
amino acid change of isoleucine to methionine (i22m).
they reported an association between this polymorphism
and increased ntd risk exclusively when vitamin b12
levels were low. later, zhu et al. [7] described an increase
in ntd risk for both mothers and their offspring when
having the  xxxg1480xxx  66ag/gg genotype alone. an effect of
the  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g polymorphism on plasma homocysteine
levels was described by gaughan et al. [8, 9], however, data
are conflicting with other reports [6, 10, 11].
to test whether the  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g polymorphism is a
risk factor for spina bifida, we conducted a case-control
study for both mothers and children. possible interactions
between the  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g polymorphism and low vitamin
b12 status reflected by plasma methylmalonic acid (mma)
levels, the mtr 2756a>g, and the  xxxg1475xxx  677c>t
polymorphism were only studied in the mothers of a spina

study population
the study population was recruited in collaboration with
the bosk and was extended by a group from the pediatric
neurology department of the university medical center
nijmegen. the bosk is a dutch society for patients with
central nervous system defects and their parents and is a
national organization. spina bifida patients recruited from
the university medical center nijmegen represent a
general spina bifida population from the region. the study
group included 109 spina bifida patients (61 girls and 48
boys, mean age 16.4±11.3), their mothers (n=121, mean
age 42.89±10.89), and their fathers (n=103, mean age 44.9±
10.2) [12].
the control group consisted of volunteers recruited from
a general practice in the hague. a total of 2,812
individuals aged 20–90 years were invited to participate
in a health survey of risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
five hundred thirty-two people agreed to participate and in
this study, we only included the 292 women out of this
control group (mean age 50.55±13.47). the individuals are
unrelated and have no history of spina bifida and did not
have a spina bifida affected child [13]. the constitution of
the pediatric control group was as described previously
[14]. briefly, the control group consisted of 234 children
(119 girls and 115 boys, mean age 8.4±6.4). the children of
secondary school age were healthy volunteers and the
younger children were, for ethical reasons, recruited in a
hospital setting. exclusion criteria were overt liver and
renal dysfunction, hormonal therapy, neoplastic disease,
and closure defects such as cleft lip and spina bifida.
informed consent (written or oral) was obtained from all
participants. the local medical ethics committee approved
the study.
laboratory determinations
plasma total homocysteine concentration was measured in
edta plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography

j mol med (2006) 84:1047–1054

(hplc) and fluorescence detection, as previously described
by te poele-pothoff et al. [15].
vitamin b12 levels in plasma were determined using the
dualcount solid phase boil radioassay (diagnostic product,
los angeles, ca, usa).
plasma mma levels were measured using hplc
combined with electrospray ionization tandem mass
spectrometry (lc-esi-ms/ms). the lc-esi-ms/ms system
consists of a quattro lc (waters corporate, milford, ma,
usa) connected to an hp1100 hplc (agilent technologies,
palo alto, ca, usa) and a 232 xl autosampler (gilson,
middleton, wi, usa). one hundred microliters of plasma
together with 100 mul of 0.8 mum stable isotope-labeled-methyld3- xxxd2537xxx  (mma-d3) (cambridge isotope laboratories,
andover, ma, usa) as an internal standard was deproteinized
using ultra filtration. subsequently, an acidified aliquot of the
ultra filtrate was injected onto a waters symmetry column
(2.1×100 mm, 3.5 mum). the mobile phase consisted of 15%
methanol/0.3%  xxxd2154xxx  and is eluted at 200 mul/min.
thereafter, the sample was analyzed by ms/ms monitoring
the carbonyl loss of mma and mma-d3, recording the
transition of m/z 117 to m/z 73 and m/z 120 to m/z 76,
respectively.
the mtr 2756a>g and  xxxg1475xxx  677c>t polymorphisms
had been genotyped using restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis as previously described [16, 17].

200 mum dntps, 2.0 mm mgcl2, 20 mm tris–hcl at
ph 8.2, 50 mm kcl, and 0.5 u taq polymerase (all from
invitrogen, breda, the netherlands).
genomic dna and the  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g hg were
amplified separately. pcr conditions were: initial denaturation at 95°c for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at
95°c, 1 min at 55°c, and 30 s at 72°c, and a final extension
cycle of 7 min at 72°c. amplification products of genomic
dna fragments and hg were mixed 1:1 and denatured for
5 min at 95°c to facilitate subsequent heteroduplex
formation. products were mixed with loading buffer (2.5 g/l
bromphenol blue, 0.36 v/v glycerol 87%, and 10 mm tris at
ph 9.2) and electrophoresed on a 17.5% polyacrylamide gel
(19:1) for 2–3 h at 150 v in 1× tris–borate–edta buffer.
gels were stained with ethidium bromide (1 mg/l) followed
by direct genotyping because the differently sized protruding
loops of the heteroduplexes resulted in a unique migration
pattern for each  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g genotype.
statistical analyses
case-control study

the  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g polymorphism does not lead to a rflp;
therefore, we first used primer-introduced restriction analysis
pcr for  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g genotyping, as previously described
by wilson et al. [6]. however, this method appeared to be
unreliable, resulting in a genotype distribution in the control
group that was not in hardy–weinberg equilibrium. therefore a heteroduplexing method, as described by barbaux et
al. [18], was used to analyze the  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g polymorphism in our study population. a heteroduplex generator
(hg) is a synthetic dna molecule that is identical to the
sequence of a short genomic fragment that includes the
polymorphism of interest, except for a microdeletion close to
the polymorphic site. the hg, for determination of the
 xxxg1480xxx  66a>g mutation, was created by pcr-mediated
site-directed mutagenesis (using the a allele as a template)
and is characterized by a 3-bp microdeletion located 3 bp
downstream of the polymorphic site. the hg was cloned
into the pgem-t easy (promega, fitchburg, wi, usa)
and positive clones were identified by sequence analysis.

odds ratios (ors) and their 95% confidence intervals (ci)
were calculated by means of logistic regression analysis.
ors were not adjusted, except those concerning metabolites, which were adjusted for age.
plasma homocysteine, vitamin b12, and mma concentrations were positively skewed. therefore, these variables
were logarithmically transformed before all statistical
analyses.
the association between the  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g variant and
plasma homocysteine concentration was studied by means
of linear regression analysis. adjustments were made for
age and sex.
to define elevated plasma mma levels, the 80th
percentile of the control distribution was used (0.24 mumol/l).
a decreased level of plasma vitamin b12 was defined as a
concentration below the 20th percentile of the control
distribution (158 pmol/l).
the power of the case-control study was calculated
using the genetic power calculator [19].
all tests were performed using spss software package
version 12.0.1. statistical significance was accepted at a twotailed p<0.05 or a 95% ci of an or that did not include 1.0.

the terms  xxxg1480xxx ,  xxxg1479xxx  reductase; ntd,
neural tube defects; and sb, spina bifida and by handsearching reference lists of original reports, we identified
seven eligible publications on the  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g variant
and maternal ntd risk and seven studies on the  xxxg1480xxx 
66a>g variant and ntd risk in children. one study on the
 xxxg1480xxx  66a>g variant and ntd risk in children only
presented allele frequencies and was therefore excluded
from the meta-analysis [20].
from each study information was extracted on the
genotype frequencies among cases and controls, and ors
(and 95% ci) were calculated based on these genotype
frequencies. the risk of ntds was calculated for the  xxxg1480xxx 
66gg genotype relative to the  xxxg1480xxx  66aa genotype.
because of the relative limited number of reports on the
association between the  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g polymorphism and
ntd risk, studies were not stratified based on their study
design or continent of origin. deviations from hardy–
weinberg equilibrium may cause bias when estimating the
magnitude of the association between the  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g
variant and ntd risk [21], therefore, meta-analyses were
also performed after exclusion of the studies that were not
in hardy–weinberg equilibrium.
transmission disequilibrium test
the relationship between the genotype of the spina bifida
patients and spina bifida risk was assessed by evaluating
the transmission of alleles from heterozygous parents to
their affected offspring using the tdt, a family-based
association test [22]. the power of the tdt was calculated
using the genetic power calculator [19].

in 99 out of 109 spina bifida patients and 213 out of 234
pediatric controls, the  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g genotype could be
determined. the power to detect a twofold increase in spina

relative to the  xxxg1480xxx  66aa/ag genotype (or 0.6, 95% ci

meta-analysis

results
case-control study
the  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g genotype could be determined in 116
out of 121 mothers and in 264 out of 292 control women.
the case-control study had a power of 65% to detect a
twofold increase in maternal spina bifida risk. the genotype
distribution was in hardy–weinberg equilibrium (p=0.62).
the distribution of  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g genotypes in mothers
and controls, and ors for maternal spina bifida risk are
summarized in table 1. the observed  xxxg1480xxx  66g allele
frequency was 0.54 in the controls and 0.65 in mothers with
spina bifida offspring. the  xxxg1480xxx  66gg genotype increased the risk for mothers to have a child with a spina
bifida twofold, compared to the  xxxg1480xxx  66aa genotype
(or 2.1, 95% ci 1.1–3.9) or the  xxxg1480xxx  66ag genotype
(or 2.1, 95% ci 1.3–3.4). because the risk of having a

transmission disequilibrium test
a tdt was used to test for preferential transmission of the
 xxxg1480xxx  risk allele from parents to child. there were 82
complete mother–father–child triads and there were 80
informative heterozygous parents. the power of the tdt to
detect a twofold increase in spina bifida risk was 39%. in
33 out of the 80 informative transmissions (41.25%), the
 xxxg1480xxx  66g allele was given to the child, which resulted in
a nonsignificant chi2td of 2.45 (p=0.12). although the power
of the tdt is low, these results suggest that there is no
preferential transmission of the  xxxg1480xxx  66g allele from
parents to spina bifida affected child.

the  xxxg1480xxx  66aa genotype in mothers

after exclusion of the study with a  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g genotype
distribution that was not in hardy–weinberg equilibrium
[25] the  xxxg1480xxx  66gg genotype was still associated with an
increased risk of having a ntd affected child (or 1.54,
95% ci 1.02–2.34) (data not shown). there might be
some heterogeneity between the results of the studies
(chi2=13.779, p=0.055).
data from seven case-control studies (including our
study) on the  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g variant and ntd risk in
children was obtained. figure 2 demonstrates that the
 xxxg1480xxx  66gg genotype is not associated with ntd risk in
children (or 0.96, 95% ci 0.46–2.01). after exclusion of
those studies with a  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g genotype distribution
that was not in hardy–weinberg equilibrium [25, 28], the
 xxxg1480xxx  66gg genotype was not associated with ntd risk in
children (or 1.35, 95% ci 0.80–2.29) (data not shown).
there might be some heterogeneity between the results of
the studies (chi2=34.912, p=0.000).

vitamin b12 and methylmalonic acid
we examined the possible interaction between the  xxxg1480xxx 
66a>g polymorphism and plasma vitamin b12 levels in
mothers of a spina bifida affected child relative to the
control group. mothers with the  xxxg1480xxx  66gg genotype
combined with low plasma vitamin b12 levels had a
nonsignificant 1.7-fold increased risk of having spina bifida
offspring, compared to mothers with the  xxxg1480xxx  66aa/ag
genotype and normal plasma vitamin b12 levels (or 1.7,
95% ci 0.7–4.0) (data not shown).
because plasma mma is a better indicator of the
intracellular vitamin b12 status than total vitamin b12
levels in plasma, a possible interaction between the  xxxg1480xxx 
66a>g genotypes and plasma mma levels was also
determined. information on both  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g genotype
and plasma mma concentration was present in 113
mothers and 261 control women. table 3 demonstrates that
mothers with the  xxxg1480xxx  66gg genotype in combination
with high plasma mma levels had an approximately
5.5-fold increased risk of having a spina bifida affected child
(or 5.5, 95% ci 2.2–13.5).

mtr 2756a>g genotypes had been determined in 114
mothers and 251 control women [17] and its distribution
was in hardy–weinberg equilibrium (p=0.91). because
individuals with the mtr 2756gg genotype were rare
(1.6% in the control group), mtr 2756gg and 2756ag
individuals were combined. gene–gene interaction between
the  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g variant and the mtr 2756a>g
polymorphism was examined. information on both  xxxg1480xxx 
66a>g genotype and mtr 2756a>g genotype was present
in 110 mothers and 249 control women. mothers with both
the  xxxg1480xxx  66gg genotype and the mtr 2756gg/ag
genotype had a threefold increased risk of having a spina
bifida child, compared to mothers with the  xxxg1480xxx  66aa/ag

in this study, mothers with the  xxxg1480xxx  66gg genotype were
two times more at risk of having a spina bifida affected
child (or 2.1, 95% ci 1.3–3.3). the  xxxg1480xxx  66gg
genotype was not associated with spina bifida risk in
children (or 0.6, 95% ci 0.4–1.1). zhu et al. [7] reported
the  xxxg1480xxx  66ag/gg genotype to be associated with an
increase in ntd risk for both mothers and patients. a
polish study also demonstrated an association between the
 xxxg1480xxx  66gg genotype and ntd risk in mothers and
children; however, this risk was confined to lumbosacral
ntds [23]. in other studies, the  xxxg1480xxx  66gg genotype was
not significantly associated with ntd risk in mothers and

offspring [6, 24–26]. in contrast to the previously discussed
data, relton et al. [27, 28] designated the a allele as risk
factor for ntds. using a tdt, doolin et al. [29] also
reported the a allele to be a risk factor for ntds, only in
mothers.
data in literature on the association between the  xxxg1480xxx 
66a>g variant and ntd risk and the designation of the
 xxxg1480xxx  66a>g risk allele are contradictory and inconclusive.
to assess the relationship between the  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g
polymorphism and ntd risk in both mothers and children,
we conducted a meta-analysis in all eligible case-control
studies. a meta-analysis is an objective technique to review
literature and is a valuable tool to place research findings in
the context of published data. the meta-analysis demonstrated an association between the  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g variant and
maternal ntd risk, increasing the risk by 55% when the
 xxxg1480xxx  66gg genotype is present in mothers. the metaanalyses in children did not show an association between the
 xxxg1480xxx  66gg genotype and ntd risk (or 0.96, 95% ci
0.46–2.01). the results from the meta-analyses support the
data obtained from our case-control studies that the  xxxg1480xxx 
66gg genotype is a ntd risk factor that acts through the
mother.
data from the tdt indicate that there is no preferential
transmission of the  xxxg1480xxx  66g allele from parents to their
spina bifida affected child (p=0.12). even though the tdt
is underpowered, it supports the data found in the casecontrol study that there is no relation between the  xxxg1480xxx 
66a>g variant and spina bifida risk in children.
because of the metabolic interrelation, we studied the
possible interaction between the  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g polymorphism and vitamin b12 status in mothers and control

a possible interaction between the  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g
polymorphism and the  xxxg1475xxx  677c>t variant was also
examined. the  xxxg1475xxx  677c>t polymorphism had been
determined in 114 mothers and in 282 control women [16].
the  xxxg1475xxx  677c>t genotype distribution was in hardy–
weinberg equilibrium (p=0.74). information on both  xxxg1480xxx 
66a>g genotype and  xxxg1475xxx  677c>t genotype was
present in 111 mothers and 264 control women. table 5
demonstrates that mothers with the  xxxg1480xxx  66gg genotype
in combination with the  xxxg1475xxx  677tt genotype were
four times more at risk of having a child with spina bifida,
compared to mothers with the  xxxg1480xxx  66aa/ag genotype
and the  xxxg1475xxx  677cc/ct genotype (or 4.0, 95% ci
1.3–12.5).

women, using plasma vitamin b12 and plasma mma
levels. plasma mma levels were reported to be a sensitive
indicator of intracellular vitamin b12 status. vitamin b12
uptake into the cells is dependent on binding to and
transport by transcobalamin (tc). in plasma, only 20% of
the vitamin b12 present is bound to tc, indicating that
total plasma vitamin b12 concentration is a poor estimate
of the cellular vitamin b12 status. inside the cell vitamin
b12 is required for homocysteine remethylation and for the
conversion of l-methylmalonyl-coa to succinyl-coa by
the vitamin b12 dependent  xxxg1485xxx .
decreased intracellular vitamin b12 levels result in a
decreased conversion of l-methylmalonyl-coa and subsequently elevated mma levels [30, 31]. in this study,
mothers with both the  xxxg1480xxx  66gg genotype and elevated
plasma mma levels were 5.5 times more at risk of having a
spina bifida child (or 5.5, 95% ci 2.2–13.5), which
suggests that the  xxxg1480xxx  66gg genotype is a maternal spina
bifida risk factor, particularly when intracellular vitamin
b12 status is low. this is in line with wilson et al. [6] who
demonstrated an association between the  xxxg1480xxx  66gg
genotype and decreased plasma vitamin b12 levels in
elevating ntd risk.
the  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g polymorphism did not influence
plasma homocysteine levels in our study population. in
contrast, gaughan et al. [8, 9] found a relative risk of 1.59
(95% ci 1.10–2.25) for having homocysteine levels in the
top half of the distribution for  xxxg1480xxx  66gg homozygotes.
other studies however, could not find such an effect of
the  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g polymorphism on homocysteine
concentration [6, 10, 11]. these data indicate that the
influence of the  xxxg1480xxx  66a>g polymorphism on spina bifida
risk acts differently than via altering plasma homocysteine
concentration.
the i22m variant is located in the putative fmn-binding
domain of the  xxxg1480xxx  enzyme that is suggested to interact
with mtr. substitution of an isoleucine by a methionine in
this part of the enzyme could thus disrupt the binding of
 xxxg1480xxx  to the mtr– xxxd1771xxx –complex, thereby decreasing the rate of homocysteine remethylation. not much
is known about the influence of the 66a>g mutation
(i22m) on  xxxg1480xxx  enzyme activity. one study by olteanu et
al. [32] demonstrated that the required molar ratio of
 xxxg1480xxx  to mtr was fourfold higher for maximal activation
for the m22 variant compared to the i22 variant. this
suggests that the i22m variant in the  xxxg1480xxx  enzyme
disrupts the binding of  xxxg1480xxx  and mtr.
when  xxxg1480xxx  function is impaired, it is likely that less
methionine will be formed, leading to decreased  xxxd3156xxx 
formation. decreased formation of  xxxd3156xxx  will subsequently lead to reduced transfer of methyl groups by
 xxxd3156xxx , thereby disturbing the methylation, and thus
expression and function, of genes and proteins, e.g.,

1053

involved in neural tube closure. as early as 1990, coelho
and klein [33] suggested a role for protein methylation in
proper neural tube closure. an additional effect of an
impaired  xxxg1480xxx  enzyme is the reduced conversion of
5-methylthf to tetrahydrofolate, which may subsequently
lead to a decreased availability of folate for purine and
thymidine synthesis. during neurulation, cell proliferation
is extremely fast and dna requirement is subsequently
high. decreased availability of the dna nucleotides could
therefore lead to a disturbed neurulation, resulting in ntds.
data from the case-control studies and meta-analyses in
this study demonstrate that mothers with the  xxxg1480xxx  66gg
genotype are more likely to have spina bifida affected
offspring. in combination with the  xxxg1475xxx  677tt genotype,
the  xxxg1480xxx  66gg genotype increased the risk of having spina
bifida affected offspring even more. we observed a possible
interaction for the  xxxg1480xxx  66gg genotype and high plasma
mma levels, demonstrating the importance of cellular
availability of vitamin b12 for proper neural tube closure.
these observations support the multifactorial etiology of
neural tube closure defects and suggest an important role for
vitamin b12 in the process of neurulation.
