lutamic acid decarboxylase (gad)3 is a major autoantigen in type 1 diabetes and the biosynthetic enzyme
responsible for the production of the inhibitory neurotransmitter ␥-amino butyric acid from  xxxd2431xxx , using pyridoxal 5⬘-phosphate (plp) as a cofactor. abs to  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase (anti-gad) occur in 70 – 80% of subjects with newly
diagnosed type 1 diabetes and predominantly recognize the
smaller, 65-kda isoform,  xxxg850xxx  (1– 4), while autoantibodies to
the 67-kda isoform,  xxxg849xxx , occur in a minority of cases (1).
anti- xxxg850xxx  can be detected up to 10 yr before clinical onset and
has proven to be a useful marker for identifying individuals at risk
of developing type 1 diabetes (5). the pathogenic significance of
the humoral autoimmune response to islet ␤-cell components remains unclear, but in the nonobese diabetic mouse, which spontaneously develops autoimmune diabetes, b lymphocytes contribute as apcs to the progression of islet ␤-cell destruction (6 – 8).
it is uncertain what initiates autoimmune type 1 diabetes. infection with coxsackie b virus (cbv) is suspected due to the coincidence of cbv infection with the disease (9 –11), with one explanation being the activation of autoreactive t lymphocytes by

inflammatory events (bystander activation) (12). however, sequence similarity between a region of  xxxg850xxx  and the p2-c protein of cbv, including a stretch of six identical amino acids
(pevkek) (13), implicates molecular mimicry of  xxxg850xxx . if
mimicry were an initiating event, a major autoantigenic epitope of
 xxxg850xxx  should correspond to the region of similarity shared by
cbv and  xxxg850xxx . this appears to hold for t lymphocyte epitopes
of  xxxg850xxx , because peptides corresponding to the pevkek region from both gad and cbv can bind to the permissive hla
molecule dr3 (14) and can stimulate t lymphocytes from subjects
with newly diagnosed or presymptomatic type 1 diabetes (15).
furthermore, antisera from rabbits immunized with synthetic peptides encompassing the pevkek region of cbv can cross-react
with  xxxg850xxx  by elisa (16). importantly, however, type 1 diabetes-associated autoantibodies to  xxxg850xxx  are not cross-reactive
with cbv (17).
the autoepitopes of  xxxg850xxx  that react with type 1 diabetes sera
are dependent on conformation and reside within aa 244 –570 of
 xxxg850xxx  (18 –22). islet cell mabs (micas), derived from blood
lymphocytes of subjects with type 1 diabetes, react with conformational epitopes of  xxxg850xxx  (20, 21), and these can be divided
into three clusters. these are the mica4 cluster, comprising an
epitope in the middle region (aa 244 – 450); the mica3 cluster,
comprising an epitope formed by the middle and c-terminal regions (aa 244 –585); and a mixed epitope cluster at the c-terminal
region (aa 450 –585) (23). these epitope clusters appear to correspond to epitopes defined serologically by abs to gad in type 1
diabetes. abs to the mica4-type epitope appear first, with later
epitope spreading to the other clusters (23, 24).
techniques currently in use for mapping ab epitopes are inadequate for defining conformational epitopes. we have combined
two technological advances that give information on conformational epitopes despite the lack of structural knowledge about the
ag. the first is the identification of ab-binding peptides through

the major diabetes autoantigen,  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase ( xxxg850xxx ), contains a region of sequence similarity, including six
identical residues pevkek, to the p2c protein of coxsackie b virus, suggesting that cross-reactivity between coxsackie b virus
and  xxxg850xxx  can initiate autoimmune diabetes. we used the human islet cell mabs mica3 and mica4 to identify the ab epitopes
of  xxxg850xxx  by screening phage-displayed random peptide libraries. the identified peptide sequences could be mapped to a homology model of the  xxxd3047xxx  (plp) binding domain of  xxxg850xxx . for mica3, a surface loop containing the sequence
pevkek and two adjacent exposed helixes were identified in the plp binding domain as well as a region of the c terminus of
 xxxg850xxx  that has previously been identified as critical for mica3 binding. to confirm that the loop containing the pevkek
sequence contributes to the mica3 epitope, this loop was deleted by mutagenesis. this reduced binding of mica3 by 70%.
peptide sequences selected using mica4 were rich in basic or hydroxyl-containing amino acids, and the surface of the  xxxg850xxx 
plp-binding domain surrounding lys358, which is known to be critical for mica4 binding, was likewise rich in these amino acids.
also, the two phage most reactive with mica4 encoded the motif valxg, and the reverse of this sequence, lav, was located in
this same region. thus, we have defined the mica3 and mica4 epitopes on  xxxg850xxx  using the combination of phage display,
molecular modeling, and mutagenesis and have provided compelling evidence for the involvement of the pevkek loop in the
mica3 epitope. the journal of immunology, 2000, 165: 3830 –3838.

the screening of phage-displayed random peptide libraries. the
sequence of the ab-binding peptides identifies amino acids critical
for binding. the second is sequence alignment and secondary
structure prediction of plp-dependent decarboxylases and aminotransferases, which have shown that the plp binding domain of
 xxxg1626xxx  (orndc) and aspartate aminotransferase
from bacteria share a protein fold that is common to other plpdependant proteins, including  xxxg850xxx  (25, 26). this has enabled
the derivation of structural models of the gad plp binding domain (27), and such models can be used to formulate specific hypotheses regarding epitope structure. accordingly we screened
phage-displayed random peptide libraries with the  xxxg850xxx -reactive mabs, mica3 and mica4, and mapped the phage peptide
sequences to a homology model of the plp binding domain of
 xxxg850xxx .

materials and methods
phage display

antibodies
mica3 and mica4 were donated by dr. joseph endl (roche, mannheim,
germany). the b lymphocyte lines that secreted these abs were derived
from a patient with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes (20). both abs are of
the igg class, and both are reported to have high avidity for  xxxg850xxx  relative to other  xxxg850xxx -binding micas (29).  xxxg849xxx  and gad6 are mouse
mabs to  xxxg850xxx  (30, 31) and were prepared as described previously (28).

capture elisa
recombinant phage selected by the mabs were tested for reactivity with
the selecting mab using a capture elisa. capture was achieved by coating wells of a 96-well microtiter plate (maxisorp, nunc, naperville, il)
with 100 ␮l of the mab diluted to a concentration of 10 ␮g/ml in sterile
pbs. after the microtiter plate was incubated at 4°c overnight in a humidified chamber, wells were washed and blocked with 200 ␮l/well of 1%
skim milk and 0.05% tween-20 in pbs, ph 7.3 (sm/pbs/twn), for 2 h on
the shaker at room temperature. the blocking solution was removed, and
the plate was washed with 1⫻ tbs/0.05% tween-20. purified phage were
diluted 1/20 in sterile pbs, and 100 ␮l was added to each mab-coated well
and incubated at 4°c overnight in a humidified chamber. wells were
washed with 1⫻ tbs/0.05% tween-20, then blocked again with 200 ␮l/
well of sm/pbs/twn for 1 h on the shaker at room temperature. sheep
anti-m13 abs (100 ␮g/ml; pharmacia biotech, piscataway, nj) were
added to the plate at a concentration of 1/2000 diluted in sm/pbs/twn, to

which was added escherichia coli k91 lysate (32)  xxxd1891xxx  ␮l/ml. igg was
detected using hrp-conjugated anti-sheep/goat ig (silenus, hawthorn,
australia), with 0.5 mg/ml 2,2-azino-di-[3-ethyl-benzthiazoline sulfonate]
(roche) in 0.03 m  xxxd1710xxx , 0.04 m na2hpo4, and 0.003% h2o2, ph 4,
as substrate. phage containing no insert or inserts with stop codons were
used as background controls. phage that gave od readings greater than the
mean ⫹ 3 sd for the background controls were considered to be specifically reactive with the capturing ab.

sequence analysis
the sequences of the peptides selected by each mab that were reactive in
the capture elisa were aligned with each other using the multiple sequence alignment algorithm pileup (33) in conjunction with the tudos
matrix for scoring amino acid substitutions on the basis of physicochemical
properties (34), as previously described (35). peptides that were selected
more than once were included as many times as they occurred. a low
penalty of 1 was applied for the introduction of gaps between aligned
sequences, because the peptides expressed by the phage are near the amino
terminus of the pviii protein and as such are structurally flexible (36, 37).
the low road alignment option was chosen such that sequences were
aligned to the subsequent sequence in the growing guide tree that depicts
the clustering of related peptides. each cluster of similar peptides was then
aligned as a group with the amino acid sequence of human  xxxg850xxx  to
identify regions with amino acid composition similar to that of the peptides. peptides selected using mica3 were also aligned individually with
the sequence of  xxxg850xxx  using clustal w (38).

molecular modeling
the program modeller (39) was used to generate a homology model of
the plp binding region of  xxxg850xxx . the x-ray crystal structure of orndc
(pdb identifier 1ord) (40) and the primary sequence alignment derived by
momany (25) was used as a template for the model. the model was further
refined using the programs charmm (micron separations, san diego,
ca), with dihedral restraints applied where required. examination of a
ramachrandran plot of the final model revealed that all residues were in
allowed conformations.

mutagenesis
the codons for the pevkek loop of  xxxg850xxx , aa 258 –270, were deleted
using a quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (stratagene, la jolla,
ca) and appropriate oligonucleotides to produce the mutant gad⌬258 –270,
which was confirmed by sequencing. the template cdna was a hybrid
construct encoding aa 1–101 of  xxxg849xxx  fused to aa 96 –585 of  xxxg850xxx 
( xxxg849xxx /65), which reacts similarly to  xxxg850xxx  in radioimmunoprecipitation (rip) assays with diabetic sera (41).

rip and inhibition with phagotopes
reactivity with hybrid  xxxg849xxx /65 and with the mutant gad⌬258 –270 was
tested by rip using 35s-labeled rabbit reticulocyte lysate (rrl)-expressed
ag. hybrid  xxxg849xxx /65 encodes aa 1–101 of  xxxg849xxx  fused to aa 96 –585 of
 xxxg850xxx  ( xxxg849xxx /65), and this ag reacts similarly to  xxxg850xxx  in rip assays
with diabetic sera (41). the assay procedure has been described previously
(42). briefly, 40,000 dpm of rrl-expressed  xxxg849xxx /65 or mutant
gad⌬258 –270 per reaction was left with ab overnight at 4°c, after which
the immune complexes were precipitated using protein a-sepharose. the
protein a-sepharose and immune complexes were harvested by centrifugation and washed, and the amount of bound ag was determined by scintillation counting. the rrl-expressed ags were diluted in pbs containing
5% bsa to preserve ag conformation. rip assays were performed using
mica3, mica4, the mouse mab gad6 and  xxxg849xxx , and sera from 45 type
1 diabetes sera. the total amount of ag present in each translation was
assessed by rip using the mouse mab gad6, which binds a continuous
epitope of  xxxg850xxx  located in the c-terminal domain (21).  xxxg849xxx  recognizes a highly conformational epitope that is destroyed by most truncations
and mutations in  xxxg850xxx  and hence was used to evaluate the conformation
of the mutant (21, 43). for rip with the type 1 diabetes sera, 5 ␮l of serum
was tested in a 30-␮l final volume.
the three most reactive phagotopes selected with each mab were used
to inhibit mica3 or mica4 binding to  xxxg849xxx /65 in the rip assay. twenty-five microliters of phagotope suspension was preincubated with 0.4 ng
of mab in a final volume of 35 ␮l at room temperature for 2 h. 35s-labeled
rrl expressed  xxxg849xxx /65 (40,000 dpm; 5 ␮l) was then added, and rip
was performed as previously described. each inhibition was performed in
quadruplicate, and results were compared with the results from inhibition
with a phage containing no insert. the assays were performed twice, with
similar results.

two random nonapeptide phagemid libraries in pc89, in which peptides
were inserted into the amino terminal of the pviii coat protein of bacteriophage f1, were obtained from dr. alessandro luzzago, istituto di richerche biologia molecolare (rome, italy). the libraries contain random
sequences of nine amino acids inserted into the amino terminal of the pviii
coat protein of bacteriophage f1. one library contained cysteine residues
flanking the nine-amino acid insert so that formation of a disulfide bridge
would constrain the conformation of the insert while the other library was
unconstrained. the libraries were screened by biopanning as described
previously (28). briefly, a 1-nm solution of mica3 or 1 ␮m mica4 was
mixed overnight at 4°c with 1 ␮l of each phagemid library (2 ␮l total) in
500 ␮l of pbs, ph 7.3, containing 1 mg/ml bsa (pbs-bsa). phage that
had bound were isolated with paramagnetic beads coated with anti-human
ig (chemicon international, temecula, ca), washed 10 times in pbsbsa, eluted from the magnetic beads with 1 mg/ml bsa, in glycine-hcl,
ph 2.2, and then neutralized with 1 m tris-hcl, ph 9.1. after this first
round of positive selection, there was a negative selection step in which
phage not specifically reactive with the mabs were removed using magnetic beads coated with anti-human ig in the absence of primary ab. following negative selection, the remaining phage were amplified and further
enriched by four additional rounds of positive selection using a 1-nm solution of the mabs with an amplification step between each round. phage
were purified from single colonies after the third and fifth rounds of biopanning and were tested for reactivity with the mabs by capture elisa.
dna inserts were sequenced using the m13– 40 sequencing primer,
[␣-35s] xxxd1148xxx  redivue (amersham international, aylesbury, u.k.), and the
sequenase version 2.0 t7 dna polymerase sequencing kit (u.s. biochemical, cleveland, oh) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. ambiguous sequences were resequenced using the nucleotide analogue ditp in
place of  xxxd1837xxx .

the number of times each sequence was identified is given, and the reactivity of
phagotopes expressing that peptide with mica3, as determined by capture elisa, is
given as an od value measured at 405 nm.

mapping of the mica3 epitope
a model of the three-dimensional structure of the  xxxg850xxx  plpbinding pocket was derived, and a representation of the model is
shown in fig. 2a. the model predicts that the first three regions of
 xxxg850xxx  identified by the sequence alignments for mica3 represent a surface-exposed patch, these being residues 262–270 that
constitute a surface-exposed loop and residues 285–296 and 315–
334 that form surface-exposed ␣-helixes (fig. 2a). these three
regions lie within 25 å of each other in the structure. the fourth
region of alignment, aa 373–394, includes surface-exposed residues but lies more than 30 å distant from the other regions. furthermore, the alignment to aa 373–394 required the introduction of
many gaps into the peptide sequences (fig. 1), suggesting a low
degree of similarity, and all seven of these peptides contained sequence similarities to the group of peptides that aligned with aa
262–270. hence, a contribution of the region of alignment at aa
373–394 to the mica3 epitope was considered unlikely. interestingly, when peptides that aligned to region 4 (but not other peptides) were realigned with  xxxg850xxx  individually using clustal w,
only one of the peptides (hkkslssps) realigned in the same
position. depending on the gap penalty used, each of the other
sequences aligned to region 2, 3, or 5: the sequence srkktftga
realigned to region 2, lrkkgydpg realigned to region 3, and the
sequences mrkansppt (isolated twice) and lsrkktltt realigned, with gaps, to region 5 (residues 511–531). region 5 lies
outside the model of the plp domain, but within a region known
to be important for mica3 binding (see discussion).
the first three sequence alignments, to aa 262–270, 285–296,
and 315–334, identified at least three amino acids in each of these
regions of  xxxg850xxx  that were either identical or physicochemically
similar to the aligned amino acids in the peptides (fig. 1). these
were lys263, lys265, leu270, lys286, lys287, ala291, gly295,
thr296, ala322, and lys323, all of which are surface exposed according to our model. these amino acid residues are proximal to
each other in the model, are similar to amino acids in the mica3
binding peptides, and so may contribute to the conformation-dependent mica3 epitope.
mica4 binding peptides
phage selected after three or five rounds of biopanning were measured for their ability to bind to the selecting ab by capture
elisa. phage that produced an od greater than the mean ⫹ 3 sd
of phage with either no insert or inserts containing stop codons
(od ⫾ sd ⫽ 0.213 ⫾ 0.021) were taken to represent phagotopes
containing peptides that bound the ab. twelve of 14 phage from
the fifth round of positive selection and 14 of 21 phage from the
third round of positive selection reacted by capture elisa. the
inserts contained in 26 phagotopes that expressed peptides reactive
with mica4 were sequenced, and the elisa results and peptide

individual phage selected after three or five rounds of biopanning
were measured for their ability to bind to the selecting ab by
capture elisa. phage that produced an od greater than the
mean ⫹ 3 sd of phage with inserts containing stop codons or no
inserts (od ⫾ sd ⫽ 0.147 ⫾ 0.038) were taken to represent
phagotopes that bound the ab. twenty-eight of 35 phagotopes
from the fifth round of positive selection and 0 of 32 phage from
the third round of positive selection were reactive by capture
elisa. the inserts contained in mica3-binding phagotopes were
sequenced, and the elisa results and the sequences encoded by
their dna inserts are shown in table i. the sequence
qkrakglsa was selected eight times, and seven of these eight
identical phagotopes were among the 12 most reactive by elisa
(range of od values, 0.414 – 0.505). additional sequences,
arkvkgaag, mrkansppt, and yrkkssael, were each
selected twice. twenty-seven of the 28 sequences contained at
least two (4 of 28), but usually three (23 of 28), basic amino acid
residues, with the motifs rk or kr the most common. the proportion of basic amino acids was significantly greater than that
expected to occur in the peptides according to codon frequency
( p ⬍ 0.0001, by ␹2 test), suggesting that basic residues are important for mica3 binding.
inhibition of mica3 binding to  xxxg849xxx /65 was performed using the three most reactive phagotopes selected with mica3,
qkrakglsa, yrkkssael, and mrkansppt, compared
with a phage with no insert. the phagotope encoding the peptide
mrkansppt inhibited mica3 binding to  xxxg849xxx /65 by 11%
( p ⫽ 0.02, by student’s t test), and the phagotopes encoding the
peptides qkrakglsa and yrkkssael showed no significant
inhibition in this assay format.

sequences were then aligned with  xxxg850xxx  to identify regions of
 xxxg850xxx  that contain similar amino acid residues (fig. 1). this
procedure identified five different regions of  xxxg850xxx . these were
residues 262–270 where three peptides aligned, including two with
the sequence yrkkssael; residues 285–296 where five peptides
aligned; residues 315–334 where 11 peptides aligned, including
eight with the sequence qkrakglsa and two with the sequence
arkvkgaag; residues 373–395 where six peptides aligned, including two with the sequence mrkansppt; and residues 511–
541 where three peptides aligned. each of these regions lies within
the minimum region of  xxxg850xxx  required for mica3 binding (residues 244 –570) as determined by deletion analysis (21, 22).

sequences are shown in table ii. the sequence mrkstgtas was
selected twice, and all other phagotopes contained a unique insert.
the two most reactive sequences by capture elisa, qkkmvalsg
and srkvalqgg, shared the motif val-ala-leu-polar-gly.
like the mica3 binding peptides, the mica4 binding peptides
were rich in basic amino acid residues. thirteen of the 26 peptides
contained at least three basic residues, 11 contained two basic residues, and two contained a single basic residue. overall, basic
amino acids constituted 29% of the amino acids in the peptides,
which was significantly greater than expected by chance based on
codon frequency ( p ⬍ 0.0001, by ␹2 test). in addition, serine and
threonine tended to be over-represented, constituting 20% of the
amino acids in the peptides ( p ⫽ 0.076, by ␹2 test).
inhibition of mica4 binding to  xxxg849xxx /65 was tested using the
three most reactive phagotopes selected by biopanning with mica4. the mica4-selected phagotopes encoding the peptides
srkvalqgg and rrklrtnag inhibited mica4 binding to
 xxxg849xxx /65 by 9% ( p ⫽ 0.02, by student’s t test) and 15% ( p ⫽
0.01, by student’s t test), respectively, and the phagotope encoding

of similar peptides. the number of times a peptide was

was selected once. residues present in the peptides that
are identical with amino acids in the region of alignment with  xxxg850xxx  are in bold, and physicochemically
similar amino acids are in italics.

the peptide qkkmvalsg showed no significant inhibition (4%)
in this assay format.
mapping of the mica4 epitope
in contrast to the peptides selected with mica3, the sequence
alignment approach gave no clear result for mica4-selected peptides as individual sequences or pairs of sequences aligned
throughout the  xxxg850xxx  sequence (data not shown). this appeared
to be due to the great diversity of sequences selected with mica4.
however, examination of the sequence of  xxxg850xxx  reveals the sequence leu-leu-ala-val at aa 347–350, which is the reverse of the
motif val-ala-leu contained in the two most reactive mica4 peptides. lys358 has previously been shown to be critical for mica4
binding to  xxxg850xxx  (27), and aa 347–350 are adjacent to this residue (fig. 2b). the mica4 binding peptides were rich in hydroxyl-containing amino acids, and consistent with this is the presence
of ser313, tyr357, and thr335 near lys358. other amino acids in this
region are the hydrophobic phe327 and basic lys356 and arg318.
thus, amino acids most likely to contribute to the mica4 epitope

of the homology model of the plp binding domain of  xxxg850xxx  is shown highlighting the regions to which mica3 binding peptides aligned. residues
262–270, which constitutes the pevkek loop, is colored yellow, residues 285–296 and 315–334 of  xxxg850xxx  are colored red, and residues 373–395 are
colored blue. the red and yellow regions form a 25 å diameter surface patch, which is the usual area occupied by an ab paratope. the blue region (residues
373–395) lies outside this area. the plp-binding lysine 396 is colored pink. b, lys358 and glu321 (yellow) are mostly buried and form a salt bridge. the
 xxxg850xxx  plp binding domain polypeptide chain is represented as a ribbon. residues that may contribute to the mica4 epitope (tyr357, thr335, lys356, arg318,

immunoreactivity of gad⌬258 –270
our prediction that the pevkek loop comprising aa 262–270
forms a central part of the mica3 epitope prompted the testing

of a deletion derivative of  xxxg850xxx  lacking these residues. the
homology model and alignments of  xxxg850xxx  with orndc indicated that aa 258 –270 of  xxxg850xxx  represented a sequence insertion relative to  xxxg1626xxx . assuming conservation of the major fold of the plp binding domain of  xxxg850xxx 
and ornithine decaboxylase, deletion of the pevkek loop
should cause minimal disruption of the conformation of the plp

binding domain. maintenance of conformation was tested by the
ability of the mouse mab,  xxxg849xxx , to bind gad⌬258 –270.  xxxg849xxx 
recognizes a highly conformational epitope of  xxxg850xxx  that has
previously been shown to require the entire protein (21, 43). the
binding of  xxxg849xxx , mica3, and mica4 to gad⌬258 –270 was
measured by rip assay. in each case, dilutions of ab were used
that precipitated 70% of the available  xxxg849xxx /65 ag (fig. 3).
binding of mica3 and mica4 was reduced compared with that
of  xxxg849xxx  by 70 and 40%, respectively.
we determined whether the epitope disrupted by deletion of aa
258 –270 of gad represents a frequent disease-associated epitope
by testing 45 type 1 diabetes sera (fig. 4) along with  xxxg849xxx . because the reactivity of  xxxg849xxx , which recognizes a highly conformational epitope, with the mutant was 54% of that with  xxxg849xxx /
65, this figure was taken as the proportion of mutant gad
molecules that were in a correctly folded conformation in the
gad⌬258 –270 preparation. of the 45 type 1 diabetes sera, 33
(73%) had greater than 54% reduction in reactivity with
gad⌬258 –270 compared with  xxxg849xxx /65, indicating that aa 258 –
270 do contribute to the formation of an epitope recognized by
most type 1 diabetes sera. the 12 that retained ⬎54% reactivity
had relatively high levels of anti-gad, and hence were likely to
contain abs to both linear and conformational epitopes (19).

discussion
ab epitopes are often formed by amino acids that are distant from
each other in the primary sequence of a protein but are brought
together as a reactive site on the surface of the folded molecule.
this is true of  xxxg850xxx , for which the autoantibody epitopes are
highly dependent on conformation (18, 20 –22). consequently, the
utility of truncated molecules in epitope mapping has been limited,
as even small deletions have had considerable impact on the structure of the molecule. the infrequent reactivity with autoantibodies

deletion of residues 258 –270, the pevkek loop of  xxxg850xxx . gray,  xxxg849xxx ;
white, mica3; black, mica4. the mutation was introduced into  xxxg849xxx /
65, a derivative of  xxxg850xxx  that has the first 96 aa replaced with the first 101
aa of  xxxg849xxx  and reacts similarly with diabetic sera and mabs to  xxxg850xxx 
(see materials and methods). results are expressed as the percentage precipitated of the total precipitable ag, as measured using the conformationindependent mouse mab, gad6. six nanograms of mica3 or mica4
were used in the rip assay. at this concentration, binding to the mutant is
reduced relative to the highly conformation dependent ab  xxxg849xxx  by 71%
for mica3 and by 38% for mica4. results are the mean of four replicates, and bars show sds. similar results were obtained in three independent experiments.

of the closely related isoform,  xxxg849xxx , has prompted the use of
hybrids of  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx  or swapping of individual amino
acids that differ between the isoforms (27, 44). while more informative, these approaches are also limited because amino acids important for epitope formation that are shared by the isoforms will
not be detected. in the study by schwartz et al. (27) the different
reactivities of  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx  with various monoclonal autoantibodies could not readily be explained by single amino acid
differences. rather, a difference in conformation of the gad isoforms appears to be responsible for the particular autoantigenicity
of  xxxg850xxx .
ab screening of random peptide libraries overcomes the limitations of epitope mapping with truncated molecules and swap
mutants. in the present study we have identified phagotopes that
bind to mabs derived from a subject with type 1 diabetes, mica3
and mica4, and have shown that several of the most reactive
phagotopes inhibit reactivity with gad in rip assays. analysis of
the sequences of phage-displayed peptides that bound to mica3
and mica4 identified several short regions of sequence identity
with the  xxxg850xxx  amino acid sequence, and a model of the plp
binding domain of gad was used to locate these regions on the
surface of the gad molecule.
for mica3-selected phagotopes, the regions of sequence
identity with the gad plp binding domain were located on a
surface-exposed loop and in two helixes that form a hydrophilic
patch on the surface of the folded protein. the existence of this
presumptive epitope is consistent with studies using truncated
 xxxg850xxx  molecules, which showed that aa 245–570 bind mica3, but aa 295–570, which lacks the pevkek loop, do not
(21). we have demonstrated that deletion of aa 258 –270 of
gad greatly reduces mica3 binding. one explanation for this
may be that the pevkek loop is essential for correct folding of
the plp domain, and we have observed that deletion of the

gates mica4 binding to  xxxg850xxx . the mica4 binding peptides
that we derived by phage display indicated that in addition to basic
residues, hydroxyl groups and hydrophobic amino acids were important for mica4 binding. examination of the homology model
of the plp binding domain identifies ser313, tyr357, thr335,
lys356, and arg318 near lys358, so that the side chains of these
residues may interact with the paratope of mica4. furthermore,
the sequence leu347, leu348, ala349, and val350, which was
present in reverse in the two peptides most reactive with mica4,
is also near lys358. because there were two mutants derived by
schwartz et al., (27), ser313 to ala and leu348 to gln, that did not
affect mica4 binding, these residues could be excluded as potential contributors to mica4 binding. hence, as for the mica3
epitope, residues common to both gad isoforms appear to contribute to the mica4 epitope. thus, the surface patch formed by
residues arg318, thr335, leu347, ala349, val350, lys356, and tyr357
could constitute the mica4 epitope.
the observation that substitution of lys358 for asn abrogates
mica4 binding to  xxxg850xxx  (27) may suggest that there is a direct
interaction between lys358 and the paratope of mica4. however,
our model of the  xxxg850xxx  plp binding domain (fig. 2b) predicts
that lys358 is buried and, therefore, inaccessible to ab. rather, we
predict that lys358 forms a salt bridge with glu321 such that substitution of lys358 would disrupt this salt bridge and cause a local
conformational disruption and loss of ab binding, thus accounting
for the earlier observations (27). the possible existence of a salt
bridge between lys358 and glu321 is intriguing in view of the fact
that  xxxg849xxx  has asn in place of lys358, which would be unable to
form the salt bridge with glu321.  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx  have quite
different affinities for plp and different binding to monoclonal
autoantibodies (1– 4), consistent with significant conformational
differences between the isoforms. while caution must be used in
interpreting the model of the molecular structure of the  xxxg850xxx 
plp binding domain, the contribution of a salt bridge between
lys358 and glu321 to the conformational differences between the
gad isoforms warrants further investigation.
autoantibodies to  xxxg850xxx  appear very early in the preclinical
phase of type 1 diabetes, and b lymphocytes are seen as an
important component in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes by
reason of their ability to efficiently present ag to t lymphocytes
(46). if cbv infection with subsequent cross-reaction with
 xxxg850xxx  were indeed the cause of insulitis, then the major
autoantibody epitope of  xxxg850xxx  would logically be in the
pevkek region where there is sequence similarity between
gad and the p2c protein of cbv. however, autoantibodies to
 xxxg850xxx  do not cross-react with cbv (17). our molecular model

pevkek loop causes conformational instability of the protein
(data not shown). however, the binding of a highly conformation-dependent mab,  xxxg849xxx , was reduced to a lesser degree
than the binding of mica3, indicating that conformation was
mostly maintained under our particular assay conditions.
hence, the interpretation is that the pevkek loop region is
necessary for the complete formation of the epitope recognized
by mica3. testing of type 1 diabetic sera suggests that the
pevkek loop forms an important element of a common type 1
diabetes-associated epitope of  xxxg850xxx . given the abundance of
basic amino acid residues in peptides selected with mica3, we
propose that lys263 and/or lys265 in the pevkek loop may be
directly involved in binding of mica3 to  xxxg850xxx .
the alignment of the phage peptide inserts with  xxxg850xxx  indicated that a region of the c terminus may also be important
for binding of mica3, because a group of mica3 binding
peptides aligned with amino acids between residues 511 and
531 of  xxxg850xxx . the c-terminal domain of  xxxg850xxx  is known to
be essential for the  xxxg850xxx  specificity of mica3 binding, as
swapping aa 511–585 with those of  xxxg849xxx  eliminates mica3
binding (27). a recent study delineated this region more precisely and found that aa 513–527 of  xxxg850xxx  were necessary for
mica3 binding (44), consistent with our alignment of mica3selected peptides with aa 511–531. this region of  xxxg850xxx  contains nine differences between  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx , including
three (thr515, leu516, and ser527) that were identical or physicochemically conserved in the aligned peptide sequences (fig.
1). it is noteworthy that in the orndc dimer, the c-terminal
domain of one subunit wraps around the partner subunit, bringing part of a c-terminal domain near to the partner subunit plp
binding domain (fig. 2d). we have previously found that a
dimeric configuration of  xxxg850xxx  appears to favor the binding of
diabetes-associated autoantibodies (45). thus, we propose that
the entire mica3 epitope consists of two structural components, one on the surface of the plp binding domain and the
other in the c-terminal domain between aa 511 and 531. by
analogy with orndc, the c-terminal domain of  xxxg850xxx  would
wrap around the plp binding domain of the partner subunit
proximal to the pevkek loop 262–270 and ␣-helixes 284 –296
and 315–334 so that in the quaternary structure of the  xxxg850xxx 
dimer the two structural components of the mica3 conformational epitope are brought together. knowledge of the threedimensional structure of dimers of  xxxg850xxx  derived from x-ray
crystallography will be necessary to test this prediction.
in regard to the mica4 epitope, a previous study (27) has identified a single amino acid substitution, lys358 to asn, that abro-

of the plp binding domain of  xxxg850xxx  predicts that the
pevkek region forms a large surface-exposed loop that should
be readily accessible to ab, and mutagenic deletion of this loop
confirmed that it contributes to the mica3 epitope. however,
other regions of  xxxg850xxx , including the c-terminal domain, are
also required for formation of the complete epitope. thus, the
nonreactivity of mica3 with the p2c protein of cbv is
explained by the different structural context of the pevkek
region in the p2c protein compared with that of  xxxg850xxx . this
along with the involvement of surrounding elements on the
surface of  xxxg850xxx  appear to be necessary for optimal binding of
mica3 to  xxxg850xxx .
in conclusion, screening of phage-displayed random peptide libraries with human mabs to  xxxg850xxx , mica3, and mica4 yielded
peptide sequences that mimic the conformational epitopes of
 xxxg850xxx . alignment of these sequences together with molecular
modeling and mutagenesis implicate the participation of the
pevkek loop in the conformational mica3 epitope and support earlier studies suggesting that aa 511–531 of  xxxg850xxx  contribute to this epitope. the phage display approach has also
further revealed the structure of the mica4 epitope. our procedures illustrate novel approaches to the structural characterization of conformational ab epitopes reactive with autoimmune disease abs.
