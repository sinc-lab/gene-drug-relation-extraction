purpose: two members of the  xxxg682xxx  family, egfr and her2, have been implicated
in radioresistance in breast cancer and other malignancies. to gauge the potential clinical utility of targeting both
egfr and her2 to control growth and radiosensitize human breast cancers, we examined the effect of a dual
egfr/her2 inhibitor,  xxxd2445xxx , on the proliferation and radiation response of either egfr- or her2overexpressing human breast cancer cell lines.
methods and materials: primary human breast cancer cell lines that endogenously overexpress egfr or her2
and luminal mammary epithelial h16n2 cells stably transfected with her2 were evaluated for the effect of
 xxxd2445xxx  on inhibition of ligand-induced or constitutive receptor phosphorylation, proliferation, radiosensitization, and inhibition of downstream signaling.
results:  xxxd2445xxx  inhibited constitutive and/or ligand-induced egfr or her2 tyrosine phosphorylation of all
five cell lines, which correlated with the antiproliferative response in all but one cell line.  xxxd2445xxx  radiosensitized egfr-overexpressing cell lines, but her2-overexpressing cells were unable to form colonies after brief
exposure to  xxxd2445xxx  even in the absence of radiation, and thus could not be evaluated for radiosensitization.
one cell line was resistant to the antiproliferative and radiosensitizing effects of  xxxd2445xxx , despite receptor
inhibition. exploration of potential mechanisms of resistance in sum185 cells revealed failure of  xxxd2445xxx  to
inhibit downstream erk and akt activation, despite inhibition of her2 phosphorylation. in contrast, sensitive
her2-overexpressing cell lines demonstrated inhibition of both erk and akt phosphorylation.
conclusion:  xxxd2445xxx  potently inhibits receptor phosphorylation in either egfr- or her2-overexpressing cell
lines and has both antiproliferative and radiosensitizing effects. resistance to  xxxd2445xxx  was not due to a lack
of receptor inhibition, but rather with a lack of inhibition of erk and akt, suggesting that measurement of
inhibition of crucial signaling pathways may better predict response than inhibition of receptor phosphorylation.

introduction

nosis in an array of tumor types, including central nervous
system, head and neck, gi, and breast cancer (4). in addition
to, or perhaps because of, their stimulation of proliferation
and survival, egfr family members activate signal transduction pathways that influence response to cytotoxic agents
(5). both egfr and her2 overexpression have been associated with resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (rt). likewise, inhibition of egfr or her2 by a
variety of agents can enhance chemotherapy and rt in preclinical models, and early-stage clinical trials of egfr family
inhibitors have shown promise (6 –9).

the  xxxg682xxx  (egfr) family consists of four  xxxg1608xxx  tyrosine kinases,
egfr ( xxxg682xxx ), her2 (erbb2, neu),  xxxg722xxx  ( xxxg722xxx ), and
 xxxg723xxx  ( xxxg723xxx ), whose function is to transmit extracellular
cues to intracellular signal transduction pathways that regulate proliferation, survival, and differentiation responses
(1–3). at least two members of the family, egfr and
her2, are frequently dysregulated in human epithelial tumors, via autocrine stimulation, overexpression, or mutation; dysregulation is often associated with an adverse progreprint requests to: carolyn i. sartor, m.d., department of

radiosensitization by  xxxd2445xxx 

a her2 inhibitor, herceptin, is an effective therapeutic
agent for breast tumors that exhibit her2 gene amplification, and has radiosensitized her2 overexpressing breast
cancer cell lines in preclinical models (10). we have an
ongoing clinical trial investigating the safety and efficacy of
herceptin radiosensitization for patients with locally advanced breast cancer but also wished to develop radiosensitization approaches for patients whose tumors do not
exhibit her2 gene amplification. we hypothesized that an
inhibitor that could target either egfr or her2 would be
an effective therapeutic agent for a wider array of breast
cancers.
 xxxd2445xxx  is a reversible inhibitor of the  xxxg2198xxx 
activity of both egfr and her2 (11, 12). it has antiproliferative activity in a wide range of human tumor cell lines
and xenografts that overexpress egfr or her2. phase i
clinical trials are ongoing in cancer patients to determine
both the maximally tolerated dose (egf10003) and the dose
at which receptor phosphorylation is inhibited, the biologically effective dose (egf10004). thus, we chose to investigate in greater detail the antiproliferative and radiosensitizing efficacy of  xxxd2445xxx  in a panel of human breast
cancer cell lines that have been well-characterized with
regard to their egfr/her2 phenotypes.
methods and materials
materials, growth factors, and reagents
gw572106 was provided by glaxosmithkline as a
10-mm concentrated stock solution in  xxxd1896xxx 
(dmso). serial dilutions were performed with dmso to
the desired concentration. all tissue culture reagents were
obtained from sigma chemical (st. louis, mo), except for
fetal bovine serum and insulin, which were obtained from
invitrogen life technologies (carlsbad, ca). egf was also
obtained from invitrogen life technologies (carlsbad,
ca), and heregulin b1 was a kind gift from genentech
(south san francisco, ca).
cell lines, tissue culture
sum149, sum102, sum225, and sum185 were derived from primary human breast cancers h16n2-her2
cells were created as previously described (13). all cell
lines were a kind gift from dr. s. ethier and colleagues;
complete details regarding the characteristics of these cell
lines may be found at http://www.cancer.med.umich.edu/
breast_cell/clines/clines.html. cell were grown in serumfree, growth factor-defined media or in media containing
5% fetal bovine serum with supplemental growth factors in
a humidified incubator at 37°c containing 10% carbon
dioxide, as previously described (14, 15).
immunoprecipitation and western blots
cells in log-phase growth were starved in growth-factor
deplete, serum-free media for 24 h and then treated with
serial dilutions of  xxxd2445xxx  or vehicle control (dmso)
for 1 h before cell lysis. cells were stimulated with ligand

(egf, 10 ng/ml), or heregulin b1, 10 ng/ml) 15 min before
cell lysis. immunoprecipitation and western blotting to
detect phosphorylated egfr or her2 were performed as
previously described (16). in brief, cells were lysed in
normal lysis buffer containing 20 mm hepes (ph 7.3), 50
mm sodium fluoride, 10% glycerol, 1% triton x-100, 5
mm edta, and 0.5m nacl, supplemented with 1 mm of
sodium orthovanadate, 6 ␮g/ml of aprotinin, and 10 ␮g/ml
of leupeptin, and insoluble fractions were removed by centrifugation. the protein concentration was measured (biorad, hercules, ca) and 1 mg of total protein immunoprecipitated with anti-egfr antibody (ab22, polyclonal rabbit
anti-sera raised against recombinant  xxxg1073xxx  fusion protein containing the c-terminal 100 amino
acids of egfr) or anti-her2 antibody (ab-1, neomarkers,
union city, ca). immunoprecipitates were separated on
8%  xxxd3215xxx  (sds)/poly-acrylamide gels
and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinyl difluoride
(pvdf), blocked, and probed with anti-phospho-tyrosine
rc20 (bd transduction laboratories, lexington, ky) to
detect phosphorylated receptor or anti-egfr (ab22) or
anti-her2 (21n, neomarkers) to determine the receptor
levels. to determine erk and akt phoshphorylation and
levels, lysates were prepared as described above, and 10 ␮g
of protein separated on 12% sds/polyacrylamide gels,
transferred to pvdf, blocked, and probed with anti-phospho-erk, anti-erk, anti-phospho akt, or anti-akt (cell
signaling technology, beverly, ma). detection was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence (amersham, uk).
for all primary antibodies, the secondary antibody used was
horseradish peroxidase– conjugated anti-rabbit igg (cell
signaling technology) diluted 1:30,000 in tris-buffered
saline (tbs)/t plus 5% nonfat milk.
proliferation assays
cells were plated into 6-well plates at a density to ensure
nonconfluence during the course of 1 week (5 ⫻ 104 cells/
well for sum102, sum149, and h16n2-her2 cells, 1 ⫻
105 for sum185 cells, and 5 ⫻ 105 for sum225 cells) and
grown in full-growth media with or without increasing
concentrations of  xxxd2445xxx  for three media changes (6 –7
days). cells were trypsinized and counted by a hemocytometer.
colony-forming assays
cells were plated at low density and treated for 1 h with
 xxxd2445xxx  or dmso alone (control), irradiated or shamirradiated with graded, single doses from a 60co theratron
irradiator (atomic energy of canada) at a dose rate of 85
cgy/min or from a 137cs irradiator at a dose rate of 158
cgy/min. in all conditions, the culture medium was changed
10 min after ionizing radiation to complete medium without
inhibitor. after 2– 4 weeks of incubation, the samples were
fixed in methanol/acetic acid (3:1 vol/vol) and stained in 1%
crystal violet, and the number of viable colonies (defined as
those colonies containing ⱖ 25 cells) per dish was counted.

results
 xxxd2445xxx  is a small molecule  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor
that selectively inhibits egfr family kinases. it has been
shown to be equally effective at inhibiting the baculovirusexpressed kinase domain of both egfr and her2 in biochemical assays, but is 10-fold less potent in inhibiting
 xxxg723xxx  activity (11).  xxxd2445xxx  has antiproliferative activity in a wide variety of tumor cell lines and xenografts (11,
12). to explore the therapeutic utility of  xxxd2445xxx  in
breast cancer, we investigated its effects on egfr- or
her2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines in greater
detail, using well-characterized cell lines that have not been
previously evaluated for response to  xxxd2445xxx .
receptor inhibition and antiproliferative and
radiosensitizing effects of  xxxd2445xxx  on egfroverexpressing breast cancer cells
to study the effect of  xxxd2445xxx  on egfr-overexpressing breast cancer, we chose two cell lines derived from
primary human breast cancers. sum102 cells express
roughly 150,000 cell-surface egfrs and are dependent on
egfr activation for proliferation (15). sum149 cells have

a comparable level of egfr expression as measured by
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (16). with regard to
the expression of other egfr family members, both cell
lines express normal amounts of her2, but only sum149
cells also express  xxxg722xxx , and neither expresses  xxxg723xxx .
we first evaluated the effect of  xxxd2445xxx  on inhibition
of ligand-induced egfr activation by measuring receptor
tyrosine phosphorylation after a 1-h exposure of increasing
concentrations of  xxxd2445xxx . a 1 ␮m concentration of
 xxxd2445xxx  inhibited ligand-induced phosphorylation of
egfr in both cell lines (fig. 1). after a sharp decline in the
level of phosphorylation by 1 ␮m  xxxd2445xxx , a low level
of residual activation remained unchanged, despite increasing inhibitor concentration.
we next measured the antiproliferative effect of
 xxxd2445xxx  on cells growing in complete medium. cells
were grown in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of  xxxd2445xxx  for 1 week (three media changes).
 xxxd2445xxx  inhibited, in a dose-dependent fashion, the proliferation of both egfr-driven cell lines (fig. 2). the
antiproliferative effect was seen at doses of  xxxd2445xxx  that
inhibited egfr phosphorylation.
dysregulation of egfr has been implicated in radioresistance, and several egfr inhibitors have been shown
to sensitize tumor cells to ionizing radiation. to explore
the effect of  xxxd2445xxx  on the radiation response of
sum102 or sum149 cells, radiation clonogenic survival
assays were performed with or without a 1-h exposure of
 xxxd2445xxx  before and during rt. the inhibitor was
removed after rt so the antiproliferative activity of
 xxxd2445xxx  would not confound the radiation response
interpretation. the brief exposure to  xxxd2445xxx  did not
influence the ability of sum102 cells to form colonies in
the absence of radiation; the plating efficiency was equivalent in sham-irradiated cells with or without  xxxd2445xxx 
treatment (data not shown). there was a modest effect on
sum149 cells, with about a 10% decrease in colony
formation in  xxxd2445xxx -treated cells in the absence of
radiation.  xxxd2445xxx  modestly sensitized both cell lines
at doses that inhibited egfr phosphorylation and proliferation (fig. 3).

receptor inhibition and antiproliferative and
radiosensitizing effects of  xxxd2445xxx  in her2overexpressing breast cancer cells
we next investigated the effect of  xxxd2445xxx  on her2overexpressing cells. we chose two cell lines derived from
primary human breast cancers that overexpress her2,
sum185 and sum225. sum225 cells have constitutive
activation of her2 and overexpress her2 at levels consistent with gene amplification. sum185 cells overexpress
her2 at more modest levels and do not demonstrate constitutive her2 activation. with regard to expression of
other egfr family members, both cell lines express normal
levels of egfr and  xxxg723xxx , and sum185 overexpresses

 xxxg722xxx  as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (16).
inhibition of ligand-induced her2 tyrosine phosphorylation by  xxxd2445xxx  was measured in sum185 cells, as
was inhibition of constitutive her2 tyrosine phosphorylation in sum225 cells. receptor phosphorylation was decreased in both cell lines by 1 ␮m of  xxxd2445xxx  (fig. 4).
next, the antiproliferative effect of  xxxd2445xxx  on these
her2-overexpressing cells was evaluated.  xxxd2445xxx 
clearly inhibited the proliferation of sum225 cells. however, sum185 cell proliferation was not affected by
 xxxd2445xxx , despite evidence of inhibition of receptor activation (fig. 5).

to adhere for 24 h. one hour before rt, cells were exposed to 5 ␮m of  xxxd2445xxx  or dmso (control) and irradiated
with single, graded doses. after rt, media were replaced with fresh media that did not contain inhibitor. colonies of
ⱖ25 cells were counted approximately 2 weeks after treatment and clonogenic survival curves generated.  xxxd2445xxx 
modestly sensitized both (a) sum102 and (b) sum149 cells to ionizing radiation.

fig. 4. inhibition of her2 phosphorylation by  xxxd2445xxx  in her2-overexpressing cells. cells were treated with 1–10
␮m of  xxxd2445xxx  for 1 h, and stimulated, or not, with ligand for 15 min for sum185 cells (sum225 have constitutive
her2 phosphorylation), immunopreciptated with anti-her2, electrophoresed, and blotted with anti- xxxd1075xxx  or
anti-her2.  xxxd2445xxx  inhibited constitutive her2 phosphorylation in (a) sum225 cells and (b) ligand-induced
phosphorylation in sum185 cells.

because we obtained disparate results with the two
her2-overexpressing cell lines, we investigated another
her2-overexpressing cell line to determine whether her2
inhibition by  xxxd2445xxx  correlated with an antiproliferative response. h16n2-her2 cells are immortalized luminal
mammary epithelial cells that stably overexpress exogenous
her2 via retroviral infection (13). her2 overexpression
induces constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of her2, as
well as ligand-independent activation of the other egfr
family members, presumably by heterodimerization with
overexpressed her2. the constitutive egfr and her2
activation was inhibited by  xxxd2445xxx  (fig. 6a). like the
her2 overexpressing sum225 cells, h16n2-her2 cells
were sensitive to  xxxd2445xxx  inhibition of proliferation
(fig. 6b). thus, her2 overexpression alone was sufficient
to confer  xxxd2445xxx  sensitivity, indicating that her2overexpressing cells are responsive to  xxxd2445xxx .
to determine whether  xxxd2445xxx  would radiosensitize
her2-overexpressing cells, we performed clonogenic survival assays using sum225, sum185, and h16n2-her2
cells treated with or without a 1-h exposure to 1–5 ␮m of
 xxxd2445xxx . the brief exposure of sum225 cells to
 xxxd2445xxx  at doses as low as 0.1 ␮m completely abrogated

the ability of sum225 cells to form colonies, even in the
absence of rt (fig. 7). this was not due to the inability of
sum225 cells to form colonies; we were able to generate
clonogenic survival curves from sum225 cells that were
treated with radiation in the absence of inhibitor. the
h16n2-her2 cells responded similarly to sum225 cells,
with a lack of colony formation after brief exposure to
 xxxd2445xxx  (fig. 7). in stark contrast, sum185 cells, which
demonstrated no antiproliferative response to  xxxd2445xxx 
despite receptor inhibition, demonstrated no radiation response modulation by  xxxd2445xxx  (fig. 7).
effect of  xxxd2445xxx  on inhibition of downstream signal
transduction in egfr- or her2-overexpressing breast
cancer cell lines
because sum185 cells were resistant to  xxxd2445xxx  despite inhibition of her2 phosphorylation, we hypothesized
that the lack of a response of sum185 cells was due to
differences in the effect (or lack thereof) of  xxxd2445xxx  on
downstream signaling. therefore, we investigated the inhibition of two primary egfr family receptor signaling pathways implicated in antiproliferative, survival, and radiation
responses, the ras-mapk and the pi3k-akt pathways.
treatment of sum225 for 30 min with  xxxd2445xxx  at doses
that inhibited her2 phosphorylation inhibited constitutive
and ligand-induced erk and akt phosphorylation in the
sum225 cells (fig. 8). in constrast, in the sum185 cells,
 xxxd2445xxx  did not inhibit either erk or akt phosphorylation, despite her2 inhibition (fig. 8). thus, resistance to
 xxxd2445xxx  correlated with a lack of inhibition of downstream signaling as opposed to a lack of receptor inhibition.

egfr family members present an attractive target for
therapeutic manipulation, because they are frequently involved in the pathogenesis of human epithelial tumors; and
a diverse array of inhibitors of egfr family members are
available (4). although these primarily cytostatic agents

apy, they may have more substantial effects when combined
with conventional cytotoxic therapies, such as chemotherapy or rt. a growing body of data indicate that both egfr

and her2 are involved in cellular and tissue responses to
radiation, and overexpression/dysregulation of either has
been associated with radioresistance (5). radiosensitization

not form colonies after the brief  xxxd2445xxx  exposure.

fig. 8. lack of response of sum 185 cells correlated with lack of inhibition of downstream signaling. cells were treated
with  xxxd2445xxx  for 1 h followed by ligand stimulation for 15 min. phosphorylation of  xxxd1355xxx /42 mapk or akt was
measured by immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies. both  xxxd1355xxx /42 mapk and akt constitutive and ligandinduced phosphorylation were inhibited in (a) sum225 cells, but neither  xxxd1355xxx /42 mapk or akt phosphorylation was
inhibited in (b) sum185 cells.

by inhibition of egfr by  xxxd467xxx  (imclone) or iressa
( xxxd2186xxx , astra zeneca), her2 by herceptin (traztuzumab, genentech), and all four family members by ci1033 (pfizer) has been demonstrated in preclinical studies,
and clinical trials to evaluate toxicity and efficacy of radiosensitzation are underway (17–24).
both of the egfr-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines
we tested were radiosensitized by  xxxd2445xxx , as determined by single-fraction in vitro assays. however, we were
consistently unable to measure radiosensitization by
 xxxd2445xxx  of her2-overexpressing cells using in vitro
assays because of the extreme sensitivity of these cells to
the inhibitor even without rt. to better evaluate the effect
on her2-overexpressing cells, we are studying the radiation response in vivo, using sum225, sum185, and
h16n2-her2 xenografts. studies using other egfr inhibitors have demonstrated that radiosensitization is significantly more pronounced in vivo than in vitro, and with
multiple fractions than with single fractions (19 –23). thus,
our other ongoing in vivo multifractionation studies of
 xxxd2445xxx  radiosensitization of sum149 and sum102
xenografts may demonstrate even greater sensitization. the
results of our preclinical studies have suggested that
 xxxd2445xxx  may be an effective radiosensitizer for breast
cancers whose pathogenesis is driven by either egfr or
her2 dysregulation.
to optimize the clinical use of egfr family inhibitors,
several questions must be answered. despite intense preclinical and clinical investigation of egfr family inhibitors, considerable uncertainty still exists regarding the appropriate selection of tumors for egfr-targeted therapeutic

approaches. unlike the ability of the her2 expression level
to predict the herceptin response, egfr expression levels
did not correlate well with the response to egfr kinase
inhibitors, perhaps because egfr expression and activation
did not correlate with, nor necessarily indicate, tumor dependence on egfr for pathologic proliferation (25, 26).
measurement of constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating the presence of inappropriately activated receptors,
may better identify tumors that will respond to perturbation
of egfr activity. however, our results suggest that overt,
measurable constitutive receptor activation is not a prerequisite for  xxxd2445xxx  response in egfr-overexpressing
breast cancer cell lines, because neither sum102 nor
sum149 demonstrated significant constitutive egfr phosphorylation but were still sensitized by  xxxd2445xxx . our
data raise the possibility that confining the use of
 xxxd2445xxx  to cases demonstrating constitutive receptor
phosphorylation may be too restrictive.
another conundrum is that the clinical responses seen to
date were more modest than predicted by preclinical models
(27). because most preclinical work with egfr family
inhibitors has been restricted to a few, highly responsive cell
lines, there is a need to identify cell lines to serve as models
to study mechanisms of resistance. the sum185 cells represent an interesting example of  xxxd2445xxx  resistance, and
illustrate that, as with the receptor profile, receptor inhibition may not be the best indicator of response. although
sum185 cells overexpress her2, which is inhibited in
vitro by  xxxd2445xxx , they are not growth inhibited or radiosensitized by  xxxd2445xxx . we hypothesize that the
pathologic proliferation signals driving these cells result

radiosensitization by  xxxd2445xxx 

from other, her2-independent aberrations, such as activating ras mutations or dysregulated signaling of insulin-like
growth factor-1 receptors, either of which could induce
constitutive activation of erk and akt despite inhibition of
her2. alternately, complex interactions among the four
egfr family members may influence the response to
egfr inhibitors. egfr:her2 heterodimers have been implicated in the response and lack of response to iressa and
su11925 (28, 29). the response to the  xxxd1256xxx 
cgp59326 is affected by heregulin-induced her2: xxxg722xxx 
heterodimerization, and inhibition of a dual inhibitor,
pki166, is not (30).  xxxd2445xxx  does not inhibit phosphorylation of  xxxg722xxx  or  xxxg723xxx  in sum185 cells, indicating that
 xxxg722xxx : xxxg723xxx  heterodimers or  xxxg723xxx : xxxg723xxx  homodimers
may be responsible for the refractory activation of erks
and akt (earp et al., manuscript in preparation). however,
 xxxg722xxx  does not appear relevant to the response to
 xxxd2445xxx  of the egfr-overexpressing cell lines,
sum149 and sum102, because they differ with regard to
 xxxg722xxx  expression but have a similar response. further exploration of the role of  xxxg722xxx  in  xxxd2445xxx  response is
underway. elucidation of the mechanisms of resistance may
improve the selection of patients likely to respond to egfr
family inhibitors, indicate other relevant targets for inhibition, and guide rational selection of combinations of targeted therapeutic agents with different mechanisms of action.
perhaps an effective means of predicting the response
would be to measure the inhibitory effect of the egfr
family inhibitors on key downstream signal transduction

pathways, rather than receptor inhibition. our data expand
the results of others, and support the potential utility of
measuring the inhibition of downstream signaling as a predictor of response (12, 28). in contrast to the responding cell
lines, sum185 cells were refractory to  xxxd2445xxx -induced
inhibition constitutive downstream akt and erk phosphorylation, despite inhibition of receptor phosphorylation. although we, and others, have investigated the effect of
 xxxd2445xxx  on two of the major downstream signal transduction pathways that emanate from the egfr family receptors, the results of investigations of other important
pathways are pending. the sapks have been shown to play
a role in radiation response and may also be involved in
 xxxd2445xxx -induced radiosensitization of egfr-overexpressing cells (31). likewise, stats are involved in egfr
signal transduction, and stat3 is constitutively activated
in sum102 and sum149 cells (15). the dual egfr/her2
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor pki166 inhibits stat3 phosphorylation at doses that inhibit egfr autophosphorylation in
an orthotopic renal cell carcinoma model (32). the effect of
 xxxd2445xxx  on this mediator of egfr-related proliferative
signals warrants investigation.
conclusion
we have demonstrated for the first time the radiosensitizing effect of the dual egfr/her2 inhibitor,  xxxd2445xxx .
additional studies are underway to determine the effect in
vivo, the utility of measuring inhibition of downstream
signaling as a response predictor, and the mechanisms of
resistance.
