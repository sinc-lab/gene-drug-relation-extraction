abstract
the noradrenergic system may play a role in antipsychotic modulation of schizophrenia symptoms. therefore, the antagonistic potencies of
the antipsychotics clozapine, chlorpromazine, risperidone, olanzapine, haloperidol, quetiapine, ziprasidone,  xxxd2330xxx  and aripiprazole were
quantified using cell lines expressing the recombinant human a2c-adrenoceptor, a2a-adrenoceptor, or dopamine d2l receptor. the a2adrenoceptor antagonists, yohimbine and idazoxan, were also tested. alterations in camp were measured as changes in luminescence. in the
a2a-adrenoceptor cell line, the agonist 5-bromo-6-(2-imidazolin-2-ylamino)quinoxaline (uk14,304) induced a concentration-dependent
increase in luminescence. in cell lines expressing a2c and d2l receptors, agonists induced a concentration-dependent reduction in luminescence. yohimbine and idazoxan were the most potent a2a-adrenoceptor antagonists, yohimbine and  xxxd2330xxx  were the most potent
a2c-adrenoceptor antagonists, and haloperidol and olanzapine were the most potent dopamine  xxxg656xxx  antagonists. clozapine had the
highest a2c/d2 selectivity, and  xxxd2330xxx  the highest a2c/a2a ratio. it is hypothesised that a2c-adrenoceptor blockade contributes to
improvement of cognitive function.

1. introduction
the clinical potency of antipsychotic compounds is
related to the affinity for dopamine d2 receptors (seeman
et al., 1976; creese et al., 1976; schotte et al., 1996; kapur et
al., 2000). although the antipsychotic compounds display
rather equivalent efficacy against positive symptoms, they
differ with respect to improvement of cognitive dysfunction
(king, 1994; sharma, 1999) and regarding the induction of
extrapyramidal side effects (leucht et al., 1999). reduction
of d2 affinity seems to be a mechanism to decrease liability
for extrapyramidal side effects (kapur and seeman, 2001).
improvement or deterioration of cognitive function induced
by antipsychotic treatment is probably related to auxiliary
receptor activities (keefe et al., 1999; meltzer and mcgurk,
1999). the more recently developed polyvalent antipsychotic medications affect several neurotransmitter systems,
including the cholinergic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic,
histaminergic and dopaminergic systems (schotte et al.,
1996). clozapine, with its unique efficacy in severely treat* corresponding author. tel.: +41-61-324-4304; fax: +41-61-3245474.

ment-resistant patients (kane et al., 1988), is also unique
among the polyvalent antipsychotics as it has a profound
effect on central and peripheral noradrenaline turnover
(bürki et al., 1974; mcmillen and shore, 1978; pickar et
al., 1992; breier et al., 1994; elman et al., 1999). findings
from animal experiments suggest that noradrenaline may
play a modulating role in working memory by regulating
distraction by irrelevant stimuli during task performance
(arnsten et al., 1996; friedman et al., 1999). consistent with
this notion, clozapine improved attention, reaction time and
accuracy in neurocognitive tasks in patients with schizophrenia (lee et al., 1999; galletly et al., 2000; purdon et al.,
2001). enhancement of noradrenaline turnover (starke et al.,
1989) and improvement of cognitive function (arnsten et al.,
1996; coull, 1994) are mediated by the a2-adrenoceptor
subtype. it should be noted, however, that the a2-adrenoceptor is further divided into a2a, a2b and a2c receptor
subtypes (bylund et al., 1994), each with a distinct distribution and function in the brain (scheinin et al., 1994). the a2a
and a2c are the predominant subtypes in the brain (scheinin
et al., 1994).
the aim of this study was to characterise the intrinsic
activity and potency of binding for clozapine and other
antipsychotic compounds at the human a2a- and a2c-adre-

noceptors. since the potency of antipsychotics is related to
dopamine  xxxg656xxx  occupancy, with approximately
z 50% occupancy required for adequate control of positive
symptoms (nordström et al., 1993; kapur et al., 2000), the
intrinsic activity and potency of antipsychotics at the human
d2l receptors were tested as well. as test systems, cell lines
expressing recombinant a2a, a2c and d2l receptors were
used. as the a2 and d2 receptors are coupled to adenylate
cyclase, changes in luminescence induced by camp-response element (cre) were taken as functional read-outs.

calculated from the formula kb=[b]/(cr 1), where [b] is
the concentration of antagonist and cr is the agonist ic50
concentration ratio with and without antagonist (furchgott,
1972). although we tested whether the blockade of the
agonist-induced responses was concentration-dependent, it
was not the intention to formally investigate the competitive
nature of the blockade by means of schild-plot analyses.

3. results
3.1. a2c-adrenoceptor
noradrenaline caused a concentration-dependent reduction of  xxxd1742xxx -induced camp (figs. 1 and 2). with the
exception of idazoxan, none of the compounds induced
significant agonist activity in cells transfected with the
human a2c-adrenoceptor gene. the intrinsic activity of
idazoxan varied strongly from experiment to experiment
and ranged from 10% to 50% of the noradrenaline-induced
effect. a typical experiment is shown in fig. 1. despite
intrinsic activity, the potential antagonist properties could be
determined. idazoxan shifted the concentration – response
curves of noradrenaline rightward, but concomitantly
reduced the initial level of luminescence (an example of an
experiment is shown in fig. 1). clozapine was a ‘silent’
antagonist and caused a concentration-dependent shift of the
concentration – response curve for noradrenaline for accumulation of luminescence to the right in a parallel fashion
(see fig. 2). other antipsychotic compounds with potent
a2c-adrenoceptor antagonist properties were  xxxd2330xxx  and
risperidone (data not shown). aripiprazole could not be
tested at concentrations beyond 5000 nm because of cellular
toxicity. the rightward shift in the concentration– response
curves was used to calculate kb values according to the
method of furchgott (1972).

fig. 3. typical example of concentration – response curve of uk14,304 for
accumulation of luminescence in the presence or absence of idazoxan at the
human a2a-adrenoceptor (n: solvent; .: idazoxan 50 nm; e: idazoxan
100 nm; z: idazoxan 250 nm). data points represent means +/ standard
deviation of a triplicate measurement.

fig. 4. typical example of concentration – response curve of uk14,304 for
accumulation of luminescence in the presence or absence of clozapine at the
human a2a-adrenoceptor (n: solvent; .: clozapine 1000 nm; e: clozapine
5000 nm). data points represent means +/ standard deviation of a
triplicate measurement.

yohimbine was the most potent a2c-adrenoceptor antagonist [mean (s.e.m.) pkb value = 8.50 (0.02)], followed by
 xxxd2330xxx  [mean (s.e.m.) pkb value = 7.83 (0.06)] (table
1). potency of the other compounds fell in the following
order: risperidone>clozapine>idazoxan>ziprasidone>quetiapine>aripiprazole>olanzapine>chlorpromazine>haloperidol.
3.2. a2a-adrenoceptor
the potency to block the a2a-adrenoceptor was investigated for a selection of compounds that potently interacted with the a2c-adrenoceptor: yohimbine, idazoxan,
clozapine, quetiapine, risperidone, chlorpromazine and
 xxxd2330xxx . in the a2a-adrenoceptor expressing cells used
for the present experiments, the endogenous agonist,
noradrenaline, and the potent  xxxg82xxx  agonist,
uk14,304, activated, rather than inhibited, adenylate
cyclase. none of the test compounds (including idazoxan)

3.4. a2c/ xxxg656xxx  selectivity

displayed significant intrinsic activity in this cell system.
yohimbine, idazoxan (fig. 3), clozapine (fig. 4) and other
antipsychotic compounds shifted the concentration –
response curves for the effect on luminescence by
uk14,304 to the right in a parallel fashion. as in the
previous section, kb values were calculated according to
furchgott (1972). yohimbine was the most potent a2aadrenoceptor antagonist, followed by idazoxan, risperidone, clozapine and  xxxd2330xxx .

clozapine was the antipsychotic drug with the highest
a2c/d2 selectivity (a2c/d2 ratio = 12) followed, in order, by
 xxxd2330xxx  (ratio = 2), quetiapine (ratio = 1), risperidone
(ratio = 0.4), ziprasidone (ratio = 0.1), chlorpromazine (ratio
0.01) and olanzapine (ratio = 0.004). as might be expected,
haloperidol had the lowest a2c/d2 selectivity (ratio =
0.0005) (table 1).

3.3. d2l receptor

3.5. a2c/ xxxg82xxx  selectivity

consistent with previous studies (sokoloff and
schwartz, 1995), the functional response to d2l receptor
stimulation in hek293 cells was a reduction in forskolininduced intracellular camp levels. with the exception of
aripiprazole, none of the compounds tested had significant
agonist activity in cells transfected with the human d2l
receptor gene. in the present cell system, aripiprazole was
as efficacious as the endogenous agonist, dopamine, but
had an approximately 40-fold higher affinity. due to this
full agonist response, a kb value for aripiprazole could
not be established. the remaining antipsychotic compounds, but not the reference a2-adrenoceptor antagonists,
shifted the concentration –response curve for dopamine for
accumulation of luminescence to the right in a parallel
fashion. typical experiments are shown for idazoxan (fig.
5) and clozapine (fig. 6). these shifted curves were again
used to calculate kb values according to the method of
furchgott (1972).
haloperidol was the most potent dopamine  xxxg656xxx 
antagonist [mean (s.e.m.) pkb value = 8.73 (0.06)], followed
by olanzapine [mean (s.e.m.) pkb value = 8.36 (0.06)]
(table 1). potency of the other compounds fell in the following order: risperidone>chlorpromazine> xxxd2330xxx >ziprasidone>clozapine>quetiapine>yohimbine>idazoxan.

both yohimbine and idazoxan were slightly more potent
a2a antagonists than a2c antagonists (a2c/a2a ratios = 0.5
and 0.4, respectively). the opposite was true for clozapine,
chlorpromazine and risperidone (a2c/a2a ratio = 3– 4), quetiapine (ratio 9) and  xxxd2330xxx  (ratio = 12).

4. discussion
4.1. general considerations
earlier functional characterisation studies of a2-adrenoceptors in native tissue have generally reported that agonists
result in an inhibition of camp production (bylund et al.,
1994). in the present experiments, activation of human a2cadrenoceptors expressed in cho cells diminished camp
levels, which is consistent with the common view that a2adrenoceptors couple to gi/go proteins. in contrast, activation of human a2a-adrenoceptors expressed in cho cells
increased camp levels. increases in camp levels in
response to a2-adrenoceptor stimulation is not unprecedented in cell lines expressing recombinant a2-adrenoceptors (fraser et al., 1989; eason et al., 1992, 1994).
the functional response to d2l receptor stimulation in
hek293 cells was a reduction in intracellular camp levels,
which is consistent with published data (sokoloff and
schwartz, 1995). in each cell line, incubation with antagonists shifted the concentration – camp response curves to the
right in an approximately parallel manner. this enabled
determination of kb values for antagonist potency. although
we examined whether the blockade of the agonist-induced
responses was concentration-dependent, it was not our
intention to formally investigate the competitive nature of
the blockade by means of schild-plot analyses.
4.2. partial agonist responses

fig. 6. typical example of concentration – response curve of dopamine for
accumulation of luminescence in the presence or absence of clozapine at the
human d2l receptor (n: solvent; .: clozapine 500 nm; e: clozapine 1000
nm; z: clozapine 5000 nm). data points represent means +/ standard
deviation of a triplicate measurement.

antipsychotic drugs are generally thought to be antagonists at the sites for which they show high affinity in
radioligand binding screens. however, there are exceptions:
some antipsychotic drugs are known to activate muscarinic
receptors (zeng et al., 1997; olianas et al., 1999) or serotonin
5-ht1a receptors (newman-tancredi et al., 1998). in the cell
assay used for the present study, all antipsychotic drugs were

38

h.o. kalkman, e. loetscher / european journal of pharmacology 462 (2003) 33–40

silent a2a- and a2c-adrenoceptor antagonists. with the
notable exception of aripiprazole, the antipsychotic compounds also did not stimulate dopamine d2l receptors. in the
hek293 cells used for the present experiments, aripiprazole
displayed an intrinsic activity with a magnitude comparable
to that of dopamine. this is in line with lawler et al. (1999),
who used cho and c-6 cells transfected with rat d2l
receptors and noted that aripiprazole displayed partial agonist activity with an affinity higher than dopamine. intrinsic
activity depends on the test system and the receptor reserve
therein. therefore, our finding of a higher intrinsic activity is
not unusual. the results with aripiprazole, however, emphasise the point that second messenger experiments provide
important information in addition to classical radioligand
binding screens.
4.3. comparison with radioligand binding data
the results from the present functional experiments are in
general agreement with the radioligand binding study of
schotte et al. (1996). these authors reported that the binding
affinity of antipsychotic compounds was always higher for
a2c-adrenoceptors than for a2a-adrenoceptors. clozapine
and risperidone were among the compounds with the highest
affinity for a2c-adrenoceptors. the authors reported ki
values of clozapine and risperidone for human recombinant
a2c-adrenoceptors as 9.1 nm and clearly lower affinities for
ziprasidone (77 nm), olanzapine (210 nm), quetiapine (350
nm) and haloperidol (550 nm). this separation was also
found in the present functional study. the binding affinity of
 xxxd2330xxx  for the human a2c-adrenoceptor was previously
determined as (ki 16.2 nm) (kalkman et al., 2001). the a2cadrenoceptor affinity of aripiprazole has thus far not been
published. in a paper by jasper et al. (1998), idazoxan was
devoid of intrinsic activity at the human a2c-adrenoceptor.
this is at variance with the present results and may be
explained by higher receptor reserve in our cellular system.
the results of the present functional affinity experiments
generally support the radioligand binding data. in addition,
they offer important information regarding the effect of each
of these compounds on the receptors studied, which aids in
understanding and predicting therapeutic profiles of antipsychotic medications.
4.4. absolute and relative strength of a2-adrenoceptor
blockade
for therapeutic activity against psychoses, antipsychotic
drugs are dosed until central dopamine d2 receptors are
occupied by z 50% (nordström et al., 1993; kapur et al.,
2000). newer antipsychotic compounds are generally less
selective and bind to multiple receptor systems. in order to
contribute to the therapeutic profile, such auxiliary activities
should occur at doses that produce relevant central dopamine
 xxxg656xxx  blockade. in the current context, this means that
it is not so much the absolute affinity for a2a- and a2c-adre-

noceptors that matters, but rather the relative affinity vis-àvis the dopamine  xxxg656xxx . ratios for a2c/d2 z 1 were
obtained for clozapine,  xxxd2330xxx  and quetiapine, whereas
an a2a/d2 ratio z 1 was found for clozapine but not  xxxd2330xxx . for antipsychotic compounds with an a2c/d2 ratio
< 1, it is unlikely that a2-blockade will contribute substantially to the clinical profile. notably, olanzapine—which has
a chemical structure very similar to clozapine including a
polyvalent radioligand binding profile (especially if normalised to the respective d2 affinities)—strongly differs from
clozapine with regards to the affinity for a2-adrenoceptors
(schotte et al., 1996). this was also reflected in the present
experiments.
idazoxan was tested in an augmentation study by litman
et al. (1996). the authors investigated the effect of fluphenazine, an older dopamine  xxxg656xxx -blocking antipsychotic drug, and fluphenazine plus idazoxan in a doubleblind trial of 17 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective
disorder. the addition of the a2-adrenoceptor antagonist
idazoxan resulted in significant improvement in schizophrenia symptoms compared with fluphenazine alone. thus, there
could be significant functional consequence of a2c- and/or
a2a-adrenoceptor blockade by novel antipsychotics.
4.5. role of a2-adrenoceptor subtypes in cognitive function
the individual role of each of these subtypes on
neurocognition is not clear. working memory deficits in
experimental animals and in humans are ameliorated by
a2-adrenoceptor agonists like guanfacine or clonidine
(birnbaum et al., 2000; li et al., 1999; jäkälä et al.,
1999). the observation that guanfacine seems to induce
more robust effects than clonidine has been explained by a
higher a2a-subtype selectivity (jäkälä et al., 1999). the
preclinical literature about effects of selective a2-adrenoceptor antagonists in cognition tests is confusing. a2-adrenoceptor antagonists both improve (haapalinna et al., 1998;
middleton et al., 1999) and deteriorate cognitive function
(sawaguchi, 1998; mcallister, 2001). differences in subtype
selectivity might provide an explanation. it is conceivable
that a2a-adrenoceptor stimulation has a positive effect on
cognition, while a2a-adrenoceptor blockade has a negative
effect. the opposite could be true for the a2c-adrenoceptor
agonists and antagonists, since overexpression of a2c-adrenoceptors in mice impaired their ability to perform spatial and
nonspatial cognitive tasks (björklund et al., 1999). the novel
antipsychotic compound  xxxd2330xxx  (szewczak et al., 1995)
could be an interesting candidate for the evaluation of the a2c
hypothesis. this compound displays an a2c-adrenoceptor/
dopamine d2 ratio that is closer to that of clozapine than any
other compound presently tested. however,  xxxd2330xxx 
remains to be studied in cognition tests.
in conclusion, the affinity for a2c-adrenoceptors and
dopamine d2 receptors was investigated in a series of
compounds, including yohimbine, idazoxan, and the antipsychotics clozapine and  xxxd2330xxx . yohimbine and

h.o. kalkman, e. loetscher / european journal of pharmacology 462 (2003) 33–40

 xxxd2330xxx  were the most potent a2c-adrenoceptor antagonists, and haloperidol and olanzapine were the most
potent dopamine  xxxg656xxx  antagonists. clozapine had
the highest a2c/d2 selectivity, followed by  xxxd2330xxx ,
quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, olanzapine and haloperidol. the a2c-adrenoceptor blockade of antipsychotic
compounds (if occurring at concentrations needed for
dopamine d 2 receptor blockade) may contribute to
improvements in working memory.
