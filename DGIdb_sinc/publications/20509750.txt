abstract
1.  xxxd1883xxx  ( xxxd1883xxx ; 6alpha,9-difluoro- xxxd3003xxx  21-acetate 17-butyrate) is an effective anti-inflammatory agent derived from prednisolone. the present study aimed to
evaluate the metabolite profile of  xxxd1883xxx  in rabbit ocular tissues after instillation of  xxxd1883xxx  ophthalmic
emulsion.
2. the high-performance liquid chromatography with radiochemical detection was employed to analyze
radioactivity in rabbit ocular tissues that had been instilled with a 3h- xxxd1883xxx  0.05% ophthalmic emulsion. at 0.5 and 2 h after instillation,  xxxd1883xxx  was not detected in the cornea, aqueous humor, or iris/ciliary body. instead, 21-deacetylated  xxxd1883xxx  (dfb), 17-debutylated dfb (df), and an unknown metabolite
were found.
3. the unknown metabolite was identified as de-17-side chain-glucocorticoid metabolite (df21c), which
is a novel glucocorticoid metabolite formed by the scission of the 17-side chain via an unknown metabolic reaction pathway. the ki value of df21c was 5.6 × 10−7 mol/l, indicating very weak glucocorticoid
receptor binding of df21c (approximately 1000-fold less than that of  xxxd1883xxx  and dfb).

introduction
glucocorticoid (gc) ophthalmic drugs, including prednisolone acetate, fluoromethoron, dexamethasone, and
betamethasone sodium phosphate, are widely used to
treat ocular inflammation. gc ophthalmic drugs reportedly, however, cause adverse reactions in which the
increase of intraocular pressure (tripathi et al. 2003) and
cataract (gupta & wagner 2009) is the most representative ones. after instillation, the gcs are enzymatically
metabolized in the ocular tissues, releasing both the gc
and its metabolites into surrounding ocular tissues. both
the distribution and retention of these chemicals are
important indicators of the anti-inflammatory potential
and possible side effects of the drug.

 xxxd1883xxx  ( xxxd1883xxx ) is an effective anti-­inflammatory
prednisolone derivative developed in japan for use as
a dermatologial preparation. this was designed via a
structure–activity relationship approach (bodor et al.
1983) and synthesized by replacing hydrogen atoms at
the 6- and 9-positions with fluorine, the 17-hydroxyl
group with butyrate, and the 21-hydroxyl group with
acetate. both dermal and subcutaneous administrations of  xxxd1883xxx  have been shown to reduce inflammation
in animal models (navarro et al. 1978; takahashi et al.
1985a; 1985b). fujino et al. (1985a; 1985b; 1985c) extensively examined the pharmacokinetics and metabolism
of  xxxd1883xxx  by using plasma, urine, bile and feces samples
after both dermal and subcutaneous administration of
tritium-labeled (3h-)  xxxd1883xxx . this work indicated that the

main metabolic reactions of  xxxd1883xxx  were 21-deacetylation,
17-debutylation, 20-reduction, 6-hydroxylation, conjugation, and combinations thereof. because of the large
number of gc metabolic pathways, not all metabolites
of  xxxd1883xxx  have been determined in animal models, and
the structures of at least seven metabolites are yet to be
elucidated (fujino et al. 1985c).
because  xxxd1883xxx  is hydrophobic (yamaguchi et al.
2005), it is formulated as a lipid emulsion for ophthalmic use. after instillation,  xxxd1883xxx  is rapidly hydrolyzed to
21-deacetylated  xxxd1883xxx  (dfb), an active metabolite, in the
aqueous humor (yasueda et al. 2003). clinically,  xxxd1883xxx 
0.05% ophthalmic emulsion is effective in the treatment of
uveitis (jamal & callanan 2009), inflammation after ocular surgery (korenfeld et al. 2009), and refractory diabetic
macular edema after vitrectomy (nakano et al. 2010).
in the present study,  xxxd1883xxx  0.05% ophthalmic emulsion was instilled in order to examine the metabolic
profile of  xxxd1883xxx  in rabbit ocular tissues, including the
cornea, aqueous humor, and iris/ciliary body. this
allowed us to identify a novel metabolite as well as to
determine its chemical structure and to evaluate its gc
activity.

methanol and acetonitrile (hplc grade) were purchased
from wako pure chemical industries ltd. (osaka, japan)
and kanto chemical co., inc. (tokyo, japan). all other
reagents were obtained from commercial sources and
were of the highest grade available.
synthesis of metabolite standard
a de-17-side chain-gc metabolite of  xxxd1883xxx  (df21c) was
experimentally synthesized by senju pharmaceutical co.,
ltd. (kobe, japan) from df21b via dfdm (6alpha,9-difluoro21-dimethoxy-11beta-hydroxy-1,4-pregnadiene-3,20-dione)
(figure 2). specifically, df21b (2.7 g, 5.8 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (100 ml) and then combined with
4 mol/l hcl-1, xxxd1904xxx  (15 ml). the mixture was stirred
at room temperature for 48 h and concentrated in vacuo.
a 10% (v/v) sodium acetate solution (50 ml) was added
to the residue, and the desired product was extracted with
dichloromethane (300 ml × 2), washed with saturated
saline, dried over  xxxd2534xxx , and concentrated to dryness
in vacuo. the dfdm in the residue was washed with
hexane and ethyl acetate. next, dfdm (1.0 g, 2.36 mmol)
was dissolved in methanol (150 ml) and combined with
purified water (150 ml) and hcl (30 ml). this mixture
was stirred at 70°c for 56 h under airtight conditions. the
concentrated solution produced an intermediate that was
extracted with dichloromethane (300 ml × 2), washed
with saturated saline (100 ml × 2), dried over  xxxd2534xxx , and
concentrated to dryness in vacuo. after the intermediate
(0.93 g) was dissolved in methanol (100 ml), it was combined with acetic acid (0.28 g, 4.68 mmol), nacn (0.61 g,
12.41 mmol), and silver oxide (2.0 g, 16.14 mmol). next,
the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 0.5 h and
filtered, allowing extraction of the desired product with
ethyl acetate (500 ml) that had previously been washed
with saturated saline (200 ml × 2). the organic layer was
dried over  xxxd2534xxx  and concentrated in vacuo to produce a
yellow oil. this was dissolved in purified water/methanol
(1:1, v/v, 1000 ml), after which it was combined with 1 n
naoh (4 ml). the solution was applied to sepabeads™
(sp825, 10 cm id × 10 cm; mitsubishi chemical co., tokyo,
japan) and demineralized by water. the fraction containing df21c was eluted by methanol and evaporated, yielding df21c (0.3 g, 32%) as a white solid. the proton (1h)
and carbon 13 (13c)-nuclear magnetic resonance data of
df21c are listed in table 1.

following acclimatization, 13 animals with body mass of
1.59–1.97 kg were selected for study, with 10 and 3 animals allocated to group a for radioactivity measurement
and group b for df21c identification, respectively. the

animals in the group a were subdivided into 6 and 4 to
determine the radioactivity at 0.5 and 2 h after instillation,
respectively by taking into account the quantifiable tissue
radioactivity. all animals were given approximately 90 g
of solid feed (lrc4; oriental yeast co., ltd., tokyo, japan)
once a day, while water was supplied ad libitum. all animal procedures were approved by the animal experiment
committee of senju pharmaceutical co., ltd.
dosing methods
h- xxxd1883xxx  or  xxxd1883xxx  was dissolved in castor oil and emulsified in a homomixer (t.k. auto homomixer m type;
primix co., osaka, japan) to achieve a 0.05% concentration (yamaguchi et al. 2005). the 3h- xxxd1883xxx  ophthalmic
emulsion (0.015 mg/30 mul/eye) was applied five times,
at 5-min intervals, to both eyes of each rabbit in group a,
while the  xxxd1883xxx  ophthalmic emulsion was applied five
times to both eyes of each rabbit in group b.

sampling of ocular tissues
prior to instilling the ophthalmic emulsions, all study
animals were anaesthetized with a 5% pentobarbital
solution (1 ml/kg) injected into the auricular vein. at
0.5 or 2 h after the final instillation, all animals were
sacrificed via exsanguination from the abdominal aorta.
after washing the conjunctival sacs with 30 ml of physiological saline warmed to approximately 37°c, both eyes
were collected from all animals. to measure radioactivity,
the cornea, iris/ciliary body, and aqueous humor from 6

572   t. tajika et al.
animals (0.5 h) or from 4 animals (2 h) were collected and
weighed. to identify df21c, the cornea from 3 animals
were collected and weighed.

radioactivity measurement in the cornea, iris/ciliary
body, and aqueous humor
five milliliter of methanol was immediately added to the
cornea and iris/ciliary body after extraction and then
homogenized samples under ice-cold conditions. next,
0.1 g of the homogenate was removed, dried under nitrogen gas flow, and solubilized the residue in soluene-350
(perkinelmer inc., waltham, ma). finally, after adding
10 ml of hionic-fluor (perkinelmer inc.) to the solubilized sample, the radioactivity of sample was measured.
the remaining homogenate was centrifuged (1800g,
4°c, 10 min), 5 ml of methanol was added to the precipitates, and the mixture was shaken for 10 min prior to a
second round of centrifuging. after collecting the supernatant, this process was repeated for a second time. the
resulting supernatants were combined and suspended
in methanol to bring the total volume to 20 ml. one milliliter of this solution was removed and dried at approximately 40°c. the remaining residue was collected and
dissolved in methanol, then combined with 10 ml of
hionic-fluor in order to measure radioactivity. finally,
the remaining supernatant was concentrated under
reduced pressure followed by reconstitution in 0.1%
 xxxd2154xxx /acetonitrile (90/10, v/v) for hplc analysis.
one-tenth milliliter of the aqueous humor was
removed and dried under nitrogen gas flow. the residue
was then solubilized in soluene-350. after adding 10 ml
of hionic-fluor to the sample, the radioactivity was measured. the remaining samples were immediately stored at
approximately 4°c for hplc analysis.
for all samples, a liquid scintillation counter (lsc,
2500tr; packard instrument co., meriden, ct) was used
to measure radioactivity for 2 min. the counting coefficient was calibrated by the external standard radiation
source method. background values were defined as the
mean radioactivity of samples taken from animals not
treated with either the drug or the solvents.
radioactivity detection limits were defined as twice
background levels. concentration was expressed as whole
numbers by rounding to the first decimal digit after the
concentrations were converted to  xxxd1883xxx  equivalents. concentrations lower than the detection limit were
designated “not detected” (nd).
hplc radioactivity analysis and co-chromatography
the hplc was fitted with tskgel ods 80-ts column
(4.6 mm id × 150 mm length; tosoh co., tokyo, japan) and
performed as a gradient elution, where 0.1%  xxxd2154xxx 
and acetonitrile were used as mobile phases. the ratio of

0.1%  xxxd2154xxx  to acetonitrile was increased from 10% at
0 min to 60% at 50 min in a linear fashion and was constant
until 55 min. the flow rate was 1.0 ml/min and the column
temperature was kept at 40°c. the eluate was analyzed with
a ultraviolet (uv) detector (spd-10avp; shimadzu co.,
kyoto, japan) at 240 nm and a radioactivity detector (floone/525tr; packard instruments co.). additionally, each
combined tissue samples (cornea and iris/ciliary body or
cornea and aqueous humor) were analyzed by hplc cochromatography for confirming whether the retention time
of the unknown metabolite in each tissue is identical.
measurement df21c in cornea
the combined corneas were minced in 5 ml of methanol. next, after shaking the specimens, the samples
were centrifuged (1800g, room temperature, 10 min) to
obtain a supernatant. the pellets were combined and
treated with 5 ml of methanol, and the entire procedure was repeated to produce a second supernatant.
the two supernatants were combined, the solvent was
evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure, and
the residue was reconstituted in 1 ml of hplc mobile
phase solvent (0.1% acetic acid/acetonitrile, 90:10 v/v).
the resulting solutions were passed through a 0.45-mum
filter, and the filtrates were used as hplc with tandem
mass spectrometry (lc-ms/ms) samples.
identification of df21c
the samples were analyzed with lc-ms/ms
(nanospace si-2; shiseido co., ltd., tokyo, japan,
api4000; applied biosystems co., carlsbad, ca) with
electrospray ionization in the negative-ion mode, using
0.1% acetic acid and acetonitrile as mobile phases. the
ratio of 0.1% acetic acid to acetonitrile was increased
from 10% at 0 min to 60% at 18 min in a linear fashion
and was constant until 20 min. capcell pak c18 mgii
(s-5 mum, 1.5 mm id × 100 mm length; shiseido co., ltd.)
was used as a column. flow rate was 0.2 ml/min., with
a column temperature of 40°c. spectrometer settings
(lens voltages, quadrupole and octapole voltage offsets,
etc.) were optimized for df21c with the auto-tune function. data were processed using analyst (version 1.4;
applied biosystems co.).

the hplc uv-chromatogram of reference compounds
is shown in figure 3. only three peaks emerge in the
hplc radio-chromatograms of the cornea, aqueous
humor, and iris/ciliary body (figure 4). compared to
the retention times of standard compounds,  xxxd1883xxx  was
not observed, but dfb, df, and an unknown metabolite
(designated as m1, m2, and m3 in the cornea, aqueous humor, and iris/ciliary body, respectively) were
detected in each tissue. the retention times of m1,
m2, and m3 were same in the analysis with hplc cochromatography. this result confirmed that the m1, m2,
and m3 were identical.
the lc-ms [mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 393] chromatograms (negative-ion mode) of rabbit corneal
specimens obtained at 0.5 h after instillation of  xxxd1883xxx 
0.05% ophthalmic emulsion show a peak with a retention time of approximately 12.8 min, which was the
same as that of the df21c metabolite standard. the
lc-ms/ms daughter scan spectrum shows the major
fragment ions at m/z 265, 285, and 393, which were the
same as those of the df21c standard (figure 5). on the
basis of these results, we conclude that the unknown
metabolite (molecular weight: 394) detected in the in
vivo specimens is df21c. the ki value of df21c was
5.6 × 10−7 mol/l, indicating very weak gc receptor bind-

results

ing of df21c (approximately 1000-fold less than that of
 xxxd1883xxx  and dfb) (table 2).
at 0.5 h after instillation, dfb was the dominant
metabolite in all tissues. however, at 2 h after instillation,
df21c was the dominant metabolite in both the cornea
and aqueous humor (table 3) and the concentration of
dfb was reduced to approximately a quarter of its value
at the 0.5 h measurement. because this reduction rate of
dfb was higher than that of the total radioactivity concentration in each tissue, the reduction of dfb is likely
to be attributable to its intensive metabolic conversion to
df21c and df in the ocular tissues (figure 6).

radioactivity (cpm)

displacement was mixed with the gc receptor protein of
rat liver cytosol (50 mug protein/ml) and incubated at 4°c
for 18 h, followed by counting the radioactivity using lsc
(1500; perkinelmer inc.) for 2 min. the relative binding
affinities of df21c,  xxxd1883xxx , dfb, and dexamethasone to
the gc receptor protein were analyzed by measuring the
radioactivity. this allowed us to calculate the ki values of
each drug.

discussion
 xxxd1883xxx  was rapidly metabolized to dfb, df, and df21c
that was a novel metabolite when topically applied to
the ocular tissues of rabbits. several other metabolites
(df20h, df21b, hfb, hf, and hf20h; figure 1) previously observed in the blood, urine, and feces of rats and
rabbits systemically exposed to  xxxd1883xxx  were not detected
in this study.
the ocular tissues of rabbits contain esterases (lee
et al. 1985), which may be involved in the hydrolysis of
21-ester-gcs to 21-alcohol-gcs (yamauchi et al. 1975;

these results, we predicted that  xxxd1883xxx  in ocular tissues
would be enzymatically hydrolyzed mainly to dfb and
df, as observed in systemic tissues (fujino et al. 1985c).

reasons. first, we detected a relatively small amount of
df. this may result from steric hindrance of enzymatic
hydrolysis, as previously observed in skin samples that
received topical application of 17-ester-gcs (shindo et al.
1984a; 1984b). second, we detected a large concentration
of a novel third metabolite, df21c. this led us to investigate, in greater detail, the metabolic process that led to
the formation of this product.
our radioactivity concentration data suggest that
df21c is probably metabolized in the ocular tissues via
the pathway shown in figure 6. because this metabolite
was formed from dfb in cornea homogenate in vitro but
not formed in heat-denatured one (data not shown), we
confirmed the involvement of enzyme(s) in this process.

although we have yet identified the enzyme(s) involved
in this metabolic pathway, we speculate that dfb is first
converted to de-17-acyloxy-21-cho by the liberation
of the butyloxy group at the 17-position, and then to
df21c by the oxidation of the 21-position (figure 7).
previous studies detected at least seven unidentified
metabolites in the blood, urine, and feces of rats and
rabbits after subcutaneous administration of 3h- xxxd1883xxx 
(fujino et al. 1985c). to compare this observation with
the results of the present study, we analyzed the cornea
sample by using two-dimensional thin layer chromatography under the same conditions (fujino et al. 1985c). we
observed two radioactive spots at positions corresponding to dfb and df21c (data not shown). on the basis

figure 7. proposed metabolic pathway for the formation of df21c from dfb.

of rf values, it seems that df21c was contained in the
origin spot of polar metabolite(s) in previous studies.
this indicates that the metabolism of  xxxd1883xxx  is probably
very simple in the ocular tissues and is only mediated by
hydrolysis and reduction.
the gc receptor binding activity of df21c was very
weak — approximately 1000-fold less than that of  xxxd1883xxx .
this implies that df21c was not activity involved in both
anti-inflammatory effect and side effects such as the
development of steroid cataracts (polansky & winereb
1984) or glaucoma (tamada et al. 1978). likewise, df
was also not very active (sakaki et al. 2006). however,
the gc receptor binding activity of dfb was similar to
that of  xxxd1883xxx . hence, we estimate that dfb contributes
significantly to the anti-inflammatory effects of  xxxd1883xxx 
emulsions instilled on ocular tissues.
in summary, three metabolites of  xxxd1883xxx  were detected
after its instillation on rabbit ocular tissues via ophthalmic
emulsion:  xxxd1883xxx , df, and the novel metabolite df21c.
although we have done some preliminary investigations of the pathway that produces df21c, further work
is needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms leading to
the formation of this metabolite. finally, our work on gc
binding activity indicates that of the three metabolites
produced from  xxxd1883xxx  in the ocular tissues, dfb has the
greatest anti-inflammatory activity.
