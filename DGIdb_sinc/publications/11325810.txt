1 we examined the eect of the sulphonylurea  xxxd2203xxx  on three types of recombinant atpsensitive potassium (katp) channels.
2 katp channels share a common pore-forming subunit,  xxxg1250xxx , which associates with dierent
sulphonylurea receptor isoforms ( xxxg19xxx  in b-cells, sur2a in heart and sur2b in smooth muscle).
3  xxxg1250xxx  was coexpressed with  xxxg19xxx , sur2a or sur2b in xenopus oocytes and macroscopic
katp currents were recorded from giant inside-out membrane patches.  xxxd2203xxx  was added to the
intracellular membrane surface.
4  xxxd2203xxx  inhibited  xxxg1250xxx /sur currents by interaction with two sites: a low-anity site on
 xxxg1250xxx  (ic50=*400 mm) and a high-anity site on sur (ic50=3.0 nm for  xxxg19xxx , 5.4 nm for
sur2a and 7.3 nm for sur2b). the potency of  xxxd2203xxx  at the high-anity site is close to that
observed for  xxxd2215xxx  (4 nm for  xxxg19xxx , 27 nm for sur2a), which has a similar structure.
5  xxxd2203xxx  inhibition of  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a and  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b currents, but not  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx 
currents, reversed rapidly.
6 our results indicate that  xxxd2203xxx  is a high-anity sulphonylurea that does not select between
the b-cell, cardiac and smooth muscle types of recombinant  xxxg1253xxx , when measured in insideout patches. high-anity inhibition is mediated by interaction of the drug with the sulphonylurea
receptor subunit of the channel.

introduction
sulphonylureas stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic bcells and are widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes
mellitus. their principal target is the atp-sensitive potassium
(katp) channel, which plays a major role in controlling the
b-cell membrane potential. inhibition of katp channels by
glucose or sulphonylureas causes depolarization of the b-cell
membrane; in turn, this triggers the opening of voltage-gated
ca2+ channels, eliciting ca2+ in¯ux and a rise in intracellular
ca2+ which stimulates the exocytosis of insulin-containing
secretory granules (ashcroft & rorsman, 1989).
katp channels are also found at high density in a variety
of other cell types including cardiac, smooth and skeletal
muscle, and some brain neurones (ashcroft & ashcroft,
1990). although their roles in extra-pancreatic tissues are less
well characterised, it is likely that they open in response to
metabolic stress, such as that which occurs during cardiac
and cerebral ischaemia (nichols & lederer, 1991). they are
also important in the control of vascular smooth muscle tone,
and thus of blood pressure (quayle et al., 1997). it is
therefore of importance to know the anity of the dierent
types of  xxxg1253xxx  for the various sulphonylureas.

the  xxxg1253xxx  is a hetero-octameric complex of two
structurally distinct proteins: an inwardly-rectifying k-channel,
 xxxg1250xxx , and a sulphonylurea receptor, sur (aguilar-bryan et
al., 1995; inagaki et al., 1995; 1996; 1997; isomoto et al., 1996;
sakura et al., 1995; clement et al., 1997; shyng & nichols,
1997). the former acts as an atp-sensitive k-channel pore
while sur is a channel regulator which endows  xxxg1250xxx  with
sensitivity to drugs such as the inhibitory sulphonylureas and
the k-channel openers (tucker et al., 1997). katp channels in
dierent tissues usually share a common  xxxg1250xxx  subunit, but
possess dierent types of sur subunit, which accounts for
their dierent drug sensitivities (ashcroft & gribble, 1998;
1999). the b-cell  xxxg1253xxx  is composed of  xxxg1250xxx  and
 xxxg19xxx , the cardiac type of  xxxg1250xxx  and sur2a and that in some
smooth muscle types, probably, of  xxxg1250xxx  and sur2b (smooth
muscle channels may also be composed of kir6.1 and sur2b
subunits). both  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b combinations are also found in the brain. although wild-type katp
channels require both types of subunit ( xxxg1250xxx  and sur) for
functional activity, a mutant form of  xxxg1250xxx  with a c-terminal
truncation of *20 ± 40 amino acids (kir6.2dc) is capable of
independent expression (tucker et al., 1997). kir6.2dc therefore provides a useful tool for studying the eects of drugs on
the pore-forming subunit of the  xxxg1253xxx .
a number of studies suggest that the dierent types of katp
channel exhibit dierent speci®cities towards the various
sulphonylureas. in particular, both  xxxd3394xxx  and  xxxd2202xxx 

194

d.-k. song & f.m. ashcroft

inhibit  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx , but not  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a, channels by
interaction with a high-anity site located on  xxxg19xxx  (gribble et
al., 1997b; gribble & ashcroft, 1999). similar results have been
reported for  xxxd2215xxx  block of native b-cell and cardiac
katp channels (trube et al., 1986; ventakesh et al., 1991).
these results suggest that only  xxxg19xxx  possesses a high-anity
binding site for these sulphonylureas. in contrast, meglitinide, a
benzamido derivative equivalent to the non-sulphonylurea
moiety of  xxxd2215xxx , mediates high-anity inhibition of
both b-cell and cardiac types of  xxxg1253xxx  (native and
recombinant) (garrino et al., 1985; gribble et al., 1997b; 1998).
these results have been interpreted to indicate that both  xxxg19xxx 
and sur2a may possess a benzamido-binding site. like
meglitinide, but in contrast to  xxxd3394xxx ,  xxxd2215xxx 
blocks both native and recombinant b-cell and cardiac katp
channels with high anity (gribble et al., 1998; zuènckler et al.,
1988a; barret-jolley & mcpherson, 1998; findlay, 1992).
because  xxxd2215xxx  contains both the sulphonylurea and
benzamido moieties, this suggests that the drug may bind
simultaneously to both  xxxd3394xxx  and benzamido-binding
sites of  xxxg19xxx , but only to the benzamido-binding site on
sur2a. this may account for the fact that inhibition of
 xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  currents by  xxxd2215xxx  is only poorly
reversible in electrophysiological experiments, while inhibition
of  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a and  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b currents is readily
reversed (ashcroft & gribble, 1999).
 xxxd2203xxx  (figure 1) is a sulphonylurea that stimulates
insulin secretion and has recently been introduced for the
treatment of type-2 diabetes. despite blocking katp channels
in pancreatic b-cells with high anity (schwanstecher et al.,
1994) it has been suggested that the mechanism of action of
 xxxd2203xxx  diers from that of other sulphonylureas (kramer
et al., 1994, 1996; muèller et al., 1994). in this paper we
examine the eect of  xxxd2203xxx  on three types of
recombinant katp channels expressed in xenopus oocytes:
 xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx ,  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a and  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b. these

 xxxd2203xxx  block of katp channels

correspond to the b-cell, cardiac and smooth muscle types
of  xxxg1253xxx , respectively. we conclude that the drug
blocks all three types of  xxxg1253xxx  with similar ecacy in
excised membrane patches, and that its mechanism of action
is similar to that of  xxxd2215xxx .

methods
molecular biology
mouse  xxxg1250xxx  (genbank d50581; inagaki et al., 1995; sakura
et al., 1995), rat  xxxg19xxx  (genbank l40624; aguilar-bryan et al.,
1995), sur2a (genbank d83598; inagaki et al., 1996) and
sur2b (genbank d86038; isomoto et al., 1996) cdnas were
cloned into the pbf vector. a truncated form of  xxxg1250xxx 
(kir6.2dc36), which lacks the c-terminal 36 amino acids and
forms functional channels in the absence of sur, was prepared
as described previously (tucker et al., 1997). capped mrna
was prepared using the mmessage mmachine large scale
in vitro transcription kit (ambion, austin, tx, u.s.a.), as
previously described (gribble et al., 1997a).

oocyte collection
female xenopus laevis were anaesthetized with ms222
(2 g l71 added to the water). one ovary was removed via a
mini-laparotomy, the incision sutured and the animal allowed
to recover. immature stage v ± vi oocytes were incubated for
60 min with 1.0 mg ml71 collagenase (sigma, type v) and
manually defolliculated. oocytes were either injected with
*1 ng kir6.2dc36 mrna or coinjected with *0.1 ng
 xxxg1250xxx  mrna and *2 ng of mrna encoding either
 xxxg19xxx , sur2a or sur2b. the ®nal injection volume was
50 nl per oocyte. isolated oocytes were maintained in barth's
solution and studied 1 ± 4 days after injection (gribble et al.,
1997a).

patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass and had
resistances of 250 ± 500 ko when ®lled with pipette solution.
macroscopic currents were recorded from giant excised
inside-out patches at a holding potential of 0 mv and at
20 ± 248c (gribble et al., 1997a). currents were evoked by
repetitive 3 s voltage ramps from 7110 mv to +100 mv and
recorded using an epc7 patch-clamp ampli®er (list electronik, darmstadt, germany). they were ®ltered  xxxd1891xxx  khz,
digitized at 0.4 khz using a digidata 1200 interface and
analysed using pclamp 8 software (axon instruments, foster
city, u.s.a.). records were stored on videotape and
resampled at 20 hz for presentation in the ®gures.
the pipette (external) solution contained (mm): kcl 140,
mgcl2 1.2, cacl2 2.6, hepes 10 (ph 7.4 with koh). the
intracellular (bath) solution contained (mm): kcl 107, mgcl2
2, cacl2 1, egta 10, hepes 10 (ph 7.2 with koh; ®nal
[k+] *140 mm).  xxxd2203xxx  (supplied by iris) was
prepared as a 50 mm stock solution in dmso, and the ph
of the bath solution was readjusted after drug addition. the
®nal [k+] was about 140 mm after addition of  xxxd2203xxx .
rapid exchange of solutions was achieved by positioning
the patch in the mouth of one of a series of adjacent in¯ow

d.-k. song & f.m. ashcroft

pipes placed in the bath. test solutions were applied in
random order, and patches were exposed to 1 mm mgatp at
intervals throughout the experiment, to reverse channel
rundown.
in a previous study of  xxxd2203xxx  on native katp currents
(schwanstecher et al., 1994), pancreatic b-cells were preincubated with the drug and the katp current subsequently
measured as the whole-cell current activated on washout of
cellular atp. the current amplitudes were then compared with
those of b-cells that had not been exposed to the drug. this
strategy relies on two assumptions: (i) that all cells express
approximately the same amount of katp current (because it is
not possible to record the control current, in the absence of the
drug, in the same b-cell); and (ii), that the drug does not
accumulate inside the cell to a concentration higher than that in
the external solution. neither of these assumptions is valid for
katp channels heterologously expressed in xenopus oocytes.
the level of expression may vary from oocyte to oocyte;
furthermore, the lipid-soluble sulphonylureas appear to
accumulate within the oocyte (which has a high lipid content)
because drugs like  xxxd3394xxx , which are readily reversible in
excised patches, are not reversible on intact oocytes. we
therefore added  xxxd2203xxx  to the intracellular surface of
excised inside-out membrane patches.

measured in control solution before addition of the drug.
because the drug was essentially irreversible on the time scale
of our experiments, it was not possible to calculate the mean
conductance in control solution before and after drug
addition. the lack of reversibility also meant that a drug
concentration could only be applied to a given patch once.
thus each data point represents a dierent oocyte.

results
macroscopic currents were recorded in inside-out membrane
patches from xenopus oocytes coexpressing  xxxg1250xxx  and either
 xxxg19xxx , sur2a or sur2b. in all cases, the currents were
small in the cell-attached con®guration but increased
markedly when the patch was excised into nucleotide-free
solution, consistent with the idea that the  xxxg1253xxx  is
blocked in the intact oocyte by cytoplasmic nucleotides such
as atp.

data analysis
the slope conductance was measured by ®tting a straight line
to the current-voltage relation between 720 mv and
7100 mv: the average of ®ve consecutive ramps was
calculated in each solution. data are presented as mean+1
s.e.mean.

figure 2 shows that application of 1 mm  xxxd2203xxx  to the
intracellular membrane surface blocked all three types of
 xxxg1253xxx , to a similar extent. the mean block of  xxxg1250xxx /
 xxxg19xxx  currents was 80+2% (n=7), of  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a
currents was 78+2% (n=12), and of  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b currents
was 80+3% (n=8). the very slow decline in current
observed in the presence of  xxxd2203xxx  in some patches is
probably due to rundown of channel activity, as a similar
decrease is also observed in control solution (tucker et al.,
1997). it is believed to result from a gradual fall in the
membrane concentration of the phospholipid pip2 (baukrowitz et al., 1998; shyng & nichols, 1998).
the block of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  currents was not reversible on
the time scale of our experiments for any drug concentration
(figure 2). in contrast, inhibition of  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a and
 xxxg1250xxx /sur2b currents by  xxxd2203xxx  concentrations of
5100 mm was partially reversed on return to control
solution; at higher drug concentrations, however, the block
was also irreversible.
the relationship between the  xxxd2203xxx  concentration and
the katp current for  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx ,  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a and
 xxxg1250xxx /sur2b channels is shown in figure 3. as with other
sulphonylureas, inhibition of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  currents by
 xxxd2203xxx  (figure 3a) was best ®t by assuming that the
drug interacted with both high and low-anity sites. the
ic50s of these sites were 3.0+0.5 nm and 234+139 mm
(n=5 ± 13), respectively. likewise,  xxxd2203xxx  blocked
 xxxg1250xxx /sur2a (figure 3b) and  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b (figure 3c).
currents by interaction with both a high-anity and a lowanity site. the ic50s were 5.4+0.1 nm and 104+56 mm
(n=6 ± 12), respectively, for  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a currents and
7.3+0.2 nm and 98.9+75 mm (n=5 ± 13), respectively, for
 xxxg1250xxx /sur2b currents.
the hill coecients for the high-anity site were
0.64+0.06 (n=5 ± 13) and 0.69+0.09 (n=6 ± 12) for channels
containing  xxxg19xxx  and sur2a, respectively. the fact that the
hill coecient is less than unity may indicate that there is
more than one binding site for the drug and that there is
negative cooperativity between these sites. this may re¯ect
the fact that the channel is a tetramer (clement et al., 1997;
shyng & nichols, 1997). in the case of  xxxd2215xxx , it
appears all four subunits bind the drug although occupation
of a single site is sucient to induce channel closure,
(doèrschner et al., 1999).
low-anity inhibition of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a
channels by other sulphonylureas is not conferred by the
sulphonylurea receptor, because it is observed when truncated
 xxxg1250xxx  subunits (kir6.2dc36) are expressed in the absence of
sur (gribble et al., 1997b; 1998). to investigate whether the
low-anity site for  xxxd2203xxx  inhibition is also independent
of sur, we tested the eect of the drug on kir6.2dc36
channels. figure 4 shows that  xxxd2203xxx  blocked
kir6.2dc36 currents at low anity, with an ic50 of around
0.4 mm, suggesting that the low-anity site for  xxxd2203xxx 
inhibition lies on  xxxg1250xxx  itself. it was not possible to dissolve
the drug at concentrations greater than 0.5 mm, so that the

discussion
our results demonstrate that  xxxd2203xxx  blocks  xxxg1250xxx /
 xxxg19xxx ,  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a and  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b channels by
interaction with both a high-anity and a low-anity site.
the high-anity sulphonylurea site is located on the sur
subunit, while the low-anity site is likely to reside on the
 xxxg1250xxx  subunit, because it was also observed for kir6.2dc36
currents.
the ic50 for high-anity inhibition of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx 
currents by  xxxd2203xxx  was 3 nm. this value is in good
agreement with the ki for binding of [3h]- xxxd2203xxx  to
intact b-cells or b-cell membranes (0.7 to 6.8 nm: muèller et
al., 1994; schwanstecher et al., 1994). it is, however, about 10
fold higher than that observed for inhibition of whole-cell

 xxxd2203xxx  block of katp channels

197

katp currents in isolated b-cells (ic50 of 0.3 nm, schwanstecher et al., 1994), this dierence probably re¯ects
dierences in the experimental protocols. our experiments
were conducted on inside-out patches, rather than intact cells,
to avoid the complicating eects of intracellular nucleotides
on sulphonylurea inhibition. in contrast, schwanstecher et al.
(1994) preincubated b-cells with  xxxd2203xxx  and measured the
whole-cell current activated by washout of atp from the cell.
this may be advantageous when the on-rate of the drug is
slow, but may give a higher anity if  xxxd2203xxx  accumulates
inside the b-cell to a concentration higher than that in the
extracellular solution. in contrast to the experiments reported
here for katp channels in excised patches, high-anity block
by  xxxd2203xxx  was complete in whole-cell recordings from bcells, and thus low-anity inhibition was not observed
(schwanstecher et al., 1994). similar ®ndings have also been
reported for  xxxd3394xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx , and have been
attributed to the presence of intracellular mg-nucleotides
(trube et al., 1986; zuènckler et al., 1988b; gribble et al.,
1997b).
direct photoanity labelling of b-cell membrane proteins
with radiolabelled sulphonylureas revealed that  xxxd2215xxx 
binds to a 140 kda membrane protein, the sulphonylurea
receptor (aguilar-bryan et al., 1995; kramer et al., 1994). in
contrast,  xxxd2203xxx  selectively binds to a 65 kda protein
(kramer et al., 1994). both sulphonylureas are able to
displace binding of the other ligand to their respective
receptors. these results have been interpreted by kramer et
al. (1994, 1996) to indicate that the  xxxg1253xxx  complex
contains both 140 kda and 65 kda subunits, which interact
allosterically; and that  xxxd2203xxx  binds to 65 kda subunit
and  xxxd2215xxx  to the 140 kda subunit. our results
support a dierent interpretation. we observed that
 xxxd2203xxx  blocks  xxxg1250xxx /sur currents but not kir6.2dc36
currents with high anity, indicating that high-anity
inhibition requires the presence of a sulphonylurea receptor
subunit. it therefore seems probable that  xxxd2203xxx , like
 xxxd2215xxx , binds to the 140 kda sulphonylurea receptor
subunit. recent studies have shown that mild trypsinization
of  xxxg19xxx  produces a 65 kda fragment (matsuo et al., 1999).
a possible explanation of the photoanity labelling studies,
therefore, is that the sur subunit is less susceptible to
proteolysis when  xxxd2215xxx  (but not  xxxd2203xxx ) is
bound.
the responses of both  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a
currents to  xxxd2203xxx  are qualitatively similar to those
previously observed with  xxxd2215xxx , which also blocked
both  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a currents at high- and
low-anity sites. the sensitivity of the high-anity site on
 xxxg19xxx  to  xxxd2215xxx  is similar to that for  xxxd2203xxx , with
ic50s of 4.2 nm (gribble et al., 1998) and 3.0 nm,
respectively. likewise,  xxxd2203xxx  is roughly as potent as
 xxxd2215xxx  at blocking  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a currents, the ic50s
being *5 nm and *27 nm (gribble et al., 1997b; 1998), for
 xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  respectively. similar values
were reported for whole-cell native cardiac katp currents
activated by rimakalim: an ic50 of 32 nm was obtained for
 xxxd2203xxx  block and one of 7 nm for  xxxd2215xxx  block
(geisen et al., 1996). this is perhaps not surprising, given the
structural similarity of the two drugs. thus it appears that
both  xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg20xxx  possess a high-anity site for
 xxxd2203xxx .

the block of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  currents by  xxxd2203xxx , like
that of  xxxd2215xxx , is eectively irreversible in electrophysiological experiments, while block of  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a and
 xxxg1250xxx /sur2b currents is partially reversible at the lower
drug concentrations. these data are consistent with the idea
that  xxxg20xxx  does not possess a high-anity site for the
sulphonylurea moiety of  xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd2203xxx , and
that these drugs block  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg20xxx  currents primarily
through interaction with the benzamido site.
 xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  blocked kir6.2dc36 currents with ic50s of *400 mm and 42 mm, respectively,
suggesting that the low-anity site on  xxxg1250xxx  is not very
sensitive to the structural dierences between the two drugs.
when a therapeutic dose of  xxxd2203xxx  is administered
orally, the reported free plasma drug concentration is less
than 10 mm (lehr & damm, 1990; schwanstecher et al.,
1994). thus the inhibitory eect of  xxxd2203xxx  on  xxxg1250xxx  is
unlikely to be of clinical relevance and the eect of the drug
on insulin secretion is mediated entirely via the high-anity
site.
our results demonstrate that, like  xxxd2215xxx ,  xxxd2203xxx  blocks all three types of recombinant  xxxg1253xxx  with
similar anity in excised patches; and that the anity for
both drugs is similar. yet a number of studies in the
literature claim that  xxxd2203xxx  has less eect on the
electrical properties of the heart in vivo than  xxxd2215xxx 
and has led to the suggestion that  xxxd2215xxx , but not
 xxxd2203xxx , decreases `ischemic preconditioning' by blocking
 xxxg1253xxx  activation (geisen et al., 1996; klepzig et al.,
1999). the reason for the dierences between  xxxd2215xxx 

 xxxd2203xxx  block of katp channels

and  xxxd2203xxx  observed in vivo are unclear. one possibility
is that the eects of  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  on native
cardiac katp channels may not be identical in the intact cell.
it is also worth pointing out that inhibition of whole-cell
katp currents by  xxxd2203xxx  may vary between dierent
tissues, despite being identical in excised patches. in
particular, intracellular mg-nucleotides enhance the inhibitory eect of sulphonylureas in b-cells, but reduce inhibition
in cardiac muscle (zuènckler et al., 1988b; ventakesh et al.,
1991; gribble et al., 1998). this ®nding, together with the
fact that cardiac katp channels are thought to be closed
under physiological conditions and open only in response to
ischaemic stress (nichols & lederer, 1991), may help explain
why sulphonylureas have relatively few side eects on the
heart and why cardiac mortality is not dierent for diabetic
patients on insulin or sulphonylurea therapy (ukpds, 1998).
in conclusion, our results suggest that therapeutic concentrations of  xxxd2203xxx  (10 mm; lehr & damm, 1990)
block three types of recombinant  xxxg1253xxx  ±  xxxg1250xxx /
 xxxg19xxx ,  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a and  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b (corresponding to
the b-cell, cardiac and smooth muscle types of  xxxg1253xxx )
with similar anity in excised patches. they also indicate
that this inhibition is produced by interaction of the drug
with the sur subunit of the channel.
