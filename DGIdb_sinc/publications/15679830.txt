ezetimibe reduces plasma low-density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol by
blocking sterol absorption in enterocytes. the  xxxg1583xxx  gene product
was recently identified as the molecular target for ezetimibe, although
functional details are incomplete. we used the non-response phenotype
of plasma ldl cholesterol to ezetimibe treatment to ascertain
individuals who might have variant  xxxg1583xxx . we found that one nonresponder to ezetimibe was a compound heterozygote for two rare nonsynonymous polymorphisms in  xxxg1583xxx  that were absent in normal
control subjects. we also characterized other  xxxg1583xxx  polymorphisms.
while there are many explanations for non-response to medications, our
data suggest a possible relationship between  xxxg1583xxx  variation and
ezetimibe response and further indicate that a non-response phenotype
might ascertain subjects with genomic dna variants that could help
define metabolic pathways.

ezetimibe is the first member of a new class of
medications that reduces plasma low-density
lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol by blocking sterol
absorption in enterocytes (1). the  xxxg1583xxx  gene
product was recently identified to be the molecular target for ezetimibe (2), although other targets
such as the annexin 2– xxxg346xxx  complex have
also been suggested (3). while the exact function
of  xxxg1583xxx  is still being clarified (4), it is possible
that non-response to ezetimibe treatment might
be a phenotype that is related to genomic variation in  xxxg1583xxx . we thus sequenced  xxxg1583xxx 
from genomic dna of non-responders to ezetimibe treatment and normal control subjects.
subjects and methods

we evaluated 52 patients (40% females,
mean  sd age 48.7  12.3 years; 60% on combination lipid-lowering treatment) from a tertiary
referral lipid clinic who were prescribed 10 mg
ezetimibe daily for a median of 12 weeks. all
subjects provided consent for dna analysis,
and compliance with treatment was established

by pill counting. while mean (sd) plasma
ldl cholesterol fell from 4.74  1.36 to
3.65  1.09 mmol/l (mean 23.5% reduction),
eight patients had only a minimal ldl cholesterol change on ezetimibe, ranging from a 6%
decrease to a 10% increase. these eight patients
were called ‘ezetimibe non-responders’ (eze-nr).
from the genomic dna of the eight eze-nr and
six control subjects from the responder group, we
developed amplification primers using genbank
reference
sequences
nm_013389
and
nt_007819, respectively. we amplified and
bidirectionally sequenced directly the 20 exons
and intron–exon boundaries of  xxxg1583xxx  (primer
information and amplification conditions are
available upon request).
the frequency of the v55l-coding singlenucleotide polymorphism (csnp) in 278 normal
control subjects was determined using genomic
dna amplification with exon 2 primers 50 -agg

two fragments of 220 and 101 bp for the
v55-encoding allele, but only a single fragment
for the l55-coding allele. sequence-proven
control standards were run with each reaction.

history of coronary heart disease, with a target
ldl cholesterol of 2.50 mmol/l (5), and he was
intolerant of  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors. his
ldl cholesterol was 3.60 mmol/l after 12 weeks of
ezetimibe treatment. the untreated fasting lipoprotein profiles and genotypes of the proband, his
wife, and daughter are shown in fig. 1. the simple
heterozygosity for v55l in the daughter confirmed
that the proband had compound heterozygosity
for two mutations on opposite chromosomes. his
wife had neither  xxxg1583xxx  mutation. both his wife
and daughter had relatively normal lipoproteins,
which required no drug treatment based on
national guidelines (5).
the remaining synonymous and non-coding
polymorphisms that we detected by sequencing
 xxxg1583xxx  in eze-nrs and controls are summarized in table 1. we identified a total of 13 synonymous and/or non-coding polymorphisms, of
which three were represented in the national
center for biotechnology information snp database (table 1). seven polymorphisms were seen in
both eze-nrs and controls, while six polymorphisms were seen only in eze-nrs. however, minor
allele frequencies were not significantly different
between eze-nrs and controls (all p > 0.05).

results

we found that one eze-nr was a heterozygote for
two non-synonymous csnp of  xxxg1583xxx : one in
exon 2, codon 55, namely g219t,  xxxg889xxx >ttg, trivial name v55l, and one in exon 18, codon 1233,
namely t3754a, atc>aac, trivial name i1233n.
both csnps were absent from the genomic dna
of normal control subjects. the non-responsive
proband was a 77-year-old male caucasian whose
untreated baseline lipid profile values were within
10% of median values for age and sex, including a
plasma ldl cholesterol of 3.76 mmol/l. ezetimibe
treatment had been initiated because he had a

discussion

we report a subject who was a compound heterozygote for two very rare non-synonymous csnp
in  xxxg1583xxx . because this subject was ascertained
for this study through non-response of plasma
ldl cholesterol to ezetimibe treatment, it is possible that these rare csnps might be related to the
eze-nr phenotype. no functional data at present
support to the idea that a functional change
affecting variant  xxxg1583xxx  protein products
leads to the eze-nr phenotype. part of the difficulty relates to uncertainty about the precise in
vitro function to test and the most informative
assay to apply. nonetheless, indirect evidence
suggests a potential pathophysiological role for
these variants. for instance, they were absent
from the genomes of responders to ezetimibe
and normal subjects. furthermore, v55 is conserved in human and rat but not mouse  xxxg1583xxx ,
while i1233 is conserved in human and mouse
 xxxg1583xxx  but not rat  xxxg1583xxx . however, the
mouse is the least responsive animal model to
ezetimibe (6), and inference drawn from such
between-species comparisons may be less informative for  xxxg1583xxx  than for other genes and
gene products.
there are many explanations for non-response
to medications, such as interindividual variation
in compliance, absorption, activation, modification, binding, transport, degradation, and elimination. most of these mechanisms cannot be
ruled out in the eze-nr at present. furthermore,
demonstration of altered function using a direct
in vitro assay of function, such as reduced interaction between ezetimibe and variant  xxxg1583xxx ,
would be required to directly link the nonresponse phenotype to the dna changes. nonetheless, our results suggest a possible relationship

between  xxxg1583xxx  variation and ezetimibe
response and suggest that  xxxg1583xxx  might indeed
be the target for ezetimibe. furthermore, the
results indicate that non-responsiveness to a
pharmacological agent might be a useful strategy
to ascertain subjects for detecting genomic dna
variants that could further characterize metabolic
pathways.
