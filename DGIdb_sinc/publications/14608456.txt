abstract the beta-blocker (-)- xxxd2957xxx  produces intrinsic
sympathomimetic activity manifested clinically by cardiostimulation, but the beta-adrenoceptor subtype, which mediates these effects, is unknown. recent work indicates the
existence of a (-)-propranolol-resistant site of the cardiac
 xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor and we propose that it mediates the cardiostimulation evoked by (-)- xxxd2957xxx . we compared the
interaction of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  both with human atrial myocardium and with recombinant  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors. the effects of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  on paced human atrial trabeculae were
studied in the presence of  xxxd2388xxx 
( xxxd2388xxx ; 20 µm). (-)- xxxd2957xxx  caused small negative and
positive inotropic effects at nanomolar and micromolar
concentrations respectively, which were unaffected by
 xxxd3291xxx  ( xxxd3291xxx , 10 µm), inconsistent with an involvement of  xxxd2738xxx . (-)- xxxd2957xxx ,
in the presence of (-)-propranolol, increased atrial contractile force and camp through recombinant  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors with identical potency (–logec50m=6.5). the positive inotropic effects of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  were resistant to blockade by l-748,337 (100 nm), a  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptor antagonist.
(-)-cgp12177, known to act through the (-)-propranololresistant site of the  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor, also increased with similar potency atrial contractile force (–logec50m=7.6) and
camp at recombinant  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors (–logec50m=7.7).
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  blocked the effects of (-)-cgp12177 in human atrium and recombinant  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors with similar equilibrium dissociation constants (pkb=6.5 and 6.3).

thus, stimulant potency and blocking potency of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  against (-)-cgp12177 agree. in contrast, (-)- xxxd2957xxx 
was 200–400 times more effective at blocking the effects
of a catecholamine than the effects of (-)-cgp12177 in
both human atrium (pkb=9.1) and at recombinant  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors (pkb=8.6).
we conclude that the cardiostimulant effects of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  in human atrial myocardium are mediated through a
(-)-propranolol-resistant site of the  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor with
low affinity for (-)- xxxd2957xxx . in contrast, (-)- xxxd2957xxx  blocks
the effects of catecholamines through a high-affinity site
of the  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor.  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptors are not involved
in the atrial effects of (-)- xxxd2957xxx .

introduction
both  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors mediate cardiostimulation
evoked by catecholamines, which is preventable by beta-blockers. in addition to antagonizing cardiostimulant effects of
catecholamines, some beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, exemplified by  xxxd2957xxx , possess cardiostimulant effects in several species (kaumann and blinks
1980; walter et al. 1984) including man (man in’t veld
and schalekamp 1981). the cardiostimulant property of
 xxxd2957xxx  has been reported to be beneficial for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension (man in’t veld and schalekamp 1981) and neurocardiogenic syncope (iskos et al
1998; benditt et al. 1999) but the receptor mechanism is
unknown.
beta-blockers with cardiostimulant effects are partial agonists and two modes of action have been disclosed (kaumann 1989). conventional partial agonists produce cardiostimulation proportional to their beta-adrenoceptor occupancy (kaumann 1989). non-conventional partial agonists (e.g., (-)- xxxd2957xxx , (-)-cgp12177), on the other hand,
only produce cardiostimulation at concentrations consid-

497

erably greater than those that block the effects of catecholamines (kaumann 1989). the cardiostimulant effects
of non-conventional partial agonists, unlike conventional
partial agonists, are resistant to blockade by propranolol.
 xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptor-mediated effects are also resistant to
propranolol (kaumann 1989), but the cardiostimulant effects of (-)-cgp12177 persist in  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptor knockout mice, ruling out mediation through  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptors
(kaumann et al. 1998). instead, a  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor mechanism was supported by data showing that cgp12177 enhanced camp in cells transfected with recombinant
 xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors (pak and fishman 1996; konkar et al.
2000). a definitive role of  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors was established after it was shown that (-)-cgp12177 does not
cause cardiostimulant effects in double- xxxg836xxx / xxxg92xxx  knockout mice, but does in  xxxg92xxx  knockout
mice (kaumann et al. 2001).
 xxxd2957xxx  is a non-conventional partial agonist in animal models because it causes cardiostimulation at concentrations considerably greater than those that block  xxxg836xxx - and
 xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors (kaumann and blinks 1980; walter et
al. 1984; kaumann 1989; kaumann and lobnig 1986).
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  failed to enhance contractile force of isolated
human atrial myocardium (kaumann and lobnig 1986), a
tissue often used as a model for human cardiac beta-adrenoceptors (gille et al. 1985; kaumann 1996; molenaar et al.
2002; sarsero et al. 2003) but potently antagonized the effects of noradrenaline mediated through  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors
(kaumann and lobnig 1986). we now report conditions
under which (-)- xxxd2957xxx  does increase human atrial contractile force and also studied the effects of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  in
recombinant  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors, expressed in cho cells at
physiological density. in both systems (-)- xxxd2957xxx  caused
quantitatively similar agonist effects resistant to (-)-propranolol blockade.

methods
patients. this study was approved by the prince charles hospital
human ethics committee (ec9876). right atrial appendages were
obtained from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.
written informed consent was obtained from 34 patients (29/5
male/female age, 61±10 [±sd]). medications included beta-blockers
(atenolol/metoprolol, number of patients 33), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (7), l-type ca2+ inhibitors (13), nitrates (28),
hypolipidemics (27), hypoglycemics (3) and diuretics (2).
patients were not selected on the basis of ser49gly- or
gly389arg- xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor polymorphisms because we have shown
these not to affect cardiostimulant responses for (-)-noradrenaline
or (-)-cgp12177 in right atrium (molenaar et al. 2002; sarsero et
al. 2003; but see sandilands et al. 2003).
isolated atria. right atrial trabeculae were prepared and set up to
contract at 1 hz at 37°c as described (gille et al. 1985). after a
20 min exposure to 20 µm  xxxd2388xxx , a single cumulative concentrationeffect curve to (-)- xxxd2957xxx  was determined, followed by the addition of 6 µm (-)-cgp12177 and finally 600 µm (-)- xxxd2398xxx .
the effects of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  were further investigated in the presence of 200 nm (-)-propranolol and 20 µm  xxxd2388xxx  in which a single cumulative concentration-effect curve to (-)- xxxd2957xxx  up to 6 µm
was determined, followed by a curve for (-)-cgp12177 in the
presence of 6 µm (-)- xxxd2957xxx . for 5 of 8 patients, a curve for
(-)-cgp12177 was also determined on another trabeculum from

the same atrium in the presence of both (-)-propranolol and  xxxd2388xxx .
the experiments were concluded by the administration of (-)- xxxd2398xxx  (600 µm). the –log (molar concentration) of (-)- xxxd2957xxx 
and (-)-cgp12177 producing half-maximal increases in contractile
force (–logec50m) were determined. an estimate of the affinity of
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  (–log dissociation equilibrium constant kb,m = pkb)
for the  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor site activated by (-)-cgp12177, was calculated from –logec50 values for (-)-cgp12177 in the presence
and absence of (-)- xxxd2957xxx , using the law of propagation of errors
(kaumann 1990).
to investigate whether  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptors contribute to the effects of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  (gauthier et al. 1998) in human atrium two
sets of experiments were carried out. firstly, the ability of the
 xxxd2738xxx -synthase inhibitor  xxxd3291xxx  to abrogate possible
 xxxg838xxx -adrenenoceptor-mediated negative inotropic effects (gauthier
et al. 1998) was determined. secondly, the cardiostimulant effects
of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  were determined in the absence or presence of the
selective human  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptor antagonist l-748,337 (candelore
et al. 1999).
to investigate the ability of (-)-cgp12177 to block the cardiostimulant effects of the  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor activated by (-)-noradrenaline, trabeculae were incubated with phenoxybenzamine (5 µm,
90 min incubation followed by washout) to irreversibly block
 xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenoceptors, neuronal- and extra-neuronal uptake (gille et al.
1985) and 50nm ici118,551 to block  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors (molenaar
et al. 2002). concentration-effect curves were determined to
(-)-cgp12177 up to 60 nm and sequentially to (-)-noradrenaline.
in paired trabeculae from the same patient, concentration-effect
curves were established to (-)-noradrenaline in the absence of
(-)-cgp12177. the affinity of (-)-cgp12177 was then determined
from –logec50 values for (-)-noradrenaline in the absence and
presence of (-)-cgp12177.
generation of arg389beta1-adrenoceptors expressed in cho cells. a
2.4 kb full length cdna of the human  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor, was cloned
into the ecori/kpni site of the vector pcdna3, (a gift from dr
graeme milligan, university of glasgow, uk). when sequenced,
the insert was found to consist of the arginine389 polymorphic variant (mason et al. 1999). the  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptorarg389 cdna was
cloned into the pbi-l plasmid (clontech), which also contains a
luciferase reporter gene regulated from a tetracycline response element to allow surrogate monitoring of  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor gene expression. the pbi-l  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptorarg389 plasmid was co-transfected with a ptk-hyg vector into the cho-aa8 cell line (gossen
and bujard 1992) and stable hygromycin-resistant cell lines were
selected. a clone with a  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor density of 81 fmol/mg protein, assessed with (-)-[125i]-cyanopindolol binding, similar to that
found in normal human atrium (sarsero et al. 2003), was used for
receptor binding and camp assays.
receptor binding assays. cho cells, stored at –80°c in 1 mm
edta, 25 mm tris. hcl, ph 7.4 (20°c) were thawed and pelleted
for 30 min at 17,000 × g, 4°c, and then homogenized by polytron
(7 mm probe, 3×10 s, speed setting 8) in a binding buffer containing (mm): egta 5, edta 1, mgcl2 4,  xxxd228xxx  1, phenylmethyl-sulfonyl fluoride 0.5, tris-hcl 50, ph 7.5 (37°c). for receptor saturation assays, homogenates were incubated for 2 h at
37°c in a final volume of 0.5 ml (10 µg protein) with 1–200 pm
(-)-[125i]-cyanopindolol. non-specific binding was defined as
binding not removed with 200 µm (-)- xxxd2398xxx . bound radioligand was isolated by filtration through whatman gf/b paper and
radioactivity counted. to estimate the affinity of (-)- xxxd2957xxx ,
(-)-cgp12177 and (-)-propranolol for the  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor, cell
membranes were labeled with ~30 pm (-)-[125i]-cyanopindolol in
the absence and presence of concentrations (0.03 nm–100 µm) of
competing ligand. saturation binding assays and binding inhibition
data were analyzed with non-linear regression and dissociation
equilibrium constants calculated from saturation assays (kd) and
binding inhibition assays (ki).
camp assays in cho cells. cho cells were grown to 70% confluence in 24 well cluster plates containing minimum essential
medium (alpha modification) and 100 µg/ml each of  xxxg418xxx  and hy-

statistics. all effects are expressed as mean±sem of n patients or
assays. a repeated measures anova with one factor was used to
analyze experiments with increasing concentrations of (-)- xxxd2957xxx 
(+ xxxd2388xxx , fig. 1). eight successive (-)- xxxd2957xxx  log concentrations
constituted the repeated measure with the factor being  xxxd3291xxx 
at two levels (0 (e) and 10 µm (t)).
repeated measures anova with one factor was used to analyze experiments with increasing concentrations of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  in
the presence of (-)-propranolol (+ xxxd2388xxx ; fig. 2). in this case the
two levels of the factor were the drug  xxxd2957xxx  (black triangles) or
 xxxd2957xxx +100 nm l-748,337 (white triangles). comparisons of
successive drug concentrations were assessed using tukey-kramer
multiple comparisons. student’s t-tests were used to test differences between two groups of data, such as comparing the effects of
single (maximal) concentrations of (-)-cgp12177 versus the effect
caused by the highest concentration of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  tested (6 µm,
figs. 1, 2).

intrinsic activity was determined against a maximal effect of (-)- xxxd2398xxx 

drugs. (-)-cgp12177 [(-)-4-(3-tertiarybutylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy) benzimidazol-2-one)] was a gift from dr jonathan arch
(glaxosmithkline, harlow, uk), l-748,337 n-(3-[3-[2-(4-benzenesulphonylaminophenyl)ethylamino]-2-hydroxypropoxy]benzyl) xxxd63xxx  was a gift from dr mari rios candelore (merck
research laboratories, new jersey, usa), (-)- xxxd2957xxx  was from
tocris (ellisville, usa),  xxxd2388xxx , (-)-propranolol,  xxxd3291xxx , (-)-noradrenaline and (-)- xxxd2398xxx  hydrochloride were from sigma
(castle hill, australia).

to determine whether  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptors contributed to
the cardiostimulant effects of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  as previously
observed for the selective human  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptor agonist
l-755,507 in mice with cardiac-specific overexpression
of human  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptors (kohout et al. 2001), we investigated the ability of the selective human  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptor antagonist l-748,337 (candelore et al. 1999) to
block the effects of (-)- xxxd2957xxx . l-748,337 100 nm, a
concentration predicted to occupy ~96% of human  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptors (candelore et al. 1999) did not modify the
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  effects (p>0.05, fig. 2a).
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  blocks with high affinity (-)-noradrenaline
responses mediated through  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors in human atrial
myocardium (kaumann and lobnig 1986). (-)-cgp12177
also blocked with high affinity the effects of (-)-noradrenaline (fig. 3). as observed previously (kaumann 1996),
(-)-cgp12177 up to 60 nm produced negative inotropic
effects but also caused marked antagonism by shifting the
concentration-effect curve for (-)-noradrenaline rightwards
by nearly 3-log units (figure 3).

results
isolated atria
the sequential addition of increasing concentrations of
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  to human atrial trabeculae, pre-equilibrated with
20 µm  xxxd2388xxx , reduced contractile force (p<0.001) followed by an increase at higher concentrations (p<0.001,
n=9, fig. 1). (-)-cgp12177 (6 µm) caused a further increase (p=0.0002) in force (49.6±14.2% of the maximal
effect of (-)- xxxd2398xxx ) in the presence of (-)- xxxd2957xxx 
(6 µm). the effects of  xxxd2388xxx , (-)- xxxd2957xxx  and (-)-cgp12177
were unaffected by  xxxd3291xxx  (p>0.05,fig. 1).
in the presence of (-)-propranolol and  xxxd2388xxx , (-)- xxxd2957xxx  caused concentration-dependent increases in contractile force (p<0.0001) with tendencies for increases at
20–60 nm which became significant at concentrations
greater than 60 nm (fig. 2a, b). (-)- xxxd2957xxx  hastened the
time to reach peak force and the half time to relaxation
(t50, p<0.0001 both effects, fig. 2b, c) with significant reductions at concentrations greater than 20 nm. the sequential addition of 6 µm (-)-cgp12177 further increased
contractile force (p<0.0001) and hastened relaxation (time
to peak force p<0.0001, t50 p<0.05, all statistics for 6 µm
(-)-cgp12177 (force, %(-)- xxxd2398xxx  74.4±3.5) vs. 6 µm
(-)- xxxd2957xxx , paired student’s t-test).
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  blocked the effects of (-)-cgp12177 by
causing a rightward shift of the concentration-effect curve
for (-)-cgp12177 (figure 2a) with pkb=6.4 (table 1).
because the pkb estimate did not differ significantly from
the –logec50 (6.5, p=0.4) for the increase in contractile
force by (-)- xxxd2957xxx  (table 1), the concentration-effect curve
for (-)- xxxd2957xxx  was fitted with the mass law action curve of
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  for the receptor site activated by (-)-cgp12177
(fig. 2a).

(figs. 4, 5). (-)- xxxd2957xxx - and (-)-cgp12177-stimulated

discussion
it has been suggested previously (kaumann 1989) that the
(-)- xxxd2957xxx -evoked tachycardia observed in man (man in’t
veld and schalekamp 1981; man in’t veld et al. 1982;
iskos et al. 1998; benditt et al. 1999) is mediated through an
atypical beta-adrenoceptor. our results support the hypothesis
that (-)- xxxd2957xxx  acts as a cardiostimulant through a (-)-propranolol-resistant site of the  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor because:

501

1. (-)- xxxd2957xxx  increased with identical potency both
atrial force and camp levels through recombinant
 xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors in the presence of (-)-propranolol and
 xxxd2388xxx 
2. (-)- xxxd2957xxx  antagonized similarly the stimulant effects
of (-)-cgp12177 on atrial force and camp levels in
cho cells expressing recombinant  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors. the
blocking potency of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  against (-)-cgp12177
matched its stimulant potency (pkb≈-logec50, table 1)
in both systems. because (-)-cgp12177 acts through a
(-)-propranolol-resistant site of the  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor
(konkar et al. 2000; kaumann 2000; granneman 2001),
this quantitative agreement supports the proposal that
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  not only acts through this site but also
competes with (-)-cgp12177 for it.
at variance with our evidence, baker et al. (2003) reported
very recently that  xxxd2957xxx  acts as an agonist through two
sites at  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors, one with high affinity and the
other with low affinity. our evidence is consistent with
the hypothesis that (-)- xxxd2957xxx  only causes agonist effects
through activation of the low affinity site at both recombinant  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors and human atrium. reasons for the
different results are not known. unfortunately, it is not
clear whether baker et al. (2003) used racemic  xxxd2957xxx  or
the (-)- xxxd2957xxx  isomer. furthermore, it is also unknown
which polymorphic variant was used in the study of baker
et al. (2003).
we also demonstrated for both (-)- xxxd2957xxx  and (-)-propranolol, high-affinity binding at, and blockade of recombinant  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors. these nanomolar affinity estimates are in agreement with previous affinity estimates
from human atrium for both (-)- xxxd2957xxx  (kaumann and
lobnig 1986) and (-)-propranolol (gille et al. 1985). the
subnanomolar affinity binding of (-)-cgp12177, which
we estimated for recombinant  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors, agrees with
a similar high affinity estimate (kb=0.2 nm) obtained from
blockade of the positive inotropic effects of (-)-noradrenaline by (-)-cgp12177 in human right atrium. taken together, this evidence is consistent both in atrium and cho
cells with blockade of catecholamine effects by (-)- xxxd2957xxx , (-)-propranolol and (-)-cgp12177 through a  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor site for which these antagonists have high
affinity. a second site of the  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor, for which the
3 beta-blockers have an affinity approximately 200–400 times
lower than for the high affinity site, is only activated to
mediate cardiostimulation by (-)- xxxd2957xxx  and (-)-cgp12177
but not (-)-propranolol.
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  not only increased atrial contractile force
but also hastened relaxation, consistent with a camp-dependent phosphorylation of phospholamban and troponin i,
observed to occur through beta-adrenoceptor stimulation in
human atrium (kaumann et al. 1996; sarsero et al. 2003).
the increases of camp through  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors in cho
cells, produced by (-)- xxxd2957xxx  and (-)-cgp12177, are
consistent with activation of a camp pathway. however,
the intrinsic activities of the two agents in cho cells are
lower, relative to the effects of (-)- xxxd2398xxx , than the
corresponding intrinsic activities on atrial contractile force

(table 1). this discrepancy is probably related to the more
physiological coupling of the (-)-propranolol-resistant receptor site to the camp pathway in the native atrial cell
environment than in the cho cells hosting  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors.
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  can elicit tachycardia, resistant to blockade by propranolol, as observed in anaesthetized dogs and
in a patient with dysautonomia and undetectable plasma
noradrenaline (clark et al. 1982). the magnitude of tachycardia may depend on pathology, as for example conditions with low (-)-noradrenaline levels and consequent
“supersensitivity” favoring the observation of tachycardia
(man in’t veld and schalekamp 1981; man in’t et al.
1982). our model of in vitro human right atrium relied on
the use of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor to reveal positive
inotropic effects to (-)- xxxd2957xxx , indicating these were not
as strong as those of (-)-cgp12177 (this study; kaumann
1996; sarsero et al. 2003) or (-)-noradrenaline (this study;
molenaar et al. 2002).
it must, however, be taken into account that clinically
used  xxxd2957xxx  is the racemate, containing equal proportions of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  and (+)- xxxd2957xxx  (kaumann 1989).
(+)- xxxd2957xxx  has been found to bind selectively to cardiac
 xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors in feline ventricular membranes (morris
and kaumann 1984) and to elicit sinoatrial tachycardia in
guinea pig mediated through  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors (walter et
al. 1984). it is unlikely that racemic  xxxd2957xxx  produces
tachycardia through interaction of its (+)-enantiomer with
human sinoatrial  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors because the tachycardia of racemic  xxxd2957xxx  in the dog is not blocked by propranolol (clark et al. 1982). although  xxxd2957xxx  has been
shown to produce small elevations of camp through  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors of s49 cells primed with  xxxd1742xxx  (jasper et
al. 1990), these effects are antagonized by propranolol
with hardly any dissociation between stimulant potencies
and affinities estimated both from binding and antagonism (jasper et al. 1990).  xxxd2957xxx  has also been reported
to bind to recombinant  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors with a 40 times
higher affinity (ballesteros et al. 2001) than the affinity
estimated by us for recombinant  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors, pointing to a different interaction mode of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  with the
two subtypes. taken together these considerations make it
unlikely that  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors are involved in pindololevoked cardiostimulation in man.
for a variety of reasons it is also unlikely that  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptors are involved in the cardiostimulant effects of
(-)- xxxd2957xxx . the  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptor has been reported to
mediate cardiodepressant effects through a  xxxd2738xxx 
(no)-dependent pathway in human ventricular preparations
(gauthier et al. 1998). our experiments with  xxxd3291xxx  are
inconsistent with an involvement of no and  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptors in the effects of both (-)- xxxd2957xxx  and (-)-cgp12177.
the  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptor has been found to enhance cardiac
contractility only when overexpressed in the hearts of
transgenic mice (kohout et al. 2001). we found that the
 xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptor selective blocker, l-748,337 (candelore
et al. 1999) had no effect on the positive inotropic effects
of (-)- xxxd2957xxx .  xxxd2957xxx  is also a partial agonist with
lower intrinsic activity than the typical  xxxg838xxx -selective ago-

502

nist brl37344 on recombinant  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptors expressed at high density in cho cells (emorine et al.
1989). unlike the affinity estimated for the low-affinity
site of the  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor (kb=300–500 nm, this work),
the affinity of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  for recombinant  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptors is considerably higher (ki=11 nm) (emorine et al.
1989). in contrast to our results with  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors, in
which low micromolar and nanomolar concentrations of
(-)- xxxd2957xxx  antagonize the effects of (-)-cgp12177 and
(-)- xxxd2398xxx , respectively, 100 µm  xxxd2957xxx  did not
block the  xxxd2398xxx  effects on recombinant  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptors (emorine et al. 1989).
unbound plasma concentrations of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  obtained following therapeutic administration of racemic
(±)- xxxd2957xxx  would be expected to partially occupy the
low affinity site of the  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor. we calculate that
concentrations of 60–120 nm are reached following the
oral administration of one 15 mg (gross et al. 2001) or
2×10 mg  xxxd2957xxx  tablets, respectively (hsyu and giacomini 1985), sufficient to evoke direct cardiostimulant effects. stronger effects would be even more likely to occur
with higher doses (45 mg/day) used therapeutically. we
speculate that 60–120 nm of plasma (-)- xxxd2957xxx  would in
particular cause significant increases in nocturnal sinoatrial heart rate when parasympathetic nerve activity is
high while sympathetic nerve activity is quiescent (van de
borne et al. 1994; vanolie et al. 1995). nocturnally, the
bradycardic effects of (-)- xxxd2957xxx  will be reduced due to
negligible interaction with endogenous catecholamines.
consistent with this idea,  xxxd2957xxx  induced increases in
heart rate are higher at night (fitscha et al. 1982; kantelip
et al. 1984; channer et al. 1994).
we conclude that the dissociation between blockade
and stimulation, previously observed with (-)- xxxd2957xxx  in
vitro in isolated myocardium of several species, has been
confirmed both in human atrium and recombinant  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors. (-)- xxxd2957xxx  exerts intrinsic sympathomimetic
activity through a (-)-propranolol-resistant low-affinity receptor site, and blockade of the effects of catecholamines
through a high-affinity  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor site. we propose
that the low-affinity  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor site mediates the tachycardia caused by racemic  xxxd2957xxx .
