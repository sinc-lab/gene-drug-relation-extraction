abstract

purpose: the majority of gastrointestinal stromal tumors harbor mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinases kitor platelet-derived growth factor receptora ( xxxg1709xxx ), and respond to treatment
with the  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor imatinib. some tumors, however, show primary resistance to
imatinib treatment, and most others become resistant during treatment.the most common mechanism of imatinib resistance involves specific mutations in the kinase domains of kitor  xxxg1709xxx .
we tested the activity of  xxxd3264xxx , an orally active small-molecule  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor, to
inhibit important imatinib-resistant kitand  xxxg1709xxx  mutants.
experimental design: primary imatinib-resistant tumor cells and cell lines expressing clinically
identified imatinib-resistant kit-v654a, kit-t670i, or  xxxg1709xxx -d842v mutant isoforms were
evaluated for sensitivity to  xxxd3264xxx  by western immunoblotting and proliferation assays. three
patients with the kit-v654a mutation were treated with  xxxd3264xxx .
results: based on ex vivo assays,  xxxd3264xxx  potently inhibits kit kinase activity of v654a and
t670i mutants and suppresses proliferation of the cells expressing these mutations. sensitivity
of kit-v654a and kit-t670i mutants to  xxxd3264xxx  was confirmed using cell lines expressing these
mutants. in contrast,  xxxd3264xxx  did not potently inhibit the  xxxg1709xxx -d842v mutant. in agreement
with these results, two of the three imatinib-resistant patients with the kit-v654a mutation
responded to  xxxd3264xxx  treatment.
conclusions: these studies suggest that  xxxd3264xxx  may be a useful therapeutic agent to treat
gastrointestinal stromal tumors harboring the imatinib-resistant kit-v654a or kit-t670i mutations, but it has no effect on the activity of the  xxxg1709xxx -d842v mutant. specific kinase inhibitors
should be designed to inhibit the constitutive activating  xxxg1709xxx  mutation at codon 842.

 xxxd2333xxx  (gleevec, sti571; novartis, basel, switzerland), a  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor with activity against  xxxg23xxx 
(abl),  xxxg24xxx  (arg), kit, platelet-derived growth factor receptor a
( xxxg1709xxx ), and pdgfrh, is effectively used for the treatment of
patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic eosinophilic leukemia, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (gist; refs.
1 – 4). despite good responses to imatinib in most patients,
primary and acquired resistance to the drug does occur in these
diseases and forms a new major problem for targeted therapies.
gists that show primary resistance to imatinib either carry
no mutations in kit or  xxxg1709xxx , or carry specific activation
loop mutations in kit or  xxxg1709xxx , including the pdgfrad842v mutation (5 – 7). we and others have shown that the

most important mechanism for acquired resistance to imatinib
is the reactivation of kit, which occurs via secondary gene
mutations in the kit kinase domain, including the mutations
val654ala and thr670ile (8 – 11). an understanding of the
mechanism of imatinib resistance has prompted the search for
alternative kit and  xxxg1709xxx  inhibitors that are effective against
imatinib-resistant mutants (10).  xxxd3264xxx  is an orally active
inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, with selectivity
for pdgfr,  xxxg2413xxx  receptor,  xxxg801xxx ,
and kit (12, 13). it therefore exhibits direct antitumor effects
against tumors depending on signaling through pdgfr,  xxxg801xxx ,
and kit, in addition to antiangiogenic activity through its
potent inhibition of  xxxg2413xxx

 xxxd3264xxx  inhibits imatinib-resistant kit mutants

receptor. in vitro,  xxxd3264xxx  inhibits these targets with ic50
values in the low nanomolar range (14).
a clinical phase iii randomized trial of  xxxd3264xxx  in gist
patients who became resistant to imatinib showed clinical
activity in resistant tumors and a statistically significant
improvement in both time to progression and overall survival
in patients treated with  xxxd3264xxx  versus placebo (12). preliminary positron emission tomography analysis showed
that  xxxd3264xxx  shrank tumors in 8% of patients while stabilizing the disease in 60%, giving an overall response rate of
68%. the gist genotype was determined in 47 patients, and
a total of 79%, 33%, 50%, and 100% of patients with
kit exon 9 mutants, kit exon 11 mutants, no detectable
mutations, and  xxxg1709xxx  mutants, respectively, showed
clinical benefit. however, data regarding the ability of
 xxxd3264xxx  to inhibit specific imatinib-resistant mutants are
not available. given that knowledge of the sensitivity of a
particular mutant could assist in determining whether
 xxxd3264xxx  would be appropriate for a particular patient or
not, we tested the effect of  xxxd3264xxx  on the most common
imatinib-resistant mutants, kit-v654a, kit-t670i, and
 xxxg1709xxx -d842v.

materials and methods
patients. progressive tumors from three patients treated with
imatinib were evaluated. all three tumors expressed the acquired
imatinib-resistant mutation v654a. patient characteristics and clinical
data of two of these patients were described previously (cases 10 and
19; ref. 10). the third patient was a 57-year-old male who progressed
after 30 months of imatinib treatment. his progressive tumor, which
was partially removed, expressed the primary kit(delwk557-558) and
secondary kit-v654a mutation. during the next 5 months, the
remaining tumor started to grow again. these three patients were
enrolled in a trial of  xxxd3264xxx  and were treated with  xxxd3264xxx  until
progression (response evaluation criteria in solid tumors; ref. 15).
the study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review
board.
primary tumor cells. gist cells were obtained by tumor biopsy
from three patients refractory to imatinib treatment in the
department of clinical oncology at university hospital leuven.
patients’ clinical characteristics, histopathologic findings, and tumor
genomic primary and progressive features are detailed elsewhere
(cases no. 11, 14, and 19; ref. 10). all three tumors expressed
acquired imatinib-resistant kit mutations, either v654a or t670i, in
addition to the primary kit exon 9 or 11 activating mutations,
which were identified based on mutational analysis of imatinibnontreated tumor specimens. thus, tested tumor cells harbored
kit(del557-558)/t670i, kit(ins503ay)/v654a, or kit(ins574pt)/
v654a mutant isoforms.
in addition, primary gist cells from the sporadic, high-risk gist
(bearing kitdel557-558 mutation), which was obtained from the
biopsy of imatinib-naı̈ve patient, and imatinib-sensitive gist882 cell
line, which exhibits constitutive kinase activity due to hemizygous kit
k642e missense mutation (16) were tested as a control.
primary gist cells were obtained form collagenase-disaggregated
tumor specimens, seeded in 25 mm cell culture dishes (corning, inc.,
corning, ny) and grown in dmem supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, 1 mmol/l nonessential amino acids, 1.0 mmol/l
sodium pyruvate, and 0.5 mmol/l  xxxd2388xxx  for
inhibition of fibroblast growth until 90% confluence. control,
imatinib-sensitive gist882 cell line was grown using the same medium
as for primary gist cells but without  xxxd2388xxx 
supplement.

progressive and the control primary gist cells and the control
imatinib-sensitive gist882 cell line were tested for their response to
the inhibitor after short-term culture by western immunoassay. cells
were treated with various concentrations of dmso alone or with
 xxxd3264xxx  in dmso to a range of doses (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 5 amol/l
for primary gist cells, and 0.001, 0.025 and 0.5 amol/l for gist882
cells) for 90 minutes at room temperature. after treatment, cells were
washed with ice-cold pbs and scraped into lyses buffer (20 mmol/l
tris-hcl, 1% triton x-100, 5 mmol/l edta, 150 mmol/l nacl,
1 mmol/l na3vo4, and a protease inhibitor cocktail). lysates were
incubated for 30 minutes at 4jc and then centrifuged for 20 minutes.
supernatants were removed and used for sds gel electrophoresis and
immunoblotting as described previously (17). membranes (amersham
pharmacia biotechnology, cambridge, united kingdom) were immunoblotted overnight using anti-phospho-kit (y703; zymed, san
francisco, ca; dilution 1:250). horseradish peroxidase – conjugated
antirabbit immunoglobulin was used as secondary antibody (dilution
1:2,500) and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (pierce,
rockford, il). membranes were then stripped and reblotted to
determine total protein levels using total kit-antibody (dilution
1:500, anti- xxxg1279xxx , a4506; dako, glostrup, denmark).
the effect of  xxxd3264xxx  on cell proliferation of primary gists cells
and gist882 cell line was evaluated by ki-67 immunostaining assay.
cells (1  104) were seeded in eight-well chamber slides and grown in
dmem (supplemented as above) for 72 hours in triplicate. then, cells
were incubated with various concentrations of  xxxd3264xxx  for 72 hours.
the proliferation index was determined by immunostaining using
human anti-ki67 antibody (dilution 1:200; dako) in drug-treated
slides relative to no-drug controls.
inhibitors and constructs.  xxxd3264xxx  was provided by pfizer (la jolla,
ca). a 10 mmol/l stock solution of  xxxd3264xxx  was prepared in dmso
and was stored at 20jc. for experiments, dilutions of the stock
solution were made in cell culture medium with the final dmso
concentration maximum 0.1%.  xxxg1709xxx  and kit expression constructs
were described previously (10).
ba/f3 cell growth assay and western blot analysis. ba/f3 cells stably
expressing the different constructs were grown in rpmi 1640
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously
(10). for dose-response curves, ba/f3 cells were grown in 24-well
plates with different concentrations of inhibitor. the number of
viable cells was determined at the start and after 24 hours, using the
aqueousone solution (promega, mannheim, germany). the effect
of  xxxd3264xxx  on kit or  xxxg1709xxx  autophosphorylation of ba/f3 cells
exposed to varying concentrations of  xxxd3264xxx  for 90 minutes was
evaluated by western blot analysis, as previously described (18). the
antibodies used were anti-phospho- xxxg1709xxx  and anti- xxxg1709xxx 
(santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca).

ex vivo response of imatinib resistant gists mutants to
 xxxd3264xxx . to determine the efficacy of  xxxd3264xxx  to inhibit the
imatinib-resistant t670i and v654a mutants of kit, we
established ex vivo cultures of gist cells obtained from tumors
expressing kit(delwk557-558)/t670i, kit(ins503ay)/v654a,
and kit(ins574pt)/v654a mutants. the kit protein was
expressed and phosphorylated in all imatinib-resistant gist cells
propagated ex vivo as well as in the control imatinib-naı̈ve gist
harboring kit(del557-558) mutation and a control gist882 cell
line, which express an activating kit(k642e) mutant (fig. 1).
the effect of  xxxd3264xxx  on the autophosphorylation of the
kit y703 residue in cultured imatinib-resistant gist cells and
imatinib-sensitive control gist cells was determined by
western blot. observations were standardized for total kit
expression using anti-kit antibody based on densitometric

quantification of autoradiographic signals (supplementary
table s1). kit autophosphorylation was totally inhibited by
 xxxd3264xxx  at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 amol/l in
imatinib-resistant gist cells that carry v654a mutations, and
significantly or totally inhibited at concentrations of 1.0 and
5.0 amol/l in cells harboring the t670i mutation, respectively.
in imatinib-sensitive gist882 cells, kit activation was significantly reduced by  xxxd3264xxx  already  xxxd1891xxx  nmol/l concentration and completely inhibited at 50 nmol/l concentration of
the drug. in imatinib-naı̈ve, control primary gist cells, kit
activation was totally inhibited already  xxxd1891xxx  nmol/l concentration of the drug.
the antiproliferative effect of  xxxd3264xxx  was determined by
immunostaining of cultured imatinib-resistant gist cells and
gist882 cells with anti-ki-67 antibody. as shown in fig. 1, the

fraction of proliferating cells in all tested gist cultures
decreased up to 3-fold and in a dose-dependent manner after
treatment with  xxxd3264xxx  for 3 days. after treatment with
1 amol/l  xxxd3264xxx , the proliferation rate of imatinib-resistant
kit(ins503ay)/v654a and kit(ins574pt)/v654a mutants
decreased to 35% and 55%, and that of the kit(delwk557558)/t670i mutant to 64%, compared with nontreated cells.
treatment of imatinib-sensitive gist882 cells with  xxxd3264xxx 
inhibited the proliferation with 31% compared with nontreated
cells already at 50 nmol/l  xxxd3264xxx . treatment of imatinibnaı̈ve gist with  xxxd3264xxx  resulted in complete cell proliferation arrest already  xxxd1891xxx  nmol/l concentration of the drug.

expressing these mutants became growth factor independent
and totally dependent on the kinase activity of the kit or
 xxxg1709xxx  mutants for their growth and survival. we have
previously shown that the ba/f3 cells expressing these constructs are resistant to imatinib (10). in the current experiments,
the growth of ba/f3 cells expressing kit(delwk557-558)/
v654a or kit(delwk557-558)/t670i was completely inhibited
by  xxxd3264xxx  at concentrations below 500 nmol/l (cellular ic50
50-100 nmol/l). the direct effect of  xxxd3264xxx  on these kinases
was confirmed by analysis of their phosphorylation state by
western blot analysis using a phosphospecific antibody (fig. 2).
the growth of ba/f3 cells expressing the  xxxg1709xxx -d842v
mutant was less sensitive to  xxxd3264xxx  and was completely
inhibited at 5 amol/l. analysis of the phosphorylation state of
 xxxg1709xxx -d842v mutant, however, showed resistance to

 xxxd3264xxx , with phosphorylation not completely inhibited even
at a drug concentration up to 5.0 amol/l (fig. 2). these results
indicate that the  xxxg1709xxx -d842v mutant is resistant to
 xxxd3264xxx . the observed growth inhibition of the ba/f3 cells is
likely due to off-target effects of  xxxd3264xxx  in these cells as has
also been observed for other small-molecule inhibitors (19).

in vitro results, three gist patients whose tumors expressed the
secondary imatinib-resistant kit mutation v654a were treated
with  xxxd3264xxx  in the department of oncology, university
hospital leuven, after progression on imatinib treatment. two
patients showed stable disease during  xxxd3264xxx  treatment for
>11 months and are still on the drug. one gist patient
progressed after one cycle of  xxxd3264xxx , and the treatment was
discontinued (table 1). the treatment with high imatinib dose
(800 mg daily) was restarted but the patient died 6 months later
due to progressive disease.

cancer therapy: preclinical

discussion
although most gist patients show good responses to
imatinib, many of them develop resistance after a long duration
of treatment. acquired resistance to imatinib in gists
commonly occurs via secondary gene mutation in the kit
kinase domain. this finding has implications for strategies to
delay or prevent imatinib resistance and to apply newer
targeted therapies.
the kit-v654a and kit-t670i mutations, located in the
proximal kinase domain of the gene, have been reported as
common, recurrent secondary mutations in gist patients
treated with imatinib, and have been proved to confer
resistance to imatinib (10). in the current study, we have
tested the new  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor  xxxd3264xxx  for the
activity against three primary gists cells with these mutations,
derived from imatinib-resistant patients. all three also harbored a primary mutation in the kit gene, either within exon 9
or exon 11, which were disclosed in baseline pretreatment
biopsies.  xxxd3264xxx  inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of all
these imatinib-refractory mutants at concentrations from 0.5 to
1.0 amol/l. this inhibition was related to cell cycle arrest and
cell growth inhibition after 72 hours of treatment with the
drug. moreover, the in vitro efficiency of  xxxd3264xxx  was equal
for kit(ins503ay)/v654a and kit(ins574pt)/v654a mutants,
indicating that primary kit mutations in extracellular or
juxtamembrane domains [in this case kit(ins503ay) or
kit(ins574pt)] do not affect the efficiency of  xxxd3264xxx  in
inhibiting growth of gists cells refractory to imatinib due to
secondary mutations. the sensitivity to  xxxd3264xxx  on the kitt670i and kit-v654a mutants was further validated in vitro
using transformed ba/f3 murine cells. furthermore,  xxxd3264xxx 
was also shown to be effective in inhibiting kit-activating
mutations of the imatinib-sensitive gist882 cells and control,
imatinib-naı̈ve primary gist cells at concentrations as low as
50 and 10 nmol/l, respectively. interestingly, from 10- to 50fold difference between the positive control imatinib-sensitive
gist and imatinib-resistant mutation-bearing gist cells was
observed, suggesting that the sensitivity to the drug of
imatinib-resistant tumors may also depend on additional
factors that may affect kit kinase inhibition. one of the
possibilities is the development of resistance mechanisms by
the refractory cells that may reduce the active intracellular
concentration of the applied inhibitors. nevertheless, because

 xxxd3264xxx  can be safely administered at dose levels of 50 mg
daily, yielding steady-state plasma levels above 2 amol/l, our
findings suggest that  xxxd3264xxx  can be an efficient second-line
therapy for patients with gists that carry the acquired kitv654a or kit-t670i mutations. this indication was supported
by the clinical observations of three gists patients, whose
tumors carried imatinib-resistant v654a mutation and who
were treated with  xxxd3264xxx  in our hospital. in two of these
patients, the disease has remained stable for the last 11
months, demonstrating the clinical benefit from the treatment.
one patient progressed within 5 weeks of  xxxd3264xxx  treatment.
notably, tumor cells from this particular patient showed
sensitivity to  xxxd3264xxx  in terms of kit receptor autophosphorylation and cell proliferation inhibition by ex vivo assay. the
reason for the discrepancy between ex vivo and in vivo data is
unknown. because the material from the post- xxxd3264xxx 
progressive tumor was not available for the further study, we
were not able to search for possible additional genomic
mutations or alternative functional alteration that could give
tumor cells the selective advantage for growth in spite of
 xxxd3264xxx  treatment. further clinical studies on a larger cohort
of patients are needed to confirm possible benefit from
 xxxd3264xxx  treatment in patients with tumors showing kitt670i and kit-v654a refractory mutants.
to further explore the sensitivity of other imatinib-resistant
mutations to  xxxd3264xxx , we also tested ba/f3 cells expressing the
imatinib-resistant  xxxg1709xxx -d842v mutant. the d842v mutation is the most common activating  xxxg1709xxx  mutation in
gists and was also proven to be imatinib resistant (5, 10). we
observed that, in contrast to tested imatinib-resistant kit
mutants harboring kinase proximal domain acquired mutations,  xxxd3264xxx  did not completely inhibit the  xxxg1709xxx -d842v
mutant at 5 amol/l concentration of the drug, as assessed by
western blot analysis.
in conclusion, our in vitro, ex vivo, and clinical findings
indicate that  xxxd3264xxx  has good inhibitory activity against the
v654a and t670i mutations in kit that confer resistance to
imatinib. in contrast, the  xxxg1709xxx -d842v mutation that
confers resistance to imatinib also confers resistance to
 xxxd3264xxx . our results show that the efficacy of  xxxd3264xxx  for
the treatment of imatinib-resistant gists is dependent on the
type of mutation, emphasizing again the need for customized,
patient-tailored therapy of refractory gists according to
molecular mechanisms of resistance.
