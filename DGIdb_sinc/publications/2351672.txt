in congestive heart failure, cardiac function
is impaired,
and long term survival of patients is poor. new drugs are
needed which improve the pumping of the failing myocardium
(wetzel and hauei, 1988). one approach to this end is to
identify compounds which increase the affinity of  xxxg2307xxx ,
the calcium receptor
component
of troponin.
such compounds, which have been designated
“calcium
sensitizers,”
ought to produce an increase in the force of myocardial
contraction
at a given intracellular
calcium concentration,

 xxxd318xxx  (i) is a drug which affects calcium handling outside
and inside cardiac cells, in that it shows the properties
of a
calcium-channel
blocker and calmodulin
antagonist (vogel et
al., 1979; hoh et al., 1984).  xxxd318xxx  also acts on the contractile
proteins
themselves;
it increases the isometric
contractile
force of skinned cardiac fibers at submaximal calcium concentrations and modifies the calcium dependence of the atpase
activity of cardiac myofibrils
(solar0 et al., 1986). these
effects may be due to an increased affinity of cardiac troponin
c (ctnc)’ for calcium. we have constructed a model of ctnc,
based on the crystal structures of the homologous
proteins
skeletal muscle troponin
c (stnc) and calmodulin
(cam), to
deduce a number of resonance assignments in its ‘h nmr
spectrum (maclachlan
et al., 1990).
this paper reports the use of two other techniques as well
as nmr to investigate the effects of  xxxd318xxx  binding to ctnc.
the drug may be shown by fluorescence kinetic methods to
slow the release of calcium from the regulatory
site of the
protein. circular dichroism
spectroscopy, which is sensitive
to protein secondary structure, has been employed to study
conformational
changes in ctnc induced when  xxxd318xxx  binds.
knowledge
of the three-dimensional
structure of receptors
and drug-receptor
complexes derived by nmr (jardetzky and
roberts, 1981) has been shown to be of tangible assistance to
the drug discovery process (birdsall
et al., 1984). ‘h nmr
experiments
suggest that  xxxd318xxx  binding is localized in the
n-terminal
domain of ctnc and permit a dissociation
constant for the interaction
to be measured; global conformational changes do not occur when the drug binds. this specificity for the n-terminal
domain, and a number of other
changes in the nmr spectrum of the protein, can be qualitatively explained by the model of ctnc (maclachlan
et al.,

fig. 1 shows stopped-flow
traces illustrating
the increase in
fluorescence on mixing solutions of ctnc (fig. la), or ctnc
and  xxxd318xxx ,
(fig. 1b) with excess quin-2. the fluorescence
transients collected over 50 ms are biphasic and may be fitted
to a double exponential
equation. in the absence of  xxxd318xxx 
(fig. la), the fitted curve corresponds to two calcium release
rates of 164 and 0.94 s-l. the faster process contributes
approximately
one-third
of the total signal amplitude
when
corrected for the dead time of the instrument.
the transient
acquired in the presence of  xxxd318xxx  (50 pm final concentration) (fig. 1b) gives two rates of 71 and 4.25 s-‘. data collected
over a longer time period (not shown) gave rates for the slower
process of 1.8 and 2.2 s-l in the absence and presence of
 xxxd318xxx .
these fast and slow rates correspond, respectively,
to calcium release from the single, low affinity, calcium-specific
site
and the pair of high affinity calcium/magnesium-binding
sites
in ctnc (potter and gergely, 1975; crouch and klee, 1980;
drabikowski
et al., 1980). thus, in the presence of  xxxd318xxx ,
the rate of calcium release from the low affinity, n-terminalbinding site is reduced, whereas there is minimal effect at the
high affinity c-terminal
sites.
an alternative
method of monitoring
calcium release is by
the use of fluorescence probes covalently attached to residues
on the protein. the fluorescence of ctnc labeled with iaans
at cys-35 and cys-84 is sensitive to the occupancy of the low
affinity calcium-specific
site (johnson et al., 1980). solar0 et
al. (1986), using this method, have found that  xxxd318xxx  modifies the calcium dependence of the fluorescence of this derivative
of ctnc and thus presumably
its affinity for calcium.
the results shown here have confirmed
this observation

measurements
were
carried
out in a hi-tech
stopped
flow instrument,
with a dead time
of -2.5 ms, at 15 “c!. excitation
was from a xenon lamp (wotan
150
watts/s
or equivalent),
and the incident
beam passed
through
a
monochromator
at 339 nm (5-nm
band pass).
fluorescence
was
monitored
at 90” to the incident
beam, with a 455-nm
cut-off
filter.
the rates of calcium
dissociation
from ctnc were measured
in the
presence
and absence of  xxxd318xxx 
using the fluorescent
calcium
chelator quin-2
(rosenfeld
and taylor,
1985). the increase
in fluorescence on mixing
ctnc
with excess
quin-2
was monitored.

of the rate of calcium

similar results (not presented).
control
experiments
in which calcium
was mixed with quin-2 indicated
that calcium binding
to the chelator
occurred
in the dead time of the instrument.
the amount
of contaminant calcium
in the protein

was estimated
to be less than
10 ham by comparison
of the change

quin2 (240 pm) with buffer and calcium
solutions
(25, 50, and 100 pm), in

itself had no effect on the size of the
fluorescence

cd experiments-ctnc
was dialyzed
at 4 ‘c against ph 7.0 buffer
(10 mm mops,
100 mm kcl, 0.5 mm cac12, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol
in milli q h,o, adjusted
to ph 7.0 with 10 n koh).
the protein
concentration
of the resulting
solution
(1.14 mg/ml)
was determined
from its uv spectrum,
using e::m = 3.1 at 276 nm in the presence
of
calcium
(szynkiewicz
et al., 1985). the solution
was then titrated
with a solution
of racemic

hydrochloride
(2.0 mm, with 0.5
&i/ml
of [“hlbepridil

in milli q h,o containing
kc1 (100

of  xxxd318xxx ,
the cd and
uv spectra
of the ctnc solution
were recorded,
and aliquots
of the
solution
were taken
for liquid scintillation
counting.
cd and uv
spectra were recorded
using, respectively,
a jasco

was carried
out on a beckman

throughout
the titration
the ph of the ctnc
solution
was
maintained
in the range 7.0-7.8.
‘h nmr experiments-samples
of ctnc (typically
5-20 mg) were
dialyzed
at 4 “c against

and again freeze-dried.
finally,
the

‘hz0
(aldrich).
typical
protein
concentrations
were 0.5-2.5

until the ‘h nmr spectrum
resembled
that previously
observed
for the ca*‘-saturated
protein
(hincke

bands at 262 and 268 nm due to the aromatic side chains of
the protein, and an extra band appears at 298 nm. throughout
the titration
a fine suspension formed in the solution, probably due to some precipitation
of  xxxd318xxx  as it was added to
the buffered ctnc solution. however, the scintillation
counting results indicate that any loss of  xxxd318xxx  due to precipitation was minimal. light scattering from the suspension may,
though, have resulted in some loss of intensity
in the cd
spectra, particularly
in the near uv region where a l.o-cm
pathlength
was used.
by comparison with the uv spectrum of  xxxd318xxx  (fig. 2c),
the changes observed in the near uv cd spectra are attributed
to the appearance of a cd spectrum of  xxxd318xxx , arising either
from preferential
binding of one enantiomer
of the compound
to ctnc, or from additional
asymmetry induced in the compound when it complexes with the protein.
the changes in the far uv spectra indicate a small increase
in a-helical content of the protein on binding  xxxd318xxx . klevit
et al. (1985) have shown that the binding of the 27-residue
peptide ml3 from  xxxg1491xxx 
to the homologous calmodulin
results in an increase of about
20% in the a-helical content of the complex in the presence
of calcium; it is expected that this includes contributions
from
both the peptide and the protein.
similar
increases in (yhelical content have been observed for complexes of calmodulin with other peptides (see, for example, maulet and cox,
1983; mcdowell et al., 1985).

fig. 3 shows the effects of titrating

solution of calcium-saturated
ctnc (2.5 mm);
the final  xxxd318xxx  concentration
was 3.75 mm. addition
of
 xxxd318xxx  up to a drug/protein
ratio of 1:l causes well-defined
and specific changes of chemical shift and line width in the
‘h nmr spectrum of the protein. these are clearly evident
in resolution-enhanced
spectra and in comparisons of spectra
obtained at compound to protein ratios intermediate
between
those shown in fig. 3. thereafter,
the changes are much less
pronounced,
being limited to generalized
broadening
of the
protein spectrum.
in the aromatic spectral region, the prominently
downfieldshifted signals rl and r2 move upfield and broaden; signal
rl was previously assigned (maclachlan
et al., 1990) to phe77, and r2 to phe-153. changes are also noted for other
components
of these spin systems, namely r3, r5 (phe-77)
and r7, r5 (phe-153); however, these are partly obscured by
drug signals. the signals r8, r9, previously assigned to phe24 h2,6 and phe-27 h2,6 broaden and shift downfield,
and
rll (phe-74 h2,6) shifts downfield
from 6.59 ppm to -6.8
ppm. in addition,
intensity
due to  xxxd318xxx  appears in the
spectral envelope corresponding
to signals r4 and r5.
some increase in dispersion
of the downfield-shifted
(yproton resonances al-a4
is observed. two of these signals
have been assigned to glu-76 ha and tyr-111 ha, which are
in the limited regions of p-sheet structure which are present
in both domains
of the protein.
these regions of p-sheet
structure, between adjacent calcium-binding
loops, are a common feature of the calcium-binding

kd of -20 elm, with an associated error of about 50%.
titration
of  xxxd318xxx  into calcium-free
ctnc, or dicalciumctnc, produced no significant
chemical shift changes, and
only a slight generalized broadening
(results not shown) indicating that the drug binding is considerably
weaker in these
cases.

construction

of

a model of the  xxxd318xxx -ctnc

(ca”“),

complex

the model of ctnc, based on cam and stnc x-ray structures and nmr data, (maclachlan
et al., 1990) was used to
interpret the results of the  xxxd318xxx -binding
study. the construction of the drug-protein
complex was guided by a consideration of several factors.
(i)-the
results of the stopped-flow
kinetics studies indicate that  xxxd318xxx  appears to have an effect only on the nterminal, low affinity calcium site.
(ii)-the
‘h nmr studies show that  xxxd318xxx  binds most
strongly to calcium-saturated
ctnc, and with far lower affinity to the dicalcium or calcium-free
protein, thus indicating
that high affinity binding of  xxxd318xxx  requires the n-terminal
calcium site to be occupied.
(iii)-most
of the resonances which are strongly perturbed
by  xxxd318xxx  binding have been assigned to specific residues in
the n-terminal
domain of ctnc or have been generally associated with that domain.
(iu)-several
of the most striking changes in the ‘h nmr
spectrum observed when  xxxd318xxx  is added involve the immo-

bilization
of methionine-terminal
methyl groups. the cd
results suggest that there are no major conformational
changes in the protein when the drug binds; thus the observed
immobilization
of these residues is most likely to be as a result
of direct contact of the side chains with the drug itself, with
a consequent
reduction
in side chain mobility.
in a similar
study of drug binding to the homologous protein cam, it was
shown using paramagnetically
labeled analogues, that methionine methyl signals broadened by the interaction
are in fact
at or near the binding site (reid er al., 1990).
(u)-a
number of studies of cam (see for example, prozialeck and weiss, 1982; maulet and cox, 1983) and stnc
(drabikowski
et al., 1985; gariepy and hodges, 1983) support
the notion that hydrophobic
patches on the proteins’ surfaces
exposed by calcium-induced
conformational
changes provide
binding sites for amphipathic
drugs and peptides.
taking these factors into consideration,
the model of ctnc
was examined for possible binding sites for a hydrophobic
drug, such as  xxxd318xxx . gross structural differences are obvious
between the hydrophobic
structures
which are exposed to
solvent in each domain: the hydrophobic
region of the nterminal domain is extensive, and forms a distinct pocket or
cleft, whereas the one in the c-terminal
domain is more
limited in extent, rather more exposed to solvent, and is more
of a “patch” than a “pocket”
in structure. this is clearly
shown in fig. 5a.
because most  xxxd318xxx 
signals are overlapped
by protein
resonances, there is no direct evidence to indicate the conformation of the bound drug. a stereochemically
reasonable
energy minimized
conformation
of the r enantiomer
of the
drug was therefore used.
 xxxd318xxx  was then docked interactively
with the hydrophobic surfaces of the protein with minimal
clash of van der
waals’ surfaces and with such an orientation
that the aromatic rings protruded
into the hydrophobic
cavity. it is obvious that the n-terminal
cleft provides the drug with much
more opportunity
for hydrophobic
bonding than the c-terminal patch. two stereo views of the drug-protein
complex
are shown in fig. 5. in the absence of reliable drug-protein
nuclear overhauser effects, it is only appropriate
to construct
a relatively
low resolution
model of the complex, without
defining close contacts between specific residues and individual drug protons. however, from the docking procedure it is
obvious which protein side chains are likely to participate
in
drug binding.
excision
of a “shell” of -9 a radius about the docked
 xxxd318xxx  reveals more clearly the residues most likely to interact with the drug (fig. 5b). the residues which line the
hydrophobic
cleft include phe-27, phe-77, met-45, met-60,
met-81, met-85, val-64, cys-84, and lys-92. a second sphere
of residues, not in direct contact with the drug but sufficiently
close to be affected, comprises phe-20, phe-24, ile-36, leu41, leu-57, ile-61, met-80, and val-82 inter aliu.
this model is consistent with several features of the nmr
titration.
signals assigned to phe-24, phe-27, and phe-77
broaden and shift; the broadening
is consistent with a reduction in mobility,
and the chemical shift changes may be
influenced
by ring currents from aromatic rings on the drug.
signals due to phe-74 also shift downfield, and although the
model suggests that this residue is not directly involved in the
binding site, it also shows that it is possible that changes in
the orientation
of phe-77 could be transmitted
to phe-24 and
phe-74 inter alia, resulting in the chemical shift perturbations.
four methionine
methyl signals, ml, m4, m5, and m7, are
affected by the complexation
with the drug. of these, only
ml has been assigned to either met-81 or met-157 on the

for calcium, and are hence the basis of  xxxd318xxx ’s
calciumsensitizing properties. unfortunately,
we have not been able
to model these changes in detail as yet. the cd results, in
contrast to nmr, provide direct evidence for an increase in
cy-helicity of the protein. the increase in a-helical
content
observed in cam when several peptides bind has already been
referred to. the propensity
for linear peptides to form (yhelices is increased when they are incorporated
into a hydrophobic environment
such as model lipid membranes or nonaqueous solvents (inagaki et al., 1989). this effect is presumably due to the preference, in the latter environments,
to form
internal hydrogen bonds, rather than to hydrogen bond with
the solvent exterior. thus, it is conceivable that the binding
of a hydrophobic
drug to ctnc, and concomitant
displacement
of bound solvent molecules, might cause a rearrangement
of
the hydrogen bond network in favor of a-helix formation.
comparison with drug binding to homologous proteinsthe interactions
of hydrophobic
and amphiphilic
ligands with
calmodulin
and stnc have been the subjects of numerous
investigations
(reid et al., 1990, and references cited therein).
the results are consistent with the existence of hydrophobic
regions on the proteins, exposed by calcium chelation, which
interact with complementary
regions on the ligands. binding
of these compounds may also be favored by charge interactions between the numerous carboxylate
side chains on the
protein and cationic groups on the ligands. many compounds
also appear to display a propensity
to interact with both nand c-terminal
domains of the protein, either independently,
as in the case of smaller ligands such as  xxxd3431xxx ,
or,
possibly, simultaneously,
as exemplified
by larger peptides

basis of nuclear overhauser effects (maclachlan
et al., 1990).
the  xxxd318xxx -ctnc
model shows that met-45, met-60, met81, and met-85 are part of the hydrophobic
pocket and are in
close proximity to the bound drug. this makes the assignment
of ml to met-81 very likely.
similarly,
the upfield-shifted
methyl groups, t2 and t3,
have been assigned to leu-41 and ile-36. t2 shifts prominently upfield with negligible
further broadening.
ile-36 is
close to and shielded by phe-24 and phe-77, thus it is possible
that the changes in orientation
in phe-77 on binding the drug
are mirrored
by changes in chemical shift of signals tentatively assigned to this residue.
although
the majority of perturbed
resonances are associated with the n-terminal
domain, some c-terminal
signals
also undergo some changes, in particular
those due to phe153. in this domain phe-104, phe-153, phe-156, and met-157
form a distinct hydrophobic
cluster, and it is possible that
some weak  xxxd318xxx  binding occurs here. on the other hand,
it is conceivable that the few changes definitively
ascribable
to the c terminus may be a result of conformational
changes
transmitted
along the a-helical sequence linking this with the
n terminus.
the increase in dispersion
of the signals al to a4, which
are assigned to a-protons in the p-sheet regions of the protein,
is significant.
these residues are part of the calcium binding
regions of the protein, and furthermore
are distant from the
proposed drug-binding
site. thus, chemical shift changes are
most likely due to binding-induced
conformational
changes
rather than contact with the bound drug. these conformational changes probably influence the affinity of the protein

 xxxd318xxx  binding

to ctnc

and the calmodulin antagonist calmidazolium. the salient
features of such small molecule interactions are typified by
recent models of calmidazolium analogue (reid et al., 1990)
and  xxxd3431xxx  (strynadka and james, 1988) complexes
with calmodulin.
our model building predicts the existence of analogous
hydrophobic areas on both domains of ctnc. nmr results
are consistent with an interaction scheme for  xxxd318xxx  similar
to other hydrophobic drug binding to cam and stnc and
involving homologous protein residues. the strong preference
of  xxxd318xxx  toward the n-terminal domain of ctnc may be
explained on the grounds of the very different overall shape
of the hydrophobic sites on each domain, well conveyed by
fig. 5a. the n-terminal  xxxd318xxx -binding site is an extensive
and capacious pocket, in contrast to the c-terminal site which
is much shallower and smaller. this difference between the
two putative sites in ctnc is much more marked than in the
case of cam. we suspect this feature could provide a useful
basis for rational design of novel cardiac-specific calciumsensitizing agents.
