angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels, is an essential part of
reproduction, development, and wound repair.1 under these conditions, angiogenesis is a process controlled according to the physiologic requirements of the
organism.1
many diseases, however, are driven by persistent unregulated angiogenesis as a
pathophysiologic process.1 pathologic angiogenesis plays an important role in the
growth and metastasis of malignant tumors.1 since 1983, several factors responsible
for angiogenesis have been identified. it gradually has become clear that polysaccharides, such as heparin and heparan sulfate, play a key role through their affinity for
certain polypeptide growth factors.1 these heparin-binding growth factors are capable of inducing angiogenesis.1 the family of heparin-binding growth factors, which
had initially been purified by gospodarovic et al.2 consist of structurally related
polypeptides. two members, heparan-binding growth factor 1 ( xxxg786xxx ) and
hbgf2, have been studied under many different names.2 most commonly they are
known as acidic and  xxxg787xxx  (fgf) because of their influence
on the proliferation of mesoderm- and neuroectoderm-derived cells.2 the interactions of the fgfs with heparin have important physiologic implications.2 heparin
increases the biologic activity of acidic fgf and protects acidic and basic fgf from
degradation by heat, acid, and proteases.2 the binding of fgfs to heparan sulfate is
essential for the binding of fgfs to their receptor on the cell surface.2
because fgfs play such an important role in angiogenesis,2 their inactivation
might become an important step towards cancer therapy by blocking angiogensis.
the present study investigates the selective inactivation of fgfs by heparin-like
polysaccharides.

whose anchorage-independent growth depends on the presence of fibroblast growth
factor (fgf), were incubated with 10 ng/ml acidic or basic fgf (fig . 1a and b).
cells were treated with the polyanions dextransulfate, fucoidan,  xxxd2878xxx , and  xxxd3266xxx  at concentrations ranging from 1–400 µg/ml.
in the assays with basic fgf, the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (ic50s)
were 1 µg/ml for  xxxd2878xxx  and fucoidan, 5 µg/ml for dextransulfate, and
100 µg/ml for  xxxd3266xxx  (fig . 1a). in the assays with acidic fgf, the ic50s were 3 µg/
ml for  xxxd2878xxx , and for fucoidan, 10 µg/ml for  xxxd1860xxx  and
100 µg/ml for  xxxd3266xxx  (fig . 1b).
anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cell line mcf7, stimulated by
100 ng/ml insulin-like growth factor 1 ( xxxg1144xxx ), was applied as an experimental model

at concentrations ranging from 1–400 µg/ml. the ic50 for  xxxd3266xxx  was 100 µg/ml;
the heparinoids  xxxd1860xxx , fucoidan, and  xxxd2878xxx  had no effect
(fig . 1c).
competitive binding assays were used to study the effects of polyanions on receptor binding of heparin-binding and nonheparin-binding growth factors (fig . 2).
cells were incubated with labeled growth factors at concentrations similar to the respective kd. nonspecific binding was excluded by adding excess amounts of
nonradioactive ligand. the polyanionic compounds dextransulfate, fucoidan,  xxxd2878xxx , and  xxxd3266xxx  were added at concentrations ranging from 1–
1,000 µg/ml.
the ic50s for the binding of basic fgf to its receptor were 1 µg/ml for pentosan
polysulfate, 5 µg/ml for fucoidan, 1 µg/ml for  xxxd1860xxx , and 100 µg/ml for
 xxxd3266xxx  (fig . 2a). the ic50s for binding of acidic fgf to its receptor were 3 µg/ml
for  xxxd2878xxx  and for fucoidan, 50 µg/ml for dextransulfate, and 100 µg/
ml for  xxxd3266xxx  (fig . 2b).
the polysulfated heparinoids had no effect on binding of  xxxg1144xxx  to its receptor. the
ic50 for binding of  xxxg1144xxx  to its receptor was 100 µg/ml for  xxxd3266xxx  (fig . 2c).

discussion
we have shown that polysulfated heparinoids selectively inactivate heparin-binding angiogenesis factors basic fgf and acidic fgf. the effects of heparinoids are
more potent on basic fgf than on acidic fgf. basic fgf exhibits a higher affinity
for heparin (1.5 mnacl) than does acidic fgf (1.0 mnacl). in addition, we demonstrated that heparinoids can also inactive heparin-binding growth factors, which
do not belong to the fgf family, such as heregulin or pleiotrophin (data not shown).
heparinoids exert no effect on nonheparin-binding growth factors, as demonstrated
for  xxxg1144xxx  (fig . 1c and 2c), egf, and tgfalpha (not shown).  xxxd3266xxx  inactives heparinbinding and nonheparin-binding growth factors. the concentrations of  xxxd3266xxx  necessary for inactivation of heparin-binding growth factors are 100 times higher than
the necessary concentrations of heparinoids.  xxxd3266xxx , a polyanion, has been shown
to inhibit cancer growth in various clinical trials. however, nonselective binding to
proteins induces toxic side effects.4

the angiogenetic capacities of basic and acidic fgf have been demonstrated in
several publications.1–3 high expression of fgf has been associated with progressive growth of fibrosarcomas,3 astrocytomas,5 glioblastomas,6 pancreatic carcinomas,7 renal carcinomas,8 colon carcinoma,9 and head and neck tumors.10 elevated
levels of basic fgf have been detected in the urine of patients with a wide spectrum
of cancers.11
our data indicate that the affinity of fgfs for heparin can be used for selective
inactivation of these and other growth factors that bind to heparin. the mechanism
of inactivation of heparin-binding growth factors by heparinoids has not yet been
clarified. studies of the fucoidan-binding properties with various proteins have demonstrated that the number and disposition of sulfate groups are important for the interaction of the heparinoid with basic amino acids such as arginine, lysine, or
histidine.12,13 our experiments (data not shown) have demonstrated that the binding
sites of heparin and the heparinoid  xxxd2878xxx  on fgf are not identical.
similar results have been obtained from binding studies of heparin and pentosan
polysulfate to antithrombin.14
we therefore may speculate that polysulfated heparinoids inactivate the fgfs by
preventing their binding to heparin in a noncompetitive way, and through this mechanism prevent the binding of fgf to its receptor. it has been shown that fgf binding
to the receptor is dependent on heparin.15
in conclusion, our data show that polysulfated heparinoids exert a selective inhibitory effect on heparin-binding angiogenesis factors. in contrast,  xxxd3266xxx  inhibits
growth factors in a nonselective way. however, the concentrations of  xxxd3266xxx , necessary to block heparin-binding growth factors, are 100 times higher than the concentrations of polysulfated heparinoids. various studies have demonstrated that
polysulfated heparinoids can inhibit tumor growth in vivo.16–19
the present study might provide some insight into the mechanism of action
through which polysulfated heparinoids exert their growth inhibitory effects on tumor cells. the application of polysulfated heparinoids might block metastatic tumour growth by inhibiting angiogenesis factors.

summary
angiogenesis is a prerequisite for tumor expansion and metastasis. the angiogenic potential of the heparin-binding growth factors  xxxg786xxx 
(fgf) and basic fgf has been demonstrated in various publications. we studied the
inhibitory effects of  xxxd3266xxx  and the polysulfated heparinoids  xxxd2878xxx ,
 xxxd1860xxx , and fucoidan on the action of fgf. as an experimental model, we
used the adrenal cancer cell line sw 13, whose anchorage-independent growth depends on the presence of fgf. the polysulfated heparinoids inhibited fgf-induced
growth and binding to the receptor at an ic50 of 0.5–3 µg/ml.  xxxd3266xxx  inhibited fgf
at an ic50 of 100 µg/ml. the polysulfated heparinoids exerted no effect on igf-1 or
tgfalpha−related growth.  xxxd3266xxx  inhibited the anchorage-independent growth induced by igf-1 or tgfalpha only at an ic50 of 100 µg/ml. our results indicate that
 xxxd3266xxx  inhibits growth factors in a nonselective way. by contrast, polysulfated heparinoids exert a selective inhibitory effect on heparin binding angiogenesis factors

at an ic50, which is 100 times below the ic50 of  xxxd3266xxx . therefore, the administration of polysulfated heparinoids might become a novel approach to tumor therapy
based on blocking angiogenesis.
