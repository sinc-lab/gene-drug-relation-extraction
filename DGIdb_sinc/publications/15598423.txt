abstract
immunomodulatory drugs (imids) are potent inhibitors of tnf- and il-1 and elevators of il-10 production in lps-stimulated human pbmc. they are currently in clinical trials for various diseases, including multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome,
and melanoma. in the present study, we have investigated the evects of thalidomide,  xxxd2452xxx  and  xxxd2984xxx  on the expression of
cox-2 by stimulated pbmc. our results show that thalidomide and imids inhibited the expression of cox-2 but not the cox-1
protein in lps-tnf- and il-1 stimulated pbmc and shortened the half-life of cox-2 mrna in a dose-dependent manner. they
also inhibited the synthesis of  xxxd1903xxx  from lps-stimulated pbmc. while anti-tnf- or il-1 neutralizing antibodies
had no evect on cox-2 expression, anti-il-10 neutralizing antibody elevated the expression of cox-2 mrna, and protein from
treated pbmc. these data suggest that the anti-inxammatory and anti-tumor evects of imids may be due in part to elevation of  xxxg1161xxx  production and its subsequent inhibition of cox-2 expression.

1. introduction
thalidomide has been shown to exhibit anti-angiogenic, anti-inxammatory properties via a yet unknown
molecular mechanism. it has a wide spectrum of pharmacological activities against clinical conditions such as
crohn’s disease, graft versus host disease, behcet’s disease, erythema nodosum leprosum, and several hematopoietic and solid tumors [1–10].
to obtain more potent immunomodulatory drugs
than thalidomide, without the teratogenic side evects,
several structural analogs of thalidomide have been

synthesized and tested on lps1-stimulated pbmc for
their inhibition of tnf- production. new analogs of
thalidomide, the immunomodulatory drugs (imids)
are shown to be at least 50,000-fold more potent than
thalidomide in inhibiting tnf- production by lpsstimulated monocytes. this class of analogs is also
shown to inhibit il-1 and il-6 and enhance il-10
production in a dose-dependent manner by lps-stimulated human pbmc [11–14]. furthermore, imids have
also been shown to inhibit angiogenesis in several in
vitro and in vivo experiments. given all of these

properties, imids are currently undergoing evaluation
in the treatment of various hematopoietic and solid
tumors [15–18].
cyclooxygenase (cox) is an enzyme that catalyses
the transformation of  xxxd208xxx  into prostaglandin. three isoforms of the cox enzyme have been
identiwed: cox-1, which is constitutively expressed;
cox-2; which is induced in several cell types by proinxammatory stimuli such as lps, tnf- and il-1;
and cox-3, the function of which has been less well
characterized, but which has been shown to be the target of acetaminophen [19–22]. the induction of cox2 expression by tnf- and il-1 in cancer cells was
shown to be through the activation of the nf-b
pathway [23]. several reports have shown that the
anti-inxammatory cytokine il-10 is a potent inhibitor
of macrophage function, blocking synthesis of il-1,
tnf-, il-6, il-8, and cox-2 [24–26]. these studies
suggested that il-10 plays a role in the regulation of
cox-2 expression from activated monocytes. numerous studies have demonstrated that cox-2 but not
cox-1 overexpression plays a major role in the pathogenesis of diverent types of cancers, such as head and
neck, breast, lung, colon, and pancreas [27–30]. overexpression of cox-2 has been demonstrated in diverent animal models of inxammation and tumors
[31,32].
recent studies also demonstrated that overexpression of cox-2 played a role in the tumor angiogenesis process [33,34]. saha et al. [35] have shown that the
anti-angiogenic small molecule  xxxd3191xxx  was able to
inhibit the endogenous as well as the phorbol esterinduced expression of cox-2 in human lung carcinoma cells. this suggests that the ability of a small
molecule to inhibit angiogenesis might be related to
its inhibitory activities on the expression of the cox2 protein. other studies have shown that non-steroidal
anti-inxammatory drugs (nsaids) such as celecoxib
inhibit the growth of a tumor size and proliferation of
tumor cells by a cox-2-dependent mechanism [36].
in the current study, we have examined the inxuence
of imids on the expression of cox-2 from stimulated monocytes. our results indicate that imids
inhibited the expression of the cox-2 protein and
mrna from lps-stimulated pbmc in a dose-dependent manner. the evects of thalidomide and imids
were also investigated on the expression of cox-2 by
human pbmc stimulated with proinxammatory cytokines such as tnf- and il-. neutralizing antibody
against il-10 but not tnf- or il-1 elevated cox2 expression in  xxxd2452xxx  treated samples indicating
that  xxxd2452xxx -mediated il-10 upregulation plays a
role in cox-2 expression. our results provide new
information for understanding the anti-inxammatory and anti-angiogenic activities of thalidomide and
the imids.

2. materials and methods
2.1. antibodies and reagents
imids and thalidomide (celgene corporation, warren, nj) were dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso)
to prepare stock solutions. the wnal concentration of
dmso was kept at 0.1% for all the assays. all the antibodies for the western blot were purchased from santa
cruz biotechnology (santa cruz, ca).
2.2. cells
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) were
isolated from leukocyte units buvy coat, (blood center
of new jersey) from healthy donors by  xxxd3253xxx –hypaque
gradient centrifugation. the serological status of donors
was performed by elisa assay at the blood center of
new jersey.
2.3. western blotting
pbmc were plated at 2.5 £ 106 cells per ml media (as
described in section 2.2) overnight. for cox-1 and
cox-2 expression: pbmc were pretreated with either
thalidomide or imids for 1 h and stimulated with either
lps (10 ng/ml) or tnf- (10 ng/ml) or il-1 (15 ng/ml).
at diverent time points, the cells were then lysed in a
ripa buver and generated cell lysate. approximately,
50 l of this mixture was loaded per lane on 10% tris–
glycine polyacrylamide gels (novex), electrophoresed,
and transferred to pvdf membranes (novex). pvdf
membranes were blocked for 1 h and incubated overnight at 4 °c with cox-1, cox-2, il-1, tnf-, il-10
or -actin polyclonal antibodies (santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz ca). membranes were then developed using the ecl plus chemiluminescent detection
system (amersham–pharmacia biotech).
2.4. northern blotting
the total rna was prepared using the trizol
reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol (invitrogen). total cellular rna (20 g) was electrophoresed
through 1% agarose–formaldehyde denaturing gels and
transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane
(ambion brightstar-plus). the wlters were hybridized
with radiolabeled cox-1, cox-2 or  xxxg861xxx . dna
probes were labeled with 32p by the random primer
method. for mrna stability, pbmc (1.5 £ 107 cells per
treatment) were pretreated with either 0.1% dmso or
diverent concentrations of imids for 1 h. the treated
cells were then stimulated with lps (10 ng/ml). after
selected time points,  xxxd1800xxx  d was added to each
sample at a wnal concentration of 10 g/ml. the total
rna was extracted at various time points and cox

mrnas were evaluated by using northern blot analysis
as described above. autoradiographic signals were
quantiwed on a storm phosphor imager (molecular
dynamics), and then normalized to  xxxg861xxx  signals.
northern blots were performed using 20 g of total cellular rna electrophoresed through 1% agarose–formaldehyde denaturing gels and transferred to a positively
charged nylon membrane (ambion brightstar-plus). the
wlters were hybridized with radiolabeled cox-2 or
 xxxg861xxx  probes using t4 polynucleotide kinase.
for cox-2 rna stability, 3 £ 107 cells per treatment
were used in a wnal volume of 10 ml. the cells were
treated with either dmso (0.1%) or  xxxd2452xxx  (1 m) for
1 h followed by the addition of lps at a wnal concentration of 10 ng/ml. two hours after the addition of lps,
 xxxd1800xxx  d was added at a wnal concentration of
5 g/ml. the treatments were harvested at either time
zero, 1 or 2 h after  xxxd1800xxx  d.
autoradiographic signals were quantiwed on a storm
phosphor imager (molecular dynamics) and then normalized to  xxxg861xxx  signals.
2.5. cox-2 activity and pge2 elisa assays
the cox-2 activity assay was performed according to
the procedure from cayman chemical company (ann
arbor, mi). in this assay, puriwed ovine cox-1 and
cox-2 enzymes were used and activity was determined
using a colorimetric enzyme assay. pge2 in medium was
measured using an elisa assay from cayman chemical
company. a total of 1 £ 106 cells were plated in triplicate
in serum-free media. the cells were then pretreated for
1 h with diverent concentrations of the compound and
stimulated with pma (1 ng/ml) for additional 3 h.  xxxd208xxx  (20 m) was added to stimulated cells and
incubated for additional 3 h. supernatants were used in
the elisa assay to determine the amount of pge2 following the manufacturer’s procedure.

pretreated with imids for 1 h and stimulated with lps (10 ng/ml),
tnf- (10 ng/ml) or il-1 (15 ng/ml) for 24 h and harvested the cell
lysates for western blot analysis. antibodies speciwc for human cox2 and -actin were used to detect protein expression. (c) antibody

expressed and there was no inhibitory evect after the addition of  xxxd2452xxx  even  xxxd1891xxx  m when compared with lps
treated cells (fig. 1c). the results from these experiments
indicated that the inhibitory evects of imids are speciwc
for cox-2 from a stimulated monocyte population.

mrna from lps-stimulated pbmc

3. results
3.1. imids inhibit the expression of cox-2 protein from
lps, il-1 and tnf- stimulated pbmc
to assess whether imids regulate cox-2, we examined
the expression of cox-2 from stimulated pbmc by western blot analysis. pbmc were pretreated with various concentrations of either  xxxd2452xxx  or  xxxd2984xxx  for 1 h, then
stimulated with lps, tnf- or il- for 24 h. as shown in
figs. 1a and b, unstimulated cells do not express the
cox-2 protein. upon stimulation with lps, tnf- or  xxxg1169xxx  there is a signiwcant increase in expression of cox-2
compared with unstimulated cells. the addition of  xxxd2452xxx  or  xxxd2984xxx  inhibited this expression in a dose-dependent manner. cox-1, on the other hand, was constitutively

to investigate the evects of imids on the expression
of cox-2 mrna, pbmc were pretreated with drugs
for 1 h and then stimulated with lps for various lengths
of time (2, 4, 8, and 20 h). as shown in fig. 2a, stimulation with lps induced the expression of cox-2 mrna
compared with dmso treatment. the addition of  xxxd2452xxx  inhibited the expression of cox-2 mrna at the
later time points (8 and 20 h). at 20 h, the amount of
cox-2 mrna was also inhibited in lps treated cells.
our explanation for this is that longer exposure of cells
to lps caused enhancement in the secretion of il-10
protein which resulted in inhibition of cox-2 mrna in
both lps and lps plus drug treated cells.
the evects of thalidomide,  xxxd2452xxx  and  xxxd2984xxx 
were also tested on the expression of cox-2 mrna at 1

fig. 2. evects of thalidomide and imids on expression of cox-2 mrna by pbmc stimulated with lps. pbmc from healthy donors were pretreated 1 h with either thalidomide or imids and then stimulated with lps (10 ng/ml). total rna was harvested at diverent time points as indicated
in each graph and 20 g of each sample was subjected to northern blot analysis as described in section 2. (a) evects of  xxxd2452xxx  on expression of
cox-2 at various time points. (b) dose–response evects of thalidomide,  xxxd2452xxx  and  xxxd2984xxx  on expression of cox-2 mrna. (c) evects of  xxxd2452xxx  on stability cox-2 mrna using  xxxd1800xxx  d. pbmc were cultured in the presence of  xxxd2452xxx  at 1 m for 1 h. treated cells were then stimulated with lps (10 ng/ml) for 3 h before addition of  xxxd1800xxx  d at wnal concentration of 10 g/ml to stop rna synthesis. at various time points
after  xxxd1800xxx  d (0, 1, 2, and 3 h), total rna was extracted and subjected to northern blot analysis as described under section 2.

and 10 m. as shown in fig. 2b, all three agents inhibited
the expression of cox-2 mrna in a dose-dependent
manner. thalidomide was shown to be less potent than
imids in this experiment and other in vitro experiments
(data not shown). to understand the mechanism by
which  xxxd2452xxx  inhibits cox-2 protein expression, we
investigated the evects of the  xxxd2452xxx  on the steady state
levels of cox-2 mrna from lps stimulated pbmc in
the presence or absence of  xxxd1800xxx  d, an rna synthesis inhibitor. in this experiment, cells were pretreated
with  xxxd2452xxx  at 1 m for 1 h and then stimulated with
lps for 4 h. after stimulation,  xxxd1800xxx  d was added
and the total rna was harvested at indicated time points

and subjected to northern blot analysis. as it shown in
fig. 2c, stimulation with lps increased the cox-2
mrna compared with the control treatment, and the
addition of  xxxd2452xxx  inhibited the expression. furthermore, treatment with  xxxd2452xxx  enhanced the degradation
rate of cox-2 mrna in a time-dependent manner.
3.3. evects of imids on enzymatic activity of cox-1 and
cox-2
the evects of imids were also investigated on the
activity of both cox-1 and cox-2. for this, the evects
of  xxxd2452xxx  and  xxxd2984xxx  were tested on puriwed ovine

used and activity was determined using a colorimetric enzyme assay.

cox-1 and cox-2 enzymes using colorimetric enzyme
assays. as shown in figs. 3a and b, the drugs did not
have any evect on the activity of either cox-1 or cox2. aspirin was used as a positive control and was shown
to inhibit the activity of both cox-1 and cox-2 in a
concentration dependent manner.  xxxd2065xxx  and ns398
were also used as positive controls and were shown to
inhibit cox-2 but not cox-1 activity. these results
indicated that imids inhibit the expression but not
activity of the cox-2 protein.
3.4.  xxxd2452xxx  increases the expression of il-10 mrna
and protein from lps-stimulated pbmc
previous reports have shown that imids were able to
inhibit il-1 and tnf- production by lps-stimulated
pbmc in a dose-dependent manner [11]. in this study,
we investigated the evects of  xxxd2452xxx  on the expression
of il-10 mrna. as shown in fig. 4, lps stimulation
enhanced the expression of il-10 mrna in a timedependent manner, which peaked at 8 h. the addition of
 xxxd2452xxx  at 1 m enhanced il-10 mrna expression
over lps-stimulated cells in a time-dependent manner.
to investigate the evects of  xxxd2452xxx  on expression of
il-10 protein, the pbmc were pretreated with either

total rna was harvested at various time points as indicated in graph

described in section 2. (a) evects of  xxxd2452xxx  on expression of il-10

the supernatants were analyzed for il-10 production by elisa. data
shown are representative of three similar experiments.

 xxxd2452xxx  or  xxxd2984xxx  at 1 m, and treated cells were
then stimulated with lps (10 ng/ml) for 48 h. the supernatants were analyzed for il-10 production by elisa
assay. as shown in fig. 4b, both agents increased the
production of il-10 in a dose-dependent manner. similar experiments were done on puriwed t cells and monocytes. our results indicated that monocyte but not t cells
were the source of il-10 production when cells were pretreated with drug and stimulated with lps (data not
shown).
3.5. neutralizing antibody to il-10 but not il-1 or
tnf- partially reverses the inhibitory evects of imids
on cox-2 expression
the anti-inxammatory cytokine il-10 has been
shown to regulate the expression of cox-2 [24]. since
imids enhanced the secretion of il-10, we investigated
the potential role that il-10 might play in the inhibition
of cox-2 by imids. to do this, cells were pre-treated
with  xxxd2452xxx  and then stimulated with lps in the
absence or presence of a neutralizing antibody to il-10,

fig. 5. anti-il-10 antibody increase expression of cox-2 protein and mrna. (a,b) pbmc were pretreated with  xxxd2452xxx  for 1 h and stimulated
with lps (10 ng/ml) for 24 h. cell lysates were harvested for western blot analysis. antibodies to cox-2, tnf-, il-1, il-10, -actin or isotype
control were used. (c) pbmc were pretreated 1 h with  xxxd2452xxx  at 1 m and stimulated with lps (10 ng/ml). total rna was harvested after 4 h and
20 g of each sample was subjected to northern blot analysis as described in section 2.

tnf- or il-1. as shown in fig. 5a, lps stimulation
enhanced the expression of cox-2 compared with
unstimulated cells. the addition of  xxxd2452xxx  signiwcantly
inhibited the expression of cox-2 compared with lpsstimulated cells. the addition of a neutralizing antibody
to il-10 but not isotype control increased the cox-2
expression in lps- and lps +  xxxd2452xxx -treated cells,
thus conwrming the inhibitory role of il-10 in cox-2
expression. in a northern blot analysis using a neutralizing antibody to il-10, we also obtained similar results
(fig. 5c). anti-il-10 antibody increased cox-2 mrna
levels in  xxxd2452xxx  treated samples. therefore, cc-5013induced il-10 production plays a role in cox-2 expression, but we cannot rule out an il-10-independent
mechanism of  xxxd2452xxx -mediated cox-2 inhibition.
the role of pro-inxammatory cytokines tnf- and
il-1 in  xxxd2452xxx -mediated cox-2 inhibition was also
investigated our results indicated that neutralizing antibodies to either tnf- or il-1 had no signiwcant evect
on cox-2 protein levels compared to the isotype control
antibody (fig. 5b).
3.6. imids inhibit the synthesis of pge2 from lpsstimulated pbmc in a dose-dependent manner
to assess whether the increased cox-2 synthesis was
associated with an increase in the formation of pge2,
we investigated the release of pge2 in response to lps
in the presence of  xxxd208xxx . as shown in fig. 6,
lps increased the synthesis of pge2 about sixfold over
unstimulated cells in the presence of exogenous  xxxd208xxx . the addition of  xxxd2452xxx  or  xxxd2984xxx  inhibited the secretion of pge2 in a dose-dependent manner.

fig. 6.  xxxd2452xxx  inhibits the synthesis of pge2 by pbmc from healthy
donors were pretreated with  xxxd2452xxx  and  xxxd2984xxx  at either 1 or
10 m for 1 h and stimulated with lps (10 ng/ml) in the presence of
20 m  xxxd208xxx  for a total of 3 h. the supernatants were tested
for the presence of pge2 by elisa.

4. discussion
cox-2 is secreted by several cell populations such as
wbroblasts, endothelial cells, and monocytes/macrophages in response to diverent stimuli [37,38]. macrophages are known to play a major role in the innate
immune defense system against pathogens and tumor
cells and represent one of the main cellular sources of
cox-2 expression upon exposure to diverent stimuli
[19]. reports by diverent laboratories have shown that
these cells are abundant in the stroma of several tumors
and are potentially signiwcant sources of pro-inxammatory cytokines and pro-angiogenic factors. a recent

f. payvandi et al. / cellular immunology 230 (2004) 81–88

study by bowman and bost [39] has shown that macrophage and dendritic cells are rich sources of the cox-2
protein in mesenteric lymph nodes of mice following
infection with salmonella. use of the cox-2-speciwc
inhibitor celecoxib to treat mice with salamonellosis
resulted in prolonging the survival of lethally infected
animals.
in the present study, we report that lps and proinxammatory cytokines such as il-1 and tnf-
induce expression of the cox-2 protein and mrna
from human monocytes as assessed by either western or
northern blot analysis. the addition of either  xxxd2452xxx 
or  xxxd2984xxx  inhibited the expression of cox-2 in a dosedependent manner (fig. 1a). however, the addition of
these compounds at similar concentrations had no evect
on the expression of the cox-1 protein, which suggests
the speciwcity of the inhibitory activity of imids on
cox-2. in resting unstimulated pbmc, only cox-1 but
not cox-2 was detected. using the lps-stimulated
mouse cell line raw 264.7, fujita et al. have shown that
thalidomide inhibited the expression of cox-2 from
these cells.
several studies have indicated that overexpression of
cox-2 occurred in a variety of human malignancies,
including colon, breast, lung, liver, skin, bladder, uterus,
prostate, and ovarian cancers [40–42]. furthermore, the
cox-2 expression has been shown to promote angiogenesis, tumor invasion and metastasis [33,34]. mao et al.
isolated alveolar macrophages from heavily active smokers who were treated with the cox-2 selective inhibitor
celecoxib and compared them with non-smokers for
their cox-2 expressions. their results indicated that
treatment with a cox-2 inhibitor signiwcantly reduced
pge2 (a product of cox-2) production from alveolar
macrophages recovered from patients. this suggests that
cox-2 inhibitors are able to modulate the microenvironment within the lungs and block the growth and
metastasis of tumors. using cox-2 inhibitors, numerous reports have shown that a decrease in cox-2 activity resulted in a decrease in tumor growth in several
tumors [43,44]. chen et al. [36] have shown that tumor
invasiveness and liver metastasis of colon cancer cells
correlated with cox-2 expression and were inhibited by
a cox-2-selective inhibitor,  xxxd2065xxx . combination use
of cox-2 inhibitor, celecoxib with chemotherapeutic
agents such as  xxxd2383xxx  and 5-xuorouracil have been
shown to improve the cancer patient’s quality of life [45].
recently, published results showed that a combination
of  xxxd2383xxx  with cox-2 inhibitors such as celecoxib or
thalidomide enhanced the anti-tumor eycacy and
reduced side evects of  xxxd2383xxx  [46]. combination therapy of thalidomide and  xxxd2383xxx  in nine colorectal
patients indicated that thalidomide was able to reduce
the dose-limiting gastrointestinal toxic evects of  xxxd2383xxx ,
especially diarrhea and nausea. this demonstrates the
benewt and potential use of a combination of cox-2

87

inhibitors with other chemotherapeutic agents for cancer
therapy.
our data show that the decrease in cox-2 protein in
response to imids correlated well with a decrease in the
expression cox-2 mrna, as measured by northern
blot analysis (fig. 2b). this decrease in response to
imids was detected after 4 h of drug treatment, suggesting that the drug is not avecting transcription of the
cox-2 gene in stimulated monocytes. for this reason,
we investigated the role of other proteins that might
have been involved in the inhibitory process of  xxxd2452xxx 
on the expression of cox-2.
regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes occurs at
multiple levels [47]. our data indicate that  xxxd2452xxx 
caused cox-2 mrna degradation (fig. 2c), which
were consistent with the results for fugita et al. [48].
in general, the imids have an inhibitory evect on
cytokines secreted by stimulated monocytes, but it has a
stimulatory evect on cytokine production by stimulated
t cells. the mechanism by which imids inhibit the
secretion of monocyte products such as tnf- has been
shown to be related to mrna destabilization [13]. however, the evect of imids on t cell cytokine production
has been shown to be at the level of transcription, via
increased activity of the  xxxg1222xxx  [49].
in this regard, the evects of imids on monocytes appear
to be distinct from their evects on t cells. anti-inxammatory cytokines such as il-10 and il-4 have been
shown to down-regulate the expression of cox-2 from
lps-stimulated monocytes [50]. also, berg et al. [24]
demonstrated the signiwcant role of il-10 in the regulation of cox-2 using il-10-dewcient mice. our results
indicate that  xxxd2452xxx  enhanced the production of il-10
in a dose-dependent manner compared with the dmso
control (fig. 4b). using northern blot analysis, we also
showed that il-10 mrna was detectable as early as 2 h
and peaked at 8 h after stimulation (fig. 4a). the addition of the anti-il-10 antibody to treated pbmc
increased the expression of cox-2 mrna and protein
(figs. 5a and c). this demonstrates that  xxxd2452xxx -mediated il-10 production contributes to its inhibition of
cox-2 expression.
a growing body of experimental evidence suggests
that cox-2 plays an important role in the development
of inxammation and the number of cancers. furthermore, inhibition of cox-2 has been shown to reduce the
growth of cancer cells in an in vitro and in vivo experimental setup. in conclusion, we have shown that thalidomide and imids inhibit the expression of the cox-2
protein and mrna from stimulated human pbmc.
this opens the possibility that one of the mechanisms by
which imids have shown success in the treatment of
oncological and inxammatory diseases is by inhibition
of the cox-2 expression. furthermore, we have shown
that enhancement of il-10 production by imids plays a
partial role in this cox-2 inhibitory process.
