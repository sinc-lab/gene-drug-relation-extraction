pharmacological characterization of unique  xxxd3000xxx -binding sites in human kidney.  in human kidney, we found unique  xxxd3000xxx -binding sites that were insensitive to  xxxd2914xxx  and were thus unlikely to be alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. as the binding of [(3)h] xxxd3000xxx  to  xxxd2914xxx -insensitive sites was prevented by 100 microm  xxxd2241xxx , the insensitive sites were evaluated by subtracting [(3)h] xxxd3000xxx  binding in the presence of 100 microm  xxxd2241xxx  from that in the presence of 10 microm  xxxd2914xxx . [(3)h] xxxd3000xxx  bound to the  xxxd2914xxx -insensitive sites monophasically with a high affinity (pk(d); 9.1+/-0.08, n=8), and the b(max) value (814+/-204 fmol mg(-1) protein, n=8) was more than ten times that of the  xxxd2914xxx -sensitive alpha(1)-adrenoceptor (pk(d)=9.9+/-0.13, b(max)=66+/-23 fmol mg(-1) protein, n=7). the  xxxd2914xxx -insensitive sites in human kidney were highly sensitive to other quinazoline derivatives such as terazosin and doxazosin. however, other alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists (tamsulosin, wb4101 and corynanthine) did not inhibit the binding at a range of concentrations that generally exhibit alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonism, and noradrenaline, rauwolscine and propranolol were without effect on the [(3)h] xxxd3000xxx  binding. on the other hand, ligands for the renal na(+)-transporter (amiloride and triamterene) and for imidazoline recognition sites ( xxxd2241xxx , guanfacine and  xxxd94xxx ) displaced the binding of [(3)h] xxxd3000xxx  to  xxxd2914xxx -insensitive sites at micromolar concentrations. photoaffinity labeling with [(125)i]iodoarylazidoprazosin showed  xxxd2914xxx -insensitive labeling at around 100 kda, a molecular size larger than that of human alpha(1a)- and alpha(1b)-adrenoceptors expressed in 293 cells (50-60 and 70-80 kda, respectively) on electrophoresis. in contrast, there was no detectable  xxxd2914xxx -insensitive binding site but were  xxxd2914xxx -sensitive alpha(1)-adrenoceptors in human liver (pk(d)=10.0+/-0.06, b(max)=44+/-6 fmol mg(-1) protein, n=3).  xxxd2914xxx -insensitive  xxxd3000xxx  binding sites were also detected in rabbit kidney (approximately 50% of specific binding sites) but were minor in rat kidney (less than 20%). in conclusion, there are unique  xxxd3000xxx -binding sites in human kidney, the pharmacological profiles of which were distinct from those of known adrenoceptors.
