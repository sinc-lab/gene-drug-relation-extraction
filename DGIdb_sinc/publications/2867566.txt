seh,ctivity of two i-n-trifluoroethyl benzodiazepines jor the  xxxd1459xxx -i receptors in the rat brain. pharmacol biochem
behav 23(6) 973-978, 1985.--receptor autoradiographic techniques have been used to demonstrate the selectivity of two
trifluoroethyl-containing benzodiazepines for one of the subtypes of benzodiazepine receptor. indirect localization of the
binding sites for  xxxd3058xxx  and  xxxd2255xxx  was accomplished by using the ability of these compounds to displace [:~h]flunitrazepam binding. the appropriate binding parameters were selected on the basis of initial studies aimed at identifying
the binding characteristics of several benzodiazepine compounds in comparison with the  xxxd811xxx  cl218,872.
autoradiographic analysis of the benzodiazepine sites displaceable with  xxxd3058xxx  and  xxxd2255xxx  revealed the two benzodiazepine compounds preferentially labeled receptor sites in regions of the brain dominated by the type 1 benzodiazepine
receptor subtype. thus,  xxxd3058xxx  and  xxxd2255xxx  preferentially bind to benzodiazepine type-1 receptors in lamina iv of
the cerebral cortex, the zona incerta, substantia nigra and the cerebellum.

 xxxd3058xxx 
the new sedative-hypnotic  xxxd3058xxx , have indicated that
this compound is capable of producing sedation with less
ataxia and tolerance than other benzodiazepines [1,14].
homogenate preparations of brain membranes have indicated that several of these trifluoroethyl substituted benzodiazepines show an apparent selectivity for the benzodiazepine receptors in the cerebellum, a tissue thought to
contain only the  xxxd1459xxx -i receptor subtype [2, 4, 16]. in the
present study, we sought to use autoradiographic techniques
[15, 26, for review see 7 or 21] to demonstrate that two of the
1-n-trifluoroethyl
benzodiazepines,
 xxxd3058xxx 
and
 xxxd2255xxx , show selectivity for the  xxxd1459xxx - 1 receptor subtype
found in several discrete microscopic regions of the brain.

b i n d i n g studies, performed in homogenate membrane
preparations, have indicated the existence of two distinct
receptors for the class of anxiolytic, sedative-hypnotic,
muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant drugs known as the benzodiazepines [6, 12, 17, 19, 23]. the characterization of these
two benzodiazepine receptor subtypes (termed  xxxd1459xxx -i and
 xxxd1459xxx -2 or type- 1 and type-2) was based on the binding of a
representative of a non-benzodiazepine class of compounds
known as triazolopyridazines [6, 8, for review see 18]. the
most frequently used drug of this class is cl218,872, a compound selective for the  xxxd1459xxx -1 receptor subtype. later
studies have also demonstrated that a group of benzodiazepine receptor antagonists, the beta-carbolines, show
selectivity for the  xxxd1459xxx -1 receptor subtype as well [12]. the
identification of these benzodiazepine receptor subtypes has
raised the possibility that more selective sedative-hypnotic
or anxiolytic compounds could be generated which do not
produce the undesired ataxic side effects seen with the more
classic benzodiazepines.
the study of the individual roles  xxxd1459xxx -1 receptor vs.
 xxxd1459xxx -2 receptor stimulation plays in producing the actions of
 xxxd1459xxx  compounds has been hampered by the lack of benzodiazepines themselves, which demonstrate selectivity for
these receptor subtypes and has even called into question
their actual existence [10]. recent studies, performed with

method
initial biochemical studies were performed to examine the
binding characteristics of several benzodiazepine compounds by their ability to displace [:~h]-flunitrazepam ([:~h]flu) binding on tissue slice preparations. male spraguedawley rats (200-250 g) were sacrificed by intracardial perfusion with an ice-cold saline solution while the animals were
under chloroform anesthesia. the brain of each animal was
rapidly dissected and frozen onto a microtome chuck with
dry ice. cryostat sections (10 microns in thickness) were

serial slide-mounted tissue sections of rat brain (coronal sections
through the head of the caudate nucleus or through mid-cerebellar
levels) were incubated in 1 nm [:~h]-flunitrazepameither alone or in
the presence of various concentrations of the compounds listed
above. the sections were rinsed and then wiped from the slides for
radioactivity measurement by liquid scintillation counting. the ic:,,~

to displace 50% of the specific [:*h]-flunitrazepambinding.

taken through both the rostral forebrain (including caudate,
frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, etc) and cerebellum.
these sections were thaw-mounted onto cold, chromealum/gelatin coated microscope slides. the slide-mounted
tissue sections were then incubated for 60 minutes at 0-4°c
in 0.17 m tris-hcl buffer (ph 7.4) containing 1 nm [:*h]-flu
(84.3 ci-mmol, new england nuclear; boston, ma) followed by a 2-minute rinse in fresh buffer. these sections
represented total binding. triplicate sets of tissue sections of
either forebrain or cerebellum were incubated in buffered
media containing the radioactively-labeled flunitrazepam
plus various individual concentrations of the benzodiazepines
clonazepam, diazepam, desmethyldiazepam, alprazolam,
temazepam,  xxxd2140xxx ,  xxxd3058xxx ,  xxxd2255xxx , nitrazepam,
triazolam or the tpz compound cl218,872 (concentrations
ranged from 10 *im to 10 :*m). after rinsing, the sections
were wiped from the glass slides using microfiber glass filter
discs, and the radioactivity remaining in the tissue sections
were determined by conventional liquid scintillation counting techniques.
for autoradiography, slide-mounted tissue sections were
obtained as outlined above, from areas throughout the brain,
and incubated in the presence of [:*h]-flu alone (total binding)
or in the added presence of 200 nm cl218,872, 100 nm
 xxxd3058xxx , 100 nm  xxxd2255xxx , 20 nm  xxxd2140xxx , 30 nm
nitrazepam or 2 nm triazolam (these concentrations approximate the ic~,, values, that is, the amount of drug able to
displace 50%, of the specific binding of [:~h]-flu from the tis-

sue section), or in the presence of 1 micromolar clonazepam
as a control. these sections were dried on the slides using a
stream of cool, dry, filtered air and then apposed to sheets of
lkb ultrofilm (lkb instruments; rockville, md) in x-ray
cassettes (for review see [7~21]). autoradiograms generated
on the tritium-sensitive film were developed after a 2-week
exposure period and examined using a leitz orthoplan
(leitz, west germany) microscope. density measurements
of the autoradiographic grains appearing on the film were
made using a dads model 560 microdensitometer (an oki
computer interfaced with an mpv compact microphotometry system attached to the orthoplan microscope). these
readings were converted to femtomoles/mg tissue (wet
weight) by comparison to the grain densities generated by
tritium brain paste standards developed according to unnerstall e t a / . [20].
all drugs were generous gifts from the respective pharmaceutical agencies (clonazepam, diazepam, desmethyldiazepam, nitrazepam and  xxxd2140xxx  were from hoffmann
laroche, nutley, nj; cl218,872 was from lederle labs.,
pearl river, ny; alprazolam and triazolam were from upjohn, kalamazoo, mi; temazepam was from sandoz, inc., e.
hanover, nj; and  xxxd3058xxx  and  xxxd2255xxx  were from
schering corp., bloomfield, n j).

rim, 7.24 rim, 21.63 nm, 5.61 nm, 22.91 rim, 11.21 nm, 2.81
nm and 31.60 nm, respectively (table l). unlike these compounds, however, cl218,872,  xxxd3058xxx  and  xxxd2255xxx 
showed somewhat shallow displacement curves which indicated a deviation from simple michaelis-menten kinetics.
these compounds showed ic:,, values of 223.87 nm
(cl218,872), 89.13 nm ( xxxd3058xxx ), and 124.45 nm
( xxxd2255xxx ). hill plots of the data obtained from sections of
forebrain showed hill coefficients significantly less than 1
(p<0.05) for these latter three compounds while all of the
other benzodiazepines showed hill coefficients of 1 in these
same tissues. all of the compounds had hill coefficients
which approached unity when tested using sections of cerebellar tissues.
autoradiographic localization of [:~h]-flu binding in sections through the mesencephalon showed the presence of
high concentrations of benzodiazepine receptors in the
superficial lamina of the superior colliculus, molecular layer
of the dentate gyrus, retrosplenial cortex, periaqueductal
gray matter, mammillary bodies and substantia nigra. addition of 200 nm concentrations of cl218,872 to the incubation medium greatly attenuated the binding in the substantia
nigra while producing little perturbation of the binding in the
superior colliculus, dentate gyrus, retrosplenial cortex or
mammillary bodies (table 2; fig. 1). the binding in the
periaqueductal gray matter was partially reduced. using an
approximate ic:,,, value concentration of  xxxd3058xxx  or
 xxxd2255xxx  to displace [:*h]-flu binding produced a quantifiable pattern of labeling similar to that of cl218,872 (table
2). selective displacement of [:~h]-flu binding by these three
compounds was also seen in such regions as: lamina iv of
the cerebral cortex (fig. 2), the cingulate gyrus, the globus
pallidus, several thalamic nuclei, the zona incerta and the

heavy labeling is indicated
by the dark color seen in lamina iv of the cerebral cortex (iv) extending
medially into the cingulate cortex. a
lower grain density (indicating a lower  xxxd1459xxx  receptor density) is indicated by the higher shade of gray apparent in the caudate-putamen

in lamina iv (arrow),
but remains essentially
unchanged
in the

in the presence
of a 100 nm concentration
of  xxxd3058xxx .
the scan of this
