introduction

folate coenzymes function as acceptors and donors of onecarbon groups and are crucial for cellular homeostasis because
of participation in nucleotide biosynthesis and amino acid
metabolism [1]. the intracellular folate pool consists of several
major forms of the coenzyme that are interconvertible
through multiple reactions catalyzed by more than a dozen
enzymes [1,2]. intracellular folate pathways relevant to the
present studies are summarized in fig. 1. distribution of the
total intracellular folate pool between different forms of folate
coenzymes apparently depends on the relative levels of the
corresponding enzymes and the availability of metabolites
involved in folate-required pathways [3]. folate is an essential
nutrient since higher animals are unable to synthesize it and
depend on the diet to provide folate for cellular metabolism [4].
epidemiological studies have linked a low folate status, or a
low folate intake, with increased risk for several types of
cancer, neural tube defects, and cardiovascular diseases [5]. at
present, it is generally accepted that increased folate intake
decreases the risk of these diseases in humans [6]. cells obtain
folate as naturally occurring coenzyme form (food folate)
which is predominantly 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methylthf) or as the synthetic form which is  xxxd2146xxx  [7]. another
folate coenzyme often used in folate supplementation studies
is 5-formyl-thf (known therapeutically as  xxxd2462xxx  or
 xxxd2147xxx ) [8]. it is also widely used in chemotherapy to
reduce cytotoxic side effects of mtx [9], a potent inhibitor of
several folate enzymes [10].
one of the folate coenzymes, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate
(10-formyl-thf), is an essential substrate for two reactions of
de novo purine biosynthesis (fig. 1) [1], which are crucial for
cellular proliferation. this was demonstrated in experiments
with inhibitors of garft, the first folate dependent enzyme in
the de novo purine pathway: these inhibitors result in severe

fig. 1 – intracellular pathways involving conversion of 10formyl-thf. for simplicity, only pathways directly
relevant to the present work and corresponding enzymes
are depicted. abbreviations: ts,  xxxg2366xxx ;
thf, tetrahydrofolate; ch2, methylene; ch, methenyl.
enzymes directly involved in 10-formyl-thf metabolism
are: fdh; c1-synth, c1-synthase; enzymes of de novo
purine biosynthesis, garft and  xxxg209xxx . two reactions
catalyzed by dhfr are shown.

depletion of intracellular purine nucleotides followed by
suppressed cellular proliferation and cytotoxicity [11,12]. 10formyl-thf can be also metabolized by another enzyme, 10formyl-thf dehydrogenase (fdh). fdh catalyzes the nadp+dependent irreversible conversion of 10-formyl-thf to thf
and co2 [2,13]. although the physiological significance of this
reaction, apparently controlling intracellular levels of 10formyl-thf, is not clear, it could be a regulator of de novo
purine synthesis and could potentially restrict this pathway by
depleting intracellular 10-formyl-thf [14]. fdh is an abundant
enzyme in several tissues with highest levels observed in liver
and kidney [15]. in liver, for example, it comprises about 1.2%
of the total cytosolic protein [2,16]. in contrast to normal
tissues, the levels of this enzyme are ubiquitously low in a
number of human tumor tissues and cancer cell lines [15]. de
novo purine biosynthesis is especially active in rapidly
proliferating cells, like cancer cells, where it supplies a
substantial portion of purine nucleotides required for
enhanced cellular proliferation [17]. therefore, down-regulation of fdh could be one of the mechanisms to support the
increased purine biosynthesis, by maintaining higher intracellular concentrations of 10-formyl-thf.
we have previously demonstrated that elevating fdh in
fdh-deficient cancer cells inhibits proliferation and induces
cytotoxicity [15], which is consistent with observations of low
fdh in cancer cells. these results raised the question of why
fdh is not toxic to normal cells in contrast to cancer cells.
one explanation could be that fdh effects are associated
with the proliferation stage in general and therefore slowly
proliferating cells are insensitive to elevated fdh. however,
the finding of high fdh in regenerating liver, as well as in
some non-cancer cell lines [15], rather suggests that normal
cells have mechanisms that could protect them from fdhinduced cytotoxicity, and that in cancer cells these mechanisms are inactive. we have previously shown that the
cytotoxic effects of fdh can be partially reversed by
supplementation with high concentrations of  xxxd2462xxx 
[15]. thus, while fdh is a cytotoxic factor for cancer cells,
 xxxd2462xxx  is a rescue factor that alleviates the growth
suppressor effects of fdh. in the present study, using
 xxxd2462xxx  supplementation as a protective factor against
fdh suppressor effects, we have generated fdh-resistant
stable clones of the a549 cell line and evaluated potential
mechanisms of such resistance.

generation of dhfr expression vector

the translated portion of human dhfr cdna (ncbi access
number nm_000791) was pcr amplified from the total cdna
pool of a549 cells (generated with advantage rt-for-pcr kit,
clontech) using primers 50 -atggttggttcgctaaactgc-30
and 50 -ccttcatgttaatcattcttctc-30 . the amplified
564 bp fragment was cloned into pcr2.1 vector using tacloning kit (invitrogen). the dhfr cdna was then excised
from the construct by subsequent treatment with xhoi and
hindiii restriction enzymes; the xhoi end was blunted by
treatment with pfu turbo dna polymerase before restriction
the plasmid with hindiii. this fragment was cloned into
pcdna3.1 plasmid through a blunt end created by treatment
with aflii/pfu turbo, and hindiii site. the entire dhfr coding
region of the construct was sequenced to ensure absence of
mutations. sequencing has been performed by the musc
nucleic acid analysis facility.

interval, counted by trypan blue exclusion assay, and
replated. the first order growth rate constant (kg) was
calculated using the following equation: cðtþ ¼ c0  ekg t ,
where c(t) is the number of viable cells at specific time and
c0 is the number of viable cells at a time of cell plating [19]. the
actual doubling time (td) has been estimated as td = 0.693kg.
cell growth rates were evaluated from the double cell staining
by pi and pulse-labeling with brdu according to the published
report [19]. cells incubated with brdu for 1, 3 and 5 h were
harvested, fixed, and stained with fitc-conjugated anti-brdu
monoclonal antibody as described previously [18]. for staining
total dna, cells were incubated with pi and analyzed by facs
[18]. brdu labeled cells were considered to consist of two
populations: labeled dividing and labeled undividing cells. the
percentage of cells in each population was determined from
brdu/pi labeling using isocontour software (verity software
house, topsham, me).

2.6.
2.3.

cells at about 50% confluence were transfected with the
pcdna3.1/fdh construct (a549 cells) or pcdna3.1/dhfr
construct (a549 cells, clone atg10.26 [18]) using lipofectamine 2000 reagent (invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s directions. antibiotic  xxxg418xxx  (sigma) was added to the
culture medium at a concentration of 600 mg/ml 48 h later to
allow selection of transfected cells. every 24 h cells were
detached by treatment with trypsin and counted with a
hemocytometer. efficiency of transfection estimated by cotransfection with gfp-containing vector was about 35%.
experiments were performed in triplicate and data expressed
as the mean of the triplicates. protein expression was detected
by immunobloting analysis.

2.4.

analysis of dna content

cells (6  106) were labeled with brdu for 45 min using the in
situ proliferation kit, fluos (roche applied science, indianapolis, in), rinsed twice with pbs, detached by trypsin and
fixed with mixture of  xxxd102xxx  and 50 mm glycine, ph
2.0 at a ratio of 7:3, overnight at 4 8c. fixed cells were
denatured with 4 m hcl for 20 min at room temperature and
incubated in blocking solution for 10 min to prevent nonspecific binding. cells were incubated with fitc-labeled antibrdu antibodies for 45 min at 37 8c in a humidified chamber.
then the sample was labeled with  xxxd3027xxx  iodide (pi) using
cellular dna flow cytometric analysis kit (roche applied
science) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. brdu and pi
staining was analyzed by cell flow cytometry. flow cytometry
analysis was carried out in the hollings cancer center core
facility on a becton dickinson facscalibur. data analysis was
performed using cellquest and mod fit software (becton
dickinson, mountain view, ca).

assays of reduced folate pools

transfection

evaluation of cell growth characteristics

actual doubling time of resistant and non-resistant a549 cells
has been determined from regression analysis of cell number
as a function of time [19]. cells were harvested with 1-day

approximately 5  106 cells were collected and rapidly washed
three times with ice-cold pbs. the cell pellet was resuspended
in 50 mm tris–hcl buffer, ph 7.4, containing 50 mm sodium
ascorbate. cells were lysed by heating for 3 min in a boiling
water bath. cell lysates were chilled on ice and centrifuged for
5 min at 17,000  g at 4 8c. folate pools were measured in cell
lysates by the ternary complex assay method as described [20].
folate levels were calculated per mg of cellular protein
measured by bradford assay.

2.7.
assay of fdh activity and determination of kinetic
parameters
fdh activity at different 10-formyl-thf/thf ratios was
measured as we previously described [21]. the reaction
mixture contained 0.05 m tris–hcl, ph 7.8, 100 mm  xxxd26xxx ,
100 mm nadp+ and different concentrations of substrate, 10formyl-5,8-dideazafolate, and product, 5,8-dideazafolate
(ddf). the reaction was started by the addition of fdh
(10 mg) in a final volume of 1.0 ml and read against a blank
cuvette containing all components except fdh. increase in
concentration of product, ddf, was measured at 295 nm using
a molar extinction coefficient of 18.9  103. km and vmax were
determined from double reciprocal plots and ki was determined by plotting the apparent km versus inhibitor concentration as described elsewhere [22]. initial velocity of fdhcatalyzed reaction in resistant and sensitive cells was
calculated from the modified michaelis-menten equation,
v0 ¼ vmax ½s=ðð1 þ ð½i=ki þþkm þ ½sþ [22].

2.8.

immunoblot techniques

attached cells (about 1  106) were washed with pbs and
lysed by adding 50 mm tris–hcl buffer, ph 8.0 containing
0.15 m nacl, 2 mm edta, 1% triton x-100 and protease
inhibitors (sigma). cell lysates were subjected to sds-page
followed by immunobloting with the corresponding antibodies. fdh was detected using fdh-specific polyclonal
antiserum [15]; dhfr was detected using commercial
polyclonal antibodies (oncogene, san diego, ca); c1-

biochemical pharmacology 72 (2006) 256–266

synthase, garft and  xxxg209xxx  were detected using corresponding polyclonal antibodies generated against recombinant proteins. in all cases immunobloting procedures were
carried out using an ecl kit and hybond-c nitrocellulose
membranes (both from amersham bioscience corp., piscataway, nj) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

2.9.

clonogenic assay

atg10.26 cells capable of induced fdh expression [18] were
transfected with pcdna3.1 vector bearing dhfr cdna. in
control plates, cells were mock-transfected by ‘‘empty’’
pcdna3.1 plasmid. forty-eight hours after transfection,
doxycycline (2.5 mg/ml) was added into both the control and
experimental plates to induce fdh expression. formation of
clones under constant fdh induction was detected 14 days
post-transfection by staining with crystal violet [15]. the
medium was removed from the plates, the cells were rinsed
with pbs, fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 1 h, stained with
0.2% crystal violet for 20 min and clones were counted. in a
parallel experiment, clones were examined for fdh and dhfr
levels by immunoblot with corresponding specific polyclonal
antibodies.

statistical analysis

statistical analysis of the data was performed using student’s
t-test. p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

results

3.1.

generation of fdh-resistant a549 cells

we have previously shown that expression of fdh in fdhdeficient a549 cells induces strong cytotoxicity while addition
of  xxxd2462xxx  to these cells protects them from fdh
suppressor effects [15]. using high (10 mm)  xxxd2462xxx  supplementation of a549 cells transfected with the pcdna3.1/fdh
vector, we have selected clones that stably expressed fdh. in
these experiments transfected cells were selected by growing
in the presence of antibiotic,  xxxg418xxx : non-transfected cells did
not survive due to lack of antibiotic resistance. three weeks
post-transfection 13 clones that sustained elevated levels of
fdh in the presence of high  xxxd2462xxx  were obtained.
selected clones were then grown on regular medium
(2.2 mm  xxxd2146xxx , no  xxxd2462xxx ) with the anticipation that
after withdrawal of  xxxd2462xxx  proliferation would be inhibited and cells would die, as was observed in experiments with
transient transfection [15] and with tet-on a549 stable cells
capable of regulated fdh expression [18]. surprisingly, we
observed that these cells did not show signs of cytotoxicity
although they grew slower than the original a549 cells
(fig. 2a). immunoblot assays confirmed that these cells
express fdh at a level that would be toxic to the parental
a549 cells (fig. 2a, inset). growth characteristics of two more
clones were examined in the absence of  xxxd2462xxx  and they
also demonstrated resistance to elevated fdh (fig. 2b). thus,
in these experiments we have generated a549 cells (designated as a549/fdh-r) with the fdh resistant phenotype.

259

3.2.
fdh-resistant cells have prolonged s phase and
increased doubling time
fdh-resistant cells proliferate notably slower than the original
a549 cells with the doubling times of 26.0 and 20.5 h,
correspondingly. using bivariate brdu-dna analysis, we have
estimated times required for the resistant cells to traverse
different phases of the cell cycle. we have observed a
significant increase (40%) in s phase duration in a549 resistant
cells compared to the original cells (9.5  0.87 and 6.8  0.53 h,
correspondingly) while durations of other phases were only
slightly increased (fig. 2c). thus, the increase of the doubling
time in a549/fdh-r cells can be attributed mainly to the
prolonged s phase. the difference between the actual
doubling time and the calculated doubling time observed in
our experiments for both the parental cell line and fdh
resistant cell line should be attributed to the cell loss that is a
well known common feature of a growing cell population [23]
and is not associated with fdh elevation. in agreement with
the increased s phase duration, a549/fdh-r cells had higher
population of cells in s phase compared to the control nonresistant cells (fig. 2d). distribution of cells between the cell
cycle phases (fig. 2d) further confirmed that slower proliferation of the resistant cells was associated with slower
traversing s phase but not with g0/g1 or g2/m arrest.

3.3.

levels of reduced folate pools in fdh-resistant cells

to evaluate whether resistance against fdh could be caused
by changes in levels of reduced folates the following pools
were measured in a549/fdh-r and in the parental a549 cells:
combined thf and 5,10-methylene-thf; 10-formyl-thf; 5methyl-thf, combined folate and dihydrofolate. these coenzymes represent the major intracellular reduced folate pools
and the sum of their concentrations was considered as the
total folate pool. as expected based on the fdh-catalyzed
reaction, strong depletion of 10-formyl-thf in a549/fdh-r
compared to original a549 cells was observed (fig. 3). at the
same time, the combined thf/5,10-methylene-thf pool was
significantly increased. thus, the former was decreased
almost two-fold (from 14.2 to 7.4 pmol/mg of cellular protein)
while the latter was increased by 23 pmol/mg of protein (about
2.5-fold). two other pools, 5-methyl-thf and combined folate/
dihydrofolate, which are not directly related to fdh activity,
were also changed. while 5-methyl-thf was just slightly
decreased (from 8.8 to 7.4 pmol/mg of protein), combined
folate/dihydrofolate pool was increased more than twice
(from 2.2 to 4.6 pmol/mg of protein). overall, the total folate
pool was notably increased, by about 45%, in the resistant cells
compared to a549 cells (fig. 3). since intracellular folates were
measured long after  xxxd2462xxx  has been withdrawn as a
supplement, the observed folate levels are likely an intrinsic
property of the resistant cells.

function of the substrate concentration further confirmed
inhibitory effects of ddf (fig. 4b). double reciprocal plots
(fig. 4c) derived from these data have clearly shown that the
observed inhibition is competitive. the calculated ki for the
fdh reaction was 2.35 mm in the case of the synthetic
substrate and product, 10-formyl-ddf/ddf. in the case of
natural substrate and product, 10-formyl-thf and thf, ki was
1.92 mm.

3.5.
rate of fdh-catalyzed reaction at conditions of
fdh-sensitive and fdh-resistant cells
based on the measurements of 10-formyl-thf and thf/5,10methylene-thf pools we have calculated their concentrations
in fdh-sensitive a549 cells and in fdh-resistant a549/fdh-r
cells. the volume of a549 cell (1.7 ml corresponding to 106 cells)
was taken from [24]. we have also made an assumption that
cytosol comprises approximately 50% of the total cell volume
[25]. thus, in a549 cells concentrations were about 2 mm each
for 10-formyl-thf and thf/5,10-methylene-thf, while in
a549/fdh-r cells their concentrations were about 1 and 5 mm,
correspondingly. it has been reported that concentrations of
thf in cells are 1.5–3-fold higher than concentrations of 5,10methylene-thf [26,27]. accordingly, thf levels were estimated to be in the range of 1.2–1.6 mm in a549 cells and 3.0–
3.8 mm in the resistant cells. the calculated initial velocity of
fdh-catalyzed reaction was 0.083 mmol/min per mg for fdhsensitive a549 cells and 0.028 mmol/min per mg for fdhresistant a549 cells suggesting that in the resistant cells fdhcatalyzed reaction occurs at much slower rate.
we have also assayed fdh activity in an in vitro model
system in which ratios of 10-formyl-thf/thf corresponded
to those found in resistant and sensitive cells. in these studies
we used stable synthetic analogs of 10-formyl-thf and thf,
10-formyl-ddf and ddf. we have previously shown that 10formyl-ddf is an equally good substrate for fdh [28]. results

of these experiments corresponded well to the calculated
velocities giving further support for the hypothesis that in the
resistant cells fdh catalysis is inhibited due to an increased
concentration of thf (fig. 5). indeed, at conditions of these
cells, decreased concentrations of thf analog, ddf, resulted
in a significantly activated catalysis (fig. 5, compare curves 1,
2 and 3). in contrast, at conditions of fdh-sensitive cells
either omitting of ddf or increasing its concentration by twofold did not result in a critical shift in the reaction rate (fig. 5,
compare curves 4, 5, and 6).

concentrations of substrate, 10-formyl-ddf, either 2.0 mm
(dotted curves) or 1.0 mm (solid curves). concentrations of

cells. curve 5 (closed squares) models activity at
conditions of sensitive a549 cells. about 10 mg/ml fdh
was used in these assays.

3.6.
levels of reduced folate pools in a549 cells grown on
 xxxd2462xxx 
after supplementation of a549 cells with high  xxxd2462xxx 
concentrations (10 mm), a significant increase in all intracellular
folate pools was observed (fig. 6a). most of the increase
occurred by day 3 of the supplementation and was not changed
significantly at later times. interestingly, dihydrofolate pool was
strongly increased (four-fold) at day 3 after beginning  xxxd2462xxx  supplementation but dropped back to normal level at later
times (fig. 6a). three days after withdrawal of  xxxd2462xxx  from
the medium intracellular folate concentrations were decreased
essentially to the levels observed in the cells before  xxxd2462xxx 
supplementation (fig. 6b,  xxxd2462xxx  supplementation has been
withdrawn at day 22).

3.7.
cells

expression pattern of folate enzymes in fdh-resistant

we suggest that up-regulation of some folate enzymes could
contribute to fdh-resistance. moreover, it is likely that the
changes in reduced folates in a549/fdh-r cells were caused by
altered levels of other folate enzymes in addition to fdh. we
have evaluated levels of c1-synthase, the only mammalian

evaluated levels of dhfr, one of the key folate enzymes.
increased dhfr levels are often associated with resistance

against antifolates [29]. levels of  xxxg209xxx  were only slightly
increased in the resistant cells compared to a549 cells while
levels of garft and c1-synthase were unchanged (fig. 7). in
contrast, dhfr levels were highly increased indicating strong
overexpression of this enzyme in the resistant cells (fig. 7). in
the parental non-resistant a549 cells elevation of dhfr was
also observed after growing cells on high  xxxd2462xxx  (fig. 7).
there were no changes in c1-synthase levels in a549 cells at
these conditions and changes of garft/ xxxg209xxx  were rather
marginal (fig. 7).

dhfr by transient transfection in a549 cells capable of
inducible fdh expression (clone atg10.26 [18]). significant
elevation of dhfr protein was achieved in these experiments
48 h post-transfection (fig. 8a). we have observed that similar
to a549/fdh-r cells dhfr-expressing cells were less sensitive
to fdh antiproliferative effects (fig. 8b). thus, 4 days after
induction of fdh expression about 3.9 times more viable cells
were seen in the presence of elevated dhfr than at lower
dhfr levels. likewise, colony growth assay revealed that
prolonged culturing of cells with elevated dhfr under
constant fdh induction (these cells have high levels of both
dhfr and fdh) allows selection of fdh-resistant clones
(fig. 8c).

discussion

fdh, a folate-metabolizing enzyme, induces cytotoxicity upon
expression in fdh-deficient cancer cells [15]. in our studies
 xxxd2462xxx  rescued cells from fdh toxicity, resulting in
selection of a fdh-resistant phenotype. the progression of
tumors to malignancy depends on their ability to evolve into
heterogeneous phenotypes, a process that appears to involve
mainly quantitative changes in gene expression [30]. heterogeneous clones can also be a major contributor in the
emergence of refractory tumors [31]. therefore, it was
important to understand metabolic alterations that are
responsible for the resistant phenotype in our studies.
 xxxd2462xxx  is used clinically to elevate intracellular folate
levels [32]. in the cell, excess  xxxd2462xxx  is rapidly converted to
5,10-methenyl-thf and then to 5,10-methylene-thf [32].
alterations in intracellular reduced folate pools in response
to  xxxd2462xxx  supplementation are one of the mechanisms of
rescue from mtx toxicity [10,33,34]. on the other side,
elevation of intracellular 5,10-methylene-thf is the basis
for the application of  xxxd2462xxx  in combination with 5-

263

fluorouracil, an inhibitor of  xxxg2366xxx , in cancer
chemotherapy. thus, increased 5,10-methenyl-thf results in
stabilization of the ternary complex between thymidylate
synthase and the active 5-fluorouracil metabolite (5-fluorodeoxyuridylate) enhancing the enzyme inhibition [35]. in
agreement with the effect of  xxxd2462xxx  supplementation, the
combined thf/5,10-methylene-thf pool was strongly
increased in the resistant cells as well as the total intracellular
folate pool. however, elevated thf/5,10-methylene-thf and
the total folate pool in the resistant cells was maintained after
 xxxd2462xxx  supplementation was cancelled, suggesting that if
this mechanism took place during the earlier stage of clonal
selection, it was not directly responsible for the long-term
increase in total folate. indeed, evaluation of the intracellular
folates in regular a549 cells supplemented with  xxxd2462xxx  has
demonstrated that though an increase in intracellular folates
took place, it affected all folate pools and folate concentrations
rapidly returned to normal levels after the supplementation
was withdrawn.
supplementation with  xxxd2462xxx  resulted in an increase in
dhfr protein levels in a549 cells. the rescue of fdhexpressing cells after elevation of dhfr by transient transfection supports a role for the enzyme in the fdh resistant
phenotype. in the cell, dhfr reduces dihydrofolate, produced
in the reaction of thymidylate biosynthesis, to thf [1]. the
enzyme is also capable of reducing  xxxd2146xxx  to dihydrofolate
[1]. mechanistically, if extracellular folate is freely available in
the form of  xxxd2146xxx , and if reduced folates can be retained in
the cell, the elevation of dhfr would result in an increase in
the total intracellular thf pool through dihydrofolate as an
intermediate step. thus, increased levels of dhfr and thf as
well as dihydrofolate in a549/fdh-r cells implies enhanced
incorporation of  xxxd2146xxx  into the reduced folate pool
catalyzed by dhfr. elevated dhfr, together with elevated
fdh, can also contribute to the total folate increase by
providing more folate binding sites. it has been proposed that
most intracellular folate is protein-bound and the concentration of free coenzymes is very low [36,37]. together with the
fact that cellular folate levels are saturable, this has led to
conclusion that the accumulation of cellular folate is limited
by the folate binding capacity of the cell [4]. accordingly, an
increase in the number of folate-binding sites should allow the
retention of more intracellular folate resulting in its accumulation.
fdh possesses high binding affinity to thf [16] and it has
been suggested that fdh activity is regulated by the ratio of
10-formyl-thf to thf in liver [13]. thus, direct inhibition of
the fdh-catalyzed reaction, through tight binding in the fdh
catalytic center, could be a mechanism by which elevated
thf overcomes the suppressor effects of fdh. our kinetic
studies have demonstrated that the product of the fdhcatalyzed reaction is indeed a strong competitive inhibitor of
the enzyme. therefore, the ratio of 10-formyl-thf/thf
shifted towards thf is unfavorable for the fdh-catalyzed
reaction. our results indicate that the initial rate of the fdhcatalyzed reaction is about three-fold slower in the resistant
cells than in the parental sensitive cells. further evaluation
of fdh enzymatic activity in a model system confirmed that
at the substrate/product ratios observed in the resistant
cells, fdh catalysis is significantly inhibited. thus, fdh is

mechanism of fdh resistance. abbreviations: lu,
 xxxd2462xxx ; thf, tetrahydrofolate; 10-cho-thf, 10-formylthf; dhf, dihydrofolate. the proposed mechanism of fdh
resistance includes three steps: (1) lu induces dhfr
elevation; (2) elevated dhfr increases rate of conversion of
 xxxd2146xxx , absorbed from the media, to thf; (3) increased
thf inhibits fdh thus blocking conversion of 10-formylthf to thf and preserving 10-formyl-thf pool.

dhfr. (a) left panel, levels of fdh and dhfr in a549 cells
(clone atg10.26 [18]) (s) and in the same cells transiently
transfected with dhfr-expressing vector (+). in both cases
cells were treated with doxycycline to induce fdh
expression. right panel shows levels of the enzymes in
stable clones (panel c) expressing dhfr (14 days dhfr
post-transfection). (b) growth inhibitory effects of fdh on
atg10.26 cells with (+dhfr) and without (control)
elevated dhfr. viable cells were counted by trypan blue
exclusion assay 4 days after transfection with dhfrexpressing vector. fdh expression was induced by
addition of 2.5 mg/ml doxycycline 12 h after transient
transfection with dhfr expressing vector. mean w s.e. of
two independent experiments performed in triplicate are

not fully functional in the resistant cells due to product
inhibition.
an interesting question is, what is the mechanism of dhfr
elevation in a549/fdh-r cells? intracellular dhfr concentrations are regulated at transcriptional [38], translational [39,40]
and protein [41] levels. it is possible that the mechanism of
dhfr up-regulation in fdh-resistant cells is related to an
increase of intracellular dihydrofolate and is similar to
translational up-regulation of dhfr by mtx [42]. it has been
demonstrated that translation of dhfr mrna is repressed by
the binding of dhfr protein [29]. binding of mtx as well as
dihydrofolate to the enzyme results in the release of mrna
from this complex and activates translation [29]. numerous
studies have shown nearly quantitative conversion of  xxxd2462xxx  to dihydrofolate (see [10] and references therein). in
agreement with this mechanism, a strong elevation of the
dihydrofolate pool and dhfr levels was seen in our studies
following the beginning of  xxxd2462xxx  supplementation.
alternatively, well-known dhfr gene amplification, which
can support elevated dhfr for many cell generations [10],
could not be ruled out as a mechanism of dhfr elevation in
fdh-resistant cells.
overall, our studies demonstrate that dhfr up-regulation in
a549 cells causes acquired resistance against fdh antiproliferative effects. the down-stream event is a significant
elevation of intracellular thf (fig. 9) resulting in fdh inhibition.
importantly, this mechanism can be activated by  xxxd2462xxx .
 xxxd2462xxx  is often used in combination with mtx or 5fluorouracil in chemoprevention treatments [9,37]. our studies

shown. (c) clonal growth assay of atg10.26 cells
transfected with dhfr-expressing vector (+dhfr) and
with the ‘‘empty’’ vector (control). during the clonal
selection the cells were permanently induced with
doxycycline for fdh expression. clones were stained 14
days after transfection.

indicate that  xxxd2462xxx  itself selects for an abnormal phenotype that could potentially result in more refractory tumors. it is
unclear at present to what extent the dhfr-induced mechanism of fdh resistance is relevant to normal cells. with regard to
this question, it should be noted that a549/fdh-r cells require
longer time to traverse s phase, which implies that most of the
fdh suppressor effects are associated with this phase of the cell
cycle. dhfr, an s phase enzyme, is strongly activated during
transition from g1 to s phase when the cell initiates s phaserelated synthetic processes to prepare for division [38]. therefore, dhfr-induced repression of fdh catalysis could be an s
phase-related metabolic adjustment that protects cells against
fdh suppressor effects.
