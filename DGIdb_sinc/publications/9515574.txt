it has been argued that the antiproliferative
activity of
this class of agents is due largely to their perturbation of
mitosis [lo, 111, resulting from their alteration of the
microtubular dynamics of the mitotic spindle [12]. at the
lowest effective in vitro concentrations,
vinca alkaloids were
shown to block microtubule dynamics by reducing the rate
of tubulin addition and loss at microtubule ends [13].
higher drug concentrations
resulted in extensive microtubular disassembly and still higher concentrations
induced
formation of tub&n paracrystals [14]. however, it is becoming clear that the various vinca alkaloids differentially
inhibit tubulin function, even if they all bind to the same
site or sites on tub&n dimers [15, 161. in addition, having

were

determined using a standard growth inhibition assay. exponentially growing l1210 cells (1.5 x lo5 cells/well) in a
24-well plate were exposed to a range of concentrations
of
test compounds for 48 hr, prior to determining cell numbers
using an electronic particle counter (coultronics).
effects
of test compounds on the in vitro proliferation of p388 cells
and of all the human tumour cell lines were determined
using a standard mtt-based calorimetric assay [20], with
minor modifications.
exponentially
growing tumour cells
were exposed to a range of concentrations
of each test
compound for a 72 hr incubation period, before mtt (1
mg/ml in rpm1 1640 without phenol red) was added to
each well, followed 3 hr later after centrifugation by 0.1 ml
dmso to allow formazan solubilisation. plates were then
shaken before reading at 570 nm, using a microplate reader
(mr7000,
dynatech laboratories). for all tests, the final
steps were followed by computerised data acquisition and
processing, using in-house custom-made
programs. i+~
values, i.e. concentration
of compound required to reduce
absorbance or cell number to 50% of that of control cells,
were then determined from replicates of 6 from at least two
independent experiments using another in-house program
based on linear interpolation

between data points.

flow cytometry
flow cytometry analysis of cellular dna content by  xxxd3027xxx  iodide staining was performed as described previously [21]. logarithmically growing p388 cells were incubated with solvent or test compound for 18 hours prior to
centrifugation
(4”, 250 x g, 10 min), washed twice with

r.lg/ml)and  xxxg1963xxx  (100 pg/ml, ph 7.6) for a further 10
min and then staining with a  xxxd3027xxx 
( xxxd3027xxx  iodide 416 pg/ml and  xxxd3234xxx  tetrahydrochloride 1160 fg/ml, ph 7.6) for at least 15 min at 4” in
the dark. samples were analysed using an epics elite flow
cytometer (coulter corporation)
and the percentage of
cells was calculated in the g,, s and gz + m phases using
multicycle software (phoenix flow systems).

5 min and resuspension of the resultant cell pellet in 1 ml 75
mm kc1 at 4”. after 20 min, 1 ml methanol-acetic acid (3:l)
as fixative was added slowly under constant mild agitation.
cells were then repelleted and washed twice with 1 ml of
fixative, before being resuspended in fixative and dispensed
onto glass slides. after drying, samples were stained with
giemsa solution [22]. four hundred cells/treatment were
scored for the presence of mitotic figures by optical microscopy
(nikon, subra) and the mitotic index was calculated as the
proportion of cells with mitotic figures. results are expressed
as means from three independent experiments, associated with
the standard error of the estimate of the mean value.

assays were performed as described by sackett and varma
[29]. briefly, 0.3 mg/ml of purified tubulin were preincubated for 30 min at 30” with or without an excess of test
compound and then digested on ice with 5 p,g/ml of
chymotrypsin or trypsin for 30 min. enzyme action was
halted by the addition of 10 mm pmsf (for chymotrypsin)
or 1 mm leupeptin (for trypsin). then, samples were
separated on sds-polyacrylamide
12% minigels (bio-rad).
gels were stained with coomassie blue r.

measurement

microtubular proteins were prepared from sheep brain by
three cycles of assembly and disassembly, as described
previously [24]. the final pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer (100 mm pipes ph 6.6, 0.5 mm mgcl,, 0.1
mm edta, 1 p,m egta) and stored in liquid nitrogen
before use or further purification.
maps (microtubule
associated proteins) were separated from tubulin by ionexchange chromatography
(sp, pharmacia)
in 50 mm
pipes buffer ph 6.6, 0.5 mm egta, 0.25 mm mgcl, and
0.25 mm gtp [25]. tubulin was eluted in the void volume
and maps in the fraction eluted by the addition of 0.8 m
nacl to the same buffer. fractions containing
purified
tubulin were pooled and stored in liquid nitrogen before

actiwity

gtpase activity was determined by measuring the release of
j3p from [33p]y-gtp, as described by hamel and lin [30].
experimental conditions were comparable to those used for
following the assembly or disassembly of purified tubulin.
purified tubulin was incubated for 30 min at 37” in the
presence of [33p]y-gtp
(2 ci/mol, 50 pci/ml). ten
microlitres

of the reaction

mixture were then mixed with

40 pl of 25% acetic acid before spotting 10 p,l of this
mixture onto 20 x 20 pei-cellulose thin-layer chromatography sheets (macherey-nagel).
the sheets were soaked in
methanol for 5 min, air-dried and then soaked in water for

a standard.

2 min before being subjected to ascending chromatography
with 1.0 m khzpo,. membranes were dried, exposed to a
gs525 molecular imager system (bio-rad) and scanned
using a phosphorlmager (bio-rad). patterns of [33p]y-gtp

in vitro microtubule

assembly or disassembly was followed

turbidimetrically as described by gaskin and cantor [27],
by quantitating variations in absorbance at 350 nm using a
spectrophotometer
(du 640, beckman)
equipped with
thermostatically-controlled
cuvettes.
turbidity
experiments were conducted with 2.3 mg/ml solutions of microtubular proteins in assembly buffer containing
100 mm
pipes ph 6.6, 0.5 mm mgcl,, 0.1 mm edta, 1 p,m
egta and 2 mm gtp. solutions, initially at o”, were
warmed to 37” to initiate assembly, then after 12 min at
37”, the temperature was decreased to 0” again to induce
disassembly. when
mixtures containing

purified tubulin was used, reaction
2 mg/ml of purified tubulin in 700

mm monosodium glutamate ph 6.6, 1 mm mgclz and
0.4% dmso were preincubated at 37” for 15 min without
gtp, chilled on ice for 10 min and 0.4 mm gtp then
added at the same time as the test compound [28]. turbidity
of the tubulin solution was determined at both 0” and 37”,
as described previously. the ickyvalues for inhibition of
assembly or disassembly were those concentrations
that
reduced assembly or disassembly by 50% as compared to
solvent controls, as determined from five independent
experiments (or two independent experiments for inactive
compounds), using an in-house program.

the extent of binding of radiolabelled-vinca alkaloids was
followed by a centrifugal gel filtration method described
previously [28]. tubulin obtained from sheep brain by three
cycles of assembly/disassembly was incubated at 0.5 mg/ml
for 20 min at 22” with [3h]vinca alkaloids (0.1 mci/ml), in
100 mm pipes ph 7,0.5 mm mgcl,, 2% (v/v) dmso, in
the presence or absence of an unlabelled competitor compound at a selected concentration,
in a final volume of 0.5
ml. duplicate or triplicate aliquots (0.15 ml) of this
reaction mixture were applied to 1 ml microcolumns of
sephadex g-50 superfine, which were then centrifuged at
900 x g for 4 min at 4”. protein and radioactivity in the
filtrates were determined, using the lowry method [26] and
a b liquid scintillation counter (205 tr, packard), respectively. the binding of [3h]vinca alkaloids to tubulin was
evaluated by calculating the ratio of the amount of bound
[‘hicompound to tubulin per amount of total microtubular
protein for each sample as average values of duplicates or
triplicates.

ratio of each sample was expressed

the [3h]com-

control experiments showed that no radioactivity passed
through the column in the absence of protein. using
eppendorf plastic tubes (66-3 17, polylabo), relatively weak
adsorption (510%)
occurred during the incubation
of
[3h]vinca alkaloids or [3h]colchicine at 22” or 37”, respectively.

tubulin

alkylation

effects of drugs on the alkylation of tubulin by iodoacetamide were studied as described by luduefia and roach
[31], with minor modifications. tub&n
(0.7 mg/ml) was
incubated for 2 hr at 37” in the reaction buffer (100 mm
pipes ph 6.4, 0.5 mm mgcl,, 0.1 mm egta and 1 mm
gtp)
in the presence of 100 p,m of test compound.
iodo[14c] xxxd63xxx ,
diluted with cold iodoacetamide to a
final concentration of 1.3 mm and a specific activity of 1.92
ci/mol, was immediately added to the prepared incubation
mixture of tubulin for a second incubation of o-2 hr at 37”.
at each time point, the alkylated tubulin was precipitated
by dilution with an equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic
acid (tca)
at 4”. precipitates were collected on gf/c
filters (whatman),
washed 3 times with 10% (v/v) tca
and with 95% (v/v) ethanol, before being added to 4 ml
scintillation solution (ultragold xr, packard) for radioactivity counting. the amount of iodo[‘4c] xxxd63xxx 
bound
to tubulin was evaluated by calculating the ratio of the
number of moles of bound iodo[‘4c] xxxd63xxx 
per mole of
tub&n.
mean values were calculated from two separate
experiments,

performed in triplicate using two independent

on cell proliferation

data in fig. 2 illustrate that the cytotoxicity of vinflunine
against cultured l1210 murine leukaemia cells is strongly
dependent both on concentration
and on duration of
exposure. negligible cytotoxicity resulted from a 6-hr exposure, consistent with vinflunine exerting its lethal effects
at one or more specific phases of the cell cycle (see below).
however, by prolonging the exposure period to 24 or 48 hr,
a plateau-shaped dose-response curve was noted, indicating
that once a certain concentration
is achieved, cell kill
becomes more dependent on increased exposure duration
than on concentration,
an observation consistent with that
observed in classic vinca alkaloids [32].
the study was then extended to include one more
murine leukaemia cell line and a panel of nine human
tumour cell lines (table i), and the results obtained with
vinflunine were compared to those obtained with  xxxd3516xxx , vinblastine or vincristine under identical experimental conditions. a common feature of all the dose-response

effects of vinflunine on cell cycle distribution
the results of flow cytometric analyses of cellular dna
content of i’388 leukaemic cells using  xxxd3027xxx  iodide
staining (fig. 4) indicate that an 18-hr incubation (approximately one population doubling time) with vinflunine
induced

a dose-dependent

of p388 cells in

the g, + m phases of the cell cycle. control cells and those
incubated with 10 nm vinflunine had 12 + 1.2 and 13 -c

higher concentrations

4.8% of the population, respectively accumulated in gz +

peak corresponding to amounts of dna lower than in the
gl-phase was most likely due to cell fragmentation.

cells showed a rich and intact cytoplasmic microtubular
cytoskeleton
(figs. 5a and 5b), whereas vinflunine induced a concentration-dependent
reduction of their microtubular network (figs. 5c-5f).
after exposure to 0.5 p-m
vinflunine, wide cytoplasmic areas were apparent with a
low microtubule content, while the remaining microtubules
localised around the nucleus (figs. 5c and 5d). at 1 p-m,
vinflunine induced a more marked effect on the microtubular network of these a-10 cells, and only a few short
microtubules remained around the nuclei (figs. 5e and 5f),
with some cells appearing to have completely lost their
microtubules.
under these conditions,
 xxxd3516xxx 
and
vinblastine induced similar effects, except that
mately 5-fold and 20-fold lower concentrations,

approxirespec-

tively, were sufficient to cause complete microtubular
network disruption (data not shown). in addition, no
microtubular bundles were observed in a-10 cells treated
with vinflunine, suggesting that this new derivative did not
stab&se microtubules. it was also notable that at concentrations that induced a marked reduction of the microtubular cytoskeleton,
neither vinflunine,

nor

modified the actin network, another major
constituent of the cellular cytoskeleton (data not shown).

suggest that these four vinca alkaloids may exert differential
effects on the conformation of the tubulin molecule, with
vinflunine acting in a similar manner to  xxxd3516xxx  and
quite different from that of vinblastine and vincristine.

discussion
vinflunine, a novel fluorinated synthetic analogue of  xxxd3516xxx , has shown marked in viva antitumour activity,
with good overall tolerance in preclinical models, one
which was generally superior to that of the other vinca
alkaloids, including  xxxd3516xxx , tested concurrently
[19].
in attempting to define the basis for this enhanced spectrum of antitumour activity, the effects of vinflunine within
ceils and on tubulin function in vitro have been analysed.

the first series of studies provide clear evidence that
vinflunine exhibited several characteristics
in common
with the other vinca alkaloids, but differences were identified in certain tubulin-interacting
properties of this compound and these were examined in more detail in the
second series of investigations.
vinflunine induced a concentration-dependent
inhibition of l1210 cell growth, featuring a steep dose-response
curve indicative of a narrow dose range of cytotoxicity
commonly observed with vinca alkaloids. vinflunine cytotoxicity also increased with exposure duration. survival
curves for two murine leukaemia and nine human solid
tumour cell lines were all exponential-plateau
type, characteristic of class ii agents in the kinetic classification of
antitumour
agents [36, 371. the implication
of this
classification is that once the plateau-level concentration

gtp hydrolysis [25]. in this respect, therefore, vinflunine
appears to function as a specific inhibitor of tubulin
assembly, like the classic vinca alkaloids.
however, vinflunine
also expressed some distinctive
features in terms of its binding to free tubulin and its ability
to compete for the binding with the other [3h]vinca
alkaloids. under the conditions used, vinflunine did not

appear to compete at all with [3h]vincristine,
and only
slightly inhibited the binding of [3h]vinblastine and [3h] xxxd3516xxx  when used at the highest concentration

p,m. this quantitative difference might be due to a higher
dissociation constant for vinflunine than for the other
vinca alkaloids,

permitting

be-

tween bound and free vinflunine to be easily displaced in
favour of free drug during the course of an experiment based
on the centrifugal gel filtration technique. support for this
hypothesis also comes from evaluating the effects of vinflunine, relative to the other vinca alkaloids, on tubulin
conformation.
results of monitoring
alkylation of the
sulfhydryl groups of tubulin by iodo[‘4c] xxxd63xxx 
[31]
showed that with vinflunine, inhibition of tubulin alkylation was only transitory, being reversed after two hours of
incubation,
vinblastine

unlike the persistent inhibition noted with
and vincristine. interestingly,  xxxd3516xxx  ap-

peared to act in the same manner as vinflunine.
an
alternative explanation for these data might be that only a
very low proportion of vinflunine is ‘available’ to bind to
free tubulin and that the drug’s cytotoxicity is mediated by

between log q. values, obtained when evaluating cytotoxicities against a panel of nine unselected human tumour cell
lines, for vinflunine,  xxxd3516xxx  or vincristine relative to
vinblastine are consistent with all these compounds having

another mechanism.
in this respect, the report by de
arruda et al. [40] on a new synthetic derivative of dolastatin
10, lu103793,
is of interest. lu103793,
while inducing
similar overall biological effects on tub&n as vinblastine,
could not be detected as binding to tubulin, nor as

a similar intracellular target. vinflunine resulted in similar
overall biological effects to those of other vinca alkaloids

inhibiting
the binding of vinblastine
tubulin. however, by video microscopy,

[38] on mammalian tumour cells in witro, causing cell cycle
arrest at g, + m, associated with an accumulation of cells

lu103793 bound to microtubule ends with high affinity at
low concentrations,
suggesting that its cytotoxic activity

in mitosis and producing a concentration-dependent
reduction of the microtubule network, together with the formation of paracrystalline structures at high concentrations [39]

was associated

in interphase cells. however, these effects, which all proved
to be concentration-dependent,
generally required 3- to
17-fold higher concentrations
of vinflunine relative to
those of the other vincas tested. this finding appears
consistent with the relatively higher levels of vinflunine
needed to inhibit tumour cell proliferation in vitro and in
wiuo, as well as to increase the survival of tumour-bearing
animals [19]. in vitro studies have established that vinflunine prevents assembly of microtubules without affecting
their disassembly, with an ickyvalue similar to those noted
with vincristine, vinblastine or  xxxd3516xxx .
in addition,
vinflunine appears to interact at the vinca alkaloid binding
site on tubulin. this was shown first using a test based on
the differential proteolysis of purified tubulin by chymotrypsin or trypsin [35] and confirmed by the fact that
vinflunine, when permitted to interact with tubulin, induced structural changes which favoured an inhibition of

or colchicine
to

dynamics [41].
in considering the capacity of a compound to bind to
tub&n
or to interfere with the binding of [3h]vinca
alkaloids to tubulin under our experimental conditions, our
data indicate that the various vinca alkaloids tested can be
classified as follows: vincristine > vinblastine >  xxxd3516xxx  > vinflunine. these results are in agreement with
other published data, since vincristine is known to bind to
tubulin with a higher overall affinity than vinblastine [15,
42, 431. more recently, lobert et al. [16] found the same
order in comparing the interaction of  xxxd3516xxx  with
tubulin with that of vincristine and vinblastine. therefore,
it would appear that vinflunine may further extend this
vinca alkaloid classification based on overall binding affinities.
however, the strength of binding to tubulin is not
necessarily related to antitumour efficacy. for example,
singer and himes [15] reported that the relative binding
affinities to bovine brain tubulin of vincristine,  xxxd3513xxx ,

mechanism of action of vinflunine, a new vinca alkaloid

vinblastine

and vinepidine

were inversely correlated

647

with

their effects on b16 tumour cell proliferation, with vinepidine interacting with tubulin with the highest affinity, yet
being the least efficient inhibitor of proliferation. in this
respect, it may be noteworthy that while  xxxd3516xxx  and
vinflunine differ in terms of their catharanthine
moities,
vinblastine, vincristine and  xxxd3513xxx  are modified in their
vindoline portions. our results highlight the fact that single
structural changes either in the vindoline or in the catharanthine parts of the molecule can independently alter the
overall tubulin binding affinities/interactions.
interestingly,
these effects seem to be additive for vinepidine, which is
modified in both moieties. furthermore, jordan et al. [44]
showed that retardation of tumour growth resulting from
b16 melanoma cells treated with drug before being injected
into mice was best achieved with  xxxd3513xxx , one of the
weaker inhibitors of net addition of tubulin dimers at
assembly ends of steady-state microtubules,
relative to
vincristine, vinblastine and vinepidine. this apparent lack
of correlation
may be due to the fact that the vinca
alkaloids are concentrated
intracellularly and accumulate
differentially in certain cells or that they actually target
other intracellular sites, as discussed by jordan et al. [45].
ongoing investigations aimed at defining other parameters
implicated in the antitumour activity of this new compound include monitoring the cellular uptake and accumulation, apoptosis induction, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic properties of vinflunine, as well as identifying any
non-tubulin-related
targets.
if, however, tubulin is considered to be the primary target
of vinca alkaloids, it can be expected that differential
interactions with tubulin should correlate to some extent
with differences in their clinical utilities. the classification
we have proposed above, based on their relative capacities
to interfere

with

the binding

of [3h]vinca

alkaloids

to

tubulin, inversely correlates with the amount of drug
required to induce mitotic accumulation of l1210 cells, to
disassemble
the microtubular
network and to induce
paracrystals in a-10 cells. lobert et al. [16] suggested that
since their defined order of overall tubulin binding affinities, namely: vincristine
> vinblastine
>  xxxd3516xxx ,
correlated well with the weekly intravenous drug dose of
each vinca alkaloid used in the clinic, namely 0.4-1.4,
4-20 and 25-35 mg/m2, respectively, differential effects on
microtubule dynamics might correlate clinically with the
amount of drug needed to suppress tumour growth, which is
determined not only by the potency of the drug but also by
its dose-limiting toxicities.
in conclusion, we have synthesised a uniquely fluorinated  xxxd3516xxx  derivative that appears to function as a
specific inhibitor of tubulin, while exhibiting tubulin binding properties at least quantitatively different from those of
the other vinca alkaloids. these results with vinflunine
therefore permit an extention of the spectrum of tubulin
binding properties beyond that of  xxxd3516xxx  relative to
the more classic vincu alkaloids. while these data may not
f u 11y account for the markedly superior spectrum of in viva

preclinical antitumour activity identified with vinflunine,
results of clinical testing of this novel compound are eagerly
awaited to establish whether its use can improve on the
major clinical activity already identified with  xxxd3516xxx
