abstract
we have investigated the role of  xxxd3105xxx  (retinoid) proteins in hepatic retinoid processing under normal conditions and during
chemical stress induced by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (tcdd), a chemical known to interfere with retinoid turnover and
metabolism. three separate studies were performed in wildtype control mice and transgenic mice that lack one or more isoforms
of  xxxd3417xxx  receptors (rar), retinoid x receptors (rxr), or intracellular retinoid-binding proteins (crabp i, crabp
ii,  xxxg1938xxx  i). body and organ weight development was monitored from 2 weeks of age to adult, and hepatic levels of retinyl
esters, retinol, and  xxxd3417xxx  were investigated. in addition, hepatic concentrations of 9-cis-4-oxo-13,14-dihydro-retinoic
acid, a recently discovered retinoid metabolite that has proven sensitive to both tcdd exposure and  xxxd3105xxx  status, were also
determined. mice absent in the three proteins  xxxg1938xxx  i, crabp i, and crabp ii (ci/cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− ) displayed significantly lower
hepatic retinyl ester, retinol, and  xxxd3417xxx  levels compared to wildtype mice, whereas the liver concentrations of
9-cis-4-oxo-13,14-dihydro- xxxd3417xxx  was considerably higher. after treatment with tcdd, hepatic total retinoids were almost
entirely depleted in the ci/cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− mice, whereas wildtype mice and mice lacking crabp i, and crabp ii (cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− )

retained approximately 60–70% of their  xxxd3105xxx  content compared to controls at 28 days. rar and rxr knockout mice
responded similarly to wildtype mice with respect to tcdd-induced retinoid disruption, with the exception of rxr␤−/− mice
which showed no decrease in hepatic  xxxd3105xxx  concentration, suggesting that the role of rxr␤ in tcdd-induced retinoid
disruption should be further investigated. overall, the abnormal retinoid profile in the triple knockout mice (ci/cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− ),
but not double knockout (cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− ) mice, suggests that a loss of  xxxg1938xxx  i may account for the difference in retinoid profile
in ci/cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− mice, and is likely to result in an increased susceptibility to hepatic retinoid depletion following dioxin
exposure.

1. introduction
the retinoid-signaling pathway involves binding
of  xxxd3417xxx  to the specific  xxxd3417xxx  receptors rar and rxr, which affect the transcriptional
activity of several genes [1,2]. the different subfamilies of rar and rxr (␣, ␤, ␥) and their isoforms
(␣1, ␣2, etc.) are believed to elicit finely tuned and
highly specific cellular responses via activation of variably organized response elements (rare, rxre) in
the cell nucleus [3,4]. previous characterizations of
mice lacking one or several retinoid receptors during
development have been fundamental for the present
knowledge of retinoid signaling pathways [5]. however, these studies have only poorly investigated the
role of the retinoid receptors and retinoid binding proteins in maintaining retinoid homeostasis in the adult.
mice lacking a single retinoid receptor isoform have
revealed no major phenotypical differences from wildtype mice under protected laboratory conditions, which
is likely due to the redundancy in the retinoid signaling system [6–8]. the highly conserved sequence
of the various retinoid receptors through evolution,
though, suggests that there may be subtle differences
in the knockouts that become evident in phenotypic
alterations only when the animal is put in a stressed situation, for example when submitted to nutrient deprivation or exposed to environmental stressors.
the intracellular carrier proteins for retinoids; the
 xxxg1938xxx  ( xxxg1938xxx ) and cellular
 xxxd3417xxx -binding protein (crabp), have been suggested to affect the synthesis and/or metabolism of
 xxxd3417xxx  and hence the availability of ligands to the
receptors rar and rxr [9]. two isoforms of  xxxg1938xxx 
and two of crabp are well known and more recently,
two additional  xxxg1938xxx  isoforms have been identified in

murine and human tissues [10,11]. the crbps facilitate hepatic retinol uptake by cells and the esterification
of retinol for retinyl ester storage, and/or reduce retinal
produced from ␤-carotene into retinol [12,13]. more
unclear is the extent of their involvement in retinol oxidation to  xxxd3417xxx  [9]. the roles of crabp i and ii
in cellular retinoid processing have recently been elucidated; whereas crabp i may increase oxidation of
 xxxd3417xxx  and diminish the cell’s responsiveness to
 xxxd3417xxx  action [14], crabp ii seems to deliver
 xxxd3417xxx  directly to the receptors and thereby
enhance the responsiveness to  xxxd3417xxx 
signaling [15,16]. phenotypic characterizations have
been done previously of mice lacking  xxxg1938xxx  i, crabp
i, or crabp ii [12,17,18]. all of these mutants appear
normal when bred under protected laboratory conditions, with the exception of extra for- and hindlimb
digit rudiments observed in mice lacking crabp ii
[18]. crabp double mutant mice do not differ from
wt mice even after treatment with excess  xxxd3417xxx 
[18]. however, how these mice are affected by vitamin
a deficiency has not been studied as yet. transgenic
mice lacking  xxxg1938xxx  i display reduced hepatic retinoid
storage capacity in accordance with earlier studies that
indicated a role for  xxxg1938xxx  i in retinol transfer from
hepatocytes to hepatic stellate cells for storage as well
as in the actual retinol esterification reaction [13,19].
the defect becomes more severe when the  xxxg1938xxx  i−/−
mouse encounters  xxxd3105xxx  deficiency, a condition
which should have been frequent through evolution
and thus provides an explanation for the high degree
of interspecies homology of this protein [9].
polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (pcdds),
dibenzofurans (pcdfs), and biphenyls (pcbs)
are able to interfere with  xxxd3105xxx  storage and
metabolism in mammals, although the underlying

p. hoegberg et al. / chemico-biological interactions 156 (2005) 25–39

mechanisms are not yet fully clarified [20]. the mechanisms may include adverse interactions with one or
several of the retinoid-specific receptors, enzymes,
and/or binding proteins, all of which are crucial for
normal  xxxd3105xxx  status. 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzop-dioxin (tcdd), commonly used as the model
compound of this large family of dioxin-like food
contaminants, elicits a wide array of biochemical and
pathological effects on mammals, including weight
loss, hyperkeratosis, liver enlargement, thymus atrophy, immunosuppression, tumor promotion, impaired
reproduction, and embryo toxicity [21]. effects of
tcdd on  xxxd3105xxx  processing include an early
increase in retinoid mobilization from retinyl ester
stores [22–25], altered retinol esterification [26,27],
altered tissue levels of  xxxd3417xxx  [27–29], increased
whole-body turnover of retinoids [29], and increased
excretion of polar retinoid metabolites [22,30]. the
liver seems to be an important target organ in dioxindisrupted  xxxd3105xxx  status. we hypothesized that
mice lacking various genes in the retinoid signaling
pathway would constitute a powerful tool to study the
molecular basis of tcdd-induced retinoid disruption.
in the present study, we investigated mice lacking
both alleles for one or all isoforms of rar␣, rar␤,
rxr␤, and rxr␥ to reveal possible alterations in
retinoid processing under normal conditions or following chemical stress. we also investigated mice lacking
one allele of the rxr␣ gene (rxr␣+/− ). moreover, we
studied mice lacking crabp i and ii (cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− ),
as well as mice lacking the three binding proteins  xxxg1938xxx 
i, crabp i, and crabp ii (ci/cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− ), to elucidate the role of these binding proteins in maintaining
retinoid stores under normal conditions or following
chemical stress. through the use of these knockout
mice in separate experiments we investigated the role of
these genes in well established dioxin exposure-related
effects, i.e. liver enlargement, thymus atrophy, diminished body weight gain, depletion of liver retinoids, and
cytochrome p450 (cyp) 1a induction.

2. materials and methods
2.1. chemicals
for the exposure study using rar and rxr
knockout mice, >99% pure tcdd was purchased

27

from promochem (wesel, germany). the tcdd used
for the exposure study on binding protein knockouts was a pool from different manufacturers (cil,
andover, ma, usa; dow chemical, midland, mi,
usa; ss. zlotsky, ufa oil institute, russia), determined for concentration by gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry and prepared using appropriate safety
precautions as previously described [27]. all-transretinoic acid,  xxxd3105xxx , all-trans-retinal, alltrans-retinyl palmitate, and bovine  xxxg124xxx 
(bsa; retinoid free) were purchased from sigma
(deisenhofen, germany). retinyl esters other than
retinyl palmitate were synthesized [31,32]. all solvents
used throughout the work were at least of hplc grade
and obtained from merck (darmstadt, germany) or
mallinckrodt baker (greisheim, germany). all other
chemicals were of analytical grade and commercially
purchased. all laboratory manipulations involving the
retinoids were performed in dark rooms under dim yellow light to prevent degradation of retinoids by uv
light.
2.2. animals and study design
all animal experimentation was approved by the
local ethical committees on animal experiments. the
mice were of a mixed c57bl/6 and 129/sv origin.
wildtype (wt) mice of the same genetic background
were chosen as controls. all mice were housed on
hardwood chip bedding in a controlled environment
(20–21 ◦ c, 50% humidity, 12 h light, 12 h dark) and
were tested for genotype by pcr in the breeding process essentially as previously described [12]. the viability and general phenotypes of all mutants used in
this study except the ci/cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− line, have been
reported elsewhere [5,12,18].
2.2.1. experiment 1
male and female rar␤2−/− [8], rar␥2−/− and
cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− mice [17,18], and their corresponding
wt had free access to a diet stated to contain 12,000 iu
 xxxd3105xxx /kg (r34; lactamin, stockholm, sweden),
and tap water. all mice were weaned from the dams
at 3 weeks of age. the dams were also fed the r34
diet. at 2, 4, or 8 weeks of age, the mice were
anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (mebumal® ),
90 mg/kg bw i.p., and sacrificed by withdrawal of the
blood from the heart. livers, kidneys, thymus, lungs,

28

p. hoegberg et al. / chemico-biological interactions 156 (2005) 25–39

and testes were excised, weighed, and frozen in liquid
nitrogen.
2.2.2. experiment 2
to study retinoid processing in mice following
chemical stress, we investigated adult mutant mice 4
weeks after a single i.p. dose of vehicle or tcdd.
mice lacking rar␣ [7], rar␤ [33], rar␥ [6], rxr␤
[34] or rxr␥ [35] (all isoforms) were used. as the
rxr␣ null mutation is lethal in utero [36], we used
heterozygous mice (rxr␣+/− ). the male mutant mice
and their corresponding wt, 6–14 weeks of age, had
free access to standard rat/mouse/hamster chow (hope
farms, woerden, the netherlands), stated to contain
approximately 17,000 iu retinol exclusive of the contribution from ␤-carotene, and tap water. on day 0
of the experiment, all mice were given an i.p. injection with 50 ␮g tcdd/kg body weight in corn oil or
corn oil alone (10 ml/kg). on day 28 of the experiment, the mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane/n2
and sacrificed by collecting the blood by orbital puncture in heparinized tubes. liver and thymus were
removed, weighed and frozen on dry ice, and stored
at −80 ◦ c.
2.2.3. experiment 3
after weaning and throughout the experiment, male
cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− mice and ci/cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− mice and
their corresponding wt had free access to rat and
mouse no. 1 maintenance diet (sds, stockholm, sweden), stated to contain 6300 iu  xxxd3105xxx /kg, and tap
water. at 8 weeks ± 1 day of age, mice were given a
single oral dose of 50 ␮g tcdd/kg bw in a vehicle of
corn oil (10 ml/kg bw), or vehicle only (controls). following anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital, 90 mg/kg
bw i.p., the blood was withdrawn from the heart. liver
and thymus were excised, weighed, frozen in n2 , and
stored at −70 ◦ c.
2.3. retinoid analyses
retinoids in liver were analyzed according to
schmidt et al. [37]. briefly, retinoids were extracted
from aqueous tissue homogenates by a single liquid
extraction with isopropanol. polar and  xxxd1850xxx  retinoids
were separated via solid-phase extraction using an
aminopropyl column. after vacuum concentration to
complete dryness and re-dilution in appropriate sol-

vents, the prepared samples were injected onto two
different gradient hplc systems. polar retinoids (alltrans- xxxd3417xxx , 9-cis-4-oxo-13,14-dihydro-retinoic
acid) were analyzed on a narrow-bore rp18 column
(2.1 id) with uv detection at 340 nm using a binary
gradient composed of methanol and water. recoveries
were in the range of 85–95%. the mass limit of detection for  xxxd3417xxx  was 30 pg; the overall
detection limit was 0.4 ng/g tissue.  xxxd1850xxx  retinoids
(retinyl palmitate,  xxxd2777xxx , linoleate and stearate; alltrans-retinol) were separated using a ternary gradient
composed of acetonitrile, chloroform, and methanol on
a normal-bore rp18 column (4.6 id) with uv detection at 325 nm. the mass limit of quantification was
about 600 pg  xxxd3105xxx  at a signal-to-noise ratio
of 5:1 and the overall limit of quantification 8 ng/g tissue. the intra- and inter-assay error was in general less
than 8%.
2.4. cytochrome p4501a activity
analysis of hepatic cytochrome p4501a activity
was done by measuring ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase
(erod) activity essentially according to the method
by burke [38–40]. the formation of resorufin from
ethoxyresorufin (erod activity) was measured either
in microsomal fractions prepared as in [41], in a 96well format and using a fluorospectrophotometric plate
reader (ex. 530 nm, em. 590 nm; experiment 2), or in
liver homogenates (20% in 0.2 m sucrose) with a shimadzu rf-5000 spectrofluorometer (ex. 522 nm, em.
586 nm; experiment 3).
2.5. statistical analyses
each study was evaluated separately. statistical
analyses were performed using spss statistical software (spss inc. chicago, il, usa). all values are
expressed as the arithmetic mean ± s.d. for each individual group of animals. group sizes are as indicated in tables and figures. overall effects and interactions were analyzed on normally distributed data
(kolmogorov–smirnov or shapiro–wilk test, depending on group sizes) by two- or three-way analysis of variance (anova), using the general linear model univariate procedure. genotype, treatment,
time, and/or gender were fixed factors. endpoints
showing significance in the overall f test were tested

p. hoegberg et al. / chemico-biological interactions 156 (2005) 25–39

further for treatment-related (50 ␮g/kg versus 0 ␮g/kg)
and genotype-related (mutant versus wt) differences
using the independent samples t test. for data with nonhomogenous variances, the separate-variance t test was
used. for not normally distributed data, the t test was
replaced by the mann–whitney test.

29

gender-related trends could be observed. liver levels of
9-cis-4-oxo-13,14-dihydro- xxxd3417xxx  ranged from
about 10 to 30 ng/g, tended to decrease after the 2 week
time point in female cai/ii−/− and rar␤2−/− mice
and were in general 3–6 times higher than all-transretinoic acid levels.
3.2. experiment 2

3. results
3.1. experiment 1
at two weeks of age rar␤2−/− males weighed
more than wt, but there was no difference after
weaning (table 1). at 2 and 8 weeks of age, female
cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− mice displayed lower body weights than
wt females. body weights of the other mutant mice
were indistinguishable from wt. no differences in relative liver weights (g/kg body weight) between mutants
and wt were observed, except for a lower relative
liver weight in rar␤2−/− and cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− females
at 8 weeks of age. rar␤2−/− mice of both sexes
had lower relative kidney weights than wt mice (not
significant in females at 8 weeks). two-week female
and 8-week male crabp i/ii−/− mice also displayed
slightly lower relative kidney weights than wt mice,
but there was not the same clear trend as in the
rar␤2−/− mice. relative lung and testis weights were
generally similar in all genotypes. relative thymus
weights decreased from 2 to 8 weeks of age and there
were no consistent divergences in any of the mutant
lines.
the concentration of the hepatic “sum of retinoids”
(consisting mainly of retinyl esters and retinol)
increased approximately four-fold from 2 to 8 weeks
of age in most mice, indicating a normal build-up of
 xxxd3105xxx  stores (table 2). although rar␤2−/− and
cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− females showed higher retinoid concentration than wt mice at 8 weeks of age, these differences were not as pronounced when expressed as total
amount of  xxxd3105xxx  in the liver (i.e. ␮g/liver; data not
shown). retinyl palmitate, retinyl linoleate, and retinol
accounted for the difference in the “sum of retinoids”
in these two mutants (table 2 and data not shown).
retinol levels in liver remained relatively constant
over time (about 2–4 ␮g/g).  xxxd3417xxx  levels remained relatively constant over time and were
roughly the same in mice of all genotypes. no clear

the body weights of the adult mutant mice did not
differ from their corresponding wt, either at the start
of experiment (data not shown) or in control animals
four weeks after the start of the experiment (table 3
). relative liver weights were lower in rar␤−/− and
rxr␥−/− mice compared to wt mice. relative thymus weights in unexposed mutant mice did not differ
from wt. endogenous erod activity was low and
similar in all mice. the “sum of retinoids” in liver, ranging from 3 ␮mol/g to almost 5 ␮mol/g or 4–7 ␮mol in
total, was high and reflected the higher age and dietary
 xxxd3105xxx  intake of the animals in this experiment
compared to experiments 1 and 3. the liver concentration of “sum of retinoids” was approximately 40%
higher in rar␤−/− and rxr␥−/− mice compared to
wt. the difference could mainly be accounted for by
retinyl esters. despite the different  xxxd3105xxx  content
of the diet compared to experiment 1, hepatic all-transretinoic acid levels were generally in the same range
as in experiment 1 (approx. 3–10 ng/g). the observed
statistically significant difference by genotype in hepatic  xxxd3417xxx  concentrations could mainly
be accounted for by rxr␤−/− , where concentrations
were about 3.5 times higher than that of wt. no statistically significant differences in hepatic 9-cis-4-oxo13,14-dihydro- xxxd3417xxx  concentrations could be
observed between the individual mutant lines and their
corresponding wt, although rxr␤−/− livers showed a
50% higher concentration of this  xxxd3417xxx  metabolite.
the selected dose of tcdd did not affect the body
weights of the animals during the 4-week study. however, slightly increased relative liver weight, statistically significant in rar␣−/− and rxr␥−/− mice
(about 25% increased), was observed in all groups
exposed to tcdd. no statistically significant changes
in relative thymus weights could be associated with
the exposure. erod activity was significantly induced
by tcdd; an approximately 20–40-fold increase was

other mutants, levels of 9-cis-4-oxo-13,14-dihydroretinoic acid remained approximately two-fold higher
than wt in rxr␤−/− mice following tcdd exposure.
3.3. experiment 3
although there was a trend towards lower body
weights in the cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− binding protein knockout mice compared to wt mice, no individual group
differed significantly from wt controls (table 4). relative liver, kidney, and thymus weights were independent of genotype (data not shown). wt mice almost
doubled their total hepatic  xxxd3105xxx  concentrations
between 9 and 12 weeks of age (i.e. 7 and 28 days
after exposure to vehicle, table 4). the hepatic concentration of  xxxd3105xxx  (the sum of retinyl esters and
retinol) in ci/cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− mice was about one half of
that of wt mice at both time points (340 nmol/g versus 650 nmol/g and 460 nmol/g versus 1130 nmol/g).
all measured individual retinyl ester forms (retinyl
palmitate, stearate, linoleate, and  xxxd2777xxx ) were significantly lower in the ci/cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− mice (data not
shown). hepatic retinyl ester levels in cai/ xxxg293xxx −/−
mice, on the other hand, were not significantly different from wt at any time point. hepatic retinol
levels were constant over time and were low in the
retinoid binding protein knockout mice compared to
wt mice. the lowest concentrations of retinol were

found in mice with the ci/cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− genotype at
9 and 12 weeks of age (about 40–50% of wt levels).  xxxd3417xxx  levels were also fairly
constant over time and significantly lower in livers
of ci/cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− mice at 3 months. in contrast,
hepatic 9-cis-4-oxo-13,14-dihydro- xxxd3417xxx  levels
were higher in ci/cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− mice than in the wt.
the cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− mice did not differ from wt in either
of the two quantified  xxxd3417xxx  forms.
tcdd exposure did not affect the body weights of
the animals during the 4-week study, but caused the
expected increases in relative liver weights (10–30%)
and decreases in relative thymus weights (30–60%) in
all mice (data not shown). erod activity was induced
30–40-fold by tcdd one week after exposure in
wt and cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− livers, and almost 60-fold in
ci/cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− livers (fig. 1). all mice decreased
their hepatic retinyl ester concentrations upon exposure to tcdd, but “sum retinoids” were almost entirely
depleted in ci/cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− mice whereas wt mice
retained approximately 60% of their hepatic vitamin
a compared to control at 28 days. thus, 28 days
after exposure, a 90% decrease of total  xxxd3105xxx 
(retinyl esters and retinol) concentration was observed
in ci/cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− livers, compared to approximately
30–40% in wt and cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− livers. calculated as
total retinoid levels in the liver, the ci/cai/ xxxg293xxx −/−
mice had lost 50% 7 days after exposure and 90%
28 days after treatment, compared to 25–30% in the

we have investigated hepatic levels of endogenous
retinoids as well as the tcdd-responsiveness of mice
lacking retinoid receptors or binding proteins to inves-

tigate the role of these genes in normal and disrupted
retinoid homeostasis. the role of the retinoid receptors
in retinoid processing and signaling under normal conditions has been rather well characterized previously
[3]. in accordance with these previous data we observed
essentially normal body growth and similar hepatic
retinoid accumulation in 2-, 4- and 8-week-old receptor null mutants (table 1). however, we found lower
kidney weights in both male and female rar␤2−/−
mice. to our knowledge, this has not been reported
previously in juvenile or adult rar␤2−/− mice. in a
published study examining rar␣1/rar␤2−/− mice
and rar␣/rar␤2−/− mice, the authors described
bilateral renal hypoplasia at embryonic day 18.5 [42].
our results suggest that rar␤2 may, on its own,
have a role in kidney physiology also in postnatal
life.
contrary to retinoid receptor knockout mice, adult
retinoid binding protein knockout mice have been less
well studied previously. in ci/cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− mice, we
observed hepatic retinyl ester, retinol and all-transretinoic acid concentrations less than half of those in
the wt mice, and about two-fold elevated 9-cis-4-oxo13,14-dihydro- xxxd3417xxx  concentrations (table 4).
as the cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− mice did not exhibit this abnormal retinoid profile, this observation suggests that the
absence of  xxxg1938xxx  i may lead to abnormal levels of
trans- and cis-retinoids in the liver.

35

to explore whether some of the adverse actions of
dioxins might be exerted via altered retinoid action,
we stressed the mice chemically with a single dose of
tcdd. the investigated hypothesis was that without a
full set of retinoid receptors or binding proteins, tcdd
might not fully exert its disruptive effect on the retinoid
system. alternatively, a lack of retinoid receptors or
retinoid binding protein might lead to increased susceptibility to environmental insult and thereby explain
some of the evolutionary pressure to conserve these
proteins. after tcdd exposure, the loss of hepatic
retinyl ester stores in wt and cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− mice was
approximately 25–50% on a concentration basis, and
25–30% on total levels basis. receptor knockouts and
their wt controls lost approximately the same amount
(10–40% based on concentrations as well as total levels) except the rxr␤−/− mice, which did not lose any
retinoids upon exposure (table 3). the rxr␤ null mice
are the first animals we know of that have not shown
reduced liver retinyl ester stores after dioxin exposure.
possibly, a mechanism involved in the regulation of
retinoid storage does not function in the rxr␤−/−
mouse. the signal that regulates retinoid storage is not
known, but it is likely that some molecule in the oxidative pathway of retinoids informs the liver about the
 xxxd3105xxx  status of extrahepatic cells. hepatic stellate
cells, the cells that store  xxxd3105xxx , clearly express
rxr␤ [43], but the role of this gene in hepatic stellate
cells has not been studied in detail. regardless, further
studies using larger group sizes are needed to investigate the role of rxr␤ more conclusively. in contrast
to the rxr␤−/− mice, hepatic retinyl ester levels were
almost entirely depleted in ci/cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− mice 28
days after tcdd exposure (table 4). the loss of liver
“sum retinoids” concentrations was on average of the
two time points 80% in the triple binding protein knockout mice and 40% in wt mice (in total levels a 70 and
25% loss in triple knockout and wt mice, respectively;
data not shown).
we noted that the differences in the  xxxd3105xxx  content of the diets used in the various experiments in
this study were reflected in substantial differences in
both retinyl ester (i.e. retinyl palmitate) and retinol levels in the liver (50–2000 and 1–70 ␮g/g, respectively;
tables 2–4). however, the levels of all-trans-retinoic
acid were similar (3–10 ng/g). tcdd did not alter
the hepatic  xxxd3417xxx  levels in the mouse,
consistent with previous results in mice exposed to

36

p. hoegberg et al. / chemico-biological interactions 156 (2005) 25–39

tcdd (unpublished data) and the  xxxg575xxx  inducer
3-methylcholanthrene [44]. this result, is however, in
contrast to rats, which displayed a dose-related increase
in  xxxd3417xxx  levels from 24 h and as long
as 28 days after a single dose of tcdd [27]. the difference in  xxxd3417xxx  levels in rats and mice
after dioxin exposure may be due to different substrate
specificities of – currently unknown – dioxin-induced
enzymes with activity towards retinoids. it has previously been suggested that a massive  xxxg575xxx  induction
might result in an induced  xxxd3417xxx  synthesis in
the rat [27,45]. in humans, some evidence points to
 xxxg575xxx  as being involved in retinal oxidation/retinoic
acid synthesis [46], while other evidence implies that it
is involved in  xxxd3417xxx  oxidation both in vitro and
in vivo [47].
contrary to the species-related difference in alltrans- xxxd3417xxx  levels after dioxin exposure, hepatic 9-cis-4-oxo-13,14-dihydro- xxxd3417xxx  levels
were similarly affected by tcdd in wt mice
(tables 3 and 4) and rats [48]. in the rat, 9-cis-4oxo-13,14-dihydro- xxxd3417xxx  levels were decreased
already 24 h after the oral dose and were undetectable
from days 3 through 28 [48]. moreover, the levels
were significantly reduced by single doses of tcdd
as low as 0.1 ␮g/kg body weight. hepatic levels of
9-cis-4-oxo-13,14-dihydro- xxxd3417xxx  seem to correlate with  xxxd3105xxx  intake or status, as they vary
from 11 ng/g liver in mice fed standard laboratory
mouse chow containing 15,000 iu  xxxd3105xxx /kg diet,
to over 100 ng/g in mice supplemented with 150,000 iu
[32]. some evidence suggests that 9-cis-4-oxo-13,14dihydro- xxxd3417xxx  may be a metabolite of 9-cisretinoic acid; feeding rats with high oral doses of
9- xxxd2404xxx  results in an increase in the similar 9-cis-13,14-dihydro- xxxd3417xxx  in serum and
liver [49]. this metabolite has been proposed to be
a substrate of the same metabolic pathway as that of
phytanic acid, which is an rxr ligand structurally
very similar to 9- xxxd2404xxx  [50]. in the present
study, rxr␤ null mice had 1.5-fold higher 9-cis-4oxo-13,14-dihydro- xxxd3417xxx  levels and three-fold
higher  xxxd3417xxx  levels compared to wt
mice (table 3). the rxr␤ protein is ubiquitously
expressed in the body [51] and its absence could
critically alter the expression of genes that are regulated by this receptor. rxrs heterodimerize with other
nuclear receptors, thereby controlling a plethora of

genes. an insufficient number of rxr␤ receptors may
have several adverse effects, e.g. in the cns [52,53].
rar␤/rxr␤−/− as well as rxr␤/rxr␥−/− double
null mice develop parkinson-like symptoms [54,55].
the interference by dioxins with insulin action has been
suggested to involve inhibition of the ppar/rxr signaling pathway [56]. interesting to note in the present
context is that patients suffering from type 2 diabetes
have an impaired capacity to metabolize  xxxd3105xxx 
[57]. knowing also that the rxr␤ null mice did not
lose any hepatic retinyl ester stores upon tcdd exposure, the rxr␤ gene certainly deserves further studies
in relation to the regulation of  xxxd3105xxx  levels and
storage.
the rare in the  xxxg575xxx  gene has been shown
to be activated by rar␣ and tr␣ (but not by rar␥)
in an in vitro system [58]. this suggests that  xxxg575xxx 
is positively regulated by retinoids via rar␣. more
recent in vivo and in vitro studies, however, imply that
the  xxxg575xxx  rare is inhibitory and that endogenous
retinoids may negatively modulate  xxxg575xxx  induction
by xenobiotics [59–63]. our observation that erod
activity, a marker for  xxxg575xxx  levels and activity,
was significantly higher in the rar␣ null mice than
in wt (table 3) may be due to a loss of attenuation of hepatic  xxxg575xxx  induction in the absence of
rar␣. deficiency of the ligand for rar␣, i.e. alltrans- xxxd3417xxx , would then be expected to result
in the same loss of attenuation of erod induction.
indeed, a higher erod induction by tcdd compared
to wt was observed in ci/cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− mouse liver
(fig. 1). however, despite the coinciding trends in
rar␣−/− and ci/cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− mice, we cannot rule
out the possibility that the erod response has different efficacies or different time courses in these animals
compared to their respective wt controls.
in summary, mice lacking one isotype of retinoid
receptors rar␣, ␤, and ␥, and rxr␣ and ␥, showed
relatively small alterations to retinoid processing, irrespective of exposure to tcdd. the lack of alterations
in tissue retinoid levels in these mutants is likely to
be attributed to the functional redundancy that exists
among these receptors [5]. our observation that mice
lacking rxr␤ did not lose any retinoids at all upon
tcdd treatment suggests a role of rxr␤ in retinoid
storage regulation and warrants further study. importantly, the present study also implies that  xxxg1938xxx  i
is required for the maintenance of  xxxd3105xxx  lev-

p. hoegberg et al. / chemico-biological interactions 156 (2005) 25–39

els including  xxxd3417xxx , and that the absence of
 xxxg1938xxx  i results in a higher susceptibility to chemical insult by dioxin. these conclusions are mainly
based on the findings that: (i) mice lacking  xxxg1938xxx 
i, crabp i, and crabp ii had significantly lower
retinyl ester, retinol, and  xxxd3417xxx  concentrations
in the liver than wt mice whereas their 9-cis-4-oxo13,14-dihydro- xxxd3417xxx  levels were elevated, (ii)
these mice were almost entirely depleted for hepatic
retinyl esters following tcdd exposure whereas wt
and crabp double knockout mice retained significant hepatic retinoid stores after tcdd treatment,
and (iii) the absence of the crabps alone did not
affect normal or tcdd-challenged  xxxd3417xxx  homeostasis considerably. we are now investigating the
single  xxxg1938xxx  i knockout mice more extensively. preliminary results support the indications in the present
study that this gene plays a critical role in the maintenance of hepatic and serum  xxxd3105xxx  levels both
under normal conditions and those of dioxin-induced
stress.
a complicating factor in this study was that the
mutants and wts used in these experiments were of the
strains 129/sv and c57bl/6, mixed in various ratios.
although they were crossed in a similar manner along
the breeding procedure, thereby staying the same ratio,
the genetic backgrounds cannot be regarded as absolutely identical. the rather large intra and inter-group
variability in the tcdd experiments, in particular with
respect to thymic atrophy (experiments 2 and 3) may
contribute to this result; the c57bl/6 strain carries an
 xxxg105xxx  (ahr) which is more responsive to tcdd than that of the 129/sv strain. on the
other hand, wt and mutants had the same variety of
ahr background. furthermore, the doses employed in
this study were sufficient to induce erod activity in
all mutant strains and controls, and with the exception of the ci/cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− strain the inductions were
generally in the order of 20–40-fold. in addition, previous investigation of altered retinoid status in c57bl/6
mice and dba/2 mice did not reveal marked interstrain
differences following tcdd exposure [64], in agreement with the assertion that the notable differences in
retinoid metabolism observed herein were related to
the retinoid receptors and retinoid binding proteins of
interest and not an artifact of the ahr genotype.
therefore, this study has shown that all-transretinoic acid homeostasis in the mouse is tightly reg-

37

ulated despite vast differences in  xxxd3105xxx  intake
and exposure to the retinoid-disruptor tcdd. thus,
we suggest that  xxxd3417xxx  levels only
slightly below normal, such as those seen in the
ci/cai/ xxxg293xxx −/− mice in this study, could influence
genes regulated by  xxxd3417xxx . despite the fact that
the retinoid system is highly regulated, the use of transgenic mice in the present study has enabled us to
suggest that the loss or impairment of the function of
cellular retinol-binding  xxxg165xxx  increases the susceptibility to tcdd-induced retinoid depletion.
