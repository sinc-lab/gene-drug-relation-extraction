abstract
treatment of intact human platelets with the
adenylate cyclase agonist  xxxd1742xxx  (100 jbm) resulted in an
increase in camp phosphodiesterase activity in freeze-thaw
lysates. when the low-km (high affinity), cgmp-inhibited
camp phosphodiesterase was isolated from such lysates by blue
dextran-sepharose chromatography, the specific activity of the
enzyme was increased an average of 11-fold over similarly
processed control platelets. the increase in the low-k., cgmpinhibited camp phosphodiesterase activity was inhibited when
platelets were incubated with the protein kinase inhibitor  xxxd736xxx 
prior to treatment with  xxxd1742xxx , suggesting that the stimulation of camp phosphodiesterase activity involved a campdependent phosphorylation. when intact platelets that had
been prelabeled with 32p; were treated with  xxxd1742xxx  and the
low-k., cgmp-inhibited phosphodiesterase was isolated by
blue dextran-sepharose chromatography, a protein of 110,000
kda was phosphorylated. by using a monospecific antiserum to
the purified phosphodiesterase, this protein was shown to be
the low-k., cgmp-inhibited camp phosphodiesterase by electrophoretic transfer blot (western blot) analysis and by immunoprecipitation. the stable prostacyclin analog  xxxd2331xxx  also
stimulated the low-km camp phosphodiesterase activity about
2-fold and caused phosphorylation of the enzyme. these results
suggest that phosphorylation of the low-k., cgmp-inhibited
phosphodiesterase may be an important regulatory mechanism
for this enzyme in platelets.

an increased intracellular level of camp is associated with
inhibition of platelet responses to agonists, including such
responses as shape change, aggregation, adhesion, and granule release (1-3). thus the regulation of the enzymes involved
in camp formation and degradation strongly influences the
participation of platelets in physiological hemostasis and
pathological thrombosis. the control of adenylate cyclase
which catalyzes the conversion of atp to camp has been
studied in considerable detail (4). much less is known about
the regulation of camp catabolism.
the hydrolysis of the intracellular messengers camp and
cgmp is carried out by several different cyclic nucleotide
phosphodiesterases. these enzymes differ in their substrate
specificities, kinetic characteristics, physical properties, and
regulation (5-7). most cells contain several of these forms of
 xxxg1696xxx  but the role of each of
these multiple species of phosphodiesterase in cells is still
unclear.
human platelets have been reported to contain three
different forms of  xxxg1696xxx  activity (8). the first is relatively specific for cgmp, the second
is a cgmp-stimulated phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes

in accordance with 18 u.s.c. §1734 solely to indicate this fact.

camp and cgmp equally well, and the third displays a low
km (high affinity) for camp but hydrolyzes cgmp poorly.
we have previously reported a purification of this third form
of phosphodiesterase from human platelets (9). the purified
enzyme had a low km (high affinity) for camp and was
inhibited competitively by cgmp. kinetically similar forms
of phosphodiesterase activity have been described in a
number of cell types (10-13).
several mechanisms exist for the control of the activities of
the various forms of phosphodiesterase in cells. certain
cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases are sensitive to activation by ca2+/calmodulin, some are sensitive to stimulation
by cgmp, and others appear to be hormonally modulated (57). in this paper we report that incubation of intact human
platelets with the plant diterpene  xxxd1742xxx  or  xxxd2331xxx  (zk
36374), a stable analog of the naturally occurring potent
prostaglandin 12 (prostacyclin), results in stimulation of the
activity of the low-km (high affinity) camp phosphodiesterase and phosphorylation of the phosphodiesterase molecule.
since both agents lead to a rise in platelet camp by stimulating adenylate cyclase by different mechanisms, these
results provide at least a partial explanation for the apparent
desensitization after exposure to these agonists. a preliminary account of this work has been presented (14).

materials and methods
determination of camp phosphodiesterase activity. phosphodiesterase activity was determined as described using the
dowex column procedure described by thompson et al. (15)
or the baso4 procedure of sinha et al. (16). all assays were
done at 1 um camp unless noted.
preparation of antiserum. low-km camp phosphodiesterase was purified from outdated platelet concentrates as
described (9). after an initial bleeding to obtain preimmune
serum, a young nulliparous female rabbit was inoculated with
100-150 mg of the purified phosphodiesterase in complete
freund's adjuvant using multiple intradermal injections as
described by vaitukaitis (17). after 10 weeks the rabbit was
given booster injections with =50 mg of low-km camp
phosphodiesterase in complete freund's adjuvant. two
weeks after reimmunization blood was drawn from the
central ear artery, placed in glass tubes without anticoagulants, incubated at 370c for 1.5 hr, and then stored overnight
at 40c. the serum removed from the clot was heated at 560c
for 0.5 hr and stored at -700c.
neutralization of camp phosphodiesterase activity by antiserum. the purified phosphodiesterase was diluted in 125
mm tris-hcl (ph 7.5) containing 20 mm mgci2 and 1 mg of
bovine  xxxg124xxx  per ml. appropriate dilutions of the

antiserum were added to the enzyme, incubated for 3.5 hr at
250c, and assayed for camp phosphodiesterase activity.
elisa of antiserum with purified camp phosphodiesterases. elisa measurements were performed as described by
engvall and perlmann (18). elisa cuvettes (gilford) were
coated with purified phosphodiesterases, blocked with 1%
bovine  xxxg124xxx , and incubated with a 1:500 dilution of
the antiserum. after washing the cuvettes, immune complex
formation was detected with a goat anti-rabbit igg-alkaline
phosphatase conjugate (sigma) using  xxxd2822xxx  as the substrate.
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page) and immunoblotting. nadodso4-containing polyacrylamide gels were
run as described by laemmli (19). gels were blotted to
nitrocellulose as described by towbin et al. (20), blocked
with bovine  xxxg124xxx  or casein, incubated with a 1:500
dilution of antiserum overnight at 4tc, washed, and incubated
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit igg
antibody (bio-rad). the bands were then visualized by
reaction of 4-chloro-1-naphthol and h202 (21).
 xxxd1742xxx  and  xxxd2331xxx  treatment of platelets and isolation
of low-km camp phosphodiesterase. platelet-rich plasma was
prepared from freshly drawn blood anticoagulated with acid
citrate dextrose and separated from red blood cells by
centrifugation at 120 x g for 30 min. the ph of the plasma
was adjusted to 6.5 with  xxxd1710xxx  and the platelets were
pelleted by centrifugation at 1100 x g for 20 min. the platelet
pellet was resuspended at a concentration of 1010 platelets per
ml in 50 mm tris hcl (ph 7.5) containing 20 mm mgcl2, 0.15
m nacl, 10 mm  xxxd302xxx , 2 mm egta, 5 mm
 xxxd146xxx , 20,m 7-amino-1-chloro-3-tosylamido2-heptanone, 5 ,m pepstatin a, and 40 ,m leupeptin (buffer
a).  xxxd1742xxx  (10 mm in 95% ethanol) or  xxxd2331xxx  (in water)
was added to 1-ml samples (1010 platelets) to give a final
concentration of 50 or 100 ,m  xxxd1742xxx  or 0.1 am  xxxd2331xxx .
the sample was incubated at 30°c for 5-10 min with  xxxd1742xxx 
or for 4 min with  xxxd2331xxx . an equal volume of buffer a
without mgci2 but containing 10 mm naf and 20 mm sodium
pyrophosphate was then added and the sample was mixed
briefly and frozen in a dry ice bath. the sample was thawed
and centrifuged for 2 min at 12,000 x g at 4°c and the
supernatant was applied to a 1-ml blue dextran-sepharose
column previously equilibrated with buffer a. after the
sample was added the column was washed with at least 5 ml
of buffer a and then the phosphodiesterase was eluted with
0.3 mm camp in buffer a. the column fractions were
assayed for camp phosphodiesterase activity at 1 ,um camp
as described (9) and fractions containing phosphodiesterase
activity were pooled and stored at 0-4°c.
samples to be analyzed on page were lyophilized and then
resuspended in the sample buffer for nadodso4 gels (19),
heated at 100°c for 2-3 min, cooled, and applied to the gel.
32p labeling of platelets. the platelet pellet was resuspended in 10 mm hepes (ph 6.6) containing 1 mm mgcl2,
0.145 m nacl, 5 mm kcl, 20 mm glucose, 0.5 unit of hirudin
per ml, and 10 ,um d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone at a concentration of 5 x 109 platelets per ml.
carrier-free 32p04 was added at 0.25 mci/ml (1 ci = 37 gbq)
and the suspension was incubated at 37°c for 1 hr with
occasional mixing. the platelet suspension was centrifuged
at 1100 x g for 20 min, and the platelet pellet was resuspended
in buffer a at 1010 platelets per ml and incubated with
 xxxd1742xxx  or  xxxd2331xxx  as described above.
gels and nitrocellulose blots of 32p-labeled samples were
analyzed for 32p labeling by autoradiography.
immunoisolation of low-km camp phosphodiesterase from
platelet lysate. immunoprecipitation using anti-low-km
camp phosphodiesterase antiserum was performed by using
heat-inactivated, formalin-fixed staphylococcus aureus (cowen
i) cells (pansorbin, calbiochem) as described by kessler (22).

platelets preincubated with 32po4 were treated with  xxxd1742xxx 
and lysed as described above, and cellular debris was
removed by centrifugation (12,000 x g, 10 min). one-fifth
volume of a 10% suspension of bovine serum albuminwashed s. aureus cells was added to the lysate and incubated
for 2 hr at 4tc with gentle mixing. this preincubation was
done to reduce nonspecific binding to the s. aureus cells.
after removal of the s. aureus cells, antiserum was added to
the lysate (1:50 dilution) and incubated overnight at 40c.
one-fourth volume of a 10% suspension of bovine serum
albumin-washed s. aureus cells was then added to the lysate
and incubated for 4 hr at 4tc. the cells were isolated by
centrifugation, washed, resuspended in the sample buffer for
nadodso4 gels (19), and prepared for electrophoresis.

results and discussion
characteristics of a monospecific polyclonal antiserum to
low-km (high affinity) camp phosphodiesterase. our approach was to demonstrate that phosphorylation occurred in
intact platelets as a response to elevated intracellular levels
of camp. to achieve this we first prepared a monospecific
polyclonal antiserum against the low-km camp phosphodiesterase from human platelets in rabbits. when the antiserum was employed in an immunoblot analysis of a whole
platelet lysate, bands were observed at 110 kda and 75 kda
(fig. 1, lane 1). when the immunoblot of the lysate was
probed with the corresponding preimmune serum the band at
75 kda was stained (fig. 1, lane 2). thus an antibody to this
unknown protein was present in the rabbit prior to immunization and is thus irrelevant. the band seen at 110 kda is the
expected monomer molecular mass of the low-km camp
phosphodiesterase in agreement with the results of beavo
and co-workers (11, 23).
when the platelet lysate was passed over a blue dextransepharose column and the phosphodiesterase was eluted
with camp (see materials and methods), only a single band
at 110 kda was observed on an immunoblot of the proteins
separated by nadodso4/page (fig. 1, lane 3). the 75-kda
protein did not bind to the blue dextran-sepharose column
and was recovered in the wash-through fraction (data not
shown).

further evidence that the antiserum recognized the low-km
camp phosphodiesterase was derived from experiments
indicating that the antiserum neutralized the enzymatic
activity >90%, whereas the preimmune serum did not inhibit
the enzyme (data not shown). the binding of the antiserum
was proportional to the concentration of the antigen, purified
low-km camp phosphodiesterase, as detected in an elisa
(fig. 2). in contrast, no reaction was observed when a
purified cgmp-stimulated phosphodiesterase from human
platelets (24) was used as the primary antigen (fig. 2). these
results indicate that these two camp phosphodiesterase
activities found in human platelets are immunologically distinct proteins.
the immunoblot results indicate that the monomer molecular mass of the low-km camp phosphodiesterase from
human platelets is 110 kda. however, we have previously
reported a monomer molecular mass of 61 kda for the low-km
camp phosphodiesterase purified from platelets derived
from outdated platelet concentrates (9). subsequently, harrison et al. (11) reported the purification of a camp phosphodiesterase from bovine cardiac muscle with properties
similar to the platelet enzyme but with a monomer molecular
mass of 110 kda. when antibodies raised against this bovine
phosphodiesterase were used to probe immunoblots of human and bovine platelet lysates, single reactive bands at 100
kda were observed in both lysates (23). however, when the
bovine platelet lysate was incubated at room temperature for
3-6 hr prior to gel analysis, the phosphodiesterase appeared
to undergo sequential proteolysis to 80-kda and then 60-kda
peptides (23). the evidence from the studies of the bovine
cardiac enzyme as well as the results described above with
the antiserum against the purified human platelet phosphodiesterase indicate that the 61-kda form of the low-km camp
phosphodiesterase that we purified from outdated platelet
concentrates was a proteolytic fragment of the enzyme.
when the antiserum against the 61-kda form was used to
probe an immunoblot of a lysate prepared from platelets
isolated from outdated platelet concentrates, the major band
was at 110 kda with a weakly staining band at 60 kda (data
not shown), suggesting that most of the proteolysis occurred
during the course of the purification in spite of the presence
of a mixture of protease inhibitors in all buffers (9).

ulate camp phosphodiesterase activity in platelet lysates
(25-27). treatment of rat platelets with the plant diterpene
 xxxd1742xxx , which directly stimulates the catalytic subunit of
adenylate cyclase, increased camp and cgmp phosphodiesterase activities (28). the enhanced activity was maintained through partial purification of these enzymes, suggesting that the stimulation was due to covalent modification of
the enzyme (26-28). although these authors postulated that
this stimulation was due to an intermediate phosphorylation
by a camp-dependent protein kinase (26-28), no direct
evidence of phosphorylation of the phosphodiesterases was
demonstrated.
to test this hypothesis we incubated intact human platelets
with 50-100 p.m  xxxd1742xxx  for 5-10 min at 30'c and disrupted
the cells by freezing and thawing. this concentration of
 xxxd1742xxx  is known to elevate camp about 30-fold by direct
stimulation of the catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase (29).
treatment of human platelets with  xxxd1742xxx  resulted in a 3to 4-fold increase in camp phosphodiesterase activity in the
platelet lysates measured with 1 a.m camp. to determine
which of the two forms of camp phosphodiesterase activity
present in human platelets (9) was affected, we separated the
phosphodiesterases by blue dextran-sepharose chromatography. under the conditions used, the low-km camp phosphodiesterase bound to the blue dextran column and was
eluted with camp. in contrast, the cgmp-stimulated phosphodiesterase passed through the column without binding,
allowing a rapid separation of these two camp phosphodiesterase activities. when the phosphodiesterases were
separated, the specific activity of the low-km camp phosphodiesterase from the  xxxd1742xxx -treated cells was stimulated
11.3-fold (+3.8-fold) over that from control platelets. the
degree of stimulation varied with platelet preparations from
about 3- to 13-fold. addition of  xxxd1742xxx  directly to platelet
lysates and to assays of the blue dextran-sepharose-purified
enzyme resulted in no change in camp phosphodiesterase
activity (data not shown).
involvement of camp-dependent protein kinase in the
stimulation of low-k. camp phosphodiesterase. to determine if the stimulation of the low-km camp phosphodiesterase activity required the activation of a protein kinase,
intact platelets were preincubated for 10 min at 30°c with the
protein kinase inhibitor  xxxd736xxx  (100 ,um) prior to treatment ofthe
platelets with  xxxd1742xxx .  xxxd736xxx  has been reported to inhibit
camp-dependent protein kinase (30). in the experiment
depicted in fig. 3, the increase in the blue dextran-purified
low-km camp phosphodiesterase activity was inhibited
about 60% when platelets were preincubated for 10 min with
100 ,um  xxxd736xxx , indicating that camp-dependent protein kinase
was involved at some point in the stimulatory process.  xxxd736xxx 
can also inhibit protein kinase c (30) but there is no evidence
that camp can stimulate this enzyme.
evidence for phosphorylation of low-k. camp phosphodiesterase. to test whether the stimulation of the low-km
camp phosphodiesterase activity was accompanied by phosphorylation of the enzyme, platelets were preincubated with
carrier-free 32po4 to label the internal adenosine nucleotides,
including atp, prior to treatment with  xxxd1742xxx . the 32p_
labeled platelets were then treated with  xxxd1742xxx  and lysed,
and the low-km camp phosphodiesterase was isolated by
blue dextran-sepharose chromatography. the fractions from
the blue dextran-sepharose column containing the low-km
camp phosphodiesterase activity were pooled and run on
nadodso4-containing polyacrylamide gels (19), and the gels
were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. as shown in
fig. 4, incubation of platelets with  xxxd1742xxx  resulted in a
striking increase in the phosphorylation of a polypeptide of
110 kda, the monomer molecular mass of the low-km camp

phosphodiesterase.

fig. 3. inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx  stimulation of low-km camp
phosphodiesterase (pde) activity by the protein kinase inhibitor
 xxxd736xxx . platelets were preincubated for 10 min with 100 ,um  xxxd736xxx  before
 xxxd1742xxx  treatment. the low-km camp phosphodiesterase was
purified by blue dextran-sepharose chromatography. camp phosphodiesterase activity was measured at 1 mum camp. results are
expressed as a ratio of the specific activity of the low-km camp
phosphodiesterase from  xxxd1742xxx -treated or  xxxd736xxx - and forskolintreated platelets to the specific activity of the phosphodiesterase
from untreated platelets.

to determine if this labeled protein was the low-km camp
phosphodiesterase, we prepared a nitrocellulose blot of a
nadodso4 gel of the low-km camp phosphodiesterase purified by blue dextran-sepharose chromatography from 32plabeled,  xxxd1742xxx -treated platelets. when the blot was probed
with the antiserum to the low-km camp phosphodiesterase,
2 0 01169 2.5-

a single band at 110 kda, which comigrated with the 32p label,
reacted with the antiserum (fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4).
to further test whether the labeled protein was the low-km
camp phosphodiesterase, the antiserum was used in conjunction with fixed s. aureus cells to isolate the phosphodiesterase directly from a platelet lysate. analysis of the
immunoprecipitated protein by nadodso4/page revealed
a major 32p-labeled band at 110 kda (fig. 5), confirming that
the stimulation of the low-km camp phosphodiesterase
activity is accompanied by phosphorylation of the phosphodiesterase molecule.
stimulation and phosphorylation of low-km camp phosphodiesterase by  xxxd2331xxx .  xxxd1742xxx  is a useful tool in probing
camp-mediated intracellular regulation but is of course not
present in vivo. in contrast, prostacyclin (prostaglandin i2) is
the major product of  xxxd208xxx  metabolism produced
by vascular cells and serves as a potent inhibitor of platelet
function as well as a vasodilator under a variety of pathophysiological circumstances (31). since prostacyclin has a
short half-life in solution, we chose to use the stable analog
 xxxd2331xxx  ( xxxd2331xxx ). prostacyclin and  xxxd2331xxx  activate adenylate cyclase by a receptor-linked mechanism utilizing the
same receptor (32).
we therefore tested whether  xxxd2331xxx  would also produce a
stimulation of platelet low-km camp phosphodiesterase activity by phosphorylation of the enzyme.  xxxd2331xxx , like prostacyclin, produces a transitory rise in intracellular levels of
camp with the maximal rise occurring at 0.1 am  xxxd2331xxx 
after 4-5 min of incubation (33).
when platelets were incubated with  xxxd2331xxx , the activity of
the low-km camp phosphodiesterase was stimulated 2.3-fold
(±0.6-fold) and the enzyme was phosphorylated (fig. 4). the
level of stimulation of the low-km camp phosphodiesterase
activity produced by  xxxd2331xxx  was not as dramatic as that
produced by  xxxd1742xxx . this difference is consistent with the
fact that  xxxd1742xxx  produces both a greater increase in and a
more prolonged elevation of intracellular camp. these
effects on camp levels should result in greater activation of
the camp-dependent protein kinase and thus more dramatic
activation of the low-km phosphodiesterase.
subsequent to our initial report of these results (14),
macphee et al. (34) reported results of a similar experiment
using platelets incubated with  xxxd124xxx . the level of
stimulation of the low-kin, cgmp-inhibited phosphodiesterase activity that they observed was less than that described
here-i.e., 1.4-fold compared to 10-fold for  xxxd1742xxx  or
2.3-fold for  xxxd2331xxx .

kinase preparation as well as a purified camp-dependent
protein kinase. however, they reported no change in the
activity of the phosphodiesterase upon phosphorylation. this
result is in marked contrast to the stimulation we observed
when the low-km camp phosphodiesterase is phosphorylated in intact platelets. whether this difference can be
explained by phosphorylation of a different site in intact cells
or whether phosphorylation is due to a different intracellular
protein kinase is unknown at this time.
our results support the hypothesis that the stimulation of
phosphodiesterase activity in platelets following incubation
of the cells with adenylate cyclase agonists is due to phosphorylation of the phosphodiesterase molecule. phosphorylation may be a major mechanism for regulation of the activity
of the low-km camp phosphodiesterase in platelets. such
activation of the phosphodiesterase following direct or receptor-mediated stimulation of the adenylate cyclase serves
as a negative feedback modulating the responses of platelets
to adenylate cyclase agonists. this increase in camp phosphodiesterase activity could play a major role in the downregulation of platelets to further exposure to adenylate
cyclase agonists.
phosphorylation of other phosphodiesterases in purified or
partially purified systems has been reported (11, 35-41).
different subunits of the purified ca2+/calmodulin-sensitive
phosphodiesterase from bovine brain were phosphorylated
by camp-dependent protein kinase and by a ca2+/calmodulin-sensitive protein kinase. these phosphorylations caused
no change in the basal activity of the phosphodiesterase but
decreased the binding affinity of the enzyme for calmodulin
(37, 38). the plasma membrane phosphodiesterase in rat
hepatocytes is stimulated when the cells are exposed to
insulin in the presence of glucagon (35, 36). this activation
appears to be due to a phosphorylation mechanism since the
stimulation can be reversed when membranes isolated from
treated cells are incubated with alkaline phosphatase (35, 36).
the enzyme can also be directly phosphorylated in a purified
membrane preparation by camp-dependent protein kinase,
resulting in a stimulation of the phosphodiesterase activity
(35, 36).
this low-km camp, cgmp-inhibited phosphodiesterase
may have an important role in the regulation of other cells.
this phosphodiesterase may play an important role in controlling cardiac muscle contractility and may be the target of
a number of cardiotonic drugs (11, 42). such drugs are also
potent inhibitors of platelet aggregation, suggesting that the
low-km camp phosphodiesterase may be important in regulating platelet responses. the insulin-stimulated phosphodiesterase from rat adipocytes has been reported to be
kinetically and immunologically similar to the low-km,
cgmp-inhibited phosphodiesterase from bovine heart and
human platelets (12, 43). the method of control of this
enzyme is unknown but the maintenance of stimulation
through partial purification suggests that the stimulation is
due to a covalent modification of the enzyme, possibly
phosphorylation (12).
the presence of a cgmp-inhibited phosphodiesterase as
well as a cgmp-stimulated phosphodiesterase in platelets
suggests that cgmp may play an important role in regulating
camp metabolism. since the km values of the two enzymes
differ by an order of magnitude (9, 24) it is possible that cgmp
regulates the basal and stimulated levels of camp. recent
reports that  xxxg1587xxx  agonists inhibit platelet responses and increase camp levels in platelets suggest that
the low-km, cgmp-inhibited phosphodiesterase may be inhibited by cgmp in intact cells and may play a role in the
linkage of camp and cgmp metabolism in platelets (44-46).
