hereditary polyuric disorders:
new concepts and differential diagnosis
daniel g. bichet
the identification, characterization, and mutational analysis of genes coding for key proteins to the mechanisms of urine concentration provide the basis for understanding the 2
types of hereditary  xxxg231xxx  (ndi): a pure type characterized by loss
of water only, and a complex type characterized by loss of water and ions. patients with
hereditary ndi bearing mutations in  xxxg231xxx , the gene coding for the  xxxd3495xxx 
2 receptor, or in aqp2, the gene coding for the vasopressin-sensitive water channel, have
a pure ndi phenotype with loss of water, but normal conservation of sodium, potassium,
chloride, and calcium. patients bearing inactivating mutations in 1 of the 5 genes
( xxxg2078xxx ,  xxxg1249xxx , clcnkb,  xxxg473xxx , and clcnkb in combination, or bsnd) that
encode the membrane proteins of the thick ascending limb of the loop of henle have a
complex polyuro-polydipsic syndrome with loss of water, sodium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and potassium. the purpose of this article is to increase the general awareness of
these congenital ndi patients to prevent severe episodes of dehydration and provide
precise molecular diagnosis and treatment.

wo sisters (9 and 11 years old) were referred for investigation of congenital polyuria and repeated episodes of
dehydration during their first year of life. both were born
prematurely (32 and 29 weeks, respectively) of apparently
nonconsanguineous french-canadian parents and were
transferred in the perinatal period from the lac st-jean region
in northern quebec to a pediatric hospital in montreal for
rehydration.
the prematurity was attributed to polyhydramnios, which
occurred during both pregnancies.
the urine osmolalities of these 2 patients were unresponsive to vasopressin. a diagnosis of congenital partial  xxxg231xxx  (ndi) was made and the polyuropolydipsic manifestations subsequently were reasonably well

controlled with hydrochlorothiazide and indomethacin.
however, hyponatremic dehydration episodes were encountered often. a renal ultrasound showed medullary nephrocalcinosis in both patients.
a dehydration test (fig 1) performed 5 years before the
present referral showed, in both patients, a plasma sodium
level of 143 to 145 meq/l, with a concomitant urine osmolality of 231 to 253 mosm/kg and plasma vasopressin concentrations of 8 to 32 pg/ml. urine osmolality was unchanged or decreased after the administration of 1.0 ␮g
intravenous 1-desamino[8- xxxd862xxx ]vasopressin ( xxxd1847xxx ).
on physical examination, both girls were small for their
age (10th percentile) and were concerned and reluctant
about the possibility of repeating another dehydration
test. blood pressure, pulse, and oral temperature readings
were normal. a  xxxd1847xxx  infusion test was performed as
previously described.1,2 indomethacin treatment was discontinued 1 week before testing and water was not restricted during the test. the  xxxd1847xxx  test showed normal
plasma sodium values but consistently low plasma potassium concentrations and a relatively mild to moderate
concentration defect with urine osmolalities greater than
250 mosm/kg after  xxxd1847xxx  (fig 2).

figure 1 measurements during a dehydration test followed by the
administration of 1 ␮g of  xxxd1847xxx  intravenously to 2 sisters subsequently found to have bartter syndrome (see fig 2). the dehydration test was performed at 4 (patient 1, left) and 6 years of age
(patient 2, right). the 24-hour urine volume was 90 ml/kg of body
weight in patient 2 (normal ⱕ30 ml/kg body weight). plasma  xxxd3495xxx  (avp and plasma renin activity were very high
during the test (21-51 pg/ml for avp and 19-23 ng/ml/h for
plasma renin activity, respectively).

regulated transepithelial water
permeability in the collecting
duct: role of  xxxg231xxx  and aqp2
the urinary concentration mechanisms require near-isosmolar fluid absorption in the proximal tubule, countercurrent
multiplication/exchange to generate a hypertonic medullary
interstitium, and regulated transepithelial permeability in the
collecting duct.3 the basolateral  xxxg231xxx  and the luminal
aqp2 proteins are 2 critical components of the transepithelial water permeability of the principal cells of the collecting
ducts (fig 3) because loss-of-function of either of these proteins will result in ndi.
the human gene that codes for the  xxxg231xxx  ( xxxg231xxx ) is
located in chromosome region xq28 and has 3 exons and 2
small introns. the sequence of the complementary dna predicts a polypeptide of 371 amino acids with 7 transmembrane, 4
extracellular, and 4 cytoplasmic domains (fig 4). the  xxxg231xxx  is 1 of 701 members of the rhodopsin family within the
superfamily of guanine-nucleotide (g) protein– coupled receptors4 (see also the perspective by perez5). the activation of the v2
receptor on renal collecting tubules stimulates adenylyl cyclase

via the stimulatory g protein and promotes the cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (camp)-mediated incorporation of water pores
into the luminal surface of these cells. this process is the molecular basis of the vasopressin-induced increase in the osmotic
water permeability of the apical membrane of the collecting
tubule.6
the gene that codes for the water channel of the apical membrane of the kidney collecting tubule has been designated aquaporin 2 (aqp2) and was cloned by homology to the rat aquaporin of the collecting duct. the human aqp2 gene is located in
chromosome region 12q13 and has 4 exons and 3 introns. it is
predicted to code for a polypeptide of 271 amino acids that is
organized into 2 repeats oriented at 180° to each other and has
6 membrane-spanning domains, with both terminal ends located intracellularly, and conserved asparagine-proline-alanine
boxes (fig 5). it is now well recognized that aquaporins are
transmembrane channels that are found in cell membranes of all
life forms that efficiently transport water while excluding pro-

figure 2 measurements for 2 sisters with bartter syndrome (left,
middle columns) compared with a patient with ndi (right column)
during a  xxxd1847xxx  infusion test. the 2 sisters with polyuria, polydipsia, hypokaliema, hypocalcemia, and nephrocalcinosis are homozygous for the a177t mutation in the  xxxg1249xxx  gene38 (arthus et al,
unpublished data). the  xxxd1847xxx  infusion tests1 were performed at 9
(patient 1, left panel) and 11 years of age (patient 2, middle panel).
indomethacin treatment was discontinued 1 week before testing;
water was not restricted during the test. the plasma vasopressin
level was very low (⬍0.5 pg/ml) during the test, but the plasma
renin activity was increased (20 ng/ml/h in patient 1, 10 ng/ml/h in
patient 2). the low chloride entry in the cells of the macula densa,
which is secondary to the loss of function of  xxxg1249xxx , explains the
very high levels of plasma renin activity.35 by contrast, patients with
 xxxg231xxx  (4-year-old patient with ndi and the  xxxg231xxx  a132d mutation,44 right) or aqp2 mutations generally have low urine osmolality
unresponsive to  xxxd1847xxx , normal plasma potassium level, high vasopressin level, and normal plasma renin activity. data from fujiwara and bichet45 with permission.

figure 3 the effect of avp on increasing water permeability in the principal cells of the collecting duct. note that na
reabsorption, through the epithelial na channel, is not represented. avp is bound to the  xxxg231xxx  (a g-protein–
linked receptor) on the basolateral membrane. the basic process of g-protein– coupled receptor signaling consists of
3 steps: a hepta-helical receptor that detects a ligand (in this case, avp) in the extracellular milieu, a g-protein that
dissociates into ␣ subunits bound to  xxxd2247xxx  and ␤␥ subunits after interaction with the ligand-bound
receptor, and an effector (in this case, adenylyl cyclase) that interacts with dissociated g-protein subunits to generate
small-molecule second messengers. avp activates adenylyl cyclase, increasing the intracellular concentration of camp.
the topology of adenylyl cyclase is characterized by 2 tandem repeats of 6 hydrophobic transmembrane domains
separated by a large cytoplasmic loop and terminates in a large intracellular tail. generation of camp follows receptorlinked activation of the heteromeric g-protein and interaction of the free g␣s chain with the adenylyl cyclase catalyst.
pka is the target of the generated camp. cytoplasmic vesicles carrying the water channel proteins (represented as
homotetrameric complexes) are fused to the luminal membrane in response to avp, thereby increasing the water
permeability of this membrane. microtubules and actin filaments are necessary for vesicle movement toward the
membrane. the mechanisms underlying docking and fusion of aqp2-bearing vesicles are not known. the detection of
the small  xxxd2247xxx  binding protein rab3a,  xxxg2403xxx , and syntaxin 4 in principal cells suggests
that these proteins are involved in aqp2 trafficking. when avp is not available, water channels are retrieved by an
endocytic process, and water permeability returns to its original low rate. aqp3 and aqp4 water channels are
expressed on the basolateral membrane. atp,  xxxd83xxx .

tons. in the kidney, at least 6 aquaporins are expressed:  xxxg180xxx  in
plasma membranes of the proximal tubule, thin descending
limb of henle, and descending vasa recta; aqp2 in the apical
membrane and intracellular vesicles of collecting duct principal
cells; aqp3 and aqp4 in the basolateral membranes of the same
principal cells; aqp6 in intracellular vesicles of collecting duct
intercalated cells; and aqp7 in the s3 segment of the proximal
tubule.3 molecular dynamic simulations suggest that a global
orientation control mechanism facilitates efficient movement of
a single column of water molecules while preventing proton
transport in the channel.7 data from mouse models suggest that

aqp3 and aqp4 may play an important role in urinary concentration at the basolateral membrane.3
in the collecting duct, the first step in the antidiuretic
action of avp is its binding to the vasopressin  xxxg231xxx 
(fig 3) located on the basolateral membrane of collecting
duct cells. this step initiates a cascade of events—receptor-linked activation of the cholera toxin-sensitive g-protein, activation of adenylyl cyclase, production of camp,
and stimulation of  xxxg1836xxx  (pka)—which leads to
the final step in the antidiuretic action of avp. that is, the
exocytic insertion of specific water channels, aqp2, into

aqp4 are the constitutive water channels in the basolateral membranes of renal medullary collecting ducts.
avp also increases the water reabsorptive capacity of the
kidney by regulating the urea transporter ut-a1/3, which is
present in the inner medullary collecting duct, predominantly in its terminal part.12,13 avp also increases the permeability of principal collecting duct cells to sodium.14
in summary, as stated elegantly by ward et al,15 in the
absence of avp stimulation, collecting duct epithelia show
very low permeabilities to sodium urea and water. these
specialized permeability properties permit the excretion of
large volumes of hypotonic urine formed during intervals of
water diuresis. in contrast, avp stimulation of the principal
cells of the collecting ducts leads to selective increases in the
permeability of the apical membrane to water, urea, and na.

the luminal membrane thereby increases the permeability
of the luminal membrane. aqp2 is the vasopressin-regulated water channel in renal collecting ducts. it is present
exclusively in the kidney, in principal cells of inner medullary collecting duct cells, and is distributed diffusely in
the cytoplasm in the euhydrated condition, whereas apical
staining of aqp2 is intensified in the dehydrated condition or after administration of  xxxd1847xxx , a synthetic structural analog of avp. the short-term aqp2 regulation by
avp involves the movement of aqp2 from intracellular
vesicles to the plasma membrane, a confirmation of the
shuttle hypothesis of avp action that was proposed 2 decades ago.8 in the long-term regulation, which requires a
sustained increase of circulating avp levels for 24 hours or
longer, avp increases the abundance of water channels.
this is thought to be a consequence of increased transcription of the aqp2 gene. the activation of pka leads to
phosphorylation of aqp2 on serine residue 256 in the
cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus. this phosphorylation step
is essential for the regulated movement of aqp2-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane during increases of
intracellular camp. phosphorylation of at least 3 of 4
monomers of an aqp2 tetramer is sufficient to redistribute
aqp2 tetramers from storage vesicles to the apical membrane.9 drugs that disrupt microtubules or actin filaments
have long been known to inhibit the hormonally induced
permeability response in target epithelia10 and sabolic et
al11 have shown that microtubules are required for the
apical polarization of aqp2 in principal cells. aqp3 and

x-linked ndi is generally a rare disease in which affected
male patients do not concentrate their urine after administration of avp.16 because this form is a rare and recessive

affected, but heterozygous females can show variable degrees of polyuria and polydipsia because of skewed x

four, 25, and 21 affected male patients now belong to inserts a, b,
and c, respectively. furthermore, our analysis of additional maritime families confirm that carriers of the hopewell mutation were
prevalent in the maritime area at the time the hopewell ship landed
(arthus and bichet, unpublished data). therefore, the w71x mutation is not likely to be linked to hopewell immigrants, but rather
to other ulster scots.

proximately 8.8 in 1,000,000 male live births.17 a founder
effect of 2 particular  xxxg231xxx  mutations, 1 in ulster scot
immigrants (the hopewell mutation, w71x) and 1 in a
large utah kindred (the cannon pedigree), results in an
increased prevalence of x-linked ndi in their descendants
in certain communities in nova scotia, canada, and in
utah (united states). these founder mutations have now
spread all over the north-american continent. to date, we
have identified the w71x mutation in 42 affected male
individuals who reside predominantly in the maritime
provinces of nova scotia and new brunswick (fig 6), and
the l312x mutation in 8 affected male individuals who
reside in the central united states. we know of 98 living
affected male individuals of the hopewell kindred and 18
living affected male individuals of the cannon pedigree.
to date, 183 putative disease-causing  xxxg231xxx  mutations
have been published in 287 ndi families (fig 4). eightynine of these 183 mutations are missense mutations likely
to be misfolded, trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum
and unable to reach the basolateral cell surface to engage
the circulating  xxxd3495xxx , avp. most of the
 xxxg231xxx  mutants that we and other investigators have tested
are type 2 mutant receptors. they did not reach the cell
membrane and were trapped in the interior of the cell.18-21
other mutant g-protein– coupled receptors22 and gene
products causing genetic disorders also are characterized
by protein misfolding. mutations that affect the folding of
secretory proteins; integral plasma membrane proteins; or
enzymes destined to the endoplasmic reticulum, golgi
complex, and lysosomes results in loss-of-function phenotypes irrespective of their direct impact on protein function because these mutant proteins are prevented from

d.g. bichet
reaching their final destination.23 folding in the endoplasmic reticulum is the limiting step: mutant proteins that fail
to fold correctly are retained initially in the endoplasmic
reticulum and subsequently often degraded.
if the misfolded protein/traffic problem that is responsible for so many human genetic diseases can be overcome
and the mutant protein can be transported out of the endoplasmic reticulum to its final destination, then these
mutant proteins could be sufficiently functional.24 therefore, using pharmacologic chaperones, or pharmacoperones, to promote escape from the endoplasmic reticulum is
a possible therapeutic approach.23,25,26 we used selective
nonpeptide v2 and v1 receptor antagonists to rescue the
cell-surface expression and function of naturally occurring
misfolded human v2 receptors.18 because the beneficial
effect of nonpeptide v2 antagonists could be secondary to
prevention and interference with endocytosis, we studied
the r137h mutant previously reported to lead to constitutive endocytosis. we found that the antagonist did not
prevent the constitutive ␤-arresting–promoted endocytosis.19 these results indicate that as for other  xxxg231xxx  mutants, the beneficial effects of the treatment result from the
action of the pharmacologic chaperones. in clinical studies, we administered a nonpeptide v1a vasopressin antagonist sr49059 to 5 adult patients who have ndi and bear
the del62 to 64, r137h, and w164s mutations. sr49059
significantly decreased urine volume and water intake and
increased urine osmolality (fig 7), whereas sodium, potassium, and creatinine excretions and plasma sodium
were constant throughout the study.27 this new therapeutic approach could be applied to the treatment of several
hereditary diseases resulting from errors in protein folding
and kinesis.24,26

misfolding, and/or mistargeting
to date, 35 putative disease-causing aqp2 mutations have
been identified in 40 ndi families (fig 5). the oocytes of the
african clawed frog (xenopus laevis) have provided a most
useful experimental system for studying the function of many
channel proteins. this convenient expression system was key
to the discovery of  xxxg180xxx  by agre28 because frog oocytes have
very low permeability and survive even in fresh water ponds.
control oocytes were injected with water alone; test oocytes
were injected with various quantities of synthetic transcripts
from  xxxg180xxx  or aqp2 dna complementary rna (crna).
when subjected to a 20-mosm osmotic shock, control oocytes had exceedingly low water permeability but test oocytes
became highly permeable to water. these osmotic water permeability assays showed an absence of or very low water
transport for all the crna with aqp2 mutations. immuno-

fluorescence and immunoblot studies showed that these recessive mutants were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum.
aqp2 mutations in autosomal-recessive ndi, which are
located throughout the gene, result in misfolded proteins
that are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. in contrast, the dominant mutations reported to date are located
in the region that codes for the carboxyl terminus of
aqp2.29-31 dominant aqp2 mutants form heterotetramers
with wt-aqp2 and are misrouted. investigation of p262l,
the only recessive mutation in the carboxyl terminus, pro-

vided new insights into the loss-of-function and oligomerization of aqp2 proteins. functional analysis in oocytes of
p262l crna indicated that, unlike other aqp2 mutants in
recessive ndi, it is a functional water channel and that
trafficking to the plasma membrane was not impaired.32
furthermore, unlike other aqp2-recessive mutants,
p262l crna forms heterotetramers with wt-aqp2 and is
routed to the apical membrane and thus in cellular experimental systems has most of the features of aqp2 mutants
in dominant ndi.

figure 8 transepithelial salt resorption in a cell of the thick ascending limb of the loop of henle (tal). thirty percent of the filtered
 xxxd3213xxx  is reabsorbed in the tal and most of the energy for
concentration and dilution of the urine derives from active nacl
transport in the tal. filtered nacl is reabsorbed through  xxxg2078xxx ,
which uses the sodium gradient across the membrane to transport
chloride and potassium into the cell. the potassium ions are recycled (100%) through the apical membrane by the  xxxg1232xxx   xxxg1249xxx . sodium leaves the cell actively through the basolateral
na-k-adenosine triphosphatase. chloride diffuses passively
through 2 basolateral channels:  xxxg473xxx  and clc-kb. both of these
chloride channels must bind to the ␤ subunit of barttin to be transported to the cell surface. four types of bartter syndrome (types
i-iv) are attributable to recessive mutations in the genes that encode
the  xxxg2078xxx  cotransporter, the  xxxg1232xxx  ( xxxg1249xxx ), 1 of the
chloride channels (cic-kb), and barttin, respectively. a fifth type of
bartter syndrome also has been shown to be a digenic disorder that
is attributable to loss-of-function mutations in the genes that encode
the chloride channels cic-ka and cic-kb.50 as a result of these
different molecular alterations,  xxxd3213xxx  is lost into the
urine, positive lumen voltage is abolished, and calcium (ca2⫹), magnesium (mg2⫹), potassium (k⫹), and ammonium (nh4⫹) cannot be
reabsorbed in the paracellular space. in the absence of mutations,

of the loop of henle (for review see bichet33 and bichet and
fujiwara34). although bartter syndrome and bartter’s mutations are used commonly as a diagnosis, it is likely, as explained by jeck et al,35 that the 2 patients with a mild phenotype originally described by dr. bartter had gitelman
syndrome, a thiazide-like salt-losing tubulopathy with a defect in the distal convoluted tubule. as a consequence, saltlosing tubulopathy of the furosemide type is a more physiologically appropriate definition.
thirty percent of the filtered  xxxd3213xxx  is reabsorbed in the thick ascending limb of the loop of henle
through the apically expressed sodium-potassium-chloride
cotransporter  xxxg2078xxx  (encoded by the  xxxg2078xxx  gene),
which uses the sodium gradient across the membrane to
transport chloride and potassium into the cell. the potassium ions must be recycled through the apical membrane by
the  xxxg1232xxx   xxxg1249xxx  (encoded by the  xxxg1249xxx  gene)
(fig 8). in the large study by peters et al,36 who studied 85
patients with a hypokalemic salt-losing tubulopathy, all 20
patients with  xxxg1249xxx  mutations (except 1) and all 12 patients
with  xxxg2078xxx  mutations were born as preterm infants after
severe polyhydramnios. of note, polyhydramnios is never

bartter syndrome (omim 601678, 241200, 607364, and

increased amniotic fluid include maternal diabetes mellitus,
fetal malformations and chromosomal aberrations, twin-totwin transfusion syndrome, rhesus incompatibility, and congenital infections.37 postnatally, polyuria was the leading
symptom in 19 of the 32 patients. renal ultrasound showed
nephrocalcinosis in 31 of these patients. these patients, similar to the 2 young sisters described at the beginning of this

ndi. as a consequence, congenital polyuria does not suggest
 xxxg231xxx  or aqp2 mutations automatically, and polyhydramnios, salt wasting, hypokalemia, and nephrocalcinosis are
important clinical and laboratory characteristics that should
be assessed. in patients with bartter syndrome (salt-losing
tubulopathy/furosemide type), the  xxxd1847xxx  test (fig 2) will
indicate only a partial type of ndi. the algorithm proposed
by peters et al36 is useful because most mutations in  xxxg2078xxx 
and  xxxg1249xxx  are found in the carboxyl terminus or in the last
exon and, as a consequence, are amenable to rapid dna
sequencing.
the 2 sisters with complex polyuria, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and nephrocalcinosis are homozygous for the
a177t mutation in the  xxxg1249xxx  gene,38 (arthus et al, unpublished data). their family tree was reconstructed (fig 9) and
both parents, heterozygous for this  xxxg1249xxx  mutation, were
found to have a common ancestor from the 17th century in
the charlevoix region of quebec. of clinical interest, patient
2 discontinued her indomethacin treatment during a recent
first pregnancy and her urine output immediately increased
from 3.48 to 7.3 l/d with concomitant increases in the 24hour urinary excretion of k⫹ (57-100 meq/d) and calcium
(14.3-22.6 meq/d). large amounts of oral potassium supple-

we propose that all families with hereditary diabetes insipidus should have their molecular defect identified. this molecular identification is of immediate clinical significance because early diagnosis and treatment of affected infants can
avert the physical and mental retardation that results from
repeated episodes of dehydration (fig 10). water should be
offered every 2 hours day and night, and temperature, appetite, and growth should be monitored. admission to the hospital may be necessary for continuous gastric feeding. the
voluminous amounts of water kept in patients’ stomachs will
exacerbate physiologic gastrointestinal reflux in infants and
toddlers, and many affected boys frequently vomit. these
young patients often improve with the absorption of an h2
blocker and with metoclopramide (which could induce extrapyramidal symptoms) or with  xxxd1927xxx , which seems
to be better tolerated and efficacious. for patients with
 xxxg231xxx  or aqp2 mutations a low-sodium diet, distal tubule
diuretics, and occasional renal prostaglandins inhibitors may
achieve a 20% to 30% decrease in urine output, but the
low-sodium diet is difficult to follow and affected children
and adults continue to drink large amounts of water. all
polyuric states (whether neurogenic, nephrogenic, or psychogenic) can induce large dilatations of the urinary tract and
bladder, and bladder function impairment has been well documented in patients who bear  xxxg231xxx  or aqp2 mutations.39,40
of interest, an inducible mouse model of ndi has been produced recently by floxed aqp2 gene deletion,41 which also
showed evidence of structural damage from the sustained
polyuria. adult  xxxg231xxx  or aqp2 knock-in mice will be useful to
test new therapies including specific pharmacochaperones.
chronic renal failure secondary to bilateral hydronephrosis
has been observed rarely as a long-term complication in some
patients. renal and abdominal ultrasound should be performed annually, and simple recommendations, including
frequent urination and double voiding, could be important to
prevent these consequences. patients with complex polyuric
disorders need to take large amounts of na⫹, k⫹, and calcium
and are improving dramatically with the administration of
prostaglandin inhibitors.35,42 surviving  xxxg1249xxx  ⫺/⫺ mice43
also will be useful to develop and test new therapies. i would
like all patients with hereditary ndi to be recognized
promptly, identified molecularly, and treated. the development of new pharmacologic correctors is a reachable shortterm therapeutic goal.
