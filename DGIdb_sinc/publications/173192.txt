1975.-while
glucocorticoid
hormones act catabolically on skeletal muscle through their binding
to glucocorticoid-specific
receptors in the cytosol, androgens exert
anabolic responses but no androgen-specific
binding
proteins
could be detected in this responsive tissue. however, various nonradioactive androgens were effective in displacing labeled dexamethasone or cortisol from their respective cytoplasmic receptors
in muscle, both in vitro and in vivo. the inhibition of glucocorticoid binding by androgens is competitive, and could be observed
following a single or repeated administration
of the androgens to
adrenalectomized-castrated
animals. the synthetic androgen
 xxxd2136xxx  and the hormone testosterone displayed ki values
of 7.5 x 10s6 m and 1 x low5 m, respectively, for the inhibition
of [ah]dexamethasone
binding in muscle cytosol. on the basis of
competition
experiments
it is postulated
that interaction
of
androgens with glucocorticoid
receptors prevents the binding of
glucocorticoids and might be responsible in part for the anabolic
effects of pharmacologic
doses of androgens in muscle.

binding;

skeletal muscle

‘ro their general
metabolic
effects on skeletal
muscle, steroids can be classified as either catabolic
or
anabolic.
following
treatment
with pharmacological
doses
of adrenal
glucocorticoids,
a catabolic
response of severe
muscle wasting
is induced,
associated with impaired
synthesis of muscle dlna, rna, and protein,
and increased
activity of several hydrolytic
enzymes (2, 3, 16, 17). two
specific glucocorticoid
binding
proteins have been recently
demonstrated
in the cytoplasmic
fraction
of rat skeletal
muscle, and it was suggested that the catabolic
action of
glucocorticoids
in this tissue is mediated
through
binding
of the active hormones to receptor proteins ( 18, 19).
androgens
are known to have strong anabolic
effects on
muscle and to antagonize
the catabolic
action of glucocorticoids
in this tissue (9, 10, 12). the protein
anabolic
effects of testosterone
account for the growth of muscle at
puberty and for the maintenance
of muscle mass in adult
animals.
androgens
promote
amino
acid incorporation
into muscle proteins, decrease amino acid catabolism,
and
cause anabolic
responses which result in tissue growth and
nitrogen
retention
(9, 10, 12, 16). in spite of the wide use
of anabolic
agents clinically
for their myotrophic
and
nitrogen-retaining
effects, the molecular
processes involved
according

institute,

in the anabolic
action of these steroids on muscle are still
not well understood.
in contrast to other steroid hormones,
which are known to bind to stereospecific
receptors in the
cytoplasmic
fraction
of responsive organs, no specific binding macromolecules
for either
testosterone
or  xxxd3240xxx 
could be demonstrated
in human
or rat
muscle cytosol (7, 11, 15).
in view of these observations
it seemed of interest to test
the possibility
that the anabolic
action of androgens
on
muscle, in the absence of specific androgen
receptors,
is
mediated through interaction
of these hormones with glucocorticoid
receptors
in muscle cytosol. androgens
might
interfere
with, and prevent binding
of glucocorticoids
in
muscle, and thus block the catabolic
response of the tissue
to circulating
glucocorticoids.
such a mechanism
of action
would be in accord with the well known antiglucocorticoid
action of androgens
in skeletal muscle ( 12).
this hypothesis was tested by following
the in vitro and
in vivo effects of natural
androgens
and several synthetic
anabolic
steroids on the binding
of [3h]dexamethasone
and
[3h]cortisol
to specific
receptors
in rat gastrocnemius

results

preliminary
experiments
had shown that castration
of
adrenalectomized
rats leads to an increase in the specific
binding
of [3h]d examethasone
in skeletal muscle cytosol.
in a typical experiment,
binding
increased from 0.087 z!z
0.030 pmol [3h]d examethasone
per milligram
protein
in
adrenalectomized
males to 0.125 + 0.043 pmol/mg
in
adrenalectomized-castrated
males (mean of four rats &
sd). this observation
suggested
an effect of androgens
on glucocorticoid
binding,
and initiated
experiments
to
determine
whether
androgens
compete
with
c3h]dexamethasone
and c3h] cortisol for binding sites in the cytosol
of rat gastrocnemius
muscle.
table 1 shows the effect of various androgens
and antiandrogens
on the in vitro specific binding
of glucocorticoid
hormones.
the potent
androgens
testosterone
and 17armethyltestosterone,
as well as the synthetic
anabolic
compounds
 xxxd2136xxx ,
methandrostenolone,
and norethandrolone
almost completely
abolished
c3h]dexamethasone binding
in muscles of adrenalectomized-castrated
rats. cyproterone
acetate, a potent antiandrogenic
steroid,
similarly
suppressed
the binding
of the labeled
glucocorticoid,
while sch 1352 1, a nonsteroidal
antiandrogen
(14, 21), enhanced
[3h]dexamethasone
binding.
table
1
also shows that the inhibition
of [3h]dexamethasone
binding
by &dihydrotestosterone
and nandrolone
was less than
with the other tested androgens.
the effects of the tested
compounds
on the specific binding
of [3h]cortisol
were less
pronounced,
although
all androgens
were observed
to
reduce the binding of the labeled glucocorticoid.
inhibition
of glucocorticoid-specific
binding
by androgens
was also
observed in the cytoplasmic
fraction
of thymocytes.
testosterone at 2 x low5 m inhibited
the specific binding
of
tritiated
triamcinolone
acetonide
in rat thymus cytosol by
72 %.
also seen in table
1 is the effect of a potent synthetic
estrogen
on glucocorticoid-specific
binding
in muscle
cytosol. diethylstilbestrol
increased the binding of [3h]dexamethasone
and [3h]cortisol
by 11 and 52 %, respectively,
over the control values.
the results shown in table 1 suggest a direct interaction
of several anabolic
hormones with the cytoplasmic
binding
sites of glucocorticoids,
leading
to decreased
binding
of
the catabolic
hormones
dexamethasone
and cortisol. the
quantitative
differences
as well as the different
order of
relative
potencies of the tested compounds
on binding
of
dexamethasone,
as compared
to the binding
of cortisol,
are in accord with earlier observations
on the presence of
two distinct receptor sites for the two glucocorticoids
in rat
skeletal muscle (18, 19). the ability of diethylstilbestrol

anabolic

receptors

enhance [3h]cortisol
binding
in muscle is also of interest
since the protein in muscle which binds [3h]cortisol
shows
several similarities
with
plasma
corticosteroid
binding
protein (cbg), and the level of the latter was reported
to
increase following
treatment
with estrogens (4).
the effect of a potent androgen
on the amount of [3h]dexamethasone
specifically
bound
in muscle cytosol was
further tested and the results shown in fig. 1. addition
of
 xxxd2136xxx 
is observed to inhibit
the binding
of [3h]dexamethasone
in a concentration-dependent
manner.
to
further
assess the nature of the androgen
effect on glucocorticoid
binding,
muscle cytosol was incubated
with increasing amounts of [3h]dexamethasone
in the presence or
absence of a constant
amount
of either testosterone
or
 xxxd2136xxx 
(fig. 2). a double reciprocal
plot of the
results shows that the apparent
affinity of the cytosol receptor for labeled dexamethasone,
but not the total number
of available sites, was decreased in the presence of anabolic
steroids. this indicates
the competitive
nature of the inhibition
exerted by androgens
on glucocorticoid
binding.
from fig. 2 the apparent
ki values of 7.5 x 10v6 m and
1 x 1o+ m for  xxxd2136xxx 
and testosterone,
respectively, were obtained.
the observed
inhibition
of glucocorticoid
binding
by
anabolic
steroids is likely to be caused by the binding
of
androgens
to glucocorticoid
receptors
and a concomitant
displacement
of the bound [3h]dexamethasone
or [3h]cortisol from their binding
sites. the high ki values for inhibition (fig. 2) and the fact that labeled androgens
with a
sufficiently
high specific activity are unavailable
preclude
experimental
demonstration
of such binding.
therefore,
when muscle cytosol from adrenalectomized
castrated rats
was incubated
with 2 x 10m8 m of [3h]testosterone
or
9 x lo-’ m [3h]5cy-dihydrotestosterone
under conditions
suitable for glucocorticoid
binding,
only a very low amount
of androgen
was bound. most of this low binding was nonspecific and could not be appreciably
displaced by a l,ooofold excess of the unlabeled
androgen.
for example, from a
total of 38 fmol of [3h]testosterone
bound per milligram
of
cytosol protein,
only 5 fmol could be displaced
by 5 x
10e5 m unlabeled
testosterone.
essentially
similar
results
were obtained
with [3h] xxxd3240xxx .
the inability
of high concentrations
of unlabeled
androgens
to
displace the tritiated
androgen
suggests that the period of
incubation
was too short to obtain equilibrium,
or that a
relatively
large proportion
of the androgen
binding
was to
unsaturable
sites.
the in vitro studies suggested that the antiglucocorticoid
activity of androgens
was due to their direct interaction
with muscle glucocorticoid
receptors.
however,
androgen
could also affect the intracellular
turnover of glucocorticoidbinding
proteins and modify the rate of receptor synthesis,
degradation,
or replenishment
in the cytosol in vivo. if
competition
for binding
is solely responsible
for the antiglucocorticoid
effects of androgens,
then a reduced binding
of glucocorticoids
is expected
to occur shortly following
if, however,

ment described
in table 2 compared
the effect of a single
injection
versus four daily injections
of various steroids on
the binding
of tritiated
dexamethasone
and cortisol
in
muscle cytosol. the results shown in table 2 indicate that
most of the tested androgens, when administered
to adrenalectomized
castrated
males 2 h prior
to sacrifice
(short
term) or given for 4 days (long-term
treatment)
caused a
reduction
in the in vitro specific binding of dexamethasone
in muscle cytosol. in the short-term
experiment,
norethandrolone,
testosterone,
and  xxxd2136xxx 
appeared
to be
the most potent inhibitors
of [3h]dexamethasone
binding.

was also active in the long-term

a wide range of potencies
in terms of the reduction
in glucocorticoid-binding,
but
the effect of short-term

was in most cases, qualitatively similar
to that of the long term treatment.

clearance of testosterone following
its prolonged
administration, which is known to induce hepatic drug-metabolizing
with those indicatenzymes (8). these results, together
ing direct in vitro competition
of androgens
on glucocorticoid
binding
(table
1), are taken as evidence that the
reduction
in glucocorticoid
binding
following
androgen
administration
reflects the interaction
of the hormonse
with available
receptor sites. however,
the results do not
exclude the possibility of slow adaptive changes in hormone
receptor
concentration.
the differential
responses of the
[3h]dexamethasone
and [3h]cortisol
binding
reactions
to
steroid
administration
further
substantiates
earlier
suggestions as to the differences in the physicochemical
properties and physiological
role of the two types of glucocorticoid receptors in muscle ( 18, 19).
table
2 also shows that the active estrogens diethylstilbestrol
and p-estradiol,
given as a single dose or for
several days, did not interfere with the cytoplasmic
binding
of either dexamethasone
or cortisol,
and that long-term
pretreatment
with estrogens enhances the binding
of these
two glucocorticoids.
it is well known
that estrogens increase plasma
cbg, and thus their effect on muscle
[3h]cortisol
binding
might reflect the presence of a cbglike binding
protein in this tissue (20).
in view of the foregoing
observations,
it is possible that
the known
differences
in relative
muscle weight,
protein
content, and dna level between males and females might
be due to differences in the concentration
of available glucocorticoid
receptor sites in the two sexes. an experiment
was
conducted
in which
binding
of labeled
glucocorticoids
was compared
in muscles from male and female
rats.
figure 3 shows that the amount
of either [3h]dexamethasone, [3h] triamcinolone
acetonide,
or [3h]progesterone
which binds to muscle cytosol is slightly higher in muscle
from male as compared
to female rats. however, the differ-

mayer

and

ence is statistically
insignificant
at the level of p < 0.05,
suggesting
that androgens
at physiological
levels do not
reduce glucocorticoid
binding.
in contrast,
the binding
of
[3h]cortisol
and of [3h] xxxd3240xxx 
in female
rats is almost twice as high as that observed in males of
the same age, and the sex differences
in binding
are statistically
significant
for both [3h]cortisol
(p < 0.01) and
5cy-dihydrotestosterone
(p < 0.05). sex dependency
of
binding
of these latter hormones
in plasma -was already
reported,
and a similar effect in muscle might reflect the
presence
of transcortin-like
steroid binding
proteins in this
i
tissue.
discussion

it is becoming
increasingly
evident that the initial event
in the action of a steroid hormone
requires the interaction
of the hormone
with sdecific cvtonlasmic
recenters in the
target tissue (23, 24). in spite of the well-known
responsiveness of muscle to androgens,
some evidence suggests that
in this particular
case, the mechanism
of action of the hormone is different
and does not involve androgen-specific
cytoplasmic
receptors
(7). several investigators
were unsuccessful
in demonstrating
the presence
of specific
androgen-binding
proteins in skeletal muscle, using labeled
testosterone,
5ar-dihydrotestosterone,
and other androgens
in these studies (7, 11, 15). 0 ur results similarly
indicate
that only traces of the natural
androgen
testosterone or its
biologically
potent metabolite,
5ar-dihydrotestosterone,
are
specifically
bound in the cytosol of rat gastrocnemius
muscle,
despite the marked
anabolic
effects of both steroids in
this tissue. these observations
are possibly due to the high
kn values for androgen
binding,
as reflected
by the high
ki value for their inhibitory
effect on glucocorticoid
binding
(fig. 2). thus, muscle seems to be distinct
from other
androgen-responsive
tissues insofar as it lacks the capacity
to bind this class of steroid hormones
with high affinity

anabolic

steroids

and

glucocorticoid

receptors

and in a specific manner. absence of high-affinity
androgen
receptors might also explain the observations
that protein
synthesis in muscle could be stimulated
by androgens
only
when administered
in vivo, and findings that, when added
in vitro directly to the muscle, androgens
failed to produce
an anabolic
response (1). however,
these findings
could
also be explained
by the need for an active metabolite
of
testosterone
to be synthesized
in an organ other than
muscle, before any biological
response can occur.
our data support
a different
mechanism
of action of
androgens in muscle from that proposed for these hormones
in the accessory sexual glands, which appear
to involve
binding
to cytoplasmic
receptors.
the results obtained
can be explained
on the basis of a working
hypothesis,
whereby
receptors for anabolic
steroids in skeletal muscle
bind androgens
with a relatively
low affinity. one possible
mechanism
for the anabolic
responsiveness
of muscle to
anabolic
hormones
given in pharmacologic
doses might
therefore be a change, induced by androgens,
in the ability
of the tissue to bind circulating
glucocorticoids,
thus reducing the glucocorticoid-dependent
catabolism
of muscle.
such an antiglucocorticoid
effect of androgens
would explain the generally
observed
anticatabolic
properties
of
male sex hormones
(12). a number
of studies suggest that
there may be an antagonistic
relationship
between
androgens and glucocorticoids
in several tissues. for example,
interaction
of androgens
with cytoplasmic
receptors
for
glucocorticoids
might explain the “anti-inducer”
effect of
testosterone reported
in htc cells by rousseau et al. (24).
in other studies, singer et al. (25) observed
that testosterone is a potent competitor
for [3h]cortisol
binding
to a
glucocorticoid-binding
protein
in liver. thus, androgendependent
inhibition
of glucocorticoid
binding,
either by
direct competition
for binding
to receptor sites or by inducing
conformational
changes in glucocorticoid-binding
molecules,
could result in a reduced
response to glucocorticoids.
further
support for this hypothesis
comes from
earlier reports by parra and reddy (22) that cortisol is as
efficient as testosterone
in reducing
the uptake of labeled
testosterone in various tissues of the rat.
the results presented
herein indicate
that testosterone
and other androgens can compete in vitro and in vivo with

in

muscle

the synthetic
glucocorticoids
dexamethasone
and triamcinolone
acetonide as well as with cortisol for binding
to
specific
glucocorticoid
receptors
in rat gastrocnemius
muscle. the basis for the failure to demonstrate
significant
binding
of [3hjandrogens
to these receptors in muscle remains to be explained.
the most likely explanation
is that
the androgen-receptor
complex has a high kd value and is
extremely
labile.
attempts
to stabilize
this complex
by
increasing
the concentration
of [3h]testosterone
to lo-’ m
in the in vitro system used to demonstrate
binding
and by
adding
“cold”
testosterone
to this preparation
have not
been successful. until the stability
of this complex can be
achieved, it will not be possible to determine
whether
the
binding
of androgen
to the glucocorticoid
receptor
in
muscle yields a complex
with a conformation
different
from that observed for the corticosteroids.
our data offer support for the view that pharmacological
doses of androgens
act to block the catabolic
effects of
glucocorticoids
at the level of glucocorticoid
receptors in
muscle. apart from this hypothesis, other mechanisms
may
account for the anticatabolic
action of androgens
in muscle.
these include:
i) a stimulatory
effect of androgens
on the
level of the glucocorticoid
binding
globulin
(cbg)
in
plasma, leading to a reduced concentration
of the corticosteroid available
to muscle (12) ; however, such a possibility
was recently rejected since anabolic steroids were found to
reduce the level of blood cbg (4); 2) anabolic
hormones
induce enzymes in liver which increase the metabolism
of
glucocorticoid,
c to inactive
metabolites
(5); 3) androgens
modify the secretion of acth
by the pituitary
or prevent
the action of  xxxd1752xxx 
on the adrenal cortex (6, 12).
