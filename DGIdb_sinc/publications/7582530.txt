1 the affinities of a number of ocl-adrenoceptor antagonists were determined by displacement of [3h] xxxd3000xxx  binding from cloned human ocla-adrenoceptors (previously designated cloned oic subtype), o1b
ocid and rat ocld-adrenoceptors, stably expressed in rat-i fibroblasts. functional affinity estimates for
these compounds were also determined from noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat aorta.
2 bmy 7378 displayed high affinity for cloned human ocld-adrenoceptors (pk,=8.2+±0.10) and was
selective over ocla (pki=6.2+0.10) and oclb subtypes (6.7+0.11). wb 4101, benoxathian and
 xxxd2914xxx  displayed high affinity for ocxa and o1d adrenoceptors compared to the olb subtype.
spiperone displayed high affinity and selectivity for alb adrenoceptors (pki 8.8 + 0.16). 5-methyl-urapidil
was selective for cloned ala adrenoceptors.
3 comparative binding affinities (pk,) for compounds at cloned human and ratld adrenoceptors were
almost identical (r = 0.99, slope = 1.08).
4  xxxd3000xxx , doxazosin and 5-methyl-urapidil were potent, competitive antagonists of noradrenalinemediated contractions of rat aorta (pa2 values of 9.8, 8.8 and 7.8 respectively). the selective o1d
antagonist bmy 7378 was also a potent antagonist on rat aorta (pkb= 8.3 + 0.1) but the interaction of
this compound was not consistent with competitive antagonism at a single population of receptors.
5 functional affinities for compounds determined against noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat
aorta correlated well with binding affinities at cloned old-adrenoceptors (r = 0.96), but not with ola
(r=0.61) or oiib (r=0.46) subtypes.
6 noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat aorta were sensitive to the alkylating effects of
chlorethylclonidine (cec). cec (10 gm) caused a small rightward shift in the noradrenaline
concentration-response curve. cec at 100 gm caused a further shift and suppression of the maximum
response to noradrenaline.
7 the results of this study suggest that noradrenaline predominantly, but not exclusively, mediates
contraction of rat aorta through the activation of an ocld-adrenoceptor.

introduction
pharmacological studies have consistently demonstrated the
existence of at least two different ol-adrenoceptor subtypes,
aci and aib, in a number of tissues. molecular cloning studies
have done much to support the existence of multiple a, subtypes and three cloned subtypes have been identified and designated ala/d, ocib and ocl, (bylund et al., 1994). however,
whilst the properties of cloned and tissue acb adrenoceptors are
clearly similar, the relationship between cloned ala/d and oc,
subtypes in relation to endogenous receptors has only recently
become clear (ford et al., 1994). when appropropriately defined in tissues such as rat submaxillary gland (michel et al.,
1989) the pharmacological properties of tissue acla-adrenoceptors have been shown to be consistent with the cloned oci
subtype (faure et al., 1994). therefore, to remove ambiguity,
both the cloned and endogenous subtype are referred to as an
aia adrenoceptor (bylund et al., 1995). thus, current al
adrenoceptor classification recognises three native and cloned
subtypes which have been designated (ia, cxi and ocid (used
throughout this paper), corresponding to cloned subtypes
previously designated as o1c, xib and nla/d (hieble et al., 1995).
tissue correlates of cloned xla adrenoceptors have been demonstrated in rat submaxillary gland, human prostate and
rabbit liver (taddei et al., 1993; faure et al., 1994) and cor-

author for correspondence.

relates of the cloned acb subtype have been shown in rat liver
and spleen (kenny et al., 1994a). however, whilst the presence
of aid-adrenoceptors has been suggested in heterogeneous
tissue populations (michel & insel, 1994), unequivocal demonstration of this endogenous subtype has not been shown to
date. this in part has been precluded by the lack of selective
compounds for this subtype, although recent preliminary evidence has indicated that bmy 7378 may be selective for
cloned cld-adrenoceptors over other oca subtypes (saussy et al.,
1994).
in an attempt to characterize the ocl-adrenoceptor mediating
the contractile response of the rat aorta, several studies have
concluded that the receptor cannot be classified as either a1a or
a1b (oriowo & ruffolo, 1992; aboud et al., 1994) although
others have suggested that a number of different subtypes
contribute to the contractile response (piascik et al., 1991; van
der graaf et al., 1993). rat aorta expresses ocld-adrenoceptors
at the mrna level (perez et al., 1991) and aboud et al. (1994)
suggested that since the pharmacological profile of the response could not be reconciled with either an a1a or ocib subtype, this tissue may possess a functional ald-adrenoceptor. in
the present study we have characterized the pharmacological
properties of rat aorta in comparison to cloned al-adrenoceptor subtypes and our data suggest that the contractile response of the rat aorta to noradrenaline is predominantly, but
not exclusively, mediated by an aid-adrenoceptor.
a preliminary account of some these data has been presented to the british pharmacological society (kenny et al.,
1994b; 1995).

methods

1959). in other experiments, estimates of affinity were determined from the negative logarithm of the antagonist dissociation constant (kb), determined from the equation
kb = [a]/(dr-1) where the dose ratio (dr) was produced by a
single concentration of antagonist [a].
in experiments with chloroethylclonidine (cec), control
concentration-response curves to noradrenaline were carried
out and the tissues were then exposed to cec (10 and 100 gm)
for 30 min followed by a 60 min washout period, after which a
second concentration-response curve to noradrenaline was
carried out.

radioligand binding studies of cloned o, adrenoceptors
cloning of rat and human a, adrenoceptor cdnas and stable
transfection into rat-i fibroblasts was carried out as previously
described (schwinn et al., 1995). the cells were grown in
dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (dmem) supplemented
with 10% foetal calf serum and 300 gg ml-'  xxxg418xxx  sulphate, a
neomycin analogue. for subculturing, cell monolayers were
washed with hank's  xxxd2988xxx  and trypsinized
briefly with 0.05% trypsin, 0.5 mm edta and divided 1: 5 to
i: 20 every 3-4 days. radioligand binding experiments were
performed with membranes prepared from rat 1 fibroblast cells
expressing individual al subtypes. scraped cells were homogenized in ice cold 50 mm  xxxd3449xxx  (ph 7.5) with a polytron
homogenizer (pt1o, setting 6, 20 s). the membranes were
washed three times by centrifugation (20 min at 48, 000 g) and
resuspended in fresh buffer before storage at -70'c. cell
membranes were stored at 0.5 mg ml-' protein. binding of
[3h]- xxxd3000xxx  was measured in 400 jil aliquots of diluted
membranes (2-10jig fibroblast protein) in 50 mm  xxxd3449xxx 
(ph 7.5) in a final assay volume of 500 gl. non specific binding
was determined in the presence of 1 gm  xxxd2914xxx . saturation isotherms were constructed by sequential dilution
from a top concentration of 8 nm [3h]- xxxd3000xxx . assays were
incubated at 25°c with [3h]- xxxd3000xxx  for 30 min and terminated by the addition of ice cold  xxxd3449xxx  and rapid cold
filtration over whatman gf/b filters under vacuum. saturation and displacement binding data were analysed by iterative
non-linear curve fitting programmes (graph pad software,
san diego, u.s.a.).

drugs used in the study
the following drugs were used: [3h]- xxxd3000xxx  from amersham
u.k.; noradrenaline,  xxxd1736xxx , and corticosterone (sigma, u.k.); chlorethylclonidine, benoxathian, urapidil,
5-methyl-urapidil, wb-4101 (2-(2,6-dimethoxyphenoxyethyl)
aminomethyl-1,4-benzodioxane hydrochloride), bmy 7378 (8[2- [4- (2-methoxyphenyl) -1-piperazinyl] ethyl] -8-azaspiro [4, 5]
decane-7,9-dione dihydrochloride), and spiperone (research
biochemicals inc., semat, u.k.);  xxxd2914xxx  hydrochloride
(ciba-geigy, basle, switzerland);  xxxd3000xxx , doxazosin, alfuzosin, indoramin and snap 1069 ([1-(3-benzoylpropyl)-4benzamidopiperidine dihydrate] were synthesized in the department of discovery chemistry, pfizer central research
(sandwich, u.k.). all other drugs and chemicals were obtained from sigma (u.k.) or b.d.h. (u.k.). drugs were dissolved in distilled h20 or dmso at 1 mm and subsequent
dilutions made in assay buffer.

contractile responses of the rat aorta

[3h1- xxxd3000xxx  binding to cloned ct, adrenoceptor

rings of thoracic aorta (approx 3 - 5 mm in length) from male
sprague-dawley rats (250-300 g) were denuded of endothelium by gentle rubbing and suspended in organ baths
under a resting tension of 1 g in krebs ringer bicarbonate of
the following composition (mm); nacl 120, kcl 5.5,
cacl2 2.5, nah2po4 1.2, mgcl2 1.2, nahco3 20, glucose ii
and edta 0.03 and gassed with 95% 02/5% co2. the solution also contained 10 gm cocaine, 10 gm corticosterone, 1 jm
propranolol and 0.5 gm yohimbine. tissues were exposed to a
sensitizing dose of (-)-noradrenaline (100 gm) and washed
over a 30 min period. isometric contractions were obtained in
response to cumulative additions of (-)-noradrenaline in the
absence and presence of antagonists (incubated for 30 min).
antagonist pa2 values were obtained from a plot of log
(agonist dr-1) against log antagonist concentration where the
slope was not different from unity (arunlakshana & schild,

the pharmacological profile of cloned rat x1c and human aia,

[3h]- xxxd3000xxx  binding from rat-l fibroblasts, stably transfected
with cdna encoding each of the oca adrenoceptor subtypes.
the expression levels of rat and human o1d subtypes were
similar (1 pmol mg-1) but were higher for human aia and a1b
subtypes (4-6 pmol mg-'). in each case, analysis of saturation
data indicated a single class of high affinity sites. kd values
(n=5-6) were 0.13+0.02nm for rat o1d and 0.34+0.05,
0.20+0.03 and 0.22+0.05 for human a1a, a1b and o1d-adrenoceptors respectively.

centrations of competing drug. displacement affinities (pki)
are shown in table 1.  xxxd3000xxx  displayed high and similar affinities (pki 9.5-9.7) for all oca adrenoceptor subtypes. bmy
displayed high affinity for cloned human acid-adrenoceptors
(pki 8.2+0.10) and was selective over aia (pki 6.2+0.10) and
mib (pki 6.7 + 0.1 1) subtypes. other compounds examined
displayed a selective profile for one or more of the receptors
studied (table 1). consistent with a previous report (michel et
al., 1989) spiperone showed moderate selectivity for aib over
ala and ocld-adrenoceptors. 5-methyl-urapidil, wb 4101, benoxathian, and  xxxd2914xxx  were selective for xla over xibadrenoceptors. 5-methyl-urapidil, indoramin and snap 1069
exhibited selectivity for a1a over ali subtypes.
displacement affinities for compounds at cloned human
and rat xld-adrenoceptors were very similar (table 1). correlation analysis (figure 1; r = 0.99, slope = 1.08) confirmed the
identical pharmacological profile of compounds for the species
homologues of the cid adrenoceptor.

aild-adrenoceptors on rat aorta

effect of cec
exposure of rat aorta to 10 gm cec caused a 3 fold dextral
shift in the crc to noradrenaline with no significant reduction
in the maximum response. after exposure to 100 jm cec,
noradrenaline curves were shifted further to the right achieving
60% of the maximum response (figure 4).

combination experiments
dose ratios (dr) were determined in the presence of 0.1 gm
bmy 7378 and 3 jm indoramin alone or in combination to
determine if the two antagonists inhibited noradrenalinemediated contraction of rat aorta through an interaction at a
common site or mutually independent sites (paton & rang,
1965). dr analysis (table 4) indicated that the experimentally

effect of competing antagonists
noradrenaline caused concentration-dependent isometric
contractions of rat aorta with a pd2 of 7.88 + 0.08 (n = 8) and a
maximum contraction of 1.5-2.0 g.  xxxd3000xxx , doxazosin and
5-methyl-urapadil shifted noradrenaline concentration-response curves (crc) to the right and schild analysis (figure 2)
yielded pa2 estimates of 9.8+0.30, 8.8+0.08 and 7.8+0.19
respectively. schild slopes (0.93, 1.02 and 1.04 respectively)
were consistent with competitive antagonism. comparison of
the functional potencies for compounds on rat aorta (table 2)
with binding affinity at cloned human cld-adrenoceptors correlated well (figure 3a; r = 0.95). in contrast, functional affinity
estimates compared poorly with binding affinities at cloned
human mlb-adrenoceptors (figure 3b; r = 0.61) and human a1aadrenoceptors (figure 3c; r = 0.46).
the selective aci antagonist, bmy 7378, also shifted noradrenaline crc to the right, yielding an apparent pkb of
8.3 + 0.1 at 0.03 gm. however, crc to noradrenaline were not
shifted proportionally relative to the increase in bmy 7378
concentration (0.03-1.0 gm). thus, the slope of the schild
plot was significantly lower than unity (0.62, 95% confidence
limits 0.45 -0.80, p <0.05). dose-ratios for bmy 7378 (table
3) were not commensurate with increasing concentrations of
antagonist employed and crc in the presence of bmy 7378
were steeper than corresponding controls.

ald-adrenoceptors

on

rat aorta

discussion
a number of different studies have attempted to characterize
the czl-adrenoceptor subtype(s) mediating the contractile response of the rat aorta, although several different conclusions
have been reached. some studies suggest that the cxl-adrenoceptor population is a homogeneous entity (mir & fozard,
1990; eltze & boer, 1992; aboud et al., 1993) which has been
postulated to be either an a1b subtype (eltze & boer, 1992) or a
receptor which cannot be classified as either oc1a or a1b (mir &
fozard, 1990; aboud et al., 1993). other studies have concluded that a number of different al subtypes contribute to the
response (piascik et al, 1991; 1994; van der graaf et al., 1993).
on the basis of the data presented in this paper, our results
support the contention suggested in some of these studies (mir
& fozard, 1990; aboud et al., 1993) that the contractile response to noradrenaline is mediated by a non o1a, nona1b
subtype. indeed, our data suggest that the contractile response
to this agonist is predominantly mediated by an aid-adrenoceptor.
functional affinity estimates on rat aorta determined with
noradrenaline were highly correlated with binding affinities
these data are
determined at the cloned
consistent with the preliminary report of saussy et al. (1994)
using phenylephrine as an agonist. this conclusion could be
drawn on the basis of binding data in the present study obtained with either cloned rat or humanacld-adrenoceptors.
recently reported studies (kenny et al., 1994b; schwinn et al.,
1995) show only minor differences between clonedal-adrenoceptors from different species. [+]-niguldipine appears to be
an exception having relatively high affinity for human and rat
ocia-adrenoceptors compared to the bovine homologue in some
(forray et al., 1994b; weinberg et al., 1994) but not all
(schwinn et al., 1995) studies. this has enabled reconciliation
a1a subtype (faure et al., 1994;
between the cloned and native
ford et al., 1994; hieble et al., 1995). in contrast to cloned m1dadrenoceptors, binding data with cloned
ala anda1b subtypes
correlated poorly with functional affinity determinations on rat
aorta. indeed, compounds with varying degrees of subtype
selectivity inhibited contractions of the aorta with binding
affinities only consistent with those determined at the old
subtype (most notably with bmy 7378, indoramin, 5-methylurapidil and snap 1069).
it is difficult to compare binding data with clonedaidadrenoceptors obtained in our study with the binding characteristics of a homogeneous population of nativeald-adrenoceptors since this has not been described to date. the
presenceofaxd-adrenoceptors has been suggested in some
heterogeneous tissue populations such as rat kidney (michel et
al., 1993). some studies have suggested that following cec
treatment of rat cortex, the population of sites is characteristic
of either
(kenny etal., 1994a) or cla-adrenoceptors (eltze
& boer, 1992), although it seems probable that the population
of sites following cec in this tissue is heterogeneous since
discriminatary compounds such as (+ )-niguldipine reveal
multiple sites after cec treatment (han & minneman, 1991;
ford etal., 1994). nevertheless, the pharmacological profile of
cloned rat and human ocld-adrenoceptors obtained in the
present study clearly differs from the characteristicsof
ala and
defined in tissues such as rat submaxillary
gland and rat liver (faure etal., 1994).
our data indicate that the contractile response of the rat
aorta in response to noradrenaline is predominantly mediated
on
subtype, and this is also
by a single receptor, namelyacd
supported by analysis of combination experiments with
bmy 7378 and indoramin. we characterized the effect of
bmy 7378 and indoramin in combination, using an indoramin concentration sufficiently high to antagonize any
putative o1a or o1b adrenoceptors present. dose-ratio analysis
of the data for the antagonists alone and in combination was
consistent with the presence of a single site for which both
antagonists mutually competed. this approach was also taken
by eltze & boer (1992) using wb-4101 and 5-methyl-urapidil,

acid-adrenoceptor.

and they also concluded that a single subtype mediated the
response to noradrenaline. however, this finding may not hold
at higher antagonist concentrations, typically evoking much
larger agonist dose-ratios and may be limited by the relative
contribution of different receptor subtypes. alternatively, another site may be present which is not effectively antagonized
by either bmy 7378 or indoramin.
it could be argued that the cec sensitivity of the contractile
response of rat aorta might be indicative of cllb-adrenoceptors
(eltze & boer, 1992); however, this conclusion is not supported
by the pharmacological profile of any of the compounds examined. both rat and human homologues of the cloned aldadrenoceptor show a moderate degree of sensitivity to alkylation by cec, greater than the xla subtype, but to a lesser
extent than the a1b subtype (forray et al., 1994a,b; schwinn et
al., 1994). the effect of cec on the rat aorta is consistent with
the sensitivity of the cloned mld-adrenoceptor to cec and
contrasts with the reported insensitivity of the xla subtype in
smooth muscle preparations (bylund et al., 1994). however, it
is often difficult to reconcile findings with cec as a means of
differentiating between subtypes since alkylation by cec is
dependent on species, time of exposure and nature of the
preparation which makes comparison of different experimental
protocols difficult. thus, the component of the noradrenaline
response that was resistant to cec in our studies could indicate incomplete alkylation of the (xld-adrenoceptor or the
presence of a cec resistant subtype(s). analysis of antagonist
profiles following cec treatment would provide some insight
into the nature of any additional component. it is interesting to
note that some al-adrenoceptor subtypes which cannot be reconciled with currently identified cloned adrenoceptors are
relatively insensitive to cec (all-adrenoceptors; muramatsu
et al., 1990).
the exclusive presence of mrna for the x1d-adrenoceptor
has been suggested in rat aorta on the basis of northern
analysis (lomasney et al., 1991) although more recent in situ
hybridization studies have indicated the presence of all three al
subtypes (piascik et al., 1994). heterogeneity of al-adrenoceptors has also been claimed on the basis of [3h]- xxxd3000xxx 
binding to rat aorta membranes in which compounds such as
wb 4101 and 5-methyl-urapidil exhibit two different binding
affinities (piasik et al., 1994). piascik et al. (1991) also reported
that the concentration-response curve to phenylephrine following cec treatment became biphasic, indicating the presence of two functional al-adrenoceptors, only one of which
was cec-sensitive. further evidence for heterogeneity of oaadrenoceptors on rat aorta has also been claimed on the basis
of other functional studies (van der graaf et al., 1994) in which
noradrenaline concentration-response curves in the presence of
several antagonists could not be accounted for by simple
competitive antagonism at a single receptor (schild slopes
lower than unity and steepening of agonist concentration-re-

sponse curve). cellular signalling pathways have previously
been used as an additional criterion for discriminating between
subtypes and in rat aorta both dependence and independence
of the al-mediated contractile response on extracellular ca2"
has been demonstrated (mir & fozard, 1990; oriowo et al.,
1990). however, differential coupling to signalling mechanisms
cannot be reliably used to classify al-adrenoceptor subtypes
(minneman, 1988) and in rat aorta since antagonist potencies
were unaffected by the presence of nifedipine, both intracellular ca2+ increases and dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium entry can be attributed to activation of a single subtype
(mir & fozard, 1990; ruffolo et al., 1991).
thus, whilst in our studies evidence indicates that a single
subtype predominantly mediates the contractile response to
noradrenaline, we cannot preclude the existence of other subtypes. using the selective a1d antagonist bmy 7378, pa2 determinations consistently yielded schild slopes less than unity
(slope = 0.62). dose-ratios were not commensurate with increasing concentrations of bmy 7378 and noradrenaline
curves were steepened in the presence of the antagonist. this
finding is consistent with the contention that noradrenaline
activates more than one receptor, although this profile was not
exhibited by other antagonists in our and other studies (eltze
& boer, 1992; aboud et al., 1993), nor is it supported by data
derived from combination studies.
a number of studies with cloned human and other mammalian al-adrenoceptors indicate that noradrenaline has
higher affinity for the cloned ocid subtype in comparison to
other subtypes (perez et al., 1991; michel & insel, 1994). since
noradrenaline displays high affinity on rat aorta (possibly reflecting a large receptor reserve), it may be possible that this
agonist is relatively selective for acld-adrenoceptors under the
conditions used in our study, to the extent that activation of
other subtypes occurs only at much higher agonist concentrations. this could account for steepening of noradrenaline curves and low schild slope with bmy 7378. taken
together, although our data suggest a predominant role for
acld-adrenoceptors in the contractile response to noradrenaline,
consistent with other reports suggesting that a single subtype
mediates the contractile response, we cannot fully exclude the
presence of other subtypes.
in summary, we have shown that the pharmacological
profile of compounds at cloned human and rat acd-adrenoceptors is consistent with functional affinity estimates determined on rat aorta. the selective (xd antagonist,
bmy 7378, also antagonized noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat aorta consistent with xid binding affinity although the profile of this compound did not suggest
competitive antagonism at a single receptor. the data in our
study suggests that noradrenaline predominantly contracts the
rat aorta through an acd-adrenoceptor, but the involvement of
other subtypes cannot be precluded at the present time.
