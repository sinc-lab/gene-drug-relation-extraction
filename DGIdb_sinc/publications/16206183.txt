abstract
dopaminergic mechanisms are thought to play a central role in the
reinforcing effects of cocaine. similar to cocaine, other local anesthetics bind to the
 xxxg2149xxx  (dat) and inhibit da uptake in rodent and monkey brain. additionally, local anesthetics are self-administered in rhesus monkeys, indicative of abuse
liability. the present study examined the reinforcing and dat effects of the local anesthetics dimethocaine, procaine and cocaine using in vivo techniques. monkeys were
trained to respond under a second-order schedule for i.v. cocaine administration (0.10
or 0.30 mg/kg/infusion). when responding was stable, dimethocaine (0.030-1.7 mg/kg/
infusion) or procaine (0.10-10 mg/kg/ infusion) was substituted for the cocaine training
dose. dimethocaine administration produced higher response rates compared with
that of procaine, and was a more potent reinforcer. drug effects on behavior were
related to dat occupancy in monkey striatum during neuroimaging with positron
emission tomography (pet). dat occupancy was determined by displacement of 8-(2[18f]ﬂuroethyl)2b-carbomethoxy-3b-(4-chlorophenyl)nortropane (fecnt). dat occupancy was between 66 and 82% and <10-41% for doses of dimethocaine and procaine
that maintained maximum response rates, respectively. finally, in vivo microdialysis
in awake subjects determined drug-induced changes in extracellular da in the caudate nucleus. there was close correspondence between peak increases in da and dat
occupancy. overall, reinforcing effects were consistent with dat effects determined
with in vivo techniques. the results further support a role for the dat in the abuse
liability of local anesthetics. synapse 58:220–228, 2005. v 2005 wiley-liss, inc.

introduction
the reinforcing effects and abuse liability of cocaine
are thought to involve its action as a dat inhibitor
(kuhar et al., 1991; ritz et al., 1987; woolverton and
johnson, 1992). in addition to cocaine, other dat
inhibitors and da receptor agonists are self-administered in animals (bergman et al., 1989; howell and
byrd, 1991; weed and woolverton, 1995; wilcox et al.,
2000, 2002). drug self-administration studies in animals have contributed substantially to our knowledge
of the neuropharmacological mechanisms underlying
cocaine abuse. for example, second-order schedules of
self-administration have been useful for evaluating
the reinforcing effects of various drug classes, including stimulants (howell and byrd, 1991; howell et al.,
1997; spear and katz, 1991; wilcox et al., 2002),

opioids (sanchez-ramos and schuster, 1977), and barbiturates (spear et al., 1991). under second-order
schedules, the occurrence of drug effects, not associated with reinforcing effects, is reduced since behavior is maintained by a relatively small number of
injections (goldberg, 1976; kelleher, 1976). therefore,
response rates generated under second-order sched-

reinforcing effects of local anesthetics

ules may be useful as a measure of drug reinforcing
effectiveness, since few injections are taken and drug
accumulation, which may affect responding under
other schedules of reinforcement, is minimized.
currently, in vivo techniques such as pet and in
vivo microdialysis are being used to study the neurochemical effects of cocaine and cocaine-like drugs that
can be related to their behavioral effects. evaluating
neurochemical drug effects in vivo may have an
advantage over more traditional in vitro approaches,
in that in vitro assays do not mimic the physiological
conditions present in an intact animal (i.e., bloodbrain barrier, drug metabolism), and it is difﬁcult to
determine the precise in vitro concentration that
would be relevant in vivo. pet studies in both nonhuman primates and humans have shown that behaviorally-active doses of cocaine are associated with high
levels of dat occupancy in the striatum (rothman
et al., 1992; volkow et al., 1996; 1997; votaw et al.,
2002; wilcox et al., 2002). in addition, human cocaine
abusers given various doses of cocaine reported subjective feelings of ‘‘high’’ that were correlated with
levels of dat occupancy in the striatum (volkow
et al., 1997). cocaine and other dat inhibitors have
also been found to increase extracellular da measured with in vivo microdialysis (czoty et al., 2000,
2002; hernandez et al., 1991; woodward et al., 1995).
the latter technique provides an effective means to
measure direct, drug-induced changes in extracellular
da associated with different levels of dat occupancy.
similar to cocaine, other local anesthetics have been
found to maintain self-administration under ﬁxedratio and progressive-ratio schedules of reinforcement in rhesus monkeys (ford and balster, 1977;
johanson, 1980; wilcox et al., 2001; woolverton, 1995;
woolverton and balster, 1979, 1982). local anesthetics
have also been shown to bind to the dat and inhibit
the uptake of da in both rodent and rhesus monkey
brain tissue (izenwasser et al., 1994; ritz et al., 1987;
wilcox et al., 1999, 2000; woodward et al., 1995).
in addition, these compounds increased extracellular
da in vivo in rodents (hernandez et al., 1991; woodward et al., 1995). interestingly, the potency order
of local anesthetics in self-administration was similar
to their afﬁnity order for dat binding and their
potency order to inhibit da uptake in rat and rhesus
monkey brain (ritz et al., 1987; wilcox et al., 1999,
2000; woodward et al., 1995). moreover, cocainedependent human subjects have reported that the
subjective effects of a high dose of procaine were similar to cocaine (adinoff et al., 1998). in another study,
three out of four normal adult volunteers identiﬁed a
high dose of i.v. procaine as cocaine, whereas i.v. lidocaine was identiﬁed as placebo (fischman et al.,
1983a,b).
the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the
relationship between the reinforcing and dat effects of

221

cocaine and the local anesthetics, dimethocaine, and
procaine, in rhesus monkeys using in vivo techniques.
the local anesthetics were selected based on their similar pharmacokinetic proﬁle (short-acting), therefore
minimizing duration of action considerations with
regard to drug differences. potency and afﬁnity of
dimethocaine is similar to cocaine, whereas potency
and afﬁnity of procaine is approximately tenfold less.
additionally, procaine is a less effective positive reinforcer when evaluated under a progressive-ratio procedure (wilcox et al., 2000; woolverton, 1995). for the
current study, reinforcing effects were determined
under a second-order procedure. dat occupancy in the
striatum determined with pet neuroimaging was
measured at doses of the local anesthetics that maintained maximum response rates during self-administration. finally, drug-induced increases in extracellular
da in the caudate nucleus were determined with in
vivo microdialysis in awake monkeys as described previously (czoty et al., 2000, 2002).
materials and methods
self-administration
animals
three adult male rhesus monkeys (rlm-1, rsu-3
and rdp-3) weighing between 9.5 and 15.0 kg were
used in these experiments. monkeys had histories of
cocaine self-administration (wilcox et al., 2002). each
subject was housed individually in a stainless steel
cage. the monkeys were fed purina monkey chow,
fruits, and vegetables to maintain stable body weights,
and water was continuously available.
surgery
a silicone catheter (0.65 mm id, 1.75 mm od;
access technologies, skokie, il) was surgically implanted into an external jugular or femoral vein. preoperative antibiotics (rocephin, 25 mg/kg or cefazolin, 25 mg/kg) were given the day of surgery to help
prevent infection. the catheter was implanted under
a combination of telazol (4.0 mg/kg) and isoﬂurane
anesthesia, using aseptic techniques. the distal end
of the catheter was routed under the skin and
attached to a subcutaneous vascular access port
(access technologies, skokie, il) located in the center
of the lower back. after surgery, the monkey was
returned to its home cage, and received banamine
(1.0 mg/kg) every 6 h for 24 h postoperatively to
reduce pain and discomfort associated with surgery.
catheters were ﬂushed daily with 100 units/ml heparinized saline to maintain patency.
apparatus
at the time of testing, each monkey was seated in a
commercially available primate chair (primate prod-

222

k.m. wilcox et al.

ucts, inc., miami, fl). a response panel with one
lever was mounted on the front of the chair. located
above the lever, in the center of the response panel,
were red and white stimulus lights. once the monkey
was seated in the chair, a huber needle (access technologies, skokie, il) was inserted into the access port.
the design of the needle minimizes damage to the
port membrane and allows for repeated punctures
over a year or more. the polyvinyl-chloride tubing
attached to the huber needle was connected to a
motor-driven syringe (coulbourn instruments, allentown, pa) located outside of the chamber containing
the drug solution. a volume of 2.0 ml/infusion was
delivered over 7 s. during testing, the chaired animal
was placed in a ventilated, sound attenuating chamber, and daily sessions lasted for approximately 1 h.
ibm compatible computers controlled experimental
events and recorded data.
procedure
animals responded for i.v. infusions of cocaine
under a second-order schedule of reinforcement. the
training dose was 0.10 mg/kg/infusion for monkeys
rlm-1 and rsu-3. the training dose was increased to
0.30 mg/kg/infusion in monkey rdp-3, since responding for 0.10 mg/kg/infusion cocaine was not stable.
when the daily self-administration session began, the
red light on the response panel was illuminated and
responding resulted in the delivery of a drug infusion
and brief illumination of the white light. initially, the
ﬁxed ratio was one (fr 1) and gradually increased to
fr 20. ultimately, a second-order schedule of reinforcement was in effect, with the ﬁrst fr 20 completed after 10 min (ﬁxed-interval, fi 10) resulting in
a drug infusion. fr 20 components completed within
the 10-min fi resulted in the illumination of the
white light for 2 s [fi 10 (fr 20:s)]. there was a 30-s
limited hold for completion of the ﬁrst fr 20 after the
fi 10 had elapsed, and a drug infusion was not delivered if the limited hold expired. drug infusions were
signaled by a change in the lights from red to white
for 15 s. following each drug infusion, there was a
one-min timeout during which responding on the
lever had no programmed consequences. a total of
ﬁve infusions could be delivered over a daily session.
the training sequence remained in effect until
responding for cocaine was stable (mean of the last 5
days with no more than 20% variation), after which
saline was substituted for cocaine until responding
decreased to below 30% of responding for the training
dose of cocaine. after saline extinction, various doses
of dimethocaine (0.030–1.7 mg/kg/infusion) and procaine (0.10–10 mg/kg/infusion) were evaluated under
the second-order schedule until responding was stable. each dose was tested once in each subject. studies were conducted monday through friday.

data analysis
response rates (responses/s) for an individual monkey were analyzed as a function of dose for each drug.
the maximum self-administered dose of each drug
was determined based on the peak of the doseresponse function for each monkey (i.e., the dose that
maintained the maximum rate of responding).

dat occupancy
animals
the same three monkeys used for the self-administration studies were used for the dat occupancy studies. the neuroimaging studies with dimethocaine and
procaine were conducted during the same period that
the drugs were being tested in the self-administration
study.
surgery
subjects were prepared with an indwelling venous
catheter connected to a vascular access port as described for self-administration experiments.
apparatus
all pet data were collected on a siemens 951 scanner. the ﬁeld of view was 10.5 cm, with intrinsic isotropic resolution of 6 mm full width at half maximum.
the data were decay corrected to time of 8-(2-[18f]
ﬂuroethyl)2b-carbomethoxy-3b-(4-chlorophenyl)nortropane ([18f]fecnt) injection, and also corrected for
randoms and scanner dead-time. a set of ge-68 ring
sources were used for attenuation correction prior to
injection of [18f]fecnt. all images were reconstructed with measured attenuation correction, zoom
factor 8, and shepp-logan reconstruction ﬁlter cut off
at 1 cycle/cm. this produced images with an in-plane
pixel size of 1.17 mm and 8 mm resolution. the axial
slice thickness was 3.375 mm.
procedure
on the days of the pet studies, monkeys were
anesthetized in the home cage with telazol (4.0 mg/
kg) and transported to the emory university pet
center. subsequently, animals were intubated and
anesthesia was maintained by isoﬂurane. animals
were positioned in the tomograph and a 15-min transmission scan was obtained for attenuation correction.
one and a half hours after isoﬂurane anesthesia
began, a slow bolus of approximately 5.0 mci [18f]
fecnt (speciﬁc activity ¼ 1.5 ci/lmole) was injected
over 5–6 min at a rate of 1.0 ml/min. data were collected over a period of 4 h, with a (45 or 53) time
frame sequence starting when [18f]fecnt was
injected. within the ﬁrst two hours, [18f]fecnt was
at or near quasi-equilibrium, after which dimetho-

caine or procaine was injected. the dose of dimethocaine or procaine that maintained maximum response
rates was administered as an i.v. bolus of the total
dose (dose in mg/kg/infusion * number of infusions)
the animal received during its self-administration session. dat occupancy was determined by displacement
of [18f]fecnt binding during the 30-min period postdrug injection.
data analysis
regions of interest were manually drawn over the
striatum and cerebellum on the frames where these
structures showed most clearly. they were then transferred to all frames to obtain time-activity curves
decay corrected to time of [18f]fecnt injection.
a generalized reference tissue method was used to
analyze the data (votaw et al., 2002). data were collected in two sections, with the assumption that drug
infusion changed only the k3 (bmaxkon) rate constant
(i.e., drugs compete with fecnt for binding the dat
and decrease the apparent bmax). five rate constants
(r, k2, k3a, k3b, and k4) and the time-activity curve
from the reference region were used to model the
putamen time-activity curve. in the modeling, it was
assumed that the competing ligand did not affect the
blood brain barrier parameters (ﬂow or extraction; r
or k2) or the transporter-fecnt kinetic properties
(kon, koff ¼ k4). thus, these parameters were kept
constant over the entire experiment. a best ﬁt (leastsquares sense) set of parameters was determined.
the off rate was constrained to ﬁt within a factor of 2
of the value determined by b-cit drug chase experiments (goodman et al., 2000). after optimization, the
covariance matrix was numerically determined and
used to estimate the uncertainty in the ﬁt values.
from this, it was found that the variance in the k3/k4
ratio is much less than the variance in either parameter alone due to their nonvanishing covariance.
because of this, the k3/k4 ratio was taken as the
measure of dat density. the fraction of transporters
occupied by the competing ligand was then estimated
as 1  (k3b/k4)/(k3a/k4).

in vivo microdialysis
animals
a separate group of three adult female rhesus monkeys (rbp-3, rjj-7, and rju-7) weighing between 7.1
and 8.8 kg, was used in dialysis experiments. monkey
rbp-3 had a history of cocaine self-administration
(lindsey et al., 2004). monkeys were individually
housed in stainless steel cages. the animals were fed
purina monkey chow, fruits, and vegetables to maintain stable body weights, and water was continuously
available.

223

surgery
subjects were prepared with an indwelling venous
catheter connected to a vascular access port as described for self-administration experiments. magnetic
resonance imaging (mri) was used to determine coordinates for intracranial cannulae implantation. t1weighted images of the entire brain were acquired
on a 1.5 tesla philips nt scanner (philips medical
systems, the netherlands). guide cannulae were implanted bilaterally into the caudate nucleus under
sterile conditions. preoperative antibiotics (rocephin,
25 mg/kg) were given the day of surgery to help prevent infection. the animals were sedated with telazol
(4.0 mg/kg) and maintained on isoﬂurane anesthesia
during the surgery. the monkey was positioned in a
stereotaxic frame, and coordinates were derived from
the monkey’s own mri. a drill was used to make a
small burr hole directly above caudate nucleus, and
cma/11 guide cannulae (cma/microdialysis, north
chelmsford, ma) were inserted to the appropriate
depth. teﬂon and titanium screws attached to the
skull were used to anchor cranioplastic cement and
support the guide cannulae. recording chambers with
caps (crist instruments, hagerstown, md) were
placed around the guide cannulae and anchored to
the skull with the cranioplastic cement to prevent the
animals from damaging the implant site. subsequently, the skin around the implant site was sutured
closed. two stainless steel stylets were placed in the
guide cannulae when they were not in use. monkeys
were allowed to recover from surgery for a minimum
of 2 weeks before initiating microdialysis experiments. all animals received banamine (1.0 mg/kg)
every 6 h for 24 h postoperatively, or longer if they
exhibited signs of discomfort.
apparatus
at the time of testing, each monkey was seated in a
commercially available primate chair (primate products, inc., miami, fl). daily sessions lasted for
approximately 3 h and were conducted within a ventilated, sound-attenuating chamber. the chair limited
movement of the animals and facilitated connections
between the implanted probes and appropriate perfusion equipment. a lexan plate positioned perpendicular to the medial plane of the body just above
shoulder height ensured that animals could not contact the probe area.
procedure
previous studies have validated the use of microdialysis in awake nonhuman primates using repeated
sampling of the same anatomical site to characterize
orderly changes in extracellular da following administration of dat inhibitors (czoty et al., 2000, 2002).
the same procedures were used in the present study.

k.m. wilcox et al.

a cma/11 dialysis probe with a 4-mm active dialysis
membrane previously ﬂushed with artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid (acsf; na2hpo4, 1.0 mm; nacl, 150
mm; kcl, 3 mm;  xxxg2125xxx , 1.3 mm; mgcl, 1.0 mm; and
 xxxd228xxx , 0.15 mm) was inserted into the guide
cannula. the probe was attached via fep teﬂon tubing to a microinjection pump (cma/102) located outside the chamber, which continuously delivered acsf
to the probe for perfusion at a ﬂow rate of 2.0 ll/min.
during a two-hour equilibrium period, animals sat in
the chamber and repeated 10-min samples were
obtained. subsequently, the unit dose of cocaine,
dimethocaine, or procaine that maintained maximum
response rates in self-administration experiments was
administered to determine percent increase in extracellular da in the presence of each drug. the drugs
were administered i.v., and 10-min samples were collected over a one-hour period. to ensure that lack of
an increase in extracellular da was not due to failure
of the analytical probe, prior to removing the probe
from the guide cannula, it was perfused with acsf
containing a higher potassium concentration (54 mm)
to induce voltage-dependent da release. microbore
high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) and
electrochemical detection quantiﬁed extracellular levels of da according to well-established analytical procedures (church et al., 1987; parsons and justice,
1993; skirboll et al., 1990).
data analysis
da levels were recorded as nanomolar concentration in dialysate unadjusted for probe recovery. mean
basal da concentration was the average of the last
three 10-min samples during the 2-h equilibrium
period. percent increase in extracellular da relative
to basal da levels was calculated as (increase in
extracellular da in the presence of drug/basal level of
da) * 100 for each drug.
drugs
cocaine hcl was obtained from the national institute on drug abuse. dimethocaine hcl was a generous gift from dr. peter silverman. procaine hcl was
purchased from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo). all
drugs were dissolved in 0.9% saline. drug doses were
calculated from the salt.

tained by saline decreased to 30% of responding maintained by the training dose of cocaine within 5–12 sessions. when dimethocaine was substituted for the
training dose of cocaine, at least three doses maintained self-administration above saline extinction levels
in all monkeys tested (figure 1). in one monkey (rsu3), the dose-response function for dimethocaine was
inverted u-shaped. although an inverted u-shaped
dose response function was not observed in the remaining two monkeys (rlm-1 and rdp-3), higher doses
were not tested out of concern for the health of the animals. when procaine was substituted for the training
dose of cocaine, only one dose maintained self-administration above saline extinction levels in one monkey
(rlm-1, figure 1). the dose-response function for procaine was inverted u-shaped in two of the monkeys
tested (rlm-1 and rsu-3). procaine was less potent for
its reinforcing effects than dimethocaine in all monkeys
tested.
dat occupancy
drug doses that maintained maximum response
rates were administered as an i.v. bolus of the total
dose individual animals received during their selfadministration sessions. dat occupancy for the maximum self-administered dose of dimethocaine (1.0 mg/
kg/infusion for monkeys rlm-1 and rsu-3, and 1.7
mg/kg/infusion for monkey rdp-3) was consistent
across monkeys and ranged from 66 to 82% (table i).
dat occupancy for the baseline dose of cocaine was
similar to that for the maximum self-administered
doses of dimethocaine and ranged from 65 to 76%
(table i; wilcox et al., 2002). relative to dimethocaine
and cocaine, dat occupancy was lower for the dose of
procaine (3.0 mg/kg/infusion) that maintained maximum rates of responding in all three monkeys tested.
dat occupancy was below the limit of detection
(<10%) in monkey rdp-3, and ranged from 33 to 41%
in the remaining two monkeys (table i).
in vivo microdialysis
administration of the dimethocaine resulted in the
greatest increase in extracellular da over baseline

levels, followed by cocaine then procaine in all three
monkeys tested (figure 2). the peak effect for
increases in extracellular da occurred within 10–
20 min post injection for all three drugs, and
returned to baseline levels within an hour after
injection (figure 2). the large variability shown at
the ﬁrst time point (10 min) was associated with different onset to peak effects in individual subjects.
the average maximum increase in extracellular da
was 186 6 32, 239 6 55, and 135 6 25 for cocaine,
dimethocaine, and procaine, respectively. importantly,
there was a close correspondence between peak increases in extracellular da determined with in vivo
microdialysis and dat occupancy determined with
pet neuroimaging (table ii). administration of cocaine
and dimethocaine resulted in high levels of dat occupancy (70–75%) and induced robust elevations in extracellular da. in contrast, administration of procaine
was associated with lower levels of dat occupancy
(28%) and was relatively ineffective in elevating extracellular da.

discussion
the purpose of the present study was to use in vivo
techniques to evaluate further the relationship
between the reinforcing and dat effects of local anesthetics. actions at the dat are an important neurochemical component mediating the behavioral effects
of cocaine, including its high abuse liability. the local
anesthetics, dimethocaine and procaine, were selected
based on their pharmacokinetic, reinforcing, and neurochemical proﬁles. substitution with dimethocaine
for the training dose of cocaine maintained selfadministration in all three monkeys tested under the
second order paradigm. in contrast, procaine maintained self-administration at a single dose in only one
monkey. clearly, procaine was a less effective reinforcer than dimethocaine even at higher unit doses.
the results of the present study are consistent with
previous ﬁndings in rhesus monkeys under ﬁxed-ratio
(woolverton and balster, 1979, 1982) and progressiveratio (wilcox et al., 2000; woolverton, 1995) selfadministration procedures. also, the cocaine-like dis-

1995) are consistent with their reinforcing proﬁles in
the current study.
pet neuroimaging was used to evaluate dat occupancy at doses of dimethocaine and procaine that
maintained maximum rates of responding. previous
pet neuroimaging studies in human cocaine abusers
found dat occupancy was between 60 and 77% for
i.v. cocaine within a range of doses commonly abused
by humans (volkow et al., 1997), consistent with
that found for displacement of [11c]cocaine in
baboons (volkow et al., 1996) and for displacement of
[18f]fecnt in rhesus monkeys (wilcox et al., 2002).
in the present study, dat occupancy was determined
by the displacement of the high afﬁnity dat ligand
[18f]fecnt, which has been validated for use as a
pet ligand to label the dat (goodman et al., 2000;

lindsey et al., 2004). a recent study has shown that
the maximum reinforcing doses of cocaine, determined using a second-order procedure, displaced between 65 and 76% of [18f]fecnt bound to the dat
in rhesus monkeys (wilcox et al., 2002). in the
present study, dat occupancy at doses of dimethocaine that maintained maximum rates of responding
was between 66 and 82%, similar to that reported
for cocaine (wilcox et al., 2002). in contrast, doses of
procaine that maintained maximum rates of
responding displaced less [18f]fecnt from the dat
(<10–41% displacement). interestingly, procaine did
maintain self-administration at one dose in one subject, and the dat occupancy observed was 41%.
although 41% occupancy is below values typically
reported for reinforcing doses of dat inhibitors, this
was the highest level of dat occupancy observed for
procaine in the present study. overall, the dat occupancy data are consistent with the drug self-admin-

reinforcing effects of local anesthetics

istration data, and therefore indicate that dat occupancy is an important variable to consider with
regard to the reinforcing effects of dat inhibitors.
in vivo microdialysis was used to evaluate elevations in extracellular da at the maximum reinforcing
doses of cocaine, dimethocaine, and procaine. previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of
using repeated-measures design in awake monkeys to
evaluate increases in extracellular da after drug
administration (czoty et al., 2000, 2002), consistent
with the ﬁndings of others (davis et al., 1997; tang
and aigner, 1996). administration of either cocaine or
dimethocaine produced robust increases in extracellular da. in contrast, procaine was relatively ineffective
in increasing extracellular da. similar ﬁndings have
been reported in rodents (hernandez et al., 1991;
woodward et al., 1995). for the local anesthetics evaluated in the present study, there was a close correspondence between dat occupancy and drug-induced
increases in extracellular da. importantly, this relationship extended to the self-administration proﬁles
of cocaine, dimethocaine, and procaine.
it is important to consider procedural differences
in drug dosing for drug self-administration, pet
neuroimaging, and in vivo microdialysis experiments. in drug self-administration experiments, subjects received ﬁve injections of the unit drug dose in
daily sessions lasting approximately 1 h. doses
selected for subsequent experiments were based on
those that maintained maximum rates of responding
in individual subjects. in pet neuroimaging experiments, dat occupancy measures were based on the
total dose administered during self-administration
sessions, and were derived over a 30-min period
postdrug injection. hence, the dat occupancy measures reported likely overestimated expected occupancy at the unit drug doses. however, they do provide an approximate measure of dat occupancy
expected at the completion of self-administration sessions after subjects received all drug injections. in
microdialysis experiments, subjects received a single
injection of the unit drug dose, and data were
obtained over a 50-min period postdrug injection.
hence the drug-induced increases in da reported
likely underestimated da levels associated with
dat occupancy measures. however, note that comparisons across drugs for in vivo dat effects used
similar dose ratios based on their behavioral effects.
hence a close association was observed for dat occupancy, drug-induced increases in extracellular da,
and reinforcing effectiveness.
given that a primary mechanism of action for local
anesthetics is the blockade of sodium channels, the
possible contribution of these effects to their behavioral and neurochemical proﬁles deserves mention. a
previous study in rhesus monkeys reported that
afﬁnity at the dat, but not the sodium channel, was

227

related to potency as a reinforcer for a series of local
anesthetics, including cocaine, dimethocaine, and
procaine (wilcox et al., 1999). additionally, what
appears to be important is the degree of separation
between afﬁnity at the dat and afﬁnity at the
sodium channel (wilcox et al., 1999). both cocaine
and dimethocaine have higher afﬁnity at the dat
and a greater separation between their afﬁnities at
the dat and the sodium channel, compared with
procaine. the differences between the drugs for their
reinforcing and dopaminergic effects observed in the
present study may be attributed to the relationship
between their dat and sodium channel afﬁnities.
studies evaluating the behavioral and neurochemical effects of the local anesthetics tetracaine and
piperocaine support the notion of a mutual inﬂuence
of the dat and the sodium channel on the reinforcing effects of local anesthetics. tetracaine binds to
the dat with an afﬁnity comparable to cocaine; however, the afﬁnity of tetracaine at the sodium channel
is 10 times greater than the afﬁnity of cocaine (wilcox et al., 1999). despite tetracaine’s high afﬁnity at
the dat, it does not consistently maintain selfadministration under ﬁxed-ratio or progressive-ratio
procedures (wilcox et al., 2000; woolverton and balster, 1979). similar to tetracaine, piperocaine has
high afﬁnity at both the dat and the sodium channel and does not maintain self-administration in
monkeys (woolverton and balster, 1982). there is
suggestion that the abuse liability of local anesthetics would be comparable to cocaine if toxicity
(e.g., seizures), most likely mediated by sodium
channel effects, was not a concern (see wilcox et al.,
2000). in the present study, procaine dose was limited out of concern for the health of the animals. it is
possible that if higher procaine doses were tested,
the behavioral and neurochemical proﬁle of procaine
would have been comparable to cocaine and dimethocaine.
in summary, using in vivo techniques was reliable
for evaluating the reinforcing and dat effects of several local anesthetics. in addition, dat effects determined in the present study using in vivo techniques
were consistent with afﬁnity at the dat and potency
to inhibit da uptake for local anesthetics determined
with well-established in vitro techniques (ritz et al.,
1987; wilcox et al., 1999, 2000; woodward et al.,
1995). the current in vivo approach offers the advantage of repeated measures within subjects designs that
are well-suited for multiple dependent variables and
longitudinal studies. importantly, percent dat occupancy and the resulting increases in extracellular da
were consistent with the reinforcing effects for
cocaine, dimethocaine, and procaine. these data further support a critical role for the dat in the reinforcing effects and associated abuse liability of local
anesthetics.
