the antidiabetic thiazolidinediones, which include
troglitazone and rosiglitazone, are ligands for the
nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor (ppar)- and exert their antihyperglycemic
effects by regulation of ppar- –responsive genes. we
report here that ppar- activation by troglitazone
depends on the experimental setting. troglitazone acts
as a partial agonist for ppar- in transfected muscle
(c2c12) and kidney (hek 293t) cells, producing a submaximal transcriptional response (1.8- to 2.5-fold activation) compared with rosiglitazone (7.4- to 13-fold
activation). additionally, troglitazone antagonizes
rosiglitazone-stimulated ppar- transcriptional activity.
limited protease digestion of ppar- suggests conformational differences in the receptor bound to troglitazone versus rosiglitazone. consistent with this finding,
an in vitro coactivator association assay demonstrated
that troglitazone-bound ppar- recruited the transcriptional coactivators p300 and  xxxg1510xxx  less efficiently than rosiglitazone-bound receptor.
in contrast to these observations, troglitazone behaves
as a full agonist of ppar- in 3t3l1 adipocytes. twodimensional protein gel electrophoresis demonstrated
that troglitazone and rosiglitazone regulated distinct but
overlapping sets of genes in several cell types. thus,
troglitazone may behave as a partial agonist under certain physiological circumstances and as a full agonist in
others. these differences could be caused by variations
in the amount of specific cofactors, differences in ppar
response elements, or the presence of different isoforms of ppar- . diabetes 49:539–547, 2000

t

ype 2 diabetes is characterized by decreased
insulin sensitivity of peripheral tissues. glucose
homeostasis is maintained under these circumstances by increased insulin secretion from pancreatic -cells. in some cases, the -cell is unable to maintain
increased output. the antidiabetic thiazolidinediones (tzds),
such as troglitazone, improve peripheral insulin sensitivity,
leading to reduced blood glucose and insulin levels and the
preservation of pancreatic function (1–4). improvement of
insulin sensitivity by tzds is most likely due to the activation
of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar)(5). the tzds are high-affinity ligands for ppar- in vitro, and
the rank order of receptor affinity correlates with their in vivo
hypoglycemic activity (6), with one reported exception (7).
although many of the molecular details are not clearly understood, a model has emerged in which activated ppar- modulates the transcriptional activity of a set of genes encoding
proteins that are important in glucose and lipid metabolism.
however, the identity of these genes and the precise pathways
leading to the normalization of insulin sensitivity remain
largely unknown.
recently, the x-ray crystal structure of the ligand-binding
domain of ppar- has been elucidated (3,8), revealing that
ligand binding causes a conformational change within
ppar- such that the receptor is converted to an “activated
mode” that promotes the recruitment of coactivators such as
 xxxg1510xxx  ( xxxg1510xxx ) and p300. it has been
postulated that these coactivators act as bridges to transmit
the nuclear receptor regulatory signals to the cellular
transcriptional machinery. studies on estrogen and progesterone receptors have suggested that a range of distinct receptor conformations can be induced by the binding of different
ligands (9–13). although less is known about ppar- in this
regard, it is possible that different ppar- ligands induce
unique conformational changes in the receptor, eliciting distinct downstream biological effects. we have compared troglitazone to other tzds in terms of its ability to activate
ppar- 1 in several different experimental paradigms, including transcriptional activation, coactivator binding, and receptor conformation. we report here that in certain situations,
troglitazone behaves as a partial agonist of the receptor.
research design and methods
chemicals. troglitazone and  xxxd3147xxx  (rosiglitazone) were synthesized at
parke-davis pharmaceutical research division of warner-lambert (ann arbor,
539

troglitazone is apartialagonist for ppar- 1

mi). trypsin, insulin, dexamethasone, and isobutylmethylxanthin were purchased
from sigma chemical (st. louis, mo).
transient reporter assays. the chimeric receptor plasmid ptet-mppar- -lbd
was constructed by fusing the ligand binding domain of mouse (m) ppar- 1
(amino acids 175–476) to the dna binding domain of the escherichia coli tetracycline (tet) repressor (amino acids 1–214). the luciferase reporter plasmid
pltetp is composed of a hindiii-xhoi fragment from the plasmid ptet-ttak (life
technologies, gaithersburg, md) (which contains the tet repressor binding site
embedded in a minimal cytomegalovirus [cmv] promoter), inserted upstream of
the luciferase coding region in the plasmid  xxxg2041xxx -basic (promega, madison, wi).
transfection of the human kidney epithelial cell line 293t was carried out by electroporation using the cell porator system from life technologies according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. after transfection, cells were plated onto 96-well
plates and treated immediately with ligand as indicated.
the reporter construct used in the native ppar response element (ppre)
reporter assay (are6.3xtkpgl3) contained three copies of the ppre site
(are6) from the ap2 enhancer (14) inserted upstream of the minimal thymidine
kinase (tk) promoter in the  xxxg2041xxx  luciferase vector (promega). c2c12 cells were
grown in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (fbs), plated into 24-well plates at 50% confluence, and transfected with expression plasmids encoding mouse ppar- 1 (200 ng), mouse
rxr- (50 ng), the are6.3xtkpgl3 (200 ng), and the internal reference plasmid
pcmv -galactosidase (50 ng) using lipofectamine (life technologies). after
transfection, cells were treated for 48 h with appropriate ligands and then harvested. luciferase and -galactosidase activities were determined using the duallight luciferase and -galactosidase reporter gene assay system (tropix, bedford,
ma). for 3t3-l1 adipocytes, cells were first differentiated into adipocytes as
described (15). approximately 1 107 cells were transfected with the reporter
plasmid are6.3xtkpgl3 (100 µg) and the pcmv -galactosidase (50 µg) using
the gene pulser ii system (bio-rad laboratories, hercules, ca) at 960 µf and
160 v. transfected cells were replated into 24-well plates and treated with appropriate ligands for 36 h and then harvested. in all transfection assays, the expression of pcmv -galactosidase plasmid was used as an internal control for the normalization of transfection efficiency.
in vitro coactivator binding assay. the cooh-terminal portion of human
ppar- 1 (amino acids 175–476) containing the ligand binding domain (lbd)
was fused to the  xxxg1073xxx  (gst) coding region in the plasmid
pgex-5x (amersham pharmacia biotech, uppsala, sweden). the resulting gstppar- lbd fusion protein was expressed in e. coli, isolated, and partially purified using glutathione agarose. full-length human  xxxg1510xxx , or the amino-terminal
portion of p300 (amino acids 1–443), was labeled with [35s]methionine in a coupled in vitro transcription and translation system (promega). the coactivator binding assay was carried out essentially as described by cheng et al. (16). briefly, 3–5 µl
[35s]methionine-labeled p300 or  xxxg1510xxx  was incubated with the immobilized gstppar- lbd in gst binding buffer (50 mmol/l kcl, 20 mmol/l hepes, ph 7.9,
2 mmol/l edta, 0.1% nonidet p-40, 10% glycerol, 0.5% nonfat dry milk, 5 mmol/l
dithiothreitol [dtt], and protease inhibitors) together with ligands as indicated.
the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4°c with gentle rocking. the beads were
washed four times with 1 ml gst binding buffer containing 150 mmol/l nacl. the
bound proteins were eluted in 20 µl of 2 sds loading buffer, run on a 10% sdspolyacrylamide gel, and visualized by autoradiography. the amount of
[35s]methionine-labeled p300 or  xxxg1510xxx  was quantified by phosphor-image analysis using imagequant software (molecular dynamics, sunnyvale, ca).
limited protease sensitivity assay. approximately 5 µl of in vitro synthesized [35s]methionine-labeled, full-length mouse ppar- 1 was preincubated with
1 mmol/l rosiglitazone or 1 mmol/l troglitazone in 25 mmol/l kcl, 10 mmol/l trishcl, ph 8.0, and 10 mmol/l dtt for 15 min. trypsin was added to a final concentration of 10 µg/ml and incubated for 15, 30, 60, 120, and 150 min. the reaction was
terminated by adding 2 sds sample loading buffer and resolved in 12% sds-polyacrylamide gel. labeled ppar- was visualized by phosphor-image analysis.
analysis of rna. total cellular rna was isolated from 3t3-l1 adipocytes using
the ultraspec rna isolation system (biotecx laboratories, houston, tx). northern blot analysis was performed on ~15 µg of total rna with purified mouse ap2
and rat -actin probes as described previously (17). rnase protection assays were
performed using the rpa ii ribonuclease protection assay kit (ambion, austin,
tx). the antisense [ -32p]utp-labeled single-stranded rna probe for  xxxg347xxx –associated protein (cap) mrna has been described previously (18).
two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. huvec (human umbilical vein) cells
were purchased from biowhittaker (walkersville, md) and maintained as recommended by the manufacturer. hepg2 (human hepatic) cells were cultured in
minimal essential medium containing 10% fbs. cv-1 (african green monkey kidney) cells, caco2 (human colonic) cells, and 3t3-l1 (mouse) adipocytes were
maintained in dmem containing 10% fbs. u937 (human) monocytes were cultured in rpmi containing 10% fbs. cells grown in 60-mm plates were treated with
dmso, 20 µmol/l rosiglitazone, or 20 µmol/l troglitazone for 18 h at a cell density
540

of ~60–80% confluence. medium was replaced with methionine-free medium
containing the same concentrations of the drugs and 500 µci/ml of trans 35s-label
(e. coli hydrolysate labeling reagent containing 70%  xxxd2595xxx ) (icn pharmaceuticals, irvine, ca) and incubated for an additional 12 h. whole cell extracts
required for the two-dimensional (2d) gel electrophoresis system were prepared
as recommended in the millipore investigator 2d gel electrophoresis manual
(millipore, bedford, ma). 2d gels were run on the investigator system (genomic
solution, ann arbor, mi) with ph 3-10/2d ampholines in the first dimension and
10% acrylamide in the second dimension.

results

troglitazone is a partial agonist of ppar- in a
chimeric receptor transcription system. although troglitazone and rosiglitazone are identical in their efficacy regarding the lowering of plasma glucose levels in animal models of
diabetes (j.h. johnson, personal communication), other
physiological differences have been noted (19). to determine if these ligands display differential activities at the
molecular level, we compared the ability of troglitazone and
rosiglitazone to activate ppar- in different cell types and in
different promoter contexts. the activation of ppar- –
dependent transcription by troglitazone and rosiglitazone
was examined using a chimeric receptor assay. we constructed a ppar- receptor composed of the ligand binding
domain of mouse ppar- 1 fused to the bacterial tetracycline
repressor dna binding domain. a plasmid producing this
receptor (ptet-mppar- lbd) was cotransfected into 293t
cells with a reporter containing the tet repressor binding site
driving expression of the luciferase gene. transfected cells
were then treated with increasing concentrations of either
troglitazone or rosiglitazone. as shown in fig. 1a, both rosiglitazone and troglitazone caused an increase in ppar- –
dependent transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent
manner, with concentration at half-maximal stimulation
(ec50) values of 6.5 and 11.0 µmol/l, respectively. however,
troglitazone induced a submaximal response compared with
rosiglitazone (2.5- vs. 13-fold). this finding suggested that
troglitazone may be acting as a partial agonist of ppar- in
this experimental setting.
a partial agonist is defined as a ligand that induces a submaximal response even at full receptor occupancy. in addition, a partial agonist can competitively occupy the same
drug-binding site as the agonist and consequently decrease the
agonist-stimulated cellular response. to determine whether
troglitazone can compete with rosiglitazone and inhibit its
transcriptional activity, transfected 293t cells were cotreated
with 8 µmol/l rosiglitazone and increasing concentrations of
troglitazone. troglitazone caused a dose-dependent decrease
in rosiglitazone-stimulated ppar- transcriptional activity,
with a concentration at half-maximal inhibition (ic50) of
~25 µmol/l (fig. 1b). these results demonstrate that in this
system, troglitazone can competitively reduce the transcriptional activity of a full agonist. to further explore this activity, transfected 293t cells were treated with increasing concentrations of rosiglitazone in the presence or absence of
50 µmol/l troglitazone. as shown in fig. 1c, the rosiglitazone
dose-response curve was shifted to the right in the presence
of troglitazone, again indicating that troglitazone competes
with rosiglitazone and reduces its transcriptional activity.
these results suggest that in this particular experimental setting, troglitazone acts as a partial agonist.
it has been reported that the order of the ppar- binding
potencies of known tzds are rosiglitazone > pioglitazone >

troglitazone = ciglitazone (6). to determine if any of the
tzds with potencies closer to that of troglitazone behave as
partial agonists, transfected cells were treated with increasing concentrations of rosiglitazone in the presence of these
tzds. in contrast to troglitazone, the inclusion of 25 µmol/l
pioglitazone did not cause a rightward shift in the rosiglitazone dose-response curve (fig. 1d). very similar results
were observed with ciglitazone (data not shown). these
findings indicate that pioglitazone and ciglitazone are full agonists of ppar- in this system and, further, that troglitazone
is unique among this set of tzds.
troglitazone behaves as a partial agonist in a native
receptor transcription system. to determine if troglitazone
also acts as a partial agonist of the native (full-length) receptor, an experiment was carried out with vectors expressing

enhancer (are6.3xtkpgl3). c2c12 myoblasts were transfected with these plasmids and treated with tzds. troglitazone and rosiglitazone caused increases in ppar- transcriptional activity, with ec50 values of 7.6 and 3.0 µmol/l, respectively (fig. 2a). however, troglitazone induced a submaximal
transcriptional response compared with rosiglitazone (1.7- vs.
7.5-fold) (fig. 2a). similar results were obtained in hela
cells as well as with a reporter containing the entire ap2
enhancer region or ppres from pepck and malic enzyme
(data not shown).
to determine if the native receptor system behaves like the
chimeric receptor system with regard to competition by
troglitazone, transfected c2c12 cells were treated with a
constant amount of rosiglitazone (8 µmol/l) and increasing
concentrations of troglitazone. similar to the results
observed in the chimeric receptor system, troglitazone
caused a dose-dependent decrease in rosiglitazone-stimu541

lated ppar- transcriptional activity, with an ic50 of 8 µmol/l
(fig. 2b). likewise, the effect of troglitazone (3 or 30 µmol/l)
on the rosiglitazone dose-response curve was similar to that
observed in the chimeric receptor system. the addition of
3 µmol/l troglitazone caused a rightward shift of the rosiglitazone dose-response curve, while 30 µmol/l troglitazone flattened the curve almost completely (fig. 2c). at lower concentrations of rosiglitazone, the presence of 30 µmol/l troglitazone increased ppar- transcriptional activity to the level
expected for that amount of troglitazone (2.5-fold). in two different experimental settings, troglitazone acts as a partial
agonist of ppar- with respect to the induction of ppar- 1
transcriptional activity.
troglitazone and rosiglitazone induce a differential
sensitivity to limited trypsin digestion of ppar- . the
differential transcriptional responses displayed by troglitazone
and rosiglitazone could be due to differences in the receptor
conformation induced by the binding of these two ligands. to
determine if there are conformational differences in pparbound to these two drugs, a limited trypsin digestion on a full542

length in vitro translated [35s]methionine-labeled mppar- 1
was carried out in the presence or absence of saturating concentrations of rosiglitazone or troglitazone. compared with
unliganded or troglitazone-bound receptor, rosiglitazone
induced a stronger protection of the 34- and 35-kda fragments (fig. 3). troglitazone binding yielded several protected
fragments (>35 kda) that were not present in the dmso control samples and only weakly present in rosiglitazone-treated
samples. in addition, a strong 29-kda fragment detected in the
troglitazone-bound receptor was only faintly represented in
the dmso- and rosiglitazone-treated samples. these results
indicate that troglitazone-bound ppar- has a distinct
trypsin digestion pattern compared with the rosiglitazonebound receptor, presumably due to differences in receptor
conformation.
troglitazone behaves as a partial agonist in an in vitro
coactivator recruitment assay. the change in receptor
conformation induced by ligand binding causes the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators (20,21). ppar- has been
shown to interact with the coactivators  xxxg1510xxx  and p300/cbp

(22–24). to determine if the conformational differences in
troglitazone- versus rosiglitazone-bound receptor lead to differential interactions with coactivators, an in vitro gst-fusion
protein pull-down assay was performed with  xxxg1510xxx  and p300.
bacteria-expressed gst-ppar- lbd fusion protein was
incubated with in vitro translated [35s]methionine-labeled
nh2-terminal region of p300, or full-length  xxxg1510xxx , in the presence of increasing concentrations of ligands (fig. 4). both
ligands induced cofactor recruitment to ppar- in a dosedependent manner. however, the level of cofactor recruitment at maximal ligand concentrations was much lower for
troglitazone (20% of rosiglitazone-mediated binding). these
results support the hypothesis that troglitazone and rosiglitazone induce different receptor conformations and suggest
that the differential transcriptional activity of the two ligands
is due to differential recruitment of coactivators.
troglitazone behaves as a full agonist of ppar- in
3t3-l1 adipocytes. 3t3-l1 preadipocytes can be differentiated into fat droplet–containing adipocytes with appropriate hormonal treatment (25). ppar- appears to play a role
in this system, since treatment of preadipocytes with
ppar- ligands can induce differentiation, presumably by
activating endogenous ppar- (5). in this cell line, we have
found that troglitazone and rosiglitazone induce a similar
level of adipocyte conversion at maximal concentrations,
although with different ec50 values (data not shown). to
examine the behavior of these two ligands on endogenous
ppar- , the transcriptional activity of a transfected ppar- –
responsive reporter was measured in 3t3-l1 adipocytes
treated with troglitazone and rosiglitazone. preadipocytes
were converted into adipocytes by treatment with an adipogenic hormonal cocktail (15). fully differentiated adipocytes were then electroporated with the reporter plasmid
are6.3xtkpgl3 and treated with increasing concentrations
of ligands. both drugs caused a dose-dependent increase in

ppar- activity, with lower ec50 values than observed with
transfected receptors (150 nmol/l for rosiglitazone, 1 µmol/l
for troglitazone) (fig. 5a). in contrast to the experiments
described above, at maximal concentrations, troglitazone
activated transcription to the same degree as rosiglitazone.
there are several ppar- target genes expressed in 3t3-l1
adipocytes. the ap2 gene encodes an adipose-specific intracellular lipid binding protein and contains two functional
ppres in its enhancer region (are6 and are7) (14).
recently, it was shown that cap is a ppar- target gene in
adipocytes (18). to examine if these ppar- target genes
are differentially induced in response to troglitazone and
rosiglitazone, 3t3-l1 adipocytes were treated with maximal
concentrations of rosiglitazone or troglitazone for 13 or 42 h,
followed by measurement of mrna levels. as shown in
fig. 5b, treatment with either drug caused approximately
equivalent increases in ap2 mrna expression at both time
points. a similar increase of cap mrna was also produced
by both compounds. taken together, these results indicate
that in this insulin-responsive cell line, troglitazone behaves
as a full agonist of ppar- , activating ppar- target gene
expression to the same degree as rosiglitazone.

cap mrna (right panel).

troglitazone and rosiglitazone regulate distinct but
overlapping sets of genes in several cell lines. based on
the above observations, we speculated that troglitazone
behaves as a partial agonist of ppar- in some cellular circumstances and as a full agonist in others. consequently, it
seems possible that troglitazone and rosiglitazone may have
distinct downstream biological effects, perhaps by regulating
different sets of genes. as an initial step in testing this
hypothesis, using 2d protein gel electrophoresis, we indirectly examined gene expression patterns in cells treated
with ligands. changes in gene transcription will result in
altered rates of protein synthesis, which can be determined
by incorporation of labeled amino acids into specific proteins. metabolic labeling and 2d protein gel electrophoresis
were carried out using cv1, hepg2, huvec, 3t3-l1, caco2,
and u937 cells, all of which are known to express some level
of endogenous ppar- . as presented in table 1, the expression level of a number of proteins was changed by treatment
with ppar- ligands. although this method does not directly
measure transcriptional activity, troglitazone and rosiglitazone
appeared to activate or repress distinct but overlapping sets
of genes in most of these cell lines. several examples of
changes induced by troglitazone and rosiglitazone are shown
in fig. 6. two examples of coregulated genes can be seen in
gels of proteins from 3t3-l1 adipocytes, where both drugs
induced protein 46 but decreased the level of protein 66
(fig. 6a). an example of a troglitazone-specific change from
544

huvec cells is presented in fig. 6b, where the expression of
protein 13 is increased by troglitazone but not rosiglitazone.
a rosiglitazone-specific change in cv-1 cells is presented in
fig. 6c, where protein 10 is increased by rosiglitazone but not
by troglitazone. these results suggest that different pparligands may have distinct downstream effects, possibly in a
cell-specific or tissue-specific manner.

numerous studies with steroid hormone receptors suggest
that individual ligands of single receptors can have multiple
downstream biological effects depending on tissue type, cellular environment, and promoter architecture (9–13). a
good example of this phenomenon is seen with the antiestrogen tamoxifen, which functions as an antagonist in
some estrogen-mediated responses and as a partial agonist
in others (26,27). in the current study, we provide evidence
that the antidiabetic drug troglitazone can behave as a partial agonist for ppar- in certain cellular settings. in two different transfected cell systems, troglitazone induced a submaximal ppar- transcriptional response compared with the
more potent ligand rosiglitazone (figs. 1 and 2). in addition,
cotreatment of transfected cells with these ligands demonstrated that troglitazone antagonized rosiglitazone-induced
ppar- transcriptional activity. two other tzds, pioglitazone
and ciglitazone, did not show partial agonist activity in the
same experimental conditions (fig. 1d). results from in

the number of protein spots scored as “up” or “down” was based on approximately twofold changes compared with vehicle control. common, proteins whose expression was changed to the same degree by both drugs; troglitazone- and rosiglitazone-specific,
proteins whose expression was changed by one drug and unchanged by the other.

vitro coactivator binding experiments suggest that this
reduced transcriptional activity may be due to a decreased
ability of the troglitazone-bound receptor to recruit
transcriptional coactivators. these findings suggest that
troglitazone induces a conformation of the receptor distinct
from that of rosiglitazone. this interpretation was supported
by structural studies demonstrating that the two ligands
induced distinct protease digestion patterns upon receptor
occupations (fig. 3).
in contrast to its behavior in transcription systems using
exogenous (transfected) ppar- , troglitazone appeared to

behave as a full agonist when transcription was analyzed in
cells containing endogenous receptors (3t3l1 adipocytes). in
these cells, the transcription from either a transfected ppre
driven reporter or endogenous ppar- –responsive genes
was activated to a similar degree by both troglitazone and
rosiglitazone (fig. 5). these results indicate that troglitazone
may differentially activate ppar- in a manner dependent on
the cellular environment. the full agonist activity of troglitazone in 3t3l1 adipocytes may be analogous to its activity
as an antidiabetic agent in vivo, where it appears to be as efficacious as rosiglitazone.

troglitazone is apartialagonist for ppar- 1

what is the molecular basis for the different transcriptional
activities of troglitazone and rosiglitazone? one possibility is
that the two ligands cause differential cofactor recruitment.
the immediate consequence of ligand binding is a conformational change in the receptor that increases its affinity for
transcriptional coactivator proteins (20,21). many of these
coactivators are expressed ubiquitously, although a cell
type–specific coactivator has been described (28). we have
shown that two coactivators, p300 and  xxxg1510xxx , appear to have
a lower affinity for ppar- bound to troglitazone compared
with rosiglitazone. these coactivators interact with a domain
of the receptor that undergoes a conformational change upon
ligand binding (3). our findings suggest that the conformation
of this domain must be somewhat different in troglitazone- versus rosiglitazone-bound receptors. the observation that
troglitazone and rosiglitazone behave similarly in 3t3l1 cells
suggests that there may be additional coactivators in this cell
type that interact with a different domain of the receptor than
that recognized by p300 or  xxxg1510xxx . this second domain might
undergo the same conformational change upon either troglitazone or rosiglitazone binding and would therefore interact
equally well with receptors bound to either ligand. a model can
be constructed in which troglitazone behaves as a partial agonist in cell types that contain primarily coactivators such as
p300 or  xxxg1510xxx , and as a full agonist in cell types that contain
“nondiscriminating” coactivators.
another potential factor that could contribute to the differential activity of troglitazone in different cell types is the
ppar- 2 isoform. mouse ppar- 2 is derived by alternative
splicing from the same gene as ppar- 1 and contains an
additional 30 amino acids at the nh2-terminus (29,30).
ppar- 2 expression is limited to adipose tissue (31),
whereas ppar- 1 is expressed in adipose tissue, liver, muscle, macrophages, and colon (32–34). the relative contribution of the two isoforms to the antidiabetic activity of the
tzds is unknown. it is possible that the additional nh2-terminal sequence affects the action of some ligands. it has
been reported that the additional sequences of ppar- 2 contribute a ligand-independent transactivation function (35).
in addition, it has been reported that modification of the
nh2-terminal portion of ppar- 2 (by phosphorylation) can
influence ligand–receptor interactions (36). one possible
explanation of our results is that troglitazone behaves differently on these two isoforms of ppar- .
finally, it is also possible that the different transcriptional
effects of troglitazone and rosiglitazone are caused by special
circumstances that occur in cells transiently transfected with
ppar- . it is likely that in these systems, the cellular concentration of exogenously introduced receptor exceeds the
normal level of endogenous ppar- in cells such as 3t3l1
adipocytes. this may contribute to the higher ec50 values we
have observed in transiently transfected cells. the excess
amount of receptor could change characteristics of the
transcriptional apparatus in unpredictable ways that might
influence the ability of a ligand to activate the receptor. this
possibility seems less likely, since not all tzds behave as partial agonists in the same experimental setting. in addition, our
results from the coactivator binding assay and protease sensitivity assay clearly showed differential effects of troglitazone
and rosiglitazone in a noncellular in vitro setting.
the findings reported here have potential general implications with regard to the physiological actions of ppar
546

ligands. the observation that ligands can have distinct effects
on the receptor raises the possibility that different pparligands induce different sets of genes in different tissues that
in turn have distinct downstream biological effects. in this
respect, ppar- may be analogous to the steroid hormone
receptors. numerous studies on estrogen and progesterone
receptors have indicated that a range of distinct receptor
conformations can be induced by the binding of different
ligands. there is a strong correlation between receptor conformations elicited by different ligands and downstream biological activity (9–13). the hypothesis that different pparligands have distinct downstream effects is supported by our
protein profiling experiment that demonstrated differential
regulation of gene expression by troglitazone and rosiglitazone in several cell types.
