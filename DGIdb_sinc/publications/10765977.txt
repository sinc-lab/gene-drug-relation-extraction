summary several studies have shown that the activities of  xxxg758xxx  and delta-5-desaturase are
depressed in experimental diabetes and in humans with insulin- and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type i
and type ii diabetes mellitus respectively). furthermore, treatment with insulin is known to correct the defects in
desaturases in rats and humans with diabetes, especially in type i. in a recent study, we demonstrated that l-arginine
and  xxxd2738xxx  can prevent alloxan-induced b cell damage, and the severity of diabetes, and restore the antioxidant
status to near normal levels. but, no information is available as to the relationship between l-arginine- xxxd2738xxx 
system and the metabolism of essential  xxxd2154xxx  in diabetes mellitus. in the present study, it was noted that the
plasma levels of saturated  xxxd2154xxx : stearic and palmitic were increased where as unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  such as
oleic, linoleic, g-linolenic and eicosapentaenoic acids (oa, la, gla and epa respectively) were decreased in alloxaninduced diabetic rats. in the liver phospholipid (pl) fraction, gla,  xxxd1886xxx  (dihomo-gla) and a- xxxd2490xxx  (ala)
were decreased in the alloxan-treated group; in the muscle pl fraction, la, gla and  xxxd1886xxx  were low, whereas an
increase in the saturated fatty acid content was noted. l-arginine (the precursor of  xxxd2738xxx ) and sodium
nitroprusside (a  xxxd2738xxx  donor) treatment of alloxan-induced diabetic rats enhanced the levels of la, gla and  xxxd1886xxx .
further,  xxxd2738xxx  synthase inhibitor,  xxxd3291xxx , prevented this beneficial action of l-arginine- xxxd2738xxx  system on
essential fatty acid metabolism. the abnormalities in the essential fatty acid metabolism observed also reverted to
normalcy following control of diabetes with insulin. these results indicate that  xxxd2738xxx  can enhance the activities of
delta-6- and delta-5 desaturases, which are depressed in diabetes, and suggests that there is a close interaction
between l-arginine- xxxd2738xxx  system and the metabolism of essential  xxxd2154xxx . © 2000 harcourt publishers ltd

introduction
one of the major aims of treatment of diabetes mellitus
(dm) is not only to control hyperglycemia and the acute
complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis, but also to
prevent target organ damage such as nephropathy,
retinopathy, coronary heart disease (chd), neuropathy
and atherosclerosis. the exact mechanism(s) by which
these complications occur in dm is still not clear. but, it is
possible that an increase in platelet aggregation, generation of free radicals by neutrophils and macrophages with

consequent formation of oxidized low-density lipoprotein
(ox-ldl), damage to endothelial cells, lipid abnormalities
etc., are some of the factors involved in the pathogenesis
of these complications due to dm.1–3
there is now evidence that essential  xxxd2154xxx  (efas)
and their metabolites can prevent platelet aggregation,
regress or arrest atherosclerosis, modulate free-radical
generation and lipid peroxidation process, lower serum
cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and form precursors to
biologically active compounds such as  xxxd124xxx 
( xxxd124xxx ) and prostacyclin (pgi2), which have potent
platelet anti-aggregator and vasodilator actions.4–9
several studies have shown that the activities of delta6- and delta-5-desaturases (d-6-d and d-5-d respectively)
are depressed in experimental diabetes and humans with
insulin-dependent dm and non-insulin-dependent dm

(type i and type ii diabetes respectively).10–13 these
defects in d-6-d and d-5-d activities have been shown to
be corrected in rats and humans with diabetes following
insulin treatment.10–14 it has also been reported that
administration of linoleic acid (la, 18:2, n-6) and its
metabolites can block, prevent and /or reverse some of
the complications of diabetes, such as cataract, retinopathy and chd.5,15–17
the recently concluded the diabetes control and complications trial (dcct) revealed that aggressive treatment of type i diabetes aimed at restoring relative
euglycemia diminish pathology in the microvascular with
no significant reduction in the incidence of macrovascular disease.18 similar, if not identical, results have been
obtained in the ukpds study in type ii diabetes.19
increase in the formation of advanced glycation end
products (ages) due to hyperglycemia have the capacity
to suppress the expression of constitutive  xxxd2738xxx 
synthase (c-no) activity and also quench  xxxd2738xxx 
(no) thus, contributing to decreased levels of no in
patients with diabetes.20–21 based on these results, it has
been argued that this decrease in the synthesis and levels
of no may be responsible for the accelerated atherosclerosis seen in diabetes.20,22,23 in this context, it is interesting
to note that no can prevent platelet aggregation and is a
potent vasodilator.24,25 further, insulin not only can
reduce plasma glucose levels, but is also capable of
enhancing no synthesis.26 this action of insulin on no
may, at least in part, be responsible for its (insulin)
beneficial action in diabetes. in addition, insulin treatment is known to correct d-6-d and d-5-d defects in diabetes. but, no information is available as to the interaction
between no and efa metabolism. in the present study,
we present evidence which suggests that l-arginine-no
system can restore the d-6-d and d-5-d activities to near
normalcy in alloxan-induced diabetes mellitus.
materials and methods
male wistar rats, 4–5 weeks old, were used in the present
study.
sources of chemicals
all the fine chemicals used in the present study were
obtained from sigma chemical company, st. louis, mo,
usa.
induction of diabetes mellitus
alloxan was used to induce type i diabetes (insulindependent dm) as described before.27 the experimental
and control animals were kept fasting for 12 h prior to the
administration of alloxan. freshly prepared alloxan in

50 mm citrate buffer, ph 3.0, was injected intraperitoneally into these animals at a dose of 75 mg/kg of body
weight for 5 consecutive days. both blood sugar and
urine sugar was estimated in these animals once in 3 or 4
days, after the last dose of alloxan, by glucometer to
confirm the development of diabetes. usually, these animals developed type i diabetes mellitus in about 2–3
weeks time after the first injection of alloxan. these animals showed weight loss (due to uncontrolled diabetes
mellitus), severe hyperglycemia (fasting blood sugar
> 275 mg%), and a clear decline in plasma insulin. to
determine the role of l-arginine- xxxd2738xxx  system in the
development of diabetes and efa metabolism, one group
(n = 10) of animals received 24 h prior to alloxan treatment 50 mg of l-arginine, the precursor of no, in 0.5 ml
of normal saline intraperitoneally. for next 5 days these
animals received alloxan as usual. this group is called the
pre-arginine group.
to another group of 10 animals, simultaneous
intraperitoneal injections of 50 mg of l-arginine in 0.5 ml
of normal saline and alloxan in 0.5 ml of 50 mm citrate
buffer ph 3.0 was given for 5 consecutive days. this
group is called as the simultaneous l-arginine and
alloxan group.
to determine whether inhibition of nos will have any
effect on the development of type i diabetes mellitus and
efa metabolism, one group of 10 animals received
intraperitoneally, freshly prepared  xxxd3291xxx  (20 mg/kg), a
specific no synthesis inhibitor, in 0.5 ml of normal saline,
and 50 mg of l-arginine simultaneously 24 h prior to
alloxan treatment. in addition, another group of 10
animals received intraperitoneally  xxxd3291xxx  (20 mg/kg),
50 mg of l-arginine and alloxan at the same time per day
for 5 consecutive days. as a control, another group of
10 animals received  xxxd3291xxx  and alloxan intraperitoneally at the same time for 5 consecutive days.
in a similar fashion, the no donor, sodium nitroprusside, was also used in these studies. similar to  xxxd3291xxx 
and l-arginine, sodium nitroprusside was administered to
the respective groups of animals 24 h prior to alloxan
treatment and simultaneously with alloxan for 5 consecutive days. for all these studies, appropriate controls were
also used. details of the experimental protocol used in the
present study is given in scheme 1.
insulin treatment
for the control of hyperglycemia, subcutaneous injections of intermediate acting zinc insulin (in the form of
human monotard®, novo nordisk, india) was administered at a dose of 4 units twice a day (at 08.00 and
16.00 hours). as a result of this insulin injection, the fasting blood sugar that was around 275 mg/dl dropped to
less than 120 mg/dl in these animals. hyperglycemia in

this group of animals was thus controlled by insulin for a
minimum period of 8 days and were killed on day 9 for
further studies.

acid pattern observed in the control and alloxantreatments for different sets of experiments were not
identical but, the changes observed in these controls were
only minor and were not statistically different.

estimation of blood glucose
plasma glucose levels were estimated by the glucoseoxidase-peroxidase method using the commercially available kit obtained from boehringer-mannheim, germany.28
estimation of insulin levels
plasma insulin levels were estimated by the elisa method
using the commercially available elisa kits obtained from
boehringer-mannheim, germany (enzymun test system
on es 33 analyzer).
estimation of no as its metabolite nitrite
no decomposes rapidly in aerated solutions to form
stable nitrite/nitrate products. in the present study, nitrite
concentrations were determined as an index of no synthesis. nitrite was quantitated colorimetrically after its
reaction with the griess reagent as described earlier.28,29
lipid peroxidation products
the total amount of lipid peroxidation products present
in the plasma samples of the controls and experimental
animals was estimated using the thiobarbituric acid (tba)
method,30 which measures the malondialdehyde (mda)
reaction products and, hence, is referred to as mda-eq
(mda-equivalents) substances. 1,1,3,3-tetraethoxy propane (tep) was used as the standard.
fatty acid analysis of the phospholipid fraction of
plasma, liver and muscle tissue
lipids in the plasma (0.5 ml), and liver and muscle
(500 mg of the tissue was homogenized in 5 ml of phosphate buffered saline and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for
20 min, and 1 ml of the supernatant was used for further
analysis) tissue were extracted by chloroform: methanol
(2 : 1 v/v containing 0.02% bht). total phospholipid (pl)
fraction present in the extracts was separated by thin
layer chromatography as described earlier.31,32 the fatty
acids present in the pl fraction was methylated by using
10% bf3-methanol and were analysed by gas liquid
chromatography using a tracor 540 gas chromatograph
(tracor, usa), as described earlier.31,32 it may be mentioned here that experiments with l-arginine and snp
were done separately and in batches, and each time the
experiment was performed a separate set of controls and
alloxan treatments were used. in view of this, the fatty-

statistical analysis
all the biochemical parameters mentioned above were
measured in the control and experimental animals on day
26, i.e. at the time of termination of the study. all values
obtained were expressed as mean ± sd. the statistical
analysis of the data obtained was done by using student’s
t-test and by one-way analysis of variance (anova).

results
development of diabetes and no and lipid peroxides in
the animals
all the animals that received alloxan developed type i dm
as expected (tables 1 & 2). in the alloxan-alone treated
group, the plasma glucose levels were high (around
430 mg/dl) and the plasma insulin levels were low. there
was also a significant decrease in the weight of the animals in the alloxan-treated group due to uncontrolled
diabetes. on the other hand, animals treated with insulin
had near normal plasma glucose levels, were normal in
their body weights and there were no deaths in this group
(tables 1 & 2).
experimental animals that received l-arginine, the precursor of no, and sodium nitroprusside, a donor of no,
24 h prior to, and simultaneously along with, alloxan also
developed diabetes mellitus but was of less severe degree,
as evidenced by lower blood sugar levels and significantly higher plasma insulin levels compared to the alloxanalone treated group (tables 1 & 2). these results indicate
that l-arginine and snp can prevent the development and
severity of diabetes to a significant degree, possibly by
preventing damage to the pancreatic b cells.27
it is known that uncontrolled diabetes is associated
with increase in free-radical generation and lipid peroxidation process. further, snp is a no donor, whereas
l-arginine is a precursor of no and, hence, we measured
the plasma levels of lipid peroxides and no in these
animals. it was observed that the levels of no were low
and lipid peroxides were high in the alloxan-treated
animals compared to the control, where they were maintained at near normal levels in l-arginine- and snp-treated animals (tables 3 & 4).

studies with no synthase inhibitor
to confirm the results obtained with l-arginine, studies
were also performed with  xxxd3291xxx , a specific inhibitor

of no synthesis. it is evident from the results given in
table 1 that  xxxd3291xxx  prevents the beneficial actions of
l-arginine, since type i diabetes seen in these ( xxxd3291xxx )
animals is as severe as that is seen in the alloxan control
group. similarly, even the plasma levels of lipid peroxides
and no were also found to be comparable to the concentrations of these biochemical abnormalities seen in the
alloxan-treated control group (table 3). a fall in the concentrations of insulin was also noted in the l-nmmatreated animals. from these results, it is evident that
 xxxd3291xxx  can completely block the beneficial actions of
l-arginine. in a similar fashion, even the beneficial actions
of l-arginine on body weight and survival of the animals
was also blocked by  xxxd3291xxx  treatment. further, in all
the three  xxxd3291xxx  + alloxan (i.e. pre-arginine +  xxxd3291xxx 
+ alloxan, simultaneous l-arginine +  xxxd3291xxx  + alloxan,
and  xxxd3291xxx  + alloxan control group) treated groups the
body weight of all the animals was found to be decreased
due to uncontrolled diabetes, and mortality rates were
similar to the alloxan-alone treated group (table 1).

alloxan +  xxxd3291xxx  and simultaneous l-arginine + alloxan +  xxxd3291xxx  groups were found to be similar to those
seen in the alloxan-alone treated group. these results
indicate, once again, that no synthase inhibitor, lnmma, can completely block the action of l-arginine on
efa metabolism. the concentrations of all the  xxxd2154xxx 
which were altered by alloxan treatment reverted to normalcy (control values) following insulin treatment. this
indicates that the activities of d-6-d and d-5-d are altered
in alloxan-induced diabetic animals and will become normal following the control of hyperglycemia by insulin.
liver pl fraction. the results of the fatty-acid analysis
of the liver pl fraction in the control, alloxan, l-arginine-

and  xxxd3291xxx -treated animals is given in table 6. a
marked decrease in the levels of sa, gla,  xxxd1886xxx , ala and
a concomitant increase in pa and dha was seen in the
alloxan-treated group compared to the control. the levels
of aa and epa were also low in the alloxan-treated group
but were not statistically significant. a significant increase
in the concentrations of sa was noted in the pre-larginine- + alloxan-treated group compared to the control. on the other hand, an increase in the levels of pa
and dha and a fall in the levels of sa was observed in the
simultaneous l-arginine- + alloxan-treated group compared to the control. in addition, an increase in the levels
of aa and ala, and a decrease in that of gla was noted
in the simultaneous l-arginine + alloxan group compared
to the alloxan-alone treated group. in all the l-nmmatreated groups, the changes in the fatty-acid pattern was
essentially similar to those seen in the alloxan-alone
treated group. this once again confirmed the fact that
 xxxd3291xxx  can interfere with the actions of l-arginine and
no on the metabolism of efas.

sis of the muscle pl fraction of alloxan-, l-arginine- and
 xxxd3291xxx -treated groups are given in table 7. a decrease
in the levels of sa and epa and a simultaneous increase
in pa was noted in the alloxan-treated group compared to
the control group. a decrease in the concentrations of la,
gla and  xxxd1886xxx  was also noted but was not statistically
significant. in the pre-l-arginine- + alloxan-treated group,
an increase in pa and a decrease in the levels of dha was
noted compared to the control. further, a significant
increase in the levels of aa and epa was noted in the prel-arginine- + alloxan-treated group compared to the
alloxan-alone treated group.
the changes in the fatty-acid pattern observed in the
simultaneous l-arginine- + alloxan-treated group was
similar to those seen in the pre-l-arginine- + alloxantreated group. the alterations in the fatty-acid pattern
noted in the alloxan-alone treated group returned to near
normalcy following insulin treatment.
snp-treatments
in order to determine whether the no donor, snp, also
has any affect on the metabolism of efas similar to those
seen with l-arginine, the precursor of no, we performed
the fatty acid analysis of the plasma, liver and muscle tissue in snp-treated animals.
plasma pl fraction. the results of the fatty acid analysis of the plasma pl fraction are given in table 8. a
significant decrease in the levels of sa, gla, aa, epa and
dha and an increase in that of oa was noted in the presnp (2, 5, 10 ug) + alloxan-treated group compared to the
control was observed.
liver pl fraction. the results of this study given in
table 9 showed an increase in the levels of sa and pa and
a decrease in the concentrations of gla, ala and epa in
the alloxan + pre-snp (2 ug) group compared to the control. similar results were obtained in the alloxan + presnp 5 ug and 10 ug treated groups also. even the alloxan
+ simultaneous snp (2, 5, 10 ug) treated groups also
showed similar changes in the levels of various  xxxd2154xxx 
similar to those seen in the alloxan- + pre-snp-treated
groups. these results suggest that irrespective of the time
of snp administration (whether pre or simultaneous)
along with alloxan, the changes in the fatty acid pattern
are similar.
muscle pl fraction. the results of this study shown in
table 10 revealed that in both the pre- and simultaneous
snp- + alloxan-treated groups the levels of gla were
found to be decreased compared to the control. on the
other hand, compared to the alloxan-alone treated group
the concentrations of gla were increased in the snp- +
alloxan-treated groups. this suggests that snp treatment
can restore the decreased gla levels (following alloxan
treatment), at least partly, close to the control values.

histopathology of pancreas
histopathological examination of the pancreas of alloxantreated group revealed b cell necrosis, a marked decrease
in the number of b cells, lymphocytic infiltration and disruption of cellular arrangement (data not shown). these
changes were completely abrogated by l-arginine and
snp treatment (data not shown).

discussion
oxygen derived free radicals generated in excess in
response to various stimuli can be cytotoxic to several tissues. most of the tissue damage is considered to be mediated by these free radicals by attacking membranes
through peroxidation of unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx .36
hiramatsu and arimori37 demonstrated an increase in the
generation of superoxide anion by mononuclear cells in
patients with diabetes mellitus. in the present study, the
concentrations of lipid peroxides were increased in wistar
rats treated with alloxan, which caused the development
of diabetes, indicating an increase in the generation of
free radicals. mordes and rossini38 showed that the diabetogenic actions of alloxan and  xxxd3249xxx  are as a
result of increased production of free radicals. kumar and
menon39 also observed that the levels of lipid peroxides
are increased in experimental animals following the
induction of dm. similar results were reported by other
workers also.40,41 oxygen-derived free radicals can damage pancreatic beta cells in experimental animals and in
humans resulting in type i dm. in the present study, both
l-arginine and snp treatments resulted in a decrease in
the levels of lipid peroxides in alloxan-induced diabetic
rats. control of hyperglycemia with insulin led to a fall in
the levels lipid peroxides to normalcy, suggesting that
enhanced levels of free radicals occurs in uncontrolled
diabetes.
it is now known that vascular relaxation in response to
agents which release no is impaired in diabetes.42,43
tesfamariam and cohen44 have postulated that increase
in superoxide anion production can contribute to
impaired relaxation response to acetylcholine in diabetes.
several studies have demonstrated that free-radical generation is increased in animals and humans with diabetes.20,27 hattori et al.45 demonstrated that superoxide
dismutase (sod) restores endothelium-dependent relaxation of the aorta in animals with diabetes. results of the
present study showed that there is indeed a significant
decrease in the concentrations of no in alloxan-induced
diabetic rats. these low levels of no could be due to its
inactivation by increased free radical generation (especially superoxide anion, 46) as evidenced by an increase
in the levels of lipid peroxides in animals with diabetes, as
as seen in the present study. low levels of no in diabetes

effect of l-arginine-no system on the metabolism of essential  xxxd2154xxx 

could also be due to an increase in the formation of ages
since, ages can quench no and also block its synthesis
by vascular endothelial cells.47,48
results of the present study also suggested that supplementation of l-arginine and snp can reduce the
severity of alloxan-induced diabetes in rats. this
beneficial effect can be attributed to the increased formation and release of no (tables 1 & 2). this is supported by the observation that oral supplementation of
l-arginine decreases hyperglycemia, increases insulin
secretion and the levels of no in patients with type ii
diabetes.28 it is also possible that l-arginine and snp
treatments can result in decreased formation of ages
and, thus, increase the levels of no. this is supported by
the fact that the formation of ages will be enhanced
whenever the degree of hyperglycemia is severe and the
results of the present study demonstrated that supplementation of both l-arginine and snp can decrease
the severity of diabetes. in an earlier study, we have also
shown that l-arginine and snp supplementation can
result in a significant increase in the levels of various
antioxidants such as sod,  xxxg981xxx ,
total glutathione,  xxxd3521xxx  and  xxxg500xxx  in
experimental animals with alloxan-induced type i diabetes.27
several studies support a causal relationship between
polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  and dm. first, pufas can
increase glucose transport; second, pufa supplementation can augment insulin secretion; third, pufas reduce
insulin resistance by increasing the cell membrane fluidity and by enhancing the binding of insulin to its receptor;
and fourth, by altering the production of eicosanoids
(reviewed in).5,10,20,27,28,35 in the present study, it was noted
that the plasma levels of saturated  xxxd2154xxx  were
increased, whereas the levels of unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx 
such as oa, la, gla and epa were decreased in rats with
alloxan-induced type i diabetes. almost the same type of,
if not identical, changes in the fatty-acid pattern were
noted in the plasma, liver and muscle pl fractions. these
results are supported by the observation that the levels of
 xxxd1886xxx , aa, ala and dha were noted to be low in patients
with type ii diabetes and diabetic nephropathy.49 it is
interesting to note that similar, if not identical, changes in
the fatty-acid pattern were noted both in patients with
dm and animals with chemical-induced diabetes (the present study).
several studies have shown that the activities of the
enzymes d-6-d and d-5- are depressed in dm.50,51 insulin
treatment is known to restore this abnormality to near
normalcy.50,51 the results of the present study also
showed that, following insulin treatment, the levels of
various pufas revert to normalcy.
in the present study, treatment with both l-arginine
and snp led to a significant improvement in the levels of

various pufas, such as la, gla,  xxxd1886xxx  and epa in the pl
fraction of plasma, liver and muscle tissues of animals
with diabetes. this indicates that the beneficial actions
of l-arginine in diabetes may, at least partly, reside in
the ability of no, which is formed from l-arginine, to
enhance d-6-d and d-5-d activities as observed in the
present study. since, the levels of various pufas are
decreased in alloxan-induced diabetes, and in patients
with type i and type ii diabetes, and as these  xxxd2154xxx 
form precursors to beneficial eicosanoids such as  xxxd124xxx ,
pgi2 and pgi3, dietary supplementation of pufas and/or
restoration of their levels to normalcy may be of benefit
in diabetes.
in summary, the results of the present study and of
various previous investigations suggest that the
beneficial actions of no in diabetes can be related to its
ability to enhance d-6-d and d-5-d activities in addition to
its own action on platelets and vascular tissue. on the
other hand, the possible beneficial action of pufas in diabetes can also be attributed to their capacity to enhance
no synthesis. thus, there seems to be a close interaction
between l-arginine- xxxd2738xxx  system and the metabolism of efas and this may be exploited in the management of dm and its complications.
