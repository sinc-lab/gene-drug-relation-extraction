abstract
[arg8]-vasopressin (avp) is an essential hormone for maintaining osmotic homeostasis and is known to be a potent vasoconstrictor that
regulates the cardiovascular system. in the present study, cardiomyocytes were isolated from neonatal mice and used to investigate the effects of
avp on cardiac hypertrophy. reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) analysis revealed that  xxxg229xxx  mrna,
but not v1b or  xxxg231xxx  mrna, was expressed in primary cultured neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. by exposing the cultured neonatal
cardiomyocytes to avp for 24 h, cell surface areas were significantly increased, suggesting that avp could induce cardiomyocyte growth. we then
investigated the expression level of the atrial natriuretic peptide (anp), which is a marker of cardiac hypertrophy. stimulation with avp increased
the expression of cardiomyocyte anp mrna in a dose- and time-dependent manner. immunocytochemical studies showed that stimulation with
avp significantly increased the expression of the anp protein as well. furthermore, avp administration activated extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (erk)1/2 in cardiomyocytes. the effects of avp on these parameters were significantly inhibited by a selective  xxxg229xxx 
antagonist, opc-21268, and were not observed in cardiomyocytes from mice lacking the  xxxg229xxx . in vivo cardiac hypertrophy in
response to pressure overload was attenuated in  xxxg229xxx -deficient ( xxxg229xxx -ko) mice. taken together, our data suggest that avp
promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via the  xxxg229xxx , which is in part regulated by the pathway of  xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling.

1. introduction
[arg8]-vasopressin (avp), the neurohypophyseal hormone,
is involved in important physiological functions, such as
osmotic regulation, vasoconstriction, and adrenocorticotropic
hormone (acth) release. these physiological effects are
mediated through the binding of avp to specific membrane
receptors in the target cells. avp receptors are coupled with the
g protein and have been divided into at least three types (v1a,
v2, and v1b, also termed v3). all of these receptors have been
cloned (de keyzer et al., 1994; lolait et al., 1992; morel et al.,
1992) and belong to the family of seven membrane spanning

receptors, which signal through g proteins (thibonnier et al.,
2002). the vasopressin v1a (vascular/hepatic) and v1b
(anterior pituitary) receptors act through phosphatidylinositol
hydrolysis to mobilize intracellular ca2+ (jard et al., 1986). the
 xxxg229xxx  mediates physiological effects, such
as cell contraction and proliferation, platelet aggregation,
coagulation factor release, and glycogenolysis. the vasopressin
 xxxg230xxx  exists in the anterior pituitary, where it stimulates
 xxxd1752xxx  release (tanoue et al., 2004). the vasopressin v2
receptors are found primarily in the kidney. they are linked to
adenylate cyclase and the production of camp and are
associated with antidiuresis (thibonnier, 1988).
avp is a potent antidiuretic, vasoconstricting, and growthstimulating neuropeptide that contributes to the pathogenesis of
hypertension and heart failure (schrier and abraham, 1999).
patients with heart failure have chronically elevated plasma

vasopressin concentrations, which may contribute to their
clinical syndrome of fluid retention (sanghi et al., 2005).
furthermore, avp has adverse effects in heart failure and
increasing peripheral resistance via constrictor actions at the
 xxxg229xxx  (sanghi et al., 2005; yatsu et al.,
1999). thus, blockade of the  xxxg229xxx  could be
a useful adjunct to standard therapy in congestive heart failure.
in addition to their involvement in the pathogenesis of heart
failure, avp as well as other neurohormonal factors, such as
catecholamines,  xxxg99xxx , and  xxxg674xxx  (et-1), may
play important roles in the development of cardiac hypertrophy
in symptomatic congestive heart failure by increasing peripheral
vascular resistance and cardiac afterload (cowley et al., 1981;
kawano et al., 1997; riegger and liebau, 1982). catecholamines,  xxxg99xxx , and et-1 can induce cardiac hypertrophy
in the cardiomyocytes and directly affect cardiac remodeling
(aceto and baker, 1990; ito et al., 1991; simpson, 1985). avp
also could induce cardiac hypertrophy (nakamura et al., 2000).
however, it has not been clarified whether avp promoted the
cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by increasing vascular resistance or
directly stimulated cardiomyocytes.
several studies have shown that avp increases the rate of
protein synthesis in cardiomyocytes and heart in rats and humans,
suggesting that avp might be a promoter of ventricular
hypertrophy. however, little is known about avp-induced
ventricular hypertrophy in mice. an insight into the mechanisms
regulating the hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes may provide clues
for the treatment of patients with heart failure. recently, we
developed a mutant mouse lacking the  xxxg229xxx ,
which is considered to be a good model for analyzing the
mechanism of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by avp stimulation.
the current study was conducted to determine whether avp
induces the hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes, and, if so, to
determine whether the  xxxg229xxx  is involved in
these effects.
2. materials and methods
2.1. materials and animals
[arg8]-vasopressin (avp) and  xxxg674xxx  (et-1) were
purchased from the peptide institute, inc. (osaka, japan). the
 xxxg229xxx  antagonist, opc-21268 (1-{1-[4-(3acetylaminopropoxy)benzoyl]-4-piperidyl}- xxxd1818xxx )quinolinone), was a gift from the otsuka pharmaceutical co.
(tokyo, japan).  xxxd3462xxx , an erk inhibitor, was from promega
co. (madison, usa). the anti-alpha-actinin antibody was purchased from sigma (st. louis, usa). phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2 and
 xxxg1369xxx /2 antibodies were purchased from cell signaling
technology (beverly, usa). the atrial natriuretic peptide
(anp) was from santa cruz biotechnology (santa cruz, usa).
 xxxg229xxx -deficient ( xxxg229xxx -ko) mice were
generated by homologous recombination, as described previously (koshimizu et al., 2006; egashira et al., 2004). nonvasopressin  xxxg229xxx -deficient littermates were used as wild
type control subjects for  xxxg229xxx -ko mice. cardiomyocytes were
isolated from one-day-old wild type or  xxxg229xxx -ko mice and

cultured for experiments. mice were maintained under
controlled conditions at 23 °c with food and water available
ad libitum. the experiments were approved by the committee
on the ethical aspects of research involving animals of the
national research institute for child health and development.
2.2. cell culture
primary ventricular myocytes were prepared as described
previously (gray et al., 1998). ventricles from one-day-old wild
type and  xxxg229xxx -ko mice were minced, and cells were isolated
by multiple rounds of 8-min-long tissue dissociation with
0.01% trypsin. after incubation with trypsin, the supernatant
was added to an equal volume of dulbecco's modified eagle's
medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and all of the
supernatants were combined. the cardiomyocytes were collected by different adhesiveness. cardiomyocyte-enriched
suspensions were removed from the culture dishes and plated
at a density of 150–200 cells/mm2 after overnight incubation.
cultures were maintained in dulbecco's modified eagle's
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and
0.1 mm bromodeoxyuridine to prevent fibroblast proliferation.
2.3. protein, dna, and rna content in cardiomyocytes
cardiomyocytes were plated on six-well plates and cultured in
a serum-free condition for 24 h before experiments. cardiomyocytes were treated with 0.1 mum avp and further cultured for 24 h.
after stimulation with avp, each dish was rinsed three times with
ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. the cell layer was scraped
from each dish with 1 ml standard sodium citrate (200 mm, ph
4.8) containing 0.25% (wt/vol) sodium  xxxd3215xxx  and frozen
at −80 °c until the assay. the extracts were thawed and vortexed
extensively. the 100 mul extract was used for the protein assay
according to the instructions for use of a bicinchoninic acid
protein assay kit (pierce, rockford, usa). dna was isolated
from 200 mul extracts by the phenol–chloroform method and
measured using a spectrometer (biospec mini analyzer, shimadzu co., kyoto, japan). rnawas isolated from 100 mul extracts
according to the instructions for the use of a mini-rna kit
(qiagen, valencia, usa) and measured using the spectrometer.
2.4. rt-pcr analysis
for the rt-pcr analysis, total rna was extracted from
cultured neonatal myocytes. the samples were treated with
dnase and then subjected to first-strand synthesis using an oligo
(dt) primer and reverse transcriptase (superscript ii, invitrogen,
carlsbad, usa). the following mouse v1a, v1b, and  xxxg231xxx 
primers were used: v1a, 5′-ccgtgctgggtaatagcagt-3′
and 5′-tcttcactgtgcggatcttg-3′; v 1 b , 5′tacaggtgctcagcatgttt-3′ and 5′-attctcgtcccacacagacc-3′; and v2, 5′-tgtggctctgtttcaagtgc3′ and 5′-cacagctgcacaaggaagaa-3′. mouse anp
and  xxxg861xxx  mrna were amplified by pcr using the following
primers: mouse anp, 5′-gggggtaggattgacaggat-3′
and 5′-cagagtgggaga ggcaagac-3′; and mouse

 xxxg861xxx , 5′-caatcaccatcttccaggag-3′ and 5′ttcagctctgggatgacctt-3′. thermal cycling was performed for 1 min at 95 °c, 30 s at 60 °c, and 30 s at 72 °c for
25 cycles with an initial denaturation at 95 °c for 5 min and a final
extension step at 72 °c for 7 min. after amplification, the products
were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel.
2.5. immunocytochemistry
cardiomyocytes were prepared for immunocytochemical
staining as described previously (taigen et al., 2000). for alphaactinin and anp staining, cardiomyocytes were cultured on
gelatin-precoated glass covers for 24 h and then free serum for
24 h and fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min after
treatment with 0.1 mum avp and diluted water. the glass covers
were incubated with antibodies to alpha-actinin (1:500) and anp
(1:100) overnight at 4 °c followed by alexor fluor 594 antimouse antibody and anti-rabbit antibody at a dilution of 1:500.
the quantification of anp expression was performed by
counting the anp expression in 100 cardiomyocytes.
2.6. cardiomyocyte surface area
the cardiomyocyte surface area was measured on alpha-actininstained cardiomyocytes by the method of simpson (simpson,
1985). cell images, which were viewed using a video camera
(nikon co., tokyo, japan) fixed to a microscope (nikon co.,
tokyo, japan), were projected onto a monitor and traced. nih
image analysis software directed the computation of the
cardiomyocyte area. the area was then doubled to account
for the surface portion in contact with the dish. all cells from
randomly selected fields in 2 or 3 wells were examined for
each condition. we measured 100 cells in each condition. the
cardiomyocyte area was determined after 24 h of treatment
with avp (1 mum) and et-1 (1 mum), in contrast to the control
cells, which were treated with their diluents (diluted water).
2.7. western blot analysis
protein was extracted from the cultured cardiomyocytes after
stimulation with avp and et-1 for 30 min. the cells were lysed

fig. 2. effects of avp on the protein, dna, and rna contents were determined.
cardiomyocytes were plated at a density of 150–200 cells/mm2 and incubated in
a serum-free medium, and avp was added to a final concentration of 100 nm for

in a lysis buffer (100 mm nacl, 50 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.6),
10 mm beta2- xxxd26xxx , 1 mm edta, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pmsf), and 0.25% tritonx-100). the
concentration of whole protein was measured using the
bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit. protein lysates (20 mug)
were analyzed by 12.5% sodium  xxxd3215xxx  polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) gels, electrotransferred
to a polyvinylidene difluoride (pvdf) membrane (bio-rad
laboratories, hercules, usa), and probed with antibodies to
phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2 (1:1000) and  xxxg1369xxx /2 (1:1000), followed by
appropriate horseradish peroxidase (hrp)-conjugated secondary antibodies. the peroxidase reaction products were visualized using a lumiglo chemiluminescent substrate (new
england lab, woburn, usa). the same membrane was then
stripped and re-probed with the anti- xxxg1369xxx /2 antibody to
determine the total protein abundance using a similar procedure.
2.8. in vivo hypertrophic response

fig. 1. expression of the avp receptor mrna was determined by rt-pcr using
specific primers in primary cultured cardiomyocyte isolated from wild type or
 xxxg229xxx -ko mice. the amplified pcr products for v1a, v1b, v2, and  xxxg861xxx 
were 696-, 581-, 618-, and 475-bp in size, respectively. the expression of
 xxxg861xxx  was measured as an internal control to evaluate sample-to-sample
differences in rna concentration.

in order to determine the hypertrophic response in vivo,
 xxxg229xxx -ko mice were subjected to a thoracic aortic constriction
(tac) surgery as described previously (rockman et al., 1991).
eight-to 12-week-old male mice from either genotype were

anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine cocktail (100 mg/kg and
10 mg/kg, respectively, i.p.) and connected to a rodent ventilator
after endotracheal intubation. the aorta was partially ligated
with 7-0 silk around a 27-gauge blunted needle, which was
subsequently removed to generate a calibrated constriction. to
determine the hemodynamic overload imposed on the left
ventricle, the systolic pressure gradient between right carotid
and systemic arterial pressures was measured under pentobarbital anesthesia (40 mg/kg, i.p.) one week after the tac surgery.
after measurement of the pressure gradient, the heart was
isolated, and the heart weight was measured.
2.9. statistical analysis
all values were expressed as the means ± s.e.m. statistical
significance was determined using the unpaired student's t-test

or one-way analysis of variance. the results were considered to
be significant when p < 0.05.
3. results
3.1. expression of vasopressin receptor mrna in cultured
cardiomyocytes from neonatal mice
to determine whether vasopressin receptors are involved in
the response of cardiomyocytes to avp, we first examined the
expression of three kinds of vasopressin receptor subtypes in
primary cardiomyocytes isolated from neonatal mice. we found
that the  xxxg229xxx  mrna was expressed in the
primary cardiomyocytes and did not detect the expression of
v1b and  xxxg231xxx  mrna (fig. 1). therefore,  xxxg229xxx -ko mice
were useful to understand the avp effects on cardiomyocytes.

1 mum avp and  xxxg674xxx  (et-1) stimulation. (a) cardiomyocyte immunostained with alpha-actinin antibody (red). the cells stimulated with avp revealed
morphological hypertrophy. (b) surface areas of cardiomyocytes were quantified from different treatment cultures. alpha-actinin-stained cells were imaged, and surface

controls. ⁎⁎⁎, significant differences (p < 0.001) from the value of the wild type control. opc: opc-21268.

mrnas from the kidney and pituitary were used as positive
control for v2 and v1b, respectively.
3.2. changes of total protein, dna, and rna components on
primary cardiomyocytes after treatment with avp
to determine the effects of avp on the total protein, dna,
and rna content, we used cultured cardiomyocytes from
neonatal wild type and  xxxg229xxx -ko mice. these cardiomyocytes were cultured under a serum-free condition for 24 h
before the experiments, treated with avp, and further cultured
for 24 h. after stimulation with avp, the protein-to-dna
ratio and rna-to-dna ratio were measured. the protein-todna ratios in avp-treated cardiomyocytes were significantly
higher than those of the vehicle-treated controls (fig. 2a).
the rna-to-dna ratio was significantly increased after
exposure to avp (fig. 2b). the total dna concentration was
not altered in each treated cell. these findings indicated that
avp increased the protein synthesis that led to the
acceleration of cardiomyocyte growth. in order to determine
whether avp increased protein synthesis via the vasopressin
 xxxg229xxx , we next treated the cardiomyocytes from wild
type neonatal mice with opc-21268, a vasopressin v1a
receptor-selective antagonist. the protein-to-dna ratios and
rna-to-dna ratios were not increased in the cardiomyocytes
from the wild type neonatal mice by treatment with opc21268 for 15 min before avp administration (fig. 2a and b).
similarly, the protein-to-dna and rna-to-dna ratios were
not increased in the cardiomyocytes from the  xxxg229xxx -ko
neonatal mice by exposure to avp (fig. 2a and b), suggesting
that avp could promote cardiomyocyte growth via the
 xxxg229xxx .
3.3. increase in cardiomyocyte areas by exposure to avp
because cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by the
enlargement of cardiomyocytes, we examined the influence
of exposure to avp on cardiomyocyte surface areas. the
cardiomyocyte surface areas were significantly increased in the
cultured cardiomyocytes exposed to avp (1 mum) for 24 h but
not in the cardiomyocytes from the  xxxg229xxx -ko neonatal mice
(fig. 3). in addition, the increase in cardiomyocyte surface
areas was inhibited by pre-administration of the vasopressin
 xxxg229xxx  antagonist, opc-21268, in the cultured cardiomyocytes from the wild type neonatal mice (fig. 3). these
results suggest that avp can promote cardiomyocyte hyper-

trophy through the  xxxg229xxx . another hypertrophic agonist, et-1, was used as a positive control. et-1
significantly increased the cell surface areas from wild type
and  xxxg229xxx -ko mice, but opc-21268 did not affect the cell
surface areas (fig. 3).

3.4. expression of anp mrna and protein translation after
avp stimulation
we further characterized avp-induced cardiomyocyte
hypertrophy by examining mrna and protein expression of
anp, a marker for cardiac hypertrophy. the expression of anp
mrna was increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner in
the cardiomyocytes stimulated with avp (fig. 4a and b).
immunocytochemical results revealed that avp also induced
the expression of the anp protein in the perinuclear regions of
the cell, as demonstrated by the appearance of a circular band at
the nuclear membrane (fig. 5). approximately 70–85% of the
avp-stimulated cells under 20-times magnification exhibited
the expression of anp around the perinuclear regions.
pretreatment with the  xxxg229xxx  antagonist,
opc-21268, inhibited the expression of anp mrna and
protein (figs. 4c and 5). similarly, no anp mrna or protein
induction was observed in the cardiomyocytes from the v1arko mice (figs. 4 and 5).
3.5. avp induced  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation
previous results have suggested that the ras- xxxg1924xxx - xxxg1369xxx /2
signaling pathway plays an important role in cardiomyocyte
hypertrophy (molkentin and dorn, 2001; wang and proud,

2002). to analyze the signaling pathway after vasopressin v1a
receptor activation, we examined changes in  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation by western blot analysis. our results showed that
avp induced  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation, which was inhibited by
pretreatment with opc-21268 (fig. 6a). similarly, avp could
not induce  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation in the cardiomyocytes
from  xxxg229xxx -ko neonatal mice (fig. 6a). et-1 also enhanced
 xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation, but opc-21268 had no effect on the
phosphorylation by et-1 and the basal level (fig. 6b).
furthermore, erk inhibitor,  xxxd3462xxx , was used to ensure the
role of erk in avp-induced hypertrophy.  xxxd3462xxx  inhibited
avp- and et-1-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (fig. 6c
and d). these results suggest that avp induces cardiomyocyte
hypertrophy via erk phosphorylation.
3.6. in vivo hypertrophic response
all our results using isolated cardiomyocytes indicate that
the avp can induce cardiac hypertrophy via the vasopressin
 xxxg229xxx . to extend these findings to in vivo studies, we
performed tac surgery. the heart/body weight ratio in v1arko mice after the tac surgery was lower than that in wild type
mice (fig. 7), whereas the pressure gradient was similar
between  xxxg229xxx -ko and wild type mice (wild type mice; 106 ±
8 mmhg,  xxxg229xxx -ko mice; 132 ± 7 mmhg). the results indicate

role in cardiac hypertrophy in response to pressure overload.
4. discussion
avp is a peptide hormone that modulates a number of
processes implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure
(krismer et al., 2004). through the activation of vasopressin
v1a and v2 receptors, avp regulates various physiological
processes, including bodily fluid regulation, vascular tone
regulation, and cardiovascular contractility (krismer et al.,
2004). vasopressin v1a receptors are expressed on both
vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes and have
been shown to modulate blood vessel vasoconstriction and
myocardial function in rats and humans (penit et al., 1983;
thibonnier et al., 1994). in the present study, we found that
vasopressin v1a receptors, but not v1b and v2 receptors, were
expressed in the neonatal mouse heart and investigated avpinduced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy with cultured cardiomyocytes from the  xxxg229xxx -ko and wild type neonatal mice.
avp is implicated in the stimulation of myocardial cell
hypertrophy by enhancing protein synthesis and cellular growth
without affecting cell division in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes
(nakamura et al., 2000; tahara et al., 1998). similar to the
observation in rats, our results also showed that avp increased
the protein synthesis and cell surface areas of cardiomyocytes in
neonatal mice. since there was no cell division, as indicated by
the stable dna content, the avp-induced growth response was

probably cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. at the same time, we
found that avp stimulation increased the expression of anp.
anp is mainly synthesized in the atria of the normal adult heart,
but a small amount of anp mrna has also been found in the
normal adult ventricular myocytes, where the expression level is
approximately 0.5 to 3% of that in the atria (ruskoaho, 1992).
the expression of atrial anp is initially low and increases
during development. in contrast to the low expression of anp
in the neonatal atria, ventricular myocytes from neonatal hearts
contain substantial amounts of anp mrna, which decline
rapidly after birth (ruskoaho, 1992). the ventricular expression
and secretion of anp are substantially elevated in cardiac

hypertrophy, suggesting the involvement of anp in developing
cardiac hypertrophy. anp secretion is induced by mechanical
stimulation, such as the stretching of myocytes (lang et al.,
1985), as well as by a number of hormones and vasoactive
peptides, such as avp (ruskoaho, 1992). in addition, avp is
known to stimulate prostacyclin and anp release from cultured
rat cardiomyocytes (van der bent et al., 1994). therefore, avp
could induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by mediating total
protein increase and anp release.
opc-21268 was reported as an orally effective, non-peptide
 xxxg229xxx  antagonist that specifically antagonized the responses to avp in vitro and in vivo (yamamura et al.,
1991). furthermore, among vasopressin receptors, only the
vasopressin v1a receptors were found in the neonatal mouse
cardiomyocytes by rt-pcr analysis. therefore, we investigated
the effects of opc-21268 on avp-induced protein synthesis and
cell growth in neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. we found that
opc-21268 could inhibit avp-induced total protein synthesis
and avp-induced growth of cell surface areas and that avp
induced the increase of anp mrna and protein, which suggests
that stimulation with avp could cause neonatal cardiomyocyte
hypertrophy via the  xxxg229xxx . to confirm these
results, we used cardiomyocytes from  xxxg229xxx -ko and wild type
mice to examine these effects and found that avp could not
increase the protein synthesis, growth of cell surface areas, and
expression of anp mrna and protein in the cardiomyocytes
from  xxxg229xxx -ko neonatal mice. thus, analysis with the selective
antagonist and gene-mutated mice for the vasopressin v1a
receptor demonstrated that avp could induce cardiomyocyte
hypertrophy via the  xxxg229xxx . in addition to
these results, cardiac hypertrophy in response to pressure
overload was attenuated in  xxxg229xxx -ko mice, suggesting that
avp- xxxg229xxx  signaling contributes to cardiac hypertrophy
in response to pressure overload. this finding is consistent with
another finding, namely, that the activation of vasopressin v1a
receptors was strongly associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and collagen deposition in rats, which was attenuated by
specific  xxxg229xxx  antagonists (nakamura et al.,
2000). thus, avp stimulation may play a causal role in
myocardial hypertrophy under certain circumstances.
several factors, including phenylephrine and et-1, are
known to stimulate cardiomyocytes. while phenylephrine and
et-1 have been shown to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy
via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) pathway
(bogoyevitch et al., 1993), it remains unclear which pathways
are involved in avp-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. since
the erk family of mapks ( xxxg1369xxx /2), known as p42/44 map
kinase, was the first of the mapk pathways proposed to
participate in hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes (bogoyevitch et
al., 1993; sugden, 2001), we investigated the possible
involvement of  xxxg1369xxx /2 in the cardiomyocyte hypertrophy
induced by avp stimulation. our results revealed that avp
could induce  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation and that pretreatment
with the v1a antagonist opc-21268 inhibited this effect. in
addition, avp stimulation could not induce  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes from  xxxg229xxx -ko neonatal mice.
furthermore, the erk inhibitor,  xxxd3462xxx , specifically inhibited

avp-induced hypertrophy. thus, our results show that avp
stimulation induces neonatal cardiomyocyte hypertrophy partly
via the erk pathway, which is mediated by the vasopressin v1a
receptor.
in summary, we demonstrated that avp increased the total
protein synthesis and expression of anp mrna and protein in
mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes, in part by stimulating the
phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2. our results from this study with the
 xxxg229xxx  antagonist, opc-21268, and v1arko mice demonstrated that neonatal cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by exposure to avp was mediated by the vasopressin v1a
receptor and erk signaling and that this avp- xxxg229xxx 
signaling pathway plays a significant role in cardiac hypertrophy
in response to pressure overload.
