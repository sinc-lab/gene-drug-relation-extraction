testosterone-mediated modulation of herg blockade by proarrhythmic agents.  diverse drugs from many therapeutic classes exert cardiotoxic side effects by inducing torsades de pointes (tdp), a life threatening cardiac arrhythmia, which often results from drug interaction with herg (human ether-a-go-go related gene) encoded k(+) channels, that generate an i(kr) component of the delayed rectifier cardiac k(+) current. men are known to be at a lower risk for drug-induced tdp than women suggesting a role of sex steroid hormones, androgens and estrogens, in modulation of drug sensitivity of cardiac k(+) channels, particularly those encoded by herg. here by using neuroleptic agents haloperidol,  xxxd2956xxx , and  xxxd2142xxx , all of which can induce tdp, and a steroid hormone-sensitive system xenopus oocytes for herg channels expression we show that testosterone is able to reduce herg-blocking potency of neuroleptics. haloperidol,  xxxd2956xxx , and  xxxd2142xxx  inhibited herg current with ic(50) of 1.36, 1.74, and 2.34 microm, and maximal block of 73%, 76% and 65%, respectively. the action of these neuroleptics was voltage-dependent, most consistent with an open-channel blocking mechanism. pretreatment of herg-expressing oocytes with 1 microm testosterone increased the ic(50) values to 2.73, 2.08, and 5.04 microm, reduced the maximal block to 65%, 59%, and 64%, and strongly diminished voltage-dependence of the blockade. testosterone treatment per se produced about a 35% reduction of herg current compared with untreated oocytes. our data suggest that androgens may protect against the arrhythmogenic actions of some cardiotoxic drugs.
