abstract

prostate dependence on androgens

normal growth and function of the prostate are contingent on the reduction
of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (dht) by 5-alpha reductase
(5-ar) enzymes types 1 and 2. it has been theorized that an overabundance
of dht may be implicated in the pathogenesis of both benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) and prostate cancer. inhibitors of 5-ar such as dutasteride and
finasteride may therefore have an important role in the prevention and treatment of bph and prostate cancer. dutasteride provides greater suppression of
dht than finasteride, thereby underlying the hypothesis that inhibition of both
type 1 and type 2 would provide correspondingly greater protection than inhibition of type 2 alone. we review the potential significance of the 5-ar
inhibitors in reducing the risk of prostate cancer according to the basic biology of prostate disease

androgens play an essential role in prostatic
development and function, but are also
involved in prostate disease pathogenesis.6
without androgens, the prostate would not
develop and the gland would atrophy if androgen support was withdrawn.5 the principal and
functionally active androgen dht is synthesized from testosterone by 5-ar types 1 and
2.6,7 this leads to a 5-fold higher concentration
of dht v. testosterone within the prostate cells,
v. an 11-fold higher concentration of testosterone in the blood.4 free testosterone diffuses directly into the epithelial or stromal cells
of the prostate, where it is converted rapidly
and irreversibly into dht by the 5-ar system
positioned on the nuclear membrane. dht
binds to the  xxxg183xxx  with high affinity, and this complex, mediated by coregulators such as  xxxg1512xxx , is transported into the
nucleus. once inside, this newly formed complex binds to androgen-responsive elements,
initiates transcription and ultimately controls
the regulation of the cell cycle, cell growth and
differentiation.7
5-ar has the biologically important role of
being able to concentrate intraprostatic dht
when/if serum testosterone levels are physiologically low. as serum testosterone levels
increase, there is less of this need of 5-ar to
help accumulate androgen in the prostate.8
in a study by wright and colleagues,8 spraguedawley rats were castrated for 2 weeks to allow
their prostates to fully regress and were then
given testosterone implants of various sizes
in the presence or absence of a 5-ar inhibitor.
dramatic increases in prostate weight were
seen even at the lowest serum testosterone levels in the absence of 5-ar inhibition, while
significantly higher serum testosterone levels
were needed to achieve prostate growth in the

introduction

pportunities for studying the molecular action of androgens
emerged in the 1960s, when radioactive compounds suitable
for experimentation were initially introduced. in 1968,
bruchovsky and wilson1,2 and anderson and liao3 reported that dihydrotestosterone is the active intracellular form of testosterone, and receptors for dihydrotestosterone were demonstrated for the first time. two
isoforms of the enzyme have been identified: type 1, which is found
in skin, prostatic epithelium and to a lesser extent in stroma, and type 2,
which predominates in prostatic stromal tissue. normal growth and function of the prostate are contingent on the reduction of testosterone to
dihydrotestosterone (dht) by 5-alpha reductase (5-ar).
overabundance of dht has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) and prostate cancer. preventing dht
synthesis via 5-ar inhibition has been shown to have a remarkable effect
on benign prostatic disease with low toxicity.4 thus, there is much
interest in the potential role for 5-ar inhibitors (5-aris) in the management of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (pin) and the prevention of
prostate cancer.5 this report reviews current knowledge about the role
of androgens and the 5-ar system in prostate disease and highlights their
significance in reducing the risk of prostate cancer.

presence of 5-ar inhibition.8 the difference in
potency of testosterone v. dht in relation to
prostate growth is small compared with intraprostatic androgen concentrations, but is much greater
if serum testosterone levels are considered.8
a critical question regarding androgen action
is whether testosterone and dht are responsible for regulating the expression of different androgen-response genes in the prostate. experimental
studies suggest that testosterone is more potent
than dht in stimulating the expression of many
androgen-response genes in the regressed
prostate. 9 the expression of these androgenresponse genes is likely to be associated with
androgen-dependent and prostate-specific differentiation, including the very important preservation of the capacity of prostatic cells to undergo
apoptosis, and less associated with stimulating
proliferation during prostate growth.9 on the other
hand, high levels of intracellular dht result in
cellular proliferation and delay in cellular differentiation, an important fact when considering

5-ars and prostate cancer development
5-ar2 has traditionally been viewed as the most
clinically relevant of the 5-ar isoenzymes because
of its high concentration in prostatic tissue and
its greater affinity to bind testosterone than 5-ar1.6
however, more recently, 5-ar1 expression has also
been shown to be increased in prostate cancer compared with normal and bph tissue at both the messenger rna (mrna) level10,11 and at the protein
level.10,12 thomas and colleagues provide a review
of this data.6 iehlé and colleagues11 have shown that
the expression of 5-ar1 mrna was significantly
increased (p < 0.05) in prostate cancer compared
with normal and bph tissue but that the level of
5-ar2 mrna was not statistically different from
that observed in normal prostate.11 by contrast, the
increased expression of 5-ar1 mrna in bph tissue was not statistically different from that of type
2 in the same tissue.11 similarly, thomas and colleagues10 showed that 5-ar1 mrna levels are
increased, whereas 5-ar2 mrna levels are
decreased, in primary prostate cancer compared
with normal and bph tissues. thomas and colleagues13 also showed by immunostaining that
5-ar1 is increased in adjacent benign tissues, lowgrade prostate cancer and moderate-grade prostate
cancer compared with that in bph. 5-ar1 was even
further increased in high-grade cancers compared
with bph, or low- and moderate-grade cancers
(figure 1).13 by contrast, staining for 5-ar2 was
decreased in adjacent benign tissue, as well as in
low- and moderate-grade cancers compared with
that in bph, and was increased in high-grade cancers compared with low-grade cancers (figure 1).13
a recent study by xu and colleagues14 reported that
5-ar2 enzymatic activity was more than 10-fold
higher than 5-ar1 enzymatic activity in both normal rat ventral prostatic cells and normal human
prostate tissue. however, prostate cancer cells from
both humans and rats expressed low levels of 5ar2, and enhanced levels of 5-ar1 activity compared with nonmalignant tissues.14 thomas and colleagues have demonstrated that levels of both
5-ar1 and 5-ar2 are increased in localized highv. low-grade prostate cancer and that the levels
of 5-ar1 were higher in benign tissue adjacent
to cancer than in bph. the mean (+ sem) area of
moderate-to-high staining for 5-ar1 increased from
20.5% (3.7%) in low-grade cancers (gleason score

5-alpha reductase inhibitors in prostate pathophysiology

5-ars as targets for prevention and
management
dutasteride and finasteride are both 5-aris available for use in the management of bph.15
finasteride is a potent inhibitor of 5-ar2 (ic50
69 nmol/l) but much less effective at inhibiting
5-ar1 (ic50 360 nmol/l). by contrast, dutasteride
has been proven to competitively inhibit both
5-ar1 and 5-ar2 (ic50 6 nmol/l and 7 nmol/l,
respectively) and to a greater degree than finasteride.6 thus the question arises: does a dual
inhibitor of 5-ar outperform that of a single inhibitor?

dht suppression
xu and colleagues14 reported that dutasteride, but
not finasteride (even at a dose of 72 mg/kg per day),
suppressed dht content and inhibited dunning
r-3327h prostate cancer growth in non-castrated
male rats. interestingly, when rats were treated with
dutasteride, prostate cancer growth was significantly reduced, but not to the same extent as with
castration, which eliminates testosterone,14 thereby supporting the notion that although testosterone
is not as potent as dht it still can stimulate cellular metabolism and malignant growth to a certain extent. xu and colleagues also reported that
although daily oral treatment with finasteride
(70 mg/kg per day, twice a day) significantly
reduced the growth of lncap human prostate cancer xenografts in non-castrated male nude mice,
the reduction was not as dramatic as that by
equimolar dosing with dutasteride (100 mg/kg per
day, twice a day). the fact that dutasteride reduced
growth to a greater extent than finasteride in both
intact and castrated mice further supports the importance of type 1 inhibition.14

results of a phase ii, double-blind, placebocontrolled, comparative dose-ranging trial clearly
showed that serum dht suppression was significantly greater with dutasteride (94.7% ± 3.3% with
0.5 mg) than with finasteride (70.8 ± 18.3%, p <
0.001), and that the response to dutasteride was
less variable. serum dht concentrations returned
to within 20% of baseline values in only 4 weeks
post-treatment in patients given finasteride, compared to 16 weeks in those given dutasteride (figure
2).16 from the same study, roehrborrn and colleagues17 reported greater than 90% dht suppression in 85.4% of patients treated with dutasteride
(0.5 mg) and in only 2.2% of patients treated with
finasteride (5 mg). by comparison, greater than 70%
dht suppression was observed in 100% of the
dutasteride-treated patients and in 49% of the finasteride-treated patients.17,18 in another approach,
gleave and colleagues19 showed that men who
were treated with dutasteride (doses 0.5 mg daily
or higher) for 4 months prior to radical prostatectomy had significantly lower intraprostatic dht concentrations but had higher testosterone concentrations than in untreated prostatectomies. furthermore,
men who received dutasteride had lower tumour
volumes, without significant changes in treatment
alteration scores or atrophy, than those who received
surgery alone.19 similarly, iczkowski and colleagues20
showed that in cancer tissues from men who
received pre-surgical treatment with dutasteride
compared with that from men treated with finasteride, tumour volume had decreased significantly (mean 15% v. 24%, p = 0.025), the percentage

(gleason score 8-10) (p = 0.0439, high v. low
grade).13 staining in 21 moderate-grade (gleason
score 7) cancers was the same as in low-grade cancers.13 therefore, an important point to consider
is that 5-ar1, based on its increased expression
in all prostate cancer tissue except for bph, and
especially its predominance in higher grades of
cancer, may play an important role in premalignant and malignant tissues. this generates the
hypothesis that the inhibition of both isoenzymes
would be more effective for prevention and possibly treatment of prostate cancer than inhibition
of 5-ar2 alone in man.6

of atrophic epithelium had increased (p = 0.041)
and both the stroma/gland ratio and treatment alteration effect had doubled. the ability to induce phenotypic alterations in both the benign and neoplastic prostate suggest a potential chemopreventive
role for dutasteride.20

and 5-ar2 are both increased13 so that finasteride
will theoretically block progression of low-grade
cancers but not high-grade cancers. this issue may
be clarified with the release of the reduction by
dutasteride of prostate cancer events (reduce)
study data.28

effects on serum psa concentration

influence of somatic 5-ar mutations

prostate specific antigen (psa) is a biomarker whose
expression is governed by androgens, and whose
serum concentration can be used in the detection
of prostate cancer. that said, treatment with 5-aris
such as finasteride or dutasteride results in decreased
serum psa concentrations, which may make the
interpretation of the test difficult.21 in the randomized, double-blind, active-controlled enlarged
prostate international comparative study (epics),
dutasteride and finasteride treatment resulted in similar median psa suppression of approximately
55% at 12 months (glaxosmithkline, data on file).
finasteride treatment in the pless trial resulted in
a median change of 57% after 4 years.22 marks and
colleagues,23 in a review of 3 large-scale, phase iii
studies, reported that dutasteride treatment results
in a median change in psa of 66% at 4 years.
differences in psa suppression between finasteride
and dutasteride may reflect the impact of blocking 5-ar1 in prostate cells. that psa is not reduced
to zero implies ongoing binding of testosterone on
the  xxxg183xxx , which normally is much
weaker than dht binding,24 or the possible existence of a type 3 isoenzyme.25 the significance of
these data is highlighted by the results of the prostate
cancer prevention trial (pcpt), in which the overall decrease in prostate cancer cases associated with
finasteride treatment was coupled with an increase
in the number of high-grade prostate cancer cases.26
thirty-seven percent of cancers in the finasteride
group had a gleason score of 7 to 10 compared
with 22% in the placebo group, with the increase
in high-grade cancers present mainly in the gleason
8 to 10 range.26 it has been suggested that detection
bias for high-grade tumours in patients treated with
finasteride may help to explain these findings and
that this may be due in part to improved specificity
and sensitivity of detection of psa and dre under
5-ari treatment.27 finasteride inhibits only 5-ar2,
resulting in a decrease in psa of 50%. in low-grade
cancer, the amount of 5-ar2 may still predominate;
therefore, both finasteride and dutasteride should
produce an adequate reduction in the level of psa.
by contrast, in high-grade cancers, levels of 5-ar1

the identification and characterization of somatic
5-ar mutations in human prostate cancer tissue
have implications both in the predisposition and in
the progression of prostate cancer. makridakis et al.
reported that in about 60% of prostate tumours,
somatic substitutions occur in the protein-coding
region of the  xxxg2200xxx  gene, which encodes 5-ar.
approximately 20% of tumour samples had  xxxg2200xxx 
mutations that significantly activated steroid  xxxg183xxx , while only 7% had  xxxg2200xxx  mutations
that reduced enzyme activity significantly. it is, therefore, possible that these genetic variants may play
an important role in the development and progression of bph and prostate cancer, and may help individualize cancer treatment and prevention through
pharmacogenetic mechanisms.29 further in vitro
analysis showed that dutasteride was an efficient
steroid 5-ar inhibitor for most of the enzyme variants, with the exception of p48r and f194l, and
that dutasteride treatment would also be expected
to result in lower pharmacogenetic variation in vivo
than finasteride treatment.30

castration-resistant prostate cancer
castration-resistant prostate cancer (crpc) remains
a therapeutic challenge, and it has been hypothesized that dual 5-ar inhibition may be valuable
in its management. eggener and colleagues31
reported that a combination of dutasteride, but not
finasteride, plus castration, achieved significantly
greater reductions in lncap tumour growth in
xenograft-bearing nude mice than castration alone
(p < 0.05) and that dutasteride-treated mice were
3 to 5 times more likely to be alive 70 days following treatment than those treated with finasteride.
current data suggest that the  xxxg183xxx  is
expressed and continues to mediate androgen signaling after failure of androgen deprivation therapy.
although hormone suppression treatment eliminates
the detectable levels of testosterone in the blood,
the levels in tissue remain high enough to stimulate
androgen receptors and allow both survival of
tumour cells and induction of resistance by overex-

pression of the receptor.32,33 locke and colleagues34
have shown that all enzymes necessary for androgen synthesis are expressed in prostate cancer
tumours, and some seem to be up-regulated during crpc progression, suggesting that de-novo synthesis may be a driving force behind castration
resistance. a combination of androgen deprivation
( xxxd2229xxx  with  xxxd334xxx  and/or ketoconazole)
and dual inhibition (dutasteride) could inhibit
tumour growth by reducing intracellular androgen
synthesis, and this is currently being studied at
the university of washington.33

conclusions
the enzyme 5-ar, which reduces testosterone to
dht, exists in 2 forms: type 1 and type 2.
dutasteride inhibits both, whereas finasteride
inhibits type 2 only. available data show that dutasteride, in contrast to finasteride, provides greater
suppression of dht than finasteride, is able to
shrink tumour volume quicker and more dramatically than finasteride, and is more effective against
genetic variants of 5-ar than is finasteride. thus,
the dual inhibition of 5-ar may prove more useful
in the treatment of bph in reducing the risk of prostate
cancer and in the treatment of crpc. full clinical
investigations of these and other approaches to
the inhibition of 5-ar are ongoing and results are
greatly anticipated.
