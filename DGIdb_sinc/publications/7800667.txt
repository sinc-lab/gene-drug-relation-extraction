abstract: we compared antipsychotic drugs (haloperidol, chlorpromazine and clozapine) and (i antagonists ( xxxd3096xxx ,
cinuperone, a-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-(-fluoro-2-pyrimidinyl)-l-piperazine
butanol (bmy 14802) and rimcazole) in the radioligand binding and behavioural experiments in rodents. a good correlation was established between the affinity of compounds at dopamine2-receptorsin the striatum and their ability to block apomorphine-, amphetamine- and quipazineinduced behavioural effects in rodents. by contrast, no correlation was found between the behavioural effects of these
drugs and their affinity at dopamine,-, 5-ht2-and cj receptors. the rank order of potency among the studied antipsychotic
drugs in the behavioural tests and at dopamine2-receptorswas following: haloperidol%hlorpromazine?clozapine. the
effectiveness of chlorpromazine and clozapine was nearly similar against apomorphine-induced aggressiveness and yawning, whereas at 5-ht2-receptorsclozapine was more active than chlorpromazine. the weak activity of (i antagonists at
dopamine2 receptors could be a possible reason why these compounds were less effective in the behavioural studies
compared to antipsychotic drugs. however, the antagonism of  xxxd3096xxx  against apomorphine-induced stereotypy and
aggressiveness is not related to its activity at (i receptors, because the other cj antagonists did not block these effects of
apomorphine. it is probable that  xxxd3096xxx  exerts its action through blocking of dopaminez receptors. in conclusion,
the present study revealed only weak activity of cj antagonists in the behavioural models widely used to study the antipsychotic drugs. therefore, the antipsychotic activity of (i antagonists is doubtful.

it is generally accepted that the clinical potency of antipsychotic drugs is related to their affinity at dopamine2-receptors in the striatum (seeman et al. 1976). however, the antipsychotic drugs do not interact only with dopamine2-receptors, but they also share high affinity for the other receptors
occurring in the mammalian brain (for example dopaminel,
5-ht2, muscarinic, a-adrenergic, b etc.). nevertheless, the
role of these receptors in the action of antipsychotic drugs
remains still to be established.
recently, a new group of purported antipsychotic drugs,
displaying significantly higher affinity for (t than dopamine*receptors, has been developed (largent et al. 1988). several
b antagonists, like rimcazole (ferris et al. 1986), cinuperone
(su 1986) and a-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-( -fluoro-2-pyr imidiny1)1-piperazine butanol (bmy 14802) (taylor & dekleva
1988), has been characterized in the behavioural experiments as the 'atypical' antipsychotic compounds. moreover,
the significant relationship bwteen (t receptors and dopaminergic neurones has been established in the brain
(steinfels & tam 1989). the localization of b receptors on
the mesencephalic dopamine neurones was shown in autoradiographic binding studies (graybiel et al. 1989). the administration of the b agonist (+)skf 10,047 (n-allylnormetazocine) stimulates the activity of dopamine cells in the

ventral tegmental area (freeman & bunney 1984). rimcazole, an antagonist of cf receptors, effectively antagonizes
(+)skf 10,047-induced excitation of dopamine neurones
(ceci et al. 1988). in addition, long-term treatment with the
selective cjantagonist bmy 14802, like that of the 'atypical'
antipsychotic drug clozapine, reduces the number of spontaneously active dopamine cells in the ventral tegmental
area without affecting the activity of dopamine cells in the
substantia nigra (wachtel &white 1988).
considering the possible antipsychotic activity of b antagonists, in the present study, an attempt was done to compare the effects of various clinically effective antipsychotic
drugs (haloperidol, chlorpromazine, clozapine) with that of
the preferential b antagonists (rimcazole,  xxxd3096xxx , cinuperone, bmy 14802). the first part of experiments was
dedicated to reveal the interaction of all these drugs with
dopaminel-, dopamine2-, 5-ht2- and b receptors, because
all these receptors were shown to be involved to some extent
in the action of various antipsychotic drugs. simultaneously
with the radioligand experiments, the behavioural studies
were employed. the action of antipsychotic drugs and b
antagonists was studied upon the behavioural effects of
drugs interacting with dopamine- and 5-ht-receptors (apomorphine-induced climbing and amphetamine-induced
hypermotility in mice, apomorphine-induced aggressiveness, stereotypy and yawning behaviour, and quipazine-induced head-twitches in rats). the selection of these behavioural models was motivated by the wide use of these behavi-

variance from antipsychotic compounds the ic50 values of
cr antagonists ( xxxd3096xxx , bmy 14802 and rimcazole)
against [3h]-spiperone binding were in micromolar range.
an exception among cr antagonists was cinuperone, which
was a potent inhibitor of [3h]-spiperone binding (ic50=76
nm) to dopaminez-receptors in the present experiments.
the antipsychotic drugs haloperidol, chlorpromazine
and clozapine displayed only moderate affinity at dopaminel receptors (ic50=210-400 nm) labeled with [3h]sch 23390 (table 1). high concentrations of cinuperone,
bmy 14802,  xxxd3096xxx  and rimcazole (>lo pm) were
needed to block [3h]-sch 23390 binding at dopaminel- receptors. most of tested compounds (haloperidol, chlorpromazine,  xxxd3096xxx , cinuperone, bmy 14802, rimcazole) were more effective at dopamine2- than at dopaminelreceptors, the only exception was clozapine having nearly
similar affinity at both dopamine receptors.
the studying of drug potencies at cr receptors showed the
inability of clozapine to inhibit the specific binding of [3h]haloperidol to cr receptors in the cerebellum up to the concentration of 10 pm, whereas all the other tested compounds had ic50 values less than 300 nm (table 1). again,
haloperidol was by far the most potent antagonist (ic5,=
1.1 nm) of [3h]-haloperidol binding to cr receptors in the
rat cerebellum.  xxxd3096xxx , bmy 14802, rimcazole and
cinuperone were apparently more potent at b receptors
compared to the other receptors studied.
chlorpromazine and clozapine displayed a significant affinity at 5-ht2-receptors labeled with [3h]- xxxd2419xxx  (table
1). haloperidol and cinuperone exerted moderate activity
at these 5-ht-receptors (icso values 200 and 240 nm, respectively), whereas the remaining compounds had ic50
values higher than 10 pm.
the ed50values of drugs against the behavioural effects
of apomorphine, amphetamine and quipazine are presented
in table 2. generally, a typical antipsychotic drug haloperidol was the most effective antagonist in all behavioural experiments done. chlorpromazine, clozapine and  xxxd3096xxx  were less effective if compared to haloperidol. the rank
order of potency of these drugs in the behavioural studies
was following: halo per idol > xxxd3096xxx >chlorpromazine
sclozapine.  xxxd3096xxx  was more effective in the behavioural tests where dopamine agonists apomorphine and am-

phetamine were used. differently from haloperidol and
chlorpromazine it was more selective antagonist of apomorphine-induced aggressiveness compared to stereotyped
behaviour. the comparison of chlorpromazine and clozapine revealed that chlorpromazine was stronger antagonist of
apomorphine-induced climbing and sterotypy, and amphetamine-induced hypermotility. clozapine did not block apomorphine-induced stereotypy, but by variance from the
other antipsychotic drugs even increased the intensity of
this behaviour. chlorpromazine and clozapine had nearly
similar effectiveness against apomorphine-induced aggressiveness and yawning behaviour, whereas in the case of quipazine-induced head twitches clozapine was two times more
potent than chlorpromazine. the later finding was in correlation with their affinity for 5-ht2-receptors labeled by
[3h]- xxxd2419xxx  (table 1).
the comparison of cr antagonists and antipsychotic compounds revealed a big difference between these compounds.
in general, much higher doses of cr antagonists (cinuperone,
bmy 14802 and rimcazole) were needed to block the above
described behavioural effects of apomorphine, amphetamine and quipazine. furthermore, the preferential c antagonists (cinuperone, bmy 14802 and rimcazole) did not
antagonize apomorphine-induced sterotypy and aggressiveness in the rat.
the correlation was established between the affinity of
drugs at dopaminez-receptors and their effectiveness in the
various behavioural studies (the correlation coefficients
0.65-0.93, p<0.05). no correlation was found between the
behavioural effects and affinity of drugs at the other receptors (the correlation coefficients less than 0.30, p>o.l).

discussion
the present study revealed clear evidence that the potency
of antipsychotic drugs and cr antagonists in various behavioural tests correlated with their affinity at dopamine2-receptors. no correlation has been established between the affinity of drugs at dopamine,-, 5ht2- and c receptors and their
action against apomorphine-, amphetamine- and quipazine-induced behaviours. fritz et al. (1993) were also unable
to establish the correlation between ability of drugs to block

results are presented as edsovalues (pmoykg) of compounds and confidence limits for them. the doses of compounds completely blocking
the behaviour are shown in the case of apomorphine-induced stereotyped gnawing and aggressiveness.

apomorphine-induced climbing and their potency at o receptors. haloperidol, a widely used antipsychotic drug, was
the most potent compound to inhibit ['hi-spiperone binding at dopamine2-receptors in the rat striatum and it also
displayed the highest effectiveness in the behavioural
studies. indeed, haloperidol was very potent at o receptors
in the cerebellum, but haloperidol appears to be an agonist
of o receptors. it was established that long-term treatment
with haloperidol induced the down-regulation of o receptors in the mouse and rat brain (itzhak & alerhand 1989;
kizu et al. 1991), whereas several o antagonists (rimcazole,
bmy 14802) caused the opposite effect (manallack & beart
1988; lang et a. 1992). thus, it is very unlikely that the
current behavioural effects of haloperidol are related to the
blockade of c receptors.
chlorpromazine and clozapine were less active at dopamine2-receptors and they were less effective against apomorphine-, amphetamine- and quipazine-induced behavioural effects compared to haloperidol. the rank order of
potency of antipsychotic drugs at dopamine2-receptors and
in the behavioural studies was as follows: haloperidol*
chlorpromazinezclozapine. however, it should be noted
that clozapine instead of blocking of apomorphine-induced
stereotypy even potentiated the intensity of this behaviour.
nevertheless, clozapine and chlorpromazine had nearly
similar effectiveness against apomorphine-induced aggressiveness and yawning in rats. however, it is worthy to stress
that clozapine is clinically more effective antipsychotic compound compared to chlorpromazine (kane et al. 1988). recently, very high affinity ot' clozapine at one subpopulation
of dopamine2-receptor family was established. namely, clozapine displayed a significant activity for dopamine4-receptors (van to1 et al. 1991). the marked potency of clozapine
and chlorpromazine at 5-ht2-receptors should be also
mentioned. however, clozapine was more potent than
chlorpromazine to inhibit ['hi- xxxd2419xxx  binding to 5ht2-

receptors in the rat frontal cortex and to block quipazineinduced head twitches. by variance from haloperidol and
chlorpromazine, clozapine did not interact with o receptors.
however, there is some evidence that clozapine can affect
in some indirect way the function of n-methyl-d-aspartate
receptor channels (tiedtke et al. 1990; lang et al. 1992).
in general, the preferential g antagonists were apparently
less effective than antipsychotic drugs to antagonize the behavioural effects of apomorphine, amphetamine and quipazine. nevertheless, there is a growing body of evidence
about the functional interaction of o receptors and dopaminergic neurones. indeed, the high density of o receptors
has been described on the mesencephalic dopaminergic cells
(graybiel et al. 1989). in addition, the administration of
(r agonists increased the electrical activity of dopaminergic
neurones (freeman & bunney 1984; ceci et al. 1988;
french & ceci 1990) and facilitated the release of dopamine
(patrick et al. 1993). the o agonist-induced increase of electrical activity of dopamine neurones was potently antagonized by the selective o antagonist rimcazole (ceci et al.
1988). the preferential o antagonist bmy 14802 is shown
to inhibit dose-dependently the neostriatal motor-dependent neurones in freely moving rats (wang et al. 1992). according to the present study the preferential o antagonists
were effective against apomorphine-induced yawning and
climbing, amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion and quipazine-induced head twitches. however, only  xxxd3096xxx 
blocked apomorphine-induced stereotyped behaviour and
aggressiveness, whereas the other o antagonists were completely ineffective. in the radioligand binding studies  xxxd3096xxx  had nearly tenfold preference for (r receptors compared to dopamine2-receptors. recent evidence suggests
that  xxxd3096xxx  is an apparently more potent drug at dopamine2-receptors than it was established in the present
study. indeed, the affinity of  xxxd3096xxx  against ['hl-raclopride, a highly selective antagonist of dopamine2-receptors,

226

a. lang et ai.

was 10 times higher than in our present study, because ki
value for  xxxd3096xxx  in this experiment was 113 nm
(mohell et al. 1993). the presence of metabolites of  xxxd3096xxx  having moderate affinity for dopamine2-receptors
could be also a possible explanation for the marked activity
of  xxxd3096xxx  in the behavioural experiments (mohell et
al. 1993). the statement about the significant activity of
 xxxd3096xxx  at dopamine2-receptors is in good accordance
with results of kohler et al. (1990). in contrast to classical
antipsychotic drugs  xxxd3096xxx  is more potent at preventing of [3h]-spiperone in vivo binding to dopamine2-receptors in certain mesolimbic structures and other extrastriatal
brain areas compared to its effects on striatal binding
(kiihler et al. 1990). the higher potency of  xxxd3096xxx 
against apomorphine-induced aggressiveness compared to
stereotyped behaviour seems also to be related to its higher
selectivity for limbic dopamine2-receptors. the site of action of the other cs antagonists upon the behavioural effects
of apomorphine, amphetamine and quipazine is less clear.
however, at least two mechanisms should be considered.
first, by blocking o receptors at dopamine cells they could
decrease the activity of these neurones. second, the direct
interaction of cs antagonists with dopamine2-receptors
should not be neglected either, because all these drugs (cinuperone, bmy 14802 and rimcazole) possessed some activity
at dopamine2-receptors in the radioligand binding experiments.
it is difficult to explain why cinuperone, having a considerable affinity at dopaminerreceptors in in vitro binding
studies, displayed weak activity in the behavioural experiments. however, one could speculate that the poor penetration of cinuperone through the blood-brain barrier would
be a possible reason. rimcazole was an effective antagonist
of apomorphine-induced aggressiveness in earlier studies
(ferris et al. 1982), but we were unable to confirm this finding in the present study. this discrepancy could be explained in the light of different use of apomorphine, namely
that ferris et al. (1982) induced aggressiveness by acute injection of high dose of apomorphine, whereas in the present
work the animals were sensitized to aggressive behaviour by
two weeks pretreatment with apomorphine. probably, the
repeated dosing of apomorphine induced the hypersensitivity of dopamine receptors (allikmets & vasar 1982), and
after that rimcazole, as weak antagonist of dopamine2-receptors, was not able to block apomorphine-induced aggressiveness.
in conclusion, the present study revealed only weak activity of o antagonists in behavioural models widely used for
the study of antipsychotic drugs in rodents. therefore, the
antipsychotic activity of cs antagonists is doubtful. this
pessimistic view is in accordance with the recent clinical
studies where rimcazole, by contrast from  xxxd3096xxx  (den
boer et al. 1990), did not show any considerable antipsychotic action in schizophrenic patients (borison et al. 1991).
however, the data of our experiments favour the existing
view that the blockade of dopamine2-receptors is a common
feature in the action of antipsychotic drugs.
