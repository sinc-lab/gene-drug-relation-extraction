abstract
n-[3-(1h-imidazol-4-ylmethyl)phenyl]ethanesulfonamide, maleate (abt-866) is a novel a1-adrenoceptor agent with mixed
pharmacological properties in vitro. compared to phenylephrine, abt-866 demonstrates intrinsic activity at the a1a-adrenoceptor subtype
present in the rabbit urethra (pd2 = 6.22, with 80% of the phenylephrine response), reduced intrinsic activity at the a1b-adrenoceptor subtype
in the rat spleen (pd2 = 6.16, with 11% of the phenylephrine response), and no intrinsic activity at the rat aorta a1d-adrenoceptor subtype.
abt-866 also demonstrated antagonism at the rat spleen a1b-adrenoceptor (pa2 = 5.39 f 0.08, slope = 1.20 f 0.12), and the rat aorta a1dadrenoceptor (pa2 = 6.18 f 0.09, slope = 0.96 f 0.13). this is in contrast to the weak non-selective activity seen with the a1-adrenoceptor
agonist,  xxxd2921xxx  (2-amino-1-phenyl- xxxd3026xxx  hydrochloride), and the a1a/d-adrenoceptor selective agonist 1-(2v,5vdimethoxyphenyl)-2- xxxd102xxx  hydrochloride (st-1059), the active metabolite of midodrine, that has been used clinically for the
treatment of stress urinary incontinence. this study identifies a unique agent that may prove to be a valuable in vivo tool in testing the
hypothesis that the a1a-adrenoceptor can be stimulated to contract the smooth muscle present in the urethra without evoking blood pressure
elevations presumably caused by a1b- and a1d-adrenoceptor subtype involvements in the vasculature.

1. introduction
adrenergic nerves have been identified in human urethral
smooth muscle tissue (ek et al., 1977a; brading et al.,
1999). it has also been demonstrated that a1-adrenoceptor
antagonists inhibit while agonists increase urethral tone (ek
et al., 1977b; donker et al., 1972; fossberg et al., 1983;
ahlstrom et al., 1990). a rational basis for the treatment of
stress urinary incontinence with a1-adrenoceptor agonists
has been demonstrated clinically using  xxxd2921xxx  (collste and lindskog, 1987) and midodrine (jonas,
1977; weil et al., 1998; andersson et al., 1983). however,
both agents have met with limited success in the pharmacological treatment of stress urinary incontinence, due in part
to the undesirable cardiovascular effects of non-selective a1adrenoceptor stimulation.

the recent introduction of the selective a1a-adrenoceptor
antagonist tamsulosin for the treatment of benign prostatic
hyperplasia has shown that a1a-adrenoceptors are the major
a1-adrenoceptor subtype responsible for lower urinary tract
function (de mey, 1998). with regards to the role of other
adrenoceptors, results from mice deficient in a1b-adrenoceptor show a reduced blood pressure response to exogenous stimulation indicating an important role for the a1badrenoceptor subtype in the control of hemodynamic events
(cavalli et al., 1997). recently, a potential role for the a1dadrenoceptor subtype in modulating bladder filling symptoms associated with detrusor instability was suggested
(schwinn and michelotti, 2000). it was also reported that
the a1d-adrenoceptor subtype was up regulated in response
to bladder outlet obstruction in rats, a laboratory model of
urge urinary incontinence (hampel et al., 2000).
we report here on the novel in vitro effects of abt-866

2. materials and methods
this manuscript adheres to the nomenclature for adrenergic receptors as suggested by bylund et al. (1994) and
hieble et al. (1995). all studies were carried out in accordance with guidelines outlined by the animal welfare act,
the association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animals and the institutional animal care and use
committee of abbott laboratories.
2.1. radioligand binding assays
radioligand binding at the adrenergic receptor sites was
performed according to knepper et al. (1995). briefly, the
cdna encoding bovine a1a, rat a1d (lomasney et al.,
1991) and hamster a1b (cotecchia et al., 1988) receptors
were obtained from triangle universities licensing consortium (research triangle park, nc), expressed in mouse
fibroblast cells (ltk ) and membranes prepared and
frozen at
70 jc until time of assay. receptor binding
assays were performed using the method of greengrass and
bremner (1979). this protocol employed 1 ml final volumes
in 50 mm tris – hcl using 0.8 mg wet weight of cloned
receptor membranes with 0.2 nm [3h] xxxd3000xxx  in the
presence and absence of various competing compounds.
non-specific binding was defined in the presence of 10 am
 xxxd2914xxx . subtype selective a2a-adrenoceptor radioligand binding was performed according to the method of
uhlen and wikberg (1991).
animals were euthanized by means of an intraperitoneal
injection of pentobarbital solution, at a lethal dose of 200
mg/kg fatal-plusr (vortech pharmaceuticals, dearborn,
mi). tissues were immediately excised and placed in

the urethra was removed from female new zealand
white rabbits (1.75 – 3.75 kg) along with the urinary bladder
attached and immediately placed into oxygenated krebs–
henseleit bicarbonate solution. the urethra was separated
from the bladder and the proximal end cut into 4 tissue rings
approximately 2– 3 mm wide. the urethra ring was attached
to a stationary glass rod and a grass ft03 transducer at a
basal preload of 1.0 g. data were recorded on a grass
model-7 polygraph. tissues were rinsed every 10 min for a
total of 75 min. the urethra was exposed to 80 mm
 xxxd2988xxx , rinsed to basal tension and again with
10 am phenylephrine. these two preliminary exposures
made subsequent exposure to the test agents more reproducible. after an additional 60-min equilibration period, a
reference concentration response curve was generated for
each tissue using phenylephrine as the reference agonist. a
cumulative concentration response (10 nm –3 mm) protocol
was employed. following a 75-min washout period, a
second response curve was then generated in the same
fashion using the test agent. each tissue was used for only
one test agonist.
2.3. rat spleen a1b-adrenoceptor protocol
the entire spleen was removed from male sprague –
dawley rats (150 – 200 g), split longitudinally into two
preparations per rat and mounted as described above (han
et al., 1987; burt et al., 1992). a phenylephrine concentration response curve was generated in a cumulative fashion, the tissues rinsed for 90 min and a second concentration
response curve (10 nm – 1 mm) generated for the test agent.
for determining the antagonist potency of abt-866, the test
agent was allowed a 45-min exposure time before a second
phenylephrine response curve was generated in the presence
of the antagonist. the individual tissues were exposed to
only one concentration of test antagonist.
2.4. rat aorta a1d-adrenoceptor protocol
the method used was as described by buckner et al.,
1996. briefly, the thoracic aorta was removed from male
sprague – dawley rats (350 – 450 g), cleaned of extraneous
tissue, and the endothelium removed by passing a 100-mm
length of polyethylene-160 tubing through the lumen. the
aorta was cut into 3- to 4-mm rings and mounted in 10-ml
isolated tissue baths as described above. absence of functional endothelium was confirmed by loss of the 10 am

acetylcholine-induced relaxations of 10 am phenylephrineinduced contractions. a phenylephrine concentration
response curve (1 nm –1 mm) was generated in a cumulative fashion, the tissues rinsed for 90 min and a second
concentration response curve generated for the test agent.
antagonist potency was determined as described above.
2.5. rat vas deferens a2a-adrenoceptor protocol
the entire vas deferens was removed from male
sprague – dawley rats (350 – 450 g) and the epididymal
portion discarded (connaughton and docherty, 1990). the
prostatic portion was cut in a helical fashion and mounted
between two platinum electrodes. one end was fixed to the
stationary end of the electrode and the other to a grass
instruments ft03 transducer at a basal preload of 0.5 g and
placed in a 10-ml isolated tissue bath at 37 jc. the tissues
were stimulated with a grass instruments s88 stimulator
combined with a voltage – current stabilizing amplifier
(mayo clinic). the stimulating parameters were: 0.1 hz
frequency, 25 v (supramaximal) with duration of 1.0 ms.
current was limited to 140 ma. this stimulation produced a
rapid, biphasic contractile twitch that became reproducible
and monophasic after approximately 15 min. the stimulus
was applied for the duration of the agonist response curve.
cumulative concentrations of clonidine were used as a
reference agonist producing a concentration-dependent
reduction in the stimulated twitch response that resulted in
complete cessation of the contractions. when the contractions were reduced to zero, the stimulus was stopped and the
tissues thoroughly rinsed for 90 min  xxxd1891xxx -ml intervals. the
concentration response curve (10 pm –300 am) was then
repeated using the test agonist. experimental protocol and
data analysis performed as described above.
2.6. drugs and chemicals
n-[3-(1h-imidazol-4-ylmethyl)phenyl]ethanesulfonamide, maleate (abt-866); 1-(2v,5v-dimethoxyphenyl)-2aminoethanol hydrochloride (st-1059); and  xxxd2921xxx  hcl, 2-amino-1-phenyl- xxxd3026xxx  hydrochloride;
were synthesized at abbott laboratories (abbott park, il).

161

 xxxd2920xxx , ( f )-propranolol hcl,  xxxd3000xxx  hcl, and
clonidine hcl were purchased from sigma (st. louis, mo).

2.7. data analysis
concentration response curves were analyzed using a
four-parameter curve fitting routine, described previously
(zielinski and buckner, 1998). the maximum peak amplitude response was used for analysis. results were expressed
as g of tension and as a percentage of maximum response.
potencies were expressed as pd2, the negative log10 (ec50
or ic50). differences in (ec50 or ic50) values were calculated by analysis of variance (anova), followed by fisher’s probabilistic least significance difference (plsd) test
for significance. schild analysis was used to determine the
antagonist potency and is expressed as pa2 (schild, 1947).

3. results
3.1. radioligand binding
abt-866 exhibited nanomolar affinity for the a1a-adrenoceptor expressed in the bovine clonal cell line (pki = 6.79;
table 1) and similar affinities for the rat clonal a1d,
pki = 6.55, and the human clonal a2a-adrenoceptor subtypes, pk i = 6.76. abt-866 showed weaker affinity
( p < 0.0001) for the hamster clonal a1b, pki = 6.06.
 xxxd2921xxx  was 55-fold weaker than abt-866
at the a1a-adrenoceptor subtype ( p < 0.05), as indicated by
a pki = 5.05.  xxxd2921xxx  showed no a1a-adrenoceptor subtype selectivity with binding affinities, a1b –
pk i = 5.02, and a1d – pk i = 5.07.  xxxd2921xxx 
exhibited 32-fold greater affinity for the a2a-adrenoceptor,
pki = 6.56 versus the a1a-adrenoceptor subtype ( p < 0.005).
compared to abt-866, the radioligand binding affinity
of st-1059 was significantly weaker for the a1a-adrenoceptor subtype, pki = 5.89, p < 0.0001. st-1059, however,
showed weaker affinity for the a1b-adrenoceptor subtype,
pki = 5.16 ( p < 0.001), than seen at the a1a-adrenoceptor
subtype. compared to its affinity at the a1a-adrenoceptor,
st-1059 was non-selective in its affinity for the a1d- and

that phenylephrine is preferentially an a1d-adrenoceptor
subtype agonist.
3.2. isolated tissue bath assays
phenylephrine was employed as a reference agent for the
a1-adrenoceptor assays. the maximum contractions evoked
by phenylephrine were 5.65 f 0.61, 0.37 f 0.002, and
1.12 f 0.07 g for the rabbit urethra a1a, rat spleen a1b
and rat aorta a1d-adrenoceptor subtypes, respectively. clonidine, an a2a-adrenoceptor agonist, was used as a reference
compound for the field-stimulated vas deferens and
inhibited the field-stimulated twitch from 0.71 f 0.14 g to
complete inhibition of contractions.

(schwinn and michelotti, 2000). abt-866 contracted the
rabbit urethra with a potency pd2 = 6.22 f 0.05 and intrinsic
activity 80% of the tension evoked by phenylephrine (fig. 2,
table 2). the contractions evoked by abt-866 were blocked
by  xxxd3000xxx  in a competitive fashion (pa2 = 8.34 f 0.14,
n = 12), with parallel shifts of the concentration response
curve, no reduction in maximum response and a schild slope
(1.06 f 0.04) not different from unity (fig. 3).
3.4. rat spleen a1b
in contrast to the robust intrinsic activity produced by
abt-866 in the rabbit urethra, abt-866 showed only 11%
intrinsic activity ( p < 0.001) relative to phenylephrine at the
a1b-adrenoceptor subtype expressed in the rat spleen (fig.
4a, table 2). due to the minimal activity of abt-866 in this
assay it was retested as an antagonist. abt-866 antagonized
the contractions evoked by phenylephrine in the rat spleen
with a pa2 value of 5.39 f 0.08, slope = 1.20 f 0.12, n = 18
(fig. 5). in this assay,  xxxd2921xxx  and st-1059
exhibited 34% and 68% intrinsic activity relative to phenylephrine, respectively.

4. discussion
in the current study, the relative affinities at the a1aadrenoceptor subtype were abt-866 > st-1059> xxxd2921xxx , p < 0.0001 and p < 0.05, respectively. abt-866
exhibited 55-fold greater affinity for the a1a-adrenoceptor
subtype than  xxxd2921xxx . abt-866 also showed 5fold radioligand binding selectivity for the a1a-adrenoceptor
subtype over the a1b-adrenoceptor subtype ( p < 0.0001);
however, no differences were seen in the affinities at the
a1a-, a1d-, or a2a-adrenoceptor subtypes.  xxxd2921xxx  exhibited 32-fold greater affinity for the a2a-adrenoceptor subtype than seen for the a1a -adrenoceptor
( p < 0.005) and no a1-adrenoceptor subtype selectivity. st1059 exhibited 5-fold weaker affinity at the a1b-adrenoceptor
subtype compared to its affinity at the a1a-adrenoceptor
subtype ( p < 0.05). st-1059 was non-selective in its affinity
for the a1a-, a1d- and a2a-adrenoceptor subtypes. phenylephrine exhibited selectivity for the a1d-adrenoceptor subtypes with relative affinities (a1d>(a1a = a1b)) p < 0.05.
it has been suggested that the resting urethral tone in the
rabbit and human are in part maintained by stimulation of
the a1a-adrenoceptor subtype (morita et al., 1993; testa et
al., 1993). this concept has been supported clinically by the
success of  xxxd2921xxx  (ahlstrom et al., 1990;
collste and lindskog, 1987) and st-1059 in alleviating
the symptoms of stress urinary incontinence. these agents
however have met with limited success due to the negative
cardiovascular side effects.
the radioligand binding affinity for abt-866 at the a1aadrenoceptor subtype was expressed functionally in the
rabbit urethra a1a as a potent agonist with intrinsic activity
slightly weaker than phenylephrine p < 0.050. the  xxxd3000xxx 
shift of the abt-866 concentration response curve would
suggest that abt-866 is a competitive agonist. the affinities
for the a1b- and a1d-adrenoceptor subtypes were expressed
functionally as agonism/antagonism at the rat spleen a1b
and as antagonism at the rat aorta a1d-adrenoceptor subtype. this was in contrast to the functional agonism
expressed by  xxxd2921xxx  and st-1059 at all three
a1-adrenoceptor subtypes. all three agents were agonists at
the a2a rat vas deferens and inhibited the field stimulated
twitch response. abt-866 showed weak intrinsic activity
with 34% of the response seen with clonidine.  xxxd2921xxx  showed similar potency to abt-866, but
with greater intrinsic activity, whereas st-1059 was a potent
agonist with limited intrinsic activity (20% of the response
to phenylephrine).
non-selective a1-adrenoceptor agonists have demonstrated limited clinical utility due to adverse cardiovascular
effects (jonas, 1977; fossberg et al., 1983; collste and
lindskog, 1987; weil et al., 1998). an improved pharmacological profile for an agent designed to increase lower
urinary tract resistance may be realized with agonists that
possess greater a1a-adrenoceptor subtype selectivity over
the a1b/d-adrenoceptor subtypes, like a-61603, or an agent

with mixed pharmacology showing a1a-adrenoceptor agonism and functional antagonism at the a1b/d-adrenoceptor
subtypes, like abt-866. currently, highly selective a1aadrenoceptor agonists such as a-61603 do not have sufficient therapeutic index to eliminate subtype specific cardiovascular effects as demonstrated with in vivo models in the
dog (knepper et al., 1995). therefore, as a1b- and a1dadrenoceptor antagonists exhibit antihypertensive effects, a
combination of a1a-adrenoceptor agonism and a1b/d-adrenoceptor antagonism may prove beneficial in treating lower
urinary tract leakage. the pharmacological profile of abt866 offers a means of testing such a hypothesis.
