abstract
 xxxg1294xxx  (gtk), which is a freely reversible glutamine (methionine) aromatic amino acid aminotransferase, is present
in most mammalian tissues, including brain. quantitatively, the most important amine donor in vivo is glutamine. the product of glutamine
transamination (i.e., ␣-ketoglutaramate; ␣kgm) is rapidly removed by cyclization and/or conversion to ␣-ketoglutarate. transamination
is therefore “pulled” in the direction of glutamine utilization. major biological roles of gtk are to maintain low levels of  xxxd2922xxx 
and to close the methionine salvage pathway. gtk also catalyzes the transamination of cystathionine, lanthionine, and thialysine to the
corresponding ␣-keto acids, which cyclize to ketimines. the cyclic ketimines and several metabolites derived therefrom are found in
brain. it is not clear whether these compounds have a biological function or are metabolic dead-ends. however, high-affinity binding of
lanthionine ketimine (lk) to brain membranes has been reported.
mammalian tissues possess several enzymes capable of catalyzing transamination of kynurenine in vitro. two of these kynurenine
aminotransferases (kats), namely kat i and kat ii, are present in brain and have been extensively studied. kat i and kat ii are
identical to gtk and ␣- xxxg3xxx , respectively. gtk/kat i is largely cytosolic in kidney, but mostly mitochondrial
in brain. the same gene codes for both forms, but alternative splicing dictates whether a 32-amino acid mitochondrial-targeting sequence
is present in the expressed protein. the activity of kat i is altered by a missense mutation (e61g) in the spontaneously hypertensive rat.
the symptoms may be due in part to alteration of kynurenine transamination. however, owing to strong competition from other amino
acid substrates, the turnover of kynurenine to kynurenate by gtk/kat i in nervous tissue must be slow unless kynurenine and gtk are
sequestered in a compartment distinct from the major amino acid pools. the possibility is discussed that the spontaneous hypertension in
rats carrying the gtk/kat i mutation may be due in part to disruption of glutamine transamination.
gtk is one of several pyridoxal 5 -phosphate (plp)-containing enzymes that can catalyze non-physiological ␤-elimination reactions
with cysteine s-conjugates containing a good leaving group attached at the sulfur. these elimination reactions may contribute to the
bioactivation of certain electrophiles, resulting in toxicity to kidney, liver, brain, and possibly other organs. on the other hand, the ␤-lyase
reaction catalyzed by gtk may be useful in the conversion of some cysteine s-conjugate prodrugs to active components in vivo.
the roles of gtk in (a) brain nitrogen, sulfur, and aromatic amino acid/kynurenine metabolism, (b) brain ␣-keto acid metabolism, (c)
bioactivation of certain electrophiles in brain, (d) prodrug targeting, and (e) maintenance of normal blood pressure deserve further study.

1. historical
more than 55 years ago, greenstein and carter (1947)
discovered that rat liver homogenates contain a phosphateactivated  xxxg907xxx  and an apparent pyruvate-activated
 xxxg907xxx . the enzymes were named  xxxg908xxx  and ii,
respectively. subsequently,  xxxg908xxx  was found to occur
in two isozymic forms, namely  xxxg907xxx  k and  xxxg907xxx  l. these enzymes have been cloned, sequenced and
their metabolic importance well documented (e.g., curthoys,
2001; watford et al., 2002). in the early 1950s, meister and co-workers (meister et al., 1952; meister, 1953)
showed that  xxxg907xxx  ii is actually a composite of two
enzymes, namely glutamine transaminase and ␻-amidase
(eqs. (1)–(3); fig. 1).

transaminase k (gtk).1 the enzyme is most active in kidney, but substantial gtk activity is present in liver and other
organs, including brain (cooper, 1988; cooper and meister,
1974, 1981; cooper and gross, 1977). glutamine, methionine, and phenylalanine (and some other aromatic amino
acids) are excellent amino acid substrates; ␣kgm, ␣kmb
and  xxxd2922xxx  are excellent ␣-keto acid substrates.
therefore, gtk may be regarded as a freely reversible
glutamine (methionine) aromatic amino acid aminotransferase. a widely used gtk assay measures transamination
between l-phenylalanine and ␣kmb (cooper, 1978a).
most studies of glutamine transamination have been carried out with the rat. however, tracer studies with l-[15 n]
glutamate, l-[2-15 n]glutamine, and l-[5-15 n]glutamine administered to healthy adults indicated that transamination is
a substantial pathway for glutamine metabolism in humans
(darmaun et al., 1986).

(3)

glutamine transaminase partially purified from rat liver
exhibited a broad ␣-keto acid specificity. meister and colleagues (meister, 1953; otani and meister, 1957) showed
that the ␣-keto acid derived from transamination of glutamine, namely ␣-ketoglutaramate (␣kgm) cyclizes to
a lactam (5-hydroxy-2- xxxd3052xxx , fig. 1). later, hersh
(1971, 1972) reported that at neutral ph the equilibrium
favors the ring form (99.7%) over the open-chain form
(0.3%). conversion between the two forms is specific-base
catalyzed (hersh, 1971). below ph 8.0, the rate of ring
opening limits the ␻-amidase reaction. however, at ph 8.0
or above, the rate of ring opening is no longer limiting for
the ␻-amidase reaction (hersh, 1971). as a result of ␣kgm
cyclization, the early experiments were not sensitive enough
to demonstrate the reversibility of the glutamine transaminase reaction. however, by using 14 c-labeled glutamine as
the amine donor and ␣kgm as the amine acceptor, cooper
and meister (1972) showed that the glutamine transamination reaction is freely reversible.
cooper and meister (1972) purified a glutamine transaminase (later designated as glutamine transaminase l, gtl)
from rat liver to homogeneity. the most active ␣-keto
acid substrate of this enzyme is ␣-keto-␥-methiolbutyrate
(␣kmb, the ␣-keto analogue of methionine) (cooper
and meister, 1972, 1981). gtl may be regarded as a
freely reversible glutamine methionine aminotransferase.
 xxxd2922xxx  is a poor substrate. in the rat, the enzyme is
largely confined to liver (cooper, 1988). there is little gtl
activity in brain (cooper and meister, 1981). cooper and
meister (1974) also reported that rat kidney contains a distinct glutamine transaminase, which they named glutamine

2. gtk is identical to kynurenine aminotransferase
i (kat i)
kynurenate is formed by the irreversible transamination
of kynurenine with an ␣-keto acid substrate. kynurenate
binds to ionotropic glutamate receptors and may be important in modulating a number of neuronal insults (mosca
et al., 2003, and references cited therein). brain kynurenine/kynurenate metabolism appears to be altered in huntington disease and other neurodegenerative diseases (e.g.,
beal et al., 1990; jauch et al., 1995). because kynurenine
and kynurenate may play a role in normal brain neurotransmitter function (schwarcz et al., 1992), and the levels of
these aromatic compounds are altered in neurodegenerative
disease, the kynurenate pathway may be a target for clinical
interventions (schwarcz and pellicciari, 2002). thus, it is
important to define the transamination pathway for kynurenate formation from kynurenine in brain.
some confusion existed in the earlier literature regarding the number and identity of kat enzymes. eventually,
however, kido (1991, and references cited therein) showed
that rat liver homogenates contain at least four enzymes
capable of catalyzing transamination of kynurenine with a
suitable ␣-keto acid. these enzymes were identified as (1)
gtk (kat i), (2) ␣- xxxg3xxx  (kat
ii) (cf., tobes and mason, 1977; takeuchi et al., 1983), (3)
 xxxg102xxx  ii, and (4) mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase. two of these enzymes
(kat i and kat ii) are present in rat and human brain and
have been extensively studied (e.g., okuno et al., 1991).
1 enzymes catalyzing amine transfer from an amino acid to an ␣-keto
acid are nowadays usually referred to as aminotransferases. however, the
use of the older term transaminase (cooper and meister, 1974) in the name
gtk has been retained in the literature. most aminotransferases (but not
gtl or gtk) effectively utilize the glutamate/␣kg pair as substrates.
perhaps the name  xxxg1294xxx  serves as a reminder that
gtk is not a typical aminotransferase.

fig. 1. the  xxxg907xxx  ii pathway. the pathway consists of glutamine transaminase (gtk or gtl) and ␻-amidase. although the transamination reaction
is freely reversible, the reaction is “pulled” in the direction of glutamine utilization as a result of cyclization of ␣-ketoglutaramate (␣kgm) and conversion
of ␣kgm to ␣-ketoglutarate (␣kg) by ␻-amidase. gtl and gtk are isozymes of glutamine transaminase. gtl is found predominantly in the liver.
gtk is most active in kidney but is present in other tissues including brain.

the ph optimum of kat i with pyruvate as ␣-keto acid
substrate is ∼9.5–10. the ph optimum for kat ii is ∼7.0
(okuno et al., 1990, 1991; guidetti et al., 1997). under
optimal assay conditions, the specific activities of highly
purified rat kidney gtk with kynurenine, glutamine, and
phenylalanine are ∼22 ␮mol/(h mg) (alberati-giani et al.,
1995), ∼300 ␮mol/(h mg) (cooper and meister, 1981),
and ∼140 ␮mol/(h mg) (cooper and meister, 1981), respectively. kat i and kat ii in brain homogenates may
be distinguished in part by their different ph optima and
different ␣-keto acid specificities, and by the selective
inhibition of kat i by glutamine. ␣-ketoglutarate is a relatively good ␣-keto acid substrate of kat ii, but much less
so of kat i. kat i activity with ␣-ketoglutarate is low
(vmax ∼ 1% that exhibited with pyruvate), but the affinity
for ␣-ketoglutarate is greater than that for pyruvate (i.e., the
km for ␣-ketoglutarate is smaller than that for pyruvate)
(alberati-giani et al., 1995; guidetti et al., 1997). on the
other hand, pyruvate is a good ␣-keto acid substrate of both
kat i and kat ii (e.g., guidetti et al., 1997). rat kidney
␣- xxxg3xxx /kat ii has been cloned
and sequenced (buchli et al., 1995). more recently, the rat,
mouse and human kat ii genes have been identified (goh
et al., 2002, and references cited therein).
quantitatively, the major function of ␣-aminoadipate
aminotransferase/kat ii is to convert ␣-aminoadipate to
␣-ketoadipate during lysine and tryptophan catabolism
(okuno et al., 1993). there seems little doubt, however,
that ␣- xxxg3xxx /kat ii plays an important role in kynurenate formation from kynurenine in

the brain and other tissues. on the other hand, despite a
large number of publications in the last decade devoted at
least, in part, to kat i in brain, the evidence for a major
role of this enzyme in brain kynurenate formation has not
been conclusively established. consider the following: the
concentration of kynurenine in rat brain is about 5 pmol/mg
protein (ceresoli-borroni and schwarcz, 2000) or about
0.6 ␮m. the km for kynurenine exhibited by purified rat
gtk/kat i is more than three orders of magnitude greater
at 1.2–2.8 mm (okuno et al., 1990; alberati-giani et al.,
1995; kwok et al., 2002). typical km values reported for
glutamine as a substrate of gtk are ∼0.5–1 mm (cooper
and meister, 1974, 1981; van leuven, 1975, 1976; costa
et al., 1987), and the concentration of glutamine in rat brain
is about 5 mm (e.g., semon et al., 1988). other gtk amino
acid substrates, such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, cysteine,
methionine and histidine (noguchi et al., 1976; cooper and
meister, 1981), and the kat i inhibitor tryptophan (baran
et al., 1994) are present in rat brain at concentrations of
20–100 ␮m (semon et al., 1988). these concentrations in
rat brain are also much higher than that of kynurenine.
as noted below (section 7), the amino acid substrate cystathionine is present in human brain at concentrations of
∼1–3 mm. the km exhibited by gtk for this amino acid
is ∼2 mm (costa et al., 1987). these considerations imply
that there must be very little room for kynurenine to bind
to the active site of the pyridoxal 5 -phosphate (plp) form
of gtk in brain.
moreover, the relative activity of gtk-catalyzed transamination of kynurenine at ph 7.2 is only ∼10% that at ph 9.5

560

a.j.l. cooper / neurochemistry international 44 (2004) 557–577

(guidetti et al., 1997). finally, the ␣-keto acid concentrations in the brain are also not favorable toward kynurenine
transamination, as shown by the fact that kynurenate levels
can be increased in tissue slices by exposure to physiological levels of kynurenine, and high, non-physiological
levels of ␣-keto acids (hodgkins et al., 1999). the km
value exhibited by kat i toward pyruvate is quite low
at ph 9.5 (∼50 ␮m), but rises precipitously as the ph is
decreased to the more physiological range (guidetti et al.,
1997). the km values reported for pyruvate (okuno et al.,
1990; alberati-giani et al., 1995; kwok et al., 2002),
␣-ketoglutarate (alberati-giani et al., 1995),  xxxd2922xxx  (cooper and meister, 1974, 1981; van leuven, 1976),
and ␣kmb (van leuven, 1976; cooper and meister, 1981)
are ∼1.2–3.8 mm (ph 8.0), 0.09 m m (ph 8.0), ∼0.02 mm
(ph 9.0) and ∼0.08 mm (ph 9.0), respectively. the concentrations of these ␣-keto acids in the rodent brain are
0.07 mm (howse and duffy, 1975), 0.105 mm (howse
and duffy, 1975), ∼0.0010–0.0015 mm (sarkissian et al.,
2000), and <0.005 mm (cooper, unpublished), respectively.
these considerations suggest that pyruvate,  xxxd2922xxx ,
and ␣kmb occupy only a small fraction of the available
active sites of the pyridoxamine 5 -phosphate (pmp)-form
of the enzyme in the intact brain, whereas ␣-ketoglutarate
may occupy a relatively larger fraction. since, as noted
above, the turnover rate with ␣-ketoglutarate is very low
(alberati-giani et al., 1995), this ␣-keto acid may act not
so much as a substrate, but as a tight-binding competitive
inhibitor of kat i. the net result of low ␣-keto acid substrate concentrations (pyruvate,  xxxd2922xxx , ␣kmb)
relative to their respective km values and relatively high
concentration of the competitive inhibitor ␣-ketoglutarate in
brain will be a further slowing of any gtk/kat i-catalyzed
transamination of kynurenine in the brain.
in reports where the relative importance of kat i and
kat ii for kynurenate production in the brain have been
discussed, it is generally conceded that kat ii is the more
important of the two enzymes (e.g., schmidt et al., 1993;
guidetti et al., 1997; kiss et al., 2003; kocki et al., 2003).
in accord with this conclusion, baran et al. (1996), noted
that despite decreased kat i (but unaltered kat ii) levels,
a marked increase in kynurenate occurs in several brain regions in patients with down syndrome. the above discussion
shows that the weight of evidence is against kat i playing a
major role in brain kynurenate production. in order for kat
i (i.e., gtk) to play a substantial role in this process, kynurenine and gtk in the brain would have to be sequestered
from the major glutamine and other amino acid pools.

3. regulation of gtk enzyme levels
early work showed that gtk is a dimer containing tightly
bound pyridoxal 5 -phosphate cofactor (cooper and meister,
1974). later, stevens et al. (1986) showed that a cysteine
s-conjugate ␤-lyase of rat kidney is cytosolic gtk (see

below, section 9). perry et al. (1993) cloned and sequenced
a cysteine s-conjugate ␤-lyase from rat kidney. the cdna
coded for a protein (deduced subunit mr 48,000) containing
the deduced sequence ser–ala–gly–lys–ser–phe, which
corresponds to a plp binding site. shortly thereafter, mosca
et al. (1994) cloned and sequenced kat i from rat kidney.
it was recognized that the cysteine s-conjugate ␤-lyase of
rat kidney sequenced by perry et al. (1993) is identical to
gtk and kat i of rat kidney (mosca et al., 1994) and
brain (alberati-giani et al., 1995). the human enzyme
has also been cloned and sequenced (perry et al., 1995;
goldfarb et al., 1996). the deduced amino acid sequence
of the human enzyme exhibits an 82% overall similarity to
the deduced sequence of the rat enzyme with a 90% similarity around the plp binding site. the gene for the human
gtk/cysteine conjugate ␤-lyase (1) ( xxxg1294xxx ) is located on
chromosome 9 (perry et al., 1995).
in the rat brain, a large percentage of the cellular gtk
activity is in the particulate fraction/mitochondria (van
leuven, 1975; cooper and gross, 1977; cooper and meister,
1981), whereas in the kidney a much smaller fraction of the
total cellular activity is present in the mitochondria (cooper,
1988; cooper and meister, 1981). interestingly, the mitochondrial form of gtk/kat i is identical to the cytosolic
form except that the former contains an additional stretch
of 32 amino acids at the n-terminus (malherbe et al., 1995;
tamburin et al., 1999). apparently, the presence of cytosolic and mitochondrial forms is due to the presence of two
mrnas derived from the same gene encoding proteins, respectively, with and without mitochondria-targeting leader
sequences (malherbe et al., 1995; mosca et al., 2003).
mosca et al. (2003) cloned four cdnas from a rat kidney
cdna library containing several different 5 untranslated
regions (utrs). one of the transcripts, +14kat1 cdna,
contains an alternative translation initiation site. mosca et al.
(2003) showed that several kat i mrnas are expressed in
a ubiquitous manner, whereas +14kat1 mrna is present
only in kidney. the kat i mrnas exhibit different in vitro
translational efficiencies, which correlate with the levels of
enzyme activity in transfected cos-1 cells. the findings are
in accord with the predicted accessibility of the ribosomal
binding sites of the different mrnas (mosca et al., 2003).
abraham and cooper (1996) cloned and sequenced a rat
kidney gtk (subunit mr ∼ 48,500). the amino acid sequence of cytosolic gtk deduced by these authors is >90%
identical to that deduced by perry et al. (1993) and mosca
et al. (1994). the sequence from the middle to the c-terminus is identical in the two deduced sequences except for a
conservative threonine to serine change at the putative active
site. the two sequences from the middle to the n-terminus
are more dissimilar. the cdna obtained by abraham and
cooper (1996) contains identical sequences in the second
and third exons, and only partial similarity in the remaining
exons of the gene characterized by mosca et al. (1994, 2003).
it is most likely that the cdna obtained by abraham and
cooper (1996) is the product of a transcript from a distinct

a.j.l. cooper / neurochemistry international 44 (2004) 557–577

gtk/kat i gene in the rat (mosca et al., 2003). in this regard, it is interesting to note that there are at least two genes
on human chromosome 9 that encode for proteins with putative amino acid sequences similar to that already assigned
to human gtk (i.e.,  xxxg1294xxx ) gene (cooper, unpublished).
the reason for the complex regulation of gtk/kat i
protein levels in rat tissues via different mrnas with varying translational efficiencies, and possibly by two different
genes, remains to be elucidated.

4. gtk/kat i is mutated in spontaneously
hypertensive rats
kapoor et al. (1998) reported that kat i exists in two
forms (kat ia, kat ib) that can be detected in rat kidney homogenates by staining native gels for gtk activity
[i.e., transamination between l-phenylalanine and ␣kmb
(cf., abraham and cooper, 1991)]. in a later report from this
group, kwok et al. (2002) reported that spontaneously hypertensive rats contain a missense mutation (e61g) in the
kat i enzyme sequenced by others (i.e., perry et al., 1993;
mosca et al., 1994, 2003; alberati-giani et al., 1995), which
causes a shift of the kat i activity stained band on native
gels. the authors now suggest that the second “kat i” activity stained band in the control rat kidney is an artifact due
to the action of l-amino acid oxidase (kwok et al., 2002).
however, the authors have not ruled out the presence of a
separate gtk. the gtk cloned and sequenced by abraham
and cooper (1996) (mr 97,000) is very similar in size to that
cloned and sequenced by others (mr 96,000), and the two
proteins might be difficult to distinguish by activity staining
on a native gel.
kapoor et al. (1994, 1998) noted modest decreases in kat
activity in brain and kidney in spontaneously hypertensive
rats. the recombinant mutated kat i protein exhibited decreased km values for kynurenine and pyruvate compared to
the wild type, and 40–60% decreased activity (kwok et al.,
2002). kapoor et al. (1994) reported decreased levels of
kynurenate in rostral and caudal medulla as well as in spinal
cord in the spontaneously hypertensive rats. kwok et al.
(2002) suggested that the mutation in kat i may explain
the enhanced sensitivity to glutamate and nicotine in the
spontaneously hypertensive rats. alterations in kynurenine
metabolism may be related to the underlying mechanism
of hypertension and increased sensitivity to stroke (kwok
et al., 2002). however, gtk/kat i is intimately associated
with nitrogen metabolism. in this regard it is interesting that
amino acid profiles are greatly perturbed in spontaneously
hypertensive rats compared to controls (jones, 1988). in particular, glutamine levels are higher in plasma and gastrocnemius muscle in spontaneously hypertensive rats at 6 weeks
and thereafter. glutamine is elevated in the aorta at 6 weeks,
and lysine and arginine (a precursor of no) are greatly diminished in plasma and muscle of the spontaneously hypertensive rats (jones, 1988). anomalies in the levels of the

561

branched-chain amino acids in the hypertensive rats were
also noted (jones, 1988).
the spontaneously hypertensive rats also exhibit insulin
resistance (kwok et al., 2002). a direct relationship between insulin resistance and kynurenine metabolism is not
obvious. on the other hand, there is evidence for a role
of glutamine transamination in normal pancreatic function.
for example, pancreatic ␤ cells possess high gtk activity
(lenzen et al., 1985). moreover,  xxxd2922xxx  is a potent
insulin secretagogue. this property of  xxxd2922xxx  may
possibly be due to stimulation of ␣-ketoglutarate formation
via the  xxxg907xxx  ii pathway (i.e., gtk plus ␻-amidase)
(lenzen et al., 1985). thus, aberrant gkt may alter pancreatic function. acute administration of excess  xxxd2922xxx  to mice induces hypoglycemia, leading to convulsions
and eventual death (gazit et al., 2003). one of the functions
of gtk is to prevent excessive buildup of potentially neurotoxic  xxxd2922xxx  by transamination with glutamine
(see section 8). the possibility should be considered that
the symptoms in the spontaneously hypertensive rats, including essential hypertension and insulin resistance, may
be related at least in part to altered glutamine transamination and perhaps to altered sulfur and aromatic amino acid
metabolism.

5. gtk/kat i is widely distributed in brain
in the rat and human, gtk and ␻-amidase activities
are present throughout the brain (cooper and gross, 1977;
cooper et al., 1993). in the rat, the specific activities of both
enzymes are greater in the choroid plexus than in the whole
brain (cooper et al., 1993). this finding is interesting because in the kidney, gtk is found almost exclusively in the
proximal tubules (jones et al., 1988; macfarlane et al., 1989;
cooper et al., 1993). inasmuch as both the kidney proximal
tubules and choroid plexus are involved in transport phenomena, it is possible that gtk and ␻-amidase are somehow
involved in this process. it is also interesting to note that the
kidney proximal tubules and choroid plexus contain high
levels of the ecto enzyme ␥-glutamyl transpeptidase (e.g.,
tate et al., 1973) and that glutamine, methionine, and cystine
are good substrates of this enzyme (e.g., tate and meister,
1974; thomson and meister, 1975) and of gtk (see below,
section 7). the overlapping specificities suggest that both
enzymes may interact in transport phenomena involving
glutamine, methionine, and cystine. gtk and ␻-amidase
activities have also been detected in chick, mouse, and
rat astrocytes and neurons in culture (makar et al., 1994).
for each species, the specific activities were somewhat
higher in the astrocytes than in the neurons (makar et al.,
1994).
these above mentioned studies of neural gtk are mirrored, and in some cases extended, by workers who have
studied the same enzyme in brain, but under a different guise
(i.e., as a kat). for example, okuno et al. (1990) noted

562

a.j.l. cooper / neurochemistry international 44 (2004) 557–577

immunohistochemical staining for kynurenine-pyruvate
aminotransferase (i.e., kat i) throughout the rat brain in
astrocyte-like cells and, in some cases, in neurons. other
immunohistochemical studies suggested that kat i is more
prominent in astrocytes than in neurons (schwarcz et al.,
1992; du et al., 1992, 1993; roberts et al., 1992). in one
study, however, a predominant neuronal localization of kat
i immunoreactivity was noted in neurons in medulla and
spinal chord (kapoor et al., 1997). schwarcz and colleagues
carried out studies of kat i immunoreactivity in the rat
hippocampus (du et al., 1992) and rat striatum (roberts
et al., 1992). although there were regional differences, kat
i immunoreactivity was present throughout the hippocampus. in the striatum, it was noted that kat i reactivity was
abundant in the astrocytes in both the nuclei and cytosol.
reactivity was also present in the majority of medium and
large neurons. in these cells, the majority of label occurred
in round membrane-bound cytosolic organelles located adjacent to the golgi apparatus, rough endoplasmic reticulum,
and the cell or nuclear membrane. cisternae and vesicles
were identifiable in some of the labeled profiles. roberts
et al. (1992) suggested that the neurons may contain intracytoplasmic kat i storage sites.
several workers have investigated the distribution of kat
i mrna and activities in brain (plant et al., 1997; tamburin
et al., 1999; guillemin et al., 2001). for example, tamburin
et al. (1999) reported that kat i mrna is widely distributed in adult rat brain including hippocampus, piriform
cortex, and choroid plexus. the authors also reported that
the mitochondrial form of kat i mrna is expressed widely
throughout the rat brain (tamburin et al., 1999). the choroid
plexus had a high level of kat i message, but this mrna
appears to code for the cytosolic isoform, possibly suggesting a unique sectretory role for kat i protein (tamburin
et al., 1999). plant et al. (1997) also reported that the mrna
for gtk/kat i is widely distributed in rat brain, and that
the level in most regions rises to adult levels after birth, although in two regions the peak was reached before adulthood. interestingly, tamburin et al. (1999) noted stronger
expression of kat i mrna in neurons than in astrocytes,
so that relative message levels are not in accord with most
reports of relative levels of kat i protein in astrocytes and
neurons.
kat i enzyme activity in rat brain rises after birth, reaching a maximum specific activity in adult brain (ceresoliborroni and schwarcz, 2000). earlier, lockwood and duffy
(1977) reported that glutamine-glyoxylate transaminase activity (presumably gtk/kat i) is present in rat, rabbit, and
guinea pig brain. glutamine-glyoxylate transaminase activity is present in rat brain at birth, and the specific activity
rises after birth (lockwood and duffy, 1977).
in summary, gtk/kat i mrna and enzyme activities
are widespread throughout the brain and are present in both
astrocytes and neurons. kat i immunoreactivity is generally higher in astrocytes than in neurons, and gtk activity is
generally higher in cultured astrocytes than in cultured neu-

rons. however, the relationship between mrna and gtk
protein levels needs to be further explored (tamburin et al.,
1999). the finding that some immunoreactivity is associated
with vesicles in striatal neurons is intriguing. it remains to be
determined whether these are storage sites that could serve
as a physical basis for the possible segregation of gtk/kat
i from the major neuronal glutamine pools.

6. gtk and the methionine salvage pathway
gtk plays an important role in closure of the methionine salvage pathway. to appreciate this role, consider the
biochemical fate of the essential amino acid methionine.
the major route for metabolism of methionine in mammals involves its conversion to s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx 
( xxxd3156xxx ). in mammals, a portion of the  xxxd3156xxx  is
decarboxylated to decarboxylated  xxxd3156xxx  (dadomet; sadenosylthiopropylamine), which donates the aminopropyl
group to a suitable acceptor during polyamine biosynthesis
(giulidori et al., 1984). the simplest polyamine (putrescine)
is formed by decarboxylation of ornithine. the larger
polyamines (spermidine,  xxxd3234xxx ) are formed from putrescine by aminopropyl transfer(s) from dadomet (fig. 2).
polyamines are present in most organisms and are indispensable for normal cell function (e.g., tabor and tabor,
1976). 5 -deoxy-5 - xxxd2619xxx  (mta) is formed
from dadomet during polyamine biosynthesis (fig. 2).
from tracer studies, giulidori et al. (1984) estimated that
about one-third of  xxxd3156xxx  administered to rats is decarboxylated and participates in polyamine biosynthesis.
during polyamine synthesis, the metabolic fate of methionine carbon, sulfur and nitrogen are as follows: c1 →
co2 ; c2 –c4 and n → polyamines; s and ch3− → mta
(fig. 2). sulfur and methyl groups would be lost if there
was no way to convert mta back to methionine. because
reduced sulfur and methyl groups are often in short supply,
it is crucial that the methionine sulfur and methyl groups be
conserved. conservation is accomplished by the methionine
salvage pathway. by the 1980s, methylthioribose phosphate
(mtrp) and ␣kmb were known to be intermediates in the
salvage pathway and glutamine was known to be a major
source of the amine nitrogen of methionine (e.g., backlund
et al., 1982). a few years later, the complete pathway for
methionine salvage from mta in rat liver and in klebsiella pneumoniae was elucidated by abeles and colleagues
(furfine and abeles, 1988; myers and abeles, 1990; wray
and abeles, 1995; dai et al., 2001). in addition to bacteria (tower et al., 1993; wray and abeles, 1995; sekowska
and danchin, 2002) and mammals (backlund et al., 1982;
wray and abeles, 1995), the pathway is present in plants
(miyazaki and yang, 1987). the pathway for salvage of methionine from mta in mammals is shown in fig. 3.
several points concerning the methionine salvage pathway are of considerable biochemical interest. during one
complete turn of the pathway (figs. 2 and 3) the original

methyl group and sulfur of methionine are conserved. however, the c1 –c4 backbone of methionine is formed anew
from four of the five carbons of the ribose moiety of mta.
the ribose group is easily synthesized in vivo from readily
available glucose. the nitrogen of methionine is formed by
transamination of ␣kmb with glutamine in the last step of
the salvage pathway in mammals (fig. 3) and probably also
in bacteria and plants. in mammals, this step is catalyzed
by gtl in the liver and by gtk in liver and other organs.
this raises the question “why was glutamine chosen by nature as the amine donor rather than the more common amine
donor glutamate?” possibly, as a result of rapid removal of
␣kgm by cyclization and/or conversion to ␣-ketoglutarate,
transamination with glutamine will ensure lower levels of
␣kmb than is possible if glutamate were the amine donor
(cooper, 1988; cooper and meister, 1981). in this regard, it
is interesting to note that ␻-amidase activity is widespread in
nature and has been detected in mammals, plants, and bacteria (meister, 1953). the extensive occurrence of ␻-amidase
activity presumably co-evolved with the widespread occurrence of glutamine transamination.
an aci-reductone is an intermediate in the methionine
salvage pathway (fig. 3). such a compound had not been
identified previously as an intermediate in any biological
pathway. the enzyme catalyzing the oxidative scission of
the aci-reductone (aci-reductone oxidase, ard) has been
characterized in bacteria, but not in mammals. remarkably,

the bacterial enzyme is present in two forms, namely ard
and ard , each catalyzing a distinct reaction (dai et al.,
2001). ard contains ni2+ and converts the aci-reductone
to methylthiopropionate (mtp), carbon monoxide (co),
and formate. the reaction, therefore, bypasses the methionine salvage pathway. ard contains fe2+ and converts
the aci-reductone to ␣kmb and formate (dai et al., 2001),
a reaction on the main salvage pathway (fig. 3). the conversion of the aci-reductone to ␣kmb seems to require a
four-membered cyclic peroxide intermediate, whereas the
conversion of the aci-reductone to mtp seems to require
a five-membered cyclic peroxide intermediate (dai et al.,
2001). nothing is known about the mammalian enzyme. because co is a possible neurotransmitter/co-neurotransmitter
(e.g., baranano and snyder, 2001) it will be interesting to
determine whether the aci-reductone reductase in mammals,
in the presence of an appropriate metal cofactor, can act as
an alternative to heme oxygenase as a source of co.
the methionine salvage pathway requires seven enzymecatalyzed steps in mammals. the widespread occurrence
of this pathway in nature, despite the complex chemistry
involved, attests to its biological importance. in addition
to recouping methyl groups and sulfur, the pathway may
also prevent the build up of a potentially toxic metabolite
(i.e., mta). in the absence of the salvage pathway, mta is
extremely toxic to bacillus subtilis (sekowska and danchin,
2002).

fig. 3. the methionine salvage pathway from mta in mammals and the importance of gtk/gtl and ␻-amidase in closing the circle. the complete
methionine salvage pathway is a combination of figs. 2 and 3. notice that the methyl and sulfur originally present in mta, denoted by † and ∗,
respectively (fig. 2), are incorporated into  xxxd2595xxx . notice also that the nitrogen in the newly formed methionine is derived from transamination
of ␣kmb with glutamine in a reaction catalyzed by gtk/gtl. all steps appear to be enzyme-catalyzed in rat liver (wray and abeles, 1995). the
pathway is essentially the same in klebsiella pneumoniae except that mtrp is formed from mta in a two-step process involving methythioribose
(wray and abeles, 1995). key: ad, adenine;  xxxd2595xxx ,  xxxd2595xxx ; mta, 5 -deoxy-5 - xxxd2619xxx ; mtrp, methylthioribose phosphate; mtrp,
methylthioribulose phosphate; dkmp, 2,3-diketo-5-methylthio-1-phosphopentane; ␣kmb, ␣-keto-␥-methiolbutyrate.

sekowska and danchin (2002) showed that a protein
involved in mtr metabolism in non-photosynthetic b.
subtilis is a paralogue of rubisco (ribulose bisphosphate
carboxylase/oxygenase) — the enzyme responsible for
the photosynthetic fixation of co2 into organic carbon in
the calvin cycle. recently, ashida et al. (2003) showed
that the rubisco-like protein in b. subtilis catalyzes the
2,3-diketo-5-methylthio-1-phosphopentane enolase reaction
(dkmp → phosphoene-diol; fig. 3). interestingly, growth
in a mutant lacking the rubisco-like protein could be
restored by the gene for the functional rubisco from the
photosynthetic bacterium rhodospirillum rubrum (ashida
et al., 2003). the authors suggested that the rubisco-like
protein may be the ancestral protein of photosynthetic
rubisco. in that case, the methionine salvage pathway
predates the rise of photosynthetic organisms and must
have appeared early in evolution. it will be interesting to
determine whether dkmp enolase in mammals shows any
traces of this very ancient lineage.
the enzymes responsible for polyamine syntheses are
well represented in brain (e.g., bernstein and müller, 1999;
paschen, 1992). thus, brain produces mta from methion-

ine. the first enzyme in the pathway for conversion of mta
to methionine, namely  xxxg1471xxx , is also active
in brain (abbruzzese et al., 1983, 1986). it is not yet clear,
however, whether the brain contains a complete methionine
salvage pathway to convert the product of the  xxxg1471xxx  reaction (i.e., methylthioribose phosphate) to ␣kmb
or whether mtrp (or downstream metabolites) are exported
from the brain to be processed in organs such as the liver that
contain a complete salvage pathway. mta is an agonist (or
partial agonist) of the  xxxg81xxx  and an antagonist of the a2 receptor (munshi et al., 1988; lorenzen et al.,
1998, 2002; mendoza-fernandez et al., 2000). mta also inhibits binding of [3 h]flunitrazepam to rat brain membranes
(ki ∼ 16 ␮m) and may be a candidate for an endogenous
benzodiazepine-receptor ligand (tsvetnitsky et al., 1995).
moreover, mta is a potent product inhibitor of bovine brain
 xxxg2181xxx  (aminopropyl transferase) exhibiting a ki
of ∼0.3 ␮m (pajula and raina, 1979). as a result, mta levels are presumably tightly regulated. however, mta levels
in brain have not been systematically studied. determination of whether the brain contains a complete methionine
salvage pathway, whether mta occurs in the extracellular

a.j.l. cooper / neurochemistry international 44 (2004) 557–577

compartment, what factors control the level of mta, and
what role gtk plays in regulating the complete salvage
pathway (or segments thereof) should be fruitful areas for
future neurochemical research.
despite the central importance of ␣kmb in the methionine salvage pathway, there are potential biochemical
problems associated with this ␣-keto acid. ␣kmb formed
via the methionine salvage pathway or via non-specific
transamination of methionine with pyruvate/␣-ketoglutarate
(see section 8), is metabolized to mtp by chicken
liver l-␣-hydroxy acid oxidase (ferjancic-biagini et al.,
1995) (eq. (4)) and to mtp-coa by the mammalian
branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase complex (eq. (5))
(jones and yeaman, 1986). the mtp-coa is then hydrolyzed to mtp. mtp is converted in liver mostly to sulfate
and co2 (steele and benevenga, 1979), thus bypassing the
salvage pathway. metabolism of methionine to mtp followed by conversion to sulfate and co2 has been termed the
transaminative pathway for methionine catabolism (steele
and benevenga, 1979).

in the normal cell, mitochondria generate small but significant amounts of superoxide and its dismutation product
 xxxd2298xxx  (sohal and brunk, 1992).  xxxd2298xxx  can react with iron–sulfur centers in the mitochondria
to produce hydroxyl radicals (halliwell and gutteridge,
1989). the coincident location of hydroxyl radical formation and the branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase complex within mitochondria suggests that these organelles may
be a site for methional formation from ␣kmb and subsequent methional/mda formation. methional is a small-mr
apoptotic agent both for normal and  xxxg250xxx  − transformed cells
in culture (roch et al., 1996; quash et al., 2003). thus, an
important role of the glutamine transaminases is to prevent
the accumulation of ␣kmb and its subsequent metabolism
to potentially toxic methional.
in summary, an important role of gtk in mammalian tissues (and gtl in the liver) is to transaminate glutamine with
␣kmb arising either via the methionine salvage pathway or
via non-specific transamination reactions, thereby preventing the wasteful loss of methyl groups and sulfur. transamination of ␣kmb with glutamine will also prevent the build
up of the potentially toxic sulfur-containing metabolite methional in normal cells. it is possible, however, that specific
gtk inhibitors might be of use in promoting methional formation in vivo as a therapeutic (apoptotic) agent against
some cancer cells (roch et al., 1998; quash et al., 1995,
2003).

a product of mtp metabolism is potentially toxic methional.
this aldehyde is formed either via oxidation of mtp with
aldehyde reductase (eq. (6)) (quash et al., 1995, 1999, 2003;
roch et al., 1996) or via uncoupling of the e1 reaction of
the branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase complex from
the e2 and e3 reactions (eq. (7)) (roch et al., 1996). both
␣kmb and methional are effective oh• traps, giving rise
to ethylene (cohen and cederbaum, 1980; lawrence and
cohen, 1985). methional (but not ␣kmb), through interaction with oh• , can also give rise to toxic ch3 sh and
toxic malondialdehyde (mda) (lawrence and cohen, 1985)
(eq. (8)). mda is toxic in part because of its ability to
cross-link proteins, dna, and other macromolecules (e.g.,
halliwell and gutteridge, 1989).

7. unusual sulfur-containing products in brain
resulting from gtk-catalyzed transamination reactions
a number of sulfur-containing amino acids, in addition to methionine, are substrates of rat kidney, rat brain,
bovine brain, and bovine kidney gtks in vitro. these
include cysteine,  xxxd1273xxx , homocysteine, ethionine,  xxxd2596xxx , methionine sulfone, methionine
sulfoximine, cystine, cystathionine, lanthionine, thialysine
(s-(2-aminoethyl)cysteine), s-(3-aminopropyl)cysteine, s(2-aminoethyl)homocysteine (cooper and meister, 1974,
1981; van leuven, 1976; cooper and anders, 1990;
cavallini et al., 1983, 1991; ricci et al., 1986; costa et al.,
1986, 1987, 1989; coccia et al., 1992), and various homocysteine s-conjugates (lash et al., 1990). taurine and the
acidic sulfur containing amino acids ( xxxd519xxx ,
cysteic acid, homocysteic acid) are not appreciable substrates (cooper, unpublished). it is notable that vmax values
for cystine and cystathionine are comparable to those exhibited with glutamine and methionine (ricci et al., 1986;
costa et al., 1987). of interest is the finding that selenalysine is an excellent transaminase substrate of bovine brain
gtk (blarzino et al., 1989; coccia et al., 1992). remarkably, gtk can also catalyze competing transamination and
␤-elimination reactions with several cysteine s-conjugates,
several selenocysteine se-conjugates and at least one tellurocysteine te-conjugate (see sections 9 and 10). evidently,

566

a.j.l. cooper / neurochemistry international 44 (2004) 557–577

the active site of gtk must be relatively open-ended and
flexible.
some of the products formed from gtk-catalyzed reactions with sulfur-containing amino acids have been detected
in brain (see below). to understand the mechanism leading
to the occurrence of these compounds in brain consider
the transsulfuration pathway for methionine metabolism in
that organ. the first four enzyme activities of this pathway,
namely atp: xxxd2595xxx  s-adenosyl transferase, various
methyl transferases,  xxxg104xxx , and cystathionine ␤-synthase (fig. 4, steps 1, 2, 9
and 10, respectively), are present in brain at moderate to
high levels (e.g., mudd et al., 1965; eloranta, 1977). however, the activity of the next enzyme in the transsulfuration
pathway—␥-cystathionase (cystathionine ␥-lyase) — is low
in the brain (mudd et al., 1965). moreover, neurons in
culture cannot synthesize cysteine from methionine, suggesting a block in the transsulfuration pathway in these
cells (dringen and hamprecht, 1999).
owing to low ␥-cystathionase activity, the brain cannot
synthesize cysteine from methionine in amounts adequate
for endogenous glutathione synthesis and for other func-

tions. as a result, cyst(e)ine must be imported into the
cns (dringen, 2000, and references cited therein). cystine is taken up into the brain by the na+ -independent
xc − cystine-glutamate exchanger and by the xag − family of high-affinity, na+ -dependent glutamate transporters
(mcbean, 2002).
a consequence of low cerebral ␥-cystathionase activity, but high cystathionine ␤-synthase activity, and ready
uptake of cystine across the blood-brain barrier (bbb), is
the extraordinarily high concentration of cystathionine in
the central nervous systems of some mammalian species.
for example, tallan et al. (1958) reported a concentration
of cystathionine in autopsied adult human brain of ∼1 –
2.5 ␮mol/g wet weight. this value is 10 – 50 times higher
than that found in other human tissues (tallan et al., 1958).
a high concentration of cystathionine in autopsied human
brain was also reported by okumura et al. (1960). sturman
et al. (1976) reported a value of ∼0.7 ␮mol/g wet weight for
adult rhesus monkey brain. the concentration of cystathionine is lower in rat brain — about 0.08 ␮mol/g wet weight
(awata et al., 1995; kodama et al., 1983, 1985; yu et al.,
2000), possibly reflecting somewhat higher ␥-cystathionase

levels in rat brain compared to primate brain. the concentration of cystathionine is substantially increased in the brains
of rats administered the ␥-cystathionase inhibitor propargylglycine (kodama et al., 1985, 1988; yu et al., 2000).
the products of the gtk-catalyzed transamination of
cystathionine, cystine, lanthionine, and thialysine have been
investigated by cavallini and colleagues (cavallini et al.,
1983, 1991; ricci et al., 1986; costa et al., 1986,1987).
each of the ␣-keto acids generated by transamination cyclizes to a ketimine (fig. 5). the ␣-keto acid generated
by gtk-catalyzed transamination of selenalysine also cyclizes to a ketimine (blarzino et al., 1989; coccia et al.,
1992). cystine and lanthionine have two chemically identical amino acid groupings, whereas thialysine has only
one amino acid grouping. thus, transamination of cystine,
lanthionine and thialysine at either end should generate a
single product in both cases. on the other hand, cystathionine has two dissimilar amino acid groupings, so that the

567

formation of two dissimilar ␣-keto acids by transamination
is theoretically possible. however, evidence was presented
that only one amine group participates in gtk-catalyzed
transamination (ricci et al., 1986). the cyclized ketimine
derived from transamination of cystathionine has been given
the trivial name cystathionine ketimine (cysk) (systematic
name, 2,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1,4-thiazepin-3,5-dicarboxylate)
by cavallini et al. (1983, 1991). lanthionine, a lower homologue of cystathionine, occurs naturally in mammalian
tissues (cavallini et al., 1991) and is produced from two
equivalents of cysteine (or cysteine plus serine) by cystathionine ␤-synthase (braunstein and goryachenkova,
1984). the cyclic ketimines derived from cystathionine
and lanthionine have been detected in human brain at concentrations of ∼2 and ∼1 nmol/g wet weight, respectively
(fontana et al., 1997). cystathionine ketimine has also been
detected in bovine brain (ricci et al., 1990) and rat brain
(yu et al., 2000).

with the corresponding enamines (nardini et al., 1988a,b). [oxidation of lysine at the ␣-position is shown in the square brackets for comparison with
the sulfur-containing amino acids. there is no report that lysine is a substrate of gtk. ␣-keto- xxxd146xxx  may arise via the action of l-amino acid
oxidase or possibly via  xxxg102xxx  ii (ogawa et al., 1990).] cysk, lk, aeck, phtzdc, tmda, as well as a decarboxylated
dimer of aeck have been detected in brain (see text).

thialysine occurs naturally in mammalian tissues, probably originating via the action of cystathionine ␤-synthase
on  xxxd1787xxx  plus serine (pitari et al., 1992).  xxxd1787xxx 
is derived from the metabolism of pantetheine (pitari et al.,
1992). thialysine is a good substrate of gtk in vitro (ricci
et al., 1986; costa et al., 1987), and the cyclic ketimine
has been detected in bovine brain at a concentration of 2 –
3 nmol/g wet weight (nardini et al., 1990). interestingly, a
decarboxylated dimer, given the trivial name aminoethylcysteine ketimine decarboxylated dimer by cavallini and colleagues, has been detected in human urine, brain and plasma
(matarese et al., 1996, 1998, 1999; pecci et al., 2000). the
compound is a powerful antioxidant in vitro and may be
active in vivo (fontana et al., 1998; pecci et al., 2000). despite the high vmax value for cystine as a substrate of gtk
(ricci et al., 1986; costa et al., 1987; cooper and anders,
1990), cystine ketimine (ck) has not been detected in brain,
possibly because of technical difficulties or facile disulfide
interchange reactions. it is also probable that the redox state
of the brain ensures that most cyst(e)ine will actually be in
the form of cysteine (dringen, 2000).
a catabolic pathway for lysine degradation that is well
represented in brain involves conversion of that amino acid
to ␣-keto- xxxd146xxx  (murthy and janardanasarma,
1999), which cyclyzes to the ketimine 1 -piperideine
2-carboxylate. the ketimine is then reduced to pipecolate. cavallini and colleagues showed that an enzyme
purified from bovine brain that catalyzes the nad(p)hdependent reduction of 1 -piperideine 2-carboxylate to
pipecolate (possibly 1 -pyrroline 2-carboxylate/proline
dehydrogenase or a variant) also catalyzes the reduction
of cystathionine, lanthionine, and thialysine ketimines to
cyclothionine (perhydro-1,4-thiazepine-3,5-dicarboxylate,
phtzdc), 1,4-thiomorpholine 3,5-dicarboxylate (tmda),
and 1,4-thiomorpholine 3-carboxylate (tma), respectively
(cavallini et al., 1985a; nardini et al., 1988a,b), all of
which may be regarded as analogues of pipecolate (fig. 5).
cyclothionine has been detected in bovine brain (cavallini
et al., 1985b), rat brain (yu et al., 2000), and human urine
(matarese et al., 1987). tmda has been detected in bovine
brain (cavallini et al., 1985a) and human urine (matarese
et al., 1987). cystathionine ketimine and cyclothionine are
elevated in the brains of rats treated with propargylglycine
(yu et al., 2000).
the roles of the various cyclic ketimines and their
metabolites in the brain are not understood. possibly, they
represent dead-end metabolites of sulfur metabolism resulting from a bottleneck in the cerebral transsulfuration
pathway at ␥-cystathionase. however, some evidence suggests that the cyclic ketimines may have biological activity.
for example, [35 s]lanthionine ketimine (lk) binds strongly
to bovine brain membranes (fontana et al., 1990). there
appears to be one set of binding sites and the binding
is competitively inhibited by cystathionine ketimine and
thialysine ketimine (fontana et al., 1990, 1996). lanthionine ketimine partially displaces [3 h]adrenaline, but not

[3 h]dihydroalprenolol from bovine brain membranes, and
moderately stimulates adenylate cyclase in bovine brain
preparations (duprè et al., 1993). lanthionine ketimine
binds to bovine brain membranes at a concentration of
50 nm. the ketimine appears to bind to the membranes
>10 times more strongly than dopamine and dopa (duprè
et al., 1993). finally, lanthionine ketimine and thialysine
ketimine induce tyrosyl phosphorylation of 45-kda protein
in parallel with stimulation of superoxide generation in human polynuclear leukocytes (zhang et al., 1997). evidently,
more work is needed to establish the biological roles of the
sulfur-containing cyclic ketimines in brain.
8. regulation of ␣-keto acid levels by gtk under
normal and pathological conditions
gtk may be important in preventing the accumulation of
␣-keto acids arising through non-specific aminotransferase
reactions. many aminotransferases can catalyze a side reaction with amino acids that are not their primary substrates.
for example, mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase
can catalyze transamination reactions with phenylalanine,
tyrosine, histidine, methionine, and cysteine (miller and
litwack, 1971; shrawder and martinez-carrion, 1972). if
the ␣-keto acids resulting from these non-specific transamination reactions accumulate or are excreted, toxicity and/or
a drain in some cases of essential amino acid carbon may
ensue. we have suggested that gtk may act normally
to prevent this toxicity/drain (cooper, 1988; cooper and
meister, 1981). transamination reactions with glutamate/␣ketoglutarate are usually freely reversible. however, as
noted in section 1, transamination reactions with glutamine
are drawn in the direction of glutamine utilization. thus, the
␣-keto acid substrates of the glutamine transaminases are
maintained at low levels as a result of thermodynamically favorable conversion back to the parent amino acids at the expense of expendable glutamine. the ␣-keto acid analogues
of phenylalanine, tyrosine, histidine, methionine, and cysteine are all good substrates of gtk when glutamine is the
amine donor (cooper and meister, 1974, 1981; van leuven,
1976), and gtk may act normally to maintain low levels
of these ␣-keto acids in mammalian tissues.
the effectiveness of gtk in maintaining low levels of
certain ␣-keto acids may be appreciated by considering inborn errors of phenylalanine and methionine metabolism in
humans. phenylketonuria (pku) was the first inborn error
of amino acid metabolism recognized to be due to a defect in amino acid metabolism (følling, 1934). the disease
is caused by a block in  xxxg1660xxx  (e.g.,
scriver and waters, 1999) and is characterized biochemically by increased levels of phenylalanine, and secondary increases in  xxxd2922xxx ,  xxxd2610xxx , phenylacetate and
phenylacetylglutamine in body fluids (e.g., sarkissian et al.,
2000). the km value for phenylalanine exhibited by  xxxg2250xxx  is relatively high, so that under normal

a.j.l. cooper / neurochemistry international 44 (2004) 557–577

conditions this amino acid would not be an appreciable substrate of this enzyme (jacoby and la du, 1964). however,
because of the enormously increased levels of phenylalanine in pku it is expected that  xxxg2250xxx 
(and mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase) will generate
significant amounts of  xxxd2922xxx  in the patients. in a
mouse model of pku, plasma and brain phenylalanine levels
were 1.4–3.0 and ∼0.9 mm, respectively (sarkissian et al.,
2000). the phenylalanine levels in the plasma and brains of
the control mice were both ∼0.07 mm. remarkably, despite
the very large increases in plasma and brain phenylalanine,
the increase in brain  xxxd2922xxx  in the pku mice was
modest. levels of  xxxd2922xxx  in pku mouse brain versus control mouse brain reported by sarkissian et al. (2000)
were 1.2 and 2. 2 ␮m, respectively.
there has been a longstanding debate as to whether excess phenylalanine or a metabolite derived from this amino
acid, such as  xxxd2922xxx , is the more important contributor to the neuropathology of pku (see references cited
in sarkissian et al., 2000; feksa et al., 2003). the findings of sarkissian et al. (2000) suggest that although excess  xxxd2922xxx  may be neurotoxic under experimental
conditions, the enormously increased brain levels of phenylalanine may be the more important factor in the etiology
of pku. in this regard, it is interesting that gtk is apparently very effective at maintaining low levels of  xxxd2922xxx  in brain in vivo in pku, even in the face of increased
turnover of phenylalanine to  xxxd2922xxx  by non-specific
transamination reactions.
hypermethioninemia in humans may be caused by defects
in atp: xxxd2595xxx  s-adenosyltransferase i/iii (mudd
et al., 1995), or by defects in cystathionine ␤-synthase
(tangerman et al., 2000). despite high methionine levels in
these patients, the transaminative pathway for methionine
degradation is minor unless an extremely high threshold
of methionine (∼350 ␮m) is reached in the plasma (mudd
et al., 1995; tangerman et al., 2000). [the reference range
for methionine in normal human plasma is 13–45 ␮mol/l
(tangerman et al., 2000).] even at extremely high levels of methionine in the plasma (>350 ␮m), however, the
transaminative pathway for methionine metabolism is modest — probably accounting for about 20% of methionine
catabolism (tangerman et al., 2000). these findings are an
additional demonstration of the effectiveness of glutamine
transamination in maintaining low levels of certain ␣-keto
acids in the face of increased non-specific transamination.
continuous transamination of glutamine in vivo should
be accompanied by steady state levels of ␣kgm. indeed,
␣kgm has been detected in rat liver, kidney and brain, and
in human cerebrospinal fluid (csf) (duffy et al., 1974).
the concentration in rat brain is about 10 ␮m (duffy et al.,
1974). the concentration in human csf is about 4 ␮m, but
is greatly increased (∼15-fold on average, but up to 50-fold
in some cases) in patients in hepatic coma compared to
controls (vergara et al., 1974). ␣kgm can be detected in
csf by a unique spot test (cooper, 1978b). the intensity

569

of the spot is greatly increased in csf from liver disease
patients (cooper, 1978b). brain glutamine concentrations
are known to rise in liver disease (vergara et al., 1974).
however, because gtk is close to saturation with glutamine
in the normal brain, the enormous increase in ␣kgm in
the csf of patients in hepatic coma is not likely to be due
to increased glutamine. moreover, levels of brain glutamine
transaminase and ␻-amidase are not substantially altered
in portacaval-shunted rats, a model of human liver disease
(lockwood and duffy, 1977). possibly, the large increase
in csf ␣kgm in hepatic coma patients is due to disrupted
amino acid metabolism in the liver, resulting in increased
␣-keto acid substrates of gtk and/or to production of an
inhibitor of ␻-amidase. vergara et al. (1974) provided some
evidence that excess ␣kgm may be neurotoxic, but this
finding has not been followed up. the mechanisms by which
csf ␣kgm is elevated in liver disease require further study.
if the tight binding of ␣-ketoglutarate noted for gtk at
ph 8.0 with kynurenine as amino acid substrate (guidetti
et al., 1997) holds for transamination at ph 7.2–7.4 with
glutamine as amino acid substrate, then the gtk activity
in vivo might be normally under feedback inhibition by the
␣-ketoglutarate generated from the ␻-amidase reaction. evidently, much more work is required to understand the regulation of gtk and ␻-amidase activities in the normal and
diseased brain in vivo.
9. gtk catalyzes ␤-lyase reactions with some cysteine
s-conjugates — possible relevance to bioactivation of
neurotoxicants
many electrophilic xenobiotics and endobiotics are detoxified by the mercapturate pathway. this pathway is initiated
by conversion of the electrophile to a glutathione s-conjugate
followed by progressive conversions to the corresponding
cysteinylglycine s-conjugate, cysteine s-conjugate and finally the n-acetyl cysteine s-conjugate (mercapturate). the
mercapturate is generally more water-soluble than the parent electrophile and is readily excreted. for a review, see
stevens and jones (1989). on occasion, however, the mercapturate pathway may generate species more toxic than
the unmodified electrophile. an example where this occurs
is trichloroethylene, which is produced industrially in large
quantities as a degreasing agent and solvent. trichloroethylene is converted in part to the corresponding mercapturate
in vivo, a portion of which is excreted. however, the glutathione s-conjugate, cysteine s-conjugate and mercapturate
are all toxic. the glutathione s-conjugate and mercapturate
are readily converted to the cysteine s-conjugate, which is
the actual toxic species in vivo (dekant et al., 1994).
the bioactivation (toxification) results from the action of
cysteine s-conjugate ␤-lyases. if the cysteine s-conjugate
contains a good leaving group at the sulfur, then the mercapturate pathway may be bypassed by the action of the
cysteine s-conjugate ␤-lyases. these enzymes convert the

570

a.j.l. cooper / neurochemistry international 44 (2004) 557–577

cysteine s-conjugate [xsch2 ch(n+ h3 )co2 − ] to a sulfurcontaining fragment [xsh], pyruvate [ch3 (o)co2 − ] and
ammonium [nh4 + ] (eq. (9)).
xsch2 ch(n+ h3 )co2 − + h2 o
→ xsh + ch3 (o)co2 − + nh4 +

(9)

if the eliminated sulfur-containing fragment is reactive,
the parent cysteine s-conjugate may be toxic. two examples of toxic cysteine s-conjugates that have been extensively studied are s-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine (dcvc),
the cysteine s-conjugate of trichloroethylene alluded to
above, and s-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoethyl)-l-cysteine (tfec),
the cysteine s-conjugate of tetrafluoroethylene, which is
the industrial precursor of teflon. in the case of dcvc,
strong evidence suggests that the eliminated fragment (1,2dichloroethenethiol) gives rise to a chlorinated thioketene
(eq. (10)), which thioacylates macromolecules particularly
lysine residues in proteins (eq. (11)) (dekant et al., 1991,
1994; völkel and dekant, 1998). in the case of tfec, the
eliminated fragment (1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethanethiol) gives
rise to difluorothionoacetyl fluoride (eq. (12)) (dekant et al.,
1994), which also thioacylates lysine residues (eq. (13))
(for general reviews, see dekant et al., 1994; cooper, 1994,
1998; anders and dekant, 1998; cooper et al., 2002a).

much evidence shows that dcvc and tfec are mitochondrial toxicants (reviewed in cooper et al., 2002a). these
halogenated cysteine s-conjugates are notably toxic to the
kidneys, particularly the s3 region of the proximal tubules
(reviewed in dekant et al., 1994; cooper et al., 2002a). as
discussed in section 3, a cysteine s-conjugate ␤-lyase of
kidney cytosol has been identified as gtk (stevens et al.,
1986; perry et al., 1993, 1995; macfarlane et al., 1989;
goldfarb et al., 1996). it has generally been assumed that
gtk is a major culprit in bioactivating dcvc and tfec
in rat kidney (e.g., perry et al., 1993, 1995; macfarlane
et al., 1989; goldfarb et al., 1996). however, at least nine
mammalian plp-containing enzymes, including  xxxg1296xxx  (stevens, 1985),  xxxg102xxx 
ii, and several glutamate-utilizing aminotransferases have
also been shown to catalyze cysteine s-conjugate ␤-lyase
reactions (reviewed by cooper et al., 2002a). a particularly
prominent cysteine s-conjugate ␤-lyase in rat kidney mitochondria (tfec as substrate) is mitochondrial aspartate
aminotransferase (cooper et al., 2002a,b). studies with purified gtk showed that transamination competes with the

␤-lyase reaction at the active site, so that in the absence of
␣-keto acid substrate, the active plp form of the enzyme
is converted to the pyridoxamine 5 -phosphate (pmp) form
of the enzyme, which cannot support a ␤-lyase reaction
(stevens et al., 1986). in order for the ␤-lyase reaction
to proceed, an ␣-keto acid substrate must be included to
transaminate the pmp form of the enzyme back to the plp
form, which can then support a further ␤-lyase reaction
(stevens et al., 1986). transamination of dcvc appears to
effectively dampen the ␤-lyase reaction of gtk in intact
isolated kidney proximal tubules, because toxicity of the
conjugate is increased in this preparation by addition of
 xxxd2922xxx  or ␣kmb (elfarra et al., 1987). thus, the
␤-lyase activity of gtk in vivo is probably limited by the
low level of natural ␣-keto acid substrates. in conclusion, a)
gtk is one of several plp enzymes that can potentially contribute to the toxicity of halogenated cysteine s-conjugates,
and b) the ␤-lyase reaction in vivo may be dictated in
part by concentrations of the “natural” substrates in the
tissue.
inasmuch as many plp enzymes have now been shown
to catalyze cysteine s-conjugate ␤-lyase reactions, and several of these enzymes (e.g., gtk, mitochondrial aspartate
aminotransferase) are widely distributed in the body, most
tissue are theoretically at risk from toxic halogenated cysteine s-conjugates (cooper et al., 2002a). what then accounts for the heightened vulnerability of kidneys toward
halogenated cysteine s-conjugates in experimental animals?
the answer presumably lies in part with the high rate of
blood flow through the kidneys. in mammals, the kidneys
receive 20% of the cardiac output, yet these organs comprise
<1% of the body weight (pfaller and gstraunthaler, 1998).
blood flow through the human brain is also high. the human
brain comprises only ∼2% of the body mass yet receives
about 20% of the cardiac output (kety, 1985). moreover,
dcvc crosses the bbb (patel et al., 1993), is toxic to the
brain (reviewed in cooper et al., 1993, 1998, 2002a), and,
as noted above, gtk is particularly active in the mitochondrial fraction of whole brain and in the choroid plexus.
the findings that halogenated cysteine s-conjugates are
toxic in experimental animals is of public health concern
because trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene (which
also forms toxic cysteine s-conjugate) are major halogenated pollutants in the air, surface waters and ground
water in many areas of the us and other countries (e.g.,
roush, 1995). moreoever, the mercapturate pathway and
cysteine s-conjugate ␤-lyases (including gtk) are present
in human tissues (e.g., perry et al., 1995). although halogenated ethenes are metabolized more slowly in humans
than in rats (e.g., green et al., 2003), there is still concern.
wu and schaum (2000) estimate typical daily intake of
trichloroethylene in california residents of 11–33 ␮g per day
for inhalation and 2–20 ␮g per day for ingestion, with much
higher intake levels in a small segment of the population.
high-level exposure of workers to trichloroethylene is associated with increased risk of kidney cancer, liver cancer and

a.j.l. cooper / neurochemistry international 44 (2004) 557–577

other cancers (wartenberg et al., 2000). possibly, chronic
low-level exposure to environmental halogenated ethenes
(and other endogenously and exogenously derived electrophiles capable of forming toxic cysteine s-conjugates) in
a segment of the population may contribute to the mitochondrial dysfunctions known to occur in neurodegeneration of
aging. if that is the case then cysteine s-conjugate ␤-lyases,
including gtk, may be a contributing factor.
gtk also catalyzes transamination reactions with homocysteine s-conjugates yielding the ␥-mercaptobutyrate
s-conjugate (eq. (14)) (lash et al., 1990). in this case,
␤-elimination cannot occur. however, if there is a good leaving group in the ␥ position, non-enzymatic ␥-elimination of
a sulfur-containing fragment from the s-mercaptobutyrate
conjugate may occur (eq. (15)), resulting in the formation
of toxic 2-oxo-3-butenoate (vinylglyoxylate) (cooper et al.,
1989). thus, s-(1,2,-dichlorovinyl)-l-homocysteine is more
toxic (yields two toxic products by ␥-elimination following transamination) than is dcvc (yields one toxic product by ␤-elimination) (lash et al., 1990). homocysteine
s-conjugate formation in vivo might contribute to the toxicity of halogenated ethenes.

10. gtk is a possible target for conversion of some
prodrugs to active drugs in vivo
the ability of cysteine s-conjugate ␤-lyases to cleave a
c–s bond has been exploited in the design of cysteine sconjugate prodrugs of sulfur-containing anti-cancer agents.
elfarra and colleagues synthesized s-(purin-6-yl)-l-cysteine
and s-( xxxd2245xxx -6-yl)-l-cysteine as cysteine s-conjugate
prodrugs of the anticancer agents 6- xxxd2573xxx  and 6thioguanine, respectively (hwang and elfarra, 1989, 1991;
elfarra et al., 1995). in rats, these prodrugs target renal cysteine s-conjugate ␤-lyases, resulting in the selective release
of the thiol-containing drug in the kidneys (hwang and
elfarra, 1989, 1991; elfarra et al., 1995). given the relatively
open-ended active site of gtk and the ability of this enzyme to catalyze ␤-lyase reactions with dcvc and tfec,
it may be possible to devise cysteine s-conjugate prodrugs
that can be specifically tailored to this enzyme. taking the
concept a stage further it is theoretically possible that cysteine s-conjugate prodrugs of neuroactive compounds could
be devised to cross the bbb to be activated by gtk.
in addition to catalyzing ␤-lyase reactions with cysteine
s-conjugates, enzymes in rat kidney cytosol can catalyze a ␤lyase reaction with selenocysteine se-conjugates. the net reaction is the conversion of the selenocysteine se-conjugate to
a selenol, pyruvate, and ammonium (andreadou et al., 1996)
(eq. (16)). gtk is particularly effective at catalyzing ␤elimination reactions with the selenocysteine se-conjugates
(commandeur et al., 2000). transamination, however, competes with the ␤-lyase reaction, so that an ␣-keto acid substrate (e.g., ␣kmb) must be present to support the ␤-lyase

reaction. a recent study has shown that at least one tellurocysteine te-conjugate, namely te-phenyl-l-tellurocysteine,
is an excellent transaminase/␤-lyase substrate of rat kidney
gtk (rooseboom et al., 2002) (eq. (17)).

the ␤-lyase reactions with the selenium and telluriumcontaining conjugates are of considerable interest. seleniumcontaining compounds, including selenocysteine se-conjugates found in garlic, are anti-oxidants and effective
anti-cancer agents in a variety of organ systems, including
mammary gland, liver, colon, lung, prostate, and brain (see
references quoted in commandeur et al., 2000; rooseboom
et al., 2002). tellurium-containing compounds are often even more effective antioxidants than their selenium
counterparts (rooseboom et al., 2002). thus, selenocysteine se-conjugates and tellurocysteine te-conjugates may
be very effective prodrugs for the delivery of antioxidants/chemotherapeutic agents to the kidney (commandeur
et al., 2000; rooseboom et al., 2002). because the cysteine
s-conjugates dcvc is transported across the bbb, it is
likely that the selenium and tellurium conjugates will likewise cross the bbb. thus, given the high blood flow to the
brain and the presence of gtk in brain, the selenocysteine
se-conjugates and tellurocysteine te-conjugates might also
be effective prodrugs in that organ.
