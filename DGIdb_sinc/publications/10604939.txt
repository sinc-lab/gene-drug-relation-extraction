mcc-134, a novel vascular relaxing agent, is an  xxxd1422xxx  for the pancreatic-type atp-sensitive k(+) channel.  the effects of a novel vasorelaxant agent, mcc-134 (1-[4-(1h-imidazol-1-yl)benzoyl]-n-methyl-cyclobutanecarbothioamide++ +), were examined on reconstituted atp-sensitive k(+) (k(atp)) channels, which are composed of an inwardly rectifying k(+) channel,  xxxg1250xxx , and three types of sulfonylurea receptors (sur):  xxxg19xxx , sur2a, and sur2b. each type of k(atp) channel was heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney 293t cells. the expressed k(atp) channel currents were measured with the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp method. mcc-134 activated the sur2b/ xxxg1250xxx  channel, was a weak activator of the sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx  channel, but did not activate the  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  channel. mcc-134 suppressed  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  channel currents that had been fully activated by either  xxxd1868xxx  or nacn, whereas it did not affect the fully activated sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx  or sur2b/ xxxg1250xxx  channel currents. thus, mcc-134, which is a relatively effective opener of the vascular smooth muscle type (sur2b) of k(atp) channel, is an antagonist of the pancreatic type ( xxxg19xxx ) of k(atp) channel. therefore, depending on the subtype of sur, a pharmacological agent can cause either activation or inhibition of k(atp) channel activity.
