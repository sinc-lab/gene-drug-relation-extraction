summary-the
neurochemical and autonomic pharmacological profile of 1,2,3,4,10,14b-hexahydro-2methyl-pyra~no[2,l-a]pyr~do[2,3-c]~2] benzazepine (( +) xxxd2651xxx ) and the related antidepressant drug,
 xxxd2637xxx , have been compared. the uptake of 13h]noradrenaline (13hjna) in z&o was weakly affected
by (&) xxxd2651xxx  (pki = 5.6) in contrast to mian~rin t’pk; = 7.4). both (+) xxxd2651xxx  and  xxxd2637xxx 
facilitated the release of [3h]na in slices of cortex. the effects of na mediated by a~-adren~eptors on
the release of both [jh]na or [3h]serotonin ([3h]5-ht) were antagonized by (+) xxxd2651xxx  with pk; values
of 8.4 and 8.1, respectively. however, (-) xxxd2651xxx  only antagonized the effect of na on the release of
f3h].5-ht@a2 = 7.7). the binding of [“h]rauwolscine to a,-adrenoceptors was inhibited by (&) xxxd2651xxx 
and  xxxd2637xxx  with identical affinity (pk, = 7.0), whereas the binding of [3h] xxxd3000xxx  to a,-adrenoceptors
was less potently affected by (+) xxxd2651xxx  t’pk,= 6.4) than by  xxxd2637xxx  @ki = 7.1). a similar difference
was found for a,- and a,-adrenoceptors in vas deferens of the rat. the binding of [3h] xxxd2637xxx  to 5-ht,
receptors was less potently blocked by (&) xxxd2651xxx  (pk, = 8. i) than by  xxxd2637xxx  (pk, = 9.4) while the
binding of [‘hlmepyramine to histamine-l receptors was more potently affected by (f) xxxd2651xxx 
(pk, = 9.3) than by  xxxd2637xxx  (pk, = 8.75). the binding of [“h]quinuclidinylbenzilate to muscarinic
cholinergic receptors was blocked equally by (_+) xxxd2651xxx  (p& = 6.1) and  xxxd2637xxx  (py = 6.3). similar
data on tryptamine-d, histamine-l and muscarinic cholinergic receptors in isolated organs were obtained.
a prominent role for the blockade of k-adrenoceptors in the therapeutic effects of  xxxd2637xxx  and ( f )org
3770 in depression is suggested, probably excluding a role of inhibition of the uptake of na.

therapeutic

efficacy of tricyclic antidepressant

drugs

has been related to adaptive changes associated
with their ability to inhibit the uptake of monoamines
(schildkraut, 1965; halaris, belendiuk and freedman, 1975; sulser, vetulani and mobley, 1978). this
hypothesis has been challenged by the effectiveness of
second generation antidepressants, such as  xxxd2637xxx 
and iprindole, which lack substantial inhibitory properties on the uptake of monoamines in vitro and/or in
z&o (leonard, 1980). no correlation exists between
the potency of antidepressant drugs to inhibit the
uptake of monoamines and the therapeutic dose
(sugrue, 1983). in the treatment of depression, the
inhibition of the reuptake of noradrenaline,
oxaprotiline has been found to be superior to its
r-enantiomer, which lacks inhibitory properties on
uptake (schmauss, laakmann, dieterle, schmitz and
wittmann, 1985).  xxxd2637xxx  is a moderately potent
inhibitor of the uptake of noradrenaline in vitro, but
this property is far less prominent in viva (goodlet,
mireyless and sugrue, 1977; raiteri, angelini and
bertollini, 1976; baumann and maitre, 19’7’7).the
drug gives negative results in many behavioural tests

which predict antidepressant activity (van riezen,
pinder, nickolson, hobbelen, zayed and van der
veen, 1981). the properties of  xxxd2637xxx , both as a
moderate inhibitor of the uptake of noradrenaline
and a noradrenaline autoreceptor antagonist, may
combine to increase the availability of noradrenaline
in the biophase (baumann
and maitre, 1977;
nickolson and wieringa, 1981; raiteri, mama and
cerrito, 1982). therefore, a role of inhibition of the
reuptake of noradrenaline in the therapeutic effects of
 xxxd2637xxx  cannot be completely excluded. the
6-aza-analogue
of  xxxd2637xxx , 1,2,3,4,10,14b-hexahydro-2_methylpyrazino[2,1 -a] xxxd3047xxx [2,3-c][2]benzazepine ((f ) xxxd2651xxx ; see fig. 1) does not appreciably
affect the uptake of noradrenaline but, similar to
 xxxd2637xxx , increases the evoked release of radiolabelled noradrenaline (nickolson, wieringa and van
delft, 1982). electroencepholographic (eeg) studies
suggest antidepressant properties for (-&)grg 3770

methods

neurochemical studies
animals. male wistar rats (cpb: wv), weighing
between 15&200 g, were killed by decapitation and
the brains were rapidly removed.
uptake ofmonoamines. corpora striata and hypothalami were dissected, weighed and homogenized
in 20 volumes (w/v) of ice-cold sotution, using a
potter-elvehjem homogenizer (with a total clearance
of 0.25mm; 10 strokes up-and-down at 850rpm).
the solution contained 0.32 m sucrose, 0.01 m
glucose adjusted to ph 7.4 with 0.05 m tris-hcl. a
crude synaptosomal mitochondrial pellet (p2) was
obtained by centrifugation and was used for uptake
experiments.
further
details are described by
nickolson and wieringa (198 1). synaptosomes from
hypothalamus were used to measure uptake for
[3h]noradrenaline
([3h)na) while synaptosomes
from the striatum were employed for experiments
on the uptake of [3h]dopamine (f3h]da) and
[3h]serotonin ([3h]5-ht).
release of noradre~aline in slices. after decapitation of the rats, the brains were quickly removed
and slices of parietal cortex (about 0.3 mm thick)
were cut by hand with the use of a recessed perspex
guide. they were then chopped into 0.25 x 0.25 mm
squares with a mcillwain tissue chopper. following
preincubation for 10 min at 37°c in a krebs-ringer
buffer, the slices were loaded with [3h]na, final
concentration 2.5 x io-‘m, and about 5 mg tissue
was brought in each of 10 cells of a superfusion
apparatus and superfused with medium for 30 min, as
described by nickolson
and wieringa (1981).
depolarization-induced
stimulation of release due
to exposure to medium containing 12.5 or 26mm
potassium ions (k+) lasted 4 min and was given
twice (s, and s,), s, at t = 34-38 min and s, at
t = 5&54 min. drugs were added after the termination of the first k+ stimulus. fractional rates of
release of [3h]na were calculated and the percentages of evoked release of [3h]na were determined for
s, and s2. drugs were tested at 1 mm unless stated
otherwise. effects of drugs were evaluated by relating

ai,

the ratio sjs, for experimental cells (drugs present
during s,) to sjs, as found for the control cells. the
results represent the mean & se for at least 4 differential batches of slices of cortex. effects on evoked
release were rated by comparing the effect of the drug
(percentages increase of s,/s, , compared to control)
with that of the standard drug,  xxxd2637xxx  at 1 pm
which was measured concurrently.
release of noradrenaline and serotonin in synaptosomes. crude synaptosomal fractions (p?) were pre-

pared from the cerebral cortex of adult male
sprague-dawley rats, weighing 20&250 g. following
isolation, the synaptosomes were resuspended (at a
concentration of protein of 0.5-0.6 mg protein/ml) in
a krebs-ringer medium with the following composition (mm): nacl 125, kc1 3,  xxxg2125xxx , 1.2, mgso,
1.2, na,hpo, 5, glucose 10, tris hcl buffer 10, ph
7.4. after preincubation (10 min at 37°c in a rotary
waterbath) the synaptosomes were labelled (10 min)
either with 0.04 pm ( -)-[7,8[3h]]noradrenaline
or
with 0.04 /*m 5-[l,2-[3h]jhydroxytryptamine
creatinine sulphate. aliquots of the suspension were
then distributed
on 0.65 pm millipore
filters
(0.5-0.6 mg protein/filter) in a multi-chamber superfusion apparatus (raiteri, angelini and levi, 1974)
and su~rfusion was started with standard medium.
the superfusion medium in all the chambers contained 5 9 m desipramine (experiments on release of
[‘h]na) or 1 pm chlorimipramine (experiments on
release of [3h]5-ht) throughout the superfusion, as
inhibitors
of the carrier for noradrenaline
or
5_hydroxytryptamine, respectively. these drugs were
used in order to prevent the possible entry of noradrenaline into noradrenergic or serotonergic nerve
terminals and the consequent
displacement
of
[‘h]na or [3h]5-ht, respectively. desipramine and
chlorimipramine
by themselves did not alter the
release of the corresponding tritiated amines. after
10min of su~rfusion, noradrenaline was added to
the medium and, 8 min later, the synaptosomes were
depolarized with 15 mm kc1 (substituting an equimolar concentration of nacl). both (+) xxxd2651xxx 
and (-) xxxd2651xxx  were present from the beginning of
superfusion. fractions were collected every min into
vials containing 100 ~1 of a protective solution [1.5%
ethylene diamine tetra ammonium (edta) 1%  xxxd228xxx , 0.001% unlabelled na or 5-ht] and the
tritiated amines present in each fraction and in the
synaptosomes at the end of superfusion were determined as described previously (smith, lane, shea,
mcbride and aprison, 1975).
the tritiated amine present in each fraction of
superfusate was expressed as a percentage of the total
tritiated amine recovered (fractions collected plus
filter). student’s t-test was used for comparison of
mean values.
the pa2 values of the antagonists were calculated
according to the formula given by furchgott (1972):
pa, = log ([e’]/[e] - 1) - log[b]. [e’] and [e] are
the agonist concentrations causing half-maximum

binding studies

ross, tang and seeman (1980) was used to characterize serotonergic szreceptors. for routine experiments
the concentration of [3h] xxxd2637xxx  was 0.5 nm, concentration of tissue was 6.3 mg original tissue per ml
and incubation time was 40 min at 25°c. non-specific
binding was defined as the amount of binding of
[‘hlmianserin in the presence of 1 pm  xxxd2637xxx  and
was about 35-45% of total binding. binding to
histaminergic receptors was prevented by adding
50nm  xxxd3050xxx  to the incubation medium.
evaluation of binding data. displacement curves
were obtained for the various compounds
by
measuring binding in the presence of at least 5
different concentrations
and i&, and pki values
were determined. every observation was obtained
at least in triplicate. to enable these calculations,
k,, values were measured for the interaction between
the various ligands and the receptor. these were
for binding of: [3h]spiperone: kd = 0.22 nm; [3h]rauwolscine: kd = 3.1 nm; [3h]quinuclidinyl
benzilate: kd = 0.05 nm; [3h] xxxd3050xxx : kd = 5 nm;
[3h] xxxd2637xxx : kd = 1.85 nm; [3h] xxxd3000xxx : k,, =
0.13 nm.

binding of [‘hjspiperone in membranes from the
striatum. a rapid filtration assay was used to measure

the interaction between the antidepressants
and
dopamine d, receptors. the method used was
identical with the one described by seeman, lee,
chan-wong, fedesco and wong (1976) and titeler,
weinreich, sinclair and seeman (1978). for routine
measurements the concentration of [3h]spiperone was
0.2 nm, the concentration of tissue was 5 mg original
tissue per ml and the incubation time was 45 min
at 25°c. non-specific binding was defined as the
amount of binding of [3h]spiperone in the presence of
1 pm haloperidol and represented about 10% of
total binding.
binding of [3h]rauwolscine in membranes from
frontal cortex. the rapid filtration assay, described by

perry and u’prichard (1981), was used to characterize binding to a,-adrenoceptors. the assay with phosphate buffer and incubation at 0°c was employed.
for routine measurements the concentration
of
[3h]rauwolscine was 1 nm, concentration of tissue
was 10 mg original tissue per ml and the incubation
time was 90-120min.
non-specific binding was
defined as the amount of binding of [3h]rauwolscine
in the presence of 1opm  xxxd2914xxx  and was
about 20% of total binding.
binding of [ ‘h] xxxd3000xxx  in homogenates of frontal
cortex. the rapid filtration method of greengrass

and bremner (1979) was used to characterize
cr,-adrenoceptors. for routine measurements the concentration of [3h] xxxd3000xxx  was 0.2 nm, concentration
of tissue was 10 mg original tissue per ml and the
incubation time was 30min at 25°c. non-specific
binding was defined as the amount of binding of
[3h] xxxd3000xxx  in the presence of 2 pm  xxxd2914xxx 
and was about 10% of total binding.
binding of [ ‘h]quinuclidinyl benzilate in homogen ate.p of whole brain. the rapid filtration method,
described by yamamura and snyder (1978) was used
to characterize muscarinic cholinergic receptors. for
routine measurements the concentration
of [3h]quinuclidinyl benzilate was 0.6 nm, concentration of
tissue was 2.5 mg original tissue per ml and the
incubation time was 60min at 25°c. non-specific
binding was defined as the amount of binding of
[3h]quinuclidinyl benzilate in the presence of 1 pm
 xxxd247xxx  and was about 2% of total binding.
binding of [‘hjmepyramine in homogenates of whole
brain. the rapid filtration assay of chang, tran and

snyder (1978) was used to characterize the histamine1 receptor. for routine experiments the concentration
of [‘hlmepyramine was 2 nm, concentration of tissue
was 10 mg original tissue per ml and the incubation
time was 40min at 25°c. non-specific binding was
defined as the amount of binding of [3h] xxxd3050xxx 

and was about

isolated organs were used to measure the interaction between the various compounds and a,- and
a,-adrenoceptors (rat vas deferens), /$-adrenoceptors
(guinea pig right atrium), &adrenoceptors
(trachea
strip, guinea pig), histamine type 2 receptors (guinea
pig right atrium), tryptamine d-receptors (rat fundus
strip), histamine type 1 receptors (guinea pig ileum)
and muscarinic cholinergic receptors (rat jejunum or
guinea pig ileum). details of the automated assays
have been described extensively by de graaf, de vos
and steenbergen (1983).
the pre-junctional a,-adrenolytic activities were
determined on field stimulation in vas deferens preparations of the rat. male wistar rats weighing
200-300 g were used. an animal was killed by a blow
on the head and exsanguinated. the vasa deferentia
were removed and cut longitudinally over the full
length. each tissue was suspended in a lom1 waterjacketed organ bath, containing oxygenated (95%
0,; 5% coz) modified krebs buffer, kept at 37°c.
the baseline tension of the isometric transducer was
pre-set at 1omn (for full details see de graaf
et al., 1983). the organ was stimulated electrically
(supramaximally) by means of a constant current
stimulator equipped with two platinum ring electrodes (50-100 ma; 0.1 hz; pulse duration 1 msec).
concentration-response
curves were made with the
specific a,-adrenergic agonist azepexole (pd2 = 6-6.5)
(vargas and brugger, 1985).
the properties of histamine type 1 and the muscarinic cholinergic receptors were studied according

th. de boer et

402

to the classical method of van rossum (1963). the
agonists used were acetylcholine for the muscarinic
cholinergic receptor (pd, = 6-7) or histamine for the
histamine type 1 receptor (pd2 = 6-7). for details on
the bath liquids used see de graaf et al. (1983).
the equilibration period for the antagonists investigated was always 30 min.

all chemicals were of the highest quality available.
the following drugs were used:  xxxd2651xxx ,  xxxd2637xxx 
and their enantiomers (organon); desipramine, imipramine, chlorimipramine and  xxxd2914xxx  (ciba
geigy);  xxxd2746xxx  (hoechst); haloperidol (janssen

results

uptake of monoamines
the drug (+) xxxd2651xxx  was a very weak inhibitor
of the uptake of noradrenaline and had no activity on
the uptake of dopamine or serotonin. the results in
table 1 indicate that it was about loo-fold less active
than  xxxd2637xxx  on the in vitro uptake of noradrenaline.  xxxd2637xxx  had about the same selectivity
for the uptake of monoamines in vitro as desipramine
but was about io-fold less active.

in the binding test with [3h] xxxd2637xxx ,
respectively.
the difference between (-)org
3770
and (-) xxxd2637xxx 
was less pronounced.
(+) xxxd2637xxx  and (+)org
3770 were more active in the
binding test with [3h] xxxd2637xxx  than (-) xxxd2637xxx 
and (-)org
3770, respectively.
both (f)org
3770
and (+) xxxd2637xxx 
had negligible affinity for dopaminergic d, receptors, measured in the binding test with
[3h]spiperone. differing results were obtained with
respect to inhibition of the binding of [3h]quinuclidinylbenzilate
where (f ) xxxd2651xxx  and (f ) xxxd2637xxx 
showed a similar weak affinity, but activity was
concentrated
in (-)org
3770 and (-) xxxd2637xxx .
autonomic pharmacology
similar potency
ratios for (+)org
3770 and
 xxxd2637xxx 
were found for blockade of peripheral
histamine- 1 and muscarinic cholinergic receptors, as
compared to the receptors in tissue from brain (table
3). both compounds
also lacked &- and /?,-adrenolytic properties, but showed significant cc,-adrenolytic
properties in the vas deferens model in the rat. the
drug (+) xxxd2651xxx  appeared to be considerably
less
active in this model than (+) xxxd2637xxx .
these studies
were performed
both without and with an active
uptake system for noradrenaline
by measuring in the
presence and absence of cocaine in the medium.
addition
of cocaine to the medium increased the
apparent pa, value for the compounds
studied, but
a io-fold difference in cc,-adrenolytic activity between
(+)org
3770 and (f) xxxd2637xxx 
was maintained.
comparable data were obtained for (+) xxxd2651xxx  and
(+-) xxxd2637xxx .
comparison
of c(~- and cr,-adrenolytic
activity in the vas deferens model in the rat in the
presence of cocaine to prevent a role for uptake of
noradrenaline
revealed a modest 2-fold cr,-selectivity
for (k) xxxd2651xxx , while the potency ratio for tlz- and
a,-adrenoceptors
for (+) xxxd2637xxx 
was close to
unity, no significant influence of cocaine was found
on the pa, value for (+) xxxd2637xxx 
in the cc,-adrenergic vas deferens model in the rat (pa, with cocaine:
7.1; pa, without cocaine: 7.27). based on pa, values,
measured in the electrically-stimulated
vas deferens
for cc,-mediated inhibition
of the twitch response,
(k ) xxxd2637xxx  had a pa, value of 7.27 (table 3) and

was five-fold less active than yohimbine which had a
pa, value of 8.0 (data not shown). neither compound
showed intrinsic a-adrenergic
activity; (f ) xxxd2651xxx 
was five-fold less active than (f) xxxd2637xxx ,
with
respect to the tryptamine-d
receptor in the fundus
strip in the rat.
reiease of noradrenaline in slices of cortex
both (+) xxxd2637xxx 
and (+)org
3770 facilitated
the release of [3h]na from slices of cortex evoked
with 12.5 or 26 mm k+ (table 4). the facilitation
was larger with the smaller k+ stimulation,
where
both ( f ) xxxd2637xxx  and ( f ) xxxd2651xxx  at 1 pm concentration
increased
the release of [3h]na to
the same extent. using 26 mm k+ as a stimulus,
(+) xxxd2637xxx 
was more effective than (f)org
3770
and its enantiomers in increasing the evoked release.
similar data were obtained when the concentration
dependency
of the facilitation of release of [3h]na
was studied (fig. 2). again, (f)org
3770 was considerably
less active than ( f ) xxxd2637xxx , whereas
(+) xxxd2651xxx  appeared to be almost equipotent with
(f) xxxd2637xxx .
 xxxd2914xxx 
(10 pm) increased the
release with 58 + 10.7% (8) and thus was less active
than (k) xxxd2637xxx ,
but it increased the release to the
same extent as 10pm (f)org
3770; (-)org
3770
only slightly increased the release of [3h]na.

discussion

the antidepressant drug ( f ) xxxd2637xxx  increases
the availability of noradrenaline through blockade of
presynaptic a,-adrenoceptors (baumann and maitre,
1977; nickolson and wieringa, 1981; raiteri et al.,
1982). its considerable potency as an inhibitor of the
uptake of noradrenaline in vitro may contribute to
the increase of availability of noradrenaline in the
synaptic cleft. therefore, it is still unclear whether
blockade of norad~naiine
autoreceptors as such
is su~cient for therapeutic etlicacy in depression.
besides, chronic treatment with  xxxd2637xxx  sensitizes
serotonergic transmission through a yet unknown
mechanism which is presumably related to the potent
s-ht, antagonistic properties of (&) xxxd2637xxx  (blier,
de montigny and tardif, 1984).
the drug (+) xxxd2651xxx  is chemically closely related
to, but has a neurochemical profile differing from
(2) xxxd2637xxx 
in two ways. (f) xxxd2651xxx  did not
inhibit noradrenaline uptake in vitro and it was found
to be 20-fold weaker than (&) xxxd2637xxx  as a 5ht,antagonist. the a,-adrenolytic properties have been
studied in various models. first, (+)qrg 3770 was
equipotent with  xxxd2637xxx  as an antagonist of
aradrenoceptors
in most of the models studied,
although (+ ) xxxd2651xxx  was three-fold less active as an

antagonist of inhibition of the twitch response in the
electrically-stimulated
vas deferens preparation induced by azepexole. in addition, using membranes
from the cortex of the rat, (+) xxxd2651xxx  was found
to have five-fold preference for cr,-, over cr,-adrenoceptors, while  xxxd2637xxx  did not discriminate between
these subtypes of adrenoceptors. both (+) xxxd2637xxx 
and (l)org
3770 were moderately potent in displacing radiolabelled rauwolscine from its binding
sites with ki values of about io-‘m. similar data
have been found for ( i: ) xxxd2637xxx  in various binding
tests using different a,-adrenergic ligands (pinder,
1985). these binding data refer almost exclusively to
postsynaptic cc,-adrenoceptors (dausse, le quau-bui
and meyer, 1982).
experiments with (+) xxxd2651xxx  and (f ) xxxd2637xxx 
in slices of cortex clearly revealed the a,-blocking
effects of these compounds and confirmed that the
a,-adrenoceptor
antagonist
property resided in
(+) xxxd2651xxx . measurement of exact pa, values in
such models is not possible due to the tonic inhibition
of release of 13h]na by endogenous noradrenaline.
the data on antagonism of the noradrenahneinduced inhibition of release of [3h]na in synaptosomes showed a concentration-dependent
shift to the
right of the inhibition curve for (+) xxxd2651xxx . from
these data, pa, values of about 8 could be calculated,
suggesting that (+) xxxd2651xxx  had a six-fold preference for noradrenaline autoreceptors, compared to
postsynaptic a,-adrenoceptors.
studies in the vas
deferens preparation
showed that presynaptic
~~-adrenocepto~ and postsynaptic a,-adreno~ptors
(in the presence of cocaine to exclude a role of
inhibition of uptake) were blocked by (~}mian~~n
and its enantiomers with equal potency. in these

406

th. de boer et af.

studies, (~} xxxd2637xxx  was five-fold less active than
the classical a,-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine.
comparing the affinities of (+) xxxd2651xxx  and
(+_) xxxd2637xxx  in central (cortical synaptosomes) and
peripheral (vas deferens preparation) models for
a,-adrenolytic activity revealed at least a lo-fold
difference in potency. this difference suggests that
these compounds have a preferential effect on central,
compared to peripheral, presynaptic adrenoceptors.
different subclasses of a,-adrenoceptors have been
described in the literature. using [‘hlclonidine as
a ligand, both high and low affinity states of the
a~-binding site were detected. (~)mian~~n
was
found to be strongly active in blocking the high and
low affinity site of the binding of [3h]clonidine
(maggi, uprichard
and enna, 1980). both enantiomers of  xxxd2637xxx  showed identical affinity
for these binding sites for [3h]clonidine (johnson,
nelson, nicholass, richards and thomas, 1984),
which contrasted with the greater activity of
(+) xxxd2637xxx 
in modulating the release of noradrenaline from tissue slices and synaptosomes. also,
in the binding studies with [3h]rauwolscine a six-fold
preference for (+) over (-) xxxd2637xxx 
was observed. the differences were even more pronounced
for  xxxd2651xxx , showing a 40-fold preference for (+)
compared to (-) xxxd2651xxx  in the binding of t3h]rauwolscine. based on comparison of rank orders of
adrenergic drugs modulating release of noradrenaline
and serotonin through presynaptic adrenoceptors, it
has been proposed that these two types of ar-adrenoceptors differ pharmacologically (frankhuysen and
mulder, 1982). such a difference was clearly shown
by using the enantiomers
of  xxxd2637xxx :
the
(-)enantiomer
blocked the az-postsynaptic receptors
sited on serotonergic nerve terminals but not the
or?-autoreceptors, whereas (+) xxxd2637xxx  was effective
at both auto- and postsynaptic receptors (raiteri,
maura and versace, 1983). the enantiomers of org
3770 behaved similarly, the (+)enantiomer
being
moderately more effective than the (-)enantiomer.
several studies had previously shown the moderate
a,-antagonistic properties of  xxxd2637xxx , compared to
other potent and selective adrenolytics. without exception, such potency ratios have been based
on antagonism of the interaction of clonidine or
other potent a-adrenergic drugs with behavioural
or physiological parameters (dettmar, lynn and
tulloch, 1983; doxey, roach and smith, 1983; drew,
gower and marriot, 1979).  xxxd2637xxx  behaved as a
moderately active ~*-antagonist in these tests, in
agreement with the binding data. however, both
 xxxd2637xxx  and  xxxd2651xxx  behaved like very potent
presynaptic antagonists in vas deferens of the rat
or in cortical synaptosomes suggesting that these
compounds may preferentially block a,-adrenergic
autoreceptors.
the results of a short-term, double-blind, placebocontrolled clinical trial with (&) xxxd2651xxx  suggested
that the compound is an effective antidepressant with

a potency at least similar to that of (~)mian~~n
(claghorn, johnstone, studebaker and ajeman,
1987). a role for inhibition of the uptake of noradrenaline in the therapeutic effects of (&) xxxd2637xxx 
has been considered to be unlikely in view of the weak
effects of (+) xxxd2637xxx 
in models presumed to
measure uptake in uivo (goodlet et al., 1977; van
riezen et al., 1981). the clinical efficacy of (+)org
3770 would support that view since (+) xxxd2651xxx  did
not inhibit the uptake of noradrenaline
in uitro.
therefore, it is tempting to suggest that the a,-antagonistic properties of (+) xxxd2637xxx  and ( f ) xxxd2651xxx 
represent the principal factor involved in the therapeutic effects of these drugs in depressed patients (see
also pinder, 1985). theoretically, an increase of noradrenaline in the biophase invoives mutually antagonistic effects as it may inhibit the release and
synthesis of noradrenaline
through autoreceptors
while, on the other hand, postsynaptic effects will be
facilitated. at the postsynaptic level, the responses of
noradrenaline
in slices of cortex are mediated
through a &receptor
coupled adenylate cyclase
which is additionally stimulated through a postsynaptic a,-adrenoceptor (duman, strada and enna,
1985; pile and enna, 1986). an inhibitory control by
~~-adren~eptors
in membrane preparations from
cortex has been demonstrated on the formation of
the  xxxd1773xxx  activated by  xxxd1742xxx  (kitamura,
nomura and segawa, 1985). in slices, (&) xxxd2637xxx 
inhibits the a*-adrenoceptor-mediated component of
the stimulatory effect of adrenergic drugs on the
formation of  xxxd1773xxx  (pile and enna, 1986).
however, (+) xxxd2637xxx  is about 6-fold more potent
than (-) xxxd2637xxx .
taken together, blockade by
(+) xxxd2637xxx  and probably also by (+) xxxd2651xxx , of
the presynaptic inhibitory autoreceptor and the postsynaptic stimulatory or,-adrenoceptor may facilitate
~,-re~ptor-mediated
noradrenergic transmission.
long term blockade of ~rotonin receptors results
in supersensitivity of the serotonin system (blier et
al., 1984). such a mechanism offers an alternative
explanation for the therapeutic effects of (ifr) xxxd2637xxx . however, (+) xxxd2651xxx  was considerably less
active as a serotonin antagonist in the binding test
with 13h] xxxd2637xxx  or the fundus strip model in the
rat. since (&) xxxd2651xxx  was considerably weaker as
a sht,-antagonist but apparently equipotent in the
clinic with (f) xxxd2637xxx ,
it appears unlikely that
antagonistic properties to serotonin explain the antidepressant effects of (+) xxxd2651xxx . however, a role of
5-ht antagonism in the therapeutic effects of  xxxd2637xxx  cannot be excluded in view of the potent
sht,-antagonistic properties of  xxxd2637xxx .
both (+) xxxd2651xxx  and (_+) xxxd2637xxx  had moderate affinity for muscarinic cholinergic receptors,
while both compounds where potent histamine-l
antagonists. however, a role for the blockade of these
receptors in the therapeutic effects of antidepressant
drugs is highly unlikely (hall and ogren, 1981).
in conclusion, a careful comparison of the neuro-

profiles of the 6-aza-analogue of mian serin,  xxxd2651xxx  and its enantiomers

chemical and autonomic pha~acological
properties
of (f) xxxd2637xxx 
and the chemically related drug
(&) xxxd2651xxx  suggests a prominent role for blockade
of a2-adrenoceptors in the therapeutic effects of  xxxd2637xxx  and (+) xxxd2651xxx  in depression, probably
excluding a role for inhibition of the uptake of
noradrenaline.
