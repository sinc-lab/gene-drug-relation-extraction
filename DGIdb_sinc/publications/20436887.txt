tissue inflammation is a major component of the acne
process. leukotriene b4 (ltb4) is considered to be a major
player in the development of tissue inflammation. synthesis of
ltb4 is controlled by the enzyme  xxxg147xxx . since  xxxd3554xxx 
blocks the activity of  xxxg147xxx , experimental and clinical
studies have been conducted to test mode of function, as well
as efficacy and safety of this compound in the treatment of acne
vulgaris. human sz95 sebocytes and inflammatory cells in vitro
express the enzymes of the leukotriene pathway at mrna and
protein levels and enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of ltb4
are activated in sebaceous glands of acne lesions. pre-treatment
of sz95 sebocytes with  xxxd3554xxx  partially prevented short-term
 xxxd208xxx -induced effects, such as induction of ltb4,
increase of neutral lipid content and stimulation of interlekin-6
release. long-term treatment with  xxxd3554xxx  directly reduced the
content of neutral lipids and interleukin-6 release from sz95
sebocytes. ppar mrna levels were not regulated by  xxxd3554xxx .
in a first pilot clinical study with 10 patients with papulopustular acne  xxxd3554xxx  4 x 600 mg/d p.o. for 3 months decreased
the acne severity index in a time-dependent manner being 41%
of the initial score at week 12 (p < 0.05). this was mostly due
to a decrease of the number of inflammatory lesions of 29%
(p < 0.01). in addition, total sebum lipids significantly decreased
(35%, p < 0.05) and the pro-inflammatory free  xxxd2154xxx  (22%)
and lipoperoxides (26%) were markedly diminished in patients’
sebum under treatment. the magnitude of clinical improvement strongly correlated with the reduction of total sebum lipids
(p = 0.0009, r2 = 0.81) and free  xxxd2154xxx  (p = 0.0003, r2 =
0.82). in a further study, a 40-year-old female with mild disseminated sebaceous gland hyperplasia and seborrhea, responded
with normalization of the casual skin surface lipids and similar
reduction of facial sebum synthesis under treatment with
 xxxd3554xxx  over 2 weeks and—after a wash-out phase—low-dose

isotretinoin (10 mg/2nd d) over 5 weeks. these data are in agreement with a phase ii multicenter, clinical study in 101 patients
with mild to moderate inflammatory facial acne conducted in the
us, which showed a significant efficacy of  xxxd3554xxx  in a subset of
patients with moderate acne, whereas those patients treated with
 xxxd3554xxx  showed a significant mean decrease in inflammatory
lesions compared to the placebo group. in all clinical studies,
 xxxd3554xxx  was found to be safe and well tolerated.

introduction
tissue inflammation is a major component in the process of
the development of acne lesions.1-4 patients with severe acne have
been shown to benefit by a treatment with anti-inflammatory
agents.5-9 on the other hand, enzymes involved in the biosynthesis
of the proinflammatory lipids leukotriene (lt)-b4 and prostaglandin-e2 are activated in sebaceous glands of acne lesions.10
ltb4 is a  xxxg147xxx  (lox)/ xxxg1346xxx  hydrolase product of
 xxxd208xxx  (aa) metabolism.11,12 aa induces ltb4 and
interleukin (il)-6 release and enhances lipid synthesis in cultured
human sebocytes.5,13 interestingly, ltb4 is also a natural ligand for
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar)-alpha.14,15 ppars,
ligand-activated transcription factors belonging to the nuclear
receptor superfamily, are activated by fatty-acid derivatives and
can regulate lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, cell proliferation,
differentiation and apoptosis of various cell types,16,17 including
sebaceous gland cells.10,18 especially,  xxxg1805xxx  can modulate the
inflammatory response in various cell types by inhibiting the
expression of proinflammatory genes such as cytokines, metalloproteinases and acute-phase proteins.15,19
since  xxxg147xxx  catalyzes ltb4 production, inhibition of  xxxg147xxx 
provides an attractive target for downregulation of inflammatory
processes in the sebaceous gland.20  xxxd3554xxx  [(±)-1-(1-benzo[b]
thien-2-ylethyl)- xxxd2304xxx ], is an orally active and selective
 xxxg147xxx  inhibitor been approved in the us for the treatment of
asthma (zyflotm).21 we have conducted experimental22 and
clinical studies23,24 to test mode of function, as well as efficacy and
safety of this compound in the treatment of acne vulgaris.

+  xxxd3554xxx  (5 x 10-5 m). untreated cultures served as controls. (b) sz95

was not cytotoxic at 24 h. long-term treatment with aa (14 d)
increased intracellular neutral (sebaceous) lipids in sz95 sebocytes
(19 ± 2%; p < 0.001), as previously described.13 interruption of
aa treatment (switch from 13 d aa treatment to 24 h no treatment) led to reduction of neutral lipids (minus 30 ± 1%; p < 0.001;
fig. 1a). long-term treatment with  xxxd3554xxx  reduced neutral
lipids in sz95 sebocytes (minus 17 ± 2%; p < 0.001). in addition,
pre-treatment with  xxxd3554xxx  prevented the aa-induced increase
of neutral lipids in sz95 sebocytes (minus 35 ± 3%; p < 0.001).
aa did not affect polar (cell membrane) lipids of sz95 sebocytes. long-term and short-term (24 h) treatment with  xxxd3554xxx 
slightly reduced polar lipids (comparison of aa +  xxxd3554xxx  treatment with switch of  xxxd3554xxx  treatment to  xxxd3554xxx  + aa; minus
43 ± 2%; p < 0.001).
the long-term aa +  xxxd3554xxx  treatment increased polar
lipids (19 ± 2%; p < 0.01), which are cell membrane lilpids and,
therefore, indicate an increase of sebocyte number. the latter
was confirmed by the cell number-associated fda afu increase
(8 ± 2%; p < 0.01) (fig. 1a). the concomitant increase of neutral
lipids (36 ± 4%; p < 0.01) under this treatment is, thereafter,
probably due to the increased cell number detected.
aa induced a marked ltb4 generation in sz95 sebocytes
both after long-term (14 d; 656 ± 35%; p < 0.001) and short-term
(24 h; control→aa; 800 ± 120%; p < 0.001) treatment (fig. 1b).
discontituation of aa treatment quickly attenuated ltb4
production (minus 94 ± 4%; p < 0.001). while long-term
maintenance of sz95 sebocytes in aa +  xxxd3554xxx  did not influence the marked ltb4 production as compared with aa alone,
pre-treatment with  xxxd3554xxx  reduced the short-term aa-induced
ltb4 generation (minus 34 ± 22%; p < 0.05).
short-term but not long-term treatment with aa resulted
in increased release of il-6 by sz95 sebocytes (41 ± 1%;
p < 0.001), whereas interruption of aa treatment reduced
quickly il-6 cell release (24 h; switch of aa treatment to no
treatment; minus 35 ± 2%; p < 0.001; fig. 1c). long-term
treatment with  xxxd3554xxx  reduced il-6 release from sz95
sebocytes (minus 42 ± 1%; p < 0.001).
in contrast, aa,  xxxd3554xxx  and their combination did not
affect il-8 release by sz95 sebocytes.
 xxxd3554xxx  did not affect the  xxxg1805xxx ,  xxxg1806xxx , ppargamma1 and
ppargamma2 mrna levels of sz95 sebocytes treated with aas.

clinical studies
a gradual and time-related reduction in inflammatory
lesions and acne severity was shown under the treatment with

patients, materials and methods
experimental study.22 immortalized human facial sz95
sebocytes, been shown to conserve the major characteristics of
normal sebocytes25 were cultured in sebomed® medium with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 5 ng/ml human recombinant
 xxxg681xxx , 1 mm cacl2 and 50 mug/ml gentamicin
at 37°c in a 5% co2 atmosphere. after leaving the cells to attach
for 24 h, the culture medium (and compounds to be tested) was
replaced thrice, namely every 2nd day. cells were subcultured once
weekly.
a first panel of sz95 sebocytes were treated for 14 d with
aa (10-5 m),  xxxd3554xxx  (5 x 10-5 m) or aa (10-5 m) +  xxxd3554xxx 
(5 x 10-5 m) dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso) with a final
dmso concentration of 0.2% in medium. untreated cultures
in medium supplemented with 0.2% dmso served as controls.
a second panel of identical sz95 sebocyte cultures were washed
twice with phosphate-buffered saline without ca2+ and mg2+
(pbs) after 13 d and were subsequently further treated with or
without aa and/or  xxxd3554xxx  for 24 h.
for detection of cytotoxicity, sz95 sebocytes were cultured
for 24 h, washed with pbs and treated with aa (10-9 to 10-4 m)
or  xxxd3554xxx  (10-7 to 5 x 10-5 m). lactate dehydrogenase (ldh)
release was measured in supernatants at 4 and 24 h with a ldh
assay kit.13
for cell quantification, sz95 sebocytes were treated with
the compounds mentioned above for 24 h and assessed by the
fluorescein diacetate assay (fda).25
the detection of intracellular lipids was performed in parallel
wells with sz95 sebocytes incubated with 100 mul of a 1 mug/ml nile
red solution at 37°c for 20 min.25
for ltb4 detection, sz95 sebocytes were treated with the
compounds mentioned above for 24 h. the culture supernatants
were assayed for ltb4 by a colorimetric enzyme immunoassay.22
il (interleukin)-6 and il-8 levels were determined in the same
supernatants using elisa kits.
ppar mrna levels were assessed by quantitative rt-pcr.
sz95 sebocytes were treated with the compounds mentioned
above for 24 h. mrna was extracted and reverse transcribed to
cdna. the following primers and probes were used:  xxxg1805xxx  sense

clinical studies.23,24 an open-label drug, ethic committeeapproved, industry-independent study in a small cohort of 10
consecutive patients (4 female, 6 male; median age 17 years)
www.landesbioscience.com

moderate inflammatory acne was conducted to evaluate efficacy
and safety of  xxxd3554xxx  (4 x 600 mg/d p.o. over 3 months).23
all patients provided written consent, had been off all topical and
oral acne therapy for at least 1 month, and none had received oral
isotretinoin or anabolic steroids. the use of cleansers and personal
care products were prohibited during the study. patients who
had atypical disease such as gram-negative folliculitis were not
included, nor were patients with any other disease, pregnant or
breast feeding females, any patients taking any other medications
or females using any form of hormonal contraception.
the acne was assessed by counting inflammatory lesions, being
the primary outcome measure, and non-inflammatory lesions
on the entire face and upper chest and back. acne severity was
determined by the method of allen and smith.26 patients were
photographed before and at the end of treatment. to obtain sebum
samples patients were always invited at 4 p.m., a defined central
area of the forehead was wiped twice with ethanol and sebum
samples (500 mul) were obtained one hour later, were suspended
in 600 mul ch3cl/ch3oh 2:1 and were split into aliquots.
total lipids and free  xxxd2154xxx  in sebum were measured by gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry, hydroperoxides in sebum
by a photometrical method based on the use of n,n-diethyl1,4-phenylene-diamine after comparison to the reaction of the
reference standard compound cumene hydroperoxide, and ltb4
in blood by a commercial ltb4 enzyme immunoassay system.
clinical assessments performed at the same time of the day were
made at baseline, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. laboratory assessments
were made at baseline and 12 weeks. although the study was not
double-blind the assessor did not have access to the previous or
other visit data until the study was completed.
in another case study, a 40-year-old female with histologically
confirmed, mild, disseminated sebaceous gland hyperplasia and
seborrhea on face, scalp and neck since puberty was treated with
 xxxd3554xxx  (4 x 600 mg/d o.o. over 3 weeks) after receiving written
consent.24 casual skin surface lipids (cssl) of the central forehead were measured at 4 p.m. using a computerized photometric
devise. to determine new sebum synthesis (nss), defined areas
of the central forehead and the left temple were wiped twice with
ethanol after measuring cssl. nss was detected 1 h later using
the device as described above.

conclusion
the involvement of products of the lt pathway in inflammatory skin diseases is well established.12  xxxg147xxx  and the other
enzymes which are involved in the lt pathway form a family
of lipid peroxidation enzymes and generate lipid mediators.10
on the other hand, lt are leukocyte chemotactic mediators with
ltb4 being the most potent among them.4 it increases neutrophil
adherence, as well as lysosomal release and generation of superoxide radicals. in addition, it activates complement and induces
interleukin production by neutrophils. intradermal injection of
ltb4 provokes the local attraction of neutrophils and monocytes.
there is increasing evidence that acne is a genuine inflammatory
disorder.1-4 since  xxxg147xxx  catalyzes the first step in aa metabolism
towards ltb4, we have considered the application of  xxxg147xxx 

dermato-endocrinology

inhibitors as a definitive step for modulation of lt effects in acne
patients. our pilot clinical study with systemic administration
of  xxxd3554xxx  in 10 patients with inflammatory acne has detected
anti-inflammatory and lipid reducing effects of the compound.23
searching for the primary effect, we have observed that  xxxd3554xxx 
inhibited the synthesis of sebaceous lipids in a patient with no
inflammatory signs.24 inhibition of lipid synthesis, especially of
pro-inflammatory lipids, is likely to be the major effect of  xxxd3554xxx 
on sebaceous glands followed by reduction of inflammatory
lesions in acne.23 the direct effect of  xxxd3554xxx  on the synthesis
of sebaceous lipids was confirmed in the in vitro study.
this effect was associated with the ability of  xxxd3554xxx  to reduce
il-6 release from sz95 sebocytes. in addition, pre-treatment with
 xxxd3554xxx  partially antagonised the short-term aa-induced induction of ltb4 release, increase of sebaceous lipids, and stimulation
of il-6 release.  xxxd3554xxx  ability to inhibit ltb4 formation in the
present study is in agreement with published data on inflammatory
cells.21 on the other hand,  xxxg147xxx  inhibitors may also downregulate the inflammatory activity of locally involved lymphocytes
and macrophages27 leading to the anti-inflammatory activity
which is clinically observed.
finally, a phase ii multicenter, clinical study in 101 patients
with mild to moderate inflammatory facial acne conducted in the
us showed a significant efficacy of  xxxd3554xxx  in a subset of patients
with moderate acne (baseline inflammatory lesions ≥30), whereas
those patients treated with  xxxd3554xxx  (n = 26) showed a mean
decrease in inflammatory lesions of 41.6% compared to 26.2% in
the placebo group (p = 0.025).28
in all clinical studies,  xxxd3554xxx  was found to be safe and well
tolerated.
in summary,  xxxd3554xxx  directly inhibits lipogenesis in human
sebocytes and prevents the activation of the leukotriene pathway
by aa.  xxxd3554xxx  inhibited sebum synthesis to a similar level
with that of low-dose isotretinoin.24 this is probably the most
intriguing aspect of our work and may seem difficult to explain.
however, an effect on ppars can be implicated.28 ltb4 is a
natural ligand for  xxxg1805xxx . the latter is shown to regulate lipid
and lipoprotein metabolism, inflammatory response, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of various cell types, including
sebaceous gland cells,29 providing a comprehensive link towards
the introduction of  xxxd3554xxx  in the treatment of sebaceous gland
diseases, and especially of acne.
