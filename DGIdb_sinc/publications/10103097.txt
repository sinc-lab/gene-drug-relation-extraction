abstract
in peripheral nerves, the function of acetylcholinesterase (ache) is not related to hydrolysis of acetylcholine. to test for a trophic
role, ache or its inhibitors were administered locally to normal and regenerating nerves of rats. in the normal nerve, neither ache
nor  xxxg124xxx  affected the cytological pattern of the nerve. bw284c51, a specific inhibitor of ache, resulted in demyelination,
proliferation of schwann cells and sprouting of axons after 5–7 days.  xxxd1968xxx  or  xxxd3027xxx , other specific inhibitors of ache,
did so to a much lesser extent. vehicle, and iso-ompa (inhibitor of pseudocholinesterases) did not affect the cytology of the nerve.
elongation of regenerating axons was evaluated at day 3 post-crush. native ache applied distal to the crush reduced the elongation
of regenerating axons (– 36%), while  xxxg124xxx , heated ache and filtered ache did not. bw284c51,  xxxd1968xxx  or
 xxxd3027xxx  enhanced the axonal elongation (33%) when they were administered for 2 days before, but not after, the crush. isoompa or vehicle administered before or after the crush were not effective. thus, ache reduces elongation of regenerating axons,
while inhibition of ache enhances elongation and affects the cytology of the normal nerve as well. we propose that ache has a
trophic role in mammalian peripheral nerves.

introduction
axons regulate schwann cells. during development, schwann cells
produce and maintain the myelin sheath when they contact the
appropriate axons, and remain in a postmitotic condition. mature
schwann cells destroy their myelin and proliferate when they lose
contact with their associated axons, as in wallerian degeneration
(bradley & asbury, 1970). thus, demyelination and proliferation
may be considered a response of the schwann cell when they are
released from axonal control. in recent years, neuregulins or glial
growth factors have been proposed to participate in the neuron-glia
signalling (bunge, 1993; dong et al., 1995; syroid et al., 1996;
grinspan et al., 1996). conversely, schwann cells regulate some
features of axons. in vitro, axons grow radially when schwann cells
develop the myelin sheath (windebank et al., 1985). in vivo, 1 week
after inhibition of rna synthesis in schwann cells, axons sprout
(bustos et al., 1991). thus, axonal sprouts may be considered a
response of axons when they are released from schwann cell
control. interestingly, the same events, i.e. schwann cell proliferation,
demyelination and sprouting of axons, follow the local inhibition of
extracellular proteases of the peripheral nerve (alvarez et al., 1992,
1995; moreno et al., 1996). these observations suggest that axons
and schwann cells regulate each other, and that an extracellular
protease participates in this regulation (tapia et al., 1995).
acetycholinesterase (ache) is a serine esterase whose best-known
function is the hydrolysis of acetylcholine in cholinergic synapses.
nevertheless, ache also occurs in extra-synaptic regions of the
nervous system, e.g. peripheral nerves, and even in cells not associated
with the nervous system, e.g. erythrocytes (toutant et al., 1989) or

hepatocytes (perelman & brandan, 1989). in peripheral nerves, most
of the ache moves within the axoplasm toward the terminals
(lubinska & niemierko, 1971; couraud & di giamberardino, 1980),
but a fraction belonging to the g4 form is bound to the axolemma
and faces the extracellular space (iurato et al., 1974; rotundo &
carbonetto, 1987; fernández et al., 1996). in recent years, ache has
been credited with actions that do not involve the breakdown of ach,
e.g. modulation of synaptic transmission in the striatum (greenfield,
1992), a trophic effect in cultured neurons (layer et al., 1993; jones
et al., 1995; small et al., 1995; dupree & bigbee, 1996; karpel
et al., 1996; srivatsan & peretz, 1997). recently, a toxic action has
been reported for ache. it reduces the survival of neuronal cell lines
neuro 2a and pc12 (calderón et al., 1998), and potentiates the toxic
action of the amyloid-beta peptide upon pc12 cells and retinal neurons
of the chick embryo (alvarez et al., 1998). no physiological role has
been suggested so far for ache of peripheral nerve trunks. considering the possibility of a trophic role, we supplied normal and
crushed nerves of the rat with ache, or its inhibitors, and studied
the effects upon the cytology of the nerve, and the elongation of
regenerating axons.

bovine g4 form, purified as described by inestrosa et al. (1987).
briefly, ache of the supernatant of the foetal caudate homogenate
was purified in acridinium–sepharose affinity column, washed and
eluted with  xxxd1820xxx  bromide. the specific activity was

6000 u/mg protein (ellman et al., 1961) and produced a single
66 kda band in sds–page.
bw284c51 was dissolved in dimethylsulphoxide and the final
concentration was adjusted with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs),
ph 7.4, to 1 mm for injection, and to 0.1 mm for osmotic pump.
 xxxd1968xxx  was adjusted with pbs, ph 7.4, to 1 mm, and  xxxd3027xxx ,
to 0.5 mm. iso-ompa was adjusted to yield 5 mm for injection, and
1 mm for osmotic pump. vehicle solutions were prepared in the same
manner, but omitting the active compound. bovine  xxxg124xxx 
was dissolved in saline to yield 0.6 µg/µl. the ache preparation
was dialysed against pbs, ph 7.4, to remove low molecular weight
solutes, and then adjusted to 250 mu/µl. as negative controls, ache
was filtered through a 10 kda millipore filter, or heated in a boiling
water bath for 3 min.

treatment of intact nerves
care of rats and procedures complied with nih guidelines. rats
(sprague–dawley, 200 g) were anaesthetized with nembutal (40 mg/
kg i.p.). when an osmotic pump (alza, palo alto, ca, usa; 1 µl/
h for 7 days) was used, it was placed under the skin of the back and
connected to the sciatic nerve trunk by means of a flexible silicone
tubing (dow corning, midland, mi, usa; medical grade), terminating
in a 4 mm cuff of the same material which was affixed around the
nerve. when subperineurial injections (2 µl) were given, the peroneal
nerve was exposed at the level of the popliteal fossa; with a hamilton
syringe fitted with a very fine steel needle, a bolus was injected so
that it moved centralward infiltrating 4–5 mm of nerve proximal to
the tip of the needle. the wound was then sutured and the rat returned
to the animal house. animals were allowed to survive for 3–9 days.
for details of schedules, see table 1.

treatment of regenerating nerves
the day of the crush is referred to as day 0 and the schedule of
subperineurial injections is shown in table 1. in anaesthetized rats,
the peroneal nerve was crushed two or three times for a few seconds
with jeweller tweezers, about 1–2 mm below the emergence of the
peroneal nerve from the sciatic trunk, to coincide with the upper limit
of the infiltrated zone. at the crush, a stitch (18 µm monofilament)
was left in the epineurium as a reference. the axonal elongation was
assessed with the pinch test at day 3 post-crush under light anaesthesia.
briefly, under the dissecting microscope, the peroneal nerve was
exposed and pinched with jeweller tweezers every 0.4 mm in a distalto-proximal direction. to avoid bias and because the abdomen was
beyond the field of view, another person assessed the reflex response
of the abdominal muscles. the distance between crush (stitch) and
site from which the reflex was evoked was taken as a measure of the
elongation of the regenerating axons. the rats were killed by cervical
dislocation.

electron microscopy
nerves were infiltrated with fixative (2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.01%
picric acid, phosphate buffer 0.1 m, ph 7.4), removed a few minutes
later, and left overnight in the same fixative. after a short rinse,
nerves were treated with buffered 1% osmium tetroxide for 2 h
followed by 2% uranyl acetate for 2 h; then they were dehydrated
with acetone, infiltrated and embedded with epon (for details, see
bustos et al., 1991). for light microscopy, sections were stained with
toluidine blue. for electron microscopy, thin sections were doublestained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. the region surveyed
included 4 mm proximal to, the middle of, and 4 mm distal to, the
treated nerve segment.

bw284c51 inhibits true ache and spares pseudocholinesterases
(chatonnet & lockridge, 1989). nerves were supplied with
bw284c51 by means of an osmotic pump (0.1 mm) or subperineurial
injections (1 mm), or vehicle (table 1), and studied 3, 5 and 8 days

later. in control nerves injected with vehicle, the infiltrated region
appeared normal except for a few demyelinated fibres, which
amounted to less than 1% of the population. in contrast, administration
of bw284c51 resulted in cytological alterations in the exposed region;
4 mm in a proximal direction the nerve was normal and the distal
nerve presented a few degenerating fibres probably due to mechanical
trauma produced by the subperineurial injection. in the treated
segment, alterations were not seen at day 3, but they were well
developed at days 5 and 8. the salient alterations consisted of
demyelination, proliferation of schwann cells, sprouting of myelinated
and non-medullated axons, and myelination of fine axons. a number
of other alterations was also observed, e.g. disarray of non-medullated
bundles, desmo- and hemidesmosome-like formations, and coated
pits and vesicles. altered fibres although present everywhere were
less frequent than those with normal appearance, suggesting that not

all the population was responding to the treatment at the same rate
or to the same extent.
demyelination, a major alteration observed in nerves treated with
bw284c51 (fig. 1), amounted to 10% of the myelinated fibres
[10.5 6 1.8 (4); x 6 sem (n)]. demyelinated fibres could be found
either grouped or solitary amid unaltered fibres. fibres fully demyelinated were found more often than those still holding debris. the
myelin sheath of a large axon could be reduced to a few lamellae
(fig. 1b), and in other cases the axon was surrounded mainly by the
basal lamina as if the schwann cell had retracted (fig. 1c).
schwann cells encompassing demyelinated fibres often exhibited
a nucleus, and even two or three cells, each one exhibiting its nucleus,
could cooperatively encompass the axon (fig. 2a). this contrasts
with the normal organization of the fibre in which schwann cells
surround axons one at a time along their length. the abundance of
nuclei, suggestive of proliferation, was confirmed by the presence of
schwann cells loaded with chromosomes (fig. 2b), identified by

their characteristic texture and occasional chunks of nuclear envelope
still attached to them. dividing schwann cells presented a normal
myelin sheath, were already demyelinated, or were non-myelinating
cells. the axons associated with these dividing cells presented an
axoplasm with a normal appearance (fig. 2). in control nerves,
the images described above were never observed. to estimate the
proliferative burst of schwann cells, we counted nuclei, as the
probability of finding a nucleus is a function of the number of cells.
in nerves injected with saline, the frequency of nuclei in myelinated
fibres was similar to that reported for untreated nerves (alvarez et al.,
1995). in nerves treated with bw284c51, nuclei of schwann cells
associated with demyelinated fibres increased by one order of magnitude, which implies over three mitosis per cell in the interval,
while cells with intact myelin presented a normal frequency of
nuclei (table 2).
under the electron microscope, axons are recognized by their
association with schwann cells, and a characteristic cytoplasm includ-

ing neurofilaments (intermediate filaments with side arms), microtubules and scattered membraneous organelles (mitochondria, vesicles,
cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum). in nerves treated with
bw284c51, myelinated fibres exhibiting a normal appearance could
present one or more small axonal profiles lying on the outer aspect
of the sheath, directly apposed to the basal lamina, or connected to
it by means of a mesaxon (fig. 3a). these additional axons do not
belong to the anatomy of the normal fibre (peters et al., 1991). as
they must be connected to a cell body, we conclude that they
correspond to sprouts of pre-existing axons. sprouts were associated
more frequently with fibres already demyelinated, i.e. a given schwann
cell was encompassing a major (parent) axon, and one or more axons
of varying sizes (sprouts; figs 3c and 4b). moreover, axons presenting
a deep but incomplete septum, suggestive of a branching point, were
also observed (fig. 3d). in non-medullated bundles, clusters of minute
axonal profiles shared a common groove (fig. 3e). these axonal
profiles do not belong to the normal anatomy of the bundle and have
been shown to correspond to sprouts (bustos et al., 1991).
fine axons surrounded by a few spirals or lamellae of compact
myelin were seen (fig. 4). these myelinating schwann cells were
usually free of myelin debris. thinly myelinated fibres were also
seen in an environment of non-medullated bundles as if one axon
had left the bundle to become myelinated (fig. 4c). in control nerves,
these images were never found.
in a normal non-medullated bundle, every axon is surrounded in
its entire perimeter by the satellite schwann cell. after exposure to
bw284c51, disorganized bundles of non-medullated fibres were
observed. axons touched the basal lamina or each other extensively
(fig. 5a). this was not observed in matched controls.
desmosome- and hemidesmosome-like structures do not belong to
the inventory of normal nerves (cf. peters et al., 1991). an extensive
survey of normal nerves revealed one or two desmosome-like formations at the most. in contrast, after bw284c51, these were found
without effort. in myelinating schwann cells, desmosome-like formations were seen in the outer mesaxon or in correspondence with

delaminated outer lamellae of the myelin sheath (figs 3a and 5b);
they were found usually single but sometimes several in a row
(fig. 3a), and tandem formations were a rarity (see fig. 5c). in nonmyelinating schwann cells, desmosome-like formations were seen
between schwann cell processes, and between the schwann cell and
axon (fig. 5d). hemidesmosome-like formations were found between
the basal lamina and plasma membrane of myelinating, demyelinated
and non-myelinating schwann cells (fig. 5d).
coated pits and vesicles were seen in schwann cells (figs 3c,d,
4b and 5a,e), and also in axons (fig. 2a). micropinocytic vesicles
were seen in axons (fig. 1c) and schwann cells. these membrane
formations were not observed in their matched controls. macrophages
were observed infrequently and those loaded with myelin debris were
a minority.
 xxxd1968xxx  and  xxxd3027xxx  are known to specifically inhibit
ache (chatonnet & lockridge, 1989).  xxxd1968xxx  (1 mm) and
 xxxd3027xxx  (0.5 mm) were injected into the nerve in three consecutive
days and the nerves processed 5–9 days later. these treatments
induced the same alterations as bw284c51 did (see figs 3b and 5c),
except that they were far less frequent. for example, demyelinated
fibres amounted to less than 2% of the population when  xxxd1968xxx 
or  xxxd3027xxx  were used, compared to 10% when bw284c51 was
used. iso-ompa inhibits pseudocholinesterases and spares true ache.
it was delivered continuously by means of an osmotic pump (1 mm)
to the sciatic nerve, or injected (5 mm) into the peroneal nerve. these
nerves, processed 4–7 days later, were in all respects similar to nerves
injected with saline (vide supra). native ache (250 mu/µl), filtered
ache and  xxxg124xxx  were also injected into the peroneal nerve
and processed 6–7 days later. no cytological effect was discerned in
these nerves either.

small (tapia et al., 1995). a first group of nerves was subjected to a
simple crush without further treatment; these are referred to as naive
regenerating nerves. other groups were crushed, and the distal
segment, i.e. the territory to be invaded by the regrowing axons, was
infiltrated with the compounds tested. bw284c51 (1 mm),  xxxd1968xxx  (1 mm),  xxxd3027xxx  (0.5 mm), or vehicle, injected in three consecutive days (0, 1 and 2) did not affect elongation (fig. 6). in contrast,
when the three injections preceded the lesion (days – 2, – 1 and 0),
the same ache inhibitors enhanced the axonal elongation by 33%
(p , 0.001) compared to nerves conditioned in the same manner
with vehicle or iso-ompa (5 mm), the elongation of which was
similar to that of naive nerves (fig. 6).
other groups of nerves were crushed and the distal region infiltrated
with native (250 mu/µl), filtered or heated ache, or bovine serum
albumin. native ache reduced the elongation of axons by 36%
(p , 0.001) compared to nerves treated with filtered ache, heated
ache or  xxxg124xxx ; the elongation of the latter groups was
similar to that of naive nerves (fig. 6). summing up, exogenous
ache reduced the elongation of axons, and inhibitors of endogenous
ache increased the elongation when they were administered prior
to, but not at the time of, the crush.
the cytological pattern of naive degenerating nerves consisted of
all shades of orphan schwann cells, disrupted myelin sheaths, digested
axoplasms and scattered macrophages. the degeneration patterns of

nerves injected with saline, native ache, filtered ache, heated
ache, bw284c51,  xxxd1968xxx ,  xxxd3027xxx  or iso-ompa, were on
gross inspection similar to that of naive nerves. if differences in
degeneration between treatments existed, they went unnoticed owing
to the wide spectrum of alterations.
along with degeneration, a regenerating response was observed.
close to the front, as determined by the pinch test, naive nerves
presented clusters of a few to a dozen or more small axonal profiles,
sometimes including a large profile. towards the crush, the clusters
included fewer profiles to the profit of the larger one (fig. 7a). the
sprouts were associated with schwann cells whose cytoplasm encased
myelin debris or not, but also they were naked, surrounded only by
the basal lamina. the pattern of regenerating axons close to the front
was not modified by treatment with saline, filtered ache, heated
ache,  xxxg124xxx  or iso-ompa, in that the clusters of axonal
profiles were found easily and the larger profiles were seen as in
naive nerves. the same pattern was also observed in nerves treated
with bw284c51,  xxxd1968xxx  and  xxxd3027xxx  supplied at the time
of the crush. however, when these inhibitors were supplied prior to
the crush, the pattern changed. sprouts were abundant and the large
axonal profiles, often alone, were frequent and larger than in controls
(fig. 7c,d), implying that the axon was growing radially and pruning
the excess of neurites. native ache administered after the crush also
affected the pattern of regeneration, but in the opposite way, i.e. it

reduced the number of clusters; an extensive survey was necessary to
find them, and the larger profiles within the cluster were a rarity
(fig. 7b). thus, the treatments that affected the extent of the axonal elongation also affected the cytological pattern of regeneration.

discussion
our main observations were that: (i) in intact nerves, bw284c51, a
specific inhibitor of ache, considerably altered the cytology of the
fibres and induced schwann cells to proliferate; and (ii) in regenerating
nerves, ache reduced axonal elongation, while specific inhibitors of
ache administered prior to the crush enhanced the elongation. we will
discuss the possible role of ache in the maintenance of the normal
nerve and during regeneration.
inhibition of ache by bw284c51, a specific inhibitor, broke the
cytological organization of the nerve fibre. schwann cells destroyed
their myelin, showed adhesive formations alien to the normal pattern
and proliferated, and axons sprouted. these cytological responses seem
to be tightly bound, as the same pattern is found after administration
of protease inhibitors (alvarez et al., 1995; moreno et al., 1996) or
cerebrospinal fluid of tropical spastic paraparesis patients (schmidt
et al., 1996; nien et al., 1998). axons have a programme to sprout
which is expressed when the repression exerted by the differentiated
schwann cells is removed (bustos et al., 1991; tapia et al., 1995;
nien et al., 1998). on the other hand, schwann cells demyelinate and
proliferate as soon as they lose contact with axons (bradley & asbury,
1970). descriptively, bw284c51 breaks the reciprocal regulation of
the axon and schwann cell. as the primary target of bw284c51 is
ache, bw284c51 is likely to impair this reciprocal regulation by
inhibiting ache. this suggests that ache has a trophic role. that isoompa, inhibitor of pseudocholinesterases, affected neither cytology
nor regeneration lends further support to the notion of a specific role of
ache in the sphere of trophic interactions. (for the lack of a substantial
effect of  xxxd1968xxx  and  xxxd3027xxx  on the normal nerve, vide infra.)
the disarray of axons and schwann cells following bw284c51

administration also suggests a trophic disruption. in fact, cell adhesion
is determined by genetic programmes, and genetic programmes are
regulated by cell adhesion. in our experiments, the abnormal contacts
of non-medullated axons and the presence of desmo- and hemidesmosome-like formations are likely to reflect the new programmes being
expressed. trophic actions are mediated by transduction pathways, and
coated pits and vesicles are the morphological expression of internalization of activated receptors. the abundance of these formations after
bw284c51 administration is consistent with a trophic action triggered
by the inhibition of ache. finally, that exogenous ache did not affect
the cytology of the nerve can be accounted for by assuming that the
tissue was already responding to the endogenous ache.
axons specify schwann cells to develop myelin and to remain in a
differentiated postmitotic condition, and mature schwann cells repress
the sprouting drive of axons (see above). thus, ache would participate
in the regulatory loop between the axon and schwann cell, and
bw284c51 breaks this loop. to our knowledge this is the first report of
a specific inhibitor of ache that is able to induce a local neuropathy in
peripheral nerves. however, that inhibitors of esterases induce neuropathies is not new. organophosphates, that inhibit a brain ‘neuropathy
target esterase’ different from ache, are known to induce a delayed
neuropathy (lotti, 1991). this suggests that esterases play a role in the
structural stability of the nerve tissue.
nerve repair is a macroscopic manifestation of trophic processes in
action. bw284c51 is expected to affect nerve repair as it affects the
trophic balance of the normal nerve. under the effect of bw284c51,
regrowth was enhanced and axons were more mature than controls,
whereas native ache produced the reverse effect, i.e. reduced length
and maturity of sprouts. these results further support the notion of a
trophic action of ache in the peripheral nerve.
we want to highlight two observations of regenerating nerves treated
with inhibitors of ache. first, treatments have to precede the crush for
over a day to enhance regrowth. second, treatments have to condition
the territory to be invaded by the sprouts. both observations suggest
that ache affects the axon indirectly. aprotinin, an inhibitor of serine
proteases, duplicates this pattern, as it enhances the axonal regrowth
only when the territory to be invaded is conditioned for 2 days prior to
the crush (tapia et al., 1995). axons of wlds (c57bl/ola) mice do not
regenerate for several weeks (lunn et al., 1989), but they do so when
the resident cells of the distal stump are destroyed mechanically (brown
et al., 1994) or with  xxxd1800xxx  (benavides & alvarez, 1998).
taking these observations together, we propose that inhibitors of ache
trigger a cascade of processes in the resident cells of the nerve that after
a day or so result in an environment favourable for axonal elongation.
our results extend the trophic role of ache proposed for neurons in
culture to peripheral nerves in vivo. the final effects, though, seem to be
opposite. ache impairs, and its inhibitors enhance, axonal elongation
in vivo, while the opposite occurs in vitro. in vitro, bw284c51 reduces
neurite growth of dorsal root ganglion neurons, and impairs the removal
of filaments accumulated in the cell bodies (dupree & bigbee, 1996).
in mid-brain dopaminergic neurons, ache enhances neurite outgrowth
while bw284c51 reduces the number of neurons, and in the surviving
ones, reduces the cell body size and extent of neurite outgrowth (jones
et al., 1995). in chick neurons, ache stimulates (small et al., 1995)
and bw284c51 decreases (layer et al., 1993) neurite outgrowth. in
aplysia neurons, ache promotes and bw284c51 impairs neurite outgrowth (srivatsan & peretz, 1997). ache notwithstanding also has
deleterious effects. the survival of neuro 2a and pc12 cell lines is
shortened by ache (calderón et al., 1998), and the toxic action of the
amyloid-beta peptide upon pc12 cells and retinal neurons of the chick is
potentiated (alvarez et al., 1998). the different trophic actions of ache
in living nerves and in vitro may be due to the region of the cell exposed

to the agents; to an intervening agent present in the tissue; or to intrinsic
differences in the cells studied. in cultured neurons, ache or its inhibitors affect the whole nerve cell, whereas in the present experiments,
the agents act upon sprouts and resident cells of the invaded territory,
but not upon the rest of the neuron. in addition, regrowing axons in vivo
are exposed to many agents, e.g. extracellular matrix, schwann cells,
cytokines, invading cells, etc. in the complex in vivo system, ache is
likely to act upon the growing axons through an intervening physiological agent, as treatments basically affected the territory to be invaded by
axons and required a substantial latency.
the mechanism by which ache inhibitors affect the nerve is puzzling. bw284c51,  xxxd1968xxx  and  xxxd3027xxx  inhibit ache selectively
but in different ways.  xxxd1968xxx  blocks the active site (wilson &
quan, 1958),  xxxd3027xxx  blocks the peripheral anionic site (taylor &
lappi, 1975), and bw284c51 blocks both (barak et al., 1994). while
all three inhibitors enhance the elongation of regenerating axons to the

same extent, only bw284c51 substantially affects the cytology of the
nerve. in neurons in vitro, inhibitors of ache do not consistently induce
the same trophic effect. for example, in aplysia, rat and chick neurons,
bw284c51 reduces the outgrowth of neurites, but  xxxd1962xxx  and
 xxxd2393xxx  do not (layer et al., 1993; jones et al.,
1995; small et al., 1995; srivatsan & peretz, 1997). thus, the trophic
activity of ache in mammalian nerves seems unrelated to its ability to
hydrolyse acetylcholine, but whether it relates to a non-enzymatic
function (cf. massoulié et al., 1993) remains an open question.
in conclusion: (i) in intact nerves, bw284c51, a specific inhibitor of
ache activity, induces schwann cells to proliferate and demyelinate,
and axons to sprout, while administration of exogenous ache is innocuous; (ii) in regenerating nerves, exogenous ache reduces axonal
elongation, while three inhibitors of ache enhance axonal elongation.
we propose that ache has a trophic role in peripheral nerve fibres
unrelated to hydrolysis of acetylcholine.
