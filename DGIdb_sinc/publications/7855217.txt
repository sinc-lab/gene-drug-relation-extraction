abstract. using radioligand binding assays and postm o r t e m normal h u m a n brain tissue, we obtained equilibrium dissociation constants (kds) for 17 antidepressants and two of their metabolites at histamine h~, muscarinic, ~-adrenergic, ~2-adrenergic, dopamine d2, serotonin 5-htia, and serotonin 5-ht 2 receptors. several
newer antidepressants were compared with older drugs.
in addition, we studied some antimuscarinic, antiparkinson, antihistamine, and neuroleptic compounds at some
of these receptors. for the antidepressants, classical tricyclic antidepressants were the most potent drugs at five
of the seven receptors (all but ~2-adrenergic and 5-ht1a
receptors). the chlorophenylpiperazine derivative antidepressants (etoperidone, nefazodone, trazodone) were
the most potent antidepressants at u2-adrenergic and  xxxg1108xxx  receptors. of ten antihistamines tested, none was
more potent than doxepin at histamine h~ receptors. at
muscarinic receptors antidepressants and antihistamines
had a range of potencies, which were mostly weaker than
those for antimuscarinics. f r o m the in vitro data, we expect  xxxd84xxx , bupropion, fluoxetine, sertraline, tomoxetine, and venlafaxine not to block any of these five
receptors in vivo. an antidepressant's potency for blocking a specific receptor is predictive of certain side effects
and drug-drug interactions. these studies can provide
guidelines for the clinician in the choice of antidepressant.
key words: histamine hi receptor - muscarinic receptor
- ~ - a d r e n o c e p t o r , ~2-adrenoceptor - d o p a m i n e d 2 receptor - serotonin 5- xxxd764xxx  receptor - serotonin 5-ht 2
receptor -- antihistamines - antimuscarinics - neuroleptics

(richelson 1993). researchers can determine the potency
of a drug for a specific receptor by obtaining the equilibrium dissociation constant (kd) with a radioligand
binding assay.
since we last reported the results of this type of study,
several new antidepressants have become available for
use in the united states. a m o n g those are sertraline and
paroxetine (fig. 1). along with fluoxetine, these drugs
have been classified as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris), a term that refers to their selective inhibition of the neuronal re-uptake mechanism for serotonin c o m p a r e d t.o that for norepinephrine. therefore, we
wanted to find the binding potencies of these and some
additional c o m p o u n d s at seven different receptors in hum a n brain. we evaluated 17 antidepressants and two of
their metabolites at the muscarinic, histamine h1, ~ladrenergic, ~a-adrenergic, dopamine d2, serotonin  xxxg1108xxx  , and serotonin 5-ht 2 receptors. additionally, we
examined a series of antimuscarinic, antiparkinson, antihistamine, and neuroteptic c o m p o u n d s at some of these
receptors.

methods and materials
tissue preparation. normal human brain tissue was obtained at the
time of autopsy, on average 6 h after death, and stored in a liquid
nitrogen refrigerator until it was homogenized in 10 vol of ice-cold
50 mm nakpo4 buffer, ph = 7.4, using a brinkmann homogenizer,
model pt 10/30 (10 s, setting 6). the homogenate was spun at
38 000 g for 10 min in a beckman model j2-21 centrifuge. the pellets were resuspended in fresh nakpo4 buffer and spun again at
38 000 g. the final pellets were resuspended in nakpo4, diluted to
a concentration of 10 mg wet wt/ml and stored at -70°c until just
before assay. for use in the radioligand binding assay, adequate
amounts of tissue homogenates were thawed and spun as above.
the pellets were resuspended in fresh nakpo4 buffer (ph = 7.4) in
a volume that would provide the appropriate tissue weights in
0.1 ml aliquots (table 1). for 5htia assays the tissue homogenate
of human cortex was processed further as described before (peroutka 1986).

antidepressants are antagonists of m a n y neurotransmitter receptors in h u m a n brain (richelson and nelson
1984a; wander et al. 1986). the potency of this blockade
can be used to predict the likelihood of adverse side effects and drug-drug interactions in clinical practice

radioligands and conditions for the different receptors. incubation
of assay mixture for the 5htia receptor was at 25°c for 30 min. all
other assay incubations were at 37°c for 60 min. after incubation
the samples were rapidly filtered under vacuum using whatman
gf/b filters and a brandel cell harvester. the tubes and filters
were routinely rinsed with 5 x 1.5 ml ice-cold 0.9%  xxxg2020xxx . the filters
were placed in minivials and 7 ml scintillation fluid was added.
after the samples stood for 5 h, the radioactivity was measured
using a beckman ls5000 liquid scintillation counter. specific binding to the receptor was calculated as the difference between the total
binding (zero unlabeled ligand) and nonspecific binding (excess unlabeled ligand).
data analysis. the data were analyzed using the ligand program
(munson and rodbard 1980) to calculate equilibrium dissociation
constants (ka). the program has been modified by us to provide the
hilt coefficient. geometric mean of the ka (fleming et al. 1972) and
its standard error (de lean et al. 1982) were calculated. unless
noted otherwise, we present mean values from at least three independent experiments, each done in duplicate.

results
the data for the equilibrium dissociation constants for
antidepressants at seven different receptors are presented
in table 2. the compounds are presented alphabetically.
reference compounds are also presented at the bottom of
this table. hill coefficients for all compounds at all receptors were essentially equal to unity, showing that binding
of these drugs obeyed the law of mass action.

histamine h~ receptor
we used [ xxxd3050xxx  to study the histamine h 1 receptor of human brain frontal cortex. for  xxxd3050xxx 
( xxxd3050xxx ) the ka found in 19 independent experiments was 3.3_+0.2 nm. figure 2a illustrates competition curves for some antidepressants at the histamine
 xxxg1078xxx  in human brain. among the antidepressants
studied, doxepin and amitriptyline were very potent
(table 2).  xxxd84xxx  and venlafaxine were essentially
inactive. the neuroleptic  xxxd2956xxx  had a ka of
24_+3 rim.
we also determined kas for several antihistamines,
some of which were newer generation compounds. the
compounds (geometric mean of kd _+sem) were  xxxd236xxx  (2.02 + 0.05 nm),  xxxd3050xxx  (3.3 _+0.2 nm),  xxxd375xxx  (6.06+0.09nm), and terfenadine (9.7+
0.6 nm). none was more potent than the tricyclic antidepressants doxepin and amitriptyline.

muscarinic receptor
for studying the muscarinic receptor, we used the human
caudate nucleus and the radioligand [3h]quinuclidinyl
benzilate (kd=28 ± 1 pm, n= 11). qnb is a nonselective
muscarinic antagonist, having about equal affinity for the
five subtypes of muscarinic receptors (bolden et al. 1992).
representative competition curves are illustrated in
fig. 2b. amitriptyline and doxepin were the most potent
antidepressant antagonists, with kas = 9.6 and 23 rim, respectively (table 2). several compounds ( xxxd84xxx ,
bupropion, etoperidone, trazodone, and venlafaxine)
were practically without activity. we also determined the
binding potency of a series of antimuscarinic, antiparkinson, antihistamine, and neuroleptic compounds (table 3).
 xxxd2965xxx  has some selectivity for ml receptors (buckley et al. 1989). af=dx 116 has some selectivity for m 2

receptors (buckley et al. 1989). in our studies with the five
molecularly cloned muscarinic receptors (stanton et al.
1993), we found no antidepressant selective for a given
subtype of muscarinic receptor. data for the neuroleptic
 xxxd1679xxx  (table 3) suggest that it is among the
most potent for this class of compounds at blocking muscarinic receptors (richelson and nelson 1984b; bolden et
al. 1992).
al-adrenoceptor
to study the ~l-adrenoceptor, we used the radioligand
[3h] xxxd3000xxx , which had a k d = 0.11 __0.01 nm (n = 11).
 xxxd3000xxx  appears to be nonselective for el-adrenoceptor
subtypes (morrow and creese 1986). the antidepressants
with the most potent binding at this receptor were doxepin and amitriptyline, which were equipotent
(kds = 24 nm), and imipramine (table 2). representative
competition curves are illustrated in fig. 2c.  xxxd84xxx  and venlafaxine were the least potent competitive
antagonists at this receptor and essentially inactive. additionally, we tested the binding potency of the neuroleptic  xxxd2956xxx  at this receptor and found a kd----76 + 5 nm.
a2-adrenoceptor
the radioligand, [3h]rauwolscine, had a k d = 3 . 6 +
0.1 nm, which was the most potent compound tested.
rauwolscine appears to be nonselective for ~2-adrenoceptor subtypes (bylund et al. 1992). in addition, under
the conditions of our assay, serotonin (up to 10 ~m) and
buspirone (up to 0.1 gm) had no effect on [3h]rauwolscine binding, contrary to the results of others
(convents et al. 1989).
this radioligand was competitively antagonized by
antidepressants (for examples, see fig. 2d). none of the
antidepressants studied was very potent at the 0~2-adrenoceptor (table 2). of the antidepressants studied, the most
potent compounds were the structurally related
chlorophenylpiperazine derivatives trazodone, etoperidone, and nefazodone. these were modestly potent, while
 xxxd84xxx , bupropion, and venlafaxine were practically
without activity.

 xxxg1108xxx  receptor
for this receptor the radioligand chosen was [3h]8-hydroxy-dpat. this compound was the most potent with
a kd=0.46_+0.01 nm. de vos et al. (1991) suggested that
rauwolscine is an agonist at this receptor. in our experiments rauwolscine had a kd = 7 _+1 nm at this receptor,
and therefore was not as potent as the agonists 8-hydroxy-dpat, or 5-ht (ka=0.72+0.03 nm). [3h]8-hydroxy-dpat was competitively antagonized by antidepressants (for examples, see fig. 2e). among the antidepressants tested, again the three chlorophenylpiperazines
nefazodone, etoperidone, and trazodone were the most
potent (table 2). more than half the drugs evaluated were
weak competitive antagonists in these radioligand binding studies.

(k a = 3.7 .+0.1 nm),
 xxxd2956xxx 
(kd-=-29 ___4rim), and melperone (kd= 620___30 nm)
had the highest affinity for the d 2 receptor. [3h]spiperone was competitively antagonized by antidepressants (for examples, see fig. 2g). in comparison to all but
the atypical neuroleptic melperone, all of the antidepressants studied were weak antagonists of the  xxxg656xxx .
the most potent antidepressant was doxepin with a
k a = 360___60 nm, while the least potent were  xxxd84xxx , bupropion, tomoxetine, and venlafaxine (table 2).
two additional antidepressants were tested only at this
receptor. these were fluvoxamine with a kd=770
_+60nm and trimipramine with a kd=210-+20nm.
trimipramine, which has an affinity for these receptors
nearly as potent as that for the atypical neuroleptic clozapine (richelson and nelson 1984b), is also being considered as an atypical neuroleptic (eikmeier et al. 1991).
discussion

in this study we obtained data for a series of antidepressants and two of their metabolites at seven different receptor types in human brain tissue. these receptors included the histamine hi, muscarinic acetylcholine, ~ and ~a-adrenergic, dopamine d2, and  xxxg1108xxx  and 5ht 2
serotonergic receptors. we previously reported results for
some of these antidepressants (richelson and nelson
1984a; wander et al. 1986). our results from the present
study compare well with those from the earlier studies.
the present study includes some newer, second generation compounds (fig. 1), especially the ssris and some
of their metabolites.
among the ssri metabolites, only fluoxetine and sertraline were available for us to test. the most potent of
this group at blocking uptake of serotonin is paroxetine,

while the most selective is sertraline (bolden-watson and
richelson 1993). although the older compound trazodone is an ssri, it is weaker than some non-ssris at
blocking re-uptake of serotonin. in addition, it is much
more potent at blocking serotonin receptors (table 2 and
wander et al. 1986) than it is at blocking uptake of serotonin (bolden-watson and richelson 1993). thus, its net
effect is to decrease serotoninergic neurotransmission
(fuller et al. 1984).
from our results presented here, we can make some
generalizations when considering all the antidepressants
as a group. first, their most potent receptor blocking
effects were at the histamine h~ receptor. currently, of all
classes of compounds, the most potent drugs available at
blocking the human  xxxg1078xxx  are the tricyclic antidepressants doxepin, amitriptyline, and trimipramine (cf. table 2, kanba and richelson 1984; richelson and nelson 1984a,b). second, the classical tricyclic
antidepressants were the most potent compounds at
blocking five of these seven receptors. the exceptions
were at the ~2-adrenoceptor and the  xxxg1108xxx  receptor,
where chlorophenylpiperazines were the most potent
(table 2). third, most of the newer compounds were very
weak at blocking neurotransmitter receptors. this last
fact can explain why the newer compounds have significantly fewer of the side effects seen with the older compounds, especially the classical tricyclic antidepressants.
venlafaxine was essentially without activity at all seven receptors (table 2). however, from a practical standpoint, there were many other compounds that would not
likely affect any of these seven receptors directly in vivo.
these compounds included  xxxd84xxx , bupropion, fluoxetine, sertraline, and tomoxetine.
the new ssri paroxetine was excluded from this list
because of its relatively high potency at blocking muscarinic receptors. it was the most potent of the newer
compounds at blocking this receptor, with an affinity
close to that of imipramine (table 2). these results are
supported by our data from studies with the five cloned
human muscarinic receptors (stanton et al. 1993). in this
study paroxetine was most potent at the  xxxg449xxx 
(kd = 80 nm) and was four to eight fold less potent at the
other four receptors. the  xxxg449xxx  is highly expressed
in glandular tissue. these data may explain the observation that paroxetine causes dry mouth in patients at an
incidence, although low, significantly greater than does
placebo (smith and glaudin 1992).
molecular cloning studies have proven the existence
of multiple subtypes of not only the muscarinic, but also
the adrenergic and serotonin receptors. well before we
understand the functions of all these receptor subtypes,
future research of the type reported by stanton et al.
(1993) will show whether antidepressants have selectivity
for any of these subtypes.
drugs that potently block certain receptors may cause
particular adverse effects and potential drug-drug interactions in patients (richelson 1993). for example,  xxxg1078xxx  blockade may cause sedation and
drowsiness and the potentiation of central depressant
drugs. muscarinic receptor blockade may cause blurred
vision and memory dysfunction. blockade of ~l-adrenoceptors may cause postural hypotension, while blockade
