abstract
previous reports have shown that an intracisternal ži.c.. injection of acetylcholine in the dog increases both arterial blood pressure and
plasma levels of noradrenaline and vasopressin via central muscarinic receptors. the aim of the present study was to characterize the
central muscarinic cholinoceptor subtypes involved in such central cholinergic responses in anesthetized male beagle–harrier dogs
ž n s 12.. for this purpose, we studied the relative potency of various muscarinic receptor antagonists to block the acetylcholine-induced
pressor responses ž30 mg kgy1 i.c... the acetylcholine-induced pressor response was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the i.c.
administration of the non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine žid50 s 0.5 mg kgy1 ., the muscarinic m 1 receptor antagonist
 xxxd2965xxx  žid50 s 0.45 mg kgy1 ., the muscarinic m 2 receptor antagonist methoctramine žid50 s 8.5 mg kgy1 . and the muscarinic m 3
receptor antagonist para-fluoro-hexahydro-sila- xxxd1907xxx  žid50 s 43.7 mg kgy1 .. the order of potency of these four muscarinic receptor
antagonists was: atropines  xxxd2965xxx ) methoctramine4 para-fluoro-hexahydro-sila- xxxd1907xxx . in order to confirm the selectivity for
muscarinic m 1 receptors of this dose of  xxxd2965xxx , we checked that 40- to 50-fold higher concentrations were necessary to block a
typical muscarinic m 2 receptor response žbradycardia. and a typical muscarinic m 3 receptor response žendothelial vasodilation.
compared with methoctramine and para-fluoro-hexahydro-sila- xxxd1907xxx , respectively. these results suggest that the pressor response
elicited by intracisternal injection of acetylcholine in anesthetized beagle–harrier dogs is mediated through the activation of the
muscarinic m 1 cholinoceptor subtype. q 1999 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
the first in-depth study of central cholinergic involvement in cardiovascular regulation was reported by suh et

on one hand, previous reports suggest that the central
cholinergic cardiovascular effects of physostigmine in rats
žbrezenoff et al., 1988; lazartigues et al., 1998a,b. and
anesthetized cats žally et al., 1995. are possibly mediated
through an activation of the muscarinic m 2 cholinoceptor
subtype in the central nervous system. on another hand,
hori et al. ž1995. reported a muscarinic m 1 receptor-mediated increase in blood pressure following intrahippocampal
neostigmine injection in rat. to our best knowledge, the
characterization of the muscarinic cholinoceptor subtypežs.
involved in the pressor response to i.c. acetylcholine has
not yet been performed in dogs.
the aim of this study was to identify which subtypežs.
of muscarinic cholinoceptoržs. is žare. involved in the
central cardiovascular responses elicited by acetylcholine
in anesthetized dogs. for this purpose, the effects of the
non-selective muscarinic cholinoceptor antagonist, atropine
and those of the partially selective muscarinic cholinoceptor antagonists  xxxd2965xxx , ža muscarinic m 1 receptor
antagonist., methoctramine ža muscarinic m 2 receptor antagonist. and p-f-hhsid ža muscarinic m 3 receptor antagonist. were investigated on acetylcholine-induced pressor
response.

on the first group of dogs ž n s 6., we assessed the
cardiovascular and hormonal effects of a standard dose of
acetylcholine ž30 mg kgy1 , i.c., n s 6., in comparison
with those of a saline i.c. injection ž0.3 ml, n s 6.. the
inhibition of this pressor response was also verified following pretreatment with atropine ž0.5–2 mg kgy1 , i.c., n s 6.
as previously reported by brefel et al. ž1995.. these
parameters were measured at five different times: 10 and 5
min before žt-10 and t-5., then 5, 15 and 25 min žt5, t15
and t25. after i.c. injection.

2. materials and methods

2.3. effects of selectiõe muscarinic cholinoceptors
antagonists

2.1. general protocol
experiments were performed on two groups of six
anesthetized beagle–harrier male dogs žd’ambrieres, aze,
france. weighing 10 to 15 kg. the dogs were fasted on the
morning of the experiment but had free access to water ad
libitum in order to be normally hydrated. all animals
procedures were conducted in strict compliance with approved french agriculture department for animal use for
research and education protocols.
animals were anesthetized with a-chloralose ž100 mg
kgy1 , i.v.., intubated and ventilated with an ideal palmer
respirator žinsufflated air volume: 15 ml kgy1 with a
frequency of 16 miny1 ..
the degree of anesthesia was evaluated by the lack of
eyelid reflex, the lack of reactions to any external stimulus
and the stability of cardiovascular parameters. body temperature of the animal was maintained at a constant level
of 388c. a catheter was introduced into the left femoral
artery at the beginning of the experiment. it was connected
to a statham p23db transducer to monitor systolic and
diastolic blood pressure and was removed at the end of
each experiment. heart rate was counted on the electrocardiogram žlead ii.. these parameters were continuously
recorded on a beckman recorder žtype r411.. a cannula
was also inserted into the cisterna magna žbetween c1 and
the skull.. the proper position of the cannula within the
cisterna magna was demonstrated by the flow of cerebrospinal fluid into the cannula.

the collection of experimental data started 10 min after
the insertion of the intracisternal ži.c.. cannula to allow
cardiovascular parameters to return to basal values after
this potentially stressful event.
blood samples for catecholamines and vasopressin
plasma levels assays were obtained from the femoral artery.
the volume of blood removed for plasma assay was
immediately replaced by an equivalent volume ž10 ml. of
isotonic saline.
2.2. cardioõascular and hormonal effects of i.c.
acetylcholine in the dog

in order to determine the subtypežs. of central muscarinic cholinoceptoržs. involved in the acetylcholine-induced pressor response ž30 mg kgy1 ., we randomly administered in a second group of dogs ž n s 6., various
muscarinic receptor antagonists by i.c. route, 10 min prior
to the standard acetylcholine i.c. injection. at least three
doses of each antagonist žpirenzepine: 0.5–20 mg kgy1 ,
i.c.; methoctramine: 1–20 mg kgy1 , i.c.; and para-fluorohexahydro-sila- xxxd1907xxx  žp-f-hhsid.: 10–50 mg kgy1 ,
i.c.. were tested in at least five experiments. for each
point, five or fewer experiments were performed in the
same dog.
a 10-day wash-out interval was respected between each
i.c. injection.
in order to confirm that the muscarinic receptor antagonists remained selectives at the dose used, we assessed in
six conscious dogs, their relative potencies on two well
known cholinergic responses: first, the tachycardia elicited
by blockade of muscarinic m 2 cardiac receptors žvan
zwieten et al., 1995. and secondly, the decrease in blood
pressure measured as a consequence of vasodilation induced by the stimulation of muscarinic m 3 endothelial
receptors žboulanger et al., 1994..
2.4. measurement of catecholamines and õasopressin
plasma leõels
all measurements were done blind. for catecholamines
plasma levels determination, blood was collected in

m. pelat et al.r european journal of pharmacology 379 (1999) 117–124

lithium-heparin tubes. for noradrenaline, the tubes contained 10 mm of sodium metabisulphite. blood samples
were then centrifuged at 4000 = g for 15 min at 08c.
plasma was stored at y808c. noradrenaline and vasopressin levels were measured as previously described by
brefel et al. ž1995..
2.5. drugs
the following drugs were used: a-chloralose žprolabo,
paris, france.,  xxxd247xxx  ža non-selective muscarinic
receptor antagonist.,  xxxd2965xxx  žsigma, st. quentin
fallavier, france., methoctramine and p-f-hhsid žrbi,
natick, usa.. all the drugs were dissolved in physiological saline excepted for p-f-hhsid which was dissolved in 10% ethanol žthe vehicle was tested to make sure
that it did not induce, by itself, any effect on blood
pressure and heart rate..
2.6. statistical analysis
according to the homogeneity of variances, a one-way
analysis of variance žanova., followed by a scheffe’s
post-hoc test, was performed to compare baseline values of
the different parameters, in each protocol, in order to
assess if there was any significant intergroup difference.
a paired-sample student’s t-test was used to compare
the different parameters, before and after pretreatment by
the i.c. injection of saline or the muscarinic receptor
antagonists, in order to assess if this pretreatment induced
any effects by itself. an anova for repeated measures,
followed by a dunnett’s post-hoc test was used to compare
the mean variations ž d . of the different parameters at the
different times, in each treatment group, in order to assess
the acetylcholine-induced pressor response. dose–response
curves were fitted by a non-linear regression to a sigmoıdal
¨
and id50 calculated using the program prism žgraphpad
software, san diego, ca, usa.. values are expressed as
means" s.e.m. the level of significance was accepted for
p - 0.05.

3. results
the baseline values for cardiovascular and hormonal
parameters were not significantly different before i.c. injections in each group of dogs žtable 1.. saline induced no

significant change in any parameter following i.c. injection
at any time ždata not shown..
3.1. effects of the i.c. injection of acetylcholine on
cardioõascular and hormonal responses
the i.c. injection of acetylcholine induced, within 5
min, a significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood
pressure žq38 " 7 mmhg, q28 " 4 mmhg, respectively,
anova p - 0.05. and remained increased up to 15 min
after administration, until values returned progressively to
baseline within 25 min žfig. 1a..
noradrenaline and vasopressin plasma levels were also
significantly modified by acetylcholine žfig. 1b.. at t5
and t15 min, following acetylcholine administration, noradrenaline plasma levels were significantly increased
žq275 " 41 pg mly1 , q152 " 5 pg mly1 , respectively,
anova p - 0.05.. conversely, vasopressin plasma levels were only significantly increased at t15 min.
3.2. effects of the muscarinic receptor antagonists
the different antagonists used in the study induced no
significant change by themselves on any measured parameters, excepted for methoctramine. indeed, the highest dose
ž20 mg kgy1 . of this muscarinic m 2 receptor antagonist
induced a significant increase in both systolic and diastolic
blood pressure and vasopressin plasma levels žq21 " 3
and q13 " 3 mmhg and q22 " 10 pg mly1 , respectively, p - 0.05.. the same dose of this muscarinic m 2
receptor antagonist, induced no significant change in noradrenaline plasma levels.
3.3. effects of the different muscarinic receptor
antagonists on the acetylcholine-induced pressor and
hormonal responses
the four muscarinic antagonists blocked in a dose-dependent way the increase in blood pressure evoked by
acetylcholine.
pretreatment of the dogs by an i.c. injection of three
doses: 0.5, 1, 2 mg kgy1 of atropine resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the peak acetylcholine ž30 mg kgy1 .
effects on blood pressure ž p - 0.05.. dose–response
curves analysis showed that atropine had an id50 equal to
0.5 mg kgy1 žfig. 2..

dogs. in fact, most of the available studies published on
this topic have been performed in two other species: rats
and cats. the central pressor response elicited by the
administration of cholinoceptor agents žacetylcholine,
cholinesterase inhibitors, cholinoceptor agonists. is known
to involve muscarinic cholinoceptors, since this pressor
response is blocked by atropine pretreatment žbrezenoff
and giuliano, 1982; buccafusco, 1996.. previous reports
from our laboratory have confirmed that a pretreatment
with the non-selective muscarinic cholinoceptor antagonist
atropine also abolishes such acetylcholine-induced cardiovascular responses in the dog žbrefel et al., 1995.. how-

ever, the subtypes of muscarinic cholinoceptors involved
in this central cholinergic pressor response remains a
matter of controversy according to the literature. for example, it has been suggested that the muscarinic m 1
cholinoceptor subtype plays a role in the regulation of
cardiovascular responses in spontaneous hypertensive rats
žwei et al., 1995.. it has also been reported that the
muscarinic m 2 cholinoceptor subtype is involved in the
cardiovascular responses elicited by a cholinergic stimula¨
tion in normotensive rats žozkutlu
et al., 1993; lazartigues
.
et al., 1998a,b as well as in cats žally et al., 1995.. martin
ž1992. reported that the muscarinic m 3 cholinoceptor sub-

m. pelat et al.r european journal of pharmacology 379 (1999) 117–124

type might also be involved in the cholinergic central
pressor response observed in the rat. to our best knowledge, there has been no study identifying the subtype of
muscarinic cholinoceptors involved in the central cardiovascular effects of acetylcholine in the dog.
the present results demonstrate as expected from previous experiments žrascol et al., 1990; brefel et al., 1995.
that i.c. administration of acetylcholine ž30 mg kgy1 .
evokes a significant increase in both blood pressure and
noradrenaline and vasopressin plasma levels. these effects
are mediated through the stimulation of central muscarinic
cholinoceptors, since a central pretreatment with the non‘‘selective’’ muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine ž1 mg
kgy1 . completely blocks them. to our best knowledge,
there are no studies in dogs assessing the effect of the i.c.
administration of either  xxxd2965xxx , methoctramine or pf-hhsid on such effects.  xxxd2965xxx  is widely used as a
selective antagonist for the muscarinic m 1 cholinoceptors
žp a 2 s 8.3. žmartin, 1992;  xxxd1704xxx  and watson, 1996..
binding studies have demonstrated that methoctramine is a
‘‘selective’’ muscarinic m 2 cholinoceptor blocker žp a 2 s
7.9. and that p-f-hhsid is a ‘‘selective’’ antagonist for
the muscarinic m 3 cholinoceptors žp a 2 s 7.9. žeglen et
al., 1990; martin, 1992;  xxxd1704xxx  and watson, 1996..
we assessed the ability of each antagonist to block in a
dose-dependent way the acetylcholine-induced pressor response. the id50 values were 0.5 mg kgy1 , 0.45 mg kgy1 ,
8.5 mg kgy1 , 43.5 mg kgy1 , respectively, for atropine,
 xxxd2965xxx , methoctramine and p-f-hhsid. moreover,
our results show that atropine ž1 mg kgy1 i.c..,  xxxd2965xxx 
ž1 mg kgy1 i.c.. and methoctramine ž20 mg kgy1 i.c..
completely abolished these pressor and hormonal effects.
the muscarinic m 3 cholinoceptor antagonist p-f-hhsid,
even at the dose of 50 mg kgy1 i.c., did not block
completely the acetylcholine-induced pressor response. so,
for this compound a higher dose was necessary to completely block this pressor effect.
in our study, and according to the id50 data, the order
of potency between each antagonist on this pressor response was atropines  xxxd2965xxx ) methoctramine4 pf-hhsid, suggesting that m 1 cholinoceptors are likely to
be involved in this pressor response.
to demonstrate that the dose of  xxxd2965xxx  used to
block this central cholinergic pressor effect remained selective for m 1 cholinoceptors, we checked that this dose
was insufficient to abolish two well-characterized cholinergic responses known to be induced by the stimulation of
m 2 and m 3 muscarinic cholinoceptor subtypes: many
higher doses of  xxxd2965xxx  ž40 to 50-fold higher than
atropine. were indeed necessary to block the peripheral
muscarinic m 2 receptor-induced bradycardia and the vasodilation induced by endothelial muscarinic m 3 receptors.
these findings confirm that the pressor response elicited
by the intracisternal injection of acetylcholine is mediated
through the activation of the muscarinic m 1 cholinoceptor
subtype in anesthetized beagle–harrier dogs.

123

this result is different from previous findings in other
experiments žxiao and brezenoff, 1988; martin, 1992;
ally et al., 1995.. this diversity of responses to central
cholinergic blockade is probably related to several factors,
including species specificity, drug selectivity, and the advancement of the pharmacology of the muscarinic
cholinoceptors. in the conscious cat, ally et al. ž1995.
clearly demonstrated that intracerebroventricular ži.c.v..
physostigmine ža cholinesterase inhibitor. elicited a dosedependent pressor response which was blocked by methoctramine, a muscarinic m 2 cholinoceptor antagonist.
brezenoff et al. ž1988. reported in the rat that i.c.v.
injection of the muscarinic m 1 cholinoceptor antagonist
 xxxd2965xxx  failed to prevent the pressor response to oxotremorine. moreover, the same authors reported that
blockade of central muscarinic m 3 cholinoceptors
žmuscarinic m 2 cholinoceptors according to the nomenclature in 1988. with 4-diphenylacetoxy-n-methyl-piperidine
methiodide ž4-damp. inhibited the pressor response induced by i.v. physostigmine in urethane-anesthetized normotensive rats. since 1992, 4-damp has been reclassified
as muscarinic m 1rm 3 cholinoceptor antagonist žmartin,
1992;  xxxd1704xxx  and watson, 1996.. it is likely that these
authors would have rather presently concluded to a muscarinic m 1 andror m 3 cholinoceptor participation in the
physostigmine pressor response, as suggested by martin
ž1992.. additionally, i.c.v. administration of 4-damp ž25
mg. was shown to reduce blood pressure in spontaneously
hypertensive rats žbrezenoff et al., 1988. moreover, a
participation of muscarinic m 1 cholinoceptor subtypes in
the genesis of arterial hypertension in spontaneous hypertensive rats has also been evoked by binding studies and
quantitative mrnas analysis žwei et al., 1995.. the pressor response induced by central or peripheral administration of cholinergic agonists has been shown to involve
caudal as well as more rostral brain areas žbrezenoff and
giuliano, 1982.. in agreement with this last assumption,
hori et al. ž1995. reported that intrahippocampal injection
of neostigmine, in normotensive rats, induced a pressor
response prevented by  xxxd2965xxx ; other brain areas, however, can be involved.
in our experiments, although the response obtained after
i.c. injection of muscarinic antagonists may represent the
contribution of receptors located in different rostral brain
areas, it is tempting to suggest that the cardiovascular
effects of acetylcholine injected by intracisternal route are
related to muscarinic mechanisms exerted at the level of
the lower brainstem andror the spinal cord. indeed, these
areas have been shown to contain several cholinergic
neurons as well as muscarinic receptors involved in the
blood pressure control žbuccafusco, 1996..
our data further showed that high doses of methoctramine ž20 mg kgy1 . induced an increase in systolic and
diastolic blood pressure. this pressor response can be
explained by a vasopressin release because we observed
simultaneously a significant increase in its plasma levels

žq22 pg mly1 .. one can wonder, however, if this vasopressin plasma levels increase was sufficient to produce a
vasoconstriction. in fact, rossi and schrier ž1986. reported
that 40 pg mly1 was necessary to induce a pressor response in dogs. another possibility could be that high
doses of the muscarinic m 2 cholinoceptor antagonist,
methoctramine, have been reported to block presynaptic
inhibitory autoreceptors, thus blocking the inhibition on
¨
acetylcholine release in the synaptic cleft žozkutlu
et al.,
1993..
in conclusion, this study demonstrates that in anesthetized dog, the central administration of acetylcholine
evokes an increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure
and in noradrenaline and vasopressin plasma levels. the
cardiovascular effects of acetylcholine, 30 mg kgy1 i.c.,
are mediated, in dogs, by the muscarinic m 1 cholinoceptor
subtype. it would be interesting to study the effect of
intracisternal injection of specific muscarinic m 1
cholinoceptor agonists like fks-508 or sb 202026 which
are presently proposed as potential antidementia agents in
patients with alzheimer’s disease.
