selectivity of widely used nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs
byron cryer, md, mark feldman, md
purpose: both isoforms of cyclo-oxygenase, cox-1 and
cox-2, are inhibited to varying degrees by all of the available
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids). because inhibition of cox-1 by nsaids is linked to gastrointestinal ulcer
formation, those drugs that selectively inhibit cox-2 may have
less gastrointestinal toxicity. we measured the extent to which
nsaids and other anti-inflammatory or analgesic drugs inhibit
cox-1 and cox-2 in humans.
subjects and methods: aliquots of whole blood from
16 healthy volunteers were incubated ex vivo with 25 antiinflammatory or analgesic drugs at six concentrations ranging
from 0 (control) to 100 mm (n 5 5 for each). blood was assayed
for serum-generated thromboxane b2 synthesis (cox-1 assay)
and for lipopolysaccharide-stimulated  xxxd1903xxx  synthesis (cox-2 assay). in addition, gastric biopsies from the same
volunteers were incubated with each drug ex vivo and mucosal
 xxxd1903xxx  synthesis measured.

results: inhibitory potency and selectivity of nsaids for
cox-1 and cox-2 activity in blood varied greatly. some
nsaids (eg,  xxxd2141xxx ,  xxxd2423xxx ) were cox-1 selective,
some (eg, ibuprofen, naproxen) were essentially nonselective,
while others (eg, diclofenac,  xxxd2556xxx  acid) were cox-2 selective. inhibitory effects of nsaids on gastric  xxxd1903xxx 
synthesis correlated with cox-1 inhibitory potency in blood (p
,0.001) and with cox-1 selectivity (p ,0.01), but not with
cox-2 inhibitory potency. even cox-2 “selective” nsaids
still had sufficient cox-1 activity to cause potent inhibitory
effects on gastric  xxxd1903xxx  synthesis at concentrations
achieved in vivo.
conclusion: no currently marketed nsaid, even those
that are cox-2 selective, spare gastric cox activity at therapeutic concentrations. thus, all nsaids should be used cautiously
until safer agents are developed. am j med. 1998;104:

most tissues throughout the body, including the gastrointestinal mucosa. cox-2 is expressed at low levels in
most cells, including the normal human stomach and intestine (10,11). unlike cox-1, however, expression of
cox-2 can be up-regulated at inflammatory sites by cytokines and bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide. thus, a nsaid that inhibits cox-2 while sparing
cox-1 has the potential to be anti-inflammatory yet
nontoxic to the gastrointestinal tract.
although currently available nsaids inhibit both
cox-1 and cox-2, many appear to inhibit one isoform
to a greater extent than the other (12–19). most data on
functional differences in cox isoform inhibition (selectivity) of nsaids have come from studies in animals or in
isolated cells. no studies have compared the effects of
various nsaids on the human gastrointestinal mucosa.
in this study, we investigated the cox-selectivity of
several nsaids in healthy men and women. first, we
measured the effects of the drugs in whole blood, using
assays that specifically detect cox-1 or cox-2 inhibition. second, we studied the effects of the same drugs in
the stomach by measuring ex vivo rates of prostaglandin
synthesis in human gastric mucosal biopsies exposed to
these agents. finally, we compared inhibitory effects of
the drugs on cox-1 and cox-2 in blood with their ability to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in the stomach.

onsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)
inhibit cyclooxygenase (cox), the rate-limiting
enzyme for synthesis of prostaglandins. although inhibition of cox may underlie the beneficial
anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects of
nsaids, simultaneous cox inhibition in the gastrointestinal mucosa often results in gastric and intestinal ulcers, which may have serious consequences. indeed, all
cox-inhibiting nsaids currently available by prescription in the united states carry a warning about lifethreatening gastrointestinal ulcers.
the recent discovery that there are two cox isoforms,
cox-1 and cox-2, that are variably expressed in different tissues raised the possibility that the therapeutic effect
of nsaids could be separated from their toxic gastrointestinal effects (1–9). cox-1 is expressed constitutively in

we studied 25 anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and other
drugs of interest (table 1). most were nsaids, including
6-methoxy napthalene acetic acid (6-mna), the active
metabolite of  xxxd2688xxx . ( xxxd3259xxx  sulfide, the active
metabolite of  xxxd3259xxx  was not available.) other drugs
included four nonacetylated salicylates, the corticosteroid dexamethasone, acetaminophen, and two experimental anti-inflammatory agents (ns-398 and  xxxd2727xxx ). we purchased from the manufacturer powdered
formulations of 22 of the drugs, specifically ibuprofen,
ketorolac, 6-methoxy napthalene acetic acid,  xxxd2727xxx ,
ns-398, and valeryl salicylate (from cayman chemical
co., ann arbor, michigan); and  xxxd234xxx  (aspirin), acetaminophen, dexamethasone, diclofenac,

for each drug, stock solutions were made by mixing
powdered drug with  xxxd1896xxx  (sigma chemical

drug (100, 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01 and 0 mm) were prepared by
mixing the appropriate amount of stock solution either
with 10 mm phosphate buffer saline (sigma chemical

materials and methods
prior to enrollment of study subjects, this study was approved by the human studies subcommittee of the dallas department of veterans affairs medical center.
we enrolled 16 nonsmoking healthy volunteers (6 men
and 10 nonpregnant women) between the ages of 23 and
46 years. none had a history of peptic ulcer, gastrointestinal surgery (except for appendectomy), nsaid use in
the past 2 weeks, chronic upper gastrointestinal symptoms, or use of histamine h2-receptor antagonists,  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors, misoprostol, or  xxxd3252xxx . each
subject was seronegative for helicobacter pylori infection
(flexsure hp; smithkline diagnostics, inc. san jose, california). subjects were scheduled for visits on study days 1
and 10. at both visits, health and medication histories
were confirmed, venous blood was obtained for cox-1
and cox-2 whole blood assays, after which each subject
underwent endoscopy with mucosal biopsy. during the

cox-1 whole blood assay. the measurement of thromboxane b2 synthesis from platelets following blood coagulation is a specific test for cox-1 activity (18,19). platelets constitutively express cox-1. in response to endogenous thrombin formation (ie, clot formation) platelet
cox-1 is maximally stimulated to produce thromboxane
a2, which is converted to thromboxane b2. thromboxane b2 production reaches a plateau 1 hour after coagulation.
on each study day, siliconized glass tubes were organized into four sets of six tubes so that each subject’s
blood sample would be exposed to the same four drugs as
his or her gastric mucosal biopsies. after venipuncture,
4-ml aliquots of whole blood were immediately transferred to tubes preloaded with freshly made study drug
solution so that final drug concentrations in each set of 6
tubes were 100, 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, and 0 mm. all tubes were
briefly and gently vortexed to distribute drug thoroughly

and then allowed to clot, initially for 45 minutes at 378c
and then for 2 additional hours at room temperature. at
the end of the 2-hour 45-minute incubation period, indomethacin was added to the tube at a final concentration of 30 mm, to terminate thromboxane b2 synthesis.
this was followed by centrifugation at 2,000g for 10 minutes at room temperature. one ml serum from each tube
was then stored at 2708c until thromboxane b2 was measured by radioimmunoassay, as previously described
(18). mean (6 sd) baseline thromboxane b2 synthesis in
whole blood at 2 hours 45 minutes was 236.0 6 105.4
ng/ml.

curvature of the gastric body. each gastric mucosal biopsy
was immediately placed in a study drug incubation solution.

cox-2 whole blood assay. the measurement of  xxxd1903xxx  production from monocytes and macrophages in whole blood following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide is a specific test for cox-2 activity. twenty-four hours after incubation of whole blood with
lipopolysaccharide, 95% to 99% of cox activity is
cox-2 (18,19). thus,  xxxd1903xxx  measured 24
hours after lipopolysaccharide stimulation should almost
exclusively reflect cox-2 activity.
first, 1.5 ml polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes
(fisher scientific, pittsburgh, pennsylvania) were preloaded with the same drugs and concentrations used for
that subject’s cox-1 and gastric mucosal assays. next,
whole blood was collected by venipuncture into heparinized vacuum tubes, pooled, and aliquoted into 24,
500-ml samples so that the same final six drug concentrations would be achieved as with the other assays. lipopolysaccharide (50 mg e coli serotype (127:b8; sigma
chemical co., st. louis, missouri) was added to each
tube, briefly vortexed, and then incubated for 24 hours at
378c for induction of cox-2. tubes were then centrifuged at 12,000g for 5 minutes, and 100 ml of the resulting plasma was mixed with 400 ml of methanol for extraction of prostaglandins and precipitation of proteins. supernatants were then stored at 2708c until they were
assayed for  xxxd1903xxx  by radioimmunoassay using
a kit ( xxxd1903xxx  [i125], biotrak radioimmunoassay
system; amersham life sciences, arlington heights, illinois). mean (6 sd) lipopolysaccharide-stimulated  xxxd1903xxx  synthesis in whole blood at 24 hours was
127.8 6 105.5 ng/ml.

gastric mucosal  xxxd1903xxx  ex vivo synthesis
assay. the ability of the gastric mucosa to generate prostaglandins (prostaglandin synthesis rate) estimates total
gastric cox activity (cox-1 plus any cox-2). to measure ex vivo prostaglandin synthesis rates, gastric mucosal biopsies were immediately placed in 1.5 ml polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes (fisher scientific, pittsburgh, pennsylvania) that contained 1 ml study drug
incubation solution. the 24 biopsies from each endoscopic session were allocated to four different drugs at six
concentrations per drug as directed by a previously determined drug allocation schedule. this schedule was designed so that gastric mucosal prostaglandin synthesis
was assessed five times for each of the six concentrations
of every drug, and so that each time a drug concentration
was tested (n 5 5), the incubated gastric mucosal biopsy
would be from a different study subject.
ex vivo gastric mucosal prostaglandin synthesis was
performed by a modification of a method previously described by our laboratory (20). briefly, incubation tubes
containing biopsies were weighed, and mucosal biopsy
weight was determined after subtraction of the original
tube weight. each mucosal biopsy was then finely minced
with scissors for 15 seconds, allowed to incubate after
mincing for 3 minutes, and then briefly centrifuged at
14,000g for 15 seconds to pellet tissue. since endoscopic
biopsies were placed in solution at varying times, original
incubation solutions were then discarded by aspiration
and replaced with 1 ml identical fresh solutions at timed
intervals. next, biopsies were briskly vortexed for 3 minutes (to generate and liberate prostaglandins). after 15
seconds of centrifugation, indomethacin (1025 m) was
added to the supernatant to stop further prostaglandin
synthesis. supernatants were then stored at 2708c until
ready for measurement of  xxxd1903xxx  by radioimmunoassay (21). prostaglandin synthesis is expressed as
nanograms of  xxxd1903xxx  synthesized per gramminute of tissue incubation. mean (6 sd) gastric mucosal  xxxd1903xxx  synthesis at baseline was 190.2 6
318.7 ng/g-min.

endoscopy and gastric mucosal biopsy. each subject,
after an overnight fast, received topical pharyngeal anesthesia with tetracaine hydrochloride (pontocaine;
winthrop pharmaceuticals, new york, new york), followed by light sedation with intravenous midazolam
(versed; roche laboratories, nutley, new jersey). using
an olympus endoscope (olympus corporation, new
york, new york), the gastroduodenal mucosa was visually inspected. no subject had any gastroduodenal erosion or ulcer at either endoscopy. following mucosal inspection, 24 mucosal biopsies were taken from the greater

calculation of drug ic50. for each study drug, a doseresponse curve was constructed by plotting the six drug
concentrations (x axis, logarithmic scale) against mean
percent inhibition for each group of five subjects (y axis)
of thromboxane b2 (for blood cox-1 assay), lipopolysaccharide-induced  xxxd1903xxx  (for blood cox-2
assay), or gastric  xxxd1903xxx  (for gastric mucosal
cox assay). next, the concentration of study drug that
inhibited mean cox activity by 50% (ic50) was calculated by computer-assisted extrapolation. specifically, a
computer-generated curve of concentration versus mean

percent inhibition (for each group of five subjects) was
constructed for each drug. using the formula for the
slope of the line between the two drug doses that bracketed (above and below) 50% inhibition, the ic50 was calculated. for some study drugs, cox activity was inhibited by less than 50% at the maximal concentration tested
(100 mm). in such instances the ic50 is reported as greater
than 100 mm.

statistical analysis
to determine correlations between drug ic50s in whole
blood assays and gastric mucosal assays, spearman’s
rank-correlation coefficient and pearson’s coefficient of
correlation were used (22). p values less than 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.

two of the drugs ( xxxd3159xxx  and  xxxd3163xxx ) inhibited
cox-1 at the concentrations tested in this study.  xxxd2423xxx  had the lowest ic50 (0.11 mm) and was thus the
most potent cox-1 inhibitor in blood. the range in potency of cox-1 inhibition varied at least 1,000-fold
among the 25 drugs.
all 25 drugs tested also inhibited cox-2 activity in
blood (table 2), with potency varying approximately
4,000-fold. the nsaid, diclofenac, had the most potent
cox-2 inhibitory effect in blood (ic50 5 0.01 mm), even
more potent than dexamethasone. some nsaids (eg,
fenoprofen, naproxen,  xxxd2807xxx  and 6-mna, the active
metabolite of  xxxd2688xxx ) were less potent cox-2 inhibitors in blood than acetaminophen. aspirin and acetaminophen had similar effects on cox-2 in blood (table
2), contrasting with aspirin’s nearly 10-fold greater potency on cox-1 (table 2).

since the actual ic50 for cox-1 in blood was .100 mm, a value of
100 mm was used in the calculation of this ratio. therefore, these ratios
represent a maximum possible ratio of ic50 cox-2/ic50 cox-1 in

cox-1 ic50 close to 1.0 indicates nearly equal selectivity.
selectivity among the 25 drugs varied approximately
10,000-fold. a few nsaids were cox-2 selective in
blood, particularly diclofenac (ic50 ratio 5 0.05, indicating 20-fold selectivity for cox-2),  xxxd2556xxx  acid (12.5fold), and  xxxd2065xxx  (8.5-fold). the two experimental
nsaids,  xxxd2727xxx  (59-fold) and ns-398 (24-fold),
were particularly cox-2 selective. dexamethasone and
the experimental compound valeryl salicylate were the
most cox-2 selective agents tested.

cox effects in gastric mucosa. potency on gastric mucosal cox inhibition varied by at least 300-fold among
the 25 drugs (table 2). aspirin was the most potent gastric cox inhibitor. the four non-acetylated salicylates
(valeryl salicylate,  xxxd3159xxx ,  xxxd3163xxx , and
bismuth subsalicylate), acetaminophen, and dexamethasone had no measurable effects on cox activity in the
stomach. as shown in figure 1, the ic50 for gastric mucosal cox correlated significantly correlated with the
ic50 for cox-1 in blood (p ,0.001). as illustrated in

figure 2, the ic50 for gastric cox also correlated with the
degree of cox-1 selectivity in blood (p ,0.01). in contrast, the ic50 for gastric mucosal cox inhibition did not
correlate with the ic50 for cox-2 in blood (figure 3).

discussion
we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the
cox-1 versus cox-2 effects of nsaids in healthy volunteers. our results regarding cox-selectivity can be
compared with those of previous reports using nonhuman cells (14,16). we found that two agents, indomethacin and  xxxd2969xxx , that were quite cox-1 selective for
murine cox, were essentially nonselective for cox in
human blood (table 3). likewise, 6-mna was sevenfold
selective for murine cox-2, but only onefold to twofold
for human cox-2. using bovine endothelial cells
(cox-1) and murine macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (cox-2), mitchell et al (16) analyzed the
selectivity of five of the nsaids that we examined. they
found aspirin (166-fold), indomethacin (60-fold), and
ibuprofen (15-fold) to be quite cox-1 selective, while
these drugs were only twofold to threefold cox-1 selective in human blood (16). naproxen was cox nonselective in both mitchell’s study and in ours. diclofenac was
also nonselective in the previous study, while we found
diclofenac to be 20-fold cox-2 selective in human blood.
differences in cox selectivity among these various studies are probably related to species differences in the cox
proteins.
the healthy gastrointestinal mucosa in humans predominantly expresses cox-1, with very little cox-2 expression (10,11). gastrointestinal mucosal cox-1 is re418

sponsible for catalyzing the synthesis of mucosal-protective prostaglandins from their precursor, arachidonic
acid (4,6,21). nsaids that are specific or very highly selective inhibitors of cox-2 might have few gastrointestinal side effects because mucosal synthesis of prostaglandins would be preserved. of the currently available
nsaids that we examined, diclofenac was the most potent and the most selective inhibitor of cox-2 in whole
blood. even though diclofenac was 20 times more selective for cox-2 than for cox-1, this drug still had sufficient cox-1 inhibitory activity in the stomach to be a
potent inhibitor of gastric mucosal prostaglandin synthesis. dexamethasone, on the other hand, one tenth as potent as diclofenac as a cox-2 inhibitor, was 25 times
more selective than diclofenac for cox-2 inhibition in
blood. moreover, this corticosteroid had essentially no
gastric mucosal cox inhibition at concentrations up to
100 mm, perhaps explaining why corticosteroid medications given without nsaids are not a risk factor for gastroduodenal ulcers (23). the observation that a highly
selective and potent cox-2 inhibitor such as dexamethasone had no demonstrable effect on gastric cox supports previous observations (10,11) that there is very little
cox-2 activity within the human stomach. the correlation we found between cox-1 potency of nsaids in
blood and the gastric mucosa also reinforces the concept
that the healthy stomach mainly, if not exclusively, expresses cox-1.
in addition to the potency and selectivity of a drug for
cox-1 or cox-2, the administered dose is another important feature that must be taken into consideration
when assessing overall potential gastrointestinal mucosal
effects. to evaluate whether the drug concentrations used

in these experiments and the calculated ic50s were comparable with the usual serum concentrations seen with
therapeutic dosing, we compiled pharmacokinetic data
for nsaids from a review of the available literature (table 4) (24 –33). for every drug for which data could be
compared, their expected therapeutic serum concentrations was well above their ic50 for gastric cox inhibition.
for example, the peak concentration of diclofenac in
blood after a single oral dose is 6.1 mm, more than 25
times higher than the ic50 in gastric mucosa. although it
is not known to what extent, and for how long, gastric
cox must be blocked to increase the risk of ulcer formation, all of the nsaids that we studied appear capable of
producing gastrointestinal mucosal prostaglandin depletion at customary doses.
aspirin irreversibly acetylates cox at a serine moiety
near the active site of the enzyme (34 –36). in the systems
we tested, aspirin’s ability to acetylate cox allowed it to
be a modestly potent inhibitor of cox-1 in blood and the
most potent gastric cox inhibitor, while the nonacetylated salicylates had relatively few effects in either cox-1
system. these ex vivo comparisons of the effects of  xxxd3163xxx  ( xxxd3163xxx ) and aspirin in the human
stomach confirm our previous in vivo observations. in

humans administered these two drugs at doses that produced identical serum salicylate concentrations, aspirin
markedly reduced gastroduodenal mucosal prostaglandin content, while the effects of  xxxd3163xxx  were indistinguishable from placebo (37).
cox inhibition by aspirin via acetylation appears to
play less of a role in cox-2 inhibition than in cox-1
inhibition, since valeryl salicylate ( xxxd2876xxx  rather than
acetyl substitution) was a very potent and selective inhibitor of cox-2, while aspirin only modestly inhibited
cox-2 in blood. interestingly, aspirin acetylates active
serine sites in both cox-1 and cox-2 (34 –36). in the
case of cox-1, aspirin acetylation reduces cox activity
by preventing  xxxd208xxx  binding to the cox active
site (34,35). with cox-2, however, acetylation does not
block substrate binding (36).
two prodrug nsaids were evaluated in our study,  xxxd3259xxx  and  xxxd2688xxx . only after absorption are these
prodrugs converted to active metabolites that have antiinflammatory activity. shortly after absorption,  xxxd3259xxx 
is reversibly reduced to  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide, its active metabolite (31).  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide is systemically distributed and
inhibits cox throughout the body, including the stomach.  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide has been reported to be 500 times

more potent than  xxxd3259xxx  as a cox inhibitor (25); unfortunately,  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide was not available to us at the
time of the study. when  xxxd3259xxx  was introduced, it was
stated to have a low incidence of gastrointestinal side effects (38). with longer periods of clinical experience,
however, gastrointestinal complications with  xxxd3259xxx 
have been similar to those of other nsaids (39).
 xxxd2688xxx  is a prodrug that is converted to its active
metabolite 6-mna (32,33) after absorption. when
6-mna and  xxxd2688xxx  were compared in the current
study, they were equally potent as inhibitors of cox-1
and cox-2 in blood, and both were only minimally
cox-2 selective. this probably occurred because  xxxd2688xxx  is rapidly converted to 6-mna in blood (32).
however, this conversion may not occur in the gastric
mucosa, since 6-mna was 40 times more potent a gastric
cox inhibitor than  xxxd2688xxx . thus, the 6-mna metabolite of  xxxd2688xxx  may lead to gastrointestinal mucosal prostaglandin depletion and predispose to ulcer
formation. chronic  xxxd2688xxx  administration in humans is associated with gastrointestinal ulceration (24),
but the incidence may be somewhat lower than with
other nsaids (40).
because of the limitations that are inherent in the estimation of ic50s through extrapolation, relative ranking
of drugs’ cox effects may not be as precise as suggested
by our listings. for example, a minor change in the extrapolated estimates of cox-1 inhibitory ic50s for diclofenac and ketorolac could result in a switching of their
positions in the rank list. the cox effects of our study
drugs should be viewed as relative ranges of selectivity or
potency rather than absolute rankings. another limitation is that cox responses to nsaids in our ex vivo
biopsy specimens may differ from in vivo responses. finally, it is possible that cox isoform distribution or cox
responses to nsaids in healthy subjects may differ from
those in nonhealthy patients such as those with peptic
ulcer disease or other inflammatory conditions, or who
are taking other medications.
newer drugs that may be more cox-2 selective than
currently available drugs are in various stages of research
and development (41,42). such agents may prove to be
effective anti-inflammatory agents that spare the gastrointestinal tract from injury. however, as seen from the
comparisons in the current study, even a high degree of
cox-2 selectivity does not guarantee freedom from gastric cox inhibition. gastric mucosal cox inhibition is
affected by a combination of cox selectivity, cox potency, and drug pharmacokinetics. the ideal nsaid
should be prescribed in doses that are high enough to be
anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, or analgesic, but not so
high that they result in serum and gastrointestinal mucosal concentrations that substantially reduce gastrointestinal mucosal cox-1 activity and prostaglandin synthesis.
none of the currently marketed nsaids, even those that
420

are cox-2 selective, have these gastrointestinal-sparing
features. nsaids should, therefore, continue to be used
cautiously until safer agents are developed.
