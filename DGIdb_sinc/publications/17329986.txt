interethnic differences in drug response:
the contribution of genetic variability in b
adrenergic receptor and cytochrome p4502c9
m muszkat1
ethnic differences in drug response have been extensively
reported, and ethnicity has been suggested to be useful
clinically as a predictor of drug response. genetic
polymorphisms in the genes encoding b1 adrenergic
receptor (ar) and b2 ar, targets of b ar antagonists, and
in cytochrome p4502c9, the enzyme involved in warfarin
metabolism, have the potential to explain some of the
observed ethnic variability in drug response and to improve
clinical practice.

ethnicity and drug response

there is considerable variability in drug response among
individuals receiving similar doses of a drug. such variability
may result in lack of efficacy in some patients and overtreatment and toxicity in others. to optimize drug therapy
for the individual patient, the selection of a drug and its dose
is influenced by factors such as age, sex, concurrent diseases,
concomitant medications, and body size, as well as ethnicity.
in contrast to race, which encompasses shared origin,
ethnicity is a multidimensional classification that includes
shared origin, social background, culture, and environment,
some of which contribute to variability in drug response.1
although the underlying factors contributing to interethnic
differences in drug response have not been fully elucidated,
major differences in the frequency of genetic polymorphisms
among ethnic groups suggest that these may contribute to the
interethnic differences in drug response.
genetic factors may alter drug response by affecting the
sensitivity of the drug target and/or the disposition of a drug.
in this review, we will focus on genetic polymorphisms in b1
adrenergic receptors (ars) and in the cytochrome p4502c9
(cyp2c9) metabolizing enzyme and on their consequences
for the response to drugs commonly used in cardiovascular
medicine. other functionally important polymorphisms,

which may be relevant to drug response, are discussed
elsewhere.2,3
ethnicity and genetic variability

diversity in the human genome is common, and more
than seven million common (minor allele frequency45%)
single-nucleotide polymorphisms are reported. most of
the common single-nucleotide polymorphisms are observed
in most major populations, with interethnic differences in
allele frequencies.4
studies suggest that clusters of geographic ancestry can be
inferred from genetic markers. however, there is lack of
agreement on the relationship between racial self-identification, commonly used as a proxy for ancestry, and genetic
groupings.5,6 despite these considerations, the usage of
self-perception for ethnic identity (such as ‘‘white’’, ‘‘black’’,
‘‘asian’’) in studies on ethnic differences is common and has
yielded clinically significant observations.
b adrenergic receptor polymorphisms and response
to b blockers

numerous observations have indicated that black patients
with hypertension respond less to monotherapy with b
blockers compared with white patients.7,8 the decreased
sensitivity to b blockers may be the result of the lower plasma
renin activity and higher proportion of low renin hypertension in blacks.9 in addition, greater reduction in blood
pressure and in plasma renin release in response to
propranolol was observed in chinese, compared with white
americans.10
b1 adrenergic receptor

in the b1 ar gene, two common single-nucleotide polymorphisms, gly49ser and gly389arg, have been reported.2
the prevalence of the gly389arg polymorphism varies
markedly among ethnic groups (table 1).2

practice

in vitro studies suggest that both polymorphisms are
functionally important.2 in healthy subjects, the change in
plasma renin activity in response to dobutamine, a b1 ar
agonist, was higher in arg389 homozygotes compared with
gly389 carriers,11 and resting blood pressure response to
atenolol, a selective b1 blocker, was significantly greater in
arg389 homozygotes compared with gly389 homozygotes.12
in hypertensive patients treated with metoprolol, a two- to
threefold greater reduction in diastolic blood pressure in
arg389 homozygotes compared with gly389 carriers was
observed,13 and b1 ar diplotype regarding positions 49 and
389 was a significant predictor of blood pressure response to
metoprolol.13
studies on the relationship between b1 ar polymorphisms
and the response to b1 ar antagonists in congestive
heart failure are sparse, and have yielded conflicting results.
the b1 ar arg389gly polymorphism was not associated
with clinical outcomes or with heart rate reduction in
congestive heart failure patients treated with metoprolol,14 or
in patients treated with carvedilol or bisoprolol.15 however,
in other studies, arg389 homozygote patients had significantly greater improvement in left ventricular ejection
fraction on echocardiography compared with gly389 homozygotes after treatment with carvedilol16 and metoprolol,17
and a 38% reduction in mortality was observed among
arg389 homozygotes, whereas among gly389 carriers,
no clinical response was observed after treatment with
bucindolol.18
b2 adrenergic receptor

several studies have suggested that b2 ar polymorphism is
associated with the response to b blockers. three nonsynonymous polymorphisms have been identified in the
human b2 ar, at positions 16, 27, and 164. interethnic
differences in allelic distribution of the common position
27 and 16 polymorphisms have been reported (table 1).2
in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that all three polymorphisms are functionally important, affecting vasodilation,2,19

cardiac responses to agonist, and the desensitization of these

clinical data indicate that b2 ar polymorphism may be
associated with the response to b blockers in congestive heart
failure. a lower proportion of gln27 homozygous patients
showed improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction after
treatment with carvedilol, compared with glu27 carriers.21 in
a study of patients with acute coronary syndrome treated
with b blockers, mortality was associated with gln27 and
with arg16 homozygosity, both more common in blacks. the
relationship between b2 ar genotypes and mortality was not
observed in patients not treated with b blockers, suggesting
that b2 ar genotypes modulate response to b blockers, rather
than the progression of disease. interestingly, no association
with b1 ar polymorphisms was observed in this study.22
overall, these data suggest that the response to some b
blockers may be reduced in patients with gly389 and that b2
ar polymorphisms may contribute to the variability in
response to b blockers. the higher frequency of the lossof-function b1 ar gly389 in blacks compared with whites
may be a possible explanation for the reduced response to
b blockers in black americans; however, this has not yet been
shown directly. if this is confirmed in prospective studies, b1
ar gly389 genotype, rather than ethnicity, should be used to
predict response to b blockers. as important differences in
pharmacological properties exist between various b blockers,
and disease–gene interactions are possible, a knowledge of
the contribution of b ar genotypes to b blocker response
may translate into clinical practice in the future in one
of several ways, including the decision to prescribe any b
blocker, the selection of an agent, or the dose in which it is
administered.
genetic polymorphism in cyp2c9

the cyp2c9 isoform mediates the biotransformation of
about 10–15% of all drugs undergoing oxidative liver
metabolism, including most non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, oral anticoagulants, angiotensin receptor blockers, oral
hypoglycemics, phenytoin, and fluvastatin.3,23
in addition to the wild-type allele (cyp2c9*1), two
common variant alleles, cyp2c9*2 and cyp2c9*3, resulting
in amino-acid changes, have been identified.3 three additional, rare cyp2c9 variant alleles have been reported. there
is considerable interethnic variability in the distribution of
cyp2c9 allelic variants (table 2).3
in vitro studies have shown that although both alleles are
associated with reduced metabolism of cyp2c9 substrates,3,23 cyp2c9*3 is associated with a more pronounced
reduction in catalytic activity compared with cyp2c9*2 in
vitro,23 greater reduction of cyp2c9-mediated metabolism in
vivo,3,23,24 and slower metabolism of all cyp2c9 substrates
studied, compared with cyp2c9*2.23
cyp2c9 polymorphism contributes significantly to the
interindividual variability in warfarin dose requirement23–25
and is associated with increased international normalized
ratio (inr) and risk for bleeding complications.25 this has

been observed despite a lower warfarin dose requirement
among carriers of cyp2c9 variant alleles.25 in addition, the
risk for overanticoagulation during the first 2 weeks of
treatment with warfarin is higher among carriers of cyp2c9
variant alleles.26
it should be noted that the currently recognized cyp2c9
polymorphisms only partially explain the variability in
 xxxd990xxx  clearance (more than 15-fold variability among
wild-type homozygotes24) and do not explain the interethnic differences in warfarin dose requirement and
clearance. warfarin dose requirement was reported to be
lower in japanese compared with whites (figure 1).27 however, cyp2c9*2 is not reported in asian populations, and the
frequency of cyp2c9*3 is lower in asians than in whites.3,23
furthermore, despite the lower dose requirement in japanese
who are wild-type homozygous, warfarin clearance was
significantly higher compared with white patients.27 thus,
environmental and genetic factors, such as polymorphisms
in cyp2c9, or in yet-unknown genes that regulate its
expression, may contribute to the interethnic variability in
warfarin clearance.
the interethnic differences in warfarin effect are now
better understood. polymorphisms in the gene encoding
 xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductase ( xxxg2418xxx ) contributing to the
variability in warfarin dose requirement have been reported.28 asian americans28 and hong kong chinese
patients29 had a higher proportion of haplotype associated
with low warfarin dose compared with whites.
in addition to  xxxg2418xxx , polymorphisms in genes encoding glutamyl g-carboxylase,  xxxd3522xxx -dependent coagulation
factors and inhibitors, and microsomal epoxide hydrolase30
contribute to the variability in the warfarin effect (table 2).
the current practice of warfarin treatment is to administer a
‘‘standard’’ initial dose, with later doses individualized based
on measured inr values. the current understanding of
warfarin pharmacogenetics can translate into improved
clinical practice in at least one of two ways: by defining the
specific warfarin dose requirements for each patient (according to his/her combined genotype with regard to cyp2c9

and other genes), or by focusing on patient groups at the
highest risk for bleeding (such as cyp2c9*3/*3). this
remains to be shown definitively in prospective studies and
is the subject of a current food and drug administrationproposed investigation.
conclusions
applications of ethnic differences in drug response

interethnic differences in drug metabolism and response may
contribute to variability in response to some drugs. however,
ethnicity is a crude marker for drug response, as intraethnic
differences in drug metabolism and response may be larger
than overall interethnic differences.
the linking of interethnic differences in drug response
to differences in allele frequencies allows the generation of
hypotheses regarding the specific alleles responsible for
interindividual variability. the investigation of such hypotheses will yield information on the underlying mechanisms
of drug action and toxicity that will be applicable to all
populations that differ only in gene frequency.
the use of self-perception for ethnic identity in clinical
practice requires several considerations: although it is controversial if self-identification correlates with origins and genetic
factors, it reflects the multidimensional nature of the term
ethnicity and therefore represents a combination of variables
such as genetic factors, lifestyle, nutrition, and morbidity,
all of which contribute to interindividual variability in drug
response.
genetic-based prescribing: how far are we?

despite the increasing knowledge of functionally important
genetic polymorphisms, there are no interventional prospec217

practice

tive studies to show that genetic-based prescribing improves
drug safety or efficacy in clinical practice. in the field of
cardiovascular medicine, clinical data have accumulated to
suggest that genetic polymorphisms in b1- and b2 ar, and in
cyp2c9, as well as other genes, have the potential to improve
clinical practice. cyp2c9 polymorphism has the potential to
become clinically useful because of its high frequency and
its substantial effect on warfarin metabolism, and because
of warfarin’s narrow therapeutic index and the grave consequences of overdose and subclinical effect. however, it
remains to be seen whether genetic factors (both cyp2c9
and  xxxd3522xxx  related) will allow useful prediction of drug
requirement in practice and whether this will translate into
genetically based dose tailoring for each patient or focus on
patient populations with the highest risk for bleeding.
the knowledge of functionally important genetic polymorphisms relevant to drug metabolism and response is
increasing rapidly. this suggests that ethnicity cannot be
translated to clinical applications that reduce the observed
differences in drug response. prediction of drug response
will require prospective studies that will combine multigenic
approaches and environmental factors that will enable
translation of the knowledge of functionally important
genetic polymorphisms into clinical practice.
