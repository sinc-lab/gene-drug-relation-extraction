abstract
background and aims:  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase (gad, ec 4.1.1.15) catalyses the conversion of glutamate to
g- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba). the 65 kda isoform,  xxxg850xxx  is a potent autoantigen in type 1 diabetes, whereas
 xxxg849xxx  is not. a hybrid cdna was created by fusing a human cdna for amino acids 1 – 101 of  xxxg849xxx  to a human
cdna for amino acids 96–585 of  xxxg850xxx ; the recombinant (r) protein was expressed in yeast and was shown to have
equivalent immunoreactivity to mammalian brain gad with diabetes sera. we here report on enzymatic and
molecular properties of rgad67/65. methods: studies were performed on enzymatic activity of rgad67/65 by
production of 3h-gaba from 3h-glutamate, enzyme kinetics, binding to the enzyme cofactor  xxxd3047xxx 
(plp), stability according to differences in ph, temperature and duration of storage, and antigenic reactivity with
various gad-specific antisera. results: the properties of rgad67/65 were compared with published data for
mammalian brain gad (brackets). these included a specific enzyme activity of 22.7 (16.7) nkat, optimal ph for
enzymatic activity 7.4 (6.8), km of 1.3 (1.3) mm, efficient non-covalent binding to the cofactor plp, and high
autoantigenic potency. the stability of rgad67/65 was optimal over 3 months at − 80 °c, or in lyophilized form
at −20 °c. conclusions: hybrid rgad67/65 has enzymatic and other properties similar to those of the mixed
isoforms of gad in preparations from mammalian brain as described elsewhere, in addition to its previously
described similar immunoreactivity. © 2002 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

dominantly in brain and pancreatic b-islet cells
(erlander et al., 1991). the identification of the
gene for feline gad (benson et al., 1989) was
followed by recognition of two functionally different isoforms,  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx , that diverge in
sequence particularly in the first 100 n-terminal
residues, are hydrophobic ( xxxg850xxx ) or hydrophilic ( xxxg849xxx ), and are located in cell membranes ( xxxg850xxx ) or in the cytosol ( xxxg849xxx ) (bu
et al., 1992). serum autoantibodies to gad, particularly  xxxg850xxx , were identified in 1988 by solimena and colleagues by western immunoblot
(solimena et al., 1988) in the rare neurological
disease stiff-man syndrome which can be associated with diabetes, and subsequently in spontaneously occurring type 1 diabetes mellitus
(baekkeskov, 1986). this led to an upsurge of
interest in gad. native brain gad (rowley et
al., 1992), and subsequently recombinant forms of
 xxxg850xxx  prepared in various expression systems,
escherichia coli (hao and schmit, 1993), yeast
(powell et al., 1996; law et al., 1998; papakonstantinou et al., 2000; hampe et al., 2001), baculovirus (mauch et al., 1993), and rabbit
reticulocyte lysate (rowley et al., 1996), were
developed for use in diagnostic assays (zimmet et
al., 1993; tuomi et al., 1993), and also for use as
tolerogenic ‘vaccines’ to assess prevention of diabetes in non-obese diabetic (nod) mice (petersen
et al., 1994; pleau et al., 1995) preparatory to use
in humans (schernthaner, 1995). however, the
preparation of highly purified recombinant
 xxxg850xxx  is difficult, as the n-terminal region of
 xxxg850xxx  is very hydrophobic. to overcome this
we designed a hybrid construct in which the nterminal hydrophobic region  xxxg850xxx  (amino
acids 1–96) is replaced by the more hydrophilic
counterpart of the  xxxg849xxx  (amino acids 1– 101,
teoh et al., 1998). this molecule can be readily
expressed from yeast strains saccharomyces cere6isiae and pichia pastoris (law et al., 1998; papakonstantinou et al., 2000), and purified by
affinity chromatography. the resulting  xxxg849xxx /
65 hybrid was shown to react similarly to mammalian brain gad by immunoprecipitation using
sera from patients with type 1 diabetes (law et
al., 1998). in this report, we assessed the biochemical properties of the recombinant  xxxg849xxx /65,

and compared the results with published data
from preparations of brain gad containing
mixed isoforms of  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx .

2. materials and methods

2.1. expression and purification of rgad67 /65 in
saccharomyces cere6isiae
human gene constructs were used to encode
rgad67/65 which was expressed from s. cere6isiae strain yrd-15 (mata ura3 his3 leu2 ) from
the vector pmonbc6 as described previously
(law et al., 1998). the phosphoglycerate kinase
promoter ( xxxg1736xxx  ) was used to drive a high-level
constitutive expression of protein, in growth media containing 10% glucose, 1% yeast extract, 20
mg ml − 1 uracil, 20 mg ml − 1 histidine, 0.12%
(nh4)2so4, 0.1% kh2po4, 0.07% mgcl2, 0.05%
nacl, 0.01% cacl2 and 0.005% fecl3. rgad67/
65 was prepared by affinity purification on a
gad-1 monoclonal antibody column (law et al.,
1998). rgad67/65 was stored in 30% (w/v) glycerol at − 20 °c unless otherwise noted.
the yeast cells were lysed by vortexing the cells
with equal volumes of glass beads (425–600 mm
diameter) and lysis buffer (50 mm kh2po4, 1
mm edta, 1 mm aminoethylisothiouronium
bromide (aet), 20 mm  xxxd3047xxx 
(plp), 10 mm  xxxd26xxx  ( xxxd26xxx ), 0.5
mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pmsf) and
10 mm glutamate, ph 7.2); and the rgad65/67
was purified from clarified lysate by affinity chromatography using the monoclonal antibody
 xxxg849xxx , as described previously (law et al., 1998).
all buffers contained 1 mm aet, 20 mm plp,
and 10 mm glutamate to maintain enzyme activity unless otherwise stated.

2.2. measurement of rgad67 /65 enzyme acti6ity
the procedure for measuring rgad67/65 enzymatic activity was based on that described previously (rowley et al., 1992; law et al., 1998;
papakonstantinou et al., 2000). the enzyme was
incubated with the substrate 10 mm l-glutamate
containing 100 000 cpm of 3h-glutamate in 50

j.c. tong et al. / journal of biotechnology 97 (2002) 183–190

mm kh2po4, 1 mm  xxxd26xxx , 1 mm pmsf, 0.2
mm plp, and 1 mm aet in a final volume of
130 ml. the ph of the final reaction mixture was
7.2. the standard incubation was performed for
30 min at 37 °c. activity was quantified using a
spin column chromatography procedure that uses
the anion exchange resin  xxxg2361xxx -x8 (bio-rad, hercules, ca) to separate 3h-gaba from the more
highly acidic substrate 3h-glutamate. reactions
were stopped after 30 min with 20 ml of 0.25 m
h2so4. control reactions were stopped with 20 ml
of 0.25 m h2so4 prior to the addition of l-glutamate. all reactions were performed in duplicate
with tests and controls included for each run.

2.3. effect of 6ariation in ph, inorganic
phosphate concentration, substrate concentration
and time on enzyme acti6ity
the effect of ph on enzyme activity was tested
over a range of ph 4– 12 by adding 10 m
kh2po4, or 10 m khpo4 to the total reaction
mix as appropriate. the final ph was determined
using universalindikator ph sticks with ph
ranges from ph 0 to 14, 4.0 to 7.0, 6.5 to 10.0
(merck, darmstadt, germany) immediately prior
to the 30 min incubation at 37 °c. the effects of
changes in concentration of inorganic phosphate
were assessed at a range of concentrations from
0.1 to 1.0 m. various glutamate concentrations
from 0 to 20 mm were assessed by addition of
unlabelled l-glutamate, with all assays containing
100 000 cpm of 3h-glutamate. the time-course in
the reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 ml
of 0.25 m h2so4 after incubation at 37 °c for 0,
30, 60 and 120 min.

2.4. preparation of plp-free rgad67 /65
although gad is a plp-dependent decarboxylase,  xxxg849xxx  binds plp more strongly than does
 xxxg850xxx  (martin et al., 2000). we observed that
rgad67/65 prepared by the standard procedure
from yeast lysate was enzymatically active even
when tested using a reaction buffer that lacked
plp (unpublished data). to study the requirement of rgad67/65 for plp, we prepared plpfree gad using a yeast lysate that had been

185

dialyzed against plp-free lysis buffer, and
purified using buffers that lacked plp. the enzyme activity of this gad preparation was then
tested before and after the addition of plp in the
reaction buffer.

2.5. enzyme stability of rgad67 /65 at different
temperatures
the effect of temperature on the retention of
enzyme activity of rgad67/65 was measured using a single preparation that had been separated
into aliquots and stored at − 80, − 20, 4, 22 and
37 °c for 2, 4, 20, 72 h, 7, 15 days, 1, 2, 3 or 4
months, and on lyophilized rgad67/65 stored at
− 20 °c for up to 3 months. all preparations
were routinely stored in 30% glycerol at −20 °c,
except for the aliquots stored at − 80 °c and
lyophilized samples.

3. results
rgad67/65 was purified by affinity chromatography from the cell lysate of recombinant s.
cere6isiae and the yield is about 400 mg l − 1 of cell
culture. the specific enzyme activity is between
15.2 and 30.2 nk at and the protein concentration
is about 100 mg ml − 1 depending on the
preparations.

3.1. effects of 6ariation in ph, phosphate
concentration, substrate concentration and time on
enzyme acti6ity
the effects of changing ph on the activity of
the enzyme were examined over a ph range of
4–12. in each of three separate experiments, enzyme activity was greatest at ph 7.4, and was
lowest at ph 5 and below and at ph 10 and above
(fig. 1a). this loss was not related to changes in
the phosphate concentration, after adjustment of
the ph with either 10 m kh2po4, or 10 m
khpo4, since the enzyme activity increased with
increasing concentrations of inorganic phosphate
at a constant ph of 6.8, the normal ph of the
reaction (fig. 1b). there was a linear increase in
activity of rgad67/65 with increasing substrate

j.c. tong et al. / journal of biotechnology 97 (2002) 183–190

186

linear increase in the amount of 3h-gaba produced with increasing time over a 2 h period at
37 °c (data not shown).

3.2. effects of plp on enzyme acti6ity
standard preparations of rgad67/65 from
yeast lysates were enzymatically active even when
tested using a reaction buffer that lacked plp.
accordingly, to examine whether plp was essential for enzyme activity, gad was prepared from
a yeast lysate that had been derived using a
plp-free lysis buffer. the ensuing plp-free gad
preparation had no detectable enzyme activity.
enzyme activity was restored by the addition of
plp to the reaction mixture (table 1).

time

there was a constant or apparent increase in
activity over 1 month when stored in 30% glycerol
at − 20 °c and a slow decrease in activity thereafter (table 2b). lyophilized rgad67/65 retained
76% of the initial specific enzyme activity over a 3
month period compared with 42% for rgad67/65
stored in 30% glycerol at − 20 °c (table 2c).

4. discussion
the construction of various recombinant
molecular forms of  xxxg850xxx  has simplified the
large-scale expression and purification of this
molecule. our rgad67/65 construct has advantages by reason of removal of the highly hydrophobic n-terminal sequence of 100 residues which
adheres tightly to membranes (christgau et al.,
1992; solimena et al., 1993, 1994; shi et al., 1994),
whilst the major functional domain of the protein,
and capacity to react with specific antibodies are
retained (teoh et al., 1998). however, detailed
enzymatic studies on recombinant forms of gad
are lacking. here we show that rgad67/65 has
enzymatic properties mostly comparable with
those reported for gad prepared from human
brain (blindermann et al., 1978); the optimal ph
of rgad67/65 is slightly higher (7.4 vs. 6.8) and
the km for glutamate is identical (1.3 mm).
we observed that the enzyme activity of gad
was stimulated by increasing the concentration of
inorganic phosphate, in accord with porter and
martin (1988) who showed that while atp acts as
a strong competitive inhibitor of activation of
gad, inorganic phosphate may stimulate its activation at low concentrations (1– 5 mm) but inhibit it at higher concentrations. however, in
contrast to their finding that higher concentrations of phosphate were inhibitory, we found
increases in enzyme activity at inorganic phosphate concentrations up to 1 m. it has been
suggested that due to the stabilization of an intermediate complex from inactive apogad (gad
without plp cofactor bound) to active hologad
(gad with bound plp cofactor) by a low inorganic phosphate concentration through ionic interactions, and that a high concentration of
inorganic phosphate can compete with the phosphate groups of plp for the binding site on the
enzyme (chen et al., 1998). in other words, the
intermediate complex provides a favorable
configuration for the formation of a schiff base,
whereby the o-amino group of the lysine at the
active site reacts with the aldehyde group of plp,
so leading to a large conformational change by
the enzyme, and a resulting increase in stability
(chen et al., 1998). our results suggest that free

phosphate in solution at concentrations up to 1 m
is insufficiently competitive at blocking the binding site on the enzyme for the phosphate groups
of the co-factor plp.
in order to investigate whether the binding of
plp is affected by substituting the first 100 amino
acids of  xxxg850xxx  with  xxxg849xxx , we studied the
binding characteristics of plp to recombinant
 xxxg849xxx /65. studies of gad cofactor interactions
by kaufman and colleagues (kaufman et al.,
1991) showed that, in mouse brain extracts, almost all of the  xxxg849xxx  component, which is
distributed throughout neurons, is saturated with
plp and thus present in an active holoenzyme
form whereas only about half of the  xxxg850xxx ,
which is concentrated mainly in axon terminals,
exists as active holoenzyme and half is present as
inactive apoenzyme. hence apogad65 may act
as a gad reservoir in the synaptic terminals and
be available for regulation by atp and inorganic
phosphate through their ability to influence
strongly the association of plp to gad, with
association rates decreased by atp and increased
by inorganic phosphate (martin, 1987; kaufman
et al., 1991). our experimental data suggest that
yeast-expressed rgad67/65 has plp binding
characteristics that are similar to those of
 xxxg850xxx , in that the addition of plp increases
enzyme activity, presumably by converting apoenzyme to holoenzyme.
only limited studies on the stability of gad
have been performed; data on enzyme stability at
temperatures below 0 °c are even lacking until
now. studies of enzymatic activities for a number
of rat brain enzymes showed that gad was one
of the least stable enzymes among the several
studied, including  xxxg440xxx , glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase,  xxxg913xxx , lactate dehydrogenase and 2%,3%-cyclic
nucleotide phosphohydrolase (ritchie et al.,
1986). we found that when recombinant gad
was stored at 4 °c, the enzyme activity declined
to 58% of the control value by 72 h, and when
stored at 22 °c, activity declined to 33% of the
control value by 72 h. these results are similar to
those for gad from rat brain in which enzyme
activity declined to 65% of the control value at
4 °c for 72 h, and to 29% of the control value at

j.c. tong et al. / journal of biotechnology 97 (2002) 183–190

25 °c for 72 h (ritchie et al., 1986). when kept at
− 20 °c, recombinant  xxxg849xxx /65 activity was
stable for 35 days after which it began to decline
to 72% of the control value by 4 months. at
− 80 °c, rgad67/65 retained its activity for at
least 4 months. recombinant  xxxg849xxx /65 was
more stable at −20 °c when lyophilized than
when kept in glycerol. after 3 months at −
20 °c, activity of lyophilized rgad67/65 declined to 76% of control compared with 42%
when kept in 30% glycerol. accordingly we recommend storage of recombinant gad at −
80 °c without glycerol. where this is not
possible, we recommend lyophilized storage of the
enzyme at −20 °c.
in conclusion, we have demonstrated that, first,
yeast rgad67/65 is comparable with human
brain gad as an enzyme; second, rgad67/65 is
activated in the presence of concentrations of
inorganic phosphate of at least up to 1 m; third,
the plp interaction with rgad67/65 is similar to
that of  xxxg850xxx ; and fourth, rgad67/65 is stable
over a period of 4 months at −80 °c with no
detectable loss of activity. these data should be
useful for studies that involve comparison of different preparations or types of recombinant gad
in future research or therapeutic applications.
