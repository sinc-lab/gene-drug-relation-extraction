abstract
recently, a novel intestinal bacterial metabolite of ginseng
protopanaxadiol saponins, i.e., 20-o-(b-d-glucopyranosyl)20(s)-protopanaxadiol (ih-901), has been reported to induce
apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells. here we show a
differential effect of ih-901 on several cell types. exposure to
ih-901 for 48 hours at a supposedly subapoptotic concentration of 40 amol/l led to both apoptotic cell death and g1
arrest in hep3b cells, but only resulted in g1 arrest in mdamb-231, hs578t, and mkn28 cells. additionally, the treatment
of mda-mb-231, but not of hep3b, with ih-901 up-regulated
 xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) mrna (2 hours) and protein
(6 hours), and enhanced the production of  xxxd1903xxx .
in mda-mb-231 cells, ih-901 induced the sustained activation
of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk), whereas
inhibition of mitogen-activated protein/erk kinase
blocked ih-901-mediated cox-2 induction and resulted in
apoptosis, suggesting the involvement of an erk-cox-2
pathway. combined treatment with ih-901 and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibited cox-2 enzyme and
induced apoptosis in mda-mb-231 and hs578t cells.
adenovirus-mediated cox-2 small interfering rnas also
effectively inhibited cox-2 protein expression and enhanced ih-901–mediated apoptosis without inhibiting
erk 1/2 phosphorylation, thus providing direct evidence that cox-2 is an antiapoptotic molecule. moreover,
ih-901–mediated g1 arrest resulted from an increase in
 xxxg419xxx  mrna and protein expression followed by a decrease
in  xxxg410xxx  kinase activity that was concurrent with the
hypophosphorylation of rb and  xxxg1937xxx . in conclusion, ih-901
induced both g1 arrest and apoptosis, and this apoptosis
could be inhibited by cox-2 induction. (cancer res 2005; 65(5):

introduction
 xxxd2200xxx  c.a. meyer is an herbal root that has been used
for more than 2000 years throughout far eastern countries
including china, japan, and korea. its beneficial effects have been
analyzed by extensive preclinical and epidemiological studies (1–3).
recently, 20-o-(h-d-glucopyranosyl)-20(s)-protopanaxadiol (ih901), a novel ginseng saponin metabolite, formed from ginsenosides rb1, rb2, and rc was isolated and purified after giving

 xxxd2200xxx  p.o. to humans and rats (4). ih-901 has been shown
to enhance the efficacy of anticancer drugs in cancer cell lines
previously resistant to several anticancer drugs (5, 6), to exhibit
antigenotoxic and anticlastogenic activity in rats concurrently
treated with benzo(a)pyrene (7), and to induce apoptosis (8, 9).
these studies found that the antitumor activity of ih-901 is
attributable to the induction of apoptosis.
recently, the link between cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 and cancer
has been studied (10, 11). cox catalyzes the conversion of
 xxxd208xxx  to prostaglandins and related eicosanoids. two
isoforms of cox, which are the products of distinct genes, have
been identified. cox-2 is an inducible and immediate-early gene
that is up-regulated in many epithelial malignancies (12–15).
unlike constitutively expressed cox-1, cox-2 overexpression is
associated with neoplastic transformation (12), cell growth (16),
angiogenesis (17), invasiveness, and metastasis (18). although
in vivo, the exact mechanism has not been clearly elucidated,
in vitro studies have shown in a variety of cell types that cox-2
overexpression is antiapoptotic (19). this antiapoptotic effect is
associated with inhibition of fas (20) and up-regulation of bcl-2
(21). even though cox-2 is an important target for cancer
therapy, cox-2 is induced by several anticancer agents such as
paclitaxel (22),  xxxd2655xxx  (23), and radiation (24), suggesting
its association with drug resistance.
physiologically,  xxxg419xxx  seems to be important for blocking
progression of cells from late g1 into s via its interaction with
cyclin e- xxxg410xxx  complexes (25).  xxxg419xxx  has been also implicated as
a mediator of the growth arrest due to its regulation by protein
kinase a activating agents (26). ih-901 stimulated  xxxg419xxx  induction
and subsequent cell cycle (g1) arrest.
in this study, we discovered that ih-901, a novel ginseng
metabolite, could inhibit human cancer cell proliferation by
inducing cell cycle arrest as well as apoptosis. treatment with
ih-901 resulted in cell cycle (g1) arrest by  xxxg419xxx  induction.
additionally, we provide evidence here that cox-2 functions as
an antiapoptotic molecule as its inhibition by both nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaid) and adenoviral-cox-2 small
interfering rnas (sirna) significantly enhanced ih-901-mediated
apoptosis. these findings provide a molecular basis for the
antineoplastic effects of ih-901 and use of this ginseng
metabolite may aid in enhancing the anticancer drug efficacy
by cox-2 inhibition.

(san diego, ca); and bcl-2 antibodies from dako (denmark).
cell cultures. mda-mb-231, hep3b, and mkn28 cells were grown in
rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and
gentamicin (10 ag/ml). hs578t cell line was grown in dmem supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and gentamicin. subconfluent
monolayers of cells were utilized in all experiments.
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide assay.
cell viability was determined by measuring the absorbance of 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (sigma) dye for living
cells, as described earlier (9). ic50’s were calculated based on the survival rate of
untreated cells being 100%.
cell cycle analysis. apoptosis was monitored by measuring hypodiploid dna content (sub-g1). cells (5  105) were seeded in 60 mm dishes
and allowed to attach overnight. cell cultures were then incubated with
ih-901 at 40 amol/l concentration for the indicated times. fluorescenceactivated cell sorting analysis using  xxxd3027xxx  (pi) was done as
described previously (27). the relative dna content per cell was obtained
by measuring the fluorescence of dna bound  xxxd3027xxx . cell
cycle analysis was conducted using a facstar flow cytometer (becton
dickinson, san jose, ca) and a modfit lt v2.0 computer program.
chromosomal dna isolation and ladder formation assay. cells
were harvested and then suspended in a lysis buffer [50 mmol tris-cl
(ph 8.0), 10 mmol edta, and 0.5% laurylsarcosine] containing 50 ag/ml
 xxxg1963xxx . chromosomal dna was isolated and ladder formation assays
were done as described previously (9).
rna extraction, northern blot analysis, and mrna stability assay.
total rna preparation and northern blotting were done as described
previously (28). blots were hybridized with radiolabeled probes for cox-2
cdna (kindly provided by dr. stephan m. prescott, university of utah) and
a  xxxg419xxx  cdna fragment for rna expression. for mrna stability assay, the
relative band intensities of p27  xxxg419xxx  and h-actin mrna at each time point
were quantified by determining radioactivity using a fuji fla2000 and
image analysis software (image gauge, version 3.12).
western blot analysis. cells were washed with ice-cold pbs and
suspended in lysis buffer [20 mmol tris-cl (ph 7.4), 100 mmol nacl, 1%
np40, 0.5% sodium  xxxd1835xxx , 5 mmol mgcl2, 0.1 mmol phenyl-

methylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mmol pepstatin a, 0.1 mmol antipain,
0.1 mmol chymostatin, 0.2 mmol leupeptin, 10 ag/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mg/ml
soybean  xxxd207xxx , and 1 mmol  xxxd302xxx ] on ice for 30
minutes. lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 20
minutes. equal amounts of cell extracts (100 ag) were resolved by sdspage, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with
appropriate primary and horseradish-conjugated secondary antibodies,
as described previously (29). anti-a-tubulin antibody (sigma) was used as
a loading control. detection was done using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (amersham pharmacia biotech, buckinghamshire,
united kingdom).
 xxxd1903xxx  production and determination of cox-2 activity.
cells were treated with ih-901 and/or celecoxib, a specific cox-2 inhibitor,
for 24 hours in complete growth medium containing 10% fetal bovine
serum. afterwards, culture medium was collected to determine the amount
of  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) secreted by the cells. for the measurement of
cox-2 enzymatic activity, pge2 quantification was measured using a pge2
enzyme immunoassay kit (cayman) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, as described previously (30). results are expressed as
picograms of pge2 per 106 cell f sd.
immunoprecipitation and kinase assays.  xxxg410xxx  and cyclin
e-associated h1 histone kinase activity were determined as described
previously (27). two hundred micrograms of cell extracts were used per
immunoprecipitation with  xxxg410xxx  antibody coupled to protein a or g
beads. after being washed,  xxxg410xxx  kinase assays on histone h1 was done
by incubating the immune complex beads with 30 al of kinase reaction
[0.25 al (2.5 ag) of histone h1, 0.5 al (5 aci) of g-[32p]atp, 0.5 al of 0.1
mmol atp and 28.75 al of kinase buffer] for 30 minutes at 37jc. the
reaction was stopped by boiling the samples in 2 sds sample buffer for
5 minutes. samples were analyzed by 12% sds-page, and the gels were
then dried and subjected to autoradiography. preimmune serum was also
analyzed for possible nonspecific immunoprecipitation in these studies.

cell cycle phase were determined based on dna content in (a ) with viable nonapoptotic cells (z2 n dna contents). d, the levels of antiapoptotic bcl-2 and
proapoptotic bax proteins were analyzed in hep3b cells after the treatment with ih-901 for the indicated times.

sirnas against cox-2 were controlled for sequence specificity by blast
searching and did not show homology to other known human genes,
especially cox-1. spei-ecori digested psuper containing u1 promoter–
directed knockdown constructs were subcloned into pshuttle vector of
adeno-x expression system (clontech, palo alto, ca), thereby replacing
the cytomegalovirus-promoter sequence. the sequences of the inserts
and their orientations were examined by dna sequencing analyses.
sirna expression cassettes for cox-2 or gfp from recombinant pshuttle
plasmid dna were digested and ligated to adeno-x viral dna according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. these adenoviral vectors were
infected and amplified in hek293 cells. cscl-purified virus was dialyzed
against ca2+- and mg2+-free dpbs containing 10% glycerol. the virus titer
was determined using a standard plaque assay. viral stock was aliquoted
into appropriate volumes and stored at 70jc until use.
adenovirus infection in vitro. recombinant adenoviruses expressing
cox-2 or gfp sirnas were used on the target cells at a multiplicity of

cox-2 inhibits ih-901–mediated apoptosis

figure 3. ih-901 induced cox-2 in mda-mb-231, mkn28, and hs578t cells but not in hep3b cells. a, mda-mb-231 cells were harvested after being incubated with
the indicated concentrations of ih-901 for 24 hours. equal amounts of cell extracts (100 ag/lane) were resolved by 10% sds-page and analyzed by western
blotting with an antibody specific for cox-2. b, treatment of mda-mb-231 cells with 40 amol/l ih-901 induced cox-2 expression of mrna and protein in a
time-dependent manner but vehicle (ethanol) did not. fifteen micrograms of total rna were used for northern analysis. anti-a-tubulin was used as a protein
loading control. c, mda-mb-231 cells were treated with varying concentrations of ih-901 and/or celecoxib for 24 hours. conditioned media were collected and
analyzed by elisa for pge2. results are expressed as the mean of six separate experiments done in duplicate. columns, mean; bars, sd; n = 6. *, p < 0.01 compared
with untreated cells. ih-901 increased pge2 production in a dose-dependent manner, and celecoxib effectively reduced ih-901-mediated pge2 production.
d, mda-mb-231, hs578t, mkn28, and hep3b cells were treated with 40 amol/l ih-901 for 24 hours. western analyses were done with antibodies specific to
cox-2 or a-tubulin.

(8, 9). in order to examine the mechanism of growth suppression by
ih-901, cancer cells were treated with 40 amol/l ih-901 for 48 hours
and then analyzed for cell cycle progression by flow cytometry. the
apoptotic sub-g1 fraction increased to 31.74% in hep3b cells after
treatment with ih-901 for 48 hours, whereas those of mda-mb-231
and mkn28 cells were 5.23% and 2.76%, respectively, indicating that
ih-901 induced a significant apoptotic cell death in hep3b but not in
mda-mb-231 and mkn28 cells (fig. 2a). the increase in the sub-g1
fraction and endonucleolytic dna cleavage in hep3b cells by ih-901
was evident in a time-dependent manner (fig. 2b). as shown in fig.
2c, ih-901-induced cell cycle arrest at the g0-g1 phase and a
progressive decline of s phase cells occurred in mda-mb-231 as well
as in hep3b cells. these results suggest that ih-901 induced
apoptotic cell death concurrent with cell cycle arrest in hep3b cells,
whereas it caused g0-g1 arrest only in mda-mb-231 and mkn28
cells. as ih-901-mediated apoptosis is reported to be associated with
the activation of caspase-3 and parp cleavage (8, 9), levels of
antiapoptotic bcl-2 and proapoptotic bax proteins were analyzed in
hep3b cells. bcl-2 expression decreased in a time-dependent
manner but bax expression did not change (fig. 2d). hs578t breast
cancer cell lines also showed only g0-g1 arrest after treatment with
40 amol/l ih-901 (data not shown).

cox-2 induction by treatment with ih-901. because several
recent reports have implicated the role of cox-2 in preventing
apoptosis in various cell types (19–23), we examined the ability of
ih-901 to induce cox-2 in mda-mb-231 cells. as shown in fig.
3a, 40 amol/l of ih-901 treatment resulted in the induction of
cox-2 protein in mda-mb-231 cells. cox-2 protein and mrna
were induced in a time-dependent manner by 40 amol/l ih-901;
the ethanol vehicle had no effect on cox-2 induction (fig. 3b).
pge2 production was also increased by ih-901 treatment in a
dose-dependent manner, consistent with the induction of cox-2
protein (fig. 3c). ih-901 also induced cox-2 protein in mkn28
and hs578t cells but did not lead to cox-2 induction in hep3b
cells (fig. 3d). mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) pathways mediate the regulation of cox-2 expression when induced
by a variety of extracellular stimuli (32, 33). to determine whether
ih-901 activates mapk pathways in mda-mb-231 cells, the levels
of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk),
p38mapk, and c-jun-nh2-kinase proteins were evaluated by
western analysis. western blots of mda-mb-231 cell extracts
were probed with antibodies selective for the phosphorylated
(activated) forms of  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx . as shown in fig. 4a, ih901 induced a time-dependent increase in phosphorylated  xxxg1369xxx

and  xxxg1366xxx  with levels elevated up to 24 hours. marginal ethanolinduced erk activation was also observed but this was very weak
compared with ih-901-induced erk activation (data not shown).
to determine whether the activation of  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx  is
required for ih-901-mediated cox-2 induction, mda-mb-231 cells
were pretreated with uo126, a selective inhibitor of map/erk
kinase 1/2. uo126 (10 amol/l) strongly inhibited ih-901-induced
cox-2 expression for up to 12 hours (>fig. 4a). although blocking
 xxxg1369xxx /2 with 10 amol/l uo126, the cell cycle distribution of
mda-mb-231 cells was analyzed by flow cytometry (fig. 4b).
cotreatment with ih-901 and uo126 caused the percentage of
apoptotic sub-g1 population to increase from 5% to 18%,
compared with ih-901 treatment alone, suggesting that map/
erk kinase inhibition can enhance ih-901-mediated apoptosis in
mad-mb-231 cells. no significant change in the phosphorylated
forms of c-jun-nh2-kinase and p38mapk was observed until 4
hours of ih-901 treatment (fig. 4c).
inhibition of cox-2 enhances ih-901–mediated apoptosis.
celecoxib inhibited ih-901-induced production of pge2 in a
dose-dependent way in mda-mb-231 cells (fig. 3c). to address
whether cox-2 protein induced by ih-901 plays an important
role in protecting cells from ih-901-mediated apoptosis, we
examined the effects of cox-2 inhibition on ih-901-mediated
apoptosis using the selective cox-2 inhibitors, celecoxib, or
ns-398 (fig. 5a). briefly, mda-mb-231 cells were treated with
celecoxib (25 or 100 amol/l) or ns-398 (100 or 500 amol/l) for
30 minutes before adding 40 amol/l ih-901. cell cycle analysis
showed that although celecoxib and ns-398 alone had no
significant effect on the apoptotic fraction, pretreatment with
celecoxib (25 amol/l) followed by ih-901 enhanced the
apoptotic sub-g1 fraction from 5% to 40%. similarly, ns-398
(500 amol/l) pretreatment followed by addition of ih-901
increased the apoptotic fraction up to 30%. the combined
treatment of a cox-2 inhibitor (25 amol/l celecoxib or
200 amol/l ns398) with 40 amol/l ih-901 increased the
apoptotic sub-g1 fraction in hs578t cells. these results strongly
suggest that cox-2 enzyme activity protects mda-mb-231 and
hs578t cells from ih-901-induced apoptosis. we analyzed the
expression of bcl-2 and bax in the absence or presence of ns398 (250 amol/l) on 40 amol/l ih-901 in mda-mb-231 cells.
bcl-2 expression decreased in the presence of ns398 up to
24 hours, whereas bax expression did not change (fig. 5b).
therefore, the inhibition of cox-2 in ih-901-treated mda-mb231 cells changes the effect of ih-901 on the level of bcl-2. to
more specifically test the requirement for cox-2 induction in the
antiapoptotic mechanism, we down-regulated the expression
level of cox-2 protein by using the sirna technique in mdamb-231 cells. the target sequences of sirna used were specific
for the cox-2 gene but not the cox-1 gene. we applied
adenovirus-mediated delivery of sirnas strategy to specifically
reduce the expression of the cox-2 gene. the adenoviral vectors
expressing sirnas effectively reduced cox-2 gene expression,
compared with parental and gfp-sirna expressing cells, without
interrupting erk 1/2 phosphorylation following treatment with
ih-901 (fig. 5c). cox-2 knockdown resulted in a dramatic
increase in the apoptotic sub-g1 fraction after ih-901 treatment,
compared with mock-infected and gfp knockdown (fig. 5d).
these results show that the cox-2 signaling pathway is critical
in blocking ih-901-mediated apoptosis and that cox-2 plays an
important role as an antiapoptotic molecule.

figure 4. ih-901 induced a time-dependent increase in phosphorylated
 xxxg1369xxx /2 in mda-mb-231 cells. equal amounts of cell extracts (100 ag/lane)
were resolved by 10% sds-page and analyzed by western analysis with
antibodies specific to  xxxg1369xxx /2 or to the phosphorylated forms of  xxxg1369xxx /2. cox-2
induction was significantly inhibited by map/erk kinase 1/2 inhibitor (uo126)
in mda-mb-231 cells. a, to determine whether mapk activation is required
for ih-901-induced increases in cox-2 protein levels, cells were treated with
a selective map/erk kinase inhibitor (uo126) 1 hour before 40 amol/l ih-901
or vehicle addition and then incubated for 24 hours. uo126 (10 amol/l)
significantly inhibited cox-2 induction by ih-901. b, mda-mb-231 cells were
preincubated with 10 amol/l uo126 for 60 minutes. afterwards, the addition
of ih-901 increased the apoptotic sub-g1 fraction, whereas uo126 treatment
alone showed no toxic effect on mda-mb-231 cells. the percentage of sub-g1
cells was determined based on their dna content histograms. representative
data from three independent experiments. c, mda-mb-231 cells were treated
with ethanol vehicle and ih-901 for the indicated times and western analyses
of the activated form and total p38 and c-jun-nh2-kinase expression were
done. phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx  13-acetate was used for the induction of
c-jun-nh2-kinase activation.

induction of  xxxg419xxx  by ih-901 leads to the inhibition of
 xxxg410xxx  kinase activity. because ih-901 arrested the cell cycle at the
g0-g1 phase in mda-mb-231 and hep3b cells (fig. 2c), we
investigated whether ih-901 affects the expressions of g1-specific
cell cycle regulatory molecules in mda-mb-231 cells expressing
mutant p53 protein (ref. 34; fig. 6a). we examined the protein
expression profile of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors associated
with g1 arrest. western blot analysis showed that ih-901 treatment

of mda-mb-231 cells strongly induced the protein levels of

p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  did not change for up to 24 hours.  xxxg421xxx  was
not detected in mda-mb-231 or hs578t cell lines, both of which
are homozygously deleted for the  xxxg421xxx  gene (35). the  xxxg419xxx 
expression on ih-901 treatment of two cell lines, hs578t and
mkn28, showed similar pattern as in mda-mb-231 (data not
shown). because the  xxxg419xxx  level was up-regulated in mda-mb-231
cells by 40 amol/l ih-901 within 24 hours, we investigated the
effect of ih-901 on the kinase activity of  xxxg410xxx  associated with
cyclin e. as shown in fig. 6b, treatment of mda-mb-231 cells with
ih-901 strongly decreased the histone h1-associated kinase
activities of  xxxg410xxx . the protein levels of  xxxg366xxx  and cyclin e

phosphorylation status of the prb-related proteins prb/ xxxg1936xxx  and
 xxxg1937xxx / xxxg1937xxx . the treatment of mda-mb-231 cells with 40 amol/l ih901 increased the levels of hypophosphorylated forms of prb and
 xxxg1937xxx  in a time-dependent manner (fig. 6c). snu-16 is a control cell

of  xxxg419xxx  protein levels by ih-901 resulted from the elevation of
p27  xxxg419xxx  mrna expression (fig. 6d, top). we analyzed p27  xxxg419xxx  mrna
degradation in the absence and presence of ih-901 by northern
analysis, in  xxxd1800xxx  d-treated mda-mb-231 cells (fig. 6d,

the transcriptional level. the levels of  xxxg419xxx  were also increased in
hep3b following treatment with ih-901 (fig. 6a), as observed in
mda-mb-231 cells. these results indicate that in hep3b cells ih-901
can simultaneously induce  xxxg419xxx -mediated g1 arrest as well as
apoptotic cell death without cox-2 induction.

discussion
ginseng saponins exert various important pharmacologic
effects with regard to the control of many diseases including
cancer. the present study focuses on identifying the mechanism
that underlies the antitumor activity of ginseng saponins. the
study shows, for the first time, that ih-901, a novel ginseng
saponin metabolite, can cause simultaneous growth arrest and
apoptosis. additionally, adenoviral infection of cox-2 sirnas
provides direct evidence that cox-2 protein can function as an
antiapoptotic molecule.
ih-901 could induce the expression of cox-2 protein via erk
signaling. the suppression of ih-901-induced cox-2 expression by
the map/erk kinase inhibitor uo126 suggests that the erk
signaling pathway is important in the regulation of cox-2 by ih901. knockdown of cox-2 expression by sirnas did not block erk
activation in mda-mb-231 cells. ih-901 treatment led to the
activation of erk (data not shown) but failed to induce cox-2 in
hep3b cells. therefore, ih-901-induced erk activation is required
but not sufficient for inhibition of apoptosis.

several anticancer drugs have been shown to induce cox-2
expression (22, 23). for example, microtubule- or actininterfering agents stimulate mapk signaling and activator
protein activity, enhance pge2 synthesis, and increase levels of
cox-2 mrna and protein (22).  xxxd2006xxx  was
found to up-regulate cox-2 expression and pge2 production in
association with the activation of both the erk and protein
tyrosine phosphatase signaling pathways (36). the suppression of
apoptosis by cox-2 is thought to favor carcinogenesis by
permitting the survival of cells that have acquired mutations,
and is viewed as one of the main mechanisms of tumorigenesis.
as cox-2 induction by anticancer drugs may result in unwanted
effects such as inflammation, the combined use of selective
cox-2 inhibitors and conventional anticancer drugs has been
suggested (23).
however, the interpretation of previous nsaid studies was
complicated by possible cox-independent mechanisms. in many
cases, nsaids alone induced apoptosis at much higher
concentrations than their ic50’s. cox-2 mutant proteins lacking
cox activity have been reported to inhibit cell cycle progression
in a variety of cell types (37). in order to confirm that cox-2
protein is an antiapoptotic molecule, we constructed adenoviral
cox-2 sirnas for selective targeting of the cox-2 protein itself
rather than opting to use nsaids to inhibit cox-2 enzymatic
activity. our data shows that both nsaid treatment and
knock-down of the cox-2 gene by sirnas could cause apoptosis

cox-2 inhibits ih-901–mediated apoptosis

in mda-mb-231 cells, providing direct evidence that cox-2
protein plays an important role in suppressing ih-901-mediated
apoptosis.
thus far, the antitumor activity of ih-901 has been attributed
solely to apoptosis (8, 9). however, in this study, we show a second
mechanism: cell cycle arrest. ih-901 strongly induced  xxxg419xxx  and
inhibited  xxxg410xxx  activities followed by an increase in hypophosphorylated levels of prb and  xxxg1937xxx . these molecular effects of ih901, especially the up-regulation of  xxxg419xxx , may play important
roles in the g1 arrest seen in mda-mb-231, mkn28, hs578t, and
hep3b cells. the observed up-regulation of  xxxg419xxx  by ih-901 and
resulting decrease of  xxxg410xxx  kinase activity is important and
consistent with an earlier report that decreased  xxxg419xxx  expression
in breast carcinomas are associated with aggressive phenotypes
and that adenoviral infection with human  xxxg419xxx  resulted in cell
cycle arrest (38). the prb-related proteins,  xxxg1936xxx  and  xxxg1937xxx ,
cooperate to regulate cell cycle progression at g1-s checkpoint. it
has been reported that  xxxg1937xxx  and  xxxg419xxx  are mutually involved in
the negative regulation of cellular proliferation (39). ih-901 reduced
 xxxg410xxx -cyclin e kinase activity, and increased the hypophosphorylated levels of rb-related proteins. hep3b is known to be rbnegative (40) and has mutant p53 (41). even though hep3b cells
showed marginal g1 arrest, the progressive decline of the s phase
was indicative of g1 arrest (fig. 2c). however, it is difficult to
exclude the possibility of the involvement of p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  in ih901-mediated growth arrest because all four cell lines used in this
study express mutant p53. we found the induction of p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx

mrna and protein in a carcinoma cell line containing wild-type
p53 after the treatment with ih-901 (data not shown). collectively,
the growth inhibitory effects of ih-901 in cells could be caused by
the following progression: induction of  xxxg419xxx  leads to a decrease
in kinase activity of cdks followed by modulation of further
downstream targets such as prb-related proteins and the e2f
family of transcription factors family.
in summary, the findings of this study show that ih-901, a novel
ginseng saponin metabolite, induces apoptosis and inhibits cell
proliferation by g1 arrest via increase of  xxxg419xxx  expression. cox-2
induction caused by ih-901 could diminish the antitumor effects,
and strongly suggests the therapeutic use of cox-2 sirnas to
inhibit cox-2. further study will contribute to the development
of ih-901 or ginseng-related drugs as potential chemotherapeutic
or chemopreventive agents.
