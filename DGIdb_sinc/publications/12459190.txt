abstract
the phthalate ester insensitive blue-green algae (synechococcus lividus) were used as a food source to extend the survival of
synchronously hatched brine shrimp (artemia salina) larvae allowing measurement of a reduced toxic response to phthalate esters at
late post-hatching stages of development. the maximum acute toxicity due to di-n-butyl phthalate (dnbp) correlated with the
expression of a phthalate ester-hydrolyzing enzyme. the puriﬁed enzyme was identiﬁed as a  xxxg248xxx  due to its rapid
inactivation by low concentrations (107 m) of diisopropyl ﬂuorophosphate and inhibition by physostigmine (ic50 ¼ 6  107 m)
and tetraisopropylpyrophosphoramide (i-ompa, ic50 ¼ 5  106 m) but not by bw284c5. apparently competition of the
phthalates with the endogenous substrates of the enzyme led to development-dependent toxicity.

identiﬁcation of biochemical processes mediating
acute toxic responses is an important goal in molecular
toxicology. the brine shrimp (artemia salina) has been
employed in screening for bioactive compounds from
natural sources, even though the biochemical mechanisms underlying acute toxicity have not been examined
in detail [1]. acute toxicity is easily measured, as synchronously hatched cultures are readily available. the
larvae are viable for 36–48 h, after which they require
food for survival. our purpose was to extend the survivability of artemia embryos so that toxicity studies
could be performed at later stages of development
and facilitate identiﬁcation and characterization of the
biochemical target of phthalate ester toxicity.
phthalate esters, which are commonly used as plasticizers, are well-established environmental contaminants
[2,3]. their bioaccumulation, teratogenicity, and reproductive eﬀects in marine invertebrates resulted in studies
of their environmental distribution, fate, and mechanisms

of action [4–6]. in studies with artemia larvae we showed
that maximal accumulation of dnbp within the larvae
occurred prior to the development of the early acute toxic
response, which was, in turn, correlated with the expression of a dnbp-hydrolyzing enzyme (dnbpase) [7,8]. in
this paper we report the reduced early stage-dependent
embryotoxicity in artemia, extended from 48 to 96 h posthatching using the phthalate ester insensitive blue-green
algae synechococcus lividus as a food source. the
concomitant induction of toxicity with the expression of
dnbpase, here identiﬁed as a  xxxg248xxx ,
suggests that the enzyme is a mediator of the acute toxic
response. these observations implicate the characterized
 xxxg248xxx  in a critical but still incompletely
deﬁned role in artemia development.

and acute toxicity determinations for artemia in the presence and
absence of various quantities of s. lividus were conducted as previously
described [7,8].
puriﬁcation of dnbpase and its characterization as a  xxxg248xxx . free swimming larvae 24 h post-hatching were collected as
described elsewhere [9] and homogenized in 50 mm tris, 0.2 mm
edta, and 0.1 mm dtt at ph 7.5. the supernatant remaining after
centrifugation at 150,000g for 90 min was treated with ammonium
sulfate to bring the concentration to 50% (w/w) and stored at 20°
overnight. the crude enzyme that precipitated was collected by centrifugation  xxxd1891xxx ,000g for 15 min at 4 °c dissolved in a minimum
amount of buﬀer and dialyzed overnight at 4 °c against several
changes of buﬀer. the dialyzed solution was passed through p-100.
column fractions containing [14 c]dnbp-hydrolyzing activity [7] were
pooled and chromatographed on deae bio-gel a using a 0–1.2 m
kcl gradient in buﬀer. peak fractions showing [14 c]dnbp-hydrolyzing activity were collected. protein was determined [10] and speciﬁc
activity was characterized as picomoles of [14 c]dnbp hydrolyzed/min/
mg protein. dnbpase activity was analyzed in the presence of physostigmine, bw284c51, iompa over a range of concentrations (104 –
107 m).
molecular weight of dnbpase. an apparent molecular weight of
the puriﬁed enzyme was determined by chromatographic mobility of
the puriﬁed enzyme on p-100 columns using aprotinin,  xxxg569xxx ,
chymotrypsin, ovalbumin, and bovine  xxxg124xxx  as standards.
buche probe. a pvui/ecori fragment containing a cdna for
human  xxxg248xxx  was excised from a puc18 vector (attc
65728) and ligated to the pvui/ecori fragment of pgem2 (promega).
riboprobe was synthesized using manufacturerõs protocol from a linearized recombinant plasmid as the template and digoxigenin-utp
(roche) as a label. the riboprobe was ethanol precipitated and collected by centrifugation. the pelleted rna was washed twice with
70% (v/v) ice-cold ethanol and redissolved in buﬀer.
northern blot analysis. total rna and poly(a)þ rna were isolated
using manufacturerõs protocol with rnazol (tel-tex) and hybond
paper (amersham), respectively. poly(a)þ rna was fractionated on
1.2% agarose gels [11] and capillary blotted onto nylon membranes
(magnagraph msi). the membranes were prehybridized for 3 h at 42 °c
in 50% (v/v) formamide, 1 m nacl, 1% (w/v) sds, 10% (v/v) dextran
sulfate, and 10 lg/ml salmon dna. digoxigenin-labeled probe was
added to the mixture and hybridized overnight at 42 °c. membranes
were washed twice (30 min each) in 2 ssc/0.1% sds at room temperature and twice in 0:1 ssc/0.1% sds at 65 °c. the membrane was
blocked in 2% (w/v) buﬀered casein (0.1 m tris and 0.15 m nacl, ph
7.5) for 2 h and then incubated with anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (roche) for 30 min at room temperature.
the membrane was washed twice in 0.1 m tris, 0.15 m nacl, and 0.05 m
mgcl2 , ph 9.6, containing 1 lg/ml amppd (tropix) for chemiluminescent detection of hybridization signals. the blot was exposed to x-ray
ﬁlm for 2 h and the ﬁlm was developed.

sensitive to the toxic eﬀects of phthalate esters [12]. fig. 1
shows a plot of reduced mortality observed at increasing
doses of s. lividus as the sole food source. survival was
dose-dependent and nearly complete survival of larvae
occurred at the highest algae doses for 120 h.
fig. 2 shows that onset of toxicity due to dnbp
diﬀered markedly depending on the time at which contact of the larvae with the ester was initiated. sensitivity
of the larvae to the ester remained highest when contact
was initiated 16–36 h post-hatching. this was the same
time period during which the expression of the dnbpase also occurred [7]. indeed, the enzyme increased to
near maximal activity 16–20 h post-hatching and leveled
oﬀ between 36 and 45 h post-hatching. during the same
time period the appearance of a signal to a digoxigeninlabeled riboprobe was generated against buche using a
template derived from a human  xxxg248xxx 
cdna. here, we have isolated and further puriﬁed this
enzyme. after ammonium sulfate precipitation of the
enzyme from a crude supernatant obtained from 24 h
post-hatching larvae and subsequent chromatography
on g-75 followed by deae biogel a, dnbp-hydrolyzing activity eluted as a single peak. the enzyme was
completely inactivated at low concentrations of diisopropyl ﬂuorophosphate (107 m, dfp), suggesting it to
be a serine esterase. the molecular weight of dnbpase
was calculated to be 52  5 kda by molecular exclusion
chromatography on g-75. the extent of puriﬁcation
was improved by at least a factor of 10 over that previously reported [8].
support for classifying dnbpase as a  xxxg248xxx  was obtained from inhibitor studies [15].
physostigmine (scheme 1, i) and tetraisopropylpyrophosphoramide (i-ompa, scheme 1, iii) were inhibitors with ic50 ¼ 6  107 and 5  106 m, respectively.

results
past 48 h post-hatching development, the spontaneous
mortality of unfed, synchronously developing larvae was
signiﬁcant, making it impossible to evaluate the eﬀects of
toxic agents. newly hatched nauplius larvae could survive at least 110–120 h post-hatching when they were fed
with a variety of organisms such as yeast [13] and algae
[12,14]. in earlier experiments we examined a number of
algae that could be conveniently cultured and employed
to control mortality in artemia. the cultured blue-green
algae s. lividus were useful here since the algae are in-

critical to both dnbp-induced acute toxicity and to an
undeﬁned biochemical event in development. a delay in
the onset of dnbp-toxicity just preceding the expression of the enzyme and the diminished dnbp-toxicity
later in development when the enzyme has reached
maximum levels were consistent with a role for the enzyme during early development.
the function of buches in development has not been
well deﬁned. buche may be important in cell–cell
communication [16], in cell-adhesion, and in neuronal
morphogenesis [17]. the observation of a buche in
artemia was not surprising: such enzymes characterize
the early phase of neurogenesis, a process known to
begin early post-hatching in artemia larvae. in vertebrate neurogenesis the appearance of buche precedes a
burst in acche synthesis; the latter being associated
with synaptogenesis [18–20]. buche has been suggested
to be important in neural tube formation and neurite
growth, processes that are inhibited by acch [21]. expression or ampliﬁcation of cholinesterase genes may
also play a role in cell proliferation and diﬀerentiation
[22–24].
in summary, we have characterized a phthalate esterhydrolyzing enzyme in the early post-hatching developmental program in artemia as a  xxxg248xxx 
where it may play a role in early neurogenesis. this
enzyme appears to be the critical target of the environmental pollutant phthalate ester plasticizer, dnbp. if
all microcrustaceans are as sensitive in the early developing phase as are the brine shrimp artemia, then the
ecology of our seas and coastal areas may be markedly
aﬀected. further, the continuous presence of phthalates
in higher organisms needs to be explicitly evaluated with
respect to potential neural tube developmental defects
associated with  xxxg248xxx  inhibition.

however, bw284c51 (scheme 1, ii), which was a
speciﬁc inhibitor of acetylcholinesterases that has little
eﬀect on butyrylcholinesterases, was not an inhibitor of
dnbpase. finally, a digoxigenin-labeled riboprobe
was generated against buche using a template derived
from a human  xxxg248xxx  cdna. poly(a)þ
rna was isolated from post-hatching larvae and analyzed by northern blotting using the digoxigenin-labeled probe. a single hybridization signal was
obtained. the appearance of the hybridization signal
and appearance of enzyme activity paralleled the expression of maximal toxicity (fig. 2).
