abstract

purpose:  xxxd330xxx  is a retinoic x receptor agonist that has been shown in vitro to inhibit
growth and induce differentiation of myeloid leukemic cell lines.we therefore conducted a phase
i dose escalation study to assess the maximum tolerated dose, toxicities, and activity of  xxxd330xxx  in patients with non-m3 acute myeloid leukemia (aml).
experimental design: we enrolled patients with active non-m3 aml who had either relapsed
or refractory disease or were not eligible for standard cytotoxic chemotherapy. cohorts of three to
six patients received escalating doses of daily oral  xxxd330xxx  ranging from 100 to 400 mg/m2
until evidence of disease progression or unacceptable adverse events occurred.
results: twenty-seven patients, with median age of 69 years (range, 51-82 years), were treated.
twenty-four (89%) patients had undergone prior chemotherapy. at the highest dose level tested
(400 mg/m2), three of six patients had to reduce their dose of  xxxd330xxx  due to grade 3 adverse
events. the maximum tolerable dose of  xxxd330xxx  was determined to be 300 mg/m2. clinical
activity was manifested by 4 (15%) patients with reduction in bone marrow blasts to v5%, 11
(41%) patients with improved platelet counts, and 7 (26%) patients with improved neutrophil
counts. three patients with relapsed aml survived >1 year while taking  xxxd330xxx . leukemic
blast differentiation was suggested by the presence of the leukemic cytogenetic abnormality in
mature circulating granulocytes and the occurrence of differentiation syndrome.
conclusions: the recommended dose of  xxxd330xxx  for future studies is 300 mg/m2/d.  xxxd330xxx  is well tolerated in patients with non-m3 aml and has evidence of antileukemic activity.

receptor (rar) a gene to part of the  xxxg1785xxx 
gene, creating an aberrant  xxxd3417xxx  receptor fusion protein
that leads to dysregulated myeloid differentiation (4). atra is
able to overcome this maturation arrest and reestablish
myeloid differentiation (4, 5). atra has become part of
standard first-line therapy for apl and has lead to significant
improvements in survival (6). unfortunately, apl is an
uncommon subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (aml) and
atra therapy has no clinical effect on the more common
non-m3 aml (7).
 xxxd330xxx  is another retinoid agonist that is commonly used
in the treatment of t-cell lymphomas (8, 9). in contrast to
atra, which has strong affinity for rar receptors and only
weak binding to retinoic x receptor (rxr) receptors,  xxxd330xxx 
is biased toward binding to rxrs (10, 11). in vitro,  xxxd330xxx 
inhibits growth and induces differentiation of hl-60 leukemia
cell lines as well as leukemic cells from patients with aml (12).
based on this preclinical rationale, we initiated a phase i dose
escalation study to establish a safe treatment dose and to
explore the toxicity and preliminary efficacy of  xxxd330xxx  in
non-m3 aml.

cancer therapy: clinical
of an institutional review board – approved clinical trial. written
informed consent was obtained from all patients. eligible patients
were those with active biopsy-proven non-m3 aml, age z18 years,
eastern cooperative oncology group performance status of 0 to 2,
prior treatment with chemotherapy or not eligible for conventional
chemotherapy, and recovered from any toxicities of prior therapy.
major exclusion criteria included history of prior pancreatitis, active
alcohol abuse, wbc count >10,000/al, serum triglycerides levels
>1,000 ml/dl, other concurrent aml therapies, history of myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant, uncontrolled active infection,
known active central nervous system involvement with aml, use of
blood growth factors within the past week, or significant organ
dysfunction (total bilirubin, transaminase greater than three times the
upper limit of normal or creatinine >4 mg/dl).
study design. this dose escalation trial followed the standard threeplus-three cohort escalation design. daily dose levels evaluated ranged
from 100 to 300 mg/m2 in 50 mg/m2 increments and then 400 mg/m2.
dose-limiting toxicity (dlt) was defined as grade z4 (national cancer
institute cancer therapy evaluation program 3.0) toxicity occurring
within 28 days of drug initiation. patients with dlt that had resolved
or had intolerable grade <4 adverse events would be allowed to
reinitiate  xxxd330xxx  at the next lower dose level. dose escalations were
not permitted for individual patients. new patient cohorts were opened
after 28 days of follow-up had passed for all patients in the previous
dose cohort and if no dlts had occurred in the initial three patients or
only one dlt had occurred in six patients in the prior dose cohort. the
maximum tolerated dose was defined as the dose level below, which
more than one of three or two of six patients experienced dlt.
treatment plan.  xxxd330xxx  capsules were administered orally daily
with food. patients continued treatment as long as they were on study.
patients were also concurrently initiated on either 48 mg/d  xxxd2096xxx 
or 10 mg/d atorvastatin as prophylactic treatment for hypertriglyceridemia. patients were not allowed to take other concurrent antileukemic therapies or erythoid or myeloid growth factors while on study.
exceptions to this rule were made for hydroxyurea for the first 21 days
of study enrollment for initial control of peripheral blood leukemic
blasts in patients with wbc >10,000/al and for myeloid growth factors
for up to 3 weeks in the case of infection. patients with dlt events or
who were unable to tolerate  xxxd330xxx  for grade 3 event would
withhold drug for up to 3 weeks to resolve the adverse event. they were
then eligible to reinitiate  xxxd330xxx  at the previously tested next lower
dose level. patients continued on treatment until they experienced
progressive disease as manifested by wbc >20,000/al with >75% blasts
or unacceptable toxicity.
patient monitoring. patients were evaluated at a minimum of every
2 weeks with full history, physical evaluation, and laboratory studies.
triglycerides and thyroid function studies were done at 2 weeks and
then monthly thereafter. bone marrow biopsy was done at 2 weeks,
2 months, and then every 3 months thereafter.
response assessment. patient response to therapy was based on
changes in their peripheral blood counts and bone marrow blast
percentage. bone marrow response was defined as a decrease in bone
marrow core blast percentage of >50% or an absolute blast percentage
of v5%. patients with neutrophil count improvement had to have had a
pre- xxxd330xxx  absolute neutrophil count (anc) <1,500/mm3 with at
least a 100% improvement or absolute increase of >500/mm3,
whichever was greater, after initiation of therapy. platelet response
was defined as achievement of transfusion independence (baseline
platelet count of <20,000/mm3) or an absolute increase of 50,000/mm3.
the patient bone marrow and hematologic response data were also
evaluated using the modified international working group response
criteria for myelodysplasia in an effort to provide a standardized method
for response (13).
flow separation and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. pereripheral blood granulocytes were purified by cell sorting for  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  and
cd45 as described previously (14). granulocytic purity was confirmed
by cytospin and microscopic examination. fluorescence in situ

clin cancer res 2008;14(17) september 1, 2008

hybridization analysis was done on the purified granulocytes using
probes for the given patient’s known leukemic cytogenetic abnormality.
statistical analysis. all survival distributions and rates were
calculated according to the kaplan-meier method. response variables
were examined using the m2 test. all p values reported are two tailed.
statistical analysis was done with the stata software (stata version 9,
2005).

results
patient characteristics. as shown in table 1, 27 adult
patients with non-m3 aml were treated on study. this patient
population had a median age of 69 years with poor prognostic
factors (48% with prior myelodysplastic syndrome, 44% with
primary refractory, and 26% with complete response lasting
<12 months). eighty-nine percent had had prior induction
chemotherapy with 59% having had z2 induction attempts.
nineteen percent had undergone prior autologous stem cell
transplantation. at the time of enrollment, the majority had
significant cytopenias and five patients had wbc >10,000/al
and were on hydroxyurea.
dose escalation and maximum tolerated dose determination. a
total of 27 patients were treated on six dose levels between
100 and 400 mg/m 2 (table 2). the median number
of days on therapy was 39 with a range of 4 to >527 days.
 xxxd330xxx  was well tolerated overall with only one dlt
consisting of altered mental status being recorded (table 3). in
retrospect, it was likely that the single reported dlt was due to
concurrent sepsis rather than study drug. at the highest tested

dose level (400 mg/m2), three of six patients had their dose of
 xxxd330xxx  reduced due to grade 3 rash, anorexia, or fatigue
that was felt by the patients to be intolerable. although an
official maximum tolerated dose as determined by the
occurrence of dlts was not identified, a dose of 300 mg/m2
was established as the suggested patient tolerable dose. due to
the patients’ preexisting active aml, data pertaining to
leukemia-related side effects, including neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, petechiae, and weight loss,
were not used in the assessment of dlt. overall  xxxd330xxx  was
well tolerated with dose-dependent and reversible toxicities.
the most common significant side effects of  xxxd330xxx  were
hypertriglyceridemia and hypothyroidism. these adverse events
were not graded due to prophylactic and early therapeutic
intervention. hypertriglyceridemia occurred in 19 (70%)
patients despite the prophylactic use of antihyperlipidemic
agents and appeared to be more severe in patients treated with
higher  xxxd330xxx  doses. aggressive use of antihyperlipidemic
agents controlled patient triglyceride levels in all patients.
hypothyroidism was detected in 11 (41%) of patients and was
easily treated with low doses of thyroid replacement hormone.
response and treatment outcome. no patients achieved a
complete response with blood count recovery. however, 5
(19%) patients achieved significant reduction in bone marrow
blasts with 4 (15%) patients reducing their bone marrow blast
percentage to v5% (fig. 1; table 4a). by modified international working group criteria, 5 (19%) of patients achieved a
marrow complete response. eleven (41%) patients had
improvements in their platelet counts with 5 transfusiondependent patients achieving transfusion independence
(table 4b). three patients with improved platelet counts
who were not transfusion dependent were on hydroxyurea at
the time of study enrollment. therefore, some of their platelet
count improvement may have been due to discontinuation of
hydroxyurea. by modified international working group
criteria, 4 (15%) of 26 patients who were thrombocytopenic
at the time of study initiation had a platelet response. none of
the patients with an international working group criteria
platelet response were on hydroxyurea at the time of study
initiation. seven (26%) patients, who had anc <1,500/mm3
at study enrollment, had improvement in their neutrophil
counts (table 4c). by modified international working group
criteria, 2 (10%) of 20 patients who were neutropenic at the
time of study initiation had a neutrophil response. median
overall survival is 3.4 months with a range of 0.1 to >18.8
months. three patients survived >1 year on study, with 2

having significant improvement in their blood counts (fig. 2).
twenty-three patients have died due to progressive disease
(13), infection (8), stroke (1), or bleeding (1). no deaths
noted on study have been felt to be due to adverse events
related to  xxxd330xxx  but universally reflect issues related to
the patients’ underlying leukemia.
evidence of myeloid differentiation. three patients with
improving anc were studied for evidence of myeloid differentiation. peripheral blood granulocytes were purified and
subjected to fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis for the
patient’s known cytogenetic abnormality. the majority (92%,
100%, and 96%) of the peripheral blood granulocytes in the 3
patients studied (patients 8, 9, and 15) contained the patients
known leukemic cytogenetic abnormality [5q-, t(8,21), and 5q-]
suggesting a leukemic origin with myeloid differentiation.
two patients (patients 7 and 9) developed a syndrome
similar to the differentiation syndrome induced by atra or
 xxxd226xxx  (ato) in apl therapy. this was characterized
by respiratory distress,  xxxd1861xxx , weight gain/edema, and
pericardial and/or pleural effusion in the setting of a rapidly
rising neutrophil count. no pulmonary infiltrates were noted
by computed tomographic scans. symptoms in both patients
resolved within 48 hours after discontinuation of  xxxd330xxx 
and initiation of dexamethasone. radiographic findings
resolved within 2 to 4 weeks.

discussion
this phase i study has defined a clinically active and tolerable
dose of  xxxd330xxx  for patients with non-m3 aml. importantly,
we identified no severe dlts in this population. in addition, we
identified laboratory and clinical evidence of differentiation of
non-m3 myeloid leukemic cells in response to retinoid x
receptor activation as well as evidence of clinical response in
chemotherapy refractory non-m3 aml. the findings establish
retinoid x receptor agonists as a novel class of therapeutic
agents for the treatment of non-m3 aml.
this trial has identified 300 mg/m2 as the maximum patient
tolerable dose for  xxxd330xxx  in patients with aml. our study
was originally done in a phase i format to identify aml-specific
side effects of  xxxd330xxx  that might reduce the standard
treatment dose. in previous phase i and ii studies in patient
with cutaneous t-cell lymphoma and solid tumors,  xxxd330xxx 
was tested up to 600 mg/m2 and found to be safe but difficult
to tolerate (9, 15). in addition, in a trial of cutaneous t-cell
lymphoma, there was no difference in efficacy between

due to early therapeutic intervention, it was not possible to grade hypertriglyceridemia and hypothyroidism.

300 mg/m2 and higher doses (9). based on those trials, the
standard treatment dose of  xxxd330xxx  is 300 mg/m2. our trial
confirms that although the 400 mg/m2 dose level is safe, the
long-term patient tolerability is poor. when treating patients
with relapsed or refractory aml or older patients ineligible for
standard chemotherapy, palliative therapies must be well
tolerated over time to ensure patient compliance and maximized quality of life. given the differences in long-term drug
tolerability between 300 and 400 mg/m2, we believe that
300 mg/m2 should be the dose used in future clinical trials for aml.
the adverse events associated with  xxxd330xxx  use in aml
patients closely mirror those reported previously in cutaneous
t-cell lymphoma and lung cancer patients. hypertriglyceridemia and hypothyroidism were frequent, but with close
observation and early intervention, easily manageable (9).
events that affected quality of life including bone pain, nausea,
anorexia, edema, and rash occurred but were low grade, dose
dependent, and reversible. before this trial, there was a concern
that  xxxd330xxx  adverse events may not be well tolerated in
aml patients or that previously unreported adverse events
might occur. in our aml patient population,  xxxd330xxx  did
not appear to worsen the clinical status of our patients.
we observed in two patients a differentiation syndrome
similar to that induced by atra or ato in apl, which suggests

that  xxxd330xxx  can induce leukemic differentiation in non-m3
aml (14, 16). although our patients had a syndrome similar to
that seen with atra- or ato-induced differentiation syndrome, no pulmonary infiltrates were noted. it is possible that
pulmonary infiltrates may occur in future patients treated with
 xxxd330xxx  or that  xxxd330xxx -induced differentiation syndrome is in some way different from that caused by atra or
ato. in m3 aml patients treated with atra or ato,
differentiation syndrome typically occurs as the wbc is rising
due to leukemic blast differentiation induced by atra or ato.
the syndrome is felt to be due to cytokine release induced by
the maturing myeloid cells. in patients with non-m3 aml
treated with atra on previous clinical trials, neither clinical
activity nor differentiation syndrome was noted, suggesting that
the two activities are linked. given that differentiation
syndrome and similar pulmonary syndromes have not been
reported previously in nonleukemia patients treated with
 xxxd330xxx , it is likely that this reaction is not a direct side
effect of  xxxd330xxx  but rather that it is a therapeutic
consequence of the leukemic differentiating activity induced
by  xxxd330xxx  (7). in our two patients, differentiation
syndrome was rapidly resolved with cessation of  xxxd330xxx 
and institution of steroids. neither patient was restarted on
 xxxd330xxx  within our clinical trial due to this significant

phase i trial of  xxxd330xxx  in non-m3 aml

study, limiting our ability to quantitate any changes induced
by  xxxd330xxx . two patients experienced a pulmonary
syndrome reminiscent of atra or differentiation syndrome
seen in m3 aml patients. the finding of differentiation
syndrome in our patients further suggests that the mechanism
of  xxxd330xxx  may be from differentiation of the leukemic
blasts. given that  xxxd330xxx  has only low affinity for rar
and that atra has no effect on non-m3 aml, one must
postulate a different mechanism than pure rar agonist
activity. rar and rxr receptors are known to heterodimerize
and interact with one another. it is possible that these rar/
rxr heterodimers have downstream activities that affect
neutrophil differentiation. whereas leukemic blast differentiation in m3 aml may occur through the rar pathway, rxr
activity may be needed to achieve similar effects in non-m3
aml. in addition, given that  xxxd330xxx  has low-level affinity
for rar receptors as well as high affinity for rxr receptors,
costimulation of both rar and rxr receptors may be
involved in the differentiation of non-m3 aml. further
laboratory studies will be needed to identify the mechanism
of action of  xxxd330xxx .

adverse event. after achieving a bone marrow blasts reduction
to <5% and clearance of peripheral blood blasts with
 xxxd330xxx , one patient did well clinically for 1 month after
drug discontinuation before presenting with explosive recurrent
disease and expired without ever restarting  xxxd330xxx  (16).
the second patient restarted  xxxd330xxx  off study at half his
previous dose without recurrent differentiation syndrome but
ultimately developed progressive disease a few weeks later. it
remains to be seen if patients can be rechallenged with full-dose
 xxxd330xxx  after initially developing differentiation syndrome.
with close monitoring for differentiation syndrome,  xxxd330xxx 
appears to be a safe and well-tolerated therapy in patients with
non-m3 aml.
our data suggest that  xxxd330xxx  induces the differentiation
of leukemic blasts into functioning neutrophils. in three
responding patients tested, essentially all peripheral blood
neutrophils contained the respective patient’s known leukemic
cytogenetic abnormality, suggesting a leukemic origin to these
cells. unfortunately, only three patients’ peripheral blood were
tested by fluorescence in situ hybridization and no patient had
peripheral blood fluorescence in situ hybridization done pre-

note: platelet counts are shown in thousands per mm3. for designation of neutrophil response, a patient had to have had pre- xxxd330xxx  anc
<1,500/mm3 with at least a 100% improvement or absolute increase of >500/mm3, whichever was greater. patients were not allowed to have
taken granulocyte  xxxg526xxx  at the time of anc assessment.
*patients 13, 14, and 16 were initially on hydroxyurea at the time of their pre- xxxd330xxx  platelet count.

cancer therapy: clinical

fig. 2. graph of peripheral blood neutrophil, leukemic
blasts, and platelet counts over time in patients 8
(bottom) and 18 (top). patient 8 was removed from
the study for progressive disease on day +396. patient
18 remains on study on day 565+.

significant evidence of clinical activity was seen as manifested by improved blood counts and reduction in bone
marrow blasts. several patients showed increases in their
neutrophil counts or platelet counts. in patients with active
aml, these effects are important as pancytopenia with resulting
infections and transfusion dependency is common. unlike
current cytotoxic therapies for aml,  xxxd330xxx  appears to have
relatively minimal bone marrow suppressive side effects and
leads to improved blood counts in patients while on therapy.
currently, many patients with aml are treated with supportive
care only due to the potential risks of worsening pancytopenia
from chemotherapy.  xxxd330xxx  may provide a new therapeutic
option that would not carry the risks of conventional
chemotherapy. the positive effects of this therapy can be
long-lasting in some patients, freeing patients from platelet
transfusions and significantly improving their overall quality of
life. patients with aml frequently do not die directly from
progressive aml but rather indirectly from infection and
bleeding complications. although most hematologic responses
were short lived in our phase i study, often due to progressive
aml, it is hoped that with proper dosing of  xxxd330xxx  that the
responses may be more robust and longer lived. in our study,
three patients with relapsed or refractory aml have lived
>1 year while on  xxxd330xxx  alone, suggesting the possibility
for improvement in survival in a subset of patients.
although we have identified evidence of clinical activity of
 xxxd330xxx  monotherapy in non-m3 aml patients, the overall

clin cancer res 2008;14(17) september 1, 2008

activity was low and transient in the majority of patients. as
this was a phase i dose-finding study, it is hoped that, with
proper dose administration and patient selection in future
trials, the overall effect of  xxxd330xxx  monotherapy will be
greater. the ultimate use of  xxxd330xxx  may, however, be in
conjunction with other antileukemic agents. other retinoic
acids such as atra have been shown to improve survival in
m3 aml patients when used in conjunction with conventional chemotherapy and may improve patient outcome as well
when used with nonchemotherapeutic agents such as ato.
further clinical investigations using  xxxd330xxx  with other
agents are ongoing.
we have shown that  xxxd330xxx  has significant clinical
activity in non-m3 aml and identified a safe and welltolerated dose in this patient population. there is a significant
need for novel well-tolerated therapies in patients with
refractory non-m3 aml and in older patients not otherwise
eligible for induction chemotherapy. given that  xxxd330xxx 
has minimal bone marrow suppressive side effects and works
in a manner different from cytotoxic chemotherapy, it is a
promising agent for these patients and should be further
investigated.
