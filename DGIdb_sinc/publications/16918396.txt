abstract: antipsychotic drugs (apd) are widely prescribed for the treatment of schizophrenia. the apd are differentiated into typical and atypical based on the lower incidence of extra-pyramidal side-effects associated with the newer
atypical apd. it was suggested that atypicality may arise from an interaction with the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht)2 receptor and specifically on the 5-ht2:dopamine d2 affinity ratio. it is now realised that multiple subtypes of these receptors
exist and that in addition, atypical apd interact with many monoamine receptors. the aim of the present study was to
characterise the interaction of apd with a variety of monoamine receptors in terms of both affinity and efficacy. the data
produced has highlighted that the atypical profile of apd such as olanzapine and clozapine may reflect antagonism of the
5-ht2a and 5-ht2c receptors, whilst that of, ziprasidone and quetiapine may reflect partial agonist activity at the 5-ht1a
receptor, and that of aripiprazole may reflect partial agonist activity at the  xxxg1108xxx  as well as is its claimed partial
agonist activity at the  xxxg656xxx .

pharmacological profile of antipsychotic drugs
antipsychotic drugs (apd, also known as neuroleptics)
are amongst the most widely prescribed drugs in the world.
traditional apd, such as haloperidol and fluphenazine, were
developed almost 50 years ago and have been shown to improve the symptoms of schizophrenia by selective blockade
of the  xxxg656xxx  [1]. however, chronic blockade
of the dopamine d2 receptors is also associated with the induction of motor disturbances, commonly referred to as extrapyramidal side-effects (eps). these eps include acute
dystonic reaction, subacute effects such as akathesia and
chronic effects such as tardive dyskinesia, which develops in
at least 20% of patients treated chronically with traditional
antipsychotics [2, 3].
the introduction of chlorpromazine for the treatment of
schizophrenia and the subsequent development of clozapine
[4] which had markedly fewer or no eps [5], fuelled the
development of new antipsychotics. clozapine and other
novel antipsychotics displaying a low incidence of eps were
termed atypical. with the identification of  xxxg1113xxx 
subtype and the subsequent identification that clozapine was
a potent  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist [6] this pharmacological
trait was shown to be a common feature of atypical apd [2].
subsequently it was suggested that the classification of
atypical vs. typical could be made based on compounds possessing a higher  xxxg1113xxx  affinity compared to  xxxg656xxx  affinity [7]. however, there are two issues with this
classification. firstly it is now known that there are multiple

subtypes of the d2 and 5-ht2 receptors as then studied and
secondly the apd interact with many receptors other than d2
and 5-ht2 receptors.
since the discovery of apd, molecular cloning techniques have resulted in the identification of multiple receptor
subtypes for all of the monoamine receptors. receptor cloning techniques have identified d1, d2, d3 , d4 and d5 receptors [8] and furthermore, splice variants of the  xxxg656xxx 
have been identified that are referred to as d2-short, -long
and -longer [9]. it is also now realised that all of the clinically active apd interact with both the d2 and d3 receptors
and that an interaction with the  xxxg657xxx  may
contribute to their therapeutic profile [10]. similarly multiple
subtypes of the  xxxg1113xxx  have been identified using
radioligand binding and molecular cloning studies and have
been defined as 5-ht2a, 5-ht2b and 5-ht2c [11].
both the atypical and typical antipsychotics interact with
many monoaminergic receptors beyond those for 5-ht2 and
dopamine, which may contribute to both differences in efficacy and in side-effect profile between the apd. thus clozapine has greater clinical efficacy against both positive and
negative symptoms and has become the drug of choice for
treatment-resistant schizophrenia [12]. although atypical
antipsychotics represented a marked improvement in treatment due to their reduced eps propensity, they are still associated with major side-effects including prolactinaemia, sedation, orthostasis, constipation and weight gain [13]. in
order to further profile the pharmacological interactions of
atypical and typical antipsychotic agents, and to gain insights
into the receptor mechanisms responsible for efficacy and in
the clinic, we have studied the interaction of these drugs both
in radioligand binding and receptor function studies. we
have focussed on the pharmacological profile of the typical

obtained from sigma (poole, uk). clozapine and (s)-(-)
sulpiride were obtained from tocris (avonmouth, uk). all
other drugs were synthesised in the department of medicinal
chemistry, psychiatry cedd, glaxosmithkline, harlow,
uk. compounds were dissolved in  xxxd2982xxx :dimethyl sulphoxide (1:1) and radioligand binding studies performed according to table 1. ic50 values were estimated from the counts per minute using a four parameter
logistic curve fit within excel [18]. ki values were calculated using the method of cheng and prusoff [20] and pki
was defined as the negative log10 of the ki.

apd haloperidol and chlorpromazine, the established apd
clozapine and risperidone, the recently introduced atypical
apd olanzapine, ziprasidone and quetiapine and the partial
 xxxg656xxx  agonist aripiprazole. whilst these
compounds have been compared and reviewed in terms of
receptor binding affinities, none have studied the functional
interaction of the apd with the various receptors. the receptor binding profiles of these drugs has been reviewed elsewhere [10, 14, 15]. additional reviews have highlighted the
side-effect liabilities for many of these agents, such as the
link between short-term weight gain and  xxxg1078xxx  affinity [15] highlighting the need for more selective
agents [16]. we have therefore focussed on the interaction of
these drugs with serotonin and dopamine receptor subtypes
that are central to their antipsychotic profile [4, 17]. to do
this we have utilised recombinant human receptors expressed
in cell lines and studied radioligand binding in membranes
and receptor function in cells and membranes. additional
data for other agents such as raclopride,  xxxd2330xxx  and  xxxd2637xxx  has been included where available.

[35s]-gtps binding studies in recombinant cells expressing human 5-ht1a, 5-ht1b or  xxxg1110xxx  receptors were
performed as described by watson et al. [21,22].

determination of the interaction of
antipsychotic drugs with neurotransmitter receptors

changes in intracellular calcium were determined using
the flipr in sh-sy5y cells expressing either human 5ht2a, 5-ht2b or 5-ht2c receptors [18].

binding to neurotransmitter receptors
for these studies, drugs were obtained form various
sources. haloperidol, chlorpromazine and spiperone were
table 1.

functional studies on neurotransmitter receptors
the functional interaction of apds with various monoamine receptors was studied using a variety of protocols to
determine potency and agonist/antagonist activity.

changes in camp levels in hela cells expressing the
human  xxxg1119xxx  were determined using the camp
flashplate assay kit [54].

pharmacological profile of antipsychotics at monoamine receptors

cns & neurological disorders - drug targets, 2006, vol. 5, no. 4

[35s]-gtps binding studies in cho cells stably expressing either hd2 or hd3 receptors were performed as described
by gardner et al. [23] except that a scintillation proximity
assay (spa) format was used.

whereas ziprasidone showed high affinity for this receptor
(table 2). in functional studies, clozapine, ziprasidone and
aripiprazole were partial agonists in the [35s]-gtps assay
(table 3) whereas chlorpromazine, spiperone, and  xxxd3195xxx 
were inverse agonists (fig. 1).

concentration-effect curves were analysed using a 4parameter logistic function to obtain pec50 and pic50 values
(from inhibition of the effects of a concentration of the agonist concentration producing 70-80% of the maximal response) with antagonist  xxxg2342xxx  determined from the pic50
[24]. curve fitting was performed either in excel [18] or
using prism 3 (graphpad software, san diego, ca, usa).
all data are means + standard error of the mean from at least
3 separate determinations.
compounds with a pki >8 were deemed to have high
affinity, those with a pki >7 and <8 were deemed to have
moderate affinity and those with a pki <7 were deemed to
have low affinity.
observed profile of antipsychotic drugs
in neurotransmitter receptor binding
and functional studies
5-ht1 receptor subtypes
most of the compounds displayed low (pki 6-7) to moderate (pki 7-8) affinity for the 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx 
receptor subtypes (table 2). exceptions were aripiprazole
and  xxxd2330xxx , which exhibited high affinity for the  xxxg1110xxx 
receptor and ziprasidone which exhibited high affinity for
the 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors.
at the  xxxg1108xxx , the apd exhibited a wide range
of affinities. thus raclopride, haloperidol and chlorpromaz
ine all displayed low affinity for the  xxxg1108xxx ,
table 2.

at the  xxxg1111xxx  and  xxxg1112xxx  receptors, all apd displayed
low or very low (pki <6) affinity (table 4).
 xxxg1113xxx  subtypes
with the exception of quetiapine and raclopride, all of
the atypical apd displayed moderate to high affinity for the
5-ht2a, 5-ht2b and 5-ht2c receptors (table 5). this is in
contrast to the typical apd haloperidol which displayed
moderate affinity for all three receptor subtypes. most of the
apd, such as chlorpromazine, clozapine, olanzapine,  xxxd3195xxx  and ziprasidone, displayed similar affinities at all three
 xxxg1113xxx  subtypes. however, risperidone and  xxxd2330xxx  preferentially interacted with the  xxxg1113xxx  and
aripiprazole displayed almost 10 fold selectivity for the 5ht2b receptor. raclopride and quetiapine displayed low affinity for all three receptors.
in functional studies on the flipr, none of the compounds displayed agonist-like activity at any of the 5-ht2
receptors. in general there was a good agreement between
binding and functional affinities, although there was a trend
for functional affinity at the  xxxg1113xxx  to be up to 10fold lower than that seen in radioligand binding studies (table 6). despite this, compounds such as  xxxd2330xxx , spiperone and risperidone still exhibited selectivity as  xxxg1113xxx  antagonists and aripiprazole showed greater than 10fold selectivity as a  xxxg1114xxx  antagonist.

and d3 receptors). none of the apd significantly discriminated between d2 and d3 receptors although some, such as
olanzapine, exhibited a slightly higher affinity for the d 2
receptor (5 fold). most of the compounds possessed moderate to low affinity for the dopamine  xxxg658xxx , with the
exception of haloperidol and  xxxd2330xxx  which displayed
high affinity for this receptor.

 xxxg1117xxx  and 5-ht7 receptor
none of the compounds tested had significant affinity for
the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor (table 6). most of the compounds displayed moderate affinity for the 5-ht7 receptor, with risperidone and ziprasidone displaying high affinity (pki 8.54 and
8.26 respectively) for this receptor.
 xxxg1119xxx 
in radioligand binding studies (table 7), whereas apd
displayed moderate affinity for the  xxxg1119xxx ,  xxxd3195xxx  displayed high affinity for this receptor (pki 9.05).
in functional studies, the apd compounds tested lacked
agonist-like activity at the  xxxg1119xxx  and most antagonised the effects of 5-ht with moderate to low functional
antagonist potency (table 7). the one exception was
aripiprazole which exhibited very low antagonist potency
(pkb < 6). it should be noted that the apd tested were more
potent in radioligand binding studies than in functional studies, such that the high binding affinity seen with  xxxd3195xxx 
was only translated into moderate functional affinity.
dopamine d2, d3 and  xxxg658xxx 
in radioligand binding studies, almost all of the compounds tested displayed moderate (pki 7-8) to high (pki >8)
affinity for both the dopamine d2 and d3 receptors (table 8).
only quetiapine displayed low affinity (pki c6.5 at both d 2

in functional studies at the human d2 and d3 receptors,
quinpirole was a potent agonist inducing a marked increase
in [35s]-gtps binding with pec50s of 6.84 + 0.05 and 8.33
+ 0.05 respectively. none of the apd examined displayed
agonist-like activity in this assay. in antagonist studies, the
ability of the test compound to inhibit a sub-maximal effect
of quinpirole (1 mum at d2 and 0.1 mum at d3 receptors) was
examined. there was good agreement between functional
affinity (pkb) and binding affinity (table 9). thus none of
the compounds discriminated between d2 and d3 receptors
and all exhibited high or moderate potency for these receptors with the exception of quetiapine which displayed low
potency for the  xxxg656xxx .
implications for the profile of antipsychotic drugs
in this report the pharmacological profile of a number of
antipsychotic drugs (apd) at a variety of human monoaminergic receptors has been examined, in terms of both
affinity (as determined from radioligand binding studies) and
of efficacy (as determined from functional studies). although the receptor binding profile of many apd has been
compared, there are no studies that have compared both
binding and function for a variety of apd at an extensive
range of receptors.
in general there was a good agreement in affinity estimates from functional and radioligand binding studies, especially where the compounds displayed antagonist properties.
some exceptions to this included aripiprazole which was
more potent on function vs. binding at the dopamine d2 and
d3 receptors but less potent on function vs. binding at the 5ht2a, 5-ht2b and 5-ht2c receptors and risperidone which
was less potent on function vs binding at the 5-ht2a, 5ht2b and 5-ht2c receptors. the reason for these differences
is not clear, but it may reflect the ability of a drug to interact
with different conformations of the receptor [37].

based on the current study, it appears that most of the
apd interact equally well with the 5-ht2a, 5-ht2b and 5ht2c receptor subtypes. however, aripiprazole displayed
high affinity and some selectivity for the  xxxg1114xxx 
over the 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c receptors. aripiprazole was an
antagonist at the  xxxg1114xxx , consistent with the findings of shapiro et al. [14] who found it to be an  xxxd1422xxx  at this receptor. other exceptions are risperidone and
 xxxd2330xxx , compounds which had a higher affinity for the
 xxxg1113xxx  than for the  xxxg1115xxx . in functional
studies, risperidone, quetiapine and perospirone displayed
some selectivity for the  xxxg1113xxx  compared to the 5ht2c receptor.
although it has been suggested that an interaction with
the  xxxg1113xxx  may be responsible for the low propensity
of atypical apd to induce eps, recent studies have suggested that this property may be mediated through antagonism of the  xxxg1115xxx  and not the  xxxg1113xxx  [38,
39]. it is interesting to note that, in support of this hypothe

sis, risperidone, which exhibits low  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist activity, is associated with an increased eps risk at high
doses in the clinic [40]. further, this may suggest that the
lower functional affinity compared to binding affinity displayed by risperidone at the 5-ht2a, 5-ht2b and 5-ht2c
receptors may reflect the in vivo situation. in the present
study,  xxxd2330xxx  was highly selective for the  xxxg1113xxx  as compared to the  xxxg1115xxx .  xxxd2330xxx , which
has high affinity for 1 adrenergic receptors and 5-ht2a receptors and intermediate affinity for 5-ht2c receptors, is
reported as a novel apd currently in phase ii clinical trials
[41]. in neurochemical studies,  xxxd2330xxx  has been show to
increase medial prefrontal cortex da release, probably
through a combination of dopamine d2 and  xxxg831xxx  adrenergic
receptor blockade [42]. in view of the low  xxxg1115xxx 
affinity, it will be interesting to determine what level of eps
liability  xxxd2330xxx  displays in the clinic. quetiapine was
unusual in that it had little or no affinity for the  xxxg1113xxx  subtypes, but did display moderate functional antagonism
that agrees with published data [43].

ziprasidone and aripiprazole also displayed partial agonist activity at the human  xxxg1109xxx  although their
level of intrinsic activity was below that of the internal standard, sb-216641 [47], an observation that predicts antagonist actions in vivo [48]. for ziprasidone, its affinity for the
 xxxg1109xxx  is similar to that for the  xxxg656xxx , suggesting  xxxg1109xxx  antagonism may contribute
to its overall clinical profile, potentially contributing to antidepressant activity [49]. in contrast, aripiprazole displayed a
large separation in binding affinities between the dopamine
 xxxg656xxx  and the  xxxg1109xxx .

data are mean + s.e.m. from 3-6 separate determinations.
nd-not detrmined.

another mechanism that has been proposed to modulate
the daergic system and reduce the development of eps is  xxxg1108xxx  receptor agonism [17]. thus,  xxxg1108xxx  agonists
such as 8-oh-dpat and ipsapirone attenuate the eps-like
side effects of haloperidol [44]. interestingly,  xxxg1108xxx  agonists stimulate the release of da in the prefrontal cortex and potentiate the effects of  xxxg656xxx  blockade on da release by apd in a manner similar to that of 5ht2 receptor antagonists [17]. in the present study, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, clozapine and quetiapine all displayed
agonist/partial-agonist activity at the human 5-ht1a receptable 7.

tor. although quetiapine has been reported to display 5-ht1a
receptor agonist activity, as assessed by stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase activity [45] and stimulation of
[35s]-gtps binding [46], this activity was observed only at
high concentrations with an ec50 of 11 mum. in the current
study, quetiapine was a moderately potent partial agonist at
the  xxxg1108xxx  with a pec50 of 6.3 and an intrinsic activity of 0.74, suggesting that this activity should contribute
to the pharmacological profile of quetiapine in the clinic.
interestingly, chlorpromazine and spiperone displayed  xxxd1422xxx  properties, albeit with low potency.

none of the compounds displayed significant interactions
with the  xxxg1111xxx ,  xxxg1112xxx  or  xxxg1117xxx  receptors. clozapine,
chlorpromazine, olanzapine and  xxxd2330xxx  displayed moderate affinity and antagonist activity for the  xxxg1119xxx 
and this may contribute to their clinical profile. antagonism
at the  xxxg1119xxx  may improve cognition via facilitation
of cortical and hippocampal glutamatergic activity and perhaps acetylcholine release [50, 51]. selective  xxxg1119xxx 
antagonists enhance cognition in pre-clinical studies [52] and
this may be useful in treating the cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. many of the apds showed significant affinity for the 5-ht7 receptor with risperidone and
ziprasidone showing high affinity for this receptor. recent
studies have suggested that the 5-ht7 receptor may modulate
emotionality and play a role in the regulation of circadian
rhythms, suggesting potential utility in depression [52, 53].

at the  xxxg656xxx  has been shown to vary with the cell type
and the signal transduction pathway examined, such that it
may appear as an antagonist in some assays and a partial
agonist in others [14]. it therefore appears that although  xxxg656xxx  blockade may be responsible for antipsychotic efficacy of typical and atypical apd, there are a
number of receptor interactions including  xxxg1108xxx 
agonism and 5-ht2a and  xxxg1115xxx  antagonism, which
may contribute to the atypicality of the newer drugs with
reduced eps.

interest in the role of serotonin receptors in the profile of
apd arose from the superior efficacy and tolerability of
atypical apd such as clozapine, aripiprazole and olanzapine.
relatively potent blockade of 5-ht2a receptors coupled to
weaker antagonism at dopamine d2 receptors was found to
be the only classical feature shared by these atypical apds
[17]. the present study has highlighted the broad profile of
interaction of typical and atypical apd with dopamine and
serotonin receptors. specifically it has raised the role of 5ht2c receptor antagonism as opposed to  xxxg1113xxx 
antagonism in the control of extra-pyramidal side-effects. it
has also raised the potential of  xxxg1108xxx  antagonism
in reducing eps liability as seen in quetiapine. although
aripiprazole has been developed as a  xxxg656xxx 
partial agonist, in this study aripiprazole was an antagonist at
hd2 receptors and a partial agonist at 5-ht1a receptors. indeed, it has been suggested that some of its atypical properties may be a consequence of agonist activity at the 5-ht1a
receptor [17]. further, the functional activity of aripiprazole
