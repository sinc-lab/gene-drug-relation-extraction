to study the mechanism by which cholecystokininoctapeptide (cck-8) and its potent analogue,  xxxd464xxx , prevent glutamate-inducedneuronal
cell death in rat neuron cultures, we examined the effect of both peptides on glutamate-induced increases in the intracellular free calcium
concentrations ([ca2+ ]i), which are known to be a crucial trigger of the neurodegeneration induced by glutamate. cck-8 itself did not alter
[ca2+]i in rat neuron cultures. glutamate increased [ca2+]i in neuron cultures rapidly and markedly. cck-8 and  xxxd464xxx  significantly
suppressed the increases in [ca2+ ]i induced by glutamate. the maximum inhibitory effects of cck-8 and  xxxd464xxx   xxxd1891xxx -6 m reached 43 and
46% of the response to glutamate, respectively.gastrin-i and cck-4 also significantlyattenuated the increases in [ca2+ ]i induced by glutamate.
the inhibitoryeffect of cck-8 was completelyblocked by the selective antagonist for  xxxg353xxx  receptors, ( + )l-365,260, but not by ( - )l-364,718,
which is a selective antagonist for  xxxg352xxx  receptors. cck-8 significantlysuppressed [ca2+ ]i response to kainate and high concentrations of
extracellular k +, but not to n-methyl-d-aspartate. with cultured astrocytes, cck-8 did not inhibit the increment of [ca2+]i induced by
glutamate. these findings clearly demonstrated that cck-8 and  xxxd464xxx  inhibit glutamate-induced increases in [ca2+]i in neuron cultures
through  xxxg353xxx  receptors, suggesting that cck-8 may participate in the central actions of glutamate.

introduction
cholecystokinin octapeptide (cck-8) is widely distributed in the brain and especially in high concentrations in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus 27'39 cck8 has been demonstrated to have a wide range of
central actions including effects on feeding behaviors,
nociception, dopamine-involving behaviors, anxiety, and
learning and memory processes 19'22'23'46. on the basis
of ligand binding, cck receptors are classified into
peripheral and central types, namely  xxxg352xxx  and cckb receptors, respectively 7'8'2°. the brain is especially
rich in receptors of the  xxxg353xxx  subtype although ccka receptors are present in discrete regions of the
brain 3'5'7.  xxxg353xxx  receptors are characterized by a relatively high affinity for sulfated and non-sulfated cck-8,
cck-4 and gastrin-i 7'2°. on the other hand, cckoa

receptors have a high affinity only for sulfated forms of
cck ~.
it is becoming increasingly evident that neuropeptides, directly or indirectly, modulate the actions of
glutamate. for example, d y n o r p h i n ( l - 1 3 ) w a s reported
to inhibit glutamate binding to n-methyl-o-aspartate
( n m d a ) receptors which are a subtype of glutamate
receptors 6. moreover, it was found that neuropeptide
y potentiates the n m d a action, and that  xxxg2328xxx  prevents glutamate-induced
neuronal cell death 35'4°.
we have recently found that cck-8 and its potent
analogue,  xxxd464xxx , can significantly prevent neuronal
cell death induced by exposure of rat cultured neurons
to e:,~cess concentrations of glutamate 25. considerable
increment of the influx of extracellular ca 2+ into neurons induced by glutamate has been demonstrated to

be intimately involved in the neurodegeneration induced by glutamate, because the removal of extracelluiar ca2+ can prevent glutamate-induced neuroaal cell
death in cultured neurons9j°'28. in addition, the glutamate-induced neurotoxicity could be influenced by
other excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters which
affect ca2+ influx pathways and intracellular free calcium concentrations ([ca2+]i) in neuronal cells 26'29'3°.
therefore, we postulated that attenuating the increment of [ca2+]i induced by glutamate might be part of
the mechanism by which cck-8 and  xxxd464xxx  exert
the protective action against neurodegeneration caused
by glutamate. to address this possibility, the present
study was conducted to investigate the effect of cck-8
and  xxxd464xxx  on the increases in [ca2+]i induced by
glutamate in primary rat neuron cultures.
materials and methods
preparation of neuron and astrocyte cultures
rat neuron cultures were prepared from whole brain without
cerebellum and brainstem of 19-day-old wistar rat embryos as described previously 24. briefly, the whole brain was removed aseptically, and the cerebellum and brainstem were put away. the brain
cells were then dissociated from the tissue using 0.15% trypsin (type
i!!, sigma) and deoxyribonuclease i! (dnase i!, 10/zg/ml, sigma) in
isotonic buffer at 37°c. the cells were plated on poly-l-lysine
(sigma)-coated glass coverslip (matsunami) with a silicon rubber wall
(heraeus, flexiperm) at a density of 5 × 10t' cells/cm 2. the culture
was maintained with dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (dmem)
supplemented with 10% horse serum, 2.5% fetal calf serum and 1%
antibiotic-antimycotic (100 u/ml, penicillin (3 sodium: 100 ,¢g/ml,
streptomycin sulfate: 0.25/zg/ml,  xxxd164xxx , sigma) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% co2/95% air at 37°c.
in the present study, brain cells were not treated with cytosine
arabinoside which inhibits proliferation of non-neuronal cells, because numerous neuronal cells, which become tightly attached to
coverslips in the presence of glial cells, were required to measure
[ca 2+ ], by means of a fluorescent ca 2+ indicator.
astrocyte cultures were prepared from brain cell cultures grown
for 6 days as described u. the cultured cells were dissociated with
0.15% trypsin and dnase ii (10/zg/ml) at 37°c for 5 min. the cells
were suspended after addition of the same volume of culture medium
containing serum, and washed twice with the same medium. after
that, the cells were inoculated on a poly-l-lysine-precoated glass
coverslip at a density of 5 x 10° cells/cm 2. at this time, the neuronal
cells had completely differentiated and could not adhere to the
coverslip. these cells were used 3 days after preparation.
/ca 2 +]~ measurements
fura-2 loading of cells was performed according to the methods
of yuzaki et al. with minor modification 47. the culture medium was
replaced with hank's  xxxd2988xxx  (hbss in ram: naci
137, kci 5.4, caci 2 1.3, mgso 4 0.8, dextrose 5.6, nahco~ 4.2,
nazhpo 4 0.33, kh2po 4 0.44) containing 0.25% bsa. fura-2/am
(dojin) in dmso was then added to the medium at the final
concentration of 5 pm. the cells were incubated for 30-60 min at
37°c. prior to [ca 2+ ]i measurement, the culture was washed twice
with hbss containing 0.25% bsa. next, the cells cultured on the
glass coverslip were placed into a cuvette of the fluorometer (caf.
100 calcium analyzer, jasco). violet emission fluorescence (500
nm) intensity was obtained with excitation at either 340 nm or 380
nm at 37°c, and the ratio of fluorescence intensity between 340 nm
excitation and 380 nm excitation and the fluorescence intensity of
380 nm excitation was recorded. [ca 2+ ]i was calculated as described

by grynkiewicz et al. using apparent calcium dissociation constant
value of 224 nm 15.
drugs
cck-8, fastrin-i and cck-4 were purchased from peptide institute inc. nmda, glutamate sodium and kainate were purchased
from wako pure chemical industries ltd.  xxxd464xxx , ( - )l-364,718
and ( +)l-365,260 were synthesized in our research laboratories.
statistical analysis
statistical analysis of the results was performed using duncan's
new multiple range test after analysis of variance. each value represents mean :t: s.e.m. p < 0.05 was considered significant.

results
in neuron cultures loaded with fura-2, basal [ca2+] i
was 36 + 2 nm (n - 101), which coincides well h,'ith the
findings of previous papers and indicates that the normal synaptic activity did not produce abnormal alterations in [ca2+]it,47. ccko8 itself at concentrations of
10 .6 and 10 .5 m did not alter [ca2+]i in the rat
neuron cultures (data not shown).
glutamate (10 -5 m) induced rapid increases in
[ca2+]i of which high plateau levels were sustained
during 2-rain application (fig. 1). this concentration of
glutamate had no toxic action in neuron cultures.
therefore, glutamate was repeatedly applied to cultured neurons to compare the second response to
concomitant application of peptides and glutamate with
the first response to glutamate alone. after the glutamate-containing medium was replaced with normal

hbss containing 0.25% bsa, the increased [ca2+]i
was reduced to the resting level within 3 min. successive application of glutamate at 3-min intervals induced
reproducible increases in [ca2+]i with the same peak
amplitude as the first application of glutamate (fig.
la). removal of extracellular ca 2+ abolished the
greater part of the glutamate-induced rise i n [ca2+]i
(data not shown). when cck-8 (10 -6 m) was applied
just before the second application of glutamate, the
elevation of [ca2+]i was significantly suppressed (fig.
lb). the suppressive effect was observed for at least 5
min after removal of cck-8 (fig. lb).  xxxd464xxx  also
markedly reduced the [ca2+]i response to glutamate to
an extent similar to that of cck-8 (fig. lc). as shown
in fig. 2, cck-8 and  xxxd464xxx , in a concentration-dependent manner, significantly suppressed the increment of [ca2+]i induced by glutamate the minimum
effective concentration of both peptides was 10 -9 m.
to characterize which subtype of cck receptors,
i.e.,  xxxg352xxx  and  xxxg353xxx  receptors, mediates the suppressive effect of cck-8 on the increases in [ca2+]i
induced by glutamate, cck receptor agonists and antagonists were examined.  xxxg353xxx  receptor agonists,
gastrin-i (10 -6 m) and cck-4 (10 -6 m) also significantly suppressed the glutamate-induced rises in [ c a 2 + ]i
(table i). moreover, the selective  xxxg353xxx  receptor
antagonist, (+)l-365,260 (10 -5 m), which was applied
1 min prior to the application of cck-8 (10 -6 m),
completely abolished the suppressive effect of cck-8
on the glutamate-induced [ca2+]i response (table i).
t h e [ca2+]i response to the second application of
glutamate was similar to the first application. on the
other hand, even in the presence of selective  xxxg352xxx

duce the glutamate-induced increases in [ca2+]i (table
i).
the effect of cck-8 on glutamate-induced increases
in [ca2+]i was also examined with cultured astrocytes,
because the neuron cultures used in the present study
contained glial cells to enable the neuronal cells to
become tightly attached to the coverslips. in astrocyte
cultures, glutamate (10 -5 m) increased [ca2+]i t o a
lesser extent than that observed in neuron cultures.
cck-8 (10 -6 m) failed to suppress t h e [ca2+]i response to glutamate in astrocyte cultures (data not
shown).
in order to elucidate possible mechanisms of the
inhibitory effect of cck-8 on glutamate-induced rises
in [ca2+]i, the effect of cck-8 on the increment of
[ca2+]i in response to nmda, kainate and high concentrations of extracellular k + ([k +]o) was examined.
nmda (10 -5 m) induced approximately 7-hold higher
increases in [ca2+]i than the basal levels in mg2+-free
hbss containing glycine (10 -6 m) which is apparently
necessary for nmda receptor channel opening. however, cck-8 (10 -6 m) did not reduce the [ca2+]i
response to nmda (table ii). on the other hand,

in response to kainate (10 -5 m) (table !i). to evaluate
the effect of cck-8 on ca 2+ influx through voltage-dependent ca e+ channels, the effect of cck-8 on high
[k+]o-induced increases in [ca2+]i was examined.
cck-8 significantly reduced high [k+]o-induced increases in [ca2+]i by approximately 20% (table ii).
discussion
in the present study, we demonstrated that cck-8
and  xxxd464xxx  can significantly suppress the glutamate-induced rises in [ca2+]~ in rat primary neuron
cultures. gastrin-i and cck-4 also attenuated the
[ca2+]i in response to glutamate. since the selective
non-peptide antagonists for  xxxg352xxx  and  xxxg353xxx  receptors have been developed and characterized, evidence
has been increasing for the involvement of subtypes of
cck receptors in cck actions 37'44'45. according to
numerous studies using antagonists of cck receptors,
 xxxg353xxx  receptors, which are especially distributed in
the brain, have relatively high affinity for both sulfated
and non-sulfated forms of cck 7'2°. on the other hand,
 xxxg352xxx  receptors have been demonstrated to only have
high affinity for the sulfated form of cck and to be
mainly present in peripheral organs as well as discrete
brain areas, such as the interpeduncular nucleus, the
area postrema and the nucleus tractus solitarius 3's's.
based on this background information, the present
results suggest the involvement of  xxxg353xxx  receptors in
the suppressive effect of cck-8 and its related peptides on the [ca2+]~ response to glutamate. indeed, the
antagonist for  xxxg353xxx  receptors, but not for  xxxg352xxx 
receptors, completely abolished the suppressive effect
of cck-8 on the increment of [ca2+]i induced by
glutamate.
in recent years, evidence along several lines has
indicated that excessive release of glutamate in the
brain may play a role in neuronal damage associated
with certain insults, including hypoxia-ischemia, hypoglycemia, epilepsy and trauma a3. using brain slices and
cultured neurons, exposure to excessive concentrations
of glutamate or nmda has been shown to induce the
protractive elevation of [ca2+]~ by an influx of extracellular ca 2* with subsequent neuronal cell death '~'m'2s.
thus, in recent years, considerable attention has been
focused on the possibility that the uncontrolled, sustained elevation of cytosolic free ca 2+ levels, which
occurs as a consequence of persistent abusive receptor
stimulation by glutamate released during and following
cerebral ischemia4.12,33,41,43.
we have recently reported that cck-8 and its related peptides, such as  xxxd464xxx , gastrin-i and cck-4,
via  xxxg353xxx  receptors, can significantly prevent the neu-

ronal cell death induced by exposure of rat neuron
cultures to excessive concentrations of glutamate 25. the
potency of cck-8 and its related peptides in the
protective action against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in our previous study is in good correlation with
that of these peptides for suppressive effect on the
~,l,,camate-induced increment of [ca2+]i25. therefore,
the present findings may, in part, be applied for a
reason for the protective action of cck-8 and its
related peptides against neurodegeneration induced by
glutamate.
although the pathway of ca 2+ influx activated by
glutamate have not yet been precisely defined, the
ca2+-permeable channel highly coupled to nmda receptors and voltage-dependent ca 2+ channels arc postulated to be the principal routes of ca 2+ entry caused
by glutamate in neuronal cells 3~. in this study, cck-8
could reduce [ca 2+]i responses to kainate, while cck-8
failed to reduce the increases in [ca2+]i induced by
nmda. mg 2+, w~ich was present in the medium in
the present study as well as in our previous study, is
known to be able to block nmda actions 2'32. therefore, most part of glutamate action observed in this
experiment may be mediated by non-nmda receptors.
these findings provide the possibility that the inhibitory effect of cck-8 on kainate response may
account for the suppressive effect of cck-8 on glutamate-induced [ca2+]i responses. kainate-induced increases in [ca2+]i are generally believed to be the
result of cell depolarization induced by kainate and the
subsequent influx of ca 2+ through voltage-dependent
ca 2+ channels 31. however, recent studies revealed that
some kainate receptors produced ca 2+ entry direct
through its own ca2+-permeable channels ~7,36.to evaluate the effect of cck-8 on ca 2+ influx through
dihydropyridine-sensitive voltage-dependent c a 2+
channels, we also examined the effect of cck-8 on the
[ca2+]i response induced by high concentrations of
kc! (50 ram). although, cck-8 significantly reduced
the high [k+]o-induced rises in [ca2+]i in rat neuron
cultures as observed in snail neurons, in which cck-8
reduces the amplitude and duration of the inward
current through suppression of voltage-dependent ca 2+
channels via activation of pkc 16, the effect might be
too small to explain the inhibitory effect of cck-8 on
glutamate-induced increases in [ca2+]i. we have already found that cck-8 and  xxxd464xxx  do not influence the glutamate binding based on radioreceptor
assay using brain membrane preparation and experiments on the uptake of glutamate (data not shown).
from these findings, cck-8 and  xxxd464xxx  may influence the intracellular cascade of glutamate-induced
postreceptor events that leads to increases in [ca2+]i .

227

the activation and subsequent down-regulation of protein kinase c (pkc) was found to inhibit both ca 2+
entry and neuronal damage induced by glutamate in
cultured cerebral neurons 13. it is conceivable that
cck-8 and  xxxd464xxx  attenuate the increment of
[ca2+ ]i in response to glutamate via activation of pkc.
in rat neuron cultures, we recently found that cck-8
stimulates diacylglycerol formation which stimulates
pkc activity (data not shown).
na +/ca 2+ exchanger is thought to have a important
role in ca 2+ homeostasis in excitable cells such as
neurons, and its direction is depend on the gradient of
na + concentrations across the cell membrane m~'34'38.
the transport processes have also been postulated as a
possible source for the rises in [ca2+]i during early
ischemia or metabotropic inhibition in perfused heart 42.
the [ca2+]i increases in neurons exposed to glutamate
might also be mediated by the na+/ca 2+ exchanger,
because glutamate increases the intracellular na + concentrations directly through its own channels and causes
depolarization 34. although it has not been verified yet,
the involvement of pkc in regulation of the exchanger
has also been suggested tm.
in the present study, although the mechanism responsible for the inhibitory effect of cck-8 could not
be precisely defined, cck-8 and its potent analogue,
 xxxd464xxx , significantly attenuated glutamate-induced
increases in [ca2+]t via  xxxg353xxx  receptors in rat neuron
cultures. thus, the inhibitory effect of cck-8 and
 xxxd464xxx  on glutamate-induced rises in [ca2+]i may
provide a possible mechanism for the protective effect
against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. further studies should be undertaken to gain insight into characterization of the mechanisms of the inhibitory effect of
cck-8 and its related peptides on glutamate-induced
rises in [ca2+]~ and its relation to protective action of
these peptides against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity.
