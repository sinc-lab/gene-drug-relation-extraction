hpma copolymer- xxxd147xxx  conjugates inhibit aromatase in mcf-7 cell lines.  n-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (hpma) copolymer-doxorubicin (dox) has already shown clinical activity in breast cancer patients. moreover, we have recently found that an hpma conjugate containing a combination of both dox and the aromatase inhibitor  xxxd147xxx  (agm) shows significantly increased anti-tumour activity in vitro. to better understand the mechanism of action of hpma copolymer-agm conjugates several models were used here to investigate their effect on cell growth and aromatase inhibition. cytotoxicity of hpma copolymer conjugates containing agm, dox and also the combination agm-dox was determined by mtt assay in mcf-7 and mcf-7ca cells. androstenedione (5 x 10(- 8) m) stimulates the growth of mcf-7ca cells. both free agm and polymer-bound agm (0.2-0.4 mg/ml) were shown to block this mitogenic activity. when mcf-7ca cells were incubated [(3)h]androstenedione both agm and hpma copolymer-gflg-agm (0.2 mg/ml agm-equiv.) showed the ability to inhibit aromatase. although, free agm was able to inhibit isolated human placental microsomal aromatase in a concentration dependent manner, polymer-bound agm was not, suggesting that drug release is essential for activity of the conjugate. hpma copolymer conjugates containing aromatase inhibitors have potential for the treatment of hormone-dependant cancers, and it would be particularly interesting to explore further as potential therapies in post-menopausal women as components of combination therapy.
