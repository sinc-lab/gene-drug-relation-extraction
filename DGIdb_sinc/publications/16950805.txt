spontaneous and radiation-induced micronuclei in human lymphocytes

 xxxd2146xxx  plays a key role in the maintenance of genomic
stability, providing methyl groups for the conversion
of uracil to thymine and for dna methylation. besides
dietary habits,  xxxd2146xxx  metabolism is influenced by
genetic polymorphism. the c677t polymorphism of the
methylene- xxxd3334xxx  reductase ( xxxg1475xxx ) gene is
associated with a reduction of catalytic activity and is suggested to modify cancer risk differently depending on folate
status. in this work the effect of  xxxd2146xxx  deficiency on
genome stability and radiosensitivity has been investigated
in cultured lymphocytes of 12 subjects with different
 xxxg1475xxx  genotype (four for each genotype). cells were
grown for 9 days with 12, 24 and 120 nm  xxxd2146xxx  and
analyzed in a comprehensive micronucleus test coupled
with centromere characterization by crest immunostaining. in other experiments, cells were grown with various
 xxxd2146xxx  concentrations, irradiated with 0.5 gy of gamma
rays and analyzed in the micronucleus test. the results
obtained indicate that  xxxd2146xxx  deficiency induces to a
comparable extent chromosome loss and breakage, irrespective of the  xxxg1475xxx  genotype. the effect of  xxxd2146xxx 
was highly significant (p < 0.001) and explained >50% of
variance of both types of micronuclei. also nucleoplasmic
bridges and buds were significantly increased under low
folate supply; the increase in bridges was mainly observed
in tt cells, highlighting a significant effect of the  xxxg1475xxx 
genotype (p 5 0.006) on this biomarker.  xxxd2146xxx  concentration significantly affected radiation-induced micronuclei
(p < 0.001): the increased incidence of radiation-induced
micronuclei with low  xxxd2146xxx  was mainly accounted for by
carriers of the variant  xxxg1475xxx  allele (both homozygotes
and heterozygotes), but the overall effect of genotype did
not attain statistical significance. treatment with ionizing
radiations also increased the frequency of nucleoplasmic
bridges. the effect of  xxxd2146xxx  level on this end-point was
modulated by the  xxxg1475xxx  genotype (p for interaction 5
0.02), with tt cells grown at low  xxxd2146xxx  concentration
apparently resistant to the induction of radiation-induced
bridges. finally, the effect of in vitro folate deprivation on
global dna methylation was evaluated in lymphocytes of
six homozygous subjects (three cc and three tt). the
results obtained suggest that, under the conditions of this
work,  xxxd2146xxx  deprivation is associated with global dna
hypermethylation.

 xxxd2146xxx  metabolism plays an important role in the maintenance of genomic stability, providing methyl groups for the
conversion of uracil to thymine and for the synthesis of
 xxxd3156xxx , required for physiological dna
methylation in mammals (1,2). a growing body of evidence
suggests that a deficient supply of dietary  xxxd2146xxx  may be a
risk factor for several human diseases, including neonatal malformations, down syndrome,  xxxg178xxx , cardiovascular disorders and cancer (3–5). in vitro studies on human cells
show that low levels of serum folate are associated with misincorporation of uracil into dna and dna damage (6–8), as
well as with aneuploidy of chromosomes involved in tumors
and other diseases associated with folate deficiency (9,10).
as mammals are unable to synthesize  xxxd2146xxx  de novo,
serum levels of this micronutrient are mainly modulated by
dietary habits (11). another source of variability in folate
metabolism is represented by the polymorphism of genes
implicated in relevant biochemical pathways. among these, a
prominent role is played by methylene- xxxd3334xxx  reductase ( xxxg1475xxx ), which catalyzes the conversion of 5,10methylene- xxxd3334xxx  into 5-methyl- xxxd3334xxx ,
the precursor for methylation of homocysteine to methionine.
the c677t polymorphism in  xxxg1475xxx  determines an alanine to
valine substitution, with a significant reduction of catalytic
activity (12).
epidemiological studies indicate that the  xxxg1475xxx  tt genotype is associated with a lower risk of acute lymphocytic
leukemia (13,14) and colon carcinoma (15), especially in subjects with low-risk diet high in folate (16,17). this protective
effect has been related to the diversion of  xxxd2146xxx  to thymidine synthesis under suboptimal  xxxg1475xxx  activity, with consequent lower misincorporation of uracil into dna (17,18). on
the other hand, in conditions of  xxxd2146xxx  deficiency the
 xxxg1475xxx  variant genotype has been shown to be associated
with an increased risk of developmental defects in utero and
cancer at various sites (colon, breast, gastric, cervical and
prostate) (19–23).
the mechanism by which low folate status and  xxxg1475xxx 
deficiency interact raising the risk of tumors and misconception
is not known. previous studies on cultured human lymphocytes
did not highlight a significant influence of the c677t polymorphisms on genomic instability induced by variation of folic
acid concentration within the physiological range (12–120 nm)
(24,25). however, it was suggested that the high riboflavin
content of the culture medium used in these studies could
have improved  xxxg1475xxx  activity above normal level, masking
the functional consequences of the polymorphism (25). in any
case, whether the  xxxg1475xxx /folate status may modulate dna
repair capacity and the individual susceptibility to induced
genotoxic effects has not been elucidated.

introduction

p.leopardi et al.

materials and methods
study subjects
study subjects were selected from a cohort of healthy non-smoker female
donors in collaboration with the institute of haematology of rome university
‘la sapienza’. four age-matched subjects for each genotype were enrolled in
the study. the average age of the study group was 32 years (sd 6). all subjects
gave an informed consent to their participation in the study.
 xxxg1475xxx  genotyping
genomic dna was isolated from whole blood samples using instagene matrix
(biorad) according to manufacturer’s instructions. the  xxxg1475xxx  c677t mutation was detected after pcr amplification with the appropriate primers (27).
the variant allele was identified by the presence of a 175 bp fragment after
digestion with hinfi that leaves uncut the 198 bp wild-type fragment.
lymphocyte cultures
from each subject a blood specimen (7 ml) was collected by venipuncture in
vacutainers containing  xxxd2267xxx   xxxd3214xxx  as anticoagulant (becton dickinson).
lymphocytes were isolated using histopaque-1077 gradients (sigma) and
placed in culture medium without  xxxd2146xxx , with l-glutamine and phenol red
(rpmi 1640; gibco) added with 25 ml/ml of 1 m hepes buffer solution
(euroclone), 1% penicillin (5000 u/ml) and streptomycin (5000 mg/ml) solution (flow), 10% inactivated fetal calf serum (fcs; euroclone), 0.5% phytohaemagglutinin ha15 (murex), 10 u/ml interleukin-2 (roche diagnostic),
9 ml/ml sodium pyruvate 100 mm (euroclone). three  xxxd2146xxx  (sigma)
concentrations, 120, 24 and 12 nm, were selected on the basis of literature
data (24,25). triplicate 2 ml cultures, with 1 3 105 lymphocytes/ml, were set
up in 15 ml conical tubes (falcon) and incubated at 37 c and in a humidified
5% co2 incubator for 9 days. culture medium was changed at the 3rd and 6th
culture day, according to a published experimental protocol (24,25). eight days
after phytohaemagglutinin addition, each culture was split in two 1 ml aliquots,
providing a total of six tubes per dose for each subject. four cultures were used
for cytogenetic analyses and immunostaining with anti-kinetochore antibody,
two cultures were used for the gamma rays sensitivity test.
cytokinesis block micronucleus assay
cytochalasin b 4.5 mg/ml (sigma) was added to cultures used for cytogenetic
analyses on the 8th day of culture. after 28 h cells were spun onto microscope
slides using a cytocentrifuge (shandon). smears were air-dried, fixed 10 minutes in methanol and stained in 4% giemsa phosphate buffer. cells were
analyzed in the comprehensive micronucleus test following the criteria set up
by fenech (26). the frequencies of binucleated cells with micronuclei
(mnbin), total micronuclei (mntot), buds and nucleoplasmic bridges
(npbs) were determined analyzing 1000 binucleate lymphocytes with a wellpreserved cytoplasm from two slides. the nuclear division index (ndi), a cell
proliferation index, was determined in 1000 cells according to eastmond and
tucker (28): [mononucleated cells 1 (23 binucleated cells) 1 (33 trinucleated cells) 1 (43 tetranucleated cells)]/1000.
immunostaining with crest antibody
cytocentrifuge slides processed by crest antibody immunofluorescence
technique were blocked in kcm buffer [120 mm kcl, 20 mm nacl, 10 mm

328

tris–hcl (ph 8), 0.5 m edta, 0.1% triton x-100] for 10 min at room
temperature. after a gentle wash in 13 phosphate-buffered saline (pbs),
50 ml of anti-kinetochore antibody solution (antibodies incorporated, davies,
ca), diluted 1:1 in 13 pbs, was placed on each smear with a coverslip for 1 h at
37 c in a humidified box. after two 3 min washes in 43 ssc/0.05%
tween-20, and a 6 min passage in pn buffer [0.1 m nah2po4, 0.1 m
na2hpo4; 0.1% np-40 (sigma), ph 8.0] added with 5% non-fat dry milk
(pnm), a 50 ml aliquot of fitc goat anti- xxxd2207xxx  (chemicon international,
ca), previously diluted 1:60 in pnm, was applied on each slide and incubated
for 1 h at 37 c in a humidified box. slides were counterstained with  xxxd3027xxx 
iodide (2.5 mg/ml) in antifade (vector laboratories, ca) and observed by
fluorescence microscopy. labeled slides were used immediately or stored in
the dark at 4 c. one hundred micronuclei per  xxxd2146xxx  concentration per
donor were immunocharacterized. based on the number of immunofluorescence signals micronuclei were classified as crest-negative (no signal) and
crest-positive with 1, 2 or >2 signals.
treatments with gamma rays
to test gamma rays sensitivity, lymphocyte cultures were irradiated at day 8
with 0.5 gy from a 137cs source at a dose rate of 1 gy/min. after irradiation,
lymphocytes were centrifuged, medium replaced and cyt-b was added at the
final concentration of 4.5 mg/ml. cells were harvested 28 h later using a
cytocentrifuge. for each experimental point micronuclei, nucleoplasmic
bridges and buds were scored in 1000 binucleated cells from two slides.
baseline levels in unirradiated cells were subtracted to calculate
radiation-induced chromosome damage for further statistical analysis.
dna methylation
dna methylation was determined using a published method based on the
incorporation of [3h]methyl groups by a bacterial cpg methylase in genomic
dna (29). in this assay the ability of dna to incorporate [3h]methyl groups
in vitro is inversely related to endogenous methylation. briefly, dna (0.5 mg/
sample) was incubated with [3h]methyl s- xxxd3156xxx  in the presence
of the prokaryotic cpg methylase sssi (new england biolabs), methylated
dna isolated on ion-exchange paper filter and analyzed in a liquid scintillation
counter. incubation conditions and processing of samples followed the original
published procedure (30).
statistical analysis of data
all data were log transformed before statistical analysis. means of groups with
different genotype were compared by two-tailed student’s t-test; mean values
of each group at different  xxxd2146xxx  concentrations were compared using the
matched-pair student’s t-test. the effect of  xxxd2146xxx  concentration on genetic
biomarkers in the study population (on combined data from all subjects) was
evaluated by repeated-measures one-way analysis of variance (anova). twoway anova was used to analyze the effect of  xxxd2146xxx  concentration and
genotype and their interaction, and the total variation attributable to these
factors. pearson correlation was used to test the interrelationships among
biomarkers of dna damage. all analyses were performed with the spss
statistical package (version 11.0).

results
cytokinesis block micronucleus assay
lowering  xxxd2146xxx  concentration in culture medium significantly increased the frequency of binucleated cells with
micronuclei (mnbin) and total micronuclei (mntot) in
cytokinesis-blocked lymphocytes of all donors (table i). the
effect of  xxxd2146xxx  was highly significant (p < 0.001) and
accounted for 74 and 72% of total variance of mnbin and
mntot, respectively. at the dose 24 nm, a significantly (p <
0.05) higher incidence of mnbin and mntot was observed in
tt cells compared with both cc homozygotes and ct heterozygotes. however, no significant difference among  xxxg1475xxx 
genotypes was observed at the lower  xxxd2146xxx  concentration.
overall, the effect of the  xxxg1475xxx  genotype on the incidence of
micronuclei was not significant.
the overall incidence of nucleoplasmic bridges was significantly increased in cells grown with low  xxxd2146xxx  supply
(p < 0.05). this increase was mainly accounted for by tt
cells, which showed significantly more nucleoplasmic bridges
compared with cc and ct cells at low folate concentrations

in this work, we have further investigated the effects of
folate deficiency on genome stability and radiosensitivity in
human lymphocytes, also in relation to the  xxxg1475xxx  c677t
polymorphism. to this aim, peripheral lymphocytes of donors
with different  xxxg1475xxx  genotype were grown in the presence of
various  xxxd2146xxx  concentrations and analyzed in a comprehensive micronucleus test, including the analysis of nucleoplasmic
bridges (npbs), as biomarkers of chromosome rearrangements, and nuclear buds (nbuds) as biomarkers of gene amplification (26). in order to get insights on the mechanism
responsible for micronucleus formation, micronuclei were
characterized for centromere content by immunostaining with
crest antibody. the degree of genomic dna methylation
was evaluated as well. moreover, the sensitivity to ionizing
radiation in conditions of  xxxd2146xxx  deficiency was assessed
after in vitro irradiation with gamma rays, in order to probe the
combined effect of folate deficiency and  xxxg1475xxx  genotype on
dna repair proficiency.

 xxxd2146xxx  deficiency and genome stability

(p < 0.01). both  xxxd2146xxx  and the  xxxg1475xxx  genotype significantly affected npbs (p 5 0.002 and 0.006), explaining,
respectively, 14 and 39% of the variation in the incidence of
the biomarker.
also nuclear buds were significantly increased at low folic
acid concentrations. the effect of  xxxd2146xxx  was highly significant (p < 0.001) and explained 38% of total variance. at low
 xxxd2146xxx  concentrations tt cells displayed slightly higher bud
levels compared with cc and ct cells, but the difference did
not attain statistical significance nor did the interaction
between  xxxd2146xxx  and genotype (p 5 0.089).
the comparison of ndi values indicated that  xxxd2146xxx 
deprivation significantly affected the growth of cultured

characterization of micronuclei by crest immunostaining
for each experimental point, one hundred micronuclei were
characterized for the content of kinetochore by crest
immunostaining. the results are summarized in table ii. a
general prevalence of crest-positive micronuclei (mn1)
was observed at all  xxxd2146xxx  concentrations, with no striking
differences among genotypes. only at the concentration 24
nm, a significant difference in the proportion of crestpositive and crest-negative micronuclei was observed
between tt and cc subjects (p < 0.05); however, this observation was not confirmed at the lower  xxxd2146xxx  concentration
(12 nm), where a similar proportions of mn crest-positive
and crest-negative were observed.
based on the total number of micronuclei detected (mntot,
as shown in table i) and the results of crest hybridization
(table ii), the incidence of mn1 and mn induced by folic
acid deprivation was calculated. as shown in table iii, both
crest-positive and crest-negative micronuclei were largely increased at 24 and 12 nm  xxxd2146xxx  compared with 120
nm. the effect of  xxxd2146xxx  concentration on the incidence of
both types of micronuclei was highly significant (p < 0.001),
while no significant influence of the  xxxg1475xxx  genotype was
disclosed by the statistical analysis of data.  xxxd2146xxx  concentration explained 51 and 54% of the variation of mn1 and
mn , respectively.
the interrelationships among biomarkers of genetic damage
under different  xxxd2146xxx  levels were analyzed by pearson
correlation (table iv). data highlight a significant positive
correlation between the incidence of buds and nucleoplasmic
bridges at both 12 and 24 nm  xxxd2146xxx . buds were also
significantly correlated with mntot at 24 nm, but not at the
lowest  xxxd2146xxx  concentration. no significant correlation was
observed between the incidences of the biomarkers at 120 nm
 xxxd2146xxx  and their respective frequencies at lower folate concentrations.
dna methylation
three wild-type  xxxg1475xxx  677cc and three homozygous tt
variant subjects were selected for a preliminary assessment
of the influence of  xxxd2146xxx  concentration in culture medium
on global dna methylation in cultured lymphocytes. the
results obtained are shown in figure 1. in conditions of folic
acid deficiency, a decrease in the incorporation of tritiated
methyl groups was observed in all subjects, with no significant

differences among genotypes.  xxxd2146xxx  level in culture medium explained 43% of the total variance (p < 0.001) in the
incorporation of labeled methyl groups in dna. as the acceptance of exogenous methyl groups is inversely related to the
degree of endogenous methylation, the results obtained indicate that the conditions of  xxxd2146xxx  deprivation applied in
this work are associated with global dna hypermethylation.
treatments with gamma rays
lymphocyte cultures grown under different  xxxd2146xxx  concentrations were irradiated with 0.5 gy and analyzed in the
micronucleus test. treatments could not be performed on two
subjects (one cc and one ct). the results obtained are summarized in table v. treatments induced a distinct increase of
mnbin in all cultures.  xxxd2146xxx  significantly affected the
incidence of radiation-induced micronuclei (p 5 0.003), with
relatively greater responses at 24 and 12 nm  xxxd2146xxx  compared with 120 nm. the increased susceptibility to irradiation
associated with  xxxd2146xxx  deficiency was mainly accounted for
by the greater response observed in tt and ct cells. at 12 nm
 xxxd2146xxx , the incidence of induced micronuclei was significantly higher in ct cells compared with cc wild types (p <
0.05), whereas the difference between tt and cc was not
statistically significant (p 5 0.3).  xxxd2146xxx  levels explained
24% of the variation in the incidence of radiation-induced
micronuclei, whereas the influence of genotype  xxxg1475xxx  was
not significant.

 xxxd2146xxx  (compare with data in table i). in cc cells, the
frequency of npbs induced by irradiation was slightly higher
at low  xxxd2146xxx  concentrations, even though the difference
with 120 nm did not attain statistical significance. on the other
hand, tt cells grown with 12 nm  xxxd2146xxx  were apparently
resistant to the induction of npbs by irradiation, showing
significantly less induced npbs than at 120 nm (p 5 0.006),
and significantly less induced npb than cc cells at 12 nm folic
acid (p 5 0.009). the interaction of genotype and  xxxd2146xxx 
affecting npb levels was statistically significant (p 5 0.02).
no consistent effect of irradiation on nuclear buds was detected
(data not shown); therefore, data on buds in irradiated cells
were not further analyzed. finally, the ndi of irradiated cultures was generally lower compared with unirradiated cultures
(as shown in table i) and was not significantly affected by folic
acid levels or  xxxg1475xxx  genotype.
discussion
epidemiological investigations indicate that the risk of birth
defects and cancers associated with  xxxd2146xxx  deficiency is
modulated by the  xxxg1475xxx  c677t polymorphism (31–33).
the mechanism underlying the interaction between dietary
supply of  xxxd2146xxx  and  xxxg1475xxx  polymorphism is not elucidated. in fact, while the role of  xxxd2146xxx  in the maintenance of
genomic stability is well established, the function of the
 xxxg1475xxx  polymorphism is less clearly defined. on one hand,
the lower methylene- xxxd3334xxx  reductase activity associated with the  xxxg1475xxx  variant allele can make available more

5,10-methylene- xxxd3334xxx  for the conversion of uracil to
thymidine, minimizing uracil misincorporation in dna. on the
other hand, under conditions of severe  xxxd2146xxx  deficiency
other pathways of folate metabolism, e.g. the maintenance of
dna methylation, may get a prominent role, and the functional
consequences of the c677t polymorphism may be different.
the interaction between  xxxg1475xxx  c677t polymorphism and
 xxxd2146xxx  deficiency was the object of previous in vitro studies
with human lymphocytes cultured with low concentrations of
 xxxd2146xxx . the results obtained in these studies, using a culture
medium with high riboflavin and methionine content, did not
highlight a major effect of these polymorphisms on uracil
misincorporation (25) and dna damage induced by folic
acid deficiency (24). however, a possible interaction was suggested in a later study with culture medium containing lower
physiological concentrations of riboflavine and methionine in
which lower incidences of nuclear buds were observed in tt
cells compared with cc cells under low  xxxd2146xxx  supply (34).
in this work the genetic effects of folate deficiency in relation to the  xxxg1475xxx  c677t polymorphism has been further
investigated in a comprehensive micronucleus test coupled
with centromere detection and in challenge assays with
gamma rays. overall, the results of micronucleus assays confirmed the effect of  xxxd2146xxx  deficiency on genome stability
observed in previous studies. the crest analysis of induced
micronuclei performed in this work demonstrated the induction
of both kinetochore-positive and kinetochore-negative
micronuclei in conditions of  xxxd2146xxx  deficiency. this result
implies the simultaneous impairment of chromosome integrity
and segregation in cells grown with an insufficient  xxxd2146xxx

supply. the aneugenic effect of folate deficiency in human
lymphocytes and in a lymphoblastoid cell line was described
in recent studies in which the malsegregation of specific chromosomes was investigated (9,10). herewith we provide a measurement of the overall aneugenic effect of  xxxd2146xxx 
deficiency, affecting all chromosomes, which allows a direct
comparison with the clastogenic potential exerted in the same
experimental conditions. based on the results presented it can
be concluded that, in the experimental conditions of this work,
 xxxd2146xxx  deficiency affected to the same extent chromosome
integrity and segregation.
a preliminary assessment of the influence of the  xxxg1475xxx 
c677t polymorphisms on the studied end-points was also
undertaken. the results obtained should be interpreted with
caution, bearing in mind the relatively small number of subjects analyzed, and the high riboflavin content of culture medium, which may have lowered the phenotypic expression of the
polymorphism (34,35). anyway, no clear modifying effect of
the c677t polymorphism on micronucleus induction or centromere content was observed. on the other hand, a significant
influence of the  xxxg1475xxx  genotype on nucleoplasmic bridges
was detected. despite the small number of subjects, the prevalence of bridges in tt cells with low  xxxd2146xxx  was clearcut,
suggesting a true modifying effect of the c677t polymorphism
and confirming similar findings reported by others (34).
the different modifying effect of the  xxxg1475xxx  c677t polymorphism on various cytogenetic markers may indicate that
under  xxxd2146xxx  deprivation micronuclei and bridges arise
through different mechanisms. crest-negative micronuclei
may represent mainly chromosome breaks originating from
catastrophic repair of uracil, i.e. from the simultaneous
removal of adjacent uracils on opposite strands. as uracil is
misincorporated under folate deficiency independently on the
 xxxg1475xxx  genotype (6,18), this polymorphisms is not expected
to affect the incidence of crest-negative micronuclei. on the
other hand crest-positive micronuclei, representing chromosome loss, are mainly ascribed to altered methylation of critical
cpg sequences, e.g. in satellite dna or in the promoter of
mitotic spindle check-point genes (8–10). the influence of the
 xxxg1475xxx  genotype on dna methylation in relation to  xxxd2146xxx 
supply has not been studied in detail. however, the preliminary
evaluation of global cpg methylation performed in this study
did not highlight significant differences among  xxxg1475xxx  genotypes, showing a paradoxical hypermethylation of cpg in all
cultures at the lowest dose of  xxxd2146xxx , possibly due to the
compensatory upregulation of cpg methyltransferase (35).
indeed folate deficiency affects dna methylation in a complex
way, with site-specific hypomethylation and hypermethylation
(27), and it is conceivable that c677t could only affect the
methylation of specific target sequences. in this respect, the
demethylation of h3 histone at telomeric sequences, with chromatin remodeling and associated chromosome fusigenic potential, could be hypothesized to explain the elevated incidence of
npbs in tt cells (36,37). in fact the hypomethylation of
subtelomeric regions and associated proteins is known to lead
to telomere elongation (38), which is associated with high
incidences of end-to-end chromosome fusion and recombination (39,40), leading to chromosome rearrangements visualized
as npbs.
as far as the treatment with gamma rays is concerned, it
was recently shown that folate status is an important modifier
of the sensitivity to radiation, with higher incidences of
radiation-induced micronuclei at low folate concentrations

(10). these findings were confirmed in the present investigation. in addition, this study suggested a modifying effect of the
 xxxg1475xxx  genotype. interestingly, at the lowest  xxxd2146xxx  concentration the incidences of micronuclei and npbs in irradiated
cells showed an inverse association with the  xxxg1475xxx  genotype:
high micronuclei and low npbs in carriers of the variant allele
(ct 1 tt) and low micronuclei and high npbs in wild types.
considering that micronuclei and npbs may represent, respectively, chromosome fragments and exchanges (41), these
results may indicate that carriers of the variant allele process
radiation-induced double strand breaks with lower efficiency
compared with wild types. in fact the kinetic of
radiation-induced chromosome damage shows that chromosome breaks decrease as exchanges appear (42,43), indicating
that the latter result from the processing of primary lesions,
which, if unrepaired, will show up as micronuclei. the
impaired methylation of critical targets, such as
chromatin-associated proteins involved in repair of dna double strand breaks (44), could explain the lower efficiency in the
processing of radiation induced damage in  xxxg1475xxx  cells.
admittedly these considerations are based on limited experimental findings and are only proposed as a possible conceptual
framework for further studies, rather than as an explanation of
the results obtained.
in conclusion, the results obtained indicate that  xxxd2146xxx 
deficiency induces to a comparable extent chromosome breakage and loss in cultured human lymphocytes.  xxxd2146xxx  deficiency was also associated with an increased sensitivity to
micronucleus induction by ionizing radiation. the formation
of micronuclei was not significantly affected by the  xxxg1475xxx 
c677t polymorphism, which instead exerted a modifying
effect on nucleoplasmic bridges induced by irradiation or low
 xxxd2146xxx  supply. owing to the limited number of subjects
investigated, the possibility that other unmatched polymorphisms in folate metabolism are involved cannot be ruled out.
therefore, these findings are to be regarded as preliminary and
will need confirmation in larger studies using physiological
concentrations of relevant micronutrients.
