randomized controlled trial of  xxxd253xxx  in patients
with the myelodysplastic syndrome: a study of the cancer
and leukemia group b

purpose: patients with high-risk myelodysplastic
syndrome (mds) have high mortality from bone marrow failure or transformation to acute leukemia. supportive care is standard therapy. we previously reported that  xxxd253xxx  (aza c) was active in patients
with high-risk mds.
patients and methods: a randomized controlled trial
was undertaken in 191 patients with mds to compare
aza c (75 mg/m2/d subcutaneously for 7 days every
28 days) with supportive care. mds was defined by
french-american-british criteria. new rigorous response
criteria were applied. both arms received transfusions
and antibiotics as required. patients in the supportive care
arm whose disease worsened were permitted to cross
over to aza c.
results: responses occurred in 60% of patients on the
aza c arm (7% complete response, 16% partial response,
37% improved) compared with 5% (improved) receiving
supportive care (p < .001). median time to leukemic
transformation or death was 21 months for aza c versus

13 months for supportive care (p ⴝ .007). transformation
to acute myelogenous leukemia occurred as the first
event in 15% of patients on the aza c arm and in 38%
receiving supportive care (p ⴝ .001). eliminating the confounding effect of early cross-over to aza c, a landmark
analysis after 6 months showed median survival of an
additional 18 months for aza c and 11 months for supportive care (p ⴝ .03). quality-of-life assessment
found significant major advantages in physical function, symptoms, and psychological state for patients
initially randomized to aza c.
conclusion: aza c treatment results in significantly
higher response rates, improved quality of life, reduced
risk of leukemic transformation, and improved survival
compared with supportive care. aza c provides a new
treatment option that is superior to supportive care for
patients with the mds subtypes and specific entry criteria treated in this study.

yelodysplastic syndrome (mds) represents a
heterogeneous hematopoietic disorder in which mature blood cells are derived from an abnormal multipotent
progenitor cell. the disease is characterized by morphologic
features of dyspoiesis, a hyperproliferative bone marrow,
and peripheral-blood cytopenias involving one or more
lineages.1 refractory anemia (ra) with or without ringed
sideroblasts can persist for years, but ra with excess blasts
(raebs) or raebs in transformation to leukemia
(raeb-t) exhibit an accelerated course.2-5 most patients
with high-risk mds (ie, french-american-british [fab]
subtypes with excess blasts) die within 1 year from
progressive bone marrow failure attributable to hemorrhage or infection. in 35% to 40% of patients, transformation to acute leukemia occurs, which is often refractory to present therapy.1
therapies tried for mds include granulocyte colonystimulating factor (g-csf),  xxxg526xxx  (gm-csf), erythropoietin, and chemotherapy.6-22 none has altered the natural history of the
disease. supportive care with antibiotics and transfusions is
considered the standard of care. allogeneic bone marrow
transplantation, a potentially curative approach, is a realistic
option for only approximately 5% of patients.23-28

 xxxd253xxx  (aza c), a pyrimidine nucleoside analog, was
developed as an antitumor agent.29-31 in addition to cytotoxic effects, it induces differentiation of malignant cells in
vitro.32-35 aza c inhibits dna methyltransferase, the enzyme in mammalian cells responsible for methylating newly

in 49% of patients with high-risk mds (raeb and raebt). a second phase ii study of 67 patients with high-risk
mds showed that aza c as a subcutaneous daily bolus
injection at the same dose and schedule on an ambulatory
basis produced comparable results in response rate, response duration, and survival.40 the present phase iii
randomized trial compares subcutaneous aza c treatment
with supportive care.
patients and methods

patient selection
all patients fulfilled the fab classification criteria for mds.41-43
patients with ra or ra with ringed sideroblasts (rars) met additional criteria of significant marrow dysfunction (table 1). bone
marrow aspiration and biopsy were required within the 2 weeks before
registration. peripheral-blood films and marrow specimens were independently evaluated through centralized pathology review (d.n.).
patients with therapy-related mds were eligible if they were
cancer-free for at least 3 years and had not received radiation or
chemotherapy for 6 months. additional eligibility requirements are
listed in table 2. the protocol was approved by the institutional review
boards of all participating institutions. each patient provided written
informed consent.

treatment regimen
patients were stratified by fab subtype and randomly assigned to
supportive care or aza c. the use of all hematopoietic growth factors
was prohibited. transfusions and antibiotics were administered as
required. marrow samples were obtained before study entry, at day 57,
and at day 113.
aza c arm. aza c (75 mg/m2/d) was injected subcutaneously in
7-day cycles beginning on days 1, 29, 57, and 85. aza c, supplied by

the national cancer institute (bethesda, md) in vials of 100 mg of
powder plus 100 mg of mannitol, was suspended in 4 ml of sterile
water and injected as a slurry with a maximum volume of 4 ml per
injection site. if a beneficial effect was not demonstrated by day 57 and
no significant toxicity other than nausea or vomiting had occurred, the
dose of aza c was increased by 33%. once benefit occurred on a
particular dosage, aza c was continued unless toxicity developed.
patients were assessed after the fourth cycle. those who achieved cr
continued on aza c for three more cycles; those with pr or improvement continued on aza c until either cr or relapse occurred.
responses were initially evaluated by the treating physician but
subsequently were scored independently by two experienced investigators (l.r.s. and r.m.s.) to validate responses. patients who progressed (see definitions, below) during the induction phase and those
with stable disease at day 113 were classified treatment failures and
removed from treatment.
supportive care arm. after a minimum interval of 4 months of
supportive care, patients whose disease was worsening (see definitions,
below) were permitted to cross over to aza c treatment. patients could exit
supportive care before 4 months but only because of death, withdrawal of
consent, transformation to acute leukemia, or a platelet count persistently
less than 20 ⫻ 109/l after week 8. patients transforming to acute
myelogenous leukemia (aml) exited at any time; those with less than or
equal to 40% blasts in the marrow crossed over to aza c, whereas those
with greater than 40% blasts received other treatments.
cross-over. all data necessary to establish eligibility for crossover from supportive care to aza c were independently reviewed by
the study chair, whose prior approval was required before cross-over (n
⫽ 46 of 49). cross-over patients were studied and treated identically to
patients initially randomized to aza c.
quality-of-life assessment. quality of life (qol), an integral component of the study, was systematically assessed during standard telephone
interviews by one of two trained nurses (e.p.d. or r.o.r.) before
randomization and on days 50, 106, and 182. the qol battery included
measures of four dimensions: physical symptoms and functioning, psychological state, social functioning, and sociodemographic characteristics.
the questionnaire consisted of two validated scales, the european organization for research and treatment of cancer (eortc) qol and the
mental health inventory (mhi). questionnaires were given or mailed to
patients before the telephone interviews; the interview methodologies have
been validated in prior calgb studies.44

§changes in blood counts secondary to drug-induced myelosuppression did not constitute criteria for relapse.

definitions
response criteria are outlined in table 3.
relapse of responders. relapse from cr was defined as greater
than 5% myeloblasts in the bone marrow. relapse from a pr was
defined as ⱖ 30% myeloblasts in the bone marrow (except for patients
with ra and rars, where peripheral-blood criteria alone or in
conjunction with the bone marrow were used). relapse for improved
patients was defined as a decline to pretreatment levels in the blood
counts, which were the criteria for response, or the recurrence of a
transfusion requirement secondary to disease progression. reversible
changes in blood counts secondary to drug-induced myelosuppression
did not constitute criteria for relapse.
treatment failure in nonresponders. treatment was considered to
have failed in nonresponders receiving supportive care if they advanced
to a higher fab subtype (ie, to raeb or raeb-t) or to aml,
remained rbc transfusion– dependent before and during study, or
developed progressive bone marrow failure, defined as the following:
(1) confirmed fall from baseline of greater than 25% in all three
peripheral-blood cell lines or greater than 50% fall in two cell lines or
a greater than 75% fall in one cell lineage or (2) development of a rbc
transfusion requirement (ie, in patients not receiving rbc transfusions
before study entry, if the hemoglobin fell to ⬍ 9 g/l in patients ⬎ 65
years of age or to ⱕ 8 g/l if ⱕ 65 years of age). supportive care
treatment was also considered to have failed if patients had a platelet
count persistently lower than 20 ⫻ 109/l after week 8 (n ⫽ 9).
nonresponders taking aza c were evaluated identically for treatment
failure, and when treatment failure was present, these patients exited
protocol study but were followed for survival.

statistical methods
four analyses, three interim and one final, were planned using
o’brien-fleming stopping rules. the first three analyses found a
significant difference in response between the arms (undisclosed
information), but the data and safety monitoring board recommended

continuation of the study so that qol, survival, and transfusion
requirements could be studied in a larger sample. twenty-six percent of
the patient records were independently audited by the calgb data
audit committee for protocol compliance and data quality.
analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. patients (n
⫽ 20) determined by central pathology review to have acute leukemia
at entry were noninformative for aml transformation and the time-totreatment failure analyses. response rates of the randomized arms were
compared with the ␹2 test of proportions. survival, time to response,
and response duration were estimated with the kaplan-meier method
and compared with the log-rank test.45,46 in testing for differences in
survival and time to transformation to aml, randomized induction
treatments were compared and cross-over was ignored. the two-stage
statistical methodology recommended by gelman et al47 was used in
analyzing the time to aml to account for the competing risk of death.
prestudy rbc transfusion requirements (present/absent) were calculated. rbc transfusion data were standardized to the number of units
per month and the means across time. differences in transfusion
requirements could have been influenced by the loss of patients because
of death, cross-over, and dropout (attrition bias) and by physician
discretion in the administration of transfusions.
times to initial response and to best response were measured from
study entry to the date that initial and best response criteria were met,
respectively. duration of response was measured from initial response
to relapse. time to treatment failure was measured from study entry to
the point of relapse (for responders) or failure (for nonresponders). the
time from study entry to transformation to aml or death was chosen
as the most meaningful clinical end point, because survival and qol
decline rapidly for patients with mds after aml develops.

qol analysis
a pattern-mixture model was used to examine treatment differences
in qol over time.48-51

results

patient characteristics
one hundred ninety-one patients with mds deemed eligible
by treating investigators were entered on calgb 9221 between february 1994 and may 1996 from 26 main member
institutions and their 30 affiliated hospitals. response and
toxicity were analyzed on data available through february
1999. after central pathology review, 20 patients were determined to have aml at study entry. these patients are excluded
only from the aml transformation and time to progression
analyses. the conclusions were unchanged if these patients
were excluded from all analyses (data not shown).
the two arms were evenly balanced at study entry (table
4). there were no differences by fab subtype, cytogenetic
analysis (n ⫽ 81), international prognostic scoring system
score,52 or time from diagnosis to study entry. hematologic
parameters at study registration are described in table 5.

analysis of response
among patients randomized to supportive care, 5% (n ⫽
5) met the criteria for improvement. no patient achieved a
cr or pr (table 6). all five patients categorized as
improved either had a rising wbc count or absolute
neutrophil count (n ⫽ 4) or platelets (n ⫽ 1) in the process
of transforming from mds to aml. on the aza c arm,
60% (n ⫽ 60) responded (p ⬍ .0001), with 7% (n ⫽ 7)
achieving cr, 16% (n ⫽ 16) having pr, and 37% (n ⫽ 37)
improving. in no case was improvement of cytopenia a
component of transformation to aml. the trilineage response was 23% for aza c and 0% for supportive care.
among the 37 aza c patients categorized as improved, 35%
had increases in all three cell lines (but insufficient to meet
criteria for pr), 30% had increases in two cell lines, and
35% had an increase in only a single cell line (fig 1).
response to aza c was independent of mds classification.

18% pr [n ⫽ 4]; 32% improved [n ⫽ 7]) were comparable
with patients with raeb, raeb-t, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (cmmol) (8% cr [n ⫽ 5], 15% pr [n ⫽ 10],
38% improved [n ⫽ 25]) among patients classified according
to central pathology review (table 4). median times to initial
response and best response were 64 and 93 days, respectively.
the median duration of response among patients who achieved
cr, pr, or improvement was 15 months (95% confidence
interval [ci], 11 to 20 months) (fig 2).
of 49 patients who crossed over from supportive care to
aza c, 47% (n ⫽ 23) then responded, with 10% (five
patients) achieving cr, 4% (two patients) having pr, and
33% (16 patients) improving. the trilineage response was
14%. neither age nor sex influenced response rates.
time to treatment failure
with certain exceptions (see above), the study design
intended that patients remain on the initial randomization
arm for a minimum of 4 months. the median time to exit
from supportive care (ie, median time to treatment failure)
was 3.8 months (95% ci, 3.5 to 4.0 months; range, 0.6 to ⬎
55 months); the median time to exit from the aza c arm was
9.1 months (95% ci, 5.6 to 11 months; range, 0.1 to ⬎ 44
months) (p ⬍ .0001).

table 6.

the effects of treatment on transformation to aml or death
are illustrated in fig 3. the median time to event for supportive
care was 12 months (95% ci, 8 to 15 months) compared with
21 months (95% ci, 16 to 27 months) for aza c (p ⫽ .007).
for patients with high-risk fab subtypes (raeb, raebt, or
cmmol), the median time to aml or death for supportive
care was 8 months (95% ci, 4 to 13 months) compared with 19
months (95% ci, 13 to 21 months) for aza c (p ⫽ .004).
there were an insufficient number of events to estimate
medians in the patients with low-risk fab. overall, fab
subtype was a significant predictor of time to aml or death
(p ⫽ .0003).
transformation to aml occurred as the first event in
15% of the patients randomized to aza c compared with
38% of patients randomized to supportive care (p ⫽ .001).
indeed, during the first 6 months after study entry, 3% of
patients taking aza c transformed to aml while 24% of
patients on supportive care transformed (p ⬍ .0001). of the
patients who transformed to aml in the supportive care
group, 77% were diagnosed at study entry as having
ra/rars or raeb but not raeb-t. figure 4 represents
the percent bone marrow myeloblasts at study entry compared with the percentage of blasts in the marrow or
peripheral blood (national cancer institute criteria) at the
time of transformation. to demonstrate the biologic impact
on survival of the transformation to leukemia, we performed
a landmark analysis after a 12-month date of the association
of transformation to aml with survival. the two subgroups
included 13 patients who had already transformed to aml
by the landmark date and 93 patients who had not yet
transformed, both groups independent of therapy. patients
who died before 12 months were excluded. the median
additional survival (after the 12-month landmark) was 3
months (95% ci, 1 to 11 months) for patients who had
already transformed and 18 months (95% ci, 14 to 26
months) for patients who had not yet transformed to aml
(p ⬍ .001).

patients who achieved cr or pr are not included.

effects on rbc and platelets
the mean number of rbc transfusions increased for the
patients taking aza c in the first month of treatment but
thereafter declined, whereas the mean number of transfusions remained stable or increased for patients on supportive
care. by definition (table 3), patients achieving cr or pr
had an elimination of rbc or platelet transfusion requirements. among the 37 patients improved, 73% had an rbc
response, 35% (n ⫽ 13) had a 50% or greater restitution in
the rbc deficit (lineage response), 22% (n ⫽ 8) had an
elimination of all rbc transfusion requirements, and 16%
(n ⫽ 6) had a decrease by 50% or greater in rbc
transfusions. thus, among the 99 patients randomized to

patients receiving rbc transfusions at study entry, 29
(45%) had an elimination of all transfusions and another six

lineage responses for platelets and wbc occurred in 47%
and 40%, respectively, among those treated with aza c.
effects of treatment on qol
patients on the aza c arm experienced significantly
greater improvement over time in fatigue (eortc, p ⫽

(eortc, p ⫽ .0014), psychosocial distress (mhi, p ⫽

the supportive care group. significant differences persisted
after controlling for rbc transfusions. before cross-over,
the qol of patients on supportive care was stable or
worsening. after cross-over to aza c, significant improvements occurred in fatigue (eortc, p ⫽ .0001), physical
functioning (eortc, p ⫽ .004), dyspnea (eortc, p ⫽

effects as explanations for improvements in qol by aza c.
overall survival
the median survival was 20 months (95% ci, 16 to 26
months) for patients randomized to aza c compared with
14 months (95% ci, 12 to 14 months) for patients undergoing supportive care (53% of whom received aza c after
cross-over) (p ⫽ .10)(fig 5). to eliminate the confounding
effect caused by including the 49 cross-over patients in the
survival analysis, a landmark analysis was done in which
the survival of three subgroups of patients were compared
from a 6-month landmark date. these subgroups were
supportive care patients who never crossed over or who
crossed over only after 6 months, supportive care patients
who crossed before 6 months, and patients who were
initially randomized to aza c. the 36 patients who died
before the landmark date were excluded. the median
survival (after the 6-month landmark date) for these three
groups was 11, 14, and 18 months, respectively (fig 6). the
aza c group was significantly different from the supportive
care subgroup who crossed over late or never (p ⫽ 0.03).
supportive care patients who crossed over early (subgroup 2) had a longer median survival than the patients
who crossed over late or never (subgroup 1), although
this did not reach statistical significance (p ⫽ .11).
survival by treatment arm and fab risk group is demonstrated in fig 7.

the most common toxicity of aza c was myelosuppression.
in patients with severe cytopenias from their disease,toxicity
was difficult to assess, rendering useless the standard criteria
used for hematologic toxicity where the pretreatment marrow
is normal. on the basis of standard calgb criteria, grade 3 or
4 leukopenia occurred in 59%, granulocytopenia in 81%, and
thrombocytopenia in 70% of patients receiving aza c. when
hematologic toxicity was reassessed centrally using relative
changes in peripheral-blood counts compared with those at
study entry, a decrease of 50% to 74% was defined as grade 3
and 75% or greater was defined as grade 4. based on these
criteria, grade 3 or 4 leukopenia occurred in 43%, granulocytopenia in 58%, and thrombocytopenia in 52% of patients
receiving aza c. toxicity was transient, and patients usually
recovered in time for the next treatment cycle. infection was
thought to have been related to treatment in 20% of patients.
nausea or vomiting occurred in 4%. there was one (ⱕ 1%)
treatment-related death.
discussion

the present results confirm our earlier observations of the
beneficial effects of aza c on bone marrow function in
high-risk mds and extend these findings to symptomatic
ra and rars. the same stringent response criteria used in
our original trials of aza c, developed and defined in the
absence of standardized criteria, were used in the present
study.39 the 5% response rate in the supportive care arm
indicates that the criteria are sufficiently robust to filter out
ordinary variation in blood counts. incremental changes in
peripheral-blood counts among patients improved were
sizable (fig 1). thus, patients were not categorized as

improved on the basis of only a marginal increase in counts
as a potential byproduct produced by a quirk of the response
criteria. the 60% response rate for aza c shows that the
criteria are sensitive and specific enough to detect biologically important changes, because they are associated with
prolonged survival and improved qol. our patients were
treated at 26 academic centers and 30 of their community
affiliates. thus, our results may predict general medical
community achievement.
the number of deaths in the two arms in the first 4
months of study was comparable. the frequency of transformation to leukemia for patients on supportive care was
eight-fold higher than patients treated with aza c in the first
6 months from study entry. over the entire course of the
study, the rate was 2.5-fold higher, the lesser frequency
possibly reflecting the fact that many patients were receiving aza c after cross-over. differences between the arms in
leukemic transformation could not be explained by fab
subtype, international prognostic scoring system scores, or
time from diagnosis to study entry. time to leukemic
transformation or death represents the purest and most
objective manifestation of disease progression for mds.
the landmark analysis demonstrates that transformation to
aml has a significantly adverse effect on survival. aza c
delays and decreases transformation to acute leukemia. this
is the first description of a drug with this capacity.

the effect of initial treatment with aza c on overall
survival was confounded by the fact that 49 supportive care
patients were crossed over to aza c during their survival
follow-up. the landmark analysis diminishes the confounding effect and demonstrates a significant survival advantage
in favor of those treated with aza c initially compared with
those not treated or who received treatment only after 6
months of supportive care (fig 6). a salvage benefit may
nonetheless still be important even for patients treated late
in the course of their disease.
significant improvements in qol, particularly for fatigue, physical functioning, dyspnea, and general wellbeing, were derived from aza c treatment, even in the
supportive care patients after cross-over. the data indicate
that aza c treatment is more effective in improving qol than simply raising hemoglobin values with
rbc transfusions.
aza c appears to be superior to other drugs that have
been used for mds. agents that can induce hematopoietic
differentiation in vitro have been extensively tested, and
13-cis- and all- xxxd3417xxx , 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin
d3, butyrate,  xxxd1790xxx , and  xxxd2277xxx 
have produced feeble clinical responses.  xxxd142xxx  has
produced responses, but its activity has yet to be fully
defined.54 none of these drugs have caused significant
trilineage responses, sustained remissions, or prolonged

newer agents such as  xxxd3401xxx  alone or in combination

or survival.22,73  xxxd2106xxx  (g-csf) was compared with
supportive care. the death rate for patients with raeb and
raeb-t was significantly accelerated by g-csf, with a
median survival of 10 months compared with 21 months for
supportive care, leading to early termination of the study.74
treatment with  xxxg526xxx  (gm-csf) resulted in increases in myelomonocytic and lymphoid lineages, with a
decrease in frequency of infections in those treated. there
were no effects on platelets or  xxxd187xxx . impact on outcome
has not been reported.11
the mechanism by which aza c produces its effects is
most likely multifactorial. aza c can produce significant
myelosuppression, particularly at higher doses. the doses
used in this study and the two prior phase ii studies
produced marrow hypoplasia in only 10% of patients.
nevertheless, myelosuppression leading to lower peripheral-blood counts and increased rbc transfusion requirements occurred during the first cycle of treatment. continued treatment without dose reduction led to improved bone
marrow function in most patients. prolonged treatment may
have inhibited the mds clone, permitting residual normal
hematopoiesis to emerge. conversely, aza c might have
exerted a cytotoxic effect on regulatory t cells or other
modulatory cells that were inhibiting hematopoiesis.
aza c could also be acting as a biologic response
modifier. the response of hematopoietic progenitors to
cytokines is impaired in patients with mds.75 this may be
attributable in part to abnormalities of the signal transduction pathway downstream from the cytokine receptors.76-79
in vitro data suggest that aza c can modulate the cytokine
signal transduction pathway, rendering sensitive unrespon-

sive cells to the effects of cytokines, partially restoring
normal hematopoietic regulation.80-82
as observed in our prior studies, most responding patients demonstrated response beginning in the third or fourth
month. this is consistent both with a low-dose cytotoxic
effect and with aza c acting as a biologic response
modifier. incorporation of aza c into dna inhibits dna
methyltransferase and induces dna hypomethylation.32,83-86 this effect is s-phase dependent, and two or
more cycles of dna synthesis are required to alter gene
transcription and expression.32,84-86 thus, repetitive exposure on the present low-dose intermittent schedule may have
affected small numbers of cells during each treatment,
requiring three to four cycles before the effects became
clinically apparent. alteration in the methylation of the p15
gene has been implicated in transformation of mds to aml

and could be modulated by aza c, thus reducing risk of
leukemic transformation.87,88
although aza c is active in the present regimen, other
doses and schedules might improve its efficacy. additional
studies of aza c should build on these results. besides
optimization of dose and schedule, combinations with
cytokines and other agents that modulate signal transduction
are logical areas of exploration. the present study demonstrates that aza c is effective therapy for patients with mds
with the subgroups and profiles treated in this study. aza c
improves their bone marrow function, decreases and delays
significantly transformation to aml, and improves qol
and survival compared with supportive care. these data
suggest that aza c should be considered the treatment of
choice for patients with mds who meet the entry criteria
stipulated in this study.
