mechanistic aspects of inflammation and clinical
management of inflammation in acute gouty arthritis
bruce n. cronstein, md* and prashanth sunkureddi, mdþ

abstract: it has been recently demonstrated that interleukin 1a ( xxxg1169xxx )
plays a central role in monosodium urate crystalyinduced inflammation
and that the  xxxg1567xxx  inflammasome plays a major role in  xxxg1169xxx  production.
these discoveries have offered new insights into the pathogenesis of acute
gouty arthritis. in this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms by
which monosodium urate crystals induce acute inflammation and examine
the mechanisms of action (moas) of traditional anti-inflammatory drugs
(e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine, and glucocorticoids) and biologic agents (e.g., the  xxxg1169xxx  antagonists  xxxg1172xxx ,  xxxd3120xxx ,
and  xxxd414xxx ) to understand how their moas contribute to their safety
profiles. traditional anti-inflammatory agents may act on the  xxxg1169xxx  pathway at some level; however, their moas are broad-ranging, unspecific,
and biologically complex. this lack of specificity may explain the range of
systemic adverse effects associated with them. the therapeutic margins of
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine, and glucocorticoids are
particularly low in elderly patients and in patients with cardiovascular,
metabolic, or renal comorbidities that are frequently associated with gouty
arthritis. in contrast, the  xxxg1169xxx  antagonists act on very specific targets of
inflammation, which may decrease the potential for systemic adverse
effects, although infrequent but serious adverse events (including infection
and administration reactions) have been reported. because these  xxxg1169xxx

lthough gouty arthritis has been recognized as a distinct
pathologic entity since ancient times, the molecular pathogenesis of acute gouty attacks, and the sequence of pathologic
events resulting in chronic tophaceous gout is only now becoming
fully understood. clearly, monosodium urate (msu) crystals are
at the center of the pathophysiologic sequence, and although their
role in gout was well described by garrod1 in the 19th century,
their role in the pathogenesis of acute gouty arthritis had to be
rediscovered in 1966.2 the broader understanding of the pathogenesis of acute gouty arthritis has led to a new understanding
of the mechanism of action (moa) of agents commonly used to
treat gouty arthritis and has resulted in the development of novel
therapies for acute gouty arthritis. in this review, we discuss the
molecular mechanisms by which msu crystals induce acute inflammation, the mechanisms by which current therapies interfere
with and suppress the inflammation associated with acute gouty
arthritis, the mechanisms associated with typical adverse events
(aes) associated with traditional gouty arthritis anti-inflammatory
therapies, and the potential mechanistic advantages of biologic
therapies that specifically target the interleukin 1a ( xxxg1169xxx ) inflammation pathway.

inflammation, an overview
inflammation is characterized by rubor, tumor, calor, dolor,
and functio laesa (redness, swelling, heat, pain, and loss of function).3 vascular events, including dilatation, leakiness, and expression of molecules involved in the recruitment of leukocytes,
play a major role in the first 3 characteristics and result in the
accumulation of neutrophils, macrophages/monocytes, and other
inflammatory cells at inflamed sites.3 the vascular endothelium
plays a central role in these events and may be influenced by a
variety of intercellular messengers ranging from small molecules (e.g., eicosanoids, histamine) to peptide messengers (e.g.,
cytokines and chemokines).3y6 in turn, the vascular endothelium
will secrete agents including eicosanoids and cytokines, which
influence the inflammatory process.3 vascular endothelial cells
recruit leukocytes through the expression of adhesion molecules
at inflamed sites, and different vascular adhesion molecules recruit different cell types. in acute gouty attacks, neutrophils are
the predominant cell type, and these cells adhere to the endothelial
surface proteins  xxxg2048xxx ,  xxxg2049xxx , and intercellular adhesion
molecule 1, which are expressed or up-regulated at inflamed
sites.7 cytokines, such as  xxxg1169xxx  and  xxxg2296xxx  >
(tnf->), are the primary stimuli for endothelial expression and

up-regulation of these adhesive molecules. older studies have
implicated msu-induced release of  xxxg1170xxx  as central to the initiation of inflammation,4,5 and recent studies indicate that uptake
of msu crystals by cells activates the  xxxg1567xxx  inflammasome,
leading to the elaboration of activated  xxxg1170xxx .8 in acute gouty
attacks, the predominant cellular infiltrate is composed almost
exclusively of neutrophils.  xxxg562xxx  and its receptor on neutrophils,  xxxg564xxx , are required for the development of an acute
inflammatory response to msu crystals.9

monosodium urate crystals and
inflammation
in individuals who suffer from both acute gouty attacks and
chronic tophaceous gout, msu crystals are present in both symptomatic and asymptomatic joint tissue and joint fluid. many
events can set off acute gouty attacks, including overindulgence
in alcohol, metabolic stresses such as those that accompany acute
myocardial infarctions or surgery, or, most predictably, major shifts
in serum  xxxd3472xxx  levels leading to resorption of msu crystals,
such as occurs after starting urate-lowering therapy.10,11 it is now
clear that, in response to msu crystals, the cells in the joints that
initiate the inflammatory cascade are macrophages; these cells
phagocytose msu crystals and release chemoattractants, such
as leukotrienes, il-8, and others, which recruit neutrophils to the
site and start the inflammatory cascade.12,13 once recruited to the
joint, neutrophils phagocytose msu crystals and further contribute to the inflammation that characterizes acute gouty attacks.
the mechanisms by which cells take up msu crystals and
activate the inflammatory cascade have been under study for many
years, and a number of mechanisms have been proposed and
investigated to explain uptake of msu crystals by leukocytes.
monosodium urate crystals are hygroscopic and bind many different proteins to their surface, including immunoglobulin g and
complement proteins,14y19 which interact with specific receptors
on leukocytes to promote leukocyte recruitment and crystal
phagocytosis. one experimental problem that has hindered our
understanding of the mechanism by which msu crystals interact
with and activate leukocytes is that many msu preparations used
for in vitro studies are contaminated by endotoxin, which directly
stimulates toll-like receptors (tlrs) on leukocytes. subsequent
studies in which endotoxin contamination was eliminated indicated that msu crystals directly interacted with cd14, a leukocyte cell-surface molecule that interacts with tlr2 and tlr4
to stimulate leukocytes,20 in addition to promoting phagocytosis
via complement and immunoglobulin receptors. regardless of
the mechanism by which the msu crystals are phagocytosed, the
crystals interact with tlr2 and tlr4 as well as with the  xxxg1567xxx 
inflammasome to stimulate leukocyte activation, leading to the
inflammatory cascade.8
in 2006, martinon and colleagues8 first demonstrated that
msu crystals activate a specific inflammatory cascade in leukocytes leading to production of  xxxg1170xxx . essentially, these authors
demonstrated that crystals (msu and calcium pyrophosphate
dihydrate [the crystals that cause calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate disease]) engage the  xxxg1567xxx  ( xxxg1567xxx ) inflammasome, a
signaling protein complex in leukocytes that, linked by the
adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein, activates
 xxxg340xxx .  xxxg340xxx , or the neutrophil protease  xxxg1855xxx ,21
cleaves proyil-1a to generate  xxxg1169xxx , permitting the release of
 xxxg1169xxx  into the extracellular space. once secreted,  xxxg1169xxx  leads to
activation of vascular endothelium and production of other chemokines and cytokines, resulting in the recruitment of leukocytes. based on their homology to  xxxg340xxx  and  xxxg1855xxx ,
other neutrophil proteases are likely to play a role in activation of
proyil-1 to  xxxg1169xxx  as well.22 in addition to the in vitro evidence of

 xxxg1567xxx  activation, increased  xxxg340xxx  activation, and increased
 xxxg1170xxx  production by cells exposed to crystals, mice lacking  xxxg1567xxx 
did not mount much of an inflammatory response to challenge
with msu crystals, with few leukocytes present in the exudate.
thus, the demonstration that the  xxxg1567xxx  inflammasome plays a
central role in response to pathogenic crystals leading to  xxxg1169xxx 
production and that  xxxg1169xxx  plays the central role in crystal-induced
inflammation offered a new insight into the pathogenesis of gouty
arthritis.8
subsequent work has provided evidence that other factors
contribute to msu-mediated activation of the inflammasome.23,24
joosten and colleagues24 reported that free  xxxd2154xxx , which activate tlr2, further drive msu-induced  xxxg1169xxx  production.
moreover, prior studies had demonstrated that msu crystals induce increased expression of  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) with
enhanced production of inflammatory prostaglandins that also
likely contribute to the enhanced  xxxg1169xxx  production.25y28
it did not take long for investigators to carry out confirmatory experiments in patients with acute gouty attacks. administration of an  xxxg1169xxx / xxxg1170xxx > blocker (the recombinant  xxxg1170xxx  receptor
[ xxxg1171xxx ] antagonist  xxxg1172xxx ),29,30 a chimeric  xxxg1170xxx  trap dimeric
fusion protein consisting of portions of  xxxg1171xxx  and the  xxxg1171xxx  accessory protein that neutralizes both  xxxg1169xxx  and  xxxg1170xxx > ( xxxd3120xxx ),31 or a fully human monoclonal antibody that neutralizes the
activity of human  xxxg1169xxx  ( xxxd414xxx ),32 all have some efficacy
in the treatment of acute gouty arthritis.33 intracellular  xxxg1169xxx  signals for inflammation via activation of nuclear factor jb (nf-jb)
and other studies have shown that signaling molecules downstream of the  xxxg1170xxx  receptor ( xxxg1489xxx ) are required for msu to activate nf-jb and for the development of crystal-induced arthritis.34

termination of acute gouty attacks
acute gouty arthritis attacks are generally self-limited and
last less than 3 to 4 weeks. very little is understood at present
about how gouty arthritis attacks spontaneously terminate despite
the ongoing presence of the inciting agent. one suggestion has
been that monocytes/macrophages that take up the apoptotic
neutrophils from the joint secrete transforming growth  xxxd2925xxx 
and other anti-inflammatory mediators that terminate the attack.35
similar uptake of apoptotic neutrophils occurs in rheumatoid arthritis without termination or amelioration of inflammation, so
there must be other factors at work as well.36 recent work has
indicated that interaction of free  xxxd2154xxx  with tlr2 is required
for urate crystalymediated activation of the inflammasome, production of active  xxxg1170xxx , and acute inflammation.24 this finding has
suggested that the elevation of free  xxxd2154xxx  following a heavy
meal plays a critical role in the induction of acute gouty attacks.
interestingly, it has long been known that low-density lipoprotein
(specifically  xxxg175xxx  in the low-density lipoprotein),
commonly elevated in many patients with gout, binds to msu
crystals and prevents neutrophil activation by crystals, another
potential mechanism for suppression of inflammation during intercurrent gout.

should be initiated to prevent future acute attacks and long-term
complications associated with chronic tophaceous gout (e.g., joint
destruction).11
long before the development of biologic agents that target
 xxxg1169xxx , other therapies had been used successfully and are still
currently used for the prevention and treatment of acute gouty attacks, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids),
colchicine, and glucocorticoids. figure 1 provides an overview of
the sites of action of traditional therapies and new biologic agents
involved in mediating crystal-induced inflammation. these traditional therapies are effective in reducing inflammation, with
symptomatic relief occurring within 24 hours.37,38 research on
traditional agents continues, with the agree study demonstrating that low doses of colchicines are as effective as high doses
over 24 hours, with safety similar to placebo.38 glucocorticoids
are a good option in patients with contraindications to nsaids
and colchicine or in refractory cases,39 although a meta-analysis
showed inconclusive evidence for their effectiveness compared
with other anti-inflammatory agents.40
current gouty arthritis treatment guidelines recommend oral
nsaids or colchicine a first-line systemic treatment for acute
attacks.41 however, the moas through which nsaids and colchicine reduce inflammation are not specific, and the systemic
actions of these drugs are known to cause severe aes in some

inflammation in acute gouty arthritis

patients.42,43 for example, nsaids are associated with adverse
gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular effects,43,44 and at therapeutic doses, colchicine is associated with safety concerns such as
blood dyscrasias, drug-drug interactions, neuromuscular toxicity,
and gastrointestinal aes.42
because gouty arthritis is associated with several comorbidities (including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, type
2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome,
chronic kidney disease, and nephrolithiasis),45,46 contraindications
to nsaids and/or colchicine are common.47 in a study that reviewed medical records from the department of veterans affairs,
of 575 patients diagnosed with gouty arthritis, more than 88% of
patients had at least 1 comorbid condition.47 in the same study,
more than 90% of patients had at least 1 contraindication to
nsaids, and approximately 50% of patients had at least 1 contraindication to colchicine.47
in patients who cannot tolerate nsaids or colchicine, and in
patients with polyarticular gouty arthritis or chronic kidney disease, glucocorticoids are recommended for the management of
acute gouty arthritis attacks.48 however, even with short-term use,
glucocorticoids have been associated with aes, such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus.49 in patients with preexisting impaired glucose tolerance, the diabetogenic effects associated with
glucocorticoids can be particularly substantial.49

below, we present a detailed examination of the moas of
traditional anti-inflammatory drugs and how their varied actions
may contribute to the safety profiles of these agents. we then

selective cox-2 inhibitors were developed to reduce the risk
of gastrointestinal complications associated with nonselective
nsaids; however, selective cox-2 inhibitors were found to be
associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. of
note, 2 widely used cox-2 inhibitors, rofecoxib and  xxxd3481xxx ,
were withdrawn from the global market due to cardiovascular
safety concerns.54 the cardiovascular risks associated with selective cox-2 inhibitors have been confirmed in several
studies,55y57 and these findings have recently been extended to
some nonselective nsaids.44,54,58 the cardiovascular risks associated with nsaids (including increased risk of recurrent
myocardial infarction and death) have been observed even with
short-term use (i.e., g1 week), as is common for the management
of acute gouty arthritis flares.54
 xxxg1884xxx  inhibition promotes cardiovascular injury through several mechanisms. selective cox-2 inhibition
leads to a loss of the majority of cox-2yderived vascular
prostacyclin synthesis without alteration in platelet thromboxane synthesis.51 prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation, leukocyte adhesion, and vascular
smooth muscle cell proliferation in the kidneys, liver, lungs, and
heart. therefore, suppression of cox-2yderived prostacyclin
by both nonselective nsaids and selective cox-2 inhibitors
increases the risk of thrombosis, hypertension, atherosclerosis,
and myocardial infarction.3,51 it has also been hypothesized that
the increase in leukotriene biosynthesis that results from the
shunting of  xxxd208xxx  to the lox pathway may increase
the risk of atherosclerosis.51,59
 xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2 are both expressed in the
kidneys. the effects of nsaid-induced inhibition of renal  xxxd1903xxx  can result in sodium retention, edema, and exacerbation of hypertension. inhibition of prostacyclin expression can
decrease renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, which
can lead to hyperkalemia as a result of decreased potassium excretion.  xxxg1884xxx  inhibition can be especially problematic in elderly patients, in whom cox-2 expression has been
detected in the macula densa.60

colchicine

dates back to the ancient greeks and egyptians (extracts of colchicum autumnale

cardiovascular comorbidities associated with gouty arthritis.62
similar to cyp3a4 inhibitors, the use of p-gpymodulating
agents in combination with colchicine can lead to intracellular
colchicine accumulation, with increases in pharmacologic effects
or toxicity.62
colchicine’s interactions with microtubules can cause accumulation of lysosomes and autophagic vacuoles in the cytoskeleton, resulting in pathologic alterations in skeletal muscle and
induction of significant axonal neuropathy. these adverse consequences may present as myopathy (e.g., rhabdomyolysis), neuropathy, or bone marrow suppression.76 although the likelihood
of serious aes associated with colchicine is generally considered
to be dose-dependent (i.e., mortality rates are estimated  xxxd1891xxx % at
doses 90.5 mg/kg),42,62 an analysis by wilbur and makowsky76
identified cases of colchicine-induced myotoxicity at lower
doses. in the 75 cases identified, the mean cumulative daily dose
of colchicine was only 1.4 (sd, 0.96) mg76 (for comparison,

&

volume 19, number 1, january 2013

standard therapeutic doses of colchicine for acute gouty arthritis
attacks are 1.2 mg at the first sign of a flare followed by 0.6 mg at
1 hour later).63 in many of the cases, patients had been receiving
standard doses of colchicine for long periods but experienced
recent declines in renal function or other underlying conditions.76

glucocorticoids
glucocorticoids have long been used to treat acute gouty
arthritis attacks, particularly in patients who are intolerant to
nsaids or colchicines.48 this class of agents has many welldescribed anti-inflammatory actions that are mediated through
binding interactions with glucocorticoid receptors, which are localized in the cytoplasm of target cells found in almost all tissues
in the human body.77,78 the complex molecular architecture of
glucocorticoid-induced antagonism of inflammation is outlined
in figure 3.

figure 3. partial molecular architecture underlying the glucocorticoid-induced antagonism of inflammation.80 inflammatory pathways
are characterized by positive feedback loops (i.e., cytokines activate nf-jb, which in turn stimulates the synthesis of more cytokines) and
by redundancy (i.e., cytokines also activate c-junyfos). the  xxxg1601xxx  inhibits these pathways at multiple points by directly
blocking the transcription of inflammatory proteins by nf-jb and  xxxg810xxx   xxxg1222xxx   xxxg1223xxx   xxxg1224xxx  and by inducing the expression of anti-inflammatory

the clinical success of glucocorticoids as effective antiinflammatory agents is largely attributed to their ability to reduce
the expression of proinflammatory genes via activation of the
 xxxg1601xxx  and the concomitant inhibition proinflammatory transcription factors (e.g., nf-jb and activating
protein 1) through a mechanism known as transrepression.78
in acute gouty arthritis, the most notable anti-inflammatory action
of glucocorticoids is the capacity of these agents to prevent activation of nf-jb by either tnf-> or  xxxg1169xxx . glucocorticoids increase the expression of the inhibitor of jb (ijb), which is the
cytoplasmic chaperone that prevents translocation of nf-jb to
the nucleus.79 thus, glucocorticoids prevent  xxxg1169xxx  from stimulating the inflammatory cascade.
however, much of the anti-inflammatory efficacy of glucocorticoids results from the pleiotropic effects of the glucocorticoid
receptor on diverse signaling pathways through direct and indirect
genomic effects. this pleiotropy, along with known nongenomic
effects involving second-messenger and membrane-associated
receptor signaling, can result in a broad range of adverse effects.80
in addition to nf-jb and activating protein 1, other transcription factors that are negatively regulated by the glucocorticoid
receptor via transrepression include  xxxd1773xxx  response element-binding protein, interferon regulatory
factor 3, nuclear factor of activated t cells, signal transducer
and activator of transcription,  xxxg2252xxx , and
gata-binding protein 3. target genes involved in transrepression
include those encoding for a broad range of inflammatory cytokines, enzymes, receptors, and adhesion molecules, notably,  xxxg1169xxx , il-2,  xxxg1177xxx , il-4,  xxxg1180xxx , il-6, il-8, il-12, cox-2,  xxxg2048xxx ,
and tnf-

 xxxg1172xxx  (4-weeks’duration) demonstrated that  xxxg1169xxx  antagonists
are generally well tolerated in patients with gouty arthritis,29,32,89,90
although infrequent but serious aes, including infections and administration reactions, have been reported. safety results of recently
published phase iii trials (of short duration of 16y24 weeks) for
 xxxd414xxx  and rilonacept87,88 are consistent with these earlier
phase ii results. in the  xxxd414xxx  phase iii trials,87 the most
common aes were back pain, hypertension, and headache. in the
 xxxd3120xxx  phase iii trial,88 the most common aes were injection-site
