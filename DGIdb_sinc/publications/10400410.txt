summary
abstract

 xxxd3410xxx  is a synthetic derivative of the amino acid lysine that exerts its
antifibrinolytic effect through the reversible blockade of lysine binding sites on
plasminogen molecules.
intravenously administered  xxxd3410xxx  (most commonly 10 mg/kg followed by infusion of 1 mg/kg/hour) caused reductions relative to placebo of 29
to 54% in postoperative blood losses in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with
cardiopulmonary bypass (cpb), with statistically significant reductions in transfusion requirements in some studies.  xxxd3410xxx  had similar efficacy to
aprotinin 2 × 106 kallikrein inhibitory units (kiu) and was superior to  xxxd1914xxx  in the reduction of postoperative blood losses. transfusion requirements
were reduced significantly by 43% with  xxxd3410xxx  and by 60% with aprotinin in 1 study. meta-analysis of 60 trials showed  xxxd3410xxx  and aprotinin,
unlike epsilon- xxxd146xxx  acid ( xxxd146xxx ) and desmopressin, to reduce significantly
the number of patients requiring allogeneic blood transfusions after cardiac surgery with cpb.
 xxxd3410xxx  was associated with reductions relative to placebo in mortality of 5 to 54% in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. meta-analysis
indicated a reduction of 40%.
reductions of 34 to 57.9% versus placebo or control in mean menstrual blood
loss occurred during  xxxd3410xxx  therapy in women with menorrhagia; the
drug has also been used to good effect in placental bleeding, postpartum haemorrhage and conisation of the cervix.  xxxd3410xxx  significantly reduced mean
blood losses after oral surgery in patients with haemophilia and was effective as
a mouthwash in dental patients receiving oral anticoagulants.
reductions in blood loss were also obtained with the use of the drug in patients
undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation or transurethral prostatic surgery, and
rates of rebleeding were reduced in patients with traumatic hyphaema. clinical
benefit has also been reported with  xxxd3410xxx  in patients with hereditary
angioneurotic oedema.
 xxxd3410xxx  is well tolerated; nausea and diarrhoea are the most common
adverse events. increased risk of thrombosis with the drug has not been demonstrated in clinical trials.
conclusions:  xxxd3410xxx  is useful in a wide range of haemorrhagic
conditions. the drug reduces postoperative blood losses and transfusion requirements in a number of types of surgery, with potential cost and tolerability advantages over aprotinin, and appears to reduce rates of mortality and urgent surgery
in patients with upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage.  xxxd3410xxx  reduces
menstrual blood loss and is a possible alternative to surgery in menorrhagia, and
has been used successfully to control bleeding in pregnancy.

 xxxd3410xxx : a review

1007

pharmacodynamic
properties

 xxxd3410xxx  exerts its antifibrinolytic effect by blocking lysine binding sites
on plasminogen molecules and thereby inhibiting the interaction of plasminogen
and the heavy chain of plasmin with lysine residues on the surface of fibrin.
although plasmin can still be formed under these circumstances, it is unable to
bind to and degrade fibrin.
 xxxd3410xxx  is 6 to 10 times more potent in terms of binding to plasminogen/plasmin than the other synthetic antifibrinolytic agent epsilon- xxxd146xxx  acid
( xxxd146xxx ). suppression of fibrinolysis by  xxxd3410xxx  is manifested in surgical
patients by reductions in blood levels of d-dimer, but the drug has no effect on
blood coagulation parameters. concurrent administration of heparin does not
influence the activity of  xxxd3410xxx .

pharmacokinetic
properties

maximum plasma concentrations of  xxxd3410xxx  are attained within 3 hours
of an oral dose; the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract has no effect on
the pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug. elimination after intravenous administration is triexponential, and over 95% of each dose is eliminated as unchanged drug in the urine. the total cumulative excretion after an intravenous
dose is approximately 90% after 24 hours.
of the total amount of circulating  xxxd3410xxx , 3% is bound to plasminogen. the drug crosses the blood-brain barrier and the placenta, but excretion into
breast milk is minimal.  xxxd3410xxx  is not detectable in saliva after systemic
(oral) administration, and mouthwashing with 5% w/v aqueous solutions of the
drug results in plasma drug concentrations below 2 mg/l.

therapeutic use

cardiac surgery. perioperative treatment with  xxxd3410xxx  (most commonly
as an intravenous loading dose of 10 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 1 mg/kg/hour)
resulted in significant reductions in postoperative blood losses (mostly measured
over 12 to 24 hours) in randomised, double-blind comparisons with placebo in
patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (cpb). losses
via mediastinal drains were reduced by 29 to 54% relative to placebo, and statistically significant reductions in red blood cell transfusion requirements were reported in some but not all studies. inconsistency in results with respect to
reduction or elimination of transfusions may have been caused in part by variation
between institutions in transfusion criteria.
the protease inhibitor aprotinin has been the most frequently used comparator
in randomised but nonblind studies of  xxxd3410xxx  in patients undergoing
cardiac surgery with cpb. postoperative blood losses (over 6 hours) were reduced
to a similar extent by  xxxd3410xxx  10 mg/kg intravenously followed by infusion of 1 mg/kg/hour and aprotinin 2 × 106 kallikrein inhibitory units (kiu)
intravenously in 1 study, with both treatments being superior to  xxxd1914xxx .
similar effects on postoperative blood losses with the 2 drugs were reported in 2
further studies. both agents significantly reduced postoperative transfusion requirements in one of these trials (by 43 and 60% with  xxxd3410xxx  and
aprotinin, respectively; both p < 0.05 vs control group). other studies have shown
greater reductions in 24-hour blood losses with aprotinin or  xxxd146xxx  than with
 xxxd3410xxx , but definitive conclusions cannot be drawn from these trials
because of inconsistent transfusion data and small patient numbers.
a meta-analysis of 60 randomised clinical trials of haemostatic agents in cardiac surgery with cpb showed  xxxd3410xxx  to be associated with a significant
decrease (relative to placebo or no treatment) in the proportion of patients requir-

ing allogeneic blood transfusions. a similar effect was found with aprotinin but
not with  xxxd146xxx  or desmopressin.
acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. reduction of blood transfusion requirements with  xxxd3410xxx  therapy in patients with upper gastrointestinal
bleeding was first described in 1973. in randomised double-blind studies, predominantly in patients with peptic ulceration or erosion, reductions relative to
placebo in mortality rates have ranged from 5 to 54% with  xxxd3410xxx  (4.5
to 6g daily for 5 to 7 days in most studies); statistical significance between
 xxxd3410xxx  and placebo was obtained in the largest published trial.
meta-analysis of studies of  xxxd3410xxx  in patients with upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage showed the drug to be associated with reductions relative
to placebo of 20 to 30% in rates of rebleeding, 30 to 40% in the need for surgery
and 40% in mortality rates.
oral surgery. proportions of patients with postoperative bleeding complications ranged from 0 to 6.7% when mouthwashes of  xxxd3410xxx  were used
after oral surgery in patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy. the corresponding range in patients who received placebo was 13.3 to 40%. in patients
with haemophilia, 5 days’ treatment with  xxxd3410xxx  1g 3 times daily orally
resulted in a mean blood loss after oral surgery of 61.2ml, compared with an
84.1ml loss with placebo, and reduced consumption of clotting factors (14.3 vs
78.6% of patients).
other surgery. substantial and statistically significant reductions relative to
placebo in mean postoperative blood losses (57 and 65.9%) were reported in 2
trials after perioperative  xxxd3410xxx  therapy in patients undergoing total knee
arthroplasty, with significant reductions in transfusion requirements. clinical
benefit relative to placebo was obtained after intravenous infusion of tranexamic
acid 40 mg/kg/hour in 1 study in patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation, with no episodes of hepatic artery or portal vein thrombosis occurring
within 1 month of surgery.
four-week incidences of haemorrhage after transurethral prostatic surgery in
a randomised study in 100 men were 24% after treatment with  xxxd3410xxx 
(1g 3 times daily orally) and 56% in patients who received no antifibrinolytic
therapy.
gynaecology. reductions of 34 to 57.9% versus placebo or control in mean
menstrual blood loss were reported in women with menorrhagia receiving 2 to 3
cycles of treatment with  xxxd3410xxx . the drug was at least as effective as
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapy and more effective than etamsylate
(ethamsylate) or  xxxd2751xxx . efficacy of  xxxd3410xxx  in the control of
bleeding has also been reported in individual patients with placental abruption or
postpartum haemorrhage. a mean 71% reduction in postoperative blood loss was
noted in a double-blind study in patients who received  xxxd3410xxx  1.5g daily
orally for 12 days after conisation of the cervix. in another double-blind study, 1
of 38 patients who received  xxxd3410xxx  and 4 of 37 who received placebo
experienced late bleeding after cervical conisation with suturing; the difference
between groups was not statistically significant.
other indications. an oral dosage of  xxxd3410xxx  1g 3 times daily significantly reduced the frequency of secondary ocular haemorrhage after traumatic
hyphaema in controlled trials; further data from a case series of 340 children

showed rates of rebleeding of 1.1% and 9.6% in patients who received tranexamic
acid and no antifibrinolytic therapy, respectively.
reductions versus placebo in number and severity of attacks of oedema in
patients with hereditary angioneurotic oedema were reported in 2 randomised,
double-blind studies of  xxxd3410xxx , and clinical benefit was obtained with
the drug (1.5g orally 3 times daily) in 6 of 7 patients described in a case series.
there was a significant reduction (from 24% with placebo to 9% with  xxxd3410xxx  therapy for up to 4 weeks) in the rate of rebleeding in a randomised
double blind placebo-controlled study in 479 patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage. however, overall outcome was not improved with  xxxd3410xxx  after
3 months; this was attributed to an increase in incidence of cerebral ischaemia.
tolerability

 xxxd3410xxx  is well tolerated. adverse events are uncommon and usually
manifest as nausea or diarrhoea, or occasionally as orthostatic reactions. results
of controlled clinical studies have not confirmed concerns over the possibility of
an increased thrombotic tendency in patients treated with inhibitors of fibrinolysis. no increases in incidence of thrombotic events were reported with tranexamic
acid in studies of patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cpb or in a retrospective case analysis of 256 women with bleeding disorders in pregnancy. no mutagenic activity or harmful fetal effects of  xxxd3410xxx  have been reported.
retinal changes seen in dogs after very high dosages of  xxxd3410xxx  for 1
year have not been reported in humans receiving the drug at therapeutic dosages.
however, disturbances in colour vision have been documented, and patients who
develop this symptom should discontinue therapy.

dosage and
administration

 xxxd3410xxx  is presented in a variety of formulations for oral (tablets and
syrup) or intravenous use. a dosage of 500mg to 1g by slow intravenous injection
3 times daily or 1 to 1.5g 2 to 3 times daily orally is recommended for local
fibrinolysis. for general fibrinolysis, a single dose of 1g or 10 mg/kg by slow
intravenous injection is recommended.
patients undergoing cardiac surgery have most commonly received  xxxd3410xxx  intravenously as a 10 mg/kg dose before cpb and an infusion of 1
mg/kg/hour thereafter. a daily dosage of 4.5 to 6g daily (divided into 3 to 6 doses)
for 5 to 7 days (intravenous followed by oral therapy) has been used most frequently in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
patients with haemophilia who are about to undergo oral surgery require 1 to
1.5g orally every 8 hours, and a 4.8 to 5% mouthwash, used for 2 minutes 4 times
daily for 7 days, has shown good efficacy in dental patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.
intravenous infusion of 10 mg/kg before release of tourniquet may be used in
patients undergoing knee arthroplasty, and treatment with oral  xxxd3410xxx  6
to 12g daily for 4 days has been used in patients undergoing transurethral prostate
surgery. intravenous infusion of 40 mg/kg/hour has been used to good effect in
patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation.
women with menorrhagia should receive  xxxd3410xxx  1 to 1.5g 3 to 4 times
daily orally for 3 to 4 days. dosages of 1.5g or 1 to 1.5g orally 3 times daily are
recommended for conisation of the cervix or traumatic hyphaema, respectively,
and oral treatment with 1.5g 3 times daily is recommended for the management
of hereditary angioneurotic oedema.
 xxxd3410xxx  is contraindicated in patients with a history of thromboem-

bolic disease, and dosage reductions are recommended in patients with renal
insufficiency.

1. blood coagulation and the
fibrinolytic system
the blood coagulation cascade is the second key
element in the formation of the haemostatic seal at
sites of tissue injury, the first being the aggregation
and deposition of platelets. this cascade consists
of a sequence of reactions that leads to the cleavage
of prothrombin into 2 fragments, one of which is
the enzyme thrombin. thrombin in turn cleaves
small peptides from fibrinogen to produce fibrin
monomer which then polymerises to form insoluble fibrin. thrombin also activates factor xiii, an
enzyme that catalyses the formation of covalent
bonds between fibrin molecules to form a clot resistant to dissolution.[1]
the fibrinolytic system is activated by the deposition of fibrin and assists in the maintenance of
an open lumen in damaged blood vessels. a balance
between the formation and lysis of fibrin is required to maintain and remould the haemostatic
seal during the several days in which the injured
vessel wall is repaired.[1] fibrinolysis is mediated
through the activation of plasminogen, the plasma
precursor of the proteolytic enzyme plasmin. plasminogen binds to lysine residues on the surface of
fibrin and is converted to plasmin by an activator
released from endothelial cells [tissue plasminogen activator ( xxxg1766xxx )] that simultaneously binds to
fibrin. plasmin then degrades fibrin into large fragments known as x and y; these are subsequently
broken down into soluble fibrin degradation products.[1] excessive fibrinolysis is prevented by the
greater affinity of plasminogen for fibrin than for
fibrinogen and the increased ability of  xxxg1766xxx  to activate plasminogen when it is bound to fibrin. in addition, plasma contains a protease inhibitor called
 xxxg831xxx -antiplasmin that rapidly inactivates any plasmin
that escapes from a fibrin clot.[1]
defective formation or excessively rapid dissolution of fibrin results in excessive or recurrent
bleeding. the unwanted dissolution of haemostatic

fibrin can be prevented by antifibrinolytic drugs
that stabilise fibrin structures. two synthetic derivatives of the amino acid lysine,  xxxd3410xxx 
[4-(aminomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid] (fig.
1) and epsilon- xxxd146xxx  acid ( xxxd146xxx ;  xxxd146xxx ) have antifibrinolytic activity in humans.
the activity of the trans-isomer of  xxxd3410xxx 
was first described in 1964,[2] since which time the
drug has been used in a variety of clinical settings.
this review examines the status of the drug in the
management of surgical and other conditions in
which antifibrinolytic therapy is appropriate.
2. overview of pharmacodynamic
properties
the antifibrinolytic effect of  xxxd3410xxx 
results from the formation of a reversible complex
of the drug with plasminogen. human plasminogen contains lysine binding sites that are important
for interactions not only with synthetic antifibrinolytic amino acid derivatives but also with
 xxxg831xxx -antiplasmin and fibrin.[3] one of these binding
sites has a high affinity for  xxxd3410xxx  [dissociation constant (kd) = 1.1 mumol/l]; the others have
low affinity only (kd = 750 mumol/l). tranexamic
acid almost completely blocks the interaction of
plasminogen and the heavy chain of plasmin with
the lysine residues of fibrin monomer, primarily
through its binding to the high affinity lysine binding site of plasminogen.[4] saturation of this site
with  xxxd3410xxx  prevents binding of plasminogen to the surface of fibrin (fig. 2). this process

plasminogen to the fibrin molecule.

retards fibrinolysis because, although plasmin is
still formed, it is unable to bind to fibrinogen or
fibrin monomer. conversely, when the binding site
of plasmin is blocked by  xxxd3410xxx , inactivation by  xxxg831xxx -antiplasmin cannot proceed.
comparisons of the binding potencies of  xxxd3410xxx  and  xxxd146xxx  in fibrinolytic test systems
have shown  xxxd3410xxx  to be more potent by
a factor of between 6 and 10.[2,5-7]  xxxd3410xxx 
competitively inhibits the activation of trypsinogen by enterokinase and, at concentrations 4 times
greater, noncompetitively inhibits the proteolytic
action of trypsin.[8] the drug also weakly inhibits
thrombin.[5]
the noncovalent interactions between plasminogen/plasmin and other macromolecules such as
fibrin are mediated by a series of 5 triple disulphidebonded plasmin( xxxd2046xxx ) domains called kringles, each
of which has a single binding site for lysine ana© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

the pharmacodynamic effects of tranexamic
acid vary according to the indication in which the
drug is being used; observations from patients
undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary
bypass (cpb), women with menorrhagia, patients
undergoing total knee arthroplasty and recipients
of orthotopic liver transplants are summarised in
table i. in these studies, suppression of fibrinolysis
by  xxxd3410xxx  was manifested by reductions
in blood levels of d-dimer (a breakdown product
of cross-linked fibrin) relative to those in untreated
patients, and the drug had no effect overall on blood
coagulation parameters (e.g. platelet counts, activated partial thromboplastin times and prothrombin times). these observations are to be expected
in view of the mechanism of action of tranexamic
acid. improved platelet function was indicated by

plasma concentrations of  xxxd3410xxx  to be
reached within 3 hours of oral administration.[23]

administration of  xxxd3410xxx  (single dose of
1g), elimination followed 3 exponential phases, with
over 95% of the dose being excreted unchanged in
the urine. total clearance (cl) ranged from 6.6 to
7 l/h (110 to 116 ml/min) in the 3 individuals who
participated in this study. mean total urinary excretion in terms of quantity of drug administered was
959 mg/g.[23] other data have shown that approximately 30% of an intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg is
recovered in the urine during the first hour after
administration; the total excretion rises to 45% after 3 hours, and to approximately 90% after 24
hours.[5,6]
at therapeutic plasma concentrations (5 to 10
mg/l),  xxxd3410xxx  is weakly (approximately
3%) bound to plasma protein: this appears to be
fully accounted for by binding to plasminogen.[24]
the drug crosses the blood-brain barrier[25] and
diffuses rapidly into joint fluid and synovial membranes.[26] excretion in breast milk is low: the concentration of  xxxd3410xxx  in breast milk of lactating women 1 hour after the last dose of 2 days’
treatment was approximately 1% of the peak serum
concentration.[27] the drug also passes through the
placenta.[28,29]
 xxxd3410xxx  could not be detected in the
saliva of healthy volunteers who had received

single oral doses of 1g.[30] however, very high drug
concentrations (mean 200 mg/l) were attained in
saliva 30 minutes after mouth rinsing for 2 minutes
with a 5% aqueous solution of  xxxd3410xxx ,
while plasma concentrations remained below 2
mg/l. this formulation has been investigated in
patients undergoing oral surgery (section 4.4).
4. therapeutic use
4.1 use in cardiac surgery with
cardiopulmonary bypass

excessive bleeding after surgery involving cpb
is attributable to the size of the surgical wound required for these procedures and by the activation
of both coagulation and fibrinolysis by the passage
of blood through the cpb circuit. this stimulation
of the formation and dissolution of clots results in
excessive consumption of coagulation factors and
predisposes patients to prolonged and excessive
bleeding.[31]
the problem is exacerbated by loss of platelets
and impairment of their adhesion and aggregation
because of enzymatic and mechanical injury in the
extracorporeal oxygenator. transfused blood products are used extensively in patients undergoing
cardiac surgery, but recent concern over the availability and safety of these products has prompted
much interest in methods of minimising perioperative transfusion requirements.[32-34] these include
autologous blood donation, intra- and postoperative cell salvage, normovolaemic haemodilution
and pharmacological methods.[35] as drug therapy
is easy to use and allows the complex and timeconsuming measures associated with autologous
blood transfusion to be avoided,[34] prophylactic
administration of antifibrinolytic drugs in patients
undergoing cpb has been investigated extensively
since the late 1970s.
the most important outcome in studies of the
efficacy of antifibrinolytic therapy in patients who
undergo cardiac surgery is reduction in use of allogeneic blood products. however, many groups of
investigators have measured intermediate outcomes
(e.g. postoperative bleeding, coagulation profiles
© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

1013

and platelet counts) on the assumption that any
beneficial effects on these parameters will result in
reduced transfusion requirements.[36]
appropriate analysis of data is also important if
results are to be interpreted in a clinically relevant
manner: ideally, the percentage of patients who received allogeneic blood and the median number of
units used should be reported (since most blood
products are administered in predetermined units).
nonparametric statistical methods are also desirable in most analyses because blood product usage
does not follow a normal distribution: many patients will require few or no transfusions, whereas
a small number will require large quantities of red
cells and haemostatic products.[36]
the efficacy of  xxxd3410xxx  in the reduction of blood loss and transfusion requirements
in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cpb
has been assessed in comparisons with no antifibrinolytic therapy, with the other synthetic lysine
derivative  xxxd146xxx , with aprotinin (a protease inhibitor derived from bovine lung tissue) and with
desmopressin (a synthetic polypeptide related to
 xxxd3495xxx  that shortens bleeding time
by inducing factor viii: xxxg2423xxx  release). in this review, emphasis will be given to
randomised studies with untreated or placebo control groups in which proportions of patients who
received at least 1 unit of allogeneic red blood cells
after surgery were reported. most of the studies
were conducted in a double-blind manner; others
did not include administration of placebo infusions
to patients in the control group, however. studies
are summarised in tables iii and iv.
in most of the studies listed, patients underwent coronary artery bypass graft (cabg) surgery,
valve replacement or both. some investigators included only patients undergoing repeat surgery;[13,38]
this is noteworthy because such procedures are associated with longer coronary bypass times, more
extensive tissue dissection and more severe perioperative bleeding than primary cardiac surgery.[13] initial loading doses were typically given
20 to 30 minutes before surgery, with further drug
being infused during the procedure. however, a

single pre-operative dose was used alone in some
studies.[38,39,42,46] in addition, corbeau and colleagues[43] gave a second dose of  xxxd3410xxx 
after heparin reversal at the end of surgery, and
some investigators added additional drug to the
cpb circuit.[44,46] antifibrinolytic treatment was
most commonly given for 10 to 12 hours. appropriate nonparametric statistical methods were used
in most cases [or parametric analysis of variance
(anova) after logarithmic transformation of
data], although some investigators reported use of
t-tests only (with no further details of data handling).[37,45] blood losses were recorded most commonly over 12 to 24 hours, although some authors
reported 6-[48] or 48-hour[43] losses.
4.1.1 comparisons with placebo

overall,  xxxd3410xxx  was shown to be statistically and clinically superior to placebo in terms
of reduction of blood loss in the double-blind studies summarised in table iii. the most common
regimen consisted of a loading dose of 10 mg/kg
followed by an infusion of 1 mg/kg/hour (higher
dosages were shown to confer no additional benefit[12]). mediastinal drain losses in patients receiving the drug ranged in these studies from 29 to
54% of those seen with placebo, with reductions of
around one-third being most frequent. in addition,
karski et al. reported reductions in 24-hour blood
losses of 35 and 37% relative to placebo (p =
0.0001) after total perioperative  xxxd3410xxx 
doses of 10 and 20g, respectively, in their doubleblind study in 147 patients.[49] there was no statistically significant difference between the active
treatment groups.
statistically significant reductions in proportions
of patients who required transfusions of allogeneic
red blood cells were also reported,[13,15,42] although
these data are less consistent (table iii). coffey et
al.[37] and hardy et al.[39] showed transfusion requirements to be similar between groups. the reasons for these findings are not clear, although limited sizes of patient groups (especially in the study
of coffey et al.[37]) and the inclusion of patients
undergoing primary surgery only by hardy et al.[39]
may have contributed to this effect. furthermore,

transfusion criteria vary between different institutions and were not uniform across the studies.
horrow et al.[12] found no differences between
groups in transfusion requirements in their comparison of 5 dosages of  xxxd3410xxx  with placebo, and suggested that their strict criteria for
transfusion (including haematocrit ≤21%) might
have accounted for this.  xxxd3410xxx  was associated with a significant (p = 0.01) reduction in
median overall exposure to allogeneic blood products in the study of hardy et al., however.[39]
karski et al.[49] noted no overall difference in
red blood cell transfusion requirements between
treatment and placebo groups, but did report a 93%
increase in transfusion volume in 11 patients with
excessive bleeding (6-hour blood loss >750ml), 9
of whom received placebo.
4.1.2 comparisons with other agents

comparisons of  xxxd3410xxx  with other
agents have been carried out mainly in randomised
nonblind studies, although comparable efficacy to
 xxxd146xxx  and superiority over desmopressin have
been shown in placebo-controlled studies[39,41] (table iii). initial data analysis in one of these trials
suggested similar efficacy for  xxxd3410xxx  1
mg/kg/hour (after a loading dose of 10 mg/kg) and
desmopressin 0.3 mug/kg (before and after surgery)
in terms of proportions of patients who received
blood transfusions.[41] however, subsequent 2 × 2
analysis indicated that 8% of all patients who received  xxxd3410xxx  alone or  xxxd3410xxx 
with desmopressin and 21% of those receiving
desmopressin alone or placebo required transfusions (p = 0.024).
other comparisons have been carried out in a
nonblind fashion in small numbers of patients.
aprotinin has been the most common comparator,
administered intravenously usually as a loading
dose of 2.0 × 106 kallikrein inhibitory units (kiu)
with an infusion during surgery of 0.5 × 106 kiu.
in most studies, aprotinin was added to the cpb
circuit, usually in addition to a loading dose and
infusion (table iv). speekenbrink et al.[48] showed
 xxxd3410xxx  (10 mg/kg loading dose + 1 mg/kg/
hour) to be equivalent in efficacy to aprotinin
drugs 1999 jun; 57 (6)

 xxxd3410xxx : a review

(2 × 106 kiu) in terms of postoperative blood loss,
with both treatments being superior to the platelet
aggregation inhibitor  xxxd1914xxx . however, proportions of patients receiving allogeneic blood
transfusions were similar in all groups; in addition,
data were recorded for only 6 hours after surgery.
 xxxd3410xxx  and aprotinin were associated
with similar reductions in postoperative blood loss
(relative to untreated control patients) in 2 studies.[43,46] in one of these, reductions in transfusion
requirements of 43 and 60% for  xxxd3410xxx 
and aprotinin, respectively, were reported (p < 0.05
vs control group for both agents) [table iv].[46]
corbeau et al.[43] stated that the greater reduction
in 48-hour postoperative bleeding with aprotinin
seen in their study was accounted for by blood
losses in patients undergoing cabg (n = 55), with
no significant difference in patients undergoing
aortic valve replacement (n = 49). similar reductions in proportions of patients who needed blood
transfusions (38 to 42% vs control group) and
mean numbers of units transfused (53% vs control group) were seen in both active treatment
groups, although statistical significance versus
control was not attained. other reports showed
greater reductions in 24-hour postoperative blood
losses with aprotinin or  xxxd146xxx  than with  xxxd3410xxx .[14,44,45] however, in terms of statistical
significance between groups, transfusion data did
not match these findings in 2 studies,[14,45] and patient numbers were too small for definitive conclusions to be drawn in all three.
a meta-analysis of 60 randomised controlled
trials in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, of
which 12 assessed  xxxd3410xxx  (882 patients;
median sample size 47), 45 assessed aprotinin
(5808 patients), 12 assessed desmopressin (793 patients) and 3 assessed  xxxd146xxx  (118 patients), showed
 xxxd3410xxx  to be associated with a significant
decrease versus placebo or no treatment in the overall proportion of patients who required transfusion
of allogeneic blood [odds ratio (or) 0.50; 95%
confidence interval (ci) 0.34–0.76; p = 0.0009], as
was aprotinin (or 0.31; 95% ci 0.25–0.39; p <

the rationale for the use of antifibrinolytic drugs
in the management of bleeding from gastrointestinal lesions is based on observations of high local
levels of fibrinolytic enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract.[50] common causes of such bleeding include duodenal ulceration, gastric or duodenal erosion, varices, gastric ulceration, mallory-weiss
lesions, erosive oesophagitis and angioma.[1] despite improvements in diagnostic techniques, the
overall mortality rate from upper gastrointestinal
bleeding has changed little over past decades: an
investigation carried out in the early 1990s indicated that, of 2217 patients with haematemesis and
malaena, 8.5% died and 11% experienced rebleeding after initial treatment.[51] death was associated
with rebleeding, age over 60 years and the finding
of blood in the stomach at endoscopy.
drugs used in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding include antacids, histamine- xxxg1079xxx  antagonists and antifibrinolytic agents. survival is the most important measure of success with
any treatment in this condition: most deaths are
reported within 1 or 2 weeks of the initial bleed,
and benefit of therapy will therefore be apparent
after only short courses of treatment.[52]
reduction by  xxxd3410xxx  of blood transfusion requirements in patients with haemorrhage of
the stomach or duodenum was first reported in
1973,[53] and a small number of additional studies
has been conducted since that time (table v).
peptic ulceration or erosion was the predominant cause of bleeding, and diagnoses were made
with radiography and/or endoscopy. treatment
regimens varied, but patients received tranexamic
acid 4.5 to 6g daily for 5 to 7 days in most studies.
sex and age distributions were similar across the
studies, all of which were randomised and doubleblind.

reductions relative to placebo in rates of mortality after treatment with  xxxd3410xxx  ranged
from 5 to 54%, although most investigators had
randomised too few patients for definitive conclusions to be drawn. statistical significance in favour
of  xxxd3410xxx  was attained in the largest study,
however (6.3 vs 13.5%; p = 0.0092); a similar effect was noted for cimetidine (7.7 vs 13.5% with
placebo; p = 0.045).[54]
rates of rebleeding (or continued bleeding) after treatment were reduced substantially relative to
placebo in 2 studies (by 65%[56] and 40%[58]), but
statistical significance was not attained in either
case. in one of these trials,[56] rebleeding was analysed only if it was severe enough to warrant surgery; in others, rebleeding was defined as a fresh
haemorrhage or fall in haemoglobin levels after
admission.[54,58]  xxxd3410xxx  was associated
with statistically significant reductions in numbers
of patients requiring surgery in 2 studies,[56,58] and
with a nonsignificant reduction relative to placebo
of 47% in one other.[57] patients who received tran© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

examic acid appeared the most likely to undergo
surgery in the study of barer et al.;[54] however, the
differences between treatment groups were not statistically significant, and these patients were the
least likely to die after surgery (their postoperative
mortality rate was 31% of that in the placebo
group). it should be noted that criteria for surgery
were not clearly specified by most investigators,
but that the majority of operations were in patients
with severe continued or recurrent haemorrhage.
patients randomised to  xxxd3410xxx  in the study
of staël von holstein et al.[58] required statistically
significantly fewer units of transfused blood than
those randomised to placebo, and a substantial but
statistically nonsignificant reduction in the total
number of units transfused was reported by cormack et al.[53] (fig. 3).
meta-analysis of the above 6 studies showed
treatment with  xxxd3410xxx  to be associated
with a 20 to 30% reduction versus no treatment in
the rate of rebleeding, a 30 to 40% reduction in the
need for surgery and a 40% reduction in mortaldrugs 1999 jun; 57 (6)

ity.[52] the pooled odds ratio relative to placebo of
0.60 for mortality rates achieved statistical significance (p < 0.05) with each of 2 meta-analytical
methods (95% cis 0.40–0.89 and 0.39–0.90).
4.3 use in oral surgery

bleeding after oral surgical procedures can be
excessive, and is potentially hazardous in patients
with haemophilia and in those requiring long term
anticoagulant therapy, not least because the oral
mucosa and saliva are rich in plasminogen activators.[59] conventional prophylaxis and treatment
of excessive haemorrhage in dental patients with
haemophilia involves replacement therapy with
plasma concentrates of factor viii or  xxxg752xxx .[60]

patients taking anticoagulant medication (most
commonly for cardiac conditions) have their anticoagulant dosages reduced or discontinued (with
attendant increases in the risk of thromboembolic
complications) before oral surgery.[61] interest in
the use of antifibrinolytic therapy in these groups
of patients has been stimulated by the potential of
such treatment to reduce or eliminate the need for
transfused coagulation factors and to render unnecessary alterations in oral anticoagulant regimens,
particularly in the light of early data showing reductions in clotting factor concentrate requirements and days spent in hospital after tranexamic
acid and antibiotic therapy were added to treatment
schedules.[62]

three randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled studies have been carried out to assess the
effect of  xxxd3410xxx  on bleeding complications after oral surgery in patients with cardiac
conditions being managed with long term oral
anticoagulation therapy (table vi). two-minute
mouthwashes were used in preference to conventional oral therapy in all studies because systemic
administration of  xxxd3410xxx  does not result
in therapeutic drug concentrations in saliva[30] (section 3) and because plasma drug concentrations are
not clinically significant after mouthwash therapy.[30] whereas no attempt was made to adjust anticoagulant dosages or clotting times in 2 of these
studies,[64,65] anticoagulant therapy was stopped
and the international normalised ratio (inr) reduced from 3.0 to 4.5 to between 1.5 and 2.5 in
patients randomised to placebo in the other (with
blinding maintained for the operating oral surgeon).[63] aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) were not allowed for at least
2 weeks before surgery in 2 studies;[64,65] however,
these drugs were stated to have been excluded for
1 week after surgery only in the third.[63]
overall, proportions of patients with postoperative bleeding complications ranged from 0 to 6.7%
with  xxxd3410xxx  and from 13.3 to 40% with
placebo. additional data from a nonblind study in

regimens suggest that adjustment of anticoagulant
dosages and addition of heparin are unnecessary in
patients receiving  xxxd3410xxx  mouthwash after oral surgery.[61]
4.3.2 patients with haemophilia

five days’ treatment with  xxxd3410xxx  at an
oral dosage of 1g 3 times daily from 2 hours before
surgery (n = 14) was associated with a mean postoperative blood loss of 61.2ml in an early study in
patients with haemophilia.[66] this was statistically
significantly lower (p < 0.025) than the mean loss
of 84.1ml recorded in 14 patients who received placebo. plasma concentrates of factors viii and ix
equivalent to 1l of human plasma were given to all
patients 1 hour before dental extraction; the decision to transfuse additional factor viii or ix was
based on the clinician’s subjective assessment of
clinical need and not on specified criteria.  xxxd3410xxx  mouthwash was associated with a substantial decrease in the use of additional clotting
factors (14.3 vs 78.6% of patients who received
placebo), although statistical significance was not
stated.
statistically significant reductions with  xxxd3410xxx  mouthwash in rates of bleeding complications and clotting factor requirements were also reported in a nonblind study in 40 patients divided

into 3 treatment groups.[60] two groups received
high doses of factor concentrate (groups a and b)
and the third (group c) received low doses only (to
bring plasma clotting factor levels to approximately 10% of normal values). all patients also
received systemic therapy with  xxxd3410xxx 
(37 to 103 mg/kg/day), but mouthwash (5% w/v 4
times daily) was also used in groups b and c only.
there were no bleeding complications after oral
surgery in group b (p < 0.05 vs group a), and the
mean quantity of clotting factor concentrates
needed in group c was lower than that required for
group a or b (p < 0.01).
4.4 use in other types of surgery

clinical benefit of  xxxd3410xxx  in terms of
reduction of perioperative blood loss and transfusion requirements has been assessed in numerous
studies in patients undergoing surgery associated
with high levels of perioperative bleeding. of
particular interest are orthopaedic surgery, liver
transplantation and procedures involving the urinary tract.

activity and subsequent increases in postoperative
blood loss.[67] table vii shows details and results
of 2 well designed clinical studies in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty, both of which
showed substantial and statistically significant reductions (57 and 65.9%) versus placebo in mean
postoperative blood loss after perioperative  xxxd3410xxx  therapy. significant reductions in
transfusion requirements were also recorded (table
vii). these results confirmed earlier observations
in 29 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.[70] in one of the studies,[69] 15 patients in the
placebo group were given  xxxd3410xxx  in an
attempt to control heavy bleeding after surgery.
subsequent reductions in blood loss were minimal, however, and the authors concluded that the
drug has little effect when used under these circumstances.
4.4.2 orthotopic liver transplantation

patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation experience extensive bleeding, the surgical
causes of which include portal hypertension, transection of the numerous collateral channels, fragility of the tissues involved and the complexity and
duration of this major vascular procedure.[71] in

addition, the coagulation system undergoes profound changes, including dilutional coagulopathy
before removal of the liver and further deterioration (caused by the absence of the normal hepatic
synthetic and clearance mechanisms) during the
anhepatic phase, during this type of surgery.[71]
one randomised, double-blind and placebocontrolled study has shown clinical benefit with
 xxxd3410xxx  (intravenous infusion of 40 mg/kg/
hour to a maximum dose of 20g) in patients undergoing primary isolated orthotopic liver transplantation (fig. 4).[72] exclusion criteria included primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing
cholangitis (both of which carry increased risk of
major surgical blood loss) and budd-chiari syndrome (because of its association with increased
rates of thrombosis). veno-venous bypass was
used in 40% of patients on  xxxd3410xxx  and
35% of those who received placebo, and all patients received  xxxd1914xxx  and heparin for 24
hours after completion of hepatic arterial anastomosis. no episodes of hepatic artery or portal vein
thrombosis were reported within 1 month of surgery, and there were no significant differences be-

 xxxd3410xxx  was found not to have any significant beneficial effect in another double-blind
placebo-controlled study.[73] however, in this trial
in 32 patients, a much lower dosage of the drug (2
mg/kg/hour) than that used in the previously described study[72] was given. in addition, results
from a nonblind study in 20 patients showed intravenous  xxxd3410xxx  (10 mg/kg at the anhepatic
stage of surgery and 3 mg/kg/hour thereafter until
transfer to the intensive care unit) to be associated
with a decrease in mean (± standard deviation) intraoperative blood loss (from 12 594 ± 11 911ml in

the control group to 6042 ± 3949ml with active
treatment; p < 0.05).[74]
4.4.3 urinary tract surgery

urine and the mucosa of the urinary tract are
rich in plasminogen activators which facilitate the
lysis of blood clots. in particular, urine dissolves
clots in the prostatic cavity of patients who have
undergone prostatectomy; this results in haematuria and sometimes in anaemia.[59] early randomised double-blind studies in men undergoing prostatectomy showed significant reductions in urinary
blood loss when  xxxd3410xxx  1.5 to 3g daily
was given for 3 days after surgery.[75,76]
a randomised study in 100 men, 92 of whom
underwent transurethral resection of the prostate
gland (turp) and 8 of whom underwent endoscopic prostatic tumour resection, showed the 4week incidence of secondary haemorrhage to be
24% in patients treated with  xxxd3410xxx  (1g
3 times daily orally for 3 weeks after surgery) and
56% in patients who received no antifibrinolytic
therapy (p < 0.01 between groups). none of the
patients who received  xxxd3410xxx  and 4 of
those who did not receive the drug were readmitted
to hospital for treatment of bleeding complications,
although this difference between groups was not
statistically significant. an earlier study appeared
to show no significant effect of  xxxd3410xxx  (1g
by intravenous infusion plus 1g orally 3 times daily
for 7 days) on postoperative bleeding in patients
who underwent transvesical prostatic adenomectomy.[77] however, only 10 patients received the
drug in this 7-day trial (in which the antifibrinolytic efficacy of  xxxd3410xxx  was compared
with that of bothrops jararaca venom).
4.5 use in gynaecology
4.5.1 menorrhagia

menorrhagia, or excessive menstrual bleeding,
is a common condition among women, approximately 19% of whom consider their menstruation
to be heavy (reviewed by liddell[78]). although it
is a subjective complaint (women who present with
this condition can base their assessment only on
their own experience and perception of a ‘normal’
drugs 1999 jun; 57 (6)

 xxxd3410xxx : a review

period), the condition is distressing and potentially
disabling. the term ‘menorrhagia’ encompasses
both heavy bleeding associated with uterine disorders and dysfunctional uterine bleeding with no
apparent underlying pelvic disease.
analysis of population studies has indicated
that the median volume of blood lost during a normal period is approximately 30ml, with menorrhagia being diagnosed when the total loss is in excess
of 80ml (reviewed by higham and shaw[79]). menstrual blood losses of 50 to 60ml are associated
with negative iron balance, and iron deficiency
anaemia is diagnosed in 67% of women who lose
in excess of 80ml. in addition, 60 to 70% of women
with menorrhagia also present with dysmenorrhoea; women so affected experience a particularly
debilitating combination of symptoms.[78]
menorrhagia can be acute or chronic, and in
80% of cases is associated with the ovulatory
cycle. treatment options fall into 3 categories:
medical therapy, transcervical endometrial resection or hysterectomy. as surgery carries a significant risk of morbidity, various medical treatments
have been advocated as potentially desirable and
effective alternatives. these include antifibrinolytic agents, prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors, oral
contraceptives and intra-uterine progestogens.[80]
the preferred clinical end-point in the assessment
of these treatments is reduction in menstrual blood
volume, measured objectively with an accurate
procedure such as the alkaline haematin method of
hallberg and nilsson.[81]
clinical studies of  xxxd3410xxx  therapy in
women with menorrhagia have involved only small
numbers of patients and have been of variable design, but results to date have been consistent (table
viii). women with idiopathic menorrhagia were
selected after gynaecological examination in all 5
studies, and mean menstrual blood loss at baseline
was stated to be in excess of 80 ml/cycle in
four.[80,82,84,85] the alkaline haematin method was
used to estimate menstrual losses in all trials except
one,[83] in which the oxford total body counter
method was used.

1023

reductions of 34 to 57.9% versus placebo or
control groups in mean menstrual blood loss were
achieved over 2 to 3 cycles of oral treatment with
 xxxd3410xxx  2 to 4.5 g/day in the studies
summarised in table viii. in addition, the drug was
shown to be at least as effective as nsaid therapy[80,82] and more effective than the haemostatic
agent etamsylate[82] or cyclical administration of
 xxxd2751xxx [85] in the treatment of ovulatory
menorrhagia. in the double-blind study of preston
et al.,[85] 56% of patients who received tranexamic
acid achieved a menstrual blood loss of less than
80 ml/cycle after 2 months’ treatment (despite mean
pre-treatment losses of 175 ml/cycle), whereas
only 9.5% of those who received  xxxd2751xxx 
did so (mean pre-treatment loss of 173 ml/cycle).
in addition, bonnar and sheppard[82] stated that 19,
13 and 4%, respectively, of patients who received
 xxxd3410xxx ,  xxxd2556xxx  acid or etamsylate reported concurrent improvements in symptoms of
dysmenorrhoea. of the 27 patients who received
etamsylate, 67% expressed a desire to stop treatment after the trial, whereas 77% of patients receiving  xxxd3410xxx  and 74% of those receiving  xxxd2556xxx  acid wished to continue. very large
reductions in menstrual blood loss were achieved
with intra-uterine administration of levonorgestrel
in 1 study (of the 3 treatment groups, this was the
only one in which the mean menstrual loss was
reduced to <80 ml/cycle); however, 7 of the 16
women so treated developed amenorrhoea after up
to 12 months’ treatment.[80]
4.5.2 bleeding associated with pregnancy

bleeding during pregnancy is associated with a
3- to 4-fold increase in perinatal mortality.[86]
fibrin is known to be an important structural component of uteroplacental blood vessels, and fibrinolytic activity is inhibited in the vicinity of trophoblast cells in the terminal sections of the spiral
arteries.[87,88] placental bleeding appears to result
from structural weakness of and vascular defects
in placental blood vessels. placental abruption (abruptio placentae) is characterised by activation of
the fibrinolytic system,[89] and  xxxd3410xxx  has
been used to secure local haemostasis and to reduce

the risk of premature labour as the drug is known
to cross the placental barrier (section 3).
seventy three consecutive patients with placental abruption were treated with  xxxd3410xxx 
before caesarian section.[89] of these, 67 received
1g of the drug intravenously immediately before
delivery and 6 in early pregnancy with less pronounced symptoms received oral treatment with 4g
daily until delivery. perinatal mortality in this series of women was 8%, and there were no cases of
haemorrhagic diathesis or thrombosis and no maternal deaths.
twelve live births (8 by normal vaginal delivery) were reported in a series of 12 women with
vaginal bleeding in the second half of pregnancy
who received  xxxd3410xxx  at an oral dosage of
1g 3 times daily orally for 7 days.[29] tranexamic
acid was also used to good effect in a woman with

central placenta praevia who presented as an obstetric emergency with very heavy vaginal bleeding.[90] after transection of the placenta to deliver
a live infant, bleeding was controlled with a total
intravenous dose of  xxxd3410xxx  of 3g infused
over a 24-hour period. the authors suggested that
intravenous therapy with  xxxd3410xxx  should
be considered before surgical options in patients
with persistent postpartum haemorrhage.
4.5.3 conisation of the cervix

this procedure is used in the management of
noninvasive cancer of the cervix. postoperative
bleeding requiring additional treatment is seen in
approximately 14% of patients when open surgery
without suturing is used.[91] the use of antifibrinolytic agents is logical in these patients because cervical tissue contains high levels of plasminogen activator. results of a double-blind,

 xxxd3410xxx : a review

placebo-controlled study with open surgical technique in 45 patients showed a significant (mean
71%; p < 0.05) reduction in postoperative blood
loss in those who received  xxxd3410xxx  at an
oral dosage of 1.5g 3 times daily for 12 days after
surgery.[92] in another double-blind study, 1 of 38
women who received  xxxd3410xxx  4.5 g/day
orally and 4 of 37 who received placebo for 13 days
after cervical conisation with suturing experienced
late bleeding.[93] the difference between groups
was not statistically significant.
4.6 other indications
4.6.1 ocular trauma

the iris and choroid carry high endothelial
levels of plasminogen tissue activator, whereas
the aqueous humour in the anterior segment of the
eye has a diluent effect on blood after intraocular
haemorrhage. intraocular blood usually coagulates, and dissolution of the clot is necessary for
its reabsorption. however, intraocular fibrinolysis
may dissolve fibrin clots sealing damaged blood
vessels and thus cause secondary bleeding (reviewed by verstraete[86]). this, the most serious
complication of traumatic hyphaema, is usually
observed 2 to 7 days after ocular injury and may
cause impaired vision or blindness.
results from 2 controlled trials showed that
 xxxd3410xxx  1g or 25 mg/kg 3 times daily orally
significantly reduces the frequency of secondary
ocular haemorrhage.[94,95] more recently, clinical
benefit of  xxxd3410xxx  was reported in a case
series of 340 children with nonperforating traumatic hyphaema, 121 of whom received the drug
(dosage not specified).[96] there was no rebleeding
in 26 patients who were confined to bed, and only
1 episode (1.1%) in 95 who were allowed free ambulation in hospital; this was statistically significant (p < 0.01) compared with the 9.6% rate of
secondary haemorrhage in children treated with
bed rest and no antifibrinolytic therapy.[96] furthermore, in a randomised nonblind study in patients
aged 6 to 47 years with nonperforating traumatic
hyphaema,  xxxd3410xxx  25 mg/kg/day orally
for 6 days was associated with a 3.6% rate of sec© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

1025

ondary haemorrhage in 28 individuals.[97] this was
statistically significantly better (p < 0.01) than the
rate of 33.3% seen in 27 patients who received conservative treatment only.
4.6.2 hereditary angioneurotic oedema

this condition is characterised by recurrent, circumscribed and non-pitting subepithelial oedema
that can involve any part of the body. the skin and
mucosa of the gastrointestinal and upper respiratory tracts may be affected, with resultant acute
attacks of abdominal pain and risk of asphyxiation.
hereditary angioneurotic oedema is carried in an
autosomal dominant fashion, and symptoms are
caused by a deficiency of  xxxg281xxx  inhibitor that
leads to uncontrolled activation of the complement
system and overproduction of fragments, many of
which have vasoactive properties. in addition, c1esterase inhibitor impedes the action of kallikrein
on kininogen conversion and neutralises plasmin
(reviewed by verstraete[86] and sim and grant[98]).
the rationale behind the use of antifibrinolytic
agents in hereditary angioneurotic oedema lies in
the counteracting effect of these drugs on the continuous activation of contact and fibrinolytic systems.[99] results of 2 randomised, double-blind
crossover trials carried out in the early 1970s
showed a reduction in the number and severity of
attacks of oedema in patients treated with  xxxd3410xxx , although benefit was not obtained in all
patients who received the drug.[100,101] the reasons
for this remain unclear. further data from a case
series of 7 finnish patients showed clinical benefit
in 6 of these individuals after oral treatment with
 xxxd3410xxx  1.5g 3 times daily.[102] greatest
efficacy was reported when the drug was taken at
the onset of an attack, and 2 of 3 patients who received continuous therapy (1g 2 to 3 times daily)
remained almost symptom-free for the duration of
treatment.
4.6.3 subarachnoid haemorrhage

rupture of an intracranial aneurysm results
principally in bleeding into the subarachnoid space
and subsequent brain damage due to destruction of
brain parenchyma, increased intracranial pressure,
brain shift and herniation, and hydrocephalus.
drugs 1999 jun; 57 (6)

1026

around 15% of patients die instantly; those who
survive have a 20% risk of rebleeding and developing delayed ischaemic cerebral deficits.[86,103]
rebleeding has been attributed to fibrinolysis of
the blood clot around the fundus of the aneurysm,
and antifibrinolytic therapy has been used to increase the durability of this clot.
a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind
study in 479 patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage showed a significant (p < 0.001) reduction in
the rate of rebleeding (from 24% in placebo-treated
patients to 9% in those who received intravenous
 xxxd3410xxx  6 g/day for the first week and 4
g/day thereafter for up to 4 weeks, with some patients receiving oral therapy at a dosage of 6 g/day
for the third and fourth weeks).[104] treatment was
started within 72 hours of haemorrhage in all patients. overall outcome was not improved after 3
months, however, because of an increase in the incidence of cerebral ischaemia (15% in the placebotreated group vs 24% in patients who received active treatment). findings of other studies published
during the 1970s and early 1980s[105-112] have been
inconsistent in terms of clinical benefit of  xxxd3410xxx  in these patients.
in an analysis of 672 patients participating in the
international cooperative study on the timing of
aneurysm surgery, in which patients who received
antifibrinolytic therapy ( xxxd3410xxx  or  xxxd146xxx )
and those who did not were compared, inhibition
of fibrinolysis was associated with a significant
reduction in the rate of rebleeding (11.7 vs 19.4%;
p = 0.01).[113] however, significant increases in
rates of ischaemic deficit (32.4 vs 22.7%; p = 0.01)
and hydrocephalus (13.5 vs 6.8%; p = 0.02) were
also reported.
5. tolerability
adverse events with  xxxd3410xxx  therapy are
uncommon; nausea or diarrhoea and, occasionally,
orthostatic reactions are most often reported.[86]
there is a theoretical risk of increased thrombotic
tendency during treatment with inhibitors of fibrinolysis, and there have been isolated case reports
of cerebral thrombosis,[114,115] arterial thrombo© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

dunn & goa

sis,[116] acute renal failure[117,118] and coronary graft
occlusion[119] in patients receiving  xxxd3410xxx .
however, these observations have not been confirmed by the results of controlled clinical studies;
indeed, several randomised studies in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cpb have shown no
excess incidence of thrombotic events in patients
receiving the drug.[12,37,41,48] furthermore, similar
rates of thromboembolic complications were reported for placebo and  xxxd3410xxx  in both trials conducted in patients undergoing total knee
arthroplasty.[68,69] however, the incidence of cerebral ischaemia was higher in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage given  xxxd3410xxx 
than in placebo recipients (section 4.6.3).
no thrombogenic effect of  xxxd3410xxx  was
detected in a retrospective analysis of case records
of 256 women with bleeding disorders in pregnancy, 168 of whom underwent caesarian section.[120] these findings are particularly significant
because pregnant women have low fibrinolytic
capacity and an increased risk of thrombosis (especially after caesarian section).
although atrophy of the retinal rod and cone
layers has been reported after 1 year’s oral administration of  xxxd3410xxx  in dogs, the dosages
used were of the order of 7 times those recommended in humans.[121] moreover, no retinal changes
were found in patients who received the drug at
therapeutic dosages for periods ranging from 15
months to 8 years.[122] as instances of disturbance
in colour vision have been reported, it is nevertheless recommended that treatment with tranexamic
acid should be withdrawn from any patients who
develop this symptom.[123]
no mutagenic activity of  xxxd3410xxx  has
been detected in in vitro and in vivo test systems,[121,124] and no fetal abnormalities were identified in early dysmorphology and reproductive
studies in animals.[125,126]
6. dosage and administration
although  xxxd3410xxx  has been studied in a
number of clinical settings, the uses for which the
drug is approved vary between countries. the foldrugs 1999 jun; 57 (6)

 xxxd3410xxx : a review

lowing recommendations therefore include dosages recommended by the manufacturer and regimens most frequently used by clinical investigators.  xxxd3410xxx  is available in 500 mg/5ml
ampoules for intravenous use, and as a syrup containing 500mg in 5ml and 500mg tablets for oral
administration. for local fibrinolysis the recommended dosage is 500mg to 1g by slow intravenous injection 3 times daily or 1 to 1.5g orally 2 to
3 times daily.[123] in general fibrinolysis, a single
dose of 1g or 10 mg/kg by slow intravenous injection is recommended.[123] dosages in children
should be calculated according to bodyweight at
25 mg/kg/dose.[123] other dosages for specific indications are as follows:
cardiac surgery with cpb: although there is no
officially recommended regimen for this indication, an initial intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg given
over 20 to 30 minutes before surgery and followed
by an infusion of 1 mg/kg/hour during cpb has
been used most frequently in clinical studies. additional benefit does not appear to be obtained with
higher dosages[12] (see section 4.1.1).
upper gastrointestinal bleeding: a daily dosage
of 4.5 to 6g daily, divided into 3 to 6 doses, for 5
to 7 days has been most commonly used in these
patients.  xxxd3410xxx  was administered intravenously for the first 2 to 3 days in the majority
of clinical studies summarised in section 4.2, with
oral therapy being used thereafter.
oral surgery: 1 to 1.5g orally every 8 hours in
patients with haemophilia (dosage based on 25
mg/kg 3 times daily). a 4.8 to 5% w/v mouthwash
for 2 minutes 4 times daily for 7 days after surgery
has been most frequently used in patients receiving
oral anticoagulants (section 4.3.1).
other surgery: 10 to 15 mg/kg by intravenous
infusion before release of tourniquet, with 1 or 2
further doses at 3-hour intervals if necessary, may
be used in knee arthroplasty. intravenous infusion
of 40 mg/kg/hour to a maximum dose of 20g has
been used in patients undergoing orthotopic liver
transplantation (section 4.4.2). perioperative therapy with 500mg to 1g 3 times daily intravenously,
then oral treatment with 1g 3 to 4 times daily, may

be used in patients undergoing prostatectomy.
patients undergoing transurethral surgery have received 6 or 12g daily for 4 days around the time of
surgery (section 4.4.3).
gynaecological indications: 1 to 1.5g 3 to 4
times daily orally for 3 to 4 days is recommended
in menorrhagia. patients undergoing conisation of
the cervix may be managed with 1.5g orally 3 times
daily.
other indications: 1 to 1.5g orally 3 times daily
may be used in patients with traumatic hyphaema.
oral therapy with 1.5g 3 times daily is recommended in patients with hereditary angioneurotic
oedema.
 xxxd3410xxx  is contraindicated in patients
with a history of thromboembolic disease, and dosage reductions are recommended in patients with
renal insufficiency.[123] haemorrhage due to disseminated intravascular coagulation should not be
treated with any antifibrinolytic agent unless both
bleeding tendency and systemic fibrinogenolysis
are present;[127] in such cases, careful monitoring
and anticoagulant cover are also required.[128]
7. place of  xxxd3410xxx  in
surgery and other indications
since its introduction into clinical practice over
30 years ago,  xxxd3410xxx  has been used for a
wide variety of clinical conditions in which antifibrinolytic therapy has been deemed potentially
beneficial. the use of the drug is made more attractive in many patients by its ability to inhibit fibrinolysis while having no apparent effect on blood
clotting parameters.
much recently published literature on  xxxd3410xxx  and other antifibrinolytic agents has dealt
with the use of these drugs in patients undergoing
cardiac surgery with cpb, and clinical opinion
on the relative merits of these drugs is divided.[31,36,129]  xxxd3410xxx  has greater antifibrinolytic activity than  xxxd146xxx [86] and is at least
as effective. results of 1 study only showed greater
efficacy of  xxxd146xxx : [45] this conclusion was based
on a statistical analysis that showed patients who
received  xxxd146xxx , but not those who received trandrugs 1999 jun; 57 (6)

1028

examic acid, to have lost significantly less blood
after 24 hours than those who received no antifibrinolytic therapy. however, as mean blood
losses were 534 and 509ml with  xxxd3410xxx 
and  xxxd146xxx , respectively, the clinical significance
of this finding is questionable (particularly as a
smaller proportion of  xxxd3410xxx  than  xxxd146xxx 
patients required postoperative transfusions).
several commentators have expressed a preference for aprotinin over  xxxd3410xxx  on the basis
of extensive clinical experience and consistent
clinical benefit with the former.[36,86,129] however,
other reviewers[31,33] have pointed out that clinical
studies have failed to show any consistent superiority of aprotinin over  xxxd3410xxx , and that
both drugs reduce blood loss after cardiac surgery.
other factors that influence outcomes in studies
of patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cpb
include the expertise of the surgeon, the use of normothermic cpb and variation of and adherence to
transfusion criteria.[34] such considerations are
likely to affect the extent of use of antifibrinolytic
therapy in different institutions. however, costbenefit analysis of pharmacological haemostasis
has indicated that the use of such therapy results in
indirect cost savings from reductions in operating
theatre time and reduced lengths of stay in intensive care units and surgical wards.[130] although no
such analysis of patients receiving  xxxd3410xxx 
specifically has been carried out, several authors
have pointed out that the acquisition cost of the
drug is considerably lower than that of aprotinin,
and that its use circumvents any risk of allergic
reactions or sensitisation.[31,33,46]
the use of antifibrinolytic drugs is of interest in
patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding because these agents tend to be inexpensive, are usually well tolerated and could potentially be given
to the majority of patients (including the many who
are not cared for by specialist physicians). [52]
despite its apparent efficacy in these patients,
 xxxd3410xxx  is not used widely to treat patients
with upper gastrointestinal bleeding because of the
efficacy of other medical and endoscopic treatments.[59] nevertheless, clinical benefit (including

reductions in mortality rates) of  xxxd3410xxx 
has been shown in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and controlled comparisons with
other antifibrinolytic drugs and medical interventions are now necessary to clarify the overall place
of the drug in the management of this condition.
the demonstration of increased uterine fibrinolytic activity in menorrhagia underlines the potential utility of antifibrinolytic therapy in this condition.[18]  xxxd3410xxx  is superior in terms of
reduction of menstrual blood loss to etamsylate or
cyclical therapy with  xxxd2751xxx , and is at least
as effective as nsaids. endometrial suppression
with a progestogen introduced into the uterus via
an intrauterine device is highly effective in the
management of menorrhagia, and is likely to be
preferable to hysterectomy in many patients. however, there is a risk of pelvic inflammation associated with intrauterine devices, and some women
develop amenorrhoea with this treatment. [131,132]
combined oral contraceptives are also effective in
the management of menorrhagia, and they offer the
additional advantage of providing reliable contraception to those who require it. however, 30 to
40% of patients experience adverse effects that include headaches, weight change, breast tenderness,
nausea, vomiting, mood changes, hypertension and
thromboses.[79] clinical studies comparing the efficacy and tolerability of combined oral contraception and  xxxd3410xxx  in women with menorrhagia have not been carried out to date.
although results from controlled clinical trials
are not available, case series and reports indicate
that  xxxd3410xxx  can be used successfully to
control bleeding in patients with placental abruption or postpartum haemorrhage.  xxxd3410xxx 
therapy has also been shown to reduce excessive
blood loss after conisation of the cervix.
inhibition of fibrinolysis is effective in the prevention of excessive bleeding after oral surgery in
patients with haemophilia and those receiving oral
anticoagulant therapy. in particular, data from well
designed studies have shown clearly the efficacy of
mouthwash formulations of  xxxd3410xxx  in
dental patients being treated with oral anticoagudrugs 1999 jun; 57 (6)

 xxxd3410xxx : a review

lants for cardiac indications. a major advantage of
this treatment is that it eliminates the need for adjustment or discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment around the time of dental treatment.
significant reductions after  xxxd3410xxx 
therapy in postoperative blood losses and transfusion requirements have also been observed in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty, although
the need for transfusions was not eliminated.
limited evidence to date suggests that early and
aggressive treatment of fibrinolysis is beneficial in
patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation, and that reductions in perioperative blood loss
and transfusion requirements are obtained when
 xxxd3410xxx  is used in these patients. however,
current opinion states that antifibrinolytic agents
should be given in orthotopic liver transplantation
only when fibrinolysis is demonstrated objectively
(preferably by thromboelastography).[71]  xxxd3410xxx  also reduces blood losses in patients
undergoing prostatic surgery and reduces the incidence of secondary bleeding after traumatic
hyphaema, although only small numbers of studies, or data from case series only, are available for
these indications.
the place of  xxxd3410xxx  and fibrinolytic
agents in general in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage is questionable. prevention of rebleeding
with early surgery has been stated to be the most
effective treatment option, and antifibrinolytic therapy is unlikely to be useful in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage until means of minimising ischaemic complications have been developed.[103]
in conclusion,  xxxd3410xxx  has been shown
during its long clinical history to be useful in patients with a broad range of haemorrhagic conditions, particularly when bleeding from mucosal
sites is involved, and to have a good tolerability
profile. its efficacy in reducing postoperative
blood losses and transfusion requirements make
 xxxd3410xxx  a useful adjunct to a number of
types of surgery, and the drug appears to reduce
rates of mortality and the need for urgent surgery
in patients with upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage.  xxxd3410xxx  may also have cost and tol© adis international limited. all rights reserved.
