activation of ␮-opioid receptors (mors) underlies the rewarding and analgesic effects of morphine; however, the efficacy of morphine is limited by rapidly developing tolerance
to the drug (inoue and ueda, 2000). the mechanisms underlying tolerance are poorly understood, but it is clear that in
some systems morphine causes greater tolerance than other
higher efficacy mor agonists, such as  xxxd2070xxx  and fentanyl
(duttaroy and yoburn, 1995). in addition, compared with full
this work was supported by the wellcome trust.

phorylation over basal. the pkc inhibitor  xxxd2195xxx  1
( xxxd2195xxx ) inhibited mor1 phosphorylation under basal
conditions and in the presence of morphine, but it did not inhibit
damgo-induced phosphorylation. damgo induced arrestin-2
translocation to the plasma membrane and considerable mor1
internalization, whereas morphine did not induce arrestin-2
translocation and induced very little mor1 internalization.
thus, damgo and morphine each induce desensitization of
mor1 signaling in hek293 cells but by different molecular
mechanisms; damgo-induced desensitization is  xxxg970xxx -dependent, whereas morphine-induced desensitization is in part
pkc-dependent. mors desensitized by damgo activation are
then readily internalized by an arrestin-dependent mechanism,
whereas those desensitized by morphine are not. these data
suggest that opioid agonists induce different conformations of
the mor that are susceptible to different desensitizing and
internalization processes.

agonists, morphine produces little loss of cell surface mors
by internalization (keith et al., 1996). these findings have
been interpreted in different ways to explain the phenomenon of tolerance (for review, see connor et al., 2004; bailey
and connor, 2005). on the one hand, it has been suggested
that morphine, because it does not trigger significant mor
internalization, allows the receptor to couple over a prolonged period to intracellular signaling systems that induce
marked tolerance (finn and whistler, 2001). on the other
hand, it has been suggested that the poor ability of mors to
internalize in response to morphine means that morphinedesensitized receptors accumulate at or near the cell surface.
this implies that internalization is a crucial first step in
resensitization, followed by dephosphorylation and recycling
back to the plasma membrane; thus, tolerance may be exac-

abstract
the ability of two opioid agonists, [d-ala2,n-me-phe4,gly5-ol]enkephalin (damgo) and morphine, to induce ␮-opioid receptor (mor) phosphorylation, desensitization, and internalization
was examined in human embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells
expressing rat mor1 as well g protein-coupled inwardly rectifying  xxxg1232xxx  (girk) channel subunits. both
damgo and morphine activated girk currents, but the maximum response to damgo was greater than that of morphine,
indicating that morphine is a partial agonist. the responses to
damgo and morphine desensitized rapidly in the presence of
either drug. expression of a dominant negative mutant  xxxg970xxx  ( xxxg970xxx ),  xxxg970xxx -k220r, markedly attenuated the damgo-induced desensitization of mor1,
but it had no effect on morphine-induced mor1 desensitization. in contrast, inhibition of protein kinase c (pkc) either by
the pkc inhibitory peptide pkc (19-31) or  xxxd3241xxx  reduced mor1 desensitization by morphine but not that induced
by damgo. morphine and damgo enhanced mor1 phos-

mechanism of mor desensitization is agonist-dependent

materials and methods
hek293 cells stably expressing mor1. hek293 cells stably
expressing t7-epitope-tagged mor1 have been described previously
(bailey et al., 2003). for the electrophysiological experiments,
[35s]gtp␥s assays, mor1 internalization, and arrestin translocation studies, we used a stable cell line (hek293-mor1) with a
mor1 expression level of 175 ⫾ 28 fmol/mg of protein (as assessed by
[3h] xxxd1913xxx  saturation binding). this level of expression approximates to that found in mature brain neurons (tempel and
zukin, 1987). for the mor1 phosphorylation studies, we used an
hek293-mor1 cell line with a higher mor1 expression level of
1627 ⫾ 41 fmol/mg of protein. cells were maintained at 37°c in 95%
o2, 5% co2, in dmem, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
10 u/ml penicillin, and 10 mg/ml streptomycin; for the hek293mor1 cells, 250 ␮g/ml  xxxg418xxx  ( xxxd2191xxx ) was also added to the
culture medium. for transient transfections, cells were plated out at
⬃50% confluence on glass coverslips in 24-well plates and were
transfected with 0.3 to 0.5 ␮g of cdna using calcium phosphate
precipitation. for transient transfections, cdnas were inserted into
pcdna3 (dominant negative mutants of  xxxg970xxx  and grk6) or
pegfp-n (arrestin2-gfp and arrestin3-gfp). plasmid dna was
diluted in sterile water, and 2.5 m cacl2 was added to a final
concentration of 0.25 m cacl2. the mixture was then combined 1:1
with hepes-buffered saline (280 mm nacl, 10 mm kcl, 1.5 mm
na2hpo4, 12 mm glucose, and 50 mm hepes, adjusted to ph 6.9
using 1 m naoh) and added to each well of the plate. cells were then
incubated for 16 to 24 h before use.
whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. nonconfluent monolayers of hek293-mor1 cells grown on glass coverslips were mounted
in a perfusion chamber (1.9 ml) on an inverted phase contrast microscope also equipped for visualization of green fluorescent protein
(gfp) fluorescence (nikon, tokyo, japan) and superfused (4 ml/min)
with extracellular solution at room temperature (22–26°c). the extracellular solution contained 160 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 2 mm

cacl2, 1 mm mgcl2, 11 mm glucose, and 5 mm hepes, ph 7.4. cells
that had been successfully transfected with the  xxxg1252xxx  and  xxxg1254xxx 
subunits were identified by their gfp fluorescence. whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings (vh ⫽ ⫺60 mv) were made using electrodes
(3–5 m⍀) filled with 122 mm kcl, 11 mm egta, 1 mm cacl2, 2 mm
mgcl2, 10 mm hepes, 4 mm mgatp, 0.25 mm na2gtp, and 5 mm
nacl, ph 7.2. recordings were filtered at 2 khz using an axopatch
200b amplifier (molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca) and saved to a
computer for subsequent analysis. all drugs were applied in known
concentrations in the superfusing solution.
to enhance the amplitude of the mor1-evoked girk currents, we
recorded inward current through these inwardly rectifying channels
(fig. 1). the k⫹ concentration of the extracellular bathing solution
was raised to 50 mm and the nacl concentration reduced to 115 mm.
furthermore, to ensure that currents evoked by prolonged exposure
to agonists did not decline because of the inward current raising the
intracellular k⫹ concentration, thereby reducing the electrochemical
drive for further entry of k⫹ into the cell, we developed a voltage
protocol that minimized the amount of k⫹ entry into the cell during
the application of the drug. cells were initially held at a membrane
potential of ⫺60 mv, and when the buffer was changed from low [k⫹]
to high [k⫹], the membrane potential was stepped to ⫺25 mv, which
is the reversal potential for the girk channel under these recording
conditions (i.e., the potential at which no k⫹ ions would flow into or
out of the cell). to measure girk channel activation in response to
morphine or damgo, the membrane potential was then stepped
from ⫺25 to ⫺60 mv for only 60 ms every 5 s. in this way, the current
response to an agonist could be measured, whereas the amount of k⫹
that entered the cell during a recording was minimized. barium (1
mm), a blocker of kir channels, abolished the damgo- and morphine-evoked currents. no opioid-evoked current was observed in
hek293-mor1 cells that were not transfected with  xxxg1252xxx  and
 xxxg1254xxx  subunits.
desensitization of the mor1-evoked girk current was quantified
by expressing the current amplitude as a percentage of the initial
peak current. the decay of the current was fitted to a single exponential using prism software (graphpad software inc., san diego,
ca).
[35s]gtp␥s assay. the binding of [35s]gtp␥s to membranes of
mor1-expressing cells was based on the assay described previously
(harrison and traynor, 2003). in brief, cells were incubated in the
presence or absence of agonist for 30 min, washed, and then the cells
were resuspended in ice-cold assay buffer (0.2 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 0.38 mm
kh2po4, and 0.61 mm na2hpo4, ph 7.4) and lysed in a hand-held
homogenizer. the homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000g for 20
min at 4°c, and the pellets were resuspended in 50 mm tris-hcl
buffer, ph 7.4. aliquots of membrane (⬃30 ␮g of protein) were then
incubated with 200 pm [35s]gtp␥s and assay buffer containing 3
␮m gdp and damgo/morphine as indicated (final volume 400 ␮l)
for 1 h at room temperature. nonspecific binding in all cases was
determined by the addition of 10 ␮m gtp␥s to the assay. binding
was stopped by the addition of 2 ml of ice-cold 50 mm tris-hcl
buffer, ph 7.4, and the samples were rapidly filtered through glass
fiber filters using a brandel cell harvester, using 50 mm tris-hcl
buffer, ph 7.4, as filtering buffer. the amount of [35s]gtp␥s bound
to membranes on individual filters was then determined by liquid
scintillation counting.
mor1 phosphorylation. hek293-mor1 cells were incubated
with [32p]orthophosphate (0.15 mci/ml) in phosphate-free dmem
for 2 h. after exposure to opioid agonists, cells were scraped into
ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5, 120 mm nacl, 1%
triton x-100, 40 mm ␤-glycerophosphate, 1 mm edta, 0.1 ␮m
microcystin, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor
cocktail), nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation, and
mor1 was immunoprecipitated with 1 ␮g of t7-tag monoclonal
antibody (novagen, nottingham, uk) and 20 ␮l of a 50% slurry of
protein a-sepharose. immunoprecipitates were washed three times
in lysis buffer and subjected to sds-page. the intensity of the

erbated when desensitized receptors cannot internalize and
resensitize (schulz et al., 2004). further evidence for the
latter view comes from a very recent study showing that in
comparison with full mor agonists such as damgo, morphine caused a greater degree of long-term desensitization
because the morphine-activated receptor was unable to internalize and hence recycle and resensitize effectively (koch
et al., 2005).
in the present study, we examined the coupling and desensitization of mor-activated girk currents in hek293 cells
stably expressing the mor1 subtype of mor at relatively
low, near physiological levels and transiently transfected
with  xxxg1252xxx  and  xxxg1254xxx  girk channels. by recording the
agonist-activated girk current, we can obtain a real-time
measure of mor activation. the agonists used were
damgo, a full agonist at mors, and morphine, which in
most systems behaves as a partial agonist at this receptor.
we found that damgo and morphine activated girk currents in these cells and that both agonists produced rapid
and quantitatively similar degrees of desensitization of girk
currents. however, the mechanism underlying the desensitization was agonist-specific, with damgo-induced desensitization being  xxxg970xxx -dependent, and morphine-induced desensitization being partly pkc-dependent. furthermore,
although the degree of desensitization by damgo and morphine was similar, damgo induced arrestin-2 translocation
to the plasma membrane, whereas morphine did not, and
damgo induced a far greater degree of mor1 internalization.

mor1 band was determined using a phosphorimager (ge healthcare, little chalfont, buckinghamshire, uk).
confirmation of grk6 dominant-negative mutant overexpression. the expression of grk6-k215r in hek293-mor1 cells
was verified using sds-page and western blotting as described
previously (ghadessy et al., 2003). in brief, resolved proteins were
transferred to hybond-ecl nitrocellulose membranes and incubated
first with a grk6 rabbit-polyclonal antibody (1:100) that recognizes
an epitope of residues 98 to 136 of human grk6 (ghadessy et al.,
2003). membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000) to enable protein detection by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
mor1 internalization. loss of surface mor1 as a result of
internalization was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a colorimetric alkaline phosphatase assay, as described
previously (bailey et al., 2003). in brief, hek293-mor1 cells were
first incubated with the primary antibody (anti-t7 monoclonal;
1:5000; novagen) for 60 min at 37°c to label surface mors. cells
were then washed and incubated with opioid agonists in dmem for
30 min at 37°c. cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and incubated
with secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse conjugated with alkaline
phosphatase; 1:1000), a colorimetric alkaline phosphatase substrate
(bio-rad laboratories ltd., hemel hempstead, hertfordshire, uk)
was then added and samples were assayed at 405 nm with a microplate reader. background was subtracted by simultaneous assay of
hek293 cells not expressing mor1. percentage surface receptor
loss was calculated by normalizing data from each treatment group
to corresponding control surface receptor levels determined from
cells not exposed to opioid agonists. all experiments were performed
in triplicate.
arrestin translocation. arrestin-2-gfp and arrestin-3-gfp redistribution was assessed as described previously (mundell et al.,
2000). briefly hek293-mor1 cells grown on poly-l-lysine coverslips
were transiently transfected with 0.5 ␮g of pegfp-n1-arrestin-2- or
3-gfp and incubated for 16 to 24 h before use. cells were then
washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline before imaging,
and coverslips were mounted in a heated imaging chamber through
which media and drugs could be added. cells were examined by
microscopy on an inverted leica tcs-nt confocal laser scanning

(n ⫽ 6), whereas the maximum current evoked by a receptor
saturating concentration of morphine (30 ␮m) was smaller
and had an amplitude of 299 ⫾ 37 pa (n ⫽ 6; p ⬍ 0.05),
indicating that morphine is a partial agonist at mor1 receptors (bailey et al., 2003, 2004). naloxone (1 ␮m) abolished the
current evoked by morphine (30 ␮m) and damgo (10 ␮m)
(n ⫽ 3 for each) (fig. 1, c and d). furthermore, pertussis
toxin pretreatment (0.1 ␮g/ml for 16 h) abolished the ability
of damgo and morphine to evoke any current (n ⫽ 4) (data
not shown).
mor1 desensitization. when damgo (10 ␮m) or morphine (30 ␮m) was applied for 10 min, they evoked an inward
current that reached a peak and then declined in the continued presence of the agonist (fig. 2, a and b). the desensitization to damgo (10 ␮m) and morphine (30 ␮m) was 73 ⫾

6 and 83 ⫾ 3%, respectively (n ⫽ 4 for each) (fig. 2, a–d). the
decay of the response to either damgo or morphine was well
fitted by a single exponential. although there was no significant difference between the amount of desensitization in
response to damgo or morphine (p ⬎ 0.05), the response to
damgo decayed slightly faster (t1/2, damgo ⫽ 79 s, 95%
confidence limits 72–87 s; t1/2, morphine ⫽ 109 s, 95% confidence limits 99–121 s). to demonstrate further that the
desensitization was not due to k⫹ buildup inside the cells
(see materials and methods), we measured the inward current only at the beginning and end of the 10 min of opioid
agonist application (fig. 2, e and f). under these conditions,
the opioid-evoked currents still desensitized by similar
amounts (damgo desensitization 80 ⫾ 11%; morphine desensitization 82 ⫾ 5%; n ⫽ 4 for each).

the morphine curve is 0.95, and the r2 value for damgo is 0.92. e and f, in these experiments, membrane potential was held at ⫺25 mv, and 60-ms
pulses to ⫺60 mv (to measure the amplitude of the opioid-evoked current) were only applied at the beginning (15–35 s) and end (585– 600 s) of the
10 min of opioid agonist application (n ⫽ 3). the responses to damgo and morphine desensitized by the same extent as in experiments in which pulses
to ⫺60 mv were applied repeatedly throughout the period of agonist application, confirming that desensitization was not the result of a build up of
k⫹ inside the cell. g and h, damgo and morphine desensitization was measured using whole-cell recording and perforated patch recording. data
from individual cells were normalized to the peak response and pooled. desensitization kinetics were then fitted to a single exponential decay. the
rate and extent of desensitization induced by damgo and morphine were the same under each recording condition (n ⫽ 3 for all).

to morphine was unaffected (fig. 3, a and b). overexpressing
grk6-k215r did not inhibit the desensitization induced by
either damgo or morphine (fig. 3, c and d). western blotting confirmed that the grk6-k125r mutant was being
overexpressed in hek293-mor1 cells (data not shown).
involvement of pkc in morphine-induced mor1 desensitization. to investigate whether pkc is involved in
the desensitization of morphine-induced girk currents as
proposed by bailey et al. (2004), we used the pkc pseudosubstrate inhibitory peptide [pkc (19-31)]. the peptide was
included in the recording pipette solution and allowed to
dialyze into the cell for 10 min before applying the opioid
agonists. pkc (19-31) (5 ␮m) significantly reduced the
amount of morphine-induced desensitization by ⬃50%, but it
had no effect on the desensitization induced by damgo (fig.
4, a and b). in addition, pkc (19-31) had no effect on the low
level of desensitization (⬃20%) induced by a concentration of
the full agonist damgo (100 nm) that evoked a similar-sized
girk current to a receptor-saturating concentration of the
partial agonist morphine (30 ␮m) (data not shown).
it is possible that pkc (19-31) did not completely block
morphine-induced desensitization because its activity had
been reduced by degradation of the peptide by intracellular
peptidases. we therefore examined the effect of membranepermeable pkc inhibitors. unfortunately, the pkc inhibitors  xxxd2195xxx  (1 ␮m) and chelerythrine (1 ␮m) abolished
the opioid-activated girk current and thus prevented their
use. the broad-spectrum protein kinase inhibitor  xxxd3241xxx  (1 ␮m) reduced the opioid-current by 67 ⫾ 12% (n ⫽ 3).
such inhibition of girk channels by  xxxd3241xxx  has been
reported previously, although the mechanism of the effect
remains unclear (lo and breitwieser, 1994). however, when
 xxxd3241xxx  was applied for 10 min before and then during
the application of damgo (10 ␮m) or morphine (30 ␮m), it
did not affect the desensitization induced by damgo but it
inhibited the desensitization induced by morphine by ⬃60%

the  xxxg1252xxx /3.2 channels 16 to 24 h before recordings were made. patchclamp recordings of opioid current decay from individual cells were
normalized to the peak response and
pooled. desensitization kinetics for
both damgo and morphine were
then fitted to single-exponential decays. a,  xxxg970xxx -k220r significantly
reduced the extent of damgo-induced desensitization (p ⬍ 0.05; n ⫽

(96 –132 s) under control conditions
and 69 s (44 –158 s) in cells expressing
 xxxg970xxx -k220r. b,  xxxg970xxx -k220r had
no effect on the extent or rate of morphine-induced desensitization (p ⬎

of damgo-induced desensitization
(p ⬎ 0.05; n ⫽ 4). d, grk6-k215r
expression had no effect on extent or
rate of morphine-induced desensitization (p ⬎ 0.05; n ⫽ 4).

to ensure that the desensitization we observed was not the
result of a loss of intracellular constituents after intracellular
dialysis of the cell in the whole-cell patch-clamp recording
mode, we performed perforated patch recordings using  xxxd164xxx  (225 ␮g/ml) in the pipette to perforate the region
of the cell membrane under the tip, permitting electrical
access to the interior of the cell, without dialysis of the
interior of the cell. in perforated patch mode, the desensitization by damgo (10 ␮m) and morphine (30 ␮m) was unchanged (fig. 2, g and h).
morphine-induced mor1 desensitization could also be observed at the level of g protein activation using a [35s]gtp␥s
binding assay. both damgo and morphine stimulated
[35s]gtp␥s binding to membranes of hek293-mor1 cells,
with ec50 values of 45 and 83 nm, respectively, whereas the
maximum response to morphine was similar to that of
damgo (response to 3 ␮m morphine was 95 ⫾ 2% of response to 1 ␮m damgo; n ⫽ 4). thus, the relative efficacy of
morphine seems to change when different readouts of agonist
action are used. pretreatment of intact cells for 30 min
with 1 ␮m damgo or 3 ␮m morphine led to significant

involvement of grks in damgo-induced mor1 desensitization. to investigate the role of g protein receptor
kinases in mor1 desensitization, the effect of overexpressing
dominant negative mutants of  xxxg970xxx  ( xxxg970xxx -k220r) and
grk6 (grk6-k215r) (ghadessy et al., 2003), which lack
kinase activity, was investigated. in cells overexpressing
 xxxg970xxx -k220r, the level of desensitization to damgo (10
␮m) was significantly reduced, whereas the desensitization

mechanism of mor desensitization is agonist-dependent

epitope-tagged mor1 were labeled with [32p]orthophosphate. mor1 was then immunoprecipitated in the presence
of phosphatase inhibitors, and the extent of 32p incorporation
was measured by phosphorimager analysis after sdspage. under control (basal) conditions, phosphorylated
mor1 could be visualized as a diffuse band at around 80 kda
(fig. 5, a and b). when cells were exposed to damgo (10
␮m) for up to 30 min, mor1 phosphorylation was markedly
increased, whereas in cells exposed to morphine (30 ␮m) for
up to 30 min, phosphorylation was enhanced but to a lesser
but consistent extent (fig. 5, a and b). these results are in
agreement with those of schulz et al. (2004). both basal
phosphorylation of mor1 and that in the presence of morphine were reduced by pre-exposing the cells to the broadspectrum pkc inhibitor  xxxd2195xxx  (1 ␮m) for 15 min. however, in the presence of  xxxd2195xxx , morphine was still able
to induce further mor1 phosphorylation. damgo-induced
mor1 phosphorylation was not reduced by  xxxd2195xxx .
agonist-induced arrestin translocation. in cells transiently transfected with arrestin-2-gfp, exposure to
damgo (10 ␮m) for 3 min produced a marked translocation
of arrestin-2 to the plasma membrane (fig. 6, a and b). in
contrast, exposure to morphine (30 ␮m) for 3 min failed to
produce any obvious movement of arrestin-2 from the cytoplasm (fig. 6, c and d). similar results were obtained with
arrestin-3-gfp (data not shown).

added to the solution in the recording

normalized to each peak response and
pooled.  xxxd3241xxx  or gö6976 was
applied to hek293-mor1 cells transiently expressing the  xxxg1252xxx /3.2 channel, for 10 min before and during the
10-min application of damgo or morphine. desensitization kinetics for both
damgo and morphine were then fitted to single-exponential decays. a,

pkc (19-31) significantly reduced the

vate pkc did not alter either the rate or the extent of the
desensitization induced by damgo (10 ␮m) or morphine (30
␮m) (n ⫽ 3 for each; data not shown).
to determine which isoforms of pkc are involved in mor1
desensitization by morphine, the effect of the pkc inhibitor
gö6976 was investigated. gö6976 was chosen because it only
inhibits the conventional isoforms of pkc (pkc␣, pkc␤, and
pkc␥) (martiny-baron et al., 1993) and pkc␮ (gschwendt et
al., 1996). as with  xxxd3241xxx , gö6976 inhibited the opioid-activated girk current by 49 ⫾ 6% (n ⫽ 6). gö6976 (1
␮m) applied for 10 min before and during the application of
damgo (10 ␮m) or morphine (30 ␮m) had no effect on the
rate or extent of the damgo-induced desensitization but
slowed only slightly the rate of morphine-induced desensitization without producing a marked decrease in the amount of
desensitization (fig. 4, e and f).
to determine whether the pkc component of morphineinduced mor1 desensitization resulted from ongoing plc
activity, either basal activity or enhanced activity as a result
of activation of a gq-coupled receptor, we examined the effect
of the plc inhibitor u-73122 (1 ␮m) included in the recording pipette solution on morphine-induced desensitization.
when u-73122 was allowed to diffuse from the pipette into
the cell for up to 20 min before applying morphine, it did not
inhibit either the rate or the extent of morphine-induced
mor1 desensitization (n ⫽ 4; data not shown).

discussion
the key finding of this work is that the mechanisms underlying the desensitization and internalization of mor1 are
agonist-dependent. although damgo and morphine application induced similar levels of desensitization of mor-mediated girk currents in hek293 cells, they did so by different molecular mechanisms. hence, whereas the full agonist
damgo induced desensitization by a  xxxg970xxx -dependent
mechanism, morphine induced desensitization by a grk2independent mechanism involving pkc. in addition,
damgo caused marked arrestin translocation and mor
internalization, whereas morphine did not cause measurable
arrestin translocation and induced much less mor internalization.
the agonist-induced homologous desensitization of many
gpcrs is thought to be mediated by phosphorylation of the
receptor, in numerous cases by the family of g protein-coupled receptor kinases. hek293 cells express  xxxg970xxx  endogenously (iwata et al., 2005), and damgo-induced desensitization of mor1-stimulated girk currents was markedly
reduced by a dominant negative mutant of  xxxg970xxx , grk2k220r (kong et al., 1994). the ability of  xxxg970xxx -k220r to
inhibit damgo-induced mor1 desensitization agrees with
previous studies implicating the closely related grks,
 xxxg970xxx ,  xxxg971xxx , or both, in mediating the phosphorylation,

hek293-mor1 cells grown on poly-l-lysine coverslips were transiently
transfected with 0.5 ␮g of pegfp-n1-arrestin-2-gfp. before stimulation
and viewing, coverslips were mounted in an imaging chamber at 37°c,
and arrestin-2-gfp distribution was monitored in real time. a and c,
arrestin-2-gfp has a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution in unstimulated
cells before agonist exposure. b, in cells exposed to morphine (30 ␮m) for
3 min, the diffuse cytoplasmic distribution of arrestin-2-gfp is maintained. d, in cells exposed to damgo (10 ␮m) for 3 min, significant
agonist-induced translocation of arrestin-2-gfp to the cell membrane is
visible. data shown are representative of three independent experiments.

in cells was determined by comparing the density of surface
mors on control cells incubated in medium for 30 min to the
receptor density of cells that were fixed in formaldehyde
immediately after antibody labeling (i.e., not incubated for 30
min). over 30 min, constitutive internalization accounted for
8 ⫾ 2% of receptor loss.
damgo produced a concentration-dependent enhancement of mor1 internalization (fig. 7a). the ec50 value for
the damgo-evoked internalization was 470 nm (150 nm–
1.47 ␮m; 95% confidence limits). the internalization produced by morphine was significantly less (fig. 7, b, d, and
e); it seemed to be concentration-dependent, but we have
been unable to fit a sigmoidal curve to the data. to determine
the time course for mor1 internalization, cells were incubated with receptor saturating concentrations of damgo or
morphine for periods up to 60 min (fig. 7, c and d). internalization could be detected after 10-min exposure to
damgo (10 ␮m) or morphine (30 ␮m) and had reached a
maximum by 30 min of agonist exposure. a receptor saturating concentration of damgo (10 ␮m) produced 52 ⫾ 3%
mor1 internalization over 30 min, whereas a receptor-saturating concentration of morphine (30 ␮m) produced only
15 ⫾ 3% internalization (n ⫽ 7 for both; fig. 7e).

mechanism of mor desensitization is agonist-dependent

desensitization of the receptor, and thus did not trigger measurable arrestin association with the receptor. these findings, however, should be tempered by those recently made by
bohn et al. (2004) who suggested that in hek293 cells,
recruitment of endogenous arrestins to morphine-activated
mors could potentially prevent the assessment of arrestingfp translocation. they also observed that in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, cells transfected with the mor and either
arrestin-2-gfp or arrestin-3-gfp but lacking both endogenous arrestins morphine induced detectable translocation of
arrestin-3-gfp but not arrestin-2-gfp.
in contrast to damgo, morphine-induced desensitization
of mor1 responses was partially inhibited by the pkc inhibitory peptide pkc (19-31), which acts as a pseudosubstrate for pkc as well as by the broad-spectrum kinase
inhibitor  xxxd3241xxx . it is noteworthy that both  xxxd3241xxx  and the pkc inhibitory peptide inhibited morphine-

internalization was subtracted from that of the agonistinduced internalization in each experiment.

desensitization, and internalization of mors by full agonists
(zhang et al., 1998; wang, 2000; celver et al., 2001, 2004; li
and wang, 2001; schulz et al., 2002). hek293 cells also
express grk6 endogenously (iwata et al., 2005), but a dominant negative mutant of grk6 was unable to modify
damgo-induced mor1 desensitization, indicating the specificity of action of  xxxg970xxx -k220r. in contrast to the desensitization induced by damgo, neither  xxxg970xxx -k220r nor
grk6-k215r inhibited the morphine-induced desensitization of mor1, indicating that grks are probably not responsible for the morphine-induced desensitization of mor1 responses.
we and others (whistler and von zastrow, 1998) have
observed that morphine-activated mors were unable to recruit nonvisual arrestins to the receptor. this can be explained by our present findings, where the morphine-activated mor1 did not induce significant grk-dependent

neurons, there are striking similarities. in hek293 cells,
damgo and morphine induced rapid desensitization of
girk currents (present study), whereas in the locus ceruleus, which expresses predominantly mor1, damgo and
other high-efficacy mor1 agonists were able to induce rapid
desensitization of girk currents, whereas morphine induced
less desensitization (bailey et al., 2003; dang and williams,
2005). in the locus ceruleus, basal pkc activity did not seem
to be sufficient to induce mor desensitization. to reveal
pkc-mediated desensitization required activation of pkc
through gq-coupled muscarinic receptors or with the phorbol
ester phorbol-12- xxxd2681xxx -13-acetate. this suggests that
hek293 cells have a higher basal level of pkc activity than
locus ceruleus neurons. in addition, in locus ceruleus neurons the pkc-mediated component of mor desensitization
was mediated entirely by conventional pkc isoforms because
it was completely inhibited by gö6976 (c. p. bailey, unpublished observations). morphine has also been shown to induce profound desensitization of mors responsiveness in
att20 cells (borgland et al., 2003; celver et al., 2004), but
unfortunately, the involvement of pkc in this desensitization was not investigated.
it is noteworthy that the present results suggest that the
different mechanisms of damgo- and morphine-induced
mor1 desensitization in hek293 cells cannot be explained
simply by the lower efficacy of morphine at mor1, but it is
likely instead to result from different conformations of mor1
being stabilized by the two agonists, which consequently
recruit different regulatory elements to the receptor. there is
some evidence to support this. damgo, but not morphine,
activation of mor1 increased the activity of phospholipase
d2 (koch et al., 2003), which seems to be important for
damgo-induced mor1 internalization (koch et al., 2004).
there is increasing evidence that ligand-selective gpcr conformations are functionally relevant for a number of gpcrs
(for review, see kenakin, 2003; perez and karnik, 2005),
whereas a recent study showed that differential phosphorylation of the cooh terminus of ␤2-adrenoceptors was induced by receptor agonists (trester-zedlitz et al., 2005),
which could lead to activation of different regulatory pathways.
our results indicate that agonist-dependent mechanisms
of desensitization and internalization occur for mor1 receptors. because morphine-desensitized receptors are not internalized, they will be retained on the plasma membrane in the
desensitized form in the continued presence of morphine,
whereas high-efficacy mor agonists induce a grk-dependent mor desensitization and in the presence of these agonists, the desensitized mors can be rapidly internalized,
dephosphorylated, resensitized, and recycled back to the
plasma membrane. the lack of recycling of morphine-desensitized receptors may explain why morphine induces a
greater degree of tolerance than high-efficacy opioid agonists
(koch et al., 2005).

induced desensitization to the same degree but did not fully
block it, suggesting either that at the concentrations used,
these agents did not fully inhibit pkc activity, or that a
pkc-independent process also contributes to the morphineinduced desensitization. it was crucial that inhibition of pkc
did not affect damgo-induced desensitization of mor1 responsiveness.
furthermore, gö6976, a pkc inhibitor with preference for
conventional pkc isoforms (way et al., 2000), produced
much less inhibition of morphine-induced desensitization
than the pkc inhibitory peptide and  xxxd3241xxx . this
suggests that a combination of conventional and other pkc
isoforms are involved in mor1 desensitization in hek293
cells. of course, hek293 cells endogenously express some
conventional (␣, ␤i, and ␤ii but not ␥), novel (␦ and ␧), and
atypical pkc isoforms (␰) (leaney et al., 2001; wagey et al.,
2001).
we have observed that in hek293 cells, the mor is phosphorylated by pkc even in the absence of morphine. this is
in line with previous work that has shown activation of pkc
with a  xxxd2925xxx  to induce direct phosphorylation of
mors in the absence of an opioid agonist (zhang et al., 1996;
el khouhen et al., 1999) and may indicate a high level of
basal pkc activity in hek293 cells. this high basal level of
pkc activity cannot be due to ongoing activation of plc
because a plc inhibitor did not inhibit morphine-induced
desensitization. because in hek293 cells the mor is already
phosphorylated by pkc, morphine does not need to activate
pkc and does not induce pkc phosphorylation of the mor;
rather, when morphine binds to mors already phosphorylated by pkc, the receptor rapidly desensitizes either by
subsequently adopting a desensitized conformation or by facilitating the binding of some secondary accessory protein
that induces desensitization. morphine has previously been
reported to cause translocation of pkc to the plasma membrane in sh-sy5y cells but only after 2 h of agonist exposure
(kramer and simon, 1999). such translocation is unlikely to
contribute to the desensitization observed in hek293 cells
because desensitization occurs during the first 1 to 2 min of
exposure to morphine.
in the presence of a pkc inhibitor, we observed a small
amount of morphine-induced phosphorylation of mor1.
other workers have previously reported that morphine is
able to induce mor1 phosphorylation (zhang et al., 1996; yu
et al., 1997; schulz et al., 2004). this and the large amount of
damgo-induced phosphorylation of mor1 are likely to be
mediated by  xxxg970xxx  (zhang et al., 1998) and may be responsible for the small amount of mor1 internalization observed
with morphine.
although we observed that morphine induced rapid (t1/2 ⬍
2 min) desensitization in hek293 cells, others have reported
a slower rate of morphine-induced desensitization occurring
(over 1 h) (koch et al., 2004; schulz et al., 2004) or no
desensitization by morphine (whistler and von zastrow,
1998). although we cannot offer a definitive explanation for
these different results, one important difference between the
studies is the level of mor expression. we have used cells
expressing mors at a level close to those reported to occur
physiologically.
although the pattern of desensitization of mor1 responses
in hek293 cells may seem to be different from that for
endogenous mors in mature rat brainstem locus ceruleus
