summary
phospholipase d (pld), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of
phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidic acid and choline,
plays key roles in cellular signal transduction by mediating
extracellular stimuli including hormones, growth factors,
neurotransmitters, cytokines and extracellular matrix
molecules. the molecular mechanisms by which domains
regulate the activity of pld – especially the phox
homology (px) domain – have not been fully elucidated.
in this study, we have examined the properties of the px
domains of  xxxg1772xxx  and  xxxg1773xxx  in terms of phosphoinositide
binding and pld activity regulation. interestingly, the px
domain of  xxxg1772xxx , but not that of  xxxg1773xxx , was found to
specifically interact with phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)trisphosphate (ptdins(3,4,5)p3). we found that mutation of
the conserved arginine at position 179 of the  xxxg1772xxx  px
domain to lysine or to alanine (r179a or r179k,
respectively) disrupts ptdins(3,4,5)p3 binding. in nih-3t3
cells, the egfp- xxxg1772xxx  px wild-type domain, but not the
two mutants, localized to the plasma membrane after 5minute treatment with platelet-derived growth factor

(pdgf). the enzymatic activity of  xxxg1772xxx  was stimulated
by adding ptdins(3,4,5)p3 in vitro. treatment with pdgf
resulted in the significant increase of  xxxg1772xxx  activity and
phosphorylation of the downstream extracellular signalregulated kinases (erks), which was blocked by pretreatment of hek 293 cells with phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(pi3k) inhibitor after the endogenous  xxxg1773xxx  had been
depleted by sirna specific for  xxxg1773xxx . nevertheless, both
 xxxg1772xxx 
mutants
(which
cannot
interact
with
ptdins(3,4,5)p3) did not respond to treatment with pdgf.
moreover,  xxxg1772xxx  was activated in hepg2 cells stably
expressing the y40/51 mutant of pdgf receptor that is
required for the binding with pi3k. our results suggest
that the  xxxg1772xxx  px domain enables  xxxg1772xxx  to mediate signal
transduction via  xxxg1369xxx /2 by providing a direct binding site
for ptdins(3,4,5)p3 and by activating  xxxg1772xxx .

introduction
phospholipase d (pld) mediates various cellular signaling
events, including cytoskeletal rearrangement, vesicle
trafficking, and proliferation by modulating membrane
compositions and/or by producing phosphatidic acid (cross et
al., 1996; frohman et al., 1999; jones et al., 1999; rizzo et al.,
1999). phosphatidic acid, the product of pld action, is a well
known second messenger and is implicated in various
regulatory roles in signaling molecules (frohman and morris,
1999). the activity regulation of pld is achieved by
phosphorylation (kim et al., 1999; lee et al., 1997) and
binding with small molecular weight guanine nucleotide
binding proteins (smgs) such as adp-ribosylation factor
(arf), rho, rac and cdc42 (hammond et al., 1997; yamazaki
et al., 1999). however, little is known about the details of the
molecular mechanism and the roles of domains in the
regulation of pld.
phosphoinositide (pi) functions in diverse cellular processes

(martin, 1998; odorizzi et al., 2000). the  xxxd2360xxx  headgroup of ptdins contains five hydroxyl groups (at positions 2,
3, 4, 5 and 6), three of which (3, 4, and 5) are known to be
reversible phosphorylation targets to yield singly, doubly
or triply phosphorylated phosphatidylinositide (ptdins)
derivatives (ptdins3p, ptdins4p, ptdins5p, ptdins(3,4)p2,
ptdins(3,5)p2, ptdins(4,5)p2, and ptdins(3,4,5)p3) of different
combinations. the activities of specific ptdins are regulated by
controlling their cellular levels, which is achieved by complex
networks of proteins that regulate their synthesis (kinases) and
degradation (phosphatases and lipases) (de camilli et al.,
1996; fruman et al., 1998; rameh and cantley, 1999;
vanhaesebroeck et al., 2001). of these, ptdins(3,4,5)p3 is
synthesized when the mammalian class i phosphatidylinositide
3-kinase (pi3k) is recruited to the plasma membrane after the
activation of a cell-surface-receptor kinase. the binding of
ptdins(3,4,5)p3 to its effector phosphoinositide-dependent
kinase-1 (pdk-1) (stokoe et al., 1997) mediates the

key words: px domain, pld, phosphoinositides, erk

translocation of pdk-1 to a place where it can phosphorylate
and activate akt (protein kinase b, pkb) (stephens et al.,
1998), which results in the increased phosphorylation of
several substrates including glycogen synthase kinase-3 (gsk3), p70s6k and  xxxg693xxx  (scott et al., 1998). these, in turn,
activate diverse metabolic pathways and are necessary for
cell survival (stephens et al., 1998). however, ptdinsspecific cellular functions, especially ptdins(3,4,5)p3-induced
molecular activation and signaling events, are not fully
understood.
the phox homology (px) domain is named after its presence
in the p40phox and  xxxg1508xxx  subunits of the nadph oxidase
complex and has an approximately ~140 amino-acid-long
motif (ponting, 1996). px domains are found in a range of
proteins associated with membranes such as pld, sorting
nexins and yeast vam7p, and contain a proline-rich motif,
which enables them to recognize the src homology 3 (sh3)
domain (jang et al., 2003; kay et al., 2000; ponting, 1996).
moreover, recent studies have shown that, specific interactions
between px domains and phosphoinositides play a crucial role
in the localization and enzymatic regulation of px-domaincontaining proteins, and have identified the px domain as a
phosphoinositide-binding module involved in cellular signal
transduction (ago et al., 2001; cheever et al., 2001; ellson et
al., 2001; kanai et al., 2001; xu et al., 2001; zhan et al., 2002).
 xxxg1772xxx  and  xxxg1773xxx  isozymes share several structural domains
including the n-terminally localized px domain (frohman et
al., 1999; ponting, 1996). recently, du et al. suggested that the
px domain of  xxxg1772xxx  plays a role in the re-entry of  xxxg1772xxx  into
perinuclear vesicles after its pma-stimulated translocation
to the plasma membrane (du et al., 2003). however, the
molecular characteristics of the px domain of pld, especially
its role in the regulation of enzymatic activity, remains unclear.
to check the phosphoinositide-binding ability of the pld px
domain and to characterize the functional role of this
interaction, we investigated the lipid affinity of pld. here, we
show that the  xxxg1772xxx  px domain specifically binds to
ptdins(3,4,5)p3, which is critical in  xxxg1772xxx  activity regulation.
materials and methods
chemicals and reagents
phosphoinositides were purchased from echelon biosciences inc.
(salt lake city, ut). the enhanced chemiluminescence kit
(ecl system), dipalmitoyl-phosphatidyl [methyl-3h]choline, and
glutathione sepharose 4b were from amersham pharmacia
biotech (buckinghamshire, uk). dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine
(dipalmitoyl-pc), dioleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (dioleoyl-pe)
was purchased from sigma (st louis, mo). water soluble
inositolphosphates were a generous gift from sung ki chung (pohang
university of science and technology, korea). silica gel 60 tlc
plates and triton x-100 were acquired from em science (gibbstown,
nj). dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem) and
lipofectamine were purchased from invitrogen (carlsbad, ca).
bovine calf serum was obtained from hyclone (logan, ut).
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit igg, anti-mouse
igg, igm, and iga were purchased from kirkegaard and perry
laboratories inc. (gaithersburg, md).  xxxd2523xxx  and porcine
platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf) were purchased from
calbiochem (san diego, ca). antibody against phosphorylated
extracellular signal-regulated kinases (erks) was from cell signaling
(beverly, ma). antibody against the c-terminal region of pld was
prepared as previously described (lee et al., 1997).

cell culture
nih-3t3, hek 293 and hepg2 cells stably expressing mutant
pdgf␤ receptor y40/51 (bae et al., 2000; valius and kazlauskas,
1993) were cultured at 37°c in a humidified 5% co2 atmosphere in
high glucose dmem supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.
generation of plasmids and recombinant proteins
mutants  xxxg1772xxx (r179k) or  xxxg1772xxx (r179a) were generated by point
mutating the arginine residue in wild-type  xxxg1772xxx  at position 179 to
lysine or alanine, respectively, by using the splice-overlap extension
method (ho et al., 1989). briefly,  xxxg1772xxx (r179k) was obtained by
using forward primer: 5⬘-g ttc ttt ggc aag agg caa c-3⬘
and reverse primer: 5⬘-g ttg cct ctt gcc aaa gaa c-3⬘. a
similar strategy was used to generate  xxxg1772xxx (r179a), this time by
using forward primer: 5⬘-g ttc ttt ggc  xxxg873xxx  agg caa c-3⬘
and reverse primer: 5⬘-g ttg cct cgc gcc aaa gaa c-3⬘. the
resulting products were cloned into the pcdna3.1 vector
(invitrogen). sequences of the  xxxg1772xxx  px domain (amino acids 76196) of wild type, and mutants (r179k and r179a) were amplified
by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and subcloned into vector
pgex4t1 (amersham pharmacia biotech) or pegfp (enhanced
green fluorescent protein)-c1 (pegfp-c1, clontech) vector to
generate glutathione-s-transferase (gst)- xxxg1772xxx  px or egfp- xxxg1772xxx 
px constructs, respectively. to purify the recombinant proteins,
escherichia coli bl21 cells were transformed with individual
expression vectors encoding gst fusion protein and grown at 37°c
to an od600 of 0.8. fusion proteins were then induced by incubating
the cells in the presence of 100 ␮m isopropyl-␤-dthiogalactopyranoside for 4 hours at 25°c. after harvesting the cells,
the fusion proteins were purified with glutathione-sepharose 4b
(amersham pharmacia biotech).
liposome-binding assay
phospholipid-vesicles composed of 53 ␮m phosphatidylethanolamine
(pe), 3.3 ␮m phosphatidylcholine, and 4.6 ␮m phosphoinositides
(ptdins) were incubated with 10 ng of the purified gst-pld px
domains in 150 ␮l buffer a (50 mm hepes-naoh ph 7.5, 3 mm
mgcl2, 2 mm cacl2, 3 mm egta, and 80 mm kcl) as previously
described (kim et al., 1998). after incubation at 37°c for 15 minutes,
the reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 300,000 g for 30 minutes in
a tl-100 ultracentrifuge (beckman). supernatants and pellets were
then subjected to sds-page and immunoblotted using anti-gst
antibody. in competition analysis, water soluble inositolphosphates
were added to incubation mixtures.
in vitro pld activity assays
pld activity was determined by measuring choline release from
phosphatidylcholine as previously described (kim et al., 1999) with
a minor modification. the enzyme sources in this study were obtained
from hek 293 cells. cells transfected with  xxxg1772xxx ,  xxxg1772xxx (r179k),
and  xxxg1772xxx (r179a) were harvested with buffer a. after sonication, 1
␮g of lysate was used per assay.
in vivo pld activity assays
pld activity analysis was performed as previously described (kim et
al., 1999). briefly, full-length  xxxg1772xxx  wild-type,  xxxg1772xxx (r179k) or
 xxxg1773xxx  genes were transiently expressed. transfection was carried out
with lipofectamine, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
in hek 293 cells, depletion of endogenous  xxxg1773xxx  was performed
using small interference rna (sirna) for  xxxg1773xxx , as described
previously (kim et al., 2005). after starving the cells for 24 hours,
they were incubated with 10 ␮ci [3h] xxxd2681xxx  for 3 hours. pld
activity was determined using the transphosphatidylation reaction in

ptdins(3,4,5)p3- xxxg1772xxx  px interaction
the presence of 0.4% 1-butanol. lipids were extracted and separated
by silica gel 60 thin-layer chromatography (volume ratio of
chloroform: methanol: acetic acid, 90:10:10), and the amounts of
labeled phosphatidylbutanol and total lipid were determined using a
fuji bas-2000 image analyzer (fuji film).
immunocytochemistry and confocal imaging
nih-3t3 cells grown on cover slips were transfected with pegfppld1 px wild type, pegfp- xxxg1772xxx  px (r179k) or pegfp- xxxg1772xxx  px
(r179a). after 24 hours of serum starvation, cells were treated with
pdgf (25 ng/ml) and fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 30
minutes. the slides were mounted and signals were visualized by
confocal laser scanning microscopy (zeiss lsm510, germany).
fractionation of cells
nih-3t3 cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline
(pbs) and scraped with buffer b (pbs containing 0.25 m sucrose and
a protease-inhibitor mixture). the cell suspension was then
homogenized using a dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 3000
g for 15 minutes, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at
100,000 g for 30 minutes. the resulting supernatants (cytosol
fraction) and pellets (membrane fraction) were subjected to sdspage and marked as cyt and mem, respectively.

results
the  xxxg1772xxx  px domain binds specifically to ptdins(3,4,5)p3
pld contains a n-terminal px domain, which can bind
phosphoinositide to modulate its localization and activity. fig.
1a shows the sequence alignment of part of the px domain of
several px-domain-containing proteins. the px domains of
pld have high homology with those of other proteins. to
determine whether the pld-px domain interacts with
phosphoinositides, purified gst- xxxg1772xxx  px and gst- xxxg1773xxx  px
domains were incubated with liposomes containing a range of
phosphoinositides. as shown in fig. 1b, the  xxxg1772xxx  px domain,
but not the  xxxg1773xxx  px domain, selectively bound to
ptdins(3,4,5)p3. the  xxxg1772xxx  has a conserved arg (r179),
crucial for phosphoinositide binding (ago et al., 2001; fruman
et al., 1999), whereas  xxxg1773xxx  has a lys residue at the
corresponding residue. therefore, we mutated r179 of  xxxg1772xxx 
to lys (r179k) or ala (r179a) and, as expected, both gstpld1 px(r179k) and gst- xxxg1772xxx  px(r179a) failed to
interact with ptdins(3,4,5)p3. we further characterized the
ptdins(3,4,5)p3 selectivity of  xxxg1772xxx  px by inositolphosphate
competition analysis. fig. 1c shows that the interaction
between  xxxg1772xxx  px and ptdins(3,4,5)p3-containing liposome

(phosphatidylethanolamine), pc (phosphatidylcholine) and indicated ptdins (phosphatidylinositol) were analyzed. liposomes (see materials
and methods) were incubated with 10 ng of purified gst-pld px for 15 minutes at 37°c. the reaction mixtures were then centrifuged and the
resulting supernatant (s) and pellets (p) were subjected to sds-page. western blotting was performed with anti-gst antibody. a
representative result of three individual experiments is shown. (c) the selectivity of ptdins(3,4,5)p3 for the  xxxg1772xxx  px domain was confirmed
by competition analysis. water-soluble inositolphosphates were added to the reaction mixture as described in (b). (d) the affinity of  xxxg1772xxx  px
for ptdins(3,4,5)p3 was compared with those of ph domains from btk and pdk-1.

was competed by the addition of ins(1,3,4,5)p4 in a dosedependent manner but that it was not affected by any other
inositolphosphate. next, we checked the affinity between the
 xxxg1772xxx  px domain and ptdins(3,4,5)p3 by comparing it with the
pleckstrin homology (ph) domain of pdk-1 and bruton’s
 xxxg2198xxx  (btk) that have a kd value for ptdins(3,4,5)p3
of 1.6 nm and 40 nm, respectively (currie et al., 1999). the
liposome-binding analysis with ptdins(3,4,5)p3-containing
vesicles showed that, for ptdins(3,4,5)p3, the  xxxg1772xxx  px domain
has a higher affinity than the btk ph domain but a lower
affinity than pdk-1 ph domain (fig. 1d). taken together,
these results suggest that the  xxxg1772xxx  px domain can mediate
ptdins(3,4,5)p3 interaction and that the conserved arg179 is
crucial for this interaction.
the  xxxg1772xxx  px domain interacts with ptdins(3,4,5)p3 in
nih-3t3 cells
pi3k is known to catalyze the phosphorylation of the d-3
position of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides and to prefer

ptdins(4,5)p2 as its substrate, resulting in a high level of
ptdins(3,4,5)p3 in cells (auger et al., 1989; vanhaesebroeck et
al., 2001). with the obtained knowledge that pld1px has a
high affinity for ptdins(3,4,5)p3 in vitro, we wanted to examine
whether this interaction occurs also in vivo. therefore, we
generated egfp- xxxg1772xxx  px constructs. pegfp- xxxg1772xxx  px wild
type, pegfp- xxxg1772xxx  px(r179k) or pegfp- xxxg1772xxx  px(r179a)
were expressed in nih-3t3 cells. after 24 hours of serum
starvation, we observed a diffused pattern of the wild type and
both mutants in the cytosol (fig. 2a). interestingly, after a 5minute treatment with pdgf, egfp- xxxg1772xxx  px as well as
bruton’s  xxxg2198xxx  (btk) ph domain, which specifically
recognizes ptdins(3,4,5)p3, were localized in plasma
membrane. the r179k and r179a mutants, however, which
have no affinity to ptdins(3,4,5)p3 in vitro, did not change their
intracellular localization in the presence of pdgf. moreover,
when cells were fractionated into cytosolic (cyt) and
membrane (mem) fractions, only the wild-type  xxxg1772xxx  px
domain showed membrane localization after pdgf treatment
(fig. 2b). to further determine whether the plasma membrane
localization of  xxxg1772xxx  px was mediated by interaction with
ptdins(3,4,5)p3, we examined the effect of  xxxd2523xxx , a pi3kspecific inhibitor. when cells were pre-treated with ly
294002, a pdgf-induced plasma membrane localization of
 xxxg1772xxx  px did not occur (fig. 3a). this was further confirmed
by the cell-fractionation studies (fig. 3b). taken together,
these data show that the  xxxg1772xxx  px domain can interact with
ptdins(3,4,5)p3 in vivo, resulting in its localization in the
plasma membrane in nih-3t3 cells.
ptdins(3,4,5)p3 activates  xxxg1772xxx  in vitro
we found that the  xxxg1772xxx  px domain serves as a

px(r179a), or pegfp-btk ph. (a) after 24 hours of serum
starvation, cells were treated with pdgf (25 ng/ml). after 5 minutes,
cells were fixed and the localization of  xxxg1772xxx  px domains was
visualized by confocal microscopy. bars, 10 ␮m. (b) cells as
described in (a) were cultured in dishes and fractionated into cytosolic
(cyt) and membrane (mem) fractions. western blotting was performed
with anti-egfp antibody and show that only the wild-type  xxxg1772xxx  px
domain showed membrane localization after pdgf treatment.

applied for 5 minutes, after the pre-incubation of cells with dmso
or 50 ␮m of the pi3k inhibitor  xxxd2523xxx , for 20 minutes at 37°c.

ptdins(3,4,5)p3- xxxg1772xxx  px interaction
ptdins(3,4,5)p3-binding module. thus we investigated whether
the interaction of ptdins(3,4,5)p3 with the  xxxg1772xxx  px domain
plays a regulatory role in the enzymatic activity of pld. in
vitro, pld activity was measured as described in materials and
methods, using phosphoinositide-containing lipid vesicles as a
substrate. homogenates of hek 293 cells transfected with
wild-type  xxxg1772xxx , r179k  xxxg1772xxx  or r179a  xxxg1772xxx  were used as
an enzyme source. as shown in fig. 4a, ptdins(4,5)p2, which
was previously reported to stimulate pld (kim et al., 1998;
sciorra et al., 1999), enhanced the activities of  xxxg1772xxx  wild type,
r179k and r179a. addition of arf and gtp␥s further
stimulated the ptdins(4,5)p2-induced activation of wild-type
 xxxg1772xxx  and the two mutants r179k and r179a  xxxg1772xxx  (data not
shown), indicating that both mutants can response to arf, a
well known activator of  xxxg1772xxx  (hammond et al., 1997).
interestingly, ptdins(3,4,5)p3 strongly stimulated wild-type

fig. 4. ptdins(3,4,5)p3 activates  xxxg1772xxx  in vitro. (a) the effects of a
range of phosphatidylinositols on the in-vitro activity of  xxxg1772xxx  were
analyzed as described in materials and methods. liposomes,
reconstituted with phosphatidylethanolamine (pe),
phosphatidylcholine (pc) and the indicated phosphatidylinositols,
were used as substrates. error bars indicate standard deviations. data
are representative of three independent experiments. immunoblot in
the inset indicates that the amount of  xxxg1772xxx  preparation used in this
study were similar. (b) the dose-dependency of stimulation was
checked using liposomes containing pe, pc, ptdins and
ptdins(3,4,5)p3. the sum of the concentrations of ptdins and
ptdins(3,4,5)p3 was maintained at 4.6 ␮m.

 xxxg1772xxx  activity when compared with  xxxg1772xxx (r179k) or
 xxxg1772xxx (r179a). moreover, as shown in fig. 4b,
ptdins(3,4,5)p3-induced  xxxg1772xxx  activation occurs in a dosedependent manner. these results indicate that ptdins(3,4,5)p3
interacts directly with the px domain of  xxxg1772xxx  and stimulates
its activity in vitro.
ptdins(3,4,5)p3-induced  xxxg1772xxx  activation promotes erk
phosphorylation
next, we checked whether the interaction of ptdins(3,4,5)p3
with  xxxg1772xxx  px is involved in  xxxg1772xxx  activity in cells. to prevent
background effects caused by  xxxg1773xxx , we depleted endogenous
 xxxg1773xxx  with sirna in hek 293 cells, and investigated  xxxg1772xxx 
activity by measuring the amount of phosphatidylbutanol that
had accumulated within 2 minutes after pdgf treatment. as
shown, activity of  xxxg1772xxx  dramatically rose in the presence of
pdgf, an effect that was prevented by the pre-treatment of ly

phosphorylation. (a) 5⫻105 hek 293 cells depleted of endogenous

after transfection, cells were starved for 24 hours followed by an
incubation with [3h] xxxd2681xxx  for 3 hours. phosphatidylbutanol
(pbt) accumulation was measured in the presence of 0.4% butanol
after 2 minutes. cells were incubated with  xxxd2523xxx  (50 ␮m) or
dmso for 20 minutes before pdgf treatment. error bars indicate
standard deviations. data are representative of three separate
experiments. to check expression levels of pld, the same amounts
of cell lysates (20 ␮g) were subjected to sds-page and then
immunoblotted with anti-c-terminal pld antibody (data not shown).
(b) activation of  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx  induced by the stimulation of
pld were compared. (upper panel) the phosphorylation status of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 was analyzed by western blotting with an antiphosphorylated-erk antibody. (lower panel) expression levels of
 xxxg1369xxx /2. the fold-increases of  xxxg1366xxx  phosphorylation were
calculated from the ratio of phosphorylated  xxxg1366xxx  to
unphosphorylated  xxxg1366xxx  (perk2: xxxg1366xxx ) determined by

294002 (fig. 5a). previous reports have suggested that
phosphatidic acid generated by pld, mediates  xxxg1924xxx 
translocation to the plasma membrane and the activation of the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) pathway (rizzo et
al., 1999; rizzo et al., 2000). thus, we checked whether
ptdins(3,4,5)p3-induced  xxxg1772xxx  activity results in mapk
activation. as shown in fig. 5b, high levels of phosphorylated
 xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx  were observed after pdgf treatment.
pre-treatment with the pi3k-specific inhibitor  xxxd2523xxx ,
however,
blocked
this
pdgf-induced
 xxxg1369xxx /2
phosphorylation, which correlates well with the activity
profiles of  xxxg1772xxx .  xxxg1366xxx  phosphorylation is expressed as fold
increase of phosphorylated  xxxg1366xxx  divided by total  xxxg1366xxx  as
determined by densitometry analysis (fig. 5b, upper
immunoblots). these results indicate that generation of
ptdins(3,4,5)p3 induces  xxxg1772xxx  stimulation and promotes erk
activation in hek 293 cells.
interaction with ptdins(3,4,5)p3 is crucial for the pdgfinduced  xxxg1772xxx  activation
we next addressed the association of ptdins(3,4,5)p3 with
 xxxg1772xxx  px in context of the enzymatic activity of  xxxg1772xxx . since
pdgf-induced pld activation has been assigned to smgs
(shome et al., 1998; voss et al., 1999) and phospholipase c␥1 (plc␥1) (lee et al., 1994; yeo et al., 1994), we used
hepg2 cells that stably expressed the mutant pdgf receptor
y40/51 pdgf␤r. this mutant receptor can recruit pi3k but
not the ras gtpase-activating protein (ras gap), the src
homology 2 (sh2)-domain-containing protein-tyrosine
phosphatase-2 ( xxxg1894xxx ) and plc␥ 1 (bae et al., 2000; valius
and kazlauskas, 1993). in contrast to  xxxg1772xxx (r179k) and
 xxxg1773xxx , stimulation with pdgf resulted in a threefold increase
of activity of endogenous and wild-type  xxxg1772xxx , as shown in
fig. 6. furthermore, inhibition of pi3k by pre-incubating the

fig. 6. interaction with ptdins(3,4,5)p3 is crucial for pdgf-induced
activation of  xxxg1772xxx . hepg2 cells stably expressing mutant y40/51
pdgf␤r were transiently transfected as indicated. pld activity was
measured for 2 minutes in the presence of pdgf (25 ng/ml). to
inhibit pi3k, cells were treated with 50 ␮m  xxxd2523xxx  for 20
minutes before treatment with pdgf. data are representative of three
separate experiments. error bars indicate standard deviations.
immunoblots in the inset show that the expression levels of pld
were similar.

cells with  xxxd2523xxx  prevented the activation of  xxxg1772xxx  by
pdgf. these results indicate that the pi3k pathway is involved
in pdgf-mediated  xxxg1772xxx  activation, and that the interaction
between ptdins(3,4,5)p3 and the  xxxg1772xxx  px domain plays a
crucial role in the activation of  xxxg1772xxx  in vivo.
discussion
it is becoming clear that specific interactions of
phosphoinositide with the px domain are crucial for the
cellular function of host proteins. in this study, we investigated
whether the pld px domain can bind to specific
phosphoinositides and the meaning of this interaction. our
findings show that ptdins(3,4,5)p3 has affinity for the  xxxg1772xxx 
px domain and enhances the enzymatic activity of  xxxg1772xxx .
the downstream molecular mechanisms that mediate the
suggested function of pi3k in growth-factor-induced signal
transduction such as cell survival, vesicle trafficking and
cytoskeletal rearrangement (downward, 1997; fruman et al.,
1998; martin, 1998; rameh and cantley, 1999; toker and
cantley, 1997) are not fully understood. to elucidate how
pi3k acts, several laboratories have tried to identify
ptdins(3,4,5)p3-binding proteins (fukui et al., 1998;
vanhaesebroeck et al., 2001). pdk-1 is a well known
ptdins(3,4,5)p3-binding protein that translocates to the plasma
membrane after binding to ptdins(3,4,5)p3 through its ph
domain, thus regulating the metabolism and cell-survivalrelated roles of pi3k by phosphorylating akt. in addition,
swap-70, a ptdins(3,4,5)p3-dependent guanine nucleotide
exchange factor (gef) for rac, can regulate membrane
ruffling induced by  xxxg681xxx  (egf) or pdgf
(shinohara et al., 2002). although it was reported that the
inhibition of pi3k activity results in the downregulation of
pld activity (emoto et al., 2000; kozawa et al., 1997;
standaert et al., 1996), the mechanism involved is unknown.
our finding that the  xxxg1772xxx  px domain has affinity for
ptdins(3,4,5)p3 is an important clue. it provides an
explanation for the previously suggested molecular
mechanism that pld is involved in insulin-like growth factor
i ( xxxg1144xxx )-induced erk activation in chinese hamster ovary
(cho) cells (banno et al., 2003). furthermore, we found that
 xxxg1772xxx  can mediate the activation of the mapk pathway by
interacting with ptdins(3,4,5)p3, the product of pi3k activity
(fig. 5). taken together, we suggest that  xxxg1772xxx  is a novel
ptdins(3,4,5)p3-binding protein that can mediate pi3k
signaling.
ptdins(4,5)p2 has been considered to be a major regulator of
 xxxg1772xxx  in enzymatic activity and cellular localization by binding
to the ph domain of  xxxg1772xxx  (hodgkin et al., 2000). although
ptdins(3,4,5)p3 has also been reported to activate  xxxg1772xxx  in
vitro, the mechanism involved is unclear. for example,
ptdins(3,4,5)p3 activated  xxxg1772xxx , purified from insect (sf9)
cells, in the presence of arf (hammond et al., 1997; min et
al., 1998) or rac1 (hodgkin et al., 2000). under our assay
conditions, we found that ptdins(4,5)p2 and ptdins(3,4,5)p3
stimulated the activity of wild-type  xxxg1772xxx  almost equally when
gtp␥s and arf were added (data not shown), which is in
agreement with min et al. (min et al., 1998). in the absence of
arf, however, activation of  xxxg1772xxx  by ptdins(3,4,5)p3 was
about 1.3-fold stronger than that by ptdins(4,5)p2 (fig. 4).
differences between the activation potentials of ptdins(4,5)p2

ptdins(3,4,5)p3- xxxg1772xxx  px interaction
in the presence or absence of arf might be due to its abilities
to directly bind to arf (randazzo, 1997) and to stimulate
gdp dissociation and gtp binding of arf (terui et al., 1994).
in conclusion, we suggest that the px domain of  xxxg1772xxx  plays
a role in the ptdins(3,4,5)p3-dependent activation of  xxxg1772xxx  in
vitro. we also demonstrate for the first time that  xxxg1772xxx  can be
activated by ptdins(3,4,5)p3 through direct interaction in cells
(figs 5 and 6).
in the present study, we observed that the activation of  xxxg1772xxx 
in vitro and in vivo depends on the interaction of  xxxg1772xxx  px
with ptdins(3,4,5)p3. another example of the pxphosphoinositide-interaction-dependent enzymatic activation
was reported for cytokine-independent survival kinase (cisk)
(virbasius et al., 2001). this study suggested that binding of
the cisk px domain to ptdins(3)p is required for its
localization to endosomes and for the activation of cisk
protein kinase by  xxxg1144xxx  or egf. these results suggest a new
feature of the px domains not only for the translocation but
also for the activation of px-domain-containing proteins.
furthermore, in addition to its phosphoinositide-binding
pocket,  xxxg1772xxx  px has a phosphorylation site for protein kinase
c (pkc) and can thus be phosphorylated, which enables  xxxg1772xxx 
to be activated upon agonist stimulation (kim et al., 2000).
therefore, the px domain of  xxxg1772xxx  is probably a center for
fine-tuning and modulating enzymatic activity and localization
of  xxxg1772xxx .
an nmr structural study of the  xxxg1508xxx  px domain showed
that, binding of the sh3 domain to the pxxp motif caused
a shift in the nmr signals of residues within its
phosphoinositide-binding pocket (hiroaki et al., 2001), and
that the lipid binding also causes a shift of residues within the
pxxp motif (cheever et al., 2001). this suggests that
the binding properties of these two distinct motifs (the
phosphoinositide-binding pocket and the pxxp motif) in the px
domain are allosterically regulated by each other. recently, we
reported that the px domains of pld interact with the sh3
domain of plc␥1 through their pxxp motifs, and that this
interaction is crucial for egf-induced plc␥1 activation and
intracellular ca2+ mobilization (jang et al., 2003). taken
together, the pld px domains might be multiple-binding
modules and might have multifunctionality in order to
coordinate signaling from receptors. it is not clear, however,
whether protein-binding to the  xxxg1772xxx  px domain alters the
nature of the lipid-px interaction or vice versa. so it would be
interesting to characterize the affinity and the activity profiles
of the  xxxg1772xxx  px domain by using a combination of binding
proteins and ptdins(3,4,5)p3.
pdgf stimulates a number of cellular responses following
its binding to the specific cell surface receptor and the
activation of intrinsic  xxxg2198xxx  (ullrich and
schlessinger, 1990; williams, 1989). although the main
upstream signals of pdfg-induced pld activation have been
ascribed to the arf, rho (shome et al., 1998), ral, pkc and
plc␥ (lee et al., 1994; voss et al., 1999; yeo et al., 1994)
pathways, no direct evidence concerning the isotype-specific
activation mechanism of  xxxg1772xxx  by pdgf has been available.
in this study, we identified pi3k as a novel signaling molecule
that specifically activates  xxxg1772xxx  but not  xxxg1773xxx  upon pdgf
stimulation (fig. 6). thus, pdgf-induced  xxxg1772xxx  activation can
be mediated by pi3k as well as smgs and by the plc␥-pkc
pathway for a fine-tuned regulation in cells.

 xxxg1772xxx  localizes in diverse subcellular membrane structures,
including the endoplasmic reticulum (er), golgi complex,
endosomes, lysosomes and in the plasma membrane (brown et
al., 1998; jones et al., 1999; kim et al., 1999; roth et al., 1999;
toda et al., 1999). in this study, we found that ptdins(3,4,5)p3
binds to the px domain of  xxxg1772xxx  and induces its localization
in plasma membrane. in case of wild-type  xxxg1772xxx , regulation of
localization is performed by complex mechanisms. hodgkin et
al. reported that the deletion mutant of  xxxg1772xxx  (⌬ph- xxxg1772xxx ),
which lacked the ph domain, showed a punctate distribution
in iic9 cells (hodgkin et al., 2000). in addition, we previously
reported that palmitoylation is important for the localization of
 xxxg1772xxx  in caveolin-enriched membranes (cem) (han et al.,
2002). thus it is thought that the determination of  xxxg1772xxx 
localization is achieved by the coordinated effect of lipid
modification, px-pi(3,4,5)p3-binding, interaction of ph
domain and polybasic motif-pi(4,5)p2, as well as, presumably,
by association with binding proteins in the membrane.
furthermore, considering that the full-length  xxxg1772xxx (r179k)
mutant, which cannot bind to pi(3,4,5)p3, still showed a
localization pattern similar to the one of wild type  xxxg1772xxx  (data
now shown), we speculate that the combination of
palmitoylation and pi(4,5)p2-binding is a major determinant
for  xxxg1772xxx  to localize in the plasma membrane. after that,
binding of  xxxg1772xxx  to px-pi(3,4,5)p3 occurs, thereby generating
additional linkage to the plasma membrane. nevertheless, there
remains a discrepancy in terms of the localization of full-length
 xxxg1772xxx . recently, du et al. showed that the px domain of  xxxg1772xxx 
participates in the recycling of  xxxg1772xxx  into perinuclear vesicles
after pma stimulation of cos-7 cells (du et al., 2003), thereby
identifying  xxxg1772xxx  px as a recycling regulatory domain. in
nih-3t3 cells, however, we observed no dramatic effects of
 xxxd2523xxx  in the localization of wild-type  xxxg1772xxx  (data not
shown). to clarify this issue, extensive studies concerning cell
type specificity, experimental conditions, mutant comparisons
and lipid modifications will be necessary.
