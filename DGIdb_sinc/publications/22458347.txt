abstract
1.  xxxd2529xxx  is a tissue-targeting, dual endothelin receptor antagonist, currently under phase 3 investigation in
pulmonary arterial hypertension.
2. in this study the disposition and metabolism of  xxxd2529xxx  were investigated following administration of a single
oral 10 mg dose of 14c- xxxd2529xxx  to six healthy male subjects.
3. the total radioactivity in matrices was determined using liquid scintillation counting. the proposed structure of
metabolites was based on mass spectrometry characteristics and, when available, confirmed by comparison with
reference compounds.
4. mean (± sd) cumulative recovery of radioactivity from faeces and urine was 73.6% (±6.2%) of the administered
radioactive dose, with 49.7% (±3.9%) cumulative recovery from urine, and 23.9% (±4.8%) from faeces. in plasma,
in addition to parent  xxxd2529xxx , act-132577, a pharmacologically active metabolite elicited by oxidative
depropylation and the carboxylic acid metabolite act-373898 were identified. in urine, four entities were
identified, with the hydrolysis product of act-373898 as the most abundant one. in faeces, five entities were
identified, with the hydrolysis product of  xxxd2529xxx  and act-132577 as the most abundant one. concentrations
of total radioactivity in whole blood were lower compared to plasma, which indicates that  xxxd2529xxx  and its
metabolites poorly bind to or penetrate into erythrocytes.

introduction

sidharta et al. 2011). maximum plasma concentrations
of  xxxd2529xxx  are achieved approximately 8 hours after
oral dosing in humans. the terminal elimination halflife (t1/2) is approximately 16 hours. after multiple dosing the pharmacokinetics (pk) are proportional over
the tested dose range (1–30 mg); steady state is achieved
by day 3 and  xxxd2529xxx  accumulates approximately
1.5 fold. in plasma, besides  xxxd2529xxx , act-132577,
a pharmacologically active metabolite of  xxxd2529xxx 
has a t1/2 of about 48 h (sidharta et al. 2011; kummer
et al. 2009; sidharta et al. 2008). the t1/2 of  xxxd2529xxx 
and its main metabolite is in accordance with a once
daily dosing regimen. formation of act-132577 in

 xxxd2529xxx  ( xxxd2529xxx , n-[5-(4-bromophenyl)-6-(2(5-bromopyrimidin-2-yloxy)ethoxy)pyrimidin-4-yl]n′-propylsulfuric diamide)) is a tissue-targeting, dual
endothelin receptor antagonist, under phase 3 investigation in pulmonary arterial hypertension.  xxxd2529xxx 
is a lipophilic compound, which inhibits endothelin
receptors eta and etb. it has been hypothesised that
by targeting both endothelin receptors with a high tissue affinity,  xxxd2529xxx  could constitute a new therapeutic approach in the management of pulmonary
arterial hypertension or other diseases in which the
tissue endothelin system is activated (iglarz et al. 2008;

man is predominantly catalyzed by cytochrome p450
(sidharta et al. 2010). there are no notable differences
in pharmacokinetic parameters of  xxxd2529xxx  and its
active metabolite between males and females and/or
between caucasian and japanese subjects (bruderer
et al. 2011). in addition,  xxxd2529xxx  can be given to
subjects irrespective of food intake.
the objectives of this study were to determine the
mass balance, to identify the clearance routes of  xxxd2529xxx  and its metabolites, and to detect the compoundrelated entities in plasma, urine, and faeces. comparison
of metabolite profiling in human with animal toxicity
studies will help to identify possible unique human
metabolites. we report the identification of metabolites
of  xxxd2529xxx  in humans by liquid chromatography followed by on-line mass spectrometry (ms) and fraction
collection in 96-well solid scintillation plates (ssc) for
off-line scintillation counting (topcount). the structures
of metabolites were established or confirmed by high
resolution ms and/or comparison with synthetic standards. the concentrations of  xxxd2529xxx  and its active
metabolite act-132577 were determined by a validated
liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry
(lc-ms/ms) assay.

materials and methods
subjects and study design
the clinical part of this study was conducted at covance
clinical research unit ag, allschwil, switzerland, after
approval of the study protocol by the ethics committee
of both cantons of basel, switzerland. the study was
conducted in full conformity with the principles of the
declaration of helsinki and the ema note for guidance
on good clinical practice (cpmp/ich/135/95).
after providing informed consent, six subjects were
screened for eligibility between 14 and 3 days prior to
dosing. demography, previous and concomitant medications, and a medical history were documented, and
safety assessments were performed. male subjects aged
45–65 years, with body mass index between 18 and 28 kg/
m2 (inclusive) were eligible for this study. in addition,
previous treatment with any prescribed or over-thecounter medications within 2 weeks prior to screening
and exposure to artificial ionizing radiation (e.g. x-ray,
thyroid scan) in the 12-month period before screening
were not permitted.
it was planned that all subjects remain in the study
centre from the evening of day -1 until at least 14 days
thereafter. subjects received on day 1 a single dose
of 10 mg 14c-labelled  xxxd2529xxx  (specific radioactivity 0.164 mbq/mmol (4.43 µci/mmol), radiochemical
purity 95.3%, manufactured by aptuit edinburgh uk),
as one capsule. target radioactivity was 2.78 mbq,
which is equivalent to 970 musv (sievert). this target
radioactivity was based on tissue exposure data in
rats and pk in humans. according to the international
commission on radiological protection, this additional


radiation exposure poses no relevant risk for human
subjects (valentin 2007). the subjects could be discharged from the study centre only if the amount of
plasma radioactivity on day 13 did not exceed 6% of the
maximum radioactivity measured in plasma (attained
between 0 to 72 hours post-dose). the criterion of 6%
of maximum radioactivity in plasma was set based on
the fact that after 4 elimination half-lives of a drug following one-compartment pk, approximately 94% of its
maximum concentration in plasma is eliminated. cmax
of  xxxd2529xxx  and its active metabolite act-132577 are
attained approximately 8 h and 48 h after dose administration, respectively. it was estimated that maximum
plasma radioactivity would be attained between 0 to
72 h post-dose and 94% of it should be eliminated
before day 13. in case a subject would have to remain
longer in the study centre, the collection of blood (once
daily sampling), urine, and faeces continued until the
radioactivity in plasma would be below the predefined
threshold of 6%. during their residence in the study
centre, subjects received standardized meals.
an end of study (eos) examination was performed
immediately after the last blood, urine, and faeces samplings had been performed. from screening until eos
examination, the subjects had to refrain from strong
physical exercise and strenuous sports activities (endurance sports), and were not allowed to consume any alcoholic beverages, grapefruit, or grapefruit juice. drinking
of xanthine-containing beverages was not permitted
during the time spent in the clinic.

sample collection
blood samples were drawn through an indwelling catheter or by direct venipuncture for at least 14 days at 1, 3,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192,
216, 240, 264, 288, and 312 h after  xxxd2529xxx  dosing for
analysis of total radioactivity and pharmacokinetics in
blood and plasma, and metabolite profiling in plasma.
at each sampling time point a total of 18 ml blood
was collected in ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid
(edta)-containing tubes. 3 ml of collected blood was
transferred to pre-labelled tubes for total radioactivity measurement in whole blood. within 30 min after
collection, the remaining blood was centrifuged at
4°c at 1500g for 10 min, and plasma was separated. all
plasma and blood tubes were stored in an upright position at −20°c or below until transferred to the analyzing
laboratory.
all urine and faeces were collected after dosing for
analysis of total radioactivity and metabolite profiling.
two samples of 10 ml of each collected 24-hour urine
volume were stored in an upright position at −20°c or
below until transferred to the analyzing laboratory.
faeces collection started after study drug intake and
continued until the end of the hospitalization period at
eos. faecal samples were frozen as soon as possible and
stored at −80 °c in an upright position until transferred to
the analyzing laboratory.

measurement of total radioactivity in plasma, whole blood,
faeces, and urine
total radioactivity was determined using a liquid scintillation counter, tricarb 2800tr (perkinelmer life and
analytical sciences, downers grove, il, usa).
pre-dose plasma, whole blood, urine, and faeces samples were measured and served as background radiation.
for determination of total radioactivity in plasma, whole
blood, urine, and faeces, the limit of quantification was
set to 10 disintegrations per minute (dpm) after subtraction of background.
faeces: each faeces sample, delivered deep-frozen to
the analytical laboratory, was separately freeze-dried
(alpha 2–4 ld freeze-dryer from christ gmbh, osterode,
germany) for at least 72 h, and weighed. the dried samples were homogenized and four aliquots (approximately
20–30 mg) were transferred to glass scintillation vials. 300
mul water (milli-q plus, volketswil, switzerland) and then
1 ml of tissue solubilizer (soluene 350®, perkinelmer
life and analytical sciences, downers grove, il, usa)
were added and incubated for one hour at 50°c, followed
by addition of 0.5 ml isopropanol (mallinckrodt baker,
deventer, the netherlands) and a further incubation time
of two hours at 50°c. after cooling at room temperature for
30 min, 500 mul of  xxxd2298xxx  (30%, fluka, buchs,
switzerland) were added drop wise and the solution was
allowed to stand for at least 30 min at 50°c to complete
the reaction. a volume of 0.25 ml hydrochloric acid (1.0
m, fluka, buchs, switzerland) was added. finally, 10 ml
of the scintillation cocktail (hionic fluor, perkinelmer
life and analytical sciences, downers grove, il, usa)
were added and the samples were incubated for at least
12 hours in the dark. each faeces sample was analysed in
triplicate. generally, the measurements were performed
for a counting time of 10 min.
whole blood: three aliquots of 300 mul (weighed) were
transferred into glass vials. under stirring a mixture of
0.75 ml of isopropanol and tissue solubiliser (soluene
350®) (2/1, v/v) was added and incubated for one hour
at approximately 50°c. after cooling at room temperature
0.5 ml of  xxxd2298xxx  (30%) was added drop wise
and the solution was allowed to stand for at least 15 min
to complete the reaction. thereafter, the vial was capped
and placed for at least 30 min in a water bath (water bath
sbk 25 d, salvis ag, reussbühl, switzerland) at approximately 50°c. after cooling at room temperature, 0.25 ml
hydrochloric acid (1.0 m) and 10 ml of the scintillation
cocktail (ultima gold, perkinelmer life and analytical
sciences, downers grove, il, usa) were added. prior to
scintillation counting, samples were allowed to adapt for
temperature and light for one hour. each whole blood
sample was analysed in triplicate.
plasma: three aliquots of 300 mul (weighed) were transferred into glass vials. the samples were mixed with 1 ml

of water and then with 10 ml of the scintillation cocktail
(ultima gold) while vortexing (vortex mixer ika, ikaworks inc., wilmington, nc, usa, and/or vortex genie
2, scientific industries inc., bohemia, ny, usa). each
plasma sample was analysed in triplicate.
urine: two aliquots of 300 mul (weighed) were transferred
into glass vials. the samples were mixed with 10 ml of
the scintillation cocktail (ultima gold) while vortexing.
each urine sample was analysed in duplicate.

metabolite profiling in plasma, urine, and faeces
for metabolite profiling, selected samples were pooled.
plasma pools were prepared by combining a fixed volume
of samples collected at the following time points from all
six subjects, pool 1: time points 1 and 3 h, pool 2: 5 and
6 h, pool 3: 7 and 8 h, pool 4: 9 and 10 h, pool 5: 12 and
16 h, pool 6: 24 and 48 h, pool 7: 72 and 96 h, pool 8: 120
and 144 h, pool 9: 168 and 192 h, pool 10: 216 and 240 h,
pool 11: 264–336 h. the pooled plasma samples were
precipitated by acn (acetonitrile, mallinckrodt baker,
deventer, the netherlands)/etoh (ethanol, mallinckrodt
baker, deventer, the netherlands). each sample supernatant was analysed by separation with hplc followed
by fraction collection and on-line ms-detection. the
fractions were collected in 96-well ssc plates and dried
for subsequent off-line scintillation counting (topcount
nxt, perkinelmer life and analytical sciences, downers
grove, il, usa). a luna c18 (2), 4.6 × 250 mm id, 5
µm analytical column (phenomenex, aschaffenburg,
germany) was used. the mobile phases consisted of
water containing 1%  xxxd2154xxx  (v/v, purchased from
riedel de haen, puriss ( xxxg2186xxx  laborchemikalien gmbh),
seelze germany) (phase a), and acn (phase b). the flow
rate was 1 ml/min. fixed percentages (by volume) of
selected time intervals of all six subjects were combined
to prepare urine sample pools. the pooled urine samples
were injected without further work-up onto the hplc
column, followed by online ms-detection as well as online fraction collection in 96-well ssc plates for off-line
scintillation counting (topcount).
fixed percentages (by weight) of freeze-dried, homogenized faeces samples of selected time intervals of all six
subjects were combined to prepare the faeces sample
pools. the time intervals used for preparation of each
urine and faeces pool samples are as follows: pool 1:
0–24 h, pool 2: 24–48 h, pool 3: 48–72 h, pool 4: 72–96 h,
pool 5: 96–120 h, pool 6: 120–168 h, pool 7: 168–216 h,
pool 8: 216–264 h, pool 9: 264–336 h.
each dried faeces pool was extracted, by using
approximately 10 v/w (i.e. 4 ml per 400 mg faeces) of
acn/h2o (50/50, v/v). following the addition of the
solvent, samples were vortex-mixed for 30 min and
allowed to stand. thereafter, samples were centrifuged
for 10 min at 4000 rpm and 8°c. after centrifugation the
supernatant was decanted off. this process was repeated
one more time. both supernatants were combined and
evaporated to dryness by nitrogen gas (messer schweiz

ag, lenzburg, schweiz) and dissolved in 200 mul of a mixture of acn/h2o (30/70, v/v). 50 mul were injected onto
the hplc column followed by on-line ms-detection as
well as on-line fraction collection in 96-well ssc plates
for off-line scintillation counting (topcount).
the recovery of radioactivity after sample preparation
was determined for all matrix samples. for one representative faeces sample, the recovery of radioactivity was
also determined after extraction and before reconstitution of the sample. in addition, the column recoveries
after chromatography were determined for each matrix
with one representative sample.
a ltq (linear trap quadrupole) mass spectrometer
(thermofisher scientific, san jose, ca, usa)was used for
structure identification of the metabolites of  xxxd2529xxx 
in plasma, urine, and faeces. the esi (electrospray ionization) source was set in positive and negative ion mode
and analytical conditions were set as follows: esi voltage
4.0 kv, capillary temperature 350°c, mass-to-charge ratio
range 100–1000 thomson.
in order to gain more information about the identity of
selected metabolites a high resolution ltq orbitrap was
used at a resolving power of at least 30,000.
the synthetic standards, which were used as reference
to confirm retention times (rts) and structures of  xxxd2529xxx , act-132577, and act-373898, were synthesized
at actelion pharmaceuticals ltd.
analysis of  xxxd2529xxx  and act-132577 in plasma
the concentration of  xxxd2529xxx  and its active metabolite
act-132577 in plasma was determined using a validated
lc-ms/ms method, as described previously (kummer
et al. 2009). k3-edta was used as an anticoagulant. the
lower limit of quantification (loq) in plasma was 1 ng/
ml for both analytes.
the concentrations of the analytes were determined using the internal standardization method.
tetradeuterated internal standards were used (actelion
pharmaceuticals ltd). the square of the correlation
coefficient (r2) of calibration curves was at least 0.9986
for  xxxd2529xxx , and 0.9934 for act-132577 in all runs.
for  xxxd2529xxx , the inter-day precision (coefficient of
variation) of quality control samples was <5.6% and the
inter-day inaccuracy was −5.3 to −0.2%. for act-132577,
inter-day precision was <9.9% and interday inaccuracy
was −4.0 to −0.7%. all samples were analysed within the
period, over which the analytes had been shown to be
stable.
pharmacokinetic analysis of  xxxd2529xxx  and act-132577 in
plasma, and total radioactivity in plasma and whole blood
maximum plasma concentration (cmax), time to reach
maximum plasma concentration (tmax), t½, area under
plasma concentration-time curve from zero to time t of
the last measured concentration above the loq (auc0–t),
area under plasma concentration-time curve from zero
to infinity (auc0–∞) of  xxxd2529xxx  and act-132577 in
plasma, total radioactivity in plasma and whole blood


were determined with model-independent methods,
using winnonlin professional version 5.0 (pharsight
corporation, mountain view, ca, usa).
based on the actual radioactive doses administered
to each subject, the specific activity of 14c- xxxd2529xxx  in
individual administered capsules (dpm/mg) was calculated, which in turn was used to calculate ng equivalents
of total radioactivity in plasma. pharmacokinetic parameters were descriptively analysed, calculating geometric
means and 95% confidence limits.

tolerability and safety
tolerability and safety were evaluated descriptively by
recording of serious adverse events (saes), adverse
events (aes), clinical laboratory variables, vital signs,
and 12-lead ecg during the study. clinical laboratory
variables and 12-lead ecg were assessed before study
drug administration and at eos, vital signs were assessed
before study drug administration, at different time points
on day 1, and every second day until eos.

results
six healthy male subjects (age range: 47–62 years, bmi
range: 24.7–27.4 kg/m2) were enrolled and all completed
the study as per protocol.
the amount of radioactivity of individual capsules
administered to each subject was between 2.750 and
2.754 mbq.
subjects 101, 104, and 106 were discharged in the
morning of day 14, whereas subjects 102, 103, and 105
were discharged in the morning of day 15.

excretion profiles in faeces and urine
the cumulative excretion of radioactivity in faeces and
urine is shown in figure 1. mean (± sd) total recovery of radioactivity from faeces and urine was 73.6% (±
6.2%) of the administered dose. the urinary excretion,
accounting for a mean (± sd) recovery of 49.7% (± 3.9%)
of the administered dose at the end of study, was a more

representative hplc radiochromatograms of plasma
pool 1 (time points 1 and 3 h), 3 (time points 7 and 8 h)
and 7 (time points 72 and 96 h), a urine pool collected
during the interval 48–72 h, and from a faeces pool sample collected during the interval 48–72 h are presented
in figure 2. in plasma, apart from parent  xxxd2529xxx ,
and the known oxidative depropylated metabolite, act132577, the carboxylic acid act-373898 was identified.
the retention times (rts) and chemical structures of

 xxxd2529xxx , act-132577, and act-373898 were confirmed with the synthetic standards as reference.
act-373898, which was first identified in this study, represented more than 20% of radioactivity of  xxxd2529xxx  and
about 8% of the total plasma radioactivity in the plasma
pools analysed (estimated in terms of total counts per minute [cpm] measured). act-132577 represented about 190%
of  xxxd2529xxx  and 60% of the total plasma radioactivity.
in urine, four entities were identified: the conjugate of
act-132577 with glucose (m 706 u), act-080803 resulting from hydrolysis of the sulfamide moiety of either
 xxxd2529xxx  or act-132577, act-373898, and its hydrolysis product (m 323 u).

act-373898 and m 323 u accounted for 22.9% and
26.0%, respectively, of radioactivity excreted in urine.
m 706 u and act-080803 accounted for 24.8% and 7%,
respectively, of radioactivity excreted in urine. neither
 xxxd2529xxx  nor act-132577 was present in urine.
in faeces, five entities were identified:  xxxd2529xxx ,
act-132577, act-373898, its hydrolysis product (m 323
u), and act-080803.
act-080803 was the major product present in faeces,
accounting for 37.7% of radioactivity excreted therein.
 xxxd2529xxx  and act-132577 represented 16.9% and
14.0%, respectively, of radioactivity excreted in faeces.
act-373898 and m 323 u accounted for 3.6% and 13.1%,
respectively, of radioactivity excreted in faeces.
in addition to the five above-mentioned products,
one minor metabolite, an oxidation product of  xxxd2529xxx  with a molecular weight of 602 u but unidentified
chemical structure, was also identified in faeces. m 602 u
accounted for 2% of radioactivity excreted in faeces.
the proposed metabolic pathways of  xxxd2529xxx  in
humans and chemical structure of metabolites are presented in figure 3.
the lc-ms/ms spectra of identified entities are presented in figure 4 and the fragmentation analysis is presented in table 1.
the recovery after extraction of 14c from plasma and
faeces was 100%, and 93.2%, respectively. the recovery after sample injection and separation on the hplc
column was around 100% for all matrices. the recovery
after reconstitution for faeces was around 50%. the low
recoveries after reconstitution are more likely explained
by the high concentrations of suspended sediment in
faeces samples, which may have hindered the complete
dissolution of the radioactive compounds in the dried


faeces extracts. the peaks resulting from radioactivity
profiling were found to be intensive. in general, a plausible and conclusive time profile was found. therefore, it
is not expected that the recovery after reconstitution, has
an influence on the results of the metabolic profiling.

analysis of  xxxd2529xxx , act-132577, and total
radioactivity in plasma and whole blood
mean ± sd plasma concentration-time profiles of total
radioactivity,  xxxd2529xxx , and act-132577 are shown in
figure 5.
 xxxd2529xxx  showed a slow absorption with a geometric mean cmax of 170 ng/ml, attained 6 h after dosing (ranging between 5 and 10 h) and a geometric mean
terminal t½ of 15 h. for act-132577, the cmax (geometric
mean 121 ng/ml) was attained 48 h after dosing and its
geometric mean terminal t½ was 44 h. the plasma concentration-time profile of total radioactivity (ng equiv./
ml) was also characterized by slow oral absorption. cmax
of total radioactivity (geometric mean 235 ng equiv./ml)
was attained after approximately 12 h (ranging between
7 and 24 h). total radioactivity concentrations in plasma
were higher than the sum of  xxxd2529xxx  and act-132577
concentrations at most of the time points. the geometric
mean terminal t½ of radioactivity in plasma was 103 h,
which was longer compared to terminal t½ of  xxxd2529xxx  (geometric mean 15 h) and act-132577 (geometric
mean 44 h). auc0-∞ of total radioactivity in plasma was
about 25% greater than the sum of auc0-∞ of  xxxd2529xxx 
and act-132577. for auc0-t, this difference was approximately 19% (table 2).
in whole blood, maximum total radioactivity (geometric mean 131 ng equiv./ml) was attained at 14 h (ranging
between 6 and 24 h). at 264 h, the amount of radioactivity

reached the limit of quantification for four subjects. only
one subject had quantifiable radioactivity in blood at
312 h post-dose.
geometric mean terminal t½ of total radioactivity in
whole blood was 43 h which was shorter than the terminal t½ of total radioactivity in plasma (geometric mean
103 h). concentrations of total radioactivity in whole
blood were lower compared to plasma. cmax and auc0-t
values of total radioactivity in plasma were about 80%

leading to study discontinuation. in total, three aes of
mild intensity were reported during the study, i.e. two
cases of hematochezia (presence of blood in faeces) and
one case of headache. no concomitant medication was
received during the study. all aes resolved spontaneously and without sequelae before the end of study.

discussion
mass balance: mean (± sd) cumulative recovery of radioactivity from faeces and urine was 73.6% ± 6.2% of the


administered dose. excretion involved both renal and
faecal routes and urine represented a more important
elimination route for  xxxd2529xxx ’s metabolites than faeces. a recent clinical study showed no clinically relevant
differences in pk of  xxxd2529xxx , act-132577, and act373898 between patients with mild, moderate or severe
hepatic impairment due to liver cirrhosis and healthy
subjects following a single oral dose of 10 mg  xxxd2529xxx . this observation is in line with the mass balance
outcome of the present study, which showed the urinary
route as the most important one. hepatic impairment
only moderately affects the pk of  xxxd2529xxx  and its
metabolites. a study in patients with renal impairment
is currently ongoing. the average radioactivity recovery
in this study was less than 80%. there might be several
reasons to explain this. technical issues during the conduct of the clinical study or bioanalytical work including
a careful control on procedural recovery upon sample
work-up were thoroughly checked and can be ruled out.
the loss of radioactivity through other routes, for example expired air, is not considered as relevant, given that
the radiolabel was placed in the core pyrimidine structure which was preserved in all metabolites structurally
identified in this study.
another possible explanation would be the long
half-life of total radioactivity in the circulation. it has
been reported that many compounds with a radioactivity half-life in plasma longer than 50 h do not reach
the 80% threshold of radioactive dose recovery (roffery
et al. 2007). the long plasma half-life of total radioactivity in this study (103 h) and slow elimination of radioactive material might have contributed to the incomplete
recovery of radioactivity in excreta. this is consistent
with the small amount of radioactivity excreted each
day, especially in faeces. maximum mean faecal excretion was on day 6 with only 4.3% of administered dose
(data not shown). since the amounts of radioactivity
excreted during the last days of sampling were very
low, with extended sample collections the amount of
excreted radioactivity would have reached soon the

loq and an accurate measurement would not be possible. possible enterohepatic recirculation of  xxxd2529xxx  and act-132577 has been investigated using the
tandem rat model. in these experiments enterohepatic
recirculation of  xxxd2529xxx  and act-132577 was not
evident. also in humans there were no indications of
enterohepatic recirculation of either compound. in the
rat and dog mass balance studies, excretion of radioactivity was complete at the end of the sample collection
period (216 h for rat, and 336 h for dog), which indicates
a rather slow excretion. on the other hand, the tissue
distribution of 14c-radiolabelled  xxxd2529xxx  investigated in rats indicated extensive distribution, with a
slow disposition into tissues. slow distribution to tissues
could be a possible explanation for the long half-life of
radioactivity observed in the present study (actelion
pharmaceuticals, data on file).
metabolite profiling: there were three, four, and five
entities in plasma, urine, and faeces, respectively. the
results of this study indicate that  xxxd2529xxx  undergoes
two major metabolic reactions:
1. oxidative depropylation to form act-132577. this
metabolite subsequently undergoes conjugation
with glucose to form m 706 u, which is eliminated in
urine. m 706 u was not present in faeces.
2. oxidative cleavage of the ethylene glycol linker to
form the carboxylic acid, act-373898, which in
turn undergoes hydrolysis to form m 323 u. both are
present in urine and faeces and constitute the major
radio-labelled products in urine.
both  xxxd2529xxx  and act-132577 can be chemically
hydrolyzed to the aminopyrimidine act-080803,
which is present in both urine and faeces, and is the
major radio-labelled product in faeces. both  xxxd2529xxx  and act-132577 are present in faeces.  xxxd2529xxx 
in faeces could reflect the non-absorbed fraction of
the dose.
the metabolites identified in humans had also been
detected in animal studies and the latter provided sufficient coverage for the human situation. in addition,
in vitro metabolic patterns with hepatocytes and liver
microsomes of rat, mouse, dog, and man were similar
(actelion pharmaceuticals, data on file). therefore, no
unique human metabolite was identified in this study. in
this study no metabolite structure was identified, which
would be indicative of a safety concern. based on in vitro
and in vivo toxicology studies there was no evidence of

genotoxicity with  xxxd2529xxx . in addition, in different
clinical studies with more than 300 healthy subjects, and
850 patients treated with different doses and for different
durations with  xxxd2529xxx  no safety concern has been
identified so far.
pk in plasma and blood: the plasma concentrationtime profiles of  xxxd2529xxx  and act-132577 were comparable with those in previous studies and are consistent
with a once-a-day dosing (kummer et al. 2009; sidharta
et al. 2011).
concentrations of total radioactivity in plasma were
greater compared to whole blood. ratio of total radioactivity concentration blood / plasma of 0.55 is close to the
theoretical minimum blood-to-plasma distribution ratio,
l − haematocrit = 0.57 (based on the haematocrit measurements performed at screening and eos). this indicates that  xxxd2529xxx  and its metabolites poorly bind to
or penetrate into erythrocytes. this is also in accordance
with in vitro data on blood/plasma cell partitioning,
which showed no notable uptake of either  xxxd2529xxx  or act-132577 into human erythrocytes (actelion
pharmaceuticals, data on file).

conclusion
in this study the disposition of  xxxd2529xxx  in man has
been well characterized and its metabolic pathways were
proposed, leading to the identified metabolites. urine
was the major route of elimination for  xxxd2529xxx ’s
metabolites in humans. in plasma, parent compound
 xxxd2529xxx , act-132577, a pharmacologically active
metabolite, and the carboxylic acid metabolite act373898 were identified.
