abstract
zinc is thought to be required as a structural component of the thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine, t3) receptor (tr). however, we have previously demonstrated that use of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid
(dtpa) to restrict zinc availability to cultured cells actually potentiates
rather than inhibits thyroid hormone action. in this article, the mechanisms
underlying these effects of dtpa have been investigated. treatment of
gh3 rat pituitary tumor cells with dtpa in the presence of t3 resulted in
twofold greater concentrations of  xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx  (gh) mrna. addition
of  xxxd1800xxx  d to inhibit transcription showed that gh mrna was actually less stable in the presence of dtpa, eliminating mrna stabilization as
a possible mechanism underlying this effect. cycloheximide was able to
block the induction by dtpa, showing a requirement for protein synthesis. transient transfection of a gh promoter/luciferase reporter construct
into gh3 cells revealed an inhibitory effect of dtpa on luciferase activity.
however, when cells were stably transfected with the same construct, a t3dependent stimulation of luciferase activity by dtpa was observed, mimicking the effects seen with the endogenous mrna. thus, the gh
promoter does mediate the effects of dtpa, but stable integration into
chromosomal material is required.

introduction
zinc participates in a large and diverse array of biological processes.
its size and charge characteristics, coordination flexibility, and inability to
undergo oxidation or reduction favor its incorporation into biological
macromolecules, most notably enzymes and transcription factors (1).
within the nucleus, zinc is used by a wide array of transcription factors,
usually to stabilize structures that permit binding to dna (2). included
among these transcription factors are the members of the steroid/thyroid
receptor superfamily that mediate the effects of a large number of hormone, nutrient, and other ligands on gene transcription (3). these receptors all contain nine invariant cysteine residues in their dna-binding
domain, eight of which coordinate two atoms of zinc and are essential for
receptor function (4,5).
the description of zinc biochemistry is becoming more complete and
much is known of its physiology, including its requirement for growth and
proper function of numerous organ systems (1). however, links between
the biochemistry and physiology are tenuous at this time. for example, it
is not clear which particular biochemical events lead to the growth failure
of zinc deficiency (6). it has been suggested that transcription factors might
bind zinc with lower affinity than enzymes and, under conditions of deficiency, might be more subject to zinc loss and, therefore, interrupted function (7). consequently, we developed the hypothesis that some of the
effects of zinc deficiency might be mediated by loss of zinc from nuclear
receptors and, therefore, failure of these endocrine/nutrient signaling
pathways. we tested this hypothesis using the thyroid  xxxg1603xxx 
(tr). thyroid hormone, specifically its active metabolite triiodothyronine
(t3), affects a diverse array of biological processes (8). like zinc, its deficiency leads to failures in growth and development.
gh3 rat pituitary tumor cells have been widely used to investigate t3
action (9). t3 stimulates  xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx  (gh) gene transcription in these
cells and the details of this process, including tr interaction with the gh
promoter, have been well described (10,11). therefore, we tested the effects
of limiting zinc availability to these cells by the addition of a chelator
(diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, dtpa) to the media (12,13). surprisingly, dtpa enhanced, rather than inhibited, induction of gh expression
by t3. this effect was not seen in the absence of t3 and could be blocked
by equimolar addition of zinc, although not other divalent cations. dtpa
effects on gh mrna were slow (24 h) and could be reversed by subsequent addition of zinc. thus, it appeared likely that they were caused by
an effect of zinc loss on the production or activity of a protein involved in
the t3 signaling pathway. however, this protein did not appear to be the
tr itself, because the t3 binding of this protein was not affected by either
dtpa or zinc (12,13).
our objective in the work reported here was to probe the mechanisms
underlying these surprising effects of zinc chelation on thyroid hormone

action. we demonstrate that dtpa appears to act at the transcriptional
level, although stable rather than transient transfections were required to
see this effect.

materials and methods
cell culture
gh3 rat pituitary tumor cells, obtained from the american type culture collection (atcc), were grown and maintained in monolayer culture
with ham’s f-10 medium containing penicillin (50,000 iu/ l) and streptomycin (50 mg/l) supplemented with horse serum (15%) and newborn calf
serum (2.5%) as described previously (12).

transcriptional inhibition studies
gh3 cells were grown to confluence in 25-cm2 flasks. for the 48 h
prior to treatment, standard medium was replaced with ham’s f-10 containing antibiotics and 10% newborn calf serum, depleted of endogenous
hormones by an ion-exchange resin (t3-free media) (14). medium was
replaced with fresh t3-free media and the flasks treated with 10 nm t3
with or without 50 µm dtpa for a second 48-h period. media were then
supplemented with the transcriptional inhibitor  xxxd1800xxx  d (1.4 µm)
and rna extracted at different times over the subsequent 16 h.

translational inhibition studies
gh3 cells were grown to confluence and pretreated with t3-free
media for 48 h. medium was replaced with fresh t3-free medium and the
cells treated with 10 nm t3 with or without 50 µm dtpa. after 24 h, cycloheximide (25 µm) was added to one-half the flasks to inhibit protein synthesis, and incubation continued for a further 24 h, at which time cells
were processed for rna extraction.

rna extraction and northern analysis
total rna was isolated using a modified peppel/baglioni protocol
as reported previously (12). equivalent amounts of rna were size separated on 1% agarose–6% formaldehyde denaturing gels and transferred
onto nitrocellulose membranes (msi nitropure, westborough, ma). after
ultraviolet (uv) crosslinking and baking, the membranes were
hybridized separately with 32p-labeled gh and ribosomal protein l32
(rpl32) cdna probes, synthesized using a random primer labeling kit
(life technologies, rockville, md). hybridization was carried out
overnight at 42°c as previously described (12). after posthybridization

washes, the membranes were autoradiographed at –80°c with an intensifying screen, and the resulting images were quantified using molecular
analyst software for the gs-670 densitometer (bio-rad, hercules, ca).
the mrna levels are expressed as the ratio between densitometric signals measured for gh and rpl32.

transfection assays
the rat gh promoter (–530 basepairs; gift of h. samuels, new york
university, ny) (15) was subcloned into the  xxxg2041xxx -basic luciferase
reporter plasmid (promega, madison, wi). the pcmv-betagal plasmid
(stratagene, la jolla, ca) was used to control for transfection efficiency.
for transient transfection, gh3 cells were grown to confluence in 75-cm2
flasks (approx 17.5 × 106 cells). cells were detached, pelleted, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs). plasmid dna (10 µg of
each) was added and the cells incubated on ice for 10 min. cells were
transferred to a sterile cuvet, placed in the gene pulser ii electroporator
(bio-rad), and pulsed at 250 v and 975 µf for 10–16 ms. cells were then
resuspended in ham’s f-10 medium containing 10% newborn calf
serum without t3, aliquoted to a six-well plate, and incubated for 48 h
in the presence of different combinations of t3 (10 nm), dtpa (50 µm),
and/or  xxxd3557xxx  (40 µm). cells were harvested for luciferase activity
and beta-galactosidase activity using the appropriate kits (promega).
luciferase activity was determined using a td-20/20 luminometer
(turner designs, sunnyvale, ca) and beta-galactosidase measured in an
ultrospec plus spectrophotometer (pharmacia lkb biotechnology, piscataway, nj).
for stable transfections, the  xxxg2041xxx /gh plasmid was transfected into
gh3 cells by electroporation as earlier, but replacing the pcmv-betagal with
the pc1neo vector (2 µg; promega). cells were returned to culture flasks
and treated with  xxxg418xxx  (500 µg/ml; promega). parallel treatment of nontransfected cells demonstrated that this concentration was sufficient to kill
all cells not expressing the neomycin transferase gene. pooled cultures of
stably transfected cells were developed and maintained with the addition
of 200 µg/ml  xxxg418xxx  to the growth medium. cells were treated with combinations of t3, dtpa, and  xxxd3557xxx  and luciferase activity measured as
for the transiently transfected cells. protein concentration was measured in
the cell lysates (16) and used to standardize luciferase activity.

statistical analysis
each treatment was replicated two to three times within an experiment and each experiment was repeated two to four times. data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (anova) followed by scheffe’s
post hoc test to determine group differences. the significance level was set
at p<0.05.

transcriptional inhibition studies
 xxxd1800xxx  d was used to determine the role for mrna stabilization in the t3-dependent induction of gh mrna by dtpa. cells pretreated with t3 and dtpa contained more than twofold greater
concentrations of gh mrna than those pretreated with t3 alone (see fig.
1). gh mrna concentrations remained stable over a 16-h exposure to  xxxd1800xxx  d in cells treated with t3 alone. however, in cells also treated
with dtpa, gh mrna levels decreased over time (p<0.05; fig. 1). thus,
gh mrna appeared to be less stable in cells incubated in the presence of
50 µm dtpa than in its absence.

translational inhibition studies
in the absence of cycloheximide, dtpa approximately doubled the
stimulatory effects of t3 on the accumulation of gh mrna over a 48-h

cells. gh3 cells were treated with t3 (10 nm) with or without dtpa (50 µm). after
24 h, cycloheximide was added to half of the flasks. incubation was continued for
a further 24 h, at which time rna was extracted and gh mrna assessed by
northern analysis. values were standardized with rpl32 mrna, measured on
the same blots. bars represent the means ± sem of four independent experiments,
each with a minimum of two observations per treatment group. bars with different letters are significantly different (p<0.05).

treatment period (see fig. 2), as seen in previous studies. however, the
addition of cycloheximide, 24 h prior to rna extraction, although not
affecting gh mrna in control and t3-treated cells, partially reduced
expression in cells treated with t3 plus dtpa, so that it was no longer different from those found in cells treated with t3 alone. exposure of cells to
cycloheximide for the full 48 h of t3/dtpa treatment drastically reduced
expression in all treatment groups (data not shown), suggesting a generalized toxic effect of the inhibitor.

transfection assays
initially, transient transfection studies were performed with the gh
promoter–luciferase reporter construct and the cells treated with t3,
dtpa, and zinc, as described in the materials and methods section. activity derived from the cotransfected beta-galactosidase plasmid did not vary
with these treatments. t3 treatment of these transiently transfected cells
had only minor effects on luciferase activity (see fig. 3). the addition of

promoter in gh3 cells. gh3 cells were transiently transfected with the rgh/ xxxg2041xxx 
basic plasmid, together with pcmv-betagal by electroporation. they were treated
with t3-free media (controls), t3 (10 nm), dtpa (50 µm), and zns04 (40 µm) as
shown. after 48 h, cells were harvested for assay of luciferase and beta-galactosidase
activities. bars represent means ± sem, n=3. similar results were seen in two additional experiments. bars not sharing the same letter are significantly different
(p<0.05).

dtpa reduced luciferase activity to about 20% of that seen in controls. this
effect was apparent both in the presence and absence of t3. coaddition of
40 µm  xxxd3557xxx  restored luciferase activity to levels not different from
control cells, again regardless of t3. because these effects were quite different from those observed for these treatments on gh mrna in nontransfected cells, gh mrna expression was also measured in these
transiently transfected cells (see fig. 4). in contrast to the results seen with
luciferase activity, dtpa stimulated gh mrna expression. t3 alone doubled gh mrna expression and dtpa in the presence of t3 resulted in a
fourfold further increase in mrna concentrations. dtpa was without
effect in the absence of t3. thus, the transiently transfected gh promoter
responded to dtpa quite differently than the endogenous gh mrna,
even within the same cells.
transfections were repeated, replacing the pcmv-betagal with the
pc1neo plasmid. this plasmid encodes a neomycin-resistance gene and,
therefore, allows selection with the  xxxg418xxx  antibiotic and the generation of

stably transfected cell lines. addition of  xxxg418xxx  resulted in the death of all
nontransfected cells, demonstrating the requirement for pc1neo expression for survival. isolated colonies of the transfected cells survived this
treatment. these cells were pooled to give a mixed colony of stably transfected cells. treatment of these cells with t3 for 48 h resulted in twofold
greater reporter gene activity and this activity was enhanced a further
twofold by coaddition of dtpa (see fig. 5). this stimulatory effect of dtpa
was blocked by  xxxd3557xxx  and, importantly, was not seen in the absence
of t3. these treatment effects on the transgene are similar to those seen
with gh mrna in nontransfected cells. this similarity was confirmed by
extracting rna from stably transfected cells, following treatment with
t3/dtpa/zinc and measuring the endogenous gh mrna expression.
dtpa stimulated gh mrna expression in a manner requiring the presence of t3 and reversible by zinc (data not shown).

discussion
our initial attempts to explain some of the physiological effects of zinc
deficiency through loss of zinc and, therefore, interrupted function of the
nuclear t3 receptors resulted in findings of enhanced signaling through

fig. 5. dtpa and t3 stimulate gh promoter activity in stably transfected
gh3 cells. gh3 cells were transfected with the rgh/ xxxg2041xxx  basic plasmid, together
with pc1neo by electroporation. after treatment with  xxxg418xxx , colonies of stably
transfected cells developed and were pooled. cells were treated with t3-free
media (controls), t3 (10 nm), dtpa (50 µm), and znso4 (40 µm) as shown. after
48 h, cells were harvested for assay of luciferase, which was corrected for protein
concentration of the cell lysates. bars represent means ± sem, n=3. similar results
were seen in three additional experiments. bars not sharing the same letter are significantly different (p<0.05).

the t3 signaling pathway in zinc-restricted cells (12,13). zinc restriction
was achieved by the use of dtpa, a chelator with a high affinity for zinc
(17). although dtpa can also bind other cations with lower affinity, in our
experiments equimolar zinc is uniquely able to block the effects of this
chelator (12). dtpa also has the advantage of being membrane impermeable, binding zinc in the media and thus restricting its availability to the
cells, but avoiding the more extreme perturbations of zinc that can occur
with chelators that enter cells. although disproving the starting hypothesis and leaving open the question of the mechanism underlying the growth
failure of zinc deficiency, these experiments did indicate previously unsuspected roles for zinc within the nucleus, which appeared worthy of additional investigation.
to determine if a change in mrna stability is the mechanism behind
dtpa enhancement of gh gene expression, studies with  xxxd1800xxx  d
were undertaken.  xxxd1800xxx  d is an inhibitor of transcription, allowing

the rate of disappearance of mrna to be examined. cells treated with t3
and  xxxd1800xxx  d had very stable gh mrna concentrations, which did
not change over 16 h. this slow rate of change in mrna levels is consistent with previous studies that report that gh mrna has a half-life >50 h
(18). longer incubations with  xxxd1800xxx  d resulted in generalized toxicity and cell death, precluding accurate measurement of the gh mrna
half-life with this approach. however, in cells treated with t3 and dtpa
and exposed to  xxxd1800xxx  d, gh mrna concentrations diminished
over time, suggesting that the stability of gh mrna is actually decreased
by exposure to dtpa. therefore, increased mrna stability cannot explain
the induction of gh mrna expression in the presence of dtpa, pointing
to transcription as the regulated step.
cycloheximide was then used to determine if blocking protein synthesis could reduce or eliminate the dtpa effect. this metabolic inhibitor
did not affect gh mrna in control cells or those treated with t3 alone.
however, expression was reduced in cells treated with t3 and dtpa, such
that a significant enhancement of gh mrna by dtpa was no longer
observed. again, this experiment was complicated by the extended halflife of gh mrna and, therefore, its slow response to factors influencing its
expression. for this reason, the cycloheximide was added 24 h after the
t3/dtpa. adding it simultaneously might have not only completely
blocked any dtpa effect but also resulted in cellular death. thus, ongoing
protein synthesis is a requirement for the enhancement of t3-induced gene
expression by dtpa.
a chimeric gh promoter/luciferase reporter plasmid was next used
in transfection studies to see whether the dtpa effect was at the transcriptional level, mediated by the gh promoter, and also as a first step to
determine the cis-acting elements within that promoter that were
required. however, when a transient transfection approach was utilized,
little or no response to t3 was observed. frequently, cotransfection of an
expression vector encoding t3 receptors has been required to optimize the
response under these circumstances (10,19). this possibility was not pursued because the effect of dtpa itself on the gh/luciferase construct was
inhibitory rather than stimulatory and was independent of t3. thus, the
whole transfection model was not replicating the behavior of the endogenous gh mrna. gh3 cells proved resistant to transfection by the calcium phosphate procedure or by the cationic detergents, therefore
requiring the use of electroporation. this is a more extreme method for
making the cell membranes permeable to the exogenous dna. one possible explanation for the differential response was that damage to the cellular membranes from electroporation resulted in cellular access for the
normally membrane-impermeable dtpa and, therefore, an altered effect
on zinc distribution. this possibility was tested by analyzing endogenous
gh mrna expression in transfected gh3 cells, treated in parallel with t3
and dtpa. the responses of gh mrna expression in these cells were
identical to those observed in nontransfected cells, thus eliminating the
biological trace element research

possibility that membrane damage might explain the differential response
of the transgene.
a second concern was that the elements of the gh promoter mediating the effects of dtpa lay outside the 530-bp region utilized in the
transfection experiments. although this region was chosen precisely
because it includes the important known regulatory elements, including
those recognized by the tr (10,11), a more distant, zinc-sensitive element was a possibility. alternatively, the differential response of the
transiently transfected gh promoter could result from its lack of integration into the chromatin environment. with this approach, multiple
copies of the transiently transfected dna accumulate within the
nucleus in separate bodies, distinct from the endogenous dna and its
associated proteins. the amounts of dna taken up can disturb the stoichiometry with transcription factors, thus explaining why cotransfection of those factors is sometimes employed. its lack of incorporation
into chromatin results in failure to mimic any regulatory mechanism
dependent on that well-organized environment. stable transfections
were employed to investigate these possibilities. with this approach,
cotransfection of a neomycin-resistance gene allowed for selection of
only those cells taking up and incorporating the transgenes into chromosomal material so that they can be passed onto daughter cells. after
several generations of cell growth,  xxxg418xxx -resistent cells contained
luciferase activity and nontransfected cells were all killed, demonstrating the success of this approach. furthermore, luciferase activity in the
stably transfected cells was stimulated by treatment with t3 and that
stimulation was enhanced by dtpa, in a zinc-reversible manner. these
effects of dtpa were only seen in the presence of t3. thus, the stably
transfected gh promoter successfully mimicked endogenous gh
mrna expression in response to these stimuli.
the influence of the chromosomal environment and nuclear architecture on the processes of nuclear transcription are becoming increasingly
appreciated (20,21). the structure of the nucleus is highly organized and,
therefore, it is not surprising that the positioning of a transfected gene
within the nucleus is important for its regulation. differential responses of
transiently and stably transfected constructs have been reported previously (22–24). observing such a difference here suggests that either the
stoichiometry or the organization of the intact transcriptional environment
is not replicated with the transient transfections of the gh promoter and,
therefore, provides clues as to the steps affected by dtpa. it is relevant
here that cycloheximide was able to block the enhancement of gh gene
expression by dtpa. the interruption of protein synthesis presumably
alters the availability of a protein involved in the t3 transduction pathway,
within the chromatin environment. as the process of t3 regulation of gene
expression has become more precisely defined, the list of candidate proteins that might underlie these effects of dtpa is quite extensive. t3 action
within the nucleus depends not only on its receptor but also its hetbiological trace element research

erodimerization partner, the rxr (3), and a series of coregulatory proteins
that, in general, inhibit transcription in the absence of t3 (the corepressors)
or stimulate it in the presence of ligand (the coactivators) (25). these proteins are believed to work partially by a histone acetylase/deacetylase
mechanism, which would inevitably require a chromatin environment.
thus, alteration in zinc flux caused by dtpa might decrease the availability of a corepressor or increase the availability of a coactivator, thereby
enhancing the effectiveness of t3. these possibilities are now in the process
of being tested, by examining the effects of dtpa on the assembly of proteins on the gh promoter.
