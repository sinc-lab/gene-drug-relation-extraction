constitutive activity and inverse agonism at the m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor.  introduction of a single-point mutation (asn to tyr) at position 410 at the junction between transmembrane domain 6 and the third extracellular loop of the human m(2) muscarinic acetylcholine (mach) receptor generated a mutant receptor (n410y) that possesses many of the hallmark features of a constitutively active mutant receptor. these included enhanced agonist binding affinity and potency, in addition to agonist-independent accumulation of [(3)h]inositol phosphates in cells coexpressing the chimeric  xxxg2224xxx (qi5) protein and the n410y mutant m(2) mach receptor. constitutive activity was sensitive to inhibition by a range of muscarinic ligands, including those used clinically in the management of overactive bladder (oxybutynin,  xxxd3398xxx , and  xxxd1813xxx ), indicating that these ligands behave as inverse agonists at the m(2) mach receptor. long-term (24-h) treatment of chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the n410y mutant m(2) mach receptor with certain mach receptor inverse agonists (atropine,  xxxd1813xxx , and  xxxd2965xxx ) elicited a concentration-dependent up-regulation of cell surface receptor expression. however, not all ligands possessing negative efficacy in the [(3)h]inositol phosphate accumulation assays were capable of significantly up-regulating receptor expression, perhaps indicating a spectrum of negative efficacies among ligands traditionally defined as mach receptor antagonists. finally, structurally distinct agonists exhibited differences in their relative potencies for the activation of  xxxg2224xxx (i/o) versus  xxxg2224xxx (s), consistent with agonist-directed trafficking of signaling at the n410y mutant, but not at the wild-type m(2) mach receptor. this indicates that the n410y mutation of the m(2) mach receptor alters receptor-g-protein coupling in an agonist-dependent manner, in addition to generating a constitutively active receptor phenotype.
