abstract
 xxxd2369xxx  ( xxxd2369xxx ) is a wholly synthetic type i interferon (ifn), developed by scanning several
interferon-alpha nonallelic subtypes and assigning the most frequently observed amino acid in each position,
resulting in a consensus sequence. the antiviral, antiproliferative, nk cell activation activity, cytokine in¬
duction, and interferon-stimulated gene-induction activity of  xxxd2369xxx  has been compared with
naturally occurring type i interferons. in all of these comparisons,  xxxd2369xxx  had a higher activ¬
ity when compared, on a mass basis, with ifn-«2a and ifn-a2b, although the activity was the same for all
of these parameters on an antiviral unit basis. that a synthetic type i interferon could have higher activities
than naturally occurring molecules is surprising and may be a result of the higher affinity for the array of
type i interferon receptors demonstrated for  xxxd2369xxx  when compared with ifn- . in contrast,
 xxxd2369xxx  was shown to be an inferior inducer of il-lj3 when compared with ifn- . these results
may reflect differential binding to multiple accessory proteins interacting with a type i  xxxg1139xxx .
these unique biologic properties may lead to a favorable clinical benefit for  xxxd2369xxx  when com¬
pared with the naturally occurring recombinant molecules. ongoing clinical trials will ascertain whether con¬

introduction

type

i interferons (ifn) are a class of natural cytokines
that includes a family of greater than 25 ifn-a(1) as well
as ifn-ß, and ifn- . although evolutionarily derived from the
same gene,(2) there are many differences in the primary se¬
quence of these molecules, implying an evolutionary divergence
in biologic activity. because the only type i ifn analyzed by
three-dimensional structural analysis has been ifn-/3,<3) it is im¬
possible to explore the structural relationships between the dif¬
ferent type i ifn at this level. all type i ifn share a common
pattern of biologic effects that begin with binding of the ifn
to the cell surface receptor/4' binding is followed by activation
of tyrosine kinases, including the janus tyrosine kinases and the
stat proteins, which leads to the production of several ifnstimulated gene products/5' the ifn-stimulated gene products
are responsible for the pleotropic biologic effects of type i ifn,
including antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory

effects, cytokine induction, and hla class i and class ii regulation.<6> examples of ifn-stimulated gene products include 25-oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5 oas), /^-microglobulin,
neopterin, p68 kinases, and the mx protein.<7_9) although all
type 1 ifn have similar biologic effects, not all the activities
are shared by each type i ifn; and, in many cases, the extent

of activity varies quite substantially for each ifn subtype.(10,11)
more specifically, investigations into the properties of differ¬
ent subtypes of ifn- and molecular hybrids of ifn- have
shown differences in pharmacologie properties.'xt> these phar¬
macologie differences may arise from as few as three amino
acid residue changes.(13)
eighty-five to 166 amino acids are conserved in the known
ifn- subtypes. excluding the ifn-a pseudogenes, there are
approximately 25 known distinct ifn- subtypes. pairwise
comparisons of these nonallelic subtypes show primary se¬
quence differences ranging from 2% to 23%. table 1 presents

the biologic activity of type i ifn has been shown to be
species specific. to identify species that would be useful in preclinical toxicology testing for consensus ifn, hu et al."9) tested
the antiviral activity of consensus ifn on cell lines derived from
species typically used in preclinical studies, including primate,
rabbit, mouse, rat, cat, dog, hamster, and guinea pig (table 2).

of other ifn- subtypes."' the natural ifn- subtypes can be
classified into two major groups, group i and group ii, accord¬
ing to the distribution of seven amino acids at positions 14, 16,
71, 78, 79, 83, and 160.14 three of the ifn- subtypes, ifnah, ifn-af, and ifn-ab, appear to be hybrids between group
i and group ii.

 xxxd2369xxx 

synthesis
in 1981, researchers at amgen inc. (thousand oaks, ca)
constructed a synthetic nonnaturally occurring type i ifn de¬
rived by scanning the sequences of several natural ifn- sub¬
types and assigning the most frequently observed amino acid
in each corresponding position.'14) the synthetic dna-coding
sequences were ligated into an escherichia coli expression vec¬
tor, and the novel molecule was produced by bacterial cell fer¬
mentation. this molecule, called  xxxd2369xxx 
( xxxd2369xxx ), contains 166 amino acid residues (table 1). when
compared with ifn-a2, the ifn subtype most commonly used
in clinical applications, consensus ifn has 20 amino acid dif¬
ferences. additionally, consensus ifn has approximately 30%
sequence identity with ifn-/3, a greater similarity than any of
the natural ifn- subtypes, as well as approximately 60% se¬
quence identity with ifn- .

physical characterization
when recombinant proteins are expressed in e. coli, amino
terminal processing variants may occur.<15'16) analysis of con¬
sensus ifn by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page)
results in a single band with a molecular weight (mw) of 19,600
daltons. however, three isoelectric subforms are observed us¬
ing analytic isoelectric focusing (fig. 1 ) and ion exchange highpressure liquid chromatography (hplc) (fig. 2). these were
confirmed to be methionyl consensus ifn, des-methionyl con¬
sensus ifn, and na-acylated des-methionyl consensus ifn.'17)
and had the same pharmacokinetic behavior when administered
to hamsters (j. young, amgen inc., personal communication).
circular dichroism analysis of the three subforms indicated no

the host range of consensus ifn was found to be similar to
that of ifn-a2b.(19) initial experiments using 100 and 1000 u
of consensus ifn in antiviral protection assays indicated that
most nonhuman cell lines were not protected against vesicular
stomatitis virus (vsv). in general, primate cells were well pro¬
tected, only slightly less than cells derived from human tissue.
cells derived from hamster and guinea pig tissues were par¬
tially protected. the use of the syrian golden hamster for pre¬
clinical testing of consensus ifn has been reported previously
in experiments demonstrating in vivo antiviral activity.'20' in
contrast, there was virtually no protection by consensus ifn of
dog, rat, mouse, rabbit, or cat cell lines.

antibody

studies

-type i ifn can be classified according to their reactivity
with neutralizing antibodies. in general, antibodies that neu¬
tralize ifn- tend not to neutralize ifn-/3 and ifn- . similarly,
antibodies that neutralize ifn-/3 do not neutralize ifn- or
ifn- . poly clonai antibodies produced against leukocyte ifn
do cross-react with ifn-conl, although both polyclonal and
monoclonal antibodies raised against ifn-conl cross-react
poorly with other types of ifn-a.
a neutralizing antibody (4f2) was raised against consensus
ifn using immunized balb/c mouse splenocytes and sp20
myeloma cells. epitope mapping studies with this monoclonal
antibody, using fragments of the protein, indicated that the an¬
tibody interacted between the third and fourth methionine
residues of consensus ifn, including the cysteine at position
139, known to be important in the active conformation of ifna.'21) this antibody was also able to neutralize ifn-a2 and ifnal. however, the effect on ifn-a2 was approximately 50% of
that of consensus ifn. these results are consistent with the ob¬
servation that these interferons share common amino acids
within the 4f2-defined epitope, including amino acids 113 to
139(10)

characterization of in vitro biologic activity

comparisons of the biologic activity of consensus ifn with
biologic activity of natural type i ifn have shown inter¬
esting results. for example, the specific activity of consensus
ifn, defined as antiviral units per milligram of protein, has been
consistently reported to be 5-fold to 20-fold higher than that of
other ifn- . in other studies,'14,19' consensus ifn had a spe¬
cific activity of 2 x 109u/mg protein compared with other ifna, which ranged between 1 and 4 x 108 u/mg protein. this
high specific activity has been confirmed in a number of labo¬
ratories using both dna and rna viruses on hela, wish,
and hep-2 cells.'10·11·19'
the

human alpha species consensus ifn
in addition to antiviral effects, the antiproliferative effect of
ifn was compared with that of several ifn- sub¬

consensus

well as with ifn-/3"0·11' on a human burkitt's lym¬
cell
line (daudi cells) and a hairy cell leukemia-like cell
phoma
line (eskol).'22' in all cases using equimolar concentrations of
either consensus ifn, ifn- , or ifn-/3, the extent of inhibition
was greater with consensus ifn that with the other type i in¬
terferons. conversion of the comparisons made on a mass ba¬
sis to a unit basis using the respective specific activities of each
ifn revealed a similar antiproliferative effect for each ifn.
studies examining the nk cell activation effects of type 1
ifn also have demonstrated"higher activity for consensus ifn,
which was found to be a more potent inducer of nk cell cytopathic effect against a cell line derived from a patient with
chronic myelogenous leukemia (k562) on a mass basis than
natural buffy coat-derived ifn- .'14' similar to the effect found
for antiproliferative activity, conversion of the comparisons
made on a mass basis to an antiviral unit basis using the re¬
spective specific activities of each ifn revealed a similar nk
cell activation effect for each ifn, although five times less con¬
sensus ifn was used in the experiment.'14' these findings have
been confirmed by more recent studies comparing the activa¬
tion of nk cells with ifn-a2a and ifn-a2b with consensus
ifn using eskol and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(aids)-related kaposi's sarcoma (ks) cells as targets.'11·23'
besides stimulation of nk cells, type i ifn are known to
profoundly stimulate the production of cytokines. more specif¬
ically, type i ifn have been shown to stimulate the production
of interleukin (il)-iß and il-ira, an  xxxd2806xxx ,
thus possibly affecting the inflammatory response.'24' studies
comparing the cytokine-induction activities of consensus ifn
and ifn-a2b on a molar basis demonstrated that, unlike results
seen with antiviral, antiproliferative, and nk cell activation,
similar amounts of il-1/3 were induced by both ifn-a2a and
consensus ifn following treatment of human blood over a
24-48-h period.'25' however, at high concentrations, both ifn
inhibited il-1 ß induction. on an antiviral unit basis, consen¬
sus ifn shows a 5-fold lower il-1 ß-inducing activity compared
with ifn-a2a. in contrast, there was a 3-fold to 4-fold higher
induction of  xxxd2806xxx  per milligram of consen¬
sus ifn than with ifn-a2a.<25'
fish et al. (10) have attempted to define the amino acid
residues that are important for receptor interaction and activa¬
tion of the antiviral response for both consensus ifn and ifna. studies with consensus ifn implicate the region adjacent to
amino acids 78 and 79 as important in the antiviral response.
it should be emphasized that there is a direct correlation among
the antiviral response, antiproliferative response, and nk-activating activity of this ifn.

types

as

molecular basis for enhanced

biologic activity

the biologic specific activity of ifn, measured as a partic¬
ular biologic response to a given mass quantity of cytokine, can
be attributed to two mechanisms. activity is directly related to
receptor binding and possibly related to the degree of binding
or internalization or both. in addition, ifn bind to complex re¬
ceptors with multiple accessory proteins interacting with a pri¬
mary receptor. this may allow differential activation of primary
signals or alter the extent of binding.

in a quantitative comparison of the induction of specific
mrna sequences encoding protein products induced by ifn
(irf-1,  xxxg688xxx , and  xxxg1056xxx ) in three different cell lines
(daudi, eskol, and mei80), consensus ifn induced peak
mrna levels  xxxd1891xxx -fold lower concentrations than did ifn-a2.
no difference in the kinetics of induction was noted when cells
were treated with equal units of either consensus ifn or ifna2. these measurements were made over a 5-log concentration
range at increasing times after treatment.'26' it should be noted
that these are late-responsive genes that may be secondarily in¬
duced by ifn-stimulated genes (isg) that were induced as a
direct result of the kinase cascade. in addition, no significant
difference between the two type i ifn treatments was found in
internalization kinetics'27' or  xxxg1219xxx ,  xxxg2364xxx , or stat protein
phosphorylation levels (s.b. klein, unpublished observations).
direct ligand-binding studies performed in a number of lab¬
oratories'27-39' indicate specific binding between the type i ifn
molecule and a high-affinity receptor site. recent evidence in¬
dicates that there are multiple proteins that form the receptor
complex,'29·40-44' and scatchard analysis of ifn- and ifn-/3
binding to the cell surface produces biphasic curves indicating
more than one binding site.'27·30·31·36·39·45-50' domanski et
al.'43' reported that the expression of either the 55 kda ßs or
the 100 kda ß subunit of the human type i ifn receptor in
mouse l-929 cells produced low-affinity binding of human type
i ifn. coincident expression of the subunit produced both
low-affinity and high-affinity binding, but expression of the
subunit alone produced no measurable binding. similar exper¬
iments conducted in a human fibroblast cell background indi¬
cated that a third component encoded on chromosome 21 was
also required to produce both binding and biologic activity.'44'
korn et al.'51' reported that a hypervariable amino acid sequence
within the ifn- molecules appears to be involved in secondary
binding and is implicated in species specificity. it is possible
that by binding to this site, the accessory proteins participate in
species-specific ifn binding. because consensus ifn contains
an average of all the hypervariable amino acids, it may be that
this ifn binds with greater affinity to these sites or binds to a
larger number of these sites or their combinations. this inter¬
pretation is supported by the results obtained when three type
i ifn, ifn-a2, ifn-j3ser, and consensus ifn, competed for
binding to caki cells (pfeffer et al., unpublished observations).
consensus ifn competed equally well with radiolabeled ifna2 for cell surface binding sites. ifn-ßser competed poorly for
the ifn-a2-occupied sites. on the other hand, ifn-/3ser and
ifn-a2 competed equally for the radiolabeled consensus ifn
bound sites. this may indicate that the consensus binding site
includes elements required by ifn-/3ser. in all reports, consen¬
sus ifn bound to the cell surface in larger numbers'27' (l.m.
pfeffer, personal communication) and with greater affin¬
ity'10·27·35' (l.m. pfeffer, unpublished observations) than all
other type i ifn examined. these binding differences may help
to explain the observed biologic and clinical differences among
the natural type i ifn and consensus ifn.
klein et al.'27' quantified the dissociation constants (kd) de¬
rived from deconvolution of the biphasic scatchard plot into
two components. the k¿ for consensus ifn was calculated to
be approximately 0.4 x 10~n m, whereas the k¿ for ifn-a2
has been evaluated at 1.07 x 10"11 m'27·31' and 2-5.2 x 10"11
when measured at 15°c.'34) the difference in kd and differ-

in number of occupied receptors may be sufficient to ac¬
for the 10-fold higher specific activity.
structure/function studies suggest that no single region of
the type i ifn molecule is involved in binding, but rather two
distinct domains are involved.'51' these are amino acids 29 to
35 and 123 to 166. a computer-generated, three-dimensional,
atomic-level model for consensus ifn was produced by using
the known x-ray crystallographic structure of murine ifn-ß as
a guide.'3' alignment was achieved by matching side chain
identities and side chain hydropathies between consensus ifn
and ifn-/3. the two domains, 29 to 35 and 123 to 140, are pre¬
dicted to be in proximity in the model and may constitute a
high-affinity receptor-recognition domain, whereas residues 78
to 95 are somewhat removed from this area and are proposed
to constitute a subtype-specific binding site.
the computer model for the three-dimensional structure of
consensus ifn is supported by epitope mapping of various type
i ifn. for example, the amino acids 5, 10, and 11 are adjacent
and 5 and 11 are exposed to the surface of the theoretical con¬
sensus ifn structure. these amino acids are proposed to be rec¬
ognized by the antibody ul.'52·53' an antibody against residue
34, which is within the proposed receptor binding region of the
consensus ifn, blocked ifn activity, indicating both accessi¬
bility and functionality.'52·53' antibodies against amino acids
113-149"°' and 30-40,'54' regions designated by korn et al.'51'
as high-affinity receptor-binding sites, block antiviral activity.
in addition, antibody binding to the last 10 to 16 amino acids
(150-166) indicates that this region is exposed but is not in¬
volved in receptor binding.'55' a synthetic peptide composed
of amino acids 124-138 was shown to possess antiviral activ¬
ity,'56' confirming both binding and functionality of this region

produced by allosteric binding to the receptor molecule, en¬
hancement could also be explained by the binding of this pep¬
tide to an auxiliary receptor protein. in vitro mutagenesis indi¬
cated that the activity of ifn-a2 was particularly dependent on
all three of the regions identified in the theoretical three-di¬
mensional model. mutations to arginine at positions 33,'58·59'

since human type i ifn do not have any effect on mice, most
studies with these molecules have been performed with human
tumors (xenografts) in nude mice, and this has proved to be a
useful model. balkwill et al.'61' tested the effect of six differ¬
ent type i ifn on breast cancer xenograft (t1068) and bowel
cancer xenograft (ef3) cells. of the six type i ifn tested, ifnaa, ifn-a namalwa, and consensus ifn had the highest an¬
tiproliferative activity in vivo. with consensus ifn, 10-fold less
protein was used to achieve the same results as found with the
naturally occurring ifn. it is of interest that neither ifn-/3,
ifn- , nor ifn-ad had an effect on these tumors. none of the
ifn tested, including consensus ifn, had any significant effect
on ef3 cells.

applied beginning 4 h after virus inoculation, there was a de¬
crease in the severity of the infection. the results further
demonstrated that on a per unit basis, consensus ifn was more
potent than ifn- . one interesting observation was that at doses
of ifn-a2 > 5 x 106 u, there was no additional effect, but that
high doses of consensus ifn provided complete protection
against infection.

treatment of experimental tumors
with the  xxxd2369xxx  gene
three eukaryotic expression vectors containing the 0.6 kb
dna insert, including a signal sequence and coding sequences
of consensus ifn, were constructed in which the consensus ifn
gene was driven by either the metal-inducible mouse metallothionein-1 (mmt-1) promoter or one of two constitutive vi¬
ral promoters, the cytomegalovirus (cmv) or the rous sarcoma
virus (rsv) ltr. when k562 cells derived from a myelogenous leukemia line were transfected with the plasmid constructs
containing the consensus ifn gene, there was a change in the
oncogenic phenotype of the tumor cells.'63' such cells lost their

oncogenic potential and no longer formed tumors in nude mice,
although control cells and cells transformed with the bacterial
neomycin gene developed into palpable tumors within 1 week.
a number of characteristics of the transformed cells were
changed, including a decrease in growth rate and an increase
in the number of cells undergoing terminal differentiation, en¬
tering s phase in the cell cycle, and undergoing apoptosis. there
was also an increase in major histocompatibility (mhc) ii sur¬
face markers, similar to that found after treatment with exoge¬
nous consensus ifn or ifn- . high levels of consensus ifn
were secreted by cells transfected with either pcmv-ifn-conl
or prsv-ifn-conl (3-16 x 105 u/106 cells/24 h), whereas
low levels of secretion were found in cells transfected with
pmmt-ifn-conl (20-256 u/106 cells/24 h). the antiviral ac¬
tivity detected in consensus ifn-transfected cells was blocked
by a monoclonal anticonsensus ifn antibody, verifying that the
assay was a measure of consensus ifn activity.
similar results were found following cloning of the consen¬
sus ifn gene into the adeno-associated viral (aav) vector and
infection of a series of tumor cells.'64' hela, 293, eskol, and
k562 cells were all infected with aav constructs containing
the consensus ifn gene linked to the mmt-1 promoter. in all
cases, except hela, there was complete abolishment of the abil¬
ity of such cells to form tumors in nude mice. in the case of
hela, the transfected tumor cells grow considerably slower
than nontransfected cells. thus, the integration of the consen¬
sus gene resulted in lessening of the oncogenic potential. this

human alpha species consensus ifn
work indicates that the gene might be useful in the application
of direct gene therapy of specific cancers. it should be noted
that growth of all of these tumors was inhibited even though
the gene was producing very low amounts of consensus ifn.

discussion

although consensus ifn is a nonnaturally occurring syn¬
thetic molecule, it has potent biologic activity that in many cases
is higher than that of naturalfy occurring type i ifn. that a syn¬
thetic type i ifn could have higher activities than naturally oc¬
curring molecules is surprising and may be a result of the higher
affinity for the array of type i ifn receptors demonstrated for
consensus ifn when compared with ifn- . this high binding
affinity may reflect increased binding capacity or signaling at
lower protein concentrations, or both. in addition, it was highly
unexpected to find that although consensus ifn has higher bi¬
ologic effects when compared with equal mass concentrations
of naturally occurring type i ifn on antiviral activity, antipro¬
liferative activity, nk-cell activation, and induction of il-lra,
it has a similar effect in the induction of inflammatory cy¬
tokines, such as il-1/3. this may reflect differential binding to
multiple accessory proteins interacting with a common type i
ifn receptor.
the high specific activity of consensus ifn may make this
molecule a more efficient protein for clinical applications than
naturally occurring type 1 ifn, since the higher activity allows
for the administration of lower amounts of protein with high
potency. ongoing clinical trials in the treatment of chronic vi¬
ral infections and certain malignancies will ascertain if any of
these in vitro characterized advantages of consensus ifn lead
to real clinical benefits.
