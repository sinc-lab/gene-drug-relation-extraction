abstract
breast cancer is the most common carcinoma diagnosed in women today excluding non-melanoma
skin cancers. it has been well documented that estrogen plays a critical role in its development and
is a major target for treatment. for many years, tamoxifen has been the gold standard for adjuvant
hormonal therapy in breast cancer patients. with newer products targeting different mechanisms to
suppress estrogen production, patients now have many decisions regarding their care. agents such
as luteinizing hormone releasing hormone ( xxxg930xxx ) agonists can suppress ovarian function in
premenopausal patients and have been shown to be as effective and even better than
chemotherapy (cmf — cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil-containing regimens) in
certain patient populations. tamoxifen continues to be an option as well as  xxxd3402xxx , a similar
selective  xxxg730xxx  modulator. with the advent of newer third generation aromatase
inhibitors (anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane) toxicities have been documented to be less and
in some cases they are more efficacious than the standard, tamoxifen. this article reviews the
current data regarding ovarian suppression, ovarian suppression plus tamoxifen, tamoxifen,
 xxxd3402xxx , anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane in the treatment of adjuvant hormonalsensitive breast cancer.

introduction
breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in
women today excluding non-melanoma skin cancers. due
to increased awareness and numerous screening programs, more and more patients are being diagnosed with
earlier, more treatable cancers (weir et al. 2003). in
addition, advances in the multidisciplinary approach to
treatment (chemo/hormonal therapy, surgery and radiation) have enabled practitioners to treat patients better
and to improve outcomes. hormonal therapy plays an
important role in breast cancer and estrogen speciﬁcally is
targeted in many of the treatments prescribed. it is well
established that estrogen plays a critical role in breast
cancer. beatson (1896) discovered this over 100 years ago
when he demonstrated a response in a premenopausal
woman with breast cancer after an oophorectomy. it was
not until approximately 60 years later that estrogen (or
the lack of it) was found to be responsible for this clinical
effect (jordan 1999).

the gold standard for the past two decades has been
the use of tamoxifen in hormone-sensitive patients
( xxxg730xxx  (er) positive and/or progesterone
receptor (pr) positive). over the course of 20 years,
tamoxifen’s indications have broadened from the treatment of metastatic disease to the treatment of early stage
breast cancer to even the prevention of disease in high-risk
women. although it is a very effective treatment,
tamoxifen does have known side effects such as endometrial cancer, thromboembolic events, and uterine
sarcoma (jaiyesimi et al. 1995, fisher et al. 1996,
wickerham et al. 2002). newer agents are now available
for this patient population.  xxxd3402xxx , an analog of
tamoxifen, was created under the premise of ﬁnding an
agent with similar efﬁcacy to tamoxifen but with fewer
side effects (tomas et al. 1995, wiseman & goa 1997,
marttunen et al. 1998). aromatase inhibitors (ais) and
other modalities such as ovarian suppression with
luteinizing hormone releasing factor ( xxxg930xxx ) agonists

jones and buzdar: adjuvant hormonal therapy
offer different mechanisms to suppress estrogen production and action and these agents have better safety proﬁles
compared with tamoxifen. this article will review each of
these hormonal therapies (ovarian suppression, tamoxifen,  xxxd3402xxx , and aromatase inhibitors) in the treatment of hormone-sensitive early breast cancer.

ovarian ablation as adjuvant therapy
ovarian ablation, through surgical oophorectomy or
ovarian irradiation, is an effective treatment for premenopausal women with early breast cancer. in a metaanalysis conducted by the early breast cancer trialists’
collaborative group (ebctcg) (1998) women <50
years of age had a signiﬁcant survival advantage in
terms of both disease-free survival (dfs) and overall
survival (os) with ovarian ablation compared with
women receiving no adjuvant treatment. these results
were comparable with those found in a similar analysis of
patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy (ebctcg
1996). the major disadvantage of oophorectomy or
ovarian irradiation for premenopausal patients is the
morbidity and mortality associated with these procedures
and their irreversibility. therefore, the  xxxg930xxx  agonists,
which produce a medical ovarian ablation, have been
developed for the treatment of breast cancer in premenopausal women avoiding the complications associated with
surgery and radiation. this therapy allows some patients
to maintain their ovarian function after completion of
 xxxg930xxx  agonist adjuvant therapy. the most extensively
studied  xxxg930xxx  agonist in both the advanced and early
breast cancer setting is  xxxd2229xxx  acetate (zoladex), a
decapeptide analog of  xxxg930xxx . other  xxxg930xxx  agonists
(leuprolide (lupron) and  xxxd3445xxx  (trilstar)) are available in the usa and are currently undergoing trials in
many disease states including breast cancer. seven phase
iii trials have been conducted and are described below.

 xxxg930xxx  agonists in early breast cancer (see
table 1 for summary of trials)

 xxxd2229xxx  as an alternative to chemotherapy
zebra trial
to date, the zebra (zoladex early breast cancer
research association) trial is the largest adjuvant trial
investigating the effect of  xxxd2229xxx  in pre/perimenopausal
women with early breast cancer ðn ¼ 1640þ (jonat et al.
2002). in this study, patients were 50 years of age, with
node-positive, stage ii breast cancer who had received no
previous systemic treatment. after patients had completed
their local therapy (surgery and/or radiotherapy), patients
were randomized to receive either  xxxd2229xxx  (3.6 mg s.c.
every 28 days for 2 years) or cmf (6 cycles) consisting of

392

cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2 i.v. on days 1 and 8 or
100 mg/m2 orally on days 1–14), methotrexate (40 mg/m2
i.v. on days 1 and 8) and 5-ﬂuorouracil (600 mg/m2 i.v. on
days 1 and 8).  xxxg1603xxx  status was not required
for entry into the study, but it was left to each center’s
discretion to enter er-positive patients. primary endpoints
were dfs and os. a planned subset analysis of er status
and age was conducted. return of menstrual function was
also assessed. in the ﬁrst analysis with a median follow-up
of 6 years, patient characteristics were well balanced
between the groups. in the overall population, dfs was
signiﬁcantly better for cmf compared with  xxxd2229xxx 
(hazard ratio (hr) = 1.18, 95% conﬁdence interval
(ci) = 1.02–1.37, p ¼ 0:029) unlike os (hr = 1.21,
95% ci = 0.99–1.49, p ¼ 0:067). when looking only at
those patients with er-positive disease, the results were
different. in er-positive patients only, dfs was demonstrated to be similar with cmf and with  xxxd2229xxx 
(hr = 1.01, 95% ci = 0.84–1.20, p ¼ 0:94) while in ernegative patients  xxxd2229xxx  was inferior to cmf (hr =
1.76, 95% ci = 1.27–2.44, p ¼ 0:0006). overall survival
was similar for cmf and for  xxxd2229xxx  in the er-positive
group (hr = 0.99, 95% ci = 0.76–1.28, p ¼ 0:92); however, er-negative patients did signiﬁcantly better with
cmf (hr = 1.77, 95% ci = 1.19–2.63, p ¼ 0:0043)
(jonat et al. 2002).
updated analyses of the efﬁcacy data were conducted
after a median follow-up of 7.3 years and the ﬁndings
were very similar (kaufmann et al. 2003). in the overall
population, dfs was signiﬁcantly better for the cmf
arm compared with the  xxxd2229xxx  arm ðp ¼ 0:007þ. in the
er-positive patients, dfs was no better with  xxxd2229xxx 
compared with cmf ðp ¼ 0:597þ while for er-negative
patients, dfs demonstrated that  xxxd2229xxx  was inferior to
cmf ðp ¼ 0:0001þ. at the time of the updated analysis,
28% of patients had died. overall survival for the entire
population illustrated no difference with  xxxd2229xxx  treatment compared with cmf ðp ¼ 0:137þ. er-positive
patients showed non-inferiority of  xxxd2229xxx  vs cmf
ðp ¼ 0:622þ while er-negative patients continued to
demonstrate signiﬁcantly better os with cmf compared
with  xxxd2229xxx  ðp ¼ 0:009þ thus conﬁrming the lack of
efﬁcacy of hormonal treatment for such tumors.
amenorrhea occurred more rapidly in the  xxxd2229xxx 
group compared with the cmf arm (jonat et al. 2002). at
24 weeks, 95% of patients in the  xxxd2229xxx  group had
amenorrhea compared with only 59% in the cmf group.
three years after treatment, menses had returned in the
majority of women randomized to  xxxd2229xxx  (compared
with the only 23% who remained amenorrheic). seventyseven percent of patients treated with cmf maintained
amenorrhea, suggesting a permanent ovarian ablation.
return of menses did not impact recurrence rate or os in

endocrine-related cancer (2004) 11 391–406
this patient population. this information was based on a
subset analysis not originally planned at the beginning of
the trial and the authors concluded that this should only
be thought of as ‘exploratory’ data (jonat et al. 2002).
side effects in the cmf group were as expected for
chemotherapy (see table 2) and included alopecia,
nausea/vomiting and infections. menopausal symptoms
such as vaginal dryness and hot ﬂushes were more
prevalent with  xxxd2229xxx  compared with cmf. after
cessation of treatment, the side effects continued in the
cmf group, but were reduced in the  xxxd2229xxx  group
correlating with the reversible nature of the type of
ovarian ablation (jonat et al. 2002). the side effect proﬁle
remained the same across both the original results and the
updated analysis (kaufmann et al. 2003). this trial
established  xxxd2229xxx  as an effective alternative for the
treatment of early breast cancer in premenopausal, nodepositive and er-positive patients.

 xxxd2229xxx  plus tamoxifen as an alternative to
chemotherapy
abcsg trial
the austrian breast cancer study group (abcsg) 05
trial was set up in 1990 to compare dfs and os among
premenopausal women with  xxxg1603xxx -positive or
-negative, node-positive or -negative early breast cancer
(jakesz et al. 2002). patients received cmf6 cycles
(cyclophosphamide 100 mg/m2 orally on days 1–14,
methotrexate 40 mg/m2 i.v. and 5-ﬂuorouracil 600 mg/m2
i.v. on days 1 and 8) every 28 days or  xxxd2229xxx  (3.6 mg sq
every 28 days) for 3 years plus tamoxifen (20 mg orally
daily) for 5 years. at a median follow-up of 5 years, only
9% of patients have died from breast cancer, and survival
differences between the two treatments were not signiﬁcant ðp ¼ 0:19þ. nineteen percent of women developed
recurrence regardless of hormonal status; however there
were signiﬁcant differences in favor of the group receiving

tamoxifen plus  xxxg930xxx  agonists compared with the
chemotherapy arm ðp ¼ 0:037þ. recurrence-free survival
at 5 years in the  xxxg1603xxx -positive subgroup
demonstrated that  xxxd2229xxx  plus tamoxifen was signiﬁcantly better than cmf ðp ¼ 0:037þ. in addition, local
recurrence-free survival also favored  xxxd2229xxx  plus
tamoxifen in the  xxxg1603xxx -positive population
ðp ¼ 0:015þ. overall survival was not signiﬁcantly different between the endocrine arm and the chemotherapy
group ðp ¼ 0:195þ. further follow-up is warranted due to
the small number of events that have occurred. hot
ﬂushes were the most common side effect reported in the
 xxxd2229xxx  plus tamoxifen group, but there were more
reports of hot ﬂushes, nausea and alopecia in the
chemotherapy group compared with the combination
arm (jakesz et al. 2002). the authors concluded that
 xxxd2229xxx  plus tamoxifen is more effective and better
tolerated than cmf as adjuvant therapy in premenopausal women with hormone-sensitive breast cancer.

grocta 02 trial
grocta 02 (italian breast cancer adjuvant chemohormone therapy cooperative group trial) is a
randomized, multicenter trial comparing chemotherapy
(cmf) with ovarian suppression (either  xxxd2229xxx  (3.6 mg
sq every 28 days for 2 years) or ovarian irradiation) plus
tamoxifen (20 mg p.o. daily) in premenopausal women for
5 years (boccardo et al. 2000). a total of 120 patients were
randomized to cmf and 124 patients were randomized to
 xxxd2229xxx  plus tamoxifen. during the median follow-up of
6.3 years, 37% of patients relapsed and 18% of patients
died. there were no signiﬁcant differences in dfs or os
comparing the chemotherapy and endocrine groups
(dfs, p ¼ 0:8; os, p ¼ 0:3). a separate analysis of
patients who received endocrine therapy ðn ¼ 119þ
showed that there was no difference in clinical outcome
between patients receiving ovarian irradiation ðn ¼ 31þ or
 xxxd2229xxx  ðn ¼ 82þ (38% vs 33% relapsed respectively). six
patients had their ovaries removed. myelosuppression,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and alopecia were more
common in the cmf group compared with the ovarian

394

ablation plus tamoxifen group while spotting and hot
ﬂushes were more common among patients with ovarian
ablation plus tamoxifen compared with cmf (boccardo
et al. 2000). this trial demonstrated that the combination
of hormonal therapy plus ovarian suppression was safe
and effective in er-positive patients with early breast
cancer.

ovarian suppression in women who maintained
ovarian function after chemotherapy
zipp trial
the zipp (zoladex in premenopausal patients) analysis
involved a combination of data from randomized trials
initiated by four international collaborative groups
(cancer research campaign breast cancer trials
group, stockholm breast cancer study group, south
east sweden breast cancer group, and gruppo interdisciplinaire valutazione interventi in oncologia). these
trials ran concurrently with similar protocols. each center
could determine initial treatment (surgery/radiation/chemotherapy) and whether to randomize patients to
tamoxifen therapy. premenopausal patients received
primary surgery and standard therapy, which could
include chemotherapy (most commonly cmf) and/or
radiotherapy. this was followed by randomization to one
of four groups:  xxxd2229xxx  (3.6 mg sq every 28 days, for 2
years), tamoxifen (20 mg p.o. daily for 2 years),  xxxd2229xxx 
(3.6 mg sq every 28 days, for 2 years) plus tamoxifen
(20 mg p.o. daily for 2 years), or no further endocrine
therapy. results to date have only been published in
abstract form. with a median follow-up of 4.3 years,
initial results showed that patients who received  xxxd2229xxx 
in addition to standard chemotherapy compared with no
 xxxd2229xxx  had a signiﬁcant decrease in the risk of
recurrence (20% vs 25% respectively, p < 0:001) (rutqvist 1999). a beneﬁt in os was not demonstrated to be
statistically signiﬁcant (11% vs 12% respectively,
p ¼ 0:12). the beneﬁt of  xxxd2229xxx  was observed irrespective of the use of chemotherapy or tamoxifen treatment. a
5-year update was presented at the meeting of the
american society of clinical oncology (asco) in 2000

 xxxd2229xxx -containing group ðp ¼ 0:08þ (houghton et al.
2000). neither abstract documented toxicities or menopausal status changes with regard to treatment received.
in this setting, ovarian ablation demonstrated added
beneﬁt compared with the other treatment arms. in this
study the role of tamoxifen was not adequately addressed.

int-0101
int-0101 was designed to investigate the effect of
adjuvant chemohormonal therapy in patients with  xxxg1603xxx -positive (estrogen and/or progesterone
receptor-positive), node-positive breast tumors (davidson
et al. 1999a,b). patients were randomized to chemotherapy (caf — cyclophosphamide 100 mg/m2, orally  14
days, doxorubicin 30 mg/m2 i.v. on days 1 and 8, and 5ﬂuorouracil 500 mg/m2 i.v. on days 1 and 8, for six 28-day
cycles), chemotherapy plus  xxxd2229xxx  (3.6 mg sq every 28
days for 5 years), or chemotherapy plus  xxxd2229xxx  (3.6 mg
sq every 28 days for 5 years) plus tamoxifen (20 mg p.o.
daily for 5 years). after 6 years of median follow-up,
results showed signiﬁcant beneﬁt in 5-year dfs only for
the triplet arm compared with the other groups. patients
treated with chemotherapy plus  xxxd2229xxx  had similar dfs
compared with patients receiving chemotherapy alone,
thus the value of  xxxd2229xxx  alone in this study remains
unclear (see table 3). overall survival was similar among
all three groups (see table 3). in patients <40 years of
age, the relative beneﬁt in dfs with triplet therapy was
particularly marked (72% vs 65% with chemotherapy
plus  xxxd2229xxx  vs 54% with chemotherapy alone),
although this may be due, in part, to the fact that a
high fraction of this subset of women maintained ovarian
function in spite of chemotherapy (see table 3) (davidson
et al. 1999a,b, kuter 1999). no mention of patients who
maintained or lost ovarian function was documented. the
int-0101 trial, which was designed on the basis of the
results of the early overview analysis of the ebctcg

showed a beneﬁt for the triplet arm over the chemotherapy alone and chemotherapy plus ovarian ablation.
davidson and colleagues (2003) presented a 9-year
updated analysis at asco in 2003. the combination arm
of caf +  xxxd2229xxx  + tamoxifen continued to demonstrate statistically signiﬁcant reductions in recurrences
(hr = 0.73, p < 0:01). the chemotherapy+ xxxd2229xxx 
arm, however, no longer illustrated such beneﬁt (hr =
0.93, p ¼ 0:25). overall survival was not signiﬁcant in
either arm. exploratory retrospective subset analyses were
conducted and illustrated a trend of beneﬁt in the
following women: those who were <40 years of age,
premenopausal, those with trends in estradiol levels, and
those women who become amenorrheic after caf. these
results were exploratory and continued analysis will
identify any beneﬁt based on age, hormone levels, and
menopausal status. one limitation of the study was that a
chemotherapy + tamoxifen alone arm was not included
(which would be considered standard of care) (davidson
et al. 2003).

ibcsg trial
the ibcsg (international breast cancer study group)
viii trial randomized 1063 premenopausal women with
node-negative,  xxxg1603xxx -positive or -negative
breast cancer to one of four treatment arms (castiglionegertsch et al. 2002). following surgery, patients were
randomized to chemotherapy (cmf 6 cycles),  xxxd2229xxx 
alone (3.6 6 cycles plus  xxxd2229xxx  (3.6 mg sq every 28
days for 18 months), or no adjuvant systemic treatment.
during the course of this trial, the control arm (no
treatment) was dropped due to results from other ongoing
trials. results have recently been published with a median
follow-up of 7 years (castiglione-gertsch et al. 2003). no
difference among the three treatment arms was observed
for dfs. five-year dfs for cmf  6 was 82% (95%
ci = 78–86%), while dfs for cmf  6 followed by
 xxxd2229xxx  for 18 months was 87% (95% ci = 83–91%)
and for  xxxd2229xxx  alone it was 79% (95% ci = 75–84%).

jones and buzdar: adjuvant hormonal therapy
no p values were reported based on individual treatment
arms; however, the cis did overlap. p values were
reported in the data, but only when comparing combination arms. in patients with er-positive disease, cmf  6
or  xxxd2229xxx  were equivalent in terms of 5-year dfs (81%,
95% ci = 76–87%; 81%, 95% ci = 76–87% respectively). with the sequential administration of cmf
followed by  xxxd2229xxx , 5-year dfs was 86% with a 95%
ci of 82–91%. once again no individual p values were
reported, but intracomparisons between groups were
carried out and p values were reported (castiglionegertsch et al. 2003). cumulative data presented by
castiglione-gertsch and colleagues (2000) demonstrated
that the combination of the three treatment arms resulted
in signiﬁcantly longer dfs compared with the no
treatment arm (77% vs 60%, p ¼ 0:02). one limitation
of the study was that no arms included tamoxifen because
at the time of the study conception, it was suggested that
tamoxifen would not be beneﬁcial in women less than 50
years of age (ebctcg 1992). more detailed results and
other studies need to be compared to better understand if
triplet therapy (chemotherapy + ovarian suppression +
other endocrine agents) is better than chemotherapy alone
or chemotherapy + tamoxifen.
to help answer these questions, three other complementary trials were initiated by the ibcsg in march 2003
to evaluate the use of chemotherapy, ovarian suppression,
and other endocrine therapies (tamoxifen or ais) as
adjuvant therapy. the soft trial (suppression of
ovarian function trial) is for women who remain
premenopausal after surgery or after the completion of
chemotherapy (francis et al. 2003). patients are randomized to three treatment arms: tamoxifen 20 mg daily for
5 years, tamoxifen + ovarian suppression with either
 xxxd3445xxx  3.75 mg every 28 days for 5 years or surgical
oophorectomy, or lastly exemestane 25 mg daily for 5
years + ovarian suppression. the second study, text
(tamoxifen and exemestane trial) is for women who plan
to receive ovarian suppression (tripterelin) from the start
of their adjuvant therapy and then are randomized to
receive either tamoxifen or exemestane concurrently. the
last trial, perche (premenopausal endocrine responsive chemotherapy) randomizes patients to ovarian
suppression plus hormonal therapy (tamoxifen or exemestane) or to a triplet arm of chemotherapy, ovarian
suppression plus hormonal therapy (tamoxifen or exemestane). the planned target accruals include 3000
patients for the soft trial, 1875 patients for the text
study, and 1750 patients for the perche trial (francis et
al. 2003).
these trials will help us better to understand
treatment options in these populations of patients. in
summary, these trials demonstrate ovarian suppression is

396

an effective means of reducing risk of recurrence in erpositive patients. results of these studies support the
point that ovarian suppression could be utilized as an
alternative to chemotherapy in this subset of patients. it
should be emphasized that unfortunately many of the
trials included er-negative patients and in many of them
tamoxifen was not included. when tamoxifen was added,
it was not in the chemotherapy arm and generally it was
added in the ovarian suppression arm.

mam-1 gocsi trial
the mam-1 gocsi trial began recruitment in 1992.
results have been published in abstract form (bianco et
al. 2001). this study ðn ¼ 446þ randomized node-positive,
premenopausal women to cmf (group a), doxorubicin
followed by cmf (group b), cmf followed by  xxxd2229xxx +tamoxifen (group c), and doxorubicin followed by
cmf followed by  xxxd2229xxx +tamoxifen (group d).
planned comparisons for rate of relapse were groups
a + c vs groups b + d, and groups a + b vs groups
c + d. after a median follow-up of 5 years, and adjusting
for tumor size, number of lymph nodes and hormone
receptor status, there was no difference in dfs between
the anthracycline-containing arms vs the non-anthracycline containing arms (hr = 0.86, p ¼ 0:42) there
was, however, a signiﬁcant difference between the
 xxxd2229xxx  plus tamoxifen containing arms vs the chemotherapy alone arms in dfs (hr = 0.71, p= 0.04). no
differences were demonstrated in os with the anthracycline-containing arms vs the non-anthracycline containing arms (hr = 0.79, p ¼ 0:31) and  xxxd2229xxx  plus
tamoxifen containing arms vs the chemotherapy alone
arms (hr = 0.86, p ¼ 0:52) (bianco et al. 2001). from
this limited data, it can be concluded that dfs is superior
for patients receiving chemo-endocrine treatment compared with chemotherapy alone in premenopausal
patients with breast cancer. no report on os was
published.

selected serms as adjuvant therapy
tamoxifen as monotherapy
in 1986, tamoxifen was the ﬁrst drug of its kind approved
as monotherapy for the treatment of early breast cancer in
node-positive, postmenopausal women. over the course
of almost 20 years, this indication has broadened (jordan
1999). the nolvadex adjuvant trial organisation
(nato) conducted one of the earliest trials identifying
tamoxifen’s beneﬁt in delaying recurrence (nato 1983).
patients were randomized to tamoxifen 10 mg twice daily
for 2 years ðn ¼ 559þ vs no further therapy ðn ¼ 565þ after
deﬁnitive surgery (total mastectomy with either axillary
nodal clearance or sampling). the mean follow-up was 21

endocrine-related cancer (2004) 11 391–406
months. signiﬁcantly fewer events deﬁned as ﬁrst
recurrence of breast cancer, including contralateral
disease or death without conﬁrmed recurrence, occurred
in the tamoxifen group compared with the no treatment
arm (14.2% vs 20.5% respectively, p ¼ 0:01). in a
subgroup analysis, there was no difference comparing
nodal status, menopausal status, or er positivity between
groups (nato 1983). this was the ﬁrst of many trials
conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of tamoxifen in
early breast cancer. at that time, many questions started
to surface regarding tamoxifen. does tamoxifen work in
both node-negative and -positive disease? does tamoxifen
work in er-positive and -negative disease? does tamoxifen work in both pre- and postmenopausal patients? for
how long should you treat with tamoxifen? these
questions were answered in subsequent trials.
the stockholm trial was designed for patients to
receive either no adjuvant hormonal therapy or tamoxifen
40 mg/day for 2 years in node-negative, postmenopausal
patients (rutqvist et al. 1992). during the course of the
study, the question was raised as to what the appropriate
length of tamoxifen therapy should be. this sparked a
new trial in which patients who were disease free (df) at 2
years were randomized to discontinue therapy or continue
with tamoxifen for a total of 5 years. after a median
follow-up of 7 years, tamoxifen exhibited signiﬁcant
prolongation of dfs compared with the control arm
ðp < 0:01þ and fewer deaths ðp ¼ 0:02þ. survival (when
analyzing all causes of death) was not signiﬁcantly better
with tamoxifen ðp ¼ 0:11þ. as expected based on what we
know about er status and response to therapy with
tamoxifen, beneﬁt was documented only in er-positive
patients.
in a further follow-up of 5 years, the event free
survival and os were statistically signiﬁcant for the 5-year
tamoxifen group (p ¼ 0:03 and p ¼ 0:009 respectively).
 xxxd1891xxx  years, 80% of the 5-year group and 74% of the 2year group were alive and recurrence free. beneﬁt was
shown regardless of lymph node status, and was identiﬁed
in er-positive patients (rutqvist et al. 1992).
the scottish trialists group conducted two tamoxifen
trials. the ﬁrst study consisted of patients being
randomized to tamoxifen 20 mg/day for 5 years vs
tamoxifen 20 mg/day for the treatment until ﬁrst relapse
(control arm) (breast cancer trials committee & scottish
cancer trials ofﬁce 1987). patients ðn ¼ 1312þ were
enrolled with a median follow-up of 47 months. at the
time of analysis, 157 patients (24%) in the tamoxifen arm
and 250 patients (38%) in the control arm had developed
recurrent disease. the delay in recurrence rate was evident
regardless of nodal status. dfs and os were signiﬁcantly
better in the tamoxifen arm compared with the control
arm (p < 0:0001 and p ¼ 0:002 respectively).

another question the investigators wanted to answer
was the best duration of therapy. patients who received
tamoxifen for 5 years were then allowed randomization to
stop therapy ðn ¼ 169þ or continue tamoxifen until relapse
ðn ¼ 173þ. fifteen-year follow-up results have now been
published (stewart et al. 2001). the median duration of
tamoxifen for the 5-year group was 60 months (range 56–
205) and in the continuation arm it was 163 months
(range 58–205). overall survival was signiﬁcantly better in
patients taking tamoxifen for 5 years compared with those
allocated to continue tamoxifen until recurrence
(hr = 0.78, p ¼ 0:006). other primary malignancies
were identiﬁed in this trial across the different treatment
arms including endometrial, uterine and ovarian cancers;
however, statistical signiﬁcance of this difference was not
achieved. data in the 5-year arm demonstrated an
increased risk of endometrial cancer (n ¼ 8 vs 2 in the
continuation arm) compared with a decreased risk of
contralateral breast cancer (n ¼ 19 vs n ¼ 2 in the
continuation arm) (stewart et al. 2001). this trial more
clearly identiﬁed the beneﬁt of tamoxifen when given for a
duration of 5 years.
one of the most important trials conducted was the
nsabp b-14 trial which evaluated er-positive, nodenegative patients with 5 years vs more than 5 years of
tamoxifen treatment (fisher et al. 1996). during the ﬁrst
randomization of tamoxifen vs placebo for 5 years,
distant disease-free survival (ddfs) was 76% with
tamoxifen compared with 67% with placebo
ðp < 0:0001þ. overall survival was also signiﬁcantly
improved for the 5-year tamoxifen arm ðp ¼ 0:02þ during
the 5–10 years of follow-up. disease-free survival regardless of age (<50 or > 50) was statistically signiﬁcant. hot
ﬂushes, vaginal discharge, irregular menses, deep vein
thrombosis, and endometrial cancer occurred more
frequently in the tamoxifen arm (fisher et al. 1993, 1996).
the duration question was tested when patients who
had received 5 years of tamoxifen were then randomized
to 5 more years of tamoxifen (total 10 years, n ¼ 583) or
placebo (total 5 years, n ¼ 570). with a 4-year follow-up,
dfs was signiﬁcantly longer for those who were switched
from tamoxifen to placebo — 92% vs 86% in those
patients who continued tamoxifen for 10 years
ðp ¼ 0:003þ. survival rates were not signiﬁcant at 4
years in the 5-year group compared with the other arm
(96% and 94% respectively, p ¼ 0:08). disease-free
survival, ddfs, and os were not affected by age.
patients treated for 5 years with tamoxifen experienced
fewer recurrences compared with those assigned to the
longer treatment arm. safety proﬁles were also more
favorable in those patients treated for 5 years with
tamoxifen compared with those receiving tamoxifen for

397

jones and buzdar: adjuvant hormonal therapy
10 years. side effects were similar to those reported in the
earlier part of the trial (fisher et al. 1993, 1996).
the nsabp b-14 trial was closed early due to the
interim analysis identifying no additional beneﬁt of
tamoxifen past 5 years. this study reported a 12%
absolute difference in dfs and a 28% reduction in
treatment failure. b-14 conﬁrmed that tamoxifen should
be used for 5 years in node-negative, er-positive patients.
the authors stated that tamoxifen should also be used in
node-positive patients until further data were available to
say otherwise (fisher et al. 1993, 1996).
ebctcg (1998) evaluated the largest comparison of
tamoxifen vs no tamoxifen in a meta-analysis of 55 trials.
women were identiﬁed from trials of tamoxifen for early
breast cancer prior to 1990 and were divided into three
treatment groups of tamoxifen: (1) about 1 year of
tamoxifen, (2) 2 years of tamoxifen, (3) more than 2 years
of tamoxifen. tamoxifen therapy signiﬁcantly reduced
recurrence rates by 18%, 25%, and 42% according to
their treatment period (1 year, 2 year, 5 years respectively,
2p < 0:00001). mortality was also signiﬁcantly reduced
by 10% (1 year), 15% (2 years), and 22% (5 years)
ð2p < 0:00001þ.
this analysis continued to show the beneﬁt of
tamoxifen in women with er-positive tumors
(dfs = 21%, 28%, and 50% for 1 year, 2 years and 5
years respectively) as well as proportional reductions in
death of 14%, 18% and 28% respectively ðp < 0:00001þ.
the beneﬁt identiﬁed was only in er-positive patients.
beneﬁt from tamoxifen in dfs and os was no different
regardless of lymph node status or age. contralateral
breast cancer reductions were 13%, 26% and 47% for the
different durations of therapy (1 year, 2 years and 5 years
respectively, 2p < 0:00001). the continued analysis of
these data every 5 years has directed us to use tamoxifen
in er-positive patients regardless of lymph node or
menopausal status (ebctcg 1998).
the question of duration of therapy was also
evaluated in a multicenter trial by the swedish breast
cancer cooperative group, which addressed 2 years
ðn ¼ 1801þ vs 5 years of tamoxifen therapy ðn ¼ 1744þ in
postmenopausal patients regardless of nodal status
(swedish breast cancer cooperative group 1996b). the
stockholm trial previously mentioned was a part of this
larger trial and patients contributed information to both
trials. event-free survival and os were signiﬁcantly
improved with 5 years of therapy compared with only 2
years (p ¼ 0:009 and p ¼ 0:03 respectively). the overall
absolute reduction in death was 18% with a 10-year
survival beneﬁt of 6% in the 5-year arm. once again,
tamoxifen for 5 years was shown to be beneﬁcial in erpositive patients regardless of nodal status (swedish
breast cancer cooperative group 1996a,b). in an update

398

presented at asco in 2003, dfs and os continued to be
statistically signiﬁcant for the group assigned to 5 years of
tamoxifen (p ¼ 0:00001 and p ¼ 0:0002 respectively)
(nordenskjold et al. 2003). contralateral breast cancer
continued to be signiﬁcantly reduced (relative risk (rr)
= 0.68, p ¼ 0:03); however, there was an increased risk of
developing endometrial cancer in the 5-year group
(rr = 1.65, p ¼ 0:05). in this study, patients treated for
5 years with tamoxifen experienced fewer coronary events
compared with the patients treated for 2 years with
tamoxifen. this may have implications for ongoing trials
with ais.
other studies are continually evaluating the duration
question (breast cancer trials committee & scottish
cancer trials ofﬁce 1987, current trials working party
of the cancer research campaign breast cancer trials
group 1996, fisher et al. 1996). two ongoing trials are
evaluating tamoxifen for 5 years and longer. the atlas
(adjuvant tamoxifen-longer against shorter) and the
attom (adjuvant tamoxifen treatment offers more)
trials plan to recruit over 20 000 patients to assist in
answering this question (gray et al. 1997, davies et al.
1998).

tamoxifen vs  xxxd3402xxx 
 xxxd3402xxx  (a triphenylethylene antiestrogen) was developed with the premise to demonstrate similar efﬁcacy to
tamoxifen but with fewer side effects (tomas et al. 1995,
wiseman & goa 1997, marttunen et al. 1998). tamoxifen
has been compared with  xxxd3402xxx  in postmenopausal
patients with node-positive breast cancer in the adjuvant
setting (holli et al. 2000). patients were randomized to
receive tamoxifen 20 mg daily ðn ¼ 440þ or  xxxd3402xxx 
40 mg daily ðn ¼ 459þ for 3 years. at the time of the
analysis, the median follow-up was 3.4 years. recurrence
rates, os, and side effect proﬁles were not signiﬁcantly
different between the groups. sweating and hot ﬂushes
were the most common side effects reported (holli et al.
2000). the authors concluded that  xxxd3402xxx  had similar
efﬁcacy and toxicity to tamoxifen in postmenopausal,
node-positive early breast cancer patients.
the ibcsg conducted two randomized trials of
 xxxd3402xxx  (60 mg/day) compared with tamoxifen
(20 mg/day) for 5 years in a similar population of patients
(pagani et al. 2003). the ibcsg trial 12–93 and ibcsg
trial 14–93 randomized 1035 patients. seventy-nine
percent of patients had er-positive breast cancer. at
4.9 years of median follow-up, the dfs was 74% and
70% for  xxxd3402xxx  and tamoxifen respectively. these
results were not signiﬁcantly different and  xxxd3402xxx  was
considered equivalent to tamoxifen in this setting. these
data were presented in abstract form only and no
information regarding toxicity was discussed (pagani et

endocrine-related cancer (2004) 11 391–406
al. 2003). today, we have much more extensive long-term
evidence to support tamoxifen’s use in the adjuvant
setting compared with  xxxd3402xxx .  xxxd3402xxx  is not
approved in the adjuvant setting. of note, the approved
dose of  xxxd3402xxx  in the metastatic setting is 60 mg daily
which is different from what was used in one of the
previously stated adjuvant trials.

tamoxifen plus chemotherapy
the addition of chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting
requires the evaluation of many factors. intermediate and
high-risk patients should receive chemotherapy þ/
tamoxifen depending on their hormonal receptor status.
other things to consider are age, performance status, and
patient preference (goldhirsch et al. 1998). the ebctcg
has conducted a meta-analysis of randomized trials to
evaluate the treatment of breast cancer. in the latest
published update, polychemotherapy plus tamoxifen
continued to demonstrate a beneﬁcial reduction of
recurrence in er-positive patients regardless of age or
menopausal status. contralateral breast cancer and
survival were also improved with combination therapy
irrespective of age and menopausal status (ebctcg
1988). optimal sequences of treatment modalities have
recently been evaluated and patients offered antiestrogen
therapy after completion of chemotherapy experienced

fewer risks of recurrence compared with concomitant
administration of the two modalities (albain et al. 2002).

aromatase inhibitors
ais are currently being studied extensively in the adjuvant
setting. several major trials are underway evaluating these
agents (see table 4). the earliest food and drug
administration (fda)-approved ai was  xxxd147xxx . this ﬁrst generation ai has been compared
with tamoxifen in the adjuvant setting. although efﬁcacy
was exhibited with  xxxd147xxx , a lack of survival
beneﬁt compared with tamoxifen was observed at an 8year follow up (jones et al. 1992). due to its nonspeciﬁcity for the aromatase enzyme,  xxxd147xxx 
has numerous side effects and supplemental hydrocortisone must be administered concomitantly. the austrian
breast and colorectal cancer study group conducted
one combination trial with tamoxifen and  xxxd147xxx  (schmid et al. 2003). patients ðn ¼ 2021þ were
randomized to receive either tamoxifen (40 mg/day for
the ﬁrst 2 years, then 20 mg daily for 3 years) or the
combination of tamoxifen (same regimen) plus  xxxd147xxx  (500 mg/daily for the ﬁrst 2 years). at the
median follow-up of 5.3 years, dfs was not signiﬁcantly
different between combination therapy and tamoxifen

groups (83.6% vs 83.7% respectively, p ¼ 0:89). overall
survival was not different either (91.4% vs 91.2%
respectively, p ¼ 0:74). more patients in the combination
arm failed to complete therapy due to side effects (14%)
compared with 5.2% of the tamoxifen arm ðp ¼ 0:0001þ
(schmid et al. 2003). today  xxxd147xxx  is not
routinely used in clinical practice.
with newer more speciﬁc ais, efﬁcacy has improved
and the number of side effects has decreased. as
previously mentioned, many trials are currently underway
with ais in the adjuvant setting (see table 4). anastrozole
(arimidex), letrozole (femara), and exemestane ( xxxd2075xxx ) have all provided data that has helped slowly shift the
paradigm of hormonal therapy in the adjuvant setting.

anastrozole
anastrozole is currently fda approved for ﬁrst and
second line metastatic breast cancer as well as in early
breast cancer. this approval in the adjuvant setting was
based on the results of the atac trial (arimidex,
tamoxifen alone or in combination), which is the
largest, single cancer treatment study published to date
(baum et al. 2002). patients were randomized to receive
anastrozole 1 mg daily ðn ¼ 3125þ, tamoxifen 20 mg daily
ðn ¼ 3116þ, or the combination daily ðn ¼ 3125þ for
5 years. this was a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial in postmenopausal women who had completed
primary therapy (surgery and/or chemotherapy) for their
invasive breast cancer. disease-free survival, safety and
tolerability were the primary end points. secondary
endpoints included time to recurrence (ttr) and
incidence of new contralateral primary breast tumors,
distant recurrences, and overall survival.
analysis of the data was planned after 1056 events.
the treatment groups were well-balanced overall, with
84% of patients with hormone-positive breast cancer and
34% with node-positive disease. only 8% of patients were
 xxxg1603xxx  negative and 8% of patients had an
unknown  xxxg1603xxx  status. this is important
because previous ai trials have been criticized due to large
numbers of patients with unknown hormonal status
(nabholtz et al. 2000).
at the time of the ﬁrst analysis, 1079 events had
occurred. the median duration of therapy was 30.7
months with a median follow-up of 33.3 months. diseasefree survival was signiﬁcantly greater with anastrozole
compared with tamoxifen alone (10.1% vs 12.1%) (hr
0.83, p ¼ 0:013). the combination arm was not signiﬁcantly different compared with tamoxifen alone (12.2% vs
12.1%) (hr 1.02, p ¼ 0:8). no difference in death from
breast cancer or other reasons was identiﬁed across the
treatment groups (see table 5).

 xxxg1603xxx -positive disease yielded the best
beneﬁt in terms of dfs and ttr. disease-free survival
was signiﬁcantly better for anastrozole compared with
tamoxifen (hr = 0.82; 95% ci, 0.70–0.96; p ¼ 0:014), as
well as when compared with the combination arm of
anastrozole and tamoxifen (hr = 1.03; 95% ci, 0.89–
1.20; p ¼ 0:8). no difference in beneﬁt was identiﬁed
between the tamoxifen and combination arms. time to
recurrence was longer in the anastrozole group than with
tamoxifen and no difference was demonstrated in the
tamoxifen alone arm compared with the combination
group or in those patients with er-negative disease. due
to the lack of superiority of the combination arm over
tamoxifen in either efﬁcacy or safety, the combination
arm was closed after the ﬁrst analysis. at that time, all of
the participants on the combination arm of the trial were
informed of the results and it was left to the patients and
their physicians to decide which one of the two drugs
should be discontinued. patients on the two single arms of
the study (anastrozole or tamoxifen alone) remained on
the study without breaking the treatment code.
one of the most revealing results was in the reduction
of primary contralateral breast cancers. when compared
with tamoxifen, anastrozole demonstrated a 58% risk
reduction (hr 0.42, p ¼ 0:0068). no statistically signiﬁcant difference was found with tamoxifen compared with
the combination group (16% reduction, p ¼ 0:5). these
results illustrate anastrozole’s superiority over tamoxifen
for the treatment of postmenopausal women with early
breast cancer.
side effects are an important primary endpoint due to
the known toxicities of tamoxifen. the combination arm
did not demonstrate differences in toxicities when
compared with tamoxifen; however, anastrozole revealed
signiﬁcant reductions in hot ﬂushes, vaginal discharge,
vaginal bleeding, ischemic cerebrovascular events, and
endometrial cancer. on the other hand, anastrozole
exhibited more musculoskeletal disorders and fractures
(see table 6).
overall, anastrozole showed better efﬁcacy compared
with tamoxifen with a relative risk reduction of 17% in

endocrine-related cancer (2004) 11 391–406

dfs. when evaluating only hormone-positive disease, the
relative risk reduction for ttr was 27% compared with
tamoxifen. in addition, the incidence of contralateral
cancer was signiﬁcantly improved with a 58% reduction
with anastrozole vs tamoxifen, and the side effect proﬁle
was considerably better with anastrozole (baum et al.
2002). concerns regarding fracture risk, changes in lipid
proﬁles, and changes in cognition continue, as we do not
know the long-term risks of anastrozole in the adjuvant
setting.
at the time of publication, many clinicians were
sceptical of the atac results with a short median
follow-up of 33 months. this led to the formation of a
working group by asco to address these issues. a report
was published in 2002 and then again in 2003 with the
updated efﬁcacy data (winer et al. 2002, 2003a). after
careful consideration, the group continued its position on
the opinion that only a small number of patients have been
followed for 5 years of ai therapy (which is considered the
standard length of therapy for tamoxifen). recommendations were not updated due to the absence of differences in
survival or any increased efﬁcacy or toxicity. anastrozole
was recommended in postmenopausal women who have an
absolute or relative contraindication to tamoxifen. the 47month updated analysis of the trial has conﬁrmed the
initial advantage of anastrozole over tamoxifen; however,
additional follow-up of the study will deﬁne its impact on
survival (winer et al. 2003b).
more results with longer follow-up data have now
been presented and published. the atac trialists group
presented data with a 47-month median follow-up (baum
et al. 2003, klijn & for the atac trialists’ group 2003).
anastrozole continued to demonstrate beneﬁt in dfs vs
tamoxifen (hr = 0.82 (95% ci = 0.70–0.96), p ¼ 0:014).
no difference was identiﬁed in the comparison of
tamoxifen vs the combination arm. the absolute difference in dfs continued to increase over 4 years from 1.5%
in the intent-to-treat group and 1.7% in the hormone-

positive arm at 3 years. at the 4-year follow-up, the
numbers have increased to 2.4% in the overall intent-totreat group and 2.9% in the  xxxg1603xxx -positive
arm (baum et al. 2003, klijn & for the atac trialists’
group 2003).
in addition to efﬁcacy, further analyses of toxicities
have also been presented. locker and easterll (2003)
illustrated the time course of bone fractures in patients
undergoing up to 48 months of treatment with adjuvant
anastrozole compared with tamoxifen. at both 31 and 37
months, the risk of fractures was similar with anastrozole
(rr=1.59 and 1.60 respectively) indicating no worsening
of risk over time. the biggest difference was identiﬁed
between 18 and 24 months. after 2 years of anastrozole,
the fracture rate reaches its peak and starts to plateau
(locker & easterll 2003). this is the longest follow-up
data published to date regarding these toxicities.
at the 2003 san antonio breast cancer symposium,
duffy and greenwood (2003) presented data regarding
endometrial cancer rates in patients on the atac trial.
standard incidence rates (sir) were analyzed to compare
rates seen with anastrozole with those of an age-matched
standard population. anastrozole rates of endometrial
cancer were demonstrated to be lower than tamoxifen
(sir = 0.73 (95% ci = 0.15–2.12) and 2.68 (95% ci =
1.34–4.80) respectively). this toxicity proﬁle as well as
cognition changes, changes in lipid proﬁles and fracture
risks will continue to be prospectively collected. quality of
life has been evaluated in a predeﬁned subset of patients.
overall, there were no signiﬁcant differences in quality of
life in patients on anastrozole compared with tamoxifen;
however, patients treated with anastrozole experienced
increased frequency of estrogen deprivation symptoms in
the form of vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and loss of
interest in sex (fallowﬁeld 2002).
another interesting trial presented by boccardo et al.
in 2003 at the san antonio breast symposium, revealed
that anastrozole was superior to tamoxifen in women who
were already receiving tamoxifen. they randomized 426
patients to receive either tamoxifen 20 mg daily for 5 years
or 2 years of tamoxifen followed by 3 years of anastrozole
1 mg daily. the primary endpoints were disease recurrence, second primary tumor, or death. at the time of the
analysis, patients had a median follow-up of 24 months.
for those patients switched to anastrozole therapy,
relapse rates (hr = 0.36, p ¼ 0:006) as well as death
rates (hr = 0.18, p ¼ 0:07) were reduced. this study
showed the increased beneﬁt of adding a sequential
aromatase inhibitor after tamoxifen therapy (boccardo
et al. 2003). even though this is a short follow-up, it does
pose the question: should we be switching all of our
patients who are on tamoxifen over to anastrozole? the
answer to this question has not been fully answered.

jones and buzdar: adjuvant hormonal therapy
letrozole
the most recent publication on letrozole has generated a
new thought process in the management of patients with
adjuvant hormonal therapy. it is known that extending
tamoxifen use to 10 years does not add any beneﬁt in os,
and increases toxicity (fisher et al. 1996). a randomized
trial of letrozole in postmenopausal women after completing 5 years of tamoxifen therapy for early stage breast
cancer, better known as the ma-17 trial, was conducted
to ﬁnd out if adding a sequential ai after tamoxifen
would increase dfs. the national cancer institute of
canada clinical trialist group in a joint effort with the
north american intergroup and the breast international
group led this study. this was a double-blind, placebocontrolled trial. patients were randomized to receive
letrozole 2.5 mg daily ðn ¼ 2593þ for 5 years or placebo
ðn ¼ 2594þ for 5 years. both arms were initiated after
completing 5 years of tamoxifen. disease-free survival was
the primary endpoint and secondary endpoints included
os, quality of life, and safety.
patients had to have completed at least 4.5–6 years of
tamoxifen, be er-positive or unknown, and not to have
discontinued tamoxifen more than 3 months prior to
enrollment. statistical methods included two interim
analyses to be conducted after 171 and 342 events.
based on the statistical design, early termination would
be considered based on results.
the ﬁrst analysis was conducted after 207 events with
a median follow-up of 2.4 years. the estimated 4-year
dfs in the letrozole arm was 93% compared with 87% in
the placebo arm (hr = 0.57, p ¼ 0:00068). fewer local
regional and distant recurrences were identiﬁed in the
treatment group vs placebo (2.4% and 4.1% respectively)
as well as contralateral breast cancer (0.5% and 1%
respectively). the 4-year estimated os was not signiﬁcantly better for letrozole ðp ¼ 0:25þ compared with
placebo.
the toxicity proﬁle was evaluated secondarily and
illustrated the letrozole arm having signiﬁcantly more hot
ﬂushes, arthritis, arthralgias, and myalgias compared with
the placebo arm ðp ¼ 0:05þ. vaginal bleeding was more
common in the placebo group ðp ¼ 0:01þ. trends
demonstrating higher rates of newly diagnosed osteoporosis with letrozole compared with placebo were
identiﬁed ðp ¼ 0:07þ. as is the case with anastrozole,
more long-term data need to be collected regarding bone
toxicities with these agents.
overall, letrozole was shown to lower the risk of
recurrence by 43% and improve the estimated 4-year dfs
by 6% and os by 2%. with these results, letrozole has
become the ﬁrst ai to demonstrate beneﬁt in the extended
adjuvant setting beyond early tamoxifen (goss et al.
2003). because of these overwhelmingly positive results,

402

the data and safety monitoring committee recommended
to stop this trial and make the results public.
by stopping the trial after the initial planned analysis,
many questions remain unanswered such as the optimal
duration of treatment, long-term toxicity, and its impact
on survival. two editorials published in the same issue of
the new england journal of medicine addressed some of
these concerns.
bryant and wolmark (2003) raised concerns regarding trials recently stopped due to early interim analysis.
the ma-17 trial did have a strict statistical design
formulated to stop the study early; however, was that
truly beneﬁcial in answering the clinical questions
proposed at the beginning of the trial? the primary aim
of the study was to determine dfs and secondarily os of
letrozole administered for 5 years after tamoxifen. this
was not accomplished with only a median follow-up of 2.4
years. true beneﬁt in survival will never be known due to
the crossover ability given to patients when the results
were made public. bryant’s conclusions reiterated a need
for a new approach to clinical trials with reinforcement to
ensure that trials are not stopped early, leaving important
clinical questions unanswered.
burstein (2003) repeated the same concerns, particularly the short follow-up period, lack of long-term safety
information, and limited absolute beneﬁt with letrozole.
after early release of these results, investigators from the
nsabp b-33 trial (a randomized, placebo-controlled,
double-blind trial evaluating the effect of exemestane in
postmenopausal breast cancers completing at least 5 years
of tamoxifen therapy) have suspended accrual. this study
provided important new information that alternate,
potentially non cross-resistant endocrine therapies can
favorably change the natural history of the disease.
closure of this trial after the initial analysis, however,
failed to answer two important questions: ﬁrst, what
should be the optimal duration of treatment with ais; and
secondly what ultimately will be the impact on survival?
many other trials are currently underway evaluating ais
in the adjuvant setting and many of them will likely be
modiﬁed or terminated based on these results.

exemestane
joining the ranks with the other ais, exemestane now has
published information regarding its use in the adjuvant
setting. the intergroup exemestane study evaluated
sequential exemestane after tamoxifen or tamoxifen
alone (coombes et al. 2004). this was a phase iii
randomized, double-blind trial which randomized
women to receive tamoxifen 20 mg daily for a total of 5
years ðn ¼ 2362þ or exemestane 25 mg daily for 2 to 3 years
sequentially after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen ðn ¼ 2380þ.
the primary endpoint was dfs (recurrence, diagnosis of

endocrine-related cancer (2004) 11 391–406
a second breast cancer, or death). secondarily, investigators evaluated os, incidence of contralateral breast
cancer, and tolerability.  xxxg730xxx -positive
patients or those with unknown hormonal status were
eligible. postmenopausal patients (55 years of age or older
with amenorrhea for > 2 years, or amenorrhea for > 1
year at diagnosis) and those who had received more than
2 years of tamoxifen but no more than 3 years and 1
month were eligible for randomization. patients were
excluded if they had er-negative disease, were on
hormone replacement therapy within 4 weeks of study
enrollment, had severe osteoporosis, other cancers, or if
they were taking concomitant anticoagulants or any other
form of hormonal therapy. this trial was designed to
detect an absolute difference of 3.6% in dfs at 3 years. a
planned interim analysis was to be conducted after 716
events occurred. after the second interim analysis
reporting on 358 events, it was decided by the safety
and monitoring committee to release the results of the
study. the adjusted dfs for exemestane included 144
events compared with the tamoxifen arm with 227 events
(hr = 0.63, 95% ci = 0.51–0.77, p ¼ 0:0001).
at 3 years, the dfs was 91.5% in the exemestane
group vs 86.8% in the tamoxifen group for an absolute
beneﬁt of 4.7% (hr = 0.68, p < 0:001). contralateral
breast cancer was also signiﬁcantly reduced in the
exemestane arm compared with tamoxifen (hr = 0.44,
95% ci = 0.20–0.98, p ¼ 0:04). survival at this stage of
data collection is not statistically signiﬁcant as would be
expected (hr = 0.88, 95% ci = 0.67–1.16, p ¼ 0:37)
with a median follow-up of 30.6 months.
the authors did state that the data with regard to side
effects were ‘provisional’ due to the early release of the
efﬁcacy data. tamoxifen patients experienced more
problems with vaginal bleeding (5.5% vs 4%, p ¼ 0:05),
muscle cramps (4.4% vs 2.8%, p < 0:001) and thromboembolic disease (1.9% vs 1%, p ¼ 0:03). exemestane
patients were documented to have more arthralgias (5.4%
vs 3.6%, p ¼ 0:01) and diarrhea (4.3% vs 2.3%,
p < 0:001) compared with tamoxifen.
as demonstrated with other aromatase inhibitors,
exemestane did cause more cases of fractures compared
with tamoxifen (7.4% vs 5.7%, p ¼ 0:05). visual disturbances, which were not discussed in more detail, were
reported more in the exemestane arm (7.4% vs 5.7%,
p ¼ 0:04). the number of cardiovascular events in this
trial were high but no explanation as to how this was
deﬁned was speciﬁed. in this study, 42.6% of exemestane
patients and 39.2% of tamoxifen patients ðp ¼ 0:11þ fell
into this category.
contralateral breast cancer and dfs were signiﬁcantly improved with the use of sequential exemestane
after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen therapy. the median

follow-up at the time of data release was 30.6 months, so
differences in overall survival were not signiﬁcant. the
authors do state that at the time of publication, more than
90% of patients would have completed their therapy,
which could add more signiﬁcance to this data. there are
numerous reasons postulated as to why sequential
endocrine therapy works, but no one answer has been
identiﬁed. these questions are slowly being answered. we
know from the atac trial that anastrozole is better than
tamoxifen in terms of efﬁcacy (baum et al. 2003).
sequential letrozole after 5 years of tamoxifen has
shown superiority in the ma-17 trial (goss et al. 2003).
anastrozole and exemestane have been shown to further
decrease the incidence of recurrences in postmenopausal
women. the role of letrozole and exemestane as initial
treatment instead of tamoxifen remains to be deﬁned by
ongoing trials. currently, the only ai that is fdaapproved in the adjuvant setting is anastrozole; however,
a detailed discussion regarding efﬁcacy, toxicity, and
timing of tamoxifen, anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane should be conducted in all postmenopausal patients
faced with the decision of taking adjuvant hormonal
therapy.

conclusions
the role of hormonal therapy has evolved over the course
of 100 years. once it was identiﬁed that estrogen played
an important role in breast cancer, new therapies were
created to inhibit its production and function. ovarian
ablation is a therapeutic option for premenopausal breast
cancer patients. the ebctcg trial demonstrated that
dfs and os were better in those women who received
ovarian ablation (i.e.  xxxd2229xxx ) compared with those
patients who did not receive any adjuvant treatment.
when compared with chemotherapy (cmf-like regimens), ovarian ablation showed equivalency, with a better
side effects proﬁle. the reversibility of ovarian function is
an important caveat. with  xxxg930xxx  agonists such as
 xxxd2229xxx , ovarian function can be reversible and can be
offered to those patients who wish to maintain function or
have children. with the addition of tamoxifen to ovarian
ablation, hormonal manipulation has been shown to be
more effective than cmf-containing regimens. other
trials are currently underway to evaluate different  xxxg930xxx 
agonists and other hormonal therapy combinations with
or without chemotherapy in premenopausal breast cancer
patients.
tamoxifen has been the mainstay of hormonal
therapy for many years in early breast cancer. it has
proven to be effective but it does have a number of side
effects. with the creation of ais, patients now have
another option with better tolerability. the results of the

403

jones and buzdar: adjuvant hormonal therapy
atac trial provided anastrozole as another alternative to
tamoxifen therapy in postmenopausal women. this drug
has resulted in reductions in the risk of recurrence and an
overall better safety proﬁle than tamoxifen. recent results
of the ma-17 trial have demonstrated a beneﬁt with
letrozole used sequentially after 5 years of tamoxifen. the
data in the exemestane and anastrozole trials for 2 to 3
years after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen have demonstrated
that changing therapy to an ai instead of completing 5
years of tamoxifen can signiﬁcantly reduce the risk of
recurrence. a number of trials are ongoing which will
further deﬁne the optimal way to utilize ais in the
adjuvant setting. the world of hormonal therapy continues to evolve and it is prudent to discuss the many
different options with our patients as they now have
choices regarding endocrine therapy.

funding
there is no conﬂict of interest that would prejudice
impartiality or be a potential conﬂict of interest for the
authors. dr buzdar has received research grants from
astra zeneca, pﬁzer, and novartis.
