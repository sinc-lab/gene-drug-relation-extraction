expert opinion

background: diabetes and ageing are associated with erectile dysfunction (ed).
under these conditions, increased oxidative stress produces superoxide ions,
which in turn suppresses the  xxxd2738xxx -cyclic  xxxd1067xxx 
pathway. the phophodiesterase-5 (pde5) inhibitors still remain ineffective in
15 – 57% of impotent men. objective: to identify the efficacy of conventional
and novel pde5 inhibitors on oxidative stress involved in diabetes and ageing.
methods: an electronic search of the literature was conducted to review
published information relating diabetes and ageing to ed and to cover latestage developments of novel pde5 inhibitors. results/conclusion: safe and
more efficacious alternatives that can modulate pde5 levels in ed regarding
oxidative stress conditions are needed. included in this review are updates
on the new pde5 inhibitors  xxxd250xxx ,  xxxd3464xxx , slx-2101, and mirodenafil.

introduction

impairment in erectile function (ef) affects quality of life for millions of men
and their partners. the mechanism for erectile dysfunction (ed) in conditions
such as diabetes mellitus (dm) and/or ageing involves in part the downregulation
of the  xxxd2738xxx  (no)-cyclic  xxxd1067xxx  (cgmp) pathway
(figure 1) [1,2]. with the introduction of sildenafil, there has been a greater awareness
regarding the prevalence of and available treatments for ed. the development of
novel phosphodiesterase type 5 (pde5) inhibitors may offer alternatives for a
greater number of ed patients and allow for more convenient dosage schedules
with few adverse effects.
while research studies have documented specific enzymatic sources for reactive
oxygen species (ros) generation, it is recognized that there are complex interactions
in different body systems generating ros (figure 1). this review describes the
basic oxidative stress-related mechanisms that underlie observed pathophysiologies.
further exploration in this area of research will contribute to the design of alternate
pharmaceutical agents that may salvage ed patients who are non-responsive
to pde5 inhibitors.

what is normal erectile function?

during erection the penis acts as a capacitor, accumulating blood under pressure [3].
this function depends on two key events: dilatation of the resistance arterial bed

and/or ageing stimulates o2- production within endothelial and smooth muscle cells, which may inactivate no and inhibit sgc directly,
thereby diminishing cgk-1 activity. onoo- may inhibit sgc directly and it uncouples enos by oxidizing zinc thiolate complexes within
enos and/or by oxidizing the nos cofactor bh4 to bh2. this concept, however, also means that uncoupling of enos would require a
priming event such as superoxide produced by nadph oxidase and/or xo.

of the penis, enhancing blood flow and pressure to the corpora
cavernosa; and relaxation of the trabecular smooth
muscle, allowing the expansion of the lacunar spaces and
trapping blood by compression of the peripheral draining
venules (veno-occlusive mechanism) [4]. an important function
of no is the activation of no-sensitive  xxxg1587xxx 
(gc), which leads to an enhanced conversion of guanosine
triphosphate (gtp) to intracellular cgmp (figure 1). cgmp
is an important mediator of smooth muscle relaxation and
a key molecular regulator of penile tumescence. the effects
of cgmp are exerted through activation of different
effectors, such as cgmp-gated ion channels [5,6], cgmpdependent protein kinases [6,7] and cgmp-regulated
pdes [8]. a novel calcium channel pathway in cavernosal
smooth muscle cells that regulates no-cgmp effects has
been recently reported [9].
2.1

importance of oxygen tension in the penis

previous data have revealed that oxygen tension plays an
active role in regulating penile erection. oxygen tension in
the corpus cavernosum in the flaccid state approximates the
venous po2 levels in the circulation [10]. at these levels,
synthesis of no in the corpus cavernosum is inhibited,
allowing for trabecular smooth muscle contraction. sacral
parasympathetic stimulation initiates vasodilatation of the
resistance arterial bed, increases arterial flows, and enhances
856

intracavernosal oxygen content (90 – 100 mmhg po2). in this
oxygen-enhanced environment, autonomic nerves and the
endothelium are able to synthesize no, mediate trabecular
smooth muscle relaxation, and entrap blood in the corpora
cavernosa for erection.
endothelial cells generate ros, including superoxide
(o2-),  xxxd2298xxx  (h2o2), no, peroxynitrite (onoo-),
hydroxyl radicals (oh), and other radicals. superoxide reacts
with no at a significantly faster rate than with superoxide
dismutase (sod), causing a decrease in no levels to the high
nanomolar range, and no combines with o2-· to generate
onoo-, which further depletes no (figure 1). ros directly
affect blood vessel walls by inducing a chronic inflammationlike reaction, one of the ‘risk factors’ for vascular
disease. ros also function as signaling molecules for many
growth-factor-mediated physiological responses.
2.2

diabetes and oxidative stress

accumulating evidence suggests that the development of ed
in diabetes is associated with increased oxidative stress [10,11].
intracellular hyperglycemia induces overproduction of o2-· at
the mitochondrial level, which is the key event in the activation
of a number of pathways involved in the pathogenesis
of diabetic complications, such as polyol pathway flux,
increased advanced glycation end product (age) formation,
activation of protein kinase c (pkc), activation of nuclear

o2- reacting with no produces onoo- (figure 1). the o2-·
anion interacts with no, forming the potent cytotoxin
onoo-, which attacks various biomolecules and damages
dna. researchers have shown that the antioxidant  xxxd3521xxx 
enhances the therapeutic effect of the pde5 inhibitor
sildenafil in the diabetic rat model [11].
2.3

ageing and oxidative stress

oxidative stress is an important factor contributing to
endothelial dysfunction in ageing. penises obtained from older
rats displayed an increase in nitrotyrosine immunostaining
(tissue oxidative stress) [12,13]. both the endothelium
and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle of aged rat penises
produced high levels of o2-· anion compared with
younger animals. in experiments employing gene transfer
of the sod enzyme, there was a reduction of o2-· anion
formation and normalization of ef [14].
3. diabetes and ageing-induced erectile
dysfunction

more than 50% of diabetic men develop ed within
10 years of the diagnosis of diabetes, and the prevalence
of ed continues to rise with age [15]. the management
of ed in the diabetic man involves a multidisciplinary
approach with contributions from urologists, diabetologists,
and sex counselors.
age-associated changes in sexual function consist of a
decreased arousal, softer erections, and a lengthened refractory
period. correlative structural and functional alterations in the
ageing penis consist of endothelial dysfunction, upregulation
of corporal smooth muscle tone, diminished quantity of
cavernosal smooth muscle and elastic fibers, and increased in
cavernosal fibrosis [16-18].
frequently, diabetic and elderly patients with ed are
more resistant to pde5 inhibitors, most probably not because
of secondary contributions from neurologic or vascular changes.
a major limiting factor for pde5 inhibitors working effectively

is a minimum or ‘critical’ amount of no. this observation
has been made in clinical studies involving both sildenafil
(viagra) and vardenafil (levitra) [19].
4.

pde5 enzyme

the pde5 enzyme belongs to a protein superfamily of cyclic
nucleotide pdes that can be subdivided into at least 11 families
of structurally and functionally related enzymes. pde5 directs
most of its cgmp hydrolytic activity to the corpora cavernosa
smooth muscle. the three pde5 isoforms identified in human
penile tissue are spliced variants with identical sites of action [20].
pde5a1 and pde5a2 are identical to pde5s previously
isolated from non-penile tissue. in vitro, the novel isoform
pde5a3 is confined to tissues with smooth muscle or cardiac
muscle composition [21].
pde5 has two highly homologous domains at its n-terminal
end. these domains have been termed gafa and gafb,
based on their sequence homology to similar motifs, one of
which is the binding site for cgmp (figure 2) [22]. the
gafa/cgmp binding sites of pde5 were determined as necessary for enhancement of ser92 (bovine pde5) phosphorylation
by camp-dependent or cgmp-dependent protein kinase
(pka/pkg) in vitro [23]. rybalkin et al. [24] suggest that
occupancy of the gafa site by cgmp is mandated for
maximal activity of the holoenzyme and may be required for
any appreciable activity.
4.1

pde5 enzyme inhibition

selective inhibition of pde5 promotes the erectile response
to sexual stimulation. pde5 inhibition is widely accepted as
an efficacious option for the treatment of ed, as witnessed by
extensive clinical experience with sildenafil and other new pde5
inhibitors. pde5 inhibitors compete with the substrate cgmp
for binding to its catalytic site (figure 2) [25-28].
4.2

pde5 inhibitors

first-line oral therapy for ed includes sildenafil, vardenafil and
tadalafil (figure 3) [29]. sildenafil was the first commercially

available pde5 inhibitor, and several worldwide clinical trials
have established its efficacy and safety in the treatment
of ed [30]. it improved erectile function in 50 – 80% of
ed patients with a broad range of etiologies. lower response
rates were observed in dm patients (type 1, 59%; type 2,
64%) [31]. the first two us trials of sildenafil use in men
with type 1 and type 2 dm documented 51 – 56% response
for sildenafil-treated men compared with 10 – 12% of those
treated with placebo [32]. stuckey et al. [33] presented results in
188 type 1 dm patients with concomitant ed. improvements
in mean scores from baseline to end of treatment were significant in patients who received sildenafil, using international
index of erectile function (iief) questions 3 (35.7% vs
19.9%) and 4 (68.4% vs 26.5%) (ability to attain and
maintain an erection, respectively). in a study of 110 men
with type 2 diabetes at 12-week follow-up, questions 3 and 4
of the iief showed similar significant benefit. however, efficacy
of sildenafil was also correlated with glycated hemoglobin
concentrations and number of diabetic complications [31].
vardenafil treatment resulted in a return to normal ef
(ef domain score ≥ 26) with treatment [34]. in a double-blind,
placebo-controlled, multicenter study that evaluated vardenafil’s
efficacy and safety in more than 450 patients with dm, mostly
type 2, and mild to severe ed, vardenafil showed significant
improvement in erections in 57% of patients treated with a
10 mg dose and in 72% treated with a 20 mg dose, compared
with 13% of those treated with placebo [35].
858

tadalafil is a long-acting pde5 inhibitor more recently
approved in europe and the united states. after oral administration of a 20 mg dose, tadalafil is readily absorbed, with
median tmax = 2.0 h within a range of 0.5 – 12.0 h [36]. in
a large spanish multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, parallel-group phase iii study, 216 type 1 and
type 2 diabetic patients were enrolled. patients had a low
mean baseline iief ef value of 12.2 and a mean age of
55.7, and 93.1% had ed for more than 1 year [37]. the
majority (> 72%) had moderate to severe ed. treatment with
tadalafil  xxxd1891xxx  and 20 mg improved symptoms of ed regardless
of type of dm and degree of glucose control, as measured
by serum glycosylated hemoglobin (hba1c) levels.
fonseca et al. [38] examined the effect of tadalafil
in 637 dm patients in an integrated analysis of 12 phase iii
trials. the magnitude of tadalafil-mediated improvements
for 10 and 20 mg doses at end points were similar to those
observed in the spanish diabetic study and the general
ed population [37]. after 12 weeks of treatment, tadalafil
20 mg improved the percentage of successful erections,
intercourse rate, and overall sexual satisfaction compared
with placebo [38]. it is of note that clearance rates of tadalafil
are not significantly reduced in elderly men aged more than
65 years or in those with diabetes mellitus [39].
basic investigation continues in our understanding of
substrate selectivity for pde5 inhibitors that compete with the
substrate cgmp for the enzymatic catalytic site. sildenafil

and vardenafil differ in the substituent (methyl/ethyl) of the
piperazine side chain (figure 3). although there are only two
structural differences, vardenafil’s in vitro potency is more
than 20 times greater than that of sildenafil for inhibiting
purified pde5 [40].
according to us and european labeling information,
the recommended starting dose for sildenafil is 50 mg, and
for both vardenafil and tadalafil 10 mg. for sildenafil
and vardenafil, medication should be taken approximately 1 h
(tadalafil 2 h) before sexual activity.
overall, treatment of ed with pde5 inhibitors is well
tolerated and the side-effect profiles of all three drugs are
similar. all are likely to be related either directly or indirectly
to the primary action of the drugs as pde5 inhibitors [41].
a major impediment in developing more effective therapies
is the lack of exclusive selectivity towards pde5, in addition
to dose-limiting side effects such as headache, flushing, nonspecific gastrointestinal problems, rhinitis, and abnormalities
in color vision [42]. one of the challenges in developing
pde5-specific inhibitors for therapeutic purposes is the
similarity in the catalytic sites of pde5 and pde6 with respect

to drug binding. among the cgmp-specific pdes, pde6 is
structurally most similar to pde5: they share > 40% of their
catalytic domain. this accounts for the well-documented
side effect of a transient disturbance in visual function
with sildenafil [43].
5. can pde5 inhibitors enhance bioavailability
of no in diabetes and ageing with oxidative
stress?

according to the previously referenced clinical studies, pde
inhibitors increase the bioavailability of no by preventing
formation of ros in diabetic and elderly ed patients. in
preclinical studies, the potent pde5 inhibitor  xxxd3464xxx 
( xxxd3464xxx ) increased no levels by enhancing its bioavailability
(figure 4) [44]. the endothelium and smooth muscle
identified by computerized image analysis were significantly
decreased in the diabetic group and  xxxd3464xxx  counteracted
this detrimental change [44].
a principal intravascular source of o2- is nadph oxidase
(nox) [45]. there are many etiologies contributing to ed in

novel phosphodiesterase-5 (pde5) inhibitors in the alleviation of erectile dysfunction due to diabetes and ageing-induced
oxidative stress

diabetes and ageing, such as the expression of nox, caused
by thromboxane a2, cytokines,  xxxg99xxx , hypoxia and
o2- itself [46]. indeed, sildenafil inhibits the activity and
expression of nox in smooth muscle cells through a cgmppkg-mediated mechanism, characterizing the possibly central
role of nox in ed development [45]. one study in diabetic
rats reported that administration of sildenafil with  xxxd3521xxx ,
an antioxidant, improved ef [11]. other studies have revealed
that administration of a nox inhibitor, apocynin, in dm
models prevents impairment of no-mediated relaxation of
vascular and penile smooth muscle [47]. koupparis et al. [45]
assessed the effect of sildenafil on superoxide formation and
 xxxg1508xxx  (the active subunit of nadph oxidase) expression
in cultured corpus cavernosa smooth muscle cells. the beneficial
effect demostratedis mediated through the inhibition of pde5,
which in turn augments the inhibitory action of the nocgmp axis on nadph oxidase expression and activity. both
sildenafil citrate and sildenafil nitrate (ncx 911) are indicated
in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome through
suppression of nadph oxidase expression, o2-· formation, and
preservation of no bioavailability [48]. oxidative stress due
to ischemia/reperfusion (i/r) is recognized as a trigger in
the initiation of a variety of pathophysiological conditions.
similarly, vardenafil provides significant cardioprotective
effects against i/r injury [49].
6.

new-generation pde5 inhibitors

other pde5 inhibitors are in earlier stages of clinical
development, and according to recent publications several
companies have ongoing preclinical discovery programs.
the new generation of pde5 inhibitors, such as  xxxd250xxx ,
 xxxd3464xxx , slx-2101, and mirodenafil, promises improved
benefits for patients with ed (figure 4). the pyrimidine
derivative  xxxd250xxx  ( xxxd250xxx , vivus, inc.) is a highly selective
inhibitor of pde5 [50]. this agent exhibits rapid absorption
(tmax = ∼ 35 min) and a short half-life of < 1.5 h [51]. the
most common side effect with  xxxd250xxx  was headache; however,
there was no registered effect on blood pressure or heart rate
when administered 12 h before nitroglycerin. thus, this may
be a good pde5 inhibitor for patients who use nitrates [52].
 xxxd250xxx , with its rapid absorption and short half-life, is the
fastest-acting pde5 inhibitor.
 xxxd3464xxx  is currently available in south korea, where it was
approved at the end of 2005 ( xxxd3464xxx ,  xxxd3464xxx ®, dong-a
pharma tech. co. ltd). it has a half-life of 11 – 13 h and
relatively rapid absorption (tmax = 1 – 1.5 h) [53]. in addition,
no serious adverse events related to  xxxd3464xxx  have been
reported [52]. kim et al. [54] reported that chronic administration
of  xxxd3464xxx  could attenuate the development of ed in diabetes,
and it has been hypothesized that  xxxd3464xxx  could have benefits
on endothelial function. in a recent study there was no
difference in improvement in iief-ef domain score
change related to the level of glycemic control (hba1c
levels). advantages of  xxxd3464xxx  include a long period of activity,
860

rapid absorption, and mild adverse effects limited to
flushing and headache.
slx-2101 (surface logic, inc.) exhibits excellent potency
in experiments, both ex vivo and in vivo. this drug has a
long-lasting duration of inhibition of pde5, at least 36 – 48 h
at all doses studied. single doses of slx-2101 exhibited safety
and tolerability in healthy volunteers and it is a candidate
for once-daily dosing [55]. slx-2101 exhibited enhanced
potency in preclinical molecular and cellular rat model studies,
lasting longer than 24 h [56]. slx-2101’s metabolite m1 extends
its activity, and therefore clinically it may provide an even
longer period of benefit in ed patients.
mirodenafil (sk3530, sk chemicals co. ltd) is available
in korea and was approved at the end of 2007 as m-vix®.
in men with ed, the mean changes in iief-ef domain
scores from baseline were significantly improved compared
to placebo. the general assessment questionnaire ( xxxg923xxx )
indicated that up to 86.2% of men with ed using the
100 mg dose reported improved erections [57]. flushing
and headache were mostly mild and well-tolerated side
effects of mirodenafil.
numerous pde5-inhibiting drugs have been investigated
in recent preclinical studies. fr226807, a nitrobenzamide
derivative, inhibited pde5 isolated from human platelets
with an ic50 value of 1.1 nm (figure 5) [58]. fr226807
also inhibited pde6 with an ic50 of 20 nm. the ic50
value for pde6 was 18 times higher than that for pde5.
this compound is a weak (ic50 = 5 µm) inhibitor of
pdes 1 to 4. the disadvantage of this drug is that the
nitroaromatic fragment can be metabolically transformed to
generate potentially toxic species, such as nitroso and
hydroxylamine derivatives.
an isoquinoline derivative, methyl-2-(4-aminophenyl)1,2-dihydro-1-oxo-7-(2-pyridinylmethoxy)-4-(3,4,5trimethoxyphenyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxylate sulfate (t-1032),
is a novel potent inhibitor of cgmp-binding cgmp-specific
pde5 (figure 5) [59]. t-1032 (tanabe pharmaceutical) is a
potent (ic50 = 1.0 nm) and selective pde5 inhibitor, with
ic50 values > 3 µm against pdes 1 to 4 and ic50 = 28 nm
for pde6. t-1032 increased the concentration of cgmp in
a dose-dependent manner in rat vascular smooth muscle
cells over a concentration range of 1 – 100 nm.
the effects of 3-ethyl-8-[2-(4-hydroxymethylpiperidino)
benzylamino]-2,3-dihydro-1h-imidazo(4,5-g)quinazoline2-thione dihydrochloride (kf31327) on pde5 activity and
platelet aggregation were investigated and compared with
those of sildenafil (figure 5) [60]. unlike other known pde5
inhibitors, kf31327 binds in a non-competitive manner
with cgmp [61]. uk369003, a second-generation pde5
inhibitor, is now in phase ii trials for ed. jnj-10280205
and jnj-10287069 are other suitable agents for clinical
trials in men with ed [62].
sildenafil nitrate (ncx 911) and sildenafil citrate have
similar selectivity and potency with respect to inhibiting
pde5. however, unlike sildenafil, ncx 911 can release

both activating soluble  xxxg1587xxx  and inhibiting
pde5. furthermore, ncx 911 has been demonstrated to treat
acute respiratory distress syndrome through suppression of
nadph oxidase expression and therefore of superoxide
formation and preservation of no bioavailability [48].
in a hypercholesterolemic rabbit model, ncx 911 was
shown to be 5 − 10 times more potent than sildenafil
in reducing phenylephrine-induced tone in cavernosal
smooth muscle [63].

expert opinion

the pde5 inhibitors reviewed herein exhibit different pde
selectivity profiles, in particular in their relative affinities for
pde5, pde6 and pde11. novel pde5 inhibitors in phase ii
and iii studies include  xxxd250xxx  (intranasal administration

with a fast onset of action),  xxxd3464xxx  (long-lasting for up to
24 h and also with a rapid onset), slx-2101 (long-lasting
for up to 48 h with conversion to an active metabolite) and
mirodenafil (similar pharmacokinetic profile to sildenafil
and vardenafil). currently, clinical data for these four drugs
show no significant differences in terms of efficacy. future
studies are needed with these four novel pde5 inhibitors,
including large preclinical and clinical efficacy and
tolerability observations, especially in diabetic and elderly
populations. it is hoped that use of drugs with differing
pharmacological profiles may lead to better sexual responses
in diabetic and aged men with ed. in addition, new
insights into these novel pde5 inhibitors need to be
based on o2-· generation in diabetes and ageing and
pde selectivity profiles. effects of o2-,  xxxg2431xxx ,
and age need to be further investigated in relation to
pde5 enzyme activity. with increased knowledge and

effect of pde5 inhibition combined
with free oxygen radical scavenger therapy
on erectile function in a diabetic animal
model. int j impot res 2003;15:347-54
this research demonstrated that an
antioxidant drug ( xxxd3521xxx ) enhanced
the therapeutic effect of the pde5
inhibitor (sildenafil) in a diabetic model.
it also highlighted the need for
well-designed clinical trials in men
who remain poorly responsive to current
pde5 inhibition therapy and proposed
utility of antioxidants as a new strategy
for treatment.
