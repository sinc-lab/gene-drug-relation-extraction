 xxxg1618xxx  (nt) is a 13-amino acid peptide that exerts
neuromodulatory functions in the central nervous system
and endocrine/paracrine actions in the periphery (vincent,
1995; rostene et al., 1997). three nt receptors, termed
ntr1,  xxxg1619xxx  and ntr3 according to the order in which they
were cloned, have been identified so far (tanaka et al., 1990;
vita et al., 1993, 1998; chalon et al., 1996; mazella et al.,
1996, 1998; vincent et al., 1999). the ntr1 and  xxxg1619xxx  are g
protein-coupled receptors and share 60% homology, whereas
the ntr3 belongs to an entirely different family of proteins.
in the past 25 years, a wealth of information has accumulated regarding the pharmacological and biological properties of the ntr1 (vincent et al., 1999). our understanding of
the physiology of the ntr1 has been facilitated in the last 10
years by the development of sr 48692, a nonpeptide antagonist that binds preferentially to the ntr1 (gully et al.,
1993; rostene et al., 1997). much less is known about the

ntr1, stimulated ip production, whereas  xxxd2469xxx , a nonpeptide histamine h1 antagonist that binds the  xxxg1619xxx  but not
the ntr1, behaved as a weak partial  xxxd1422xxx . nt analogs modified at position 11 of the nt molecule, in particular by
the introduction of bulky aromatic d amino acids, exhibited
binding selectivity at the hntr2 and also behaved as partial
inverse agonists, reversing constitutive ip production up to
50%. finally, nt barely affected constitutive ip production but
antagonized the effects of both agonist and  xxxd1422xxx 
compounds, thus behaving as a neutral antagonist. the unique
pharmacological profile of the hntr2 is discussed in the light of
its sequence similarity with the ntr1 and the known binding
site topology of nt and sr 48692 in the ntr1.

biological role of the  xxxg1619xxx , and the functions associated with
nt binding to the ntr3 remain unknown.
the  xxxg1619xxx  is identical to the low-affinity nt binding sites
(kd in the nanomolar range) first described in rat brain
(mazella et al., 1983) and has been shown to be selectively
recognized by  xxxd2469xxx , a nonpeptide h1 histamine antagonist, in contrast to the high-affinity nt binding sites (kd
in the 100 pm range) that are totally insensitive to  xxxd2469xxx  and have been identified as the ntr1 (schotte et al.,
1986; kitabgi et al., 1987). it was subsequently reported that
the ontogeny and localization of the ntr1 and  xxxg1619xxx  in rat
brain differ markedly and that although the ntr1 is almost
exclusively neuronal, the  xxxg1619xxx  seems to be associated both
with neurons and glial cells (schotte and laduron, 1987;
schotte et al., 1988; mazella et al., 1996; nouel et al., 1997,
1999). recently, using antisense strategy in vivo to decrease
the expression of the  xxxg1619xxx  in the mouse brain, we presented
evidence that this receptor is responsible for the sr 48692insensitive analgesic effect of centrally administered nt (dubuc et al., 1994; dubuc et al., 1999).
the  xxxg1619xxx  has been cloned from the rat, mouse, and hu-

abstract
two g protein-coupled  xxxg1618xxx  (nt) receptors, termed
ntr1 and  xxxg1619xxx , have been identified so far. in contrast to the
ntr1, which has been extensively studied, little is known about
the pharmacological and biological properties of the  xxxg1619xxx . in
the course of characterizing nt analogs that exhibited binding
selectivity for the  xxxg1619xxx , we discovered that this receptor constitutively activated inositol phosphate (ip) production. here,
we report on the constitutive activity of the human  xxxg1619xxx 
(hntr2) transfected in cos cells and on compounds that exhibit agonism, inverse agonism, and neutral antagonism at this
receptor. ip levels increased linearly with time, whereas they
remained constant in mock-transfected cells. furthermore, ip
production was proportional to the amount of hntr2 present at
the cell membrane. sr 48692, a nonpeptide antagonist of the

materials and methods
drugs.  xxxg1618xxx  was from neosystem (strasbourg, france)
and sr 48692 was from sanofi recherche (montpellier, france).
monoiodo-[125i-tyr3] xxxg1618xxx  (2000 ci/mmol) (125i-nt) was prepared as described previously (bidard et al., 1993).  xxxd2469xxx 
was from janssen pharmaceutica (beerse, belgium). nt analogs
were synthesized according to the method of doulut et al. (1992).
table 1 lists the structures and abbreviations of the pseudopeptide
and peptide nt analogs used in the present study.
cell culture and transfection. cos m6 cells were grown in
dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (invitrogen, cergy-pontoise,
france) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (dutcher, brumath,
france) and 50 ␮g/ml gentamicin (sigma, st quentin fallavier,
france). for transient transfection, 100-mm cell culture dishes,

seeded with 106 cells the day before, were washed twice with trisbuffered saline (25 mm tris, 137 mm nacl, 2.3 mm cacl2, 0.5 mm
mgcl2, 0.4 mm na2hpo4, ph 7.4) and incubated for 30 min with 1
␮g of recombinant hntr2-pcdna3 or hntr1-pcdna3 plasmid in
the presence of deae dextran (0.5 mg/ml; sigma) at room temperature. after 3 h in culture medium supplemented with 100 ␮m
chloroquine (sigma), cells were washed twice with tris-buffered
saline, and cultured for 48 to 72 h. for inositol phosphate measurement as a function of hntr2 expression, several transient transfections were performed with increasing recombinant plasmid amounts
ranging from 10 ng to 5 ␮g per 100-mm cell culture dish.
cell membranes preparation. 48 h after transfection, cells
were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and collected in
ice-cold 5 mm tris/hcl, ph 8. after homogenization by repeated
passages through a syringe needle and centrifugation at 4°c for 30
min at 100,000g, cell membranes were resuspended in 300 ␮l per
dish of 5 mm tris/hcl, ph 7.5, and stored at ⫺20°c. membrane
protein concentration was determined with the use of the bio-rad
protein assay (bio-rad, ivry sur seine, france).
binding experiments. binding experiments with 125i-nt were
carried out with 20 ␮g of cell membrane proteins in a final volume of
250 ␮l of 50 mm tris/hcl, ph 7.5, containing 0.1% bovine serum
albumin and 0.8 mm 1,10-orthophenantroline (sigma), for 30 min at
room temperature. the reaction was stopped by addition of 2 ml of
ice-cold buffer and filtration on cellulose acetate filter (0.2 ␮m; sartorius, bohemia, ny), followed by two washes of the tube and filter
with 2 ml of the same buffer. nonspecific binding was determined in
the presence of 1 ␮m unlabeled ligand. saturation and competition
experiments with membranes from hnt2-expressing cells were performed essentially as described previously (martin et al., 1999).
briefly, competition experiments were carried out with 0.1 nm
125
i-nt and increasing concentrations of unlabeled compounds. saturation experiments were performed by incubating increasing concentrations of 125i-nt ranging from 0.05 nm to 0.8 nm and then by
adding increasing concentrations of unlabeled nt (0.5 to 20 nm) to a
fixed concentration of 0.4 nm 125i-nt. we have previously shown
that iodination of nt on the tyr3 position yields a peptide with the
same binding affinity as unlabeled nt (sadoul et al., 1984). competition experiments with the hntr1 were performed similarly with
0.05 nm 125i-nt and 2 ␮g of membrane protein (labbé-jullié et al.,
1998). data were analyzed with the use of the ligand software
(munson and rodbard, 1980).
inositol phosphate determination. twenty-four hours after
transfection, cells were trypsinized and grown for 18 h in 12-well
plates in culture medium in the presence of 0.5 ␮ci of myo-[3h]inositol (icn biomedicals, orsay, france). after 2 washes with earle’s
buffer (25 mm hepes, 25 mm tris, 140 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 1.8
mm cacl2, 0.9 mm mgcl2, and 5 mm glucose containing 0.1% bovine
 xxxg124xxx ), cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°c in 500 ␮l of
earle’s buffer containing 20 mm licl in the absence or presence of
the different drugs used in the present study at the indicated con-

man (chalon et al., 1996; mazella et al., 1996; vita et al.,
1998). when expressed in mammalian cell lines or in xenopus laevis oocytes, this receptor exhibits a complex pharmacological behavior that seems to be species-dependent. thus,
in x. laevis oocytes that expressed the mntr2, nt and
 xxxd2469xxx  acted as agonists on chloride conductance and
sr 48692 was without agonist or antagonist effects in this
system (mazella et al., 1996; botto et al., 1997). in rntr2expressing chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells, sr 48692
and  xxxd2469xxx  efficiently activated ca2⫹ mobilization,
whereas nt had little effect on the ca2⫹ response (yamada
et al., 1998). finally, in hntr2-expressing cho cells, sr
48692 activated ca2⫹ mobilization whereas both nt and
 xxxd2469xxx  antagonized this response (vita et al., 1998).
these findings suggested that as-yet-unidentified endogenous ligands of the  xxxg1619xxx  may exist (vita et al., 1998).
recently, we described nt analogs modified on the tyrosyl
residue at position 11 of the nt molecule that exhibited 10to 100-fold higher affinity for the mntr2 than for the rntr1
(dubuc et al., 1999). while comparing the binding and biological potencies of these compounds at the hntr2 versus
the hntr1, we discovered that the hntr2 exhibited spontaneous phosphoinositide hydrolyzing activity when transfected in cos cells. here we describe the constitutive activity
of the hntr2 transfected in cos cells on inositol phosphate
(ip) production. furthermore, we show that sr 48692 acts as
an agonist at the hntr2 whereas the above-mentioned nt
analogs and other analogs also modified on tyr11 exhibit
partial  xxxd1422xxx  activity. finally, we show that nt
behaves as a neutral antagonist, reversing the effects of
either agonist or inverse agonists and having no effect by
itself.

and 300 ng of plasmid and reached a plateau thereafter. fluorescence intensity distribution in the transfected cell population showed
a single mode with a peak whose intensity increased approximately
3-fold between 10 ng and 3 ␮g of plasmid. the fluorescence distribution was nearly symmetrical, declining sharply and then trailing
somewhat on the low fluorescence intensity side and declining
sharply on the high intensity side. whatever the amount of plasmid
used, no cell had a fluorescence signal that exceeded four times mean
fluorescence intensity (data not shown).

results
the hntr2 exhibits constitutive activity. cos cells
were either mock-transfected or transfected with the hntr2
and ip production was measured as a function of time in the
presence of li⫹ (fig. 1a). ip production did not vary significantly over a 30-min interval in mock-transfected cells and
remained similar to ip levels measured in the absence of li⫹
(fig. 1a). in contrast, ip production rose linearly with time in
cells expressing the hntr2, increasing 5-fold over that measured in mock-transfected cells after a 30-min incubation. in
a second series of experiments, cos cells were transfected
with varying amounts of hntr2-encoding plasmid. the
amount of expressed hntr2 was measured in binding experiments with 125i-nt and membranes prepared from each
batch of cells, and ip production was determined after a
30-min incubation in intact cells. in these experiments, the
relationship between receptor expression and plasmid
amount was not linear. there was an increase of approximately 10-fold in hntr2 expression (as determined in binding experiments) when plasmid concentration rose from 30
ng to 3 ␮g per dish. above 3 ␮g, receptor expression reached
a plateau. furthermore, bmax values varied somewhat between sets of transfection experiments performed with different plasmid preparations. for these reasons, experiments
were grouped according to bmax values rather than to the
amount of plasmid used to transfect the cells. this explains
the horizontal standard deviations in fig. 1b. ip production
was proportional to the amount of expressed hntr2 in cos
cells and was increased nearly 10-fold at the highest level of
receptor expression tested in these experiments (fig. 1b).
furthermore, ip levels measured after a 30-min incubation
in the absence of li⫹ remained low and barely varied as
receptor expression increased. finally, for comparison, ip
production was measured in the presence or absence of li⫹ in
cos cells transfected with the hntr1. the cells expressed
3.7 ⫾ 0.3 pmol of hntr1/mg of membrane protein as determined in binding experiments (i.e., a receptor concentration
that was four times higher than the highest hntr2 concentration tested). figure 1b shows that there was no measurable increase in ip levels in hntr1-transfected cells. altogether, these data clearly demonstrate the constitutive
activity of the hntr2.

centrations. for ip measurement as a function of time, cells were
incubated in licl-earle buffer for varying times ranging from 0 to 30
min. the reaction was stopped by 800 ␮l of ice-cold 10 mm  xxxd2154xxx .
after 1 h at 4°c, the supernatant was collected and neutralized by
2.5 ml of 5 mm nh4oh. total [3h]inositol phosphates were separated from free [3h]inositol on dowex  xxxg2361xxx -x8 (bio-rad) chromatography by eluting successively with 5 ml of water and 4 ml of 40 mm
and 1 m ammonium formate buffer, ph 5.5. the radioactivity contained in the 1 m fraction was counted after addition of 5 ml of
ecolume (icn biomedicals). in all experiments, control ip measurements were performed after a 30 min incubation in earle buffer
without licl. except in fig. 1, where total ip production is represented, ip production in the absence of licl was subtracted from
total ip levels measured in the presence of licl and the data are
expressed as the percentage of basal (constitutive) ip production in
the absence of added drugs. in experiments designed to measure ip
production as a function of hntr2 expression levels, 24 h after
transfection with varying amounts of plasmid, cells in 100 mm culture dishes were either left in culture medium for another 24 h and
harvested for binding assay (see preceding section) or treated as
described above for ip measurement.

ranging from 10 ng to 3 ␮g were transfected in cos cells using the
same procedure as that used for transfecting the hntr2-pcdna3
plasmid. forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were trypsinized,
centrifuged, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine  xxxg124xxx . transfection efficiency was analyzed by flow cytometry on a facscan flow cytometer (bd biosciences sa, pont de claix, france). the data show that the

for all analogs. thus, the selective analogs can be defined as
partial inverse agonists at the hntr2. three of the four
analogs had bulky d-amino acid residues ( xxxd1794xxx  or d-nal) in
position 11 of the nt molecule. for comparison, two isomer
analogs of jmv 457 and jmv 509 with  xxxd3454xxx  and l-nal in
position 11 (jmv 458 and jmv 510, respectively) were tested
in binding and biological assays. they showed no selectivity
for the hntr2 over the hntr1 (table 1) and did not affect
constitutive ip production at concentrations as high as 10

activity (fig. 2). ic50 and emax values for the  xxxd2469xxx 
effect are shown in table 2. maximal inhibition of basal ip
levels reached 30%. hence,  xxxd2469xxx  behaved as a partial  xxxd1422xxx  of the hntr2.
 xxxg1618xxx  analogs that behave as inverse agonists at the hntr2. we have noted previously that some
nt analogs modified on position 11 of the nt sequence
showed selectivity for the mntr2 compared with the rntr1
(dubuc et al., 1999). here we show that four such analogs
also presented selectivity for the hntr2 versus the hntr1.
thus, the compounds competed for 125i-nt binding with
potencies that were 10 to 50 times greater at the hntr2 than
at the hntr1 in contrast to nt, which showed higher binding potency for the hntr1 than for the hntr2 (fig. 3a,
table 1). interestingly, when tested for their ability to affect
ip production in intact hntr2-expressing cos cells, all the
selective nt analogs inhibited constitutive ip production in a
concentration dependent manner (fig. 3 b). ic50 and emax
values for ip production inhibition are given in table 2. in
general, ic50 values for inhibiting ip production matched ki
values for competing with 125i-nt binding (less than a 4-fold
difference at the most), except for jmv 2004, the ic50 value
of which was 15-fold higher than its ki value (tables 1 and 2).
jmv 2004 is the only analog in this series that is not protected at its n terminus (table 1). we have previously shown
that such nt analogs are degraded by aminopeptidases when
exposed to cells or tissues at 37°c (lugrin et al., 1991). ip
measurements were performed at 37°c, whereas binding
assays were carried out at room temperature in the presence
of the metallopeptidase inhibitor phenanthroline. these different conditions might have led to greater degradation of
jmv 2004 in the bioassay than in the binding assay. this
hypothesis was tested directly by comparing the effects of
jmv 2004 on ip production in the absence or presence of 10
␮m  xxxd3463xxx , an aminopeptidase inhibitor. in the presence of
 xxxd3463xxx , there was a 4- to 5-fold reduction in ic50 values for
the ability of the analog to inhibit ip production (790 ⫾ 160
nm and 170 ⫾ 50 nm, n ⫽ 3, in the absence and presence of
 xxxd3463xxx , respectively), with no change in emax value (presented as the percentage of inhibition of constitutive activity:
39 ⫾ 3.7 and 37 ⫾ 4.2, n ⫽ 3, in the absence and presence of
 xxxd3463xxx , respectively). maximal inhibition reached 30 to 50%

discussion
the major finding of the present study is that the hntr2,
when expressed transiently in cos cells, exhibits a robust
constitutive activity on ip production. spontaneous activity
of native gpcrs in the absence of agonists with respect to g
protein activation, either in membrane or in reconstituted
systems, has long been known (cerione et al., 1984; costa
and herz, 1989; freissmuth et al., 1991). the first described
constitutively active g protein-coupled receptor obtained by
mutation was the ␣1-adrenergic receptor (cotecchia et al.,
1990). since then, a great number of constitutively active
gpcrs for neurotransmitter, neuropeptides, and hormones
have been engineered by mutagenesis (reviewed in milligan
et al., 1997; leurs et al., 1998) and a growing number of
native gpcrs with constitutive activity have been identified

fig. 4. neutral antagonism of  xxxg1618xxx  on ip production. effect of
increasing concentrations of nt on ip production stimulated by 1 ␮m sr
48692 (a) or inhibited by 10 ␮m jmv 457 (b) in hntr2-expressing cells.
ip levels measured in the absence of li⫹ were subtracted from the data
that are expressed as the percentage of ip production without added
drugs (1170 ⫾ 110 dpm/3 ⫻ 105 cells). values are the means ⫾ s.e. from
three independent experiments.

(reviewed in de ligt et al., 2000). the hntr2 joins the latter
group.
the pharmacological properties of the hntr2 have been
characterized by others in cho cells stably transfected with
this receptor (vita et al., 1998). coupling of the hntr2 to ip
formation was described and it was reported that sr 48692
behaved as an agonist at the hntr2, whereas nt antagonized sr 48692 (vita et al., 1998). similar findings were
made here for the hntr2 transiently expressed in cos cells.
however, contrary to our observation, the hntr2 was not
reported to be constitutively active in cho cells (vita et al.,
1998). the reasons for this discrepancy are not clear. coupling of the receptor in both systems activates the same
transduction pathway (i.e., stimulation of phospholipase c).
furthermore, the present data show that constitutive activity of the hntr2 in cos cells could be detected at low
concentrations of receptor (100 fmol/mg of membrane protein) well below the amount of receptor (0.5–1 pmol/mg)
expressed at the membrane of stably transfected cho cells
(vita et al., 1998). it could be argued that transient transfection results in heterogeneous protein expression. this point
was assessed by transient transfection of a gfp-pcdna3
plasmid and fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis in
cos cells (see materials and methods). if the data obtained
with gfp-pcdna3- can be extrapolated to hntr2-pcdna3transfected cells, it can be estimated that when mean receptor expression level is 100 fmol/mg, no cell should express
greater than 400 fmol/mg of receptor, a value that remains
below hntr2 concentrations in stably transfected cho cells.
hence, hntr2 expression in cho cells would seem sufficient
to detect constitutive activity in this system. along the same
lines, it might be interesting to compare  xxxg1619xxx  concentrations in our system with those found in normal tissues that
express the receptor.  xxxg1619xxx  concentrations are 100 to 150
fmol/mg and 150 fmol/mg in membranes prepared from
whole adult rat brain and primary cultures of rat cortical
astrocytes, respectively (kitabgi et al., 1987; nouel et al.,
1999). furthermore, the  xxxg1619xxx  distribution in these systems
is heterogeneous, being predominantly glial in the brain and
concerning a subpopulation representing only 30 to 40% of
primary cultured astrocytes (nouel et al., 1999). therefore,
the concentrations of  xxxg1619xxx  in rat brain are clearly within the
range of those achieved in cos cells and might therefore be
compatible with the expression of constitutive activity in
vivo. it will now be necessary to establish whether constitutive activation of the  xxxg1619xxx  is dependent on the cell system
used to express the receptor and whether it is species-dependent and observable in cells and tissues that normally express the receptor.
we have reported previously that some nt analogs modified at position 11 of the nt molecule, in particular jmv 431
and jmv 509, had higher affinity for the mntr2 than for the
rntr1 (dubuc et al., 1999). here, we show this to be true for
the hntr2 versus the hntr1. in addition, two other analogs, jmv 457 and jmv 2004, were found to share the same
property. interestingly, when tested for their ability to affect
ip production in hntr2-expressing cos cells, all the compounds partially inhibited (30 to 50%) the spontaneous activity of the receptor. hence, the analogs can be defined as
partial inverse agonists at the hntr2. such a behavior
seems to be related in part to the introduction of a bulky
aromatic d-amino acid in position 11, because analogs that

hntr2 that nt concentration dependently reversed the effect of 1 ␮m sr 48692 on ip production back to the constitutive activity of unstimulated cells with an ic50 value of
130 ⫾ 25 nm (fig. 4 a). we also tested the effect of nt on the
inhibitory response of inverse agonists. jmv 457 was chosen
in these studies because it is the most efficient of the inverse
agonists. figure 4b shows that nt antagonized the effect of
10 ␮m jmv 457 in a concentration-dependent manner with
an ic50 value of 1760 ⫾ 150 nm, bringing ip production back
to the levels of constitutive activity. hence, although nt has
no effect by itself on the hntr2, it is able to antagonize
agonist and  xxxd1422xxx  effects and can therefore be defined as a neutral antagonist at this receptor. from these
data, one can estimate ki values for the ability of nt to
reverse the effects of sr 48692 and jmv 457 by using the
cheng and prusoff (1973) relationship (craig, 1993), ki ⫽
ic50 / (1 ⫹ a/ec50), in which a represents the fixed concentration of sr 48692 (1 ␮m) or jmv 457 (10 ␮m) used in the
experiments and ec50 the half-maximally effective concentration of sr 48692 (50 nm, fig. 2) or jmv 457 (444 nm,
table 2) on ip production. calculation yielded ki values of 6.2
and 75 nm for the ability of nt to antagonize the effects of sr
48692 and jmv 457, respectively. note that these values are
4- to 50-fold higher than the kd value of nt for binding to the
hntr2.

constitutive activity of the human  xxxg1618xxx  receptor 2

and nt binding are conserved in the hntr1 and the hntr2.
furthermore, the exceptions concern phenylalanyl residues
in the rntr1 that are substituted by tyrosyl residues in the
hntr1 or hntr2. this suggests that the binding sites for sr
48692 and nt are similar in both the ntr1 and  xxxg1619xxx  and,
therefore, that the opposite pharmacological behaviors of sr
48692 and nt on the two receptors are not the consequence
of differences in ligand binding domains.
in general, ntr1 and  xxxg1619xxx  sequences are highly conserved in transmembrane domains and extracellular loops
(vincent et al., 1999). in contrast, they are poorly conserved
in the n-terminal domain and intracellular loops. in particular, the third intracellular loop of both receptors shows
virtually no similarity, being much longer in the  xxxg1619xxx  (⬃ 50
residues) than in the ntr1 (⬃ 30 residues) and sharing only
five identical residues. this loop has been shown to be involved in coupling the ntr1 to gq (yamada et al., 1994). it
is therefore quite possible that the constitutive activation of
phospholipase c by the  xxxg1619xxx  might result from the divergent structure of the third intracellular loop in both receptors. the loop in the hntr2 would activate the g protein in
the absence of ligand. it might also modify the relative orientation of connecting tm6, e3, and tm7 in such a way that
sr 48692 and nt binding results in the inverse pharmacological profiles of the ligands observed in the hntr2 compared with the ntr1. these hypotheses could be tested
directly by swapping the third intracellular loop of each nt
receptor subtype and testing the pharmacological response of
the chimeric receptors to sr 48692 and nt.
the previous observation by others that sr 48692 was
agonist and antagonized by nt in hntr2-expressing cells
led to the interesting suggestion that there might be an
undiscovered endogenous agonist of the  xxxg1619xxx  (vita et al.,
1998). the present finding that the hntr2 exhibits constitutive activity and that nt analogs can behave as inverse
agonists at this receptor raises the intriguing possibility that
an endogenous  xxxd1422xxx  of the hntr2 might also
exist. complex modulation of the  xxxg1619xxx  would ensue from the
interplay of agonist,  xxxd1422xxx , and neutral antagonist,
and in such a system, nt might elicit a biological response by
reversing the effect of either an agonist or an  xxxd1422xxx .
as mentioned above, it will now be necessary to demonstrate
that the  xxxg1619xxx  is constitutively active in cells or tissues that
normally express the receptor. primary culture of cortical
glial cells might be a useful system in this regard as these
cells that are devoid of ntr1 have been reported to express
nt receptors with pharmacological properties similar to
those of the  xxxg1619xxx  (nouel et al., 1999). the nt analogs
described here with selectivity for and  xxxd1422xxx  activity at the  xxxg1619xxx  should provide tools for assessing the constitutive activity of the glial nt receptor. finally, the ongoing
search for more selective ligands of the  xxxg1619xxx  should hopefully help investigating the biological function of this interesting receptor.

have an  xxxd3454xxx  (jmv 458) or l-nal (jmv 510) in this position
did not affect constitutive ip production in hntr2-expressing cells. the latter analogs, in contrast to the partial inverse
agonists, lacked selectivity for the hntr2 versus the hntr1
(see table 1). interestingly,  xxxd2469xxx , a totally selective
 xxxg1619xxx  versus ntr1 ligand, exhibited partial  xxxd1422xxx 
activity in the present study. this raises the question of
whether inverse agonism is linked to selectivity at the
hntr2. we are currently testing other nt analogs to answer
this question.
one of the striking findings of this work is the neutral
antagonist behavior of nt. the peptide had no effect by itself
on ip production and reversed the effects of both sr 48692
(agonist) and jmv 457 ( xxxd1422xxx ). however, its potency against sr 48692 and jmv 457 was noticeably lower
than its binding potency determined in a homologous binding
assay. it is generally assumed that neutral ligands have the
same affinity for the r (inactive) and r* (active) states of a
receptor as defined in the allosteric ternary complex model
(lefkowitz et al., 1993). however, a recent study with the
constitutively active viral  xxxg565xxx  orf-74
pointed to a more complex mode of binding of neutral ligands
(rosenkilde and schwartz, 2000). orf-74 can bind a variety
of structurally related chemokines that behave either as agonists, neutral ligands, or inverse agonists at the receptor.
rosenkilde and schwartz (2000) showed that high-affinity
neutral ligands (as determined in homologous binding assays) competed with low affinity for binding against either a
radiolabeled agonist or a radiolabeled  xxxd1422xxx . such a
situation might apply here to nt and account for the discrepancy between binding affinity and biological potency against
sr 48692 or jmv 457. this hypothesis, to be tested directly,
will require the availability of radiolabeled agonist or inverse
agonist ligands with sufficient affinity for the  xxxg1619xxx .
the ntr1 and  xxxg1619xxx  share 60% homology in their amino
acid sequence and yet exhibit strikingly different pharmacological properties, such as constitutive activity for the hntr2
and opposite pharmacological profiles for nt and sr 48692.
comparison of the sequences of both receptors might thus
shed some light as to which structural domains may confer
its “strange” behavior to the hntr2. in a recent study, using
mutagenesis approaches combined with structure-activity
studies and computer-assisted molecular modeling, we established tridimensional models of the sr 48692 and nt binding
sites in the rntr1 (labbé-jullié et al., 1998; barroso et al.,
2000). the data showed that the sr 48692 binding site comprised residues in transmembrane domains (tm) 6 and 7
whereas that of nt involved residues in tm6 and in the third
extracellular loop (e3) that connects tm6 and tm7 (fig. 5).
with very few exceptions, the residues involved in sr 48692
