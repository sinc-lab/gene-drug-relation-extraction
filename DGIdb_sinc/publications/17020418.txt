estrogens are biosynthesised from androgens by the cyp450 enzyme complex
called aromatase. aromatase is expressed in the ovary, placenta, brain, bone,
adipose tissue and breast tissue. in breast cancer, intratumoural aromatase is
the source for local estrogen production in the tissue. inhibition of aromatase
is an important approach for reducing growth stimulatory effects of estrogens in estrogen-dependent breast cancer. the potent and selective
third-generation aromatase inhibitors anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane
were introduced to the market as endocrine therapy in postmenopausal
patients failing anti-estrogen therapy alone, or multiple hormonal therapies.
anastrozole and letrozole are both non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors that
compete with the substrate for binding to the enzyme active site. exemestane is a mechanism-based steroidal inhibitor that mimics the substrate, is
converted by the enzyme to a reactive intermediate, and results in inactivation of aromatase. these third-generation aromatase inhibitors are currently
approved as first-line therapy for the treatment of postmenopausal women
with metastatic estrogen-dependent breast cancer. the use of an aromatase
inhibitor as initial therapy, or after treatment with tamoxifen, is now recommended as adjuvant hormonal therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone-dependent breast cancer. several clinical studies of aromatase
inhibitors focus on the use of these agents in the adjuvant setting, for the
treatment of early breast cancer. recently published results show improved
responses with these agents compared with tamoxifen.

introduction

estrogens are involved in numerous physiological processes, including the development and maintenance of the female sexual organs, the reproductive cycle, reproduction and various neuroendocrine functions. these hormones also have crucial roles in
certain diseased states, particularly in mammary and endometrial carcinomas. cancer
is the leading cause of death among women between the ages of 30 and 54, with
breast and uterine cancers comprising 28 and 10%, respectively, of all cancers in
females per year. an estimated 212,930 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed,
and 40,970 women in the us will die from breast cancer in 2006 [1]. of all postmenopausal breast cancer patients, approximately two-thirds have hormone-dependent (estrogen-dependent) breast cancer, which involves estrogen receptors and
requires estrogen for tumour growth. estrogens produce normal physiological effects
by binding to specific nuclear receptor proteins,  xxxg730xxx  alpha and estrogen
receptor beta. the predominant  xxxg730xxx  in the female reproductive tract and
mammary glands is  xxxg730xxx  alpha. after the binding of estrogen to its receptor,
estrogen-receptor complexes form homodimers and interact with sequence-specific
estrogen response elements present in the promoter region of responsive genes in

target cell chromatin. binding of the nuclear steroid–receptor
complexes to dna, and interaction with various nuclear
transcriptional factors, such as steroid receptor co-activator
proteins, initiate the transcription of the relevant gene to produce mrna. the elevated mrna levels result in increased
protein synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum. these proteins
include enzymes, receptors and secreted factors that subsequently result in the steroid hormonal response that regulates
cell function, growth and differentiation.

aromatase and estrogen biosynthesis

biochemistry of aromatase
estradiol is the most potent endogenous estrogen, and is
biosynthesised from androgens by the cyp450 enzyme
complex called aromatase [2]. the highest levels of aromatase
are present in the ovaries of premenopausal women, in the
placenta of pregnant women, and in the peripheral adipose tissues of postmenopausal women and of men. aromatase activity
has also been demonstrated in breast tissue in vitro [3-5].
furthermore, expression of aromatase is highest in or near
breast tumour sites [4,6].
the enzyme complex is bound in the endoplasmic reticulum
of the cell, and is comprised of two major proteins [2,7]. one
protein is cyp p450arom, a haemoprotein that converts c19 steroids (androgens) into c18 steroids (estrogens) containing a phenolic a ring [2,8]. the second protein is nadph-cyp450
reductase, which transfers reducing equivalents to cyp
p450arom. in total, 3 moles of nadph and 3 moles of oxygen
are used in the conversion of 1 mole of substrate into 1 mole of
estrogen product (figure 1). aromatisation of androstenedione,
the preferred substrate, proceeds via three successive oxidation
steps, with the first two being hydroxylations of the angular
c-19 methyl group. the final oxidation step proceeds with the
aromatisation of the a ring of the steroid, and the loss of the
c-19 carbon atom as  xxxd2154xxx . this third and final step in
the aromatase reaction oxidatively cleaves the c10–c19 bond,
although the mechanism of this step remains to be explained.
recently, computational chemistry approaches, including density functional theory alone, or in combination with molecular
mechanical methods, have been employed to unravel the mysterious third step of aromatase catalysis [9]. these calculations
support a final catalytic step of aromatase involving the
cyp450 oxene intermediate, 1beta-hydrogen atom abstraction
and release of  xxxd2154xxx  (figure 1).
2.1

aromatase gene expression
over the past two decades, knowledge of the biochemistry,
molecular biology, and regulation of aromatase has greatly
increased. the aromatase gene, designated  xxxg574xxx , encodes
cyp p450arom, and this gene is located on chromosome
15q21.1. the coding region is ∼ 30 kb in size, and the regulatory region is ∼ 93 kb [7,10]. the aromatase gene consists of
10 exons, and its full-length cdna of 3.4 kb encodes a
protein of 503 amino acids. the aromatase protein is a
2.2

1920

glycosylated cyp450 protein with a molecular weight of
approximately 58 kda [11]. the regulation of aromatase is
complex in various tissues, and several tissue-specific promoter regions have been identified upstream from the  xxxg574xxx 
gene [7,12,13]. these tissue-specific promoters include promoter pi.1, 3, 4, 6, 7 and pii (figure 2). promoter pi.1 is the
major promoter used in placental tissues, and is the farthest
upstream. the pii promoter is used in the ovary and in breast
cancer tissues, and it contains a camp response element. promoters pi.3, pi.4, pi.6 and pi.7 are the promoters used in extraglandular sites. promoter pi.4 is the primary promoter used
in normal adipose tissue, and is responsive to glucocorticoids
and cytokines, such as  xxxg1170xxx , il-6 and tnf-alpha. promoter
pi.3 is also present in adipose tissues, such as normal breast
tissue, and pi.3 is elevated in breast cancer tissues.
aromatase in breast cancer tissues
aromatase is found in breast tissue, and the importance of
intratumoural aromatase and local estrogen production is well
established [4,14,15]. aromatase has been measured in the
stromal cell component of normal breast and breast tumours,
but the enzyme has also been detected in breast epithelial cells
in vitro [3,6,15-17]. furthermore, expression of aromatase is
highest in, or near, breast tumour sites [6,15]. the exact cellular
location(s) of aromatase must await more rigorous analysis by
several labs with a new monoclonal antibody now being
developed and evaluated [18].
the increased expression of aromatase cyp p450arom
observed in breast cancer tissues is associated with a switch in
the major promoter region that is used in gene expression, with
promoter ii being the predominant promoter used in breast
cancer tissues [19]. as a result of the use of the alternate promoter, the regulation of estrogen biosynthesis switches from
one controlled primarily by glucocorticoids and cytokines, to a
promoter regulated through camp-mediated pathways [19].
the prostaglandin pge2 increases intracellular camp levels
and stimulates estrogen biosynthesis [19], whereas other
autocrine factors such as  xxxg1170xxx  do not seem to act via pge2 [20].
local production of pge2 via the cyclooxgenase isozymes
(constitutive cox-1 isozyme and inducible cox-2 isozyme)
can influence estrogen biosynthesis and estrogen-dependent
breast cancer. this biochemical mechanism may explain epidemiological observations of the beneficial effects of nsaids on
breast cancer [21-24]. investigations using human breast cancer
patient specimens have demonstrated a strong linear correlation
between  xxxg574xxx  expression and the sum of cox-1 and cox-2
expression [25]. similar correlations between  xxxg574xxx  expression
and cox-2 expression in breast cancer patient specimens have
been confirmed in other laboratories [26]. in human breast
stromal cells, pge2 acts via two g-protein-coupled receptors:
ep1 and  xxxg1873xxx , to stimulate aromatase gene expression via protein
kinase a and protein kinase c signalling pathways [27]. nsaids,
cox-1 and cox-2 selective inhibitors produce dose-dependent decreases in aromatase activity, and in aromatase mrna
levels in breast cancer tissues [28,29]. this relationship between

the aromatase and cyclooxygenase enzyme systems suggests that
autocrine and paracrine mechanisms may be involved in
hormone-dependent breast cancer development via growth
stimulation from local estrogen biosynthesis (figure 3).

aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer

effective aromatase inhibitors have been developed as therapeutic agents for controlling estrogen-dependent breast cancer
(figure 4). investigations on the development of aromatase
inhibitors began in the 1970s, and have expanded greatly ever

since. research summaries of aromatase inhibitors have been
presented at international aromatase conferences [30-34], and
several reviews have also been published [35-41]. the available
aromatase inhibitors, exemestane, anastrozole and letrozole, are
very effective inhibitors of estrogen biosynthesis (i.e., peripheral
aromatisation) and, thus, are able to lower circulating
estrogen levels in patients (table 1).
steroidal aromatase inhibitors
the design of steroidal aromatase inhibitors is built upon the
basic androstenedione substrate, and incorporates chemical

substituents at varying positions on the steroid. these
inhibitors bind to the aromatase cyp450 enzyme in the same
manner as the substrate androstenedione. 4-hydroxy- xxxd176xxx  ( xxxd2153xxx ,  xxxd2153xxx ,  xxxd2153xxx ), originally thought to be a competitive inhibitor, produces
enzyme-mediated inactivation [42] and causes regression of hormone-dependent mammary rat tumours [43,44].  xxxd2153xxx  is
effective and well tolerated in the treatment of advanced breast
cancer in postmenopausal women [45,46]. however, extensive
first-pass metabolism of this agent in the liver necessitates intramuscular administration and limits its use [47-49]. the
third-generation steroidal inhibitor, exemestane, has increased
efficacy and is used clinically.
exemestane
exemestane (6-methyleneandrost-1,4-diene-3, xxxd2153xxx ,
figure 4) contains an exocyclic double bond at the c-6 carbon
atom, and is a potent steroidal inhibitor of human placental
aromatase. exemestane produces aromatase inactivation
in vitro, and causes regression of hormone-dependent mammary rat tumours [50-52]. it is a potent inhibitor of both,
human placental aromatase (with an apparent ki of 26 nm, a
t½ of 13.9 min and an apparent kinact of 8.30 × 10-4/sec).
exemestane, when administered subcutaneously or orally,
inhibits rat ovarian aromatase (ed50 of 1.8 and 3.7 mg/kg,
respectively) [50,53].
a single dose of exemestane 25 mg p.o. was found to
cause a long-lasting reduction in plasma and urinary estrogen levels. maximal suppression of circulating estrogens
occurred 2 – 3 days after dosing, and persisted for 4 – 5 days [54].
the lengthy duration of estrogen suppression is thought to
be related to the irreversible nature of the drug–enzyme
interaction, rather than pharmacokinetic properties of the
compound. exemestane is also well tolerated, causes a
marked decrease in serum and urine estrogen levels, and has
3.1.1

no effect on other endocrine factors [54-58]. increased doses
of exemestane can lead to suppression of  xxxg2066xxx  [59,60] and this drug has been shown to inhibit
peripheral aromatase by 97 – 98% [56,61].
exemestane has also shown enhanced efficacy over
tamoxifen as first-line therapy in postmenopausal women
with advanced breast cancer [62]. in these clinical studies, the
aromatase inhibitors demonstrated improved clinical efficacy
in primary end points of objective response rates (complete
response, partial response or disease stabilisation), time to
progression, and time to treatment failure. patients positive
for  xxxg730xxx  and/or  xxxg1737xxx  who were
treated with aromatase inhibitors had better response rates
than the patients treated with tamoxifen. in adjuvant therapy
studies, the intergroup exemestane study enrolled 4742 postmenopausal women who had taken tamoxifen for 2 or
3 years, and these patients were randomised to two treatment
arms of tamoxifen for a total of 5 years, or exemestane to
complete the 5-year hormonal therapy. exemestane therapy after
2 – 3 years of tamoxifen therapy significantly reduced breast
cancer recurrence and contralateral breast cancer, compared
with the standard 5 years of tamoxifen treatment [63].
non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors
non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors possess a hetero-atom as a
common chemical feature, and interfere with steroid hydroxylations by the binding of this hetero-atom with the haem iron
of cyp450 enzymes. initial non-steroidal inhibitors were less
enzyme-specific, and inhibited (to varying degrees) other
cyp450-mediated hydroxylations of steroidogenesis.
 xxxd147xxx  (figure 4) was the prototype for nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors [64]. although  xxxd147xxx 
is effective in vivo at inhibiting aromatase, and decreasing
estrogen levels, it also inhibited a number of other steroidogenic cyp450 enzymes, and resulted in significant toxicity.
the newer non-steroidal inhibitors, commonly referred to as
third-generation aromatase inhibitors, are triazole derivatives,
and exhibit a higher degree of specificity and very low toxicity
(figure 4). these newer agents are 100- to 3000-times more
active than  xxxd147xxx  and are all able to inhibit
whole body aromatisation by > 96%.
3.2

anastrozole
anastrozole, an achiral triazole derivative, is a potent aromatase inhibitor with an ic50 of 15 nm in human placental
microsomes [65]. in vitro, anastrozole has no effect on
numerous other p450 enzymes such as, cyp  xxxg570xxx ,
11beta-hydroxylase, 18-hydroxylase, 17alpha-hydroxylase and lanosterol-14alpha-demethylase. in vivo studies in monkeys showed
that anastrozole, at a dose of < 0.2 mg/kg a day, reduced
peripheral aromatase activity by 50 – 60% [65].
anastrozole is a potent nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor in
patients, decreasing plasma estradiol levels in a dose-dependent manner and producing ∼ 97% inhibition of estrogen
biosynthesis at the dose of 1 mg/day [66]. anastrozole was well

tolerated in two large phase iii trials of anastrozole versus
 xxxd2557xxx  in patients who progressed on tamoxifen,
and the combined analysis demonstrated a clinically significant advantage over  xxxd2557xxx  [67-69]. two randomised, double-blind studies demonstrated that
anastrozole (1 mg/day) was more effective than tamoxifen
(20 mg/day) as first-line therapy in postmenopausal women
with advanced breast cancer [70-72]. anastrozole, at the
recommended therapeutic dose of 1 mg/day effectively
suppressed total-body aromatisation, with a mean percentage inhibition of 97%, and suppressed plasma estrone and
estradiol levels by 81 – 85% in postmenopausal women with
metastatic breast cancer [66]. in clinical trials with postmenopausal women, no changes were detected in levels of androgens, an increase in the gonadotropins; leuteinising
hormone and follicle stimulating hormone, was observed
over time. a decrease in  xxxg2066xxx  was
also detected [73].
the randomised, adjuvant phase iii clinical trial, referred
to as atac (anastrozole, tamoxifen alone, or in combination), recruited 9366 postmenopausal women with early
breast cancer. patients were randomised to one of the three
treatment arms for 5 years. after a median follow-up of
47 months, the anastrozole arm of the study resulted in statistically significant reductions in breast cancer events, and
improvement of disease-free survival [74,75]. no differences
in disease-free survival were observed between the
tamoxifen-alone arm and the combination arm.
letrozole
letrozole, another triazole derivative, is a potent inhibitor of
aromatase, with an ic50 of 11.5 nm in human placental
microsomes [76]. letrozole has no effect on the biosynthesis
of other steroids such as aldosterone, progesterone or corticosterone in vitro. letrozole was determined to be
orally-active in vivo, and was observed to cause regression of
tumours in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene hormone-dependent rat tumour models. it also demonstrated aromatase
inhibition in patients [77].
letrozole produces ∼ 99% inhibition of estrogen biosynthesis at the dose of 2.5 mg/day in patients [78]. clinical
studies, involving postmenopausal women with advanced
breast cancer, who had numerous previous endocrine treatments, showed that letrozole produced either a partial response
or stabilisation of disease in ∼ 40% of the women [79,80]. letrozole is also well tolerated, causes a marked decrease in serum
and urine estrogen levels and has little effect on other endocrine factors. in clinical trials with postmenopausal women,
plasma levels of androgens were unchanged with letrozole
treatment, and increases in leuteinising hormone, follicle
stimulating hormone and  xxxg2066xxx 
were detected over time [81]. a multi-centre, randomised,
double-blind study in advanced breast cancer reported letrozole to be more effective than tamoxifen in response rate,
clinical benefit, time to progression and time to treatment
3.2.2

failure [82]. letrozole, at the recommended therapeutic dose
of 2.5 mg/day, effectively suppressed total-body aromatisation, with a mean percentage inhibition of 99%, and suppressed plasma estrone and estradiol levels by 84 – 88% in
postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer [83].
the ma-17 adjuvant clinical trial recruited 5187 postmenopausal women who had taken tamoxifen for 5 years, and
these patients were randomised to two treatment arms of
letrozole or placebo for an additional 5 years. after a median
follow-up of 2.4 years, the letrozole-treated patients had a significant reduction of breast cancer events [84]. in this analysis,
the data safety and monitoring committee for the ma-17
study recommended that the trial be prematurely halted, and
the participants informed of the positive results.
clinical uses of aromatase inhibitors
the third-generation aromatase inhibitors are approved in
the us for the treatment of postmenopausal women with
metastatic estrogen-dependent breast cancer. both anastrozole and letrozole are more effective than tamoxifen as
first-line therapy in postmenopausal women with advanced
breast cancer [70-72,85]. exemestane has also shown enhanced
efficacy over tamoxifen as first-line therapy in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer [62]. in these clinical
studies, the aromatase inhibitors demonstrated improved
clinical efficacy in primary end points of objective response
rates (complete response, partial response or disease stabilisation), time to progression and time to treatment failure.
patients who were positive for  xxxg730xxx  and/or  xxxg1737xxx  had better response rates when treated
with aromatase inhibitors compared with patients treated
with tamoxifen. overall, the third-generation aromatase
inhibitors are well tolerated in these clinical trials of postmenopausal women with hormone-dependent metastatic
breast cancer.
recent clinical studies of aromatase inhibitors focused on
the use of the agents in the adjuvant setting for the treatment of early breast cancer [86-89]. these studies assessed the
effectiveness of aromatase inhibitors following tamoxifen,
of aromatase inhibitors alone, and/or of the combination of
aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen in adjuvant therapy
(table 2). based on the results of multiple, large, randomised trials, the american society of clinical oncology
(asco) technology assessment panel [90] recommends that
the ‘optimal adjuvant hormonal therapy for a postmenopausal
woman with receptor-positive breast cancer includes an
aromatase inhibitor as initial therapy or after treatment
with tamoxifen’.
these multiple, large, randomised trials also enabled a
more thorough analysis of the tolerability and adverse events
of the aromatase inhibitors. in general, patients on aromatase
inhibitors experienced fewer gynaecological symptoms such as
endometrial cancer, vaginal bleeding and vaginal discharges.
fewer cerebrovascular events and venous thromboembolic
events were also observed with patients receiving aromatase

inhibitors. no information is available on the effects of
aromatase inhibitors on serum lipid levels, cardiovascular
disease and coronary heart disease risk. on the other hand,
musculoskeletal effects and bone toxicity are associated with
aromatase inhibitors. the percentages of musculoskeletal
effects, which include increased arthritis, arthralgia and/or
myalgia, were small, but showed statistically significant
increases with aromatase inhibitors compared with tamoxifen.
all three aromatase inhibitors were associated with increased
fractures when compared with tamoxifen or placebo. the
atac trial reported a 7.1% fracture incidence in the anastrozole arm versus tamoxifen at 4.4% [74,75]. in the ma-17 study,
fractures in the letrozole-treated patients were 3.6% compared
with 2.9% in the placebo group, after 2 or 3 years of prior
tamoxifen treatment [84]. exemestane was associated with
osteoporosis and/or increased fractures (7.41%) when compared with tamoxifen (5.7%) in the intergroup exemestane
study trial. baseline bone mineral density evaluations and
potential bisphosphonate therapy are recommended for
patients being treated with aromatase inhibitors [90].
on-going clinical studies are designed to compare the various aromatase inhibitors and/or combination therapies in
early-stage breast cancer, or in the chemoprevention setting.
recently, a randomised, phase iii, double-blind trial, referred
to as the big (breast international group) 1-98 study, compared various adjuvant endocrine therapy regimens in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer.
the first analysis of the monotherapy arms of the big 1-98
study compared letrozole versus tamoxifen treatment [91]. after
a median follow-up of 25.8 months, adjuvant treatment with
letrozole significantly reduced the risk of recurrent disease
compared with tamoxifen. an example of clinical studies on

combination therapy is ma-27, a phase iii adjuvant trial in
postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer comparing
exemestane with anastrozole, with or without celecoxib
(a cox-2 inhibitor).
the neoadjuvant randomised trials of aromatase inhibitors
in early stage breast cancer also provide opportunities for
examination of responses in subgroups of breast cancer
patients. for example,  xxxg730xxx -positive and
her2-positive breast cancer patients have a diminished
response to tamoxifen, whereas the response to letrozole [92] or
anastrozole [93] does not seem to be affected by her2 overexpression. however, the numbers of patients in these two subset analyses were too small to provide definitive conclusions.
as the  xxxg730xxx  positive and her2-positive breast
tumours are not common, the design of more focused clinical
trials involving both biomarker analyses and patient outcomes
will be necessary in the future.
the potential for aromatase inhibitors in the chemoprevention setting, in women with increased risk for the development of breast cancer, is also being considered. in pre-clinical
models, aromatase inhibitors reduce tumour formation in the
carcinogen-induced rat mammary tumour studies [94-97]. the
ibis ii (international breast cancer intervention study ii)
will compare anastrozole versus placebo in a prevention study,
and the accompanying dcis study will compare tamoxifen
versus anastrozole in women with locally excised ductal carcinoma in situ [98]. a canadian breast cancer prevention study,
ncic map3, is a three-arm study of placebo versus exemestane versus exemestane and celecoxib [98]. important end
points in such trials may not only include reduction in
tumour incidence, but may also examine effects of aromatase
inhibitors on bone mineral density and serum lipid levels.

conclusion

aromatase inhibitors, both steroidal and non-steroidal agents,
have been shown to be useful for the treatment of breast
cancer by preventing the synthesis of estrogens in the body.
aromatase inhibitors seem to be more effective in postmenopausal women than in premenopausal women, due to the fact
that the major source of estrogen biosynthesis in postmenopausal women is adipose tissue. both  xxxd3411xxx  have developed into very potent compounds
that are highly selective for aromatase versus other steroidogenic cyp450 enzymes. the potent, selective and
orally-active third-generation aromatase inhibitors, anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane, were initially approved for
clinical use as endocrine therapy in postmenopausal patients
failing antiestrogen therapy alone or multiple hormonal therapies. based on the results of multiple, large, randomised trials,
the asco panel recommends an aromatase inhibitor as initial
therapy in adjuvant hormonal therapy for a postmenopausal
woman with receptor-positive breast cancer, or after treatment
of these patients with tamoxifen.

expert opinion

future directions of basic and clinical research on aromatase
inhibitors in breast cancer will focus on several areas. recent
clinical studies have shown that these aromatase inhibitors
are more effective than tamoxifen in postmenopausal patients
with metastatic breast cancer. these agents are approved for
the treatment of postmenopausal women with metastatic
estrogen-dependent breast cancer. the third-generation aromatase inhibitors are now being studied in the adjuvant setting, either alone, or in combination with other agents. early
results from trials, such as atac and big 1-98, suggest that
aromatase inhibitors are more effective than tamoxifen in
postmenopausal patients with early-stage hormone-dependent breast cancer. if the ongoing adjuvant trials confirm these
results, the aromatase inhibitors may then become the
preferred first-line therapy in such patients. in addition, as
clinical use of the existing aromatase inhibitors continues, an

understanding of the side effects and possible toxicities from
the long-term use of the drugs will become clear. although
the aromatase inhibitors are well tolerated, musculoskeletal
disorders, fractures and elevated serum lipid levels have been
observed in several recent clinical trials. in addition, the
effect of long-term aromatase inhibitor therapy on osteoporosis is not yet characterised. future clinical studies of aromatase inhibitors with or without bone-sparing agents (such
as bisphosphonates) will be required to adequately address
these possible toxicities. finally, decreased occurrence of contralateral breast cancer in clinical trials of aromatase inhibitors suggest that aromatase inhibitors may be useful in the
chemoprevention setting, in women with increased risk for
the development of breast cancer. future preclinical and
clinical studies are needed to assess this chemopreventive
potential. the tissue-specific regulation of aromatase expression provides an opportunity for new pharmacological
approaches in the regulation of aromatase in breast cancer.
the relationship between the aromatase and cyclooxygenase
enzyme systems on local estrogen biosynthesis in
hormone-dependent breast cancer suggests that the combination of an aromatase inhibitor with nsiads, or a cox-2
inhibitor, may increase efficacy beyond the present treatments for postmenopausal hormone-dependent breast cancer. another pharmacological approach based on the
tissue-specific regulation of aromatase expression is the
design and development of novel agents that target a specific
regulatory pathway for aromatase expression found only in
breast cancer cells. recent investigations suggest that such an
approach may be possible [99]. in summary, the development
and use of the third-generation aromatase inhibitors have
significantly improved the therapy outcomes for postmenopausal women with hormone-dependent breast cancer, and
future research is likely to build upon this success.
