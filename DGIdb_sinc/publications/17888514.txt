abstract
interest has recently been rekindled in receptors that are activated by low molecular weight, noncatecholic, biogenic amines that are typically
found as trace constituents of various vertebrate and invertebrate tissues and fluids. the timing of this resurgent focus on receptors activated by the
“trace amines” (ta)  xxxd2901xxx  (pea), tyramine (tyr), octopamine (oct), synephrine (syn), and tryptamine (tryp) is the direct
result of 2 publications that appeared in 2001 describing the cloning of a novel g protein-coupled receptor (gpcr) referred to by their discoverers
borowsky et al. as  xxxg2239xxx  and bunzow et al. as ta receptor 1 ( xxxg2239xxx ). when heterologously expressed in xenopus laevis oocytes and various
eukaryotic cell lines, recombinant rodent and human tar dose-dependently couple to the stimulation of adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (camp)
production. structure–activity profiling based on this functional response has revealed that in addition to the ta, other biologically active
compounds containing a 2-carbon aliphatic side chain linking an amino group to at least 1 benzene ring are potent and efficacious ta receptor
agonists with amphetamine (amph), methamphetamine, 3-iodothyronamine, thyronamine, and dopamine (da) among the most notable. almost
100 years after the search for tar began, numerous  xxxg2239xxx / xxxg2239xxx -related sequences, now called ta-associated receptors (taar), have been
identified in the genome of every species of vertebrate examined to date. consequently, even though heterologously expressed taar1 fits the
pharmacological criteria established for a bona fide tar, a major challenge for those working in the field is to discern the in vivo pharmacology
and physiology of each purported member of this extended family of gpcr. only then will it be possible to establish whether taar1 is the
family archetype or an iconoclast.

1. introduction
the “trace amines” (ta; usdin & sandler, 1976; baldessarini & fischer, 1977), also referred to in the literature as “false
transmitters” (kopin et al., 1964), “microamines” (boulton,
1976a), and noncatecholic phenylethylamines (mosnaim &
wolf, 1980), form a small collection of chemically related, low
molecular weight, naturally occurring aromatic aliphatic
compounds with potent sympathomimetic actions, as originally
defined by barger, dale, and dixon (dale & dixon, 1909;
barger & dale, 1910). traditionally included among this group

of compounds are  xxxd2901xxx  (pea), para-hydroxyphenylethylamine ( p-tyramine [tyr]), octopamine (oct),
synephrine (syn), and tryptamine (tryp). fig. 1 depicts the
structures for each of the compounds discussed in the text.
structurally these compounds are closely related to the
classic vertebrate biogenic amine neurotransmitters (nt)
dopamine (da), norepinephrine (ne), epinephrine (epi), and
serotonin (5-ht). ta are also close relatives of the synthetic
phenylethylamine psychostimulant amphetamine (amph) and
its numerous analogs (e.g., methamphetamine [meth]; cho &
segal, 1994; sulzer et al., 2005). in addition to being physically

related, the ta are similar to the vertebrate biogenic amine nt
in terms of their biosynthesis, cellular localization, anatomic
distribution, degradation, and elimination (boulton & quan,
1970; boulton & wu, 1972, 1973; wu & boulton, 1973).
given so many similarities with the biogenic amine nt,
most working in the field were surprised by the technical
challenges they encountered while attempting to demonstrate
functional receptors that mediate the biological effects of
ta.
the ta are produced by many, if not all, genera of
prokaryotes and eukaryotes. in the kingdom animalia,
endogenously produced ta have been detected in all
invertebrate and vertebrate species examined to date, including
humans (philips et al., 1978; d'andrea et al., 2003a; berry,
2004; jacob & presti, 2005). as a result of their widespread
occurrence in both the plant and animal kingdoms, foodstuffs
can contain appreciable amounts of ta either inherently (e.g.,
cacao from which chocolate is produced), as an unintentional
consequence of bacterial action (e.g., food spoilage; nencki,
1876; jeanneret, 1877; gale, 1940; geornaras et al., 1995), as

an intentional consequence of bacterial action (e.g., cheese,
beer, and wine production by fermentation; lonvaud-funel,
2001), or through fungal infestation of grain stuffs (e.g., ergotinfected rye; barger & dale, 1909). additionally, ta are
generated in the gastrointestinal tract of vertebrates by the
action of bacterial aromatic amino acid decarboxylase ( xxxg618xxx )
during the normal course of digesting a protein-rich meal
(jansen et al., 2003).
under most circumstances dietary ta absorbed in the
gastrointestinal system are rapidly catabolized to harmless
compounds by the oxidative deamination capabilities of
 xxxg1358xxx  (mao-b; mccabe & tsuang, 1982;
mccabe, 1986). however, this reaction also results in the
production of  xxxd2298xxx  (h2o2) and other reactive
oxygen species that can subsequently have detrimental effects
(sandri et al., 1990). furthermore, abnormal blood levels of ta
can build up in certain pathological conditions (e.g., phenylketonuria) in individuals receiving inhibitors of mao, and in acute
ergot poisoning during which toxic levels of ta can occur,
resulting in dramatic behavioral changes including repetitive

movements (stereotypy), psychosis, and life-threatening circulatory disturbances that can lead to gangrene.
historically, it has been these notable manifestations of
extracts prepared from ergot and putrefied meat that originally
motivate physiologists, pharmacologists, physicians, and medicinal chemists to better understand the mechanism(s) by
which the ta act. the recent cloning of vertebrate metabotropic
g protein-coupled receptors (gpcr) activated by ta provides
an exciting new opportunity in this regard that promises to
expand our comprehension of the biological roles these simple
but fascinating compounds play (reviewed in kim & von
zastrow, 2001; premont et al., 2001; branchek & blackburn,
2003; davenport, 2003; berry, 2004; lindemann et al., 2005;
lindemann & hoener, 2005; burchett & hicks, 2006; lewin,
2006; zucchi et al., 2006).
2. natural history of the trace amines
2.1. discovery of the prototypical trace amines
of the ta, pea is structurally the simplest with the molecular
formula  xxxd2901xxx . pea is also the most studied ta and is widely
considered prototypical. the first mention of a compound with
this composition can be traced back to a presentation given by
the physiological chemist professor nencki (1876) during a
festschrift in honor of the 40-year career of a prof. valentin of
bern, switzerland.
it was in the course of his own long research effort to
understand the processes of putrefaction and fermentation that
nencki, a contemporary of louis pasteur, isolated from
decomposing gelatin an aryl alkyl amine with the chemical
composition of pea,  xxxd2901xxx .
nencki's protégé jules jeanneret shared his mentor's interest
in understanding the relationship between these 2 economically
important processes: fermentation and putrefaction. in bern,
during the fall of 1876 and the winter of 1877, jeanneret
conducted a series of studies in nencki's laboratory where he
confirmed the presence of pea in decomposing gelatin and, in
addition, discovered the same substance in putrid egg white
(jeanneret, 1877).
by 1879, it was appreciated by schulze and barbieri
(guggenheim, 1951) that pea can be produced by bacterial
decarboxylation of the amino acid phenylalanine (f) under
anaerobic conditions. in 1882 and 1883, gautier and etard
demonstrated the presence of pea in decomposing mackerel
(guggenheim, 1951). pea was reported in 1896 to be a
byproduct of decomposing fibrin by emmerling (guggenheim,
1951). ten years later, winterstein and bisegger made the
interesting observation that ripe emmanthaler cheese can have a
high pea content (guggenheim, 1951). it is also now known
that pea can be found at varying concentrations in other
products of fermentation, including wines, beers, and cheeses
(da prada et al., 1988; skerritt et al., 2000).
pea has also been isolated from several plant species and
was reported by white to constitute as much as 1% of an extract
prepared from acacia floribunda blossoms (guggenheim,
1951). guided by the philosophy that evolutionary pressure

selects inheritable characteristics conferring a reproductive
advantage, it has been proposed that the ta confer a selective
advantage on certain species of plants due to their ability to deter
animal foragers (smith, 1977; kawano et al., 2000a, 2000b;
enan, 2005) in addition to their cultivation by human consumers
(furst, 1972, 1976; booth, 1996).
although the advent of the 20th century saw pea accepted as
a natural byproduct of fermentation, its biological properties were
not yet appreciated. this was to change in 1906 when abelous
and colleagues demonstrated that organic extracts of putrefied
horsemeat could dramatically raise arterial blood pressure.
among the investigators who followed up on this observation
were 2 chemists, barger and walpole. they have the distinction
of being the first to isolate and purify pea and tyr (historically
the term ergotamine was originally used to refer to the latter
compound, see clark, 1911, but today refers to a different
compound) from a biological source (i.e., putrefied horsemeat)
and in collaboration with the physiologist h.h. dale to
demonstrate its ability to cause a robust physiological response:
a rapid rise in arterial pressure when injected intravenously
(barger & walpole, 1909; barger & dale, 1910; clark, 1911).
organic chemists had been familiar with pea and tyr for
years prior to their isolation from decomposing meat (barger &
walpole, 1909) and ergot fungus-infested cereals (barger &
dale, 1909). but not until the pioneering work of barger, clark,
dale, dixon, and walpole was it firmly established that the
biogenic amines ptyr and pea were, in fact, the mysterious
substances present in aqueous extracts of decomposing animal
matter (barger & walpole, 1909) and preparations used in
obstetrics made from ergot fungus extracts that possessed potent
“ xxxd2007xxx -like” pressor-inducing and uterus-mobilizing capabilities (dale & dixon, 1909; barger & dale, 1909, 1910).
although these ground breaking studies unquestionably
demonstrated the ability of naturally derived ptyr and pea
to produce significant physiological responses in vertebrates,
their work left unanswered important questions including:
how are endogenous ta synthesized? do endogenous ta
serve important biological roles? if endogenous ta have a
biological function, how then are their actions mediated and
terminated?
2.2. biosynthesis and turnover of the trace amines
some have referred to the ta as members of the “first
family” (pea, tyr, oct, da, ne, and phenylethanolamine)
of nt (walker & kerkut, 1978; boulton, 1983) and in the
context of catecholamine biosynthesis, this is literally true.
the enzymatic pathways that generate ta pea, tyr, oct,
tryp have always been of considerable interest because they
also participate in the biosynthesis of the catecholamines da,
ne, and epi (kopin, 1968). given that the absence of an alpha
carboxyl moiety is all that distinguishes these compounds from
the aromatic amino acids tyrosine (y), f, and tryptophan (w),
respectively, early biochemists attempted to experimentally
establish that the latter's enzymatic decarboxylation was the
most likely route to the former (barger & dale, 1909; dale &
dixon, 1909). immediately prior to this time it had been shown

d.k. grandy / pharmacology & therapeutics 116 (2007) 355–390

that tyr and pea could be formed from y and f via
decarboxylation reactions performed by bacteria and other
unicellular organisms (jeanneret, 1877; guggenheim, 1951).
although simple, in concept it proved difficult in practice to
unquestionably demonstrate that a similar  xxxg618xxx  enzymatic
activity was endogenous to animal tissues (blaschko, 1942;
blaschko & chrusciel, 1960; lovenberg et al., 1962) and can
yield both pea (mosnaim et al., 1974; sabelli et al., 1974) and
tyr (boulton & quan, 1970; boulton & wu, 1973) although
other routes of synthesis certainly exist (boulton & quan, 1970;
sabelli et al., 1996).
it is important to note that  xxxg618xxx  enzymatic activity is tightly
regulated. sensory stimuli (e.g., light; hadjiconstantinou et al.,
1988) increase retinal  xxxg618xxx  activity as do pharmacologic
agents that antagonize  xxxg831xxx -adrenergic receptors and da d1
receptors whereas their agonists decrease  xxxg618xxx  activity
(rossetti et al., 1989, 1990). in the striatum  xxxg618xxx  mrna is
increased in response to chronic inhibition of da receptors
(buckland et al., 1992) and its enzymatic activity is elevated in
response to antagonists of da d1 and d2 receptors (hadjiconstantinou et al., 1993; zhu et al., 1992, 1993; cho et al., 1997)
while da receptor agonists depress  xxxg618xxx  activity (hadjiconstantinou et al., 1993; zhu et al., 1994; cho et al., 1997). in this
context it is interesting to note that reith et al. (1994) found
elevated  xxxg618xxx  activity in patients with psychosis while more
recently laakso et al. (2005) found evidence that the human da
 xxxg656xxx  a1 allele (grandy et al., 1989) is associated with
elevated activity of striatal  xxxg618xxx  in healthy subjects.
changes in  xxxg618xxx  activity are known to influence ta
accumulation with da antagonists increasing striatal pea
(juorio et al., 1991a) and tryp (juorio, 1982) while causing
behavioral supersensitivity to pea (stoff et al., 1984).
electrical stimulation of midbrain neurons in the substantia
nigra results in a decrease in accumulation of pea (juorio et al.,
1991b) and tyr (jones et al., 1983).
not surprisingly, within 60 min of an acute dose of amph
striatal pea levels are reduced (borison et al., 1974, 1975;
juorio et al., 1991a) concomitant with a decrease in striatal
synaptosomal  xxxg618xxx  enzyme activity (zhu et al., 1994).
chronic amph exposure results in a reduction in detectable
 xxxg618xxx  mrna (buckland et al., 1996). the molecular
mechanisms by which  xxxg618xxx  activity is regulated have been
shown to include post-translational phosphorylation of the
protein by both  xxxg1836xxx  (pka) (duchemin et al., 2000)
and cgmp-dependent protein kinase (hadjiconstantinou et al.,
2003).
since  xxxg618xxx  is widely expressed in vertebrate brain, a given
cell's biogenic amine nt phenotype (i.e., histamine [his], 5ht, or the catecholamines da and ne) is going to be determined
by the other enzymes it expresses. in this context it is interesting
to note that immunohistochemical studies have revealed the
existence of unique neuron-like “d"-cells that are aadcpositive but lack y hydroxylase (th), tryptophan hydroxylase,
and 5-ht immunoreactivity (jaeger et al., 1984a, 1984b;
kitahama et al., 1990; beltramo et al., 1993). there is also
evidence for endogenous tryp producing “b”-cells that are
indolamine-containing but distinct from 5-ht neurons in their

359

microspectrofluorometric and pharmacological properties
(björklund et al., 1976).
following its decarboxylation by  xxxg618xxx  and in the presence
of da beta-hydroxylase, tyr is now known to be converted to
oct (brandau & axelrod, 1972), first discovered in the
salivary glands of the octopus (erspamer & boretti, 1951). syn
is then generated by methylation of oct through the action of
phenylethanolamine-n-methyl transferase (axelrod & saavedra, 1977). in an enzymatic reaction analogous to the
decarboxylation of y and f the amino acid w is decarboxylated
to yield tryp (saavedra & axelrod, 1972a, 1972b, 1974a,
1974b).
concurrent with the studies that demonstrated the in vivo
enzymatic decarboxylation and methylation of these aromatic
amino acids axelrod, saavedra, durden, phillips, and others
(saavedra & axelrod, 1972a, 1972b; durden et al., 1973;
saavedra & axelrod, 1974b; tallman et al., 1976a, 1976b;
axelrod & saavedra, 1977; danielson et al., 1977; philips et
al., 1978; durden & phillips, 1980; parker & cubeddu, 1988;
durden & davis, 1993) were developing analytical and
sensitive detection methods that could be used to document
the presence, quantitated the abundance, monitored the
turnover, and described the heterogeneous distribution of
endogenously synthesized tyr, pea, oct, and tryp in the
central nervous system (cns) and numerous peripheral tissues,
including salivary gland, heart, and kidney of several animal
species. in the brain at least, pea is found at a concentration
many hundred-fold lower than da, ne, or 5-ht in the
extracellular space of (i.e., 2–15 nm, henry et al., 1988; scarr
et al., 1994) likely having diffused to its site of synthesis in the
cytoplasm and through the plasma membrane (oldendorf,
1971; boulton & baker, 1975) given its lipophilic nature (mack
& bonisch, 1979; paterson et al., 1990).
even though the concentration of the noncatecholic phenylethylamines is generally very low, hence the moniker ta, they
appear to be synthesized at rates equivalent to the catecholamines (durden & phillips, 1980; paterson et al., 1990), a
disparity that has been interpreted to be the consequence of their
rapid turnover with a half life on the order of 30 sec (durden &
phillips, 1980).
the principle route of ta catabolism is via the mao-a and
mao-b except in the case of pea, which is preferentially if not
exclusively degraded by mao-b (yang & neff, 1973; philips
& boulton, 1979; durden & phillips, 1980). other routes of
metabolism have also been proposed, but they are thought to
contribute in only minor ways or become significant only under
special circumstances (saavedra, 1974; danielson et al., 1977;
paterson et al., 1990; yu et al., 2003).
2.3. storage and release of trace amines
it has been difficult to establish exact sites of ta synthesis
and the same holds true for their storage. the ta are detectable
in synaptosomes (baldessarini & vogt, 1972; boulton & baker,
1975) prepared from brain, but to date they have not been shown
to be stored in vesicles. evidence against the storage of ta in
catecholamine-like vesicles has been reported by dyck (1988)

360

d.k. grandy / pharmacology & therapeutics 116 (2007) 355–390

and henry et al. (1988) who were unable to demonstrate k+induced release of pea (dyck, 1988; henry et al., 1988).
instead, the amount of pea “released” is proportional to the
tissue level of pea. this observation may reflect the fact that
pea readily crosses cell membranes (boulton et al., 1990).
reserpine pretreatment also has no effect on tissue levels of pea
(boulton et al., 1977; juorio et al., 1988). in contrast to pea
there is some evidence for activity-dependent release of m- and
p-tyr from striatal slices following veratidine-induced depolarization (dyck, 1988, 1989).
2.4. biological actions of trace amines
2.4.1. classic physiology of the trace amines
traditionally the scientific literature (kopin et al., 1964;
kopin, 1968; baldessarini & fischer, 1977, 1978; baldessarini,
1978) and medical pharmacology texts (e.g., goodman and
gillman's 10th edition, 2005; katzung 10th edition, 2007) refer
to the ta as “false” transmitters or, at best, physiologic
neuromodulators with indirect sympathomimetic effects (berry,
2004). the intention of this designation is to convey that these
molecules do not fulfill the criteria established for acetylcholine
and the biogenic amines his, da, ne, and 5-ht. however, it
should be remembered that ta physiology has been conducted
in bioassays developed to study the actions of acetylcholine and
the catecholamines. other assays might be more revealing.
the physiological actions of ta are relatively weak in the
intact animal compared to the cathecholamines. however, under
conditions where mao activity is inhibited ta levels can
become significantly elevated, displacing more efficacious
“true” nt from their vesicles (ibrahim et al., 1985). at even
higher concentrations ta enhance da release, and to a lesser
extent ne and 5-ht, into synapses. the effects evoked at these
high ta concentrations have been referred to as “amphetaminelike” (berry, 2004; burchett & hicks, 2006).
2.4.1.1. invertebrates. the physiology of ta has been best
studied in invertebrates. secretion by the posterior salivary
gland of the octopus is under the control of oct where it was
first discovered (ghiretti, 1953). oct has a unique distribution
in the lobster (livingstone et al., 1981) where it strongly
influences the heart, exoskeletal muscle (battelle & kravitz,
1978), and the animal's posture (harris-warrick & kravitz,
1984). oct also acts as a neurohormone in this species (kravitz
et al., 1980). in another ancient species, limulus, the horseshoe
crab, battelle et al. (1979) found evidence of ta synthesis in
ventral nerve photoreceptors.
other species of the phylum arthropoda of the class insecta
also depend on oct signaling for survival. in what is perhaps
the first report of an important physiological action of oct in
insects, robertson and steele (1972) demonstrated that low
concentrations stimulate the activity of the glycogen phosphorylase enzyme present in the ventral nerve cord of the cockroach
periplaneta americana. this finding is important for several
reasons, not the least of which being that it demonstrates an
animal's changing energy requirements can be met via
glycogenolysis modulated by ta signaling.

the work of robertson and steele, as well as others,
stimulated further investigations into the physiological actions
of oct. the following year, nathanson and greengard (1973)
reported that low concentrations of oct stimulate a novel
adenylyl cyclase present in thoracic ganglia of p. americana
that is not responsive to either da or 5-ht. subsequent
investigations revealed the cockroach brain expresses an
adenylyl cyclase that is stimulated by oct (harmar & horn,
1977) as well as inhibited by oct (uzzan & dudai, 1982).
oct-induced changes in second messengers control the
firefly's mating flash (nathanson, 1979). oct also stimulates
the contraction of locust skeletal muscle (evans, 1987; evans
et al., 1988) while tyr is active in the oviduct of this species
(donini & lange, 2004). the terminal abdominal ganglion of
the female gypsy moth lymantria dispar is stimulated by oct,
responding with an increase in adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate
(camp) formation and nerve cell firing (olianas et al., 2006).
overall, the effects of ta in invertebrate systems, in particular
oct, resemble the classic actions of ne in vertebrates
(robertson & juorio, 1976; roeder, 1999).
2.4.1.2. vertebrates. the first demonstration in vertebrates of
a physiological effect of chemically pure pea and tyr was
reported by barger and walpole (1909) in collaboration with
dale (barger & dale, 1910) and later expanded upon by clark
(1911). barger and walpole were chemists working at wellcome's herne hill physiological research laboratories in
southeast london. one of them had become interested in the
report by abelous and colleagues of a chloroform-soluble
pressor principle present in decaying meat (abelous et al.,
1906). back in london this observation was quickly reproduced
in the pithed cat bioassay in which a purified organic extract of
putrid ox-heart tails was given intravenously producing a
dramatic, rapid, and long lasting rise in carotid blood pressure.
having validated that their extraction and purification methods
worked on a small scale, ox-hearts were abandoned for
horsemeat in an attempt to increase yield.
their efforts resulted in the identification and characterization of 3 amines: 1 that is soluble in chloroform (isoamylamine)
and 2 that are water soluble ( p-hydroxyphenylethylamine (also
known as p-tyr) and pea. when injected intravenously the
pithed cat responds within 10 min with a rapid rise in arterial
blood pressure. of the 3 compounds, isolated tyr had the
greatest pressor effect while pea was somewhat less efficacious
and isoamylamine was the weakest. this paper is remarkable in
that barger and walpole establish a powerful paradigm in which
a robust biological assay is used to analyze chemical principles,
both natural and synthetic. furthermore, by using a bacteriological preparation to convert vertebrate structures (e.g., muscle
protein) into their most basic molecules, relatively large
amounts of “natural” products with powerful physiological
effects could be produced for experimental study and as
medicines. finally, their work laid the foundation of what
became a fertile field of investigation that continues to be
extremely active a century later.
the next 40 years saw the biogenic amines continue to enjoy
considerable attention although the focus gradually shifted

d.k. grandy / pharmacology & therapeutics 116 (2007) 355–390

more to the catecholamines and the enzymes that synthesize
them. the identification and characterization of  xxxg618xxx  and
mao-a and mao-b led to the development of highly
selective inhibitors that proved to have benefit in some clinical
settings. just as drugs such as iproniazid, an irreversible mao
inhibitor, provided a new means of perturbing catecholamine
physiology, they also provide a means to probe the physiology
of the ta.
zeller and barsky (1952) and griesemer et al. (1953) were
the first to report that iproniazid dramatically potentiates the
cns-stimulating effects of pea in guinea pigs evoking
behavioral excitation and convulsions (rebhun et al., 1954).
these powerful cns effects were further elaborated on the
following year by fleckenstein and stöckle (1955).
several years later spector et al. (1963) published a
distribution of tyr in mammalian tissues. nakajima et al.
(1964) reported perhaps the first evidence of endogenous pea
and its effect on motor tissue in the mouse, while fuxe et al.
(1967) found that pea releases catecholamines from central
and peripheral monoamine-synthesizing neurons. as analytical methods became more sophisticated, ta were unequivocally demonstrated to be present in rat tissue (majer &
boulton, 1970), and in mouse (mosnaim & sabelli, 1971),
rabbit (sabelli et al., 1973; zeller et al., 1976), and finally
human brain (inwang et al., 1973; axelrod & saavedra,
1974). though these findings generated interest among some,
others remained skeptical as to the relevance of ta to human
physiology and health.
this attitude began to change in the early 1960s as
explanations were sought for the hypertensive crisis often
referred to as the cheese effect and the tyr pressor effect (da
prada et al., 1988) that some foods can produce in patients
taking mao inhibitors for depression (mccabe, 1986); the
hypotensive effect of mao inhibitors experienced by patients
on long-term antiangina medication; and the hypotensive effect
of alpha-methylated analogs of m-tyr and  xxxd2471xxx  (l-dopa). the hypertensive response is widely
thought to be due to tyr-activated ne release. the
hypotensive effect seen in chronically medicated patients is
thought to develop because tyr levels become too elevated.
under these conditions, tyr is not metabolized by mao-b so
it can be transported into synaptic vesicles where it is converted
to oct by the action of vesicular da-beta-hydroxylase. this
nascent oct co-occupies the vesicle with ne such that when
depolarization occurs there is less ne released. furthermore, the
oct that is released is less potent at stimulating postsynaptic
alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. thus, according to the
false-transmitter hypothesis, build up of the less physiologically
active ta at the expense of the more active catecholamine
transmitters contributes to the clinical presentation (kopin et al.,
1964; kopin, 1968).
evidence that the actions of ta in the cns are distinct from
those of the catecholamines was reported by sabelli et al.
(1976), who made microelectrode recordings using iontophoretic techniques to demonstrate that pea had opposite effects on
cortical neuron stimulation compared to the inhibitory effects of
da and ne at the same concentration (0.5 m). interestingly

361

these authors then compared the behavioral effects of an
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of pea (10 mg/kg) to those of
epi (1–5 mg/kg), ne (1–5 mg/kg), and da (10–50 mg/kg) in
newly hatched chicks. whereas the catcholamines induced
sleep, pea induced a prolonged amph-like excitement
characterized by increased locomotor activity, chirping, and
aggressive fighting behavior. however, depending on the
tissues these agents can have similar effects (e.g., tyr
inhibition of prolactin from rat pituitary) albeit through distinct
mechanisms of action (becu-villalobos et al., 1987).
besides pea and tyr, oct has been found to affect the
synaptosomal transport of ne (raiteri et al., 1977) as well as
neuronal activity in the rat dorsal horn (hicks & mclennan,
1978a), cerebral cortex (hicks & mclennan, 1978b), and other
regions of the cns (dao & walker, 1980).
2.4.2. trace amines as modulators of neurotransmission
neuromodulators have been defined as compounds present
in the cns that can alter the sensitivity of neurons to other nt
but have no effect on their own.
it has long been appreciated that in invertebrates the ta, in
particular oct and tyr, are likely nt, and not neuromodulators, that substitute for ne (saavedra et al., 1974; robertson
& juorio, 1976; saavedra & axelrod, 1976; axelrod &
saavedra, 1977; evans & o'shea, 1977; roeder, 1999)
although nagaya et al. (2002) found tyr to function as a
neuromodulator in drosophila melanogaster, and donini and
lange (2004) reported evidence that tyr functions as both a
nt and neuromodulator in the locust oviduct.
in mammals, it has been suggested that oct might be a
neuromodulator involved in some of the physiological effects
ascribed to mao inhibitors (kakimoto & armstrong, 1962). in a
series of papers baldessarini and vogt (baldessarini, 1971;
baldessarini & vogt, 1971, 1972) reported ta involvement in
the uptake, subcellular distribution, and release of aromatic
amines in rat brain. in 1975, boulton proposed that the ta have
“direct” and “indirect” effects on synaptic transmission
involving da, ne, and 5-ht (boulton, 1976b). the direct
effects are the result of the ta being released or diffusing to a
receptive site of action. boulton (1976b) hypothesized that ta
would achieve their direct modulatory effects by altering the
sensitivity of a postsynaptic target. the term indirect refers to the
downstream consequences of a ta interfering with catecholamine uptake and/or release.
by 1982 a lively debate surrounded the role of ta in the
cns and could be summed up in the question posed by jones
(1982): does tryp act as a neuromodulator or nt in
mammalian brain? boulton's group asked the same question
about pea (paterson et al., 1990) and seems to have fully
embraced the idea that pea is a neuromodulator of
catecholamine neurotransmission in the cns (boulton et al.,
1990).
contrary to this view baud et al. (1985) provided compelling
evidence that tyr and pea can act independently of da to
inhibit acetylcholine release in striatal slices. parker and
cubeddu (1988) reported observing effects of pea and
amph on da efflux, da uptake, and  xxxd2546xxx  binding.

362

d.k. grandy / pharmacology & therapeutics 116 (2007) 355–390

paterson (1993) showed that pea potentiates cortical neuron
responses to ne independent of any endogenous ne. the
ability of pea to modulate da neurotransmission in the
nigrostriatal pathway was reported by barroso and rodriguez
(1996). ishida et al. (2005) found that pea stimulates
acetylcholine release by activating glutamatergic signaling
pathways. more recently geracitano et al. (2004), federici
et al. (2005), and berretta et al. (2005) demonstrated that ta
depress gabab responses in dopaminergic neurons by
inhibiting g-betagamma-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels.
additional studies suggest that at high concentrations ta
interact and interfere with biogenic amine transporter function
in ways similar to amph and meth but different from da,
ne, cocaine, and methylphenidate (hirano et al., 1989; janssen
et al., 1999; mundorf et al., 1999; berry, 2004; sulzer et al.,
2005). classically then, the ta have been shown to inhibit da
uptake and to a lesser extent ne and 5-ht (horn & snyder,
1972; raiteri et al., 1977; dyck, 1983; bailey et al., 1987), as
well as exert an amph-like effect (janssen et al., 1999) on
presynaptic monoamine transporters, causing them to reverse
their normal direction of transport (stamford et al., 1986; parker
& cubeddu, 1988). this results in the displacement of da from
intracellular vesicles elevating cytoplasmic concentrations and
ultimately elevating nt concentrations in the synaptic space
(amara & sonders, 1998; sulzer et al., 2005).
in their review of the subject, burchett and hicks (2006)
suggest that when the classical actions of ta are considered
together with the recent discovery of vertebrate receptors
activated by ta (borowsky et al., 2001; bunzow et al., 2001)
the evidence suggests 4 kinds of ta activity in the cns: cotransmitters released with da, ne, and 5-ht; transmitters in
their own right with their own receptors; false transmitters at
da- and ne-selective receptors; and neuromodulators, hence
their name for these compounds: protean nt.
2.4.3. behavioral manifestations of trace amines
depending on the dose, pea is capable of producing
dramatic increases in animal behavior or significant decreases
in behavior. in rodents pea elicits amph-like behavior (hirano
et al., 1989; janssen et al., 1999) at doses of ∼ 50 mg/kg (i.p.)
characterized by hyperactivity, occasional walking backward,
rearing, sniffing, gnawing, and licking (boulton, 1982; dourish,
1982; lapin, 1996). at higher doses (75–100 mg/kg), repetitive,
stereotypical behaviors, predominate including “wet dog”
shaking, excessive grooming and head movement, seizures,
labored breathing, salivation, and straub (vertically erect) tail.
further evidence of important interactions between ta and
da signaling with behavioral consequences is the work of
barroso and rodriguez (1996). when pea (1.75 mg/kg) is
administered intravenously to rats with a unilateral 6-oh da
lesion of the nigrostriatal da system, they begin to display
rotation behavior within seconds ipsilateral (same as) to the
lesion.
in nonhuman primates pea (0.3–1.0 mg/kg), in the presence
of the mao-b inhibitors r-(−)-deprenyl or mdl 72974 (each
at 0.3 mg/kg), fully substitutes for an intramuscular injection of
meth (0.3 mg/kg) in squirrel monkeys trained to discriminate

meth from saline (bergman et al., 2001). such psychostimulant effects of pea are thought to be dependent upon intact
nigrostriatal and mesolimbic da pathways (boulton et al.,
1990).
the availability of mice that completely lack the da
transporter (dat; giros et al., 1996) provides an opportunity
to dissociate the behavioral, neurochemical, and molecular
effects of pea, and other ta as well, that are dat-independent
from those that are dat-dependent. when wild-type and datdeficient animals were administered pea at a dose that was
effective at producing hyperlocomotion in wild type mice
(50 mg/kg, i.p.) only the wild-type mice responded with a
transient elevation (6.5-fold) in striatal extracellular da levels,
as determined by microdialysis (sotnikova et al., 2004).
in behavioral experiments wild-type mice respond to pea
(50 mg/kg, i.p.) with a short-lived (10–15 min) burst of
hyperactivity compared to saline-injected controls. surprisingly,
mice genetically engineered to lack the dat display spontaneous hyperlocomotion in a novel environment, a response that is
suppressed by all doses (10, 30, 50, 70, 100 mg/kg) of pea
administered i.p. (giros et al., 1996). at the highest doses of
pea wild-type mice exhibit stereotypies including headweaving, padding, sniffing rearing, grooming, and licking whereas no
dose of pea produces stereotypies in mice lacking dat.
to explain these findings sotnikova et al. (2004) in a
follow-up report proposed that da-dependent locomotor
activity is probably influenced by a balance struck between
activity of stimulatory 5-ht1b and 5-ht2a receptors and
inhibitory 5-ht1a and 5-ht2c receptors (gainetdinov et al.,
1999; spielewoy et al., 2001; barr et al., 2004; powell et al.,
2004).
2.4.4. trace amines in human health and disease
with the availability of reliable quantitative methods for
determining ta content in tissues and fluids data quickly
accumulated on the abundance and tissue distribution of various
ta in healthy individuals as well as those afflicted with somatic
disorders (e.g., phenylketonuria, wolf & mosnaim, 1983; liver
failure, fischer & baldessarini, 1971); and mental ailments
(fischer et al., 1972; boulton, 1974; huebert & boulton, 1979;
boulton, 1980; wolf & mosnaim, 1983; boulton, 1988).
the results from these studies often, but not always,
replicated (anderson et al., 1984), correlated levels of pea,
tyr, tryp, or their metabolites in blood and/or urine with
methylphenidate and amph exposure (borison et al., 1975),
hypertension (andrew et al., 1993), and hepatic encephalopathy
(manghani et al., 1975) as well as mental conditions including
schizophrenia (boulton et al., 1967; vogel et al., 1967; faurbye,
1968; fischer et al., 1968; sandler & reynolds, 1976; zeller et
al., 1976; potkin et al., 1979; boulton, 1980, 1982; szymanski
et al., 1987; myojin et al., 1989; o'reilly et al., 1991; o'reilly
& davis, 1994; buckland et al., 1997), tourette's syndrome
(baker et al., 1993), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(adhd; baker et al., 1991; kusaga, 2002), migraine
(hannington, 1967; smith et al., 1970; sever, 1979; d'andrea
et al., 2003b) and other headache (aridon et al., 2004;
d'andrea et al., 2004), and depression (mosnaim et al., 1973;

d.k. grandy / pharmacology & therapeutics 116 (2007) 355–390

reynolds, 1979; sandler et al., 1980; chance et al., 1985; davis
& boulton, 1994; baker et al., 2000).
certain forms of depression are unresponsive to available
treatments and have been proposed to be manifestations of ta
insufficiency (mosnaim et al., 1973; wolf & mosnaim, 1983).
the development of ta-like enhancer substances similar to
selegiline (deprenyl), widely used in treating movement (e.g.,
parkinson's disease) and cognitive (e.g., alzheimer's disease)
deficits, remains an active area of research (shimazu & miklya,
2004; gaszner & miklya, 2006).
another anti-parkinson disease medication, l-dopa, affects
ta metabolism (edwards et al., 1981). interest in the possibility
that the ta play an important part in the etiology of this
condition (heller et al., 1976) as well as the beneficial and
adverse effects produced by l-dopa pharmacotherapy has
been rekindled by the discovery of receptors that are activated
by these biogenic amines (borowsky et al., 2001; bunzow et al.,
2001) and the work of mercuri, bernardi, and their colleagues
(geracitano et al., 2004; mercuri & bernardi, 2005)
many of the earliest attempts to link ta and human health
came at a time when the psychiatric and neuroscience
communities were awash in the paradigm-shifting realization
that small molecules, such as chlorpromazine, could produce
significant improvements in certain mentally ill individuals
(thuillier, 1999). encouraged by early successes substantial
effort went into developing small molecule-based medications
for treating cognitive deficits, psychosis, and mood disorders
that continues to this day.
of course the potential for altering mood and cognition
through pharmacologic means has long been appreciated by
humans (furst, 1972, 1976; booth, 1996). the use of naturally
occurring mind-altering, psychoactive compounds present in
certain plants (e.g., mescaline from the peyote cactus) and fungi
(e.g., psilocybin from mushrooms) has been ritualized for
millennia. most of the psychoactive principles extracted from
these natural sources are structurally related to pea and tryp
and have inspired the synthesis of a plethora of substituted
phenylethylamines and tryp with varying degrees of psychoactive potential (shulgin & shulgin, 1991, 1997).
the simple structure of pea has made it a natural point of
departure for many medicinal chemists. over the years their
efforts have led to the creation of numerous clinically useful
derivative compounds. arguably the most important of these
are the amph. not surprisingly amph and meth bind the
same cellular sites and display many of the same sympathomimetic properties as the naturally occurring ta (sulzer et al.,
2005). what is significantly different about them though is that
amph and meth produce profound psychomotor and
anorectic effects that are accompanied by a high abuse
potential in humans. in contrast, high doses of exogenous
pea are well-tolerated by healthy volunteers and do not posses
high abuse potential.
the disparate efficacies and diversity of effects produced by
such chemically similar molecules as pea and meth likely
reflects differences in their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. of these 2 the latter has recently become one
of the exciting revelations to come from the discovery of a

363

putative vertebrate ta receptor (tar), meth is a potent and
efficacious tar agonist (bunzow et al., 2001; reese et al.,
2007).
3. receptors for trace amines
3.1. historic context
the large body of biochemical, pharmacological, and
physiological evidence collected over the course of almost
100 years convincingly demonstrates the presence of endogenous ta in all species of invertebrates (de rome et al., 1980;
dudai, 1982; dudai & zvi, 1984; hashemzadeh et al., 1985;
guillen et al., 1989; degen et al., 2000; rex & komuniecki,
2002) and vertebrates that have been examined (molinoff &
axelrod, 1969, 1972; durden et al., 1973; philips et al., 1974a,
1974b; saavedra et al., 1974; boulton et al., 1975; juorio, 1976;
juorio & philips, 1976; juorio & roberston, 1977; philips et al.,
1978; reynolds et al., 1980; juorio & kazakoff, 1984; williams
et al., 1987; juorio & sloley, 1988; downer et al., 1993).
furthermore, pharmacologic manipulations (borison et al.,
1974, 1975; boulton, 1976a; philips & boulton, 1979; stoff et
al., 1984; boulton et al., 1990; juorio et al., 1991a, 1991b) and
lesioning studies (boulton et al., 1977; juorio & jones, 1981;
greenshaw et al., 1985; greenshaw et al., 1986; juorio &
greenshaw, 1986; juorio et al., 1987; juorio, 1988) significantly
influence ta turnover and levels with physiological (becuvillalobos, 1987; cheng et al., 1990; hirashima et al., 1999; lee
et al., 2003) and behavioral (dourish, 1982; lapin, 1996; rex et
al., 2004; suo et al., 2006) consequences.
the thesis that ta act as endogenous signaling molecules in
human brain as well as other organs is a logical one, reinforced
by the recognition that in animal models of drug-seeking
behavior ta are self-administered (shannon & degregorio,
1982; bergman et al., 2001) while in humans the chemically
related compounds mescaline, amph, and meth produce
intense intoxication, sensitization, and a profoundly altered
psychotic state (faurbye, 1968; furst, 1972, 1976; titeler et al.,
1988; sato, 1992; ujike & sato, 2004) in addition to their
cardiovascular and thermic effects.
however, for any molecule, including a ta, to achieve the
status of a bona fide nt several criteria must be met. of these
the principle requirements are that (1) an organism possesses the
biosynthetic and catabolic capabilities to produce and inactivate
the putative nt substance; (2) the putative nt must be found in
the terminals of neurons; (3) the putative nt must be stored in
vesicles and released upon stimulation; (4) once released the
putative nt must be capable of binding to a specific, saturable,
and functionally active receptive site that in turn couples to a
measurable biological effect; and (5) application of exogenously prepared nt substance mimics the biological effect(s) of the
endogenous material.
of the traditional ta, oct was the first to meet essentially all
of these requirements albeit in an invertebrate species (saavedra
& axelrod, 1976; axelrod & saavedra, 1977), including the
demonstration of “true” oct receptors (carpenter & gaubatz,
1974; arakowa et al., 1990). however, the existence of

364

d.k. grandy / pharmacology & therapeutics 116 (2007) 355–390

functional mammalian tar remained the subject of considerable debate until recently (borowsky et al., 2001; bunzow et al.,
2001).
since ta are present in every vertebrate and invertebrate
species that has been examined, it was anticipated by most of the
pioneers working in this area that tar would be pharmacologically defined and biochemically characterized apace with the
receptors for the biogenic amines da, ne, 5-ht, and his.
although this expectation was met in several species of
invertebrates the demonstration of membrane-bound receptors
specific for the ta proved much more challenging in
vertebrates. as no vertebrate tar candidate emerged with
each passing year, the initial excitement that accompanied the
prospect of establishing the ta as bona fide nt in vertebrates
began to wane and the concept that these ‘false’ transmitters
played primarily a neuromodulatory role gained widespread
acceptance. with the recent cloning and characterization of
vertebrate gpcr functionally activated by ta, this area of
research has been rejuvenated and efforts to define their
biological roles have a promising future.
3.2. trace amine binding sites
binding sites are similar to receptors in that both selectively
interact with ligands and at some concentration become
saturated. however, binding sites are importantly distinguished
from receptors in that no functional (i.e., biological/physiological) consequence of their interaction with ligand is implied.
the search for specific and saturable ta recognition sites in
brain can be traced back in the literature to the early 1970s when
baldessarini and vogt (1971) explored the uptake and
subcellular distribution of pea and tyr while boulton and
his colleagues, using 14c-pea, 14c-tyr, and 14c-tryp,
demonstrated the labeling of myelin containing “complexes”
present in rat brain homogenates associated with synaptosomes
(boulton et al., 1972; boulton & baker, 1975).
the first demonstration of specific and saturable binding sites
for 3h-pea was reported by hauger et al. (1982) using
homogenized rat forebrain by hauger et al. (1982). using
100 mm cold pea to define the nonspecific binding of the
labeled compound (3h-pea; ∼44 ci/mmol), these investigators
were able to perform a scatchard analysis and estimate the
number of pea binding sites (bmax = 1078 fmol/mg protein) and
determine a dissociation constant (kd = 55 nm). that the 3hpea was associating with sites composed at least partially of
protein was demonstrated by the ability of proteases and heat to
disrupt them.
with access to relatively high specific activity (∼ 32 ci/
mmol) 3 h-tyr, vaccari (1986) found that synaptosomal
membranes prepared from rat brain (e.g., striatum, hypothalamus, cortex, pons-medulla, and cerebellum) and incubated in the
presence of the mao inhibitor  xxxd2850xxx  (10 mm) bound 3htyr in a temperature-dependent, sodium ion-dependent, and
saturable manner with a low dissociation constant
(kd = ∼ 10 nm). besides tyr reserpine, da, and several da
reuptake inhibitors (e.g.,  xxxd2746xxx , methylphenidate, damph) were potent competitors of 3h-tyr binding. with

respect to da this profile was consistent with a presynaptic site
of interaction, a hypothesis supported by lesioning of the
nigrostriatal pathway (vaccari, 1986, 1993).
prior to the cloning of a rat gpcr activated by ta
(borowsky et al., 2001; bunzow et al., 2001), the presence of
saturable oct binding sites in membranes had only been
convincingly documented in several invertebrate species.
using 10 mm  xxxd2914xxx  to define nonspecific binding,
dudai (1982) and dudai and zvi (1984) demonstrated saturable
[3h]p-oct labeling of membrane preparations made from the
heads of d. melanogaster with a kd of 5–6 nm, while
hashemzadeh et al. (1985) found both high (kd = 1 nm) and
low (60 nm) affinity labeling in the light organ of the firefly
that was displaceable by 10 mm p-oct. in both species of fly,
the addition of guanosine-5′-triphosphate (gtp) significantly
reduced the number of [3h]p-oct binding sites providing the
first evidence in support of the hypothesis that insect tissues
possess functional oct gpcr. in their efforts to isolate an
oct receptor protein nathanson et al. (1989) took advantage
of the apparent high density of oct receptors in this tissue.
specific and saturable binding sites for the ta tryp, defined
in the presence of excess cold tryp, were first demonstrated in
rat brain membranes by kellar and cascio (1982) and perry
et al. (1982). soon thereafter the uneven distribution of specific
high affinity (kd = 1.5–5 nm) sites labeled by [3h]tryp were
also identified in other tissue homogenates (bruning &
rommelspacher, 1984; wood et al., 1984; cascio & kellar,
1986; martin et al., 1986; graham & langer, 1987) and sections
(kaulen et al., 1986; mccormack et al., 1986; perry, 1986).
taken together these studies were consistent with the
interpretation that tryp binding was likely associated with a
plasma membrane-bound site primarily located in synaptosomes but with a pattern of anatomic distribution distinct from
that of 5-ht (nguyen & juorio, 1989).
3.3. invertebrate trace amine-activated receptors
by the early 1970s it was becoming widely accepted, in
vertebrates at least, that many of the physiological consequences
of nt, such as da are mediated by membrane-bound receptive
proteins that coupled to and activated intracellular g proteins.
once activated these g proteins could directly modulate adenylyl
cyclase activity to stimulate or depress intracellular levels of
camp. as early as 1972, walker et al. (1972) had demonstrated
that species of snail possess neurons that are hyperpolarized by
oct due to an increased conductance of potassium, while
robertson and steele (1972) reported that insect nerve cord
phosphorylase activity is stimulated by both oct and camp.
oct responses were soon thereafter reported in species of
aplysia (saavedra et al., 1974).
that same year it was firmly established that oct stimulates
the accumulation of camp in insects. using homogenates and
intact preparations of thoracic ganglia from the cockroach
p. americana nathanson and greengard (1973) were able to
demonstrate the presence of an adenylyl cyclase that could be
stimulated by low doses of oct but was otherwise insensitive
to either da or 5-ht. compelling pharmacological evidence

d.k. grandy / pharmacology & therapeutics 116 (2007) 355–390

that oct-stimulated camp accumulation in the ventral nerve of
p. americana was receptor-mediated followed in 1976
(nathanson, 1976). in 1977, harmar and horn published that
cockroach brain contained an adenylyl cyclase that is sensitive
to oct.
in 1978 dougan and wade (dougan & wade, 1978)
published a report in which they had used the da receptor
antagonists clozapine and metoclopramide to demonstrate the
likelihood of oct receptors in the ventricle of the mollusk
tapes that are pharmacologically distinct from da receptors
present in the same tissue.
the following year bodnaryk discovered an oct-stimulated
adenylyl cyclase activity in the moth mamestra configurata
(bodnaryk, 1979a, 1979b). subsequently, the ability of low
oct concentrations to raise camp levels with a distinctive
pharmacological profile was reported in preparations of
d. melanogaster heads (uzzan and dudai, 1982) and flight
muscle of locusta migratoria (lafon-cazal & bockaert, 1985).
the notion that oct's effect on invertebrate tissue
preparations might be simple was dispelled when evans
published pharmacological evidence of what appeared to be
multiple distinct receptor subtypes in the locust extensor-tibiae
muscle (evans, 1981). he proposed 3 subtypes and organized
them into 2 major classes. oct-1 receptors coupled to increases
in intracellular calcium fluxes, a similar physiological response
displayed by other insects (jahagirdar et al., 1987). oct-2
receptors were of 2 pharmacologically distinguishable subtypes,
2a and 2b, but both coupled to increases in camp (evans,
1981, 1984; evans & robb, 1993).
based on studies of oct's effects on intact locust neurons
roeder and colleagues proposed the existence of another class
of oct receptor, oa3, that also coupled to the stimulation of
camp production (roeder & gewecke, 1990; roeder, 1992;
roeder & nathanson, 1993; roeder, 1995; roeder et al., 1995).
however, due to its similarities with oct-2a receptors it
eventually came to be considered a member of the oct-2 class
and was designated oct-2c.
concomitant with the more traditional pharmacologic
approach to studying receptors in the 1970s and 1980s several
powerful biochemical and molecular biological techniques were
being developed that would revolutionize receptor research.
one of these allowed investigators to reliably determine the
sequence of almost any polypeptide as long as a few picomoles
(10− 12 mol) of it were available for analysis. at the same time
advances in solid-phase nucleotide chemistry were making the
efficient synthesis of custom oligonucleotides, or “oligos,”
routine and the cost affordable to most laboratories.
the ability to sequence proteins and then custom design
an oligonucleotide meant that if one could obtain a partial
receptor amino acid sequence then a sequence of possible
codons could be deduced and used to design an oligonucleotide specific for the mrna, cdna, or gene from which that
protein was derived. such an oligo would serve as a powerful
tool in the identification of putative receptor-encoding cdnas
or genes using strategies based on nucleic acid hybridization.
by subjecting these putative receptor-encoding clones to
automated dna sequencing and computer-aided analyses,

365

the most promising of them could be quickly and reliably
identified. the chosen clones could then be heterologously
expressed in cells that typically lack them. thus, for the first
time, it became possible to characterize a receptor protein in an
environment far less complex than a whole tissue homogenate.
in spite of the overwhelming evidence that oct receptors
exist as true proteinaceous entities they proved difficult to
characterize biochemically because of their relatively low
abundance and functional liability during purification. furthermore, the ligands that activate them are agonists of relatively
low affinity. in an attempt to overcome these technical hurdles
nathanson developed a potent oct receptor agonist, nc-5z,
that could be photoactivated and irreversibly bound to a
glycoprotein in the light organ of the firefly photimus pyralis
in a manner expected of oct receptor protein (nathanson,
1989; nathanson & kaugars, 1989). from this nc-5z-labeled
material a short stretch of n-terminal amino acid sequence was
determined (nathanson et al., 1989). this same photoaffinity
reagent allowed roeder and nathanson (1994) to identify a
protein with similar biochemical and pharmacological characteristics in the desert locust schistocerca gregaria. it was
understandably a great disappointment when these investigators came to realize that the peptide fragment they had so
painstakingly obtained did not arise from an oct receptor in
spite of their best efforts to avoid artifactual labeling.
the distinction of being the first to report the successful
cloning and expression of an invertebrate tar goes to arakawa
et al. (1990). with a clone cdna of the human beta2 adrenergic
receptor as their hybridization probe these investigators
screened a d. melanogaster genomic library under “low
stringency” conditions that allow nucleic acids to form stable
duplexes in spite of extensive mismatched base-pairing. the
hybridizing dnas were sequenced and in 1 reading frame a
polypeptide was deduced whose amino acid sequence was
homologous to several mammalian adrenergic receptors. a
probe containing part of this putative receptor sequence was
made and used to identify a full-length cdna in a library
constructed from drosophila head mrna.
the longest open reading frame in their cdna coded for a
protein that shared extensive sequence homology, sites for posttranslational modification, such as glycosylation, and a similar
hydropathy profile with several vertebrate receptors that are
activated by biogenic amines including da, epi, ne, and 5-ht.
however, this putative receptor sequence shared the highest
degree of sequence identity with vertebrate  xxxg831xxx  adrenergic
receptors.
the availability of a new cdna provides a sensitive and
precise means by which to investigate the tissue distribution of
its corresponding mrna. interestingly, this particular putative
receptor-coding sequence was exclusively expressed in the head
of drosophila.
the challenge confronting the investigator who has cloned a
novel nucleotide sequence is figuring out what its product does.
in the case of arakawa et al. their thinking was guided
considerably by the extensive homology between their putative
receptor and other gpcr that had already been cloned. however,
to establish that the protein is a receptor its pharmacological and

366

d.k. grandy / pharmacology & therapeutics 116 (2007) 355–390

functional attributes have to be characterized. since chinese
hamster ovary (cho) cells are easy to culture and do not express
the drosophila mrna under study, this cell line was chosen to
be co-transfected with 2 plasmids: a eukaryotic expression vector
containing the putative receptor-coding sequence and a plasmid
carrying a drug resistance gene. clonal populations derived from
drug-resistant cho cells maintained under  xxxd2191xxx  selection
that expressed high levels of the putative receptor mrna were
identified by northern blotting, expanded in size, and used in
subsequent membrane binding assays.
given the extensive sequence conservation between the
putative drosophila “orphan” receptor and the  xxxg831xxx  adrenergic receptors binding studies with [3h]yohimbine and a series of
unlabeled nt agonists and antagonists were conducted. in
addition, since there was considerable evidence for the
existence of oct-coupled adenylyl cyclases in several
invertebrate species, camp accumulation was also investigated.
despite a higher than expected affinity for [3h]yohimbine, a
slightly higher affinity for syn, and the lack of any tyrbinding data, the authors concluded they had cloned the cdna
for a g protein-coupled oct receptor of the type 1 subtype
based on the rank order of affinity it displays for noncatecholic
phenylethylamines and its ability to couple oct exposure to the
inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp production in a
pertussis toxin-sensitive manner.
although confident in assigning their new receptor to the
oct-1 class, the authors noted there were important discrepancies in the effective concentration of oct observed versus
expected. also, the relative potencies of some compounds at the
drosophila oct-1 receptor were not the same as had been
reported for the prototypical oct-1 in the locust flight muscle
preparation.
in the discussion of possible explanations for their observations, the authors identify a number of important parameters that must still be considered when attempting to draw
conclusions from studies involving receptors expressed in an
atypical environment. paramount among these influences
are the nature of the cellular milieu in which the putative
receptor is expressed and the number of receptors that are
actually expressed.
six months later, saudou et al. (1990) reported the success of
their efforts to clone a drosophila oct receptor using
degenerate oligonucleotide probes based on conserved amino
acid residues present in the highly conserved, putative
transmembrane (tm) domains vi and vii of several biogenic
amine responsive vertebrate receptors. the cdna they
identified turned out to code for a gpcr identical to the one
reported by arakawa et al. (1990). membranes prepared from
cos-7 cells transiently expressing the putative receptor
displayed a similar affinity (kd = ∼ 4.45 nmol) for [ 3 h]
yohimbine and a comparable competition binding profile.
however, to their credit, saudou et al. included tyr in their
binding assays and found that it was about 30 times more potent
in displacing [ 3 h]yohimbine than was oct. the stable
expression of their clone in cultures of mouse nih-3t3 cells
allowed them to functionally characterize the receptor which
was found to inhibit  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp when exposed

to tyr (ec50 = 2.4 mum) and oct (ec50 = 35 mum). based on
their pharmacological and physiological findings, the authors
suggested that the receptor they had expressed was in fact more
appropriately referred to as a tyr receptor.
though the authors acknowledged there was substantially
more experimental evidence in support of insect receptors for
oct, they pointed out the literature was not silent with respect
to the possible existence of invertebrate tyr receptors. in fact,
there were several compelling pieces of evidence that supported
the hypothesis that tyr and oct played physiologically
distinct roles. as examples they cited the observation that oct
can stimulate glyconeolysis in cockroach nerve cord and fat
bodies whereas tyr causes a decrease (downer, 1979). in
addition, the tissue distribution of oct differs from tyr
(maxwell et al., 1978; juorio & sloley, 1988) with the latter
more abundant than the former in insect brains.
the availability of a cdna coding for a drosophila oct/
tyr receptor gave evans and colleagues an opportunity to
further explore its pharmacology and physiology in isolation
and in different cellular milieus (robb et al., 1994). interestingly, these authors found that in competition binding assays
pea was 10 times more potent than tyr at displacing [3h]
yohimbine binding from oct/tyr-containing cho membranes while tyr was about 2 orders of magnitude more potent
than oct. the same rank order was found in the functional
assay where they inhibited  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp production in cho cells. however, in contrast to the differences they
displayed with respect to potency in competition binding and
camp assays, the effects of tyr and oct on the level of
intracellular calcium in transfected cho cells were insensitive
to pertussis toxin and nearly identical in their response
demonstrating that the same receptor protein was capable of
interacting with multiple g proteins and multiple signaling
pathways in the same cell. in conclusion, these authors
suggested, based on its pharmacological profile, that this
particular oct/tyr receptor was most likely a drosophila
homologue of the locust oct-2/skeletal muscle class (evans,
1981, 1984; arakawa et al., 1990).
soon thereafter davis's group reported their discovery of
oamb, a novel drosophila oct gpcr-coding cdna
enriched in mushroom bodies. they based this assignment on
the putative receptor's deduced amino acid sequence, its unique
tissue distribution, its pharmacology, and its distinctive ability
to couple to the stimulation of camp production and
intracellular calcium mobilation in transfected drosophila s2
and human embryonic kidney (hek) cells (han et al., 1998).
the ec50 for oct-stimulated camp accumulation was 190 nm
while tyr appeared to be a partial agonist with an ec50 of
∼100-fold less potent than oct. in the presence of oct,
calcium mobilization was stimulated in oamb-expressing
hek cells. the restriction of oamb's expression to structures
associated with drosophila's olfactory system together with
evidence for biogenic amines influencing insect behavior
prompted these investigators to conclude that the receptor
they identified would be involved in olfactory conditioning
presaging the finding of farooqui et al. (2003) in the honeybee
and the recent speculation that receptors for ta expressed in the

d.k. grandy / pharmacology & therapeutics 116 (2007) 355–390

olfactory epithelium of the mouse may recognize odorants in
urine that serve as social cues (liberles & buck, 2006).
in the course of pursuing their interest in determining a
biological function for tyr in drosophila distinct from oct,
kutsukake et al. (2000) demonstrated that they had differing
effects on excitatory junction potentials (ejp) in dorsal acute
muscles with oct concentration dependently enhancing, while
tyr depressed, the amplitude of neurally evoked ejp. these
observations were extended by nagaya et al. (2002) who
studied the actions of tyr and oct in a drosophila mutant
known as honoka (hono). this mutant fly carries a p-element
inserted 100 bases upstream of the oct/tyr receptor gene
cloned by arakawa et al. (1990) and saudou et al. (1990). the
presence of this p-element not only interferes with the
expression of this gene but also their normal avoidance
response to various odorants. interestingly, oct's effect on
stimulating larval ejp remained intact in wild-type and mutant
larvae, whereas tyr's inhibitory effect on ejp was completely
absent from hono larvae, thus demonstrating almost unequivocally the existence of 2 separate receptor entities with distinct
physiological properties.
in addition to providing the means by which to further
characterize drosophila oct/tyr gpcr, these clones served
as nucleic acid hybridization probes that were used to identify
and isolate homologous receptor sequences from several
invertebrate species (vanden broeck et al., 1995; von
nickisch-rosenegk et al., 1996; gerhardt et al., 1997a,
1997b; reale et al., 1997; baxter & barker, 1999; blenau et
al., 2000; chang et al., 2000; poels et al., 2001; rex &
komuniecki, 2002; farooqui et al., 2003; grohmann et al.,
2003; ohta et al., 2003; bischof & enan, 2004; farooqui et al.,
2004; balfanz et al., 2005; molaei et al., 2005; mustard et al.,
2005; rex et al., 2005; dacks et al., 2006). these clones have
also been instrumental in identifying the important structural
features that participate in the binding of ligand and coupling of
the receptor to its effectors (chatwin et al., 2003; huang, 2003;
ohta et al., 2004).
given the extensive evidence for oct stimulation of camp
production in invertebrates and the likely involvement of at least
3 distinct receptors in the process (evans, 1981, 1993) it was
surprising to many that cdnas for only 2 invertebrate octstimulating receptors had been cloned by the end of the
millennium: 1 from drosophila (han et al., 1998) and the other
from aplysia (chang et al., 2000).
perhaps no one was more aware of this fact than p.d. evans.
not surprisingly then, as the drosophila genome became more
completely characterized, evans and his colleagues scoured the
databases for putative gpcr-coding open reading frames that
predicted polypeptides more closely related to vertebrate betaadrenergic receptors. the fruit of these labors was the
identification of 3 candidate receptors that bestowed on cells
expressing them a greater sensitivity to oct than tyr in terms
of stimulating the production of camp (maqueira et al., 2005)
and ultimately resulted in a new classification scheme for
invertebrate oct receptors (evans & maqueira, 2005).
the success of this strategy underscores the experimental
power of being able to express a putative receptor at will

367

thereby making direct pharmacological and physiological
analyses of expected (evans, 1980, 1981) and unexpected
novel receptor subtypes (venter et al., 1988) more straightforward, with certain limitations, as mentioned above (hiripi et al.,
1994; hirashima et al., 2003; lee et al., 2003; rex et al., 2004;
cazzamali et al., 2005; ohta et al., 2005).
3.4. discovery of vertebrate trace amine-associated receptors
in the pregenomic era of molecular neuroscience the cloning
of rare vertebrate transcripts, in particular those that code for
novel gpcr, was in many ways an art form whose practioners
eagerly embraced the latest molecular technique while participating in the development of new ones. the most successful of
these efforts were those that began with a firm biological
foundation. typically this would consist of well-documented
observations of pharmacological agents producing physiological and/or behavioral effects that could not be explained by
known mechanisms. not surprisingly then, given their long
history and importance in terms of human health, receptors
selective for the putative biogenic amine nt were early targets
of great interest to molecular neuroscientists.
in the years before the advent of molecular biology,
traditional biochemical strategies used successfully to isolate
soluble proteins (e.g., enzymes) failed, for the most part, to
yield purified receptor proteins. among the explanations
suggested to explain this outcome are the relatively small size
of gpcr, their limited abundance, and their hydrophobic
nature. hard won, some receptor protein sequence information
eventually began to emerge, which led to the successful cloning
of cdnas and genes for the opsins (nathans & hogness, 1983,
1984; nathans et al., 1986) and the hamster beta2-adrenergic
receptor (dixon et al., 1986; kobilka et al., 1987). even with the
limited number of examples available at the time molecular
neurobiologists closely following these developments latched
on immediately to the remarkable extent of amino acid sequence
and structural conservation, in particular the presence of 7
hydrophobic, putative tm domains, shared by these integral
membrane proteins. the hypothesis to emerge from this
observation was: all membrane-bound receptors that activate
second messenger systems by way of stimulating g protein
activity are structurally related.
this prediction was immediately put to the test experimentally in the form of “cloning by homology.” through the efforts
of many individual laboratories, this approach rapidly yielded
cdna and genomic clones for receptors of the major biogenic
amine nt. aligning the sequences of these receptors led to the
construction of families whose members share extensive
sequence with one another. in addition to identifying receptors
predicted by years of physiology and pharmacology, this socalled “orphan" receptors whose endogenous ligands have yet
to be identified.
3.4.1. cloning of a rat trace amine receptor
3.4.1.1. borowsky et al. in the course of their efforts to
identify additional members of the 5-ht receptor family,

368

d.k. grandy / pharmacology & therapeutics 116 (2007) 355–390

scientists at synaptic pharmaceutical corporation (paramus,
nj) designed degenerate oligonucleotides complementary to
conserved 5-ht receptor sequences located in putative tm
domains vi and vii. these primers were used in polymerase
chain reactions (pcr) to amplify similar sequences from a rat
genomic library (borowsky et al., 2001). the nucleotide
sequence of one of the resulting amplification products
contained an open reading frame that predicted a novel protein
not present in the databases of the day. this polypeptide
fragment was between 42% and 48% identical to sequences in
the  xxxg1117xxx , da d2, and beta-adrenergic receptors. borowsky
et al. used this fragment of genomic sequence to eventually
obtain a full-length clone from rat testes cdna. in an attempt to
discover an agonist for this orphan receptor the sequence was
expressed in xenopus oocytes along with mrna coding for the
cystic fibrosis transporter regulator (cftr), a chloride channel
that is activated by camp.
with this functional assay, borowsky et al. screened a large
panel of compounds and found that among them 100 mum oct,
and to lesser extent da, and 5-ht evoked significant inward
currents only in oocytes that had been injected with the mrna
produced from their novel cdna. this finding led them to try
tyr which they found to be almost 20 times more potent than
oct. taken together these data suggested that this orphan
receptor was activated by ta and so the authors referred to it
thereafter as  xxxg2239xxx .
3.4.1.2. bunzow et al. with the cloning of the da  xxxg656xxx 
(bunzow et al., 1989), the race was on to clone the da d1
receptor, the second pharmacologically and physiologically
defined receptor for da. in the course of their efforts to clone
this receptor, scientists working at oregon health and science
university (portland, or) developed a set of degenerate
oligonulceotide pcr primers based on conserved amino acid
sequences found in putative tm domains iii and vi of several
catecholamine gpcr. subsequent to their use in the successful
cloning of rat and human  xxxg655xxx  cdnas and genes (zhou
et al., 1990), these primers were employed in a search for
additional gpcrs that might be activated by da or other
related biogenic amines.
to this end the grandy laboratory used these primers in
reverse transcriptase-pcr (rt-pcr) to amplify cdna templates they had prepared from a panel of cell lines derived from
vertebrate peripheral tissues known to receive sympathetic
innervation or be sites of catecholamine synthesis. one of the
cell lines screened in this way, designated arj42 (american
type culture collection, atcc), was derived from a rat
pancreatic tumor. when bunzow et al. (2001) used their
degenerate primers in a rt-pcr with mrna prepared from
arj42 as the template, they amplified a cdna fragment whose
nucleotide sequence predicted a novel polypeptide most closely
related to gpcrs known to be activated by catecholamines.
efforts to express the full-length rat receptor-coding clone
in a number of cellular backgrounds were frustrated for
many years until it was determined that this receptor was
primarily localized in the cytoplasm. others had shown that
modifying a gpcr's amino terminal domain can improve its

cell surface expression (guan et al., 1992). consequently,
bunzow et al. added a 16-amino acid signal sequence from
the influenza hemagglutinin virus followed by an 8-amino
acid m1-“flag” epitope and a “metgly” spacer to the nterminus of their putative receptor's cdna. this modified
sequence was then cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector
containing a drug resistance marker and transiently expressed
in hek293 and cos-7 cells. under  xxxg418xxx  selection these cells
gave rise to populations that stably expressed orphan receptor
immunoreactivity.
although the anatomic distribution of the putative receptor's
mrna did not provide insight regarding the nature of its
endogenous ligand, the deduced amino acid sequence did.
consequently, based on the extensive conservation found
between the novel sequence and catecholamine receptors,
bunzow et al. assembled a large panel of compounds and began
screening them for activity in a functional assay that monitored
drug-induced changes in camp. in this functional assay 10 mum
da was able to elevate camp production but tyr and pea
were considerably more potent with nanomolar concentrations
as efficacious as 10 mum  xxxd1742xxx . subsequently they found that
tryp, syn, and oct were also more potent than da but less
potent than either tyr or pea, in that order. the pharmacological profile of this functional activity was interpreted by
these investigators as being consistent with that of a tar and
hence it was named  xxxg2239xxx .
an extensive structure activity profiling effort revealed that
the rat  xxxg2239xxx  was unusual in that it can be activated by a wide
assortment of compounds, some of which were traditionally
considered to be biologically inactive products of catecholamine metabolism (e.g., 3-methoxytyramine). equally thought
provoking was their demonstration that the synthetic phenylethylamine amph is a potent full agonist at heterologously
expressed rat  xxxg2239xxx . this observation was recently extended by
reese et al. (2007) who reported that s(+)-meth is a full and
potent  xxxg2239xxx  agonist with ec50 values of 0.89, 0.92, and
4.44 mum for rat, mouse, and the human-rat chimeric receptors,
respectively (see below). reese et al. (2007) also showed that
pea is a potent and full agonist at each species of  xxxg2239xxx , and
that tyr is a full agonist for the rodent receptors but only a
partial agonist at the human-rat chimera.
while the manuscript by bunzow et al. (2001) was under
review, the findings of borowsky et al. (2001) were published.
a comparison of both group's nucleotide and deduced amino
acid sequences revealed that they were one and the same
receptor.
3.4.2. cloning of a human trace amine-activated receptor
borowsky et al. (2001) and bunzow et al. (2001) were well
aware of the considerable interest there would be in the
identification of a human homologue to the rat tar.
consequently, both groups pursued and reported cloning a
human tar homologue. when the putative human  xxxg2239xxx  was
co-expressed with cftr in xenopus oocytes, borowsky et al.
(2001) demonstrated the activation of an inward chloride
current in response to 100 nm tyr. the physiological and
pharmacological characterization of this protein was then

d.k. grandy / pharmacology & therapeutics 116 (2007) 355–390

extended using cos-7 cells that transiently expressed the
human  xxxg2239xxx  clone. pea, tyr, and, to a lesser extent,
oct and da stimulated the production of camp in these cells.
furthermore, their membranes displayed saturable and high
affinity binding of [3h]tyr that could be displaced in the rank
order: pea ntyr n da n oct n trp.
due to difficulty establishing a population of tissue culture
cells that stably expressed the human receptor clone bunzow et
al. (2001) were unable to pharmacologically or functionally
characterize their human  xxxg2239xxx . interestingly, they were able to
overcome this problem using a recombinant  xxxg2239xxx  receptor that
consisted of human sequences with the exception of short
stretches at the n-terminus, c-terminus, and in third intracellular loop. in these places the human sequences were replaced
with the corresponding rat  xxxg2239xxx  sequences. the design of this
chimera was intended to maintain all of the human putative tm
and the proposed ligand binding domain (kratochwil et al.,
2005). when a line of hek cells that stably express this
construct was generated and characterized, it displayed
pharmacological and physiological profiles more like that of
cells stably expressing the mouse  xxxg2239xxx  with pea being a more
potent agonist than tyr (lindemann et al., 2005; lindemann
& hoener, 2005), in contrast to the report of borowsky et al.
(2001). recently, bunzow, reese, and grandy have found that
meth is a potent and full agonist of transiently expressed wildtype human  xxxg2239xxx  heterologously expressed in hek cells
(unpublished observations).
3.4.3. cloning of a mouse trace amine-activated receptor
in their original paper, the synaptic scientists reported the
cloning of a mouse brain cdna by virtue of the sequence
identity it shared with rat  xxxg2239xxx  (borowsky et al., 2001).
although they did not report the characterization of the protein
coded by this clone, they successfully used it to begin mapping
the anatomic distribution of the receptor's mrna in mouse
brain.
hybridization of an antisense  xxxg2239xxx  riboprobe in tissue
sections suggests that the mrna is expressed in several brain
regions including the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb, the
arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area,
locus coeruleus, purkinje cells in the cerebellum, and ventral
horn of the spinal column. in the report by wolinsky et al. (in
press) a more complete pharmacological description of the
synaptic mouse trace amine-associated receptor (taar) 1
clone transiently expressed in hek293 cells is presented.
grandy's laboratory also cloned the mouse  xxxg2239xxx  and stably
expressed it in hek293 cells. with this cell line reese et al.
(2007) demonstrated that it displays a characteristic pharmacologic profile with respect to camp production in response to the
stereoisomers of amph and meth (see below).
3.4.4. cloning of a nonhuman
primate trace amine-activated receptor
the cloning of a nonhuman primate tar was reported for
the rhesus monkey by miller and madras (2002). relying on
human tar sequence information oligonucleotide primers
were designed and used to amplify rhesus genomic dna by

369

pcr. nucleotide sequencing confirmed that the amplified
product was the rhesus orthologue of human  xxxg2239xxx / xxxg2239xxx . in
2005 xie et al. (xie et al., 2005) reported the cloning of the
rhesus ta4 receptor and the distribution of both  xxxg2239xxx / xxxg2239xxx 
and ta4 transcripts in rhesus brain. in the paper that followed,
miller et al. (2005) demonstrated the transient expression of the
rhesus  xxxg2239xxx  in hek293 cells. aware that ligand activation of
rat and human  xxxg2239xxx  results in the stimulation of camp
production, miller and colleagues developed a camp response
element-luciferase (cre-luc) reporter assay to monitor the
stimulation of rhesus  xxxg2239xxx . in spite of an issue with high
background levels of luminescence, tyr and pea could be
shown to produce a response only in those cells cotransfected
with receptor and cre-luc constructs.
an attempt to convincingly demonstrate specific [3h]pea
labeling of rhesus  xxxg2239xxx -expressing hek293 cells or their
homogenates proved difficult to achieve in spite of employing
multiple buffering systems with and without sodium. this
outcome was likely due to a combination of factors including
low levels of receptor expression, high nonspecific binding of
labeled pea, and the fact that the ligand is an agonist. the
development of a robust filtration-binding assay is likely going
to require a selective  xxxg2239xxx  antagonist labeled to high specific
activity.
familiar with the observation by bunzow et al. (2001) and
borowsky et al. (2001) that the majority of  xxxg2239xxx  immunoreactivity is intracellular, miller et al. (2005) constructed and
expressed a recombinant rhesus  xxxg2239xxx  expression vector that
covalently coupled the receptor's n-terminus to enhanced green
fluorescent protein (egfp). in the cre-luc assay this construct
still appeared to confer pea sensitivity to cells that transiently
express it albeit the response was notably less than with wildtype receptors. confocal fluorescence microscopy of cells
transfected with the egfp-rhesus  xxxg2239xxx  chimera revealed that
most of the fluorescence was intracellular.
3.4.5. zebra fish trace amine-associated receptors
it is often the case that comparative physiological and
phylogenetic approaches provide important insights on biological function. with this long-term objective in mind gloriam et
al. (2005a, 2005b) undertook a computer-assisted scan of the
published vertebrate genomes with the intention of identifying
every human  xxxg2239xxx -like sequence present in humans,
mice, rats, and 2 species of teleost, fugu (takifugu rubripes) and
zebra fish (danio rerio).
unexpectedly these efforts revealed the genome of zebra fish
to have experienced a very large expansion in its repertoire of
tar sequences compared to all others. based on sequence
analyses alone, 57 putative tar were identified as were another
40 containing the hallmarks associated with pseudogenes (i.e.,
premature stop codons interrupting the reading frame). to date,
none of these putative zebra fish tar sequences have been
shown to be expressed in vivo nor have any of them been
validated in vitro, pharmacologically or physiologically. however, the very fact that the genome of danio contains
orthologues of the human and rodent tar provides a
compelling rationale for further use of this model organism in

370

d.k. grandy / pharmacology & therapeutics 116 (2007) 355–390

efforts ultimately understand the biological role(s) of the ta in
humans.
3.4.6. a comment on nomenclature
as the number of laboratories characterizing these receptors
grew, so did the number of related genes reported in the
literature. it soon became apparent that a uniform nomenclature
would be preferable to the confusing literature that was
emerging. at the same time it was being realized that other
members of this family displayed very different pharmacological profiles than  xxxg2239xxx / xxxg2239xxx . as a consequence lindemann et
al. (2005) proposed a naming algorithm based solely on the
genomic and phylogenetic relationships between members of
this large receptor gene family. importantly, this algorithm
implies nothing about the pharmacology or physiology of a
particular taar. beginning with the receptor gene whose
physical position defines one end of the chromosomal region
that contains the entire family as a contiguous cluster in
humans, mice, and rats  xxxg2239xxx / xxxg2239xxx  becomes taar1 (lindemann et al., 2005). this convention has been accepted by the
human genome organization gene nomenclature committee
and has been adopted throughout the remainder of this review.
4. biology of vertebrate trace amine-associated receptors
4.1. expression of vertebrate trace amine-associated receptors
one strength of the molecular pharmacological approach to
the characterization of gpcr is the ability to establish
immortalized, clonal cell lines whose cytoplasmic milieus
support the functional coupling of stably expressed, heterologous receptors. such model cell lines not only provide an
endless supply of the receptor to be studied but also control cells
transfected with the empty expression vector.
4.1.1. in vitro expression
the stable in vitro expression of the vertebrate taar has
proved to be a challenge. from the first it was difficult to
reliably express any taar clone in tissue culture in spite of the
fact that a number of human, rodent, and nonhuman primate cell
types were tested.
after repeated attempts failed to demonstrate coupling of any
second messenger system to their transfected receptor bunzow
et al. (2001) engineered a rat taar1 expression construct such
that the receptor's n-terminus carried an epitope tag. the
confocal images immediately provided a possible explanation
for their inability to functionally couple the receptor to a
signaling pathway: the immunoreactivity was essentially all
intracellular (bunzow et al., 2001).
based on this information these investigators engineered
another expression vector that provided the nascent taar1
with a cleavable signal sequence; a modification that had been
previously used to augment the expression of some gpcr
(guan et al., 1992). this modified form of the rat receptor
achieved some stable cell surface expression in hek293 cells
and responded to various ta with an increase in camp. still,
the majority of the immunoreactivity appeared to be in the

cytoplasm (bunzow et al., 2001). borowsky et al. (2001) also
commented that their  xxxg2239xxx  was predominantly localized in the
cytoplasm of the cos-7 cells transiently expressing it.
eventually grandy's laboratory also succeeded in establishing
a hek293 cell line that stably expresses the mouse taar1.
however, all attempts by grandy's laboratory to stably express
the human taar1 in tissue culture were unsuccessful. they
overcame this inconvenience by expressing a hybrid receptor
consisting of mostly human sequence but whose n-terminus,
c-terminus, and third intracellular loop were replaced with the
corresponding rat sequences. this particular chimeric design
was chosen to preserve the proposed ligand binding pocket
formed by the juxtaposition of the 7 putative tm. interestingly,
the pharmacological profile of this chimeric receptor resembled
that of the mouse taar1 more than the rat (lindemann et al.,
2005).
recently a few laboratories have reported the success of brute
force approaches to establishing cell lines that stably express the
wild type human taar1 (navarro et al., 2006; wainscott et al.,
2006). unfortunately these rare successes have yet to shed much
light on the molecular determinants of human taar1
expression. it is hoped that the identification of cell lines that
express taar endogenously, such as arj42 and rin 5, will
provide additional opportunities to crack the expression enigma.
more widespread success has been reported with transient
expression (borowsky et al., 2001; miller et al., 2005; liberles
& buck, 2006) although assays using these preparations
typically suffer from low signal to noise ratios and variable
receptor densities since the proportion of cells expressing the
receptor varies from transfection to transfection. given these
limitations the experience of liberles and buck (2006) is
particularly remarkable since they apparently expressed all 15
mouse genes identified by lindemann et al. (2005). interestingly, transient expression of the epitope-tagged rat ta2
(taar4 according to the revised nomenclature of lindemann
et al., 2005; borowsky et al., 2001) and the rhesus monkey
 xxxg2239xxx  (taar1 according to the revised nomenclature of
lindemann et al., 2005; miller et al., 2005) recapitulate the
intracellular distribution observed by bunzow et al. (2001) in
hek293 cells stably expressing rat  xxxg2239xxx .
4.1.2. in vivo expression
determination of the anatomic distribution of the taar is a
work in progress that will take considerable time to complete.
this situation is largely a technical one because low levels of
taar mrnas are expressed, members of this extensive family
share considerable stretches of sequence, and it is inherently
difficult to generate antibodies against any gpcr.
borowsky et al. (2001) using quantitative rt-pcr found
evidence for taar1 in human brain tissue and several
peripheral tissues including stomach, kidney, lung, small
intestine, liver, pancreas, prostate, skeletal muscle, and spleen.
transcripts for taar 6, taar8, and taar 9 (formerly ta4,
ta5, and ta3, respectively) were also detected by this method
in the kidney. a systematic survey of taar1's mrna
distribution throughout the mouse brain was conducted using
antisense riboprobes complementary to mouse taar1. strong

d.k. grandy / pharmacology & therapeutics 116 (2007) 355–390

hybridization signals were found in numerous brain structures
including the olfactory bulb and others rich in monoamineproducing neurons (i.e., ventral tegmental area, da; locus
coeruleus, ne; dorsal raphe, 5-ht).
efforts by the grandy laboratory to characterize the
distribution of taar1 in rat tissues by northern blotting and
in situ hybridization were unsuccessful, most likely because of
low expression of its mrna. the more sensitive method of rtpcr was successfully employed to amplify taar1 sequences
from oligo-dt-primed rna prepared from several brain regions
and peripheral tissues. most notably the highest level of taar1
expression was found in the olfactory bulb, nucleus accumbens,
olfactory tubercle, prefrontal cortex, ventraltegmental/substantia nigra, cerebellum and pons. of the peripheral tissues
examined highest levels of expression were found in the liver,
kidney, gastrointestinal tract, spleen, pancreas, and heart.
recently, the expression of mrna for taar1, taar6,
taar8, and taar9 (formerly  xxxg2239xxx , ta4, ta5, and ta3,
respectively) in human leukocytes was demonstrated by rtpcr while hplc-coupled electrochemical detection revealed
the presence of tyr, oct, and syn in platelets (d'andrea et
al., 2003a, 2003b). vanti et al. (2003) find expression of the
human taar9 gene in pituitary and skeletal muscle. chiellini et
al. (2007) reported that mrna extracted from rat heart
contained transcripts for taar1, taar2, taar3, taar4,
and taar8a that could be amplified by rt-pcr using
oligonucleotide primers specific for individual taars.
in an interesting recent study liberles and buck (2006)
surprisingly failed to detect taar1 transcripts in mouse brain
or olfactory epithelium. however, they did report finding
transcripts for each of the remaining mouse taars in olfactory
neurons. further analysis of tissue sections subjected to dual
labeling suggests each taar subtype is expressed independently of all other taars and odorant receptors. the surprising
discrepancy between the reports by liberles and buck (2006)
and borowsky et al. (2001) and bunzow et al. (2001) remains to
be resolved and underscores the technical difficulties associated
with studying this family of receptors.

371

although transient expression has been reported for many
members of the family (borowsky et al., 2001; bunzow et al.,
2001; liberles & buck, 2006), cells that stably express
heterologous taar receptors have been difficult to establish.
the identification of cell lines that “naturally” express members
of the taar family would be one way to overcome this
obstacle.
unfortunately, one of the frustrations encountered when
working with novel receptors is the lack of selective reagents,
and the taars are no exception. consequently the development of labeling methods selective for taar, such as high
affinity, radiolabeled antagonists, novel photoaffinity ligands,
and traditional antibodies, will contribute considerably to our
experimental efforts to understand the life cycle of each taar
subtype in vivo and in vitro.
two questions that could be addressed with the reagents
currently available are: do the potential agonists pea, tyr and
the thyronamines (scanlan et al., 2004) differ from the synthetic
agonists amph and meth in their ability to taar
desensitization and trafficking? the answers to these questions
are likely to have important implications for understanding
behavioral sensitization and other effects of chronic psychostimulant exposure.
other questions related to taar trafficking include the
nature of their intracellular localization. are they associated
with vesicles or some other organelle? what are the molecular
determinants of their distribution? what advantage does
intracellular localization of taar confer? do taar form
dimers or higher order complexes with themselves and/or
other gpcr? if so, how is trafficking affected? answers to
these questions should shed light on the biological functions of
these receptors. interestingly, similar questions are also being
asked by those studying gpcr-mediated pheromone signaling
in yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. in that model organism,
where endosomes are emerging as an important platform on
which second messenger signaling events take place (slessareva & dohlman, 2006), exogenously administered pea can
produce an increase in cytosolic h2o2 and ca+2 (pinontoan et
al., 2002).

4.2. trafficking of vertebrate trace amine-associated receptors
the trafficking of vertebrate taar is an aspect of their
biology that warrants further systematic study and most
certainly will hold many surprises. the fact that immunoreactivity associated with heterologously expressed epitope-tagged
taar1 protein appears to be mostly intracellular already is an
indication that something is special about this sequence that
distinguishes it from other catecholamine receptors such as the
da  xxxg655xxx  that typically traffics to the plasma membrane
(bunzow et al., 2001). other gpcr, including those activated
by vasopressin and cannabinoids, have also been reported to
display characteristic cytoplasmic distributions (bohn, 2007;
fenton et al., 2007), while some, such as the  xxxg1642xxx 
(kinsey et al., 2007) and receptors for bioactive lipoids (gobeil
et al., 2006), are associated with the nucleus.
taar trafficking has been difficult to study in vitro
primarily because they are difficult proteins to express.

4.3. pharmacology of the
vertebrate trace amine-associated receptors
the pharmacology of the ta has been a topic of
considerable interest since tyr and pea were first shown by
barger and walpole (1909) and barger and dale (1910) to be
potent pressor agents. the assays that have been developed
over time to explore the physiology and pharmacology of these
biogenic amines have necessarily employed complex tissue
preparations or whole animal models. the complexity of these
systems makes the study of a single receptor subtype
challenging at best and often impossible in practice, even if
so-called receptor “selective” antagonists are available. consequently, the discovery of taar1 and the ability to express it in
vitro independently of other taar has rendered the pharmacologic analysis of this complex family of related sequences
tractable.

372

d.k. grandy / pharmacology & therapeutics 116 (2007) 355–390

4.3.1. structure-activity profiling
of vertebrate trace amine-associated receptors
the first extensive study published on the pharmacology of
any taar was that completed by bunzow et al. (2001). using a
line of hek293 cells they engineered to stably express rat
taar1 they were able to screen a large number of compounds
for their effect on camp accumulation compared to pea, tyr,
and  xxxd1742xxx .
rank order potencies in this functional assay revealed that a
hydroxyl group in the meta-position of pea analogues or the 5position on tryp diminishes a compound's potency at rat
taar1 in contrast to catecholamine receptors. a possible
explanation for this difference is revealed by amino acid
sequence analysis. although putative tm v of the rat taar1
contains the serine residue deep in the putative ligand binding
pocket that is thought to h-bond with the para-hydroxyl of
catecholamines, rat taar1 tm v lacks the shallower,
conserved serine residues that are thought to h-bond with the
meta-hydroxyl of the catechol moiety (liapakis et al., 2000).
another interesting finding to emerge from bunzow et al.'s
extensive quantitative structure activity profiling was that the
meta-o-methyl metabolites 3-methoxytyramine, normetanephrine, and metanephrine are significantly more potent than their
precursors da, ne, and epi. this result is intriguing since it is
widely accepted that these metabolites of catechol-o-methyl
transferase (comt) activity are biologically inactive (langer &
rubio, 1973; seeman, 1980). data from bunzow et al. (2001)
demonstrate that increasing the lipophilicity of catecholamines
by o-methylation of the meta-hydroxyl increases potency and
most likely their affinity as well, although the latter remains to be
conclusively demonstrated. in further support of the conjecture
that endogenous agonists of rat taar1 might be o-methylated
derivatives of the catecholamines is the finding that rat taar1
mrna appears to be most heavily expressed in liver, kidney,
gastrointestinal tract, and brain which are areas where comt is
expression is reported to be highest (männistö & kaakkola,
1999).
the structural similarities between the endogenous ta pea
and tyr and a number of widely abused psychostimulants
including mescaline, amph, meth, and  xxxd2611xxx  (mdma) led bunzow et al. (2001) to test the
ability of these drugs to activate rat taar1. over the limited
range of doses tested all of them were found to be potent
agonists.
in a recently published report reese et al. (2007) extend this
observation by first establishing that pea is a potent and full
agonist at each species of taar examined while tyr is a
potent full agonist for both rodent receptors but less potent and
only a partial agonist at the human–rat chimera. reese et al.
(2007) then went on to show that mouse, rat, and the human–rat
chimera display species-dependent selectivity for the stereoisomers of meth, amph, and para-hydroxy-amphetamine
(poha) when compared to pea. both stereoisomers of meth
were full mouse and chimera taar1 agonists while r(−)
meth was a partial agonist at the rat receptor. s(+)-meth was
the most potent taar1 agonist tested with ec50 values of 0.89,
0.92, and 4.44 mum for rat, mouse, and the chimeric receptor,

respectively. as 2006 came to an end, wainscott et al. (2006)
reported the wild-type human taar1 they stably expressed in
av12-664 cells displays stereoselectivity for isomers of amph
with ec50 values of 994 nm and 1.7 mum for the s(+) and r(−)
forms, respectively.
traditionally the biological effects of the amph are thought
to principally involve the monoamine transporters although
other sites of action have been proposed (shi et al., 2000). in
fact amph and meth have been shown to be “substrate-type
releasers” (rothman & baumann, 2006). they promote da
release from synaptic storage vesicles into the cytoplasm
(partilla et al., 2006) and then into the extracellular space via
dat with an ec50 of 25 nm and a kiuptake in rat synaptosomes
of 34 nm (rothman et al., 2001).
these are drug concentrations approximately 20- to 30-fold
lower than the ec50 values. reese et al. (2007) calculated for
eliciting an in vitro functional response from rtaar1 (0.8 mum).
however, experienced meth users can typically consume
gram quantities of drug per day (kramer et al., 1967) and
achieve peak blood concentrations of 100 mum (derlet et al.,
1989; baselt, 2002; peters et al., 2003). meth's high
bioavailability, low protein binding, and long half-life contribute to its achieving high micromolar plasma concentrations
(drummer & odell, 2001; baselt, 2002; peters et al., 2003).
the extracellular free concentration of meth surrounding
relevant human dopaminergic synapses in the brain presumably
is the relevant pharmacodynamic parameter, at least in part,
underlying the desirable effects of the drug. although this value
is not known with certainty for humans meth serum levels
typically represent 1/10th of what is found in rat brain (riviere
et al., 2000). consequently, when considered together with the
human forensic evidence the in vitro results of reese et al.
(2007) are consistent with the interpretation that in vivo the
human taar1 is likely to be a mediator of at least some of
meth's effects.
that taar1 might mediate some of the actions of amph in
vivo is supported by studies involving mice descended from a
founder in which 1 of its 2 taar1 alleles was deleted. by
selective breeding the descendents of this founder, homozygous
for the targeted taar1 allele, can be generated that are
completely deficient in taar1 from conception (see below;
wolinsky et al., in press).
since tryp acts as a potent (ec50 = ∼ 300 nm) and fully
efficacious agonist at the rat taar1 several ergot alkaloids
were tested for their ability to stimulate camp production in the
receptor-expressing hek cells (bunzow et al., 2001). this
study revealed that dihydroergotamine,  xxxd2021xxx , da, the
hallucinogen d- xxxd2527xxx  (lsd), and the
antiparkinsonian drugs bromocriptine and  xxxd2498xxx  are also
potent stimulators of rat taar1.
an additional interesting feature of rat taar1's pharmacological profile is that several biogenic amine receptor antagonists
and transporters are rat taar1 agonists. included among these
are the adrenergic receptor antagonists  xxxd2914xxx  and
 xxxd3393xxx , the serotonergic antagonists  xxxd1785xxx , dihydroergotamine, and metergoline, and the nonsubstrates of dat
 xxxd2746xxx  and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine

d.k. grandy / pharmacology & therapeutics 116 (2007) 355–390

(mptp). chlorpromazine, a da  xxxg656xxx  antagonist and the
original antipsychotic medication (thuillier, 1999), also has an
agonist's effect on the rat taar1. unfortunately, none of the
biogenic amine receptor antagonists behaved as rat taar1
antagonists. even though a large number of naturally occurring
compounds activate rat taar1, many do not, including
acetylcholine, gaba, glutamate, his, cocaine, and morphine.
after bunzow et al. (2001) the next most extensive
pharmacologic characterization of the rat and human taar1
was conducted by scientists working in the lilly research
laboratories (eli lilly and company, indianapolis, id).
wainscott et al. (2006) successfully cotransfected the cell line
av12-664 with a rat g alpha's expression construct and either
the wild-type human taar1 epitope-tagged with hemagglutinin or the rat taar1. receptor stimulation by various ligands
was assessed by the accumulation of camp after precautions
were taken to block the endogenous  xxxg831xxx - and beta-adrenergic
receptors endogenously expressed in the av12-664 cells. in
their assay pea has an ec50 of ∼ 100 nm, while congeners with
substitutions on the ring at positions 3 and/or 4 tended to have
diminished potencies. interestingly, compounds with ring
substitutions of small atomic dimensions, such as chlorine, at
the 2 position, displayed ec50s equal to or exceeding that of
pea.
similar to the experience of bunzow et al. (2001), wainscott
et al. (2006) failed to identify a candidate taar1 antagonist but
did find distinct species differences between the rat and human
taar1 that were in agreement with navarro et al. (2006) and
reese et al. (2007). perhaps most striking is that all 3 groups
find that pea is a more potent agonist than tyr at the human
and mouse taar1 whereas tyr is more potent than pea at
the rat taar1.
4.3.2. novel endogenous ligands
of vertebrate trace amine-associated receptors
although rat, mouse, and human taar1 are activated by the
endogenously produced ta as well as da and its o-methoxy
metabolite, it remains to be shown that any of these compounds
act as a taar1 ligand in vivo. the structure–activity profiling
carried out by bunzow et al. (2001) already revealed that the
pharmacology of this receptor was going to be complex with the
demonstration that o-methoxy derivatives of the catecholamines were potent agonists at taar1.
far from futile, the search for additional endogenous taar1
ligands has already led to the discovery of 3-iodothyronamine
(t1am) and its deiodinated relative thyronamine (t0am),
molecules that are closely related to if not derived from thyroid
hormone (scanlan et al., 2004; hart et al., 2006; tan et al.,
2007). based on the structure activity profile compiled by
bunzow et al. (2001) and the fact that the catecholamines and ptyr are all derivatives of the amino acid y, grandy and
scanlan conjectured that decarboxylated metabolites of thyroid
hormone would be taar1 agonists. through the combined
efforts of scanlan's group of synthetic organic chemists and
grandy's group of molecular and behavioral pharmacologists
they were able to demonstrate that t1am and its enantiomer,
t0am, are potent full agonists at rat, mouse (scanlan et al.,

373

2004), and human grandy et al., unpublished observations.
taar1 expressed in vitro with ec50s in the low to middle
nanomolar range. this observation immediately prompted
additional in vitro and in vivo studies that continue to generate
exciting results (see below).
4.4. physiology of the
vertebrate trace amine-associated receptors
4.4.1. cellular signaling
the majority of studies directly investigating taar1
physiology have been conducted in vitro. this is out of
necessity since crucial reagents, such as taar1-selective
agonists and antagonists, remain to be developed. as has
already been pointed out, immortalized cells have many
advantages, but they also suffer from disadvantages. not the
least of these is that the cell most likely does not provide a
cytoplasmic milieu best suited to the heterologous receptor. this
is the reason any conclusion drawn about the physiology of a
receptor studied under such artificial conditions should be
considered suspect until corroborating evidence can be obtained
by in vivo experimentation.
there is no better example of the need for this degree of
caution than the universal acceptance that taar1 activation
results in the stimulation of camp production. it is satisfying
that the predictions made by bunzow et al. (2001) concerning
possible new ligands and signaling pathways based on the
receptor's putative structure were correct. however, it remains
to be firmly established whether or not the stimulation of camp
production is relevant to taar1 biology. investigations into
other second messenger pathways involving kinases, calcium,
and perhaps even volatile signals including  xxxd2738xxx  (no),
should be encouraged and pursued.
an interesting approach to understanding the cellular
biology of taar1 as it relates to da signaling has been
taken by miller, madras, and their colleagues (miller et al.,
2005; madras et al., 2006). based on the ventral midbrain
localization of rodent taar1 transcripts reported by borowsky
et al. (2001) and bunzow et al. (2001) plus the ability of da,
amph, and meth to functionally stimulate the receptor
(bunzow et al., 2001; reese et al., 2007), it was of obvious
interest to explore possible interactions between taar1 and
the dat.
given their impressive past successes studying the effects of
psychostimulants on nonhuman primates these investigators
chose to clone the taar from the rhesus monkey (see above).
subsequent to its cloning the identity of the putative rhesus
taar1 receptor was confirmed by sequence analysis as well as
its in vitro pharmacological and functional profiles. they then
went on to investigate the effect coexpression of human dat
has on rhesus taar1 function. they found that in the presence
of dat the ability of rhesus taar1 to stimulate camp
production in response to pea, amph, and mdma was
increased. in contrast, tyr might interfere with rhesus taar1
to stimulate camp (miller et al., 2005). consistent with the
findings of others they noted that substantial taar1 protein
remains in the cytoplasm of the cells transiently expressing both

374

d.k. grandy / pharmacology & therapeutics 116 (2007) 355–390

constructs and that one explanation for their observations is that
the dat provided an additional route for agonists to access the
receptor (xie & miller, 2007; xie et al., 2007).
4.4.2. thermoregulation and metabolism
the foray into establishing a biological role for taar1, let
alone other members of the family, has been understandably
tentative. many of the experimental reagents required to conduct
meaningful experiments, such as high affinity antagonists,
selective agonists, and receptor antibodies, have yet to be
developed. furthermore, it has only been in the recent past that a
line of mouse, lacking taar1 expression, has been described
(wolinsky et al., in press). in spite of these limitations,
exploration of taar1's role in animal physiology promises to
be extremely exciting if initial reports are confirmed (scanlan et
al., 2004; liberles & buck, 2006; wolinsky et al., in press;
zucchi et al., 2006; chiellini et al., 2007).
as previously mentioned (see above), the existence of a
novel thyroid hormone-like compound that would also be a
taar1 agonist was first hypothesized in 2002 by grandy and
scanlan. that same year chemically synthesized t1am and
t0am were both found to be potent, full agonists at mouse and
rat taar1 heterologously expressed in vitro. intrigued by the
possibility that these 2 molecules could have biological effects
in vivo, and thereby shed some light on possible roles of
taar1. in the fall of 2002 scanlan's group synthesized enough
t1am and t0am to allow grandy's group to investigate the
actions of these thyronamines in mice.
within minutes of receiving an i.p. injection of synthetic
t1am or t0am, mice (scanlan et al., 2004) and the
djungarian hamster phodopus sungorus (braulke and heldmaier, unpublished observations) rapidly enter what appears to be a
torpor-like state characterized by a significant drop in metabolic
rate and behavioral inactivity. simultaneously the animals
display profound bradycardia hypotension, and hypothermia
that are dose-dependent and fully reversible.
encouraged by these findings, a mass spectrometry method
using artificial standards that unequivocally detects picomol
quantities of both t1am and t0am in biological material was
developed. subsequently with the synthesis of a deuteriumsubstituted t1am standard by scanlan's group the method is
now both sensitive and quantitative. coupled with a simple
organic extraction procedure, the means were available for
grandy, scanlan, and their colleagues to look for the presence of
both compounds which they have found in the brains of mice,
rats, and guinea pigs. in subsequent studies, both compounds
were also found in human plasma and serum (j. douglass,
unpublished observations).
although many details remain to be confirmed, a conservative interpretation of these results is that the thyronamines
t1am and t0am are naturally occurring relatives of th that
might be generated by the concerted actions of  xxxd306xxx 
decarboxylase and the 3 th deiodinases that have been
described (visser et al., 1994; kuiper et al., 2000; kalsbeek
et al., 2005; köhrle, 2005; moreno et al., 2005). however, the
possibility that alternative routes of thyronamine biosynthesis
exist must also be explored. furthermore, the rapid time frame

in which their effects manifest and the fact that invariably
responses to thyronamines are in a direction opposite that of th
led grandy and scanlan to hypothesize that the thyronamines
represent a second arm of thyroid hormone biology that
provides rapid feed back to the organism so that it can more
efficiently fine-tune its physiology and metabolism in response
to ever-changing environmental conditions. whether or not
t1am and/or t0am elicit their effects by activating taar1,
or some other taar, in the brain and/or the periphery remains
to be established. however, the very existence of these naturally
occurring, novel thyroid hormone-like compounds means an
exciting new dimension to animal physiology has been revealed
as a direct consequence of efforts to pharmacologically profile
taar1 in vitro.
4.4.3. heart and circulation
the rapid pressor effect produced by tyr and pea in
mammals has been known for a century. in fact it was through
the monitoring of this response in the pithed cat that dale was
able to physiologically characterize and rank the compounds
present in the watery extracts of ergot and putrefied meat that
barger purified and chemically identified (barger & dale, 1907,
1909; barger & walpole, 1909; dale & dixon, 1909; barger &
dale, 1910). these pioneering studies were followed up nearly
80 years later in dogs by shannon et al. (1982) who examined
the cardiovascular and behavioral effects of pea administered
intravenously and found it to produce a short-lived dosedependent biphasic effect on heart rate besides slightly elevating
body temperature. around the same time, human and animal
studies designed to characterize tyr's robust pressor action in
the context of hypertension and mao inhibitor therapy were
conducted by bianchetti et al. (1982) and later by simpson and
de leon (1989).
although the pressor effects of the ta are usually explained
solely in terms of their “false transmitter” properties (kopin et
al., 1964; kopin, 1968), the discovery that taar1 mrna is
expressed in the heart (bunzow et al., 2001) and synthetic
t1am and t0am have such dramatic effects on the
cardiovascular system gave rise to an international effort, led
by dr. r. zucchi at the university of pisa, to explore the
cardiovascular biology of thyronamines and taars.
subsequent to the initial report of scanlan et al. (2004),
zucchi's group (chiellini et al., 2007) explored the actions of
t1am on the isolated working rat heart and in rat cardiomyocytes. in their recently published report, t1am is seen to
produce both a reversible, dose-dependent, negative chronotropic effect, as well as a reversible and dose-dependent,
negative inotropic effect (27 ± 5%, 51 ± 3%, and 65 ± 2%
decrease in cardiac output at 19 mum, 25 mum, and 38 mum,
respectively).
the hemodynamic effects of t1am were notably increased in
the presence of the y kinase inhibitor genistein but decreased in
the presence of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate. no
effect was produced by a panel of  xxxg1836xxx  (pka),
protein kinase c (pkc), calcium-calmodulin kinase ii, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, or mitogen-activated protein (map)
kinase inhibitors. the results of western blotting experiments

d.k. grandy / pharmacology & therapeutics 116 (2007) 355–390

with rat ventricular protein and antiphosphotyrosine antibodies
suggests that phosphorylation of microsomal and cytosolic
proteins is reduced following perfusion with synthetic t1am.
to begin addressing whether the effects of t1am on the
heart are mediated by taar, or some other member of the
family, chiellini et al. (2007) conducted a survey using rt-pcr
that revealed the presence of transcripts for at least 5 rat taar
subtypes (taar1, taar2, taar3, taar4, and taar8a) in
rat ventricle mrna.
in an attempt to demonstrate t1am binding in the heart,
cardiac membranes were labeled with [125i]t1am in the
absence or presence of increasing concentrations of cold
t1am. a specific and saturable binding site is reported with
a calculated kd in the low micromolar range (5 mum). finally,
they completed the picture using tandem mass spectrometry to
show that t1am is endogenous to the heart.
it is noteworthy that the effects of the classic ta pea and
tyr produce a stimulatory effect on the cardiovascular system,
whereas in contrast the thyronamines have the opposite effect. if
the ta and the thyronamines are evoking their cardiovascular
responses by activating taar1, then an interesting paradox
presents itself. however, given the multiplicity of taar genes,
their complex expression in the myocardium, and the lack of
information about their pharmacology and second messenger
signaling, a resolution to this enigma will most likely have to
wait until more is known about each member of this receptor
family.
4.4.4. behavior involving trace amine-associated receptors
mention has already been made (see above) of the rich
literature that implicates ta in a number of human mental
conditions including schizophrenia, adhd, and depression.
the lack of highly selective taar1 ligands without any
confounding catecholamine-releasing actions has made it
impossible to examine the physiology of taar1 in the cns.
however, one way to circumvent the paucity of pharmacological tools and still study the in vivo physiology of taar1 is to
generate a line of mice that do not express the receptor.
wolinsky et al. (in press) report having accomplished this
objective by targeted mutagenesis in an embryonic stem cell
line that eventually gave rise to a founder animal that passed on
the mutant taar1 allele to its progeny. descendents of this
mouse, homozygous for the missing taar1 allele, and their
wild-type littermates have now been evaluated in several
behavioral paradigms amph is known to influence.
the total lack of any taar1 expression had no apparent
effect on the behavior of mice evaluated for overall activity or
anxiety, basal body temperature, or stress-induced hyperthermia
assay. wild-type mice and mice completely lacking taar1
performed at the same level in the y-maze, working memory
task. this is perhaps not surprising given that at least 15
taar1-related genes have been documented in the mouse
(gloriam et al., 2005a, 2005b; lindemann et al., 2005).
intriguingly, mice that completely lack taar1 throughout
their development have a significant deficit in sensorimotor
gating that manifests as a deficit in prepulse inhibition. the
taar1-deficient animals also differ from their wild-type

375

littermates in that they display supersensitivity to the locomotor
stimulating effect of amph. in addition, microdialysis probes
placed in the dorsal striatum revealed that 60 min after the
mutant mice were injected i.p. with amph (2.9 mg/kg), they
respond by releasing significantly more da (910%) in their
dorsal striata than do their wild-type litter mates (410%).
similarly, ne levels were significantly elevated in the taar1deficient mice (837%) compared to wild-type mice (424%).
familiar with the work of seeman et al. (2005) that
documents increased proportions of da d2 receptors in the
high-affinity state (i.e., da d2high) in essentially all animal
models displaying behavioral supersensitivity to da, amph
and other psychostimulants, wolinsky et al. (in press) sought to
determine whether a similar condition existed in the brains of
their supersensitive taar1-deficient mice. they found that in
membranes prepared from the striata of adult mice lacking
taar1 the proportion of da d2 receptors in the d2high state is
significantly elevated 2.6-fold (in wild-type mice, 18.5%;
taar1−/− , 48% representing a 262% increase). thus, it
appears that the phenomenon seeman has described in other
contexts continues to correlate with da-mediated behavioral
supersensitivity. what remains to be established is the
connection between this behavior and taar1-mediated
signaling in the brain and perhaps in the periphery, as well.
4.4.5. olfaction
it was noted by both borowsky et al. (2001) and bunzow
et al. (2001) that taar1 transcripts are expressed at a relatively
low copy number compared to most biogenic amine gpcr.
despite this, borowsky et al. (2001) were successful in their use
of in situ hybridization to map the brain distribution of taar1
transcripts in the mouse.
bunzow et al. (2001) used their rat taar1 clone to probe
northern blots of rna prepared from rat brain and peripheral
tissues as well as sections of rat brain but these efforts failed to
convincing reveal any taar1 message. these results prompted
them to use a more sensitive technique and so turned to rtpcr. always the primary concern with this approach when
applied to the amplification of taar1 transcripts is that the
signal might be the product of amplifying genomic dna
contaminating the cdna template since the gene's coding
region is uninterrupted by introns (lindemann et al., 2005; see
below).
controlling for possible artifacts, bunzow et al. (2001)
collected convincing rt-pcr evidence for the wide-spread
expression of taar1 transcripts in the cns and peripheral
organs of mice, rats, and humans. in a striking example of
simultaneous discovery and corroboration of independent
observations bunzow et al. (2001) and borowsky et al.
(2001) found the densest expression of taar1 transcripts in
the olfactory bulb.
with these 2 initial reports it seemed the way was clear for
those with an interest in gpcr receptors expressed in the
olfactory circuitry to become involved. surprisingly, however,
the scent laid down by borowsky et al. (2001) and bunzow et al.
(2001) was not immediately picked up by the olfactory field.
instead, the olfactory taar were “rediscovered” by liberles

376

d.k. grandy / pharmacology & therapeutics 116 (2007) 355–390

and buck (2006) in the course of their efforts to identify novel
chemosensory gpcr in the olfactory epithelium.
using cdna made from olfactory sensory neuron (osn)
mrna as the template in real-time quantitative rt-pcr primed
with oligonucleotides designed to amplify putative gpcr “…
not previously implicated in odour, pheromone or taste
detection…,” liberles and buck (2006) initially identified
taar7 and taar8 as abundant gpcr transcripts in mouse
osn. subsequent attempts to look for the presence of other
members of the mouse taar family in osn revealed the
expression of transcripts corresponding to each of the mouse
taar genes — except taar1 — at levels comparable to bona
fide odorant receptors. surprisingly, they “…obtained no
evidence for taar1 gene expression in any tissue — including
the brain—apart from the olfactory epithelium…” what
accounts for this discrepancy between the findings of borowsky
et al. (2001), bunzow et al. (2001), and miller et al. (2005)
remains to be determined.
although mouse taars are not close relatives of the
odorant receptors, their expression pattern raised the question:
what chemosensory stimuli activate taar expressed in the
osn? populations of hek293 cells, each transiently expressing a different mouse taar subtype, were screened with
respect to their sensitivity to mixtures of odorants chosen to
cover a broad range of chemical structures and odor qualities at
concentrations of 2–5 mum. in addition to compounds such as
pea that had previously been shown to be taar1 agonists
(borowsky et al., 2001; bunzow et al., 2001; miller et al.,
2005), this screening strategy identified several novel taar
agonists.
transiently expressed mouse taar3 is activated by primary
amines, such as isoamylamine (ec50 = 10 mum) whereas tertiary
amines are 30 times more potent at stimulating mouse taar5
and taar7 transiently expressed in hek293 cells with ec50s
of 0.3 and 20 mum, respectively. similar in sequence to mouse
taar1, mouse taar4 is also activated by pea but is 10-fold
less potent with an ec50 of 1 mum at the latter versus 0.1 mum at the
former.
many taar ligands are derived from amino acids, but
neither f (amino acid precursor to pea) nor leucine (precursor
to isoamylamine) proved to be taar agonists. furthermore, 5
known mouse pheromones, each at a concentration of 0.2 mum,
as well as a major histocompatibility (mhc) peptide at a
concentration of 0.5 mum failed to stimulate any of the mouse
taar. as the authors correctly point out, one plausible
alternative explanation for this negative result is that pheromone-responsive taar do not express well, if at all, in
hek293 cells.
of the taar agonists identified by these investigators, 3 are
known to be present in mouse urine: pea, isoamylamine, and
trimethylamine. interestingly the pea content of urine has been
shown to be elevated in animals under stress while only male
mice excrete both trimethylamine and isoamylamine. interestingly, the latter molecule is ostensibly a pheromone that
accelerates the onset of puberty in female mice.
a search for additional taar agonists in mouse urine was
also attempted. using a complex functional assay, liberles and

buck (2006) were able to show that a potent mtaar5 agonist
of unknown composition is present in urine secreted by postpubertal male balb/c and c57bl/6 mice. this observation
was interpreted as supporting the conclusion that the activating
ligand(s) is/are not mhc-linked cues related to self- or strainrecognition.
finally, whatever compound in male mouse urine is
responsible for stimulating taar5, it appears to be volatile
as evidenced by the stimulation of surrounding cultures of
hek293 cells transiently expressing mtaar5. the authors go
so far as to suggest trimethylamine may be the candidate
activator because of its volatile nature.
4.5. genomics and genetics
of trace amine-associated receptors
the successful sequencing and annotation of several
complete model organism genomes has generated a wealth of
information and opportunities that previously could only be
dreamed of. for those interested in the evolution and phylogeny
of vertebrate gene families, these databases are a treasure trove
with the potential to reveal all of an organism's protein coding
sequences. theoretically then, it is now possible to organize all
of an organism's protein coding genes into families of related
sequences and map them onto their respective chromosomes
with a high degree of precision.
4.5.1. chromosomal localization
of trace amine-associated receptors
prior to the human genome initiative, the physical mapping
of a gene to its chromosome was a difficult and tedious process
that at best resulted in a rough localization with poor resolution
in terms of open reading frame orientation and neighboring
genes. in spite of these limitations it was a worthwhile endeavor
to map every new protein coding sequence because it would
then be in a context that could be related to the findings of
classic genetic linkage and association approaches used to
identify causal factors of human disease.
consequently, whenever a new protein-coding sequence was
identified, there was an immediate interest in mapping it to its
human chromosomal location. the cloning of taar1 was no
exception. borowsky et al. (2001) reported the use of radiation
hybrids in conjunction with primers unique to 4 related human
taar sequences. based on this approach they were able to
assign all 4 of the genes to essentially the same region on the
long arm of human chromosome 6 referred to as q23.2.
independently, bunzow et al. (2001) took a different
approach that involved fluorescence in situ hybridization of a
recombinant lambda phage containing the human taar1 gene
to human metaphase chromosomes. robust hybridization
signals were detected over the long arms of both chromosome
6 chromatids in a region consistent with a localization of
6q23.2.
the mapping of taar1 to 6q23.2 is interesting for several
reasons. first, at least 2 other potential orphan gpcr closely
related in sequence to taar1 had already been mapped to this
region, thus presaging the later finding that all taar genes

d.k. grandy / pharmacology & therapeutics 116 (2007) 355–390

are clustered here. second, this part of chromosome 6 has been
repeatedly associated with schizophrenia in linkage/association
studies, suggesting the possibility of taar1's involvement in
the etiology of psychosis (bunzow et al., 2001).
4.5.2. phylogeny of trace amine-associated receptors
the gpcr represent the largest family of related proteins
coded by the human genome. consequently, there has been a
long-standing interest in trying to organize all of their genes into
families according to conserved sequence motifs. in addition,
the rarity of some gpcr transcripts and the restricted
developmental expression of others mean that a genomic
approach is the only way to insure a complete collection of
gpcr coding genes has been assembled.
in addition to the cloning and characterization of rat and
human taar1, borowsky et al. (2001) also reported a large
number of related human and rat genomic sequences that they had
amplified by pcr using degenerate oligonucleotide primers.
besides the rat and human taar1 they identified 13 more related
genes in the rat plus 3 novel human sequences.
the evolutionary relationship between these putative
receptors was visualized by constructing a branching phylogenetic tree on whose limbs the genes are arranged to reflect the
extent to which they share sequence identity. based on this
analysis borowsky et al. (2001) proposed that the taar form a
branch distinct from other mammalian biogenic gpcr, as well
as the invertebrate tar. based on their analysis they also
proposed that this large family of genes was composed of 2
subfamilies. one of these consists of taar1, taar2, taar3,
taar4, taar5 and the  xxxg1117xxx  pseudogene. the second
subfamily consists of taar6, 7a, 7b, 7d, 7e, 7f, 7g, 8a, 8b, 8c,
and 9 (according to the now accepted nomenclature; see below
and lindemann et al., 2005).
the availability of complete genomic sequences for several
model organisms provided 2 groups, working independently
and unknown to each other, another opportunity to study the
evolutionary origins and phylogeny of the taar family of
genes. in the process a number of sequences that code for
previously unknown taar were identified.
gloriam et al. (2005a, 2005b) approached the phylogeny of
taar from the perspective of evolutionary biologists. aware
of the extensive literature suggesting the clinical importance of
ta in human health and disease, they noted that no definite
function had yet been attributed to these long-studied
molecules. furthermore, essentially nothing was known about
the evolution of their receptors. their thesis then was that a
comparative approach to the evolution and phylogenic
organization of taar would provide important new insights
regarding the biological functions of these receptors.
using published taar1 sequences to query publicly
accessible genomic databases for several vertebrate species,
including humans, mice, rats, and teleost fish, gloriam et al.
(2005a, 2005b) performed a computer-assisted search for
taar1-related genes. the remarkable outcome of this
investigation was the discovery of not only 14 previously
unidentified mouse sequences as well as genes genes coding for
57 putative taar1-like receptors and an additional 40 putative

377

pseudogenes in the genome of the zebra fish d. rerio. mapping
these sequences onto human, mouse, and rat chromosomes
revealed that in all 3 species taar family members are tightly
clustered. in the human each of the 6 taar1-related genes
along with 3 putative pseudogenes are located on chromosome
6 at q23.2. in the mouse all 15 taar1-like genes and one
probable pseudogene are found together on chromosome 10. in
the rat its 17 taar1-like genes and 2 likely pseudogenes are
linked togehter on chromosome 1.
these authors also performed a phylogenetic analysis and,
although much more complicated in appearance than the tree
published by borowsky et al. (2001) given the inclusion of the
large zebra fish contingent, 2 main subfamilies of mammalian
taar1-like sequences were predicted.
in an independent effort, lindemann et al. (2005) initially
used a computer assisted approach similar to that of gloriam et
al. (2005a, 2005b). a comprehensive examination of the
literature and publicly accessible databases uncovered many
different naming strategies were being used to name the
noncatecholic ta-sensitive gpcr and their related sequences.
this created an environment wherein it was cumbersome and
often confusing to relate reports from laboratories that used
different descriptors for their receptors. consequently it was
thought desirable to propose a uniform nomenclature for these
receptor sequences that was not only based on their sequence/
structure but their function as well.
according to their proposal the name of the entire family
would be changed to “trace amine-associated receptors” in
recognition that some taars do not appear to be activated by
ta (although the difficulty with which they are expressed in
tissue culture suggests possible alternative explanations) in
agreement with a prediction based on the putative pharmacophore binding pockets predicted for each of the mammalian
taar (kratochwil et al., 2005). in addition, the number
assigned to each taar gene would reflect its sequential
position along the chromosome and their purported phylogenetic relationships. this proposed nomenclature is now used by
most investigators.
lindemann et al. (2005) went on to complete the inventory
of human, chimpanzee (pan troglydytes), rat, and mouse taar
by identifying 53 taar1-like genes: 9 human, 3 of which are
predicted to be pseudogenes; 9 in chimpanzee, 6 of which are
predicted to be pseudogenes; 19 rat, including 2 putative
pseudogenes; and 16 mouse that includes 1 possible pseudogene. all of the genomic sequences identified were cloned and
sequenced providing confirmation of most but also revealing
discrepancies in some of the published sequences. interestingly,
all of the taar1-like subtypes, with the exception of taar2,
are coded for by genes whose protein-coding regions are
uninterrupted by intervening nonreceptor-coding sequences and
are of approximately the same length.
equipped with what appears to represent the complete
collection of human, rat, and mouse taar sequences,
lindemann et al. (2005) proceeded to assign each gene to its
respective chromosome and determine the orientation of
expression. this exercise revealed that human taar6,
taar8, and taar9 are oriented on their chromosome in

378

d.k. grandy / pharmacology & therapeutics 116 (2007) 355–390

such a way as to be transcribed in the opposite direction of
taar1–taar5. further analysis failed to reveal a functional
human orthologue of the mouse and rat taar7, a subtype that
accounts for almost half the taar genes in these rodent
species. instead the human genome contains a pseudogene
(taar7p). similarly, the rodent taar 3 and taar4 genes
code for functional receptors but these are pseudogenes in the
human.
the chromosomal clustering and extensive sequence identity
between taar genes from multiple mammals suggested that a
phylogenetic approach might yield important clues as to the
biological roles of these receptors. the results of their
phylogenetic analysis of human, rat, and mouse taar suggest
that the ancestral taar sequence has undergone 8 gene
duplication events. these events gave rise to a group of 9 genes
prior to the divergence of the rodent and primate lineages. the
rodent taar7 and taar8 paralogues may have evolved by
recent independent duplications within the mouse and rat
lineages. based on the chromosomal localization of each
species' family of taar, the identification of a carboxyterminal peptide “fingerprint” sequence that is only found
associated with taar, the structure of the phylogenetic tree of
human, rat, and mouse taar, and predicted ligand binding
pockets (see below), lindemann et al. (2005) concluded that the
collection of taar sequences constitutes a new receptor
family, distinct from any other.
every member of the taar family of gpcr shares
structural features that are characteristic of the rhodopsin/betaadrenergic receptor superfamily. collectively their deduced
amino acid sequences predict a protein that contains 7 putative
tm with relatively short amino- and carboxy-termini, 23–49
and 27–33 amino acids in length, respectively. based on the xray crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin and mutational studies
of other gpcr activated by biogenic amines, a highly
conserved 3-dimensional structure emerges in which the
putative 7 tm fold in such a way that their constituent
amino acid residues are positioned to form a ligand binding
pocket. an analysis of all biogenic amine-responsive gpcr,
including the taar, was conducted by kratochwil et al.
(2005), who identified 35 essential tm amino acids that they
predict constitute a “ligand pocket vector” (lpv) that is
theoretically directly responsible for coordinating ligand
binding. interestingly, this analysis predicts 3 pharmacologically, and possibly functionally, distinct subgroups of taar:
group i contains human taar1–taar4; group ii contains
taar5; and group iii contains taar6–taar9.
based on their lpv analysis, these authors predicted that the
pharmacology of the human taar1 would be more similar to
that of mouse taar1 than its rat orthologue, which is the case
for many of the compounds tested. the lpv of taar4,
taar5, and taar9 are nearly identical in all species
evaluated. they also predict that taar1 and taar4 may
well be the only taar that are activated by ta.
the alignment of taar sequences also allowed lindemann
et al. (2005) to identify a unique taar-identifying peptide
motif (nsxxnpxx[yh]xxx[yf]xwf) that overlaps the
sequence that constitutes putative tm vii.

4.5.3. psychiatric genetics
of human trace amine-associated receptors
there is a rich literature that implicates ta in normal and
abnormal human brain functioning. however, the reports of
borowsky et al. (2001) and bunzow et al. (2001) at first seemed
not to have stimulated much interest among psychiatric
geneticists. this is obviously no longer the situation based on
the number of publications that have recently appeared in the
literature.
the first to begin the systematic study of taar genes in
the context of human disease was vanti et al. (2003) who
identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) resulting
in a null mutation in what is now referred to as the human
taar9 gene (formerly ta3; borowsky et al., 2001) but no
association of the snp with adhd or bipolar disorder. this
report was followed by duan et al. (2004), who reported the
identification of polymorphisms in the human taar4 gene
that appeared to be associated with susceptibility to schizophrenia. however, ikeda et al. (2005) reported that they could
find no association between taar4-linked snp and
schizophrenia in a population of japanese patients. a similar
negative result was also reported by amann et al. (2006), and
duan et al. (2006) failed to find an association between
taar4 polymorphisms and schizophrenia in a population of
chinese han.
in 2005, abou et al. published a family-based, case-control
association study of bipolar affective disorder and taar
polymorphisms (abou jamra et al., 2005). pae et al. (in press)
found an association of polymorphisms in human taar6 with
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in a korean case control
sample, but venken et al. (2006) could find no such evidence of
an association of with bipolar disorder in a northern swedish
population.
to date, bly (2005) is the only one to examine human
taar2 gene polymorphisms in the context of schizophrenia.
while searching the 6q23 region, previously identified as a
region of interest associated with schizophrenia (levinson
et al., 2000; schwab et al., 2000), the taar2 was amplied by
pcr from 56 (43 males and 13 females) unrelated normal
(i.e., with no diagnosable psychiatric illness) individuals and
23 individuals (18 males and 5 females) diagnosed with
schizophrenia.
a snp that results in a mutation (g368a) that codes for a
premature stop codon (w123stop) after putative tm iii has
also been found, thus rendering any protein made from the
resulting transcript inactive. this mutation was documented in
10.7% of the schizophrenics and only 5.5% of the control
group. since the number of individuals examined in this study
was small, no significant association of the snp with
schizophrenia was observed; screening a larger sample
population will have to be undertaken.
however, one interesting observation is that of the 3
possible genotypes, not one of the individuals examined
was homozygous for the premature stop codon. this raises
the possibility that in humans, the complete lack of a
functional taar2 receptor is a developmentally lethal
condition.

5. current challenges and future directions
in the short time since the taar were first cloned
(borowsky et al., 2001; bunzow et al., 2001), many advances
in our understanding of ta biology have been made. although
new questions have arisen and some old questions remain the
future of the field is bright.
5.1. pharmacology
the genome of every animal species examined so far
contains a family of receptor-coding sequences that are related
to taar1. the vast majority of these remain to be
pharmacologically characterized in large part due to difficulties
that have been experienced in the course of heterologously
expressing them in vitro. the ability to reliably and stably
express every member of the mammalian taar is of primary
importance if a complete understanding of their biology is to be
achieved, including the identification of their cognate endogenous ligands.
5.1.1. development of trace
amine-associated receptor binding assays
the major impediment currently facing molecular pharmacologists interested in characterizing the taar is in vitro
expression. although transient expression of all mouse taar
has been reported (liberles & buck, 2006), it remains to be seen
if this success can be transferred to other species of taar,
especially the human orthologues.
once routine, stable expression of taar is attainable in an
immortalized cell line these cells can be grown and used as a
replenishable source of receptor for binding studies. although
levels of receptor expression do change over time, cells stably
expressing a gpcr offer a more predictable starting material
than is obtainable from transiently expressing cells.
attempts to establish a reliable radioligand filtration binding
assay for taar1 has been attempted by several academic and
commercial laboratories but no one has so far reported success
(grandy, unpublished observations and personal communications). there are likely to be several reasons for this. at present
the most relevant commercially available radioligand is [3h]
tyr. this is unfortunate since tyr is an agonist and a better
one at the rat than the mouse or human taar1 (reese et al.,
2007). consequently, given that taar are gpcr, it is to be
expected that tyr will have both high and low affinity states.
also a likely negative factor is the apparent low level of receptor
expressed on the surface of transfected cells (borowsky et al.,
2001; bunzow et al., 2001; miller et al., 2005; reese et al.,
2007).
low signal to noise has plagued every attempt to
demonstrate specific binding. the development of a high
affinity, selective taar antagonist will help ameliorate this
problem as well as provide a more suitable radioligand for
characterizing the pharmacodynamics of ta and the taar.
as no taar antagonist is commercially available, recent
efforts in grandy's laboratory have turned to developing a
centrifugation binding assay using [3h]tyr as radioligand. at

379

the present time, using membranes prepared from hek293 cells
stably expressing the rtaar1, this binding assay displays
excellent signal to noise characteristics. although somewhat
cumbersome in execution if it can provide reliable results
heretofore unattainable kinetic data should be forthcoming.
5.1.2. identification of novel
endogenous trace amine-associated receptor ligands
the availability of a reliable binding assay together with a
functional assay of receptor activation (e.g., camp accumulation) provide the means by which to screen for additional
endogenous substances that have activity at the various taar.
caution should be consulted, however, before concluding
that the ta are endogenous taar agonists. simply because an
endogenously synthesized compound acts as an agonist is not
sufficient proof it is an endogenous ligand for a given receptor
subtype. indeed, it has already been shown that other
endogenous compounds, such as the novel thyronamine
t1am and its congener t0am, can have robust biological
activity in rodents with potencies that are predicted by their
activity in functional assays involving recombinant, heterologously expressed taar1. however, the question yet to be
answered remains: does taar1 mediate any of the biological
effects evoked by any of the ta, t1am, or t0am? as barger,
walpole, and dale recognized a century ago the combined
efforts of biologists and chemists offer the most promise for
understanding complex biological systems of medical
importance.
5.2. physiology
future efforts to comprehend the nature and extent of the
physiology evoked by the ta and taar will necessarily
benefit from studies conducted both in vitro and in vivo. among
the advantages of working in vitro is the extent to which the
experimental parameters can be controlled. the major drawback
though, especially when heterologous expression of a gpcr is
concerned, is the unnatural cellular environment the receptor
finds itself in. one must always consider the possibility that
even if a response in the assay is reproducible, it could be a
reproducible artifact that does not convey anything about the
receptor's typical in vivo behavior in terms of trafficking,
signaling, formation of heterodimers, and, therefore, to some
extent its pharmacological profile, as well.
the advantage of in vivo work is that one is assured the
context in which the receptor is typically expressed remains
intact unless efforts to the contrary have been undertaken (i.e.,
lesions or ko mice). the disadvantage is the complexity
inherent to the tissues of interest, especially the brain, that
makes arriving at a firm interpretation risky. in the case of the
taar, efforts to study the biological consequences of their
activation continue to be hindered since no selective taar
antagonists have as yet been reported. while waiting for the
availability of taar-selective antagonists, other approaches
should be considered, including those that eliminate (e.g., kos
mice) or knockdown the expression of the receptor of interest
through antisense or sirna technologies.

5.2.1. trafficking and second messenger signaling
it has been mentioned already that caution is always
advisable when interpreting the results of in vitro assays
involving the heterologous expression of any gpcr. however,
confidence in a particular finding can be bolstered if it can be
demonstrated in another cell line that naturally expresses the
receptor of interest.
a pcr screen of tissue culture collections is likely to provide
the fastest means of identifying cell lines that endogenously
express taar. once identified, these lines representing
multiple organ types could provide the experimental means of
identifying genetic and cellular elements that determine taar
expression, post-translational modification, trafficking, cellular
localization, and second messenger signaling (cornea-hebert
et al., 1999, 2002). they could also be useful in testing the
hypothesis that functional taar exist as homo- and/or
heteromeric complexes.
5.2.2. organ function
the distribution of taar transcripts has been best studied in
rodents. interestingly, with one exception, the experience of
those who have attempted to map taar1 expression have
found it to varying degrees in essentially every tissue examined.
a definitive description of the anatomic distribution of mrna
and protein corresponding to each taar will be a valuable and
necessary resource for designing rational experimental
approaches to understanding taar physiology. currently this
effort is most advanced with respect to taar expression in the
mouse brain (e.g., see www.brainatlas.org/aba).
although a complete expression atlas is not yet commercially available, the anatomic and physiologic evidence
collected so far indicates that taar-mediated signaling is
likely to influence all organ systems, but perhaps most
importantly among them are the brain, heart, skeletal muscle,
pancreas, kidney, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. a better
understanding of taar-mediated signaling in response to
natural and synthetic agonists and antagonists in the tissues of
these organs is likely to provide important new opportunities for
better pharmacological management of human disease. already
the profound effects of the novel taar1 agonist t1am on
rodent physiology appear to affect several organ systems in a
coordinated manner. the nature of these responses is such that if
they occur in humans, important new medical treatments may
be the result.
5.3. genetics
completion of several genome-sequencing projects has
provided the unprecedented opportunity for investigators to
potentially identify all genes that comprise a given family of
sequences in a given species. the success of this approach has
been particularly impressive with respect to identifying
members of the taar gene family. now it appears probable
that all of the human taar1-like genes have been identified
(gloriam et al., 2005a, 2005b; lindemann et al., 2005).
equipped with this knowledge, a number of laboratories have
already successfully begun to identify interesting polymorph-

isms, many of which should be useful in human genetic studies
attempting to uncover association with or linkage to a particular
disease. although the attention of human geneticists has been
focused on the involvement of taar in diseases of the brain it
is likely that in the future our understanding of human maladies
afflicting other organ systems, including the heart, kidney, liver,
pancreas, gastrointrestinal tract, and skeletal muscle will benefit
from a similar analysis.
5.4. animal models and behavior
one of the most exciting aspects of identifying and cloning
all members of the taar family of genes is the unprecedented
opportunity to explore each receptor's contribution to an
animal's biology. the surprisingly large contingent of related
sequences, especially in the genomes of teleost fish and rodents
(gloriam et al., 2005a, 2005b; lindemann et al., 2005),
necessitates the development of many new reagents, such as
receptor-selective antagonists, and animal models.
the recent demonstration that mice lacking the taar1 gene
are viable and display distinct behavioral phenotypes underscores the power of this approach (wolinsky et al., in press).
unfortunately, the large number of taar genes that have been
found in the mouse genome means that many more lines of mice
still have to be generated, a long and expensive proposition.
however, in the end such an effort will prove to have been
worthwhile since together with novel taar-selective pharmacologic agents genetically engineered mice provide the most
certain way to sort out the role of each taar gene product in
normal development, physiology, and behavior involving
olfaction, motivation, movement, various brain pathologies,
and metabolic homeostasis.
6. conclusions
the cloning of the taar1 gene and the subsequent
identification of all related sequences in several mammalian
species, including homo sapiens, represents a major step
toward comprehending the biology of these receptors and the
ta, as well. the ability to routinely and stably express each
taar subtype in vitro will provide an unprecedented
opportunity to define its pharmacology and explore its cellular
(second messenger signaling, desensitization, and internalization) and whole animal physiology. already such efforts have
led to the provocative realization that rodent and human taar1
are activated by meth and related amph, making them
exciting and perhaps important novel targets for the development of medications to treat and combat meth abuse. from
these efforts new molecules, especially subtype-selective
antagonists, will be identified and become valuable reagents
in efforts to understand the functional consequences of taar
activation and inactivation in increasingly more complex
biological systems.
although the ta are endogenously synthesized agonists of
heterologously expressed taar1, their status as the endogenous ligands for any receptor remains to be established. it is to
be expected that in the search for each taar subtype's putative

d.k. grandy / pharmacology & therapeutics 116 (2007) 355–390

endogenous ligand new signaling pathways will be revealed.
the discovery of t1am and t0am being the first examples of
such an outcome, is already forcing a reexamination of thyroid
hormone signaling as it relates to metabolism, behavioral
activation, and mood. that certain taar gene products are
expressed in cells constituting the mouse olfactory epithelium
and are activated by volatile non-ta present in mouse urine
raises the intriguing possibility that a role for taar in
discriminating social cues can be anticipated in other species,
including humans.
already human psychiatric geneticists have made important
discoveries with respect to the possible contribution of taar to
mental illness and other pathologies of the brain such as
parkinson's disease. as more studies are undertaken and data is
collected the extent to which any one of these genes contributes
to predisposing an individual to disease will be established and
hopefully provide insights on and new options for treating
medical conditions for which no therapy currently exists.
receptors for ta have long been sought in efforts to
establish the innate biological significance of these fascinating
noncatecholic biogenic amines. now that candidate genes for
their putative receptor proteins have been found, the task at
hand is to discern the pharmacology and physiology of each
purported member of this extended family of gpcr. only then
will it be possible to know whether taar1 is the family
archetype or its iconoclast.
