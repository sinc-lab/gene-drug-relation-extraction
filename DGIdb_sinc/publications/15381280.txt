gaba is synthesized from two  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase (gad) isoforms,  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx .  xxxg850xxx  is important for the local control of gaba synthesis at the
synaptic sites, whereas  xxxg849xxx  is responsible for maintaining gaba baseline levels for both neurotransmitter and
metabolite (esclapez et al., 1994; esclapez and houser,
1999; martin et al., 2000; qu et al., 1998).
recently we observed the increased gad 65 and 67
expressions in gabaergic neurons of the hippocampal
ca1 region of the gerbil after transient forebrain ischemia
(kang et al., 2002b). this report suggested that temporal
alterations of gad immunoreactivities reflect the sequential changes of the gabaergic neuronal discharge after
ischemic damage (choi et al., 1999). however, the alterations of gad isoforms immunoreactivities induced by
ischemic insult showed different temporal patterns. briefly,
at 30 min post-ischemia, the immunoreactivities of the both
gad isoforms were markedly elevated. at 3 h after ischemic insult,  xxxg850xxx  immunoreactivity was recovered at the
sham level in the ca1 region. however, increased  xxxg849xxx 
immunoreactivity was detected at 24 h after ischemic insult. these temporal alterations of gad immunoreactivities reflect the sequential changes of the gabaergic neuronal discharge after ischemia, because  xxxg849xxx  plays a
major role during tonic neuronal activity, whereas  xxxg850xxx 
is particularly recruited and phosphorylated during increased phasic activity (choi et al., 1999; kang et al.,
2002a; kouyoumdjian and ebadi, 1981). however, these
changes in gad expression did not supply direct evidence
concerning the increase of gaba release or synthesis,
because gad isoforms differ substantially in their interactions with cofactor pyridoxal 5=-phosphate (plp), which is
catalyzed by  xxxg1720xxx  (plk; choi et al., 1999;
costa et al., 1998; erlander et al., 1991; erlander and
tobin, 1991; fukuda et al., 1998; houser and esclapez,
1994; laming et al., 1989; weiner and molinoff, 1994).
on the basis of plp concentration ratios,  xxxg850xxx 
makes up the majority of the inactive apogad reservoir in
gabaergic neurons, in contrast  xxxg849xxx  is nearly saturated
with plp as a holoenzyme (costa et al., 1998; erlander
and tobin, 1991; esclapez and houser, 1999; robin and
kalloniatis, 1992). therefore, it is plausible that alterations
of both gad isoforms induced by ischemia would be regulated in response to alterations in plk expression, although altered plk expression and its activity have not

abstract—in the previous study, we observed chronological
alterations of  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase (gad), which is
the enzyme converting glutamate into gaba. gad isoforms
( xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx ) differ substantially in their interactions
with cofactor pyridoxal 5=-phosphate, which is catalyzed by
 xxxg1720xxx  (plk). in the present study, we examined the
chronological changes of plk expression and activity in the
hippocampus after 5 min transient forebrain ischemia in gerbils. plk immunoreactivity in the sham-operated group was
detected weakly in the hippocampus. ischemia-related
change of plk immunoreactivity in the hippocampus was
significant in the hippocampal cornu ammonis (ca1) region,
not in the hippocampal ca2/3 region and dentate gyrus. plk
immunoreactivity was observed in non-pyramidal gabaergic
neurons at 30 min to 3 h after ischemic insult. at 12 h after
ischemic insult, plk immunoreactivity was shown in many
ca1 pyramidal cells as well as some non-pyramidal cells. at
this time point, plk immunoreactivity and protein content
was highest after ischemia. thereafter, plk immunoreactivity and protein content is decreased time-dependently by 4
days after ischemic insult. four days after ischemia, some
astrocytes expressed plk in the ca1 region. the specific
plk activity was not altered following ischemic insult up to 2
days after ischemic insult. thereafter, the specific plk activity decreased time-dependently. however, total activity of
plk was significantly increased 12–24 h after ischemic insult, and thereafter total activity of plk decreased. therefore,
we suggest that the over-expression of plk in the ca1 pyramidal cells at 12 h after ischemia may induce increase of gad
in the ca1 pyramidal cells, which plays an important role in
delayed neuronal death via the increase of gaba or enhancement of gaba shunt pathway. © 2004 ibro. published by

changes of plk in the hippocampus in order to determine
the relationship between the neuronal damage and gad
expressions following transient ischemia in gerbils.

experimental procedures
experimental animals
this study utilized the progeny of mongolian gerbils (meriones
unguiculatus) obtained from the experimental animal center, hallym university, chunchon, south korea. the animals were
housed at constant temperature (23 °c) and relative humidity
(60%) with a fixed 12-h light/dark cycle and free access to food
and water. procedures involving animals and their care were

conformed to the institutional guidelines, which are in compliance
with current international laws and policies (nih guide for the
care and use of laboratory animals, nih publication no. 85–23,
1985, revised 1996). all experiment was conducted to minimize
the number of animals used and suffering.

induction of ischemia
male mongolian gerbils (m. unguiculatus) weighing 66 –75 g were
placed under general anesthesia with a mixture of 2.5% isoflurane
in 33% oxygen and 67% nitrous oxide. a midline ventral incision
was made in the neck. both common carotid arteries were isolated, freed of nerve fibers, and occluded using non-traumatic
aneurysm clips. complete interruption of blood flow was confirmed by observing the central artery in eyeballs using an ophthalmoscope. after 5 min of occlusion, the aneurysm clips were
removed from both of the common carotid arteries. restoration of

blood flow (reperfusion) was observed directly under the ophthalmoscope. sham-operated animals (n⫽10) were subjected to the
same surgical procedures except that common carotid arteries
were not occluded. body temperature was monitored and maintained at 37⫾0.5 °c during the surgery and during the immediate
postoperative period until the animals recovered fully from anesthesia. at the designated reperfusion times, the sham-operated
and operated groups were killed for this study (kang et al., 2003;
won et al., 2001).

tissue processing and immunohistochemistry
all animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium, and
perfused transcardially with 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline
(pbs; ph 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m pb (ph
7.4) at 30 min (n⫽10), 3 h (n⫽10), 12 h (n⫽10), 1 day (n⫽10), 2
days (n⫽10), and 4 days (n⫽10) after the surgery. brains were
removed, and postfixed in the same fixative for 6 h. the brain
tissues were cryoprotected by infiltration with 30% sucrose overnight. thereafter the brain tissues were frozen and sectioned with
a cryostat at 30 ␮m and consecutive sections were collected in
six-well plates containing pbs.
the sections were sequentially treated with 0.3% hydrogen
peroxide (h2o2) in pbs for 30 min and 10% normal horse serum
in 0.05 m pbs for 30 min. the sections were next incubated with
diluted mouse anti-plk antibody (diluted 1:200; choi et al., 1999;
kang et al., 2002a) overnight at room temperature. thereafter the
tissues were exposed to biotinylated horse anti-mouse igg and
streptavidin peroxidase complex (vector, burlingame, ca, usa).
the sections were visualized with 3,3=-diaminobenzidine in 0.1 m
 xxxd3449xxx  and mounted on the gelatin-coated slides.
to confirm the neuronal loss in the hippocampal ca1 region 12 h after ischemic insult, the sections were incubated with
diluted mouse anti-neun (diluted 1:1000; chemicon, temecula, ca, usa). this experiment was conducted parallel to
abovementioned immunohistochemistry.

double immunofluorescence study
to confirm the neuronal type containing plk immunoreactivity,
double immunofluorescent staining for both the mouse anti-plk
antiserum (1:25) and the rabbit anti-gad 67 ( xxxg849xxx , 1:50;

chemicon) was performed. we also performed the double immunostaining for both the mouse anti-plk antiserum (1:25) and the
rabbit anti- xxxg883xxx  (gfap; 1:100; chemicon,
usa) to confirm the glial type. other brain tissues were incubated
in the mixture of antisera overnight at room temperature. after
washing three times for 10 min with pbs, the sections were also
incubated in a mixture of both fitc-conjugated goat anti-mouse
igg (1:200; jackson immunoresearch, usa) and cy3 conjugated
goat anti-rabbit igg (1:600; jackson immunoresearch) for 2 h at
room temperature. the immunoreactions were observed under
the axioscope microscope attached hbo100 (carl zeiss,
germany).

western blot study
five animals in each group, which were mentioned above, were
used in this immunoblot study. after kill and removal of the hippocampal ca1 region, the tissues were homogenized in 50 mm
tris containing 50 mm hepes (ph 7.4), egta (ph 8.0), 0.2%
np-40, 10 mm edta (ph 8.0), 15 mm sodium pyrophosphate,
100 mm ␤-glycerophosphate, 50 mm naf, 150 mm nacl, 2 mm
sodium orthvanadate, 1 mm pmsf and 1 mm dtt. after centrifugation, the protein concentration was determined in the supernatants by using the micro bca protein assay kit with bovine
 xxxg124xxx  as the standard (pierce chemical, usa). aliquots
containing 20 ␮g total protein were boiled in loading buffer containing 150 mm tris (ph 6.8), 3 mm dtt, 6% sds, 0.3% bromophenol blue and 30% glycerol. then, each aliquot was loaded
onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel. after electrophoresis, the gels
were transferred to nitrocellulose transfer membranes (schleicher
and schuell, usa). to reduced background staining, the filters
were incubated with 5% non-fat dry milk in pbs containing 0.1%
tween 20 for 45 min, followed by incubation with mouse anti-plk
antiserum (1:500), with peroxidase-conjugated horse anti-mouse
igg (sigma, usa), and then with ecl kit (amersham, usa).

enzymatic assay
five animals in each group (the same animals in western blot
study) were used in this enzymatic assay. plk from gerbil hippocampus was purified according to a procedure of kerry et al.

matography and g-100 gel filtration. enzymatic activity was measured by following change in absorbance at 388 nm, at which plp
has an absorption coefficient of 4900 cm⫺1 m⫺1 at ph 7.0. initial
rate measurements were carried out by monitoring the change in
absorbance at 388 nm for at least 3 min in a double beam spectrophotometer. the standard assay mixture was to measure plk
activity contained 0.07 m potassium phosphate (ph 6.5), pyridoxal
(0.1 mm), atp (0.1 mm) and  xxxd3556xxx  (0.05 mm).

quantification of data and statistical analysis
sections (10 sections per animal) were viewed through a microscope connected via ccd camera to a pc monitor. at a
magnification of 25–50⫻, the regions were outlined on the
monitor and measured their areas. each studied field in each
tissue was selected within the midpoint of hippocampal ca1-3
regions and the dentate gyrus containing all layers. images of
plk immunoreactivity in each region of each animal were
captured with an applescanner. the brightness and contrast of
each image file were calibrated by adobe photoshop version
2.4.1, and analyzed using nih image 1.59 software. values of
background staining were obtained and subtracted from the
immunoreactive intensities. the intensity of plk immunoreactivity was evaluated by means of a relative optical density
(rod) value. rod value was obtained after transformation of
mean gray values into rod using the formula. also the results
of western blot study were scanned and rod value was obtained using scion image software (nih). all data obtained from
the quantitative data were analyzed using one-way anova to
determine statistical significance. bonferroni’s test was used for
post hoc comparisons. p value below 0.05 or 0.01 was considered statistically significant.

results
plk immunohistochemistry
in the sham-operated group, plk immunoreactivity was
weakly detected in pyramidal and non-pyramidal cells in
the hippocampal ca1-3 regions (fig. 1a) and the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (data not shown).
ischemia-related changes of plk immunoreactivity were
significant in the hippocampal ca1 region, not in the
ca2/3 region and the dentate gyrus (fig. 2). in the ca1
region, some non-pyramidal cells show plk immunoreactivity at 30 min after 5 min transient forebrain ischemia
(fig. 1b). at 3 h after ischemia-reperfusion, the immu-

nodensity and number of plk-immunoreactive neurons
was slightly increased (figs. 1c and 2). at this time after
ischemia, well-stained processes were distributed in the
strata radiatum and oriens (fig. 1c).
at 12 h after ischemic insult, plk immunoreactivity
in the ca1 region showed significant differences after
ischemic injury (figs. 1d). in this group, strong plk
immunoreactivity was shown in the pyramidal cells in the
stratum pyramidale. at this time point after ischemic
insult, non-pyramidal cells were decreased in number as
compared with 3 h post-ischemic group (fig. 1d). at this
time point, the number of neun-immunoreactive neurons was not altered in the hippocampal ca1 region
(figs. 1f, 1g). compared with 3 h after ischemic insult,
plk immunoreactivity in the ca1 region was significantly elevated (figs. 1d and 2). thereafter, plk immunoreactivity and plk-immunoreactive cells were decreased in the ca1 region (fig. 2). this immunoreactive
pattern was maintained up to 2 days after ischemic
insult.
three to 4 days after ischemic insult, plk immunoreactivity disappeared in neurons in the ca1 region, and plk
immunoreactivity was low as compared with 2 days postischemic group (figs. 1e and 2). in this time periods, plk
immunoreactivity was intensified in glial components because the delayed neuronal death of ca1 pyramidal cells
occurred in the ca1 region (figs. 1e and 2).
double immunofluorescence study
from 30 min to 3 h after ischemic insult, plk immunoreactivity was detected in non-pyramidal cells in the ca1
region, and its immunoreactivity was increased timedependently (figs. 1b and 1c). based on morphology and
double immunofluorescence study, plk-immunoreactive
neurons were gabaergic (fig. 3).
three to 5 days after ischemic insult, almost pyramidal
cells in the ca1 region were lost because the delayed
neuronal death occurred (data not shown). in this time
period, plk immunoreactivity was intensified in glial cells
(fig. 1e). in this study, based on the morphology and
double immunofluorescent staining, the glial cells were

ischemia (figs. 5). the plk protein content was highest at
12 h after ischemic insult, thereafter the content decreased
by 4 days after ischemia. the results of the quantitative
data obtained from image analysis and western blot study
were consistent with the immunohistochemical study.
three to 4 days after ischemic insult, however, plk immunoreactivity was elevated as compared with 2 days after
ischemic insult, because of increased plk immunoreactivity in astrocytes, presumably.
analysis of enzyme activity
as for the result of the enzyme activity assay, the specific
plk activity (0.0027– 0.0031 unit/mg protein) was not altered following ischemic insult up to 2 days and thereafter
the specific plk activity decreased time-dependently
(figs. 6). however, the total activity of plk was significantly increased 12–24 h after ischemic insult and thereafter, its immunoreactivity decreased (fig. 6).

identified as the astrocytes (figs. 4). some astrocytes
contained plk after occurrence of the delayed neuronal
death in the ca1 region.
western bolt study
in this study, we examined that the result of western bolt
study showed the pattern of plk expression similar to that
of immunohistochemistry after 5 min transient forebrain

in brain tissue,  xxxd3047xxx  is essential for the synthesis of some neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and gaba, which are important in the
maintenance of physiological homeostasis in the cns (fabri
and manzoni, 2004; grabbet et al., 2002; marshall et al.,
2001; nagy and hiripi, 2002; won et al., 2001). because the
formation of  xxxd3047xxx  from atp, pyridoxal and
divalent metal ions are catalyzed by plk, the enzyme seems
to play a pivotal role in  xxxd3047xxx  synthesis (costa
et al., 1998; geng et al., 1997; nurgali et al., 2003; yamashima et al., 2001). in the present study, we focused upon
the chronological alterations of plk expression concerning
with gaba metabolism in the hippocampus after 5 min transient forebrain ischemia.
in the present study, we observed that the plk immunoreactivity, protein content in and total activity of this
enzyme in the hippocampal ca1 region was increased by
12 h after ischemic insult, although the specific activity of
this enzyme was not altered. in addition, accumulated plk
immunoreactivity is predominantly detected in the pyramidal (glutamtergic) neurons, while its immunoreactivity was
significantly decreased in the non-pyramidal (gabaergic)
neurons.
in the previous study, we reported that  xxxg849xxx  immunoreactivity was significantly increased in the hippocampal ca1
region at 12–24 h after ischemic insult (kang et al., 2000,
2002b). in the present study, we also found that the plk
immunoreactivity was significantly increased in this time. the
increase of plk in this time point strongly supports our previous study that the  xxxg849xxx  immunoreactivity was significantly increased at 12 h after ischemic insult (kang et al.,
2002a).
we also found in the previous study that the temporal
changes in  xxxd2431xxx  transporter-1 ( xxxg2143xxx ) expression
were similar to those of  xxxg849xxx , but not  xxxg850xxx  expression, at least prior to 12 h after ischemic insult.  xxxg2143xxx 
immunoreactivity was increased in the ca1 region at 30
min after ischemia and recovered at 3 h post-ischemia

fig. 5. western blot analysis of plk in the gerbil hippocampus derived from sham-operated and operated groups. the rod of immunoblot band is
also represented. the bars indicate the means⫾s.e.

(kang et al., 2002b). at 12 h after ischemic insult,  xxxg2143xxx 
immunoreactivity was re-enhanced in the ca1 region, and
maintained by 24 h after ischemia-reperfusion. these results and our present study indicate that the temporal
alterations of  xxxg2143xxx  expression could be closely related to
the turnover of gaba release or synthesis prior to 12 h
after ischemia. this is because the temporal alterations of
 xxxg2143xxx , gad and plk expressions showed the proportionality. at 12 h after ischemia, plk immunoreactivity was
significantly elevated in the ca1 region. this finding postulates that gaba release or synthesis is elevated in the
ca1 region at this time point after ischemia. this is because an overactive inhibitory system has been observed
in the ca1 region at 12 h after ischemia-reperfusion (kang
et al., 2000).
transient cerebral ischemia stimulates gaba synthesis via  xxxg849xxx  and at the same time increases gaba
breakdown by  xxxg8xxx  ( xxxg8xxx ) in the hippocampal ca1 region (kang et al., 2000, 2002b).
 xxxg849xxx  and  xxxg8xxx  immunoreactivities were significantly increased in pyramidal cells, and the increased
 xxxg849xxx  and  xxxg8xxx  immunoreactivities may be associated with the destruction of hyperactive glutamatergic
pyramidal cells in the hippocampal ca1 region. it has

been reported that drugs, which potentiate gaba levels
or have gabaergic properties, provide significant neuronal protection when used before or after ischemic
insult in global or focal ischemic animal stroke models
(manev et al., 1989; shuaib et al., 1992). increased
 xxxg849xxx  and  xxxg8xxx  immunoreactivities in the non-pyramidal cells would also impede the entry of carbon
atoms from gaba into tca cycle via the  xxxd3251xxx .
hence these gabaergic neurons in the hippocampus
are considered to be particularly resistant to ischemia
and n-methyl-d-aspartate excitotoxicity (gagliardi,
2000; schousboe et al., 1973; won et al., 2001). this
result is contradictory to previous study of lateral caudoputamen and lower parietal cortex using middle cerebral artery occlusion model (håberg et al., 2001). they
reported that gabaergic neurons in the lateral caudoputamen and lower parietal cortex were more sensitive
to ischemia than glutamatergic neurons in the same
region. this discrepancy may be the differences in
whether the gaba shunt pathway is excitation or inhibition. in the caudoputamen and lower parietal cortex,
cerebral ischemia stimulates gaba synthesis via gad
and the same time inhibits gaba breakdown by  xxxg8xxx 
(sloviter et al., 1996). these changes consequently in-

fig. 6. the enzyme activity of plk in the hippocampus after ischemic insult. there is no statistical difference in the specific activity between groups
until 2 days after ischemic insult. thereafter, the specific activity of plk is significantly decreased. however, the total activity is increased 12–24 h after
ischemic insult, and thereafter the total activity is decreased. (* p⬍0.05 significant differences from adjacent group.)

crease the gaba content (erecinska et al., 1984). our
previous report describes the decrease of the  xxxg8xxx 
immunoreactivity in the ca1 region at the same time
point (kang et al., 2002b). in fact, the inhibition of
 xxxg8xxx  increases gaba efflux via reverse transport
(kang et al., 2002b). therefore, these findings also suggest that extracellular gaba concentration may elevate
to attenuate the excitability of pyramidal cells in the ca1
region. at 24 h after ischemic insult, enhanced neuronal
types of  xxxg2143xxx ,  xxxg849xxx  and plk-immunoreactive cells
in the ca1 area were pyramidal cells and non-pyramidal
gabaergic neurons. these plk and  xxxg849xxx  expressions in ca1 pyramidal cells may be related to the gaba
metabolism, not neurotransmitter. in the previous study,
we also observed that  xxxg8xxx  and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase expressions were highly elevated
in ca1 pyramidal cells at this time point after ischemic
insult (kang et al., 2000, 2002b).
hence, these results support that in this time period the
increased plk and gad immunoreactivity in pyramidal
neurons may be used in gaba shunt metabolism to form
the  xxxd3251xxx , and this material metabolizes into atp.
in conclusion, therefore, our findings suggest that, at least
24 h after transient ischemic damage, an increase of plk
expression in the hippocampal ca1 region may be associated with cellular energy metabolism from ischemic damage via the gaba shunt enzymes.
