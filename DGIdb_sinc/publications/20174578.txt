variable na(v)1.5 protein expression from the wild-type allele correlates with the penetrance of cardiac conduction disease in the  xxxg2028xxx (+/-) mouse...  loss-of-function mutations in  xxxg2028xxx , the gene encoding na(v)1.5 na+ channel, are associated with inherited cardiac conduction defects and brugada syndrome, which both exhibit variable phenotypic penetrance of conduction defects. we investigated the mechanisms of this heterogeneity in a mouse model with heterozygous targeted disruption of  xxxg2028xxx  ( xxxg2028xxx (+/-) mice) and compared our results to those obtained in patients with loss-of-function mutations in  xxxg2028xxx .
