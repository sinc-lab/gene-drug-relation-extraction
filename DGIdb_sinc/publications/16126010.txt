abstract
pancreatic ganglia contain noradrenergic nerve terminals whose role in ganglionic transmission is unknown. intracellular recordings from
rabbit pancreatic neurons were used to study the effects of a-adrenergic agonists and antagonists on ganglionic transmission and to determine if
endogenously released norepinephrine contributed to synaptic depression. significant regional differences in a adrenergic effects were
observed. in neurons from ganglia of the head/neck region norepinephrine or selective a2 agonists presynaptically inhibited ganglionic
transmission and this effect was antagonized by the a2 antagonist yohimbine. in the majority of cells membrane hyperpolarization accompanied
presynaptic inhibition during superfusion of a2 agonists. repetitive nerve stimulation evoked a presynaptic post-train depression (ptd) of
ganglionic transmission in all neurons tested. a combination of nisoxetine (selective inhibitor of the  xxxg2148xxx ) and tyramine
(releaser of endogenous catecholamines) increased ptd. pretreatment with clonidine inhibited synaptic transmission and abolished ptd while
yohimbine did not affect it. pretreatment with  xxxd2243xxx  ( 3.5 h) also failed reduce ptd while neurons unresponsive to a2 adrenoceptor
agonists routinely exhibited ptd, implying the presence of other inhibitory neurotransmitters sharing a common presynaptic mechanism with
a2 agonists. in the majority of neurons from ganglia of the body region superfusion of norepinephrine or the selective a1 agonist phenylephrine
evoked membrane depolarization and facilitated ganglionic transmission. these effects were antagonized by the a1 antagonist  xxxd3000xxx . the
remaining neurons exhibited either a2-mediated synaptic inhibition or no-response. in conclusion, inhibitory a2 and excitatory a1 adrenoceptors
exist in pancreatic ganglia and predominate in the head/neck and body, respectively. norepinephrine, released during repetitive nerve
stimulation, may contribute to synaptic depression in the head/neck region and appeared to share a common mechanism with other, unidentified
neurotransmitters mediating synaptic depression in both regions. these differences indicate a functional heterogeneity of pancreatic sympathetic
innervation that may reflect the reported regional differences in exocrine and endocrine cells.

1. introduction
the importance of the sympathetic nervous system in
regulating both pancreatic exocrine and endocrine secretion
is well established. stimulation of sympathetic nerves
decreased the volume of exocrine secretion, stimulated
glucagon and  xxxg1823xxx  secretion, and inhibited
insulin and somatostatin secretion. these effects were

mimicked by adrenergic agonists and blocked by adrenergic
antagonists (singer, 1993; brunicardi et al., 1995; ahren,
2000). histochemical studies have confirmed the presence of
noradrenergic nerve fibers, but not nerve cell bodies in the
pancreas (alm et al., 1967; love and szebeni, 1999).
retrograde tracing confirmed that noradrenergic nerves in
the pancreas originated from the celiac ganglion (sharkey and
williams, 1983) and celiac/superior mesenteric ganglionectomy removed nearly all noradrenergic fibers in the pancreas
(anglade et al., 1987).
in the endocrine pancreas, noradrenergic fibers innervate
endocrine cells, blood vessels, and pancreatic ganglia (alm
et al., 1967; love and szebeni, 1999). the pattern of

46

e. yi, j.a. love / autonomic neuroscience: basic and clinical 122 (2005) 45 – 57

sympathetic innervation is consistent with altered endocrine
secretion due to direct effects on islet cells, and indirect
effects via the vasculature and the cholinergic neurons
innervating the islets (brunicardi et al., 1995; ahren, 2000).
conversely, in the exocrine pancreas, noradrenergic fibers
terminated predominantly in pancreatic ganglia, arterioles
and larger veins, and the pancreatic ducts while few
terminals were observed around acinar cells (alm et al.,
1967; love and szebeni, 1999). recent hplc analysis of
catecholamines in tissues from the rabbit exocrine pancreas
confirmed that ganglia received a density of noradrenergic
innervation second only to that of the major pancreatic
blood vessels while acini received little. these noradrenergic nerve terminals were also capable of uptake, storage,
and nerve-stimulated release of [3h] norepinephrine (yi et
al., 2004, 2005).
in whole animal studies, sympathetic nerve stimulation
inhibited exocrine flow rate by decreasing blood flow to the
pancreas via a1-adrenoceptor mediated vasoconstriction
(barlow et al., 1974; singer, 1993). in the isolated pancreas
or pancreatic fragments, where vasoconstriction played a
much less significant role, exogenous norepinephrine or a2
adrenergic agonists also inhibited pancreatic exocrine secretion (singer, 1993; hubel, 1970; love, 2000). these results
suggested that sympathetic inhibition of exocrine secretion
also involved mechanisms independent of blood flow. the
presence of noradrenergic nerve terminals in pancreatic
ganglia but not acini (love and szebeni, 1999) suggested
indirect sympathetic regulation of exocrine secretion through
actions on ganglionic transmission. sympathetic nerve
terminals were implicated in inhibition of ganglionic transmission in other organs with endogenous norepinephrine,
acting on a2 adrenoceptors, hyperpolarizing postganglionic
neurons and/or decreasing acetylcholine release (morita and
north, 1981; surprenant and north, 1988; mawe, 1993;
dobreva et al., 1998). based on these results, it has long been
assumed that the noradrenergic nerve terminals in pancreatic
ganglia served a similar function to inhibit ganglionic
transmission and thereby inhibit endocrine and exocrine
secretion (singer, 1993; brunicardi et al., 1995; ahren,
2000).
rabbit pancreatic ganglia received a dense noradrenergic
innervation that was two-fold higher in those from the head/
neck compared with those from the body of the pancreas (yi
et al., 2004) and, in preliminary studies using intracellular
recordings, norepinephrine either facilitated or inhibited
synaptic transmission while a1 and a2 adrenoceptor
agonists, respectively mimicked these effects. the effects
also exhibited regional differences with inhibition predominant in the head/neck region and facilitation predominant in
ganglia from the body region (yi and love, 2003). this
study was designed to confirm and extend these preliminary
findings of regional heterogeneity of a adrenergic effects
and determine whether endogenously released norepinephrine contributed to the nerve-stimulated facilitation and
depression reported previously (love, 2000; yi and love,

2005). preliminary reports of this work have been presented
in abstract form (love and szebeni, 1996; yi and love,
2001, 2002a,b, 2003).

2. methods
2.1. animals
new zealand white rabbits of either sex (1– 1.5 kg)
were anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of ketamine (40 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg), and euthanized
with an intracardiac injection of pentobarbital sodium (50
mg/kg) or euthasol\ (pentobarbital sodium 390 mg/ml plus
phenytoin sodium 50 mg/ml). the institutional animal care
and use committee at the university of mississippi medical
center approved these procedures.
2.2. tissue preparation
pancreata with attached duodena were removed to a
dissecting dish containing an ice-cold krebs solution containing (mm): na+, 137.4; k+, 5.9; ca2+, 2.5; mg2+, 1.2; cl ,
134; hco3 , 15.5; h2po4 , 1.2; glucose, 11.5, and bubbled
with 95%o2/5% co2. since the rabbit pancreas is diffuse
with no readily identified head, neck, body, and tail regions,
we arbitrarily divided it into three anatomical regions, head/
neck, body, and tail, comparable to the pancreata of other
species. a mid-line was imagined parallel to the abdominal
aorta. the upper region, attached to the stomach and initial
segment of the duodenum, and within 1.5 – 2 cm of their
walls, was designated the head/neck. the lower region,
within 1.5 –2 cm of the abdominal aorta, was designated the
body of the pancreas. these two regions contained most of
the ganglia found in the entire organ. ganglia located in the
transition area between the head/neck and the body regions
were not used. the thin lobe closely attached to the spleen
(tail) was not studied.
2.3. intracellular recordings
pancreatic ganglia with attached mixed nerve bundles
were dissected free of the parenchyma. two to seven
pancreatic ganglia, interconnected by interlobular nerve
bundles, were securely pinned to the floor of a tissue bath
and superfused with warm (37 -c), oxygenated krebs
solution. intracellular recordings from single neurons were
performed as previously described (love, 2000). only
impalements with stable net resting membrane potentials of
40 mv or greater were accepted. stimuli applied to nerve
bundles activate multiple nerve fibers, possibly including the
axon of the impaled neuron. collision studies were routinely
performed as previously described (love, 2000) to determine
if recorded potentials were orthodromic and/or antidromic.
stimulus trains (10 hz/5 s) were used to evoke post-train
depression (ptd) of nicotinic cholinergic fast excitatory

e. yi, j.a. love / autonomic neuroscience: basic and clinical 122 (2005) 45 – 57

postsynaptic potentials (fepsps; yi and love, 2002b,
2005). nerve trunks were stimulated at 0.5 hz for 30 –60
s to establish the baseline response and 0.5 hz stimulation
resumed following train stimulations. when aps were
evoked by nerve stimuli, ap fractions (number of aps/
number of stimuli) during the 0 –30 s pre-train intervals and
three 30 s post-train intervals were calculated. when only
fepsps were evoked by nerve stimuli, mean fepsp
amplitudes during these intervals were calculated. due to
the low incidence of neurons exhibiting only pre-train
fepsps in normal krebs solution, bath solutions containing
0.5 mm ca2+ and 5.5 mm mg2+ were used to study drug
effects on fepsps. data were acquired and analyzed using
axotape software (axon instruments).
2.4. drug applications
drugs were initially prepared as stock solutions (watersoluble drugs in deionized water and water-insoluble drugs
in  xxxd1896xxx  or methanol,)  xxxd1891xxx -1000x the final
concentration and stored frozen ( 20 -c) until used.
immediately before use, a frozen aliquot of stock was
thawed and diluted to the stated concentration with bath
solution. drug solutions were applied either by superfusion
or pressure ejection. superfusion ensured a known drug
concentration, but required a relatively long time for the
drugs to reach a steady state bath concentration. the volume
of the tissue bath was approximately 6 ml and the
superfusion rate was 2 –3 ml min 1. drug solutions were
considered to have reached steady-state bath concentrations
within 5 min.
drug pipets for pressure ejection were prepared from
glass capillaries used for fabricating intracellular recording
electrodes. pipets were filled with drug solutions containing
a small amount of fast green dye to allow visual
confirmation of drug delivery and mounted in a pipet holder
in a micromanipulator. pressure pulses were applied using a
picospritzer i.ii (general valve corporation, ejection
pressure 125 kpa, n2 carrier gas). pressure ejection allowed
rapid application of drugs for easily controlled time periods
but the exact drug concentration at the site of action was
uncertain. therefore, several precautions were taken to
ensure that pressure ejections resulted in maximal drug
effects that were highly reproducible. first, highly concentrated drug solutions (1 mm unless drug solubility or solvent
effects necessitated lower concentrations) were used to
counteract any dilution of the drug that necessarily occurred
during ejection and ensure a maximally effective concentration at the site of action. second, pipet tips were
positioned in close proximity to the recording site until a
test pressure pulse (1 s) ejected a small cloud of drug solution
that covered the surface of the ganglion surrounding the
recording electrode without causing a pressure artifact and
there was no apparent leakage from the pipet between pulses.
third, the ejection parameters needed for maximal drug
effect were determined for each neuron studied. after an

47

impalement was established, the effects of 1 and 10 s
ejections, separated by 3 min were compared for their effects
on fepsps or action potentials. if peak effects differed, the
pipet tip was advanced closer to the recording site and the
test repeated until the magnitudes (not durations) of the
effects of the two pulses were indistinguishable. a 5 min
washout period was then allowed before data was recorded.
with the high drug concentrations used 1 s pulses routinely
evoked maximal responses. fourth, reproducibility of
maximally effective pressure ejections were ensured by
visually monitoring every drug application and comparing
the magnitudes of the effects of repeated applications during
the course of a recording. any observation of bubble
formation in or plugging of the pipet resulted in its
replacement. any reduction in the agonist effects over the
course of a recording, regardless of the cause, excluded the
later responses from analysis. only ach-containing pipets
exhibited the potential to cause significant receptor desensitization if placed and maintained too close to the recording
pipet. moving the pipet to a remote position between
recordings, positioning the pipet at a greater distance from
the recording site, and using briefer pressure pulses evoked
reproducible ach potentials without measurable desensitization. fast green dye alone had no effect.
2.5. statistical analysis
statistical significance between groups was determined
using sigma stat (version 3.0). briefly, when equal variance
and normality assumptions were met, paired or unpaired ttests and parametric variations of analysis of variance
(anova) were used. student – newman – keuls test was
used as a post-hoc test. when either equal variance or
normality assumptions were not met, equivalent versions of
non-parametric tests were used. names of the specific
statistical tests used are indicated. data are expressed as
mean t standard error unless otherwise specified.

3. results
3.1. alpha-adrenergic modulation in the head/neck region
superfusion of norepinephrine (5 –10 am) decreased
fepsp amplitudes or converted synaptic aps to low
amplitude fepsps (fig. 1) in 12/13 neurons from the head/
neck region of the pancreas. in 11/12 cells that exhibited
synaptic inhibition, a membrane hyperpolarization of 6 t 1
mv was also observed. norepinephrine also inhibited
synaptic potentials in 12/15 neurons from the head/neck
region when applied by pressure ejection but membrane
hyperpolarization was observed in only two of these neurons
(3 and 10 mv, respectively).
clonidine, due to its stability and relative selectivity for
a2 adrenoceptors, was used for the remaining experiments
to confirm that activation of a2 adrenoceptors inhibited

ganglionic transmission. clonidine, applied by either
superfusion (10 am) or pressure ejection (1 mm, 1– 10
s), either decreased fepsp amplitudes (from 6 t 0.5 to
3 t 0.5 mv, n = 67; p < 0.01, student’s paired t-test) or
converted synaptic aps to low amplitude fepsps (n = 55)
in 122/129 cells (94%) tested (fig. 2). in 8/8 neurons
where clonidine was applied by both methods, superfusion
(10 am) alone decreased fepsp amplitude from 7 t 0.8 to
3 t 0.6 mv or pressure ejection (1 mm) alone decreased
fepsp amplitude to 3 t 0.5 mv ( p < 0.05, anova
followed by student – newman – keuls test) but pressure
ejection during superfusion of clonidine caused no further
depression of the fepsp (3 t 0.6 mv) indicating that at
these concentrations both methods of application evoked
maximal effects.
in 29/46 cells (63%), superfusion with clonidine caused
significant membrane hyperpolarization of 6 t 1 mv (n = 29;
p < 0.01, student’s paired t-test). in these neurons, inhibition
of synaptic potentials always preceded membrane hyperpolarization (fig. 2b, c). as with norepinephrine, the
method of clonidine application determined the likelihood
of membrane hyperpolarization accompanying synaptic
inhibition. pressure ejection of clonidine depressed synaptic
potentials in 82/83 neurons (99%) but caused membrane
hyperpolarization in only one (6 mv) even when applied for
up to 2 min. the selective a2 adrenoceptor antagonist
yohimbine (1 am) reversibly antagonized clonidine evoked
synaptic inhibition (fig. 3b, c) and reduced membrane
hyperpolarization (from 6 t 1 to 2 t 1 mv, n = 6; p < 0.05,
student’s paired t-test) in 7/7 cells tested. because clonidine
can also bind to imidazoline receptors its effects were
compared to those of uk-14304, a selective a2 agonist that
does not bind to imidazoline receptors (hieble and ruffolo,

1995). in 5/7 cells (71%), uk-14304 (100 am pressureejection or 1 am superfusion) decreased fepsp amplitudes
(from 5 t 1 to 2 t 0.5 mv, n = 4; p < 0.05, student’s paired ttest) or converted synaptic aps to low amplitude fepsps.
the effects of clonidine on synaptic fepsps and the fast
depolarizations evoked by brief applications of ach were
compared (fig. 4) to identify the sites of a2 agonist actions.
superfusion of clonidine (10 am) decreased fepsp amplitudes from 6 t 1 to 1 t 0.3 mv ( p < 0.05, student’s paired ttest, n = 4) but had no effect on fast depolarizations caused
by exogenous ach (12 t 2 vs. 11 t 2 mv, student’s paired ttest, n = 5). these results indicated that clonidine inhibited
fepsps primarily by acting on presynaptic a2 adrenoceptors
to decrease ach release. quantal analysis was performed in
5 cells to further distinguish pre- and postsynaptic actions of
clonidine. synaptic potentials were evoked by low frequency nerve stimulation (100 stimuli at 0.5 of 1 hz) in a
modified krebs solution containing 0.5 mm ca2+ and 5.5
mm mg2+. clonidine superfusion (10 am) decreased mean
fepsp amplitude (from 2 t 0.6 to 1 t 0.4 mv, p < 0.05,
student’s paired t-test) and increased the number of failures
(no detectable response to stimulus) over two-fold. quantal
content and size were calculated using the following

equations: quantal content = ln (number of failures/number
of stimuli) and quantal size = mean fepsp amplitude/
quantal content. quantal content reflects the average
number of quanta (units of neurotransmitter release,
presumably synaptic vesicles) released presynaptically per
stimulus and quantal size, the average amplitude of the
postsynaptic response evoked by one quantum. clonidine
decreased quantal content from 2.09 t 0.43 to 0.63 t 0.31
( p < 0.01, n = 5, student’s paired t-test) but not quantal size
(1.10 t 0.06 vs. 1.10 t 0.05) supporting the conclusion that
clonidine depressed synaptic transmission primarily by
decreasing ach release rather than depressing the postsynaptic response to ach.
3.2. roles of a2 adrenoceptors and endogenous norepinephrine in post-train depression
recent work (yi and love, 2001, 2002b, 2003, 2005)
demonstrated that post-train depression (ptd) of ach
release occurred in a large majority of neurons from both
regions following 10 hz/5 s stimulation. therefore, the roles
of a2 adrenoceptors and endogenous norepinephrine release
in ptd were evaluated. since most neurons exhibited a

fig. 4. pre-and post-synaptic effects of clonidine on fepsps. (a) fast
epsps evoked at 1 hz were reversibly inhibited by clonidine (10 am). the
onset and peak of synaptic inhibition preceded that of membrane hyperpolarization (6 mv). (b) fast depolarizations evoked by 500 ms pressure
ejections of ach (1 mm) were slightly reduced by clonidine. downward
deflections are the membrane responses to 100 ms hyperpolarizing current
pulses (1 hz). the response to ach was tested every 5 – 6 min during the
recording.

mixture of aps and fepsps during 0.5 hz nerve stimulation
and clonidine converted synaptic aps to low amplitude
fepsps, it was difficult to directly compare ptd in normal
krebs solution with and without clonidine. therefore, a
modified krebs solution containing 0.5 mm ca2+ and 5.5
mm mg2+ was used to ensure that only pre-train fepsps
occurred. the typical pattern of synaptic potentials observed
under these conditions, before, during and after 10 hz/ 5 s
stimulation, is illustrated in fig. 5.
pre-train (0.5 hz) stimulation evoked only low amplitude fepsps (5 t 1 mv; n = 7), mean fepsp amplitude
decreased to 3 t 1 mv ( p < 0.05; student’s paired t-test)
during the 0– 30 s post-train interval and recovered within
90 s (fig. 6). pretreatment with clonidine (10 am) reduced
mean pre-train fepsp amplitude from 5 t 1 to 2 t 1 mv and
train stimulation produced no further depression of fepsp
amplitudes during the post-train period (fig. 6). these

results indicated that ptd and a2 agonist-stimulated
inhibitions shared a common presynaptic mechanism and
that maximal activation of that mechanism could not
completely block ach release.
if norepinephrine mediated ptd, then increasing the
concentration of endogenously released norepinephrine
should depress ganglionic transmission and increase the
magnitude of ptd. therefore, the combined effects of
nisoxetine, an inhibitor of the  xxxg2148xxx ,
and tyramine, a releaser of endogenous norepinephrine, on
ganglionic transmission were studied. during the pre-train
interval ap fraction was depressed relative to control
(0.60 t 0.16 vs. 0.79 t 0.14, n = 6) but this failed to reach
statistical significance. following train stimulation, ptd
was observed in both control and nisoxetine plus tyramine
solutions (fig. 7). ap fraction decreased from 0.79 t 0.14 to
0.50 t 0.14 in control solutions and from 0.60 t 0.16 to
0.27 t 0.10 in nisoxetine plus tyramine ( p < 0.05; student’s
paired t-test). at the peak of ptd (0 – 30 s post-train), ap
fraction was decreased (from 0.50 t 0.14 to 0.27 t 0.10;
p < 0.05; student’s paired t-test) relative to control values by
the addition of nisoxetine plus tyramine suggesting that
endogenous norepinephrine release contributed to synaptic
depression. however, despite the lower absolute value of
ap fraction during the 0 – 30 s post-train interval in
nisoxetine plus tyramine, the absolute magnitude of ptd
relative to the pre-train interval was not significantly greater
than that of control (fig. 7). ap fraction decreased by
0.28 t 0.06 in control solution and by 0.33 t 0.08 in
nisoxetine plus tyramine.
if norepinephrine contributed to ptd, blocking a2
adrenoceptors should antagonize ptd. in cells firing pretrain aps, 1 am yohimbine, a concentration previously
demonstrated to antagonize the synaptic inhibition caused
by clonidine, failed to antagonize ptd (fig. 8) and the
overall pattern of ptd in the absence and presence of
yohimbine was not different (n = 8, two-way repeatedmeasures anova).
finally, the effect of inhibiting norepinephrine release
with  xxxd2243xxx  on ptd was tested. a total of 30
pancreatic neurons from the head/neck region, exhibiting
either ap/fepsp mixtures (n = 17) or only fepsps (n = 13)
during pre-train (0.5 hz) stimulation, were pretreated with
10 am  xxxd2243xxx  ( 3.5 h) and stimulated with 10 hz/5
trains. post-train depression was observed in 15/17 cells
(88%) exhibiting ap/fepsp mixtures and in 10/13 cells
(77%) exhibiting only pre-train fepsps. in neurons exhibiting pre-train mixtures of ap/fepsps (fig. 9 top), ap
fraction was significantly decreased from 0.88 t 0.06 to
0.46 t 0.06 ( p < 0.05, friedman test followed by a student –
newman – keuls test) in  xxxd2243xxx -treated cells but the
magnitude of ptd (0.42 t 0.05, n = 15) was not different
from that of control cells (0.53 t 0.03, n = 65; student’s ttest). in neurons exhibiting only pre-train fepsps (fig. 9
bottom), mean fepsp amplitude was significantly decreased
from 11 t1 to 7 t 1 mv ( p < 0.05, friedman tested followed

cells but the magnitude of ptd (4 t 1 mv, n = 10) was not
different from that of untreated cells (3 t 0.4 mv, n = 37,
student’s t-test).
3.3. effects of a1 agonists in the head/neck region
norepinephrine superfusion evoked a membrane depolarization of 6 t 0.3 mv in only 3 of 28 neurons from ganglia
of the head/neck region. the rarity of such responses
precluded further investigation.
3.4. alpha-adrenergic modulation in the body region
when norepinephrine was applied by superfusion (5 –10
am) to neurons from the body, membrane depolarization

(8 t 1 mv; p < 0.01 student’s paired t-test) accompanied by
synaptic facilitation was observed in 4/4 cells. a representative response is illustrated in fig. 10a. in the same
neuron, the selective a1 agonist phenylephrine (5 am)
superfusion reproduced the norepinephrine effects (fig.
10b). in 7/10 neurons tested, phenylephrine superfusion
(5 –10 am) caused a mean depolarization of 7 t 1 mv
( p < 0.01, student’s paired t-test). adding the a1 antagonist
 xxxd3000xxx  (1 am) to the superfusate reduced phenylephrine
depolarizations from 8 t 2 to 3 t 1 mv ( p < 0.01, student’s
paired t-test) in 7/7 neurons tested.
pressure ejection allowed a more rapid testing of a1
agonist effects in a larger population of neurons. in 8/33
cells (24%), norepinephrine (1 mm, 2 – 3 s) evoked a 4 t 1
mv membrane depolarization. phenylephrine (1 mm, 2– 5
s), evoked a depolarization (fig. 11a) of 6 t 1 mv ( p < 0.01,

student’s paired t-test) in 5/16 cells (33%). in 3 of these
neurons clonidine pressure ejection was also tested and
found to have no effect on synaptic transmission (fig. 11b).
thus, as in the head/neck, a1 and a2 adrenoceptors did not
appear to occur on the same neurons or their cholinergic
synapses. when 10 hz/5 s train stimulation was applied to
the same neuron, ptd was observed (fig. 11c) despite the
lack of inhibition by clonidine indicating a non-adrenergic
component of ptd existed in ganglia from the body as well
as those from the head/neck. the incidence and magnitude
of depolarizations evoked by pressure ejection of a1
agonists were markedly lower than those observed with
superfusion. this observation suggested that the site of
action in intact ganglia was not accessed using this form of
drug application and no further studies of a1 agonists were
conducted using this technique.
a total of 40 neurons from the body region were tested
for the effect of a2 agonists on synaptic transmission.

potentials to fepsps in 3/10 and 2/10 cells, respectively. an
example is shown in fig. 12. norepinephrine caused no
change in membrane potential (fig. 12a) but reversibly
decreased fepsp amplitude from 16 to 10 mv (fig. 12b).

4.1. alpha-adrenergic presynaptic inhibition and post-train
depression
presynaptic inhibition of ganglionic transmission by
adrenergic agonists occurred in almost all neurons from
the head/neck but only a small minority of those from the
body of the pancreas. the indistinguishable effects of the
non-selective a agonist norepinephrine, the relatively
selective a2 agonist clonidine, and the highly selective a2
agonist, uk-14304, on synaptic transmission and their

fig. 8. effects of an a2 adrenoceptor antagonist on post-train depression. in
neurons from the head/neck, synaptic action potentials were evoked at 0.5 hz
before and after 10 hz/5 s stimulation in the absence and presence of 1 am
yohimbine. yohimbine had no effect on post-train depression of ap firing
(n = 8). *** different from pre-train interval ( p < 0.001) using a two-way
repeated-measures anova followed by a student – newman – keuls test.

antagonism by yohimbine implicated a2 rather than a1 or
imidazoline receptors.
alpha adrenergic inhibition resembled synaptically
evoked post-train depression (ptd), which also appeared
to be saturable and due to inhibition of ach release (yi and
love, 2002b, 2005), and could ablate it. in other autonomic
neurons, a2 adrenoceptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition
usually involves pertussis toxin (ptx) sensitive g-proteins
whose hg subunits directly inhibit voltage-dependent ca2+
channels or activate k+ channels (delmas et al., 1999;
starke, 2001; surprenant and north, 1988), although ptxinsensitive inhibitory pathways have also been reported
(schwartz, 1997). the sharing of a limited number of
effectors (ca2+ or k+ channels and/or g-proteins) in the
small nerve terminals by a2 and other inhibitory receptors
could explain both the overlap and saturability of both forms
of inhibition. alternatively, the failure of either maximal
nerve or agonist stimulation to completely block the fepsps
may indicate that some cholinergic nerve terminals in the
head/neck region lack inhibitory a2 adrenoceptors.
rabbit pancreatic ganglia from both regions exhibit a
catecholamine-containing nerves, high concentrations of
norepinephrine relative to other tissues of the exocrine
pancreas, and nerve-stimulated release of [3h]norepinephrine consistent with a functional noradrenergic innervation
(yi et al., 2004, 2005). however, the modest effects of
nisoxetine plus tyramine, and the lack of effect of
yohimbine and  xxxd2243xxx  on ptd indicated that noradrenergic sympathetic nerves alone did not mediate ptd.
pancreatic neurons receive innervation from a mixture of
extrinsic and intrinsic fibers from multiple sources containing a mixture of neurotransmitters (singer, 1993; brunicardi

53

et al., 1995; ahren, 2000). under the experimental
conditions (mixed nerve stimulation), if multiple, overlapping inhibitory pathways were activated receptor antagonism of any single transmitter could have a little effect on
ptd. the marked regional differences in the incidence of a2
agonist-stimulated inhibition compared with the uniformly
high incidence of ptd in both regions also supports the
existence of multiple inhibitory transmitters. other possible
inhibitory neurotransmitters include acetylcholine acting on
presynaptic muscarinic receptors in pancreatic ganglia
(love, 2000), and the peptides enkephalin (louie et al.,
1988), galanin (herzig et al., 1993), cgrp (bunnett et al.,
1991), and  xxxg2240xxx  (kirkwood et al., 1999), all of which
appear to inhibit pancreatic exocrine secretion indirectly
through actions on cholinergic non-cholinergic nerves.
thus, noradrenergic sympathetic and non-adrenergic,
non-sympathetic inhibitory pathways appear to exist in
pancreatic ganglia and to share overlapping, presynaptic
mechanisms of action. noradrenergic depression of trans-

mission could serve as a synapse-specific mechanism for
inhibiting exocrine and/or endocrine secretion and might
allow individual synapses to operate over a greater dynamic
range of excitatory input by lessening the probability of
saturation of the postsynaptic response (ap fraction = 1) in
response to increasing presynaptic firing.
4.2. alpha adrenergic hyperpolarization
in the head/neck region membrane hyperpolarization
routinely occurred during superfusion but rarely during
pressure ejection of agonists and never during repetitive
nerve stimulation. several explanations are possible. the
receptors may not be readily accessible to synaptically
released or pressure ejected agonist suggesting that this
effect would have to be triggered by circulating catecholamines. alternatively, hyperpolarization may have been
obscured by the concomitant sepsps observed after
repetitive synaptic stimulation (love, 2000) or repetitive
stimulation of other nerves resulted in presynaptic inhibition of norepinephrine release at the synapses mediating
hyperpolarization.
the site of agonist action resulting in hyperpolarization
remains to be identified. it could result from a direct
postsynaptic effect, as with enteric ganglia (morita and

north, 1981; surprenant and north, 1988; dobreva et al.,
1998), from inhibition the tonic release of an excitatory
(depolarizing) transmitter, or from release of a second
inhibitory transmitter that hyperpolarized the neurons.
resolution of this question will require studies of the effects
of selective noradrenergic nerve stimulation, blockade of
synaptic transmission with tetrodotoxin and low ca2+, high
mg2+ solutions, and agonist effects on acutely isolated
neurons. regardless of the mechanism, the relatively small
magnitude of hyperpolarization, the high percentage of cells
exhibiting ptd in the absence of hyperpolarization, the
abolition of fepsps by clonidine pressure ejection in the
absence of hyperpolarization, and the minimal effects of
agonist-evoked hyperpolarization on ach potentials, all
indicated only a minor role for hyperpolarization in a
adrenergic inhibition of transmission.
4.3. alpha adrenergic depolarization and synaptic
facilitation
alpha-adrenergic facilitation of transmission occurred in
a large majority of neurons from the body but rarely in those
from the head/neck region. depolarization resulting from
activation of postsynaptic a1 adrenoceptors has been
reported in other parasympathetic neurons (ishibashi et al.,

e. yi, j.a. love / autonomic neuroscience: basic and clinical 122 (2005) 45 – 57

presynaptic innervation (davis, 1995). in humans and other
mammals, including rabbits, glucagon-secreting a cells are
densely distributed in islets of the body and tail regions but
relatively rare in islets of the head/neck whereas pancreatic
polypeptide-secreting cells are frequently found in islets the
head/neck but not in the body of the pancreas (bishop and
polak, 1997; malaisse-lagae et al., 1979; orci et al., 1976).
heterogeneity of zymogen granule content (jeraldo et al.,
1996), and non-parallel agonist-stimulated enzyme secretion
of the exocrine pancreas has also been demonstrated
(adelson et al., 1995). thus, regional differences in the
effects of sympathetic nerves on ganglionic transmission
may help coordinate pancreatic secretion to match the
nutritional content of a meal.
these sympathetic nerves may also play a role in
pathology of the pancreas since they appear much more
sensitive to pathological insults than parasympathetic
nerves. neuroaxonal dystrophy due to aging has been
reported in sympathetic ganglia of humans and animals
(schmidt, 2002) and, in diabetic animals, selective loss of
sympathetic nerves supplying the pancreas (mei et al.,
2002) has been reported. unchecked cholinergic tone to the

fig. 11. effects of phenylephrine and clonidine on a neuron from the body.
(a) pressure ejection of phenylephrine (pe; 1 mm, 2 s) evoked a 6 mv
depolarization. downward deflections were membrane responses to
constant amplitude hyperpolarizing current pulses (100 ms, 1 hz). (b) in
the same neuron, clonidine (1 mm, 10 s) had no effect on rmp ( 57 mv)
or synaptic potentials. (c) train stimulation (10 hz/5 s) evoked post-train
depression followed by a sepsp that abbreviated the post-train depression.

2003; shibata and taketani, 2001; akasu et al., 1985). as
with the postsynaptic hyperpolarizations, additional experiments will be required to determine if the a1 adrenoceptor
mediated depolarizations resulted from a direct action on the
neurons or secondary to changes in the release of another
depolarizing transmitter. regardless of the mechanism of the
effect, noradrenergic facilitation of ganglionic transmission
would increase the probability that all cholinergic or noncholinergic excitatory synapses on these neurons would
trigger aps. this may explain earlier reports that sympathetic nerve stimulation increased pancreatic exocrine
secretion and that this effect was blocked by atropine
(babkin et al., 1939; barlow et al., 1974).
4.4. physiological significance
the regional differences in alpha-adrenergic effects on
synaptic transmission in pancreatic ganglia might reflect the
reported regional heterogeneity of pancreatic endocrine and
exocrine cells since the target of a neuron can determine its

fig. 12. noradrenergic inhibition of synaptic transmission in the body. (a)
pressure ejection of norepinephrine (ne; 1 mm, 2 s) had no effect on rmp
( 58 mv). downward deflections were membrane responses to constant
hyperpolarizing current pulses (100 ms, 1 hz). (b) in the same neuron,
norepinephrine (1 mm, 2 s) depressed fepsp amplitude from 16 mv to 8
mv. c. the neuron also exhibited post-train depression following 10 hz/5 s
train stimulation.

pancreas can result in an inflammatory state resembling
acute pancreatitis (gorelick et al., 1999). since activation of
sympathetic nerves innervating pancreatic ganglia primarily
depresses ganglionic transmission, reducing cholinergic
tone to the acini, a loss of sympathetic innervation might
increase the risk of pancreatitis. indeed, a loss of inhibitory
regulation of cholinergic transmission has been implicated
in chronic pancreatitis in animals and humans (tiscornia
and dreiling, 1987; gronroos et al., 1992).

5. conclusions
the electrophysiological data presented here provide the
first functional evidence of alpha-adrenergic modulation of
synaptic transmission in pancreatic ganglia. this corroborates and expands earlier histochemical and biochemical
evidence of functional noradrenergic innervation of rabbit
pancreatic ganglia and regional differences in the density of
this innervation. the data also establish regional differences
in the distribution and function of a adrenoceptors in
ganglionic transmission resulting from a predominance of
inhibitory a2 or excitatory a1 receptors in ganglia from the
head/neck and body of the pancreas, respectively. these
regional differences may parallel the reported regional
differences in the distribution of pancreatic endocrine and
exocrine cells.
