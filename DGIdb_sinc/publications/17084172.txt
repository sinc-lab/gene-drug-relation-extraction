purpose: virtually all patients with high risk localized and metastatic prostate cancer who are treated with  xxxd3327xxx 
deprivation therapy eventually have progressive clinical or biochemical disease despite this therapy. despite this fact
numerous therapies are available that target the interaction of  xxxd3327xxx  and  xxxg183xxx  in the castrate testosterone
milieu and many clinical investigations are under way in this area.
materials and methods: this literature review focuses on the current clinical literature in support of secondary hormonal
therapy.
results: despite low  xxxd3327xxx  levels the  xxxg183xxx  remains active through the amplification, mutation or alteration
of coactivator function. these observations suggest that secondary hormonal therapies remain a reasonable clinical approach.
such approaches can be receptor or ligand directed. receptor directed approaches to secondary hormonal therapy are
antiandrogen withdrawal, sequential use of antiandrogens and estrogenic compounds. ligand directed therapies are adrenal
cortex inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and others in clinical development. furthermore, in the context of  xxxd3327xxx 
independent tumor growth in patients with metastatic disease clinicians are now faced with the choice of using chemotherapy
or secondary hormonal manipulations. appropriate patient selection is a critical component to the effective use of these
agents.
conclusions: the modest activity of these secondary therapies challenges the notion that advancing prostate cancer
uniformly becomes hormone refractory. it offers an alternative to the early use of chemotherapy in patients with  xxxd3327xxx 
independent disease.
key words: prostate, prostatic neoplasms,  xxxd3327xxx  antagonists, ketoconazole, adrenal cortex hormones

lectively challenged the definition of hrpc. in 1995 taplin2
and tilley3 et al reported mutations in the ar ligand binding domain, suggesting that mutations were the underlying
mechanism of this syndrome. subsequent studies performed
by calgb determined that the incidence of ar mutations in
aipc was rare with only 5 of 48 samples (10%) harboring a
mutated receptor.4 furthermore, no relationship was observed between ar mutations and an aawd response, defined as a psa decrease of greater than 50%. overall an
aawd response is observed in less than 20% of patients.
nevertheless, this observation prompted reexamination of
the belief that prostate cancers that progress while on adt
are truly hormone refractory.

he first evidence that an intermediate state exists
between what are commonly called hormone sensitive
prostate cancer and hrpc developed in 1992 when
the antiandrogen withdrawal phenomenon was reported.1
in these reports it was suggested that  xxxd2143xxx , which was
in widespread use as an antiandrogen, had the capability of
actually stimulating tumor growth. thus, simply removing
this agent became a therapeutic maneuver and it is now
considered mandatory to truly document disease progression while on cab. more recently a number of secondary
hormonal manipulations were described that are now an
important part of disease management. although the use of
these approaches is supported by randomized, phase iii
data, the clinical decision making for when to use them and
in whom continues to be defined. in this review we describe
the published literature and offer guidelines for the use of
secondary hormonal manipulations for aipc.

t

terminology relative to the
hormone sensitivity of prostate cancer
there is no current consensus as to the most appropriate
nomenclature for advancing prostate cancer. at issue is the
difficulty of incorporating terminology that recognizes the
importance of tumor growth in the castrate state while acknowledging its sensitivity to secondary hormonal therapies. there is general agreement that patients with testosterone levels greater than 250 ng/ml and tumor that is
responsive to castrating therapies may be labeled as “hormone naïve.” however, disease progression despite castrate
testosterone has been labeled aipc, defined as resistant to
castration but sensitive to secondary hormonal manipulations, or hrpc, defined as resistant to all hormonal manip-

secondary hormonal therapies
ulations.5 the relative inadequacy of this nomenclature is
evident when one considers that metastatic disease in the
castrate state, which is labeled by many as hrpc, is more
sensitive to  xxxd2041xxx  containing chemotherapy combinations than to chemotherapy alone.6 also, certain patients
with rapid progression on initial hormonal therapy may be
treated with chemotherapy in lieu of secondary hormonal
manipulations, thereby blurring the distinction between
aipc and hrpc. suffice it to say that not all aipc is
hormone refractory and prostate cancer may, in fact, never
become completely hormone “refractory.”
mechanisms of  xxxd3327xxx 
independent tumor growth
numerous mechanisms of  xxxd3327xxx  independent growth
have been proposed, including ar gene amplification, ar
gene mutation leading to persistent activation, ar promiscuity for nonandrogen agonists and ar promiscuity leading
to activation by pharmacological antagonists such as  xxxd2143xxx  and  xxxd334xxx . more recent evidence implicates
altered recruitment of coactivators in combination with receptor amplification as a potential underlying mechanism of
resistance to antiandrogen therapy.
how do we assess the efficacy of
secondary hormonal manipulation?
the sensitivity of secondary hormonal therapies can be assessed by the psa response to a drug in an individual.
although it is not widely used as an overall surrogate
marker for the response to all therapies, eg chemotherapy
and bisphosphonates, psa responses are more likely a valid
intermediate end point when evaluating drugs that affect
the ar axis. for example, in the recent calgb 9583 study
of second line hormonal therapy the 4-week landmark analysis showed that patients with a psa response, defined as a
psa decrease of 50% or greater within 12 weeks of therapy
initiation, experienced a median survival of 41 months compared to 13 months in those without a 50% decrease in psa
(p ⬍0.001).7 these prospective data corroborated a prior
retrospective analysis demonstrating that median survival
in patients who achieved a 50% or greater decrease in psa
at 12 weeks on various clinical trials (chemotherapy and
investigational therapies) at memorial sloan-kettering
cancer center was 25.3 months compared with 13 months
in those who did not (log rank p ⫽ 0.0001).8
when are secondary hormonal
therapies preferred over chemotherapy?
chemotherapy is now considered an active therapy for prostate cancer and referral to a medical oncologist is recommended in all patients with disease progression despite initial  xxxd3327xxx  deprivation therapy. however, aipc is a
diverse clinical entity based on the presence or absence of
metastases, the location of metastases (nodal only or bone
plus nodal) or symptoms and chemotherapy should not be
the automatic choice in all patients. increasingly patients
diagnosed with hormone refractory disease after initiating
 xxxd3327xxx  deprivation have serological-only relapse without
metastases. as a result, it is now possible for patients to
have nonmetastatic hrpc. the likelihood that such pa-

s67

tients will have metastatic disease after  xxxd3327xxx  independence develops is high but it can be relatively slow to occur.
in a recent prospective analysis of such patients median
time to bone metastases was 3 years.9 therefore, it is reasonable to consider that patients with serological-only relapse are unlikely to become rapidly symptomatic and they
also may derive clinical benefit from therapies that decrease
the likelihood of psa progression. it is these patients as well
as those who experience disease progression on adt in the
presence of a low volume of metastases who may be the best
population for secondary hormonal manipulations.
the eastern cooperative oncology group 1899 study was
designed to test this question. in this study patients with
castration resistant nonmetastatic disease were randomized
to kc or docetaxel. unfortunately the question remains
unanswered because the study closed due to poor accrual.
early termination of this study is instructive. 1) it tells us
that patients with prostate cancer may be unwilling to be
randomized to a chemotherapy vs a nonchemotherapy treatment. 2) it suggests that clinicians understand the biological
heterogeneity of aipc and they were already making clinical decisions regarding therapy based on their knowledge of
disease biology even in the absence of randomized data. in
either case the choice between chemotherapy and secondary
hormonal therapy is now relegated to clinical judgment because to our knowledge no prospective trial is under way or
planned.
prognostic models have been developed to assess patients
who have progressive castrate metastatic disease despite
initial hormonal therapy and they may be useful for making
this clinical judgment. in these models the factors with the
largest impact on patient survival were those that correlated
with the disease burden, including performance status, hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase.10 another model validated the importance of these
factors but also identified gleason grade of the primary
tumor as prognostic.11 however, these models were derived
from data sets consisting entirely or almost entirely of patients with metastatic disease. these nomograms may be
useful for determining whether it is reasonable to consider
advancing a patient to chemotherapy in lieu of further hormonal manipulations.
hormone therapy after aawd
broadly characterized, the 3 therapeutic classes of secondary hormonal manipulations are 1) secondary antiandrogen
therapy, 2) adrenal  xxxd3327xxx  targeted therapy and 3) estrogens. features common to all of them are favorable tolerability, modest response proportions and relatively short
response durations. consequently it is not unusual for patients to receive a series of sequentially administered second
line therapies.
while to our knowledge no prospective study has been
performed to answer the question, it is generally assumed
that maintenance of a castrate testosterone milieu is important even in the face of  xxxd3327xxx  independent disease. retrospective data in support of continued  xxxd3327xxx  suppression come from a retrospective analysis of 341 patients
treated in a series of clinical trials performed by the eastern
cooperative oncology group, in which discontinuation of
medical castration emerged as an independent predictor of
shorter survival. based on these data and pending further

s68

secondary hormonal therapies

study in this area the current clinical standard is for testicular  xxxd3327xxx  suppression to continue despite disease progression, presumably to suppress any residual hormone responsive clones of cancer cells as well as maintain
uniformity with patients who have undergone orchiectomy.
secondary antiandrogen therapy
a sound biological rationale exists to support the use of a
secondary oral antiandrogen. for example, in the lncap
cell line  xxxd2143xxx  can act as a partial agonist but the ar
may subsequently be inhibited by  xxxd334xxx . clinically
the success of the deferred use of an antiandrogen following
progression on gonadal  xxxd3327xxx  suppression appears to be
inversely proportional to the disease burden. for example,
 xxxd2143xxx  has been shown to produce a 50% or greater decrease in psa in 80% of men with localized disease and 54%
of those with metastatic disease but in only 23% of those
with symptomatic metastatic disease, in whom it resulted in
a benefit no greater that that seen with prednisone.12 these
data represent merged results from several trials, of which
some were prospective and some retrospective, and they
should be interpreted with caution. a study of  xxxd334xxx 
at a dose of 150 mg daily, which is triple the standard dose,
administered following disease progression on cab with
 xxxd2143xxx  demonstrated psa decreases of 50% or greater in
23% of patients.13 in each report the likelihood of a response
to second line antiandrogens was higher if patients had
responded initially to  xxxd2143xxx . a separate retrospective
analysis revealed that 50% of patients treated with  xxxd2725xxx  after progression on other antiandrogens experienced
a 50% or greater psa decrease.14 in this analysis the median response duration was 11 months. a prospective study
with  xxxd2725xxx  reported sustained psa decreases of 50% or
greater in 29% of patients. interestingly all 5 patients
(100%) who had prior antiandrogen withdrawal responses
also responded to  xxxd2725xxx , in contrast to only 3 of 17
(18%) who did not have prior antiandrogen responses.14
taken together these data support the use of sequential
antiandrogens and suggest that patients who respond to 1
antiandrogen are more likely to respond to secondary and
tertiary drugs of this class.
therapies targeting adrenal androgens
in the face of testicular  xxxd3327xxx  suppression the adrenal
androgens dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and androstenedione retain the potential to
stimulate prostate cancer growth since these steroids are
weak agonists for wt and mutant ars (see figure). as a
consequence, strategies to decrease adrenal cortical  xxxd3327xxx  production in patients with aipc have been developed
and are currently in widespread use.
in initial studies the drug  xxxd147xxx  was used
with replacement doses of hc, resulting in psa decreases of
more than 80% in 48% of the patients treated (table 1).15
more recently 200 mg kc 3 times daily or 400 mg 3 times
daily with 20 mg hc each morning and 10 mg each bedtime
(kc/hc) has been used. in a pilot study 20 consecutive
patients with progressive disease despite cab were treated
with 400 mg kc orally 3 times daily and hc simultaneously
with aawd.16 of these patients 11 (55%) experienced a 50%
or greater decrease in psa and the median response duration was 8.5 months.

adrenal  xxxd3327xxx  synthesis cascade. black highlighted boxes represent enzymes inhibited by  xxxd55xxx  acetate. dhea, dehydroepiandrosterone.

after antiandrogen withdrawal high dose kc/hc resulted in a psa decrease of 50% or greater in 30 of 48
evaluable patients (62.5%).17 low dose kc at 200 mg
orally 3 times daily, which was studied prospectively in 28
patients, resulted in a psa decrease of 50% or greater in
46%.18 the median psa response duration was greater
than 30 weeks. none of the 16 patients responded who
were subsequently treated with high dose kc at 400 mg
orally 3 times daily at disease progression while receiving
low dose kc.
after these small studies calgb performed a randomized phase iii trial of aawd alone or in combination with
high dose kc/hc. in this study the proportion of psa responders of patients undergoing aawd alone was 10% compared to 32% in the combination arm (p ⫽ 0.001).7 of patients treated with kc/hc plus aawd 14% experienced
objective responses in 2-dimensionally measured lesions
compared with 7% of those undergoing aawd alone. taken
together these data suggest that kc is an active drug in a
substantial proportion of patients with disease progression
on an antiandrogen and it may be considered an acceptable
secondary hormonal agent in this clinical context. further
studies with kc will seek to determine the mechanism of
resistance to this therapy. in addition, a number of other
drugs are now being added to kc in the phase ii setting,
including the bisphosphonate al, the 5␣-reductase inhibitor
dutasteride and the immune modulating cytokine granulocyte-macrophage  xxxg526xxx .
a novel adrenal  xxxd3327xxx  inhibitor that selectively inhibits 17-␣ hydroxylase/c17,20-lyase, is being studied in patients with aipc (see figure). by more selectively inhibiting
adrenal enzymes and sparing the corticosteroid pathways
hc replacement may not be necessary with this agent.

corticosteroids
corticosteroids themselves may have modest anti-prostate
cancer activity as single agents (table 2). in 1 study 37
patients with hrpc were treated with daily oral prednisone
at doses of 7.5 to 10 mg. after 1 month of therapy improvements in quality of life were noted in 38% of the patients and
this effect was maintained for a median of 4 months in 19%.
kelly et al reported a 50% or greater decrease in psa lasting
a median of 4 months in 20% of patients treated with hc at
a dose of 40 mg daily.19 the 2 largest randomized trials
providing data on corticosteroids described the control arm,
each using 40 mg hc daily. a 22% response was observed in
116 patients in the hc control arm of a randomized trial
comparing this drug alone to its combination with mitoxantrone.20 in a group of 231 patients who received hc as
the control arm of a  xxxd3266xxx  trial a response rate of 16% was
observed.19 dexamethasone may have a slightly higher degree of activity. storlie et al reported psa decreases in 61%
of 38 patients treated with 0.75 mg 3 times daily, although
confirmatory data have not been reported.21 of those experiencing significant psa decreases 35% also had objective
responses. taken together these data indicate that corticosteroids should be considered modestly active hormonal
agents for prostate cancer. there does not appear to be a
superior dose or type of corticosteroid that is most effective
in this setting. these effects may be short in duration (studies suggest an approximate 4-month median response duration) and they are observed in about 20% to 30% of patients.
estrogens and progestins
 xxxg1737xxx  is not expressed to a significant degree in prostate cancer cells. despite this, in addition to
decreasing hot flushes as part of the supportive care regimen
in patients undergoing  xxxd3327xxx  deprivation, progestational
agents have been shown to produce minimal antitumor effects in a minority of patients.22  xxxd2557xxx  may
contribute therapeutic effects through the suppression of
 xxxd2226xxx , ar blockade and

possibly through 5␣-reductase inhibition. studies of  xxxd2557xxx  have shown a psa response in 10% to 15% of patients.23
estrogen receptors are expressed in prostate carcinoma
cells as well as in the stroma in  xxxd3327xxx  depleted tissues,
although to our knowledge the role of estrogen in the growth
and survival of prostate tumors is not known. several studies have demonstrated the modest efficacy of estrogens in
the context of aipc. parenteral estradiol for aipc has been
studied but it is not in widespread use.24,25 most commonly
the synthetic estrogen des is used. in a phase ii trial
performed at university of michigan 9 of 21 patients treated
with 1 mg des daily had a significant psa response.26 the
rate of response was considerably lower in patients who had
received 2 or more prior hormonal therapies compared to
those previously treated with only 1 (13% vs 62%). in a
recent study in which des at an oral dose of 3 mg daily was
used as the control arm a 21% rate of psa response by
consensus criteria was reported.27 taken in the aggregate
these data suggest that estrogen agonists have some activity
in patients with progressive disease following  xxxd3327xxx  deprivation therapy.
the  xxxd3327xxx  deprived milieu of the patient with prostate cancer creates an estrogen predominant cellular microenvironment, leading investigators to speculate whether estrogen inhibitors might have significant antitumor effects.
tamoxifen was studied in the early 1980s and found to be
associated with a 23% overall response rate. this trial included hormone refractory and hormone naïve patients, and
it was performed before the era of psa end points.28 more
recently the combination of vinblastine and tamoxifen was
studied in patients with hrpc and no partial or complete
responses were seen.29 high dose tamoxifen at 160 mg/m2
daily was evaluated in a national cancer institute trial and
it demonstrated a combined partial response/stable disease
rate of 23%.30 the selective  xxxg730xxx  modulator
raloxifene has shown considerable preclinical activity
against prostate carcinoma models, although its clinical usefulness is less well established. aromatase inhibitors are
active agents for breast cancer. they exert their effect
through inhibition of the enzyme (aromatase) responsible for
the peripheral conversion of  xxxd3327xxx  to estrogens. these
compounds have been shown to have no activity whatsoever
against prostate cancer.31,32 taken together these data suggest that estrogen agonists such as des but not estrogen
antagonists may be considered active secondary hormonal
therapies.
future directions
the future development of secondary hormonal therapies
will seek to build on the progress made in the last decade.

secondary hormonal therapies

one such avenue of research is exploring approaches to more
specifically and effectively inhibit ar. ar activation involves a complex interaction of conformational changes in
the receptor as well as the recruitment and binding of cofactors and corepressors. most currently available antiandrogens function by changing the 3-dimensional structure of
ar, thereby preventing the recruitment of transcriptional
coactivators. therefore, a major goal of research in this field
is to develop small molecules that block conformational rearrangements of ar through changes in the ligand binding
complex, activating conformational changes or cofactor recruitment.

conclusions
improving the sensitivity of progressive prostate cancer to
hormonal manipulations remains an active area of research.
during the last 10 years it has been appreciated that ar
continues to be critically important and various mechanisms, ranging from receptor mutations to secondary signaling pathways, are responsible for some of the biological
heterogeneity noted in the clinic.
essential concepts of clinical treatment in patients with
progression on primary hormone therapy are maintenance
of the castrate state, identification of those who may require
chemotherapy earlier in the clinical course, consideration of
the antiandrogen withdrawal phenomenon, and the sequential use of oral antiandrogens and adrenolytics. nonstandard secondary hormonal manipulations, such as estrogens,
antiestrogens and progestins, are associated with low response rates but they may have a more significant role as
drug development in this clinical setting proceeds. finally,
the modest usefulness of many of these drugs makes them a
useful platform on which to test and develop novel strategies
involving synthetic drug design, immunotherapies and novel
targeted therapies.33
