one of the most common forms of protein damage in vitro
and in vivo is deamidation and isoaspartyl formation caused by
deprotonation of the peptide-bond nitrogen and its attack on
the side chain carbonyl carbon of l-asparaginyl or l-aspartyl
residues (1, 2). this spontaneous reaction results in the loss of
ammonia (from asparaginyl residues) or water (from aspartyl
residues) and the formation of the side chain into an intermediate succinimidyl ring. if this ring is hydrolyzed at the ␣-carbonyl group, the peptide bond is re-routed through the side
chain carbonyl resulting in the formation of an l-isoaspartyl
residue. the ring is also susceptible to racemization, allowing
for the formation of d-aspartyl and d-isoaspartyl residues, as
well. these aberrant residues can cause drastic conformational
changes in their proteins, resulting in loss of biological activity
(1), increased propensity to aggregate (2), and/or increased

immunogenicity (3). recent studies have shown that isoaspartyl formation in specific peptides or proteins may be linked to
certain disease processes. for example, the presence of isoaspartyl residues in the ␤-amyloid peptide contributes to its
insolubility, and protein isomerization is elevated in ␤-amyloid
peptides and paired helical filaments purified from alzheimer’s
disease brains (4 – 6). however, just as cells have mechanisms
to combat other forms of damage, they have at least one to
restrict the accumulation of isoaspartyl residues. this mechanism involves the enzyme l-isoaspartyl (d-aspartyl) o-methyltransferase ( xxxg1680xxx ).1
 xxxg1680xxx  functions by transferring a methyl group from the
molecule  xxxd3156xxx  ( xxxd3156xxx ) to either the ␣-carboxyl group of the l-isoaspartyl residue or the ␤-carboxyl group
of the d-aspartyl residue (7–9). the resulting methyl ester is
then susceptible to spontaneous hydrolysis leading to the loss
of methanol and the re-formation of the succinimidyl ring. if
the intermediate ring structure then hydrolyzes at the ␤-carbonyl, which typically occurs about 30% of the time at physiological ph, the residue returns to the normal l-aspartyl form
(10, 11). however, 70% of the time, the cyclic imide returns to
one of the aberrant forms, which can be re-methylated by
 xxxg1680xxx  until the peptide or protein in which it resides is no
longer a substrate for the enzyme. therefore, one side effect of
this repair mechanism may be a potentially large consumption
of the methyl donor,  xxxd3156xxx .
when  xxxd3156xxx  donates its methyl group it becomes s- xxxd3157xxx  ( xxxd3157xxx ). the concentration of  xxxd3156xxx  compared with that of  xxxd3157xxx  is often used as an index for the
activity of the  xxxd3156xxx -dependent methyl transfer system in
living organisms (12–14). for example, if the  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx 
ratio were lowered, it might indicate greater  xxxd3156xxx  “consumption” through increased methyltransferase activity. in rat
studies, the administration of  xxxd2471xxx  (l-dopa) results in a significant increase in the activity of
catecholamine-o-methyltransferase causing a reduction in the
brain concentration of  xxxd3156xxx , with a concomitant elevation in
the level of  xxxd3157xxx , thereby lowering the  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratio
(15). however, if  xxxd2471xxx  continues
to be administered, the level of  xxxd3156xxx  returns to normal due
to the feedback regulation of methionine adenosyltransferase
ii (mat ii), the enzyme that produces  xxxd3156xxx  in the brain
(16). another enzyme that is important in maintaining a proper
 xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratio is  xxxg104xxx

l -isoaspartyl
( d -aspartyl) o-methyltransferase
( xxxg1680xxx ) is a protein repair enzyme that initiates the
conversion of abnormal d-aspartyl and l-isoaspartyl residues to the normal l-aspartyl form. in the course of this
reaction,  xxxg1680xxx  converts the methyl donor  xxxd3156xxx  ( xxxd3156xxx ) to s- xxxd3157xxx 
( xxxd3157xxx ). due to the high level of activity of this enzyme, particularly in the brain, it seemed of interest to
investigate whether the lack of  xxxg1680xxx  activity might
alter the concentrations of these small molecules.
 xxxd3156xxx  and  xxxd3157xxx  were measured in mice lacking
 xxxg1680xxx  (pcmt1ⴚ/ⴚ), as well as in their heterozygous
(pcmt1ⴙ/ⴚ) and wild type (pcmt1ⴙ/ⴙ) littermates.
higher levels of  xxxd3156xxx  and lower levels of  xxxd3157xxx 
were found in the brains of pcmt1ⴚ/ⴚ mice, and to a
lesser extent in pcmt1ⴙ/ⴚ mice, when compared with
pcmt1ⴙ/ⴙ mice. in addition, these levels appear to be
most significantly altered in the hippocampus of the
pcmt1ⴚ/ⴚ mice. the changes in the  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratio could not be attributed to increases in the activities
of  xxxg1379xxx  or  xxxg104xxx  in the brain tissue of these mice.
because changes in the  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratio could potentially alter the overall excitatory state of the brain,
this effect may play a role in the progressive epilepsy
seen in the pcmt1ⴚ/ⴚ mice.

altered  xxxd3156xxx  metabolism in brains of  xxxg1680xxx -deficient mice

experimental procedures

generation of  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺,  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫺, and  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ mice—the
 xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹,  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫺, and  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice were obtained as described previously (23, 27). by inbreeding mice that were heterozygous
for the knockout mutation for over 8 generations, a congenic mutant
line has been generated that is ⬃50% 129s4/svjae and 50% c57bl/6.
all  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice used in the following studies were compared with
their  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ and  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫺ littermates. although both male and
female mice were included in the same data sets, approximately the
same number of each sex was used for each genotype. mice were weaned
at 21 days of age, housed in a barrier facility with a 12-h light/dark
cycle, and had unlimited access to chow food and fresh water. mice were
monitored by on-site veterinarians, and all protocols were pre-approved
by the ucla animal research committee.
preparation of brain homogenates for enzyme assays—mice were
sacrificed by decapitation, and their tissues were extracted, weighed,
and placed in ice-cold buffer (4 ml/g). the buffer consisted of 250 mm
sucrose, 10 mm tris-hcl, 1 mm disodium edta, ph 7.4, and protease
inhibitor mixture (one “complete, mini, edta-free protease inhibitor
mixture” tablet per 7 ml of buffer; roche diagnostics). the tissue was
disrupted in a glass homogenization tube with a motor-driven tefloncoated pestle rotating at 310 rpm for seven 10-s intervals. the extract
was centrifuged at 20,800 ⫻ g for 10 min at 4 °c, and the resulting
supernatant extract was stored at ⫺80 °c until enzyme activity assays
for  xxxg1680xxx , mat ii, or  xxxg104xxx  were performed.
measurement of  xxxg1680xxx  activity in brain homogenates—the supernatant fractions from homogenized tissue (described above) were

thawed, and 5 ␮l (⬃50 ␮g of protein) of each was incubated with 0.6 mg
of ovalbumin (sigma, grade v) in 0.2 m bistris-hcl, ph 6.8, containing
10 ␮m s-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14c]methionine (53 mci/mmol; amersham
biosciences) in a 30-␮l volume at 37 °c for 15 min. sodium hydroxide
(70 ␮l of a 0.2 m solution) was added to stop the reactions and to
hydrolyze the [14c]methyl esters formed on l-isoaspartyl residues in
ovalbumin to [14c]methanol. the reaction mixture was immediately
spotted onto an accordion-folded 8 ⫻ 2-cm piece of filter paper and
incubated above 5 ml of safety-solve scintillation fluid (research products international) in the neck of a sealed 20-ml scintillation vial at
room temperature for 2 h to allow [14c]methanol to diffuse into the
scintillation fluid. the filter paper was then removed, and the radioactivity in the scintillation fluid was counted. enzyme activity was determined as a function of [14c]methanol production. incubations containing only s-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14c]methionine, tissue homogenate, and
buffer constituted the blank for each sample; the radioactivity in these
tubes was subtracted from total counts in the determination of enzyme
activity.
measurement of damaged aspartyl residues in brain homogenates—tissue homogenates (5 ␮l each), the same as those used for
enzyme activity assays, were incubated with 1 ␮g of recombinant human l-isoaspartyl (d-aspartyl) o-methyltransferase (specific activity,
20,000 pmol of methyl esters/min/mg of protein, made by a modification
of a method described previously (28)2) in 0.2 m bistris-hcl buffer, ph
6.0, containing 10 ␮m s-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14c]methionine in a 30-␮l
volume at 37 °c for 2 h. after base hydrolysis, [14c]methanol production
was measured as described above to quantify l-isoaspartyl and daspartyl methyl-accepting sites in cellular proteins. incubations containing only s-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14c]methionine, tissue homogenate,
and buffer constituted the blank for each sample; the radioactivity in
these tubes was subtracted from total counts in the determination of
damaged aspartyl residue levels.
measurement of  xxxd3156xxx  and  xxxd3157xxx  levels in deproteinized tissue
homogenates—mice were decapitated, and their tissues were immediately submerged in liquid nitrogen and stored at ⫺80 °c until analysis
was performed. frozen tissue (either brain or testes) was extracted,
weighed, and homogenized in 0.4 m hclo4 (2 ml/g wet weight) at 4 °c
in a glass homogenization tube with a motor-driven teflon-coated pestle rotating at 310 rpm for seven 10-s intervals. the homogenates were
centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 ⫻ g for 20 min at 4 °c. the resulting deproteinized supernatant fractions were neutralized with koh. the precipitated kclo4 was removed from the samples by centrifugation at
10,000 ⫻ g for 20 min at 4 °c. the final supernatant fractions were
stored at ⫺80 °c until analysis by high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). the hplc system included two waters model 510
pumps, a model 680 automatic gradient controller, a model 411 uv
absorbance detector, and a model u6k sample injector. the samples
were thawed, and 200 ␮l were loaded onto an econosphere c18 column
(particle size 5 ␮m, 25 ⫻ 0.46 cm; alltech) equilibrated with mobile
phase a (50 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm sodium heptane sulfonic
acid, 4% acetonitrile, final ph 3.2). mobile phase b consisted of 100%
hplc grade acetonitrile (fisher). the samples were eluted at room
temperature with a linear gradient of 0 –16% eluent b from 0 to 16 min,
then 16 –21% eluent b from 16 to 25 min, and 21–95% eluent b from 25
to 28 min. the column was washed with 95% eluent b from 28 to 33 min
and re-equilibrated with 100% eluent a from 33 to 60 min. the flow rate
was maintained at 1 ml/min, and the uv absorbance was monitored at
254 nm. concentrations were calculated by converting the peak area to
moles based on a molar extinction coefficient for  xxxd3156xxx  and  xxxd3157xxx  of
15,400 at 254 nm. calculations were verified using  xxxd3156xxx  and  xxxd3157xxx 
standards of known concentrations.
measurement of  xxxd3156xxx  and  xxxd3157xxx  levels in deproteinized homogenates of dissected brains—mice were decapitated, and brain tissue
was immediately chilled, extracted, and weighed. dissection of the
brain was performed on ice and completed within 5 min. the brains
were dissected into five sections as follows: brain stem (including pons
and midbrain), cerebellum, hippocampus, thalamus (including hypothalamus), and cortex (including basal ganglia). each section was
weighed and homogenized at 4 °c in 0.4 m hclo4. the homogenates
were then centrifuged, neutralized, and analyzed by hplc as described
above.
measurement of mat ii and  xxxg104xxx  activity in brain homogenates—
mat ii activity was assayed by measuring the formation of  xxxd3156xxx 
from atp and  xxxd2595xxx , modified from the method described previously by oden and clarke (29). briefly, 20 ␮l of homogenized brain

( xxxg104xxx ).  xxxd3157xxx  must be kept from accumulating because
many methyltransferases have a higher affinity for  xxxd3157xxx 
than  xxxd3156xxx , making  xxxd3157xxx  a potent inhibitor of many methylation reactions (17–20, 55).
although the levels of  xxxd3156xxx  and  xxxd3157xxx  are normally well
regulated, there are conditions under which the levels of these
small molecules can be altered for prolonged periods, and they
are often accompanied by severe physiological complications.
for example, deficiencies in  xxxd2146xxx  or vitamin b12 can cause
a considerable decrease in the  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratio (21).
these deficiencies lead to severe neurological disorders, such as
demyelination of the spinal cord characterized by vacuolar
myelopathic lesions. it has been suggested that the demyelination is caused by the defect in methylation (21). this hypothesis
is supported by animal studies showing that similar lesions are
produced in mice treated with  xxxd1778xxx , an inhibitor of
methionine adenosyltransferase (21). in the case of deficiencies
in glycine n-methyltranferase, a liver enzyme that is believed
to serve as an alternate pathway for the conversion of  xxxd3156xxx 
to  xxxd3157xxx , there is a significant increase in plasma  xxxd3156xxx /
 xxxd3157xxx  ratios (22). in humans, this condition has been associated with enlargement of the liver and elevation of serum liver
transaminases (22). because  xxxg1680xxx  may have the capacity to
use relatively large amounts of  xxxd3156xxx  (as suggested above), it
seemed of interest to investigate whether the lack of this methyltransferase results in alterations in the  xxxd3156xxx  and  xxxd3157xxx 
levels in the recently developed  xxxg1680xxx -deficient mouse.
mice lacking  xxxg1680xxx  ( xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice) have been generated
independently by two groups in the last 5 years and exhibit the
same major phenotype in each case (23, 24). this phenotype is
the development of progressive epilepsy that leads to an early
death at an average of 6 weeks of age. it has been proposed that
the severe neurological manifestations of these mice are due to
the accumulation of one or more isoaspartyl-damaged proteins
(such as tubulin, calmodulin, or synapsin) (23–26). another
theory proposes that the metabolism of a small molecule or
neurotransmitter such as n-acetylaspartylglutamate may be
affected by the lack of  xxxg1680xxx  in these mice (27). although both
theories are plausible, in this study we explore yet another
possibility. specifically, we ask if the deficiency of  xxxg1680xxx 
causes a change in the overall  xxxd3156xxx  methylation flux and
whether this may be contributing to the seizure phenotype seen
in the  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mouse.

extract (described above) was incubated for 60 min at 37 °c in a reaction mixture (100 ␮l) containing 70 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.0, 35 mm kcl, 35
mm mgcl2, 1.4 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm atp (sigma), and 1 mm
 xxxd2595xxx  (sigma).  xxxg104xxx  activity was assayed by measuring the
reverse reaction, namely the synthesis of  xxxd3157xxx  from adenosine and
homocysteine using a procedure adapted from that of poulton and butt
(17). in short, 20 ␮l of brain extract was incubated for 60 min at 37 °c
in a reaction mixture (100 ␮l) containing 70 mm tris, ph 8.0, 35 mm
kcl, 35 mm mgcl2, 1.4 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm dl-homocysteine
(sigma), and 1 mm adenosine (sigma). the reactions for both enzymes
were stopped with 10 ␮l of 4 m hclo4, and the samples were frozen at
⫺20 °c until the level of  xxxd3156xxx  or  xxxd3157xxx  was assayed by hplc as
described above. before analysis, the samples were thawed and centrifuged at 20,800 ⫻ g for 10 min, and the supernatants were neutralized
with koh and re-centrifuged at 20,800 ⫻ g for 10 min to clear the
precipitated kclo4.
protein assay—protein concentrations for the extracts used in measuring enzyme activities were determined by a modification of the lowry
procedure (30) using bovine  xxxg124xxx  (sigma) as a standard.
statistical analysis—the results are expressed as means with the

each age group using the unpaired, two-tailed student’s t test.

were also compared with those of their  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ littermates
at each individual age. at 20 days of age, the  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice
have significantly higher levels of  xxxd3156xxx  in their brains than
the  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ mice of the same age (fig. 3a). this trend
continues and becomes even more pronounced by 50 days of
age. the  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫺ mice appear to have slightly higher values
of  xxxd3156xxx  in their brains than the  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ mice in each age
group; however, the values are not significantly different from
the  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ values until 50 days of age.
the  xxxd3157xxx  values in the 20-day-old mice are not significantly altered between  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺,  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫺, and  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹
mice (fig. 3b). however, by 30 days of age, the  xxxd3157xxx  values
of  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice do appear slightly lower than  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹
and  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫺ values, and by 40 days the decrease becomes
quite significant. although the  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫺ mice appear to have

the survival of  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice is severely affected between
the ages of 20 and 50 days—between the ages of 20 and 50
days, the survival of the  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice drops from 98 to 23%
(fig. 1a). because this time period appears to be the most
critical in the development of fatal seizures in the  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺
mice, the following studies focus on the analysis of brain tissue
from mice that are between these ages. the activity of  xxxg1680xxx 
in the brains of  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ and  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫺ mice increases
slightly during this time period, as does their level of damaged
aspartyl residues (fig. 1, b and c). due to the lack of the
enzyme, the  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice have ⬃20 times more damaged
aspartyl residues in their brains than the  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ and
 xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫺ mice. although the level of isoaspartyl damage is
high in  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, the rate of damaged aspartyl residue
accumulation actually decreases slightly after 30 days of age
(fig. 1c). therefore, although it is possible that isoaspartyldamaged substrates may be responsible for the limited survival
seen in the  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, there is no evidence of a drastic
increase in the accumulation of total substrate levels between
the critical ages of 20 and 50 days.
levels of  xxxd3156xxx  and  xxxd3157xxx  are altered in  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ and
 xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫺ mice—levels of  xxxd3156xxx  and  xxxd3157xxx  in tissue samples were determined by ion pairing reverse phase hplc. to
confirm the identification and purity of the chromatogram peak
specified as “ xxxd3156xxx ” in homogenized brain sample, the breakdown of  xxxd3156xxx  to mta was examined (31). after boiling the
brain sample for 10 min at ph 3, the peak that co-eluted with
an  xxxd3156xxx  standard was eliminated, while the peak that coeluted with an mta standard was increased by an equal magnitude (fig. 2a). the specified “ xxxd3157xxx ” peak was confirmed by
monitoring its breakdown by  xxxg104xxx . this was accomplished by
incubating homogenized brain sample with an excess of  xxxg104xxx 
and  xxxg62xxx  at 37 °c for 60 min and comparing
its hplc profile with that of a control sample lacking excess
 xxxg104xxx  and  xxxg62xxx  (fig. 2b).
the levels of  xxxd3156xxx  and  xxxd3157xxx  were measured in homogenized brain tissue from mice at the ages of 20, 30, 40, and 50
days. between 20 and 50 days there is an overall decrease in
the level of  xxxd3156xxx  in the brains of  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ mice (p ⬍ 0.001
when comparing 20 and 30 day values to 40 and 50 day values)
with no significant change in their  xxxd3157xxx  levels (fig. 3, a and
b). on the other hand,  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice demonstrate an overall
decrease in their  xxxd3157xxx  levels (p ⬍ 0.0001 when comparing
20- and 30-day values to 40- and 50-day values) with no significant change in their  xxxd3156xxx  levels (fig. 3, a and b). the levels

the  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ mice, the difference is not statistically significant. the level of  xxxd3157xxx  for  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫺ mice is very similar to
the levels of  xxxd3157xxx  for  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ mice in all the other age
groups.
because the  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratio is often used as an indicator for the activity of the  xxxd3156xxx -dependent methyl transfer
system (12–14), this ratio was calculated for each brain sample.
in  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ mice, the ratio was found to decrease slightly
from 20 to 30 days and then remain relatively constant from 30
to 50 days (fig. 3c). the  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫺ mice follow the same trend
in their  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratios as the  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ mice until 50
days of age when the ratio is slightly but significantly raised

(p ⬍ 0.05). however, for the  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, there is a dramatic increase in the  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratios compared with
those of the  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ mice. although the values at 20 days
are similar, by 30 days the ratio for  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ compared with
 xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ mice is about 1.6-fold greater, and by 40 days the
 xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ ratio is about 2.3-fold greater than the  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹
ratio. by 50 days the ratio has not changed much from the
40-day value. it is possible that by 50 days, we may be selecting
for  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice that have less of an elevation in their
 xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratios, if this value is any indication of the
survivability of these mice.
the levels of  xxxg1680xxx  in adult  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ mice are much

higher in the brain than in any other tissue except for the
testes which seem to have levels comparable with those in the
brain (24, 32). therefore, if the altered levels of  xxxd3156xxx  and
 xxxd3157xxx  are caused by the lack of  xxxg1680xxx , one might expect to
see a difference in the testes of the  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice similar to
that seen in their brains. after measuring the levels of  xxxd3156xxx 
and  xxxd3157xxx  in the testes of mice between 20 and 50 days of
age, we found a slight but significant increase in testicular
 xxxd3156xxx  levels of 40- and 50-day-old  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice compared
with  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ mice (p ⬍ 0.1 and 0.05, respectively); however,
there did not appear to be a significant difference in the
 xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratios for any of the ages tested (data not
shown).2
levels of mat ii activity in brain homogenates are lower in
 xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ and  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫺ mice—an increase in the  xxxd3156xxx /
 xxxd3157xxx  ratio in the brain might result from the decreased
consumption of  xxxd3156xxx  caused by lowered  xxxd3156xxx -dependent
methyltransferase activity. however, it might also result from
higher levels of  xxxd3156xxx  production and  xxxd3157xxx  metabolism.
to determine whether the latter was occurring in the
 xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, the activity of the enzymes that catalyze
 xxxd3156xxx  production and  xxxd3157xxx  metabolism in the brain,
namely mat ii and  xxxg104xxx , was measured at the different ages
in the  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹,  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫺, and  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice.

at 20 days of the age, the  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice appear to have
slightly but significantly lower levels of mat ii activity than
the  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ mice of the same age (fig. 4a). at 30 and 40
days of age there does not appear to be a significant change in
activity levels for any of the genotypes. however, at 50 days of
age, not only do the  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice have lower mat ii activity but the  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫺ mice have lower levels as well. from
these results, it can be presumed that the higher  xxxd3156xxx  levels
in the brains of the  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ and  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫺ mice are not
caused by increased production of  xxxd3156xxx  but more likely by
its lowered consumption. in fact, the lowered activity of mat ii
may result from the higher concentrations of  xxxd3156xxx  in the
 xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ and  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫺ mice, as mat ii is feedback inhibited by physiological concentrations of  xxxd3156xxx  (33, 34).
levels of  xxxg104xxx  activity are slightly lower in  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺
mice—as mentioned previously, the relative concentration of
 xxxd3157xxx  is very important in the regulation of methylation
reactions, as many methyltransferases that use  xxxd3156xxx  are
extremely sensitive to competitive inhibition by  xxxd3157xxx  (17–
20, 55). to sustain proper methylation levels in most cells, it is
necessary to remove  xxxd3157xxx  by the action of  xxxg104xxx . although
the action of  xxxg104xxx  is reversible, it is believed that in vivo and
under normal conditions the reaction is favored in the direction
of  xxxd3157xxx  hydrolysis by the rapid removal of adenosine and
homocysteine (17). therefore, one reason for lowered  xxxd3157xxx 
levels, like those observed in the  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, would be an
increase in  xxxg104xxx  activity. however, upon measuring the activity levels of  xxxg104xxx  in the  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, it appears that, if

altered  xxxd3156xxx  metabolism in brains of  xxxg1680xxx -deficient mice

discussion

in rat brain, there is a significant decrease in the  xxxd3156xxx /
 xxxd3157xxx  ratio between 1 and 4 weeks of age with a more
gradual decrease during maturation (13). this trend is consistent with our results from  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ mice between the ages of
20 and 50 days. because this time period also appears to be the
most critical in the development of fatal seizures in the
 xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, we were interested in examining the  xxxd3156xxx /
 xxxd3157xxx  ratio in  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice between these ages. our
results show that these mice, and to a limited extent their
 xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫺ littermates, exhibit a progressive elevation in their
 xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratios when compared with  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ mice.
this elevation can either be interpreted as a decrease in the
methylation flux or as an increase in  xxxd3156xxx  production and/or
 xxxd3157xxx  metabolism. however, after measuring the activities of
the enzymes that regulate  xxxd3156xxx  production and  xxxd3157xxx 
metabolism in the brains of these mice, they were found to be

altered in a way that would actually lead to a decrease in the
 xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratio, not an increase. for example, in the
brains of 50-day-old  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ and  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫺ mice,  xxxg104xxx 
activity was either unchanged or slightly lowered, and mat ii
activity was significantly reduced, perhaps due to feedback
inhibition by the elevated levels of  xxxd3156xxx . these findings
indicate that the increase in the  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratio is most
likely a result of a decrease in the consumption of  xxxd3156xxx  as
opposed to an increase in its production.
one of the objectives of this study was to determine whether
there was a direct cause and effect relationship between the
lack of  xxxg1680xxx  and the increase in the  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratio.
one way we attempted to accomplish this was to see if the
 xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratio was altered in the testes of  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺
mice, another tissue in which  xxxg1680xxx  is highly expressed in
 xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ mice. whereas  xxxd3156xxx  levels were higher in the
testes of  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice at 40 and 50 days of age, we were
unable to find significantly altered  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratios for
the ages studied here. another way we attempted to determine
whether there was a direct cause and effect relationship was to
compare the localization of  xxxg1680xxx  expression in the
 xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ mouse brain with the localization of altered levels
of the  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratio seen in the  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mouse
brain. when comparing the  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratio from
 xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice to  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ mice, the most significant elevation occurs in the hippocampus and cortex, and the lowest

anything,  xxxg104xxx  activity is actually decreased. the  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺
mice have slightly lower levels of  xxxg104xxx  activity at 20, 30, and
40 days of age compared with those of the  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ mice (fig.
4b). however, by 50 days, there does not appear to be a significant difference between any of the three genotypes. in any
case, it does not appear that there is increased metabolism of
 xxxd3157xxx  by  xxxg104xxx  in the  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice between 20 and 50
days of age.
the  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratio is most significantly altered in
the hippocampus of  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice—although  xxxg1680xxx  is
widely distributed throughout the brain, it is apparent from
immunolocalization data that it is more highly localized in
certain brain regions and less in others. for example, in rat
brain  xxxg1680xxx  appears to be most highly expressed in neurons
of the hippocampus, cortex, and basal ganglia, followed by
those in the cerebellum, brain stem, and hypothalamus (35–
37). we find a similar distribution of  xxxg1680xxx  expression in
mouse brain.3 if the altered levels of  xxxd3156xxx  and  xxxd3157xxx 
resulted from the absence of  xxxg1680xxx , one might expect to find
that the regions with the greatest alterations of these molecules in the  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice are the same as those with the
highest levels of  xxxg1680xxx  expression in the  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ mice.
after measuring the  xxxd3156xxx  and  xxxd3157xxx  levels in the different
brain regions of 50-day-old mice, it was determined that
 xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice have higher levels of  xxxd3156xxx  in all the regions
compared with those of the  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ mice (fig. 5a). also, the
 xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice have lower levels of  xxxd3157xxx  in every brain
region except the thalamus (fig. 5b). finally, in comparing the
 xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratios between the  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺and  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹
mice, the most significant difference appears to occur in the
hippocampus (fig. 5c). the ratios in the cortex, cerebellum,
and brainstem are also significantly higher; however, the ratio
in the thalamus is relatively unchanged.
 xxxg1680xxx  activity was also measured in dissected and homogenized  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹ brain tissue using the same procedure described for whole brain homogenates (data not shown). these
data did not demonstrate the variability in the regional distribution of  xxxg1680xxx  that is readily seen by immunolocalization
data. the reason for this inconsistency is believed to be a result
of the loss of  xxxg1680xxx  following homogenization and centrifugation of the brain tissue as some of the protein has been shown
to associate with the membrane fraction (38 – 41). in addition,
it has yet to be determined whether this association is variable
between the different brain regions. therefore, the comparison
of the  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratios to  xxxg1680xxx  levels in the various
regions of the brain was made with intact brain tissue as
opposed to dissected and homogenized tissue.

altered  xxxd3156xxx  metabolism in brains of  xxxg1680xxx -deficient mice

alteration occurs in the region of the thalamus. this correlates
well with immunolocalization of the enzyme in rat (35–37) and
mouse brain.3 these data suggest that the lack of the  xxxg1680xxx 
enzyme may be the primary cause of the altered  xxxd3156xxx /
 xxxd3157xxx  ratios in  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ and  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫺ mice; however,
the extent of this effect may be limited to brain tissue.
in fig. 6, we depict a model for the condition of the
 xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mouse in which the lack of  xxxg1680xxx  decreases the
overall methylation flux in the brain. this deficit results in a
build up of  xxxd3156xxx , a diminishment of  xxxd3157xxx , an accumulation of isoaspartyl-damaged proteins (x-isoasp), and a potential increase in the methylation of other  xxxd3156xxx -dependent
methyltransferase substrates (x-ch3). any one of these effects
could potentially lower the seizure threshold in the  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺
mice. the altered  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratio could affect the activity
of one or more of the many other  xxxd3156xxx -dependent methyltransferases, such as those involved in neurotransmitter metabolism, receptor transduction, dna expression, or phospholipid methylation (55). for example, in several studies it has
been suggested that the transduction of receptor-mediated
events could be altered through membrane lipid methylation
(42). in studies where reticulocyte ghosts were incubated with
varying concentrations of  xxxd3156xxx , the number of ␤-adrenergic
receptor sites increased with a paralleled increase in membrane fluidity (43). aside from altering the activities of other
 xxxd3156xxx -dependent methyltransferases, it was also possible
that higher levels of  xxxd3156xxx  could lead to greater synthesis of
polyamines through the action of  xxxd3156xxx  decarboxylase. polyamines have been shown to have excitatory properties when

brain compared with pcmt1ⴙ/ⴙ mouse brain. in the  xxxg1680xxx ⫹/⫹
mouse, the levels of  xxxd3156xxx  and  xxxd3157xxx  are kept in balance through
the production of  xxxd3156xxx , conversion of  xxxd3156xxx  to  xxxd3157xxx , and metabolism of  xxxd3157xxx . the lack of  xxxg1680xxx  decreases the overall methylation flux in the brain of the  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mouse. this alteration results
in a build up of  xxxd3156xxx , a diminishment of  xxxd3157xxx , an accumulation of
isoaspartyl-damaged proteins (x-isoasp), and a potential increase in
the methylation of other  xxxd3156xxx -dependent methyltransferase substrates (x-ch3).

injected intraventricularly into mice (44, 45). in these studies,
it was demonstrated that even a small amount of  xxxd3234xxx 
could cause extreme hyperexcitability in the mice, and convulsions could be precipitated by the slightest sound or touch.
it is also possible that lower  xxxd3157xxx  levels alone might affect
the seizure threshold. for example,  xxxd3157xxx  has been shown to
have anticonvulsant properties in rabbit, rat, and cat (46).
these studies demonstrated that  xxxd3157xxx  administration decreased epileptiform discharges after hippocampal stimulation
and decreased the incidence of pentetrazol convulsions.
 xxxd3157xxx  has also been proposed as a candidate ligand for the
benzodiazepine receptor based on its capacity to inhibit flunitrazepam binding to the benzodiazepine recognition site of the
␥- xxxd2177xxx , type a, receptor (47). probably the most
convincing study on the anticonvulsant action of  xxxd3157xxx  involves the induction of seizures in mice by  xxxd2595xxx -dlsulfoximine and the inhibition of these seizures by the coadministration of adenosine and homocysteine thiolactone (48).
in these studies, it was determined that the most effective
anticonvulsant action of this treatment occurred when cerebral
 xxxd3157xxx  levels were at their highest.
while it is possible that an increase in the  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx 
ratio may be responsible for lowering the seizure threshold in
these mice, there is no evidence that externally administered
 xxxd3156xxx , which does not appear to be able to cross the plasma
membrane (54), would produce the same effect. in fact, in a
study of the use of  xxxd3156xxx  as an antidepressant for patients
with chronic epilepsy, it was found that daily intravenous
administration of  xxxd3156xxx  had no adverse effect on seizure
frequency (49). on the other hand, the administration of folate,
the levels of which are correlated with intracellular  xxxd3156xxx 
levels in rat brain (53), can greatly aggravate seizure control in
epilepsy patients (50) and in experimental animals (51, 52).
thus, orally (or intravenously) administered  xxxd3156xxx  would
probably not mimic the effect we observe in the  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺
mice, which is most likely an intracellular alteration of
 xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  levels.
up to this point, the study of  xxxg1680xxx  has usually been
associated with aging research due to its firmly established role
in protein repair (1, 25). before the generation of the pcmt1deficient mouse, it was thought that a knockout of this gene in
a mammalian system might provide an advanced aging model.
due to the strong expression of the enzyme in the central
nervous system, it was also anticipated that the knockout
mouse might show signs of advanced neurological aging, such
as neuronal degeneration or the formation of neuritic plaques.
however, when the mice were finally generated, it was unanticipated how very limited their survival would turn out to be
(23, 24). trying to make a connection between the deficiency of
the methyltransferase and the development of fatal epilepsy
seen in this short-lived mouse has been a challenge, especially
considering the diversity and number of potential substrates
for the enzyme. theories involving the damage or alteration of
various proteins, peptides, and small molecule substrates have
been proposed (23–27). however, one previously overlooked
substrate was the methyltransferase’s own cofactor,  xxxd3156xxx .
from the studies mentioned above, we have determined that
the levels of  xxxd3156xxx  and  xxxd3157xxx  are indeed altered by the lack
of  xxxg1680xxx , although we do not yet know if these alterations are
causing the seizures seen in the  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice or if they are
secondary to them. however, if the altered levels of these small
molecules is influencing the seizure threshold in the
 xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, there may be ways to rescue this phenotype.
if we are able to prolong their lives, perhaps older  xxxg1680xxx ⫺/⫺
mice would exhibit phenotypes directly related to the aging of

altered  xxxd3156xxx  metabolism in brains of  xxxg1680xxx -deficient mice
specific protein substrates, and perhaps even provide a model
of advanced aging in the nervous system.
