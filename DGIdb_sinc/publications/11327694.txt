hyaluronidase counteracts the growth inhibitory
function of transforming growth factor beta (tgf-␤),
whereas secretion of autocrine tgf-␤ and hyaluronidase is necessary for progression and metastasis of
various cancers. whether hyaluronidase and tgf-␤1
induce resistance to  xxxd3241xxx  in l929 fibrosarcoma cells was investigated. when pretreated with
tgf-␤1 for 1–2 h, l929 cells resisted  xxxd3241xxx 
apoptosis. in contrast, without pretreatment, hyaluronidase protected l929 cells fromstaurosporine
apoptosis. hyaluronidase rapidly activated p42/44
mapk (or erk) in l929 cells and tgf-␤1 retarded
the activation. nonetheless, tgf-␤1 synergistically increased hyaluronidase-mediated inhibition of  xxxd3241xxx  apoptosis. hyaluronidase rapidly activated
c- xxxg1370xxx  ( xxxg1370xxx  and  xxxg1372xxx ) in l929
cells in 20 min. dominant negative  xxxg1370xxx ,  xxxg1372xxx , and
 xxxg1367xxx  abolished the hyaluronidase inhibition of  xxxd3241xxx  apoptosis, but not the tgf-␤1 protective
effect. unlike the resistance to  xxxd3241xxx , pretreatment of l929 cells with hyaluronidase is necessary to generate resistance to other anticancer drugs,
including doxorubicin,  xxxd1816xxx ,  xxxd1800xxx ,
and  xxxd412xxx , and the induced resistance was
also blocked by dominant-negative jnks. together,

transforming growth factor beta (tgf-␤) family proteins are involved in multiple biologic events such as
embryogenesis, extracellular matrix protein synthesis,
cell proliferation and death, and regulation of immune
cell functions (1–3; reviews). tgf-␤1 is known to protect murine l929 fibroblasts and prostate lncap cells
from  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-mediated cell death
(4 – 6). in contrast, testicular hyaluronidase enhances

tnf sensitivity in these cells and counteracts the protective function of tgf-␤1 against tnf (7; review).
hyaluronidase also blocks tgf-␤1-mediated growth
suppression of mink lung epithelial mv1lu cells (5).
tgf-␤1 orchestrates the construction of extracellular
matrix, whereas hyaluronidase modifies the matrix.
accordingly, hyaluronidase is a likely physiologic inhibitor of tgf-␤1.
normal fibroblasts and almost all cancer cells secrete  xxxd2289xxx  as well as hyaluronidase (8 –13).
hyaluronidase modulates the alternative splicing pattern of a cell-surface  xxxd2289xxx  binding protein,
cd44, which may be associated with cancer cell metastasis (14, 15). hyaluronidase promotes the progression of prostate cancer and increases invasion and metastasis of breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers
(16 –20). also, expression of hyaluronidase by tumor
cells induces angiogenesis in vivo (21). one of the major functions of tumor cell-derived hyaluronidase is to
digest extracellular matrix for facilitation of their invasion and metastasis. importantly, as a reservoir, the
degraded extracellular matrix caused by hyaluronidase may release growth factors to stimulate cancer
cell growth.
testicular hyaluronidase is commonly used as an
adjuvant with anticancer drugs in chemotherapy to
enhance penetration of drugs to tumors and increase
their potency in killing tumor cells. exposure of solid
tumors or tumor cells with exogenous hyaluronidase,
either in vivo or in vitro, increases their susceptibility
to anticancer drugs (22–27).
de novo protein synthesis is involved in the hyaluronidase enhancement of tnf apoptosis of several
cancer cells (6). pretreatment of l929 and lncap
cells, for example, with hyaluronidase for at least 12 h
increases their sensitivity to tnf-mediated cell death.
hyaluronidase-induced proteins, which increase tnf
sensitivity in l929 cells, are p53 (6) and  xxxg2430xxx , a ww
domain-containing oxidoreductase (28).

in this study the role of hyaluronidase and tgf-␤1
in generation of multiple drug resistance in l929 cells
was examined. pretreatment of l929 cells with
tgf-␤1 resulted in resistance to  xxxd3241xxx  apoptosis.  xxxd3241xxx  is an antineoplastic drug that inhibits protein kinase c-dependent cell growth (29, 30). in
contrast, without pretreatment, hyaluronidase mediated l929 cell resistance to  xxxd3241xxx . nonetheless, pretreatment of l929 cells with hyaluronidase
was necessary to generate resistance to multiple drugs
including doxorubicin,  xxxd1816xxx ,  xxxd1800xxx ,
and  xxxd412xxx . doxorubicin,  xxxd1816xxx , and  xxxd1800xxx  are intercalators of dna (31, 32), whereas
 xxxd412xxx  is an inhibitor of topoisomerase i (33).
here it is demonstrated that hyaluronidase-induced
activation of c-jun n-terminal protein kinase (jnk; or
known as  xxxg1372xxx , stress-activated protein kinase) is
necessary for the generation of resistance to anticancer
drugs. tgf-␤1 could not abolish hyaluronidaseinduced drug resistance.

to confirm the results from above experiments using crystal violet
staining, in some experiments the extent of cell proliferation (or
death) was determined by using a tetrazolium-based mts assay (promega, madison, wi), as described previously (5). briefly, an aliquot
of mts [(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4sulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium] and pms (phenazine methosulfate) mixture was added to each well of the cultured cells. mts was bioreduced
by live cells into a soluble formazan and measured at od 490 nm by the
microtiter plate reader.
wild-type and dominant negative  xxxg1370xxx ,  xxxg1372xxx , and  xxxg1367xxx  (jnk␤)
constructs. the flag-tagged wild-type (pcdna3-flag- xxxg1370xxx ) and
dominant negative  xxxg1370xxx  (dn- xxxg1370xxx  or pcdna3-flag-jnk1apf)
cdna expression constructs were kindly provided by dr. roger
davis of the university of massachusetts medical center, worcester,
ma. the ha-tagged wild-type  xxxg1372xxx  and  xxxg1367xxx  (pevrfo-ha- xxxg1372xxx 
and pevrfo-ha- xxxg1372xxx ␤) and dominant negative  xxxg1372xxx  and  xxxg1367xxx 
(pevrfo-ha- xxxg1372xxx -k55r and pevrfo-ha- xxxg1372xxx ␤-k55r or dnjnk2 and dn- xxxg1367xxx ) were kindly provided by dr. michael kracht of
the medical school hannover, hannover, germany.
l929 or other indicated cells were electroporated with the wildtype or dn-jnk constructs (30 ␮g dna/3 ⫻ 10 6 cells; 200 volt and 50
millisecond, btx ecm 830 square wave electroporator, genetronics, san diego, ca), cultured 48 –72 h, and then exposed to hyaluronidase and/or anticancer drugs for 16 –24 h. the extent of cell death
was then determined as described above.

materials and methods
results
cell lines. cell lines used in these studies were tnf-sensitive
murine l929 fibroblasts, monkey kidney cos7 fibroblasts and human
prostate lncap cells, as previously described (4 – 6, 28).
reagents. bovine testicular hyaluronidase was from sigma (st.
louis, mo).  xxxd3241xxx , doxorubicin,  xxxd1816xxx ,  xxxd1800xxx 
d, and  xxxd412xxx  were from calbiochem (san diego, ca), sigma
(st. louis, mo), and biomol (plymouth meeting, pa). doxorubicin
and  xxxd1816xxx  are structural homologues. doxorubicin possesses
a hydroxyacetyl group at the c-8 and  xxxd1816xxx  has an acetyl
group at this carbon. purified human platelet tgf-␤1 was from r&d
(minneapolis, mn). antibodies against activated or phosphorylated
 xxxg1370xxx  (p- xxxg1370xxx ) and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase
(p-p42/44 mapk) were from santa cruz biotechnology (santa cruz,
ca). other antibodies used in this study were against  xxxg1370xxx ,  xxxg1372xxx 
(the above antibodies from santa cruz, ca), and ␣-tubulin (accurate
chemical, westbury, ny).
cell death assays.  xxxd3241xxx  and other anticancer drugmediated cell death was performed similarly to the tnf cytotoxic
assays as previously described (4 – 6). briefly, 100 ␮l aliquots of l929
or other types of cells (2.5 ⫻ 10 5/ml) were dispensed onto 96-well
microtiter plates and cultured overnight in rpmi-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. these cells were then exposed to tgf-␤1 and/or hyaluronidase for various indicated times,
followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) once, and
treating with  xxxd3241xxx  or other anticancer drugs for 16 –24 h.
where indicated, cells were pretreated with tgf-␤1 and/or hyaluronidase, followed by coincubation with  xxxd3241xxx  or other anticancer drugs. these treated cells were then stained with crystal
violet (0.5% in 20% methanol) for 15 min, washed with running tap
water to remove dead cells, and lysed by 50 ␮l of 33% acetic acid to
determine the relative cell density at od 580 nm by an automatic
microtiter plate reader (tecan, research triangle park, nc). the
percentages of  xxxd3241xxx  or other anticancer drug-mediated
cell death were calculated as follows: % cell death ⫽ [(od from
control cells ⫺ od from  xxxd3241xxx -treated cells)/od from control
cells] ⫻ 100.
where indicated, l929 cells were pretreated with tgf-␤1 and/or
hyaluronidase, and then cultured for 24 – 48 h in the presence or
absence of 10% fetal bovine serum. the extent of starvationmediated growth inhibition was then determined.

tgf-␤1-pretreated l929 cells resist staurosporinemediated cell death, whereas hyaluronidase blocks the
cell death by  xxxd3241xxx  without pretreatment.
pretreatment of tnf-sensitive l929 cells with tgf-␤1
for 0.5–1 h enables these cells to resist tnf cytotoxicity (4). in contrast, pretreatment of l929 cells with
hyaluronidase for at least 10 h is necessary to increase
their tnf sensitivity (5). both events are related with
de novo protein synthesis.
under similar experimental conditions, l929 cells
were pretreated with hyaluronidase for 24 h, followed
by washing once with pbs to remove hyaluronidase
and exposure to  xxxd3241xxx  for 16 –24 h. it was
determined that hyaluronidase had no effect on
 xxxd3241xxx -mediated cell death (fig. 1a). in contrast, exposure of l929 cells to hyaluronidase for 2 h,
followed by coincubation with  xxxd3241xxx  for 16 –24
h, resulted in resistance to cell death (⬃70% inhibition
using 100 units/ml hyaluronidase; fig. 1a). simultaneous cotreatment of l929 cells with hyaluronidase
and  xxxd3241xxx  for 16 –24 h also resulted in resistance to cell death (⬃70% inhibition using 100 units/ml
hyaluronidase; fig. 1a). together, these results suggest that de novo protein synthesis is not involved in
hyaluronidase inhibition of  xxxd3241xxx -mediated
cell death.
in contrast, pretreatment of l929 cells with tgf-␤1
for 24 h, followed by removal of tgf-␤1 and exposure
to  xxxd3241xxx , resulted in blocking of staurosporinemediated cell death (fig. 1b). pretreatment of l929
cells with tgf-␤1 for 2 h, followed by coincubation
with  xxxd3241xxx  for 16 –24 h, also resulted in inhibition of cell death by  xxxd3241xxx  (fig. 1b). how-

fig. 1. hyaluronidase blocks  xxxd3241xxx -mediated l929 cell
death, whereas prestimulation of cells with tgf-␤1 is necessary to
protect these cells from  xxxd3241xxx  killing. (a) when l929 cells
were pretreated with hyaluronidase for 24 h, followed by washing
once with pbs and exposure to  xxxd3241xxx  (1 ␮m) for 16 –24 h
(referred to as pretreatment), the  xxxd3241xxx -mediated cell death
was not blocked. similarly, exposure of l929 cells to hyaluronidase
for 2 h, followed by cotreating with  xxxd3241xxx  (1 ␮m) for 16 –24 h,
resulted in resistance to cell death (pre and cotreatment). simultaneous cotreatment of l929 cells with hyaluronidase and  xxxd3241xxx  also resulted in resistance to cell death (cotreatment). similar
results were observed using 0.5 ␮m  xxxd3241xxx  (data not shown).
(b) under similar experimental conditions, pretreatment of l929
cells with tgf-␤1 for 24 h, followed by removing tgf-␤1 and exposure to  xxxd3241xxx  for 16 –24 h, resulted in resistance to
 xxxd3241xxx -mediated cell death (pretreatment). similarly, when
l929 cells were pretreated with tgf-␤1 for 2 h and then coincubated
with  xxxd3241xxx  for 16 –24 h,  xxxd3241xxx -mediated cell death
was blocked (pre and cotreatment). in contrast, simultaneous stimulation of l929 cells with both tgf-␤1 and  xxxd3241xxx  for 16 –24
h failed to result in blocking of  xxxd3241xxx -mediated cell death
(cotreatment). data were presented as mean ⫾ standard deviation
(n ⫽ 8).

ever, simultaneous stimulation of l929 cells with both
tgf-␤1 and  xxxd3241xxx  for 24 h failed to result in
inhibition of  xxxd3241xxx -mediated cell death (fig.
1b). thus, pretreatment of l929 cells with tgf-␤1 is
necessary for inhibition of cell death by  xxxd3241xxx .
as determined by light and fluorescence microscopy,
 xxxd3241xxx  mediated typical characteristic of apoptosis including cytoplasmic shrinkage and nuclear condensation (using dpai for staining nuclei).
tgf-␤1 regulates hyaluronidase-induced activation
of p42/44 mapk (erk) but fails to block hyaluronidase-mediated resistance to  xxxd3241xxx  apoptosis.
hyaluronidase counteracts the protective effect of
tgf-␤1 against tnf cytotoxicity (5–7). next experiment was to determine whether there is a functional
antagonism or synergism between hyaluronidase and

tgf-␤1 in the inhibition of  xxxd3241xxx  apoptosis.
l929 cells were cotreated with hyaluronidase and
tgf-␤1 for various indicated times, followed by examining the activation of p42/44 mapk (erk) in western
blotting. the result showed that hyaluronidase rapidly
activated p42/44 mapk in l929 cells, which is in
agreement with our previous observation (5). nonetheless, the activation was retarded by the presence of
tgf-␤1 (fig. 2a). tgf-␤1 alone failed to activate
p42/44 mapk (data not shown).
activation of p42/44 mapk was not involved in the
hyaluronidase-mediated resistance to  xxxd3241xxx 
apoptosis, since the mek inhibitor  xxxd1169xxx  failed to
block the hyaluronidase effect (data not shown). also,
 xxxd1169xxx  could not inhibit hyaluronidase-enhanced
tnf killing of l929 cells (5).
preexposure of l929 cells to tgf-␤1 for 2 h, followed
by removal of tgf-␤1 and exposure to hyaluronidase
and  xxxd3241xxx  for 16 –24 h, resulted in further increased resistance to  xxxd3241xxx  apoptosis (fig. 2b).

cally raised the resistance to  xxxd3241xxx  apoptosis.
similarly, the synergistic effect in blocking  xxxd3241xxx  apoptosis was observed when l929 cells were pretreated with tgf-␤1 for 2 h and then cotreated with
hyaluronidase and  xxxd3241xxx  for 24 h (fig. 2c).
additionally, no functional antagonism was observed
between hyaluronidase and tgf-␤1 in regulating  xxxd3241xxx  apoptosis when l929 cells were pretreated
with both hyaluronidase and tgf-␤1 for 2– 4 h and
then exposed to  xxxd3241xxx  (data not shown). similarly, no functional antagonism between these proteins
was observed by simultaneous exposure of l929 cells to
hyaluronidase, tgf-␤1 and  xxxd3241xxx  for 24 h.
similar results were observed by examining whether
hyaluronidase counteracts tgf-␤1 in the regulation of
apoptosis as mediated by serum starvation or deprivation. hyaluronidase increased serum starvationmediated l929 apoptosis, whereas tgf-␤1 failed to
block the hyaluronidase effect (data not shown).
hyaluronidase activation of jnk is necessary to inhibit  xxxd3241xxx  apoptosis. l929 cells were electroporated with a dominant negative  xxxg1370xxx  (dn- xxxg1370xxx )
construct (or buffer only) and then cultured 48 h, followed by exposure to  xxxd3241xxx  and/or hyaluronidase for 16 –24 h. compared to null-electroporated control cells, dn- xxxg1370xxx  abolished the hyaluronidase
inhibition of  xxxd3241xxx  apoptosis (fig. 3a).
hyaluronidase rapidly activated  xxxg1370xxx  and  xxxg1372xxx , as
well as p42/44 mapk, in l929 cells in 20 min, as
determined using anti-phosphopeptide antibodies in
western blotting (fig. 3a). ectopic dn- xxxg1370xxx  inhibited
hyaluronidase-mediated  xxxg1370xxx  activation (data not
shown).
similarly, the dn- xxxg1370xxx -transfected l929 cells were
exposed to tgf-␤1 for 2 h, followed by removal of
tgf-␤1 and exposure to  xxxd3241xxx  for 16 –24 h.
dn- xxxg1370xxx  failed to abolish the tgf-␤1 inhibition of
 xxxd3241xxx  apoptosis (fig. 3b). also, pretreatment
of the dn- xxxg1370xxx -transfected l929 cells with tgf-␤1
for 2 h, followed by cotreating with  xxxd3241xxx  for
16 –24 h, failed to abolish the tgf-␤1 protective effect
(fig. 3b).
together, the above results indicate that  xxxg1370xxx  activation is necessary for hyaluronidase-induced resistance to  xxxd3241xxx  apoptosis, whereas an unknown
mechanism is involved in the tgf-␤1-mediated inhibition of cell death by  xxxd3241xxx .
similar experiments were performed by introducing
dn- xxxg1372xxx  and dn- xxxg1367xxx  constructs into l929 cells by
electroporation. forty-eight hours posttransfection,
these cells were pretreated with hyaluronidase for 2 h
and then coincubated with  xxxd3241xxx  for an additional 16 –24 h. hyaluronidase inhibition of  xxxd3241xxx  apoptosis was abolished in l929 cells expressing dn- xxxg1372xxx  or dn- xxxg1367xxx  (fig. 3c).

similarly, when l929 cells were electroporated with
a wild-type  xxxg1370xxx  expression construct, cultured 48 h,
and exposed to  xxxd3241xxx , no resistance to  xxxd3241xxx  killing was observed in these transfected cells.
however, upon activation of  xxxg1370xxx  with hyaluronidase,
the  xxxd3241xxx  killing of l929 cells was inhibited.
again, these observations indicate that activation of
jnk is essential to block  xxxd3241xxx  killing.
 xxxg1370xxx  increases l929 cell growth and inhibits
hyaluronidase-mediated cellular rounding up. when
l929 cells were electroporated with the wild-type  xxxg1370xxx 
and cultured 48 h, the cell growth was partially enhanced
by  xxxg1370xxx  (⬃10 –20% increase), compared to empty vectoror null-electroporated control cells (fig. 4). dn-jnk1transfected cells had a reduced growth rate by ⬃20%,
compared to control cells. these controls and dn-jnk1transfected cells underwent rounding up when stimulated with hyaluronidase for 16 –24 h (fig. 4). in contrast,
 xxxg1370xxx -expressing cells were relatively resistant to
hyaluronidase-mediated rounding-up (fig. 4). the results suggest that  xxxg1370xxx  induces l929 cells to secrete
extracellular matrix proteins and these proteins are resistant to hyaluronidase digestion.
indeed, overexpression of dn- xxxg1370xxx  in l929 cells
induced apoptosis in 24 h, as determined by cell cycle
analysis (data not shown). accordingly, in the above
experiments (fig. 3), the amount of dn- xxxg1370xxx  in electroporating l929 cells was optimized to reduce apoptosis down to less than 20%. also, the transfected cells
were cultured 48 –72 h to grow up to 80% confluence
prior to feeding with fresh medium/serum and challenge with hyaluronidase and/or  xxxd3241xxx  (or
other anticancer drugs shown below).
pretreatment of l929 and lncap cells with hyaluronidase is necessary to generate resistance to apoptosis as mediated by  xxxd1800xxx , doxorubicin,  xxxd1816xxx , and  xxxd412xxx . hyaluronidase has been
shown to increase drug penetration to tumors and enhance the drug potency in killing cancer cells (22–27).
next study was to determine whether hyaluronidasemediated jnk activation could result in cancer cell
resistance to anticancer drugs. cotreatment of prostate
lncap cells with hyaluronidase and doxorubicin (or
 xxxd1816xxx ) resulted in enhancement of cell death,
compared to control cells (fig. 5a). in contrast, pretreatment of cells with hyaluronidase for 24 h, followed
by decanting the supernatants to remove hyaluronidase and treating with doxorubicin (or  xxxd1816xxx )
for 16 –24 h, resulted in inhibition of cell death by these
anticancer drugs (fig. 5a). shown in fig. 5b is summarized data regarding enhancement and resistance of
killing of l929 and lncap cells during cotreatment
and pretreatment with hyaluronidase and/or anticancer drugs ( xxxd1800xxx , doxorubicin,  xxxd1816xxx ),
respectively, using a single concentration of hyaluronidase and the drugs.

western blotting. in controls, antibodies against jnk and ␣-tubulin were used. (b) similar experiments were performed by preexposure of
the dn- xxxg1370xxx -transfected l929 cells to tgf-␤1 (2 ng/ml) for 2 h, followed by (i) removal of tgf-␤1 and exposure to  xxxd3241xxx  (1 ␮m) for
16 –24 h, or (ii) exposure to  xxxd3241xxx  (1 ␮m) for 16 –24 h in the continual presence of tgf-␤1. (c) l929 cells were electroporated with
the dn- xxxg1372xxx  or dn- xxxg1367xxx  construct or buffer only (null). the cells were cultured 48 h on 96-well plates, preexposed to hyaluronidase (100
units/ml) for 2 h, and then treated with  xxxd3241xxx  (0.25–2 ␮m) for 16 –24 h in the continual presence of hyaluronidase. data were
presented as mean ⫾ standard deviation (n ⫽ 8). note that hyaluronidase-induced resistance to  xxxd3241xxx  apoptosis could be abolished
by raising the concentration of  xxxd3241xxx  up to 2 ␮m.

similarly, pretreatment of tnf-resistant cos7 fibroblasts with hyaluronidase for 2 h, followed by exposure
to anticancer drugs for 16 –24 h in the continual presence of hyaluronidase, also resulted in resistance to
drug-mediated cell death (data not shown). these

drugs included  xxxd3241xxx ,  xxxd1800xxx , doxorubicin,  xxxd1816xxx , and  xxxd412xxx . similar results
were observed using a tnf-resistant l929r cells (4).

pretreating with hyaluronidase for 2 h, and then challenging with actionomycin d,  xxxd1816xxx , or  xxxd412xxx  for 16 –24 h, in the continual presence of hyaluronidase. the dominant negative jnks inhibited
hyaluronidase-mediated drug resistance in l929 cells
(fig. 6). again, these data showed that hyaluronidasemediated activation of jnk not only blocked apoptosis
by  xxxd3241xxx  but also by other anticancer drugs.
discussion
despite its role in degrading matrix  xxxd2289xxx ,
hyaluronidase is shown to induce jnk activation,
which leads to multiple drug resistance in l929 cells.
this protective role of jnk could be abolished by dominant negative jnk. tgf-␤1 protects l929 cells from

tnf cytotoxicity, whereas hyaluronidase counteracts
the tgf-␤1 function (5–7). in contrast to this finding,
both tgf-␤1 and hyaluronidase synergistically increase l929 cell resistance to killing by  xxxd3241xxx 
and probably other anticancer drugs. conceivably,
both tgf-␤1 and hyaluronidase are not only critical
for cancer progression and metastasis, but also increase cancer cell resistance to killing by anticancer
drugs.
jnk family proteins play dual roles in the regulation
of cell survival and death (34 –37). early activation
of jnk increases cell survival in response to tnf
(34, 35). both  xxxg1370xxx  and  xxxg1372xxx  protein kinases are
involved in regional specific apoptosis during early
brain development (36). cisplatin-mediated persistent
activation of jnk induces cell death (37). activation of
 xxxg1370xxx  and  xxxg341xxx  is associated with enhancement
of chemotherapeutic agent induced-apoptosis in baxtransfected gastric cancer cells (38). nonetheless, an
increased jnk activity is associated with acquired tamoxifen resistance in human breast tumors (39). how
jnk proteins promote cell survival at some condition
but increase cell death at other condition remains to be
established.

fig. 5. hyaluronidase-mediated enhancement or resistance to
cell death by anticancer drugs. (a) prostate lncap cells were cultured in 96-well plates overnight and cotreated with hyaluronidase
(100 units/ml) and doxorubicin (or  xxxd1816xxx ) for 24 h (cotreatment), or pretreated with hyaluronidase (100 units/ml) for 24 h and
then exposed to these anticancer drugs for 24 h (pretreatment). the
extent of cell death was determined by crystal violet staining (n ⫽ 8;
mean ⫾ standard deviation). during cotreatment, hyaluronidase
increased the drug potency in killing lncap cells. in contrast,
hyaluronidase-pretreated cells resisted killing by doxorubicin or
 xxxd1816xxx . (b) under similar experimental conditions, both l929
and lncap cells were cotreated with hyaluronidase (100 units/ml)
and/or anticancer drugs (20 ␮g/ml) for 24 h (cotreatment), or pretreated with hyaluronidase for 24 h and then cotreated with or
without anticancer drugs (20 ␮g/ml) for an additional 24 h (pretreatment). hyaluronidase-mediated enhancement or inhibition of cell
death by the anticancer drugs was plotted against the mediumtreated control cells.

overexpression of tgf-␤ in emt-6/parent mammary carcinoma tumor cells increases cellular resistance to multiple anticancer drugs in vivo (40). however, there appears no positive correlation of

elevated plasma tgf-␤ and expression of multidrug
resistance (mdr) gene in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (41).
tgf-␤1 induces several protective proteins in l929
cells against tnf cytotoxicity, such as the nuclear
tiaf1 (tgf-␤1-induced antiapoptotic factor) (42), the
putative transmembrane  xxxg1511xxx  (tgf-␤1-induced factor
2) (43), and the extracellular matrix tnf-resistance
triggering (trt) protein (4, 44). pretreatment of l929
cells with tgf-␤1 is required to generate resistance to
 xxxd3241xxx  apoptosis, indicating that tgf-␤1mediated de novo protein synthesis is involved.
whether tiaf1, tif1, and trt contribute to inhibition of  xxxd3241xxx  apoptosis remains to be determined.
pretreatment of l929 cells with hyaluronidase is
needed to induce resistance to cell death by  xxxd1800xxx , doxorubicin,  xxxd1816xxx , and  xxxd412xxx . in contrast, without pretreatment, hyaluronidase directly blocks  xxxd3241xxx  apoptosis in l929
cells. these observations suggest that de novo protein synthesis is needed to resist killing by  xxxd1800xxx , doxorubicin,  xxxd1816xxx , and  xxxd412xxx . however, new protein synthesis is probably
not required for hyaluronidase inhibition of  xxxd3241xxx  apoptosis.
hyaluronidase fails to block  xxxd3241xxx  apoptosis in human prostate lncap cells. when lncap
cells were pretreated with hyaluronidase and then
coexposed to  xxxd3241xxx , or simultaneously cotreated with hyaluronidase and  xxxd3241xxx , the
cell death was significantly enhanced by hyaluronidase (6). similarly, hyaluronidase fails to enhance or
block  xxxd3241xxx  apoptosis of human neural
sk-n-sh cells (data not shown). in contrast, pretreatment of lncap cells with hyaluronidase allows
these cells to resist killing by  xxxd1800xxx , doxorubicin, and  xxxd1816xxx . thus, the underlying biochemical differences regarding hyaluronidase-regulated apoptosis by anticancer drugs remain to be
established.
hyaluronidase digestion of extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycans appears to invoke multiple signaling
pathways. we found that hyaluronidase induces activation of p42/44 mapk and jnk in l929 cells. hyaluronidase also promotes l929 cell growth (⬃20% increase in 24 h), as evidenced by an increased cell
population (⬃100% increase) in the s and g2/m phases
of the cell cycle (data not shown). ectopic  xxxg1370xxx  also
increases l929 cell growth and provides cellular resistance to hyaluronidase-mediated cellular rounding up,
suggesting that  xxxg1370xxx  raises extracellular matrix protein synthesis and the induced proteins may contribute
to resistance to apoptosis by  xxxd3241xxx  and other
anticancer drugs.
despite its efficacy in increasing anticancer drugs
penetrating to solid tumors in vivo, hyaluronidase may

the concern of using hyaluronidase as an adjuvant in
chemotherapy.
