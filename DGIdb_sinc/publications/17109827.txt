introduction

clinical and preclinical data support the idea that progesterone
inhibits cocaine-induced behavioral responses. for example,
human female cocaine users have attenuated subjective
responses and less desire to smoke cocaine during the luteal
phase than during the follicular phase of the cycle (sofuoglu et
al., 2001, 2002; evans et al., 2002; evans and foltin, 2006). in
rodents, most studies show that cocaine-induced behavioral
activity and self-administration are the lowest during the
diestrus phase (walker et al., 2001b; sell et al., 2000; quiñonesjenab et al., 1999; roberts et al., 1989). since the luteal phase of
the women's cycle and the diestrus phase of the rat's cycle are

characterized by high serum levels of progesterone, these
reports collectively suggest that increases in progesterone
serum levels attenuate the subjective and behavioral effects of
cocaine in both humans and rats. stronger evidence of a
possible role of progesterone in cocaine-induced behavioral
alterations has come from studies that administered progesterone to gonadectomized (gdx) rats; progesterone administration inhibited cocaine-induced conditioned place preference
(cpp) and attenuated locomotor responses in gdx rats (russo et
al., 2003; niyomchai et al., 2005). progesterone's effects on
cocaine-induced behavioral responses are dose-dependent
and temporal (niyomchai et al., 2005; perrotti et al., 2003).
progesterone administration also counteracts the facilitatory

effects of estrogen on cocaine self-administration (jackson et
al., 2006). sofuoglu et al. (2002, 2001) and evans and foltin (2006)
have reported that oral administration of progesterone attenuates some of the subjective effects of cocaine but not the
cardiovascular effects or intravenous cocaine self-administration in both men and women. in both female and male rats,
single- and “binge”-pattern cocaine administration increases
serum levels of progesterone (festa and quinones-jenab, 2004;
quiñones-jenab et al., 2000a,b; walker et al., 2001a,b). however,
little is known about either the molecular interactions between
progesterone and cocaine or the mechanisms of action that
mediate these interactions.
 xxxg1737xxx  (pr) isomers a and b (de-zhong et al.,
1998) belong to a family of hormone-activated transcription
factors that, when bound to the hormone, translocate into the
nucleus and modulate target genes that contain the progesterone response element (pre; de-zhong et al., 1998; leonhardt et
al., 2003; levine et al., 2001). the binding of the receptor–
hormone complex to a target dna sequence regulates transcription (leonhardt et al., 2003). administration of cocaine
activates other dna-binding regulated transcriptional mechanisms, such as creb and deltafosb/ap-1, that have been postulated
to play a key role in the modulation of cocaine-induced
molecular and cellular alterations (reviewed in nestler, 2001).
it has been hypothesized that the induction of serum levels of
progesterone after cocaine administration may ultimately
increase pr nuclear levels. this increase may, in turn, promote
the production of new proteins via transcriptional activation
and may alter responses to that potent psychostimulant. the
present study was designed to test this hypothesis.

results

2.1.

cocaine's effects on progesterone serum levels

progesterone serum levels were higher in animals receiving 15
or 30 mg/kg of cocaine than in those receiving saline (fig. 1).
however, the timing induction differed between doses; 15 mg/
kg of cocaine induced progesterone serum levels after 10 min
( p = 0.02, fig. 1a), whereas 30 mg/kg of cocaine induced progesterone serum levels after 15 min ( p = 0.01, fig. 1b).

2.2.
 xxxg1737xxx  protein levels after cocaine
administration
with administration of 15 mg/kg of cocaine,  xxxd1891xxx  min the upregulation of nuclear pr isomer a (pr-a) protein levels was
significantly higher than in saline-treated controls ( p < 0.05,
figs. 2a, c). however, with administration of 30 mg/kg of
cocaine, at 30 min nuclear pr-a protein levels were significantly
higher than in saline-treated controls ( p = 0.02, figs. 2b, d). on
the other hand, both pr-a and pr-b protein levels were downregulated 60 min after 30 mg/kg of cocaine ( p < 0.05, figs. 2b, d).

discussion

the observed induction of progesterone serum levels by
cocaine is consistent with that previously reported after single
and “binge” cocaine administration paradigms in intact or
pregnant female rats and in male rats (quiñones-jenab et al.,
2000a,b; walker et al., 2001a,b). walker et al. (2001a) reported
increases in progesterone levels 30 min after acute cocaine
administration in sprague–dawley male rats. discrepancies
between the findings of walker et al. (2001a) and ours suggest
different animal strains may affect the temporal aspect of
cocaine's modulation of progesterone serum levels in male
rats. interestingly, goiny et al. (1986) demonstrated that in
male dogs dopamine agonists increased progesterone serum
levels with the same temporal pattern as that reported here.
because cocaine treatment of ovx rats receiving progesterone replacement does not alter progesterone levels, it has
been postulated that cocaine-induced alterations in progesterone serum levels are probably due to an increase in
secretion rate of progesterone rather than to the metabolism
rate of progesterone (quiñones-jenab et al., 2000a,b). cocaine's
effects on progesterone secretion may occur at any level of the
hpg axis. moreover, since it has been demonstrated that

dopamine directly induces progesterone secretion by the
gonads in vivo and in vitro, cocaine administration, via
peripheral dopaminergic surges, may also directly alter
gonadal secretion of progesterone (mori et al., 1994). alternatively, because progesterone is a precursor of cortisol/
corticosterone and because dopamine agonists and antagonists affect secretion of progesterone by the adrenal glands,
cocaine may directly affect the adrenal glands either via
stimulation of progesterone secretion or via acth regulation
of corticosterone secretion (bermudez and lipsett, 1972; satya
et al., 1981). in male rats the adrenal gland is the major source
of progesterone secretion. indeed, it has been shown that the
adrenal glands may be the source of cocaine's induction of
progesterone secretion in female rats, whereas after adrenalectomy, cocaine-induced alterations of progesterone levels
are inhibited (walker et al., 2001a,b). therefore, it is feasible
that cocaine's regulation of adrenal corticosterone secretion
may also be indirectly responsible for cocaine-induced
increases in serum levels of progesterone.
in this study, the induction of progesterone serum levels
was closely followed by an induction of pr-a protein levels
and dna binding formation in the nucleus. we conclude that
cocaine's effects on pr-a protein levels were dose dependent
because 30 mg/kg of cocaine produced a more robust increase
than did 15 mg/kg. changes in pr-dna complex binding levels
were also observed. these effects were also dose and time
dependent. because translocation of progesterone receptors
into the nucleus regulates dna transcription (levine et al.,
2001), activation of progesterone receptors by cocaine may
ultimately affect the production of new proteins via transcriptional activation.
progesterone inhibits cocaine-induced reward associations,
attenuates locomotor responses, and counteracts the facilitatory effects of estrogen on cocaine self-administration
(russo et al., 2003; niyomchai et al., 2005; jackson et al.,
2006). data presented in this report demonstrating cocaine's
effects on both progesterone secretion and receptor activation
strongly suggest that regulation of progesterone receptors may
be a key component in the cascade of events responsible for
progesterone's inhibition of cocaine-induced behavioral
responses. furthermore, because female rats have different
progesterone serum levels and receptor distribution from male
rats, cocaine's regulation of progesterone receptors and
secretion may underlie some of the known sex differences
observed in neurophysiological effects of cocaine. this important issue requires further investigation.

experimental procedures

4.1.

animals

eight-week-old intact male fischer rats (charles river; raleigh,
nc) were individually housed in standard cages with free
access to standard lab chow and water ad libitum. rats were
maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle (with lights on at 9 a.m.)
and handled for 1 week prior to experimental manipulations.
rats were randomly assigned to saline or cocaine treatment (3
to 5 animals per group). for each cocaine dose and time point,
separate control (saline treatment) groups were run. all nih

191

guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals were
strictly followed, and procedures were approved by the
institutional animal care and use committee of hunter
college (iacuc).

4.2.

cocaine administration

thirty minutes after lights were turned on, rats received an
injection of either saline or cocaine (15 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg;
intraperitoneal) in their home cage. rats were decapitated
following a brief exposure to co2 (20 s) at different time points
(for 15 mg/kg: 0, 15, 30 or 60 min; for 30 mg/kg: 0, 10, 15, 30 or
60 min) after cocaine or saline administration. for baseline
studies, a separate cohort of rats was sacrificed without any
drug administration.

4.3.

radioimmunoassay

after decapitation, the animal's trunk blood was collected and
centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 30 min, and the serum was stored
at −80 °c until analyzed. samples were analyzed using coat-acount radioimmunoassay kits for progesterone from diagnostic products (los angeles, ca). intra-assay coefficients of
variation were less than 10.0 ± 1.0%. hormone levels were
determined by a log-logit analysis using graphpad prism
software (san diego, ca). serum levels of progesterone were
expressed in ng/ml.

4.4.

nuclear protein extract

the striatum was dissected by freehand and stored at −80 °c
until use. to obtain nuclear extracts, tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer [20 mm hepes ph 7.9, 10 mm kcl, 1 mm
egta, 10% glycerol, 0.2% np-40] containing protease inhibitors. after a 15-min incubation period, homogenates were
centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °c. pellets were
resuspended in lysis buffer [20 mm hepes ph 7.9, 10 mm kcl,
1 mm egta, 20% glycerol, 0.2% np-40, 0.4 mm nacl], incubated
for 30 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °c.
then supernatants were collected and stored at −80 °c until
use.

4.5.

western blot analysis

protein samples were analyzed for pr protein levels by using
western blot technique as previously described (jenab and
morris, 1997). briefly, 50 mug of protein extract was run in
denatured gradient sds-page gels (biorad, hercules, ca) and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. membranes were
then blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for 30 min and
incubated with pr antibody (diluted 1:1000; santa cruz
biotechnology; santa cruz, ca) for 1 h at room temperature.
after being washed with tris–tween-20 buffer (ph 7.4),
membranes were incubated with the appropriate secondary
antibody for 1 h at room temperature. band densities were
detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit from
amersham (piscataway, ny) and quantified with a molecular
dynamic computer densitometer and an image quant
program. to normalize for protein loading, alpha-tubulin antibody
was used.

electro-mobility shift assay

double-stranded pre oligonucleotides (santa cruz biotechnology, ca) were end labeled using t4 polynucleotide kinase
(promega; madison, wi) and [gamma-32p] atp (perkin elmer; boston,
ma). fifty micrograms of protein extracts was incubated with
binding buffer [50 mm tris–hcl (ph 7.5), 250 mm nacl, 2.5 mm
dtt, 2.5 mm edta, 5 mm mgcl2, 20% glycerol, 0.25 mg/ml poly
(dl-dc)] at room temperature for 5 min. the mixture was then
incubated for 15 min with radiolabeled pre and run in a 5%
non-denatured polyacrylamide gel. band densities were
quantified with a molecular dynamic computer densitometer
and an image quant program. the presence of the pre band
was previously confirmed with supershift and competitive
binding assays in our laboratory (unpublished observations).
