abstract
hyperhomocyst(e)inemia is a metabolic derangement that is linked to the distribution of folate pools, which provide one-carbon units
for biosynthesis of purines and thymidylate and for remethylation of homocysteine to form  xxxd2595xxx . in humans,  xxxg1479xxx 
deﬁciency results in the accumulation of methyltetrahydrofolate at the expense of folate derivatives required for purine and thymidylate
biosynthesis. complete ablation of  xxxg1479xxx  activity in mice results in embryonic lethality. other mouse models for hyperhomocyst(e)inemia have normal or reduced levels of methyltetrahydrofolate and are not embryonic lethal, although they have decreased
ratios of  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  and impaired methylation. we have constructed a mouse model with a gene trap insertion in the  xxxg1480xxx  gene
specifying  xxxg1480xxx , an enzyme essential for the activity of  xxxg1479xxx . this model is a hypomorph, with
reduced  xxxg1480xxx  activity, thus avoiding the lethality associated with the absence of  xxxg1479xxx  activity.
mtrrgt/gt mice have increased plasma homocyst(e)ine, decreased plasma  xxxd2595xxx , and increased tissue methyltetrahydrofolate. unexpectedly, mtrrgt/gt mice do not show decreases in the  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratio in most tissues. the diﬀerent metabolite proﬁles in the various genetic mouse models for hyperhomocyst(e)inemia may be useful in understanding biological eﬀects of elevated homocyst(e)ine.

introduction
 xxxg1479xxx  catalyzes the conversion of homocysteine (hcy) to  xxxd2595xxx  ( xxxd2595xxx ), using a methyl group
derived from methyltetrahydrofolate (ch3–thf). it is
the only ubiquitously expressed enzyme responsible for
homocysteine remethylation in mammals [1,2]. this reaction links the methylation cycle, in which  xxxd2595xxx  serves

as a precursor for the universal methyl donor s- xxxd3156xxx  ( xxxd3156xxx ), to folate metabolism (fig. 1a). during primary turnover,  xxxg1479xxx  acquires methyl
groups from methyltetrahydrofolate, which is generated by
the reduction of methylenetetrahydrofolate (ch2@thf)
catalyzed by  xxxg1475xxx . the
 xxxg1475xxx  reaction is irreversible
under physiological conditions and is inhibited allosterically by the presence of  xxxd3156xxx  [3,4]. in this way, methyl
groups from the folate pathway are committed as needed
to the production of  xxxd2595xxx  for  xxxd3156xxx  biosynthesis

fig. 1. (a) intracellular folate and  xxxd2595xxx  metabolic pathways intersect at the  xxxg1479xxx  reaction.  xxxg1480xxx  supports this critical biochemical
step. while folate interconversions and steps in the  xxxd2595xxx  cycle are shown explicitly, the other participating substrates are omitted except where they
will be discussed. (b)  xxxg1479xxx , which contains a cobalamin (b12) cofactor, catalyzes the methyl group transfer from methyltetrahydrofolate to
 xxxd1771xxx  producing methylcobalamin, and utilizes the methyl group to methylate homocysteine to form  xxxd2595xxx . approximately once in every
thousand turnovers, the  xxxd1771xxx  cofactor of  xxxg1479xxx  becomes oxidized by molecular oxygen forming the inactive cob(ii)alamin form.
 xxxg1480xxx  provides the electron that, along with transfer of a methyl group from  xxxd3156xxx , returns  xxxg1479xxx  to the active methylcobalamin form.

and other processes requiring  xxxd2595xxx .  xxxg1479xxx  is the only enzyme in mammals that uses methyltetrahydrofolate as a substrate and is thus solely responsible for
returning tetrahydrofolate to the active folate pool, which
provides one-carbon units for de novo synthesis of purines
and thymidylate. severe  xxxg1479xxx  deﬁciency
causes accumulation of methyltetrahydrofolate at the
expense of methylenetetrahydrofolate and tetrahydrofolate
[5], and the resultant blockade of de novo thymidylate and
purine biosynthesis leads to apoptosis of rapidly dividing
cells and the development of megaloblastic anemia in
humans [6,7]. a complete lack of  xxxg1479xxx  in
the mouse results in embryonic lethality [8].
 xxxg1480xxx  ( xxxg1480xxx , ec 2.1.1.135)
is required for the nadph-dependent reductive reactiva-

tion of  xxxg1479xxx  (fig. 1b). every thousand or
so turnovers, the active  xxxd1771xxx  cofactor of  xxxg1479xxx  becomes oxidized by molecular oxygen producing cob(ii)alamin [9,10]. cob(ii)alamin is incapable of
accepting a methyl group from methyltetrahydrofolate
and must be reactivated by reductive methylation; the
one-electron reduction is catalyzed by  xxxg1480xxx  [1] and
transfer of a methyl group from  xxxd3156xxx  [11] then regenerates the active methylcobalamin form of the enzyme
(fig. 1b). the reductase acquires reducing equivalents from
nadph, transferring electrons through non-covalently
bound ﬂavin cofactors, ﬂavin adenine dinucleotide (fad)
and ﬂavin mononucleotide (fmn) [1].
 xxxg1480xxx  is a member of a family of related dual ﬂavoproteins that, in mammals, includes nadph-cytochrome

c.l. elmore et al. / molecular genetics and metabolism 91 (2007) 85–97

p450 oxidoreductase, the ﬂavoprotein domains of the nitric
oxide synthase family of enzymes, and nadph-dependent
diﬂavin oxidoreductase 1 (nr1). this family of enzymes
contains an n-terminal fmn-binding domain with
sequence similarity to prokaryotic ﬂavodoxins and a c-terminal fad-binding domain with sequence similarity to
ferredoxin (ﬂavodoxin)-nadp+ oxidoreductases, and
probably arose due to an ancestral gene fusion event [12].
in escherichia coli, reactivation of cobalamin-dependent
 xxxg1479xxx  requires the action of both ﬂavodoxin
and ﬂavodoxin nadp+ oxidoreductase [13,14]. in mammals,  xxxg1480xxx  is believed to be absolutely required for
 xxxg1479xxx  activity in vivo, although activation
through an alternative electron-donating protein, nr1,
was reported in vitro [15].
complementation studies using ﬁbroblasts cultured
from patients aﬀected by defective cobalamin-related
metabolism had previously identiﬁed distinct genetic syndromes. patients were assigned to complementation groups
( xxxg1414xxx -h, mut) based on the outcome of cell fusion experiments and the apparent biochemical defect involved [16–
18]. the  xxxg1480xxx  complementation group was shown to result
from defective reactivation of  xxxg1479xxx  [19].
the human  xxxg1480xxx  gene was identiﬁed by predicting functional sites based on the orthologous
e. coli reducing system and then searching for homology to
protein sequences harboring similar active sites. the identity of the deduced gene was conﬁrmed by detection of
mutations in  xxxg1480xxx  in  xxxg1480xxx 
patients [20]. human patients with inherited syndromes
of impaired  xxxg1479xxx  activity caused by
defective  xxxg1480xxx  are characterized
by elevated plasma total homocyst(e)ine, or hyperhomocyst(e)inemia, decreased plasma  xxxd2595xxx , megaloblastic
anemia and delayed development, as well as a variety of
other neurological ailments, including neuropathy, movement disorders, nystagmus, seizures, and dementia [21–25].
although several other genetic mouse models for hyperhomocyst(e)inemia have been reported, the metabolic
abnormalities generated by these models were expected to
be quite diﬀerent from those induced by a deﬁciency in
 xxxg1479xxx . while  xxxg1479xxx  deﬁciency
is predicted to lead to methyl trapping, or elevated levels of
methyltetrahydrofolate in the folate pool, absence of  xxxg1475xxx  leads to lowered levels of
methyltetrahydrofolate [26] and absence of cystathionineb-synthase is not expected to have any eﬀect on folate
pools. absence of  xxxg1475xxx  or
cystathionine-b-synthase also leads to a decreased intracellular  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratio and reduced capacity for biological methylation [26,27]. the present study was initiated
to determine whether the phenotype associated with  xxxg1479xxx  deﬁciency would be diﬀerent from that seen
in other animal models of hyperhomocyst(e)inemia. since
the absence of  xxxg1480xxx  might be lethal, in that it would
be expected to result in a complete lack of active  xxxg1479xxx , we chose to study an  xxxg1480xxx  gene trap model.

87

we hypothesized that this model would be useful for the
investigation of pathologies associated with hyperhomocyst(e)inemia and imbalances in folate pools.
we show that the presence of a gene trap in the  xxxg1480xxx 
gene leads to a signiﬁcant reduction in the activity of  xxxg1479xxx  with consequent metabolic derangement in
the folate and  xxxd2595xxx  cycles. tissue-speciﬁc skipping of
the gene trap to generate wild-type  xxxg1480xxx  mrna occurs to
diﬀerent extents in various tissues and results in a mouse
that is hypomorphic (deﬁcient) in  xxxg1480xxx  rather than completely lacking the enzyme. this incomplete reduction in
the level of  xxxg1480xxx  expression results in homozygous mutant
mice that are viable, as our preliminary unpublished studies
indicate that a true knockout of  xxxg1480xxx  does indeed result in
embryonic lethality.
materials and methods
generation of  xxxg1480xxx  deﬁcient mice
all animal procedures were carried out in accordance with protocols
approved by the university committee on use and care of animals at
the university of michigan. mouse embryonic stem cells (e14tg2a) containing a gene trap vector insertion between exons 9 and 10 (+398 bp
downstream of exon 9 as determined by pcr and subsequent sequencing,
data not shown) of one allele of the  xxxg1480xxx  gene (cell line xg334) were
obtained from baygenomics. the presence of the gene trap vector
(pgt1lxf) containing the engrailed 2 splice acceptor sequence, b-geo
(b-galactosidase/neomycin phosphotransferase fusion gene) and a sv40
poly(a) signal sequence leads to a mature  xxxg1480xxx  (exons 1–9)-b-geo mrna
as ﬁrst determined by 5 0 race pcr at baygenomics. xg334 embryonic
stem cells were expanded and injected into c57bl/6 mouse blastocysts at
the university of michigan transgenic animal model core. blastocysts
were implanted into pseudopregnant females, producing nine male chimeras, which were then mated to c57bl/6j females. five chimeras bred successfully, and three produced germ line transmission of the gene trap
insertion. the mtrrgt allele was maintained by continuous backcrossing
onto the c57bl/6j background.

genotyping of  xxxg1480xxx  deﬁcient mice
routine genotyping was carried out by pcr of genomic dna utilizing a
three-primer pcr strategy (fig. s1 in supplementary material). to detect
the 5 0 end of the gene trap insertion, the primers were c, 5 0 -gaga
ttgggtccctcttccac-3 0 , b, 5 0 -cgacttccggagcggatctc3 0 , and x, 5 0 -gctgcgcttctgaatccacag-3 0 . for detection of
the 3 0 end of the gene trap insertion, the primers were a, 5 0 -ctgccagcct
ccgctcagc-3 0 , d, 5 0 -cacagcttgtctgtaagcgg-3 0 , and z, 5 0 cctttaatcccagcactcag-3 0 . genomic dna was isolated from
tail tissue using the dneasy dna puriﬁcation kit (qiagen). the annealing
temperatures were 52 c for 5 0 -targeted and 58 c for 3 0 -targeted pcr.

relative quantitative reverse transcription-pcr of mouse tissue
 xxxg1480xxx  rna
whole liver, heart, kidney, and brain tissues were excised from two
 xxxg1480xxx +/+ and two mtrrgt/gt mice of each sex for quantitative reverse transcription-pcr in mice derived from matings of  xxxg1480xxx +/gt mice from the
fourth generation of backcrosses into the c57bl/6j background (n4f2
mice). total rna was extracted from tissues of each animal using
1.0 ml rna-bee (teltest) per 50 mg tissue. purity was veriﬁed by uv
spectroscopy of rna in water. reverse transcription reactions were carried out with 250 ng rna using the retroscript kit (ambion). relative
quantitative pcr was carried out for  xxxg1480xxx  5 0 of the gene trap insertion

88

c.l. elmore et al. / molecular genetics and metabolism 91 (2007) 85–97

spanning exons 8 and 9, using the primers 5 0 -gcgttctctccagttc
atcc-3 0 and 5 0 -cagcctccgcttttcagt-3 0 , generating a 115 bp
amplicon, and for  xxxg1480xxx  3 0 of the gene trap insertion spanning exons 10
and 11, using primers 5 0 -cattccttcagccaaacaca-3 0 and 5 0 -ac
gggtcctctggtaagtgg-3 0 , generating a 114 bp amplicon. control pcr reactions were carried out for the b-actin mrna, using the
primers 5 0 -tgttaccaactgggacgaca-3 0 and 5 0 -ggggtgttg
aaggtctcaaa-3 0 , generating a 165 bp amplicon. all primers were
designed using primer3 software. formation of double-stranded dna
during pcr was monitored using brilliant sybr green qpcr master
mix (stratagene) and an annealing temperature of 60 c with a concentration of 100 nm for forward and reverse primers in 25 ll total reaction
volume. measurements were carried out in triplicate on an  xxxd2595xxx ·4000 multiplex quantitative pcr system (stratagene). the data were normalized to
b-actin for comparison of the relative abundance of wild-type and
total  xxxg1480xxx  mrna between  xxxg1480xxx +/+ and mtrrgt/gt animals using the
comparative ct method. ct, or threshold cycle, is the cycle at which double-stranded dna-binding sybr green i dye ﬂuorescence reaches a statistically signiﬁcant value above baseline, in the region of exponential
ampliﬁcation across all the ampliﬁcation plots that are compared. dct
values for each sample were calculated using the formula
dct = ct,x  ct,r, where ct,x is the ct value for the 5 0 - or 3 0 -speciﬁc
 xxxg1480xxx  target and the ct,r is the ct value for the b-actin reference gene.
the eﬃciencies of amplications with 5 0  xxxg1480xxx -, 3 0  xxxg1480xxx -, and b-actin-speciﬁc primers were approximately equal, as determined by serial template
dilution (data not shown). therefore, the amount of wild-type and total
 xxxg1480xxx  mrna in mtrrgt/gt mice can be normalized to the amount of b-actin
in the same samples and expressed as the fold-change relative to
 xxxg1480xxx +/+ control samples using the formula 2ddct , where ddct is
dct,xa  dct,xb, in which dct,xa is the dct for mtrrgt/gt or  xxxg1480xxx +/+
samples and dct,xb is the mean dct for  xxxg1480xxx +/+ samples only. the value
of 2ddct for  xxxg1480xxx +/+ mrnas is thus equal to one. for mtrrgt/gt tissues,
fold-change values greater than one indicate increased mrna expression
and values less than one indicate decreased mrna expression, compared
to wild-type controls.

western blotting
polyclonal antibodies were generated to highly puriﬁed recombinant
human  xxxg1480xxx  expressed in sf9 insect cells
infected with baculovirus containing the cdna for human  xxxd2595xxx 
synthase reductase fused in frame to an amino-terminal hexahistidine
tag [28]. antibodies were applied as serum. fifty micrograms of tissue
supernatants (100,000g) from mice backcrossed into the fourth generation
of the c57bl/6j background were separated by reducing sds–page on a
4–12% gradient gel (invitrogen) and transferred to a pvdf membrane
(millipore). after blocking in tbs-t with 5% blocking agent (bio-rad),
rabbit serum (1:5000) was applied in tbs-t containing 5% blocking agent
overnight at 4 c. after washing, blots were incubated with goat anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (ge healthcare) for 1 h at room
temperature. blots were visualized using ecl-plus chemical luminescence
(ge healthcare) on a typhoon phosphorimager (ge healthcare). to
check for equal protein loading, blots were stripped and re-probed with
polyclonal primary antibodies to the b-actin protein raised in rabbit
(sigma).

 xxxg1480xxx  enzyme activity assays
 xxxg1480xxx  activity assays were carried out in tissues derived from from
n6f2 oﬀspring as previously described [2]. reactions contained 50 mm
potassium phosphate buﬀer (ph 7.2), 100 mm kcl, 500 lm l-hcy,
20 lm  xxxd3156xxx , 250 lm (6-r,s)-5-[14c-methyl]methyltetrahydrofolate
(ge healthcare) diluted with unlabeled (6-r,s)-5-methyltetrahydrofolate
(schircks) to a speciﬁc activity of 1765 dpm/nmol, and 100,000g tissue
supernatants (0.12 mg protein) in a ﬁnal volume of 0.1 ml. physiological
assays used to measure  xxxg1480xxx -dependent  xxxg1479xxx  activity
contained 1 mm nadph as reductant. for the measurement of maximal

attainable  xxxg1479xxx  activity, the assays employed a chemical
reducing system consisting of 25 mm dtt and 50 lm  xxxd2300xxx .
argon was passed over reaction components in separate serum vials
(national scientiﬁc) ﬁtted with caps containing rubber seals for at least
30 min while maintaining temperature at 4 c. reaction components,
except for 5-[14c-methyl]methyltetrahydrofolate, were added to serum
vials in a glove box on ice, with tissue supernatants added last, and ﬁtted
with caps. using a hamilton syringe, 5 ll aliquots of 5-[14c-methyl]methyltetrahydrofolate were injected through septa into each vial. reactions
were carried out for 1 h at 37 c. vials were heated for 2 min at 95 c
to stop reactions, and then cooled on ice. after addition of 200 ll deionized water, precipitated reaction components were separated by centrifugation in a micro-centrifuge (16,000g) at room temperature.
supernatants were loaded onto dowex ag1x8-200 (bio-rad) anion
exchange columns and eluted with 2.0 ml of deionized water. eluates
were mixed with 10 ml scintillation cocktail (icn) and radioactivity
was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (beckman coulter).

determination of growth curves
 xxxg1480xxx +/+,  xxxg1480xxx +/gt, and mtrrgt/gt mice representing both sexes of the f2
generation (n = 93) were weighed at two weeks of age, and weekly thereafter until 10 weeks of age. mice were fed a standard 5001-lab chow (labdiet) ad libitum upon weaning.

plasma metabolite measurements
plasma hcy was measured in f2 mice ( xxxg1480xxx +/+, n = 8;  xxxg1480xxx +/gt,
n = 12; mtrrgt/gt, n = 8) and plasma  xxxd2595xxx  was measured in f2 mice
( xxxg1480xxx +/+, n = 6;  xxxg1480xxx +/gt, n = 10; mtrrgt/gt, n = 6) after overnight fasting.
approximately 150 ll of blood was drawn via retroorbital sinus venipuncture into microtainer (becton–dickinson) tubes containing edta
as an anticoagulant. plasma was separated by centrifugation at 4 c at
4000g in a micro-centrifuge for 5 min and stored at 80 c for later analysis. plasma hcy was measured by hplc fractionation coupled to ﬂuorescence detection [29]. plasma  xxxd2595xxx  was measured by hplc with
coulometric electrochemical detection as previously described [27].

determination of tissue  xxxd3156xxx  and  xxxd3157xxx  concentrations
following overnight fasting, liver and brain tissues were removed from
n4f2 mice ( xxxg1480xxx +/+, n = 9; mtrrgt/gt, n = 11) and immediately deproteinized in 0.4  xxxd2595xxx  perchloric acid. in a second experiment, livers were
removed from n8f2 mice ( xxxg1480xxx +/+, n = 3; mtrrgt/gt, n = 4) also backcrossed into the c57bl/6j background. in a third experiment, livers,
hearts, kidneys, and brains were removed from n8f2 mice ( xxxg1480xxx +/+,
n = 4; mtrrgt/gt, n = 4). following deproteinization, homogenates were
clariﬁed by centrifugation at 16,000g for 10 min at 4 c, and supernatants
were ﬂash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c for later analysis.
 xxxd3156xxx  and  xxxd3157xxx  concentrations were measured by ﬂuorescence
detection following hplc fractionation with uv detection [30].

measurement of folate concentrations
analyses of folate forms were carried out in duplicate in liver, heart,
kidney, and brain tissues from three  xxxg1480xxx +/+ and three mtrrgt/gt mice. tissue samples were collected from animals after overnight fast, rinsed in
1 · pbs and immediately stored at 80  c. for folate analyses, tissue
samples were thawed on ice. sections of about 100 mg were cut from each
sample and homogenized manually using a dounce homogenizer in 2 ml
of ice-cold extraction buﬀer containing 50 mm tris–hcl and 50 mm
sodium ascorbate, ph 7.4. tissue homogenates were placed in pre-chilled
microfuge tubes and protein concentrations were determined using the
bradford assay. homogenates were placed in a 95 c water bath for
3 min, then subjected to centrifugation at 14,000g for 5 min at 4 c to

c.l. elmore et al. / molecular genetics and metabolism 91 (2007) 85–97
remove precipitated protein. the supernatant fractions were used to measure reduced folate pools by the ternary complex assay as described elsewhere [31].

dissection and x-gal staining of conceptuses
wild-type c57bl/6j dams were mated to heterozygous f1  xxxg1480xxx +/gt
sires. conceptuses were dissected at embryonic day e9.5 in phosphate buffered saline (pbs). embryos and placentas were ﬁxed in pbs, ph 7.3, containing 0.2% gluteraldehyde, 100 mm mgcl2, and 50 mm egta for 4 h
at 4 c and washed in lacz wash buﬀer consisting of 2 mm mgcl2,
0.01% sodium  xxxd1835xxx , and 0.02% np-40 in pbs. b-galactosidase
expression was determined by staining embryos and placentas with
1 mg/ml 4-chloro-5-bromo-3-indoyl-b-d-galactopyranoside (x-gal; invitrogen), 100 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 100 mm potassium ferricyanide,
in lacz wash buﬀer overnight at 4 c. a leica mz95 dissection microscope with photometrics coolsnap cf camera and open lab 2.2.2 imaging
software program were used to obtain micrographs.

results
generation of  xxxg1480xxx  deﬁcient mice
 xxxg1480xxx -mutant mice were generated using a gene
trapped embryonic stem cell line (xg334) obtained from
baygenomics. southern blotting (fig.  xxxd3227xxx , supplemental material) conﬁrmed insertion of the pgt1lxf vector
between exons 9 and 10 of the  xxxg1480xxx  gene, and the exact
position of the insertion was deduced by dna sequencing (not shown) to be +398 bp downstream of exon 9.
the  xxxg1480xxx  gene, which contains 15 exons, speciﬁes an
n-terminal fmn-binding domain, a linker region that
orients ﬂavin-binding domains for electron transfer,
and a c-terminal fad/nadph-binding domain. exon
9 of  xxxg1480xxx  speciﬁes the end of the linker region and
exon 10 speciﬁes the beginning of the fad/nadph
domain. thus, incorporation of the gene trap generates
a fusion between the fmn and partial-linker domain of
 xxxg1480xxx  and the b-galactosidase/neomycin phosphotransferase gene products. the removal of exons 10–15 eliminates binding determinates for fad and nadph,
disrupting the critical electron transfer elements and
most likely leads to loss of reductase function. we cannot, however, eliminate the possibility that the isolated
fmn domain might retain some limited ability to be
reduced by an alternate electron-donating source.
pcr genotyping (fig. s1b, supplemental material) of
f2 oﬀspring from heterozygous f1 intercross mating
revealed a mendelian distribution of  xxxg1480xxx +/+,  xxxg1480xxx +/gt,
and mtrrgt/gt genotypes, indicating that the gene trap
insertion does not lead to embryonic lethality. given that
 xxxg1479xxx -null embryos implant into the uterus,
but die prior to embryonic day e9.5 [8], the mendelian
distribution suggested that the acceptor splice site of the
cryptic exon containing the gene trap is sometimes
skipped by the rna splicing machinery, thereby generating a mixture of wild-type and gene trap-containing
mrna in mtrrgt/gt mice. if the gene trap were spliced

89

out, wild-type mrna in mtrrgt/gt mice should be
detectable.
analysis of  xxxg1480xxx  mrna and protein expression in  xxxg1480xxx 
deﬁcient mice
reverse transcription-pcr using primers speciﬁc for the
3 0 end of the wild-type  xxxg1480xxx  mrna indicated the presence
of wild-type transcript in liver, heart, kidney, and brain tissues of mtrrgt/gt mice. in order to determine the contribution of wild-type  xxxg1480xxx  mrna in each tissue, relative
quantitative reverse transcription-pcr was performed for
each of the four tissues using primers speciﬁc for the 3 0
end of the wild-type  xxxg1480xxx  mrna (fig. 2a). the gene trap
lowers the expression of the wild-type  xxxg1480xxx  mrna to 20%
in liver, 23% in kidney, and 37% in brain of mtrrgt/gt tissues
as compared to wild-type tissues. in the heart, only 0.8% of
the wild-type  xxxg1480xxx  mrna transcript is detectable in mice
homozygous for the gene trap. in addition to detecting
changes in wild-type  xxxg1480xxx  mrna expression levels, the
total amount of  xxxg1480xxx  mrna transcript (wild-type form
plus gene trapped form) was measured using primers
speciﬁc for the 5 0 end of the  xxxg1480xxx  mrnas, which is shared

fig. 2. relative quantitative reverse transcription-pcrs were carried out
to determine (a) the fold-diﬀerence between wild-type  xxxg1480xxx  mrna
present in  xxxg1480xxx +/+ and mtrrgt/gt mice (wild-type  xxxg1480xxx  mrna only), or (b)
the fold-diﬀerence of total  xxxg1480xxx  mrna present in  xxxg1480xxx +/+ and mtrrgt/gt
mice (wild-type form plus gene trapped form). ct measurements were
carried out in triplicate after reverse transcription of rna puriﬁed from
liver, heart, kidney, and brain tissues of both  xxxg1480xxx +/+ mice (2 males and 2
females) and mtrrgt/gt mice (2 males and 2 females). no diﬀerences were
detected based on gender. ct values were determined by monitoring
sybr green ﬂuorescence in real time. pcr products were evaluated for
homogeneity using dissociation analysis and post-pcr gel electrophoresis.
values are the mean fold-changes between mtrrgt/gt animals versus  xxxg1480xxx +/+
reference animals. asterisks indicate a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence

by both wild-type and gene trapped mrnas (fig. 2b). the
total level of  xxxg1480xxx  mrna transcript in  xxxg1480xxx +/+ and
mtrrgt/gt animals was not statistically diﬀerent in heart,
liver, or kidney. however, total  xxxg1480xxx  mrna levels were
increased 3-fold in brain tissues of gene trapped animals
as compared to wild-type animals, an indication that some
cell types may compensate for decreased levels of  xxxg1480xxx 
expression by upregulating  xxxg1480xxx  transcriptionally.
in order to determine if changes in wild-type  xxxg1480xxx 
mrna levels correlated with the amount of  xxxg1480xxx  protein, western blotting was performed with 100,000g supernatants of homogenates from  xxxg1480xxx +/+ and mtrrgt/gt liver,
heart, kidney, and brain tissues (fig. 3). a qualitative
decrease in  xxxg1480xxx  was detected in all four tissues, in general agreement with decreases in mrna expression seen in
fig. 2.  xxxg1480xxx  was estimated to be present at low pg quantities on blots. thus, background variability made quantiﬁcation of protein levels by image analysis unreliable. a
band consistent with the 198.6 kda fusion protein (exons
1–9 of  xxxg1480xxx  and b-galactosidase/neomycin phosphotransferase gene products) was visualized in mtrrgt/gt tissues under some conditions (not shown).
 xxxg1480xxx  speciﬁc activity in  xxxg1480xxx  deﬁcient mice
to assess the functional consequences of lowered
mrna and protein expression in mtrrgt/gt mice, mtrrdependent reactivation of  xxxg1479xxx  was
determined in liver, heart, kidney, and brain tissue homogenates by monitoring transfer of a radiolabeled methyl
group from [14c]methyltetrahydrofolate to  xxxd2595xxx 
(table 1). for these assays, the endogenous  xxxg1480xxx  in
the tissue is required for sustained activity of  xxxd2595xxx 
synthase, and no chemical reducing system is present. as
a control,  xxxg1479xxx  speciﬁc activity was also
measured using a chemical reducing system (dtt and

 xxxd2300xxx ), in which the requirement for  xxxg1480xxx 
is eliminated. this assay, which requires no accessory protein, is an accurate measure of the amount of active  xxxg1479xxx  in the tissue being examined, and would
reveal any changes in  xxxg1479xxx  expression and
holoenzyme formation that might result from decreased
levels of  xxxg1480xxx . as indicated in table 1, levels of active
ms determined using the chemical reducing system did
not vary signiﬁcantly between  xxxg1480xxx +/+ and mtrrgt/gt mice
in any tissue, although there was some variation from
one animal to another.  xxxg1480xxx -dependent  xxxg1479xxx  assay values were expressed as a percentage of the
activity measured using the chemical reducing system in
that mouse tissue.  xxxg1480xxx -dependent  xxxg1479xxx 
speciﬁc activities were signiﬁcantly decreased in all tissues
of mtrrgt/gt mice as compared to wild-type controls.
the reader will note that the  xxxg1480xxx -dependent speciﬁc
activities measured using the physiological reducing system
were consistently lower than those measured using the
chemical reducing system. in order to measure the speciﬁc
activities listed in table 1, crude tissue homogenates were
diluted to a single protein concentration attainable for all
tissue types (3.0 mg/ml) in homogenization buﬀer and further diluted 2.5-fold into the assay mixture. we have conducted a series of experiments in which we measured the
physiological activity of wild-type liver homogenates prepared with varying amounts of homogenization buﬀer
(table s1 in supplementary material), and found that the
speciﬁc activities measured using the  xxxg1480xxx -dependent
 xxxg1479xxx  assay decrease with increasing dilution, while those measured using the chemical reducing system do not change. this observation may indicate that a
complex is formed between  xxxg1480xxx  and  xxxg1479xxx , and that this complex dissociates when tissue
extracts are diluted. consequently, for the experiments
shown in table 1, homogenates were prepared at the same
concentration of total protein (3.0 mg protein/ml, 0.12 mg
protein/assay). for this reason, we do not interpret the
results in table 1 as indicating that the concentration of
 xxxg1480xxx  is necessarily limiting for the activity of  xxxd2595xxx 
synthase in wild-type mice, in vivo.
growth curves for male and female  xxxg1480xxx  deﬁcient mice

fig. 3. western blotting of 100,000g supernatants of liver (l), heart (h),
kidney (k), and brain (b) tissue homogenates from  xxxg1480xxx +/+ and mtrrgt/gt
female mice was performed to assess the impact of the gene trap insertion
on protein levels. the response to polyclonal antibody speciﬁc for  xxxg1480xxx 
protein was assessed (top panel). mouse  xxxg1480xxx  migrates at the correct
molecular mass of 77.6 kda. the puriﬁed recombinant human  xxxd2595xxx 
synthase reductase with n-terminal hexahistidine tag ( xxxg1480xxx  6 · his)
migrates at 81.1 kda. the blot was stripped and re-probed with antibody
speciﬁc for the 42.1 kda mouse b-actin protein (lower panel), in order to
conﬁrm equal protein loading, as shown in the bottom panel.

disrupted  xxxd2595xxx  biosynthesis leading to limited
availability of  xxxd2595xxx  might be expected to impair
growth in rodents even when they are fed a methioninereplete diet [32]. we monitored the weights of  xxxg1480xxx +/+,
 xxxg1480xxx +/gt, and mtrrgt/gt mice of both sexes beginning at 2
weeks of age and weekly thereafter until mice reached 10
weeks of age (fig. 4). males, but not females, of the
mtrrgt/gt genotype showed reduced weight gain. mtrrgt/gt
male mice were 10% smaller than male  xxxg1480xxx +/+ littermates,
with mtrrgt/gt males averaging only 25.1 g compared to
28.0 g for wild-type males at week 10. the trend was evident at the ﬁrst weighing, and became statistically signiﬁcant by 7 weeks of age. the average weight of  xxxg1480xxx +/gt

plasma total homocyst(e)ine and  xxxd2595xxx  concentrations
in contrast to the apparently mild morphological phenotype observed in mtrrgt/gt mice, biochemical indicators
demonstrated a signiﬁcantly altered metabolic phenotype
(table 2). mice homozygous for the mtrrgt allele had
plasma total hcy concentrations of 18.4 ± 5.5 lm
(mean ± sd), heterozygotes had values of 5.5 ± 1.8 lm,
and  xxxg1480xxx +/+animals had values of 4.6 ± 0.8 lm. we
also detected a 32% decrease in plasma  xxxd2595xxx  in
mtrrgt/gt mice (values were 40.4 ± 6.6 mm for mtrrgt/gt,
48.9 ± 10.5 lm for  xxxg1480xxx +/gt, and 59.4 ± 7.4 for  xxxg1480xxx +/+

 xxxg1475xxx  ( xxxg1475xxx )-null mice
have hyperhomocyst(e)inemia, along with elevated  xxxd3157xxx  and depressed  xxxd3156xxx  concentrations in liver and
brain tissues [26]. hyperhomocyst(e)inemia in mtrrgt/gt
mice is comparable to that in  xxxg1475xxx / mice (table 2), suggesting that a similar result might also be expected for  xxxd3156xxx  and  xxxd3157xxx  levels in  xxxg1480xxx -gene trapped mice. the
levels of  xxxd3156xxx  and  xxxd3157xxx  measured in liver, kidney,
heart, and brain tissues of wild-type and mtrrgt/gt mice
are shown in table 3. in heart tissue, the expected trend
is seen, with higher levels of  xxxd3157xxx  in the mtrrgt/gt mice
than in the wild-type mice, and lower  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx 
ratios. however,  xxxd3156xxx  and  xxxd3157xxx  levels showed an
unexpected trend in livers of mtrrgt/gt mice, with  xxxd3156xxx 
levels signiﬁcantly higher in mtrrgt/gt liver than in wildtype, and  xxxd3157xxx  concentrations lower in mtrrgt/gt mice.
these eﬀects were measured in mice backcrossed four generations into the c57bl/6j background, and conﬁrmed in

analyses of  xxxg1480xxx  expression in e9.5 embryos
polymorphisms in the human  xxxg1479xxx 
reductase gene have been found to correlate with an
increased risk of neural tube defects [33–37]. if  xxxg1480xxx  is
functionally important for proper neural tube closure in
mice,  xxxg1480xxx  expression would be expected in or around
the neural tube between days e8.5 to e10.5 [38]. using bgalactosidase activity driven from the  xxxg1480xxx  gene trap allele
in e9.5  xxxg1480xxx +/gt embryos as a marker for  xxxg1480xxx  expression,
we detected ubiquitous  xxxg1480xxx  expression throughout the
entire embryo (fig. 5). intense b-galactosidase expression
was observed in the optic eminence, forebrain (telencephalon and diencephalon), midbrain, the 2nd and 4th rhombomeres of the hindbrain, and the neural tube, consistent with
a role for  xxxg1480xxx  in brain and neural tube development. histological sectioning of these embryos also revealed b-galactosidase staining within the notochord (data not shown). a
high level of  xxxg1480xxx  expression was also detected within the
ﬁrst brachial arch, splanchnic mesoderm, hindgut, foregut,
and the labyrinth layer of the placenta.
discussion
in this report, we have generated and characterized a
mouse model for  xxxg1480xxx  deﬁciency.
in mtrrgt/gt mice, the gene trap causes a hypomorphic
expression pattern of wild-type  xxxg1480xxx  mrna that varies
by tissue, but that is similar between males and females
of the same genotype. wild-type  xxxg1480xxx  mrna levels in
mtrrgt/gt mice varied between 37% and <1% of those of
wild-type mice, indicating tissue-speciﬁc skipping of the
gene trap cassette. western blot analyses of liver, heart,
kidney, and brain tissues prepared from  xxxg1480xxx +/+ and
mtrrgt/gt mice show decreases in  xxxg1480xxx  protein in all tissues analyzed (see fig. 3). the ability of endogenous
 xxxg1480xxx  to activate endogenous  xxxg1479xxx  was
also measured. these experiments demonstrated a signiﬁcant genotype-dependent decrease in  xxxg1479xxx 
activity in all tissues examined. as might be expected from
the relative quantitative reverse transcription-pcr measurements, the decrease in activity was most pronounced
in heart tissue. male mtrrgt/gt mice were 10% smaller by
week 10 after birth than their heterozygous and wild-type
littermates. wild-type male mice show an increased rate
of growth compared to females as they approach adulthood. therefore, disruption of  xxxd2595xxx  biosynthesis,
which would lead to limited availability of  xxxd2595xxx ,
might be expected to impair growth in mice, as demonstrated by a  xxxd1771xxx   xxxd3520xxx -deﬁcient rat model [32].
disruption of the  xxxg1480xxx  gene in embryonic stem cells
was carried out at baygenomics using gene trapping
methodology, as pioneered by skarnes and colleagues
[39]. gene trapping has provided thousands of new
genetic models, the majority of which emulate their targeted deletional mutant counterparts. however, a substantial number of gene trap models produce some level

of wild-type mrna in homozygotes carrying the gene
trap [40–42]. nonetheless, hypomorphic models may
prove useful, especially if targeted deletion of a gene
causes embryonic lethality. homozygous deletion of the
 xxxg1479xxx  gene leads to embryonic lethality in
mice, but the phenotype of heterozygous animals is quite
mild [8]. because  xxxg1480xxx  is
believed to be required for reactivation of  xxxg1479xxx , and because the phenotype of  xxxg1480xxx  patients with
low  xxxg1480xxx  levels is so severe, we
hypothesize that complete suppression of  xxxg1480xxx  activity likely leads to embryonic lethality
as well. a deletional model for the  xxxg1480xxx  gene has been
generated in one of our laboratories. heterozygous f1
intercross matings have thus far not resulted in any animals that are homozygous for the deletion (r. gravel,
unpublished results).
the mtrrgt/gt animals show signiﬁcant hyperhomocyst(e)inemia and hypomethionemia, but surprisingly their
intracellular  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratios range from high
to slightly below normal. the  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratio is
mildly decreased in heart, where the severest reduction
of  xxxg1480xxx  expression and activity is seen, and is maintained at approximately normal levels in kidney and
brain. in liver, the  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratio is actually
signiﬁcantly higher than that in wild-type littermates
(table 3).
in this respect,  xxxg1480xxx  deﬁciency produces a very diﬀerent
proﬁle from the well-characterized mouse model for  xxxg1475xxx 
deﬁciency (table 2). in the  xxxg1475xxx / mouse,  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratios in liver are about 6-fold lower than in the wildtype controls, while in brain they are about 5-fold lower
[26]. the distinction between hyperhomocyst(e)inemia produced by  xxxg1480xxx  and/or  xxxg1479xxx  deﬁciency
and that produced by  xxxg1475xxx  deﬁciency has not been
noted before. however, an examination of the literature
provides hints that the very diﬀerent  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx 
ratios seen at roughly equivalent levels of hyperhomocyst(e)inemia and hypomethionemia may be common to
 xxxg1479xxx  deﬁciency regardless of the method
by which it is induced.
as shown in table 2, mice heterozygous for the mtr
deletion (mtr+/), with reduced expression of  xxxd2595xxx 
synthase, have  xxxd3156xxx  levels in liver that are higher than
those in wild-type littermates are by 25%. additionally,
their  xxxd3157xxx  levels were 90% of those in wild-type animals, leading to an  xxxd3156xxx : xxxd3157xxx  ratio that was
1.5· higher than in wild-type littermates [43]. similarly,
in rats fed a  xxxd1771xxx   xxxd3520xxx -deﬁcient diet for 5 weeks, which
also leads to diminished  xxxg1479xxx  activity,
hepatic  xxxd3156xxx  levels increased 41%, and the  xxxd3156xxx /
 xxxd3157xxx  ratio increased from 2.5 to 2.7, even as plasma
homocyst(e)ine increased by 2.4-fold [44]. the similar
proﬁles seen when  xxxg1479xxx  levels are reduced
by genetic means or by  xxxd1771xxx   xxxd3520xxx  deﬁciency suggest that
a compensatory mechanisms exist to spare intracellular
 xxxd3156xxx  levels whenever  xxxg1479xxx  activity is

c.l. elmore et al. / molecular genetics and metabolism 91 (2007) 85–97

reduced, regardless of the mechanism by which decreased
activity is induced.
the mechanisms by which mice with a functional  xxxg1479xxx  deﬁciency maintain their cellular  xxxd3156xxx /
 xxxd3157xxx  ratios in the face of their hyperhomocyst(e)inemia
and hypomethioninemia remain unclear. in tissues where
betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase is expressed, such
as liver and to a lesser extent kidney, this enzyme may compensate for the reduced level of  xxxg1480xxx  and help to maintain the  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratio in these tissues. glycine-nmethyl transferase ( xxxg928xxx ) may also play an important
role in this compensation, in those tissues where it is
expressed.  xxxg928xxx  catalyzes the  xxxd3156xxx -dependent methylation of glycine to produce sarcosine and  xxxd3157xxx . this
methylation is thought to provide a means of regulating
the level of  xxxd3156xxx  in cells, since the product sarcosine
is rapidly reoxidized to glycine in mitochondria. conﬁrming this role for  xxxg928xxx , mice completely lacking  xxxg928xxx 
due to gene deletion exhibit a 35-fold increase in  xxxd3156xxx , with a 3-fold decrease in  xxxd3157xxx  [45]. tissues with
high levels of  xxxg928xxx , such as liver or kidney [46], typically
exhibit lower ratios of  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  than do tissues
like brain with very low levels of  xxxg928xxx  activity [47]. as
shown in table 3, the lowest  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratios in
wild-type mice are found in liver, while those in kidney
and brain are higher, and those in heart the highest of
all.  xxxg928xxx  activity is allosterically inhibited by methyltetrahydrofolate. in the liver of the  xxxg1475xxx / mouse, with
only 4% of the methyltetrahydrofolate found in the wildtype littermates [26]  xxxg928xxx  activity should be nearly maximal. in contrast, when hyperhomocyst(e)inemia is induced
by  xxxg1479xxx  deﬁciency, methyltetrahydrofolate
levels in tissues will be normal to high, and  xxxg928xxx  activity
would be expected to be strongly inhibited, thus preserving
the  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratio.
while these arguments would explain the observation of
normal  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratios in mice with a functional
 xxxg1479xxx  deﬁciency, it would not explain the
elevated levels we observe in liver, unless methyl trapping
leads to more inhibition of liver  xxxg928xxx  than in the wildtype littermates. inspection of table 4 reveals that the
absolute concentrations of methyltetrahydrofolate are
higher in liver than in other tissues, in both wild-type and
mthfrgt/gt mice.  xxxg928xxx  speciﬁc activity is normally highest
in liver, so the sparing eﬀect may be greatest in this tissue if
it is indeed due to inhibition of  xxxg928xxx  activity. the concentration of methyltetrahydrofolate observed in the livers
of mtrrgt/gt mice is 142% of that in wild-type littermates.
however, other factors may also contribute to the observed
increase in the  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratio in the livers of our
gene trapped mice.
regardless of its origin, the very diﬀerent ratios of  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  in the various genetic mouse models for
hyperhomocyst(e)inemia have potentially important medical implications. the diﬀerent folate distributions in the
mtrrgt/gt and the  xxxg1475xxx / mice may be useful in understanding how the distribution rather than the amount of

95

folate aﬀects various pathologies associated with folate
deﬁciency. the dramatic eﬀect of maternal dietary supplementation with  xxxd2146xxx  in protecting against neural tube
defects in the fetus has been known for some time [48,49].
what is not yet known is why neural crest cells are particularly vulnerable to folate deﬁciency, or what forms of
folate are protective. do neural tube defects arise because
of apoptosis of neural crest cells due to an insuﬃcient supply of methylenetetrahydrofolate, or because of pathologies arising from altered  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratios [50]? if
the incidence of neural tube defects in the progeny of the
 xxxg1475xxx / mouse were found to be diﬀerent from that in
the progeny of the mtrrgt/gt mouse, important insights into
the role of folate in preventing neural tube defects would be
obtained.
similarly, comparison of hyperhomocyst(e)inemic
mouse models may be useful in understanding pathologies
associated with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine. homocyst(e)ine has emerged as a signiﬁcant risk factor for adverse
cardiovascular events, including heart disease and stroke
[51–55]. it is interesting to note that  xxxg1480xxx  function in
the heart is particularly impacted in mtrrgt/gt mice. future
study of heart tissues may reveal subtle phenotypic diﬀerences and clarify the eﬀects of decreased  xxxg1480xxx  function
and hyperhomocyst(e)inemia in the hearts of these mice.
detailed studies of embryonic abnormalities induced by
 xxxg1480xxx  deﬁciency and of cardiac function in the adult
mtrrgt/gt mouse are currently underway in the rozen and
gravel laboratories. not all people with elevated plasma
homocyst(e)ine may be equally at risk for the development
of cardiovascular disease. to date, there are four genetic
mouse models with hyperhomocyst(e)inemia, the three
mentioned above and a model with a disruption in cystathionine-b-synthase (cbs), which results in the inability to
convert homocysteine to cysteine [56]. the metabolite levels in these four mouse models are summarized in table
2. while all of these models cause hyperhomocyst(e)inemia,
in two of these mouse models (cbs and  xxxg1475xxx ), the  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratios are lower in the mutant animals than
in wild-type, while in the remaining two models (mtr and
 xxxg1480xxx ), the  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  values are the same or higher
in the mutant animals than in wild-type. careful studies of
the incidence of cardiovascular pathology in each of these
models may allow us to determine whether it is the low
intracellular  xxxd3156xxx : xxxd3157xxx  ratio that is associated with
cardiovascular disease or the high level of total homocysteine in the blood.
