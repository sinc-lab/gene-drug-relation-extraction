the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of polymorphisms in  xxxg656xxx  ( xxxg656xxx ) and cytochrome
p450 (cyp) 2d6 genes on delta eeg power response to aripiprazole in healthy male volunteers. seventeen volunteers were
recruited according to the  xxxg656xxx  taq1a genotype, and separated into the following groups: homozygous wild-type (a2/a2,
n ¼ 7), heterozygous (a2/a1, n ¼ 5) and homozygous variant-type (a1/a1, n ¼ 5) groups. after enrollment in this study,
they were genotyped for cyp2d6. the volunteers received single 10 mg oral doses of aripiprazole, in accordance with an
open-label parallel group study design. plasma levels of aripiprazole and its metabolite were determined and eegs were
obtained simultaneously. the pharmacodynamic parameter was absolute delta power in the cz channel. the changes of delta
power were not different according to  xxxg656xxx  taq1a genotypes. as to the cyp2d6 allele, the subjects had the following
cyp2d6 genotypes: 10/10 (n ¼ 4), 1/10 (n ¼ 5), 1/5 (n ¼ 2), 1/1 (n ¼ 3), 2/41 (n ¼ 1), 2/2 (n ¼ 1), 2n/10
(n ¼ 1). subjects exhibiting the 1/5 and 1/10 genotypes showed a trend toward high area under the plasma aripiprazole
concentration-time curve (auc), which was linearly related to area under the eeg response-time curve (auec). our results
demonstrate a need for further evaluation of the cyp2d6 genotypic effect on the pharmacodynamics of aripiprazole.

introduction
although clinical response to medication tends to vary
broadly in the patients with schizophrenia, this
variability currently remains poorly understood. trials
and errors of treatment with antipsychotic drugs are
frequently conducted in order to formulate optimal
medication regimens.

in recent years, some investigators have reported a
relation between genetic variations and drug responses
in pharmacotherapy of mental disorders. genetic
variations in  xxxg656xxx  ( xxxg656xxx ), the
principal target of antipsychotic drugs, have been
studied extensively. pharmacogenetic research into
 xxxg656xxx  has classically focused on the taq1a polymorphism, which yields two alleles (the a1 and a2
allele). the minor allele or the a1 allele has been
associated with lower  xxxg656xxx  density values (noble
et al., 1991; thompson et al., 1997; pohjalainen et al.,
1998; jonsson et al., 1999). the patients with
schizophrenia with the a1 allele tended to exhibit
superior therapeutic responses to antipsychotic drugs,

and also manifested more adverse effects (mihara
et al., 2000; suzuki et al., 2000; mihara et al., 2001;
schafer et al., 2001; suzuki et al., 2001).
pharmacogenetic research has also underlined the
importance of metabolic enzymes. the majority of
antipsychotic drugs are metabolized to a significant
extent by cytochrome p450 (cyp) enzymes (dahl,
2002). depending on the polymorphisms that affect
the activities of cyp enzymes, the patients with
schizophrenia may exhibit either a toxic accumulation
or a rapid elimination of antipsychotic drugs. among
the cyp enzymes, the polymorphic cyp2d6 has been
probably the most extensively studied with regard to
its impact on the metabolism of antipsychotic drugs
(dahl, 2002). the cyp2d6 polymorphism has been
reported to influence the steady-state concentration of
several antipsychotic drugs, including perphenazine,
 xxxd3568xxx , risperidone and haloperidol (dahl
et al., 1989; von bahr et al., 1991; llerena et al., 1992;
huang et al., 1993; linnet and wiborg, 1996; jaanson
et al., 2002). poorer metabolizers for cyp2d6 were
significantly more prone to drug-induced abnormal
movements and tardive dyskinesia during treatment
with antipsychotic drugs (kapitany et al., 1998;
ellingrod et al., 2000).
until now, most studies have evaluated the impacts
of genetic variation on the pharmacodynamics of
antipsychotic drugs, using clinical scales. in spite of
the development of sophisticated clinical scales and
the achievement of a relatively high degree of interrater reliability, objective and quantifiable biological
measures and predictors of response to treatment still
remain to be established. in recent years, brainimaging techniques, including quantitative electroencephalography (qeeg), positron emission tomography (pet), single photon emission computed
tomography (spect) and magnetic resonance imaging (mri), have bridged this gap to some extent,
serving as an intermediate phenotype in pharmacogenetic research. compared with other brain imaging
techniques, qeeg exhibits superior time resolution
and is widely used to study the effects of psychotropic
drugs, such that the class of the drugs can be inferred
from the qeeg profile (saletu et al., 2002).
aripiprazole has been the focus of increasing
clinical attention due to its unique receptor profile as a
dopamine partial agonist, and is expected to prove
useful in the treatment of schizophrenia with less
adverse effects than have been associated with other
agents (grunder et al., 2003). aripiprazole has a high
affinity for  xxxg656xxx , and is eliminated via the actions of
cyp2d6 and cyp3a4. this raises the possibility that
genetic variations of  xxxg656xxx  and cyp2d6 might exert

et al.

some influence on the pharmacodynamics of aripiprazole. however, no pharmacogenetic studies have
yet been conducted concerning aripiprazole pharmacodynamics from standpoints of  xxxg656xxx  and cyp2d6
polymorphisms. therefore, this study was conducted
in order to determine whether or not polymorphisms
of  xxxg656xxx  taq1a and cyp2d6 might affect the
pharmacodynamics of aripiprazole. we used absolute
delta power, which exhibited a significant change in
the patients with schizophrenia on aripiprazole, as a
pharmacodynamic parameter (canive et al., 1998).
method
subjects
seventeen right-handed healthy male volunteers
participated in this study after each had signed an
informed consent. the study protocol of this study was
approved by the institutional review board of seoul
national university hospital, seoul, korea. the
volunteers were from 184 subjects whose genetic
information was available prior to the present study,
and were recruited according to their  xxxg656xxx  taq1a
genotypes. they were then divided into the following
groups; the homozygous wild type (a2/a2, n ¼ 7),
heterozygous (a2/a1, n ¼ 5), and homozygous variant-type (a1/a1, n ¼ 5) groups. after enrollment in
this study, all subjects were genotyped for cyp2d6.
the average age (sd) of the subjects was 24.4
(1.3; age range, 23–28 years) and the average body
weight and height of the subjects were 67.7 (8.0) kg
and 176.1 (4.8) cm, respectively. all of the subjects
in the study had been completely drug-free for at least
1 month, had not used alcohol and/or caffeine for at
least 3 days prior to enrollment in the study, and had no
history of medical or psychiatric disease.
study design
the study was conducted according to an open-label
parallel group study design. after fasting overnight for
at least 8 h, the subjects received single 10 mg oral
doses of aripiprazole, with 240 ml water, at 9 a.m.
considering the pharmacokinetic profile of aripiprazole from previous studies, blood samples for the
measurement of aripiprazole and its metabolite (opc14857) were obtained just before and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9,
12, 24, 48, and 72 h after the administration of
aripiprazole. eeg was measured simultaneously with
the acquisition of the blood sample. for 24 h, the
measurements were conducted in the state of
admission and subsequent measurements were taken

in the outpatient unit of the clinical trial center,
seoul national university hospital.
 xxxg656xxx  taq1a genotyping
genomic dna was extracted from the peripheral
whole blood of each of the subjects with a qiagen
dna extraction kit (qiagen, hilden, germany),
operated in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions. the presence of the a1 and a2 allele
was evaluated via pcr and single base extension,
using snapshot analysis. the following primers were
used for pcr amplification: 50 -gctggccaagttgtctaaat30 (forward) and 50 -tggagctgtgaactggact-30 (reverse).
for snapshot analysis, the pcr products were
purified using exonuclease i and shrimp alkaline
phosphatase (usb, cleveland, ohio, usa) and then
mixed with amplitaq dna polymerase, four fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides, each of the
primers for single base extension, and the reaction
buffer of an abi prism1 snapshottm multiplex kit
(applied biosystems), in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocols. the primer used for single base
extension was 50 -cacagccatcctcaaagtgctggtc-30 for
taq1a polymorphism. this primer was extended
over 25 cycles of 968c for 10 sec, 508c for 5 sec, and
608c for 30 sec. the amplicons were then analyzed
using an abi prism1 3700 automated sequencer
(applied biosystems). dna sequences proximal to
the polymorphic sites were verified via direct
sequencing.
cyp2d6 genotyping
the genbank accession number used in this study as a
reference sequence for the cyp2d6 gene was
m33388, but the nucleotide numbering followed the
guidelines of the cyp allele nomenclature committee
homepage, with the a of the translational start codon
being defined as þ 1. cyp2d6 genotyping was
conducted for the 2, 5, 10, 17, and 41 alleles,
and for the duplication of the cyp2d6 gene. in order
to selectively detect the 2, 17, and 41 alleles,
we proceeded on the basis of recent reports (furman
et al., 2004; raimundo et al., 2004). the dna
near polymorphic sites, 1584c>g, 1023c>t,
2988g>a, was amplified via nested polymerase
chain reactions (pcr), followed by automated
sequencing analysis. the cyp2d610 allele
(188c>t) was detected via two-step pcr analysis
in accordance with the method developed by
johansson et al. (1994). the cyp2d65 allele (gene
deletion) and gene duplication were detected via long

pcr, in accordance with the methods described by
steen et al. (1995) and lundqvist et al. (1999),
respectively. alleles containing none of the above
described alleles were uniformly classified as
cyp2d61.

quantitative eeg measurement
eeg activities were collected using the neuroscan
eeg synamp and scan version 4.3 (neurosoft, usa)
in an electrically shielded and soundproofed experimental room in the clinical trial center, seoul
national university hospital. for the eeg recordings,
15 silver chloride electrodes were positioned according to the international 10–20 system (fp1, fp2, f3,
f4, fz, t3, t4, c3, c4, cz, p3, p4, pz, o1, o2). all of
these electrodes were fixed to the scalp using
collodion, and impedance was maintained at below
5 kv. these were referred to linked electrodes
positioned on the left and right mastoid process.
the eeg was recorded continuously using a 0.05–
100 hz analog bandpass filter at sampling rate of
1000 hz and stored for later analysis. eyeball movements and blinks were monitored via the electrooculogram.
all subjects sat in a comfortable armchair in a semidarkened room and remained awake during the eeg
recording. the eeg was measured for 3 min per
session. the subjects were instructed to remain awake
until 12 h elapsed after the administration of
aripiprazole, even during the inter-recording periods.
they were also constantly monitored so that they did
not doze off. the subjects had a normal night’s rest
12 h after the administration of aripiprazole, and were
instructed to wake up 1 h prior to the recording.
for the subsequent eeg signal processing, artifactfree epochs were selected from each of the recordings.
the epoch selection was conducted visually, and eeg
segments containing artifacts (muscle activity, ocular
artifacts and movement potentials) or showing
drowsiness were rejected. the two primary criteria
for recognizing drowsiness were (1) the dissolution
and fragmentation of occipital alpha rhythm with a
shift to the anterior regions and (2) an enhanced
frequency variation with a polyrhythmic disintegration of resting eeg into slower and faster
components (bente, 1979; streitberg et al., 1987).
the selected individual eeg epochs were then
subjected to signal processing, consisting of fast
fourier transformation and spectral analysis. absolute
power in the delta (0.5–4 hz) frequency band was
obtained via spectral analysis.

determination of aripiprazole and opc-14857
plasma levels
plasma concentrations of aripiprazole and its metabolite
opc-14857 were determined via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (lc-ms/ms). in brief,
both aripiprazole and opc-14857, together with their
internal standard (opc-14714), were extracted from the
plasma, via liquid–liquid extractions with diethylether.
after centrifugation, the organic phase was evaporated to
dryness at ambient temperature in a speed-vac (savant,
holbrook, ny). the residue was then reconstituted in
0.2 ml of a mobile phase, and 20 ml of this was
analyzed using an api 3000 lc-ms/ms system (sciex
division of mds inc., toronto, canada), which had been
equipped with an agilent 1100 series hplc system
(agilent, wilmington, de). the compounds were then
chromatographically separated using a luna cn column
(2.0  100 mm, 3 mm; phenomenex, torrance, ca),
with water and acetonitrile (3/7, v/v) containing 0.1%
 xxxd2154xxx  mobile phase, at a 0.3 ml/min flow rate. the
ms/ms system was operated using an electrospray in
positive ionization mode. in order to determine levels of
aripiprazole, opc-14857, and opc-14714, the following precursor-to-product ion reactions were monitored:
m/z 448.1 ! 285.2, 446.0 ! 285.2, and 458.2 ! 295.1,
respectively. the coefficient of variation of the intra- and
inter-day assays was <10.3%, with accuracy ranging
from 97.0 to 108.5%. the lower limit of quantification
for both aripiprazole and opc-14857 was 0.1 ng/ml.
pharmacokinetic analysis
pharmacokinetic parameters of aripiprazole and opc14857 (cmax, tmax, auc, t1/2, and cl/f) were

aripiprazole and with random effects for subject. nonparametric tests were conducted in order to evaluate
the group effect on the eeg changes at each time
point. linear regression was employed in the analysis
of the relationship between the area under the plasma
concentration-time curve (auc) and auec.

results
aripiprazole was rapidly absorbed and slowly
eliminated. the average time required to achieve
peak plasma concentration was 3.2 h, and the average
elimination half-life was 56.6 h. the elimination halflife of active moiety (aripiprazole plus opc-14857)
was longer than that of aripiprazole (table 1). because
the plasma concentrations of opc-14857 were much
lower than those of aripiprazole, we did not include the
plasma concentrations of opc-14857 in pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic analysis.
the absolute power of the delta frequency
band in the cz and fz channels were influenced
significantly by the administration of aripiprazole (cz: df ¼ 10,160, f ¼ 3.743; p < 0.001;
fz: df ¼ 10,160, f ¼ 2.673; p ¼ 0.005; figure 1).
although ocular artifacts were extracted via signal
processing including visual selection of artifactfree epoch and bandpass filter, we could not
completely rule out a possibility that the eeg
signal from fz channel was contaminated by
eyeball movement. therefore we analyzed the
eeg signal from cz channel, and calculated
the eeg responses, which were defined via the
following equation (1):

absolute delta power was observed to increase steeply
until the 6th hour after the administration of
aripiprazole and gradually decreased thereafter
(figure 2). in magnetoencephalographic study, aripiprazole was shown to decrease delta activity in the
patients with schizophrenia after 8 weeks of treatment
with aripiprazole (canive et al., 1998). our findings in
healthy volunteers differed from the findings of the
patient study conducted by canive et al. (1998). this
discrepancy might be attributable to differences in the
subjects, the duration of aripiprazole administration
and the dose of aripiprazole between the two studies.
the findings of an in vitro study indicated that partial
agonists behaved like antagonists under lower receptor
density conditions, and like agonists under higher
receptor density conditions (mcdonald et al., 2003).
in vivo receptor imaging studies reported increased
density of striatal  xxxg656xxx  in the patients with
schizophrenia comparing with healthy subjects (wong

viewpoint, the dopamine partial agonism, manifested

by aripiprazole, might also exert some effects on the
discrepancy.
we anticipated that the pharmacodynamics of
aripiprazole, which exhibits a high affinity for
 xxxg656xxx , would differ according to the  xxxg656xxx  taq1a
genotypes. however, we could not observe that the
 xxxg656xxx  taq1a genotypes had an effect on delta power
changes after the administration of aripiprazole. one
possible explanation for this result is that the
difference of  xxxg656xxx  density is insufficient to affect

delta power change in healthy subjects, in whom an
unknown mechanism may be operant, which compensates for the effects generated by the  xxxg656xxx  taq1a
genotypes. the other explanation is that there might be
interaction between the  xxxg656xxx  genotypes and
cyp2d6 genotypes. these explanations are, however,
limited, as the sample size was small, and patients with
schizophrenia were not included in the present study.
there is a possibility that cyp2d6 genotypes affect
the auc of aripiprazole. the aucs in 30 min and 1 h
after the administration of aripiprazole were significantly different according to the cyp2d6 genotype,
and subjects with the 1/5 genotype exhibited
generally higher auc values after the administration
of aripiprazole than did subjects with other genotypes
(table 4, figure 4). this result is consistent with the
findings of previous studies regarding the 5 allele,
which features a gene deletion mutation abolishing
enzyme expression. someya et al. (1999) reported that
subjects with the 5 allele manifested higher plasma
concentrations of haloperidol than did subjects with
the 1/1, 1/10, and 10/10 genotype. by contrast,
kubo et al. (2005) reported that the auc values for
aripiprazole tended to be lower in the 1/5 group than
in the 1/10 and 10/10 group. the study by kubo
et al. (2005) differs from the present study, in that the
auc from 0 to 336 h after the administration of 3 mg
aripiprazole was used to compare pharmacokinetic
profiles between cyp2d6 genotypes, and in that the
subjects were japanese. such differences between the
two studies might lead to conflicting results, which
requires further pharmacogenetic study.
because of small sample size, we could not
analyze 1/10 group and 10/10 group separately.
however, table 4 and figure 4 showed that subjects
with the 1/10 genotype exhibited a trend toward
higher auc values after the administration of
aripiprazole. the 10 allele, which induces reduction
of enzyme affinity for the substrate, has been
associated with the high plasma levels and auc
values after the administration of several psychoactive
drugs, including haloperidol, nortriptyline, paroxetine
and aripiprazole (yoon et al., 2000; dalen et al., 2003;
someya et al., 2003; kubo et al., 2005). our findings
are in accordance with the previous studies, except
that subjects with the 10/10 genotype exhibited
lower auc values than did the subjects with the 1/10
genotypes (figure 4). although several studies
reported that cyp2d6 activity of subjects with the

10/10 genotype tended to be lower than that of
subjects with the 1/10 genotype (roh et al., 2001;
kim et al., 2003), wide variation in the enzyme
activity of the subjects with the 10 allele was also

qeeg response to aripiprazole
aripiprazole between cyp2d6 genotypes, provides
supportive evidence for a possibility that the
pharmacodynamics of aripiprazole differs according
to cyp2d6 genotypes.
this article has attempted to evaluate effects of
 xxxg656xxx  and cyp2d6 genotypes on pharmacodynamics
of aripiprazole. although our preliminary results are
not enough to be conclusive, cyp2d6 genotypes
appeared to have some influence on the change of
delta eeg power. the linear relationship between
auc and auec and the trend of different auc
according to cyp2d6 genotypes suggest that the
clinical effects of aripiprazole could be influenced by
cyp2d6 genotypes and that dose adjustment of
aripiprazole could be needed according to cyp2d6
genotypes. future study, where patients with schizophrenia are well stratified with respect to cyp2d6
genotypes, will be required to ascertain the effect of
cyp2d6 genotypes on pharmacodynamics of aripiprazole.
