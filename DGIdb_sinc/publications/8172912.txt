abstract

 xxxd2203xxx  is a novel sulfonylurea drug for treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with higher blood sugar
lowering efficacy in diabetic patients than  xxxd2215xxx  raising the question whether this characteristics is in line with different
binding of  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  to the 0-cell sulfonylurea receptor. scatchard plot analysis of [3h]sulfonylurea binding
to membranes isolated from rat 0-cell tumors and (rinm5f) insulinoma cells and to rinm5f cells demonstrated that
 xxxd2203xxx  has a 2.5-3-fold lower affinity than  xxxd2215xxx . this corresponded well to the 8-9-fold higher koff and 2.5-3-fold
higher kon rates of  xxxd2203xxx  compared to  xxxd2215xxx  as revealed by the dissociation and association kinetics of
[3h]sulfonylurea binding and the k d values calculated thereof. in agreement, the concentrations required for half-maximal
displacement of [3h]sulfonylurea bound to 0-cell membranes were significantly higher for  xxxd2203xxx  compared to  xxxd2215xxx . however, the binding affinity of  xxxd2203xxx  measured by both equilibrium binding and kinetic binding studies upon
solubilization of 0-cell tumor membranes and rinm5f cell membranes increased up to the value for  xxxd2215xxx . this was
primarily based on a drastic decrease of the dissociation rate constant of  xxxd2203xxx  whereas the kinetics of  xxxd2215xxx 
binding remained largely unaffected upon solubilization. these data suggest that the k d value alone is not sufficient for
characterization of a suifonylurea drug, since the kinetic binding parameters may also determine its acute blood sugar lowering
efficacy.

i. introduction

sulfonylurea drugs are widely used in the therapy of
niddm. the initial hypoglycemic effect of oral sulfonylurea administration appears to rely on the acute
stimulation of-the rate of insulin release from the
pancreas (yalow et al. [1]). at the molecular level
sulfonylureas are proposed to stimulate insulin secretion by binding to a receptor protein of the plasma
membrane of pancreatic/3-cells (for reviews, see [2,3]).
receptor occupancy has been shown to inhibit k+-efflux via a plasma membrane atp-regulated k+-chan -

nel in islet cells [4] and e-cell lines such as rinm5f [5]
or h i t t15 [6]. these channels also participate in the
control of insulin release by glucose [7] via changes in
the intracellular [atp]/[adp] ratio. subsequent depolarization of the plasma membrane causes opening of
voltage-dependent ca2+-channels. the rise in intracellular ca 2÷ triggers insulin release [8,9] (for a review,
see [10]). this chain of events couples the insulin
releasing effect and, thus, the primary hypoglycemic
capacity of sulfonylureas via the plasma membrane
electrical activity to their affinity to the/3-cell sulfonylurea binding sites which control the o p e n / c l o s e d
probability of the atp-regulated k+-channel by unknown mechanisms.
specific high-affinity binding sites (for a recent review, see ashcroft and ashcroft [11]) have been characterized previously in /3-cell tumor membranes [12-

14], rinmsf cell membranes and intact rinm5f cells
[15], mouse pancreatic islet microsomes [16], hamster
insulin-secreting tumor cell (hit t15) membranes
[14,17,18] and intact hit t15 cells [19]. in fact, a direct
correlation has been found for the sulfonylureas studied so far between their dissociation constants for
binding to/3-cell membranes and their ability to induce
insulin secretion and to lower the blood sugar [5,13,16].
for instance, the second generation sulfonylurea,
 xxxd2215xxx , is a 1000-fold more potent stimulator of
insulin secretion than first generation compounds such
as  xxxd3394xxx  in correlation with the 1000-10 000-fold
lower k d value of  xxxd2215xxx  compared to  xxxd3394xxx  [5]. using the receptor occupancy theory, it was
successful to predict the therapeutic blood concentrations and usual doses of sulfonylureas, based on the
good correlation between plasma unbound concentration, insulin releasing potency and k d values [20].
the novel sulfonylurea drug,  xxxd2203xxx , is characterized by a 2-3-fold higher efficacy in diabetic patients compared to  xxxd2215xxx  with respect to equivalence of the dose ranges leading to identical blood
sugar levels after oral administration (draeger, e.,
unpublished results). here we studied whether  xxxd2203xxx  exhibits higher binding affinity to the fl-cell
sulfonylurea receptor than  xxxd2215xxx  and found
that, in contradiction to this expectation, other (kinetic)
binding parameters may explain the lower therapeutic
doses required with  xxxd2203xxx .

2. materials and methods

materials.  xxxd2203xxx  ( xxxd2203xxx ),  xxxd2215xxx 
( xxxd2215xxx ),  xxxd3394xxx , [3h] xxxd2203xxx  (65 ci/mmol)
and [3h] xxxd2215xxx  (33 ci/mmol) were synthesized
at hoechst ag, frankfurt, germany [13,21]. a 10 mm
stock solution of  xxxd2203xxx  (made daily) was prepared by suspending 9.95 mg of  xxxd2203xxx  in 1.94 ml
aqua bidest., subsequent supplementation of 60/zl of 1
m naoh and warming up to 50-70°c. this solution
was either added directly (up to 1 : 200 dilution) to the
buffered assay mixtures containing membranes or cells.
radiolabeled sulfonylureas were diluted with 25 mm
hepes-koh (ph 7.8). scintillation cocktail acs ii was
provided by amersham-buchler, braunschweig, germany. collagenase, trypsin and proteinase inhibitors

were from boehringer, mannheim, germany. bsa
(fraction v, radioimmunoassay grade), rpmi-1640
medium, fetal calf serum and antibiotics were obtained
from sigma, deisenhofen, germany. all other reagents
(analytical grade) were provided from merck, darmstadt, germany. petri dishes and culture flasks were
purchased from nunc, roskilde, denmark. glass fiber
filters were from whatman, maidstone, uk. nitrocellulose filters were bought from millipore, eschborn,
germany. rats of the strain nedh (new england
deaconess hospital) were kindly donated by s. warren.
cell culture. rinm5f cells of the insulin-producing
cell line, derived from a rat islet cell tumor [22,23],
were grown in rpmi-1640 medium containing 10%
(v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 50 i u / m l penicillin, 0.25 /xg/ml  xxxd164xxx  and 50 ixg/ml streptomycin at 37°c in an atmosphere of humified air/co 2
(19:1) according to praz et al. [24] with the following
modifications: the cells were seeded at a density of
(2-4)" 104 cells/ml in 20 ml of medium (75 cm 2 culture flasks). the medium was replaced four times per
week (one passage). thereafter, the cells were treated
with trypsin (0.02% trypsin in 0.9%  xxxg2020xxx /0.2 mm
edta) for 2-5 min at 37°c. the trypsin-treated cells
were diluted, reseeded at a density of 2" 10 6 cells per
75 cm 2 culture flask and grown to 70% confluency.
preparation of rinmsf cell membranes. cells from
one culture flask were washed twice with ice-cold 25
mm hepes-koh (ph 7.4), 0.25 m sucrose, 0.5 mm
edta, scraped with 20 ml of the same buffer and
homogenized with 10 strokes of a tight fitting potterelvehjem homogenizer followed by sonication (bath
sonicator, 4°c, 10 s, maximal power). after centrifugation (200000 × g , 45 min, 4°c), the pellet was suspended in 10 ml of 25 mm hepes-koh (ph 7.4), 0.25
m sucrose, 100 mm  xxxg2020xxx , 0.5 mm edta, 200 /xm
pmsf and recentrifuged (1000 x g, 10 min). the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged (50000 x g, 30 min, 4°c). the pellet was
washed once with 25 mm hepes-koh (ph 7.4), 0.25
m sucrose and finally suspended in membrane buffer
(25 mm hepes-koh (ph 7.4), 0.25 m sucrose, 150
mm  xxxg2020xxx , 1 mm edta, 100 /.lm pmsf, 10 /xg/ml

pepstatin, 20 /xg/ml e-64, 1 mm iodoacetamide) at 5
mg protein/ml. aliquots were frozen in liquid n 2 and
stored at - 80°c.
preparation of fl-cell tumor membranes. non-malignant fl-cell adenoma tissue was dissected from rats of
the strain nedh after several transplantation cycles of
the insulinoma when the tumor has grown up to a
diameter of 2-3 cm as described previously (geisen et
al. [13]), homogenized in 50 ml of buffer a (25 mm
hepes-koh (ph 7.4), 0.25 m sucrose, 0.5 mm edta,
100 ~m pmsf) per g tissue in an ultraturrax (3 × 5 s,

max. power, on ice) and centrifuged (3000 × g, 5 min).
the supernatant was transferred into new tubes and
centrifuged (200000 × g , 60 min, 4°c). the pellet was
washed with 2 × 5 ml of buffer a, resuspended in 10
ml of buffer a per g tissue and centrifuged (75 000 × g,
30 min). the pellet was suspended in buffer a using a
tight-fitting dounce homogenizer.
binding of sulfonylureas to [3-cell membranes. filter
binding assays were performed in a total volume of 1
ml containing the indicated amounts of protein, 25 mm
mops-koh (ph 7.4), 0.1 mm cac12 and 0.1-20 nm
[3h]sulfonylurea. after incubation (25°c, 60 min for
equilibrium conditions or periods indicated for kinetic
experiments), the binding reactions were terminated by
rapid filtration through whatman g f / f filters soaked
in the same buffer. the filters were washed with 3 × 5
ml of ice-cold 25 mm hepes-koh (ph 7.4), 100 mm
naci, 1 mm edta, 200 /zm pmsf, 0.5 /zg/ml leupeptin, 0 . 7 5 / z g / m l pepstatin and 2 × 5 ml of ice-cold
h e p e s - k o h (ph 7.4), placed in 10 ml of acsii scintillation cocktail and after incubation overnight counted
for radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter. nonspecific binding in parallel samples was determined in
the presence of 1 /zm unlabeled ligand.
binding of sulfonylureas to solubilized [3-cell membrane proteins. isolated /3-cell tumor or rinm5f cell
membranes were diluted with 25 mm mops-koh (ph
7.4), 100 mm  xxxg2020xxx , 0.1 mm caci 2, 200 ~zm pmsf, 0.5
/ z g / m l leupeptin, 0.75 /xg/ml pepstatin, 50 /xg/ml
antipain dihydrochloride, 1 / z g / m l aprotinin at 1 mg
p r o t e i n / m l and solubilized by addition of 1 / 1 0 vol. of
10% digitonin and subsequent incubation (30 min, 4°c)
under gentle stirring. after centrifugation (200000 × g,
30 min, 4°c), indicated amounts of protein contained
in the supernatant were incubated with radiolabeled
ligand in a final volume of 1 ml (as described above).
the binding reactions were terminated by the addition
of 3 ml of ice-cold 15% p e g 8000, 25 mm mops-koh
(ph 7.4), 100 mm naci, 0.5 mm edta, 200 /zm
pmsf. after further incubation (15 min, 4°c), the
mixtures were filtered through nitrocellulose filters
(millipore, hawp, 0.22/xm) soaked with ice-cold 10%
p e g 8000. the filters were washed successively with 5
ml ice-cold 10% p e g 8000 and 4 × 5 ml 2% p e g
8000, dried, placed in 10 ml of acsii scintillation
cocktail and counted for radioactivity. background radioactivity, which was measured by filtration of binding
reactions lacking protein and accounted for up to 0.1%
of the total radioactivity added, was subtracted from
the total dpm values. non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 1 /zm unlabeled ligand.

specific binding of sulfonylurea drugs to isolated

glycemic efficacy between  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  prompted us to study its binding affinity to
isolated membranes from /3-cell tumors and rinm5f
cells as well as to rinm5f cells by equilibrium binding
using a filtration assay.
specific binding of [3h] xxxd2203xxx  and [3h] xxxd2215xxx  to/3-cell tumor and rinm5f cell membranes
at room temperature reached equilibrium within 50-60
min (see below) and was protein-dependent (0.05-0.3
mg /3-cell tumor membrane protein per ml or 0.1-0.5
mg rinm5f cell membrane protein) in a linear fashion
(data not shown). specific binding of [3h]- xxxd2203xxx 
and [3h] xxxd2215xxx  to rinm5f cells at 4°c was
dependent on the cell number ((0.2-5)" 10 6 cells/ml).
thus, 0.1-0.2 mg protein/ml and 1.5.10 6 cells/ml
used in the present study were well within the linear
range of the binding curves. specific binding of [3h] xxxd2203xxx  and [3h] xxxd2215xxx  to 100/zg of/3-cell

tumor and 200/zg of rinm5f cell membrane protein
at room temperature or to 1.5.10 6 rinm5f cells at
4°c increased from 0.1 to 10 nm radioligand and
exhibited saturability (data not shown). displacement
of [3h] xxxd2203xxx - and [3h] xxxd2215xxx -binding with
excess of the corresponding unlabeled compound revealed a moderate rise of non-specific binding with
increasing ligand concentration which, however, never
exceeded 20% (membranes) and 30% (rinm5f cells)
of the specific binding.  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx 
are characterized by comparable non-specific binding
to/3-cell membranes as well as to rinm5f cells.
scatchard plots derived from saturation experiments
were curve-linear suggesting the existence of both highand low-affinity binding sites in /3-cell tumor membranes, rinm5f cell membranes and rinm5f cells
(fig. 1, panels a-c). the k d values calculated under

periments were performed. displacement curves of
[3h] xxxd2203xxx - and [3h] xxxd2215xxx -binding (fig.
2) were used to calculate the concentrations for halfmaximal inhibition (ic50 values) (table 1). as expected
from the lower affinity of  xxxd2203xxx , this drug was
less p o t e n t in displacing b o u n d [3h] xxxd2203xxx  (panels

3 . 5 - 4 - f o l d higher concentrations of  xxxd2203xxx  and
about 1000-fold higher concentrations of  xxxd3394xxx 
were necessary to achieve half-maximal inhibition of
binding. this relationship emphasizes the specificity of
sulfonylurea binding to fl-cell membranes.

200/~g of rinm5f cell membranes (panel c) or 1.5.10 6 rinm5f cells (panel d) were incubated (various periods, 25°c for membranes or 4°c

fig. 4. dissociation kinetics of [3h]sulfonylurea binding to/3-cell membranes and b-cells. 100 ~g of/3-cell tumor membranes (panels a and b)
or 200 ~g of rinm5f cell membranes (panel c) or 1.5.106 rinm5f cells (panel d) were incubated (45 min, 25°c for membranes or 4°c for
cells) with 2 nm [3h] xxxd2203xxx  (+, e) or [3h] xxxd2215xxx  ([3, *) in the absence (total binding) or presence (non-specific binding) of 2 ~m
unlabeled sulfonylurea. at zero time, dissociation was induced by addition of unlabeled  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  (final conch. 2 izm),
respectively, to one half of each sample (d, +). the other half was left and incubated in parallel as a control (e, *). after the time periods
indicated, aliquots were immediately chilled, filtered and counted for radioactivity. specific binding calculated as difference between the total
and non-specific binding is given as percentage of specific binding at zero time (= 100%). each point represents the mean :l s.d. of 12 (9)
independent determinations using 4 (3) different membrane (cell) preparations. panel b displays the logarithmic plot of the ratio of sulfonylurea
bound at any time point (b(t)) to bound at equilibrium (b(e)) versus incubation time (t). the calculated dissociation rate constants (koff values)
are given in table 1.

account for its higher dissociation constant compared
to  xxxd2215xxx  as measured by equilibrium binding.
for this, the k d values were calculated as ratio between the dissociation and association rate constants.
for calculation of the kon rate, the association reaction
was treated as being pseudo-first order. fig. 3, panel b
displays the logarithmic plots of the ratio of ligand
concentration bound to /3-cell tumor membranes (not
shown for rinm5f cell membranes and rinm5f cells)
under equilibrium conditions to the difference of the
ligand concentration bound under equilibrium conditions and bound at each time point (t) versus time. fig.
4, panel b displays the koff rates as the logarithmic
plot of the ratio of ligand concentration bound at time
(t) to that bound initially under equilibrium conditions
versus time (not shown for rinm5f cell membranes
and rinm5f cells). as expected from the respective
half-life times, 2.5-3-fold higher association and 7-9fold higher dissociation velocities were calculated for
 xxxd2203xxx  compared to  xxxd2215xxx . the koff/kon
ratios (table 1) of  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  for
binding to fl-cell tumor membranes, rinm5f cell
membranes and rinm5f cells are well in line with
their k a values as determined by equilibrium binding.
thus, the lower binding affinity of  xxxd2203xxx  is explained by its binding kinetics. the logarithmic association and dissociation plots displayed non-linear curves.
the biphasic nature of the time-courses which was
more pronounced for  xxxd2203xxx  than for  xxxd2215xxx  points to the occurrence of either heterogenous (high- and low-affinity) sulfonylurea binding sites
or to cooperativity between two (or more) similar binding sites rather than to a bimolecular reaction involving
only one type of binding centre (see weiland et al. [28]
for a discussion of binding kinetics).

3.4. solubilization of [3-cell membranes alters the binding
characteristics of the  xxxd2203xxx -binding sites
so far it is unknown from which side of the /3-cell
plasma membrane sulfonylureas gain access to their
high-affinity binding sites and whether the drugs interact with the receptor from the aqueous environment or
from the lipid bilayer after lateral movement in the
plane of the membrane. the accessibility of the receptor for sulfonylureas may determine in part their binding characteristics and explain differences herein between drugs of different lipophilicity as is the case for
 xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx . therefore, we finally
studied the influence of the membrane environment on
the k d values and kinetic binding parameters of
 xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx . to allow measurement
of specific [3h]sulfonylurea binding to detergentsolubilized membrane proteins, the filtration assay was
modified by precipitation of the total incubation mixtures with peg in the cold prior to filtration over

nitrocellulose filters. the precipitates retained on the
filter were washed with ice-cold peg-containing washing solution. the protein dependence of specific
[3h] xxxd2203xxx  and [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding to solubilized /3-cell tumor membrane proteins, comparable
maximal binding capacities before and after solubilization and low (15-20%) unspecific binding (data not
shown) demonstrated almost quantitative recovery of
[3h]sulfonylurea specifically bound to solubilized/3-cell
tumor membrane proteins using the modified procedure. in contrast to/3-cell tumor membranes, rinm5f
cell membranes and rinm5f cells, low-affinity binding
sites for both sulfonylureas were barely detectable upon
solubilization of /3-cell tumor membranes. similar observations were made previously by niki et al. [29] for
hit t15 cell membranes.
the scatchard plot analysis shows that solubilization
by digitonin did only marginally affect the binding
parameters for  xxxd2215xxx  (fig. 5 compared to fig.
1). in contrast,  xxxd2203xxx  exhibited a 2.5-3-fold higher
affinity to solubilized fl-cell tumor membrane proteins
compared to membranes. this was also reflected in the

g. miiller et al. / biochimica et biophysica acta 1191 (1994) 267-277

creased up to the values of  xxxd2215xxx  for the
solubilized as well as membrane-embedded receptor
(table 1).

g d values calculated as koff/kon ratios from association and dissociation experiments (table 1). this rise
in affinity upon solubilization was based mainly on the
~ 4.5-fold reduction of the koff rate constant for
 xxxd2203xxx  (fig. 6, panels a and b) whereas the kon
rate constant decreased only ~ 0.7-fold (fig. 6, panels
c and d) compared to the value for membranes. in
marked contrast, the koff and kon r a t e constants for
 xxxd2215xxx  were only marginally affected upon solubilization of /3-cell membranes (fig. 6 and table 1).
consequently, the affinity of  xxxd2203xxx  to solubilized
/3-cell membranes was only slightly lower than of
 xxxd2215xxx . this was corroborated by the lower
concentrations of  xxxd2203xxx  but not of  xxxd2215xxx 
which were required for displacement of [3h] xxxd2203xxx  bound to solubilized /3-cell tumor (fig. 7, panel
a) and rinmsf cell (panel b) membrane proteins
compared to the respective membranes (see fig. 2). as
a result, the ics0 values of  xxxd2203xxx  for inhibition of
[3h] xxxd2203xxx  binding to the solubilized receptor de-

the present data strongly suggest that the lower
binding affinity of  xxxd2203xxx  to //-cell membranes
relies at least in part on the membrane environment of
the sulfonylurea receptor. however, this does not exclude the possibility that  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx 
actually bind to different receptor proteins which display different binding characteristics when embedded
within the fl-cell membrane. elucidation of this point
will require identification of the binding proteins, e.g.,
by means of photoaffinity labeling (kramer et al. [30];
see accompanying paper [31]).

fig. 7. displacement of [3h] xxxd2203xxx  binding to solubilized/3-cell
membrane proteins by sulfonylurea drugs. the experiments were
carried out as described in the legend to fig. 2 but using 100 ~g of
solubilized b-cell tumor (panel a) or 200/xg of rinm5f cell (panel
b) membrane proteins, respectively, and precipitation of the solubilized proteins with poly(ethylene glycol) prior to filtration.

of  xxxd2203xxx  with its receptor protein as well as of its
lower binding affinity compared to  xxxd2215xxx  remains a matter of speculation. (i) the initial decrease
of the blood sugar levels in dogs, rats and rabbits is
more pronounced after oral and intravenous administration of clear sodium salt solutions of  xxxd2203xxx 
compared to,  xxxd2215xxx  [21]. the rapid-onset blood
glucose lowering activity of  xxxd2203xxx  may be due to a
more rapid direct insulinotropic effect upon the islet of
langerhans. in agreement with this hypothesis, it was
found that in the perifused rat pancreatic islets and in
the isolated perfused rat pancreas,  xxxd2203xxx  released insulin more rapidly and more effectively than
 xxxd2215xxx  (geisen, k., unpublished results). this
may be related to the 3-fold higher kon rate of
 xxxd2203xxx  binding to /3-cell membranes. however,
with respect to the blood sugar lowering profile, it is
difficult to dissect differences in kinetic binding parameters from different pharmacokinetic behaviour of the
two drugs. (ii) the prolonged decline of plasma glucose
levels provoked by a single oral dose of  xxxd2203xxx 
compared to  xxxd2215xxx  in dogs and rabbits (geisen

[21]) may be explained by the 3-fold higher exchange
rate of  xxxd2203xxx  bound to the sulfonylurea receptor
if desensitization of the insulin releasing mechanism is
induced by occupancy of the sulfonylurea receptor with
a drug (exhibiting a lower exchange rate). desensitization of receptor mediated processes by permanent
binding of the ligand to its receptor involving distinct
molecular mechanisms is well established for several
hormone signaling pathways, i.e., /3-adrenergic receptors (for a review, see benovic et al. [32]). in this
respect, it is interesting that internalization of  xxxd2215xxx  has been reported for hit t15 cells (carpentier et ah [33]). if this based on endocytosis of the
sulfonylurea receptor when occupied by the ligand, it
may represent a mechanism for desensitization by down
regulation of the number of sulfonylurea receptors at
the cell surface which will be more pronounced for
sulfonylureas with lower exchange rate. however, the
long term hypoglycemic activity of sulfonylureas, in
general, and of  xxxd2203xxx , in special, may involve
so-called extra-pancreatic sites of action, in addition
(kolterman et al. [34]; mi]ller et ah [35]; for a review,
see gerich [36]). (iii) the higher k d value of  xxxd2203xxx  compared to  xxxd2215xxx  may be responsible
for the lower total decline of the blood sugar in the dog
(geisen [21]). clearly, these features would represent
significant therapeutical benefits for niddm patients.
