1 b-blockers are widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. however, their effects on
herg channels at comparable conditions remain to be defined. we investigated the direct acute
effects of b-blockers on herg current and the molecular basis of drug binding to herg channels
with mutations of putative common binding site (y652a and f656c).
2 b-blockers were selected based on the receptor subtype. wild-type, y652a and f656c mutants of
herg channel were stably expressed in hek293 cells, and the current was recorded by using wholecell patch-clamp technique (231c).
3 carvedilol (nonselective), propranolol (nonselective) and ici 118551 (b2-selective) inhibited
herg current in a concentration-dependent manner (ic50 0.51, 3.9 and 9.2 mm, respectively). the
ic50 value for carvedilol was a clinically relevant concentration. high metoprolol (b1-selective)
concentrations were required for blockade (ic50 145 mm), and atenolol (b1-selective) did not inhibit the
herg current.
4 inhibition of herg current by carvedilol, propranolol and ici 118551 was partially but
significantly attenuated in y652a and f656c mutant channels. affinities of metoprolol to y652a and
f656c mutant channels were not different compared with the wild-type.
5 herg current block by all b-blockers was not frequency-dependent.
6 drug affinities to herg channels were different in b-blockers. our results provide additional
strategies for clinical usage of b-blockers. atenolol and metoprolol may be preferable for patients with
type 1 and 2 long qt syndrome. carvedilol has a class iii antiarrhythmic effect, which may provide
the rationale for a favourable clinical outcome compared with other b-blockers as suggested in the
recent comet (carvedilol or metoprolol european trial) substudy.

introduction
in human cardiac ventricular cells, the principal repolarising
currents activated during the action potential plateau are the
rapidly (ikr) and slowly (iks) activating components of the
delayed rectifier k þ current (sanguinetti & jurkiewicz, 1990;
carmeliet, 1993), with ikr encoded by human ether-a-go-gorelated gene (herg or  xxxg1246xxx ) (curran et al., 1995;
sanguinetti et al., 1995; trudeau et al., 1995). pharmacological
blockade of herg currents exhibits antiarrhythmic effect by
lengthening of the cardiac action potential duration such as
the effects of class iii antiarrhythmic drugs, but excessive
prolongation of the action potential duration sometimes
leads to life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia, torsades
de pointes.

b-blockers are widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, coronary heart diseases,
chronic heart failure and congenital long qt syndrome ( xxxg1268xxx ).
in patients with congenital  xxxg1268xxx , b-blockers are reported to be
effective in suppressing life-threatening arrhythmia especially
in  xxxg1268xxx  and  xxxg1246xxx  patients (dorostkar et al., 1999; moss
et al., 2000; schwartz et al., 2001; shimizu et al., 2002).
however, nonselective b-receptor antagonist, carvedilol,
inhibits the herg potassium current by direct action on the
channels and prolongs the qt interval (cheng et al., 1999;
karle et al., 2001). propranolol overdose has also been
reported to cause prolongation of qt interval (farhangi
& sansone, 2003). question arises as which type of b-blockers
is the most suitable for the treatment of  xxxg1268xxx . on the other
hand, the recent comet (carvedilol or metoprolol
european trial) study suggested that carvedilol reduced the

k. kawakami et al

rate of sudden cardiac death compared with b1-receptor
selective antagonist, metoprolol, in patients with severe heart
failure (poole-wilson et al., 2003). since the life-threatening
arrhythmias are major cause of sudden cardiac death,
differences in electrophysiological actions of carvedilol and
metoprolol might be involved in the outcome of the study.
although the electrophysiological effects of b-blockers have
been studied in different species and expression systems, it is
important to compare the electrophysiological activities of
these drugs at comparable conditions (dupuis et al., 2005).
interactions of drugs with herg channels have been so far
most often studied in human embryonic kidney 293 (hek293)
cells or xenopus oocytes. however, hek293 cells are more
suitable for studying the drug affinity to herg channels
because the results correlate well with those observed in native
cells and in clinical practice (redfern et al., 2003).
in addition to class iii antiarrhythmic drugs, a remarkable
array of structurally diverse therapeutic agents that cause
acquired  xxxg1268xxx  are known to block herg or ikr channels
(viskin, 1999; roden, 2004; tamargo et al., 2004). one
possible explanation for this is that lack of a highly conserved
amino-acid motif (proline-x-proline) in herg s6 domains
compared with other potassium channels may cause the
herg channel pore and its vestibule to be uniquely large.
another important explanation for this is that these drugs
bind to a common drug receptor within the pore of herg
channels. using alanine scanning mutagenesis of the pore-s6
region of herg channel, aromatic amino-acid residues (y652
and particularly f656) were reported to be key determinants
of drug binding to herg channels (mitcheson et al., 2000).
therefore, it is useful to use these mutant channels to examine
the direct action of drugs on herg channels.
the aim of the present study was to investigate the direct
effect of various b-blockers on cloned herg potassium
channels expressed heterologously in hek293 cells and
compare the relative potencies of herg channels blockade.
in addition, we investigated the molecular basis of drug
binding to herg channels with the s6 domain mutations
(y652a and f656c).

the culture dish by trypsinisation, washed with d-mem, and
stored in this medium at room temperature for later use. the
cells in culture dishes were easily detached by trypsinisation
and studied within 8 h of harvest.

electrophysiological recordings
herg channel current was recorded using the whole-cell
patch-clamp technique at room temperature (23711c). the
transfected cells were transferred to a bath mounted on the
stage of an inverted microscope (diaphot, nikon, japan). the
bath was perfused with 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine ethane
sulphonic acid (hepes)-buffered tyrode solution containing
(in mm) 137 nacl, 4 kcl, 1.8 cacl2, 1 mgcl2, 10 glucose, and
10 hepes (ph 7.4). the volume of the bath was 0.6 ml and
the external solution in the bath was almost completely
exchanged within 1 min at a perfusion rate of 1.25 ml min1.
the internal pipette solution contained (in mm) 130 kcl,
1 mgcl2, 5 ethylene glycol bis (beta-aminoethyl ether)n,n,n0 ,n0 -tetraacetic acid (egta), 5 mg-atp, and 10
hepes (ph 7.2). the electrodes were constructed from
borosilicate glass using a micropipette puller (p-87, sutter
instrument co., novato, ca, u.s.a.) and heat-polished with
a microforge (mf-83, narishige, tokyo, japan). the final
resistance of the electrode was 3–5 mo when filled with the
pipette solution. membrane currents were recorded with an
axopatch 200b amplifier (axon instruments, union city, ca,
u.s.a.) and digitised at 2 khz with an analogue-to-digital
converter (digidata 1200b; axon instruments). the computer
software (pclamp ver. 8.1, axon instruments) was used to
generate voltage clamp protocols, acquire data and analyse
current traces.

chemicals
b-blockers were selected based on their receptor subtype.
propranolol (nonselective b-blocker), atenolol (selective
b-blocker) and ici 118551 (selective b2-blocker) were purchased from sigma-aldrich company (st louis, mo, u.s.a.).
metoprolol (a selective b-blocker) was purchased from mp

methods
dna constructs and transfection of hek293 cells
herg cdna (genbank accession number: u04270) was
subcloned into bamhi/ecori sites of the pcdna3 vector
(invitrogen, san diego, ca, u.s.a.). herg wild-type
channels were stably expressed in hek293 cell line as
described previously (zhou et al., 1998). herg y652a
(tyrosine to alanine at position 652) and f656c (phenylalanine
to cysteine at position 656) mutations were generated by sitedirected mutagenesis of wild-type herg cdna as described
previously (kikuchi et al., 2005). hek293 cells were transfected with this construct using the lipofectamine method
(invitrogen). stably transfected cells generated through  xxxg418xxx 
antibiotic selection were subcloned to achieve a uniform
herg expression level. the cells were cultured in dulbecco’s
modified eagle’s medium (dmem: life technologies,
gaithersburg, md, u.s.a.) supplemented with 10% foetal
bovine serum, 100 u ml1 penicillin and 100 mg streptomycin.
for electrophysiological analysis, the cells were harvested from

biomedicals (germany). these drugs were dissolved in distilled
water to prepare a stock solution. carvedilol, a nonselective
b-blocker with a-blocking action, was kindly provided by
daiichi pharmaceutical co. (tokyo, japan) and was dissolved
in dimethyl sulphoxide (dmso) to prepare a stock solution
(100 mm). the final concentration of the drug was prepared by
diluting the stock solution with tyrode solution. the highest
concentration of dmso used in the present study was 0.1%.
in preliminary experiments, the amplitudes of herg tail
current expressed in hek293 cells did not change significantly
after 3 min of dmso application at 0.1% (n ¼ 4). the
chemical structures of b-blockers used in the present study
are shown in figure 1. the molecular weight, b-receptor
selectivity (smith & teitler, 1999) and therapeutic plasma
concentrations of b-blockers used in the present study are
summarised in table 1.

for herg current measured at the end of the depolarising
steps and for tail current are shown. the control herg
current during the depolarising steps was maximal at about
0–10 mv, with tail current fully activated following steps to
10–20 mv. metoprolol (100 mm), carvedilol (1 mm), propranolol
(10 mm) and ici 118551 (10 mm) reduced the steady-state
current amplitude to 48.9710% (n ¼ 5), 34.678.6% (n ¼ 4),
32.176.4% (n ¼ 5) and 55.073.5% (n ¼ 7) of the control at
0 mv, respectively, and the peak tail current amplitude to
54.376.1% (n ¼ 5), 41.178.3% (n ¼ 4), 44.372.1% (n ¼ 5)
and 61.673.8% (n ¼ 7) of the control at 20 mv, respectively.
voltage-dependence of activation (figure 3) was also evaluated by plotting normalised tail current as a function of
voltage. normalised data were fitted with a boltzmann
function:

where imax is maximum amplitude, v1/2 and k are halfactivation voltage and the slope factor, respectively. after
application of the test drugs, the half-maximal activation
voltages significantly shifted in a negative direction compared
with the control (metoprolol 13.271.5 to 17.073.8 mv,
po0.05, n ¼ 5; carvedilol 11.071.3 to 21.371.8 mv,
po0.05, n ¼ 4; propranolol 15.172.4 to 29.574.9 mv,
po0.05, n ¼ 5; ici 118551 9.171.7 to 12.172.1 mv,
po0.05, n ¼ 7).
figure 4 shows the effects of b-blockers on the herg peak
tail current during a drug wash-in protocol at various drug
concentrations. herg current was elicited from a holding
potential of 80 mv by a 4-s depolarising step to 20 mv
followed by a repolarising step to 50 mv for 6 s, and the
protocol was applied every 15 s. after obtaining the control
record, b-blockers were applied to the bath. application of
metoprolol, carvedilol, propranolol and ici 118551 resulted in
a rapid herg channel blockade to reach a nearly steady-state
level within 5 min. the blocking effects were reversed gradually
during washout (45–88%). atenolol at 1 mm did not induce
marked reduction of the herg tail current.
the concentration–response relationship of drug block was
assessed by changes in the herg peak tail current amplitude
at 5 min after application of the drug. currents in the presence
of varying concentrations of b-blockers were normalised to the
control current amplitude and plotted as a function of drug
concentration. the concentration-response curves were obtained by using the hill equation:

data are expressed as mean7s.e.m., unless otherwise noted.
where applicable, n represents the number of cells studied.
statistical significance was analysed using a two-tailed
student’s t-test. p-values o0.05 were considered statistically
significant. curve fitting was performed using multiple nonlinear least-squares regression analysis (pclamp ver. 8.1,
axon instruments or sigma plot ver. 7.0, spss science,
chicago, il, u.s.a.).

figure 4 time course of b-blocker-induced herg tail current inhibition. herg currents were elicited every 15 s by the pulse
protocol shown at bottom right. metoprolol (a), carvedilol (c), propranolol (d) and ici 118551 (e) inhibited herg tail current in
a concentration-dependent manner and reached nearly a steady-state level within 5 min at each concentration. a partial recovery of
current was observed after drug washout. (b) atenolol at 1 mm did not significantly inhibit herg tail current.

metoprolol, carvedilol, propranolol and ici 118551 reduced
herg current amplitude in a concentration-dependent
manner but atenolol did not inhibit herg channels for up
to 1 mm (figure 5). the ic50 value and hill coefficient are
summarised in table 2.

attenuation of herg current blockade by carvedilol,
propranolol and ici 118551 in y652a and f656c mutant
channels
next, we assessed the molecular basis of drug binding to
herg channels using the herg y652a and f656c mutant
channels. figure 6a shows representative current recordings in
control conditions and 5 min after application of b-blockers in
y652a and f656c mutant channels. compared with the wildtype, herg channels blockade by carvedilol, propranolol and
ici 118551, but not metoprolol, was partially but significantly
attenuated in both the y652a and the f656c mutant channels
(figure 6b). we also assessed the concentration–response
relationships of the drug block by measuring the peak tail
current amplitude of y652a and f656c mutant current.
current reduction was evaluated at 5 min after application of
the drug, similar to the protocol used in the wild-type herg
channels. the results of the concentration-response relationships were plotted simultaneously with those of wild-type
channels (figure 5). the ic50 values and hill coefficients for
y652a and f656c mutant channels, and the relative ic50
values compared with wild-type (dic50) are summarised in
table 2.
british journal of pharmacology vol 147 (6)

frequency dependence of herg current block
finally, we investigated the frequency dependence of herg
current block by applying 35 repetitive pulses at 0.2 and 1 hz,
after holding the cell at 80 mv for 5 min during wash-in of
100 mm metoprolol, 1 mm carvedilol, 10 mm propranolol and
10 mm ici 118551. herg current was first rapidly activated
by a 100 ms step to 60 mv, which was followed by a 400 ms
step to 20 mv and a 200 ms step to 50 mv (see bottom of
figure 7). herg current was measured as the peak tail
current amplitude during the step pulse at 50 mv, and was
normalised to the control current measured prior to drug
exposure. for control conditions, the herg current amplitude during the pulse train did not change significantly
(o5%). following exposure to drugs, application of the pulse
train at either 0.2 or 1.0 hz decreased current amplitude. the
time course of herg current block was fit with double
exponential function:
af exp t=tf þ as exp t=ts þ base
where t is the pulse number; tf and ts are time constants of fast
and slow components; af and as are fractional amplitudes of
fast and slow components. the time constants of the fast and
slow components of the time course of block, and the amount
of steady-state block were not significantly different between
the 0.2 and 1.0 hz frequencies (table 3). the lack of
frequency-dependent block can be interpreted as the result of
fast onset of open channel block and slow unblocking.

discussion
in the present study, we examined the direct effect of b-blockers
on herg channels and the molecular basis of drug binding to
the channel using herg y652a and f656c mutant channels.
our major findings were: (1) propranolol, carvedilol and ici
118551 inhibited herg current in a concentration-dependent
manner. (2) high concentrations of metoprolol were required
for blockade, and atenolol did not significantly inhibit herg
current. (3) y652a and f656c mutations partially attenuated
the affinity for propranolol, carvedilol and ici 118551 but did
not alter the affinity for metoprolol.

values of 0.35, 3.59, 3.34 and 12.54 mm, respectively. it was
important that ikr was the most sensitive to carvedilol and that
the action potential duration was actually prolonged. the ic50
value for ikr blockade was very close to that determined in the
present study (0.51 mm). carvedilol has been reported also to
inhibit herg channels expressed in xenopus oocytes by
acting directly on the channels (karle et al., 2001). although
the ic50 value in the oocyte expression system (10.4 mm) was
much higher than those in native cardiac myocytes and
hek293 cells, the difference was attributed to the viteline
membrane and yolk of oocytes, which required up to 30-fold
higher concentrations for drug effects (madeja et al., 1997).
taken together, carvedilol blocks herg current at the range
of therapeutic concentrations in clinical use (0.1–0.6 mm)
(mcphillips et al., 1988), and has class iii antiarrhythmic
effect.

effects of b-blockers on herg channels

at high dose, propranolol was reported to prolong qt
interval (farhangi & sansone, 2003). more recently, propranolol has been reported to inhibit herg channels expressed
in chinese hamster ovary cells with an ic50 value of
9.971.3 mm (yao et al., 2005). the present study also
suggested that propranolol has an inhibitory effect on herg
current by binding to the putative common binding site.
however, the ic50 value (3.9 mm) was higher than the
therapeutic concentration (cmax: 0.14570.07 mm/20 mg p.o.,
mean7s.d., n ¼ 10, based on the information provided by the
manufacturer). thus, propranolol might have a less powerful
effect on qt interval at a clinically relevant concentration as
reported previously (linker et al., 1992; shimizu & antzelevitch, 1998; shimizu et al., 2002).
in contrast to carvedilol, atenolol and metoprolol did not
show significant effects on herg currents at least at
therapeutic concentrations (cmax: atenolol: 1.6470.14 mm/
50 mg p.o., n ¼ 12; metoprolol 0.4070.07 mm/120 mg p.o.,
n ¼ 12, based on the information provided by the manufacturer). the b1-selective antagonists have a single ring
compound in the common structure of b-blockers, while
nonselective and b2-receptor selective antagonists have other
ring compounds in addition to the common structure

(figure 1). these structural differences may contribute to the
drug affinity to herg channels.

herg channels have been studied recently in detail (mitcheson
et al., 2000; kamiya et al., 2001; milnes et al., 2003; sanchezchapula et al., 2003; scholz et al., 2003; perry et al., 2004). it
was demonstrated that aromatic amino-acid residues (y652 and
particularly f656) located in the s6 domain are the most
important molecular determinants of drug binding (mitcheson
et al., 2000). in the present study, y652a and f656c mutant
channels attenuated herg current blockade by carvedilol,
propranolol and ici 118551, suggesting that the binding of
these b-blockers involves a putative drug receptor within the
pore-s6 region of the herg channel. however, inhibition of
herg channels by most drugs tested to date was abolished or
markedly attenuated by f656 mutant channels except fluvoxamine and  xxxd1944xxx  (milnes et al., 2003; ridley et al., 2004).
in the present study, the drug affinities of carvedilol,
propranolol and ici 118551 were about five- to 11-fold less
to the y652a and f656c mutant channels than to the wild-type
channels. considered together, in addition to y652 and f656,
other amino-acid residues might be also involved in the
molecular determinant of drug binding. metoprolol decreased

effects of b-blockers on herg channels

figure 7 inhibition of herg tail current by b-blockers was not frequency-dependent. after the cell was held at 80 mv for 5 min
during exposure to 100 mm metoprolol (a), 1 mm carvedilol (b), 10 mm propranolol (c) and 10 mm ici 11855 (d), 35 repetitive pulses
(see protocol at centre bottom of the figure) were applied at 1 and 0.2 hz. solid lines represent fits to averaged data with double

herg current in a dose-dependent manner, but y652a and
f656c mutant channels did not significantly attenuate the
herg current blockade. since high dose of metoprolol was
required to block herg current, the drug-channel interaction
might be considered nonspecific although the involvement of
other amino-acid residues could not be excluded.

clinical implications
in the comet study (poole-wilson et al., 2003) and its
subanalysis (remme et al., 2004), carvedilol reduced the

mortality rate and sudden cardiac death rate more effectively
than metoprolol. although the mechanisms for this favourable
clinical outcome for patients treated with carvedilol are still
unknown, it is likely to be multifactorial involving the
blockade of b- and a-adrenergic receptors, a greater antiischemic effect, inhibition of apoptosis, an antioxidant action,
free-radical scavenging, and/or electrophysiological effect. in
the present study, we compared the class iii antiarrhythmic
effects of multiple b-blockers by estimating herg channel
blocking activity. the class iii antiarrhythmic effects were
significantly potent for carvedilol compared with other

b-blockers. carvedilol might provide favourable outcome via
class iii antiarrhythmic effects, in the context of b-blockade, in
chronic heart failure patients. thus, our results seem to provide
a hypothetical molecular explanation for the favourable
outcome in carvedilol treated patients in the comet study.
mutations in  xxxg1268xxx  (or  xxxg1268xxx ) are responsible for
defects in the slow component of the delayed rectifier
potassium current (iks) underlying the  xxxg1268xxx , whereas mutations in  xxxg1246xxx  (or herg) result in defects in the rapid
component of the delayed rectifier current (ikr) responsible for
the  xxxg1246xxx . life-threatening arrhythmias including torsades de
pointes tachyarrhythmia and sudden cardiac death tend to
occur with physical or emotional stress in patients with  xxxg1268xxx 
and  xxxg1246xxx  syndrome (schwartz et al., 2001). since adrenergic
stimulation results in qt prolongation on the surface ecg,
b-blockers have been considered to be effective in preventing
cardiac events especially in patients with  xxxg1268xxx  (dorostkar
et al., 1999; moss et al., 2000; schwartz et al., 2001; shimizu
et al., 2002). since the herg channel function is defective in
 xxxg1246xxx  patients and herg channel dependency is increased in
 xxxg1268xxx  patients, it is reasonable to consider that b-blockers
without herg channel blocking activity are more preferable
for the treatment of these patients. in the present study,
atenolol and metoprolol did not inhibit herg currents
significantly at least in clinically relevant concentrations. thus,
these drugs are suitable for treatment of  xxxg1268xxx  and  xxxg1246xxx 
patients. high concentrations of propranolol also blocked
herg channels in the present study. since overdose application of propranolol actually prolongs qt interval (farhangi &
sansone, 2003), propranolol may not be the best choice for the
treatment of patients with  xxxg1268xxx  and ltq2. in contrast,
carvedilol directly inhibited herg channels at clinically
relevant concentrations. thus, carvedilol might not be recommended in the treatment of patients with  xxxg1268xxx  and  xxxg1246xxx .

study limitations
the present study has certain limitations. we used herg
channels heterologously expressed in a human cell line. the
possible effects of b-blockers on other ion channels as well as
receptors in vivo should be considered. although the direct
inhibition of herg channels by binding to a common binding
site presented in this study is one of the mechanisms that
regulate herg channels, the existence of other pathways that
regulate herg channels has been reported. recent studies
revealed that increased intracellular levels of camp regulated
herg channels directly by binding to the cyclic nucleotide
binding domain and indirectly through camp-dependent
protein kinase (pka)-mediated phosphorylation of the chan-

effects of b-blockers on herg channels

nel protein, resulting in net reduction of herg current
(thomas et al., 1999; cui et al., 2000; 2001). these effects were,
at least in part, mediated by the activation of b1-adrenergic
receptors (karle et al., 2002). according to these results,
b-blockers without herg channel blocking activity competitively attenuate the b-receptor-mediated herg current
inhibition. on the other hand, b-blockers with herg channel
blocking activity have dual pathways to regulate cardiac
herg channels by both direct binding to the herg channels
and competitive antagonism with b-adrenergic agonists on their
receptor site. further studies are needed to identify the most
potent regulator of herg channel at various concentrations.
secondly, b-blockers, especially carvedilol and propranolol,
caused a negative shift in activation curves (figure 3). one
previous study reported that carvedilol did not shift the
activation curve in an oocyte expression system (karle et al.,
2001). in our preliminary experiments, we confirmed using
western blot analysis that b1-receptors are expressed on the
surface of hek293 cells (data not shown). since b-adrenergic
activation causes a positive shift in the activation curve (cui
et al., 2000), it is possible that inhibition of baseline activity of
endogenous b-receptors caused the negative shift of activation
curve and offset the current reduction induced by direct
herg channels block. the negative shift of the activation
curve may cause a net increase of current if other biophysical
parameters remain unchanged. one of the reasons for the lack
of current increase may be due to pronounced pharmacological blockade of herg channels.
finally, mink-related peptide 1 (mirp1), encoded by
kcne2, coassembles with the pore-forming herg subunit
and probably reconstitutes native ikr (abbott et al., 1999).
compared to channels formed by the herg subunit alone,
herg/mirp1 complexes show altered channel properties and
increase the potency of channel block by e-4031. moreover, the
mutant forms of mirp1 demonstrated diminished potassium
currents or increased channel blockade by drugs (sesti et al.,
2000). therefore, it is possible that drug sensitivity might be
different between herg and herg/mirp1 channels,
although wild-type mirp1 does not markedly influence the
drug sensitivity of the channels (numaguchi et al., 2000;
kamiya et al., 2001; scherer et al., 2002; friederich et al., 2004).
