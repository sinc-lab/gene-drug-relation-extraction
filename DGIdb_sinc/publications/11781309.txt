the sphingolipids are essential components of all eukaryotic
cells. they confer important structural properties to membranes and partition into microdomains that are believed to
organize proteins involved in signal transduction and membrane-trafficking pathways (3). in addition, sphingolipid metabolites are regulatory molecules for a variety of cellular processes (4 – 6). these bioactive sphingolipid metabolites are
formed as intermediates during both the synthesis and the

breakdown of the complex sphingolipids. many human diseases
that result from defects in sphingolipid catabolism have been
discovered (7), but examples of defects in sphingolipid biosynthesis that cause diseases have been lacking. however, it was
recently reported that hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1
( xxxg2194xxx ),1 the most common inherited peripheral neuropathy,
results from mutations in the lcb1p subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase ( xxxg102xxx ) (1, 2).
 xxxg102xxx  catalyzes the committed step in the synthesis of sphingolipids, the condensation of serine with  xxxd2832xxx  coa (see fig. 1
below). it is a member of the subfamily of pyridoxal 5⬘-phosphate
(plp) enzymes known as the ␣-oxoamine synthases that all
catalyze the condensation of a carboxylic acid coa thioester with
the ␣-carbon of an amino acid. the other ␣-oxoamine synthases
are 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase (aons), which catalyzes
the first step of biotin synthesis in escherichia coli (8), 5- xxxd148xxx  synthase (alas), which catalyzes the synthesis of
5-amino  xxxd2478xxx  during heme biosynthesis (9), and 2-amino- xxxd64xxx  coa ligase, which is involved in threonine
degradation (10). the  xxxg2194xxx  and  xxxg2195xxx  genes, found to be required for  xxxg102xxx  activity using genetic screens in saccharomyces
cerevisiae (11–14), encode proteins homologous to the ␣-oxoamine
synthases. homologs of the  xxxg2194xxx  and  xxxg2195xxx  genes from higher
eukaryotes have been identified based on their similarity to the
s. cerevisiae lcb genes (15).
the crystal structure of the aons enzyme reveals that several functionally important residues, including those that are
involved in plp binding, are highly conserved in the ␣-oxoamine synthases (16, 17). although lcb1p and lcb2p are homologous to each other and to aons (see fig. 2a below), many of
these conserved residues are present in lcb2p (for example,
lys-366, which is predicted to form a schiff’s base with plp),
but not in lcb1p. interestingly, a soluble lcb2p homodimeric
form of  xxxg102xxx  was recently characterized from the glycosphingolipid-producing bacterium sphingomonas paucimobilis (18).
however, in eukaryotes both proteins are required for  xxxg102xxx 
activity. thus unlike the other ␣-oxoamine synthases that are
soluble homodimers, the eukaryotic  xxxg102xxx  enzyme is membraneassociated, and enzyme activity requires both the lcb1p and
the lcb2p subunit. in comparison to the other members of the
family, lcb1p and lcb2p also have amino- and carboxyl-terminal extensions that may be important for membrane
association.

it was recently demonstrated that mutations in the
human  xxxg2194xxx  gene, encoding the lcb1p subunit of
serine palmitoyltransferase ( xxxg102xxx ), cause hereditary
sensory neuropathy type i (1, 2). as a member of the
subfamily of pyridoxal 5ⴕ-phosphate enzymes known as
the ␣-oxoamine synthases, serine palmitoyltransferase
catalyzes the committed step of sphingolipid synthesis.
the residues that are mutated to cause hereditary sensory neuropathy type i reside in a highly conserved
region of lcb1p that is predicted to be a catalytic domain of lcb1p on the basis of alignments with other
members of the ␣-oxoamine synthase family. we found
that the corresponding mutations in the  xxxg2194xxx  gene of
saccharomyces cerevisiae reduce serine palmitoyltransferase activity. these mutations are dominant and decrease serine palmitoyltransferase activity by 50% when
the wild-type and mutant  xxxg2194xxx  alleles are coexpressed.
we also show that serine palmitoyltransferase is an
lcb1p䡠lcb2p heterodimer and that the mutated lcb1p
proteins retain their ability to interact with lcb2p. modeling studies suggest that serine palmitoyltransferase is
likely to have a single active site that lies at the
lcb1p䡠lcb2p interface and that the mutations in lcb1p
reside near the lysine in lcb2p that is expected to form
the schiff’s base with the pyridoxal 5ⴕ-phosphate cofactor. furthermore, mutations in this lysine and in a histidine residue that is also predicted to be important for
pyridoxal 5ⴕ-phosphate binding to lcb2p also dominantly inactivate  xxxg102xxx  similar to the hereditary sensory
neuropathy type 1-like mutations in lcb1p.

dominant negative mutations in the lcb1p and lcb2p subunits of  xxxg102xxx 
the human homolog of the  xxxg2194xxx  gene,  xxxg2194xxx , is mutated
at cysteine 133 (c133w or c133y) or at valine 144 (v144d) in
 xxxg2194xxx  patients (1, 2). because the  xxxg2194xxx  mutations reside in a
region of lcb1p that has been conserved throughout evolution
(fig. 2) (13, 15), we characterized the corresponding mutations
in s. cerevisiae to gain insight into how the  xxxg2194xxx  mutations in
lcb1p might affect  xxxg102xxx  activity. in the studies reported here,
we show that the  xxxg2194xxx  mutations in yeast lcb1p dominantly
inactivate  xxxg102xxx . we also demonstrate that  xxxg102xxx  is an
lcb1p䡠lcb2p heterodimer. on the basis of modeling studies, we
predicted that the mutated cysteine in lcb1p resides in close
proximity to residues in lcb2p that are involved in plp binding. we mutated two residues in lcb2p that are predicted to be
important for plp binding and found that these mutant proteins also dominantly inactivate  xxxg102xxx .
experimental procedures

100,000 ⫻ g for 30 min, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube.
twenty ␮l of protein a-sepharose beads (125 mg/ml), which had been
prebound with 3 ␮l of monoclonal anti-ha antibody (babco), were
added to the solubilized microsomal protein. following a 2-h incubation
at 4 °c, the beads were washed three times, and 10% of the immunoprecipitated protein was subjected to 8% sds-page electrophoresis.
the methods used for immunoblotting and for detection of lcb1p and
lcb2p with the anti-lcb1p and anti-lcb2p antibodies were previously
described (20).
molecular exclusion fast-protein liquid chromatography—microsomal proteins were solubilized in 0.05 m tris, ph 7.5, 1 mm egta, 1 mm
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% sucrose monolaurate, loaded onto
a superose-12 fast-protein liquid chromatography column, and eluted
with the solubilization buffer at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. molecular
weight standards were added to the sample prior to application to the
column. fractions (0.5 ml) were concentrated and analyzed by sdspage electrophoresis on a 4 –20% gradient gel. molecular markers
were visualized by coomassie blue staining, and lcb1p and lcb2p were
detected by western blotting as described previously (20).
results

the  xxxg2194xxx  mutations in yeast lcb1p dominantly inactivate
 xxxg102xxx —the  xxxg2194xxx  gene is essential for viability, but  xxxg2194xxx ⌬ yeast
cells will grow if phytosphingosine (phs) is provided in the
medium (fig. 1). to determine the effect of the  xxxg2194xxx  mutations on  xxxg102xxx  activity, we made the corresponding mutations
(c180w, c180y, and v191d) in the yeast  xxxg2194xxx  gene (fig. 2).
the  xxxg2194xxx - xxxg2194xxx  alleles did not complement the phs-requiring phenotype of the  xxxg2194xxx ⌬ mutant. transformants carrying
centromeric plasmids harboring the  xxxg2194xxx -c180w allele were
unable to grow without phs under any conditions, whereas
those carrying the  xxxg2194xxx -c180y or the  xxxg2194xxx -v191d alleles
grew poorly at 26 °c and failed to grow at 37 °c (data not
shown). based on prior characterization of the growth phenotypes of  xxxg102xxx  mutants (20 –22) these results indicated that the
 xxxg2194xxx  mutations reduced  xxxg102xxx  activity. assays of microsomal
 xxxg102xxx  activity confirmed this conclusion (fig. 3a), because there
was no detectable  xxxg102xxx  activity in microsomes prepared from
the  xxxg2194xxx -c180w and  xxxg2194xxx -c180y mutant cells and about
10% of wild-type  xxxg102xxx  activity in microsomes prepared from
 xxxg2194xxx -v191d cells. these results demonstrated that the  xxxg2194xxx 
mutations in lcb1p severely compromise  xxxg102xxx  activity in yeast.
the yeast  xxxg2194xxx - xxxg2194xxx  alleles are loss-of-function mutations. assuming that the corresponding mutations also inactivate human  xxxg102xxx , the dominant  xxxg2194xxx  disorder could result
from haploinsufficiency or the mutations could be dominantnegative. we tested whether the  xxxg2194xxx - xxxg2194xxx  alleles were dominant by introducing them into haploid  xxxg2194xxx ⫹ yeast cells. an
 xxxg2194xxx ⫹csg2⌬ haploid strain was used, because it provided an
assay for reduced in vivo  xxxg102xxx  activity. cells lacking the csg2
gene fail to mannosylate inositolphosphorylceramide (ipc) and
therefore accumulate high levels of ipc (fig. 1), which leads to
ca2⫹ sensitivity (12). mutations that reduce ipc, including
those that reduce  xxxg102xxx  activity, suppress the ca2⫹ sensitivity of
the csg2⌬ mutant (12, 20 –22). introduction of the plasmidborne  xxxg2194xxx -c180w,  xxxg2194xxx -c180y, or  xxxg2194xxx -v191d allele into
the  xxxg2194xxx ⫹csg2⌬ haploid strain suppressed the ca2⫹ sensitivity indicating that the mutant alleles dominantly inactivated
 xxxg102xxx  activity in vivo (fig. 4a). microsomal  xxxg102xxx  activity measurements confirmed this, revealing a 2-fold reduction in enzyme activity (fig. 3b). these experiments demonstrated that
the  xxxg2194xxx - xxxg2194xxx  alleles were dominant inactivating mutations
that reduced in vitro  xxxg102xxx  activity about 50% when they were
coexpressed with a wild-type  xxxg2194xxx  allele, and that they also
reduced in vivo  xxxg102xxx  activity.
 xxxg102xxx  is an lcb1p䡠lcb2p heterodimer—we next investigated
the subunit structure of  xxxg102xxx . as mentioned above, the other
␣-oxoamine synthases, including a bacterial  xxxg102xxx  enzyme (18),
are soluble homodimers. however, eukaryotic  xxxg102xxx  is a membrane-associated enzyme comprised of two homologous sub-

yeast methods—yeast cells were grown according to standard procedures (19). the wild-type yeast strain was tdy2037 (mat␣ ura3–52
leu2  xxxg1852xxx   xxxg2332xxx  lys2), the csg2⌬ mutant was tdy2302 (mat␣ ura3–52 leu2
 xxxg1852xxx   xxxg2332xxx  lys2 csg2::ura3), the  xxxg2194xxx ⌬ mutant was tdy2507 (mat␣ ura3–52
leu2  xxxg1852xxx   xxxg2332xxx  lys2  xxxg2194xxx :: xxxg1852xxx   xxxg2332xxx ), and the  xxxg2195xxx ⌬ mutant was tdy2503 (mata
ura3–52 leu2  xxxg1852xxx   xxxg2332xxx  lys2  xxxg2195xxx :: xxxg1852xxx   xxxg2332xxx ). phytosphingosine (phs, 15 ␮m) and
0.1% tergitol was included in the medium for the  xxxg2194xxx ⌬ and  xxxg2195xxx ⌬
mutant cells.
construction of  xxxg2194xxx  and  xxxg2195xxx  mutant alleles—the  xxxg2194xxx  and  xxxg2195xxx 
mutant alleles were constructed by quikchange mutagenesis (stratagene). for the  xxxg2194xxx  mutations a prs315-based plasmid containing a
bamhi to kpni  xxxg2194xxx  fragment, which extended from 250 bp upstream
of the start codon to 135 bp downstream of the stop codon, was used as
template. the mutagenic primer pairs used to create the mutations
were: for c180y: 5⬘-tgtgggcgcctatggtcccgccg and its
complement; for c180w: 5⬘-tgtgggcgcctggggtcccgccg and
its complement; for v191d: 5⬘-cggtaaccaggacgatcattacacgttgg and its complement. for the  xxxg2195xxx  mutations a prs316-based
plasmid containing a avrii to ecori  xxxg2195xxx  fragment, which extended
from 680 bp upstream of the start codon to 345 bp downstream of the
stop codon, was used as template. the mutagenic primer pairs used to
create the mutations were: for k366t: 5⬘-atgggtactttcactacgtcgtttggtgctgct and its complement; for h334f: 5⬘-tttatcgatgaagccttttctataggcgctatg and its complement.
construction of the ha-tagged  xxxg2194xxx  and  xxxg2195xxx  alleles—attempts to
construct functional lcb1p or lcb2p with ha tags on the amino- or
carboxyl-terminal ends were unsuccessful. therefore, the tags were
placed internal to the coding sequence. the tagged alleles used in these
studies complemented their respective null mutants demonstrating
that they were functional. for the ha-tagged  xxxg2194xxx  allele, the ha tag
was inserted between codons 9 and 10 in the  xxxg2194xxx  gene. codons 9 and
10 were first converted to an avrii site in prs315- xxxg2194xxx  by quik
change mutagenesis using the primer 5⬘-acatcccagaggttttacctaggtcaataccgattccggca (the avrii site is shown in bold)
and its complement. a spei-ended triple-ha cassette (previously described) (20) was inserted into the avrii site. using the same strategy,
codons 53 and 54 of  xxxg2195xxx  were converted to an avrii site in prs316lcb2 and the spei-ended triple-ha cassette was inserted into the avrii
site. the primer pair used to introduce the avrii site in  xxxg2195xxx  was 5⬘ggtcatgttcacgacttcttacctaggaccttccaaaaaaacaaacatc and its complement.
 xxxg102xxx  assays—microsomes were prepared as previously described except that the cells were grown in minimal medium (to maintain selection for plasmids) to an a600 of ⬃1 and were then diluted 20-fold into
ypd medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, and 2% glucose) and
allowed to double four or five times prior to harvesting. this eliminated
the high background of  xxxd2832xxx  coa-independent incorporation of
radioactivity from serine into the organic phase, which was consistently
observed when microsomes prepared from cells grown in minimal medium were used for the  xxxg102xxx  assay. tlc analysis of the extracted
radioactive products confirmed that this labeled species was not a
long-chain base (data not shown).  xxxg102xxx  was assayed as previously described (20) using 0.4 mg of microsomal protein and 0.1 mm  xxxd2832xxx 
coa. each assay was conducted in quadruplicate, and the average  xxxg102xxx 
activity is reported.
immunoprecipitation and western blots—microsomal protein was
prepared as previously described (20), and 100 ␮g (at 1 mg/ml) was
solubilized with 0.1% sucrose monolaurate. following centrifugation at

shown that the mammalian  xxxg102xxx  enzyme is comprised of lcb1p
and lcb2p in a 1:1 stoichiometry. we addressed the oligomeric
structure of yeast  xxxg102xxx  to determine whether the enzyme is an

fig. 1. the sphingolipid synthesis pathway in yeast. serine
palmitoyltransferase ( xxxg102xxx ) catalyzes the decarboxylative condensation
of serine with  xxxd2832xxx  coa to form 3-ks in the first step of the
long-chain-base synthesis pathway. 3-ks is reduced to dhs by tsc10p
(22) and dhs is hydroxylated to phs by sur2p (28,29). addition of
3-ks, dhs, or phs to the growth medium rescues the lethality of  xxxg2194xxx ⌬
or  xxxg2195xxx ⌬ mutant cells. phs (or dhs) is n-acylated to form ceramide.
ceramide is inositol phosphorylated by aur1p (30) to form ipc, and ipc
is mannosylated in a step requiring csg1p and csg2p to form mipc
(12,31). the csg2⌬ mutant cells do not convert ipc to mipc and,
therefore, ipc levels increase, which leads to ca2⫹ sensitivity. mutations that reduce the accumulation of ipc in the csg2⌬ mutant cells
suppress ca2⫹ sensitivity (21). a second inositol phosphorylation step
converts mipc to m(ip)2c (32).

example, a tetramer of homodimers. for these experiments, we
generated ha-tagged lcb1p and ha-tagged lcb2p proteins. the
tagged proteins were found to be functional because they complemented their respective knock-outs (see “experimental procedures”); thus, they associate to form active  xxxg102xxx . untagged and
ha-tagged lcb1p or untagged and ha-tagged lcb2p were coexpressed in cells, and the solubilized microsomal proteins were
subjected to western blot analysis using anti-lcb1p or antilcb2p polyclonal antibodies. the untagged and ha-tagged lcb1p
and lcb2p proteins could be distinguished by their electrophoretic mobilities (fig. 5, lanes 4 and 6).
to address whether lcb1p (and/or lcb2p) could homodimerize, we investigated whether immunoprecipitation with anti-ha antibodies would pull down only the tagged protein or
both the tagged and untagged protein. using the solubilized
microsomes from the strain coexpressing ha-tagged and untagged lcb1p, the anti-ha antibodies precipitated a complex
containing the ha-lcb1p and lcb2p, but no untagged lcb1p
(fig. 5, lane 1). this demonstrated that lcb1p does not
homodimerize, because none of the anti-ha-precipitated
lcb1p䡠lcb2p complexes contained untagged lcb1p. using the
same strategy with solubilized microsomes prepared from the
strain coexpressing both untagged and ha-tagged lcb2p (fig.
5, lane 6), we also found that untagged lcb2p does not coimmunoprecipitate with ha-tagged lcb2p (fig. 5, lane 3). therefore, unlike the other ␣-oxoamine synthases, yeast  xxxg102xxx  is a
lcb1p䡠lcb2p heterodimer.
these immunoprecipitation data are consistent with the results of molecular exclusion sizing chromatography experiments (see “experimental procedures”). lcb1p and lcb2p coeluted with an estimated molecular mass of 110 kda (data not
shown), in reasonable agreement with the predicted heterodimeric molecular mass of 124 kda.
the  xxxg2194xxx  lcb1p mutant proteins are stable and heterodimerize with lcb2p—we found that the  xxxg2194xxx  mutant
lcb1p proteins were stable (fig. 6a, lanes 3–5). furthermore,
although lcb2p is unstable in the absence of lcb1p (20) (fig.
6a, lane 1), lcb2p is present in each of the mutants indicating
that the mutant lcb1p proteins form stable heterodimers with
lcb2p. this was confirmed by showing that the mutant lcb1p
proteins coimmunoprecipitate with lcb2p (data not shown).
mutations in the predicted plp-binding residues of lcb2p
also dominantly inactivate  xxxg102xxx —on the basis of the crystal
structure of aons and the alignment between aons and
lcb1p, the residue in aons gly-74 that is analogous to cys180 of yeast (cys-133 of human) lcb1p resides at the interface
between the subunits of the aons homodimer. it is in close
proximity to residues in the opposite subunit that are involved
in catalysis, including the lysine residue of aons that forms
the schiff’s base with plp (fig. 2b). this suggested that the
mutations in lcb1p might be affecting plp binding. indeed,
alexeev and coworkers (17) noted that mutations in this region
of aons might alter the dimer structure and affect the geometry of the plp binding site at the interface between the monomers to produce a loss of enzymatic activity. the aons-v85
(lcb1p-v191) residue is further from the interface, but mutations at this site may also alter the geometry of the plp
binding site by a long-range perturbation.
by analogy to aons, two residues in lcb2p (lys-366 and
his-334) that are predicted to participate in plp binding are
expected to lie across the subunit interface from cys-180 of
lcb1p. this is shown in a model of the central catalytic domain
of the lcb1p䡠lcb2p heterodimer that was generated using the
crystal coordinates of the highly homologous aons enzyme
(fig. 2c). the lys-366 residue of lcb2p (predicted to form the
schiff’s base with plp) was replaced with threonine and his-

the mutations (c180w, c180y, and

aons (gly-74 and val-85) that correspond to the mutations in yeast lcb1p

space-filling models. the alignment of
lcb1p and lcb2p with aons (fig. 1a)
was used to build a three-dimensional
model of the  xxxg102xxx  heterodimer by fitting
the lcb1p and lcb2p sequences to the
known three-dimensional structure of
aons (17) using modeler (33). the stereo
three-dimensional structures were drawn
using rasmol (34). heavy lines represent
two or more consecutive residues that are
conserved between the yeast and human
lcb1p and lcb2p proteins.

fig. 3.  xxxg102xxx  activity is reduced in
the lcb1p and lcb2p mutants. a and
b, the prs315 vector and a series of
prs315-based plasmids carrying the indicated  xxxg2194xxx  alleles were introduced into
either  xxxg2194xxx ⌬ mutant (a) or wild-type (b)
cells. c and d, the prs316 vector and a
series of prs316-based plasmids carrying
the indicated  xxxg2195xxx  alleles were introduced into either  xxxg2195xxx ⌬ mutant (c) or
wild-type (d) cells. microsomes were prepared from the transformed cells and assayed for  xxxg102xxx  activity as described under
“experimental procedures.”

334 (predicted to hydrogen-bond with o3⬘ of plp) was replaced
with phenylalanine, because these are the corresponding
amino acids in lcb1p (fig. 2a). we found that these mutations
in lcb2p also dominantly inactivated  xxxg102xxx  activity similar to
the  xxxg2194xxx -like mutations in lcb1p. centromeric plasmids carrying either the  xxxg2195xxx -k366t or the  xxxg2195xxx -h334f allele failed
to rescue the phs-requiring phenotype of an  xxxg2195xxx ⌬ mutant
(data not shown). assays of the microsomal  xxxg102xxx  activity from
these haploids confirmed that the mutations in  xxxg2195xxx  abolished
 xxxg102xxx  activity (fig. 3c). introduction of the mutant  xxxg2195xxx  alleles
into a haploid csg2⌬ xxxg2195xxx ⫹ strain suppressed the ca2⫹ sensitivity (fig. 4b) indicating that these mutant  xxxg2195xxx  alleles were
dominant and reduced in vivo  xxxg102xxx  activity. coexpression of the
wild-type and mutant lcb2p proteins reduced in vitro  xxxg102xxx 
activity by about 50% (fig. 3d). furthermore, these lcb2p
mutant proteins were stable (fig. 6b, lanes 3 and 4) indicating
that they retained their ability to heterodimerize with lcb1p.

therefore, substitutions in the lcb2p subunit of  xxxg102xxx  that may
disrupt plp binding, but do not eliminate heterodimer formation, were also found to be dominant inactivating mutations.
discussion

these studies clearly demonstrate that the  xxxg2194xxx -like substitutions in yeast lcb1p catalytically inactivate  xxxg102xxx . furthermore, mutations in predicted catalytic residues of the lcb2p
subunit that conferred similar phenotypes were also identified.
the mutant lcb1p and lcb2p proteins retained their ability to
associate with their partners to form catalytically inactive heterodimers. this suggests that there is no mechanism to upregulate  xxxg2194xxx  and  xxxg2195xxx  expression when  xxxg102xxx  activity is low,
because increased expression of the proteins would be expected
to restore 100%  xxxg102xxx  activity even if half of the heterodimers
were inactive. however, it should be pointed out that it is not
known whether the levels of lcb1p and/or lcb2p normally limit

 xxxg102xxx  activity. if a third protein limits  xxxg102xxx  activity, then the
dominant inactivation could result from its binding to the catalytically inactive heterodimers making it unavailable to optimally activate the functional heterodimers. in yeast the recently discovered tsc3p protein that associates with
lcb1p䡠lcb2p and stimulates  xxxg102xxx  activity severalfold (20) is a
candidate for a third protein that might limit  xxxg102xxx  activity.
the lcb1p subunit lacks several of the catalytic residues that
are conserved among the other ␣-oxoamine synthases, and this
has led to the notion that lcb1p might function exclusively as
a regulatory subunit. on the other hand, it is well established
that eukaryotic cells that lack lcb1p have no  xxxg102xxx  activity (24).

the recent identification of a bacterial  xxxg102xxx  enzyme that is an
lcb2p homodimer (18) raised further questions about the role
of lcb1p and about the oligomeric structure of the eukaryotic
enzyme. although mammalian  xxxg102xxx  was shown to consist of
lcb1p and lcb2p in a 1:1 stoichiometry (23), it remained possible that the oligomeric structure of the enzyme was higher
order, for example a tetramer of lcb2p and lcb1p homodimers.
the experiments presented here demonstrate that the native
yeast enzyme is a heterodimer.
in the aons homodimer there are two symmetrical active
sites that lie at the interface between the two monomers. in
particular, the signature lysine-containing plp-binding domain of one aons monomer lies across the interface from the
glycine-rich domain of the other monomer at each symmetrical
active site. because lcb2p has the lysine-containing predicted
plp-binding domain whereas lcb1p does not, it is likely that
the lcb1p䡠lcb2p heterodimer has a single active site. modeling
of the central catalytic domain of the lcb1p䡠lcb2p heterodimer
suggests that the  xxxg2194xxx  substitutions in lcb1p lie across the
subunit interface from predicted plp-binding residues of
lcb2p and may affect plp binding. the cysteine residue lies in
the conserved glycine-rich sequence that has been extensively
mutagenized in the alas enzyme. on the basis of these studies, ferreira and coworkers (25) concluded that this region of
the alas enzyme was important for plp binding and catalysis. as mentioned above, the crystal structure of aons also
provided evidence that this region is important in plp binding
(12). if, as the modeling studies suggest, the active site of  xxxg102xxx 
lies at the interface between the lcb1p and lcb2p subunits
with residues in lcb1p influencing plp binding, then lcb1p is
not simply a regulatory subunit.
our characterization of the mutant proteins shows that the
mutations do not grossly perturb the structures of the lcb1p or
lcb2p subunits. the proteins are stable and retain their association with their partners. bejaoui et al. (1) pointed out that
the cysteine residue in human lcb1p is in a potential consensus
site for n-myristoylation and raised the possibility that the
 xxxg2194xxx  mutations disrupt membrane association. however, this
cysteine residue of yeast lcb1p is not required for membrane
association, because the mutant lcb1p protein retains its association with the membranes. it would be surprising if the
mutations in human lcb1p were affecting membrane association, because they lie in the central domain of lcb1p within a
region that is conserved with the other soluble ␣-oxoamine
synthases. although this cysteine residue appears to be important for catalysis, it is unlikely that the sulfhydryl group participates directly in the catalytic chemistry, because the corresponding residue is a glycine in both aons and alas.
that the  xxxg2194xxx -like mutations in yeast lcb1p are dominant
inactivating mutations raises the possibility that the pathology
associated with the  xxxg2194xxx  neuropathy might result from reduced rather than increased  xxxg102xxx  activity. because  xxxg2194xxx  is a
dominant disease and lymphocytes from patients displayed
increased levels of glucosylceramides, it was suggested that the
mutations activate  xxxg102xxx  and thereby increase ceramide, which
in turn triggers apoptosis (2). although it is possible that the
 xxxg2194xxx  mutations have opposite effects on yeast and human
 xxxg102xxx  activity, it seems unlikely, because the residues that are
altered are in a particularly well-conserved region of lcb1p and
in a region of the protein that is known to be important for
catalysis in other ␣-oxoamine synthases. it will be important to
directly test the effect of expression of the  xxxg2194xxx -mutant lcb1p
proteins on  xxxg102xxx  activity in mammalian cells to resolve this
issue. if the  xxxg2194xxx  mutations do prove to dominantly inactivate
mammalian  xxxg102xxx , the increased glucosylceramides could reflect

an up-regulation of the glucosyltransferases in response to
reduced  xxxg102xxx  activity.
all eukaryotic cells have sphingolipids, although the abundance and types of sphingolipids vary in different cell types.
there is apparently a single  xxxg2194xxx  gene in humans. therefore,
regardless of whether the human mutations increase or decrease  xxxg102xxx  activity, the  xxxg2194xxx  patients could have abnormal
 xxxg102xxx  activity in all their cells. however, little is known about
the levels of  xxxg102xxx  activity in different tissues and about how the
enzyme is regulated. it may be that optimal  xxxg102xxx  activity is not
required for normal development and function of all types of
cells and tissues. for example, the  xxxg102xxx  deficiency may be most
acute in neuronal cells, because they are especially dependent
on normal sphingolipid synthesis. furthermore, it remains to
be determined whether the pathology of  xxxg2194xxx  results from
altered lipid composition of the neuronal membranes that renders them more susceptible to damage, or whether the altered
sphingolipid synthesis leads to an aberrant signaling process.
it will be of interest to compare  xxxg102xxx  activity and the lipid
composition in various tissues from unaffected and  xxxg2194xxx -afflicted individuals.
 xxxg2194xxx  is genetically heterogeneous with at least two loci (26,
27), and studies are underway to determine whether  xxxg2194xxx 
families that do not have mutations in  xxxg2194xxx  have mutations in
 xxxg2195xxx  (2). based on the results reported here, mutations that
catalytically inactivate lcb2p without compromising its ability
to heterodimerize with lcb1p, similar to those identified in this
study, are likely to be found in  xxxg2194xxx  patients. the potential to
alter  xxxg102xxx  activity using the dominant mutant alleles of  xxxg2194xxx 
and  xxxg2195xxx  should be useful for probing the functions of sphingolipids in higher eukaryotes. studies in cultured cells and
transgenic animals will provide the opportunity to establish
how altered  xxxg102xxx  activity influences the neural degeneration
that accompanies  xxxg2194xxx .
