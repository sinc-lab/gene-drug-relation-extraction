summary
a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric screening procedure ia described for the identification
and differentiation of the following aikyiamine antihi&amines and their metabolitea in urine: axatadine,  xxxd312xxx ,  xxxd375xxx ,  xxxd1676xxx , ( xxxd1663xxx ),  xxxd1785xxx ,  xxxd1894xxx , ketotifen, mebhydroline,  xxxd2904xxx ,  xxxd2906xxx , pyrrobutamine, ferfenadine and
tolpropamine. after acid hydrolyaia of the conjugates, extraction and acetyiation, the urine samples
were analysed by computerized gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. using ion chromatography
with the selective ions m/z 58,169,203,205,230,233,262
and 337, the presence of aikyiamine antihistamines and/or their metabolites was indicated. the identity of positive signals in the reconstructed ion chromatograms was coniirmed by a visual or computerized comparison of the stored full
mass spectra with the reference spectra. the ion chromatogams, reference mass spectra and gas
chromatographic retention indices (ov-101) are documented. the procedure presented is integrated
in a general screening procedure (general unknown analysis) for several group13of drugs.

introduction

the antihistamines (histamine hi-receptor antagonists) are one of the largest
groups of drugs, usually classified into alkanolamine, alkylamine, ethylenediamine, piperazine and phenothiazine derivatives. they are widely used as antiallergics, antiemetics and hypnotics. among the alkylamine antihistamines,
 xxxd1785xxx  also has antiserotoninergic properties. it is used as an appetite
stimulant. ketotifen is a selective mast-cell stabilizer used as an antiasthmatic.
alkylamine antihistamines may cause, alone or in combination with other drugs
*part of these results was reported at the “symposium klinisch-toxikologische anaiytik” of the
austrian and german societies of clinical chemistry, f&burg, september 14-16,1987 [ 11.

and their metabolites identified in urine after acid

and/or ethanol, an intoxication for which treatment is necessary [ 2,3]. because
alkylamine antihistamines used in ointments can be absorbed transdermally [ 4,
51, intoxications may occur, if large areas of skin, especially of children, have
been embrocated. fitness to drive a car may be impaired even after therapeutic
doses [ 6, 71. for all these reasons, alkylamine antihistamines may be encountered in clinical or forensic toxicological analysis. before quantification in plasma,
the drugs, which are usually unknown, must first be identified. the detection of
some of the alkylamine antihistamines using spectrophotometry [ 3-101, paper
chromatogrpahy [ 111, thin-layer chromatography [ 12,131, gas chromatography
[9, 14-161, high-performance liquid chromatography [17] and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) [ 16,13-201 has been described. however,
none of these procedures allows the rapid and specific identification and differentiation of all alkylamine antihistamines.
this paper describes a computerized gc-ms screening procedure for the identification and differentiation of alkylamine antihistamines and their metabolites
in urine. urine was used because the concentrations of alkylamine antihistamines and their metabolites are higher in urine than in plasma. because some of
the alkylamine antihistamines are excreted in urine in a completely metabolized
and conjugated form in the later phase of excretion, the conjugates were cleaved
by acid hydrolysis, which can be completed more quickly than enzymatic hydrolysis. this method has the advantage that it can be integrated in an existing

36

generalscreeningprocedure (generalunknownanalysis) for the detectionof several categoriesof drugs [ 21-321.
experimental

apparatus
a hewlett-packard (hp) series 5890 gfu9chromatographcombined with an
hp msd series 5970 mass spectrometerand an hp series59970 c workstation
were used. the gc conditions were as follows: splitless injection mode; column,
hp capillary (12 mx0.2 mm i.d.), cross-linked methylsilicone,0.33 p film
thickness;column temperature,programmedfrom 100“c to 310” c at 30”c/min,
initial time 3 min, final time 5 min; injection port temperature,270” c, carrier
gas, helium;flow-rate, 1 ml/min.
the ms conditions were as follows: scan mode; ionization energy, 70 ev, ionsource temperature,220’ c; capillarydirect interface heated at 260” c.
exact measurementof retentionindiceswas performedon a varianseries3700
gas chromatograph.the column effluent went to a flame ionization detector and
a nitrogen-sensitiveflame ionization detector after a 1:l split by a splitter made
from nickel tubing. the column was a steel tube (60 cm x 2 mm i.d.) packed with
chromosorb g hp (loo-120 mesh) coated with 5% ov-101. the column and
injector temperatureswere identical with those used for gc-ms, and the temperatureof the detectors was 270°c. nitrogen was used as carriergas at a flowrate of 30 ml/mm
urine samples
the investigationswereperformedon urinefrom in-patientstreatedwith therapeuticdoses of alkylamineantihistamines.when suitablesamplesfrom humans
were not available, urine from rats was used (see species column in table i).
rats were administered50 mg/kg body weightof drugsin aqueoussuspensionby
gastric intubation. urine was collected separatelyfrom faeces [ 331.
hydrolysis and extraction procedure
a lo-ml volume of urine was refluxed with 3 ml of 37% hydrochloric acid for
15 min. following hydrolysis,ca. 3 g of potassium hydroxidepellets were added
and the resulting solution was mixed with 10 ml of 30% aqueous ammonium
sulphateto obtain a ph between 8 and 9. this solution was extractedwith a loml portion of dichloromethane-2- xxxd3026xxx -ethyl acetate (1:1:3). phase separation was accomplishedby centrifugation.the organic extract was transferredto
a pear-shapedflask and evaporatedto drynessunder vacuum.
acetykation
the extracted residuewas acetylatedfor 30 min at 60’ c with 100 fl of a mixture of three parts of acetic acid anhydrideand two parts of pyridine. the acetylation mixture was then evaporatedto dryness and the resultantresidue was
dissolved in 100 ~1 of methanol. a 0.5-2 ~1 volume of this sample was injected
into the gas chromatograph.

37

gc-ms analysis
full mass spectra were recorded at a speed of 1 scan/s and stored on a hard
disk during the temperature-programmed gc analysis. the identity of positive
signals in the reconstructed ion chromatograms was confirmed by a visual comparison of the full mass spectra with reference spectra (fig. 1) or by a computer
library search [ 341.
results and discussion

the results of our studies are summarized in table i. using ion chromatography with the eight proposed ions, the possible presence of alkylamine antihistamines and/or their metabolites in urine could be indicated selectively.
complete or partial dehydration ( - hz0 in table i and fig. 1) for alcoholic hydroxy groups was observed. because these artifacts were formed during acid hydrolysis, the corresponding intact molecules were found after enzymatic
hydrolysis. the data of the antitussive  xxxd1663xxx  were included because of its
structural similarity to these antihistamines. most of the compounds are derivatized by acetylation (see derivative column). the mass spectra numbers in fig.
1, the molecular masses, the species from which the urine was assayed and the
gc retention indices are given. these indices were determined using temperature-programmed gc combined with flame ionization detection and nitrogensensitive flame ionization detection. in our experience, retention indices provide
preliminary indications of the possible presence of the compounds and may be
useful to workers without a gc-ms facility.
data are given for only those metabolites that were frequently found. not all
the listed metabolites were detected in each sample owing to inter-species (human/rat) or inter-individual differences in metabolism, or variable elapsed time
after administration. the mass spectra and retention indices of the less abundant
metabolites will be included in a forthcoming handbook and computer library
[34,35].
the data for androsterone, its dehydrated artifact and two unidentified endogenous biomolecules are included because these physiological compounds can be
indicated by the ion chromatograms.
the full mass spectra for the specific identification of the selectively indicated
compounds are shown in fig. 1. they are listed primarily in order of ascending
mass of the highest ion. for the same nominal mass value, the spectra are arranged in order of ascending retention indices. formulae are proposed for probable metabolite structures.
interferences by other drugs are improbable because the identity of the peaks
observed in the ion chromatograms can be positively confirmed by a visual comparison of the underlying mass spectrum with reference spectra (fig. 1 and ref.
35) or by a computer library search [ 341. the mass spectrum of 2-chlorobenzophenone, a metabolite of  xxxd1663xxx , is almost identical with that of 4-chlorobenzophenone, a common metabolite of the piperazine antihistamines  xxxd378xxx ,
etodroxizine, hydroxyzine and meclozine [ 321. however, the detection of the parent drugs and further unique metabolites allowed a differentiation.

fig. 2. ion chromatograms indicating the dehydrated n-desalkyldihydroxy metabolite of tertknadine
( 11, the dehydrated and acetylated n-desalkyl metabolite (2 ) and dehydrated terfenadine (3) (mass
spectra nos. 3,24 and 56 in fig. 1) .

the sensitivity of the method is sufficient to detect therapeutic concentrations
of at least those drugs that were studied in human urine.
to illustrate the method, ion chromatograms from the urine of a patient treated
with alkylamine antihistamines is shown in fig. 2. peak 1 indicates the dehydrated n-desalkyldihydroxy metabolite of terfenadine, peak 2 the dehydrated
and acetylated n-desalkyl metabolite and peak 3 dehydrated terfenadine (mass
spectra nos. 3,24 and 56 in fig. 1).
conclusions

the procedure presented allows the identification and differentiation of alkylamine antihistamines and their metabolites in urine to be integrated into a general screening procedure for the detection of several categories of drugs [ 21-321.
the identified drugs can then be quantified in plasma using methods described
by bruce et al. [36], dieckmann et al. [37], cailleux et al. [ 161 and jane et al.
[ 171, and reviewed by paton and webster [ 381.
