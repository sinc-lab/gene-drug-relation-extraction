in our recent studies using isolated guinea pig papillary
muscles, use dependent inhibition of the maximum
upstroke velocity (dv/dt,,,) of action potential with
 xxxd204xxx  was shown to be attenuated after additional
application of  xxxd2482xxx  or mexiletine.’ these
findings suggested that a combination of class i
antiarrhythmic drugs having high affinity to the
inactivated sodium channels (inactivation blockers34,
may cause a ‘lreductive”effect on dvidt,,,
probably
through their competitive interaction on the common
receptor site associated with cardiac sodium channels.
in the present study, we investigated such a
possibility more extensively in single ventricular
myocytes isolated from guinea pig hearts. single cell
experiments are considered to have a distinct
advantage over the previous multicellular tissue
experiments in the following respects. first,
membrane potential can be controlled more easily and
more correctly through the use of whole cell voltage
clamp technique.’ second, ion accumulation or
depletion in the narrow extracellular spaces durin
maintained depolarisation may be minimised.6 8
third, action potential configuration is not influenced
by electrotonic interactions with neighbour cells.
changes in dv/dt,
may, therefore, reflect more
directly those of the fast sodium inward current (ina)
available for excitation.

*

methods
single ventricular myocytes were enzymatically
isolated from guinea pig hearts by a procedure as
described in our previous report^.^ a few drops of
cell suspensions in kb medium’ were placed in a
recording chamber set on the stage of an inverted phase
contrast microscope (diaphoto, nikon coy tokyo).
the chamber was then perfused at a rate of 3 ml*min-’
with tyrode solutionhaving the following composition
(mmol-litre-’): nacl136.9, kc15.4, cacl2 1.8, mgc12
0.5, nah2p040.33, hepes 5.0, and glucose 5.0. the
ph was adjusted to 7.4 by adding naoh. the
temperature of the perfusate was kept at 35.0 c.
following a step increase in calcium concentration
of the medium to 1.8 mm (tyrode solution), 3040% of
myocytes deteriorated into round shaped cells due to
irreversible contracture, whereas the remaining cells
were tolerant to calcium; their intact rod shape was
maintained without spontaneous beating. the
experiments were carried out in the latter myocytes.

objective - the aim was to study an
interaction between class i antiarrhythmic drugs on
the cardiac sodium channels.
design
the single pipette, whole cell clamp
method was employed to control and record membrane potential. the maximum upstroke velocity
( d v / d a was measured as an index of sodium
channel availabfity during treatment of the preparations with aprindiae (5 fim) in combination with
meldletine (40 pm), and  xxxd2482xxx  (40 pm).
 xxxd2075xxx *mental material - single ventricular
myocytes (n = 6-8 per experiment) isolated from
guinea pig hearts were used.
measurements and main results - trains of
depolarisation to 0 mv (0.2-2.0 hz) were applied
from the resting membrane potential (-85 mv)
following a long quiescent period to evaluate “tonic”
and “use dependent” decrease (block) of dv/dt,,.
additional applicationof mexilethe or  xxxd2482xxx  to
aprindineresulted in an increase of tonic block and a
decrease of use dependent block. because of such
counteracting action, the steady state dvidt,.. during the train of depolarisation was unaffected for
medetine, and even increased for  xxxd2482xxx . dual
exponential components of dv/dt,recovery following a 1s conditioningdepolarisation after admixture of mexiletine or  xxxd2482xxx  to  xxxd204xxx  suggest
their competitive interaction on cardiac sodium
channels.
conclusion - a combination of class i antiarrhytbmic drugs having high affinitg for the inactivated state of sodium channels may cause a reductive effect on dvfdt,,,, throughcompetitivedisplacement from common receptors.

dv/dt, occurs was also kept constant (-+3 mv) by
such adjustment.
tonic and use dependent components of dv/dt,,
inhibition were investigated by using a train pulse
protocol (fig 1). following a rest period of 60 s allowing
full recovery of dvidt,
at the resting potential level
(-85 mv), a train of 250 ms depolarisationto 0 mv was
applied at a rate ranging from 0.2 to 2.0 hz. each
depolarising pulse was preceded by 4 ms window of
current clamp, during which action potential upstroke
to measure dvidt,, was elicited by the stimulus. the
membrane potential was voltage clamped for the
remainder of the period. the drug induced decrease in
dv/dt, for the fitst pulse was defined as tonic block,
and the decreasein dvidt,, during the train (from the
first pulse to the new steady state level) was defined as
use dependent block.
recovery from block (unblocking) was studied by
adding a stimulus to elicit test action potential from the
resting potential level (-85 mv) after a lo00 ms
conditioning clamp pulse to 0 mv. the coupling
interval between the clamp pulse and the test stimulus,
during which the myocyte was clamped at-85 mv, was
varied from 10 ms to 2 s.
all animals were cared for in accordance with
institutional policies and guidelines of nagoya
university.

the single pipette, whole cell clamp method5 lo was
employed to control and record membrane potential
using a single cell/single channel amplifier
(list-electronic, darmstadt, germany). the pipettes
were heat polished, and filled with internal solution to
produce a resistance ranging from 2 to 3 megohm. the
pipette solution consisted of (mmol-litre-'): kc1
120.0, nah2p04 10.9, egta 1.0, mgatp 5.0, and
hepes 10.0.the ph was adjusted to 7.3 by adding
koh. cell capacitance and series resistance were
compensated by analogue circuits. command
potentials were generated by a multichannel stimulator
(nihon-kohden tokyo, japan). when the action
potential was elicited, the voltage clamp mode was
switched to the current clamp mode using an electronic
relay regulated by the stimulator, and a square
depolarising suprathreshold current (2-4 ms) was
passed through the electrode. the upstroke of the
action potential was electronically differentiated to
measure dv/dt,,.
the output of the differentiatorwas
linear up to 1000 v-s-' and roll off occurred only at
frequencies above 200 khz.
our control experiments have shown that dv/dt,,
of single ventricular myocytes is unaffected by
stimulus intensity, provided the latency from the end
of stimulus to dvidt,
was less than 2 ms. further
prolongation of stimulus, however, resulted in a slight
but significant decrease in dv/dt,,.
in all the
experiments described below, the latency was kept
constant (0.5 to 1.5 ms) by adjusting the intensity of
stimulation pulse. the membrane potential at which

under drug free control conditions, dv/dt,, of the
a train of 250 ms depolarisation to 0 mv (0.2-2.0
hz) caused a significant decrease in dv/dt, only after test action potential recovered nearly completely
(about 95%) within 10 ms. in myocytes treated with
treatment with the drugs. the decrease in dvldt,,,
during the train (use dependent block) depended on  xxxd204xxx  (5 pm),mexiletine (40 pm) or  xxxd2482xxx  (40
pm) alone, an additional slower component of
dv/dt,,
recovery was observed. in the presence of
these drugs, dvidt,, of test action potential recovered
in a single exponential function as the coupling interval
was prolonged in steps from 100 ms up to 20 s. the
recovery time constant for  xxxd204xxx  (3180 ms) was
much larger than that for mexiletine (327 ms) and for
 xxxd2482xxx  (151 ms) (table). the fraction of sodium
channels blocked at the end of conditioning
depolarisation, which was estimated from the
exponential fit of dv/dt,,
recovery back to zero
coupling interval (y intercept), was more or less similar
(73.7-79.5%)for the three drugs (table).
recovery from block was also examined after
admixture of mexiletine (40 p m )or  xxxd2482xxx (40 pm)
with  xxxd204xxx  ( 5 pm). in such myocytes, dv/dt,,,
recovery of test action potential with coupling interval
longer than 100 ms contained two definable
exponential components. time constants of the fast
and slow components (71 and 72) corresponded to the
combined recovery time constant of dv/dtmaxafter
treatment with each drug alone (table). the fraction
blockade by the 72 (or  xxxd204xxx ) component was
reduced by 48%and 34%after admixture of mexiletine
and  xxxd2482xxx  respectively (table).

discussion
in the present day study, dv/dt, of single ventricular
myocytes was used to an approximate index of sodium
channel availability to infer changes in the drug
blocked sodium channels. the probably convex
shaped non-linear relationship between dv/dtmax
and
recovery from block
the peak ina in cardiac cells might introduce variable
recovery of dv/dt,,, was examined by introducing a errors in estimating the precise amount of sodium
test action potential with various coupling intervals channel block. '*-14 nevertheless, such a limitation
following a single conditioningdepolarisation to 0 mv, does not invalidate dvidt,,
as a qualitative index,
which was preceded by a 60 s rest period at -85 mv (fig since voltage clamp techniques currently available for
ina measurement require much more artificial

the frequency of depolarisation. with a single
application of  xxxd204xxx  (5 pm), significant use
dependent block was induced by a train even at 0.2 hz.
the intensity of block with  xxxd204xxx  was largely
enhanced at the higher frequency of depolarisation
(figs 3,4). in myocytes treated with mexiletine (40 pm)
or  xxxd2482xxx  (40 pm) alone, depolarisation trains at
rates higher than 1.0 hz caused a signifcant use
dependent block, but its intensity was appreciably less
than that with  xxxd204xxx ; at a rate 0.2-0.5 hz the block
was negligible.
after addition of mexiletine (40 pm)to  xxxd204xxx  (5
pm), the use dependent block of dvidt,
during
depolarisation trains at 0.2 and 0.5 hz was attenuated
by 10-15% from the value of single treatment with
 xxxd204xxx  (fig 3a). the block at 1.0 and 2.0 hz was
slightly attenuated, but the change was statistically
insignificant. because of this reductive effect on the
use dependent block, the steady state dvidt,, during
depolarisation trains in myocytes pretreated with
 xxxd204xxx  (5 pm) was unaffected by admixture of
mexiletine (40 pm) despite of the significant
enhancement of tonic block (fig 3b).
admixture of  xxxd2482xxx  (40 pm) with  xxxd204xxx 
(5 p m ) also caused a significant reduction in use
dependent block at rates of 0.5-2.0hz. the reduction
of use dependent block (15-20%) was more striking
than was the case with mexiletine (fig 4a). steady state
dv/dr,
a t 1.o and 2.0 hz was, therefore signtficantly
increased by 7.5-9.5% after the drug admixture,
despite of the increase in tonic block (fig 4b).

faster than that for  xxxd204xxx . this may explain the
attenuation of use dependent block.
the dv/dt,, inhibition is of prime importance for
the antiarrhythmic activity of class i drugs. because of
limited information available on combination
antiarrhythmicdrug therapy,19 ’‘there is at present no
clinical evidence for an attenuation of antiarrhythmic
activity of  xxxd204xxx  after admixture of mexiletine or
 xxxd2482xxx . based on the present results, however, it is
highly possible that such a combination of inactivation
blockers would attentuate their antiarrhythmic
potencies. further experimental and clinical studies
will be required to prove such an assumption.
this study was supported by grant-in-aid for scientific
research (02257103) from the japanese ministry of
education, science and culture.

conditions (low temperature and low extracellular
sodium concentration), which are known to have an
important influence on drug receptor interaction.l5
the membrane potential of myocytes during the
conditioning period was controlled by whole cell
voltage clamp technique. this allowed us to investigate
“tonic” and “use dependent” block of dv/dt,
without any change in resting membrane potential or
action potential configuration. thus the sodium
channel block during single and combined treatment
with drugs could be tested under the constant
condition.
additional application of mexiletine (40 pm) or
 xxxd2482xxx  (40pm)to  xxxd204xxx  (5 pm)resulted in an
increase in tonic block and a decrease in use dependent
block. because of such counteracting actions, the
steady state dv/dt,,, during the train of depolarisation
was unaffected with mexiletine, and even increased
with  xxxd2482xxx . these findings are concordant with
those observed in our previous experiments using
multicellular tissue preparations, where the use
dependent block was induced by trains of ordinary
stimulation.’ thus the reductive effect on dv/dt,, by
the combination of  xxxd204xxx  with mexiletine or
 xxxd2482xxx  has been confirmed in voltage controlled
single cell preparations.
in myocytes treated by a combinationof  xxxd204xxx  (5
pm)with mexiletine (40 pm) or  xxxd2482xxx  (40pm),
dv/dt,,,
recovery following 1 s conditioning
depolarisation was expressed by dual exponential
components. time constants for the fast and slow
components (71 and 72) corresponded to the values
obtained after single treatment with each drugs. in
addition, blocked fraction by 72 (or  xxxd204xxx )
component at the end of conditioning depolarisation
was reduced by 33.9-47.6%. these facts can be
explained most likely by competitive interactionof the
drugs on a common receptor site.’”’*  xxxd204xxx ,
mexiletine, and  xxxd2482xxx  are known to block sodium
channels mainly during the maintained plateau phase
of depolarisation corresponding to the inactivated state
(inactivation blockers). furthermore, blocking rates at
0 mv with mexiletine (40 p m ) and  xxxd2482xxx  (40pm)
were shown to be 2.5-3.7 times faster than that with
 xxxd204xxx  (3 p m ) . ~ these factors give mexiletineand
 xxxd2482xxx  a distinct advantage in competing against
 xxxd204xxx  at the blocking process. accordingly,
additional application of mexiletine or  xxxd2482xxx  at
sufficiently high concentrations would easily displace
the  xxxd204xxx  molecules from their common receptor
sites. such displacement of  xxxd204xxx  will result in a
progressively larger fraction of channels becoming free
from block during the diastolic period between
repetitive depolarisationsor action potentials, because
the unblocking rate of mexiletine and  xxxd2482xxx  from
the sodium channels at the resting potentials level
(which is reflected in the recovery of dv/dt,,,
following conditioning depolarisation) is 10-20 times
