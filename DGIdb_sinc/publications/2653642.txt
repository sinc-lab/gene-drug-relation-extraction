summary. to evaluate the previously reported depletion
of pancreatic somatostatin by  xxxd1787xxx  (fl- xxxd1787xxx ), mice were injected subcutaneously with the drug
at 300 mg/kg. immunocytochemical analysis performed on
sections from tissue taken at 4 h after the injection revealed
an elimination of  xxxg2205xxx -1ike immunoreactivity
without alterations in the  xxxg2205xxx ~1_ 12)-like immunoreactivity. in sections from tissues taken at 24 h after
injection, no differences between  xxxd1787xxx -injected animals and controls were observed. immunochemical analysis
of  xxxg2205xxx -1ike immunoreactivity in pancreatic extracts showed a significant reduction of the concentration
(p < 0.001). in contrast, no change in the insulin concentration was observed. functionally,  xxxd1787xxx  lowered the
plasma glucose levels at 1 h after injection; this effect persisted for 6 h. plasma insulin levels were likewise reduced
transiently by  xxxd1787xxx . concomitant administration of
somatostatin did not influence these effects of  xxxd1787xxx .
the plasma glucose-lowering effect of  xxxd1787xxx  was seen
also in alloxan-diabetic mice. we conclude that  xxxd1787xxx 
alters the immunoreactive characteristics of pancreatic somatostatin without affecting the immunoreactivity of insulin, and that  xxxd1787xxx  transiently reduces plasma glucose
and insulin levels

tion of somatostatin (sorenson et al. 1983; takahashi et al.
1985; sako et al. 1986). this could infer the use of  xxxd1787xxx  as a tool for investigating the physiological role of
somatostatin in islet function, and, indeed,  xxxd1787xxx  has
been shown to increase basal insulin secretion in islets of
mice (petersson and hellerstr6m 1985) and to potentiate
glucose-induced insulin secretion in islets of rats (patel et al.
1985). however, there are also observations of unaffected
insulin secretion (sorenson et al. 1983; silvestre et al. 1986)
as well as inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (petersson and hellerstr6m 1985; ostenson and efendic 1985)
after administration of  xxxd1787xxx . whether these effects
are caused by direct actions of  xxxd1787xxx  or by the somatostatin-depleting effect has not been established, particularly since it has been made plausible that  xxxd1787xxx  does
not reduce the total content of tissue somatostatin but rather renders  xxxg2205xxx  non-immunoreactive (patel and
pierzchala 1985). in fact, electron-microscopic immunocytochemistry has revealed that  xxxd1787xxx  does not affect the
number of  xxxg2205xxx  antigenic sites in the pancreas
(patel et al. 1987). therefore, we performed the present
study to evaluate further the nature of the  xxxd1787xxx -induced depletion of immunoreactive somatostatin in the
pancreas, and to explore its possibility as a tool for investigating consequences of somatostatin depletion of plasma
levels of insulin and glucose in the mouse.

materials and methods
the ulcerogenic agent  xxxd1787xxx  (fl- xxxd1787xxx )
has been shown to cause immunochemical and immunocytochemical depletion of somatostatin in the pancreas, the
gut, and in the central nervous system (szabo and reichlin
1981; sagar et al. 1982; palkovits et al. 1982; sorenson
et al. 1983; seiler et al. 1983; patel and pierzchala 1985;
patel et al. 1985; petersson and hellerstr6m 1985; cameron
and fernstrom 1986; petersson 1987; widmann and sperk
1987). in the pancreas,  xxxd1787xxx  has been reported to
cause both a depletion of islet somatostatin (sorenson et al.
1983; petersson and hellerstr6m 1985; ostenson and
efendic 1985; patel et al. 1985; silvestre et al. 1986; hashimoto et al. 1987; petersson 1987) and to inhibit the secresend offprint requests to : dr. bo ahrbn, department of pharmacology, s61vegatan 10, s-223 62 lund, sweden

animals

female mice of the n m r i strain (anticimex, stockholm,
sweden), weighing 25 35 g, were used. the animals were
kept on a standard pellet diet (astra-ewos, s6dertfilje, sweden) and tap water ad libitum before and throughout the
experiments.

drugs

 xxxd1787xxx  hydrochloride (fl- xxxd1787xxx ) and  xxxg2205xxx  (sigma chemical co, st louis, mo, usa)
were dissolved in saline (0.154 mol/1) with addition of 0.1%
gelatine. alloxan monohydrate (british drug houses ltd,
poole, england) was dissolved at ph 5.0, and diluted in
saline to 8 mg/ml.

tions of acetonitrile and 0.1 m phosphate buffer at ph 3.5
(30/70 v/v). the assay allows measurement of somatostatinlike material with a detection limit of 8 pg/ml. the antiserum crossreacts with  xxxg2205xxx ~l_28~ and with tyrsomatostatin-28~15 28) to 100%, but does not recognize
 xxxg2205xxx ~1 12).
hplc (high-performance liquid chromatography) of
somatostatin-immunoreactive material in extracts from the
pancreas was performed on a waters system using a labondapak c-18 reverse phase column (waters associate,
milford, ma, usa). a linear gradient of acetonitrile
(30-55%) during the first 60 min was followed by 10 rain
of isocratic elution at 55% acetonitrile (flow rate 1.0 ml/
min). fractions of 0.5 ml were collected, lyophilized and
assayed for somatostatin-like immunoreactivity after reconstitution in 0.05 m phosphate buffer, ph 7.4, containing
0.25% human  xxxg124xxx .

functional experiments
 xxxd1787xxx  was injected subcutaneously at dose levels of
30-300 mg/kg to unanesthetized normal or alloxan-diabetic
mice. controls were injected with saline. blood samples
were taken from the retrobulbar plexus before and at various time intervals after the injections. the animals were
then sacrificed, and tissue collected for immunocytochemistry and radioimmunoassay. in one experimental series,
mice were given an intravenous injection of alloxan (80 rag/
kg) at 3 days prior to the  xxxd1787xxx  injection for induction
of diabetes (rerup and lundquist 1967). in another experimental series,  xxxg2205xxx  was injected subcutaneously
at 6, 60 or 600 nmol/kg, alone or concomitantly with the
subcutaneous injection of  xxxd1787xxx  (100 mg/kg).

immunocy tochemistry
small pieces of pancreas were fixed in bouin's fixative, subsequently rinsed, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and
sectioned at 5 lam. alternatively, specimens were immersed
in stefanini's fixative and subsequently rinsed in sucrosecontaining tyrode solution, frozen on dry ice, and cryosectioned at 15 ~m. hydrated sections were incubated with
3 different antisera to somatostatin, as well as with antisera
to insulin, glucagon, or  xxxg1823xxx . details concerning the antisera are given in table 1. the sections were
eventually processed according to the indirect immunofluorescence method of coons et al. (1955).

immunochemistry of somatostatin
to determine the somatostatin concentration, the pancreas
was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. the tissue was weighed
in the frozen state, stored at - 8 0 ~
(for 3 weeks at the
most) and subsequently extracted (in boiling 0.5 m acetic
acid for 10rain) and homogenized (polytron, 1-2 rain).
after centrifugation (1500g, 20 min), the supernatants were
collected and lyophilized and then stored at - 3 0 ~ c. extracts were reconstituted in 0.05 m phosphate buffer
(ph 7.4) containing 0.25% bsa, and the concentration of
immunoreactive somatostatin was determined with a radioimmunoassay by the use of a somatostatin antiserum (code
no k 18; ferring ab, malm6, sweden) at a final dilution
of 1 : 500000. tyr~-somatostatin was iodinated by the chloramine t-method and the iodinated tyr-somatostatin was
purified by hplc using a ~t-bondapak c-18 column
(waters associate, milford, ma, usa) and isocratic condi-

determinations of insulin and glucose
plasma and pancreatic concentrations of insulin were determined by a radioimmunoassay (heding 1966) using ~25ilabelled porcine insulin and guinea-pig anti-porcine insulin
with rat insulin as standard (novo res, bagsvaerd, denmark). for the pancreatic insulin determinations, pancreatic tissue was homogenized in acidified alcohol (75% ethanol, 0.18 m hc1). plasma glucose levels were determined
with the glucose oxidase method (bruss and black 1978).

statistics
means and sem are calculated. for statistical evaluation
of the data, student's paired and non-paired t-test as well
as analysis of variance (anova) were employed.
results

immunocytochemistry
for all pancreatic specimens, a significant and selective loss
of islet  xxxg2205xxx -1ike immunoreactivity, but not of
islet  xxxg2205xxx ~l 12)-like immunoreactivity, was
found at 4 h after  xxxd1787xxx  treatment (fig. 1). when examined at 24 h after  xxxd1787xxx  injection, islet  xxxg2205xxx -1ike immunoreactivity was at a level comparable to
that found in controls. thus, whereas  xxxd1787xxx  did not
affect islet  xxxg2205xxx ~l 12) immunoreactivity, it transiently reduced the  xxxg2205xxx -immunoreactivity. no
impairment in the immunostaining of insulin, glucagon, or
 xxxg1823xxx  was observed by  xxxd1787xxx  (figs. 2,
3).

immunochemistry
 xxxd1787xxx  induced a small and transient reduction of the
pancreatic content of  xxxg2205xxx -like immunoreactivity to 262+6 ng/g tissue at 4 h after injection compared
with 331 _+9 ng/g tissue in controls (p<0.001) (fig. 4). in
contrast,  xxxd1787xxx  did not affect the pancreatic concentration of insulin (fig. 4). hplc analysis of pancreatic extracts from control animals revealed two major somatostatin-immunoreactive peaks with the elution positions of  xxxg2205xxx ~l_ 28) and  xxxg2205xxx , respectively.  xxxd1787xxx  caused a reduction in the concentration of immu-

plasma glucose and insulin levels
 xxxd1787xxx  lowered the plasma glucose levels (fig. 6). the
effect was demonstrable at 60 min after the subcutaneous
injection and persisted for 6 h, whereafter a return to control values was observed. a dose-response study revealed
that at 30 mg/kg,  xxxd1787xxx  did not affect plasma glucose
levels, whereas at 100 and 300 mg/kg, the hypoglycemic
effect was observed (fig. 7). plasma insulin levels were tran-

siently lowered by  xxxd1787xxx  at 300 mg/kg at 1 h after
injection, i.e., at a time point when plasma glucose levels
had declined (fig. 6). since no apparent change in plasma
insulin levels preceded the change in plasma glucose levels,
it could be hypothesized that  xxxd1787xxx  induced the hypoglycemia by a non-insulin-dependent mechanism. to test this
hypothesis, alloxan-diabetic mice were injected with  xxxd1787xxx , and, again,  xxxd1787xxx  (300 mg/kg) induced a suppression of plasma glucose levels with the same time-pattern
as in normal mice (p<0.001 ; fig. 8). finally, in order to
investigate whether the hypoglycemic effect of  xxxd1787xxx 
is mediated by a reduction of somatostatin activity, mice

discussion

in accordance with previous reports, our results from radioimmunoassay analysis of pancreatic extracts show that after
a single administration of  xxxd1787xxx , there is a marked
reduction in the pancreatic somatostatin concentration
(sorensen et al. 1983 ; petersson and hellerstr6m 1985; ostenson and efendic 1985; patel et al. 1985; silvestre et al.
1986; peterson 1987 ; hashimoto et al. 1987). we observed
the reduction at 4 h after administration. at 24 h after  xxxd1787xxx  administration, however, the pancreatic somatostatin concentration had returned to control values. our resuits further show that, in the pancreas,  xxxd1787xxx 
immunocytochemically affects the  xxxg2205xxx -1ike immunoreactivity but not the  xxxg2205xxx ~_ ~2)-like immunoreactivity. this indicates that somatostatin is not generally depleted from the pancreas. instead,  xxxd1787xxx 
might render the somatostatin molecule immunologically
non-recognizable. this might be induced by possible conformational changes, although other rearrangements at the
molecular level cannot be excluded. in addition, the results
from h p l c indicate a reduced concentration of  xxxg2205xxx -1ike material, indicating that  xxxd1787xxx  afflicts
mainly the  xxxg2205xxx -1ike material, whereas there
seems to be an increase in the  xxxg2205xxx -1ike material
in the extracts. this findings confirm previous studies also
in the jejunum and in the stomach (szabo and reichlin
1985; patel and pierzchala 1985). a recent study by mcintosh et al. (1988) also showed that  xxxd1787xxx  induces a
reduction of the somatostatin-like immunoreactivity in the

gastro-intestinal tract and the pancreas. however, that
study also showed that a separate somatostatin-specific antibody could not confirm the reduction of somatostatin in
jejunum and pancreas, which suggests that  xxxd1787xxx 
might induce specific confirmational changes in the somatostatin molecule resulting in reduced immunoreactivity.
this conclusion also seems to be in line with the findings
that  xxxd1787xxx  decreases pituitary prolactin immunoreactivity possibly by breaking up its disulfide bridges (schammel and dannies 1984; jacobs and lorenson 1984; lorenson and jacobs 1984; sagar et al. 1985). at least, however,
the action of  xxxd1787xxx  appears to require the environment
of the storage granules, since simply incubating  xxxd1787xxx 
with  xxxg2205xxx  or prolactin does not affect the immunoreactivity of the peptides (palkovits et al. 1982; patel
et al. 1985; widmann and sperk 1987). whether this alteration in immunoreactivity correlates to reduction in biologi-

ated, since islet somatostatin is assumed to exert a paracrine
inhibitory action on both insulin and glucagon secretion
(taborsky 1983; samols et al. 1986). two previous studies
appear to support this view: glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from cultured neonatal rat islets or freshly isolated
adult rat islets was augmented by  xxxd1787xxx  (kanatsuka
et al. 1984; patel et al. 1985). however, insulin secretion
from the perfused rat pancreas was not affected by  xxxd1787xxx  (sorenson etal. 1983; silvestre et al. 1986) and in
two studies  xxxd1787xxx  even inhibited insulin secretion (ostenson and efendic 1985; takahashi et al. 1986). furthermore,  xxxd2215xxx -induced insulin secretion from isolated
rat islets appeared to be unaffected by  xxxd1787xxx  (sako
et al. 1986). these results therefore suggest either that somatostatin has no overt paracrine action within the islets,
or that  xxxd1787xxx  does not affect the bioactivity of islet
somatostatin, or that  xxxd1787xxx  exerts effects not related
to the action on the somatostatin immunoreactivity.
our present study shows that, in the mouse,  xxxd1787xxx 
induces a transient reduction of plasma glucose levels. since
we show that this reduction (a) is not preceded by increased
plasma insulin levels, (b) is not counteracted by somatostatin administration, and (c) is retained in alloxan-diabetic
mice, we conclude (1) that it is exerted by extrainsular actions of  xxxd1787xxx , and (2) that it is not mediated by any
reduction in somatostatin activity. the exact mechanism
is, however, not known. in rats,  xxxd1787xxx  induced adrenocortical necrosis, which theoretically could depress plasma
glucose levels (mccomb et al. 1981). however, this action
is first seen at 8 h after  xxxd1787xxx  administration. other
mechanisms could be alterations by  xxxd1787xxx  of circulating levels of other hormones like prolactin, growth hormone, fl-endorphin or adrenaline (brown et al. 1983; millard et al. 1983 ; 1983 b; 1985), or by an action of  xxxd1787xxx 
that lowers the liver glucose delivery, and/or interferes with
glucose absorption.
plasma insulin levels were transiently reduced after  xxxd1787xxx  administration, which was probably secondary to
the lowered plasma glucose levels. the transient return of
plasma insulin levels to baseline levels, despite hypoglyce-

mia, could theoretically by due to  xxxd1787xxx -induced reduction of islet somatostatin activity, since the return of
plasma insulin levels occurred at a time when the  xxxg2205xxx  i m m u n o s t a i n i n g within the islets was low. however, since a hyperinsulinemia persisted for 3 days, i.e., also
at time-points when the  xxxg2205xxx  immunoreactivity
had returned to normal, there was no overt correlation between insulin and somatostatin.  xxxd1787xxx  seems therefore
not to be a proper drug to use when exploring the role
of somatostatin in islet function. a direct effect of  xxxd1787xxx  on insulin secretion can, however, not be excluded,
but is unlikely considering, for example, the failure of  xxxd1787xxx  to affect insulin secretion from the perfused rat
pancreas (sako et al. 1986).
we summarize that (1)  xxxd1787xxx  induces a transient
reduction in islet  xxxg2205xxx -1ike immunoreactivity
without affecting the  xxxg2205xxx -1ike immunoreactivity, (2)  xxxd1787xxx  induces hypoglycemia by extrainsular
mechanism(s), and (3) there is no correlation between the
changes induced by  xxxd1787xxx  in islet  xxxg2205xxx  immunoreactivity and plasma insulin levels.
