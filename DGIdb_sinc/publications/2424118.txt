 xxxd3522xxx  antagonism of coumarin intoxication in the rat.  an in vitro system which expresses all enzyme activities related to  xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylation of blood clotting factors was prepared from livers of rats overdosed with warfarin, difenacoum and  xxxd1875xxx  respectively. in this system, the activities of the two pathways that are known to produce active reduced vitamin k1 cofactor for the carboxylation reaction were measured. also the ability of high concentrations of vitamin k1 to overcome inhibition of clotting factor synthesis was studied. in the systems prepared from livers of warfarin and difenacoum intoxicated rats, pathway i was inactive.  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductase was also inactive which strongly suggests that this enzyme catalyzes the activity of pathway i in vivo. reduction of vitamin k1 by pathway ii bypassed the inactive pathway i and resulted in carboxylation activity. this pathway therefore mediates the antidotic effect of vitamin k1 in the coumarin intoxicated liver. in the in vitro system prepared from  xxxd1875xxx  intoxicated livers the activity of pathway i was not significantly affected.  xxxd1875xxx  however was a strong inhibitor when added to liver microsomes in vitro.
