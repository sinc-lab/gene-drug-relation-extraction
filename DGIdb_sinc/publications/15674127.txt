thology in patients with fabry disease3;
female patients with rapidly deteriorating renal function4; and the potential for
safe and effective therapy.5
it has been shown that patients
with fabry disease had significantly
poorer mean solid gastric emptying than
that of a normal control group (40% vs
67%; p < 0.005), including 5 of 7 patients
with symptoms.6 this may imply that
less efficient gastric emptying may be a
feature of fabry disease and, hence, enzyme-replacement therapy may impact
gastrointestinal symptoms. this is a further reason to institute enzyme replacement early, since the profile of the pediatric population frequently includes gastrointestinal involvement. 7 also,
anecdotal reports of gastrointestinal involvement in fabry disease have invariably been chronic, such as celiac disease,
or catastrophic, including jejunal diverticulosis with perforations.
parenthetically, it is of interest that
crohn’s disease, a disease with added
risk in first-degree relatives, and with
suspected background of a subclinical inflammatory background, had been diagnosed in both the patient and her mother.8
in conclusion, whereas crohn’s
disease has never been reported in a patient with fabry disease, the current case
highlights several relevant issues pertaining to fabry disease, its signs and
symptoms, and potential for enzyme
therapy, in female patients.

reactive hepatitis in a
patient with crohn’s
disease successfully
treated with infliximab:
does tumor necrosis
factor alpha play a role
in reactive hepatitis?
to the editor:
crohn’s disease (cd) is associated
with a wide range of hepatobiliary lesions. although clinical liver disease is
unusual in cd, abnormalities of serum
aminotransferases are relatively common.1 concerning the activity of the idiopathic inflammation of the gut, hepatic
manifestations can be differentiated into
those that depend on the activity of the
basic disease and those lacking this dependence. we report a case of cd with
biochemical and histologic evidence of
hepatic inflammation during flare-ups of
intestinal disease. a nonspecific form of

reactive hepatitis associated with cd
was diagnosed, introduction of infliximab improved endoscopic lesions as
well as biochemical markers of hepatic
lesion.
in 1997, a 21-year-old white female presented with bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. stool
samples were negative for parasites and
pathogenic bacteria. a colonoscopy with
ileoscopy was preformed, and aphthous
ulcers were found in terminal ileum and
sigmoid colon; the cecum, ascendent,
and transverse colon had longitudinal ulcerations. histologic examination was
consistent with ileocolic cd. at diagnosis, alterations were detected in the results of liver tests:  xxxg941xxx  (alt), 198 iu/l (normal, < 37); aspartate aminotransferase (ast), 68 iu/l
(normal, < 37); alkaline phosphatase,
440 iu/l (normal, < 90); and gammaglutamyl transferase (ggt), 206 iu/l
(normal, < 49). there were no identifiable risk factors for hepatic disease;
hepatitis b virus, hepatitis c virus, and
human immunodeficiency virus were all
negative and thyroid function tests were
within normal range. antinuclear antibodies, antismooth, muscle antibodies,
anti-liver-kidney microsomal antibodies,
antimitochondrial antibodies, and antineutrophil citoplasmatic antibodies of
perinuclear type were negative. the tests
for hemochromatosis, wilson’s disease,
and ␣1-antitrypsin deficiency were negative. endoscopic and magnetic resonance
cholangiography showed normal extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile ducts. on
liver biopsy, there were intralobular
necroinflammatory lesions with mild
portal fibrosis and inflammatory infiltrate limited to the portal tracts. piecemeal necrosis, granulomas, or bile duct
lesions were not observed.
the patient began receiving prednisolone (40 mg/d) and  xxxd2579xxx  (3
g/d). her bowel symptoms improved, she
gained weight, and there was a reduction
of acute phase reactants: sedimentation
rate (sr) and  xxxg520xxx . after 4
weeks of therapy, the aminotransferase

levels returned to normal, with only a
slight increase in ggt (68 ui/l), and
prednisolone was gradually tapered off.
in 1998, the administration of  xxxd2579xxx  was stopped. because of frequent
cd relapses manifested by diarrhea, abdominal pain, elevated sr, c-reactive
protein, and aminotransferases levels
with steroid dependency, in 1999 she was
put on azathioprine (2 mg/kg) and, a year
later, infliximab was added (5 mg/kg).
a relationship was found between
sr and the activity index score of harvey
and bradshaw2 and elevated levels of
both alt and ggt (figs. 1 and 2),
showing that the periods of clinical activity were accompanied by alterations of
liver tests results. upon infusion of infliximab, there was a reduction of disease
activity, and it was possible to stop the
administration of corticosteroids. in the
first months of therapy, the patient began
receiving infliximab every 8 weeks,

and currently she is receiving infliximab
treatment on demand. after the administration of infliximab, the harvey and
bradshaw activity index and sr were occasionally high (flares), although not accompanied by abnormalities of liver tests
(figs. 1 and 2). in fact, in our patient
there was a relationship between sr and
both alt and ggt levels: the slope of
the linear regression of alt/sr was 2.41
(r2, –0.57) and that of ggt/sr was 2,80
(r2, –0.52). after introduction of infliximab for controlling bowel disease, the
aminotransferase levels gradually returned to normal and the slope of
alt/sr was 0.025 (r2, –0.0010) and that
of ggt/sr was 0.40 (r2, –0.11). these
findings suggest that, while receiving infliximab treatment, episodes of clinical
activity, as expressed by a high harvey
and bradshaw activity index and sr,
were not accompanied by alterations of
alt and ggt levels. presently, the pa-

tient stopped receiving corticosteroids,
and the aminotransferases and ggt were
within the reference range. a new colonoscopy preformed during march 2001
showed deformity of ileocecal valve and
pseudopolyps in the ascendent and transverse colon, but without ulceration. liver
biopsy displayed, at this stage, unspecific
reactive inflammatory changes in portal
tracts and intralobular parenchyma, without fibrous septation or signs of biliary
duct lesions.
the specific incidence or prevalence of hepatobiliary disease in cd still
remains to be defined and depends on the
extent of diagnostic evaluation used.1
wewer et al3 studied 125 patients with
cd and found in 38 (30%) some form of
abnormalities in liver function test
results; however, in many of these patients the alterations were temporary and
no further diagnostic evaluation was
needed. our patient had persistent increases in alt and ggt levels, and
these alterations were related to periods
of activity, strongly suggesting a reactive
hepatitis related to inflammation induced
by cd. in an epidemiologic study of the
incidence of uc in a county of stockholm between 1955 and 1979, the most
common explanation for transient abnormalities in liver function was active colitis. 4 it is tempting to speculate that
mechanisms responsible for hepatic and
intestinal inflammation could share some
common features controlled by infliximab and mediated by tumor necrosis
factor (tnf)-␣. in fact, infliximab (an
antibody directed to tnf-␣) was efficient in controlling the liver test results,
which returned to normal values, regardless of the flare-up of ibd and the persistence of mild nonspecific lesions in the
liver (noticeable, there was no evolution
of hepatic lesions).
the role of tnf-␣, a potent proinflammatory cytokine, in the pathogenesis
of liver diseases has been documented in
several studies, both in humans and in
animal models.5,6 for instance, it has
been suggested that liver-associated t
lymphocytes are involved in the inflammatory process associated with alcohol-
