abstract
histone deacetylases ( xxxg1033xxx ) have been identified as therapeutic targets due to their regulatory function in dna
structure and organization.  xxxd2839xxx  is a novel inhibitor of
class i and ii hdacs. we studied the effect of  xxxd2839xxx  and
ionizing radiation (ir) on dna repair in two human non–
small cell lung cancer (nsclc) cell lines ( xxxd1322xxx  and h460).
;- xxxg1009xxx  foci present at dna double-strand breaks (dsbs) were
detected in the nuclei following 3 gy irradiation for up to 6
hours.  xxxd2839xxx  administered before irradiation increased the
duration of ;- xxxg1009xxx  foci beyond 24 hours. furthermore,
radiation alone induced translocation of  xxxg1036xxx  to the
nucleus. in contrast, treatment with  xxxd2839xxx  followed by
irradiation resulted in  xxxg1036xxx  confinement to the cytoplasm,
indicating that  xxxg1033xxx  inhibition affects the nuclear localization of  xxxg1036xxx . the findings that  xxxd2839xxx  confines  xxxg1036xxx  to
the cytoplasm and increases the duration of ;- xxxg1009xxx  foci in
irradiated cell lines suggest that  xxxg1036xxx  participates in dna
damage signaling following ir. annexin- xxxd3027xxx  iodide
flow cytometry assays, cell morphology studies, and cleaved
caspase-3 western blot analysis revealed a synergistic effect of
 xxxd2839xxx  with ir in inducing apoptosis. clonogenic survival
showed a greater than additive effect when  xxxd2839xxx  was
administered before irradiation compared with irradiation
alone. in vivo tumor volume studies showed a growth delay of
20 days with combined treatment compared with 4 and 2 days
for radiation or  xxxd2839xxx  alone. this study identifies  xxxg1036xxx  as
a biomarker of  xxxd2839xxx  activity and recognizes the ability of
 xxxd2839xxx  to sensitize human nsclc to radiation-induced dna
dsbs. (cancer res 2006; 66(23): 11298-304)

introduction
dna methylation and histone deacetylation are the major
epigenetic pathways identified that regulate gene expression (1).
histone modification plays an important regulatory role in many
cellular processes, including gene transcription (2, 3) and
proliferation (4). transcriptionally active genes have high levels
of core histone acetylation, whereas transcriptionally inactive genes

have low levels (5, 6). the balance between these two states is
regulated by two enzymes: histone deacetylase ( xxxg1033xxx ) and histone
acetyltransferase. it is estimated that 4% to 12% of genes are
regulated by histone acetylation/deacetylation (7). abnormal
transcriptional repression occurs in many forms of cancer, and
hdacs have been implicated in this process (7). for this reason,
hdacs have been identified as molecular targets in cancer therapy
(7–10). previous studies have shown  xxxg1033xxx  inhibition to result in
cell growth arrest, differentiation, apoptosis, and alterations in
gene expression in cancer cell lines (11, 12).
in addition to promoting growth arrest by themselves,  xxxg1033xxx 
inhibitors have been shown to have synergistic effects with
cytotoxic cancer therapy (13–16). this synergy is related to the
inhibition of dna repair (17) and synthesis (18). due to its ability
to enhance the effects of anticancer therapy and the potential low
side effect profile,  xxxg1033xxx  inhibitors are a promising new class of
antineoplastic pharmaceuticals.
non–small cell lung cancer (nsclc) is often refractory to therapy
due to late presentation and relative resistance to nonsurgical
treatment modalities. surgery remains the treatment of choice with
5-year survival rates of 24% to 61% (19). unresectable lung cancer
shows resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and recurrences are common within the field of irradiation (20). improved
effectiveness of nonsurgical treatments has the potential to improve
patient outcomes by decreasing recurrence rates and providing
more effective therapy to nonsurgical candidates.
 xxxd2839xxx  is a novel cinnamic hydroxamic acid analogue  xxxg1033xxx 
inhibitor currently in early clinical trials (21). the compound has
been shown to induce acetylation of histones h3 and h4 and hsp90,
increase p21 levels, and induce g1 cell cycle arrest in hematologic
malignancies (22, 23). in the present study, the effects of  xxxd2839xxx  on
irradiated nsclc were studied.  xxxd2839xxx  enhanced radiationinduced apoptosis. furthermore,  xxxg1033xxx  inhibition increased the
duration of g- xxxg1009xxx  foci and limited nuclear localization of  xxxg1036xxx 
in irradiated human nsclc cell lines.

50 nmol/l  xxxd2839xxx  or ionizing radiation (ir), cells were returned to 37jc
incubation for 10 days. colonies were fixed for 15 minutes with 70% ethanol
and then stained for 15 minutes with 1%  xxxd2610xxx . after staining,
colonies with at least 50 viable cells were counted with a low-power
microscope. surviving fraction was calculated as (mean colony counts) /
(cells plated)  [plating efficiency (pe)], where pe was defined as (mean
colony counts) / (cells plated for nonirradiated controls). averages and ses
were calculated.
apoptosis assays. apoptosis was measured with annexin- xxxd3027xxx 
iodide staining using the protocol from bd pharmingen (san diego, ca).
briefly,  xxxd1322xxx  and h460 cell lines were treated with 25 nmol/l  xxxd2839xxx  and 3
gy irradiation. twenty-four hours later, cells were suspended, washed twice
with pbs, and adjusted to 106 cells/ml in binding buffer. cell solution (100
al) was transferred to a 5-ml tube and stained with  xxxg166xxx -fitc and
 xxxd3027xxx  iodide for 15 minutes. binding buffer (400 al) was added to the
samples, and the samples were analyzed immediately by flow cytometry.
in separate experiments, cells were assayed for pyknotic nuclei after
staining with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi). near-confluent  xxxd1322xxx  and

by an observer who was blinded to the treatment of each culture. pyknotic
nuclei were recorded, and the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis
were determined from three separate experiments. the mean and se were
calculated for each treatment group.
cell lysis and immunoblot analysis.  xxxd1322xxx  and h460 cell lines were
treated with or without 25 nmol/l  xxxd2839xxx  and incubated for 18 hours. the
cells were then irradiated with 3 gy and incubated for 6 hours. cells were
washed twice with pbs followed by 180 al lysis buffer (20 nmol/l tris,
150 mmol/l nacl, 1 mmol/l edta, 1% triton x-100, 2.5 mmol/l nappi,
1 mmol/l phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 ag/ml leupeptin). protein
concentration was quantified by the bio-rad method (hercules, ca). total
protein (40 ag) was loaded into each well of a 12% sds-page gel and
separated. protein was transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (pvdf)
membrane and probed with antibodies for actin and cleaved caspase-3 (cell
signaling, boston, ma) in a 5% milk tbs-tween 20 (tbst) solution followed
by goat anti-rabbit (sigma, st. louis, mo) in a 0.5% milk tbst solution.
membranes were exposed to film and later developed.
tumor volume study. h460 cells (106) were suspended in 0.1 ml of cell
medium and then injected into the hind limb of mice. tumors were allowed
to form for 1 week. the mice were then divided into one of four groups:
control, ir, 40 mg  xxxd2839xxx , and 40 mg  xxxd2839xxx  plus ir. groups receiving
40 mg  xxxd2839xxx  were treated twice during the 7-day course of ir.  xxxd2839xxx 
and control vehicle were administered via oral gavage. mice were irradiated
1 hour following drug administration with 2 gy (x-ray generator) given as
five fractions, once daily over a total of 7 days. tumor volume measurements were taken every 2 to 3 days for the duration of the study, and the
average and se were calculated. the institutional animal care and use
committee guidelines were followed during all aspects of treatment.
cell immunostaining.  xxxd1322xxx  and h460 cell lines were cultured onto slides
and then treated with 25 nmol/l  xxxd2839xxx  for 18 hours followed by 3 gy. for
 xxxg1036xxx  immunostaining, cells were processed 2 hours after ir; for g- xxxg1009xxx 
immunostaining, cells were processed at the indicated times. cells were
washed with cold pbs and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 5 to 10
minutes and then with 100% methanol. slides were washed with pbs and
incubated with primary antibody to  xxxg1036xxx  (novus biologicals, littleton,
co) or g- xxxg1009xxx  (novus biologicals) at a 1:200 dilution overnight at 4jc
followed by rhodamine red–labeled secondary or alexa fluor 488 secondary
(molecular probes, inc., carlsbad, ca) antibody at a 1:700 dilution. slides
were counterstained with dapi as described above and analyzed by
microscopy. photographs were taken and scanned into adobe photoshop.
positive g- xxxg1009xxx  staining cells were counted by an observer blinded to
treatment conditions, and the mean and se were determined.

h-glycerophosphate, 25% glycerol) was then added to the pellet for
30 minutes. the solution was centrifuged at 13,000  g for 10 minutes,
and the supernatant was collected. protein concentration was then
calculated as stated above. western blot analysis of both cytoplasmic and

 xxxd2839xxx  sensitizes nsclc to the cytotoxic effects of ir.
clonogenic analysis of h460 cell lines was done using  xxxd2839xxx  and
0 to 6 gy. figure 1 shows the mean surviving fraction and se for each
treatment group (n = 3). untreated control cells showed substantial
radioresistance, with 6 gy resulting in only one log reduction in
survival. use of  xxxd2839xxx  1 and 18 hours before ir resulted in a
synergistic decrease in colony survival compared with untreated cells
as evident by an increase in the negative slope of the dose-response
curve. treatment with  xxxd2839xxx  alone for 18 hours resulted in a
significantly reduced pe, whereas treatment for 1 hour alone had no
reduced pe compared with the control. these data show that
 xxxd2839xxx  enhances the cytotoxic effects of ir in nsclc cell lines.
 xxxd2839xxx  enhances radiation-induced apoptosis. to study the
effect of  xxxg1033xxx  inhibition by  xxxd2839xxx  on apoptosis, three in vitro
experiments were done. figure 2 shows results from annexin vfitc/ xxxd3027xxx  iodide flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis. use
of 25 nmol/l  xxxd2839xxx  before 3 gy significantly increased the
number of apoptotic cells from 7% to 30% for  xxxd1322xxx  cell line
(p < 0.001) and from 6% to 25% for h460 cell line (p = 0.003)
compared with control. use of ir alone or  xxxd2839xxx  alone produced
only a minimal increase, and the effect of the combined treatment
was greater than what would be predicted by an additive effect.
to confirm the ability of  xxxd2839xxx  to sensitize human lung cancer
cell lines to radiation-induced apoptosis, nuclear morphology
studies were done. figure 3 shows the mean percentage and se of
pyknotic nuclei determined by dapi staining. use of 25 nmol/l
 xxxd2839xxx  18 hours before 3 gy significantly increased the percentage

before ir increased levels of caspase-3 cleavage in h460 cells. this
increase, however, was not as prominent in the  xxxd1322xxx  cell line.
 xxxd2839xxx  enhances tumor growth delay in vivo. h460 cells
were injected into the hind limb of mice. after tumor formation,
the mice were treated with two oral doses of 40 mg  xxxd2839xxx  and/or
five 2 gy fractions over 7 days. figure 5 shows the fold increase in
tumor volume (fig. 5a) and the tumor growth delay (fig. 5b) for
each treatment group. use of  xxxd2839xxx  alone resulted in a modest
but significant tumor growth delay of 2 days (p < 0.001). ir alone
delayed growth by f4 days (p < 0.001). combined treatment
significantly delayed tumor growth by f20 days (p < 0.001),
indicating that  xxxg1033xxx  inhibition enhances the effects of ir on
nsclc tumor growth. in addition, the mice receiving  xxxd2839xxx 
showed minimal signs of toxicity during the course of the study as
monitored by weight loss and mobility.
 xxxd2839xxx  prolongs the duration of radiation-induced ;- xxxg1009xxx 
foci. immunostaining was done to study g- xxxg1009xxx  foci present at
dna double-strand breaks (dsb). figure 6a shows representative
photographs of the  xxxd1322xxx  cell line treated with combinations of
 xxxd2839xxx  and ir. the green staining of g- xxxg1009xxx  foci is shown. three
grays induced g- xxxg1009xxx  foci as early as 30 minutes following
treatment. these foci disappeared by 6 hours in cell lines treated

www.aacrjournals.org

with ir alone. use of  xxxd2839xxx  alone for 20 hours resulted in a
modest increase in g- xxxg1009xxx  foci. in comparison,  xxxd2839xxx  added
18 hours before ir prolonged the duration of g- xxxg1009xxx  foci for up to
24 hours after ir (42 hours after  xxxd2839xxx  administration).
furthermore, g- xxxg1009xxx  foci were seen at 18 and 24 hours after ir
in cells undergoing apoptosis. interestingly, no g- xxxg1009xxx  foci were
present in cells undergoing apoptosis following treatment with
radiation without  xxxg1033xxx  inhibition. similar results were seen in the
h460 cell line (supplementary fig. s1).
we next studied the rate of g- xxxg1009xxx  foci resolution. figure 6b
shows the number of g- xxxg1009xxx  foci present 24 hours after ir.
treatment with 3 gy alone and  xxxd2839xxx  alone resulted in rapid
resolution of g- xxxg1009xxx  (<5% at 24 hours). use of  xxxd2839xxx  before ir
significantly delayed the resolution of g- xxxg1009xxx  foci with 60%
residual foci in both cell lines at 24 hours (p < 0.001). the increased
duration of g- xxxg1009xxx  foci following treatment with  xxxd2839xxx  and ir
indicates that  xxxg1033xxx  inhibition disrupts the dna repair process,
and this mechanism potentially sensitizes nsclc to the cytotoxic
effects of radiation.
 xxxg1036xxx  nuclear translocation in irradiated lung cancer
cell lines. immunostaining of  xxxg1036xxx  was done on  xxxd1322xxx  and

compartmentalization. figure 7 shows representative photographs
of the h460 cell line probed with anti- xxxg1036xxx  antibodies and
rhodamine-labeled secondary antibodies (red) and then counterstained with dapi (blue). untreated cells and cells treated with
 xxxd2839xxx  alone showed background  xxxg1036xxx  staining in the cytoplasm
and nucleus. when h460 cells were treated with 3 gy,  xxxg1036xxx 
localized to the nucleus at 2 hours and minimal  xxxg1036xxx  was present in the cytoplasm. however,  xxxd2839xxx  added before ir markedly
limited  xxxg1036xxx  nuclear localization. a similar effect was seen in the
 xxxd1322xxx  cell line (supplementary fig. s2). these results were confirmed
in the h460 cell line using anti- xxxg1036xxx  antibodies for western blot
analysis of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins (fig. 7b).

discussion
previous studies have shown radiosensitization with  xxxg1033xxx 
inhibitors in several cell lines, including melanoma (17), squamous
(18), prostate (24), and colon carcinoma (14–17). in the current
study, this radiosensitizing effect was shown in nsclc cell lines in
clonogenic studies. interestingly, an effect was seen when  xxxd2839xxx 
was administered 1 hour before ir. although this enhancement
was less than that of drug administered for 18 hours before ir, it is
possible that the effects of  xxxd2839xxx  are in part due to a mechanism

that does not require epigenetic changes. the biological effects of
 xxxg1033xxx  inhibitors were once focused on alteration of gene
transcription through histone modification. recently, many transcription-independent pathways affected by  xxxg1033xxx  inhibitors have
been identified. these pathways include histone-dependent
processes, such as dna repair (17, 24, 25) and cell cycle regulation
(26–28), and histone-independent processes, such as activation of
protein kinases, including akt and extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (23).
 xxxg1033xxx  inhibition has been shown to induce apoptosis by
affecting several pathways. apoptotic genes activated by  xxxg1033xxx 
inhibitors include bak, bax, p53, caspase-9,  xxxg342xxx , caspase-3,
bid, bad , etc. antiapoptotic genes repressed by  xxxg1033xxx  inhibitors
include bcl-2,  xxxg436xxx , survivin, nf-jb, etc. (7, 13). the essential
pathways for apoptosis induction continue to remain under debate;
however, p21waf1 has been implicated to play an important role in
certain tumor cell lines (29–31). in this study, low doses of  xxxd2839xxx 
had synergy with ir in inducing apoptosis as evident by annexinpropidium iodide flow cytometry and nuclear morphology. these
data suggest that apoptosis is one mechanism of interaction
between  xxxd2839xxx  and ir.
the effect of  xxxd2839xxx  on tumor growth was studied in vivo using
human lung cancer xenografts in the nude mouse model. in this

 xxxd2839xxx  sensitizes lung cancer to radiation

study, mice receiving two oral doses of  xxxd2839xxx  and five 2 gy
fractions over 7 days showed significant delay in tumor growth
compared with either agent alone. drug (40 mg/kg) was
administered 1 hour before irradiation on days 1 and 4 of the
study. the relatively high dose and f17 hour half-life (21) allowed
for the drug to be theoretically available 1 to 2 days after
administration. the mice receiving the drug exhibited few signs of
toxicity. in the current experiment, there were no premature deaths
and the mice in all groups had similar weights throughout the
study.  xxxg1033xxx  inhibitors are believed to be effective in enhancing
both radiation and chemotherapy treatments while being safe for
patients. phase i clinical data from  xxxd2839xxx  showed minimal and
tolerable side effects (21). because of its potential as an anticancer
agent and its low side effect profile, this class of pharmaceutical is
promising for future cancer therapy.
phosphorylation of  xxxg1009xxx  (g- xxxg1009xxx ) is an evolutionarily conserved response to dna dsbs (32–35). the formation of g- xxxg1009xxx  is
necessary for the recruitment of many factors involved in dna
repair, including nbs1 (mrn complex) and 53bp1, both of which
regulate cell cycle checkpoints (36). dna dsbs induced by ir
activate checkpoint pathways that inhibit progression of cells
through g1 and g2 phases and delay the progression through s
phase (36–38). previous reports have shown the ability of  xxxg1033xxx 
inhibitors to prolong the duration of g- xxxg1009xxx  in irradiated
melanoma (17) and prostate (24) cell lines. both of these reports
attribute the radiosensitization ability of  xxxg1033xxx  inhibitors to the
inhibition of dna repair. the mechanisms behind the inhibition of
dna repair by  xxxg1033xxx  inhibitors are not clear. previous reports have
shown that altered gene expression of atm (39), dna-pkcs (40),
ku70 (41), and  xxxg2434xxx  (42) leads to radiosensitization. furthermore,
mutations of acetylatable lysine residues on  xxxg1052xxx  have been
shown to increase the effect of dna-damaging agents (43). a recent
study by tamburini and tyler (44) showed that dynamic changes in
histone acetylation accompany homologous recombination and the
modulation of histone acetylation is necessary for cell viability. in
addition, kusch et al. (45) have shown that loss of the dtip60

complex increases the duration of g- xxxg1009xxx  homologues following
ir. the mechanism of  xxxg1033xxx  inhibitors on dna repair inhibition is
potentially multifactorial, involving both transcriptional regulation
of dna repair genes and direct effects on the acetylation of repair
complexes.
the importance of histone acetylation and deacetylation in dna
repair is emerging (46). kao et al. have shown that ir induces
 xxxg1036xxx  foci formation in the nucleus and conclude that  xxxg1036xxx 
interacts with 53bp1 to mediate the response to dna damage (47).
in the present study,  xxxg1036xxx  translocated to the nucleus in
response to ir.  xxxd2839xxx  added before ir limited this radiationinduced nuclear localization. inhibiting hdacs blocks the nuclear
localization of complexes important in dna repair, including
 xxxg1036xxx  and possibly 53bp1. dna repair is also attenuated, and the
cell is more susceptible to ir-induced apoptosis. many proteins in
addition to  xxxg1036xxx  and 53bp1 have been shown to form nuclear
foci following dna damage, including brca1 (48), rad51, and the
nsb1/mre11/ xxxg1922xxx  complex (49, 50). the effect of  xxxg1033xxx 
inhibitors on the localization and function of these complexes
would provide further insight into the role of  xxxg1033xxx  in dna repair.
in this study,  xxxd2839xxx  was shown to sensitize nsclc to the
cytotoxic effects of ir. furthermore, this compound was shown to be
effective with oral administration in animal models. the ic50 in the
nanomolar range for  xxxd2839xxx , along with the relatively long half-life
and low toxicity, makes this compound promising for future clinical
trials. the tumor-selective effect of  xxxg1033xxx  inhibitors indicates that
these drugs are exciting candidates for cancer therapy.
