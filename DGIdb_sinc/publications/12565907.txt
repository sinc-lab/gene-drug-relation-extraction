abstract
human epidermal melanocytes hold the full capacity for autocrine de novo synthesis/regulation/recycling of the essential cofactor 6-tetrahydrobiopterin (6bh4 ) for conversion of l -phenylalanine via  xxxg1660xxx  to l -tyrosine and for production of l -dopa via  xxxg2276xxx  to initiate both pigmentation and catecholamine synthesis in these neural crest-derived
cells. earlier we have demonstrated pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase (pcd) mrna and enzyme activities in epidermal melanocytes and keratinocytes. this protein dimerises also the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (hnf-1), leading to
activation of multiple genes. this study demonstrates for the ﬁrst time  xxxg1676xxx / xxxg1064xxx  expression and transcriptional activity in
human epidermal melanocytes in vitro and in situ and identiﬁed tyrosinase, the key enzyme for pigmentation, as a new transcriptional target. speciﬁc binding of  xxxg1676xxx /hnf-1 complex to the human tyrosinase promoter was conﬁrmed by gel shift analysis.
these results provide a novel mechanism in the regulation of skin pigmentation.

the presence of an autocrine 6bh4 de novo synthesis/
recycling/regulation has been shown in keratinocytes
and melanocytes under in vitro conditions as well as in
human epidermal cell extracts from suction blister tissue
[2]. in fact, cofactor levels and cytosolic enzyme activities increase with increasing skin colour (photo skin
types i–vi, fitzpatrick classiﬁcation) [2,3]. in addition
epidermal 6bh4 levels and enzymes for de novo synthesis and recycling of the cofactor are upregulated
upon uv exposure [4]. in this context an increase of
melanocyte-derived  xxxg1660xxx  (pah,
 xxxg1660xxx ) activity was documented, underlining the

the essential amino acid l -phenylalanine to initiate de
novo melanogenesis [5,6].
pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase (pcd, ec
4.2.1.96) catalyses the dehydration of 4a-oh-tetrahydrobiopterin (4a-oh-bh4 ) to quinonoid dihydrobiopterin (qbh2 ), which is converted to 6bh4 by
dihydropterin reductase (ec 1.6.99.7) in the presence of
nadh [1]. pcd is rate limiting in the recycling/regeneration of 6bh4 which is the essential cofactor for the
turnover of the amino acids l -phenylalanine, l -tyrosine,
and l -tryptophan via  xxxg1660xxx ,  xxxg2276xxx  (th,  xxxg2276xxx ), and tryptophan
hydroxylase ( xxxg2315xxx ,  xxxg2315xxx ), respectively. previously it was recognised that impaired pcd activity leads
to the accumulation of 4a-oh-bh4 , which in turn
isomerises to (7r)-l - xxxd2033xxx -5,6,7,8,-tetrahydrobiopterin (7bh4 ) [7,8]. this 7-isomer can eﬀectively inhibit
pah with a ki ¼ 106 m [9]. it has been recognised that
pcd is tightly coupled to pah, increasing the reaction
rate of this enzyme 7-fold [10,11]. pcd dissociates into a

dimer, which is also known as  xxxg1676xxx  (dimerisation
cofactor of hepatocyte nuclear factor-1/hnf-1) [12,13].
the 3d structure of pcd/ xxxg1676xxx  has been solved in two
laboratories independently showing the formation of a
tetramer of identical subunits with 222 symmetry
[14,15]. the bi-functional nature of this protein was
discovered accidentally and it was shown that the sequence of pcd contained the dimerisation cofactor for
the transcription factor hnf-1 [12,13].
 xxxg1676xxx  has the 3d structure of a macro-molecular
saddle similar to tata box binding protein (tbt) [16].
based on the initial analysis of 11 genes regulated by
hnf-1 two consensus sequences for the binding of
 xxxg1676xxx /hnf-1 have been constructed, yielding a 13 bp
inverted palindrome or an overlapping 16 base sequence
[17,18]. each consensus contained an inverted repeat,
indicating that  xxxg1676xxx /hnf-1 binds as a dimer of homodimers to its promoter-binding domain [19]. earlier
the presence of pcd mrna as well as protein expression and cytosolic enzyme activities have been documented in human epidermal keratinocytes and
melanocytes [2,20]. however, so far it was unknown,
whether epidermal pcd besides its enzymatic activity in
6bh4 recycling also exercises dimerising function as
 xxxg1676xxx  together with its transcription factor hnf-1.
hnf-1 (a and b), hnf-3 (a; b, and c), hnf-4 (a and
c), and hnf-6 belong to a homeopathic family designated as hepatocyte nuclear factor family [21–24]. it has
been shown that diﬀerent isoforms regulate various
genes in the liver, thymus, and intestine [21]. to our
knowledge the presence of hnf-1 in the human epidermis has not been documented so far. in the study
presented herein, we therefore asked the question,
whether epidermal melanocytes hold  xxxg1676xxx /hnf-1
transcriptional activity. since tyrosinase ( xxxg2367xxx )
is a melanocyte speciﬁc enzyme, we used computer
analysis to compare the sequence homology of the
promoter region for human tyrosinase as documented
by takeda et al. [25] with the sequence of the  xxxg1676xxx /
hnf-1 binding domain. the result was the discovery of
a single putative  xxxg1676xxx /hnf-1 binding domain 184
bases away from the tata box. this analysis was
based on the hnf-1 binding domain constructed from
26 genes [26]. these initial data suggested  xxxg1676xxx / xxxg1064xxx  functionality for transcription of the tyrosinase gene.
based on the isolation of a 439 bp fragment of the
human tyrosinase promoter containing the putative
 xxxg1676xxx /hnf-1 homodimer consensus sequence, speciﬁc
binding for  xxxg1676xxx /hnf-1 was conﬁrmed using gel shift
analysis, thus uncovering  xxxg1676xxx /hnf-1 transcription
of the tyrosinase gene in human melanocytes. this result
is in agreement with the computer modelled minimised
3d structure of the inverted palindrome established as
the  xxxg1676xxx /hnf-1 binding domain [17,18]. moreover,
we provide evidence for the ﬁrst time for speciﬁc  xxxg1676xxx /
 xxxg1064xxx  protein expression in human epidermal mela-

the samples were embedded into o.c.t. compound (sakura,
eastbourne, uk), immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and
stored at )80 °c until further use. sections were cut in 5 lm thickness
and placed on poly-l -lysine coated glass slides (sigma diagnostics, st.
louis, usa). this study was approved by the local ethics committee.
cell cultures. human melanocytes were established in mcdb 153
serum free medium from facelift, breast reduction or foreskin from
healthy subjects according to the method of pittelkow and shipley [27].
for immunohistochemical studies primary melanocytes were seeded on
chamber slides (nalge nunc, naperville, usa) and cultured for 48 h
before staining.
in situ and in vitro immunoﬂuorescence studies of epidermal melanocytes. cryo cut sections (5 lm) of normal human full skin biopsies
were used unﬁxed. primary cultured human melanocytes (passage 2–4)
were ﬁxed for 15 min at rt in 5% paraformaldehyde in pbs and
blocked with 10% normal donkey serum (nds). the anti-pcd antibody (dilution 1:150; provided by b. th€
ony, z€
urich, switzerland) was
diluted in 1% nds and sections or cells were incubated overnight at
4 °c. subsequently, sections or cells were incubated for 1 h at rt with
a fitc-labelled anti-rabbit antibody raised in donkey (dilution 1:100;
jackson immunoresearch laboratories, pennsylvania, usa).  xxxg1064xxx 
was detected by repeating the blocking and incubation for 90 min at
rt with a goat anti- xxxg1064xxx  antibody (sc-6547, dilution 1:50; santa
cruz biotechnology, usa). a tritc-labelled anti-goat antibody was
utilised to detect  xxxg1064xxx . since melanocytes express the speciﬁc  xxxg1784xxx 
protein, we used mouse anti- xxxg1784xxx  for detection of these cells (nki/
beteb, dilution 1:20; monosan, caltag med syst, uk). immunoreactivity was viewed and captured using a leica dm-irb inverted microscope coupled to a digital camera together with neotech ‘‘image
grabber pci’’ imaging software.
western blot analysis for hnf-1. normal human melanocytes
(passage 4) were harvested in the presence of a protease inhibitor
cocktail (sigma, poole, uk) at a concentration recommended by the
manufacturer. cells were lysed by performing a freezing–thawing cycle
six times. the cell lysate was centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 rpm for 15 min and
the supernatant was separated in 10% sds–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. protein bands were transferred to a pvdf membrane
(immobilon-p, millipore, bedford, uk). the membrane was blocked
with 0.3% gelatine in natt-buﬀer (150 mm nacl, 20 mm tris, and
0.047% tween, ph 7.4) and incubated overnight at 4 °c with goat antihnf-1a antibody (sc-6547, 1:600, santa cruz biotechnology, usa).
the blot was washed and incubated for 1 h at rt with an anti-goat
igg peroxidase-conjugated antibody (fc speciﬁc, 1:3000; sigma–
aldrich, st. louis, usa). visualisation of the  xxxg1064xxx  band was
performed using a modiﬁed enhanced chemiluminescence (ecl) ﬁxed
on a ﬁlm sheet (x-omat kodak, usa).
isolation, puriﬁcation, and sequencing of the tyrosinase promoter
region containing the hnf-1 binding domain. a 439 bp fragment of the
human tyrosinase promoter containing the hnf-1 binding domain
was isolated from whole blood cdna from three healthy subjects
using the primers: 50 -atggtctctgagaaataactac-30 and 50 atctgtgactccaattagccag-30 . all primers were designed
based on cdna sequences. rt-pcr conditions were 35 cycles, 1 min
each at 94 °c, 55 °c, and 72 °c. rt-pcr products were separated on
1.5% agarose gel and detected with ethidium bromide. bands were
eluted, cleaned, and sequenced. the puriﬁed fragments were stored at

puriﬁcation of recombinant hnf-1 and  xxxg1676xxx . the pt 7/7 vector
for his-tagged truncated hnf-1 containing both the  xxxg1676xxx  dimerisation domain and the dna binding sequence as well as the pacy9d
vector for  xxxg1676xxx  were cloned into epicurian coli bl21 (de3) and
protein induction was achieved with 103 m isopropylthio-b-d -galactoside (iptg) following the method of ficner et al. [15]. five milligram of crude cell extract protein was applied to 100 ll of talon metal
aﬃnity resin equilibrated with 102 m tris–hcl buﬀer (ph 8.0) containing 5  102 m nah2 po4 and 8 m urea. the bound proteins were
washed with 2 ml buﬀer and both the his-tagged truncated hnf-1 and
 xxxg1676xxx  were eluted with 300 ll of 0.1 m edta. crude extracts from
before/after induction with iptg and puriﬁed truncated hnf-1 and
 xxxg1676xxx  were separated on 15% sds–polyacrylamide gels followed by
staining with 0.1% coomassie blue.
gel shift assay for the identiﬁcation of hnf-1/ xxxg1676xxx  binding to the

results
in situ and in vitro identiﬁcation of  xxxg1676xxx / xxxg1064xxx 
expression in melanocytes of the human epidermis
the expression of pcd mrna and enzyme activities
in human melanocytes has been reported earlier [2,20].
however, to our knowledge the activity of this bifunctional protein together with its transcription factor
hnf-1 has never been demonstrated in these cells.
therefore we asked the question whether epidermal
melanocytes express  xxxg1676xxx / xxxg1064xxx  utilising a speciﬁc
antibody against the  xxxg1064xxx  isomer. initially we employed single and double immunoﬂuorescence labelling
techniques utilising speciﬁc anti-pcd, anti- xxxg1064xxx ,
and the melanocyte lineated anti- xxxg1784xxx  antibodies. pcd
and  xxxg1784xxx  colocalisation conﬁrmed the presence of pcd
in epidermal melanocytes in situ (figs. 1a–c). in order
to follow possible  xxxg1676xxx  activity of pcd we examined
the sections for its transcription factor  xxxg1064xxx . the
presence of  xxxg1064xxx  was demonstrated in situ
throughout the entire epidermis, but also in the  xxxg1784xxx 
positive melanocytes (figs. 1d–f). next we evaluated
the cellular localisation of pcd,  xxxg1064xxx , and  xxxg1676xxx /
 xxxg1064xxx  in more detail, utilising human primary melanocyte cell cultures. examination of the immunoreactivity using single immunoﬂuorescence labelling of pcd
(fig. 1g) and  xxxg1064xxx  (fig. 1h) revealed the presence

of cytosolic as well as nuclear positivity. however, colocalisation of  xxxg1676xxx / xxxg1064xxx  occurred only in some
nuclei, supporting transcriptional activity in these cells.
some nuclei (arrow) showed only  xxxg1064xxx  protein expression without the presence of  xxxg1676xxx  (fig. 1i). these
initial in situ and in vitro results supported the presence
of  xxxg1676xxx / xxxg1064xxx  transcriptional activity in distinct
human epidermal melanocytes.
conﬁrmation of  xxxg1064xxx  protein expression in epidermal
melanocytes
based on the immunoﬂuorescence analysis, we next
used western blotting to conﬁrm the presence of the
 xxxg1064xxx  isoform in cell extracts of human epidermal
melanocytes (fig. 2). two bands at 67 and 75 kda were
identiﬁed. this result is in agreement with the speciﬁcity
of the  xxxg1064xxx  antibody, raised against a c-terminal
epitope of  xxxg1064xxx  according to the datasheet (santa
cruz biotechnology, usa). the third band at 49 kda
suggests another fragment of  xxxg1064xxx  in melanocytes
under in vitro conditions.
hnf-1 binding consensus is present on the tyrosinase
promoter
based on the above results that  xxxg1676xxx / xxxg1064xxx  protein is expressed in melanocytes, we examined tyrosinase
as a potential target gene in these pigment cells. a computer sequence analysis of the promoter region of human
tyrosinase established by takeda et al. identiﬁed a single
putative  xxxg1676xxx /hnf-1 binding domain 184 bases away
from the tata box utilising the hnf-1 consensus domain constructed from the analysis of 26 genes [25,26]. a
comparison of this computer delineated binding site on
human tyrosinase with the hnf-1 consensus revealed
87% sequence homology (figs. 3a and b).
successful isolation of the tyrosinase promoter containing
the putative  xxxg1676xxx /hnf-1 binding site
in order to concur  xxxg1676xxx /hnf-1 transcriptional
activity, a 439 bp fragment of the human tyrosinase
promoter containing the putative  xxxg1676xxx /hnf-1 binding domain was obtained from genomic dna of three
healthy individuals using rt-pcr (fig. 4).
the pcr transcripts and their authenticity were
conﬁrmed by sequence analysis. there were no diﬀerences in the sequence of this fragment for the three
subjects tested.
isolation and puriﬁcation of recombinant hnf-1 and
pcd protein
we next transfected e. coli bl21 (de3) with the pt
7/7 vector for a truncated hnf-1 and the pacyc9d

overexpressed and puriﬁed from the crude bacterial cell
extracts by talon metal aﬃnity chromatography as
described in methods. the overexpression of hnf-1
and pcd transfected together in e. coli bl21 (de3)
cells was separated by sds–polyacrylamide electrophoresis. the result is demonstrated in fig. 5. the
truncated his-tagged hnf-1 yielded a minimum molecular weight of 37 kda. his-tagged pcd had the size
of 14 kda.

 xxxg1064xxx  fragment by this antibody.

gel shift analysis using the isolated tetrameric  xxxg1064xxx / xxxg1676xxx  complex and the 439 bp tyrosinase promoter
dna proved speciﬁc binding of the dimerised transcription factor to the tyrosinase promoter (fig. 6). this
result supports  xxxg1676xxx /hnf-1 transcription of human
tyrosinase.

the computer model of the minimised 3d structure
of the tyrosinase promoter yields an inverted palindrome for the  xxxg1676xxx /hnf-1 consensus, showing four
h-bonded base pairs in the consensus loop. the base
pairs are a–t, t–a, t–a, and g–c. this result is in
agreement with the established inverted palindrome for
 xxxg1676xxx /hnf-1 binding [17,18,22] (fig. 7).

documented. in this report we demonstrate for the ﬁrst
time  xxxg1676xxx / xxxg1064xxx  transcription in human melanocytes identifying tyrosinase, the key enzyme for the initiation of melanin biosynthesis, as a new transcriptional
target for hnf-1. moreover, the results of this study
revealed the presence of the  xxxg1064xxx  isoform of this
speciﬁc homeoprotein family in human melanocytes
using immunolabelling and western blot analysis.
the discovery of  xxxg1676xxx / xxxg1064xxx  transcriptional activity in epidermal melanocytes opens a new window to
investigate other genes activated by hnf-1 in these
cells. however, the control of both pah and tyrosinase
in melanocytes by this transcription factor is novel and
oﬀers a new view in our understanding of the regulation
of skin pigmentation.

tion, and recycling [2]. here it should be noted that
both, melanin—as well as catecholamine biosynthesis in
these cells, are under tight regulation by this cofactor,
because 6bh4 controls the l -tyrosine supply from
l -phenylalanine via pah enzyme activity for both
pathways. moreover, 6bh4 controls the initiation of
pigmentation and catecholamine synthesis via tyrosine
hydroxylase [28]. in addition allosteric inhibition of
tyrosinase by 6bh4 has been documented [29]. in this
context it has been recognised that pah enzyme activity
is stimulated 7-fold by pcd [10]. this bi-functional
protein exercises its second function as dimerisation
cofactor for hnf-1 [12,13]. it has also been shown that
the murine pah gene in hnf-1= animals is completely silent due to an inactive chromatin structure of
this gene [30]. taken together, these results support the
fact that pah activity is controlled at the enzyme level
by pcd [10], whereas  xxxg1676xxx /hnf-1 controls the regulation of this gene [31]. here it is interesting that epidermal pah enzyme activities increase linearly from fair
to dark skin (photo skin typesi–vi) and that these activities are stimulated by uv exposure [4]. these data
support the induction of pah transcription in genetically determined skin colour as well as de novo melanin
biosynthesis [4]. however, the transcription of pah by
 xxxg1676xxx / xxxg1064xxx  in the human skin has not yet been
