summary
1 we have investigated the actions of the a1d-adrenoceptor selective antagonist bmy 7378
in comparison with yohimbine at a1- and a2-adrenoceptors.
2 in rat aorta (a1d-adrenoceptor), bmy 7378 (pa2 of 8.67) was about 100 times more
potent than yohimbine (pa2 of 6.62) at antagonizing the contractile response to noradrenaline.
3 in human saphenous vein (a2c-adrenoceptor), bmy 7378 (pa2 of 6.48) was approximately
10 times less potent than yohimbine (pa2 of 7.56) at antagonizing the contractile response to
noradrenaline.
4 in prostatic portions of rat vas deferens, bmy 7378 (10 lm) did not significantly affect the
concentration-dependent inhibition of single pulse nerve stimulation-evoked contractions by
xylazine (an action at prejunctional a2d-adrenoceptors).
5 in ligand-binding studies, bmy 7378 showed 10-fold selectivity for a2c-adrenoceptors
(pki of 6.54) over other a2-adrenoceptors.
6 it is concluded that bmy 7378, in addition to a1d-adrenoceptor selectivity in terms of
a1-adrenoceptors, shows selectivity for a2c-adrenoceptors in terms of a2-adrenoceptors.

introduction

a2-adrenoceptors have been subdivided into three
subtypes, a2a-, a2b- and a2c-adrenoceptors, based
on ligand-binding and molecular cloning studies
(lorenz et al., 1990; bylund, 1992), and the rat
a2d-adrenoceptor is a species orthologue of the
human a2a-adrenoceptor (harrison, pearson &
lynch, 1991; lanier, downing, duzie & homey,
1991; docherty, 1998; guimares & moura, 2001).
the a2a/d-adrenoceptor is the major prejunctional
a2-adrenoceptor present prejunctionally on noradrenergic nerve terminals (hein, altmann & kobilka,
1999). contractions of the human saphenous vein
to noradrenaline involve a2-adrenoceptors of the
a2c-subtype (gavin, colgan, moore, shanik &
docherty, 1997; rizzo et al., 2001; giessler,
wangemann, silber, dhein & brodde, 2002), and
a2c-adrenoceptors also mediate contractions in
cutaneous arteries (chotani, flavahan, mitra,
daunt & flavahan, 2000).
a1-adrenoceptors were initially subdivided into
a1a- and a1b-subtypes in ligand-binding studies,
based on the affinities of a series of ligands,
especially wb 4101 and  xxxd3000xxx  (morrow &
creese, 1986). molecular cloning techniques initi-

ally revealed four subtypes of a1-adrenoceptor: a1a,
a1b, a1c, a1d (cotecchia et al., 1988; schwinn et al.,
1990; lomasney et al., 1991; perez, piascik &
graham, 1991; bylund et al., 1994). however, it is
now clear that the a1a/a1d clone represents a third
subtype of a1-adrenoceptor (a1d), whereas the a1c
is now identified with the a1a-ligand-binding site.
these clones have now been renamed to match the
functional receptors: a1a (formerly a1c), a1b (formerly a1b), and a1d (formerly a1a/a1d) (see docherty, 1998; guimares & moura, 2001).
bmy 7378 is an a1d-adrenoceptor selective
antagonist (goetz et al., 1995) used in many
studies to identify receptors involved in agonist or
nerve-evoked contractions. bmy 7378 has high
potency as an antagonist in rat aorta, but low
potency in vas deferens (piascik et al., 1995; deng,
chemtob & varma, 1996). as a result, contractions to noradrenaline in rat aorta have been
identified as involving mainly a1d-adrenoceptors.
however, in studies of the actions of bmy 7378,
we obtained results which led us to suggest that this
agent may also act as an a2-adrenoceptor antagonist. the effects of bmy 7378 in comparison with
yohimbine at a2-adrenoceptors were examined in
ligand-binding studies, and functionally in human

saphenous vein and rat vas deferens. a2-adrenoceptor potency of bmy 7378 in human saphenous
vein was compared with a1d-adrenoceptor potency
in rat aorta.

methods
rat aorta
following stunning and exsanguination of male
wistar rats (weight range, 250–350 g), aortic rings
of 3–5 mm in length were attached to myograph
transducers under 1 g tension in organ baths at
37 °c in krebs–henseleit solution of the following
composition: (mm): naci 119; nahco3 25;
d-glucose 11.1; kcl 4.7; cacl2 2.5; kh2po4 1.2;
 xxxd2534xxx  1.0;  xxxd228xxx  0.28; edta 0.03.
additionally, cocaine (3 lm), propranolol (1 lm)
and indomethacin (10 lm) were present, to block
noradrenaline re-uptake, beta-adrenoceptors and
prostaglandin synthesis respectively. tissues were
contracted with noradrenaline (10 lm), and
washed. bathing fluid was then changed every
15 min for the next hour. tissues were then
contracted with cumulative concentrations of noradrenaline in 0.5 log unit increments, beginning
with 1 nm until a maximum was reached. tissues
were then washed for 1 hr, changing the bathing
fluid every 15 min. after a further 1 h exposure to
vehicle or antagonist, cumulative concentrations of
noradrenaline were added until a maximum was
reached. tissues were discarded if the potency
(pd2, )log m) of noradrenaline in the first concentration–response curve was <7.0.
rat vas deferens

ó 2005
blackwell publishing ltd

prostatic portions of vas deferens from male
wistar rats were obtained. tissues were attached
to myograph transducers under 1 g tension in
organ baths at 37 °c in krebs–henseleit solution
of the same composition as for aorta, except that
cocaine, propranolol and indomethacin were
absent. tissues were placed between platinum
electrodes and stimulated every 5 min with a
single stimulus (0.5 ms pulses, supramaximal pulses) to produce isometric contractions. xylazine
or vehicle was added cumulatively in 0.5 log unit
increments at 5-min intervals. an isometric twitch
was obtained following 5 min exposure to each
xylazine concentration, or following exposure to
the vehicle. distilled water vehicle did not significantly affect stimulation-evoked contractions.
bmy 7378 (10 lm) or vehicle was present for
30 min before beginning cumulative additions of
xylazine.
the studies were carried out in accordance with
the declaration of helsinki and have been
approved by the department of health and by
the rcsi research ethics committee.

human saphenous vein
human saphenous veins were obtained from
patients (aged 32–79 years), predominantly female,
undergoing surgical removal of varicose veins.
patients gave informed consent for tissue removed
in varicose vein surgery to be used for research.
specimens of long saphenous vein were collected
and immediately transferred to a container with
krebs–henseleit solution and transferred at 5 °c to
the laboratory within approximately 1–2 h. the
veins were examined macroscopically and apparently healthy segments of side branches were cut
into rings of approximately 3–4 mm length. rings
were attached to fixed rods and to myograph
transducers under 1 g tension in organ baths at
37 °c in krebs–henseleit solution of the same
composition as above. additionally, corticosterone
(30 lm) was present. experiments were carried out
as described for rat aorta. tissues were discarded if
the potency (pd2, )log m) of noradrenaline in the
first concentration–response curve was <6.0. as not
all experiments had a viable vehicle experiment,
effects of test drug were corrected for the mean
shift occurring in vehicle experiments (shift of
0.31 log units to left).
radioligand-binding studies
preparation of rat kidney membranes was carried
out as described by connaughton & docherty
(1990a), and preparation of rat submandibular
gland membranes was as described for rat kidney.
membranes of sf9 cells expressing human recombinant a2c-adrenoceptors were purchased from
research biochemicals. the resultant pellets were
used immediately or stored at )20 °c for later use.
pellets were reconstituted in 5 volumes (submandibular), 10 volumes (kidney) or 25 volumes (sf9
cells) of incubation buffer.
in saturation experiments, aliquots of membrane suspension were incubated with various
concentrations of [3h]-yohimbine (specific activity:
81 ci mmol)1, amersham, little chalfont, uk) at
25 °c (rat kidney: 0.5–30 nm; sf9 cells: 0.2–20 nm;
rat submandibular gland: 1.0–40 nm; incubation
buffer: tris–hcl 50 mm, edta 5 mm, ph 7.4 at
25 °c). in competition studies, [3h]-yohimbine (5
or 10 nm) was incubated with competing ligands in
concentrations from 0.1 nm to 1 mm in 0.5 log
unit increments for 30 min. non-specific binding
was determined in the presence of  xxxd2914xxx 
(10 lm). specific binding of [3h]-yohimbine was
70–90% of total binding at the concentration used
in displacement experiments. assays were terminated by washing with ice-cold incubation buffer,
followed by rapid vacuum filtration through whatman gf/c filters, using a brandel cell harvester.
radioactivity retained on filters was determined by
liquid scintillation spectroscopy.

bmy 7378 and a 2 c -adrenoceptors

the inhibition constant (ki) for inhibition of
radiolabelled ligand binding was determined from
the formula:
ic50
ð1 þ ½3 h=kd þ

;

where ic50 is the concentration of competing ligand
that inhibits radioligand-specific binding by 50%,
kd is the dissociation constant for the radioligand
yohimbine (rat kidney: 8.80 ± 0.62 nm, n ¼ 7;
human recombinant a2c-adrenoceptors: 8.7 ±
3.5 nm, n ¼ 3; rat submandibular gland: 23.7 ±
2.0 nm, n ¼ 4), and [3h] is the concentration of
tritiated yohimbine (5 nm: rat kidney; 10 nm: sf9
cells and rat submandibular gland).
drugs
the following drugs were used: bmy 7378
(8-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-8azaspiro[4,5]decane-7, 9-dione dihydrochloride;
tocris, avonmouth, uk);  xxxd1736xxx 
(sigma, dublin, ireland); corticosterone (sigma);
indomethacin (sigma); noradrenaline bitartrate
(sigma); propranolol hydrocholoride (sigma); xylazine hydrochloride (sigma); yohimbine hydrochloride (sigma). drugs were dissolved in distilled
water, except for corticosterone and indomethacin
(100% ethanol: maximum bath concentration,
0.1%). drugs were diluted in distilled water.
statistics
values are mean ± sem from n experiments.
agonist pd2 ()log ec50) or pic50 values pre- and
post-vehicle or antagonist were compared by analysis of variance and tukey’s or dunnett’s posttest. statistical and graphical analysis was carried
out using instat for macintosh and graphpad prism
for pc (graphpad software, san diego, ca, usa).

6.39 ± 0.05, and maximum contractions of
1.27 ± 0.17 g (n ¼ 20). in vehicle experiments,
potency of noradrenaline (pd2) was shifted from
6.32 ± 0.06 to 6.63 ± 0.13 (n ¼ 10), between the
first and second concentration–response curves
(a shift of 0.31 log units to the left). test responses
to antagonists were corrected for this change.
bmy 7378 and yohimbine produced concentration-dependent shifts of noradrenaline concentration–response curves which were approximately
parallel with no evidence for a resistant component
of the agonist-evoked contraction. schild plots
were constructed for the antagonists bmy 7378
and yohimbine against noradrenaline to obtain pa2
values and slopes of the schild plots (fig. 2;
table 1). for both, a schild plot with slope not
significantly different from )1 could be obtained.
bmy 7378 was approximately 10 times less potent
than yohimbine at inhibiting noradrenaline-evoked
contractions of human saphenous vein.

rat vas deferens
in prostatic portions of rat vas deferens, the
magnitude of twitch to a single electrical stimulus
was 1.36 ± 0.30 g (n ¼ 7). xylazine (0.01–1 lm)
produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of
the stimulation-evoked contraction, but there was
no difference between responses in the presence of
vehicle and in the presence of bmy 7378 (10 lm)
(fig. 3).
ligand-binding studies
table 2 shows the affinities of the two antagonists
for a2b-, a2c- and a2d-adrenoceptor ligand-binding
sites. yohimbine shows three-fold selectivity for
a2b- or a2c-adrenoceptors over a2d-adrenoceptors
(table 2). bmy 7378 showed approximately
10-fold selectivity for a2c-adrenoceptors, and had
approximately 30 times lower affinity than yohimbine for this receptor (table 2).

discussion
bmy 7378 is a selective a1d-adrenoceptor antagonist which has become virtually a diagnostic tool
for identifying these receptors functionally. it has
been used to indentify a1d-adrenoceptors in

contractions of rat aorta and in pressor responses
in the pithed rat (goetz et al., 1995; zhou &
vargas, 1996; villalobos et al., 1999). our studies
suggest other actions of bmy 7378 as discussed
below.
in ligand-binding studies, bmy 7378 showed
selectivity for a2c-adrenoceptors, being about 30
times less potent than yohimbine at these receptors.
its affinities at a2b- and a2d-adrenoceptors were
about 10 times lower than at a2c-adrenoceptors.
hence, bmy 7378 has significant affinity for a2cadrenoceptors which might interfere with its usefulness as an a1d-adrenoceptor antagonist. we
chose the contractile response of rat aorta to
noradrenaline as a functional assay of the a1dadrenoceptor subtype. the pa2 of bmy 7378 in
rat aorta was 8.67, close to its reported affinity for
a1d-adrenoceptor ligand-binding sites (average of
8.78, see honner & docherty, 1999). bmy 7378
was about 100 times more potent than yohimbine
in rat aorta. although the slope of the schild plot
for bmy 7378 against contractions to noradrenaline was )0.79, this was not significantly different
from negative unity and was probably due simply
to the variability between experiments. the evidence is that the receptors in rat aorta are mainly of
the a1d-adrenoceptor subtype (piascik et al.,
1995).
having established the relative potencies of
bmy 7378 and yohimbine at functional a1dadrenoceptors and at a2c-adrenoceptor ligandbinding sites, we chose to investigate a functional
system containing an a2c-adrenoceptor: the human
saphenous vein. it has been demonstrated that
contractions of human saphenous vein to exogenous a-adrenoceptor agonists (muller-schweinitzer,
1984; steen, sjoberg, skarby, norgren & andersson, 1984; giessler et al., 2002), and to the
endogenous
neurotransmitter
noradrenaline
(docherty & hyland, 1985) are mediated predominantly by a2-adrenoceptors. these receptors
mediating contraction in human saphenous vein
did not resemble a2a-adrenoceptors (smith, connaughton & docherty, 1992) but were later
identified as predominantly of the a2c-adrenoceptor subtype, based on the relative potencies of a
series of antagonists (gavin et al., 1997; rizzo
et al., 2001), and this is true also of cultured
saphenous vein (chotani et al., 2004). there is a
report that contractions of human saphenous vein
are mediated predominantly by aa- and a1badrenoceptors after a2-adrenoceptor blockade
(yan et al., 2001), and there are reports that a
combination of a1- and a2-adrenoceptors mediate
contractions (eskinder et al., 1988; roberts, kelly,
cawthorne & sennitt, 1992). some studies
employed noradrenaline (gavin et al., 1997; giessler et al., 2002), others selective a2-adrenoceptor
agonists (rizzo et al., 2001), to demonstrate
a2-adrenoceptor-mediated responses. our studies

were of side branches of main saphenous vein from
varicose vein surgery, other studies used veins
leftover from coronary artery bypass grafts (rizzo
et al., 2001; yan et al., 2001; giessler et al., 2002).
in our studies of side branches of human saphenous
vein, we are satisfied that the response to exogenous noradrenaline is mediated predominantly by
a2-adrenoceptors (e.g. pkb values for  xxxd3000xxx  and
yohimbine were 6.62 ± 0.15, n ¼ 15, and
7.23 ± 0.09, n ¼ 18 respectively; gavin et al.,
1997).
in human saphenous vein, bmy 7378 behaved
as an antagonist of contractions to noradrenaline in
a way consistent with a2c-adrenoceptor antagonism: bmy 7378 was 10 times less potent than
yohimbine and its potency was virtually identical
to its affinity for a2c-adrenoceptors in ligandbinding studies.
we did not study functional a2b-adrenoceptor as
we do not have a simple model system, but we have
examined bmy 7378 in studies that examine
a2d-adrenoceptor function. in prostatic portions of
rat vas deferens (see connaughton & docherty,
1990b), bmy 7378 (10 lm) did not significantly
affect the a2-adrenoceptor agonist xylazine at
inhibiting the isometric contraction to a single
electrical stimulus. this contrasts with a pa2 of
7.50 obtained for yohimbine against xylazine in
prostatic portions of rat vas deferens (connaughton
& docherty, 1990b), so that yohimbine is at least
300 times more potent than bmy 7378 at
a2d-adrenoceptors. in mouse vas deferens, contractile responses to 10 hz field stimulation are affected
in a biphasic manner by a1-adrenoceptor antagonists such as  xxxd3000xxx  (see cleary, vandeputte &
docherty, 2003) and rs 100329 (cleary & docherty, unpublished data): contractile responses were
inhibited by low concentrations, but higher concentrations began to reverse the inhibition. this is
assumed to be due to postjunctional a1-adrenoceptor antagonism by low concentrations, followed by
prejunctional a2d-adrenoceptor antagonism by high
concentrations to increase release especially of the
cotransmitter atp, resulting in restoration of
contraction (see cleary et al., 2003). bmy 7378
(0.01–10 lm) produced a concentration-dependent
inhibition of contractile responses to 10 hz in
mouse vas deferens without any reversal of the
inhibition, suggesting low potency at a2d-adrenoceptors (cleary & docherty, unpublished data).
in addition to actions at a1-adrenoceptors, bmy
7378 is an agonist with low intrinsic activity, or
partial agonist, at 5-ht1a receptors (yocca,
hyslop, smith & maayani, 1987), which can act
as an antagonist of 5-ht1a receptors (chaput &
de montigny, 1988; sharp, backus, hjorth, bramwell & grahame-smith, 1990). in functional
assays of the human  xxxg1108xxx , bmy
7378 has a potency (pec50) of 8.6 (sharif, drace,
williams & crider, 2004). hence, bmy 7378 has

139

l. cleary et al.

autonomic & autacoid
pharmacology,
25, 135–141

partial agonist actions at 5-ht1a receptors at
similar concentrations to which it acts as an a1dadrenoceptor antagonist, and at lower concentrations than it acts at a2c-adrenoceptors.
in conclusion, bmy 7378 was found to be
approximately 10 times less potent than yohimbine at inhibiting contractions to noradrenaline in
human saphenous vein (a2c-adrenoceptor). hence,
bmy 7378 has potency at a2c-adrenoceptors at
the upper end of concentrations used in studies of
a1d-adrenoceptors, and this action must always be
considered in the use of bmy 7378 in concentrations above 0.3 lm as a tool for pharmacological
identification of a1d-adrenoceptors.
