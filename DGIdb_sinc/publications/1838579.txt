tumors derived from primitiveneural crest cells are the most common malignant neoplasms of infancyand early childhood.we recentlyreported
[ah]8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralinspecificbinding in one such tumor, the ganglioneuroblastoma. we now characterize this binding and
compare it with 5-hydroxytryptamine1a (5-ht~a)sites in human and rat cortex. in competitionstudies, the rank order of drug affinitieswas suggestive of a 5-ht~abinding site: 5-ht> 8-oh-dpat, ru24969>  xxxd2621xxx ,methiothepin, 1-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenylaminopropane (doi),
 xxxd2419xxx >  xxxd2637xxx . regressionanalysis showed a correlation with drug affinitiesin human cortex. [3h]8-oh-dpatbinding was saturable and
linear with absence of cooperativity,indicativeof a single population of sites. the density of sites in ganglioneuroblastomawas two- to four-fold
less than in human or rat cortex. [3h]5-htbinding also identified5-ht~binding sites in ganglioneuroblastoma,comparablein density to [3h]8-ohdpat-labelled sites. no specificbinding was found using [3h]paroxetine,[3h]dob,[3h] xxxd2419xxx ,or [3h]mesulergineto label other types of 5-ht
recognitionsites. thesedata confirmthe presenceof a 5- xxxd764xxx -likebinding site in human ganglioneuroblastoma.

5-hydroxytryptamine 1a (5-htia) binding sites have
been identified in the central nervous system of many
species [8, 14]. they are negatively coupled to adenylate
cyclase, are found both pre- and post-synaptically in
brain, can be pharmacologically regulated, and participate in a variety of behaviors and functions such as the
'serotonin syndrome', thermoregulatory, feeding and
sexual behaviors [16]. we recently reported that the selective 5-htia radioligand [3h]8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin labelled binding sites in a neural crestderived tumor of childhood, ganglioneuroblastoma [17].
because this finding may be important to understanding
more about tumor neurobiology and the molecular
genetics of 5-ht1a receptors, we have further characterized [3h]8-oh-dpat binding in human ganglioneuroblastoma. in scatchard and competition experiments, we
compared sites identified by [3h]8-oh-dpat in tumor
to those in human and rat cortex. recent studies of
[3h]8-oh-dpat binding in rat brain have revealed two
distinct sites [10]. in striatum, [3h]8-oh-dpat labels a
lower affinity component besides the 5-htia sites which
may be part of the 5-ht transporter [19]. therefore, we

fig. 1. scatchard analysis of [3h]8-oh-dpat binding in human ganglioneuroblastoma. data are means of 4 ~ separate experiments performed in duplicate. receptor density (bronx) and affinity (kd) were
determined using ebda. insert: saturation isotherm for [3h]8-ohdpat binding in human ganglioneuroblastoma.

min preincubation at 37°c, the homogenate was centrifuged at 49,000 g for 20 min. the tissue was washed once
more for agonist-labelled 5-ht2 and [3h]paroxetine assays. all tissues were resuspended in assay buffers at various tissue volumes. tissue homogenates were added
first to the assay tube. all 5-ht~ assays used the same
assay buffer (final concentration: 4 mm cac12, 10 #m
 xxxd2850xxx , 0.1% ascorbate (w/v), tris hc1/base, ph 7.4
at 37°c).
assays for 5-hti sites were in a total volume of 250
/~1, containing 25/a [3h]radioligand, 25/tl unlabeled 5ht (10 #m) or assay buffer blank, and 200 /a tissue
homogenate (approximately 16 mg wet weight per tube).
incubations lasted 10 min. total 5-ht] sites (unsubtyped) were measured using [3h]5-ht in a 500 #1 assay
[15]. 5-htia sites were labeled with [3h]8-oh-dpat [8].
5-htlc sites were labelled with [3h]mesulergine [13].
agonist-labelled 5-ht2 sites were identified using
[3h]dob with 10/~m cinanserin to define specific binding [20]. antagonist-labelled 5-ht2 sites were identified
using [3h] xxxd2419xxx  with 10 #m  xxxd2621xxx  to define
specific binding [11 ].
[3h]paroxetine was used to label 5-ht uptake sites in
the presence and absence of 10/tm citalopram [9]. the
buffer used throughout contained 120 mm  xxxg2020xxx , 5 mm
kc1, and 50 mm tris hcl/base (ph 7.4 at 25°c). incubations lasted 2 h at 25°c.
the bradford method (biorad assay) with bovine  xxxg124xxx  standards was used to estimate protein
concentration [5].
receptor density (bm,x) and affinity (kd) and hill
coefficients (nil) were obtained from the ebda program. competition experiments were analyzed also
using the curve-fitting program ebda and the chengprusoff equation [6]. for statistical analysis, independent
variables included type of tissue and competing drug and
dependent variables w e r e bmax, g d , g i , nil, and rs. the ef-

fect of independent variables on dependent variables was
analyzed using analysis of variance (anova) in the
statistical analysis system (sas) [18]. for all significant
(p < 0.05) main effects on analysis, comparisons between
individual groups were then made using tukey's test.
regression analysis was also performed on drug affinities from competition experiments.
all tumors studied exhibited 5-ht1a sites (fig. 1). the
binding was linear and saturable in the absence of cooperative interactions (nil near unity), suggesting a
uniform population of binding sites. bmax was 86 _ 17
fmol/mg protein and kn was 2.5 _+ 0.3 nm. the density
of 5-ht1a sites was similar in human and rat cortex:
bmax 441 + 86 and 141 + 15 fmol/mg protein, respectively. corresponding kds were 4.9 _ 0.8 and 1.5 +_ 0.2
nm.
to further study the pharmacologic properties of  xxxg1108xxx  sites in ganglioneuroblastoma, competition studies
of 5-ht agonists and antagonists were performed in
ganglioneuroblastoma. they yielded similar receptor
parameters as those in human and rat cortex (table ii).
in comparisons between ganglioneuroblastoma and human cortex, there were significant differences between
tissues for  xxxd2621xxx , 8-oh-dpat, ru 24969. linear regression of ki values revealed a correlation
between ganglioneuroblastoma and human cortex
(r=0.74) (fig. 2).
5-ht1 sites were also labelled by [3h]5-ht: bmax was
186 + 61 fmol/mg protein, kd 5.6 + 0.7 rim. no 5-ht
uptake, 5-htlc, agonist- or antagonist-labelled 5-ht2
sites were found in ganglioneuroblastoma (n = 3).

these data demonstrate that 5-ht1a but not several
other types of 5-ht binding sites are present in human
ganglioneuroblastoma. pharmacologic similarities with
human and rat brain 5-htia sites makes it unlikely that
this is a 5-ht transporter site. the 200-fold discrepancy
in  xxxd2621xxx  affinity between tumor and brain tissue
is worthy of comment. despite the overall correlation of
ki values, this large difference suggests a possible tumorspecific receptor subtype. because of this finding, it
might be prudent to refer to tumor [3h]8-oh-dpatlabelled sites as 5-htla-like.
some rodent neuroblastoma hybrid cell lines, such as
ncb-20, do possess 5-ht1 receptor recognition sites but
others do not (n4tg1, ng108-15) [2, 3]. 5-ht binding
sites and a 5-ht-sensitive adenylate cyclase were de10-

scribed in a mouse (nb n18tg2) x chinese hamster
brain hybrid (ncb-20) cell line [12]. nonlinear [3h]5-ht
binding described in ncb-20 was eliminated by inclusion of 1 #m spiperone, an effect attributed to the presence of a neuroleptic binding site [3]. however, since spiperone also blocks 5-htia sites [14], 5-ht1a sites may
have been present instead. 5-ht uptake was described in
murine neuroblastoma cells clone n-2a (21) but we found
no 5-ht uptake sites in our tumors. there have been no
previous studies besides ours of 5-ht binding sites in human neural crest tumors.
5-htia receptor recognition sites in human ganglioneuroblastoma may be a new biologic tumor marker.
we previously showed that two other types of neural
crest tumor do not possess 5-htia sites [17]. however,
a broad screening of many other tumor types is necessary to assess the specificity of our findings for ganglioneuroblastoma. we speculate that 5-ht receptor binding studies of human neural crest-derived tumors may
have diagnostic and prognostic significance, possibly
assisting the pathologist in making a tissue diagnosis or
as a correlate of tumor aggressiveness. ganglioneuroblastoma comprises two pathologic subtypes with different biologic properties [4]. the 'composite' type refers to
discrete areas of neuroblastoma and of ganglioneuroma
in the same tumor, as opposed to the 'diffuse' category.
the clinical outcome of ganglioneuroblastomas also
depends on their location (abdominal or extraabdominal) and the age of the patient (child or adult) [1]. our
tumor specimens were mostly composite, intraabdominal, and from children. different types of ganglioneuroblastoma are needed to determine if biochemical subgroups of these tumors exist.
