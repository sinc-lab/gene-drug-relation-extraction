summary
glucosamine inhibits recombinant human interleukin-1
stimulated cartilage degradation in equine cartilage explants.
recently, recombinant equine interleukin-1 has been cloned
and purified. therefore, the objective of this study was to
characterise the effects of glucosamine on indices of cartilage
degradation in recombinant equine  xxxg1170xxx -stimulated equine
articular cartilage explants. cartilage discs were harvested
from the weight-bearing region of the articular surface of the
antebrachiocarpal and middle carpal joints of horses (age 2–8
years) and cultured under standard conditions. explants were
exposed to recombinant equine interleukin-1beta (reil-1beta) on
days 1–4 in the presence or absence of glucosamine (0.25, 2.5
or 25 mg/ml), with appropriate controls.  xxxd2738xxx ,
 xxxd1903xxx , sulphated proteoglycan, stromelysin and
gelatinase/collagenase activity released into conditioned media
and total tissue proteoglycan content were measured as
indicators of cartilage catabolism. glucosamine inhibited
cartilage catabolic responses in a dose dependent manner that
was statistically significant at a dose of 0.25 mg/ml for
stromelysin activity and 2.5 mg/ml for collagenase/gelatinase
activity. at 25 mg/ml glucosamine also prevented il-1betainduced increases in  xxxd2738xxx  production,  xxxd1903xxx 
and proteoglycan release to media. glucosamine prevents
equine articular cartilage degradation experimentally induced
by reil-1beta in vitro. these data provide further support for the
use of glucosamine in treatment or prevention of cartilage loss
in athletic horses.
introduction
osteoarthritis (oa) is a debilitating disease representing a
significant health problem to the equine industry and is probably
the most common cause of lameness. a survey of veterinary
accessions revealed that intra-articular lesions account for 33% of
all diagnosed equine conditions (rose 1977). traditional
treatments, including surgery, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs and corticosteroids, have been augmented by additional
medications possessing the potential to slow the progression of the
disease (disease-modifying or chondroprotective effects) in
addition to treating its symptoms. among these emerging methods
of prevention or treatment of oa lesions are orally-administered
compounds, the most common of which contain glucosamine
and/or chondroitin sulphate.

chondroitin sulphate (cs) consists of chains of sulphated
galactosamine and glucuronic acid molecules. cs is probably not
absorbed intact but rather an enzymatically-degraded metabolite
accounts for its biological activity making it difficult to study its
mechanism of action (baici et al. 1992). however, recent evidence
indicates that cs monomers, oligo and polysaccharides produced
by enzymatic hydrolysis of cs appear in blood and tissues (ronca
et al. 1998). glucosamine, an aminomonosaccharide, is a precursor
of the disaccharide subunits of cartilage proteoglycans. it is rapidly
absorbed and has been shown to concentrate in articular cartilage
(setnikar 1986). it is a naturally occurring, nontoxic compound and
when given orally, decreases pain and improves mobility in
osteoarthritic joints of human subjects (mccarthy 1989). in horses
suffering from clinical signs of oa, an orally-administered
glucosamine hcl-chondroitin sulphate compound alleviated oa
symptoms rapidly (hanson et al. 1997). similar findings have been
observed in dogs treated with an oral glucosamine hcl-chondroitin
sulphate supplement (anderson et al. 1999). the specific
biochemical mechanisms by which glucosamine contributed in the
promising clinical observations have not been fully elucidated. in
general, elucidating the mechanism(s) of action of putative
chondroprotective agents is difficult. using an equine explant
cartilage system as a model for studying equine oa cartilage we
have data indicating that glucosamine hcl significantly reduces
experimentally-induced equine articular cartilage degradation in
vitro (fenton et al. 2000a,b).
currently, most equine articular cartilage explant systems use
lipopolysaccharide (lps) or recombinant human interleukin-1
(rhil-1) to induce cartilage degradation. lps, an endotoxin
produced by gram-negative bacteria, has been shown to induce
cartilage degradation and is present in the joint during septic
arthritis. horses are particularly sensitive to the effects of lps and
one study indicated they are at least 10 times more sensitive to
endotoxin than dogs and other mammals (bottoms et al. 1985).
equine chondrocytes may also be more responsive to lps than
those of other species (macdonald et al. 1994) and may predispose
cartilage to rapid degradation by mechanisms inconsistent with
naturally occurring oa. therefore, the use of lps to study
biochemical events of oa in equine tissue may be suboptimal.
interleukin-1 is a cytokine present in high levels in synovial
fluid of diseased joints (morris et al. 1990) and has been shown
in vitro to induce changes in the extracellular matrix of cartilage
similar to those of oa, including proteoglycan (pg) loss,
increased  xxxd2738xxx  (no) and  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) release,
and synthesis of matrix metalloproteinases (mmps). matrix
metalloproteinases are a family of metal-dependent proteinases
including gelatinases, collagenases and stromelysins, all of
which contribute to degradation of cartilage proteoglycans and

collagens. equine chondrocytes have been shown to produce
these mmps in response to il-1. interleukin-1 also augments the
release of pge2 by equine chondrocytes, an inflammatory
mediator linked to inflammation and pain, the primary clinical
signs of oa.
in published work to date, human recombinant  xxxg1170xxx  has been
used to induce metabolic changes in equine synoviocytes and
chondrocytes simulating those documented to occur in naturally
occurring joint disease. there remains, however, the possibility
that the use of recombinant proteins of different species may result
in unrepresentative responses in equine tissues (mcilwraith 1996).
for example, may et al. (1992) reported that species restrictions
exist on the activity of human il-1 on equine cells.
experiments from our laboratory indicate that glucosamine
inhibits a number of in vitro events (fenton et al. 2000a). lps or
rhil-1 induced no and pg production and gelatinase/collagenase
activity. to date, we have examined neither the effect of
glucosamine on stromelysin activity nor its influence on pge2
synthesis. a fluorescent stromelysin assay has been modified to
examine stromelysin activity in conditioned media from equine
articular cartilage explants and commercially-available assays
have been validated for use in the determination of pge2 of
equine origin. moreover, we have expressed and tested a
recombinant form of equine  xxxg1170xxx  (tung et al. 2002). these
developments enable a more thorough characterisation of
potential chondroprotective effects of glucosamine.
the purpose of this study was to determine if glucosamine
inhibits a number of indices of reil-1beta-induced equine
articular cartilage degradation, including no and pge 2
synthesis, proteoglycan loss, and gelatinase/collagenase and
stromelysin activities.
materials and methods
explant cultures
articular cartilage was obtained from the antebrachiocarpal and
middle carpal joints of horses (age 2–8 years) sacrificed for
reasons other than joint problems. cartilage discs (3.5 mm) were
biopsied from the weight-bearing region of the articular surface.
explants (3 per well, about 40 mg total) were cultured in a 24 well
falcon culture plates in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium:
nutrient mixture f-12 (ham) (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, ascorbate (50 µg/ml) and penicillin/streptomycin
(100 units/ml) in a humidified incubator with 7% co2 at 37ºc
(rosselot et al. 1992). treatments were performed with triplicate
wells using tissue from one animal donor. experiments were
repeated at least 3 times, each time using tissue from a different
animal donor.

explants were maintained in basal media for 2 days prior to
the first of 4 treatment days. recombinant equine il-1 (50 ng/ml)
was added to induce cartilage degradation in the presence or
absence of glucosamine hcl (0.25, 2.5, or 25 mg/ml). treatments
were performed in triplicate and were repeated at least 3 times
with explants from different animal donors. conditioned media
was removed and replaced daily and stored at 4ºc until analysed
for indicators of degradation. treatments and controls are
summarised in table 1.
proteoglycan content
pg release into conditioned media was measured using a
dimethylmethylene blue assay as previously described
(chandrasekhar 1987). briefly, pg content was determined by
measuring sulphated glycosaminoglycan content compared to a
chondroitin sulphate standard and expressed as µg pg/well.
tissue pg content was determined following papain digest (1 mg
papain/mg tissue) of the tissue. tissue pg content was expressed
as µg pg/mg tissue wet weight.
 xxxd2738xxx  determination
nitrite, a stable end product of  xxxd2738xxx  metabolism, was
measured in conditioned media using the greiss reaction and
sodium nitrite as a standard (blanco and martin 1995).
absorbance at 540 nm was determined using a plate reader
(spectramax 300)1. results are expressed as mol/l no/well.
gelatinase/collagenase activity
conditioned media was analysed for gelatinase/collagenase
activity using a commercially available assay kit following the
manufacturer’s directions (enzchek collagenase/gelatinase
assay kit)2. conditioned media (50 µl) were incubated with
dq-gelatin in reaction buffer (0.5 mol/l tris-hcl, 1.5 mol/l
nacl, 50 mmol/l cacl2, 2 mmol/l sodium azide, ph 7.6) for 1 h
at room temperature. enzymatic release of fluorescent signal
from dq-gelatin by either gelatinase or collagenase was
quantitated using a fluorescent plate reader (cytofluor 4000
fluorescent plate reader)3. inhibition of gelatinase/collagenase
activity was performed by the addition of 10 mmol/l
1,10-phenanthroline to the reaction buffer. collagenase from
clostridium histolyticum was used as a standard. results were
presented as units of enzyme activity/ml/h.
stromelysin activity
as for collagenase/gelatinase, stromelysin activity was detected in
conditioned media using a commercial kit according to
manufacturer’s directions4. briefly, conditioned media was
dialysed in buffer (50 mmol/l tris, 5 mmol/l cacl2, ph 7.5) to
remove phenol red and 50 ml of the dialysed sample was
incubated with casein-bodipy in reaction buffer (0.5 mol/l trishcl, 1.5 mol/l nacl, 50 mmol/l cacl2, 2 mmol/l sodium azide,
ph 7.6) for 4 h at room temperature. enzymatic release of
fluorescent signal from casein-bodipy by stromelysin was
quantified using a fluorescent plate reader (enzchek protease
assay kit)2. inhibition of stromelysin activity was performed by
the addition of 10 mmol/l 1, 10-phenanthroline to the reaction
buffer. recombinant stromelysin kindly donated by dr m. smith
(university of missouri) was used as a standard. one unit of
activity was defined as the ability to change the fluorescence by
1000 units. results were presented as units of enzyme
activity/ml/h.

 xxxd1903xxx  immunoassay
 xxxd1903xxx  release into conditioned media was determined
using a commercially available elisa5. an aliquot of the
conditioned media was collected from culture wells and 10 µg/ml
indomethacin was added to inhibit prostaglandin synthase. samples
were stored at -20ºc until analysis. media samples were diluted
1:15 and assayed according to the manufacturer instructions.
statistical analysis
data for indicators of degradation were analysed using the
repeated measure option of the sas statistical software proc
mixed (anon 1996). no interaction of day was present and all
data were therefore represented as the average response of the 3
treatment wells at 24 h after treatment addition. treatments were
compared using the bonferroni procedure. statistical significance
was considered at p<0.05 unless noted.
results
recombinant equine il-1-stimulated control cartilage explants
had significant increases in no, pge2, sulphated proteoglycan
and mmp activities in conditioned media compared to untreated

controls. glucosamine hcl demonstrated a dose-dependent
inhibition of the cytokine-induced responses. specifically,
glucosamine significantly inhibited no production at 25.0 mg/ml
(fig 1a), and also inhibited pg release at the highest dose (fig 1b).
glucosamine did not alter total tissue pg content compared to all
other treatments (fig 1c).
gelatinase/collagenase activity was significantly inhibited
by glucosamine at 2.5 mg/ml (p≤0.01) and there was no
detectable activity at 25 mg/ml (p≤0.001) (fig 2a).
glucosamine also significantly inhibited stromelysin activity at
0.25 and 2.5mg/ml (p≤0.01) and there was no detectable
activity at 25.0 mg/ml (p≤0.001) (fig 2b).  xxxd1903xxx  was
significantly inhibited by glucosamine at 2.5 and 25.0 mg/ml
(p≤0.001) (fig 3).
discussion
in vivo investigation of equine articular cartilage is relatively
difficult due to the nature of the tissue, expense of animals and the
emotional response it elicits working with a companion animal. as
with any in vivo experiment, determining the specific source of
biochemical signals influencing chondrocyte metabolism is
difficult. therefore, articular cartilage can be cultured as full
thickness tissue with the extracellular matrix surrounding the
chondrocytes intact. we can regulate the tissue exposure to cell
signalling molecules. however, the matrix of articular cartilage can
vary by joint, region, area and zonal depth of cartilage. accounting
for these limitations, in vitro culture of articular cartilage can
provide an excellent experimental model for studying equine
articular cartilage responses to different compounds.
studying osteoarthritic cartilage in vitro can be complicated.
diseased articular cartilage is grossly altered by erosion or loss of

matrix components and lesion distribution and severity vary
throughout the joint. therefore, regulatory factors implicated in
the disease process have been isolated and used to induce cartilage
degradation experimentally in explant culture. the regulatory
factors most commonly studied include interleukin-1 and lps. as
previously described, both induce cartilage changes relatively
consistent with early oa. until reil-1 became available, equine
systems used a human form of this protein to induce degradation.
this research could be criticised because of the potential
differential response of equine tissue to human proteins. some
evidence exists to support this criticism. equine cells respond
differently than human cells to human il-1 (may et al. 1992). in
addition, the amino acid sequence of equine  xxxg1170xxx 
showed only 66.7% homology to human  xxxg1170xxx  (kato
et al. 1995). therefore, the use of recombinant equine protein may
be more applicable to study cartilage turnover in equine cartilage.
the purity and specific activity of reil-1 used in our study was not
stringently quantified in our preparation and direct molar
comparisons between it and rhil-1 cannot, therefore, be made
(tung et al. 2002).
we have shown that glucosamine hcl inhibits lps or rhil-1
induced cartilage degradation as indicated by decreased sulphated
pg and no release and matrix metalloproteinase (mmp) activity,
while the glucose control did not (fenton et al. 2000a). possible
mechanisms of action include a simple quenching of small signal
molecules including no and oxygen radicals that can damage
articular cartilage (homandberg et al. 1997). glucosamine may
also mediate matrix metalloproteinase degradation of cartilage,
often thought of as the hallmark of oa. glucosamine has been
shown to inhibit aggrecanase, a metalloproteinase in the
adamts family, in il-1 stimulated bovine cartilage explants
(sandy et al. 1998). this inhibition was apparently not due to any
cytotoxicity or interference with il-1 signalling, since protein
synthesis and lactate production were not altered by glucosamine.
in agreement with these data, we have shown that glucosamine
was effective in inhibiting reil-1 induced gelatinase/collagenase
and stromelysin activity at mg/ml concentrations.
the concentration of other inflammatory mediators
associated with cartilage degradation, including no and pge2
were significantly reduced in conditioned media from explants
cultured in the presence of reil-1beta and glucosamine at a
concentration of 25 mg/ml. this pharmacological dose served to
illustrate the potential of glucosamine to inhibit cellular
processes, despite that this concentration is unlikely to be

achieved in vivo. although we were not able to detect any
decrease in cell viability (data not shown), the possibility exists
that a dose of 25 mg/ml could have cytotoxic effects.
nonetheless, a dose-dependent reduction was uniformly observed
and statistical significance may have been observed had there
been a greater number of wells for each treatment. further studies
also are being conducted to determine the lowest concentrations
necessary to inhibit no and pge2 production.
many compounds are commercially available which claim to
‘improve joint health’. systems must be developed to study the
effects of these compounds on the joint (negative or positive).
studies like ours, using equine tissue and an equine cytokine, are
critical for screening and providing biochemical evidence
supporting or refuting the claims of commercially available
nutritional supplements. recognising that in vitro data should be
cautiously applied to the in vivo situation, this study provides
valuable information regarding the effects of glucosamine on
equine articular cartilage and supports the favourable results that
have been reported in clinical trials conducted in man and
domestic animals.
