increased. we examined folate,  xxxd1771xxx  and homocysteine serum
concentrations and polymorphism of the c677t  xxxg1475xxx  gene in
turkish children with neural tube defects. thirty-three children with
ntds, 26 mothers and 48 healthy individuals were studied. c677t
 xxxg1475xxx  polymorphism was determined by melting curve analyses
(lightcycler®). the levels of folate,  xxxd1771xxx  and homocysteine
serum concentrations in ntds were evaluated and compared, along
with information concerning alleles of the  xxxg1475xxx  gene. c677t
allele frequencies in ntd children and their mothers were similar to
those found in controls. serum folate and  xxxd1771xxx  concentrations
were significantly higher in ntd children than that of controls.
serum homocysteine concentrations were not significantly higher in
ntd children and mothers. we concluded that c677t  xxxg1475xxx  gene
polymorphism does not affect  xxxd2146xxx ,  xxxd1771xxx  and homocysteine
metabolism in turkish children with ntds. c677t polymorphism of
the  xxxg1475xxx  gene cannot be regarded as a major risk factor for ntds
in turkish children.

introduction
neural tube defects (ntds) that occur due to failure of neural tube closure are among
the most prevalent and severe of all birth defects. a multifactorial mode of inheritance, including genetic predisposition, maternal nutritional deficiencies and other environmental factors, is implicated in the etiology of ntds (eskes, 1998; melvin et al., 2000). ntds, which
encompass a broad spectrum of phenotypes ranging from spina bifida to anencephaly, affect
approximately 3 per 1000 live births in turkey (aydinli et al., 1998; tunçbilek et al., 1999).
folate deficiency during pregnancy is considered to be one of the most important risk factors
for ntds and its supplementation before and during early pregnancy can significantly reduce
the prevalence of ntds (eskes, 1998).
the  xxxg1475xxx  ( xxxg1475xxx ) gene is located on chromosome
1 at 1p36.3 (goyette et al., 1998).  xxxg1475xxx  is a key enzyme in folate metabolism. its deficiency usually leads to a significant reduction in plasma concentrations of folate,  xxxd1771xxx 
and methionine, whereas homocysteine is increased (eskes, 1998). impairment in folate metabolism is implicated as a risk factor for ntds. the  xxxg1475xxx  gene with a substitution in nucleotide 677 (c to t), which allows the generation of a thermolabile enzyme with decreased
activity, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ntds in some populations (eskes, 1998;
van der put and blom, 2000; melvin et al., 2000). on the other hand, the association between
c677t  xxxg1475xxx  gene polymorphism and ntds could not be demonstrated in other studies
(boduroglu et al., 1999; volcick et al., 2000).
in the present study, we analyzed the concentration of folate,  xxxd1771xxx  and homocysteine and the distribution of c677t  xxxg1475xxx  gene polymorphism in turkish children with
ntds, their mothers and healthy individuals.

material and methods
patient population
we studied 33 children aged between 6 days and 11 years with ntds, and mothers
of ntd children (20-39 years old) both seen at the afyonkarahisar kocatepe university hospital, afyonkarahisar, turkey. the control group consisted of 48 unrelated individuals (25-40
years old), from the same region. clinical distribution of lesions in ntd children is presented
in table 3. the local ethics committee approved the protocol and written informed consent
was obtained from the participants and their relatives.

biochemical analysis
whole blood was directly drawn into a vacutainer® serum tube without anti-coagulant, then allowed to clot at 4 ± 2°c for 15-20 min and promptly centrifuged at 2000 g for 10
min at 4 ± 2°c. serum samples were stored at -80°c until analysis.
homocysteine levels in serum samples were quantified with the use of a dade behring
bn* ii nephelometer according to the manufacturer protocol. in vitro diagnostic reagents
for the quantitative determination of total homocysteine in human serum was performed by
means of particle enhanced immunonephelometry with the bn* ii system. the concentration
of homocysteine is reported as µmol/l.
serum  xxxd1771xxx  levels were quantified with the beckman coulter access® immunoassay system. the access  xxxd1771xxx  assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent
immunoassay for the quantitative determination of  xxxd1771xxx  levels in human serum using
the access immunoassay system. data are reported as pg/ml.
the levels of serum folate were quantified with the use of the architect® system
(abbott laboratories). the architect folate assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle  xxxg807xxx  assay for the quantitative determination of folate in serum. the architect
folate assay is a two-step assay to determine the presence of folate in human serum using the chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (cmia) technology with flexible assay protocols,
referred to as chemiflextm. two pretreatment steps mediate the release of folate from endogenous
folate-binding protein. the levels of folate are reported as ng/ml.

genetic analysis
dna was extracted from a 200-µl peripheral blood sample by a high pure template
preparation (roche diagnostics, indianapolis, in, usa) kit. then, dna amount and dna
purity were quantified for each dna sample by spectrophotometry (nanodrop nd-1000).
dna samples were stored at -20°c until use.
lightcycler® faststartplus dna master hybridization probes (roche diagnostics),
lightmix® (tib molbiol, berlin, germany) and lightcycler® instrument 1.2 were used for
analyzing the c677t polymorphism in the  xxxg1475xxx  gene.
a 233-bp fragment of the  xxxg1475xxx  gene is amplified with specific primers and detected with probes labeled with lightcycler® red 640 (detected in channel 640). cycling conditions for  xxxg1475xxx  were initial denaturation at 95°c for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles with

denaturation at 95°c for 5 s, annealing at 55°c for 10 s and extension at 72°c for 15 s with a
ramping time of 20°c/s. after amplification, melting curves have been generated following
denaturation of the reaction at 95°c for 20 s, holding the sample at 40°c for 20 s and then
slowly heating the sample to 85°c with a ramp rate of 0.2°c/s and simultaneous monitoring
of fluorescence decline (figure 1). polymorphism is determined by running a melting curve
with a specific melting point (tm) of 55 ± 1.5°c for the mutant and 62.5 ± 1.5°c for the wild
type in channel 640. the supplied positive control allows the verification of the experiment
(tib molbiol).

figure 1. melting-curve analysis was performed to analyze the  xxxg1475xxx  c677t polymorphism.

statistical analysis
statistical analyses were performed using spss for windows (version 13.0, spss
inc., chicago, il, usa). the chi-square test was used to compare allele frequencies and genotypes for the 677cc/ct/tt position in the  xxxg1475xxx  gene between ntd children, mothers and
healthy individuals. to evaluate the effect of the polymorphism on the variation of biochemical parameters, a one-way analysis of variance was performed. the tukey hsd test was used
for intra-group comparisons. statistical significance was established at p < 0.05.

results
of 33 children with ntds, 13 were girls and 20 were boys. none of the mothers had
used  xxxd2146xxx  preconceptionally. there were not any factors associated with ntd, such as
exposure to radiation, anticonvulsant medication, chemical substances, or diabetes mellitus.
table 1 shows the distribution of genotype and allele frequencies for c677t  xxxg1475xxx 
polymorphisms in ntd children, ntd mothers, and controls. according to the data, the c677t
 xxxg1475xxx  genotype frequencies in ntd children and ntd mothers were similar to those of the
controls (c2 = 0.702, p = 0.704). similarly, the 677tt genotype frequency was not higher than
controls in ntd cases and mothers (chi2 = 2.081, p = 0.353). frequencies of c and t alleles between the three groups were not statistically significant (chi2 = 3.894, p = 0.143).
we evaluated the effect of the c677t genotype on vitamin concentrations. there was a
significant difference in serum folate and  xxxd1771xxx  concentrations between groups (p = 0.041
and 0.002, respectively) (table 2).
serum homocysteine concentration was not significantly higher in ntd children and
mothers as compared to controls (p = 0.226) (table 2).

discussion
in our study, the results of c677t polymorphism of  xxxg1475xxx  gene analysis did not
show an association between ntd children, mothers and controls. the frequency of t allele
in affected children was similar to those found in ntd patients from europe and turkey (boduroglu et al., 1999; van der put and blom, 2000; volcick et al., 2000). however, the direct association between c677t polymorphism of the  xxxg1475xxx  gene and ntds found in other populations could not be demonstrated in our study (eskes, 1998; melvin et al., 2000; cunha et al.,
2002; karalti et al., 2007). the reason for the variance between different studies could be the
difference of 677t allele frequency among different populations. countries where  xxxg1475xxx 
polymorphism has been implicated in the susceptibility to ntds had relatively low frequency
of the 677t allele in the control group. the c677t polymorphism was shown to induce an
enzyme with thermolabile properties and with decreased activity, resulting in elevated plasma
homocysteine concentrations (frosst et al., 1995). the effect of the c677t polymorphism can
be reversed by additional  xxxd2146xxx  intake (anonymous, 1991; medical research council
vitamin study research group).
lesion distribution of ntds was similar between the genotypes of three groups in our
study. the study of samson (2003) did not find any statistically significant association between
the lesion distribution of ntds in consanguineous and non-consanguineous populations.
in the ntd patients of our study, the c677t polymorphism did not reduce the concentrations of serum folate and  xxxd1771xxx . surprisingly, ntd children showed increased total serum
folate and  xxxd1771xxx  concentrations. among the cc/ct/tt genotypes, children with the 677cc
genotype showed increased  xxxd1771xxx , but this was not significant (p = 0.802). those with
c677t polymorphism had significantly decreased homocysteine levels (p = 0.045). decreased
serum folate and  xxxd1771xxx  concentrations in mothers in this study could be an important factor
working synergistically with another genotype of  xxxg1475xxx . genetic-nutrient interaction ( xxxg1475xxx 
polymorphism and low folate status) is associated with a greater risk for ntds than each variable
alone (christensen et al., 1999). thirteen percent of ntds were attributed to the c677t  xxxg1475xxx 
polymorphism but 50-70% of all ntds could be prevented by periconceptional  xxxd2146xxx  supplementation (posey et al., 1996). this suggest that other polymorphisms in the  xxxg1475xxx  gene or
other genes involving in folate pathways might have roles in ntds. low  xxxd1771xxx  concentrations could also reduce methylation of homocysteine to methionine, enhancing the impairment of
folate metabolism and increasing the risk for ntds (van der put and blom, 2000).

homocysteine levels of mothers in our study were minimally increased but this was not
significant. polymorphism in genes involving homocysteine metabolism could affect the plasma
levels. data on the homocysteine levels were contradictory. van der put et al. (1998) demonstrated
that the c677t polymorphism in the  xxxg1475xxx  gene caused elevated homocysteine levels. according to the study, homocysteine levels alone might not always show the possible molecular defect.
in conclusion, our study indicates that c677t  xxxg1475xxx  gene polymorphism does not
affect  xxxd2146xxx ,  xxxd1771xxx  or homocysteine metabolism in turkish children with ntds.
maternal folate and  xxxd1771xxx  status during the periconceptional period may be critical in
the development of ntds, and our data support the hypothesis of the multifactorial etiology
of ntds, involving the combination of both genetic and nutritional factors. a higher number
of ntd patients need to be studied to confirm these results.
