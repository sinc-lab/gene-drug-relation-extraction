1 to characterize the prostanoid receptors (tp, fp, ep1 and/or ep3) involved in the
vasoconstriction of human pulmonary veins, isolated venous preparations were challenged with
dierent prostanoid-receptor agonists in the absence or presence of selective antagonists.
2 the stable thromboxane a2 mimetic, u46619, was a potent constrictor agonist on human
pulmonary veins (pec50=8.60+0.11 and emax=4.61+0.46 g; n=15). the anity values for two
selective tp-antagonists (bay u3405 and gr32191b) versus u46619 were bay u3405:
pa2=8.94+0.23 (n=3) and gr32191b: apparent pkb=8.25+0.34 (n=3), respectively. these
results are consistent with the involvement of tp-receptor in the u46619 induced contractions.
3 the two ep1-/ep3- agonists (17-phenyl-pge2 and sulprostone) induced contraction of human
pumonary veins (pec50=8.56+0.18; emax=0.56+0.24 g; n=5 and pec50=7.65+0.13;
emax=1.10+0.12 g; n=14, respectively). the potency ranking for these agonists: 17-phenylpge24sulprostone suggests the involvement of an ep1-receptor rather than ep3. in addition, the
contractions induced by sulprostone, 17-phenyl-pge2 and the ip-/ep1- agonist ( xxxd2331xxx ) were
blocked by the dp-/ep1-/ xxxg1873xxx -receptor antagonist (ah6809) as well as by the ep1 antagonist
(sc19220).
4  xxxd1902xxx  induced small contractions which were blocked by ah6809 while ¯uprostenol was
ineective. these results indicate that fp-receptors are not implicated in the contraction of human
pulmonary veins.
5 these data suggest that the contractions induced by prostanoids involved tp- and ep1-receptors
in human pulmonary venous smooth muscle.

introduction
prostanoids may contract or relax smooth muscle by
activating dierent prostanoid receptors (coleman et al.,
1994). results derived from isolated tissues showed that
prostanoid activation of tp-, fp-, ep1- or ep3-receptors
produced smooth muscle contraction by increasing ca2+ or
reducing  xxxd1773xxx  intracellular levels (negishi et al.,
1995). the preferential receptor for thromboxane a2 (tpreceptor) has been extensively described in platelet aggregation and in smooth muscle contraction (shen & tai, 1998).
in most of the human arteries, u46619 the tp selective
agonist induced contraction (maddox et al., 1985; ohlstein et
al., 1988; uski et al., 1984; baxter et al., 1995; templeton et
al., 1991), while studies on human veins have been rarely
reported. however, the tp-receptor has been described in
vasoconstriction of veins in the hand, the placenta and the
leg (arner et al., 1991; boura et al., 1986; mais et al., 1985).
the involvement of fp-, ep1- or ep3-receptors in the
contraction of numerous non-human smooth muscle preparations is frequently reported. the activation of fp*author for correspondence: e-mail: xnorel@hotmail.com

receptors by prostanoids induced contraction of cat iris
sphincter, bovine ciliary muscle, rabbit uterus and ewe
myometrium (woodward et al., 1989; krauss et al., 1997;
chen et al., 1998; crankshaw & gaspar, 1995). in mammals,
activation of ep3-receptor induced contraction of smooth
muscles present in ileum, colon, myometrium and corpus
luteum (botella et al., 1993; 1995; crankshaw & gaspar,
1995; sharif et al., 1998). the ep1-receptor has been
classically described using selective antagonist (sc19220)
against pge2-induced contractions in preparations derived
from either the guinea-pig trachea or gastrointestinal tract
(kennedy et al., 1982; coleman & kennedy, 1985). however,
few studies characterizing fp-, ep1- or ep3- receptors
involved in the control of human vascular tone have been
reported. the fp-receptor has been described in dierent
non-vascular human smooth muscle: urinary bladder, and
myometrium (palea et al., 1998; senior et al., 1992).
furthermore, ep1-receptors have not been associated with
any human smooth muscle contraction and there is limited
data on human pulmonary artery and myometrium contractions due to ep3-receptor activation (qian et al., 1994; senior
et al., 1993).

the aim of the present study was to investigate not only
the tp but also the fp-, ep1- or ep3-receptors associated
with the contractions induced by prostanoids in human
pulmonary veins.

methods
isolated preparations
human lung tissues were obtained from patients (21 male
and four female) who had undergone surgery for lung
carcinoma. the mean age was 58+2 years. pulmonary
venous preparations were removed, dissected free from
adjoining connective tissue and lung parenchyma, placed in
tyrode's solution (concentration mm): nacl 139.2, kcl 2.7,
cacl2 1.8, mgcl2 0.49, nahco3 11.9, nah2po4 0.4 and
glucose 5.5; ph 7.4 and maintained at 48c. all preparations
were used within 1 ± 12 h postsurgery. vascular preparations
with intact endothelium were cut as rings (3 ± 6 mm internal
diameter, 3 ± 5 mm in length). the rings were then set up in
10 ml organ baths containing tyrode's solution, gassed with
95% o2/5% co2 and maintained at 378c. an optimal load
(1.5 g), which ensured maximal physiological responses to the
agonists, was applied to each ring.
changes in force were recorded by isometric force displacement transducers (narco f-60) and physiographs (linseis).
subsequently, preparations were allowed to equilibrate for
90 min with bath ¯uid changes taking place every 10 min.

experimental protocol
after the equilibration period, the venous preparations were
incubated 30 min with indomethacin (1.7 mm) and 15 min
with ng-nitro-l-arginine (l-noarg; 0.1 mm). these agents
were used to avoid any physiological eect induced by the
release of endogenous prostanoids and  xxxd2738xxx . the
preparations were then contracted with increasing concentrations of prostanoids or selective agonists applied in a
cumulative fashion. in some experiments, during the
incubation period, dierent antagonists: bay u3405 (tp),
gr32191b (tp), ah6809 (dp/ep1/ xxxg1873xxx ) or sc19220 (ep1)
were added with indomethacin and l-noarg. these
antagonist were used to determine either their anity values
or to illustrate one response through activation of a single
receptor subtype for the agonists which may act on dierent
receptor subtypes. the maximal contraction of each preparation with norepinephrine (10 mm) was obtained at the end of
each experimental protocol.

data analysis
the changes in force were measured from isometric
recordings in grams (g). the contractions produced with
the dierent agonists were expressed either as grams or as per
cent of the contraction induced with norepinephrine. the
maximal contraction (emax value) produced with an agonist
and the half-maximum eective concentration value (ec50
value) were interpolated from the individual concentrationeect curves. the pec50 values were calculated as the
negative log of ec50 values. when the pec50 values obtained
in the absence and presence of antagonist were signi®cantly

dierent and the tentative assumption was made that the
schild equation held in our experiments, then the apparent
pkb value was calculated as the negative log of the
equilibrium dissociation constant for the antagonist (kb
value). the kb value was determined using the schild
equation: kb=[b]/(dr-1), where [b] is the concentration of
the antagonist and dr (dose ratio) is the ratio of ec50 values
of agonist in the presence and absence of antagonist. in
studies on veins with the contractile agonist u46619, dierent
concentrations of bay u3405 were used to determine the pa2
value according to the method of arunlakshana & schild
(1959). for each lung sample, schild plot analysis was
performed, the slope and pa2 value were determined by least
square ®tting of a regression line to the points. all results are
expressed as means+s.e.mean and were derived from
dierent lung samples (n). statistical analysis was performed
using student's paired or unpaired t-test and mann-whitney
rank sum test with a con®dence level of 95%.

results
the cocktail of inhibitors (indomethacin, l-noarg) and
antagonists with which the venous preparations were
incubated induced a small contraction on the resting tone
of these preparations (0.07+0.06 g; n=18). at the end of the
protocols, venous preparations were contracted with norepinephrine (10 mm: 3.10+0.44 g; n=25).
concentration-dependent contractions of human pulmonary venous preparations produced by u46619 are shown
figure 1a and table 1. u46619 was a potent constrictor with
a maximal eect which was 50% greater than that induced by
norepinephrine (10 mm). bay u3405 (0.03; 0.1; 0.3 mm)
caused a concentration-related rightward shift of the
u46619 concentration-eect curves with a pa2 of
8.94+0.23 (n=3) and a schild plot slope of 1.07+0.03,
which was not signi®cantly dierent from unity. these values

were derived from schild plots (figure 1b). in additional lung
samples, bay u3405 and gr32191b (1 mm) reduced the
emax and/or the pec50 values obtained from u46619

u3405 (1 mm) the u46619 concentration-eect curves were
dicult to restore and no plateau was reached even at the
maximal concentration available for u46619 (10 mm). when
possible, the apparent pkb values for each concentration of
bay u3405 and gr32191b were calculated and these values
are presented table 1.
concentration-eect curves induced by sulprostone on
human pulmonary venous preparations in the absence of
antagonist were biphasic, the average curve failed to reach a
plateau and was not sigmoõè dal (figure 2). the contraction
obtained with the highest available concentration of
sulprostone was 54+09% (n=5) of norepinephrine contraction (figure 2). sigmoõè dal curves were obtained with
sulprostone, in the presence of either bay u3405 (1;
10 mm) or gr32191b (10 mm) and the emax did not exceed
50% of the norepinephrine contraction (figure 2 and table
1).
in presence of bay u3405 (1 mm), the contractions induced
by sulprostone on venous preparations were inhibited by
ah6809 (10; 30 or 100 mm; figure 3a and table 1). ah6809
(30, 100 mm) had a non-competitive behaviour on sulprostone
responses, the antagonism was not reversible. under the same
conditions (presence of bay u3405, 1 mm), sc19220
(100 mm) signi®cantly inhibited the vasoconstrictions induced
by sulprostone (figure 3a). in presence of this latter
treatment, the contraction obtained with the highest available
concentration of sulprostone was 32+09% (n=3) of
norepinephrine contraction, the derived estimations of
pec50 and apparent pkb were (56.97+0.41, 44.75+0.36),
respectively. ah6809 (10 mm) signi®cantly inhibited the
vasoconstrictions induced by 17-phenyl-pge2 in the human
pulmonary veins treated with bay u3405, 1 mm, (figure 3b
and table 1). in this latter protocol, the contraction obtained

(10 mm, n=3; data not shown).
in human pulmonary veins pre-treated with bay u3405

the present report suggests the involvement of tp- and ep1receptors in the prostanoid induced contraction of human
pulmonary venous preparations.
the contractions observed with u46619 (stable thromboxane a2 mimetic) and their inhibition by the selective tpantagonists (gr32191b, lumley et al., 1989 and bay u3405,
mckenni et al., 1991) suggest the presence of a tp-receptor
in human pulmonary veins. these results have not previously
been reported although the tp-receptor has been frequently
described in human pulmonary arteries (maddox et al., 1985;
sjoberg & steen, 1989; lumley et al., 1989; norel et al., 1991;
ellis & muller-schweinitzer, 1991; qian et al., 1994; jino et
al., 1996). pharmacological studies as well as investigations
using molecular biology have suggested heterogeneity among
thromboxane receptors (lumley et al., 1989; tymkewycz et
al., 1991; furci et al., 1991; pierce & regan, 1998). actually,
the anity values calculated in human pulmonary veins for
gr32191b (8.25+0.34) and bay u3405 (8.94+0.23) are
comparable to those found in human pulmonary arteries:
gr32191b (8.18 ± 8.3; lumley et al., 1989; qian et al., 1994)
and bay u3405 (9.25; norel et al., 1991), respectively. these
data suggest that the tp-receptor present in both human
pulmonary arteries and veins may be the same. in addition,
the apparent pkb values obtained with gr32191b (present
study) were also in accordance with those derived from
pharmacological studies performed on human umbilical

artery (8.04; templeton et al., 1991), uterine artery (8.5;
baxter et al., 1995) or human platelet (8.2 ± 8.8; lumley et al.,
1989).
the tp-receptor in human pulmonary veins was also
activated by the high concentration (41 mm) of sulprostone
and the tp antagonists eliminated this response. sulprostone
is classically described as a selective agonist for ep1- and
ep3- receptors (coleman et al., 1987a, b; 1988; reeves et al.,
1988), however high concentrations (30 mm) have been
reported to induce contractions of the human bronchial
preparations and isolated uterine artery where tp-receptors
are the only excitatory prostanoid-receptors (coleman &
sheldrick, 1989; baxter et al., 1995). the ®ndings (present
study) are in agreement with this previous observation, high
concentrations of sulprostone may act on the tp-receptor
and for this reason all the experiments involving this
compound were carried out in the presence of bay u3405.
in human pulmonary veins, sulprostone and 17-phenylpge2 (in presence of bay u3405) induced smaller contractions than the response induced by u46619. the contractions
of human pulmonary veins induced by sulprostone or 17phenyl-pge2, suggest the involvement of ep1- or ep3receptors. the sensitivities (pec50 value) of the venous
preparations to sulprostone and 17-phenyl-pge2 were
comparable to those determined in standard functional
assays for ep1-receptor, namely, the contractions of guineapig fundus (coleman et al., 1987a) and trachea (lawrence et
al., 1992). in the present study, the potency ranking for these
agonist, 17-phenyl-pge24sulprostone (equi-eective molar
ratio=8 and 1, respectively), was similar to the one observed
in the previous standard ep1-tissues. in these later tissues or
in binding studies with cloned ep1-receptor (rat, boie et al.,
1997; mouse, watabe et al., 1993; mouse, kiriyama et al.,
1997), 17-phenyl-pge2 was 1.5 ± 4 fold more potent than
sulprostone. a greater potency, 10 fold, was found for 17phenyl-pge2 when compared with sulprostone to increase

activation of ep1-receptor (guan et al., 1998). in contrast,
the rank order of potency for these agonists was reversed in
studies where the eects were mediated by the activation of
ep3-receptors. sulprostone was a more potent contractile
agonist, 30 ± 45 fold greater than 17-phenyl-pge2 either in
human pulmonary artery (qian et al., 1994) or when
inhibiting the twitch contraction of guinea-pig vas deferens
(lawrence et al., 1992). these results (present study) support
the presence of an ep1-receptor associated with contraction
in human pulmonary veins rather than an ep3-receptor. in
addition,  xxxd2331xxx , a selective agonist for ip and ep1receptors (schroèr et al., 1981; dong & jones, 1982; dong
et al., 1986) induced contraction of these preparations even
though ip-receptors responsible for relaxation are present
(walch et al., 1999).
the eects of either the dp-/ep1-/ xxxg1873xxx - receptor antagonist
(ah6809; coleman et al., 1985; keery & lumley, 1988;
woodward et al., 1995) or the ep1-receptor antagonist
(sc19220; sanner, 1969; kennedy et al., 1982; coleman et
al., 1987a, b) against the concentration-eect curves (present
study) produced by both sulprostone and 17-phenyl-pge2
also suggest the involvement of the ep1-receptor rather than
ep3. however, the anity values calculated or estimated for
ah6809 in preparations derived from human lung (apparent
pkb of 5.52 and 45.88) are lower than those obtained in
similar physiological experiments performed in guinea-pig or
dog ep1-preparations. lawrence et al. (1992) using sulprostone or 17-phenyl-pge2 as the contractile agonist, found the
ah6809 anity values ranking from 6.1 ± 7.35 in either
guinea-pig ileum or trachea. in other studies using pge2 with
the ep1-preparations (guinea-pig fundus, ileum and dog
fundus), the anity values for ah6809 ranked from 6.6 ± 7.4
( xxxd1704xxx  & whiting 1988; coleman et al., 1985). similarly, the
estimated anity value found for sc19220 in the present
study (apparent pkb44.75) was lower than the pa2 of 5.6
calculated in experiments performed with the previous ep1preparations (coleman et al., 1985; coleman & kennedy,
1985). the reason for this discrepancy remains to be
established. however, when ep1-receptors were assessed in
either physiological or binding studies, the anity values for
ah6809 were always one order of magnitude greater than
those for sc19220 (present study; coleman et al., 1985; boie
et al., 1997; funk et al., 1993). since high concentrations of
ah6809 (5 ± 100 mm) or sc19220 (100 ± 300 mm) did not
block the ep3 mediated eects in many of the ep3 biological
models (table 2), the inhibitory eect of these antagonists in
human pulmonary vein would suggest that the ep3-receptor
is not involved in contractions.
the variable eects induced by pge2 in the human
pulmonary venous preparations in presence of the tpantagonist may be explained by two opposing eects of this
prostaglandin in these preparations. a contraction via the
ep1-receptor and a relaxation via another ep-receptor
subtype as has been suggested by walch et al. (1999). a
similar paradoxical eect was observed in guinea-pig trachea
as well as in human bronchial preparations where pge2 may
act on ep1- and/or tp- receptors to induce contraction while
the activation of the  xxxg1873xxx -receptor provokes the relaxation
(gardiner, 1975; coleman & kennedy, 1980; mckenni et
al., 1988).
the results obtained in this report with the ep- agonists or
antagonists suggest a role for ep1- and not ep3- receptor in

the ep3-receptor was activated by either pge2, enprostil, sulprostone or 17-phenyl-pge2.

the contraction of human pulmonary vein. the involvement
of ep1- or ep3- receptors in the control of vascular tone has
been principally investigated in the ocular vascular bed. the
ep- agonists decrease the intraocular pressure in various
animal models of glaucoma (woodward et al., 1993; 1994;
bhattacherjee et al., 1999; waterbury et al., 1990) and
contract the pig retinal vessels (abran et al., 1994). however,
the ep3-receptor is involved in vasoconstriction of guinea-pig
aorta (jones et al., 1998), rat renal aerent arteriole (tang et
al., 2000) and human pulmonary artery (qian et al., 1994).
arner & hoègestatt (1991) showed that  xxxd2331xxx  contracted the
human hand vein. one could associate this response with
activation of an ep1-receptor. the data (present study)
demonstrated a similar response to that of the hand veins
whereas human arterial preparations did not exhibit a
contractile response to this agonist (arner & hoègestatt,
1991; qian et al., 1994). therefore, the presence of ep1receptors may be found only in human venous preparations.
the low potency of  xxxd1902xxx  or ¯uprostenol, the selective
agonist for fp-receptor, suggests that the fp-receptor is not
involved in the contraction of human pulmonary veins. in

addition, the small contractions induced by  xxxd1902xxx  were
inhibited by ah6809 suggesting that  xxxd1902xxx  activates an ep1rather than fp- receptor.
in summary, the ®ndings in the present study are
consistent with the presence of tp- and ep1- receptors
mediating constriction of human pulmonary veins. these
®ndings may be relevant to the pulmonary circulation.
sulprostone is used in obstetrics and gynaecology and one
of the clinical side eects observed with this compound is
pulmonary oedema (stock et al., 1995; levy et al., 1994;
puura et al., 1995). the present study and the work of qian
et al. (1994) suggest that this side eect may involve
vasospasm of the whole pulmonary vasculature. such epagonist may activate at the same time tp-, ep3- receptors in
the arteries and tp-, ep1- receptors in the veins.

brille for excellent technical assistance.
