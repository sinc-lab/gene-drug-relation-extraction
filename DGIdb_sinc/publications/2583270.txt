the aim of the present study was to investigate  xxxd2783xxx 
alkaloid effect on: (i) the nonenzymatic
and eef-l-dependent
phe-trnaphc
binding to poly(u)-programmed
human placenta 80 s ribosomes; (ii) diphenylalanine
synthesis accompanying
nonenzymatic
phe-trnaphc binding;
and (iii) acetylphenylalanyl- xxxd3041xxx 
formation.
neither nonenzymatic
nor eef-l-dependent
phe-trnaphe binding were noticeably affected by
the alkaloid, whereas diphenylalanine
synthesis and  xxxd3041xxx  reaction were strongly inhibited by  xxxd2783xxx .
it has been proposed that
the site of  xxxd2783xxx 
binding on 80 s ribosomes should overlap or coincide with the acceptor site of the ribosome.

2. materials

 xxxd2783xxx 
and related alkaloids from
cephalotaxus harringtonia are known to be inhibitors
of protein biosynthesis in some eukaryotic cells. it has
been initially proposed that these compounds inhibit initiation in intact cells and cell lysates [ 1,2]. further investigations clearly showed that such an effect was due
to the prevention of the elongation cycle in contradiction to the previous proposals [3,4]. the results
presented in the above-mentioned works suggested that
cephalotaxus alkaloids inhibited not only peptide bond
formation in the fragment reaction assays but also enzymatic and non-enzymatic
binding of the phetrnaphe to ribosomes. in spite of being widely used in
medicine as antitumour agents these compounds,
however, have hardly been applied to research practice
so far, since the mechanism of their action was not
clear. thus, it seems worthwhile investigating the
mechanism of their inhibition of protein synthesis in
eukaryotic systems, especially in human cells.
in the present paper we have studied an effect of
 xxxd2783xxx  on: (i) nonenzymatic binding of individual phe-trnaphe simultaneously at a and p sites
of poly(u)-programmed
80 s ribosomes from human
placenta and diphenylalanine synthesis under these
conditions; (ii) eef 1-dependent phe-trnaph’ binding
at the ribosomal a site; and (iii) acetylphenylalanylpuromycin formation under treatment of the complex
80 s acphe-trnaph’ poly(u) with  xxxd3041xxx .

and methods

poly(lj) was purchased from  xxxd2177xxx  (hungary);
 xxxd3041xxx 
from
fluka;
[“‘c]phenylalanine
(318 ci/mol)
from
uvvvr
(czechoslovakia).
enriched
[‘4c]phe-trnaphe
(1400 pmol/a2ba
unit) and ac-phe-trnaphc
from e. co/i-mre-600
were prepared as
in [5,6]. eef-lcu from the rabbit liver was kindly given to us by dr
s. tuhachkova.
human placenta ribosomal
subunits were prepared
as described previously [7]. the subunits were reactivated for 10 min
at 37°c in tkm buffer (13 mm mgc12, 0.6 mm edta, 120 mm
kcl, 20 mm tris-hci,
ph 7.5), mixed in the molar ratio of
40 s: 60 s as 1: 1.3. 1 aa60 unit was assumed to be 50 pmol of 40 s
and 25 pmol of 60 s subunits [8]. poly(u)-dependent
nonenzymatic
binding of [‘?j]phe-trnaphe
(7 x lo-’ m, if not indicated otherwise) to 80 s ribosomes (1.65 x lo-’ m) was carried out in tkm buffer for 40 min at 0°c. diphenylalanine
formation
was checked as in
[9]. eef-l-dependent
[‘4c]phe-trnaphe
binding to 80 s ribosomes
was performed in two steps. first, 7 pmol of 80 s ribosomes were incubated with 0.6 4260 unit of e. coli trna and 0.2 asea unit of poly(u) for 5 min at 37°c in tkm buffer to block ribosomal
p site.
second, a ternary complex was obtained by incubation
of 4pg of
eef-lcu, 9 pmol of phe-trnaphe
and 6 nmol of gtp in buffer
(100 mm kcl, 3 mm mgc12, 20 mm tris-hc1, ph 7.5) at 0°c for
15 min. these two complexes were mixed and incubated at 0°c for
15 min. phe-trnaphe binding was tested using nitrocellulose
filtration technique.  xxxd3041xxx  reaction was performed according to [io].
 xxxd2783xxx 
(sigma) was converted to the hcl-form and
dissolved in the tkm buffer. it was used in concentration
10e4 m in
reaction mixtures; the ribosomes were preincubated
with the alkaloid
in the same concentration
(unless otherwise specified) at 2o”c, for
10 min.

3. results and discussion
binding capacity of poly(u)-programmed
80 s
ribosomes was tested by their titration with [14c]phetrnaphe in the absence of translation factors (fig.1).
under the conditions of ribosomal saturation with phetrnaphe, the amount of diphenylalanine formed was
analysed (see table 1).

fig.1. titration of human placenta 80 s ribosomes with [?z]phetrnaphe. (0) with poly(u); (0) without poly(u).

it is seen that the maximum level of poly(u)-directed
phe-trna binding is about 0.7 mol/mol of 80 s
ribosomes (fig. 1). from the data presented in table 1 it
is evident that most parts of the phe residues bound to
the ribosomes participated in (phe)z formation. so, the
majority of active ribosomes bound phe-trnaphe
simultaneously at a and p sites and about 35% of the
ribosomes were active in this binding. at a concentration
of
10m4m  xxxd2783xxx 
does not
significantly affect nonenzymatic phe-trnaphe binding to 80 s ribosomes, but almost completely inhibits
transpeptidation (diphenylalanine formation, see table
1). the alkaloid slightly affects not only nonenzymatic
but also eef-la dependent phe-trnaphe binding (see
table 1).
we have also studied inhibitory action of  xxxd2783xxx  on acetylphenylalanyl- xxxd3041xxx 
formation
when complex 80 s poly(u) ac[14c]phe-trnaphe was
treated with  xxxd3041xxx . the complex was obtained at
relatively low acphe-trnaphe concentration; earlier in
the same system on e. coli ribosomes it was shown that
under such conditions, binding was preferable at the
 xxxd3041xxx -reactive
p site [i 11. as can be seen from
fig.2, acphe- xxxd3041xxx  formation is strongly inhibited
in the case where  xxxd2783xxx  has been added to
the complex 80 s poly(u) acphe-trnaphe upon the adtable 1

the reaction mixture 10 min after  xxxd3041xxx  addition (indicated with
arrow). binding of ac[‘4c]phe-trnaphe (1.6 x lo-’ m) to the 80 s
ribosomes (1.6 x lo-’ m) and poly(u) (5 az60units/ml) was carried
out by incubation of the components in the tm buffer at 20°c for
20 min. the binding level of acphe-trnaphc was about
0.25 mol/mol ribosomes.  xxxd3041xxx  treatment of the complex was
performed at 37°c for 10 min.

dition of  xxxd3041xxx  and is almost completely inhibited
in the case where 80 s ribosomes have been preincubated with the alkaloid before the complex formation.
so,  xxxd2783xxx 
selectively inhibits peptide
bond formation and almost does not hinder codondependent trnaphe binding both nonenzymatically
and eef-l-dependently
at ribosomal a and p sites.
since, the alkaloid inhibits acphe- xxxd3041xxx  formation independently of time of addition, one may suggest that the site of  xxxd2783xxx  binding should
overlap or coincide with the acceptor site of the peptidy1 transferase centre of ribosomes from human
placenta.
the obtained data differ from the results reported
earlier on ribosomes from rabbit reticulocytes [3]. according to [3], cephalotuxus alkaloids prevent not only
transpeptidation but also trna binding to ribosomes
(both nonenzymatic and enzymatic). probably, the
mechanism of the alkaloids’ inhibitory action depends
on the source of ribosomes. but it is more reasonable
to suggest that the observed differences should be due
to different ways of alkaloid dissolution: in [3] it was
dissolved in the form of a base in  xxxd1896xxx 
and this solution was added to ribosomes, while in the
present paper,  xxxd2783xxx 
was converted into
the hcl form in aqueous solution.
there is no set of antibiotics selectively inhibiting
definite steps of the eukaryotic elongation cycle in contrast to prokaryotic one. therefore  xxxd2783xxx 
may be useful as a selective inhibitor of transpeptidation in the studies of different states of trna on
ribosomes in different model systems imitating various
steps of the elongation cycle.
