how many drug targets are there?
john p. overington, bissan al-lazikani and andrew l. hopkins

abstract | for the past decade, the number of molecular targets for approved drugs
has been debated. here, we reconcile apparently contradictory previous reports
into a comprehensive survey, and propose a consensus number of current drug
targets for all classes of approved therapeutic drugs. one striking feature is the
relatively constant historical rate of target innovation (the rate at which drugs
against new targets are launched); however, the rate of developing drugs against
new families is significantly lower. the recent approval of drugs that target protein
kinases highlights two additional trends: an emerging realization of the importance
of polypharmacology, and also the power of a gene-family-led approach in
generating novel and important therapies.
surprisingly, for an industry that spends
in excess of us$50 billion on research and
development each year, there is a lack of
knowledge of the set of molecular targets
that the modern pharmacopoeia acts on.
if we are to develop predictive methods
to identify potential new drug targets, it is
essential that we establish with confidence
the number, characteristics and biological
diversity of targets of approved drugs.
drews and reiser were the first to systematically pose and answer this question, identifying 483 drug targets1,2. later, an analysis by
hopkins and groom challenged this figure
and suggested that ‘rule-of-five’-compliant3
drugs acted primarily through only 120
underlying molecular targets4. subsequently,
in 2003, golden proposed that all thenapproved drugs acted through 273 proteins5,6.
by contrast, wishart et al.7 reported 14,000
targets for all approved and experimental
drugs, although they revise this number
to 6,000 targets on the drugbank database
website. in 2006, imming et al. catalogued
218 molecular targets for approved drug
substances8, whereas zheng et al. disclose 268
‘successful’ targets in the current version of
the therapeutic targets database9,10. here,
we propose a consensus number of 324 drug
targets for all classes of approved therapeutic
drugs (table 1), reconciling earlier reports
into a current and comprehensive survey. the
details of this target list, including the names

of the targets, target class, cellular location
and united states adopted names (usan)
or launch dates, are illustrated in the accompanying poster on the molecular pharmacopoeia (see further information online).
in order to produce this consensus on the
number of molecular targets, a comprehensive analysis of the us fda’s orange book
(for primarily small-molecule drugs) and the
center for biologics evaluation and research
(cber) website (for biological drugs) was
performed. this analysis identifies in excess
of 21,000 drug products; however, when
duplicate active ingredients, salt forms, supplements, vitamins, imaging agents, and so on
are removed, this number is reduced to only
1,357 unique drugs, of which 1,204 are ‘smallmolecule drugs’ and 166 are ‘biological’ drugs.

of the 1,204 small-molecule drugs, 803
can be administered orally, 421 can be dosed
parenterally and 275 can be used as topical
agents (for this analysis, buccal, rectal,
inhalational and other such routes of administration are considered as topical agents).
a further complicating factor in these analyses is that some drugs are dosed as prodrugs.
interestingly, a significant number — at least
192 (16%) — of the small-molecule drugs are
prodrugs. the rule-of-five3 is routinely used
to assess the likelihood of oral absorption for
drugs. in our analysis, 885 of all smallmolecule drugs pass the rule-of-five test;
of these, 619 (70%) are actually dosed orally,
whereas 159 (20%) of orally dosed drugs fail
at least one of the rule-of-five parameters.
assignment of efficacy targets
in order to identify the efficacy targets — the
molecular targets through which the drug
mediates its approved therapeutic activities
— we conducted a comprehensive analysis of
the literature for each drug. the criteria for
assignment was strict in that strong evidence
of cell-based and/or in vivo evidence linking
the target (and specific target sub-type) to
the effect of the drug must exist alongside
binding data. we were able to assign protein
molecular targets believed to be responsible
for the efficacy of a drug to 1,065 of the
unique drugs. where possible, we also
recorded the particular domain in the protein
that binds the drug, as well as the known
binding sites/residues.
the literature is often complex in terms
of the information provided about efficacy
targets. for cases in which a specific target

protein is believed to be the sole or major
route through which a drug achieves its
efficacy, we assign the drug against this single
target; for example, the  xxxg1078xxx 
is believed to be the major mechanistic target
for cetirizine and hydroxyzine, and  xxxd58xxx 
acts through the  xxxg836xxx  adrenoceptor, although all
these drugs show binding to other g-proteincoupled receptors (gpcrs) in in vitro
assays. in other cases, the drug acts through
a number of target subtypes: for example,
carvedilol acts through blocking a number of
alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. finally, a drug can
act through multiple distinct mechanisms,
and therefore unrelated targets. for example,
ritonavir is an hiv protease inhibitor;
however, it is usually given in combination
with other hiv protease inhibitors because it
inhibits the  xxxg590xxx  (cyp3a4)mediated metabolism of other hiv protease
inhibitors such as lopinavir. in such cases,
both hiv1 protease and human cyp3a4 are
regarded as the molecular targets.
there is a relatively small, but clinically
significant, class of drugs that bind to either
ribosomes or dna, or that have no distinct

efficacy targets of current drugs
on the basis of existing knowledge, we were
able to determine that all current drugs with
a known mode-of-action act through 324
distinct molecular drug targets. of these, 266
are human-genome-derived proteins, and
the remainder are bacterial, viral, fungal or
other pathogenic organism targets. smallmolecule drugs modulate 248 proteins, of
which 207 are targets encoded by the human
genome (table 1). oral small-molecule drugs
target 227 molecular targets, of which 186
are human targets.
a complicating feature of any such
analysis is that many drugs have complex
and relatively poorly understood pharmacology, and often limited selectivity against
related proteins, and some targets are
actually complex multimeric proteins with
variable subunit compositions and so on.
if one makes the assumption that proteins
related down to 50% identity show related
pharmacology, then this list of 324 targets
expands to 604 genes for the human genome
(comparison carried out against ensembl
genome june 2006 release containing 29,679
genes). extending the analysis to include all
close homologues (35% identity or closer)
increases the number to 1,048 genes
(3.5% of the genome). this line of reasoning
lead to the initial estimate of the size of the
druggable genome4. understanding the real
pharmacological footprint of current drugs
offers many opportunities for both developing new, optimized agents with different
selectivity profiles, and also more efficient
lead discovery and optimization strategies.
current biological drugs target 76 proteins, with currently marketed monoclonal

antibody therapeutics acting on 15 distinct
human targets. so far, only nine targets are
modulated by both small-molecule and
biological drugs, with the differing agent
types usually targeting different domains
or binding sites. this relatively small
number of jointly modulated targets is
driven by both technical and commercial
considerations. for example, the biological
drugs cetuximab and  xxxd2838xxx  target
the extracellular domain of the receptor
 xxxg2198xxx  egfr ( xxxg682xxx ), whereas
the small-molecule drugs gefitinib and
 xxxd2029xxx  target the adenine portion of the
atp-binding site of the cytosolic catalytic
kinase domain within the same receptor.
drug polypharmacology
it was clear from both our curation of drug
targets from the literature and also datamining of known affinity values of drugs for
targets (as abstracted in a large database of
medicinal chemistry literature17) that many
drugs show clinically relevant polypharmacology (that is, they are ‘dirty drugs18).
quite expectedly, closely related members
of the gene family will show significant drug
promiscuity, and, as a result of the generally
similar function of these proteins, give rise to
complex composite clinical pharmacology.
the point of genuine multitarget effects of
drugs is well illustrated by several recently
launched protein kinase inhibitors. imatinib,
originally developed as a highly selective
inhibitor of c-abl11 (and which target
association led to its first approval for chronic
myeloid leukaemia), has subsequently been
discovered to be have significant activity
against several other clinically relevant
kinases, such as c-kit12–14, leading to expansion of the clinical utility of this important
therapeutic. sorafenib has been recently
launched as an explicit multikinase inhibitor, affecting both tumour proliferation and
tumour angiogenesis pathways, and acting

changes frequently in terms of the knowledge
available about drug indications and mechanisms of action, and so this information
needs to be reviewed regularly.

 xxxg802xxx , platelet-derived growth factor
receptor-beta ( xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx  beta), kit and flt315.
finally, sunitinib is a further recently
approved protein kinase inhibitor with a
similar target footprint to sorafenib12.
at a reductionist level, this polypharmacology can be rationalized by similarities
of key pharmacophores in the binding sites
of proteins from different families16, and,
when comparing proteins from within the
same protein family, polypharmacology
can be rationalized by similarities or differences in the physicochemistry of the
equivalent residues lining the binding site.
the recent work on large-scale mapping of
polypharmacology interactions reveals the
extent of promiscuity of drugs and leads
across the proteome17. placing such aspects
of polypharmacology on a firm practical and
theoretical footing is a major challenge for
the development of future safe and clinically
differentiated therapies17,18.
patterns in drug targets
in order to identify the familial relationships between all drug targets, we analysed
the presence of domains, using the scop19
and pfam20 databases. approximately 130

of family members have been successfully targeted by drugs.
rhodopsin-like gpcrs, certain ion-channel domains and nuclear
receptor ligand-binding domains are clear historical examples
of druggable domains.

polypharmacology
here we use polypharmacology to mean the binding of
a drug to multiple target proteins, with clinical effects
being mediated through the modulation of the set of
protein targets.

drug targets. this number is in stark contrast
to the projected number of protein families
and folds (10,000 folds21 and more than
16,000 families22).
analysis of the gene-family distribution
of targets by drug substance for both smallmolecule and biological drugs (fig. 1) reveals
that more than 50% of drugs target only four
key gene families: class i gpcrs, nuclear
receptors, ligand-gated ion channels and

prodrug
a drug that requires conversion to a more active pharmacological form following dosing. this conversion is often
performed by endogenous enzymes. prodrugs are generally
used to overcome problems with stability, toxicity or often
limited oral bioavailability of the pharmacologically active form.

rule-of-five
poor absorption or permeation of a compound is more likely
when there are >5 hydrogen bond donors, the molecular mass
is >500, clogp is >5, and the sum of nitrogen and oxygen
atoms in a molecule is greater than 10. many drugs, however,
are exceptions to the rule-of-five, and often these are substrates
for biological transporters.

voltage-gated ion channels. the targets with
the most number of drugs approved are the
 xxxg1601xxx  and the histamine
 xxxg1078xxx  (see accompanying poster; also
available online). protein kinases are relatively over-represented considering the small
number of launched drugs against these
targets: there are currently five approved
drugs against the protein catalytic domain,
acting on 18 protein kinases.

perspectives
a common property of most current drug
targets is their cell-surface location: 60% of
drug targets are located at the cell surface,
compared with only ~22% of all proteins in
the human genome. despite this strong pattern of membrane association, there is a high
degree of structural characterization of drug
targets, with 105 drug targets themselves and
over 92% (300) of drug targets being similar
to known proteins in the protein data bank
(pdb)23. although it is still highly debatable
whether useful design and docking can be
performed in all cases, this high structural
coverage clearly illustrates the progress
structural biology has been making in its
application to drug discovery.
the online mendelian inheritance of
man (omim) database24 provides associations between genetic loci and diseases.
a smaller number of disease associations
are linked directly to a specific gene. in an
analysis of these data, 1,620 distinct human
protein sequences are linked directly to a
genetic disease. of these, 105 are drug
targets, corresponding to 47% of human
drug targets that are directly associated with
a disease. in an analysis against an earlier
version of the human genome, only 7%
(1,620 out of 22,218) genes have explicit
disease associations.
the availability of this carefully curated
database allowed us to perform further analyses that address other features of the properties
of marketed small-molecule drugs of broad
relevance. one example is of the potency
distribution of marketed drugs. we identified
binding-affinity-related endpoints for all
drug–efficacy target pairs identified in the
above analyses. the extracted data included all
ic50, ec50, ed50, ki,  xxxg183xxx  and pa2 data; data were
transformed as appropriate onto a log affinity
scale and are detailed in fig. 2. as can be seen,
the median affinity for current small-molecule
drugs is around 20 nm.
one striking feature of the analysis is
how infrequent it is for new protein domains
to join the exclusive drugged domain
set. using the same dataset analysed by a
recent national institute for health care
management research and educational
foundation (nihcm foundation) study
examining drug innovation25, of 361 new
molecular entities (nmes) approved by the
fda between 1989 and 2000, 76% targeted
a precedented drugged domain and only 6%
targeted a previously undrugged domain; the
remainder have either unknown targets (4%)
or are believed not to have distinct molecular
targets underlying their action (17%).
analysis of the rate of target innovation is
shown in fig. 3. as can be seen, the rate

is surprisingly constant over the past 20 years,
with an average rate of first-against-target
drugs of 5.3 new ‘drugged’ targets per year,
although over individual years the rate is
quite variable. the recent set of multikinasetargeted drugs are clearly a significant modern
pattern, following the 2001 launch of imatinib.
the first approved indications for drugs acting on the new drug targets are commonly
orphan diseases, suggesting that innovation
primarily occurs at the edges of the market
(as is typical behaviour of innovation in other
industries26), whereas innovations in the
major disease indications can occur as rarely
as once a decade, owing to the challenge of
showing superior safety and efficacy profiles
over existing therapies with very large and
costly outcome-based clinical trials.

concluding thoughts
it is clear from this work, and the recent
work of others, that despite the huge efforts
and resources aligned to drug discovery
as a commercial process, there is relatively
little publicly accessible data addressing the
fundamental question of how current drugs
work. we hope this perspective helps address
some of the issues surrounding our current
knowledge of the complexities of drug action,
and also provides a useful assembly of data
that could only have been achieved through
careful consolidation of literature, and other
disparate data sources. given this collection
of historical drug targets, it is now possible to
start to address the development of computer-based approaches to rationally score and
assess the likely success of future drug targets.
it is tempting to see advances in technology
as transforming the rate of innovation in
discovery, but there has been little evidence
of technological developments to date
improving our ability to tackle new target
classes with increasing speed and success,
and it would seem that small, incremental
changes and hard-won gains in fundamental
biology and chemistry, and clinical science,
is still state of the art. as james black is
famously quoted as saying: “the most fruitful
basis for the discovery of a new drug is to
start with an old drug”27.
