abstract
the two active sites of dimeric  xxxd148xxx  synthase (alas), a pyridoxal 5⬘-phosphate (plp)dependent enzyme, are located on the subunit interface with contribution of essential amino acids from each
subunit. linking the two subunits into a single polypeptide chain dimer (2xalas) yielded an enzyme with
an approximate sevenfold greater turnover number than that of wild-type alas. spectroscopic and kinetic
properties of 2xalas were investigated to explore the differences in the coenzyme structure and kinetic
mechanism relative to those of wild-type alas that confer a more active enzyme. the absorption spectra
of both alas and 2xalas had maxima at 410 and 330 nm, with a greater a410/a330 ratio at ph ∼7.5 for
2xalas. the 330 nm absorption band showed an intense fluorescence at 385 nm but not at 510 nm,
indicating that the 330 nm absorption species is the substituted aldamine rather than the enolimine form of
the schiff base. the 385 nm emission intensity increased with increasing ph with a single pk of ∼8.5 for
both enzymes, and thus the 410 and 330 nm absorption species were attributed to the ketoenamine and
substituted aldamine, respectively. transient kinetic analysis of the formation and decay of the quinonoid
intermediate eq2 indicated that, although their rates were similar in alas and 2xalas, accumulation of
this intermediate was greater in the 2xalas-catalyzed reaction. collectively, these results suggest that
ketoenamine is the active form of the coenzyme and forms a more prominent coenzyme structure in
2xalas than in alas at ph ∼7.5.

heme is an essential tetrapyrrole in nearly all living cells. it
is the prosthetic group of oxygen carrying molecules (e.g.,
hemoglobins), gas-sensing receptors (e.g., the bacterial
fixl and cooa receptors), electron transport proteins (e.g.,
cytochromes), drug-metabolizing enzymes (cytochromes
p450, peroxidases), and many other enzymes (e.g., no synthases, guanylyl cyclases, catalases).  xxxd148xxx 
synthase (alas) (ec 2.3.1.37) catalyzes the first and regulatory step in heme biosynthesis in mammalian cells. in this
step, glycine is condensed with succinyl  xxxd1739xxx  (coa)
yielding  xxxd148xxx  (ala), coa, and carbon dioxide (ahktar and jordan 1979; ferreira and gong 1995; ferreira 1999). in humans, of the two genes that encode the two

alas isoforms, housekeeping or  xxxg122xxx  (bishop et al.
1990) and erythroid-specific or  xxxg123xxx  (cotter et al. 1992),
mutations in the  xxxg123xxx  gene appear to be responsible for
the erythropoietic disorder, x-linked sideroblastic anemia
(bottomley 1999). in addition, reduced hemoglobin synthesis, characteristic of other anemias, may also be associated
with decreased alas activity, as in chronic anemia of rheumatoid arthritis (houston et al. 1994).
alas requires pyridoxal 5⬘-phosphate (plp) as an essential cofactor (ferreira 1999) and has been classified in
the ␣-oxoamine synthase subfamily (alexeev et al. 1998;
ikushiro et al. 2001; schmidt et al. 2001) and within the
␣-family of plp-dependent enzymes (alexander et al.
1994) or within class ii of fold type i of the plp-dependent
enzyme superfamily (schneider et al. 2000). the mechanistic information about alas indicates that the stereospecific
removal of the pro-r proton of the plp-glycine external
aldimine yields a carbanion (i.e., a transient quinonoid intermediate), which then condenses with succinyl-coa
(zaman et al. 1973; hunter and ferreira 1999a,b; zhang and
ferreira 2002). briefly, the catalytic pathway of alas
comprises the following steps (scheme 1): (1) association of
the glycine substrate with the enzyme, forming the michaelis complex (ii); (2) formation of the external aldimine (iii)
(i.e., transaldimination); (3) formation of the quinonoid in-

termediate eq1 (iv) by abstraction of the ␣-proton from the
plp-glycine external aldimine; (4) condensation of
the succinyl-coa substrate (v); (5) release of coa from
the tetrahedral intermediate; (6) decarboxylation of the generated ␣-amino-␤-ketoadipate-alas aldimine (vi) with
formation of a second quinonoid intermediate (eq2) (vii);
(7) protonation of the quinonoid intermediate to form the
ala-alas aldimine (viii); (8) release of ala and restoration of the internal aldimine (i) (transaldimination)
(hunter and ferreira 1999b; zhang and ferreira 2002)
(scheme 1).
similar to other fold type i plp-dependent enzymes,
alas functions as a homodimer with two active sites per
dimer (eliot and kirsch 2004). the active sites are located
on the dimer interface and comprise residues from each
monomer (tan and ferreira 1996). k313 (murine  xxxg123xxx 
numbering) (schoenhaut and curtis 1986) forms a schiff
base linkage with the plp cofactor (ferreira et al. 1993) and
is likely to have a catalytic role (hunter and ferreira 1999a).
the negatively charged side chain of  xxxd279xxx  maintains a
hydrogen bond/salt bridge with the protonated pyridine nitrogen of the plp cofactor (gong et al. 1998), thus enhancing the electron withdrawing character of the plp cofactor
as observed in other fold type i plp-dependent enzymes
(e.g., aspartate aminotransferase [yano et al. 1993], trypto-

recently, the construction of a “single-chain dimeric”
alas (i.e., 2xalas), which involved the linkage of the
two murine erythroid-specific alas monomeric units, resulted in a functional, monomeric enzyme with distinct
spectroscopic properties and substantially greater enzymatic
activity than wild-type murine erythroid-specific alas
(cheltsov et al. 2001, 2003). in this study, we examine the
differences, at the coenzyme structure and mechanistic levels, between murine erythroid-specific alas and 2xalas
that confer an increased turnover to 2xalas.
results and discussion
as with many other plp-dependent enzymes (e.g., li et al.
1997; alexeev et al. 1998; morollo et al. 1999; eliot and
kirsch 2004; paiardini et al. 2004) the two active sites of the
alas homodimer are located at the subunit interface, and
amino acids from both subunits contribute to the architecture of the active sites (tan and ferreira 1996). the design
of an expression vector with two in-tandem cdnas of murine erythroid-specific alas led to the synthesis of a monomeric protein corresponding to the two linked alas subunits, in other words, a single-chain dimer (cheltsov et al.
2001, 2003). this protein (2xalas) did not only exhibit
alas activity but, intriguingly, at 20°c, it also had kcat and
kcat/ks−coa
values about 7- and 117-fold greater, respecm
tively, than those of alas (table 1). a similar trend was
observed at 30°c, although with lower enhancements
(table 1). in the present work, we analyzed the spectroscopic and kinetic (transient and steady-state) properties of
alas and 2xalas to begin to unravel the possible
mechanism whereby enzymatic activity is enhanced by linking the two alas subunits.

spectroscopic properties of 2xalas: cd
and uv-visible absorption and fluorescence
functional alas and 2xalas have practically the same
molecular mass (i.e., ∼110 kda) as the two alas subunits
(each 56 kda) are “cross-linked” in 2xalas. the crosslink resulted from an engineered dna construct in which
two alas cdnas were concatamerized and not from protein chemical cross-linking (cheltsov et al. 2001, 2003).
thus, the amino acid compositions of alas and 2xalas
are essentially the same, except for the two extra amino
acids (gln and leu), corresponding to the gln-leu crosslink-encoding sequence, which were introduced into
2xalas with the construction of an mfei site (5⬘caattg-3⬘) between the sequences of the two alas
cdnas in the 2xalas-expression plasmid (cheltsov et al.
2001). further, while sds-page indicated  xxxg220xxx  of 56
kda and ∼110 kda for alas and 2xalas, respectively,
gel-filtration chromatography yielded stokes radii results
agreeable with ∼112 kda for both functional alas and
2xalas (cheltsov et al. 2003). the structural content and
overall conformation of 2xalas, as verified by cd, are
identical to those of the wild-type enzyme (fig. 1a), suggesting that the “linking” of the two subunits did not introduce drastic alterations in the secondary structure of the
protein. the ␧-amino group of k313 of murine erythroid
alas forms a schiff base with the plp carbonyl group
yielding the absorption maximum at ∼410 nm (ferreira and
dailey 1993; ferreira et al. 1993), which is typically observed with plp-dependent enzymes at neutral ph (kallen
et al. 1985; li et al. 1997; ikushiro et al. 1998; bertoldi et
al. 2002). similar to alas, the absorption spectrum of
2xalas exhibited maxima at 410 and 330 nm (fig. 1b).
however, while the absorbance band at 410 nm was much
more pronounced, the absorbance band at 330 nm was less
defined in 2xalas (with a410/a330 of 0.684 and 0.380 for
2xalas and alas at ph 7.5, respectively) (fig. 1b).
with other plp-dependent enzymes, the 420 nm-absorption
species is generally attributed to the ketoenamine form of
the internal aldimine (ahmed et al. 1996; li et al. 1997;

ikushiro et al. 1998; zhou and toney 1999) (fig. 1c), but
the assignment of the 330 nm-absorption species is less
straightforward, as several potential structures have the
same absorption maximum. among the potential structures
for the 330 nm-absorption species are an aldimine form in
which the pyridinium nitrogen is deprotonated, a substituted
aldamine (fig. 1c) and an enolimine tautomer (fig. 1c).
deprotonation of the pyridinium nitrogen is an unlikely
event for several reasons. if deprotonation were to occur, an
absorption maximum at 360 nm should be observed, which
is not the case in the alas spectra. in alas and other fold
type i plp-dependent enzymes (e.g., aspartate aminotrans-

ferase [yano et al. 1993], 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase [toney et al. 1993] and 2-amino- xxxd64xxx  coa
ligase [schmidt et al. 2001]), a hydrogen bond/salt bridge is
maintained between the protonated pyridine nitrogen of the
plp cofactor and the negatively charged side chain of an
active-site aspartate residue. the aspartate residue in murine
erythroid alas is  xxxd279xxx , which has been shown to have an
essential role in catalysis by stabilizing protonation of the
pyridinium ring nitrogen and thus enhancing the electron
withdrawing properties of the plp cofactor (gong et al.
1998). this interaction is believed to increase dramatically
the intrinsic pk value of the ring nitrogen (gloss and kirsch

1995), rendering the possibility of deprotonation of the pyridinium nitrogen of alas-bound plp remote. thus, to elucidate which structure, the enolimine tautomer or the substituted aldamine, is associated with the 330 nm-absorption
species, we turned to fluorescence spectroscopy.
alas and 2xalas emitted fluorescence maxima at 385
and 518 nm upon excitation at 331 and 436 nm, respectively
(fig. 2a–d). (similar emission spectra, with a maximum at
515 nm, were obtained upon excitation at 420 nm; data not
shown.) when 2xalas fluorescence was monitored at 385
and 518 nm, the excitation spectra exhibited maxima at 331
and 436 nm, respectively, corresponding to the absorption
maxima of 2xalas. however, a second maximum (at 331
nm) in the excitation spectra of alas was observed when
the fluorescence was monitored at 518 nm. alas fluorescence intensity was higher at 385 nm than at 518 nm in the
alkaline ph region, although the fluorescence intensity at
these wavelengths and ph was similar for 2xalas (fig.
2e,f). emission fluorescence intensity at 518 nm increased
and that at 385 nm decreased with decreasing ph for both
alas and 2xalas. indeed, the 385 nm emission fluorescence intensity increased with increasing ph with a single
pk of 8.44 ± 0.08 and 8.55 ± 0.10 for alas and 2xalas,
respectively (fig. 2). it has been shown that a substituted
aldamine exhibits a fluorescence maximum intensity at
∼390 nm upon excitation at ∼330 nm (hayashi et al. 1993;
ikushiro et al. 1998; bertoldi et al. 2002), while an enolimine tautomer displays a fluorescence emission maximum
at ∼515 nm (ikushiro et al. 1998; bertoldi et al. 2002).
excitation of a substituted aldamine at 330 nm results in an
emission band at ∼390 nm (and not at ∼515 nm) because of
the lack of double bonds conjugated with the pyridinium
ring (ikushiro et al. 1998). these results are consistent with
the assignment of a substituted aldamine (and not an enolimine) structure for the 330 nm-absorption band of alas
(or 2xalas), although the nature of the nucleophile involved in the formation of the adduct remains to be investigated.
taken together, the differences between the absorption
and fluorescence spectra of alas and 2xalas most
likely reflect a slightly different nature of the active sites. it
appears that the “linking” of the two alas subunits did not
affect the global conformation of alas but affected the
environment of the plp cofactor—mirrored by the change
in the predominant tautomeric form of the internal aldimine.
steady-state kinetic behavior
the variation of the kinetic parameters of alas and
2xalas with ph is illustrated in figure 3. despite the
greater turnover numbers for 2xalas in relation to those
of wild-type alas, the ph-rate profiles for the reactions
catalyzed by alas and 2xalas are similar (fig. 3a–c).
log kcat decreases with increasing ph with a pka of
1194

protein science, vol. 14

8.79 ± 0.03 and of 8.65 ± 0.04 for alas and 2xalas,
respectively (fig. 3a). the kcat/kgly
m -ph profile decreased
on the acid and basic sides with limiting slopes of 1 and −1,
indicating that the ionization of two groups is relevant to the
enzymatic reaction, with one being protonated and the other
unprotonated (fig. 3b). however, a fit of the kcat/kgly
m data
using equation 2 indicated that the pka values were very
close to one another (less than 0.16 and 0.69 ph units for
alas and 2xalas, respectively) and therefore the same
pka was assumed for both groups, i.e., a pka value of 8.6 for
alas and 2xalas (fig. 3b). nevertheless, this pka value
appears to be similar to that controlling the kcat. variation
with ph of pkgly
m yielded a pka value of ∼8.6 (fig. 3c),
which likely represents the pka of a group in the free enzyme, given that glycine does not ionize in the ph range
studied and is not a sticky substrate (cleland 1977).
besides the involvement in the schiff base linkage with
the plp cofactor, a catalytic role for k313 was previously
advanced (hunter and ferreira 1999a). we proposed that
k313 could act as a general base catalyst to remove the
pro-r proton of glycine and as a general acid to donate a
proton to the quinonoid intermediate, eq2 (scheme 1)
(hunter and ferreira 1999a). in fact, we determined that a
pka of ∼8.1 was associated with the titration of eq2 formed
upon the reaction of ala with alas (hunter and ferreira
1999a). the kinetic pkas reflected in the kcat/km versus ph
profiles for alas (and 2xalas) (fig. 3b) are consistent
with that determined by titration and with k313 being involved in the abstraction of the proton from the ␣-position
of glycine to afford the quinonoid intermediate, eq1
(scheme 1). on the other hand, although the spectral titrations of the free enzymes, which were the basis for the
proposed structures of the coenzyme in alas and 2xalas
(ketoenamine and substituted aldamine) (fig. 1c) yielded
pkas of ∼8.4 and ∼8.5 for alas and 2xalas, respectively
(fig. 2e–f), we believe that this equilibrium does not reflect
the protonation state of the iminic nitrogen, but instead it
reflects the structural change of the internal aldimine (see
below). a second ionizing group could not be distinguished
in the kcat/kgly
m -ph profiles (fig. 3b), and while kinetics
cannot elucidate how the michaelis complex is formed, it is
expected that, given the pka of the ␣-nh3+ of glycine (i.e.,
9.6), the amino group of glycine would have to be deprotonated before the transaldimination reaction could occur.
the unprotonated phenolate oxygen of the plp cofactor and
the imidazole nitrogen of h282 have been advanced among
the possible candidates in the proton abstraction (zhang and
ferreira 2002).

subsequent turnovers were at a rate 0.09 ± 0.01 sec−1, in
agreement with the independently determined steady-state
rate (kcat ⳱ 0.11 ± 0.02) (table 1). the pre-steady-state
burst (fig. 4) indicates that the rate-limiting step occurs
after the chemical step, which, as with alas, we assign to
ala release (hunter and ferreira 1999b; zhang and ferreira 2002). it appears that while the rate-determining step
remained the same in the 2xalas reaction, the extent of
the catalytically competent species, judging from the burst
amplitudes, increased in 2xalas (i.e., burst amplitudes of
0.49 and 0.12/active site [hunter and ferreira 1999b; zhang
and ferreira 2002] for 2xalas and alas, respectively).
the amplitude of the burst corresponds to the amount of
e · gly
species
in
the
preincubated
solution
(e + gly
e · gly) that is catalytically active. thus, an approximate fourfold increase in the amplitude of the burst
suggests a greater proportion of catalytic active species in
2xalas than in alas. this enhancement is consistent
with the observed increase in the quinonoid intermediate
concentration (fig. 5) and correlates with the ketoenamine
as the major 2xalas coenzyme form (fig. 1b).
moreover, a similar correlation was observed when the
formation of the quinonoid intermediate (eq2) in the alas
and 2xalas-catalyzed reactions was monitored using
rapid scanning stopped-flow spectroscopy. previously, using rapid scanning stopped-flow spectroscopy and single
turnover conditions, we demonstrated that the catalytic reaction of alas involves the formation of two quinonoid
reaction intermediates (scheme 1); the first one, eq1, is
formed very rapidly (within the dead-time of the instrument,

i.e., 2 msec) (zhang and ferreira 2002), and the second one,
eq2, a relatively stable quinonoid intermediate, is formed

with an estimated rate of ∼5 sec−1 (hunter and ferreira
1999b; zhang and ferreira 2002). when either alas (50
␮m) or 2xalas (12.5 ␮m), preincubated with glycine
(200 mm), was reacted with succinyl-coa (120 ␮m), a
510-nm absorbing species, corresponding to the quinonoid
intermediate eq2, accumulated (fig. 5a,b). although the
rates of formation and decay of the intermediate into the
steady-state were similar for alas and 2xalas, the concentration of the transiently accumulated quinonoid species
was approximately 4.1-fold greater in the 2xalas-catalyzed reaction (fig. 5c). this was in agreement with
the enhancement observed in the burst amplitude for the
2xalas reaction.
in several other plp-dependent enzymes, including  xxxg2256xxx  (morino and snell 1967; ikushiro et al. 1998) and
cystalysin (bertoldi et al. 2002), the ∼420 nm-absorption
species, ascribed to the ketoenamine form of the schiff base
of plp with the active-site lysine residue, has been found to
be the active form of the enzyme that reacts with the substrate (ikushiro et al. 1998).  xxxg2256xxx  represents a
remarkable example of how, in a given ph range, a plpdependent enzyme can be catalytically active in spite of the
inactive form of the free enzyme being the major species
(ikushiro et al. 1998). indeed,  xxxg2256xxx  is more catalytically competent at alkaline ph (morino and snell 1967;
ikushiro et al. 1998), where the 338 nm-absorbing species,
a catalytically incompetent, substituted aldamine structure,
predominates (morino and snell 1967; ikushiro et al. 1998).
the enzyme overcomes this apparent conundrum by converting the structure of its coenzyme from the 338 nmabsorbing species to the ∼420-absorbing species in an early
step of the reaction cycle (ikushiro et al. 1998). the binding
of the substrate to  xxxg2256xxx  has been postulated to
promote the conversion of the substituted aldamine structure of the coenzyme into the ketoenamine structure and
active form of the enzyme. this active form can then undergo transaldimination with the substrate amino group to
give the external aldimine necessary for subsequent catalysis (ikushiro et al. 1998). specifically, the electrostatic interaction between the coenzyme and the ligand was proposed to induce the removal of the nucleophilic group from
the  xxxg2256xxx  tetrahedral adduct (ikushiro et al. 1998).
although the mechanism involved in the activation of the
cystalysin coenzyme remains to be elucidated, bertoldi et
al. (2002) proposed that a small and localized ligand-induced conformational change of the enzyme could be another plausible explanation to account for the transition between the inactive, substituted aldamine and the active, ketoenamine structure. whether binding of glycine to alas
and 2xalas causes a shift between two (active and inactive) forms of the coenzyme and even if observed, whether
the degree of coenzyme conversion differs in alas and
2xalas, remain to be elucidated. however, it seems clear
that the rate of the reaction is dependent on the proportion

of active sites initially in the ketoenamine form, and this is
greater in 2xalas at ph values ∼7.5. if it is a conformational change of the enzyme associated with ala release
that limits turnover, then linking the n and c termini in
2xalas may result in strain that lowers the energy barrier
for interconversion of the enzyme between different conformations required for ala formation and release. it is
also conceivable that the linked structure of 2xalas better
accommodates the succinyl-coa substrate, as reflected by
value for 2xalas than
the 5- to 17.5-fold lower ks−coa
m
alas (i.e., determinations at 30°c and 20°c, table 1).
questions related to the nuances of the succinyl-coa-binding site in alas and 2xalas and the nature of the nucleophile proposed to form an adduct with the plp-lys313
aldimine will require the determination of the three-dimensional structures of alas and 2xalas, particularly at
high ph for the identification of the structure of the nucleophile. crystallization studies of alas and 2xalas are in
progress. enhancing the specific activity of alas will be
relevant in the development of novel alas variants of
biotechnological interest, as alas controls the rate-limiting step of heme biosynthesis. to our knowledge, this is the
first example of creating a more active enzyme by just linking its monomeric subunits and raises the possibility of
enhancing the activity of enzymes with product release as
the rate-limiting step by simply controlling the degree of
protein domain movement.
in summary, our data provide evidence that, at neutral
ph, the ketoenamine is a more predominant coenzyme
structure in the free 2xalas than in alas. although the
rates associated with the formation and decay of the quinonoid intermediate eq2 are similar for alas and 2xalas,
the amplitude of this intermediate in the steady-state increased and an enhanced burst of ala formation and ala
release were observed in the 2xalas-catalyzed reaction.
these factors probably account for the increased turnover
number of 2xalas.

overexpression, purification, and steady-state
kinetic analyses of alas and 2xalas
recombinant wild-type murine erythroid alas and 2xalas
were overproduced and purified from escherichia coli dh5␣ and
bl21(de3) cells harboring pgf23 (ferreira and dailey 1993) and
 xxxg71xxx  (cheltsov et al. 2003), alas- and 2xalas-overexpression plasmids, respectively, as previously described (cheltsov et
al. 2003). (the sequence for 2xalas corresponds to that of two
tandem alas cdnas linked through an mfei site [cheltsov et al.
2001]). the purified proteins (either alas or 2xalas) were
concentrated by pressurized dialysis in an amicon 8050 stir cell
equipped with a ym30 membrane. the concentrated, purified proteins were stored under liquid nitrogen until needed.

protein concentration determination and sds-page
protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid
assay, according to the instructions supplied with the protein concentration determination kit (sigma chemical co.), and using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as standard. alas and 2xalas concentrations are reported based on  xxxg220xxx  molecular mass of 56,000 da
and 112,000 da, respectively. protein purity was assessed by sodium  xxxd3215xxx -polyacylamide gel electrophoresis (laemmli
1970).

uv/visible absorption and fluorescence
spectroscopic measurements
all uv/vis absorption spectra were obtained with a shimadzu
uv2100u uv/vis dual beam spectrophotometer. this spectrophotometer is equipped with thermostatically controlled cell holders
and allows the exporting of data as ascii files through the rs232
interface. alas activity was measured using a continuous spectrophotometric assay according to a previously described method
(hunter and ferreira 1995). fluorescence spectra were collected
on a shimadzu rf-5301 pc spectrofluorophotometer. spectra of
blanks, i.e., of samples containing all component except alas (or
2xalas), were taken immediately prior to measurements of
samples containing protein. blank spectra were subtracted from
spectra of samples containing enzyme. before spectra were acquired, the enzymes were passed through a pd-10 (pharmacia) gel
filtration column equilibrated with 20 mm potassium phosphate
(ph 7.5), containing 10% glycerol, to remove free plp.

alas and 2xalas were determined at ph 7.5 and either 20°c or

of the substrates were varied (in matrices of six glycine and six
succinyl-coa concentrations), and the observed rates were fitted
to the hyperbolic form of the michaelis-menten equation (equation 1) with sigmaplot (version 7.0):

a circulating water bath, controlled thermostatically at 30°c, was
used to maintain the temperature of the loading syringes containing the reactants and the stopped-flow cell compartment. reactant
concentrations in the two loading syringes were twofold greater
than the final concentrations in the observation chamber. the reaction buffer for the experiments was 50 mm hepes (ph 7.5),
containing 10% glycerol. time course data were fitted using
single-wavelength analysis to the minimum number of exponentials required to obtain a good fit, i.e., the data were fitted to
equation 5 for one to three exponentials using the program provided by olis, where at is the absorbance at time t, a is the
amplitude of each phase, k is the observed rate for each phase, and
