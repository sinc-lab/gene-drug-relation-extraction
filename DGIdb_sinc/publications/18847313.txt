expert opinion

stem cells harvested from peripheral blood are the most commonly used
graft source in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. while g-csf is the
most frequently used agent for stem cell mobilization, the use of g-csf
alone results in suboptimal stem cell yields in a significant proportion of
patients undergoing autologous transplantation.  xxxd2974xxx  (amd3100,
genzyme corporation) is a  xxxd2974xxx  molecule that antagonizes the binding
of the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (sdf-1) to its cognate receptor
cxcr4.  xxxd2974xxx  results in the rapid and reversible mobilization of
hematopoietic stem cells into the peripheral circulation and is synergistic
when combined with g-csf. in clinical studies of autologous stem cell
transplantation, the combination of  xxxd2974xxx  and g-csf allows the collection
of large numbers of stem cells in fewer apheresis sessions and can salvage
those who fail g-csf mobilization alone.

introduction

approximately 35,000 autologous and 20,000 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplants (hscts) are currently performed worldwide each year to treat a
variety of malignant and nomalignant conditions. in an autologous transplant,
collection and reinfusion of a patient’s own hematopoietic stem cells (hscs)
allows the administration of higher doses of chemotherapy to maximize tumor
kill in which myelosuppression would otherwise be dose limiting. in an allogeneic
transplant, transplantation of hscs from a sibling or unrelated donor source
can both replace defective hematopoiesis and allow for a potent antitumor
effect mediated by donor lymphocytes. currently non-hodgkin’s lymphoma
(nhl) and multiple myeloma (mm) are the most common indications for
autologous transplantation and acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome for
allogeneic transplantation.
while bone marrow historically has been used as the source of hematopoietic
stem cells (hscs) used in transplantation, hscs can also be recruited into the
peripheral circulation following the administration of chemotherapy and/or cytokines
in a process termed stem cell mobilization. following mobilization, these cells
may be collected via large-volume apheresis techniques in numbers sufficient for
use in hsct. compared to bone marrow, use of peripheral blood stem cells
(pbscs) in hsct results in more rapid hematological reconstitution, reduced
hospitalization costs and avoidance of the risks of general anesthesia and discomfort
associated with a bone marrow harvest [1-3]. because of these advantages, the
use of pbscs as a stem cell source continues to increase such that more

than 95% of autologous transplants and 75% of allogeneic
stem cell transplants in adults are currently being performed
with pbscs.

1.1

overview of stem cell mobilization

hscs reside in the marrow in a highly organized
microenvironment consisting of marrow stromal cells,
osteoblasts, osteoclasts and their associated extracellular matrix
proteins. hematopoiteic cells express a number of critical
adhesion molecules, such as cxc motif, receptor 4 (cxcr4),
very late activation protein 4 ( xxxg1203xxx ) and  xxxg1279xxx , which
allow these cells to interact with the cellular and extracellular
components of the microenvironment. hscs also normally
circulate at low levels in the peripheral blood but are
increased in response to stressors such infection, trauma or
chemotherapy. in addition, a number of different cytokines
(g-csf, gm-csf and stem cell factor), chemokines [il-8,
stromal cell-derived factor-1 (sdf-1) and growth regulated
protein beta (grobeta)] or antibodies to adhesion molecules
[ xxxg1203xxx  and  xxxg2406xxx  ( xxxg2406xxx )]
can mobilize stem cells into the peripheral circulation [4].
the interaction of sdf-1 ( xxxg560xxx ) with its cognate receptor,
cxcr4 plays a critical role in the retention of hscs in the
bone marrow. sdf-1 is a cxc chemokine, which is
constitutively expressed in bone marrow stroma and functions
as a chemoattractant of hematopoietic stem and progenitor
cells. while the precise mechanisms by which agents can
mobilize hscs has not been fully elucidated, it is known
that g-csf can reduce sdf-1 protein levels by downrgulation
of sdf-1 mrna levels in osteoblasts or by proteolytic cleavage
of adhesion molecules by neutrophil-derived proteases such as
 xxxg1440xxx  and  xxxg694xxx  which are
released into the marrow space [5].
1.2

methods of stem cell mobilization

the optimal method for mobilizing stem cells is unknown.
while a number of different agents can mobilize hscs,
only g-csf ( xxxd2106xxx , neupogen®, amgen), gm-csf
( xxxg526xxx , leukine®, bayer healthcare pharmaceuticals)
and stem cell factor (ancestim, stemgen®, amgen, available
in canada only) are approved clinically for use in stem cell
mobilization. the most commonly used agent, g-csf,
is typically administered at a dose of 10 µg/kg daily by
subcutaneous (sq) injection which produces a 10 – 100-fold
increase in circulating hscs peaking at 5 days post
administration [6-8]. for autologous donors, g-csf may
be administered alone or during the recovery phase of
chemotherapy. hscs can then be harvested via large-volume
apheresis over consecutive days until the desired numbers of
stem cells are collected. g-csf is generally well tolerated
with nausea and bone pain being the most common side
effects. in addition, splenic rupture has been reported as a
rare complication [9,10]. gm-csf and scf are modest stem
cell mobilizing agents on their own but have been used in
combination with g-csf [11-15].
1798

the enumeration of cells that express the cell surface
marker cd34 present on hematopoietic stem and progenitor
cells is used to assess the adequacy of stem cell numbers for
hsct. although no absolute thresholds exists, a minimum
of 2.0 × 106 cd34+ cells/kg body weight is used by
many centers to ensure adequate neutrophil recovery post
transplant [16]. in addition, 5.0 × 106 cd34+ cells/kg has
been considered by some to be the optimal target as it
results in faster platelet recovery post transplant [17-19].
although chemotherapy plus g-csf can produce higher
stem cell yields, this approach is associated with increased
morbidity due to infectious complications from chemotherapy,
is more resource intensive because of variability in the
timing of stem cell collection, and has not been associated
with improved clinical outcomes [20,21].
while failure to collect adequate numbers of hscs from
allogeneic donors is rare, currently used mobilization regimens
are associated with failure rates estimated at between
5 and 30% in autologous donors [18,22]. we have recently
reviewed our institutional experience at washington university
and found that ∼ 25% of patients with hodgkins and
non-hodgkins lymphomas and 7% of patients with multiple
myeloma fail to mobilize a minimum number of 2.0 × 106
cd34+ cells required for transplantation in five apheresis
sessions following g-csf only mobilization (unpublished
results). a number of factors for poor mobilization have
been identified including the cumulative dose and type
of chemotherapy, prior radiation therapy, older age and
the extent of marrow involvement in the underlying
disease [19,22].
for patients who fail their initial mobilization, no
uniform strategy exists for remobilization. options include
remobilization with the same regimen, dose escalation
of g-csf, combining g-csf with gm-csf, scf or
chemotherapy or bone marrow harvest of stem cells [23,24].
despite these strategies, ∼ 30% of patients requiring
remobilization will still not achieve a minimum cd34
collection for transplantation. even in those patients who do
collect sufficient hscs, transplantation with suboptimal
numbers may lead to prolonged hospitalization, increased
transfusion requirements and higher patient morbidity.

 xxxd2974xxx  (amd3100)

 xxxd2974xxx  (genzyme) is a  xxxd2974xxx  molecule (figure 1) which
binds reversibly to cxcr4. in addition to its role in hsc
homing and retention in the bone marrow, cxcr4 functions
as a co-receptor for entry of t-cell-tropic hiv strains into
cd4+ t cells.  xxxd2974xxx  was initially developed as a potential
therapeutic agent against hiv based on preclinical data
that demonstrated potent and selective inhibition of hiv
replication by blocking entry via the cxcr4 coreceptor [25,26].
 xxxd2974xxx  blocks sdf-1 binding of cxcr4 and inhibits
sdf-1-induced calcium flux and chemotaxis [27].  xxxd2974xxx 
is highly specific for cxcr4 and has no detectable agonist

2.1 preclinical and phase i studies in normal
volunteers and hiv patients

during the initial phase i study of  xxxd2974xxx  in normal
human volunteers, it was observed that subjects developed a
reversible dose-dependent leukocytosis that peaked 6 h post
injection returning to baseline at approximately 24 h [29]. a
phase i study of continuous intravenous dosing of from 2.5
to 160 µg/kg/h  xxxd2974xxx  in hiv patients was also
conducted but was halted at the 160 µg/kg/h dose because
of two patients having unexpected but asymptomatic premature
ventricular contractions. although minimal effects were seen
on hiv viral loads, all patients also experienced a peripheral
leukocytosis of up to 3.4 times baseline [30]. based on these
initial studies, it was determined that the amount and
volume of  xxxd2974xxx  required to achieve an antiviral effect
against cxcr4 could not be achieved and its clinical
development as a hiv drug was halted. with the initial
observations of leukocytosis and emerging evidence for the
critical role of the cxcr4–sdf-1 axis in regulating stem
cell trafficking, development of  xxxd2974xxx  was refocused on
its potential effects on hsc mobilization.
liles et al. conducted a phase i study in 26 healthy
volunteers to examine stem cell mobilization in which
 xxxd2974xxx  was administered via subcutaneous injection. at
the highest dose tested, 240 µg/kg, a single dose of  xxxd2974xxx 
caused a generalized leukocytosis with 10-fold increase in
peripheral blood cd34+ cells at 9 h following sq injection
which gradually returned to baseline by ∼ 24 h after
administration [31].
although, cd34+ cell number is a useful surrogate for stem
cells, definitive proof of the ability to mobilize hsc came
from murine experiments testing for functional hematopoietic
stem cells.  xxxd2974xxx  was found to mobilize functional hscs
which provided long-term repopulation in lethally-irradiated
mice, and human cd34+ cells that can repopulate irradiated
nonobese diabetic- xxxg1176xxx 
mice [32]. in these experiments,  xxxd2974xxx  was also noted to
act synergistically when combined with g-csf in the

mobilization of hscs in mice and humans [32]. collectively,
these studies demonstrated that the  xxxg560xxx –cxcr4 axis is
involved in marrow retention of hscs and demonstrated the
clinical potential of  xxxd2974xxx  in hsc mobilization (figure 2).
additional preclinical studies with  xxxd2974xxx  in both
canine and macaque monkey transplantation models confirmed
the ability of  xxxd2974xxx  to mobilize hscs which result in
rapid and durable engraftment when transplanted into
irradiated recipients [33,34]. these studies also suggest that
functionally, hscs mobilized with  xxxd2974xxx  differ from
those mobilized with g-csf. a higher proportion of
 xxxd2974xxx -mobilized cd34+ cells are in the g1 phase of
the cell cycle and express higher levels of cxcr4 and
 xxxg1203xxx  on the cell surface compared with g-csf-mobilized
cells [34]. in addition, in xenotransplantation models in
nod/scid immunodeficient mice  xxxd2974xxx -mobilized
peripheral blood contained a higher frequency of scid
repopulating cells when measured by limited dilution [35].
the significance of these differences in stem cell characteristics
remains unknown.
2.2

phase i – ii studies

devine et al. conducted a limited phase i study of  xxxd2974xxx 
for stem cell mobilization in which 13 patients with either
multiple myeloma or nhl received a single sq dose of
 xxxd2974xxx  at 160 or 240 µg/kg and were analyzed at 4 and
6 h after injection. after injection,  xxxd2974xxx  caused a rapid,
dose-dependent increase in the total white blood cell and
peripheral blood cd34+ counts [36]. although a sevenfold
increase in circulating cd34+ cells was observed at the
240 µg/kg dose, the increases is less than that observed in
normal volunteers and less than that with g-csf alone at
an equivalent dose and presumably is due to the damage
induced by chemotherapy for the underlying disease.
a subsequent phase ii study examined the combination
of  xxxd2974xxx  and g-csf in a crossover design. twenty-five
patients were assigned to receive either subcutaneous  xxxd2974xxx 
(160 or 240 µg/kg) plus g-csf or g-csf alone as their
initial mobilization regimen followed by a 2-week wash out
period followed by remobilization with the alternate regimen.
in this study, the number of circulating cd34+ cells
increased by 2.9-fold at 6 h after the first dose of  xxxd2974xxx .
this increase translated into increased stem cell yields, as in
every individual the number of cd34+ cells harvested after
 xxxd2974xxx  plus g-csf was greater than that for g-csf alone
irrespective of the initial mobilization regimen. furthermore,
in all nine patients who did not collect a minimum of
2 × 106 cd34+/kg cells with g-csf alone, the combination of
 xxxd2974xxx  plus g-csf resulted in successful mobilization [37].
 xxxd2974xxx  has also been made available via single-patient
and compassionate use protocols. subjects considered to
be mobilization failures due to low peripheral cd34+ cell
count or low cd34+ cell yields from their first pheresis
session were judged unlikely to meet a minimum of
2 × 106 cd34+ cells/kg for transplantation were treated with

binding to cxcr4 resulting in peak mobilization  xxxd1891xxx  – 16 h. g-csf mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells (hscs) occurs via an
indirect mechanism through downregulation of sdf-1 production by marrow osteoblasts, altered expression of integrins and the release
of proteases which cleave critical adhesion molecules in the marrow. in contrast to  xxxd2974xxx , g-csf induced mobilization peaks at
4 – 5 days after administration.

the combination of  xxxd2974xxx  plus g-csf. in a report on
the initial 115 patients, the rates of successful mobilization
defined as the ability to collect 2 × 106 cd34+/kg using
 xxxd2974xxx  plus g-csf was 60.3% in patients with nhl,
71.4% in those with multiple myeloma and 76.5% in those
with hodgkin’s lymphoma [38].
in the allogeneic donor setting,  xxxd2974xxx  has also been
administered alone without g-csf [39]. in this study,
25 patients were mobilized with a dose of  xxxd2974xxx 
(240 µg/kg subcutaneous) followed by large-volume apheresis
4 h later on the same day. in two-thirds of donors, sufficient
numbers of hscs were collected in a single apheresis session.
although the cd34+ yields obtained were lower than those
observed with a standard g-csf mobilization, engraftment
was robust. compared with a g-csf mobilized graft, the
 xxxd2974xxx  graft contained approximately twofold higher
numbers of cd3+ and cd4+ t cells which may result in
different effects on immune reconstitution and graft-versus-host
and graft-versus-disease post-transplant.
2.3

phase iii studies

based on the results of phase i and ii studies, two multicenter
double-blinded placebo-controlled studies have recently been
completed with  xxxd2974xxx  in patients with nhl and multiple
myeloma undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (figure 3).
in optimize i, 298 patients with nhl were randomized
to receive g-csf 10µg/kg/day plus  xxxd2974xxx  240 µg/kg/day
versus g-csf + placebo. the primary end point, collection
of 5 × 106 cd34+ cells /kg in four or fewer days of apheresis
1800

was achieved in 59% of patients on the  xxxd2974xxx  arm
compared with 20% in the placebo arm (p < 0.0001) [40].
the time to eutrophil and platelet recovery was similar in
both arms. patients failing to reach 0.8 × 106 cd34+ cells/kg
after a single apheresis or 2 × 106 cd34+ cells/kg after
4 days were eligible to continue on a rescue protocol in
which patients received  xxxd2974xxx  and g-csf while remaining
blinded to their initial assignment. of these failure patients,
52 in the original placebo group and 10 in the original
 xxxd2974xxx  group consented to enter into the rescue arm
of the study. after rescue therapy, 33/52 (63%) patients
from the original placebo arm and 4/10 (40%) patients
from the orifinal  xxxd2974xxx  arm had successful mobilization
(≥ 2 × 106 cd34+ cells/kg collected). in this study, 35% of
patients assigned to the g-csf plus placebo arm failed to
mobilize versus only 7% in the g-csf plus  xxxd2974xxx 
arm [41].
in optimize ii, 302 patients with multiple myeloma
were randomized to receive g-csf plus placebo versus
g-csf plus  xxxd2974xxx . a higher stem cell target was used
as the primary end point in this study as tandem autologous
transplantation is considered an important treatment modality
for patients with myeloma [42]. again, both neutrophil
and platelet engraftment was robust in both arms with no
differences in graft durability.
in both phase iii studies,  xxxd2974xxx  was extremely well
tolerated with negligible serious side effects. the only
attributable adverse events were mild gastrointestinal effects
such as nausea and diarrhea and increased incidence of
injection site erythema for the  xxxd2974xxx  arm. based on the

conclusions

 xxxd2974xxx  is an effective and well tolerated agent for the
mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells for use in autologous
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. the combination of
 xxxd2974xxx  and g-csf results in higher stem cell collection
numbers in fewer apheresis sessions compared with g-csf
alone. furthermore, the combination is an effective salvage
mobilization regimen for a significant proportion of patients
who fail g-csf mobilization alone.
4.

expert opinion

while approval of  xxxd2974xxx  as a stem cell mobilization agent
appears likely given the results of the pivotal phase iii studies,
the role of  xxxd2974xxx  in clinical practice remains to be defined.
 xxxd2974xxx  may be used up-front in combination with g-csf
or it may be used as a salvage therapy for those who fail
other mobilization strategies. these decisions will reflect the

economics of stem cell mobilization, which must balance
the cost of  xxxd2974xxx  versus the cost and resources required
for additional mobilization procedures. algorithms to stratify
patients based on their probability of failing g-csf-only
mobilization will be required to guide clinicians on the optimal
use of  xxxd2974xxx . for example, patients with nhl who have
received extensive prior chemotherapy are predicted to mobilize
poorly with g-csf alone and may be good candidates for
initial mobilization with g-csf plus  xxxd2974xxx  [43].
alternatively, markers such as peripheral blood cd34+ cell
counts prior to pheresis can be used to predict successful
g-csf mobilization [44,45]. patients with a low peripheral
blood cd34+ cell counts (< 10/mm3) prior to pheresis
could then receive  xxxd2974xxx  to improve stem cell yields.
ongoing research with  xxxd2974xxx  is directed at optimizing
the kinetics of mobilization and expanding potential disease
indications. in recently completed phase iii studies,  xxxd2974xxx 
was administered via subcutaneous administration  xxxd1891xxx  pm
the night prior to apheresis as the peak hsc mobilization
occurs 10 – 16 h post administration. because of
logistical difficulties in night-time administration, intravenous
administration of  xxxd2974xxx  to improve the kinetics of
mobilization may allow same day administration and collection
of hscs.

 xxxd2974xxx 

the promise of  xxxd2974xxx  extends far beyond its use as a
mobilization agent for hsct. extensive studies have examined
the role that bone-marrow-derived stem and progenitor cells
may play in promoting tissue repair following acute vascular
injury [46-48]. in preclinical models,  xxxd2974xxx  has been noted
to mobilize a class of cells known as endothelial progenitor
cells into the peripheral circulation. these cells are able to
home to sites of vascular injury and stimulate angiogenesis
thereby enhancing revascularization [49-51] although additional
preclinical data are required to elucidate the mechanisms of
stem-cell-mediated repair, these studies provide a rationale
for the investigation of  xxxd2974xxx  in conditions such as
acute coronary syndromes, cerebrovascular and peripheral
vascular disease.
in addition to hscs, cxcr4 is expressed on the cell surface
of a number of hematopoietic and solid tumor malignancies
including acute myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, breast
and lung cancer [52]. the cxcr4/sdf-1 axis functions
as a critical tether between these cells and their tumor
microenvironment. these interactions are thought to play an

chemotherapy or targeted agents are currently underway in
hematological malignancies.
 xxxd2974xxx  is the first agent to specifically target the
cxcr4–sdf-1 axis. while studies of hematopoietic stem
cell mobilization have demonstrated its clinical utility, the
importance of this target in other conditions such as in
cardiovascular diseases and cancer therapeutics will hinge on
the outcome of ongoing preclinical and clinical studies. in
addition, other cxcr4 inhibitors are currently in development,
such as msx-122 for cancer therapeutics (metastatix inc),
and may someday challenge  xxxd2974xxx  in these areas.
