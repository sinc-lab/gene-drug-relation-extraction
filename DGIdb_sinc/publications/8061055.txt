abstract

the  xxxg807xxx  (fr), an essential component in the process of folate uptake in various cells, is known to exist in three
isoforms, fr-a, fr-/3 and fr-y, with differential tissue expression. transfer of folate across the human placenta from mother to
fetus involves participation of a  xxxg807xxx  expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast, but the isoform identity of this receptor has
not been established. based on the tissue/cell type from which these isoforms have been cloned, it is currently believed that
fr-a is the isoform expressed in adult tissues whereas fr-/3 is the isoform expressed in fetal tissues including placenta. the
present study, undertaken primarily to establish the isoform identity of the fr expressed in the placental syncytiotrophoblast,
does not support this currently prevailing nomenclature. reverse transcription coupled with polymerase chain reaction
(rt-pcr) of total/poly(a) + rna from placenta, cultured trophoblast cells and jar choriocarcinoma cells with primer pairs
specific for either fr-a or fr-fl reveals that while both isoforms are detectable in the whole placental tissue, only fr-a is
present in the normal trophoblast cells and in the choriocarcinoma cells. northern analysis with probes designed to distinguish
between the mrna transcripts coding for these two isoforms corroborate the rt-pcr findings. furthermore, the nucleotide
sequences of the pcr products obtained from the trophoblast cells and jar cells are identical to the nucleotide sequence of the
fr-a cdna. these studies establish that it is the fr-a isoform, and not the fr-fl isoform, which is selectively expressed in the
placental trophoblast cells. fr-/3, which is known to be present in the placenta, most likely arises from the maternal decidua
normally associated with this tissue.

t h e r e are three known isoforms of the human folate
receptor (fr) which are differentially expressed in
different tissues. these are fr-a, fr-/3, and fr-y. all
three isoforms have been cloned [1-6]. the predicted
amino acid sequences of these three frs exhibit approximately 70% homology among them. available evidence on tissue distribution of these isoforms indicates
that fr-a and fr-y are expressed in a number of
tissues. in contrast, placenta is the only tissue in which
the expression of fr-fl has been demonstrated. in
addition to fr-fl, placenta also possesses fr-a. the

cdnas for fr-a and fr-fl have been isolated from a
placental c d n a library [1,2]. because of this pattern of
tissue distribution, fr-/3 has been designated as the
fetal/placental isoform [1,6,7,8] and the gene encoding
this protein as the fetal/placental f r gene [9,10]. the
presence of the fr-a, the putative adult isoform [1,6,9],
in the placenta is believed to be due to the fact that the
placental samples obtained at delivery always contain
significant amounts of maternal decidual tissue.
frs play a role in the cellular uptake of folate
either by receptor-mediated endocytosis [11] or by potocytosis [12]. it is very likely that the frs expressed in
the placenta participate in the transplacental transfer
of folate from mother to fetus. the functional unit of
the placenta is the syncytiotrophoblast which possesses

72

transport systems for various nutrients [13]. this cell,
however, constitutes only a minor fraction of the total
cell population present in the normal term placenta.
even though the presence of two fr isoforms, fr-a
and fr-/3, has been demonstrated in the placenta, the
identity of the fr isoform expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast has not been established. the currently prevailing wide acceptance of the notion that fr-/3 is the
fetal/placental isoform [1,6,7-10] implies that this is
the isoform which is expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast, but there is no experimental evidence supporting this suggestion. we have recently demonstrated
that the jar placental choriocarcinoma cells express a
fr which catalyzes the cellular uptake of folate by the
potocytotic process [14]. this cell line has the potential
to provide a model to investigate the cellular processes
involved in the transfer of folate across the placenta.
however, the isoform identity of the fr present in this
cell line remains unknown. since the maternal-to-fetal
transfer of folate is exclusively catalyzed by the fr
expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast, it is important to
establish the identity of this fr. the purpose of the
present investigation was to determine the isoform
identity of the f r expressed in normal placental syncytiotrophoblast and in jar placental choriocarcinoma
cells.
trophoblast cells from normal term human placentas were isolated and cultured according to the procedure described by kliman et al. [15] with a few modifications [16]. human placentas from uncomplicated
full-term pregnancies were obtained immediately after
vaginal delivery or cesarian section. after isolation,
trophoblast cells ( 1 0 . 1 0 6 cells/ml) were frozen in liquid nitrogen in m e m b (eagle's minimum essential
medium supplemented with a 1.5-fold excess of essential amino acids, 2.0-fold excess of nonessential amino
acids, and 1.5-fold excess of vitamins) containing 10%
fetal bovine serum and 10% dimethylsulfoxide [16].
frozen cells were thawed and cultured in 75 cm 2 flasks
in m e m b containing 10% fetal bovine serum. culture
medium was changed daily and cells were used for
r n a isolation after 72 h culturing. under these cul-

ture conditions, the mononucleated undifferentiated
trophoblast cells differentiate to form multinucleated
syncytial trophoblast cells [17,18].
the jar human placental choriocarcinoma cells
(american type culture collection) were cultured in
rpmi-1640 medium in the presence of 10% fetal
bovine serum as described earlier [19,20].
total r n a was isolated from cultured trophoblast
cells by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method [21],
followed by csc1 centrifugation. poly(a) + r n a from
jar cells was prepared using the rna extraction kit
and the m r n a purification kit from pharmacia. total
r n a from normal term human placenta, obtained
immediately after cesarian section and from the outer
cortex of the human kidney, obtained at an autopsy
done within 12 h of death, was prepared by using
rnazol (biotecx) according to the manufacturer's protocol. poly(a) + rna was then isolated by affinity
chromatography on oligo dt-cellulose. all rna samples were checked for degradation by visualization of
ribosomal r n a bands with ethidium bromide following agarose gel electrophoresis.
the primers (table 1) used in rna-pcr were
designed to contain an xhoi site in the sense primers
and an xbai site in the antisense primers for directional cloning of the pcr products. total r n a /
poly(a) + r n a was reverse-transcribed using the
geneamp rna-pcr kit (perkin-elmer) for 1 h at
42°c in 20 /zl of the mixture containing 1 /zg rna,
0.75 /zm antisense primer, 20 units of rnaase inhibitor and 50 units of murine leukemia virus reverse
transcriptase according to the protocol provided by
perkin-elmer. pcr (95°c, 0.45 min; 55°c, 0.45 min,
72°c, 1.3 min, 39 cycles) was then performed in 100 ~1
of the mixture containing 0.15 /zm each of sense and
antisense primers, 2.5 units of amplitaq dna polymerase and 2.5 mm mgc12.
pcr products were genecleaned and, following digestion with xhoi and xbai, were ligated into pbluescript sk i i ( - ) . transfection was done with d h 5 a
cells by heat shock. the cdna inserts were sequenced
by the dideoxy chain termination method using the

total r n a / p o l y ( a ) ÷ r n a was size-fractionated
on a denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred onto an activated nylon membrane (hybond n ÷,
amersham). the blots were hybridized to 32p-labeled
e d n a probes under high stringency conditions as described earlier [22]. the probes were labeled with
[a-32p]dctp by random priming using the oligolabeling kit from pharmacia. post-hybridization washes included two washes with 2 x sspe (1 x sspe = 0.15 m
naci, 32 mm n a h 2 p o 4, 1 mm disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate, ph 7.4) containing 0.1% sodium
 xxxd3215xxx  (sds) for 20 min each at room temperature followed by one wash with 0.5 x sspe containing
0.1% sds for 20 min at 65°c.
four different e d n a probes were used in northern
analysis. two of them contained the complete coding
region of either fr-a or fr-fl and were prepared as
follows. placental poly(a) ÷ r n a was subjected to
r n a - p c r with the primer pairs consisting of either
f r - a l and f r - a 2 or fr-/31 and fr-/32 (table 1). the
pcr products were cloned into pbluescript sk i i ( - ).
the c d n a inserts ( ~ 0.8 kb) were released from the
plasmids by x h o i / x b a i digestion. the other two
probes contained predominantly the 3' non-coding region of either fr-a c d n a or fr-/3 cdna. these
were obtained as follows. placental poly{a) + r n a was
subjected to r n a - p c r with the primer pairs consisting of either f r - a l and fr-a3 or fr-/31 and fr-/3-3
(table 1). the pcr products were cloned into pbluescript sk i i ( - ) . the plasmids were digested with psti
and x b a i to release the c d n a probes comprising a
184 base pair sequence corresponding to the nucleotide position 694-877 of the fr-a cdna [2] or a
246 base pair sequence corresponding to the nucleotide position 938-1183 of the fr-/3 c d n a [1].
the expression of fr-a and fr-/3 in the placenta,
trophoblast and j a r choriocarcinoma cell line was
first investigated by r n a - p c r using the primers f r - a l
and f r - a 2 which are specific for fr-a, and the primers
fr-/31 and fr-/32 which are specific for fr-/3. total
r n a was used for the trophoblast cells whereas
poly(a) + r n a was used for the placenta and the jar
cells. the expected size of the pcr products with both
pairs of primers is about 0.8 kb. fig. 1 shows that the
placental r n a yielded pcr products of expected size
with the fr-a-specific primers as well as with the
fr-/3-specific primers. in contrast, the trophoblast cells
and the jar cells were positive only for fr-a. r n a
from these cells failed to generate the pcr product of
expected size with fr-/3-specific primers.
h u m a n kidney is known to express a f r [23], though
the isoform identity of the receptor has not been
determined. in the present study, we have used
poly(a) + r n a isolated from an adult human kidney to

investigate the expression pattern of the fr isoforms
in adult tissues. rna-pcr with the kidney r n a revealed that this tissue expresses fr-a as well as fr-/3
(fig. 1).
fr-a and fr-/3 exhibit significant homology in
amino acid sequence. therefore, isoform-specific
m r n a transcripts may not be differentiated in northern analysis when full-length cdnas of fr-a and
fr-/3 consisting of the coding regions are used as
probes. a n u m b e r of studies [4,7,8,14,22,24] have utilized the full-length edna probes for detection of fr
m r n a transcripts in normal tissues and cultured cell
lines, but it is not possible to deduce the isoform
identity of fr in these studies. the nucleotide sequences of the 3' non-coding region of the cdnas of
fr-a and fr-/3 differ considerably however, and
probes can be obtained from these regions which are
specific for either fr-a or fr-/3. such probes have
been used recently to specifically identify the fr-a
gene and the fr-/3 gene in southern analysis [9].
these specific probes can be employed in northern
analysis to investigate the differential expression of fr
isoforms in tissues and cultured cells. to our knowledge, there has been no published report to date on
the use of this approach to establish the identity of the
f r m r n a transcripts. to confirm the results obtained
with the rna-pcr regarding the expression of the fr
isoforms in the placenta, trophoblast cells, jar cells,
and kidney, r n a samples from these tissues/cells
were probed in northern analysis with full-length
cdnas as well as with the isoform-specific 3' non-coding region fragments (fig. 2).
panels a and c in fig. 2 describe the results with
the full-length edna probes encoding fr-/3 and fr-a,
respectively. the presence of an r n a species, 1.3 kb
in size, which hybridizes to both of these probes under

high stringency conditions, was evident not only in the
placenta and the kidney but also in trophoblast cells
and jar cells (the intensity of the signals in trophoblast cells was relatively weak because of the use of
total rna). since the rna-pcr analysis has already
revealed that the placenta and the kidney express both
fr-a and fr-/3 whereas the trophoblast cells and the
jar cells express only fr-a, these results indicate that
the full-length cdna probes do not distinguish between the two fr isoforms. panels b and d show the
results with the fr-/3-specific probe and the fr-aspecific probe, respectively. both probes demonstrate
the presence of hybridizing rna species in the placenta and the kidney, consistent with the expression of
fr-a as well as fr-/3 in these two tissues. in contrast,
the trophoblast cells and the jar cells showed positive
signals only with the fr-a-specific probe. there were
no mrna transcripts in these cells which hybridized to
the fr-/3-specific probe.

fig. 2. northern analysis. total rna/poly(a) + rna from placenta
(1), trophoblast cells (2), jar cells (3) and kidney (4) was size-fractionated on a denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel and hybridized to
the following: a, a ~ 0.8 kb probe consisting of the coding region of
fr-/3; b, a 246 base pair probe derived from the 3' region of the
fr-/3 cdna; c, a ~ 0.8 kb probe consisting of the coding region of
fr-a; d, a 184 base pair probe derived from the 3' region of the
fr-a cdna. the arrows indicate the position of the fr mrna
transcripts ( ~ 1.3 kb). additional hybridizing bands seen with kidney
rna were due to partial degradation of the rna sample.

taken collectively, the results from rna-pcr and
northern analysis clearly show that the trophoblast
cells and the jar cells selectively express the fr-oz
isoform. there is no evidence for the presence of the
fr-/3 isoform in these cells. it is clear, however, that
the placenta and the kidney express both isoforms.
to establish unequivocally the identity of the fr
isoform expressed in the trophoblast cells and the jar
cells, the rna-pcr products obtained from these
cells were cloned into pbluescript vector and sequenced (fig. 3). the nucleotide sequences of these
clones were found to be identical to that of the fr-a
cdna [2].
the findings from this study that the normal placental trophoblast and the jar choriocarcinoma cells
express only fr-a are of importance for several reasons. these data establish for the first time the identity
of the fr that is responsible for the transfer of folate
across the placenta from mother to fetus. furthermore,
the currently used nomenclature of fr-a as the adult
type and of fr-/3 as the fetal/placental type needs to
be revised in the light of these findings. since the
trophoblast cells express exclusively the fr-a isoform,
with no evidence for the presence of the fr-/3 isoform,
it is fr-a, and not fr-/3, that has to be classified as
the fetal/placental type. it has to be noted here that
the currently prevailing classification of fr-/3 as the
fetal/placental type and of fr-a as the adult type
apparently originated from the fact that fr-a has been
cloned from a number of different tissues whereas
fr-/3 has so far been cloned only from the placenta.
interestingly, however, while it is true that the fr-a
cdna has been prepared from several neoplastic cells

p.d. prasad et al. / biochimica et biophysica acta 1223 (1994) 71-75

arising from different tissues (e.g., nasopharyngeal carcinoma, colon carcinoma and ovarian carcinoma), this
isoform has never been cloned from a normal adult
tissue. it is likely that the neoplastic cells preferentially
express the fetal isoform (fr-a) and this might explain
why these cells yielded the fr-a cdna rather than
the fr-/3 cdna. the placenta is the only normal
tissue thus far used for the cloning of the frs. therefore, it is not surprising that the placenta remains as
the only tissue from which the fr-/3 cdna has been
prepared. the fr-/3 in the normal placenta arises
most probably from the maternal decidual tissue, even
though the possibility of non-trophoblast cells of the
placenta as an additional source of fr-/3 cannot be
entirely discounted at this time.
based on what is known on the functional characteristics of fr-a and fr-fl, it is readily apparent that the
selective expression of fr-a in the placental trophoblast is advantageous for efficient transfer of folate
across the placenta. recent studies [25] have demonstrated that fr-a preferentially binds to the physiologically occurring diastereoisomers (6s) of reduced
folate whereas fr-/3 preferentially binds to the nonphysiological diastereoisomers (6r). in addition, the
affinities of fr-a to various folate analogs are manyfold greater than the corresponding affinities of fr-fl.
in particular, fr-a exhibits a 50-fold higher affinity
than fr-/3 toward 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (6s), the
predominant form of folate in blood.
it is interesting to note that the adult kidney expresses fr-a as well as fr-/3. the co-occurrence of
fr-tz and fr-/3 may not be unique to the kidney. it is
possible that a similar phenomenon occurs in other
adult tissues as well. however, while it is evident from
the present studies that the placental trophoblast possesses only fr-a, whether the selective expression of
this isoform is the characteristic of all other fetal
tissues remains to be determined.
the present study also provides information on the
identity of the fr isoform expressed in the jar cells.
these cells have been widely used in our laboratory as
a model to investigate placental transport of various
nutrients [26-30]. recently, we have investigated the
cellular mechanism of folate transport in these cells
[14]. the results of the current study showing that the
expression pattern of the fr isoforms in the normal
placental trophoblast and in the jar ceils are identical
lend credence to the use of the jar cells as a model to
investigate placental folate transport.
