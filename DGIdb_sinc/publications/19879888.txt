benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) is the noncancerous proliferation of the prostate gland associated
with benign prostatic obstruction and lower urinary tract symptoms (luts) such as frequency, hesitancy,
urgency, etc. its prevalence increases with age affecting around 70% by the age of 70 years. high activity of
5␣-reductase enzyme in humans results in excessive dihydrotestosterone levels in peripheral tissues and
hence suppression of androgen action by 5␣-reductase inhibitors is a logical treatment for bph as they
inhibit the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. finasteride (13) was the ﬁrst steroidal 5␣reductase inhibitor approved by u.s. food and drug administration (usfda). in human it decreases the
prostatic dht level by 70–90% and reduces the prostatic size. dutasteride (27) another related analogue
has been approved in 2002. unlike finasteride, dutasteride is a competitive inhibitor of both 5␣-reductase
type i and type ii isozymes, reduced dht levels >90% following 1 year of oral administration. a number
of classes of non-steroidal inhibitors of 5␣-reductase have also been synthesized generally by removing
one or more rings from the azasteroidal structure or by an early non-steroidal lead (ono-3805) (261). in
this review all categories of inhibitors of 5␣-reductase have been covered.

1. introduction
benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) is the noncancerous growth
of the prostate gland resulting due to over-proliferation of the
stromal and glandular elements of the prostate [1]. it is caused
due to the augmented levels of the androgen dihydrotestosterone
(dht). in bph, microscopic foci within speciﬁc regions of the
prostate grows to form macroscopic nodules which eventually displace the normal prostatic tissue and results into the uretheral
compression. this compression resulting due to increased cell proliferation and/or impaired apoptosis causes physical enlargement
of the prostate gland and is referred to as static component. in
addition dynamic component involves sympathetic nerve stimulation causing contraction of prostatic and uretheral smooth
muscle which results into outﬂow obstruction [2]. despite several
hypotheses the molecular trigger for bph remains unknown [3].
the incidence of bph is about 70% at 70 years of age and becomes
nearly universal with advancing age. clinically, bph causes a constellation of symptoms known as lower urinary tract symptoms
(luts). the hallmarks of the luts include frequency, hesitancy,
urgency, nocturia, slow urinary stream and incomplete emptying
[4]. earlier the choice of treatment in bph was watchful waiting,
transurethral resection of the prostate (turp) or open prostatectomy but due to the invasive nature and potential side effects
many medical therapies have emerged involving the suppression of
androgen stimulation of prostatic growth [5]. these therapies delay
or eliminate the requirement of surgery. 5␣-reductase enzyme
has emerged as a target for the pharmaceutical treatment of bph
as abnormally high activity of the enzyme in humans results in
excessive dht levels in peripheral tissues and hence suppression
of androgen action by 5␣-reductase inhibitors is a logical treatment
for bph [6]. a large number of molecules have been synthesized as
potential 5␣-reductase inhibitors over the years. several analogues
may also act as  xxxg183xxx  antagonists by preventing the
natural ligands of the  xxxg183xxx  such as testosterone (t) (1)
and dht (2) from binding to the receptor. combination of these two
categories of inhibitors may provide effective  xxxg183xxx 
blockage without undesirable side effects of castrate testosterone
levels on muscle and bone mass, energy level and libido which are of
particular concern [7]. some earlier reports have been there covering various aspects of 5␣-reductase enzyme and inhibitors [8–10]
but a comprehensive review of each category and structural features required for 5␣-reductase inhibitory activity were missing.
this review is an attempt to cover all categories of inhibitors of 5␣reductase with an aim to list the most potent compounds of each
category along with the special structural requirements that led
to 5␣-reductase inhibitory activity and in vitro data obtained from
the evaluation of steroidal and non-steroidal compounds that have
been tested as inhibitors of 5␣-reductase. in particular ic50 and ki

values for relevant compounds have been compared according to
the molecular class. the values given are not comparable across
the studies and in each comparison a standard taken in the study

2. enzyme 5␣-reductase
a signiﬁcant correlation between the androgens and prostate is
well known. testicular androgens constitute the most important
mitogenic factor in vivo for the prostate [11]. normal circulating
levels of androgens are required for the maintenance of structural
function, growth and integrity of the prostate tissue. however,
androgens have no direct effect on prostatic epithelial cells in
culture [12]. androgens enhance the production of many growth
factors in the prostate tissue in vivo through a complex cell to
cell interaction involving both epithelial and stromal prostatic cells
[13]. androgen signalling cascade involves the synthesis of t (1) in
testes and adrenal glands which gets peripherally converted to dht
(2). dht formed gets transferred to the target tissues and binds to
the target receptor with consequent modulation of gene expression
[14]. both t and dht bind to and activate the  xxxg183xxx 
(ar), but dht shows a higher afﬁnity leading to different kinetic
processes. dht dissociates from ar protein much more slowly than
its precursor. therefore, at a given time ars are occupied by dht
much more than by testosterone. t is converted to dht by a steroid
5␣-reductase enzyme (3-oxo-steroid-4-ene dehydrogenase {e.c.
1.3.99.5}) which is a system of two membrane bound nicotinamide
dinucleotide phosphate (nadph) dependent enzymes at the level
of prostatic stromal and basal cells. this has led to the development of steroidal and non-steroidal 5␣-reductase inhibitors as they
inhibit the conversion of t (1) to dht (2) as shown in fig. 1 [15–17].
thus 5␣-reductase dictates the cellular availability of dht to prostatic epithelial cells and consequently modulates its growth.
the proposed chemical mechanism of t (1) reduction to dht (2)
by 5␣-reductase catalysis involves the formation of a binary complex between the enzyme and nadph, followed by the formation of
a ternary complex with the substrate t. a delocalized carbocation is

formed due to the activation of the enone system by a strong interaction with an electrophilic residue (e+ ) present in the active site.
enolate of dht is formed by the direct hydride transfer from nadph
to the ␣ face of the delocalized carbocation leading to a selective
reduction at c-5. this enolate which is coordinated with nadp+ on
the ␣ face, is attacked by a proton on the ␤-face at c-4 giving the
ternary complex e-nadp+ -dht. binary nadp+ –enzyme complex
is formed after departure of dht and ﬁnally the release of nadp+
leaves the free enzyme for further catalytic cycles. three different types of inhibitors could be conceived according to the kinetic
mechanism of testosterone reduction: type a inhibitors which are
competitive with the cofactor (nadph) and the substrate (t) and
interact with the free enzyme; type b inhibitors which are competitive with the substrate and ﬁt the enzyme–nadph complex, and
type c inhibitors which ﬁts the enzyme–nadp+ complex exhibiting
uncompetitive mechanism versus the substrate [8,18].
more potent inhibitors of steroid 5␣-reductase have been found
among the transition state analogues as molecules mimicking the
transition state of the enzymatic processes exhibit a greater binding
to the enzyme and hence produce greater inhibition. the enzyme
5␣-reductase binds the 3-keto-4 steroids in such a way that the
carbonyl group is brought into vicinity of a positively charged
centre on the enzyme whereby the conjugated ketone becomes
activated as shown in fig. 2.
a hydride ion can then be transferred from the coenzyme
nadph to the 5␣-position of the steroid. the resulting enolate is
protonated at the axial 4␤-position by the solvent and the product
is released. this evidence for protonation was based on the model
studies with the penicillium decumbens 5␣-reductase enzyme [19].
modern methods of molecular biology had assisted in identifying two types of 5␣-reductase enzyme: type i and type ii from
human and rat prostatic complimentary deoxyribonucleic acid
(cdna) libraries and the structures of both genes were elucidated
at the beginning of this decade [20,21]. the type i enzyme is not the
major species expressed in the prostate and is present mainly in the
hair follicles and peripheral skin whereas type ii 5␣-reductase is the
major isozyme in genital tissues and a deletion in the gene leads
to male pseudohermaphroditism [22,23]. type i enzyme is constitutively expressed in the brain and in adulthood appears mainly
localized in the myelin membranes and has a catabolic rather than
an activating role in the brain while type ii enzyme is transiently
expressed in the prenatal period and in males its expression is
controlled by androgens and appears to be conﬁned in the hypothalamus and in the hippocampus after stress hence type ii enzyme
might participate in the perinatal differentiation of brain towards
a male pattern [24].
the two isozymes differ in the constitution of amino acids as
well as molecular weight. the type i isozymes is active at ph 6–9
while type ii is active at ph 5.5. the two isozymes also differ in
the location of the gene structure while type i is located at 5p15
while type ii is located at 2p22 although they had same gene structure [8,25]. the comparison of the properties of two isozymes is
summarized in the table 1:

more recently with the development of genome-wide gene
expression proﬁle analyses a third type of 5␣-reductase enzyme
(type iii) has been identiﬁed in hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells (hrpc) [26]. this enzyme also converts t to dht in hrpc
cells in a similar way to type i enzyme and was found to be active
at ph 6.9 [27]. type iii isozyme has been recognized as a ubiquitous
enzyme in mammals. northern blot and real time rt-pcr analyses
have identiﬁed this enzyme in both androgen and non-androgen
target human tissues such as pancreas, brain, prostate cancer cell
lines, skin and adipose tissues [28].
based on their structure 5␣-reductase inhibitors are discussed
below as  xxxd3411xxx .

3. steroidal 5␣-reductase inhibitors
as the only information available about the 5␣-reductase
isozymes is their primary sequence estimated from c-dnas the
design of novel inhibitors is affected. due to the unstable nature
of enzyme during puriﬁcation its crystal structure is not known.
the ﬁrst inhibitors have been therefore designed by modifying the
structure of natural substrates, including the substitution of one
carbon atom of the rings of the steroids by a heteroatom such as
nitrogen thereby forming azasteroids. singh and coworkers [29,30]
as well as other groups have published comprehensive reviews on
biological activity of azasteroids [31]. azasteroidal compounds having nitrogens at various positions have also been covered in this
review. however, their 5␣-reductase inhibitory activity has either
not been done or they are devoid of activity. some azasteroids have
been found to be 5␣-reductase inhibitors. in the following section
azasteroidal inhibitors have been discussed depending upon the
position of nitrogen in the steroidal nucleus, i.e. nuclear azasteroids.

4. 2- and 3-azasteroids
although some of the 3-azasteroids were synthesized by
doorenbos and wu [32] and mazur [33] in the early 1960s but
anderson and liao in 1968 reported for the ﬁrst time that steroidal
n-oxido-3-aza-1,3,5(10)-triene is a good inhibitor of enzyme 5␣reductase [34]. haffner in 1994, reported the synthesis of some
novel 3-pyridyl-n-oxide steroids (3 and 4) [35] which mimic the
enolate or enol like transition state of the enzyme–substrate complex.

n-oxide steroids (3) and (4) were assayed against both type i and
type ii 5␣-reductase and proved to be potent inhibitors of type ii
5␣-reductase with the ki (␮m) being 0.031 and 0.104, respectively.
in 2003, robinson et al. reported the synthesis of various 2- and
3-azasteroidal derivatives (5–10) as effective and stable transition
state 5␣-reductase inhibitors [36].

possessing these features act as competitive inhibitors of testosterone 5␣-reductase, therefore, all of them could be regarded as a
substrate of the enzyme 4-en-3-one steroids [38]. 4- xxxd2618xxx -3one-17-carboxylic acid (11) was identiﬁed as a potent inhibitor of
5␣-reductase.

all the synthesised 2- and 3-azasteroids (5–10) were evaluated
for human 5␣-reductase inhibition. amines (6 and 10) showed poor
inhibitory activity against both type i and type ii isozymes whereas
lactams (5 and 9) displayed only marginal improvement against
type ii isozymes. however, nitrones (7 and 8) showed signiﬁcant
enhancement in biological activity.
5. 4-azasteroids
4-azasteroids is one of the extensively studied and clinically
used classes of azasteroidal 5␣-reductase inhibitors. voigt et al. in
1970, screened a large number of steroids including 23 steroidal
hormones for their ability to inhibit the conversion of t (1) into dht
(2) by a crude cell free enzyme system isolated from rat ventral
prostate [37]. in 1973, series of effective 5␣-reductase inhibitors
were synthesized and evaluated. from the studies it was established that the key structural requirements for the 5␣-reductase
inhibitory activity were presence of 4-en-3-one function and 17␤side chain having one or more oxygen functionalities. molecules

it has been reported to be a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme
and showed 87.7% inhibition for the microsomal enzyme of human
skin. none of the compounds from this series could be shown
to interfere with in vivo conversion of the dihydrotestosterone,
because of their rapid conversion into the inactive 4,5-dihydro form
by the enzyme.

fig. 3. basic sar of 4-azasteroids.

in search for a nonreducible inhibitor of 5␣-reductase, merck
and co. in 1980 reported series of 4-azasteroids where c-4 of 3oxo-5␣-steroids was replaced by nitrogen. the studies showed
that there was not only an increase in the 5␣-reductase inhibitory
activity but also retention of the in vivo activity [39,40]. therefore,
azasteroids were designed to mimic the putative enzyme-bound
enolate intermediate by incorporating sp2 -hybridized center at c3 and c-4. thus a lactam was introduced in the ring a of the steroids
to mimic the enol transition state of the enzyme–nadph–substrate

(e.nadph.s) complex. substitution at c-17 has been found to
enhance potency by binding to a lipophilic pocket on the enzyme.
these competitive inhibitors strongly interact with the enzyme at
the active site and on other hand unlike the substrate cannot be further reduced to 5␣-metabolites thus have in vivo inhibitory activity
[41]. the steroidal pharmacophore provides an anchor between the
key a-ring lactam and the c-17 substituent while the former acts as
a transition state mimic of intermediate enolate, the latter signiﬁcantly enhances potency via binding at a pocket largely lipophilic in
nature. the key 4-aza-3-oxo-5␣-androstane pharmacophore and
the basic structure activity relationship (sar) is outlined below
(fig. 3) [42,43].
taking into consideration that substitution at c-17␤- could dramatically affect the potency; a large number of modiﬁcations were
carried out to ﬁnd potent inhibitors [44–46].
4-ma
{17␤-n,n-diethylcarbamoyl-4-methyl-4-aza-5␣androstan-3-one} (12) was found to be a potent dual inhibitor
of both human 5␣-reductase isozymes having ic50 value of
1.9 nm against human 5␣-reductase ii and 1.7 nm against human
5␣-reductase i, however, it was withdrawn from the clinical
developments due to hepatic toxicity and lack of selectivity over
3␤-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase enzyme [47–49]. out of the
series its unsaturated analogue 17␤-(n-tert-butylcarbamoyl)-4-

aza-5␣-androst-1-en-3-one,  xxxd2108xxx , finasteride (13) was found
to be the best and extensively studied. finasteride (13) was a
potent inhibitor of 5␣-reductase type ii with only weak in vitro
activity versus 5␣-reductase type i having ic50 value of 9.4 and
410 nm, respectively. at clinical dose, 5 mg/day, it caused 65–80%
lowering of plasma dht levels [50]. finasteride (13) was the
ﬁrst drug to be approved in u.s. for bph. long-term studies have
demonstrated that there is a sustained improvement in bph
disease and reduction in the prostate speciﬁc antigen (psa) level
[51].

it was reported by merck as well as glaxo in 1996 that finasteride (13) and close analogues are mechanism-based inactivators
of 5␣-reductase ii. although it is accepted as an alternate substrate
and is ultimately reduced to dihydroﬁnasteride (15), this proceeds through an enzyme-bound nadp-dihydroﬁnasteride adduct.
initially it was believed that finasteride (13) act as a transition
state mimic whereby conﬁrmation of the a-ring lactam closely
mimics the enol form of transition state of 5␣-reduced testosterone but now it is understood that the most likely cause of
the slow offset inhibition is rate-limiting hydride transfer from
nadph to the 1 -double bond of finasteride (13). in the case of
the 1,2-ene-containing finasteride (13), reduction of c1 enables
the nucleophilic attack of c2 on the nicotinamide c4. this aberrant reduction results in the formation of lactam enolate which
is not positioned for efﬁcient protonation by the enzyme. instead
the enolate is trapped by the electrophilic pyridinium cation of the
nadp, yielding a covalent adduct to the cofactor and to the protein (fig. 4). this dihydroﬁnasteride–nadp adduct is a remarkably
potent bisubstrate analog inhibitor and it binds to the free enzyme
with a second-order rate constant equal to kcat /km for turnover of
t (1) and has a dissociation constant ki ≤ 1 × 10−13 m. finasteride
(13) is also a mechanism-based inhibitor of the human skin (type
i) isozyme, but it is processed with a much smaller second-order
rate constant, ki /ki = 3 × 103 m−1 s−1 , which attenuates its activ-

ity against this isozyme in vivo. indeed, merck has demonstrated
the presence of (14c) in the inhibited form of 5␣-reductase type i
[52–54].
weintraub et al. in 1985 reported 20-(hydroxymethyl)-4methyl-4-aza-2-oxa-5␣-pregnan-3-ones and their corresponding
3-thiones (16–19). these compounds were tested in vitro for
inhibition of testosterone 5␣-reductase and were found to be
weak inhibitors with ki s in the 10−7 range. it was argued that
replacement of c-2 in the steroid nucleus by oxygen in the case
of 4-aza-3-oxo-steroids would convert it to a urethane (17) from
a lactam (16), respectively, thereby enhancing the polarity at c-3
carbonyl, and its afﬁnity for the enzyme active site [55].

bakshi et al. reported a series of 4-aza-3-oxo-5␣-androstenel7␤-n-aryl-carboxamides as dual inhibitors of human type i and
type ii steroid 5␣-reductases [56]. some of these compounds
were found to be potent inhibitors of both isozymes. variation of
the c-17 amide substituent on the 4-aza-3-androstane skeleton
has resulted into a fruitful search of the potent dual azasteroid
inhibitors (20–26).

s. aggarwal et al. / steroids 75 (2010) 109–153

dutasteride
(gg745),
17␤-n-{2,5-bis(triﬂuoromethyl)phenyl)}-3-oxo-4-aza-5␣-androst-1-ene-17-carboxamide
(27)
had emerged as the most potent dual inhibitor from this group
(table 2) [57]. it has been approved by u.s. fda in 2002, for the
symptomatic treatment of bph [58,59]. unlike finasteride (13),
dutasteride (27) is a competitive inhibitor of both 5␣-reductase
type i and 5␣-reductase type ii isozymes, reduced dihydrotestosterone levels >90% following one year oral administration [60]. it
is also a time dependent inhibitor as finasteride (13) and it forms
a stable complex with a slow rate of dissociation constant and
does not bind to the  xxxg183xxx  [61]. by reducing dht
level, it reduces the size of enlarged prostate, so improving the
urinary ﬂow rate. it is about 60 times more potent than finasteride
(13) and has been shown to decrease the risk of acute urinary
retention and bph related surgery [62–64]. this greater degree of
suppression of serum dht has been found to correlate with the
intraprostatic dht suppression. dual inhibition of 5␣-reductase is
more beneﬁcial than selective type ii inhibition as dual inhibition
does not allow the escape of dht which can formed through type
i mediated synthesis thus providing greater efﬁcacy as dht levels
are suppressed to a great extent. long-term studies have shown
that dutasteride (27) a dual inhibitor is well tolerated during daily
use for up to 2 years. it had a tolerability proﬁle comparable to that

115

of placebo with the exception of a modestly elevated incidence
of impotence and decreased libido compared with placebo. also
dutasteride did not clinically signiﬁcantly impact bone metabolism
markers, bone mineral density or lipid levels [65].

in a programme aimed at searching for novel 5␣-reductase
inhibitors a series of c-17-acylurea-substituted 4-azasteroids
(28–33) (table 3) were synthesized by di salle et al. in early 1990s
exploiting the tolerance of functionality at this position. signiﬁcantly greater potency was found with the derivative containing
c-4 methyl group and a saturated a-ring [66].

observation that selectivity of inhibitors can be increased
against type i isozyme by making correct choice of hydrophobic
substituent at c-17 position led to development of various 17␤-(nureylene-n,n -disubstituted)-4-methyl-4-aza-3-one 5␣-reductase
derivatives (table 4) (38–43) as 5␣-reductase inhibitors as they
have potent selectivity against 5␣-reductase type i enzyme. azasteroids with n-cyclopropyl ring exhibit potent inhibitory activity
against type i 5␣-reductase. increase in the chain length from n ethyl to n -butyl the compound showed strong inhibitory activity
while branching of alkyl chain decreased potency of compounds
and introduction of 1,2-double bond signiﬁcantly reduced the
activity. replacement of n -alkyl chain with phenyl moiety gave
the most active compound (41) of the series [68].

one of the most potent compound of this group, turosteride
(30), a close analogue of 4-ma (12), but unlike 4-ma was found
to be devoid of binding at the rat  xxxg183xxx  and a weak
inhibitor of 3␤-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase [67].
other azasteroids which retained 5␣-reductase inhibitory
activity are 2-substituted (34), a-homo- (35) and 19-nor- (36)
analogues [41].

from the studies that 17␤-carboxamides at c-17 position
have pronounced activity of 5␣-reductase and possess  xxxg183xxx  activities, a number of 17␤-(n-alkyl/aryl formamido)
(44–49) and 17␤-[(n-alkyl/aryl)alkyl)aryl amido]-3-oxo-4-aza5␣-steroids (50–54) were prepared from 17␤-hydroxy-4-azasteroids and were evaluated as 5␣-reductase inhibitors by li et al.
(tables 5 and 6). structure activity relationship indicated that 5␣reductase type i enzyme has preference for n-substituted linear
alkyl side chain of 4–5 carbon atoms. n-amyl substituted 17␤formamide (45) was found to be one of the most promising inhibitor
of 5␣-reductase type i while n-heptyl (48) and n-octyl (49) showed
dual inhibition of both isozymes of 5␣-reductase (table 5).

derivatives (table 6) exhibited highly potent inhibitory activity for
human 5␣-reductase type i [69].

various 7␤-substituted derivatives have also been prepared.
preliminary screening of the compounds as inhibitors of 5␣reductase from human scalp and prostate revealed that the
presence of 7␤-methyl substitution in ring b, presence of cholesterol type side chain at c-17 and ketone functionalities at c-3
in 4-azasteroids resulted in potent selective inhibitor against 5␣reductase type i [70].

(n-(2-cyano-2-propyl)-3-oxo-4-aza-5␣-androst-1-ene-17␤carboxamide) (74) (table 13), a novel inhibitor of 5␣-reductase
and structurally related to finasteride (13) was found to be 10
times more potent than finasteride in reducing prostate weight of
rat [78].

in 1996, ishibashi et al. reported the synthesis of various
11␣-acetoxy, 11␣-hydroxy, 11␤-hydroxy and 11-oxo substituted
4-aza-5␣-androstane analogues (75–79) with a diphenylmethylcarbamoyl moiety at c-17 and their evaluation. compounds with an
11␤-hydroxy or 11-oxo showed inhibitory activities comparable to
finasteride (13). the 4-methyl 11␤-hydroxy-4-aza-5␣-androstane
derivative (77) was found to be most potent against rat and human
enzyme and more active than finasteride (13) (table 14) [79].

merck in 1997 reported the synthesis of several 4-aza 5␣androstan-3-one 17␤-(n-substituted carboxamides) (80–85) as
potent human type ii 5␣-reductase inhibitors. from the studies it
was indicated that the 17-amide n substituent included aromatic
residue potent dual inhibitors of type i and type ii 5␣-reductase
were obtained (table 15).

the addition of n4 -methyl substituent in a-ring increases
human  xxxg183xxx  afﬁnity while addition of unsaturation
to the a-ring (1 ) increased human  xxxg183xxx  binding.
the unsubstituted carbanilides in the 1 -n4 -methyl series showed
some selectivity for type i 5␣-reductase over type ii enzyme.
whereas addition of aryl substitution at the 2-position increased
type ii 5␣-reductase binding, thus providing dual inhibitors with
excellent human  xxxg183xxx  binding. compound (87) was
found to be the most potent inhibitor from this series (table 16)
[80].

in 2000, lerner and coworkers reported the synthesis of
haptens 91(a,b) and 92(a,b) which belongs to 4-aza steroids.
the resulting 5␣-dihydrotestosterone was shown to be the more
potent intracellular hormone [82].
in 1998, salle et al. reported synthesis of a novel compound pnu
157706 [n-(1,1,1,3,3,3-hexaﬂuorophenylpropyl)-3-oxo-4-aza-5␣androst-1-ene-17␤-carboxamide] (90) as a potent dual type i and
type ii 5␣-reductase inhibitor. pnu 157706 (90) was found to
reduce prostate weight 16-fold than finasteride (13) while the ed50
values being 0.12 and 1.9 mg/kg/day, respectively (table 17) [81].

menzenbach et al. reported the synthesis of several 17methylene-4-azasteroids as inhibitors of 5␣-reductase. azaestranone ii (93) was found to be inhibitor of 5␣-reductase with
ic50 = 34 × 10−10 (for prostate) and ic50 = 25 × 10−10 (for seminal
vesicle) [83].

tural and charge polarization features of the transition state for the
enzyme catalyzed transfer of hydride from nadph to testosterone.
the higher reduction potential of ketoenamine compared to that of
␣,␤-unsaturated ketone prevents these compounds from acting as
substrates for 5␣-reductase and they show slow offset inhibition
instead of irreversible as shown by 4-azasteroids [53]. structure
activity relationship has also been reported by frye and associates
at c-4, n-6 and c-17 carbamoyl (fig. 5) [43,84].
initially a set of n-6, c-1, c-2, c-4 substituted derivatives of 6aza-androst-4-en-3-ones (94–101) were prepared to explore the
structure activity relationship of a- and b-rings versus type i and
type ii 5␣-reductase (table 18).

methylation at n-6 (95) and substitution of c-4 with small
lipophilic groups such as cl (96), br (97) and ch3 (98) increases type
i 5␣-reductase activity selectivity 4-fold while type i 5␣-reductase
activity was decreased by unsaturation (99), 1,2 cycloproponation
(100) and c-2-methylation (101).
by careful optimization of the c-17 substituent along with combining a- and b-ring substitutions, potent dual inhibitors of both
isozymes of 5␣ reductase were obtained (102–114) (table 19) [84].

122

s. aggarwal et al. / steroids 75 (2010) 109–153

it was found that optimizing c-17 group resulted in 5␣reductase type i inhibitory activity in 103 with 5–7-fold increase
of activity in 105. swapping a methyl ester (106) for an admantyl
ester (108) provides selectivity towards 5␣-reductase i. preparation
of analogues of 103 resulted in compounds (109–112) which were
found to be 16–200-fold selectivity towards type i 5␣-reductase.
compounds (103, 111, 113 and 114) having ketone at c-17 proved
extremely potent inhibitors of type i 5␣-reductase. out of the
group, compound (105) demonstrated efﬁcacy equivalent to finasteride (13) in a castrated rat model of dht dependent prostate
growth. in general, large lipophilic groups at c-17 provides selectivity against 5␣-reductase i.

a variety of c-17 amide-substituted 6-aza-androst-4-en-3-ones
were prepared and evaluated against human type i and type ii
steroid 5␣-reductase in order to optimize potency versus both
isozymes of 5␣-reductase. out of the study two series of potent and
selective c-17 amides were discovered, 2,5-disubstituted anilides
and (arylcycloalky1) amides (115–121) (table 20). evaluation of
some optimal compounds from this series in a chronic castrated
rat model of 5␣-reductase inhibitor induced prostate involution,
and pharmacokinetic measurements identiﬁed compounds (117,
118, 120 and 121) with good in vivo efﬁcacy and half-life in the dog
[85].

b-homologated analogue of 17␤-n, n -diethylcarboxy-6-azaandrost-4-en-3-one (122) has also been found to be potent
inhibitor of 5␣-reductase inhibitor with ic50 = 318 nm [86].

fang and sharp in 1996 synthesized several 6-azaandrostenones
of the general structure (127) as 5␣-reductase inhibitors [89].

bergmann et al. synthesised 7-substituted ␦-4-6-azasteroid
derivatives (123) as 5␣-reductase inhibitors [87]. but activity data
was not reported for these compounds.

16␤-aryloxy, -alkoxy and heteroaryloxy 6-azasteroids of the
general formula as given below were synthesised by aster et al. and
the compounds were found to be potent inhibitors of 5␣-reductase
[90]. compound (128) was found to be potent inhibitor of human
5␣-reductase type i with ic50 in the range of 0.1–1000 nm.

straight or branched alkyl, ar is phenyl, x is o, n or s, het is
piperidinyl, piperizinyl, pirrolidinyl, pyrrolyl, etc.
6-azacholesten-3-ones (table 21) were assayed against both
type i and type ii 5␣-reductase by haffner [88]. all three compounds were found to be potent dual inhibitors of 5␣-reductase.
unlike the 4-azasteroids the cholesterol side chain imparts very
little selectivity between type i and type ii 5␣-reductase. it was
also found that c-7 methyl group might provide a potent 5␣reductase i selective compound. the ␣-c-7 methyl diastereomer
(124) proved to be 7-fold more active 5␣-reductase i inhibitor
than ␤-diastereomer (125).

rahier and taton have reported synthesis of several novel 6aza-b-homosteroids but they were not tested for 5␣-reductase
inhibitory activity [91]. later in 2000 and 2001, wenge et al.
[92] and xie et al. described the synthesis of 6-azasteroids as

several 8-azasteroids have been synthesized [97] and discussed
as antifungal agents [98,99] but none has been reported as 5␣reductase inhibitor.
9. 9-azasteroids
no work has been published on 9-aza steroids as 5␣-reductase
inhibitor although some fungicides have been known from this
category [100].
10. 19-nor-10-azasteroids
on the basis of the molecular model of active site for type ii
isozyme and to increase the activity and selectivity of compounds
towards both 5␣-reductase type i and 5␣-reductase type ii.
guarna et al. synthesized a novel class of compounds 19-nor-10azasteroids (tables 22 and 23) [101].

best results were obtained with 9:1 mixture of 9(11) (133)
and 8(9) (134) 17 ␤-(n-tert-butyl carbamoyl)-19-nor-10-aza4- xxxd2618xxx -3-one as it was found to be a good inhibitor of
5␣-reductase type i and 5␣-reductase type ii. the enamine structure of ring a of 10-aza-steroid (136) is analogous to that of the
substrate like transition state. the presence of n atom at position
10 increases the nucleophilic character of the carbonyl group and
stabilizes the carbocation intermediate (137) by delocalization at
the positive charge.

the inhibitory potency of these compounds depends on the
presence of bridgehead n-10 atom conjugated with 4-en-3-one
moiety in a-ring, unsaturation in c-ring and substituent at c17 position. 19-nor-10-aza steroids have low transitional barrier
energy values and more ﬂexible as compared to 6-aza or 4azasteroids [102].

some 10a-azasteroids were also synthesized from fusidic acid
but were not evaluated for 5␣-reductase inhibitors [103]. guarna
et al. also synthesized 17␤-[n-(phenyl) methyl/phenyl-amido]
substituted 10-azasteroids. unexpectedly, 5␤-h compounds were
found more active than their 5␣-h counterparts, with (138)
(ic50 = 279 and 2000 nm toward isoenzymes i and ii, respectively)
and (139) (ic50 = 913 and 247 nm toward isoenzymes i and ii,

s. aggarwal et al. / steroids 75 (2010) 109–153

125

respectively) being the most potent compounds of the series
[104].

11. 11-, 12a-, 13-azasteroids
though many 11-azasteroids [105–107], 12a-azasteroids [108]
and 13-azasteroids [109] have been prepared but 5␣-reductase
inhibitory activities have not been reported.
12. 15- and 16-azasteroids
many 15-azasterols have been synthesized as antifungal agents
[110–112] but none of them have been evaluated for 5␣-reductase
inhibitory activity. 16-azasteroids have been synthesized but none
of the compound has evolved as 5␣-reductase inhibitor [113,114].
13. 17- and 17a-aza-d-homosteroids
regan and hayes, in their exemplary work, have synthesized several 17- and 17a-aza-d-homosteroids from several
17-ketosteroid oximes [115]. but 17a-azasteroids attracted more
attention when chandonium diiodide was established as a potent
neuromuscular blocker [116]. 17 and 17a-azasteroids have been
found to possess numerous biological activities like gamma amino
butyric acid (gaba) receptor antagonistic [117–119], antifungal
[120], antineoplastic, mutagenic [121,122] and anti-inﬂammatory

inhibitors has shown that steroids without side chains can bind to
enzymes with the a-ring of the substance simulating the d-ring of
the substrate, while the d-ring emulates the a-ring. this could lead
to 17-d-homo-azasteroids exhibiting same mechanism of action as
4-azasteroids. however, up to now, research has been concentrated
on 4-azasteroids as 5␣-reductase inhibitors and 17a-azasteroids
remained unexplored avenue as far as their 5␣-reductase inhibitory
activity is concerned. some 17a-azasteroids (149–152) evaluated
for 5␣-reductase inhibitory activity are summarized in the table 24
[124].

14. diazasteroids
activity [123]. the most interesting aspect concerning 17-d-homoazasteroids is the possibility of “inverted action” or “backbinding”
as proposed by macdonald et al. [124]. their proposition was based
on the fact that the steroids have the potential to bind in two
orientations in the active site of various metabolizing enzymes.
marcus and talalay [125] ﬁrst reported that 3(17) ␤-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase converts both t (1) and dehydroepiandrosterone
(141) to  xxxd176xxx  (140) (fig. 6a). other examples
of enzyme inhibition by inverted steroids have also appeared. the
oxiranes 143 and 144 were found to be active site-directed, irreversible inhibitors of 3-oxo-5 -steroid isomerase (fig. 6b) [126]
and the bromoacetates 147 and 148 act as afﬁnity labels for estradiol 17␤-dehydrogenase (fig. 6c) [127]. research on 5␣-reductase

eberbach and coworkers reported in 1996 a novel access to
4,13-diazasteroid derivatives but they were not evaluated for 5␣reductase activity [128]. in the same year stuart et al. ﬁrst reported
4,17-diazasteroids as potential inhibitors of 5␣-reductase. the
finasteride 17-aza-isomer (153) proved to be potent inhibitor
of 5␣-reductase ii although less active than finasteride (13) and
its congeners. 4-methylation (154) lowered the inhibition of the
5␣-reductase ii enzyme. removal of 1(2) unsaturation led to the
formation of compound (155) that is dual inhibitor of 5␣-reductase
type i and type ii and 4-methylation of 155 led to the increase in
activity in 156. while compound with 5(6) (157) showed only a
moderate inhibition of 5␣-reductase ii activity (table 25) [129].

126

s. aggarwal et al. / steroids 75 (2010) 109–153

8,13-diaza steroids were also synthesized by göndös et al. in
1998 but not evaluated for 5␣-reductase inhibitory activity [130].
15. 11,13,15-triazasteroids
hirota et al. reported in 1995 the synthesis of 11,13,15triazasteroid derivatives to investigate antidepressive activity.
these analogues were also evaluated for anti-platelet aggregation activity and some derivatives exhibited positive action but no
5␣-reductase activity has been investigated in these categories of
steroids [131].
16. b,d-dihomo-azasteroids
several steroidal b,d-dihomolactam have been synthesized and
evaluated for antitumour activity but no 5␣-reductase activity has
been reported from this group till date [132,133].
17. des-ab-azasteroids
trehan et al. synthesized des-ab-azasteroids but 5␣-reductase
activity studies were not done [134].
steroidal 5␣-reductase inhibitors which are extranuclear, i.e. in
which nitrogen is not the part of steroidal nucleus but forms part
of the side chain or attached group have also been explored as 5␣reductase inhibitors, therefore are discussed next.

unsaturation in the b- and d-rings, and in the c-17 carboxamide
alkyl groups. despite lacking c-19 methyl group these compounds
were found to be potent inhibitors of 5␣-reductase [138].

18. steroidal 3-carboxylic/phosphonic/phosphinic acids
a number of 3-androstene-3-carboxylic acids (158–166)
(table 26) were designed to mimic the putative enzyme-bound
enolate intermediate by incorporating sp2 -hybridized centers at
c-3 and c-4 and, most critically, an anionic carboxylic acid at
c-3 as a charged replacement for the enolate oxyanion. because
of presumably favorable electrostatic interaction between the
carboxylate and the positively charged oxidized cofactor, the
acrylate preferentially binds in a ternary complex with enzyme
and nadp+ , which leads to the uncompetitive kinetic mechanism
[135–137]. activity is enhanced in analogues possessing an additional unsaturation at c-5 (162–167) along with 3 -unsaturation.
at c-17, diisopropyl (158) and pivalyl (163) amides were optimal.
epristeride (sk&f 105657) (163) entered the clinical trials for
treatment of bph and is a potent inhibitor of 5␣-reductase ii while
a weak inhibitor of 5␣-reductase i.

a series of estratriene-3-carboxylic acids containing an aromatic
a-ring had also been synthesized (167–171) (table 27) with structural variations in the c-2 and c-4 substituents, in the degrees of

nitro derivatives also showed interesting structure activity
relationship patterns compared to carboxylic acids, compound
(172) was found to be potent competitive inhibitor by binding to
e-nadph complex [139]. the sulphonic acid (173) [140], phosphonic acid (174) and phosphinic acid (175) also proved to be the
potent inhibitors of human 5␣-reductase but not so of rat 5␣reductase [141]. the afﬁnities of phosphonic acid are relatively
less than phosphinic acid derivatives because the increased bulk
at the 3-substituent, leading to a steric intolerance for binding to
enzyme. overall 3-phosphosteroids were weaker inhibitors than
their corresponding steroidal-3-carboxy steroids. the function of

the c-3-moiety is presumably to act as an h-bond acceptor from a
residue in the enzyme, which would normally donate a hydrogen
bond to stabilize the enolate. since the negatively charged groups
(co2 − ) or isosteres of the carboxylate (no2 ) best mimic this
interaction it indicates that a pka -matched h-bond with a lys or
arg donor may be operative. in addition, an interaction between
the negatively charged c-3-moiety and the positively charged
nadp+ cofactor after the enzyme has turned over substrate is
possible, especially if the cofactor lies directly under the a-ring of
the steroidal skeleton in the transition state and mimics thereof.
compound 176 was not as active due to the presence of alcoholic
group as it was not able to provide sufﬁcient negative charge and
hence was a weak inhibitor of rat and human 5␣-reductase.

19. diazoketone steroids
the primary evidence of a dramatic increase in the afﬁnity of 5␣reductase and an inhibitor with a 5-juncture of a-/b-ring and sp2
hybridization at the c-3 and c-4 positions was obtained from the
inhibition with a mechanism-based inhibitor (5,20r)-4-diazo-21hydroxy-20-methyl-pregn-6-en-3-one (177) (rmi-18,341). diazoketone (177) had been reported to be a potent time-dependent
inhibitor with a ki of 35 nm (time-dependency is considered indicative of irreversibility) [142].

a mechanism of inhibition was proposed that the protonation
steps implicated in the normal enzymatic transformation activates
the diazoketone functionality to a diazonium ion that could further
alkylate some nucleophilic residue at the active site [143].

20. 4-substituted steroids
the observation that an excellent inhibitor possessed a conjugated system (sp2 –sp2 –sp2 ) at c-3, c-4, and c-5 positions
of a-ring of steroids together with a lipophilic group at c-17,
a range of 4-substituted-3-oxo-4-androstene-17(-carboxamides
(180–183) (table 28) were prepared and compared with the

finasteride (13). out of these 4-cyano compounds were found
to be potent inhibitors of 5␣-reductase type ii enzyme and
substitution with groups like thiol led to decreased activity.
this series of compounds were also found to be potent androgen antagonists [144]. fei et al. carried out the synthesis of
some novel 4-triﬂuoromethylsteroids and proposed them as novel
5␣-reductase inhibitors. out of the series 4-triﬂuoromethyl-n-(tbutyl)-4- xxxd2618xxx -17␤-carboxamide (184) emerged as the most
potent inhibitor being 4 times more active than finasteride (13)

[145]. 4-cyanoprogesterone (185) was also found to be a potent
inhibitor of both rat and human 5␣-reductase enzymes (ic50 values = 0.045 and 0.050 ␮m, respectively). the mechanism of action of
4-cyano steroidal inhibitor was assumed to be the transition state
inhibitor because on reduction by the enzyme compound would
form a stable 5–3-enol that would remain tightly bound to the
active site [146,147].

21. steroidal oximes
a number of pregnenolone (186–190) and progesterone
(191–194)-based steroids were synthesized bearing a oxime group
connected directly or via a spacer to the steroidal d-ring, capable to
form a coordinate bond with haeme iron of enzyme 5␣-reductase.
in contrast to the pregnenolone derivatives which showed no inhibition of 5␣-reductase isozyme i and ii, progesterone derivatives
possessed marked inhibition towards type ii.

129

transferring the oxime group from positions 20 to 21
caused an increased selectivity toward type ii isozyme. z-21hydroxyiminopregn-4-en-3-one (195) was found to be a potential
inhibitor of the type ii (ic50 = 1.95 ␮m against human type i and
0.30 ␮m against human type ii).

inhibitory potency of synthesized compounds against target
enzyme using whole cell assay revealed that c-20 oxime (191) displayed strong inhibition against both isozymes (ic50 = 1.63 against
human type i and 0.58 ␮m against human type ii). unsaturation
in ring d (192 and 193) in conjugation with oxime group further
enhances inhibitory activity. almost complete loss of activity has
been found toward type i in the derivative with keto group at c-6
(194).

however, none of the compounds showed activity near to that
of the reference drug finasteride (13) (ic50 values being 45 and
3 nm for type i and type ii, respectively, in the corresponding study)
[148].
22. steroidal tetrahydrooxazin-2-ones
wölﬁng et al. synthesized a novel series of steroidal
tetrahydrooxazin-2-ones (196–201) containing heterocycles

130

s. aggarwal et al. / steroids 75 (2010) 109–153

involving o and n heteroatoms at position 17␤ of androst-4-en3-one, respectively, as 5␣-reductase inhibitors. the ic50 values of
compounds vary between 270 and 600 nm. the relative inhibitory
effect of the unsubsituted n-phenyl compound 196 is 0.20. concerning the effects of substituents at position 4 of the phenyl
ring in 196, the introduction of an ethyl (197) or ethoxy (199)
group resulted in a weak enhancement of 5␣-reductase inhibition.
substitution with halogens (200 and 201) or methoxy (198) caused
lowering of inhibition ability [149].

certain 19-nor analogues have also been synthesized in order to
improve the inhibitory activity in 16-methylated derivatives. tsaa291 (16-ethyl-17␤-hydroxy-4-estren-3-one) (208) was found to be
the ﬁrst anti-androgen known to have  xxxd2082xxx  of competitive
inhibition of 5␣-reductase activity and  xxxg183xxx  complex
formation. it showed a ki of 1400 nm to the puriﬁed nuclei from rat
prostatic tissues [151].

24. 6-methylene steroidal derivatives

steroid 5␣-reductase inhibitors that do not contain any nitrogen
either as part of ring or extranuclear but yet found to inhibit 5␣reductase are discussed next.
23. 16-substituted steroids
a series of 16-methyl substituted derivatives of androst-4ene and estr-4-ene originally prepared as antiandrogens, were
tested for their inhibitory activity on rat and human prostatic
5␣-reductase. the inhibitory activity data indicated that ic50
increases in sequence in derivatives bearing 16␣-methyl (203),
16␤-methyl (204) and 16,16-dimethyl substituents (205). acylation of 17-hydroxy group signiﬁcantly increases the inhibitory
potency (ic50 (207) = 4.8 nm, ic50 (206) = 23.5 nm in rat prostate
and ic50 (207) = 0.52 nm, ic50 (206) = 0.62 nm in human prostate).
overall, in human prostate homogenates ic50 varies between 0.6
and 120 ␮m while in rat prostate it ranges from 1.6 to 1000 ␮m.
this shows enzyme of human prostate is more sensitive than
that of rat prostate to methyl substituted compounds. overall
16-methyl steroids were found to be weak inhibitors both in rat
and human enzymes compared to the existing ones [150].

2 ,3 ␣-tetrahydrofuran-2 -spiro-17-(6-methylene-4androsten-3-one) (209; l612,710) is a potent time-dependent
inhibitor which causes the highest percentage of inhibition (81%)
of rat prostatic 5␣-reductase enzyme. the structure activity
relationship showed that 3-oxo-4-ene functionally was essential
to the inhibitory activity and that substituents at c-17 inﬂuenced
the inhibitory potency. the presence of the c-19 methyl group was
not essential to the activity. the a-ring appeared to interact with
the entire active site of the enzyme. furthermore, the afﬁnity of an
inhibitor to the enzyme was greatly enhanced by the introduction
of a methylene group at c-6 whereas activity was completely lost
with a large radical such as iodomethylene group at c-7. thus a
series of 6-methylene steroids were prepared and examined as
irreversible inhibitors of rat prostatic 5␣-reductase [152]. another
6-methylene steroid that is potent inhibitor due to priming
of its dienone group by electrophilic activation toward nucleophilic attack at the 6-methylene group is having structure (210)
[153].

25. seco steroids
(4r)-5,10-seco-estra-4,5-diene-3,10,17-trione (211) and (4r)5,10-seco-19-nor-pregna-4,5-diene-3,10, xxxd103xxx  (212) were
ﬁrst found to be non-competitive and possibly irreversible
inhibitors of epididymal 5␣-reductase. radiographic crystallography studies of both compounds showed that the conjugated
allenic 3-oxo-5,10-secosteriod (211) has a conformation similar to
that of the normal tetracyclic steroid dione. both compounds were
non-competitive inhibitors of 5␣-reductase and have an afﬁnity
label for the enzyme with ki of 5470 and 980 nm, respectively
[154,155].

26. derivatives of natural substrate: pregnane
as a consequence of the important observation that progesterone and deoxycortisone inhibits the synthesis of dihydrotestosterone by competing with 4-en-3-one function of the
testosterone for the 5␣-reductase enzyme it led voigt and coworkers to synthesize number of progesterone derivatives [37,38]. the
satisfactory result of 4-cyano-progesterone (185) [146], which

possessed marked inhibitory activity for 5␣-reductase enzyme,
stimulated great deal of interest to synthesize various 4- and
6-halo-progesterone analogs (213–217). these compounds were
found to be potent antiandrogenic in nature when tested against
gonadectomized hamster seminal vesicles and were also found to
be inhibitors of 5␣-reductase [156–158].

132

s. aggarwal et al. / steroids 75 (2010) 109–153

bratoeff et al. evaluated the antiandrogenic and 5␣-reductase
inhibitory activity of various 16-phenyl substituted-d-homo
compounds (218–219), 16-methyl substituted steroids (220–222),
4-bromo compound (223) without a methyl group at c-16 and the
epoxy compounds (224–225). compounds 219, 222 and 223 were
found to possess both antiandrogenic and 5␣-reductase inhibitory
activity better than the finasteride (13) [158,159]. the trienones
having a more coplanar structure reacts faster with the nucleophilic portion of the enzyme in a michael type addition reaction
to form an irreversible adduct with a concomitant inhibition of the
enzyme 5␣-reductase than the dienones.

a range of 4-bromo-17-substituted-4-pregnene-3,20 diones
were also synthesized and evaluated as 5␣-reductase inhibitors
on gonadectomized hamster seminal vesicle and ﬂank organs.
small diameter of the pigmented ﬂank organ and great reduction
in the weight of seminal vesicle has been found with the compounds having p-ﬂuorobenzoyloxy (226) and p-chlorobenzoyloxy
(227) indicating that the presence of more electronegative substituent at c-17 position (p-halosubstituted phenyl) and halogen at
c-4 enhances the antiandrogenic activity as well as 5␣-reductase
inhibitory activity [160,161].

several new pregnane derivatives were also synthesized and
evaluated by the conversion of [3 h] t to [3 h] dht in penicillium
crustosum broths and the conversion of [1,2-14 c] sodium acetate
into lipids. compounds 228 and 229 were found out to be potent
5␣-reductase inhibitors as they inhibit conversion of t to dht and
also decreased the incorporation of radiolabeled sodium acetate
into lipids of the ﬂank organs [162].

receptor. the appropriate homologues extended by a methylene
group at c-6 (233–236) showed better activity due to the presence of exocyclic double bond that can react faster with the enzyme
in a michael type addition reaction than the corresponding endocyclic diene. compounds 233 and 234 showed ic50 values of 19 and
100 nm, respectively [164,165].

cabeza et al. also reported the 5␣-reductase inhibitory activity and the antiandrogenic effect of novel 16-bromo substituted
trienedione, 16␤ methyl substituted dienedione and the trienedione (230–232). compounds 230 and 231 were found to exhibit
5␣-reductase inhibitory activity higher than the commercially
available finasteride (13) [163].

the in vitro inhibitory activity of some novel progesterone
derivatives was also determined and they were evaluated as
5␣-reductase inhibitors as well as antagonists for the androgen

in compound 237 which is an epoxy compound the nucleophilic
enzyme attacked the electrophilic center at c-6 and in this process
inhibits the enzyme. several 3-substituted 4-pregnene-6,20-dione
derivatives (238–246) have been synthesized and were evaluated
for antiandrogenic as well as 5␣-reductase inhibitory activity. the
synthesized steroids have an ␣,␤-unsaturated carbonyl moiety
in common. it was found that accessible electrophilic ␤-carbon
of an ␣,␤-unsaturated carbonyl moiety reacted very readily with
a variety of nucleophiles to form michael adducts. the ﬁrst step
involved the formation of an enzyme-steroid activated complex
and in a subsequent step the nucleophilic portion of the enzyme
(amino group) attacked the conjugated double bond of the steroid
in a michael type addition reaction to form an irreversible adducts
[166].

134

s. aggarwal et al. / steroids 75 (2010) 109–153

the ic50 values of the compounds were found to increase progressively as the substituent on the phenyl group of the ester
side chain at c-3 became more electropositive, i.e. compound
241 has an ic50 value of 3.0 nm as compared to compound
243 which has an ic50 value of 4.0 nm. on the other hand the
compounds (244–246) having saturated 4-pregnene-6,20-dione
skeleton for, e.g. 245 exhibited higher ic50 value (3.7 nm) as compared to the unsaturated ones (240–243) for, e.g. 241 with a
value of 3.0 nm. it was also found that the presence of halogen substituents in ester moiety at c-3 as well as double bond
at c-16 increased the binding afﬁnity for the  xxxg183xxx 
[167].
several new progesterone derivatives were also synthesized by
the same group having dienone moiety as reported earlier. some of
them (247–248) were found to have high 5␣-reductase inhibitory
activity like 248 showing an ic50 value of 0.5 nm as compared to
finasteride (13) showing an ic50 value of 8.5 nm in the same study
[168,169].

bratoeff et al. synthesized two novel steroidal carbamates
(249–250) which are the esters of carbamic acid with substituents
at the amino and esters ends (nhrcoor1 ) and proposed them
as novel class of inhibitors for human and hamster steroid 5␣reductase. these compounds have a longer half-life and are
hydrolyzed slowly in the liver due to which they have a better pharmacological activity when compared to the conventional esters.
compound 249 has got a similar ic50 value (10 nm) as that of finasteride (8.5 nm) (13) while compound 250 has a higher ic50 value of
about 50 nm apparently due to the presence of large bromine atom
[170].

working on similar lines some more novel 4,16-pregnadiene6,20-dione derivatives were synthesized and evaluated as 5␣reductase inhibitors. in this work, it has been demonstrated that
compounds containing chlorine (251), bromine (252), iodine (253)
atoms, and (254); without any substituent in the ester moiety) at c3 produce a signiﬁcant decrease of the prostate weight in castrated
animals treated with testosterone (1). therefore, it was proposed
that the ester moiety at c-3 is functioning as a pharmacophore,

enriched by the presence of halogens in these steroidal derivatives
leading to the increase in the inhibition of 5␣-reductase enzyme
as determined by the ic50 values. compound 252 was found to be
most potent with an ic50 value of 1.8 nm while compounds 251
and 253 showed values 14 and 10 nm, respectively, in comparison
to finasteride (13) having value 8.5 nm. compound 254 was not

that active when compared to halogenated compounds thus
further demonstrating the need of a halogen atom in the ester side
chain [171].

recently, cabeza et al. synthesized several c-6 substituted and
unsubstituted pregnane derivatives as potential 5␣-reductase
inhibitors. it has been found that steroids that lack a chlorine
atom in c-6 (255–257) exhibited a higher capacity for inhibition of
the activity of 5␣-reductase (ic50 in the range of 25–63 nm) than
the compounds (258–260) having this atom (ic50 in the range
of 920–990 nm in comparison to finasteride (13) having an ic50
8.5 nm). the presence of bromine atom in c-6 of compound 261
however doesn’t affect the inhibitory activity of enzyme (ic50
being 33 nm). also, the presence of an ester moiety in c-17 ␣
on the steroidal skeleton tends to increase the inhibition of the
activity of the enzyme [172].

s. aggarwal et al. / steroids 75 (2010) 109–153

27. non-steroidal 5␣-reductase inhibitors
a number of classes of non-steroidal inhibitors of 5␣-reductase
have now been identiﬁed. it was anticipated that the use of nonsteroidal template can decrease the potential interaction with other
enzyme or receptor of the steroidal endocrine system and can limit
the complexity of target compound synthesis [173]. they have in
fact emerged either from the design of compounds mimic of azasteroidal inhibitors, generally by the formal removing of one or more
rings from the azasteroidal structure or by early non-steroidal lead
(ono-3805) (261) which was prepared as leukotriene synthesis
inhibitor [174] or by high throughput screening. these compounds are generally thought to act all as competitive inhibitors
vs. testosterone with exception of the epristeride analogues which
are uncompetitive inhibitors. non-steroidal inhibitors include
benzo[f]quinolinones, pyridones and quinolinones which were
mimics of 4-azasteroid inhibitors. benzo[c]quinolinones were synthesized as mimics of 6-azasteroids while benzo[c]quinolizinones
were designed as mimics of 10-azasteroids. the most potent and
selective inhibitors of human type i 5␣-reductase are found among
these classes of compounds. almost all the other non-steroidal
inhibitors can be grouped as carboxylic acid (generally butanoic
acid) derivatives which are thought to act as non-competitive
inhibitors versus testosterone in analogy to ono 3805 (261).

135

general octahydro derivatives are more potent inhibitors than the
corresponding 4a–10a unsaturated compounds (tables 29 and 30)
and in both series the potency toward type i 5␣-reductase increases
if an halogen atom is present at position 8 (in particular a cl atom)
and a methyl group at position 4; in fact the most potent inhibitor
of the series is ly191704 (268) with ic50 = 8 nm (table 30). this
molecule has progressed into human clinical trials.

28. mimics of 4-azasteroids: benzo[f]quinolinones
benzo[f]quinolinones were the ﬁrst non-steroidal inhibitors
prepared by the lilly’s researchers. they were derived by the
removal of the d-ring from 4-azasteroids and replacing the c-ring
with an aromatic one [175]. most of these compounds are type i
selective, although dual inhibitors can be obtained if an appropriate substitution is present at the position 8 on the aromatic ring.
two main classes of benzo[f]quinolinones have been described,
the hexahydro derivatives (262–265), which have an unsaturation
at positions 4a–10a, and the octahydro derivatives (266–271). in

the quantitative structure activity relationship study of these
compounds has focused on the effect of 8 substituent on the aromatic ring, which can be accounted for by its lipophilic character
[176]. they found that the optimum activity may reside in the property space around the chlorine substituent. the substitution of the
8-cl atom by a f (270) or a br atom (271) decreased very slightly the
potency. finally, several kinds of substituents, including complex
aromatic groups, were introduced at the position 8 [177], and some
potent type i selective inhibitors such as compounds 272–274 were
prepared.

136

s. aggarwal et al. / steroids 75 (2010) 109–153

29. pyridones, quinolinones and piperidines
abell et al. synthesized a number of tricyclic thiolactams
(275–276), aryl acid (277), bicyclic lactams (278–281) and bicyclic
thiolactam (282) and evaluated them in vitro as inhibitors of type
i and type ii steroid 5␣-reductase (table 31). removal of two
or more rings from 4-azasteroids resulted in a strong decrease
of potency. the tricyclic thiolactams were found to be selective
type i 5␣-reductase inhibitors and in general were less active

than the corresponding lactams. the aryl acid 277 showed good
dual isozyme inhibitory properties with signiﬁcantly enhanced
type ii activity. bicyclic lactams, in general, were found to be less
active against type i 5␣-reductase than the tricycles. for example,
compounds (278–279), lacking the b and d steroidal rings, were
poor type i 5␣-reductase inhibitors, with the highest potency
associated to the presence of the cl atom on the aromatic ring of
279 [178]. a styryl (or azo) substituent dramatically enhances type
ii activity (and indeed type i activity with the bicycles) (280–281)
and provided dual inhibitors of type i and type ii.

their poor potency however illustrates the need for both a- and
b-rings to be present with the correct fusion pattern for good recognition at the enzyme active site. a series of 5-phenyl substituted
1-methyl-2-pyridones have also been prepared and tested against
human and rat 5␣-reductase type i and type ii. compound 285
bearing bulky carboxamide substituents exhibited excellent 5␣reductase type ii inhibitory activity with ic50 value of 10 ␮m [182].

hartmann and coworkers synthesized pyridones of the general
formula 283 and 284 where the b- and c-rings of the steroid system have been replaced by an acyclic linker but these compounds
display relatively weak activity versus both the rat and human 5␣reductase isozymes (ki > 20 ␮m) [179–181].
mccarthy and coworkers have recently synthesized a series of
4 -substituted 5-aryl pyridones along with corresponding 1-arylpyridone derivatives and tested them against 5␣-reductase type
i and type ii expressed in transfected human embryonic kidney
cells to examine structure activity relationship for the 4 position
in pyridones.

138

s. aggarwal et al. / steroids 75 (2010) 109–153

weak inhibition was observed against the type i isozyme for
4 -n-substituted  xxxd63xxx  compounds (286–289) while potent
inhibition of type i isozyme was observed for compound 290 having
4 -benzoyl substituent and also for compounds (291–292) having
long carbon chain tethers attached to the 4 - xxxd63xxx  (table 32).
thus further proving that large hydrophobic groups are tolerated
in a region of the active site not involved in the enzymatic reaction
[183].
few quinolinone derivatives such as 6-substituted 1h-quinolin2-ones (293–294) and 2-methoxy quinolines (295–296) have also
been synthesized. the most active inhibitor for the human type
ii isozyme was 6-[4-(n,n-diisopropylcarbamoyl) phenyl]-1hquinolin-2-one 293 having ki 800 ± 85 nm, showing mostly
competitive inhibitory patterns. a type i selective inhibitor could
be identiﬁed with 6-[4-(n,n-diisopropylcarbamoyl) phenyl]n-methyl-quinolin-2-one 294 (ic50 = 510 nm) but 2-methoxy
quinolines were not found to be active [184].

hartmann and coworkers synthesized and evaluated a series of
2 -substituted 4-(4 -carboxy- or 4 -carboxymethylbenzylidene)n-acylpiperidines as active steroid 5␣-reductase type ii inhibitors.
they synthesized several compounds from n-acyl-4-benzylidenepiperidine-4 -carboxylic acids. in the dicyclohexylacetyl series,
ﬂuorination in the 2-position of the benzene nucleus (297),
exchange of the  xxxd2154xxx  by a carboxymethyl moiety (298)
and combination of both structural modiﬁcations (299) led to
highly active inhibitors of the human 5␣-reductase type ii isozyme
with ic50 values of 297, 298 and 299 being 11, 6 and 7 nm, respectively, in comparison to finasteride (13) having value of 5 nm [185].

earlier hartmann et al. have reported a series of n-substituted
piperidine-4-(benzylidine-4-carboxylic acids) (300–303) as potent
non-steroidal dual inhibitors of 5␣-reductase.

in rat, compounds 300 (ic50 = 3.44 and 0.37 ␮m for type i and
type ii, respectively) and 302 (ic50 = 0.54 and 0.69 ␮m for type i
and type ii, respectively) displayed the best inhibition toward both
isozymes. compound 301 showed a strong inhibition toward type
ii human and rat enzyme (ic50 = 60 and 80 nm) but only a moderate
activity versus type i enzyme (ic50 approximately 10 ␮m for rat and
human enzyme). compound 303 (ic50 in human type ii enzyme
being 0.26 ␮m and in rat type ii enzyme being 0.29 ␮m) was found
to be a moderate dual inhibitor probably due to higher ﬂexibility
of the open ring substituent [186].
methyl
esters
of
n-(dicyclohexyl)acetyl-piperidine-4(benzylidene-4-carboxylic acid) (304) were designed and
monitored for dual inhibition toward type ii isozyme in bph
cell free preparation and for type i isozyme in du 145 cells.
methyl esters, applied as hydrolytically stable precursor drugs to
facilitate cell permeation, will yield the corresponding carboxylic
acids as type ii inhibitors after hydrolysis in the target organ. the
esters themselves stable in human plasma and caco-2 cells act
as potent drug toward 5␣-reductase type i. thus, dual inhibition
of 5␣-reductase type i and type ii can be achieved by applying a
single parent compound [187].

benzoquinoline derivatives (267–268), novel phenanthridin-3-one
derivatives (305–307) were synthesized having vinylogous amide
pharmacophore.

although compounds were found to be 5␣-reductase type i
selective and poor inhibitors of 5␣-reductase type ii but overall
these compounds did not showed promising inhibitory activity.
the potency of compounds was found to increased from 305
(ki  10 ␮m) to 306 (ki = 1.1 ␮m) and 307 (ki = 0.92 ␮m) this was
due to the presence of methyl group on the a-ring corresponding
to the 4-me of eli lilly inhibitors. this effect is due to the presence
of hydrophobic pocket in the active site of enzyme which is able to
accommodate a small alkyl group located at the position 4 of the
a-ring of these tricyclic inhibitors [188].

31. mimics of 10-azasteroids: benzo[c] quinolizinones
guarna et al. had synthesized two series of benzo[c]quinolizin3-ones as novel inhibitors of human 5␣-reductase type i: 4ah-series
with a double bond between the positions 1 and 2 (308–311) and
1h-series with a double bond between the positions 4 and 4a
(312–317). the efﬁcacy and selectivity of these compounds
have been demonstrated on recombinant human 5␣-reductase
type i expressed in cho cells but they displayed very poor or
no inhibition towards 5␣-reductase type ii (table 33). increased
activity of the compounds of 1h-series than those of corresponding
inhibitors of 4ah-series has been attributed to the presence of
double bond enabling conjugation between carbonyl and nitrogen
atom [189–191].

the presence of a methyl group at position 4 (311, 313, 314,
and 316) associated with a substituent at position 8, gave potent
compounds in comparison with finasteride (13) and the known
5␣-reductase i selective inhibitor ly191704 (268). all compounds
inhibited the enzyme through a reversible competitive mechanism.
the structure activity relationship carried out on this class especially methyl group at positions 1, 4, 5, 6 and 8 can be summarized
as follows (fig. 7) [191].
it was found that presence of substituent at position 8, either
a chlorine or methyl group, generally increased the potency of
the inhibitors. thus compound 309 and 310 were potent were
more active than unsubstituted compound 308 in 4ah-series. similarly in 1h-series compounds 312 and 314 were more potent than
unsubstituted compounds due to presence of 8-chlorine group. the
introduction of a methyl group at position 4 was found to increase
the potency in both series with effect being higher in 1h-series. a
very strong increase of potency is observed in 8-chloro-4-methyl

derivative 314 when compared to 4-methyl unsubstituted compound 312. the substitution with a methyl group at position 6 also
affects potency in both series with effect being more prominent in
1h-series with compound 315 being more potent than unsubstituted 312. this effect of methyl substitution at position 6 seems

consistent with the observation that the introduction of the same
group on the corresponding position 7 in 4-azasteroids increased
their 5␣-reductase i selectivity [70]. presence of methyl group at
position 5 found to decrease the potency of the compounds while
introduction of methyl at position 1 as in compound 317 caused
only a slight decrease in activity when compared to unsubstituted
compound 312.
in 2001, guarna et al. studied the effect of c-ring modiﬁcations
in benzo[c]quinolizin-3-ones. they synthesized several octahydroand decahydrobenzo[c]quinolizin-3-one derivatives containing
partially or fully saturated c-ring. these compounds were found
to be selective 5␣-reductase i inhibitors. benzo[c]quinolizin-3-one
inhibitor lacking the aromatic c-ring but with a double bond at
6a–10a 318 displayed an inhibitory potency 345-fold higher than
that of the corresponding 6a–10a saturated, trans-fused compound
319 (table 34) [192].

a 3d-qsar model correlating the potency of the inhibitors with
their physicochemical features using density functional theory
(dft) was also developed for a series of benzo[c]quinolizin-3-ones
derivatives by adding two “non standard” variables (dipole moment
and log p) to the classical electrostatic and steric comparative
molecular ﬁeld analysis (comfa) ﬁelds [193].
with the aim to discover new dual non-steroidal inhibitors of
5␣-reductase i and ii a series of benzo[c]quinolizin-3-ones derivatives (320–325) bearing diverse substituents at position 8 were
synthesized in 2005 [194]. they were tested towards 5␣-reductase
i and ii expressed by chinese hamster ovary cells (cho 1827 and
cho 1829), respectively. it was found out that most potent dual
inhibitors were obtained when f atom was introduced on the phenol moiety of these esters. all compounds displayed inhibition
towards 5␣-reductase i in the range of 93–165 nm (table 35). com-

pound 322 was found to be the most potent dual inhibitor of the
series with ic50 values about 100 nm for both enzymes.

32. non-steroidal aryl acids
some novel 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene-2-carboxylic acids
(326–328) were prepared by formally removing d-ring from
parent androstene carboxylic acid inhibitors and contrary to them,
were found to be selective 5␣-reductase i inhibitors. introduction
of a bromine atom at position 7 in compound 328 gave the most
potent compound of the series. substitution by chlorine at position
7 in compound 327 does not result in increase in potency as
compared to unsubstituted compound 326. these compounds are
supposed to interact with the positively charged enzyme–nadp+
complex in an uncompetitive manner versus testosterone [195].

epristeride 163) the selectivity toward 5␣-reductase i was found
to be lost in favor of an increased potency towards 5␣-reductase ii
(table 36) [196].

on removal of two or more rings from the parent steroidal compounds several aryl acids mimics of steroidal carboxylic acids have
been synthesized (331–336). hartmann et al. synthesized several
n-substituted 4-(5-indolyl) benzoic acids but potent and selective human 5␣-reductase i inhibitors were not found from the
series. only compound 331 with ic50 value of 67 nm against human
5␣-reductase i was the most potent inhibitor [197]. similarly, compound 332 was found to possess ic50 value of 680 nm [198].

igarashi et al. synthesized a new series of indole derivatives
as potent human prostatic 5␣-reductase inhibitors. compounds
(333–336) were found to be most potent among the series with
4-[(1-benzyl-1h-indol-5-yl) oxy]-3-chlorobenzoic acid 334 having
an ic50 value of 0.44 nm while 3-chloro-4-{1-(4-phenoxybenzoyl)1h-indol-5-yl]oxy} xxxd306xxx  335 showed inhibitory activities
for both human and rat prostatic 5␣-reductase with ic50 values of
2.1 and 73 nm, respectively [199].

screening of aryl carboxylate versus the human 5␣-reductase
isozymes by smithkline-beecham company led to the discovery
of two series of selective and potent 5␣-reductase ii non-steroidal
inhibitors based on benzophenone and indolecarboxylic acids
skeleton. in benzophenone series of inhibitors the linker between
the a- and b-rings proved to be crucial whereas linker between
b- and c-rings was more tolerant of variation. both the a-ring
carboxylic acid and c-ring are critical for activity. compounds 337
and 338 were found to be most potent among the series with
ki,app being 10 and 5 nm, respectively. in indole series there was

s. aggarwal et al. / steroids 75 (2010) 109–153

a strong preference for substitution at the 5- or 6-position of the
indole ring. compounds 339 and 340 were most active among the
series with ki,app being 10 and 40 nm, respectively the structure
activity relationships of both the series are summarized as below
(figs. 8 and 9) [43,200].

that
(z)-4-{2-[[3-[1-(4,4 -diﬂuorobenzhydryl)indol-5-yl]-2pentenoyl]-amino]phenoxy}butyric acid (341,kf20405) was the
most potent compound having activity about 20 times greater
than finasteride (13) and an ic50 value of 0.48 ± 0.086 nm [201].

takami et al. synthesized various indole derivatives with
varied substituents on the ␣,␤-unsaturated double bond
and evaluated them for activity to inhibit rat prostatic
5␣-reductase. among the various derivatives they found

a novel series of indole and benzimidazole derivatives were
also synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory activity
of rat prostatic 5␣-reductase. among the series, 4-{2-[1-(4,4 dipropylbenzhydryl)indole-5-carboxamido]phenoxy}butyric acid
(342) and its benzimidazole analogue (343) showed potent
inhibitory activities with ic50 values of 9.6 ± 1.0 and 13 ± 1.5 nm,
respectively [202].

144

s. aggarwal et al. / steroids 75 (2010) 109–153

sawada et al. synthesized a novel series of indolizinebutyric
acids with various benzoyl substituents.fk687 (344) (s)-4-[1-[4[[1-(4-isobutylphenyl) butyl] oxy] benzoyl] indolizin -3-yl] butyric
acid displayed strongest in vitro inhibitory activity (ic50 = 4.6 nm)
against the human enzyme and in vivo inhibitory activity
(ic50 = 1.7 nm) against the castrated young rat model among the
series [203].

in 2002, various n-substituted 4 -biphenyl-4-carboxylic acids
were synthesized by increasing the conformational ﬂexibility using
an ether linker between the steroidal a–c-ring mimetics and were
tested against human and rat 5␣-reductase type i and type ii. two
compounds were found to be most potent with compound 345
showing an ic50 value of 60 nm while 346 showed an ic50 value
improved by a factor of 5 from 1.9 to 0.38 ␮m in comparison with
the parent biphenyl  xxxd1993xxx  [204].

baston et al. synthesized several 3,4-dihydro-naphthalene-2carboxylic acids and evaluated them for 5␣-reductase inhibitory
activity. the most active inhibitors were 6-[3-(n,n-dicyclohexyl
aminocarbonyl) phenyl]-3,4-dihydro-naphthalene-2-carboxylic
acid (348) (ic50 = 0.75 ␮m, human type ii; ic50 = 0.81 ␮m, human
type i) and 6-[4-(n,n-diisopropylamino-carbonyl) phenyl]
naphthalene-2-carboxylic acid (349) (ic50 = 0.2 ␮m, human
type ii). the latter compound was shown to deactivate the enzyme
in an uncompetitive manner (ki = 90 nm; km , t = 0.8–1.0 ␮m)
similar to the steroidal inhibitor epristeride (163) [205].

novel substituted benzoyl benzoic acids and phenylacetic acids
were synthesized by salem et al. based on the template structure
338 and were evaluated for the inhibition of rat and human steroid
5␣-reductase isozymes i and ii. the phenylacetic acid derivatives
were more potent than the analogous benzoic acids. bromination in
the 4-position of the phenoxy moiety led to the strongest inhibitor
of the series against human 5␣-reductase ii (352; ic50 = 5 nm),
which was equipotent to finasteride (13) while compounds 350
(ic50 = 23 nm) and 351 (ic50 = 27 nm) were also found to potent
inhibitors against 5␣-reductase type ii [206].

s. aggarwal et al. / steroids 75 (2010) 109–153

145

compound 358, having 2-hexyloctylamino group, was found to
be most potent inhibitor among the compounds with ic50 being
0.60 nm against human and 5.8 nm against rat 5␣-reductase [207].
a novel series of indole-3-alkanoic acids with varied n-benzyl
substituents were also synthesized. amongst these 4-[1-(6,6dimethyl- xxxd1943xxx  [b,d] pyran-3-yl) methyl indol-3-yl]-butyric
acid (359; fr119680) displayed very high inhibitory activity against
rat prostatic 5␣-reductase (ic50 = 5.0 nm) [208].

kato and coworkers synthesized a series of pyrrole butyric acid
derivatives and evaluated them for inhibitory activity on human
and rat steroid 5␣-reductase. in case of para-aminobenzoyl pyrrole
derivatives (353–356), the introduction of ethyl (354) or isopropyl
(355) at c-4 increased the activity [ic50 being 32 and 9.2, respectively], whereas the replacement with carboxyl (356) resulted
in compounds with decreased inhibitory activity against human
5␣-reductase enzyme, indicating steric restriction in the binding
site of the enzyme. compound with m-amino benzyl pyrrole (357)
moiety was found to be more active than the corresponding para
isomer (355) [ic50 = 3.2 nm].

33. bisubstrate inhibitors

igarashi et al. found a novel series of phenoxybenzoic acids
derivatives as potent inhibitors of human prostatic 5␣-reductase.
it was found that introduction of a chloro (360), ﬂuoro (361) or
methoxy (362) group at 3-position of benzene ring (r1 ) leads to formation of compounds with high inhibitory activity with ic50 being
0.87, 0.67 and 0.56 nm, respectively [209].

a series of indoline and aniline derivatives have also been
synthesized so as to inhibit both human and rat prostatic
5␣-reductase. among the indoline series, 3-chloro-4-{[1-(4phenoxybenzyl)indolin-5-yl]oxy} xxxd306xxx  (363; ym-36117)
was found to be the most potent inhibitor against human enzyme
having an ic50 value of 5.3 and 46 nm against the rat enzyme while
in aniline series, 3-chloro-4-{4-[n-(4-phenoxybenzyl)amino] phenoxy} xxxd306xxx  (364) turned out to be most potent inhibitor
with an ic50 against human and rat enzyme as 10 and 5.5 nm,
respectively [210].

ishibashi et al. synthesized a series of novel benzofuran derivatives with both carboxy and 5- or 6-diphenylmethylcarbamoyl
groups and their inhibitory activities against rat and human testosterone 5␣-reductase were tested in vitro. the derivatives were more
active against human type i enzyme than against type ii enzyme.
the 6-carbamoyl derivative such as 365 tended to be more potent
than the 5-carbamoyl ones such as 366 with 365 being the most
potent compound having ic50 value of 37.9, 50 and 340 nm against
rat, human type i and human type ii isozymes [211].

later, they also synthesized a series of 2-phenylbenzofuran
derivatives with a carbamoyl, alkylamino, or alkyloxy group at
the 5 or 6 position of the benzofuran ring. it was found that
carbamoyl derivatives had more potent inhibitory activities than
the alkylamino or alkyloxy derivatives against the rat enzyme and
the 6-carbamoyl derivatives tended to be more potent than the
5-carbamoyl ones. the 6-carbamoyl and 6-alkylamino derivatives
were found to be more potent inhibitors against human type i
enzyme than type ii but on whole compounds were found not to
be selective [212]. the non-steroidal o-hydroxyaniline (261; ono3805) was a weak compound in vitro versus human 5␣-reductase
ii. it is a bi-substrate inhibitor in which the butanoic acid moiety
is thought to be localized in the region of the phosphate group of
nadph and the lipophilic part could be orientated in the region
of the steroidal c and d-ring, thus occupying the hydrophobic
pocket of the enzyme. the fact that this compound acts as noncompetitive inhibitor (versus t) and not as uncompetitive one,
supports this hypothesis [173,213,214]. this prompted pﬁzer to
prepare the derivatives of 261 and subsequently c-3 acylindole
(367) was prepared which had improved potency versus both
human 5␣-reductase enzymes. the benzodioxolane (368) adopts
a similar minimum conformation to the ether (367) and proved
to be a potent dual inhibitor of both 5␣-reductase enzymes.
in common with the steroidal carboxylic acid inhibitors, these
compounds require the carboxylic acid moiety for potency and
the 3-acylindole motif was found to be crucial for dual activity
presumably by allowing access to both the conformations 369
and 370. the corresponding 2-methyl analog 371 which adopts
conformation 370 due to the presence of methyl group on the

indole ring was found to be a selective inhibitor of 5␣-reductase
i (table 37) [215]. fk-143 (372) 4-[3-[3-[bis (4-isobutylphenyl)
methyl amino] benzoyl]-lh-indol-l-yl] butyric acid was disclosed
by sawada et al. as a potent dual inhibitor of both human 5␣reductase isozymes. it inhibited in vitro human and rat prostatic
5␣-reductase in a dose-dependent manner with an ic50 of 1.9
and 4.2 nm, respectively, in a non-competitive fashion while in
vivo showed potent inhibitory activity against castrated young rat
model. this compound can be a potential drug for the treatment of
benign prostatic hyperplasia [216–218].

34. miscellaneous non-steroidal inhibitors
in search of novel non-steroidal mimics of steroidal inhibitors
of 5␣-reductase, 4-(2-phenylethyl)cyclohex-1-ene carboxylic acids
were synthesized with different substituents in para position of
the phenyl ring such as n,n-diisopropylcarbamoyl (373), phenyl,

148

s. aggarwal et al. / steroids 75 (2010) 109–153

phenoxy, etc. they turned out to be good inhibitors of the human
prostatic 5␣-reductase isozyme ii with 373 being the most potent
one (ic50 = 760 nm) [219].

fan et al. evaluated a series of umbelliferone (7hydroxycoumarin) derivatives as inhibitors of 5␣-reductase i on
lncap cells. the coumarin skeleton was considered as a mimetic of
the proposed transition state of the natural substrate and as well
as bioisostere of quinolin-2-one 1 ,1 -dimethylallyloxycoumarin
(374) showed potent inhibitory activity (ic50 = 1.3 ␮m) for the
5␣-reductase i. this was possibly a result of conformational effects
of geminal dimethyl group. 8-allyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (375) also
exhibited potent inhibitory activity (ic50 = 0.99 ␮m) against 5␣reductase i enzyme. introduction of a carbonyl group  xxxd2274xxx -position
(376) resulted in only a slight increase in 5␣-reductase i inhibitory
activity (ic50 = 0.49 ␮m) [220].

due to the excellent  xxxg730xxx  binding afﬁnity of a
series of 2 ,6 -disubstituted 4-hydroxy-4 -hydroxymethyl biphenyl
derivatives lesuisse et al. designed various biphenyls as surrogates
of the steroidal backbone. they hypothesized that by introducing
appropriate substituents non-steroidal estrogens could be tailored into 5␣-reductase inhibitors. two compounds (377 and 378)
emerged as potent type ii 5␣-reductase inhibitors with ic50 being
71 and 9.8 nm, respectively [221].

chen et al. evaluated isoﬂavonoids as potential non-steroidal
inhibitors of rat 5␣-reductase by using the hypothetical pharmacophore of 5␣-reductase. they proposed that although these
compounds (379–382) were inhibitors of rat 5␣-reductase in the

range of 27–49 ␮m they could be evaluated as human 5␣-reductase
inhibitors [222].

s. aggarwal et al. / steroids 75 (2010) 109–153

hasoda et al. in 2007 designed and synthesized novel type
i 5␣-reductase inhibitors by using 3,3-diphenylpentane skeleton
as a substitute for the usual steroid skeleton. 4-(3-(4-(nmethylacetamido) phenyl) pentan-3-yl) phenyldibenzylcarbamate
(383) was found to be a competitive 5␣-reductase type i inhibitor
with the ic50 value of 0.84 ␮m among the series [223].

35. conclusion and future ahead
finasteride (13) and dutasteride (27) are the only two steroidal
clinically used drugs that have evolved from nearly 40 years of
research on steroids as 5␣-reductase inhibitors but many compounds have shown promising results such as epristeride (163)
which is in clinical trials. combination therapy of 5␣-reductase
inhibitors with various ␣-blockers like terazosin, alfuzosin and doxazosin has been highly successful in the management of benign
prostatic hyperplasia and combinations of 5␣-reductase inhibitors
with anti-inﬂammatory agents have been tried successfully and it
is expected that this trend will continue. but the most challenging
work will be the puriﬁcation of 5␣-reductase, for which all efforts
have failed so far because of the unstable nature of the enzyme
during puriﬁcation, leading to a loss of activity. ligand-based comparative pharmacophore development using the known potent
inhibitors could provide an insight into the structural requirements
for the possible inhibitors of 5␣-reductase [224]. data obtained
by such techniques could be used for developing more potent
and selective inhibitors that can be manufactured by pharmaceutical industries at a lower cost. meanwhile, various classes of
non-steroidal inhibitors have also emerged. it would be encouraging to see if any of these molecules such as fk-143 (372) will be
available for clinical use. meanwhile, synthesis of steroidal and nonsteroidal derivatives will continue in search of a more potent and
less toxic inhibitor of 5␣-reductase. the basic research described
in this review article will assist in this process.
