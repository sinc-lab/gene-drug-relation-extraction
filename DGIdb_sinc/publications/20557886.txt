background: an increasing body of evidence suggests that testosterone may exert beneﬁcial effects against
the development of atherosclerosis. these effects are thought to be the consequence of its conversion
into estradiol and the activation of the estrogen receptors; however a direct role of androgens, such as
dihydrotestosterone, has also been proposed. more recently, it has been shown that the transformation of
the dihydrotestosterone to 5␣-androstane-3␣,17␤-diol (3␣-diol) and 5␣-androstane-3␤,17␤-diol (3␤adiol), generates two molecules unable to bind the  xxxg183xxx , but with a high afﬁnity for the
estrogen receptors (ers) in particular the ␤ isoform. as the actions of testosterone may result from the
balance between androgenic and estrogenic molecules originating from its catabolism, we investigated
the effects of the 3␤-adiol on inﬂammatory responses in vitro in human endothelial cells and ex vivo in
mice aortas.
methods and results: 3␤-adiol reverts the pro-inﬂammatory gene expression pattern induced by tnf-␣
in huvecs as determined by a cdna microrray approach. q-real-time pcr and protein array approaches
conﬁrmed that tnf-␣-induced icam-1,  xxxg2406xxx  and  xxxg2048xxx  as well as  xxxg357xxx  and il-6 induction was
affected upon 3␤-adiol pre-incubation.  xxxd2165xxx , an  xxxg730xxx  antagonist and r,r-thc, an
 xxxg730xxx  ␤ antagonist, counteracted the effect of 3␤-adiol while  xxxd334xxx , an androgen
receptor antagonist, had minor effects. 3␤-adiol exerted a similar action on macrophages. finally in
castrated male mice, 3␤-adiol signiﬁcantly counteracted the lps mediated mrna induction of il-6, elam1and  xxxg1724xxx  in the aortas.
conclusion: 3␤-adiol reverts in vitro the tnf-␣ and lps induced pro-inﬂammatory activation of endothelial cells and macrophages. 3␤-adiol in vivo modulates the inﬂammatory response induced by lps in the
arterial vascular wall.

1. introduction
androgens are believed to adversely affect the vascular bed
however the effects of testosterone at physiologic concentrations
remain unclear, as both vasodilatory and vasoconstrictive actions
have been reported [1,2]. an increasing body of evidence suggests
that testosterone may protect from the development of atherosclerosis in animal models [1]. the mechanisms involved however have

not been elucidated. it was suggested that testosterone may exert
its effects after conversion into 17␤ estradiol and activation of the
estrogen receptors (er) [3], however protective effects of the androgen pathway activation have been reported [4].
the expression in the endothelium of a series of adhesion molecules, such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1
(icam-1), vascular adhesion molecule-1 ( xxxg2406xxx ), plateletendothelial adhesion molecule-1 ( xxxg1724xxx ),  xxxg2048xxx  [5,6] and
of chemokines and chemotactic factors, such as il-6 or monocyte
chemoattracting protein ( xxxg357xxx ) represents the hallmark of the
atherogenic process which in turn promote the recruitment, adhesion and transmigration of circulating leukocytes in the intima, thus
sustaining atherogenesis [5].
both the  xxxg183xxx  (ar) and er are expressed in
endothelial cells and have been reported to modulate a num-

ber of endothelial responses [7,8]; the main androgen derivative
5␣-dihydrotestosterone (dht), indeed, inhibits the endothelial
pro-inﬂammatory activation mediated by  xxxg2296xxx 
alpha [7] by modulating the  xxxg1559xxx -dependent pro-inﬂammatory
activation. these data point to a key role for ar in endothelial protection; endothelial cells however, express the 3-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase enzymes which catalyze the conversion of dht to
5␣-androstane-3␤,17␤-diol (3␤-adiol), a molecule unable to bind
the  xxxg183xxx , but with a high afﬁnity for the estrogen
receptors, mainly er␤ [9,10]. it is therefore conceivable that part of
the testosterone-mediated atheroprotective effects, could depend
on er activation mediated by the testosterone/dht 3␤-derivative,
3␤-adiol. in the present study we investigated the possible effects
of 3␤-adiol in vitro on endothelial cell and macrophages gene proinﬂammatory responses and in vivo on mice aortas gene expression
patterns.
2. materials and methods
2.1. cell culture
huvecs were isolated as described [11] and cultured under
standard conditions in medium m-199 containing 20% fcs (fetal
calf serum), heparin (15 u/ml) and ecgf (endothelial cell growth
factor, 20 ␮g/ml) (roche, italy), the original donors of the cells gave
their signed consent to participate to the research, the investigation
conformed the principles outlined in the declaration of helsinki
and was approved by the local ethic committee. the cells were used
within the 4th passage. cells were plated in 6-well plates and used
after 48 h as sub-conﬂuent cultures. in all experiments, cells were
pre-incubated with medium containing 0.1% of fcs for 18 h. cells
were incubated in serum free medium, in the presence or absence
of compounds with appropriate chemicals or vehicle additions.
the monocytic cell line u937 was cultured in rpmi-1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fcs containing 2 mmol/l
l-glutamine, 100 ui/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin. for the
experiments u937 cells were differentiated into macrophages following incubation with pma 20 nm for 4 days.
2.2. in vitro studies, experimental set-up
preliminary experiments using 3␤-adiol from 1 nm to 1 ␮m
showed that the maximal effect is reached  xxxd1891xxx  nm, in agreement
with previous observation in other cell systems [12,13] and no further increase in the response is observed with higher concentration,
therefore the latter was chosen for all the subsequent experiments.
huvecs or u937 derived macrophages were then incubated with
either 3␤-adiol (10 nm), genistein (50 ␮m), 17␤-estradiol (10 nm)
or vehicle for 1 h followed by incubation with tnf-␣ (10 ng/ml)
or lps (5 ␮g/ml) for 4 h (mrna expression studies) or 6 h (protein expression studies). the concentrations of tnf and lps are
those commonly used to investigate the inﬂammatory response in
vitro. in the experiments investigating the inhibition of the estrogen receptors or the  xxxg183xxx ,  xxxd2165xxx  (100 nm), the
selective er␤ inhibitor r,r-tetrahydrochrysene (r,r-thc) (1 ␮m),
 xxxd334xxx  (10 nm) or vehicle were added 1 h prior the incubation with 3␤-adiol. control cells were incubated with the same
amount of vehicle that was added with the stimuli.

used for single-stranded cdna synthesis. biotins 11- xxxd1148xxx  and 11cctp cdna were synthesized according to the protocol from the
manufacturer and hybridized to the microarrays. after washing
and pre-blocking the slides were treated with anti biotin conjugate gold followed by silverquant detection mix (eppendorf, italy).
the images were acquired with the silverquant detection software
and analyzed with the silverquant analysis software (eppendorf,
italy). the cdna microarray experiments were performed according to the miame guidelines and data were normalized for the
housekeeping gene expression and internal-standard levels and are
presented as the percentage of variation vs. tnf-␣ incubation.
2.4. real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
total rna was extracted and reverse transcribed as described in
ref. [15]. three microlitre of cdna was ampliﬁed by real-time quantitative pcr with 1× syber green universal pcr mastermix (biorad).
the speciﬁcity of the syber green ﬂuorescence was tested by plotting ﬂuorescence as a function of temperature to generate a melting
curve of the amplicon. the melting peaks of the amplicons were as
expected (not shown). the primers used, the amplicon size and the
melting temperature have been published elsewhere [7,15]. each
sample was analyzed in duplicate using the iqtm -cycler (biorad).
2.4.1. immunoblotting
the analysis of icam-1 or cox-2 expression was performed
as described in ref. [11]. brieﬂy, the cells were lysed using a
tris–glycine buffer (0.25 m tris, 0.173 m glycine) containing 3% sds
and 1 mm pmsf (phenylmethylsulfonil ﬂuoride). aliquots of the
samples (15 ␮g) were diluted in a 2% ␤- xxxd26xxx  buffer
containing glycerol and bromophenol blue and electrophoresed on
a 10% sds-page, then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane
using a trans blot cell (hoefer scientiﬁc instrument, san francisco,
ca) [15,16]. the membrane was saturated at room temperature in
pbs containing 3% bsa for 1 h, washed with pbs-t (pbs containing
0.1% tween 20), then incubated overnight at 4 ◦ c with the primary
monoclonal antibody speciﬁc for icam-1 (bd biosciences, ca, usa)
or cox-2 (cayman chemicals, mi, usa) and anti-␤-actin antibody
(1:10,000, sigma). as second antibody anti-mouse igg peroxidaseconjugate (sigma) was used followed by ecl and autoradiography;
the bands were quantiﬁed by a computer-assisted system for image
analysis (isf image 1.52).
2.5. detection of cytokine release
for the detection of the cytokines in the supernatant a commercial protein array system (raybio human cytokine antibody array
c series 1000, ga, usa) was used according to the manufacturer
instructions. brieﬂy after the incubation with the blocking buffer for
1 h, the membranes were incubated with the medium supernatants
overnight at 4 ◦ c, then washed, incubated with the speciﬁc biotin
conjugated antibody mix followed by hrp-conjugated streptavidin.
the membranes were visualized by ecl and autoradiography. the
dots were quantiﬁed by a computer-assisted system for image analysis (quantityone); normalized intensities were calculated from
each array by ﬁrst subtracting the local background from each spot
and then normalized by the average intensity of the arrays. the data
were then corrected for the cell protein content of each well.
2.6. in vivo studies

2.3. cdna microarray
total rna was extracted as described in ref. [14] (rnaeasy
kit, qiagen) and analyzed using the dualchip® human inﬂammation microarray cdna silverquant® kit (eppendorf, italy) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. brieﬂy, 5 ␮g of total rna was

all the experiments were performed according to the guide
for the care and use of laboratory animals published by the us
national institutes of health (nih publication no. 85–23, revised
1996) and were approved by the local ethical committee. the study
was performed in 16 adult male 2-month-old c57/bl6j mice (four

animals each group). animals were housed in a controlled environment on an illumination schedule of 12 h light/dark and fed
with chow diet. mice were castrated 2 weeks before the experiment, a period known to be enough to reduce plasma androgen
levels to almost undetectable values [17]. 3␤-adiol (dissolved in
vegetable oil) was administrated at a dose of 10 ␮g/g of body weight
(s.c. ﬁnal volume 60 ␮l), followed 5 h later by lps (in saline solution) at a dose of 2.5 ␮g/g body weight (i.p. ﬁnal volume 100 ␮l)
for 18 h. controls were injected with the same volume of vehicle.
the animals were sacriﬁced according to the protocol of the internal ethics committee; after rapid perfusion with saline, the aortas
were isolated and placed in a storing solution (rna later, ambion)
at −80 ◦ c. for rna isolation, the samples were homogenized with
a dismembrator (braun) and then processed as described ref. [15].

2.7. statistical analysis
data are expressed as mean ± sd or ±se and are the result of at
least four separate experiments. statistical analysis was performed
using spss 16.0 for windows (chicago, il, usa) with kruskal–wallis
test for non-parametric multiple comparisons.

3. results
3.1. effects of 3ˇ-adiol on the inﬂammatory gene and protein
expression patterns induced by tnf-˛ in endothelial cells
first we investigated the ability of 3␤-adiol to modulate the
inﬂammatory response in huvecs. the tnf-␣ induced expression
of a wide range of pro-inﬂammatory genes as detected by cdna
microarray analysis is depicted in fig. 1 and supplementary data,
fig. i; the stimulatory effect of tnf-␣ on these genes was partially
inhibited when cells were pre-incubated with 3␤-adiol (10 nm)
(fig. 1); indeed the induction of adhesion molecules, cytokines,
chemokines, metalloproteinases, as well as key genes involved in
the cellular signalling pathways observed upon tnf-␣ incubation
was inhibited by incubation with 3␤-adiol (fig. 1).
q-pcr analysis conﬁrmed that the tnf-␣ induced expression
of icam-1,  xxxg2406xxx ,  xxxg2048xxx ,  xxxg357xxx , tnf-␣, il-6, cox-2 genes is
signiﬁcantly reduced upon pre-incubation with 3␤-adiol (fig. 2).
 xxxd79xxx   xxxd1710xxx ␤-adiol can be retro converted to dht, thus activating the
androgenic pathway, to further address the involvement of either
the androgen (ar) or the estrogen receptors (er) on the 3␤-adiol
mediated-effects, cells were pre-incubated with either bicalu-

ﬁve separate experiments are shown (data are corrected for the expression of the housekeeping gene rlp13a and are expressed in relation to tnf-␣ induction, mean ± sd)
(*p < 0.05 vs. tnf-␣, # p < 0.05 vs. tnf-␣ + 3␤-adiol).

tamide, a pure ar antagonist or  xxxd2165xxx  a pure er antagonist.
the inhibitory effects of 3␤-adiol were not affected by  xxxd334xxx 
with the exception of  xxxg2048xxx  while the inhibition of er receptors
signiﬁcantly reverted the effect of 3␤-adiol on the mrna expression proﬁle (fig. 2). of note the incubation of 3␤-adiol alone has no
signiﬁcant effects (fig. 2), similarly  xxxd2165xxx  or  xxxd334xxx  did
not show any signiﬁcant effects (data not shown). we next compared the effects of 3␤-adiol with that of 17␤-estradiol or of a
selective er␤ agonist such as genistein. while genistein (50 ␮m)
mimicked the effects of 3␤-adiol, 17␤-estradiol (10 nm) failed to
counteract tnf-␣ induced expression of adhesion molecules such
as icam-1,  xxxg2406xxx  and  xxxg2048xxx  but also that of il-6 and  xxxg357xxx 
(fig. 3). these data are in line with previous reports which indicates a differential er␤ activation by selected er ligands [10]. to
further investigate whether 3␤-adiol effects on endothelial cells
could depend on the activation of er␤ as reported for prostate
cancer cells [10] cells were pre-incubated in the presence of a speciﬁc er␤ antagonist such as r,r-thc (1 ␮m) followed by 3␤-adiol
and later tnf-␣. antagonism of er␤ halted the anti-inﬂammatory
effects of 3␤-adiol (fig. 3).
these data suggest that 3␤-adiol might reduce proinﬂammatory activation induced by tnf-␣ following er␤
activation. we conﬁrmed this observation at the protein level,
by investigating the proteome of supernatants from huvecs
incubated with tnf-␣ in the presence or in absence of 3␤-adiol,
 xxxd334xxx , or  xxxd2165xxx  using a human cytokine antibody
array (supplementary data, figs. ii and iii). in agreement with
previous ﬁndings, pre-incubation with 3␤-adiol reduced the
secretion of a series of adhesion molecules, cytokines, chemokines,
metalloproteinases as well as other molecules involved in the
inﬂammatory response induced by tnf-␣ (supplementary data,
fig. iii). furthermore, the inhibition of er receptors blocked the
3␤-adiol effects (fig. 3); in agreement with the mrna ﬁndings. as
soluble icam-1 levels were decreased in the presence of 3␤-adiol,
we investigated whether also cellular icam-1 expression was
affected. western blot analysis showed that pre-incubation with
3␤-adiol inhibited cellular icam-1 protein expression (fig. 4); thus
conﬁrming the effect of 3␤-adiol in reverting tnf-␣-mediated
inﬂammatory response at the mrna and protein levels.
3.2. effects of 3ˇ-adiol on the inﬂammatory gene and protein
expression patterns induced in human macrophages
since, a series of genes involved in the endothelium–leucocytes
interactions are affected by 3␤-adiol, we investigated whether 3␤adiol could also affect macrophages. preliminary experiments with
lps and tnf-␣, showed that lps was more effective in inducing the
inﬂammatory response in these cells (data not shown) and lps was
used in subsequent experiments.

icam-1 expression from four separate experiments is shown (data are expressed in
relation to tnf-␣ induction, mean ± sd) (*p < 0.05 vs. tnf-␣).

pre-incubation with 3␤-adiol signiﬁcantly counteracted the lps
induced mrna expression of il-6, tnf-␣, cox-2,  xxxg357xxx , cd40,
cx3cr1, pai-1,  xxxg1440xxx , resistin and ptx3 (fig. 5); while no effect
was observed on  xxxg390xxx , tlr4 and adamts1 mrna expression
(data not shown).
finally, the effect on cox-2 expression was conﬁrmed at the protein level. western blot analysis showed that 3␤-adiol decreased
the induction of cox-2 observed upon lps incubation (fig. 6). the
effect of 3␤-adiol was blocked by the er receptors antagonist
although also  xxxd334xxx  partially reverted the 3␤-adiol effect
(fig. 6).
3.3. effects of 3ˇ-adiol on the inﬂammatory gene expression
patterns in the aortas of c57/bl6 mice
to assess the potential effects of 3␤-adiol in vivo, we injected
subcutaneously 3␤-adiol in castrated mice, followed 5 h later by
intraperitoneally injection of lps (2.5 ␮g/g body weight). after
18 h mice were sacriﬁced and the aortas were processed for gene
expression studies. lps induced the expression of several adhesion
molecules, cytokines and chemokines (fig. 7). pre-treatment with
3␤-adiol decreased the expression of  xxxg2048xxx ,  xxxg1724xxx  and il-6

the expression of the housekeeping gene rlp13a and are expressed in relation to lps induction, mean ± sd) (*p < 0.05 vs. tnf-␣).

evaluated by western blot from four separate experiments (data are expressed in
relation to lps induction, mean ± sd) (*p < 0.05 vs. lps, # p < 0.05 vs. lps + 3␤-adiol).

(fig. 7) while icam-1,  xxxg2406xxx ,  xxxg357xxx  and ptx3 expression was not
affected. of note, the treatment with 3␤-adiol alone was ineffective. these data suggest that 3␤-adiol modulates the lps-induced
inﬂammatory response in the vascular wall in vivo.
4. discussion
the role of testosterone in cardiovascular disease is largely
debated. although male gender is regarded as a classical risk factor
for coronary artery disease, and androgens or the lack of estrogens
have been proposed as the cause of this male disadvantage. several
evidences suggest that low testosterone plasma levels, which are
observed in elderly, are associated with metabolic syndrome, type
2 diabetes and carotid intima-media thickness in men [18,19]. in
agreement low testosterone levels predict incident stroke and tran-

105

sient ischemic attack in older men [20], thus suggesting a protective
role for testosterone in cardiovascular disease [21,22]. despite this
observation, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects
are unclear.
it was initially suggested that testosterone may exert its effects
after conversion into estradiol and activation of ers [3]. it was also
suggested that the effects that could not be blocked by the inhibition of the aromatase depend on the activation of the androgen
pathway. indeed we and others reported that dht, a molecule that
cannot be aromatized to 17␤-estradiol, inhibits the endothelial proinﬂammatory activation mediated by  xxxg2296xxx  alpha
[5,23].
we now extend these ﬁndings showing that a not aromatable dht metabolite, the 5␣-androstane-3␤,17␤-diol (3␤-adiol),
decreases tnf-␣ and lps induced inﬂammatory response in vitro
and in vivo. of note, 3␤-adiol has an high afﬁnity for er␤ isoform [9] thus suggesting that testosterone metabolites, other than
those generated through aromatization, could exert a series of biological effects which are mediated by the er activation. indeed
3␤-adiol has been shown to be responsible for dht induced stimulation of arginin vasopressin [12] and for the reduction of coronary
hyperreactivity [13]. in line with this evidence we demonstrate
that 3␤-adiol decreases the inﬂammatory gene expression patterns induced by tnf-␣ in endothelial cells, including that of
pro-inﬂammatory mediators such as chemokines, cytokines and
their receptors as well as adhesion molecules. of note a series of
genes whose expression is down regulated by tnf-␣ return to basal
levels in the presence of 3␤-adiol, thus suggesting a global mechanism directed at counteracting endothelial inﬂammatory response.
furthermore, the response mediated by 3␤-adiol was maximally
inhibited by er blockage with a pure antiestrogen, while ar blockage, was less effective. furthermore the selective inhibition of er␤
almost abolished 3␤-adiol effects, pointing out a key role for the
axis 3␤-adiol-er␤ activation in the control of tnf-␣ mediatedeffects. of note 3␤-adiol effects were also mimicked by genistein;
the latter however could exert additional er␤-unrelated responses
which should be considered. furthermore  xxxd79xxx   xxxd1710xxx ␤-adiol could be converted back to dht the possibility that part of the effects observed
are dependent on ar activation could not be excluded.
the effect of 3␤-adiol is conﬁrmed also at the protein level and
indeed 3␤-adiol inhibited tnf-␣-mediated release of a series of
adhesion molecules, cytokines, chemokines, metalloproteinases as
well as other molecules involved in the inﬂammatory response
induced by tnf-␣. this effect is not restricted to endothelial
cells  xxxd79xxx   xxxd1710xxx ␤-adiol modulates the inﬂammatory response also in
macrophages, thus suggesting an effect of 3␤-adiol that goes

beyond the endothelium. to extend this observation, we investigated ex vivo the effect of 3␤-adiol administration on lps mediated
pro-inﬂammatory response in the arterial wall of mice. the analysis, performed in castrated animals to avoid any confounding
effect of physiological testosterone-derivatives, showed that subcutaneous injection of 3␤-adiol signiﬁcantly reduces lps mediated
mrna induction of adhesion molecules such as  xxxg2048xxx  and
 xxxg1724xxx  as well as of cytokines such as il-6. a trend was observed
also for other adhesion molecules such as icam-1 and  xxxg2406xxx .
this represents the ﬁrst observation of an in vivo effect of 3␤-adiol
on vascular inﬂammation and is strengthened by the mouse model
used, which lacks any physiological testosterone-derivatives and
therefore allows to assess the effect of exogenous 3␤-adiol, clearly
indicating a key role for 3␤-adiol in vivo in agreement with mishra
et al. [13] which showed an effect of 3␤-adiol in reducing coronary hyperactivity. our ﬁndings may contribute to explain some
of the beneﬁcial effects reported for dht and, as the conversion
between dht and 3␤-adiol occurs almost ubiquitously, it is reasonable to propose that these events may represent a mechanism
inducing a concomitant activation of the ar and the er response in
contrast with that due to estrogen derivatives which promote only
er responses.
of interest, 17␤ estradiol was totally ineffective on the same
parameters modiﬁed by 3␤-adiol, suggesting the existence of
different ligand-selective pathways of er␤. the possibility that
3␤-adiol and 17␤-estradiol differentially activate er␤ signalling
in endothelial cells is in agreement with data in pc cells [10] and
suggest that 3␤-adiol could act as an endogenous selective er modulator (serm). future studies are needed to unravel the molecular
mechanism underlying this differential signalling and to investigate whether sustained 3␤-adiol administration could affect the
progression of chronic vascular disease such as atherosclerosis.
in summary, we have shown that 3␤-adiol, reverts the proinﬂammatory activation of endothelial cells and macrophages by
tnf-␣ and lps and in vivo modulates the inﬂammatory and proatherosclerotic response observed in the arterial vascular wall. as
part of the effects of 3␤-adiol depends on the back-conversion to
dht, this suggests the possibility that a concomitant activation of
both ar and er mediated responses could be useful in controlling
the vascular inﬂammatory response observed during atherosclerosis.
