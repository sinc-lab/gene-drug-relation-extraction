abstract
selenocysteine se-conjugates (e.g. methylselenocysteine) have been shown to be potent
chemopreventive and chemoprotective agents, and inducers of apoptosis. although the
mechanism of action remains to be elucidated, b-elimination of these compounds by b-lyase
enzymes into corresponding selenols, pyruvate and ammonia is thought to be critical. this
study describes in vitro b-lyase activity in nine rat organs using three selenocysteine
se-conjugates and s-(2-chloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethyl)-l-cysteine. for all substrates the highest
b-elimination rates were found in kidney, followed by liver, while brain, spleen, heart, large
and small intestine, thyroid and lung were of minor importance. since liver plays an
important role in b-elimination, hepatic b-lyase activity was extensively studied using 23
selenocysteine se-conjugates and s-(2-chloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethyl)-l-cysteine and was compared with previously obtained renal b-lyase data. the results showed that hepatic b-lyase
activities were 4–25-fold lower than the corresponding renal b-lyase activities. hepatic
b-elimination of the substrates appeared to be exclusively catalyzed by the pyridoxal
5%-phosphate-dependent b-lyase enzyme  xxxg1296xxx . studies performed with human hepatic cytosols of three individuals showed that hepatic b-lyase activity was 2 – 5-fold higher

when compared with the previously obtained human renal activity. significant correlation
was obtained between human hepatic b-lyase activities of three individuals. the relevance of
this data for using secys-conjugates as chemopreventive and a chemoprotective agent is
discussed. based on the large differences in organ-selective b-elimination and specific b-lyase
activity between rat and humans, the rat might not be a good model to investigate
nephrotoxicity of cysteine s-conjugates, and chemoprevention and chemoprotection of
secys-conjugates in man. © 2002 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
in animal feeding studies se-methyl-d, xxxd3186xxx , se-(n-propyl)-d, xxxd3186xxx  and se-allyl-d, xxxd3186xxx  have been shown to be relatively potent
chemopreventive agents [1– 3]. in vitro studies with these agents have also demonstrated that these selenocysteine se-conjugates (secys-conjugates; rsech2ch(nh2)cooh) can inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis [4–6]. another
potential therapeutic application is chemoprotection against toxic side effects of
drugs, as has been observed for other organoselenium compounds [7,8] and was
recently also shown for secys-conjugates in combination with cisplatin [9]. as a
mechanism of action, bioactivation of secys conjugates by b-elimination, resulting
in the formation of selenols (rseh), ammonia and pyruvate, has been proposed
[1,2,10]. compounds that are able to generate selenols are expected to possess good
anticarcinogenic activities [2]. secys-conjugates are good substrates for rat and
human renal cytosolic b-lyase enzymes, including the pyridoxal 5%-phosphate (plp)dependent cysteine conjugate b-lyase/ xxxg1294xxx  (gtk) [10–12].
based on the selective nephrotoxicity that is observed upon administration of
several cysteine s-conjugates, sulfur analogs of secys-conjugates, of halogenated
alkenes to rodents, it has been postulated that secys-conjugates may be kidney-selective prodrugs [10]. the basis of this organ selectivity might be the combination
of active uptake of secys-conjugates and a relatively high b-lyase activity in the
kidney, as previously shown for cysteine s-conjugates [13]. this kidney selectivity
was also observed by elfarra et al. for the cysteine s-conjugates of 6- xxxd2573xxx  and 6- xxxd3352xxx  [14,15]. after dosing rats with these cysteine s-conjugates,
much higher concentrations of the corresponding antitumor thiols were observed in
kidney than in liver and plasma.
recently, two other enzymes have been shown to catalyze b-elimination reactions
of secys-conjugates [16,17]. it was demonstrated that another cytosolic enzyme,
amino acid oxidases, can also catalyze direct b-elimination of secys conjugates,
thereby generating selenols, pyruvate and ammonia [17]. preliminary studies have
shown that b-elimination of some secys-conjugates occurred to a considerable
extent in rat hepatic cytosol when compared with rat renal cytosol [2]. additionally,
we observed recently that se-benzyl- xxxd3186xxx  was a substrate for rat hepatic
cytosolic b-lyase(s) [16]. additionally, it was demonstrated that flavin-containing
monooxygenases (fmo) are able to catalyze b-elimination of secys-conjugates by

245

oxidation of the selenium atom followed by a facile syn-elimination, resulting in the
formation of selenenic acids (rseoh), but not selenols, pyruvate and ammonia
[16]. although at least three enzyme systems appear to contribute to b-elimination
reactions of secys conjugates, only two enzyme systems directly generate selenols.
for the use of secys-conjugates as kidney-selective chemoprotective agents, a local
drug release and mechanism of action is preferable, while for using secys-conjugates as chemopreventive agents a non-organ-selective bioactivation is beneficial.
in the present study, we studied b-elimination of secys-conjugates in homogenates and cytosols of nine rat organs in vitro. fmo catalyzed b-elimination
was not studied, because it is not involved in the formation of selenols directly but
in the formation of selenenic acids [16]. since the highest specific b-elimination
activity, in addition to the kidney, appeared to be present in liver tissue and because
the b-lyase activity per organ appeared to be highest for the liver, we determined
kinetic parameters for b-lyase activity towards a large series of secys-conjugates in
rat hepatic cytosol. furthermore, using chromatographic fractionation of rat
hepatic cytosol we investigated whether multiple enzymes are involved in b-elimination reactions of secys-conjugates. finally, b-elimination activity screening was
also performed using human hepatic cytosol from three individuals and these
activities were compared with those obtained with human renal cytosol [12].

2. materials and methods

2.1. materials
a-keto-g-methiol-butyric acid (kmb), l-kynurenine, p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid
and horseradish peroxidase type i from horseradish (116 u/mg) were purchased
from sigma chemical co (st. louis, mo, usa). o-phenylenediamine was obtained
from janssen chimica (geel, belgium).  xxxd439xxx  ( xxxd439xxx ,  xxxd439xxx ) was obtained from aldrich chemie (brussels, belgium).  xxxd2298xxx  was from j.t. baker (deventer, the
netherlands). se-methyl- xxxd3186xxx  (1) was kindly donated by eburon organics n.v. (rijkevorsel, belgium). other secys-conjugates were prepared by andreadou et al. [10] and rooseboom et al. [12]. s-(2-chloro-1,1,2trifluorethyl)-l-cysteine (ctfe-cys) (24) was synthesized as described by commandeur et al. [18]. all other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially
available.

2.2. animals
male wistar rats (200– 250 g) were obtained from harlan (zeist, the netherlands) and were fed a standard laboratory diet from hope farms (woerden, the
netherlands) and had access to food and water ad libitum. rats (n= 4) were
sacrificed by decapitation and the following organs were isolated: brain, heart,
kidney, large intestine, liver, lung, spleen, small intestine, and thyroid. the organs

246

m. rooseboom et al. / chemico-biological interactions 140 (2002) 243–264

were homogenized in two volumes of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4)
with 0.9%  xxxd3213xxx  using a potter– elvehjem homogenizer at 4 °c and were
used for the experiments with organ homogenates. to obtain the cytosolic fraction
the homogenate fraction was centrifuged for 20 min at 12000× g, and the obtained
supernatant was centrifuged for 60 min at 100000× g. all tissue fractions were
dialyzed against a 20-fold excess of potassium phosphate buffer (20 mm, ph 7.4)
to remove endogenous pyruvate and cofactors in order to minimize background of
pyruvate and to prevent further metabolism of pyruvate, respectively. protein
concentrations were determined with the biorad protein kit (hercules, ca, usa).
to scale the specific b-lyase activity of secys-conjugates and ctfe-cys to
b-lyase activity per organ, specific b-lyase activities in rat tissue homogenates,
expressed as nmol/min per mg of protein, were multiplied by the total amount of
protein per organ. these values were calculated from the protein concentration of
the tissue homogenate multiplied by the volume of the tissue homogenate that was
obtained for each organ. based on these calculations the amount of protein per
organ (mg per organ) was: 43.2 (brain), 39.1 (heart), 32.8 (kidney), 37.6 (large
intestine), 737.8 (liver), 24.7 (lung), 52.3 (small intestine), 27.5 (spleen) and 29.7
(thyroid).

2.3. human tissues
livers obtained form three dutch men, deceased at the age of 50 (designated
liver i), 66 (designated liver ii) and 65 (designated liver iii), were isolated within 8
h after death at the pathology department, academic hospital vrije universiteit,
amsterdam, the netherlands. dialyzed hepatic cytosols, prepared as described
above for rat organ fractions, were stored at − 80 °c until use. protein contents of
dialyzed cytosols were determined with the biorad protein kit (hercules, ca,
usa).

2.4. organ-selecti6e i-elimination of secys-conjugates and ctfe-cys
substrates were incubated for 20 min at 37 °c at a final concentration of 1.4
mm, containing 0.5 mm kmb and 1 mg of protein per ml dialyzed homogenate or
cytosol in 50 mm sodium borate buffer (ph 8.6). due to the high b-elimination
activity obtained in rat renal fractions a final protein concentration of 0.5 mg of
protein per ml was used, instead of 1 mg of protein per ml, and an incubation time
of 5 min instead of 20 min was used. the total incubation volume was 100 ml.
incubations were terminated by the addition of 500 ml 0.14% o-phenylenediamine in
3 n hcl and heated for 60 min at 60 °c to derivatize pyruvate to the fluorescent
quinoxalinol. the incubation vials were centrifuged for 15 min at 4000× g, and the
amount of derivatized pyruvate was analyzed by hplc with fluorescence detection
(ex 336 nm, em. 420 nm), as described previously [12]. the experiments were
performed in triplicate and non-enzymatic degradation of conjugates was not
observed, as previously reported for experiments with renal cytosols [12].

2.5. i-elimination of secys-conjugates and ctfe-cys by dialyzed rat and human
hepatic cytosols
initially, the time course of the b-elimination in rat and human hepatic cytosol was
determined to assess linearity. 1.4 mm secys-conjugate or ctfe-cys, 0.5 mm kmb
(cofactor) and 1 mg of protein per ml dialyzed rat hepatic cytosol or 8 mg of protein
per ml dialyzed human hepatic cytosol dissolved in a 50 mm sodium borate buffer
(ph 8.6) was incubated in a total volume of 1 ml at 37 °c. b-elimination rates were
linear over this concentration range (1– 8 mg/ml). at several time points 100 ml
samples were mixed with 500 ml of 0.14% o-phenylenediamine in 3 n hcl and, in
order to complete the derivatization, heated for 60 min at 60 °c. the incubation vials
were centrifuged for 15 min (4000×g) and the amount of pyruvate was analyzed
as described above.
since pyruvate formation started to deviate from linearity at 20 min, specific b-lyase
activities in hepatic cytosols were determined by incubating substrates (1.4 mm) with
dialyzed rat hepatic cytosol (1 mg of protein per ml) or human hepatic cytosol (8
mg of protein per ml) in the presence of 0.5 mm kmb and 50 mm sodium borate
buffer (ph 8.6) for 20 min at 37 °c. reactions were terminated by the addition of
500 ml 0.14% o-phenylenediamine in 3 n hcl and heated for 60 min at 60 °c. the
incubation vials were centrifuged for 15 min at 4000× g, and the amount of pyruvate
was analyzed as described above. enzyme kinetic parameters (km and vmax) of the
conjugates were determined by incubating substrates at seven concentrations ranging
from 0.14 to 1.4 mm. the substrates were incubated in the presence of 0.5 mm kmb
and 1 mg/ml dialyzed rat hepatic cytosol in 50 mm sodium borate buffer (ph 8.6)
for 0 and 20 min at 37 °c in a total volume of 100 ml. subsequently, the incubations
were stopped by the addition of 500 ml 0.14% o-phenylenediamine in 3 n hcl and
heated for 60 min at 60 °c. incubation vials were centrifuged for 15 min at 4000× g,
and the amount of pyruvate was analyzed as described above. the experiments were
performed in triplicate and non-enzymatic degradation of conjugates was not
observed, as previously reported for experiments with renal cytosols [12].

2.6. fractionation of rat hepatic cytosol by anion exchange fast protein liquid
chromatography (fplc)
rat hepatic cytosol was fractionated by fplc using a mono q anion exchange
column (pharmacia biotech, uppsala, sweden), as described by commandeur et al.
[11]. thirty fractions of 2 ml were collected and analyzed directly for enzyme activity.
all incubations described below were performed in triplicate.
activity profiles of b-elimination reactions were determined by incubating fractions
with four secys-conjugates (2, 5, 6 and 19) and ctfe-cys (24). to determine
b-elimination activity, 20 ml fplc-fraction was incubated at 37 °c in the presence
of 1 mm conjugate, 0.5 mm kmb in 50 mm sodium borate buffer (ph 8.6) in a
total volume of 70 ml. after 20 min 250 ml 0.14% o-phenylenediamine in 3 n hcl
was added. samples were heated for 60 min at 60 °c, and pyruvate was analyzed
as described above.

248

m. rooseboom et al. / chemico-biological interactions 140 (2002) 243–264

to investigate the role of plp-dependent b-lyases, such as  xxxg1296xxx  and
gtk, and the role of plp-independent b-lyases, such as amino acid oxidase,
incubations were also performed in presence of  xxxd439xxx  and in absence of kmb.
l-amino acid oxidase is known to be unaffected by  xxxd439xxx  [19] and  xxxd439xxx  did not
chemically react with pyruvate. in this case the fractions were pre-incubated at
37 °c with 1 mm  xxxd439xxx  in 50 mm sodium borate buffer (ph 8.6) for 3 min after
which the substrate was added as described above.
to investigate the contribution of rat hepatic cytosolic amino acid oxidases to the
metabolism of secys-conjugates, fractions were also screened for oxidative deamination towards secys-conjugates. samples (200 ml) containing 0.94 mm p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 5.7 mg horseradish peroxidase, 1 mm conjugate, and 20 ml
fplc-fraction in 50 mm sodium borate buffer (ph 8.6) were incubated at 37 °c.
after 20 min 20 ml 0.3 m znso4 was added to terminate the reaction and the
samples were placed on ice. samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 4000× g and
the amount of  xxxd2298xxx  was measured: 80 ml incubation sample was
added to a quartz cuvette and diluted with 720 ml 100 mm potassium phosphate
buffer (ph 7.4). the fluorescence was detected at an excitation wavelength of 323
nm and an emission wavelength of 400 nm. the reaction is based on the oxidation
of p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid to the fluorescent product 2,2%-dihydroxybiphenyl5,5%-diacetate by horseradish peroxidase and  xxxd2298xxx  [20].
 xxxg1296xxx  activity was determined in the fractions using a modified method
of shetty and gaertner [21] based on the conversion of l-kynurenine to anthranilic
acid and alanine. samples containing 1 mm l-kynurenine, 10 mm plp and 500 ml
fplc-fraction in 50 mm sodium borate buffer (ph 8.6) were incubated for 20 min
at 37 °c. incubation vials were placed on ice and the fluorescence was determined
at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm and an emission wavelength of 400 nm
( xxxd189xxx ).
elution of aspartate aminotransferase was monitored spectrophotometrically
using a kit of sigma (st. louis, mo, usa) based on coupling oxaloacetate
formation to nadh oxidation with  xxxg1739xxx . 10 ml of fplc fraction
was used in the standard assay.

2.7. inhibition studies
inhibition of  xxxg1296xxx  activity was determined as follows: incubation mixtures (1 ml), containing 0.25 mm l-kynurenine (used as the substrate), 10 mm plp,
0.5 mm kmb, 1 mg of protein per ml rat hepatic cytosol and a concentration
range of the inhibitors se-phenyl- xxxd3186xxx  (6) or ctfe-cys (24) in 50 mm
sodium borate buffer, were incubated for 20 min at 37 °c. subsequently, incubation vials were placed on ice and the fluorescence was determined at an excitation
wavelength of 350 nm and an emission wavelength of 400 nm ( xxxd189xxx ).
inhibition of b-lyase activity was determined by incubating 0.25 mm se-phenyll-selenocysteine (6) or ctfe-cys (24), used as substrates, 0.5 mm kmb, 1 mg of
protein per ml dialyzed rat hepatic cytosol and a concentration range of the
inhibitor l-kynurenine in 50 mm sodium borate buffer for 20 min at 37 °c.

249

reactions (100 ml) were terminated by adding 500 ml 0.14% o-phenylenediamine in
3 n hcl and were heated for 60 min at 60 °c. the incubation vials were
centrifuged for 15 min at 4000×g, and the amount of pyruvate was analyzed as
described above. all experiments were performed in triplicate.
3. results

3.1. organ-selecti6e i-elimination
b-elimination of secys-conjugates tested, belonging to three structural classes,
was observed in all nine organ fractions of the rat (fig. 1). for all nine organs the
specific b-lyase activity was higher in the cytosolic fractions than in whole tissue
homogenates (fig. 1a and b). for all secys-conjugates tested the highest specific
b-lyase activity was present in the renal fractions. in general a decrease in specific
activity was observed in the order kidney liver\ brain: spleen\ heart: large
intestine\thyroid :lung : small intestine (fig. 1a and b, compounds 3, 7 and
19). a similar tissue distribution was observed for ctfe-cys (24), a well-known
nephrotoxic cysteine s-conjugate [13,22]. also for ctfe-cys (24) the b-lyase
activity was much higher in the renal fraction than in the other organs (fig. 1a and
b). considering the total amount of protein present in the organs, the b-lyase
activity was calculated per organ. as demonstrated in fig. 1c, the highest total
b-lyase activity was present in the liver for all secys-conjugates (compounds 3, 7
and 19) and ctfe-cys (24). the b-lyase activity per organ was 2.1–3.6-fold lower
in kidney than in liver depending on the substrate used. for the other seven organs
only a very low activity when compared with the liver and kidney was observed.
b-lyase activity calculated per organ based on the b-lyase activity data in tissue
homogenates and b-lyase activity data in tissue cytosols gave the same results,
suggesting that cytosolic enzymes play a major role in the b-elimination of the
conjugates studied.

3.2. substrate selecti6ity and kinetics of i-elimination reactions in dialyzed rat
hepatic cytosol
since the total b-lyase activity per organ appeared to be the highest for the liver
the characteristics of b-elimination of 23 secys-conjugates by rat hepatic cytosol
was investigated in more detail. b-elimination with all 23 secys-conjugates and
ctfe-cys (24) was linear up to 20 min in rat hepatic cytosol (data not shown). for
this reason all specific activities as well as the enzyme kinetic parameters, km, vmax
and specificity constants (vmax/km), were determined using 20 min incubation times
(tables 1 and 2 and fig. 2). not for all compounds saturation was achieved within
the concentration range studied (0.14– 1.40 mm) (table 2). due to the low
solubility of some of the secys-conjugates the apparent enzyme kinetic parameters,
km and vmax, could not be determined accurately. in these cases the respective
specificity constants (vmax/km) were calculated from the slopes in the lineweaver–
burke plots (fig. 2).

250

m. rooseboom et al. / chemico-biological interactions 140 (2002) 243–264

the rat hepatic cytosolic b-lyase activity appeared to be stereoselective, because
the available d-isomers of compounds 12 and 20 were not metabolized by b-elimination at all (table 1). ctfe-cys (24), a good b-lyase substrate, had a specific
activity and a specificity constant (vmax/km) in rat hepatic cytosol that was in the

b-lyase activity in tissue homogenates (a), b-lyase activity in tissue cytosol (b) and calculated b-lyase
activity per organ (c). experiments and scaling were performed as described in section 2. results are
presented as mean value 9 s.d. for three preparations.

same order of magnitude than those for the secys-conjugates, indicating that
secys-conjugates are also good substrates for hepatic b-lyase enzymes (tables 1
and 2; fig. 2). alkyl-substituted secys-conjugates (compounds 1 –4) displayed a
steric effect; an increase in alkyl chain length resulted in a decrease in hepatic
b-lyase activity (table 1). furthermore, substitution of se-phenyl- xxxd3186xxx 
(compounds 6 –14) resulted in a decrease in specific hepatic b-lyase activity, while
substitution of se-benzyl- xxxd3186xxx  (compounds 15–23) increased the b-elimination activity.

3.3. fractionation of rat hepatic cytosol by anion exchange chromatography
rat hepatic cytosol was fractionated using mono-q anion exchange fplc.
b-elimination of ctfe-cys (24) was observed in fraction 10 and to a lesser extent
in fractions 9, 11 and 12 (fig. 3a). the presence of  xxxd439xxx , a potent inhibitor of
plp-dependent b-lyases, pyruvate formation was completely abolished. all secysconjugates had almost identical activity profiles also with a maximal activity in
fraction 10, as shown for se-ethyl- xxxd3186xxx  (2), se-allyl- xxxd3186xxx  (5),
se-phenyl- xxxd3186xxx  (6) and se-(p-methylbenzyl)- xxxd3186xxx  (19), substrates belonging to three structural classes (fig. 3b–e). for all secys-conjugates
pyruvate formation was completely inhibited by  xxxd439xxx , indicating a full dependence on plp-dependent enzymes. in accordance with this, formation of hydrogen
peroxide could not be detected in the fractions, indicating that l-amino acid
oxidase does not play a role in the metabolism of secys-conjugates in rat hepatic
cytosol in contrast to the kidney [17].

substrates were incubated in a concentration range of 0.14–1.40 mm in presence of 0.5 mm kmb

the hepatic enzyme  xxxg1296xxx  is known to catalyze b-elimination reactions
[25]. the activity profile of  xxxg1296xxx  was indeed identical with the activity
profiles of secys-conjugates and ctfe-cys (fig. 3f).  xxxg1296xxx  activity was
inhibited by se-phenyl- xxxd3186xxx  (6) and to a higher extent by ctfe-cys

(24) as shown in fig. 4a. conversely, pyruvate formation from these two substrates
could be inhibited by l-kynurenine (fig. 4b and c). aspartate aminotransferase
from rat brain and kidney was proposed by kato et al. as an alternative b-lyase
enzyme [23]. however, aspartate aminotransferase activity was only present in
fraction 8 (data not shown). due to the fact that fraction 8 did not contribute to
pyruvate formation, rat hepatic aspartate aminotransferase is not involved in the
b-elimination of the conjugates tested.

3.4. i-elimination reactions in human hepatic cytosols of three indi6iduals
all seven tested conjugates were metabolized by b-elimination by all three human
hepatic cytosols, although the specific b-lyase activity was up to 3-fold lower for
human liver ii than for human livers i and iii (table 3). as shown in fig. 5a–c,
significant correlation was obtained between the b-lyase activities of three human
hepatic cytosols, indicating similar substrate specificity. for the conjugates the rank
order of the specific b-lyase activity in all three human hepatic cytosols was:
se-phenyl- xxxd3186xxx 
(6):se-(p-chlorophenyl)- xxxd3186xxx 
(13)\
ctfe-cys (24)\ se-(p-methylbenzyl)- xxxd3186xxx  (19)\ se-allyl- xxxd3186xxx  (5): se-benzyl- xxxd3186xxx  (15)\ se-methyl- xxxd3186xxx  (1) (table
3). a correlation between the specific b-lyase activity in rat hepatic cytosol and
human hepatic cytosols was not observed.

4. discussion
although the mechanism of action of secys-conjugates is still unclear, bioactivation by b-lyase enzymes resulting in the formation of biologically active selenols is
considered critical [1,2,10]. since preliminary studies have shown that b-elimination
of secys-conjugates is not exclusively catalyzed by renal enzymes, we investigated
in the present study the tissue distribution of cytosolic b-elimination activity of
these prodrugs [2,16]. knowledge about the organ-selective b-elimination is needed
to delineate the therapeutic applications of secys-conjugates. for antitumor or
chemoprotective applications of prodrugs, a local activation and mode of action is
preferable, thereby preventing toxicity in non-tumoral tissues and preventing a
reduction of the therapeutic effect, respectively. for chemopreventive prodrugs a
local activation is not necessary, because the aim is a general protection. when a
drug can be transported through the body, a local prodrug activation is allowed
and the prodrug activating organ thereby functions as an in vivo drug source.

the present study shows that b-elimination of secys-conjugates occurred in nine
different tested rat tissue fractions in vitro. however, the specific b-lyase activity in
kidney was much higher than in liver, brain, heart, large and small intestine, lung,
spleen and thyroid. this was also observed by comparing the present data with
previously obtained data on b-elimination of secys-conjugates in rat renal cytosol
as shown in table 1, obtained under similar conditions [12]. the kidney/liver ratio
varied from 4 for se-(p-chlorophenyl)- xxxd3186xxx  (13) to 25 for se-benzyl-lselenocysteine (15), with an average ratio of nine. the specificity constants (vmax/

cytosol than in rat hepatic cytosol (fig. 2). using ctfe-cys (24), a known
nephrotoxic compound due to bioactivation by b-elimination [13], as a substrate a
similar tissue selectivity was observed with a kidney/liver ratio of six (table 1). in

the present study, the b-lyase activity in the different tissues was also calculated per
organ. it appeared that the highest b-lyase activity was present in the liver for both
secys-conjugates and ctfe-cys as substrates. based on the present results,
hepatic b-elimination of secys-conjugates and ctfe-cys appeared to be exclusively catalyzed by the enzyme  xxxg1296xxx  ( xxxg1296xxx ) [24–26]. in addition to
the liver, the kidney also displayed considerable b-lyase activity compared with the
liver, while the other organs were of minor importance. the present results show
that the average rat hepatic b-lyase activity towards alkyl-substituted secys-conjugates was lower than towards phenyl- and benzyl-substituted secys-conjugates. in

260

analogy with this, tateishi et al. reported that aromatic cysteine s-conjugates were
better substrates for rat hepatic b-lyase than aliphatic cysteine s-conjugates [24,27].
furthermore, b-elimination of d-isomers of secys-conjugates by rat hepatic cytosol was not observed in the present study, as observed with d-isomers of secysconjugates in rat and human renal cytosol [10,12] and with various d-isomers of
cysteine s-conjugates previously [27].
the present results demonstrate that b-lyase activity in rat hepatic cytosol is
5–32-fold higher than in human hepatic cytosol of three individuals depending on
the individual and the substrate used. furthermore, no significant correlation was
observed between the b-lyase activities in rat and human hepatic cytosol. in
analogy, tomisawa et al. reported that human hepatic cytosolic b-lyase activity is
about one-tenth of the rat hepatic cytosolic b-lyase activity using s-(p-bromophenyl)-l-cysteine as a substrate [28]. our results show that se-phenyl- xxxd3186xxx  (6) was a better substrate for human hepatic cytosolic b-lyase(s) than the
alkyl-substituted secys-conjugates tested (1 and 5). tomisawa et al., who purified
human hepatic cytosolic b-lyase by 880-fold, reported also that s-phenyl-l-cysteine
was metabolized by b-elimination at a higher rate than various s-alkyl-l-cysteines
[28]. therefore, the structure activity relationship of secys-conjugates appears to be
consistent with that of cysteine s-conjugates, however, the responsible enzymes for
the bioactivation of secys-conjugates in human liver cytosol remains to be
characterized.
the present human hepatic b-lyase data can be compared with our previously
obtained b-lyase data of secys-conjugates in human renal cytosols, obtained under
the same conditions [12]. in contrast to the rat, in humans the b-lyase activity was
on average 2– 5-fold higher in hepatic cytosol than in renal cytosol. furthermore,
no significant correlation was observed between the b-lyase activities in human

hepatic cytosol and human renal cytosol (p =0.231; r 2 = 0.33; n =6). for ctfecys, b-lyase activity was also higher in human hepatic cytosols of three individuals
than in human renal cytosols of three individuals (2–8-fold), while in rats the
kidney/liver ratio was six, which correlates to a ratio of five previously reported for
this substrate [29].
these results raise the question whether the rat is still a good model to study the
chemopreventive properties of secys-conjugates and the toxicity of cysteine s-conjugates of halogenated alkenes in man. in relation to this it is interesting to note
that b6c3f(1) mice exposed to tetrafluoroethylene (tfe), for which it has been
shown that b-lyase mediated activation of the cysteine s-conjugate of tetrafluoroethylene (tfe-cys) causes toxicity, developed liver neoplasms, while exposure of tetrafluoroethylene to rats resulted in nephrotoxicity [13,30]. this might be
due to a difference in balance between renal and hepatic b-lyase activity in mice and
rats. the study of hong et al. implicates that cysteine s-conjugates of halogenated
alkenes that do not cause hepatotoxicity to rats might be hepatotoxic to mice and
possibly humans [30]. whether the mouse is a better model than the rat to study the
toxicity of halogenated alkenes and the chemopreventive effects of secys-conjugates in humans, needs to be delineated.
in the present study b-elimination of secys-conjugates was observed in all nine
tested rat organs. whether the b-lyase activity in the organs with low activity would
be sufficient to generate a steady stream of selenols to be effective against
carcinogens in all of these organs is at present unclear. another hypothetical
possibility is that the liver and kidney function as a source for selenols, which are
subsequently transported via the bloodstream to other organs. whether selenols can
be conjugated (i.e. methylation, sulfation, glucuronidation, or binding to plasma
proteins) and subsequently transported or can freely move through the body is at
present unclear and remains to be established. it has been shown that methylselenol
can be reversibly methylated to dimethylselenide and trimethylselenonium in rats
[31,32]. glucuronidation and sulfation of selenols has not been reported, although
this might be reasonable since selenols are nucleophilic agents. for selenenic acids,
released upon metabolism of secys-conjugates by fmos, which might also be
involved in the observed pharmacological effects, transport seems to be less likely
due to their high reactivity [16].
for the use of secys-conjugates as prodrugs of antitumor or chemoprotective
agents an organ-selective bioactivation is desirable. based on the present results, the
liver and kidney seem most suitable for such an approach. although the hepatic
b-lyase activity appears to be higher than renal activity, renal activation in vivo still
may be higher based on active uptake of secys-conjugates as demonstrated for
sulfur analogs [13]. this is illustrated by the fact that ctfe-cys, which has a lower
kidney/liver ratio in rats than the average ratio for the secys-conjugates, is known
to selectively cause nephrotoxicity in rats, while serum glutamate–pyruvate
transaminase (sgpt) levels, associated with hepatotoxicity, were unaffected [22].
the same applies for s-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine (dcvc). this compound,
with an in vitro kidney/liver ratio of 3.6, is known to cause a selective nephrotoxicity [13]. moreover, elfarra and hwang observed much higher concentrations of

262

m. rooseboom et al. / chemico-biological interactions 140 (2002) 243–264

the corresponding thiols in the kidney than in liver and plasma after dosing rats
with cysteine s-conjugates of  xxxd2573xxx  and mercaptoguanine [14,15]. to
further increase kidney selectivity of secys-conjugates, n-acetylation resulting in
the formation of a ‘double-prodrug’ might be an interesting option. it has been
shown by endo that the  xxxg59xxx  activity in the rat is 9.6-fold ( xxxg59xxx  i) and 9.1-fold
( xxxg59xxx  iii) higher in kidney than in liver [33]. in line with this commandeur et al.
[29] reported that deacetylation rates for n-acetyl-cysteine s-conjugates of halogenated alkenes were 7– 9-fold lower in rat hepatic cytosol than in rat renal cytosol.
moreover, n-acetylseleno- xxxd2595xxx  was shown to be deacetylated by  xxxg59xxx  i
[34]. therefore, n-acetylation of secys-conjugates is likely to increase the kidney
selectivity, since both deacetylation and b-elimination of the conjugates are then
needed to liberate selenols.
we conclude that secys-conjugates are mainly bioactivated in kidney and liver,
while the other seven investigated organs are of minor importance. secys-conjugates display a comparable tissue-selective b-elimination as ctfe-cys. in contrast
to the rat, the human hepatic b-lyase activity is higher than the human renal b-lyase
activity. furthermore, the b-lyase activity is lower in human liver than in rat liver.
therefore, the rat might not be a good model to investigate nephrotoxicity of
cysteine s-conjugates, and chemoprevention and chemoprotection of secys-conjugates in man.
