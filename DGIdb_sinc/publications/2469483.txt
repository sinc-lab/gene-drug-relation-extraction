aluminum is the most abundant metal in the earth's
cttist, oc~wring mainly as aluminosi]iuate& ill aqlteous
solutions aluminum interacts with water m o l e c o ~ and
hydroxt! ions to form various complexes. this p ~ e s s
of hydrolysis depends un many factc~s including pl-l.
ionic strength, and the concantration of aluminum itself. the effects of aluminum on biological systems have
been the topic of many investigations (for example~ see
refs. 1-3); the effects of ~lumlnum fluoride complexes
[4] will not be discussed). experimental zesults and
theoretical considerations have led inves~gators to hypothesize that, among all the pns~ble aluminum species
in solution, the trivalent free aluminum ton, ai 3+, is the
active form responsible for many of the observed
aluminum effects [4-6]. it was suggested that ai 3+ acts
by substimting for other b ~
active inns such as
m g 2 + and fe 3+ at esseutial functional sites[4,7]. direct
evidence for this hypothesis, however, has been obtained from only a few biological systems, probably

univ~ity

because many investigations have focused on descn'bing
the consequences, rather than defining the m~ecolar
basis, of the aluminum effects. "ltm~-dore for many of
these biological systems the ~
underlying the
observed aluminum effects are yet to be discovered.
a reoent study [8] has shown that, at p h 7, as litrle as
10 /zm aluminum reduced the voltage depeadence of
the mitochondrial channel,  xxxg2409xxx  [9]. in all eukaryode
cep~s examined thus far, these water-filled channels are
found in the mitochondsial ou~:r membrane [10-19]
and serve as the pathway through which metabofites
tra~
this m.~mbrane. like many other voltage-gated
channels,  xxxg2409xxx  is in its most permeable slate (olxm
state) at zero or low membrane potentials and assumes
one of several lew-condactaxtce states (closed s~tes) at
high{~r pote~tjnls [20]. the recent study [8] ip4rovided
coml~elling evidence that alminnum exhibits the voltage-dependent closure of  xxxg2409xxx  by making the r~hanm,i
unable to detect membrane potentials. based on the
exper~nental evidence, the authors concluded that
aluminum neutralizes the sensor (functional site ~ s p o ~ b l e for a channel's voltage dependence) of  xxxg2409xxx 
through either the neutral ai(oh)~ or the
ai(oh) 4 .
in the present study, various organic and metallic
ions were tested for alnmlntlm-like effects, and quanti.
tative analyses involving various metals were made in
order to g a ~ insights into the mechanism of this inbibi-

¢ b ~ g ~ , were recorde~ under voltageclamp conditions [16] on a kipp & zonen bd41 chart
recorder. the ope~ d ~ m e l carsent was first measuxed
by applying a low potential, usually - 1 0 mv (the sign
of the voltage refers to the cis side), and then the
voltage-dependence characteristics of these control

channels were tested by recording the rate of channel
closure at several .higher vo|la~s, usually by lo-mv
increments. an aliquot of a 10 mm stock solution of
one of the metals(chloride sa~t) was then added to both
sides, while stirring for 30 s. then, the same characterizasion procedure was repe~ted.
for both control and treated channels, the voltagedependunt current ¢lec~ase was followed until a clear
steady-state current wos reached and after each high
voltage pulse the membrane was returned to - - 1 0 mv
to assure that the observed current changes had not
been distorted by insertion or loss of channels. the
posslbifity of birding of the metal species by the buffer
ions was t ~ l , in selectedexperiments, by tripling the
ccmcantration of buffer in the beginning m middle of
the experiments; this possibility was essentially ruled
out because inereasing the buffer concentration did not
cause a detectable change in either the behavior of
untreated channels or the effectiveness of the metals.
after each ~ t ,
the ph and volume of both
solutions were carefully measured, and no ph change
greater than ±0.3 ph units occurred even with the
highest metal concentrations used. a [ ~,:erimcots were
conducted at room tempesamre..all trivalent metals, in
the form of highly purified ( > 99.9~) chloride salt or
hydroxide (indium), were purchased from either aldrich
clgmicui co. or aesar, johnson matthey inc. divalent
metals and organic acids were reagent grade.
data ana,'ys/s
the current decrease in response to ~m applied
potential is an exponential decay, and the time required
for the enmmt to decrease to l / e of the total current
change is defined as the time constant (~) of the channel-dosing process. tm~e constants were therefore used
to quantitate the change in channel voltage depoe~.etge
as a resuh of the presence of metals. the time constant
of each current decay crave corresponding to a particular voltage was determined with a hewlett-packard
digitizer operated by an hp-85 computer. the data
were log-traasformed and plotted in accordance with
the theoretical derivation in appendix a (f_.qn. a-7). in
agfeenu~t with the theory, the in ~r values, corresponding to a particular metal, its concentration, and the
medium ph, fell approximately into a straight line
when plotted against the applied voltage. the straight
line was drawn by linear r¢sressiun. then, the voltage
needed to achieve a in • = 2 (obtained from linear
regression) for each set of conditions (metal, its concenu'ation, ~mi ph) was determined and used as a
memure of the potency of a particular metal under the
experinumtal conditions. for a given metal and ph,
these voltage values, when corrected for control values
(datemdned prior to the addition of metals), increased
linearly with increasing metal concentrations; a quantitative description of the potency of a given metal at

70
8iveu ph could then be made (see appendix b for
theoretical derivations).

the mitochandrial channel,  xxxg2409xxx , when inse~ed
into planar phespho~id membrune~ is highly voltagedependent, being open at low membrane potentials and
closed at high potentials. when, however, micromolar
quantities of aluminum chloddc were added to the
buffered bathing solution the voltage dependence was
greatly reduced and could be virtually ~ m ~ . * t a d 181.
the inhibitory effect exerted on  xxxg2409xxx  by alumimma is
highly reproducible, and is probably also qaite specific,
as indicated by the observation that all other iota also
present in the bathing solutions (e-g., 1 m kci, 5 m m
caci~, and 10 m m buffer ions) did not interfere with
~h~nnel closure. the previous work also indicated that
the neutral and anionic hydroxylated olandnum sf ~cies
were pesm'bly responsible for the observed inhibition_
thus, in .searching for o t h ~ reagents which might
a ~imil~r e..ffe~ the present investigation has focused oa
organic anions and on metals that form hydroxylaled
complexes in aqucons solutions. the experiments were
performed at p h 7.0, room temperature, and on multichannd membranes gen~ated as desc~'bed in methods.
channels were first allowed to full~ ~
at a low
membrane potential, esoally - 10 my, and then a higher
voltage was appfied. the untreated channds w e ~ charact¢fized by measuring the time constants of channel
cl~-_re as a function of membrane potential. one of the
ions to be tested was then addi:d (while stirring) to
solutions o~a both sides of the membrane and the same
charaeterization procedure was repeated.
fig. 1 shows the effect of gallinm on the rates of the
voltage-dependant conductance changes in a multichannel membrane. after the addition of 40 p m of
geninm chloride, higher voltages were needed in order
to achieve similar closure rates. using these types of
experiments, three group i l i a metals (aluminum, gallium, and indium) were found to strongly inhibit (at ph
7) v d a c s voltage.4kpendent closure. in all cases, the
time needed to achieve a steady-state closed-channel
condu~tan~ at a 8iveu appiied voltage was ~rcatly
increased whereas t.he same ext¢.nt of closure euu]d still
be reachad when a high enough vintage was applied.
in contrast to these group i l i a metals, at concentrations ranging from 1 m to 10 m m the organic anions
tested showed no detectable effect on the voltage-dependent closure of  xxxg2409xxx . similarly, all divalent metals
tested also failed to inhibit the channel closnl~ at concentrations up to 500 p m (5 m m in the case of zinc; ~ee
table i). these observations indicate that orsanic anions do not inhibit  xxxg2409xxx 's voltage dependence and
that the aluminate anion seems unlikely to be the effetefive species.

similar to those presented in fig. 1 were performed at
ph 5 and ph 7 because, for all three metals, the
m(oh)3 concentration is quite diff~re~at at these two
ph values (fig. 2). the time constants of charnel
closure were determined as a fimcfion of membrane
potential and fitted to a straight line (see appendix or
theory). fig. 3 represents the results of typical experlments showing the inhibition of closure by the metals at
ph 5 (upper row) and ph 7 (lower row). this was done
both before and after addition of the metals (as metal
chloride salts). multiple additions of the metals were
often made and each was followed by the determination
of channel closure time constants. the inhi'bitory effect
of the metals on channel closure and the dependence of
this effect on metal concentration were demonstrated
by the shift of the data l ~ n m to higher voltage regions
in response to each metal addition. this shift indicates
that in the presence of increasing concentrations of the
n~tals the magnitude of the applied voltage required to
achieve a given time constant also increased. a comparison of fig. 2 and fig. 3 shows that, for all three
metals, the differen'fial effectiveness at the two ph
values was paralleled by the ph-depettdent change in
their m(oh)3 concentrations. for example, gallium was
much more effective at ph 5 while indium was more
effective at ph 7.
in order to incorporate the results into a theoretical
framework, the foliowing eq,.latinn has been developed

d~pite the strong evidence in favor of the candidacy
of metal trihydroxides, this form is the most insoluble.
lndeec~ "&e concentrations of m(oh)3 shown in table
ii for the effe~ve metals are well above those allowed
by the solubility products. the assumption of the existertce of supersaturation (see discussion) is supported
by experiments with chrominm. as shown in table iv,
at ph 6.6 the time constant of closure was increased by
the addition of 500 pm chromium chloride. at this ph,
the ct(oh)3 concentration is about 505 higher than
that allowed by the solubility product, yet very little
precipitation was observed; therefore the effective concemration of ckoh) 3 was suwgient to cause a marked
increase in time constant. however, when the ph was
raised to 6.9, precipitation increased rapidly as evideuced by the i ~
in turbidity. this change was
accompanied by a rapid, time-dependent decrease of
the cl,~sure time constant as expec~ted for a decreasing

dis~.ed0e
aluminum (aqueous ~ l ~ _ ~
of "..--~el~l.,~j-~,~t metal)
has been shown to ialtibit the voltage-dependent closure
of  xxxg2409xxx  at a concentration as low as 10 p m [8].
aluminum-treated channels exhibit two principal characterist~ changes ~ compared to normal channels: (i)
higher membrane potentials are needed in order to
achieve the same probability of being cloud; and (il)
the change of their membrane eucadactanc¢ as a function of membrane potential is less steep, le. less voltage-dependent. such inhibitory effects of aluminum axe
believed m be mediated through groups on the protein
that enable  xxxg2409xxx  to respond to the m~nnbmne potential. these groups form the ~nmor of the d~nn©l a
number of studies [25-27] have, shown that these groups
are very likely to be po~tlvely charged amine side
chains of the channel protein. there is evidence [8] that
aluminum acts by neutmlitin~ the sensor and thus
making it incapable of responding to the membrane
potential. it w ~ sossested that ti~ effgclive aluminum
species was either the neutral  xxxd131xxx 
(ai(oi-i)3), or mote likely, the anionic tetrahydroxoalundnate (ai(oh)~) because the latter could neutralize the gating charges by direct electrostatic in~racfions with the seusm. however, this suggestion is disfavored by the present results became none of the
anions tested reduced  xxxg2409xxx 's voltage dependence.

the "aluminum effect" is not umque to
other group ilia metals (ga~un~ indium) and a nuu~
bet of trivalent transition metals (scandium. i n ~ and
chromium) also exhibited the capab~ty to cause
inhibitiou~ a common characteristic of these metals is
their ability to form (wjalivdy) high levels o f metal
m~ydroxide under the test couditkms. quantitative
analysis has further demonstrated that the p h depeud~'~'~ of *_he eff~6v~n__.~s__ of ~ ~_~u_p i l i a metals
became in~gnificant when the amount of metal added
w-~ expressed as the concentration of m(oh) 3 present
in solution. ~ e n other hydrolysis species were considered, the results exhfoited no meaningful pattern. these
results provide strong evidence that m(oh)3, not
m(oh)~, is responstble for the obsen,ed inhibition and
t h e ~ o r e indicate a mechanicm other than simple dectmstatic neutralization.
in fig. 4, the rmul~ of the expedmenta p o ' f m u g d at
ph 5 and ph 7 are demonstrated by open and closed
symbols, respectively. data plotted versus [m(oh)3 ]
present in solution cxitibit essentially no dgpenden~ on
types of metal or on pll when the data were plotted
against other spe~es such dependence is marked, ln~dentally, it may be noteworthy that when th~ result5 are
corrected for the m~ydroxide, there seems to be a
small, ph-related separation of the data points (open
vs. closed symbols). this may imply that the observed
ph-dependence of the metal effcgts is caused in part by
factor(s) other_ than metal hy&olysls.
while the entire literdtu~ on eluminum to.x~.ty suggests that (of the hydrated species) al~+ is the active
form, the present data argue otherwise. not only do
these data indicate that ai(oh)3 is the active species
but they also provide evidenc~eagainst the candida~ of

75
ai3÷. this is demonstrated by tbe total lack of c¢~relatinn betwcen the effectiven~s of the mctals and the
~4u~nuation of the m 3÷ species in solution. f-j4phnations for the difference between the present fmdings
and ethers cueld be many. for ins~r~e, it could be due
to the fact that in most reported systems a p ~ is active
by i n t u a c g ~ with negaw,~y charged oxysen-danm
stoups [28] whereas the .~nsor of  xxxg2409xxx  is most ~ e j y
to be entoposed of poeitivdy charged an~no groups.
the unly exception to the above staten~mts e n n ~
ft~en the experiments with boron. boron did not inhibit
channel closure at ccmeentrations up to lo m m although its primary form at the experingntal ph is
b(oh)3 ( b o ~ acid). this ~
diffe~en~ between
boron and the rest of the m ' h y d ~ t e d
etemams may
be attn'bbted to boron's unique structural and, consequendy, chemical chara~m'isti~ because of its small

m . ~ more @=htly tl~m do odor gronp i l i a dements.
imtan binds the three hydroxyl groups via
strong covahmt bonds forming a planar structure that is
quite differuat from the octahec~a: swactore formed by
the other group i l i a dentents+ this could explain why
the observed metal-cbennd interactions do not oceur
between boron and  xxxg2409xxx .
the present results have s ~ 3 ~ thet @~e ability to
form metal trihy~oxide is a necessary prerequisite for a
metal to be inhibitory. as shown in table ii, this
comiition is satisfied by all the effective metals. in
contrast, lanthanum (hi) forms essentially no trihydroxi_de [24.29] and is, exv,e~_e~__y, i_neffecfive. on the
hand, c h a r a , . ~
such as ionic radius and
surface charge density seem to play no significant role
in this mattes. this may indicate that for a metal to be
effective, the m(oh)3-forming ability is not only necessary but also sufficienl
as part of the original plan, experiments aimed at
testing the metal effect under ~lk~lir~ com]fitioqs (e.g.,
at ph 9) were also performed. these attempts failed
because no inhibition could be detected with any of the
i l i a elements even though some of them had high
percentages of the m(oh) 3 form at ph 9. during the
repeated testing, it was found that the channel-metal
interaction was path-depcudenl for inslam~ inhibiikm could be observed at p h 9 only if it was first
obtained at lower p h values before the ph was adjusted
to 9. this path dependence is characteristic of processes
with kinetic limitations. at p h 9 the experimental system was probably far away from eqm~brinm. because
of the short-lived nature of the lipid bilaye~.
because the rebaths obtained at ph 5 and ph 7 were
already quite informative, the ph 9 experiments were
not pursued further.
when comparing the concentrations of the metal
speci~ calculated from stability constants with those

deduced front the solubility products of the corresponding m(oh)3, it was found that in mv~t of the
experimental situations the former exceeds the latter.
the fact that an i~creased inhibition with increasing
metal concentrations was consistently observed indientes that the concentration of the effective species was
indeed increasiug. also, after each metal addition a
plateau of the inhibitary effect was always observed
within 20-30 rain, indicating the establisbagnt of an
equilibrium. the b¢~¢ explanation for these phenomena
is that the solutions were supersaturated with respect to
cdj~.al]ine m(oh) 3 and that this condition allowed for
tie: existence of a metastable equilibrium among the
hydrolysis species [24,30].
the evidence of supersaturation comes from the experiments with crci 3 (table iv). unlike the other
metals tested, chromium tended to precipitate rather
than form supersaturated solutions. experiments and
calenlations have shown that the concentration of
cr(oh)3 was indeed limited by the solubility producl
at ph values where precipitation was pt-edicted the
bluish-grey cr(oh)3 precipitate was always clearly visible even with only 50 p m total crci 3 in solution. in
contrast, in the case of all other metals tested a prceipilate was never observed even at 500/.tm concentrations.
observations suggest that when there is a precipitatinn it should probably be easily visible and accompanied by the weakening of any already aslablished inhibitory effect. therefore the solutions of metals other than
chromium were probably always supersaturated. in fact,
with cfci 3 icmporary supersaturation could also
be obtained near the critical ph (about 6.6) only ~_f
adequate stirring was applied at the time of metal
addition. it is unclear why chromium behaved so differently from other metals even though its hydroxide is
much more soluble than those of other effective metals.
a previc~s report [8] has provided evidence that
aluminum neutralizes  xxxg2409xxx 's tensor, probably through
the sensor's constituent amino groups. the lone pair of
dectrons of the nitrogen in the neutral -]qh 2 group
could undergo a nucleophific attack on the metal and
complex with it by displacing the coordinating water.
this complexation would cause the equilibrium to move
towards the neutral form and therefo:e de~.tuase the
-nh~ concentration. i f a number of these amino groups
were located close together, they may act in a cooperative fashion to chelate the metal and reduce the charge
on the sensor. a multidentate sensor may indeed be
nce~sary because aluminum forms strong complexes
with polyamines [31] but interacts oniy weakly with
unidentate amine groups (much more weakly than with
oxygen-donor ligands [4]).
the necessity of a muhidentate sensor is also supported by the current findings, although the data do not
allow for the determination of a definite stoichiometry.
nevertheless, it seems reasonable to speculate that the

76
binding of metal trt~ydroxide to  xxxg2409xxx  may result in
the forrr~atinn of a neutral compk.x, ai(oh)3(-ni-i2r)3,
in which the -oh and onh 2 groups form an cctahedral
coordination around the metal. this would i:ot only
acco,mt for the loss of voltage dependence dee to the
reduction of the charge on ~ sensor, but it would also
explain why aluminum failed to affect the ion-selectivity
of  xxxg2409xxx  [8], although the anion-selective property of
 xxxg2409xxx  is also attrilmted to amino groups [27] the
relative location and orientation of these groups may
not allow for a stable complexation between ~ gronps
and the metal species. while reasonably descn'biog the
posdble mechanism of the metal- xxxg2409xxx  interaction
and explaining the electmphysiological results reported
previously [8], this hypothesis predicts that the ab~ w of
the sensor to inter, act with a metal should be ph-dependent. contrarily, the observed ph dependence of the
inhibition can he .accounted for. alone, by effects on the
hydration state of the metal in solutiml at present, this
issue ~ n u o t be. resolved. ho~.~,rer, experbr,ents have
shown that the chara~eristics of control channels did
not change with ph ~dthiu the range of 5-9 [26].
the aluminum effects das~'hed in this paper oceurred at extremely low levels of aluminum. at neutral
ph, a total "aluminum concentration as low as i / t m had
a significant effect. similar~,, the lowest total aluminum
concentration that inhibred the rot-brain bexokinase
has been determined to be about the same [1]. by
comparison, tens of micromolar concentrations of total
aluminum were needed to initiate microtubul¢ polymerization [33], and over 40 ~ m m inhibit mitochondrial
respiration [34]. much higher levels of total alumhaur~
had to be used to iner~c~e the perm~h~lity o f the
blood-brain barrier (1 mm [35 d or for al;nn~ xxxd323xxx  to
effectively compete with magnesium in supporting m/~
crotabule assembly (10 m m [33d. the~fore the
alaminum- xxxg2409xxx  interaction is among the most
alumlnum-sensitive under physiological conditions.
in conclusion, the present :tudy has provided strong
evidenc~ that aluminum and other n g t a h specifically
interact with  xxxg2409xxx  via their neutral hydrolysis species,
m(oh)3. this interaction appears to be highly dependent upon the concentration of the metal, and the
consequence is s decrease or loss of the channel's voltage dependence.. this finding ind/eates a different
mechanism for celi-aluminum interactions than that
suggested by others in the literature and should promote further investigations.

system which exists, at any time, in either o~e of the
