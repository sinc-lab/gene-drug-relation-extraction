amlodipine, a dihydropyridine derivative, has been shown to block not only l-type but also n-type ca2+
channels. aiming to understand the mechanism underlying such a selective blockade by amlodipine, the
interaction of amlodipine with n-type channels was investigated using the xenopus oocyte expression
system together with the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique and the binding assay for [3h]
amlodipine. when expressed as the alpha1balpha2/delta1beta1a combination, the n-type channel formed a high afﬁnity
binding site for [3h]amlodipine (kd, 3.08 nm) and was profoundly blocked by amlodipine (ic50, 2.7 mum at
− 60 mv). by contrast, r-type (alpha1ealpha2/delta1beta1a) channels did not possess a high afﬁnity binding site for [3h]
amlodipine and their channel activities were not inﬂuenced by amlodipine. in comparison of amino acid
sequences in the transmembrane regions iiis5, iiis6 and ivs6 of the  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunit, which are involved in
dihydropyridine binding in l-type channels, the two amino acid residues lys1287 (corresponding to met1295
in alpha1b) and phe1699 (corresponding to leu1697 in alpha1b) were unique in alpha1e. an amino acid substitution of
lys1287met in iiis5 of alpha1e conferred a high afﬁnity binding site for amlodipine (kd, 13.1 nm) and a
sensitivity to amlodipine (ic50, 11.3 mum). in n-type channel, reversely, an amino acid substitution of
met1295lys in iiis5 of alpha1b deprived a high afﬁnity binding site for amlodipine and reduced the channel
blockade by amlodipine (ic50, 29.6 mum). the results indicate that met1295 in the region iiis5 of alpha1b is critical
for amlodipine to efﬁciently bind and block the  xxxg303xxx .

1. introduction
high voltage-activated ca2+ channels in excitable cells such as
myocytes, smooth muscle cells and neurons play important roles
including contraction of myocytes, electrical excitement in neurons,
and modulation of hormone and neurotransmitter release (tsien et al.,
1991). high voltage-activated ca2+ channels are pharmacologically
classiﬁed into at least ﬁve different subclasses (l-, n-, p-, q- and r-type),
of which characteristics are considered to be determined by the poreforming  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunit. the alpha1c ( xxxg346xxx .2), alpha1d ( xxxg305xxx ) and alpha1s ( xxxg310xxx )
subunits form l-type ca2+ channels and dihydropyridines (dhps),
phenylalkylamines and benzothiazepines bind them with high afﬁnity,
whereas the alpha1b ( xxxg303xxx ), alpha1a ( xxxg302xxx ) and alpha1e (cav2.3) subunits form
n-, p/q- and r-type ca2+ channels, respectively, which show low
afﬁnities for these drugs (hering et al., 1998; hockerman et al., 1997;
striessnig et al., 1998). because nifedipine, the prototype of the dhps,
exclusively blocked muscular l-type ca2+ channels (fleckenstein, 1983),
dhps had been considered as selective blockers for l-type channels.

recent studies have shown, however, that some dhps such as
amlodipine (furukawa et al., 1997, 1999), cilnidipine (fujii et al.,
1997; furukawa et al., 1999; uneyama et al., 1997) and benidipine
(furukawa et al., 1999), blocked n- and p/q-type ca2+ channels as
well. by contrast, these dhp derivatives fail to block r-type channels
(furukawa et al., 1999). these ﬁndings indicate that dhps are no
longer considered as the speciﬁc blockers of l-type ca2+ channels.
dhps are widely used clinically in the treatment of hypertension,
angina pectoris and cerebrovascular diseases. however, the molecular
mechanism by which some dhps can preferentially block n- and p/qtype ca2+ channels remains unclear.
non-l-type ca2+ channels are diversely distributed in peripheral
and central nervous cells (tsien et al., 1991). however, native
neuronal cells and cell lines posses multiple subtypes of ca2+
channels in a single cell, which hampers quantitative comparison of
effects of a given drug on a single subtype of ca2+ channel. to address
these issues at the molecular level, a single alpha1b or alpha1e subclass of the
ca2+ channel and its mutant  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  with an amino acid substitution were
co-expressed with the same auxiliary  xxxg831xxx /delta and beta subunits in xenopus
oocytes, and then amlodipine was examined on its membrane binding
properties and current blocking effects. in the present study, met1295
in the transmembrane region iiis5 of the alpha1b subunit of n-type

channel had key roles in high afﬁnity binding of amlodipine and
channel blocking by amlodipine.
2. methods
2.1. pcr product preparation
all pcr reactions were performed in 50 mul reactions containing 1 u
kod dna polymerase (toyobo, tokyo, japan), 5 ng of plasmid and
1 pmol of each pcr primers for 30 cycles (94 °c 30 s, 55 °c 1 min,
72 °c 2 min). the chloramphenicol resistance gene from pgps2.1
(new england biolabs, beverly, ma) was ampliﬁed using the

r4s6-1/2, n3s5-1/2 and n4s6-1/2 were puriﬁed and resuspended in
water (1 mug/mul), respectively.
2.2. mutagenesis of alpha1e and alpha1b by using et-recombination
the plasmid pspb3s (furukawa et al., 1998) carrying the entire
protein-coding sequence of alpha1b (fujita et al., 1993) was partially
digested with hindiii, blunted with t4 dna polymerase, and
circularized with t4 dna ligase, to yield pspb3h1. the plasmids
pspbii carrying the entire protein-coding sequence of alpha1e (niidome
et al., 1992) and pspb3h1 were digested with hindiii, blunted, and
circularized to produce pspb2h1 and pspb3h2, respectively. in the
plasmids pspb2h1 and pspb3h2, hindiii sites on vector were deleted.
using escherichia coli strain jc8679 (gillen et al., 1981), electroporation-competent bacterial cells were prepared according to the
procedures described previously (angrand et al., 1999) and, then,
transformed with the plasmid pspb2h1 or pspb3h2 by electroporation using a gene pulser (bio-rad, hercules, ca) set at 2.5 kv, 200 omega
and 25 muf. again, electroporation-competent bacterial cells were
prepared from the transformed cells with each plasmid. jc8679
(deposit no. ht017) was obtained from health science research
resources bank (osaka, japan).
an amino acid substitution in alpha1e (lys1287met or phe1699leu)
and alpha1b (met1295lys or leu1697phe) was performed using rece and
rect mediated recombination (et recombination) (angrand et al.,

15

1999). brieﬂy, the electroporation-competent cells transformed with
pspb2h1 were thawed on ice, added by the pcr product pcrp-r1 or
pcrp-r2 (1 mug), and subjected to the electroporation. similarly, the
competent cells transformed with pspb3h2 were subjected to the
electroporation with the pcr product pcrp-n1 or pcrp-n2. these
transformed cells after the electroporation were suspended in
600 mul l-broth and incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °c before plating on lagar containing chloramphenicol (100 mug/ml), in order to identify
bacteria cells containing homologously recombined plasmids (pspb23scm1, pspb2-4scm1, pspb3-3scm1 and pspb3-4scm1) with the
pcr products pcrp-r1, pcr-r2, pcr-n1 and pcr-n2, respectively. to
remove the chloramphenicol resistance gene, the recombined
plasmids pspb2-3scm1/pspb3-3scm1 and pspb2-4scm1/pspb34scm1 were digested with bstz17i and hindiii, respectively, and
circularized to yield pspb2-3sh1, pspb3-3sh1, pspb2-4sh1 and
pspb3-4sh1. the 0.6 kb bsmi/nsii and 1.5 kb nsii/bglii fragments
excised from pspb2-3sh1 and pspb2-4sh1 were replaced by those
from pspb2h1 to yield pspb2-3s5-1 and pspb2-4s6-1, respectively.
the 1.9 kb sﬁi/bspei and 0.8 kb bspei/srfi fragments from pspb3-3sh1
and pspb3-4sh1 were replaced by those from pspb3h2 to yield
pspb3-3s5-1 and pspb3-4s6-1, respectively.
subcloning and mutagenesis procedures were veriﬁed by restriction enzyme analysis and dna sequencing. in pspb2-3s5-1 and
pspb2-4s6-1, the amino acid residues lys1287 and phe1699 of alpha1e were
replaced with met (a r-type mutant alpha1ekm) and leu (another r-type
mutant alpha1efl), respectively. in pspb3-3s5-1 and pspb3-4s6-1, the
amino acid residues met1295 and leu1697 of alpha1b were replaced with
lys (an n-type mutant alpha1bmk) and phe (another n-type mutant
alpha1blf), respectively.
2.3. in vitro transcription
crnas speciﬁc for the mutants alpha1ekm, alpha1efl, alpha1bmk and alpha1blf
were synthesized in vitro using a megascript sp6 kit (ambion, austin,
tx). methods for in vitro transcription of crnas speciﬁc for wild-type
 xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  (alpha1e, alpha1b and alpha1a) and the ca2+ channel  xxxg831xxx /delta1 and beta1a subunits
and procedures for functional expression of ca2+ channels in xenopus
oocytes were described previously (furukawa et al., 1998, 1999).
the present study has been approved by the animal ethical
committee of the tokyo institute of psychiatry. female xenopus laevis
were anaesthetized with 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, and then, a
mini-laparotomy was performed to obtain ovarian sacs. after removal
of the follicular cell layer, xenopus oocytes were injected with 0.3 mug/mul
the mutant  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx , alpha1e (niidome et al., 1992), alpha1b (fujita et al., 1993) or
alpha1a (mori et al., 1991) crna in combination with 0.2 mug/mul  xxxg831xxx /delta1
(mikami et al., 1989) crna and 0.1 mug/mul beta1a (mori et al., 1991) crna.
2.4. binding assay
after injection of channel subunit crnas, the oocytes were
cultured for 2 to 4 days. oocyte membranes were, then, prepared as
described previously (yamamoto et al., 1999). brieﬂy, after mechanical removal of vitelline envelope (stuhmer, 1992), stage v–vi oocytes
were frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed three times. then, oocytes
were homogenized in 10 vol of a 1 mm nahco3, 3 mm edta solution,
which contained protease inhibitors such as pepstatin a (1 mug/ml),
leupeptin (10 mug/ml), aprotinin (20 mug/ml), phenylmethanesulfonyl
ﬂuoride (200 mum),  xxxd302xxx  (0.1 mg/ml) and  xxxg344xxx  i
and ii (8 mug/ml each). the homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 g for
15 min, and then, the supernatant was centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx  000 g for
20 min. for binding assay, the 10 000 g pellet was resuspended in the
same solution. all procedures were carried out at 4 °c or on ice.
radioligand binding assays with tritium-labelled amlodipine {2[(2-aminoethoxy)-methyl]-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,4-dihydro-6-methyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid 3-ethyl 5-methyl ester, 82 ci/mmol}
were performed using 0.2–0.4 mg/ml of oocyte membranes (nayler

and gu, 1991). saturation experiments were conducted over a
concentration range of 0.15–12.15 nm [3h]amlodipine. non-speciﬁc
bindings were determined in the presence of 10 mum of nonradiolabelled amlodipine. [3h]amlodipine and non-radiolabelled
amlodipine, which were racemic mixtures, were generous gifts from
sumitomo pharmaceutical company limited (tokyo, japan). protein
concentrations were determined using a bio-rad protein assay kit
(bio-rad). the dissociation constant (kd) and the maximal number
of binding sites (bmax) were determined using computer programs

kell version 6 (biosoft, cambridge, uk) and prism 4.0 (graphpad
software, la jolla, ca). the data were not ﬁt well by a two-sites model
of binding.
2.5. electrophysiology
after injection of channel subunit crnas, the oocytes were
cultured for 2 to 4 days, and then, subjected to electrophysiological
measurement. they were placed in a small chamber perfused with

fig. 1. functional expression of wild-type and mutant n- and r-type ca2+ channels in xenopus oocytes. a, membrane currents were recorded from oocytes injected with crna for
one of six kinds of wild-type or mutant ca2+ channel  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunit [alpha1b (a), alpha1bmk (b), alpha1blf (c), alpha1e (d), alpha1ekm (e) and alpha1efl (f)] in combination with crnas for ca2+ channel  xxxg831xxx /delta1
and beta1a subunits. the external solution contained 10 mm ba2+. (left) inward ba2+ currents induced by step depolarizations (200 ms in duration) from a holding potential of
− 100 mv to + 10 mv. the records were taken before (open circles) and 5 min after application of 10 mum amlodipine (ﬁlled circles). (right) current–voltage (i–v) relationships for the
records shown in left. the membranes were held at − 100 mv and depolarized by a 200 ms test pulse from − 80 mv to + 40 mv with 10 mv steps. peak currents before (open circles)
and during (ﬁlled circles) exposure to 10 mum amlodipine are plotted against the membrane potential of test pulses. note that the peak current was inhibited prominently by
amlodipine in wild-type n-type (alpha1balpha2/delta1beta1a) channel (a) but not in wild-type r-type (alpha1ealpha2/delta1beta1a) channel (d). therefore, in the following experiments, the amplitude of peak
currents was used as a measure of the response to amlodipine. in practice, peak currents were measured before and after application of the drug, and the change was expressed as
their ratio. b, current blocking actions of amlodipine on wild-type and mutant n- and r-type ca2+ channels. blockades of wild-type n- (alpha1balpha2/delta1beta1a, alpha1b) or r-type (alpha1ealpha2/delta1beta1a, alpha1e)
channels, and mutant n-type (alpha1bmkalpha2/delta1beta1a, alpha1bmk; alpha1blfalpha2/delta1beta1a, alpha1blf) or r-type (alpha1ekmalpha2/delta1beta1a, alpha1ekm; alpha1eflalpha2/delta1beta1a, alpha1efl) channels by 10 mum amlodipine were measured at a
holding potential of −100 mv and expressed as ratios. the number of oocytes examined are indicated in parentheses. *, p b 0.05 and **, p b 0.01.

extracellular solution (ba2+ 10, na+ 90, k+ 2, hepes 5, and niﬂumic
acid 0.3, in mm, ph 7.5 with  xxxd390xxx  acid), and ba2+ currents
through expressed channels were measured by the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp method using a geneclamp 500 ampliﬁer (axon
instruments, foster city, ca). microelectrodes were ﬁlled with 3 m kcl,
and those showing a resistance of 0.5–1.2 momega were used. the
experimental chamber was 0.5 ml in volume, and was perfused
continuously (2.0 to 3.0 ml/min) with the extracellular solution. a
commercial software (pclamp version 6.0, axon instruments) was used
for generating voltage pulses, acquiring data and analyzing the currents.
the oocyte membrane was clamped at a holding potential of
−100 mv, and 200 ms step depolarizations were applied to induce
ba2+ currents. maximal inward ba2+ currents were also induced
every 15 s by a test pulse to 0, +10 or + 20 mv to monitor effects of
amlodipine during drug wash-in as well as after change in the holding
potentials (from −100 to − 80 and − 60 mv). the drug effect was
evaluated after 5 min of perfusion under the initial holding potential
of − 100 mv, and 1 min after changing to a new holding potential. we
repeated this set of experiment before and after application of a
certain concentration of amlodipine.
steady-state inactivation curves were obtained by changing the
holding potential from −100 mv. the half-inactivation potential (v1/2)
was −58.2 mv for n-type (n = 7) and −34.2 mv for r-type (n = 8) in
average. in the presence of 10 mum amlodipine, these steady-state
inactivation curves of n-type did not appear to be affected with a v1/2 of
−57.9 mv (n = 7).
because no detectable current changes were observed during
exposure to the vehicle (0.2%  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso)) for dhp, as
reported previously (furukawa et al., 1997), the concentration of
dmso in the bath solution was maintained at 0.2% throughout the
experiments. amlodipine was dissolved into dmso just before each
experiment and added to the bath solution to make the ﬁnal concentration. other drugs were purchased from sigma-aldrich (st. louis,
mi), unless otherwise noted. concentration–response curves were
ﬁtted to the hill equation: block (%) = 100/(1 + (ic50/[d])nh), where
ic50 is the concentration at half-blockade, [d] is the drug concentration, and nh is the hill coefﬁcient.

channels within 2 to 3 min without affecting the time course of
current activation and inactivation. the level of inhibition (∼50%) was
comparable to those of l-type alpha1calpha2/delta1beta1a (51%) and p/q-type alpha1aalpha2/
delta1beta1a (48%) channels by amlodipine (furukawa et al., 1999). in
addition, a “slowing” of the current activation, which has been
observed in g-protein-mediated inhibition of alpha1b channels (furukawa et al., 1998), was not seen. by contrast, amlodipine hardly
inﬂuenced r-type channels (fig. 1a, d, ﬁlled circles), indicating that the
agent is not categorized into l-type-selective dhp. we have further
investigated the blocking actions of amlodipine on ca2+ channel using
mutagenesis of n- and r-type channels.
3.2. mutagenesis of the  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunits of n- and r-type ca2+ channels
as previously reported (furukawa et al., 1999), a combination of
auxiliary ca2+ channel subunits ( xxxg831xxx /delta1 and beta1a subunits) were coexpressed with each one of  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunit isotypes (alpha1b, alpha1a, alpha1e and alpha1c).
therefore, these differential blockades are accounted for by the structural
differences among the  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunits (hering et al., 1998; hockerman et al.,
1997; striessnig et al., 1998), although the combination of  xxxg831xxx /delta and beta
subunits is known to modulate dhp actions on the l-type ca2+ channel
(mitterdorfer et al., 1994; wei et al., 1995). moreover, among 10 kinds of
dhp derivatives examined, amlodipine is the most potent blocker of ntype ca2+ channels (furukawa et al., 1999).
as shown in fig. 2, the transmembrane regions iiis5, iiis6 and ivs6
of the alpha1c and alpha1s subunits of l-type ca2+ channels are known to be
involved in dhp binding, and 12 amino acid residues (fig. 2, asterisks)
have been determined to interact with dhps (he et al., 1997; peterson

2.6. statistical analysis
data from multiple experiments are expressed by means ± s.e.m.
statistical analyses were performed with analysis of variance followed
by a dunnett post hoc test. a p value less than 0.05 was considered
signiﬁcant.
3. results
3.1. functional expression of n- and r-type ca2+ channels in xenopus
oocytes
to evaluate the effects of amlodipine, a dhp derivative, on
neuronal ca2+ channels, n-, p/q- and r-type channels were expressed
in xenopus oocytes by injection of a crna speciﬁc for ca2+ channel  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx 
subunit (alpha1b, alpha1a or alpha1e) in combination with crnas speciﬁc for ca2+
channel  xxxg831xxx /delta1 and beta1a subunits, and their responses to 10 mum
amlodipine were examined using the conventional two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. fig. 1a illustrates inward ba2+
currents recorded from xenopus oocytes implanted with n-type
alpha1balpha2/delta1beta1a (a, left, open circle) or r-type alpha1ealpha2/delta1beta1a (d, left, open
circle) channels together with their current–voltage (i–v) relationships (a,d, right, open circles). step depolarizations from a holding
potential of −100 mv produced long-lasting inward currents at
potentials more positive than − 30 mv (a, d; right, open circles), as
previously reported alpha1a channels (furukawa et al., 1998, 1999).
bath application of 10 mum amlodipine (fig. 1a, a, ﬁlled circles)
reduced the amplitude of the inward currents through n-type

acid residues critical for the interaction of dhps with l-type ca2+ channels (see

alpha1e, which corresponded to met1295 and leu1697, and met1394 and leu1806, in rabbit alpha1b

subunits. in rabbit alpha1b (d14157), alpha1a (x57477) and alpha1e (nm_001101716) we
employed, the amino acid sequences of these transmembrane regions iiis5, iiis6 and
ivs6 are identical to those for human alpha1b, alpha1a and alpha1e indicated.

we compared these transmembrane regions of  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunits between
amlodipine-insensitive r-type and amlodipine-sensitive l-, n- and p/
q-type ca2+ channels. two amino acid residues lys1287 in iiis5
(fig. 2a, arrow) and phe1699 in ivs6 (fig. 2c, arrow) of alpha1e were found
unique in r-type channel, which corresponded to met (met1295 in alpha1b
and met1394 in alpha1a) and leu (leu1697 in alpha1b and leu1806 in alpha1a) in nand p/q-type channels, respectively.
in order to identify the region of alpha1b interacting with amlodipine,
these amino acid residues were, then, exchanged between alpha1b and
alpha1e subunits (fig. 2, boxes), in which a mutant alpha1b was constructed
with an amino acid substitution of met1295lys (alpha1b mk) or
leu1697phe (alpha1blf), and a mutant alpha1e with an amino acid
substitution of lys1287met (alpha1ekm) or phe1699leu (alpha1efl).
next, we expressed these mutants channels in xenopus oocytes
and recorded ba2+ currents through alpha1bmk (fig. 1a, b, open circles),
alpha1blf (fig. 1a, c, open circles), alpha1ekm (fig. 1a, e, open circles) and
alpha1efl (fig. 1a, f, open circles) channels in combination with the  xxxg831xxx /delta1
and beta1a subunits. these ba2+ currents and their i–v relationships were
similar to those recorded from their parent wild-type alpha1b (fig. 1a, a,
open circles) and alpha1e (fig. 1a, d, open circles) channels. it appears,
therefore, that the mutagenesis on alpha1b and alpha1e does not much affect
the channel properties including their voltage dependencies.

3.3. amlodipine binding to wild-type and mutant n- and r-type ca2+
channels.
to examine whether mutations in the transmembrane regions
iiis5 and ivs6 affect the channel properties of amlodipine binding,
saturation binding assays for radioactive amlodipine were carried out
in xenopus oocyte membranes where either wild-type or mutant alpha1b,
alpha1a or alpha1e was expressed together with  xxxg831xxx /delta1 and beta1a.
bindings of amlodipine to the membranes prepared from oocytes
implanted with the wild-type n- (fig. 3d) or p/q-type (fig. 3c)
channels were well deﬁned, as compared with those from oocytes
lacking their  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunits (fig. 3a,b) even though the rest of channel
components,  xxxg831xxx /delta1 and beta1a, were expressed (fig. 3b). scatchard
analysis of the amlodipine binding to the wild-type n- or p/q-type
channel resulted in a linear plot (fig. 3c,d), suggesting a single
binding site for the exogenously-expressed n- and p/q-type channels
in xenopus oocytes as reported in native tissue membranes (nayler
and gu, 1991). unlike these n- and p/q-type channels, r-type
channels did not show detectable bindings for amlodipine (fig. 3g).
in the mutant alpha1bmk (fig. 3e) but not in alpha1blf (fig. 3f), the
amlodipine binding was not detected. by contrast, the binding of
amlodipine was also well deﬁned in the mutant alpha1ekm (fig. 3h) but
not in alpha1efl (fig. 3i).

table 1 summarizes the results of saturation bindings of amlodipine
to the wild-type and the mutant alpha1b, alpha1a and alpha1e channels. again, high
afﬁnity binding sites for amlodipine were not detectable unless the  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx 
subunits of ca2+ channels were expressed (none,  xxxg831xxx /delta1beta1a). in the case
of n- (alpha1balpha2/delta1beta1a) and p/q-type (alpha1aalpha2/delta1beta1a) channels, high afﬁnity
binding sites appeared. the dissociation constant kd was 3.08 and
2.04 nm, respectively, which were comparable with that (1.68 nm)
reported in rat cardiac membranes (nayler and gu, 1991). by contrast,
the high afﬁnity binding of amlodipine was not observed in r-type
channel (alpha1ealpha2/delta1beta1a).
in this r-type channel, the amino acid substitution in the
transmembrane region iiis5 of alpha1e conferred a high afﬁnity binding
site for amlodipine (alpha1ekmalpha2/delta1beta1a), though the kd (13.1 nm) was 4fold higher than that (3.08 nm) of wild-type n-type channel. in ntype channel, reversely, the amino acid substitution in the trans-

19

membrane region iiis5 of alpha1b deprived the high afﬁnity binding site
for amlodipine (alpha1bmkalpha2/delta1beta1a).
on the other hand, the amino acid substitutions in another transmembrane region ivs6 of alpha1b (alpha1blfalpha2/delta1beta1a) and alpha1e (alpha1eflalpha2/delta1beta1a)
did not affect the binding properties of amlodipine as compared with
the wild-type n- (alpha1balpha2/delta1beta1a) and r-type (alpha1ealpha2/delta1beta1a) channels,
respectively.
3.4. blockade of mutant n- and r-type ca2+ channel activities by amlodipine
to examine whether mutations in the transmembrane regions
iiis5 and ivs6 affect the blocking action of amlodipine on the channel
activities, the effects of 10 mum amlodipine were analyzed at a holding
potential of −100 mv. in fig. 1b, we summarize the data obtained
from the channel traces as shown in fig. 1a.
amlodipine hardly inhibited the mutant alpha1bmk (fig. 1b, alpha1bmk) as
compared with the wild-type n-type channels (alpha1b) and prominently
inhibited the mutant alpha1ekm (alpha1ekm) unlike the wild-type r-type
channels (alpha1e). by contrast, the amlodipine-induced inhibition of the
mutant alpha1efl (fig. 1b, alpha1efl) was scarcely observed as shown in the
wild-type r-type channels (alpha1e). in contrast to the binding analysis in
which the leu1697phe substitution on alpha1b did not affect the
amlodipine binding to n-type channels (fig. 3f; table 1, alpha1blfalpha2/
delta1beta1a), however, the inhibition of the mutant alpha1blf by amlodipine
(fig. 1b, alpha1blf) was signiﬁcantly decreased as compared with the
wild-type n-type channels (alpha1b).
in isolated blood vessels, amlodipine slowly inhibits the muscle
contraction (burges et al., 1987). by contrast, amlodipine-induced
inhibition of l-type ca2+ channels is rapid, where amlodipine (near
ic50) can achieve a stable inhibition within 1 min (hughes and
wijetunge, 1993). under the present experimental conditions (at a
holding potential of − 100 mv), the time constant (s) of blocking by
10 mum amlodipine was 90.8 ± 8.1 (n = 7), 85.4 ± 5.5 (n = 7), 75.4 ± 4

fig. 4. concentration–response curves for effects of amlodipine on wild-type and mutant n- and r-type ca2+ channels. blockades of wild-type n- (alpha1balpha2/delta1beta1a, a) or r-type (alpha1ealpha2/

potentials of − 100 (ﬁlled circles), − 80 (ﬁlled squares) and − 60 mv (ﬁlled triangles) and plotted as a function of the drug concentration. the ic50 and nh obtained from these dose
−response curves are listed in table 2.

(n = 7), 67.1 ± 2.9 (n = 7) and 58.8 ± 3.0 (n = 7) in wild-type alpha1e
channel, and the mutants alpha1bmk, alpha1blf, alpha1ekm and alpha1efl channels,
respectively, which were comparable to those observed in wild-type
l-type alpha1c (75.1 ± 10.2) and n-type alpha1b (93.8 ± 7.4) channels
(furukawa et al., 1997). considering these time constants of blocking,
perfusion of amlodipine for 5 min was enough to reach a steady-state
blocking (furukawa et al., 1999).
as shown in fig. 4, in the next step, the effects of amlodipine on
these wild-type alpha1b (fig. 4a) and alpha1e (fig. 4d) channels and mutant
alpha1bmk (fig. 4b), alpha1blf (fig. 4c), alpha1ekm (fig. 4e) and alpha1efl (fig. 4f)
channels were investigated on the dose- and voltage-dependencies.
the oocytes were clamped at holding potentials of −100, −80 and
− 60 mv, and the channel blockades by amlodipine at various
concentrations of the drug were measured. in any case we observed,
the blockade by amlodipine was concentration-dependent and
potentiated as depolarizing the holding potential.
to evaluate the selectivity of the blocking action of amlodipine
among these mutant ca2+ channels, the drug concentrations to
induce half-blockade, ic50s, were compared with those for wild-type
channels in table 2. the ic50 values were conveniently compared at a
holding potential of − 60 mv.
in the n-type-derived mutant alpha1bmk (table 2, alpha1bmkalpha2/delta1beta1a),
the ic50 value (29.6 mum) was markedly increased as compared with
those for wild-type n- (2.7 mum, alpha1balpha2/delta1beta1a) and p/q-type (4.2 mum,
alpha1aalpha2/delta1beta1a) channels. in contrast to the binding results, in which the
kd value for amlodipine binding to another n-type mutant alpha1blf was
not affected by the amino acid substitution leu1697phe on alpha1b
(table 1), the ic50 value (20.6 mum) was increased in the mutant alpha1blf
(table 2, alpha1blfalpha2/delta1beta1a) to the similar level of alpha1bmk (29.6 mum).
reversely, the ic50 value (11.3 mum) for the r-type-derived mutant
alpha1ekm (table 2, alpha1ekmalpha2/delta1beta1a) was prominently decreased as
compared with that (931 mum) for the wild-type r-type channels
(alpha1ealpha2/delta1beta1a). in amlodipine binding to another r-type mutant alpha1efl,
high afﬁnity binding sites never appeared by the amino acid
substitution phe1699leu on alpha1e (table 1). in channel blockade, however, the ic50 value (55.3 mum) was decreased in the mutant alpha1efl (table 2,
alpha1eflalpha2/delta1beta1a) as observed in the mutant alpha1ekm (alpha1ekmalpha2/delta1beta1a),
although the ic50 value (55.3 mum) in alpha1efl was 5-fold higher compared

holding potentials, although the drug effect was reduced as the holding
potential was more hyperpolarized (table 2).
4. discussion
in the present study, we found that n- and p/q-type ca2+
channels, when expressed as alpha1balpha2/delta1beta1a and alpha1aalpha2/delta1beta1a combinations in xenopus oocytes, formed a high afﬁnity binding site for
amlodipine and showed a high sensitivity to amlodipine. the kd
values for amlodipine binding to n- and p/q-type channels were 3.08
and 2.04 nm and the ic50 values for blockade of n- and p/q-type
channels were 2.7 and 4.2 mum at a holding potential of − 60 mv,
respectively. by contrast, the high afﬁnity binding site was not
observed in r-type ca2+ channels (alpha1ealpha2/delta1beta1a), which were
insensitive to amlodipine. in comparison of amino acid sequences in
the transmembrane regions iiis5, iiis6 and ivs6 of  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  subunits of high
voltage-activated ca2+ channels, two amino acid residues lys1287 and
phe1699 were found to be unique in dhp-insensitive r-type channel,
which corresponded to met1295 and leu1697, and met1394 and leu1806,
in amlodipine-sensitive n- and p/q-type channels, respectively. an
amino acid substitution met1295lys in the iiis5 region of alpha1b, but not
another amino acid substitution leu1697phe in the ivs6 region of alpha1b,
deprived the high afﬁnity binding site for amlodipine from n-type
channels. in the blockade of channel activities, however, the both
amino acid substitutions met1295lys and leu1697phe reduced the
inhibitory actions of amlodipine on n-type channels to the similar
level. reversely, an amino acid substitution lys1287met in the iiis5
region of alpha1e, but not another amino acid substitution phe1699leu in
the ivs6 region of alpha1e, conferred the high afﬁnity binding site for
amlodipine on r-type channels. however, the both amino acid
substitutions lys1287met and phe1699leu enhanced the blocking
actions of amlodipine on r-type channels, although the lys1287met
substitution was more effective in enhancement than phe1699leu.
taken together, these ﬁndings provide evidence that the met1295 in
the region iiis5 of the alpha1b subunit of  xxxg303xxx  is critical for
amlodipine to exert both binding and blocking actions on the n-type
channel, and that the leu1697 in the region ivs6 of alpha1b is critical for
amlodipine to block the n-type channel.
the unique pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic proﬁles of
amlodipine, which is positively charged at physiological ph (mason
et al., 1989), are its slow onset and long duration of activity on ca2+
channels (arrowsmith et al., 1986). in comparison of location and
binding for amlodipine with uncharged dhps such as  xxxd2728xxx  in
cardiac membranes (mason et al., 1989), this unusual properties of
amlodipine are implied by both hydrophobic and electrostatic
interactions between amlodipine and the membranes, in which the
hydrophobic interaction is a common energetically favorable interaction in dhps and the ionic interaction is unique for amlodipine.
moreover, the membrane partition coefﬁcient into light sarcoplasmic
reticulum for amlodipine is higher than that observed for most
uncharged dhps (mason et al., 1989). thus, the unique ionic
interaction of amlodipine appears to be correlated with these novel
pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic proﬁles of amlodipine.
in the molecular modeling of interactions of amlodipine with the
inner pore of l-type ca2+ channel, amlodipine exceptionally interacts
with the carbonyl oxygen side chain of gln-9 in the iiis5 region of alpha1c
(see fig. 2a, the 2nd asterisk in iiis5) through its protonated amine atom
of the ﬂexible aminoethyl–oxymethyl group at the dhp ring, in addition
to the interaction of the n1 hydrogen atom of the heterocyclic ring of
dhps including amlodipine with the same side chain of gln-9 (cosconati
et al., 2007). this is not inconsistent with a new structural model of dhp
binding to l-type channel, in which the starboard extension of
amlodipine including the protonated amine atom projects toward the
interface between domains iii and iv (tikhonov and zhorov, 2009).
although the inner pore structure of n-type channel in detail, which is

y. miyashita et al. / european journal of pharmacology 632 (2010) 14–22

constructed using the x-ray structures of crystallized ion channels
(cosconati et al., 2007; lipkind and fozzard, 2003), has not been shown,
it is possible that both n- and l-type channels have a similar inner pore
structure, since the transfer of only 3 amino acid residues in ivs6 is
sufﬁcient for blocking alpha1a channel by benzothiazepine diltiazem and
phenylalkylamine (−)-gallopamil (hering et al., 1996) and the transfer
of only 8 amino acid residues in iiis5, iiis6 and ivs6 is sufﬁcient for
blocking alpha1e channel by dhp isradipine (ito et al., 1997). therefore, the
replacement of met-6 (met1295) near the gln-9 in the iiis5 region of alpha1b
with a basic amino acid residue lys (lys1287) for alpha1e might be
unfavorable for such a electrostatic interactions of amlodipine. the
feasibility of the interaction of amlodipine with met1295 is supported by
the study of the inner pore of p/q-type channels using the substitutedcysteine accessibility method, in which the replacement of the
corresponding met (met1394) with cys in the iiis5 region of alpha1a subjects
to the apparent modiﬁcation by internal methanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium (zhen et al., 2005). however, it cannot be denied
that the loss of high afﬁnity binding site for amlodipine in the mutant
alpha1bmk is due to allosteric effects by the met1295lys substitution
(schleifer, 1999).
in the interaction of amlodipine with the ivs6 region, the 4-aryl
substituent (the o-chloro substituent in amlodipine) of dhp is in close
contact with tyr-9 (see fig. 2c, the 1st asterisk) in the ivs6 region of
alpha1c engaging with this residue a t-shaped charge-transfer interaction
(cosconati et al., 2007). the leu1697phe substitution might reduce
such an interaction of amlodipine with ivs6 due to unfavorable steric
effects of the bulky aromatic phenylalanine.
based upon the present results together with these previous
ﬁndings, amlodipine appears to block  xxxg303xxx  in a twostep way. firstly, amlodipine binds to the region iiis5 of alpha1b of n-type
channel with nm order, which is a unique ionic interaction of
amlodipine. then, amlodipine is allowed to block the channel by
interacting with the region ivs6 of alpha1b with mum order, which is a
common interaction of amlodipine as a dhp derivative.
genetically engineered mice lacking the alpha1b subunit of n-type ca2+
channel have shown that n-type channel is essential for development of
neuropathic pain in vivo (saegusa et al., 2001). therefore, blockers of ntype channel could be candidates for analgesic drug to prevent
neuropathic pain. amlodipine, and also cilnidipine, both of which can
certainly block n- and p/q-type ca2+ channels (furukawa et al., 1999),
are known to have the antinociceptive action at the primary afferent
neurons in mice (murakami et al., 2001). this is consistent with the
fact that analgesic effects are exerted by omega-conotoxin, a peptide blocker
of n-type channels (miljanich and ramachandran, 1995; murakami
et al., 2001). however, clinical application of omega-conopeptide has not
been successful due to its adverse effects (penn and paice, 2000).
moreover, l-type selective antagonists, such as nifedipine, verapamil
and diltiazem, are considerably less potent in inducing antinociception (miljanich and ramachandran, 1995). for these reasons, it
appears that the blockade of n-type channel is responsible for the
antinociceptive action of amlodipine.
in in vivo system, amlodipine and cilnidipine are also shown to
reduce sympathetic tones as measured by heart rate variability
(hamada et al., 1998; minami et al., 1998). by contrast, these
sympatholytic reactions have not been shown in l-type selective
dhps. therefore, the blocking action of these dhps on n-type channel
may be related to the characteristics of autonomic modulation. this is
supported by the results in the alpha1b-deﬁcient mice, in which
sympathetic, but not parasympathetic, nerve activity is diminished
(ino et al., 2001).
5. conclusion
in addition to  xxxg303xxx  as a key mediator of the pain
pathway, p/q-type channel malfunction is implicated in the pathophysiology of certain forms of migraine, ataxia and epilepsy (doyle

21

and stubbs, 1998; ophoff et al., 1998). although the in vivo effects of
dhp action on n- and p/q-type ca2+ channels are totally unknown,
these neuronal ca2+ channels represent therapeutic targets for novel
drugs. for this reason, the major challenge in the ﬁeld of ca2+ channel
research is now to develop selective non-peptide modulators of
certain non-l-type channels. the ﬁndings in this study would provide
a clue to develop selective dhps for every non-l-type neuronal ca2+
channel.
