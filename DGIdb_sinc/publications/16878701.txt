reconstitution system based on cytosol-depleted cells
to study the regulation of phospholipase d
amanda fensome-green and shamshad cockcroft

summary
phospholipase d (pld) hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to produce the membraneassociated second messenger, phosphatidic acid (pa) and choline. two phospholipase d
enzymes— xxxg1772xxx  and  xxxg1773xxx —have been identified, although their regulatory mechanisms are yet to be fully understood. to study the regulation of pld, we established a
reconstitution system that allows the study of the pld enzymes in their native environment while enabling the cytosol to be manipulated. cells are permeabilized with a bacterial cytolysin (streptolysin o), which produces lesions in the plasma membrane, resulting
in the release of cytosolic proteins. with increasing permeabilization times, guanosine
5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate and receptor-activated pld activity diminishes. once the conditions for the run-down of the response is established, cellular factors, such as cytosol and
purified proteins, can be added to these cells to restore activity. in addition to examining
pld activity, this reconstitution system allows the study of potential cellular targets of
pa, such as phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (pip) 5-kinase activity by monitoring pip2
synthesis, and also functional outputs, such as exocytosis.
key words: arf; phosphatidylcholine; phosphatidate; streptolysin o; alcohols; permeabilization.

1. introduction
cell-surface receptors regulate hydrolysis of cellular phospholipids that are
catalyzed by different classes of phospholipases having distinct specificities.
depending on cell type and stimulus, multiple lipid signaling pathways are
initiated to allow for the physiological response of the cell to be manifested.
thus, receptors can be coupled to activation of the inositol lipid-specific phospholipase c and the phosphatidylcholine (pc)-specific phospholipase d (pld)
and this gives rise to multiple second messengers.

fig. 1. hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (pc) by phospholipase d (pld) produces choline and phosphatidic acid (pa). either product can be assayed as a monitor
of pld activity. however, pa is rapidly metabolized; therefore, it generally is assayed as the stable product, phosphatidylbutanol (pbut), in the presence of 0.2% to
0.5% butanol. hydrolysis of pc by pld occurs in two steps. initially, pld binds to
pc and the first part of the reaction involves the formation of a pa–pld intermediate
by covalent linkage of pa to a histidine residue and the release of the choline
headgroup. either water or a primary alcohol (e.g., butanol) can act as a nucleophile in
the second stage of the reaction. in the presence of water, the reaction product is pa,
and in the presence of butanol, the reaction production is the metabolically stable product, pbut. pbut has to be separated by thin-layer chromatography, whereas choline,
which is water-soluble, can be separated by column chromatography.

pld catalyses the hydrolysis of pc to produce the lipid-soluble metabolite
phosphatidic acid (pa), and the water-soluble headgroup, choline (fig. 1; refs.
1–3). there are two pld enzymes,  xxxg1772xxx  and  xxxg1773xxx , and the activities of both
enzymes are increased when g protein-coupled receptors or receptors that regulate tyrosine kinases are occupied by appropriate agonists. the regulatory
mechanisms concerning  xxxg1772xxx  and  xxxg1773xxx  are still being elucidated. the adpribosylation factor (arf) ( xxxg186xxx –6) and rho (rac, rho, and cdc42) family of
guanosine triphosphatases (gtpases) have all been identified as regulators of
mammalian  xxxg1772xxx . in addition, conventional isoforms of protein kinase c (alpha,
betai, betaii, and gamma) also can activate  xxxg1772xxx  directly. more importantly, the activation of  xxxg1772xxx  by the three regulators, arf, rho, and protein kinase c (pkc), is
synergistic, indicating that these activators interact at different sites of the
 xxxg1772xxx  molecule.  xxxg1773xxx  also is regulated in a complex manner and  xxxd2777xxx ,
arf proteins, and pkc all can increase  xxxg1773xxx  activity. the activity of  xxxg1772xxx 
and  xxxg1773xxx  also can be modulated (inhibitory or excitatory) by many soluble
proteins, including gm2 activator (4,5), actin (6), alpha-actinin (7), and synuclein (8).
to study pld isozymes in their native environment, it is essential to set up
cell-based assays where it is possible to study their regulation by cell-surface

receptors and their modulation by other cellular factors. an important consideration when studying plds is the presentation of the lipid substrate, pc,
because the presence of other lipids will profoundly influence the activity. both
 xxxg1772xxx  and  xxxg1773xxx  have a requirement for phosphoinositides with
phosphatidylinositol(4,5)bisphosphate being probably the most important in
this regard. both  xxxg1772xxx  and  xxxg1773xxx  contain a ph and a px domain. these domains
commonly are found in many proteins and, where examined, have been shown to
bind phosphoinositides (9). ph domains can bind a variety of phosphoinositides,
whereas the px domain can bind pi3p. in addition, a basic region also has been
identified as a pip2 binding site (10). by using permeabilized cells where the
cytosolic compartment can be manipulated, the enzymes can be studied in their
native environment because both the lipid substrates and the enzymes ( xxxg1772xxx 
and  xxxg1773xxx ) remain cell-associated and, hence, in their native state. the use of
lipid micelles or vesicles as a source of substrate for the enzyme inevitably
leads to loss of many subtle aspects of pld regulation and is a poor reflection
of the cellular environment that these enzymes normally operate in.
an additional advantage of the permeabilized cell system is that many of the
functions controlled by the putative second messenger, pa, can also be examined. thus, the permeabilized system can be used to examine the production of
pi(4,5)p2 by the activators of pld (11–13). here, we describe the use of a
permeabilized cell system that has powerful applications with respect to
examination of both the regulators (e.g., arf proteins [14], pkc [15], oleic
acid [16]) and modulators of pld (e.g., gm2 activator [5]). permeabilization of
cells is used to deplete cytosolic proteins, and this leads to loss of receptoractivated pld activity. cytosol or specific proteins can be re-introduced into
the cells and this is sufficient to restore receptor-activated pld activity. for
cytosol depletion, cells are permeabilized with streptolysin o, a bacterial (streptococcal) cytolysin, which generates large lesions (approx 15 nm in diameter)
in the plasma membrane of cells. the protocol detailed below can be used for
studying both g protein-coupled receptors (17) and for studying tyrosine
kinase receptors (11). in addition, the receptor can be by-passed when g protein-coupled receptors are being studied by using gtpgammas, the nonhydrolyzable
analog of gtp, to directly activate g proteins of both heterotrimeric, as well as
monomeric, gtp-binding proteins of the ras superfamily (15).
activation of pld should be examined under different states of the cell to
establish the quality of the restoration with specific proteins (fig. 2). in the
first instance, the responsiveness of the system is established by examining
“acutely permeabilized” cells, which will determine the extent of the response
one is likely to obtain under the most optimal conditions. here, the receptor
agonist (or gtpgammas) is added simultaneously with streptolysin o (slo). under
these conditions, the activation of pld occurs while the majority of the cellular proteins are still present in the cells. entry of gtpgammas into the permeabilized

302

fig. 2. illustration of the method used for restoration of g protein-regulated phospholipase d (pld) activity in permeabilized cell preparations. three steps are described. (a) pld activity is monitored in acutely permeabilized cells, conditions in
which guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (gtpgammas) and the permeabilizing agent, streptolysin o (slo), are added simultaneously. activation by gtpgammas occurs in the presence of cytosolic proteins and maximal stimulation is observed. (b) when cells are
incubated with slo first to deplete the cytosolic proteins, the ability of gtpgammas to
stimulate phospholipase d activity in the “cytosol-depleted” cells is impaired despite
the presence of membrane-associated pld. (c) “cytosol-depleted” cells are reconstituted with addition of exogenous cytosol (or purified proteins, e.g., arf).

cells occurs within seconds, whereas the loss of the cytosolic proteins from the
cells occurs in 5 to 10 min. this activity is simply attributable to the size of the
molecules. in addition, gtpgammas will retard the loss of arf proteins by translocating them to membranes (13).
the second step establishes conditions that leads to “run-down” so that the
ability of the cells to respond to gtpgammas (or a receptor-directed agonist) becomes
refractory. this refractory state is achieved by permeabilizing the cells first to
allow the leakage of the cytosolic proteins. these cells are referred to as “cytosol-depleted” cells. conditions for run-down should be empirically determined
for each cell type. some proteins are freely diffusable (e.g.,  xxxg186xxx ) and will be
released within 5 to 10 min but other proteins are associated with the membrane or cytoskeleton and are only released over a longer period of time (30–
45 min), for instance, rac proteins (see notes 1 and 2 and ref. 18).

the third and final step is to restore activation by the re-addition of exogenous cytosol or known proteins that are suspected to be required for pld signaling. if the identity of the proteins is not known, then the cytosol can be
fractionated and the reconstituting factor(s) purified.
2. materials
1. slo can be purchased from sigma (cat. no. s-140). the slo is supplied in powder form and it is reconstituted in 2 ml of distilled water to give a stock solution
of 20 iu/ml. (international units are the manufacturer’s arbitrary units.) this
solution can be kept at 4°c for 1–2 wk. the solution can get cloudy with time and
can be partially clarified on warming at 37°c. however, the cloudiness does not
affect permeabilization. alternatively, the solution can be kept frozen in 50- to
100-mul aliquots at –20°c and used over the course of a 6-mo period.
2. both primary and cultured cells have been used successfully, including hl60
cells, rat basophilic leukemia mast cells, rat peritoneal mast cells, and human
neutrophils. these cells mainly are used as a cell suspension, although attached
cells also can be used, but depletion of cytosolic proteins is incomplete compared
with cells in suspension. alternatively, attached cells can be detached by
trypsinization or scraping and used in suspension.
3. permeabilization buffer: 20 mm na-piperazine-n,n'-bis(2-ethane sulfonic acid)
(pipes), 137 mm nacl, 2.7 mm kcl, ph 6.8. stock solution of na-pipes (1 m)
and a 20x stock of nacl/kcl are kept at 4°c till required. two milliliters of
stock na-pipes and 5 ml of stock nacl/kcl are diluted to 100 ml and made
fresh and the ph adjusted to 6.8. this buffer will be referred to as pipes. glucose 1 mg/ml (5.6 mm) and bovine  xxxg124xxx  1 mg/ml are added to the
pipes buffer to obtain the permeabilization buffer.
4. ca/ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)tetraacetic acid (egta) buffers. it is necessary to control the concentration of ca2+ between 10 nm and 10 mum (pca 8–pca
5). the resting level of cytosol ca2+ is 100 nm in most cells and increases to
micromolar levels upon stimulation; therefore, it is important to clamp the ca2+
concentration to a known value by using ca–egta buffers. the final egta
concentration is maintained at 3 mm. stock ca–egta buffers (100 mm) at specific free ca2+ concentrations are prepared and stored at –20°c. ca2+–egta
buffer stocks (100 mm) in the range of pca 8 (10 nm) to pca 5 (10 mum) are
prepared from stock solutions of ca–egta and egta of 100 mm concentration, which are then combined in varying proportions to achieve the desired value
of free ca2+ (table 1). these values have been obtained using the program chelate (19). the two stock solutions are prepared in pipes buffer (20 mm
na–pipes, 137 mm nacl, 2.7 mm kcl, ph 6.8). egta is purchased from fluka
because of high purity and cacl2 is analytical grade obtained from sigma.
5. mg  xxxd83xxx  (atp) is made up as a stock solution of 100 mm and
can be kept at –20°c for months. atp is purchased as a disodium dihydrogen
salt. to prepare 10 ml of 100 mm stock solution of mgatp, dissolve 605 mg in
10 ml of a solution containing 2 ml of 1 m tris and 1 ml of 1 m mgcl2. the use

ca–egta and egta solutions (100 mm) are mixed in the

checked with a ph electrode and adjusted accordingly. freeze-thaw of the solution
is not detrimental and 10-ml aliquots can be kept at –20°c and used repeatedly.
[methyl-3h]choline is purchased from amersham biosciences and kept sterile.

recombinant  xxxg186xxx  can be expressed in escherichia coli (15) and cytosol can be
prepared from rat brain.

3. methods
procedures are described for reconstitution of pld activity in permeabilized
hl60 cells stimulated with gtpgammas (fig. 2). three steps are described: the
first step outlines the experimental procedure for the following:
1. working with acutely permeabilized cells.
2. conditions to establish run-down.
3. the restoration of pld activity with arf proteins. (the method can be adapted
to examine any other regulators of pld activity.)

pld activity can be measured by two independent methods (fig. 1). the
method described here is suitable for working with permeabilized cells, which
rely on the release of labeled [3h]choline. the advantage of this method is that
many samples can be analyzed in a single experiment, which is essential if you
are screening many cytosolic fractions. an alternative method involves labeling of the cells with [3h] xxxd2681xxx  for 4 h to label the pc pool (12). in the
presence of butan-l-ol, phosphatidylbutanol (pbut) is produced at the expense

cell-free characterization of mammalian plds

305

of pa (fig. 1). transphosphatidylation is a hallmark of pld activity and provides
definitive evidence for pld activity. it is advisable to confirm the production
of pbut in a limited number of experiments, as choline release could occur by
other means. choline release requires simple column chromatography, whereas
the measurements of pbut require lipid extraction and separation by thin-layer
chromatography.
a typical experiment is illustrated in fig. 3. hl60 cells were permeabilized
for different times and subsequently assayed for gtpgammas-stimulated pld activity. as the permeabilization interval increases, the responsiveness of the cells
diminishes. the supernatants are analyzed for leaked arf proteins to demonstrate the depletion of these proteins from the cells. finally, the cytosol-depleted
cells are reconstituted with recombinant arf proteins to demonstrate that arf
proteins are responsible for pld activation.

3.1. assay of pld activity in acutely permeabilized cells
using [3h]choline release
1. labeling of cells: to measure pc-hydrolysing pld activity, the cells are labelled
with [methyl-3h]choline and release of radiolabeled choline is used as a monitor
of activity. hl60 cells normally are grown in rpmi-1640 medium with heatinactivated 12.5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 4 mm glutamine, 50 iu/ml penicillin,
and 50 mug/ml streptomycin. radiolabeling of hl60 cells is performed in medium
199 containing 10% fetal calf serum. this medium is used because of its low
choline content. hl60 cells are labelled with 0.5 muci/ml for 48 h. hl60 cells
grow to a density of 1–2 × 106 cells/ml and each assay tube has approx 1–2 × 106
cells. a total of 50 ml of cells is therefore sufficient for 50 separate assay conditions.
the experiment is always conducted in duplicate. [3h]choline is mainly incorporated into pc (87%) and sphingomyelin (13%). incorporation into the cholinecontaining lipids can be determined by extracting the total lipids (see step 8) and
measuring the level of incorporation in the extract. to obtain a good signal, each
assay tube should contain approx 105 disintegration per minute (dpm).
2. labeled hl60 cells (50 ml, 1–2 × 106 cell/ml) are centrifuged at 1000g for 5
min at room temperature. the medium is discarded and the cells resuspended in
40 ml of permeabilization buffer (i.e., pipes buffer containing albumin and glucose). the cells are pelleted by centrifugation and the process repeated once more.
after the final centrifugation, the cells are resuspended in 2 ml of permeabilization
buffer. the washed radiolabeled cells are equilibrated at 37°c for 10 to 15 min.
3. 1.5-ml eppendorf tubes are used for the assays. the final assay volume is 100
mul. 50 mul of reaction mixture is prepared in the eppendorf tubes containing
twice the concentration of slo (0.4 iu/ml final), mgatp (1 mm final), mgcl2
(2 mm final), ca2+ buffered with 3 mm egta (pca 5), and gtpgammas (10 mum final).
the eppendorf tubes containing the appropriate reagents are prepared at 4°c and
put into the water bath at 37°c for 5 min before the addition of the cells.
4. 50-mul aliquots of cells are transferred to the eppendorf tubes and incubated for
30 min.

fig. 3. (a) run-down of guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (gtpgammas)-stimulated
phospholipase d (pld) activity. [3h]-choline-labeled hl60 cells were permeabilized
and at the indicated times 50-mul aliquots were removed and incubated further in the
presence or absence of 10 mum gtpgammas. samples were quenched on ice and then analyzed for [3h]-choline release. the response observed at time 0 is the maximal
response observed in acutely permeabilized cells. as the time of permeabilization is
increased, the ability of gtpgammas to stimulate pld activity diminishes. (b) reduction of
gtpgammas-stimulated pld activity correlates with the release of arf proteins. hl60
cells were permeabilized for the indicated times, and 1-ml aliquots were removed and
centrifuged. the proteins in the supernatants (released proteins) were precipitated with
tca, and redissolved in sample buffer. samples (106 cell equivalents) were run on a
sodium  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page), transferred,
and probed with anti-arf antibodies. (c) restoration of gtpgammas-stimulated pld
activity by rarf1 (nonmyristoylated). much lower concentrations of arf proteins
can be used if the proteins are myristoylated. labeled hl60 cells were permeabilized
for 10 min and washed. the cells were then incubated at 37°c for 45 min in the presence of the indicated concentrations of rarf1 and gtpgammas.

5. the samples are quenched with 375 mul of a mixture of chloroform:methanol (1:2
by vol). the sample is vigorously vortexed and a single phase obtained. a further
addition of 125 mul of chloroform, and 125 mul of water is then made to obtain a
two-phase system. after vigorous mixing, the samples are centrifuged for 5 min
at 1000g. the lipids are present in the lower chloroform phase, and the top aqueous phase contains the water-soluble components including free [3h]choline. an
aliquot of the top phase is used to analyse the presence of [3h]choline.
6. [3h]choline is separated from glycerophosphocholine and  xxxd2929xxx  by
cation chromatography. the aqueous phase containing the choline metabolites
are applied to a 1-ml bed volume of bio-rex 70 cation exchange resin (sodium
form, mesh size 200–400 purchased from bio-rad) in a bio-rad column. the
column is rinsed with 3 ml of water to elute phosphorylated choline metabolites.
radiolabeled choline is quantitatively eluted with 3 ml of 50 mm glycine containing 500 mm nacl, ph 3.0, directly into scintillation vials. the bio-rex resin
is regenerated by extensively washing the resin with 0.5 m naoh, ph 9.0, followed by washing with water. the resin is then washed with 0.1 m sodium phosphate, ph 7.0, and finally washed with water.
7. the radioactivity is measured after addition of a scintillation cocktail that is able
to accommodate acidic solutions and high salt (e.g., ultima gold xr from
canberra packard).
8. calculation of data: the increase in labeled choline is expressed as a function of
the total radioactivity (dpm) incorporated in the total choline lipids, (which includes both pc and sphingomyelin). the total lipid chloroform extract is carefully removed from the eppendorf tube and transferred to a clean scintillation
vial and the chloroform is allowed to evaporate by leaving it overnight on the
bench (or the fume hood). then, 500 mul of methanol should be added to the dried
lipids followed by 2 ml of scintillation cocktail.

3.2. establishing conditions for run-down of pld activity
1. to establish conditions for the run-down of regulated pld activity, 4 ml (1–2 ×
107 cells/ml) of washed [3h]-choline-labeled cells are required. (this amount
equates to 50 ml of confluent hl60 cells [labeled] as a start material.)
2. a cocktail containing slo (0.4 iu/ml final), mgatp (1 mm final), and ca2+
(100 nm buffered with 100 mum egta final) in 1 ml is added to the labeled cells.
3. at timed permeabilization intervals (0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 25, 30, 40, 45, 60 min),
four aliquots of cells are withdrawn (50 mul) and transferred to duplicate assay
tubes containing 50 mul of ca2+ (pca 5 [10 mum] buffered with 3 mm egta final),
mgatp (1 mm final), mgcl2 (2 mm) ± gtpgammas (10 mum final).
4. assay tubes are incubated at 37°c for a further 30 min to monitor the extent of
gtpgammas-stimulated pld activity.
5. at the end of the incubation, the reactions are quenched as described previously
in subheading 3.1., step 5 for acutely permeabilized cells.
6. the data are plotted as the extent of the gtpgammas-stimulated pld activity as a
function of the permeabilization interval. the run-down of activity is seen as the

308

fensome-green and cockcroft
permeabilization interval increases and the optimum time for run-down determined (see notes 1–4).

3.3. reconstitution of gtpgammas-stimulated pld
by cytosolic factors in cytosol-depleted cells
having established the optimum period for observing run-down, the restoration of gtpgammas-stimulated pld activity can be performed using exogenously
added cytosol or purified proteins.
1. four milliliters of washed [3h]choline-labeled hl60 cells in permeabilization
buffer are incubated with a cocktail containing slo (0.4 iu/ml final), mgatp
(1 mm final), and ca2+ (100 nm buffered with 100 mum egta final) in 1 ml for
the appropriate time that achieves run-down (10–40 min).
2. after permeabilization, the cells are diluted with 40 ml of ice-cold permeabilization buffer and centrifuged at 2000g for 5 min at 4°c to pellet the cells.
3. the cells are resuspended in ice-cold permeabilization buffer and 50-mul aliquots
are transferred to assay tubes on ice. assay tubes contain 50 mul of ca2+ (pca 5
[10 mum] buffered with 3 mm egta final), mgatp (1 mm final), mgcl2 (2 mm)
± gtpgammas (10 mum final), and rat brain cytosol (1–3 mg/ml) or purified proteins
(such as arf, rho, or pkc).
4. assay tubes are transferred to a water bath and further incubated at 37°c for 30
min to monitor the extent of gtpgammas-stimulated pld activity.
5. at the end of the incubation, the reactions are transferred to ice and reactions
quenched as described previously in subheading 3.1., step 5 for acutely
permeabilized cells.

4. notes
1. depletion of proteins from the cytosol is dependent on their interactions with
membranes or cytoskeleton. truly cytosolic proteins exit with a faster timecourse compared with some proteins, which are loosely anchored in cells. for
example, release of  xxxg186xxx  occurs within 5 min, whereas release of  xxxg187xxx  can
vary between 5 min and incomplete at 30 min depending on cell type (11,13).
pkc release is also complete within 5 to 10 min, but rac and rho proteins remain cell-associated despite prolonged permeabilization (18). pld enzymes are
tightly membrane-associated because of palmitoylation and therefore remain cellassociated. therefore, the length of time used for the depletion of cytosolic proteins is important because it will dictate which proteins leak out. for any known
protein of interest, it is worthwhile to track the protein by western blotting using
appropriate antibodies in the supernatants obtained after pelleting the
permeabilized cells. it should never be assumed that a protein that is recovered in
the cytosol when cells are homogenized will leak out of the cells. rho-gdi is one
such protein that does not leak out of extensively permeabilized cells (18).
2. during the step for cytosol depletion, we routinely have mgatp (1 mm) present.
it is possible that in its presence some proteins may be retarded if their phosphorylation state is important in attachment to intracellular structures. in addi-

cell-free characterization of mammalian plds

309

tion, in the presence of mgatp, the pool of pi(4,5)p2 is maintained (20) and
many proteins are tethered to membranes by their association with this lipid.
depletion of proteins can also be carried out in the absence of mgatp which
does influence the time-course of run-down.
3. “run-down is variable; therefore, it is important to work under well-defined cell
densities and slo concentrations routinely. the concentration of slo can be
increased to 0.6 iu/ml if run-down is insufficient. normally, run-down of pld
activity is partial and routinely ranges from a loss of 70 to 90% of the response
seen in acutely-permeabilized cells.
4. this protocol can be applied to any cellular response and not just pld. we have
applied this protocol for purifying proteins required for phospholipase c regulated by either g protein-coupled receptors or bsy receptor tyrosine kinases (21)
and proteins required for exocytosis (15). in this case, run-down of the secretory
response is dependent on the absence of mgatp during the cytosol-depletion
step. in the presence of mgatp, run-down is slower compared with in the
absence of mgatp.
