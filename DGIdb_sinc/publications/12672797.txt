inhibitor of odc, is an approved drug for the treatment of
african sleeping sickness caused by the parasitic protozoa
trypanosoma brucei (2, 3). it has also been investigated as a
potential drug for the treatment of cancer and other proliferative diseases (reviewed in refs. 4 and 5).
x-ray structural analysis of the native enzymes from mouse
(6), t. brucei (7, 8), and human (9) demonstrates that the odc
monomer consists of two domains, an n-terminal ␤/␣-barrel
domain and a c-terminal ␤-sheet domain. the t. brucei structure has also been solved in complex with the product putrescine and with  xxxd1972xxx , identifying important active site residues
(7, 8). odc is an obligate homodimer, and the two identical
active sites are formed at the dimer interface, encompassing
the ␤/␣⫺barrel domain from one subunit and ␤⫺sheet domain
from the other. catalytic residues are contributed to the active
site from both monomers. both putrescine and  xxxd1972xxx  form a
covalent schiff base complex with the plp cofactor, and the
side-chain amino groups of both compounds bind in a well
conserved pocket that bridges between subunits. in addition
 xxxd1972xxx  has undergone decarboxylation and has formed a covalent bond to cys-360 as expected based on its mechanism of
inhibition (10).
the odc active site is invariant between the host and parasite enzymes; thus, selective toxicity of  xxxd1972xxx  for the parasite
is not achieved through differential inhibitor binding to the
enzyme active site (7). instead, it is thought to arise from
metabolic differences between the host and parasite, which
include the rapid turnover of host odc when compared with
that of the parasite (2, 11), and the requirement for the polyamine spermidine for the formation of the novel cofactor
trypanothione to maintain reduced thiol pools in the parasite
(12).
the discovery that  xxxd1972xxx  was curative against t. brucei
gambiense infections provided the first alternative to the
highly toxic melarsoprol for the treatment of late stage disease
(13). however, utilization of  xxxd1972xxx  is hampered by the large
dose requirement and by poor activity against the t. brucei
rhodesiense strain of the parasite (2). a number of small molecule inhibitors of odc have been reported, but like  xxxd1972xxx 
they target the highly conserved active site (14 –16). the discovery of novel odc inhibitors with chemical properties that
differ from substrate may overcome the poor pharmacology of
 xxxd1972xxx . we had observed previously (17) that mutations in the
dimer interface of odc distant from the active site decreased
catalytic activity. thus we sought to explore whether odc
could be inhibited allosterically by binding inhibitors to sites
outside of the active site.
we have identified an inhibitor of odc,  xxxg418xxx  sulfate ( xxxd2191xxx ), which is non-competitive with substrate. although the
inhibitor has a high ki (5– 8 mm) it was sufficiently inhibitory

 xxxg1626xxx  (odc) is a pyridoxal 5ⴕ-phosphate (plp)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the ratedetermining step in the biosynthesis of polyamines.
odc is a proven drug target to treat african sleeping
sickness. the x-ray crystal structure of trypanosoma
brucei odc in complex with d-ornithine (d-orn), a substrate analog, and  xxxg418xxx  ( xxxd2191xxx ), a weak non-competitive inhibitor, was determined to 2.5-å resolution. dorn forms a schiff base with plp, and the side chain is
in a similar position to that observed for putrescine and
␣- xxxd2430xxx  in previous t. brucei odc
structures. the d-orn carboxylate is positioned on the
solvent-exposed side of the active site (si face of plp),
and gly-199, gly-362, and his-197 are the only residues
within 4.2 å of this moiety. this structure confirms predictions that the carboxylate of d-orn binds on the si
face of plp, and it supports a model in which the carboxyl group of the substrate l-orn would be buried on
the re face of the cofactor in a pocket that includes
phe-397, tyr-389, lys-69 (methylene carbons), and asp361. electron density for  xxxg418xxx  was observed at the
boundary between the two domains within each odc
monomer. a ten-amino acid loop region (392– 401) near
the 2-fold axis of the dimer interface, which contributes
several residues that form the active site, is disordered
in this structure. the disordering of residues in the active site provides a potential mechanism for inhibition
by  xxxg418xxx  and suggests that allosteric inhibition from this
site is feasible.

substrate binding and odc conformational flexibility

to allow us to observe d-orn bound in the active site of odc.
previous attempts to co-crystallize d-orn and odc were unsuccessful, because the substrate analog was unexpectedly decarboxylated to putrescine (8). through crystallographic analysis of t. brucei odc,  xxxg418xxx , and d-orn, we have determined
the binding orientation of a carboxylated ligand. the structure
reported here, in combination with the  xxxd1972xxx -bound structure
and with mutagenic analysis, supports a model where the
substrate carboxylate is buried on the re face of plp on the
same face as lys-69. the inhibitor  xxxg418xxx  binds outside the
active site of odc in the interface between the two domains of
the odc monomer. a loop region (residues 392– 401) at the
symmetry-related center of the dimer interface, which contributes essential residues to the active site pocket, is disordered in
this structure. the disorder in this region of the active site may
explain the basis for inhibition of odc by  xxxg418xxx . this conformation, apparently available at low energy, is inactive and
could be useful in inhibitor design.
experimental procedures

materials

methods
odc expression and purification—odc was expressed from a t7
promoter in the bl21 (de3) strain of escherichia coli as described for
t. brucei (7, 8, 18) and human (9) odc. the protein was produced as an
n-terminal his6-tagged fusion that included a tobacco etch virus (tev)
protease cleavage site to allow removal of the tag. protein was purified
by column chromatography over nickel- xxxd2739xxx -agarose and
sephadex 200. for crystallography, the his tag was removed from
purified odc by digestion with tobacco etch virus (tev) protease
immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads as described (19). the purified protein for crystallization experiments was concentrated to 20 –25
mg/ml.
site-directed mutagenesis—d243a, l339a, and e384a mutants of
t. brucei odc were created using pcr-based mutagenesis of the podc29
expression plasmid using the quikchangetm site-directed mutagenesis
kit from stratagene (la jolla, ca). the primers listed below contain the
desired mutation (bold), and d243a and l339a also contain silent
mutations (bold italics), which remove a restriction site (bsedi and
stui, respectively) for diagnostic purposes: l339a forward, 5⬘-gaccacgcagtcgtcagacctgcgccccagagggagcc-3⬘; d243a forward, 5⬘-gtgggtttccaggtacgagggctgcaccacttaaatttg3⬘; e384a forward, 5⬘-ggctgctctttgcggatatgggtgcc-3⬘.
inhibitor identification— xxxg418xxx  and other aminoglycosides were identified as potential odc inhibitors by computational methods using the
available chemicals directory (1998 version).
enzyme assays—steady-state spectrophotometric assay of the decarboxylation of l-orn (0.1 to 16 mm) by odc (20 – 80 nm) was followed at
37 °c as described (18) using the sigma diagnostics carbon dioxide
detection kit (sigma) in the presence of 50 ␮m plp. in this assay co2
production is linked to the oxidation of nadh (␭max䡠nadh ⫽ 340 nm) by
coupling the odc reaction to  xxxg1679xxx  and
 xxxg1739xxx .
direct assay of l-orn decarboxylation by odc was performed by a
radioactive assay of 1-14c-l-orn. for this assay, a 2⫻ substrate solution, 1-14c-l-orn (32 ␮m) mixed with cold l-orn (0.8 mm) in buffer a
(0.2 m hepes, ph 7.5, 0.05 mm plp), was added to a culture tube by
injection with a hamilton syringe through a rubber stopper cap into a
2⫻ odc enzyme solution (0.25 ␮m odc in buffer a). after mixing, the
reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 °c for varied times (0 to 8 min)
and then quenched with 20% (final) trichloroacetic acid. sample chambers were incubated for another hour at 37 °c to evolve liberated
1-14co2 onto paper strips soaked with a saturated ba(oh)2 solution
that were hung in the chamber. the paper strips were submerged in
cytoscint scintillation mixture and counted for radioactive decay.
the ki and ic50 values for the inhibition of odc by  xxxg418xxx  sulfate
were determined by spectroscopic assay over a range of inhibitor concentrations (0 –16 mm). the inhibitors (at 1⫻) were preincubated with
odc (at 50⫻) in assay buffer for 15 min at 37 °c before addition to the
assay mixture. the assay mixture was also allowed to pre-incubate for

kinetic data were fitted to the appropriate equation with sigma plot
2001 version 7.0 (spss inc., chicago, il) to determine the kinetic
constants.
crystallization—t. brucei odc was co-crystallized with d-orn and
 xxxg418xxx  sulfate under the following conditions: t. brucei odc (23 mg/ml
in 10 mm hepes, ph 7.2, 50 mm nacl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm
edta, 0.01% brij-20) was preincubated with 25 mm d-orn and 100 mm
 xxxg418xxx  sulfate for 10 min at room temperature before setting crystal
drops. equal volumes of preincubated enzyme and well solution (20%
 xxxd2982xxx  3350, 100 mm hepes, ph 8.0, 10 mm dithiothreitol,
25 mm d-orn, ph 7.5, 100 mm  xxxg418xxx ) were used to form the crystal drops.
␥-butyrolactone, 3% (v/v) final, was added to the drops (final ph ⫽ 7.0).
the crystals formed overnight at 16 °c under conditions of vapor diffusion. crystals were cryoprotected in 1.2 ⫻ crystal conditions with 20%
ethylene glycol and frozen in propane. these conditions differed from
those used previously (8) to obtain the putrescine bound structure in
which the ␥-butyrolactone additive was not required, and the well
solution contained naoac in place of  xxxg418xxx  (20%  xxxd2982xxx 
3350, 100 mm hepes, ph 7.5, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 7.5 mm d-orn, 200
mm naoac).
data collection and processing—diffraction data were collected with
an r-axis iv image plate system (msc, houston, tx) mounted on a
rotating anode and operated at 100 ma and 50 kv, at the university of
texas southwestern medical center. data were processed with
hkl2000 (20). a summary of the statistics for data processing is given
in table i. there was a slight asymmetry in the resolution of the data
and also a telescoping effect in the spot shape. after screening many
crystals, data adequate for structure determination were collected.
wilson b-values were determined using ccp4 (21).2
structure determination and refinement—initial phases were calculated by molecular replacement using the program amore (23) and the
coordinates of a dimer from the t. brucei odc/put structure (8) (protein
data bank code 1f3t), with putrescine and waters removed, as a search
model. the model was built in o version 6.2.2 (24) and refined using
cns (25) utilizing data collected between 35 and 2.45 å. non-crystallographic symmetry constraints were kept for residues 38 –152, 170 –
291, and 317–390 for initial rounds of refinement, non-crystallographic
symmetry constraints were released for one round, and then restraints
were added again for residues 38 –152, 170 –238, 247–291, 317–340, and
350 –390 for the remainder of the refinement. the peptide torsion angles
for 1011 of 1180 non-glycine and non-proline residues fall within the most
favored regions, and there are none found in disallowed regions of the
ramachandran plot as determined by the program procheck (26).
water molecules were added using cns and edited in the program o.
refinement statistics are listed in table i. the coordinates have been
placed in the protein data bank (protein data bank code  xxxd2191xxx ).
superposition of crystal structures and determination of r.m.s.d.
between structure coordinates—c monomers from each of the following
t. brucei odc structures, native odc (protein data bank code 1qu4;
native_odc), k69a odc inactivated with  xxxd1972xxx  (protein data bank
code 2tod; k69_odc/ xxxd1972xxx ), and the structure reported in this paper
(odc/ xxxg418xxx /d-orn), were superimposed with the structure of odc in
complex with putrescine (protein data bank code 1f3t; odc/put) using
insight ii (accelrys, san diego, ca). monomers from each structure
were pared down to include only shared residues 37– 68, 70 –157, 168 –
296, 312–344, 348 –391, and 402– 409, and backbone atoms from residues 320 –340 and 350 –380 (from the ␤-sheet domain) were superimposed. superimposed monomers were written out into the same

results

analysis of the inhibition of t. brucei odc activity by  xxxg418xxx 
sulfate— xxxg418xxx  sulfate is a weak non-competitive inhibitor of
odc with respect to l-orn.  xxxg418xxx  has a ki of 8 mm at ph 7.0 and
4.5 mm at ph 8.0. pre-incubation of odc with  xxxg418xxx  to establish
equilibrium before assaying for activity was required to observe
constant inhibition suggesting a slow binding step or a slow
conformational change promoted by  xxxg418xxx . inhibition was observed using both the enzyme-linked and the direct, radioactive
decarboxylation assays. because primary amines are able to
form a schiff base with the plp cofactor, the observed noncompetitive inhibition could result from to the sequestration of plp
by the high concentration of  xxxg418xxx  (an amine) used. to test for
this possibility, we assayed for inhibition over a range of plp
concentrations (10 –200 ␮m), and the inhibition remained constant, suggesting that plp sequestration is not the mechanism
of inhibition. controls containing equivalent concentrations of
the inhibitor counter ions (nacl or kso4) were also performed.
no inhibition was seen under these conditions. similar results
for inhibition of human odc by  xxxg418xxx  were obtained.
crystallization, data collection, and structure determination—t. brucei odc was co-crystallized with d-orn and  xxxg418xxx .

group p21 (a ⫽ 67.8 å, b ⫽ 88.5 å, c ⫽ 150.4 å, ␤ ⫽ 90.03°) with
two homodimers in the asymmetric unit. the final model contains four monomers, 1404 residues, four plp, four d-orn,
three  xxxg418xxx , and 207 water molecules. the r-factor is 26.0%
with an rfree of 28.3% for data between 35- and 2.45-å resolution (table i). representative electron density for the plp/dorn and  xxxg418xxx  binding sites is displayed in fig. 1. density for
most of the structure was unambiguous with the exception that
residues at the n terminus (amino acid residues 1–19), the c
terminus (410 – 425), and three surface loops (31–36, 158 –167,
and 297–311) were disordered. residues 343–348 have poorly
defined density as observed previously (7, 8) for all t. brucei

odc structures. chain specific differences include the following: chain a has an additional six residues (410 – 414) at the c
terminus, chain c contains density for additional residues at
the n-terminal end (14 –19) and for residue 392, and chain d
has additional density observed for residues 309 –311 and for
the backbone atoms of residues 400 and 401.
in addition to those regions typically disordered in t. brucei
odc crystals, residues val-392 to gln-401, near the active site,
were also disordered in the odc/ xxxg418xxx /d-orn structure (fig. 2).
these residues were well ordered in the previous crystallographic studies of t. brucei odc with b-factors in the region
being comparable with the average b-factor for the overall
structure (7, 8). residues 392– 401 are in the dimer interface,
adjacent to the equivalent loop from the opposing monomer,
and contribute residues that form the back of the active site
pocket (fig. 3a). several of these residues (phe-397, asn-398,
and phe-400) have been demonstrated to be important for
enzyme activity (17, 27). although the space group is the same
as with previous t. brucei odc structures (7, 8), the lattice and
packing differ. neither the inhibitor binding site nor the disordered loop appear to be influenced by the lattice.
the d-orn binding site—this structure allowed for the orientation of the substrate stereoisomer, d-orn, to be determined. d-orn binds odc with a kd of 0.27 mm, similar to the
binding constant for putrescine (8, 28). during kinetic analysis,
d-orn is not decarboxylated at a detectable rate (kcat/km ⬍ 1 ⫻

tion between d-orn and wild-type t. brucei odc required for
crystallization, d-orn is converted to putrescine, as observed in
the odc/put structure (8). in contrast, in the odc/ xxxg418xxx /d-orn
structure, density for the carboxylate is observed (fig. 1a). the
d-orn carboxyl group is positioned on the si face of the plp
cofactor, on the solvent-exposed face of the active site (see fig.
1a and fig. 3b). gly-199, gly-362, and the his-197 side chains
are the only contacts within 4.2 å of the d-orn carboxyl group.
d-orn forms an external aldimine with the plp cofactor, and
the ␦-amino group interacts with asp-361 and asp-332 (fig.
3a). the position for the d-orn ␦-amino group is similar to that
observed for ligands in the putrescine and  xxxd1972xxx  complexed
odc structures (7, 8). lys-69, which forms a schiff base with
plp in the unliganded structure, has rotated out of the active
site to form interactions with asp-88 and glu-94, as observed in
the structure of t. brucei odc bound to putrescine (8).
differences in the active site structure are also observed. in
previous structures residues 158 –165, which are located near
the active site entrance, are disordered. in addition to these
residues, leu-166 becomes disordered in this structure, apparently displaced by the carboxylate of d-orn. cys-360 is also
observed in a different position than for previous ligand-bound
structures (e.g. putrescine or  xxxd1972xxx ). in the putrescine- and
 xxxd1972xxx -bound structures the side chain of cys-360 is rotated in
toward the c␣ carbon of the ligand. in the  xxxg418xxx /d-orn-bound
structure, it is rotated out of the active site pocket (fig. 3),
occupying a similar position to that observed in the native,
uncomplexed structure (7, 8).
the  xxxg418xxx  binding site—electron density for  xxxg418xxx  was observed at the domain interface between the n-terminal
␤/␣⫺barrel and c-terminal ␤⫺sheet (greek key) domain of
individual subunits (see fig. 1b and fig. 2). this binding site is
notably ⬎20 å from the closest active site. electron density is
interpretable for three of the four monomers (a, b, and c) in
the asymmetric unit with the best density observed in the c
monomer. no structural differences are observed between this
region in monomers a, b, and c compared with monomer d,
which could explain why the fourth monomer does not contain
 xxxg418xxx . residues within 4.2 å of  xxxg418xxx  include arg-22, leu-25,
leu-339, pro-340, gln-341, glu-343, leu-382, glu-384, and
asp-385 of the ␤-sheet domain and asp-243 of the ␤/␣-barrel

discussion

the current drug therapy that targets odc ( xxxd1972xxx ) for
treatment of african sleeping sickness is limited by poor pharmacology (2, 29). identification of non-substrate-based inhibitors that bind regions outside of the active site may provide a
means to overcome some of the limitations of  xxxd1972xxx .  xxxg418xxx  was
discovered to be a weak non-competitive inhibitor of t. brucei
odc. although the inhibitor binds too weakly to be considered
a lead compound for drug development, structural analysis of
 xxxg418xxx  bound to odc has provided new insight into the function
of odc. significantly this structure identifies a novel ligand
binding site on odc. the structure was solved in the presence
of d-orn, and the position of a co2 group on this substrateanalog was determined. finally, the  xxxg418xxx -bound structure has
undergone an order-to-disorder transition that has not been
observed previously for odc. the newly identified conformation of t. brucei odc may be of use in development of allosteric
inhibitors of odc.
the position and orientation of substrate in the odc active
site is constrained both by structure and by chemistry. all
three substrate analogs that have been co-crystallized with
odc form a reversible covalent bond (schiff base or aldimine)
with the plp cofactor. the side-chain amino group (n␦) of these
ligands occupies a well conserved binding site, forming an ion
pair with asp-332 and asp-361. these interactions constrain
the orientation of either d- or l-orn in the active site of odc.
further, the role of plp in odc reaction chemistry requires
the leaving group (carboxylate) to be aligned with the pi orbitals of the conjugated imine bond, perpendicular to the plane of
plp for optimal catalysis (30). previous analysis of the putrescine and  xxxd1972xxx -bound odc structures predicted that for the
side chain to bind in the extended conformation necessary to
form close interactions with these key asp residues, the ornithine carboxylate must be positioned on the re face of the

domain (fig. 4). of these residues only pro-340, glu-384, asp385, and asp-243 make h-bonds (3.2 å or better) with the
inhibitor. there are only a few hydrophobic interactions. on
the other hand, several negatively charged residues (noted
above) may offer electrostatic complementarity to the positively
charged  xxxg418xxx .
in an effort to determine whether  xxxg418xxx  inhibition results
from binding to the site observed in the crystal structure, three
residues in the  xxxg418xxx  binding site (asp-243, leu-339, and glu384) were mutated to ala. leu-339 and asp-242 make no observable energetic contribution to  xxxg418xxx  binding. e384a odc
exhibited a small but measurable difference in its inhibition by
 xxxg418xxx  (the ic50 decreased by a factor of 3). the small effect and
the unpredictable direction of the effect are consistent with the
weak inhibition properties of  xxxg418xxx  (data not shown).
comparative analysis of t. brucei odc structures—the
odc/ xxxg418xxx /d-orn structure was compared with the native_odc, odc/put, and k69a_odc/ xxxd1972xxx  t. brucei odc structures. the ␤-sheet domains of the monomers were superimposed, and the average r.m.s.d. of the main-chain atoms was
calculated individually for the ␤/␣-barrel domain and also for
the superimposed ␤-sheet domain. the r.m.s.d. between the
odc/ xxxg418xxx /d-orn structure and the putrescine-bound structure is 2-fold greater than observed between the other structures (table ii). a small domain rotation is observed when
comparing the odc/ xxxg418xxx /d-orn structure with the other three
structures. the most notable rotation (2-3°) is observed between the odc/ xxxg418xxx /d-orn and odc/putrescine structures
(see figs. 4 and 5). this rotation may be the result of inhibitor
binding, but differences in crystallization conditions and lattice contacts are also present that may contribute to this
observation.

cofactor for the l-stereoisomer and the si face for the d-isomer
(7, 8). the t. brucei odc/ xxxg418xxx /d-orn structure is the first odc
structure that has been determined bound to a carboxylated
substrate analog where this hypothesis could be directly assessed (see fig. 1a and fig. 3), and indeed the results confirm
the prediction that the carboxyl group of d-orn is bound on the
solvent-exposed si face of plp.

thus these data, in combination with the constraints imposed on the side-chain position by the active site structure,
strongly suggest that the l-orn stereoisomer binds with the
carboxyl group on the re face of the plp cofactor, facing the
interior of the protein. the mechanism of inactivation of odc
by  xxxd1972xxx  further supports this orientation for substrate. binding of the substrate carboxylate on the re face would position

the ␣-methyl group of  xxxd1972xxx  near cys-360, the known nucleophile in the reaction that generates the covalent enzyme-bound
species, whereas binding in the opposite orientation would
place the reactive group on the other side of the active site from
cys-360 (7). finally, the structure of diaminopimelate decarboxylase, an enzyme from the same fold class as odc, has been
reported recently (32) in complex with product demonstrating a
similar position for the side chain as observed for odc. these
data also support an orientation for the d-stereoisomer substrate that places the carboxylate on the si face of the cofactor.
amino acid decarboxylases are thought to achieve the largest
rate enhancements of any enzyme-catalyzed reaction, increasing the rate by nearly a factor of 1020 (33). for plp-dependent
enzymes a large amount of this rate enhancement is the result
of the catalytic power of the cofactor (factor of 1011); however, a
significant role for the enzyme in promoting the reaction is
clearly required beyond this. the predicted l-co2 binding site
on odc contains both hydrophobic and negatively charged
residues that include phe-397, tyr-389, lys-69 (methylene carbons), and asp-361. notably, in both the ligand-bound struc-

tures, the n␦ of lys-69 is turned away from the predicted
carboxylate binding site, interacting with asp-88 and glu-94.
this would be expected to prevent it from forming stabilizing
interactions with the substrate carboxylate. thus, this model
for co2 binding suggests that the binding pocket would enhance decarboxylation by forming more favorable interactions
with the more neutral transition state structure (co2) than the
charged ground state structure (co2⫺). supporting the hypothesis that the l-co2 binding site includes phe-397, steady-state
and pre-steady-state analysis of the phe-397 to ala mutant
odc demonstrated a reduced rate for the decarboxylation step
(27).
the carboxylate binding sites of a number of decarboxylases
from diverse structural classes also contain hydrophobic and
negatively charged residues. chalcone synthase-like enzymes
have a conserved phe positioned in the carboxylate binding site
that is hypothesized to facilitate decarboxylation (31). structural analysis of pyruvoyl-dependent  xxxg1040xxx 
(34) demonstrated that the carboxylate binding site is formed
by hydrophobic and negatively charged residues. the carboxylate binding site of orotodine-5⬘-phosphate decarboxylase also
contains a negative charge in close proximity of the carboxylate
binding site. however controversy over the role of this residue
exists. although it has been suggested that this residue promotes decarboxylation by ground-state destabilization, it appears likely that the major driving force for the reaction is
transition state stabilization by other residues in the active site
(33).
the position of cys-360 in the d-orn complex suggests that
mechanism-related conformational changes may also be important to drive the reaction chemistry (fig. 3a). in this structure,
the cys is rotated out of the active site, similar to native odc
(7, 9, 36). model building suggests that with l-orn bound,
cys-360 would also be rotated out of the active site because of
steric clashes with the substrate carboxyl group. in contrast, in
product complexes the cys is rotated into the active site (7, 8).
this suggests that cys-360 rotates during the reaction cycle
from an external to an internal position, which could be important to prevent proton abstraction prior to decarboxylation.
following decarboxylation, rotation of cys-360 would position
it to serve as a general acid to protonate c␣, a required step in
the reaction. in support, mutation of cys-360 reduces the rate
of the decarboxylation step and causes improper protonation to
occur at the c4⬘ position of plp, leading to product deamination (8).
the  xxxg418xxx  binding-site at the junction between the ␤-sheet
and ␤/␣-barrel domains (fig. 2) is consistent with the noncompetitive kinetics observed for inhibition of odc by  xxxg418xxx .
two conformational changes are observed in this structure

conclusion

the odc/ xxxg418xxx /d-orn x-ray crystal structure reported provides experimental evidence for the orientation of a carboxylated substrate analogue (d-orn). the position of the d-orn
carboxyl group supports a model where the l-orn carboxylate
is buried in the odc active site on the re face of plp in a
largely hydrophobic pocket that is predicted to bind the neutral
transition state structure with better affinity than the charged
ground state, thereby promoting decarboxylation.  xxxg418xxx  is a
weak non-competitive inhibitor of odc. the x-ray structure
has located a binding site for  xxxg418xxx  in the domain boundary,
and the observed structural changes provide a possible mechanism for allosteric regulation of odc. significantly, an orderto-disorder transition of a loop region at the dimer interface
containing residues from the active site was observed.

relative to previously published odc structures. first, superposition of monomers from different structures reveals that the
␤/␣-barrel and ␤-sheet domains in the odc/ xxxg418xxx /d-orn structure have undergone a small domain rotation, when compared
with previously published t. brucei odc structures (see figs.
4 and 5). second, no defined density is observed in this structure for ten amino acids that had previously been found to be
well ordered in all eukaryotic odc structures published to
date. these amino acid residues (392– 401) form a loop that
interacts along the dimer interface with the corresponding loop
from the opposing monomer and that contributes residues that
form the back of the active site pocket (see fig. 2 and fig. 3a).
several of the loop residues have been demonstrated to be
essential for enzyme activity, including phe-397, asn-398, and
phe-400 (17). thus the disordering of this loop region upon
 xxxg418xxx  binding provides a mechanism for enzyme inhibition
despite the large distance between the active site and the  xxxg418xxx 
binding site. these results show that different conformers of
odc are available at low energy and suggest a mechanism by
which odc can be inhibited allosterically by binding ligands to
the domain interface.
mammalian cells produce a protein inhibitor of odc termed
the antizyme (az), which is a regulatory protein synthesized in
response to high polyamine levels (reviewed in refs. 35 and 36).
az binds odc distant from the active site, inhibiting activity
and targeting odc for degradation. the binding of az to odc
increases the reactivity of antibodies raised to sequences
within the c terminus (residues 376 to 461) of mouse odc,
suggesting that the c terminus becomes more accessible in the
presence of az (22). although az does not bind to the same site
as  xxxg418xxx  (fig. 2), an interesting question is whether its binding
could cause similar structural changes to those observed in the
presence of  xxxg418xxx , namely the disorder of the 392-401 loop region.
