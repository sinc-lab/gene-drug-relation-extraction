abstract
 xxxd3122xxx  and etravirine are second generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
approved recently by the united states food and drug administration for the treatment of
human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection.  xxxg1598xxx  ( xxxg1598xxx ) is a member of the
superfamily of nuclear receptors that regulate the expression of various genes controlling diverse
biological functions. the present study investigated the effects of  xxxd3122xxx  and etravirine on
the activity of human  xxxg1598xxx  (hpxr), including the mode of activation, and compared them to
those of efavirenz, nevirapine, and delavirdine, which are first generation non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors.

in transiently transfected hepg2 cells,  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and

efavirenz, but not nevirapine or delavirdine, activated human, mouse, and rat  xxxg1598xxx . results from
mechanistic studies indicated that  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and efavirenz, but not nevirapine or
delavirdine, bound to the ligand-binding domain of hpxr, as assessed by a transactivation assay
and by a competitive ligand-binding assay using time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy
transfer; triggered nuclear translocation of a green fluorescence protein-tagged hpxr, as
visualized by confocal imaging; and recruited  xxxg1510xxx  ( xxxg1510xxx ), src-2,
and  xxxg1512xxx  to hpxr, as demonstrated by mammalian two-hybrid assays.  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine,
and efavirenz, but not nevirapine or delavirdine, increased hpxr target gene (cyp3a4)
expression in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. in summary, select non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors activated human and rodent  xxxg1598xxx .  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and efavirenz,
but not nevirapine or delavirdine, were identified as agonists of hpxr, as assessed in
mechanistic experiments, and inducers of cyp3a4, as determined in primary cultures of human
hepatocytes.

1. introduction
human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (hiv/aids) still
remains one of the leading causes of mortality in humans, claiming an estimated 1.8 million lives
annually [1]. unfortunately, a cure for this disease has not been found yet; however, the current
therapeutic options are able to suppress viral load and increase cluster of differentiation 4 (cd4)
counts in hiv/aids patients [2]. an important class of drugs that is routinely used for the
treatment of hiv-1 infection, along with other anti-retroviral drugs, is the non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors [3]. efavirenz, nevirapine, and delavirdine (fig. 1) are first generation
non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors approved for clinical use by the united states
food and drug administration (u.s. fda). the most recent additions to this drug class are
 xxxd3122xxx  and etravirine (fig 1), which were approved for clinical use by the u.s. fda in may
2011 [4] and january 2008 [5], respectively.  xxxd3122xxx  and etravirine, like other non-nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors, inhibit hiv-1 reverse transcriptase enzyme allosterically [5].
they are potent second generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. a therapeutic
option is to use  xxxd3122xxx  in combination with other anti-retrovirals. recently, the u.s. fda
approved a  xxxd3122xxx -based triple drug combination with the brand names of  xxxd3122xxx ®
(containing 25 mg  xxxd3122xxx , 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil, and 200 mg emtricitabine; available
in the u.s.a.) and eviplera® (containing 25 mg  xxxd3122xxx , 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil, and 200
mg emtricitabine; available in the european union) for the treatment of hiv-1 infection [4].
like  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine is reported to be effective in both non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitor-naive and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistant strains of hiv-1, and
it is used in combination with other anti-retrovirals [6].

nuclear receptors represent a broad group of ligand-activated transcriptional factors and
are categorized as endocrine receptors, adopted orphan receptors, and orphan receptors [7]. they
play a key regulatory role in various biological processes, ranging from development and
differentiation to metabolic homeostasis.  xxxg1598xxx  ( xxxg1598xxx ; designated as  xxxg1598xxx 
according to the nomenclature of nuclear receptors) is a member of the superfamily of nuclear
receptors [8]. it acts as xenobiotic sensors and regulates expression of genes involved in drug
transport, such as  xxxg10xxx  (p-glycoprotein) [9] and  xxxg15xxx  ( xxxg15xxx ) [10], and those involved in
drug metabolism, such as cyp3a4 [11-13]. other than playing a major role in many of the
pharmacokinetic drug interactions [14],  xxxg1598xxx  has been linked to the development of bile acid
toxicity [15], drug-induced hepatotoxicity [16], and anticancer drug resistance [17]. it has also
been proposed as a therapeutic target for various disease states, including cholestatic liver
disease [18], inflammatory bowel disease [19], and dyslipidemia [20].
among the first generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, efavirenz has
been reported to activate human  xxxg1598xxx  (hpxr) [21-23]. by comparison, nevirapine only weakly
activates hpxr, and this occurs not at a therapeutic concentration (7.5 µm) [23], but at a
suprapharmacological concentration (50 µm) [22]. however, the mechanism on how these
drugs activate hpxr is still not known. in a recent study, treatment of primary cultures of
human hepatocytes with etravirine (10 µm) increased cyp3a4 mrna expression [24]. this
increase in cyp3a4 mrna expression by etravirine was attenuated by pretreatment with
sulforaphane [24], which is an in vitro antagonist of hpxr [25]. however, there is no direct
experimental evidence as to whether the second generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors (i.e.  xxxd3122xxx  and etravirine) affect the transcriptional activity of  xxxg1598xxx  or how they
may activate hpxr.

in the present study, we systematically evaluated the effects of  xxxd3122xxx  and etravirine
on the activity of hpxr, including their mode of activation, and compared them to those of first
generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors; i.e., efavirenz, nevirapine, and
delavirdine. given that  xxxg1598xxx  is known to show pronounced species-dependent activation by
drugs and other chemicals [26], we determined whether  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and other nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors activate mouse  xxxg1598xxx  (mpxr) and rat  xxxg1598xxx  (rpxr).
our experimental approaches involved cell-based luciferase reporter gene assays, competitive
ligand binding assay by time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (tr-fret), in
vitro nuclear translocation analysis by confocal microscopy, mammalian two-hybrid assay, and
hpxr target gene (cyp3a4) expression analysis in human hepatocytes in culture. the results
are discussed in the context of drug-dependent activation of human and rodent  xxxg1598xxx  by select
non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and their mode of activation.

inhibitor ( xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, efavirenz, nevirapine, or delavirdine), a negative control, or a
positive control at the concentrations indicated in the appropriate figure legend. at the end of
the 24 h treatment period, hepg2 cells were lysed. firefly luciferase and renilla reniformis
luciferase activities were quantified using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (promega).
luminescence was measured in a glomax 96 microplate luminometer (promega). normalized
luciferase activity was determined by calculating the ratio of firefly luciferase activity and r.
reniformis luciferase activity. background luciferase activity was determined in hepg2 cells
transfected with the corresponding empty vector. results are expressed as fold increase over the
vehicle-treated control group. each experiment was performed in triplicate and a total of three

(0.1% v/v; vehicle control), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( xxxd3122xxx ,
etravirine, efavirenz, nevirapine, or delavirdine; 5 µm), pcn (10 µm; negative control for
hpxr) [26], or rifampin (10 µm; positive control for hpxr [13]) for 24 h. subsequently, the
cells were fixed with p-formaldehyde (4% v/v) for 20 min on ice. after three washes in
phosphate-buffered saline (ph 7.4), the cover slips containing cells were mounted on glass slides
using prolong® gold antifade reagent with dapi.

the cells were visualized under an

olympus fv10i confocal microscope interfaced with the fluoview 10i software (fv10i version
1.2c) and analyzed using the nih, imagej software (national institutes of health, u.s.a.).

2.9. mammalian two-hybrid assay
recruitment of  xxxg1510xxx  ( xxxg1510xxx ), steroid receptor coactivator-2

 xxxg2040xxx .74 [hrluc/tk] internal control vector (10 ng/well), pfr-luc reporter plasmid (100
ng/well), a coactivator expression plasmid (10 ng/well), and either pvp16-hpxr-lbd
expression plasmid or the corresponding pvp16 empty vector (40 ng/well). the coactivator
expression plasmids were pm-hsrc1-rid, pm-hsrc2-rid, and pm-hsrc3-rid. at 24 h
post-transfection, cells were treated with supplemented culture medium containing dmso (0.1%
v/v; vehicle control), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( xxxd3122xxx , etravirine,
efavirenz, nevirapine, or delavirdine; 5 µm), pcn (10 µm; negative control for hpxr), rifampin
(10 µm; positive control for hpxr), or  xxxd1380xxx  (10 µm; positive control for hpxr) for 24 h.

luciferase activity was measured and normalized as described under transient transfection and
reporter gene assays.

each experiment was performed in triplicate and a total of five

independent experiments were conducted.

2.10. culture and treatment of human hepatocytes
the demographics of the donors (gc4008 and hum4021) are listed in table 1.
cryopreserved human hepatocytes (triangle research labs, llc, research triangle park, nc,
u.s.a.)

were

thawed

and

plated

according

to

protocols

listed

at

http://triangleresearchlabs.net/products/cryopreserved-hepatocytes/. cell viability was 88% and
90% for hepatocyte samples gc4008 and hum4021, respectively, as assessed by trypan blue
exclusion [31]. hepatocytes were plated and cultured at a density of 3.5 × 105 cells per well in a
biocoat 24-well plate at 37°c in a humidified incubator with 95% air and 5% co2. they were
allowed to attach for 4 to 6 h. subsequently, the medium was aspirated and 0.5 ml of fresh
hepatocyte maintenance medium (triangle research labs, llc, research triangle park, nc,
u.s.a.) and matrigel (0.25 mg/ml) were added to each well. plates were placed in the incubator,
and this was followed by a change in the culture medium on day 2 and drug treatment was
initiated on day 3. cultured hepatocytes were treated with hepatocyte maintenance medium
containing dmso (0.1% v/v; vehicle control), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
( xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, efavirenz, nevirapine, or delavirdine; 5 µm), or rifampin (10 µm; positive
control for cyp3a4 expression [32]), as described in the figure legend. the drug-containing
culture medium was replaced every 24 h and the treatment was continued for 48 h for hepatocyte
sample gc4008 and 72 h for hepatocyte sample hum4021.

2.11. isolation of total rna, reverse transcription, and real-time pcr analysis
rna isolation and reverse transcription were conducted as described previously [28].
briefly, cultured human hepatocytes were lysed and total cellular rna was isolated using
purelink rna mini kit (life technologies, burlington, on, canada). total rna was reversetranscribed using superscript ii reverse transcriptase, and total cdna was quantified using
picogreen double-stranded dna quantitation kit (life technologies, burlington, on,
canada).
the sequences of the primers used to amplify cyp3a4 cdna [33] and  xxxg1075xxx  cdna
[34] were specified in our previous publication [28]. the sequence of the forward primer to
amplify the cdna of 18s rrna was 5-ctt-tgg-tcg-ctc-gct-cct-c-3, whereas the
sequence of the reverse primer was 5-ctg-acc-ggg-ttg-gtt-ttg-at-3. the primers
were synthesized and their specificity was verified by sequencing the purified amplicons
(integrated dna technologies, inc., coralville, ia, u.s.a.).
cyp3a4 cdna and  xxxg1075xxx  cdna were amplified by real-time pcr in a lighcycler
(roche diagnostics, laval, qc, canada) according to conditions described previously [28]. to
amplify the cdna of 18s rrna, each pcr reaction contained 1 ng total cdna, 1 u platinum
taq dna polymerase in 1 pcr buffer (20 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.4 and 50 mm kcl), 3 mm
mgcl2, 0.2 mm deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 0.25 mg/ml bovine  xxxg124xxx , 0.2 m
forward and reverse primers, and 1:30,000 sybr green i. the pcr cycling conditions were
95oc for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95oc for 1 s, 62oc for 6 s, and 72oc for 10 s. to
construct calibration curves (cross point versus log cdna copies), cyp3a4,  xxxg1075xxx , and 18s
rrna amplicons were generated from human liver quick-clone cdna (clontech, mountain

view, ca, u.s.a.) and then purified and quantified as described previously [35]. cyp3a4
mrna expression was normalized to that of housekeeping genes ( xxxg1075xxx  and 18s rrna).

2.12. testosterone  xxxd1946xxx -hydroxylation assay
testosterone  xxxd1946xxx -hydroxylation assay was conducted in cultured human hepatocytes as
described previously [28]. briefly, cultured human hepatocytes were first washed twice with
hbss and subsequently incubated with testosterone (200 µm final concentration) for 15 min at
37°c. the incubation samples were then transferred to a 24-well plate and stored at -80°c until
analysis. high-performance liquid chromatographic (hplc) analyses of  xxxd1946xxx -hydroxytestosterone
was performed as described previously [35], but with several modifications. in the present
study, 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one (in acetonitrile) was selected as the internal standard based on its
structural similarity to the analyte ( xxxd1946xxx -hydroxytestosterone), and 10 µl of the internal standard
(2000 pmol) was added to 150 µl of the hepatocytes incubation sample. a 50 µl of that sample
was injected onto the hplc.

the detector response of the internal standard was used to

normalize the detector response of  xxxd1946xxx -hydroxytestosterone. the hplc system (waters, milford,
ma, u.s.a.) was equipped with a waters model 1525 binary pump, waters model 717 plus
autosampler, and waters model 2487 dual wavelength absorbance detector.

the

chromatographic separation was carried out on a waters symmetryshield c18 column (150 x 4.6
mm; i.d., 5 µm) linked to a phenomenex (torrance, ca, u.s.a.) securityguard cartridge (4.0 x
3.0 mm; i.d., 5 µm). the mobile phases consisted of water containing 0.5% v/v acetic acid (a)
and methanol containing 0.5% v/v acetic acid (b), and the optimized flow rate was 0.8 ml/min.

(0-12 min), isocratic at 90% b (12-15 min), linear gradient from 90 to 55% b (15-16 min), and
isocratic at 55% b (16-25 min). the detector response for  xxxd1946xxx -hydroxytestosterone and internal
standard was recorded at a wavelength of 242 nm.

data acquisition and processing were

conducted using the waters breeze software (version 3.20). a calibration curve was constructed
with the authentic  xxxd1946xxx -hydroxytestosterone standard (100-12,500 pmol; diluted in hbss) for each
experiment.

2.13. data analyses
the half-maximal effective concentration (ec50) and maximal response (emax) for hpxr
activation were calculated using the following equation in graphpad prism® 5.00 (graphpad
software, inc., la jolla, ca, u.s.a.): e = e0 + (emax – e0) / (1+10 (log ec50- c)), where e is effect
(i.e. fold increase over vehicle-treated control group), e0 is basal effect, and c is drug
concentration. data analyses were performed by one-way or two-way analysis of variance.
where appropriate, two-way analysis of variance was followed by the student newman-keuls
multiple comparison test (sigmaplot 11.0; systat software, inc., san jose, ca, u.s.a.). the
level of statistical significance was set a priori at p < 0.05.

3.1. cytotoxicity assessment of  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and other non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors
to determine non-cytotoxic concentrations of the selected non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors for investigation in the subsequent in vitro cell-based reporter gene
assays, release of intracellular ldh into the culture medium was employed as a cytotoxicity
marker [31].

ldh release was quantified in cultured hepg2 cells treated with increasing

concentrations (0.1-25 µm) of  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, efavirenz, nevirapine, or delavirdine. ldh
release did not increase at drug concentrations of up to 10 µm for  xxxd3122xxx  (fig. 2a), etravirine
(fig. 2b), efavirenz (fig. 2c), nevirapine (fig. 2d), or delavirdine (fig. 2e). expected results
were obtained for the positive control (0.1% v/v triton x-100; fig 2a-2e) and the negative
control (1% w/v dextran; fig. 2a-2e). in all subsequent experiments, the concentration of the
non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors did not exceed 10 µm.

3.2.  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and efavirenz, but not nevirapine or delavirdine, activate hpxr
the effect of  xxxd3122xxx  and etravirine on the activity of hpxr was assessed in cell-based
reporter gene assays and compared with an equimolar concentration (5 µm) of efavirenz,
nevirapine, and delavirdine in hpxr-transfected hepg2 cells. as shown in fig. 3a,  xxxd3122xxx 
and etravirine increased hpxr activity by 11- and 17-fold, respectively, over the vehicle-treated
control group. among the other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors tested, efavirenz
(7-fold), but not nevirapine or delavirdine, activated hpxr. rifampin (10 µm), a positive

16
page 16 of 50

(clean copy)
control for hpxr activation [13], produced a 20-fold increase over the vehicle-treated control
group, whereas pcn (10 µm), a negative control [26], did not have an effect.

3.3. concentration-response relationship in the effect of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors on hpxr activity
concentration-response experiments were performed to further characterize the activation
of hpxr by  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and efavirenz.

as shown in fig. 3b,  xxxd3122xxx , at

concentrations of 0.05 and 0.1 µm, had no effect on the activity of hpxr, whereas it activated
hpxr at greater concentrations (0.5-10 µm), with a maximal response of 11-fold produced at 5
µm. etravirine had a profile similar to  xxxd3122xxx  as 0.05 and 0.1 µm had no effect on hpxr
activity, whereas greater concentrations (0.5-10 µm) of this drug activated hpxr, with maximal
response (17-fold) produced at 5 µm. efavirenz at a concentration of 0.5 or 1 µm had no effect
on hpxr activity, whereas at 5 and 10 µm, it increased the activity by 7- and 10-fold,
respectively.

in contrast to  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine and efavirenz, neither nevirapine nor

delavirdine activated hpxr at concentrations up to and including 10 µm (fig. 3b).
the calculated ec50 and emax values (mean ± s.e.m.) for  xxxd3122xxx -mediated hpxr
activation were 0.4 ± 0.2 µm and 11 ± 1 fold, respectively, whereas those for hpxr activation
by etravirine were 0.6 ± 0.1 µm and 17 ± 1 fold, respectively. these values are comparable with
the literature ec50 and emax values for hpxr activation by rifampin [36], which is a prototypic
hpxr agonist [13]. it was not possible to calculate the ec50 and emax values for efavirenz
because maximal effect was not achieved in our dose-response experiment (fig. 3b).

3.4.  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and efavirenz, but not nevirapine or delavirdine, activate mpxr and
rpxr
pronounced species-dependent chemical activation of  xxxg1598xxx  has been reported [26].
therefore, we determined the effect of the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (figs.
3a and 3b) on the activity of mpxr and rpxr.  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and efavirenz, but not
nevirapine or delavirdine, activated mpxr (fig. 4a) and rpxr (fig. 4b). this pattern of
response is similar to the profile shown for hpxr (fig. 3a). pcn (10 µm), which is a positive
control for ligand activation of mpxr and rpxr [37], activated both mpxr and rpxr, whereas
rifampin (10 µm), which is a negative control [37], had no effect (fig. 4a and 4b).

3.5.  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and efavirenz, but not nevirapine or delavirdine, transactivate the
ligand-binding domain of hpxr
to investigate whether  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and efavirenz act as agonists of hpxr, a
series of mechanistic experiments were performed, starting with a cell-based reporter gene assay
whereby hepg2 cells were transfected with a plasmid (i.e. pm-hpxr-lbd; met-107 to ser-434)
expressing the ligand-binding domain of hpxr. as shown in fig. 5a,  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and
efavirenz produced a 4.8-, 6.4-, and 3.5-fold increase in the luciferase activity, respectively. as
expected, nevirapine and delavirdine had no effect on the transactivation of hpxr-lbd,
consistent with data shown in a reporter gene assay using the full-length hpxr (fig. 3a and 3b).
the positive controls (10 µm rifampin and 10 µm  xxxd1380xxx ) and the negative control (10 µm)
produced the expected results (fig. 5a).

3.6. tr-fret analyses indicate binding of  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and efavirenz to the ligandbinding domain of hpxr
to corroborate the hpxr-lbd transactivation data (fig. 5a), a tr-fret competitive
ligand-binding assay was conducted. as shown in fig. 5b,  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and efavirenz
(each at 5 µm) decreased the net tr-fret emission ratio to 48%, 58%, and 72% of the control
level, respectively, whereas nevirapine and delavirdine had no effect. analyses with positive
controls indicate that phenobarbital (1000 µm) produced an effect (61% of the control level)
comparable to that of  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and efavirenz, whereas  xxxd1380xxx  (10 µm) was the
most effective (< 1% of the control level). the negative control (10 µm pcn) yielded the
expected result.

3.7.  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and efavirenz, but not nevirapine or delavirdine, stimulate nuclear
translocation of gfp-tagged hpxr
in its inactive form, hpxr resides mainly in the cytoplasmic compartment of the cells,
and upon activation by an agonist, the agonist-activated receptor complex translocates from the
cytoplasm into the nucleus [38]. according to confocal microscopy (fig. 6), the gfp-tagged
hpxr translocated to the nucleus in hepg2 cells treated with  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, or efavirenz,
as evident by the predominant localization of green fluorescence in the nucleus. a similar
finding was obtained in cells treated with the positive control rifampin, in agreement with
published data [39]. in contrast, the fluorescence was predominantly in the cytoplasm in gfphpxr-transfected cells treated with nevirapine, delavirdine, or pcn (negative control).

3.8.  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and efavirenz, but not nevirapine or delavirdine, promote recruitment
of coactivators to hpxr
to assess whether  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and efavirenz recruit coactivators to hpxr,
mammalian two-hybrid assays were conducted.  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and efavirenz, but not
nevirapine or delavirdine, increased the luciferase reporter activity in hepg2 cells transfected
with pvp16-hpxr-lbd and a coactivator expression plasmid for  xxxg1510xxx  (fig. 7a), src-2 (fig.
7b), or  xxxg1512xxx  (fig. 7c). experiments with the positive controls (10 µm rifampin and 10 µm
 xxxd1380xxx ) and negative control (10 µm pcn) yielded the expected results (fig. 7a-7c).

3.9.  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and efavirenz, but not nevirapine or delavirdine, increase the
expression of a hpxr target gene (cyp3a4) in cultured human hepatocytes
primary cultures of human hepatocytes were used to compare the effect of first and
second generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors on the induction of cyp3a4,
which is a known target gene of hpxr [11-13]. in sample gc4008 (fig. 8a),  xxxd3122xxx ,
etravirine, and efavirenz increased cyp3a4 mrna expression by 5.7-, 4.3-, and 1.8-fold,
respectively, whereas nevirapine and delavirdine had no effect. a similar trend was observed in
sample hum4021 where  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and efavirenz increased cyp3a4 mrna
expression by 3.1-, 6.3-, and 1.7-fold, respectively, and nevirapine and delavirdine had no effect
(fig. 8b). by comparison, rifampin (10 µm; positive control) increased the expression of
cyp3a4 mrna by 3.8-fold in sample gc4008 and 4.8-fold in sample hum4021. the same
overall pattern of response was obtained regardless of whether  xxxg1075xxx  (figs. 8a and 8b) or 18s
rrna (data not shown) was used as the reference gene to normalize the cyp3a4 mrna data.

hydroxytestosterone [40], was also measured. in sample gc4008, etravirine and efavirenz
increased  xxxg590xxx  catalytic activity by 2.5- and 2.8-fold, respectively (fig. 8c), whereas
 xxxd3122xxx  and delavirdine decreased it and nevirapine had no effect. by comparison, in sample
hum4021,  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and efavirenz increased  xxxg590xxx  catalytic activity by 3.1-, 3.9-,
and 3.2-fold, respectively (fig. 8d), whereas delavirdine decreased it and nevirapine had no
effect. in the same experiment, rifampin increased  xxxg590xxx  activity by 8.7- and 4.1-fold in
samples gc4008 and hum4021, respectively.

discussion
 xxxg1598xxx  is a ligand-activated transcriptional factor belonging to the superfamily of nuclear

receptors [8] and it is known to regulate the expression of biologically important genes [20]. we
report for the first time that the second generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
 xxxd3122xxx  and etravirine act as orthosteric agonists of hpxr. this conclusion is based on the
experimental evidence indicating that both  xxxd3122xxx  and etravirine 1) bound to the ligandbinding domain of hpxr, as demonstrated by hpxr-lbd transactivation and tr-fret
competitive ligand-binding assay; 2) stimulated nuclear translocation of gfp-tagged hpxr into
the nuclear compartment, as shown by confocal microscopy; and 3) recruited steroid receptor
coactivators  xxxg1510xxx , src-2, and  xxxg1512xxx  to hpxr, as indicated by mammalian two-hybrid assays.
our concentration-response data indicated that  xxxd3122xxx  and etravirine activated hpxr at a
concentration range of 0.5-10 µm, with maximal effect observed at 5 µm. as a comparison, the
steady-state maximum plasma concentrations of  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and efavirenz have been
reported to be 0.30 ± 0.08 µm (mean ± s.d.) [41], 1.81 ± 0.66 µm (mean ± s.d.) [42], and 12.98
µm (95% confidence interval, 7.95-18.27 µm) [43], respectively, in specific studies conducted
in hiv patients. overall, our data show that  xxxd3122xxx  and etravirine activate hpxr at low
micromolar concentrations and by a mechanism that involves orthosteric agonism of the
receptor.
comparison of  xxxd3122xxx  and etravirine with the first generation non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors, such as efavirenz, nevirapine and delavirdine, revealed drug-specific
agonism of hpxr by this class of anti-hiv drugs, as demonstrated by the mechanistic
experiments in the present study. among the five drugs investigated, only  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine,
and efavirenz, but not nevirapine or delavirdine, were identified as agonists of hpxr. at an

22
page 22 of 50

(clean copy)
equimolar concentration (5 µm), the rank order in the activation of hpxr was etravirine >
 xxxd3122xxx  > efavirenz, based on data from our cell-based reporter gene assay. by comparison, as
shown in the present study, nevirapine did not activate hpxr at ≤ 10 µm, in agreement with a
previous study reporting a lack of an effect  xxxd2274xxx .5 µm [23]. this drug weakly activates hpxr at
a concentration of 50 µm [22]. overall, it is interesting that despite the chemical diversity
within the first and second generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [5], three
out of the five drugs investigated are capable of activating hpxr. this not only points to the
well-known broad substrate specificity of hpxr [44], but it also provides an opportunity to
utilize this information to deduce the structure-activity relationship for newer non-nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors that may be valuable in designing newer drugs in this class.
 xxxg1598xxx  has been reported to show remarkable species-dependent differences in the ligandbinding domain [26]. illustrating this fact are the examples of rifampin and pcn. rifampin is a
well-known activator of hpxr, but it has no activity on mpxr or rpxr [37]. in contrast, pcn
activates mpxr and rpxr, but not hpxr [37]. as assessed at an equimolar concentration (5
m) in the present study,  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and efavirenz, but not nevirapine or delavirdine,
activated mpxr and rpxr, a profile that is qualitatively similar to that obtained in our hpxr
activation experiment. according to site-directed mutagenesis studies, leu-308 [45] and gln285 [46] in the ligand-binding domain of hpxr, ile-282 in the ligand-binding domain of mpxr
[46], and phe-305 and asp-318 in the ligand-binding domain of rpxr [47] were identified as
amino acids imparting ligand-dependent species-specific activation of  xxxg1598xxx . future in silico
docking studies, including those that target these specific amino acid residues, may provide
insights into the binding pattern of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in the ligandbinding domain of hpxr, mpxr, and rpxr, and the lack of species-dependent  xxxg1598xxx  activation

23
page 23 of 50

(clean copy)
by this class of anti-hiv drugs. overall, our data suggest that it may be appropriate to utilize
mouse and rat models to assess the biological interactions between hpxr and the non-nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors  xxxd3122xxx , etravarine, and efavirenz.
as shown in our experiment with human hepatocytes in culture, agonism of hpxr by
 xxxd3122xxx  was associated with an increase in the mrna expression of cyp3a4, which is a target
gene of hpxr [11-13]. the increase was accompanied by an elevation in  xxxg590xxx -mediated
testosterone  xxxd1946xxx -hydroxylation activity in hepatocyte sample hum4021 (fig. 8d), but a decrease
in sample gc4008 (fig 8c).

the reason for this differential finding in testosterone  xxxd1946xxx -

hydroxylation activity is not clear, but perhaps  xxxd3122xxx  elicits a non-genomic effect (e.g.
mechanism-based inactivation) that dominates over the genomic effect (i.e. transcriptional
increase in cyp3a4 gene expression) and accounts for the net decrease in testosterone 6betahydroxylation that occurs after 2 days of drug treatment (fig. 8c). studies are planned to
explore this possibility. the reported induction of  xxxg590xxx  enzymes by etravirine ([24] and
present study) and efavirenz [21-23;48,49] in cultured human hepatocytes also occurs in vivo in
humans, as inferred from pharmacokinetic studies. the administration of etravirine decreases
the area under the plasma concentration-time profile for  xxxd2542xxx  [50], which is metabolized
almost exclusively by  xxxg590xxx  enzymes [51]. similarly, human pharmacokinetic studies have
shown that efavirenz increases the elimination of  xxxg590xxx  substrates, as assessed by the
erythromycin breath test [52], the metabolic formation of omeprazole sulfone from omeprazole
[53], and the metabolic formation of 4beta-hydroxycholesterol from cholesterol [54]. the lack of
cyp3a4 induction by nevirapine at ≤ 10 µm in cultured human hepatocytes ([23] and present
study) is consistent with a lack of an effect of therapeutic doses of this drug on  xxxg590xxx  activity
in vivo, as determined by the erythromycin breath test [55]. in the case of delavirdine at a

24
page 24 of 50

(clean copy)
concentration of ≤ 10 µm, this drug did not activate hpxr or increase cyp3a4 gene expression;
rather, in our cultured human hepatocyte experiment, it decreased  xxxg590xxx -mediated testosterone
 xxxd1946xxx -hydroxylation, consistent with the identification of delavirdine as a  xxxg590xxx  inhibitor in vivo
in human subjects [56] and a  xxxg590xxx  mechanism-based inactivator in vitro in microsomal
incubations [57]. overall, given that  xxxg1598xxx  plays a major role in regulating the expression of
genes involved not only in drug transport and metabolism, but also in other biological processes
[20], it will be important to assess the effects of  xxxd3122xxx  and etravirine on the expression of
hpxr target genes other than cyp3a4. studies are currently underway to investigate in detail
the functional consequences of hpxr activation by the second generation non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors.
in summary, among the five non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors investigated
in the present study,  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and efavirenz, but not nevirapine or delavirdine, are
activators of hpxr, mpxr, and rpxr.

agonism of hpxr by  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and

efavirenz was demonstrated by the ability of these drugs to bind to the ligand binding domain of
hpxr, promote nuclear translocation of gfp-tagged hpxr, and recruit receptor coactivators
( xxxg1510xxx , src-2, and  xxxg1512xxx ). hpxr activation by  xxxd3122xxx , etravirine, and efavirenz was
associated with induction of a hpxr target gene (cyp3a4). overall, our novel findings indicate
ligand-dependent regulation of  xxxg1598xxx  function by select non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors and provide insight into the molecular mechanism of hpxr activation by  xxxd3122xxx ,
etravirine, and efavirenz. as activation of  xxxg1598xxx  and induction of target gene expression form the
molecular basis of drug-drug interactions [14] and other biological actions [20], the results from
the present study provide a rational basis for investigating novel actions of the second generation
non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors  xxxd3122xxx  and etravirine.
