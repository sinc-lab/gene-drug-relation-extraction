common resistance mechanisms to deoxynucleoside analogues in variants of the human erythroleukaemic line k562.  resistant variants of the human leukaemic line k562 were developed using selection with the deoxynucleoside analogues  xxxd1790xxx ,  xxxd1712xxx ,  xxxd2120xxx  and gemcitabine. the resistant lines displayed a high degree of cross resistance to all deoxynucleoside analogues, with little or no cross resistance to other agents. there was a profound accumulation defect of all nucleoside analogues in the resistant variants but no significant defect in nucleoside transport in any of the variants. 5' nucleotidase activity was strongly increased and  xxxg611xxx  activity was moderately reduced in all of the resistant variants, resulting in reduced accumulation of triphosphate analogues. in addition a deletion in one of the alleles of the  xxxg611xxx  was detected in the  xxxd2120xxx -resistant line. ribonucleotide reductase activity was found to be strongly increased in the gemcitabine-selected line and  xxxg1792xxx  was increased in the  xxxd1712xxx -selected line. free nucleotide pools were increased in the  xxxd1712xxx -selected line. there was no expression of the  xxxg10xxx  gene by the resistant lines. karyotypic analysis and fish experiments using a 6q21 specific probe showed alterations in the 6(q16-q22) region which contains the 5'-nucleotidase gene. early events in the activation and degradation of deoxynucleoside analogues appear to constitute common mechanisms of resistance to these compounds.
