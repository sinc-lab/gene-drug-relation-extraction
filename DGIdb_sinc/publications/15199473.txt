aspirin acetylates serine-530 of  xxxg1883xxx  (cox-1), thereby blocking
thromboxane a2 synthesis in platelets and reducing platelet aggregation. this mechanism
of action accounts for the effect of aspirin on prevention of coronary artery and cerebrovascular thrombosis. aspirin is less effective in inhibiting cox-2 activity, whereas
celecoxib and rofecoxib selectively inhibit cox-2 activity as they contain a side chain to
anchor to the side pocket of cox-2 substrate channel. aspirin and salicylate at therapeutic concentrations inhibit cox-2 protein expression through interference with binding
of ccaat/enhancer binding protein  (c/ebp) to its cognate site on cox-2 promoter/enhancer. expression of other genes, such as  xxxg1578xxx  and
 xxxd3054xxx , may be inhibited by aspirin and salicylate by a c/ebp-dependent mechanism. aspirin at suprapharmacological concentrations inhibits nf-b-mediated gene
transcription and protects tissue from injury. these recent studies provide new insight
into the pharmacological actions of aspirin and salicylate preparations and implicate
c/ebp as a potential target for therapy of inflammation and tissue injury.

educational objectives: upon completion of this article, the reader should be able to (1) understand the mechanism of action of aspirin; (2) appreciate potential new mechanisms of salicylate and nsaids; (3) appreciate cox-2 gene suppression as a potential target of anti-inflammatory drugs.

basic studies in the 1990s have led to the discov-

ery of a second cyclooxygenase (cox), named cox-2.
cox-2 is structurally and enzymatically similar to
cox-1. however, a major difference is that cox-2 is
inducible by myriad mitogenic factors and cytokines,
whereas cox-1 is constitutively expressed.1 cox-2 has
been shown to play a major role in inflammation and
cancer growth.2–4 there is a great interest in developing
therapeutic agents targeted at cox-2. aspirin and most
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids) inhibit

cox-1 and cox-2 nonselectively.5 these agents often
cause gastrointestinal complications as they block the
gastrointestinal protection by cox-1. based on structural screening, several selective cox-2 inhibitors are
developed and now available for treating human inflammatory joint diseases. another important development is
the discovery that aspirin, salicylate, and certain nsaids
target cox-2 expression. it has been shown that aspirin
and nsaids have unexpected therapeutic properties
such as prevention of colon cancer.6 the mechanisms by

which aspirin and nsaids control diverse pathophysiological processes are not entirely clear. a large number of
studies have shown that aspirin and  xxxd3219xxx 
may act by interfering with the transcription of proinflammatory genes including cox-2. thus, there exist at
least three types of cox-2 inhibitors: (1) selective cox2 inhibitors, (2) nonselective cox-1 and cox-2 inhibitors, and (3) inhibitors of cox-2 gene expression.

potential cardiovascular
complications of selective cox-2
inhibitors
compounds that selectively inhibit cox-2 activity have
therapeutic effects on osteoarthritis and other inflammatory joint diseases and pain in general.7 these cox-2
selective inhibitors have a side chain that anchors to the
side pocket of cox-2 substrate channel.8 this side
pocket is not present in cox-1, and the bulky side
chain hinders the entrance of cox-2 selective inhibitors
into the active site of cox-1. cox-2 inhibitors are
considered to cause fewer bleeding complications than
nonselective cox inhibitors.9,10 however, recent clinical analysis suggests that selective cox-2 inhibitors
such as celeoxib and rofecoxib increase risk of cardiovascular events.11 results from animal experiments reveal
that selective cox-2 inhibitors aggravate cardiotoxicity
of  xxxd1816xxx .12 selective cox-2 inhibitors have
been shown to increase blood pressure.13 these adverse
cardiovascular effects are thought to be mediated by suppression of vascular prostacyclin production by selective
cox-2 inhibitors as cox-2 expression plays an important role in prostacyclin synthesis especially when vascular cells are under stress.14 these recent results raise concerns about the safety of selective cox-2 inhibitors.

aspirin preferentially inhibits cox1 activity: role in platelet
inhibition
aspirin, an acetyl derivative of  xxxd3159xxx , inhibits
cox-1 by acetylation of serine-530 of human cox-1
sequence.15,16 serine-530 is situated close to the cox-1
active site, and the acetyl group added to this serine
residue hinders the access of substrate ( xxxd208xxx ,
aa) to the active site.17 the active site structure of
cox-2 is similar to that of cox-1. however, cox-2
has a side pocket at the substrate channel that is absent in
cox-1.8 furthermore, the substrate channel of cox-2
is larger and more flexible.18 thus, although aspirin
acetylates the corresponding serine residues in cox-2,
the acetyl group does not completely block access to the
active site and aa metabolites are not significantly reduced unless the aspirin concentration is very high. it has
been estimated that aspirin is 10- to 100-fold more potent in inhibiting cox-1 activity than cox-2 activity.5

this aspirin property makes it an ideal platelet
inhibitor. platelet activation results in intracellular calcium elevation and protein kinase c activation, which
induce  xxxg1763xxx  translocation and activate its catalytic activity to liberate aa from membrane phospholipids. platelets express only cox-1 proteins18 and thromboxane synthase. the liberated aa is
converted to prostaglandin h2 by cox-1 and pgh2 is
converted to thromboxane a2 (txa2) by thromboxane
synthase. txa2 is a major endogenous inducer of platelet aggregation and plays an important role in platelet
recruitment and platelet aggregate formation. because
platelets are not capable of regenerating cox-1, a small
dose of aspirin is sufficient to inhibit cox-1 permanently and block txa2 synthesis. this accounts for the
successful prevention of arterial thrombosis (coronary
arterial and cerebrovascular diseases) by a relatively low
dose of aspirin.

aspirin and salicylate exert their
multiple pharmacological actions
by suppressing gene expressions
since the discovery that  xxxd3159xxx  was the active ingredient in willow bark extracts that possesses antiinflammatory actions,  xxxd3219xxx  and related salicylate compounds have been widely used in treating
inflammatory disorders.  xxxd3219xxx  has a bitter
taste that is uncomfortable to take. the acetyl derivative
of  xxxd3159xxx  ( xxxd234xxx ) was synthesized over a century ago and is not bitter but retains the
antiinflammatory action. it remains the most commonly used nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug on the
market. epidemiological studies have shown that aspirin usage is associated with reduced risk of colon cancer and breast cancer. although its antithrombotic action is mediated by its inhibition of platelet cox-1
with resultant reduction in thromboxane a2 synthesis
and platelet aggregation, the antiinflammatory action
and antineoplastic effect cannot be explained by its inhibition of cox-1 and/or cox-2 activity.

salicylate and aspirin block nf-bmediated gene expression at
suprapharmacological
concentrations
aspirin and  xxxd3219xxx  at concentrations higher
than 5 mm inhibited nf-b binding and nf-bmediated gene expression induced by phorbol esters,
 xxxg2296xxx  (tnf), and lipopolysaccharide.19
nf-b is a homo- and heterodimeric transactivator sequestered in cytosol by binding to a specific binding
protein, ib. signals from cell activation by tnf
and other agonists activate ib kinases (ikk and
ikk) that target ib for phosphorylation and subse-

quent ubiquitination and degradation.20 free nf-b is
translocated to nucleus where it binds to its cognate
sites on the promoter/enhancer region of diverse genes
and activates transcription of these genes including
many proinflammatory genes. salicylate at suprapharmacological concentrations (>5 mm) inhibits ikk activity, thereby reducing ib phosphorylation and dissociation from nf-b, nf-b translocation, and its
binding to its target genes.21 high doses of aspirin and
 xxxd3219xxx  protect neuronal damage by inhibiting
glutamate-mediated nf-b activation and control insulin resistance by interfering with ikk activation.22,23
these studies provide strong evidence for in vitro and in
vivo effects of high concentrations of aspirin and  xxxd3219xxx  on nf-b-mediated gene expression
and diseases. unfortunately, aspirin or  xxxd3219xxx 
at concentrations greater than 5 mm that inhibit nfb-mediated gene transcription are considered suprapharmacological as they cause severe adverse effects in
human subjects. it is, therefore, questionable that the
therapeutic actions of aspirin can be explained by this
mechanism.

inhibition of c/ebp binding and
c/ebp-mediated  xxxg1884xxx 
expression by therapeutic
concentrations of aspirin and
salicylate
 xxxd3219xxx  given to healthy human subjects inhibited urinary pge2 levels.24 at the cellular level,  xxxd3219xxx  at therapeutic concentrations suppressed
prostanoid production induced by phorbol esters and
cytokines without changing the basal level.25 these results suggest that salicylate may alter cox enzyme expression. to evaluate the effects of  xxxd3219xxx  and
aspirin on cox-2 and cox-1 expressions, we pretreated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs) and human foreskin fibroblasts (hffs) grown
in culture medium deprived of fetal bovine serum for 24
hours with increasing concentrations of aspirin or  xxxd3219xxx  (107 to 103 m) and measured cox-2
and cox-1 mrna and protein levels 2 and 4 hours
after stimulation of the cells with phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx 
13-acetate (pma) and interleukin-1 (il-1). aspirin
and  xxxd3219xxx  suppressed cox-2 mrna equipotently with a maximal suppression of 50 to 70%. suppression of cox-2 protein levels was in agreement with
that of cox-2 mrna levels.26 they had no effect on
cox-1 mrna or protein levels. nuclear runoff analysis shows suppression of nascent mrna production in
response to pma or il-1 stimulation. these results
are consistent with cox-2 transcriptional suppression
by  xxxd3219xxx .
to characterize the target of salicylate action, we
first demonstrated that  xxxd3219xxx  and aspirin in-

hibited cox-2 promoter activity in huvecs and
hffs. we have previously shown that human cox-2
promoter activity is fully expressed by a 0.9-kb 5'flanking fragment (891 to +9). we constructed this
fragment into a basic luciferase expression vector,
 xxxg2041xxx , and transfected hff or huvec with this construct. the promoter activity was stimulated by pma
and il-1. pretreatment of the transfected cells with
105 m  xxxd3219xxx  reduced the promoter activity
by ~50%.27 by contrast,  xxxd3219xxx  had no effect
on promoter activity stimulated by tnf, suggesting
that salicylate targets certain specific transactivators
required for pma and il-1 stimulation. analysis
of human and murine cox-2 has identified nf-b
sites (two sites in human and one in mouse cox-2),
ccaat/enhancer binding protein (c/ebp) sites (one
site in human and two in mouse), and a  xxxd1773xxx  response element (cre) all located within 500 bp from
the transcription start site as being involved in cox-2
transcription.28,29 however, it was unclear how each agonist activates cox-2 promoter activity. we analyzed
by 5'-deletion mutation and site-directed mutagenesis
the cis-acting regulatory elements required for cox-2
induction by pma, il-1, and tnf. the data clearly
show that cox-2 induction by pma and il- requires c/ebp and cre sites, whereas both nf-b
sites and the cre site are required for tnf induction. electrophoretic shift and supershift assays revealed
an increased binding of c/ebp transcriptional activator to the c/ebp site, and this increase was abrogated
by salicylate pretreatment. in contrast, salicylate  xxxd1891xxx 5
m had no effect on blocking cox-2 promoter activity
induced by tnf and did not inhibit binding of nfb to its cognate sites.27 these results indicate that aspirin and  xxxd3219xxx  at pharmacological concentrations selectively inhibit c/ebp binding in contrast
to inhibition of nf-b binding by suprapharmacological concentrations. based on these results, a model of
salicylate action is proposed (fig. 1). at pharmacological concentrations (105 to 103 m), aspirin and sodium
salicylate inhibit c/ebp binding to sequence-specific
dna, whereas at high concentrations (>5 mm), its action is switched to inhibition of nf-b activation.
it has been clearly shown that salicylate at high
concentrations targets ikk. it is likely that salicylate
at therapeutic concentrations also targets a kinase that
phosphorylates c/ebp. we have observed that increased c/ebp binding to dna induced by pma
was completely abolished by treatment with alkaline
phosphatase. pma had no effect on c/ebp protein
levels in nuclear extracts and salicylate did not reduce
the c/ebp protein level. work is in progress to identify the kinase that is inhibited by salicylate.
c/ebp (also know as nf- xxxg1181xxx ) mediates transcriptions of immunologically important genes. the effect of salicylate may not be limited to cox-2 suppres-

sion. it has recently been reported that salicylate at therapeutic concentrations suppressed il-4 expression.30
the promoter analysis suggested the potential involvement of a c/ebp site. it will be important to determine
whether salicylate downregulates il-4 expression by inhibiting c/ebp. our preliminary work suggests that
salicylate inhibits  xxxg1578xxx  expression by a c/ebp-dependent mechanism. it is speculated from these findings that salicylate suppresses an
array of proinflammatory genes whose expression requires c/ebp.
in summary, aspirin and  xxxd3219xxx  exhibit
an unusual concentration-related transcriptional suppression. at therapeutic concentration, salicylate specifically
targets c/ebp-dependent gene expression, whereas at
higher concentrations it blocks nf-b-mediated gene
expression. the c/ebp inhibition provides a plausible
explanation for the multiple diverse therapeutic actions
of aspirin and salicylate preparations.

vascular and tissue protective
properties of aspirin and
nonaspirin nsaids
aspirin protects against arterial thrombosis and ischemic myocardial and cerebral damage by several mechanisms, notably irreversible inhibition of platelet cox-1
and suppression of the expression of cox-2 and other
proinflammatory genes. most nonaspirin nsaids inhibit cox-1 and cox-2 activities nonselectively and
exhibit a variable degree of differential inhibition of
cox-2 versus cox-1.31 they are effective drugs for
treating inflammatory symptoms from joint and musculoskeletal diseases. however, their vascular protective
property is unclear.  xxxd3259xxx  and ibuprofen have been
shown to inhibit nf-b-mediated gene expression in
cultured cells.32,33 however, their effects on cox-2 expression have not been reported. several nonaspirin
nsaids have been shown to have tumor-suppressing
effects, and the mechanisms have been proposed to be

prostaglandin dependent and independent.34 thus, each
class of nsaids may have its potentially distinct
pharmacological actions. it no longer appears valid to
lump the large number of structurally different compounds as “aspirin-like” drugs. each class of nsaid
should be investigated individually with respect to pharmacological actions and molecular mechanisms. it is anticipated that these studies will provide new insight into
vascular and tissue protection and shed light on new therapeutic targets.
an important therapeutic strategy is emerging
from results of recent studies on the control of cox-2
gene expression. cox-2 gene expression is induced by
myriad stimuli and is sustained by a positive feedback
mechanism via pge2 and pgi2. these prostaglandins
activate adenylyl cyclase, thereby increasing intracellular
 xxxd1773xxx  levels and enhancing cox-2 transcription
via the pka pathway. a new therapeutic strategy is to
use combined “low”-dose selective cox-2 inhibitors and
aspirin. this combined approach will not totally inhibit
cox-2 activity but will substantially suppress cox-2
expression through the suppressing action of salicylate
and the interruption of the positive feedback regulation
by selective cox-2 inhibitors. because this combined
approach preserves the cardiovascular protective property
of cox-2, it may reduce considerably the cardiovascular
complications caused by cox-2 inhibition by a relatively
large dose of selective cox-2 inhibitors.
