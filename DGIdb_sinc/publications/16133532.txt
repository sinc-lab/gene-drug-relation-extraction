abstract sorafenib is a novel, small-molecule anticancer
compound that inhibits tumor cell proliferation by targeting raf in the raf/mek/erk signalling pathway,
and inhibits angiogenesis by targeting tyrosine kinases
such as vascular-endothelial growth factor receptor
( xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg802xxx ) and platelet-derived growth
factor receptor (pdgfr). in vitro microsomal data
indicate that sorafenib is metabolized by two pathways:
phase i oxidation mediated by cytochrome p450 (cyp)
3a4; and phase ii conjugation mediated by  xxxg2385xxx .
approximately 50% of an orally administered dose is
recovered as unchanged drug in the feces, due to either
biliary excretion or lack of absorption. the aim of this
study was to evaluate the eﬀect of  xxxg590xxx  inhibition by
ketoconazole on sorafenib pharmacokinetics. this was
an open-label, non-randomized, 2-period, one-way
crossover study in sixteen healthy male subjects. a single
50 mg dose of sorafenib was administered alone (period
1) and in combination with ketoconazole 400 mg once
daily (period 2) (ketoconazole was given for 7 days, and
a single 50 mg sorafenib dose was administered concomitantly on day 4). no clinically relevant change in
pharmacokinetics of sorafenib and no clinically relevant
adverse events or laboratory abnormalities were observed in this study upon co-administration of the two
drugs. plasma concentrations of the main cyp3a4
generated metabolite, sorafenib n-oxide, decreased
considerably upon ketoconazole co-administration. this
eﬀect is in accordance with the in vitro ﬁnding that
cyp3a4 is the primary enzyme for sorafenib n-oxide
formation. further, these data indicate that blocking
sorafenib metabolism by the cyp3a4 pathway will not

lead to an increase in sorafenib exposure. this is consistent with data from a clinical mass-balance study that
showed 15% of the administered dose was eliminated by
glucuronidation, compared to less than 5% eliminated
as oxidative metabolites. since there was no increase in
sorafenib exposure following concomitant administration of the highly potent cyp3a4 inhibitor ketoconazole with low dose sorafenib, it is postulated that higher
therapeutic doses of sorafenib may be safely co-administered with ketoconazole, as well as with other inhibitors of  xxxg590xxx .

introduction
sorafenib (4-{4-[3-(4-chloro-3-triﬂuoromethyl-phenyl)
ureido]phenoxy} pyridine 2-carboxylic acid methylamide 4-methylbenzenesulfonate) is a novel oral  xxxg1924xxx  and vascular-endothelial growth factor receptor
(vegfr) inhibitor that prevents tumor growth by
combining two anticancer activities: inhibition of tumor
cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis [9]. sorafenib
inhibits tumor cell proliferation by targeting the raf/
mek/erk signaling pathway at the level of  xxxg1924xxx ,
and exerts an anti-angiogenic eﬀect by targeting the
receptor tyrosine kinases  xxxg1274xxx ,  xxxg802xxx  and
platelet-derived growth factor receptor (pdgfr), and
their associated signaling cascades [9].
sorafenib has a mean half-life ranging from approximately 25 to 48 h. following oral administration of
[14c]-sorafenib tosylate to healthy volunteers, approximately 19% of the dose is excreted in urine, almost
exclusively as glucuronide conjugates of parent drug or
metabolites; and 77% in feces (50% as unchanged drug).
approximately 17% of circulating radioactivity in
plasma was in the form of sorafenib n-oxide. sorafenib

in vivo [15, 16]. as a result, ketoconazole is widely used
as a prototypical  xxxg590xxx  inhibitor [1]. the primary
objective of this study was to determine the eﬀect of
ketoconazole administration on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of 50 mg sorafenib in healthy volunteers.
a sub-therapeutic dose of sorafenib was used in this
study for safety reasons, because this was the ﬁrst study
to assess the interaction of sorafenib with a potent
 xxxg590xxx  inhibitor in healthy human volunteers and there
was a concern about the potential magnitude of interaction. the secondary objective was to assess the clinical
implications of co-administering sorafenib with  xxxg590xxx 
inhibitors based on the exposure and safety information
obtained from this study.

undergoes glucuronidation by the  xxxg2385xxx  pathway
and phase i oxidative metabolism by the cytochrome
p4503a4 (cyp3a4) enzyme system (data on ﬁle). the
cyp3a4 isoform is responsible for the oxidation of
more than half of all marketed drugs [8] and has been
identiﬁed as the major cyp isoform involved in the
oxidative metabolism of sorafenib (data on ﬁle). the
metabolic scheme for sorafenib is shown in fig. 1. sorafenib n-oxide was the major phase i metabolite
formed in vitro and also the main circulating metabolite
in human plasma. in addition, n-methylhydroxylation,
n-demethylation and combinations of all three metabolic reactions led to minor metabolites both in vitro
and in vivo. in addition to oxidative metabolism, 15%
of the administered dose of sorafenib was eliminated by
glucuronidation, a phase ii metabolic pathway.
the potential for drug-drug interactions between
concurrently administered cyp3a4 substrates and
cyp3a4 inhibitors is high due to the contribution of the
cyp3a4 enzyme to the metabolism of a wide range of
drugs [15]. further, like many new cytostatic anticancer
agents, sorafenib has a relatively wide therapeutic index
and is administered to patients with cancer who may be
taking other concomitant medications. at doses that are
above the recommended phase iii dose, there is an increased incidence of dose limiting toxicities such as
hand-foot syndrome, fatigue and diarrhea. in vitro
studies suggest that cyp3a4 is the primary phase i
oxidative pathway in the metabolism of sorafenib..
however, the relative contribution of the cyp3a4
pathway to the overall elimination of sorafenib was not
known. therefore, it was considered important to assess
the extent to which modulation of cyp3a4 activity by
other drugs may alter sorafenib exposure.
ketoconazole is an imidazole antifungal drug that
potently inhibits  xxxg590xxx  enzymes both in vitro and

methods
study design
this was an open-label, non-randomized, 2-period, oneway crossover study conducted in healthy male volunteers, in which sorafenib was administered alone (period
1) and concomitantly with ketoconazole (period 2) to
determine the eﬀect of potent  xxxg590xxx  enzyme inhibition
on sorafenib pharmacokinetics. a one-way crossover
design was used for safety reasons to ensure that the
subjects tolerated the single dose of sorafenib, prior to
administration of the combination treatment. the study
protocol was approved by the heartland institutional
review board, lenexa, ks and the study was conducted
at quintiles phase i services, lenexa, ks in accordance
with fda guidelines for good clinical practice (gcp).
all subjects gave written informed consent prior to
participating in this single-center study.

on day 1 of period 1, all subjects received a single
oral dose of sorafenib tosylate 50 mg tablet (calculated
as free base sorafenib). after at least a 10-day washout,
400 mg ketoconazole ( xxxd2422xxx , janssen pharmaceutica,
titusville, nj; batch 91p0982e) was administered for
three consecutive days in period 2. on day 4 in period 2,
a single dose of sorafenib tosylate 50 mg tablet (calculated as free base sorafenib) from the same batch as in
period 1 was co-administered with 400 mg ketoconazole.
sorafenib doses were administered in the fasted state
with 240 ml of water. ketoconazole was administered
for three additional days in period 2 (days 5, 6 and 7) to
maintain  xxxg590xxx  inhibition for the duration of blood
sampling. blood samples (5 ml) for the determination of
sorafenib and its metabolite concentrations in plasma
were collected before and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24,
48, 72, 96, 120, and 168 h after drug administration.
samples were prepared by centrifugation to obtain
plasma, which was frozen at 20 c until analysis.
during period 1, subjects remained in the clinic from
the evening of day-1 until the morning of day 5. the
ﬁnal sorafenib dose was given on day 4. subjects returned to the clinic for a brief visit on the mornings of
days 6 (48 h) and 8 (96 h)to have blood drawn for sorafenib pharmacokinetics. during period 2, subjects remained in the clinic from the evening of day-1 until the
morning of day 8. they returned to the clinic on the
mornings of days 9 (120 h) and 11 (168 h) for sorafenib
pharmacokinetic sample collection.
sample size
from an earlier bayer sorafenib study, the withinsubject standard deviation for the log-transformed
auc(0–¥) was estimated to be 0.36. for the current
study, with 16 subjects, and assuming a within-subject
sd for log-transformed auc(0–¥) of 0.36, a 90% conﬁdence interval for the ratio of least squares geometric
means auc(0–¥) of the two treatments (i.e., sorafenib
administered with or without ketoconazole) would have
a lower/upper limit equal to the observed ratio of means
divided/multiplied by 1.251. if the observed ratio of
means was 1.0, the 90% conﬁdence interval for the ratio
of least squares geometric means auc(0–¥) of the two
treatments would be (0.799, 1.251).
although the 90% conﬁdence interval calculated
above approximately met the standard bioequivalence
criteria of the ‘‘no eﬀect’’ bounds 80–125%, this study
was considered an observational trial conducted to
determine the magnitude of change in sorafenib pharmacokinetics with concomitant ketoconazole administration. this is consistent with the fda’s guidance for
industry entitled, ‘‘in vivo drug metabolism/drug
interaction studies—study design, data analysis, and
recommendations for dosing and labeling’’ [4]. this
study, with 16 subjects, provided adequate information
on the eﬀect of ketoconazole on sorafenib pharmacokinetics.

subjects
sixteen healthy male volunteers participated in the
study. subjects were determined to be healthy on the
basis of a physical examination and laboratory
screening prior to study initiation. subjects were required to test negative for a urine drug screen and
also for hiv, hepatitis b and hepatitis c. subjects
with a history of major medical or organ disorder,
recent illness, malignancy, psychiatric or mental illness,
chronic dermatitis or skin condition, clinically signiﬁcant allergic disease, abnormal laboratory values, drug
hypersensitivity or allergies to investigational agents,
or those who had undergone treatment with prescription medication, cimetidine or herbal products
within 14 days of day 1, period 1 were excluded from
the study. further, use of these products during the
study was prohibited. subjects who had a history of
drug or alcohol abuse, current smoking (ten cigarettes
or equivalent per day) or excessive consumption of
caﬀeine containing products (>5 eight ounce cups of
coﬀee or caﬀeine containing beverages) or had donated blood or been treated with an investigational
agent within 30 days prior to study commencement
were excluded from the study. over-the-counter medications were not allowed for 48 h before and 48 h
after dosing in each period. consumption of grapefruit
or grapefruit juice or products containing grapefruit
juice was not allowed for 72 h before and 72 h after
sorafenib or ketoconazole administration.
safety assessment
a 12-lead ecg (supine) recording was assessed as part
of the screening process and at the last visit to the clinic
(period 2, day 11). safety and tolerability were assessed
by clinical laboratory analyses (hematology, chemistry,
and urinalysis), vital sign measurements and wellness
assessment. hematology and chemistry were performed
as part of the pre-screening (no more than 21 days before study start) and/or on period 1, day 1 (pre-dose)
and period 2, days 1 (pre-dose), 4 (pre-dose), 7 (predose) and 11 (end of study). urinalysis was performed as
part of the screening process and at the last visit to the
clinic (period 2, day 11). vital sign assessments were
performed on period 1, day 1 through 5 and period 2,
day 1 through 7. wellness assessments were performed
on each visit. all adverse events were documented in
detail.
bioanalytical methods
a validated lc/ms/ms method, speciﬁc for the measurement of sorafenib and its metabolite concentrations
in human plasma was used. in brief, an aliquot of
plasma (0.2 ml) was transferred into a screw cap culture
tube (13·100 mm), internal standard solution (40 ll)
containing 40 ng of [ xxxd2360xxx , 15n]-sorafenib tosylate were

688

added and the sample was mixed. samples were extracted with methyl-t-butyl ether (2.5 ml) on an automatic shaker at 200 rpm for 15 min and then centrifuged
at 3,000 rpm (3,200 g) for 5 min at 4c. after centrifugation, each test tube was immersed in a dry ice and
acetone bath to ﬂash-freeze the aqueous layer. the organic solvent was decanted and evaporated to dryness at
50c under a stream of nitrogen for about 12 min. the
samples were reconstituted in acetonitrile (100 ll) and
transferred to an autosampler vial. an aliquot (10 ll)
of this solution was injected into the lc/ms/ms system.
the mobile phase consisted of 10 mm ammonium acetate (ph=3.0) : acetonitrile (10:90, v/v) and was delivered at a ﬂow rate of 0.7 ml/min (perkin elmer series
200 lc pump with series 200 autosampler). the chromatography column (zorbax sb-c8 column,
4.6·150 mm, 3.5 lm) was maintained at 30c. detection was by tandem mass spectrometry using a sciex 365
mass spectrometer with a heated nebulizer interface
operating in the multiple reaction monitoring, positive
ion mode. the calibration range for the method was 0.01
to 12 mg/l for sorafenib and 0.01 to 2.5 mg/l for sorafenib n-oxide. the lower limit of quantitation (loq)
for sorafenib and its metabolite was 0.01 mg/l and the
intra- and inter-day coeﬃcients of variation were less
than 8%. the accuracy and precision at the lowest calibrator (0.01 mg/l) were 99.4% and 4.2% respectively
for sorafenib and 98.7% and 2.62% respectively for
sorafenib n-oxide. quality control samples were analyzed along with the samples of analytes of interest.
pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis
pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using
standard non-compartmental methods. the following
parameters were determined from the plasma concentration-time proﬁles of sorafenib and its n-oxide
metabolite: maximum observed plasma concentration
(cmax); the area under the plasma concentration-time
curve (auc) from time 0 to the last quantiﬁable concentration at time t (auc(0–t)), determined by the loglinear trapezoidal rule; and auc extrapolated to inﬁnity
(auc(0–¥)), calculated as auc(0–t)+cn/kz, where kz is
the terminal elimination rate constant determined by
regression analysis, and cn is the last measurable concentration. the half-life (t1/2) was calculated as 0.693/kz.
descriptive statistics of plasma concentrations and
the derived pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated
for sorafenib given alone and in combination with ketoconazole. the natural logarithms of auc(0–¥) and
cmax and other derived pharmacokinetic variables were
analyzed using analysis of variance (anova) with
terms for treatment and subject. a 90% two-sided
conﬁdence interval (ci) for the ratio of geometric means
of the two treatment conditions was calculated. equality
of means was evaluated at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level.

statistical analyses were performed using sas, version
8.0 (sas institute, cary, nc, usa).

results
patient baseline statistics/demographics
the study was conducted in healthy male subjects with a
mean (± sd) age of 28±9 years (range 21–45 years).
the mean (± sd) weight was 81±12.6 kg (range 56–
101 kg); the mean (± sd) body mass index was
25.8±3.2 (range 19.8–31.6) and the mean (± sd) height
was 176.2±5.9 cm (range 167–183 cm). there were 12
caucasians and four african americans. one subject
who discontinued prematurely was an african american
male, who weighed 101 kg, and was 183 cm tall.

eﬀect of ketoconazole on sorafenib pharmacokinetics
fifteen of the 16 subjects completed both treatment
periods and were valid for the pharmacokinetic analysis.
the mean plasma concentration-time proﬁles of sorafenib and sorafenib n-oxide with and without ketoconazole are shown in fig. 2 and the individual
auc(0–¥) and cmax data are shown in fig. 3. the
pharmacokinetic parameter estimates by treatment are
presented in table i. two other oxidative metabolites
seen in in vitro studies and described in the introduction
section were below quantitation limits in this study.
overall, the mean concentration-time proﬁles of sorafenib were similar with and without ketoconazole
(fig. 2) and co-administration of ketoconazole (400 mg
per day) did not aﬀect the single-dose pharmacokinetics
of sorafenib 50 mg. the geometric means for auc(0–¥)
and cmax were marginally smaller in the presence of
ketoconazole. the geometric mean auc(0–¥) values for
sorafenib were 11.04 and 9.82 mg*h/l, respectively
(table 1), when administered alone and in combination
with ketoconazole. the corresponding geometric mean
cmax values for sorafenib were 0.46 and 0.34 mg/l
respectively when administered alone and in combination with ketoconazole. the terminal elimination t1/2 of
sorafenib was approximately 30 h in each period. the
geometric mean ratio (gmr) (with corresponding 90%
ci in parentheses) for sorafenib auc(0–¥) was 0.89
(0.69–1.14) and the gmr (with corresponding 90% ci
in parenthesis) for sorafenib cmax was 0.74 (0.56–0.97).
although ketoconazole administration did not inﬂuence sorafenib pharmacokinetics, it did aﬀect the pharmacokinetic proﬁle of the metabolite, sorafenib n-oxide,
as shown in fig. 2. whereas sorafenib n-oxide was
measurable following administration of sorafenib alone,
in the presence of ketoconazole, plasma metabolite
concentrations were measurable in only one sample

safety and tolerability
fifteen subjects completed both periods of the study.
one subject did not return to the clinic for period 2 for
reasons unrelated to the drug treatment. all 16 subjects
were valid for the safety evaluation. there were no
clinically relevant changes in vital signs, ecg recordings, or laboratory safety parameters for any subject.
four subjects of sixteen (25%) reported at least one
treatment-emergent adverse event during administration
of sorafenib alone (period 1), compared to ﬁve subjects
of ﬁfteen (33%) dosed with the combination of sorafenib
and ketoconazole (period 2). two subjects of ﬁfteen
(13%) reported at least one treatment-emergent event
during the ketoconazole treatment preceding sorafenib
dosing in period 2. one subject of ﬁfteen (7%) reported

drug-related adverse events during the sorafenib and
ketoconazole combination treatment. the adverse
events included nausea, tremor, and hypotension. no
serious adverse events were reported in this study.
sporadic laboratory abnormalities were transient and
slight. none of these were deemed to be clinically relevant. no changes or trends with respect to vital signs
were observed in association with sorafenib dosing
across the two periods. there was no individual qt
interval greater than 450 ms. thus, sorafenib was considered safe and well tolerated both with and without
ketoconazole administration when administered at a low
dose.

stant (ki) for 1¢-hydroxymidazolam formation of
14.9 nm in human liver microsomes and 26.7 nm in
cdna-expressed cyp3a4 [5]. ketoconazole is classiﬁed

as a strong in vivo  xxxg590xxx  inhibitor on the basis of its
eﬀects on oral midazolam auc [1]. ketoconazole 400 mg
daily for four days caused a 16-fold increase in the auc of
midazolam after oral administration [10]. ketoconazole
administration has also been shown to markedly aﬀect the
pharmacokinetics of a number of other  xxxg590xxx  substrates including alprazolam,  xxxd1708xxx ,  xxxd2092xxx , lovastatin, nifedipine, simvastatin, terfenadine, and triazolam
leading to clinically relevant drug-drug interactions [15].
therefore, ketoconazole was chosen as the inhibitor in
this study to assess the eﬀect of cyp3a4 inhibition on the
pharmacokinetics of sorafenib.
sorafenib is a novel  xxxg1924xxx  and vegfr inhibitor
that is being investigated for use in a variety of cancers
[3, 6, 7, 11, 13]. sorafenib is eliminated by a combination
of cyp3a4-mediated oxidative metabolism, phase ii
glucuronidation, and (possibly) biliary secretion, with
glucuronidated metabolites accounting for approximately 19% of an oral dose. after co-administration of
a single dose of sorafenib on a background of daily
dosing with ketoconazole, there was no increase in sorafenib auc and cmax mean values, and no change in
terminal elimination half-life, compared to administration of sorafenib alone. there was a small decrease in
mean sorafenib auc when co-administered with ketoconazole. because of sorafenib’s intra-subject variability, some subjects showed an increase in auc(0–¥)
whereas other subjects showed a decrease in auc(0–¥)
upon co-administration of sorafenib with ketoconazole.
the maximum increase in exposure, in one subject, was
a 3-fold increase in auc. there were no adverse events
as a result of this increase. sorafenib is well tolerated
over a 10-fold range of exposures in clinical studies in
cancer patients. the change in exposure seen in these
subjects is well within this range and is not likely to lead
to safety or tolerability issues in the clinical setting [14].
the formation of sorafenib n-oxide was decreased by
ketoconazole, consistent with ketoconazole’s known
activity as a  xxxg590xxx  inhibitor. however, this decrease
did not result in an increase in sorafenib plasma con-

centrations. the eﬀect of ketoconazole is more pronounced on high clearance drugs [2] that are exclusively
metabolized by the cyp3a4 pathway. this is consistent
with sorafenib either being a low clearance drug and/or a
drug that is not predominantly eliminated by cyp3a4
metabolism. in vitro metabolism studies with human
hepatocytes have shown that sorafenib is metabolized to
form an n-oxide by the cyp3a4 pathway. additionally,
sorafenib is metabolized by the phase ii glucuronidation
pathway. in vivo mass balance studies in humans using
radiolabeled sorafenib, have demonstrated that 19% of
the administered dose is excreted in the urine, primarily
as sorafenib glucuronide (15% of dose), and 77% of
the drug dose is eliminated in the feces. neither the noxide metabolite nor the glucuronide metabolite of sorafenib are detected in feces. this may be due to instability of these metabolites in the presence of bacterial
reductases and bacterial glucuronidases present in the gi
tract. therefore, the actual fraction of administered dose
excreted in feces by the oxidative or glucuronidation
pathway may have been underestimated in the mass
balance study. however, available urinary excretion data
indicates that glucuronidation plays an important role in
the elimination of sorafenib. data from this study
showing that blocking the cyp3a4 based oxidative
pathway does not lead to an increase in sorafenib exposure, aﬃrms the importance of the glucuronidation
pathway in sorafenib’s elimination. glucuronidation is
not considered a limiting pathway under normal physiologic conditions and is not saturated under normal
circumstances. therefore, even though observed data
indicates that sorafenib glucuronide elimination accounts for only 15% of the dose when the drug is given
alone, more sorafenib could be eliminated by this pathway if the cyp3a4 based oxidative pathway is blocked.
given the importance of the glucuronidation pathway in
the elimination of sorafenib and that it is not saturated
under normal circumstances, the likelihood of an increase in sorafenib exposure following inhibition of the
 xxxg590xxx  pathway is low.
since the eﬀect of co-administration of ketoconazole
on the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib was unknown,
the 50 mg dose was intentionally selected for safety
reasons to avoid potential over-exposure of the compound in healthy volunteers. higher sorafenib doses
have been used in the clinic with 400 mg bid being the
dose used in phase iii trials. throughout the dosing
range, up to clinically evaluated doses of 800 mg bid,
the ratio’s of cmax and auc of cyp3a4 mediated
oxidative metabolites to the cmax and auc of sorafenib are similar, indicating linearity of cyp3a4
mediated metabolism at and above the therapeutic dose
(unpublished data). if the cyp3a4 pathway were
blocked by ketoconazole, when administering therapeutic doses of sorafenib, more sorafenib would likely
get metabolized by the glucuronidation pathway. since
glucuronidation is a high capacity pathway, it is not
expected to saturate at higher sorafenib doses and
therefore a large cyp3a4-mediated interaction would

not be expected following administration of cyp3a4
inhibitors. data from this study indicate that a low
dose of sorafenib can be safely co-administered with
drugs known to inhibit  xxxg590xxx -mediated metabolism
(e.g., azole antifungals including ketoconazole). the
interaction between the therapeutic dose (400 mg bid)
of sorafenib with ketoconazole has not been investigated. the fraction of sorafenib that is metabolized by
the phase i oxidative pathway appears to be low, i.e.,
<30%, (data on ﬁle). it is also metabolized by phase ii
glucuronidation. therefore, the likelihood of a clinically signiﬁcant increase in sorafenib exposure, at the
therapeutic dose, when administered with a cyp3a4
inhibitor is low [12].
consistent with the comparable sorafenib plasma
concentrations seen in the presence and absence of ketoconazole, no diﬀerences in the side eﬀect proﬁle were
observed in the two treatment periods. no clinically
relevant drug-related adverse events or laboratory
abnormalities were observed in this study. based on the
pharmacokinetic and safety data obtained from this
study, the results suggest that sorafenib may be safely
administered at low dose with drugs known to inhibit
 xxxg590xxx -mediated metabolism and that no dose adjustment may be necessary during concomitant therapy.
additionally, the likelihood of a clinically signiﬁcant
increase in sorafenib exposure, at the therapeutic dose, is
low. in a recently completed clinical trial, patients who
received 400 mg bid sorafenib chronically with cyp3a4
inhibitors had a similar safety proﬁle to those who did
not receive cyp3a4 inhibitors.
conclusions
this study demonstrated that co-administration of the
strong  xxxg590xxx  inhibitor ketoconazole had no eﬀect on
the auc(0–¥) and cmax of sorafenib at a single 50 mg
dose. consistent with ketoconazole’s known activity as
an inhibitor of  xxxg590xxx , the formation of the phase i
oxidative metabolite, sorafenib n-oxide, was decreased
by ketoconazole. however, this decrease did not result
in a corresponding increase in plasma concentrations of
sorafenib, possibly because other elimination pathways
(e.g., glucuronidation) may also play a signiﬁcant role in
sorafenib elimination. upon co-administration of a
single 50 mg dose of sorafenib with ketoconazole, there
was no apparent change in sorafenib exposure or its side
eﬀect proﬁle. this study indicates that no dose adjustment of sorafenib is necessary upon co-administration
with ketoconazole. although this study investigated a
50 mg sorafenib dose, rather than the currently proposed therapeutic dose of 400 mg, the results are considered relevant to the higher dose because (a) the
relative contribution of cyp3a4 to sorafenib elimination is fairly stable over the dose range of 50 to
400 mg,and (b) sorafenib has alternate elimination
pathways that account for a signiﬁcant fraction of the
administered dose. it is considered unlikely that ke-

692

toconazole would produce a clinically signiﬁcant increase in sorafenib exposure.
