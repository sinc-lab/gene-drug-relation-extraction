abstract
for peripheral t-cell lymphomas (ptcl), anti- xxxg393xxx  (alemtuzumab) therapy is currently under investigation. previous
studies reported widely divergent  xxxg393xxx  expression within ptcl using conventional immunohistochemistry. to accurately
discriminate between the presumed mechanistically relevant  xxxg393xxx  expression in tumor versus bystander cells, we employed
immunofluorescence double stains using  xxxg393xxx  in combination with an antibody directed against the rearranged t-cell
receptor vb-segment of the neoplastic clone in 6 angioimmunoblastic t-cell lymphomas (aitl) and 5 ptcl, unspecified
(ptcl-nos) and, in combination with  xxxg2302xxx , in 18 anaplastic large cell lymphomas (alcl). tumor cells in all aitl and
ptcl-nos were  xxxg393xxx  positive, while in 17 of 18 alcl no specific staining was observed. conversely, the background
t- and b-cell infiltrate showed a consistent positivity for  xxxg393xxx . our approach helps to precisely define  xxxg393xxx  expression in
the tumor cell population of ptcl and might therefore be valuable when evaluating the response to alemtuzumab therapy in
prospective clinical trials.

introduction
peripheral t-cell lymphomas (ptcl) are rare
neoplasms that constitute approximately 10% of
newly diagnosed lymphomas in western countries
[1,2]. in general, ptcl are clinically aggressive and
show poor outcome following conventional chemotherapy [2] emphasising the need for new,
innovative treatment strategies. in addition to high
dose chemotherapy with subsequent autologous stem
cell transplantation, receptor-directed antibody
therapies coupled with conventional chemotherapy
are currently under investigation in prospective trials
[3–6]. at present, one promising agent is an antibody
directed against  xxxg393xxx , a small glycoprotein of 21–28
kda that is linked by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(gpi) anchor to the surface membrane of t- and

b-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, monocytes,
macrophages and some dendritic cells, whereas it is
not expressed by granulocytes, erythrocytes, platelets
and hematopoietic progenitor cells. the function of
 xxxg393xxx  and its potential natural ligand(s) still remains
enigmatic [7–13].
alemtuzumab ( xxxd107xxx ) is a humanised igg1
antibody directed against the  xxxg393xxx  antigen.
although its mechanism of action has not yet been
fully understood, it is presumed that the effect is a
combination of complement-dependent cytolysis,
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity by
binding to fcg receptors on effector cells, and
induction of apoptosis [9,14–18]. a direct growth
inhibitory effect of alemtuzumab has also been
demonstrated on target cells with high  xxxg393xxx 
expression levels.  xxxg393xxx  expressing cells surviving

 xxxg393xxx  expression in t-cell lymphoma
treatment with alemtuzumab show a downregulation
of  xxxg393xxx  and other gpi-linked proteins, due to a
defective synthesis of mature gpi-precursors [19].
in recent years, the utility of alemtuzumab has
been explored in the treatment of b- and t-cell
neoplasms, such as b-cell chronic lymphocytic
leukemia, ptcl, t-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia
and cutaneous t-cell lymphoma, but also as an agent
for the prevention of a graft versus host disease
following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation
[4,20–28]. despite promising results, the therapy
with alemtuzumab is accompanied by substantial
toxicity and severe infectious complications due to
a marked and prolonged lymphopenia [25,29].
accordingly, an alemtuzumab therapy should ideally
be restricted to those patients who are most likely to
benefit from this drug; however, criteria to identify
such patients have not been established yet.
although several reports [4,30–33] provide information on the  xxxg393xxx  expression in various subsets of
t-cell lymphomas, these studies suffer from two
limitations. first, a reliable morphologic distinction
between neoplastic and reactive bystander t-cells is
difficult or even impossible in many cases of ptclnot otherwise specified (ptcl-nos) and angioimmunoblastic t-cell lymphoma (aitl). this might
explain the widely variable results on  xxxg393xxx  expression in different ptcl subsets in published studies
using a single stain approach for  xxxg393xxx . second,
immunohistochemical staining for  xxxg393xxx  on paraffin
embedded tissue sections may produce artificial
effects and, in addition, the  xxxg393xxx  staining pattern
in individual cells (nuclear vs. cytoplasmic vs. membranous) has been largely neglected so far.
since the neoplastic t-cells in ptcl can be
distinguished from the background infiltrate by their
clonally rearranged t-cell receptor (tcr) that is
expressed on the cell surface, we employed our
previously described technique to detect the tumor
cell population in ptcl by tcrvb-specific antibodies on frozen tissue sections [34]. specifically, we
applied immunofluorescent double and triple stains
in frozen sections to investigate  xxxg393xxx  expression in
the tumor and bystander cells in cases of ptclnos, aitl and anaplastic large cell lymphoma
(alcl) and compared the results with those
obtained in corresponding paraffin sections.
materials and methods
we analysed  xxxg393xxx  expression in tumor and reactive
b- and t-cells in six aitl, five ptcl-nos and
nine  xxxg144xxx  (alk)þ alcl
cases that had stored frozen and paraffin embedded
tissue in the tumor bank of the institute of pathology,
university of würzburg, and based on the availability

1011

of an antibody directed against the rearranged tcr
vb-segment of the respective tumor cell clone. in
addition, nine alk7 alcl were studied in paraffin
embedded material, and one of these cases had
corresponding frozen tissue available (table i). all
cases were reviewed using hematoxylin/eosin, giemsa, and periodic acid-schiff stained sections as well as
using a broad selection of immunohistochemical
markers to establish a diagnosis according to the
who classification scheme [2].
in the ptcl-nos and aitl cases, we first
identified the rearranged tcr vb-segment in the
tumor clone by polymerase chain reaction (pcr)
[34]. subsequently, we investigated the expression of
 xxxg393xxx  in combination with the respective vb-segment
specific antibody using double immunofluorescence
stains on frozen sections. in alcl cases, we used
 xxxg2302xxx  as a tumor specific marker, because in this
entity the tumor cells do not express a tcr on their
cell surface [35]. for the evaluation of the reactive band t-cells, we performed triple immunofluorescence
stainings with  xxxg393xxx /cd79a/cd3 in all aitl and
ptcl-nos cases [34]. dilutions and sources of all
primary and secondary antibodies are provided in
table ii. the detailed immunohistochemistry protocol has been described previously [34]. the images
were evaluated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (leica tcs2, wetzlar, germany). ethics
approval for the entire study was obtained from the
ethics committee, medical faculty, university of
wuerzburg, germany.

results
 xxxg393xxx  expression in peripheral t-cell lymphomas -not
otherwise specified and angioimmunoblastic t-cell
lymphomas (ailt)
using immunofluorescence double stains with  xxxg393xxx 
in combination with an antibody directed against the
respective tcr vb-segment rearranged in the tumor
cells on tissue sections from fresh frozen material, we
could detect a moderate to strong membranous
positivity for  xxxg393xxx  in virtually all tumor cells in 5/5
ptcl-nos [figure 1(a)] and 6/6 aitl cases
[figure 1(b)].
to determine  xxxg393xxx  expression in the bystander
t- and b-cell population in ptcl, we employed
immunofluorescence triple stains ( xxxg393xxx /cd3/
cd79a) on tissue sections from fresh frozen material.
in most cases of ptcl-nos and aitl, membranous  xxxg393xxx  positivity that was detected in virtually all
accompanying t-cells was strong, while b-cells
showed only a moderate staining intensity (table
i). intriguingly, no specific membranous positivity
for  xxxg393xxx  could be observed in the same tumors

we also investigated  xxxg393xxx  expression in alkþ and
alk7 alcl using  xxxg2302xxx  as a tumor cell marker. in
immunoflourescence double stains with  xxxg393xxx  on
sections from fresh frozen material that was available
from 9/9 alkþ alcl and 1/9 alk7 alcl we
could not detect a  xxxg393xxx  positivity in the tumor cells
[figure 1(c)] with one single exception. one alkþ
alcl expressed  xxxg393xxx  in approximately 30% of the
tumor cells with a weak to moderate membranous
 xxxg393xxx  positivity. in all 10 cases there was a moderate
to strong  xxxg393xxx  positivity in small cd307 background cells, serving as an internal positive control.
on paraffin sections that were available from 7/9
alkþ and all alk7 alcl cases, we could not
detect a specific membranous  xxxg393xxx  positivity in the
tumor cells or in the small bystander cells using
 xxxg2302xxx / xxxg393xxx  immunofluorescence double stains
[figure 1(d)]. in accordance with the staining results
on paraffin sections from ptcl-nos and aitl

in the present study, we evaluated  xxxg393xxx  expression in
ptcl-nos, aitl and alcl cases. in view of
current treatment approaches that combine alemtuzumab, a humanised antibody directed against the
 xxxg393xxx  antigen, with multi-agent chemotherapy in
ptcl, the  xxxg393xxx  expression status in these tumors
is under intense investigation. although a number of
previous publications have addressed this issue [4,30–
33], the interpretation of the results is hampered by
two limitations. first, the tumor cell population in
ptcl, specifically in aitl, may not be easily
identifiable by morphological features and, second,
 xxxg393xxx  staining on paraffin sections may produce
artefacts precluding a definite interpretation of the
results. we have tried to overcome these limitations
by applying our previously described approach, in
which we determine the clonally rearranged tcr
vb-segment in the tumor cells by pcr and then use
fluorescent double stains in frozen sections that
combine  xxxg393xxx  with an antibody directed against
the rearranged tcr vb-segment of the respective
tumor cell clone. using this technique, we demonstrate strong  xxxg393xxx  positivity in the tumor cells in all
ptcl-nos and aitl cases investigated, whereas
tumor cells in alcl cases, with one single exception, remained negative. moreover, our study
highlights the problematic interpretation of immunohistochemical  xxxg393xxx  staining in paraffin sections, in
which a rather unspecific nuclear and/or weak
cytoplasmic staining pattern prevailed. these factors
may, at least in part, be responsible for widely varying
results of  xxxg393xxx  expression in ptcl in published
studies. for example, chang et al. investigated the
 xxxg393xxx  expression in 97 t-cell lymphomas on paraffin
sections and reported on a  xxxg393xxx  expression in 47% of
nk/t-cell lymphomas, 40% of ptcl-nos and 22%
of alcl. in accordance with our experience, results
in 14 aitl cases were inconclusive, as neoplastic and
bystander t-cells could not be reliably distinguished
from each other [30]. in addition, the authors did not
comment on the staining pattern of  xxxg393xxx  (membranous vs. nuclear/cytoplasmic) making the correlation
with our results difficult. variable results were also
obtained in two other studies [4,31]. gallamini et al.
investigated  xxxg393xxx  expression immunohistochemically in 15/24 patients with ptcl that were included
in a prospective multicentre trial and that received
alemtuzumab and chop chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone)

as first line treatment. although there was no general
correlation between  xxxg393xxx  expression and treatment
outcome, the authors speculated that the intensity
rather than the percentage of the neoplastic cells with
 xxxg393xxx  expression may be relevant for the response
prediction to alemtuzumab [4].
piccaluga et al. analysed the  xxxg393xxx  expression in
ptcl by gene expression profiling and at the
immunohistochemical level and found a physiological  xxxg393xxx  expression level in approximately 40% of
ptcl, while the remaining 60% of cases showed a
 xxxg393xxx  gene expression level that was below the
lowest one recorded in normal t-cells. apart from a
downregulation of  xxxg393xxx  in neoplastic cells this may
also be caused by a variable amount of background
cells, but the authors report that the gene expression
data paralleled  xxxg393xxx  staining in those cases undergoing both molecular analysis and immunohistochemical evaluation [31].
one study that paid attention to the subcellular
staining pattern of  xxxg393xxx  in paraffin sections was
performed by rodig et al., in which 294 cases of
various hematologic neoplasms were investigated for
 xxxg393xxx  expression. cases that showed strong staining
of the cytoplasm and the cell membrane were scored
as positive, whereas a rarely observed nuclear
staining pattern was considered non-specific. among
the ptcl investigated, all alcl and the majority of
aitl were negative for  xxxg393xxx  expression and only
35% of ptcl-nos expressed detectable levels of
the antigen.
interestingly, a comparison of the results in 18
t-cell neoplasms with paraffin-embedded tissue and
corresponding frozen tissue from the same tumor
yielded a high concordance, which is in sharp
contrast to the results of our study [33]. miles et al.
also observed in their study that  xxxg393xxx  expression
varied with regard to the subcellular localisation and
the intensity. although many cases displayed a
diffuse cytoplasmic staining, only in a minority of
cases a partial membranous staining pattern could be
discerned on paraffin sections. overall, the authors
concluded that nearly all cases of pediatric burkitt
lymphoma, t- and b-lymphoblastic leukemia, diffuse large b-cell lymphoma and alcl expressed
 xxxg393xxx  in their series [32].
in a quantitative flow cytometry assay that is not
hampered by fixation artefacts present in paraffinembedded tumor tissue, the response to anti- xxxg393xxx 
therapy corresponded in some, but not all cases of tprolymphocytic leukemia and b-chronic lymphocytic
leukemia with the intensity of  xxxg393xxx  expression [36].
interestingly, in this study, the  xxxg393xxx  expression in
b-cells was generally lower than that in t-cells which
correlates well with our observation that the  xxxg393xxx 
positivity in the b-cell background infiltrate was in

most cases moderate, while the  xxxg393xxx  positivity in
the t-cell background infiltrate was generally strong.
in a recently published study of  xxxg393xxx  expression
in t-cell malignancies using flow cytometry, jiang
et al. investigated – besides other entities – 3 cases of
aitl, 13 cases of ptcl-nos and 2 cases of alcl
[37]. their results that show expression of  xxxg393xxx  in
all (3 of 3) ailt, in 12 of 13 ptcl-nos and in 1 of
2 alcl are overall highly similar to ours. however,
except for ptcl with a tumor cell specific antigen
expression (e.g.  xxxg2302xxx  in alcl and  xxxg1417xxx  or  xxxg1688xxx 
in ailt), flow cytometric assays may not always
be able to accurately distinguish the tumor cell
population from reactive, admixed  xxxg393xxx -positive
cells. on the other hand, flow cytometry may be
superior for detecting lower  xxxg393xxx  expression levels
and for a more exact quantification of the anti- xxxg393xxx 
antibody-binding capacity of the neoplastic t-cells.
the negativity of almost all alcl cases for  xxxg393xxx 
expression in our study is not surprising given that
alcl lack expression of a tcr [35]. it has been
demonstrated that  xxxg393xxx  associates with the tcr on
the surface of intact t-cells and that the expression of
both cd45 and the tcr are essential for coupling
 xxxg393xxx  to an intracellular signal cascade [12].
the in vivo response to alemtuzumab may also
depend on other factors than purely the  xxxg393xxx 
expression of the tumor cells. for example, the
bioavailability of the antibody may be poor in bulky
lymph nodes, and its effectiveness may require
essential host effector functions that can be impaired
in patients with ptcl by the neoplastic disease itself
or by preceding radio- and chemotherapies. accordingly,  xxxg393xxx -expressing bystander b- or t-cells may
also play a role in the general response to alemtuzumab therapy. a thorough correlation between the
patients’ response to alemtuzumab and  xxxg393xxx 
expression in the neoplastic cells themselves, but
also in bystander b- and t-cells, will have to be
performed in the context of future prospective
clinical trials. in view of widely varying results in
previous studies, our data suggest that single stain
approaches for  xxxg393xxx  may be more reliable on frozen
sections than on paraffin-embedded tissue. moreover, the combined staining of  xxxg393xxx  with an
antibody directed against the rearranged tcr vbsegment of the respective tumor cell clone in
fluorescence double stains may help to determine
whether  xxxg393xxx  expression on the tumor cells and/or
in the bystander population is an important feature
that predicts response to alemtuzumab therapy in
patients with ptcl. these new insights might
ultimately lead to the identification of patients with
ptcl who will benefit from a therapy with
alemtuzumab, whereas in others severe side effects
that occur at a high incidence could be avoided.
