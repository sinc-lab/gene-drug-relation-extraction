introduction
gastrointestinal prokinetic benzamides are compounds that are chemically related to metoclopramide and enhance gastrointestinal propulsion.
although first-generation benzamides, including metoclopramide, have potent dopamine d 2 receptor
antagonistic activity, second-generation benzamides,
including  xxxd1708xxx ,  xxxd3097xxx  and zacopride have
only moderate or no affinity for d 2 receptors. alternatively, the predominant properties of second-generation benzamides are 5-hydroxytryptamine ž5-ht. 3

receptor antagonistic and  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonistic
activities w1x. the  xxxg1116xxx  is located exclusively on neural tissues in many organs including the
gastrointestinal tract w2, 3x. it is very unlikely that
the  xxxg1116xxx  antagonism of second-generation benzamides contributes to their gastrointestinal
prokinetic effects except in rodents w4x. this is because selective  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists do not
influence upper gastrointestinal propulsion in humans w5x and dogs w6x, and even inhibit lower intestinal propulsion in humans w7x. the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
has been shown to exist in mammalian gastrointestinal neural plexus, and the activation of this receptor
leads to an enhancement of gastroduodenal as well
as lower intestinal propulsion w8, 9x. it is now thought
that 5ht4 receptor agonism is the main mechanism

which explains the gastrointestinal prokinetic activity of second-generation benzamides in animals and
humans w1x.
the stimulatory effect of second-generation benzamides including  xxxd1708xxx , the most widely applied
gastrointestinal prokinetic benzamide, on lower intestinal propulsion in humans seems to be obscure
w1x, although that on gastroduodenal propulsion has
been established w10x. it is possible that the obscure
effect on lower intestinal propulsion of these benzamides is due to inseparable  xxxg1116xxx  antagonistic and  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonistic activity. the
simultaneous blockade of 5-ht3 receptors may offset the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor-mediated facilitatory effect
on lower intestinal propulsion. it has been demonstrated that selective  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists as
well as  xxxd1708xxx ,  xxxd3097xxx  and zacopride inhibit
lower intestinal propulsion in mice, at least in part,
by their  xxxg1116xxx  antagonistic activity w11x.
based on this evidence, it is thought that secondgeneration benzamides are not ideal for the treatment of impaired lower intestinal propulsion, despite of their established therapeutic benefits for
gastroduodenal dysmotility. at the same time, it is
naturally hypothesised that a gastrointestinal benzamide which has only  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonistic but no
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonistic activity may surpass
second-generation benzamides in stimulating lower
intestinal propulsion.
the results of molecular biology and pharmacological studies strongly indicate that marked differences exist in the structural and functional characteristics of 5-ht3 receptors between humans and
animals although such differences do not seem to
exist within the same species w2, 3x. as for the  xxxg1117xxx 
receptor, there have been a few studies which suggest species differences with respect to agonistic and
antagonistic properties of ligands w12, 13x. very recently, wyngaert et al. w14x cloned the human  xxxg1117xxx 
receptor and showed that there are minor species
differences in structural characteristics of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors between humans and animals. although a
binding assay using human 5-ht3 and  xxxg1117xxx  receptors is relevant for obtaining accurate information
about the potential clinical practicality of ligands in
human beings, binding properties of gastrointestinal
prokinetic benzamides for human 5-ht3 and human
 xxxg1117xxx  receptors have not been known.
in the present study, the binding properties of
 xxxd1708xxx ,  xxxd3097xxx  zacopride and a newly synthesised gastrointestinal prokinetic benzamide ym53389 žq.-ž s .-2-ww3-ž4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxyphenyl.-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-ylxmethylxpiperidine hydrochloride4 žfig. 1. for both cloned human 5-ht3 and

materials and methods

preparation of membranes
isolation of human 5-ht3 receptors and human
 xxxg1117xxx  receptors was performed as described by
miyake et al. w3x and wyngaert et al. w14x, respectively. preparation of membranes was performed as
described below. cos-1 cells ž1]2 = 10 6 cells. were
incubated overnight, exposed to the plasmid dna
ž15 m g. with deae-dextran ž0.25 mg mly1 . for 14 h,
and then exposed to 0.1 mm chloroquine for 2.5 h.
the transfected cells were cultured for 3 days. the
cells were then harvested, homogenised in 50 mm
hepes žph 7.4. buffer and centrifuged at 48,000 g
for 10 min. the pellets were suspended in homogenizing buffer and stored at y808c.

radioligand binding studies
5-ht3 receptors

w 3 hxramosetron, a specific ligand for  xxxg1116xxx  w15x, binding studies were performed as previously described by miyake et al. w3x. membranes
were incubated at 258c for 30 min in 0.5 ml of 50
mm hepes žph 7.4. buffer, containing 0.05 nm
w 3 hxramosetron for the competition studies and
varying concentrations of the radioligand for the
saturation studies. non-specific binding was defined
with 1 m m  xxxd3451xxx .

 xxxg1117xxx  receptors

w 3 hxgr113808 binding studies were performed as
described by wyngaert et al. w14x. membranes were
incubated at 378c for 30 min in 0.5 ml of 50 mm
hepes žph 7.4 . buffer, containing 0.1 n m
w 3 hxgr113808, a specific ligand for  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
w16x, for the competition binding studies and varying
concentrations of the radioligand for the saturation
studies. non-specific binding was defined with 30
m m 5-ht. for all binding studies, the incubation was
terminated by rapid filtration and washing with icecold hepes buffer through gfrb filters using a
brandel cell harvester. radioactivity of the filter

guinea-pig colon
male hartley guinea-pigs žhamri, ibaraki, japan.
weighing 600]950 g supplied colon tissue for the
study. guinea-pigs were killed by cervical dislocation, and a 20-mm segment of descending colon was
excised. each tissue sample was suspended vertically
in a 10-ml organ bath containing krebs-bicarbonate
solution ž118.4 mm nacl, 4.7 mm kcl, 1.2 mm

and aerated with a mixture of 95% o 2 and 5% co 2 .
the tissues were then attached to an isometric
force-displacement transducer žsb-1t, nihon kohden, tokyo, japan. connected to an ink oscillograph
žss-100f, sekonic, tokyo. through a carrier amplifier žap-621g, nihon kohden., placed under a resting tension of 1 g. the tissues were left to equilibrate in krebs-bicarbonate solution for approximately 1 h prior to the start of the experiment.
sub-maximal contractions were first elicited by repeated concentration of 10y5 m 5-ht until constant
responses were obtained. a cumulative concentration-response curve for 5-ht was constructed by
increasing the bath concentration of 5-ht approximately threefold. the tissues were washed three
times with krebs-bicarbonate solution and exposed
to test drugs. the concentration-response curve for
5-ht was repeated 30 min after the exposure to test
drugs. each test drug was examined at a single
concentration in each preparation. all experiments
were performed in the presence of 10y7 m gr
113808 ža selective  xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonist. to
exclude  xxxg1117xxx  receptor-mediated response.

rat oesophagus
male wistar rats žslc, hamamatsu, japan.
weighing 210]280 g supplied oesophagus tissue for
the study. rats were killed by cervical dislocation,
and a 20-min segment of intra-thoracic oesophagus
was excised. the outer longitudinal and circular
muscle layers of the oesophagus were removed, and
the inner segment žtunica muscularis mucosa. was
suspended vertically in a 10-ml organ bath containing krebs-bicarbonate solution warmed to 378c and
aerated with a mixture of 95% o 2 and 5% co 2 . the
tissues were then attached to an isometric force-displacement transducer žsb-1t. connected to an ink
oscillograph žss-100f. through a carrier amplifier
žap-621g., placed under a resting tension of 0.5 g.
the tissues were left to equilibrate in krebs- bicarbonate solution for approximately 1 h prior to the
start of the experiment. after the preparations were
induced to contract with 3 = 10y6 m carbachol, a
cumulative concentration]relaxation response to the

377

test drug was constructed by increasing bath concentrations of the drug approximately threefold. the
tissues were washed three times with krebsbicarbonate solution. they were then exposed to
10y5 m 5-methoxytryptamine to selectively desensitise  xxxg1117xxx  receptor-mediated relaxation w17x. induction of contraction by carbachol and the concentration response curve for the test drug were repeated
30 min after the exposure to 5-methoxytryptamine.
responses were measured as a decrease in isometric
tension and are expressed as percentage relaxation
of the carbachol-induced tone. the difference
between responses in the presence or absence of
5-methoxytryptamine in the same preparation was
defined as the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor-mediated response. a
single test drug was examined in each preparation.

whole gut transit test
male icr mice žslc. weighing 22]28 g were
used in the whole gut transit test as previously
described w11x. mice were deprived of food and
water before the start of the experiment. on the day
of the experiment, each mouse was transferred to an
individual cage žw120 mm= l200 mm= h100 mm.
 xxxd1891xxx :00 h and kept 1 h before the application of
drugs. mice were randomly divided into five groups
žeight animals per group.. carmine, employed as a
marker, was orally administered to each mouse at
0.3 ml ž3 g of carmine in 50 ml of 0.5%  xxxd2609xxx .. mice were then returned to individual cages,
and were placed on a white sheet so as to distinguish
stools coloured by the marker from normal stools.
the time taken for excretion of the head of the
orally administered marker was measured. the endpoint was taken as the first appearance of one
coloured žred. pellet, and the appearance of the
marker was based on visual observation. each mouse
was subcutaneously treated with either the vehicle
or a single dose of test drug at a volume of 10 ml
kgy1 just before administration of marker.

upper gastrointestinal transit test
male icr mice žslc. weighing 24]29 g were
used in the upper gastrointestinal transit test. mice
were randomly divided into five groups žeight animals per group.. after oral administration of 0.3 ml
of marker žas used in the whole gut transit test., the
mouse was returned to the individual cage. at 20
min after the administration of marker, they were
killed by cervical dislocation, the abdomens opened
and the intestines removed from the pyloric junction
to the caecal end. the distance travelled by the head
of the marker and the total length of the intestine
were measured. upper gastrointestinal transit was
expressed as a percentage of the distance travelled
by the head of the marker relative to the total length
of the small intestine. each mouse was subcutaneously treated with either the vehicle or a single

discussion
because the existence of species differences has
been suggested in 5-ht3 w2, 3x and  xxxg1117xxx  receptors
w12, 13x, the binding assay using human 5-ht3 and
human  xxxg1117xxx  receptors other than animal receptors
is relevant to obtain accurate information about the
potential ability of ligands in human tissues. due to
this reason, the binding properties of gastrointestinal benzamides for both cloned human 5-ht3 and
cloned human  xxxg1117xxx  receptors were firstly examined
in the present study.  xxxd3097xxx  and zacopride
showed high affinity for the cloned human 5-ht3
receptor, and  xxxd1708xxx  also had an affinity for this
receptor although its potency was relatively weak.
this result is parallel to previous reports showing

that these benzamides exhibit potent interaction with
5-ht3 receptors in animal tissues w1, 18x. in contrast
to these benzamides, ym-53389 had no affinity for
the cloned  xxxg1116xxx , indicating that this new
compound probably has no interaction with the 5ht3 receptor in human tissues. in accord with data
for animal tissues,  xxxd1708xxx ,  xxxd3097xxx  and zacopride all showed nm order affinities for the cloned
human  xxxg1117xxx  receptor. ym-53389 also showed a
high affinity, which was almost equal to that of
 xxxd1708xxx  and higher than those of  xxxd3097xxx  and
zacopride, indicating that ym-53389 is expected to
potently act on the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor in human tissues.
it has been proved that 5-ht induces a contraction in the colon isolated from guinea-pigs via a
predominantly  xxxg1116xxx -related mechanism

potent  xxxg1116xxx  antagonistic activity. however, ym-53389 did not show an inhibitory effect on

traction by 5-ht at high concentrations. ym-53389
did not show any binding affinity for the cloned
human  xxxg1116xxx  in this study. taken together,
it is likely that ym-53389 has a negligible 5-ht3
receptor antagonistic activity although it has an inhibitory effect by an unknown mechanism on 5htinduced intestinal contraction at high concentrations. in the functional study using the oesophagus,
it was shown that ym-53389 exerts  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
agonistic activity. it was recently reported that the
pec 50 values estimated under the same experimental conditions as present study were 7.4 for  xxxd3097xxx  and 6.5 for zacopride w21x. therefore, the

ym-53389 shortened whole gut transit time in
mice. because ym-53389 did not affect upper gastrointestinal transit at a dose which significantly

site where it enhances propulsive activity is the

tor antagonists reduced 5ht-induced acceleration of
colonic transit in rats. banner et al. w23x found that a
highly selective, in ¨ i¨ o active  xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonist, sb204070, reduced the 5-hydroxytryptophan ža
precursor of 5-ht.-induced increase of faecal output in mice. in the whole gut and upper gastrointestinal transit test in mice, sb204070 prolonged
whole gut transit time but did not affect upper
gastrointestinal transit ždata not shown.. this evidence suggest that  xxxg1117xxx  receptors are involved in
the control of lower intestinal propulsion and that
 xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonists have the potential ability of
enhancing lower intestinal propulsion. it is possible
that the facilitation of lower intestinal propulsion by
ym-53389 is related to  xxxg1117xxx  receptor stimulation.
it has been previously reported that  xxxd1708xxx ,
 xxxd3097xxx  and zacopride in addition to the selective
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonists ramosetron and ondansetron inhibited the lower intestinal propulsion in
mice w11x. although the inhibitory effect of  xxxd1708xxx 
seemed to be mediated not only by  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonism but also by other unknown mechanisms,
that of other compounds seemed to be mediated
almost exclusively through the blockade of 5-ht3
receptors. it is of interest that  xxxd3097xxx  and zacopride delayed lower intestinal propulsion whereas
ym-53389 shortened it, despite the fact that  xxxd3097xxx  and zacopride are more potent than ym-53389
in  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonistic activity w21x. these
phenomena may be explained as follows. the selectivity for the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonistic ¨ s the 5-ht3
receptor antagonistic activity is more essential than
the absolute potency in the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonistic
activity for the stimulation of lower intestinal
propulsion in mice. related to this, it has recently
been found that rs 67506, a benzamide possessing
 xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonistic activity without  xxxg1116xxx  antagonistic activity w24x enhances the lower
intestinal propulsion in mice w21x. furthermore, it
has recently been reported that a  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
agonist, sdz htf 919, which has a slight affinity for
the  xxxg1116xxx , reduces colonic transit time in
mice w25, 26x.
because a  xxxg1116xxx  blockade leads to inhibition of colonic propulsion in humans w7, 27x,
gastrointestinal prokinetic benzamides, at least those
which possess a  xxxg1116xxx  antagonistic action,
do not seem ideal for the treatment of impaired
lower intestinal propulsion.  xxxd1708xxx  is the gastrointestinal prokinetic benzamide used most widely,
but its stimulatory effect on human lower intestinal
propulsion seems weak compared with that on gastroduodenal propulsion w1x. this compound was reported to have a selectivity for the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
¨ s the  xxxg1116xxx , based on binding studies
using animal tissues w28x. however, the present study
was the first to show that  xxxd1708xxx  was not free from
affinity for human 5-ht3 receptors. consequently, it
cannot be dismissed that this affinity is reflected in

the weak clinical action of  xxxd1708xxx  on lower intestinal propulsion. in the present study, ym-53389
showed a unique profile which existing benzamides
did not have, namely, high selectivity for human
 xxxg1117xxx  receptors ¨ s human 5-ht3 receptors. recently, it has been reported that sdz htf 919
facilitated colonic propulsion in mice as well as in
humans w25, 26x. these results suggest the possibility
of a breakthrough in gastrointestinal prokinetic benzamides that show a selectivity for the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonistic ¨ s the  xxxg1116xxx  antagonistic
activity. these compounds may surpass existing benzamides in facilitating lower intestinal propulsion
and in treating impaired lower intestinal propulsion.
this study firstly provided information on binding
properties of gastrointestinal benzamides for both
cloned human 5-ht3 and cloned human  xxxg1117xxx  receptors. it was shown that ym-53389 is selective for
human  xxxg1117xxx  receptors ¨ s human 5-ht3 receptors
although existing gastrointestinal benzamides  xxxd1708xxx , zacopride and  xxxd3097xxx  are non-selective.
it was also shown that ym-53389 acts as an agonist
at  xxxg1117xxx  receptors and has a negligible  xxxg1116xxx  antagonistic activity in animal tissues. the
results in the present study raises the possibility of a
breakthrough that gastrointestinal prokinetic benzamides which are selective for the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
gonistic activity ¨ s  xxxg1116xxx  antagonistic activity may surpass existing benzamides in facilitating
lower intestinal propulsion and benefit patients with
gastrointestinal disorders associated with impair of
intestinal propulsion, such as constipation.
