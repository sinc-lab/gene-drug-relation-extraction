histamine,

brain histamine is localized in both neurons and mast
cells (1-3). it has been suggested that mast cell stores of
histamine contribute significantly to brain histamine lev
els (1 3). evidence also suggests that histamine and other
amines stored and released by mast cells, serve physiolog
ical roles as neuromodulators of brain functions (4-6). it
has been suggested that the central histaminergic system
plays an inhibitory role in convulsions (7 10)
acute morphine treatment is known to increase the
turnover of neuronal histamine (11). moreover, mor
phine's effect on mast cells in the central nervous system
should also be taken into consideration as a target of
morphine action, since it is known to release histamine
from mast cells in peripheral tissues (12, 13); on the other
hand, histamine receptors are known to play important
roles in morphine antinociception and morphine-stimu
lated locomotion (14, 15). it is also suggested that mor
phine has both convulsant and anticonvulsant effects,
depending on the dose, the species, the route of admin
istration and the method (16).

procedure

to estimate the current that produced mes seizure in
half of the animals, mes50, 5 groups of mice (n = 20) were

subjected to electroshock of 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 ma.
various doses of morphine (ranging from 0.001 to 200
mg/kg, i.p.) were tested with mes50 in seven groups of
mice (n=20), and the dose-response curve was obtained.
naloxone, histamine hi-receptor antagonists, dimethin
dene, promethazine and  xxxd2906xxx , and the histamine
h2-receptor antagonist ranitidine were tested with mes50
in different groups of mice (n=20). ranitidine was
injected by the intracerebroventricular
(i.c.v.) route.
under ether anesthesia, a 22 ga. cannula was implant
ed using the following coordinates: 0.8 mm anterior to
bregma, 0.8 mm lateral to midline zero and 3.0 mm
ventral to the skull surface. other drugs were admin
istered intraperitoneally
in a volume of 0.1 ml/ 10 g
body weight. the control group received only 0.1 ml/ 10 g
saline intraperitoneally.
all chemicals were dissolved in
isotonic nacl. the animals were used only once. injec
tions were made 1 hr before the test. all experiments were
carried out during 2:00-5:00 p.m.
drugs

morphine hydrochloride (haver, istanbul, turkey),
 xxxd1894xxx  maleate ( xxxd1894xxx '!~; ciba-ceigy, istanbul,

turkey), promethazine hydrochloride (sigma, st. louis,

zyma, istanbul, turkey) and naloxone hydrochloride

results

calculation of mes50
in different groups of mice subjected to an electroshock
of 30, 40, 50, 60 or 70 ma, the calculated mes50 current
was 50 ma (73.37-56.65 ma).
dose-response relationship of morphine on mes50 seizure
morphine produced a dose-dependent anticonvulsant
effect at low doses and completely protected against mes
seizure at 1 and 50 mg/kg, i.p. (p<0.001) (fig. 1); this
effect was antagonized by naloxone (10 mg/kg, i.p.)
(p<0.001) (table 1). the protective effect of morphine
against mes50 diminished at higher doses (100 and 200
mg/kg, i.p.; p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively) (fig. 1).
effects of h1 and h2-antagonists

promethazine (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.),  xxxd2906xxx  (30 mg/kg,
i.p.) and ranitidine (50,ug, i.c.v.) had no significant effect
on mes seizures (table 1). however, the anticonvulsive
effect of morphine (1 mg/kg, i.p.) was antagonized by
 xxxd1894xxx , promethazine and  xxxd2906xxx  dose-de
pendently (fig. 2, table 1), but not by ranitidine (table
1).

mes50 was calculated by the method of litchfield
wilcoxon (17) using the computer program described by
tallarida and murray (18), and comparisons among the
groups were made by the chi-square
test.

it has been widely reported that morphine has anti
convulsant and proconvulsant effects in various species
depending on the dose, route of administration
and
the method (16). in the present study, we observed that
morphine has a dose-dependent protective effect on mes
seizures at lower doses and that this effect diminishes at
higher doses. the lessening of the anticonvulsant effect at

h2-receptors,

are

known to play important roles in morphine's effects (14,
15). it has been reported that morphine antinociception is
mediated by activation of brain histamine h2-receptors in

rats (14), and morphine-stimulated
locomotion of the
c57bl/6j mouse may be partially mediated by histamine
h2-receptors of the nucleus accumbens (15). morphine
and other opioids with ,u-agonistic activity increase brain
histamine tunover in mice (11, 19). foot shock -induced
enhancement of brain histamine turnover in mice is
mediated partly by activation of opioid-related mecha
nisms (20). our results show that the anticonvulsant effect
of morphine is mediated by histamine h1-receptors, since
h1-antagonists,  xxxd1894xxx , promethazine and phenir
amine, antagonized this effect, but ranitidine did not.
it was reported that i.c.v. histamine injections or en
dogen histamine release in mouse brain exerts anticonvul
sant effect against electrically induced convulsions, which
is antagonized by histamine h1-receptor antagonists, but
not by centrally acting histamine h2-receptor antagonists
(8 10). it has been suggested that elevated brain hista
mine concentration by histidine or  xxxd2628xxx  leads to an
increase of the pentetrazole-induced
seizure threshold
(but not of the electroconvulsive threshold) which is an
tagonized by  xxxd1894xxx  and promethazine (7). on the
contrary, tuomisto and tacke showed that elevation of
brain histamine concentrations
by  xxxd2628xxx  inhibits
maximal hindleg extension after mes and suggested that
histaminergic neurons are involved in mechanisms that
inhibit generalizations of epileptic discharges in rat brain
(21). these reports indicate that the anticonvulsant effect
of morphine may be mediated by activation of brain
histamine h1-receptors.
