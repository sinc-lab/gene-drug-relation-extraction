abstract: the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are diverse group of compounds used for the treatment of
inflammation, since the introduction of  xxxd234xxx  in 1899. traditional (first generation) nsaids exert antiinflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects through the blockade of prostaglandin synthesis via non-selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase (cox-1 and cox-2) isozymes. their use is associated with side effects such as gastrointestinal
and renal toxicity. a number of selective (second generation) cox-2 inhibitors (rofecoxib, celecoxib,  xxxd3481xxx  etc.)
were developed as safer nsaids with improved gastric safety profile. observation of increased cardiovascular risks in
approve (adenomatous polyp prevention on vioxx) study sent tremors and led to voluntary withdrawn of vioxx (rofecoxib) by merck from the market in september 2004 followed by bextra ( xxxd3481xxx ) in 2005 raising a question on the
safety of selective cox-2 inhibitors. this leads to the belief that these effects are mechanism based and may be class effect. however, some studies suggested association of traditional nsaids with similar effects requiring a relook into the
whole class of nsaids rather than simply victimizing the selective cox-2 inhibitors. recognition of new avenues for selective cox-2 inhibitors such as cancer, alzheimer’s disease, parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, major depression,
ischemic brain injury and diabetic peripheral nephropathy has kindled the interest in these compounds. this review highlights the various structural classes of selective cox-2 inhibitors developed during past seven years (2003-2009) with
special emphasis on diaryl-hetero/carbo-cyclic class of compounds. molecular modeling aspects are also briefly discussed.

1. introduction
inflammation is the most important defense mechanism
of an organism. elevated levels of prostaglandins (pgs) are
associated with inflammation and pain. non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids) constitute a diverse group of
compounds that have been primarily used for the treatment
of pain and inflammation. they exert their action by the inhibition of pg biosynthesis (fig. 1). cyclooxygenase (cox)
was identified as the molecular target for nsaids by john
r.vane in 1971 [1].
though the pgs (especially pge2) are responsible for the
inflammatory symptoms, they have cytoprotective effects in
the gastrointestinal tract and also control the renal functions
in kidney [2]. hence, inhibition of pgs by aspirin and other
classical nsaids causes gastric ulceration, bleeding [3] and
renal dysfunction [4]. after the discovery of a second cox
isoform, cox-2 [5], the dual role of prostaglandins as mediators of physiological and pathological functions was clarified. both the isozymes carry out essentially the same catalytic biotransformation of  xxxd208xxx , but differ in their
structure, expression and function [6-8].
the cox-1 is constitutively expressed in most of the tissues and plays an important role in maintaining the homeostasis. on the other hand, cox-2 is inducible which is activated by pro-inflammatory stimuli and is involved in the
inflammatory processes. these findings led to the hypothesis
that the inhibition of cox-1 is associated with the adverse
effects of classical nsaids (fig. 2) whereas inhibition of
cox-2 is responsible for their anti-inflammatory effects
[9,10].

the aggressive explorations in the search of safer selective cox-2 inhibitors lead to the introduction of rofecoxib,
celecoxib,  xxxd3481xxx  and  xxxd2069xxx  (fig. 3). rofecoxib
(vioxx) was withdrawn voluntarily by merck from the market in september 2004 following the increased cardiovascular risks observed in approve (adenomatous polyp prevention on vioxx) study. subsequently the sale of bextra
( xxxd3481xxx ) was also suspended by pfizer in 2005. this
raised a question on the safety of selective cox-2 inhibitors.
however, no increased risk of cardiovascular thrombotic
events was evident in class (celecoxib long term arthritis safety study) trial conducted on celecoxib [11] which is
the only selective cox-2 inhibitor available in u.s. market.
a meta-analysis of published and unpublished tabular data
from randomized trials revealed that selective cox-2 inhibitors and traditional nsaids (high dose regimens of ibuprofen and diclofenac) have similar incidence of adverse cardiovascular events [12]. various studies suggest that the cardiovascular toxicity associated with the use of selective
cox-2 inhibitors might be dependent on the dose as well as
on the duration of treatment [13-16].
the mechanism underlying the adverse cardiovascular effects associated with the use of cox inhibitors is due to an
imbalance between cox-1 derived thrombotic thromboxane
a2 (txa2) in platelets and cox-2 derived vasoprotective
prostacyclin (pgi2) in endothelium [11]. there should be
>95% suppression of the platelet cox-1 before it can be
translated into clinically relevant platelet inhibition [17]. all
nsaids significantly inhibit cox-2 at therapeutic dose but
only few traditional nsaids (aspirin and naproxen) are able
to show >95% suppression of the platelet cox-1 at such
dose. this explains why selective cox-2 inhibitors as well
as traditional nsaids show adverse cardiovascular effects
[18].

side effects in target (therapeutic arthritis research and
gastrointestinal event trial) [20]. however, reports of serious hepatic side effects associated with use of  xxxd2517xxx ,
resulted in its withdrawal from australian market followed
by european market. in a recent study,  xxxd2517xxx  elicited

similar cox-2 inhibitory profile at 50, 100, and 200 mg and
indeed was found to completely inhibit cox-2 at 50 mg

be used to avoid hepatic side effects? this emphasizes the
need for dose-dependent clinical study of selective cox-2

thereby minimizing the side effects and their renaissance as
anti-inflammatory agents [22,23].
inflammation has been suggested as a new hallmark of
cancer [24]. cox-2 expression is upregulated in several human cancers [25] suggesting that it plays an important role in
pathophysiology of various cancers such as lung [26], breast
[27], colorectal [28], genitourinary [29] and cervical [30].

celecoxib has been approved by fda (food and drug administration) as an adjunct for the treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis (fap) [31]. in a recent case report, a
patient with attenuated fap on long-term treatment with
selective cox-2 inhibitors (rofecoxib and subsequently
celecoxib) showed no evidence of progression of polyposis
or development of colorectal cancer after nine-years of fol-

low-up [32]. moreover, during the follow-up period, no adverse effects of the drug were reported.
alzheimer's disease (ad), a neurodegenerative disorder,
is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. epidemiological studies show that the long-term use of nsaids
is associated with reduced risk of developing ad and delaying its onset [33]. it has been postulated that beneficial effects of non-selective and selective nsaids in ad might be
due to anti-inflammatory (inhibition of cox) or antiamyloidogenic or synergistic mechanisms [34]. however,
clinical trials with non-selective nsaids and selective
cox-2 inhibitors on ad have failed to show any beneficial
effect on progression of ad [35]. recent finding suggests
that cox-2 plays a role in oxidative stress in ad and rofecoxib may be beneficial in ad management through reduction of ad-related oxidative stress [36]. further studies
need to be undertaken on selective cox-2 inhibitors to unfold their exact mechanism of action in the prevention or
delay of onset of ad.
parkinson’s disease (pd) is a neurodegenerative disorder.
inflammatory processes are involved in the pathogenesis of
pd as cox-2 expression was found to be up-regulated in
brain dopaminergic neurons of various experimental models
of pd [37]. data from several experimental and epidemiological studies revealed that nsaids including preferential
cox-2 inhibitors have neuroprotective effects on the pathogenesis of pd and may be useful in delaying the onset and
slowing down the progression of the disease [38]. further
animal experiments and clinical trials with selective cox-2
inhibitors are required to clarify their neuroprotective role in
the pathogenesis of pd.
up-regulation of cox-2 expression has also been implicated with a number of other pathophysiological conditions
such as schizophrenia and major depression [39], epilepsy
[40], ischemic brain injury [41], diabetic peripheral nephropathy [42] etc. cox-2 has been identified as therapeutic
target by researchers to intervene with various disease conditions, indicating that the future of selective cox-2 inhibitors
is not limited to management of inflammation and pain; new
therapeutic avenues are emerging where they can play a vital
role.
 xxxd2738xxx  (no) has a significant role in the cytoprotection of gastric mucosa. hybrid molecules comprising of
nsaid and  xxxd2738xxx  donor moieties have reduced gastrointestinal and cardiovascular toxicity compared to selective
and non-selective cox inhibitors [43].
the detailed aspects related to the biology of cox
isozymes [44-50] and a number of previously developed
classes of selective cox-2 inhibitors are described in some
of the excellent reviews [51-56]. this review will highlight
the recent developments in diverse structural classes of selective cox-2 inhibitors with brief discussion on molecular
modeling studies.
2. recent advancements in the development of selective cox-2 inhibitors
over a decade, a large number of selective cox-2 inhibitors with diverse chemical characteristics have been designed
but only a few have emerged as drugs (fig. 3). the proto-

chakraborti et al.

typical cox-2 inhibitors ns-398 (10) and dup-697 (14) led
to the development of methanesulfoanilides (sulides) [57]
and diaryl heterocycle (coxibs) [58] class of selective cox-2
inhibitors respectively.
2.1. analog based approaches
these include either a novel class or a previously developed class on which various chemical modifications have
been performed. since, major advancements have occurred
in the field of diaryl hetero/carbo-cyclic class of compounds,
the focus will be first on this class followed by others.
a. diaryl hetero/carbo-cyclics
several series of selective cox-2 inhibitors belonging to
the 1,2-diaryl class of compounds containing different heterocyclic and carbocyclic moieties as a central scaffold have
been developed.
furans
diarylfuranone derivatives have been extensively investigated as selective cox-2 inhibitors [59] and the blockbuster drug rofecoxib (16) belongs to this class containing
the basic structural framework of 3,4-diarylfuranone [60].
since then this molecular fragment has been the target of
continuous efforts in designing new chemical entities as selective cox-2 inhibitors.
shin et al. reported a novel series of 5-aryl-2,2-dialkyl-4phenyl-3(2h)furanone derivatives with improved gastric
safety profiles [61]. methyl sulfone derivative 28 with paran-butyl substituent on the 4-phenyl ring (table 1) exhibited
very high selectivity comparable to rofecoxib (cox-2, ic50
= 0.06 m; si > 1667). replacement of the methyl sulfone
moiety with sulfonamide decreased selectivity but improved
the inhibitory potency. sulfonamide derivative 29 with metafluoro substituent on 4-phenyl ring is one of the most potent
cox-2 inhibitor (ed50 = 0.1 mg/kg/day) ever reported [even
more potent than rofecoxib (ed50 = 0.74 mg/kg/day) and
 xxxd2069xxx  (ed50 = 0.7 mg/kg/day)] in adjuvant-induced arthritis animal model.
in order to ascertain the effect of linking the furanone
ring to the phenyl group of the diarylfuranone, pal et al. synthesized conformationally restricted 3,4-diarylfuranones
(naphthofuranones) [62] and observed that the naphthofuranone derivative 30 (table 1) exhibited cox-2 inhibitory
potency comparable to rofecoxib (cox-2, ic50 = 0.329 m;
si > 1519). restricted conformation was found to be a prerequisite for cox-2 inhibition in case of methanesulfonyl
derivatives as freely rotating analog 31 of 30 was found to be
inactive (table 1).
introduction of a hydroxyl group into the 5-position of
the 3,4-diarylfuranone system resulted in highly selective
cox-2 inhibitors which can be easily converted into their
water soluble open chain sodium salts under basic conditions
making them suitable for intravenous formulation [63].
however, hydroxyl-substituted compounds were found to be
less potent than their alkoxy analogs. the compound 32 with
4-chlorophenyl substitution (table 1) emerged as a highly
potent cox-2 inhibitor with in vivo anti-inflammatory activity (ed50 = 1.4 mg/kg) comparable to rofecoxib (ed50 = 1.5
mg/kg) in carrageenan-induced rat paw edema assay.

ited higher potency and selectivity than rofecoxib (cox-2,
ic50 = 0.43 m; si > 1162).
anticipating that adverse cardiovascular effects of rofecoxib might be due to its higher cox-2 selectivity, knaus
et al. modified the rofecoxib template [65] by replacement of
its so2 me group with meso2nh moiety of  xxxd2727xxx  in
order to reduce its cox-2 selectivity. replacement of the
so2me group with meso2nh moiety in general resulted in
compounds with decreased cox-2 potency and selectivity
and 34 possessing a methyl group at para position of c-3
phenyl ring (table 1) emerged as the most promising compound with reduced selectivity than rofecoxib (cox-2,
ic50 = 0.5 m; si > 200).
pyrroles
biava et al. extensively studied 1,5-diarylpyrroles by
varying the substitution at 3-position of the pyrrole ring.
various substitutions such as acetic acid and its esters
[66,67], ethers [68], -hydroxy/alkoxy esters [69] were tried,
amongst them the ester derivatives were more potent and
selective cox-2 inhibitors and 35 exhibited potency comparable to celecoxib (cox-2, ic50 = 0.079 m; si = 64.5) and
selectivity better than rofecoxib (cox-2, ic50 = 0.012 m;
si >800) (table 2).
pyrazoles
since celecoxib (17) belongs to 1,5-diarylpyrazole class
of selective cox-2 inhibitors, much attention was paid to
this class of compounds [70]. pal et al. reported a series of
1,5-diarylpyrazoles with benzenesulfonamide moiety [71]. in
this series, 39 exhibited good in vitro inhibitory potency with
selectivity better than celecoxib (cox-2, ic50 = 0.07 m;
si = 219) (table 3) and its sodium salt showed good in vivo
anti-inflammatory activity (ed50 = 6.0 mg/kg). replacement
of the benzenesulfonamide group with fused heterocycles
resulted in cox-1 selective compounds whereas polar substitutions such as hydroxyalkyl/acylaminoalkyl on n-1 benzenesulfonamide ring increased the cox-2 selectivity [72].
hydroxymethyl derivative 40 was most selective (table 3)
with less potency than celecoxib (cox-2, ic50 = 0.036 m).

repositioning of sulfonamide group from n-1 phenyl ring to
c-5 phenyl ring resulted in compounds with improved
potency and selectivity [73] and 41 (table 3) exhibited
potency and selectivity comparable to celecoxib (cox-2,
ic50 = 0.036 m).
recently, szabo et al. synthesized a new series of 1,5diarylpyrazoles containing benzenesulfonamide moiety as
anti-inflammatory agents [74]. none of these compounds
showed in vitro cox-1/cox-2 inhibitory activity  xxxd1891xxx  m
concentration but interestingly in vivo studies using carrageenan-induced rat paw edema assay identified 42
(ed30 = 5.7 mg/kg) as better anti-inflammatory agent than
celecoxib (ed30 = 23 mg/kg) (fig. 4).
ranatunge et al. [75] synthesized three novel series of bicyclic-pyrazoles (pyrazolo[5,1-b]1,3-oxazolidines, pyrazolo[5,1-b]1,3-oxazines and imidazolidino[1,2-d]pyrazoles)
by activation of hydroxyalkyl group attached to the  xxxd3045xxx 
ring with subsequent cyclization and 43 was identified as the
most promising compound with potency comparable to celecoxib (cox-2, ic50 = 1.2 m) (table 3).
several novel series of 2,3-diaryl-pyrazolo[5,1-b]pyridazines [76], pyrazolo[4,3-c]quinoline-4-ones [77] and
3-(2-methoxytetrahydrofuran-2-yl)pyrazoles [78] have also
been reported as selective cox-2 inhibitors with compounds
gw40681 (44), 45, and 46 respectively were the best from
each series (table 3).
imidazoles
heterocyclic compounds with vicinal diaryl substitution
having imidazole ring as central scaffold have been investigated earlier as selective cox-2 inhibitors [79,80]. almansa
et al. reported a new series of 1,5-diarylimidazoles [81]. the
structure-activity relationship (sar) studies of two regioisomeric imidazoles, 1-methylsulfonylimidazole and 5methylsulfonylimidazole resulted in identification of 47 as
more potent and selective inhibitor than celecoxib (cox-2,
ic50 = 0.079 m) (table 4) exhibited high potency in various in vivo inflammation tests (carrageenan-induced rat paw
edema test, air pouch model and hyperalgesia test).

recently, navidpour et al. described a new series of 2alkylthio substituted 1,5-diarylimidazoles [82]. the cox-2
selectivity and potency was governed by steric properties of
the 2-alkylthio substituent as well as electronic properties of
the para-substituent of 1-phenyl ring. the compound 48
exhibited cox-2 potency comparable to celecoxib (cox-2,

progress in cox-2 inhibitors

gadad et al. reported a novel class of 2-trifluoromethyl/
sulfonamido-5,6-diaryl substituted imidazo[2,1-b]1,3,4thiadiazoles [83] and observed that 49 and 50 exhibited potent cox-2 inhibitory activities (table 4) but were inferior
to celecoxib (cox-2, ic50 = 0.04 m). however, these
compounds exhibited good in vivo anti-inflammatory activity
comparable to celecoxib in carrageenan-induced rat paw
edema assay.
oxazoles
the in vitro cox inhibitory activities of a new series of
4,5-diphenyloxazolone derivatives [84] were found to be
discouraging and only 51 exhibited noticeable cox-2 selectivity (table 4).
thaizoles
in the novel series of 2,3-diaryl-1,3-thiazolidine-4-ones
possessing methylsulfonyl moiety [85], 52 emerged as most
selective and potent cox-2 inhibitor with selectivity higher
than celecoxib (cox-2, ic50 = 0.06 m; si > 403) (table 4).
oxadiazoles
knaus et al. [86] isosterically replaced the 2-(5h)furanone central ring present in rofecoxib with 1,2,5-oxadiazole2-oxide projecting 3,4-diphenyl-1,2,5-oxadiaz-ole-2-oxides
as hybrid cox-2 inhibitor/ xxxd2738xxx  (no) donor agents.
the compound 53, a hybrid of methanesulfonyl regioisomers
and 54, a hybrid of aminosulfonyl regioisomers exhibited
good in vitro cox-2 inhibitory potency and selectivity but
were inferior to celecoxib (cox-2, ic50 = 0.07 m; si =
472) (table 4).
triazoles
navidpour et al. [87] reported that in the newly designed
3-thio/alkylthio substituted-4,5-diaryl-4h-1,2,4-triazoles, the
alkylthio analog 55 was more potent and selective inhibitor
than celecoxib (cox-2, ic50 = 2.2 m; si = 1.68) (table 4)
and also exhibited good in vivo anti-inflammatory activity
compared to celecoxib in a carrageenan-induced rat paw
edema assay.
pyrans
joo et al. reported a new series of 2,3-diarylbenzopyrans
[88]. derivatives bearing a halogen atom on the 3-aryl ring
showed improved cox-2 potency, e.g., 56 exhibited potency
comparable to celecoxib (cox-2, ic50 = 0.01 m) (table 5).
however, it was ineffective in carrageenan-induced rat paw
edema assay indicating its poor bioavailability due to the
presence of three lipophilic aromatic rings. an approach of
replacing 3-aryl ring with pyridine ring afforded 57 with
improved bioavailability, but also led to decreased potency
(table 5). further approach of truncating the benzopyran
scaffold to -pyrone resulted in compounds with weaker
cox-2 inhibitory activities than celecoxib (cox-2,
ic50 = 0.01 m) [89]. the compound 58 with 3,4-difluoro
substitution exhibited oral in vivo anti-inflammatory activity
comparable to celecoxib in carrageenan-induced rat paw
edema assay. replacement of the 3-phenyl group in the pyrone series with 3-pyridyl moiety (59) resulted in significant reduction of cox-2 inhibitory activity along the lines of
the earlier observations with benzopyran scaffold containing
cox-2 inhibitors [88].

catrula et al. reported 2-phenylpyran-4-ones as a new
class of orally active cox-2 inhibitors [90]. exploration of
various substitutions at 3-position of 2-phenylpyran-4-one
scaffold led to identification of 3-phenoxypyran-4-ones as
potent and selective cox-2 inhibitors. halogen substitution
on 3-phenoxy ring further enhanced the cox-2 activity and
selectivity. the para-chloro derivative 60 emerged as the
most selective compound of this series exhibiting five-fold
cox-2 si compared to  xxxd2069xxx  (cox-2, ic50 = 0.81 m;
si = 122) (table 5). the dihalo substitution on the 3phenoxy ring resulted in further increase in potency.
difluoro substituted compound 61 was most potent cox-2
inhibitor (table 5) and exhibited potency (ed50 = 0.015
mg/kg) higher than that of rofecoxib (ed50 = 0.300 mg/kg)
and  xxxd2069xxx  (ed50 = 0.440 mg/kg) in adjuvant-induced
arthritis model.
rao et al. designed a group of 6-alkyl/alkoxy/alkylthiosubstituted
3-(4-methanesulfonylphenyl)-4-aryl-pyran-2ones [91] and 62, 63 and 64 from c-6 alkyl, alkoxy and alkylthio series respectively were identified as highly potent
and selective cox-2 inhibitors (table 5). although 62 exhibited excellent in vitro cox-2 selectivity even higher than
celecoxib (cox-2, ic50 = 0.057 m; si >401) and rofecoxib
(cox-2, ic50 = 0.43 m; si >1162) yet it demonstrated only
weak in vivo anti-inflammatory activity suggesting more
susceptibility of alkylthio group to metabolic inactivation as
compared to c-6 alkyl/alkoxy analogs when administered
orally. they further designed 6-phenyl substituted 3-(4methanesulfonylphenyl)-4-aryl-pyran-2-ones [92], 65 exhibited potency and selectivity better than that of celecoxib
(cox-2, ic50 = 0.07 m; si = 474) and rofecoxib (cox-2,
ic50 = 0.50 m; si >200) (table 5) along with potent oral in
vivo anti-inflammatory activity (id50 = 5.6 mg/kg) than celecoxib (id50 = 10.8 mg/kg) in carrageenan-induced rat paw
edema assay.
indoles
indole ring present in classical nsaid indomethacin (6)
constitutes an important scaffold for the design of selective
cox-2 inhibitors. a new series of substituted 2sulfonyphenyl-3-phenylindoles was reported by hu et al.
[93]. most of the compounds exhibited in vitro cox-2 inhibitory potency and selectivity higher than celecoxib (cox2, ic50 = 0.52 m), 66 exhibiting higher potency and selectivity than celecoxib both in vitro and in vivo. they further
reported 2-phenyl-3-sulfonylphenyl-indoles, the regioisomeric analogs of the above series [94], 67 and 68 emerged as
the most promising compounds exhibiting potency and selectivity higher than celecoxib (table 6).
campbell et al. reported a series of 6-methylsulfonylindoles [95]. the conformationally more rigid analogs
(3-aroyl/sulfinyl/sulfonyl) were although selective but less
potent than conformationally flexible analogs (3arylmethyl/aryloxy/arylthio). the analog 69 with 3-aryloxy
substitution displayed good in vitro cox-2 inhibitory potency and selectivity (table 6) and also exhibited reasonable
in vivo efficacy in rat carrageenan air pouch model.
pyrazines and quinoxalines
singh et al. reported series of 2,3-diarylpyrazines and
2,3-diarylquinoxalines having methylsulfone/sulfonamide

selective (table 7) and was converted to the water soluble
sodium salt 71 in order to have a better drug candidate for
animal studies. both exhibited in vivo anti-inflammatory

mined the cox-2 inhibitory potency and selectivity, n-hexyl
substituted compound 79 exhibited reasonable potency and
selectivity compared to reference standard celecoxib (cox2, ic50 = 0.07 m; si = 472) (table 8).
knaus et al. also reported a novel series of (e)-2-(aryl)-3(4-methanesulfonylphenyl)acrylic ester prodrugs as hybrid
no releasing anti-inflammatory agents [102]. the hybrid
compounds were potent in vitro inhibitors of cox-2 and
released significant amount of no when incubated in rat
serum. the compound 80 was identified as most potent and
selective cox-2 inhibitor (table 8) with good no releasing
ability but was found less promising than celecoxib (cox-2,
ic50 = 0.07 m; si = 473) and rofecoxib (cox-2, ic50 =
0.50 m; si >200). they recently reported a novel series of
(e)-2-(aryl)-3-(4-methanesulfonylphenyl)acrylic acid prodrugs containing o2-acetoxymethyl-1-(n-ethyl-n-methylamino)diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate and nitrooxyethyl no donor
ester moiety [103]. hybrid nitrooxyethyl ester prodrugs exhibited moderate to high cox-2 inhibitory activities with 81
showing the best cox-2 si (table 8).

1,1,2-triarylethenes
new classes of acyclic triaryl olefins devoid of traditional central heterocyclic or carbocyclic ring scaffold have
been developed [104-107]. in a series of triaryl (z)-olefins,
cox-2 inhibitory potency and selectivity increased considerably with the increase in 2-alkyl chain length (up to 4 carbons) [104]. n-butyl substituted compound 82 exhibited excellent potency and selectivity better than celecoxib (cox-2,
ic50 = 0.057 m; si = 403) (table 9).
introduction of para-acetoxy substituent on c-1 phenyl

(z)-1-(4-acetoxyphenyl)-1-phenyl-2-(4methylsulfonylphenyl)but-1-ene (83) as potent and selective

activity (id50 = 4.1 mg/kg) superior to celecoxib (id50 = 10.8
mg/kg) in carrageenan-induced rat paw edema assay [105].
from a series of 2-alkyl-1,1,2-triaryl (z)-olefins possessing para-meso2nh/n3 as cox-2 pharmacophoric feature
on the c-1 phenyl ring [106], 84 and 85 were the best exhibiting potency comparable to celecoxib (cox-2, ic50 = 0.07

m) and selectivity better than celecoxib (cox-2, si = 472)
(table 9). they also exhibited superior in vivo antiinflammatory activity [84 (id50 = 2.8 mg/kg); 85 (id50 = 5.0
mg/kg)] than celecoxib (id50 = 10.8 mg/kg) in carrageenaninduced rat paw edema assay.
a series of 1,1,2-triaryl (e)-ethenes having paramethylsulfonyl moiety on the c-1 phenyl ring exhibited
good cox-2 inhibitory potency and selectivity [107]. substitution at the c-2 phenyl ring with 4-fluoro substituent afforded 86 with better inhibitory potency and selectivity than
celecoxib (cox-2, ic50 = 0.07 m; si = 472) (table 9).
c. acetylenes
knaus et al. designed a novel class of phenylacetylenes
in order to determine the effect of the replacement of the
double bond of acyclic olefinic compounds by linear acetylene on the cox-2 selectivity and in vivo anti-inflammatory
activity [108]. the sar data revealed that cox-2 inhibitory
potency and selectivity was dependent upon the position of
so2me group on c-1 phenyl ring as well as upon the nature
and position of c-2 phenyl substituent. the compound 87
emerged as potent and selective cox-2 inhibitor (table 10)
compared to rofecoxib (cox-2, ic50 = 0.50 m; si >200)
but was found to be inferior to celecoxib both in terms of
potency and selectivity (cox-2, ic50 = 0.07 m; si = 472).

the in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of 87 was quite discouraging (ed50 = 129.3 mg/kg) compared to celecoxib
(ed50 = 10.8 mg/kg) in carrageenan-induced rat paw edema
assay. a new series of phenylacetylenes designed by replacement of ‘so2me’ with ‘so2nh2’ was reported by the
same group [109]. surprisingly, so2nh2 derivatives were
less potent and selective than earlier reported so2 me derivatives [108]. the analog 88 exhibited the best cox-2 inhibitory potency and selectivity (table 10) but displayed inferior
in vivo anti-inflammatory activity than celecoxib in a carrageenan-induced rat paw edema assay.
recently, knaus et al. reported a class of regioisomeric
1-(phenyl)-2-(pyridyl)acetylenes by bioisosteric replacement
of one of the phenyl ring of 1,2-diphenylacetylene with
pyridyl ring [110] and 89 and 90 emerged as most potent and
selective cox-2 inhibitors (table 10). these compounds
were less potent for in vivo anti-inflammatory activity [89
(id50 = 76.4 mg/kg); 90 (id50 = 59.9 mg/kg)] compared to
celecoxib (id50 = 10.8 mg/kg) in carrageenan-induced rat
paw edema assay.
d. modifications of classical nsaids

cox-2 inhibitors by functional group modifications of wellknown classical nsaids. these include modifications of

[114], indomethacin (6) [115-119], and meclofenamic acid
(8) [120]. modification of the carboxylic acid moiety of indomethacin to esters or amides resulted in compounds with
increased cox-2 selectivity as well as potency [117]. however, it was anticipated that these esters and possibly some
amides may undergo hydrolysis in vivo. therefore, the synthesis of ‘reverse’ esters 91 and ‘reverse’ amides 92 of indomethacin were synthesized (fig. 7) to retain the selectivity
as well as potency [121].

khanna et al. have recently described modifications of
indomethacin leading to selective cox-2 inhibitors in which
the acid moiety has been converted to n-substituted glycolamide ester [122]. the compound 93 with n-morpholinyl
substituent was most potent inhibitor compared to celecoxib
(cox-2, ic50 = 0.07 m; si ~ 219). it also exhibited in vivo
anti-inflammatory activity (ed50 = 5.3 mg/kg) better than
celecoxib (ed50 = 7.9 mg/kg) in carrageenan-induced rat
paw edema assay (fig. 8).

the n-acetyl-2-carboxybenzesulfonamides were synthesized by isosteric replacement of acetoxy group of aspirin by

and it was observed that 95 and 96 were potent and selective
cox-2 inhibitors. the compound 96 was less potent but
more selective inhibitor than celecoxib (cox-2, ic50 = 0.07
m; si ~ 472), whereas 94 exhibited better in vivo antiinflammatory activity (ed50 = 49 mg/kg) than 95 (ed50 = 91
mg/kg) in a carrageenan-induced rat paw edema assay although the latter was more potent and selective inhibitor of
cox-2 in vitro.

incorporation of one-carbon spacer group (methylene/carbonyl/methylidene) between central benzo-1,3dioxolane ring and cycloalkyl or aryl substituent provided
additional flexibility and resulted in more potent and selective inhibitors and 97 was identified as a potent and selective
inhibitor with potency comparable to celecoxib (cox-2,
ic50 = 1.2 m) (fig. 10). due to poor oral in vivo antiinflammatory activity of 97 in air pouch model of inflammation, pyridyl ring was explored as the central scaffold in an
attempt to enhance its bioavailability [125]. the compound
98 was identified as potent and selective inhibitor with in
vivo anti-inflammatory activity comparable to  xxxd2069xxx  in
rat carrageenan-induced air pouch inflammation model (fig.
11).

paramashivappa et al. [126] synthesized a new series of
benzimidazoles, benzothiazoles, and benzoxazoles from
anacardic acid (fig. 12), 99 and 100 were more selective but
less potent inhibitors than rofecoxib (cox-2, ic50 = 0.057
m; si = 200) in hwb assay.

analysis of structural features of selective cox-2 inhibitors

(108)

considering the structural diversity of reported selective
cox-2 inhibitors it seems impossible to generalize the
common structural features present in them. however, a
scrupulous analysis of the majority of compounds investigated as selective cox-2 inhibitors suggests the presence of
vicinal diaryl/arylheteroaryl rings on the central heterocyclic/carbocyclic/acyclic scaffold (with one of the aryl rings
substituted with 4-methylsulfonyl/sulfonamide moiety and
the other aryl/heteroaryl ring bearing a halogen atom/small
lipophilic group) as a basic template for exhibiting good
cox-2 selectivity and potency (fig. 21). in general, the
presence of methylsulfonyl group was attributed to increased
selectivity but decreased cox-2 potency compared to sulfonamide group.

2.2. molecular modeling based approaches
the advent of three-dimensional structures of cox-1 and
cox-2 isozymes with the substrate and inhibitors provide
rationale for cox-2 specificity of the selective inhibitors
[137-141]. both the isozymes are homodimeric proteins.
apart from the catalytic center, acylation site, ionic binding
and h-bonding domain present in both cox-1 and cox-2
active site, there is a side pocket adjacent to the central channel in cox-2 active site which is generated due to the
replacement of ile 523 in cox-1 by the smaller val 523
(fig. 22). the other key difference in cox-1 and cox-2

active site is the mutation of his 513 in cox-1 by arg 513
in cox-2 (sulfonyl and sulfonamidic nsaids interact with
this residue). these differences provide the basis for selectivity of cox inhibition.
a. qsar studies: an overview
diverse classes of compounds such as flavones, and diaryl hetero/carbo-cycles have been focused for the design of
new selective cox-2 inhibitors. extensive efforts have been
made to find out the important pharmacophoric features required for the selective inhibition of cox-2 using the feasible and available molecular modeling methods of drug de-

signing. there are some excellent reviews on quantitative
structure-activity relationship (qsar) studies performed on
cox inhibitors [142-144].
chaturvedi et al. [145] performed a qsar analysis on 26
compounds of 2,3-diaryl benzopyran series 113 which were
already reported as selective cox-2 inhibitors (fig. 23).
qsar models developed in the study showed good predictive ability. qsar analysis suggested that the sulfur atom at
position x is important for enhancing the activity and bulkier
r1, x, r2 and r3 interacting groups were not tolerated at
cox-2 receptor site. they also created a pharmacophore
query employing pharmacophore query editor of molecular
operating environment (moe) and identified two aromatic
probes, an acceptor probe and a sulfonyl probe as the important pharmacophoric structural features of the cox-2 selective ligands. chaturvedi et al. also carried out a qsar study
on a series of 43 diaryl furanones 114 using moe [146]. the
qsar models gave good correlations of physical property,
connectivity and conformation of the molecule with selective
cox-2 inhibitory activity.

another qsar analysis [147] based on classical hansch
approach using conventional two-dimentional descriptors on
two series [series-1: 3-phenoxypyran-4-ones (115) and 3phenylpyran-4-ones (116); series-2: 5-halo-2-phenylpyran
derivatives (117)] of total 54 molecules illustrated the effect
of hydrophobic and electronic interactions primarily responsible for cox-2 binding (fig. 24). for instance, 2-fluoro
substituent on 3-phenoxypyran-4-ones, 4-fluoro substituent
on 3-phenylpyran-4-ones and a bulkier hydrophobic ring
substituent like biphenyl on series-2 seem to improve cox-2
inhibition. this qsar model was explored for selective
inhibition of cox-2 over cox-1 and showed that selectivity
could be influenced by the size and lipophilicity of substituents.

in continuation of finding the important parameters for
the selective cox-2 inhibition, statistically significant
qsar models were derived [148] on the series of 15 conformationally restricted 1,5-diaryl pyrazoles (118) using correlation analysis of conformationally dependent and independent descriptors. geometries of the compounds were optimized using semi-empirical austin model 1 (am1) and
wang-ford charges on non-hydrogen common atoms were
calculated (fig. 25). wang-ford charges calculated suggest
that substitution at c-7 position is important in determining
the cox-1 selectivity whereas substitution at c-8 influences
cox-2 selectivity.
3d-qsar studies on diarylheterocycles and diarylcarbocycles have been carried out by various research groups
[149-153]. a combination of ligand-based and structurebased 3d-qsar study was attempted on 88 molecules [154]
belonging to three chemical classes [triaryl rings (119), diaryl cycloalkanopyrazoles (120), and diphenyl hydrazides
(121)] using comparative molecular field analysis
(comfa), comparative molecular similarity index analysis
(comsia) and molecular docking (fig. 26). the qsar
models came out with statistically significant r2cv (crossvalidated correlation) values. charmm program was used
to carry out the flexible docking into active site in continuum
solvation environment. a good correlation of binding energies with inhibitory activities was observed for all the three
chemical classes using the least-squares fit method.
terphenyl methyl sulfones and sulfonamides (fig. 27)
have also been studied for the development of statistically
acceptable qsar models [155] to explore the selectivity
requirements for cox-2 versus cox-1 binding using electro-topological (e-state: an atom level descriptor) state index. the final analysis from the derived model suggested
three important sites: a (methylsulfone or sulfonamide moiety), b (central phenyl ring), and c (terminal phenyl ring
containing different substituents). all three sites play an important role in cox-2 binding whereas for cox-1 binding
sites b and c are important. only site c is important for
cox-2 selectivity.
molecular docking of structurally diverse 82 cox1/cox-2 inhibitors were performed in this laboratory using
flexx program in order to differentiate between the active
and inactive compounds based on the docking score [156].
encouraging results were obtained that could be useful in
building structure-based 3-d qsar models.

though most of the cox-2 inhibitors contain sulfonyl
moiety, recently reported cox-2 inhibitors devoid of sulfonyl group [157,158] encouraged us to search for new
pharmacophoric requirements for selective cox-2 inhibitory
activity and further designing of the molecules. comfa and
comsia models were developed on a series of 35 molecules
of 1,3-diaryl isoindoles (fig. 28) in this laboratory [159]. an
improved comfa model was obtained (r2cv = 0.536,
r2conv = 0.968, r2pred = 0.6564) by taking into account the
cmr as additional descriptor.
3d-qsar models for 34 molecules of 1,5-diaryl pyrazoles have been derived in this laboratory using two different
alignment methods (atom based alignment method and
alignment method involving the docked conformations) to
find out the importance of alignment of molecules in deriv-

chavatte et al. [161] synthesized 5 molecules (122-126)
designed on the basis of 3d-qsar study [150] that could be
considered as new leads for chemical optimization (table
11).
another successful example of molecular modeling
based designing and synthesis was reported by palomer et al.
[162]. a pharmacophore model was developed using threedimentional structure of four selective cox-2 inhibitors (15,
16, 127 and 128) (fig. 29). sulfonyl s atom (characteristic of
phenylsulfonyl tricyclic compounds), aromatic ring a (normal to plane a), aromatic ring b (plane b), dihedral angles
(angle between the two planes) and excluded volume were
the five important characteristic features of the pharmacophore model. the model was then applied for the design
and synthesis of n-benzyl/benzoyl-5-sulfonylindole analogs
of indomethacin as selective cox-2 inhibitors. compound
129 emerged as a potent and selective cox-2 inhibitor (in
vitro and in vivo evaluation) that could be taken for further
lead optimization.
a set of potential cox-2 pharmacophoric points (planar
hydrophobic and h-bond acceptors) were obtained (fig. 30)
after extracting and visualizing the important features using
support vector machines (svm) [163]. interestingly, the
developed pharmacophore was in accordance with the pharmacophore developed by palomer et al. [162]. in the study,
svm identified the promising screening candidates and predicted their activities which were tested for cox-2 inhibitory activity, benzimidazole derivative 130 showed higher
potency than rofecoxib 16 and celecoxib 17 in cellular activity assay and was considered as a lead molecule.
bijev group [164] performed 3d-qsar (comfa and
comsia) modeling studies for in vitro and in vivo prediction of anti-inflammatory activities. based on the prediction
of 3d-qsar models they synthesized nine derivatives of npyrrolylcarboxylic acid (131-139) which were tested for in
vivo anti-inflammatory activity. six compounds were found
to be active (table 12).
3. conclusions
the journey of selective cox-2 inhibitors begun in early
1990’s with the identification of second isoform of cox
enzyme (cox-2) which was thought to be responsible for
inflammation. this gave the impetus for the search of selective cox-2 inhibitors as safer nsaids. extensive libraries
of compounds with diverse structural features were investigated for selective cox-2 inhibition. the main emphasis

within a decade various selective cox-2 inhibitors (rofecoxib, celecoxib,  xxxd3481xxx ,  xxxd2069xxx  etc.) belonging to
this class were in the market and became blockbuster drugs.
this lead to a notion that search for safer nsaids is completed. withdrawal of vioxx (rofecoxib) in 2004 and bextra ( xxxd3481xxx ) in 2005 from the market due to the associ-

ated adverse cardiovascular events raised a question on the
safety of this class of drugs and gave a setback to the journey
of selective cox-2 inhibitors. celebrex (celecoxib) is the

significant cardiovascular side effects in target. moreover, both traditional nsaids and selective cox-2 inhibitors
were found to have similar risk of adverse cardiovascular
events. recent findings have also highlighted an important
role of cox-2 in several pathophysiological processes such
as alzheimer’s disease, parkinson’s disease and various cancers. celecoxib was approved by fda as an adjunct for the
treatment of fap. thus, cox-2 has attracted the attention of
researchers as emerging therapeutic target in various other
areas of biomedical sciences beyond its current applications
in the treatment of inflammatory disorders. probably it is
required to further unravel the biology involved in pg biosynthesis with respect to cox enzyme and to have a relook
in to the design of selective cox-2 inhibitors. moreover,
emphasis should be given to find the lowest effective dose of
various selective cox-2 inhibitors in order to
avoid/minimize side effects. hopefully, the journey of selective cox-2 inhibitors will continue and deliver fruitful outcomes in future not only in the field of inflammation but also
in other therapeutic areas.
