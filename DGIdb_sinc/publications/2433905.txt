the enzyme  xxxg62xxx  ( xxxg62xxx ) is widespread in mammalian
tissues (1, 2). for cells that lack the purine de novo biosynthetic pathway,
 xxxg62xxx  is of particular importance as part of the salvage
pathway that provides hypoxanthine from erythrocyte atp. both adenosine
and 2'-deoxyadenosine are toxic at low concentrations to some cell types (3, 4)
and 2'-deoxyadenosine is particularly cytotoxic to t-lymphoid cells (4, 5). a
congenital metabolic defect,  xxxg1176xxx , is associated with absence of  xxxg62xxx  (6), and  xxxg62xxx 
inhibitors induce immunosuppression in experimental systems (7). conversely, many rapidly growing tumors, including leukemias (8, 9) and solid
tumors (2, 10-14) have elevated activity of  xxxg62xxx . the potent
inhibitors of  xxxg62xxx , coformycin and  xxxd2879xxx  ( xxxd2879xxx ) are cytotoxic to lymphoblasts in presence of traces of adenosine
or 2'-deoxyadenosine (4, 5, 15).  xxxd2879xxx  possesses clinical anticancer
activity as a single agent, particularly against t-cell and b-cell leukemias and
lymphomas (16-18). in addition it has been used in combination with
vidarabine (arabinosyladenine) against advanced leukemias (19, 20).
we now report the properties of a new analog of  xxxd2879xxx , with a 2'chloro substitution. 2'-chloropentostatin was isolated from the fermentation
broth of an unidentified actinomycete belonging to the genus a c t i n o m a d u r a ,
atcc 39365 (21). the same organism also produced coformycin and
 xxxd2879xxx . like these related compounds, 2'-chloropentostatin is an inhibitor
of  xxxg62xxx  (22). the isolation and structure elucidation of the
novel antibiotic, including the unambiguous synthesis of the carbohydrate
moiety, were first described by schaumberg et al. (22), who established the
structure of the nucleoside as (8r)-3-(2-chloro-2-deoxy-fl-d-ribofuranosyl)3,6,7,8-tetrahydroimidazo [4,5-d][1,3] xxxd1866xxx -8-ol. the structural formula
of 2'-chloropentostatin is shown in figure 1. subsequently, omura et al. (23)
reported the same compound.

the present report describes the kinetics of inhibition of rat and human
adenosine deaminases by 2'-chloropentostatin in comparison with  xxxd2879xxx . rates of dissociation of the enzyme-inhibitor complexes were also
measured. the ability of 2'-chloropentostatin to potentiate in vitro cytotoxicity of adenosine, 2'-deoxyadenosine, and vidarabine was studied using
cultured human b-cell and t-cell lymphoblasts. the in vivo interaction of 2'chloropentostatin with vidarabine sodium phosphate (ara-amp) was studied
using l1210 murine leukemia.
materials

and methods

chemicals. 2'-chloropentostatin,  xxxd2879xxx , coformycin, vidarabine, and
vidarabine sodium phosphate were provided by dr. j. c. french of warnerlambert co. adenosine and 2'-deoxyadenosine were obtained from sigma
chemical co., st. louis, mo.  xxxd1914xxx  was a product of boehringeringelheim.
cell culture. the ccrf-cem human t-cell lymphoblast line and the wil2 human b-cell lymphoblast line were grown in rpmi 1640 medium
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and  xxxd2193xxx  sulfate (50 #g/ml)
(schering corp., union, n.j.).
drug titrations were run in 2 ml cultures grown in 24-well flat-bottom
linbro plates, seeded with 1.6 × 105 cells. drugs were added at the time of
inoculation, and after growth at 37 ° and 95% humidity in 95% air + 5% co2
for 72 hr, cultures were counted on a coulter model zm particle counter.
activity was expressed as the amount of drug required to decrease the final cell
count to 50% of the untreated control values.
animals and tumors. mice and rats were purchased from charles river
breeding laboratories, inc., wilmington, ma. l1210 leukemia was passed
weekly in d b a / 2 inbred mice as intraperitoneal implants of 104 cells.
experimental chemotherapy was conducted in c d f 1 hybrid mice, following

2'-chloropentostatin

protocols described by leopold et al. (24). hepatoma 3924a was maintained
by subcutaneous implantation oftrochar fragments into inbred a c i / n rats at
3-week intervals. rats and mice were maintained on a 12 hr light-12 hr dark
cycle in an aalac-approved facility, with food and water provided ad
libitum.
enzyme kinetic studies.  xxxg62xxx  from rat intestinal mucosa
and from wi-l2 human lymphoblasts was purified approximately 40-fold by
ammonium sulfate fractionation and deae-sephadex column chromatography as previously described (2). the  xxxg62xxx  assay was based
on that of kalckar (25) modified according to jackson et al. (2). the reaction
was run at 265 nm, and calculated activity was based on a/x~mol~ for the
reaction of-8.5 x 10;. in substrate saturation kinetic studies, the km value for
 xxxg62xxx , with standard error, was calculated by nonlinear
regression analysis using wilkinson's algorithm (26). inhibition constants (ki)
with standard errors were calculated by a nonlinear regression technique
suitable for tight-binding competitive inhibitors (27).

was a better substrate than adenosine, in that km was lower, though vmax w a s
similar for adenosine and 2'-deoxyadenosine. however, arabinosyladenine
was a much worse substrate than adenosine, having a higher km and lower
vm~. kinetic studies with the  xxxg62xxx  of human erythrocytes by
cha e t al. (28) suggested that coformycin reacted in a 2-stage process; first a
complex was formed in which the inhibitor, though tightly bound, was readily
dissociable, and this first complex appeared to undergo a slow transition to a
second complex. the second complex did not represent irreversible inhibition,
since activity could be restored by a 24hr dialysis against a charcoal
suspension. agarwal e t al. (29), examining the inhibition of human
erythrocyte  xxxg62xxx  by  xxxd2879xxx , did not find biphasic
inhibition.
we examined the kinetics of inhibition of a variety of  xxxg62xxx 
preparations by  xxxd2879xxx  and by 2'-chloropentostatin. figure 2 shows
titration curves for inhibition of human lymphoblast (wi-l2 cell) adenosine
deaminase by the two inhibitors. the amounts of enzyme used for the two
titrations were identical. 2'-chloropentostatin was clearly a tight-binding
inhibitor of  xxxg62xxx , since extensive inhibition was obtained at
sub-nanomolar concentrations. however, 2'-chloropentostatin was less
potent than  xxxd2879xxx . results from this and similar inhibitor titration
experiments were used to calculate ki,slope values for  xxxg62xxx 
from a variety of sources. results are summarized in table 2. in all cases 2' xxxd2879xxx ( xxxd2879xxx ) was a more potent inhibitor than coformycin,
and for all four enzyme preparations, 2'-chloropentostatin was a slightly
weaker inhibitor than coformycin.  xxxd1914xxx  inhibited the two adenosine
deaminase samples against which it was tested, but it was not a tight-binding
inhibitor.

enzyme (0.35--4 pmole) was preincubated with inhibitor for 10 min at 37°c in
2. 5 ml of 0.15 m potassium phosphate buffer, ph 7.2 and reaction was started by
addition of 0.1 ml of 2.5 m u adenosine. steady state rates were obtained after
2-12 min depending upon inhibitor concentration.

we examined the time-dependence of inhibition of rat intestinal adenosine
deaminase by  xxxd2879xxx  and 2'-chloropentostatin. results are shown in
figure 3 as a plot of time against ln[(i-ei)/et-ei)]. for a simple 2nd-order
reaction such a plot would be linear, and within the limits of experimental
error this was the case for 2'-chloropentostatin, (figure 3b). however, for
 xxxd2879xxx  the plot was markedly biphasic (figure 3a), indicating a twostage reaction, as previously suggested for coformycin (28).

from the limiting slopes of figure 3a we calculated values of 4.3 × 106 m-1
sec-1 for kl and 8.0 × 104 ml sec"l for (k3. k~)/k2. although the biphasic nature
of the  xxxd2879xxx  inhibition implies that steady-state methods of kinetic
analysis are not strictly applicable to this system, formation of the second
complex (el*) was so slow that over a period of up to 20 min it could be
ignored. thus if enzyme and  xxxd2879xxx  were preincubated for i0 min, and a
further 10 rain allowed after addition ofsubstrate for the system to approach a
steady state, formation of el* during this period was sufficiently small that the
kinetic parameters determined reflect mainly formation and dissociation of the
first complex. this complication does not apply to 2'-chloropentostatin, which
shows no evidence of forming a second complex. to characterize further the
el* complex of  xxxd2879xxx  with  xxxg62xxx , we examined its

this plot would be linear with a slope of 2. 303/k(a-b), where k = 2nd-order rate constant, and a
and b denote inhibitor and enzyme concentrations, respectively. time indicates the length of
preincubation. steady-state rates were measured, and x (=el) was calculated from ei =
e j l-vi/vo). adenosine deamin ase concentration was 0. 215 nm, and inhibitor concentrations were
1.5 nm. reaction was conducted at p h 7.2 and 37 °. the adenosine concentration used in the assay
was 96/am.

dissociability in  xxxd3471xxx .  xxxg62xxx  from rat intestine was
mixed with 192 pmole of  xxxd2879xxx . after preincubation at 37 ° for 60 min,
the enzyme was 93% inhibited. the mixture was diluted 1 : 4 in i0 m aqueous
 xxxd3471xxx  (giving a final concentration of 8 m) and dialyzed for 2 hr against
200 vol of 8 m  xxxd3471xxx . control  xxxg62xxx  (no  xxxd2879xxx )
retained 96% of its initial activity after this treatment; 10 #1 aliquots were
taken to 2.5 ml in the assay cuvette, which diluted out the urea. however, this
two hour urea treatment only resulted in restoration of 3% of the activity o f
the enzyme that had been preincubated with  xxxd2879xxx . this lack of
dissociation of inhibitor in presence of 8m urea was consistent with
irreversible inhibition. however, agarwal et al. (29), working with human
erythrocyte  xxxg62xxx , showed that  xxxd2879xxx  could be removed
from the enzyme by a 48 hr incubation in the presence of a stirred slurry of
activated charcoal. we attempted to repeat their observation, using the rat
intestinal enzyme. the  xxxg62xxx  was preincubated for one hour at
37 ° with sufficient  xxxd2879xxx  to give 95% inhibition, and then stirred in
presence of a hemoglobin-coated activated charcoal suspension at 25 °.
conditions were as described by agarwal et al. (29) except that 0.1 m
potassium phosphate buffer, p h 7.2 was used. results are shown in figure 4,
in which the results of a control  xxxg62xxx  preparation treated with
water instead of  xxxd2879xxx  are also plotted. with the rat intestinal enzyme,

details are given in the text. eighty pmole  xxxg62xxx  and 192 pmole ofpentostatin were
used. activity was measured using the standard assay procedure.
to get substantially complete reactivation it was necessary to continue the
charcoal t r e a t m e n t for nine days. after this time the control enzyme retained
70% of the initial activity, and activity o f the  xxxd2879xxx -treated preparation
rose f r o m 5% of the zero-time uninhibited activity to 63% o f original activity
(88% o f the nine-day control activity). f r o m the d a t a of figure 4 we calculated
an 'off" rate constant for the ei* complex o f 1.7 x l0 -4 min-l; this is an
apparent value, since what was actually being measured was conversion o f ei*
back to e + i. this apparent rate constant corresponds to a half-life of 68 hr.
thus a l t h o u g h the inhibition o f rat intestine  xxxg62xxx  by
 xxxd2879xxx  is not irreversible, the reverse reaction is extremely slow.
a similar experiment was conducted using 2'-chloropentostatin, a n d results

3.3 hr was calculated, indicating that 2'-chloropentostatin is much m o r e
readily dissociable than  xxxd2879xxx . preliminary results indicate that the halftime for dissociation of 2'-chloropentostatin from human lymphoblast
enzyme is also approximately 3 hr.
it was possible to calculate a turnover number for  xxxg62xxx 
from the kinetic data, using the procedure described previously (27). the
turnover number calculated for the rat intestine enzyme was 18,600 +
2800 min -~, and similar values were obtained for the rat liver and hepatoma
preparations. for the human lymphoblast enzyme the turnover number was
11,200 + 900 min -~. if  xxxg62xxx  from human lymphoblasts was
preincubated with  xxxd2879xxx  for 10 min, and the reaction was then started by
addition of adenosine, an accelerating rate was obtained. by measuring the
time taken for the rate to reach 50% of the steady state rate, an estimate of the
rate constant for dissociation of the ei complex (the 'off' rate constant) can be
obtained (30). a reaction progress curve of this type is shown in figure 6. for
the curve illustrated the calculated 'off' rate constant was 9.2 x 10-3 min -~,
corresponding to a half-time of 75 min.

with 10% fetal calf serum, which contains  xxxg62xxx . horse serum,

satisfactory cell growth was not obtained. adenosine and deoxyadenosine at
100 #m were not cytotoxic under these conditions, and vidarabine (ara-a)
gave 50% inhibition of growth at 17/~m. in the simultaneous presence of 2/.tm
 xxxd2879xxx , 100/.tm adenosine gave 45% inhibition of cell growth, and 100/.tm
adenosine plus 2/.tm 2'-chloropentostatin gave 38% growth inhibition. in
presence of 100 #m 2'-deoxyadenosine,  xxxd2879xxx  and 2'-chloropentostatin
gave a similar inhibition of cell growth (72%). the two  xxxg62xxx 
inhibitors potentiated vidarabine to a similar extent in the wi-l2 cells (table
3).
a similar experiment conducted with the ccrf-cem t-lymphoblastoid
cell line is described in table 4.  xxxd2879xxx  potentiated adenosine in these
cells to about the same extent as in wi-l2 cells, but 2'-chloropentostatin plus
adenosine gave a greater degree of inhibition. 2'-deoxyadenosine was
considerably more toxic to the t-cell line than to the b-cell line, even in the
absence of  xxxg62xxx  inhibitors. this differential cytotoxicity of
deoxyadenosine to t-cells has been described previously (4,5). this
deoxyadenosine effect was markedly potentiated by  xxxg62xxx 
inhibitors, with 2'-chloropentostatin being somewhat more effective at a 2/.tm
concentration. vidarabine was slightly more cytotoxic to the ccrf-cem
cells than to wi-l2 cells, but the difference was less marked than for
deoxyadenosine.  xxxg62xxx  inhibitors gave about one log
potentiation, the effect being similar in degree for both  xxxd2879xxx  and 2'chloropentostatin.

experimental chemotherapy
the ability of  xxxd2879xxx  and 2'-chloropentostatin to potentiate the in vivo
antitumor effect of vidarabine was studied in the l 1210 leukemia. vidarabine
5'-phosphate (ara-amp) was used in these studies because of its greater watersolubility. at its optimal dose on the five-daily schedule (190mg/kg,
intraperitoneal), ara-amp gave only 18% increase in lifespan.  xxxd2879xxx 
and 2'-chloropentostatin, at 0.5 mg/kg, daily × 5, were well tolerated and gave
no lethality or significant weight loss, but gave no antitumor effect. this dose
of  xxxd2879xxx , in combination with ara-amp, gave a significant increase in
survival time (29%), and the optimal combination of ara-amp with 2'chloropentostatin gave a greater extension in lifespan, 58% (table 5).
in a subsequent experiment, the drugs were administered every three hours
for a 24 hr period, repeated every four days. on this schedule ara-amp
showed significant activity in the absence of  xxxg62xxx  inhibitors.
 xxxd2879xxx  and 2'-chloropentostatin were again without significant activity
as single agents, but both gave marked potentation of ara-amp, with 2'chloropentostatin again being somewhat more effective than  xxxd2879xxx 
(table 6). ara-amp alone, at its optimal dose, still permitted a net increase of

tumor burden of 2.7 logs, over the nine-day treatment period. in the presence
of 0.1 m g / k g 2'-chloropentostatin, this was converted into a net kill of 5.8 logs
of tumor cell burden.
summary
1.2'-chloropentostatin is a new inhibitor of  xxxg62xxx  isolated
from the fermentation broth of an unidentified actinomycete, atcc 39365. it
contains the aglycone of coformycin, i.e. 3,6,7,8-tetrahydroimidazo[4,5d][1,3] xxxd1866xxx -8-ol, coupled to the unusual carbohydrate, 2'-chloro-2'deoxyribose.
2. 2'-chloropentostatin is a slightly weaker inhibitor of rat and human
adenosine deaminases than coformycin, and considerably weaker than
 xxxd2879xxx .
3. unlike  xxxd2879xxx , which appears to undergo a two-stage interaction
with  xxxg62xxx , 2'-chloropentostatin forms a single enzymeinhibitor complex.
4. the enzyme-inhibitor complex between  xxxg62xxx  and 2'chloropentostatin was much more rapidly dissociable than the complex with
 xxxd2879xxx . the complex between  xxxg62xxx  and 2'-chloropentostatin dissociated with a half-life of approximately 3 hr, compared with
68 hr for the complex between  xxxg62xxx  and  xxxd2879xxx .
5. 2'-chloropentostatin, at concentrations up to 10 micromolar, did not
cause significant inhibition of growth of wi-l2 human b-cell lymphoblasts,
or of ccrf-cem human t-cell lymphoblasts in culture. however, it greatly
potentiated the inhibitory potency of adenosine, 2'-deoxyadenosine, or
arabinosyladenine towards these cell lines. this potentiating effect was
equipotent for 2'-chloropentostatin and  xxxd2879xxx .
6. t-cells (ccrf-cem) were much more sensitive to the inhibitory effect of
combinations of adenosine or 2'-deoxyadenosine with 2'-chloropentostatin or
 xxxd2879xxx  than were b-cells (wi-l2).
7.  xxxd2879xxx  and 2'-chloropentostatin had no significant antitumor
activity against mouse leukemia l1210 in vivo. however, these adenosine
deaminase inhibitors, at nontoxic doses, greatly potentiated the antitumor
activity of ara-a y-phosphate. 2'-chloropentostatin was somewhat more
active in this regard than was  xxxd2879xxx .
