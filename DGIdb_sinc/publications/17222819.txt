abstract
we examined whether treatment with  xxxd159xxx , a potent inhibitor of  xxxg1066xxx  protects mice from propionibacterium
acnes (p. acnes)-primed and lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced hepatitis. the subcutaneous injection of  xxxd159xxx  (2 and 5 mg/kg) significantly
increased the histamine levels in the liver in comparison to saline treated mice. pretreatment with  xxxd159xxx  also improved the survival rate of
the hepatitis mice, and this improvement was partially associated with the decrease in serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (ast) and
 xxxg941xxx  (alt).  xxxd159xxx  partially suppressed increases of  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-alpha in the serum and tnf-alpha mrna
expression in the liver, whereas the expression of interleukin (il)-18, interferon (ifn)-gamma and il-12 in the liver was not changed by  xxxd159xxx 
treatment. in conclusion, the present findings suggested that the elevation of endogenous histamine by  xxxd159xxx  may thus play a protective
role through the regulation of tnf-alpha production in endotoxin-induced hepatic injury mice.

1. introduction
the injection of propionibacterium acnes (p. acnes)
followed by a low dose of lipopolysaccharide (lps) can induce
fulminant hepatitis in mice, and this model has been used for the
analysis of liver injury. when lps is administered to p. acnesprimed mice, death from massive hepatic cell necrosis usually
occurs within 24 h (galle et al., 1995; tsuji et al., 1997). this
injury consists of two phases, the early priming phase induced
by injection of bacteria and the late excitation phase elicited by
lps. during the priming phase, mononuclear cells infiltrate into
the liver lobules, leading to the formation of granuloma, and the
following lps injection causes acute lethality with massive
hepatocellular damage. in this model, mononuclear cells,
including th1 cells, which produce plural cytokines, play an
important role during the development of p. acnes and lps-

induced liver injury (tsuji et al., 1997; katschinski et al., 1992;
smith et al., 1993; tsutsui et al., 1997; yoneyama et al., 1998).
histamine is well known for its roles in allergy, anaphylaxis,
gastric acid secretion and neurotransmission in the vertebrate
central nervous system (cns) (schwartz et al., 1991). in
mammals, the one-step enzymatic decarboxylation of  xxxd2282xxx 
by l- xxxg1040xxx  produces histamine. histamine
exerts its effects through action on four different types of
g-protein coupled receptors (hill et al., 1997; hough, 2001).
histamine mediates the inflammatory and allergic responses
mainly via h1 and h4 receptors (hofstra et al., 2003; thurmond
et al., 2004) gastric acid secretion via h2 receptors (black et al.,
1972), and modulates neurotransmitter release via h3 receptors
(arrang et al., 1983). there are two metabolic pathways to
inactivate histamine in the mammalian body: one is methylation by  xxxg1066xxx  ( xxxg1066xxx ,  xxxg1066xxx )
and the other is oxidative deamination by  xxxg167xxx 
(dao, ec 1.4.3.6).  xxxg1066xxx  and dao metabolize histamine into
n-methylhistamine and imidazole acetaldehyde, respectively
(schayer, 1959). the physiological actions of histamine are not

only related to the histamine receptors involved, but also the
activity of inactivating enzymes (schwelberger, 2004).  xxxg1066xxx 
is a cytosolic protein that is responsible for the intracellular
inactivation of histamine (verburg and henry, 1986). once
released into the extracellular space, histamine exerts its effect
by interacting on different receptors, followed by methylation
after uptake into cells through an unknown mechanism
(nishibori et al., 2000; tahara et al., 2000). the anti-malaria
drug  xxxd159xxx  has recently been shown to bind to  xxxg1066xxx  in
a stoichiometry of two molecules in the two active site pockets of
the  xxxg1066xxx  molecule (horton et al., 2005). this feature may be
one of the reasons for a higher potency among other  xxxg1066xxx 
inhibitors. the earlier study demonstrated that the in vivo
administration of a small dose  xxxd159xxx  dramatically
enhanced the effect of histamine on the gastric secretion in
dogs (barth et al., 1975).
in a previous study, we demonstrated that histamine via h2receptor inhibited lps-induced  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-alpha
production through the regulation of intercellular adhesion
molecule (icam)-1 and  xxxg396xxx  expression, leading to the
reduction of an innate immune response stimulated by lps
(morichika et al., 2003; takahashi et al., 2003). moreover,
inducible histamine via the h2-receptor protects mice from
p. acnes-primed lps-induced liver injury through the regulation of tnf-alpha production (yokoyama et al., 2004). tnf-alpha can
induce apoptosis in a variety of target cells, including hepatocytes, through the interaction with the tnf receptor (tnfr)
 xxxd924xxx  (tnfrp55) (galle et al., 1995). the activation of fas, a
tnfrp55-related molecule, has also been implicated in
fulminant hepatic injury (cleaveland and ihle, 1995).
tnfrp55 and fas share a conserved intracellular death domain
and have similar types of associated molecules in their pathways of signal transduction leading to apoptosis (fraser and
evan, 1996; hsu et al., 1995; itoh et al., 1992). few
pathological changes were observed in tnf receptor p55deficient (tnfrp55−/−) mice with p. acnes-primed lpsinduced liver injury in comparison to control wild-type mice
(tsuji et al., 1997). therefore, the production of tnf-alpha in the
mouse hepatitis model plays a key role in the cell death
mechanism of hepatocytes.
we herein examined the effect of  xxxd159xxx  on histamine
metabolism and hepatic injury in p. acnes-primed lps-induced
hepatitis mice to better understand the functional role of
endogenous histamine and the therapeutic potential of  xxxg1066xxx 
inhibitors in inflammatory hepatic injury.
2. materials and methods
2.1. mice
c57bl/6 mice (8 weeks old) were obtained from the
experimental animal center of okayama university. the mice
were housed at a temperature of 22 ± 2 °c and maintained with
an alternating 12-h light/dark cycle (light on at 0600 h). food
and water were given ad libitum. we abided by the guidelines
on animal experimentation of okayama university graduate
school of medicine, dentistry and pharmaceutical sciences,

and all procedures were licensed by the institutional animal
experimentation review committee.
2.2. experimental procedures
the mice received a tail vein i.v. injection of 1 mg of
p. acnes suspended in 100 mul of saline. after 7 days, the animals
were given an i.v. injection of 1 mug of lps in 100 mul of saline.
blood samples for the determination of aspartate aminotransferase (ast),  xxxg941xxx  (alt) and cytokines
were obtained from the orbital vein at the indicated time points.
when the effects of  xxxd159xxx  (2 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg) were
examined, the drug was injected s.c. 10 min before challenge
with lps.
2.3. determination of histamine and tele-methylhistamine
the liver tissue specimens were homogenized in 0.4 n
perchloric acid. histamine and tele-methylhistamine were
determined as described previously (nishibori et al., 1984).
serum alt and ast levels were determined using the
transaminase c‖-test wako (wako, osaka, japan) according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
2.4. rna extraction
total rna was isolated from freshly removed organs or
organs that were preserved with qiazol solution (qiagen). to
increase rna purity, the isolation method was modified as
follows. after precipitation with chloroform, the rna pellet
was resuspended in lysis buffer (qiagen) and further purified
using the ez1 rna cell mini kit (qiagen) according to
the manufacturer's instructions, including a dnase digestion
step.
2.5. deamination of mrna expression levels using real-time
quantitative pcr
total rna (1 mug) from liver was reverse-transcribed with
avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase xl and oligo
dt-primers (takara rna pcr kit; takara) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. pcr was performed using takara
extaq dna polymerase (takara) according to the manufacturer's instructions. the sense and anti-sense primers used for
the analysis of the expression of tnf-alpha, interferon inf-gamma,
interleukin (il-18), il-12, and  xxxg53xxx  were the following.
tnf-alpha: sense, 5′-agcctgtagcccacgtcgta; anti-sense,
5′-tctttgagatccatgccgttg (103 bp product size).
 xxxg1141xxx : sense, 5′-tacacactgcatcttggctttg; antisense, 5′-cttccacatct-atgccacttgag (128 bp product size). il-18: sense, 5′-gcaacctccagcatcaggac;

the annealing temperature of 60 °c was used for all primer
pairs. real-time pcr was performed with the sybr premix ex
taq (takara) in a light cycler instrument (roche) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. murine tnf-alpha,  xxxg1141xxx , il-18,
il-12 and  xxxg53xxx  were amplified using the primer pairs
described above at an annealing temperature of 60 °c.  xxxg53xxx 
expression was used to normalize cdna levels. the pcr
products were analyzed by a melting curve to ascertain the
specificity of amplification. the rt reactions, in which reverse
transcriptase was replaced with water as well as with genomic
mouse dna, were used as controls to rule out any products
derived from contaminating genomic dna.
2.6. reagents and drugs
lps (escherichia coli serotype 011.b4) was obtained from
sigma (st. louis, mo). p. acnes (atcc 11828, american type
culture collection, manassas, va) was heat-killed and
lyophilized as described previously (okamura et al., 1995).
 xxxd159xxx  was purchased from sigma. the plasma levels of
cytokines were determined using elisa kits for il-18 (mbl,
nagoya, japan), il-12 (p70),  xxxg1141xxx , and tnf-alpha, (r&d
systems, minneapolis, mn).

lps challenge aggravated the survival rate of p. acnes (1 mg/kg,
i.v.)-primed c57bl/6 mice with a lethality of 60% at 24 h after
lps challenge. the administration of  xxxd159xxx  (2 mg/kg,

2.7. statistical analysis
the data are expressed as the means ± sem of at least three
mice. statistical significance of the serum transaminases and
cytokines was evaluated by two-way anova followed by the
student's t-test. the statistical significance on the survival rate
was evaluated by the cox–mantel test. a value of p b 0.05 was
considered to be significant.

3. results

we observed an increase in histamine and tele-methylhistamine levels in the liver of the c57bl/6 mice 3 h after challenge
with lps.  xxxd159xxx  (2 mg/kg) treatment elevated histamine
levels in the liver in comparison to saline treated controls.
however,  xxxd159xxx  had no effect on tele-methylhistamine
levels in the mouse liver (fig. 2).

3.3. effect of  xxxd159xxx  on serum ast and alt levels in
 xxxd159xxx  challenge

p. acnes (1 mg/mouse, i.v.)-primed and lps (1 mug/mouse, i.v.)induced hepatitis was induced in c57bl/6 mice as described
previously (katschinski et al., 1992; smith et al., 1993). to
examine the functional roles of histamine, we first assessed the

the time-course changes in serum ast and alt levels were
determined in the c57bl/6 mice after injection of lps. in the
control mice, a significant increase of serum ast and alt
levels was observed at 3 and 6 h after the injection of lps. the
effects of  xxxd159xxx  (2 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg) on ast and alt
levels were examined.  xxxd159xxx  (2 mg/kg) decreased the
lps-induced increase in serum alt levels at 6 h and ast
levels at 6 h, whereas  xxxd159xxx  (5 mg/kg) decreased the
lps-induced increase in serum alt levels at 3 h and 6 h and
ast levels at 6 h (fig. 3).
3.4. effect of  xxxd159xxx  on serum tnf-alpha levels in mice with
p. acnes and lps-induced hepatitis

fig. 1. effect of  xxxd159xxx  on survival rates of mice with p. acnes-primed and

suspended in 100 mul of saline, followed by an i.v. injection of 1 mug of lps in
100 mul of saline 7 days later.  xxxd159xxx  (2 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg, s.c.) (amd)
was administered to mice 10 min before challenge with lps. ten mice were
used in each group.

we also determined the plasma cytokine levels which were
suggested to be involved in hepatic injury. the serum levels of
tnf-alpha increased markedly at 3 h after lps challenge.
 xxxd159xxx  dose-dependently lowered tnf-alpha levels in
comparison to the saline treated mice (fig. 4).

p. acnes alone. treatment with  xxxd159xxx  abolished the
increase in tnf-alpha mrna in liver of p. acnes-primed and lpstreated mice (fig. 5).
4. discussion
in the present study, we clearly demonstrated a significant
effect of  xxxd159xxx  in preventing severe hepatic injury and
high lethality in p. acnes-primed and lps-induced hepatitis
mice. we showed that  xxxd159xxx  treatment enhanced the
elevation of histamine in the liver of p. acnes-primed and lpsinduced hepatitis mice without accompanying tele-methylhistamine elevation.  xxxd159xxx , an anti-malarial drug, is the
most potent  xxxg1066xxx  inhibitor among a diverse class of inhibitors
(horton et al., 2005). kitanaka et al. (2002) examined the tissue
distribution patterns of  xxxg1066xxx  mrna in rat and mouse. the
expression of  xxxg1066xxx  mrna was detected in brain, kidney and
liver at relatively high levels (kitanaka et al., 2002). tahara et
al. (2000) also observed the cytosolic distribution of  xxxg1066xxx  in
the guinea-pig liver immunohistochemically. therefore, it is
quite likely that the increase of histamine levels in the liver by
 xxxd159xxx  was due to the inhibition of  xxxg1066xxx  activity. the
lack of reduction in tele-methylhistamine levels after  xxxd159xxx  treatment suggests that the rate of oxidation of telemethylhistamine may be low in the liver under this condition.
the elevation of histamine level in the mouse liver caused by
 xxxd159xxx  partially restored the survival rate of p. acnesprimed and lps-induced hepatitis mice. in the previous study,
we demonstrated that the induction of hdc occurred in
kupffer cells/macrophages of the mouse liver after challenge
with lps, in concomitant elevation of both histamine and tele-

methylhistamine. the resultant histamine in turn stimulated the
h2-receptors, leading to the diminished production of proinflammatory cytokines, tnf-alpha and il-18 (yokoyama et al.,
2004). taken together, it is postulated that  xxxd159xxx 
ameliorated the liver injury through augmenting the effects of
inducible histamine released from kupffer cells/macrophages.
tnf-alpha and il-18 have been repeatedly shown to be critical for
the development of severe hepatitis and lethality in this animal
model (tsutsui et al., 1997; tsuji et al., 1999; yokoyama et al.,
2004). we found that  xxxd159xxx  inhibited the expression of
tnf-alpha mrna in the liver and dose-dependently decreased
serum levels of tnf-alpha. the inhibition of tnf-alpha production
may prevent hepatic injury, leading to reduced levels of serum
alt and ast. thus, it is possible that treatment of mice with
 xxxd159xxx  partially restored the survival rate, probably due to
the inhibition of tnf-alpha production in the liver mediated by
elevated levels of histamine. a similar protective effect of
histamine was also reported on rat early alcohol-induced
hepatitis (hornyak et al., 2003). also, the same dose of
 xxxd159xxx  enhanced histamine-stimulated gastric secretion
in dogs (barth et al., 1975).
previous studies have demonstrated that histamine inhibits
lps-induced tnf-alpha production through the regulation of
icam-1 and  xxxg396xxx  expression. the interaction of icam-1/
lymphocyte function-associated antigen (lfa-1) and  xxxg396xxx /cd28
induces tnf-alpha production through the activation of nuclear
factor-kappab ( xxxg1559xxx ) in lps-stimulated human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (pbmcs) (morichika et al., 2003; takahashi
et al., 2003; yokoyama et al., 2004). histamine, by binding to the
h2-receptor, activates adenylate cyclase, which results in the
accumulation of cyclic adenosine 5′-monophosphate (camp)
(dell valle and gantz, 1997). it has also been reported that  xxxg1559xxx  activation is suppressed by an increase of camp (panny and
mackman, 1997). therefore, the histamine-induced inhibition of
tnf-alpha production is likely through the  xxxg1079xxx  via inhibition
of  xxxg1559xxx . it is possible that similar regulatory mechanism may
operate in the action of  xxxd159xxx . in conclusion, we herein
provided clear evidence of the protective role of  xxxd159xxx 
against p. acnes-primed and lps-induced liver injury by
maintaining tissue levels of endogenous histamine, which
regulated the production of tnf-alpha in kupffer cells/macrophages.
since  xxxd159xxx  was reported to be antigenic in human (clarke
et al., 1991), other types of  xxxg1066xxx  inhibitors should be
considered for possible treatment of inflammatory hepatic injury.
