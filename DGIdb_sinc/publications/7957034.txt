abstract
using pet, reduced glucose metabolism (r~mrgiu) and increased binding of the  xxxg1635xxx  ligand “ccarfentanil have been demonstrated in lateral temporal cortex overlying mesial temporal epileptic foci. binding of the
(dpn) to lateral temporal cortex has not shown consistent
non-specific opiate receptor ligand “c- xxxd1913xxx 
asymmetries. we measured rcmrglu with ‘*f-fdg and binding of “c- xxxd1913xxx 
in two patients with temporal
lobe epilepsy (tle) before and 5 months after selective amygdalo-hippocampectomy
(both patients were seizure-free
post-operatively). pre-operatively, in both patients rcmrglu was decreased in mesial temporal lobe (mtl) (asymmetry
index ai = -9.1 and 9.0) ipsilateral to the eeg focus. a more marked reduction was seen in ipsilateral lateral
temporal cortex (ltc) (ai = -32.0 and 18.9). dpn binding was reduced in mtl and ltc (ai mtl = -9.3 and
16.2; ai ltc = -8.0 and 5.5) ipsilateral to the focus, but was within 2 sd of the normal range. post-operatively, the
reduction of rcmrglu in ltc was accentuated in one patient and decreased in the other (ai = -23.1 and 45.7) while
there was a further reduction of dpn binding in ltc in both patients (ai = -27.8 and 9.8). these preliminary results
in only two patients are compatible with downregulation of opiate receptors in ltc after removal of the epileptic focus
or post-operative neuronal dysfunction.

65% of patients who undergo surgical treatment. in such cases selective removal of amygdala
and hippocampus has been advocated as an alternative to en bloc temporal lobectomy, in the hope
of causing less neuropsychological morbidity [16].
using ‘8fluorodeoxyglucose (‘*f-fdg) and positron emission tomography (pet) glucose hypomeabout

tabolism may be identified in and around an epileptogenic focus, with an approximately
70~80%
concordance
with eeg data [l,l i]. in patients
with seizure onset in mesial temporal lobe, the extent of glucose hypometabolism
is frequently more
marked in ipsilateral lateral temporal cortex than
in mesial temporal lobe [s,l i]. it has been suggested that hypometabolism
in lateral temporal
cortex may be the result of active inhibition
of
neurone activity or reduced efferent output from
mesial temporal structures.
the release of endogenous
opioids with anticonvulsant
activity at the time of generalized
tonic-clonic seizures has been demonstrated
in animal models [i 51. mu and kappa opiate receptors
predominate
in temporal cortex, with few delta
receptors being present. using pet a mean 915% upregulation
of “c- xxxd440xxx 
binding to
mu opiate receptors has been demonstrated
in lateral temporal cortex ipsilateral to the focus in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. it has been postulated that this represents a tonic upregulation
of
mu opiate receptors in response to epileptic discharges [2].
the synthetic opiate receptor ligand  xxxd1913xxx  binds to mu, kappa and delta receptors
with similar affinity. an initial report suggested
increased  xxxd1913xxx 
binding in lateral temporal cortex [3], but further studies have shown that
whilst binding was increased in some patients it
was decreased in others and overall there was no
significant
change.
’ 'c- xxxd440xxx  binding was
increased even in those patients with reduced  xxxd1913xxx 
binding [xl. these results led to the
hypothesis that there may be an upregulation
of
mu receptors and downregulation
of kappa receptors in lateral temporal cortex, and/or occupation
of kappa receptors by an endogenous
ligand. a
recent study using ‘xf-cyclofoxy, which binds to
mu and kappa, but not to delta receptors, gave
consistent
results. as a group, patients with epilepsy of mesial temporal lobe origin did not have
altered r8f-cyclofoxy binding in ipsilateral lateral
temporal cortex [ 141.
the purpose of this study was to investigate
changes in glucose metabolism
and opiate receptors in lateral temporal cortex after removal of a
chronic mesial temporal
lobe epileptic focus by

selective amygdalo-hippocampectomy.

2. patients and methods
2.1. putients
we investigated
two patients with drug-resistant complex partial seizures of mesial temporal
origin.
patient 1 was a 39-year-old female, with a 14year history of epilepsy. at the time of investigation she had 20 complex partial
seizures per
month, each with a duration of 2-4 min. medication was 600 mg carbamazepine
and 300 mg phenytoin per day. neurological
examination
was unremarkable.
prolonged
eeg monitoring
with
combined scalp and foramen ovale electrodes [ 171
recorded four spontaneous
complex partial seizures, all arising from the left mesial temporal
lobe. an mri scan obtained in the same week as
the pet scans showed mild lett hippocampal
gliosis and atrophy.
patient 2 was a 3 1-year-old female with a 9-year
history of epilepsy. at the time of investigation
she
had six complex partial seizures per month with a
seizure duration of 2 min. medication
was carbamazepine 1200 mg per day. neurological examination was unremarkable.
an mri obtained
a
month before the pet examination
revealed no
signi~~nt
abno~alities,
prolonged
eeg monitoring with combined scalp and bilateral foramen
ovale electrodes recorded three spontaneous
complex partial seizures, all originating
from right mesial temporal lobe.
permission
to perform these studies was obtained from the ethics committee
of the royal
postgraduate
medical school, hammersmith
hospital, london
and from the administration
of
radioactive
substances
advisory
committee
of
the united
kingdom
(arsac).
both patients
gave informed written consent after full explanation of the procedures.
both patients
underwent
selective amygdalohippocampectomy
within 3 months of the initial
pet study. histopathological
examination
revealed in patient 1 focal dyspiasia in association
with hippocampal
sclerosis and in patient 2 a focal microdysgenesis
of pyramidal cells.

p.a. barrensrein et allepilepsy research 18 (1994) 119-125

the pet studies were repeated 5 months after
surgery.
neither patient had any seizures, neurological
or cognitive deficits following surgery. at the
time of rescanning the medication of patient 1
was carbamazepine 600 mg and phenytoin 300
mg per day and patient 2 was on carbamazepine
1200 mg per day.
2.2. pet data acquisition
two dynamic pet scans were performed in
each patient using “f-fdg and “c- xxxd1913xxx , before and after surgery. scans were performed interictally, with patients taking their
usual medication. pet data were acquired on a
high resolution pet scanner ( xxxg2153xxx  93 l/12/8, cti,
knoxville, tn). the performance characteristics
of this system have been described by spinks et
al. [12]. the final image resolution of this system
for 15 simultaneously acquired slices is 8.5 x 8.5
x 7.0 mm (at full width half maximum).
the patients were positioned with the glabellainion line parallel to the detector rings, so that the
intercommisural line (ac-pc line) was in the
plane of the directly obtained transaxial images.
to minimize movement during scanning, the subject’s head was placed in an individually moulded
thermoplastic head support.
the scalp eeg was monitored continuously in
all subjects using the lo/20 system of electrode
placement. before each scan a lo-min transmission scan was collected using a retractable
68ga/68ge-ring source. the patients were fasted
for more than 6 h before 18f-fdg scans. 370
mbq 18f-fdg of high specific activity (> 10 000
mbq/pmol) were injected over 15 s and 26 scans
were collected over 75 min starting at the time of
injection. for quantification of opiate receptors,
370 mbq “c- xxxd1913xxx  of high specific activity (> 10 000 mbq/pmol) were injected over 30 s
and 27 scans were collected over 90 min.
in all studies, continuous arterial sampling was
carried out using an on-line bismuth-germanate
detection system to measure the tracer input function. plasma glucose concentration and the formation of  xxxd1913xxx  metabolites were measured
in arterial blood.
’ 'c- xxxd1913xxx 
and 18f-fdg scans were

121

analyzed with interactive image analysis software
(analyze version 5.01, biodynamics research
unit, mayo foundation,
rochester, mn) on
spare 2 workstations (sun microsystem inc,
mountain view, ca).
a library of 86 rectangular regions of interest
(roi) with an average size of 1.2 x 1.2 cm was
adapted to the individual brain scans by visual
inspection and with reference to the stereotactic
atlas of talairach and tournoux which is based
on the ac-pc line [13]. three roi were placed
on each mesial temporal lobe, five roi were
placed on the anterior portion and six on the posterior portion of each lateral temporal cortex. six
roi were placed on the primary visual cortex.
data from roi within predefined anatomical regions were averaged.
metabolism
regional
cerebral
glucose
(rcmrglc) was calculated using a two-tissue compartment model, fitting for kl, k2, k3, k4 and vb
[7]. a lumped constant of 0.42 was used [lo]. to
assess asymmetry in rcmrglc an asymmetry index (ai) was calculated according to the following formula: (l - r) x loo/[(l + r)/2] [ll].
these ai were compared with data from eight
normal subjects (median 43 years, range 35-52).
for each temporal roi, ratios of specific to
non-specific binding (s/ns ratio) of “c- xxxd1913xxx  were calculated as an index of binding potential. the averaged data collected from 40 to 90
min were used. the primary visual cortex (occ)
was used as a reference [6,8]. the s/ns ratio was
calculated according to the formula: (roi-occ)/
occ. an ai of s/ns ratio was then calculated.
this ai was compared with the data of eight agematched normal volunteers (median 34 years;
range 2&41) in whom “c- xxxd1913xxx 
pet
scans had been performed under identical circumstances.

3. results

sections

in patient 1 there was a 9.1% decrease of glucose metabolism in the mesial temporal lobe which
was consistent among all roi sampled. in lateral
temporal cortex there was an average decrease of
rcmrglc of 32.0% compared to the contralateral
side. the decreased metabolism extended through
the whole temporal lobe without marked differences between the anterior and posterior parts or
the inferior and superior parts (fig. 1a).
patient 2 showed a 9.0% decrease of rcmrglc

through

the temporal

lobe demonstrating

the extent of surgical

in right mesial temporal lobe, which was consistent among all roi sampled. there was an average decrease of 18.9% in right lateral temporal
lobe. the decrease was similar in the anterior and
posterior parts of the temporal lobe, but it was
slightly more pronounced in the inferior than in
the superior parts of the lateral temporal lobe.
the  xxxd1913xxx  studies showed a more pronounced asymmetry of the s/ns ratio in mesial
temporal than lateral temporal lobe (table 1). in

patient 1 the  xxxd1913xxx 
binding was 9.3% less
in left mesial temporal lobe and 8.0% lower in the
left lateral temporal lobe (fig. 1b). in patient 2 the
 xxxd1913xxx 
binding was 16.2% lower in right
mesial temporal lobe. the lateral temporal cortex
showed a smaller asymmetry
in  xxxd1913xxx 
binding (al = 5.5).
the age-matched
control group (n= 8) had a
mean ai of  xxxd1913xxx 
binding of -2.4 (sd
1i; range - 13.4 to + 16.2) in mesial temporal
lobe and -0.7 (sd 5.6; range - 5.1 to t 9.7) in
lateral temporal lobe.
3.2. post-operative
both patients had a selective amygdalo-hippocampectomy (fig. 1c). post-operatively
the asymmetry of rcmrglc in the lateral temporal cortex
resolved slightly in patient 1 (ai = -23.1) (fig.
1d). in patient 2, there was a further decrease of
rcmrglc
in lateral temporal
cortex on the affected side (ai = 45.7).
the asymmetry of  xxxd1913xxx 
binding in lateral temporal cortex increased by a factor of 3.5 in
patient 1 (fig. 1e) and by a factor of 2 in patient 2
(ai pat. 1 = -27.8; ai pat. 2 = 9.8).

4. discussion
it is only possible to draw limited conclusions
from preliminary
data derived from the study of
two patients. these studies are technically
very
demanding
and arduous for the patients,
the pre-operative
decrease of glucose metabolism in temporal lobe in our patients was more
pronounced
laterally than mesially. this is a recognized pattern in mesiobasal temporal lobe epilepsy [5,1 i]. a transient decrease of glucose metabolism has been previously reported in the lateral
temporal
cortex 3-5 months following
selective
amygdalo-hippocampectomy.
further
scans
12
months after surgery revealed that this decrease
had resolved, in most cases, to values slightly
above the preoperative
ones [4]. in the current
study one patient showed a reduction
and the
other an accentuation
of the lateral temporal lobe
hypometabolism
post-operatively,
suggesting that
there is considerable
interindividual
variability
to

research 18 (iyy4)

119 12.5

these changes.
the lack of increase in “c- xxxd1913xxx 
binding in the lateral temporal lobe on the side of the
seizure focus in our patients is consistent with the
observation
of mayberg et al. [8]. the slightly lower binding of  xxxd1913xxx 
in the mesial temporal
structures on the affected side in the preoperative
study of both patients may reflect neuronal dysfunction or loss. the further decrease of  xxxd1913xxx  binding in lateral temporal cortex 5 months
post-operatively
may reflect surgically
induced
loss of afferent input to the lateral temporal lobe,
which reduces the numbers of opiate receptors located on presynaptic
terminals [9]. it may also at
least partly be due to downregulation
of mu and/
or kappa opiate receptors. if mu opiate receptors
in the lateral temporal cortex are upregulated
in
response to epileptic activity, this process may be
expected to reverse after removal of the epileptic
focus [8]. patient 1 showed relative normalization
of glucose metabolism
and further reduction
of
opiate receptors
in the lateral temporal
cortex
post-operatively.
this implies, at least in this
case, that the further reduction in “c- xxxd1913xxx  binding was due to downregulation
of opiate receptors and was not simply a manifestation
of neuronal damage. in contrast, in patient 2 there
was further reduction of both cerebral glucose metabolism and “c- xxxd1913xxx 
binding in the ipsilateral lateral temporal
neocortex,
post-operatively. this would be consistent with post-operative neuronal
loss in lateral temporal neocortex.
with prelilninary
data only available on two subjects it cannot be stated which is the more common pattern. further pet studies. at a longer interval after surgery, will determine the subsequent
time course of any further change in opiate receptor binding.
