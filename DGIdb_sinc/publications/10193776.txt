1 the aim of this study was to examine whether  xxxd461xxx  sodium, a new inhibitor of 3-hydroxy3-methylglutaryl  xxxd1739xxx  (hmg-coa) reductase, aects the lesional composition of
spontaneously developed atherosclerosis due to hypercholesterolaemia and delays progression of
the lesions.
2 we administered  xxxd461xxx  to 2-month-old whhl rabbits, a low-density lipoprotein receptorde®cient animal model, at a dose of 0.6 mg kg71 day71 for 32 weeks. we examined the plasma lipid
levels, the severity of atherosclerosis, and composition of atherosclerotic lesions. lesional
composition was determined using immunohistostaining for macrophages and smooth muscle cells,
and azan-mallory staining for collagen ®bres and extracellular lipid deposits.
3 compared to the control group, the plasma cholesterol levels were decreased in the treated group
by 39% (12.7+0.6 mmol l71 versus 20.9+1.0 mmol l71, p50.001). atherosclerosis was
suppressed by about 37% as measured by the thickness of the aortic lesions (158+13 mm versus
250+15 mm, p50.001), and by 28% as measured by coronary stenosis (62.7+11.4 versus
86.9+12.2, p50.05). in the  xxxd461xxx  group, regarding the per cent areas of lesional components
in the lesion area, the macrophages (21.0+1.5% versus 27.9+1.9%, p50.01) and extracellular lipid
deposits (3.2+0.4% versus 5.1+0.4%, p50.001) were decreased in the aortic lesions, and the per
cent area of macrophages in the coronary lesions was also decreased (4.9+1.4% versus, 11.6+2.4%,
p50.05). the per cent area of smooth muscle cells and collagen ®bres did not signi®cantly decrease.
4 these results indicate that  xxxd461xxx  contributed to the plaque stabilization and delayed
progression of early atherosclerosis in young whhl rabbits, in addition to the potent
hypolipidemic eects.

introduction
clinical trials have demonstrated that inhibitors of 3-hydroxy3-methylglutaryl  xxxd1739xxx  (hmg-coa) reductase prevent
development of coronary events, in addition to having a
hypolipidemic eect (scandinavian simvastatin survival study
group, 1994; shephered et al., 1995; downs et al., 1998;
rosenson & tangney, 1998). vaughan et al. (1996) reported
that  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors do more than just lower
cholesterol regarding prevention of coronary events.
we have previously shown that an inhibitor of hmg-coa
reductase, pravastatin sodium, reduces plasma cholesterol
levels, and suppresses atherosclerosis in whhl rabbits, a
 xxxg1318xxx -de®cient animal model (watanabe et al., 1988; shiomi et al., 1990; 1995; 1998). in our
recent study using mature whhl rabbits that suered from
established atherosclerosis, pravastatin stabilized atherosclerotic plaques (shiomi et al., 1995). whhl rabbits are a useful
animal model for examination of antiatherosclerotic eects of
drugs, since atherosclerosis is developed due to spontaneous
hypercholesterolemia (watanabe, 1980; shiomi et al., 1992).
recently, it was reported that  xxxd461xxx  sodium
( xxxd461xxx , bay w 6228), a newly synthesized inhibitor of

* author for correspondence; e-mail: ieakusm@med.kobe-u.ac.jp

 xxxg1060xxx , potently inhibits the activity of hmgcoa reductase in the microgram range (angerbauer et al.,
1994; bischo et al., 1997). in a study of inhibition of
cholesterol synthesis in rat hepatocytes, the dose of  xxxd461xxx 
causing 50% inhibition was less than one-hundredth of the
required dose of lovastatin (bischo et al., 1997). in addition,
 xxxd461xxx  did not aect the blood pressure and heart rate in
dogs or the hematological parameters of rats (dr h. bischo,
bayer ag, germany, personal communication). on the other
hand, in vitro studies demonstrated that although pravastatin
has a weak eect on inhibition of smooth muscle cell growth,
 xxxd461xxx  caused a potent inhibition of proliferation of
human smooth muscle cells (negre-aminou et al., 1997;
corsini et al., 1996). igarashi et al. (1997a,b) also reported
that  xxxd461xxx  suppressed neointimal thickening by attenuating intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation and in®ltration
of macrophages in balloon-injured rabbit models. in addition,
wada et al. (1996) reported that the plasma  xxxg748xxx  levels
and  xxxg2266xxx  levels were decreased in 21
japanese patients treated with  xxxd461xxx , although the other
coagulation parameters did not change.

varies among various  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors. in our
previous observations, pravastatin sodium, an hmg-coa

reductase inhibitor which shows a low inhibitory eect on
smooth muscle cell proliferation in vitro (corsini et al., 1996)
caused no decrease in the smooth muscle cell content in the
atheromatous plaques of whhl rabbits. on the other hand,
¯uvastatin sodium, an inhibitor of  xxxg1060xxx 
which potently inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation in
vitro (corsini et al., 1996) reduced the smooth muscle cell
content in the atheromatous plaque of whhl rabbits (shiomi
et al., 1998). several researchers have discussed the conclusion
that inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation is
unfavourable for the prevention of coronary events (van der
wal et al., 1994; davies, 1995; libby, 1995; weissberg et al.,
1996). therefore, we considered it important to examine
whether  xxxd461xxx  aects the lesional composition of
atherosclerosis, especially smooth muscle cells.
in this study, we examined whether  xxxd461xxx  aects
lesional composition, especially smooth muscle cells, in the
spontaneously developed atheromatous plaques due to
hypercholesterolaemia, and con®rmed the preventive eect on
atherosclerosis. in addition, we compared the eects of
 xxxd461xxx  on the lesional composition of atherosclerosis
with those of other  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors previously
studied.

methods
reagents
 xxxd461xxx  was supplied by bayer yakuhin, ltd. (osaka,
japan). hhf35, a monoclonal antibody speci®c for muscle
actin, was purchased from enzo diagnostics, inc. (ny,
u.s.a.), ram-11, a monoclonal antibody speci®c for rabbit
macrophages, was purchased from dako a/s (glostrup,
denmark), and avidin-biotinylated enzyme complex (abc)
kits was purchased from vector laboratories inc. (ca,
u.s.a.).

animals
in order to measure plasma  xxxd461xxx  concentration, we
used 12 normal male japanese white rabbits aged 3 months
(kitayama labes co., ltd., ina, nagano prefecture, japan).
to examine the antiatherogenic eects of  xxxd461xxx , we
used 20 whhl rabbits aged 2 months, which were bred at
kobe university and had a high incidence of severe
coronary atherosclerosis (shiomi et al., 1992). these rabbits
were divided into control group (®ve females and ®ve males)
and  xxxd461xxx  group (®ve females and ®ve males) so as to
make the plasma lipid level, body weight, and litter
distribution uniform. the rabbits in the  xxxd461xxx  group
were subcutaneously injected with  xxxd461xxx  solution
(1 mg ml71 in saline) at a dose of 0.6 mg kg71 day71 for
32 weeks. since plasma drug concentration does not increase
in rabbits when  xxxd461xxx  is given orally, we administered
the drug to rabbits by subcutaneous injection. the control
rabbits were injected subcutaneously with saline. rabbits
were housed individually in metal cages in a room
maintained at a constant temperature and humidity, and
were fed 100 g of laboratory diet (rc4, oriental yeast co.,
tokyo, japan) per day. water was given ad libitum. all
aspects of animal experimentation and care were conducted
according to the guidelines for animal experimentation of
the kobe university school of medicine, the law
concerning the protection and control of animals (law
no. 105, 1973), and standards relating to the care and

antiatherogenic effect of  xxxd461xxx 

management, etc. of experimental animals (noti®cation
no. 6, 1980).

plasma lipid measurement
blood samples were taken from the marginal ear vein after
overnight fasting and plasma was obtained by addition of
sodium-edta and centrifugation. plasma total cholesterol,
triglyceride and phospholipid levels were measured by
enzymatic methods.

preparation of histological sections
at the end of 32 weeks of drug administration, rabbits were
anaesthetized by intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital (25 mg kg71) and perfused with lactated  xxxd3213xxx  solution.
after the perfusion, the aortas were excised, and then the
coronary arteries were perfused with bouin's ®xative at a
constant pressure of 100 mmhg. the aortas were divided into
aortic arch, thoracic aorta, and abdominal aorta. the thoracic
aortas and hearts were immersed in bouin's ®xative for at least
24 h. the remainders of the aortas were frozen and used for
other purposes. after immersion-®xation, aortas were longitudinally cut open and the surface area of the intima and the
lesion were determined with a colour image analyzer, sp-500
(olympus, ltd., osaka, japan). aortic atherosclerosis was
histologically examined at ®ve locations: the regions beneath
the ®rst, third, ® xxxg818xxx , seventh and ninth ori®ces of the
intercostal artery. the segments in each portion were
embedded in paran, and ten sections, 4 mm thickness, were
cut serially from each segment.
coronary atherosclerosis was examined in the main trunk
of the left coronary artery (lmt, four segments), the origin
portion of the right coronary artery (rco, four segments), the
left circum¯ex artery (lcx, 30 segments), and the right
coronary artery (rca, 20 segments). the hearts were divided
into six blocks, and the blocks were embedded in paran. the
blocks containing lmt or rco were sectioned at 200 mm
intervals and the other blocks were sectioned at 500 mm
intervals. a total of 58 segments from each heart were
examined and ten sections, 4 mm in thickness, were cut serially
from each segment.
one section of each segment was stained with elastic van
gieson's stain. sections from each aortic segment and from the
coronary segments showing the most severe stenosis in the
lmt, rco and lcx were stained with monoclonal
antibodies, hhf35 and ram-11, and with azan-mallory's
stain. immunostaining was carried out with a vectastain abc
kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.

quantitative analysis of atherosclerosis and lesional
composition
all parameters for atherosclerotic lesions were measured with
a colour image analyzer. the degree of atherosclerosis was
evaluated by the per cent of lesion area in the surface of
intima (the surface area of lesions/the surface area of the
whole intima) and the thickness of atherosclerotic lesions
(area of intimal lesions/length of external elastic lamina) in
the thoracic aortas (shiomi et al., 1990), and by the score of
stenosis in the coronary arteries (shiomi et al., 1995). intimal
lesion area was estimated using sections stained with elastic
van gieson's stain. we measured coronary stenosis in 58
segments per heart and calculated the coronary stenosis score
of each segment. the coronary score was graded as follows:
no lesion, 0 points; stenosis of 10% or less narrowing, 1

m. shiomi & t. ito

point; stenosis of 10 ± 20% narrowing, 2 points; stenosis of
20 ± 30% narrowing, 3 points; stenosis of 30 ± 40% narrowing, 4 points; stenosis of 40 ± 50% narrowing, 5 points;
stenosis of 50 ± 60% narrowing, 6 points; stenosis of 60 ± 70%
narrowing 7 points; stenosis of 70 ± 80% narrowing, 8 points;
stenosis of 80 ± 90% narrowing, 9 points; stenosis of over
90% narrowing, 10 points. these points were summed for
each portion, and the total points for each rabbit were also
counted.
lesional components were quantitatively evaluated with the
colour image analyzer at a magni®cation of656 to6280, and
the lesion area and the area of each lesional component was
measured according to the method reported previously
(shiomi et al., 1994). we de®ned cells stained with hhf35
as smooth muscle cells and cells stained with ram-11 as
macrophages. in sections treated with azan-mallory's stain,
®bres stained with cobalt blue were de®ned as collagen, and
extracellular vacuoles and lacunae as extracellular lipid
deposits. the per cent area of each lesional component was
calculated by dividing the area of each lesional component by
the lesion area and multiplying by 100%.

evaluation of xanthoma
xanthomas were observed macroscopically on the digital
joints in each leg after the skin had been removed. the severity
of xanthoma was graded as follows: no lesions (7), slight
lesion (+) showing diuse granular lesions, moderate lesion
(++) showing one massive lesion with or without diuse
granular ones, and severe lesion (+++) showing more than
one massive lesion with or without diuse granular ones
(shiomi et al., 1990).

plasma concentration of  xxxd461xxx 
the plasma concentration of  xxxd461xxx  was measured after
a single administration of the drug. normal japanese white
rabbits were divided into four groups. three rabbits were
given  xxxd461xxx  orally at a dose of 0.15 mg kg71, and three
rabbits each in the other three groups were subcutaneously
injected with the drug at a dose of 0.15 mg kg71,
0.3 mg kg71 or 0.6 mg kg71. blood samples were obtained
from the marginal ear vein of each rabbit at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0
and 6.0 h after drug injection. the plasma  xxxd461xxx 
concentration was determined using hplc equipped with a
lichrospher 100 rp-18 column according to the method of
krol et al. (1993) with slight modi®cation. we analysed t
max, c max, and the area under the concentration curve
(auc) from 0 ± 6 h.

the means of atherosclerosis, fischer's exact probability test
for incidences of xanthoma, and wilcoxon's rank sum test for
xanthoma severity.

results
there were no ®ndings of myopathy or hepatic disorders in
any rabbits. in the atherosclerosis prevention study, one rabbit
in the control group died suddenly at the 30th week of
treatment. autopsy of this rabbit showed no sign of infection
or any other abnormality.

plasma  xxxd461xxx  concentration
in preliminary experiments, plasma cholesterol levels did not
decrease in whhl rabbits administered  xxxd461xxx  orally at
a dose of 0.15 mg kg71. accordingly, we examined plasma
 xxxd461xxx  concentrations in normal rabbits. table 1 shows
the plasma concentrations of  xxxd461xxx . c max and auc
were remarkably higher in the subcutaneous injection group
than in the oral administration group at the same dose. these
data show that oral administration of  xxxd461xxx  is not
suitable for rabbits. with subcutaneous injection, c max and
auc increased dose-dependently.

plasma lipid levels
table 2 shows plasma lipid levels of whhl rabbits treated with
 xxxd461xxx . at the start of this experiment, plasma lipid levels
were similar in the  xxxd461xxx  and control groups. at the end of
the experiment, the total cholesterol levels of the  xxxd461xxx 
group were signi®cantly decreased, by 39%, compared to the
control group. although the phospholipid levels were also
signi®cantly decreased, by 33%, the decrease in triglyceride
levels of the  xxxd461xxx  group was not signi®cant. in the control
group, the plasma lipid levels were decreased with progression
of the study. in general, the plasma lipid levels of whhl
rabbits are decreased with ageing due to an age-associated
decrease in vldl secretion from the liver (unpublished results).

severity of aortic and coronary atherosclerosis
table 3 shows measurements of the extent of atherosclerotic
lesions of the thoracic aorta. the lesion thickness of the
 xxxd461xxx  group was signi®cantly lower at the third and
ninth ori®ces of the intercostal artery, and the mean value of
all portions was also signi®cantly decreased, by 37%,
compared to the control group (158+13 mm versus
250+15 mm, p50.001). the per cent lesion area in the
surface of the intima that was calculated by dividing the
surface area of lesions by the surface area of the whole
intima was decreased by 37%; these were not signi®cantly
dierent. figure 1 shows the coronary stenosis in control
and treated rabbits. we examined 58 sections per heart. the
coronary stenosis score of the  xxxd461xxx  group was
signi®cantly decreased, by 28% in the total heart
(62.7+11.4 versus 86.9+12.2, p50.05), compared to the
control group. the average of the most severe stenosis in
each portion was 44.9+4.5% (n=40) in the  xxxd461xxx 
group and 50.9+4.4% (n=36) in the control group; these
were not signi®cantly dierent.

lesional composition
figure 2 shows the lesional composition of atherosclerotic
plaques of the thoracic aorta. although the per cent areas of
collagen and smooth muscle cell were not altered, those of
macrophages and extracellular lipid deposits were signi®cantly
decreased, by 25% (21.0+1.5 versus 27.9+1.9, p50.01) and
37% (3.2+0.4 versus 5.1+0.4, p50.01), respectively, in the
 xxxd461xxx  group compared to the control group. typical
®ndings are shown in figure 3. the control rabbits showed
accumulation of large foam cells and extracellular lipid
deposits in the atheromatous plaques, while the area occupied
by macrophages and extracellular lipid deposits were smaller in
the  xxxd461xxx -treated rabbits. in addition, the atherosclerotic
lesions were not as thick in the  xxxd461xxx  group as in the
control group. although the frequency of disappearance of
internal elastic lamina, accumulation of cholesteryl crystals,
and calci®cation did not decrease, the frequency of fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina was signi®cantly decreased in
the  xxxd461xxx  group (76% versus 96%, p50.01).
figure 4 shows the lesional composition of the coronary
atherosclerosis. the per cent area of macrophages in the
 xxxd461xxx  group was signi®cantly decreased, by 58%,
compared to the control group (4.9+1.4 versus 11.6+2.4,
p50.05). other lesional components tended to be decreased
by the  xxxd461xxx  treatment. typical ®ndings are shown in
figure 5. the frequency of fragmentation and disappearance
of the internal elastic lamina were signi®cantly decreased in the
 xxxd461xxx  group (19% versus 48%, p50.05 and 7% versus
33%, p50.05, respectively)

xanthoma
table 4 summarizes ®ndings about the xanthoma of whhl
rabbits. the incidence of xanthoma in the  xxxd461xxx  group
was signi®cantly lower in the hind legs and total legs than in
the control group. the distribution of severity of xanthoma
shows that the degree of xanthoma in the  xxxd461xxx  group
was signi®cantly less than in the control group (p50.001).
although the frequency of degree of severity over (+) was
61% in the control group, it was only 3% in the  xxxd461xxx 
group.

discussion
in the present study,  xxxd461xxx  decreased the plasma total
cholesterol levels and suppressed progression of the early
atherosclerosis and xanthoma in young whhl rabbits. in

antiatherogenic effect of  xxxd461xxx 

addition, we showed a decrease in the per cent areas of
macrophages and extracellular lipid deposits and no decrease
in the per cent areas of smooth muscle cells and collagen ®bres
in the early atherosclerotic lesions of young whhl rabbits
treated with  xxxd461xxx .
in a similar study using ¯uvastatin sodium, another hmgcoa reductase, while the per cent areas of smooth muscle cells,
collagen ®bres, and extracellular lipid deposits were decreased,
the per cent area of macrophages was increased in the early
atherosclerotic lesions of young whhl rabbits (shiomi et al.,
1998). both  xxxd461xxx  and ¯uvastatin show inhibitory eects
on proliferation of smooth muscle cells in in vitro studies
(corsini et al., 1996; negre-aminou et al., 1997; bellosta et al.,
1998) and in vivo studies using normocholesterolaemic rabbits
which had neointimal thickening of arteries caused by injury
(soma et al., 1993; bandoh et al., 1996; igarashi et al., 1997b).
however, in our studies using young whhl rabbits,
¯uvastatin caused a decrease in the per cent area of smooth
muscle cells in the atherosclerotic lesions whereas  xxxd461xxx 
did not, despite the similar hypolipidemic eects of the two
drugs. on the other hand, pravastatin, which shows little
inhibitory eect on smooth muscle cell proliferation in vitro
(soma et al., 1993; corsini et al., 1996; bellosta et al., 1998)
decreased the per cent area of macrophages and extracellular
lipid deposits, but did not aect smooth muscle cells in the
established lesions of mature whhl rabbits (shiomi et al.,

values in parentheses are represented as (xanthoma-positive legs)/(examined legs). the xanthoma of the treated group was signi®cantly
milder than that of the control group by wilcoxon's rank sum test (p50.001). statistical analysis of the incidence was carried out with

1995). these results suggest that the eects of various hmgcoa reductase inhibitors on the composition of atherosclerotic
lesions dier, despite the similar hypolipidemic eects.
although we have no data to explain these inconsistencies,
each  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitor may have yet unknown
properties. rosenson and tangney (1998) also reported that
the properties of various  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors
dier. they reviewed the antiatherosclerotic properties of
various  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors, especially lovastatin,
pravastatin and simvastatin. in their review, the eects of
dierent  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors varied regarding
endothelial function, in¯ammatory responses, antioxidant
capacity, ®brinogen levels, blood and plasma viscosity, levels
of plasminogen activator inhibitor, and lp(a) levels.
since smooth muscle cells regulate synthesis of intercostal
collagens, no change or an increase in smooth muscle cell
content in the atheromatous plaques should render a plaque
less liable to disruption than would a decrease in smooth
muscle cells. libby (1995) and weissberg et al. (1996) have
reviewed evidence that intimal smooth muscle cells protect
plaques from rupturing and render unstable, potentially lethal
lesions more stable. moreover, davies (1995) and van der wal
et al. (1994) showed that regions of the ®brous cap of plaques
that have ruptured contain relatively few smooth muscle cells.
therefore, the lack of decrease of smooth muscle cells and
collagen ®bres in the atheromatous plaques suggests that
 xxxd461xxx  did not make the plaques prone to disruption in
young whhl rabbits.
on the other hand, in vitro studies (negre-aminou et al.,
1997; corsini et al., 1996; igarashi et al., 1997b) and an in vivo
study using balloon-injured arteries of normocholesterolaemic
rabbits (igarashi et al., 1997a,b) showed that  xxxd461xxx 
inhibited proliferation of smooth muscle cells. regarding the
disagreement on inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation
between our present results and previous reports, we think that
the mechanism regulating smooth muscle cell proliferation in
spontaneously developed atherosclerosis may be dierent from
those in injured arteries or culture conditions, and  xxxd461xxx 
may eectively inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation in
culture conditions or injured arteries. alternatively, the
stimulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation may be more
potent in culture conditions and injured arteries than in
spontaneously developed atherosclerosis due to hypercholesterolaemia.  xxxd461xxx  may inhibit smooth muscle cell
proliferation more eectively in response to strong proliferative stimuli than in response to weak proliferative stimuli.
in a previous study, we observed that the content of smooth
muscle cells in the atherosclerotic lesions was low in whhl
rabbits aged about 10 months (shiomi et al., 1994). therefore,
the inhibitory eect of  xxxd461xxx  on smooth muscle cell
proliferation may not have been observed in this study.
in our previous study using mature whhl rabbits given
pravastatin from 10 to 22 months of age, pravastatin prevented

decreases in collagen ®bres and smooth muscle cells in the
established atherosclerotic lesions, despite decreases in
collagen and smooth muscle cells in the lesions of the placebo
group (shiomi et al., 1995). in the present study, however, the
per cent areas of collagen ®bres and smooth muscle cells in the
early atheromatous plaques did not decrease signi®cantly in
the  xxxd461xxx  group, compared to the control groups. this
disagreement regarding the eects of  xxxg1060xxx 
inhibitors on collagen and smooth muscle cells may be due to
the dierence in the stage of atherosclerosis in the two studies.
the present study used young rabbits which had lesions of
early to transitional stages (shiomi et al., 1994), while mature
whhl rabbits which had lesions of transitional to advanced
stages (shiomi et al., 1994) were used in the previous study.
our results showed that  xxxd461xxx  reduced the atheromatous core, macrophages and extracellular lipid deposits in
the centre of the lesion. these results are similar to those of
previous studies using mature whhl rabbits which suered
from established atherosclerosis treated with pravastatin alone
(shiomi et al., 1995) and in combination with  xxxd1684xxx 
(shiomi et al., 1990). davies et al. (1993) reported that
unstable plaques had large lipid cores, and galis et al. (1995)
reported that macrophages secreted matrixdegradation proteinases, and collagen ®bres might be degraded. therefore,
reduction of atheromatous cores in the lesions is considered
favourable with respect to stabilization of the plaque.
although it was reported that the plasma concentration of
 xxxd461xxx  was increased by an oral administration in humans
(krol et al., 1993) and various animals (steinke et al., 1996), an
extremely low plasma drug concentration and no decrease in
the plasma lipid levels were observed when  xxxd461xxx  was
given to whhl rabbits orally. therefore, we administered
 xxxd461xxx  to rabbits by subcutaneous injection in this study.
by subcutaneous injection of  xxxd461xxx , we achieved
reduction of plasma cholesterol levels and suppression of
atherosclerosis and xanthoma. we consider that an adequate
plasma drug level led to the large eect on reduction of plasma
cholesterol level and preventing atherosclerosis.
in conclusion, this study showed that  xxxd461xxx  suppressed progression of early atherosclerosis and qualitatively
ameliorated and stabilized the atheromatous plaques, in
addition to exerting potent hypolipidemic eects. furthermore, our results suggest that the eects of various hmg-coa
reductase inhibitors on atherosclerotic lesions are somewhat
dierent.
