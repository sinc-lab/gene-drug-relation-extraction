summary
synopsis

 xxxd2020xxx  is a combination of the mesylated forms of dihydroergocornine, dihydroergocristine, dihydro-a-ergocryptine and dihydro-/3-ergocryptine. in animal models and healthy
elderly volunteers the compound improves indices of cognitive function such as memoly and learning.
the mechanism(s) behind such action remains under investigation. nonetheless, it has been
proposed that  xxxd2020xxx  has a dual effect on central monoaminergic neurotransmitter
systems, compensating for both hyperactivity and deficits of the adrenergic, serotoninergic and
dopaminergic systems. the compound also appears to have a normalising effect on the power of
electroencephalogram frequencies, and may improve cerebral metabolism.
results from controlled studies of elderly patients with age-related cognitive decline have established that  xxxd2020xxx  is well tolerated and, in some studies, had statistically significant positive effects on symptoms of cognitive dysfunction. however, there is considerable controversy over the clinical relevance of these results as there was wide variability in the number and
type of cognitive and neuropsychological assessments used in individual studies and there may
have been considerable overlap in diagnosis of patients with varying degrees of dementia. in addition, the drug has not been compared with most other, more recently developed, centrally active
agents. thus, the specific place of  xxxd2020xxx  in the treatment of age-related cognitive
decline remains undetermined, despite many years of clinical use.
pharmacodynamic properties

 xxxd2020xxx  is a combination of the mesylated forms of the 4 dihydrogenated ergot
alkaloid derivatives, dihydroergocornine, dihydroergocristine, dihydro-a-ergocryptine and dihydro-i3-ergocryptine in the ratio 3 : 3 : 2 : i, and has direct action at a-adrenergic, dopamine and
serotonin (5-ht) receptors. although the mechanism of action of  xxxd2020xxx  has yet
to be established conclusively, it appears to have a normalising effect on central monoaminergic
neurotransmitter systems in elderly patients, compensating felr under- and over-activity of the
adrenergic, serotoninergic and dopaminergic systems. the compound has marked pre- and postsynaptic a-adrenoceptor antagonist activity, with higher affinity for a2- than ai-receptors, and
has mixed agonist/antagonist effects at dopamine di- and d2-receptors and at serotoninergic (5ht i and 5-ht 2) receptors.  xxxd2020xxx  also has a positive effect on cerebral metabolism and synaptic activity.
in animal models designed to evaluate parameters of learning and memory co-dergocrine
mesylate administration has been associated with improved spatiotemporal performance, and
enhanced habituation of exploratory activity and motor activity. in healthy elderly volunteers
and elderly patients,  xxxd2020xxx  administration increased the power of electroencephalographic (eeg) alpha and/or beta activity and decreased that of the lower delta and theta
frequency bands. improved availability of cognitive processing resources was also demonstrated
by the augmentation of the p300 amplitude in elderly volunteers. however, long term  xxxd2020xxx  administration had no statistically significant effect on cognitive function of
healthy volunteers.
pharmacokinetic properties

approximately 25% of an orally administered  xxxd2020xxx  dose is absorbed in humans. peak plasma concentrations of 0.5 to 1.2 !lg/l are typically achieved within 0.5 to 2.3
hours of oral administration of doses of i to 6mg and plasma elimination half-life ranges between
1. 5 and 4.1 hours.  xxxd2020xxx  is eliminated mainly via biliary excretion although
small amounts have been detected in the urine. in healthy elderly subjects total plasma clearance
is reduced by approximately 30% compared with younger adults and there is a 2.5-fold increase
in bioavailability, possibly as a result of a reduced extraction ratio.
therapeutic efficacy in age-related cognitive decline

previous reviews of controlled studies have suggested that  xxxd2020xxx  3 to 4.5
mg/day has a statistically significant and consistent effect on the symptoms of age-related cognitive decline although there has been some dispute over the clinical relevance of these findings.

 xxxd2020xxx : a review

155

evidence from a meta-analysis of 49 placebo-controlled studies conducted over the past 3 decades
confirms the findings of earlier reviews, although results suggest that in patients with dementia
 xxxd2020xxx  has a greater effect on behaviour than cognitive performance. findings
from those placebo-controlled studies conducted over the past decade have been less consistent.
investigators have reported varying effects on the key symptoms of cognitive dysfunction (recent
memory impairment, mental dullness, confusion, disorientation and lack of self care). several
investigators also noted statistically significant improvements in some symptoms of agitation/
irritability, mood depression, withdrawal and deterioration in health, although actual quantitative
changes were small. these variations in results have done little to resolve the controversy over
the effectiveness of  xxxd2020xxx  therapy in patients with age-related cognitive decline.
also confounding attempts to evaluate the efficacy of  xxxd2020xxx  have been: the lack
of a generally accepted diagnosis of age-related cognitive decline during the period in which most
of the studies were conducted; the similarity in symptoms of patients with age-related cognitive
decline and those of patients with early signs of alzheimer's disease; and, the lack of comparisons
with most other purportedly useful agents. while  xxxd2020xxx  has some statistically
significant beneficial effects on the key symptoms of cognitive dysfunction in some patients with
mild-to-moderate dementia, and it is possible that senile dementia of the alzheimer type is a
continuum of mild-to-moderate dementia, further research is required to determine whether the
compound has a significant effect on cognitive function in patients with a diagnosis of senile
dementia of the alzheimer type.

tolerability
cq-dergocrine mesylate has been well tolerated in clinical studies. gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, gastric upset, anorexia, abdominal pain and vomiting) were the most frequently
reported unwanted effects. dizziness, headache, nasal stuffiness, precordial discomfort, drowsiness, sleep disorders, and restlessness occurred in less than 3% of participants in non blind studies.
the frequency of reported adverse events decreases markedly during continued therapy.

dosage and administration
for long term therapy of mild-to-moderate symptoms of age-related cognitive decline the usual
dosage of  xxxd2020xxx  (administered orally) ranges from i to 1.5mg.j times daily,
although daily dosages of up to 13.5mg have been administered in clinical studies.

 xxxd2020xxx  ( xxxd2020xxx ,
 xxxd2020xxx ) is a combination of
the mesylated forms (methanesulphonates) of the
4 dihydrogenated ergot alkaloid derivatives, dihydroergocornine, dihydroergocristine, dihydro-a-ergocryptine and dihydro-!3-ergocryptine (fig. 1) in the
ratio of 3: 3 : 2 : 1. early investigation of the pharmacological properties of  xxxd2020xxx 
revealed that the compound was a peripheral vasodilator, and the main indications following its
introduction in 1949 were peripheral vascular disorders, hypertension, and angina pectoris (data on
file, sandoz). subsequently investigators identified
that, in addition to its peripheral vasodilatory
properties,  xxxd2020xxx  exerted a number of positive effects in patients with age-related

cognitive decline or dementia. these included improvements in mental alertness, recent memory,
orientation, agitation, motivation, anxiety, depression, dizziness and mobility, and reduced confusion (see reviews by fanchamps 1983; hughes et
al. 1976; mcdonald 1979; sathananthan et al.
1977).
there are, as yet, no satisfactory or universal
definitions for age-related cognitive decline, dementia or cerebrovascular insufficiency. the terms
'benign senescent forgetfulness', 'senile cerebral insufficiency' and 'age-associated memory impairment' have also been used to describe age-related
cognitive decline, and age-associated memory impairment has been interpreted as memory loss
without dementia in patients aged over 50 years

(crook 1988; crook et al. 1986). however, age-related cognitive decline and, to a lesser extent, very
mild dementia seem to be overlapping concepts
rather than separable diagnoses (flicker et al. 1986)
and patients with either diagnosis have been included in studies discussed in the clinical efficacy
section (see section 3).

1. pharmacodynamic properties
the basic pharmacodynamic profile of  xxxd2020xxx  has been demonstrated in numerous experimental studies (loew et al. 1980;
loew & weil 1982; markstein 1985; spagnoli &
tognoni 1983; weil 1988). however, the mechanism of action of  xxxd2020xxx  has yet
to be established conclusively.
1.1 effects on neurotransmitter systems
disturbances of cerebral neurotransmitter systems have been identified in normally aging subjects and in patients with senile dementia of the
alzheimer type (table i). drugs which have a normalising effect on some of these disturbances could
thus have potential therapeutic efficacy in age-related cognitive decline.  xxxd2020xxx  is
such an agent since the ergo line moiety common
to the 4 alkaloids of  xxxd2020xxx  has

structural similarities to the monoamine neurotransmitters, dopamine, noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5ht) [fig. 2]. the presence of this moiety in  xxxd2020xxx  is reflected in the multiple effects of the compound on dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin neurotransmitter systems.
the activity of  xxxd2020xxx  at (1'adrenoceptors has been demonstrated by its facilitation of electrically evoked noradrenaline release
(for review see markstein 1985) and its inhibitory
effect on adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline activity in studies using rat, bovine (markstein
et al. 1983) or cat (meier-ruge & iwangoff 1976)
brain. findings from these and in vitro ligand binding studies suggest that the compound is a noncompetitive antagonist at postsynaptic (l'1-adrenoceptors and a competitive antagonist at presynaptic
(l'2-adrenoceptors (markstein 1983; weil 1988), with
a higher affinity for (1'2- than (l'1-adrenoceptors
(markstein et al. 1983). it is also now apparent from
single-unit animal studies that the noradrenaline
neurotransmitter system integrates the activity of
brain structures which modulate cognitive and motor responses to behavioural, environmental, and
physiological challenge (jacobs 1987). thus normalisation of brain noradrenaline activity in humans could be expected to improve cognitive and

157

motor responses in patients with impaired noradrenergic systems.
 xxxd2020xxx  also has marked affinity
for postsynaptic dopamine d i-receptors, and presynaptic dopamine di- and d2-receptors where it
has predominantly agonist activity (weil 1988).
however, there is some evidence for a mixed agonist/antagonist effect at dopamine receptors. for example,  xxxd2020xxx  stimulated rat striatal cyclic- xxxd81xxx  (camp)
formation in a dose dependent manner (a d\-receptor response) suggesting an agonist effect, while
the drug diminished the effect of high dopamine
concentrations (approximately 20 mg/l) on camp
formation indicating an antagonist effect (markstein 1983). in addition, the potent d2-receptor
antagonist spiperone (spiperidol) reverses the dosedependent inhibitory effect of  xxxd2020xxx  0.1 to 1 ng/l on electrically evoked overflow
of tritium from rat striatal slices preincubated with
[3hjcholine, indicating  xxxd2020xxx  has
only partial postsynaptic d2-receptor agonist activity (markstein 1983). evidence of the partial d2receptor agonist effects of  xxxd2020xxx 
is also provided by its effects on prolactin levels in
humans (see section 1.5). as there are similarities
in dopamine neuronal activity across mammalian
species, and dopamine has a permissive rather than
a direct neurotransmitter-like effect on dopamine
neurons in single-unit animal studies (jacobs 1987),
and thus on cognitive function, it is possible that
 xxxd2020xxx  has a similar effect in humans with reduced dopamine levels.

a wide variety of behavioural and physiological
processes in animals are modulated by serotonin
neurons (jacobs 1987). it is now recognised that
 xxxd2020xxx  has marked agonist activity
at 5-hti- and 5-ht2-receptors of rat frontal cortex
membranes, although in the presence of high serotonin concentrations the compound has antagonist
activity (see reviews by markstein 1985; weii1988).
an agonist action of  xxxd2020xxx  on the
serotoninergic system has also been demonstrated
by its direct effect on the sleep cycle, including alterations in the sleep-time awake cycle, and reduction of the number (but not duration) of remsleep phases (weil 1988). thus, there is a theoretical basis for suggesting administration of  xxxd2020xxx  may improve impaired behavioural functions in humans.
dose-related increases in the numbers (amenta
et al. 1989, bertoni-freddari et al. 1987) and surface area (bertoni-freddari et al. 1987) of cholinergic receptors have been observed in elderly rats
given oral  xxxd2020xxx  0.6 to 3 mg/kg/
day for 1 to 6 months. in addition, total contact
area of rat brain hippocampal mossy fibre area increased significantly (p < 0.001) following 4
months' administration of  xxxd2020xxx 
1 to 3 mg/kg/day (amenta et al. 1990). there have
also been reports of increased choline acetyl transferase activity in both the hippocampal and striatal
brain regions in older rats following administration
of oral  xxxd2020xxx  (3 mg/day for 4
weeks; dravid 1983). these indications of positive
effects on hippocampal neurons suggest that co-

dergocrine mesylate may improve the reactive capacity of neurotransmitter systems in the hippocampus (bertoni-freddari et al. 1987) and thus enhance memory function (amenta et al. 1989),
although  xxxd2020xxx  has little affinity
for central cholinergic, histaminergic or /3-adrenergic receptors (weil 1988).  xxxd2020xxx  may, however, have an indirect effect on the
central cholinergic system via its effect on central
camp metabolism (see section 1.3) and subsequent attenuation of age-related reductions in
acetyl- xxxd1739xxx  activity and hence acetyl choline synthesis (see review by meier-ruge 1985).

1.2 electrophysiological effects

available evidence suggests that there is a positive correlation between slowing of electroencephalogram (eeg) frequencies and degree of clinical
impairment in the elderly (matejcek et al. 1986).
slowing of alpha rhythm (8 to 13hz) is known to
occur with increasing age and the dominant eeg
frequencies in older people (aged ~ 60 years) are
more likely to be in the range 6 to 8hz (see reviews
by buchan et al. 1978; loew & weil 1982). in addition, there is a tendency for older inpatients to

 xxxd2020xxx : a review

have more diffuse slow waves in the theta (4 to
7hz) and delta bands « 4hz) [obrist et ai. 1962],
although higher frequencies (mean 9.4hz) have
been recorded in some older subjects (wang et ai.
1970). slowing of alpha and beta activity and increased delta and theta activity have also been recorded in patients with senile dementia of the alzheimer type (saletu et ai. 1990a).
administration of single oral doses of  xxxd2020xxx  5mg diminished and accelerated
slow eeg activity and augmented beta activity in
elderly volunteers, suggesting vigilance promoting
properties, and augmented p300 amplitude of
event-related potentials (saletu et ai. 1989). single
dose  xxxd2020xxx  also decreased delta
and theta activity, and increased beta activity in
the frequency bands adjacent to the alpha band
(saletu et ai. 1990a). findings by other investigators suggest that these eeg changes are maintained
during continued administration of co-dergocrine
mesylate. for example,  xxxd2020xxx  4.5
mg/day for 3 years significantly (p ~ 0.05 vs baseline) increased the dominant eeg frequency of i 17
healthy volunteers aged 52 to 72 years; an initial
increase followed by a sustained decrease in the
power of the slow frequency and alpha bands, and
an increase in the power of the fast beta band (20
to 30hz) occurred. while increases in fast beta band
power were accompanied by decreases in the power
of the slow beta band (i i to 20hz) in the control
group, there was no corresponding reduction in slow
beta frequency power during  xxxd2020xxx  administration (k6berle & spiegel 1984).
increases in alpha frequency of i to 2hz have
been observed in the eeg tracings of small numbers (n ~ 20) of elderly patients with cerebrovascular insufficiency or dementia following administration of single intravenous doses of  xxxd2020xxx  0.3 to 0.9mg (buchan et ai.
1978; tartara et ai. 1974). this acceleration of the
dominant eeg frequency was sustained during
continued therapy with  xxxd2020xxx  4.5
mg/day for 12 weeks in a total of 19 patients with
either cerebrovascular insufficiency or dementia
(arrigo et ai. 1973; matejcek et ai. 1979). administration of higher doses of  xxxd2020xxx 

159

(45 mg/day) for 6 weeks to 19 elderly patients with
dementia has also been associated with increased
alpha and beta power, and decreased theta power
(sebban 1989).
1.3 effects on cerebral metabolism
the effects of  xxxd2020xxx  on cerebral metabolism were first demonstrated in animal
studies which showed that  xxxd2020xxx 
increased cerebral blood flow and oxidative metabolism in monkeys (szewcykowski et ai. 1970)
and improved metabolic parameters of hypoxic cat
brain. in cat brain studies  xxxd2020xxx 
counteracted reductions in electrical activity, oxygen consumption and partial oxygen pressure and
minimised a shift from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism, as demonstrated by a reversal of the hypoxia-induced increase in lactate formation (table
ii). findings that  xxxd2020xxx  had a
reactivating effect on isolated hypothermic cat head
metabolism suggest that these effects resulted from
a central rather than systemic effect (cerletti et ai.
1973).
data from other studies using cat and bovine
brain tissue show that, as expected from its aadrenoceptor antagonist activity (see section 1.2),
 xxxd2020xxx  inhibits noradrenaline
stimulated na+ /k+ -atpase and  xxxg67xxx  activity. in these studies,  xxxd2020xxx 
maintained the neuronal cell level of camp by inhibiting low km phosphodiesterase, the enzyme involved in camp metabolism. it thus appears that
 xxxd2020xxx  has a sparing effect on neuronal atp (meier-ruge & iwangoff 1976).
other studies with aged rats showed that
administration of  xxxd2020xxx  0.1 to 4
mg/kg/day for 4 weeks increased deoxyglucose
reuptake by 30 to 57% (compared with untreated
controls) in brain areas involved with the regulation of dopaminergic, adrenergic, and autonomic
effects (meier-ruge 1986). increased glucose uptake in the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia has
also been demonstrated in patients with multi-infarct dementia following administration of a single

intravenous dose of  xxxd2020xxx  0.04
mg/kg (nagasawa et al. 1990).
in addition, in healthy volunteers a single dose
of  xxxd2020xxx  5mg provided a small but
statistically significant protective effect against
moderate (9.8% 02) but not marked (8.6% 02) hypoxic acidosis (saletu et al. i 990b ).
1.4 effects on cerebral circulation and
platelet function
autoregulatory systems in the brain ensure that
the total blood supply is maintained within normal
limits regardless of any fluctuation in systemic
blood pressure. however, local changes in carbon
dioxide levels and adrenergic impulses appear to
be able to stimulate changes in arteriole diameter
and thus control regional blood flow (weil 1988).
furthermore, cerebral blood flow in the elderly may
be lower than that in younger volunteers (wang et
al. 1970).
 xxxd2020xxx  does not appear to have
any direct effect on cerebral blood flow in patients
with vascular dementia (for example see hartmann 1985; wei i 1988). this is despite it being a
potent a-adrenergic antagonist and possibly reducing platelet activity, as shown by reductions in
thromboxane b2 levels and platelet protein activity, depressed adp-induced platelet aggregation
(sinzinger 1985), and inhibition of in vitro adrenaline-induced platelet aggregation (santos & rodrigues 1990).

1.5 effects on pituitary secretion
elderly patients with dementia appear to have
higher prolactin levels than similarly aged healthy
volunteers (samorajski et al. 1982). co-dergocrine
mesylate may normalise prolactin levels by inhibiting prolactin release from the pituitary since at
high dopamine concentrations it has an antagonist
effect (see section 1.2). indeed, administration of
 xxxd2020xxx  4.5 to 13.5 mg/day for 4 to
20 weeks significantly decreased (p < 0.05 vs placebo) prolactin levels in patients with dementia (ei
sobky et al. 1986; samorajski et al. 1982), age-related cognitive decline (gross et al. 1979) or cerebral insufficiency (rolandi et ai, 1983). small but
significant increases in growth hormone levels were
observed in patients with cerebral insufficiency receiving  xxxd2020xxx  6 mg/day for i
month (rolandi et al. 1983).
1.6 effects on cognition and behaviour
1.6.1 animal studies
in vivo,  xxxd2020xxx  administration
has been associated with improved learning and
memory, and altered behaviour. for example, oral,
intraperitoneal or subcutaneous administration of
 xxxd2020xxx  i to 10 mg/kg/day daily for
4 days partially corrected age-related deterioration
of spatiotemporal performance (le poncin-lafitte
et al. 1983) and significantly improved maze performance by reducing the number of errors and long
range movements of old rats (see review by weil
1988).  xxxd2020xxx  also enhanced self-

 xxxd2020xxx : a review

stimulation (copeland et al. 1981; poschel &
ninteman 1981) and spontaneous motor activity
(copeland et al. 1981) but had no effect on motor
activity or induction of stereotype behaviour in
other rat behavioural tests (poschel & ninteman
1981). the effects on self-stimulation and spontaneous motor activity corresponded to increased levels of noradrenaline and dopamine, and decreased
serotonin levels in the pons-medulla, indicating that
the behavioural effects of  xxxd2020xxx 
may be associated with neurochemical changes
(copeland et al. 1981).
administration of  xxxd2020xxx  in
mice has been associated with indices of retention
and memory such as enhanced habituation of exploratory activity, improved retention of active
avoidance training (flood et al. 1985; plate i & porsolt 1982) and reversal of  xxxd183xxx -induced amnesia (j udge & quartermain 1981). the latter finding suggests that  xxxd2020xxx  may
facilitate memory retrieval, particularly as there was
no relationship between movement and dopamine
activity in single-unit animal studies (jacobs 1987).

1.6.2 human studies
parameters of arousal and alertness, such as
critical flicker-fusion thresholds and subjective rating scale scores, improved in healthy volunteers
during oral administration of  xxxd2020xxx  12 mg/day for 2 weeks in an uncontrolled
study (hindmarch et al. 1979). cognitive processing time and psychomotor performance during the
completion of complex tasks were also improved.
in contrast, there were no statistically significant
differences in therapeutic outcomes in healthy elderly volunteers who received  xxxd2020xxx  (1.5mg 3 times daily) or placebo for 5 years
(huber et al. 1986). interestingly, in this long term
study, 9 of the 13 participants who were withdrawn
following the development of cognitive dysfunction and subsequently treated with co-dergocrine
mesylate had improved symptoms.
in experimentally induced hypoxic acidosis (induced by inhalation of 9.8% 02) deterioration of
psychometric performance was greater after placebo (-49%) than after single doses of co-dergo-

crine mesylate 5mg (-26%). however, neither single
nor repeated (up to 2 weeks)  xxxd2020xxx  administration had a protective effect against
marked hypoxic acidosis (during inhalation of 8.6%
02) [saletu et al. i 990b ].
1.7 mechanism of action
the nature of age-related cognitive decline remains an elusive concept. impairment of sensorimotor processing, recent memory, concept formation, vi suo spatial praxis and/or attention, and
lack of impairment in more remote memory and
linguistic ability (except verbal fluency) are features of age-related cognitive decline and, to a lesser
extent, very mild dementia. further confounding
the issue is the possibility that patients with dementia may have been included with normally aging volunteers in pharmacodynamic studies. for
example, abnormal electrophysiological parameters reported in some elderly volunteers are similar
to those observed in patients with alzheimer's disease (see section 1.2). however, despite the overlap
in symptoms between age-related cognitive decline
and dementia the 2 disorders are currently thought
to be separate as impairment in visual acuity and
visuoperceptual ability are associated with normal
aging, while impaired language and remote memory are features of early dementia (albert 1990;
flicker et al. 1986).
reductions in cerebral levels of noradrenaline,
dopamine and serotonin are also associated with
normal aging and with dementia (see section 1.1)
and it is also now apparent that the activity of enzymes associated with monoamine metabolism is
altered in normally aging individuals. furthermore, there is evidence from animal behavioural
studies that learning and memory, sleep/wake
cycles, alertness and mobility are regulated by the
3 monoamines (noradrenaline, dopamine, and
serotonin) [see section 1.1].
 xxxd2020xxx  appears to have a dual
effect on these neurotransmitter systems compensating for both under- and over-activity of adrenergic, dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems
(section 1.1), and thus may have a normalising ef-

fect on neurotransmitter disturbances of elderly
patients with cognitive impairment. evidence from
animal studies also suggests  xxxd2020xxx 
may improve cerebral metabolism (see section 1.3)
and may compensate for a pathological decline in
glucose turnover. as metabolic dysfunction is associated with cognitive impairment in many elderly patients (buchan et al. 1978; hoyer et al.
1977) the effects\of  xxxd2020xxx  on cerebral metabolism may be beneficial.

2. pharmacokinetic properties
 xxxd2020xxx  is incompletely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract resulting in
low concentrations in body fluids. since chemical
assay methods lack the sensitivity to determine such
low concentrations, the pharmacokinetic parameters of  xxxd2020xxx  in healthy volunteers
have been determined using radioactive labelling,
radioimmuno- or radioreceptor assays. in these
studies approximately 25% of the administered oral
dose was absorbed (aellig & niiesch 1977). following oral doses of standard formulations of 1 to
6 mg in volunteers a maximum plasma concentration of between 0.5 and 1.2 ilg/l was achieved
within 0.5 to 2.3 hours, and plasma elimination
half-life was 1.5 to 4.1 hours (aellig & niiesch 1977;
humbert et al. 1981; segre et al. 1983). higher
plasma concentrations (2 to 2.5 mg/l) have been
achieved with repeated doses in elderly patients
(sorgel et al. 1984) [fig. 3].
 xxxd2020xxx  has been detected in the
granular layer of the cortex, cerebellum, basal ganglion and neuronal cells of the reticular formation
of cat brain. findings from other animal studies
suggest that approximately 60% of cerebral  xxxd2020xxx  is localised in the synaptic structures (iwangoff et al. 1976). the main elimination
route of the  xxxd2020xxx  alkaloids is via
biliary excretion (nimmerfall & rosenthaler 1976)
and the hepatic first-pass effect is approximately
50% (data on file, sandoz). metabolites of dihydro{3-ergocryptine have been identified, including dihydrolysergic acid and several hydroxylation products (see review by eckert et al. 1978). in healthy

volunteers 2% or less of an oral dose and 8 to 9%
of an intravenous dose is excreted via the urine
(aellig & niiesch 1977).
in elderly volunteers (aged 66 to 86 years) total
plasma clearance of  xxxd2020xxx  was reduced by approximately 30% compared with that
in younger adults (22 to 34 years), and bioavailability was increased by 2.5-fold, possibly as a result
of decreased hepatic blood flow and thus a decreased extraction ratio (lavene et al. 1985). in the
older group urinary  xxxd2020xxx  clearance was reduced by approximately 50% although,
as a relatively small proportion of co-dergocrine
mesylate is excreted in the urine, this latter finding
has little clinical significance (lavene et al. 1985).

3. therapeutic efficacy in age-related
cognitive decline
many older persons have declining intellectual
function with increasing age, although in any given
age group there are considerable variations in intellectual change (see review by wang et al. 1970).
impaired cerebral circulation is also associated with
increasing age. however, while between 8 and 29%
of elderly patients with declining mental function
have cerebral insufficiencies of vascular origin (including multi-infarct dementia) [cummings & jarvik 1990], it is apparent that cerebral ischaemia is
not a primary factor in the development of mental
decline in the elderly (tomlinson et al. 1970).

163

 xxxd2020xxx : a review

moreover, cogmtive deficits are also present in
patients with alzheimer's disease and those with
age-associated memory impairment and it is possible that these diseases are a continuum rather than
separate disorders, although age-associated memory impairment has been described as memory loss
without dementia (crook 1988). thus, the inclusion of patients with vascular ischaemia, and the
difficulties in qualitative discrimination between
normal aging and dementia, have confounded attempts to compare results from different clinical
studies in which  xxxd2020xxx  has been
assessed.
the plethora of memory and mental function
tests available for patient assessment, the subjective nature of many of these tests and the problem
of patient compliance in community based studies,
have also contributed to difficulties in obtaining an
overall view of the efficacy of  xxxd2020xxx  in the treatment of age-related cognitive decline. reports as early as 1956 demonstrated that
therapy with  xxxd2020xxx  had a greater
positive effect on symptoms of age-related cognitive decline than placebo (hofstatter et al. 1956)
and previous reviews of controlled studies using
standardised rating scales have shown that  xxxd2020xxx  therapy (1 or 1.5mg 3 times daily
in most studies) was associated with consistent and
statistically significant improvements in symptoms
of cognitive decline such as mental dullness, disorientation, confusion, recent memory loss and
mood depression (hughes et al. 1976; mcdonald
1979). there is, however, continuing controversy
over the clinical significance of these results.
3.1 noncomparative and
dose-finding studies
findings from 2 nonblind noncomparative
studies involving several thousand patients with
age-related cognitive decline have confirmed the
trends observed in earlier controlled studies.
therapy with  xxxd2020xxx  4.5 mg/day
for 12 weeks improved symptoms of cognitive dysfunction, agitation/irritability, mood depression,
and withdrawal in 4388 patients (mean age 63

clinical assessment-geriatric (scag; table iii)
scale improved and 34% of patients had an overall
impression score improvement of i to 3 points (de
mattos filho & zilenovski 1987). greater improvements were obtained in 2438 elderly patients
with cerebral insufficiency (mean age 70 years)
during longer term treatment (i year) using  xxxd2020xxx  1.5mg 3 times daily, although
these results included data for 934 patients with
impaired mental or behavioural function associated with cerebrovascular disorders (wolmark &
loria 1986). using a 7-point scale for scoring 8
items (mental alertness, recent memory, orientation/confusion, motivation mood, sociability, dizziness and tinnitus) 75% of all participants had a
5-point improvement in overall score, and a further 15% had an improvement of at least 3 points.
data from a dose finding study have shown a
trend towards greater efficacy for co-dergocrine
mesylate 6 mg/day than 3 mg/day in ii elderly
patients with moderate dementia treated for 12
weeks, although this difference was not significant
(yesavage & adey 1980).
3.2 comparisons with placebo
while analyses of findings from controlled assessments of the effects of  xxxd2020xxx 
3 to 4.5 mg/day during the decade from 1969 to

ures used in most earlier studies, and the small
patient popuiatioll of many studies (mean n = 53,
range 18 to 204) makes any overall generalisation
difficult. meta-analysis of results from total scores
on comprehensive rating scales (44 trials), clinical
global ratings (23 trials) and combined cognitive/
neuropsychological measures (22 trials) showed a
statistically significant effect size (p = 0.0001) in
favour of  xxxd2020xxx . there was an inverse relationship between effect size and publication date in trials using comprehensive rating
scales (p = 0.06) and combined cognitive/neuropsychological measures (p = 0.02), although most
studies were reported prior to 1975. there was also

=

a greater effect on cognitive/neuropsychological
measures for doses of 4.5 to 6 mg/day than 3 mg/
day or less. however, overall, there was a tendency
for greater improvements in patients with known
vascular dementia, and treatment with  xxxd2020xxx  tended to improve behavioural
measures more than cognitive performance (unpublished data on file, sandoz). in addition, the
meta-analysis revealed a significant inverse relationship between effect size and treatment duration for trials using global clinical ratings (p = 0.05)
and cognitive/neuropsychological measures (p =
0.04). however, these findings contrast with those
of a separate retrospective analysis of many of the

166

same studies which revealed that while results from
controlled placebo comparisons of 6 months or less
may not have been impressive, pronounced clinical
effects have been observed in studies oflonger duration (fanchamps 1983). a positive correlation between clinical improvements and normalisation of
eeg frequency in patients with age-related cognitive decline has been reported in some studies (arrigo et al. 1973; matejcek et al. 1979).
several of the many factors confounding attempts to obtain an overview of the efficacy of  xxxd2020xxx  in patients with age-related
cognitive decline have, to some extent, been addressed in studies published since 1979. in most
of these the key symptoms of cognitive dysfunction
were assessed by evaluating indicators of confusion, lack of mental alertness, impaired recent
memory, disorientation and lack of self care. many
studies also investigated factors of agitation/irritability, mood depression, withdrawal from society,
physical symptoms and mental status. the scag
scale was the scale used most frequently to assess
symptoms, although other assessment scales have
also been used (table iv). most of these studies had
well defined inclusion criteria, studying only
patients with mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment and excluding patients with dementia of
known vascular origin.
overall assessment of results using a combination of different scales, including scag, demonstrated that  xxxd2020xxx  therapy was associated with statistically significant (p ~ 0.05 vs
baseline or placebo) improvements in cognitive
dysfunction, agitation/irritability, mood depression, withdrawal and physical symptoms, even
though the actual quantitative changes achieved
tended to be small (brage & brage 1984; cox 1982;
exton-smith et al. 1982; rouy et al. 1989; yesavage et al. 1981: table iv). nonetheless, a 30% improvement in the cognition factor score, a 57% improvement in the withdrawal factor score (scag
scale) and a shift from severe to moderate status
(p ~ 0.01 vs placebo) for lack of initiative, sociability and emotional lability factors [assessed using
the geriatric rating scale (bronx hospital)] were
achieved during  xxxd2020xxx  therapy in

drugs & aging 2 (3) 1992

a one year study (chierichetti et al. 1985).
however, while standardised rating scales were
used to assess treatment effects in these studies
(table iv) there was no overall consistency in diagnosis of patients' cognitive dysfunction, actual
symptoms assessed, presentation of data, or results. although 9 of the 14 investigating groups used
the scag scale to assess symptoms only 4 presented results for the key scag scale symptoms
of cognitive dysfunction (impaired recent memory,
confusion, lack of mental alertness, disorientation,
lack of self care) [chudnovsky 1979; cox 1982;
hollingsworth 1980; van loveren-huyben et al.
1984] and only 1 reported quantitative results (van
loveren-huyben et al. 1984). furthermore, only 2
studies demonstrated statistically significant improvements in recent memory (cox 1982; hollingsworth 1980), only 1 reported statistically significant improvements in confusion, mental
alertness, and disorientation (cox 1982), and no
group reported improvements in scag scale assessments of lack of self care. two investigators
did, however, report improvements in overall
scag scale assessment of the key symptoms of
cognitive dysfunction (chierichetti et al. 1985;
thienhaus et al. 1987) although neither study gave
details of quantitative results. nonetheless, in a 24week study in 48 patients with mild-to-moderate
age-related cognitive decline 39% of patients receiving active treatment had improved symptoms
(vs 0% of placebo recipients; p ~ 0.01) [fig. 4], 50%
of  xxxd2020xxx  recipients had 4- to 5point improvements on the scag scale, and all
but 2 patients had improvements of 1 to 5 points
(van loveren-huyben et al. 1984).
interestingly, during the first 4 months of treatment in longer term studies (6 to 12 months) improvements in some individual factor classifications (e.g improved digit symbol substitution test,
irritability, confusion, mental alertness, recent
memory, depression, emotional lability, or dizziness) were also observed for placebo recipients, although, with the exception of improved depression, these changes were not significant. moreover,
initial improvements were generally not maintained and a gradual deterioration in factor scores

demonstrated that performances by patients treated

questioned by other investigators (baer & jenike
1991; posner & landsberg 1991).

was observed during the remaining study months
in placebo recipients (chierichetti et al. 1985; rouy
et al. 1989; van loveren-huyben et al. 1984).
in addition to the lack of consistency of the effects of  xxxd2020xxx  in patients with agerelated cognitive decline there is also conflicting
evidence on the effect of such therapy in patients
with diagnosis of primary dementia or senile dementia of the alzheimer type. in a 12-month placebo controlled study of 53 patients with alzheimer's disease, active treatment with  xxxd2020xxx  9 mg/day was associated with
beneficial improvements in social functioning
(puxty 1989). moreover, after 12-months' therapy,
deteriorations in delayed recall and self care were
observed in the placebo group but not in those receiving active treatment, and there were significant
differences in favour of  xxxd2020xxx  between the 2 treatment groups in tests of memory
and cognitive function. there was also a trend towards greater efficacy for  xxxd2020xxx 
than placebo in patients with mild-to-moderate
primary dementia (theinhaus et al. 1987). in contrast, data from a recent 24-week study of 80

in past decades, a wide variety of drugs have
been studied in patients with cognitive decline, and
 xxxd2020xxx  has been compared with
many of these agents. most of these studies are of
historical interest only. for example, in a series of
comparisons with papaverine in the i 970s,  xxxd2020xxx  consistently showed greater efficacy (p .::> 0.05; bazo 1973; nelson 1975; rosen
1975; winslow 1974), while in the 1980s it was
compared with a variety of other agents in studies
involving groups of 30 to 68 patients with age-related cognitive decline. these have included comparisons with the peripheral vasodilators buflomedii (bastos et al. 1980; jansen et al. 1985), and
suloctidil (ba1estereri et al. 1984), and a variety of
centrally acting drugs including amantadine (bavazzano et al. 1980), chlordiazepoxide (oswald &
lang 1980),  xxxd1704xxx  (desimirovic et al. 1988),
methyldopa (bergamasco et al. 1987), naftidrofuryl
(knox et al. 1984) and  xxxd2719xxx  (kugler & meurer-krull 1985) but results were equivocal.
more recently, a number of other drugs have
emerged with claimed efficacy in patients with cognitive decline. these have included cholinesterase
inhibitors such as physostigmine and tacrine,
acetylcholine precursors, cholinergic agonists (see
review by davidson et al. 1991) and nootropic
agents such as piracetam (see review by vernon &
sorkin 1991).  xxxd2020xxx  has not been
compared with most of these compounds. however, findings from a preliminary 6-week comparison of the efficacy of  xxxd2020xxx  (6
mg/day) and piracetam (2.4 g/day) in patients with

a diagnosis of cerebral insufficiency showed that
although both patient groups had improved cognitive performances after 3 weeks' therapy, only
patients treated with  xxxd2020xxx  maintained initial improvements in niirenburg geriatric inventory scores for a further 3 weeks (oswald et at. 1982).

4. tolerability
 xxxd2020xxx  has been well tolerated
in patients with age-related cognitive decline with
few participants in controlled studies developing
adverse events related to therapy. pooling of results from 26 controlled studies comparing  xxxd2020xxx  with either placebo or papaverine
revealed that active therapy was withdrawn from
only 2 of 732 patients treated with co-dergocrine
mesylate 1.5 to 4.5 mg/day for 4 to 14 weeks: 1
patient had palpitations and the other head pain
(mcdonald 1979).
in larger nonblind studies of 12 to 24 weeks'
duration gastrointestinal disturbances (including
nausea, gastric upset, anorexia, abdominal pain and
vomiting) were the most frequently reported ad-

verse effects followed by dizziness, vertigo, headache, nasal stuffiness, drowsiness, sleep disorders,
and restlessness (fig. 5). approximately 50% of these
disturbances resolved spontaneously during
therapy. in a i-year study of 2438 patients treated
with  xxxd2020xxx  4.5 mg/day the overall
incidence of adverse events was 14.4% after 6
months of therapy and 9.1% after 12 months (wolmark & loria 1986).
in placebo-controlled studies both treatment
groups had a similar overall incidence of adverse
events; in i study of 137 patients with cerebral insufficiency 11 to 25% of the  xxxd2020xxx 
group and 15 to 20% of the placebo group reported
adverse events including gastrointestinal disturbances, orthostatic disturbances and pruritus (lazzari et at. 1983) and in a separate study of 100
patients with mild-to-moderate mental dysfunction adverse events were reported by 4  xxxd2020xxx  treated patients and 6 placebo recipients (chudnovsky 1979). there have also been
reports of bradycardia and precordial discomfort
associated with a  xxxd2020xxx  dosage of
4.5 mg/day. bradycardia was observed in 3 of 8

patients in 1 study (dcayley et al. 1975), and precordial discomfort was reported by 3 of 590 patients
during the first 12 weeks of a 24 week study (data
on file, sandoz).
hypotension or nausea were not observed during a 6-week study of the electrophysiological effects of  xxxd2020xxx  45 mg/day in 19
elderly patients with dementia (sebban 1989), nor
were adverse events reported in a total of 31
patients receiving 9 mg/day for 3 to 9 weeks (exton-smith et al. 1982; knox et al. 1984). however,
5 of 14 elderly patients with hypertension treated
with  xxxd2020xxx  9 to 13.5 mg/day reported adverse events including headache (n = 4)
and gastrointestinal disturbance (1) [bergamasco et
al. 1987]. in a separate study of 57 patients treated
with  xxxd2020xxx  6 to 12 mg/day, gastrointestinal disturbances, restlessness, and dizziness were each reported by i patient (schardt &
dennler 1982).

5. dosage and administration
the usual dosage of  xxxd2020xxx  for
the long term treatment of patients with mild-tomoderate symptoms of age-related cognitive decline is i to l.5mg 3 times daily (administered
orally), although daily dosages of up to 13.5mg have
been used in clinical studies. therapy with  xxxd2020xxx  should be initiated once other
causes of dementia are excluded.

6. place of  xxxd2020xxx 
in therapy
age-related cognitive decline is a major component of the aging problem as it interacts with,
and magnifies, the social, psychological, economical, and biological problems of aging. as the percentage of the elderly in the total population continues to rise there is increasing need for an effective
therapy for this disorder which develops in approximately 10% of people over the age of 65 (hollister 1987) and is frequently manifested by symptoms of recent memory loss, mental dullness,
disorientation, and lack of self care. in addition,

169

many such patients already have inadequate
healthcare (bergmann 1985).
clearly, medication able to relieve the broad
spectrum of symptoms which develop with gradual
progression of cognitive dysfunction, particularly
memory loss. would be invaluable, not only for
those affected patients but also for the carers and
healthcare systems that carry this growing financial
burden.
in the past 2 decades there has been considerable debate regarding the clinical usefulness of  xxxd2020xxx  in such indications (see reviews by hughes et al. 1976; mcdonald 1979; yesavage et al. 1979) despite demonstration of small
but consistently statistically significant improvements in patients with age-related cognitive decline. more recent studies, such as one which demonstrated that  xxxd2020xxx  had no
beneficial effects in patients with alzheimer's disease (thompson et al. 1990) and which generated
considerable comment on the relevance of the
chosen study design and data analysis, have done
little to resolve this controversy, despite their use
of standardised assessment scales and their longer
treatment duration. adequately designed studies in
large populations are therefore needed to fully determine  xxxd2020xxx 's efficacy in patients
with alzheimer's disease.
further confounding the issue is the lack of consensus on an established definition for age-related
cognitive decline (and consequently the absence of
any diagnostic criteria for this disorder) during the
period most studies were conducted, although a
definition for age-associated memory impairment,
which excludes patients with evidence of delirium,
confusion. other disturbances of consciousness or
any neurological or medical disorder likely to impair cognitive function, has now been proposed
(crook 1988; crook et al. 1986). treatment of dementia is also dependent on confirmed diagnosis
(whalley & bradnock 1990), however, there is considerable variation in diagnosis of patients with dementia and it is possible that symptoms of mildto-moderate dementia are early manifestations of
alzheimer's disease (crook 1988). thus is is difficult to draw any clinically useful conclusions about

170

the effectiveness of  xxxd2020xxx  in ameliorating symptoms of age-related cognitive dysfunction.
some symptoms of cognitive dysfunction can
be controlled or alleviated with antipsychotic. antidepressant or antianxiety drugs; however. most of
these drugs have been associated with the development of adverse events such as extrapyramidal
reactions, orthostatic hypotension. cardiotoxicity
or confusion (hollister 1985, 1987) and it would
be difficult to justify their use in patients with only
mild dementias. in the last decade a number of
other drugs have been used to treat symptoms of
cognitive dysfunction. including tacrine, physostigmine (davidson et al. 1991) and piracetam (vernon & sorkin 1991). although there is preliminary
evidence that  xxxd2020xxx  has a greater
effect on cognitive performance than piracetam it
has not been compared with most of these drugs.
thus, although findings from placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated that  xxxd2020xxx  is well tolerated and, in some instances exerted a small but statistically significant
positive effect on some of the symptoms of agerelated cognitive decline, the place of co-dergocrine
mesylate within the increasingly wide range of
agents with potential cognitive enhancing abilities
has yet to be established.
