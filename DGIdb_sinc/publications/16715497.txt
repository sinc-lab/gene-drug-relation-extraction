abstract
preincubation of striatal slices with the selective histamine h3-receptor agonist immepip (100 nm) decreased the speciﬁc binding of n-a-[methyl-3h]-histamine ([3h]-nmha) to membranes obtained from the treated slices. the binding
decrease was signiﬁcant after 5 min, remained at similar reduced levels between 5and 30-min incubations with agonist, and only a partial recovery was observed after
90-min washout (34, 41, and 44% at 90, 120, and 150 min, respectively). saturation
analysis showed a signiﬁcant decrease in both receptor density (44% 6 9%) and afﬁnity (dissociation constant, kd 1.15 6 0.23 nm from 0.59 6 0.17 nm). the effect of
immepip was mimicked by histamine and the h3 agonists imetit and r-a-methylhistamine, and was blocked by the h3 antagonist thioperamide. the reduction in [3h]nmha binding was fully and partially prevented by incubation at 48c and in hypertonic medium, respectively, but not by the endocytosis inhibitor phenylarsine oxide (10
lm). none of the following protein kinase inhibitors, ro-318220 and gö-6976 (pkc),
 xxxd477xxx  (pka) and  xxxd3241xxx  (general inhibitor) prevented the effect of immepip. in
[3h]-adenine-labeled slices the preincubation with immepip (100 nm, 15 min) prevented the inhibitory effect of h3 receptor activation on  xxxd1742xxx -induced [3h]-camp
accumulation (99% 6 9% vs. 76% 6 4% of control values). taken together our results
indicate that agonist binding promotes the down-regulation of striatal h3 receptors
resulting in a signiﬁcant loss of function. synapse 60:165–171, 2006. v 2006 wiley-liss, inc.

introduction
histamine regulates pre- and postsynaptically a
number of brain functions, through interaction with g
protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs). to date four such
receptors (h1–h4) have been cloned, and three of them
(h1, h2, and h3) are widely distributed in the mammalian central nervous system (haas and panula, 2003).
histamine h3 receptors are expressed primarily on
nerve terminals, where they regulate the release of histamine itself and that of other neurotransmitters
(brown et al., 2001). in the striatum, a neuronal nucleus with one of the highest h3 receptor densities in
both human rat brain (martı́nez-mir et al., 1990; pillot
et al., 2002), these receptors are also postsynaptic
(pillot et al., 2002; pollard et al., 1993; ryu et al., 1994,
1996).
one widely studied form of gpcr regulation is that
of agonist-induced (‘‘homologous’’), in which agonist occupancy of the receptor promotes its phosphorylation
by g protein-coupled receptor kinases (grks). once
phosphorylated by a grk, the activated receptor is

bound by a member of another protein family, the
arrestins, which dampen further g protein activation
in spite of the continued stimulation of the receptor by
agonist. in addition to this role as a receptor desensitization mechanism, the grk-arrestin system also
serves to promote the internalization of inactivated
receptors through clathrin-coated pits into endosomes
where the receptor may undergo dephosphorylation
and recycling to the cell surface, or be degraded via a
lysosomal pathway (gainentdinov et al., 2004).
previous studies on guinea-pig intestine (perez-garcia et al., 1998) showed the inhibitory effect of h3 agonists on electrically evoked twitches to be reduced in a

second application, suggesting that peripheral h3
receptors desensitize. further, a preliminary report
indicates that for the human h3 receptor transfected
into cho-k1 cells internalization may occur, although
at a very slow pace, reaching a maximum at 90-min
stimulation (powell and hill, 2003). since there is no
information regarding whether native brain h3 receptors undergo desensitization, we set out to study the
effect of receptor activation on the binding of n-a[methyl-3h]-histamine ([3h]-nmha) to membranes
obtained from rat striatal slices previously exposed to
h3 agonists.

materials and methods
tissue preparation
rats (males, wistar strain, 250–300 g) bred in the
cinvestav facilities were used through out. all procedures were in accordance to the ‘‘guide for the care and
use of laboratory animals’’ of the mexican council for
animal care, and approved by the cinvestav animal
care committee. animals were killed by decapitation,
the brain was quickly removed from the skull,
immersed in ice-cold krebs-henseleit (kh) solution,
and coronal slices (350 lm thick) were obtained with a
vibratome (campden instruments, loughborough, uk).
striatal discs (3-mm diameter) were punched out from
the brain slices. the composition of the kh solution
was (mm) as follows: nacl, 124.5; kcl 3,  xxxd2534xxx , 1;
kh2po4, 1.2; nahco3, 16.5; cacl2, 1.8; d-glucose, 11;
and ph, 7.4 after saturation with o2/co2 (95:5% v:v).

slice treatments
after equilibration for 60 min in kh medium (378c,
with several changes of solution), striatal tissues were
exposed to different treatments. for most experiments
slices were transferred to plastic tubes (3–6 slices per
tube) containing 1 ml kh medium. drugs were added
in a 10-ll volume and the mixtures incubated at 378c
for the indicated times. adding 2 ml of ice-cold kh solution and then aspirating the medium terminated the
incubations. slices were rinsed with prewarmed kh
solution (3 3 3-ml washes) and then quick-frozen on
dry ice.
for recovery experiments, slices were incubated
(378c) in 100-ml kh medium to which immepip was
added. after 15 min, the slices were washed with prewarmed kh solution (3 3 100-ml washes) and incubated in the same medium (100 ml) for the indicated
times before being transferred to tubes where the solution was aspirated and 2 ml ice-cold kh medium
added. tissues were then processed as aforementioned.
for incubation in hypertonic buffer, 400 mm sucrose
was added to the kh solution.

[3h]-nmha binding assay
tissues were placed in 4 ml 10 mm tris-hcl buffer
containing 1 mm egta (ph 7.4) and homogenized
using 12 strokes of a hand-held homogenizer. the homogenate was brought up to 15 ml and centrifuged
(20,000g, 20 min at 48c). the pellet was resuspended
in 15 ml 50 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.4) and centrifuged
again. the resulting pellet (crude membrane preparation) was resuspended in incubation buffer (50 mm
tris-hcl, 5 mm mgcl2, ph 7.4). aliquots were incubated (45 min, 308c) in 0.5 ml buffer containing [3h]nmha (1.25 nm for single-point determinations or
0.01–10 nm for saturation experiments). incubations
were terminated by rapid ﬁltration under vacuum
through whatman gf/b glass ﬁber paper, presoaked
in 0.3% polyethylenimine. nonspeciﬁc binding was
deﬁned as that insensitive to 10 lm histamine. protein
contents were determined according to bradford (1976)
and these data used to estimate receptor binding as
fmol/mg protein.
measurement of cyclic [3h]-amp accumulation
in striatal slices
the accumulation of cyclic [3h]-amp ([3h]-camp) in
[ h]-adenine-labeled striatal slices (3 mm discs,
350 lm thick) was measured essentially as described in
detail elsewhere (sánchez-lemus and arias-montaño,
2004).

incubation of the slices with the selective h3 agonist
immepip (100 nm) resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in
speciﬁc [3h]-nmha binding to membranes obtained
from those slices (fig. 1). [3h]-nmha binding was signiﬁcantly different from controls after 5 min (50% 6

(no drugs added) showed no signiﬁcant change between
0 and 30 min. when the agonist was washed out and
the slices incubated in fresh medium no signiﬁcant
changes were observed between 0 and 60 min (fig. 2),
and only a partial recovery in [3h]-nmha binding was
detected after 90 min (34, 44, and 41% recovery at 90,
120, and 150 min, respectively).
the reduction in [3h]-nmha binding induced by
immepip (100 nm, 15 min incubation, 62% 6 4% inhibition for this series of experiments) was mimicked,
although to a different extent, by histamine and the h3
agonists imetit and r-a-methyl-histamine (fig. 3a).
further, the selective h3 antagonist thioperamide
(10 lm, 10 min before immepip) prevented in a signiﬁcant manner (81% 6 7% inhibition) the immepip effect
on [3h]-nmha binding (fig. 3b).
saturation assays (fig. 4) showed that preincubation
with immepip (100 nm, 15 min) reduced maximum
binding (bmax) from 109 6 13 to 62 6 4 fmol/mg protein
(44 6 9% reduction, n ¼ 4) and increased the kd estimate in all four experiments (means 1.15 6 0.17 nm
from 0.59 6 0.14 nm). the decrease in both bmax and
afﬁnity reached statistical signiﬁcance when compared
with control values (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively, student’s unpaired t-test).

of experiments (fig. 5b) incubation in hypertonic medium (0.4 m sucrose added) prevented the immepip
effect in a partial but signiﬁcant manner (45% 6 3%

we next tested the effect of a number of kinase inhibitors on the immepip-induced reduction in [3h]-nmha
binding. figure 6 shows that none of the drugs tested,
ro-318220 and gö-6976 (200 nm, pkc),  xxxd477xxx  (1 lm,

the main ﬁnding of this work is that exposure of
striatal slices to h3 agonists results in a signiﬁcant
decrease in [3h]-nmha binding sites alongside a signiﬁcant but modest (2-fold) reduction in afﬁnity, the
simplest interpretation being that h3 receptors downregulate upon agonist binding and receptor activation.
the immepip-induced reduction in radioligand binding
was signiﬁcantly prevented by thioperamide, a selective h3 antagonist (leurs et al., 1995), conﬁrming that
down-regulation is receptor homologous.
it could be argued that the agonist-induced decrease
in [3h]-nmha binding was related, at least to some
extent, to the permanence in the membrane preparation of h3 ligands capable to compete with the radioligand for binding to the receptor. although unlikely
given the rinsing and homogenization procedures that
followed the incubations, this possibility was also ruled
out by the thioperamide experiments, in which the
binding reduction was substantially prevented in spite
of the concentration of h3 ligands being 100-fold that of
the immepip experiments.
in homologous desensitization agonist occupancy of
the receptor promotes its phosphorylation by grks
and arrestin binding. arrestins dampen the interaction
between the receptor and its cognate g protein (gainentdinov et al., 2004), which affects ligand binding as

afﬁnity could be held responsible for the reduction in
radioligand binding. however, the estimated change in
receptor occupancy for 1.25 nm [3h]-nmha (down to
52% from 67%) cannot fully account for the extent of inhibition observed in our experiments. further, saturation experiments showed a decrease in bmax, making a
strong argument for an actual reduction in receptor
levels. on the other hand, albeit statistically signiﬁcant the decrease in agonist afﬁnity may have little
effect by itself on histamine binding under physiological conditions given the high afﬁnity of h3 receptors for

concentration reported for the striatum in the same
species under resting conditions (50 nm, cumming
et al., 1991).
endocytosed receptors may undergo dephosphorylation and recycling to the cell surface or be degraded
via lysosomal and nonlysosomal pathways (gainentdinov et al., 2004; von zastrow, 2001, 2003). supporting
a role for internalization in h3 receptor down-regulation, the immepip-induced reduction in [3h]-nmha
binding was prevented fully by incubation at 48c and
partially by hypertonic medium, shown to block receptor endocytosis in a number of systems (boudin et al.,
2000; heuser and anderson, 1989). in contrast, the
endocytosis inhibitor pao did not prevent the immepip
effect. however, pao also reduced the control binding
in a signiﬁcant manner, hampering the interpretation
of this result. on the other hand, pao-sensitive and
-insensitive pathways have been reported (gray et al.,
2001; kato et al., 1992) and the pao effects also appear
to be cell type-speciﬁc, since in some cell lines, such as
c6 glioma cells, the drug even enhances receptor
desensitization (gray et al., 2001). moreover, distinct
gpcrs differ in their ability to undergo clathrin-mediated internalization, and there is evidence that for
some receptors, such as the b2-adrenoceptor and v2 vasopressin receptor, regulated proteolysis can occur
without endocytosis (von zastrow, 2001). the reduction
in bmax alongside the lack of resensitization between 0
and 60 min and partial recovery after 90 min observed
in our experiments suggest that protein degradation
follows h3 receptor internalization. similarly, for spinal cord slices down-regulation of neurokinin-1 receptors occurs within a few minutes with full recovery after 60–90 min (wang and marvizon, 2002).
grk-mediated gpcr phosphorylation has been
demonstrated to occur on speciﬁc residues in the cytoplasmic carboxyl tail or the third intracellular loop of
several receptors. however, the analysis of grk
actions in native tissues is hampered by the lack of
selective inhibitors. on the other hand, the h3 receptor
possesses consensus sites for phosphorylation by protein kinases c (pkc) and a (pka). upon activation,
transfected h3 receptors are capable to stimulate phospholipase c, leading to the activation of the ca2þ/pkc
pathway (coge et al., 2001). we therefore tested the
effect of two pkc inhibitors, ro-318220 and gö-6970,
as well of that of the general kinase inhibitor  xxxd3241xxx  on the immepip-induced reduction in [3h]nmha binding. the effect of a pka inhibitor ( xxxd477xxx )
was also tested, although h3 receptors inhibit camp
formation and therefore should decrease pka activity.
none of the inhibitors prevented the reduction in [3h]nmha binding, ruling out the participation of pkc or
pka. thus, the precise mechanisms involved in receptor down-regulation remain unclear.
synapse doi 10.1002/syn

regarding the functional consequences of h3 receptor down-regulation, our data show that preincubation
with immepip prevented the inhibitory effect of a second exposure to the h3 agonist on  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated
[3h]-camp accumulation in striatal slices, indicating
that a signiﬁcant loss of function follows the reduction
in membranal receptors (von zastrow, 2003).
there is in the literature some evidence pointing out
to h3 receptor desensitization. perez-garcia et al.
(1998) showed that a second exposure (30-min interval)
to r-a-methyl-histamine resulted in a modest (14%)
reduction in the maximum effect but a signiﬁcant shift
in the pd2 estimate (from 7.74 6 0.11 to 6.92 6 0.18)
for the inhibition of electrically evoked twitches in
guinea-pig ileum stripes. by using a similar preparation, coruzzi et al. (1991) had already reported that
the inhibitory effects of histamine and h3 agonists
decreased in a second application, without recovery after 3 h. more recently, powell and hill (2003) reported
that in cho-k1 cells transfected with human histamine h3 receptors tagged with an enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein (egfp), internalization of the receptor
occurs very slowly reaching a maximum after 90 min of
stimulation. taken together these observations suggest
homologous desensitization of the h3 receptor. however, to the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst
report of rapid, homologous h3 receptor down-regulation occurring in brain tissues.
striatal h3 receptors are located both on afferent terminals and projection neurones (cumming et al., 1991;
molina-hernández et al., 2001; ryu et al., 1994), and
receptor down-regulation reported herein is likely to
involve both subpopulations as internalization has
been shown to occur in neuronal bodies and terminals
(faure et al., 1995; parton et al., 1992). however, for
 xxxg1618xxx  nt1 receptors the extent of internalization
differs signiﬁcantly between striatal synaptosomes and
cultured neurones (20 and 80%, respectively; mazella
et al., 1991; nguyen et al., 2002; vanisberg et al.,
1991). thus, h3 receptor down-regulation may predominantly take place in somato-dendritic regions.
interestingly, portacaval anastomosis increases histamine levels in rat brain and induces a modest
decrease in [3h]r-a-methylhistamine binding in the
striatum and some cortical areas, and postmortem
analysis in patients with hepatic encephalopathy
showed increased histamine contents and reduced h3
receptor levels in the caudate-putamen and cerebral
cortex (lozeva et al., 1998, 2003). it would be tempting
to assume these ﬁndings as evidence for h3 receptor
down-regulation, but long-term regulation of gene
expression cannot be ruled out.
in summary, herein we have provided evidence for
rapid, homologous down-regulation of histamine h3
receptors in rat striatum. this phenomenon should be
taken into account when considering therapeutic uses
for h3 agonists.
