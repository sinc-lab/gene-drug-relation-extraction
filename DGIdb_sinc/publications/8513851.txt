summary. six subjects with normal liver function
(group 1) and 7 patients with liver dysfunction (group 2;
m e a n icgr15 value 30.5 (5.2) %; range 16 to 56) received a
single oral dose of i mg  xxxd3305xxx , a prodrug-type a c e
inhibitor, with preferentially excreted by the biliary route.
the plasma  xxxd3305xxx  concentrations in g r o u p 2 at
30 rain and 1 h postdose were significantly higher than in
g r o u p 1, but the difference had disappeared 2 h postdosing. although the half life of  xxxd3305xxx  diacid in g r o u p 2
was significantly longer than in g r o u p 1, there was no significant difference between the two groups in a u c , c ....
or t .... in g r o u p 2, urinary recovery of  xxxd3305xxx  was significantly increased, suggesting a possible delay in the bioactivation of  xxxd3305xxx  into the diacid, but recovery of
the diacid itself was not abnormal. a c e inhibitory action
in g r o u p 2 remained unchanged.
 xxxd3305xxx  is regarded as an a c e inhibitor the disposition and efficacy of which are little affected in patients
with impaired liver function.

since the appearance of captopril in 1977, m a n y a c e inhibitors have been developed. they are valuable in the
treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure.
most of them in clinical use are excreted through the kidneys. in patients with renal failure, such drugs are likely to
show excessive action and to cause adverse effects as a result of an excessive elevation of the plasma drug concentration. consequently, their clinical use may be limited [1].
 xxxd3305xxx  hydrochloride (abbreviated to  xxxd3305xxx )
is a newly developed, long-acting a c e inhibitor without
an sh group in its structure. it is characterised by rapid
onset of action, resulting from fast metabolism to the active  xxxd2537xxx  (abbreviated as the diacid) and the
predominance of biliary excretion [2], and plasma concentrations in patients with renal failure are barely influenced
by the renal function [3, 4]

it is clinically important to investigate the pharmacokinetic disposition of  xxxd3305xxx  in patients with liver
dysfunction. the present study was p e r f o r m e d to compare
its disposition in patients with liver dysfunction with that
in subjects with normal liver function.

subjects and methods
patients
thirteen subjects took part in the study after giving their consent.
6 had normal liver and renal function (group 1) and 7 had liver
cirrhosis, as diagnosed by liver biopsy (group 2). the latter 7 patients were classified into grade a (4 patients) and grade b (3)
according to the pugh-child classification. the ages and body
weights were 45.5 (4.6), mean with (sem) y and 67.2 (4.7) kg in
group 1; 57.1 (3.3) y 57.4 (2.7) kg in group 2. all patients showed a
normal creatinine clearance and blood chemistry tests of renal function. to evaluate hepatic function, the indocyanine green retention
rate at 15 min (icgr15test: normal range < 10 %) was used. plasma
concentration of the dye was measured 15 min after a single iv injection of a dose based on body weight, and the rate at which the dye disappeared from plasma was determined [5]. the icgm5 mean value
in group 2 was 30.5 (5.2) % (range 16.4 - 55.8).

procedures
the protocol of the study was approved by the institutional review
board prior to initiation of the study. informed consent was obtained
from all subjects. each subject received i mg  xxxd3305xxx  orally after
breakfast. blood samples were collected before and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24,
and 48 h after administration. each sample was centrifuged within
30 min after blood sampling and was frozen at - 20 °c until analysed.
urine samples were collected for 0-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-24, and 24-48 h
after dosing. the volume of urine was recorded and 10 ml aliquots
were kept at - 20 °c for determination of drug concentration.

assays and statistical analysis
 xxxd3305xxx  and its diacid in blood and urine were determined by
gc/ms, as described in a previous report [6]. the detection limits
were 0.5 and 5 ng- ml- 1 for blood and urine, respectively. plasma
ace activity was determined by hplc [7].

postdose were 18.5 (5.1) and 6.0 (1.2) ng. ml - 1,respectively,
which were significantly higher than the corresponding
levels of 3.1 (1.1) and 1.9 (1.0) ng.ml 1 (p <0.05) in
group 1. the plasma concentration of the diacid in
group 2 was significantly higher than that in group 1 at
24 h (2.4 (0.2) vs, 1.1 (0.5) n g - m l - 1; p < 0.05), and 48 h (1.5
(0.1) vs, 0.2 (0.2) ng- ml -1; p < 0.05) after dosing.
none of the differences in other plasma concentrations
was statistically significant. the pharmacokinetic parameters of the diacid are given in table 1. cmax and tmax in
group i were not significantly different from the corresponding values in group 2, but tla in group 2 was significantly longer than in group 1 (p < 0.05). the a u c in
group 2 tended to be larger than in group 1, but the difference was not statistically significant. these parameters
were not related to the degree of liver dysfunction assessed by icgm5 determination.
the inhibition of a c e activity in group 2 was significantly greater than in group 1 at 30 min (40.1% vs.
66.4 % ; p < 0.05) and i h (22.7 % vs. 57.3 % ; p < 0.05)
after dosing, but thereafter there was no significant difference between the two groups (bottom of fig. 1).
the 48 h cumulative urinary recovery of  xxxd3305xxx

blood pressure tended to decrease and the heart rate
remained unchanged after dosing in both groups.

discussion

in subjets with normal liver function (group 1) and in patients with
liver dysfunction (group 2). mean + sem. o--o: group 1 (n = 6);
~----e: group 2 (n = 7)

 xxxd3305xxx  is known to be rapidly absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract and rapidly to be converted into the
diacid, which inhibits a c e in plasma [9]. since biliary excretion is the dominant route of elimination of  xxxd3305xxx 
from the body, and because it is a prodrug, the effect of
liver function on pharmacokinetic parameters required
study before the drug could be used clinically. in group 2,
the mean icgm5 was 30.5 (5.2) % (range 16.4-55.8),
indicating highly impaired liver function. in 6 patients
with borderline essential hypertension, blood pressure
measured in the sedentary position was significantly decreased after a single dose of 0.5, 1, or 2 mg  xxxd3305xxx  [2].

(top) and its diacid (middle) and inhibition of ace activity (bottom)

pharmacokinetic parameters for these two substances were calculated by model-independent moment analysis from their plasma
concentrations [8]. the auc (area under the plasma concentration
curve-time curve) was represented by the area from t = 0 to t = 48 h,
when the final blood sample was collected. the tla value was calculated by log-linear regression analysis of data obtained during the
elimination phase.
differences between group i and group 2 were examined by the
t test. mean values are given with (sd) in table 1 and (sem) in fig. 1.

385
consequently, a single dose of 1 mg  xxxd3305xxx  was used
in the present study.
in group 1, the plasma  xxxd3305xxx  concentration
began to decline soon after dosing, confirming its rapid
conversion into the diacid. in group 2, the plasma  xxxd3305xxx  concentrations 30 min and i h after dosing were significantly higher than in group 1. subsequently, the concentration fell rapidly, and no significant difference was
demonstrated between the groups from 2 h after dosing.
on the other hand, the diacid concentration in group 2
was significantly higher than in group 1 at 24 and 48 h
after dosing, suggesting that the bioactivation of  xxxd3305xxx  is delayed if liver function is impaired. the urinary recovery of  xxxd3305xxx  in group 2 was significantly greater
than in group 1, but no significant difference in urinary
excretion was observed for the diacid. in group 2, residual a c e activity was significantly decreased only soon
after administration or up to i h after dosing, and the decreased level recovered later. this indicates that the delay
and decrease in the conversion of  xxxd3305xxx  were not sufficiently severe to affect the therapeutic efficacy. fosinopril, another newly developed a c e inhibitor which is
eliminated by the biliary route, also showed blood levels
in patients with impaired renal function which were slightly higher than those in patients with normal renal function
[10]. when fosinopril was given to 6 patients on c a p d
[11], the plasma concentration rose markedly in one patient with liver dysfunction. that rise was attributed to a
delay in absorption or in hydrolysis to the diacid. in the
case of enalapril, a pharmacokinetic study in patients with
severe liver dysfunction with an average icgals value of
37.0 (3.2) % [12] showed that the urinary recovery of enalapril and its diacid were 47.2 (6.2) % and 12.7 (3.2) %, respectively; the corresponding values in subjects with normal liver function were 24.7 (2.3) % and 37.7 (3.8) %.
thus, in patients with liver dysfunction, the urinary recovery of enalapril was increased and that of its active metabolite was decreased, suggesting that bioactivation of
enalapril to enalaprilate was greatly impaired in liver dysfunction. the conversion of enalapril into its diacid is believed to be catalysed mainly by carboxyesterases in the
liver [13]. consequently, if liver function were impaired,
the conversion might also be affected. in contrast, the conversion of  xxxd3305xxx  by liver carboxyesterase is more
rapid than that of enalapril, and the conversion is also
catalysed by esterases widely distributed in other organs
(ikeda, unpublished observations). consequently, if liver
function is impaired, esterases outside the liver might suffice to compensate for the insufficiency and to maintain
the level of conversion.
the results indicate that the bioactivation of  xxxd3305xxx , a prodrug a c e inhibitor which is chiefly eliminated
through the biliary route, is little affected in patients with
liver dysfunction.
