abstract

 xxxd3495xxx  (avp) is a neuropeptide hormone that plays an important
role in circulatory and sodium homeostasis, and regulating serum osmolality.
several clinical conditions have been associated with inappropriately elevated
levels of avp including heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver and the syndrome of
inappropriate secretion of  xxxd3495xxx . three receptor subtypes that
mediate the actions of avp have been identified (v1a, v2 and v1b).
activation of v1a receptors located in vascular smooth muscle cells and the
myocardium results in vasoconstriction and increased afterload and hypertrophy.
the v2 receptors located primarily in the collecting tubules mediate free water
absorption. the v1b receptors are located in the anterior pituitary and mediate
 xxxg1801xxx  hormone release.
the cardiovascular and renal effects of avp are mediated primarily by v1a
and v2 receptors. antagonism of v1a receptors results in vasodilatation and
antagonism of v2 receptors resulting in aquaresis, an electrolyte-sparing water
excretion. several non-peptide avp antagonists (vasopressin receptor antagonists
[vras]) also termed ‘vaptans’ have been developed and are vigorously being
studied primarily for treating conditions characterised by hyponatraemia and fluid
overload.
 xxxd1747xxx  is a combined v1a/v2-receptor antagonist that induces diuresis as
well as haemodynamic improvement. it has been shown in clinical trials to correct
euvolaemic and hypervolaemic hyponatraemia, and has been approved by the us
fda for the treatment of euvolaemic hyponatraemia as an intravenous infusion.
 xxxd3399xxx , a selective v2-receptor antagonist, has undergone extensive clinical
studies in the treatment of hyponatraemia and heart failure. it has been shown to
effectively decrease fluid in volume overloaded patients with heart failure and to
correct hyponatraemia. a large outcome study (n = 4133 patients) will define its
role in the management of heart failure. lixivaptan and satavaptan (sr-121463)
are other selective v2-receptor antagonists being evaluated for the treatment of
hyponatraemia.
in addition, a potential role for the vaptans in attenuating polyuria in
 xxxg231xxx  and cyst development in polycystic kidney disease
is being explored.
ongoing clinical trials should further define the scope of the potential therapeutic role of vras.

several clinical conditions are associated with
abnormal water retention mediated by  xxxd3495xxx  (avp) release including heart failure, cirrhosis and the syndrome of inappropriate  xxxd3495xxx  secretion (siadh). a possible therapy
targeting the avp receptors in these disorders has
been the subject of increasing interest.
this article reviews the current understanding of
the role of vasopressin in these clinical conditions
and the various types and functions of vasopressin
receptors known to exist. the article then focuses on
current vasopressin receptor antagonists (vras) also termed ‘vaptans’ and their potential therapeutic
role.

mus, and stored in the posterior pituitary.[1] it is also
synthesised in peripheral tissues, including the
heart, where it may act as a paracrine hormone.[2,3]
normally, small changes in plasma osmolality, as
little as 1%, influence the release of avp by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, resulting in fine
control of serum sodium levels and serum osmolality.[1] a decrease in blood volume also stimulates
avp release via baroreceptors, located in the carotid
artery, aortic arch and left atrium, which sense
changes in intra-arterial plasma volume.[1] in pathological states, including heart failure, non-osmotic
mechanisms activated primarily by baroreceptors
and including  xxxg99xxx  seem to play a greater
role in the control of avp release[4] (figure 1).

superfamily.[5] they are identified by their second
messenger systems, locations and effects (table i).
2.1 v1a (or v1) receptors

the v1a receptors are located on vascular
smooth muscle cells, in the myocardium, hepatocytes and platelets, and when activated by avp or
agonists they mediate vasoconstriction in the coronary and peripheral circulation as well as
glycogenolysis and platelet aggregation.[5] increased
intracellular calcium levels in cardiac myocytes and
increased rate of protein synthesis have also been
reported.[6,7] it is believed that myocyte hypertrophy
is a direct result of these effects. in vivo, vasoconstriction is mitigated by decreased activity of the
sympathetic nervous system as a result of central
activation of the baroreflex system.[8] the receptors
are linked to a phosphoinositol signalling pathway
with intracellular calcium acting as a second messenger.
2.2 v2 receptors

the v2 receptors are found predominantly in the
collecting tubules of the kidney and mediate free
water absorption by mobilising intracellular vesicles
of aquaporin-2 to the apical plasma membrane of the
collecting duct cells causing an increase in water
permeability and an antidiuretic effect.[9] v2 receptors are linked to an adenylate cyclase signalling
pathway with intracellular cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (camp) as a second messenger.[5,9]
© 2007 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

however, v2-mediated renal effects can be opposed by  xxxg229xxx -mediated generation of  xxxd1903xxx  in the medullary interstitial cells, which
explains the antidiuretic effect of nsaids.[5,10] extrarenal v2 receptors have also been implicated in
 xxxg2423xxx  secretion.[11]
2.3 v1b (or v3) receptors

these receptors are found in the anterior pituitary
and mediate  xxxg1801xxx  release.[12] they have also been identified in peripheral tissues but their physiological role is yet to be
determined.[12] the v1b receptors, like the v1a receptors, use a phosphoinositol signalling pathway
with intracellular calcium as a second messenger.[12]
3. role of vasopressin in disease states
circulating levels of avp have been found to be
inappropriately elevated in several conditions including heart failure, siadh, cirrhosis of the liver,
polycystic kidney disease, nephrotic syndrome, surgical stress and some forms of hypertension.[1] it has
been hypothesised that chronically elevated levels
of avp in heart failure might be involved in the
pathophysiology as well as the progression of the
disease state.[13,14] higher levels are found in patients with more advanced disease and hyponatraemia.[14,15]
3.1 hyponatraemia

hyponatraemia is the most common electrolyte
abnormality in hospitalised patients with a prevadrugs 2007; 67 (6)

lence of 1–45% depending on the clincal setting,
patient population and the serum value used to define it.[16-18] it is an established risk factor for increasing morbidity and mortality in patients with
heart failure.[18,19] with the exception of renal failure, disorders that are associated with impaired renal
water excretion are characterised by elevated avp
levels.[16] the most common cause for euvolaemic
hyponatraemia is siadh,[20] and for hypervolaemic
hyponatraemia are heart failure[15] and cirrhosis.[21]
current therapy for hyponatraemia include fluid
restriction to <1 l/day, judicious infusion of hypertonic saline, diuretics, urea and demeclocycline.
these measures are limited by low adherence, safety
concerns and adverse effects.
 xxxd1747xxx , a v1a/v2 vra, was approved by
the us fda in december 2005 and is the only
fda-approved vaptan for the treatment of euvolaemic hyponatraemia.
3.2 heart failure

heart failure is commonly associated with
hypervolaemic hyponatraemia. hyponatraemia in
heart failure correlates with both the severity and
prognosis of the disease.[18,19] hyponatraemia is
multifactorial in heart failure, but is thought to be
caused primarily by a low cardiac output state leading to a drop in renal blood flow and glomerular
filtration rate, which reduces the rate of solute and
water delivery to the distal diluting segment of the
nephron. the low-output state causes the baroreflex
system to sense a false volume-depleted state, resulting in release of avp, activation of the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (raas).[22]
binding of avp to v2 receptors in the collecting
tubules results in stimulation of aquaporin-2 with
subsequent increased free water reabsorption and
decreased plasma osmolality.[8] the attempts of the
osmotic receptors to suppress a rise in vasopressin
levels is overridden by the baroreflex system and the
cycle of worsening volume overload and hyponatraemia persists.[23] moreover, activation of avp
v1a receptors promotes vasoconstriction, increases

afterload and potentially stimulates cardiac hypertrophy.[5,6]
in patients with heart failure, elevated avp has
been associated with increased mortality.[13,14] progression of heart failure leading to signs and symptoms of congestion and worsening hyponatraemia
seem to be related in part to neurohormonal activation and increased levels of renin, angiotensin, aldosterone, catecholamines and avp. large-scale
clinical trials have shown reduction in mortality
therapy with beta-adrenergic antagonists (beta-blockers),
ace inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists
(angiotensin receptor blockers; arbs) and aldosterone antagonists.
conventional therapy with loop diuretics and fluid restriction, however, has a limited effect on improving hyponatraemia. in addition, diuretics have
undesirable side effects, including electrolyte depletion, and have been implicated in increasing mortality rate.[24-26] however, it should be kept in mind that
because these analyses are retrospective, the worsened prognosis of heart failure patients taking diuretics could simply reflect selection bias of sicker
patients.
nevertheless, the potential increased mortality
risk with diuretics coupled with the dilemma of
correcting hyponatraemia in volume-overloaded patients stimulated exploration of a potential therapeutic role of vaptans in the pharmacological treatment
of heart failure.
blocking v2 receptors is what is needed in order
to induce diuresis with the advantage of not inducing kaliuresis. on theoretical grounds, combined
blockade of v1a/v2 receptors may offer the advantage of inducing systemic vasodilation combined
with removal of excess fluid. furthermore, blockade
of the v1a receptors may prevent myocardial hypertrophy and remodelling based on in vitro studies[6-8]
with no confirmation from in vivo studies to date.
3.3 cirrhosis of the liver

cirrhosis, like heart failure, is characterised by
hypervolaemic hyponatraemia, impaired delivery of
solute to the diluting sites, impaired overall water
excretion capacity and persistent inappropriate avp
drugs 2007; 67 (6)

vasopressin receptor antagonists

release by non-osmotic mechanisms. the similarity
has brought attention to the role of avp and potential therapeutic efficacy for avp receptor blockade.
however, the v1a receptors in the setting of portal
hypertension mediate avp pressor effects, which
when blocked may produce splanchnic vasodilatation that could promote variceal bleeding.[27] therefore, at this time, only  xxxg231xxx  antagonists are
being explored in cirrhotic hyponatraemia.
3.4 syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic
hormone secretion

siadh is characterised by inappropriately high
avp level despite hypotonicity.[28] euvolaemic
hyponatraemia ensues. therapy in the past has
targeted avp secretion by agents such as ethanol,
opiates and phenytoin ( xxxd2924xxx ), but with
limited and unpredictable response. decreasing the
effects of avp at target tissues is another approach
that has had limited and often adverse effects.[5]
compensating for the effects produced by the excess
hormone secretion, such as restricted fluid intake or
hypertonic saline have been uncomfortable, difficult
to adhere to, and often ineffective.[5] as stated in
section 3.1,  xxxd1747xxx  was the first vaptan approved by the fda for the treatment of euvolaemic
hyponatraemia.
3.5  xxxg231xxx 

 xxxg231xxx  may result from
mutations to the  xxxg231xxx  2 gene ( xxxg231xxx ) or
aquaporin-2 (aqp2). there are three types of v2
receptor mutations:[29] (i) type 1 mutations prevent
avp binding; (ii) type 2 mutations interfere with
transport of the receptor from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell membrane; and (iii) type 3 mutations involve unstable messenger rna transcription. interestingly, patients with congenital type 2
mutations in  xxxg231xxx  who
were given relcovaptan had significantly increased
urine osmolality.[30] these results suggest that v1a
and v2 vras may improve transport of the receptor.[29,30] the future role of avp antagonists in
 xxxg231xxx  may be promising in
certain types but needs further study.

3.6 hypertension

evolution may have implemented avp as a part
of the body’s response to trauma or blood loss.
increased serum avp levels in hypotensive states
contributes to peripheral vasoconstriction, retention
of water by kidneys, restoration of blood pressure
and overall haemodynamic stabilisation.[31] in fact,
vasopressin has been successfully tested for resuscitation and is recommended as an alternative to epinephrine (adrenaline) in current advanced cardiac
life support guidelines.[32,33]
while hypotension may increase avp levels,
measurement of plasma avp in essential hypertension has not provided consistent results, with the
exception of lack of correlation between blood pressure and avp levels.[34] however, avp appears to
play an important role only after sympathetic inhibition.[34,35] in salt-dependent forms of experimental
hypertension, elevated avp levels appear to have a
mediator role in the pathophysiology of at least the
initiation of elevated blood pressure.[34] for example, studies with mineralcorticoid-induced hypertension in rats indicate that avp plays a significant
pathophysiological role.[36]
ethnicity has been suggested to influence the role
of avp in hypertension. in elderly hypertensive
patients, increased avp level has been noted in
african americans compared with an age-matched
hypertensive caucasian group.[37] in one study of 39
hypertensive patients, treatment with a v1a antagonist lowered blood pressure in african americans
but not caucasians before and after treatment with
clonidine.[38]
it is proposed that antagonism of both v1a and
v2 receptors may play a role in the treatment of
hypertension by a combination of lowering vascular
resistance and circulating volume, but there is still
much investigation left in this area.
3.7 polycystic kidney disease

in this disorder, camp-dependent genes increase
cell proliferation and promote fluid-filled renal
cysts.[39] as mentioned previously, the  xxxg231xxx 
uses camp as a second messenger. studies in
animal models have led to the theory that a v2 vra
drugs 2007; 67 (6)

852

ali et al.

may reduce camp levels, thus interfering with the
genes responsible for promoting polycystic kidney
disease.[40]
4. vasopressin receptor
antagonists (vras)
avp receptor antagonists were first developed as
peptide antagonists in the 1960s. although these
peptides mediated antagonism to both antidiuretic
and pressor responses in animals, a paradoxical
weak agonism to the  xxxg231xxx  was seen in human
studies.[5] this was believed to be due to species
differentiation of prostaglandins in the kidney. also
disappointing was the fact that these compounds had
poor oral bioavailability and short biological halflives.[5]
employing a functional screening strategy, the
first non-peptide v2 antagonist was characterised in
1992 in japan by yamamura et al.[41] these nonpeptide vras appeared to be more bioavailable
with longer half lives than the earlier peptide formulations. several non-peptide vras have been studied in human clinical trials. these vaptans include
 xxxd1747xxx ,  xxxd3399xxx , lixivaptan, relcovaptan
(sr-49059) and satavaptan (sr-121463), which
were developed as oral or intravenous formulations
and were all derived from benzazepine or oxindole
derivatives (table ii). they differ in their relative
selectivity for the various avp receptor subtypes
(table iii).
4.1 v1a vra

acute  xxxg229xxx  antagonism has been shown
to be synergistically beneficial when combined with
 xxxg99xxx  antagonism in improving myocyte
function and cardiac load in a pacing-induced heart

failure model.[43] interestingly, v1a vras have
been shown to be more potent in models with absent
raas and adrenergic systems.[44-46]
preliminary work with relcovaptan (sr-49059)
suggested that it might be haemodynamically beneficial in heart failure patients with elevated plasma
avp levels and hypertensive patients with low plasma avp levels.[35,47] this has led to the postulation
that avp plasma levels may not predict haemodynamic effects. limited data are available in longterm administration of v1a-receptor antagonists.
the expected haemodynamic effects of chronic
v1a-receptor antagonism such as arterial vasodilation, decreased afterload, and possibly reduction of
direct myocyte stimulation and hypertrophy have
shown promise in animal models but, disappointingly, v1a-receptor antagonists turned out as partial
agonists in human models.[48]
4.2 v2 vra

the v2 vras have had more promising results
than the v1a vras. blocking v2 receptors in the
distal collecting tubule of the kidney causes an
aquaresis, which is an electrolyte-sparing water excretion, which is different from diuresis. in experimental studies, there also appears to be less activation of the raas and adrenergic sympathetic system when compared with furosemide.[49]
4.2.1  xxxd3399xxx 

 xxxd3399xxx  is an oral, selective v2 vra that has
shown to be a potent aquaretic in both animal and
human studies. in a double-blind, placebo controlled
trial, 254 patients with systolic heart failure were
randomised to  xxxd3399xxx  30, 45, 60mg or placebo for
25 days.[50] the primary endpoint was change in
bodyweight from baseline. patients were maintained

and were taken off baseline diuretics for 2 days at
which time they were randomised to placebo,
monotherapy with  xxxd3399xxx  30mg, furosemide
80mg or both once daily. at 1 week,  xxxd3399xxx 
monotherapy reduced bodyweight and oedema compared with placebo without significant changes in
electrolytes. compared with furosemide, an increase
in urine output but no change in bodyweight was
noted with both  xxxd3399xxx  and  xxxd3399xxx  plus
furosemide.[52]
the meteor (multicenter evaluation of
 xxxd3399xxx  effect on remodeling) study assessed
the effects of  xxxd3399xxx  on left ventricular size and
function. a total of 240 patients with symptomatic
heart failure (nyha ii and iii), left ventricular
ejection fraction <30% were randomised to
 xxxd3399xxx  30 mg/day or placebo. after 1 year of
therapy, there were no differences in left ventricular
volume or ejection fraction.[53]
the ongoing double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial, everest (efficacy of vasopressin antagonism in heart failure: outcome study with
 xxxd3399xxx ), is expected to reveal much anticipated
information on mortality, morbidity and patientassessed global clinical status in  xxxd3399xxx -treated
patients compared with standard care.[54]
4.2.2 lixivaptan

lixivaptan is an orally active selective v2 vra
that has shown potent aquaresis in animals and
humans.[55] in a recently published double-blind,
placebo-controlled, single-dose study, 42 patients
with heart failure were randomised to lixivaptan 10,
30, 75, 150, 250 or 400mg after overnight fluid
deprivation.[56] lixivaptan produced significant
dose-related increase in urine volume and solutefree water excretion at all doses except the 10mg
dose. higher serum osmolality and serum sodium
levels were noted at the 75mg or higher and the
150mg or higher doses, respectively. the drug was
well tolerated.
in a randomised, placebo-controlled study, 44
hospitalised patients with stable hyponatraemia
mostly from cirrhosis were randomised for 7 days to
lixivaptan 25, 125, 250mg or placebo twice daily. a
© 2007 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

significant improvement in aquaresis (p < 0.05) was
noted in the two highest doses without significant
alteration in haemodynamics, electrolytes or renal
function.[57] there was significant increase in serum
sodium levels and osmolality. fifty percent of patients taking the 250mg dose (n = 5) had the dose
held several times because of significant dehydration as determined by thirst score, and marked increases in serum sodium levels. by day 7, there were
marked increases in avp levels in the two highest
dose lixivaptan groups, which may have accounted
for the plateauing of the aquaretic effect with repeated administration.[57]
in another double-blind, placebo-controlled
study, 60 patients with hyponatraemia and cirrhosis
were randomised to lixivaptan 100 or 200mg or
placebo for 7 days or until serum sodium levels
increased to >136 mmol/l.[58] patients were fluid
restricted to 1 l/day. serum sodium levels normalised in 0%, 27% and 50% in the placebo, 100mg
(p < 0.05) and 200mg (p < 0.0001) groups, respectively. significant reduction in urine osmolality and
bodyweight were also seen in the treated group. a
marked increase in thirst was seen in the 200mg
group but not the 100mg group. serious adverse
effects like renal insufficiency were seen equally in
all three groups.[58]
although promising, more studies are needed to
assess the future of lixivaptan in clinical practice.
4.2.3 satavaptan

satavaptan is an orally active selective v2 vra
that has been shown in a randomised, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study in 37 patients with
hyponatraemia due to siadh to be effective in the
treatment of hyponatraemia.[59] two dosages of
satavaptan were evaluated, 25 and 50mg. normalisation of serum sodium levels or an increase by
≥5 meq/l were noted in 13% of patients receiving
placebo compared with 79% of patients receiving
satavaptan 25mg (p = 0.006) and 83% of patients
receiving satavaptan 50mg (p = 0.005). no significant serious adverse events were noted.
although the published experience with
satavaptan is limited, the preliminary results are
encouraging.

4.3 v1a/v2 vra
4.3.1  xxxd1747xxx 

 xxxd1747xxx  is a non-peptide v1a/v2 vra that
has been shown in animal studies to induce significant aquaresis, marked haemodynamic improvements and reduced myocyte protein synthesis.[60-62]
 xxxd1747xxx  is the only fda approved vaptan at
this time for use in euvolaemic hyponatraemic patients as an intravenous infusion. development of
the oral formulation was discontinued because of
potent inhibition of the cyp3a4 isoenzyme in the
liver and small intestine, and significant drug-drug
interactions.
in an intravenous randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, 66 patients with euvolaemic or hypervolaemic hyponatraemia (serum sodium levels between 115–130 meq/l)[63] following
24-hour baseline placebo infusion received an intra-

venous loading dose of  xxxd1747xxx  20mg or placebo,
followed by continuous infusion of  xxxd1747xxx  40,
80mg or placebo for 4 days. a significant increase in
serum sodium levels (the primary endpoint) was
seen with  xxxd1747xxx  40 and 80 mg/day.[63]
in a 5-day placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blind study involving 74 in-patients with
hyponatraemia, oral  xxxd1747xxx  40 and 20 mg/day
was well tolerated and efficacious in correcting serum sodium levels[64] (figure 3).
while the fda approved use is currently for
euvolaemic hyponatraemia, the theoretical benefit
of aquaresis from v2-receptor antagonism in addition to the beneficial haemodynamic changes due to
the  xxxg229xxx  antagonism make this antagonist
attractive for conditions characterised by hypervolaemic hyponatraemia such as heart failure.

tagonist in chf patients undergoing exercise), evaluated the effect of 12-week administration of
 xxxd1747xxx  (10, 20 or 40mg daily) on symptoms and
functional capacity in 343 patients with heart failure.[65] there were no statistically significant differences between the treated and placebo groups in
exercise duration or symptoms.[65]
in a haemodynamic, double-blind study, 142 patients nyha class iii–iv were randomised to a
single intravenous dose of  xxxd1747xxx  (10, 20 or
40mg) or placebo.[66] in the higher dose  xxxd1747xxx 
groups, pulmonary capillary wedge and right atrial
pressures were significantly reduced compared with
placebo at 3 and 6 hours after administration. there
was also a significant dose-dependent increase in
urine output during the first 4 hours after administration. no differences in cardiac index, systemic or
pulmonary vascular resistance, blood pressure or
heart rate were noted, leading to the postulation that
the haemodynamic changes were related more to the
volume loss secondary to the v2-receptor antagonism.[66]
in a combined analysis of three trials, one with
intravenous and two with oral administration,
 xxxd1747xxx  40 and 80 mg/day significantly increased serum sodium levels in hyponatraemic patients with (n = 94) and without (n = 147) heart
failure.[67]
however, it should be emphasised that initial
fda approval for  xxxd1747xxx  was restricted to the
intravenous formulation of  xxxd1747xxx  for the treatment of euvolaemic hyponatraemia.
5. conclusions
recognition of the important role that avp plays
in circulatory and sodium homeostasis has led to
identification of several receptor subtypes that mediate its actions and the development of non-peptide
antagonists to these receptors. antagonism of v1a
receptors located in vascular smooth muscle cells
results in vasodilation and antagonism of v2 receptors located in the renal collecting duct results in
aquaresis. extensive clinical testing is underway to
define the therapeutic potential of vras.
 xxxd1747xxx , a combined v1a/v2-receptor antago© 2007 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

nist, has been approved for the intravenous treatment of euvolaemic hyponatraemia.  xxxd3399xxx , a
selective v2-receptor antagonist, is being evaluated
for the treatment of hyponatraemia and heart failure,
including its effect on heart failure morbidity, mortality and quality of life.
a very promising therapeutic potential of vras
in addition to hyponatraemia includes conditions
characterised by fluid overload, such as heart failure
and cirrhosis. furthermore, attenuating polyuria in
 xxxg231xxx  and cyst development in polycystic kidney disease are exciting areas
for potential future use for these agents.
clinical experience and future clinical trials
should continue to define the scope and proper therapeutic role of the various vras.
