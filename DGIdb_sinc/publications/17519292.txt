rized as normal-transit constipation, slow-transit constipation,
and disorders of defecatory or rectal evacuation. if there are
specific recognizable causes of a patient’s constipation, it is
considered secondary. multiple factors, such as medications,
pregnancy, mechanical obstruction, diet, neurologic disorders,
metabolic and endocrine disorders, and central nervous system disorders, can be identified as potential causes.10,11
the cornerstone of nonpharmacologic management of
constipation has been the implementation of lifestyle
changes. these include increased fiber and fluid intake and
the introduction of regular nonstrenuous exercise. this approach has been recommended as first-line therapy by
many physicians; however, there is insufficient evidence to
support the benefits of these modalities in the treatment of
constipation.12 the next step in the constipation algorithm
is the use of nonprescription laxatives, which can include
bulk laxatives, stool softeners, and/or osmotic laxatives
(table 2).13 stimulant laxatives, while available over-thecounter, are not recommended for chronic constipation.
for patients in whom more vigilant therapy may be needed, prescription medications are warranted.
in recent years, new therapeutic medications have been
approved for chronic constipation.  xxxd3302xxx , a partial
serotonin agonist, was approved for treatment of chronic
constipation in men and women younger than 65 years of
age.14 although this drug has been shown to improve bowel movements, a cochrane review demonstrated that abdominal pain and discomfort were not considerably improved.15 this medication was withdrawn from the market
in april 2007 due to increased cardiovascular events.16
in january 2006, the food and drug administration
(fda) approved  xxxd2513xxx  ( xxxd2513xxx ) for the treatment
of chronic idiopathic constipation in adults. we discuss the
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of
 xxxd2513xxx  in this population.
data sources and selection
a pubmed/medline search was conducted (1966 –
january 2007) using the key words  xxxd2513xxx ,  xxxd2513xxx ,

and chronic constipation. other scholarly search databases
included ingentaconnect and international pharmaceutical
abstracts. data provided from the manufacturer and the
fda were also reviewed. a bibliography review was also
done on the references identified in the primary search.
pharmacology
 xxxd2513xxx  is supplied as an oval, orange, 24 µg soft
gelatin capsule. the fda-approved dose is 24 µg, given
orally twice daily.
 xxxd2513xxx  is a member of a new class of bicyclic fatty acid  xxxd124xxx  derivatives known as prostones.
unlike prostaglandins, prostones do not have a significant
effect on  xxxd1903xxx  or f receptors, nor do they have
any pharmacologic effect on smooth muscle contractions.
 xxxd2513xxx  is a highly selective activator of type 2 chloride channels (c1c-2) in the apical membrane of the gastrointestinal epithelium, increasing secretion of chloriderich enteric fluid without affecting serum chloride, sodium,
and potassium levels.17-19 this increase in intestinal fluid,
which appears to be dose dependent, results in improved
intestinal motility, increasing the passage of stool and alleviation of chronic constipation.18
the effect on gastric function and whole gut transit was
evaluated in 30 healthy volunteers.20 this randomized,
double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study
measured gastrointestinal and colonic transit via scintigraph and gastric volume via single photon emission computed tomography imaging and satiation test (using the nutrient drink ensure).  xxxd2513xxx  slowed gastric emptying
compared with placebo (132 vs 106 min; p = 0.003) but increased small bowel and colonic transit time, which was illustrated by geometric center measurements 24 hours after
ingestion of a radiolabeled meal (p = 0.017 and 0.033, respectively). small bowel transit time was approximately
90 minutes for the  xxxd2513xxx  group compared with approximately 130 minutes for the placebo group. additionally, the maximum tolerated gastric volume did not significantly change compared with baseline.

we found no published pharmacokinetic data on  xxxd2513xxx  in humans. hence, most of the information was retrieved from the manufacturer’s prescribing information.21
oral administration of  xxxd2513xxx  results in minimal
systemic availability and undetectable plasma concentrations (<10 pg/ml).21 therefore, area under the curve
(auc), maximum concentration, and half-life cannot be
fully determined. m3, the only measurable active metabolite of  xxxd2513xxx , achieves its peak plasma concentration
(41.9 pg/ml) approximately 1.14 hours after administration of the drug. the auc was shown to be 59.1 pg/ml

and increased dose proportionally after single doses of 24
µg and 144 µg.
 xxxd2513xxx  is approximately 95% bound to human
plasma proteins and is rapidly and extensively metabolized
to m3 via carbonyl reductase within the stomach and jejunum. the metabolism is not mediated by the cytochrome
p450 system. sixty percent of  xxxd2513xxx  was found in
the urine within 24 hours and 30% in feces within 168
hours.21 when radioactive  xxxd2513xxx  was administered
to animals, the majority of radiolabel was detected locally
in the gastrointestinal tract and, by 48 hours, 73–95% of
administered  xxxd2513xxx  was excreted, with the predominant route being urinary.22
when administered with a high-fat meal, the  xxxd2513xxx  auc0-∞ was unchanged, while the maximum concentration decreased by 55%. the manufacturer states that the
effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of this drug is still
unclear. however,  xxxd2513xxx  was given with food during clinical trials.21
no significant drug interactions have been reported to
date. since  xxxd2513xxx  is not metabolized by the cytochrome p450 system, it seems unlikely for enzyme inhibiting or inducing drugs to alter its pharmacokinetics. in addi-

tion,  xxxd2513xxx  does not appear to inhibit or induce this microsomal system. it also seems improbable, with the data
published, that any protein-binding mediated drug interactions occur. there appears to be no difference between sexes
in the pharmacokinetic profile of m3.  xxxd2513xxx  has not
been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.21
clinical studies
chronic constipation

available clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of  xxxd2513xxx  consist mainly of abstract data presented by johanson et al.23-27 (table 3). in an early phase ii
trial, safety and tolerability of  xxxd2513xxx  were evaluated
using various dosage regimens.23 two randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase iii trials evaluated the efficacy of  xxxd2513xxx  in the treatment of chronic constipation.24,25 other phase iii trials included an open-label trial26 and a randomized withdrawal study.27 inclusion criteria
were consistent among the trials, requiring constipation characteristics to be similar to rome ii diagnostic criteria for
chronic constipation. generally, chronic constipation was de-

 xxxd2513xxx  for chronic constipation

fined as having 3 or fewer spontaneous bowel movements
(sbms) each week for 6 months, along with very hard stools,
a sensation of incomplete emptying, or straining during at
least 25% of bowel movements for at least 6 months.
 xxxd2513xxx  was evaluated for dose-dependent safety
and efficacy in a phase ii study.23 subjects received  xxxd2513xxx  for 3 weeks following a 2 week drug-free period. patients were asked to record constipation variables in
a diary. during weeks 1 and 2, there was a statistically significant increase in the average weekly number of sbms
with the 48 and 72 µg groups compared with those receiving a placebo. additionally, these patients experienced an
sbm on the first day of treatment.
in 2 phase iii efficacy trials, 479 patients with chronic
constipation were randomized to  xxxd2513xxx  or placebo
following a 2 week drug-free period.24,25 both treatment
and placebo groups were comparable in the 2 studies. the
primary endpoint of both trials was sbm frequency. patients were evaluated at baseline and then weekly.
in the more recent trial, weekly sbms significantly increased from baseline in the  xxxd2513xxx  group versus the
placebo group within the first week (p < 0.0001).25 statistical significance continued to increase during weeks 2– 4.
additionally, 72% of patients in the  xxxd2513xxx  group
were considered full responders at week 1, with 61% having recorded an sbm within 24 hours. in the second trial,
a statistically significant weekly increase in the frequency
of sbms at all weeks of treatment was also demonstrated
in the  xxxd2513xxx  group compared with the placebo
group (p < 0.002 at all weeks).24 in both trials, more patients receiving  xxxd2513xxx  had an sbm within 24 hours
of the first dose compared with those receiving placebo (p
= 0.002424 and p ≤ 0.000125). in addition, significant improvement with  xxxd2513xxx  versus placebo was noted in
stool consistency (p < 0.00124 and p < 0.0001),25 straining
(p < 0.00124 and p < 0.00225), and constipation severity (p
< 0.0325). it was not mentioned how these parameters were
measured. no serious adverse events were reported.
a randomized withdrawal study was conducted in
which 128 constipated patients, after a 2 week drug-free
period, were administered  xxxd2513xxx  for 4 weeks.27 after this treatment period, the patients were assigned to either continue receiving  xxxd2513xxx  or placebo for an additional 3 weeks. patients were asked to record bowel activity and constipation symptoms in a daily diary. during
the 4 week treatment with  xxxd2513xxx , there was a statistically significant increase in bowel movements versus
baseline (1.36 vs 5.52– 6.25; p < 0.0001) as well as in all
other assessments (p < 0.0001). during the withdrawal period, at week 7, the  xxxd2513xxx  patients continued to have
a sustained response, reporting an average of 5.59 sbms
compared with 3.04 sbms for the placebo group (p =
0.0464), which still improved from baseline (p = 0.0020).
the relapse rate during the withdrawal period was signifiwww.theannals.com

cantly greater in the placebo group compared with the  xxxd2513xxx  group (p = 0.022). when examining all other
assessments during the withdrawal period, the authors noted that both groups improved from baseline; however, the
 xxxd2513xxx  group demonstrated a better response than did
the placebo group. specific information as to what was
meant by better response was not mentioned. this study
demonstrated no evidence of a rebound effect following
discontinuation of  xxxd2513xxx , nor did constipation severity revert to worse than baseline.
johanson et al.26 conducted a study examining data from
306 patients with chronic idiopathic constipation. after a
14 day washout period, symptomatic patients received  xxxd2513xxx  with food for 24 weeks on an as-needed basis.
evaluations were performed at weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 18, and
24 and at follow-up. efficacy parameters for this trial were
derived from patients’ diaries. safety considerations for
this trial consisted of incidence and frequency of adverse
events, laboratory measurements, and physical examinations. constipation severity, bloating, and abdominal discomfort improved significantly from baseline (p < 0.001).
from week 4 to 24, patient ratings of treatment effectiveness significantly increased (p = 0.01).
johanson et al.29 further described results from 3 openlabel, long-term trials in which patients’ efficacy assessments were evaluated approximately every 6 weeks over
6 –12 months. a total of 880 patients (study 1, n = 308;
study 2, n = 248; study 3, n = 324) were evaluated. subjects assessed their treatment effectiveness, constipation
severity, bloating, and discomfort using a 5 point scale.
descriptions of scale measurements were not defined in
the article. overall, significant (p < 0.0001) improvements
were seen in constipation severity, abdominal bloating, and
abdominal discomfort in all studies and at all visits. constipation severity improved throughout trial duration in all
3 studies. the final on-drug measurement showed a point increase of 1.15 in 866 patients. improvement continued in
studies 2 and 3, with an average increase of 1.38 points from
baseline to 48 weeks in 281 patients. abdominal bloating
and discomfort yielded similar results, with a last on-drug
measurement increase of 0.79 and 0.72 points, respectively,
in 867 patients. at 48 weeks, abdominal bloating and discomfort continued to improve, with a 1 point and a 0.87
point increase, respectively, in 282 patients. the authors concluded that  xxxd2513xxx  provides significant long-term relief
for many of the symptoms associated with constipation.
ueno et al.30,31 discussed pooled data from various studies evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of  xxxd2513xxx  in the elderly population (aged ≥65 y). the first report
discussed data from 3 short-term placebo-controlled clinical trials comparing the efficacy and safety of  xxxd2513xxx 
in elderly and nonelderly patients.31 the combined elderly
subgroup consisted of 31 placebo subjects and 26  xxxd2513xxx  48 µg/day subjects. efficacy was determined by sbm

frequency rates, stool consistency ratings, and bowel straining assessments. ratings and assessments were not defined.
during weeks 1, 3, and 4, among the elderly patients receiving  xxxd2513xxx , there was significant improvement in sbm
frequency rates (p ≤ 0.0286) compared with those receiving
placebo. improvements ranged from 4.6 to 5.4 additional
sbms per week from baseline for the  xxxd2513xxx  elderly
group compared with 1.29–2.27 sbms per week for elderly
subjects receiving placebo throughout the study period. stool
consistency and bowel straining rates produced similar results, although specific data were not reported. fewer adverse
effects were reported by elderly patients in the  xxxd2513xxx 
group compared with those in the placebo group (46.2% vs
61.3%, respectively). the authors concluded that  xxxd2513xxx  is an efficacious and well-tolerated agent for the treatment of chronic constipation in the elderly population.
further data were collected from 3 other clinical openlabel trials comparing long-term safety and efficacy in elderly and nonelderly patients.30 definition of elderly was
the same as in the previous analysis. pooled data yielded
163 subjects older than 65 years and 715 nonelderly subjects (aged 18–64 y). safety was assessed by the incidence
of adverse events and efficacy was determined by improvements in constipation severity, abdominal bloating,
and discomfort, using a 5 point severity scale (0 = no
symptoms, 4 = very severe). although fewer elderly patients reported adverse events than did nonelderly subjects,
the incidence was still high (121/163, 74.2% vs 573/715,
80.1%, respectively). nausea, the most prominent adverse
event, occurred in 17.8% of elderly subjects versus 29.4%
of nonelderly subjects. efficacy measures were the same
as those reported by johansen et al.29
constipation-predominant irritable bowel
syndrome

 xxxd2513xxx  is being evaluated to determine its safety
and efficacy in patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (c-ibs). in a 12 week, dose-ranging,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study, approximately 200
patients with c-ibs, as defined by the rome ii criteria,
were randomized to receive either placebo or  xxxd2513xxx 
16, 32, or 48 µg daily.32 data relating to dosing, abdominal
symptoms, bowel movements, and rescue medication use
were recorded and evaluated. during months 1 and 2, improvement rates were more than doubled in all categories
for the  xxxd2513xxx  groups compared with the placebo
group; however, actual numbers were not provided. overall, subjects in the 48 µg group displayed the greatest improvement; however, they also displayed the greatest incidence of adverse events. types of adverse events were not
stated. improvement in global ibs symptoms was not
evaluated. the authors concluded that  xxxd2513xxx  is safe
and efficacious for the treatment of c-ibs. based on the

limited data provided, we are not able to generate a true assessment on the role of  xxxd2513xxx  in c-ibs.
recently, a subanalysis of two 4 week phase iii chronic
constipation trials was completed, evaluating the efficacy
of  xxxd2513xxx  in 91 c-ibs patients (n = 46 receiving  xxxd2513xxx  24 µg bid and n = 45 receiving placebo).33 patients treated with  xxxd2513xxx  displayed a statistically significant increase in mean sbm compared with those taking placebo (p ≤ 0.0207) during all 4 weeks of treatment.
significant improvements in abdominal bloating and discomfort (p ≤ 0.0495) were seen in the  xxxd2513xxx  group
at weeks 3 and 4. constipation severity ratings were also
significantly improved (p ≤ 0.0175) at weeks 1, 3, and 4
for the  xxxd2513xxx  group.

no serious adverse effects were reported in clinical trials.  xxxd2513xxx  24 µg twice daily appears to be safe and
well tolerated.21,23-27 overall, the most commonly reported
adverse effect was nausea. only one double-blind study reported the frequency of nausea, which occurred in 21% of
patients on  xxxd2513xxx .25 pooled data analysis showed
that 31.1% of patients receiving  xxxd2513xxx  experienced
nausea, with the majority (88.7%) reporting the nausea to
be mild to moderate.34 nausea was severe in 3.4% of patients, causing 8.7% of these subjects to withdraw from
various studies.21 nausea appears to be dose related and
may be due to the delayed gastric emptying that occurs with
use of  xxxd2513xxx .20 when  xxxd2513xxx  was administered
with food, the nausea decreased. it was also demonstrated
that, among men and elderly patients, incidence of nausea
was lower (8.2% and 18.8%, respectively).34
diarrhea and headache were other commonly reported
adverse effects (13.2% and 13%, respectively). of these
patients, 3.4% reported severe diarrhea, with 2.2% discontinuing treatment.21,34 unlike nausea, diarrhea does not appear to be dose related, and no clinically significant serum
electrolyte disturbances were reported.19,21
other adverse effects include abdominal distension, abdominal pain, and vomiting, which occurred in more than
5% of patients.21 no significant trends in vital signs and
physical examinations were noted. electrocardiogram
measurements were normal throughout treatment periods,
and there were no significant changes in any laboratory parameters.21,26,35
 xxxd2513xxx  is listed as pregnancy category c. no adequate trials in pregnant women have been conducted; however, 4 patients did become pregnant while receiving  xxxd2513xxx . the medication was discontinued due to study
protocol and 3 of the 4 women delivered healthy babies.
the fourth patient was lost to follow-up. teratology studies have been conducted in rats receiving more than 300
times the recommended human dose and in rabbits receiv-

ing more than 33 times the recommended dose. there
were no reports of any teratogenic effects in these studies.
however, in guinea pigs, fetal loss occurred at doses 2–6
times that of the recommended human dose, administered
on days 40 –53 of gestation. it is unknown whether  xxxd2513xxx  is excreted in human milk.21
therapeutic issues and considerations
 xxxd2513xxx  has a relatively distinctive mechanism of
action compared with other current treatment options for
constipation. recent trials have demonstrated this drug to
be efficacious, with most patients having experienced an
sbm within 24 hours of taking the medication. adverse
effects experienced were reported to be generally mild. a
majority of the studies did not include the incidence of adverse events; therefore, their actual impact is difficult to assess. the patient population studied in these trials consisted
mainly of young women; therefore, efficacy and safety data
cannot be extrapolated to other subsets, such as the pediatric
population.  xxxd2513xxx  has not been studied in patients
younger than 18 years of age. the number of men studied in
the aforementioned trials was low, but this is consistent with
the overall prevalence of constipation. pharmacokinetic studies do not show a difference in effect between sexes.21
although  xxxd2513xxx  seems promising as treatment for
chronic constipation, available evidence has been presented only in abstract form, making it difficult to critically appraise raw data. publication is of full-text, peer-reviewed
articles describing the studies in detail is greatly needed so
that an informed assessment of  xxxd2513xxx ’s role in treating chronic constipation may be made. long-term data are
also necessary, as the use of this medication has not been
studied longer than 48 weeks.
it should be noted that a majority of the studies were
published by the same authors who were either employees
or consultants of the manufacturer. further studies should
be developed by independent researchers to limit bias.
adverse effects of  xxxd2513xxx  appear to be similar to
those of  xxxd3302xxx .14 however,  xxxd2513xxx ’s advantage is
its safety and efficacy data in patients greater than 65 years
of age.  xxxd3302xxx  was not approved for use in this age
group. compared with conventional anticonstipation medications, such as stimulant and saline laxatives, as well as hyperosmotic agents,  xxxd2513xxx  does not appear to produce
electrolyte abnormalities.21 comparison studies should be
done to ascertain how  xxxd2513xxx  performs in relation to
other drugs commonly used to treat chronic constipation
(table 2), as none are currently available.
summary/formulary recommendation
 xxxd2513xxx  has shown significant increases in sbm
compared with placebo in clinical trials. it has also demonwww.theannals.com

strated long-term efficacy in decreasing constipation severity, abdominal bloating, and discomfort. the drug’s relatively
benign safety profile may provide an advantage over conventional therapy; however, comparison studies are needed to
make a judicious assessment. to date, published studies were
conducted by the same cohort of investigators and are available only in abstract form. full-text, peer-reviewed studies
involving independent researchers are warranted.
considering the lack of peer-reviewed data and the relatively high cost of  xxxd2513xxx , we do not recommend
 xxxd2513xxx  as first-line therapy in chronic constipation.
rather, this drug should be reserved for patients who either
fail or are intolerant to standard therapy.

extracto

revisar la farmacología, la farmacocinética, la eficacia, y la
seguridad de la lubiprostona en el tratamiento de estreñimiento crónico.
además, se discutirá la evidencia clínica y las consideraciones
terapéuticas de la lubiprostona.
fuentes de información: se llevó a cabo una búsqueda en la literatura
utilizando pubmed/medline (1966–enero 2007), ingentaconnect, e
international pharmaceutical abstracts (1977–enero 2007). las
palabras clave incluyeron lubiprostona,  xxxd2513xxx , y estreñimiento
crónico.
objetivo:

selección de fuentes de información y método de extracción de
información: se evaluaron todos los artículos identificados en inglés de
las fuentes de información.
síntesis: la lubiprostona es un activador del canal de cloruro
clínicamente aprobado para el tratamiento de estreñimiento crónico. un
estudio aleatorio, doble ciego, de grupo paralelo y controlado con
placebo que evaluó la función gástrica demostró un retraso en el vaciado
gástrico y un aumento en el tiempo de tránsito del intestino delgado y el
colon. la información de la farmacocinética parece demostrar que su
nivel plasmático máximo es alrededor de 1.14 horas y la mayor parte del
medicamento se excreta principalmente en la orina dentro de 48 horas.
los estudios fase iii han demostrado que los pacientes con
estreñimiento crónico que utilizan la lubiprostona tienen un movimiento
intestinal espontáneo en 24 horas. los efectos adversos más comunes
fueron náuseas, diarrea, dolor abdominal, y dolor de cabeza. la
lubiprostona no ha sido estudiada en la población pediátrica.
conclusiones: la lubiprostona puede ser una alternativa razonable para
pacientes que no responden o no toleran la terapia regular para el
estreñimiento crónico. se necesitan estudios que comparen de uno a uno
con la terapia convencional para contrastar la eficacia clínica y la
seguridad de este medicamento.

résumé
objectif: analyser le profil pharmacologique, la pharmacocinétique,
l’efficacité clinique, la tolérance, et les précautions d’emploi en rapport
avec le  xxxd2513xxx  dans le traitement, de la constipation chronique. les
arguments cliniques seront également discutés, ainsi que les éléments du
traitement avec la  xxxd2513xxx .
revue de littérature: une recherche bibliographique a été menée à
l’aide de la base de données pubmed/medline (1966–janvier 2007),
du portail ingentaconnect, et d’international pharmaceutical abstracts
(1977–janvier 2007). les mots clés utilisés ont inclus:  xxxd2513xxx ,
 xxxd2513xxx , constipation chronique
selection de l’étude et sélection de l’information: tout article en
langue anglaise émanant de la revue de littérature a été évalué.
résumé: la  xxxd2513xxx  est un activateur des canaux chlorure sélectif
cliniquement approuvé dans le traitement de la constipation chronique.
une étude randomisée, à double insu, contrôlée par placebo et à groupes
parallèles évaluant la fonction gastrique a mis en évidence une vidange
gastrique ralentie et un transit grêlique et colique élevé. les données
pharmacocinétiques de la  xxxd2513xxx  semblent démontrer une
concentration plasmatique maximum d’environ 1.14 heures, avec une
plus grande quantité du médicament éliminé en 48 heures,
essentiellement par voie urinaire. la phase iii des essais a montré que
chez la plupart des patients souffrant de constipation chronique, les
selles surviennent spontanément dans les 24 heures. les effets
secondaires les plus fréquemment rencontrés furent des nausées, des
diarrhées, des douleurs abdominales, et des céphalées. la  xxxd2513xxx 
n’a pas été étudié au sein de la population pédiatrique.
conclusions: la  xxxd2513xxx  peut être une alternative légitime pour les
patients qui ne réagissent pas ou qui sont intolérants au traitement type
de la constipation chronique. des études comparatives avec le traitement
classique sont nécessaires afin d’évaluer les différences d’efficacité et de
tolérance de ce médicament.
