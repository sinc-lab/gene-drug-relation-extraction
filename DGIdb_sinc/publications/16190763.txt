inhibition of aromatase is an efficient approach for the prevention and treatment of breast
cancer. new a,d-ring modified steroid analogues of  xxxd2153xxx  and  xxxd3324xxx  were designed
and synthesized and their biochemical activity was investigated in vitro in an attempt to find
new aromatase inhibitors and to gain insight into their structure-activity relationships (sar).
all compounds tested were less active than  xxxd2153xxx . however, the 3-deoxy steroidal olefin
3a and its epoxide derivative 4a proved to be strong competitive aromatase inhibitors (ki ) 50
and 38 nm and ic50 ) 225 and 145 nm, respectively). according to our findings, the c-3 carbonyl
group is not essential for anti-aromatase activity, but 5r-stereochemistry and some planarity
in the steroidal framework is required. furthermore, modification of the steroidal cyclopentanone d-ring, by construction of a delta-lactone six-membered ring, decreases the inhibitory
potency. from the results obtained, it may be concluded that the binding pocket of the active
site of aromatase requires planarity in the region of the steroid a,b-rings and the d-ring
structure is critical for the binding.
introduction
estrogens are required for normal tissue growth and
development, but they are also responsible for the
promotion of certain tumors, such as prostatic hyperplasia, prostate, endometrial, and especially breast
cancers.1 in fact, 30-50% of breast cancers are considered to be estrogen-dependent,2,3 and regression can be
achieved by reducing blood and tissue estrogen levels.
the highest incidence of breast cancer occurs in postmenopausal women,4 whose ovarian function and hypophyseal control of estrogen production has ceased. in
these women, estrogen biosynthesis occurs mostly in
peripheral tissues such as liver, skin, muscle, and
adipose tissue.5-7 for this reason, total blockage of
estrogen biosynthesis is easier to achieve by chemical
means rather than by surgical therapy.8 two main
chemical approaches have been successfully applied as
endocrine therapy of estrogen-dependent breast cancer.
one is directed to the  xxxg730xxx  by use of
selective  xxxg730xxx  modulators (serms), among
which tamoxifen is the most popular one. the other is
directed to aromatase, the key enzyme responsible for
estrogen biosynthesis.9,10 since estrogens are formed in
the last step of the biosynthetic sequence of steroid
production, aromatase inhibition provides a basis for the
development of selective chemotherapies for treatment
and prevention of estrogen-sensitive breast cancers.11
furthermore, the therapeutic potential of aromatase
inhibitors stretches beyond postmenopausal women
with breast cancer, because these inhibitors have also

been shown to be clinically relevant in the management
of other estrogen-dependent pathological processes such
as endometriosis,12 gynecomastia, prostatic hyperplasia,
and prostate cancer.13 for these reasons, several steroidal aromatase inhibitors, based on the structure of
the natural substrate androstenedione, have been designed and synthesized in several laboratories. exemestane and the well-established  xxxd2153xxx  (figure 1) are
two examples of these kinds of compounds that are
known to be very efficient in the treatment of patients
in whom other anti-estrogen therapies failed.8,14
in the present study our focus is on the design,
synthesis, and biochemical evaluation of a new series
of substituted steroids containing modifications in the
a- and d-rings. the new compounds were obtained by
chemical modifications to the structure of the natural
enzyme substrate, androstenedione, to achieve new
aromatase inhibitors in order to further study the
structure-activity relationships (sar). the studied
sar were correlated with three main features, namely,
the a-ring substitution pattern and the planarity of this

ring, the c-5 stereochemistry in the a/b-ring fusion, and
the d-ring structure. numazawa and co-workers15-18
have performed several sar studies in steroid aromatase inhibitors indicating the existence of a binding
pocket in the active site of the enzyme, which can
accommodate several chemical groups placed at the c-4
position of the steroids. according to this information,

cepa et al.

we embarked on the design, synthesis, and biochemical
evaluation of some c-4 oxo- (2), c-4 keto- (6 and 10),
c-4 hydroxy- (5a, 5b, and 8), and c-4 hydroxycyano(11) substituted androstanes (schemes 1 and 2). in the
same way, the c-3 carbonyl group of the substrate
androstenedione has been thought to be important to
the binding of aromatase and is also present in many
inhibitors. however, some recent studies have shown
that this group could be removed if some planarity were
maintained in the steroid a-ring.16,18 for this reason,
we prepared the 3-deoxy steroids 3a, 4a, and 4b
(schemes 1 and 2) having olefin and epoxy groups, that
confer the desired planarity to the a-ring, and evaluated
their inhibitory activity. we were also interested in
studying the effect of the c-5 stereochemistry of the a/bring fusion on drug-receptor interaction, so the 5r/betaepimers 4a/4b and 5a/5b were prepared and evaluated.
with respect to the steroid d-ring, there are not many
modifications reported in the literature. however, some
delta-lactone d-ring steroids such as  xxxd3324xxx , the first
steroidal aromatase inhibitor clinically used for breast
cancer treatment (figure 1),19 have also shown anti-

to prepare and evaluate the delta-lactone d-ring steroids
8, 9, 10, and 11 (scheme 2). furthermore, successful

chemistry. all steroids were prepared from androstenedione 1 by the routes depicted in schemes 1 and 2.
the a-ring lactone aldehyde 2 was first obtained as a
byproduct in a synthetic route for aromatase inhibitors
previously developed in our laboratory. it was formed
through a rearrangement, which occurred after controlled oxidation of 1 in methanol with alkaline potassium permanganate (tavares da silva, unpublished
results). clemmenson-type reduction of 1 with zinc dust
in acetic acid solution afforded the isomeric mixture (2.3:
1, by nmr) of the 5r- and 5beta-olefins 3a and 3b in
almost quantitative yield. separation of the pure 3a
(60%) from the mixture was achieved by n-hexane
crystallization.20
treatment of 5r-androst-3-en-17-one 3a (scheme 2)
with performic acid generated in situ led, after workup,
to the trans-diaxial diol, 3r,4beta-dihydroxy-5r-androstan17-one 5a, in 96% yield. the 3r,4r-epoxide 4a was also
obtained from the reaction of 3a with performic acid but
with methylene chloride as reaction solvent instead. in
this case, due to the low solubility of the resulting formic
acid in this solvent, further cleavage of the epoxide
intermediate was prevented and 4a was the only
product formed, also in near quantitative yield. epoxide
4b was prepared as described for 4a but with a 1:3
mixture of 3a and 3b as starting material. the abovementioned mixture has been used as we could not
isolate the pure 3b from it. under these conditions a
1:3 mixture of epoxides 4a and 4b was obtained, from
which 4b was easily isolated by crystallization. treatment of 4b with 90%  xxxd2154xxx  solution afforded a
mixture of two other diols and of the desired 3,4-transdiaxial diol 5b, which was isolated by crystallization or
column chromatography in 48% yield.20 swern-type
oxidation of 5a with  xxxd1896xxx , activated with
trifluoroacetic anhydride, gave quantitatively kinetic
diosphenol, the 3-hydroxy-5r-androst-2-ene-4, xxxd2153xxx ,21 which by acid- or base-catalyzed isomerization
with hcl/ch3cooh or naome/meoh led to the desired thermodynamic diosphenol  xxxd2153xxx  7 as the only
product, formed in 80% yield. the same swern-type
oxidation applied to 5beta-diol 5b afforded a mixture with
a variable composition (1:2 to 2:1, by nmr) of a
5beta-kinetic diosphenol, the 3-hydroxy-5beta-androst-2-ene4, xxxd2153xxx ,20 and an unstable triketone, the 5beta-androstane-3,4,17-trione,20 which after acid- or base-catalyzed
isomerization were also converted in similar yield to
diosphenol 7. treatment of diol 5a in methylene chloride
with oxone catalyzed with alumina in the heterogeneous
phase allowed the selective oxidation of the c-4 hydroxyl
group, affording the r-ketol 6. baeyer-villiger oxidation
of the 17-keto group of 5a with monoperoxyphthalic acid
magnesium salt hexahydrate (mmpp) yielded the dihydroxylactone derivative 8 in 90-94% yield. further
oxidation of 8 with  xxxd1896xxx  activated with
trifluoroacetic anhydride gave a kinetic diosphenol, the

biochemical properties. inhibition of aromatase
activity by the newly prepared a- and d-ring modified
steroids was evaluated in human placental microsomes
by a radiometric assay in which tritiated water, released
from [1beta-3h]androstenedione into the incubation medium, was used as an index of estrogen formation.23 the
results of these studies are shown as percentage of
inhibition for all compounds at 2 µm, relative to an
assay in the absence of an inhibitor (table 1). the wellknown aromatase inhibitor  xxxd2153xxx 
(figure 1), with an inhibitory capacity of 99.1% ( 0.04%,
was used as reference. for the inhibitors showing antiaromatase activity equal to or higher than 70% (3a, 4a,
6, and 9), ic50 was determined in saturating concentrations (200 nm) of androstenedione. in addition, the type
of binding to the active site of aromatase was characterized and the apparent inhibition constant (ki) was
determined by use of different inhibitor and substrate
concentrations. the inhibition kinetic studies were
performed with human placental microsomes and the
results were plotted as lineweaver-burk plots. the
inhibition type of all compounds tested was competitive.
a representative lineweaver-burk plot of aromatase
inhibition is shown in figure 2 for  xxxd543xxx . the
apparent inhibition constants (ki), which characterize
the enzyme affinity, were obtained by dixon plots
(figure 3). the ic50 value for  xxxd2153xxx  was evaluated
in our test system and used for comparison. this
compound presented higher inhibitory activity than all
the synthesized compounds. the ic50, ki, type of inhibition and km/ki ratios for the more active inhibitors are
shown in table 2. in these studies, the apparent km and
vmax values for aromatase with androstenedione as
substrate were 57.5 nm and 48 pmol min-1 (µg of
protein)-1, respectively.

affinity for the enzyme than its natural substrate
androstenedione (ki ) 50 nm versus km ) 57.5 nm,
respectively). compound 4a, the 5r-epimer of the 3,4epoxide, showed 96.4% ( 0.1% inhibition of aromatase,
revealing it to be the best competitive inhibitor among
all the compounds studied in this work. this epoxide
4a presented an ic50 ) 145 nm and was found to bind
the enzyme with an affinity 1.5 times higher (ki ) 38
nm) than that of the natural substrate (57.5 nm).
numazawa et al.16 have already reported that 3-deoxy4-ene and 3-deoxy-5-ene derivatives of androstenedione
are competitive inhibitors of aromatase. in this work
we pointed out that, in addition to these derivatives,
the 3-deoxy-3-ene derivative 3a of androstenedione is

cepa et al.

also a strong competitive inhibitor of aromatase. furthermore, the 3,4-epoxide derivative 4a, which has the
same stereochemistry requirements in the a-ring, is also
a strong competitive aromatase inhibitor. these results
stress the importance of a-ring planarity in the interaction with the active site of the enzyme. the lack of a
c-3 carbonyl group in these compounds also indicates
that this feature is not a determinant for inhibition, as
previously observed by numazawa.16,24 compound 5a,
the 5r-epimer of a 3,4-diol, showed an inhibition of
34.6% ( 1.0%, and its 4-keto derivative, the r-ketol 6,
showed a significant increase in the inhibitory capacity
of 83.3% ( 1.3%. these results demonstrate, once more,
the importance of the planarity in the a-ring for the
inhibition, now conferred by a c-4 carbonyl group in 6.
compound 2, a 4-oxa steroid with a 5r-aldehyde group
showed only 11.0% ( 1.9% inhibition. in this way, more
studies should be performed in order to understand the
influence of 4-oxa and 5r-aldehyde groups in the antiaromatase activity.
the effect of the c-5 stereochemistry on the inhibition
of aromatase was studied for the 5r/beta-epimers 4a/4b
and 5a/5b. within the 3,4-epoxide derivatives 4a and
4b, the 5r-substituted steroid 4a showed 96.4% aromatase inhibition in contrast to the corresponding 5betaepimer 4b, which had a dramatic reduction in inhibition
(14.6% ( 1.6%). within compounds 5a and 5b, the 5repimer of the 3,4-diol 5a inhibited aromatase 34.6%,
whereas the correspondent 5beta-epimer 5b showed a
decrease in the inhibitory activity (10.1% ( 1.8%). these
results indicate that the angle formed in the a/b-ring
junction is crucial in order to better fit the enzymatic
active site. the 5beta-epimers, in which a- and b-rings are
almost perpendicular, will not be well accommodated
by the enzyme.
the effect of the d-ring modification in the inhibition
of aromatase was observed in steroids 8, 9, and 10, in
which six-membered delta-lactone rings were introduced.
 xxxd543xxx , combining the diosphenol a-ring of the
potent inhibitor  xxxd2153xxx  and the delta-lactone d-ring of
 xxxd3324xxx  (figure 1), showed 72.5% aromatase inhibition and an ic50 ) 1.85 µm, compared to 99.1% ( 0.04%
and ic50 ) 0.042 µm for  xxxd2153xxx . similar reduction
in the inhibitory capacity was observed for the pair of
compounds 6 and 10, which showed inhibitory activities
of 83.3% ( 1.3% and 16.6% ( 1.5%, respectively.
compound 6 was a competitive inhibitor of aromatase,
with ic50 ) 670 nm. it blocks the enzyme activity to a
much greater extent than the corresponding d-ring
lactone compound 10 (ic50 > 100 µm). in the same way,
compound 5a showed an inhibitory activity of 34.6% (
1.0%, while the introduction of the delta-lactone ring,
yielding derivative 8, strongly affects inhibition (8.1%
( 1.8%). these results suggest that the inhibitory
activity of  xxxd3324xxx  is probably not due to its delta-lactone d-ring. compound 11, the 4-cyano derivative of 8,
showed a slight increase in the inhibitory activity (17.6%
( 1.6%) compared to its precursor. the chemically
reactive cyano group in the c-4 position of this compound is also present in the most recent third generation cyano azole-type aromatase inhibitors,25 revealing
it to be an important feature for enzyme inhibition. this
result also indicates that the c-4 position is a critical
region for the interaction of steroids with aromatase.

conclusions
our data showed that modification in the a- and
d-rings of androstenedione provides potent, easily
available, and structurally simple aromatase inhibitors.
nevertheless, none of the compounds prepared was
shown to be a stronger inhibitor than  xxxd2153xxx . only
specific changes were allowed in the a-ring of steroids
in order to obtain potent inhibitors. the c-3 carbonyl
is not a determinant group for the interaction of the
studied steroids with the enzyme and for its inhibition.
in fact, the 3-deoxy compounds 3a and 4a were demonstrated to be strong competitive inhibitors of aromatase. they have also shown higher affinity toward
the enzyme than its natural substrate androstenedione.
these results suggest that a 3,4-double bond or a 3,4epoxide group will confer the a-ring planarity required
for anti-aromatase activity, according to the previous
observations by numazawa and co-workers.15-18,24 epoxide 4a proved to be the most potent inhibitor, revealing that, in addition to planarity, the oxygen atom near
the c-4 region will be important for activity. a c-4
carbonyl group, as observed in 6, may also contribute
to the above-mentioned requirements for anti-aromatase
activity. in addition to planarity in the a-ring, planarity
in the a/b-ring junction of the steroids seems also to be
important for enzyme inhibition. our results therefore
stress that the 5r-stereochemistry is required for inhibition. concerning the d-ring, the replacement of the
original steroid cyclopentanone ring by a six-membered
delta-lactone ring reduces the inhibitory activity. the
magnitude of this reduction seems to be also dependent
on the substitution pattern in the a-ring, as observed
for compounds 8, 9, and 10. this modification in the
d-ring may induce structural alterations in the steroidal
framework, affecting their ability to bind to the active
site of the enzyme.
the preliminary biological profile indicates that it is
important to synthesize new steroid derivatives in order
to refine the encountered sar for the prepared compounds.

chemistry: 3,17-dioxo-4-oxaandrostane-5r-carbaldehyde (2). to a cold (-5 °c) stirred solution of androst-4-ene3, xxxd2153xxx  1 (3.0 g, 10.5 mmol) in 200 ml of methanol, a 2.5%
solution of potassium permanganate in aqueous koh, 0.05 n
(130 ml, 20.6 mmol), was added dropwise. the temperature
was then raised to 15 °c and after 5-10 min the excess oxidant
was destroyed with saturated aqueous na2s2o5 (20 ml). after
separation of the formed mno2 by centrifugation, the methanol
was evaporated and the solution diluted with water (200 ml),
neutralized with aqueous 1 n h2so4, and extracted with ch2cl2 (3 × 100 ml). the organic extract was washed with 10%
aqueous na2s2o5 (100 ml) and then water (2 × 100 ml), dried
( xxxd2534xxx ), and evaporated to dryness to give 1.36 g (41%) of a
crude product from where the title compound 2 was isolated
by crystallization from  xxxd102xxx .
5r- and 5beta-androst-3-en-17-one (3a and 3b). the title
olefins 3a and 3b were prepared from  xxxd176xxx 
1 (500 mg, 1.75 mmol) through a clemmenson-type reduction
with zinc dust in acetic acid, according to the reaction
conditions previously described.20 the crude product obtained
as a white crystalline solid (476 mg) was composed of an
isomeric mixture (2.3:1 by nmr) of 5r-olefin 3a and 5beta-olefin
3b. crystallization of the mixture from n-hexane gave the pure
3a (285 mg, 60%). the 5beta-epimer 3b could not be isolated and
has been identified in the mixture with the 5r-epimer only by
1h and 13c nmr.

by further acid-catalyzed isomerization, was quantitatively
(99%) converted in the title thermodynamic diosphenol 9.
3r-hydroxy-17a-oxa-17a-homo-5r-androstane-4,  xxxd2153xxx  (10). to a solution of the dihydroxylactone 8 (100 mg, 0.31
mmol) in analar methylene chloride (2.0 ml), and 10 drops of
methanol were added alumina [alo3, w200 acid activity super
i (0% h2o), 335 mg] and oxone (250 mg, 0.41 mmol). the
suspension was stirred at room temperature (18 °c) until the
steroid was consumed (6 h, tlc, ethyl acetate/n-hexane 5:1).
after dilution with dried ( xxxd2534xxx ) methylene chloride, the
suspension was filtered and the filtrate was washed with the
same solvent (200 ml) and evaporated to dryness to give a
crude white solid (97-99 mg, 97.6-99.6%), from which the
pure title r-ketol-lactone 10 was isolated by crystallization.
4xi-cyano-3r,4xi-dihydroxy-17a-oxa-17a-homo-5r-androstan-17-one (11). to 50 mg (0.156 mmol) of the r-ketollactone 10 were added acetone cyanohydrin (99.5 µl, 1.08
mmol) and triethylamine (7.75 µl), and the suspension was
stirred at room temperature for 4 h until the reaction was
complete (tlc). the reaction mixture was then poured into
water (5-10 ml) with ice (5-10 g) and acetic acid (0.25-0.5
ml) under magnetic stirring. the precipitated product was
filtered, washed with water followed by methylene chloride,
and crystallized from ethyl acetate, giving the title cyanohydrin 11 as a white powder.
biochemistry: preparation of placental microsomes.
placental microsomes were obtained as described by yoshida
and osawa26 with some modifications. human placentas
obtained after delivery from a local hospital were placed in
cold 67 mm potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) containing
1% kcl. the cotyledon tissue was separated and homogenized
in a polytron homogenizer with 67 mm potassium phosphate
buffer (ph 7.4) containing 0.25 m sucrose and 0.5 mm
dithiothreitol (dtt, 1:1 w/v). the homogenate was centrifuged
at 5000g for 30 min. the supernatant was centrifuged twice
at 20000g for 30 min and at 148000g for 45 min to yield a
microsomal pellet. the microsomes were washed and resuspended in 67 mm potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4)
containing 0.25 m sucrose, 20% glycerol, and 0.5 mm dtt and
stored at -80 °c. all procedures were carried out at 0-5 °c.
protein content was estimated by the bradford method,27 with
bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) as standard. no significant
enzyme activity loss occurred after 6 months.
aromatase assay procedure. aromatase activity was
measured according to thompson and siiteri23 and heidrich
et al.28 aromatase activity was evaluated by measuring the
3
h2o released from [1beta-3h]androstenedione during aromatization. all tested compounds were dissolved in ethanol and
diluted in 67 mm potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4). briefly,
for the screening assay, 20 µg of protein of the microsomes,
40 nm [1beta-3h]androstenedione (1 µci) purchased from perkinelmer life sciences, and 2 µm each of the inhibitors were used,
while for the ic50 determination, 200 nm (1 µci) androstenedione and different concentrations of the inhibitors were used.
the aromatase-catalyzed reaction was initiated by the addition
of  xxxd532xxx  phosphate (nadph, 150 µm), and incubations were performed in a shaking
water bath at 37 °c for 15 min. however, to minimize the timedependent loss of the initial aromatization rate, 10-30 nm
[1beta-3h]androstenedione and 5 min incubation time were used
for the kinetic studies. the reaction was terminated by
addition of 500 µl of ice-cold distilled water and 1.5 ml of
ice-cold chloroform. after centrifugation at 3200g for 10 min,
the aqueous phase was added to 5% charcoal/0.5% dextran
coated. after a new centrifugation cycle, the resulting supernatant was mixed with 1.5 ml of chloroform and centrifuged.
the purified aqueous supernatant containing 3h2o was mixed
with a liquid scintillation cocktail (universol) and counted in
a beckman liquid scintillation spectrometer (ls6500). all
experiments were carried out in triplicate.
