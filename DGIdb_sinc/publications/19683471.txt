cellular mechanisms of insulin resistance: role of stressregulated serine kinases and  xxxg1194xxx  substrates (irs)
serine phosphorylation
jean-francÃßois tanti1,2 and jennifer jager1,2
 xxxg1194xxx  substrates (irs) serine phosphorylation is a
time-controlled physiological feedback mechanism in insulin
signaling that is hijacked by metabolic and inflammatory
stresses to promote insulin resistance. kinases, including
 xxxg1159xxx , jnk, erk, mtor, and  xxxg1989xxx , activated by the inducers of
insulin resistance induce uncontrolled irs serine
phosphorylation. studies with genetically modified mice reveal
that these kinases integrate signals from metabolic and
inflammatory stresses in adipose tissue, liver, and
hypothalamus leading to peripheral and central insulin
resistance. moreover,  xxxg1159xxx / xxxg1559xxx  and  xxxg1370xxx  pathways in
myeloid cells represent a core mechanism involved in
inflammation linked to obesity. these kinases are thus potential
drug targets against insulin resistance and the targeting of the
 xxxg1159xxx / xxxg1559xxx  or the jnk pathway may evolve into future
diabetes medication.

introduction
insulin resistance is a major metabolic feature of obesity
and is a central component of the metabolic syndrome, a
set of metabolic abnormalities. insulin resistance is an
important pathophysiological factor in the development
of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular, and liver diseases [1].
insulin resistance results from a complex interplay between nutrient overload, systemic  xxxd2154xxx  excess,
inflammation of the adipose tissue, endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stresses [2] and hypoxia of the adipose
tissue [3]. at the molecular level, inflammatory cytokines,  xxxd2154xxx  derivatives, such as ceramides and
www.sciencedirect.com

diacylglycerol, and ros, activate several serine/threonine
kinases that have emerged as important negative regulators of insulin signaling by targeting key components of
this pathway.
here, we discuss recent evidences implicating the serine
phosphorylation of  xxxg1194xxx  substrates (irs) and
irs serine kinases in insulin resistance. we place particular emphasis on pharmacological and genetic studies that
support the targeting of these kinases as new avenues to
fight insulin resistance.

 xxxg1198xxx  and  xxxg1199xxx  serine phosphorylation and
insulin resistance
tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor molecules  xxxg1198xxx /
2 by the  xxxg1194xxx  (ir) allows the binding and
activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi 3kinase) and the subsequent activation of pkb, atypical
pkcs and mammalian  xxxg1478xxx  (mtor) pathways that are involved in the anabolic actions of insulin.
in terms of structure, both  xxxg1198xxx  and  xxxg1199xxx  contain a
pleckstrin homology (ph) and a  xxxd1075xxx  binding
(ptb) domains at the n-terminus. the ph domain
brings irs proteins to the membrane in proximity to
the ir. the ptb domain of irs binds to the phosphorylated tyrosine 960 located in a npxy motif of the juxtamembrane region of the ir [1].
in addition to promote  xxxg1198xxx  tyrosine phosphorylation,
insulin increases the serine phosphorylation of several
sites in  xxxg1198xxx  [4]. the development of mass spectrometry
analysis has recently allowed the global assessment of
their regulation [5]. insulin induces the phosphorylation
of a complex array of sites that allows the fine-tuning of
its signaling. phosphorylation of serine residues in  xxxg1198xxx 
has positive, negative, or both positive and negative
effects on insulin signaling [6,7] (figure 1). the complexity of this regulation can be explained by the finding
that a pattern of phosphorylation rather than the phosphorylation of one site is required to regulate  xxxg1198xxx 
function [8]. moreover, the same phosphorylation site
may exert different functions in insulin action depending
on the time course of phosphorylation and the phosphorylation of other sites [6,7]. the emerging picture is
that positive regulatory sites may be phosphorylated first
and may protect  xxxg1198xxx  from the phosphorylation of
inhibitory sites [6,7,9] or from the association with
tyrosine phosphatases [10] leading to sustain tyrosine

serine phosphorylation sites in irs proteins and serine kinases involved. serine phosphorylation of irs proteins is a mechanism shared by insulin and
several inducers of insulin resistance such as inflammatory cytokines, free  xxxd2154xxx , ros. in physiological conditions insulin induces the phosphorylation
of an array of sites in time-controlled manner. positive regulatory sites (+) are phosphorylated first by kinases in the insulin signaling pathways such as pkb
and pkcz. this phosphorylation allows a correct tyrosine phosphorylation of  xxxg1198xxx  and the propagation of the insulin signal. inhibitory sites ( ) are
phosphorylated later on by pkcz and mtor/ xxxg1989xxx  and decrease the tyrosine phosphorylation of  xxxg1198xxx  leading to the termination of the insulin signal. some
sites have both positive and negative (+ ) effects depending on the time course of phosphorylation and the phosphorylation of other sites. in
pathophysiological conditions, inducers of insulin resistance activate several serine kinases such as  xxxg1159xxx , jnk, erk,  xxxg1989xxx  that phosphorylate  xxxg1198xxx  protein
on inhibitory sites in an uncontrolled manner. serine phosphorylation of  xxxg1199xxx  is also involved in the regulation of its tyrosine phosphorylation. the
identification of serine and threonine phosphorylation sites and kinases is beginning. phosphorylation of ser488 by jnk primes ser484 for phosphorylation
by gsk-3 resulting in an inhibition of insulin signaling. jnk also phosphorylates the threonine348 located at the end of the ptb domain. by analogy with
 xxxg1198xxx , this phosphorylation may disrupt the interaction between ir and  xxxg1199xxx . abbreviation: ph, pleckstrin homology domain; ptb,  xxxd1075xxx

phosphorylation. inhibitory sites are phosphorylated
later on and shut down insulin signaling. the inhibitory
sites are clustered near the ptb domain and their phosphorylation disrupts the interaction between  xxxg1198xxx  and
ir and promotes the degradation of  xxxg1198xxx . these sites are
also located in the c-terminal tail of  xxxg1198xxx  where they
negatively regulate the interaction between  xxxg1198xxx  and pi
3-kinase [4,11] (figure 1). these inhibitory sites are
current opinion in pharmacology 2009, 9:753‚Äì762

phosphorylated by several serine kinases in response
to insulin such as mtor, p70s6 kinase ( xxxg1989xxx ), and
atypical pkczeta [8,11,12]. importantly, several inducers of insulin resistance also promote the phosphorylation of these inhibitory sites through activation of c-jun
n-terminal kinases (jnk), inhibitory-kb kinase b
( xxxg1159xxx ), mtor/ xxxg1989xxx , extracellular signal regulated
kinases (erk), sik-2, and pkcu [4,11] (figure 1).

however, whereas in physiological conditions, insulin
induces a delicate balance between the phosphorylation
of positive and negative regulatory sites, in pathophysiological conditions the phosphorylation of only the
negative sites and/or the disruption of these time-controlled serine phosphorylation events might disturb the
propagation of insulin signaling. the causative role of
this complex interplay between sites in the development
of insulin resistance in vivo was recently demonstrated.
indeed, mice expressing  xxxg1198xxx  protein mutated on
important regulatory serine residues in muscles are partly
protected against diet-induced insulin resistance [13].
identification of phosphorylated serine sites in  xxxg1199xxx  is
just beginning.  xxxg1199xxx  is phosphorylated by jnk at threonine348 located at the end of its ptb domain [14]. by
analogy with  xxxg1198xxx , this phosphorylation may disrupt the
interaction between ir and  xxxg1199xxx . jnk also phosphorylates ser488 that primes ser484 for phosphorylation by
gsk-3 resulting in an inhibition of insulin signaling [15]
(figure 1).
as discussed above several serine kinases phosphorylate
 xxxg1198xxx  (figure 1) and the following sections discuss the
implication of some of these kinases in the development
of insulin resistance and the control of whole-body metabolism.

the  xxxg1159xxx / xxxg1559xxx  inflammatory pathway and
insulin resistance
the  xxxg1159xxx  is the master regulator of  xxxg1559xxx  activation in
response to inflammatory stimuli.  xxxg1159xxx  is activated by
the inducers of insulin resistance such as the inflammatory cytokines and free  xxxd2154xxx  and  xxxg1159xxx  activity and/
or expression are increased in obese patients [16]. in
various insulin target cells, the inhibition of  xxxg1159xxx  activity
prevents the deleterious effects of  xxxg2296xxx  or  xxxd2154xxx  on
insulin signaling [17]. at the molecular level,  xxxg1159xxx 
promotes  xxxg1198xxx  serine phosphorylation through a direct
phosphorylation [18] or through a crosstalk between other
kinases [19,20] (figure 2). a newly described inhibitory
effect of  xxxg1159xxx / xxxg1559xxx  is the upregulation of the tyrosine
phosphatase ptb1b (figure 2) that downregulates ir
and  xxxg1198xxx  tyrosine phosphorylation [21].
mice with a heterozygous deletion of  xxxg1159xxx  challenged
with a high-fat diet (hfd) or rendered leptin deficient
display better insulin sensitivity [22]. of note, the protective effect of this haploinsufficiency was not found in
another study [23]. studies involving tissue-specific
deficient mice demonstrate that muscle  xxxg1159xxx  does not
play a major role in insulin resistance [23] whereas the
invalidation of  xxxg1159xxx  in hepatocytes prevents hepatic
insulin resistance and to some extent improves systemic
insulin sensitivity [24,25]. conversely, constitutive activation of  xxxg1159xxx  in liver promotes hepatic insulin resistance
[26]. moreover,  xxxg1159xxx  invalidation in myeloid cells
www.sciencedirect.com

prevents the development of systemic insulin resistance
[25]. although the observed effects could be due to an
effect of  xxxg1159xxx  on insulin signaling or other pathways, the
major information of these studies is that  xxxg1159xxx / xxxg1559xxx 
pathway acts in the liver and in the myeloid cells to induce
inflammatory cytokines that promote insulin resistance
locally or systemically (figure 2). activation of the inflammatory  xxxg1159xxx / xxxg1559xxx  pathway in the hypothalamus by
overnutrition has also been recently proposed as a mechanism involved in hypothalamic insulin and leptin resistance through the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress
and socs3. this mechanism contributes to energy imbalance and weight gain [27]. thus, activation of  xxxg1159xxx /nfkb pathway is a core mechanism that connects metabolic
inflammation and insulin resistance both in peripheral
tissues and in the central nervous system (table 1).
these findings make  xxxg1159xxx / xxxg1559xxx  attractive targets for
the development of drugs to treat insulin resistance and
diabetes. aspirin and salicylate not only are cyclooxygenase inhibitors but also function as  xxxg1159xxx  inhibitors [28].
salicylate improves insulin sensitivity of obese mice and
of mice treated with a  xxxd2154xxx  infusion [17]. several
decades ago, high doses of aspirin were reported to have
beneficial effects in the treatment of diabetic patients and
a recent study has confirmed this initial observation [17].
however, the high dose of aspirin used to impact on
insulin resistance precludes its utilisation for the treatment of diabetes. in contrast to aspirin,  xxxd3163xxx , a nonacetylated dimer of  xxxd3159xxx , has an established
safety profile with limited side-effect on bleeding risks
and gastrointestinal disorders. proof-of-concept studies
and small trials using  xxxd3163xxx  [29,30,31] suggest that
therapies targeting the  xxxg1159xxx / xxxg1559xxx  pathway may evolve
into future diabetes medication.

the map kinases jnk and erk in insulin
resistance
jnk and erk belong to the mitogen activated protein
kinase family. metabolic and inflammatory stresses
increase the activity of jnk and erk in several tissues
during obesity and type 2 diabetes [32,33] and these
kinases induce the serine phosphorylation of  xxxg1198xxx  or
 xxxg1199xxx  [4,14,15] (figure 2). erk pathway also mediates
the downregulation of  xxxg1198xxx  expression induced by
inflammatory cytokines [34].
among the different isoforms of jnk and erk,  xxxg1370xxx 
and  xxxg1369xxx  play a major role in the development of
obesity and insulin resistance in vivo (table 1). full-body
invalidation of  xxxg1370xxx  results in a decrease in weight
gain on hfd and in a reduction in insulin resistance
with a decrease in  xxxg1198xxx  serine phosphorylation [35].
 xxxg1372xxx  deficient mice are also protected against obesityinduced insulin resistance but only when  xxxg1370xxx  activity is
partially reduced [36] suggesting that  xxxg1372xxx  function
could be compensated by  xxxg1370xxx . the observation that

a network of serine kinases is involved in the downregulation of insulin signaling. in obesity and diabetes, a network of serine kinases is activated that
targets irs proteins and downregulates insulin signaling. some of these kinases such as pkcz and mtorc1/ xxxg1989xxx  are in the insulin signaling pathway
(in grey in the figure). they are involved in both the propagation of the insulin signal and its termination through a negative feedback mechanism. other
kinases (in pink in the figure) are more specifically activated by inflammatory cytokines,  xxxd2154xxx , amino acids, and ros. irs proteins are major
targets of the network of kinases and some of them are involved in the inflammatory state linked to obesity (see text for details). abbreviation: ir,

inflammatory parameters are decreased in  xxxg1370xxx  deficient
mice [35] and that jnk pathway exerts proinflammatory
action in macrophages of the adipose tissue [37] has led to
the hypothesis that  xxxg1370xxx  activity in myeloid cells
regulated the development of insulin resistance. using
bone marrow transplantation experiments, two studies
have established that  xxxg1370xxx  activation in myeloid cells
makes a major contribution to hfd-induced inflammation (figure 2) but they diverge concerning its importance to drive the development of insulin resistance
[38,39]. it is likely that  xxxg1370xxx  activation in insulin target
cells is important as well. indeed, whereas muscle  xxxg1370xxx 
does not contribute to insulin resistance [40], hepatic
reduction of  xxxg1370xxx  activity improves insulin sensitivity
and hepatic steatosis [41,42]. interestingly, adiposespecific  xxxg1370xxx  invalidation also prevents hepatic insulin

resistance through a reduction in adipose tissue secreted
il-6, an important mediator of hepatic insulin resistance
[43]. thus, high level of  xxxg1370xxx  activity in adipose tissue
could promote insulin resistance through the deregulation of adipocytokines. in agreement with this hypothesis, in flies, jnk signaling in the fat body is necessary for
stress-induced lipocalin expression in order to inhibit
insulin signaling and to adjust metabolism and growth
[44]. abnormal lipocalin expression is linked to insulin
resistance in human [45] and future studies are needed to
test the implication of jnk.
concerning erk pathway,  xxxg1369xxx  deficient mice are protected against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance
owing to decreased adipogenesis and elevated energy
expenditure [46]. conversely, mice deficient in the

signaling adapter p62, an erk inhibitor, have a high basal
level of erk activity and develop mature-onset obesity
and insulin resistance [47].
pharmacological inhibition of jnk, by atp competitive
inhibitors, leads to protective effects against insulin resistance in mice but this first generation of inhibitors have a
poor selectivity [48]. many jnk inhibitors with greater
potency and selectivity have been disclosed [49,50] and
one of them has demonstrated beneficial effects on weight
gain and insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obese mice
[49]. however, complementary studies are needed to
confirm that these effects are the consequences of jnk
inhibition. in addition to atp competitive inhibitors,
small substrate-competitive inhibitors of jnk have been
recently identified [51,52]. these chemical compounds
disrupt the interaction between jnk and the scaffolding
protein  xxxg1371xxx  (jnk-interacting protein-1) that connects
jnk and upstream kinases and they restore insulin sensitivity in db/db mice [52]. this type of inhibitors could be
an innovative class of therapeutic agents with a highest
selectivity and potency and can open new avenues in the
treatment of type 2 diabetes and other diseases.

mtor signaling pathway and insulin
resistance
mtor pathway integrates insulin and amino acids/nutrient signaling pathways. mtor is associated with two
distinct protein complexes (mtorc1 and mtorc2).
current opinion in pharmacology 2009, 9:753‚Äì762

the mtorc2 complex is insensitive to rapamycin and
includes mtor and rictor [53]. this complex is involved
in the activation of pkb and other agc kinases [54]. the
mtorc1 complex is sensitive to rapamycin and includes
the adaptor protein raptor. it is involved, downstream of
pkb, in the anabolic effect of insulin through activation
of  xxxg1989xxx /2 and inhibition of  xxxg693xxx  and 4e-bp2 ( xxxg692xxx  binding protein).
pkb-induced phosphorylation and destabilisation of
the  xxxg2337xxx / xxxg2338xxx  (tuberous sclerosis) complex is necessary for mtorc1 activation [53]. the next paragraph and
figure 2 summarize the evidences about an important
role of abnormal activation of mtorc1/ xxxg1989xxx  pathway in
insulin resistance.
in obesity and diabetes, mtorc1/ xxxg1989xxx  signaling is
chronically activated [55] and cellular studies have shown
that this chronic activation promotes insulin resistance by
a negative feedback mechanism involving serine phosphorylation and degradation of  xxxg1198xxx  as well as inhibition
of  xxxg1198xxx  transcription [56,57] (figure 2). recently, overactivation of mtorc1 has been linked to the development of endoplasmic reticulum stress [58], a known
activator of jnk pathway [32], raising the possibility that
mtorc1/ xxxg1989xxx  and jnk pathways might cooperate in
obesity and diabetes to disrupt insulin action (figure 2). a
connection between inflammation-induced insulin resistance and activation of mtorc1 was also recently discovered. indeed,  xxxg1159xxx  destabilizes the  xxxg2337xxx /2 complex,
www.sciencedirect.com

cellular mechanisms of insulin resistance tanti and jager 759

thus activating mtorc1 [59]. this mechanism could
contribute to  xxxg2296xxx -induced insulin resistance through
 xxxg1989xxx -induced  xxxg1198xxx  serine phosphorylation [19,20]
(figure 2). in hepatocytes, il-6 activates mtor leading
to the upregulation of socs3 [60] a known inhibitor of
insulin signaling that decreases ir/ xxxg1198xxx  interaction and/
or increases  xxxg1198xxx  degradation [61] (figure 2).
several genetically modified mice have been engineered
to study the implication of mtorc1 in the regulation of
insulin sensitivity (table 1). full-body  xxxg1989xxx  knockout
mice are protected against obesity and insulin resistance
owing to elevated energy expenditure and the loss of
 xxxg1198xxx  serine phosphorylation by  xxxg1989xxx  [62,63]. conversely, global invalidation of  xxxg693xxx  and 4e-bp2 leads to
the opposite phenotype [64]. interestingly, mice with
adipose-specific raptor invalidation mainly recapitulate
the phenotype of  xxxg1989xxx  knockout mice [65]. thus, these
studies point up adipose mtorc1 as an important
regulator of adipose tissue metabolism, insulin sensitivity,
and whole-body energy homeostasis [65]. in addition,
mtorc1 also plays an important role in liver insulin
resistance. indeed, hepatic overexpression of a dominant
negative truncated form of raptor reduces liver  xxxg1989xxx 
activity and improves glucose tolerance of obese mice
[66]. furthermore, hypothalamic overactivation of
mtorc1/ xxxg1989xxx  signaling by hfd blunts both hypothalamic insulin signaling and the ability of hypothalamic
insulin to suppress hepatic glucose production [67].
given the important role of the alteration of the mtorc1/
 xxxg1989xxx  signaling in insulin resistance, some studies have
tested whether rapamycin could improve insulin action
in vivo. however, except in one study [68], rapamycin does
not improve insulin resistance [69,70]. apart from species
differences, one possible explanation is that rapamycin
blunts the pancreatic b-cells adaptation to insulin resistance because mtorc1 activity is necessary for b-cells
mass expansion [71,72]. also, long-term treatment with
rapamycin may have detrimental effects on muscles function as suggested by the dystrophic phenotype of musclespecific raptor deficient mice [73]. thus, mtorc1 inhibition by rapamycin does not seem to be a valuable strategy
to reverse defects in insulin action in vivo.

conclusion
in obesity and diabetes, abnormal regulation of insulin
signaling is an important factor in the development of
insulin resistance. irs serine phosphorylation is a timecontrolled physiological feedback mechanism in insulin
signaling that has been hijacked by metabolic and inflammatory stresses to promote insulin resistance. several
kinases including  xxxg1159xxx , jnk, erk, mtor, and  xxxg1989xxx 
are activated by these inducers of insulin resistance and
phosphorylate irs proteins on several serine residues in
an uncontrolled manner. of note, in addition to interfere
with insulin signaling, we recently propose that these
www.sciencedirect.com

stresses can promote insulin resistance by targeting
proteins involved in glucose transporter trafficking [74].
studies of genetically modified mice have uncovered an
important role of these kinases in the control of insulin
sensitivity and whole-body metabolism (table 1). these
kinases integrate signals from metabolic and inflammatory stresses mainly in adipose tissue, liver, and hypothalamus leading to both peripheral and central insulin
resistance. in these tissues, they may operate in a coordinated manner that enhances their deleterious effects
(figure 2). moreover, in addition to be mediators of the
inducers of insulin resistance, activation of  xxxg1159xxx  and
 xxxg1370xxx  in myeloid cells contribute to the production of
inflammatory cytokines induced by overnutrition.
these kinases are thus potential drug targets to fight
insulin resistance and some studies suggest that therapy
targeting the  xxxg1159xxx / xxxg1559xxx  or the jnk pathway may
evolve into future diabetes medication. however, the drug
discovery process is still at the preclinical stage for jnk
inhibitors. the clinical trials for  xxxg1159xxx  have led to promising results but the number of subjects was a few and the
duration of treatment was short and side effects may appear
with longer treatment. furthermore, all these kinases are
involved in the control of several biologic processes and
this can be problematic for the development of safe drugs
for the treatment of a chronic disease. identification of
upstream regulators or downstream substrates of these
kinases activated specifically in response to metabolic or
inflammatory stresses could be a strategy to circumvent this
problem. future studies should tell us whether the targeting of these serine kinases or their regulators will evolve
into the development of new therapeutic agents against
insulin resistance and diabetes.

involvement of tnf-alpha in abnormal adipocyte and muscle
sortilin expression in obese mice and humans. diabetologia
2009, 52:932-940.
this study demonstrates that sortilin expression is decreased in obesity
and uncovers  xxxg2296xxx  as an important negative regulator of its expression. it
demonstrates that inflammatory stress might target proteins involved in
glucose transporter trafficking in addition to insulin signaling.
