introduction
o-arabinosyl

nucleosides such as ara-c3 or ara-a have been

under studies as strong carcinostatic and antiviral agents. it is
now evident that the active forms of these compounds are aractp and  xxxd83xxx  which strongly inhibit dna polymerases (5,
7, 8, 10, 15-17, 23-25).
ara-g was synthesized by reist and goodman (19). in con
 xxxd2969xxx  to  xxxd1790xxx  or ara-a, it did not show any remarkable antitumor
activity (2). it was also observed that ara-t had no effect on
cell growth (1, 9). however, as demonstrated in our previous
report (13), ara-t became a strong inhibitor of dna polymer
ases when converted to the phosphorylated form ara-ttp. this
observation prompted us to examine the effect of ara-gtp on
in vitro dna synthesis.
in this study, we compared the inhibitory effects of ara-gtp
and  xxxd83xxx  on the activities of purified murine cellular dna
polymerases a, ãÿ,and y and oncornaviral dna polymerase.
results showed that ara-gtp was a potent inhibitor of all the
dna polymerases tested. thus, we have now evaluated the

30 to 40% inhibition was observed throughout the reaction
period. furthermore, when 5 â¡j.m
ara-gtp were added and
 xxxd1837xxx  was omitted, only 0.3 pmol of [3h]dcmp was incorpo
rated in 30 min. this value was much less than that of the
complete system and less than that observed when neither
 xxxd1837xxx  nor ara-gtp was added (0.9 pmol). these results indi
cate that ara-gtp was not effective in place of  xxxd1837xxx  as a
substrate for dna polymerase a.  xxxd83xxx  also could not sub
stitute for  xxxd1148xxx  with any of the dna polymerases examined
(data not shown). similar results showing that ara-gtp could
not substitute for  xxxd1837xxx  were obtained with dna polymerases
ãÿand y (chart 1, ãÿand c). however, slight substitution of aragtp for  xxxd1837xxx  was observed with rlv dna polymerase.

both ara-gtp and  xxxd83xxx  strongly inhibited the polymeri

(dt)n.(ra),2_20, or (dt)n.(da)12.l8 ([3h]damp).
results showed that a relatively low concentration of aragtp or  xxxd83xxx  was enough to inhibit the incorporation of
deoxyribonucleotide
with the same base as the inhibitor, es
pecially when synthetic polynucleotides were used as template
primers.
analysis of mode of inhibition and determination of kinetic
constants. the activity of dma polymerase which had been
preincubated with an inhibitor was restored by the addition of
excess substrate(s) (data not shown). since this indicates that
the inhibitor was bound to the enzyme reversibly, the inhibition
was analyzed kinetically. typical results on dna polymerases
a and ãÿare shown in charts 6 to 8.

inhibition of dna polymerase a by ara-gtp was examined
with activated calf thymus dna and [3h] xxxd1837xxx  (chart 6a) or
[3h] xxxd1148xxx  (chart 7a). as seen from the double reciprocal plot
(chart 60), the km for  xxxd1837xxx  was 2.9 fim, and the mode of
inhibition by ara-gtp was competitive with  xxxd1837xxx . the k, of
ara-gtp for dna polymerase <*was determined to be 0.5 /im
from a dixon plot. the competition between ara-gtp and  xxxd1837xxx 
indicates that both nucleotides bind to the same active site of
dna polymerase â«.on the contrary, ara-gtp inhibited the
incorporation of the labeled  xxxd1148xxx  noncompetitively (chart 7b),
and the k, for ara-gtp was 20 um, which was much higher than
the km for  xxxd1148xxx  (1.0 jim). these results indicate that ara-gtp
binds to a different binding-site(s) from  xxxd1148xxx . ara-gtp caused
a mixed type inhibition of dna polymerase ãÿwith activated
dna and  xxxd1837xxx  (chart 8b), and the k, for ara-gtp (15 jum;
chart 8c) was also lower than the km for  xxxd1837xxx  (28.6 jum).
summary of effects of ara-gtp and  xxxd83xxx  on mouse
cellular and viral dna polymerases. the km's, k.'s, and
modes of inhibition of all the compounds tested are summarized
in table 2. all the dna polymerase activities, measured by
following incorporation of [3h]dgmp, were inhibited competi
tively (competitive type inhibition) or partially competitively
(mixed type inhibition) by ara-gtp. furthermore, except for
dna polymerase y with activated calf thymus dna and with
(dc)n-(dg)t2-i8, the k,'s for ara-gtp were much lower than

the ratio of the kâ¡to the km indicates the relative affinities of

(22). from these values, ara-gtp appears to be as effective an
inhibitor as  xxxd83xxx .
in some cases, such as with dna polymerases a and ãÿwith
activated calf thymus dna, a relatively high concentration of

ara-gtp inhibited the incorporation of  xxxd1148xxx , and the mode of
inhibition was noncompetitive. these results suggest the pres

discussion
ara-g was found to be rather ineffective in preventing the
growth of ascites tumors, and it did not increase the survival of

mice bearing ta3 ascites cells (2). however, it was demon
strated to have antiviral activity in mice inoculated with vaccinia
or herpes simplex type i virus (6).
during our studies on dna polymerase inhibitors, we found
that ara-ttp was a strong inhibitor for mammalian and oncornaviral dna polymerases (13), although ara-t did not inhibit
dna synthesis of intact mammalian cells (1, 9). on the basis of
this finding, we examined the effect of ara-g with a combination
of ara-gtp and purified dna polymerases. ara-gtp was syn
thesized from 9-/8-d-arabinofuranosyladenine
5'-monophosphate via ara-gmp (21). this work shows that this ara-gtp is
a potent inhibitor of all the dna polymerases tested. thus, we
conclude that all 4 kinds of d-arabinosyl nucleoside (ara-a,
 xxxd1790xxx , ara-g, and ara-t) can inhibit dna synthesis when they
are converted to their triphosphates.
the finding that ara-gtp was not effective in place of  xxxd1837xxx 
in polymerization reactions by dna polymerases a, ãÿ,and y
(chart 1, a to c) indicates that these enzymes did not readily
utilize ara-gtp as substrate for dna synthesis. consistent with
this, it has been shown that  xxxd83xxx  is not an effective sub
strate for dna polymerase of lymphosarcoma (7) and that aractp is not effective for dna polymerase from calf thymus (8).
ara-gtp did not inhibit the incorporation of [3h]dcmp with rlv
dna polymerase in reaction mixture from which  xxxd1837xxx  was
omitted, but in fact slightly stimulated the reaction (chart 1d).
this result might be explained by supposing that ara-gtp
instead of  xxxd1837xxx  is incorporated into the dna chain. however,
the results in chart 5 indicate that the incorporation of [3h]dgmp with activated dna was also stimulated by ara-gtp,
indicating that [3h] xxxd1837xxx  was not diluted with "cold" ara-gtp,
that is, ara-gtp was not used as a substrate for this enzyme.
therefore, it is likely that the stimulation observed with aragtp (charts 1d and 5) was the result of activation of the
november

enzyme by some unknown mechanism.
ara-gtp, like  xxxd83xxx , was a strong inhibitor for all the dna
polymerases tested. dna polymerase a was more sensitive
than were dna polymerases ãÿand y or viral dna polymerase
to inhibition by ara-gtp. dna polymerase a was also very
sensitive to ara-ctp, whereas polymerase ãÿwas almost com
pletely resistant to this compound (23, 25). on the contrary,
dicioccio and srivastava (5) reported similar values for the
inhibition constants for ara-ctp or  xxxd83xxx  of dna polymer
ases a and ãÿfrom 5 types of normal and leukemic human cells.
they did not test the inhibition of dna polymerase y activity by
ara-ctp or  xxxd83xxx  (5). mã¼lleret al. (16) found that  xxxd83xxx 
was most inhibitory to dna polymerase ãÿand slightly less
inhibitory to dna polymerase a (16). our results show that
dna polymerases y and â«are much more sensitive to  xxxd83xxx 
than is dna polymerase ãÿand that the k, for  xxxd83xxx  depended
greatly on the template primer. the discrepancies between
results on the inhibitory effects of arabinosylnucleotides
re
ported by other authors may reflect actual differences between
the enzymes from different sources, as discussed previously
(5) or may be due to the different assay conditions used.
three types of inhibition were observed on changing the
combination of enzyme, template primer, and labeled deoxynucleotide. usually, the inhibition by ara-gtp was competitive
with  xxxd1837xxx , but in some cases it was mixed type (dna polym
erase ãÿ).mixed-type inhibition was also observed with  xxxd83xxx 
in the combination of dna polymerase a and (dt)n-(ra)12_2o or
(dt)n-(da)12_i8 (table 2). this type of inhibition was not found
in experiments with ara-ctp and ara-ttp (13). the results
suggest that the mechanism of recognition of purine nucleotides by the dna polymerases is different from that of recog
nition of pyrimidine nucleotides, ara-gtp and  xxxd83xxx  both
cause noncompetitive inhibition of the incorporation of a de-

oxynucleotide substrate that has a different base. the pres
ence of a binding site for arabinosylnucleotide
inhibitor other
than that for the substrate was deduced from studies with arattp and ara-ctp (13), and we confirmed this with ara-gtp
and  xxxd83xxx  in the present work.
results concerning the incorporation of arabinosylnucleotide
into dma have been well reviewed and discussed previously
(4, 8). it is clear that arabinosyl compounds can be incorpo
rated into dma in both in vitro and in vivo reactions. although
our finding that ara-gtp did not substitute readily for  xxxd1837xxx 
suggests that it is not effective as a substrate, results on its
inhibitory effect may reflect any one of the following possibili
ties: (a) ara-gtp may be very slowly incorporated into the dna
chain; (b) ara-gtp may inhibit addition of the next nucleotide
(chain elongation); or (c) ara-gtp may be a chain terminator.
since the incorporation of ara-gtp into dna has not yet been
examined, these possibilities still remain to be examined. how
ever, very slight incorporation of arabinosyl compounds, if any
(8), cannot explain the strong inhibitions of these compounds
on dna synthesis in vitro. our results indicate that the incor
poration of arabinosyl compounds into growing dna chains is
not the major mechanism of the inhibition of dna synthesis and
that the inhibition is mainly due to competiton between the
substrate and inhibitor for the same binding site(s) on the
enzyme molecule.
