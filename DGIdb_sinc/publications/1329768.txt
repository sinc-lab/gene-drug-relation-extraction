abstract-the effects of diltiazem, verapamil,  xxxd318xxx ,  xxxd2718xxx  and nifedipine were studied in oitro
on na+,k+-atpase from dog kidney ( xxxg225xxx   xxxg265xxx   xxxg441xxx   xxxg621xxx   xxxg725xxx   xxxg726xxx   xxxg1213xxx   xxxg2173xxx   xxxg2174xxx   xxxg2428xxx .37). except diltiazem, all the drugs tested showed an
inhibitory effect on na+,k+-atpase activity in a dose-dependent manner. among these drugs  xxxd318xxx 
is far more effective than the others (1~~~ = lo-” m). competition studies showed that  xxxd318xxx  acted
in a non-competitive manner with the atp-me complex and in a partially competitive manner with
k+. since ouabain acted similarly under the same experimental conditions, we tested the interaction
of  xxxd318xxx  and ouabain on na+,k+-a’ltase. with low doses of ouabain, the enzyme inhibition
corresponded to a potentiated synergy of the two drugs. we then studied the action of  xxxd318xxx  on the
sodium pump activity of intact red blood cells by an ed uivo microcalorimetric technique. at 10m5
m
 xxxd318xxx  caused a significant decrease in sodium pump activity (33 2 8%).

classically, calcium antagonist (ca?) drugs act by
blocking calcium entry through slow calcium
channels, thus leading to a decoupling between
excitation and contraction. among the side-effects
of these drugs, hydro-electrolytic
disorders have
been described; particularly a natriuretic effect [l31. the cellular mechanism of this action is not yet
entirely elucidated [4,5] but a perturbation of the
atp-dependent ion pumps has been evoked. studies
performed to test the hypothesis have shown
discordant
results.
findings
showed either a
stimulation or no effect on na+,k+-atpase [6-8].
in the case of  xxxd318xxx , action on ca2+-atpase has
been proved [9] but no study on the sodium pump
has been performed.
the aim of the present study was to evaluate the
effect of some cas and particularly  xxxd318xxx  on
na+,k+-atpase by using an in vitro technique and
an ex vivo microcalorimetric method. we chose one
ca molecule among each of the classical clinical
classes of these drugs [lo]: drugs with predominantly
vascular effects such as dihydropyridines, drugs with
predominantly cardiac effects such as verapamil and
diltiazem, and drugs with a complex pharmacological
profile such as  xxxd318xxx .

microcalorimetric assay
preparation of red blood cells (rbcs). venous
blood (30 ml) from six healthy subjects was collected
in sodium heparin tubes. after centrifugation
at
600g for lomin,
plasma was collected and
recentrifuged for 10 min at 2000g to yield clear
plasma. blood cells were resuspended in 0.9%
 xxxd3213xxx  solution and passed through a
column packed with a mixture of (ycellulose and
microcrystalline cellulose (50 : 50 w/w) to separate
rbcs from leukocytes and platelets, according to
beutler’s method [12]. rbcs were then packed by
centrifugation at 2000g for 10 min, and 0.5 ml of
the rbc pellet for each healthy subject was
resuspended in 3.6 ml of the subject’s own cleared
plasma. hematocrit value, and counts of leukocytes
and platelets were determined on aliquots with a
technicon hl system apparatus.
microcalorimetry. we used an lkb flow bioactivity monitor 2277 microcalorimeter thermostated
at 37”. thermograms were recorded at a chart speed
of 10 cm/hr and at a sensitivity of 30 pw full-scale.
baseline was obtained with subject’s own plasma
pumped through the microcalorimetric cell at a flow
rate of 36 ml/hr. the thermogram was then recorded
by pumping, at the same rate, 3.5 ml of rbc

suspension preincubated
at 37“ for 60 min. the
steady state in heat production (hp) was reached
by continuous pumping in closed circuit (v = 3 ml),
then ouabain solution was added at a flow rate of
1 ml/hr for 6 min (finalconcentration0.4
x 10m3m).
for  xxxd318xxx  assays, drug was preincubated with
rbc suspension for 60 min at 37” and the same
experiment was carried out.

(0.1 and 0.2 mm) in the presence of increasing atp
concentrations (0.3-3 mm). the [atp]/[mgz+] ratio
remained constant in all experiments ([atp]/[mgz’]
= 6.7). there is a common intersection on the xaxis, showing that the affinity of the atp-mgz+
complex for the enzyme is not modified in the
presence of  xxxd318xxx .

that the two drugs act in a potentiated synergistic
manner. for example, with 0.5 pm ouabain, 46 &i
 xxxd318xxx  would be necessary to obtain 40% inhibition
in the case of an additive effect. as can be seen in
fig. 5, only 25 pm bepridii leads to the same
inhibition. for all the above experiments each result

microcalorimetric assay
figure 6 shows a typical recording of hp without
(a) and with (b)  xxxd318xxx  (10e5m). the difference
between steady-states obtained before and after
ouabain addition corresponds to the sodium pump
activity (ahp) which is expressed as mw/l rbcs
[14]. from these recordings we measured the action
of two doses of  xxxd318xxx  on the sodium pump
(table 1). the methodological
error(s) in ahp
determination was calculated from the expression
[14]:

s = (zd2/2n)‘/*
where d is the difference between two calorimetric
determinations on the same rbc subject and n is
the total number of subjects studied. under our
experimental conditions, s = 1 mw/l rbcs.
discussion

the ca drugs we studied exerted various
effects on isolated na+,k+-atpase activity in the
concentration range tested. among the ca tested,
the effect on na+,k+-atpase seems to be related
to clinical classification. drugs with predominantly
cardiac effects exerted no inhibitory action (diltiazem) or did so at very high concentration ranges
(verapamil : inhibition 50% > 10d3 m). drugs with a
complex pharmacological profile like  xxxd318xxx  were
more effective than the other drugs (& = lo4 m-l).
our results agree with those of others since
 xxxd2125xxx , which is also in this group, was reported

to inhibit na+,k+-atpase from the cerebral cortex
in the same dose/effect ratio [8]. finally, among
drugs with predominantly vascular effects such as
dihydropyridines,
 xxxd2718xxx  seems to act in a
concentration range intermediate between the two
other classes. nifedipine had the same behavior as
 xxxd2718xxx  up to 10e4 m but because of its poor
solubility it was impossible for us to study it under
our experimental conditions at concentrations higher
than 10e4m. as  xxxd318xxx  exerted the most potent
effect, we sought to specify some points about its
mechanism of action. competition between  xxxd318xxx 
and the atp-mg*+ corn lex (fig. 2) was performed
with a constant [atp] p[mp*+] ratio leading to a
concomitant change in free mg*+ concentration.
consequently, the effect observed might be due at
least in part to this change. indeed,
high
concentrations
of free mg*+ partially inactivate
na+,k+-atpase as shown by cantley and josephson
[15]. however, under our experimental conditions
the inhibitory effect due to free mg*+ would remain
constant as calculated from cantley and josephson’s
results. therefore, in our experiment the change in
free mg*+ concentration intervened but in a constant
manner. under these conditions, we can assert that
 xxxd318xxx  acts in a non-competitive manner with the

sodium pump inhibition by  xxxd318xxx 

atp-mg*+ complex since the curve intersects on
the x-axis. the graphs in fig. 3 show, for  xxxd318xxx 
and ouabain, an intersection corresponding to a
partially competitive inhibition with k+. for ouabain
such a result has been obtained previously [16,17].
thus, it seems that  xxxd318xxx  acts like this cardiac
glycoside on na+,k+-atpase. for the same effect,
the concentrations
of  xxxd318xxx  were about loofold higher than those of ouabain
(ouabain
 xxxd318xxx 
lcso = 1o-4 m),
lcso = 1.4 x lo+ m,
reflecting a lesser affinity of  xxxd318xxx  for na+,k+atpase .
these results led us to study the possibility of an
interaction of these drugs. such an interaction is
evidenced by the results shown in fig. 4. lcso for
ouabain was significantly lower in the presence
of  xxxd318xxx .
it decreased
from 1.4 x 10e6 to
1.2 x 10e6 m, and then to 0.4 x low6 m for  xxxd318xxx 
concentrations equal to 0, 4 x 10m6and 4 x 10m5m,
respectively. moreover, for the above concentrations
the percentages of inhibition observed with the
mixture of the drugs were higher than those obtained
with the mere addition of the effects of each drug
taken separately, thus suggesting a potentiated
synergistic inhibitory effect. this was confirmed by
the curve in fig. 5 which shows a potentiated synergy
(see results). however, it seems that this is an
indirect synergy since the potentiation disappears at
high ouabain doses; for instance, with  xxxd318xxx  =
4 x 10e5 m the synergy disappears for concentrations
of ouabain greater than 2 x 10m6m. it is possible
that, at high enough concentrations,
ouabain
displaces  xxxd318xxx  from its action site.
in vitro measurements of na+,k+-atpase inhibition are often not sufficiently indicative of
sodium pump inhibition in the intact cell [18].
microcalorimetry permits measurements of sodium
pump activity in living rbcs [19,20].  xxxd318xxx 
induced a significant dose-dependent
decrease in
sodium pump activity. this result obtained on living
cells is in agreement with the above in vitro findings.
however, in our experiments, living rbcs were
incubated with  xxxd318xxx  before measurements were
taken, which may explain why  xxxd318xxx  is much more
effective on living cells than in in vitro experiments.
the concentrations
used were higher than those
observed in plasma from patients treated with the
drugs (= 10m6m) but, as proved by cramb and dow
[21] for isolated ventricular myocytes incubated with
 xxxd318xxx , the drug is concentrated loo-fold within
the cell. it is always difficult to correlate in oitro
results with an effect observed in uiuo, but the
concentrations we used to demonstrate the effect of
 xxxd318xxx  on the sodium pump are in the range of
those observed in myocytes. therefore,
if our in
vitro results also occur in vivo, a pharmacological
effect similar to those of digitalic drugs should be
observed, which is not the case except for the
negative chronotropic effect (221. the explanation
for this discrepancy may be found in the inhibition
of na+,ca*+ counter transport by  xxxd318xxx  [23] and
in the high affinity sites for the drug in the membranes
of myocytes and within them [21,24]. such an
affinity would hinder the binding of  xxxd318xxx  with
na+,k+-atpase
(& = lo4 m-l) thus explaining why

1533

 xxxd318xxx  did not show a more marked ouabain-like
action.
