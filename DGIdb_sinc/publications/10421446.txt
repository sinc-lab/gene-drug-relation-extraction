abstract
we examined the role of  xxxd1968xxx  in the acceleration phenomenon using mouse
wild-type and mutant d74n ache inhibited with 7-(o,o-diethyl-phosphinyloxy)-1-methylquinolinium methylsulfate (depq). with depq-inhibited wild-type mouse acetylcholinesterase (ache), the reactivation kinetic profile demonstrated one-phase exponential
association only when 2-[hydroxyimino methyl]-1-methylpyridinium chloride (2-pam) and
1-(2-hydroxy-iminomethyl-1-pyridinium)-1-(4-carboxy-aminopyridinium)-dimethyl ether hydrochloride (hi-6) were used as reactivators. when 1,1[oxybis-methylene)bis[4-(hydroxyimino)methyl] pyridinium dichloride (lüh6) and 1,1-trimethylene bis(4-hydroxyimino
methyl) pyridinium dichloride (tmb4) were used, the reactivation kinetic profile was
biphasic in nature.  xxxd1968xxx  had no effect on reactivation by 2-pam and hi-6, but
significantly accelerated lüh6- and tmb4-induced reactivation of depq-inhibited wildtype mouse ache. comparison of the initial and overall reactivation rate constants with five

abbre6iations: ache, acetylcholinesterase; depq, 7-(o,o-diethyl-phosphinyloxy)-1-methyl-quinolinium methylsulfate; hi-6, 1-(2-hydroxy-iminomethyl-1-pyridinium)-1-(4-carboxy-aminopyridinium)dimethyl ether hydrochloride; lüh6 (toxogonin), 1,1[oxybis-methylene)bis[4-(hydroxyimino)methyl]

oximes indicated that acceleration by  xxxd1968xxx  may be due to the prevention of
re-inhibition of the reactivated enzyme by the phosphorylated oxime (pox) produced during
the reactivation. with lüh6 and tmb4, about 2.5-fold increase in the reactivation rate
constants was observed in the presence of  xxxd1968xxx , but little or no effect was observed
with the other three oximes. the initial reactivation rate constants were 5.4- and 4.2-fold of
the overall rate constants with lüh6 and tmb4 as reactivators respectively, however, very
little change was found between the initial and overall rate constants with the other three
oximes. in experiments with d74n ache, for which the inhibition potency of charged
organophosphate (op) was two to three orders less than wild-type enzyme,  xxxd1968xxx 
had no effect on the reactivation by lüh6 and tmb4 and the time courses of reactivation
were monophasic. the data from mutant enzyme substantiate the involvement of  xxxd1968xxx  in protecting pox re-inhibition of reactivated enzyme formed during the reactivation
of op-inhibited ache. © 1999 elsevier science ireland ltd. all rights reserved.

reactivation

inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (ache;  xxxg38xxx ) by organophosphorus (op)
esters is attributed to the acute toxicity of these compounds. reactivation of the
op-inhibited enzyme by certain nucleophiles, such as oxime 2-[hydroxyimino
methy]-1-methylpyridinium chloride (2-pam), has proven to be an efficient way to
attenuate the toxicity. to improve the reactivation property of the leading compounds, numerous investigations have attempted to delineate the interactions
between the op-enzyme conjugates and the reactivators [1–3]. however, the
structure – function relationship between oximes and ops is not clearly understood.
moreover, certain ligands, such as  xxxd1820xxx  and sad-128, were shown to
induce acceleration of oxime-induced reactivation [4]. in an effort to elucidate the
mechanism of ligand-induced acceleration of reactivation, we previously showed
that  xxxd1968xxx  and  xxxd1820xxx  could accelerate the oxime-induced reactivation of mepq-inhibited fetal bovine serum ache. the peripheral ligand  xxxd3027xxx  slowed the reactivation process with all the tested oximes. however,
reactivation of the enzyme conjugate by 1-(2-hydroxy-iminomethyl-1-pyridinium)-1(4-carboxy-aminopyridinium)-dimethyl ether hydrochloride (hi-6) and its analogues was not affected by these two ligands [5]. two possible mechanisms were
proposed to explain the acceleration by these ligands: (i) the ligands may induce a
conformational change in the enzyme-op conjugate making the op residue more
susceptible to nucleophilic attack by the oxime; and (ii) the added ligands may
prevent the re-inhibition of the reactivated enzyme by the putative phosphorylated
oxime (pox) by forming a complex with the reactivated enzyme. the latter was
indicated since acceleration by  xxxd1968xxx  was observed only with those oximes
with which reduced reactivation of the higher enzyme conjugate concentration was
demonstrated. in the present study we have further investigated the mechanism of
 xxxd1968xxx -induced acceleration of reactivation by using 7-(o,o-diethyl-phosphinyloxy)-1-methyl-quinolinium methylsulfate (depq)-inhibited mouse wild-type

and mutant d74n ache. results further support the mechanism that the added
ligand formed a reversible complex with the reactivated enzyme, thereby preventing
the re-inhibition by pox.
in the previous study with mepq-inhibited fetal bovine serum ache, we
showed that of the three quaternary ligands tested,  xxxd1968xxx  was the most
effective in accelerating oxime-induced reactivation. examination of the dependence
of reactivation on the enzyme – conjugate concentration suggested that these ligands
may accelerate the oxime-induced reactivation by preventing pox re-inhibition of
the reactivated enzyme. due to the presence of a chiral center in mepq, two
species of mepq – ache conjugate were formed which differed in their reactivation
properties, and it was necessary to use a two-component model to fit the kinetic
data. in the present study we used depq which forms one enzyme conjugate. this
simplified the kinetic analysis and made it easier to recognize other factors involved
in the reactivation process. the reactivation of depq-inhibited ache was expected to follow one-phase exponential association. however, this was the case only
with hi-6 and 2-pam. when 1,1[oxybis-methylene)bis[4-(hydroxyimino)methyl]
pyridinium dichloride (lüh6) and 1,1-trimethylene bis(4-hydroxyimino methyl)
pyridinium dibromide (tmb4) were used, the reactivation after the initial stage was

50 mm phosphate buffer, ph 8.0 with enzyme conjugate concentration of 1.25 nm. data were
representative of three to four experiments and fitted to one-phase exponential equation.

significantly lower than the theoretical value predicted by the kinetic model (fig. 1).
these results indicated that when lüh6 and tmb4 were used as reactivators, the
putative poxs might be formed during the reactivation and cause re-inhibition of
the reactivated enzyme. acceleration of reactivation by  xxxd1968xxx  was observed
only with lüh6 and tmb4, which is in agreement with the pox re-inhibition
theory, since  xxxd1968xxx  is a reversible inhibitor of the enzyme and can protect
the reactivated enzyme from re-inhibition by these poxs.
poxs were implicated previously by several investigators to be able to cause
re-inhibition of the reactivated enzyme [6,7]. however, no direct proof has been
found up to now to show the formation of pox in the reactivation media. since the
concentration of depq-enzyme conjugate was about 0.2 nm in the determination
of initial reactivation rate constants, the amount of pox formed by reaction of
oximes with depq – ache conjugate should be negligible at the initial stage of
reactivation. therefore, the initial reactivation rate constants should not be affected
by poxs. the initial rate constants were obtained by using the continuous
monitoring method, and results showed that within 4 min enough data were
collected to fit to the equation for the initial constants (40 data points, fig. 2).
comparison of the initial and overall reactivation rate constants in fig. 3 showed

133

a 5.4- and 4.2-fold reduction in the overall rate constants with lüh6 and tmb4,
respectively. at the same time, pronounced acceleration by  xxxd1968xxx  (about
2.5-fold increase in the overall reactivation rate constants) was observed with these
two oximes only. these results clearly showed the possibility of pox re-inhibition
and  xxxd1968xxx  protection of the reactivated enzyme. when 2-pam or hi-6 were
used as reactivators, no pox re-inhibition was indicated since the initial and overall
reactivation rate constants were in good agreement, and  xxxd1968xxx  had no effect
on the reactivation. with mmb4 a marginal pox re-inhibition and  xxxd1968xxx 
acceleration were observed (figs. 1 and 3). comparison of initial and overall rate
constants of reactivation showed that protection of the reactivated enzyme by
 xxxd1968xxx  contributed to its acceleration effect.
a recent study by hosea et al. [8] showed that the aspartate 74 ( xxxd74xxx ) in ache
was the main determinant of the specificity for charged op. when this amino acid
was mutated to asparagine, the mutant enzyme d74n ache was two to three
orders of magnitude less sensitive to inhibition by charged ops than wild-type
enzyme. pox is also a charged op compound. if the same amount of pox was
formed during the reactivation, the re-inhibition by pox should be much less
pronounced with d74n ache than with wild-type enzyme. therefore, the reactivation of depq-inhibited d74n ache by lüh6 and tmb4 was tested at the same
conjugate concentration (1.25 nm), and  xxxd1968xxx  had no effect on the reactivation of the mutant enzyme-op conjugate. also, the time course of reactivation by
the two oximes followed one-phase exponential association, suggesting that no
pox re-inhibition occurred with the mutant enzyme (fig. 4). the data from mutant
enzyme substantiate the involvement of  xxxd1968xxx  in preventing pox re-inhibition during the reactivation of op-inhibited ache.

constant; (kobs-o)e is the overall rate constant in the presence of 10 mm  xxxd1968xxx . each constant was
the mean value of three to five independent determinations, r =0.9749.

fig. 4. reactivation of depq-inhibited d74n ache by oximes with (circle) and without (square) 10
mm  xxxd1968xxx . about 90% inhibition was obtained by incubating the mutant enzyme with excess
depq at ph 8.0 for 60 min at 25°. the excess depq was removed by dialysis at 4° overnight.
reactivation was carried out at 25°, ph 8.0, with enzyme conjugate concentration of 1.25 nm. data
were representative of two parallel experiments and fitted to one-phase exponential equation.

these studies suggest that the acceleration of oxime-induced reactivation of
op-inhibited ache by  xxxd1968xxx  results from the prevention of pox re-inhibition of reactivated enzyme. it seems that pox re-inhibition during reactivation
largely depends on the structure of the oximes and the ops used. with oximes like
hi-6 and its analogues, no re-inhibition was observed with mepq- or depq-enzyme conjugates. with 2-pam re-inhibition was observed only with mepq-enzyme
conjugate. with lüh6 and tmb4 re-inhibition by pox was found with both
enzyme conjugates. the reason for the variations of pox re-inhibition may be due
to stability of the pox in reactivation media. when the pox formed in the media
breaks down rapidly, the reactivation process continues. if the pox formed is
stable, it will inhibit the reactivated enzyme and slow down the reactivation process.
further study of this phenomenon is essential for understanding the behavior of
different oximes in the reactivation of different enzyme-op conjugates.
