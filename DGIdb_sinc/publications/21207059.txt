abstract hyperammonemia occurs mainly in patients with
branched-chain organic acidemias such as propionic, methylmalonic, and isovaleric acidemias. its pathophysiological
process is mainly via the competitive inhibition of nacetylglutamate synthetase. oral  xxxd442xxx  ( xxxd442xxx ) administration can correct hyperammonemia
in neonates with propionic and methylmalonic acidemias,
thus avoiding dialysis therapy. isovaleric acidemia is an
autosomal recessive disease of leucine metabolism due to
deficiency of  xxxg1216xxx . for the first
time, we report a neonate with isovaleric acidemia, whose
plasma ammonia concentration dropped dramatically after
one oral load of  xxxd442xxx . this experience suggests
that  xxxd442xxx  could be considered for acute hyperammonemia resulting from isovaleric acidemia. however,
trials with more patients are needed.

introduction
isovaleric acidemia (iva, omim #243500) is an autosomal
recessively inherited organic acidemia caused by deficiency
of the mitochondrial enzyme  xxxg1216xxx  ( xxxg1216xxx , e.c. 1.3.99.10). it is a defect in the catabolism of
leucine, resulting in the accumulation of derivatives of

isovaleryl-coa. early diagnosis and treatment with a
protein-restricted diet and supplementation with carnitine
and glycine are effective in promoting normal development
in severely affected individuals [1]. two phenotypes have
been reported: an acute neonatal and a chronic intermittent
presentation. patients with the acute form become symptomatic within the first 2 weeks after birth (poor feeding,
vomiting, decreased consciousness, seizures). the second
group presents with nonspecific symptoms such as failure to
thrive or developmental delay. both groups of patients are
prone to intermittent acute episodes of decompensation with
minor illnesses. neonates appear initially well then develop
nonspecific symptoms which include poor feeding, vomiting,
decreased level of consciousness, and seizures [2].
in iva, hyperammonemia as a symptom of metabolic
decompensation is one of the major clinical problems which
constitutes a severe insult to the developing infantile brain.
secondary hyperammonemia can occur in iva and is due to
competitive inhibition of n-acetylglutamate synthetase
(nags,  xxxg1500xxx ) by isovaleryl-coa and/or intracellular
depletion of acetyl-coa, leading to reduced n-acetylglutamate synthesis and impairment of the urea cycle. hyperammonemia is a neonatal emergency requiring rapid and
vigorous treatment.  xxxd442xxx  (ngg) is a
structural analog of n-acetylglutamate, licensed as an orphan
drug for the treatment of hyperammonemia due to nags
deficiency. we report on a full-term neonate with iva and
hyperammonemia responding dramatically to oral ngg, thus
avoiding the need for hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

parents. his birth weight was 3.8 kg; gestational age was
38 weeks; and the apgar index was 9 at 1 min and 10 at
5 min. a female sibling had died from an unknown cause in
the neonatal period, and his other siblings were healthy. on
the third day of life, the infant was hospitalized in the
neonatal intensive care unit for vomiting, feeding refusal,
and drowsiness. the patient was jittery, hypotonic, and
dehydrated, and he had sweaty feet odor. his clinical
condition and family history suggested an inherited metabolic
disease. laboratory investigations revealed hyperammonemia
(568 mug/dl; normal range, 31–123 mug/dl) and ketonuria.
urine gas chromatography revealed an increased excretion of
isovalerylglycine (1,277 mmol/mol cr; nv, 0 mumol/l), and
blood acylcarnitines demonstrated an elevation of isovalerylcarnitine (9.9 mumol/l; nv, 0–0.6 mumol/l), suggesting that
the patient had iva. oral feeding was stopped, and the baby
was treated with intravenous infusions of glucose, parenteral
lipid (after exclusion of fatty acid oxidation defect) and lcarnitine (100 mg/kg per day). in order to enhance metabolic
detoxification, a single dose of  xxxd442xxx  (150 mg/kg
per day) was administered through a nasogastric tube,
and it was well tolerated; ammonia was monitored subsequently every 2 h. over the following 6 h, the plasma
ammonia levels dropped dramatically to 72 mug/dl, and blood
ammonia remained normal thereafter. the patient began to be
bottle-fed and was discharged  xxxd1891xxx  days of life. at the age of
2 months, he has been neurologically normal, receiving
protein-restricted diet, glycine (150 mg/kg per day) and lcarnitine, with good metabolic control. the  xxxg1216xxx  activity in
the lymphocytes of the patient was severely reduced
(<0.12 nmol/min per milligram protein; reference range,
0.89–2.13), confirming iva.

intake of protein-rich foods. more recently, a third group of
individuals with mild biochemical abnormalities who can be
asymptomatic have been identified through newborn screening
of blood spots by tandem mass spectrometry. iva is sometimes
complicated by episodes of hyperammonemia [7–10].
the use of ngg has been reported in several neonates
with hyperammonemia due to organic acidemias such as
methylmalonic aciduria (mckusick 251000) and propionic
aciduria (mckusick 232000) [5, 6]. ngg is safe, fast, and
easy to administer, and it improves the acute therapy of
decompensated organic acidemia by increasing ammonia
detoxification and avoiding hyperammonemia. until now,
ngg was used only after failure of classical treatment,
even though some authors have recommended giving this
drug to neonates as soon as they suffer from severe
hyperammonemia [3, 4]. to our knowledge, the newborn
reported here is the first reported case with iva to receive
ngg for the treatment of hyperammonemia. we used a
single dose of ngg, at the loading dose of 150 mg/kg. after
one oral load of carbamylglutamate, ammonia decreased
with a rate of approximately 100–150 mug/dl per hour. this
treatment avoided dialysis, and no adverse effects attributable to  xxxd442xxx  were observed in our patient.
in conclusion, this experience suggests that carglumic
acid could be considered for acute hyperammonemia in
patients with iva. the patient reported here showed a
dramatic fall in the plasma ammonia concentration with a
single dose of  xxxd442xxx  (150 mg/kg). of
course, trials with more patients are needed in order to
demonstrate its usefulness.
consent for publication has been obtained from the
parents of our patient that was reported.

discussion

conflict of interest
interest to report.

 xxxg1216xxx  is a mitochondrial enzyme which catalyzes the
conversion of isovaleryl-coa to 3-methylcrotonyl-coa.
deficiency of this enzyme in patients with iva results in
toxic accumulations of isovaleric acid and other related
organic acids. elevated isovaleric acid itself produces the
characteristic “odour of sweaty feet”, which may facilitate
early diagnosis. the major metabolite of isovaleric acid
which accumulates in this condition is isovalerylglycine.
patients with iva may show two different forms of clinical
presentation, either an acute neonatal or a chronic intermittent presentation. those with the neonatal onset of the
disease usually present with refusal to feed, vomiting,
lethargy, severe illness, and death due to overwhelming
hyperammonemia. patients with the chronic intermittent
form are asymptomatic at baseline but have episodes of
acute metabolic decompensation, usually in the setting of
infections, physical exertion, catabolic stress, or increased
