cobalamin-c (cblc) disease is a rare autosomal recessive
disorder due to defective intracellular cobalamin metabolism. there are few (13) reported patients of the late-onset
presentation of cblc disease with paucity of detailed clinical
descriptions. this results in this condition being easily
missed. in this report, we describe clinical and biochemical
findings of two unrelated patients with late-onset cblc
disease who presented with neuropsychiatric symptoms.
serial mri images are provided for one of these patients.
presumptive diagnosis was made with urine and plasma
biochemical markers and confirmed with fibroblast analysis.

these patients illustrate the challenging diagnosis of this
disease and also report on the rare associated findings of
vasculopathy and mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction. mutation analysis of the  xxxg1416xxx  gene showed that
both patients were homozygous for 394c ! t which suggests a founder effect. ß 2007 wiley-liss, inc.

introduction

methylmalonic acidemia with homocysteinemia,
cobalamin-c (cblc) type, (omim#277400), is the
most widely reported subtype of defective intracellular cobalamin ( xxxd1771xxx ) metabolism, with
about 250 patients reported in the literature
[lerner-ellis et al., 2006]. classification of cellular
cobalamin (cbl) defects based on clinical or biochemical findings alone is unreliable. complementation studies on cultured skin fibroblasts or
molecular analysis may be required for a more
definitive diagnosis. there are at least seven variants
of defective intracellular metabolism of cobalamin,
 xxxg1414xxx  to cblh [rosenblatt and fenton, 2001]. the
cblc variant of defective intracellular cobalamin
metabolism causes decreased levels of two essential cofactors, adenosylcobalamin (adocbl) and
methylcobalamin (mecbl) which are required
for the activity of  xxxg1485xxx 
and  xxxg1479xxx , respectively. normally,
 xxxg1485xxx  [ec. 609058] catalyzes
the intramitochondrial conversion of methylmalonyl-coa to succinyl-coa, and  xxxg1479xxx 
[ec.156570] catalyzes the methylation of homo-

cysteine to methionine with recycling of tetrahydrofolate [rosenblatt and fenton, 2001]. thus, failure in
the synthesis of adocbl and mecbl impairs the
function of these two enzymes and results in
combined methylmalonic acidemia and homocysteinemia. this combination can also be caused by
severe nutritional deprivation, breast-fed infants of
vegan mothers, and in congenital defects of vitamin
b12 absorption, transportation, and cellular metabolism [higginbottom et al., 1978; rasmussen et al.,
2001; rosenblatt and fenton, 2001]. based on the
age of onset, there are two distinct clinical phenotypes of cblc disease, early-onset and late-onset,
with striking variability in clinical presentation,
survival and prognosis. the early-onset type, the
most common type, presents in the neonatal
and early infantile period with severe nonspecific

neurological symptoms including feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, hypotonia, lethargy, developmental delay, microcephaly, seizures, cerebral
edema, progressive neurological deterioration and
coma; as well as macrocytic anemia and ophthalmological abnormalities including maculopathy and
retinal degeneration [rosenblatt et al., 1997; tsina
et al., 2005]. in contrast, the late-onset cblc disease is
less common, and has a less severe presentation and
a more favorable outcome if treated. it can present as
late as the fourth decade of life with neurological
manifestations, cognitive and psychiatric problems;
gait abnormalities, and abnormal red blood cells
indices. the rare occurrence of this late-onset form
and the absence of other indicative extra-neurological findings can result in difficult and even delayed
and missed diagnosis [rosenblatt et al., 1997;
bodamer et al., 2001; roze et al., 2003]. parenteral
 xxxd2300xxx  and oral betaine are the mainstay
of treatment and found to have a dramatic effect in
normalization of the biochemical abnormalities seen
in these patients [smith and bodamer, 2002]. we
present our experience with two adolescents with
the late-onset form of cblc disease.
patient 1

a 14-year-old girl born to healthy first cousin
parents of pakistani descent presented with dementia, lactic acidosis and a vasculitic-like peripheral
neuropathy. her symptoms included depression and
progressive dementia for 2 years, with regression and
school failure. she developed incontinence, ataxia,
lethargy and generalized tonic-clonic seizures over a
4-month period. she also developed intermittent
periods of supraventricular tachycardia needing
treatment. in pakistan, brain mri reported diffuse
cerebral atrophy with no focal lesions or active
demyelination. eeg was reported normal. she was
treated with risperidol and diagnosed with an
‘‘organic psychiatric illness.’’ her neurological status
continued to deteriorate. investigations at another
institute reported normal liver function tests, csf
lactate 2.1 mmol/l (normal <2.4 mmol/l),  xxxg500xxx , peroxisomal functions, and investigations
for lysosomal diseases. her hemoglobin was low at
11.0 g/dl (normal 12.0–15.3) with borderline high
mean corpuscular volume of 94.9 fl (normal 80–94).
her serum b12 (942 ng/l) and red cell folate (99 ng/
l) were normal. nerve conduction velocities indicated a large fiber axonal neuropathy affecting motor
and sensory nerves of upper and lower limbs.
histopathology of muscle biopsy showed variability
in fiber diameter with many small type ii fibers but no
abnormalities on histochemistry and electron microscopy. sural nerve biopsy showed significant epineural perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate and axonal
neuropathy. subsequently, her respiratory chain
enzyme activity on frozen muscle was reported to

show decreased  xxxg569xxx  oxidase (complex iv/
 xxxg522xxx  ratio) 0.009 (normal 0.014–0.034).
activities of complex i, ii, and iii were normal.
amino acids and organic acids were not reported.
this led to the presumptive diagnosis of a primary
mitochondrial disease and/or possible autoimmune
vasculopathy. she was started on prednisolone
therapy (2 mg/kg/day), however, her clinical status
continued to fluctuate.
on arrival to us 2 months later, her initial physical
exam showed an obese teenager [weight 76.5 kg
(>97th centile), and height 168 cm (75th centile)].
she was very combative and disoriented. lower limb
deep tendon reflexes were absent. she had myopathic facies and high stepping gait. plasma lactate
was high 12.48 mmol/l (normal 0–2.4) and nh4 61
mmol/l (normal <35). plasma amino acids (hplc)
reported methionine 5 mmol/l (normal 6–39) and
free homocystine 15 mmol/l (normal <5). urine
organic acid analysis (gcms) showed methylmalonate/creatinine ratio of 3,240 mmol/mol creatinine
(normal <10) (see table i). a presumptive diagnosis
of a cobalamin synthesis defect was made. the
prednisolone was stopped. she was started on a low
protein diet, carnitine,  xxxd2300xxx  intramuscular injections 1 mg/day and oral betaine
250 mg/kg/day with remarkable improvement in
her clinical dementia, gait, and biochemical parameters. subsequent total plasma homocysteines
were >100 mmol/l (normal 5–15) decreasing to
<50 mmol/l.
cultured skin fibroblasts showed decreased
uptake of propionate and methyltetrahydrofolate
radioisotopes, with very little synthesis of adocbl
and mecbl. complementation analysis was consistent with a cblc defect which was subsequently
confirmed on molecular analysis showing her to be
homozygous for the r132x mutation [reported in
lerner-ellis et al., 2006]. her two siblings were tested
and were unaffected. parents were heterozygous for
the mutation. the low protein diet and carnitine were
weaned with no recurrence of the lactic acidemia or
arrhythmia after about 1 year of therapy. fibroblast
analysis for complex i–iv of the mitochondrial
respiratory complex was normal.
on follow-up at age 20 years, she remains on
treatment and continues to do well with good
biochemical control, good general health except
anxiety symptoms, and improved neuropathy albeit
still affecting gait. she is a grade a student in
university and is married (fig. 1).

a 10-year-old girl born to healthy nonconsanguineous parents of bengali descent was admitted with
acute dementia, anorexia, and progressive weight
loss. two months prior to hospital admission, shortly
after immigration to canada, she had developed an

acute dementia and catatonic psychotic behavior.
she refused to eat and had significant weight loss of
3.6 kg over a 2-week period. perinatal period was
normal. birth weight was 2.6 kg (3rd centile). there
was a history of moderate learning disability and
school failure. thus was investigated in india:
electroencephalogram, auditory and visual evoked
potentials and brain mri were reported normal.
weschler intelligence scale for children (wisc)modified for hindi scored an overall iq of 72 at 6½
years of age. she developed intermittent generalized
tonic-clonic seizures needing treatment with  xxxd1718xxx  and sodium valproate from age 8 years.
on physical exam, she was emaciated. her height
was 138 cm (75th centile), weight 19.2 kg (<<3rd
centile), and head circumference 49.5 cm (3rd
centile). she had a flat affect, lack of social engagement, had difficulty with comprehension, and was
extremely irritable. there were some dysmorphic
features (fig. 2) including triangular face, slightly
downslanting large eyes, large and prominent nose,
and micrognathia. however, she did look similar to
her older sister and her mother who were healthy,
developmentally normal, and unaffected. on neurological examination, there was decreased muscle
bulk and generalized hypotonia and proximal
muscle weakness in the upper and lower limbs but
normal reflexes. gait and coordination were difficult
to assess as she was uncooperative. serial brain mri

performed. initial mri reveals volume loss within the
corpus callosum and vermis and delay in peripheral
myelin arborization and maturation. follow-up mri
showed complete myelin arborization, but progres-

sive volume loss of supra and infratentorial structures. there were subtle bilateral and symmetric
signal increase within the basal ganglia, involvement
was slightly more prominent within the globi pallidi.
electroencephalogram showed bifrontal epileptiform activity. venous blood gas, blood lactate,
glucose, electrolytes, alt, ast, cpk, tsh, free t4,
copper,  xxxg500xxx , plasma quantitative amino
acids (hplc) [methionine 11 mmol/l (normal 6–39)],
total and free carnitine levels, serum b12 524 ng/l
(normal 200–540), and red cell folate 672 nmol/l
(normal 421–1462) were normal. her initial hemoglobin was borderline at 11.9 g/dl (normal 12.0–
16.0) with a mean corpuscular volume high at
102 fl (normal 80.0–94.0). platelets 233 (normal
150–400  109/l), neutrophils 2.74 (normal 2–
7.5  109/l) were normal. plasma total homocysteine
was high at 184 mmol/l (normal 5–15). urine
methylmalonic acid was 5,558 mmol/mol creatinine
(normal <10) (see table i). cyanocobalamin 1 mg im
daily led to only partial improvement in her
biochemical derangement. change to  xxxd2300xxx  1 mg im daily led to marked reduction in her
methylmalonic aciduria, and partial improvement
of her homocysteinemia and psychotic behavior.

late-onset cobalamin-c disorder

subsequently, cultured skin fibroblasts for complementation analysis revealed that she had the cblc
variant which was subsequently confirmed on
molecular analysis. she is also homozygous for the
r132x mutation [reported in lerner-ellis et al., 2006].
her sibling was tested and was unaffected. oral
betaine was started led to an excellent clinical and
biochemical response. on follow-up at age 14 years,
she continued to do well with good general health
and was seizure free off anti-seizure and antipsychotic medications. she attends a special school and
despite significant learning problems, is socially
happy and improving.
discussion

these patients illustrate clinically important findings among adolescent patients with cblc disease.
although the prevalence of cobalamin synthesis
defects in the pediatric population is unknown, most
reported patients present in the newborn and infant
period. these disorders present with a wide range of
clinical variability leading to challenges in making
the clinical diagnosis.
these patients illustrate the poor reliability of using
red blood cell indices and serum b12 levels as
indicators of a cobalamin disorder. as seen in 13
previously reported patients of late-onset inborn
errors of cobalamin metabolism (see table i), most
had normal/borderline low hemoglobin, and
normal serum b12. elevated mean corpuscular
volume was present in only 2/9 plus the two patients
reported here. thus, specific measurements of
urinary and plasma methylmalonic acid levels
and total plasma homocysteine are indicated in
patients with neuropsychiatric illness of unknown
cause. these are necessary biochemical markers
to make a preliminary diagnosis and allow timely
treatment.
cerone et al. [1999] reported facial dysmorphism in
seven patients with early-onset cblc disease including long face, high forehead, large and low-set ears,
and flat philtrum. patient 2 reported here exhibited
some craniofacial dysmorphic features (fig. 2)
including triangular face, slightly downslanting large
eyes, large and prominent nose, and micrognathia.
however, the facial gestalt was not like those
reported by cerone et al. [1999] and could be
reflective of her familial background. in addition,
patient 1 was nondysmorphic. we conclude that
facial dysmorphism is not a consistent feature of
patients with cblc disease particularly in late-onset
variant and different ethnic groups.
imaging features of myelin maturation delay, white
matter volume loss and basal ganglia signal increase
and cavitation have been reported in cblc disease.
findings in our patient are much less severe than
shown in the literature [enns et al., 1999; rossi et al.,
2001; longo et al., 2005].

there have been four previously reported cases of
a late-onset cblc disease associated with a vasculopathy [brunelli et al., 2002; van hove et al., 2002;
guigonis et al., 2005]. this feature was an important
and misleading finding in patient 1 which led to
inappropriate treatment with steroids. although it
cannot be proven, her clinical deterioration after the
start of steroid therapy may have been complicated
by the catabolism induced by this medication.
dysregulation of mitochondrial function causing
lactic acidemia has been described in methylmalonic
acidemia [leeds and brass, 1994; das, 1997]. it has
been hypothesized that this occurs as a consequence
of intracellular trapping of  xxxd1739xxx , downregulation of  xxxd1710xxx  cycle and anaerobic metabolism of pyruvate to lactate. rat models of induced
cobalamin deficiency have shown specific mitochondrial respiratory chain defects including complex iv deficiency [krahenbuhl et al., 1991]. we
believe patient 1 is the first reported patient of
apparent functional cytochrome oxidase (complex
iv) deficiency reported in a human patient diagnosed with an inborn error of cobalamin metabolism. this was shown on her muscle biopsy analysis.
in addition her lactic acidemia was significant.
however, her fibroblast analysis in vitro was normal,
and her lactic acidemia resolved over time with
appropriate treatment of the cobalamin disorder
suggesting that it may have been a secondary
phenomenon.
the definitive diagnosis of a cobalamin synthesis
defect is made on fibroblast culture complementation analysis and more recently molecular analysis
of the  xxxg1416xxx  gene. our two patients were of
pakistani and bengali descent respectively and were
homozygous for the 394c ! t (r132x) mutation, in
keeping with the observation of a possible founder
mutation causing late-onset disease in the indian,
pakistani or middle eastern populations [lerner-ellis
et al., 2006]. this mutation involves the cytosine
residue adjacent to guanine, at a potential cg
hotspot, resulting in a premature termination codon.
there is genotype/phenotype correlation, as 9/11
individuals homozygous for the 394c ! t (r132x)
mutation had late-onset disease [lerner-ellis et al.,
2006].
these two patients and the review of available
literature on late-onset cblc disease illustrate a
number of issues. the diagnosis of this metabolic
defect commonly starts in the neonatal and infantile
period but can have its onset later in adolescence and
adulthood, probably more commonly than previously appreciated; the presenting findings include
neuropsychiatric illness but do not consistently show
anemia or macrocytosis; methylmalonic acid and
total homocysteine levels are necessary biochemical
markers to make a presumptive diagnosis and
begin treatment before definitive tests results are
available; lactic acidemia, mitochondrial function

american journal of medical genetics part a: doi 10.1002/ajmg.a

ben-omran et al.

derangement and vasculopathy may be features,
often complicating the diagnosis; making the correct
diagnosis in these patients is important to prevent the
ongoing neurodegeneration; as described previously [smith and bodamer, 2002] these patients
do not usually respond clinically to treatment with
cyanocobalamin, even parenterally, but do respond
dramatically to  xxxd2300xxx  ( betaine) therapy. with this report, we would like to emphasize
that cblc disease should be considered as an underlying etiology in patients presenting with any
combination of progressive cognitive and neuropsychiatric findings and first-line analysis of total
homocysteine and methylmalonic acid should be
done. these patients highlight the challenges in
establishing the diagnosis of this disorder which may
result in decreased ascertainment and delays the
implementation of treatment, and genetic counseling.
