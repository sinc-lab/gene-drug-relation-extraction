ågmo, a. and c. belzung. interactions between dopamine and gaba in the control of ambulatory activity and
neophobia in the mouse. pharmacol biochem behav 59(1) 239–247, 1998.—ambulatory activity in a familiar and
novel environment as well as the time spent in a novel environment were evaluated using the free exploratory paradigm.
male mice treated with d-amphetamine, 2 mg/kg, displayed enhanced ambulatory activity in the familiar environment. the
time spent in the novel environment was reduced by amphetamine, 1 and 2 mg/kg. the  xxxg8xxx  inhibitor g-acetylen gaba (gag) reduced ambulatory activity and rearing as well as the time spent in the novel environment. the mixed
gabaa/gabab agonist  xxxd3022xxx , 200 mg/kg, reduced rearing both in the familiar and novel environments without affecting the time spent in the novel environment. amphetamine, 1 mg/kg, was then combined with ineffective doses of gag and
 xxxd3022xxx  (50 and 100 mg/kg, respectively). the gabaergics did not reliably modify the effects of amphetamine on the time
spent in the novel environment. ambulatory activity and rearing were reduced both in comparison to amphetamine 1 saline
and to control. these data show that gabaergic drugs are potentiated by enhanced dopaminergic neurotransmission with
regard to their actions on ambulatory activity and rearing. the effects of  xxxd3022xxx  1 amphetamine were then evaluated after treatment with the gabaa antagonist bicuculline or the gabab antagonist cgp 35348. neither bicuculline, 1 mg/kg,
nor cgp 35348, 100 mg/kg, blocked the actions of  xxxd3022xxx . the combined treatment with both antagonists was also unable
to reduce the effects of  xxxd3022xxx . these data suggest that the interaction between amphetamine and  xxxd3022xxx  with regard
to motor effects depends on a non-gabaa, non- xxxg828xxx . © 1998 elsevier science inc.

studies have shown that systemic or intrastriatal administration
of gaba agonists enhance stereotyped behaviors produced by
large doses of amphetamine or apomorphine (13,54). it has also
been reported that the gabaa antagonist bicuculline blocks
amphetamine-induced stereotypies (25). on the other hand,
gaba agonists are unable to reduce locomotor activation produced by large doses of amphetamine (3,6). furthermore, neither conditioned place preference nor reduced water intake observed after treatment with amphetamine are blocked by the
mixed gabaa/gabab agonist  xxxd3022xxx  or the gaba-transaminase inhibitor sodium valproate, respectively (15,55). it
seems, therefore, that several behavioral effects of dopaminergic stimulation are not affected by gabaergic agents.
there is much neurochemical evidence showing that gabaergic systems can modify the activity of dopamine neurons.

several studies have shown that many behavioral consequences of stimulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission
may be blocked by systemic administration of gaba agonists. for example, enhanced locomotor activity and stereotyped behavior produced by apomorphine are blocked by
gaba agonists at doses where these latter are ineffective by
themselves (14,29,48). intravenous self-administration of cocaine is also reduced by the gabab agonist baclofen (45).
furthermore, the disruptive effect of dopamine agonists on
discrimination learning is inhibited by subeffective doses of
gabaergic drugs (6). microinjection of baclofen into the ventral tegmental area increases the current threshold for intracranial self-stimulation (59), a response widely believed to be
dopamine dependent (60). on the other hand, muscimol reduces (64) or has no effect on current thresholds (59). other

the gabaa agonist muscimol, baclofen, the  xxxg8xxx  inhibitor g-acetylen gaba or  xxxd3022xxx  reduce
dopamine turnover both in the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic
systems (29,53,58) after systemic administration. baclofen reduces dopamine release in the frontal cortex (51,52) as well as
in the striatum, while muscimol has only minor effects (24)
when the drugs are infused locally. moreover, infusion of baclofen into the ventral tegmental area reduces dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, whereas muscimol stimulates
it (26,63). these observations suggest that stimulation of the
 xxxg828xxx  reliably reduces dopamine release, whereas
the gabaa receptor may have either the opposite or no effect.
one consequence of facilitated dopaminergic neurotransmission is anxiogenesis. amphetamine has repeatedly been
shown to have anxiogenic-like actions in several behavioral
paradigms (17,20,56). it is not known whether gabaergic
agents are able to reduce this effect. one purpose of the
present studies was to determine if this is the case. in addition,
the role of gaba receptor subtypes was evaluated. possible
effects of the combination amphetamine 1 gabaergic drugs
on ambulatory activity and rearing were also analyzed. the
free exploratory paradigm in mice (22) was used as behavioral
test. in this procedure, ambulatory activity in a familiar and in
an unknown environment as well as the preference for novelty can be quantified simultaneously. reduced preference for
novelty is taken as an indicator of neophobia or enhanced
anxiety while increased novelty preference, as observed after
treatment with several kinds of anxiolytic drugs, is considered
an indicator of reduced neophobia or anxiety (22). unlike
most other animal models of anxiety, this procedure does not
seem to be stressful to the animals because the test does not
increase plasma corticosteroid concentrations (32,33,35,41).
because stress alters activity of both gabaergic and dopaminergic systems reviewed in (28,39), it could also alter their
reactivity to drugs. a procedure where stress is minimal was
therefore considered as most adequate.
in the free exploratory paradigm as well as in other tests
for exploration and neophobia dopamine agonists have opposing effects on different parameters. while they enhance
ambulatory activity in a familiar environment they reduce
novelty preference, a consequence of enhanced neophobia
(18,27,36,44). this latter effect is a result of amphetamine’s
anxiogenic actions.
gaba availability was enhanced by the  xxxg8xxx  inhibitor g-acetylen gaba (gag). gag was used because it has been shown to reliably and dose dependently reduce ambulatory activity in rats and mice (3,4,19), and because
it enhances brain gaba concentrations with less effects on
other transmitters than other transaminase inhibitors (31).
gaba receptors were stimulated with the receptor agonist  xxxd3022xxx . this drug is itself a weak agonist at gabaa
receptors, whereas one of its major metabolites, sl 75102 ([a(4chlorophenyl) 5-fluoro 2-hydroxy benzilidene-amino]-4- xxxd3211xxx ), has almost equal affinity for gabaa and gabab receptors (12). sl 75102 is rapidly formed after administration of
 xxxd3022xxx  with peak levels in the brain about 1 h after injection (62). both  xxxd3022xxx  and sl 75102 are highly specific for
gaba receptors (30). in an effort to determine the role of
gabaa vs. gabab receptors,  xxxd3022xxx  was combined with
either the gabaa antagonist bicuculline, the gabab antagonist cgp 35348, or both. cgp 35348 is a specific antagonist at
gabab receptors, with no significant affinity for other transmitter receptors like dopamine or noradrenaline (37). this
drug has been shown to antagonize electrophysiological, neurochemical, and behavioral effects of baclofen (34,37,40).

method

subjects
male swiss albino mice (30–40 g, janvier, le genest saint
isle, france) were housed under a reversed 12 l:12 d cycle
(lights off 0800 h) with continuous access to commercial rodent pellets and tap water.
the experiments reported herein were performed in
agreement with the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals as established and promulgated by the national
institutes of health of the united states of america and with
the european community council directive 86/609/eec.
apparatus
exploration and ambulatory activity were quantified in
polyvinylchloride boxes (30 3 30 3 20 cm high) covered with
plexiglas and subdivided into six equal square exploratory
units, which were all connected by small (4 3 4 cm) openings.
the apparatus could be divided in halves lengthwise by closing a temporary partition. it was kept on a stand in the animal’s living quarters, and the tests were made in dim red light.
the observer stood next to the box being observed.
procedure
the mice were familiarized with one side of the test box
during 24 h immediately preceding the test. the temporary
partition was in place. the floor on the familiar side was covered with sawdust. food and water were freely available. at
the test, the temporary partition was removed, exposing the
subject to the novel environment. the novel side of the box
had a clean polyvinylchloride floor. the mouse was observed
for 10 min. the following behaviors were registered on a
hand-held computer: the number of familiar exploratory units
entered; the number of novel exploratory units entered; the
time spent in the novel area; the number of rears (vertical position with only the hind legs and the tail touching the floor in
the familiar area; the number of rears in the novel area. as
defined here, rearing includes leaning against the walls with
one or both forepaws. for the purpose of the present studies,
it was not considered worthwhile to distinguish rearing without support from this latter kind of rearing. a detailed description of the procedure has been published elsewhere (22).
all tests were performed between the 5th and the 8th h of
the dark phase.
drugs
d- xxxd163xxx  (research biochemicals, natick,
ma) and cgp 35348 (ciba-geigy, basel, switzerland), were
dissolved in physiological saline and injected 30 min before
behavioral test. gag (g-acetylen gaba) (merrell international, strasbourg, france) was dissolved in distilled water
and injected 3 h before the test.  xxxd3022xxx  (synthélabo, bagneux, france) was suspended in physiological saline containing
about 0.05% (v/v) of tween 80. injection was made 60 min before test. (1)-bicuculline (sigma, st. louis, mo) was dissolved
in hot physiological saline to which acetic acid was added to a
final concentration of about 0.01 m. this was made because
bicuculline is unstable at physiological ph (38). the cooled solution was injected 10 min before test. control injections of the
appropriate vehicle were made at the same time before test as
the corresponding drug. in the gaba agonist–amphetamine
interaction experiment, the vehicle injection corresponding to
the gabaergic drugs were made 90 min (the harmonic mean
of the intervals for gag and  xxxd3022xxx ) before test.

all doses mentioned in the text refer to the form of the
compound indicated above and all drugs were injected intraperitoneally in a volume of 1 ml/100 g body weight.
design
a parallel groups design was used. at each experimental
session all doses of a given drug or combination of drugs were
tested in an equal number of animals. because it was not practically possible to run all animals in a given experiment simultaneously, a small number (three or four) of mice received
each treatment. this was then repeated until a total of 9 or 10
animals had received all treatments in a given experiment.
statistical analysis
data were analyzed with the kruskal–wallis anova because the bartlett test for homogeneity of error variances
showed nonhomogeneity in several cases. a posteriori comparisons were made with the mann–whitney u-test. all probabilities given in tables and figures are two tailed.
results

amphetamine increased ambulatory activity in the familiar environment, x2(3) 5 9.598, p , 0.05. when all groups
were compared to control it was found that only the dose of 2
mg/kg had a significant effect. the time spent in the novel environment was reduced by amphetamine, x2(3) 5 21.429, p ,
0.001. doses of 1 and 2 mg/kg were effective (fig. 1). the
number of rears was not affected by amphetamine, x2(3) 5
1.105, ns, for the familiar environment and x2(3) 5 0.071, ns,
for the novel environment.
gag had a significant effect on ambulatory activity in the
familiar, x2(5) 5 14.375, p , 0.05, as well as in the novel environment, x2(5) 5 13.479, p , 0.05. the dose of 25 mg/kg increased activity in the familiar environment, but somewhat
higher doses, 50 and 100 mg/kg were ineffective. a very large
dose, 200 mg/kg, reduced ambulatory activity in the novel environment while having no effect in the familiar. there was no
effect of gag on the time spent in the novel environment,
x2(5) 5 7.495, ns. the  xxxg8xxx  inhibitor had an
effect on the number of rears in the familiar, x2(5) 5 11.761,
p , 0.05, as well as in the novel environment, x2(5) 5 20.464,
p 5 0.001. it appeared to increase the number of rears in the
novel environment after the three lower doses. however, this
effect failed to reach statistical significance (ps . 0.08). on
the contrary, a dose of 200 mg/kg reduced the number of rears
in the novel environment. when each dose was compared to
control with regard to the number of rears in the familiar environment, no significance was obtained despite the fact that
the overall test was significant. this latter turned out to be
due to the difference between the 25 and and 200 mg/kg
doses. data are illustrated in fig. 2.
 xxxd3022xxx  had an inhibitory effect on ambulatory activity
in the novel environment, x2(3) 5 7.855, p , 0.05. however,
only the dose of 50 mg/kg differed from control. larger doses
did not affect ambulatory activity, suggesting that the effect of
the 50 mg/kg dose is spurious.
no effect was found on ambulatory activity in the familiar
environment, x2(3) 5 2.525, ns, or on the time spent in the
novel environment, x2(3) 5 5.162, ns.  xxxd3022xxx  reduced the
number of rears in both the novel, x2(3) 5 10.297, p , 0.05,
and familiar, x2(3) 5 8.221, p , 0.05, environments. doses of
50 and 100 mg/kg were ineffective, while 200 mg/kg had a significant effect. data are shown in fig. 3.

interaction of gaba–dopamine
amphetamine, 1 mg/kg, was then combined with gag, 50
mg/kg, and  xxxd3022xxx , 100 mg/kg. the kruskal–wallis test
showed significant effects on ambulatory activity in the familiar, x2(3) 5 19.836, p , 0.001, and in the novel, x2(3) 5 20.437,
p , 0.001, environment. the time spent in the novel environment was also modified by the drug treatments, x2(3) 5
14.346, p , 0.01. when the number of rears was analyzed, significant effects were found both in the familiar, x2(3) 5 21.638,
p , 0.001, and novel, x2(3) 5 24.674, p , 0.001, environments.
amphetamine 1 saline reduced the time spent in the novel
environment without affecting other parameters. the combination gag 1 amphetamine had a strong inhibitory effect on
ambulatory activity both in the familiar and novel environments. it is important to note that none of these effects were
obtained when gag and amphetamine, in the doses employed, were administered separately. the time spent in the
novel environment differed neither from amphetamine 1 saline nor from control. the number of rears both in the familiar and novel environments was dramatically reduced by the
combined treatment with gag and amphetamine. it differed
both from control and amphetamine 1 saline. when  xxxd3022xxx  was combined with amphetamine, ambulatory activity in
the novel environment was much reduced. it differed both
from control and from amphetamine 1 saline. no effect was
found on activity in the familiar environment. the time spent
in the novel environment was reduced in relation to control
but was not different from that observed after treatment with
amphetamine 1 saline. when the number of rears was analyzed, it was found that the combination amphetamine 1  xxxd3022xxx  produced a strong reduction both in the novel and familiar environments. in fact, the number of rears was lower
than after control treatment or after amphetamine 1 saline.
data are summarized in fig. 4.
we then tried to block the effects of amphetamine, 1 mg/
kg, 1  xxxd3022xxx , 100 mg/kg, with bicuculline, 1 mg/kg, or
cgp 35348, 100 mg/kg. the effects of the antagonists administered together with saline were also evaluated. there was a
significant inhibitory effect of treatment on ambulatory activity in the familiar, x2(6) 5 44.476, p , 0.001, and the novel,
x2(6) 5 44.476, p , 0.001, environment as well as on time
spent in the novel environment, x2(6) 5 30.965, p , 0.001.
the number of rears in the familiar, x2(6) 5 47.581, p , 0.001,
and in the novel, x2(6) 5 46.181, p , 0.001, environments was
also reduced. when each treatment was compared to control
it was found that the mice treated with amphetamine 1  xxxd3022xxx  had a lower activity in the novel environment than
controls. no effect was obtained on ambulatory activity in the
familiar environment. the time spent in the novel environment as well as the number of rears in both the familiar and
novel environments were also reduced by the combination
amphetamine– xxxd3022xxx . these results replicate those obtained
in the previous experiment. neither bicuculline nor cgp
35348 reduced the effects of amphetamine 1  xxxd3022xxx . if
anything, these appeared to be reinforced by the antagonists.
ambulatory activity and rearing in both the familiar and
novel environments were lower after the combination amphetamine 1  xxxd3022xxx  1 bicuculline than after amphetamine 1  xxxd3022xxx  1 saline. cgp 35348 also reduced ambulatory activity in the familiar environment when given
together with amphetamine 1  xxxd3022xxx .when both gaba
antagonists were administered concurrently the time spent in
the novel environment was lower than after amphetamine 1
 xxxd3022xxx  1 saline, an effect not obtained when bicuculline
or cgp 35348 were added separately to amphetamine 1  xxxd3022xxx . ambulatory activity and rearing also appeared to be
more reduced after concurrent treatment with both antago-

nists then when they were given separately, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. finally, bicuculline
alone reduced all behaviors whereas cgp 35348 had no effect. in fact, the effects of bicuculline alone were not different
from those of amphetamine 1  xxxd3022xxx  1 bicuculline with
regard to ambulatory activity and time spent in the novel environment. however, the number of rears in the familiar environment was less reduced by bicuculline alone than by amphetamine 1  xxxd3022xxx  1 bicuculline.
although the difference was statistically significant, it was
small and its importance is unclear. data are summarized in
fig. 5.
discussion

as expected, ambulatory activity in the familiar environment was enhanced by amphetamine while the time spent in
the novel environment was reduced. it is most likely that these
effects of amphetamine are due to stimulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission. some noradrenergic antagonists have
been reported to reduce amphetamine-induced hyperactivity
in mice, but the dopamine-b-hydroxylase inhibitor fla 63
had only marginal effects while the tyrosinhydroxylase inhibitor a-methyl- xxxd3459xxx  abolished the effects of amphetamine
(46). this observation suggests that dopaminergic stimulation
is far more important than stimulation of noradrenaline.
thus, any possible effects of amphetamine on noradrenergic
neurotransmission has not been considered in the present experiments.
the inhibitory effect of amphetamine on the time spent in
the novel environment was not reliably modified by the
gabaergic drugs. this could suggest an absence of functionally relevant interactions between dopamine and gaba with
regard to neophobia or anxiogenic-like effects. however,
other explanations are equally possible. the apparent inability of the gabaergic drugs to block amphetamine’s effect on
neophobia is a consequence of a sedative action of the combined treatments. their strong effects on ambulatory activity

and rearing suggest in fact that the combination of drugs was
most sedative, and this could mask any effect on neophobia.
only further studies with additional doses of the gabaergic
compounds could eliminate this possibility. it might also be
the case that amphetamine-induced release of dopamine is
different from physiological release, and this could mean that
our conclusions are valid only for the effects of amphetamine.
dopamine itself or other dopaminergic agents could, in principle, interact with gabaergic compounds in a different way.
when a subeffective dose of gag was administered together with amphetamine, ambulatory activity and the number of rears in the familiar as well as in the novel environment
were dramatically reduced. it must be concluded, then, that
gag was strongly potentiated by amphetamine. whereas an
ineffective dose of  xxxd3022xxx  also reduced activity in the novel
environment when combined with amphetamine, this drug did
not significantly reduce activity in the familiar environment.
however, the number of rears was much reduced both in
the familiar and novel environments. it appears, then, that
 xxxd3022xxx  was potentiated in a way similar to that of gag. it
seems safe to conclude that enhanced dopaminergic activity
potentiates the inhibitory actions of gabaergic drugs on ambulatory activity and rearing in the mouse. a similar potentiation in this same species was observed by cott and engel (14)
with  xxxd439xxx , valproate and baclofen. the minor
differences between gag and  xxxd3022xxx  are probably a consequence of the different mode of action of these drugs. while
gag has an indirect action through enhancement of cerebral
gaba concentrations,  xxxd3022xxx  is a direct receptor agonist.
moreover, gag also increases extraneuronal gaba (7), and
extrasynaptic actions of the transmitter are not impossible.
bicuculline had strong intrinsic effects both on the time
spent in the novel environment and on ambulatory activity
and rearing. the first action could be a result of an anxiogenic
effect, because bicuculline has been reported to have anxiogenic-like actions in some procedures (21,42). the motor effects are more difficult to explain. in fact, bicuculline reduces
motor activity in a way similar to that of gaba agonists

interaction of gaba–dopamine

[(1,2); present data]. in this context it may be noted that benzodiazepine inverse agonists also reduce ambulatory activity
in mice (9–11). there is no immediate explanation for the fact
that drugs enhancing or reducing gabaergic activity have
similar effects on ambulatory activity.
it may be interesting to note that benzodiazepines enhance
the locomotor-stimulatory effects of amphetamine and other
stimulants (16,47,49,50). because it is generally believed
that benzodiazepines facilitate gabaergic neurotransmission through an action at the gabaa supramolecular complex, and because muscimol has similar effects (8), it appears
that stimulation of the gabaa receptor enhances the locomotor activation produced by facilitated dopaminergic neurotransmission. this coincides with most neurochemical and
behavioral data (see the introductory paragraphs). the inhibitory effects of gag and  xxxd3022xxx  on ambulatory activity
and rearing when administered together with amphetamine
cannot, therefore, be mediated by the gabaa receptor. this
notion is supported by the fact that the effects of  xxxd3022xxx 
were not altered by simultaneous administration of bicuculline. it may be noted that the dose of bicuculline used here
blocked the effects of a large dose of  xxxd3022xxx  on male sexual behavior (5). it may also be observed that the intrinsic effects of bicuculline do not invalidate the observation that it
failed to antagonize the effects of  xxxd3022xxx . to the contrary,
they show that the bicuculline dose employed indeed had a
functional effect at the gabaa receptor.
the effects of gag and  xxxd3022xxx  do not seem to be mediated by the  xxxg828xxx , because cgp 35348 did not
reduce their actions. the dose of the antagonist used here has
previously been shown to block the effects of several doses of
baclofen on sex behavior and motor coordination (40), making it unlikely that the ineffectiveness of cgp 35348 was due
to an inadequate dose. the effects of  xxxd3022xxx  are not dependent on the simultaneous activation of gabaa and
gabab receptors either, because when both antagonists
were administered together the effects of  xxxd3022xxx  were not
reduced. in agreement with this, we have previously reported

that the actions of  xxxd3022xxx  on ambulatory activity in the rat
are unaffected by bicuculline and cgp 35348 (5). a possible
explanation for this is that  xxxd3022xxx  acts at a receptor different from gabaa or gabab. the existence of a gabac receptor with cis-4-aminocrotonic acid as selective ligand has
been proposed (23), and its presence in the central nervous
system has been confirmed (43,57). however, it is not known
whether  xxxd3022xxx  binds to this receptor. in case that it did,
enhanced gaba release produced by antagonist-induced
blockade of autoreceptors could reinforce the effects of  xxxd3022xxx  on the gabac receptor, and that could account for
the larger effects of this drug when combined with the antagonists. it might be noted that neither bicuculline nor cgp35348
bind to this putative gabac receptor (61).
systemically administered drugs act at appropriate receptors throughout the nervous system and in the periphery.
data from the present studies do not allow for any conclusions as to the specific site of action. moreover, there is not
much known about which brain structures are important for
neophobia or behaviors like rearing. therefore, it would be
premature to speculate about the neuronal systems involved
in the effects observed here.
to summarize, present data show that the neophobic effects of amphetamine are not reliably modified by the simultaneous administration of gabaergic agents. the locomotorreducing effects of gabaergic agonists are much potentiated
by concurrent treatment with amphetamine. the potentiation
could not be blocked by gabaa or  xxxg828xxx  antagonists. it is possible, therefore, that another gaba receptor
is involved.
