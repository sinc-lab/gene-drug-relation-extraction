abstract-several studies have indicated important functional interactions between volatile anesthetics
and the n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) class of glutamate receptors. in the present study,.we examined
the effects of  xxxd2052xxx , chloroform,  xxxd2604xxx , halothane,  xxxd1993xxx , and isoflurane on (1)
glutamate activation of the nmda receptor complex, including glycine reversal of anesthetic
action, as revealed by t3h] (5r,10s)-(+)methyl-lo,ll-dihydro-5h-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohep~en-s,lo-imine,
dizocilpine (mk-801) binding to the cation channel, and (2) [‘hi&-4-(phosphonomethyl)piperidine-2carboxylic acid (cgs 19755) binding to the glutamate recognition site of the nmda receptor. in
agreement with previous studies, glutamate increased the binding of 1 nm [‘h]mk-801, measured after
a i-hr incubation at 37”, by up to several hundred fold. this stimulation was blocked by glutamate
antagonists and potentiated by glycine with an ecso of = 0.03 fm. glycine also had a direct stimulatory
effect on [3h]mk-801 binding at much higher concentrations (2 10 pm). all of the anesthetics examined
depressed glutamate stimulation of [3h]mk-801 binding in a concentration-dependent
manner with the
following order of potency: halothane 2  xxxd1993xxx  >  xxxd2604xxx  > chloroform >  xxxd2052xxx .
this inhibition of [3h]mk-801 binding was observed at concentrations that are routinely attained in
the cerebrospinal fluid during surgical anesthesia. moreover, the inhibition was reversed rapidly
following removal of the anesthetics from the assay medium. inclusion of glycine in the incubation
medium markedly attenuated anesthetic-induced inhibition of glutamate-sensitive [3h]mk-801 binding
with an ecus of between 0.1 and 1 fm. thus, this reversal by glycine correlated with its potentiating,
as opposed to its direct stimulatory, effect on nmda receptors. anesthetic inhibition of [3h]mk-801
binding could not be overcome by raising the glutamate concentration (i.e. the interaction did not
appear to be competitive with respect to glutamate) unless glycine was present. binding of [3h]cgs
19755 to the glutamate recognition site was also inhibited by each of the anesthetics examined. however.
with the exception of chloioform, all of the anesthetics were more potent inhibitors of glutamatestimulated [3h]mk-801 binding than they were of [3h]cgs 19755 binding. [3h]cgs 19755 binding
saturation curves in the presence of halothane and  xxxd1993xxx  indicated a decrease in the density of [3h]cgs 19755 binding sites with no change in binding affinity (i.e. the inhibition did not appear to be
competitive). these findings support the idea that anesthetic drugs disrupt nmda receptor transmission
through multiple allosteric effects on the receptor-channel activation mechanism and the glutamate
binding site.

nmdall receptors are a class of glutamate receptors
that mediate excitatory transmission in the central
nervous system. nmda receptors play a role in a
number of important neurophysiological
events,
including epilepsy, memory, and ischemic neuronal
toxicity [l]. activation of nmda receptors opens a
non-selective cation channel that is characterized by
high ca*+ permeability, relatively slow kinetics, a
large single channel conductance,
and a voltagedependent blockade by mg*+ [2]. glycine is an
allosteric co-agonist at nmda receptors, markedly

mk-801 binds to a site within the nmda ionophore
to block glutamate or nmda-stimulated
ionic
currents, while cgs 19755 is a competitive antagonist
acting at the glutamate recognition site [4,5]. the
access of mk-801 to its site within the ion channel
is sterically restricted unless the nmda receptor is
activated by an agonist. thus, [3h]mk-801 binding
can be used as an indicator of channel opening. in
the present study, [3h]mk-801 and [3h]cgs 19755
were used to determine the effects of several volatile
anesthetics on nmda receptor agonist binding and
ion channel opening.
several lines of evidence suggest interactions
between volatile anesthetics and nmda receptors:
volatile anesthetic potency is increased by the
nmda receptor antagonists mk-801[6,7] and cgs
19755 [8], as well as by polyamines, a second class
of positive, allosteric receptor modulators
[9].

isoflurane
blocks nmda-stimulated
currents in
cultured hippocampal neurons, decreasing both the
frequency of channel opening and mean channel
open time [lo]. moreover, it has been reported that
volatile anesthetics specifically depress the glutamatedependent intraneuronal
translocation
of calcium
[ll]. these latter two studies strongly suggest that
a direct interaction between volatile anesthetics and
nmda glutamate receptors is responsible for the
inhibition of channel activation. we have shown that
 xxxd1993xxx  disrupts glutamate-stimulated
binding of
[3h]mk-801 to the nmda ionophore, and that this
disruption is attenuated by the positive nmda
receptor modulator glycine [12]. the present study
was undertaken to ascertain: (1) the generality of
these phenomena
(i.e. anesthetic inhibition
of
nmda channels and its reversal by glycine) with
respect to several species of volatile anesthetics, (2)
the reversibility
of anesthetic
action, (3) the
relationship of anesthetic potency vis-a-vis nmda
receptors to their physicochemical properties, and
(4) the effects of anesthetics on ligand binding to
the glutamate recognition site.
materials

and methods

tissue preparation. membranes for radioligand
binding assays were prepared as follows: adult, male
wistar rats (harlan sprague-dawley,
indianapolis,
in) were killed by decapitation.
their cerebral
cortices were homogenized at 2-4” in 5 mm trishcl (ph 7.4). this homogenate was centrifuged at
17,000 g for 15 min. the pellet was resuspended in
buffer and treated with triton x-100 (0.04%) for
20 min at 37”, and then washed 4-5 times to remove
the triton and endogenous glutamate and glycine.
membranes used for [3h]cgs 19755 binding assays
were resuspended
in 50 mm tris-hcl
buffer
(ph 7.5). those used for t3h]mk-801 binding studies
were resuspended in 5 mm  xxxd3449xxx . protein
concentration
was determined by the method of
smith et al. [13].
radioligand binding assays. [3h]mk-801 (22.5 ci/

mmol; dupont-nen) binding was measured at 37”
for 60 min in a final assay volume of 1 ml. nonspecific
binding was determined in the presence of 1oopm
unlabeled mk-801. membranes were collected on
glass fiber filters by vacuum filtration using a
brandel cell harvester (gaithersburg,
md), and
radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation
counting using scintiverse bd (fisher scientific).
[3h]cgs 19755 (53.3 ci/mmol; dupont-nen)
binding assays were carried out at 37” for 20 min
(preliminary
experiments indicated that binding
equilibrium was reached in this time) in a 1-ml
assay volume containing 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4,
and 200-300 ,ug membrane
protein. nonspecific
binding was measured in the presence of 100 pm
cgs 19755 (ciba-geigy). membranes were collected
by vacuum filtration and radioactivity was measured
by liquid scintillation counting, as described above.
anesthetics, with the exception of  xxxd2052xxx ,
were added to assay tubes as aliquots from stock
anesthetic buffers.  xxxd2052xxx  was injected directly
into the assay medium using a hamilton syringe.
following agitation of the tubes, the membranes
were added. during the course of a 60-min
assay, the anesthetic concentration exposed to the
membrane protein decreases by lo-15% [14]. the
anesthetic concentrations reported were measured
in the aqueous assay medium from sham assay tubes
run in parallel with experimental tubes following
10 min of incubation at 37”. anesthetic concentrations
were determined by gas-liquid chromatography [ 141.
data were compiled as mean [3h]mk-801 or [3h]cgs 19755 binding values from multiple independent
experiments,
each performed
in duplicate
or
triplicate. binding parameters (b,, and kn) were
determined using nonlinear fits of saturation binding
data to a model incorporating a single population of
independent
binding sites using the computer
program nonlin ii (stephen r. ikeda, medical
college of georgia).

the magnitude of this fractional stimulation in the

the efficiency of the washin procedures in removing
endogenous glutamate and $or glycine; the fractional

the glutamate stimulation curve to the right (to ec50

inhibition (fig. 1a). moreover, cgs 19755 decreased

concentration sufficient to produce approximately 50% inhibition of [‘h]mk-801 binding ( xxxd1993xxx ,

in the absence of exogenous glutamate, glycine
produced little stimulation of [3h]mk-801 binding
at concentrations
below 10 ,um (fig. 2b). at high
concentrations,
however, glycine stimulated [3h]mk-801 binding by up to 150% (1 mm glycine in
the absence of glutamate). the difference in the
concentration dependencies for glycine stimulation
of [3h]mk-801 binding in the absence and presence
of glutamate suggests that different mechanisms
underlie the potentiating
and direct stimulatory
actions of glycine.
halothane,
 xxxd1993xxx ,
chloroform,
 xxxd2604xxx  and  xxxd2052xxx  inhibited
glutamatestimulated [3h]mk-801 binding by at least 50% (fig.

3). comparing the anesthetics in terms of their 1~4~
concentrations,
the following potency series was
obtained: halothane 2  xxxd1993xxx  > methoxyilurane
> chloroform >  xxxd2052xxx . the iq values ranged
from 0.48 to 12mm (table 1). removal of the
anesthetics from the assay medium by reduced
pressure with agitation after a lo-min exposure to
the membranes resulted in a return of [3h]mk-801
binding to control levels.
the inhibition of glutamate-stimulated
[3h]mk801 binding by each of the anesthetics was mitigated
by glycine (fig. 3). for example, the inhibition by

glycine reversal of anesthetic inhibition of glutamatestimulated [3h]mk-801 binding is illustrated in fig.
4. using concentrations of anesthetic that inhibited
stimulated binding by =50%, glycine was found to
eliminate
60% of the inhibition
produced by
 xxxd1993xxx , halothane and  xxxd2052xxx  with ecsc
values between 0.1 and 1 ,um (fig. 4a). in these
experiments, glycine was somewhat less effective at
reversing the inhibition caused by  xxxd2604xxx 
and chloroform (fig. 4b). note that the concentrations of glycine required to reverse anesthetic
inhibition of stimulated [3h]mk-801 binding correspond to the concentrations of glycine required to
potentiate
glutamate stimulation
of [3h]mk-801
binding, rather than the concentrations required to

produce a direct stimulation of [3h]mk-801 binding
(compare figs. 4 and 2b).
the influence of anesthetics on the concentration
dependence of glutamate stimulation of [3h]mk801 binding in the absence and presence of glycine
(100 pm) is illustrated in figs. 5 and 6. at glutamate
concentrations
from 1 to 100 pm, the fractional
inhibition of the stimulated binding by the anesthetic
was fairly constant; however, in the absence of
glycine, this fraction was -_50%, whereas in the
presence of glycine the fractional inhibition was lo25%.

with a density of 997 ? 29 fmol/mg protein and a
dissociation constant of 87 * 10 nm. binding was
decreased in the presence of halothane (fig. 7). the
apparent receptor density decreased to 789 f 42 and
490 * 42 fmol/mg protein in the presence of 0.6 and
1.5 mm halothane,
respectively;
there were no
changes in the dissociation constants (96 ? 10 and
78 * 28 nm, respectively). thus, this inhibition is
consistent with a noncompetitive interaction between
halothane and [3h]cgs 19755.
inhibition of 20 nm [3h]cgs 1975.5 binding by
each of the anesthetics at 37” is shown in fig. 8.

multiple effects of volatile anesthetics on nmda
receptors were revealed in radioligand binding assays
using probes for the ion channel and agonist
recognition sites: (1) glutamate stimulation of [3h]mk-801 binding was inhibited markedly by a series
of volatile anesthetics in a noncompetitive manner;
(2) glycine reversed most of the inhibition caused
by the anesthetics; (3) inhibition by the anesthetics
was readily reversed upon removal of the anesthetics
from theincubationmedium;
(4) anestheticinhibition
occurred within concentration
ranges achieved
during surgical anesthesia; (5) anesthetics inhibited
[3h]cgs 19755 binding to the glutamate recognition
site in a noncompetitive
manner,
although at
somewhat higher concentrations
and to a lesser
extent than they affected ion channel activation.
several lines of evidence suggest that blockade of
nmda receptors has an anesthetic effect. volatile
anesthetic potency is increased by the nmda
receptor antagonists mk-801 [6,7] and cgs 19755
[8], as well as by polyamines [9]. ketamine, a
dissociative
general anesthetic,

anesthetic interactions with nmda receptors

nmda transmission
by a process that is reversed
by glycine [18]. pentobarbital and  xxxd3183xxx  also
disrupt ligand binding to the nmda receptor as
well as nmda-stimulated
45ca2+ uptake by rat
brain microvesicles [19]. it is interesting that other
central nervous system depressants, such as pentobarbital,
disrupt
neurotransmission
at other
subtypes of  xxxg981xxx , including kainate and
acamino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic
acid (ampa) receptors [20].
mk-801 binds to a site within the nmda receptor
ionophore, and access to this site in the absence of
receptor agonists is sterically restricted. thus, mk801 blockade of nmda-stimulated
currents in
electrophysiological experiments requires activation
of the channel [21], and [3h]mk-801 binding is
greatly potentiated by receptor agonists (e.g. refs.
22 and 23). accordingly, the kinetics of 13h]mk801 binding are not simple. bonhaus and mcnamara
[23] have argued that agonists increase the rates of
[3h]mk-801 binding association and dissociation
without affecting the apparent affinity or steadystate level of binding; thus, basal [3h]mk-801
binding was found to equal stimulated binding after
a prolonged (8 hr) incubation at 25”. the present
binding incubations were carried out at 37” for 1 hr.
the elevated temperature was essential because of
the strong dependence of anesthetic solubility (and,
perhaps, activity) on temperature, solubility being
much greater at lower temperatures.
incubations
substantially
longer than 1 hr at 37” led to a
degradation
of the receptor as indicated by a
progressive decline in [3h]mk-801 binding. thus,
the glutamate-stimulated
increases in [3h]mk-801
binding observed in the present experiments were
accepted
as empirical
indications
of receptor
activation, and little theoretical significance was
accorded to calculated binding parameters.
site of anesthetic action. a fundamental question
is where do volatile anesthetics act to disrupt
transmission at nmda receptors. this site could be
within the cation channel, within the glutamate
recognition site, within the  xxxg904xxx , or at
some other, undefined allosteric site.
the site of volatile anesthetic action does not
appear to reside within the cation channel since (1)
basal [3h]mk-801 measured in the absence of
glutamate was not inhibited significantly by any of
the anesthetics (i.e. the inhibition was specific for
agonist-stimulated
binding),
and (2) anesthetic
inhibition observed in the presence of glutamate was
diminished by the positive modulator glycine. to
minimize the influence of endogenous agonists, the
influence of anesthetics on basal [3h]mk-801 binding
was measured
(in the absence of exogenous
glutamate) in membrane preparations that were
washed sufficiently to ensure a 400% increase in
[3h]mk-801 binding when stimulated by 100pm
glutamate.
if the ionophore
were the site of
anesthetic action, similar degrees of inhibition would
be expected no matter how the channel was opened,
whether by glutamate alone or by glutamate plus
glycine. the anesthetic action seems to be specific
for the channel activation process that is stimulated
by agonists and potentiated by glycine.
a second possibility is that the anesthetics directly

815

interfere with glutamate binding to its recognition
site on the receptor. however, most anesthetics
were less potent inhibitors of [3h]cgs 19755 binding
than of glutamate-stimulated
[3h]mk-801 binding.
moreover, the extent of inhibition of [3h]cgs 19755
binding was less than that of glutamate-stimulated
[3h]mk-801 binding. for example,  xxxd1993xxx  was
the most potent inhibitor of glutamate-stimulated
[3h]mk-801 binding but the least potent inhibitor
of [3h]cgs 19755 binding. in addition, [3h]cgs
19755 saturation curves suggested a noncompetitive
interaction between the anesthetics and [3h]cgs
19755. moreover,
increasing
concentrations
of
glutamate failed to reverse completely halothaneinduced inhibition of [3h]mk-801 binding. it should
be noted, however, that even though the anesthetics
were less potent at inhibiting [3h]cgs 19755 binding
than they were at inhibiting stimulated [3h]mk-801
binding, significant inhibition was, in fact, seen
within concentration ranges expected to be achieved
during surgical anesthesia (see below). thus, an
effect on glutamate binding is likely to make some
contribution to the disruption of nmda transmission
seen during anesthesia.
a third possibility is that anesthetics interact with
the glycine binding site. a competitive effect at the
glycine site in which glycine and anesthetic binding
is mutually
exclusive could account for the
reversibility of the anesthetic-induced
inhibition of
glutamate-sensitive
[3h]mk-801 binding by glycine.
the ecso for glycine potentiation of channel activation
by glutamate (as signaled by the increase in [3h]mk-801 binding) is comparable to the ecsovalues
for glycine reversal of halothane and  xxxd1993xxx 
inhibition of [3h]mk-801 binding. in contrast, the
direct stimulatory effect of glycine on [3h]mk-801
binding, which might involve a low affinity action at
the glutamate binding site, required considerably
higher concentrations
of glycine. that binding
inhibition by certain anesthetics such as chloroform
and  xxxd2604xxx  was less sensitive to reversal by
glycine could indicate another site of action by the
anesthetics (glutamate binding site). for technical
reasons, we were unable to reliably detect the glycine
binding site using [3h]glycine as a probe; additional
experiments
are being undertaken
using newer
radiolabeled glycine antagonists as specific probes
for this site.
there are limitations inherent in using radioligand
binding methodology to study the conformational
changes associated with the gating of receptoroperated ion channels: receptor channels respond
within milliseconds,
whereas binding protocols
generally encompass extended incubation periods.
thus, it is probable that the binding reflects ligand
interactions with a mixed population of resting,
activated and desensitized receptors. this raises the
possibility that certain of the anesthetic effects
involve alterations in the distribution of the receptor
between different functional states. desensitization
of nmda-activated currents has been demonstrated
in electrophysiological
studies of nmda receptors
in cultured embryonic neurons [24] and expressed
in xenopl*s oocytes [25]. mayer and coworkers [24]
concluded that a major action of glycine on nmda
receptors is to speed up the rate constant of recovery

816

d. c. martin et al.

from desensitization.
lerma and coworkers [25]
suggested that desensitization involves an agonistinduced conformational
change that results in
a reduced
affinity for glycine. we recently
demonstrated that  xxxd1993xxx  and halothane decrease
both the rate of onset and the extent of the nmdainduced desensitization of 45ca2+uptake by rat brain
microvesicles [26]. the precise relationship between
anesthetic action, desensitization,
and the glycine
site on the nmda receptor remains to be established.
it has been reported that under physiological
conditions,
the  xxxg904xxx 
is saturated,
cerebrospinal fluid glycine concentrations being in
the micromolar range [27]. this suggests that volatile
anesthetics
might have a limited impact on
nmda receptor function in uiuo. however, the
responsiveness
of nmda receptors to glycine
antagonists has led to the proposal that local glycine
concentrations are maintained low by glycine uptake
mechanisms or that endogenous glycine antagonists
effectively compete with the  xxxg904xxx  [27,28].
it is also possible that not all nmda receptor
subtypes possess allosteric glycine sites.
anesthetic potency. comparing in vitro anesthetic
concentrations
and those that result in clinical
anesthesia in vivo poses several obstacles. however,
the minimal alveolar concentration
(mac) values
in rats are 1.04,2.25, and 1.44% (v/v) for halothane,
 xxxd1993xxx , and isoflurane, respectively [29]. equilibration of the tris buffers used in the present
experiments with 1% (v/v) halothane or 2% (v/v)
 xxxd1993xxx  at 37” using calibrated,
agent-specific
vaporizers results in buffer anesthetic concentrations
of 0.4 and 0.65 mm [14]. corresponding isoflurane
concentrations
are in the range of 0.3 to 0.4mm.
these calculations suggest that the concentrations
of anesthetics that affect nmda receptors are
indeed within the range of concentrations achieved
in clinical practice. also, on the basis of mac
values,  xxxd1993xxx  would appear to be the most potent
of these anesthetics in the inhibition of glutamatedependent [3h]mk-801 binding.
the anesthetics depressed glutamate stimulation
of [3h]mk-801 binding in a concentration-dependent
manner with the following order of potency:
>  xxxd2604xxx 
>
halothane
>  xxxd1993xxx 
chloroform >  xxxd2052xxx  > isoflurane (table 1).
in terms of their lipophilicity (as indicated by their
oil/gas partition coefficients at 37”), the following
series is obtained:  xxxd2604xxx  > chloroform =
halothane >  xxxd1993xxx  = isoflurane >  xxxd2052xxx 
(table 1) [15]. thus, the strict correlation between
lipophilicity and anesthetic potency is not mirrored
in the correlation between lipophilicity and nmda
inhibitory potency. the simplest explanation for this
discrepancy is that, not surprisingly, the development
of the anesthetic state involves neurochemical actions
in addition to (or other than) nmda receptor
effects.
reversibility is a key characteristic of clinically
useful anesthetic agents, and is a property expected
of the neurochemical
actions of anesthetic agents
that are, in fact, responsible for producing an
anesthetic
state. the disruption
of glutamatesensitive channel activation by the anesthetics
observed in the present experiments was readily

reversed by anesthetic removal from the assay
medium.
the present results are consistent with the notion
that volatile anesthetics block transmission at nmda
receptors at clinically relevant concentrations and in
a manner that is consistent with production of an
anesthetic state. this inhibition does not appear to
involve direct actions with either the agonist
recognition site or the receptor ionophore; rather,
the inhibition appears to be specific for the ion
channel activation process (i.e. the glutamatestimulated conformational change that increases the
accessibility of [3h]mk-801 for its binding site within
the ion channel). it is possible that anesthetic actions
at obligatory allosteric sites (e.g. the glycine site)
underlies this activity.
