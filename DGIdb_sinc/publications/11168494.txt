abstract: the cytotoxicity of vincristine in vitro was investigated in b
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) cells and in normal peripheral
blood mononuclear cells. an approximately 25-fold selectivity towards
leukemic vs. normal lymphocytes was demonstrated. cells from patients
having a mature subtype (cll or cll/mix) or a slowly progressing
form of cll were signi®cantly more sensitive to vincristine in vitro than
the cases with a cll/pl phenotype or faster-progressing disease.
depending on the vincristine dose, the number of dead cll cells
accumulated slowly during the 4-d observation period. our data indicate
a marked individual variation in vincristine susceptibility among
individual cll cells. vincristine induced annexin positivity, nuclear
blebbing and dna fragmentation in cll cells. these indicate an
``apoptosis-like'' cell death. since cll cells are in the g0/g1 phase of the
cell cycle, the only known mode of anticancer action of vinca alkaloids,
i.e. anti-mitotic action, cannot explain the death of cll cells.
furthermore, similar cellular uptake and ef¯ux of vincristine by normal
and cll cells excluded pharmacokinetic differences as a cause of
selectivity of vincristine towards leukemic lymphocytes. immunostaining
of ®lamentous structures of cll cells revealed that vincristine brings
about selective changes in a-tubulin but not in b-actin or vimentin.
although the antitubulin action of vinca alkaloids in the biochemical
sense is well demonstrated, this kind of anticancer effect has not
previously been shown. vincristine is used in several regimens for cll,
but its ef®cacy in cll has never been demonstrated in a clinical context
and its value in routine cll chemotherapy has been questioned. the
present data strongly support the need for further evaluation of the role
and mode of action of vincristine in chemotherapy of cll and other
cancers as well.

it is generally assumed that vincristine is a cell-cyclespeci®c agent that blocks mitosis through metaphase
arrest (1). other metabolic effects have been noticed,
but only tubulin inhibition has been related to the
cytotoxic effects of vincristine. this drug has been
given to a large number of patients with cll,
because several combinations regimens previously
established for other b-cell cancers happened to
include vincristine. these regimes include cop,
chop, m-2 and poach (2). however, the value of
vincristine has not been proved in this disease (2).

since the majority of cll cells are not mitotically
active (3), the use of vincristine does not seem
rational.
in two recent studies, however, susceptibility of
cll cells to vincristine in vitro has been demonstrated (4, 5). in our own study (5), the highest test
concentration (1250 nm) induced an average inhibition of 86% in total protein synthesis rate of cll
cells from 20 patients when assessed by leucine
incorporation in 4-d cultures. correspondingly,
bosanquet and bell (4) demonstrated in their
differential staining cytotoxicity assay, using cells
from 216 previously untreated cll patients, that
approximately 2.28 mg of vincristine/l (2470 nm)
was required to induce a 90% reduction in the

vincristine and cll
survival of leukemic cll cells in 4-d cultures. on
the other hand, a very shallow in vitro dose±response
curve was observed in our previous study; 50%
inhibition of leucine incorporation in cll cells in
4-d cultures was induced by 50 nm vincristine, a
concentration also attainable in vivo. hence, it has
clearly been demonstrated that vincristine is active
against quiescent cll cells in vitro at clinically
relevant concentrations.
a remarkable difference in the susceptibility to
vincristine of lymphocytes from normal vs. cll
donors was also demonstrable in our preliminary
study. in contrast to leukemic cells, even the highest
test concentration (1250 nm) of vincristine had
only a minimal effect on normal lymphocytes in
vitro (5). the present work was undertaken to
con®rm this observation in a larger study population as well as to clarify the mechanisms involved in
the selective toxicity of vincristine against leukemic
lymphocytes from cll patients.

material and methods
patients and healthy study subjects

clinical specimens were obtained after informed
consent from 35 consecutive cll patients referred
to the cll outpatient clinic at tampere university
hospital (finland). the study protocol was
accepted by the ethical committee of the hospital.
diagnosis and staging were based on standard
clinical, morphological and immunophenotyping
criteria (5±8). all patients had the b-cll phenotype. clinical hematological details at the time of
sampling are given in table 1. in addition to the
cll patients, a control group was used, representing 20 healthy voluntary subjects.
samples

peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by
density gradient centrifugation as described earlier
(9). freshly isolated cells were used for immunophenotyping. cell counting was performed by using
technicon h1, h2 or h3 analyzers (bayer
diagnostica, tarrytown, ny). density gradient
centrifugation yields were good (range 29±92%,
median 58.0%, mean 61.1%, sd 16.2%, n=35) (10).
the proportion of monocytes plus polyclonal t and
b lymphocytes was 1±10%, indicating that 90±99%
of the isolated cells represented the leukemic
population. the viability of freshly isolated cells
was >95% as determined by trypan blue dye
exclusion. some experiments, with essentially similar results as with freshly isolated cells, were
performed with cells stored in liquid nitrogen. the
viability of thawed cells also exceeded 95%.

vincristine uptake and ef¯ux studies

vincristine uptake and ef¯ux were investigated in
vitro using 3h-vincristine. cells (2r106/ml) were
exposed to 50 nm 3h-vincristine or (g-3h)-vincristine sulfate (speci®c activity 6.7 and 10.5 ci/mmol,
corresponding to 244 and 389 gbq/mmol, respectively) in culture media for different time periods at
37 uc. at the end of incubation the cells were washed
twice with ice-cold pbs, and then suspended in 10 ml
of 1 m naoh+200 ml of water. the radioactivity
incorporated was measured by using a liquid scintillation counter (wallac 1410, turku, finland).
ef¯ux was measured by counting the radioactivity
retained in cells ®rst incubated as above for 120 min
and then washed twice with ice-cold pbs and further
incubated in culture media in the absence of
radioactive vincristine. washing and radioactivity
counting were as described above.
in addition to the uptake/ef¯ux experiments with
a constant 50 nm vincristine concentration, a dose±
response curve for 2-h incorporation was determined using 0, 25, 50 and 100 nm 3h-vincristine.
uptake was measured as described above.
cytostatic effects

the cytostatic effects of vincristine against human
peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy donors
and cll patients were assessed using 4-d cultures
on microplates as described in detail earlier (9). the
effects were monitored by assessing protein synthesis
using [14c]-leucine incorporation. the id80 values
were calculated from dose±response curves using
duplicate or triplicate assays and vincristine concentrations of 0, 2, 10, 50, 250 and 1250 nmol/l. in
some experiments the cells were counted hemocytometrically by using trypan blue staining to
exclude dead cells.
flow cytometry

immunophenotyping was performed by ¯ow cytometry (epics c, coulter electronics, hialeach, ca;
facscan and facscalibur, becton dickinson,
san jose, ca) using commercial mouse monoclonal
antibodies and respective immunoglobulin isotype
controls as recommended by the manufacturers (11).
an annexin-binding assay was used as an
indicator of membrane changes seen especially in
apoptotic cells. we used fitc-conjugated annexin
v ( xxxg166xxx -fitc apoptosis detection kit,
genzyme diagnostics, cambridge, ma) as
instructed by the manufacturer.
microscopy

the morphologic effects of vincristine were assessed
using an olympus bx60 epi¯uorescence microscope

equipped with ®lters for separate and simultaneous
reading at the uv/blue/green excitation range,
corresponding to white±blue/green and red ¯uorescence, respectively.
in addition to ¯ow cytometry, annexin-v-stained
cells were also examined by ¯uorescence microscope. cells were stained according to the manufacturer's instructions (genzyme diagnostics) with
fitc-conjugated  xxxg166xxx . nuclei were counterstained under cover slips using ethidium bromide
(1 mg/ml) mixed in vectashield mounting medium
(vector laboratories, burlingame, ca).

with fitc-conjugated monoclonal antibodies
according to manufacturers' instructions. cells in

cytocentrifuge preparations were ®xed for 10 min
with methanol and for 1 min with acetone at
x20 uc, and then stained for 60 min at room
temperature. the following antibodies were used:
a-tubulin (dilution 1:50, f2168, sigma chemical
co., st. louis, mi), b-actin (dilution 1:250, f3022,
sigma), and vimentin (dilution 1:100, vim 3b4,
progen biotechnic, heidelberg, germany). the
cytocentrifuge preparations were also stained with
may±grunwald±giemsa stain for light microscopy.

the dna of vincristine-exposed cells and unexposed control cells was puri®ed using an apoptotic
dna ladder kit (boehringer mannheim,
mannheim, germany). dna electrophoresis was
performed on 1% agarose gel. dna was stained

of radioactive leucine in cll cell cultures (fig. 1a).
secondly, excellent linear correlation was also
demonstrated between cell input and leucine incorporation in 4-d cultures (fig. 1b). this excludes any
signi®cant feedback effects which leukemic cells
might have on leucine incorporation. essentially
similar leucine incorporation rates were noted in
cll cells and in normal cells, although high values
were recorded in some individual cll patients
(results not shown).

from 26 cll patients performed in triplicate. in order to
facilitate statistical analysis, the leucine incorporation values
were scaled to a common level by denoting a value of 100%
to the control culture leucine incorporation for each cll
patient.

cytotoxicity of vincristine

dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity of vincristine
against cll cells was demonstrated in vitro. an
example is illustrated in fig. 2. it is noteworthy that
some time-related cell death also took place in
control cultures not exposed to vincristine. the
viability of the cells in 4-d cultures of patients from
this same cohort was investigated using trypan blue
dye exclusion. an average decrease of 29% took

with ethidium bromide and photographed. as
positive control we used u937 cells treated with
 xxxd412xxx  (4 mg/ml) for 3 h, resulting in about
30% apoptotic cells. a dna ladder (combined,
new england biolabs, beverly, ma) was used for
molecular weight markers.
results
correlation between leucine incorporation and number of living
cells

two approaches were used to validate the leucine
incorporation assay used instead of cumbersome cell
counting to examine the cytotoxicity of vincristine.
firstly, a very tight correlation was observed
between the number of living cells and incorporation

place: the cell number fell from 2.0r106/ml to
(1.42t0.34)r106/ml (meantsd, n=16).
a remarkable difference in the susceptibility to
vincristine between mononuclear cells from cll
patients and from healthy donors was demonstrated. a statistically signi®cant difference was
demonstrable using 10 nm and higher concentrations of vincristine (fig. 3). an approximately 25fold dose was needed to induce a similar reduction in
leucine incorporation in normal polyclonal mononuclear cells compared with cll cells.
we also examined the possibility that leukemic
cells might excrete cytotoxic substances to the
culture medium by mixing equal amounts of cells
from a cll patient and a healthy donor. leucine
incorporation in standard 4-d culture was additive,
excluding the possibility that cll cells excrete
signi®cant amounts of cytotoxic substances, when
treated with vincristine (results not shown).

vincristine resistance when the latter was expressed
as id80 values. id80 values for cll/pl and cllcll/mix were 954t482 nm (meantsd, n=5) and
419t399 nm (n=30), respectively (p=0.011, t-test
for independent values). correspondingly, the id80
values for slowly progressing vs. other (not previously treated) cases of cll were 180t118 nm
(n=9) and 674t470 nm (n=19), respectively. this
difference was signi®cant at a level of p=0.007.

essentially linear dose-dependent increases in vincristine incorporation were demonstrated in samples
from cll patients and healthy donors, as exempli®ed in fig. 4a. accumulation and ef¯ux of the drug
showed some variation between individuals, as
374

illustrated in fig. 4b, but no signi®cant differences
were seen between leukemic vs. healthy donors.

cell size, morphology and annexin staining

flow cytometric cell size determinations were
performed using a forward light scatter vs. side
scatter matrix. three main particle populations were
demonstrated corresponding to mean channel
numbers of 600, 320 and 120 (fig. 5). vincristine
induced a shift towards a population of smaller
particles (figs. 5a±c). a similar but slower shift
was also noted with untreated control cells
(fig. 5d). vincristine also induced membrane
annexin positivity: 8.4% of the cells belonging to
the large cell population were annexin-positive after
one day of vincristine exposure (fig. 5b), whereas
the proportion of annexin-positive larger cells in
untreated cultures remained at 2.8% during the 3-d
observation period (fig. 5d). most of the particles
in the two populations corresponding to smaller
particle sizes were annexin-positive (figs. 5a±d).
microscopy revealed ``apoptosis-like'' morphological features in vincristine-treated cultures. nuclear
condensation and destruction of the normal chromatin pattern was seen in may±grunwald±giemsastained cells (fig. 6a). instead of three distinctive
particle populations observed in ¯ow cytometry,
two main populations were observed in ¯uorescence
microscopy. one represented whole cells. some of
them looked intact but in many of them membrane
blebbing was seen (fig. 6b). the visually observed
annexin staining pattern (fig. 6b) was comparable
to that observed in ¯ow cytometry (fig. 5). the
second particle population in ¯uorescence microscopy consisted of subcellular corpuscles, evidently
representing ``apoptotic bodies''. practically all of
them were annexin-positive. some of these particles
contained material which stained positively in

ethidium bromide staining. this red ¯uorescence
most likely represented dna (fig. 6b).
effect of vincristine on a-tubulin, b-actin and vimentin

cll cells contained moderate amounts of these
®lamentous proteins, as indicated by direct immuno¯uorescence staining using fitc-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (not shown). b-actin and vimentin
positivity was seen as cytoplasmic green ¯uorescence, which appeared to be most intense close to the
nuclear membrane. vincristine treatment did not
essentially change this staining pattern in 4-d
cultures in intact-looking cells. the intensity of  xxxd3440xxx  and vimentin staining was weaker or absent in
``apoptotic bodies'' (not shown).
in contrast to actin and vimentin, a-tubulin
staining intensity was not homogeneous. in most
untreated cells, one prominent spot, localized near
the nuclear membrane, was observed (fig. 6c). this
structure remained visible in most cells during the
4-d observation period. vincristine induced remarkable changes in the a-tubulin staining pattern, as
demonstrated in fig. 6d. strongly positive material
accumulated close to the nuclear membrane. these
changes were clearly visible after one day of
exposure. they were seen in a great proportion of
cells towards the end of the 4-d observation period.
such changes were never seen in control cultures.
the material in vincristine-treated cells formed

irregular spots and often also needle-like structures.
sometimes they were clearly visible in ``apoptotic
bodies'' (fig. 6d), where the ¯uorescence intensity
was otherwise weaker than in whole cells.
dna electrophoresis

the effect of vincristine on the integrity of cll cell
dna was investigated by dna electrophoresis.
before the in vitro incubation, most of the dna of
cll cells was in an intact macromolecular form
(fig. 7). vincristine induced dna breakage, which
was visible as a smeary electrophoresis pattern.
there was also weak nucleosome-size ladder formation after 24 h of vincristine exposure (fig. 7).
less prominent changes were observed in untreated
control cells (fig. 7). remarkable apoptotic ladder
formation was seen in the dna of u937 cells treated
with  xxxd412xxx  (fig. 7).
discussion

our data con®rmed previous observations about the
cytotoxicity of vincristine against cll cells in vitro.
furthermore, our observations con®rm and extend
the preliminary report (5) on the selective toxicity of
vincristine against leukemic vs. normal lymphocytes. an approximately 25-fold concentration was
required to induce similar cytotoxicity in normal

mononuclear cells. this latter population consists
mainly of polyclonal t-cells and to a lesser extent, blymphocytes and monocytes. hence, the relative
vincristine resistance particularly concerns t-lymphocytes, but probably also b-cells and monocytes.
this is in accordance with the clinical experience of
vincristine. it is not markedly immunosuppressive.
this does not, however, exclude the possibility that
the closest benign counterpart of b-cll (12), i.e. the
cd5-positive b-cell, would be as sensitive as the
cll cell.
an interesting clinical association emerged from
the present data. slowly progressing cases of cll
were associated with increased sensitivity to vincristine in vitro when compared with faster-progressing
376

forms. we excluded the cases having chemotherapy
and whose disease progression was not evaluable.
also excluded were two cases who had received
vinca alkaloids previously. hence there is a link
between progression velocity and de novo resistance
to vincristine. another association was signi®cantly
increased vincristine resistance among cases of the
cll/pl subtype of cll. this phenomenon
appeared to be independent of fast progression
velocity as a confounding factor in our small number
of cases. clinical and laboratory features of cll/pl
are at least in some respects intermediate between
those of cll and pll (6). chemoresistance in vitro
is a new aspect of this difference. although there is
no information available about the sensitivity of

vincristine and cll

pll to vincristine in vitro, the general clinical
chemoresistance of pll suggests that this can also
be expected to take place in vivo.
the pharmacokinetics of vincristine has been
investigated in a few studies. for example, a mean
auc0-? of 54t35 ng/ml/h was obtained after a
dose of 1.1t0.3 mg/m2 (n=31) (13). as shown in
another investigation (14), it is obvious that these
concentrations are not toxic to cll cells in vivo if
vincristine is used as a single drug. considerably
higher concentrations are required to kill cll cells,
as shown in the present in vitro study.
the only known mechanism of the antineoplastic
action of vincristine is its function as a cell-cyclespeci®c agent blocking cells in mitosis (1). however,
this does not explain the selectivity observed in the
present investigation, because the great majority of
normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells and
cll are non-cycling (3). in fact, we carried out a
¯ow cytometric cell cycle analysis on all these cll
cases. the number of g1/g0 cells always exceeded
95% (unpublished data).
the second conceivable explanation for the
selectivity of vincristine action involves different
pharmacokinetics. this possibility was also
excluded in the present work. essentially similar
cellular uptake and ef¯ux kinetics of vincristine
with some variability were demonstrated in both
types of cell population studied. interestingly,
some of the variability of vincristine accumulation
may be explained by differences in surface
immunoglobulins (15) as well as intracellular
tubulin content (16). this also excludes the role
of p-glycoprotein, the most extensively studied

mechanism of multidrug resistance in human cells.
moreover, the reported higher levels of p-glycoprotein mrna and protein in cll cells than in
their normal counterparts, reviewed in ref. 17,
would suggest a greater resistance rather than
sensitivity of cll cells to vincristine.
various cytoskeletal components have been
analyzed in normal and cll lymphocytes, and
several reports have detailed the biochemistry and
function of these proteins in b-cll (18). however,
we have not found any information about the effect
of this drug on cytoskeletal components of cll
cells. according to our data the effect on intermediate ®laments (vimentin) and actin ®laments
was negligible, whereas prominent changes were
induced in tubulin. it is very likely that the
vincristine-induced tubulin accumulation does not
contain a wide variety of cytoplasmic components.
otherwise the exclusion of actin and vimentin from
these structures would be hard to explain. these
tubulin anomalies were never observed among
control cells, although some part of them died
during the 4-d culture period. in addition to the key
role of tubulin in the formation of mitotic spindles,
microtubules are involved in other cellular functions such as movement, phagocytosis, and axonal
transport. side effects of vincristine, such as
neurotoxicity, may be due to disruption of these
functions (1). here we demonstrated that this kind
of action of vincristine is especially linked to its antitubulin effect. it has been shown that vincristine
induces ``apoptosis-like'' cell death of mitotically
active cells (19). our results suggest that effects
other than anti-mitotic effects of vincristine may
have a role in its anticancer action. this is in
agreement with our ®nding that slowly progressing
patients were also the most sensitive to the cytoxic
effects of vincristine.
in addition to marked selectivity towards cll
vs. normal lymphocytes, our results demonstrated
a remarkable variation in the sensitivity to
vincristine among individual cll cells. this fact
was substantiated with the slow progression of
trypan blue positivity (fig. 2). furthermore, the
shallow dose±response curve demonstrated that an
approximately 5-fold increase in vincristine concentration was required to decrease leucine
incorporation by an additional 50% (fig. 3).
other data, such as annexin positivity and
dna fragmentation, also indicated heterogeneity
of susceptibility of individual cll cells to
vincristine. this kind of response to various
anticancer agents is also seen in clinical chemotherapy of cll. the present model represents a
versatile tool to investigate details of the chemosensitivity and resistance of individual cll cells.
