inc. (raritan, nj). thefollowing supernatant monoclonal antibodies
against the fc,ri were used in this study: iggl mab 32 (6) reacts
with an epitope on the fc,ri distinct from the ligand binding site for
human igg1, igg3, and mouse iggba, igg3. mab 22 and 44 are iggl
mab which define another epitope on the fc,ri, distinct from the
ligand binding site and different from that identified by mab 32 (5).2
reactivity ofmab22,44,
and 32 with the indicated epitopes was
determined by cross-competition and additivity experiments. iv3, an
igg2b antibody that binds to the 40-kda fc-receptor (7), was kindly
provided by dr. clark anderson, ohio state university, columbus,
oh. okm1, an igg2b mab directed against the cr3 receptor, and
w6/32 (20), an igg2a antibody which binds to a frame work determinant on hla-a and hla-b antigens, were obtained from american type culture collection (rockville, md). yz-1, an antibody
directed against the cr1 receptor was kindly provided by dr. rick
jack, harvard medical school, boston, ma (21). anti- xxxg1208xxx , an
igg2b antibody which recognizesthe  xxxg23xxx   xxxg24xxx   xxxg163xxx ,95 antigen, was purchased
from becton dickinson, mountain view,ca. ts 1/18, aniggl
antibody against the @-chainof the lfa-1 molecule, was obtained
from dr. steven burakoff, dana farber cancer institute, boston,
ma. fitc-conjugated anti-mouse igg fabl was purchased from tag0
inc., burlingham, ca and from caltech laboratories, south san
francisco, ca.
reagents-superoxide dismutase, glutathione, histidine, ascorbic
acid,  xxxd3521xxx ,  xxxd306xxx , and  xxxd1896xxx  were obtained
from sigma. superoxide dismutase mimic, bis[(3,5-diisopropyl salicylate) (0, o)]copper(ii),was synthesized as described previously (22).
purity was verified by elemental analysis and ir spectral measurements. hpd was prepared according to the method of lipson et al.
(23), and dhe was generously provided by photofrin inc., raritan,
nj. for both reagents, a stock solution was made by diluting the
samples in normal saline to obtain the desired concentrations.
monocytes and u937cells-human
monocytes were isolated in
the following manner. peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from the heparin-treated blood of healthy human volunteers
of  xxxd3253xxx -hypaque (pharmacia lkbbiotechnology inc.) density sedimentation. cells were subsequently allowed to adhere to 100 x 20mm tissue culture dishes (falcon, oxnard, ca) for 1 h. plastic
adherent cells were removed from the petridishes by gentle scraping
with a rubber policeman. these cells were 85-90% nonspecific esterase-positive and for the purposes of this study will be called monocytes.
u937 cells (24) were obtained from american type culturecollection, rockville, md. the cell lines were maintained in rpmi 1640
(gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (hyclone, logan,
ut), with l-glutamine and antibiotics at 37 "c ina humidified
atmosphere containing 5% co2. prior to photosensitizer treatment,
u937 cells were incubated with interferon-y to upregulate fc receptor
expression (9). this was performed by incubating u937 cells with 100
units of human recombinant interferon-y (genentech, south san
francisco, ca) at a concentration of 1 x lo5 cells/ml for 48 h in
complete medium.
porphyrin photosensitization-for porphyrin photosensitization,
2 x io6 freshly isolated human monocytes or u937 cells which had
been incubated with interferon-y for 48 h were placed in 35 x 10-mm
culture dishes (falcon, oxnard, ca) in hanks'  xxxd2988xxx 
without phenol red (kc biologicals, lenexa, ks). various concentrations (1.25-10 pg/ml) of either hpd or dhe were added, and cells
were then immediately exposed to light from a black ray longwave
ultraviolet lamp (uv-products inc., san gabriel, ca). irradiance a t
405 nm was monitored with an il 700 research radiometer coupled
to an see 010 photodetector, w1012 diffuser, and 1543 filter (international light, newburyport, ma). output was found to be 1.8 x
watts/cm2 at a lamp to target distance of 12 cm. during light
exposure, culture dishes were kept on ice and were shaken every 15 s
to obtain homogeneously photosensitized cell populations. once the
light exposure was completed, cells were kept in the dark. monocytes
or u937 cells were removed from the dishes by scraping with a rubber
policeman, centrifuged, resuspended in buffer, and counted. cells
treated with light alone or photosensitizer alone were handled in an
identical fashion. in some experiments, various scavengers of reactive
oxygen intermediates were added at indicated concentrations prior to
photosensitization.
staining and flow cytometry-immediately after photosensitization, one million cells were incubated for 30 min or 2 h at 4 "c with

saturating concentrations of the primary antibody in the presence of
4.8 x
m  xxxd2207xxx  (to block nonspecific binding). cells were
then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline-bovine
 xxxg124xxx  and incubated for 30 min to 1 h with saturating
concentrations of fitc-conjugated f(ab')z anti-mouse immunoglobulin. samples were then washed three times and immediately analyzed by flowcytometry using an ortho 11s flow cytometer interfaced
to the ortho 2151 data aquisition system (at case western reserve
university) or using an ortho cytofluorograph system 50h and the
system 2150 computer (at dartmouth medical school). in some
experiments, the relative number of mab bound to surface receptors
or antigenswas quantified by the use of latex beads (flow cytometry
standards corp., research triangle park, nc) containing six different concentrations of fluorescein molecules per bead according to the
method of le bouteiller et al. (25).
radiolabeling and sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-u937
cells, which had been incubated for 48 h with recombinant human
interferon-y, were harvested, washed, and photosensitized with dhe
as described previously. following photosensitization, 20 x io6 cells
were labeled with lz5i using the iodogen reagent (pierce chemical
co.). immediately after iodination, cells were lysed for 30 min a t 0 "c
in nonidet p-40 lysis buffer containing 1% nonidet p-40, 110 mm
nacl, 10 mm edta, 2 mm polymethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 pg/ml
pepstatin, 10 pg/ml chymostatin, 10 pg/ml leupeptin, and 10 pg/ml
antipain in 20nm  xxxd3449xxx  a t a ph of 8.0 to optimize binding of
mab 32or  xxxd2676xxx  toprotein a-sepharose. after lysis, nuclei and large
debris were removed and thecytosol was frozen in aliquots.
for immunoprecipitation, lysates were allowed to thaw at 4 "c and
10 pl of the indicated ascites fluid was added to 50 or 100 pl of the
cytosol. this mixture was left overnight a t 4 "c. the next day the
antibody fc,ri complexes were added to protein a-sepharose
(sigma), mixed for 1 h, pelleted, and the pellet washed 3 times with
a high-salt wash buffer (lysis buffer plus 0.1% sds, 0.2%  xxxd1835xxx , and 0.5 m  xxxg2020xxx ) to remove nonspecific protein. a final wash
wasgiven in wash buffer without nacl and ovalbumin and the
proteins dissociated by boiling the pellet in sds sample buffer containing 20 mm dithiothreitol to reduce the samples. before running
the samples on the gel,  xxxd2684xxx  was added in 1.5 molar
excess to alkylate the samples. samples were run on 7.5 % acrylamide
slab gels (bio-rad) prepared according to laemmli (261, at 25 ma/
gel. cells were fixed, stained, and dried according to standardprocedures. autoradiograms were done on kodak x-omat ar film (eastman kodak co., rochester, ny) using intensifying screens.
the only visible bands of coomassie blue stain in the sample lanes
were the antibodies present inthe ascites. molecular weight standards
were also run on each gel.
assay for monocyte accessory cell function-fc,ri-mediated accessory cell function of monocytes was assessed by examining their
ability to induce proliferation of responder t lymphocytes in a system
in which  xxxd2676xxx  served as the mitogenic stimulus. to obtain the
responder cell population, t cells were purified from the peripheral
blood of healthy human volunteers by a rigorous four-step purification
procedure. briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained
from healthy human volunteers by  xxxd3253xxx -hypaque (pharmacia lkb
biotechnology inc.) sedimentation. they were then placed on 100 x
20-mm tissue culture dishes (falcon, oxnard, ca) for1h. the plastic
nonadherent cell population was then removed and incubated on
nylon wool columns (fenwall laboratories, deerfield, il) for 45 min.
nylon wool nonadherent cells were next exposed to  xxxd2460xxx  methyl
ester (sigma) for 40 min according to themethod of thiele et al. (27).
 xxxd2460xxx  methyl ester-treated t cells were then treated with a 1 5 0
dilution of okia monoclonal antibody (ortho pharmaceuticals, raritan, nj) and low toxicity rabbit complement (cedarlane laboratories, hornby, ontario,canada). the resulting t cell population
contained less than 0.1% ia-positive cells as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis and was, without the addition of
exogenous accessory cells, completely unresponsive to concanavalin
a and  xxxd2676xxx . 1 x lo5 highly purified t cells were cocultured with 2
x io4 autologous, in uitro photosensitized monocytes and  xxxd2676xxx  in a
total volume of 200 pl.  xxxd2676xxx  andmonocytes were used in concentrations which in preliminary experiments gave optimal proliferative
responses. culture medium consisted of rpmi 1640 supplemented
with 10%pooled human serum, penicillin (10,000pglml), l-glutamine
(2 mm), and hepes buffer (10 mm). cultures were set up in 96-well
round bottom microtiter plates (corning glassworks, corning, ny)
and incubated for 72 h at 37 "cin 5% cozhumidified air. all variables

(a, lanes 1 and 2) could be detected. however, when a mouse
igg2a (b, lane 1 ) rather than mab 32 (b, lane 2 ) was used to
purify fc,ri, significantly weaker bands were obtained, thus
confirming our initial observation that porphyrin photosensitization markedly inhibited the capacity
of fc,ri to bind its
ligand.

involvement of reactive oxygen species-porphyrin-induced photodamage to membranes is thought to
be mediated
by the generation of superoxide anion and singlet oxygen as

fc,ri function after porphyrinphotosensitization-in order to examine whether the
observed structural alteration of
fc,ri would render this receptor inactive in functional assays,
human peripheral blood monocytes, which had been treated

receptor nor expression of a variety of other surface receptors,
such as class i mhc molecules, adhesion molecules, and
complement receptors. furthermore, the observed structural
alteration led to a potentdown-regulation of fc,ri-mediated
functions. specifically, dhe plus visible light treatment of
human peripheral blood monocytes was found to inhibit their
accessory cell function for  xxxd2676xxx -induced t lymphocyte activation. thus, these studies identify porphyrin photosensitization asa method by which to selectively modify the
structure of fc,ri. this treatment could therefore serve as a
useful tool for further investigation of the localization of
various epitopes on fc,ri and thus may be of help in elucidating the special conformation of this receptor molecule.
the findings provided by this study may also add to the
understanding of the pathomechanisms underlying several
diseases. many pathological conditions have been described
in which increased fc receptor function is thought to be at
least partially responsible for the pathogenesis of the disease
process (3,4). blood monocytes of patients with warm autoimmune hemolysis (3), for example, have been found to express
increased numbers of fc receptors on their cell surface, and
it has been proposed that enhanced fc receptor function may
contribute to thedeficient clearance of blood elements coated
with igg autoantibodies. moreover, porphyrin photosensitizers are currentlyused both in the diagnosis and management
of various malignant neoplasms in a modality known as
photodynamic therapy (13, 14). so far, the only side effect
described, which is associated with this therapy, has been
photosensitization of the skin (14). the present observation,
that sublethal concentrations of dhe plus light down-regulate fc,ri-mediated functions, may point to a new and previously unrecognized side effect. further studies will be required, however, to evaluate the significance of these i n vitro
findings for clinical situations.
there are at least three mechanisms by which porphyrins
and light could selectively down-regulate the fc,ri receptor
while having relatively little effect on other cell surface molecules. first, it is known that only those amino acids with
electron-rich side chainsare subject to structural changes
following treatment with porphyrinsand light (32). it is
therefore possible that the fc,ri receptor is composed of a
disproportionate number of, or a strategically located group
of, histidine, methionine, cysteine, tryptophan, and tyrosine
residues which contain theseelectron-rich side chains. in this
case the selectivity of porphyrins and light for fc,ri, compared to other cell surface structures, wouldbe based on
differences in amino acid composition. alternatively, recent
studies by bozeman et al. (19) have demonstrated that oxidants generated by xanthine: xxxg2431xxx  inhibit ligand
uptake by the rat macrophage mannose receptor. oxidants
generated by porphyrins andlight could conceivably act in an
analogous manner with respect to binding by the fc,ri receptor. finally, previous studies from our laboratory suggest that
a calcium-dependent protease is activated following i n vivo
treatment of experimental animals with porphyrins and light
(33). a critical portion of the fc,ri receptor on monocytes
could be a substrate for this protease. however, if a protease
is responsible for the impaired binding activities of fc,ri, the
proteolytic fragment containing the ligand binding site would
have to be small since no change in molecular weight was
observed on sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
the ability of human monocytes to function as accessory
cells for  xxxd2676xxx -induced t lymphocyte activation can also be
abrogated by in vitroexposure of monocytes to sublethal doses

ofuvb r a d i a t i ~ n .we
~ previously have demonstrated that
uvb-irradiated monocytes failed to bind  xxxd2676xxx -cd3 complexes, indicating a defect at the level of fc,ri. in addition,
it was found that fc,riwas still present on uvb-treated
monocytes and was capable of binding fitc-okts (fig. 2),
but that the defect in monocyte accessory cell function was
associated with a uvb dose-dependent reduction in monocyte
membrane fluidity. thus, bothuvb radiation and porphyrins
plus visible light rendered human peripheralblood monocytes
incapable of functioning as accessory cells for  xxxd2676xxx -induced
t lymphocyte activation. these modalities, however, differed
completely in the mechanism by which fc,ri function was
modulated. uvb did not seem to have any direct effects on
the receptor molecule, whereas hpd or dhe plus light treatment caused a structural alteration of fc,ri. furthermore,
porphyrin photosensitization was found to increase rather
than decrease monocyte membrane f l ~ i d i t y . ~
reactive oxygen species such as singlet oxygen, superoxide
anions, and hydroxyl radicals are thought to be generated via
porphyrin photosensitization and to mediate photodestruction of cells primarily by alterating cell membrane integrity
(17,29,30). inorder to evaluate the type of free radical which
was responsible for the functional inactivation offc,ri, a
variety of quenchers and inhibitors of reactive oxygen intermediates were tested for their ability to protect fc,ri during
dhe photosensitization. in the presence of superoxide dismutase mimic binding of fitc- xxxd2676xxx  to fc,ri was substantially restored, and, even more important, fc,ri-mediated
accessory function of dhe-treated monocytes was partially
protected. thus, the dhe-induced alteration of fc,ri appeared to involve the generation of superoxide anions. moreover, quenchers of singlet oxygen such as histidine, vitamin
c,  xxxd3521xxx , and quenchers of hydroxyl radicals such as
 xxxd1896xxx  and  xxxd306xxx  did not have any protective effect, indicating a major, if not exclusive role for superoxide radicals inthis process. this is in agreement with
previous findings indicating that dhe and light-induced effects on microsomal membranes were predominantly caused
by the generation of superoxide anions (17).
taken together, these experiments identify porphyrin photosensitization as amechanism by which to selectively downregulate the function of fc,ri on human peripheral blood
monocytes. this down-regulation is associated with a structural alteration of the receptor molecule which appears to be
caused by the generation of superoxide anions during the
photosensitization reaction. this demonstrates a previously
unrecognized property of porphyrin photosensitizers, which
may be of importance for the selective inhibition of fc,rimediated functions in certain clinical situations. it may also
represent a novel approach with which to further study the
structure and function of this receptor molecule.
