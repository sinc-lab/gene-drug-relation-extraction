 xxxd2724xxx , an orally bioavailable, selective
bcr- xxxg23xxx   xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor, is 30fold more potent than imatinib in preclinical models, and overcomes most imatinib resistant bcr- xxxg23xxx  mutations. in
this phase 2 open-label study, 400 mg
 xxxd2724xxx  was administered orally twice
daily to 280 patients with philadelphia
chromosome–positive (phⴙ) chronic
myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (cmlcp) after imatinib failure or intolerance.
patients had at least 6 months of followup and were evaluated for hematologic

and cytogenetic responses, as well as for
safety and overall survival. at 6 months,
the rate of major cytogenetic response
(ph < 35%) was 48%: complete (ph ⴝ 0%)
in 31%, and partial (ph ⴝ 1%-35%) in 16%.
the estimated survival at 12 months was
95%.  xxxd2724xxx  was effective in patients
harboring bcr- xxxg23xxx  mutations associated with imatinib resistance (except
t315i), and also in patients with a resistance mechanism independent of bcrabl mutations. adverse events were
mostly mild to moderate, and there was

minimal cross-intolerance with imatinib.
grades 3 to 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 29% of patients;
pleural or pericardial effusions were observed in 1% (none were severe). in summary,  xxxd2724xxx  is highly active and safe in
patients with cml-cp after imatinib failure or intolerance. this clinical trial is
registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov as id

introduction
chronic myeloid leukemia (cml) is a clonal myeloproliferative
disorder characterized by the expansion of hematopoietic cells
carrying the philadelphia chromosome (ph), resulting from a
reciprocal translocation of the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22.
a novel fusion gene is formed, bcr- xxxg23xxx , which encodes a
constitutively active protein  xxxg2198xxx .1,2
imatinib (gleevec, glivec; novartis pharmaceuticals, florham
park, nj), a bcr- xxxg23xxx   xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor, has dramatically
improved outcome in cml.3-6 in newly diagnosed patients with
cml, imatinib is associated with a complete cytogenetic response
rate of 87%, a progression rate to accelerated or blastic phase of
7%, and an estimated 5-year survival rate of 89%.3,6
resistance to imatinib occurs annually in 3% to 4% of patients
with cml in chronic phase (cml-cp), and is defined as failure to
achieve complete hematologic response (chr) within 3 months of
therapy, any cytogenetic response within 6 months, or major
cytogenetic response (ph⫹ ⱕ 35%) within 12 months, or the
development of cytogenetic or hematologic relapse.7 resistance

can be mediated through bcr- xxxg23xxx –dependent mechanisms, often
through mutations in the  xxxg23xxx  kinase domain (40%–50%), or by
mechanisms independent of bcr- xxxg23xxx .8 in patients with cml and
resistance or intolerance to imatinib, alternative treatments are
needed.8-10  xxxd1815xxx , which inhibits bcr- xxxg23xxx  as well as the
src-family kinases, has produced major cytogenetic responses in
52% of patients with cml-cp following resistance or intolerance
to imatinib.11,12
 xxxd2724xxx  ( xxxd2724xxx ; n-[3-[3-(1h-imidazolyl)propoxy] phenyl]4-methyl-3-[[4-(3-pyridinyl)-2-pyrimidinyl]amino] benzamide; novartis pharmaceuticals), a novel orally bioavailable derivative of
imatinib, is a  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor with improved target
specificity.13,14 based on an understanding of the molecular mechanism of imatinib activity, structural modifications led to the
development of  xxxd2724xxx .15 like imatinib,  xxxd2724xxx  inhibits bcrabl by binding to an inactive, dfg-out conformation of the  xxxg23xxx 
kinase domain, thus preventing the enzyme from adopting the
catalytically active conformation and blocking the tyrosine phos-

the improved binding of  xxxd2724xxx  results in greater potency and
selectivity over the kit and pdgf receptor kinases and has no
activity against targets such as the src-family of tyrosine kinases.17
in preclinical models,  xxxd2724xxx  was 30 times more potent than
imatinib in imatinib-sensitive cml cell lines, and maintained
activity in 32 of 33 imatinib-resistant bcr- xxxg23xxx  mutant cell lines,
encouraging its development in cml.18 results from a phase 1
dose escalation study performed in patients with imatinib-resistant
cml and ph⫹ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) indicated that
 xxxd2724xxx  produced significant hematologic and cytogenetic responses in all phases of cml.19 side effects potentially related to
 xxxd2724xxx  included grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity, with cytopenias in 6% to 20% of patients, as well as transient indirect
hyperbilirubinemia and skin rash.
the primary objective of this phase 2 study was to determine
the rate of major cytogenetic response in patients with cml-cp
following resistance or intolerance to imatinib. the results presented are from an interim analysis conducted on the first
280 consecutively enrolled patients with at least 6 months of
follow-up.

among 20 or more metaphase cells in each bone marrow sample.
fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) studies to document cytogenetic
response were accepted if routine cytogenetic studies were not successful or
not available at a particular analysis time. complete blood counts and
biochemistries were obtained weekly for the first 8 weeks, and thereafter
every 2 weeks. bone marrow assessments were done on day 28 of cycle 1
and every 3 months. cytogenetic studies on bone marrow samples were
performed at baseline and repeated every 3 months in responding patients.
safety assessments included evaluation of adverse events, hematologic
assessment, biochemical testing, urinalysis, cardiac enzyme assessment,
serial electrocardiogram evaluation, and physical examination. adverse
events were graded according to the national cancer institute common
terminology criteria for adverse events version 3.0. survival was dated
from start of  xxxd2724xxx  therapy until death from any cause and censored at
last follow-up for patients who were alive. duration of major cytogenetic
response was measured from date of response until the date treatment was
discontinued for progression or death. patients who discontinued for other
reasons were censored at date of last treatment and patients still on
treatment at data cut-off date.
the study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of
helsinki. the study protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethics
committees or institutional review boards of all participating centers. all
patients gave written informed consent according to institutional guidelines.
assessment of bcr- xxxg23xxx  mutation status

patients, materials, and methods
patients and study design
patients with ph⫹ cml-cp who were at least 18 years of age were eligible
if they had imatinib resistance or intolerance, adequate performance status
(world health organization performance score ⱕ 2), and normal hepatic,
renal, and cardiac functions. patients with imatinib resistance had to have
been treated with a dose of at least 600 mg daily for 3 months. patients in
accelerated or blastic phases,20,21 or patients who received treatment with
imatinib for 7 days and with hydroxyurea for 2 days prior to  xxxd2724xxx , were
excluded. potassium and magnesium levels had to be greater than or equal
to the lower limit of normal or corrected to within normal range. for safety,
patients receiving concomitant medications known to prolong the qt
interval or inhibit cyp3a4 were excluded if alternative treatments were not
possible. imatinib resistance was defined as failure to achieve chr after
3 months, cytogenetic response after 6 months, major cytogenetic response
after 12 months, or loss of a hematologic or cytogenetic response at any
time during treatment with imatinib. entry criteria for imatinib intolerance
included patients with intolerant symptoms, but who also had never
achieved a major cytogenetic response with imatinib. intolerant symptoms
were defined as any nonhematologic toxicity of grade 3 or higher severity,
or of grade 2 or higher severity lasting more than 1 month or recurring more
than 3 times despite dose reduction and maximal supportive care. the
definition of intolerance also included hematologic toxicity of grade 4
severity persisting for more than 7 days. imatinib-intolerant patients who
had previously demonstrated sensitivity to imatinib, as evidenced by a prior
major cytogenetic response, were to be excluded from participation in
the study.
 xxxd2724xxx  at a dose of 400 mg twice daily (800 mg/day) was administered to all patients based on safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data
from the phase 1 study.19 patients were instructed to fast for at least 2 hours
prior to and 1 hour after taking  xxxd2724xxx . in the absence of safety concerns,
 xxxd2724xxx  could be escalated to 600 mg twice daily (1200 mg/day) if patients
had not obtained a hematologic response at 3 months, a cytogenetic
response at 6 months, a major cytogenetic response at 12 months, or if they
showed loss of hematologic or cytogenetic response or disease progression
at any time. hematologic and cytogenetic response criteria have been
described previously.22 cytogenetic responses are as follows: complete, ph
positivity of 0%; partial, ph positivity of 1% to 35%; minor, ph positivity of
36% to 65%; and minimal, ph positivity of 66% to 95%. a major
cytogenetic response includes complete and partial cytogenetic responses.
cytogenetic responses were based on the percentage of ph⫹ metaphases

peripheral blood samples were obtained prior to the first dose of  xxxd2724xxx .
the total blood rna was reversely transcribed and amplified by nested
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using primers located in the bcr and  xxxg23xxx 
regions of the bcr- xxxg23xxx  gene. the amplicons that extend over the entire
bcr- xxxg23xxx   xxxg2198xxx  domain (ranging from amino acid 230-490;
genbank accession no. m14752) and the surrounding regions, were then
screened for mutations by direct sequencing technology. this bcr- xxxg23xxx 
mutation analysis was performed by 5 regional academic laboratories. all
5 laboratories reported reliable detection of mutant clones present at a
frequency of 20% or higher.
statistical considerations
the primary efficacy variable of this study was the overall major
cytogenetic response. secondary efficacy variables included time to major
cytogenetic response, duration of major cytogenetic response, chr, time to
and duration of chr, and overall survival. response rates were calculated
as percentages relative to the respective patient populations. for major
cytogenetic response and chr, 95% confidence intervals (cis) using
clopper-pearson limits were determined. time-to-event variables were
summarized and are presented using the kaplan-meier method. a fleming
single-stage design was used to test the null hypothesis that the rate of major
(complete ⫹ partial) cytogenetic response was 10% or less, versus the
alternative hypothesis that the true response rate was 20% or more.
a minimum of 132 patients were required (assuming a one-sided p ⫽ .025;
power 0.90). a response rate of 21 or more out of 132 would be sufficient to
reject the null hypothesis. because of the activity of the agent, overenrollment on the study was allowed to offer more patients in need of alternative
options after imatinib failure access to  xxxd2724xxx  therapy.

results
a total of 318 patients were enrolled in the study between april
2005 and august 2006, and were treated at 63 centers from
15 countries. results are presented for the initial cohort of
280 patients with at least 6 months of follow-up or those who
prematurely discontinued study treatment. patient characteristics
are shown in table 1. their median age was 58 years (range, 21 to
85 years). patients had received extensive prior therapy: 66% had
received interferon-␣, 83% had received hydroxyurea, and 25%
had received  xxxd1790xxx . the median duration of cml was

57 months; the median duration of prior imatinib therapy was
32 months. a total of 194 (69%) patients had imatinib resistance,
and 86 (31%) patients had imatinib intolerance.
the median cumulative duration of  xxxd2724xxx  dose interruptions
was low (18 days; range, 1-185 days) relative to the median
duration of therapy (261 days; range, 1-502 days). the median
duration of exposure for the 318 patients enrolled was 245 days.
the median dose intensity of  xxxd2724xxx  was 797 mg/day (range,
151-1112 mg/day), very close to the intended total daily  xxxd2724xxx 
dose of 800 mg per day.
as of september 2006, 183 (65%) patients remain on study.
reasons for discontinuation, regardless of causality, included
adverse events in 42 (15%) patients, disease progression in
32 (11%) patients, consent withdrawal in 10 (4%) patients, and
other reasons in 4% (including abnormal laboratory test [n ⫽ 5],
death [n ⫽ 2], administrative problems [n ⫽ 3], loss of follow-up
[n ⫽ 1], and protocol violations [n ⫽ 3]). a total of 17 (6%)
patients required discontinuation from study for cytopenia (neutropenia in 9 patients, thrombocytopenia in 8 patients).
efficacy

overall, a major cytogenetic response was achieved in 134 of
280 patients (48%; 95% ci, 41.9%-53.9%). table 2 details the

response rates. rates of major cytogenetic response were 48%
(95% ci, 41.2%-55.7%) in patients with imatinib intolerance and
47% (95% ci, 35.7%-57.6%) in patients with imatinib resistance.
complete cytogenetic response was achieved in 88 patients (31%;
95% ci, 26.0%-37.2%). a total of 30 of the 134 patients with major
cytogenetic response were categorized based only on fish evaluations (12 complete cytogenetic responses, 18 partial cytogenetic
responses). while there is excellent concordance between conventional and fish analyses in patients achieving complete cytogenetic response, the concordance rate for partial cytogenetic response is good. if the 18 partial cytogenetic responses are not
considered, 116 (41%) of 280 patients would be considered to have
achieved a major cytogenetic response with  xxxd2724xxx  therapy. in
addition, 5 patients entered the study with a complete cytogenetic
response and maintained their response in the study; another
3 patients entered the study in partial cytogenetic response and also
maintained their response in the study; and 3 patients had missing
baseline assessment but achieved complete cytogenetic response
during the study. therefore, another 11 (4%) patients had documentation of major cytogenetic response during the study. the median
time to major cytogenetic response was 2.8 months. among
patients achieving major cytogenetic response, 96% continued on
 xxxd2724xxx  without progression or death for at least 6 months from the
date of achieving their response (figure 1). only 5 (4%) patients in
major cytogenetic response discontinued  xxxd2724xxx  due to progression or death (figure 1). a further 16 (12%) patients in major
cytogenetic response lost their major cytogenetic response but were
still on treatment at data cut-off. the estimated 12-month overall
survival rate was 95% (figure 2). a chr, assessable in 185 patients without chr at baseline, occurred in 74% (95% ci,
67.1%-80.2%) of patients. complete hematologic responses occurred early (median time to chr, 1 month). only 11 (8%) of the
137 patients who had achieved chr discontinued due to progression or death.
baseline assessment for the bcr- xxxg23xxx  mutation status was
available in 182 patients at the time of analysis. a total of
28 different bcr- xxxg23xxx  mutations involving 23 amino acids were
detected in 42% of the patients (77 of 182 patients), 8% of whom
(6 of 77 patients) showed more than 1 mutation. after 6 months of
therapy, major cytogenetic response was achieved in 42% of
patients and complete cytogenetic response was achieved in 23%
of patients with baseline mutations, versus in 51% and 35% of
patients without baseline mutations (table 3). among patients who
did not have chr at baseline, the rate of chr at 6 months was
61% and 83% in patients with or without baseline mutations,
respectively. major cytogenetic response and chr were observed
across all bcr- xxxg23xxx  genotypes, with the exception of the t315i

mutation identified in 4 (2.2%) of 182 patients, and the e255v and
e274k mutation each identified in 1 (0.6%) of 182 patients (table
3). however, both the e255v and e274k mutations coexisted with a
t315i mutation at baseline in these 2 patients. there were 2 patients
with a l248v mutation who were not assessable for hematologic and
cytogenetic responses.
although responses were observed broadly across the mutation
spectrum, the rate of responses appeared to be affected by the types
of mutations identified in patients and their sensitivity to  xxxd2724xxx 
as assessed in vitro. major cytogenetic response and chr were
achieved in 53% (16 of 30) and 77% (17 of 22) of patients with
mutations associated with preclinical ic50 to  xxxd2724xxx  of less than
100 nm18 (table 3; mutation group 1), in 43% (6 of 14) and 50%
(6 of 12) of patients with ic50 of 101 to 200 nm (table 3; mutation
group 2), and in 15% (2 of 13) and 18% (2 of 11) of patients with
ic50 of 201 to 800 nm (table 3; mutation group 3), respectively.
mutation group 4 (ic50 ⬎ 800 nm), which only includes t315i in
4 patients, showed no hematologic and cytogenetic responses.
safety profile

adverse events with a suspected relationship to  xxxd2724xxx  are
summarized in table 4. these were generally mild to moderate in
severity. the most commonly reported nonhematologic events
considered possibly related to  xxxd2724xxx , and of any grade severity,
were rash (28%), nausea and pruritus (24% each), and headache
and fatigue (19% each). grade 3 or 4 toxicities were noted in 3% or
less of patients (table 4). clinically notable adverse events
reported with other bcr- xxxg23xxx  inhibitors, such as pleural effusions,
pericardial effusions, pulmonary edema, and left ventricular dys-

function,23 were rarely observed with  xxxd2724xxx  (3 [1.1%] patients,
all grades 1–2).
the most commonly reported grade 3 or 4 hematologic
abnormalities were neutropenia (29%) and thrombocytopenia (29%),
with median durations of 15 and 22 days, respectively. neutropenia
and thrombocytopenia were generally manageable with dose
interruptions and reductions, which were necessitated in 10% and
19% of patients, respectively. patients only occasionally required
support with hematopoietic growth factors (5%) or platelet transfusions (10%).
the majority of serum biochemistry abnormalities observed
with  xxxd2724xxx  were mild to moderate in severity. grade 3 or
4 elevations in ast and alt occurred in 1% and 4% of patients,
respectively. grade 3 or 4 bilirubin and lipase elevations
occurred in 9% and 14% of patients, respectively. these were
self-limited and resolved spontaneously, with continuation of
 xxxd2724xxx  at the same dose, within 1 to 2 weeks. pancreatitis was
reported in 3 (1%) patients.
the nonhematologic reasons for imatinib intolerance are presented in table 5. cross-intolerance, defined as the occurrence of
any grade 3 or higher  xxxd2724xxx -induced toxicity previously reported
in the same patient receiving imatinib, was infrequent, occurring in
only 2 (2%) of 86 patients. almost all imatinib-intolerant patients
were able to tolerate therapy with  xxxd2724xxx . because of a preclinical
signal indicating that  xxxd2724xxx  could potentially prolong the qt
interval, frequent electrocardiograms were obtained during this
study and analyzed centrally. the effect of  xxxd2724xxx  at steady-state
(day 8) on the qtcf interval, measured as a time-averaged mean
change from baseline in qtcf (fridericia15 correction), was

5 milliseconds. categoric, or outlier analysis of serial electrocardiograms, measuring the number of absolute qtcf intervals exceeding
500 milliseconds, showed an incidence of 1% (3 of 280 patients).
a total of 4 deaths occurred in the study, or within 28 days of
discontinuing  xxxd2724xxx ; 1 patient had a myocardial infarction, another
died of coronary artery disease, and 2 patients died of sepsis.
overall,  xxxd2724xxx  was well tolerated as demonstrated by the
high dose intensity achieved.

discussion
 xxxd2724xxx , a highly selective and potent bcr- xxxg23xxx  inhibitor, was
very active and safe in this phase 2 study of patients with
cml-cp post-imatinib resistance and intolerance. major cytogenetic response, which correlated with long-term survival and
clinical benefit,5,6 was observed in 48% of patients. complete
cytogenetic responses were noted in 31% of patients.  xxxd1815xxx 
given to patients with cml-cp post-imatinib failure produced a

major cytogenetic response rate of 45% at 6 months, and a
complete cytogenetic response rate of 33%.11 with  xxxd2724xxx , the
estimated 1-year overall survival rate was 95% (figure 1). the
estimated percent of patients who achieved a major cytogenetic
response and who did not discontinue  xxxd2724xxx  due to progression or death for at least 6 months after achievement of response
was 96% (figure 2). similar rates of major cytogenetic response
were observed in imatinib-resistant and -intolerant patients.
this is likely due to the rigorous definition of imatinib
intolerance, which excluded imatinib-intolerant patients who
had achieved a prior major cytogenetic response (thus, the
imatinib-intolerant patients had also relatively less sensitive
disease). among the 134 of 280 patients who achieved a major
cytogenetic response, the response was documented only by
fish analysis in 30 patients (12 complete cytogenetic responses, 18 partial cytogenetic responses). excluding the
18 partial cytogenetic responses documented by fish, the major
cytogenetic response rate with  xxxd2724xxx  would be 41%.

mutations in bcr- xxxg23xxx  are a known mechanism of resistance to
imatinib. in this study, 28 different bcr- xxxg23xxx  mutations affecting
23 amino acids were noted in 42% of patients prior to  xxxd2724xxx 
therapy. chr and/or cytogenetic response (major, complete) were
observed in patients harboring a variety of bcr- xxxg23xxx  mutations
associated with imatinib resistance as well as in imatinib-resistant
patients without bcr- xxxg23xxx  mutation. the rates of major cytogenetic response at 6 months were 42% and 51% in patients with and
without baseline mutations, respectively. as predicted by preclinical data,18 none of the 4 patients with baseline t315i mutation had
either chr or major cytogenetic response during the  xxxd2724xxx 
therapy. thus,  xxxd2724xxx  was effective in patients with bcr- xxxg23xxx 
mutations, except t315i, as well as in patients with other mechanisms of resistance independent of bcr- xxxg23xxx  mutations, demonstrating its clear therapeutic role in patients with imatinib resistance.
although responses were observed in all genotypes except
t315i, patients with bcr- xxxg23xxx  mutations that showed higher in
vitro sensitivity against  xxxd2724xxx  (cellular ic50 ⱕ 200 nm)18 appeared to have better rates of response than patients with less
sensitive mutations (cellular ic50 of 201–800 nm; table 3). these
less sensitive mutant clones (described by weisberg et al18 as
having ic50 values of ⱖ 200 nm) showed complete in vitro
suppression with increased exposure of  xxxd2724xxx . with  xxxd2724xxx 
plasma peak-trough levels of 3600 to 1700 nm at a 400-mg
twice-daily dose, it is possible that longer treatment duration may
result in further improvement in clinical responses in patients with
less sensitive mutations.
in this study,  xxxd2724xxx  was rarely associated with the common
toxicities seen with imatinib (eg, fluid retention, edema, cramps,
periorbital edema, and weight gain). commonly noted side effects
included mild skin rash, headache, and nausea. serious grades 3 to
4 nonhematologic side effects were uncommon. pleural effusions,
observed in 10% to 35% of patients on dasatinib11,23 were observed
in only 1% of patients with  xxxd2724xxx  therapy. peripheral edema,
reported in 20% to 30% of patients on imatinib3,6 and in 18% of

patients on  xxxd1815xxx ,11 was rarely observed in patients on  xxxd2724xxx .
although  xxxd2724xxx  and imatinib are chemically similar, the minimal occurrence of cross-intolerance between the 2 agents represents also an interesting and important therapeutic advantage
(table 5).
with  xxxd2724xxx  therapy, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia
were modest in severity and infrequently required growth factor
support or platelet transfusions. grades 3 to 4 neutropenia and
thrombocytopenia were each reported in 29% of patients.
myelosuppression was the most common adverse event (4%)
leading to permanent  xxxd2724xxx  discontinuation. with  xxxd1815xxx ,
the rates of grades 3 to 4 neutropenia (49%) and thrombocytopenia (47%) patients with cml-cp after imatinib intolerance and
resistance were higher.11 it has been postulated that a more
potent inhibitor of bcr- xxxg23xxx  may contribute to increased myelosuppression from rapid clearance of bcr- xxxg23xxx  expressing
malignant hematopoietic cells. interestingly, despite the greater
potency of  xxxd2724xxx  relative to imatinib, the rates of grades 3 to
4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in this heavily pretreated
population were comparable with those reported in imatinibtreated patients with late cml-cp who were previously treated
with interferon-␣. thus, the selectivity of  xxxd2724xxx  against
bcr- xxxg23xxx  (relative to other targets, such as src-family or c-kit
kinases) may account for the high level of efficacy unaccompanied by higher rates of severe myelosuppression.  xxxd2724xxx  was
well tolerated in this study as demonstrated by the high dose
intensity achieved. in contrast, the median dose delivered in the
 xxxd1815xxx  studies was about two-thirds of the intended dose
(median daily dose delivered was 101 mg; the intended daily
dose was 140 mg).11
drug-induced effects on the qt interval are often difficult to
accurately assess in patients given the inherent variability around
this parameter and the lack of available age- and disease-matched
controls providing information on the background incidence of
these findings in similar populations. the qt interval results
observed in this study were consistent with those observed in
similar imatinib-resistant and -intolerant patients with cml treated
with  xxxd1815xxx  (pooled analysis of 5 cml studies showed a mean
change from baseline in qtcf of 3 to 6 milliseconds; qtcf interval
of more than 500 milliseconds observed in 0.7% of patients).
clinically significant abnormalities in nonhematologic laboratory parameters were infrequent. the most commonly observed
biochemical abnormality was hyperbilirubinemia, followed by
transient elevations in alt, ast, and serum lipase. indirect
hyperbilirubinemia, mostly grade 2 or lower severity, was selflimited and reversed spontaneously with continued  xxxd2724xxx  therapy
at the same dose. the etiology of hyperbilirubinemia was explored
by examining polymorphisms in the  xxxd3476xxx  glucuronosyltransferase 1a1 ( xxxg2379xxx   xxxg2380xxx   xxxg2381xxx   xxxg2383xxx   xxxg2384xxx ) gene in 62 patients in the study.
results suggested that the ta repeat polymorphism in  xxxg2379xxx   xxxg2380xxx   xxxg2381xxx   xxxg2383xxx   xxxg2384xxx ,
which predisposes to gilbert syndrome, predicted for the susceptibility to  xxxd2724xxx -induced hyperbilirubinemia. therefore, it appears
that the administration of  xxxd2724xxx  unmasked a clinically benign
form of indirect hyperbilirubinemia, which was self-limited, resolving with continued therapy.
in summary,  xxxd2724xxx  is highly active and safe, and provides an
alternative effective treatment for patients whose disease becomes
resistant or intolerant to imatinib.  xxxd2724xxx  is also being studied in
newly diagnosed cml, where the goal is to prevent the emergence
of mutant clones, which may confer clinical benefit over that of the
current standard of care, imatinib.
