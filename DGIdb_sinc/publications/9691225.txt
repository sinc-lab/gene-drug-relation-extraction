we studied the oral actions of antihistamines from six chemical classes,
namely: the ethanolamines (ena, diphenhydramine and clemastine); ethylenediamines (eda,  xxxd3050xxx  and  xxxd3443xxx ); piperidines (ppd,
terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx ); piperazines (ppz, hydroxyzine and cetirizine); phenothiazines (ptz, promethazine), and the alkylamines (ala,
chlorpheniramine and  xxxd375xxx ) on cough reflexes, pentobarbital-induced sedation and minute ventilation in the conscious guinea pig.
antihistamines of the ena class had minimal effects on capsaicininduced cough although both diphenhydramine (30 and 100 mg/kg p.o.)
and clemastine (30 and 100 mg/kg p.o.) increased sedation time (st). the
ppz class demonstrated both antitussive and sedating activity. the minimum effective oral antitussive dose (med) of cetirizine and hydroxyzine
was 30 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. the eda did not exhibit antitussive
activity.  xxxd3443xxx  (10, 30 and 100 mg/kg p.o.) but not  xxxd3050xxx 
enhanced st. the med for the ptz, promethazine, was 10 mg/kg, and at
100 mg/kg promethazine increased st. the ala group displayed antitussive activity but only chlorpheniramine (10 mg/kg p.o.) had any effects on
st. the med for chlorpheniramine and  xxxd375xxx  was 3 and
10 mg/kg p.o., respectively. the ppd antihistamines, namely terfenadine
and  xxxd236xxx , inhibited cough (med 30 and 10 mg/kg p.o.) without sedative effects. of the antihistamines tested only promethazine (100 mg/kg
p.o.) depressed ventilation responses; however, this dose of promethazine
was associated with adverse behavioral effects. the present findings indicate that the antitussive actions of antihistamines are not directly related
to histamine h1-receptor blockade because several antihistamines did not
antagonize capsaicin-induced cough. in addition, the antitussive actions
of antihistamines are independent of their sedative or ventilation effects.

introduction
cough is a powerful respiratory defense
mechanism that results in the expulsion of
irritants from the airways. it can be presented
as a prominent symptom associated with
many pulmonary diseases including asthma,
pulmonary infections, post-nasal drip syndrome, chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [1–3] and extrapulmonary conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux [4]. treatment options are complicated by the determination of whether the
cough is mainly productive or nonproductive.
current pharmacological treatment for nonproductive cough is limited. local anesthetics
such as  xxxd305xxx  and  xxxd308xxx  act peripherally by blocking sensory nerve transmission from stretch receptors located in the
respiratory passages, lungs and pleura [5]. the
opiates, such as codeine and dextromethorphan, are the most studied of the antitussive
drugs. historically, these drugs have been reported to exert their antitussive actions via
central mechanisms. more recent evidence,
however, has suggested that these drugs may
also have peripheral actions [6].
histamine  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists have
been shown to have antitussive actions [7]. in
fact, many antitussive preparations like phenergan® and tussionex® contain as one of
their main ingredients antihistamines, like
chlorpheniramine and promethazine. firstgeneration antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine and promethazine, readily cross the
blood brain barrier to produce sedation in
man [5]. there is a general acceptance that the
antitussive activity of antihistamines is indirect, perhaps, through cns inhibitory actions
[8]. the cns-depressive effects of first-generation antihistamines may diminish respiratory reflexes thereby attenuating cough responses. in addition, blockade of other receptors, like muscarinic or serotinergic receptors,

58

pharmacology 1998;57:57–64

may also contribute to the antitussive actions
of these drugs. recent studies have shown
that newer nonsedating, second-generation
antihistamines, like terfenadine, attenuate
cough reflexes in man [9]. bolser et al. [10]
showed that loratadine, a second-generation
antihistamine that does not penetrate into the
cns, diminishes cough both in allergic and
capsaicin-induced guinea-pig cough models.
in contrast, studham and fuller [8] did not
demonstrate any effects of terfenadine on capsaicin-induced cough in humans. despite the
widespread use of antihistamines, the pharmacology of their antitussive actions remains
to be fully elucidated.
in the current studies we evaluated the
antitussive actions of several different chemical classes of antihistamines (both first-generation sedating and second-generation nonsedating) in the guinea pig. we speculated that
the antitussive potential of a variety of structurally different antihistamines would be
comparable to their sedation potential. therefore we also evaluated the sedative and potential respiratory effects of these drugs. this
study represents the first comprehensive
pharmacological investigation on the relationship between the antitussive, sedative and
ventilatory activity of histamine h1 antagonists.

ea pig according to the methods of bolser et al. [10].
this model is a widely used method to evaluate the
activity of potential antitussive drugs. overnight
fasted male hartley guinea pigs (350–450 g, charles
river, bloomington, mass., usa) were placed in a
12 ! 14 inch transparent chamber. the animals were
exposed to aerosolized capsaicin (300 ìmol/l, for
4 min) produced by a jet nebulizer (puritan bennett,
lenexa, kans., usa) to elicit the cough reflex. each
guinea pig was exposed only once to capsaicin. the
number of coughs were detected by a microphone
placed in the chamber and verified by a trained observer. the signal from the microphone was relayed to a
polygraph which provided a record of the number of
coughs. either vehicle ( xxxd2609xxx  1 ml/kg p.o.) or
 xxxd3443xxx  (3–100 mg/kg p.o.),  xxxd3050xxx  (3–
100 mg/kg p.o.), diphenhydramine (10–100 mg/kg
p.o.), clemastine (10–100 mg/kg p.o.), promethazine
(3–100 mg/kg p.o.), terfenadine (3–100 mg/kg p.o.),  xxxd236xxx  (3–100 mg/kg p.o.), chlorpheniramine (0.3–
10 mg/kg p.o.),  xxxd375xxx  (0.3–10 mg/kg
p.o.), hydroxyzine (3–100 mg/kg p.o.) or cetirizine (3–
100 mg/kg p.o.) were given 1 h before aerosolized capsaicin. the antitussive activity of codeine (3–30 mg/kg
p.o.) was tested as a positive control.

ventilation studies
the effects of a single high dose (100 mg/kg p.o.) of
 xxxd3050xxx , diphenhydramine, terfenadine, promethazine, chlorpheniramine and cetirizine was studied on
ventilation responses to breathing room air or a hypercapnic air mixture. the gabab agonist, baclofen (10–
100 mg/kg p.o.) which has been shown to depress minute ventilation on conscious gunea pigs [12], was tested
as a positive control. to evaluate the effects on ventilation, fasted male hartley guinea pigs (350–450 g,
charles river) were placed in a whole body plethysmograph [13]. pressure fluctuations within the plethysmograph, a measure of tidal volume (vt) were measured
by a pressure transducer connected to a port located on
the wall of the plethysmograph. respiratory rates (f)
were derived from the pressure tracing that was recorded on a chart recorder. minute ventilation (v) was calculated from the relationship, vt ! f. to determine
the effects of treatment on maximum respiratory responses, hyperpnea was induced by administration of
a hypercapnic gas mixture (10% co2, 21% o2 and
69% n2). the hypercapnic gas mixture was given at a
rate of 40 ml/s through a head piece that was attached
to the plethsmograph over the head of the animal. animals were pretreated for 60 min.

potentiation of pentobarbital-induced loss of
righting reflex
the potential sedative activity of antihistamines
were evaluated by methods according to kalivas [11].
this model is useful in evaluating alterations in arousal states produced by antihistamines. overnight fasted
male hartley guinea pigs (350–450 g, charles river)
were administered either vehicle ( xxxd2609xxx 
1 ml/kg p.o.),  xxxd3443xxx  (10–100 mg/kg p.o.),  xxxd3050xxx  (10–100 mg/kg p.o.), diphenhydramine (10–
100 mg/kg p.o.), clemastine (10–100 mg/kg p.o.),
promethazine (3–100 mg/kg p.o.), terfenadine (10–
100 mg/kg p.o.),  xxxd236xxx  (10–100 mg/kg p.o.),
chlorpheniramine (1–10 mg/kg p.o.),  xxxd375xxx  (1–10 mg/kg p.o.), hydroxyzine (10–100 mg/kg
p.o.) or cetirizine (10–100 mg/kg p.o.) 30 min before
giving pentobarbital (18 mg/kg i.p.). the dose of pentobarbital was chosen based on its ability to reproducibly produce sleep times ranging from 83 to 102 min.
the onset of sedation was defined as the time between
administration of pentobarbital and loss of the righting
reflex (ability of the guinea pig to right itself three
times in a 1-min period) expressed in minutes. sleep
duration was defined as the time between the loss and
the recovery of the righting reflex measured in minutes.

drugs
 xxxd3443xxx  hydrochloride,  xxxd3050xxx  maleate,  xxxd1906xxx , clemastine fumarate, hydroxyzine hydrochloride,  xxxd3050xxx  maleate, baclofen, codeine and promethazine hydrochloride were purchased from sigma chemical co. (st.
louis, mo., usa). terfenadine,  xxxd236xxx , cetirizine
hydrochloride, chlorpheniramine maleate and  xxxd375xxx  hydrochloride were synthesized at schering plough research institute. all drugs were dissolved
in a 0.4%  xxxd2609xxx  and saline suspension. drug
doses refer to their respective free bases.

effects of antihistamines on cough
in control animals, capsaicin (300 ìmol/l)
produced 2.5 b 0.1 coughs/min (table 1).
this value represents all control animals
pooled (n = 105). terfenadine (30–100 mg/kg
p.o.) and  xxxd236xxx  (10–100 mg/kg p.o.) attenuated the number of coughs produced by
capsaicin. the minimum effective antitussive
dose (med) was 30 mg/kg p.o. for terfenadine
and 10 mg/kg p.o. for  xxxd236xxx . the ppz,
cetirizine and hydroxyzine, and both ala,
chlorpheniramine and  xxxd375xxx ,
decreased the number of coughs produced by
aerosolized capsaicin. the med for cetirizine
and hydroxyzine was 30 and 10 mg/kg p.o.,
and for chlorpheniramine and  xxxd375xxx  it was 3 and 10 mg/kg, respectively.
the ena, clemastine (3–100 mg/kg p.o.), was
without effect on capsaicin-induced cough;
however, diphenhydramine inhibited capsaicin-induced cough reflexes at 30 mg/kg. the
eda,  xxxd3443xxx  and  xxxd3050xxx , at
doses up to 100 mg/kg p.o. displayed no antitussive activity. promethazine produced antitussive effects  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg p.o. (med). in separate studies, codeine (30 and 100 mg/kg p.o.;
n = 6–12/group) significantly decreased the
number of coughs/min produced by capsaicin
to 1.1 b 0.2 and 1.3 b 0.2, respectively (data
not shown). the oral med for codeine was
30 mg/kg.
effects of antihistamines on
pentobarbital-induced sedation
the ppd antihistamines, terfenadine and
 xxxd236xxx , had no effects on pentobarbitalinduced sedation time (st; table 2). hydroxyzine (30 and 100 mg/kg p.o.) enhanced st by
43 and 66%. cetirizine (30 and 100 mg/kg
p.o.) increased st by 82 and 143%. similarly,
antihistamines from the ena class also had
sedative activity. diphenhydramine (30 and

100 mg/kg p.o.) increased st by 45 and 47%.
clemastine (30 and 100 mg/kg p.o.) increased
pentobarbital-induced st by 37 and 105%.
from the eda class,  xxxd3443xxx  (10–
100 mg/kg p.o.) but not  xxxd3050xxx  (10–
100 mg/kg p.o.) increased sedation. the ala,
chlorpheniramine (10 mg/kg p.o.), and ptz,
promethazine (100 mg/kg p.o.), also had sedative activity.
effects of antihistamines on ventilation
table 3 shows the respiratory-depressant
effect of baclofen on minute ventilation in the
guinea pig. the data are presented as percent
change from baseline. baseline ventilation parameters were not different between groups.
neither  xxxd3050xxx , diphenhydramine, terfenadine, or cetirizine at 100 mg/kg p.o. had
any statistically significant effect on ventilation. chlorpheniramine (10 mg/kg p.o.), a
dose that produced maximum antitussive activity, also had no effects on ventilation.
promethazine (100 mg/kg p.o.) decreased hyperventilation responses produced with a hypercapnic gas mixture. however, this dose of
promethazine was also associated with ataxia.
promethazine given at 30 mg/kg p.o., a dose
that produced significant antitussive activity,
did not affect ventilatory parameters.

discussion
antihistamines are indicated and widely
used for the management of allergic diseases
[14–20]. in addition to their antiallergic effects some antihistamines also demonstrate
antitussive activity in a variety of experimental cough models including the irritant capsaicin-induced cough used in the present studies
[7, 9, 10, 21–23]. the antitussive actions of
these drugs are observed at doses greater than
the antihistamine activity. for example, tozzi et al. [24] reported that the oral ed50 for

chlorpheniramine, promethazine and diphenhydramine against histamine-induced anaphylaxis in guinea pigs was 0.1, 0.2 and
4.0 mg/kg, respectively. in the current study,
the med for these three drugs were 3, 10 and
30 mg/kg, respectively.
the mechanism responsible for the antitussive actions of these antihistamines remains to be elucidated. earlier reports suggested that the actions of these drugs maybe
related to their sedative proclivity [8, 21].
however, using an irritant cough model [10]
and a pentobarbital-induced sedative model
that is sensitive to the actions of antihistamines on arousal states [11], our results indicate that the antitussive activity displayed by
some antihistamines is independent of their
potential sedative activity. the findings presented here are in agreement with studies by
rafferty et al. [9] and bolser et al. [10] who
showed that nonsedating antihistamines, like
terfenadine and loratadine, exhibit antitussive activity. our results extend the observation to include  xxxd236xxx  which is also nonsedating antihistamine and, like terfenadine, is
a ppd. similarly, the ala also inhibited cap-

class

saicin-induced coughs with minimum sedative effects. further support for the argument
that h1 antagonists produce sedation and diminish cough reflexes by separate mechanisms is provided by the observation that
some antihistamines, like clemastine and  xxxd3443xxx , displayed sedative activity but
were devoid of antitussive activity. we also
found that neither the ppd nor the ala
altered minute ventilation while breathing
room air or hyperventilation responses due to
breathing a hypercapnic air mixture, indicating that these drugs are devoid of respiratorydepressant effects. in contrast to the antitussive profile and the lack of ventilatory effects
observed with antihistamines, other drugs,
like the  xxxg828xxx  agonist, baclofen,
decreased ventilation parameters and inhibited cough reflexes [25, 26].
our studies suggest that the antitussive actions of antihistamines appear to be restricted
to specific chemical classes. we found that
drugs from the ppz, ala, ppd and the ptz
inhibited cough reflexes in the guinea pig. in
contrast, the eda and ena, with the exception of diphenhydramine, as a group were not

effective as antitussive agents. other reports
also indicate that the antitussive actions of
some antihistamines may be dependent on
their chemical class. silvestrini and mattii
[27] and kase and yuizono [28] were not able
to attribute any antitussive actions to the
eda,  xxxd3050xxx . boissier and pagny [29]
also demonstrated no antitussive effects of
eda at doses of 25 mg/kg i.p. in guinea pigs.
on the other hand, chappel et al. [30] showed
that ptz derivatives inhibited cough in animals. furthermore,  xxxd1667xxx  and oxatomide, antihistamines of the ppz class, have
also been shown to inhibit cough in the guinea
pig elicited by inhalation of ammonia and  xxxd1710xxx  [23, 31].
in the present studies we did not address
whether other receptor types contribute to the
antitussive effects of these antihistamines.

their effects do not appear to be related to
their histamine h1-receptor-blocking activities. however, we cannot rule out the possibility that the antitussive actions of these drugs
are in part due to blockade of other receptors
like muscarinic, serotonergic [8] or tachykinins [32]. for example, classical, first-generation antihistamines produce side effects related to cholinergic, serotonergic and adrenergic blockade [9].
in summary, certain classes of antihistamines, like the ppd, attenuate capsaicininduced cough in the guinea pig through actions unrelated to blockade of peripheral histamine h1 receptors. the antitussive actions
of these drugs appear to be mediated at least
in part by a peripheral mechanism that is
independent of cns-depressive, sedative or
ventilation effects.
