abstract
plants of nymphaea alba l. grown at various levels of chromium (vi) ranging from 1 to 200 lm accumulated
chromium in concentration and duration-dependent manner. at all cr levels, chromium accumulation by various plant
tissues followed the order roots > leaves > rhizomes. approximately 93% of total chromium present in the medium was
accumulated by plants at lowest conentration (1 lm) used in the experiment. chromium-induced toxicity appears at 1
lm chromium resulting in the build-up of d- xxxd148xxx  (ala) and reduced activities of d- xxxd148xxx 
dehydratase ( xxxg121xxx ) and nitrate reductase (nr), total chlorophyll (chl) and protein contents. chl a was more sensitive
than chl b to chromium toxicity. it could be inferred that chromium toxicity is not located at the level of ala synthesis, but, probably at the  xxxg121xxx  activity which was more severely aected during chlorophyll biosynthesis. finally,
impaired chlorophyll biosynthesis resulted in reduced total chlorophyll content. ó 2000 elsevier science ltd. all rights

1. introduction
chromium is a major metal pollutant of aquatic
bodies which is released mainly from leather tanning,
textile, carpet and electroplating industries. usually,
chromium occurs in two forms; cr (iii) and cr (vi) and
both forms are taken up by plants. cr (iii) is sparingly
soluble and less toxic, while cr (vi) being more soluble
in water, is highly toxic to biota (nieboer and richardson, 1980). aquatic macrophytes inhabiting chromium polluted water bodies have been found to
accumulate chromium to varying extent in dierent
plant parts (mangi et al., 1978; smith et al., 1989; rai
et al., 1995). chromium interferes with several metabolic
processes, causing toxicity to the plants as exhibited by

reduced root growth and phytomass, chlorosis, photosynthetic impairing, stunting and ®nally plant death
(mcgrath, 1982; satyakala and jamil, 1992; sinha et al.,
1993; gaur et al., 1994; sharma et al., 1995). synthesis
of d- xxxd148xxx  (ala) is the ®rst identi®ed step
in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, leading to the formation of
heme, chlorophyll, billins,  xxxd2716xxx  and specialized
products (garnick and sassa, 1971). ala synthetic
ability plays a key role in the regulation of chlorophyll
biosynthesis in higher plants (bogorad, 1976; beale,
1978). however, naito et al. (1980) suggested that
chlorophyll biosynthesis might be regulated not only by
ala synthetic ability but also by d- xxxd148xxx 
dehydratase ( xxxg121xxx ) activity. altered  xxxg121xxx  activity
concomitant with reduced chlorophyll content has been
reported in many terrestrial plants exposed to various
concentrations of lead, cadmium and mercury (stobart
et al., 1985; prasad and prasad, 1987a,b). nitrate reductase (nr) is a rate limiting enzyme and was found to be
aected with chromium (vajpayee et al., 1999). however,

very little is known about the eect of chromium on nr
activity, the nature of inhibition and the relationship
with chlorophyll biosynthesis in rooted aquatic macrophytes with ¯oating foliage. rooted aquatic macrophytes with ¯oating leaves play a key role in the aquatic
ecosystems as their root binding (roots/rhizomes) helps
reduce soil erosion and also facilitates colonisation by
benthic algae and invertebrates (sculthorpe, 1967). but,
they have been less frequently used by the scientists for
phytotoxicity experiments (aulio, 1980; roy et al., 1992;
franco et al., 1993; vajpayee et al., 1999).
although, nymphaea alba l. a commonly occurring
rooted plant with ¯oating foliage, possesses a great potential to ameliorate cr levels from raw tannery euent
containing elevated chromium concentrations (vajpayee
et al., 1995), it has not been studied for chromium induced biochemical changes. present paper reports the
results of a study conducted to estimate the toxic eects
of chromium on ala level,  xxxg121xxx  activity, chlorophylls, nr activity and protein content in n. alba.
2. materials and methods
young plants of n. alba were raised from the rhizomes of mother plants growing in hydroponic cultures
at the environmental botany laboratory, national
botanical research institute, lucknow. plants of same
age, weighing approximately 2.0 g, were selected for
experiments. various concentrations (1, 10, 20, 40, 100,
200 lm) of cr (vi), were prepared by adding the required aliquots of 1000 lm stock solution of k2 cr2 o7
to the 5% hoagland solution. two plants were transferred to a 2000 ml beaker containing 1000 ml chromium-supplemented medium. three sets, each of the six
concentrations were placed separately in a growth
chamber under similar conditions (light: dark cycle
14:10 h, temperature 28  2°c, 115 lmol mÿ2 sÿ1 illumination was provided through day ¯uorescent tube
light). plants placed in 5% hoagland solution without
chromium served as a control. experimental beakers
were shaken as usual (vajpayee et al., 1999). one set of
each concentration and control was harvested after 4, 8
and 12 d of the treatment and washed three times with
double distilled water. the oven-dried (80°c) plant tissues (leaves, rhizomes and roots) of treated and control
plants were digested in hno3 :hclo4 (3:1, v/v) mixture
at 80°c and chromium concentration was estimated by a
¯ame atomic absorption spectrophotometer (perkinelmer 2380). chromium was below the detection limit in
the control samples.
ala from the excised leaf tissue (0.2 g) was extracted
in 1.0 ml 10% trichloroacetic acid at 100°c for 15 min
(miller et al., 1979). the extract was ®ltered through
cotton wool and the residue was washed with double
distilled water. the ®ltrates were combined and 2.0 ml of

0.2 m sodium phosphate buer (ph, 6.8) was added to
the extract. after addition of two drops of acetyl acetone, samples were heated for 15 min at 100°c. one ml
of the solution was added to equal volume of ehrlichõs
reagent (mauzerall and granick, 1956). samples were
shaken and allowed to remain at room temperature for
15 min. the absorbance of the samples at 553 nm was
measured on spectrophotometer (milton roy spectronic 1201). the concentration of ala was determined
(stobart et al., 1985) and contents are expressed as lmol
gÿ1 fresh weight.
 xxxg121xxx  extraction in laminae was carried out according to the method described by naito et al. (1980).
leaf tissue (2.5 g) was homogenised in 0.05 m tris-hcl
buer (ph, 8.2) containing 0.1 mm dithiotheritol (dtt,
0.5 ml gÿ1 fresh weight) in a pre-chilled mortar and
pestle. the homogenate was ®ltered through four layers
of cheese cloth and the ®ltrate was centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx  000
g for 1 h at 4°c. the supernatant was assayed for
 xxxg121xxx  activity according to the method of schneider
(1970). one ml of enzyme extract was incubated with
0.27 ml of 1 mg mlÿ1 ala, 1.35 ml of 0.05 m tris-hcl
buer (ph, 8.2) containing 0.1 mm dtt and 0.08 ml of
0.2 m mgcl2 for 2.5 h at 37°c. the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.3 ml 3.0 m tca. after
cooling, samples were centrifuged at 2000 g for 10 min.
the supernatant was mixed (1:1) with ehrlichõs reagent
and absorbance of the mixture was determined at 555
nm after 10 min against zero time blank. the concentration of porphobilinogen (pbg) was calculated according to mauzerall and granick (1956) and the
 xxxg121xxx  activity is expressed as nmol of pbg formed/mg
protein/2.5 h at 37°c.
in vivo nr activity was assayed in leaves by the
method of srivastava (1974). the excised leaf tissue (0.5
g) was incubated in 10 ml reaction mixture containing 50
mm phosphate buer (ph, 7.5), 10 mm of kno3 and
0.5%  xxxd3026xxx  (v/v). the samples were vacuum in®ltered in a dessicator and incubated in the dark at 30°c
for 30 min. the mixture was boiled in water bath and
the concentration of noÿ
2 formed was estimated by
adding 1.0 ml of 1% sulphanilamide in 1 n hcl (w/v)
and 1.0 ml of 0.02% naphthyle ethylene diamine dihydrochloride (w/v) to 1 ml aliquot of the above mixture.
after centrifugation for 15 min (10 000 g), the absorbance of supernatant was read at 540 nm. nr activity
ÿ1
was calculated as nmol noÿ
fw hÿ1 . photosyn2 g
thetic pigments were extracted in 80% chilled acetone as
per the procedure of arnon (1949). protein contents in
various tissues were estimated by the method of lowry
et al. (1951) using bsa as a standard.
a two-factorial anova in complete randomised
block design was used to con®rm the validity of data.
comparison from control and between the means of
treatment was done by duncanõs multiple range test
(gomez and gomez, 1984).

3. results
although chromium accumulation by plants was
found to be concentration- and duration-dependent
(anova, p < 0.05), maximum chromium removing
potential by n. alba was observed at 1 lm chromium
concentration (92.81% of chromium of the growth medium was accumulated in plants tissues). the amount of
chromium accumulated by various plant tissues
(roots > leaves > rhizomes) varied signi®cantly (anova, p < 0.05); leaves accumulated 2233 lg gÿ1 dw
chromium after 12 d exposure at 200 lm while roots
accumulated 4097 lg gÿ1 dw chromium for the same
exposure concentration.
at the same concentration and duration of exposure,
maximum concentration of cr in rhizomes of n. alba
was 200 lg gÿ1 dw (table 1). it was observed that elevated chromium concentrations (10 lm and onwards)
caused enhancement of ala levels (fig. 1). the ala
build up due to chromium toxicity was concentration
and duration dependent, and after 12 d treatment by 200
lm cr resulted in ca. 18-fold accumulation of ala.
a concentration and duration-dependent inhibition
of  xxxg121xxx  activity caused by enhanced chromium levels
in growth medium was recorded (fig. 2). a maximum of
62% depletion in  xxxg121xxx  activity was recorded at 200
lm chromium. results also indicated that total chlo-

rophyll content increased with age in both control and
plants treated with 1 lm chromium (p > 0.05). however, a signi®cant concentration and duration-dependent
chromium toxicity to chlorophyll content was evident at
10 lm chromium concentration (p < 0.05). a decline in
both chl a and chl b contents was observed at this
concentration which was found to increase with enhanced chromium levels and treatment duration. chlorophyll a was found to be more sensitive to chromium

protein content was signi®cant only  xxxd1891xxx  lm concentration and increased with elevation in chromium concentration and duration. the most severely aected
plant part was root, where reduction (89%) in protein
content was maximum followed by leaves (78%) and
rhizomes (53%). it was observed after 12 d treatment by
200 lm chromium.
similarly, chromium levels above 1 lm impaired nr
activity. depletion in nr activity was found to be
positively correlated with chromium concentration in
the medium and exposure duration. maximum inhibition (68%) of nr activity was recorded at 200 lm level
of cr after 12 d treatment (fig. 3).
4. discussion
results indicated that plants could tolerate chromium up to 1 lm as no toxicity was recorded at this
concentration. this is in agreement with the reports of
earlier workers who reported that aquatic plants tend to
adapt themselves to cope-up with chromium toxicity
(mangi et al., 1978; staves and knaus, 1985; gupta
et al., 1994; garg and chandra, 1994). lower concen-

tration (1 lm) facilitates the chromium accumulation
and maximum removal of chromium (92.81%) was exhibited at this level. this conforms our earlier ®nding
with n. alba which suggested the suitability of this plant
for bioremediation of euent, having low level of
chromium (vajpayee et al., 1995).
the metal uptake ability of dierent plant tissues of
aquatic macrophytes varied with species. bacopa monnieri l. and scirpus lacaustris l. have been reported to
accumulate more chromium in roots than shoots (gupta
et al., 1994). similarly, underground part of typha latifolia accumulated more chromium than aerial parts,
whereas, in phragmitis australis higher concentrations of
chromium were present in aerial parts under the same
experimental conditions (baudo et al., 1985). the observations of the present study support earlier reports.
signi®cant (p < 0.05) variation in chromium content of
dierent plant parts of n. alba (roots > leaves > rhizomes) was recorded. comparatively lower concentration of cr in the leaves compared to roots was probably
due to reduction of cr (vi) to cr (iii), which reduces its
mobility from roots to shoots (sen et al., 1987). cr (iii)
forms complexes with ±cooh groups which inhibit the
translocation of metal from root to shoot (siegel, 1973).

inhibition of chlorophyll biosynthesis is reported in
terrestrial plants under metal stress (pb, hg and cd).
this is due to reduced  xxxg121xxx  activity (stobart et al.,
1985; prasad and prasad, 1987a; padmaja et al., 1990).
our results revealed that chromium treatment above
1 lm inhibited  xxxg121xxx  activity, increased ala levels and
decreased chlorophyll contents of n. alba. depletion in
chlorophyll content of chromium-treated plants might
be attributed to reduced  xxxg121xxx  activity, which results in
lesser availability of pbg required for chlorophyll biosynthesis (prasad and prasad, 1987a,b). decreased total
chlorophyll contents showed a positive correlation with
reduced  xxxg121xxx  activity as reported earlier (shibata and
ochiai, 1976). the enhanced ala level in treated plants
may be ascribed to depleted  xxxg121xxx  activity as ala is
an intermediate of chlorophyll biosynthesis and is substrate for  xxxg121xxx  activity. pbg is formed by condensation of two molecules of ala and eight molecules of
ala are required for each tetrapyrrole synthesis (beale,
1978). results suggest that ala synthesis is not sensitive to chromium toxicity. however, the later event of
chlorophyll biosynthesis, i.e., pbg formation catalysed
by  xxxg121xxx  is highly sensitive to chromium. it appears
that chromium toxicity on  xxxg121xxx  has aected substrate
(ala) utilization resulting in the build up of ala and
®nally reduced the levels of chlorophyll.  xxxg121xxx  is a
metalloenzyme (chen and nelands, 1973) and its activity in plants is dependent on availability of mg. therefore, chromium may also reduce  xxxg121xxx  activity by
exchanging the metal at the active site. besides, cr (vi)
also causes fe de®ciency, leading to interrupted chlorophyll biosynthesis (barcelo et al., 1985).
results showed a marked decline in both chl a and
chl b contents. similar results were demonstrated in

lemna minor l. due to increase of chromate (cro2ÿ
4 ) in
nutrient medium (baszynski et al., 1981). during the
present study, chl a was found to be more severely affected. jana and chaudhari (1982) suggested that toxicity of metals to chl a and chl b in aquatic plants was
metal and species speci®c.
increased concentration of chromium and duration
of exposure signi®cantly inhibited the nr activity and
protein content of n. alba. our results are in agreement
with earlier reports on cr (vi) toxicity to chlorophyll,
nr activity and protein content in chlorococcalean
green alga and giant duck weed (rai et al., 1992;
tripathi and smith, 1996). during present study a
positive correlation between decreased chlorophyll
content and nr activity was recorded. a close relationship between photosynthesis and nr induction in
spirodela oligorrhiza has been reported (vijayaraghavan
et al., 1982). further, it has been suggested that nr
activity depends upon active photosynthesis or production of photosynthates and required photosynthetically
generated reductant (nadh) and energy (aslam et al.,
1973; vijayaraghavan et al., 1982; raghuram and sopory, 1995). hence, reduction in nr activity in chromium-treated n. alba plants could be probably due to
the inhibition of chlorophyll biosynthesis leading to
lower photosynthetic rates concomitantly supplying
lower levels of photosynthates. chromium induced lower
photosynthetic rates have been reported in spirodela
polyrrhiza (tripathi and smith, 1996) and nelumbo lutea
(franco et al., 1993). depleted protein content in chromium treated n. alba plants might be ascribed to the
lower nr activity. a positive correlation between nr
activity and protein content has been demonstrated in
earlier studies (rai et al., 1992).

besides, chromium induced oxidative stress in plants
(roy et al., 1992), inhibition of nr activity due to oxidative stress caused by copper has also been reported by
luna et al. (1997). experiments are currently under way
to determine if chromium inhibits ±sh containing nr
directly or aects it by generating oxidative stress. it is
concluded that n. alba is a promising accumulator of
chromium and maximum accumulation observed in
roots followed by leaves and rhizomes. the plant was
tolerant to 1 lm cr level. higher concentrations of
chromium aected various metabolic parameters.
chromium-induced reduction in chlorophyll biosynthesis involved reduced activity of  xxxg121xxx  which was impaired in substrate (ala) utilization. chromium also
aected nr activity and protein content of n. alba.
higher sensitivity of nr to chromium can be used as
biochemical indicator of cr pollution in water.
