[3h]win 35,065-2: a ligand for cocaine receptors in striatum.  [3h]win 35,065-2 binding to striatal membranes was characterized, primarily by centrifugation assay. like [3h]cocaine, [3h]win 35,065-2 binds to both high- and low-affinity sites. [3h]win 35,065-2, however, exhibits consistently higher affinities than [3h]cocaine. saturation experiments indicate a low-affinity binding site with an apparent kd of approximately 160 nm and a bmax of 135 fmol/mg of tissue. a high-affinity site has also been identified with an apparent kd of 5.6 nm and a bmax of 5.2 fmol/mg of tissue. the specific-to-nonspecific binding ratios with [3h]win 35,065-2 were higher than with [3h]cocaine in both centrifugation and filtration assays. pharmacological characterization suggests that [3h]win 35,065-2 binds to the  xxxg2149xxx .  xxxd2546xxx , gbr 12909,  xxxd2746xxx , and (-)-cocaine are potent inhibitors of [3h]win 35,065-2 binding. in contrast, the  xxxg2148xxx  ligand desipramine is a weak inhibitor, and the serotonin transporter ligand citalopram does not inhibit binding. the effect of sodium on binding was examined under conditions in which (a) the low-affinity site was primarily (87%) occupied and (b) approximately 50% of both sites were occupied. the results indicate that both sites are sodium dependent. injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the striatum results in a significant loss of both high- and low-affinity sites, a finding suggesting that both sites are on dopaminergic nerve terminals. taken together, these data are consistent with the presence of multiple cocaine binding sites associated with the  xxxg2149xxx .
