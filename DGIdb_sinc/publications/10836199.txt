abstract

introduction

t h e cellular action o f steroid liormones is mediated by
spec$ receptors. recently, two dgerent estrogen receptors
( e r ) , a and p, have been cloned with a spec$ tissue
distribution. active estrogen as well as activeprogestin are
compounds of oral hormonal contraceptives and hormone
replacement therapy .
t o examinate the regulation o f e r - a and -p activities
after treatment with synthetic progestins and synthetic
and natural estrogens, cos 7 cells were transfecfed with
the vector expressing e r - a and -p in combination with a
lucqerase reporter vector. er-a activity was tipregulated
in the presence of syntheticprogestins in a dose-riependent
manner. noretliisterone, norethynodre1 and  xxxd1849xxx 
proved to be the most potent stirnulatory agents of er-a
expression. on the other hand, flat all progestins
exhibited a stirnulatory action on er-p activity. o n l y
novgestrel, levonovgestrel, noretliynodrel and  xxxd2751xxx  induced er-p-activating functions in a dosedependent manner. ltrcferase activity due to estrogen
stimulation served as a positive control.
our results indicate that progestiiis have dgerent
ejects on the activities o f e r - a and -p.

the involvenient of progesterone in the growth
and development of breast cancer has increasingly
been recognized in recent years. there is still
conflicting evidence regarding the increased risk of
breast cancer in women who are being treated with
horinoiie replacement therapy (hrt) or in those
who take oral hormonal contraceptives’,’.
in vitro data about the proliferative effects of
progcstins on breast cancer cells are contradictory:
progestins are found to stimulate growth, have no
effect clr even inhibit cell pr~liferation”~.
clinical
studies have reported the benefit of progestins
such as niedroxyprogesterone acetate and  xxxd2557xxx  in the treatment ofbreast cancer”’. the
reasons fbr the inconsistency in the reported effects
of progestins are probably based on the functional
interaction between estrogen and progesterone
reccptors.  xxxg1737xxx  expression is
induced by active  xxxg730xxx , whereas
cstrogc-n action is antagonized by progestins’:’.
additionally, progestins show various binding
affinities to all steroid hormone receptors,

progertins and  xxxg730xxx -a and

-p activities

including the  xxxg730xxx '". therefore, it is
difficult to differentiate the specific effect of
progestins from that of estrogens.
two estrogen receptors have been cloned and
characterized with a specific tissue distribution".
most breast cancer cells mainly express estrogen
receptor ( e r ) - a either alone or in combination
with er-p. t he expression of er-p'* and its
i s o f ~ r m s seems
'~
to be a poor prognostic factor.
th e coexpression of both receptors is associated
with a higher node positivity and a higher
gradingl4. furthermore, the m r n a of several
ek-p subtypes has been isolated from human
breast tissue. t h e authors suggest that the ratios of
these m r n a s change during tumorigenesis and
tumor p r ~g r e s sion'~.
since isoforms of the er-p
receptor have been found in non-gynecological
tumors, such as colon cancer" and meningiomas",
a therapeutic application of steroid hormones with
estrogenic effects should be considered with care.
estrogens themselves are not mitogenic, but
promote the growth of already transformed breast
cancer cells in vivo and in vitro'h~". the putative
targets of the proliferative steroid action include
early genes, such asfos, jun-b and m y p , cell cyclecontrolling gene products, such as cyclin dl", and
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitorsz2.
t o delineate the functions of progestins in oral
contraceptives in the regulation of e r - a and -p
activities, c o s 7 cells were transfected with
constructs expressing e r - a and -p in combination
with a luciferasc reporter gene driven by an
estrogen response element containing a promoter.
a better understanding of the multiple endocrine
activities of synthetic progestins is required for
their use in the therapy of breast and endometrial
cancers, hormone replacement in postmenopausal
women and for the evaluation of the consequences
of long-term oral contraceptive use.

steroid hormones were a generous gft from
schering (berlin, germany): gestodene, norethynodrel,  xxxd1849xxx ,  xxxd2751xxx ,  xxxd2754xxx 
and levonorgestrel. 17p-estradiol, l7a-estradiol,
 xxxd2054xxx , estriol and estrone were purchased froni the sigma chemical co. (deisenhofen,
germany). stock solutions of 10 nm were prcpared by dissolving the above substances in 99.8%
ethanol (carl koth gmbh, karlsruhe, germany)
and were kept at -20°c in the dark.
for the cell transfection, human vectors expressing e r d 3 as well as er-pz4(psg5-hego and
pcmv5-hekb) were used. for the reporter gene
analysis, an estrogen response element coupled
luciferase gene-expressing pla~ niid*~
(2 x eretk-luc) was cotransfected.

transient transfection of cos 7 cells
cos 7 cells were routinely grown at a density of
1-5 x lo"/ml in dmem/f12 supplemented with
1% non-essential amino acids, 2 m m glutamax and
10% hormone-stripped fetal bovine serum. for
transfection with the estrogen response element
and  xxxg730xxx  genes, the superfecttm
transfection reagent kit from qiagen (hildcn,
germany) was used. briefly, cells were seeded at a
density of 2.5 x 1o5 per 60-nim dish and cultivated
at 37°c and 5% coz in dmem supplemented
with 1 0 % fetal bovine serum for 24 h. the following day, 5 p g of dna dissolved in a 10 m m
tris-hci and 1 nim edta solution were diluted
with dmem/f12 niediuni to a total volume of
150 p1. after the addition of 30 pl of superfect
transfection reagent to the d n a solution, samples
were incubated for 10 min at room temperature to
allow complex formation. in the meantime, cells
were washed once with 4 ml phosphate-buffered
saline. a i-rnl volume of dmem/f12 supplemented with serum and antibiotics was added
to the d n a transfection complex, mixed and the
total volume immediately transfered to the cells.
after a 2--3 h incubation at 37°c and 5% co ?, the
medium was changed and cells were allowed to
grow for another 24 h. untransfected cells served
as a control.

a negative control, cells were treated with vehicle
alone (ethanol at 0.1% v/v). finally, cells were
lysed with the lysis buffer of the luciferase
reporter gene assay kit (boehringer mannheim,
mannheim, germany), and cell extracts were
collected and frozen at -20°c until required.

luciferase reporter gene assay
t o assess the firefly luciferase expression in cells
transfected with er-cx or -p, the commercially
available luciferase reporter gene assay was used.
briefly, 50 p1 of cell extract was transferred into a
96-well microtiter plate and the cheniiluminescence reaction was initiated by injecting 100 p1
of luciferase assay reagent. luciferase activity
(expressed in relative light units) was assayed for
10 s with a luminometer (microlumat lb 96,
e.g. & g. berthold, aliquippa, pa, usa). each
sample, as well as reaction buffer, was assayed in
duplicate. the intra-assay coefficient of variation

a

was always < 10% and assays were repeated if this
criterion was not met.

effect of synthetic progestins on er-a
activity
in order to investigate the effect of synthetic
progestins on e k - a activity, cos 7 cells were
transfected with the human er-cx expression
vector psg5hego and the estrogen response
element cloned in a firefly luciferase reporter
construct ( 2 ere-tk-luc)
~
as an easily detectable marker.
figure la-d depicts the er-a levels expressed
as relative light units. as a positive control, cos
7-transfected cells were treated with a panel of
synthetic estrogens, as well as with  xxxd2054xxx ,
at the same concentrations as the progestins. all
estrogens tested led to an upregulation of er-cx
activity compared to untransfected cells or those
treated only with vehicle (figure la). both natural
estrogens, 1 7 a - and 17 p-estradiol, exhibited

similar effects (means: 179 x lo4 and 145 x 1o4 relative light units, respectively). relatively high luciferase activity was observed after estrone, as well as
after estriol, treatment (means: 1 2 2 lo4
~ and
117 x 1o4 relative light units, respectively). among
the progestin group,  xxxd1849xxx  (figure id),  xxxd2751xxx  and norethynodrel (figure lc) proved
to be the most potent stimulatory agents of er-cx.
in particular, at the highest concentration of 1 nm,
means of 9 8 lo3,
~ 7 3 lo3
~ and 71 x lo3 relative
light units were measured in the lysates, respectively. the effect of the other progestins was less
pronounced (figure 1b).
the activity of er-cx after incubation with
 xxxd2054xxx  at 1 n m (mean: 1 9 4 lo4
~ relative
light units) proved to be the most efficient and was
defined as 100%. in figure 2a-c, the relative
enhancement of er-cx activity is depicted. the
administration of either  xxxd1849xxx ,  xxxd2751xxx  or norethynodrel at 1 n m resulted in
activities of 50.6 f 6, 37.7 f 4 and 36.8 f 4 (mean
96 f sd), respectively (figure 2a). o n the other
hand, the incubation of transduced cells with the
other three progestins (gestodene, levonorgestrel
and  xxxd2754xxx ) at 1 n m stimulated the activity of
er-cx to only 4.9 k 3, 27.1 f 7 and 29 f 4 (mean
% f sd), respectively. a dose dependency was
observed after the incubation of cells with steroids
at 0.1 (figure 2b) or 0.01 nm (figure 2c).

effect of synthetic progestins on er-p
activity
the activity ofer-p after progestin treatment was
investigated in transiently transfected cos 7 cclls
by means of the luciferase reporter gene assay. not
all of the progestins acted in a stiniulatory manncr
(figure 3b and c). enhanced activity was observed
only after incubation with either  xxxd2754xxx ,
levonorgestrel, norethynodrel or  xxxd2751xxx 
(figure 3b and c). this was particularly noted after
incubation with the highest hormone doses, when
means of 3 5 x lo3, 1 5 lo3,
~ 2 3 x lo3 and 1 7 lo3

incubation with 17p-estradio1, 17a-estradiol

discussion
w e investigated the effects of the synthetic
progestins present in oral contraceptives, such as
 xxxd2751xxx , norethynodrel,  xxxd2754xxx , levonorgestrel,  xxxd2067xxx  and gestodene, on
er-a and -p activities. it can be concluded that all
progestins except gestodene exhibited estrogenagoriistic action on the reporter vector.
i n our irz vitvo system, only e r activity was
analyzhle, since no other steroid receptors are
expressed in cos 7 cells. thus, physiological
reactions with other receptors, such as receptor

investigated. for example, it is well known that
third-generation progestins, such as gestodcne,
have a marked affinity for the  xxxg183xxx ”,
whereas w e demonstrated only a negligible estrogenic effict.
conflicting results have been obtained on the
role of progestins in human breast cancer in vivo
and in vitvo. t h e treatment of advanced breast cancer patic-nts with  xxxd2557xxx  and  xxxd2554xxx  resulted in a response rate of
30-400/i?8-3”. in the human breast cancer cell line
zk-75-1, the synthetic progestin r5020 exerts a
 xxxg1737xxx -specific inhibition of cell
proliferation in the presence of estrogen”’. progestins also inhibited the growth of progesterone
receptor-negative mda-mb-231 cells, although
this effect was independent of the  xxxg730xxx  and estrogens5. again, interaction with other
receptors is likely.
in contrast to the antiproliferative action of
progestins, growth-promoting effects were also
found. during the past decade, studies have linked
an incrcased incidence of breast cancer to the use
of synthetic progestins in oral contraceptives”.
in vivo studies with carcinogen-induced mammary
tumors in rats have shown a growth-promoting
effect of low doses of progesterone, probably in
synergism with
t h e t47d breast
cancer cell line showed increased proliferation after
progestin adniini~tration’~.it is assumed that the
proliferative effect of progestin is mediated via
an  xxxg730xxx -mediated mechanism. this
theory is supported by the observation that most
clinical trials have failed to find a significant
correlation between the objective response to
progestin therapy and  xxxg1737xxx  status
and/or content””.’.
according to our data, the most significant
upregulation of er-cx activity was found after cell
incubation with  xxxd1849xxx , norethynodrel and
 xxxd2751xxx . in contrast, ek-p was markedly
activated only by  xxxd2754xxx , and to lesser extent by
 xxxd2751xxx , norethynodrel and levonorgestrel.

indicating that this effect is mediated via the  xxxg730xxx '. a similar study revealed that
 xxxd2751xxx ,  xxxd2754xxx , levonorgestrel and
gestodene increased the growth of er-positive
(mcf-7 and t-47-d), but not er-negative
(mda-mb-231), breast cancer cells in culture.
furthermore, all progestins that increased cell proliferation also activated a cat (chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase) reporter gene containing an
 xxxg730xxx  response element derived from
the vitellogenin 2a gene. in these experiments,
antiestrogens, but not antiprogestins, inhibited
progestin-stimulated cell proliferation, again
indicating an  xxxg730xxx -mediated mechanism32.all these results are in direct contrast to the
fact that the 19-nortestosterone derivatives gestodene and  xxxd1849xxx  do not have any significant
affinity for the estrogen r e ~ e p t o p ~it~ is
' . therefore
supposed that the estrogenic action of  xxxd2751xxx ,  xxxd2754xxx  and levonorgestrel is a consequence

of their metabolism into the 3(a,p) 5a-reduced
derivatives by 5a-reductase activity in breast
cancer cells". it has been demonstrated that
the 5a-reduction of these progestins correlates
with an increase in  xxxg730xxx  binding
affinity4'.
o u r in vitvo data show that the estrogenic action
of synthetic progestins can be mediated via the
estrogen receptors. however, cell incubation
with hormones does not only have an impact on
receptor activity: other effects, such as impacts
on ccll p r ~ l i f e r a t i o n ~
and

capacity44,
were not investigated in our experiments. such
effects may play an important role in the course of
malignancies.
the different expression patterns of e r - a and
-p, and the limited knowledge about their involvement in specific pathologcal conditions, should be
taken into consideration when progestins arc used
for various clinical purposes.
