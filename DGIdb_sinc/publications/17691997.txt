abstract: cyclo-oxygenase (cox)-2 selective inhibitors (coxibs) were designed to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal (gi) adverse
events (aes) which occur with non-selective nsaids (ns-nsaids).  xxxd2069xxx  and  xxxd2517xxx  are regarded as second generation
coxibs because of their higher cox-2 selectivity. there are three published pooled analyses relating to the gi tolerability of  xxxd2069xxx 
(60-120mg/day) and  xxxd2517xxx  (200-400mg/day) which used individual patient’s data from studies sponsored by the manufacturers.
we also reviewed new clinical trials published after the pooled analyses, to determine the global gi safety profiles of  xxxd2069xxx  and  xxxd2517xxx . we included discontinuations due to gi events, endoscopic ulcers, symptomatic ulcers, and ulcer complications. current evidence suggests that  xxxd2069xxx  and  xxxd2517xxx  have significantly more favorable gi profiles than ns-nsaids, and are similar to first
generation coxibs with respect to gi safety. the most clinically important benefit of the coxibs is seen in the reduced rate of symptomatic
ulcer and ulcer complications, which are still common in chronic nsaids users especially in high risk patients. in the largest gi outcome
study of any coxib, target, involving more than 18000 patients,  xxxd2517xxx  was associated with a 79% reduction in ulcer complications in patients not taking aspirin. the differences between  xxxd2069xxx  or  xxxd2517xxx  and ns-nsaids in relation to ulcer complications
are apparent early during treatment and remain constant over time during the course of treatment; therefore, benefit of  xxxd2069xxx  and  xxxd2517xxx  can be seen in patients with high gi ulcer complication risk who require nsaids from the beginning of use to throughout the
prescription duration.

key words: coxib,  xxxd2069xxx ,  xxxd2517xxx , ulcer, ulcer complications.
introduction
cyclo-oxygenase (cox)-2 selective inhibitors (coxibs) are
known to have a safer gi safety profile than non-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ns-nsaids) when providing
similar anti-inflammatory efficacy, as has been shown in studies of
the first generation coxibs, celecoxib and rofecoxib [1,2].
 xxxd2069xxx ,  xxxd3481xxx ,  xxxd2849xxx  and  xxxd2517xxx  are regarded
as second generation coxibs because of their higher selectivity for
cox-2 inhibition than celecoxib and rofecoxib [3, 4]. coxibs were
developed with the anticipation of significantly reducing the serious
gi complications associated with chronic ns-nsaids use in high
risk patients. the development of newer coxibs and their use extend
our knowledge in understanding the role of cox-1 and cox-2 and
anti-inflammatory efficacy in clinical practice. these new generation coxibs have also shown fewer gi adverse events in clinical
trials compared with traditional nsaids [3 5,6], while having antiinflammatory efficacy at least as good as ns-nsaids and superior
to placebo in the treatment of several conditions [7-9]. in head-tohead direct comparison trials, second generation coxibs are considered to have similar clinical efficacy [10-13] and a similar gi profile to that of first generation coxibs [14-16], and better tolerated
with less dyspepsia [16].
 xxxd3481xxx  was withdrawn from the market in april 2005 because of the potential increased risk for serious cardiovascular (cv)
and skin adverse events [17].  xxxd2849xxx  is the injectable pro-drug of
 xxxd3481xxx , and we have restricted our systematic review and discussion to the gi safety profile of the two new oral coxibs,  xxxd2069xxx  and  xxxd2517xxx .
methods
we conducted a systematic review of all published randomized
controlled trials (rcts) of  xxxd2069xxx  and  xxxd2517xxx  up to january 2006 in medline, pubmed and cochrane central register of
controlled trials. only those papers published in the english language, reporting raw data related to gi safety, including gi adverse
events (aes), withdrawals, endoscopic ulcers, symptomatic ulcers,

and clinically significant gi complications, were reviewed and
summarized. studies of single dose coxib, phamacodynamic studies, duplicate publications and studies without raw data of gi safety
were excluded.
clinical trials were assessed for quality using the jadad 5 point
scale [18] and only studies with two or more scores were included.
meta-analyses and systematic reviews were also searched in medline and the cochrane database of systematic reviews to identify
any summarized data of gastrointestinal aes for  xxxd2069xxx  and
 xxxd2517xxx  under specific criteria such as for a subset patient
group or unpublished papers. details of rcts reported after the
publication of the related meta-analysis were also reviewed.
results
 xxxd2069xxx 
literature search identified 29 clinical trials, 3 meta-analyses
[2, 5, 19] for  xxxd2069xxx  from 2001 to 2005.
gastrointestinal adverse event data for  xxxd2069xxx  from 7 studies
were reviewed and summarized from 29 available clinical trials; 22
studies were excluded including 7 studies of a single dose of  xxxd2069xxx , 5 pharmacokinetic studies, 1 study did not report any gi aes
for 196 patients taking  xxxd2069xxx  (90-120mg daily) for 6 weeks
[20]. nine studies had been analyzed in meta-analyses.
all 3 meta-analyses for  xxxd2069xxx  combined merck &co sponsored clinical trials, including data published in abstracts and full
papers. the objectives of each meta-analysis varied and they did
not include the same studies. in watson’s combined analysis, individual patient data from 4138 patients were examined from 9 clinical trials of  xxxd2069xxx  up to 2004 in patients with osteoarthritis
arthritis (oa), rheumatoid arthritis (ra), chronic low back pain
(lbp), or  xxxg1055xxx  (as),and the analysis aimed to
look at discontinuations due to gi adverse events [2]. ramey et al.
conducted a combined analysis of 5441 patients from 10 rcts of
 xxxd2069xxx  in treating oa, ra, as. studies completed by june 2003
were included and aimed to investigate the incidence of upper gi
adverse events including gi perforations, symptomatic ulcers and
upper gi bleedings (pubs) [5]. two low back pain trials [21,22],
one abstract for an oa and one abstract for an ra trial, which were
included in watson’s analysis, were not included in ramey’s study.
however, ramey’s analysis included two endoscopic trials, one full
paper [23] and one abstract for an oa trial which were not included

in watson’s study [2]. hunt et al. conducted the earliest combined
analysis of upper gi events in all 10 phase ii/iii clinical trials of
 xxxd2069xxx  versus ns-nsaids (naproxen, ibuprofen, or diclofenac)
in trials of oa, ra and lbp [19]. some studies were on-going at
the cut-off date of may 2001 with 3142  xxxd2069xxx  users and 1828
ns-nsaids users included. as trials were not included and data on
 xxxd2069xxx  at less than 60mg/daily were not summarized [19].
therefore, we mainly reviewed results from watson’s and ramey’s
meta-analyses [2,5] for  xxxd2069xxx  together with the published studies they did not cover and also the rcts which became available
after the publication of the meta-analyses.
discontinuations due to gi adverse events
(aes)
reasons for discontinuation of treatment varied and included
lack of efficacy, aes, loss to follow-up, voluntary drop out or some
other reason(s) unrelated to the trial. in general,  xxxd2069xxx  is well
tolerated; out of 5441 patients, 64% of patients treated with  xxxd2069xxx  and 62% treated with ns-nsaids completed studies; the
incidence of discontinuation due to a clinical adverse event was
significantly lower for  xxxd2069xxx  than ns-nsaids (9.7 and 13.3 per
100 patient-year, respectively, rr 0.73, 95% ci 0.63-0.85) [5].
the meta-analysis of watson addresses discontinuation due to
gi aes for  xxxd2069xxx , by pre-specified gi aes which included
“dyspeptic symptoms, acid reflux, dyspepsia, epigastric discomfort,
heartburn, nausea, or vomiting, and abdominal pain” [2]. four of
the 9 studies were in abstract form.  xxxd2069xxx  (60mg, 90mg, or
120mg) was compared with ns-nsaids (dicolfenac 50mg tid, or
naproxen 500mg bid); 27.6%, 6.9% and 4.6% of the total study
population had a history of upper gi symptoms with nsaids, history of upper gi ulcer or bleeding, or were consuming concomitant
low-dose aspirin, respectively. four thousand seven hundred eighty
two patients were involved; duration of studies ranged from 6 to 44
weeks with participation extended up to 190 weeks; new use of
gastroprotective agents (gpa) and discontinuation due to dyspeptic
symptoms were analyzed. the overall rate/100 patient-years for
new use of gpas was 9.1 (10.3 for the first 6 months) for  xxxd2069xxx  and 13.0 (21.9 for the first 6 months) for ns-nsaids (rr
0.75, 95% ci 0.64-0.89, p<0.001). a significant difference was
seen in the first 6 months (rr 0.49, 95% ci 0.38- 0.63) but not
subsequently (rr 1.06, 95% ci 0.84-1.33). the overall rate/100
patient-years of treatment discontinuation due to dyspeptic symptoms and/or any gi/abdominal aes were significantly lower for
 xxxd2069xxx  than ns-nsaids (1.5 vs. 2.7, rr 0.60, 95% ci 0.41, 0.87,
and 3.6 vs.7.0, rr 0.57, 95%ci 0.45, 0.72, respectively) (fig. 1)
[2].
two endoscopic studies conducted in oa or ra patients were
not included in watson’s analysis [19, 24]. the proportions of patients who discontinued due to digestive system aes or abdominal
pain were 9.0%, 4.0% and 0.4% for naproxen (1000mg/day),  xxxd2069xxx  (120mg/day), and placebo groups respectively (p 0.011 for
 xxxd2069xxx  or naproxen vs. placebo) in one study [24]. in the second
study, gi related aes were 36.5% in the ibuprofen (2400mg/day)
group, 24% in the  xxxd2069xxx  (120mg/day) and 17.6% in the placebo
group respectively and a significant difference was seen between
the ibuprofen and placebo groups only. however, the rates for discontinuation due to any aes were similar across all groups (6.6%
for ibuprofen, 7.7% for  xxxd2069xxx  and 4.7% for placebo) without
specified gi events [19].
zacher’s study compared the therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of  xxxd2069xxx  (60mg once daily) with diclofenac (50mg tid) in
patients with oa, and was not included in watson’s combined
analysis [2]. this study did not provide raw data for discontinuation
due to gi-related aes. nonetheless, discontinuation due to drugrelated aes and the incidence of gi aes were not significantly
different between the  xxxd2069xxx  and diclofenac groups (3.5% vs.
3.1% and 12.9% vs. 14.2%, respectively) [23].

fig. (1). cumulative incidence of discontinuation due to dyspeptic symptoms in the treatment group. test of the proportional hazards assumption for
the cox model was not significant ( p = 0.70). the rates/100 patient years
were 1.5 in the  xxxd2069xxx  and 2.7 in ns-nsaid groups, respectively, rr
0.60, 95% ci 0.41–0.87; p = 0.007). from watson dj, et al. curr med res
opin. 2004; 20(12): 1899-908 [2] (reprint permission obtained from curr
med res opin, librapharm limited).

seven new published rcts were retrieved [25-30,13]. four
provided discontinuation data due to gi aes.  xxxd2069xxx  treatment
resulted in similar or less discontinuations due to gi related aes
compared with ns-nsaids, in short term (1 week) or long term
therapy (12-52 weeks) (table 1).
in the most recent published multicentre rct by curtis and
colleagues, 550 oa patients randomly received  xxxd2069xxx  30mg,
60mg, and 90mg or diclofenac 150mg for 52-weeks. a higher percentage of patients in the diclofenac group had gi “nuisance”
symptoms including abdominal pain, acid reflux, dyspepsia, epigastric discomfort, heartburn nausea and vomiting, than in the  xxxd2069xxx  groups, which was consistent with the higher discontinuation
rate due to gi events [25].  xxxd2069xxx  30mg once daily in oa subjects for 12 weeks also caused a significantly lower incidence of
discontinuation due to gi events or abdominal pain than that in
ibuprofen users and was similar to the placebo group and no gi
complications were reported in any group [26]. in patients with as
treated with  xxxd2069xxx  (90-120mg/day) and naproxen (500mg twice
daily) for 46 weeks, dyspepsia was more frequent in the  xxxd2069xxx 
group than in the naproxen group. however, there was no significant difference in discontinuations for any aes or among patients
with digestive system or abdominal pain aes [27] (table 1).
gi related aes were also significantly higher in patients with
gouty arthritis (ga) who took indomethacin for 8 days compared
with those taking  xxxd2069xxx  120mg daily, although the duration of
treatment was short and there were no serious aes and no discontinuations related to the gi tract [28]. similar gi related aes were
seen in a study of similar design but discontinuations rates due to
gi aes were not clearly stated although the overall discontin-uation
rates were not significantly different between treatments [29].
in the only study comparing  xxxd2069xxx  and rofecoxib in patients with hemophilic arthropathy (ha) for 6 months [13], 9 patients in the  xxxd2069xxx  group but none in rofecoxib discontinued
due to clinical aes; however, no raw data was for discontinuations
due to gi events (table 1).
faecal red blood loss (fbl)
measurement of faecal 51cr labeled red blood loss provides a
surrogate indirect measure of injury over the entire length of the gi
tract, including areas beyond the reach of upper gi endoscopy.
whole gut microbleeding can be assessed precisely, continuously
and quantitatively by the measurement of 51cr-labeled red blood

cells in stool [31]. hunt et al. modified the technique including
measurement of total daily stool collection, and found that in
healthy volunteers, fbl increased consistently with ibuprofen
800mg three times daily after 4 weeks (n=17, geometric mean ratio
of weeks 20 /baseline=7.97), whereas faecal blood loss in  xxxd2069xxx  (120mg) users (n=21, mean=2.59) did not differ from placebo
(n=21, mean=2.44) which slightly increased than the baseline [24].
further post hoc study of two trials found that treatment with a
therapeutic dose of ibuprofen (2400mg/day) in healthy subjects is
associated with significant fbl, which occurs randomly with
spikes of bleeding, sometimes exceeding 65 ml in a single day
[32]. this magnitude of faecal blood loss should not be considered
as “micro”, and is consistent with the significantly higher rate of gi
complications reported with ns-nsaids than coxibs in clinical
trials [19, 33,34].
ulcers detected by endoscopy
the two endoscopic trials [19, 24] were both multicentre, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind and placebo controlled. they
compared  xxxd2069xxx  120mg once daily with placebo and naproxen
in ra and oa patients [24] or with ibuprofen in oa patients [19].
in the first trial, the incidence of gastric and /or duodenal ulcers was
significantly higher in the naproxen (1000mg/day) group (n=244)
than in the  xxxd2069xxx  group (n=251) at week 12 (24.5% vs. 17.9%
for ulcers 3mm and 18.9% vs.12.7% for ulcers 5mm, both
p<0.0001); the cumulative incidence of ulcers in the  xxxd2069xxx 
group was significantly higher than that in the placebo group
(7.42% vs. 1.35% for ulcers 3mm at week 12, p=0.002). the number of gastroduodenal erosions at week 12 was significantly higher
in the naproxen group than in the  xxxd2069xxx  group which did not
differ from the placebo group [24]. in the second endoscopic study
of similar design, the cumulative incidence of ulcers  3mm at
week 12 in the ibuprofen (2400mg /day) group (n=226) was significantly higher than in the  xxxd2069xxx  group (n=221) (17.0% vs. 8.1%

for ulcers 3mm and 12.3% vs.6.2% for ulcers 5mm, p<0.0001
and p=0.035, respectively). the incidence of ulcers in the  xxxd2069xxx  group was significantly higher than in the placebo group
(1.86% for ulcers 3mm and 0.45% for ulcers 5mm, p=0.003 and
p=0.001, respectively). the number of gastroduodenal erosions at
week 12 was also significantly higher in the ibuprofen group than in
the  xxxd2069xxx  group (p<0.001) but no significant difference was
found between  xxxd2069xxx  and placebo groups [19].
symptomatic ulcer and ulcer complications
in ramey’s meta-analysis of 5441 patients from 10 studies, 113
eligible potential upper gi pubs were reported by investigators and
2 were determined as non-upper gi events (one small bowel perforation and one hemorrhoids) [5]. ninety-five of the 113 patients (47
for  xxxd2069xxx  and 64 for nsaids) had confirmed events by the
adjudication committee (40 for  xxxd2069xxx  and 55 for nsaids). of
the 50 investigator-reported complicated pubs, 42 had confirmed
clinically complicated events (19 for  xxxd2069xxx  and 23 for
nsaids).the confirmed pubs rate was significantly lower for
 xxxd2069xxx  than nsaids (1.00 vs. 2.47 per 100 patient-years, rr,
0.48, 95% ci 0.32-0.73). as shown by meier survival curves (fig.
2). the cumulative incidence curve for the two treatment groups
separated early and the difference between them was maintained
throughout the follow up period, indicating a consistently lower risk
of pubs in the  xxxd2069xxx  group over time. similar results were
seen with all investigator-reported pubs (rr 0.49, 95% ci 0.330.72) and a non-significant lower incidence was seen in the  xxxd2069xxx  group for confirmed complicated pubs (rr, 0.59, 95% ci
0.32-1.09, p=0.09) and for investigator-reported complicated pubs
(rr 0.55, 95% ci 0.31-0.98, p=0.41), which may due to the small
number of overall events [5]. in all subgroup analyses, the advantage of  xxxd2069xxx  was consistently seen, with a significantly lower
incidence in the subgroups of young or old (<65 or >65 years), in
those without a history of pub, corticosteroid users or those not

taking steroids, patients not taking or taking gastroprotective agents
(gpas), female and male gender, and subgroups of both ra and
oa subjects. three point eight percent (3.8%) of  xxxd2069xxx  users
and 4.5% of nsaids users were also concomitant aspirin users,
and pubs events were seen in 6 on  xxxd2069xxx  and 2 on nsaids,
but the sample size is too small to conduct a meaningful analysis in
aspirin users [5].

no data on pubs was reported in the two lbp trials of  xxxd2069xxx , which included 215 [21] and 210 [22]  xxxd2069xxx  treated
patients, respectively, and they were not included in ramey’s combined analysis [5].
only one new published rct compared  xxxd2069xxx  with nsnsaids [25] (table 2). in the curtis efficacy study, one patient out
of 448 patients with oa who took  xxxd2069xxx  90mg daily over 52
weeks had a gastric ulcer and this patient had a prior history of
esophagitis and gastric erosions. no other ulcer or ulcer complication was reported in other  xxxd2069xxx  or diclofenac users [25]. in the
only study which compared  xxxd2069xxx  and rofecoxib in patients
with ha [13], 6.8%  xxxd2069xxx  takers and 5.3 % on rofecoxib had
serious aes, including gi complications and other events seen with
ha including a subdural hematoma, etc. however, no raw data was
given for gi complications and was not forthcoming when the
authors were contacted (table 2).

other gi safety issues: drug-drug interaction
the dose proportionality of  xxxd2069xxx  has been studied over the
dose range from 5 to 150mg, in single and multiple doses, in
healthy volunteers and was well tolerated [35-37]. the impact of
hepatic cytochrome p450 on pharmacokinetics are not the same for
all coxibs [38].  xxxd2069xxx  is metabolized extensively and cleared
by oxidative metabolism and cyp2c19 plays a relatively small role
in the overall clearance ( 20%) of  xxxd2069xxx . thus, drug interactions with  xxxd2069xxx  and p450 inhibitors are minor [39]. studies
suggest that p450 3a ( xxxg590xxx ) plays an important role (catalyzed
~60%) in the metabolism of  xxxd2069xxx  and more than other p450
enzymes like cyp2c9 (10% only) [40], and no effect was found
for  xxxd2069xxx  on hepatic  xxxg590xxx  activity in drug-drug interactions.
 xxxd2069xxx  has no significant drug interaction with ketoconazole, a
strong inhibitor of cyp3a4, but a greater reduction in  xxxd2069xxx 
auc was seen when it was given concomitantly with rifampin
which may be clinically significant [41].  xxxd2069xxx  at a dose of
60mg is generally well tolerated by patients with mild and moderate
hepatic and renal impairment [42,43].
 xxxd2517xxx 
twenty four clinical trials have been undertaken with  xxxd2517xxx  and 2 systematic reviews conducted until january 2006 [8,
16]. excluded studies included 3 duplicate trial publications, 3 single dose trials and 6 pharmacokinetic trials. twelve rcts met our
inclusion criteria (table 3); they all reported data related to gi aes.
berenbaum’s systematic review summarized data from nine clinical
efficacy studies of  xxxd2517xxx  in oa patients but did not specify
gi safety data [8]. the pooled analysis by hawkey and colleagues
reviewed results from 15 phase ii and iii rcts of  xxxd2517xxx  in
oa (n=6729) and ra (n=3538), and aimed to address the gi tolerability of  xxxd2517xxx  [16]. the incidence of pre-specified gi aes,
the discontinuation rate due to gi aes, the incidence of definite or
probable symptomatic upper gi ulcers and ulcer complications,
were measured outcomes. treatment arms of  xxxd2517xxx  less than
200mg per day or higher than 400mg per day were excluded in the
pooled analysis since high doses are not indicated for clinical use,
and low doses are administrated to a relatively small population in
which the risk is also lower than with the higher dose [16]. the 15
studies included by hawkey were 2 abstracts, 2 unpublished data on
file at novartis, 4 unpublished studies in which the efficacy data
were discussed in berenbaum’s review but without published raw
data of gi events. two endoscopic studies conducted in healthy
volunteers [44,45], the 52 weeks’ target outcomes study [34],
and 2 efficacy studies in oa [10, 11] were not included in the published pooled analysis, but included in our summarized table (table 3). no faecal red blood cell loss study has been published with

discontinuations due to gi adverse events
the most common gi aes, dyspepsia and upper abdominal
pain were decreased by about 50% in patients taking  xxxd2517xxx 
versus ns-nsaids (8.7% vs.16.8%, 95% ci 0.39-0.57, and 4.7%
vs. 11.6%, 95% ci 0.29-0.45, respectively), the dyspepsia was also
significantly less in  xxxd2517xxx  users when compared with other
coxibs (8.7% vs. 10.4%, 95 % ci 0.69-0.97) [16].
in the pooled analysis of oa or ra patients, discontinuations
as a result of all aes was 7.4% in patients taking  xxxd2517xxx  (200400mg) , which was significantly lower than in patients taking nsnsaids (dicolfenac 75mg twice daily, naproxen 500mg twice
daily, or ibuprofen 800mg three times daily) (11.8%, 95%c 0.480.74) and similar to other coxibs (rofecoxib 25mg once daily or
celecoxib 200mg once or twice daily, 7.5%) and placebo (5.4%)
[16]. discontinuations due to gi events, with both  xxxd2517xxx 
(3.3%) and other coxibs (3.4%) were lower than with ns-nsaids
(8.4%, 95% ci 0.29-0.49 and 0.28-0.53, respectively) [16].
in the 13 weeks study in patients with oa reported by lehmann
and colleagues, discontinuations due to any aes (including serious
aes) were fewer in patients who received  xxxd2517xxx  100mg od
(2.4%) or  xxxd2517xxx  100mg od with loading dose (200mg od for
the first 2 weeks) (3.3%) than in those receiving celecoxib (5.5%)
or placebo (4.0%) [10]. no raw data reported the discontinuation
rate due to gi aes, but the majority of discontinuations were due to
gi aes or musculoskeletal aes. the most common gi aes were
upper abdominal pain and dyspepsia, which were similar in the 4

treatment groups being 3.3% and 3.8% for  xxxd2517xxx  100mg od,
3.6% and 3.3% for  xxxd2517xxx  100mg with loading dose, 2.6% and
4.0% for celecoxib, 1.4% and 2.6% for placebo group, respectively
[10].
results from a similarly designed 13 week efficacy study reported by sheldon and colleagues, the overall incidence of any aes
were similar between the 4 study groups [11]. the discontinuation
rates due to any aes (including serious aes) were similar in patients receiving  xxxd2517xxx  100mg od (5.4%) or  xxxd2517xxx 
100mg od with a loading dose (200mg od) for the first 2 weeks
(3.9%) to those who received celecoxib (4.1%) or placebo (6.3%),
respectively. no raw data was reported for the incidence of dyspepsia or gi aes which led to discontinuation. however, diarrhea was
reported as the most common gi ae in 5.1%, 3.9%, 3.8%, and
3.4% of the 4 study groups, respectively [11].
endoscopic studies
consistent with a high cox-2 selectivity,  xxxd2517xxx  is associated with a reduced incidence of endoscopic mucosal erosions or
ulcers compared with ns-nsaids in both healthy volunteer studies
[44,45] for short-term use (8 days), and in treatment trials in patients with oa [15] or ra [14] for 13 weeks.
in the endoscopy study reported by atherton et al, high dose
 xxxd2517xxx  800mg daily was compared with naproxen 500mg bid
and placebo for 8 days in a crossover study in 25 healthy volunteers
[44]. at endoscopy, no erosions were found in the  xxxd2517xxx 

2242 current pharmaceutical design, 2007, vol. 13, no. 22

group versus 75% in the naproxen group and 12.5% in the placebo
group. biopsy-induced gastric microbleeding assessed by the water
aspiration technique previously reported by the same authors, was
significantly less in the  xxxd2517xxx  (86.7 hl) than in the naproxen
(121.8 hl) group and similar to placebo (109.1 hl). in this study,
both small and large bowel permeability were not increased in the
 xxxd2517xxx  and placebo groups, in contrast to the naproxen treated
group [44]. similarly, in another endoscopy study conducted in
healthy volunteers, subjects were randomly assigned to  xxxd2517xxx 
200mg bid compared with naproxen 500mg bid and placebo for 8
days; no subject taking  xxxd2517xxx  developed erosions whereas 13
had duodenal erosions in the naproxen group (65%, n=20 per
group); and an asymptomatic gastric ulcer developed in one patient
in the naproxen group [45].
in hawkey’s pooled analysis of 1708 ra or oa patients who
underwent scheduled endoscopy, ulcers were significantly fewer in
those taking  xxxd2517xxx  200mg once daily (4.3%) and  xxxd2517xxx 
400mg once daily (3.4%) compared with those taking ibuprofen
800mg tid for 3 months (14.8%, 95% ci 0.10-0.48 and 0.12-0.41,
respectively), and were similar to findings in those treated with
celecoxib 200mg once daily (3.2%) and celecoxib 200mg bid
(1.9%) [16]. this conclusion was not influenced by other risk factors. although h.pylori infection was associated with more ulcers
than in the overall group, endoscopic ulcers were significantly less
in the  xxxd2517xxx  groups (5.6% and 3.6%) than in the naproxen
group (17.6%), in h.pylori positive patients. these results are consistent in subgroup analyses of patients who had used ns-nsaids
previously. a high dose  xxxd2517xxx  arm (800mg once daily) in
patients with ra was not included in the pooled analysis [14], but
endoscopic ulcers  3mm in patients in this arm were significantly
less than with ibuprofen 800mg tid (4.3% vs. 13.6%, or 0.28, 95%
ci 0.11-0.69).
gi outcomes study
since the clinical significance of the endoscopic studies might
be questioned, the gi outcomes study known as the therapeutic
arthritis research and gastrointestinal event trial (target), was
performed to compare the risk of upper gi complications with nsnsaids. target is currently the largest multi-centre randomized
controlled trial of a coxib and enrolled 18, 325 patients with oa
age  50 [34, 46].  xxxd2517xxx  400mg daily, which was twice the
highest recommended approved dose for chronic use, was compared with ibuprofen 800mg tid, or naproxen 500mg bid for 52
weeks in two similarly sized sub-studies. patients were stratified
with respect to age and low-dose aspirin use (65-100mg daily).
patients with a history of chronic gastroprotective medication use,
an active ulcer within the previous 30days, or bleeding within the
previous year or a prior history of gastric or duodenal perforation or
obstruction were excluded. the primary endpoint was the difference in the time-to-event distribution of definite or probable upper
gi ulcer complications in patients not taking low-dose aspirin. secondary gi endpoints were the difference of definite or probable
upper gi ulcer complications in all patients including those taking
or not taking low-dose aspirin, and the difference in other gi events
including symptomatic and complicated upper gi ulcers, major
episode of gi bleeding and evidence of anaemia [46]. cv, renal and
hepatic safety together with general safety and efficacy endpoints
were also assessed.
twenty-four percent of the participants in target were lowdose aspirin users. when all patients were considered, upper gi
ulcer complications were reduced by a third in patients treated with
 xxxd2517xxx  compared with ibuprofen or naproxen (0.32 % vs
0.91%, hazard ratio, hr, 0.34, 95% ci 0.22-0.52, p<0.0001). a
significant difference was seen in the non-aspirin users (0.2% vs
0.92%, hr 0.21, 95% ci 0.12-0.37, p<0.0001), but this benefit was
not seen in low-dose aspirin users (0.69% vs 0.88%, hr 0.79, 95%
ci 0.4-1.55, p=0.4876) [34]. (fig. 3). a significant reduction in
ulcer complications was seen in patients with and without h.pylori

yuan and hunt

infection. symptomatic uncomplicated ulcers were also significantly less in  xxxd2517xxx  treated patients than in the ns-nsaids
group (0.64% vs 1.13%, hr 0.55, 95 % ci 0.4-0.76). the incidence
of combined complicated or symptomatic ulcers was significantly
lower in overall patients (hr 0.46, 95% ci 0.36-0.60) and those not
taking low-dose aspirin (hr 0.38, 95% ci 0.28-0.52), and nonsignificantly lower in those taking low-dose aspirin (hr 0.73, 95%
ci 0.47-1.14) [34]. the incidence of cv events did not differ between  xxxd2517xxx  and ns-nsaids [47] and combined adjudicated
gi and cv endpoints were reduced by 35% in patients on  xxxd2517xxx  versus ns-nsaids; discontinuation due to serious aes and
death or due to pre-specified gi aes were not different between
 xxxd2517xxx  and ns-nsaids [34].

symptomatic ulcer and ulcer complications
in the meta-analysis presented by hawkey, 2.5% of ns-nsaids
users, 0.4%  xxxd2517xxx  users, 0.4% taking other coxibs and 0% on
placebo developed symptomatic ulcers with a significant difference
reported between ns-nsaids and  xxxd2517xxx  (2.1%, 95 ci 0.080.26, p<0.001) (fig. 4) [16].
when symptomatic ulcer and ulcer complications were combined, the event rate was 13.7 per 100 patient-years (95% ci 9.518.8) with ns-nsaids. this was reduced 8-fold to 1.7 (95 % ci
1.1-2.4) per 100 patient-years in patients treated with  xxxd2517xxx .
in those on another coxib the rate was 1.4 (95% ci 0.7-2.6) per 100
patient-years, and to 0 in those on placebo. rr was 0.12 (95% ci
0.07-0.20) for  xxxd2517xxx  compared with ns-nsaids [16]. symptomatic ulcer and ulcer complication events separated early in the
time-to-event analysis (fig. 5).
no symptomatic ulcer or ulcer complication was reported in the
other efficacy studies [10,11,49-51].
other gi safety issue: drug-drug interaction
since  xxxd2517xxx  is extensively metabolised by cyp2c9 [52],
adverse events may occur in patients with hepatic dysfunction, or
are on concomitant drugs metabolized by the same enzyme system.
however, studies have shown that the pharmacokinetics of lumira-

global gastrointestinal safety profile of  xxxd2069xxx  and  xxxd2517xxx 

coxib remain unchanged in patients with moderate hepatic impairment or mild to moderate renal impairment and no drug-drug interactions were seen between  xxxd2517xxx  and warfarin (sensitive
cyp2c9 substrate) [53], fluconazole (potent cyp2c9 inhibitor),
omeprazole [54], and other medications such as aspirin and
methotrexate [55].

discussion
the second generation coxibs,  xxxd2069xxx  and  xxxd2517xxx , have
demonstrated a favourable gi safety profile when compared with
ns-nsaids, and having a similar efficacy to that of the recommended therapeutic doses of ns-nsaids.
 xxxd2069xxx  is currently approved in ~60 countries for several
acute and chronic conditions. the licensed indications vary between
countries, with the highest recommended daily dose being 90mg for
chronic ra, 60mg for chronic oa and low back pain, and 120mg
for acute pain relief for primary dysmenorrhea and acute gouty
arthritis [7].  xxxd2517xxx  is a novel coxib, with improved biochemical selectivity, and which is different from other coxibs because it lacks suplhur-containing moiety and contains a carboxylic
acid group that confers weakly acidic properties.  xxxd2517xxx  is
therefore rapidly absorbed, sustaining higher concentrations in

synovial fluid versus plasma and the drug is metabolized extensively before excretion [52]. it is marketed in the uk and several
other countries for treatment of pain associated with oa, ra and
the short-term relief of moderate-to-severe acute pain associated
with primary dysmenorrhea, dental surgery or orthopaedic surgery
[3, 56].
the inhibition of prostaglandin (pg) synthesis mediated by the
cox enzyme is the major mechanism related to both the therapeutic and gi toxicity of ns-nsaids. cox-1 is expressed in most
tissues and is responsible for the maintenance of several key
physiological functions. cox-2, however, is responsible for the
synthesis of pgs in response to inflammation [57]. inhibition of
cox-2 accounts for the therapeutic (ie, anti-inflammatory) activity
and inhibition of cox-1 is responsible for the unwanted gi and
renal adverse effects. it is postulated that the injurious effects of nsnsaids are due to the inhibition of cox-1 and loss of gi mucosal
protection but also by increasing the risk of bleeding through inhibition of thromboxane (tx) a2 and platelet function [58, 59].
the highly selective inhibition of cox-2 characterizated by
 xxxd2069xxx  and  xxxd2517xxx  can explain their improved gi safety
profile.  xxxd2069xxx  is a potent selective inhibitor for cox-2 at doses
ranging from 60 to120 mg once daily, with a ratio of ic50 for cox1/cox-2 (the ratio of the concentration of the drug required to
inhibit the activity of cox-1 and cox-2 by 50%) of 106 fold in
the whole blood assay [35], which is higher than that shown for
celecoxib, rofecoxib and  xxxd3481xxx  [4].  xxxd2517xxx  is also highly
selective for cox-1/cox-2 in the human whole blood assay with a
ratio of 515: 1 in healthy subjects and in patients with oa or ra
[53], and has been reported to be as high as 400-700 [3, 60], suggesting that  xxxd2517xxx  is currently the most selective of the
coxibs.
as summarized in this review,  xxxd2069xxx  and  xxxd2517xxx  are
associated with a reduced incidence of gastric and duodenal pubs
compared with ns-nsaids and less endoscopic ulcers and symptomatic ulcers. ulcer and ulcer complications are still of great concern in clinical practice in those treated with ns-nsaids. the annual financial burden of peptic ulcer disease including direct and
indirect costs is significant [61]. although admission for uncomplicated ulcers has decreased, the incidence of complicated peptic
ulcer has remained stable or has increased [62, 63]. despite
h. pylori infection decreasing in the developed countries, an increasing incidence in ulcer bleeding has been reported in elderly
patients [63, 64], and this is partly due to the increased use of
nsaids in the elderly. elderly patients usually have co-morbid
diseases and are taking other medications such as low-dose aspirin
that puts them at increased risk of gi complications when they require nsaids. consideration of safer anti-inflammatory drugs is
important in elderly subjects and those high risk patients such as
those with a prior history of gi events [65]. in this review,  xxxd2069xxx  and  xxxd2517xxx  significantly decreased ulcer and ulcer complications in oa and ra patients, who are usually elderly and taking other medications. therefore, second generation coxibs can be
considered in elderly patients or high risk patients who required
chronic nsaids.
interference with platelet function which results in gi bleeding
is the most concerning adverse effect of ns-nsaids. txa2 is the
major product of platelet cox-1, and platelets possess only the
cox-1 isoform which is also a predominant source of txb 2
formed in serum [66]. serum txb2 is the stable, inactive product of
txa2, and its inhibition reflects the inhibition of txa2 ex vivo;
txa2 synthesis in vivo can be measured by the urinary 11-dehydrotxb2 metabolite excretion [67]. inhibition of platelet function, as
measured by bleeding time and platelet aggregation, is also indicative of cox-1 selectivity; txb2 production from platelets is usually used as a surrogate measure of cox-1 activity. in contrast to
ns-nsaids, coxibs spare the cox-1 dependent physiological function of gi cyto-protection and platelet aggregation, and are therefore associated with a lower rate of gi events and bleeding risk.

2244 current pharmaceutical design, 2007, vol. 13, no. 22

platelet cox-1 dependent aggregation through inhibition of txa 2
was not inhibited by celecoxib but was inhibited by the ns-nsaid
ibuprofen [68]. in healthy volunteers,  xxxd2069xxx  is well tolerated in
high single doses (up to 500mg) and also multiple doses (up
to150mg for 9 days) in healthy volunteers [35]. when ex-vivo lpsstimulated pge2 (cox-2 assay) is significantly inhibited, multiple
doses of  xxxd2069xxx  had no effect on serum txb2 generation (cox1 assay).  xxxd2069xxx  has no effects on bleeding time, or platelet
aggregation and does not interfere with the antiplatelet effect of
low-dose aspirin. in contrast to the significant inhibition of gastric
pge2 synthesis by naproxen,  xxxd2069xxx  does not inhibit gastric
pge2 synthesis as observed in gastric biopsies [35]. thus,  xxxd2069xxx  is associated with less gi mucosal damage and spares gastric
mucosal cox-1, the predominant source of pgs.  xxxd2069xxx  is also
associated with less risk of gi bleeding by not interfering with
bleeding time and platelet aggregation which is consistent with a
lack of platelet cox-1 inhibition and in a fecal red blood cell loss
study  xxxd2069xxx  120mg daily was similar to placebo [24]. similarly,  xxxd2517xxx  did not affect the ex vivo antiplatelet aggregation
activity of low dose-aspirin in healthy volunteers;  xxxd2517xxx 
400mg once daily showed no inhibition of  xxxd208xxx  and
collagen-induced platelet aggregation; serum txb2 levels and urinary excretion of txb2 were not affected [69]. a supra-therapeutic
dose of  xxxd2517xxx  800mg once daily for 1 week did not interfere
with platelet cox-1 activity or serum txb2 level, and did not increase biopsy induced bleeding [44]. therefore, risk of bleeding
through inhibition of txa2 does not increase, although the cox-2
inhibition selectivity increases with second generation coxibs.
it has been shown by two meta-analyses that the difference
between  xxxd2069xxx  or  xxxd2517xxx  and ns-nsaids relate to ulcer
complications in the earlier stage of exposure (fig. 2, fig. 5), the
differences between coxibs and ns-nsaids are consistent over
time. therefore, when patients with high gi complication risk require nsaids, coxibs are a good choice and very likely they will
benefit from coxibs at the time of recognition of high risk and
throughout the study.
some ra patients may need an anti-inflammatory drug when
they are already on  xxxd234xxx  for protection against cardiovascular disease. it is well known that the use of multiple nsaids
including aspirin is a risk factor for gi complications [65]. the risk
of gi ulceration and complications is believed to be lower for aspirin plus a coxib than for aspirin plus a ns-nsaid. in a populationbased retrospective cohort study of elderly canadian patients, a
coxib plus aspirin (n=100 283) caused significantly less gi risk for
hospitalization when compared with ns-nsaid plus aspirin
(n=24600) (hr 1.61, 95% ci 1.02-2.56). a coxib alone caused
significantly less risk, a coxib plus aspirin caused a similar risk, and
nsaids plus aspirin caused a significantly higher risk, compared to
users of ns-nsaids alone [70].
a coxib plus low-dose aspirin produces no more ulcers and
ulcer complications than a ns-nsaid without aspirin, as shown in a
clinical trial of aspirin, rofecoxib, and ibuprofen [71]. there is no
randomized controlled trial specifically designed to compare the gi
safety outcome of a coxib plus aspirin and an ns-nsaid plus aspirin. two meta-analyses of celecoxib in oa and ra patients both
found that celecoxib plus aspirin caused a significantly lower endoscopic ulcer rate compared with ns-nsaids plus aspirin, similarly,
rr was 0.47 (0.27, 0.83), nnt=7.3 (4.6-17) (n=5 trials) [72] and
rr was 0.49 (0.28-0.86) (n=4 trials) [1], respectively. similarly, a
meta-analysis of 3 trials of  xxxd3481xxx  in oa and ra patients found
that  xxxd3481xxx  10 or 20mg/day produced significantly fewer endoscopic ulcers than ns-nsaids in aspirin users (10% vs. 27%,
rr=0.4, 95% ci 0.2-0.9, nnt=4.5), and also in non-aspirin users
(4% vs. 11%, rr=0.4, 0.2-0.6, nnt=15) [6]. no ulcer complication data are available from meta-analyses.
no subgroup analysis in rcts shows a significant gi benefit of
a second generation coxib in patients taking low-dose aspirin compared with the ns-nsaids, as shown in the target study, neither

yuan and hunt

the first generation coxibs, eg. class study [73], but the direction
of the benefit still favors the coxib. in all available large gi outcome studies of coxibs when aspirin use was permitted, a coxib
plus aspirin caused non-significantly lower ulcer and ulcer complication rates [34, 73, 74] or a lower discontinuation rate due to gi
adverse events [75] when compared with ns-nsaids plus aspirin.
the non-significant advantage seen in clinical trials is due to the
absolute risk reduction in the aspirin users, and the sample size of
clinical trials that were designed for a primary outcome (in overall
patients or non-aspirin users) but not for subgroup analysis (aspirin
users). the benefit of coxibs in such a small subgroup (~24%)
population is hard to observe unless the total sample size is very
large. these patients are at higher risk of gi ulcers or ulcer complications since two nsaids are used and aspirin is also ulcerogenic
and increases the risk of gi complications [76]. no clinical trials
have compared a second generation coxib and a  xxxg215xxx  inhibitor (ppi) plus an ns-nsaid. in the current guidelines, a ppi
plus an ns-nsaids or a coxib may be the choice for those on aspirin with or without a history of gi events, or those who had a prior
gi event even when not on aspirin [77]. in patients with a history of
ulcer bleeding, a ppi plus a coxib is the best approach [78].
ra patients frequently also take corticosteroids which places
them at increased risk of gi complications [79]. stable, low-dose
corticosteroids ( 7.5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) were
included in two ra efficacy studies of  xxxd2517xxx  [50, 51] and
were included in the meta-analysis by hawkey [16]. no data was
reported in regard to the gi safety in the subgroup of corticosteroids
users or non-users. in the vigor study, glucocorticoids were permitted and used in about 56% of the ra subjects; gi events were
significantly lower in rofecoxib users than in naproxen users in the
subgroup taking compared with not taking glucocorticoids, and a
non-significantly greater relative risk reduction was seen in those
taking glucocorticoids than in subgroup not taking glucocorticoids
[33]. up to two short-term (2 week) courses of systemic corticosteroids were allowed in the target study, but no gi complication
data was available on these patients [34]. in the three studies of
 xxxd2069xxx  in ra patients, low dose corticosteroids (prednisone <
10 mg daily) were allowed to continue during therapy in 32% [80],
37% [24] and 57% of the patients [81]. no data reported a reduced
rr with  xxxd2069xxx  comparing corticosteroid users or non-users. it
is not known whether the benefit of coxibs will be decreased in
corticosteroid users, especially in those taking high dose corticosteroids.
