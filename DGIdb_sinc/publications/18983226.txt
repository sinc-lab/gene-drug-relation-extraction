prostanoids for the management of glaucoma.  prostanoids are the newest pharmacologic group of ocular hypotensive drugs for clinical management of glaucoma. the group includes four chemical compounds structurally derived from naturally-occurring prostaglandin (pg) f(2). prostanoids have been divided into pg analogues (unoprostone,  xxxd2446xxx  and  xxxd3414xxx ) and prostamides ( xxxd340xxx ) because of differences in molecular structures. the drugs share a novel mechanism of action that produces a potent ocular hypotensive effect and a novel local adverse effect of increased iridial pigmentation.
