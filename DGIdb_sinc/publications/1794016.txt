summary
synopsis
selegiline (deprenyl) is a selective inhibitor ofcerebral molloamine oxidase type b at the dosage
(10 mg/day) used in patients with parkinson's disease. through this activity, the drug increases
nigrostriatal dopamine levels, and may protect neurons against damage by free radicals and possibly exogenous neurotoxins. selegiline also inhibits dopamine reuptake from the synaptic cleft.
because of its selectivity, selegiline lomg daily does not prevent the breakdown and exacerbate
the indirect pressor effects of dietary amines such as tyramine; it is devoid of the 'cheese' effect.
following oral administration, selegiline is rapidly metabolised to  xxxd2589xxx  and
 xxxd163xxx , which may account for the euphoria and insomnia seen in many patients, although potentiation of dopaminergic activity with concurrent levodopa appears more likely. the
drug is a useful adjunct to levodopa in parkinsonism, improving 'end-ofdose' fluctuations, producing modest improvements in motor function, and allowing a reduction in levodopa dosage.
indeed, if levodopa dosages are not decreased when selegiline is added to the therapeutic regimen,
peak concentration dyskinesias due to levodopa are often exacerbated. however, symptomatic benefits are rarely maintained for more than a year and selegiline is relatively ineffective in allaying
the abrupt swings in response to levodopa ('on/off' effects). when used alone in patients with mild
disease, selegiline appears to slow the rate ofsymptom progression and may extend survival, through
either neuroprotection or symptom relief whichever mechanism(s) is responsible, there is strong
evidence to suggest that selegiline should be considered both in patients newly diagnosed with
parkinson's disease in an attempt to delay symptom progression, and in those experiencing dosedependent fluctuations in response to levodopa.

pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties
at the dosage recommended for use in patients with parkinson's disease (10 mgjday), selegiline is an irreversible selective inhibitor of  xxxg1358xxx  (mao-b), an enzyme
responsible for dopamine metabolism in the brain. post mortem studies in recipients of selegiline
and levodopa indicate about 90% inhibition of nigrostriatal mao-b activity resulting in a 70%
increase in dopamine levels compared with untreated patients with parkinson's disease.
deamination of dopamine by mao-b produces oxygen free radicals, which may be implicated
in the progressive nigrostriatal degeneration in idiopathic parkinson's disease. selegiline should
therefore limit this oxidative stress by blocking mao-b, and indeed this hypothesis has been
supported by animal studies. mao-b also catalyses the formation of the neurotoxic i-methyl-4phenylpyridinium ion (mpp+) from l-methyl-4-phenyl-i,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (mptp), a
compound which causes symptoms and pathology very similar to those of idiopathic parkinsonism. pretreatment with selegiline prevented the signs and symptoms of mptp-induced neuronal
damage in animals.
dopaminergic function is also enhanced by the ability of selegiline to block synaptic dopamine
reuptake.
because selegiline is extensively and rapidly metabolised, mainly to  xxxd2589xxx , lamphetamine and demethyl-selegiline, pharmacokinetic analysis to date is limited. the parent
drug is undetectable following oral administration, but peak serum concentrations of the metabolites occurred within 0.5 to 2 hours with an absorption half-life of 24 minutes. mean serum
concentrations of  xxxd2589xxx ,  xxxd163xxx  and demethyl-selegiline were 9, 1.3 and
5.8 i'gjl, respectively, after selegiline 10 mgjday orally for 22 to 24 months in 4 patients with
parkinson's disease. selegiline is extensively distributed, despite being 94% bound to plasma proteins, and binds to striatum, cortex and brain stem. renal elimination is the predominant route
of selegiline excretion, with 86% of an oral dose recovered in the urine, principally as  xxxd2589xxx  (59%) and  xxxd163xxx  (26%).

therapeutic use
selegiline iomg daily has been investigated as a supplement to standard levodopa plus decarboxylase inhibitor regimens in an attempt to smooth out response fluctuations, and as monotherapy in patients with early mild disease to try to slow symptom progression of parkinson's
disease.
the many noncomparative and placebo-controlled studies demonstrated that the addition of
selegiline to levodopa improved the disability rating scores by 18 to 32%, compared with 8 to
27% in placebo recipients. tremor was more frequently relieved than rigidity. the dosage of
levodopa was reduced by approximately 10 to 30% without adversely affecting the degree of
symptom control. 'end-of-dose' fluctuations in response to levodopa significantly improved in
50 to 63% of se1egiline recipients, and early morning akinesias in 56%, but the drug had no
significant effect in improving 'on/off' oscillations. moreover, the benefits of adding selegiline
declined with time, with a reduction in both the proportion of adequately controlled patients and
the extent of improvement; the mean duration of benefit was 7 to 8 months in 1 long term study.
a retrospective study suggested that addition of selegiline to a levodopa regimen extended life
expectancy by 15 months.
encouraging results have been obtained with selegiline monotherapy in patients with early
and mildly symptomatic parkinson's disease. prospective trials revealed that selegiline monotherapy delayed, but did not prevent, the progression of symptoms and prolonged mobility without additionallevodopa by 6 to 11 months. after 12 months, 26 to 44% of selegiline recipients
compared with 47 to 56% of placebo-treated patients had symptoms sufficiently severe to justify
starting levodopa therapy. it is unclear if these results are a consequence of protection against
further neuronal destruction or are symptomatic effects. the latter seems less likely since selegiline alone provides little symptom relief.

tolerability
selegiline does not significantly inhibit mao type a at therapeutic doses used to treat parkinson's disease. it is therefore not associated with the 'cheese' effect, which occurs when the
indirect pressor effects of dietary amines (e.g. tyramine) are exacerbated because of accumulation
resulting from nonselective mao inhibition. headache has, however, been reported by 4 to 26%
of patients and a single hypertensive episode has been documented. orthostatic hypotension,
occasionally causing syncope, has occurred in several patients.
because it potentiates striatal dopaminergic activity, selegiline exacerbates peak concentration
dyskinesias due to levodopa in' approximately 28% of patients. symptoms usually resolve when
the levodopa dosage is reduced.
mood elevation (in 6 of 11 patients), insomnia (in 10 to 32%; similar to levodopa alone),
hallucinations '(in 2 to 9%) and confusion (in 5 to 10%) have occurred during coadministration
of selegiline and levodopa, indicating- caution when introducing selegiline in some elderly demented patients. the most likely cause of these effects appears to be increased dopaminergic
activity, but there is possibly some contribution from the selegiline metabolites  xxxd2589xxx  and  xxxd163xxx  since insomnia and euphoria have been noted during selegiline
monotherapy. gastrointestinal symptoms, primarily nausea, occur in 12% of selegiline recipients,
and pre-existing peptic ulcer may be exacerbated.

drug interactions

the concurrent use ofselegiline with pethidine (meperidine) is contraindicated, and fluoxetine
should be avoided. coadministration of medications-containing sympathomimetic amines (e.g.
cold remedies) appears to be safe if the daily dosage of selegiline does not exceed iomg.

selegiline: a review

231

dosage and administration
in the treatment of patients with parkinson's disease, selegiline smg orally twice daily, with
breakfast and. at. midday, is recommended. higher dosages are no more effective than 10 mgj
day, and restnctlon of both tyramine-containing food and indirect sympathomimetic medications
may be necessary above this dosage.

1. overview of pharmacological properties
1.1 effect on dopamine metabolism
selegiline (deprenyl) [fig. 1] was first described
in the mid-1960s (knoll et al. 1965) and at therapeutic doses in humans is a selective inhibitor of
cerebral  xxxg1358xxx  (mao-b). the
drug binds covalently and irreversibly to the flavinadenin dinucleotide (fad) cofactor of the enzyme
(fowler et al. 1980; kalir et al. 1981; youdim 1978).
mao-b constitutes about 80% of the total mao
activity in the human brain (riederer et al. 1978;
sonsalla & golbe 1988) and is the predominant
form of the enzyme in the striatum (riederer et al.
1989). it is responsible for metabolism of dopamine in human brain homogenates (glover et al.
1977) and in the striatum (glover et al. 1980), although mao type a (mao-a) may also be involved (sonsalla & golbe 1988) [fig. 2].
platelet mao activity, which is all type b (donnelly & murphy 1977), was decreased by about 85%
within 2 to 4 hours of a single oral dose of selegiline 5mg in groups of 5, 10 and 79 patients with
parkinson's disease (birkmayer et al. 1977; lee et
al. 1989; riederer et al. 1978). 90 minutes after a
single oral dose of selegiline 10mg, platelet  xxxg1358xxx  activity was reduced by over 90% in 10 patients
(riederer et al. 1978), and was inhibited by at least
98% in 85 others after 2 to 6 months' daily treat-

ment with this dose (elsworth et al. 1978; lee et
al. 1989). this level of enzyme inhibition was
reached within 24 hours, with no significant difference between a single daily dose of selegiline
iomg and 5mg twice daily (lee et al. 1989). platelet mao-b activity was absent in 4 patients and 4
healthy volunteers i day after daily treatment with
selegiline iomg was stopped (elsworth et al. 1978),
and had only recovered to 4% of the baseline value
in 79 other patients 5 days after therapy ceased (lee
et al. 1989).
compared with 5 nonparkinsonian control subjects, dopamine deamination by mao-b was reduced by 94% in substantia nigra homogenate
preparations, and by a mean of 92% (range 86 to
95%) in other brain areas in a post mortem study
of 7 elderly patients with parkinson's disease who
had received long term levodopa therapy plus selegiline 10 mg/day for a mean of6 days before death
(riederer & youdim 1986). consequently, dopamine levels were about 70% higher in the substantia nigra of selegiline recipients compared with
patients with parkinson's disease who did not receive the drug. serotonin levels were unaffected. it
is unclear if striatal dopamine levels are increased
by selegiline alone (langston 1990).
selegiline is relatively selective for mao-b
rather than mao-a in vitro (glover et al. 1977),
but selectivity is less marked at therapeutic dosages
in humans. brain mao-a activity, determined post
mortem by serotonin metabolism, was inhibited by
between 38 and 84% (mean 66%) in 7 patients given
selegiline 10 mg/day for a mean of 6 days before
death (riederer & youdim 1986). seven days'
treatment with selegiline 100 mg/day completely
inhibited brain mao-a activity in i patient (riederer et al. 1978), but such a high dosage is not normally used in patients with parkinson's disease.

1.2 neuroprotective effects
1.2.1 free radical involvement
oxidation of dopamine by mao-b in the nigrostriatal pathway yields  xxxd2298xxx  as a
by-product (fig. 3) [cohen & spina 1989; sonsalla
& golbe 1988). while  xxxd2298xxx  can cause
cellular damage by acting as an oxidising agent, it
is normally eliminated as water following the action of catalase or glutathione peroxidase (halli-

well 1989; sonsalla & golbe 1988). however, in
the presence of  xxxd2385xxx  (fe++) and the superoxide radical,  xxxd2298xxx  can form hydroxyl ions and highly reactive hydroxyl radicals
(halliwell 1989; sonsalla & golbe 1988). this species of free radical may react with cellular dna,
carbohydrates and proteins, and can cause lipid
peroxidation which severely disrupts membrane
function and leads to cell death (halliwell 1989;
sonsalla & golbe 1988). the gradual decline in the

selegiline: a review

number of dopaminergic nigral neurons, such as
occurs in parkinson's disease, and perhaps in normal aging, may result in a compensatory increase
in dopamine turnover and hence free radical production in remaining neurons (cohen & spina
1989; sonsalla & golbe 1988; tetrud & langston
1987). indeed, mao-b activity tends to be elevated with age (fowler et a!. 1980). this risk of
oxidative damage to nigrostriatal dopaminergic
neurons appears to be exacerbated by deficient detoxification mechanisms such as occurs in patients
with parkinson's disease.
post mortem studies revealed that glutathione
peroxidase activity was 19% lower in the substantia nigra of patients with idiopathic parkinson's
disease compared with neurologically normal adults
(kish et a!. 1985), and the  xxxd2213xxx  cofactor was also severely depleted (perry et a!. 1982;
perry & yong 1986; riederer et a!. 1989). conversely, elevations in mitochondrial (saggu et a!.
1989) and total superoxide dismutase ~ctivity
(marttila et a!. 1988) have been documented in
substantia nigra from patients with parkinson's
disease, compared with healthy tissue. selegiline,
in a dose-proportional manner, increased striatal
superoxide dismutase activity in rats (carrillo et
a!. 1991; knoll 1989; sandler, personal communication). since superoxide dismutase catalyses
conversion of damaging superoxide radicals to  xxxd2298xxx  and molecular oxygen (halliwell
1989), increased activity may be a protective reaction to high superoxide levels but may result in
 xxxd2298xxx  accumulation (saggu et a!. 1989).

233

inhibition of mao-b by selegiline may limit the
formation of  xxxd2298xxx  resulting from elevated nigrostriatal dopamine turnover in idiopathic parkinsonism (fig. 3), and therefore protect
remaining dopaminergic neurons from oxygen radical-induced degeneration (marsden 1990; tetrud
& langston 1~87). evidence to support this hypothesis was provided by cohen and spina (1989)
who showed that the increased striatal dopamine
turnover caused by haloperidol injection in mice
elevated  xxxd2811xxx  levels 3-fold, suggesting a rise in  xxxd2298xxx  production.
pretreatment with selegiline 2.5 mg/kg inhibited the
generation of  xxxd2811xxx  by 72%.
1.2.2 role of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-l,2, 3,6tetrahydropyridine (mptp)
mptp is a neurotoxin which selectively destroys neurons in the substantia nigra and causes
symptoms virtually indistinguishable from those of
idiopathic parkinson's disease in humans (ballard
et a!. 1985; davis et a!. 1979; langston et a!. 1983)
and in nonhuman primates (burns et a!. 1983; jenner et a!. 1984; langston et a!. 1984). it has been
suggested that parkinson's disease may therefore
be at least partly attributable to a toxin such as
mptp (lewin 1985a; marsden 1990; sonsalla &
golbe 1988). however, to destroy nigral neurons
mptp must first be oxidised to the i-methyl-4phenylpyridinium ion (mpp+) by mao-b (chiba
et a!. 1984; sonsalla & golbe 1988). mpp+ accumulates in nigral neurons via the dopamine uptake
system (javitch & snyder 1984), where it causes

cell death by inhibiting mitochondrial complex i
oxidation, reducing  xxxd83xxx  production and increasing intracellular calcium (marsden 1990; sonsalla & golbe 1988; tetrud & langston 1989). toxic free radicals may also be generated
in the formation of mpp+ (rossetti et al. 1988).
when administered intra peritoneally before
mptp, selegiline 2.5 or 10 mg/kg in mice prevented the mptp-induced neuronal damage, demonstrated by maintenance of neostriatal dopamine
content (cohen et al. 1984; fuller & hemrickluecke 1989; heikkila et al. 1984). unlike monkeys receiving mptp alone, those given selegiline
did not become akinetic (cohen et al. 1984). selegiline 0.01 to 10 mg/kg also limited behavioural
abnormalities caused by mptp in mice, and increased the lethal dose of mptp (fuller et al. 1988;
fuller & hemrick-luecke 1989). in contrast, toxicity .following direct injection of mpp+ was unaffected by selegiline in mice, indicating that inhibition of mao-b oxidation of mptp to mpp+
is central to the protective effect of selegiline against
this neurotoxin (bradbury et al. 1985; fuller et al.
1988). administration of selegiline for 16 weeks
beginning 4 days after mptp injection also did not
prevent mpp+-induced striatal dopamine depletion in mice (wiener et al. 1989).
1.3 mechanism of action
selective inhibition of mao-b in the nigrostriatal pathway is the principal pharmacological activity on which most of the other effects of selegiline depend: an increase in nigrostriatal dopamine
levels, a reduction in oxygen free radical generation, and possibly prevention of exogenous neurotoxin formation (e.g. mpp+) [knoll 1986, 1988,
1989].
dopaminergic activity in the substantia nigra is
enhanced during selegiline administration because
of inhibition of mao-b-mediated metabolism.
blockade of presynaptic dopamine receptors and
inhibition of dopamine reuptake from the synapse
by selegiline has also been suggested to contribute
to the increased dopamine levels (knoll 1987). it
is by these processes that selegiline potentiates the

efficacy of levodopa in the symptomatic treatment
of parkinson's disease (see section 2.1). it is unlikely that the major metabolites of selegiline, lmethamphetamine and  xxxd163xxx  (see section 1.4.3), contribute to the effects of selegiline on
parkinsonian symptoms (heinonen et al. 1989b).
the l-isomers ~ormed during selegiline metabolism are about 25% less active than the d-enantiomers (karoumet et al. 1982; sandler, personal
communication), and a slight improvement in parkinsonian disability of about 20% following  xxxd163xxx  administration only occurred with a
daily dose of 50mg (parkes et al. 1975).
selegiline may also slow disease progression by
protecting the nigral neurons against damage by
oxygen free radicals generated during mao-b activity (see section 1.2.1). furthermore, selegiline
prevents mao-b-mediated production of the neurotoxin mpp+ in the mptp model of parkinsonism, suggesting that the drug could protect against
neuronal degeneration if an exogenous neurotoxin
contributes to the development of parkinson's disease (see section 1.2.2). rinne et al. (1990) estimated that, in 10 patients with parkinson's disease,
selegiline treatment was associated with a significantly larger population of neurons in the medial
substantia nigra and that lewy bodies (a marker
of degeneration) in these neurons were less common compared with 15 patients not receiving selegiline. further, knoll (1988, 1989) reported that
selegiline prolongs the lifespan of healthy rats.
1.4 pharmacokinetic properties
few studies to date have investigated the pharmacokinetics of selegiline in humans. these investigations have been conducted in healthy
volunteers and in patients with parkinson's disease. there are no data presently available on the
effects of renal or liver impairment on the disposition of the drug.
analysis ofthe pharmacokinetics of selegiline is
limited by the fact that following oral administration of therapeutic doses, the concentration of parent drug in serum or urine is too low to be detected

selegiline: a review

by currently available analytical methods due to
first pass metabolism and extensive distribution
(heinonen et al. 1989b). thus, the main metabolites of selegiline, demethyl-selegiline,  xxxd2589xxx  and  xxxd163xxx , are measured instead of the parent drug. a gas chromatographymass spectrometry method, with a detection limit
of about 10 ilg/l for selegiline, has been used to
measure concentrations of selegiline and its metabolites.
1.4.1 absorption
animal studies using 14c-labelled selegiline have
demonstrated that the drug is rapidly absorbed from
the gastrointestinal tract (magyar & tothfalusi
1984). there are limited published data on the absorption of selegiline in humans. absorption of selegiline in humans is also relatively rapid, with peak
metabolite serum concentrations achieved within
0.5 to 2 hours and an absorption half-life of 24
minutes (heinonen et al. i 989b). in 12 healthy
volunteers, mean peak serum concentrations of lmethamphetamine and  xxxd163xxx  were 40
and 30 ilg/l, respectively, after a single oral dose
of selegiline 10mg, and 40 ilg/l and 20 ilg/l, respectively, following selegiline iomg daily for 7 days
(meeker & reynolds 1990). mean trough serum
concentrations of  xxxd2589xxx  and  xxxd163xxx  wer6 8 ilg/l and 3.5 ilg/l, respectively,
during repeat administration (package insert, somerset pharmaceuticals). these data suggest that
accumulation of metabolites does not occur.
as selegiline is undetectable in serum after oral
administration, concentrations of the main metabolites of the drug were measured in patients with
parkinson's disease after administration of a iomg
daily dose for 22 to 24 months (heinonen et al.
1989b). the mean serum concentrations of demethyl-selegiline,  xxxd2589xxx  and  xxxd163xxx  in 4 patients were 5.8, 9 and 1.3 ilg/l,
respectively, while the csf concentrations of these
metabolites in 9 other patients (mean age 62 years)
were 6.3, 14.2 and 0.7 ilg/l, respectively (heinonen et al. 1989b).

235

1.4.2 distribution
following oral or intravenous administration of
14c-labelled selegiline to mice, the parent drug and/
or metabolites were distributed extensively and
rapidly, with especially high concentrations appearing in the brain, liver, kidney, lung, heart and
brown fat (magyar & tothfalusi 1984). there are
few published studies in humans but it has been
reported that selegiline is 94% bound to plasma
proteins at therapeutic concentrations (heinonen
et al. 1989b). the drug has a volume of distribution of about 300l, which is consistent with its extensive distribution (heinonen et al. 1989b).
there is good evidence that selegiline and its
metabolites can cross the human blood-brain barrier easily. positron emission tomography studies
of intravenously administered iic-labelled selegiline in 4 healthy volunteers demortstrated that the
drug binds to the thalamus, striatum, cortex and
brainstem; these regions are high in mao-b content (fowler et al. 1987). furthermore, post mortem analysis of human brain tissue from 4 patients
with parkinson's disease who had been receiving
selegiline 5 to 10mg for 3 to 8 days, revealed the
presence of the metabolite  xxxd163xxx  in concentrations up to 56 ng/g (reynolds et al. 1978b).
1.4.3 metabolism
selegiline is extensively metabolised in humans,
mainly in the liver, to form  xxxd2589xxx 
and demethyl-selegiline which are further metabolised to  xxxd163xxx  (golbe et al. 1990; reynolds et al. 1978a; yoshida et al. 1986). the precise
pathways of selegiline metabolism in humans have
yet to be elucidated but studies in animals have
suggested that the enzymes responsible for metabolism are the cytochrome p45o-dependent monooxygenases. furthermore,  xxxd2589xxx  and
 xxxd163xxx  may also be metabolised to their
corresponding para-hydroxylated metabolites, phydroxy-methamphetamine and p-hydroxy-amphetamine which are then rendered inactive by
glucuronic acid conjugation (yoshida et al. 1986).
in vitro studies have demonstrated that selegiline may be metabolised in the lungs or kidneys to
form demethyl-selegiline and the  xxxd163xxx 

236

metabolites. however, compared with the liver,
these sites contribute little to the overall metabolism of selegiline (yoshida et al. 1986).
there may be a sex-related difference in the degree of in vitro hepatic metabolism of selegiline into
the 3 metabolites: male rats reportedly had 2- to
5-fold greater rates than female rats (yoshida et al.
1986). this phenomenon has yet to be demonstrated in humans. the precise contribution of these
metabolites to the clinical efficacy and adverse effects of selegiline is unknown (golbe et al. 1990)
[see sections 1.3 and 3.3].
1.4.4 excretion
in 12 healthy volunteers, 45% of a single 10mg
oral dose of selegiline was recovered in the urine
within 48 hours as  xxxd2589xxx ,  xxxd163xxx  and demethyl-selegiline (package insert,
somerset pharmaceuticals). after the oral administration of selegiline 10mg to 4 patients with parkinson's disease, 86% of the dose was recovered in
the urine within 24 hours as metabolites:  xxxd2589xxx  (59%),  xxxd163xxx  (26%) and
demethyl selegiline (1%). parent drug was undetectable in urine (heinonen et al. 1989b). this pattern of excretion is consistent with the findings of
other studies (karoum et. al. 1982; reynolds et al.
1978a), although the differences in concentration
of the metabolites measured in different studies
may be due to limitations of the analytical methods
used.
it has been reported that urinary ph also influences the excretion of the amphetamine metabolites in humans (beckett & rowland 1965a,b); excretion is increased with acidic urine and decreased
if the urine is alkaline. the clinical significance of
this finding was assessed by elsworth et al. (1982)
in a study of 5 patients with parkinson's disease
who were receiving levodopa 600mg and a decarboxylase inhibitor, and selegiline 5 to 45mg daily.
varying the urinary ph between 6.5 to 7.4 produced marked changes in the excretion rate of lmethamphetamine and  xxxd163xxx . however,
the clinical response of the patients to selegiline
was unaltered.

2. therapeutic use in parkinson's disease
idiopathic parkinson's disease is believed to occur in 1% of all individuals aged 60 years or over
(nutt 1990), with the incidence apparently increasing with advancing age (marsden 1990). clinically,
the disease is chat:acterised by resting tremor, lead
pipe and cogwheel rigidity, flexed posture and slow,
stiff gait. it has been suggested that dementia is
apparent in 15 to 20% of patients with parkinson's
disease (nutt 1990).
clinical manifestations of idiopathic parkinsonism are caused by disrupted dopaminergic neurotransmission in the nigrostriatal pathway as a result of relative depletion of the neurotransmitter,
dopamine. this is caused by characteristic destruction of pigmented brainstem nuclei, particularly
dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra (nutt
1990). destruction of noradrenergic neurons in the
locus coeruleus also occurs (marsden 1990), and
the mental impairment which develops in some
patients may result in part from degeneration of
cholinergic neurons in the substantia innominata
(marsden 1990). the disease is progressive, with
continuous neuronal destruction. since it was first
used in patients with parkinson's disease in 1975
(birkmayer et al. 1975), selegiline has been studied
extensively as an adjunct to standard levodopa
therapy (usually with a decarboxylase inhibitor) in
short and long term noncomparative and placebocontrolled trials (table i).
the effect on parkinsonian signs and symptoms
has also been evaluated in some studies, although
comparability among study results is difficult since
disability wa,s assessed using a variety of methods,
including the modified columbia university, the
northwestern university, the webster and the
unified parkinson's disease disability rating scales.
2.1 selegiline in combination with levodopa
although most patients improve with levodopa
therapy, long term administration is occasionally
associated with abrupt, often severe, swings in motor functioning (the 'on/off' phenomenon) and frequently with a gradual diminishing or 'wearing-off'

oflevodopa efficacy (lees 1989). the principal aim
of most investigations of selegiline as an adjunct
to standard levodopa therapy was to assess the efficacy of selegiline in ameliorating fluctuations in
parkinsonian treatment response to long term levodopa. a number of double-blind studies have
compared selegiline 10 mg/day with placebo as an
adjunct to levodopa in relatively small patient
groups, usually over periods of 2 to 18 (mean 8)
weeks (section 2.1.2) [table i]. most patients were
poorly controlled on their existing levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor regimen.
2.1.1 noncomparative studies
in 1975, birkmayer and colleagues found that
addition of selegiline at an average dose of 10mg
orally twice daily to levodopa/benserazide reduced
the disability score of 44 patients by a mean of 43%
(birkmayer et al. 1975). 'on/off' phenomena were
relieved in 21 of 32 affected patients (66%).
other short term (i.e. ~ 3 months) trials also
indicated that selegiline 5mg twice daily attenuated
fluctuations in response to levodopa.· the time
spent 'off' significantly decreased by approximately
36 to 40% in 2 groups of 6 and 76 patients (cedarbaum et al. 1990; ruggieri et al. 1986), and
'wearing-off' or 'on/off' fluctuations improved in
26 of 45 others (58%) [rinne 1983]. the daily levodopa dosage necessary for adequate symptom
control was reducible by between 22 and 50% with
addition of selegiline to the therapeutic regimen
(cedarbaum et al. 1990; giovannini et al. 1985;
ruggieri et al. 1986).
longer term studies, ranging from 6 months to
4 years in duration, have also demonstrated a
beneficial effect of adjunctive selegiline administration. in a total of 234 patients, concomitant selegiline 5mg once or twice daily improved mean
disability scores by 20 to 34% compared with levodopa/benserazide alone after 6 to 7 months'
treatment, with noticeable effects within 1 hour of
administration (birkmayer et al. 1977; rinne 1983).
in terms of response rate, motor function had improved by at least 20% 6 to 18 months after the
addition of selegiline 5mg twice daily in 37 to 50%
of just over 200 patients with fluctuations in re-

drugs & aging 1 (3) 1991

sponse to levodopa (elizan et al. 1989a; giovannini et al. 1986; poewe et al. 1987). improvement
was more noticeable in patients with recently diagnosed and/or previously untreated parkinson's
disease. the disability score decreased by >20% in
13 of 19 patients (68%) with a disease duration of
less than 2 years (giovannini et al. 1986) and by
>50% in 19 ~f 21 (90%) previously untreated
patients (yahr et al. 1989) after a respective mean
of 8 and 15 months' adjuvant selegiline treatment.
fluctuations in the response to levodopa did not
develop during 15 months' selegiline supplementation in the latter study.
six months after the addition of selegiline 5mg
twice daily the overall motor status of 39 of 85
patients (46%) with end-of-dose deterioration improved compared with levodopa alone (elizan et
al. 1989a). however, the response declined over
time, with 30 of 77 patients (39%) showing continued benefit after 2 years, and only 9 of 52 (17%)
still receiving their original effective selegiline dosage after 4 years. this level of response was nevertheless better than that achieved by adding selegiline to the levodopa regimen of 28 patients with
'on/off' oscillations to levodopa. six patients (21 %)
improved after 6 months, decreasing to 4 of 27
(14%) after a year, and 2 (7%) at 2 to 4 years' follow-up (elizan et al. 1989a). similarly, 3 to 12
months' treatment with selegiline 5 or 10 mg/day
alleviated random and/or end-of-dose fluctuations
in all 11 evaluable patients in another study, but
this decreased to 6 of 8 after 2 years and 4 of 6
after 3 to 4 years (rinne 1983). the degree of improvement also became smaller, and again those
patients with random 'on/off fluctuations benefited less than those with 'wearing-off' effects.
'wearing-off of response to levodopa developed in
2 patients after 2 and 3 years' selegiline treatment.
csanda et al. (1983) reported that selegiline was
ineffective in ameliorating 'on/off' effects in 9
patients. furthermore, dyskinesias associated with
peak concentrations of levodopa tended to become
more common and more severe during concomitant selegiline therapy, often despite a 20 to 30%
reduction in levodopa dosage (see section 3.2) [cedarbaum et al. 1990; csanda et al. 1983; giovan-

selegiline: a review

nini et al. 1986; poewe et al. 1987; rinne 1983].
elizan et al. (1991) reported the progress of 26
patients with early disease symptoms (mean hoehn
and yahr stage 2.2) receiving selegiline 10 mgjday
and an average levodopa dose of 389 mgjday for
a mean of 26 months as -initial therapy. in 18
patients levodopa was added to an existing selegiline monotherapy regimen because of worsening
disability after a mean of 19.8 months (see section
2.2), while the remaining 8 patients began receiving both drugs simultaneously. mean disability
scores improved by a mean of 65% in 24 of the 26
patients (92%), with a ~ 50% improvement in 18
(69%). mean motor disability scores had deteriorated by 36% compared with baseline just before
combined therapy was started, but they improved
by 57% compared with this score (41% compared
with baseline score). such a dramatic alleviation of
motor disability was not observed with selegiline
alone.
2.1.2 comparisons with placebo
double-blind placebo-controlled studies give a
better indication of the relative merits of adding
selegiline to a levodopa-containing regimen in
poorly controlled patients. addition of selegiline
reduced disability scores by 18 to 32% in some
patients (heinonen et al. 1989a; lieberman et al.
1987; presthus & hajba 1983; presthus et al. 1987;
przuntek & kuhn 1987; rascol et al. 1988) [table
i]. however, placebo administration also decreased mean disability ratings by 8 to 27% (heinonen et al. 1989a; lieberman et al. 1987; presthus
et al. 1987; przuntek & kuhn 1987; rascol et al.
1988), there was often no significant difference between the degree of improvement during selegiline
or placebo administration (table i), and indeed selegiline occasionally had no effect on disability
(brodersen et al. 1985; golbe et al. 1988a; lees et
al. 1977; sivertsen et al. 1989). tremor was the
symptom best relieved by selegiline, and rigidity
improved the least (eisler et al. 1981; golbe et al.
1988a; heinonen et al. 1989a; sivertsen et al. 1989).
the lack of effect of selegiline on parkinsonian
motor function may be explained in some studies
by an aim to reduce the dosage of concomitant le-

239

vodopa while maintaining the same degree of
clinical control. levodopa requirements were reduced by up to 33% (mean 21%) in selegiline-treated
patients, which was usually significantly greater
than the reductions of up to 27% (mean 12%)
achieved with placebo (table i). the largest decreases in levod0p.8 dosage occurred within the first
1 or 2 months of selegili~e therapy in 2 studies
(presthus & hajba 1983i sivertsen et al. 1989).
fluctuations in response to levodopa were attenuated by selegiline in some studies, although the
effects were not as impressive as those suggested
by noncomparative studies (see section 2.1.1). disability due to 'wearing-off' ofl~odopa efficacy significantly decreased during selegiline treatment
compared with placebo (heinonen et al. 1989a;
schachter et al. 1980; teychenne & parker 1989)
in 50 to 63% of patients (lees et al. 1977; presthus
& hajba 1983) [tabie i]. end-of-dose deterioration
was abolish~d within 2 days qf beginning selegiiine
in 1 patient (lees et al. 1977). early morning akinesias resulting from 'wearing-off' of levodopa efficacy were also improved by selegiline in 56% of
affected patients (lees et al. 1977; presthus & hajba
1983). however, in 15 patients with end-of-dose
deterioration, 2 weeks' therapy with selegiline 10
mgjday had no significant effect on the degree or
duration of response to a single dose of levodopa/
benserazide 200/50mg following a 2-day drug holiday (rascol et al. 1988).
selegiline was much less effective in ameliorating 'on/off' and 'freezing' oscillations, generally
having little or no effecc(golbe et al. 1988a; heinonen et al. 1989a; lees et al. 1977; lieberman et
al. 1987). schachter and colleagues (1980) reported
that although hourly mobility and dyskinesia
tended to improve in 7 patients with 'on/off' phenomena during selegiline treatment, the duration
of 'off' periods associated with severe akinesia increased, resulting in more marked swings in response. conversely, the duration of severe immobility was shortened by selegiline in 10 patients
with 'wearing-off' effects, but overall mobility and
dyskinesia did not improve. nine of the latter 10
patients preferred selegiline _over placebo, compared with 2 of the other group of 7 patients with

240

'on/off' fluctuations. overall, in crossover studies,
between 21 and 57% of patients preferred se1egiline, 21 to 37% preferred placebo and 10 to 57%
expressed no preference (brodersen et al. 1985;
heinonen et al. 1989a; presthus et al. 1987).
as indicated in the noncomparative studies
(section 2.1.1), the beneficial effects of selegiline on
levodopa response fluctuations gradually waned.
eight of 18 patients who chose to maintain selegiline therapy after a 20-week double-blind crossover phase developed end-of-dose deterioration
compared with none of 12 who elected for placebo
after a mean follow-up of 16 months (sivertsen et
at. 1989). similarly, of 22 patients who continued
to receive supplemental selegiline for 19 to 27
months after a 6-week double-blind placebo comparison (golbe et al. 1988a), 6 discontinued selegiline because of a recurrence of dyskinesia after a
mean of 8.2 months; 10 others continued to receive selegiline despite subjective recurrence of
symptoms after a mean of 7 months; and 5 retained their original degree of improvement, aided
in 3 cases by additional supplementation with bromocriptine (golbe 1989).
birkmayer et al. (1985) retrospectively analysed
the effects on survival and disability of adding selegiline to levodopa (with benserazide) for up to 9
years. the mean daily dose oflevodopa was 524mg
in monotherapy recipients and 628mg in those receiving'additional selegiline, reflecting greater disease severity. the estimated mean survival times
were 129 months in 377 levodopa monotherapy
recipients, compared with 144.5 months in 564
others given supplemental selegiline 5 or lomg
daily, a significant (p < 0.001) difference of over
15 months. 171 of 377 (45%) levodopa-treated
patients compared with 375 of 564 (66%) levodopa
plus selegiline recipients remained alive after 9
years. the increase in life-expectancy in the group
receiving selegiline was still significant (p < 0.01)
when confounding covariates had been considered,
and in all age groups including those aged over 75
years.
2.2 selegiline monotherapy
the encouraging retrospective results of birkmayer et al. (1985) and the discovery that mao

drugs & aging 1 (3) 1991

inhibition could prevent mptp-induced parkinsonism (section 1.2.2) prompted several studies in
previously untreated patients with mild idiopathic
parkinsonism (table ii) to investigate whether selegiline alone could indeed reduce the rate of disease progression (see also section 1.2). the largest
and most rigorously controlled of these trials (parkinson study group j989a,b) also studied the possible contribution of tocopherol, since this agent
scavenges free radicals and may delay the development of parkinsonian symptoms (fahn 1988;
golbe et al. 1988b). changes in motor function and
a level of disability necessitating levodopa therapy
were used as trial end-points.
in all but 1 of the studies functional ability continued to deteriorate during selegiline therapy (table
ii). nevertheless, at any given time point the degree of functional impairment and disease severity
was less in selegiline-treated patients, compared
with placebo or tocopherol recipients (fig. 4). new
symptoms and/or worsening of existing disability
occurred after a mean of 10.8 months (range 2 to
23) of selegiline treatment in 17 of 22 (77%) patients
(elizan et al. 1989b). ten months later, after 23
months' selegiline therapy, disability had increased
in 3 more patients. csanda and tarczy (1987) reported a mean 10% improvement in ability after 6
months' therapy, but this was only half of the level
of improvement seen at 3 months. furthermore,
10 patients showing a slight improvement after 3
months subsequently deteriorated and another 10
derived no benefit from selegiline. these 20 patients
required additionallevodopa, amantadine or anticholinergic agents. the number of selegiline recipients requiring supplem~ntary levodopa after 12
months' therapy in 2 studies was 12 of 27 (44%)
and 97 of375 (26%), compared with 14 of25 (56%)
and 176 of 377 (47%) ofthose who did not receive
selegiline (myllyla et al. 1989; parkinson study
group 1989a; table ii). similarly, 6 of 22 patients
(27%) required levodopa supplementation after a
mean of 13 months (range 3 to 23 months) of selegiline treatment, but this number increased to 15
(68%) after 23 months with supplementation judged
to be imminent in another 5 (elizan et al. 1989b).

required before ]evodopa was initiated in 4 of 27
(15%) selegiline and 10 of 25 (40%) placebo recipients (myllyla et al. 1989). selegiline appears to delay the need for levodopa in the early stages of parkinson's disease by between 6 and 11 months.
levodopa was required after a mean or median of
545 to 549 days' selegiline monotherapy, significantly longer than the 312 to 372 days of placebo
administration (myllyla et al. 1990; tetrud &
langston 1989). these results are consistent with
the projected end-points of 26 and 15 months, respectively, in 375 and 377 patients given selegiline
or placebo (with or without tocopherol) reported
by the parkinson study group (1989a) [fig. 5]. a
defined difference in efficacy (p < 0.001) was
achieved only in patients receiving selegiline with

or without tocopherol 2000 u/day, ana nol m those
receiving placebo in place of selegiline (parkinson
study group 1989a). this ongoing study should
reveal whether there is a treatment effect due to
tocopherol, and help to resolve the relative contribution of symptomatic versus protective effects
of selegiline.
a delay in the development of motor disability
is therefore apparent in patients with mild parkinson's disease receiving selegiline 10 mg/day. however, it is not clear if this effect is a result of protection against nigrostriatal insults (see section 1.2)
or merely a symptomatic effect, a subject which
has attracted controversy (friedhoff 1990; langston 1990; saint-hilaire et ai. 1990; sterling 1'990;

fig. 4. rate of parkinson's disease progression in patients
receiving selegiline 10 mg/day (n = 22) or placebo (n = 22)
for 3 years, as measured by increases in scores rating disease
severity (after tetrud & langston 1989): updrs = unified
parkinson's disease rating scale; adl = activities of daily
living; ns = not statistically significant.

observations tend to suggest that the apparent
slowing of disease progression with selegiline is not
a manifestation of its ability to alleviate symptoms
as a consequence of enhanced dopaminergic activity. selegiline monotherapy resulted in little improvement (csanda & tarczy 1987) if any (elizan
et al. 1989b; teravainen 1990) in the signs and
symptoms of parkinson's disease. moreover,
symptom rating scores were not significantly different from baseline after 1 month's treatment with
selegiline, and did not deteriorate 1 month after
selegiline was stopped (tetrud & langston 1989).
however, inhibition of mao-b which leads-to increased brain levels of dopamine is irreversible with
selegiline and may take several days to recover
(section 1.1), thus perhaps leading to a persistence
of clinical benefit after selegiline is withdrawn
(goldstein et al. 1990; shoulson et al. 1990). however, it is still unclear if selegiline alone increases
dopamine levels in the brain (langston 1990).

3. tolerability
3.1 'cheese' effect
amines of dietary origin, such as tyramine in

cheese, are normally metabolised by mao-a in the
gut and liver. this is blocked by nonspecific inhibition of mao, thus potentiating the indirect
pressor effects of these amines, sometimes to a lethal degree (marley & blackwell 1970).
in 4 healthy volunteers and 6 patients with parkinson's disease, .7 months' daily administration of
selegiline 10mg had. no significant effect on the oral
dosage of tyramine needed to elicit a pressor response (elsworth et al. 1978). the effective doses
of tyramine were on average about 250mg (range
150 to 400mg), far in excess of normal dietary intake (100g of cheese contains about 100mg tyramine) [prasad et al. 1988]. other studies involving
volunteers and depressed patients indicated that the
standard anti parkinsonian dosage of selegiline 10
mg/day increased the sensitivity to tyramine between 1.5- and 4-fold (pickar et al. 1981; prasad et
al. 1988; schulz et al. 1989; sunderland et al. 1985),
a clinically insignificant level which would not necessitate modification of diet. tyramine restriction
is however prudent in depressed patients receiving
a higher dosage (30 mg/day) of selegiline (prasad
et al. 1988). results from clinical trials are consistent with these observations, with no significant
differences in blood pressure and an absence of the
'cheese' effect in patients taking levodopa with
either selegiline 10 mg/day or placebo (birkmayer
et al. 1977; golbe 1989; heinonen et al. 1989a; lees
et al. 1977; presthus & hajba 1983; sivertsen et al.
1989). a slightly higher systolic blood pressure and
heart rate, however, occurred in 27 patients receiving selegiline iomg alone daily (myllyla et al.
1989) and a hypertensive episode necessitating
withdrawal of selegiline has been reported in 1
patient receiving concurrent levodopa (giovannini
et al. 1986). furthermore, headache, which often
accompanies a tyramine-induced hypertensive crisis, occurs in between 2.5 to 26% of patients during
selegiline therapy but this incidence is similar to
that during placebo administration with or without
levodopa (eisler et al. 1981; giovannini et al. 1986;
golbe et al. 1988a; parkinson study group 1989a;
tetrud & langston 1989).
orthostatic hypotension, which is known with
nonselective mao inhibition, was evident in sev-

the regimen (golbe et al. 1988a; sivertsen et al.

hajba 1983; rinne 1983; teychenne & parker
1989). dyskinetic symptoms resolved when levodopa dosage was reduced (golbe et al. 1988a).

10- 10 between groups) [from parkinson study group 1989a].

eral isolated patients receiving selegiline and levodopa (birkmayer et al. 1977; giovannini et al.
1986; heinonen et al. 1989a; lees et al. 1977; presthus & hajba 1983), occasionally requiring selegiline withdrawal (waters 1990). two patients experienced syncope during selegiline administration
(golbe et al. 1988a; lees et al. 1977), and 32 of
800 patients (4%) felt dizzy, irrespective of whether
they received selegiline alone or placebo (parkinson study group 1989a).
3.2 dyskinesias
supplemental selegiline 10 mg/day caused dyskinesias in an average of 28% (range 4 to 90%) of
patients receiving levodopa (e.g. birkmayer et al.
1977; brodersen et al. 1985; giovannini et al. 1986;
golbe et al. 1988a; lees et al. 1977; rinne 1983;
sivertsen et al. 1989). the effect usually occurred
within the first 2 weeks after adding selegiline to

when used together selegiline and levodopa have
been associated with mood elevation in 6 of 11
patients (54%) [eisler et al. 1981], insomnia in 10
to 32% (an incidence similar to that with levodopa
alone) [brodersen et al. 1985; heinonen et al. 1989a;
rinne 1983] and hallucinations and/or vivid
dreams in 2 to 9% (golbe et al. 1988a; heinonen
et al. 1989a; lees et al. 1977; rinne 1983). about
5 to .10% of patients experienced mental confusion
during coadministration of selegiline and levodopa
(birkmayer et al. 1975; golbe et al. 1988a; heinonen et al. 1989a; rinne 1983).
these effects are probably caused by increased
dopaminergic activity in the presence of selegiline,
rather than by l-isomer amphetamine metabolites
of selegiline (see sections 1.3 and 1.4.3). indeed,
hallucinations were not noted during selegiline 10
mg/day monotherapy, and there was no significant
effect on well-being at this dosage, evaluated using
the hamilton depression scale (parkinson study
group 1989a; tetrud & langston 1989). 14 of 27
selegiline recipients (52%) in the latter study, however, reported insomnia [vs 4 (15%) placebo recipients] and 1 noted euphoria, so a possible contribution from the  xxxd163xxx  metabolites cannot
be entirely discounted.
excessive sweating has also occurred in between
4 and 16% of patients taking selegiline with levodopa (brodersen et al. 1985; eisler et al. 1981;
giovannini et al. 1986).
finally, transient and mild nausea, vomiting or
gastrointestinal pain was reported by approximately 12% of patients (range 3 to 22%) [e.g. birk-

mayer et al. 1977; giovannini et al. 1986; golbe
et al. 1988a; lees et al. 1977; tetrud & langston
1989]. exacerbation of pre-existing peptic ulcer,
with bleeding, has occurred (elizan et al. 1991).
3.4 effect on liver function
levels of 1 or more liver enzymes increased
transiently in 6 of 15 patients receiving selegiline
iomg daily for between 19 and 27 months, and
remained elevated in another 3 (golbe 1989). aspartate amino transferase (ast) significantly increased by a mean of 133% in 4 patients, alanine
aminotransferase (alt) by 155% in 3 patients and
alkaline phosphatase by 116% in 2 others. elevations were noticeable within 3 weeks in 4 patients,
and became significant after treatment for between
6 and more than 18 months. ast was also slightly
increased in 1 of 20 selegiline and 1 of 18 placebo
recipients, and alt in 2 and 1 patients, respectively, in the study of presthus and hajba (1983),
and alt was transiently above 100 u /l in 4 of
399 selegiline monotherapy recipients (1%) in the
study of the parkinson study group (1989a). although these effects on hepatic function were not
thought to be clinically significant and other medications may have been implicated, annual monitoring of liver enzymes has been advised (golbe
1989).

4. drug interactions
at the recommended oral dosage of 10 mg/day
in patients with parkinson's disease, selegiline does
not normally inhibit mao-a to a clinically relevant degree and thus, at this dosage, there do not
appear to be any contraindications to common
over-the-counter cold remedies containing sympathomimetic amines such as ephedrine (see also
section 3.1). it must be emphasised to patients,
however, not to increase the daily dosage of selegiline above iomg.
delirium, stupor, agitation and muscular rigidity occurred in a 56-year-old recipient of selegiline 5mg twice daily given pethidine (meperidine)
325mg over 3 days for postoperative analgesia

(zornberg et al. 1991). symptoms resolved 4 to 5
days after both drugs were discontinued. because
of this and other sometimes fatal interactions between nonselective maois and pethidine, the concurrent use of this and possibly other opioid analgesics with selegiline is contraindicated (data on file,
somerset pharmaceuticals).
concomitant tise. of selegiline and the antidepressant fluoxetine should also be avoided, since
mania, chills, diaphoresis and hypertension have
been reported in 2 patients with parkinson's disease receiving both drugs (suchowersky & devries
1990), and nonselective maois interact with
fluoxetine to produce a 'serotonin syndrome'
(feighner et al. 1990; sternbach 1988). because of
the slow elimination of :ouoxetine, an interval of
at least 2 and maybe up to 5 weeks is required
between stopping fluoxetine and starting selegiline
therapy (package insert, somerset pharmaceuticals).

5. dosage and administration
the recommended oral dosage of selegiline in
patients with parkinson's disease is 5mg twice daily,
once with breakfast and once at midday to avoid
possible insomnia, dizziness and nausea (section
3.3). the daily dosage of iomg should not be exceeded without restriction of tyramine-containing
foods or common cold remedies due to the possibility of the 'cheese' reaction from nonspecific
mao inhibition (section 3.1). this dosage may be
used as monotherapy in early disease or in conjunction with levodopa plus a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor. a reduction in levodopa dosage
of about 10 to 30% can be achieved without compromising symptom control, and indeed may be
necessary to avoid peak concentration dyskinesias,
hallucinations and confusion resulting from excess
nigrostriatal dopaminergic activity.

6. place 0/ selegiline in the therapy 0/
parkinson's disease
treatment of parkinson's disease has thus far
focused on restoring the deficiency in dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway, either by

selegiline: a review

administering dopamine precursors or agonists or,
less commonly, anticholinergic agents (quinn
1984). anticholinergic drugs, such as orphenadrine
hydrochloride and trihexyphenidyl (benzhexol),
should be used with caution in the elderly because
they can precipitate or accentuate glaucoma, urinary retention, constipation and cognitive impairment (marsden 1990; nutt 1990). levodopa is
the mainstay of treatment, in combination with a
peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor such as carbidopa or benserazide to prevent extracerebral metabolism of the drug to dopamine.
concomitant use of selegiline 10 mgfday and
levodopa therapy in parkinson's disease has been
extensively studied. because it enhances the effects
of dopamine in the nigrostriatal pathway by inhibiting mao-b and reducing presynaptic dopamine
reuptake, the primary role of adjunctive selegiline
is to minimise fluctuations in the response to levodopa which cannot be ameliorated through
modification of the levodopa regimen with controlled release formulations, using larger doses or
using more frequent, smaller doses (lees 1989;
marsden 1990). concomitant treatment with the
dopamine agonists bromocriptine, pergolide and
 xxxd2498xxx  can also reduce the incidence and severity
of 'on/off' and 'wearing-off' phenomena (langtry
& clissold 1990; marsden 1990). selegiline has
greater clinical benefit in patients with 'wearingoff' effects and has little effect on 'on/off' oscillations. the levodopa dosage can usually be de·
creased by 10 to 30% and disability improved, although these effects are often modest and rarely
last over a year (see section 2.1). peak concentration dyskinesias, hallucinations and confusion due
to levodopa may also be exacerbated by selegilineinduced potentiation of dopaminergic function,
suggesting caution is necessary in some elderly demented patients or those with advanced disease
(golbe et al. 1990).
encouraging results have recently been obtained
with selegiline monotherapy in patients with early
and/or mild idiopathic parkinsonian symptoms.
this is an exciting concept since most patients present with only mild motor deficit (tetrud & langston 1987). therefore, early use of selegiline at the

245

preclinical or mild disease stage may slow functional deterioration for many patients and prolong
the patient's productive life (marsden 1990; tetrud
& langston 1987). selegiline delays the onset of
symptoms severe enough to warrant levodopa
therapy by 6 months to a year, and- may also prolong life expectancy (section 2.2). it is debatable
whether this extra functional time is a consequence
of protection against further nigrostriatal degeneration (section 1.2), or merely reflects improvement in symptoms. comparative trials between selegiline and levodopa in early disease are needed
to shed more light on this question, but it will not
be fully resolved until methods are available which
allow the rate of neuronal destruction in living tissue to be determined (langston 1990; tetrud &
langston 1989, 1990). irrespective of the mechanism(s) involved, selegiline monotherapy appears
to have a place in the early treatment of patients
with parkinson's disease. clinical symptoms only
become noticeable when nigrostriatal dopaminergic activity has been reduced by 70 or 80%, when
over half of the nigral neurons are destroyed. (lewin
1985b; marsden 1990; pearce 1990; sonsalla &
golbe 1988). what is important now is to devise
methods which permit early diagnosis of, or evaluation of the risk of developing parkinson's disease, so that these beneficial effects of selegiline can
be fully utilised.
in summary, adjunctive selegiline therapy
should be considered in patients with moderate
parkinson's disease and end-of-dose fluctuations to
levodopa treatment. perhaps more importantly, selegiline administration to patients with newly diagnosed disease appears justified to delay the progression of more severe symptoms and the need
for symptomatic therapy. indeed, based on the
substantial evidence discussed above routine selegiline use in these patients has been advocated in
some quarters (marsden 1990; pearce 1990; sandler 1986).
