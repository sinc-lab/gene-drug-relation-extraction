be formed between two different retinoid receptor molecules but also between retinoid x
receptors and the  xxxg2412xxx  as well
as the triiodothyronin receptor. this fact indicates complex interactions between retinoids and further hormonal signal transduction molecules. interaction of retinoid receptors with transcriptional factors activated by
other signal transduction mechanisms, e.g.
ap-1, may provide dissociation of the retinoid effects. retinoids can exhibit agonistic
activity but also be neutral antagonists and

introduction

the pleiotropic effects of retinoids [1–4]
and the relatively selective targeting of certain
skin structures by different retinoid molecules
led to a continuous widening of the therapeutic spectrum of this compound class in dermatology since its introduction in the early
1980s. the identification of the retinoidbinding proteins in the 1980s and, especially,
of the nuclear retinoid receptors in the late
1980s to early 1990s offered the basis for a
better undestanding of the retinoid function
at the molecular level and led to the introduction of new retinoids for clinical use. on the
other hand, the unsuccessful efforts in limiting the teratogenic potential of systemic retinoids represent a major throwback.

pioneer development of synthetic
retinoids

the initial search for biologically more active and less toxic compounds led to the
chemical modification of all three portions of
the  xxxd3105xxx  molecule, the nonaromatic
ring, the polyprenoid chain and the carbonyl
end group [5]. it was found early that alterations of the polyprenoid chain may diminish
retinoid activity, whereas modifications of
the carbonyl end group are often associated
with reduced toxicity, while biologic activity
is maintained or even enhanced. substitutions for the ring was found to yield less toxicity with marked increase of the biologic activity of the molecule. in further developmental
work additional aromatic rings were introduced; some new retinoids barely remind the
original retinol molecule, such as the naphthalene carboxylic acid derivatives  xxxd77xxx 
and  xxxd3297xxx  [1]. today, retinoids are classified in three generations, regarding their
chemical structure: non-aromatic retinoids,
monoaromatic retinoids and polyaromatic
retinoids (arotinoids).
 xxxd3417xxx  (tretinoin) was the
first retinoid to be synthesized. although this
compound is now established for topical therapy (table 1), its systemic use did not reveal
significant advantages over retinol until recently when the drug showed beneficial effects
on acute  xxxg1785xxx  [6].
13-cis  xxxd3417xxx  (isotretinoin) is an extremely effective drug if given systemically in
severe forms of acne [7, 8]. it is the only retinoid with marked sebostatic activity after oral
intake; its topical use diminishes or cancels
out sebosuppression.
 xxxd2071xxx  achieved a breakthrough in the
treatment of severe psoriasis and other dermatoses; its widespread clinical use resulted
from the good ratio between therapeutic efficacy and adverse effects [9, 10]. the free acid

taneous t-cell lymphoma, aids-associated
kaposi’s sarcoma, acute  xxxg1785xxx  and actinic lentigines were currently
confirmed. in addition, retinoids have been
successfully used in several other dermatoses, e.g. epithelial precanceroses and tumors, seborrhea, rosacea and acneiform
dermatoses, lichen planus, eosinophilic folliculitis, condylomata accuminata, lichen
sclerosus and atrophicus. highly receptor selective molecules,  xxxd3417xxx  receptor-ßinducers, ap-1 complex antagonists, and inverse agonists will be probably lead the retinoid development in the near future. new,
more effective and less toxic retinoids, alone
or in combination with other drugs and new
delivery systems may provide therapeutic
solutions for benign and malignant proliferative skin diseases, such as psoriasis and nonmelanoma tumors, cancer chemoprevention
and differentiation therapy.

new concepts – new applications

the last decade is characterized by new
concepts of retinoid action which markedly
increased our knowledge on this substance
class and consolidated the strategies for identifying new retinoids for therapeutic use in
dermatology and other medical fields.

metabolite of  xxxd2071xxx ,  xxxd71xxx , was found
to be clinically as effective as  xxxd2071xxx  with a
much shorter elimination half-life, advantageous for clinical use. however, the fact that
re-esterification in vivo may converse  xxxd71xxx  into  xxxd2071xxx  cancelled out its major advantage when compared to its precursor. this
can be avoided when appropriate precautions
are taken.

retinoids are vitamins because retinol ( xxxd3105xxx ) is not synthesized in the body and
must be derived from diet. retinol and its
important derivatives, retinaldehyde and  xxxd3417xxx , are fat-soluble unsaturated isoprenoids necessary for growth, differentiation
and maintenance of epithelial tissues, and
also for reproduction. in a reversible process,
retinol is oxidized in vivo to give retinaldehyde, which is important for vision. retinoic
acid, the major oxidative metabolite of retinol, can substitute for retinol in vitamin adeficient animals in growth promotion and
epithelial differentiation. however, it cannot
substitute for retinol in completely maintaining reproduction. the stereoisomers all-trans
 xxxd3417xxx  and 13-cis  xxxd3417xxx  are both
normal constituents of human serum [11].
unlike the retinol esters which are stored in
the liver,  xxxd3417xxx  is rapidly excreted.
while endogenous metabolites of retinol are
unlikely to be involved in the pathogenesis of
skin diseases [12], hypervitaminosis a is associated with manifestations resembling the
mucocutaneous side effects of oral treatment
with synthetic retinoids.
on the other hand, retinoids are also hormones – with intracrine activity [13] – because retinol is transformed in the cells into
molecules that bind to nuclear receptors, exhibit their activity, and are subsequently inactivated. retinol is assumed to enter the cells
by non-receptor-mediated endocytosis [14].
intracellularly,  xxxd3417xxx  and 9-cis
 xxxd3417xxx , both natural metabolites of retinol, are transported by cytosolic proteins,
bind to specific nuclear receptors, induce expression of genes which bear specific dna
sequences recognizing the retinoid/receptor
complex [15], and are finally inactivated [16].
the intracrine concept implies an intracellu-

306

skin pharmacol appl skin physiol

lar control of the ligand amount availability to
nuclear receptors. because the intracellular
amount of the ligand required for exhibiting
normal activity is low, homeostasis is guaranted by the ability of the system to inactivate excessive retinoid amounts. molecules
shown to control the bioavailability of  xxxd3417xxx  are cytochrome p450 isoenzymes and
the  xxxg512xxx 
[17]. new synthetic retinoids may be planned
to target any step of this complex system.

receptor subtype selective
retinoids

retinoids exert their effects on target cells
by binding and activating the nuclear retinoid
receptors. retinoid receptors are members of
the steroid-thyroid hormone superfamily and
are classified into two families, the retinoic
acid receptors (rars) and the retinoid x
receptors (rxrs). they act as ligand-dependent transcriptional factors; e.g. rars can
bind both all-trans and 9-cis  xxxd3417xxx  with
high affinity, while rxrs selectively interact
with 9-cis  xxxd3417xxx . retinoid receptors
exist as ·, ß and á types, whereby each type
includes a number of isoforms. the retinoid
molecule/retinoid receptor complex activates
genes which possess specific short dna sequences in their promoter regions, known as
retinoid-responsive elements. the fact that
not all active retinoids combine biologic activity and affinity for and/or activation of the
receptors have led to suggestions for existence
of additional unknown retinoid signaling
pathways. 13-cis  xxxd3417xxx  shows low affinity for rars, 14-hydroxy-retro-retinol,
which specifically induces lymphocyte proliferation does not bind to or activate retinoid
receptors [18],  xxxd71xxx  does not bind to but
activates rars [19], and ro 40-1349 binds
but does not activate rars [20]. however,

topical retinoids

the knowledge that retinol and tazerotene activation requires their metabolism to the receptor-binding molecules  xxxd3417xxx  and tazarotenic acid, respectively [21], and especially, the recent elucidation of the mechanism of
13-cis  xxxd3417xxx  action on human sebocytes corroborated the significance of retinoid
receptors for biological retinoid activity. 13cis  xxxd3417xxx  is a prodrug, activated in
human sebocytes through a selective intracellular isomerization to high levels of all-trans
 xxxd3417xxx  and subsequent binding to rars
[22].
recently, rars and rxrs have been
identified to be encoded by distinct genes
which are even mapping on distinct chromosomes, namely 17q21.1 (rar·), 3p24
(rarß), 12q13 (rará), 9q34.3 (rxr·),
6p21.3 (rxrß) and 1q22–23 (rxrá) [1].
moreover, the expression of rars is tissuespecific [23]. therefore, ongoing retinoid research aims to synthesize substances, that se-

lectively bind the retinoid receptors to address specific targets [24, 25]. the current
introduction of compounds with selective
retinoid receptor agonistic activity underlines
the impressive development in this area of
medical treatment (table 1). the rarß/á selective retinoids  xxxd77xxx  and  xxxd3297xxx 
were approved for topical treatment of acne
[21, 26] as well as psoriasis ( xxxd3297xxx ) [21].
in addition, 9-cis  xxxd3417xxx  ( xxxd114xxx ), a
preferably rxr ligand, has currently been
approved for the topical treatment of aidsrelated kaposi’s sarcoma [27]. the latest approval was issued to  xxxd330xxx , a rxr selective agonist, for systemic and topical treatment of cutaneous t-cell lymphoma [28]. additional potent selective ligands are under
evaluation in preclinical and clinical studies
(table 2).

retinoid receptors bind retinoids in the
form of dimers, as homodimers (rxr/rxr)
or heterodimers (rar/rxr) [18]. heterodimers can be also formed between rxr and the
 xxxg2412xxx  (vdr/rxr) as well as
between rxr and the triiodothyronin receptor (t3r/rxr). this discovery has thrown
light on the complex interactions between
retinoids and further hormonal signal transduction molecules [1, 2]. following this concept, rxr selective retinoids may influence
vitamin d and  xxxg2285xxx 
genes, in addition to the rxr responsive ones.
on the other hand, vitamin d and thyroid hormone may also regulate rxr responsive genes.
clinically, combinations of rxr selective retinoids and vitamin d derivatives may potentiate the expected therapeutic result and decrease toxicity of each single compound [29].

dissociation of retinoid effects

current experimental studies have shown
that interaction of retinoid receptors with
transcriptional factors activated by other signal transduction mechanisms, e.g. ap-1 [30],
may produce specific retinoid effects. because
ap-1 is a key transcription factor in proliferative and inflammatory responses, its inhibition is likely to result in antiproliferative and
antiinflammatory effects. indeed, retinoids
with selective inhibition of ap-1 were shown
to reduce f9 teratocarcinoma cell proliferation without influencing cell differentiation
[31]. interestingly, rarß was currently found
to be responsible for ap-1 inhibition [32].
such selective anti-ap-1 synthetic retinoids,
among them such acting as rarß selective
ligands, are expected to have therapeutic applications in hyperproliferative/inflammatory

308

skin pharmacol appl skin physiol
2001;14:303–315

disorders such as psoriasis and certain skin
tumors. on the other hand, novel retinoid
mechanisms involve potent receptor-independent apoptosis-inducing activity, e.g.  xxxd2099xxx  or anhydroretinol [33].

retinoid receptor inverse agonists

the receptor-binding retinoids could be divided according to their function characteristics in three groups [25]: (a) agonists, the classical synthetic retinoids, which stimulate the
basal transcriptional activity of the retinoid
receptors; (b) neutral antagonists, which bind
the receptors without influencing their activity – they are, however, able to neutralize the
influence of both the agonists and the inverse
agonists; (c) inverse agonists, which bind the
receptors and restrain their basal transcriptional activity.
the last group of substances will include a
completely new group of retinoids which may
be administered in the topical treatment of
cutaneous diseases and also as an antidote for
the mucocutaneous adverse effects of systemic retinoids. such compounds may be interesting for the treatment of psoriasis because natural retinoids and cellular retinoic
acid-binding proteins are increased in psoriatic plaques [34, 35].

new indications – new retinoids

the updated indications of approved systemic and topical retinoids are shown in table 1. in addition, several skin diseases, reported in recent reviews, have been shown to
respond to retinoids [1–4, 6–10, 13, 36]. the
purpose of this part is to review major current
evolutions in the treatment of skin diseases
with retinoids and to predict possible future
indications and new compounds.

the ‘cross talk’ of nuclear
receptors

oral  xxxd71xxx  belongs nowadays to the
mainstream systemic antipsoriatic treatments, particularly in severe pustular and
erythrodermic types of the disease [9, 10, 19].
 xxxd71xxx  is usually administered in combination with other modalities (mild corticosteroids, dithranol, tar, vitamin d derivatives)
and/or with phototherapy. palmoplantar pustulosis, psoriasis of the nails, and hiv-associated psoriasis [37] significantly improve under systemic  xxxd71xxx  therapy. in pityriasis
rubra pilaris, a beneficial effect can be expected, especially in the juvenile type of the
disease [38]. isotretinoin treatment, mostly in
combination with puva, may be an effective
alternative to  xxxd71xxx  in fertile women in
whom prolonged administration of contraceptives is unacceptable [39].
the use of topical retinoids in the treatment of stationary, plaque-type psoriasis is a
current development [1–3].  xxxd3297xxx , a receptor-selective retinoid approved for topical
application, is an acetylenic retinoid (arotinoid) [21]. it is a poorly absorbed, non-isomerizable prodrug that is rapidly metabolized
to the active free carboxylic acid, tazarotenic
acid. the latter selectively binds to rarß 1
rará 11 rar·, without any affinity for
rxrs.  xxxd3297xxx  was found to normalize
acanthosis by inhibiting the proliferation of
psoriatic keratinocytes through several molecular mechanisms and also to decrease epidermal inflammation. clinical responses are seen
after 2 weeks with significant clearing after 6
to 12 weeks of treatment [40]. topically applied,  xxxd3297xxx  has a low potential for systemic adverse effects but it can be topically
strongly irritative. combination of  xxxd3297xxx 
with corticosteroids of low potency seems to
increase the overall therapeutic potential and
reduce local irritation [41].

retinoids and future indications

congenital disorders of
keratinization

systemic treatment with  xxxd71xxx  is effective in several disorders of keratinization
since its action in promoting keratinocyte differentiation is not specific for psoriasis [1, 2].
darier’s disease, ichthyosis vulgaris, congenital ichthyosis (particularly the dry lamellar
type), various types of palmoplantar keratoderma, and also erythrokeratodermia figurata
variabilis (mendes da costa) today represent
standard indications for oral  xxxd71xxx  treatment. clearing is not complete, but the overall improvement of skin appearance and function justifies its use. isotretinoin appears inferior to  xxxd71xxx  (10–20 mg/day) because it is
effective in high concentrations (1–2 mg/kg/
day) and its strong sebostatic action may dry
out the skin and cause physical discomfort. in
spite of that, isotretinoin was found very
effective and acceptable in lamellar ichthyosis, epidermolytic hyperkeratosis and darier’s
disease [8, 36]. treatment with local retinoids
is an effective alternative in mild forms of
these disorders and especially in darier’s disease [42–45].

acne

oral isotretinoin is the only drug currently
available that affects all four pathogenic factors for acne, directly suppressing abnormal
desquamation of sebaceous follicle epithelium and sebum production, and diminishing
growth of propionibacterium acnes and inflammation [7, 8]. according to a current recommendation of international experts, oral
isotretinoin should be prescribed not only to
patients with severe disease but also to patients with less severe disease and scarring
and/or significant acne-associated psychological stress [46]. an initial daily dose of 0.5 mg/

psoriasis and related disorders

skin cancer

cutaneous t-cell lymphoma ( xxxg2343xxx )
successful monotherapy of  xxxg2343xxx  has been
early reported with several retinoids [1, 2],
but it was  xxxd330xxx  ( xxxd330xxx ), a rxrselective retinoid, that was launched in the
usa in january 2000 for this indication [28].
the compound has been approved for oncedaily oral treatment of all stages of  xxxg2343xxx  in
patients refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy (table 1).  xxxd330xxx  gel was
approved in june 2000 for use as a treatment
of cutaneous lesions in patients with stage ia,
ib or iia  xxxg2343xxx . it was evaluated for the
treatment of patients with early stage  xxxg2343xxx 
(ia–iia) who were refractory to, intolerant to,
or reached a response plateau for at least 6
months on at least two prior therapies. efficacy results exceeded the protocol-defined response target rates; side effects were primarily
limited to local skin reactions.
the initial promising results of the interferon-alpha/ xxxd71xxx  combination in  xxxg2343xxx 
treatment could not be confirmed [1, 2]. the
interferon-alpha/ xxxd71xxx  combination was
with 38.1% complete remissions inferior
to the interferon-alpha/puva combination
with 70% complete remissions in a random-

ized study with 82 stage i and ii  xxxg2343xxx 
patients [48].
kaposi’s sarcoma
 xxxd114xxx  (9-cis  xxxd3417xxx ) is the first
rxr ligand been launched in the treatment
of a skin disease, namely as a adjuvant topical
regimen for aids-associated kaposi’s sarcoma [27]. in a randomized study with 268
patients, 35% treated with  xxxd114xxx  0.1%
gel had a positive response, compared with
18% treated with vehicle gel regardless of the
number of concurrent antiretroviral therapies. most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity, limited to the application
site. it is noticeable that systemic tretinoin
seems not to be superior to topical  xxxd114xxx . in a current open study with 20 hivseropositive men with cd4 cells 6200 !
106/l and low-risk kaposi’s sarcoma not previously treated with systemic anti-kaposi’s
sarcoma agents, tretinoin was given orally
(45 mg/m2 daily) for 12 weeks [49]. partial
response, stabilization and progression were
found in 42, 37, and 21% of the patients,
respectively. gradual flattening and lightening of lesions was observed in responders after
at least 2 months of treatment.
epithelial tumors
the exact mechanisms by which retinoids
act beneficially in precancerous skin conditions and prevent epithelial skin cancer is still
largely unknown, but current data suggest that
rar-related antiproliferative and proapoptotic signals may be involved [50]. inhibition of the ap-1 complex and/or suppression
of cox-2 expression and pge(2) biosynthesis may be involved in reduction of cell proliferation [31, 51], whereas induction of apoptosis probably results in an increase of intracellular ceramide levels [52].
the successful administration of synthetic
retinoids in several randomized chemopre-

kg, a cumulative dose of over 120 mg/kg, and
a treatment duration of at least 12 months (in
severe cases) [7] are advisable.
topical retinoids alone or in combinations
are regarded today as first-line treatment for
both comedogenic and mild inflammatory
acne. tretinoin, isotretinoin,  xxxd77xxx  and
 xxxd3297xxx  are effective comedolytic agents,
while  xxxd77xxx  is less irritative than tretinoin [26]. in inflammatory acne, the concomitant use of a topical retinoid with benzoyl
peroxide or an antibiotic can enhance the beneficial effect [47].

skin photoaging and disorders of
pigmentation

well-controlled studies attest to the efficacy of topical tretinoin in improving the features of photoaging [3, 59]. isotretinoin and
 xxxd3297xxx  were also found to improve photoaging skin changes [60, 61]. epidermal
melasma, actinic lentigines and superficial
postinflammatory hyperpigmentation also
respond to topical tretinoin, either alone or
in combination with hydroquinone and hy-

retinoids and future indications

drocortisone, in conjunction with a broadspectrum sunscreen [3]. topical tretinoin has
also been shown to improve aging features of
sun unexposed skin. new concepts are those
of topical retinoids been used for prevention
of photoaging [46] and of a combination
treatment of topical retinoids with 4-hydroxyanisole (mequinol), a tyrosinase inhibitor,
to significantly increase the depigmenting retinoid effect on actinic lentigines [62] (table 1).

retinoids in cosmetics

 xxxd3105xxx , one of the major retinyl
esters, is mostly used in cosmetics at concentrations of 0.5–0.6% in lotion, because of its
stability. interestingly, retinaldehyde and retinol may act on the epidermis in a similar
manner to tretinoin (0.025%) but induce significantly less irritation [63].

seborrhea, rosacea, and acneiform
dermatoses

the efficacy of low-dose oral isotretinoin
in seborrhea and severe or recalcitrant rosacea (10 mg/day) has been well documented [1,
2]. oral  xxxd114xxx  was shown to be significantly less effective than isotretinoin in reducing seborrhea [64]; oral tretinoin was found
ineffective [65]. interestingly, topical tretinoin (0.025% cream at night) also reduces
rosacea papules to 43% and erythema to 73%
of baseline [66].

miscellaneous disorders

currently, retinoids have been successfully
used in several dermatoses in addition to the
ones previously reported [1–4]; however, only

vention trials suggests that topical or oral retinoids have a significant effect in reversing premalignant skin lesions and maintaining normal differentiation [1, 6, 8, 53] (table 2). especially, isotretinoin as monotherapy (0.4 mg/kg/
day) or in combination with interferon-alpha
significantly decreases the incidence of second
primary tumors in patients with head-andneck cancer and reduces appearance of nonmelanoma skin cancer in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum and basal cell nevus syndrome [1, 2]. oral isotretinoin is also able to
prevent the development of new tumors in
muir-torre syndrome [8, 36]. high-dose  xxxd2071xxx  (4 mg/kg/day, 5 days/week) in combination with interferon-alpha and (6 mio i.u. s.c.,
5 days/week) was currently found to be moderately effective [54]. low-dose  xxxd71xxx  could
prevent premalignant and malignant lesions in
renal transplant recipients [55, 56]. a combination of topical tretinoin and low-dose  xxxd2071xxx  (10 mg/day) has been proposed for chemoprophylaxis and for reducing the adverse effects of the oral medication [57]. in spite of the
similar therapeutic spectrum of  xxxd71xxx  and
 xxxd2071xxx  ( xxxd71xxx  is the pharmacologically
active metabolite of  xxxd2071xxx ),  xxxd2071xxx  has
been reported to succeed in cases where  xxxd71xxx  fails [58], and may, therefore, experience a
renaissance.

a few controlled studies exist which confirm
the effectiveness of the compounds [36].
topical tretinoin was found effective on
actinic keratoses [67], plane warts [68] and
early erythematous stretch marks [69], and
was suggested to accelerate the speed of healing when applied before cosmetic operative
procedures [70].
in addition to oral  xxxd71xxx  [71], low-dose
oral tretinoin (10–30 mg/day) was found effective in both oral and skin lesions of lichen
planus [72].
oral isotretinoin was effective in patients
with generalized granuloma annulare [73],
and eosinophilic pustular folliculitis as well as
hiv-associated eosinophilic folliculitis [74,
75]. in combination with interferon-alpha
higher remission rates and shorter duration of
treatment was achieved in condylomata accuminata than with isotretinoin alone [76]. topical isotretinoin was effective in actinic keratoses of the face [77].
oral  xxxd71xxx  (20–30 mg/day) was an effective treatment (64 versus 25% of the placebo)
of severe lichen sclerosus and atrophicus of
the vulva [78].
chronic hand eczema presented a good to
very good response in 89% of 38 patients
treated with oral  xxxd114xxx  [79].

refractory sclerodermatous chronic graftversus-host disease of long duration presented
74% response to oral  xxxd2071xxx  3 months after
initiation of therapy. improvement included
softening of the skin, flattening of cutaneous
lesions, increased range of motion, and improved performance status [80].

conclusion

highly receptor-selective molecules, rarß
inducers, ap-1 complex antagonists, and inverse agonists will probably be the retinoid
subclasses that will be developed in the near
future. new, more effective and less toxic retinoids, alone or in combination with other
drugs may provide therapeutic solutions for
benign and malignant proliferative skin diseases, such as psoriasis and non-melanoma
tumors. additional work will probably focus
on cancer chemoprevention and differentiation therapy [49, 81]. at last, new systems
may facilitate delivery of the compounds to
the target issues and/or simplify the dosage
scheme [82, 83].
