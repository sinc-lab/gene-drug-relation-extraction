abstract
inhibitors of  xxxg682xxx  (egfr) signaling are
among the novel drugs showing great promise for cancer treatment in the
clinic. however, the possibility of acquired resistance to such drugs because of tumor cell genetic instabilities has not yet been explored. here we
report the experimental derivation and properties of such cell variants
obtained from recurrent tumor xenografts of the human a431 squamous
cell carcinoma, after two consecutive cycles of therapy with one of three
different anti-egfr monoclonal antibodies: mr3,  xxxd2729xxx , or  xxxd467xxx . initial
response to a 2-week period of treatment was generally total tumor
regression and was not significantly different among the three antibody
groups. however, tumors often reappeared at the site of inoculation,
generally after prolonged latency periods, and most of the tumors became
refractory to a second round of therapy. cell lines established from such
resistant tumors retained high egfr expression, normal sensitivity to
anti-egfr antibody or ligand, and unaltered growth rate when compared
with the parental line in vitro. in contrast, the a431 cell variants exhibited
an accelerated growth rate and a significantly attenuated response to
anti-egfr antibodies in vivo relative to the parental line. because of the
reported suppressive effect of egfr inhibitors on vascular endothelial
growth factor (vegf) expression, and the demonstrated role of vegf in
the angiogenesis and growth of a431 tumor xenografts, relative vegf
expression was examined. five of six resistant variants expressed increased levels of vegf, which paralleled an increase in both angiogenic
potential in vitro and tumor angiogenesis in vivo. in addition, elevated
expression of vegf in variants of a431 cells obtained by gene transfection rendered the cells significantly resistant to anti-egfr antibodies in
vivo. taken together, the results suggest that, at least in the a431 system,
variants displaying acquired resistance to anti-egfr antibodies can
emerge in vivo and can do so, at least in part, by mechanisms involving the
selection of tumor cell subpopulations with increased angiogenic potential.

introduction
among the most successful of the new molecular-targeted drugs for
the treatment of cancer are the signal transduction inhibitors (1).
these drugs, in general, target specific molecular alterations that are
thought vital for such functions as cancer cell proliferation, survival,
and ability to induce angiogenesis. examples include humanized
mabs3 such as herceptin, directed against the overexpressed egfr

family member erbb2/her2/neu (2, 3); chimeric mabs such as  xxxd467xxx ;
or small molecule antagonists such as  xxxd2186xxx  (iressa) directed to the
egf ( xxxg682xxx ) receptor (2, 4), st1571, which is highly specific for the
bcr-abl kinase (5), and to ras farnesyltransferase inhibitors (6). some
of these drugs are already clinically approved, e.g., herceptin and
st1571, or have shown impressive effects in clinical trials, either on
their own or in combination with standard treatments such as radiation
or chemotherapy, e.g.,  xxxd467xxx  in several types of solid tumors (7).
indeed, a recurring theme of signal transduction inhibitors is the
ability of such drugs to function as effective radiation or chemosensitizers, thereby rendering tumor cells more vulnerable to the cytotoxic effects of standard therapies (8 –12). this may occur by various
mechanisms such as lowering the threshold for apoptosis or impairing
dna repair processes (12, 13).
a surprising feature of the preclinical research undertaken on
anticancer signal transduction therapy is the almost total lack of
information dealing with the issue of acquired resistance to such
drugs. this stands in conspicuous contrast to conventional therapeutics such as all classes of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs. because
genetic instabilities of cancer cells are a major driving force of
acquired drug resistance (14, 15), it would be expected that acquired
resistance would eventually develop to signal transduction inhibitors
that target exclusively a cancer cell-associated genetic or phenotypic
alteration. an example of this possibility is the emergence of variant
resistant cells to a ras farnesyltransferase inhibitor after prolonged
exposure of drug-sensitive tumor cells in vitro (16). another is the
development of resistance to st1571 in vivo in bcr-abl-positive
chronic myelogenous leukemia cells grown in nude mice, as a result
of the binding of ␣1 acid glycoprotein to the drug (17). similar studies
undertaken in an in vivo context with other signal transduction inhibitors, including those targeting egfr, are lacking. with this in mind,
we embarked on a long-term study to isolate and to begin characterizing tumor cell variants resistant to egfr-targeting drugs such as
monoclonal neutralizing abs. our approach was based on the observation that a small number of human tumor cell lines, e.g., the a431
squamous cell carcinoma or the 253j b-v bladder cell carcinoma,
when grown as established xenografts, can be induced to substantially
or even totally regress when treated with anti-egfr abs such as
 xxxd467xxx  (18, 19). we reasoned that if similarly treated tumors were then
followed for long periods, variants might eventually emerge, and if so,
such recurrent tumors could represent the outgrowth of the progeny of
rare variants no longer fully responsive to the egfr-targeting drug.
the rationale for undertaking such experiments was not only for the
obvious intrinsic value of deriving such variants but also as a means
of exploring in greater depth the hypothesis that egfr-targeting
agents function in vivo, at least in part, by blocking angiogenesis (19,
20). for example,  xxxd467xxx  treatment can block the production of several
proangiogenic growth factors in treated egfr-positive tumor cells,
including vegf,  xxxg562xxx , and  xxxg787xxx 
(19 –22). we hypothesized that this effect could contribute to its
therapeutic efficacy in vivo (20). if this assumption was correct,

resistance to egfr abs

resistant variants could arise in vivo by such mechanisms as increased
vegf production (23) or by activating one or more alternative
proangiogenic growth factors.
the present experiments were performed using three different
monoclonal anti-egfr abs and the a431 human tumor cell line. the
abs included an unmodified mouse mab (mr3), a humanized version
of this ab ( xxxd2729xxx ), and an independent, chimeric, ab ( xxxd467xxx ). we found
that variants could indeed arise, usually only after a protracted period
of time posttreatment, and not in all mice. all of the six independent
variants that we analyzed, with the exception of one, displayed increased vegf production. these in vivo selected variants should be
useful tools to investigate the role of the egfr in cancer growth and
angiogenesis, as well as for studies designed to improve the use of
anticancer drugs that target tumor cell-associated receptor tyrosine
kinases, particularly the egfr.

regressed, with only a few exceptions. mice were then maintained and monitored for tumor recurrences, which were first observed in a proportion of mice
in the 0.25-mg-dose-per-injection groups, 2 months after the beginning of
treatment (see “results” for details). as soon as the recurrent tumors reached
a size similar to that of the initially treated tumors (i.e., 200 – 600 mm3), a
second round of treatment was initiated using the same ab, dose, and schedule
initially applied to treat that tumor-bearing mouse (e.g., 0.25 mg of mr3 every
48 h for 2 weeks, if the recurrent tumor was in a mouse from the mr3
lower-dose treatment group). tumors that did not respond during the 1st week
of treatment with the 0.25-mg dose were then treated with 1 mg per injection
according to the same schedule (i.e., every 48 h) during the next 2 weeks or
less, depending on tumor response. tumors initially treated with a dose of 1
mg per injection were treated only with the same dose and schedule. tumors
that did not regress or remain dormant (as in the first round of treatment) after
the second treatment were considered resistant. the corresponding mouse was
then euthenized, and the tumor cells were recovered in vitro by enzymatic
treatment (29) under aseptic conditions and were grown in tissue culture. cells
were passaged in culture at least three times before any further testing.

resistance to egfr abs

vivo experiment. briefly, scid mice (five per group) bearing a431, r1, and
r5 s.c. tumor xenografts (average tumor volume, 250 mm3) were treated with
two injections of either pbs (control) or 200 ␮g of anti-hvegf ab 4201–
42-35 (novartis). tumors were recovered for immunohistochemical analysis
after 1 week (average tumor volume: 321 mm3, 452 mm3, and 423 mm3 for
a431, r1, and r5, respectively).
immunohistochemistry. vegf staining was performed on formalin-fixed
and paraffin-embedded specimens as described previously (20). blood vessels
were visualized by  xxxg1724xxx  staining, which was performed on 7-␮m-thick
cryosections using the rat antimouse  xxxg1724xxx  no 01951d (pharmingen) at a
concentration of 1 ␮g/ml 1:500. biotinylated rabbit anti-rat (jackson immunoresearch) and histostain kit (zymed laboratories, san francisco, ca)
reagents were used to reveal antigen as a red signal. contrast was provided

were analyzed by a one-way anova test coupled to a bonferroni test for
multiple comparisons. in vitro data were compared by a t test.

results
antitumor activity of  xxxd2729xxx  and  xxxd467xxx  mabs. one of the two main
aims of this study was to evaluate the possibility that the use of
egfr-blocking abs in vivo might result in a selection of drugresistant variants. we decided to explore this subject using at least two
different egfr-neutralizing abs,  xxxd467xxx  and  xxxd2729xxx , which possess similar binding affinities but different specificities (24, 26). we chose the
human squamous cell carcinoma a431 based on its extensive use as
a model over the past 15 years in the study of the efficacy of many
different antagonists of egfr, including  xxxd467xxx  (18, 31, 32). we have
previously found ( by using [3h]thymidine incorporation assays) that
the maximum growth inhibitory effect of either  xxxd467xxx  or  xxxd2729xxx  in vitro
is 40%. this was achieved on monolayer cultures after 48-h exposure
to doses ranging between 50 and 100 ␮g/ml.4 to investigate the
relative efficacy of the abs ( xxxd467xxx , mr3, and  xxxd2729xxx ) in vivo, we tested
their antitumor properties on a431 s.c. tumor xenografts, thus resembling the orthotopic location for this tumor, implanted into scid
mice. under such conditions, the three abs seemed equally efficient
in causing total regression of well-established tumors after 2 weeks of
treatment (eight injections) with a low- or a high-dose regimen (fig.
1), at least during the first 3 weeks of follow-up. no significant
difference was observed among the groups when compared by dose or
by ab type (p ⬎ 0.05 in all cases).
sporadic tumor recurrence after treatment with anti-egfr
abs. after the tumor regressions became evident in the first responders, treatment was terminated, and the mice were monitored for tumor
recurrence. the first such recurrences occurred 1.5 months after
termination of the first round of treatment in the 0.25-mg-dose-perinjection groups injected with mr3 or  xxxd2729xxx  (fig. 1, a and c). in each
of these groups, one tumor did not regress completely after the eight
injections, which perhaps suggests a low level of intrinsic resistance
to egfr inhibition. these tumors were the first to regrow (as expected) over a period as short as 18 days after the maximum antitumor
effect was achieved (fig. 1, a and c). in the 0.25-mg-dose-perinjection  xxxd467xxx  treatment group, one tumor recurrence was observed
after a latency period of 2 months (fig. 1e). recurrence of tumors in
the higher-dose groups took longer and was first evident after a
4.5-month latency period in the mr3-treatment group and after 1.5months in the  xxxd2729xxx -treatment group (fig. 1, b and d). recurrence also
took a long period to occur in the higher-dose  xxxd467xxx  group, e.g., after
3.5 months (fig. 1f). the frequencies of tumor recurrence for  xxxd467xxx ,

 xxxd2729xxx , and mr3, respectively, were 20, 40, and 80% for the 0.25-mgdose treatment groups and 25, 25, and 80% for the 1-mg-dose groups.
mice with recurrent tumors in all of the groups subsequently received
a second round of treatment (table 1).
a431 recurrent tumors escape a second round of antiegfr treatment: derivation of variants. while administering the
second round of treatment, we observed that in most cases the tumors
did not respond to the same extent as they did originally. tumors
regrew rapidly during, or immediately after, this cycle of therapy. cell
lines established from these tumors were designated as follows: r1
and r2 [two morphologically different subpopulations of a resistant
tumor from the mr3, 0.25-mg-dose group (fig. 1a)]; r3 and r4, from
two individual resistant tumors of the  xxxd2729xxx , 0.25-mg-dose group (fig.
1c); r5, recovered from a tumor in the  xxxd2729xxx , 1-mg-dose group (fig.
1d); and r6, which was recovered from a resistant tumor in the mr3,
1-mg-dose-group (fig. 1b). more detailed data on the derivation of
the resistant variants are summarized in table 1.
a common cellular origin for the a431 r variants was demonstrated using a dna fingerprinting analysis (fig. 2a). identical banding patterns suggest that all of the cell lines are a-431-derived and are
not comprised of contaminating human or mouse tumor cells. having
established this, two resistant variants (r1 and r5) were chosen for a
final in vivo resistance test based on a pilot screening. r1 and r5 were
both representative of the similar in vivo growth properties found in
the majority of the resistant cells. for the final test, 106 cells (a431,
r1, and r5) were inoculated s.c. into 6-week-old nude mice (five per
treatment group), and tumor growth was monitored every 4 days to
compare tumor take rates. treatment was initiated when tumors
reached an average size of 200 –300 mm3 and was administered as
described for the 0.25-mg/injection group. both r1 and r5 manifested an accelerated growth in vivo (fig. 2b), which became evident
18 days after tumor cell injection and which became significant by
day 22. the increased growth rate of these variants was even more
significant after a 30-day period of growth, as observed in an independent tumor-take experiment (data not shown). these in vivo results
stand in marked contrast to the in vitro data, in which similar growth
rates between the r variants and the a431p cells were observed
(table 2). when the variants were tested for their response to egfrblocking abs (e.g.,  xxxd467xxx ) in vivo, both r1 and r5 showed a similar
and significant delayed response. (fig. 2c). by day 45, all of the five
tumors included in the a431 group had totally regressed, whereas in
the r1 and r5 groups, only one and two such total regressions were
observed, respectively. maximum average responses for r tumors
were registered at day 45. the remaining r1 and r5 tumors did not
regress by day 86, at which point at least one of the tumors in each
group (r1 or r5) regrew to the maximum allowed size (1700 mm3)
according to the guidelines of the canadian council on animal care
(ccac), and the experiment was terminated. no sign of tumor was
seen by day 86 in any of the animals included in the a431 group
treated with  xxxd467xxx . similar results were obtained after  xxxd2729xxx  treatment
(data not shown).
absence of changes in egfr status in a431 variants resistant to egfr-blocking abs in vivo. as a second step in the characterization of the a431-resistant variants, we examined the level of
egfr expression, because resistance to treatment with egfr-blocking agents could have obviously resulted from loss or reduction in the
level of expression of the receptor itself. however, we did not detect
evidence to implicate such a mechanism, because five of six variants
showed levels of egfr similar to those expressed by a431 parental
cells (fig. 3a). to demonstrate that egfr was equally functional in
a431 and the variants, we stimulated the different cell lines with
increasing concentrations of tgf-␣ and measured the level of phospho-active egfr. activation of egfr was found to be equivalent

between a431 and all of the r variant cells, with the exception of r6,
which showed less phospho-active receptor (data not shown) in proportion to a lower amount of egfr expressed by these cells. only the
results obtained with r1 and r5 are shown (fig. 3a). the similar
pattern in expression level and ligand-induced activation of egfr
between a431 and the r variants suggests that major changes in the
egfr status are unlikely to be responsible for the resistant phenotype.

this conclusion is reinforced by the similar growth responses of a431
cells and the r variants to the inhibitory effects of  xxxd467xxx  (50 ␮g/ml)
and tgf-␣ (100 ng/ml) treatment in vitro (table 2). high concentrations of egfr-specific ligands, i.e., egf and tgf-␣, have been
reported to cause a potent growth inhibition of a431 cells, a phenomenon associated with their considerably elevated expression of egfr
(33, 34). the virtually identical pattern of growth inhibition of a431

and the r variants r1-r5 by tgf-␣ is consistent with their equivalent
levels of egfr expression. similarly, we did not find significant
changes in the levels of expression of her-2 (fig. 3a), the second
member of the egfr family also known to be involved in cell
transformation and tumor progression (35). her-2 has been shown to
heterodimerize with egfr, altering the patterns of downstream cellular signaling (36, 37). with the exception of r6, which appears to
express lower levels of her-2, none of the variants expressed levels
of her-2 that were significantly different from that of the parental
cells, which suggests that changes in her-2 expression are not a
common feature of the resistant variants. in agreement with the
decreased expression of egfr and her-2 found in r6, this cell line
showed an unusually slow growth rate (data not shown).
constitutive vegf up-regulation in anti-egfr-resistant
variants of a431. because of the clear discrepancy between the in
vitro findings (in which resistance was not seen) and in vivo findings
(in which resistance was detected), we considered the possibility that
the r variants possess increased survival properties under restricted
growth conditions or, alternatively, an increased angiogenic ability,
which could translate into both superior growth and prolonged survival in vivo. because neither  xxxd467xxx  nor  xxxd2729xxx  is able to induce cell
death of a431 cells under restricted culture conditions, e.g., threedimensional/low serum cultures,4 we could not compare differences in
survival in response to ab treatment under such conditions. an
alternative experiment, a clonogenic survival analysis, failed to show
a survival advantage in the resistant variants (table 2), which suggests
that an improved basal cellular survival is unlikely to explain the in
vivo growth advantage. to evaluate the possibility of enhanced proangiogenic capacity in the r variants, we measured the levels of the
proangiogenic factor vegf, at both the rna and protein levels in all
of the cell lines. the importance of this growth factor for tumor
angiogenesis has been established for a431 cells (38), and, furthermore, we have reported previously that the egfr-neutralizing ab
 xxxd467xxx  is able to down-regulate vegf protein up to 50% in vitro and
to an even greater extent in vivo in these cells (20), which we
hypothesized could account for the reduced vessel counts found in this
and other tumor models after treatment with egfr-blocking agents
(19, 20). we found that five of the six resistant variants, r6 being the
exception, expressed at least 2-fold more vegf mrna and protein
than the a431p cells (fig. 3, b and c). although vegf levels were
still down-regulated in vitro by 50% as a result of treatment with  xxxd467xxx 
(50 ␮g/ml), it should be noted that, even under such conditions,

variant cells still produce 2- to 4-fold more vegf than does a431
(fig. 3c). we discarded the possibility that the elevated vegf
expression was merely the result of in vivo passaging of a431 cells,
by comparing the expression of vegf with that in a431 parental cells
passaged in vivo for 14 days. these cells expressed levels of vegf
that were similar to those of the parental cells and also showed an
equivalent growth rate in vivo (data not shown). in addition, we also
observed an increase in the growth response of huvecs to the cm
of r variants 1 to 5 (fig. 3d), but not to that from variant r6 (data not
shown), suggesting an increased angiogenesis-inducing capacity in
the vegf-overexpressing cells. the absence of an increase in vegf
expression in addition to the reduced levels of egfr, her-2, and the
delayed growth rate found in r6 cells suggests that this variant
escaped the antitumor effect of anti-egfr ab treatment by a different
mechanism from that in the other variants.
in contrast to the results with vegf, no common pattern was
observed in the levels of  xxxg2278xxx  (fig. 3b), a naturally occurring
angiogenesis inhibitor previously shown to be down-regulated by
activation of ras, one of the downstream effectors of egfr (39).
whereas a431 cells appear to express very low amounts of  xxxg2278xxx ,
two variants, r2 and r5, exhibit a paradoxical increase in  xxxg2278xxx 
transcript levels. we have no explanation for this increased  xxxg2278xxx  and
its biological impact because it is obvious from the in vivo data that
increased  xxxg2278xxx  does not confer a growth disadvantage to r5
(fig. 2b).
in vivo resistance to egfr-neutralizing ab of a431 cell lines
engineered to overexpress vegf. because of the apparent increase in vegf in the resistant versus a431p cells, we decided to test
whether or not such increased vegf levels could account, at least in
part, for the resistant phenotype to egfr-blocking agents in vivo. we
reasoned that the resistance of these variants could result from the
inability of egfr-blocking abs to down-regulate vegf levels to
the same extent that they do in the parental cells. this would limit the
ability of these agents to achieve the same degree of antiangiogenic
effect as in the case of a431 parental tumors. consequently, an
endogenous egfr-independent increase in vegf expression could
act as a de facto resistance mechanism for egfr inhibitors. to test
this hypothesis, we decided to boost vegf production in a431
parental cells using a gene transfection procedure. an expression
vector was used that encoded the murine form of vegf164 (equivalent to human isoform  xxxg1608xxx ), a secretable form of vegf that
appears to be overexpressed in the r variants of a431 cells. after

resistance to egfr abs

fig. 2. phenotypic profile of egfr ab-resistant variants of a431. a, dna fingerprinting analysis showing identical banding pattern of resistant variants and parental a431
cells. b, growth of control tumors showing increased growth rate of r1 and r5 compared
with the parental cells. c, treatment of r1 and r5 tumor xenografts with  xxxd467xxx  in new
hosts results in growth inhibition, but this is significantly delayed compared with the
immediate antitumor response observed with the a431p tumors (see “results” section for
details). error bars, sd.

preliminary screening, three clones (mvegf.s1, mvegf.s2, and
mvegf.s3), expressing varying amounts of vegf ranging between
800 and 12,000 pg/ml, were selected for further analysis. the levels
of mvegf produced by these clones were completely refractory to
treatment with  xxxd467xxx  (fig. 4a). this was expected because the expression of exogenous mvegf164 is under the control of the constitutively active and strong cmv promoter. in addition, the clones were
found to maintain an intact in vitro response to  xxxd467xxx  in terms of
growth inhibition (data not shown) and expression of endogenous

hvegf (fig. 4a). we compared the in vivo responsiveness of vegfoverexpressing (mvegf.s) and a431p cells to the  xxxd467xxx  ab. as
previously found, a low-dose regimen was sufficient to cause total
tumor regression of well-established a431 parental and control (vector-transfected) tumors but was unable to do so in the case of the
vegf transfectants (fig. 4, b and c), which showed significant
(p ⬍ 0.05) resistance compared with the control groups. no significant difference was found (p ⬎ 0.05) among the three vegfoverexpressing clones, although a tendency of a direct correlation
between the level of vegf produced and the degree of resistance was
observed. in this regard, it is important to mention that the clone
expressing the lowest amount of exogenous vegf (mvegf.s1)
secretes an overall quantity of this protein that is in close similarity to
that secreted by some of the resistant variants themselves. the fact
that this clone still exhibits a significant resistance to egfr-blocking
treatment in vivo reinforces the idea of an involvement of vegf in the
resistance mechanism.
histopathological analysis of 3-week-old s.c. tumors of parental
and mvegf164-transfected a431 cells revealed no differences in
cellular morphology but did reveal a slightly larger central area of
necrosis in the mvegf164 tumors, probably reflecting their more
accelerated growth rate. in addition, tumors derived from clones s2
and s3 exhibited focal areas of hemorrhage that were particularly
large in the s2 tumors (data not shown), which suggests that the
extremely nonphysiological amount of vegf164 produced by this
clone could be responsible for this characteristic. staining of blood
vessels with the endothelial-specific marker  xxxg1724xxx  did not show an
increase in the microvessel density of mvegf-overexpressing tumors
but showed a striking difference in the size of the vascular channels
found in mvegf164 transfectants compared with those found in a431
parental tumors (fig. 5). vessels in mvegf-expressing tumors were
highly enlarged, consisting in many cases of a complex structures
suggestive of splitting of the vessel lumen by endothelial intravessel
walls (fig. 5, b and c). the overall appearance of these vessels seem
to resemble that found in the previously described “mother vessels”
(40), which result from increased mvegf164-dependent angiogenesis. the functionality and impact of these enlarged vessels on tumor
biology is still unclear. however, in the context of the s.c. a431
model, these vessels appear to be a hallmark of vegf164-dependent
angiogenesis, which did not result, in this case, in an increase in
microvessel density. this altered angiogenesis could account for the
reduced response of a431 tumors to egfr-blocking abs, such as
 xxxd467xxx  (fig. 4, b and c). the general appearance of tumor tissue from
mvegf164-transfectant and parental tumors after  xxxd467xxx  treatment
would appear to support this hypothesis. a431 tumors appear almost
totally necrotic, with only a rim of viable tissue in the periphery (fig.
5e), which virtually lacks blood vessels (fig. 5f). in contrast, c225treated mvegf164 transfectant tumors are comprised of a mixture of

resistance to egfr abs

fig. 3. absence of significant changes in egfr receptor status and increased vegf expression in resistant variants of a431. a, expression of egfr, her-2 and ligand-induced
activation of egfr as determined by western blots. no significant quantitative differences were detected in the egfrs expressed by the a431 r variants compared with the a431p
cells, with the exception of r6, which showed reduced levels of both egfr and her-2. in addition, a431p and r variants respond similarly to increasing concentrations of tgf-␣.
the results shown are those obtained with r1 and r5, which are representative of all of the variants, except for r6 (see “results” for details). ␤-actin is shown as loading control.
b, levels of vegf and  xxxg2278xxx  rna expressed by variants r1 to r5, and a431p cells. all of the variant cells, with the exception of r6 (data not shown), express at least 2-fold more
vegf mrna than parental cells.  xxxd467xxx  treatment down-regulates vegf in all of the cell lines. no trend is observed in the levels of  xxxg2278xxx  mrna in the r variants. rrna (bottom
panel) was used as loading control. c, increased production of vegf protein in the a431 r variants as determined by elisa. the results are consistent with the northern blot analysis,
showing a 2- to 3-fold increase in vegf protein in the r variants compared with a431. d, response of huvecs to the cm produced by either a431 or r cells. an increase in thymidine
incorporation is seen only with the cm from vegf-overexpressing cells. vegf (50 ng/ml) was used as a positive control. the results are the average of quadruplicate measurements
and are standardized to cell number at the time of cm collection. error bars, sd.

necrotic and viable tissue (fig. 5g), with highly enlarged vascular
channels supporting the growth of tumor cell “cuffs” (fig. 5h). taken
together, the results suggest that increased vegf expression, which is
refractory to the effects of  xxxd467xxx , could be responsible, at least in part,
for the resistance of the variant a431 tumors to egfr-blocking abs.
evidence of a causal role of vegf in the altered vascularity
of a431 variants. to determine whether the elevated vegf expression of the resistant variants could result in an altered vegf-dependent angiogenesis phenotype, we analyzed tumor sections obtained
from a short in vivo experiment, in which mice bearing a431, r1, and
r5 tumors were treated with either pbs (control) or anti-hvegf ab
for 1 week, after which a moderate antitumor effect was observed in
each group (treated:control ratio: 0.66, 0.61, and 0.81 for a431, r1,
and r5, respectively; see “materials and methods” for details). both
vegf expression and vascularity were evaluated by immunostaining.
we observed that in both a431p and r tumor sections, vegf staining
was mostly localized at the tumor periphery. in the a431 tumors,
vegf expression was usually seen in large patches or “islands” (fig.
6a) composed mainly of large cells with a moderately- to welldifferentiated squamous morphology. slightly smaller cells with
higher nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio surrounding these islands were negative for vegf staining (fig. 6a). in contrast, vegf staining in the
r1 and r5 variants was more diffuse and present in almost all of the

viable cells, which showed a relatively high nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio
and a moderately differentiated morphology (fig. 6, d and g). staining for  xxxg1724xxx  showed no obvious increase in the vessel density of r1
and r5 tumors compared with those of a431p cells. instead, the size
of the vessels appeared significantly larger in the r variant tumors
(fig. 6, b, e, and h). a majority of blood vessels in the r1 tumors
were more than 2-fold larger than those detected in a431, whereas r5
tumors appeared to possess even more expanded and complex vascular channels, consisting in some cases of several compartments (fig.
6h) resembling those found in mvegf164 a431 transfectants (fig.
5). these large vessels (40) in the r variant tumors appeared to be
vegf-dependent, because they became less common or smaller after
1 week of treatment with the anti-hvegf ab 4301-42-35 (ref. 27;
fig. 6, f and i). in contrast, the same treatment caused a reduction in
the microvascular density in a431 p tumors (fig. 6, c versus b) but
no apparent change in vessel size.

surprising fact that no preclinical studies have been undertaken to
evaluate whether, and how, acquired resistance to such drugs may
develop. our results show that acquired resistance can indeed develop
in vivo to egfr blocking abs. however, it is encouraging that the
efficiency with which such resistance develops appears to be rather
modest. first, in our study, recurrent tumors did not develop in all of
the mice, and when they did occur, it was usually after prolonged
latency periods. indeed, it was only as a result of undertaking such

long-term-observation experiments that we detected the emergence of
resistant variants. second, it should be noted that the only possible
target of the abs in our model was the egfr expressed by the
implanted, genetically unstable human a431 tumor cells growing in
the scid mice. in contrast, in the clinical situation, such abs would
have the potential opportunity to block egfrs expressed by normal
(genetically stable) host endothelial cells of newly formed tumor
blood vessels (42, 43) particularly in tgf-␣-expressing tumors, in
which tgf-␣ itself may up-regulate egfr expression in activated
endothelial cells (44, 45). as a result, egfr-blocking agents might
conceivably block angiogenesis not only indirectly but also directly,
especially when such drugs are combined with chemotherapy. this
was shown recently by bruns et al. (22, 46), who reported significant
induction of endothelial cell apoptosis in human pancreatic or prostate
carcinoma xenograft microvessels by combination treatment with
either a small molecule egfr antagonist or  xxxd467xxx  and gemcitabine.
third, acquired resistance may also be delayed by more protracted
treatment with the abs, i.e., continuing the treatment in tumors that do
not regress after eight injections and even after tumors have regressed,
or by combining the ab treatment with other therapeutic modalities
such as chemotherapy or radiation, which is currently the way egfrblocking drugs are used clinically (7, 41). in this regard, another
interesting feature of our results is the necessity of undertaking
very-long-term (e.g., up to one year) in vivo experiments to detect the
emergence of resistant variants, an approach lacking in virtually all
previous studies using such therapeutic agents.
we must also acknowledge the possible influence on the results
as a consequence of using exclusively the a431 cell line for our
studies, a cell line that expresses a very high number of egfrs and
that is known for its hypersensitivity to egfr-blocking drugs in
vivo. analysis of other cell lines that have fewer numbers of egfr
may not reveal evidence of acquired resistance or, alternatively,
may reveal evidence for such resistance but involving different
mechanisms.
possible impact of altered vegf expression and tumor
angiogenesis in the resistant phenotype. one of the most interesting (and unexpected) findings of this study was the absence of an
obvious alteration in the egfr status in the r variants, which we
established by different means, including western blot analysis of
egfr expression and evaluation of the growth response of the variants to egfr-blocking abs ( xxxd467xxx  and  xxxd2729xxx ), as well as the determination of levels of phospho-active egfr after stimulation with increasing concentrations of tgf-␣. we reasoned that major changes in
the level of expression of egfr and/or its ligands could translate into
a different biological response to ligand-induced stimulation and/or
phosphorylation (i.e., activation). however, we did not find any
evidence for such changes. of considerable importance in this regard
was the virtually identical in vitro growth characteristics and inhibitory responses to treatment with the anti-egfr blocking abs of the
variants, compared with the parental cell line. thus, interestingly, the
resistant phenotype manifested itself only in vivo. one possible explanation for this would be a reduced sensitivity to undergoing fc
receptor-mediated adcc, a host process that can take place only in
vivo and that has been implicated as a major determinant of response
to certain therapeutic abs such as herceptin and rituxin (47). however, adcc does not appear to be similarly important for the antitumor activity of  xxxd467xxx , because f(ab⬘)2 fragments of this ab, which
cannot activate an adcc response, still retain a significant growth
inhibitory activity against a431 tumor xenografts (48). hence, we
reasoned that an alternative host-dependent mechanism, namely angiogenesis (a process required in vivo but not in vitro for tumor
growth), could conceivably contribute, at least in part, to the resistant
phenotype.

with four doses of 0.25 mg  xxxd467xxx , given i.p every

we, therefore, examined the r variants for changes in the expression of vegf, not only because vegf is a potent inducer of tumor
angiogenesis in general but also because a431 cells have been shown
to be highly dependent on vegf for angiogenesis and, hence, in vivo
growth (38). we found that five of six of the resistant variants express
a significantly higher level of vegf than does the parental line.
relative vegf levels appeared to correlate with the in vivo growth of
the variants as well as with their angiogenic profiles. staining of
vegf on sections derived from r1 and r5 s.c. tumor xenografts
suggests that these tumors express a higher overall amount of vegf,
mainly attributable to an increase in the ratio of vegf expressing:
nonexpressing cells. the mechanism responsible for this change is
unknown, but it is likely that anti-egfr ab treatment selects for
a431 subpopulations with an elevated degree of vegf expression.
in addition to altered patterns of vegf expression, we also
found that variants r1 and r5 possessed conspicuously large blood
vessels, which we suggest is the result of increased vegf-dependent angiogenesis, because blocking vegf signaling with a vegfneutralizing ab reduces the size of these vessels (fig. 6). the
presence of such large vessels is a hallmark of pathological vegf-

dependent angiogenesis (40, 49). a recent study in which the
properties of newly formed vessels induced by vegf/vpf164 have
been investigated in detail showed that large vessels are commonly
found in situations of vegf overexpression and are referred to as
“mother vessels” (40). we found a striking resemblance between
these mother vessels and the large vessels found in r variants,
particularly r5. we also found similar, but even more enlarged,
vascular channels in the tumors formed from a431 cells transfected with the mvegf164 gene.
our results raise the interesting possibility that, when applicable,
assessment of changes in the number of such mother vessels (as
opposed to changes in microvessel counts or density) could be a
useful surrogate marker to evaluate and monitor the activity of certain
anti-angiogenic drugs. however, measurement of vascular density
seems inappropriate, as it is difficult to establish the margins of an
individual vessel. because of their compartmentalization, it is difficult
to determine whether the structures that we detected correspond to
several vessels or to just one vessel, subdivided into several compartments. for this reason, we did not undertake vessel counts in the
present study.

fig. 6. different patterns of vegf staining and enlarged vascular channels in tumors derived from a431 r variants. a, d, and g, vegf staining (red) of a431p, r1, and r5 tumor
sections, respectively. in the a431p tumors (a) the staining is localized to subgroups of moderately- to well-differentiated cells. some tumor cells, usually smaller in size, are negative
for vegf protein expression. in both r1 and r5 (d and g) tumors, vegf staining appears diffuse, with the majority of the cells being strongly positive. b, c, e, f, h, and i, staining
of the endothelial cell-associated antigen  xxxg1724xxx  (red) in a431p (b and c), r1 (e and f), and r5 (h and i) tumor sections. tumor-bearing mice were either treated with pbs (b, e,
and h) or with the vegf-neutralizing ab 4301-42-35 (c, f, and i) for 1 week prior to tumor recovery (see “materials and methods” for details). no significant differences in vascular
density were found among control tumors of a431p, r1, or r5 (b, e, and h, respectively). however, vascular channels are highly enlarged in both r1 (e) and r5 (h) tumors compared
with a431p (b) tumors. in r5 tumors, these vascular channels seem highly complex, showing abnormally enlarged lumens divided into several compartments (h).  xxxd328xxx  treatment
causes a reduction in blood vessel counts in a431p tumors (c versus b) and a remarkable reduction in both vessel size and complexity, in both r1 (f versus e) and r5 (i versus h)
tumors.

possible mechanisms of increased vegf production in the r
variants. an obvious and important question raised by our results
concerns the mechanism responsible for the elevated vegf levels
detected in the r variants. at present, we do not know the answer, but
there are a number of possibilities. for example, several different
oncogenes, when activated, are known to induce or up-regulate vegf
(39). these include ras, src, and erbb2/neu (39, 50), among others.
likewise certain tumor suppressor genes, such as p53, vhl, or pten,
when mutated/inactivated, can result in elevated vegf (39, 51). thus
the variants may express elevated vegf levels as a result of the
selection of cells possessing one or more such genetic changes during
the egfr ab-mediated therapy. alternatively, aberrations in signaling pathways downstream of egfr activation that are known to affect
vegf expression could conceivably be involved. such changes, for
example, could include phosphatidylinositol 3⬘-kinase ( xxxg1743xxx  kinase;
refs. 51, 52), and/or src kinase (39, 53, 54) overactivation, and/or ras
mutation (30, 39). preliminary data suggest that neither increased src
nor ras activity are obvious in the resistant variants of a431 (data not
shown). whatever the mechanism(s), the magnitude of the increase in
vegf that we detected in the variants could significantly increase

tumor angiogenesis, based on results reported in several previous
studies, using gene transfection approaches (55, 56).
our results demonstrate that, in principle, acquired resistance to
agents that block tumor cell egfr function can develop in vivo.
however, the extent of this resistance, and the rate at which it
develops, appear encouraging for use of such drugs in the clinic,
especially because they are frequently used as chemotherapy or radiation sensitizers, rather than single agents. the basis of acquired
resistance in the a431 system appears, at least in part, to have a link
with tumor angiogenesis, an observation that strengthens the putative
linkage established between oncogene function, including that of
oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases, and tumor angiogenesis (39).
finally, we do not wish to infer that acquired resistance to egfr
inhibitors, when it occurs, will always involve the latter type of
mechanism. tumor cell resistance mechanisms with respect to chemotherapeutic drugs and other agents, e.g., st1571 (17, 57), are
usually highly pleiotropic, and the same is likely to be true for
inhibitors of egfr signaling. indeed, the basis of acquired resistance
of one of the six a431 variants that we analyzed, r6, is different from
that of variants r1–r5 and may not involve altered angiogenesis. it

would be of interest, in this respect, to test other egfr-positive cell
lines for the possibility of additional mechanisms of acquired resistance, and to use different antagonists of egfr function for their
selection.
