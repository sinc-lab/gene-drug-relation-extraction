african sleeping sickness is caused by a unicellular protozoan
belonging to the class of zooflagellates (1). two subspecies are
responsible for causing the sickness in humans: trypanosoma brucei gambiense and t. b. rhodesiense. the former one is
affecting countries in western and central africa, causing a
chronic form of the sickness where the symptoms will not be
evident until months or even years after the infection. t. b.
rhodesiense on the other hand, is restricted to eastern and
southern africa, causing an acute illness within a few weeks
after the infection (2). the trypanosomes are spread by tsetse
flies and transmitted to humans in fly saliva upon a bite. a
variant specific glycoprotein (vsg) coat enables the parasite to
escape destruction by the host immune system (3, 4) and to
eventually cause a fatal invasion of the central nervous system.

there are only two drugs known to be effective against the
late stage of the disease, dl-␣- xxxd2430xxx 
( xxxd1972xxx ,2 eflornithine) and melarsoprol.  xxxd1972xxx  can only cure
t. b. gambiense infections. furthermore, because of the lengthy
infusion schedules, it can only be administrated in a hospital
setting. melarsoprol, an old arsenical derivative, also has to be
given by infusion but in addition is causing serious side effects
such as fatal encephalopathy in as high as 10% of the cases.
furthermore, there is an increasing resistance to melarsoprol
reaching almost 30% in central africa (2). because of the highly
variable nature of the glycoprotein coat, all attempts to develop
an efficient vaccine have met with little success.
ctp pools in trypanosomes were previously demonstrated to
be very low compared with other eukaryotic cells and trypanosomes totally lack the ability to salvage cytosine or cytidine (5,
6). ctp is essential for the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and
phospholipids (7–9), both necessary for cell survival. for these
reasons, t. brucei ctp synthetase, a  xxxg920xxx  responsible for de novo synthesis of ctp, was suggested
to be a potential drug target for treatment of african sleeping
sickness (6).
ctp synthetase ( xxxg546xxx ) was originally identified 1955 in
escherichia coli by lieberman, who showed that the enzyme
catalyzes the conversion of utp to ctp in the presence of atp,
ammonia, and magnesium (10). the bacterial enzyme can use
glutamine as an alternate nitrogen donor when gtp is present
as an allosteric effector (11). atp and utp were shown to
induce a tetrameric form of the enzyme (12). the partially purified  xxxg546xxx  from calf or rat liver shows strong similarity to the
bacterial enzyme but the mammalian enzyme has no absolute
requirement for gtp in the presence of glutamine as a substrate (13, 14). the crystal structures of  xxxg546xxx  from e. coli and
thermus thermophilus were recently reported (15, 16) as well
as the structure of the synthetase domain of human  xxxg546xxx  (17).
like other glutamine amidotransferases,  xxxg546xxx  is inhibited
by glutamine analogues (18, 19). we showed earlier that don
(6-diazo-5-oxo- xxxd2755xxx ) and  xxxd72xxx  (␣-amino-3-chloro4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid) reduced the already low
parasitic ctp levels even further and inhibited t. brucei growth
in vitro (6). addition of  xxxd72xxx  to cultured bloodstream t. brucei specifically lowered the parasitic ctp and gtp pools without affecting the atp and utp pools indicating that the main

african sleeping sickness is a fatal disease caused by two parasite subspecies: trypanosoma brucei gambiense and t. b. rhodesiense. we previously reported that trypanosomes have extraordinary low ctp pools compared with mammalian cells.
trypanosomes also lack salvage of cytidine/cytosine making the
parasite ctp synthetase a potential target for treatment of the
disease. in this study, we have expressed and purified recombinant t. brucei ctp synthetase. the enzyme has a higher km
value for utp than the mammalian ctp synthetase, which in
combination with a lower utp pool may account for the low
ctp pool in trypanosomes. the activity of the trypanosome
ctp synthetase is irreversibly inhibited by the glutamine analogue  xxxd72xxx , a drug extensively tested as an antitumor agent.
there is a rapid uptake of  xxxd72xxx  in mice both given intraperitoneally and orally by gavage. daily injection of  xxxd72xxx  in
trypanosome-infected mice suppressed the infection up to one
month without any significant loss of weight. experiments with
cultured bloodstream t. brucei showed that  xxxd72xxx  is trypanocidal if present at 1 ␮m concentration for at least 4 days. therefore,  xxxd72xxx  may qualify as a drug with “desirable” properties,
i.e. cure within 7 days, according to the current target product
profiles of who and dndi.

experimental procedures
plasmid construction—the t. brucei  xxxg546xxx  gene was amplified from genomic dna of the tc221 strain using primers with
the following sequence: 5⬘-agttaaaacggtagacgaggag-3⬘ and 5⬘-acacatatatacactagactcgtt-3⬘.
using the diluted (100⫻) pcr product as a template, a second
round of pcr was performed. this time one of the primers
contained an ndei recognition sequence followed by a his6
coding region and a tobacco etch virus protease recognition
sequence preceding the start codon: 5⬘-catatgcatcaccatcaccatcacgattacgatatcccaacgaccgaaaacctgtattttcagggcatggaaggcagtgcaactgcg-3⬘. the reverse primer contained an ecor1 recognition
sequence: 5⬘-gaattccgtatccaaacacagcgcatc-3⬘.
upon digestion of the pcr product with ecor1 and ndei, the
dna was cloned into a petm2 vector replacing the m2cdna
(30).
expression and purification of recombinant t. brucei ctp
synthetase—his6-tev protease site-tagged t. brucei ctp synthetase was expressed in bl21(de3) plyss bacteria. the cells
were grown at 15 °c in terrific broth medium supplemented
with 84 ␮m chloramphenicol (usb) and 118 ␮m carbenicillin

100 mm nacl, 1 mm edta and after centrifugation (as above)
resuspended in two volumes of 50 mm hepes buffer ph 7.3, 0.2
m naac. the cells were disrupted by three cycles of freezing and
thawing. the crude extract was centrifuged in an ultracentrifuge for 1 h at 150,000 ⫻ g at 4 °c.
the supernatant was added to a talon metal affinity resin
(clontech) equilibrated with 50 mm hepes buffer ph 7.3, 0.2 m
naac and incubated for 1 h at 4 °c on a rotary platform. the
resin was pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 ⫻ g for 4 min at 4 °c
and washed once with 10 resin volumes of the same buffer.
after repelleting, the talon resin was washed twice with 50 mm
hepes buffer, ph 7.3, 0.2 m naac supplemented with 5 mm
imidazole. following the second imidazole wash, the resin was
packed into a glass econo-column (bio-rad), and the  xxxg546xxx 
was eluted from the column with 50 mm hepes buffer ph 7.3,
0.2 m naac supplemented with 80 mm imidazole. the eluate
was chromatographed through a sephadex g-50 (amersham
biosciences) column in 50 mm hepes buffer ph 7.3, 0.2 m naac
to remove the imidazole, and the protein-containing fractions
were concentrated in a 10-kda vivaspin 6 concentrator (viva
science) at 2000 ⫻ g. a ni-nta purified his6-tev protease
(the pet9d construct was kindly provided by günther stier,
embl, heidelberg) was added to the concentrated solution,
and proteolysis was performed at 23 °c for 40 min. the protein
solution was then loaded again on a talon resin column but this
time the flow-through, containing  xxxg546xxx  without his tag, was
collected. finally a 0.2-ml source q 15 medium column (amersham biosciences) was packed and equilibrated with 50 mm
hepes buffer, ph 7.3, 0.2 m naac. the protein solution was
loaded onto the column which was eluted with 5 column volumes of the same buffer. the flow through fractions containing
t. brucei  xxxg546xxx  were collected and pooled. after the addition of

targets in the parasite are  xxxg546xxx  and  xxxg920xxx  like in
mammalian cells. addition of guanine, cytosine and cytidine to
the growth medium restored the gtp pool but neither restored
the ctp pool nor growth.  xxxd72xxx  is potentially a better drug
candidate than don since it penetrates the blood-brain barrier
and has a longer in vivo half-life (20 –22).  xxxd72xxx  was isolated
from cultures of streptomyces sviceus 1973 and shown to irreversibly inhibit glutamine amidotransferases by alkylating a
nucleophilic active site cysteine (23, 24). pharmacokinetic and
toxicity studies in several animal models and in human cancer
patients extensively characterized the efficacy and the doselimiting cns toxicity of  xxxd72xxx  as an anti-tumor agent (20, 21,
25–28). however, the ability of tumor cells to salvage purines
and pyrimidines provided resistance against  xxxd72xxx  treatment
and limited its value as an anti-tumor drug (25, 29).
in this study, we have expressed and purified recombinant
t. brucei  xxxg546xxx  to homogeneity. kinetic studies of the pure
enzyme indicate that the low ctp pools in trypanosomes are a
consequence of the high km for utp compared with the mammalian enzyme. the trypanosome  xxxg546xxx  showed the same
strong affinity for  xxxd72xxx  as the rat liver enzyme but preincubation of the trypanosome enzyme in the presence of the nucleotide substrates together with  xxxd72xxx  strengthened the inhibition. our in vivo experiments demonstrate that it is possible to
suppress trypanosome infections in mice for at least one month
periods using  xxxd72xxx  without serious side effects. experiments
with cultured bloodstream t. brucei in vitro showed that  xxxd72xxx  has a trypanocidal effect if present in 1 ␮m concentration for
at least 4 days. this concentration is well below the concentration of 5 ␮m in human plasma where cns toxicity starts to
appear if the drug is present more than 16 h (27). analyses of
 xxxd72xxx  levels in mouse blood showed that oral administration
of drug results in almost the same rapid uptake as intraperitoneal administration with a half-life of about 72 min increasing
its potential value for treatment of african sleeping sickness.

edta to a final concentration of 1 mm, the protein solution was
frozen and stored at ⫺70 °c.
standard  xxxg546xxx  activity assays and protein determination—
protein concentrations were determined by the bio-rad protein assay. the standard activity assay mixture consisted of
0.1–1 ␮g of  xxxg546xxx  in 50 ␮l of reaction buffer (0.2 m kcl, 20
mm dithiothreitol (dtt), 30 mm mgcl2, 0.4 mm gtp, 4 mm
[3h]utp (specific activity 18,000 cpm/nmol), 8 mm atp, 5 mm
l-glutamine, and 50 mm hepes ph 7.3). before the start of the
reaction by the addition of l-glutamine, the reaction mixtures
were preincubated at 37 °c for 1 min. the reactions were run
for 5 min at the same temperature, stopped by the addition of
0.5 ml of 1 m perchloric acid and incubated on ice for 10 min.
before centrifugation at 21,000 ⫻ g for 10 min, to remove the
precipitated proteins, 250 nmol of carrier ctp were added. the
supernatants were boiled in a water bath for 10 min to hydrolyze the nucleotides to monophosphates and then cooled on ice.
the samples were neutralized by koh and centrifuged for 2
min at 21,000 ⫻ g at room temperature. finally, the supernatants were loaded onto glass econo-columns packed with 4 ml
of dowex 50 wx8, 400 mesh cation exchange medium (sigma
aldrich). the columns were first washed with 20 ml of 1 mm
hcl followed by a 12 ml wash with 0.2 m hcl. the cmp was
eluted in an additional 5 ml of 0.2 m hcl and the concentration
determined from the absorbance at 280 nm. the amount of
radioactive product was determined by mixing 1 ml of eluate
with 10 ml of ready safe scintillation liquid (beckman coulter)
followed by vigorous shaking and counting in a beckman ls 600
series liquid scintillation system. one unit of  xxxg546xxx  activity is
defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1
nmol of ctp per minute. km values were obtained by fitting the
data to a hyperbola using the graphpad prism program.
inhibition of t. brucei  xxxg546xxx  activity by  xxxd72xxx —inhibition
by  xxxd72xxx  was determined by studying the initial velocity of the
enzyme reaction as a function of glutamine concentration at
various  xxxd72xxx  concentrations. using the standard reaction
mixture,  xxxd72xxx  was added at the same time as l-glutamine. to
be able to compare the inhibition by  xxxd72xxx  of t. brucei  xxxg546xxx 
with the published value of the mammalian  xxxg546xxx , the ki value
for  xxxd72xxx  was obtained from a dixon plot (31). the preincubation experiments were performed as follows: recombinant

t. brucei  xxxg546xxx  (0.25 ␮g/␮l) in 50 mm hepes buffer ph 7.3, 0.2
m kcl was incubated in the presence or absence of 12 ␮m  xxxd72xxx , 8 mm atp, 30 mm mgcl2, 0.4 mm gtp, and 4 mm [3h]utp.
the mixtures were preincubated from 1 to 5 min at 37 °c, and then
2 ␮l were transferred to 48 ␮l of preincubated standard reaction
mixture containing 5 mm l-glutamine. the reactions were stopped
after 5 min and processed as above. the same results were
obtained with and without dtt in the preincubation mixture.
oligomeric structure of t. brucei  xxxg546xxx —analyses of the various oligomeric forms of recombinant t. brucei  xxxg546xxx  were
made by gas-phase electrophoretic mobility macromolecule/
nanoparticle analysis (gemma) (32–34). prior to running the
samples in the gemma machine, the 50 mm hepes, 0.2 m naac
buffer ph 7.3 was changed to the volatile 0.2 m ammonium
acetate ph 7.3, using vivaspin 500 5 kda concentrators. the
sample consisted of 20 ␮g/ml  xxxg546xxx  in 50 mm ammonium acetate ph 7.3 supplemented with 0.005% tween 20 and 10 ␮m
mgcl2. for the determination of the oligomerization state in
the presence of nucleotide substrates, atp or utp was added,
either separately or together each at 20 ␮m.
 xxxd72xxx  treatment of t. brucei-infected mice and  xxxd72xxx 
plasma measurements—t. brucei (tc221) infected c57bl
male mice weighing 30 g were treated with daily intraperitoneal
(intraperitoneal) injections of  xxxd72xxx . alternatively, the mice
were given a daily 10 mg/kg  xxxd72xxx  dose per os in the drinking
water assuming a daily intake of ⬃5 ml of water. the levels of
trypanosomes in the blood were followed by inspection of
blood samples with a microscope with a detection limit of 0.1
million trypanosomes/ml.  xxxd72xxx  plasma concentrations in
mice were measured by adding 15 ␮l of plasma to paper filters
(oxoid) and placing them on bacillus subtilis plated on complete synthetic medium plates (23). zones of inhibition were
measured after 15–18 h incubation at 37 °c. the concentration
of the drug was estimated from standard curves by comparing
the inhibition zones to those obtained by samples with known
 xxxd72xxx  concentrations (23, 35).
effects of  xxxd72xxx  on cultured bloodstream t. brucei—
t. brucei (tc221) parasites were propagated at 37 °c in 7% co2
in a humified atmosphere in hirumi⬘s modified iscove⬘s medium-9 (36) containing 0.4 mm l-glutamine and 10% fetal calf
serum. in a series of tubes, 2 ml of culture containing around
200,000 trypanosomes/ml were incubated with 1–5 ␮m  xxxd72xxx 
for 72 or 96 h. then the cells were collected by centrifugation at
1500 ⫻ g for 3 min, washed once with phosphate-buffered
saline and finally resuspended in fresh hmi-9 medium without
drug. during the experiment, trypanosome levels were monitored by counting the cells in a microscope with a detection
limit of 1000 cells/ml.

teria had to be grown at 15 °c to
maximize the expression of the soluble form of the recombinant
enzyme. the low expression levels
of soluble protein required the use
of metal affinity chromatography on
a co2⫹-bearing sepharose medium
called talon resin. the second
talon chromatography step was
preceded by the removal of imidazole on a sephadex g-50 column and
cleavage of the histidine tag by

seven amino acids, exxyxq2(s/g) (37). a shift in mobility of
the t. brucei  xxxg546xxx  seen on the sds-page confirmed the successful proteolysis (fig. 1). by loading the protein solution a
second time onto the talon resin, we removed the his-tagged
tev protease together with most of the impurities eluted from
the first affinity step while we collected the purified  xxxg546xxx  in the
flow-through fraction. as a final purification step, a strong
anion exchanger, source q 15 sepharose, was employed. again,
the flow-through fraction contained highly purified, recombinant  xxxg546xxx  leaving most of the impurities bound to the column
(fig. 1). during the purification, the specific activity of the
enzyme preparation increased 836-fold and the total yield was
28% (table 1).
enzyme kinetics and  xxxd72xxx  inhibition—the specific activity of the pure enzyme was determined to 550 units/mg, a value,
which is close to the specific activity of the highly purified rat

(table 2). two striking differences between the published values of mammalian  xxxg546xxx  and the values of the trypanosome
enzyme were observed. (i) the km of the trypanosome enzyme
for utp is two times higher compared with the corresponding
value for the mammalian  xxxg546xxx  (0.16 mm and 0.07 mm, respectively) (14). (ii) the km of t. brucei  xxxg546xxx  for atp is much
lower than the corresponding value for the mammalian  xxxg546xxx 
(0.07 mm compared with 0.91 mm). it appears as even though
the velocity of the reaction is increased 7-fold when the
trypanosome enzyme is saturated with atp, the enzyme shows
no absolute requirement for atp when all the other four
ligands are present at saturating concentrations. most probably, atp can be substituted against gtp, without which there is
no reaction (fig. 2).
the conditions and methods for measuring the inhibition

from the gemma experiments, we
could observe that at an enzyme
concentration of 20 ␮g/ml, which is
similar to the concentration in the
activity assay, the dominating forms
of the trypanosome  xxxg546xxx  in the
absence of nucleotides were monomers and tetramers. the concentration of dimers was about half of the
monomer or tetramer concentration (fig. 5a). after the addition of
20 ␮m atp or utp alone or in
combination, the balance strongly
shifted toward the tetrameric form
(fig. 5, b–d) indicating that the
active form of the trypanosome
 xxxg546xxx  is a tetramer.

previously published data (31, 35)
and our own toxicity studies (fig. 6)
we could observe that at a daily

 xxxd72xxx  in male mice, the animals
gradually lost their weight suggesting severe side effects. on the other
hand, a daily dose of 5 mg/kg (fig. 6)

during the same period. in non-infected mice, the leukocyte count did

around 12 ⫻ 106 cells/ml to 5 ⫻ 106 cells/ml but after the daily
injections of 5 mg  xxxd72xxx /kg for 20 days the leukocyte count
was still around 2.5 ⫻ 106 cells/ml (data not shown).
typically, intraperitoneal injection of 2 ⫻ 105 trypanosomes
of the strain tc221 in a mouse resulted in a rapid increase in

the trypanosomes in the blood rapidly decreased from around

discussion
we have previously determined
that the unusually low ctp pools in
t. brucei are a direct result of slow
ctp synthesis and not a consequence of increased turnover (6).
this finding made the trypanosome
 xxxg546xxx  a potential target for the
treatment of african sleeping sickness. addition of cytidine or cytosine to the medium had no effect on
the lowered trypanosome ctp
pools or growth inhibition after
 xxxd72xxx  treatment demonstrating
the essential role of  xxxg546xxx  in the
absence of salvage (6).

from the rapid restitution of growth after removal of the drug. by the fact that trypanosomes in contrast to mammalian cells

rely exclusively on de novo ctp synthesis. furthermore, the
inhibition of trypanosome  xxxg546xxx  is greatly enhanced when
the enzyme is preincubated with drug in the presence of its
natural nucleotide substrates as compared with a preincubation in their absence. probably, the nucleotides induce structural changes in the enzyme promoting the irreversible inactivation by  xxxd72xxx , an explanation given for a similar
behavior of other glutamine amidotransferases but up to
now not described for  xxxg546xxx  (39).
previous studies of e. coli and mammalian  xxxg546xxx  (13, 40) suggested that the active form of the enzyme is a tetramer. however, these data were obtained by ultracentrifugation and gel
filtration experiments performed at much higher protein concentrations than the concentrations of enzyme used in the assay
(12, 13, 40, 41). using the very sensitive gemma technique, we
could directly demonstrate that the predominant form of
trypanosome  xxxg546xxx  during the assay in the presence of atp/
utp is indeed tetramers. interestingly, we could observe the
presence of tetramers even in the absence of nucleotides and at
low protein concentrations.

were cultivated in vitro in the presence of 1 ␮m  xxxd72xxx  (f), 2 ␮m  xxxd72xxx  (œ),
5 ␮m  xxxd72xxx  () or in the absence of drug (⽧). after 72 h (a) or 96 h (b)
incubation, the drug was removed, and the trypanosomes were further cultivated in the absence of drug. the arrows indicate the time of drug removal.
each point was run in duplicate to minimize statistical errors.

although daily  xxxd72xxx  injections so far did not permanently
cure mice from infection with the strain tc221 of trypanosomes, we have been able to suppress the infection in a mouse
for one month. intriguingly, when the drug was given ad libitum for 5 days in the drinking water at a nominal dose of 10
mg/kg, we could in one case observe that the reoccurrence of
trypanosomes was postponed 8 days (data not shown). this
suggests that the way and frequency of the distribution of  xxxd72xxx  could prove to be decisive for permanent cure of the infection. from our measurements of the concentration of  xxxd72xxx 
in the blood (fig. 6) it is obvious that after one single intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/kg, the plasma concentrations are
above 1 ␮m for only about 3 h. hopefully, a more evenly distributed intake of the drug over the course of the day instead of a
single injection leading to more constant plasma levels may
more efficiently affect the growth of trypanosomes.
this hypothesis is strongly supported by our in vitro data
clearly demonstrating the trypanocidal effect of  xxxd72xxx  if given
continuously in concentrations of 1 ␮m for at least 96 h. it is
evident from these experiments that the duration of drug in the
medium is more important than a high concentration. in phase
i clinical trials with  xxxd72xxx  to cure human cancer, the doselimiting factor was cns toxicity (27, 28). in these trials, plasma
levels at the end of 72 h continuous infusions ranged from 0.5 to
6 ␮m where cns toxicity correlated to  xxxd72xxx  levels exceeding
5 ␮m for more than 16 h. to obtain plasma levels of  xxxd72xxx  of
1 ␮m, a dose of 15–30 mg/m2 should be administered over a
24-h period, and this is well below the starting dose of 60 mg/m2
recommended for phase ii clinical trials in treatment of solid
tumors (27).
it was reported earlier that inhibition of l1210 mouse leukemia cells growth in vitro by  xxxd72xxx  is antagonized by combinations of cytidine and guanosine (31). these nucleosides can be
salvaged by mammalian cells to supply cmp and gmp for their
nucleotide metabolism. however, trypanosomes are unable to
salvage cytosine or cytidine and therefore a combination of
 xxxd72xxx  with cytidine and guanosine may lower the side effects
of the drug in humans.
an advantage of  xxxd72xxx  compared with melarsoprol or
 xxxd1972xxx  may be that the drug can be given orally. in our experiments we could show that  xxxd72xxx  is almost as rapidly
absorbed through an intragastric administration by gavage as
through an intraperitoneal injection.
with emerging reports of spread of the  xxxd1972xxx  resistant t. b.
rhodesiense (45, 46) into the endemic areas of t. b. gambiense
there is an increasing risk of an ineffective treatment of the
patients. furthermore, because eflornithine is now used with
increased frequency there is a concern that the parasites will
inevitably develop resistance against the drug. several trials
involving combination therapy are currently under evaluation
(47). much like  xxxd1972xxx ,  xxxd72xxx  has already undergone extensive clinical trials as an anti-cancer drug and the toxicity in
human patients and mechanism of action is well characterized.
if our in vitro results are valid also in vivo,  xxxd72xxx  would classify
as a drug with “desirable” properties, i.e. complete cure within 7
days, according to the current target product profiles of who
and dndi.
