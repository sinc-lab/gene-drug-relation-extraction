introduction

 xxxd321xxx , which acts as an orally active histamine analog, has intrigued scientists
since it was first synthesized. early attempts for use were centred on the ability
of this compound to cause vasodilatation in the cerebral vasculature. with the
expanding knowledge on histamine, in general, and on its role as a neurotransmitter in particular, potential new indications for this compound have emerged
with weight control as perhaps the most interesting of these potential indications.
this review outlines the unique pharmacological properties of  xxxd321xxx ,
describes past and present clinical uses, and current attempts to use it as a weight
management agent.
2.

historical aspects

 xxxd321xxx  originally synthesized by loffler in 1904 [1]. it was studied pharmacologically in the 1940s by walter, hunt and foasbinder in comparison with a
number of pyridylalkylamines for possible sympathomimetic activity [2,3]. the
authors initially assumed that due to the chemical structure of  xxxd321xxx  it will
act as a sympatomimetic agent and were surprised to discover that it possesses
numerous histamine-like effects. these findings did not escape horton and
co-workers, who were the first to put this agent to clinical use. intrigued with the
oral activity of  xxxd321xxx , in contrast to the relative oral inactivity of histamine,
they carried out extensive clinical studies and accepted  xxxd321xxx  as a drug of
value in the treatment of certain vascular and vasomotor neurologic diseases [4,5].
in the mid-1960s the drug was evaluated for the management of meniere’s
disease [6], for which it is still used today.

pharmacology

histamine mediates all its actions through four distinct histamine receptors, the
h1, h2, h3 and h4 receptors. all four histamine receptors have been identified
as g-protein-coupled receptors. a review of histamine receptor pharmacology is

beyond the scope of this manuscript and the readers are
referred to recently published reviews [7].
in general, outside the cns, histamine has been shown
to modulate inflammatory responses through h1 receptors
and to modulate gastric acid secretion through h2 receptors.
histamine release, as well as the release of other transmitters,
is inhibited by the h3 receptor. the h3 receptor, first
characterized as an autoreceptor, has been presumed to exist
on histaminergic fibers and to regulate histamine synthesis
and release in the cns [8]. the  xxxg1081xxx  is mainly
expressed peripherally, in blood cells and in the spleen and
bone marrow cells. this receptor modulates the chemotaxis
of several of these cell types and also modulates cytokine
production. furthermore, recent evidence suggests that the
receptor plays a role in t-cell activation [9].
outside of the brain, histamine is known to relax vascular
smooth muscle by activation of endothelial h1 receptors,
thereby increasing endothelial ca2+ concentrations and
stimulating the synthesis and release of  xxxd2738xxx .
 xxxd321xxx  (n-methyl-n-beta-[2-pyridyl]ethylamine dihydrochloride; figure 1) is an orally administered, centrally
acting  xxxg1078xxx  agonist with partial h3 antagonistic
activity and no h2–binding effects [10-12].  xxxd321xxx 
binds and activates the  xxxg1078xxx , however it does
not bind to the  xxxg1079xxx , and it antagonizes the
h3 receptor. combined with its blood–brain barrier and
prolonged half-life compared with histamine,  xxxd321xxx 
is a more selective and potent activator of h1 receptors
in the brain (table 1).
 xxxd321xxx  interacts with the  xxxg1078xxx 
with an agonist activity of ∼ 0.1 times that of histamine.
in vivo studies have confirmed this h1 histamine-like
activity, showing that  xxxd321xxx  induces bronchoconstriction and increased vasopermeability after parenteral
administration [13-15]. the hypotensive response produced
796

in vivo by  xxxd321xxx  can be blocked by h1-receptor
antagonists [12,13,16].
unlike histamine,  xxxd321xxx  is virtually inactive at the
 xxxg1079xxx . even large parenteral doses of  xxxd321xxx 
produce only marginal increases in gastric acid secretion [17].
no h2-agonist activity was noted in heart muscle [11] and
 xxxd321xxx  did not produce relaxation in the rat uterus [12].
receptor binding studies have shown that  xxxd321xxx  is a
potent h3-receptor antagonist [10,18].
3.1

 xxxd321xxx  in the cns

the cell bodies of histamine-containing neurons project
throughout the brain, including the ventromedial
hypothalamic nucleus, the thalamus and the cerebral
cortex [19-21]. four types of histamine receptor have been
identified: h1, h2, h3 and h4 [22]. h1 receptors are located
postsynaptically and are found in the hypothalamus, cerebral
cortex, basal forebrain and limbic system [23,24]. h2 receptors
are also located postsynaptically and occur at high density in
the basal ganglia and parts of the limbic system such as the
hippocampal formation and amygdale [25]. h3 receptors are
located on the axon terminals of histamine-containing
neurons, where they serve as autoreceptors to modulate
histamine synthesis and release [26]. high densities of
h3 receptors are found in the cerebral cortex, nucleus
accumbens, striatum, olfactory tubercles and substantia
nigra [27]. unlike h1 – 3 receptors, h4 receptors have not
been observed in the brains of rats and mice [28].
in rat brains,  xxxd321xxx  and histamine had similar binding
affinities to h1 histamine receptors [7].  xxxd321xxx  did not
bind to h2 histamine receptors, and it bound with a micromolar affinity to h3 histamine receptors, whereas histamine
bound to h3 receptors with an affinity of ∼ 10-8m (table 2).
in mouse cerebellum,  xxxd3050xxx  and triprolidine, two
h1-receptor antagonists, inhibited the  xxxd321xxx -induced
glycogenolysis with ki values of 28 and 7 nm, respectively [9].
 xxxd321xxx  was not an agonist at histamine h3 autoreceptors,
but was a rather potent antagonist of the inhibitory effect
of exogenous histamine on [3h]histamine release elicited
by k+ depolarization in slices from rat cerebral cortex
(ki = 6.9 µm).
by using a novel surgical approach, a laser doppler probe
was placed in the posterior semicircular canal ampulla of
guinea-pigs. blood pressure, heart rate and vestibular blood
flow were continuously recorded. increases in vestibular blood
flow and decreases in blood pressure were observed in response
to  xxxd321xxx  infusions. these results show that  xxxd321xxx 
administration induces increases in vestibular blood flow [29].

horton’s cephalgia [30], is a form of neurovascular headache.
cluster headache is an uncommon yet distinctive neurovascular
syndrome occurring in either episodic or chronic patterns. the
most unique feature of cluster headache is the unmistakable
circadian and circannual periodicity. the attacks are stereotypical, that is, of extreme intensity, of short duration, occurring unilaterally and associated with robust signs and
symptoms of autonomic dysfunction. each headache is brief in
duration and cluster refers to a grouping of headaches, usually
over a period of several weeks [31]. this condition was first
described by horton [32], who was also first to use  xxxd321xxx 
as a remedy for this condition; however, today other modalities
are used for the treatment of this condition [33].
4.2

meniere’s disease

ménière’s disease is characterized by spontaneous attacks
of vertigo, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, aural
fullness, and tinnitus. the pathologic process involves
distortion of the membranous labyrinth with the formation
of endolymphatic hydrops [34].  xxxd321xxx  was approved for
the treatment of meniere’s disease in 1968 [35]. in the uk,
 xxxd321xxx  is prescribed by 94% of ear nose and throat
specialists for this indication [36].
it is estimated that over 130 million people were treated
with  xxxd321xxx  for this indication [37] and the drug showed
an excellent safety profile with an remarkably low reported
frequency of adverse drug reactions (to the marketing authorization holder), yielding an estimated rate of 1:100 000. this
review also provided an overview of the adverse-effect profile
of  xxxd321xxx . of all adverse events, 18.1% were reported
in the nervous system (mainly paresthesia, headache and
dizziness). skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders made up
17.3% of all events (mainly rashes, pruritus, edema and
urticaria). in total, 12.9% of cases presented with gastrointestinal complaints. most patients described nausea,
vomiting and unspecific abdominal pain.
a meta-analysis on the efficacy of  xxxd321xxx  for meniere’s
disease found that most trials suggested a reduction of
vertigo with  xxxd321xxx  and some suggested a reduction in
tinnitus. none of the trials showed any effect of  xxxd321xxx 
on hearing loss [38].
4.3

atherosclerotic cns disease

the ability of  xxxd321xxx  to cause vasodilatation in the cns,
prompted several investigators to evaluate this compound

for the treatment of vascular insufficiency [39]. esser et al.
studied 20 subjects with ‘chronic psychiatric patients with
symptoms of arterio sclerosis cerebri’ and found no clinical
difference in the action of the placebo and  xxxd321xxx .
however, there was an improvement in the memory capacity
in the  xxxd321xxx  group.
meyer [40] measured regional cerebral blood flow
measurements using clearance of xenon 133 and the gamma camera
before and 7 days after initiation of oral  xxxd321xxx  therapy.
regional cerebral blood flow showed statistically significant
increases after medication. this was followed by another
study [41] in which 50 patients with similar diagnosis were
treated with  xxxd321xxx  for 6 weeks. the authors found
significant improvement in cognitive function. similar findings were observed by pathy [42] who performed a doubleblind, placebo-controlled clinical study in which 53 patients
with cerberovascular disease received either  xxxd321xxx 
24 mg daily or placebo for 8 weeks. significant differences
were demonstrated between  xxxd321xxx  and placebo at
week 8 of treatment for associative learning, digit retention,
general knowledge, orientation, sentence learning and simple
arithmetic. the results of the remaining mental function
tests showed no significant differences between  xxxd321xxx 
and placebo, but trends were in favor of the former.
spruill [43] found that  xxxd321xxx  was ineffective in
prevention of transient ischemic attacks in patients prone
to this condition. and finally, hagler [44] found that
 xxxd321xxx  was ineffective in preventing retinal detachment
in subjects operated for this condition.
5.

 xxxd321xxx  and weight management

5.1

histamine and weight

brain histamine has several functions, including regulating
the neuroendocrine system [45], drinking behavior [46] and
sleep–wake cycles [47], and feeding behavior [48]. the h1 and
h3 receptors are important for regulating feeding [49,50].
in 1973, clineschmidt and lotti [51] were the first to show
that administration of histamine reduces food intake. they
administered histamine into the lateral ventricle of cats
and observed a long-term suppression of food intake.
itowi et al. [52] administered histamine continuously into the
suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus in rats.
likewise, they found that histamine reduced food intake.
in addition, an acute injection of histamine into the lateral

 xxxd321xxx 

ventricle of rats has been shown to reduce food intake [44].
furthermore, intraperitoneal injection of  xxxd2282xxx , the
histamine precursor, has been shown to have the same effect
as histamine, reducing food intake [53-55]. this is possibly
the result of an increase in brain histamine, after  xxxd2282xxx 
has been transported to the brain and converted to histamine
by the histine decarboxylase enzyme.  xxxd2628xxx  is an inhibitor
of n-methyltransferase, the enzyme that breaks down
histamine to n-methylhistamine. this compound therefore
has the ability to increase the endogenous histamine
concentration. administration of  xxxd2628xxx , both by intraperitoneal injection and by intracerebroventricular infusion,
suppresses food intake in rats [56,57]. alpha-fluoromethylhistidine
is a specific and irreversible inhibitor of the histidine
decarboxylase enzyme, and has the ability to deplete
histamine from the brain neurons. intracerebroventricular
administration of this compound significantly increases
food intake in rats [58-61]. the role of histamine in feeding
behavior and obesity has been studied in rodents’ knockout
models. jorgensen used histamine-deficient histidine
decarboxylase knockout (hdc-ko) mice that were given
either a standard diet or high-fat diet for 8 weeks. he
observed that a significant difference in body weight gain
between hdc-ko mice fed on high-fat and standard diets
was seen after 2 weeks, whereas a significant difference in
body weight gain was first observed after 5 weeks in the
wild-type (control) mice. furthermore, after 8 weeks, wildtype mice fed high-fat diet reduced their caloric intake
compared with those fed on a standard diet, whereas
hdc-ko mice showed no difference in caloric intake
between both diets [62].
masaki et al. studied histamine h1-recptor knockout mice
and found that they gradually developed mature-onset
obesity, which was accompanied by hyperphagia and
decreased expression of uncoupling protein-1 mrna [63].
together, these findings provide consistent evidence for
histamine being an anorexigenic agent.
5.2

 xxxd321xxx  for obesity management

two animal studies have evaluated the effect of  xxxd321xxx 
on food consumption in animals. the first study was
performed by rossi: [64] in this study, the effect of
different doses of  xxxd321xxx  on water and food intake
was investigated in 12 pygmy goats. the low dose
(2 mg/kg b.wt.0.75 [body weight in power of 0.75]) of
 xxxd321xxx  did not affect food intake. the injection of
 xxxd321xxx  4 or 8 mg/kg b.wt.0.75 significantly reduced food
intake at 1 h or during 6 h (8 mg/kg b.wt.0.75) postinjection.
the second study was performed by adam szelag [65].
this study has been carried out on various groups of rats,
which were given  xxxd321xxx  systemically, and its influence
on food intake has been examined. animals were divided
into three experimental groups. the first one was on a
normal diet, the second was deprived of food and the
third group was accustomed to ‘tasty’ food.
798

the first experiment investigated the influence of
 xxxd321xxx  on food intake in the group of rats kept on a
normal diet. the rats were divided into four groups and
they were given food just after intraperitoneal  xxxd321xxx 
administration at a dose of 1 mg/kg (first group, n = 10)
and a dose of 24 mg/kg (second group, n = 10), and
30 min after intragastrical  xxxd321xxx  administration at a
dose of 24 mg/kg (third group, n = 10).
the dose of 1 mg/kg i.p. reduced food intake by: 74.7,
72.9, 64.4 and 6.6% after 1, 2, 4 and 24 h, respectively.
except for the last result (after 24 h), all other results were
statistically significant.  xxxd321xxx , at the dose of 24 mg/kg,
revealed stronger activity, reducing food intake by: 93.1,
88.1, 86.7 and 81.0% after 1, 2, 4 and 24 h, respectively.
all results were statistically significant in the third group
of rats  xxxd321xxx , given intragastrically at the dose of
24 mg/kg, reduced food intake only by 21.7% (not statistically significant). after 24 h, the tested substance was more
potent and decreased food intake by 45.2% (p < 0.001).
the second experiment investigated the influence of
 xxxd321xxx  on food intake in the group of rats accustomed
to ‘tasty’ diet. the rats were divided into three groups: two
examined and one control group.  xxxd321xxx  was administered intraperitoneally at doses of 1 mg/kg (first group,
n = 8) and 8 mg/kg (second group, n = 8). thirty minutes
after intraperitoneal drug administration, the standard food
was removed and the ‘tasty’ food was given. food intake was
assessed after the next 30 min. the drug dose of 1 mg/kg
reduced the quantity of the consumed food by 40.3%
(p < 0.02). at the higher dose (8 mg/kg), the tested
substance decreased food intake considerably (by 75.8%,
p < 0.001). both results were statistically significant.
the third experiment tested the influence of  xxxd321xxx 
on food intake in the group of rats deprived of food,
trained for 10 days. the rats were fasted for 20 h/day
(water ad libitum). the first group of rats (n = 8) was
administered  xxxd321xxx  at a dose of 8 mg/kg i.p. and the
second one (n = 8) 24 mg/kg i.p. standard food was given
30 min thereafter. food intake was assessed 1, 2 and 4 h
after food had been given.  xxxd321xxx , administered at the
dose of 8 mg/kg i.p., reduced the quantity of the consumed
food by 67.5, 70.4 and 56.9% and at 24 mg/kg by 86.9,
87.0 and 75.0% after 1, 2 and 4 h, respectively. all results
were highly statistically significant (p < 0.001).
two studies evaluated the effect of  xxxd321xxx  as an antiobesity agent in humans. the first study was a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 20 obese, but
otherwise healthy, subjects aged > 18 years. subjects were
instructed to take  xxxd321xxx  16 mg or placebo  xxxd1891xxx :00
and 4:00 for a period of 28 days. no dietary guidance was
given, but subjects were instructed not to change their daily
diet or exercise routines. subjects in the  xxxd321xxx  group
lost 1.1% of their body, whereas those in the placebo group
gained 0.6%. this difference was statsically signicant with a
p-value of 0.04. analysis of nutrient composition of the

food consumed by the subjects showed reduced fat and
protein intake.
the second study was a recently completed,
fda-approved [66] phase ii study [67]. in this 12-week study,
281 obese subjects were randomized to 4 groups: placebo,
 xxxd321xxx  16 mg/day,  xxxd321xxx  32 mg/day and
 xxxd321xxx  48 mg/day. all patients were instructed to adhere
to a hypocaloric diet. the results of this study showed
that although the ‘intent-to-treat’ and the ‘per protocol’
populations did not show a statistically significant difference
in weight when compared with the placebo group, strong
age, gender and ethnicity effects were noted. when the group
of non-hispanic women aged < 50 years were analysed,
a statistically and clinically significant weight difference
between the 48 mg/day and the placebo was observed
(figure 2). these two studies demonstrate that  xxxd321xxx 
may have potential as an antiobesity agent.
5.3

 xxxd321xxx  for antipsychotic weight gain

antipsychotic medications are an important component in
the medical management of many psychotic conditions.
the first-generation antipsychotics (fgas) are still widely
available and are effective at treating positive symptoms of
psychosis, such as hallucinations and delusions. fgas do
not, however, adequately alleviate many other common and
important aspects of psychotic illness. in addition, all fgas
can produce significant extrapyramidal side effects at clinically
effective doses, leading to subjective distress, diminished
function, stigma and nonadherence [68].

the presently available second-generation antipsychotics
(sgas) vary in their efficacy, formulation, biochemistry,
receptor binding and side-effect profiles. in general, sgas
are better tolerated and more effective than the fgas. aside
from clozapine, they have become the first-line agents for
their indicated use in schizophrenia and related psychotic
disorders, and are increasingly being used off-label for
disorders such as bipolar disorder and major depression.
in the us, a conservative estimate of the prevalence of
schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders is ∼ 1%, the
prevalence of bipolar disorders is ∼ 2%, and the prevalence
of major depression is ∼ 8%. the sgas are therefore
widely used medications, and their use has important public
health ramifications [13].
although the sgas have many notable benefits compared
with their earlier counterparts, their use has been associated
with reports of dramatic weight gain, diabetes (even acute
metabolic decompensation, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis), and
an atherogenic lipid profile (increased low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol and triglyceride levels and decreased high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol).
in patients with schizophrenia and related psychotic
disorders, treatment with sgas can cause a rapid increase in
body weight in the first few months of therapy that may not
reach a plateau even after 1 year of treatment. there is,
however, much variability in weight gain among the various
sgas.  xxxd1891xxx  weeks of therapy, estimated average weight
gain with any sga treatment compared with placebo varies
in the range of ∼ 0.5 – 5.0 kg. of the various antupsychotics

 xxxd321xxx 

agents, olanzapine is the most widely prescribed [69].
unfortunately, olanzapine is also the drug most widely
associated with weight gain. nemeroff reviewed the
safety and efficacy data from four clinical trials in which
olanzapine was compared with placebo and/or the fga
haloperidol in nearly 3000 patients. olanzapine patients
had a dose-related increase in weight, achieving, after 1 year,
a mean weight gain of ∼ 12 kg with a high dose
(12.5 – 17.5 mg/day), compared with a mean weight gain
of 3 kg with a low dose (1 mg/day). weight gain was
greatest for patients who had a starting dose of olanzapine
12.5 – 17.5 mg/day and/or were underweight (as indicated
by body mass index) at the start of the study [70].
5.3.1 the mechanism responsible for weight
gain associated with second-generation
antipsychotics therapy

in general, weight gain occurs when more energy is
ingested than is expended. therefore, weight gain can be
due to increased energy intake, decreased energy expenditure,
or both.
roerig [71] performed a randomized, double-blind, parallel
group trial comparing the tolerability and effects of a
2-week exposure to olanzapine, risperidone or placebo on
weight, resting energy expenditure, and eating behaviors in
48 healthy human subjects. subjects were randomized to
receive olanzapine, risperidone or placebo. the olanzapine
group demonstrated a significant increase in weight at end
point compared with placebo. resting energy expenditures
did not reveal any differences between groups, however,
calories consumed and hunger scores were numerically
(although not statistically significant) higher in the olanzapine
group. therefore, this study shows that weight gain associated
with sga is due to increased caloric consumption, driven
by increased appetite.
hunger and satiety may be altered in people taking
sgas because of the known binding affinities of these
drugs to serotonin, noradrenaline, dopamine and particularly
histamine-h1 receptors. kroeze et al. [72] correlated indices
of short-term weight gain for 17 typical and novel antipsychotics with affinities for 12 receptors. this analysis
showed that the affinity of olanzapine to  xxxg1078xxx 
was the best predictor for weight gain. these data accord
with wirshing’s [73] suggestion that h1 affinity may be an
important determinant of sgas gain.
another proof for the role of h1 receptors in the weight
gain associated with the use of sga was recently provided
by snyder [74], who showed that these agents potently and
selectively activate hypothalamic amp-kinase, an action
abolished in mice with deletion of histamine h1 receptors.
several attempts to either treat patients that gained weight
with olanzapine or to prevent this phenomenon yielded
mixed results. compounds tested on overweight and obese
subjects treated with olanzapine include sibutramine [75],
topiramide [76] and amantadine [77].
800

poyurovsky was the first one to try and prevent the weight
gain associated with olanzapine use [78] and published a
report on three patients treated with olanzapine 10 mg/day
co-administered with  xxxd321xxx  48 mg/day. these patients
demonstrated a rapid weight gain in the first 3 weeks of the
study (71.8 + 12.4 – 75.2 + 13.5 kg), however all further
weight gain was completely blunted for the next 4 weeks
(weight at week 6 was 74.8 + 12.3 kg). this work is of a
special importance, however, it was not a placebo-controlled
study, therefore, placebo data from poyurovsky’s similar trials
(fluoxetine trial [79],  xxxd2082xxx  trial [80] and  xxxd3089xxx 
trial [81]) was charted against the reported weight gain
from this work (figure 3). as can be seen from the graph
(figure 3), whereas all placebo patients gained weight at an
average rate of 1% per week, weight gain in the  xxxd321xxx 
group did not occur after the first 2 weeks.
in summary, all evidence points to antagonism of the
 xxxg1078xxx  as the main mechanism for weight
gain in the use of sga. in lieu of the role of h1 antagonism
in sga’s induced weight gain,  xxxd321xxx  may be used as an
agent that prevents this phenomenon.

conclusions

 xxxd321xxx  as a drug has two special merits: an excellent
safety profile and unique pharmacological properties. these
merits have attracted researchers for decades with various
attempts to use this compound as an orally active,
cns-penetrating histamine analog.
expending knowledge on the physiologic role of histamine
as a neurotransmitter has revealed that it has a key role in
the regulation of weight. it is not surprising that some drug
companies are trying to develop an h3 antagonist as an
antiobesity agent [82,83]. although  xxxd321xxx  is a partial
antagonist for the h3 receptor, its capacity to directly
activates postsynaptic h1 receptors is the mechanism by
which it reduces food consumption. reports from animal
studies show that this compound reduces food consumption
in rodents and mammals. initial trials in humans have not
produced conclusive evidence that  xxxd321xxx  can be used
as an antiobesity agent, however, these studies showed a
positive signal. even if  xxxd321xxx  will not be shown to be
efficacious as an antiobesity agent for the general obese
subjects, it is still may be used to treat and prevent a special
type of obesity, the one associated with sgas.

expert opinion

frank greenway [84] beautifully summarized the current
state of obesity pharmacotherapy: ‘obesity drugs today appear
to be at the same place that hypertension medication was at in
the 1950s’. he noted that at that time the antihypertensive
drugs were not very efficacious, and their use was associated
with significant number of adverse events. with the
expansion of knowledge about the pathophysiology of

hypertension new drug classes and new and better
drugs emerged. furthermore, clinicians came to realize
that patients are managed better with drug combinations.
these drug combinations have several advantages over
monotherapy: they alter two physiologic pathways thus
preventing the compensatory response likely to occur
once one mechanism of action is disabled. they reduce
the rate of adverse events as the dosages used in these
combinations is usually lower than the one used in
monotherapy. finally, by ‘hitting’ two targets at once, they
increase the chances that the dominant pathway leading to
hypertension in that particular patient is taken care of.
obesity is a multifactorial disease, to which, no effective
treatment is available. current and future drugs (at least
those in advanced clinical trials), show on an average modest
weight loss. as many clinicians know, the average weight
loss reported for a drug is somewhat misleading, and some
patients respond well to the drug with significant weight
loss, whereas others do not. with new drugs that will enter

this field in the upcoming year, it is likely that we will be
able to find solutions to those patients that until now did
not respond well to available drugs. furthermore, similarly
to hypertension, drug companies have already started to
develop drug combinations. these combinations are based
on available drugs for other indications such as depression
and epilepsy, but they already show promising results.
in order for a drug to be a candidate for such a combination it has to have a good safety profile and a unique
mechanism of action.  xxxd321xxx  has both, and i believe
that it will find its way to the obesity market, either as a
monotherapy or as a part of a drug combination for the
management of obesity.
