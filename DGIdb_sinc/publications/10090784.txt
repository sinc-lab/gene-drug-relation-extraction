nineteen previously undescribed 2,4-diamino-6-(arylmethyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinazolines
(5a-m, 10-12) were synthesized as part of a larger effort to assess the therapeutic potential
of lipophilic  xxxg631xxx  (dhfr) inhibitors against opportunistic infections of aids.
condensation of appropriately substituted (arylmethyl)triphenylphosphoranes with 4,4ethylenedioxycyclohexanone, followed by hydrogenation (h2/pd-c) and acidolysis, yielded the
corresponding 4-(arylmethyl)cyclohexanones, which were then condensed with cyanoguanidine
to form the tetrahydroquinazolines. three simple 2,4-diamino-6-alkyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinazoline model compounds (9a-c) were also prepared in one step from commercially
available 4-alkylcyclohexanones by this method. enzyme inhibition assays against rat liver
dhfr, pneumocystis carinii dhfr, and the bifunctional dhfr-ts enzyme from toxoplasma
gondii were carried out, and the selectivity ratios ic50(rat)/ic50(p. carinii) and ic50(rat)/ic50(t. gondii) were compared. the three most potent inhibitors of p. carinii dhfr were the 2,5dimethoxybenzyl (5j), 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl (5k), and 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl (5l) analogues,
with ic50 values of 0.057, 0.10, and 0.091 µm, respectively. the remaining compounds generally
had ic50 values in the 0.1-1.0 µm range. however all the compounds were more potent against
the rat liver enzyme than the p. carinii enzyme and thus were nonselective. the t. gondii
enzyme was always more sensitive than the p. carinii enzyme, with most of the analogues
giving ic50 values of 0.01-0.1 µm. moderate 5-10-fold selectivity for t. gondii versus rat liver
dhfr was observed with five compounds, the best combination of potency and selectivity being
achieved with the 2-methoxybenzyl analogue 5d, which had an ic50 of 0.014 µm and a selectivity
ratio of 8.6. one compound (5l) was tested for antiproliferative activity against p. carinii
trophozoites in culture at a concentration of 10 µg/ml and was found to completely suppress
growth over 7 days. the suppressive effect of 5l was the same as that of trimethoprim (10
µg/ml) + sulfamethoxazole (250 µg/ml), a standard clinical combination for the treatment of
p. carinii pneumonia in aids patients. four compounds (5a,h,k,l) were tested against t. gondii
tachyzoites in culture and were found to have a potency (ic50 ) 0.1-0.5 µm) similar to that of
pyrimethamine (ic50 ) 0.69 µm), a standard clinical agent for the treatment of cerebral
toxoplasmosis in aids patients. compound 5h was also active against t. gondii infection in
mice when given qdx8 by peritoneal injection at doses ranging from 62.5 (initial dose) to 25
mg/kg. survival was prolonged to the same degree as with 25 mg/kg clindamycin, another
widely used drug against toxoplasmosis. three compounds (5j-l) were tested for antiproliferative activity against human tumor cells in culture. among the 25 cell lines in the national
cancer institute panel for which data were confirmed in two independent experiments, the
ic50 for at least two of these compounds was <10 µm against 17 cell lines (68%) and in the
0.1-1 µm range against 13 cell lines (52%). one compound (5j) had an ic50 of <0.01 µm against
four of the cell lines. the activity profiles of 5k,l were generally similar to that of 5j except
that there were no cells against which the ic50 was <0.01 µm.

these tetrahydroquinazolines is present in both tmp
and the anticancer drug  xxxd2968xxx  (6, ptx),5 which has
been reported to have potent antipneumocystis and
antitoxoplasma activity in the laboratory6a and has been
used to treat pcp in aids patients, with coadministration of  xxxd2462xxx  to prevent dose-limiting hematologic toxicity.6b thus the purpose of this study was to
assess the potency and selectivity of this series of ch2bridged analogues against p. carinii and t. gondii
dhfr and to test selected examples against intact p.
carinii and t. gondii organisms in culture. because ptx
has been used experimentally to treat cancer,7a,b it
was also of interest to test selected examples of 5 as
inhibitors of the growth of tumor cells in culture. it was
also of interest to compare the dhfr binding properties
of these compounds with those of 2,4-diamino-6-aralkyl5,6,7,8-tetrahydropyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidines 72c and 2,4diamino-6-(arylaminomethyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinazolines 8,8 two other recently studied series of dicyclic
small-molecule dhfr inhibitors with a saturated sixmembered b-ring. also synthesized during the present
work were the tetrahydroquinazolines 9-12, which
contain side chains other than benzyl.

chemistry
the synthesis of 6-substituted 2,4-diamino-5,6,7,8tetrahydroquinazolines was accomplished by condensing
cyanoguanidine (dicyandiamide) with an appropriately
substituted cyclohexanone as previously described.9 the
6-ethyl (9a), 6-tert-butyl (9b), and 6-phenyl (9c) analogues were obtained directly from the commercially
available ketones 13a-c (scheme 1).

rosowsky et al.

scheme 1

in the case of the other 6-substituted tetrahydroquinazolines, it was necessary to first develop a practical
route to 4-(arylmethyl)cyclohexanones. as shown in
scheme 2, variously substituted benzyl chlorides and
mesylates were heated with triphenylphosphine in
xylene solution to obtain the corresponding crystalline
phosphonium salts 14b-n. similarly, 2-(chloromethyl)thiophene and 3-(chloromethyl)thiophene were converted to 14o,p (scheme 2), and 2-(chloromethyl)furan
was converted to 14q (scheme 3).
when the required substituted benzyl chlorides were
not commercially available, they were prepared from the
corresponding alcohols and socl2 in toluene at room
temperature, and when the alcohols were not commercially available, they were prepared from the aldehydes with nabh4. when mesylates were used instead
of chlorides, they were obtained from the alcohols and
mscl/et3n. wittig reagents were generated in situ from
the phosphonium salts with dimsyl sodium (nah/
dmso) and were condensed with 4,4-(ethylenedioxy)cyclohexanone (15) to form the arylmethylene derivatives 16b-p (scheme 2) and the 2-furanylidene derivatives 16q (scheme 3). catalytic hydrogenation of 16bm,o,p in the presence of 10% pd-c and a trace of
glacial acoh afforded the arylmethyl derivatives 17bm,o,p with retention of the ketal group. although
catalytic hydrogenation of 16m occurred without loss
of the chlorine atoms, giving 17m, reduction of the
double bond in 16n with lialh4-cocl210 was found to
cause dehalogenation, giving 17a rather than 17n. thus
4-(chlorobenzyl)cyclohexanone and its cyanoguanidine
fusion product were not made (catalytic hydrogenation
of 16n would presumably have worked but was not
tried). reduction of the double bond in 16q was accompanied by reduction of the furan ring, yielding 17q
(scheme 3); accordingly, the rest of the sequence was
carried out with the furan ring in the tetrahydro form.
removal of the ketal blocking group from 17a-m,o-q
with hcl proceeded uneventfully, yielding the cyclohexanones 18a-m,o-q. fusion of the ketones with
cyanoguanidine at 180 °c completed the synthesis.
yields, melting points, and other physical constants of
the final products are summarized in table 1. all
compounds are presumably mixtures of 6r and 6s
enantiomers except the tetrahydrofuranyl analogue 12,
which is assumed to be a mixture of four diastereomers.
interestingly, when the ketal group was removed from
16f without first reducing the double bond and the
resulting ketone (19) was condensed directly with
cyanoguanidine (scheme 4) a product was obtained
whose 1h nmr spectrum was consistent with a 3:2
mixture of the e and z isomers of 2,4-diamino-6-(4methoxybenzylidene)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinazoline (20).
that the double bond was still in the exocyclic position
was suggested by the location of closely spaced vinyl
signals in the 1h nmr spectrum at delta 6.47, nearly the

same position as that of the vinyl proton in 19. if the
exocyclic double bond had suffered thermal rearrangement to form 2,4-diamino-6-(4-methoxybenzyl)-7,8-dihydroquinazoline, we would have expected an upfield
shift due to diamagnetic shielding by the 4-amino group.
 xxxg631xxx  inhibition
the ability of the tetrahydroquinazolines 5a-m, 9ac, and 10-12 to inhibit rat liver, p. carinii, and t.
gondii dhfr was determined by the standard spectrophotometric assay as described previously.11,12 the
results are shown in table 2, along with previously
reported data for trimethoprim (tmp, 4) and  xxxd2968xxx 
(ptx, 6) for comparison (see, for example, ref 2e). the
most potent tetrahydroquinazolines against the p. carinii enzyme were the 2,5-dimethoxy analogue 5j and the
3,4,5-trimethoxy analogue 5l. however these compounds
were also the best inhibitors of the mammalian enzyme,
and thus were nonselective. interestingly, 5j had roughly
the same potency as ptx, suggesting that reduction of
the b-ring is not detrimental to binding. it may be noted
that since the presumed mixture of 6r and 6s enanti-

omers was not resolved, their individual ic50 values
could not be determined. nonetheless, the fact that the
ic50 of 5j against each enzyme was consistently higher
than that of ptx suggests that one of the enantiomers
probably binds more tightly than the other.
compounds 5j,l were likewise among the best inhibitors of the t. gondii enzyme, with ic50 values of 0.021
and 0.024 µm, respectively. however, even though they
were more potent against this enzyme than against the
p. carinii enzyme, the difference was not great enough
to confer selectivity. several other compounds in the
series had about the same potency against t. gondii
dhfr as 5j,l, and two compounds, the 2-ch3o and
3-cf3o analogues 5d,h, were actually a little more
potent. in general, all the compounds were better
inhibitors of the t. gondii enzyme than of the p. carinii
enzyme, presumably reflecting more favorable contacts
between the substituted benzyl moiety and hydrophobic
residues in the active site.

was examined with reference to the unsubstituted

substituent at different positions. comparing the effect
of different meta substituents on binding to the t. gondii
enzyme, for example, the following order of potency was
noted: cf3o (5h) > ch3o (5e) > ch3 (5c) ≈ h (5a) >
cf3 (5g), suggesting that the cf3o group was favorable
for binding whereas the cf3 group was unfavorable. the
difference in ic50 between the most potent congener (5h,
0.014 µm) and the least potent (5g, 0.14 µm) was 10fold. comparing the effect of a particular substituent
(ch3o) at different positions on the phenyl ring, the
following order of potency against the t. gondii enzyme
was observed: 5d > 5e > 5f. the difference in potency
between 5d and 5f was 3.6-fold, suggesting that ortho
substitution was most favorable for binding. however

5d-f were equipotent against the mammalian enzyme,
suggesting that the effect of ortho substitution might
be species-related. when the effect of replacing the
phenyl ring with a bioisosteric thiophene ring was
compared, compounds 10 and 11 proved to be slightly
less potent than 5a against all three enzymes. when
the effect of deleting the ch2 bridge while retaining the
phenyl ring was examined (9c versus 5a), a dramatic
decrease in binding was observed against all three
enzymes, suggesting that a bridge of at least one atom
in length must be present for correct positioning of the
phenyl ring within the active site. an even larger
decrease in binding was observed when the benzyl group
was replaced by a less space-filling ethyl group (9a
versus 5a). however when the benzyl group was replaced by a tert-butyl group (9b versus 5a), there was

gondii enzyme. when the inhibition of p. carinii dhfr
by 5j was compared with that of the corresponding

76-fold. the potency of 5j,l was likewise increased
against the t. gondii and rat liver enzymes relative to
the corresponding  xxxd3047xxx [4,3-d]pyrimidines, but not to
the same degree. however, there was no improvement
in selectivity for the p. carinii enzyme and an actual
decrease in selectivity for the t. gondii enzyme. these
results reinforced our impression of a frequent inverse
relationship between potency and species selectivity
where inhibition of these enzymes by lipophilic antifolates is concerned.13

only a small difference in ic50, suggesting that an
aromatic ring in the side chain is not essential as long
as the hydrophobic 6-substituent is of sufficient bulk.
although the tetrahydroquinazolines 5a-m were
totally nonselective for p. carinii versus mammalian
dhfr, several of them did show moderate selectivity
for the t. gondii enzyme, the best among them being
5a,d,e,h, and 12, with a selectivity index in the 5-10fold range. compound 12 was notable in that its
heterocyclic side chain was fully saturated. the compound with the best combination of potency (0.014 µm)
and selectivity (8.6-fold) for this enzyme was the 2-ch3o
analogue 5d, which was almost as potent with ptx and
whose selectivity index was 100-fold higher. the presence of a 2-ch3o substituent in both 5d and ptx is
worth noting. while the potency of 5d against t. gondii
dhfr was nearly 200-fold greater than that of tmp,
its selectivity was unfortunately 5.6-fold lower. similarly the potency of 5d against the p. carinii enzyme
was 27-fold greater than that of tmp, but its selectivity
was 41-fold lower. thus our hope of matching the
potency of ptx with the selectivity of tmp against t.
gondii and p. carinii dhfr was not fulfilled in this
series.
it was of interest to compare the binding of selected
2,4-diamino-6-benzyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinazolines with
that of the 2,4-diamino-6-benzyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidines 21 and 222c and the 2,4-diamino6-(anilinomethyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinazolines 23 and
24,8 since all three ring systems contain a reduced
b-ring. as can be seen in table 3, substitution of a ch2
group for the ch2nh in 23 resulted in a 30-fold increase
in potency against p. carinii dhfr and smaller increases in potency against t. gondii and rat liver dhfr.
a similar effect was observed on substitution of a ch2
group by a ch2nh bridge in 24, in this case with an
increase in binding to p. carinii dhfr of 50-fold.
however, because binding to rat liver dhfr was also

activity against p. carinii and t. gondii
even though selective binding had not been achieved
in the binding assays using cell-free p. carinii or t.
gondii dhfr, it was of interest to test selected examples
of the 2,4-diamino-6-(arylmethyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinazolines against the intact organisms in culture. it
is well-known that p. carinii and t. gondii cells lack
an active transport system for exogenous folates.14 thus
the underlying assumption in the use of cytotoxic
lipophilic antifolates such as  xxxd2968xxx  or  xxxd3442xxx 
to treat p. carinii and t. gondii infections in aids
patients who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, firstline antiparasitic drugs is that hematologic toxicity can
be prevented by coadministration of a folate, which
would only be taken up by cells of the host. in the clinic
this is done with  xxxd2462xxx  (5-formyl- xxxd3334xxx ), whereas in tissue culture, the lung fibroblast
feeder cells that are required for cultivation of these
parasites are protected with  xxxd2146xxx , which is generally
present at micromolar concentrations in standard growth
media. the ability of several compounds to inhibit
proliferation of p. carinii trophozoites in culture was
assayed as previously described.15 in the case of t.
gondii a biochemical assay based on [3h]uracil incorporation by the tachyzoite form of the organism was
used.11
the results of an experiment comparing the effects
of 5l (10 µg/ml) and a standard combination of trimethoprim (tmp, 50 µg/ml) and sulfamethoxazole (smx,
250 µg/ml) on the growth of p. carinii trophozoites in
rat embryonic lung fibroblast short-term cultures are
shown in figure 1. the standard growth medium in
these assays contained  xxxd2146xxx  (10 µm) and was not
supplemented with  xxxd2462xxx . the average number of
trophozoites in the untreated cultures increased from
1-2 to 12 per microscopic field in 7 days, whereas

figure 1. suppression of the growth of p. carinii trophozoites
in culture by 5l (∆, 10 µg/ml) versus untreated controls (9)
or a combination of tmp+smx (0, 50 + 250 µg/ml). the
hollow symbols on days 0 and 1 are overlapped by the controls.

concentrations resulted in complete suppression of
trophozoite growth for up to 7 days with no sign of
toxicity to the mammalian host cells. control experiments showed that neither tmp nor smx alone retarded growth. some suppression of growth was noted
even when the concentration of 5l was decreased to 1
µg/ml (data not shown). the fact that 5l as a single
agent was as effective as the tmp+smx combination,
and was effective at a dose that was only one-fifth the
dose of tmp, suggested that this agent is taken up by
p. carinii and may be a useful alternative to the
standard tmp+smx regimen4 in patients who are
allergic to sulfa drugs.
four compounds (5a,h,k,l) were tested for their
ability to inhibit [3h]uracil incorporation by t. gondii
in cultures of human embryonic lung (hel) cells. the
assay is based on the fact that incorporation of uracil
into the nuclear dna of dividing mammalian cells is
very inefficient in comparison with that of t. gondii.11
the cultures were treated with different concentrations of drug for 24 h, after which [3h]uracil was added
and incubation was continued for another 24 h. as
shown in table 4, the ic50 values for the four compounds
tested were in the 0.1-0.5 µm range. the best compound of this group (5k, ic50 ) 0.081 µm) was 8.5-fold
more potent than pyrimethamine (ic50 ) 0.69 µm).
however it is of interest to note that the ratio [3h]uracil ic50/dhfr ic50, which has previously been
used as an indirect measure of relative uptake,11
was 3.5 as compared with 1.7 for pyrimethamine,
suggesting that uptake of 5h may be slightly less
efficient. by way of comparison, two other compounds
previously synthesized by us, 2,4-diamino-6-[(n-methyl3,4,5-trimethoxyanilino)methyl] xxxd3047xxx [3,2-d]pyrimi-

dine (25)2e and 2,4-diamino-6-[(2-bromo-3,4,5-trimethoxyanilino)methyl]quinazoline (26),2f gave ic50 values in the
same range as the tetrahydroquinazolines and thus are
assumed to also not be transported quite as well as
pyrimethamine. as noted elsewhere,11 increased efficacy
against the intact organism would presumably be
achieved with all these compounds by improving uptake
as well as dhfr binding.

compound 5h was also tested against t. gondii in
mice in a pilot dose-finding survival experiment. the
animals received a fairly high inoculum of 3 × 105
tachyzoites intraperitoneally on day 0, and intraperitoneal drug treatment was begun on day 1 and continued to day 8. to protect the mice from antifolate toxicity,
20-25 mg/kg  xxxd2462xxx  was also administered daily by
subcutaneous injection. the initially chosen dose of 5h,
62.5 mg/kg, appeared somewhat toxic and was therefore
decreased by 50% to 31 mg/kg on day 2, raised back to
50 mg/kg on day 3, and finally stabilized at 25 mg/kg.
as shown in figure 2, 9 of the 11 mice treated with 5h
survived to day 8, the last day of drug treatment,
whereas all the untreated controls died by day 6.
approximately one-half the mice treated with 5h were
still alive on day 14, but all the mice were dead by day
20. in a positive control experiment using clindamycin
at 31 mg/kg for the first 2 days, followed by a 20%
decrease to 25 mg/kg, the results were similar except
that two of the 10 mice in this group survived to day
20. thus, at least at the same dose, 5h and the clinically
used drug clindamycin16a prolonged the life of these
heavily infected animals to a comparable degree. al-

to 5j-l. four cell lines (km12, uacc-257, ovcar-8,
sn12c) appeared to be relatively resistant to 5j-l even
though they were sensitive (ic50 < 0.0.05 µm) to  xxxd3442xxx 
and mtx. interestingly, the bt-549 breast carcinoma
cell line, which was sensitive to  xxxd3442xxx  and resistant to
mtx, retained good sensitivity to 5j,k but was less
sensitive to 5l. against this cell line, therefore, 5j,k
resembled  xxxd3442xxx  whereas 5l was more like mtx. however the opposite was found with the ekvx cell line,
which was more sensitive to  xxxd3442xxx  than to mtx and
retained sensitivity to 5l but not to 5j,k. since lipophilic
antifolates do not depend on active transport via the
reduced folate carrier for their uptake into cells, differences in cytotoxicity between  xxxd3442xxx  and the individual
tetrahydoquinazolines 5j-l must be due to other factors.
summary
figure 2. suppression of the growth of t. gondii in mice by
5h +  xxxd2462xxx  (∆) versus controls (9) or clindamycin (0).
some of the hollow symbols on days 1-5 are overlapped by
the controls.

though 5h and clindamycin were not tested as a
combination, it is noteworthy that clindamycin has been
successfully combined with pyrimethamine as an antitoxoplasma regimen.16b
antitumor activity
the potent activity of compounds 5j-l against rat
liver dhfr suggested that these compounds would be
worthwhile to evaluate as inhibitors of the growth of
human cancer cells. to this end, 5j-l were submitted
to the national cancer institute for antitumor assay in
culture against a standard panel of cell lines.17 the
results of growth inhibition assays using a representative number of lines of different tissue origin are given
in table 5. data are given only for those cell lines whose
average ic50 from two reported experiments on different
days varied by no more than 0.5-fold of the range, or
were <0.01 µm in both experiments. thus, some cell
lines for which there were results for only a single
experiment are omitted. since the compounds were
tested as unresolved 6r,6s mixtures, each ic50 represents the composite effect of two individual enantiomers.
historical averages of many experiments performed at
the nci with the classical antifolate methotrexate
(mtx) and the nonclassical (lipophilic) antifolate  xxxd3442xxx  ( xxxd3442xxx ) are also included in table 5 for
comparison. among the 25 cell lines for which data
satisfying the criteria defined above were obtained, the
ic50 of at least two of the three compounds 5j-l was
found to be <10 µm against 17 cell lines (68%) and in
the 0.1-1 µm range against 13 cell lines (52%). one
compound (5j) was confirmed to have an ic50 of <0.01
µm against four of the cells (nci-460 and a549 lung,
hct-116 colon, mda-n breast carcinoma). the activity
profiles of 5k,l were similar to that of 5j except that
there were no cell lines against which the ic50 of these
compounds was <0.01 µm.
the potency of 5j-l against a number of the cell lines
was similar to that reported in the nci historical
database for  xxxd3442xxx  and mtx. three cells lines (ncih226, colo205, t- xxxd751xxx ) that were relatively insensitive
(ic50 > 1 µm) to  xxxd3442xxx  and mtx were also insensitive

a series of 25 previously unknown 2,4-diamino5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinazolines with hydrophobic aliphatic or aromatic substituents at the 6-position was
synthesized by reaction of cyanoguanidine with appropriately 4-substituted cyclohexanones. most of the
compounds were potent inhibitors of dhfr from p.
carinii, t. gondii, and rat liver, but none was selective
for the p. carinii enzyme and only a few were marginally
(<10-fold) selective for the t. gondii enzyme relative to
the mammalian enzyme. despite this lack of enzyme
selectivity, one member of the series (5l) was tested
against p. carinii in culture and was found to have an
antiproliferative effect comparable to the combination
of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (tmp+smx), a
standard clinical treatment for p. carinii pneumonia in
aids patients. four representative compounds (5a,h,k,l)
were tested in culture against t. gondii and were found
to have an effect similar to that of pyrimethamine; one
of them (5h) was also tested for activity against t.
gondii in mice and was found to be as potent and
effective as clindamycin. several compounds (5j-l) were
tested for antitumor activity in culture and were found
to be active at low micromolar or submicromolar concentrations, although they were generally less potent
than  xxxd3442xxx  or mtx.
experimental section
ir spectra were obtained on a perkin-elmer model 781
double-beam recording spectrophotometer. 1h nmr spectra
were recorded at 60 mhz on a varian model em360 spectrometer using me4si as the reference or at 500 mhz on a
varian vx500 instrument. tlc analyses were done on whatman mk6f silica gel plates, using 254-nm illumination to
visualize the spots. column chromatography was on baker
7024 flash silica gel (40-µm particle size). chemicals and
solvents for moisture-sensitive reactions were purchased from
aldrich. melting points were determined in pyrex capillary
tubes using a mel-temp apparatus (laboratory devices, inc.,
cambridge, ma) and are not corrected. elemental analyses
were performed by qti laboratories, whitehouse, nj, or
robertson laboratories, madison, nj, and were within (0.4%
of theoretical values unless otherwise indicated.

(4-methoxybenzyl)triphenylphosphonium methanesulfonate (14f). a stirred solution of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol
(10 g, 0.0727 mol) and et3n (14.6 g, 0.145 mol) in ch2cl2 (200
ml) was cooled in an ice bath and treated dropwise over 15
min with methanesulfonyl chloride (11.1 g, 0.0969 mol). when

addition was complete, the bath was removed and the reaction
was left to stir for 5 h. the reaction mixture was washed with
h2o (100 ml), and the organic layer was dried (na2so4) and
evaporated to obtain 4-methoxybenzyl methanesulfonate. the
crude product (9.50 g) was taken up directly in xylene (200
ml), and triphenylphosphine (12.7 g, 0.0484 mol) was added.
the reaction mixture was stirred under reflux for 2 days, then
cooled to room temperature, and filtered. the filter cake was
rinsed with xylene, and the combined organic layers were
evaporated to a solid, which was recrystallized from 1:1 chcl3

the following other (arylmethyl)triphenylphosphonium mesylate salts were prepared similarly and were confirmed to
be pure by tlc and by ir and 1h nmr spectroscopy:
2-methylbenzyl (14b), 72%, mp 257-258 °c; 3-methylbenzyl

stirring 0.72 g of nah (1.2 g of 60% oil dispersion, 0.03 mol)
in dmso (75 ml) at 60 °c under n2 for 1 h (until gas evolution
ceased). the solution was cooled to room temperature, and
phosphonium salt 14j (11.6 g, 0.026 mol) was added with
stirring. formation of the ylide was indicated by the development of a red color. after 10 min, 15 (4.06 g, 0.026 mol) was
added, and the reaction mixture was left to stir for 23 h and
then poured over ice. the mixture was thoroughly stirred with
petroleum ether (bp 30-60 °c), and the insoluble triphenylphosphine oxide was removed by filtration. the filter cake
was washed with petroleum ether and the wash solution added
to the original filtrate. the aqueous layer was separated and
extracted with petroleum ether, and all the organic layers were
combined and evaporated to an oil (7.22 g): tlc rf 0.4 (silica
gel, 4:1 hexanes-etoac). flash chromatography on silica gel

the following benzylidene derivatives were prepared similarly from the (arylmethyl)triphenylphosphonium chlorides
14g,k-n, and were purified by column chromatography on
silica gel as described above: 3-trifluoromethyl (16g), 34%, oil;
3,4-dimethoxy (16k), 12%, mp 103-105 °c (hexane); 3,4,5trimethoxy (16l), 61%, oil; 3,4-dichloro (16m), 68%, mp 6061 °c (meoh) (46-49 °c before recrystallization); 4-chloro
(16n), 61%, oil. in addition the following benzylidene derivatives were prepared via the mesylate salts 14b-f,h,i: 2-methyl
(16b), 100%, oil; 3-methyl (16c), 90%, oil; 2-methoxy (16d),
46%, oil; 3-methoxy (16e), 74%, oil; 4-methoxy (16f), 45%, oil;
3-trifluoromethoxy (16h), 78%, oil; 4-trifluoromethyl (16i),
26%, oil. the following heteroarylidene derivatives were also
prepared from 14o-q: 2-thienyl (16o), 17%, oil; 3-thienyl
(16p), 22%, oil; 2-furyl (16q), 28%, oil (unstable and therefore
reduced directly to a tetrahydrofuran as shown in scheme 3).
all the ylidene derivatives were tlc homogeneous, showed
the expected ir and 1h nmr features, and were used directly
for the next reaction. when the yield of product was low in
some cases, as in the synthesis 16o, a significant amount of
the starting phosphonium salt could be recovered from the
silica gel column as a slow-moving band.
4-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)cyclohexanone (18j). a solution of 16j (2.90 g, 0.01 mol) in meoh (75 ml) was stirred
with a small amount of sponge ni to remove traces of sulfur
impurities (remaining from the socl2 used for the synthesis
of 2,5-dimethoxybenzyl chloride). the ni was removed by
filtration, and the filtrate was treated with 2 drops of glacial
acoh and shaken with 5% pd/c (200 mg) under 3 atm of h2
for 20 h. the catalyst was removed, and the solvent was
evaporated. the crude product (17j) was stirred directly in a
mixture of thf (50 ml) and 2 m hcl (25 ml) at room
temperature for 20 h, the organic solvent was evaporated
under reduced pressure, and the product was partitioned
between etoac and h2o. evaporation of the organic layer and
vacuum distillation gave 18j as a colorless liquid: 2.03 g (82%);

the same general method was also used to prepare the
following 4-substituted cyclohexanones via ketals 17bm,o,p: 4-(2-methylbenzyl) (18b), 89%, oil; 4-(3-methylbenzyl)
(18c), 85%; 4-(3-methylbenzyl) (18c), 85%, oil; 4-(2-methoxybenzyl) (18d), 75%, mp 72-73 °c; 4-(3-methoxybenzyl) (18e),

°c; 4-(2-thienylmethyl) (18o), 68%, oil; 4-(3-thienylmethyl)
(18p), 67%, oil. except for the compounds that were distilled
(16g,k) or crystallized (16l) for microchemical analysis, the
ketones were purified to homogeneity by chromatography on
silica gel with 3:1 or 4:1 etoac-heptane as the eluent and
were used directly for the fusion reaction with cyanoguanidine.
4-benzylcyclohexanone (18a). a suspension of lialh4
(0.76 g, 20 mmol) in dry thf (40 ml) under n2 was cooled in
a dry ice-acetone bath and treated successively with 16n (2.43
g, 9.19 mmol) and anhydrous cocl2 (2.60 g, 20 mmol) as
described.10 the mixture, which turned black immediately, was
stirred and allowed to come to room temperature over 20 h.
the reaction was quenched with saturated aqueous na2so4
and diluted with et2o. the inorganic salts were removed by
filtration, the filter cake was washed thoroughly with et2o,
and the combined et2o filtrates were washed with h2o, dried
( xxxd2534xxx ), and evaporated to an oil whose 1h nmr spectrum
no longer showed a vinyl signal. the crude product (17a) was
taken up in a mixture of thf (20 ml) and 2 n hcl (10 ml)
and stirred at room temperature for 20 h. the thf was
evaporated, and the remainder was partitioned between
petroleum ether (bp 30-60 °c) and h2o. the organic layer
was evaporated and the residue distilled to obtain 18a as a
colorless liquid: 1.16 g (86%); bp 107-109 °c/0.07 torr; ir

anal. c, h. essentially complete dechlorination was confirmed
by combustion analysis, which showed only 0.22% chlorine.
4-(tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)cyclohexanone (18q). a mixture of 16q (0.560 g, 2.54 mmol) and 10% pd-c (2 g) in etoac
(150 ml) containing glacial acoh (2 ml) was shaken under
h2 (50 psi) in a parr apparatus for 1 day. the catalyst was
removed by filtration through celite, and the filtrate was
washed with h2o (2 × 30 ml) followed by 5% nahco3 (50
ml). drying (na2so4) and evaporation under reduced pressure
yielded 17q as a yellow oil (0.63 g). a 0.58-g portion of this oil
was dissolved directly in a mixture of thf (50 ml) and 2 n
hcl (14 ml), and after 1 day the solution was poured into 5%
nahco3 (200 ml). the product was extracted with etoac
(200 ml), and the solution was dried (na2so4) and evaporated.
chromatography of the residue on silica gel with 3:1 heptaneetoac as the eluent gave 18q as an oil pure enough for direct
use in the next reaction: 0.304 g (71%); ir (nacl) nu 2900, 2830,

(6r,6s)-2,4-diamino-6-benzyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinazoline (5a). a mixture of 18a (0.50 g, 2.66 mmol) and cyanoguanidine (0.216 g, 2.57 mmol) was stirred and heated at
180-190 °c in a round-bottom flask under a flow of n2 for
90 min. the reaction mixture was left to cool to room
temperature and taken up in a mixture of 85:15 chcl3-meoh
(200 ml). the solution was washed with h2o (100 ml), dried
over na2so4, and concentrated to dryness on a rotary evaporator. chromatography of the residue on silica gel with 85:15
chcl3-meoh as the eluent afforded 5a as a yellow solid
(0.331 g).
compounds 5a-m, 9a-c, and 10-12 were prepared very
similarly. the amount of ketone varied from 60 mg to 2 g, the
reaction temperature was kept at 180-200 °c, and the
reaction time was 80-90 min. silica gel chromatography was
performed with 85:15 or 9:1 chcl3-meoh as the eluent.
fractions were monitored by tlc on silica gel plates, using
the same solvent mixture, and those giving a single spot,
typically with rf 0.2-0.3, were pooled and evaporated. yields,
melting point values, and ir and 1h nmr spectral data for
the products are given in table 1. samples submitted for
elemental analysis were dried in vacuo overnight at room
temperature, but no other special effort was made to remove

final traces of chromatography solvents. as a result, most of
the compounds appeared to retain small fractional amounts
of organic solvent(s), a property of lipophilic antifolates we
have noted previously (reviewed in ref 2c). empirical c/n
ratios calculated from the microanalytical data were almost
always a little high but could be satisfactorily explained by
assuming the presence of trace amounts, typically <0.1 mol,
of chcl3 and/or meoh (i.e., the chromatography solvents). in
one instance (5l) the small number and upfield chemical shift
of the aryl protons actually made it possible to detect a singlet
at delta 7.3 whose peak height was consistent with a fractional
molar amount of chcl3 in the sample.
2,4-diamino-6-(4-methoxybenzylidine)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinazoline, e and z isomers (60:40 ratio) (20). a
mixture of 19 (400 mg, 1.87 mmol) and cyanoguanidine (156
mg, 1.87 mmol) was heated at 190-200 °c with stirring in a
round-bottomed flask under a flow of n2 for 90 m. a workup
procedure similar to that of the other cyanoguanidine reactions
gave a white solid: yield 130 mg (25%); mp 200 °c dec; ir
