abstract
the sensors applied recently for determination of cholinesterase activity are mostly enzymatic amperometric sensors, in spite of their disadvantages: short life-time at ambient temperature, instability of the response, interferences, as well as passivation of the electrode surface. in the
present paper a new approach for determination of cholinesterase activity was proposed, overcoming the main drawbacks of the analysis performed
with amperometric enzymatic sensors. instead of the immobilization of enzymes on a conducting electrode surface, whole cells of arthrobacter
globiformis, containing choline oxidase were fixed on a clark type oxygen probe. current proportional to bacteria respiration is registered as a
sensor response.
the application of whole cells of bacteria as a sensing element permits to achieve high stability of the response and long life-time of the sensor
at ambient temperature, due to the conservation of the enzyme in its natural micro-environment inside the immobilized cells. the proposed sensor
keeps its functionality more than 7 weeks stored in deionized water at ambient temperature. for the first 2 weeks the amplitude of the response
decreases with only 10% and at the end of the studied 7 weeks period the response was 50% of the initial.
the other advantages of the proposed sensor are: the dissolved oxygen is used as a mediator which concentration can be reliably and interferences
free measured by the aim of a clark type oxygen probe applied as a transducer; reproducible bacterial membranes can be elaborated by filtration
of resuspended bacterial culture after preliminary determination of its activity; application of membranes containing lyophilized bacteria capable
to be conserved infinitely long time and activated just before their application; negligible cost compared with the sensors based on immobilized
enzymes.
the steady-state response of the proposed bacterial sensor to choline obtained in 200 s is linear in the investigated concentration range up to
2 × 10−4 mol dm−3 , with detection limit of 8 × 10−8 mol dm−3 and sensitivity of 4 × 10−1 ␮a cm3 mol−1 , at ph 6, temperature of 25 ◦ c and stirring
rate of 300 rpm. choline is formed as a result of the catalytic hydrolysis (depending on the cholinesterase activity) of the substrate acetylcholine.
linear calibration graph for cholinesterase activity determination was obtained in the range up to 11 mu cm−3 , with a slope of
1.97 × 10−2 ␮a cm3 mu−1 , at ph 6, temperature of 25 ◦ c and stirring rate of 300 rpm.
the tests with reconstituted lyophilized serum with known activity used as a control sample confirm the accuracy of the proposed method. the
relative error of the determination was only 2.82%.

cholinesterase che (acylcholine-acylhydrolase  xxxg248xxx )
is one of the plasma’s enzymes. its activity in the blood serum
varies normally in the range of 1900–3800 u dm−3 (reference value, established using acetylthiocholine as a substrate)
(boshev, 1986). among the clinic states, associated with the

2

increase of the cholinesterase activity, an interest represents
the nephritis syndrome (podilchak, 1967). contrary, the lesions
of the liver’s parenchyma (cirrhosis, carcinomas, acute forms
of infectious and toxic hepatitis; podilchak, 1967), as well as
the phosphoro-organic compounds and the carbamates (insecticides, warfare agents and pharmaceutical products, which have
an inhibitory effect; podilchak, 1967), provoke a diminution of
the cholinesterase activity. consequently, the analytical evaluation of the cholinesterase activity has a clinico-diagnostic and
pharmaco-therapeutic importance, but represents also an interest
of agrochemical, ecological and military point of view, considering the impact of the anticholinesterase agents on men and the
environment.
the cholinesterase activity could be determined applying
various methods: spectrophotometric – of hestrin (1949) and
ellman et al. (1961), ph-metric (michel, 1949; nenner, 1970),
conductometric (hanss and rey, 1971), radiometric (gaballah,
1968; guilbault, 1970), fluorimetric (guilbault, 1970). in
the 60th years of the 20th century, the first cholinesterase
electrodes with an immobilized enzyme have been created
and bioelectrocatalytical methods have been introduced. these
methods have found an application mostly for the determination
of the cholinesterase inhibitors – by measuring the variation
of the enzymatic activity as a function of their concentration
(tran-minh, 1985; nikol’skaya and evtyugin, 1992; evtugin et
al., 1998 and recently doretti et al., 1999; stefan and van stade,

2005; solná et al., 2005; sotiropoulou et al., 2005; yang et al.,
2005). the features of the biosensors based on cholinesterases
for the determination of pesticides, developed the last decade
(until 2001–2003) are described, evaluated and discussed in
the review works of jaffrezic-renault (2001) and solé et al.
(2003a,b). a comparative presentation of the different types
of amperometric cholinesterase sensors developed during
the last 20 years (until 2002) is given by turdean et al.
(2002).
the cholinesterase electrodes, according to the applied electrochemical transducer can be potentiometric and amperometric.
the principles of their operation are summarized in the cited
above surveys (jaffrezic-renault, 2001; solé et al., 2003a,b;
turdean et al., 2002).
the potentiometric cholinesterase electrodes are based most
frequently on the following reaction:
che

r-choline + h2 o−→choline + r-cooh

(1)

the change of the ph of the solution as a result of the acid
formation during the enzyme catalyzed hydrolysis of the choline
esters is recorded, applying different techniques (fedosseeva et

al., 2000), as a sensor response depending on the cholinesterase
activity.
the amperometric cholinesterase electrodes providing faster
response, as well as higher sensitivity and accuracy than the
potentiometric ones are developed in two directions:
a. amperometric sensors based of the following bienzymatic
processes:
che

r-choline + h2 o−→choline + r-cooh
cho

choline + 2o2 + h2 o−→betaine + 2h2 o2

(2)
(3)

where cho is the choline oxidase.
the current of the h2 o2 oxidation or o2 reduction,
depending on the substrate concentration and the enzyme
activity, is recorded as a sensor response. however, since the
h2 o2 oxidation is carried out at a potential of +0.60 v/sce,
many substances contained in biological liquids and submitted to an oxidation at the same potential (glutathione, ascorbates, urates, etc.) interfere, corrupting the determination. as
shown by gunaratna the cholinesterase is very sensitive to its
micro-environment and even small changes provoke significant lost of enzyme activity resulting in decreasing of the
sensor sensitivity (gunaratna and wilson, 1990).
b. amperometric sensors based on synthetic substrates such as
thiocholine and indoxylacetate esters, transformed by the catalytic hydrolysis in products able to be easily oxidized. however, the anodic thiocholine oxidation provokes a passivation
of the platinum anodes, because of their interaction with
the sulfur containing compounds (nikol’skaya and evtyugin,
1992). the leucoindigo, product of the catalytic hydrolysis
of the indoxylacetate, is exposed to a chemical, as well as
to electrochemical oxidation involving o2 , which complicates the formation of the analytical signal (nikol’skaya and
evtyugin, 1992).
other essential disadvantages of the amperometric sensors
based on immobilized enzymes are the instability of the response
(solé et al., 2003a,b) and the short life-time at ambient temperature.
all these drawbacks of the immobilized cholinesterase electrodes could be successfully overcome applying a new approach
– measuring the respiration of whole cells of arthrobacter
globiformis employed as a sensing element immobilized on the
membrane of a clark type oxygen probe used as a transducer.
the functional principle of such a bacterial sensor is based on
the mentioned above bienzymatic processes (reactions 2 and 3).
reaction (3) takes place inside the immobilized bacterial cells
as a part of the natural cell metabolism. the enzyme choline oxidase included in the cells of the bacteria a. globiformis catalyzes
the oxidation of choline to betaine with oxygen consumption
(ikuta et al., 1977a,b; gadda, 2003). the diminution of the oxygen flow, passing trough the bacterial membrane and due to
the reaction (3) results in steady-state current diminution of the
clark oxygen probe.
the proposed approach permits to overcome the essential
disadvantages of the enzyme modified amperometric electrodes

m. stoytcheva et al. / biosensors and bioelectronics 22 (2006) 1–9

used recently for cholinesterase activity determination, namely
(solé et al., 2003a,b):
• diminution of the enzyme activity as a result of its microenvironmental changes. for the proposed sensor the enzyme
is stored inside the immobilized bacterial cells in its natural
microenvironment. that is why such a problem cannot exist
at all.
• occurring of concurrent electrochemical reactions at the
imposed electrode potential corrupting the determination.
• passivation of the eectrode surface.

3

the turbidimetric measurements of the bacterial culture were
performed using a spekol 11 spectrophotometer.
the determinations with amperometric registration were carried out in an especially elaborated cell. the clarck probe was
connected to a computerized potentiostat equipped with special
unit for noise suppression and appropriated software, produced
by zenit laboratory, bulgaria (zlatev, 2002).
all the measured concentrations were achieved by direct
addition of small volumes of solutions by means of biohit electronically adjustable pipettes.
2.2. bacterial culture

the unique electrochemical reaction taking place at the proposed sensor is the reduction of the oxygen occurring behind
the polymer membrane of the oxygen probe permeable for gases
only.
in addition, the proposed bacterial sensor provides the following advantages:
• stable sensor response, stored in deionized water at ambient
temperature (the diminution of its response is only 10% during
the first 2 weeks);
• using of dissolved oxygen as a mediator, providing reliable
measurement of its concentration by a clark type oxygen
probe applied as a transducer;
• easy preparation of sensors with reproducible characteristics.
by filtration of well-defined volume of resuspended bacterial
culture with preliminary determined activity, bacterial membranes with identical characteristics can be elaborated;
• membranes with lyophilized bacteria capable to be conserved
infinitely long time can be applied as sensing component. this
type of membranes can be activated just before the application, thus turning the clark oxygen probe into cholinesterase
activity sensor. the results obtained with lyophilized membranes are subject of the next paper;
• very low price of the sensor – neither procedures for enzyme
separation nor application of expensive already separated and
purified enzymes are needed.
2. experimental
2.1. reagents and apparatus
a. globiformis nbimcc 2369 were obtained from the
national bank of industrial microorganisms and cell cultures
(bulgaria).
acetylcholine chloride, choline chloride and cholinesterase
( xxxg248xxx , 13 u mg−1 ) were purchased from sigma. the substrates acetylcholine chloride and choline chloride, as well as
the other reagents were analytical reagent grade. fresh substrate
solutions were prepared daily. in order to maintain a constant
ph value, phosphate buffer solutions (ph 6–8), glycylglycine
buffer solutions (ph 8–9) and glycine buffer solutions (ph
9–11) were used. control human serum qualitrol hs n (merck,
2 u cm−3 at 25 ◦ c) was used as a standard for cholinesterase.
cellulose filters with pore size of 0.25 ␮m used for bacterial
membrane preparation were purchased from sartorius.

the bacterial strain a. globiformis, isolated and described by
conn and dimmick (1947) has been used. for its development,
the cultural medium proposed by ikuta et al. (1977a), containing 1% choline chloride, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% kcl, 0.1%
k2 hpo4 and 0.05%  xxxd2534xxx  ·7h2 o at ph 7, has been employed.
the bacterial culture has been filtered and centrifuged, in order
to obtain a mass of concentrated cells. the last has been resuspended in deionized water.
2.3. determination of the concentration of the bacterial
culture
the optical density od of the bacterial culture has been
measured turbidimetrically and the number of cells per cm3 –
by a direct microscopic count (brock and madigan, 1991). a
calibration plot expressing the relationship between these two
parameters has been constructed.
the turbidimetric measures have been based on lambert and
rayleigh laws. from the equations:
i = i0 e−tdelta
 
8pi  xxxd2756xxx  4 2
t=
nalpha
3
lambda

(4)
(5)

where i0 is the intensity of the incident light, i the intensity of
the light crossing a layer of thickness delta, delta the pathway length,
t the turbidity coefficient, lambda the wavelength, n the number of
dispersed particles (bacterial cells cm−3 in this case) and alpha is the
polarisability, it follows that the diminution of the light intensity
in the direction of its propagation in the micro-heterogeneous
bacterial culture would be the most important for the smaller
wavelengths. consequently, a maximal effect would be expected
in the area of the blue and the ultra violet light. however, as
the analytical signal was still enough important at 340 nm, the
turbidimetric measures have been carried out at this wavelength.
the standard plot is linear (od = 1.73n × 10−8 ;
2
r = 0.9857) in the investigated concentration range, up to
2.2 × 107 cells cm−3 . the relative error of the turbidimetric
determinations did not exceed 5%. the time of the analyses
was inferior to 1 min.
the turbidimetric method was preferred to the time consuming direct microscopic count, as well as to the wide spread
spectrophotometric method of lowry et al. (1951). the last characterizes with a relative error of the determinations varying from

4

m. stoytcheva et al. / biosensors and bioelectronics 22 (2006) 1–9

20% to 50%, time of execution about 90 min and a non-linear
standard curve. thereafter, only the express turbidimetric determinations have been applied for the determination of the cell
numbers per cm3 in the bacterial cultures, using the constructed
calibration plot.
the viability of the cell culture has been confirmed by the
standard method of koch (brock and madigan, 1991).
2.4. construction of the bacterial sensor
the bacterial sensor, subject of the present paper consists of
an oxygen probe used as a transducer and a bacterial membrane
used as a sensing element. in order to satisfy the specific requirements of the bacterial sensors, the oxygen probe was modified
in comparison to the commercial oxygen probes, as described
by zlatev et al. (2006a,b). first, the conventional spherical front
usually used in commercial clark oxygen probes was replaced
with a flat one, thus ensuring a good contact with the bacterial
membrane. second, the small disk cathode was substituted by a
gold multicathode uniformly dislocated on the whole surface of
the flat front. hence, the limitations due to the diffusion of the
o2 molecules from the periphery of the polymer membrane to
the cathode were eliminated.
the bacterial membrane consists of a thin layer of a. globiformis, covering a cellulose filter with pore dimensions preventing their loss, as well as the contamination of the bacterial
membrane with external bacteria. the bacterial layer was prepared by filtration of resuspended bacterial cells through the
cellulose filter. the bacterial membrane was fixed on the polymer membrane of the oxygen probe as shown in fig. 1, the
bacterial mass remaining confined between the polymer membrane and the cellulose filter.
to determine the volume of the filtered bacterial mass so that
membranes with reproducible activity to be obtained, the method
applied and describe earlier (zlatev et al., 2006a,b; zlatev, 2002)
was applied after preliminarily determination of the bacterial
culture concentration. this method allowed controlling the bacterial charge and hence the bacterial membrane activity by the
volume of the filtered bacterial culture.

3. results and discussion
3.1. response of the bacterial sensor to choline and its
characteristics
3.1.1. general considerations
in conformity to the eq. (3) the increasing of the choline concentration results in increasing of the a. globiformis respiration
i.e. increasing of the o2 consumption inside the bacterial membrane of the sensor. as a result the flow of the oxygen crossing the
entire bacterial layer and reaching the oxygen probe depends on
the choline concentration. thus, the changes of the steady state
current of the oxygen probe can be used as a measure of the
choline concentration.
on the other hand, accordingly to eq. (2), the quantity of the
generated choline resulting from the choline esters hydrolysis
(acetylcholine chloride in this case) catalyzed by cholinesterase
depends on the enzyme activity at identical conditions. consequently, the concentration of the generated choline can be used
as a measure of the cholinesterase activity.
taking this into consideration the response of the bacterial
sensor to choline was studied and the results are presented below.
all the determinations have been carried out at stirring rate of
300 rpm and temperature of 25 ◦ c. the temperature was held
constant because the following three parameters strongly affecting the sensor response depend on it:
• the response of the oxygen probe (about 2%/◦ c);
• the equilibrium concentration of the dissolved oxygen;
• the enzyme activity.
3.1.2. effect of ph
phosphate buffer with ph range from 6 to 8, glycylglycine
buffer with ph range from 8 to 9 and glycine buffer with ph
range from 9 to 11 were used as carrier solution. the effect of
ph on the sensor’s response (the change of the steady-state current of the oxygen probe) to a value about the middle of the
linear concentration range of choline (3.75 × 10−7 mol dm−3 )
is shown in fig. 2. the response of the sensor has a maximum
at ph value close to 8. this result shows that the choline oxidase contained in the immobilized cells of a. globiformis has its
maximal activity at the same ph value as the free enzyme (ikuta
et al., 1977b).
the cholinesterase activity is determined by measuring the
concentration of choline produced as a result of the enzymatic
hydrolysis (catalyzed by cholinesterase) of acetylcholine used
as a substrate. as shown by lautié et al. (1978) the acetylcholine
also undergoes an uncontrolled spontaneous hydrolysis, which
rate is ph depended. in order to decrease this non-enzymatic
hydrolysis, affecting the slope and the intercept of the calibration
curve, the determinations must be carried out at lowest possible
ph values. that is why the characteristics of the sensor to choline
was determined not at ph value close to 8 corresponding to the
maximum of the sensor response, but at ph 6 since the nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate is negligible at this ph
value (fig. 3).

stirring rate 300 rpm; temperature 25 ◦ c; constant choline chloride concentration of 3.75 × 10−7 mol dm−3 .

3.1.3. limit of detection (lod)
the limit of detection of choline chloride was experimentally determined to be 8 × 10−8 mol dm−3 . the response of the
bacterial sensor to this concentration, where the analytical signal equals to 3 r.s.d. is presented in fig. 4 (ph 6, 25 ◦ c,
300 rpm).
3.1.4. limit of quantitation (loq)
according to the upac definition (thévenot et al.,
1999), the lod can be calculated by the equation

8 × 10−8 mol dm−3 choline chloride (detection limit) at ph 6, temperature 25 ◦ c and stirring rate 300 rpm.

loq = 3.3 lod. the application of this equation yields:
loq = 2.6 × 10−7 mol dm−3 .
3.1.5. linear concentration range
the amperometric response of the sensor based on a. globiformis to choline chloride in the concentration range up to
1.2 × 10−5 mol dm−3 at ph 6, 25 ◦ c and 300 rpm is presented in
fig. 3. the corresponding calibration plot (steady-state current
is /␮a versus choline chloride concentration c/␮mol dm−3 ) is
linear, passes through the zero and it can be described by the
equation: is = 0.40c, with r2 = 0.9978. this equation is valid for
choline chloride concentrations up to 2 × 10−4 mol dm−3 .
3.1.6. sensitivity
the sensitivity s is the slope of the calibration curve within
the linear concentration range up to 2 × 10−4 mol dm−3 yields:
s = 0.4 ␮a ␮mol−1 determined by the equation given above.
3.1.7. steady-state response time
the steady-state biosensor’s response time was determined to
be 200 s for 10−5 mol dm−3 choline chloride concentration and
same experimental conditions, mentioned above. the steadystate response time increases with the increasing of the measured
choline chloride concentration and the bacterial charge of the
membrane.

for 12 consecutive injections of aliquots of 1 × 10−6 mol dm−3 each, at ph 6,
temperature 25 ◦ c and stirring rate 300 rpm.

3.1.8. storage life-time (tl10 and tl50 ):
for determining of this characteristic the biosensor based on
a. globiformis was stored in deionized water at ambient temperature and no stirring was applied. the response of the sensor
(the steady-state current) due to 10−5 mol dm−3 choline chloride was measured every day at 25 ◦ c, 300 rpm stirring rate and
ph 6. after 14 days of storage at ambient temperature about
10% loss of activity has been observed and after 49 days of

6

m. stoytcheva et al. / biosensors and bioelectronics 22 (2006) 1–9

storage at same conditions the sensor response was 50% of
the initial. thus, the storage life-time tl10 and tl50 were determined to be 14 and 49 days of storage, respectively, at ambient
temperature.
the results for the life-time obtained with the proposed bacterial sensor at ambient temperature could be explained with the
conservation of the natural microenvironment of the enzymes
included inside the bacterial cells during the storage of the bacterial sensor. the storage of all the immobilized enzyme based
sensors at ambient temperature always leads to rapid lost of the
enzyme activity due to the denaturizing of the enzymes that is
why they must be stored at 4 ◦ c.
3.1.9. selectivity
the unique agent interfering to the response of the proposed
bacterial sensor was found to be the glucose. the steady-state
response of the sensor to 10−5 mol dm−3 glucose was found to
be 4.7 times higher than that obtained for the same concentration
of choline chloride. as demonstrated by ikuta et al. (1977a) the
a. globiformis can be developed in choline containing media as
well as in glucose containing media. in spite that the bacterial
culture used for bacterial membrane preparation was developed
in choline containing media only, the glucose still continues to
take part in the bacteria metabolism. to avoid the influence of
glucose on the choline determinations the samples were preliminary treated by glucose oxidase used as catalyst for oxidation of
the glucose into gluconic acid – no affecting the determination
of choline.
3.1.10. sensors reproducibility
the reproducibility of the bacterial sensors based on a. globiformis was determined by a series of 10 averaged measurements
performed using each of the five identically elaborated membranes. the same bacterial culture was employed and measurements were carried out at ph 6, temperature 25 ◦ c and stirring
rate 300 rpm. the response of each of the five sensors corresponding to choline chloride concentration of 10−5 mol dm−3
was recorded after 1 h multiple rinsing of the sensor in deionized water, in order to remove the eventually included traces of
choline chloride in the bacterial membrane. the r.s.d. calculated from the obtained results was inferior to 3%.
3.2. cholinesterase activity determination
3.2.1. general considerations
the cholinesterase activity determination is based on measurement of the concentration of the choline chloride formed as
a result of the enzymatic (cholinesterase) hydrolysis of acetylcholine used as a substrate. that is why the basic characteristics
of the bacterial sensor versus cholinesterase activity are those
determined above for choline determination.
the native cholinesterase (ce 3.1.1.8) demonstrates a maximal catalytic activity at ph range 8.4–9 (kolev, 1976). the
maximal activity of the included in the immobilized cells of a.
globiformis choline oxidase (ec 1.1.3.17) was found to be at ph
about 8. however, experiments for cholinesterase activity determination have been performed at ph 6, in order to decrease the

chloride in the absence (curve 0) and in the presence of cholinesterase: curves

stirring rate 300 rpm).

spontaneous and uncontrolled non-enzymatic hydrolysis of the
substrate acetylcholine, as mentioned above.
3.2.2. sensor response
fig. 5 illustrates the amperometric response of the a. globiformis sensor to acetylcholine chloride. the substrate (acetylcholine) concentration was 2 × 10−5 mol dm−3 (ph 6, 25 ◦ c
and 300 rpm). the upper curve 0 corresponds to choline formed
as a result of spontaneous non-enzymatic hydrolysis occurring
during solution storage. the lower curves correspond to the formation of choline as a result of the enzymatic hydrolysis of the
acetylcholine, after consecutive cholinesterase additions.
3.2.3. linear concentration range
the corresponding to the curves in fig. 5 calibration plot
(steady-state current versus cholinesterase activity) is linear in
the investigated concentration range up to 11 mu cm−3 . the
slope of the line was found to be 1.97 × 10−2 ␮a cm3 mu−1 ,
the y-intercept was found to be 23.75 × 10−2 ␮a and linear correlation coefficient was 0.9971. the y-intercept corresponds to
the initial concentration of choline chloride resulting from the
non-enzymatic hydrolysis.
3.2.4. steady-state response time
since the determination of cholinesterase activity is based on
choline determination, the steady-state response time depends
on the response time of the sensor to choline and the rate
of the enzymatic hydrolysis. the experimentally determined
response time of the sensor to acetylcholine did not exceed
its response time to choline, as shown in figs. 3 and 5. that
could be explained taking into consideration the fact that the
cholinesterase has a very high turnover number and high specific activity, compared to choline oxidase (zubay, 1988). con-

chloride in the absence (curve 0) and in the presence of lyophilized serum (curve

sequently, the oxidation of choline inside the bacterial cells
catalyzed by the choline oxidase could be considered to be
the rate limiting process, in the absence of diffusion constraints, thus determining the response time of the bacterial
sensor.
3.2.5. selectivity
as shown above the glucose is the unique agent interfering
on the determination of the choline. since the determination of
the cholinesterase activity is based on the choline concentration
measurement, the glucose is the only interfering agent and it
must be eliminated as described above.
3.2.6. accuracy
determination of the cholinesterase activity of the reconstituted lyophilized serum qualitrol hs n with known activity was
performed in order to evaluate the accuracy of the method. the
response of the bacterial sensor to acetylcholine chloride (substrate concentration 2 × 10−5 mol dm−3 , ph 6, 25 ◦ c, 300 rpm)
before and after the serum addition is presented in fig. 6. a preliminary enzymatic catalytic oxidation of the glucose contained
in the serum was carried out, thus eliminating its interference.
the constructed calibration plot has been exploited for the verification of the results.
based on the experimental data, it has been found that the
cholinesterase activity in the diluted sample of lyophilized serum
is equal to 1.46 × 10−3 u cm−3 . the comparison of this result
with the calculated value (1.42 × 10−3 u cm−3 ) shows a relative
error of 2.82%.
4. conclusion
a new approach for determination of choline concentration
and cholinesterase activity based on the measurement of the

7

current due to bacteria respiration was proposed. this approach
was realized combining a clark type oxygen probe and a. globiformis bacterial membrane, resulting in a sensor with very
high stability of the response and long life-time at ambient
temperature, due to the storage of the enzyme inside the bacterial cells in its natural environment. the application of the
procedure for bacterial membrane preparation developed earlier permits to obtain sensors with reproducible characteristics.
the proposed approach allows avoiding the main disadvantageous of the enzymatic sensors – interferences, passivation of the
electrode surface, high price, etc. membranes with lyophilized
bacteria capable to be conserved infinitely long time without lost
of its activity could be applied as sensing component activated
just before the application.
the response of the biosensor was established in different
experimental conditions including measurements of real human
blood serum samples. the results obtained for cholinesterase
activity of the blood serum by the application of the proposed
sensor fit very well with the results obtained by other independent method.
