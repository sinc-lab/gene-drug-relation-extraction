abstract
an amperometric flow-injection choline biosensor was assembled utilizing natural chitinous membrane as the supporting material for biocatalyst
immobilization, and the membrane was purified from taiwanese soldier crab, mictyris brevidactylus. the chitinous membrane (<50.0 ␮m in
thickness) was covalently immobilized with choline oxidase ( xxxg248xxx .17 from alcaligenes sp.) and then attached onto the platinum electrode of
an amperometric flow cell. the flow cell served as the choline sensing device of the proposed fia system. the sensor signal (peak height of the
fiagram) was linearly related to choline concentration (r = 0.999 for choline up to 5.0 mm) with low detection limit (s/n > 3 for 10.0 ␮m choline)
and high reproducibility (cv < 3% for 1.0 mm choline, n = 7). the system was proved to be useful in measuring cholinesterase inhibitory activities
of synthetic chemicals or natural products.

1. introduction
inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase (ache) is a
general mechanism in developing cholinergic drugs and pesticides. reversible inhibitors have been used in treatment of
myasthenia gravis (e.g. neostigmine) and also alzheimer’s disease (e.g. tacrine) [1–4]; the more toxic irreversible inhibitors
such as organophosphates or carbamates are the major group of
agricultural insecticides [5]. therefore, analytical methods for
detecting or characterizing anti-ache activity are demanded in
biomedical industries and also for public hygiene.
however, both the enzymatic products of ache, choline
and acetate, are optically and electrochemically inert for
conventional chemical analysis [6–9], biosensor approaches
were therefore considered [10]. lacking proper analytical
enzyme, acetate sensors [11,12] required multiple enzyme reactions, which complicated the sensor designs and the practical

applications. most biosensors for ache inhibitory test were
therefore based on immobilizing a stable and specific analytical enzyme from alcaligenes sp., choline oxidase (chox;
ec 1.1.3.17). with a durable and electrochemically inactive
supporting material for enzyme immobilization, one can easily assemble an electrochemical anti-ache sensor based on
chox.
chitinous materials (chitin and chitosan) are versatile in
biomedical areas; the additional amino groups on their surface
render the biomaterials a promising support for enzyme immobilization [13]. most chitin and chitosan-based biosensors used
reconstructed membrane cast with purified materials [14–19],
but the mechanical characters are not satisfactory for longterm usage. in our recent studies, natural chitinous membranes
from taiwanese soldier crabs (mictyris brevidactylus, stimpson,
1858) were used for biosensor construction [20]. the natural
membranes are chemically stable and mechanically tough, the
amino group densities on the membrane surface are also sufficient for effective ligand-binding. the membrane itself is a
physical barrier to prevent unwanted molecular attachments on
the sensing electrode; the positively charged amino groups can

either repel cationic interfering chemicals or pre-concentrate
anionic analytes [21].
in the present approach, chox (ec 1.1.3.17) was immobilized on the natural chitinous membrane, and the resulting
bioactive membrane was used to assemble an amperometric
flow-injection choline biosensor. the choline sensing system
was proven to be a fast and reliable tool for assessing the ache
inhibitory activities.
2. experimental
2.1. chemicals, enzymes and food extracts
hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, acetone and phosphoric acid (85%, w/v) were purchased from union chemical,
taiwan. glutaraldehyde solution (25%, w/v),  xxxd2298xxx  (30%, w/v) and ascorbate were from nacalai tesque,
japan. choline chloride, acetylcholine chloride and neostigmine bromide were purchased from wako pure chemical. other
chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received.
choline oxidase (ec 1.1.3.17 from alcaligenes sp., 13 u/mg
solid) and acetylcholinesterase ( xxxg38xxx . from bovine erythrocyte, 2.4 u/mg solid) were from wako pure chemical,
japan. the enzymes were stored at −20 ◦ c.
dried and chopped samples of ginkgo ( xxxd2199xxx )
leaves, grape (vitis coignetiae) leaves, tea (camellia sinensis)
leaves and nelli (phyllanthus embelica) fruits were homogenized and extracted for 12 h with methanol under mild stirring
condition. the resulting suspensions were centrifuged, and the
supernatants were freeze-dried to obtain water soluble powders. the extract powders were diluted with 0.2 m phosphate
buffer (ph 8.0) for analysis. deionized water with conductivity
less than 1.0 ␮s/cm was used for sample dilution and reagent
preparation.
2.2. preparation of chitinous membranes
taiwanese soldier crabs with carapaces of approximately
15.0 mm in diameter were collected from the intertidal sandy
flats at hsin-chu, taiwan and stored at −20 ◦ c until use. chitinous membranes, the exoskeletons of the crabs, were purified
directly by a sequence of acid/base treatments [20,21] without dissection. the membranes for biosensing purposes were
cut from the carapace parts for suitable size (12 mm × 8.0 mm,
fig. 1). the chitinous materials were stored in deionized water
of 4 ◦ c until use.
the thickness of purified chitinous membrane was measured using a micron micrometer (no. 293-561 n, mitutoyo,
japan) fitted with a ratchet stop. before the measurements, the
membrane was rinsed with deionized water to ensure sufficient
swelling of the biopolymer. the tensile strength and elongation of the chitinous membrane were mainly evaluated with a
mechanical testing system (model 4400, instron co., usa) and
its modularized method, astm- xxxd882xxx  [22]. all testing specimens were cut into standard strips (9.0 mm length, 7.0 mm
width) for normalization and measured at ambient temperature.

are the membrane of the carapace part and a coin of 20 mm in diameter.

2.3. enzyme immobilization
prior to the experiment, alkaline glutaraldehyde solution (5%,
v/v) was prepared by mixing 1.0 ml of 25% aqueous glutaraldehyde with 4.0 ml of carbonate buffer (0.2 m, ph 10.0).
chitinous membranes from the crabs’ carapaces were immersed
in the alkaline glutaraldehyde solution for ca. 2 h to activate the
surface amino groups. after being rinsed with deionized water,
the glutaraldehyde-treated chitinous membrane was immersed
into enzyme solution (0.1 mg choline oxidase in 1.0 ml of 0.2 m
phosphate buffer, ph 7.0) and kept at 4 ◦ c for 16 h. the chitinous enzyme membrane was then rinsed with the mentioned
phosphate buffer and stored at 4 ◦ c until use.
2.4. amperometric ﬂow cell
the flow cell was composed of two resin blocks separated
by a silicon septum (1.0 mm in thickness); these components
were hold securely together by bolts and nuts (fig. 2). on the
surface of resin block b inlayed the platinum working electrode
(14.0 mm2 ). resin block a contains pathways (inlet and outlet,
dotted line) for the carrier stream and a socket for ag/agcl reference electrode (re-3v, bas). the stainless outlet-pipe (1.0 mm
i.d. tube for hplc) served as the counter electrode for three-

through the oval opening (80 mm width and 150 mm length, as
the electrochemical reaction chamber) of the silicon septum.
2.5. flow-injection analytical system
the assembled electrochemical biosensing flow cell was
incorporated into a flow-injection manifold (fig. 3). with a
controllable peristaltic pump (micro tube pump-mp3, eyela),
carrier solution (0.2 m phosphate buffer, ph 8.0) was continuously driven (typically, 1.5 ml/min) through a low pressure
injection valve (model 5020, rheodyne) and then the flow
cell. sample solution was introduced into the carrier stream via
the sample loop (ca. 20.0 ␮l) of the injection valve. amperometric signal (0.6 v versus ag/agcl) was continuously monitored
with a home-made potentiostat and a chart-pen recorder (r-50
series, rikadenki).

2.6. ache inhibition ratio
all enzymes or chemicals were dissolved or diluted with
0.2 m, ph 8.0 phosphate buffer. as summarized in table 1, different volumes of ache (1.0 u/ml), the inhibitors, phosphate
buffer and acetylcholine solutions (15.0 mm) were added into
four different test tubes. after the two-stage 37 ◦ c incubation to
complete the reactions, the sensor responses of the four experimental groups (inhibition group, control group, blank 1 and
blank 2) were used to calculate the inhibition ratio i%, eq. (1):
i=

(ictrl −  xxxg1371xxx  ) − (iinhi − ib2 )
× 100%
ictrl −  xxxg1371xxx

where ictrl is the peak current of control group,  xxxg1371xxx  the peak
current of blank 1 group, iinhi the peak current of inhibition
group and ib2 is the peak current of blank 2 group.

clear chitinous membranes of at least 20 crabs were simultaneously obtained after the acid and alkaline treatment for
approximately 3 days. details about the results of membrane
purification process were similar to the previous investigation
[20]. typically, about 30 mg of chitinous skin (membrane) was
purified from a crab with carapace of ca. 15.0 mm in diameter;
the deacetylation degrees were calculated spectrophotometrically to be around 25% [23]. the membranes were stable in
alkaline, acidic and even organic medium (e.g. acetone used in
removing the red pigments on the walking legs).
membranes cut from the dorsal carapaces were measured
to be less than 50 ␮m in thickness (20–50 ␮m for 20 crabs).
the tensile strength of chitinous membrane (54.6 ± 3.3 kg/mm2 ,
n = 5) was higher than parafilm® (43.1 ± 1.7 kg/mm2 , n = 5).
the natural membrane is thinner than the laboratory-use thin
film (parafilm® , 120 ␮m in thickness), but with an even stronger
mechanical strength. however, the breaking elongation of chitinous membrane (127.3 ± 4.6%, n = 5) was somewhat less than
parafilm® (378.1 ± 32.3%, n = 5). with the excellent mechanical
properties, the thin elastic biomembranes can be easily handled
and fit onto the sensing surface of a biosensor.
the electrochemical properties of this hydrophilic membrane
were characterized in a previous report [21].

ascorbate was thought to be the most problematic interfering chemical in electrochemical bioanalysis. the amperometric
flow-injection signals (0.6 v versus ag/agcl) of ascorbate were
measured with a bare platinum electrode and also with the
same electrode covered with the natural chitinous membrane.
the results were compared with the responses of h2 o2 as in
fig. 4. as judged from the slopes of these calibration curves,
the diffusion of h2 o2 was somewhat tempered by the natural membrane, which led to a 60% decrease in sensitivity. the
diffusion restriction effect of the positively charged chitinous
membrane is more obvious for the negatively charged molecule,
ascorbate.
3.3. effect of ionic strength on selectivity
with increasing ionic strength of carrier solution, the ionic
atmosphere of negatively charged ascorbate molecules will
expand due to electrostatic shielding effect of counterions from
background solution. therefore, the transportation of ascorbate
molecules through the positively charged chitinous membrane is
expected to be slower in environment with higher ionic strength.
compared with the responses of h2 o2 , the amperometric signals
of ascorbate obtained with the electrode covered with chitinous membrane significantly decreased as buffer concentration
exceeded 0.2 m (fig. 5). this leaded to a significant decrease in
signal ratios at higher ionic strength. considering both the sen-

3.4. dose-dependent biosensor responses
along with the carrier flow, injected segments (20.0 ␮l) of
sample solution were delivered into the electrochemical flow
cell with the chitinous membrane immobilized with choline oxidase (chox). choline was oxidized rapidly by dissolved oxygen
on the outer surface of the chitinous membrane. the evolved
 xxxd2298xxx  diffused through the chitinous membrane and
finally reached the positively polarized (0.6 v versus ag/agcl)
platinum electrode:

trochemical bioanalytical system. oxidative currents of h2 o2
were monitored, and typical fiagrams were recorded. the
sample throughput was higher than 20 determinations per h
when carrier flow rate was set at 1.5 ml/min. the calibration
curve for choline passes through the origin with good linearity (r2 = 0.9993), which allows one-point calibration for rapid
analysis. the linearity was up to 5.0 mm, and the s/n ratio of
the signals from 10.0 ␮m choline was higher than 3. the relative standard deviations (n = 7) for determination of 1.0 mm
choline was less than 3%. the electrochemical choline sensitivity of the fia system was calculated to be 14.2 na/␮m cm2 . the
high sensitivity persisted for months, the decrease in sensitivity
was less than 10% after two months of daily usage (data not
shown).

the ph dependency of the sensor response was studied with

with the aforementioned biosensing system, the tabulated protocol (table 1) and eq. (1), the dose-dependent inhibition curve of
a chemical can be obtained and its ic50 can be estimated. typical sigmoid inhibition curves of neostigmine were obtained with
initial acetylcholine concentration higher than 1.67 mm (fig. 7),
5.0 mm acetylcholine was used thereafter for ic50 measurement.
the estimated ic50 (500 nm from fig. 7) is comparable with a
documented result [25].

3.8. screening anti-ache components from natural
materials
the methanolic extracts of four plants were found to possess ache inhibitory activities (table 2). the extracts were
diluted with phosphate buffer (0.2 m, ph 8.0) to different
extents to obtain the inhibition ratios. the extracts of tea
leaves and nelli fruits may contain residual esterase with
acetylcholine hydrolyzing activity, the differences in  xxxg1371xxx  and
ib2 are therefore not negligible as compared with that of
ginkgo leaves extract and grape leaves extract. judging from
the approximate ic50 , ginkgo leaves seems to be the most
pharmacologically potent food stuff for developing medicine
or nutraceuticals. further purification procedures should be
undertaken to identify the active ingredients in these materials.

4. discussion
although most biosensors [26–28] for anti-ache test were
constructed by co-immobilizing ache and chox on their sensing devices, the denaturation of ache during immobilization
process or after the reaction with inhibitors led to a lower sensitivity or even false results especially after repetitive tests. using
free ache and with choline oxidase immobilized were thus suggested [29–32], this study provided also a practical protocol for
calculating inhibition ratios.
choline oxidase from alcaligenes sp. is stable and specific for
analytical purposes. unlike the other commercialized enzymes
such as those from arthrobacter globiformis, the enzyme is
free from product inhibition, other similar compounds such as
glycine or betaine aldehyde will not alter the enzymatic reaction.
the analytical enzyme was immobilized on the surface of an
ideal supporting material, the chitinous membrane from soldier
crab; the performances of our system are therefore expected.
the dynamic range and reproducibility of the proposed sensing system are generally higher than the documented choline
sensors [33–37]; the detection limit is comparable with the most
recent approaches using electrodes modified with prussian blue
[38] or even carbon nanotube [39,40]. the outstanding durability [20] further expands its practical use. possible applications
[41] such as screening cholinergic or anti-alzheimer chemicals,
detecting residual pesticides in agricultural products and also
diagnosing abnormality in liver functions are under investigations.
