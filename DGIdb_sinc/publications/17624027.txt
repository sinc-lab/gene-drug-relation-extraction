abstract
 xxxd2645xxx  (zavescatm) is a reversible inhibitor of  xxxg2376xxx , which catalyses the first
step in the glucosylceramide biosynthetic pathway, and is approved for therapy in patients with type 1
gaucher disease. the present report describes the pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd2645xxx  in the rat with a
focus on tissue distribution. experiments were performed with radiolabeled  xxxd2645xxx  itself and with a
perbutyrated prodrug, the latter being readily converted to  xxxd2645xxx  during gastrointestinal absorption
and first pass metabolism.  xxxd2645xxx  was well absorbed and exhibited an oral bioavailability of
40–60%. tissue distribution studies indicated the presence of  xxxd2645xxx  in a number of organs and
tissues that are considered of importance for the long-term therapeutic benefit, in particular the central
nervous system, bone and lung.  xxxd2645xxx  was eliminated via renal clearance by a combination of
glomerular filtration and active secretion. hepatic clearance was negligible, as was the role of
metabolism in the overall elimination process of  xxxd2645xxx  in the rat.

introduction
gaucher disease (gd) is a clinically and pathologically heterogeneous lysosomal storage
disorder whose clinical manifestations result from complex metabolic disturbances and
cellular responses to the accumulation of substrate, mainly glucosylceramide (beutler 2006).
therapeutic approaches to the disease need to address the accumulation of glucocerebroside
in the cells of various organs. gd is well recognized as a systemic disorder, with multiple
manifestations ranging from hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia and anemia to longterm complications and involvement of other organs, such as the skeleton, the lungs and
the central nervous system (cns). type 1 gd, by far the most frequent disease form,
has been conventionally distinguished by the absence of a primary cns involvement.

 xxxd2645xxx  tissue distribution in the rat

however, recent reports of an increased incidence of peripheral and central nervous system
abnormalities prompt the need to think of gd as a ‘continuum’ (pastores et al. 2003;
mercimek-mahmutoglu 2004; accardo et al. 2005; elstein et al. 2005; perretti et al. 2005;
sidransky 2005).
enzyme replacement therapy (ert) represents an effective therapy for organomegaly and
hematological abnormalities (beutler 2004). however, ert effectiveness in controlling
bone disease is suboptimal, most likely as a consequence of insufficient distribution to bone
tissue (beutler et al. 1995; schiffmann et al. 2002; rudzki et al. 2003; lebel et al. 2004;
mankin et al. 2006). moreover, the enzyme is unable to cross the blood–brain barrier and
to avert cns manifestations.
 xxxd2645xxx  is a reversible inhibitor of  xxxg2376xxx , the enzyme that catalyses
the first committed step in the glycosphingolipid (gsl) biosynthetic pathway (platt et al.
2003). consequently,  xxxd2645xxx  has the potential to treat multiple gsl storage diseases.
the efficacy of  xxxd2645xxx  has been demonstrated in cellular and animal models, including
those with cns involvement (priestman et al. 2000; butters et al. 2005), and substrate
reduction therapy with  xxxd2645xxx  has been established in clinical trials as effective treatment
in mild to moderate type 1 gd (cox et al. 2000; zimran and elstein 2003; elstein et al.
2004; pastores et al. 2005).
this is the first publication reviewing the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of
 xxxd2645xxx  in rats and also includes a number of experiments performed with the perbutyrated
analogue of  xxxd2645xxx . development of this prodrug was considered at one point with the
goal of trying to circumvent the mild diarrhea observed after  xxxd2645xxx  administration.
however, this concept was abandoned later. as evidenced by a combination of in vivo
and in vitro experiments, the perbutyrated prodrug is quantitatively cleaved to  xxxd2645xxx 
upon oral absorption and first-pass metabolism. the pharmacokinetic and tissue
distribution data presented here therefore reflect the properties of  xxxd2645xxx  itself.

materials and methods
test articles and dosage forms
the [14c]-labeled perbutyrated prodrug and [3h]-labeled  xxxd2645xxx  (for chemical structures
see figure 1) were provided by the radiochemistry group of the searle & co. drug
metabolism department (research and development division, g. d. searle & co., skokie,
il, usa). lot numbers gds 765-4, gds 765-5 and gds 2081-70 of the [14c]-prodrug
with specific activities of 0.949, 0.518 and 0.962 mci/mg, respectively, and radiochemical
purities in excess of 99.5% were used for the in vivo studies. [14c]-prodrug was
radiochemically diluted with unlabeled prodrug (chemical purity >95%) to attain the
desired specific activities. for the in vitro studies with [14c]-prodrug, lot gds 2081-127a
with a specific activity of 19.1 mci/mg and a radiochemical purity of 97% was used.
[14c]- xxxd2645xxx  (batch no. cfq 11955) was supplied by nycomed amersham plc
(buckinghamshire, england) with a radiochemical purity of 98.1%. three batches
of tritiated [3h]- xxxd2645xxx  (mrc-627-56, mrc-627-239 and mrc 627-269; research
and development division, g. d. searle & co., skokie, il, usa) with specific activities of
5.93, 7.62 and 20.9 mci/mg, respectively, and radiochemical purities from 95.3% to 99.7%
were used. the desired specific activity was obtained by mixing [3h]- xxxd2645xxx  with
unlabeled drug in the appropriate proportions. for animal experiments, the prodrug
was formulated as aqueous suspension in 0.5%  xxxd2609xxx  containing 0.1% polysorbate

animal experiments
tissue distribution studies. the tissue distribution of  xxxd2645xxx  was studied after oral
administration of the [14c]-prodrug ( batch gds–2081–70) at a dose of 137 mg/kg
(equivalent to 60 mg/kg of  xxxd2645xxx ) to male long-evans hooded rats with a body weight
range of 244–277 g. after overnight fasting, rats were dosed orally by gavage. groups of
three rats were sacrificed by exsanguination after  xxxd2052xxx  anesthesia at 1, 4, 8, 24 and
72 h post-dose. heparinized plasma, red blood cells, urine, feces, different tissues and
organs were collected and frozen at 20 c pending analysis. the samples were measured
for total radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting following sample preparation as
described below. samples of red blood cells, eye, eye lens and blended feces were dried
in combustocones (packard instruments co., downers grove, il, usa) at room
temperature for at least 15 h and oxidized using the tri-carb sample oxidizer model 306
(packard instruments co., downers grove, il). the 14co2 generated was collected
by absorption in carbosorbõ (8 ml) to which permafluorõ eþ scintillation fluid (10 ml) was
added. combustion efficiency was determined by using spec-chec-14c standards for
sample oxidisers from perkin elmer. prior to combustion, feces samples were mixed with
one weight equivalent of methanol/carbopol (50/50; v/v) in a blender (lab-blender 80,
a. j. seward, london, uk) and thoroughly homogenized. urinary bladder, adrenal glands
and tissue homogenates were solubilized whole or as aliquots in 1.5 ml soluene 350
(packard instruments co.) overnight and total radioactivity quantified by liquid scintillation
counting after addition of 10 ml hionic-fluor (packard instruments co.). tissue
homogenization was achieved using the brinkman polytron (system technik ag,
rüschlikon, switzerland) after addition of a known volume of water.
pharmacokinetic studies. male or female sprague-dawley rats (charles river breeding
laboratory, canada or wiga, germany) received [14c]-prodrug (lots gds 765-4 or
gds 765-5 with specific activities of 0.474 and 0.259 mci/mmol, respectively, while lot

765-5a was used in the portal vein study) after overnight fasting at a dose of 137 mg/kg
formulated as an oral suspension in 0.5%  xxxd2609xxx . blood samples (ca. 0.5 ml) were
taken from the retro-orbital plexus or tail vein at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h post-dosing. a
second pharmacokinetic study was performed with [3h]- xxxd2645xxx  at an intravenous bolus
dose of 160 mg/kg, and at oral doses of 60 and 160 mg/kg with dosing volumes of 1.5 and
10 ml/kg, respectively. food was available to the rats ad libitum throughout the study. blood
samples were taken at 0.08, 0.25, 0.75, 1.5, 3, 6, 8 and 24 h after i.v. dosing, at 0.25, 0.5,
1, 4 and 8 h after oral dosing at 60 mg/kg, and at 0.08, 0.16, 0.33, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h
after oral dosing at 160 mg/kg. blood samples were collected into chilled li-heparin
vacutainers containing 30 ml of 10% diethyl-p-nitro- xxxd2915xxx  in ethanol as esterase
inhibitor. plasma was generated by centrifugation at approximately 3000 g for 15 min at 4 c
and was immediately frozen. urine and feces samples were collected up to 72 h post-dosing
in containers cooled by dry ice. the urine, feces and plasma samples were stored at 20 c
until analysis.
plasma samples (0.3 ml) from the experiments with radiolabeled prodrug were loaded
onto c-18 bond eluttm columns (1 ml, analytichem international inc., harbor city, ca,
usa) preconditioned with 2 ml each of methanol and water. the columns were first washed
with 2 ml of water and radioactivity then eluted with 0.5 ml of a 10/90 (v/v) mixture
composed of aqueous 0.02 m heptane sulfonic acid/0.01 m sodium phosphate ( ph 4.5) and
methanol. the organic fraction was removed under a stream of nitrogen, the residue
reconstituted in 0.5 ml of a mixture containing 0.02 m aqueous heptane sulfonic
acid/0.01 m aqueous sodium phosphate (ph 4.5) and methanol (50/50; v/v), and the
sampled submitted to hplc analysis. urine samples were centrifuged and injected
onto the hplc column without further work-up. plasma samples (30–100 ml) from the
experiments with [3h]- xxxd2645xxx  were applied to a c18 bond eluttm cartridge
(analytichem international inc., harbor city, ca) preconditioned with 2 ml of methanol,
1 ml of 0.1 m naoh, followed by 2 ml of distilled water. cartridges were then washed with
1 ml of distilled water and the analyte eluted with 2 ml of methanol. fractions containing
non-volatile tritium were evaporated to dryness and stored at 20 c pending analysis.
separate aliquots of these fractions were used for the recording of radiochromatograms
and recovery determination.
stability of the radiolabel was additionally studied by quantifying the volatile portion of
radioactivity in the plasma samples. tritiated water was removed as a toluene azeotrope
using a dean stark apparatus and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. non-volatile
tritium in both urine and plasma samples was determined by freezing additional duplicate
aliquots (30 or 100 ml) of each sample followed by lyophilization ( virtis, model 10–mrsa,
research equipment, gardiner, ny, usa) of the samples for a minimum of 12 h.
the residues were reconstituted in distilled water (30 or 100 ml) and the non-volatile tritium
determined by liquid scintillation counting. control urine and plasma samples containing
known amounts of added [3h]- xxxd2645xxx  were stored and profiled by hplc in the same
manner as the study samples to insure stability of the compound throughout storage,
lyophilization and analytical procedures.
portal vein study. an independent set of experiments, identical in design to the
pharmacokinetic study above, was designed to identify the mechanism and location of
prodrug hydrolysis. for that purpose, rats were sacrificed under ether anesthesia and
peripheral blood (from the tail vein), portal blood, gastric juice and small intestinal juice
were collected at 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 h after oral dosing. gastric and small intestine juice were

302

a. treiber et al.

obtained by rinsing the stomach or small intestine content twice with 2 ml of saline into
a chilled flask containing 10% diethyl-p-nitro- xxxd2915xxx  in ethanol as esterase
inhibitor. the combined extracts were centrifuged and the supernatant immediately frozen
until analysis. plasma proteins were precipitated with acetonitrile and removed by
centrifugation. the supernatant was removed, evaporated to dryness and the residue
reconstituted in methanol. procedural recovery of radioactivity using this method was
around 90%. aliquots of gastric and intestinal juice were diluted in the same volume
of methanol, centrifuged and the supernatants submitted to hplc analysis.

in vitro studies
prodrug stability. the stability of the perbutyrated prodrug was tested in phosphate
buffered solutions ( ph 8.0), in the presence of liver s9 fraction and with different intestinal
tissue preparations from rat using the [14c]-labeled prodrug. for this purpose, 24-ml
aliquots of the prodrug stock solution in dmso were added to the above solutions or
suspensions at a final concentration of 50 mg/ml and the mixtures incubated at 37 c for up
to 2 h. samples were taken at 0, 5, 10, 30, 60 and 120 min and analyzed by hplc with
radiodetection. the gastrointestinal mucosae were prepared in phosphate buffer (ph 8.0)
with duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon (proximal and distal) according to a published
method (yang et al. 1992). the mucosae were then suspended in physiological saline to
achieve a final concentration of 0.67 mg mucosa/ml. prodrug stability in freshly drawn rat
blood was assessed at a final concentration of 20 mg/ml after incubation at 37 c for 0, 30 and
60 min. aliquots (250 ml) of the incubation mixtures were removed at each time point,
immediately mixed with a 50/50 (v/v) mixture of acetone and methanol and centrifuged
at 16 000 g. the supernatant was separated and dried under a stream of nitrogen.
the residue was reconstituted in 125 ml of a mixture of 52.5% methanol in 20 mm heptane
sulfonic acid in water ( ph 2.5) and submitted to hplc analysis. the prodrug at a
concentration of 50 mg/ml was stable in 1 m phosphate buffer for at least 2 h at 37 c.
in vitro plasma protein binding of  xxxd2645xxx . binding of  xxxd2645xxx  to rat plasma proteins was
determined by ultrafiltration using the [14c]-labeled derivative. plasma was prepared from
blood collected from male sprague-dawley rats (charles river, uk) into tubes containing
lithium heparin as anticoagulant. pooled plasma samples, which had been frozen and thawed
only once, were fortified with [14c]- xxxd2645xxx  at final concentrations of 1, 2, 5, 10 and
20 mg/ml. the samples were incubated at 37 c for 10 min and duplicate aliquots of 100 ml
were assayed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting using a wallac 1410 ( wallac
instruments, milton keynes, uk). duplicate 1-ml aliquots of each plasma sample were
placed into ultrafiltration vials from centrifree micropartition system, then centrifuged at
approximately 2000 g for 15 min at 37 c in a sorvall rc-5b centrifuge. duplicate aliquots
(100 ml) of each ultrafiltrate were assayed for radioactivity. no evidence of plasma protein
binding of  xxxd2645xxx  was observed over the entire range of concentrations.

analytical methods
chromatographic separation and detection. several analytical devices were used for
the different pharmacokinetic experiments. for the pharmacokinetic studies with the
[14c]-prodrug and [3h]- xxxd2645xxx , metabolic profiles were recorded on waters hplc

 xxxd2645xxx  tissue distribution in the rat

303

systems, models 590 and 6000a, connected to a wisp autosampler (model 710b, waters).
chromatographic separation was achieved on a supelcosil lc-8-db column
(15 cm  4.6 mm id, 5 mm) applying a linear gradient at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. mobile
phases were a mixture of 0.02 m aqueous heptane sulfonic acid in 0.01 m aqueous sodium
phosphate (ph 4.5, phase a) and methanol (phase b). mobile phase b was initially increased
linearly from 28% to 95% within 30 min, then kept at 95% for 10 min, and finally brought
back to the initial 28% prior to the next injection. eluent fractions of 1 ml volume were
collected into scintillation vials using a fraction collector (foxy isco, lincoln, ne, usa)
and total radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. reconstructed
radiochromatograms were established by plotting the total radioactivity measured in each
fraction vs. time.
plasma samples from the experiments with [3h]- xxxd2645xxx  were injected onto a reverse
phase c18 column (5 mm id, 5 mm particle size). analytes were eluted isocratically using
an 80/20 (v/v) mixture of 20 mm aqueous heptane sulfonic acid (ph 2–3) and methanol
at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. hplc fractions were collected at 0.5-min intervals in liquid
scintillation vials using a foxy fraction collector (foxy isco, lincoln, ne, usa),
10 ml of pcstm liquid scintillation cocktail (amersham co., arlington heights, il, usa)
were added, and total radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting.
radiochromatograms were reconstructed as described above.
plasma samples from the portal vein study with the [14c]-prodrug were analyzed on a
-bondapack c-18 column ( waters). mobile phases were a mixture of 5 mm dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide ( ph 8) and 25 mm na2hpo4 in water (mobile phase a)
and methanol (mobile phase b). following injection, a linear gradient with a flow rate
of 1.5 ml/min was applied from 5% to 95% of mobile phase b within 25 min, kept at
95% mobile phase b for 5 min, followed by a return to the starting conditions.
radiochromatograms were established by online counting of 14c-radioactivity using
a ‘glass scintillator cell’ gt 200u4 connected to an hplc radioactivity monitor (model
lb 506d, berthold, regensdorf, switzerland). for samples containing low radioactivity
concentrations, the effluent was additionally collected in 1.5-ml fractions and counted using
liquid scintillation counting.
all samples from the in vitro stability testing with [14c]-prodrug were analyzed on an
hp 1050 hewlett packard hplc system equipped with a supelcosil lc-8-db column
(15 cm  4.6 mm id, 5 mm). mobile phases were 20 mm aqueous heptane sulfonic acid
(ph 2.5) and methanol. a linear gradient with a flow rate of 1 ml/min was applied increasing
from 10% to 95% of mobile phase b within 75 min. the mobile phase was additionally
complemented with flo-scint iiitm (packard instrument co., meriden, ct, usa) at a
ratio of (1/4; v/v). the radioactivity was determined using a flo-one radioactivity detector
(beta model ic, packard instruments).
total radioactivity assay. total radioactivity of 14c or 3h in aliquots of plasma, gastric and
intestinal juice, and urine samples was directly determined using a mark iii or wallac 1410
liquid scintillation counter (tracor analytic, elk grove, il, usa or wallac instruments,
milton keynes, uk) after mixing each sample with 10 ml of aquasure (dupont/nen
research products, boston, ma, usa) or pcstm (amersham co., arlington heights, il,
usa). chemical quenching was corrected by means of the automatic external standard
channels ratio method. in all radioactivity measurements, values for radioactivity
disintegrations per minute (dpm) less than two times background were considered as
below assay sensitivity and were not used for calculations. background values were

304

a. treiber et al.

determined by measuring radioactivity in each control matrix prepared in the same way
as the samples obtained from the drug-treated animals.

pharmacokinetic parameter calculation
pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by non-compartmental analysis using the
pharmacokinetic evaluation software winnonlin professionaltm (version 2.1, pharsight
corporation, palo alto, ca. usa) and defined as follows:
. cmax (observed maximum concentration) and tmax (time to reach the maximum
concentration) were determined directly from the plasma concentration-time profiles.
. auc(0-inf ) (area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity) was
calculated by the linear/log trapezoidal rule from time zero to 24 h post-dose and
extrapolated to infinity by using the term clast/z. clast corresponds to the last observed
concentration in any pk profile.
. z (apparent terminal elimination rate) was obtained by log-linear regression of the
terminal phase of the plasma concentration-time curve.
. t½ (apparent terminal half-life) was derived from the equation: t½ ¼ ln 2/z.
. cl (total plasma clearance) was calculated as dose/auc0-inf.
. vss (volume of distribution at steady state) was calculated as mrt  cl (mean residence
time, mrt, defined as aumc0-inf /auc0-inf , where aumc is the area under the first
moment curve).
. f (oral bioavailability) was calculated from the plasma concentration data as:

results
recovery and stability of  xxxd2645xxx 
prior to the pharmacokinetic studies performed with [3h]- xxxd2645xxx , the potential loss of
the tritium label in plasma and urine was investigated. control plasma or urine samples
containing known amounts of [3h]- xxxd2645xxx  were frozen and stored under identical
conditions as the study samples, then extracted to determine the nature of tritium content.
blank plasma was additionally fortified with [3h]- xxxd2645xxx  and then lyophilized. the
recoveries determined from these experiments were all in excess of 95% indicating
a minimal loss of radiolabel during sample storage and analysis. the mean percentage
of radioactivity associated with the [3h]- xxxd2645xxx  peak in the hplc profiles was 99.5%
for plasma and 100% for urine, and [3h]- xxxd2645xxx  was therefore considered stable under
the applied storage and experimental conditions.
pharmacokinetics of [ 3h]- xxxd2645xxx  after intravenous dosing
in the pharmacokinetic experiments with [3h]- xxxd2645xxx , non-volatile tritium was used
as a surrogate marker for  xxxd2645xxx  plasma concentrations. this approach appeared justified
in view of the metabolism and excretion studies showing that virtually all radioactivity
in plasma and urine of rats dosed with [3h]- xxxd2645xxx  represented unchanged drug

 xxxd2645xxx  tissue distribution in the rat

305

(see sections below). pharmacokinetic parameters after intravenous dosing were estimated
following administration at a dose of 160 mg/kg (table i). the half-life of the apparent
elimination phase was 1.2 h while the volume of distribution was 0.8 l/kg. total plasma
clearance was 16 ml/min  kg.

oral absorption and bioavailability
following oral administration of [3h]- xxxd2645xxx  at a dose of 160 mg/kg, non-volatile tritium
was again used for the estimation of the  xxxd2645xxx  pharmacokinetic parameters (table i).
peak plasma concentrations were attained rapidly within 0.5 h after administration and
reached 13.8 mg equivalents/ml, resulting in an oral bioavailability of 57%. similar results
were obtained in a second experiment at a [3h]- xxxd2645xxx  dose of 60 mg/kg (table i),
in which a bioavailability of 38% was determined. mean plasma half-lives in both
experiments were in the range of 5 h and thus significantly longer than those after
intravenous dosing.
as shown in figure 2, plasma concentration vs. time profiles of total radioactivity after
oral administration of equivalent doses of the prodrug (137 mg/kg) and  xxxd2645xxx  (60 mg/kg)
were very similar, with mean cmax and auc values reaching 5.97  0.52 and
3.89  0.54 mg equivalents/ml, and 21.5  3.0 and 23.3  2.4 h  mg equivalent/ml, respectively (table i). as the metabolism studies with the prodrug (see below) indicated that the
vast majority of the prodrug was hydrolyzed to  xxxd2645xxx  prior to reaching the systemic
circulation, the plasma and tissue concentrations of total radioactivity are therefore likely
to reflect those of  xxxd2645xxx  itself.

presystemic metabolism of [14c]-prodrug
the processes determining the conversion of the perbutyrated prodrug to  xxxd2645xxx  were
investigated using a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments. prodrug metabolism
during oral absorption in rats was investigated by using the [14c]-labeled analog and
comparing the metabolic profiles in plasma taken from the portal and peripheral vein.
in both types of plasma,  xxxd2645xxx  accounted for almost 100% of the chromatogram
radioactivity while no peak was observed at the retention time of the prodrug (see figure 3).
following oral administration of [14c]-prodrug at a dose of 137 mg/kg, the nature of drugrelated material was analyzed in the content of stomach and small intestine in order to
determine whether the prodrug might already degrade during passage through the
gastrointestinal tract. analysis of the stomach and small intestine samples indicated that
the majority of radioactivity in both gastrointestinal segments constituted unchanged
prodrug. hplc profiles of the stomach contents identified the prodrug as the only
radiolabeled entity present, indicating that prodrug hydrolysis is unlikely to occur in the
stomach. by contrast, 2.4–18.6% of total radioactivity recovered from small intestine was
present as  xxxd2645xxx , although the majority of radioactivity present in the small intestine was
still unchanged prodrug (43–78%). in line with these observations and the bioavailability
reported above, about 30% of the administered prodrug was excreted unchanged in the feces
within 24 h after dosing.
further support for the hypothesis that prodrug conversion to  xxxd2645xxx  is a pre-systemic
process was derived from incubations of the [14c]-prodrug with mucosa preparations from
sections of various parts of the gastrointestinal tract, i.e. duodenum, jejunum, ileum,
proximal colon and distal colon. in addition, prodrug conversion was determined in the

presence of rat liver s9 fractions and blood (figure 4). in relative terms, prodrug hydrolysis
was fastest in preparations from duodenum and jejunum, followed by the liver s9 fraction
and blood with 81%, 77%, 40% and about 40% of prodrug being hydrolyzed within 10 min
of incubation, respectively. low or no conversion was observed with preparations from the
ileum, proximal colon and distal colon (figure 4), suggesting that prodrug conversion
did not further progress in the distal part of the intestine. one drawback of the experimental
design was the fact that only the disappearance of prodrug concentrations was used to
determine the conversion rates while the appearance of product, i.e.  xxxd2645xxx , was not
monitored. prodrug degradation rates might therefore be overestimated as a consequence of
enhanced tissue partitioning of the lipophilic prodrug.
overall, these results indicate that only a minor part of the prodrug was hydrolyzed in the
intestinal lumen while the majority of prodrug cleavage took place in the duodenum and
jejunum mucosa during gastrointestinal absorption. the absence of prodrug in portal
plasma indicated that prodrug cleavage in the gastrointestinal wall was complete and,
consequently, all measurements of total radioactivity in tissues and organs are indicative of
the levels of  xxxd2645xxx  itself.

tissue distribution
the concentrations and derived pharmacokinetic parameters of  xxxd2645xxx  in various tissues,
plasma and red blood cells (rbc) after oral administration of the [14c]-prodrug at a dose of
137 mg/kg are summarized in tables ii and iii. maximum concentrations (cmax;
mean  se) of total radioactivity in plasma and rbcs were 12.8  3.0 and 11.1  2.5 mg
equivalent/ml, respectively. the corresponding areas under the plasma and rbc
concentration-time curves were 53.3 and 52.4 h  mg equiv./ml. comparable concentrations
in plasma and rbcs at all time points indicated rapid equilibration of  xxxd2645xxx  between
plasma and rbcs and no preferential partitioning or retention therein.
following oral administration, maximum  xxxd2645xxx  concentration in the majority of
tissues was reached already 1 h after dosing (table iii). in some organs, for example
stomach, salivary glands, eye, bone marrow and brain, tmax occurred later, at 4 h, though
the increases over the concentrations reached after 1 h were minor. drug concentrations
in many tissues were equal to or exceeded those in plasma, indicating good partitioning of

 xxxd2645xxx  into most tissues examined (see figure 5 for concentrations in some important
tissues). as expected for a drug after oral administration, the highest tissue concentrations
were observed in the absorptive and excretory organs such as stomach, small intestine, large
intestine and caecum, kidney and urinary bladder (table iii). by contrast, low drug
concentrations were observed in the liver, in line with its minimal role in  xxxd2645xxx 
elimination. relative to the absorptive and excretory organs, all other tissues were less
exposed to  xxxd2645xxx . bone marrow, eyes, lungs, heart, spleen, adrenals and carcass all had
tissue/plasma auc ratios around unity. the tissue/plasma auc ratio for brain was 0.40,
indicating that  xxxd2645xxx  does penetrate into the cns.  xxxd2645xxx  half-life in the brain was
significantly longer than plasma half-life (17 h vs. 5 h, respectively) and consequently brain
concentrations exceeded plasma levels by two-fold at 24 h post-dose (table ii and figure 6).

these data indicate that  xxxd2645xxx  does not only pass the blood–brain barrier but also has the
potential to accumulate in brain after multiple dosing. similar considerations are true for
bone marrow and the carcass with respect to the elevated tissue to plasma concentration
ratios at 24 h compared with 1 h after dosing.
tissue half-lives for most other organs were similar to the plasma half-life of about 5 h.
though some of these values could not be precisely determined due to the limited number
of sampling time points, rapid excretion of radioactivity is obvious from these data. at 24 h
after dosing, residual radioactivity levels in most tissues, including the carcass, accounted for
less than 1% of the dose suggesting that  xxxd2645xxx  is rapidly excreted from the body.

metabolism
metabolism of  xxxd2645xxx  in the rat was limited. unchanged  xxxd2645xxx  was the major entity
in all radiochromatograms accompanied by small amounts of two metabolites. however,
both metabolites together never accounted for more than 16% of total chromatogram
radioactivity in any plasma sample. unchanged  xxxd2645xxx  was also the most prominent entity
in rat urine after intravenous or oral administration of either [3h]- xxxd2645xxx  itself or the
[14c]-prodrug. at intravenous and oral [3h]- xxxd2645xxx  doses of 160 mg/kg, 98.8% and
88.4%, respectively, of the non-volatile tritium was associated with parent compound.

excretion
consistent with the  xxxd2645xxx  plasma half-life of 5 h after oral administration of the
[14c]-prodrug ( tables i and iii), radioactivity was rapidly excreted into rat urine and feces.
the major part of the radioactive dose (84.5%) was recovered within the first 24 h while the
contribution of the subsequent collection periods up to 72 h was only small with an overall
recovery of 88.1%. the mean (se) percentages of total radioactivity recovered in urine
and feces over 72 h were 57  7% and 31  4%, respectively.

discussion
 xxxd2645xxx  (zavescatm) is currently marketed for the treatment of mild to moderate type 1
gaucher disease for those patients for whom enzyme replacement was not a therapeutic
option. while enzyme replacement therapy offers effective therapy for the treatment of the
acute symptoms of gaucher disease, the recent focus more and more considers its chronic
complications such as bone disease and neurological complications. tissue distribution data
are therefore essential for the understanding of the relationship between therapeutic effects
and drug concentrations at the site of action. the present report is the first comprehensive
review on the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2645xxx  in animals and summarizes its main features
with a focus on tissue distribution at therapeutically critical target organs. a number of
pivotal experiments were performed with a perbutyrated prodrug, which at one point was
considered as a means to circumvent the mild diarrhea associated with chronic  xxxd2645xxx 
treatment. as outlined above, this prodrug is entirely cleaved to  xxxd2645xxx  upon
gastrointestinal absorption and is not detectable in either portal or systemic blood. all
conclusions drawn from total radioactivity measurements are therefore indicative of
 xxxd2645xxx  itself.

312

a. treiber et al.

 xxxd2645xxx  was well distributed into tissues based on its volume of distribution of 0.8 l/kg,
which is close to the volume of total body water (table i). plasma clearance was low at
16 ml/min  kg.  xxxd2645xxx  was rapidly absorbed after oral dosing in the rat and peak plasma
concentrations were reached already 30 min post-dosing. oral bioavailabilities ranged from
38% to 57% at doses of 60 and 160 mg/kg, respectively. plasma half-life after oral dosing was
considerably longer (5 h) than after intravenous administration (1.2 h) indicating that oral
pharmacokinetics were absorption-rate limited under these experimental conditions.
more refined data on the extent and time course of tissue distribution were generated after
oral dosing of radiolabeled prodrug, sacrifice of animals at predefined time points and
analysis of total radioactivity levels by liquid scintillation counting ( tables ii and iii).
as shown in figures 5 and 6,  xxxd2645xxx  tissue concentrations declined in parallel to plasma
in the majority of tissues with the exception of the brain, bone marrow and the carcass.
relative brain levels were low at the time of peak plasma concentration (0.5 h) but increased
steadily thereafter as a consequence of the prolonged brain half-life of 17 h ( table iii).
at the end of the 24 h experiment, brain concentrations exceeded those in plasma by a factor
of 2 (figure 6). on the basis of the different tissue half-lives, it is expected that sustained
 xxxd2645xxx  concentrations are present in brain and other parts of the cns after repeated drug
administration. these data clearly demonstrate that  xxxd2645xxx  penetrates the blood–brain
barrier. passive diffusion as a driving force for  xxxd2645xxx  brain partitioning appears unlikely
with respect to the hydrophilic, sugar-like structure. as for other glucose-like molecules,
cerebral uptake might be governed by carrier-mediated transport. however, the exact nature
of these carrier proteins is unknown to date.  xxxd2645xxx  has been proven effective in animal
models (priestman et al. 2000; butters et al. 2005) as well as in man (zimran and elstein,
2003; pastores et al., 2005) suggesting similarities in the tissue distribution pattern across
species.  xxxd2645xxx  penetration into the cns has also been demonstrated in the rhesus
monkey with  xxxd2645xxx  being detected in the cerebrospinal fluid after single and repeated
oral dosing (unpublished data). it is important to note that chronic treatment of rats and
mice for 2 years up to daily doses of 840 mg/kg (yielding at least 14 times the clinical
exposure) was not associated with any adverse neurological findings (unpublished data).
lung exposure to  xxxd2645xxx  developed largely in parallel with the plasma concentrations
and very similar values for  xxxd2645xxx  peak concentration, auc and half-life were
determined. this behavior is in line with the expectations for a hydrophilic drug in a
well-perfused organ.
a determination of  xxxd2645xxx  concentrations in bone tissue was not included in the
experimental design of the present study. however, the analysis of carcass data might yield
information about  xxxd2645xxx  exposure in bone tissue. the carcass represents the remaining
part of the body after removal of the organs and is mainly comprised of muscle, bone, fat and
skin. initial  xxxd2645xxx  levels in the carcass were similar to those in plasma but declined with
an estimated half-life of only 5.4 h compared with 3.8 h in plasma resulting in a tissue/plasma
ratio of 3.8 at the end of the 24 h experiment.  xxxd2645xxx  concentrations in heart as a
surrogate for all muscular tissues were in the range of plasma concentrations and heart/
plasma ratios were around unity at all time points. moreover,  xxxd2645xxx  concentrations in
lipid-rich tissues like fat and skin (rodgers et al. 2005) were low, most likely as a
consequence of its hydrophilic nature. the elevated carcass/plasma ratios might therefore be
interpreted as an indication that a significant portion of the overall radioactivity in the
carcass is associated with bone tissue.
the situation in bone marrow resembled that in brain, exhibiting a delayed attainment of
 xxxd2645xxx  peak concentrations (tmax of 4 h vs. 0.5 h in plasma) and low initial tissue/plasma
ratios. thereafter, tissue levels declined more slowly than those in plasma leading to a rapid

 xxxd2645xxx  tissue distribution in the rat

313

increase of the relative tissue levels up to 2.5 after 24 h. as for the brain, these data imply
an accumulation of  xxxd2645xxx  in bone marrow upon multiple dosing.
the role of metabolism in the elimination of  xxxd2645xxx  in the rat was limited. parent
 xxxd2645xxx  was the major circulating entity in rat plasma accompanied by two minor
metabolites of unknown structure. renal excretion of unchanged  xxxd2645xxx  was the major
excretion pathway and, consequently,  xxxd2645xxx  was also the most prominent entity in urine.
because the value of total clearance (16 ml/min/kg) was about twice the glomerular filtration
rate of 8 ml/min  kg in the rat (grosman et al., 1983), a combination of glomerular filtration
and active secretion seemed to govern renal clearance. biliary excretion of  xxxd2645xxx 
represented a minor process as indicated by the low concentrations of radioactivity in the
liver. this interpretation is in line with the results from the excretion balance study and
the estimated oral bioavailability with the percentage of dose recovered from urine reflecting
the amount being orally absorbed.

conclusion
the present report describes the pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd2645xxx  in the rat with a focus
on tissue distribution. experiments have been performed with radiolabeled  xxxd2645xxx  itself
and with a perbutyrated prodrug, the latter being readily converted to  xxxd2645xxx  during the
gastrointestinal absorption and first-pass metabolism.  xxxd2645xxx  was well absorbed after oral
dosing and exhibited an oral bioavailability of 40–60%. it was widely distributed within the
body and partitioned well into a number of organs that are of therapeutic relevance for the
treatment of patients suffering from gaucher disease. despite its hydrophilic nature,
 xxxd2645xxx  crossed the blood–brain barrier and exhibited a significantly longer half-life in
brain compared with plasma. it was present at high concentrations in the lung with
pharmacokinetic properties similar to those in plasma. based on an analysis of carcass data,
 xxxd2645xxx  bone concentrations are likely to be high and sustained levels are expected in this
tissue after repeated dosing as a consequence of drug retention. the presence of  xxxd2645xxx  in
the cns and bone tissue represents a therapeutic advantage over the established enzyme
replacement therapy due to the innate inability of enzymes to penetrate into both tissues.
 xxxd2645xxx  was eliminated via renal clearance by a combination of glomerular filtration and
active secretion. hepatic clearance was negligible, as was the role of metabolism in the
elimination process of  xxxd2645xxx  in the rat.
