abstract: we recently described that a treatment with the angiotensin  xxxg100xxx  antagonist irbesartan inhibits atherosclerotic lesion
development, macrophage accumulation, and  xxxg357xxx  ( xxxg357xxx ) as well as the chemokine kc expression
in  xxxg177xxx -deficient (apoe-deficient) mice. the present
study addresses whether these and other chemokines are expressed
not only during the initiation but also during the development of atherosclerotic lesions and whether irbesartan can inhibit the expression
of these chemokines during lesion progression. the time course of
lesion development was assessed in apoe-deficient mice aged 1 to 9
months and the relative expression of chemokines was quantified by
rt-pcr. significant lesion formation already appeared in 3-monthold apoe-deficient mice, and progressed further to the age of 9
months. the expression of  xxxg357xxx  and kc (the mouse homologue of
gro␣), was induced at 1 month in apoe-deficient as compared with
wild type (c57/bl6) mice, and was observed before any detectable
histologic changes.  xxxg357xxx  and kc expression remained high during
lesion progression. the expression of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (mip-2, the mouse gro␤/␥ homologue) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1␣ (mip-1␣) was increased in lesions from
4-month-old mice onward, whereas regulated upon activation of
normal t-cells expressed and secreted ( xxxg363xxx ) was significantly
induced in 6- to 9-month-old mice only. irbesartan (50 mg/kg/d) administered from the age of 3 months onward significantly reduced the
progression of the lesions as well as the expression of the chemokines.
a short-term treatment with irbesartan significantly inhibited the expression of  xxxg357xxx  and kc, suggesting that activation of the reninangiotensin system is involved in up-regulation of these chemokines
and that this effect represents a potential mechanism by which irbesartan inhibits plaque development and progression.

a

therosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory and fibroproliferative disease. inflammatory processes play a major role
in all the different steps of plaque formation and proinflammatory cytokines participate in atherogenesis and disease progression.1 chemokines, which are small chemotactic
cytokines, participate early in the progression of atherosclerotic plaques during the adhesion of monocytes and macrophages
to the vascular wall and extravasation. chemokines expressed
in atherosclerotic lesions may be implicated in monocyte recruitment and macrophage differentiation.2 chemokines are a
superfamily of proteins that can be divided into subgroups,
based on the relative position of their cysteine residue motifs
(for review see murphy et al3). the ␣ and ␤ chemokines represent the largest families. ␣-chemokines for which the amino
acid structure presents 1 amino acid between the first 2 cysteine residues are also designated cxc chemokines. ␤-chemokines are characterized by their 2 first adjacent cysteine residues and are called cc chemokines; among them, the
 xxxg357xxx  ( xxxg357xxx ) is the most representative member. direct evidence for a role of  xxxg357xxx  in
atherosclerosis came from  xxxg357xxx  and  xxxg357xxx  receptordeficient mouse models demonstrating a decrease of the atherosclerotic lesions without any effect on the lipid profile4,5
whereas  xxxg357xxx  overexpression accelerated atherogenesis.6
 xxxg357xxx  is involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by
promoting directed migration of inflammatory cells and activation of cells present in the atherosclerotic lesions.7 by activating leukocyte integrins, leading to their binding to specific
receptors at the surface of the endothelium,  xxxg357xxx  also participates in the process of firm adhesion of leukocytes to the
endothelium.8 two other cc chemokines may have atherogenic potential: macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (mip1␣) and the chemokine regulated upon activation of normal
t-cells expressed and secreted ( xxxg363xxx ). indeed, mip-1␣

was detected in advanced atherosclerotic lesions in t-cells9
whereas  xxxg363xxx  was highly expressed in macrophages, lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and myofibroblasts in human
transplant associated atherosclerosis.10 several lines of evidence indicate that cxc chemokines may be implicated in the
progression of atherogenesis. cxc chemokine association
with atherogenesis has been suggested in ldl-receptordeficient mice lacking  xxxg564xxx  expression.11 these mice develop less extensive lesions, macrophage accumulation, and
also less smooth muscle cell proliferation.  xxxg564xxx  is also expressed in human atherosclerotic lesions suggesting the implication of cxc chemokines in the progression of atherosclerotic plaques in humans.2
 xxxg99xxx  exerts pleiotropic effects in the heart and
induces systemic vascular remodeling, which is of particular
relevance in the progression of cardiovascular disease.12 the
renin-angiotensin system (ras) seems to be a major contributor in atherosclerosis progression and several classes of drugs
that inhibit the ras system have been shown to decrease lesion formation.12–15  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists belong to these categories of drugs and are widely used for managing hypertension. it was recently demonstrated that
irbesartan treatment in watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic
rabbits causes reduction of aortic atherosclerosis and aortic intimal surface area.16 interestingly,  xxxg99xxx  induces
 xxxg357xxx  mrna expression and secretion in rat aortic smooth
muscle cells and this transcriptional induction is reversed by
 xxxg100xxx  blockade.17 we recently described the negative
regulation at the mrna level of  xxxg357xxx  and cxc chemokines
in apoe-deficient mice treated with irbesartan during a preventive treatment.15 these observations were correlated with
fewer macrophages and a reduction of lesion size.
to determine the implication of the different members
of the chemokine family in atherosclerosis development, we
carried out a time-course study of plaque formation in the aortic sinus of apoe-deficient mice18 and correlated lesion formation with chemokine mrna expression levels. irbesartan
treatment was performed to assess whether chemokine mrna
induction could be reversed in parallel with lesion regression.
the time-course of the effect of irbesartan on mrna expression provided original data on the early effect of irbesartan in
atherosclerosis development in apoe-deficient mice.

materials and methods
animals and treatment protocol
female homozygous apoe−/− mice on a c57bl/6 background were obtained from iffa credo (les oncins, france) at
4 to 5 weeks of age. the mice were weighed and fed a normal
mouse chow diet ad libitum, or a diet containing irbesartan
(uar, villemoison/orge, france). water was made freely
available to the animals throughout the study. food intake and
weight of each animal were monitored weekly, and the drug

192

dose was calculated from food intake. two different experiments were performed: first, a “preventive” treatment during 3
months starting in 1-month-old apoe-deficient mice; second a
“curative” treatment during 1 month starting in 3-month-old
apoe-deficient mice. this experimental design allowed a direct comparison between mice of the same age that had either
been untreated, or treated for 3 months starting before lesion
development (first experiment), or treated for only 1 month
beginning at an age where the lesions were already apparent
(second experiment). at the end of the different periods, mice
were fasted overnight and anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg; sanofi santé animale, libourne, france).

preparation of aortic sections for lesion
size analysis
the hearts were processed according to a modification
of the method described by paigen et al19. the hearts were
dissected; fixed overnight at 4°c in buffered 4% paraformaldehyde, ph 7.4. the lower half of the hearts was sectioned at a
plane parallel to a line drawn between the tips of the atria and
then discarded. the remaining proximal half was mounted in
oct compound (tissue-tek®, sakura finetek europe, bayer
diagnostics, puteaux france), snap-frozen, and cut in a cryostat (hm500 microm, francheville, france). sequential 10µm thick cross sections were cut until the appearance of the
aortic sinus, which was recognized on unstained sections by
the presence of the 3 leaflets of the aortic valve and the bulging
shape of the aorta. from this point on, every other section was
collected on superfrost plus slides (poly labo, strasbourg,
france) until the valve cusps were no longer visible and the
aorta was uniformly round. sections were then stained with oil
red o (sigma chemical co., saint-quentin fallavier, france)
and counter-stained with hematoxylin.
tissues of additional animals in the different age groups
were used for morphometric analysis. hearts were dissected
out as described previously and soaked overnight in buffered
formaldehyde (10%). the samples were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. five-µm sections were then cut and stained
with masson’s trichrome stain.

quantification of atherosclerosis in
aortic sinus
a computer-assisted image analysis system was used to
quantify the area of atherosclerotic lesions within the sections
(visiolab 2000, biocom, les ulis, france). the area of the
lesions apparent from the oil red o staining was automatically
traced, and the total lesion area for each section was calculated.
ten sequential alternate sections from each animal were analyzed, and the mean lesion area was calculated for each animal
and subsequently for each group. for advanced lesions, the
total lesion area was determined including regions of smooth
muscle proliferation or necrosis.

chemokine and chemokine-receptor
mrna analysis
total rna was prepared from whole aortic tissues (aortic sinus and thoracic aorta) using a modified chomczynski
and sacchi method.20 to confirm that no dna was present in
the total rna, each preparation was checked by pcr amplification of  xxxg861xxx 
( xxxg861xxx ) in the absence of reverse transcription. the fact that
no signal could be detected after gel analysis of the pcr products confirmed that dna was absent in all our rna preparations. rna quantification was performed by od measurement
at 260 nm and rna purity was verified by analysis of the ratio
260/280; 1 µg of each sample was used as template in a reverse
transcription reaction (rt) using the mmlv-rt enzyme
(gibco brl) and pcr amplification was carried out on 2 µl of
30 µl rt product. specific primers were designed for  xxxg357xxx 
(genbank accession number gb: m57441), mip-1␣ (gb
af65094), kc (gb jo4596), granulocyte chemotactic protein-2 (gcp-2, gb u27267), mip-2 (gb x53798), and their receptors  xxxg370xxx  (gb u51717), ccr3 (gb u29677), ccr5 (gb
af022990), and  xxxg564xxx  (gb u31207) (see table 1 for pcr
primer sequence information). to ensure the specificity of the
pcr product, melting temperature (tm) was optimized for
each specific target and the number of cycles was 25 to 30
depending on the abundance of the transcript. the dna pcr
products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel. signal was quantified in densitometric values on a biorad geldoc 2000 apparatus. quantification was performed as the ratio between the
values of each specific target and the internal control  xxxg861xxx  ( xxxg861xxx ).  xxxg861xxx 
mrna levels did not change significantly during lesion development or after irbesartan treatment. results of the quantification were not affected by normalization. results are therefore
expressed as induction levels with the controls set at 1. in contrast to samples from the aortic sinus, pcr amplification of
samples from the isolated thoracic aorta did result in signals

chemokine expression in apoe-deficient mice

that were very weak and could not be quantified accurately.
therefore, chemokine mrna expression in the samples containing the aortic sinus as well as the thoracic aorta is probably
essentially due to expression in the aortic sinus.

statistical analysis
values are reported as mean ± sem. differences in atherosclerotic lesion area were analyzed by the kruskall-wallis
non-parametric test, followed by mann-whitney u tests with
bonferroni corrections and chemokine mrna expression
among groups were tested with one-way anova analysis followed by a scheffe test for all pairs.

results
time-course of lesion progression in
apoe-deficient mice and effect of irbesartan
on lesion progression
in a first set of experiments, the evolution of atherosclerotic lesion development with age was carefully characterized
in the apoe-deficient mouse model of atherosclerosis. apoedeficient mice and c57bl/6 mice were fed a standard chow diet
and lesion size in the aortic root was determined at several ages
for up to 9 months. as demonstrated previously,18,19 significant lesions were already present in the aortic root of apoedeficient mice at the age of 3 months and these lesions progressed strongly thereafter (fig. 1 and fig. 2). by contrast,
c57bl/6 mice did not display any lesions when fed a standard
chow diet at any age (fig. 1). histologically, the evolution of
the lesions with age in apoe-deficient mice was as follows
(fig.1): no lesions at 1 month, fatty streak type lesions at 3
months, lesion extension with intimal thickening and smooth
muscle proliferation at 4 months, appearance of cholesterol
clefts and first necrotic regions at 6 months, all-encompassing
lesions with cholesterol clefts and extensive necrotic, acellular
regions at 9 months. to determine whether irbesartan treat-

to determine whether different stages of lesion development are associated with the appearance of specific chemokines and/or receptors, the relative expression of different chemokines and chemokine receptors was quantified by rt-pcr
in the aortas of apoe-deficient and c57bl/6 mice aged 1, 3, 4,
6, and 9 months. in aortic tissue,  xxxg357xxx  mrna levels were
already high at 1 month (> 2-fold; p < 0.01 scheffe test) in
apoe-deficient versus c57bl/6 mice (fig. 3a). this induction
increased linearly until 6 months and then reached a plateau of
about a 3-fold induction in apoe-deficient versus c57bl/6
mice. in c57bl/6 mice,  xxxg357xxx  rna expression also changed
in a time-dependent manner, being doubled in 9-month-old
versus 1-month-old animals. the expression of  xxxg370xxx , the receptor of  xxxg357xxx , was somewhat higher in apoe-deficient
mice (less than 2-fold induction over c57bl/6) and increased
slightly with age in apoe-deficient as well as in c57bl/6 mice
(fig. 3b). among other cc chemokines tested, mip-1␣ was
highly induced in 4-month-old apoe-deficient mice (4-fold induction; p < 0.01 scheffe test) (fig. 4a). although the induction was somewhat lower in 6-month-old mice, it remained
highly significant and increased further at 9 months with more
than a 3-fold induction. in c57bl/6 mice, mip-1␣ expression
levels also increased slightly with time.  xxxg363xxx  was the third
chemokine to be up-regulated during the evolution of lesion
formation (fig. 4b). a significant increase of  xxxg363xxx 
mrna levels was observed at 6 months and its expression rose

figure 3. time course of  xxxg357xxx  and  xxxg370xxx  mrna expression
in apoe-deficient and c57bl/6 mice. c57bl/6 and apoedeficient mice were maintained in normal condition of breeding until 1, 3, 4, 6, and 9 months of age. at these different time
points, the thoracic aorta including the aortic sinus was dissected out, rna was extracted, and rt-pcr for  xxxg357xxx  (a) and
 xxxg370xxx  (b) were performed as described under “materials and
methods”. data were normalized for changes in  xxxg861xxx 
mrna levels and are expressed as mean ⳳ sem, n = 5.

further linearly up to 9 months. mrna levels of the ccr3
receptor fluctuated somewhat and did not differ between apoedeficient and c57bl/6 mice (fig. 4c). similarly, no significant
change could be observed in the  xxxg363xxx  and mip-1␣ receptor ccr5 mrna levels (fig. 4d).

kc, mip-2, and gcp-2 mrna expression
rapidly induced during lesion formation
the induction of cxc chemokines occurred rapidly and
was already significant at 1 month for kc (1.2-fold induction;
p < 0.05 scheffe test) and 3 months for gcp-2 (3.5-fold induction, p < 0.001 scheffe test, fig. 5b). the induction of kc
was further increased (5-fold induction; p < 0.01 scheffe test)
at 3 months of age in apoe-deficient versus c57bl/6 mice (fig.
5a) and reached a maximum of 10-fold induction after 4
months. mip-2 mrna levels peaked at 4 months (10-fold induction) and gcp-2 mrna levels were maximal at 9 months
(fig. 5b and 5c). in c57bl/6 mice, kc, gcp-2, and mip-2
mrna levels increased slightly with time. the levels at 9
months were 2-fold higher compared with the levels observed
in 1-month-old mice. the mrna levels of  xxxg564xxx , the receptor for kc, gcp-2, and mip-2, did not show any consistent
variation with age in c57bl/6 and apoe-deficient mice, but
differed slightly at 9 months, probably due to a higher degree
of variability (fig. 5d).

induction of  xxxg357xxx , mip-1␣, kc, and mip-2
expression during lesion development
decreased by  xxxg100xxx  blockade
to determine whether the induction of chemokine expression in apoe-deficient versus c57bl/6 mice was due to an
up-regulation of the ras system, 2 individual experiments
were performed with irbesartan.

figure 4. time course of mip-1␣ and  xxxg363xxx , as well as
ccr3 and ccr5 during lesion formation. c57bl/6 and apoedeficient mice were maintained in normal condition of breeding until 1, 3, 4, 6, and 9 months of age. at these different time
points, the thoracic aorta including the aortic sinus was dissected out, rna was extracted, and rt-pcr for mip-1␣ (a),
 xxxg363xxx  (b), ccr3 (c), and ccr5 (d) were performed as described under “materials and methods”. data were normalized
for changes in  xxxg861xxx  mrna levels and are expressed as mean
ⳳ sem, n = 5.

first, as shown in figure 6, a preventive treatment of 3
months dramatically decreased  xxxg357xxx , kc, mip-1␣, and
mip-2 mrna induction in apoe-deficient mice (fig. 6). in
contrast,  xxxg806xxx  mrna levels were not affected by the treatment (data not shown). furthermore,  xxxg370xxx  mrna expression
was unaffected whereas  xxxg564xxx  mrna expression was increased under these conditions (data not shown), as demonstrated previously.15
second, a 1-month treatment in 3 month-old mice with
established lesions resulted in a 50% inhibition of  xxxg357xxx 
mrna levels, and also significantly reduced kc, mip-1␣, and
mip-2 mrna expression. however, this short treatment did
not affect either  xxxg370xxx  or  xxxg564xxx  mrna expression (not
shown).
due to the significant effect of irbesartan at 1 month on
the major targets implicated in atherosclerosis, we decided to
treat apoe-deficient mice during a very short period of time: 1,
3, and 7 days of treatment. among the different chemokines
and chemokine-receptors analyzed, only  xxxg357xxx  and kc transcription was significantly inhibited after 7 days of treatment
(fig. 7).

interestingly, chemokine expression patterns showed a
clear sequence of events in apoe-deficient mice as compared
with the c57bl/6 control mice, which only showed a slowly
progressive parallel increase of the different chemokine
mrna levels, probably due to an age-related change in the
tissue structure. in apoe-deficient mice however, the following sequence emerged:  xxxg357xxx  and kc were the only chemo-

discussion
the implication of chemokines in atherosclerotic lesion
development has been the focus of intense research efforts in
the past few years. as a result, a whole host of converging
experiments show that  xxxg357xxx  is involved in macrophage accumulation and subsequent lesion development in different
mouse and rabbit models, and is also present in human lesions.4–6 however, all these studies were performed either by
deleting the chemokine genes of interest in mice or by determining the chemokine expression levels (either protein or
mrna) during early lesion development. but, up to now, no
study has reported the chemokine expression during lesion
progression from early fatty-streak type lesions to complex lesions consisting of necrotic core regions surrounded by a fibroproliferative cap. this study was therefore designed to determine (i) whether expression levels of different chemokines
thought to be involved in lesion development vary during lesion progression, (ii) from what time point onward these chemokines appear in the lesions, and (iii) to what degree these
variations of expression are related to angiotensin receptor activation as assessed by the effect of a treatment with the potent
 xxxg100xxx  antagonist: irbesartan.

kines that were already induced at very early time points (1
month), when significant lesions were not detected yet. gcp-2
and mip-2 expression levels rose with the appearance of the
first lesions in mice at 3 months of age. increased expression of
mip-1␣ was only detected from 4 months onward, when lesions of an intermediate type appeared, and  xxxg363xxx  expression increased at 6 months of age when the first necrotic regions were detected. the very early increase in  xxxg357xxx 
expression detected here is consistent with previous data
showing that  xxxg357xxx  is strongly implicated in macrophage influx in early lesions, monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells in
lesion-prone regions having been detected very early in the
lesion process.21 although the role of kc in monocyte arrest
has recently been demonstrated,22 the importance of other
cxc chemokines, in particular cgp2 and mip-2␣, in lesion
development has not been described yet, although indirect data
and experiments with  xxxg564xxx -receptor-deficient mice point to
the importance of cxc chemokines in atherosclerotic lesion
development.11 however, kc (the mouse homologue of
gro␣) and mip-2 (the mouse homologue of gro␤/␥) can be
produced by t-cells, macrophages, and are found in atherosclerotic lesions.23 moreover,  xxxg564xxx , their receptor, is expressed on a subset of monocytes and t-cells,24–26 and smooth
muscle cells have the capacity to express the receptor.27
several different functions have been proposed for cxc chemokines in lesion progression: monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells,28,29 monocyte-macrophage activation,30 and retention/maturation of macrophages31 as well as transmigration
and proliferation activities on smooth muscle.11,32 these findings are consistent with our results that clearly show the early
induction of kc, mip-2, and gcp-2 during the study of lesion
development.
the implication of  xxxg363xxx  in atherosclerotic lesion
development has only very recently been addressed. actually,
von hundelshausen et al33 showed that  xxxg363xxx  may play a
role in monocyte arrest on inflamed endothelium and thus participate in the accumulation of macrophages in lesioned regions. these authors did not detect  xxxg363xxx  immunostaining
in early lesions of apoe-deficient mice but found a significant
staining after induction of intimal lesions or after administration of a high-fat diet. interestingly,  xxxg363xxx  mrna could
not be detected in our studies at the early time points, but we
found an unexpected late rise of  xxxg363xxx  mrna levels in
lesions from 6- and 9-month-old mice. these findings suggest
that  xxxg363xxx  is only induced after the appearance of the first
necrotic spots in the lesions, which may lead to induction of
cytokines and their diffusion to the intima where  xxxg363xxx 
expression has been shown to occur. taken together, these data
make a strong case for studying the importance of  xxxg363xxx 
expression in late atherosclerotic lesions in more detail.

chemokine expression in apoe-deficient mice

apoe-deficient mice.15 this article shows that mip-1␣ mrna
expression is strongly increased in lesions from 4-month-old
mice onward. this suggests that mip-1-␣ is probably not involved in lesion initiation, but may participate in lesion progression. this hypothesis will have to be substantiated however, and further work is in progress to clarify this point.
in this article, we wanted to determine which chemokines are up-regulated in atherosclerotic plaques of different
structure and complexity. although a clear evolution in the
chemokine expression is apparent, expression data do not allow us to determine which chemokines are specifically upregulated by intraplaque mediators and which chemokines are
simply indicators of changing plaque composition. as a first
step to identify the chemokines that are up-regulated by inflammatory reactions inside the plaques, we have used a treatment with the  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonist irbesartan. indeed,  xxxg99xxx  has been shown to play a major role in
chemokine induction both in vitro and in vivo. indeed,  xxxg99xxx  induces  xxxg357xxx  expression in macrophages and
smooth muscle cells34 and  xxxg99xxx  infusion in apoedeficient mice has been shown to strongly increase the severity
of atherosclerotic lesions.35,36 moreover, several studies in
different species including mice, rabbits, and monkeys have
shown that ace inhibitors or  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists decrease the development of atherosclerosis34,37–41 and
we have shown previously that treatment of apoe-deficient
mice with irbesartan from weaning to up to the age of 4 months
not only dramatically reduced lesion development, but also decreased the expression of some of the chemokines studied here
(ie,  xxxg357xxx , kc, gcp-2, and mip-1␣). we have extended
these studies by starting the treatment with irbesartan in
3-month-old mice that have already developed significant initial lesions. under these conditions, irbesartan decreased lesion progression, although lesions still increased to some extent with age, showing that the renin-angiotensin system plays
an important role in lesion progression but also suggesting that
other mechanisms also contribute to lesion extension. to determine which chemokines might be down-regulated under the
conditions of lesion progression, we then compared the effect
of an early treatment with irbesartan to the results obtained
with an initiation of the treatment 1 month before lesion measurement. under these conditions, the levels of all the chemokines that were decreased during the early treatment were also
significantly decreased when the treatment was started in
3-month-old mice, although the decrease was slightly lower.
this suggests that up-regulation of chemokines by the reninangiotensin system plays a role not only in lesion initiation, but
also during lesion progression. however, in this study it was
still not possible to determine whether the inhibitory effect on
the expression of the different chemokines was an indirect consequence of the decrease in plaque size or a change of the cellular composition of the plaques, or whether inhibition of the
local effect of  xxxg99xxx  directly decreased the expression

of specific chemokines. we therefore treated apoe-deficient
mice with established lesions for very short periods of time
with irbesartan. in these studies, it clearly appeared that both
 xxxg357xxx  and kc were significantly down-regulated after only 1
week of treatment with irbesartan. during this very short treatment period, plaques could not loose chemokine-expressing
cells to a degree sufficient to explain the decrease in  xxxg357xxx 
and kc expression. these data therefore suggest that  xxxg357xxx 
and kc are directly up-regulated by activation of at1 receptors in atherosclerotic plaques and add kc to the chemokines
possibly mediating the pro-atherogenic effects of angiotensin
ii. the up-regulation of mip-1␣ or mip-2 was not affected by
a short-term treatment with irbesartan, but this may be due to
the fact that these chemokines were not yet significantly upregulated during this phase of the lesion formation. these results are of particular interest in view of the recent findings that
both kc and  xxxg357xxx  acting in concert are required to induce
monocyte adhesion and migration into the lesion areas.22 inhibition of only one of these chemokines would therefore be
expected to reduce monocyte influx in lesion areas. since irbesartan reduces the expression of both of these chemokines
after very short treatment periods, such an effect might explain
why this compound shows such potent effects in the early
phases of lesion development. concerning the other chemokines detected in the lesions, further work will be necessary to
determine whether they are associated with particular cell
types present in the lesions and thus, can be considered as
markers of lesion cell composition or whether their expression
is up-regulated by inflammatory cytokines or other mediators
in the plaques.
in conclusion, chemokine mrna expression patterns in
the atherosclerotic lesions of apoe-deficient mice vary with
age and plaque composition.  xxxg357xxx  and kc are up-regulated
early before any lesions become apparent; mip-1␣, mip-2,
and gcp-2 appear concomitantly with the first lesions; and
 xxxg363xxx  is only induced in the late phases of lesion development, in parallel with the emergence of the first necrotic regions. irbesartan decreases lesion progression and very
quickly reduces  xxxg357xxx  and kc mrna levels. since both of
these chemokines remain elevated during lesion progression, a
decrease of their expression levels by angiotensin receptor
blockers may explain their effect not only on lesion initiation
but also on lesion progression.
