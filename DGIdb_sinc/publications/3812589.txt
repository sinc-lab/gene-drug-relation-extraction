a male infant with methyllb12 deficiency ( xxxg1480xxx ) presented at age 6 weeks with
lethargy, staring spells, and vomiting. he later became hypotonic and unresponsive to stimuli and required intubation and ventilation. he had homocystinuria and
hypomethioninemia with megaloblastic anemia but normal serum folate and vitamin b12 concentrations. no methylmalonic aciduria was detected. fibroblasts,
cultured from the patient, were unable to grow in medium in which homocysteine
replaced methionine and incorporated abnormally small amounts of [''c]-methyitetrahydrofolate but normal amounts of [ i4c]-propionate into protein. methyl-b12
content of fibroblasts was low, while the aden0sy1-b~~
content was normal.
 xxxg1479xxx  activity was decreased when the assay was performed under
both optimal and suboptimal reducing conditions, suggesting heterogeneity in the
 xxxg1480xxx  disease. the patient responded dramatically to  xxxd2300xxx  treatment.
homocystinuria disappeared after 10 days of therapy, and methionine was normalized after 3 weeks. psychometric testing at age 15 months showed a developmental age of 9 months.
key words:  xxxg1479xxx ,  xxxg1480xxx , cobalamin

megaloblastic anemia [schuh et al, 1984; rosenblatt et al, 19841. fibroblasts from
patients with this disorder, which we have called  xxxg1480xxx  (fig. l), contain abnormallly
low amounts of ch3-b12and low  xxxg1479xxx  activity at low but not at usual
concentrations of thiol in the assay. when the mother of the propositus became
pregnant, prenatal diagnosis identified an affected fetus who was successfully treated
with  xxxd2300xxx  (oh-b12) [rosenblatt et al, 1985al. here we report on an
infant who presented early in life with megaloblastic anemia and severe neurologic
manifestations. this infant with methylcobalamin deficiency also responded dramatically to therapy with oh-bi2.in contrast to cells from the original family, fibroblasts
from this patient had low levels of  xxxg1479xxx  activity even under usual
reducing conditions, suggesting heterogeneity in this disorder.
clinical report

the propositus, a caucasian, was born by spontaneous vaginal delivery to a 25year-old mother and 30-year-old father. the parents were nonconsanguineous and
had two healthy children, aged 2 and 4 years, and no fetal losses. the birth weight
was 3,650 gm; length, 54 cm. apgar scores were 7 and 8 at i and 5 minutes,
respectively. his neonatal course was uneventful, but at 3 weeks, his mother was
concerned that he apparently could not see. at age 4 weeks, he was given zoster

immune globulin because his sibs had developed varicella, but he subsequently
developed mild varicella. by 6 weeks, he had become lethargic, and over the next 2
weeks, he developed staring spells, fell asleep during feeding, and began vomiting.
 xxxd1891xxx  weeks of age, his eeg showed spike discharges, and ct scan showed
cortical atrophy and mild ventricular dilatation. his hematocrit was 22.6 % , reticulocyte count was 0.4%, and the bone marrow showed megaloblastic erythropoiesis
despite normal serum concentrations of b12and folate.
at age 3 months, he was transferred to the university of florida hospital. his
weight was 5.1 kg (loth centile); length, 66.5 cm (95th centile); and head circumference, 37 cm (2nd centile). he was hypotonic, did not respond to stimuli, and exhibited
periodic breathing. he was intubated and ventilated.
laboratory investigation showed anemia (despite previous transfusion) with a
hematocrit of 24.4% and a wbc of 2,800. blood gases, electrolytes, and liver
function tests were normal. the urine gave a weakly positive nitroprusside test and a
negative spot test for methylmalonic acid. chromatography of urine showed a prominent homocysteine spot.  xxxd2794xxx  excretion was 29.1 pglmg creatinine, and his
serum contained 8 pm methionine (normal, 25-69 pm). the abnormalities were
thought to be due to a defect in homocysteine remethylation.
therapy was started with oral methionine supplementation (500 mg/day), pyridoxine (100 mg/day),  xxxd2147xxx  (50 mg/day), and oh-b12 (1 mg/day, im) after 10
days, homocysteine was not detectable in the urine; and after the third week of
therapy, methionine level was 69 pm. his neurological status began to improve after
about 1 week. at 3 weeks, following unsuccessful attempts to wean him from
ventilation, laryngoscopy showed supraglottic edema with laryngomalacia, and a
tracheostomy was performed.
six weeks after admission, although he required intermittent mandatory ventilation, he was alert, smiling responsively, crying for feedings, and making purposeful
movements. he had marked nystagmus and seemed essentially blind.
a gastrostomy tube was placed after 8 weeks because of feeding difficulties.
ventilatory support was stopped 9 weeks after his admission. his neurological status
continued to improve; at the time of his discharge at age 6 months, he was responsive
to sounds and laughed in response to his name. however, he remained hypotonic and
demonstrated marked nystagmus, and there was concern about his vision.
ct scans of the head performed 1, 3, and 9 months after his admission showed
decrease in ventricular size and marked improvement of his cerebral atrophy (fig.
2). developmental assessment at 6 months of age showed a 0-2 month level; but by
11 months, he performed 40% of the tasks at a 6-8 month level. he was sitting alone
 xxxd2274xxx  months, was crawling by 9 months, and was pulling to standing and imitating
facial expressions by 13 months.
when last seen at 15 months, his weight was 9.6 kg (10%); height, 81 cm
(75%); and head circumference, 45 cm (2%). he smiled responsively and had begun
babbling speech. he seemed to have good vision up to a few feet and would copy
grimaces and blow kisses. psychometric testing showed development equivalent to 9
months of age. his hemoglobin was 12.6 g/dl; hematocrit, 36.7%; mcv, 83. serum
amino acids were normal, with a methionine concentration of 30 p m .
he continues to receive oh-bi2 three times weekly, and pyridoxine and  xxxd2908xxx . methionine and  xxxd2146xxx  supplementation were recently discontinued.

materials and methods

fibroblasts were routinely grown in eagle's minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum plus nonessential amino acids [rosenblatt et al, 19791.
 xxxg1479xxx  activity and uptake of ['4c]propionate, [i4c]methyl-tetrahydrofolate, and [57co]cyanocobalaminwere all determined as described previously [schuh
et al, 1984; rosenblatt et al, 19841. fractionation of intracellular cobalamins was
performed on dried, hot ethanol extracts of cells using high-pressure liquid chromatography [rosenblatt et al, 19841. all procedures involving cobalamins were performed in the dark because of the photolability of the cobalamins.
results

fibroblasts from the patient did not grow in culture medium in which homocysteine replaced methionine (fig. 3). incorporation by the patient's cells of
['4c]methyltetrahydr~folate into protein was 16.0 and 13.8 pmoles/mg protein/ 18 h
in the absence of oh-b12 in the culture medium and 2 1.1 and 16 pmoles/mg protein/
18 h in the presence of oh-bi2. the control line incorporated 119.5 and 96.5 pmoles/
mg protein/l8 h without oh-bi2 and 151.4 and 140.1 pmoles/mg protein/l8 h with
oh-bi2. in contrast, [''c]propionate incorporation in the patient's cells was 5.3
nmoles/mg proteidl8 h in the absence of oh-b12 and 5.6 nmoles/mg protein/l8 h in
the presence of oh-bi2, both values being in the range found for controls.
total uptake of [57co]-cn-b12was 5.25 pg (1,169 cpm)/106 cells/4 days, as
compared to 6.42 pg (1,428 cpm)/106 cells/4 days in the control line. in cells from
the patient, only 5.6% of the intracellular bi2 was ch3-b12,as compared to 60.5%

indicated.

in the control line. adenosylcobalamin (ado-b12) levels were 14.2% both in the
patient’s and in the control cells.
under standard reducing conditions,  xxxg1479xxx  holoenzyme activities
in the patient’s fibroblasts were 5.8 and 20.8 units (pmoles methioninelmg protein/
min) in the absence and presence of oh-bi2in the culture medium, respectively, as
compared to 16 and 121.9 units in the control cell line.  xxxg1479xxx  total
enzyme activities in the patient’s fibroblasts were 13.1 and 35.9 units in the absence
and presence of oh-b12in the culture medium, respectively, as compared to 56.4 and
183 units in the control cell line.
as compared to control extracts,  xxxg1479xxx  activity assayed in a
reaction mixture containing reduced levels of dithiothreitol was disproportionately
decreased (fig. 4). for example, at 5 mm dithiothreitol, activity in the patient’s cells
was only 11.8% of the activity at 37.5 mm dithiothreitol, as compared to 91.1% in
the control cell line.
discussion

fibroblasts from the previously reported sibs with  xxxg1480xxx  disease [schuh et al,
1984; rosenblatt et al, 1984, 1985al had uptake of [57co]-cn-b12equivalent to that
of control cells but low levels of ch3-b12.  xxxg1479xxx  activity in fibroblast
extracts from the original sibs was also equivalent to that of control cell extracts when
the assay was performed under standard reducing conditions but was low when
suboptimal reducing conditions were used. similarly, fibroblasts from the patient
described in this report had [57co]-cn-b12uptake equivalent to that of controls and
low ch3-b12levels; but in contrast,  xxxg1479xxx  activity was reduced in the
presence of both optimal and suboptimal concentrations of reducing agent in the

proband with methylcobalamin deficiency ( xxxg1480xxx ). cells were preincubated in 0.75 pm 0h-bi2 for 4
days. extracts were assayed in the presence of 50 pm ch3-bi2(total enzyme) and varying concentrations of dithiothreitol as indicated. control cell extract contained 1.9 mg protein;  xxxg1480xxx  extract, 1.45 mg

assay. because of the apparent heterogeneity of  xxxg1479xxx  activity, we are
conducting complementation experiments using ['4c]methyl-tetrahydrofolate uptake
in cells from the different patients with functional  xxxg1479xxx  deficiency to
help determine whether more than one locus is involved in producing the  xxxg1480xxx 
phenotype.
several disorders need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of this
patient. neurologic abnormalities, homocystinuria, methylmalonic aciduria, and megaloblastic anemia suggest an abnormality of vitamin bq metabolism of the cblc or
cbld type [rosenberg, 1983; willard et al, 1978; mellman et al, 19791. the recently
described patient with cblf disease [rosenblatt et al, 1985bl had methylmalonic
aciduria and developmental delay but neither homocystinuria nor anemia. megaloblastosis without either homocystinuria or methylmalonic aciduria, with or without
neurologic abnormalities, and with a normal serum folate concentration suggests a
diagnosis of transcobalamin i1 deficiency [frker-schroder, 19831. neurologic abnormalities and megaloblastosis without either homocystinuria or methylmalonic aciduria
but with a low serum folate concentration suggest congenital malabsorption of folate
[lanzkowsky, 19701. diagnosis of this disorder depends on demonstrating abnormal
absorption of physiological doses of  xxxd2146xxx  in the absence of other gastrointestinal
abnormalities.

like the original patient with ch3-b12 deficiency, the propositus appeared
normal at birth but subsequently developed serious illness in association with an
infectious process. in the first patient, the infectious agent was rotovirus; in our
patient, it was varicella. of note, this patient had severe megaloblastic anemia along
with homocystinuria but no methylmalonic aciduria. the patient responded clinically
and metabolically to a combination of four potentially therapeutic agents, but oh-b12
was probably the effective therapy, based on the response to oh-b1:! in the original
patient. interestingly, the serial ct scans showed an improvement in the extent of
ventricular enlargement and of cerebral atrophy. in view of the good results in the
second affected child of the original family from early therapy for a similar disorder
[rosenblatt et al, 1985a1, we hope that the disorder in the present patient will not
progress and will continue to respond to vitamin therapy. it appears that methylcobalamin deficiency must be diagnosed prior to severe early deterioration in order to
prevent neurological sequelae. infants with megaloblastic anemia deserve to be
carefully evaluated for minimal homocystinuria in the presence of low or normal
serum methionine concentrations in view of the apparent treatability of this disorder.
