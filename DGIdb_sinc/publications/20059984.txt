introduction

as an important endogenous analgesic neurotransmitter,
noradrenaline is released in the spinal cord from bulbospinal
noradrenergic axons which originate from the lc and adjacent
nuclei in the brainstem, and suppresses the neurotransmission of pain in the spinal cord via activation of  xxxg831xxx  adrenoceptors (aston-jones et al., 1991). although various neurochemical
inputs modulate neuronal activity of noradrenergic neurons in
the lc, glutamate is considered as a primary excitatory

regulator (singewald and philippu, 1998). a major glutamate
input to the lc arises from the nucleus paragigantocellularis
and activates noradrenergic neurons via ampa receptors
(singewald and philippu, 1998). we have recently demonstrated that one of the commonly used treatments for chronic pain,
gabapentin, activates descending inhibition via glutamatergic
signaling in the lc and induces spinal noradrenaline release in
rats and human (hayashida et al., 2007; hayashida et al., 2008).
glutamate is, therefore, an important substance not only for
physiological but also for pharmacological regulation of the lc

activity. however, local regulation of glutamate signaling in
the lc is poorly understood. in the central nervous system,
glial cells, primarily astrocytes, regulate extracellular glutamate concentrations. astrocytes express two types of glutamate transporters,  xxxg2103xxx  and glast (anderson and swanson,
2000). under physiological conditions, glutamate transporters
take up glutamate from the extracellular space and terminate
excitation from synaptically released glutamate. however, in
pathological conditions such as ischemia, astrocytes release
large amounts of glutamate via reverse transport into the
extracellular space, which participates in neurotoxicity (malarkey and parpura, 2008).
riluzole, a neuroprotective drug approved for amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (brooks, 2009), has been recognized to possess
analgesic properties in a wide range of animal pain models
when systemically or intrathecally administered (coderre et
al., 2007; irifune et al., 2007; munro et al., 2007; sung et al., 2003).
recent studies demonstrated that riluzole activates  xxxg2103xxx  and
glast to enhance glutamate uptake (frizzo et al., 2004;
fumagalli et al., 2008), and reduces extracellular glutamate
level in the spinal cord (coderre et al., 2007). based on these
studies, one would hypothesize that local injection of riluzole
into the lc would reduce extracellular glutamate concentrations, thereby reducing descending inhibition and potentially
exacerbating hypersensitivity after peripheral nerve injury.
surprisingly, we demonstrate here that lc-injected riluzole
reduced rather than exacerbated hypersensitivity in rats after
l5-l6 snl. we therefore tested whether lc-injected riluzole
activates descending noradrenergic inhibition in snl rats, and
whether riluzole activates noradrenergic neurons in the lc in
brainstem slices, with a focus on glutamatergic signaling.
glutamate induces ca2+-dependent glutamate release from
astrocytes via activation of ca2+ permeable ionotropic ampa
receptors and group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors
(mglurs), which release ca2+ from internal stores through
1,4,5-inositol-trisphosphate (insp3) signaling (hansson et al.,
2000; verkhratsky and kirchhoff, 2007). in some astrocytes, cotransport of sodium ions and glutamate by glutamate
transporters results in ca2+ influx via the reverse mode of
na/ca exchange to thereby increase intracellular ca2+ concentration (rojas et al., 2007), which in turn leads to glutamate
release from astrocytes via ca2+-dependent exocytosis (malarkey and parpura, 2008). we therefore hypothesized that
glutamate-induced glutamate release in astrocytes may be
enhanced by activation of glutamate transporters. to examine
this hypothesis, we test the effect of riluzole on glutamateinduced glutamate release from primary astrocyte culture.
normal activity of cells in the lc has been hypothesized to
reflect in part inter-cellular communication via gap junctions.
gap junctions are formed by connexons (hemichannels),
which are composed of connexin, which create a pore that
allows molecules such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate to
diffuse between cells without entering the extracellular
space (kielian, 2008). electrical coupling of noradrenergic
neurons in the lc demonstrates synchronized spontaneous
oscillations in membrane potential that underlie spontaneous
activity, which are disrupted by pharmacological blockade of
gap junctions (ballantyne et al., 2004). interestingly, such
oscillations also occur in adjacent astrocytes, and this
oscillatory activity in both astrocytes and noradrenergic

81

neurons requires communication via gap junctions (alvarezmaubecin et al., 2000). we therefore hypothesized that gapjunction couplings in the lc serve as an important setting for
paradoxical activation of descending inhibition by riluzole. we
therefore tested effects of gap-junction blockers on riluzoleinduced anti-hypersensitivity and neuronal activation in the
lc to examine whether coupling or communication through
gap junctions was involved in riluzole's actions in the lc.

results

2.1.
behavioral effect of intra-lc injection of riluzole in
hypersensitivity after nerve injury
snl strongly decreased the withdrawal threshold to pressure
on the hindpaw ipsilateral to snl from 138 ± 9 g to 72 ± 12 g
(mean ± sd, p < 0.0001, n = 45). intra-lc injection of riluzole
dose-dependently increased withdrawal threshold in the paw
ipsilateral to snl, with significant anti-hypersensitivity efficacy from 1 to 5 mug compared to vehicle (fig. 1). the peak
effect of riluzole was observed 15 min after injection. in these
blinded experiments, neither vehicle nor riluzole was associated with signs of sedation.
intrathecal administration of the  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan (30 mug), which itself did not affect withdrawal
threshold, completely blocked the anti-hypersensitivity effect
of intra-lc riluzole (1 mug, fig. 2). intra-lc injection of the ampa
antagonist, cnqx (0.3 mug), also blocked riluzole's effect (fig. 2).
the dose of cnqx was determined from our previous study
showing that intra-lc injection of 0.3 mug cnqx itself did not
affect withdrawal threshold in snl rats (hayashida et al., 2008).
to test whether functional coupling through gap junction is
required for the anti-hypersensitivity effect of riluzole in the lc,
we utilized two structurally different gap-junction blockers, cbx
(1 mug) and mec (1 mug). cbx and mec, neither of which affected

activate lc neurons. we utilized dbetah as a marker for
noradrenergic neurons and pcreb as a marker for neuronal
activation as previously reported (hayashida et al.). fig. 3
depicts dbetah and pcreb expression in the lc in the brainstem
slices from normal animals treated with vehicle or riluzole
(1 mum). the riluzole-treated brainstem slice showed clear
pcreb-immunoreactive nuclei in dbetah-immunoreactive cells
(figs. 3d–f), while very few cells expressed pcreb in the
vehicle-treated (figs. 3a–c). as shown in fig. 4, riluzole
increased in a concentration-related manner the percentage
of dbetah-immunoreactive cells which expressed pcreb in the
lc compared to the vehicle. riluzole showed its maximum
efficacy at 1 mum, however, its efficacy decreased  xxxd1891xxx  mum,
possibly due to inhibition of voltage-dependent sodium
channels and ampa-mediated current at this higher concentration (albo et al., 2004; lamanauskas and nistri, 2008).
figs. 5a–c show representative photomicrographs of the
lcs treated with riluzole (1 mum) in the presence or absence of
cnqx (50 mum) and cbx (50 mum). consistent with behavioral
observations in snl rats, cnqx and cbx, neither of which
affected basal pcreb expression in dbetah-immunoreactive cells
in the lc of normal rats, abolished riluzole-induced pcreb
activation (fig. 5d).

withdrawal threshold alone, inhibited the anti-hypersensitivity

discussion

glutamate is the most ubiquitous excitatory neurotransmitter
in the central nervous system and its regulation by glutamate
transporters has been intensely investigated in the spinal cord
and brain. in the spinal cord, blockade of spinal glutamate
transporters induces hypersensitivity to mechanical and
thermal stimuli in normal rats (weng et al., 2006), whereas
activation or gene-transfer of  xxxg2103xxx  in the spinal cord reduces
hypersensitivity in rats after peripheral nerve injury and
inflammation (coderre et al., 2007; maeda et al., 2008). these
results suggest that glutamate transporters in the spinal cord
play critical roles in both physiological and pathological pain
states by reducing extracellular glutamate concentrations and
reducing pain neurotransmission.
activation of the lc results in noradrenaline release in the
spinal cord, which produces antinociception and anti-hypersensitivity activation of  xxxg831xxx  adrenoceptors. although descend-

ing inhibitory mechanisms have been investigated for several
decades (fields and basbaum, 1978), the regulation of descending modulation of pain transmission is poorly understood. glutamate is a primary excitatory neurotransmitter in
the lc (singewald and philippu, 1998), and one would
anticipate that activation of glutamate transporters in the lc
would reduce glutamatergic signaling, lc activity, and descending inhibition. in contrast, we observed in the present
study that intra-lc injection of glutamate transporter activator riluzole in nerve-injured rats reduced hypersensitivity and
that this likely reflected paradoxically increased neuronal
activity, since the anti-hypersensitivity effect which was
reversed by a spinally administered  xxxg831xxx  adrenoceptor antagonist. the effect of riluzole clearly involves glutamate availability and signaling, since both the anti-hypersensitivity and
lc neuronal activation, as evidenced by pcreb expression,
from riluzole were blocked by an  xxxg981xxx  antagonist.

riluzole is the only clinically approved drug for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with neuroprotective effects as a
glutamate modulator (brooks, 2009). in addition to activation
of glutamate transporters (frizzo et al., 2004; fumagalli et al.,
2008), high concentrations of riluzole (>10 mum) exert actions
on other targets, including inhibition of voltage-dependent
sodium channels (lamanauskas and nistri, 2008; urbani and
belluzzi, 2000; zona et al., 1998), high-voltage activated
calcium and potassium channels (huang et al., 1997; zona et
al., 1998), and glutamate receptors (albo et al., 2004; de sarro et
al., 2000). all of those effects of riluzole would induce neuronal
inhibition rather than activation. however, we did not observe
inhibition by riluzole (0.1–1 mum) in the lc in the current study,
but paradoxically observed activation of noradrenergic neurons in this nucleus via actions on ampa receptors. since
riluzole inhibits post-synaptic currents mediated by ampa
receptors in spinal motor neurons (albo et al., 2004), it is
unlikely that riluzole directly activates ampa receptors or
amplifies their signaling in noradrenergic neurons. we
therefore consider that riluzole increases extracellular glutamate concentrations in the lc to activate descending inhibition. although cultured astrocytes differ from the in vivo
conditions, the present study supports this idea that activation of glutamate transporters by riluzole enhances glutamate-induced glutamate release from astrocytes.
 xxxg2103xxx  and glast expressed in astrocytes take up glutamate
from the extracellular space under physiological conditions,
but during pathological states such as ischemia, perturbed
ionic conditions (e.g. increased extracellular k+ levels) can
increase extracellular glutamate concentrations through reverse transport (malarkey and parpura, 2008). however, since
riluzole activated lc neurons in brainstem slices from normal
animals in the present study, it is unlikely that riluzole induces
glutamate release via reverse transport. in astrocytes, ampa
receptors and group 1 mglurs are functionally important for
increased intracellular ca2+ concentration following exposure
to glutamate and the coincident activation of those receptors
produces a positive enhancement for ca2+ -dependent glutamate release (hansson et al., 2000; verkhratsky and kirchhoff,
2007). previous study in cerebellar astrocytes demonstrated
that co-transport of sodium ions and glutamate by glutamate
transporters results in the reverse mode of na/ca exchange to
increase intracellular ca2+ concentration (rojas et al., 2007),
suggesting that activation of glutamate transporters could
enhance ca2+ -dependent glutamate release by glutamate. we
therefore consider that riluzole may utilize this mechanism to
enhance glutamate-induced glutamate release by activation of
glutamate transporters.
in the lc, electrical coupling of neurons promotes synchronized spontaneous activity, which is blocked by cbx
(ballantyne et al., 2004). this indicates that gap junction
between lc neurons may be required for the maintenance of
endogenous rhythmic activity in the lc. several lines of
evidence also support an astrocyte-neuronal gap-junction
communication in the lc. as such, pharmacologic blockade of
gap junctions disrupted oscillations in both glial and neuronal
membrane potential in this structure, selective inhibition of
lc neuronal activity by a mu-opioid agonist coincidentally
reduced astrocyte membrane potential oscillations, and
selective depolarization of astrocytes with a glutamate

transporter substrate (l-aminoadipic acid) increased the
neuronal firing rate in the lc(alvarez-maubecin et al., 2000).
these observations indicate that activation of lc neurons and
astrocytes by glutamate can reciprocally increase their
activities via gap-junction connections and may result in
glutamate release from astrocytes. since most gap-junction
blockers have different non-selective effects (pan et al., 2007),
we used two structurally different gap-junction blockers, cbx
and mec, in the present study. both gap-junction blockers
reversed the anti-hypersensitivity effect of intra-lc riluzole
and cbx inhibited riluzole-induced neuronal activation in the
lc, suggesting riluzole's efficacy relies on neuro-neuro and/or
neuro-glia gap-junction connections. of course, the current
study does not identify the location of the gap junctions in the
lc relevant to riluzole's action. imaging or patch-clamp study
in astrocytes and lc neurons in a brainstem slice preparation
or in vivo would more directly address effects of riluzole on
neuronal activity and glutamate release from astrocytes.
future studies using such methods will be required.
in summary, the present study has demonstrated that
riluzole activates lc neurons via action on ampa receptors and
induces descending inhibition to reduce hypersensitivity in
nerve-injured rats, and that this paradoxical action of riluzole
may be due to facilitation of glutamate-induced glutamate
release from astrocytes and also requires neuro-neuro and/or
neuro-glia gap-junction connections in the lc. these results
suggest that riluzole is a useful probe to understand the local
regulation of glutamate in the lc to activate descending
noradrenergic inhibition and should be considered for clinical
investigation in patients with chronic pain.

experimental procedures

4.1.

animals

male sprague–dawley rats (weighing 180–250 g) from harlan
industries (indianapolis, in, usa) were used. all experiments
were approved by animal care and use committee at wake
forest university (winston salem, nc). animals were housed
under a 12-h light–dark cycle, with food and water ad libitum.

4.2.

surgical preparations

snl was performed as previously described (kim and chung,
1992). animals were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane, and the
right l5 and l6 spinal nerves were tightly ligated using 5-0 silk
suture. two weeks after snl, intra-lc and intrathecal
catheterization were performed as previously described
(hayashida et al., 2008; yaksh and rudy, 1976). under
anesthesia with intraperitoneal sodium pentobarbital
(50 mg/kg), animals were placed securely in a stereotaxic
frame (kopf, tujunga, ca). a sterile stainless steel guide
cannula (26-gauge needle shaft; plastics one, roanoke, va)
was implanted into the right lc. the coordinates for
placement of the tip of the guide cannula were 9.8 mm
posterior and 1.4 mm lateral to the bregma, and 7.0 mm
ventral from the surface of the dura mater, according to the rat
brain atlas (paxinos and watson, 2005). for intrathecal
catheterization, a polyethylene catheter (recathco llc,

br a in re s e a rch 1 3 17 ( 20 1 0 ) 8 0 –8 6

allison park, pa), 7.5 cm, was inserted to reach the lumbar
enlargement of the spinal cord. animals were allowed at least
5 days to recover from the surgery. after the experiment, rats
received a  xxxd2610xxx  (0.5 mul) into the lc and
killed by intraperitoneal pentobarbital (150 mg/kg) injection.
the brainstem was removed, post-fixed with 8% buffered
paraformaldehyde, and sectioned, and the placement of the
cannula was verified microscopically. in the 47 rats, 2 rats
were excluded from the study due to weight loss after surgery
and lc cannula misplacement.

4.3.

behavioral test

the person performing the behavioral test was blinded to drug
and dose. withdrawal threshold to pressure applied to the
hind paw was measured using an analgesimeter (ugo basile,
comerio, italy) as previously described (randall and selitto,
1957). the device applies increasing pressure to the hind paw.
when the animal withdrew the paw or vocalized, the pressure
was immediately released and the withdrawal threshold,
expressed in grams, was obtained. training of animals for
this test was performed for 2–3 days before the drug
treatment. a cut-off of 250 g was used to avoid potential
tissue injury. we used these animals two or three times on
different days and experiments in the same animals were
separated by at least 4 days. drugs and the doses were
randomly assigned. riluzole (sigma chemical co., st. louis,
mo),  xxxd433xxx  disodium (cbx, sigma), and meclofenamic acid sodium (mec, sigma) were dissolved in saline and
6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione disodium salt (cnqx2na, sigma) was dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx , and diluted
with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (in mm: nacl 126.0, kcl 2.5,
 xxxd2534xxx  1.3, cacl2 2.5, glucose 12, nah2po4 1.2, and nahco3 25).
a volume of 0.5 mul solution was injected into the lc at the
speed of 0.5 mul/min using a syringe pump (model 200, kd
scientific, holliston, ma) 15 min prior to the behavioral
measurement. for intrathecal administration, idazoxan hydrochloride (sigma chemical co.) was dissolved in saline and
injected in a volume of 10 mul followed by 10 mul of saline 30 min
prior to the measurement.

4.4.

brainstem slice study

brainstem slice experiments were performed as previously
reported (hayashida et al., 2008). under deep anesthesia with 5
% isoflurane, animals were killed by decapitation to remove
brainstem. transverse brainstem slices containing the lc
(600 mum thickness) were obtained from normal rats using a
vibratome (vt1000 s, leica mircosystems, nussloch, germany) and perfused in the chamber with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (2 ml/min, 37 ± 0.5 °c, 95% o2/5% co2 saturated). after
3 h of baseline perfusion, brainstem slices were transferred to
the drug challenge chamber and incubated with drugs for
30 min and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h. the
fixed tissues were then cryoprotected with 30% sucrose for
48 h and sectioned (16 mum). because of potential damage of
tissue, the first and last 7 sections from the tissue surface were
discarded and the rest were used for the immunocytochemistry. for dbetah and pcreb staining, 4 brainstem sections were
randomly selected from each animal. sections were pre-

85

treated with 1.5% normal donkey serum (nds, vector,
burlingame, ca) and then incubated for 24 h at 4°c with a
mouse monoclonal anti-dbetah antibody (1:1,000, mab308,
chemicon international inc., temecula, ca, usa) and a rabbit
anti-pcreb antibody (1:1,000, #06-519, upstate, lake placid,
ny) diluted in phosphate buffered saline containing 0.3%
triton-x 100 and 1.5% nds. subsequently, the sections were
incubated for 1 h with a donkey anti-mouse fluorscein (1:100,
chemicon international inc.) and then incubated with a
donkey anti-rabbit rhodamine (1:100, chemicon international
inc.). finally, dbetah and pcreb immunostaining was visualized
under an inverted microscope (200× magnifications) with
standard fitc and tritc filters. images of both sides of lcs
were captured using a digital ccd camera with a consistent
setting. cells with dbetah and pcreb immunostaining were
counted in the entire lcs in each section. in each animal, 83–
204 dbetah-immunoreactive lc cells with visible nuclei were
counted. the person performing immunohistochemistry and
counting cells was blinded to drug and treatment.

4.5.

glutamate release study

primary astrocyte cultures were prepared from brains from
neonatal rats between postnatal days 1 and 2 as previously
described (holtje et al., 2008) with minor modifications. after
removal of meninges, brains were mechanically dissociated in
ice-cold hank's buffered salt solution (hbss, ph 7.2) by firepolished glass pipettes and centrifuged at 240×g for 5 min.
tissues were redissociated in ice-cold hbss, and the procedure
was repeated two times using smaller pipette tip diameters.
cells were first seeded onto t-50 flasks and incubated in
dulbecco's modified eagle's medium, supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm
l-glutamine, and 10 ng/ml  xxxg681xxx  (egf, fisher
scientific, pittsburgh, pa, usa), included to maintain  xxxg2103xxx 
protein expression in astrocytes (zelenaia et al., 2000), at 37 °c
and 5% co2. microglial cells were detached from the astrocyte
monolayer by shaking and decanting. after 5 days in culture
with two changes of medium, astrocytes were harvested and
reseeded in 24-well plates at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well and
cultured for 48 h. glutamate release experiments were performed as previously described (holtje et al., 2008) with minor
modifications. astrocytes were incubated with krebs-hepes
buffer (in mm: nacl 140, kcl 4.7, cacl2 2.5,  xxxd2534xxx  1.2, and hepes
15, ph 7.4) containing 1 mum glutamate (combination of both
tritiated and unlabeled glutamate) for 1 h at 37 °c, and then
washed twice with krebs-hepes buffer. astrocytes were incubated with vehicle (saline) or riluzole (1 mum) in the presence of
unlabeled glutamate (0–100 mum) for 10 min at 37 °c. supernatants were collected and the amount of radioactivity was
measured by scintillation spectrometry. astrocytes were lysed
with 0.4% triton x-100 for 10 min at 42 °c and the amount of
radioactivity in lysates was measured by scintillation spectrometry. [3h]-glutamate release was presented as a percentage of
total radioactivity (supernatant and lysates) in each well.
