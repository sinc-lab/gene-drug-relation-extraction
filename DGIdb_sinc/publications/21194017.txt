abstract
purpose the purpose of this review is to summarize
current knowledge of detailed biochemical evidence for the
role of c- xxxd2177xxx  type a receptors (gabaa–rs)
in the mechanisms of general anesthesia.
principal findings with the knowledge that all general
anesthetics positively modulate gabaa-r-mediated inhibitory transmission, site-directed mutagenesis comparing
sequences of gabaa-r subunits of varying sensitivity led
to identification of amino acid residues in the transmembrane domain that are critical for the drug actions in vitro.
using a photo incorporable analogue of the general
anesthetic, r(?)etomidate, we identified two transmembrane amino acids that were affinity labelled in purified
bovine brain gabaa-r. homology protein structural
modelling positions these two residues, am1-11’ and bm3-4’,
close to each other in a single type of intersubunit etomidate binding pocket at the b/a interface. this position
would be appropriate for modulation of agonist channel
gating. overall, available information suggests that these
two etomidate binding residues are allosterically coupled
to sites of action of steroids, barbiturates, volatile agents,
and propofol, but not alcohols. residue a/bm2-15’ is
probably not a binding site but allosterically coupled to

and a/bm1-(-2’) is coupled to action of intravenous agents.
conclusions establishment of a coherent and consistent
structural model of the gabaa-r lends support to the
conclusion that general anesthetics can modulate function
by binding to appropriate domains on the protein. genetic
engineering of mice with mutation in some of these
gabaa-r residues are insensitive to general anesthetics in
vivo, suggesting that further analysis of these domains
could lead to development of more potent and specific
drugs.

the purpose of this review is to inform the reader of the
current knowledge of detailed biochemical evidence for the
role of c- xxxd2177xxx  type a receptors (gabaa–rs)
in the mechanisms of anesthesia. we briefly summarize the
evidence connecting anesthetic action on the brain with
action on gabaa-rs and the structure and function of
gabaa-rs. we describe the major techniques utilized for
determination of amino acids and sequence domains within
proteins that participate in various functions, and we
summarize the newest data developed on the study of
gabaa-rs to identify such sites. we also discuss how the
overall data for all the chemical classes of general anesthetics either form or do not form a coherent story for a role
for gabaa-rs in anesthetic action and its relevance for
the future of clinical anesthesiology.
most drugs that act as general anesthetics act only at
relatively high concentrations, and their interaction with
biosystems has long been considered as more of a physical
interaction, namely, perturbation of fluidity of the membrane lipid bilayer, which is consistent with the meyeroverton correlation. in this correlation, potency as a general
anesthetic is directly related to the solubility ratio for the
compound in an oil-water mixture rather than to chemically
specific binding to recognition sites on the molecules
involved, as in traditional drug receptors.1 however, recent
electrophysiological studies on specificity of action of
anesthetic agents on biosystems and biochemical investigations on specific interactions with proteins, especially
membrane channels, suggest that general anesthetics probably act via hydrophobic regions of protein targets in

207

neurons.2,3 a major candidate for the target of general
anesthetics is the gabaa receptor, a ligand-gated chloride
ion channel receptor for the neurotransmitter gaba, which
universally inhibits neuronal excitability via synaptic phasic
currents as well as extrasynaptic tonic currents.4-7 the
gabaa -rs are actually a family of heteropentamers with
differing subunit composition that vary in their agedependence and brain and subcellular localization of
expression and trafficking, as well as their pharmacological
specificity, including sensitivity to gaba agonists and
allosteric modulators, such as benzodiazepines, general
anesthetics, neurosteroids, and ethanol (etoh).8,9

general anesthetic action and gabaa-rs
most if not all general anesthetics at relevant concentrations
enhance the function of gabaa-rs, and gabaa-rs are
positioned in the nervous system where they can mediate
anesthesia.3,7,10-12 people have used the differential sensitivity of gabaa-r subunits to anesthetic modulation,
especially the low sensitivity of q subtypes, to attempt to
identify amino acid residues in the gabaa-r subunit
sequences that are critical for anesthetic modulation.13,14
the residues implicated are in or near the transmembrane
domains. virtually all of the chemical classes of adrugs with
general anesthetic activity are implicated, including especially all of the intravenously administered agents, such as,
etomidate, propofol, barbiturates, steroids, and alcohols, as
well as the volatile gaseous agents. some of these transmembrane gabaa-r residues have been mutated in
knock-in mice, which subsequently lose sensitivity to general anesthetics, thus verifying the important role of
gabaa-rs in anesthetic action.12

alcohol action and gabaa-rs
ethanol does enhance gabaa-rs and glycine receptors,
much like longer chain alcohols (e.g., n-octanol), but at
very high (anesthetic) concentrations. we need to distinguish between these anesthetic effects of high-dose etoh
and longer chain alcohols and the intoxicating effects of
lower doses, such as those encountered in the human brain
during social drinking, because evidence suggests that
effects of low- and high-dose etoh involve (at least) two
distinct targets in the brain. we suggest that these receptors
that are sensitive to etoh levels resulting from one glass
of wine (3-30 mm) are certain subtypes of gabaa-r, the
d subunit-containing extrasynaptic gabaa-r that mediate
tonic inhibition.15,16 one major target of anesthetic doses
of etoh (30-100 mm) is in the transmembrane domain of
gabaa-rs and glycine receptors.13,17,18

123

208

evidence suggests that etoh has a second site of
interaction with gabaa-r that is relevant to its pharmacological actions at low doses as produced in humans by
one glass of wine.16 studies on a naturally-occurring allele
in the rat gabaa-r a6 subunit suggests that the residue,
a4/6r100, is involved in etoh action as well as its
blockade by the benzodiazepine ligand, ro15-4513.17,19,20
these results are consistent with our observations that the
a4/6b3d subtypes of gabaa-r are more sensitive to etoh
(low mm) than other subtypes, including the c2 subunit or
the b1/2 subunits.15 moreover, this is consistent with the
observation by many that etoh at low mm concentrations
enhances gabaa-r-mediated tonic inhibitory currents in
cells expressing the d gabaa-r subunit.19,21-23 this
hypothesis remains controversial,24 as the expression of
recombinant d subunits is very difficult and thus hardly
studied, and the brain slice/neuron work is still in its
infancy; however, we believe the hypothesis will be
accepted as it becomes better understood. our preliminary
investigations of domains within the b3 and d subunits
that interact in a4/6b3d subtypes implicate residues in the
b3 subunit that are homologous to the benzodiazepine
binding site involving ar100, which produces an etohsensitive binding site for certain benzodiazepines, like
ro15-4513, that would be located at the a?/b- interface in
the extracellular domain. future work will determine
whether this model has any basis in reality.

methods for identification of amino acids involved
in specific functions of proteins, including allosteric
modulators

an analogue of the anesthetic containing a sulfhydryl
reagent to the cysteine-substituted candidate residue.25-27
affinity labelling
the use of affinity labels is more likely to identify residues
involved in a binding pocket, because the ligand has to
have reasonable affinity for the target protein and a
chemical group that will bind the protein covalently. the
ligand will label residues in close contact when it is bound
to the receptor. to maximize specificity, the chemically
reactive group is often stable until chemically activated,
e.g., by ultraviolet light.28 nevertheless, some uncertainty
arises from possible movement of the activated ligand from
the binding site to nearby areas, depending on its lifetime
and relative reactivity. thus, additional evidence consistent
with identification of the labelled residues as binding site
constituents is also useful here. making the affinity label
radioactive can allow identification of the subunit polypeptide-carrying binding sites on sds gels and can aid in
sequencing the peptide. this binding must be prevented by
excess non-radioactive ligand, and its relevance to the drug
receptor can be supported by evidence of allosteric modulation of its binding by other receptor ligands. another
advantage of affinity labelling is the fact that the results are
unbiased by having to guess in advance which residues
might be important, as required with mutagenesis. we
succeeded in using this technique for anesthetic binding to
gabaa-r.29

major findings
site-directed mutagenesis results

chimeras and site-directed mutagenesis
an often utilized and frequently successful technique is to
compare polypeptide sequences of homologous subunits
showing varying sensitivity to drugs. for example, mihic
et al.13 compared glycine receptors (sensitive to isoflurane
and high-dose etoh) with gabaa-r q subunits (insensitive to these modulators). one makes chimeric cdnas
that differ in the domain of interest and determine which
residues are critical. this is followed by site-directed point
mutations in suspected residues until the critical one(s) is
identified. on the negative side, identification of residues
that determine modulatory drug sensitivity by mutagenesis
alone may be allosterically coupled to the function rather
than involved in binding per se. thus, the initial observation requires confirmation by secondary approaches. this
could involve studying a number of mutations for the
implicated residue to discover the shape and properties the
‘‘pocket’’ might show, or attempting a covalent couple of

wingrove et al. (1994)30 found that modulation of gabar
by the anticonvulsant/anxiolytic loreclezole depended on
the nature of the b subunit (b2/b3  b1). belelli et al.
(1997)31 extended this b subunit selectivity to the intravenous anesthetic, etomidate, a chemical analogue of
loreclezole, and demonstrated that the b selectivity was due
to residue 265, which is n in both b2 and b3 (sensitive to
etomidate) and differed from b1 (s, insensitive to etomidate) as well as the insect b (rdl, which has m, insensitive
to etomidate). they31 showed that a single amino acid in
gabaa-r, b2n265, (bm2-15’) was responsible for the
selectivity of b2 and b3 over b1 for the modulatory drugs,
loreclezole and etomidate. this b selectivity was found to
extend to the related intravenous anesthetic, propofol.32
mihic et al. (1997)13 used the anesthetic-insensitive
gabaa-r q subunit sequence and the anesthetic-sensitive
 xxxg904xxx  a and gabar a and b subunits to identify, by construction of chimeras and point mutations, some

gabaa receptors and allosteric modulation

amino acid residues critical for modulation of glyr and
gabaa-r by volatile anesthetics and long-chain alcohols,
implicating the m2-15’ and m3-4’ residues in both the a
and b subunits of gabaa-r. note that the m2-15’ residue
is the same as the one found simultaneously by belelli
et al. (1997).31
carlson et al. (2000)14 took a similar approach to
identify a single amino acid at the entrance to m1(-2’) in
gabaa-r a and b, i.e., b2g229, which when mutated to
larger (e.g., f as in q) or charged residues gave significantly reduced sensitivity to modulation of binding and
function by steroids, etomidate, propofol, and barbiturates,
with enhanced direct gating by these drugs. thus, it
appeared that larger than normal amino acids at this position took the place of anesthetics in partially enhancing
gaba, so that the extent of enhancement by the exogenous anesthetic ligand was reduced.
in addition to the residues identified by mihic et al.
(1997)13 for anesthetic doses of etoh enhancement of
glycine receptors (transmembrane a1s267[m2-15’]), daryl
davies and ron alkana found that residues in the extracellular domain loop 2 (a1a52) are also needed33 and
proposed to be in the same pocket as m2-15’. these workers
also went on to show that modification of loop 2 in glycine
receptor a1 subunits or in gabaa-r c2 subunit, such as
replacement by the loop 2 10-residue peptide fragment from
the gabaa-r d subunit, increases etoh sensitivity about
tenfold, as measured in oocyte recordings.34
hosie et al. (2006)35 constructed chimeras replacing steroid-sensitive a1 and b2 subunits of the gabaa-r m1 – m2
residues with those from the steroid-insensitive insect rdl
clone; this reduced steroid modulation, potentiation of
gaba, and direct activation of abc receptors when a1 was
mutated, but not b2. steroid modulation was shown to depend
on the nature of several residues in the transmembrane helix.
they provided evidence that a1q242(m1-10’) and a1n408
and y411 in m4 (bovine numbering)36 could provide anchor
points to bind the two ends of the steroid molecule. also,
a1t237(m1-5’) (bovine numbering) and by284 were shown
to be essential for direct activation, and protein structural
modelling suggested that they were located near each other in
a single intersubunit pocket at the bm3-am1 interface.35 this
possible model is discussed further below.

mouse knock-ins
the results of belelli et al. (1997)31 led to the production of
knock-in mice with point mutations in this single gabaa-r
subunit bm2-15’ residue. both the b2n265s (replaced with
the b1 residue),37 which showed less sensitivity to the sedative action of etomidate, and the b3n265 m (replaced with
the anesthetic-insensitive insect residue),38 which showed

209

less sensitivity to the immobilization action of etomidate
and propofol, provided strong evidence for the role of
gabaa-rs in anesthetic action. furthermore,  xxxg220xxx 
composition-dependent pharmacology was established,
presumably due to an anatomical correlate of anesthetic
sensitivity. in other words, the b3-containing gabaa-rs
and the circuits in which they function are involved in the
anesthetic actions of etomidate, while the b2-containing
gabaa-rs are not but are involved in some of the sedative
and other actions of etomidate; b1-containing gabaa-rs
are not involved in anesthetic actions of etomidate.12
harrison et al. went on to test the a1s270h mutation in
knock-in mice for reduced sensitivity to anesthetics. hall
et al. (2004)39 found a reduced sensitivity to isoflurane in
enhancing gabaa-r current, with increased probability of
opening for the mutant channels in absence of anesthetic.
elsen et al. (2006)40 found altered responses to volatile
anesthetics in vivo, including reduced time of anesthesia and
abnormal seizure-like behaviours on coming out of anesthesia. this is not strong evidence for an anesthetic site of
action. however, the a1s270h (m2-15’) knock-in mice had
a sickly phenotype, interpreted as likely due to the left-shift
in the gaba dose-response curve and a corresponding
excessive gabaergic inhibition in vivo.39 a compensatory
second knock-in point mutation, a1l277a, introduced into
the s270h mouse restored normal neuronal and in vivo
excitability levels, normal gaba sensitivity, and normal
health41 and allowed demonstration that these animals
exhibited less than normal responses in some assays of volatile anesthetic42 and high (anesthetic)- dose etoh effects.43

affinity labelling with azietomidate
we have used the technique of photoaffinity labelling,
synthesizing a photo-incorporable analogue of etomidate
with anesthetic efficacy, r(?)azietomidate, and then
radiolabelling it.44 this ligand [3h]azietomidate was successfully employed to photolabel benzodiazepine affinitypurified gabaa-r proteins from cow brain and identify
two amino acids as sites of attachment.29 the team led by
keith miller at massachusetts general hospital synthesized a photo-incorporable anesthetic, r(?)azietomidate, a
close analogue of etomidate, and demonstrated both bioactivity as well as photoaffinity labelling capability.44
using detergent-solubilized membranes that retained the
allosteric modulation of gabaa-r radioligand binding by
etomidate, the richard olsen lab purified to homogeneity
the gabaa-r protein from bovine cerebral cortex and
photoaffinity labelled the pooled protein (several hundred
pmol) with [3h]azietomidate, leading to a single peak of
radioactive protein at ca. 55 kda, which was shown by
mass spectrometry and western blotting to contain

gabaa-r a1, a2, a3, a5, b1, b2, b3, and c2 (and a trace of
a4) subunits. edman degradation microsequencing of proteolytic fragments purified on high performance liquid
chromotogrpahy (hplc) by the jon cohen lab allowed
identification of the labelled amino acids. the residues that
were labelled do not appear to be nonspecifically tagged.
the same results have now been obtained on numerous
occasions; alkyl azides are not particularly reactive with
met residues, and several more reactive residues as well as
two other methionines in the region near our two identified
amino acids were not reactive.
the residues labelled were m236 in the m1 domain of
the alpha subunits (a1, 2, 3, and 5 were all the same in the
relevant peptides) and m286 in the m3 domain of the beta
subunits (also identical in b1, 2, and 3). the attachment
sites for etomidate were thus identified as am1-11’ (m236)
and bm3-4’ (m286) (table 1).29 the latter is the same as
one of the two identified by mihic et al. for anesthetic
alcohols and volatile agents.13 the former had not been
described previously for anesthetic interactions. figure 1
shows a 3-d model of the heteropentameric gabaa-r with
the gaba and bz sites at subunit interfaces in the extracellular domain and etomidate sites in the transmembrane
domain.29 the bz sites are modified gaba sites located at
a different subunit interface, that is, homologous residues
corresponding to agonist binding pocket loops in the protein
at the two b/a interfaces for gaba binding are involved in
bz binding at the single a/c interface.8,11,45

interaction of other general anesthetics
with azietomidate labelling sites
the table summarizes the studies with other chemical
classes of general anesthetics. the intravenous agent,

propofol, with a very similar pharmacological profile was
able to inhibit the labelling of gabaa-r with azietomidate
at anesthetic concentrations, but only partially, even when
present in large excess over the etomidate. this partial
inhibition was evident on both labelled residues, as shown by
sequencing. the binding is not mutually exclusive, although
it could involve overlapping sites. we conclude that it indicates an allosteric interaction.46 a similar partial inhibition
was seen for a series of pharmacologically active barbiturates, also apparently allosteric.46 in addition, the anesthetic
neurosteroids at appropriate concentrations did not inhibit
azietomidate labelling but rather enhanced it. this proves
that the steroid site does not coincide with the etomidate
binding pocket and interacts allosterically.36 on the other
hand, the volatile agent, isoflurane, showed a smooth inhibition curve down to zero and thus could possibly reflect
competitive inhibition. however, the alcohols, n-octanol
(10-1000 lm) and etoh (1-1000 mm), failed to interact
with azietomidate labelling, neither enhancing nor inhibiting.46 we have suggested another site for pharmacological
actions of etoh at low concentrations on gabaa-r.16

homology modelling
computer-enhanced electron microscope images of the
torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor47 and the watersoluble acetylcholine binding protein48 allowed homology
modelling of the gabaa-r and positioned the two
etomidate labelled residues sufficiently close to each other
´
(about 10 å) in the transmembrane domain to allow us to
propose a single binding pocket at the interface between
am1 and bm3 (li et al., 2006,29 electronic supplementary
material). this intersubunit etomidate binding pocket
(fig. 2) would be present in two (identical) copies per

pentamer at the same subunit interfaces (b?/a-) where
gaba binding occurs in the extracellular domain. this
seems a suitable position for allosteric modulation, especially relevant to the quaternary twist allosteric model for
the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel receptors.49 the
presence of only one kind of etomidate site29 suggests that
both enhancement of gaba and direct gating by etomidate
involve this one site. this is consistent with modelling of
functional data following the monod-wyman-changeux
2-state allosteric model.50
jansen & akabas51 used ‘‘cysteine scanning accessibility
measurements’’ and cross-linking to align the m2 and m3
helices of the  xxxg456xxx  and used
homology gabaar to allow a fixed setting of the helical
wheels relevant to our proposed etomidate site.29,36 bali
et al.52 continued in this vein using cysteine substituents to
align the m1 and m3 helices of gabaar, refining the
helical wheel orientations (fig. 1c). this showed our two
etomidate residues, am1-11’ and bm3-4’, to be very close
and consistent with a single intersubunit anesthetic binding
pocket at the a/b interface. one can also see that the bm2-15’
is not directly adjacent to the etomidate binding pocket but
also is not very distant, and so it could possibly move into
closer contact with am1-11’ and bm3-4’. on the other hand,
the two residues implicated in steroid direct gating action35

(fig. 1c) are on different sides of the helices and could not be
part of a single binding pocket due to the distance between
them. those residues implicated in steroid enhancement of
gaba are not shown on this helix but would not overlap
with the etomidate enhancement site we defined.

biochemistry and electrophysiological testing of models
derived from residue identification and modelling
work in the lab of harrison25 as a follow-up to mihic
et al.13 showed that the gabaa-r am2-15’ involvement
for volatiles was sensitive to the volume of the amino acid
at that position, consistent with a binding pocket. followup work in the lab of harris26 showed that an alcohol
sulfhydryl analogue, propanethiol, could be covalently
attached to am2-15’ when substituted by cysteine, leading
to persistent enhancement of gaba responses. this was
even more dramatically demonstrated for b2m2-15’, which
could be modified by the alcohol, octane methanethiosulfonate, when mutated to cysteine to produce a covalent
attachment showing irreversible potentiation53 consistent
with a long-chain alcohol binding site. the binding of the
octanol analogue could be inhibited by n-octanol, and the
modification was able to alter modulation of gaba

function by butanol and isoflurane, with some reduction of
modulation by alphaxalone and flunitrazepam, but not
pentobarbital.53 homology modelling in which gabaa-r
transmembrane helices were aligned, as found in the  xxxg456xxx ,47 suggested that these two
residues, a or b m2-15’ and m3-4’, could be found in a
single intrasubunit pocket.13,18 this supports the idea that
the m2-15’ residue could be a binding site for long-chain
alcohols and maybe volatile agents and could be sensitive
to allosteric modulation by etomidate, propofol, and possibly other anesthetics. however, residues identified by
mutagenesis alone could also be involved ‘‘merely’’ in
allosteric transduction.
work in the lab of olsen as follow-up to carlson et al.
(2000)14 found mutations at this m1 residue, a or bm1
(-2’), to alter rates of desensitization to gaba agonists and
allosteric modulators.54 mutations of b2m1(-2’) to a series
of residues differing in volume showed altered gating

kinetics consistent with a binding pocket.55 these mutagenesis studies also showed distinctive effects on
anesthetic direct gating vs enhancement of gaba, consistent with two separate sites of action. however, the lack
of chemical specificity for the modulators involved is more
consistent with an allosteric transduction site than a binding pocket.
mutagenesis analysis of the two etomidate binding residues of li et al. (2006)29 has been studied by our lab56 and
collaborator, stu forman. the first study replaced am236
or bm286 with trp. either mutation led to reduced allosteric modulation of gaba by etomidate, with increased
spontaneous openings, gaba left-shift, and increased
direct gating by etomidate,57 which we interpret as being
consistent but not conclusive with the theory that the residues are in a binding pocket. the second study replaced
the two etomidate residues with cysteine. with radioligand
binding, we found that large but not small sulfhydryl
reagents reacted with the a1m236 (m1-11’) in a manner
that irreversibly prevented etomidate modulation of
gabaa-r ligand binding; furthermore, the reaction with
the sulfhydryl reagents was protected by excess etomidate
in the tube.56 stewart & forman (2009)58 used electrophysiology with a1b2c2 gabaa-r to show that mutation
b2m286c (m3-4’) and b2n265c (m2-15’) could react
with the sulfhydryl reagent, p-cl mercuribenzene sulfonate, to eliminate etomidate modulation of channel
function, but that excess etomidate protected the m286
residue, but not the n265 residue, from reaction with the
sulfhydryl reagent. this is consistent with the etomidate
residues identified by affinity labelling as being part of an
anesthetic binding pocket.

summary of residues in gabaa-rs identified
as necessary for anesthetic action
homology modelling with the data of unwin47 as a template suggested that the two etomidate binding residues
could be part of a single class (two copies per pentamer) of
intersubunit binding pocket (fig. 2).29 this is also consistent with a single site for etomidate direct gating and
modulation of gaba current, as suggested by rüsch et al.
(2004).50 crosslinking studies of cysteine-substituted
helical residues in the akabas lab51,52 were totally consistent with this model, because residues that can crosslink
between am1 and bm3 position our etomidate residues,
am236 and bm286, nearly adjacent to each other
(fig. 1c).29,36 the transmembrane intersubunit pocket
(fig. 2) appears well situated to allosterically modulate the
quaternary twist conformational change produced to gate
the channel after binding of agonist to its site in the same b/

directly above (fig. 1). nevertheless, the general anesthetics,  xxxd1844xxx , halothane, and propofol, were shown to
inhibit channel function59 of another pentameric ligandgated ion channel, the bacterial  xxxd2202xxx  channel,60 and
binding of these anesthetics was shown in x-ray crystal
structures to occur at intrasubunit pockets in the transmembrane domain (p-j corringer, mac2010 symposium).
the intersubunit pocket between bm3 and am1 for
etomidate seems highly likely at this point. it remains
unclear whether the other residue labelled by mihic et al.
(1997)13 at m2-15’ is part of this pocket. this residue was
not affinity labelled by azietomidate. in our structural
model, it is located sufficiently close to potentially participate in the binding pocket (fig. 1c).29,36 nevertheless,
cysteine substitution of the three residues and inactivation
by cysteine reagents revealed that etomidate occupancy
was able to protect the cysteine reaction at a1m236c and
b2m286c, but not at b2n265c, suggesting that the first
two residues, but not the last, are in the etomidate binding
pocket.58 this had been suggested earlier by bali &
akabas61 who showed that propofol occupancy could
protect from cysteine reagent inactivation at am286c, but
not at an265c. the m2-15’ residue is clearly very
important for anesthetic action. if it is part of the intersubunit pocket (am1/bm2/bm3), it is unlikely that it would
also be part of an intrasubunit pocket (am1/am2/am3 or
bm1/bm2/bm3), but this remains to be seen. it could differ
for the different chemical classes of general anesthetics.
there is evidence26 that  xxxd3026xxx  can bind to the am2-15’
and octanol53 can bind to the bm2-15’, but these compounds do not interact with the etomidate binding residues,
am1-11’ and bm3-4’ (li et al.).
hosie et al.35 identified residues in am1 and  xxxd788xxx  needed for neurosteroid enhancement of gabaa-r and two
residues in am1 and bm3 needed for direct steroid gating,
which were proposed to be part of a single intersubunit
anesthetic steroid site. however, those two residues are not
positioned near each other in the helical wheels generated
by models of the intersubunit etomidate site consistent with
the cysteine substitution cross-linking data29,52 and consistent with our demonstration that the gabaa-r steroid
ligands do not inhibit azietomidate labelling but rather
enhance the binding in a pharmacologically specific manner.36 our study of additional chemical classes of general
anesthetics (table 1) showed that propofol inhibited azietomidate labelling, but only partially, and thus probably
allosterically.46 likewise, barbiturates partially inhibited
azietomidate labelling in a pharmacologically and stereospecific manner, thus were probably allosteric. the volatile
agent, isoflurane, gave a complete and possibly competitive
inhibition of azietomidate labelling, while two alcohols,
n-octanol and etoh, at pharmacologically active concentrations gave no inhibition or enhancement of azietomidate

labelling of brain gabaa-r.46 taken together, the data on
[3h]azietomidate labelling suggest that we have directly
identified amino acids in the contact point and binding
pocket for a general anesthetic in a relevant biological
target of action, the gabaa-r protein in the mammalian
brain. this information and future studies on the topic
should provide a path to development of safer, more
effective, and more selective general anesthetics.
