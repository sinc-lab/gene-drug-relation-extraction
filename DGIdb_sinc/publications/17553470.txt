suggesting that direct 5-ht1ar and da receptor interactions may contribute to the unique
profile of 5-ht1ar agonists for the improvement of pd treatment.

introduction

parkinson’s disease (pd) is a neurodegenerative disease
associated with degeneration of dopamine (da) neurons in
the substantia nigra pars compacta (mink, 1996), leading to
loss of da in the striatum. as a result, pd patients experience
motor deficits, such as resting tremor, rigidity and slowness of
movement. the standard treatment for pd consists of da
replacement therapy using  xxxd2471xxx  (ldopa). unfortunately, over time l-dopa loses its efficacy and
deleterious side effects appear. one such side effect is l-dopainduced dyskinesia (lid), characterized by abnormal and
excessive movements, appearing in 40% of pd patients after
4–5 years of treatment and 90% of patients after 9–15 years
(stocchi et al., 1997; ahlskog and muenter, 2001).
although the precise mechanisms of lid remain unknown,
there is evidence to suggest that it is a result of the development
of supersensitive striatal d1 (d1r) and d2 ( xxxg656xxx ) receptors
following da depletion (ungerstedt, 1971; breese et al., 1987;
miller and beninger, 1991). for example, repeated exposure of da
receptor agonists increase striatal signal transduction, gene
expression and da-mediated behaviors to an extent not
portrayed in intact animals (berke et al., 1998; cai et al., 2002;
bishop and walker, 2003). moreover, chronic treatment with d1r
and  xxxg656xxx  agonists can induce dyskinesia in both experimental
models of pd and human pd patients (rinne, 1989; rascol et al.,
2000; taylor et al., 2006). thus it is not surprising that d1r and
 xxxg656xxx  antagonists reduce lid; however, the anti-parkinsonian
benefit of l-dopa is also squelched making the identification of
nondopaminergic adjuncts to l-dopa a paramount goal (boyce
et al., 1990; monville et al., 2005; taylor et al., 2005).
in recent years,  xxxg1108xxx  (5-ht1ar) agonists have
emerged as promising supplements to l-dopa therapy. for
example, in animal models of pd, the full 5-ht1ar agonist (±)8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino)tetralin hydrobromide (±8-ohdpat) has been shown to decrease rotational behavior and
the frequency with which animals fail to respond to l-dopa
administration (tomiyama et al., 2005; ba et al., 2006), while
the partial 5-ht1ar agonist buspirone and the full 5-ht1ar
agonist sarizotan reduce lid while concurrently improving
the efficacy of l-dopa treatment (bibbiani et al., 2001). adjunct
5-ht1ar pharmacotherapy also demonstrates beneficial
effects in clinical studies. buspirone, sarizotan and the partial
5-ht1ar agonist tandospirone have been reported to convey
anti-dyskinetic effects in pd patients (bonifati et al., 1994;
kannari et al., 2002; bara-jimenez et al., 2005).
despite the clear potential for more widespread uses of
5-ht1ar agonists, the mechanism by which these com-

pounds produce their anti-parkinsonian and anti-dyskinetic
effects remains unknown. it has been postulated that under
conditions of severe da depletion, 5-ht1ar agonists may act at
the level of the dorsal raphe, where l-dopa-derived da release
may be modulated by extant somatodendritic 5-ht1ar (arai et
al., 1996; tanaka et al., 1999). more recently, evidence has
implicated that 5-ht1ar agonists might also directly influence
da receptor-mediated behaviors. for example, matsubara et
al. (2006) reported that the partial 5-ht1ar agonist tandospirone augmented contralateral rotations induced by the d1/
 xxxg656xxx  agonist apomorphine, while iravani et al. (2006) demonstrated that the potent 5-ht1ar agonist + 8-oh-dpat reduced
d2/ xxxg657xxx -mediated motor behaviors. accordingly, alternative extra-raphe mechanisms may account for these effects
at da receptors.
therefore, in order to better understand the influence of
5-ht1ar stimulation on da receptor-mediated behaviors, the
current study examined the effects of the 5-ht1ar agonist, ± 8oh-dpat, prior to l-dopa, the d1r agonist skf81297 and the
 xxxg656xxx  agonist quinpirole. using the abnormal involuntary
movements (aims) rodent model of lid and drug-induced
rotations as measures, we predicted that 5-ht1ar stimulation
would differentially modify da receptor-mediated behaviors,
which would signify discrete interactions between 5-ht1ar
and supersensitive da receptors.

monoamine and metabolite levels

the effects of the 6-ohda lesion on concentrations of
monoamine and metabolite levels and turnover ratios (metabolite/monoamine) in the intact (right) versus lesioned (left)
striata are shown in table 1. as anticipated, unilateral 6-ohda
injection into the medial forebrain bundle produced significant reductions in lesioned striatal dopac (t8 = 6.48; p < 0.001)
and da levels (t8 = 8.46; p < 0.001), 92.8% and 97.4% respectively,
compared to intact striatum. the denervated side also showed
an increased dopac/da turnover rate (+180%) compared to
control (t8 = 14.12; p < 0.001). there were no significant differences between intact and lesioned striata for any other
monoamine measures.

5 min prior to vehicle ( xxxd1896xxx ; dmso) administration. initial analysis of ±8-oh-dpat revealed main
effects of ±8-oh-dpat on alo aims at the 10th min
(p < 0.05). however, no specific treatment effects were found
following post hoc analysis. analyses of the effects of ±8oh-dpat on contralateral rotations revealed no main
effects of treatment, time or treatment × time interaction
(data not shown).

2.3.
effects of ±8-oh-dpat on l-dopa-induced alo aims
and rotations
upon analysis, main effects of ± 8-oh-dpat on l-dopainduced alo aims were found from min 20–120 (all p < 0.05).
as displayed in fig. 2a, post hoc analyses further revealed that
the high dose of ±8-oh-dpat (1.0 mg/kg) significantly reduced
alo aims from the 20th to 120th min compared to vehicle,
and from the 50th to 90th min, as well as the 110th and 120th
min compared to the low dose of ±8-oh-dpat (0.1 mg/kg). the
low dose of ±8-oh-dpat (0.1 mg/kg) significantly reduced alo
aims at the 20th, 30th, and 50th min compared to vehicle (all
p < 0.05).
analyses of the effects of ± 8-oh-dpat on l-dopa-induced
contralateral rotations revealed main effects of treatment
(f(2,11) = 6.39; p < 0.009), time (f(2,11) = 12.61; p < 0.001) and notably a significant interaction between treatment and time
(f(22,176) = 3.08; p < 0.001). post hoc analysis of this interaction,
as shown in fig. 2b, revealed that the high dose of ±8-ohdpat (1.0 mg/kg) decreased rotations at the 20th, 30th, 40th,
60th, and 80th min compared to vehicle, and from the 40th
to 80th min compared to the low dose of ±8-oh-dpat
(0.1 mg/kg). the low dose of ± 8-oh-dpat (0.1 mg/kg)
decreased rotations at the 20th min and increased rotations
at the 50th and 70th min compared to vehicle (all p < 0.05).

2.4.
effects of ± 8-oh-dpat on d1 agonist-induced alo
aims and rotations
main effects of ± 8-oh-dpat on d1r agonist skf81297induced alo aims were found at min 20–70 (all p < 0.05). as
shown in fig. 3a, post hoc analyses of these significant effects
revealed that the high dose of ± 8-oh-dpat (1.0 mg/kg)
significantly reduced alo aims at the 20th, 30th, 40th, and
60th min compared to vehicle, and from the 30th to 70th min
compared to the low dose of ±8-oh-dpat (0.1 mg/kg; all
p < 0.05).
the effects of ± 8-oh-dpat on d1r agonist-induced
contralateral rotations revealed no main effect of treatment
but a main effect of time (f(2,11) = 41.91; p < 0.001). more
importantly, a significant interaction between treatment
and time was found (f(22,176) = 2.36; p < 0.001). subsequent
post hoc analysis of this interaction, demonstrated in fig. 3b,
revealed that the high dose ± 8-oh-dpat (1.0 mg/kg)
increased skf81297-induced rotations from the 20th to
120th min compared to vehicle, and from the 30th to
100th min compared to the low dose of ± 8-oh-dpat
(0.1 mg/kg) while the low dose of ±8-oh-dpat (0.1 mg/kg)
significantly increased skf81297-induced rotations at the
40th min compared to vehicle (all p < 0.05).

2.5.
effects of ±8-oh-dpat on d2 agonist-induced alo
aims and rotations
analyses revealed main effects of ±8-oh-dpat on  xxxg656xxx  agonist
quinpirole-induced alo aims at min 30 and 60 (both p < 0.05).
post hoc analyses of these significant effects (fig. 4a) revealed
that the high dose of ±8-oh-dpat (1.0 mg/kg) decreased alo
aims at the 30th and 60th min compared to vehicle, and the
low dose of ±8-oh-dpat (0.1 mg/kg) decreased alo aims at
the 30th min compared to vehicle (all p < 0.05). as shown in
fig. 4b, analyses of the effects of ±8-oh-dpat on  xxxg656xxx  agonistinduced contralateral rotations revealed no main effects of
treatment, time or treatment × time interaction.

discussion

in the present study we demonstrate that 5-ht1ar stimulation influences a diverse number of da-mediated behaviors
within the hemiparkinsonian rat. these effects were
directly related to the receptor actions of the compounds
tested and the behaviors that were monitored. the 5-ht1a
agonist, ±8-oh-dpat, dose dependently reduced aims and
altered contralateral rotations induced by l-dopa treatment.
in contrast, 5-ht1ar stimulation dose dependently attenuated aims induced by d1r stimulation but significantly
augmented d1r-induced contralateral rotations. finally,
 xxxg656xxx -induced aims but not contralateral rotations were
reduced by 5-ht1ar stimulation. the current results implicate an important functional interaction between d1, d2
and 5-ht1a receptors that may have important clinical
implications for direct and indirect da agonist treatment
of pd.
the unilateral 6-ohda rat model of pd has proven
extremely useful for the study of pd, including l-dopainduced side effects like lid (ungerstedt, 1971; miller and
beninger, 1991; schallert et al., 2000). the aims model, which
was utilized in the current study, is an alternative method to
drug-induced rotations that employs discrete behavioral
measures and displays face validity with known antidyskinetic compounds (lundblad et al., 2002; taylor et al.,
2005). despite concerns of loss of responsivity, the current
study and others have shown that aims can be maintained
over repeated testing by separating experimental days after
initial priming (bishop et al., 2006; taylor et al., 2006). in the
current study, we corroborated aims induction by l-dopa
but also d1r and  xxxg656xxx  agonists (monville et al., 2005; delfino
et al., 2007), providing us with the opportunity to investigate
the effects of 5-ht1ar stimulation on receptor-specific
behaviors. as portrayed in fig. 1, the current study used
d1r priming instead of l-dopa to sensitize both d1 and d2
receptors (pollack and yates, 1999). this was done in order to
address the mechanistic questions that surround the
specific effects of the interactions between d1, d2, and  xxxg1108xxx  receptors. l-dopa priming may have disrupted this
investigation by stimulating multiple da receptor classes. as
such, l-dopa treatment was performed during the last 3 test
days. a post-test with the d1r agonist confirmed that d1rinduced aims remained stable throughout the post-priming
testing period (data not shown).

‘d’ denotes day. aims and rotations were rated on priming days, testing days, and the post-test.

the first goal of the present study was to confirm that 5ht1ar stimulation would decrease l-dopa-mediated aims
and rotations. as shown in fig. 2, alo aims were potently
attenuated by the high dose of ±8-oh-dpat and moderately
reduced by the low dose of ±8-oh-dpat. l-dopa-induced
contralateral rotations were uniformly diminished by the high
dose of ± 8-oh-dpat. interestingly, rotations were initially
reduced by the low dose of ±8-oh-dpat but augmented after
approximately 40 min of treatment. the present results
support previous work demonstrating that 5-ht1ar stimulation can reduce lid in both experimental models of pd
(bibbiani et al., 2001; tomiyama et al., 2005; ba et al., 2006),
and clinical populations (kannari et al., 2002; bara-jimenez et
al., 2005; goetz et al., 2007). while the mechanism for these
actions is unclear, the most prominent theory postulates that
in the da-depleted brain, serotonergic raphestriatal neurons
usurp the role of the nigrostriatal pathway, converting l-dopa
into da and releasing it into the striatum (arai et al., 1996;
tanaka et al., 1999). stimulating 5-ht1a somatodendritic
autoreceptors on raphestriatal neurons decreases pulsatile
stimulation of da receptors in the striatum and prolongs da
half-life by regulating raphestriatal-derived da (tanaka et al.,
1999; olanow and obeso, 2000; kannari et al., 2001).
while this surrogate serotonergic neuroplasticity is compelling and deserves continued investigation, recent evidence
also indicates that 5-ht1ar stimulation may also directly
influence post-synaptic da receptor-mediated behaviors that
are likely raphe-independent (iravani et al., 2006; matsubara et
al., 2006). thus the paramount goal of the present study was to
characterize the effects of 5-ht1ar stimulation on d1r- and
 xxxg656xxx -mediated behaviors. in order to accomplish this goal, we
employed the d1r agonist, skf81297 (peacock et al., 1990) and
the  xxxg656xxx  agonist, quinpirole (tsuruta et al., 1981) at doses that
appear to produce equivalent aims expression. numerous
studies have implicated d1 receptors in dyskinesia expression
and development. for example, studies have shown that d1r
antagonists block lid (boyce et al., 1990; elliot et al., 1992;
grondin et al., 1999; taylor et al., 2005), while d1r agonists
induce dyskinesia (breese et al., 1987; rascol et al., 2001;
monville et al., 2005; delfino et al., 2007). in the present study,
we found that d1r-induced alo aims were robustly attenuated by the high dose of ± 8-oh-dpat and time dependently
reduced by the low dose of ± 8-oh-dpat (fig. 3). contralateral
rotations induced by d1r agonism were potently enhanced by
the high dose of ±8-oh-dpat and moderately enhanced by
the low dose of ±8-oh-dpat. this differential effect of ±8-ohdpat on d1r-mediated behavior is clearly a departure from 5ht1ar stimulation on l-dopa-mediated effects that involve
reductions in both alo aims and rotations and may reflect the
reported anti-parkinsonian effects of 5-ht1ar stimulation
(matsubara et al., 2006; mignon and wolf, 2007).

d2 receptors have also been implicated in the expression
and development of dyskinesia (nutt et al., 2000; lundblad et
al., 2002; delfino et al., 2004). for example, studies have
found lid can be blocked by  xxxg656xxx  antagonists (boyce et al.,
1990; grondin et al., 1999; taylor et al., 2005), and  xxxg656xxx

d1r agonists generates d1r and  xxxg656xxx  supersensitivity in the
da-lesioned striatum and site-directed da agonists can
induce dyskinesia like behaviors (gerfen et al., 2002; taylor
et al., 2005; carta et al., 2006). in addition, an upregulated
population of striatal 5-ht1ar may be acting as intrinsic
heteroreceptors on glutamatergic corticostriatal afferents to
modify da receptor function (frechilla et al., 2001; bezard et
al., 2006). this may be particularly relevant given the
suggested role of striatal d1r and nmdar in the genesis of
lid (chase and oh, 2000; kreipke and walker, 2004; brotchie,
2005; fiorentini et al., 2003, 2006) and may account for the
more potent effects of 5-ht1ar stimulation on d1r- versus
 xxxg656xxx -mediated behaviors. cortical mechanisms may also
account for the influence of 5-ht1ar stimulation on damediated behaviors. for example, the motor cortex is
implicated in lid (antonelli et al., 2005; mignon and wolf,
2005; delfino et al., 2007), and anti-parkinsonian and anti-

agonists have been used to induce dyskinesia in various
clinical and experimental investigations (rinne, 1989; monville
et al., 2005; delfino et al., 2007). in support of recent work
showing 5-ht1ar stimulation reducing d2/d3-induced behavior in mptp-treated monkeys (iravani et al., 2006), we found
 xxxg656xxx -induced alo aims were mildly attenuated by the high and
low dose of ± 8-oh-dpat (fig. 4). contralateral rotations
induced by  xxxg656xxx  stimulation were not affected by either dose
of ±8-oh-dpat, differing from the effects of 5-ht1ar stimulation on l-dopa and d1r-mediated effects. taken together, the
present findings support a stronger interaction between d1
and 5-ht1a receptors than one between d2 and 5-ht1a
receptors.
although the mechanism of action for the effects of 5ht1ar stimulation on d1r- and  xxxg656xxx -mediated behaviors
remains unknown, there is evidence to suggest that the
striatum is involved. chronic administration of l-dopa and

dyskinetic effects have been attributed to an extant 5-ht1ar
population in the cortex (mignon and wolf, 2002, 2007) and its
contribution in the reduction of glutamate release (antonelli
et al., 2005; mignon and wolf, 2005). these striatal and cortical
mechanisms alone or in concert may account for some of the
effects of 5-ht1ar stimulation on da-mediated aims and
rotations.
the administration of ± 8-oh-dpat alone has been
shown to induce several different types of behaviors,
including rotational behavior (mignon and wolf, 2005) and
5-ht syndrome (blanchard et al., 1993). thus, an additional
goal of the present study was to determine whether ±8-ohdpat administration alone would cause alo aims and/or
rotations in the hemiparkinsonian rat. for example, other
studies have found that 5-ht1ar stimulation induces either
ipsilateral turning (mignon and wolf, 2005) or contralateral
turning (matsubara et al., 2006) in 6-ohda-lesioned animals
depending on the dose and compound employed. in the
present study, we did not find any significant rotational or
dyskinetic behavior with the administration of ±8-oh-dpat
at the doses tested. we did, however, observe flat body
posture and lower lip retraction characteristic of 5-ht
syndrome (tricklebank et al., 1984; berendsen et al., 1989)
with the high dose of ±8-oh-dpat in a minority of the
animals in each treatment condition but these responses
were transient. since the effect did not appear detrimental
to the animals and remained for only a short period of time
(<30 min), 5-ht syndrome did not appear to significantly
influence the results of the present study.
finally, there is some disconnect between the literature of
5-ht1ar effects in rodents versus those seen in humans and
primates. most rodent models describe reduced dyskinesia
without additional motor disability (mignon and wolf, 2005;
tomiyama et al., 2005; matsubara et al., 2006); whereas some
studies involving humans or primates have indicated that 5ht1ar stimulation decreased lid but at the expense of
increased motor disability (kannari et al., 2002; iravani et al.,
2006). therefore, the use of 5-ht1ar agonists as adjuncts to ldopa therapy for humans may be limited by the potency of
the compound. while reversing lid, full agonists like ±8-ohdpat, and the more potent enantiomer +8-oh-dpat, may
reduce l-dopa efficacy by receptor specific-induction of 5-ht
syndrome. the use of 5-ht1ar agonists as adjuncts to l-dopa
may also be restricted or in some cases improved by the offreceptor effects of the compound being employed. for
example, most partial agonists also act to a lesser extent at
da receptors. therefore, there are certain limits to the model
employed in the present study.
in conclusion, clinical and experimental evidence suggests
that 5-ht1ar stimulation may have beneficial effects including anti-parkinsonian, improved l-dopa efficacy, and antidyskinetic effects. the results of the present study suggest
another possible use for this class of compounds. 5-ht1ar
stimulation may be useful as an adjunct to monotherapy by
providing a way to augment da agonist efficacy and reduce
the development of dyskinesia, thereby delaying the need for
l-dopa and prolonging the efficacious treatment of the
symptoms of pd. future research investigating the specific
site(s) of action and mechanism(s) may help to further support
this potential approach.

experimental procedure

4.1.

animals

adult male sprague–dawley rats were used (225–250 g upon
arrival; taconic farms, hudson, ny, usa). rats were kept in
plastic cages (22 cm high, 45 cm deep and 23 cm wide) and
given free access to food (rodent diet 5001; lab diet, brentwood, mo, usa) and water. the colony room was kept on a 12h light/dark cycle (light on at 0700 h) and maintained at 22–
23 °c. the guidelines of the institutional animal care and use
committee of binghamton university and the “guide for the
care and use of laboratory animals” (institute of laboratory
animal resources, national academic press 1996; nih publication number 85-23, revised 1996) were maintained
throughout the study.

4.2.

6-hydroxydopamine lesion surgeries

one week after arrival, rats received unilateral da lesions of
the left medial forebrain bundle. each rat was administered
desipramine hcl (25 mg/kg, i.p.; sigma) 30 min prior to surgery
in order to protect norepinephrine (ne) neurons. rats were
anesthetized with inhalant isoflurane (2–3%; sigma) in oxygen
(2.5 l/min) and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (david kopf
instruments, tujunga, ca, usa). the following coordinates
relative to bregma were used for the site of injection: ap,
−1.8 mm; ml, +2.0 mm; dv, − 8.6 mm, with the incisor bar
positioned at 3.3 mm below interaural line (paxinos and
watson, 1998). after drilling a small hole in the skull above
the site of injection, a 10-mul hamilton syringe attached to a
26-gauge needle was lowered into the target. at that point,
4 mul of 6-hydroxydopamine hydrobromide (6-ohda; 3 mug/mul;
sigma), dissolved in 0.9% nacl + 0.1%  xxxd228xxx , was
injected at a rate of 2 mul/min. the needle was withdrawn
1 min later. stainless steel wound clips were used to close the
surgical site. animals were placed in clean cages and allowed
to recover with ad lib food and water. wound clips were
removed 3–4 days post-surgery and rats were monitored and
handled twice per week for 3 weeks to ensure full recovery
and acclimation to experimenters.

4.3.

pharmacological treatments

a time course including surgery, drug administration and
behavioral testing is shown in fig. 1. three weeks after 6ohda lesions, rats received injections of the d1r agonist r(+)skf-81297 hydrobromide (skf81297; 0.8 mg/kg, i.p.; sigma) on
3 separate occasions 2 to 3 days apart in order to sensitize both
d1 and d2 receptors (pollack and yates, 1999). contralateral
rotations and aims (see description below) were observed
immediately after injections. rats displaying a total aims
score of ≥15 by the 3rd day of d1r priming were retained for
further study (n = 9 of 12, 75%).
the pharmacological treatment regimen commenced
2 days after the last day of skf81297 priming. using a
randomized within subjects design, 3 groups of 3 rats/group
received different treatment combinations in a given day in
order to reduce time effects. test days were separated by a

br a i n r es e a rc h 1 1 5 8 ( 2 00 7 ) 1 3 5 –1 43

period of 2 to 3 days. on the first 8 test days, rats received
1 of 3 pretreatments: vehicle (dh20) or the  xxxg1108xxx 
agonist ± 8-oh-dpat (0.1 or 1.0 mg/kg, i.p.; sigma). these
pretreatments were followed 5 min later by injections with:
vehicle (dmso), the d1r agonist skf81297 (0.8 mg/kg, i.p.),
or the  xxxg656xxx  agonist (±)-quinpirole dihydrochloride (quinpirole;
0.2 mg/kg, i.p.; sigma). one week later, rats were tested with
pretreatments of vehicle (dh20) or ± 8-oh-dpat (0.1 or
1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) 5 min prior to injection with  xxxd2471xxx  methyl ester hydrochloride (l-dopa; 12 mg/kg,
i.p.; sigma) + dl-serine 2-(2,3,4-trihydroxybenzyl)  xxxd2396xxx 
hydrochloride (benserazide; 15 mg/kg, i.p.; sigma) in a randomized order. on each of the aforementioned test days, all
rats were monitored for aims and rotations immediately
following the second injection as described below. in total
there were 12 combinations tested and all animals received
all treatments.

4.4.

behavioral procedures

rats were monitored for aims using a procedure slightly
modified from that described in lundblad et al. (2002) and
bishop et al. (2006). on test days (09.00–14.00 h), rats were
individually placed in plastic trays (60 × 75 cm) 5 min prior to
pretreatments. following skf81297, quinpirole, or l-dopa
injection, a trained observer blind to treatment condition
assessed each rat for exhibition of axial, limb, orolingual and
locomotor aims. in addition, contralateral rotations, defined
as complete 360° turns away from the lesioned side of the
brain, were tallied. no ipsilateral rotations, defined as
completed 360° turns toward the lesioned side of the brain,
were observed during testing at the doses used. dystonic
posturing of the neck and torso, involving positioning of the
neck and torso in a twisted manner directed toward the side
of the body contralateral to the lesion, were referred to as
‘axial’ aims. ‘limb’ aims were defined as rapid, purposeless
movements of the forelimb located on the side of the body
contralateral to the lesion. ‘orolingual’ aims were composed
of repetitive openings and closings of the jaw and tongue
protrusions. the movements were considered abnormal as
they occurred at times when the rats were not chewing or
gnawing on food or other objects. rats occasionally performed ‘locomotor’ aims, in which they ambulated in a
contralateral circular direction. every 10th min for 2 h, rats
were observed for 2 consecutive min. rats were rated for
aims during the 1st min and rotational behavior in the 2nd
min. during the aims observation periods (beginning 10, 20,
30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110 and 120 min postinjection), a
severity score of 0–4 was assigned for each aims category: 0,
not present; 1, present for <50% of the observation period (i.e.,
1–29 s); 2, present for n50% or more of the observation period
(i.e., 30–59 s); 3, present for the entire observation period (i.e.
60 s); and interrupted by a loud stimulus (a tap on the wire
cage lid), or 4, present for the entire observation period but
not interrupted by a loud stimulus. thus, the theoretical
maximum score for each type of aim was 48 (4 × 12 periods)
although observed scores were never this severe. for three of
the aims subcategories (axial, forelimb, and orolingual; alo
aims), the scores were summed for the entire 2-h period. alo
aims (with a maximum potential of 144) and rotations were

141

tallied for the entire 2-h period. locomotor aims were also
rated but not included in the analyses given the explicit
collection of rotational data.

4.5.

high performance liquid chromatography

rats were sacrificed by decapitation on the final day of the
study and the striatum was dissected out, immediately frozen
on dry ice and stored at − 80 °c. reverse-phase high
performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrochemical detection (hplc-ec) was performed on striatal tissue,
obtained from all rats, according to protocol of kilpatrick et al.
(1986), a method for semiautomated catecholamine and
indoleamine analysis with coulometric detection. the system
included an esa autoinjector (model 542), an esa solvent
delivery system (1582), an external pulse dampener (esa), an
esa column and a c-18 (100 × 4.6 mm, 5 mum packing) column
(esa). samples were homogenized in ice-cold perchloric acid
(0.1 m) with 1% ethanol and 0.02% edta. the homogenates
were spun for 30 min at 16,100×g with the temperature
maintained at 4 °c. aliquots of supernatant were then
analyzed for abundance of da, 5-ht, ne, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (dopac) and 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid
(5-hiaa). samples were separated using a mobile phase
composed of sodium phosphate (monobasic, anhydrous),
100 mm; edta, 0.05 mm; octane sulphonic acid, 1.4 mm;
and acetonitrile, 9% adjusted to ph 3.0 with o-phosphoric
acid. a coulometric detector configured with three electrodes
(coulochem iii; esa) measured the content of monoamines
and metabolites. an esa model 5020 guard cell (+300 mv)
was positioned prior to the autoinjector. the analytical cell
(esa model 501la; first electrode at − 100 mv, second
electrode at + 250 mv) was located immediately after the
column. the second analytical electrode emitted signals that
were recorded and analyzed by ezchrom elite software via
scientific software inc. module (ss420x). the final oxidation
current values were adjusted to striatal tissue weights and
expressed as nanograms (ng) of monoamine or metabolite
per milligram (mg) tissue (mean ± sem).

4.6.

data analyses

monoamine and metabolite levels in the striatum were
analyzed using paired t-tests (comparing intact versus
lesioned striata). treatment effects (expressed as means ±
sem) for alo aims and rotations were analyzed by employing
non-parametric kruskal–wallis tests and two-way anovas,
respectively. significant differences between treatments were
determined by mann–whitney post hoc comparisons for alo
aims, and fisher’s lsd post hoc tests for rotations. analyses
were performed with the use of statistica software ’98 (statsoft
inc., tulsa, ok, usa). alpha was set at p < 0.05.
