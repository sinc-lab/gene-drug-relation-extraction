abstract

the opiate agonists,  xxxd2421xxx , methadone and pethidine, were evaluated as n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor antagonists
using the rat cortical wedge preparation and the neonatal rat spinal cord preparation for electrophysiological studies and [3h](rs)-5methyl-10,11-dihydro-5h-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine ([3h]mk-801) binding experiments using rat forebrain homogenates.
 xxxd2421xxx , methadone and pethidine were inhibitors of [3h]mk-801 binding with ki values of 26/~m, 0.85/tm and 47/tm,
respectively. in the cortex, 1 mm  xxxd2421xxx  and 1 mm methadone reduced nmda responses, but not (rs)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy5-methylisoxazol-4-yl) xxxd3029xxx  (ampa) or kainate responses in an use-dependent manner, whereas 1 mm pethidine was devoid
of antagonist activity. in the spinal cord preparation, the activities of  xxxd2421xxx  and methadone were weaker than in cortex. in
contrast, pethidine was equipotent with  xxxd2421xxx  in the spinal cord. these results suggest that  xxxd2421xxx  and methadone may
be useful therapeutic agents in conditions where a combined opiate agonist and nmda antagonist treatment is desired.

excitatory amino acid (eaa) receptors are thought to
be implicated in several physiological and pathophysiological processes [3,11,14,15,17,18,21]. the involvement of eaa receptors in the neurodegeneration following ischemic episodes is well established [16]. it has been
suggested that eaa receptors in general, and the nmethyl-d-aspartate (nmda) subtype in particular, are
involved in the phenomenon termed wind-up [8,20]. experiments using the competitive nmda antagonist (rs)2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid ( xxxd1353xxx ) or the noncompetitive nmda antagonist (rs)-5-methyl- 10,11-dihydro-5h-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine (mk-801)
have suggested that blockade of nmda receptors can
completely abolish wind-up [7,24,26]. activation of opiate receptors delays the onset of wind-up, but cannot
block it, whereas a combination of nmda antagonist and
opiate agonist seems to provide an effective treatment for
wind-up [4].

 xxxd2421xxx  is a potent opiate agonist, which has a
twentyfold and hundredfold higher affinity for the/t receptor than for the ~ and the x receptors, respectively [6].
our observation that the opiate analgesic  xxxd2421xxx  in
an animal model of wind-up blocked the wind-up phenomenon in a naloxone-insensitive manner prompted us
to investigate a possible nmda component in the pharmacological profile of  xxxd2421xxx . our interest in
these aspects was further stimulated by the observation of
an effect of  xxxd2421xxx  in a [3h]mk-801 binding assay [ 1]. in the present study we have further characterized
the opiate analgesics pethidine and methadone, compounds that both act preferentially at/z receptors [13] in
[3h]mk-801 binding and in electrophysiological test
systems using the rat cortical wedge [12,22] and the neonatal rat spinal cord preparations [2,25].
[3h]mk-801 binding was used as an assay for determining non-competitive nmda antagonist binding affinities. dissection of rat brain regions was performed as
described by glowinski and iversen [10]. tissue preparation was performed as described by ransom and stec
[19]. in short: tissue was homogenized (500 rev./min) in

10 vols. (w/v) ice-cold 0.32 m sucrose by eight strokes of
a glass-teflon homogenizer. the homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 min, and the supernatant was
then centrifuged at 20 000 x g for 20 min at 4°c to yield
a p2-pellet. this pellet was then re-suspended in 20 vols.
of ice-cold distilled water and homogenized (100 rev./
rain) with a glass-teflon homogenizer. the homogenate
was centrifuged at 8000 x g for 20 min at 4°c. the supernatant and buffy coat was decanted and re-centrifuged
at 48 000 x g for 20 min at 4°c. the pellet was resuspended in 20 vols. of ice-cold distilled water and centrifuged at 48 000 x g for 20 min at 4°c. the last step was
repeated once and the pellet was frozen at -20°c for at
least 18 h.
on the day of the assay, the membrane pellet was
thawed at room temperature for 45 min, suspended in
75 vols. of 5 mm tris-hc1 buffer (ph 7.4 at 25°c) using
a sonicator (2 x 10s) and centrifuged for 20min
(48 000 x g) at 4°c. this step was repeated four times.
the resulting membrane suspension is referred to as
'well-washed membranes'. the binding assay was performed following a procedure slightly different from that
of ransom and stec [19]. well-washed membranes were
re-suspended in 5 mm tris-hcl buffer (ph 7.4) with a
tissue/buffer ratio of 100 corresponding to approximately
200-300/zg protein/vial. binding experiments were carried out at 25°c and under maximum stimulation, i.e. a
final concentration of 30/zm (s)-glutamate and 1/zm
glycine. [3h]mk-801 was used at a concentration of approximately 5 nm. non-specifically bound [3h]mk-801
was determined using 100/tm n-(l-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl)piperidine (tcp). following incubation for 4 h,
binding was determined by filtration through whatman
gf/b filters (presoaked for at least 2 h in 0.1% polyethylenimine solution) using a brandell m-48r cell harvester
and 3 times 2 ml ice-cold buffer as washing medium.
the rat cortical wedge preparation is a preparation for
the evaluation of ligands interacting with eaa receptors.
wedges (500/~m thick) of rat brain containing cerebral
cortex and corpus callosum were placed with the corpus
callosum part between two layers of nappy liner and constantly superfused with a mg 2+- and ca2÷-free oxygenated
krebs buffer solution at room temperature. the cortex
part was likewise placed between layers of absorbent fiber and superfused with a mg2÷-free oxygenated krebs
buffer solution. the two parts were electrically insulated
with a grease gap. ag/agci electrodes were placed in
contact with the nappy liner on each side of the grease
gap and the potential difference between the electrodes
recorded on a chart recorder. standard and test compounds were dissolved in mg2÷-free oxygenated krebs
buffer solution and applied to the cortex part of the
wedges. agonists were applied for 90 s for determination
of depolarizing effect. an interval of 12-15 min between
two applications was used. for measurement of antagonist effects, a pretreatment for 90 s was found to be suffi-

cient for obtaining equilibrium before co-administration
with agonist for another 90 s. this procedure is a modified version of that described in refs. [12,22].
following published procedures [2,25], 2-7-day-old
sprague-dawley or wistar rats were decapitated and the
spinal cords exposed from the ventral side by removal of
overlying internal organs and vertebral bodies. by gentle
lifting at the rostral end, while the ventral and dorsal roots
were cut, the cords were freed and placed in krebs solution (of composition:  xxxg2020xxx  118 mm, nahco 3 25 mm,
glucose 11.1 mm, kci 4.7 mm, kh2po4 1.2 mm, and
caci 2 1.25 mm, equilibrated with 95% 02/5% co2 to
give ph 7.4 at room temperature) in a petri dish. any
remaining roots were trimmed off and a midline hemisection made. the hemicord was placed with the caudal part
between two layers of nappy liner and constantly superfused with a mg 2÷- and ca2+-free oxygenated krebs
buffer solution at room temperature. the rostal part was
likewise placed between layers of absorbent fiber and
superfused with a magnesium-free oxygenated krebs
buffer solution. the two parts were electrically insulated
with a grease gap. ag/ xxxg33xxx   xxxg2118xxx  electrodes were placed in
contact with the nappy liner on each side of the grease
gap and the potential difference between the electrodes
recorded on a chart recorder. standard and test compounds were dissolved in mg2+-free oxygenated krebs
buffer solution and applied to the caudal part of the
wedges.
agonists were applied for 90 s for determination of
depolarizing effects. an interval of 12-15 min between
two applications was used. for measurement of antagonist effects, a pretreatment for 90 s was found to be sufficient for obtaining equilibrium before co-administration
with agonist for another 90 s.
 xxxd2421xxx  and pethidine were relatively weak inhibitors of [3h]mk-801 binding, whereas methadone was
a potent inhibitor of [3h]mk-801 binding, nearly equipotent with dextromethorphan [9]. mk-801 and tcp were
four orders of magnitude more potent than pethidine and
 xxxd2421xxx .
in the rat cortical wedge preparation 1 mm pethidine
was inactive as an nmda antagonist (fig. 1) and as an
antagonist at (rs)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl) xxxd3029xxx  (ampa) or kainate receptors
(data not shown).  xxxd2421xxx  and methadone (1 mm)
were shown to be nmda antagonists with no significant
effects on responses produced by ampa or kainate. following co-applications of 10/zm nmda and  xxxd2421xxx  or methadone, the response to nmda was blocked
with increasing efficacy (fig. 1). thus, after four coapplications the response to 10/zm nmda was reduced
to 49 -+ 12% ( xxxd2421xxx ) or to 4 _+3% (methadone) of
the response prior to the co-applications. the antagonistic
effects of  xxxd2421xxx  and methadone were dependent
on the number of co-applications. the inhibitory effects

polarizations remained unaltered for up to six applications
(maximum number tested) and seemed to be practically
irreversible over a period of up to 4 h (data not shown).
in the spinal cord preparation, all three compounds
were inhibitors of nmda responses (fig. 1). the potencies of  xxxd2421xxx  and methadone as inhibitors were
lower in the spinal cord than in the cortex. following four
co-applications of  xxxd2421xxx  or methadone and
10/tm nmda, the responses to nmda were reduced to
63 ± 4% ( xxxd2421xxx ) and 23 +_4% (methadone). in
contrast, the potency of pethidene was increased in the
spinal cord when compared to that observed in the cortex.
thus, 1 mm pethidine reduced the response to 10pm
nmda to 51 _+5% of the response prior to the exposure
to pethidine (fig. 1). the inhibitory action of all three test
compounds is fully reversible; 45-70 min after the last
exposure, the response to nmda is of the same size as
prior to exposure to the test compounds.
the high correlation between data obtained in [3h]mk-801 binding and using the rat cortical wedge preparation strongly suggests that the inhibitory actions of  xxxd2421xxx  and methadone on nmda responses in the
rat cortical wedge preparation are due to an interaction

167

with the [3h]mk-801 binding site. thus,  xxxd2421xxx 
and methadone are most likely to act as non-competitive
nmda antagonists.  xxxd2421xxx  was a weak inhibitor
of [3h]mk-801 binding and was able to reduce nmda
responses, whereas pethidine, which was slightly weaker
than  xxxd2421xxx  in the [3h]mk-801 binding assay,
was devoid of antagonist effect in the rat cortical wedge
preparation. this dramatic difference in potency can not
be explained on the basis of the present experiments but
may reflect a partial agonist rather than an antagonist effect at brain mk-801 sites.
methadone was a potent inhibitor of [3h]mk-801
binding, approximately equipotent with dextromethorphan (table 1). methadone (1 mm) completely blocked
nmda responses in an apparently irreversible manner,
and methadone had no effects on ampa or kainate receptors. it is well known that ligands interacting with the
[3h]mk-801 binding site bind nearly irreversibly [12].
this is due to a very slow off rate. apparently both  xxxd2421xxx  and methadone have very slow off rates from
the [3h]mk-801 binding site.
methadone and  xxxd2421xxx  were weaker in the
neonatal rat spinal cord preparation than in the rat cortical
wedge preparation, whereas pethidine was more potent in
the spinal cord than in the cortex. these results may reflect difference in nmda receptor subunit compositions
in the cortex and the spinal cord. in addition to an altered
pharmacological profile, the duration of action was significantly shorter in the spinal cord when compared to the
cortex. thus, in the spinal cord, the effects of the three
test compounds were fully reversible within 45-70 min
after the last application of the test compound.
in conclusion,  xxxd2421xxx  and methadone seem to
act as non-competitive nmda antagonists in the rat cortex and rat spinal cord, whereas pethidine shows noncompetitive nmda antagonism only in the spinal cord.

opiate agonists in the clinic may shed light on the importance of different levels of nmda antagonism for the
analgesic profile of such compounds in different pain
conditions.
