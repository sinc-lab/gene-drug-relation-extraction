summary. experiments have been performed to determine whether the antisecretory (antidiarrhoeal) actions
of difenoxin and loperamide are mediated by enteric neurones. an iso-osmotic perfusion solution was circulated
around the lumen of the jejunum of anaesthetised rats.
 xxxg2417xxx  was infused intra-arterially
to induce net fluid secretion which was inhibited by
difenoxin (eds0, 0.23 mg/kg) and loperamide (eds0,
0.5 mg/kg). however, neither were able to restore the fluid transport rate to the control level of absorption.
the antisecretory effects of difenoxin (0.77 mg/kg)
and loperamide (0.6 mg/kg) were blocked by the opiate
receptor antagonist naloxone (2mg/kg). their effects
were also abolished by pretreatment with the 5-ht synthesis inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine (pcpa; 200 mg/
kg; with desmethylimipramine given beforehand to protect noradrenergic nerves and enhance 5-ht depletion).
the effect of difenoxin was blocked with methiothepin
(1 mg/kg) and  xxxd2621xxx  (30 ~tg/kg) but not
 xxxd2419xxx  (30 ixg/kg), ritanserin (30mg/kg), ondansetron (10 ~tg/kg) or ics 205-930 (3 mg/kg). none of the
above 5-ht receptor antagonists modified the antisecretory effect of loperamide. the antisecretory effect of
difenoxin but not loperamide was prevented by  xxxd2914xxx  (2 mg/kg) and by pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine (150 mg/kg total).
it is concluded that both difenoxin and loperamide inhibit net fluid secretion by indirect mechanisms. it is proposed that the initial action is on enteric ~t-opiate receptors and that this results in the release of 5-ht. in the
case of difenoxin, the 5-ht may act on 5-htl-like receptors to release noradrenaline. however, the major difference in the mechanism of action of loperamide compared
to difenoxin is that it does not utilize noradrenaline as the
final mediator of its antisecretory action.

introduction
difenoxin is the active metabolite of the antidiarrhoeal
drug  xxxd1908xxx  (heykants and janssen 1972; karim
et al. 1971). the discovery and development of  xxxd1908xxx  resulted from a large screening programme wich
identified novel 'intestine selective' pethidine-like compounds with low narcotic analgesic activity (janssen and
jageneau 1957; janssen et al. 1959). however, greater dissociation between the central and intestinal effects was
desirable and this was achieved by modifying the  xxxd1908xxx  molecule to produce ultimately loperamide
(stokbroeckx et al. 1973). early studies with  xxxd1908xxx  and loperamide established that they acted like the
opiates morphine and codeine to inhibit gastrointestinal
propulsive motility patterns as can occur in diarrhoea
(awouters et al. 1983; heel et al. 1978). however, the underlying cause of most diarrhoeal states is a pathophysiological disturbance of the mucosa resulting in fluid secretion into the lumen of the intestine. secretion is stimulated by a diverse range of substances such as neurotransmitters ( xxxg2417xxx , vip; acetylcholine), local hormones ( xxxd1903xxx  a, pgee) and detergents (bile acids). a large number of exogenous substances, such as bacterial enterotoxins, also stimulate
intestinal secretion and hence cause diarrhoea (binder
1990; brown and miller 1991; fondacaro 1986). it is now
well established that the antidiarrhoeal drugs produce
their clinical effect mainly by exerting a local antisecretory action on the intestinal mucosa (awouters et al. 1983;
coupar 1987). for instance,  xxxd1908xxx  (karim 1974)
and loperamide (karim and adaiken 1977; press et al.
1991) both inhibit  xxxd1903xxx  a (pge2)-induced secretion in human subjects.
however, it is not known how the antidiarrhoeal
drugs mediate their antisecretory effect through intestinal
nerves. to address this coupar and taylor (1987) used
neurotoxins and receptor antagonists to provided evidence that morphine acts indirectly to inhibit vip-induced secretion in the rat jejunum by utilising 5-ht and
noradrenaline as intermediates. thus morphine initiates

materials and methods
the method o f measuring fluid transport by the rat jejunum has been
described previously in detail by coupar (1985) and is summarised below.

surgical procedure and analytical procedures. hooded wistar rats of
either sex (230-290g weight) were anaesthetized with pentobarbitone
sodium (60 mg/kg) subcutaneously (s.c.) in studies with difenoxin and
intraperitoneally (i.p.) in those with loperamide. a cannula was introduced into the left jugular vein for administration of antagonist drugs
and into the left common carotid artery for constant intra-arterial (i.a.)
infusion of vip (0.8 lig/min) in saline, or saline as control, at a rate of
40 ~tl/min. mean systemic blood pressure was recorded to monitor the
condition of the rats from a side-arm off the carotid cannula by means
of a statham pressure transducer connected to a neomedix neotrace recorder.
a recirculation technique was used to measure the net fluid transport rate of the jejunum. a 25 to 30 cm length of intestine, starting distal from the ligament of trietz, was continuously perfused with 8 ml
of an iso-0smotic solution containing nacl 148, kc1 5 and dextrose
5.5 ram. phenol red, 0.05 ram, was also present in the solution to act
as a non-absorbable water marker. the solution was contained in a reservoir maintained at 37 °c and recirculated through the lumen of the jejunum, by a gas-lift column of moistened 5% co 2 in 02.
the fluid from the loop was recovered at the end of the 20 min perfusion period. samples were diluted with buffer and peak absorbances
were measured at 560 nm as well as 520 and 600 nm to correct for nonspecific interferences as described by miller and schedl (1972). results
are expressed as the net amount of water absorbed (+) or secreted ( - )
in gl per gram wet weight of jejunum during the 20 min perfusion.

experimental procedure for administration of drugs
- pretreatments. three pretreatment regimens were used in the following experiments. the first procedure was administration with
6-hydroxydopamine (6-ohda) to produce chemical sympathectomy
(thoenen and tranzer 1973). an initial dose of 6-ohda (50 mg/kg)
was administered i.p. (day one), followed by 100 mg/kg in two doses on
the third day. rats were used 4 days after the initial injection.
a second group was administered with p-chlorophenylalanine
(pcpa) to deplete 5-ht (koe and weissman 1966). pcpa was given as
a single 200 mg/kg i.p. dose two days before experiments. these two
methods have been used previously by coupar and taylor (1987) where
it was found that 6-ohda caused a 93% depletion of noradrenaline
from the rat small intestine without affecting the level of 5-ht. however, pcpa was not selective and caused only a 69.5% reduction in 5-ht
with a 12% reduction in the noradrenaline content of the small intestine. therefore, a third group was pretreated with desmethylimipramine
(dmi), 45 rain before giving pcpa, to protect noradrenergic nerves and
to enhance 5-ht depletion (breese et al. 1978; sawynok and reid 1990;
bjorklund et al. 1975).
- acute treatments. animals were anaesthetised with pentobarbitone
sodium (60 mg/kg, 0.1 ml/100 g). the antidiarrhoeal drugs were dissolved in, and co-administered with the anaesthetic solution since they
were both readily soluble in the solution. difenoxin was injected s.c. but
loperamide was injected i.p. this was because a dose-related effect of
loperamide was not observed when it was given s.c.
each antidiarrhoeal drug was immediately followed by an i.p. injection of an a-adrenoceptor or 5-ht receptor blocking drug, or saline in
control experiments. following the onset of anaesthesia, and after a total of 55 rain, the same dose of antagonist was given again intravenously
in 0.2 ml of saline per 100 g. doses quoted in the text are the dose levels
of single injections. five min later, i.a. infusion of vip in saline, or saline as control, commenced and continued for the duration of the
luminal perfusion period (20 min); perfusion of the lumen commenced
5 min after the start of vip infusion.
statistical analysis was carried out using analysis of variance. student's
unpaired t-test was used to compare single treatments with their appropriate control. differences between several treatment means to their single common control were assessed using dunnett's t-test. the criterion
for statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. the results are expressed
as mean_+ sem.

the effect of drugs on the response to difenoxin
and loperamide
in all further experiments, rats were treated with a submaximal antisecretory dose of either difenoxin (0.77 mg/
kg) or loperamide (0.6 mg/kg). vip-induced secretion
was inhibited from (-)244+28 ~l/g (n = 17) in 20 min to
(+)47+63 ~tl/g (n =7) and ( - ) 3 5 + 5 4 b l / g (n = 5) by
these doses of difenoxin and loperamide respectively, as
shown in figs. 2 - 4 . these doses had no effect on fluid
absorption in control experiments (i.a. infusion of saline)
thus, their effects are appropriately termed antisecretory
rather than proabsorptive.

as shown in fig. 2 the antisecretory effects of both
difenoxin (0.77 mg/kg) and loperamide (0.6 mg/kg) were
blocked by 2 mg/kg of the opiate receptor antagonist
naloxone. a previous study (lee and coupar 1980)
showed that this dose of naloxone does not alter either
the basal rate of absorption or secretion induced by vie
the antisecretory effect of difenoxin was abolished by
the 5-ht synthesis inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine
(pcpa; 200 mg/kg) but only when it was given after
desipramine (20 mg/kg; fig. 2). it was also blocked by
the mixed 5-hti-like/5-ht2 antagonists methiothepin
(1 mg/kg; see saxena et al. 1986) and  xxxd2621xxx 
(30 ~g/kg; see saxena et al. 1986; coupar and taylor
1987) as shown in fig. 3. however, the effect of difenoxin
was not altered by the 5-ht 2 receptor antagonists
 xxxd2419xxx  (30 ~tg/kg; see coupar and taylor 1987) and

however, even at the highest dose tested (3.1 mg/kg), fluid transport was not restored to the basal rate of absorption (fig. 1). the antisecretory eds0 for difenoxin was
0.23 mg/kg (95°70 c.l. 0.11-0.36; n = 17).
similarly, loperamide (0.16-1.5mg/kg) caused a
dose-related inhibition of vip-induced secretion (fig. 1).
as with difenoxin, fluid transport was not restored to the
basal level of absorption (fig. 1). the antisecretory eds0
value for loperamide was 0.5mg/kg (95070 c.l.
0.36-0.53; n = 15).

ritanserin (30mg/kg; awouters et al. 1988), the 5-ht 3
receptor antagonist ondansetron (10 ~g/kg; butler et al.
1988; costall and naylor 1990) and ics 205-930 (5-ht 3
receptor antagonist) which blocks 5-ht 4 receptors when
used in large amounts as in this study (3 mg/kg; buchheit
et al. 1985; costall and naylor 1990). the values of the
net rate of fluid transport were as follows:  xxxd2419xxx 
- 4 6 + 6 3 ( n = l l ) , ritanserin -37_+37 ( n = 8 ) , ondansetron - 57+ 44 and ics 205-930 - 57-+26 (n = 6)
~tl/g in 20 rain.
the action of loperamide differed to difenoxin in that
methiothepin did not block its antisecretory effect (fig. 3;
 xxxd2621xxx  was not tested). the other 5-ht receptor
antagonists which did not affect the response to difenoxin were also ineffective against loperamide. the values of
the net rate of fluid transport were as follows:  xxxd2419xxx 
- 1 4 6 + 3 6 (n = 5), ondansetron -132+_47 (n = 5) and
ics 205-930 - 35-+ 36 (n = 6) ~tl/g in 20 min. another
similarity between the two drugs was that the effect of
loperamide was prevented by the pretreatment with
pcpa after desipramine (fig. 2).
it has been established previously that the doses of
 xxxd2621xxx ,  xxxd2419xxx  and pcpa do not affect the
rates of fluid absorption or secretion (coupar and taylor
1987). in this study, neither of the other 5-ht receptor
antagonists nor desipramine plus pcpa pretreatment,
had an effect of fluid absorption or vip-induced fluid secretion in control experiments.

effects of a-adrenoceptor antagonists
and chemical sympathectomy
a previous study (coupar and taylor 1987) showed that
the dose of  xxxd2914xxx  and pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-ohda), as used in this study, do not
alter either the basal rate of absorption or secretion induced by vie however, this study shows that idazoxan
significantly reduced vip-induced fluid secretion to
(-)143_+33~1/g in 20min (n=10; student's t-test,
p < o.o5).
as shown in fig. 4 the antisecretory effect of difenoxin (0.77 mg/kg) was blocked by  xxxd2914xxx  (2 mg/kg)
and by pretreatment of rats with 6-ohda. however, the
antisecretory effect of loperamide (0.6 mg/kg) was unaltered by either  xxxd2914xxx  (2 mg/kg) or pretreatment
with 6-ohda (fig. 4).

discussion

the findings indicate that the antisecretory action of difenoxin is relayed indirectly to the intestinal mucosa
through opiate, serotonergic and noradrenergic systems.
loperamide had a similar potency and efficacy as
difenoxin, but some notable differences were found in its
mechanism of action. overall, the findings extend initial
observations in our laboratory that 5-ht and noradrenaline are essential intermediates in the antisecretory action
of morphine (coupar and taylor 1987) to these clinically
relevant antidiarrhoeal drugs.
the antisecretory potencies of difenoxin and loperamide were found to be similar with eds0 values of 0.23
and 0.5 mg/kg respectively, even though they were administered by different routes (difenoxin s.c., loperamide i.p.).
these eds0 values were measured 1 hr after administration and were in close agreement with corresponding
eds0 s for protection against castor oil-induced diarrhoea (difenoxine 0.19mg/kg, loperamide 0.29mg/kg;
megens et al. 1990). this close correlation between the
antisecretory and antidiarrhoeal effect of these drugs validates the present model as useful for studying pathological diarrhoea.
the efficacies of difenoxin and loperamide at inhibiting vip-induced secretion were also similar, such that
they blocked secretion but were incapable of restoring net
fluid transport to its normal rate of absorption. the observation that opiates reverse vip-induced secretion but
do not restore fluid transport to absorption has also been
noted previously (coupar 1983). this contrasts to the effect of opiate antidiarrhoeals against pge2-induced secretion where a full restoration to fluid absorption is established (beubler and badhri 1990; margaritis et al.
1991). the observation suggests that there is a component of the net fluid secreting mechanism of vip which
is resistant to these opiate antidiarrhoeal drugs.
some similarities were also noted in the mechanisms
of action of both difenoxin and loperamide. for instance,
the antisecretory action of both drugs, as for morphine
(coupar 1983), was abolished by naloxone. this result
confirms that of previous studies which have shown that
difenoxin and loperamide are both opiate agonists (stahl
et al. 1977; wuster and herz 1978). it has been established that the u-opiate receptor subtype mediates the inhibition of vip-induced secretion in the rat jejunum
(coupar 1983) and radioligand binding experiments indi-

235
cate that the receptors are located in the submucosa and
myenteric plexus (dashwood et al. 1985; monferini et al.
1981; nishimura et al. 1986). therefore, the present finding that naloxone blocks the antisecretory action of both
difenoxin and loperamide further emphasises that ix-opiate receptors have a dominant role in preventing excessive
fluid loss from the intestine.
loperamide has been shown to have non-opiate actions in addition to stimulation of opiate receptors, and
these have also been offered as explanations for its antidiarrhoeal effect. for example, loperamide inhibits
ca 2÷ entry into enterocytes and inhibits calmodulin (see
below), which is essential to the intestinal secretory process. however, these non-opiate effects are not evident, at
least in the rat. the basis of this assumption is that the
antisecretory effect of loperamide is blocked by naloxone
(this study and sandhu et al. 1981) as is the functional
antidiarrhoeal action as assessed by the caster oil test
(piercey and ruwart 1979).
another feature which is common to the antisecretory
mechanism of difenoxin and loperamide is that both
utilise 5-ht as a mediator. the 5-ht of the intestine is
located mainly in ec cells of the mucosa (ahlman et al.
1973) but it also occurs in tryptaminergic cell bodies in
the myenteric plexus. these send single fine processes
ending in varicosities to ganglia of the myenteric and submucous plexuses (costa et al. 1982; furness and costa
1982). depletion of 5-ht using the 5-ht synthesis inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine (pcpa) abolished the antisecretory effect of difenoxin, but only when dmi was
given beforehand. dmi is reported to enhance the selectivity of 5-ht depleting agents (see methods) and this is
confirmed in our study on the basis of this finding with
difenoxin. the pretreatment also blocked the antisecretory effect of loperamide (pcpa alone was not tried). this
involvement of 5-ht in the mechanism of action of the
antidiarrhoeals is shared also by morphine which also inhibits vip-induced secretion (coupar and taylor 1987)
and motility (burks 1976) by activating tryptaminergic
mechanisms. it is postulated that the 5-ht released by
the antidiarrhoeal drugs is localised to cells (neurones/epithelium) involved only with antimotility and antisecretory effects. this appears to be the case since exogenously
administered 5-ht results in intestinal secretion (beubler
et al. 1989; hardcastle et al. 1981).
unfortunately, the 5-ht receptor subtype involved in
mediating the antisecretory effects of difenoxin and
loperamide have not been revealed clearly by the results
of this study. '5-htl-like' receptors appear to be involved in the response to difenoxin since its effect was
blocked by  xxxd2621xxx  and methiothepin but not by
 xxxd2419xxx . this was an unexpected result since a previous
study (using the same method), had shown that the antisecretory effect of morphine, was blocked by  xxxd2419xxx 
(coupar and taylor 1987). the result with loperamide
was also unexpected since its antisecretory effect was resistant not only to 5-hti and 5-ht2-, but also antagonists of other 5-ht-receptor subtypes (5-ht 3 and
 xxxg1117xxx ).
this study has revealed a major difference between
the mechanisms of action of difenoxin and loperamide

regarding the involvement of noradrenergic neurones,
which were shown to mediate the antisecretory effect of
morphine in a previous study (coupar and taylor 1987).
the difference between the mechanisms of action was apparent by the different susceptibilities of the antidiarrhoeal drugs to chemical sympathectomy using 6-hydroxydopamine (6-ohda) and adrenoceptor blockade with
 xxxd2914xxx . the effect of difenoxin was shown to be
sensitive to both of these treatments, indicating that its
mechanism of action is similar to that of morphine
(coupar and taylor 1987). the noradrenergic nerves activated by difenoxin are probably those that have been
identified running close to the crypts and villus epithelium in the rat jejunum (thomas and templeton 1982;
schultsberg et al. 1980). the idea that noradrenergic
nerves mediate antisecretory effects is not new. for instance, it has been shown that stimulation of sympathetic
nerves in the rat small intestine leads to an antisecretory
effect (sjovall 1984). the effect of noradrenaline from
such nerves may be through az-adrenoceptors since
agonists at this receptor type have a remarkably similar
spectrum of antisecretory effect to morphine (nakaki et
al. 1982) and a2-adrenoceptor binding sites are located
on the basolateral membranes of intestinal epithelial cells
(cotterell et al. 1982; nakaki et al. 1983). indeed, the
data suggests that noradrenaline is a mediator and the final common inhibitor of fluid secretion for difenoxin and
morphine.
unfortunately, a definite functional role for a2-adrenoceptors in the mechanism of action of difenoxin could
not be established in the present study. this is because the
az-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan, by itself, reduced
vip-induced secretion indicating it suppresses secretion
directly in addition to blocking adrenoceptors. it is possible that this unexpected effect is mediated through recently identified 'non-adrenoceptor idazoxan binding
sites' (sites labelled by [3h]-idazoxan but not [~h]-yohimbine; see portillo et al. 1991). presently however, the
role of these entities remains speculative. .
the interpretation of why the antisecretory effect of
loperamide is not abolished by chemical sympathectomy
or the adrenoceptor antagonist  xxxd2914xxx  also remains speculative. as mentioned above numerous nonopiate actions are attributed to loperamide. these include
verapamil-like calcium channel blocking activity (chang
et al. 1986; reynolds et al. 1984), inhibition of calcium/calmodulin (see press et al. 1991) and inhibition of
sodium-dependent solute transport systems (hardcastle
et al. 1986). however, the antisecretory effect of loperamide was totally abolished by the opiate receptor antagonist naloxone. therefore, the present results indicate
that loperamide mediates its antisecretory effect through
a different post (opiate) receptor pathway to morphine
and difenoxin. future studies could test the possibilities
that loperamide releases another antisecretory neurotransmitter such as somatostatin (see brown and miller
1991).
the differences in susceptibilities of difenoxin and
loperamide to adrenoceptor and 5-ht antagonists could
possibly be attributed to the fact that they have different
pharmacokinetic properties (heykants et al. 1974). in

236

this respect both accumulate in the intestinal wall at high
concentrations (heykants et al. 1972, 1974) and this may
have interfered with the action of the receptor antagonists. however, this does not explain why loperamide was
resistant to 6-ohda because this drug was administered
as a pretreatment before loperamide and at a dose which
is known to result in chemical sympathectomy of the rat
intestine (coupar and taylor 1987).
similarly, the differences between difenoxin and
loperamide cannot be easily attributed to differences in
the route of administration. in this study loperamide was
administered i.p. with the anaesthetic, whereas difenoxin
was given s.c. however, the antidiarrhoeal drugs were given at least one hour before experimental procedures were
begun and this resulted in similar effects and potency values to those quoted in the literature for inhibition of castor oil induced diarrhoea following oral administration
(bianchi and goi 1977; niemegeers et al. 1974).
it is proposed that difenoxin activates enteric g-opiate-sensitive neurones to release 5-ht followed by noradrenaline; the subsequent stimulation of ae-adrenoceptors located on the enterocytes leads to inhibition of secretion. the observation that the antisecretory effect of
loperamide is mediated through opiate-sensitive neurones, but does not utilize noradrenaline as the final mediator is difficult to reconcile, but it may be related to its
unusual physico-chemical properties. loperamide and
difenoxin are both structurally related (to pethidine), but
loperamide differs as it is extremely lipid soluble and has
significant surfactant activity (wuster et al. 1978). the
drug also becomes selectively concentrated in the intestine, partly due to enterohepatic shunting and partly to
high specific and non-specific binding (awouters et al.
1983; miyazaki et al. 1982; wuster et al. 1978), where it
may exert both opiate and non-opiate effects. consequently, the present findings further emphasise the
unique pharmacological properties of loperamide. in
conclusion, the pharmacological mechanism by which
difenoxin exerts its antisecretory effect parallels that of
morphine more closely than does that of loperamide.
