abstract
this study was conducted to examine stress-induced effects on gene expression of specific
markers for hpa axis and neuronal activity in fetuses and neonatal pigs. brain, pituitary gland, and
adrenal gland were obtained to determine the mrna levels for  xxxg517xxx 
(crh), crh receptor 1 (crhr1),  xxxg1801xxx  (pomc),  xxxg1385xxx  ( xxxg1385xxx ), c-jun
and c-fos. the suitability of these molecular markers was determined in neonatal pigs which were
maternally deprived for two hours. it was found that maternal deprivation caused significantly higher
transcript levels of c-fos and crh in brain accompanied by a down-regulation of crhr1 mrna and
an up-regulation of c-jun in the pituitary gland. to determine the effect of elevated maternal cortisol
levels on gene expression of these molecular markers in fetuses, pregnant sows were treated with 100
iu acth (synacthen1 depot) s.c. every two days between day 49 and day 75 of gestation (normal
gestation length 114 days). animals were killed 48 hours after the last acth administration and
fetuses of each sow were isolated. the acth treatment of sows significantly increased mrna
expression of c-fos but not of crh in the fetal brain, and significantly decreased  xxxg1385xxx  mrna
expression in the adrenal gland. however, hpa axis seems not to be fully developed in day 77-fetuses

because fetal pituitary crhr1 and pomc mrna expression was low in most of the fetuses. although
the expression of endocrine regulatory factors was partially incomplete in fetuses at the beginning of
the third-trimester, acth dependent activation of c-fos mrna in brain indicates a stress-related
increase of neuronal activity. based on these results it is assumed that prenatal stress in pigs may also
have effects on the activity of the hpa axis in the offspring.

1. introduction
the activation of the hypothalamo–pituitary–adrenal (hpa) response to stress is under
central regulation. stress-related stimuli facilitate the hypothalamic secretion of crh
which stimulates pituitary acth secretion through type 1 crh receptors [1]. pomc
synthesized in the brain and pituitary gland is the pro-hormone for acth [2], and in the
adrenal gland the  xxxg1385xxx  is involved in biosynthesis and release of glucocorticoids.
maternal stress during gestation was found to cause short-term and persistent effects on
the behaviour, physiology and performance in the offspring of many species e.g., [3–6].
the hpa axis has been proposed as a possible neurobiological substrate for these
physiological and behavioural consequences of prenatal stressful events [4,7]. although
several stress-induced factors, e.g., neurotransmitters, opioids and neurosteroids were
assumed to be involved in long-term changes of the hpa axis, it was shown that maternal
glucocorticoids play a major role in mediating the effects of maternal stress to the fetuses
[8,9]. they are able to cross the placental barrier in various species, e.g., rats [10], sheep
[11], pigs [12,13], and numerous studies have shown that excess levels of these maternal
hormones can cause a dysregulation of the hpa axis response in the offspring [4,5,7].
in livestock farming, many management practices are considered to be stressful to farm
animals [14,15]. housing conditions, handling by humans and disruption of social contacts
during gestation may influence the performance, behaviour and stress susceptibility of the
offspring. therefore, prenatal stress in farm animals may affect economic aspects of
production as well as animal health and welfare. furthermore, livestock species such as
pigs may serve as an appropriate model for studying effects of prenatal stress in humans
due to many similarities in physiology and development.
in pigs, prenatal restraint stress during late gestation resulted in a dysregulation of the
hpa axis shortly after birth, an impaired immune response and a higher morbidity and
mortality during the suckling period [16–18]. in addition, it was shown that acth
injections in combination with restraint during mid-gestation of sows caused long-term
effects with higher adrenal cortex-to-medulla area ratios, increased plasma cortisol
concentrations after regrouping of animals and delayed wound healing in the offspring
[19]. based on these results it is assumed that prenatal stress in pigs may have a profound
influence on the hpa axis activity in the offspring.
because no information is available about the expression of stress-related genes during
fetal development of pigs, this study was conducted to examine the mrna abundance of

1222

m. schwerin et al. / theriogenology 63 (2005) 1220–1234

genes serving as markers of hpa function in porcine fetuses (day 77 of gestation) from
sows which were repeatedly treated with acth and from control sows. the mrna
expressions of these following markers were studied: crh in whole brain, crh receptor 1
(crhr1) and pro-opiomelanocorticotropin (pomc) in pituitary, and  xxxg1385xxx 
( xxxg1385xxx ) and crhr1 in adrenal. the transcription level of the immediate early genes c-fos
and c-jun was studied in whole brain and pituitary gland, respectively, as markers for
neuronal activity. in a first experiment the suitability of these biological markers was
determined to characterize the response of hpa axis in maternal deprived piglets.

2. material and methods
2.1. animals, housing and treatment
2.1.1. pregnant sows
randomly selected german landrace sows (n = 11) inseminated with sperm from german
landrace boars and their litters were used in this study. pregnant sows were individually
housed in pens (1.2 m  2.0 m) on partially slatted floor. animals were fed a commercial diet
at a normal ration for pregnant sows. feeding times were set at 07:00 h and 16:00 h and water
was available ad libitum. these sows, which were allowed to farrow, were moved to
individual farrowing pens (2.0 m  3.0 m) and stayed there with their litters.
2.1.2. neonatal piglets
eight male piglets from four sows (litter size: 8–10 piglets) were used to determine the
effects of an acute stressor (maternal deprivation) during the suckling period on the gene
expression. at the age of 21 days, two male piglets were randomly selected from each litter
(mean body weight: 6.57  0.38 kg). one piglet from each litter was isolated from the
mother and siblings for two hours, whereas the other selected piglet served as a control.
the isolated piglets were transported in a carrying cage from the farrowing pen to a test
room, separated from the housing compartment. here, each piglet was placed alone in a
darkened plastic box (0.60 m  0.40 m  0.32 m) with sawdust on the floor. the control
piglets were left undisturbed in the farrowing pen during this time. immediately before
(0 h) and after (2 h) the social isolation treatment blood samples for the analysis of plasma
cortisol concentrations were taken in a supine position by anterior vena cava puncture (the
whole sampling procedure lasted approximately 30 s). blood samples from control piglets
were taken analogous to these times. immediately after the second blood sample animals
were euthanized by an intravenous injection of t61 (embutramide/mebezonium iodide/
tetracaine hydrochloride, intervet, unterschleissheim, germany) and whole brain, pituitary and adrenal glands were quickly removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
80 8c. all experimental procedures on the animals were performed between 08:00 and
11:00.
2.1.3. prenatal acth treatment and recovery of fetuses
seven sows were used to determine gene expression during mid-gestation of day 77
fetuses from sows after repeated acth administration and from control sows. five days

before starting the experiments sows were surgically fitted with an indwelling jugular vein
catheter [20] under ketamin/xylazin anaesthesia. the external outlet of the catheter was
placed in a small cotton bag on the neck. catheters were flushed daily with sodium citrate
solution.
during mid-gestation starting at day 49 four sows received repeated s.c. administrations
of synthetic acth (synacthen1 depot, novartis, brussels, belgium) at a dose of 100 iu
diluted to 2 ml with physiological saline. this treatment was repeated every second day
until day 75 of gestation. administrations of acth were given in the neck at 08:00 h. the
other three sows served as an untreated control. it was already shown in a previous study by
our group that these repeated acth administrations during mid-gestation result in a
consistent cortisol response throughout the treatment period and that the repeated injection
of saline has no effects on the cortisol response compared to untreated control sows [13].
blood samples (2 ml) were collected on treatment days immediately before acth
injection, thereafter in a 30 min interval till 10:00 h, hourly till 14:00 h, and at 16:00 h.
at day 77 of gestation sows were slaughtered, exsanguinated and uteri were quickly
removed and placed on ice. in total 27 male fetuses (13 of unstressed and 14 of stressed
sows) were obtained with the number of male fetuses per sow ranging from 2 to 5. whole
brain, pituitary and adrenal glands were removed quickly, frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at 80 8c.
all procedures involving animal handling and treatment were approved by the
committee for animal use and care of the agricultural department of mecklenburgvorpommern, germany, according to the german law for animal protection (tierschg).
2.2. blood sampling and cortisol analysis
blood samples of sows and suckling piglets were collected in ice-cooled polypropylene
tubes containing edta solution, immediately placed on ice and subsequently centrifuged
at 2000  g for 15 min at 4 8c. plasma was then stored at 20 8c until analysis. plasma
cortisol levels were obtained using a commercially available radioimmunoassay kit (drg
international, inc., usa) with a highly specific cortisol antibody and a detection threshold
of 0.3 mg/100 ml. the intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were 5.3% and 9.8%,
respectively.
2.3. rna isolation and real-time rt-pcr
cellular rna was extracted from tissue (whole brain, pituitary gland, adrenal) samples
using the rneasy total rna kit (qiagen, hilden, germany) according to the manufacturers instructions. the brain expression analysis in the present study does not distinguish
between the different brain areas because of the small size of this organ in the fetuses
analysed and the close topographical relationship between the different brain regions.
synthesis of first strand cdna was performed with mmlv-rt (promega, madison, usa)
and random hexamer primers using 2 mg total rna. quantitative analysis of pcr products
was carried out in the lightcycler1 (roche, mannheim, germany) according to optimised
pcr protocols using the specific primers of the corresponding molecular marker (table 1)
and lightcycler dna master sybr green i1 (roche, mannheim, germany).

for lightcycler reactions a master-mix of the following reaction components was
prepared to the indicated final concentration: 12.6 ml water, 2.4 ml mgcl2 (4 mm), 0.5 ml
forward primer (0.6 mm), 0.5 ml reverse primer (0.6 mm), and 2.0 ml lightcycler dna
master sybr green i (1). eighteen microliter lightcycler master-mix was filled in the
lightcycler glass capillaries and 10 ng reverse transcribed total rna in 2 ml was added as
pcr template. based on the analysis of melting curves of the pcr products a high
temperature fluorescence acquisition point was estimated and included to the amplification
cycle program (table 1). high temperature fluorescence acquisition melts the unspecific
pcr products, eliminates the non-specific fluorescence signal derived from primer dimers
and ensures an accurate quantification of the desired specific gene products only. for all
assays an external standard curve was used based on a single stranded dna molecule
calculation. external dna standard dilutions of each recombinant plasmid from single
stranded dna (101, 102, 103, 104, 105, and 106 copies) were generated from the cloned rtpcr products into puc18 vector (pharmacia, freiburg, germany), linearised by a unique
restriction digest. fluorescence signals, which were recorded on-line during amplification,
were subsequently analysed using the ‘‘second derivative maximum’’ method of the
lightcycler data analysis software. copy numbers were calculated relative to the amount
of total rna. copy number of the housekeeping gene  xxxg861xxx  was measured to normalize
for equal rna amounts. the mrna abundance was analyzed in three independent
repeated analyses.
2.4. data analysis
plasma cortisol concentrations, transcript levels of neonatal piglets and transcript levels
of fetuses were analysed by the mixed model procedure of sas [21]. the model included
the fixed effects of the factors ‘treatment’, and ‘sow’ nested within ‘treatment’. plasma
cortisol concentrations of sows were analysed by the glm procedure for repeated
measurements. this model included the fixed factor ‘treatment’ and the repeated factor
‘sampling time’. the data are expressed as least square means  s.e.m. significance was
accepted at p < 0.05.

3. results
3.1. maternal deprivation significantly affects mrna abundance of
genes related to hpa axis in piglets
stress-induced activation of hpa axis by maternal deprivation increased the plasma
cortisol concentrations in piglets (fig. 1). maternal deprivation for 2 h yields to a 6-fold
increased plasma cortisol level whereas cortisol concentration remains nearly unchanged
in the unstressed siblings.
the mrna abundance of crh, crhr1,  xxxg1385xxx  and of the early genes c-fos and c-jun
were analysed by rt-pcr in brain, pituitary and adrenal gland. maternal deprivation
caused both a significant higher transcript level of crh mrna in the brain and a
significant lower transcript level of crhr1 mrna in pituitary gland. these changes

are coincident with increased levels of c-fos mrna in brain and c-jun mrna in pituitary
gland of the stressed siblings, respectively. the adrenal mrna abundance of  xxxg1385xxx  and
crhr1 was not significantly different between the stressed and unstressed siblings
(fig. 2).
3.2. gestational acth administration to pregnant sows alters only in part mrna
abundance of genes related to hpa axis in their fetuses (day 77 of gestation)
the plasma cortisol levels after acth administration in chronically catheterised sows
are shown in fig. 3. the stimulation with acth caused a pronounced increase of plasma
cortisol levels after 30 min until eight hours post injection compared to the untreated
control sows. no habituation of cortisol responses was found over the treatment period as
shown by the cortisol release course of the first and the last treatment day.
the effect of elevated maternal cortisol on fetal hpa axis was investigated after
application of acth every two days between days 49 and 75 of gestation. the transcript
levels of crh, crhr1,  xxxg1385xxx , c-fos and c-jun serving as molecular markers of hpa axis
and neuronal activity were analysed 48 h after the last acth application in day 77 fetuses
in brain, pituitary and adrenal. fetal mrna level of c-fos in brain showed a significant
increase (p < 0.05) in fetuses from acth-treated sows, whereas adrenal  xxxg1385xxx  level was
significantly lower (p < 0.001) as compared to the control group. furthermore, c-jun
mrna in pituitary was in tendency increased in fetuses from acth-treated sows
compared to the control fetuses (p = 0.0625). brain crh mrna and adrenal crhr1
mrna transcript levels did not differ between both groups (fig. 4).

maternal deprivation (2 h) were compared to untreated siblings (unstressed piglets, n = 4). quantitative analysis of

whereas individual data (number of transcripts/10 ng cellular rna) both of c-fos and
crh in brain showed a moderate variability corresponding to variation coefficients of 13.9
and 64.2%, the transcript levels of crhr1 and pomc in pituitary exhibited an extreme
variability corresponding to variation coefficients of 196.1 and 236.7%. this high
variability was caused by very low mrna transcript levels in 24 fetuses but high mrna
levels in three fetuses (fig. 5).

4. discussion
to study the stress-induced effects on expression of molecular markers of neuronal
activity and of the hpa axis in porcine fetuses and neonates rt-pcr assays were
developed for c-fos mrna, c-jun mrna, crh mrna, crhr1 mrna,  xxxg1385xxx  mrna,
pomc mrna and their transcript levels were studied in brain, pituitary and adrenal gland.
although the conclusions may be limited due to the small number of sows and the use of
male fetuses and piglets only, this initial study was conducted because knowledge about
stress-related gene expression and variation of these markers in porcine fetuses is necessary
for understanding the molecular mechanisms of long-term effects of maternal stress in
pigs.
the chosen molecular markers were approved in an experiment with neonatal pigs to
study the effect of maternal deprivation on their expression. maternal deprivation caused
significant higher transcript levels of crh mrna and c-fos in brain. the observed c-fos
activation is consistent with previous reports on maternal deprivation in rats [22,23],
whereas the crh mrna expression was decreased [23,24]. the up-regulation of the crh
mrna in our study was accompanied by a down-regulation of crhr1 mrna in the
pituitary gland. this is in line with earlier findings in rats, where injections of either crh
or glucocorticoids induced crh binding and crhr1 down-regulation [1]. the adrenal
mrna abundance of  xxxg1385xxx  and crhr1 was not significantly different between the
stressed and unstressed siblings probably due to the short time course after maternal
deprivation [24].
based on these results these molecular markers were applied to determine the effect of
elevated maternal cortisol levels on fetal hpa axis in swine. stress in prenatal or early in
postnatal life may result in long-term alteration of emotional reactivity, immune response,
reproductive capacity, behaviour and dysregulation of hpa axis activity, e.g., [4–7,25].
the mechanisms involved are poorly understood, but it is assumed that maternal
glucocorticoids have the potential to affect the maturation of the fetal hpa axis, which
in turn may alter hpa function later in life. the present results demonstrate that exogenous
acth during mid-gestation results only in a low or incomplete expression of endocrine
regulatory factors of hpa axis. adrenal  xxxg1385xxx  expression was significantly decreased in
fetuses from acth-treated sows, whereas crh mrna levels in brain and adrenal crhr1

courses for cortisol levels are presented as means of all treatment days of the 28-day treatment period as well as for
the first and last treatment day. asterisks indicate significantly different means (*p < 0.05) between both groups at
the corresponding time after acth administration.

control sows.

mrna levels were not different between both groups. the decreased adrenal  xxxg1385xxx 
mrna expression was comparable with results in rats where a down-regulation was found
after dexamethasone treatment and after chronic stress [26,27]. however, it has also been
reported that chronic glucocorticoid treatment may up-regulate the  xxxg1385xxx  mrna
[28]. the reduction of adrenal  xxxg1385xxx  mrna in fetuses from acth-treated sows in our
study may indicate a dysfunction of the glucocorticoid feedback regulation with consequences for the adaptation of the hpa axis to stress.
the fetal pituitary crhr1 mrna and pomc mrna expression failed in most of the
day 77-fetuses indicating that pituitary seems to be not fully developed in porcine fetuses
at the beginning of the third trimester. however, an onset of pituitary pomc and crhr1

1232

m. schwerin et al. / theriogenology 63 (2005) 1220–1234

transcription was observed in three fetuses, with comparable expression levels to newborn
pigs (unpublished data), indicating an ongoing maturing process of the hpa axes at this
stage of gestation. the observed lacking of crhr1 mrna and pomc mrna transcripts
in the porcine mid-trimester fetuses seems to be in contrast to recent data in humans
suggesting that the fetal hpa axis is active early [29]. however, in situ hybridisation and
immuno-histochemical studies in the ovine fetal pituitary gland provided evidence for
differential processing of pomc in a tissue specific manner during early fetal pituitary
development [30]. for example, in the basal region of the pars distalis, pomc mrna
expression was high at day 40, declined by day 50 and then increased progressively to day
141 of gestation.
additionally, in response to the acth administration to pregnant sows, the c-fos
expression was significantly increased in the fetal brain. a marked activation of fetal brain
c-fos was also found after dexamethasone administration at a low dose to pregnant rats
[31]. the induction of transcription factors like c-fos in brain areas may have long-lasting
effects on the stress response by altering the expression of transmitters, receptors and
neuropeptides [32]. time course studies showed that in most cases c-fos was expressed
within 30 min and decreased after 60 min [33,34]. however, a prolonged or persistent c-fos
response depending on the stressor specificity was shown in fetal rats [31] and in mice [35]
that corresponds with the observed elevated levels in the fetuses at day 77 in the present
study and may be indicative of secondary neuronal activation [33].
in summary, the present findings indicate that maternal deprivation in male neonatal
pigs causes alterations of crh mrna and c-fos expression in brain and of crhr1 mrna
and c-jun expression in pituitary. furthermore, repeated acth administration to sows
between days 49 and 75 of gestation affects the induction of c-fos expression in brain and
 xxxg1385xxx  expression in adrenal gland of male fetuses. in the light of the observed
inactivity of the pituitary crhr1 and pomc, as essential components of the hpa axis in
the day 77-fetuses, it remains unclear if these observed limited alterations in endocrine and
neuronal response might alter hpa function later in life. however, acth dependent
activation of c-fos mrna in brain indicates a stress-related increase of neuronal activity in
fetuses, which might modify behaviour, physiology and performance of animals later in
life. in further studies, long-term effects of acth application to pregnant sows on the hpa
axis and neuronal stress response in the offspring will be determined.
