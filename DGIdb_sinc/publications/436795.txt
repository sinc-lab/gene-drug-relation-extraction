synopsis
this

study

was

designed

to

investigate

the

chromatin

transcription

in vitro

by

progesterone-receptor
complex
in the estrogen-primed
rabbit uterus.
rna synthesis
by the uterine
chromatin
was stimulated
when progesterone-uterine
cytosol complex
was bound to the chromatin
and the stimulation
was dependent
upon the dose of
the bound
progesterone-cytosol
8s complex
and upon the incubation
time of the
complex
in the presence
of the chromatin.
either norethindroneor dydrogesteroneuterine
cytosol
complex
also stimulated
the uterine
chromatin
transcription
but the
extent
was less than that
of progesterone
complex.
these results
indicate
that
progesterone
as well as synthetic
progestogens
can directly
regulate
scription
via progesterone
receptor
in the rabbit uterine
cells.

transcriptional changes at the levels of
nuclear rna, rna polymerase activity
and/or chromatin template activity have
been recognized to occur prior to the synthesis of progesterone-induced protein, e.g.
avidin in chick oviduct (o'malley and
kohler, 1967) and blastokinin in rabbit
uterus (krishnan and daniel, jr., 1967).
the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of progestogen on the
transcription, namely the chromatin template activation
by progestogen-receptor
complex in the estrogen-primed
rabbit
uterus.

the gene becomes active in the next step.
progesterone stimulates in vitro rna synthesis in the chick oviduct (o'malley et
al., 1968; o'malley and mcguire, 1969).
recently schwartz et al.(1976)
demonstrated that purified progesterone-receptor
complex stimulated transcription of oviduct
chromatin in vitro and showed that progesterone-receptor complex could directly
regulate gene transcription.

discussion

we have studied about the progesterone
receptor in the rabbit uterus, namely
general characters (ishihara et at., 1973;
tamaya, 1975; tamaya et al., 1977), translocation to the nuclei and binding to
chromatin of the receptor (tamaya et al.,
1975).

progestogen-receptor

progesterone-8s and -5s binders exist
in the uterine cytosol and the former binds
to the uterine chromatin much more than
the latter does (tamaya et al., 1975).
therefore the collected 8s solution could
be used as a receptor solution especially
in the experiment to examine receptor-dose
dependent rna synthesis, to the aviod
influence of 5s protein.
we presented here an evidence that progesterone-cytosol or-8s complex stimulated
the chromatin rna transcription in the
estrogen-primed rabbit uterus in vitro. this
stimulation was a dose-dependent and timedependent process.
ent is known to be one of potent
progestogens in estrane series and it is
considered in the rabbit uterus that the
biological effect is achieved via  xxxg1737xxx  (tamaya et al., 1977a),
and that ent- xxxg1737xxx  binds
to the chromatin (tamaya et al., 1977b).
 xxxd1957xxx  is also one of progestogens
in pregnane series and binds to  xxxg1737xxx  (ishihara et al., 1973). either
 xxxd1957xxx -or
ent-cytosol complex
stimulated the in vitro rna transcription
of uterine chromatin.
but the effects of
these progestogens were smaller than that
of progesterone-cytosol complex, as shown
in fig.6.
ent is10times as active (subcutaneous route) as progesterone in the
clauberg test (pincus et al., 1956), although
it was inactive in the mcginty intrauterine
test (mcginty and djerassi, 1958).  xxxd1957xxx  is25to34times
as active as
progesterone in the clauberg test (subcutaneous route)(reerink
et al., 1960) therefore the quantities of rna synthetized by
the three steroids did not relate with their
biological activities. we have demonstrated
that the antiprogestational steroids do not
stimulate the chromatin rna synthesis via
progesterone receptors in the rabbit uterus
(tamaya et al., 1978). then, the possible
explanation for the discrepancy is that it
may be due to the difference in the in
