whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were used to investigate the effects of the respiratory stimulant  xxxd1934xxx  on k ÷ and ca2+ currents m
isolated type i ceils of the neonatal rat carotid body.  xxxd1934xxx  (1-100/zm) caused rapid, reversible and dose-dependent inhibitions of k +
currents recorded in type i cells (icso approximately 13/zm). inhibition was voltage-dependent, m that the effects of  xxxd1934xxx  were maximal at test potentaals where a shoulder in the current-voltage relationship was maxamal. these k + currents were composed of both ca2+activated and ca2 + -mdependent components. using high [mg2 + ], low [ca2 + ] solutions to inhibit ca2+-activated k + currents,  xxxd1934xxx  was
also seen to directly inhibit ca2+-independent k + currents. this effect was voltage-independent and was less potent (ics0 approximately 20
/tm) than under control conditions, suggesting that  xxxd1934xxx  was a more potent inhibitor of the ca2÷-activated k + currents recorded under
control conditions.  xxxd1934xxx  (10/zm) was without effect on l-type ca2+ channel currents recorded under conditions where k + channel
activity was minimized and was also without significant effect on k + currents recorded in the neuronal cell  xxxg694xxx  ng-108 15, suggesting a
selective effect on carotid body type i cells. the effects of  xxxd1934xxx  on type i cells show similarities to those of the physiological stimuh of
the carotid body, suggesting that  xxxd1934xxx  may share a similar mechanism of action in stimulating the intact organ.
introduction
the carotid b o d y is the m a j o r peripheral arterial
chemoreceptor. it responds to changes in levels of arterial 0 2, c o 2 and p h by modulating the frequency of
discharge of afferent chemosensory fibres in the carotid
sinus nerve (csn), thereby exerting influences on the
pattern of breathing 6. the type i (or giomus) cells are
generally believed to play an i m p o r t a n t role in this organ's functioning; they lie in synaptic contact with afferent chemosensory fibres 14 and contain catecholaminefilled vesicles. the close correlation in b o t h time course
and magnitude between catecholamine release from type
i cells and elevation of csn discharge 7'26 has contributed to the idea that type i cells are responsible for detecting and transducing chemostimuli.
the patch-clamp technique has recently been applied
to the study of isolated type i cells, in o r d e r to determine the possible roles ion channels may play in
chemotransduction 4'9'12'25'2s. in most cases, physiological stimuli (e.g. hypoxia, acidity) have b e e n demonstrated to selectively inhibit k + channels, whilst other
channel types (ca 2÷ channels, and also n a ÷ channels in

adult type i cells) remain unaffected 3'9'12'13'19'20'23'28. in
type i cells isolated from the neonatal rat at least, the
effects of hypoxia and acidity are selective for charybdotoxin-sensitive (high conductance) ca2+-activated k ÷
channels 19,20,23.
d o x a p r a m hydrochloride ( xxxd1934xxx  hydrochloride hydrate, hereafter referred to as d o x a p r a m ) is a drug used
clinically to stimulate breathing in a variety of conditions. its stimulatory action has b e e n shown in anaesthetized animals to be due largely to a direct action on the
carotid b o d y 1°'16, where it causes an increase in the discharge of afferent chemosensory fibres in the csn, although at higher doses it can also stimulate central respiratory neurones. the mechanism of d o x a p r a m ' s action
on the carotid b o d y is at present unknown, but appears
to be i n d e p e n d e n t of the b a c k g r o u n d levels of o2 x6. the
present study was carried out to examine whether doxa p r a m alters the activity of ion channels in isolated type
i cells of the neonatal rat, in o r d e r to c o m p a r e its effects with those of physiological stimuli (see above). a
preliminary account of some of these findings has been
presented in abstract form 22.

materials and methods
the procedures for isolation and maintenance of type i cells in
short-term culture were as previously described 19"25. in brief, carotid bodies were removed from 8- to ll-day-oid rats (which were
anaesthetized by breathing 4%  xxxd1993xxx , 96% oxygen through a
face mask) and placed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pbs).
they were then cut into pieces and placed in ca 2+ and mg3+-free
pbs containing collagenase (0.03-0.05%) and trypsin (0.020.025%) at 37"c for 20-30 rain. after gentle trituration with a pasteur pipette, the dispersed cells were resuspended in ham's f-12
culture medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100
iu/rni), streptomycin (100/~g/ml) and insulin (84 u/l). they were
plated onto polylysine-eoated coverslips and kept at 37"c in a humidified incubator until required for study. electrophysiological recordings were made from cells kept in short-term culture for between 4 and 48 h. in some experiments, the effects of  xxxd1934xxx 
were investigated on ionic currents in the undifferentiated mouse
neuroblastoma x rat giioma hybrid cell line ng-108 15. these cells
were maintained in culture as previously described24, and recordings were made as for the type i carotid body cells.
fragments of coverslips to which cells had adhered were transferred to a recording chamber (volume approximately 80/zl) which
was continually perfused at 0.5 ml/min. whole-cell patch-clamp recordingss were made from the most numerous cell type, the phasebright, spherical type i cells, which were of approximately 10/~m
diameter~. patch electrodes had resistances of between 2 and 7
mq. to record k + currents, they were filled with a solution of (in
ram): kci, 107; cac12, 1;  xxxd2534xxx , 2; naci, 10; k-egta, 11;
hepes, 11; atp, 2 (ph 7.20). although this 'intraceuular' solution overestimated the ci- concentration found in these cellstm, it
was kept high to allow direct comparisons of the effects of  xxxd1934xxx  with previously published effects of physiological stimuli on
currents in type i cells obtained from neonatal rats 19'2°'z3'~. the
perfusate was of composition (in ram):  xxxg2020xxx , 135; kci, 5;  xxxd2534xxx ,
1.2; caci2, 2.5; hepes, 5 (21-24°c, ph 7.40). to record ca 2+independent k + currents in isolation21, the extracellular [ca2+] was
reduced to 0.1 mm and the [mg2+] was raised to 6 ram.
current flowing through ca 2+ channels were recorded using a
patch electrode filling solution of (in ram): csci, 130;  xxxg2020xxx , 10;
egta, 1.1; mgc12, 2; caci2, 0.1; hepes 10; atp, 2 (ph 7.2);
and the perfusate composition was (in ram);  xxxg2020xxx , i10; csci, 3,
baci2, 10; mgci2, 0.6; hepes, 5; tetraethylammonium- (tea-)
ci, 20 (ph 7.4). under these conditions, ba 2+ acted as charge cartier through ca 2+ channels and so the currents are referred to as
'ca2+ channel currents'. it was necessary to use ba 2+ as charge
carrier, because currents recorded using physiological levels of
ca 2+ were too small to be accurately measured. outward currents
were minimized by replacement of k + with cs + and addition of
tea [see ref. 15].
type i cells were voltage-clamped at -70 mv holding potential,
and whole-cell currents were recorded in response to 50 or 100 ms
step cl~anges in the membrane potential to various test potentials
as indicated in the results, applied at a frequency of 0.1 or 0.2 i-lz.
data were recorded on magnetic tape and current amplitudes measured off-line by computer ( xxxg2407xxx  software; j. dempster, strathclyde university) by averaging the near-steady current level over
the last 5-15 ms of the test pulse (under all conditions studied k +
and ca 2+ channel currents showed vtrtually no time-dependent decay). current-voltage (l-v) relationships were obtained for each
cell before, during and after bath application of  xxxd1934xxx  (1-100
/tm;  xxxd1934xxx , a.h. robins co., crawley, u.k.), and are plotted
following leak subtraction, which was performed by the appropriate scaling and subtraction of the average current amplitude evoked
by small depolarizing and hyperpolarizing steps applied at the beginning of each experiment in wmch a i - v relationship was obtained. in some experiments where k + currents were being studled, the membrane potential was repeatedly (0.1 or 0.2 hz) stepped
from -70 to +20 mv to examine the effects of various changes in
the bathing medium with time. at the test potential of +20 mv

fig. 2. current-voltage (i-v) relationships obtained m the same
type i cell using high [mg2+] (6 ram), low [ca2+] (0.1 mm) solutions before application of  xxxd1934xxx  (o), then during exposure to
10/zm (11) and then 100 #m (d)  xxxd1934xxx , and after returning to
 xxxd1934xxx -free solution (o). the inset shows example traces of the
currents from this type i cell, all recorded at the same test potential of +20 mv, under the 4 conditions plotted in the i - v relatmnships.

doses, k + currents were further reduced (figs. 1 and 4),
and indeed were almost completely abolished with 100
/zm  xxxd1934xxx . a s / k c a only accounts for up to 50% of
the total k + current at a given test potential 19, this indicated that the drug was also inhibiting/kv in type i
cells.
to examine any effects of  xxxd1934xxx  on the ca2+-in sensitive/k~ without contamination f r o m / k c a (or/ca),
recordings were made from cells bathed in high [mg2+],
low [ca 2÷] solutions (see materials and methods for
composition). under these conditions currents increased
with increasing test potential in a near-linear fashion
(fig. 2) and no shoulder was apparent at the lower positive test potentials. in the presence of  xxxd1934xxx  (e.g.
10 or 100/~m, fig. 2), k ÷ current amplitudes were reversibly reduced at all activating test potential values
examined, so that i - v relationships obtained in the presence of the drug were also near-linear but with a reduced
slope (i.e.  xxxd1934xxx  apparently reduced the underlying
channel conductance rather than its kinetics). unlike under control conditions (see above), the effects of  xxxd1934xxx  o n / k ~ were voltage independent: similar degrees
of current reduction were seen at every test potential
value studied, for any given dose of  xxxd1934xxx  (e.g. fig.

3).
fig. 4 shows dose-response curves for the effects of
 xxxd1934xxx  on k ÷ currents recorded in type i cells bathed
in control solutions (filled circles) and high [mg2+], low
[ca 2+] solutions (open circles). in control conditions,
 xxxd1934xxx  caused significant reductions at all concentrations tested (see legend to fig. 4 for details), and the

icso was approximately 13 /zm.  xxxd1934xxx  also produced a dose-dependent inhibition o f / k v recorded in
isolation, (ic5o approx. 20/zm), but its effects were not
significant at 1/zm. indeed, at all but the highest dose
(100/zm), the effects of  xxxd1934xxx  were significantly less
on /k v than on k + currents recorded in control solutions, when k + currents are composed of b o t h / k v and
/kca (p < 0.04 to p < 0.002, unpaired t-test's). this
suggested that  xxxd1934xxx  was a more potent inhibitor of
/kca than o f / k v. the dashed line in fig. 4 is a plot of
the mean effect of  xxxd1934xxx  on /kc~ alone, and was
calculated using the known effects of  xxxd1934xxx  o n / k ~
(open circles, fig. 4) along with the mean proportion of
total k + current that is attributable to / k v and /kca,
taken from previous studies 19'2° (see legend for further
details).
typical examples of the time course of inhibition of
type i cell k + currents by  xxxd1934xxx  are shown in fig.
5. under control conditions (fig. 5a), or using high
[mg2+], low [ca 2+] solutions (fig. 5b), bath application
always caused a rapid inhibition of k + current amplitudes, which was also quickly reversed on washout of the
drug (the bath exchange time was approximately 15 s).
these findings indicate that inhibition o f / k c a a n d / k v
by  xxxd1934xxx  is similarly rapid, and suggest that the effects of  xxxd1934xxx  on both channel types may arise due
to a direct blocking effect.
findings presented in figs. 1-5 indicate that  xxxd1934xxx  reversibly inhibits both /kca and /kv in type i
cells, and that the drug is a more potent blocker of/kca.

effects o f  xxxd1934xxx  on ca2+ channel currents in type i
cells
o n e possible explanation for the effects of d o x a p r a m
o n / k ~ (see above) is that the drug was inhibiting the
ca 2+ entry into t y p e i cells which is r e q u i r e d for activation o f this c o m p o n e n t of the k + current u n d e r the recording conditions described above. to investigate this
possibility, the effects of d o x a p r a m on current flowing
through type i cell ca 2+ channels were r e c o r d e d directly, using 10 m m ba 2+ as charge c a r d e r , and solutions designed to minimize contaminating currents flowing through o t h e r channel types (see materials and
methods). u n d e r these conditions, inward ca 2+ channel
currents are sustained throughout 50 ms depolarizing
step potentials, with no a p p a r e n t transient c o m p o n e n t
(fig. 6). previous studies have shown t h e m to be enhanced by the d i h y d r o p y r i d i n e agonist b a y k 864423,
indicating that the channels underlying these currents are
largely, if not exclusively, of the l-type 29. bath application of 10/~m d o x a p r a m (a dose which causes significant
reductions in ~
a n d / k v, see fig. 4) was without effect on these l-type currents (fig. 6). a lack of effect
was consistently seen in 14 cells tested, indicating that
the effects of d o x a p r a m o n / k c a (see above) did not result as a consequence of the drug inhibiting the ca 2+ influx required for activation of this c o m p o n e n t of the k +
current.

with vertical s.e.m. bars, taken from the number of cells tested as
indicated. the test potential values used for calculating the % reduction caused by  xxxd1934xxx  were always between +20 and +40

i-v curve was maximal), and was fixed at +20 mv for high [mg2+],
low [ca2+] solutions, as no shoulder was observed and the effects
of  xxxd1934xxx  on/kv were voltage independent (fig. 3). significant
reductions in k + current amplitudes caused by  xxxd1934xxx  under
control conditions are indicated by the filled stars: 3 stars, p <
0.02; two stars, p < 0.002; one star; p < 0.0001. significant reductions found under high [mg2+], low [ca2+] conditions indicated
by open stars: 2 stars, p < 0.0005; one star p < 0.0001 (n.s., not
significant). dashed  xxxg694xxx  connecting open square symbols represents the estimated dose-response curve for/kc= alone. this curve
was calculated from the two experimentally obtained dose-response

reversible inhibitions of k ÷ current amplitudes of between 3 and 11%. these findings suggest that  xxxd1934xxx 
shows at least some selectivity for k + channels in type i
carotid cells above those found in other neuronal tissue,

significant reductions in both/kc~ and/k~ in type i cells

currents in type i cells (figs. 1-5) were specific to this
tissue, any effects of the drug on ionic currents recorded
in other neuronal tissue were investigated, using the
mouse neuroblastoma x rat glioma hybrid cell line ng108 15. these cells are known to possess an array of ion
channel types, including ca2+-activated and ca2+-inde pendent k + currents 2. using control solutions, 100 ms
depolarizing step changes in membrane potential (0.2

k ÷ currents (fig. 7), which were preceded by transient
inward (na ÷ and ca 2+) currents. in 4 out of 8 cells
tested, 10/xm  xxxd1934xxx  was without discernible effect
on these k ÷ currents (e.g. fig. 7). however, in the remaining 4 cells the same dose of  xxxd1934xxx  caused small,

inset shows example traces from this same cell, under the two conditions indicated (test potential +20 mv).

results presented here show that  xxxd1934xxx  is a rapid
and reversible inhibitor of both ca2+-activated and ca 2÷independent k + channels (/kca and/kv) found in isolated type i cells of the neonatal rat (figs. 1-4). the
drug appears more potent in inhibiting/kca (ic5o approximately 5 gm) t h a n / k v (ic50 approximately 20 #m;
fig. 4). its effects appear to be selective for k ÷ channels in the type i cell, as it was without significant effect
on l-type ca z+ channel currents at a dose (10 #m)
which significantly reduced k + current amplitudes. furthermore, the actions of  xxxd1934xxx  on k + currents appears to show at least a degree of tissue selectivity: 10
#m  xxxd1934xxx  did not significantly affect k + currents
recorded in the neuronal cell line ng-108 15 (fig. 7).
this observation is in agreement with the fact that there
are few observable side-effects of the drug in patients
who required elevated ventilation. although the mechanisms of the effects of  xxxd1934xxx  reported here are at
present unknown, time course studies of its blockade of
b o t h / k c a a n d / k v (fig. 5) suggest that its effects may
arise either due to a direct action on these two channel
types, or by interaction with a closely coupled receptor:
a receptor-mediated action involving generation of second messengers would be expected to give rise to a
slower inhibition of these channels.
in order to explain how the effects of  xxxd1934xxx  reported here could lead to increased csn discharge, and
hence elevated ventilation 16, it is important to compare
the drug's action on type i cell ion channels with those
of the physiological stimuli of the carotid body. both
hypoxia and acidity suppress k ÷ channels in type i cells3'
9,12,13,19,20,23.28. in the neonatal rat these effects have
been shown by this laboratory to be selective for/kc~ t9,
20,23, whereas in a similar preparation used by other
workers 28 and also in long-term cultured type i cells
from fetal rabbits 9 the k ÷ current subtype suppressed by
hypoxia has not yet been fully characterized. in adult
rabbit tissue the effects of these stimuli have been demonstrated on a k + current remaining after run-down of
the ca 2÷ current, suggesting that the underlying k ÷
channel is not ca2+-activated ~3. single channel recordings have shown, in long-term cultured type i cells obtained from fetal rabbit tissue, that hypoxia inhibits a

121
large-conductance k + channel 3, and it should be noted
that the hypoxia- and a c i d - s e n s i t i v e / k ~ in neonatal rat
cells is also of high conductance, as it is inhibited by
charybdotoxin 19, a peptide toxin which selectively inhibits high conductance ca2+-activated k + channels.
apamin (another peptide toxin which only inhibits low
conductance ca2+-activated k ÷ channels) has no effect
in these cells 19. in every preparation thus far studied,
hypoxia or acidity have been shown to be without observable effects on the inward l-type ca 2+ current in
type i cells 9'12'23'28. thus  xxxd1934xxx , by inhibiting k ÷
and not ca 2÷ channels in type i cells, shows much similarity to the effects of physiological stimuli of the carotid
body.
suppression of high-conductance k + channels has
been proposed as the cause of type i cell depolarization
induced by hypoxia 3, and acidity, which also blocks such
channels (see above), can also depolarize these cells 5.
such an effect would presumably lead to the opening of
the voltage-dependent l-type ca 2÷ channels, and hence
ca2+-dependent transmitter release. such a model of
chemotransduction in type i cells has further support, in
the case of hypoxia at least, in that release of radiolabelled catecholamines in response to hypoxia can be inhibited by the l-type ca 2÷ channel antagonist  xxxd2737xxx  ~7. the observations reported in this paper would
suggest that  xxxd1934xxx , by inhibiting b o t h / k c a a n d / k v
in type i cells, may act in a similar fashion to the phys-

iological stimuli of the carotid body, but further experimentation (such as a study of the effects of  xxxd1934xxx 
on transmitter release from type i cells and the ca 2+dependence of any such effects) is required before such
a hypothesis for the actions of  xxxd1934xxx  can be validated.
furthermore, although the above-mentioned actions
of chemostimuli on ion channels in type i cells suggest a
stimulus-depolarization-secretion model for chemotransduction, there are alternative possible mechanisms for
such a process occurring in response to both acidic and
hypoxic stimuli. acidity has recently been demonstrated
to lead to elevated intracellular [ca 2÷] (and hence transmitter release) by reversing the operation of the na t ca 2÷ exchanger in the type i cell plasma membrane 27.
other workers have provided evidence that hypoxia
raises cytosolic [ca 2÷] by causing its release from intracellular stores, rather than stimulating its influx across
the plasma membrane 1. the effects of  xxxd1934xxx  on
membrane transporters and intracellular stores require
study before the relative importance of its actions reported here (or indeed those of hypoxia and acidity) on
ion channels in type i cells can be fully determined.
