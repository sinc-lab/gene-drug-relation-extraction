abstract
ingenol 3-angelate ( xxxd2356xxx ) is one of the active ingredients in euphorbia
peplus, which has been used in traditional medicine. here, we report the
initial characterization of  xxxd2356xxx  as a protein kinase c (pkc) ligand.  xxxd2356xxx 
bound to pkc-␣ in the presence of phosphatidylserine with high affinity;
however, under these assay conditions, little pkc isoform selectivity was
observed. pkc isoforms did show different sensitivity and selectivity for
down-regulation by  xxxd2356xxx  and phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx  13-acetate (pma) in
wehi-231, hop-92, and colo-205 cells. in all of the three cell types,  xxxd2356xxx 
inhibited cell proliferation with somewhat lower potency than did pma.
in intact cho-k1 cells,  xxxd2356xxx  was able to translocate different green
fluorescent protein-tagged pkc isoforms, visualized by confocal microscopy, with equal or higher potency than pma. pkc-␦ in particular
showed a different pattern of translocation in response to  xxxd2356xxx  and pma.
 xxxd2356xxx  induced a higher level of secretion of the inflammatory cytokine
 xxxg1181xxx  compared with pma in the wehi-231 cells and displayed a
marked biphasic dose-response curve for the induction.  xxxd2356xxx  was unable to
cause the same extent of association of the c1b domain of pkc-␦ with
lipids, compared with pma or the physiological regulator diacylglycerol,
and was able to partially block the association induced by these agents,
measured by surface plasmon resonance. the in vitro kinase activity of
pkc-␣ induced by  xxxd2356xxx  was lower than that induced by pma. the novel
pattern of behavior of  xxxd2356xxx  makes it of great interest for further evaluation.

introduction
the protein kinase c (pkc) family of serine/threonine kinases
plays a central role in mediating the signal transduction of extracellular stimuli that result in production of the second messenger diacylglycerol (dag). pkc isoforms are differentially involved in the
regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, cell survival, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis (1, 2). for example, elevation in pkc-␤ii is an
early event in colon carcinogenesis (3), overexpression of pkc-⑀
leads to increased sensitivity for epidermal carcinoma formation (4),
whereas overexpression of pkc-␦ decreases the susceptibility to
tumor promotion (5) and results in growth inhibition and differentiation (6). pkc-␩ is negatively involved in skin tumor promotion
through the stimulation of differentiation of keratinocytes, whereas
pkc-␣ and -␨ are frequently associated with cell survival and suppression of apoptosis (7–9). moreover, altered patterns of pkc
isozyme expression and/or activation were reported in many diseases,
including cancer, psoriasis, and diabetic retinopathy (2, 10, 11).
the profound role of pkcs in the regulation of cell proliferation,
differentiation, survival, and apoptosis makes them drug targets (12).
 xxxd377xxx  1, a functional antagonist of many pkc-mediated effects,
is in clinical trials as a cancer chemotherapeutic agent (13). the
pkc-␤-specific inhibitor ly333531 shows promise for prevention of
diabetic retinopathy and is also being evaluated for other indications
(11). short-chain substituted 12-deoxyphorbol derivatives such as

prostratin or 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate are antitumor promoting and may be of utility in combination with highly active
anti-retroviral therapy for aids (14). phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx  13-acetate
(pma) itself has been reported to have activity as a differentiating
agent for the treatment of human myeloid leukemia cells (15).
consistent with their somewhat different biological functions, pkc
isoforms differ in their structure, tissue distribution, subcellular localization, mode of activation, and substrate specificity (16 –18). the
dag-dependent pkc family members are composed of an nh2terminal regulatory domain containing a pseudosubstrate domain, a
phospholipid and dag-binding c1 domain, and a cooh-terminal
catalytic domain. the ca2⫹- and dag-dependent isoforms also contain a ca2⫹-binding c2 domain within the regulatory domain. in the
inactivated state of the enzyme (usually localized to the cytoplasm),
the pseudosubstrate domain of the regulatory region binds to the
catalytic domain, inhibiting catalytic activity. pkc is activated endogenously by dag, which likewise recruits pkc to the membrane
(translocation).
phorbol esters, tumor-promoting diterpene derivatives from plants
of the family euphorbiaceae, bind to the c1 domain in pkcs, as do
dags, and activate the enzyme in a phospholipid-dependent manner
(19 –22). although phorbol esters and related natural products appear
to be ultrapotent analogs of dags, it has long been recognized that
there is marked heterogeneity in the patterns of biological responses
induced by these agents (23). the most prominent example for the
divergent biological responses is provided by the bryostatins. bryostatins are more potent activators of pkc than are phorbol esters, but
they induce only a subset of biological responses typical for phorbol
esters and block in a dominant fashion the responses that they do not
induce (24 –26). the short-chain derivatives of 12-deoxyphorbol-13
monoesters, prostratin and 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate, are
potent inflammatory agents on mouse skin, but the inflammation they
induce is transient and they block tumor promotion induced by pma
(27). finally, phorbol esters with unsaturated side chains tend to be
inflammatory but nonpromoting (28).
recently, wada et al. (29) have reported that a  xxxd2925xxx  with
a hydrophilic 12-ester inhibited pkc activation by pma in vitro. such
behavior would be predicted based on the current understanding of
 xxxd2925xxx  action. it is well known from the crystallographic (30),
nuclear magnetic resonance (31), and modeling studies (32) of  xxxd2925xxx -pkc complexes that phorbol esters insert into a hydrophilic
cleft in the c1 domain. the  xxxd2925xxx  thus completes a hydrophobic surface on the upper surface of the c1 domain, promoting
membrane interaction. in addition, the ester chains of the ligand
further contribute to the hydrophobic surface, enhancing the membrane interaction. a hydrophilic ester or a short-chain ester decreases
this latter hydrophobic contribution, resulting in decreased membrane
stabilization. this structure activity relationship can explain why
phorbol esters with different side chains induce different biological
responses.
ingenol derivatives are structurally closely related to the phorbol
esters (33) but have been much less extensively investigated because
of their more complicated chemistry. ingenol 3-angelate (fig. 1) is
one of the active compounds from euphorbia antiquorum and euphorbia peplus, extracts of which have been used as traditional
medicines in treating a number of conditions, including warts, corns,

waxy growths, skin cancer, asthma, and catarrh (34 –36). ingenol
3-angelate was first isolated and characterized for inflammatory and
tumor-promoting activity by adolf et al. in the early 1980s (37). in
those studies, ingenol 3-angelate showed unusual biology in mouse
skin. it was highly potent in causing mouse ear inflammation, being
more toxic than the long-chain substituted derivatives, but the inflammation was transient, unlike that of pma. this transient inflammatory
activity and local toxicity of ingenol 3-angelate was reminiscent of
that of short-chain esters of deoxyphorbol (27). crude extracts from e.
peplus have been shown to be active against a variety of tumor cell
lines in vitro, including strains of malignant melanoma that are resistant to conventional therapeutic agents (38).
in this report, we have sought to further characterize the behavior
of ingenol 3-angelate. we find that ingenol 3-angelate is a potent
ligand for pkc. it displays a unique, biphasic pattern of induction of
interleukin (il)-6 compared with the typical  xxxd2925xxx  pma. it
induces a distinct pattern of pkc-␦ translocation compared with
pma. finally, it fails to stabilize the membrane interaction of the c1
domain of pkc with phospholipids to the same extent as does pma
or dag, functioning in this in vitro assay as a partial agonist.

for hop-92 cells) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (roche molecular
biochemicals, indianapolis, in). ec50 values were calculated using origin 6.0
(originlab corp., northampton, ma).
il-6 elisa. the concentration of secreted il-6 was determined in the
supernatant of wehi-231 cells using an il-6 elisa kit (biosource international inc, camarillo, ca). one ⫻ 105 viable cells/ml were plated in 6-cm
dishes, treated after 24 h with the specified concentrations of the drugs [final
solvent (dmso) concentration 0.1%] for the indicated times (3–9 h and 24 h),
after which, aliquots of supernatant were removed for il-6 determination. the
cells were pelleted from the supernatants by centrifugation at 1000 ⫻ g for 10
min. the il-6 concentration in the supernatants was measured following the
manufacturer’s protocol. during the optimalization of the assay, the il-6

concentration in the supernatants was determined in triplicates. later the il-6
concentration of the supernatants was determined as a single measurement in
each experiment or in duplicates for the experiments with the pkc inhibitors.

kd is the intersection of the straight line with the y axis, indicating the kd of
[3h]pdbu.
kinase assay. activation of purified pkc-␣ and pkc-␦ was assayed by
measuring the incorporation of 33p from [␥-33p 3000 ci/mmol]atp (icn) into
their specific peptide substrate as described previously (42). pkc-␣ activation
was measured using an assay mixture (50 ␮l) consisting of 20 mm tris-hcl
(ph 7.5), 0.25 mg/ml bsa, 7.5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm cacl2, 100
␮g/ml phospholipid (phosphatidylserine:phosphatidylcholine, 20:80 w/w, prepared by sonication), 0.03% triton x-100, 600 nm pkc selectide peptide
(calbiochem), atp (50 ␮m final concentration, 1 ␮ci) and ingenol 3-angelate
or pma (20 nm-40 ␮m) from appropriate dmso stocks, the final concentration of the diluent not exceeding 0.2%. the assay mixture (50 ␮l) used for
measuring pkc-␦ activity contained 20 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.5), 0.25 mg/ml
bsa, 7.5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm egta, 30 ␮m pkc-⑀ peptide
(calbiochem), 200 ␮g/ml phospholipid (phosphatidylserine:phosphatidylcholine 40:60 w/w), 0.03% triton x-100, atp (50 ␮m final concentration, 1 ␮ci),
and ingenol 3-angelate or pma (40 nm– 80 ␮m). the assay tubes were
incubated for 10 min at 30°c. the reaction was stopped by chilling on ice.
aliquots (25-␮l) were spotted onto de81 ion exchange chromatography paper
(whatman ltd., maidstone, england), followed by washing in 0.5% phosphoric acid three times for 5 min each. the bound radioactivity was measured
in a scintillation counter. in each single experiment, each ligand concentration
was assayed in triplicate and a dose-response curve was plotted.
preparation of lipid vesicles. different large unilamellar vesicles with
diameter of 100 nm, referred to as liposomes, were prepared for the surface
plasmon resonance measurements. the control vesicles contained 80 mol %
1- xxxd2832xxx -2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3- xxxd2929xxx  and 20 mol % 1-palmitoyl2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3- xxxd1857xxx ; and the pma-liposomes were made
by the addition of 0.25 mol % of pma to the control liposomes, and the
dog-liposomes were made by the addition of 4 mol % of dog to the control
liposomes. aliquots of lipids in chloroform were mixed and dried under a
stream of nitrogen, then were resuspended in 170 mm sucrose and 20 mm
tris-hcl (ph 7.4) to a concentration of 20 mm. the samples were vortexed for
30 s, were subjected to four freeze-thaw cycles by placing them in a 42°c
water bath and in dry ice alternately, and then were extruded 40 times through
two-stacked 0.1-␮m pore polycarbonate filters using a lipofast microextruder
(sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo) to form liposomes. specified concentrations
of liposomes refer to those of the constituent phospholipids.
biacore experiments using the cm5 chip. anti-gst antibody (4500 –
5000 resonance units) were covalently bound to the surface of the cm5 chip
according to the manufacturer’s protocol in hbs-ep buffer [150 mm nacl, 10
mm hepes, 3 mm edta, 0.005% surfactant p20 (ph 7.4)]. later on,
hbs-ep or filtered and degassed pbs [100 mm na2hpo4/nah2po4, 150 mm
nacl (ph 7.4) was used as running buffer at a flow rate of 20 ␮l/min. one
hundred twenty ␮l of 150 nm gst-fused c1b domain of pkc-␦ were injected
over the surface and were incubated for 2 min before the injection of 180 ␮l
of 0.75 mm pma- or dog-liposome with 0.1% dmso (control) or specified
concentrations of drugs in 0.1% dmso final concentration (10 nm-10 ␮m). in

membrane stabilization experiments, 0.5 mm of control liposomes were injected over the gst surface in the presence of specified concentrations of
ingenol 3-angelate and pma (0.1 nm-10 ␮m). the dissociation was observed
for 10 min. the c1b domain and the lipids were washed down after each run
with two 10-␮l injections of 10 mm glycine (ph 2.0). each sample was
followed by a control when the c1b domain was replaced with running buffer.
the sensorgram of the controls (measurement without c1b domain) was
subtracted from the sensorgram of samples (with c1b domain) during the
evaluation. the amount of bound liposome (resonance unit measured at the end
of injection) was plotted against the drug concentration. these experiments
were done on a biacore 1000 instrument.
biacore experiments using the l1 chip. a biacore 2000 instrument
(biacore inc.) was used to perform these experiments. control liposomes and
dog-liposomes of the same concentration were immobilized on flow cell 1
and flow cell 2 of an l1 chip using hbs-n buffer [10 mm hepes, 150 mm
nacl (ph 7.4); biacore inc.] as running buffer. before the injection of
liposomes, the flow cells were washed with 25 mm chaps for 1 min at a flow
rate of 20 ␮l/min. the lipid surface was prepared by the injection of 1 mm
liposome (240 ␮l) at a flow rate of 5 ␮l/min, followed by 1-min injection of
10 mm naoh at a flow rate of 50 ␮l/min to remove the nonbound liposomes.
two hundred ␮l of 300 nm purified c1b domain of pkc-␦ (diluted in running
buffer, containing 0.1% dmso for control or specified concentrations of the
drugs in 0.1% dmso final concentration) was injected over the surfaces at a
flow rate of 40 ␮l/min. the dissociation was monitored for 5 min. dmso or
the drugs were added to the c1b domain just before the injection. the lipid
surface was regenerated by a pulse of 25 ␮l of 10 mm glycine (ph 1.5) at a
flow rate of 50 ␮l/min. as the liposome surfaces became contaminated by the
drugs, a routine “desorb” procedure was run to clean the surfaces of the l1
chip and new liposomes were immobilized. during the evaluation, the resonance unit at the very beginning of the dissociation was plotted against the
drug concentration.
in the measurements of the direct binding of pma or ingenol 3-angelate to
the liposomes, the liposome surface was prepared as described, and 240 ␮l of
drugs at specified concentrations in 0.1% final dmso concentration, and
control containing 0.1% dmso, were injected at a flow rate of 40 ␮l/min; the
dissociation was observed for 10 min. the sensorgram of the dmso control
was subtracted from the sensorgram of samples and the resonance unitmax was
plotted against the drug concentration.
down-regulation of different pkc isoforms by ingenol 3-angelate and
pma. the down-regulation experiments were performed as described previously (43). briefly, wehi-231, hop-92, and colo-205 cells plated on 6-cm
dishes were treated with the specified concentrations of ingenol 3-angelate or
pma (0.1–1000 nm) for 24 h. after treatment, the cells were washed, total cell
lysates were prepared and analyzed on 10% sds-page, followed by electrotransfer and immunostaining. the primary antibodies used for immunostaining
were against pkc-␣ (c-20), -␤i (c-16), -␤ii (c-18), -␦ (c-20), -⑀ (c-15), and
-␮ (c-20), all from santa cruz biotechnology (santa cruz, ca). the immunostaining was visualized by ecl (amersham biosciences). the membranes
were immunostained with anti-actin antibody as a control for sample loading

binding of ingenol 3-angelate to pkc isoforms. we determined
the binding affinity of ingenol 3-angelate to pkc and its possible in
vitro selectivity among pkc isoforms. the pkcs were assayed in the
presence of phosphatidylserine (100 ␮g/ml), and the ki values were
measured by competition of [3h]pdbu binding. ingenol 3-angelate
bound to mouse pkc-␣ with high affinity; its ki was 0.10 ⫾ 0.02 nm
compared with a ki of 0.3 nm for phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. this
potent in vitro binding affinity is consistent with the impressive in
vivo inflammatory potency of ingenol 3-angelate on the mouse ear, for
which its ec50 (0.007 nmol/ear) is 2-fold more potent than that for
pma (0.016 nmol/ear), although the different time courses of action
prevent exact comparison (37).
to verify that the inhibition of [3h]pdbu binding by ingenol
3-angelate reflected a competitive mechanism, the apparent dissociation constant of [3h]pdbu was measured in the presence of increasing
concentrations (0, 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 nm) of ingenol 3-angelate. the
apparent kd values of [3h]pdbu were plotted as a function of the
concentration of ingenol 3-angelate (fig. 2b). consistent with a
competitive mechanism, the schild plot was linear, yielding a ki value
of 0.162 nm for ingenol 3-angelate, a value very similar to that
obtained above by competition at a fixed concentration of [3h]pdbu
(ki ⫽ 0.10 ⫾ 0.02 nm).
using commercially available purified human pkc isoforms, we
determined the isoform selectivity of ingenol 3-angelate under our in
vitro assay conditions. ki values were (nm) as follows: pkc-␣,
0.3 ⫾ 0.02; pkc-␤, 0.105 ⫾ 0.019; pkc-␥, 0.162 ⫾ 0.004; pkc-␦,
0.376 ⫾ 0.041; and pkc-⑀, 0.171 ⫾ 0.015 (fig. 2a). little in vitro
selectivity was thus observed.
down-regulation of different pkc isoforms. prolonged treatment with phorbol esters and other natural products is known to result
in down-regulation of different pkc isoforms (43, 45). we determined whether there was any isoform selectivity in down-regulation
caused by 24-h treatment with ingenol 3-angelate compared with
pma in three different cell lines, wehi-231, hop-92, and colo-205

cells. in all of the cell lines, pma and ingenol 3-angelate were able to
cause down-regulation of the tested classical and novel pkcs and to
change the mobility of pkc-␮ in a dose-dependent manner. there
were reproducible differences in the sensitivity and selectivity of the
isoforms to the drugs in the different cell lines (fig. 3; table 1). in
wehi-231 cells, ingenol 3-angelate was ⬃10-fold less potent than
pma in down-regulating conventional pkcs present in this cell line
(pkc-␣, pkc-␤i, and pkc-␤ii), with less (pkc-␦) or no (pkc-⑀)
apparent difference in their potency for novel pkcs (fig. 3a; table
1). similar changes were seen in hop-92 cells with some exceptions;
most of the isoforms (pkc-␣, -␤i, -⑀) were about 3–10-fold less
sensitive to the drugs than in wehi-231 cells, and the level of pkc-␦
was not changed with the treatments (table 1). a shift in the mobility
of pkc-␮ was caused by low concentrations of pma (0.3 nm) or
ingenol 3-angelate (1 nm) in both of the cell lines. we assume that this
shift is brought about by the phosphorylation of pkc-␮ by different
pkcs, as reported previously (46). as a matter of comparison of
isoforms, we observed marked differences in the sensitivity of the
different pkc isoforms to down-regulation by the treatments in these
two cell lines. for ingenol 3-angelate, pkc-␤i and pkc-⑀ were the
most sensitive, followed by pkc-␣ and pkc-␤ii. pkc-␦ and pkc-␮
were the least sensitive. phosphorylation of pkc-␮ was somewhat
more sensitive than was down-regulation of any of the pkc isoforms.
a markedly different pattern in isoform sensitivity and selectivity was
observed in colo-205 cells. pkc-⑀ was the most sensitive for the
ingenol 3-angelate treatment, followed by pkc-␦ and pkc-␮. the
classical pkc-␣ and pkc-␤i were the least sensitive in this cell line
(fig. 3b; table 1). furthermore, ingenol 3-angelate was about 10 –
30-fold more potent in down-regulating pkc-⑀ and -␦ than was pma,
having a modest biphasic effect on pkc-⑀ (fig. 3b).
translocation of pkc isoforms in living cells. distinct patterns
of translocation of pkc isoforms provide one mechanism that drives
distinct patterns of biological responses to ligands (44). we checked
the ability of ingenol 3-angelate to translocate different pkc isoforms
in intact cells in comparison with pma. gfp-tagged pkc isoforms
were transiently transfected into cho-k1 cells, and their translocation during ligand binding was visualized in real time using confocal
microscopy. in the absence of the ligands, most of the gfp-pkcs
were evenly distributed in the cytoplasm with a small proportion of
pkc-␦, -␮, and -␥ also being present inside the nucleus (fig. 4).
ingenol 3-angelate was very efficient in causing translocation of
different pkc isoforms. ten nm of the drug was able to translocate
pkc-␤, -␦, -⑀, and -␮ within 30 min (fig. 4a), and pkc-␣ and pkc-␥
were slightly less sensitive to the drug, showing significant translocation only at 100 nm (fig. 4b). pkc-␣, -␤, -␥, and -⑀ were translocated mainly to the plasma membrane with some intracellular patchy

gfp-tagged pkc isoforms were expressed in cho-k1 cells and after 48 h were treated with indicated concentrations of ingenol 3-angelate or pma for 45 min. translocation of
pkcs was followed by confocal microscopy. pictures were taken every 30 s. the time needed for visible translocation of different isoforms was determined in two or three independent
experiments.

interaction of ingenol 3-angelate with pkc

accumulation being present occasionally but with no localization to
the nuclear membrane (fig. 4, a and b). pkc-␮ first translocated
from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane and, after 30 – 40 min,
the pkc-␮ within the nucleus was lost with pkc-␮ appearing at the
nuclear membrane (data not shown). these translocation patterns in
response to ingenol 3-angelate were similar to the ones caused by
pma but the kinetics of translocation were much faster in the case of
ingenol 3-angelate, and a higher concentration of pma was required
for significant translocation (table 2). for pkc-␦, 10 nm ingenol
3-angelate caused rapid (3– 4 min) translocation from the cytoplasm to
the nuclear membrane, perinuclear regions, and some patchy intracellular organelles, reaching a peak after 10 –15 min. this was followed
by the appearance of some pkc-␦ in the plasma membrane and the
translocation of the pkc-␦ from within the nucleus to the nuclear
membrane at later time points (fig. 4c). at higher concentrations of
ingenol 3-angelate (100, 300, 1000 nm), the translocation of pkc-␦
was faster, and more gfp-pkc-␦ was found on the plasma membrane
compared with 10 nm ingenol 3-angelate-treated cells (table 2 and
data not shown). ten nm pma caused only very slow and limited
translocation of pkc-␦ (table 2 and data not shown); therefore, we
compared the translocation pattern in response to 10 nm ingenol
3-angelate with that of 100 nm pma (fig. 4c). pkc-␦ translocated to
the plasma membrane on treatment with 100 nm pma, reaching a
peak  xxxd1891xxx  min, followed by translocation to the nuclear membrane
concomitant with a decrease at the plasma membrane and within the
nucleus (fig. 4c).
different biological response caused by ingenol 3-angelate
and pma. the differences in translocation pattern of pkc-␦ and in
down-regulation of many pkc isoforms induced by ingenol 3-angelate and pma suggested that ingenol 3-angelate would cause a somewhat different pattern of biological responses compared with pma.
to evaluate this possibility, we first tested the effects of ingenol
3-angelate and pma on cell proliferation in different cell lines
(wehi-231, colo-205, and hop-92). ingenol 3-angelate inhibited
cell proliferation in the tested cell lines in a dose-dependent manner
with somewhat weaker potency than pma (fig. 5). there was also a
difference in the sensitivity of the cell lines to the drugs, the wehi231 cells being the most sensitive, followed by hop-92 and colo-205
cells. the ec50 values in wehi-231 cells were 0.499 ⫾ 0.144 nm for
pma and 1.41 ⫾ 0.255 nm for ingenol 3-angelate; in hop-92 cells,
they were 1.05 ⫾ 0.07 nm and 3.24 ⫾ 2.01 nm;, and in colo-205 cells,
they were 5.3 ⫾ 1.34 nm and 11.9 ⫾ 1.307 nm for pma and ingenol
3-angelate, respectively.
we next examined the effect of ingenol 3-angelate and pma on il-6
secretion of mouse pre-b wehi-231 cells. il-6 secretion was reported to
be regulated by phorbol esters and represents an important component of
the inflammatory response, including that in mouse skin after treatment
with pma (47, 48). wehi-231 cells were treated with different concentrations of ingenol 3-angelate (1 nm-1000 nm) or pma (0.3 nm-1000 nm),
and the secreted il-6 was determined by elisa after 3–9 and 24 h
incubation. wehi-231 cells secrete a basal amount of il-6 as reported
previously (49), and the concentration of il-6 in the supernatant increased with time (fig. 6a). a dramatic difference was observed in the
pattern of response to ingenol 3-angelate and to pma. ten and 30 nm
ingenol 3-angelate induced higher levels of il-6 secretion than any
concentration of pma at all time points up to 9 h. the dose-response
curve of ingenol 3-angelate for induction of il-6 secretion was biphasic.
one nm had no effect, 10 –30 nm caused the highest level of il-6
secretion, and higher concentrations were less effective. the biphasic
effect of pma was much less apparent. the biphasic dose-response curve
and the marked difference in il-6 secretion caused by the two ligands
disappeared after 24 h (fig. 6a, insert).

wehi-231 cells were treated with specified concentrations of ingenol 3-angelate and phorbol 12myristate 13-acetate (pma) for the indicated periods of time and the il-6 secretion in the
supernatant was measured. the concentration of
il-6 secreted into the supernatant was determined

the highest level of il-6 secretion at 6 h (fig. 6b). gö-6983 is a
general pkc inhibitor, with an ic50 value lower than 10 nm for the
classical and the novel pkcs, whereas gö-6976 has been reported to
be selective for the classical isoforms (50). the ic50 value of gö-6976
was reported to be 2.3 nm for pkc-␣ and 6.2 nm for pkc-␤i, with no
effect on the novel pkcs even at micromolar concentrations, as
reported by the manufacturer. neither of the inhibitors alone increased
il-6 secretion at any tested concentration after 6 h or 24 h (data not
shown) of treatment. the general pkc inhibitor caused complete,
dose-dependent inhibition of ingenol 3-angelate and pma-induced
il-6 production. the inhibitor selective for the classical isoforms only
partially inhibited the il-6 secretion caused by 10 nm ingenol 3angelate and was without effect in the case of 3 nm pma at the
concentrations tested. these results confirm that ingenol 3-angelateand pma-induced il-6 secretion through pkc activation and indicates some differences in the pattern of activation of different isoforms in vivo. a plausible explanation for the biphasic response for
il-6 secretion caused by ingenol 3-angelate is that different pkc
isoforms may positively or negatively regulate secretion, and ingenol
3-angelate and pma differ somewhat in their selectivity for particular
pkc isoforms.
stabilization of the interaction of pkc with membranes. in
elegant studies, bertolini et al. (51) demonstrated that phorbol esters
with hydrophilic patterns of substitution are less able to cause pkc to
associate with liposomes. because of the somewhat hydrophilic nature
of the ingenol 3-angelate, we tested the ability of ingenol 3-angelate

to stabilize the interaction of c1b domain with phospholipids using
surface plasmon resonance. in the first experimental approach, the
c1b domain of pkc-␦ was immobilized and liposomes were injected
over the surface in the presence of specified concentrations of ingenol
3-angelate or pma (0.1 nm-10 ␮m). ingenol 3-angelate and pma
increased the binding of the liposomes to the c1b domain of pkc-␦
in a biphasic manner (fig. 7a). two differences were apparent. first,
ingenol 3-angelate was somewhat less potent for inducing liposome
binding to the c1b domain. second, the maximal level of association
of the liposomes with the c1b domain of pkc-␦ was less for ingenol
3-angelate than it was for pma. we concluded that ingenol 3-angelate
was less efficient in inducing stabilization of the membrane interaction of the c1b domain.
if ingenol 3-angelate were less effective than pma at stabilizing the
membrane interaction of the pkc c1b domain, ingenol 3-angelate
should reduce the association of the c1b domain with liposomes in the
presence of pma. we, therefore, evaluated the effect of ingenol
3-angelate (10 nm-10 ␮m) on the binding of liposomes to the c1b
domain in the presence of 1.875 ␮m pma (pma-liposomes, 750 ␮m
in phospholipids and containing 0.25 mol % pma). increasing concentrations of ingenol 3-angelate indeed decreased the binding of
pma-containing liposomes to the c1b domain of pkc-␦ (fig. 7b),
with inhibition apparent at 100 nm. in the presence of 1 ␮m ingenol
3-angelate, the levels of binding of control liposomes and pmaliposomes to the c1b domain were similar (fig. 7c). functionally,
this behavior of ingenol 3-angelate is that of a partial agonist/antag-

onist of pkc. the behavior was similar both when hbs-ep buffer,
containing 0.005% surfactant p-20 (fig. 7b), or when pbs (data not
shown) was used as running buffer, except that the dissociation rate
was somewhat faster with the buffer containing the low amount of
surfactant. the liposomes were diluted in pbs in both cases. ingenol
3-angelate showed similar partial antagonistic behavior on the binding
of the biologically more relevant dog-liposomes (4 mol % of dog;
30 ␮m dog) to the immobilized c1b domain (fig. 7d).
we also evaluated the partial antagonism of ingenol 3-angelate on
the binding of the c1b domain to lipids using the reciprocal technical
approach, in which the lipids were immobilized on the surface and the
gst-fused c1b domain was in the soluble phase. the c1b domain of
pkc-␦ bound both to the control lipid surface and to the dog-lipid
surface in a dose-dependent manner (40 –1280 nm tested) with much
higher binding to the lipid surface containing dog (data not shown).
gst alone did not bind to any of the lipid surfaces (up to 2.5 ␮m; data
not shown). in the subsequent experiments evaluating the effect of
ingenol 3-angelate on the binding, 300 nm c1b domain was used.

consistently with the experiments in which the c1b domain was
immobilized, ingenol 3-angelate inhibited the binding of the c1b
domain to the dog-lipid surface and increased the binding to the
control lipid surface (fig. 8, a and b). indeed, 1 ␮m ingenol 3-angelate fully decreased the binding of the c1b domain to the dog-lipid
surface to the level of binding to the lipid surface without dog (fig.
8a). pma was also able to increase the binding of the c1b domain to
the control lipid surface and to decrease the binding to the dog-lipid
surface in a concentration-dependent manner (fig. 8c).
it should be noted that these systems are mechanistically complicated. the c1b domain can also bind to ingenol 3-angelate and pma
in the absence of lipid (unpublished data4 and ref. 40). ingenol
3-angelate and pma partition between the lipids and the aqueous
phase. the free concentrations of the ligands will depend on the
amounts bound to the c1b domain. nonetheless, it is clear that

3-angelate was injected. the same concentrations of ingenol 3-angelate without the protein were also injected over control-liposome and dog-liposome covered surfaces. the maximal
values of binding were plotted against the concentration. the concentration of dmso used as diluent was 0.1% in all cases. mean values and range of duplicate or se of triplicate
measurements run in a single experiment are shown. two additional experiments showed similar results. c, effect of pma on binding of the c1b domain to different liposomes; binding

pma without the protein were also injected over control-liposome and dog-liposome covered surfaces. the maximal values of binding were plotted against the concentration. the
concentration of dmso used as diluent was 0.1% in all cases. mean values and range of duplicate or se of triplicate measurements run in a single experiment are shown. one additional
experiment showed similar results.

ingenol 3-angelate could not cause the same degree of association of
the c1b domain with lipid that is induced by dag or pma. the basis
of the decrease in association of the c1b domain at high ligand
concentrations is uncertain, but optimal concentrations of different
activators for maximal activation have been reported previously (52,
53), suggesting submaximal effects at higher ligand concentrations. it
clearly does not appear to reflect a major change in the composition
of the bulk lipid phase, because the incorporation of the ligand into the
liposome in the absence of receptor was modest (see fig. 8, b and c).
the data emphasize that the behavior of phorbol esters and related
ligands at high concentrations is complex and emphasize the need for
caution in interpretation under such conditions.
in vitro kinase assay. finally, we compared the effect of ingenol
3-angelate and pma on the kinase activity of purified human pkc-␣
and pkc-␦ in an in vitro kinase assay. both compounds increased the
basal activity of pkc-␣ and pkc-␦ in a dose-dependent manner (fig.
9). ingenol 3-angelate caused lower increase in kinase activity of
pkc-␣ compared with pma, consistent with its lower potency in
stabilizing membrane interaction. no such difference was observed

with pkc-␦, in which ingenol 3-angelate was even slightly more
potent in inducing kinase activity, the maximum of activation being
similar.
discussion
ingenol 3-angelate is one of the active ingredients in e. antiquorum
and e. peplus, extracts of which have been used as traditional medicines in thailand and australia. in this paper, we report the initial
characterization of ingenol 3-angelate as a pkc ligand. we find
impressive potency of ingenol 3-angelate as a ligand for pkc, especially considering its relatively hydrophilic nature. ingenol 3-angelate
induces a different pattern of translocation of pkc-␦ in the cell,
compared with the pattern of pma, the typical tumor-promoting
 xxxd2925xxx . ingenol 3-angelate induces a higher level of secretion of

physiological regulator dag and was able to partially block the
association induced by these agents. the novel pattern of behavior of
ingenol 3-angelate makes it of great interest for further evaluation.
ingenol 3-angelate is a rather unusual hydrophilic ligand of pkc.
its calculated log p value is 3.89, much lower than that of for pma
(6.65, both calculated by chemdraw). its limited selectivity for different isoforms in vitro is like that of compounds such as (⫺)octylindolactam v (39), or the dag-lactone hk654 (54). it is important to
note that lack of selectivity in vitro does not necessarily predict lack
of specificity in the intact cell. although the dag-lactone hk654 did
not discriminate between different pkc isoforms in in vitro binding or
kinase assays, it showed pkc-␣ selectivity in translocation and apoptosis in lncap prostate cells (54).
prolonged activation of pkcs may cause down-regulation of different isoforms through calpain, caspases, and the proteosome pathway (55–57). different pkc activators behave differently in this
aspect. for example,  xxxd377xxx  1 is able to prevent pma-induced

down-regulation of pkc-␦ in some systems (45). ingenol 3-angelate
caused down-regulation of classical and novel pkc isoforms in three
tested cancer cell lines similarly to pma, but showing 1–30-fold
differences in the potency of the drugs. there were also pronounced
differences in the selectivity of the isoforms to the drugs in the
different cell lines highlighting that ingenol 3-angelate is not just
another  xxxd2925xxx  with different potency. these differences in
isoform selectivity should cause, in a dose-dependent manner, differences in the ratios of in situ activities of pkc isoforms. because
different pkc isoforms have somewhat different functions, this could
be reflected in biological differences, such as we indeed observed for
il-6 secretion.
one hallmark of pkc activation is translocation to membranes (58,
59). most inactive isozymes are localized to subcellular structures
and, on activation, translocate to new distinct intracellular sites depending on the stimulus and the specific anchoring proteins. for
example, pkc-␣ was shown to translocate to the plasma membrane or
to adhesion foci (for review see ref. 60), pkc-␦ translocated to the
plasma membrane, nuclear membrane, and mitochondrial membrane
(depending on the system; refs. 44, 61, 62), pkc-⑀ associated with
the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton (for review see ref. 63).
the substrate specificity of pkcs will depend in part on their localization, because the localization will determine which potential substrates are accessible to the enzymes (64). different patterns of translocation would thus be expected to lead to somewhat different
biological responses, and, indeed, one mechanism for antagonism
would be to localize an activated pkc to a cellular compartment in
which its normal substrate is not found.
different pkc ligands drive different patterns of pkc localization,
at least in the case of pkc-␦ (62). although most of the structural
features of ligands determining the different patterns of pkc localization remain uncertain, lipophilicity is clearly one critical element
(44). ingenol 3-angelate is more hydrophilic than pma, and the
translocation pattern was found to be similar to that caused by more
hydrophilic  xxxd2925xxx  derivatives, such as 12-deoxyphorbol 13phenylacetate or pdbu in cho cells expressing different gfp-tagged
pkc isoforms. the difference in the translocation pattern of pkc-␦
could contribute to the different pattern of biological response of
ingenol 3-angelate compared with the more hydrophobic phorbol
esters.
phorbol esters are known to cause differentiation, inhibition of cell
proliferation, and cell cycle arrest in different cancer cells. ingenol
3-angelate caused inhibition of cell proliferation in the three tested
cell lines (b cell lymphoma, colon cancer, and lung cancer) similarly
to pma with somewhat lower potency, behaving as a typical phorbol
ester in this aspect. there was a difference in the sensitivity of the cell
lines to the drugs, the wehi-231 cells being the most sensitive,
followed by hop-92 and colo-205 cells, consistent with the downregulation experiments.
inflammation was reported to be one of the prominent biological
responses to ingenol 3-angelate in mouse skin (37). il-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that acts on a wide variety of cell types. it has
important regulatory functions in the immune system exerting both
pro- and anti-inflammatory activity, is a mediator of the acute-phase
response, and is involved in the regulation of differentiation, proliferation, and survival of target cells (for review see refs. 65, 66). the
regulation of il-6 expression at the molecular level is complex
(67– 69). pma, as well as calcium ionophore and camp, was shown
to up-regulate il-6 gene expression in astrocytes (47, 70, 71), as well
as to increase il-6 mrna stability (72), showing that pma can
regulate il-6 secretion at multiple levels. different pkc isoforms
were shown to be involved in the regulation of il-6 secretion (73–76).
the results on pma-induced il-6 secretion in astrocytes or on pma-

interaction of ingenol 3-angelate with pkc

induced cytokine production in the el4 – 6.1 thymoma cell line (70,
77), as well as our data in wehi-231 cells, suggest that multiple pkc
isoforms are involved in the regulation of il-6 secretion in these cells,
some of them increasing, others diminishing il-6 secretion. the
different relative potencies of the two drugs for the different isoforms
and the different sensitivity of isoforms to the drugs could explain the
observed biphasic effect and the difference in response. whether
ingenol 3-angelate and pma behave differently for cytokine induction
in mouse skin remains to be determined, but it could plausibly
contribute to the toxicity of ingenol 3-angelate that was described.
dag and phorbol esters bind to the hydrophilic cleft of the c1
domain of pkcs, forming hydrogen bonds, and the 13-ester sidechain completes the hydrophobic surface of the protein (30 –32). the
continuous hydrophobic surface allows the insertion of the protein
into membranes and activation of enzyme activity. this membrane
stabilization contributes to the stabilization of the activated complex
and to substrate specificity, and molecules that bind to the c1 domain
but do not stabilize the interaction with the membrane should block
binding by other dag analogs and, at the same time, cause only
limited association of pkc-ligand complex with the membranes. the
overall result, therefore, could be partial agonism at the level of the in
vivo pkcs. the plausibility of this partial association with membranes
was previously shown (51). in addition, wada et al. reported (29) that
a  xxxd2925xxx  with a hydrophilic 12-ester chain could inhibit the
activation of pkc-␣ by pma. the consistent model that emerges
from the surface plasmon resonance (biacore) experiments is that
ingenol 3-angelate is able to bind to pkc but is less able to stabilize
its membrane interaction. it is clear, however, that the systems reflect
multiple actions of the ligands, because higher concentrations of either
of the phorbol esters suppressed the association with the lipids. the
difference in membrane stabilization presumably contributes to the
decreased ability of ingenol 3-angelate in activating pkc-␣ in an in
vitro kinase assay and an altered pattern of pkc-␦ localization.
natural products have provided an impressive window into the
extent of heterogeneity of biological response that can be elicited from
the pkc receptor family and the related receptors with dag-responsive c1 domains. as with the antipromoting 12-deoxyphorbol 13monoesters such as prostratin, the distinct behavior of ingenol 3angelate in the early characterization by adolf et al. (37) using the
mouse model is reflected in its novel behavior in biochemical and
cellular systems, as described here. the further characterization of
ingenol 3-angelate in a range of systems will help to define the extent
of its differences relative to compounds such as pma. ingenol derivatives have been relatively neglected compared with the phorbol
esters or teleocidins for structure activity analysis. evaluation of the
contribution of the ingenol scaffold to the special properties of ingenol
3-angelate represents a future challenge for pkc pharmacology. conversely, the concepts emerging from the behavior of ingenol 3-angelate provide strategies for drug design and screening using other
structural templates targeted to the c1 domain such as the constrained
dags (78). finally, ingenol 3-angelate, a constituent of the traditional
thai medicines “yang sa-lad-dai” and “yan nam radom pol” (37),
illustrates yet again in this era of combinatorial chemistry the wealth
of pharmacological leads afforded by traditional medicines.
