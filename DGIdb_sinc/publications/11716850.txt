abstract
 xxxd2654xxx  žkad-1229., a new anti-diabetic drug, is thought to stimulate insulin secretion by closing the atp-sensitive kq žk atp .
channels in pancreatic b-cells. however, its selectivity for the various k atp channels is not known. in this study, we examined the effects
of  xxxd2654xxx  on various cloned k atp channels žkir6.2rsur1, kir6.2rsur2a, and kir6.2rsur2b. reconstituted in cos-1 cells, and
compared them to another meglitinide-related compound,  xxxd2702xxx . patch-clamp analysis using inside-out recording configuration
showed that  xxxd2654xxx  inhibits the kir6.2rsur1 channel currents in a dose-dependent manner žic 50 value, 100 nm. but does not
significantly inhibit either kir6.2rsur2a or kir6.2rsur2b channel currents even at high doses žmore than 10 mm..  xxxd2702xxx 
inhibits kir6.2rsur1 and kir6.2rsur2b channels at 100 nm, and inhibits kir6.2rsur2a channels at high concentrations ž1 mm..
binding experiments on  xxxd2654xxx ,  xxxd2702xxx , and  xxxd3098xxx  to  xxxg19xxx  expressed in cos-1 cells revealed that they inhibit the binding
of w3 hxglibenclamide to  xxxg19xxx  žic 50 values:  xxxd2654xxx , 280 nm;  xxxd2702xxx , 8 mm;  xxxd3098xxx , 1.6 mm., suggesting that they all share
a  xxxd2215xxx  binding site. the insulin responses to glucose,  xxxd2654xxx ,  xxxd3394xxx , and  xxxd2215xxx  in min6 cells after chronic
 xxxd2654xxx ,  xxxd2702xxx , or  xxxd3098xxx  treatment were comparable to those after chronic  xxxd3394xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  treatment. these
results indicate that, similar to the sulfonylureas,  xxxd2654xxx  is highly specific to the kir6.2rsur1 complex, i.e., the pancreatic b-cell
k atp channel, and suggest that  xxxd2654xxx  may be a clinically useful anti-diabetic drug. q 2001 published by elsevier science b.v.

1. introduction
atp-sensitive kq žk atp . channels are present in many
tissues, including pancreatic b-cells žcook and hales,
1984., heart žnoma, 1983., vascular smooth muscle cells
žstanden et al., 1989., and other tissues žashford et al.,
1988; spruce et al., 1985.. k atp channels play an important role in various cellular responses such as secretion and
muscle contraction by linking cell metabolism to membrane potential žashcroft, 1988.. classical k atp channels
are now known to comprise two subunits: the  xxxg1250xxx

the sur žsur1 or  xxxg20xxx . subunits, the receptor of sulfonylureas žaguilar-bryan et al., 1998; ashcroft and gribble, 1998; seino, 1999.. coexpression of  xxxg1250xxx  and  xxxg19xxx 
in heterologous expression systems forms k atp channels
with properties similar to those in native pancreatic b-cells
žinagaki et al., 1995; sakura et al., 1995.. so far, various
forms of  xxxg20xxx  have been identified žchutkow et al., 1996,
1999; inagaki et al., 1996; isomoto et al., 1996.. it is
generally accepted that the kir6.2rsur2a channels form
cardiac and probably skeletal muscle k atp channels
žaguilar-bryan et al., 1998; ashcroft and gribble, 1998;
seino, 1999.. although it was proposed initially that the
smooth muscle k atp channels are kir6.2rsur2b channels žisomoto et al., 1996., the molecular composition of
the k atp channels in native smooth muscle has not been
determined. kir6.1 and sur2b are the constituents of the
vascular smooth muscle kq channel žyamada et al., 1997..

the k atp channels in pancreatic b-cells are critical in
the regulation of both glucose-induced and sulfonylurea-induced insulin secretions žmiki et al., 1998.. the binding of
sulfonylureas to  xxxg19xxx  probably inhibits the cooperativity
of the nucleotide binding folds žnbf.-1 and -2 of  xxxg19xxx 
that induces the closed state of the k atp channels žueda et
al., 1999.. recently, the non-sulfonylurea insulinotropic
agent meglitinide also has been shown to inhibit the b-cell
k atp channel by binding to  xxxg19xxx  žgribble et al., 1998..
 xxxd2654xxx  žkad-1229.,  xxxd2702xxx  ža-4166., and  xxxd3098xxx  are new anti-diabetic drugs that are related structurally to meglitinide but are different from the sulfonylureas. preclinical studies have shown  xxxd2654xxx 
to have an immediate and short-lasting effect on hypoglycemic action and to increase insulin release from both
pancreatic b-cells and hit-t15 cells žohnota et al., 1994,
1995..  xxxd2654xxx  has been shown to displace the bound
w3 hxglibenclamide in the mouse insulin-secreting cell line
min6 and to inhibit the k atp channel currents in these
cells žmogami et al., 1994., suggesting that it stimulates
insulin secretion by closing the k atp channels by binding
to the sulfonylurea receptors.
determination of the tissue selectivity of anti-diabetic
drugs that act through sulfonylurea receptors is critical in
predicting side effects since sulfonylurea receptors are
widely distributed in various tissues. the tissue specificity
of some sulfonylureas has been reported žgribble et al.,
1998; lawrence et al., 2001. but the tissue specificity of
 xxxd2654xxx  is not known. in the present study, we have
determined selectivity of  xxxd2654xxx  for various k atp
channels using cos-1 cells žsv 40-transformed african
green monkey kidney žagmk. cells. coexpressing cloned
 xxxg1250xxx  and  xxxg19xxx , sur2a, or sur2b. because it is
known that chronic treatment with sulfonylureas sometimes leads to impairment of sulfonylurea-induced insulin
secretion both in vivo and in vitro žkaram et al., 1986;
davalli et al., 1992; rabuazzo et al., 1992., we also
investigated the effects of chronic  xxxd2654xxx ,  xxxd2702xxx ,
or  xxxd3098xxx  treatment on insulin secretion and compared
the results with those of the sulfonylureas,  xxxd3394xxx  and
 xxxd2215xxx .

ever, the insulin responses to various stimuli after chronic
 xxxd2654xxx  treatment were comparable to those after  xxxd3098xxx ,  xxxd2702xxx ,  xxxd3394xxx , or  xxxd2215xxx  treatment. there was no significant difference in insulin content in min6 cells treated with each drug žfig. 6.. the
k atp channel conductance, normalized by dividing by the

1.01 " 0.37 nsrpf, n s 5., indicating that there was no
loss of k atp channels in min6 cells treated with  xxxd2654xxx .

4. discussion
we have shown that  xxxd2654xxx  inhibits kir6.2rsur1
žpancreatic b-cell type. k atp channels in a dose dependent-manner, but has no significant inhibitory effect on
either kir6.2rsur2a žcardiac and skeletal muscle type.
k atp channels or kir6.2rsur2b k atp channels even at
high concentrations ž100 mm.. in radioligand binding
assay,  xxxd2654xxx  inhibited the binding of w3 hxglibenclamide to  xxxg19xxx  expressed in cos-1 cells. the affinity of
human  xxxg19xxx  for  xxxd2654xxx  was about 500-fold higher
than that for  xxxd3394xxx , but 40-fold lower than that for
 xxxd2215xxx . the ic 50 for the effect of  xxxd2654xxx  on
kir6.2rsur1 channel current was consistent with that
found by the w3 hxglibenclamide displacement assay of
 xxxd2654xxx  to human  xxxg19xxx . these results demonstrate that
 xxxd2654xxx  inhibits human pancreatic b-cell type k atp
channels specifically by binding to  xxxg19xxx .
the tissue selectivity of some anti-diabetic drugs has
been demonstrated by gribble et al. ž1998.: ži.  xxxd3394xxx 
inhibits kir6.2rsur1 channels but not kir6.2rsur2a
channels; žii.  xxxd2215xxx  blocks both kir6.2rsur1
ž k i s 4 nm. and kir6.2rsur2b ž k i s 27 nm. channels;
and žiii. meglitinide, a non-sulfonylurea hypoglycemic
agent with a benzamide moiety, inhibits kir6.2rsur1 and
kir6.2rsur2a channels at similar concentrations ž k i s
0.3 and 0.5 mm, respectively..  xxxd2202xxx  also has high
selectivity to kir6.2rsur1 channels žlawrence et al.,
2001.. they propose that  xxxg19xxx  possesses binding sites for
both drugs ža sulfonylurea binding site and a benzamide
binding site., while sur2a has only a benzamide binding
site. they suggest that  xxxd3394xxx  and  xxxd2202xxx  bind to
the sulfonylurea binding site while  xxxd2215xxx  binds to
both sites, and that meglitinide binds only to the benzamide binding site, which implies that  xxxd2215xxx  and
meglitinide both bind to  xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg20xxx  and that  xxxd3394xxx  binds only to  xxxg19xxx . recently, reimann et al.
ž2001. reported that 100 nm  xxxd2654xxx  blocked only
kir6.2rsur1 channels, while 10 mm inhibited the
kir6.2rsur1, kir6.2rsur2a, and kir6.2rsur2b channels in xenopus oocytes. they suggest that  xxxg19xxx  has a

124

y. sunaga et al.r european journal of pharmacology 431 (2001) 119–125

high affinity site and  xxxg1250xxx  a low affinity site for  xxxd2654xxx . however, in the present study, we observed
that 10 mm of  xxxd2654xxx  does not inhibit either the
kir6.2rsur2a or kir6.2rsur2b channels in cos-1
cells. the discrepancy between the two studies is not clear,
but is probably due at least in part to the different expression systems used. on the other hand,  xxxd2702xxx  inhibits
all the kir6.2rsur1, kir6.2rsur2a, and kir6.2rsur2b
channels. another meglitinide-related compound,  xxxd3098xxx , already has been shown to inhibit all the kir6.2rsur1,
kir6.2rsur2a, and kir6.2rsur2b channels ždabrowski
et al., 2001.. high tissue selectivity of  xxxd2654xxx  also has
been found in native k atp channels žmogami et al., 1994.,
so  xxxd2654xxx  resembles  xxxd3394xxx  in terms of tissue
selectivity. in addition,  xxxd2654xxx  inhibits the binding of
w3 hxglibenclamide to  xxxg19xxx . these results suggest that
 xxxd2654xxx  binds to the sulfonylurea binding site in  xxxg19xxx 
but not to the benzamide binding site in sur2a.
the k atp channels in heart have been associated with
the cardioprotective mechanism of ischemia-related preconditioning žcole et al., 1991; terzic et al., 1995.. furthermore, recovery of cardiac contractility after ischemia
and reperfusion is significantly suppressed in the presence
of  xxxd2215xxx  žshigematsu et al., 1995.. it has been
shown recently that although high concentrations ž300 mm
and 1 mm. of  xxxd2654xxx  only slightly inhibit the k atp
channels in cardiovascular tissues,  xxxd2654xxx  at 3 mm
does not inhibit the channels žhu et al., 1999., consistent
with the present study. these findings suggest that  xxxd2654xxx  may not impair cardiac function after myocardial
damage and that the drug may be useful clinically. higher
selectivity for the k atp channels of the pancreatic b-cells
than those of cardiovascular tissues is a desirable feature
for antidiabetic agents to be used in treatment of type 2
diabetes.
sulfonylureas have been used in the treatment of type 2
diabetes mellitus for many years but several reports have
shown that chronic sulfonylurea treatment produces unresponsiveness to subsequent stimulation both in vitro and in
vivo žkaram et al., 1986; davalli et al., 1992; rabuazzo et
al., 1992.. in a previous study, we found that the insulin
secretion in response to  xxxd2215xxx  in min6 cells was
severely impaired after chronic exposure to 10 mm  xxxd2215xxx  žkawaki et al., 1999.. in the present study, we
used lower concentrations of  xxxd2215xxx  for chronic
treatment of min6 cells and found that insulin secretion in
acute response to  xxxd2654xxx ,  xxxd3394xxx , or  xxxd2215xxx , after chronic treatment with the respective drugs
was similarly retained to some extent. it has been reported
that glucose-induced insulin secretion from mice islets
treated with  xxxd2215xxx  or  xxxd3394xxx  was delayed
although there was no reduction in insulin secretion žanello
et al., 1999.. however, we find that glucose-induced insulin secretion is significantly suppressed in min6 cells
treated with  xxxd2654xxx ,  xxxd3098xxx ,  xxxd2702xxx ,  xxxd2215xxx  or  xxxd3394xxx  for 2 weeks. the discrepancy is

due probably to the different experimental conditions used,
including the different materials žmin6 vs. pancreatic
islets. and the different exposure periods ž2 weeks vs.
18–20 h..
in conclusion, we provide direct evidence that  xxxd2654xxx  binds to human  xxxg19xxx  and exhibits a high degree of
specificity for the pancreatic b-cell k atp channel. because
the effects of  xxxd2654xxx  on the pancreatic b-cell k atp
channel are reversible and the insulin secretory responses
to the various stimuli after chronic exposure to the drug
are similar to those of  xxxd3394xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx ,
 xxxd2654xxx  may be a clinically useful anti-diabetic drug in
the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
