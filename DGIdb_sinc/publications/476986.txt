summary

 xxxd435xxx  (cbz) is one of the major drugs currently used for the treatment of
graves’ disease. it is a carbethoxy derivative of  xxxd2594xxx  (mmi), originally
developed in the hope of obtaining a longer acting drug than  xxxd2594xxx . in the
present study we have demonstrated that  xxxd435xxx  is rapidly converted to  xxxd2594xxx  in vitro by serum from rats and humans, and we have obtained evidence
that this conversion is enzymatic. experiments with [3’s] cbz in rats showed that
the drug is so rapidly transformed to mmi after i.v. injection (within 3 min) that
very little of the unchanged drug would be expected to reach the thyroid gland.
the antithyroid action of cbz in rats, therefore, can be ascribed entirely to the
mmi to which it is rapidly converted. although no experiments were performed
with human subjects in vivo, the very rapid conversion of cbz to mmi by human
serum in vitro suggests that the antithyroid action of cbz in humans can also
be attributed to mmi. the original expectation of a longer acting drug has, therefore, not been met by cbz. on the basis of the studies reported here there appears
to be no advantage in using cbz in preference to mmi for the treatment of graves’
disease.
although the in vivo action of cbz must be attributed to its rapid conversion
to mmi, the drug does possess inherent antithyroid activity. this was shown in the
present study by the finding that cbz is as potent as mmi in blocking thyroid
peroxidase-catalysed iodination of thyroglobulin.

the antithyroid drugs most commonly used for the treatment of graves’ disease are 6-propyl
 xxxd3360xxx  (ptu), 1-methyl-2 mercaptoimidazole (mmi,  xxxd2594xxx ) and 1-methyl-3 carbethoxy- 2 mercaptoimidazole (cbz,  xxxd435xxx ). mmi and cbz are considerably more
potent than ptu in man, and they are administered in approximately one tenth the dose
used for ptu (solomon, 1978). the half-life of ptu in man is only 1-2 h (kampmann &
skovsted, 1974; mcmurry et al., 1975) and that of mmi somewhat longer (solomon, 1978).

no data are available for the half-life of cbz. all of the antithyroid drugs are generally
administered three times a day because of their short half-lives.
 xxxd435xxx  is a derivative of  xxxd2594xxx , and it was introduced by lawson et al.
(1951a, 1951b) with a view to obtaining a longer acting antithyroid drug. according t o their
report cbz is stable in neutral solution but is readily hydrolysed in acid or alkaline solution.
later studies by marchant et al. (1972) indicated that 1 h after injection of 35s-cbzinto
rats the only 35s-compound in an ultrafiltrate of plasma was mmi. thyroid 35swas examined
8 h after injection of 35s-cbz, and marchant et al. observed that the pattern of 3ss compounds determined by thin layer chromatography was practically identical to that seen after
injection of 35s-mmi. conversion of cbz t o mmi in human plasma in vitro was also briefly
mentioned (marchant e t al., 1972; stenlake et al., 1970), but no data were presented. as
stated by marchant et al. (1972) their observations support the view that the antithyroid
activity of cbz is due to the formation of mmi. their results raise the question whether
any useful purpose is achieved by the blocking group in cbz. the authors did not comment
on this implication from their studies.
we became interested in the question of cbz to mmi conversion when we observed that
cbz, like ptu and mmi, is a very potent inhibitor of  xxxg2320xxx -catalysed iodination
(taurog, 1976). in order t o determine whether this inhibitory activity could be attributed
to cbz itself it was necessary to rule out conversion of cbz t o mmi in the iodination test
system. in the present study we have employed spectral and labelling studies to demonstrate
that cbz is sufficiently stable in neutral solution to permit short-term in vitro experiments
and that it does possess inherent antithyroid activity. however, in an extension of the studies
of marchant et al. (1972) we observed that cbz is very rapidly (less than 3 min) converted
to mmi by plasma in vitro and in vivo, and we have obtained evidence that t h s conversion
in plasma is enzymatically mediated. our results lead us t o conclude that the antithyroid
action of cbz in graves’ disease patients and in laboratory animals can be entirely ascribed
to its rapid conversion t o mmi. the initial hope of finding a longer acting antithyroid drug
is not met by cbz.
m a t e r i a l s a n d methods

/35s/cbz and /35s/mmi. these were purchased from amersham corporation. the
specific activities were 103 mci/mm for cbz and 115 mci/mmol for mmi. the isotopic
purity of each compound, determined by filter paper chromatography, was estimated to be
greater than 95%.
animals. holtzman sprague-dawley male rats were purchased from an animal dealer.
they were maintained on a standard laboratory rat diet.
chemicals and reagents. cbz was purchased from nicholas laboratories ltd, mmi from
k and k laboratories, crystalline bsa from icn pharmaceuticals, inc., and phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride (pmsf) from sigma chemical co. ptu was a gift from american cyanamide. hog  xxxg2320xxx  (tpo) and human goitre thyroglobulin were prepared in this
laboratory as previously described (taurog & nakashima, 1978).
incubation system for studying the effect of thioureylene drugs on tpo-catalysedreactions.
the inhibitory effects of cbz, mmi and ptu were determined on tpo-catalysed iodination
of goitre thyroglobulin and on tpo-catalysed guaiacol oxidation.
the incubation system for iodination contained 1 pg/ml tpo, 2 mg/ml goitre thyroglobulin, 100 pmol [ i 3 l i ] iodide, 100 pmol hzoz, and varying concentrations of drug, in a

total volume of 1.0 ml of 0.06 m phosphate buffer, ph 7.0. the reaction was initiated at
25°c with the h z 0 2 and was stopped after 60 s by rapid addition of mmi (final concentration, 2.5 mm) and cooling in an ice bath. a small portion of the incubation mixture (25 pl)
was subjected t o paper chromatography for 1 h in collidine-3n nh4 oh, and the amount of
iodine bound to protein was determined, as previously described (taurog, 1976). bound
iodine varied from about 27 nmol/ml/min in the control samples (no drug) to zero in samples
containing the highest drug concentrations.
guaiacol oxidation was measured directly in a cuvette on a double beam spectrophotometer (hitachi model 124). the sample cell contained 1 pg/ml tpo, 1 mm guaiacol, 0.5
mg/ml bsa, and 100 pm h202,in a total volume of 2.1 ml of 0.06 m phosphate, ph 7.0.
the solution in the reference cell was identical in composition and in total volume, except
that buffer was substituted for h,02 the reaction was initiated in the sample cuvette by
the addition of h202, and the increase ip a470in 30 s was determined from the chart recording. values for aa470varied from about 0.32 in the control samples to zero in samples
containing the higher concentrations of drug.
conversion of cbz to mmiby senim in vitro. these studies included both isotopic labelling
and spectral procedures.
the labelling studies were performed with the 35s-labelled drugs. a solution of 35s-cbz
(1 mm) was first prepared in 0.067 m phosphate, ph 7.0. under these conditions there was
only very slow conversion t o mmi (see below). a portion of this solution was diluted 40-50
fold with pooled rat serum (final cbz concentration 20-25 pm). at intervals varying from
30 s to 16.5 min, 200 p1 portions were mixed with 800 pl of ice cold ethanol on a vortex
mixer for 15 s. after centrifugation for 4 min at 3000 rpm the supernates were drawn off
and placed on ice. both [35s]cbz and [35s]mmi were quantitatively extracted by the
ethanol. the extracts (25 p1) were chromatographed for 4 h on filter paper in two different
solvents, butanol saturated with water, and the organic phase of a mixture of chloroformethanol-water (160 : 40 : 25). these solvents had previously been employed by marchant
et al. (1972) for separating mmi and cbz by thin layer chromatography. the filter paper
strips used for chromatography in the present study were prewashed with edta, as previously
described (taurog, 1976). the dried chromatograms were scanned in a packard 4 pi strip
scanner.
spectral studies were performed with a double beam spectrophotometer (hitachi model
124). a freshly prepared solution of cbz in phosphate buffer at ph 7.0-7.5 showed an
absorption peak at 291 nm, clearly distinguishable from the 250 nm absorption maximum
for mmi. conversion of cbz to mmi could therefore be followed by the appearance of
the 250 nm peak for mmi. at room temperature this reaction occurred rather slowly,
approximately 10%of the cbz being hydrolysed per day. thus, spontaneous conversion of
cbz t o mmi was negligible in experiments lasting an hour or less with freshly prepared
solutions of cbz. in parallel studies to those described above with the 35s-labelled drugs,
100 pm cbz was incubated either with pooled rat serum or with human serum at 37°c.
at intervals ranging from 3 to 10 min, 500 pl portions were extracted with 2 ml of cold
ethanol, as described above. the extract was placed in the sample cuvette of the double
beam spectrophotometer, and the absorption spectrum (340-200 nm) was recorded. the
reference cuvette contained an extract of the same serum prepared in exactly the same
manner, except that buffer had been added instead of cbz. the peaks at 296 nm and at
256 nm were identified as those for cbz and mmi, respectively.
conversion of cbz to mmi in viva [35s]cbz (approximately 1 pmol) was injected via

the jugular vein into rats lightly anaesthetized with nembutal. blood was withdrawn from
the abdominal aorta with a heparinized syringe after about 3 min and immediately expelled
into a chilled tube in an ice bath. a sample (0.5 ml) was quickly taken and mixed with an
equal volume of pmsf in 50% ethanol on a vortex mixer. aliquots of the mixture were
analysed by paper chromatography in water-saturated butanol, as described above.

fig. 1a shows that cbz is as potent as mmi in inhibiting tpo-catalysed iodination of
goitre thyroglobulin. ptu is somewhat less potent. these results are very similar to those
reported previously (taurog, 1976). spectral measurements indicated that there was no
appreciable conversion of cbz to mmi under the conditions of the iodination experiments. the inhbitory effect of cbz in this in vitro system, therefore, cannot be ascribed
to mmi formation. it is an inherent property of cbz itself.
although no formation of mmi from cbz could be detected in the iodination system,
a rapid disappearance of absorbance at 296 nm was observed. this indicates that cbz
was oxidized by the peroxidase system, as described previously for mmi and ptu (taurog,
1976). from this and other evidence we conclude that the mechanism of inhibition by
cbz in the in vitro system is similar t o that proposed previously for mmi and ptu (taurog,
1976).

fig. 1b shows the inhibitory effects of cbz, mmi and ptu on tpo-catalysed oxidation
of guaiacol. in this reaction cbz was much less potent than mmi, in contrast to the results
obtained with the iodination system. similar findings were reported previously (taurog,
1976). we have also observed differing inhibitory potencies toward tpo-catalysed iodination
and tpo-catalysed guaicol oxidation with other drugs (taurog, 1970; taurog & dorris,
1971). these results have led to the suggestion that tpo-catalysed iodination of protein
and tpo-catalysed oxidation of guaicol are not mediated by identical active sites on thyroid
peroxidase (taurog & dorris, 197 1).

the rate of conversion of cbz to mmi in serum, compared to the very slow conversion

enzymatic. evidence for this is presented in the following four sections.

it is clear from these results that the serum factor responsible for the conversion of cbz
to mmi was almost completely inactivated at a temperature of 60-70°c.

effect of phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride (pmsf). this agent is known to inhibit
serum proteases and esterases (fahrney & gold, 1963). since it seemed likely that esterase
activity was involved in the serum conversion of cbz to mmi, it was of interest to determine
the effect of pmsf on the reaction. as shown in fig. 7 1 mm pmsf exerted a definite
inhibitory effect on the conversion of cbz to mmi by serum. no inhibitory effect was
observed with 2 mm edta.
conversion of cbz to mmi in vivo. marchant et al. reported previously (1972) that 1 h
after injection of [35s]cbz into rats only [35s]mmi could be detected in an uitrafiltrate
of plasma. it seemed from our in vifro results, described above, that conversion of cbz to
mmi in vivo should occur withn a few minutes. this is demonstrated in the results shown
in fig. 8. it can be seen that within 3-3.5 min after i.v. injection of [35s]cbz into rats
practically all the 35sin the circulation was in the form of mmi. these findings demonstrate

that cbz is so rapidly transformed to mmi upon injection into rats that very little, if any,
of the injected drug could survive sufficiently long t o reach the thyroid gland. we conclude
from these results that injection of cbz is tantamount to the injection of an equivalent
dose of mmi.
discussion
cbz is one of the major antithyroid drugs currently used for the treatment of graves’
disease. it is a derivative of mmi containing a carbethoxy blocking group, and it was developed
in the hope of prolonging the half-life of mmi. it was originally proposed (lawson e t al.,
195 la) that the carbethoxy blocking group is attached to the sulphur atom which is linked
to the imidazole ring, but later studies (lawson & morley, 1956) indicated that it was more
likely bound to one of the ring nitrogen atoms. if the carbethoxy group is bound to n rather
than to s, then cbz contains an unsubstituted thiocarbonyl group, and o n the basis of
studies previously reported from this laboratory (taurog, 1976) it would be expected to
inhibit tpo-catalysed reactions in vitro. the results in fig. 1 demonstrate that cbz, like
ptu and mmi, is indeed a potent inhibitor of tpo-catalysed iodination and guaiacol oxidation, results very similar to those that we have reported previously (taurog, 1976). it was
further shown in the present study that this inhibitory action of cbz does not involve prior
conversion to mmi.  xxxd435xxx  itself possesses inherent antithyroid potency.
cbz is only slowly converted to mmi in aqueous buffer at neutral ph, and a similar slow
conversion in vivo was assumed when cbz was first introduced for the treatment of thyro-

toxicosis. however, the rate of conversion of cbz to mmi in rat or human serum is very
rapid. experiments in the present study demonstrated complete conversion in 3 min at 37°c
even when the concentration of cbz was as high as 100 pm. these findings suggested that
the reaction in serum is enzymatic. several lines of evidence were obtained in support of
this view: (1) the serum factor responsible for conversion of cbz to mmi was completely
inactivated at 6o-7o0c, (2) the reaction rate in serum at 0°c was greatly reduced, (3) the
reaction was significantly inhibited by the esterase inhibitor, pmsf, and (4) the serum
activity was not diminished by extensive dialysis.
the present studies provide strong evidence that the conversion of cbz to mmi by serum
is enzymatically mediated. however, further studies are required to define the enzymatic
mechanism more precisely. the inhibitory effect of pmsf suggests that a serum esterase is
involved, but as shown in fig. 7 this agent was only partially inhibitory. t h s could mean

conversion of  xxxd435xxx  to  xxxd2594xxx 

647

that only a part of serum activity can be ascribed t o apmsf-sensitiveenzyme or, alternatively,
that pmsf in serum is not as potent an esterase inhibitor as it is in more purified systems.
assuming that a pmsf-sensitive esterase is responsible for the conversion of cbz to mmi
in serum, the problem still remains that splitting of the ester bond in cbz does not alone
result in mmi formation. a second decarboxylation step would also be necessary. in this
connection the reaction described by ravin et al. (1951) for the determination of serum
cholinesterase is of interest. this reaction employs 0-carbonaphthoxycholine as substrate
and is believed to occur in two steps. the first step, which is enzymatic, yields the product
pnapthyl carbonic acid. the latter is unstable and is believed to decarboxylate spontaneously
and immediately t o &naphthol. using this reaction as a model and assuming on the basis of
the results with pmsf that a serum esterase is involved in the conversion of cbz to mmi,
the following two step mechanism may be proposed:

further studies are required to determine the validity of this scheme.
the in vitro studies with cbz in serum indicated that conversion of cbz t o mmi should
also occur rapidly in vivo. this was demonstrated in experiments with the labelled drug.
[35s]cbz was injected i.v. into rats and blood was taken from the abdominal aorta approximately 3 min later. the blood was immediately chilled and quickly mixed with an equal
volume of 5 mm pmsf in 50% ethanol to stop further enzymatic conversion of cbz to mmi.
chromatography of the mixture revealed only a single peak for 35s, corresponding t o mmi
(fig. 8). these findings demonstrate that cbz is so rapidly transformed to mmi in rats that
the drug itself could hardly be expected to exert appreciable antithyroid activity. its antithyroid action in vivo must be attributed t o the mmi to which it is so rapidly converted.
these findings confirm and extend the previous report of marchant et al. (1972).
since human serum is also very active in converting cbz t o mmi, it seems most likely

648

toshiro nakashima and alvin taurog

that, in humans also, the antithyroid activity of cbz depends entirely on its conversion
to mmi. these observations question the validity of the initial assumption that cbz is a
longer acting drug than mmi. our data indicate that there can be no significant difference
between the duration of action of the drugs, since administration of cbz is essentially
equivalent to administration of mmi. since cbz is presumably made from mmi the question
arises whether it would be more economical to use mmi in preference to cbz. a minor
advantage of cbz could be in its taste. it was stated by lawson et ul. t o be tasteless, whereas
mmi was said to have a bitter taste (195 la).
