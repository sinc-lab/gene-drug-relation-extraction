 xxxd138xxx  is an endothelin type a (eta)–selective
receptor antagonist that is metabolized primarily by glucuronidation but also undergoes oxidative metabolism by
cyp3a4. the potential for ketoconazole, the archetypal
strong inhibitor of cyp3a4, to alter the pharmacokinetic
profile of  xxxd138xxx  and its oxidative metabolite,
4-hydroxymethyl  xxxd138xxx , was assessed in an openlabel, nonrandomized, 2-period, single-sequence study
in 16 healthy men. participants received a single dose of
 xxxd138xxx  10 mg alone and after 4 days of ketoconazole 400 mg administered once daily. in the presence of
multiple doses of ketoconazole, single-dose  xxxd138xxx 
auc0-∞ estimate was increased by 35.3%, whereas cmax was
increased by 20.0%. for the 4‑hydroxymethyl  xxxd138xxx 

metabolite, auc0-∞ estimate was decreased by 4.0%,
whereas cmax was decreased by 16.5%. concomitant
administration of  xxxd138xxx  and ketoconazole was well
tolerated. in summary, ketoconazole had no clinically
significant effect on the pharmacokinetics or safety profile of  xxxd138xxx ; therefore, no changes in  xxxd138xxx 
dose should be necessary when the drug is administered
concomitantly with known cyp3a4 inhibitors.

a

also undergoes oxidative metabolism, primarily by
 xxxg590xxx  (cyp3a4) and, to a lesser
extent, by  xxxg592xxx  and cyp2c19. the principal oxidative metabolite of  xxxd138xxx  is 4-hydroxymethyl
 xxxd138xxx . the auc of this metabolite following
single or repeat oral doses is approximately 4% of
parent  xxxd138xxx  in plasma, which indicates that
it is a minor metabolite. furthermore, the binding
affinity of 4-hydroxymethyl  xxxd138xxx  for the
human  xxxg676xxx  is 100-fold less than  xxxd138xxx . on this basis, 4-hydroxymethyl  xxxd138xxx  is
not considered to contribute appreciably to the pharmacologic effect in humans.
patients treated with  xxxd138xxx  may potentially
also receive treatment with compounds that are strong
cyp3a4 inhibitors (eg, erythromycin, amiodarone,
grapefruit juice). in addition, many protease inhibitors used for the treatment of hiv, a known cause of
pah, are strong inhibitors of cyp3a4. because
 xxxd138xxx  undergoes oxidative metabolism via
cyp3a4, it was important to determine whether inhibition of this metabolic pathway would result in a
clinically significant increase in  xxxd138xxx  exposure. this study assessed the effects of ketoconazole,

mbrisentan is a high-affinity,  xxxd3029xxx –
based endothelin type a (eta)–selective receptor antagonist recently approved for the treatment
of pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah). in clinical studies,  xxxd138xxx , administered at dosages
of 5 and 10 mg once daily, improved exercise capacity, delayed clinical worsening, and improved symptoms in patients with pah.1
 xxxd138xxx  is metabolized primarily by hepatic
glucuronidation and, to a lesser extent, by oxidative
metabolism.  xxxd138xxx  is glucuronidated by
several uridine glucuronosyltransferases, including
 xxxg2385xxx , ugt1a3s, and ugt2b7s.  xxxd138xxx

the archetypal strong inhibitor of cyp3a4, on the
pharmacokinetic (pk) profiles of  xxxd138xxx  and
4‑hydroxymethyl  xxxd138xxx .
methods
study population
individuals included in this study were men aged
18 to 55 years with a body mass index between
18.5 and 29.9 kg/m2. participants were considered
to be in good health by the investigator on the basis
of medical history; physical examination, including vital sign assessment; 12-lead electrocardiogram; and routine laboratory testing (hematology,
blood chemistry, and urinalysis). participants were
screened within 21 days of enrollment, and written
informed consent was obtained. participants who
had smoked or used tobacco products in the past
12 months were excluded. participants were tested
for drugs of abuse and alcohol at screening and on
admission to the unit. if participants had tested
positive, they would have been excluded. participants
were not allowed to consume substances known to
interfere with cytochrome p450 enzymes within
72 hours prior to dosing and throughout the study.
study design
this was an open-label, nonrandomized, 2-period,
single-sequence study. in each period, participants
were confined to the clinical facility from at least 12
hours prior to drug administration until completion
of pk assessments. all doses of  xxxd138xxx  and ketoconazole were administered after a standard breakfast (approximately 600 calories, 25%-30% coming
from fat, composed of bread, cereal, juice, and 2%
milk; no grapefruit, grapefruit juice, or caffeine was
provided). in period 1, participants received a single
dose of  xxxd138xxx  10 mg (gilead sciences, inc,
broomfield, colorado). a washout period of 4 days
separated  xxxd138xxx  administration in periods 1
and 2. in period 2, participants were administered
ketoconazole 400 mg (two 200-mg tablets; teva, inc,
north wales, pennsylvania) once daily on days 1
through 4. participants then received ketoconazole
400 mg and  xxxd138xxx  10 mg concurrently on day
5, followed by 2 additional doses of ketoconazole
400 mg on days 6 and 7.
the plasma pk profiles of  xxxd138xxx  and
4-hydroxymethyl  xxxd138xxx  were assessed at
scheduled intervals for 72 hours after  xxxd138xxx 

720  •  j clin pharmacol 2009;49:719-724

dosing on day 1 of period 1 ( xxxd138xxx  alone) and
day 5 of period 2 ( xxxd138xxx  coadministered with
ketoconazole).
safety assessments included vital signs measurements, 12-lead electrocardiograms, routine laboratory
testing, and adverse event monitoring. a follow-up
visit was conducted approximately 7 days following
the last dose of study medication. the study was
conducted at seaview research (miami, florida) following approval by the independent investigational
review board (plantation, florida).
pharmacokinetic assessments
plasma concentrations of  xxxd138xxx  and 4hydroxymethylmethyl  xxxd138xxx  were determined from blood samples taken during each
treatment period on days 1 and 5 at predose and at
prespecified intervals postdose (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3,
4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours). blood
samples were collected in tubes containing k3-edta,
immediately mixed by gentle inversion to prevent
coagulation, and then placed on ice prior to centrifugation. within 30 minutes of collection, samples
were centrifuged at 1500 g for 15 minutes at 4°c to
separate plasma from cells. plasma samples were
stored at –20°c until analysis.
plasma concentrations of  xxxd138xxx  and 4hydroxymethyl  xxxd138xxx  were measured by a
validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass
spectrometry (lc/ms/ms) method at admequant
(formerly adc corp, colorado springs, colorado).
the method incorporated an internal standard,
and each sample analysis batch included calibration standards and quality control (qc) samples.
the plasma assay involves addition of an internal
standard (bsf 127041, 2-(4,6-dimethoxy-pyrimidin2-yloxy)-3-phenoxy-3-phenyl-butyric acid), extraction of the analytes by liquid-liquid partition with
acidified organic solvent, evaporation of the organic
phase, reconstitution in organic solvent, and injection on the lc/ms/ms system (pe sciex api 4000
qtrap, concord, ontario, canada) using a c18 highperformance liquid chromatography (hplc) column.
quantitation was by positive ionization mode, and
transition masses for  xxxd138xxx  were 379.2 and
125.2 as well as 395.2 and 319.3 for 4-hydroxymethyl  xxxd138xxx . the calibration curve range was
1 to 400 ng/ml for  xxxd138xxx  and 0.2 to 100 ng/
ml for 4-hydroxymethyl  xxxd138xxx  using 0.1 ml
of the plasma sample aliquot. the precision of the
 xxxd138xxx  assay was ≤15%, as indicated by the

effect of ketoconazole on  xxxd138xxx 
percent coefficient of variation (%cv), and the accuracy of the assay was within ±15% of the actual value
for  xxxd138xxx  and its metabolite. the lower limits
of quantitation for  xxxd138xxx  and 4-hydroxymethyl
 xxxd138xxx  were both 0.5 ng/ml.
the pk analyses were performed using winnonlin
pro version 4.0.1 (pharsight corp, palo alto, california)
software; noncompartmental methods were used.
plasma pk parameters included area under the
­concentration-time curve (auc) from time 0 to infinity (auc0-∞) or last measurement (auc0-last), maximum
plasma concentration (cmax), and time to maximum
concentration (tmax).
statistical analysis
using loge-transformed cmax, auc0-last, and auc0-∞
values, individual paired differences were calculated
for  xxxd138xxx  administered with ketoconazole versus  xxxd138xxx  administered alone. geometric mean
ratios (gmrs) and 90% confidence intervals (cis)
were calculated based on the arithmetic mean and
sample summary statistics of these paired differences. given the available information, some increase
in exposure to  xxxd138xxx  in the presence of ketoconazole was anticipated. in this study, the prespecified boundaries for the 90% cis were set at 70% to
143%. these boundaries are commonly applied
when a test drug has a relatively wide therapeutic
index2-4 and were considered appropriate based on
the broad therapeutic index of  xxxd138xxx  for both
safety and efficacy.1 drugs with a significant contribution from cyp3a4 to their metabolism are generally subject to substantial increases in exposure in
the presence of ketoconazole (usually >2-fold).5-8
with a sample size of 12 evaluable participants, the
analysis had a 96% power to reject the 2 null hypotheses that the ratio of test mean to the standard mean
was below 70% and above 143%, assuming that the
true ratio was not larger than 105% and the square
root of the mean square error was not larger than 0.2,
respectively.

sixteen male participants enrolled and completed
the study. the participants had a mean (sd) age of
48.6 (3.38) years and mean (sd) height, weight, and

pharmacokinetic results
 xxxd138xxx 
 xxxd138xxx  plasma concentrations were slightly
higher in the presence of ketoconazole over the
72-hour sampling period compared with  xxxd138xxx 
administered alone (figure 1). the median time to
peak  xxxd138xxx  concentrations (tmax) was unchanged
in the presence of ketoconazole. the auc0-∞ was
well characterized; therefore, only this auc value is

the median time to peak 4-hydroxymethyl
 xxxd138xxx  concentrations (tmax) was similar when

after coadministration of  xxxd138xxx  with ketoconazole. all reported adverse events were assessed as
mild in severity.
there were no clinically significant changes in
clinical laboratory and electrocardiographic parameters or vital sign measurements when  xxxd138xxx 
and ketoconazole were given concomitantly.
discussion
•

ketoconazole is a strong inhibitor of both the
cyp3a4 metabolic pathway and the p-gp transporter. drugs that are primarily metabolized by
cyp3a4 may be subject to clinically important
increases in exposure when coadministered with
ketoconazole. inhibition of cyp3a4 is time dependent; ketoconazole reaches pharmacokinetic steady
state after 3 days, and in clinical studies, the maximum effect on cyp3a4 activity has been observed
after 4 days.2 therefore, ketoconazole was administered for 4 days prior to concomitant administration
with  xxxd138xxx  in this study.

•

examples of drugs that have substantial increases in
exposure during coadministration with ketoconazole include midazolam (increased 5- to 16-fold),5-7
simvastatin (increased 12.5-fold),5 and  xxxd358xxx 
(increased 2.3-fold).8

safety and tolerability
the concomitant administration of  xxxd138xxx  and
ketoconazole was generally well tolerated, and no
serious adverse events were reported. in addition, no
adverse events were reported that led to discontinuation from the study. four participants experienced
1 adverse event each (constipation, toothache, headache, cough) after receiving a single dose of  xxxd138xxx . one participant reported a tension headache
drug interactions

in this study conducted in healthy volunteers, multiple doses of ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 4 days)
resulted in a 20% and 35% increase in  xxxd138xxx 
723

richards et al
cmax and auc0-∞, respectively. the mean t1/2 of
 xxxd138xxx  was slightly prolonged in the presence
of ketoconazole, indicating a small effect on systemic clearance of  xxxd138xxx . exposures of the
4-hydroxymethyl metabolite of  xxxd138xxx  were
decreased in the presence of ketoconazole with cmax
and auc0-∞ decreasing by 16.5% and 4.0%, respectively. this modest increase in  xxxd138xxx  exposure is consistent with cyp3a4 being a minor
pathway in  xxxd138xxx  metabolism. furthermore,
the increases observed in mean auc and cmax for
 xxxd138xxx  were similar to the intersubject variability observed for these parameters and thus are
not considered to be clinically relevant.
in summary, ketoconazole had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics or safety
profile of  xxxd138xxx ; therefore, no changes in
 xxxd138xxx  dosages should be necessary when the
drug is administered concomitantly with known
cyp3a4 inhibitors.
