hiv-associated nephropathy is characterized by renal podocyte proliferation and dedifferentiation. this study found that
all- xxxd3417xxx  (atra) reverses the effects of hiv-1 infection in podocytes. treatment with atra reduced cell
proliferation rate by causing g1 arrest and restored the expression of the differentiation markers (synaptopodin, nephrin,
podocin, and wt-1) in hiv-1–infected podocytes. it is interesting that both atra and  xxxd114xxx   xxxd3417xxx  increased intracellular camp
levels in podocytes. podocytes expressed most isoforms of  xxxd3417xxx  receptors (rar) and retinoid x receptors (rxr) with
the exception of rxr␥. rar␣ antagonists blocked atra-induced camp production and its antiproliferative and prodifferentiation effects on podocytes, suggesting that rar␣ is required. for determination of the effect of increased intracellular
camp on hiv-infected podocytes, cells were stimulated with either  xxxd1742xxx  or 8-bromo-camp. both compounds inhibited
cell proliferation significantly and restored synaptopodin expression in hiv-infected podocytes. the effects of atra were
abolished by rp-camp, an inhibitor of the camp/ xxxg1836xxx  pathway and were enhanced by  xxxd3142xxx , an inhibitor of
 xxxg1697xxx , suggesting that the antiproliferative and prodifferentiation effects of atra on hiv-infected podocytes
are camp dependent. furthermore, both atra and  xxxd1742xxx  suppressed hiv-induced  xxxg1366xxx  and
2 and stat3 phosphorylation. in vivo, atra reduced proteinuria, cell proliferation, and glomerulosclerosis in hiv-1–transgenic
mice. these findings suggest that atra reverses the abnormal phenotype in hiv-1–infected podocytes by stimulating
rar␣-mediated intracellular camp production. these results demonstrate the mechanism by which atra reverses the
proliferation of podocytes that is induced by hiv-1.

iv-associated nephropathy (hivan) is the most
common cause of chronic renal failure in hiv-1–
seropositive patients (1). the key histologic features
of hivan are collapsing fsgs and microcystic tubular dilation
(2). a unique characteristic of hivan is that podocytes, which
normally are quiescent and highly differentiated cells, undergo
marked proliferation and dedifferentiation (3,4). expression of
hiv-1 viral proteins is critical for pathogenesis as shown in
hiv-1–transgenic mice (tg26) as well as humans (5,6). podocytes from hiv-1–transgenic mice exhibit increased growth rate
and loss of contact inhibition when compared with those of
control littermates (7). in vitro, infection of podocytes with
hiv-1 also causes proliferation and dedifferentiation (8). we
have shown that the hiv-1 nef gene is the major determinant of
podocyte proliferation and dedifferentiation (8,9) by inducing

src-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) 1 and
2/stat3 activation (10).
retinoids are derivatives of  xxxd3105xxx  and have multiple
cellular functions, including inhibition of proliferation, induction of cell differentiation, regulation of apoptosis, and inhibition of inflammation (11). during kidney development, retinoic
acid (ra) affects tubulogenesis and nephron number (12). in
addition to their established benefits in treating some malignancies, retinoids have been found to provide protection in
several experimental models of kidney disease (13–16). in rat
models of acute and chronic mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, retinoids preserve renal function, decrease albuminuria, and reduce glomerular and tubular damage (13,14). in the
rat model of  xxxd3041xxx  aminonucleoside–induced nephrosis,
retinoids prevent proteinuria from developing by protecting
podocytes from injury (15,16).
retinoids exert their effects by binding two families of nuclear
receptors,  xxxd3417xxx  receptors (rar) and retinoid x receptors
(rxr). all-trans-ra (atra) binds and activates the rar (rar ␣,
␤, and ␥), whereas  xxxd114xxx   xxxd3417xxx  binds and activates both the rar and
the rxr (rxr ␣, ␤, and ␥) (17). rar are expressed in many
tissues, including the kidney (18). they affect gene transcription
either directly by binding to the ra-response elements of a proissn: 1046-6673/1801-0093

moter region (18,19) or indirectly by modulating transcription
factors such as activator-protein 1 (20,21) or nf-␬b (22). activation
of cytosolic signaling molecules by retinoids also has been reported as an important pathway to induce leukemia cell differentiation (23). retinoids directly alter the activity of various protein
kinases, including mapk and protein kinase c isoforms (24,25). a
recent study reported that atra induced rapid camp production
and increases  xxxg1836xxx  (pka) activity in acute myeloblastic leukemia cells, leading to cell differentiation (26). a synergistic
effect between atra and inhibitors of phosphodiesterase also was
observed for myeloid differentiation (27).
on the basis of the antiproliferative nature of atra and the patho-

j am soc nephrol 18: 93–102, 2007

genesis of hivan (podocyte proliferation and dedifferentiation), we
hypothesized that retinoids may exert a beneficial effect on podocytes
that are infected with hiv-1. in this study, we show that atra can
inhibit hiv-1–induced podocyte proliferation and dedifferentiation
through activation of an rar␣-mediated camp/pka pathway.

hiv-1– or mock-infected podocytes were plated on
collagen-coated plates and cultured for 14 d with or without
all- xxxd3417xxx  (atra). cell-cycle distribution was
analyzed as described in materials and methods. the g0/g1,

determined. ap, hypodiploid dna content (apoptotic

the hiv-1 constructs were described previously (8). briefly, the hiv-1
gag/pol deleted construct pnl4 –3: xxxd1443xxx  was derived from the provirus
pnl4 –3. a fragment that contained the egfp gene (from pegfp-c1;
clontech, palo alto, ca) was inserted at the sphi/msci gag/pol deletion
site. the expression of hiv-1 genes was confirmed by western blot analysis. the hiv-1 gag/pol genes and vsv.g envelope glycoprotein were
provided in trans using pcmv r8.91 and pmd.g plasmids, respectively
(gifts of dr. didier trono, salk institute, la jolla, ca). as a negative
control, virus also was produced from phr-cmv-ires2-gfp-⌬b, which
contains the hiv-1 long-term repeat and egfp. as the pilot study, we
performed experiments in both freshly infected podocytes and a subset of

95

established podocytes. we obtained similar results; therefore, we used
here the established hiv-infected podocytes. in all experiments, cells were
grown at 37°c on type 1 collagen– coated dishes for 10 d to inactivate the
temperature-sensitive t antigen and to allow for differentiation. by western blot, we confirmed that t antigen was absent in these cells.

cell growth assay
control and hiv-1–infected podocytes were plated on collagencoated 24-well plates at a density of 20,000 cells/well. podocytes
were cultured further for 3 to 5 d with atra or  xxxd114xxx   xxxd3417xxx  (0.1 to 10
␮m; sigma, st. louis, mo), rar␣ agonists (am580 and ro-23-4217),
rar␣ antagonist, and rxr agonist ro-25-7386, and 4-hydroxyphenylretinamide, a poor activator of rar, which served as a negative
control (roche, basel, switzerland) (29). for testing of pka pathway
involvement, podocytes were cultured with  xxxd477xxx  (10 ␮m; calbiochem, san diego, ca),  xxxd3142xxx  (10 ␮m; calbiochem), rp-camp
(100␮m; sigma),  xxxd1742xxx  (sigma), or various combinations as indicated in the figures. vehicle alone served as a control. after
intervention, cells were trypsinized and counted. for studying contact inhibition, podocytes were cultured for 10 d under nonpermissive conditions and were plated at 80% confluence on collagencoated dishes. podocytes were cultured further with atra (10 ␮m)
or vehicle (dmso), and photographs were taken on day 7. 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2htetrazolium (mts) assay for cell proliferation also was performed after
3 d using a protocol that was provided by manufacturer (promega,
madison, wi).

flow cytometry
after virus infection, podocytes were cultured under nonpermissive
conditions for 10 d and then incubated with atra (10 ␮m) or vehicle for
4 additional days. cells were trypsinized, washed with 1⫻ pbs, and
fixed with ice-cold 80% ethanol. cells were pelleted, resuspended in 1⫻
pbs, and passed through a 25-g needle to create a single suspension.
rnase (1 mg/ml) and  xxxd3027xxx  iodine (400 ␮g/ml) were added, and

cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°c. cell-cycle analysis was performed on a facscalibur flow cytometer, and data were analyzed
with cellquest software (becton dickinson, mountain view, ca).

apoptosis study
apoptosis was determined by  xxxg166xxx  fitc apoptosis detection
kit (bd bioscience, san jose, ca). this combined staining using an-

nexin v and  xxxd3027xxx  iodide allowed us to distinguish early apoptotic cells from necrotic or later apoptotic cells. after staining, apoptotic
cells were measured by flow cytometry.

northern blot analysis
total rna was extracted using trizol (life technologies brl, grand
island, ny). probes were generated by reverse transcriptase–pcr of
rna that were isolated from glomeruli of a normal mouse. the cdna
probes were radiolabeled with [32p-␣] dctp by random oligonucleotide priming and hybridized either with hybrisol (intergen, purchase,
ny) or with ultrahyb (ambion, austin, tx).

real-time pcr
real-time pcr was performed with a roche lightcycler with a
qiagen quantitect one step rtpcr sybr green kit (qiagen, valencia,
ca) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. validated primer sets
for nephrin and tubulin were obtained from qiagen. melting-curve
analysis was performed to check for a single amplicon that was verified
by size using gel electrophoresis. lightcycler analysis software was
used for determining crossing points using the second derivative
method. data were analyzed by the 2⫺⌬⌬ ct method as described by
livak and schmittgen (30) and are presented as fold increase normalized to housekeeping genes.

assay for camp
intracellular camp was measured using a camp biotrak enzyme
immunoassay system (amersham biosciences, piscataway, nj). after
being serum-starved overnight, cells were stimulated with different
analogs of retinoids (0.1 to 10 ␮m) with or without  xxxd3142xxx  (10 ␮m) for
2, 5, 10, and 30 min as indicated. cells were lysed, and 100 ␮l of cell
lysates was used for the assay. a nonacetylation enzyme immunoassay
procedure was used to measured intracellular camp production with a
standard curve in a range from 12.5 to 3200 fmol/well.

western blot
podocytes were lysed with a buffer that contained 1% np40, a protease
inhibitor cocktail and tyrosine and serine-threonine phosphorylation inhibitors. cell lysates were subjected to western blot analysis using the
following specific antibodies: anti–phospho- xxxg1366xxx ,2, anti- xxxg1366xxx ,2, anti–phospho-stat3, and anti-stat3 from cell signaling laboratory (beverly,
ma). anti-nef antibody was obtained from fit biotech oyj plc (tampere,
finland). anti-podocin antibody was a gift from dr. peter mundel (mount
sinai school of medicine, ny).

degree of interstitial disease, mostly tubular dilation, was recorded as
an overall impression of the biopsy with the same percentage range.
immunohistochemical analysis for nuclear cell proliferation–associated antigen (ki67) to assess proliferation was performed with mouse
anti-ki67 1:100 (bd pharmingen, san diego, ca) and followed by
biotinylated horse anti-mouse igg antibodies (1:100; both from vector
laboratories, burlingame, ca). the abc elite kit was used to enhance
the signal, and staining was visualized by reaction with 3,3⬘-diaminobenzidine. the number of ki67-positive nuclei per glomerulus was
scored in a total of 50 glomeruli per mouse.

statistical analyses
for the cell proliferation and camp assays, the data are means ⫾ sd
of the mean. for northern blot and western blot analysis, all experiments were repeated at least three times. representative experiments
are shown below. statistically significant differences between the
means were determined by unpaired t test or the mann-whitney u test
where appropriate. significance was defined as a p ⱕ 0.05.

results
ra inhibits proliferation and restores differentiation
markers in hiv-1–infected podocytes

we found that atra (10 ␮m) markedly decreased cell proliferation rate in both control and hiv-1–infected podocytes (figure
1a). there was no nuclear fragmentation in the cells that were
treated with up to 10 ␮m atra, suggesting that cell toxicity or
increased apoptosis was not responsible for these findings. this
was confirmed further by analysis of apoptosis cells using  xxxg166xxx  and  xxxd3027xxx  iodide staining. the antiproliferative effects of atra were reversible because hiv-infected podocytes
recovered a high growth rate when atra was removed from
culture medium (data not shown). atra (10 ␮m) also inhibited the
contact-independent growth of podocytes that was induced by
hiv-1 infection (figure 1b). podocytes that were treated with
atra were enlarged and grew in a monolayer, suggesting that
these cells had converted back to a more differentiated state. for
further exploration of the effective dosage of atra on podocyte
proliferation, both control and hiv-infected podocytes were incu-

bated with atra at different concentrations. we found that atra
significantly inhibited hiv-induced proliferation at 0.5 ␮m (figure 1c).
facs analysis was performed on hiv-1– and mock-infected
podocytes that were treated with atra for 7 d. as shown in
table 1, the percentage of hiv-1–infected podocytes in the
g0/g1 phase was one third that of mock-infected podocytes
(22.1 versus 61%). treatment of hiv-1–infected podocytes with
atra resulted in an increase in the percentage of cells in g1 to
53.6% with a decrease in the fraction of cells in the s phase.
these results demonstrate that atra inhibits the proliferation
of hiv-1–infected podocytes by inducing g1 arrest.
ra has been shown to inhibit g1-to-s transition by regulating
the expression of cell-cycle proteins (31,32). we found that atra
inhibited the transcription of  xxxg365xxx  and cyclin e in hiv-1–
infected podocytes (figure 1d). these findings suggest that
atra blocks hiv-1–induced g13 s progression through downregulation of  xxxg365xxx  and cyclin e expression.
because hiv-1 infection also is known to suppress expression of podocyte differentiation markers, we examined whether
atra could reverse these effects as well. hiv-1–infected podocytes were treated with atra (10 ␮m) or vehicle for 3 d. as
shown by northern blot, atra significantly increased the
mrna levels of wt-1 and synaptopodin in hiv-infected podocytes (figure 1d). the effect of atra and  xxxd114xxx   xxxd3417xxx  on synaptopodin expression was dosage dependent, as shown in figure

1e. by real-time pcr, we found that nephrin mrna levels also
increased after atra treatment in both control and hiv-infected podocytes (figure 1e). similarly, western blot analysis
showed that atra stimulated podocin expression in both control and hiv-infected podocytes (figure 1f). these data suggest that treatment with atra induces podocyte differentiation.

ra induces a rapid increase in intracellular camp in
podocytes through rar␣
recently, it was shown that atra stimulates intracellular
camp generation in leukemia cells, suggesting a critical cytosolic pathway for myeloid differentiation (26). because activation of the camp pathway generally is considered protective of
injury in podocytes (33), we examined whether camp mediates
the effects of atra on podocytes. we found that atra induced
a three- to four-fold increase in intracellular camp production
in control podocytes. this stimulation was amplified when cells
were pretreated with  xxxd3142xxx , a  xxxg1697xxx  (pde4)
inhibitor (figure 2a). a similar pattern of stimulation was
observed in hiv-1–infected podocytes (figure 2b). once again,
stimulation of camp production by atra and  xxxd114xxx   xxxd3417xxx  were
dosage dependent (figure 2, c and d).
next, we investigated whether podocytes have retinoid receptors and whether these receptors mediate the actions of
atra on hiv-infected podocytes. by northern blot, we found
that podocytes express rar␣, rar␤, rar␥, rxr␣, and rxr␤

j am soc nephrol 18: 93–102, 2007

ra inhibits hiv-1–induced podocyte proliferation through camp

(figure 3a). we also found that hiv infection significantly
suppressed expression of two major receptors in podocytes
(rar␣ and rxr␣; figure 3a). using receptor-specific agonists
and antagonists, we evaluated the roles of these receptors in
mediating the effects of ra on podocytes. the rar␣ antagonist
(ro-41-5253) blocked atra-induced camp production (figure
3b). conversely, the rxr agonist (ro-25-7386) had only a minor
effect on atra-induced camp production (figure 3c). these
data suggest that rar␣ but not rxr mediates atra-induced
camp production. the mechanism by which this occurs remains to be determined. we examined whether rar␣ also
mediates the phenotypic effects of atra on podocytes. as
shown in figure 3d, rar␣ agonists (am580 and ro-23-4217)
but not rxr agonist (ro-25-7386) significantly inhibited hivinduced proliferation, similar to atra and  xxxd3417xxx . furthermore, the rar␣ antagonist ro-41-5253 blocked the inhibitory
effects of atra. the rar␣ agonists also restored expression of
synaptopodin in hiv-infected podocytes similar to what was
observed with atra, and the rar␣ antagonist blocked the
effect of atra on synaptopodin expression (figure 3e). therefore, although the expression is suppressed partially in hivinfected podocytes, rar␣ still plays a critical role in mediating
the effects of retinoids on podocytes.

dent manner (figure 6a).  xxxd1742xxx  and 8-bromo-camp also
inhibited hiv-induced  xxxg1366xxx ,2 phosphorylation (figure 6b),
whereas rp-camp abolished the inhibitory effect of atra on
 xxxg1366xxx ,2 activation (figure 6c). together, these data indicate
that atra inhibits  xxxg1366xxx ,2 phosphorylation through activation of the camp pathway. we also found that both atra and
 xxxd3417xxx  suppressed phosphorylation of stat3 (tyr705; figure
6d). as a control, we did not see changes in nef expression in
hiv-infected podocytes after atra treatment (figure 6d).

in vivo study
to confirm our in vitro findings, we examined whether treating hiv-1–transgenic mice (tg26) with atra ameliorates hivassociated kidney disease. as shown in figure 7, tg26 mice
developed more proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis than their
littermates. when tg26 mice were treated with atra, they
exhibited significantly reduced proteinuria, cell proliferation,
and glomerulosclerosis, compared with nontreated tg26 mice.
these data indicate that atra exerts protective effects in vivo.

activation of the camp/pka pathway by atra reverses
hiv-1–induced proliferation and dedifferentiation
because atra induces camp production in podocytes, we investigated whether activation of the camp/pka pathway was
sufficient to reverse the effects of hiv-1 on podocytes. hiv-1
podocytes were treated with  xxxd1742xxx  (to stimulate adenylyl cyclase) or exogenous 8-bromo-camp (a camp analogue). both
compounds inhibited hiv-induced podocyte proliferation and
restored the expression of synaptopodin (figure 4). these data
suggest that activation of the camp/pka pathway could be the
mechanism by which atra reverses the effects of hiv-1 on podocytes therefore, we examined whether the actions of atra were
mediated by activation of the camp/pka pathway. rp-camp (a
competitor of endogenous camp) significantly diminished the
inhibitory effect of atra on hiv-1–induced podocyte proliferation
as assessed by the mts cell proliferation assay (figure 5a) and cell
counting (figure 5b). treatment of cells with both  xxxd3142xxx  and
atra to increase camp production were additive in inhibiting
podocyte proliferation (figure 5c). we also found that rp-camp
blocked the ability of atra to stimulate the expression of synaptopodin in hiv-infected podocytes, whereas the effects of atra
were enhanced by  xxxd3142xxx  (figure 5d). these data indicate that
the activation of the camp pathway mediates the effects of atra
on podocytes.

atra inhibits hiv-induced  xxxg1366xxx ,2 and stat3
phosphorylation
we reported previously that hiv stimulates the ras/raf/
 xxxg1366xxx ,2 pathway, leading to podocyte proliferation through
nef (10). we examined whether atra used a cross-talk mechanism with camp to affect  xxxg1366xxx ,2 phosphorylation in podocytes. it is interesting that both atra and  xxxd114xxx   xxxd3417xxx  decreased
hiv-induced  xxxg1366xxx ,2 phosphorylation in a dosage- xxxd2870xxx -

discussion
atra changes hiv-infected podocytes from a pathologic
phenotype to a more differentiated phenotype
this study demonstrates that atra can reverse the pathologic
changes that are observed in hiv-infected podocytes (cell dedifferentiation and proliferation) and in hiv-1–transgenic mice
(proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis). recently, retinoids were
shown to improve kidney diseases in several experimental
animal models, including anti–thy-1 nephritis (13,14),  xxxd3041xxx  aminonucleoside–induced nephrosis (15,16), lupus nephritis (34), and anti– glomerular basement membrane nephritis
(35,36). atra prevents the decrease in synaptopodin, nephrin,
and podocin staining in an anti– glomerular basement membrane glomerular injury model (36).
hiv-associated nephropathy is characterized by podocyte proliferation, loss of contact inhibition, and dedifferentiation, similar
to malignant cells (7–10). in this study, we found that ra blocked

hiv-1–induced proliferation and contact-independent growth
primarily through g1 arrest and decreased expression of  xxxg365xxx 
and cyclin e in hiv-1–infected podocytes. atra also induced
podocyte differentiation manifested by increased expression of
wt-1, nephrin, podocin, and synaptopodin. these findings provide a rationale for using ra to treat hivan and other diseases
of podocyte proliferation, such as idiopathic collapsing fsgs.

atra reverses abnormal phenotype of hiv-infected
podocytes through stimulation of intracellular camp
production
several studies demonstrated that atra induces rapid camp
production and increases pka activity in acute myeloblastic leukemia cells (26). our results demonstrate significant stimulation of
camp production within minutes when podocytes are treated
with either atra or  xxxd3417xxx . this stimulation was amplified
when cells were pretreated with  xxxd3142xxx , an inhibitor of pde4.

ra inhibits hiv-1–induced podocyte proliferation through camp

podocytes express several g protein– coupled receptors (gpcr),
including the ␤2-adrenergic receptor, the d1-dopamine receptor,
and the prostaglandin ip and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors (33,37). activation of
these receptors results in generation of intracellular camp. induction of the camp–pka pathway in podocytes regulates cell morphology, actin assembly, and matrix production (33). in addition,
camp seems to attenuate the effect of hormones that activate the
ca2⫹/pkc pathway (38). overall, the camp pathway seems to
exert a protective effect on podocytes (33). in this study, we found
that the camp/pka pathway mediates the beneficial effects of
atra on podocytes because rp-camp blocked atra-induced differentiation of podocytes. we also found that  xxxd3142xxx  enhanced
the atra effect. these data indicate that atra exerts its effect on
hiv-1–infected podocytes through activation of the camp pathway. treatment with atra alone or in combination with pde
inhibitors could be an effective treatment strategy (in combination
with antivirals) for hivan.

rar␣ mediates the effects of atra on hiv-infected
podocytes
although receptor-independent effects of retinoids have
been described, most studies have shown that rar and/or
rxr play a role in retinoid-induced cellular effects through
either genomic or nongenomic pathways (18,24,26). it was surprising that rar␣, which is suppressed in hiv-infected cells,
still played a critical role in atra’s effects on podocyte phenotype as supported by our data using the rar␣ agonist and
antagonist. how rar␣ mediates atra-induced camp production, however, remains unclear. estrogen can induce camp
production through activation of adenylyl cyclase (39), and a
recent study suggested that estrogen binds to intracellular
gpcr (40). further studies are required to determine whether
there are gpcr that bind atra.

atra inhibits hiv-induced  xxxg1366xxx ,2 and stat3
phosphorylation
in previous studies, we found that hiv nef induced
 xxxg1366xxx ,2 and stat3 activation in podocytes (10,41). inhibition
of  xxxg1366xxx ,2 or stat3 activation suppressed nef-induced cell
proliferation and dedifferentiation (10). here, we found that
atra inhibited both  xxxg1366xxx ,2 and stat3 phosphorylation in
podocytes. atra probably reduces mapk phosphorylation
through activation of mapk phosphatase 1, as this was reported previously (42). it has been reported that atra can
inhibit stat3 activation in leukemia cells (43).

conclusion
we found that atra inhibits proliferation and induces differentiation in hiv-infected podocytes through rar␣-mediated
camp/pka activation. these data provide new insights into the
underlying molecular mechanisms of the podocyte disease of
hivan as well as a novel therapeutic strategy for its treatment.
