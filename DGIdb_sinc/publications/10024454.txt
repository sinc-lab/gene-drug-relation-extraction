 xxxg1856xxx  (psat;  xxxg1856xxx ), a member of subgroup iv of the aminotransferases, catalyses the conversion of 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate to  xxxd1857xxx . the crystal structure of psat from
escherichia coli has been solved in space group p212121 using miras
phases in combination with density modi®cation and was re®ned to an
ê resolution. in addition, the
r-factor of 17.5 % (rfree  20.1 %) at 2.3 a
structure of psat in complex with a-methyl-l-glutamate (amg) has
ê resolution.
been re®ned to an r-factor of 18.5 % (rfree  25.1 %) at 2.8 a
each subunit (361 residues) of the psat homodimer is composed of a
large pyridoxal-50 -phosphate binding domain (residues 16-268), consisting
of a seven-stranded mainly parallel b-sheet, two additional b-strands and
seven a-helices, and a small c-terminal domain, which incorporates a
®ve-stranded b-sheet and two a-helices. a three-dimensional structural
comparison to four other  xxxd3049xxx -dependent enzymes reveals that
three a-helices of the large domain, as well as an n-terminal domain
(subgroup ii) or subdomain (subgroup i) are absent in psat. its only 15
n-terminal residues form a single b-strand, which participates in the
b-sheet of the c-terminal domain. the cofactor is bound through an aldimine linkage to lys198 in the active site. in the psat-amg complex
ser9 and arg335 bind the amg a-carboxylate group while his41, arg42
and his328 are involved in binding the amg side-chain. arg77 binds the
amg side-chain indirectly through a solvent molecule and is expected to
position itself during catalysis between the plp phosphate group and the
substrate side-chain. comparison of the active sites of psat and aspartate aminotransferase suggests a similar catalytic mechanism, except for
the transaldimination step, since in psat the schiff base is protonated.
correlation of the psat crystal structure to a published pro®le sequence
analysis of all subgroup iv members allows active site modelling of  xxxg1562xxx 
and the proposal of a likely molecular reaction mechanism.

structure of  xxxg1856xxx 

introduction
l-serine participates in a number of important
metabolic pathways and is the major source of
one-carbon units in the living cell (ichihara &
greenberg, 1957; walsh & sallach, 1966). its biosynthesis is carried out by the enzymes of the
``phosphorylated pathway''. this involves the d-3phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase-catalysed (ec
1.1.1.95) and nad-linked oxidation of d- xxxd35xxx  to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate, which
in turn is converted to  xxxd1857xxx  in a l-glutamate-linked transamination by  xxxd1857xxx 
aminotransferase (psat,  xxxg1856xxx ):
l-glutamate

 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate

$ 2-oxoglutarate   xxxd1857xxx 
in the ®nal step  xxxd1857xxx  is hydrolysed to
l-serine by l- xxxg1866xxx  (ec
3.1.3.3; ichihara & greenberg, 1957; walsh &
sallach, 1966). d-3- xxxg1739xxx  plays a key role in the regulation of serine biosynthesis because its substrate is an intermediate of
the glycolytic pathway and l-serine regulates the
activity of d-3- xxxg1739xxx  by
feedback inhibition. catalysis by psat and l- xxxg1866xxx  does not appear to be regulated (pizer, 1963; mckitrick & pizer, 1980). it has
been established that the phosphorylated pathway
is functional in many different organisms, from
bacterial cells to higher animals (pizer, 1963;
umbarger et al., 1963; walsh & sallach, 1966;
mckitrick & pizer, 1980).
the aminotransferases are part of the large
a-family of  xxxd3049xxx -dependent enzymes, and
have been subdivided into four subgroups (mehta
et al., 1993; alexander et al., 1994). psat, peroxisomal serine-pyruvate aminotransferases from mammals ( xxxg102xxx ), the small subunit of soluble
hydrogenases from cyanobacteria, isopenicillin-nepimerase and the nif s gene product from bacteria
and yeast belong to or are homologous to subgroup iv aminotransferases (mehta & christen,
1993; mehta et al., 1993; ouzounis & sander, 1993;
zheng et al., 1993; mehta & christen, 1994; zheng
et al., 1994). these enzymes do not show signi®cant
sequence identity to any other known member of
the a-family and, upon sequence alignment, share
a lysine in the region near position 200 which is
probably the plp-binding residue (mehta &
christen, 1993; ouzounis & sander, 1993).
a-family members are characterized by an open
a/b type structure with a typical central sevenstranded b-sheet with order of agfedbc, in which
all strands, except g, are parallel. these proteins
are symmetric a2 dimers or loose multiples (a4, a6,
a12) thereof. they contain one plp molecule per
monomer and the two subunits in the dimer share
two active sites at the subunit interface. in addition
to the large plp-binding a/b domain, each subunit
contains one, two or more smaller domains that
often differ much from enzyme to enzyme,

depending on the reaction catalysed (john, 1995).
the most extensively studied representative of the
a-family is aspartate aminotransferase (ec 2.6.1.1;
ford et al., 1980; jansonius & vincent, 1987; smith
et al., 1989; kamitori et al., 1990; jaèger et al., 1994;
john, 1995). crystal structures of other aminotransferases of the a-family have been solved as well;
e.g. o-amino acid:pyruvate aminotransferase (ec
2.6.1.18) from pseudomonas sp. f-126 (watanabe
et al., 1989), dialkylglycine decarboxylase (ec
4.1.1.64) from pseudomonas cepacia (toney et al.,
1993, 1995), glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminomutase from synechococcus (hennig et al., 1997),
human recombinant  xxxg1621xxx 
(ec 2.6.1.13; shen et al., 1998).
psat has been isolated from several different
sources, like animal tissues (hirsch & greenberg,
1967; lund et al., 1987), bacterial cells (schmidt &
sojka, 1973; lewendon, 1984; duncan & coggins,
1986; o'gaora et al., 1989; battchikova et al.,
1996), yeast (belhumeur et al., 1994) and plant
organisms (cheung et al., 1968; walton &
woolhouse, 1986; reynolds et al., 1988; stolz &
dornemann, 1994; saito et al., 1997). psat from
escherichia coli is a homodimer of mr 79,000 and
consists of 361 residues per subunit. its cofactor
plp is bound through a schiff base with a pka
of 8.4 to the active site residue lys198 (kallen
et al., 1987; figure 1). the ph-dependence of the
enzyme reaction, which follows a pin-pong-bi-bi
mechanism, shows a broad maximum between
ph 7.5 and ph 8.5 (cleland, 1963; kallen et al.
1987). psat from e. coli was originally crystallized 11 years ago (kallen et al., 1987). a ®rst
partial structure solution obtained by multiple
isomorphous replacement (mir) methods and
consisting of a  xxxd2428xxx  model containing 83 %
of all residues was reported by stark et al.
(1991). when further efforts (moser, 1995) did not
lead to signi®cant progress, as an alternative
approach the structure determination of psat
from bacillus circulans subsp. alkalophilus was
initiated (moser et al., 1996). however, powerful
recent methods of phase improvement have now
been successfully applied to e. coli psat and
allowed the elucidation and re®nement of its
three-dimensional structure.
here we present the crystal structures of e. coli
psat (native psat) and of a complex of psat
with the substrate analogue a-methyl-l-glutamate
ê resolution,
(psat-amg), solved at 2.3 and 2.8 a
respectively. this work represents the ®rst structure of a member of subgroup iv of the aminotransferases (mehta & christen, 1993; mehta et al.,
1993; ouzounis & sander, 1993). the topology of
the psat fold, substrate binding, catalysis and
signi®cant differences between psat and other
 xxxd3049xxx -dependent enzymes are discussed. correlation of the two psat crystal structures to a
pro®le of aligned sequences of all subgroup iv
enzymes allows us to suggest a correction of a
proposed reaction mechanism for the nif s gene
product, one of the nitrogen ®xation genes that

encodes a cysteine desulphurase involved in metallocluster formation (mehta & christen, 1993;
ouzounis & sander, 1993; zheng et al., 1993, 1994).

the structure of psat was solved by multiple
isomorphous replacement and anomalous scattering (miras; see materials and methods). the
powerful combination of maximum likelihood
heavy atom re®nement and new density modi®cation methods was instrumental in solving the
problems previously encountered during the structure determination (otwinowski, 1991; cowtan &
main, 1996), in combination with the recollection
of native data on a powerful area detector.
the only useful data set out of many trials with
substrate and inhibitor complexes was obtained by
soaking a native psat crystal in a solution containing amg (psat-amg). analysis of a simulated annealing omit fo ÿ fc map and a 2fo ÿ fc
map (figure 2), generated after exhaustive torsion
angle re®nement (see materials and methods;
hodel et al., 1992; rice & bruènger, 1994), suggested
binding of amg in subunit a as an external aldimine, formed between amg and plp (figure 1),
while subunit b most likely does not bind amg to
a signi®cant degree. observations that support this
hypothesis are the crystal packing, suggestive of a
signi®cantly more accessible active site of subunit
a in comparison to subunit b (figure 3), the active
site of which is blocked by a neighbouring molecule, and the density observed in the active site of
subunit b which is very similar to that of the active
sites of the unligated native psat structure. the
psat-amg model was therefore subsequently edited and further re®ned according to this interpretation of the data.
as summarized in table 1, the atomic models of
native psat and psat-amg display excellent
geometry and were re®ned with r-factors of 17.5 %
(rfree  20.1 %) and 18.5 % (rfree  25.1 %), respectively. the higher rfree of the psat-amg model
re¯ects the lower quality of the psat-amg data

set (bruènger, 1992). the ®rst residue of psat, a
methionine, is cleaved off in a post-translational
process and is therefore not present in the mature
enzyme (duncan & coggins, 1986). however, the
362 residue numbering is used here. the atomic
model of the psat-amg complex compares closely to that of native psat. superpositions yielded
ê for all atoms and 0.29 a
ê for
rmsd values of 0.65 a
ca atoms only. since both models represent the
same crystal form and care has been taken to re®ne
both models according to the same principles, signi®cant differences between the two models should
be mainly induced by ligand binding and differences in quality and resolution of the x-ray data.
overall fold
analysis of the secondary structure of psat
with program procheck (laskowski et al., 1993)
reveals an open a/b type structure (figure 4). each
subunit of the psat homodimer (duncan &
coggins, 1986) consists of two domains and has an
ê  60 a
ê  25 a
ê . the large
approximate size of 60 a
domain is formed by residues 16-268 and contains
the typical seven-stranded b-sheet observed in all
a-family aminotransferases (jansonius & vincent,
1987; john, 1995), two additional, individual
b-strands and six a-helices. a seventh a-helix (residues 260-282) connects the large domain with the

small domain (residues 3-15 and 269-362), a rather
compact structure consisting of two a-helices and
an extended ®ve-stranded b-sheet that is formed
by a combination of a two-stranded parallel
b-sheet (including the b-strand contributed by the
n-terminal part of the small domain) and a
three-stranded antiparallel b-sheet. the n-terminal
b-strand is followed by a sharp turn initiated by a
cis peptide bond between gly10 and pro11. the
®ve-stranded b-sheet is covered by the long a-helix
coming from the large domain and two additional
a-helices (one of these being the c-terminal helix).
a total of eight 310-helices or helical turns are
observed per subunit, situated either between two
b-strands or at the n terminus of an a-helix
(figure 4).
in the psat crystal there is one dimer per asymmetric unit. the subunits are related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis. the dimer has a rather
open structure (figure 4(b) and (c)). nevertheless,
the subunit interface is quite extensive. it involves
residues 4, 6, 8, 11-14 and 323 of the small domain
and residues 19-20, 23-24, 26-27, 32-34, 37-39, 41,
73-74, 77, 78, 81, 109, 112-113, 197, 203, 220-225,

comparison of the overall folds of vitamin
b6-dependent enzymes
the dali algorithm was employed for threedimensional structural comparisons (holm &
sander, 1993). the four highest scoring similar
structures were: 2,2-dialkylglycine decarboxylase
(dgd; toney et al., 1995), tyrosine phenol-lyase
(tpl; antson et al., 1993), aat (ford et al., 1980;
mcphalen et al., 1992a; smith et al., 1989; kamitori
et al., 1990; jaèger et al., 1994; john, 1995) and
 xxxg1626xxx  (od; momany et al.,
1995a,b), all of which are  xxxd3049xxx -dependent
enzymes. aspartate aminotransferase from e. coli
was used for comparison purposes (smith et al.,
1989; kamitori et al., 1990; jaèger et al., 1994). coor-

dinates of further  xxxd3049xxx -dependent enzymes
related to psat were not yet released at the time
this work was performed (watanabe et al., 1989;
clausen et al., 1996; hennig et al., 1997; shen et al.,
1998).
aat, dgd and psat belong to subgroups i, ii
and iv of the transaminases within the a family
of  xxxd3049xxx -dependent enzymes, respectively
(mehta & christen, 1993, 1994; mehta et al., 1993;
ouzounis & sander, 1993; alexander et al., 1994).
tpl also has been assigned to the a-family but not
to any of the three subgroups speci®cally (christen
et al., 1994; alexander et al., 1994). od is a prokaryotic  xxxg1626xxx  that has been
assigned to subgroup iii of the decarboxylases
(sandmeier et al., 1994). a distinct relationship
between subgroups i, ii and iii of the decarboxylase family and the family of aminotransferases has
been established (sandmeier et al., 1994; momany
et al., 1995b). the functional unit of all ®ve compared enzymes is a dimer even though dgd and
tpl are tetramers (a ``dimer of dimers'') and od is
a dodecamer (a ``hexamer of dimers''). structural
comparisons of aat, tpl, dgd and od have
established strong similarities with respect to structure and topology comprising a conserved large
domain (seven-stranded b-sheet surrounded by
eight to nine a-helices) and a conserved small
domain (four to ®ve-stranded b-sheet covered by

834

three a-helices; antson et al., 1993; momany et al.,
1995a,b; toney et al., 1995). the 3d structure comparisons with dali con®rm these ®ndings
(figure 5(a) and 5(b)). however, three regions in
the large domain of psat (residues 133-141, 160-

166 and 181-189) deviate signi®cantly from all four
enzymes included in the comparison. the equivalent regions of aat, od, tpl and dgd form regular a-helices while in psat only unclassi®ed coil

from top to bottom (the identi®er and sequence identity with respect to psat from e. coli are listed): escherichia coli
(psat ecoli; 100 %), salmonella gallinarum (serc salgl; 89.8 %), salmonella typhimurium (serc salty; 88.7 %),
yersinia enterocolitica (serc yeren; 75.6 %), haemophilus in¯uenzae (serc haein; 53.3 %), bacillus circulans subsp.

45.4 %), rabbit (psat rabit; 49.3 %), arabidopsis thaliana (psat arath; 49.7 %), spinach (serc spiol; 49.2 %), saccharomyces cerevisiae (serc yeast; 40.6 %), schizosaccharomyces pombe (serc schpo; 34.9 %), mycobacterium tuberculosis (serc myctu; 21.6 %), methanosarcina barkeri (serc metba; 19.7 %).

(c) display the same molecular orientation and were prepared using programs molscript (kraulis, 1991) and
raster3d (bacon & anderson, 1988; merrit & murphy, 1994).

three regions (residues 133-141 and 181-189) is
observed (figure 4(a)). apart from a crystal contact
formed by lys132 of subunit b none of these three
deviating regions in psat is involved in crystal or
inter-subunit contacts, nor are they part of or close
to the active site. the observed density in the three
regions is well de®ned with average temperature
ê 2 for residues
factors of 46.8, 40.0 and 32.7 a
133-141, 160-166 and 181-189, respectively. the six
a-helices of the large domain of psat all have
topologically equivalent partners in the four compared enzymes (figure 5(a) and 5(b)). recently, the
crystal structure of psat from bacillus circulans
subsp. alkalophilus was determined by molecular
replacement using the atomic model of native
psat from escherichia coli as a search model (to be

published elsewhere). a comparison of the two
psat structures shows that the three discussed
regions are completely conserved with respect to
position and topology, indicating that the absence
of three regular a-helices in the large domain with
respect to other currently known aminotransferase
structures is a conserved general feature of psat.
another striking difference with the known
structures of a-family enzymes is the following.
instead of an n-terminal domain like in dgd, for
example, or an n-terminal arm followed by a subdomain of the small domain as in aat, in psat
only 15 residues precede the large domain. this
n-terminal stretch forms a single b-strand which
attaches to strand b13 of the pleated sheet in the
c-terminal small domain (figure 4(a)). a small

domain topology consisting of ®ve b-strands and
three a-helices is observed in psat, dgd and tpl
(antson et al., 1993; toney et al., 1995). in od the
small domain is formed only by c-terminal residues due to its different domain structure which
results in loss of the n-terminal b-strand (momany
et al., 1995a,b). aat lacks one of the four antiparallel b-strands of the c-terminal part of the small
domain and the relative orientation of the small
domain with respect to the large domain is quite
different (figure 5(a); ford et al., 1980; mcphalen
et al., 1992a,b; smith et al., 1989; kamitori et al.,
1990; jaèger et al., 1994; john, 1995). the greater
structural differences of the small domains of od
and aat are probably responsible for the lower
similarity scores (not shown) with psat in comparison with tpl and dgd.
in summary, three a-helices of the large domain
are absent in psat with concomitant shortening of
the polypeptide chain and deviation in large
domain topology with respect to the four compared enzymes. the small domain of psat is
smaller as well although the topology is conserved

in the c-terminal part. as a result psat has the
smallest structure known so far for an aminotransferase, except for d-amino acid aminotransferase,
which has a different fold (sugio et al., 1995).
active site
the two active sites of the psat dimer are situê apart at the subunit interated approximately 20 a
face and are formed by residues of both large
domains and one small domain. this feature, typical for  xxxd3049xxx -dependent enzymes of the
a-family, implies that the complete dimer is essential for activity (jansonius & vincent, 1987; john,
1995). a sequence alignment of all available psat
sequences shows that (active site) residues his41,
arg42, gly76, trp102, thr153, asp174, ser176,
ser177, gln197, lys198, asn239, thr240, his328,
arg329 and arg335 are nearly fully conserved
(figure 4(a)).
in each active site a plp molecule is bound in an
aldimine linkage to lys198 and is additionally
hydrogen bonded to residues of the two large

a water molecule (wat93) to od2 and from the
peptide n and the side-chain hydroxyl of ser176 to
od1. these interactions ®x the position and orientation of the aspl74 carboxylate, which in turn contributes to the proper anchoring of the cofactor.
the o30 atom of the pyridine ring of plp is the
acceptor of a hydrogen bond from thr153 in
psat-amg. thr153 could actually adopt a different side-chain conformation in native psat and
bind to o30 but it seems to prefer the interaction
with the nitrogen of the indole ring of trp102. five
of the plp-binding residues are situated near the c
terminus of one of three b-strands from the canonical seven-stranded b-sheet in the large domain
(jansonius & vincent, 1987; john, 1995) : thr153
(b6); asp174 and ser177 (b8); gln197 and lys198
(b9). the six remaining plp-binding residues
(gly76, arg77, tyr101, trp102 and asn239-thr240
from the neighbouring subunit) are situated near
the n termini of a-helices a3, a4 and a6
(figure 4(a)). the phosphate group of plp makes
electrostatic interactions with the positive ®elds at
the n termini of these a-helical dipoles, especially
of helix a3. the involvement of the seven-stranded
b-sheet and the a-helices in formation of the active
site and binding of plp is a conserved feature of
 xxxd3049xxx -dependent enzymes of the a-family
(ford et al., 1980; jansonius & vincent, 1987; smith
et al., 1989; watanabe et al., 1989; kamitori et al.,
1990; antson et al., 1993; jaèger et al., 1994; john,
1995; momany et al., 1995a,b; toney et al., 1995).
his328 and arg329 of the small domain of the
same subunit and his41 and arg42 of the large
domain of the neighbouring subunit are located
near the n terminus of a-helix a2 and in a loop
between b-strands b13 and b14, respectively
(figure 4(a)). these four residues are oriented in
two pairs and opposite each other in the active
site, ideally suited for binding the highly charged
and bulky substrate phosphate group (figure 6(b)).
arg335 is part of the last b-strand of the small
domain and, based on its position in the active site
and the 3d structural comparisons, is the likely
candidate for binding the substrate a-carboxylate
group, an essential function (figures 4(a) and 6;
jansonius & vincent, 1987; john, 1995).
amg is (in subunit a) bound covalently to plp
as an external aldimine. it is oriented in the active
site through a strong hydrogen bond between its
a-carboxylate group and ser9 and by a close electrostatic interaction between its g-carboxylate
group and arg42 of the neighbouring subunit
(figures 2 and 6(b); table 2). the side-chain conformation of amg is almost ideal with energetically
favourable torsion angles. one water molecule is
involved in binding amg. it can make strong
hydrogen bonds to the phosphate group of plp,
the g-carboxylate group of amg and the guanidinium group of arg77. some changes in plp binding and conformation are observed upon
formation of the psat-amg complex: plp has
rotated approximately 20  around its c5-c50 bond,
lys198 is a free residue again and forms a hydro-

structure of  xxxg1856xxx 

gen bond to the o30 atom of the pyridinium ring of
plp and thr153 changes its side-chain conformation allowing it to form a strong hydrogen bond
to the o30 atom of the pyridinium ring of plp
(figures 1 and 6(b)). the hydrogen-bonded ion
pair between asp174 and the protonated n1 atom
of the plp pyridinium ring stays intact. however,
instead of the expected hydrogen bonds, only van
der waals contacts are observed between the substrate a-carboxylate group and arg335 and
between the substrate g-carboxylate group and
his41 and his328 while arg329 is too far away to
bind to amg. the observed non-optimal binding
mode could be the combined result of the small
domain being restricted by crystal lattice contacts
ê between the carbonyl
and the close contact of 3.6 a
group of gly10 and the a-methyl group of amg,
which is absent in the physiological substrate. formation of a closed structure (in analogy to aat)
would cause the small domain residue gly10 to
move closer to amg, resulting in increased steric
repulsion. optimal interactions between active site
residues and substrate are therefore probably
prohibited.
four bound solvent molecules are observed in at
least three of the four active sites of the combined
psat structures. one solvent molecule mediates
hydrogen bonds of gly10 and thr240 to plp while
a second mediates a hydrogen bond of arg77 to
plp. the third and fourth solvent molecules bind
to arg42 and to arg335, respectively.
comparisons of active sites of vitamin
b6-dependent enzymes
the 3d structural alignments utilizing dali (not
shown) enable a comparison of the important
active site residues of psat to possible functional
analogues in od, tpl, dgd and aat (ford et al.,
1980; jansonius & vincent, 1987; smith et al., 1989;
kamitori et al., 1990; antson et al., 1993; jaèger et al.,
1994; john, 1995; momany et al., 1995a,b; toney
et al., 1995; see table 3). as expected, 3d structural
alignment of the ®ve enzymes con®rms that
asp174 and lys198 are strictly conserved throughout the a-family of  xxxd3049xxx -dependent enzymes
while arg335 is conserved in all aminotransferases
(mehta et al., 1993; alexander et al., 1994; mehta &
christen, 1994). all enzymes have an aromatic residue capable of forming favourable stacking interactions with plp at the position equivalent to
trp102 in psat. in tpl, tyr122 is the likely equivalent of trp102 in psat. all residues equivalent to
gln197, with the exception of ser271 of dgd, seem
to play similar roles in binding the plp phosphate
group (table 2). asn239 and thr240 are not strictly
conserved. even so, they are replaced by residues
with comparable hydrogen-bonding properties.
his41, arg42, his328 and arg329, the residues
postulated to bind the substrate phosphate group,
are not conserved in tpl, od, dgd and aat but
are conserved in all aligned psat sequences and

the dali algorithm (holm & sander, 1993) was used to make the structural comparisons. in parentheses the protein data bank
id of the compared enzyme is listed (bernstein et al., 1977).
a
the listed residues of tpl are speculative because the tpl structure corresponds to the apoenzyme. a sulphate ion is bound at
the assumed binding site of the plp phosphate (antson et al., 1993).
b
7aat, 1aaw and 1asl protein data bank entries were utilized for dali searches. the sequence numbering of the 7aat protein data bank entry is used throughout.

therefore probably form a unique signature of
psat (figure 4(a)).
in psat, arg77 makes a hydrogen bond to the
plp phosphate group and also seems to play a
role in binding the substrate (figure 6(a) and (b)).
the presumed dual role of this residue is probably
different from the function of the equivalent residues in dgd, tpl, od and aat as judged from
analysis of the superimposed structures and the literature (jansonius & vincent, 1987; smith et al.,
1989; kamitori et al., 1990; mcphalen et al., 1992b;
antson et al., 1993; jaèger et al., 1994; john, 1995;
momany et al., 1995a,b; toney et al., 1995). in subunit a of native psat, arg77 adopts two alternative conformations, binding either directly to the
plp phosphate group or indirectly through a solvent molecule, while in subunit b of native psat
and in both subunits of psat-amg only the latter
conformation is observed where arg77 binds plp
indirectly (figure 6). the two conformations of
arg77 in subunit a of native psat differ mainly in
the torsion angle w4, which adopts a value of either
ÿ51  or 106  . the difference in solvent accessibility of the two psat subunits could explain why
arg77 is less ordered in subunit a of native psat.
on the assumption that the substrate  xxxd1857xxx  binds just like amg the estimated distance
between the phosphate groups of plp and  xxxd1857xxx  in an external aldimine adduct of psat
and  xxxd1857xxx  would only be approximately
ê . optimal stabilization would be achieved by
7a
placing the guanidinium group of arg77 between
the two phosphate groups, instead of a solvent
molecule. in an oxime complex of mitochondrial
aat with the monocarboxylic hydroxylamine analogue of  xxxd233xxx ,  xxxd439xxx , arg292, the
residue that binds the substrate o-carboxylate
group, made a hydrogen-bonded ion pair with the
carboxylate of the inhibitor, but was observed to
adopt two alternative conformations in the open
crystal form while adopting only one conformation
in the closed crystal form (markovic-housley et al.,
1996). since arg42 and arg77 of psat both take

part in binding the amg g-carboxylate group
(table 2), these two residues probably perform the
same function as arg292 in aat which is contributed by the neighbouring subunit, just like arg42 in
psat.
figure 7(a) and (b) shows the cofactor and
selected active site residues of native psat superimposed, using dali, on the corresponding
regions of aat and dgd, respectively. the conformation of the latter resembles that of psat most
closely, in spite of its different reaction and substrate speci®city. while the a-carbon atoms of
lys258, asp222 and trp140 of aat superimpose
reasonably well on those of lys198, asp174 and
trp102 of psat (table 3), the phosphate group of
plp deviates strongly in the two enzymes. this
presumably is a consequence of the relative shift of
helix a3 in psat and helix a5 in aat, at the n terminus of which the phosphate group is bound.
possibly, arg266, which makes two hydrogen
bonds to the plp phosphate in aat (mcphalen
et al., 1992a) and has no counterpart in psat and
dgd, is also in part responsible for this shift,
which results in different orientations of the two
cofactors. in spite of this, the tryptophan indole
groups stack parallel to the pyridine rings in both
enzymes. the different positions of arg386 of aat
and arg335 of psat are a consequence of the nonequivalent positions of the small domains in the
two enzymes (figure 5(a)). there are no further
conserved active site residues (table 3; figure 7(a)).
arg b292 of aat is replaced in psat by arg a77
and arg b42 on either side of it, in line with the
double negative charge of the phosphate group of
its substrate. the involvement of a third arginine,
arg a329, cannot be excluded as an alternative to
arg a77.
as mentioned above, the active sites of psat
and dgd superimpose better. this is most obvious
for the cofactors. in fact, comparison of figure 5(a)
and (b) reveals the more similar overall folds, as
exempli®ed for example by the better superposition of the phosphate-binding a-helices a3 and a4,

accordingly, arg335 in psat and arg406 in dgd

superimpose rather well. the indole of trp138 in

instead, it provides a non-polar surface contributing to one of the three substrate subsites (toney
et al., 1995). asp243 in dgd and aspl74 in psat
superimpose well. the same is true for gln246 in
dgd and ser177 in psat, with as consequence
that the latter with its shorter side-chain cannot
quite make a hydrogen bond with the plp o30 . no
further similarities can be found (table 3;
figure 7(b)).
a comparison of substrate analogue
complexes of psat and aat
comparison of the psat-amg complex with a
similar complex of aat from escherichia coli, that
with a-methyl- xxxd233xxx  (aat-ama; figures 5(a)
and 7(c)), allows us to analyse possible differences
and similarities between psat and the best studied representative of the aminotransferases, aat
(dunathan, 1971; ford et al., 1980; jansonius &
vincent, 1987; smith et al., 1989; kamitori et al.,
1990; goldberg et al., 1991; inoue et al., 1991;
mcphalen et al., 1992a,b; yano et al., 1993; jaèger
et al., 1994; john, 1995; markovic-housley et al.,
1996). first, the plp cofactor in the aat-ama
complex has a quite different orientation compared
to plp in the psat-amg complex. the most relevant structural differences responsible for this are
the already mentioned shift of a-helix 5 of aatama with respect to helix a3 of psat and the
hydrogen bonding of arg266 of aat-ama with
the plp phosphate group (figures 4(a), 5(a) and
7(c); jaèger et al., 1994). a similar interaction of an
arginine with the plp phosphate group is not
observed in od, tpl, dgd and psat. binding of
the plp phosphate group to the n terminus of an
a-helix (helix 5 in aat), on the other hand, is a
conserved feature of  xxxd3049xxx -dependent
enzymes (john, 1995). the different relative orientations of the small domains of psat and aat
mentioned above (figure 5(a)) has the effect that
arg386 of aat does not superimpose on arg335
of psat. their guanidinium head groups are only
ê apart (figure 7(c)).
ê , but their ca atoms 7.8 a
4.0 a
another difference is that contrary to the situation
in aat there is very little space in the active site of
psat for the methyl group of amg, already in
the present, supposedly open, conformation, as
demonstrated by the above described observed
close contact with the carbonyl group of gly10.
this difference should, however, not in¯uence the
catalytic mechanism signi®cantly when one of the
regular substrates is bound.
a fourth signi®cant difference between aat and
psat is the pka value of the imine nitrogen of the
internal schiff base. for aat this value is about
6.5, causing aat to be largely unprotonated near
neutral ph where the enzyme is active while for
psat this pka value is 8.4, implying that the imine
nitrogen of the internal schiff base is up to 90 %
protonated at ph 7.5-8.5 where the enzyme is
active (jansonius & vincent, 1987; kallen et al.,
1987; john, 1995). actually, aat is an exception

841
because for most aminotransferases the imine
nitrogen of the internal schiff base is protonated in
their active state (john, 1995). asn194 of aat,
topologically equivalent to thr153 (table 3), forms
a hydrogen bond to atom o30 of the plp pyridinium ring and to the side-chain of arg386, equivalent to arg335 of psat. the postulated role of
asn194 is to decrease the pka value of the internal
aldimine group, facilitating the transaldimination
step of the catalytic reaction, and to contribute to
the proper orientation of the arg386 side-chain for
binding to the substrate a-carboxylate group. the
aat residue tyr225, equivalent to ser177, binds to
the o30 atom of plp as well and in doing so also
lowers the pka value of the internal aldimine
group (goldberg et al., 1991; inoue et al., 1991;
yano et al., 1993). in the unligated state of psat no
hydrogen bond to atom o30 of plp is made. contrary to asn194 of aat, thr153 only contributes a
hydrogen bond to atom o30 of plp when amg is
bound, and does not interact with arg335 at all
(table 2). instead, residue ser9 makes a hydrogen
bond to arg335 and amg. therefore, the insuf®cient stabilization of the negative charge of atom
o30 of plp by hydrogen bonding may well explain
why the pka value of the imine nitrogen of the
internal schiff's base of psat is so high. the alignment of psat sequences (figure 4(a)) shows that
thr153 and ser177 are completely conserved while
only in four out of 15 sequences a serine or asparagine residue is found at position 9. a search for a
different residue with a similar function as ser9
by relating the crystal structures of psat from
b. circulans subsp. alkalophilus and e. coli to the
aligned psat sequences was not successful. these
results suggest that in most psat enzymes from
different sources the functions of asn194 and
tyr225 of aat are likely to be performed by
thr153 and possibly ser177, which in e. coli psat
is a little too far away to contribute signi®cantly.
although the comparison of psat to aat has
revealed differences with respect to cofactor and
substrate binding, some similarities are observed
as well when comparing the psat-amg and
aat-ama complexes. first, the substrate analogues amg and ama are oriented in the active
site in a similar way, interacting with corresponding regions of the respective active sites
(figure 7(c)). secondly, the ca-ch3 bond in the
plp-amg external aldimine is perpendicular to
the conjugated double bond system of the cofactor
(figures 2 and 6(b)). this orientation is also
observed in the aat-ama complex (figure 7(c))
and is the most favourable one for release of the
ca-proton from the substrate (dunathan, 1971;
jansonius & vincent, 1987; john, 1995). in both
complexes the plp-binding lysine is ideally positioned to deprotonate the substrate ca of the plpsubstrate external aldimine and subsequently
reprotonate the adduct of the c40 atom of plp
which are, at least in aat, partially rate-limiting
steps in the catalytic mechanism (dunathan, 1971;

842
kirsch et al., 1984; jansonius & vincent, 1987;
kuramitsu et al., 1990; goldberg & kirsch, 1996).
psat compared to other subgroup iv enzymes
four invariant residues have been identi®ed in
all aminotransferases. in psat these are apart
from the above described plp-binding lysine
(lys198), the aspartate that forms a salt bridge to
the pyridinium nitrogen of plp (asp174), the arginine that binds the a-carboxylate group of the substrate (arg335), and a glycine present in a turn at
the interface between the small and large domains
(gly156) (mehta et al., 1993). pro®le sequence analysis has indicated the homology of several gene
products to psat and serine aminotransferase,
suggesting that these proteins are most closely
related to subgroup iv of the aminotransferases:
the small subunit of soluble hydrogenases from
cyanobacteria, isopenicillin-n-epimerase and the
nif s gene product from bacteria and yeast (mehta
& christen, 1993, 1994; mehta et al., 1993;
ouzounis & sander, 1993). apart from the invariant aminotransferase residues described above
three additional ones have been identi®ed in subgroup iv (mehta & christen, 1993; ouzounis &
sander, 1993): gly204 is part of a loop between bstrands b9 and b10, asp306 is situated at the
amino terminus of 310-helix g8 and thr240 is positioned in a loop near the amino terminus of a-helix
a6 (figure 4(a)). gly204 and asp306 do not have
an obvious mechanistic function while thr240 contributes to binding the plp phosphate group, as
described above.
correlation of a pro®le sequence analysis of all
known members of subgroup iv to the psat crystal structure allows us to determine additional conserved active site residues (ouzounis & sander,
1993). conserved residues are likely to have one of
three possible functions: to bind plp, to bind the
non-varying part of the substrate (a-carboxylate
group) or to play a catalytic role. the analysis indicated that the plp-binding residues gly76, arg77,
ser177 and asn239 are probably not conserved
while gln197 in the other members is either a glutamine or a histidine, also capable of binding a
phosphate group. trp102 is largely conserved and
might be replaced by a histidine in the nif s gene
products, assuming it is shifted by four residues in
serine aminotransferase and the nif s gene products. thr153 seems to be conserved in all subgroup iv members, except for two of the six nif s
gene product sequences, and it is with thr240 one
of only two subgroup iv-speci®c plp-binding
residues.
ser9, like arg335 involved in binding the a-carboxylate group of amg (table 2), is not conserved
in subgroup iv. as expected, arg42, arg77 and
arg329 are also not conserved, since they are
involved in binding the psat-speci®c part of its
substrate. however, his41 and his328, likewise
involved in binding the substrate, might be exceptions. in all  xxxg1562xxx  gene products his41 is probably

structure of  xxxg1856xxx 

replaced by a histidine at position 40 while his328
is conserved in the soluble dehydrogenase
sequences and is replaced in all nif s gene product
sequences by a cysteine with an important catalytic
function (ouzounis & sander, 1993; zheng et al.,
1993, 1994). not much information is currently
available about the small subunit of soluble hydrogenases from cyanobacteria and isopenicillin-nepimerase. correlation of their sequences to the
psat crystal structure does not lead to any new
suggestions for possible functionally important
active site residues.
substrate specificity
experiments with psat from the green alga
(scenedesmus obliquus) have shown that with two
exceptions none of several substrate analogues
examined revealed more than 2.5 % of the enzyme
activity for  xxxd1857xxx  (stolz & dornemann,
1995). only 4,5-dioxovalerate and glutamate-lsemialdehyde behaved clearly as substrates, exhibiting 7 % and 7.4 % of the activity for  xxxd1857xxx , respectively. studies with psat from beef
liver revealed that this enzyme accepts 2 -amino-4phosphonobutyrate, 2-amino-5-phosphono-valerate
and homocysteate as substrates, although speci®c
activities towards these compounds were not
reported (basurko et al., 1989). it was established
for psat from b. circulans subsp. alkalophilus that it
is responsible for the majority of the total
measured aat activity (battchikova et al., 1996).
also psat from e. coli has been reported to readily
accept  xxxd233xxx  as a substrate (lewendon,
1984).
the active site of psat is optimised for binding
its substrates l-glutamate, 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate and  xxxd1857xxx . all four
molecules have side-chains of equal length. analysis of the psat-amg complex seems to suggest
that despite the reduced length of the side-chain of
 xxxd233xxx  in comparison to l-glutamate or  xxxd1857xxx , it should be bound suf®ciently well to
be a substrate, due to the presence of several arginine residues in the active site that can make ion
pairs, and probably hydrogen bonds as well, with
the aspartate side-chain.
catalytic mechanism
it is interesting to compare the catalytic mechanism of psat with that of the related enzyme aat
since they both work on substrates with a negatively charged side-chain (ford et al., 1980; kirsch
et al., 1984; jansonius & vincent, 1987; smith et al.,
1989; kamitori et al., 1990; kuramitsu et al., 1990;
goldberg et al., 1991; inoue et al., 1991; mcphalen
et al., 1992a,b; yano et al., 1993; jaèger et al., 1994;
john, 1995; goldberg & kirsch, 1996; markovichousley et al., 1996). the ®rst chemical step in the
catalytic mechanism of aat concerns the transfer,
in the michaelis complex, of a proton of the
charged substrate amino group to the unproto-

843

structure of  xxxg1856xxx 

nated imine nitrogen of the internal schiff base, followed by nucleophilic attack of the substrate
amino group on the c4' carbon atom of the cofactor, resulting in formation of the external aldimine
intermediate between plp and the substrate. subsequently, deprotonation of the a-carbon atom of
the substrate followed by reprotonation at the c40
carbon atom of plp to produce the ketimine intermediate take place. finally its hydrolysis to the
oxo acid product and release of that complete the
catalytic half-reaction.
at physiological ph values, the plp-aldimine
nitrogen of psat is largely protonated (kallen
et al., 1987) and consequently transaldimination is
slowed down considerably. the small percentage
of the substrate molecules with an uncharged
a-amino group could immediately react with the
schiff-base-protonated form of psat, a reaction
pathway recently suggested by hayashi & kagamiyama (1997). alternatively, the psat molecules
with unprotonated schiff base can react with the
substrate molecules with charged a-amino groups.
an active site group that has both the correct position and proton af®nity to attract the third proton
of the substrate a-amino group is lacking. the
alternative reactions listed above are probably suf®cient.
the above described comparison of the psatamg and aat-ama complexes has revealed
similarities in substrate binding. in both enzymes
the external aldimine adduct is oriented in the
active site in a similar way and interacts with the
same regions. the ca ± ch3 bond in the plp-amg
external aldimine is perpendicular to the conjugated double bond system of the cofactor, a most
favourable orientation for release of the ca-proton
from the substrate, and the plp binding lysine is
ideally positioned to deprotonate the substrate ca
and reprotonate the adduct of the c40 atom of plp.
the observed similarities suggest that the second
part of the catalytic half-reaction, formation of the
ketimine intermediate and its hydrolysis to the oxo
acid product, are likely to proceed by a similar
mechanism in psat and aat.
a proposal for the catalytic mechanism of the
nif s gene product
a possible mechanism for the desulphurization
of l-cysteine catalysed by the nif s gene product
has been proposed by zheng et al. (1994). after
entry of the substrate l-cysteine in the active site of
the nif s gene product an external aldimine is
formed with plp by nucleophilic attack of the substrate amino group on the c40 atom of plp. in the
next step of the proposed catalytic mechanism the
a-carbon atom of the substrate is deprotonated and
a cysteinyl residue (cys325) protonates the c40
atom of the cysteine-pyridoxal quinonoid intermediate which activates it as a nucleophile. subsequently, the cys325 sÿ carries out a nucleophilic
attack on the resulting cysteine-pyridoxal ketimine
intermediate. this leads to the formation of a pro-

tein-bound persulphide, the proposed sulphur
donor in fe-s core formation, and the plp-ketimine of the product, l-alanine, which in the ®nal
step of the catalytic mechanism is released.
although the above described mechanism is a
plausible proposal, the suggested protonation of
the c40 atom of the cysteine-pyridoxal quinonoid
intermediate by cys325 does not seem to be very
probable. the plp-binding lysine is a priori more
likely to perform this function, as in aspartate
aminotransferase (jansonius & vincent, 1987; john,
1995) and, presumably, in psat, because it is
optimally positioned to do so (figures 6(b) and
7(c)). a different mechanism for the activation of
the catalytic cysteine would therefore be required.
the potentially conserved his41 of psat, proposed to be present at position 40 in the nif s gene
product, would be a possible candidate for deprotonation of the catalytic cysteine side-chain. utilizing the psat-amg complex as a starting model, a
cysteine replacing his328 (structural equivalent of
cys325), a cysteine replacing the inhibitor amg,
forming a quinonoid intermediate with plp, and a
histidine replacing ser40 of the neighbouring subunit (as described above), were modelled in the
active site. they were arranged and positioned
with near-optimal side-chain conformations to
improve their interactions (figure 8). the modelling experiment suggests an approximate distance
ê between the sulphur of the catalytic cysteine
of 6 a
side-chain and the histidine side-chain of the
neighbouring subunit, too far away to allow deprotonation of the catalytic cysteine side-chain. however, the local conformation of the main-chain in
the active site of the nif s gene product might suf®ciently deviate from that of psat to bring the histidine side-chain much closer. sequence identities
below 25 % for members of subgroup iv make considerable structural deviations especially of the
dimeric quaternary structure, likely (mehta &
christen, 1993; ouzounis & sander, 1993). the
approximate distance between the two modelled
ê . assumcysteine side-chain sulphur atoms is 4.3 a
ing that the catalytic cysteine, being part of the
small domain, approaches the cysteine moiety in
the quinonoid intermediate more closely during
catalysis, this distance might be further reduced,
allowing nucleophilic attack by the catalytic
cysteine. alternatively, at ph values around 8 the
cys325 thiol group may be ionized for a suf®cient
fraction of the time that a catalyst for its deprotonation is unnecessary.

conclusions
the structure of psat provides insight into the
structural differences of a representative of subgroup iv with respect to other aminotransferases
of subgroups i and ii. the most signi®cant topological difference is the absence of three canonical
a-helices in the large domain of psat and
reduction of the n terminus to a single b-strand.

analysis of the active site of psat and of the
complex with amg demonstrates that the enzyme
is well adapted for binding a highly negatively
charged substrate side-chain. the substrate a-carboxylate group is bound by a conserved arginine,
typical for aminotransferases, and a serine which is
not even conserved in the aligned psat sequences
and is therefore probably not essential for the catalytic function of psat. two histidine/arginine
pairs, each at one side of the active site, are available to compensate for the three to four negative
charges of the plp phosphate group and the substrate side-chain, in close proximity to each other.
only one of the two arginine residues makes a
hydrogen bond with amg, however. a third arginine binds the amg side-chain indirectly through
a solvent molecule but is expected to position itself
during catalysis between the plp phosphate group
and the substrate side-chain. comparison to other
aminotransferases and a sequence alignment of all
known psat sequences leads to the conclusion
that this particular residue arrangement in the
active site is probably unique for psat.
the absence of stabilization for the o30 atom of
plp in psat provides a possible explanation for
the high pka value of the imine nitrogen of the
internal schiff base. the resulting protonation of
the imine nitrogen at the ph range where psat is
active has consequences for the catalytic mechanism. however, comparison of the psat-amg complex with that of aat with a-methylaspartate
revealed analogous orientations of the external
aldimine adducts and the plp-binding lysine residues and a most favourable orientation in both
complexes of the substrate ca ± ch3 bond with
respect to the cofactor conjugate double bond system. therefore, it is not unlikely that the catalytic
mechanism of psat differs from aat only in the
®rst step of the catalytic half-reaction. better understanding of this subject might be gained by further
biochemical characterization of e. coli psat and a
structure of its putative closed complex.
correlation of the psat crystal structure to a
published pro®le sequence analysis of all subgroup
iv members indicates a possible conservation of
his41 in the  xxxg1562xxx  gene product where it might have
a catalytic function. until further crystal structures

of subgroup iv members become available the
overall equivalences and distinctions between subgroup iv members and those of subgroups i and ii
remain speculative.

materials and methods
crystallization and heavy atom derivatives
psat was isolated, puri®ed and crystallized as
reported previously (lewendon, 1984; duncan &
coggins, 1986; kallen et al., 1987). crystallization was
performed at 4-7  c by the hanging drop method, using
peg 4000 as a precipitating agent, buffered with sodium
acetate to ph 7.2 in the drop and to ph 5.6 in the reservoir. the ph-gradient was essential for the crystallization. the space group of the psat crystals is p212121.
there is one dimer in the asymmetric unit.
heavy atom derivatives were obtained by soaking
experiments (table 4). one heavy atom derivative was
prepared by iodination, with i2/ki, of tyrosine sidechains. psat crystals were transferred into 5 ml of a stabilizing solution which contained 20 % (w/v) peg 4000
and was buffered with 50 mm sodium acetate to ph 6.0.
a total of 4 ml of 50 mm ki solution in methanol was
added in 1 ml amounts at intervals of a few minutes.
after one hour the solution was treated with 1 ml of
50 mm iodine in methanol. the reaction was allowed to
proceed for 15 hours, after which the crystals were
washed in a stabilizing solution to remove unreacted
iodine ions. for the preparation of two heavy atom
derivatives (methylmercury acetate and i2/ki) glutaraldehyde-crosslinked crystals were used. for this purpose
the psat crystals were soaked for 48 hours in 0.025 %
(w/v) glutaraldehyde in stabilizing solution.
data collection and processing
ê resolution was collected at
a native data set to 2.3 a
4  c on a mar image plate area detector, using a single
crystal. these data were processed with denzo (version
1.6.2) and reduced with scalepack (version 1.6;

structure solution
phases were obtained by the method of multiple isomorphous replacement and anomalous scattering
(miras), incorporating the data of eight heavy atom
derivatives (table 4). heavy atom sites were re®ned and
miras phases calculated using program mlphare
(otwinowski, 1991; collaborative computational project,
1994). a ®rst heavy atom site of a uranyl nitrate derivative was located by inspection of difference pattersons
and used to locate other sites by employing difference
fourier methods. after re®nement of the located heavy
atom sites a ®rst miras phase set was calculated using
ê resolution, resulting in an overall
data up to 3.2 a
®gure-of-merit of 0.51. these phases were improved
using program dm, applying a density modi®cation procedure where solvent ¯ipping was alternated with solvent ¯attening and density histogram matching
(collaborative computational project, 1994; abrahams &
leslie, 1996; cowtan & main, 1996). this procedure converged after four rounds resulting in a ®nal rfree value of
32.8 % (bruènger, 1992). the density modi®ed phases
were used to calculate new difference fourier maps.
more heavy atom sites were located and a new re®nement round followed where the heavy atom sites were
re®ned against the density modi®ed phases. a ®nal
ê
miras phase set was calculated using data up to 3.0 a
resolution, resulting in an overall ®gure-of-merit of 0.60.
these phases were improved in a new round of density
modi®cation where a combination of the following
methods was applied: solvent ¯attening, density histogram matching, skeletonization and 2-fold averaging.
the density modi®cation procedure converged in ®ve
rounds with a ®nal rfree value of 28.8 % and an overall
®gure-of-merit of 0.85. the psat-amg data were
phased employing difference fourier methods and the
atomic model of native psat.
model building and refinement
relevant statistics of re®nement are listed in table 1.
a ®rst model was built in the ®nal density modi®ed
map, which was of excellent quality. rounds of model
building were alternated with rounds of re®nement, utilizing programs o (version 5.10.3) and xplor (versions
3.1 and 3.8), respectively (bruènger et al., 1987; jones et al.,
1991). the ®rst two residues were not included in either
of the models because met1 is not present in the mature
protein (duncan & coggins, 1986) and ala2 is disordered. the side-chains of arg a77, thr a93, asn a117,
val a123 and asn b117 of native psat were found to
have two discrete conformations which were re®ned separately with variable occupancies. in the ®nal re®nement
round these occupancies were ®xed, resulting in a total
summed occupancy for each residue of 1.0. the ®nal
occupancies re®ned to values between 0.4 and 0.6.
a ramachandran plot of the f/c torsion angles of the
polypeptide chain shows good geometry for both models
with none of the protein residues in a generously
allowed or disallowed region, while 91.7 % of the resi-

structure of  xxxg1856xxx 
dues of native psat and 89.2 % of the residues of psatamg are found in the most favoured regions.
the following simulated annealing protocol was
employed in round 1 of the native psat model and
round 2 of the psat-amg model: tinit  4000 k;
tend  300 k; t  0.5 fs; t  ÿ 25 k for every 50 steps
(bruènger et al., 1987). apart from round 3 of the psatamg model (see next section) conventional energy minimization was applied in all remaining re®nement
rounds. the parameters by engh & huber (1991) were
employed. topology and parameter ®les for the cofactor
pyridoxal-50 -phosphate and the ligand a-methyl-l-glutamate were generated using coordinates of small molecule x-ray structures and the program xplo2d
(kleywegt, 1995). all data were included during re®nement with the exception of round 6 of both models,
when only data with fo > 2s(fo) were included. a randomly selected set of re¯ections (5 % of the data) was
used to monitor the rfree, in order to assist decision making during re®nement (bruènger, 1992). bulk solvent corrections were employed during re®nement of both
models (jiang & bruènger, 1994). non-crystallographic
symmetry constraints were applied in round 1 of the
native psat model and in rounds 1 and 3 of the psatamg model. in all other rounds non-crystallographic
symmetry restraints were used. in the last round these
were applied only to ncs related residues with a rmsd
ê (35 of the 362 residues and plp were not
less than 1 a
included), utilizing a weight on positional restraints of
ê 2 and a sncs for b-factor restraints of
100 kcal/mol-a
2
ê
2.5 a . electron density maps (2fo ÿ fc and fo ÿ fc)
were calculated after each re®nement round using phase
information from the re®ned atomic model as suggested
by read (1986). water molecules were selected from electron density peaks with heights exceeding 4s observed
in fo ÿ fc electron density maps. to be accepted they
ê of a protein atom capable
had to be located within 4 a
of forming hydrogen bonds. the ®nal check was performed graphically with program o. the solvent model
was inspected and improved constantly during the
re®nement stage.
temperature factor re®nement was performed utilizing individual atomic b-factors for the native psat
model and grouped b-factors (two per residue) for the
psat-amg model. analysis of the temperature factor
distribution after round 5 indicated that temperature factor re®nement had been insuf®ciently restrained and
resulted in too high b-factors for both models. the overê 2 for the psat model and
all average b-factor was 40.3 a
ê 2 for the psat-amg model. these values deviated
44.7 a
too much from the estimated wilson b-factors (table 1).
the latest version of x-plor (3.851) allows a more
restrained re®nement of the temperature factors. therefore, after round 5 all temperature factors were reset
ê 2 (i.e. the approximate wilson b-factor). an
to 30 a
acceptable temperature factor distribution with acceptable overall average b-factors was thus obtained (table 1).
model building and refinement of bound amg
the ligand amg was ®tted into the electron density
after re®nement round 2 of the psat-amg complex. in
the ®rst two re®nement rounds only protein atoms were
included in the atomic model allowing the generation of
bias-free phases (simulated annealing omit map; hodel
et al., 1992). in re®nement round 3 of the psat-amg
model a rigorous torsion angle re®nement protocol was
performed to check the suspected presence of an external

structure of  xxxg1856xxx 
aldimine adduct with amg in subunit a (rice &
bruènger, 1994). before starting this re®nement protocol
several test runs were performed to determine the most
optimal re®nement conditions using rfree as a means of
cross-validation: non-crystallographic symmetry constraints were applied to achieve an optimal observation
to parameter ratio; two alternative conformations of
amg were re®ned in order to model the assumed different binding modes in subunits a and b (amg was modeled as a free ligand in both alternative conformations);
the x-plor ``constraints-interaction-statement'' was
used to prevent plp, lys198 and the two alternative conformations of amg from having any interaction with
each other (i.e. they could not ``see each other''); one
temperature factor per residue and one occupancy per
alternative conformation of amg were re®ned; solvent
molecules were not included. by setting up the re®nement in this way maximal freedom for the amg ligand
and the plp molecule was achieved so that in combination with the powerful torsion angle re®nement algorithm the conformational space could be sampled in an
optimal manner. the applied torsion angle re®nement
protocol was as follows: ®rst optimization of the geometry by energy minization while excluding the x-ray
energy term; a 2 ps (t  0.002 ps) constant temperature
(2500 k) torsion angle re®nement run followed; a short
quenching molecular dynamics run at 300 k was subsequently performed (200 steps, t  0.5 fs); ®nally
energy minimization was carried out. this protocol was
immediately followed by a simulated annealing slow
cooling protocol as described above (tinit was in this case
3000 k). finally energy minimization and temperature
factor re®nement were done. after re®nement the occupancy and mean temperature factors of the two alternative amg conformations in the two otherwise
ê 2, and 0.53
constrained subunits were 0.47 and 37.9 a
ê 2, respectively. the ®rst conformation correand 50.7 a
sponded to the external aldimine with amg (subunit a),
the second to the internal aldimine with lys198 (subunit
b). here amg was too far away for covalent binding.
the equal occupancies, corresponding to 100 % external
aldimine in subunit a and 100 % internal aldimine in
subunit b were a satisfactory result.
