abstract
conclusion. the high density of [3h]- xxxd2995xxx  binding sites on the local leukocytes in human nasal mucosa suggests that
 xxxg599xxx  receptor antagonists may directly modulate cellular function of the local leukocytes through binding to  xxxg599xxx 
receptor on allergic nasal mucosa. objectives. the cysteinyl leukotrienes (cyslts) are lipid mediators that have been
implicated in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. pharmacological studies using cyslts indicate that two classes of
receptors named  xxxg599xxx  and cyslt2 receptor exist. the former is sensitive to the  xxxg599xxx  receptor antagonist currently
used to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis. to confirm the binding sites of  xxxg599xxx  receptor antagonist in human nasal
mucosa, the autoradiographic distribution of  xxxg599xxx  receptor was studied in human nasal inferior turbinates. materials
and methods. cryostat sections were incubated with [3h]- xxxd2995xxx  for autoradiography. nonspecific binding was
determined by adding unlabelled  xxxd2995xxx . results. autoradiograms indicated [3h]- xxxd2995xxx  densely labeled on the
interstitial cells. blood vessels were sparsely labeled. there was no specific labeling in the submucosal glands or epithelium.
these results support our previous report from in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry of  xxxg599xxx  receptor.

introduction
cysteinyl leukotriene (cyslt) plays an important
role in allergic rhinitis, because cyslt receptor
antagonist,  xxxd2995xxx  [1], montelukast [2] and
 xxxd3545xxx  [3] relieved the symptoms of allergic
rhinitis. pharmacological studies using cyslts indicate that at least two classes of receptors, named
 xxxg599xxx  and cyslt2, exist. recent cloning of the
human  xxxg599xxx  [4,5] and cyslt2 [6,7] receptor
genes allows an approach to study the gene expression of cyslt receptors in nasal mucosa. our
previous immunohistochemical study showed that
anti- xxxg599xxx  receptor antibody labeled eosinophils,
mast cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and vascular
endothelial cells in human nasal mucosa [8].
these data suggest that in allergic rhinitis, the
major target of  xxxg599xxx  receptor antagonists are the
vascular bed and the infiltrated leukocytes such as
mast cells, eosinophils, and macrophages. however,
as yet no other careful analysis of  xxxg599xxx  receptor

localization in the nasal mucosa has been reported.
in this study,  xxxg599xxx  receptors in human inferior
turbinate have been characterized and localized with
[3h] xxxd2995xxx .
materials and methods
tissue preparation
human turbinates were obtained after turbinectomy
from four patients with nasal obstruction that was
refractory to medical therapy. informed consent was
obtained from all patients and this study was
approved by the ethics committee of the sapporo
medical university. donors ranged in age from 22 to
53 years: two male and two female. all were
nonsmokers, and all patients had perennial allergy
against mite as defined by history and cap-rast.
all medications, including antibiotics, were prohibited for at least 3 weeks prior to the study. no patient
had been taking  xxxg599xxx  receptor antagonists. the

binding sites for  xxxg599xxx  receptor antagonist in human nasal mucosa 949
nasal mucosal specimens were dissected from the
cartilage, and frozen in oct compound (sakura
finetechnical co., tokyo, japan) for radioligandbinding assay and autoradiography and then stored
at 708c until use.
pharmacologic agents
[3h]-labeled  xxxd2995xxx  (specific activity, 25.4
ci/mmol) and unlabelled  xxxd2995xxx  were provided
by ono-pharmaceutical co. (osaka, japan).
cryostat sections
cryostat sections (6 mm) were cut, thawed, and
mounted on aminopropyl silane (aps)-coated slides
(matsunami glass ind. ltd, osaka, japan). slides
were stored at /708c.
autoradiography
slides were warmed to room temperature, washed in
incubation buffer (50 mm tris hcl ph 7.4, 48c)
containing 5 mm cacl2 and 0.2% bsa, and
incubated with 2 nm [3h]- xxxd2995xxx  (25.4
ci/mmol) in buffer for 60 min at 48c. nonspecific
binding was determined by incubating adjacent
sections under the same conditions in the presence

of  xxxd2995xxx  (2 mm). after incubation, the slides
were washed twice for 5 min in ice-cold buffer
(50 mm tris hcl, ph 7.4, 48c), rinsed in cold
distilled water, and then rapidly dried in a stream of
cold air. in the dark room, slides were dipped in
nuclear track emulsion (lm-1, amersham pharmacia biotech), and the slides were placed vertically for
2 h to allow the emulsion to run off in an even
fashion and dry. coated slides were placed in plastic
boxes, and the sections were exposed for 24 weeks
at 48c and warmed to room temperature in the dark.
slides were then developed in d-19 developer (eastman kodak co., rochester, ny, usa) for 1 min at
228c, washed in water for 30 s, fixed in kodak fixes
for 4 min, and finally washed in water for 15 min.
slides were counterstained with fuchsin-methylene
blue, and coverslips were placed permanently in
apposition with mounting medium (entellan new,
merk, darmstadt, germany).
estimation of [3h]- xxxd2995xxx  binding was
performed by wiping off tissue sections from
microscope slides. after solubilization (ncs solubilizer, amersham international, buckinghamshire,
uk) and addition of 10 ml of scintillant (acs,
amersham international), counting was performed
in a liquid scintillation analyzer (beckman
ls-6000sc, beckman coulter inc., fullerton, ca,
usa).

results
autoradiography
autoradiograms of the human nasal mucosa demonstrated that [3h] xxxd2995xxx  binding sites were distributed with dense labeling on the interstitial cells
and with sparse labeling on vessels, including arterioles, veins, and sinusoids (figure 1b and 2b). the
addition of excess cold  xxxd2995xxx  completely displaced binding to these sites (figure 1d and 2d). in
contrast, there was no specific labeling either on the
epithelium or submucosal glands (figure 1b).
to quantitatively assess the degree of specific
binding, we estimated the amount of binding to
nasal specimens by counting tritium levels. counts
of [3h]- xxxd2995xxx  showed a significant degree of
specific [3h]- xxxd2995xxx  binding to nasal mucosa
(figure 3).

figure 3. analysis of [3h]- xxxd2995xxx  binding to human inferior
turbinates. nasal tissue sections were incubated with [3h] xxxd2995xxx  (0.2 and 2 nm) for 60 min at 48c in a final volume
of 100 ml. nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of
an excess of unlabelled  xxxd2995xxx  (2 mm). specific binding was
determined in triplicate by subtracting nonspecific binding (solid
triangles) from total binding (solid circles). each point represents
the mean 9/ standard deviation (n /4).

discussion
autoradiographic studies for respiratory tract have
localized [3h] ltc4 binding sites to alveolar walls,
bronchiolar smooth muscle, and tracheal smooth
muscle in guinea pig lung [9], and to the smooth
muscle region of septa in bullfrog lung [10].
although  xxxg599xxx  receptor antagonists have already
been in clinical use, there had been no report
indicating the binding sites of cyslts or cyslt

antagonist to mammalian airway tissues. in our
preliminary study, we could not confirm the specific
binding sites of [3h] ltd4 to nasal mucosa
from allergic rhinitis patients. because antagonist
binding has considerable advantages as a result of
invariable affinity for receptors, we have explored the
use of a radiolabeled  xxxg599xxx  receptor antagonist,
 xxxd2995xxx .

binding sites for  xxxg599xxx  receptor antagonist in human nasal mucosa 951
in the present study, autoradiography revealed
that the specific binding sites of  xxxg599xxx  receptor
antagonist were vascular endothelium and interstitial
cells in human nasal mucosa, which supported our
previous data from in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry for  xxxg599xxx  receptor [8].
in vivo,  xxxg599xxx  receptor antagonists can modulate airway inflammation in that they can effectively
reduce eosinophil chemotaxis [11], peripheral blood
eosinophil counts [12], and monocyte/macrophage
influx [13]. in addition, it has been shown that
human cord blood-derived mast cells express the
 xxxg599xxx  receptor [14]. the expression of the
 xxxg599xxx  receptor on monocytes, eosinophils, and
mast cells, all of which are cell types capable of
synthesizing cyslts, suggests that autocrine and
paracrine activation may occur after stimulation by
the appropriate inflammatory signal [15]. such a
positive feedback mechanism may in part involve the
exacerbations of allergic rhinitis.
another subtype of cyslt receptor has been
reported to be cyslt2 receptor, and its
selective antagonist has not been reported yet.
development of new selective cyslt2 receptor
antagonist will provide useful information for
cyslt2 receptor-mediated diseases.
in conclusion, our results demonstrate that a novel
radioactive  xxxg599xxx  receptor antagonist, [3h]- xxxd2995xxx , binds specifically to  xxxg599xxx  receptors in
human inferior turbinate and its binding sites are
localized to vascular endothelium and the interstitial
cells. [3h]- xxxd2995xxx  may be a useful radioligand for
studying the pathophysiological roles and regulation
of expression of  xxxg599xxx  receptor in nasal mucosa
and other tissues.
