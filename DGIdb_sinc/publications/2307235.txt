1. introduction

our earlier studies demonstrated that the incubation
of  xxxg63xxx  with rat liver microsomes and nadph or

since the discovery of the first nonsteroidal antiestrogen [l], numerous studies have been conducted to
determine the mechanism of action of this class of compounds. however, despite extensive efforts in many
laboratories, there is currently no mech~ism which
adequately explains both the agonistic and antagonistic
actions of the triphenylethylene
compounds
[2].
moreover,
the pronounced
differences in activity
elicited by tamoxifen in a variety of animal species are
puzzling; tamoxifen is a pure estrogen agonist in the
mouse uterus, a partial agonist/antagonist
in the rat
uterus and a pure antagonist in the chick oviduct [3-61.
recently it was observed that chlorotri~isene
( xxxg63xxx ),
a long-acting triphenylethylene estrogen, exhibits antiestrogenic activity [7]. these findings indicate that
triphenylethylene derivatives generally share similarity
of action and that the differences, such as between
tamoxifen and  xxxg63xxx , are merely quantitative. in view
of such findings, it is difficult to envision a unified
mechanism of action for triphenylethylenes
across
animal species, based solely on the reversible binding to
the  xxxg730xxx  (er) or to the antiestrogen
binding site [ 17,261. therefore we embarked on a study
of alternative mechanisms for antiestrogen action.

with a reconstituted p-450 monooxygen~e produces a
reactive intermediate (t*), which binds covalently to
proteins [12,13]. t* exhibits considerable stability, suggesting that t* might survive in transport. hence, it appeared conceivable that in the course of incubation of
 xxxg63xxx  with liver microsomes and nadph and uteri,
t* would react with uterine proteins, possibly with the
er. the current study supports this supposition. the
incubation of  xxxg63xxx  with rat liver microsomes in the
presence of nadph and immature rat uteri, under
conditions which generate t*, causes a pronounced
decrease in the estrogen-binding sites in the uterine er
(assayed by exchange with ]3h]estradiol (f3h]e&. our
studies suggest that t* reacts readily with compounds
containing free sulfhydryl groups [12]. hence, we
speculate that the decrease in ez binding to the er is
due to the reaction of t* with cysteines at the estrogen
binding site of er [14,18]. the possibility that other
antiestrogenic triphenylethylenes function by a similar
mechanism, is discussed.

tomized and used 5-7 days later [16]. briefly, rats were injected with
the compounds and 6 h later the uteri were removed; individual uteri
were homogenized and 20 oogg supernate (half uterus equivalent)
was incubated with [i-r4c]ornithine for 1 h. the reaction was terminated with 1 m citrate and the r4coz was trapped on filter paper
strip containing 50 ~1 of ncs and quantitated by scintillation spectrometry.
2.1. method to determine whether a compound is a proestrogen/
proantiestrogen
the procedure, previously described by us [lo,ll], employs in the
same vessel a metabolizing system (rat liver microsomes and
nadph) and an estrogen detecting system (rat uteri). a compound
is considered to be a proestrogen/proantiestrogen
if it requires
metabolism (nadph and active microsomes) to elevate the uterine
 xxxg730xxx  (br) in the nuclei (er.) and decrease the cytosolic
er (er,). by contrast, a compound is considered to be active per se
if such distribution of uterine er occurs without metabolism
(absence of nadph or presence of heat-inactivated microsomes).
each incubation contained 3 ml krebs-ringer solution (krs), about
0.5 mg liver microsomal protein and halves of 6 uteri (sliced through
the apex) and the test compound added in 5 pl ethanol; the control,
lacking nadph or containing heat-inactivated liver microsomes and
nadph, had the parallel halves of the same uteri. prior to incubation, oxygen is bubbled vigorously through the septum into the entire
mixture for 2-3 min, to preserve receptor stability [29]. the reaction
is started by injecting 0.3 mg nadph in 0.3 ml krs through the
septem (controls receive 0.3 ml krs). incubation is conducted for 1
h at 37°c with shaking. the uteri are washed, homogenized and the
nuclei and 20000 g supernate are prepared. quantitation of the
 xxxg730xxx  in the nuclei (erj and in the cytosol (er,) was
achieved by an exchange with [‘h]ez [10,11,27].

3. results and discussion
it has been suggested that the triphenylethylenes
tamoxifen
and  xxxg63xxx  are prodrugs
[2,8,9]. we
substantiated this for  xxxg63xxx . in vivo,  xxxg63xxx  elicits
estrogenic activity, elevating uterine weight and odc
(table 1). similar estrogenic activity was observed with
the antiestrogen-tamoxifen
and with the estrogendes. however, in vitro,  xxxg63xxx  did not inhibit the
binding of [3h]e~ to the er (not shown). others also
observed an extremely low binding affinity of  xxxg63xxx 
for er, [28]. this indicates that  xxxg63xxx  is a proestrogen. nevertheless,  xxxg63xxx  exhibits some ‘estrogenie’ effect on the er in vitro, causing a moderate
increase in the er, (table 2); a similar effect was

observed with tamoxifen. these effects were relatively
small as compared with ez and des [lo]. it is unlikely
that  xxxg63xxx  and tamoxifen are metabolized by uterine
monoxygenases into estrogens. rat uteri do not exhibit
significant 0-demethylating
activity [ 10,l l] and, by
contrast to mouse uteri [19], do not catalyze a certain
aromatic hydroxylation [20]. consequently,  xxxg63xxx  and
tamoxifen probably have weak estrogenic effects on the
er.
 xxxg63xxx  undergoes demethylation by rat liver microsomal monooxygenase
to phenolic products [21].
hence, we anticipated that the incubation of  xxxg63xxx 
with liver microsomes will produce demethylated
estrogenic metabolites which would markedly increase
uterine ern. however, it also seemed conceivable that
the reactive intermediate of  xxxg63xxx  (t*) [12,13] will
bind covalently to the uterine er, possibly at the
estrogen binding site. in fact, when  xxxg63xxx  was incubated with liver microsomes and nadph in the
presence of uteri (table 3), there was no increase in er,
but instead there was a pronounced decrease in total
uterine er, (er, (er, plus ern)). there was no
decrease in ert when nadph was deleted or when
heat-inactivated liver microsomes were used. furthermore, there was a more pronounced decrease in ert
with increased concentration of  xxxg63xxx  (fig.1). these
findings indicated that  xxxg63xxx  metabolism was required
for eliciting the diminished uterine ert. further studies

on whether the diminished ert reflects a preferential
decrease in er, or er, might yield information or er
trafficking.
the pesticide  xxxd2143xxx  is metabolized by liver
microsomes into demethylated estrogenic products
[ io,1 1,311. we previously observed that  xxxd2143xxx ,
like  xxxg63xxx , can be metabolically activated to bind
covalently to proteins [22,23]. however, by contrast to
 xxxg63xxx  [ 1.31,the reactive intermediate of  xxxd2143xxx 
(m*) did not bind to the exogenously added albumin
(unpublished result). therefore, m* was not expected
to react with distant sites, such as uterine er. in fact,
the microsomal metabolism of  xxxd2143xxx  increased
er, and decreased er, without diminishing ert
[lo,l i] (table 4). similarly mdde, and in vivo metabolite of  xxxd2143xxx , did not affect ert. thus we
concluded that whereas t* could inactivate er, m*
could not. also this demonstrated that er inactivation
was not due to formation of other factors, unrelated to
 xxxg63xxx  metabolism.
the decrease of ert during the generation of t* was
shown by the diminished binding of [3h] ez in the exchange assay. the possibility that  xxxg63xxx  is metabolized

to a product with much higher affinity for the er than
ez and thus interferes with the exchange of [3hje~ is
unlikely: (i) where unable to isolate such a metabolite
from incubations of  xxxg63xxx  with liver microsomes and
(ii> increasing the concentration of [3h]e~ 5-fold and
stripping the uterine cytosol with charcoa1 prior to the
exchange assay did not alter the results (not shown).
currently, we have no information on whether the
steroid-binding site is masked by t* or merely has
become altered. our previous studies suggest that t*
binds to the cysteine sulfhydryl in proteins ([ 121and unpublished data), cysteine is present at the steroid-and
dna-binding sites of the er ]14,18). therefore it is
possible that t* binds to the cysteines of the er and interferes with e2 binding. an alternate, albeit less likely,
interpretation of these results is that the metabolism of
 xxxg63xxx  has diminished the receptor level, by increasing
its processing or by altering its structure possibly
through a non-covalent binding mechanism. nakao et
al. [24] observed that the administration of tamoxifen
to rats causes a dramatic decrease in uterine cytosolic
estrogen-binding sites and elicits a modified ‘receptor’.
this tempts a speculation that tamoxifen binds covalently to the receptor in vivo. our preliminary
findings that tamoxifen undergoes metabolic activation
by rat liver microsomes, resulting in covalent binding to
protein (not shown), supports such a possibility.
previously, we demonstrated that the pretreatment of
ovariectomized rats with tamoxifen abolishes the induction of odc by a subsequent treatment with ez
[zs]. thus, it is conceivable that this desensitjzation
might occur by a tamoxifen mediated inactivation of
the er. whether  xxxg63xxx  also could cause a desensitization of odc induction, is not known.
in conclusion, the current studies suggest a novel
mechanism to explain the agonistic and antagonistic activity of triphenylethylenes. we propose that the two
effects are the resultant of the reversible binding of
estrogenic metabolites and of the reactive intermediate
{rx). the dramatic species differences in response to
tamoxifen could be due to qualitative or quantitative
differences in ri formation, possibly because of species
differences in p-450 isoforms, or due to species differences in quenching the ri. it would be of particular
interest to determine whether the irreversible binding
causes a partial or complete inactivation of the receptor. alternatively, it is possible that the covalent binding of  xxxg63xxx  merely yields a persistently activated,
albeit altered receptor, a mechanism proposed for the
reaction of 1(itu-hydroxyestrone [30]. the examination
of these possibilities would require extensive investigations.
