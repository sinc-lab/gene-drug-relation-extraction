introduction: increasing population age, obesity and physical inactivity mean
that type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) is increasingly common. current treatments may be limited by adverse events, drug--drug interactions or contraindication/need for dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment.
areas covered: this paper reviews studies that evaluate the pharmacokinetics,
pharmacodynamics and clinical efficacy and safety of  xxxd2487xxx , a dipeptidyl
peptidase-4 (dpp-4) inhibitor, recently approved in the us, japan and europe
for the treatment of t2dm.
expert opinion: oral  xxxd2487xxx , 5 mg once daily, is an effective, welltolerated dpp-4 inhibitor, suitable for use in a wide range of patients with
t2dm. it is weight-neutral, without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia, and
can be administered either alone or in combination with other diabetes treatments. it has a unique pharmacological profile within its class and, unlike
other dpp-4 inhibitors,  xxxd2487xxx  does not require dose adjustment in
patients with renal impairment.

introduction

type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) remains an important disease worldwide, with a
global prevalence that was estimated to be 6.4% in 2010 [1]. this is expected to
rise to 8% by 2030 as a result of increasing population age, physical inactivity,
overweight and obesity [2,3].
overall treatment goals for patients with t2dm are to achieve and maintain
glycemic control, and control of other factors including hypertension and hyperlipidemia, with the aim of reducing morbidity and mortality associated with the disease.
initial therapy with metformin is recommended by the treatment guidelines of
several international scientific bodies, including the american diabetes association,
the american association of clinical endocrinologists, the international diabetes
federation and the european association for the study of diabetes [4-7]. treatment
targets generally recommended by these guidelines are for glycated hemoglobin
(hba1c) < 7% [4] or £ 6.5% [5,7]. in special patient populations, hba1c treatment
goals might be modified according to the individual risk constellation [5]. however,
a high proportion of patients with t2dm fail to attain these target levels for
hba1c [8-10]. treatment intensification is recommended, when initial therapy
fails, with an antihyperglycemic drug that has a different mechanism of
action from the initial therapy. recommended second-line therapies include

dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (dpp-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (glp-1) agonists, sulfonylureas, glinides, thiazolidinediones, a-glucosidase inhibitors and insulin alone or in
combination [4,6,7].
although blood glucose control is an integral part of the
treatment of t2dm, recent studies investigating the effect
of glucose-lowering treatments on cardiovascular outcome in
patients with t2dm did not report positive results [11-13].
thus, new drugs for the treatment of t2dm should be evaluated for their overall effects on the cardiovascular risk profile
instead of merely focusing on their effects on blood glucose
levels. treatment of t2dm should provide optimized blood
glucose control and the preservation of beta cell function,
without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia or weight gain.
difficulties in maintaining long-term glycemic control with
current therapies have led to the need for new treatments
that can be used either as monotherapy or combined with
102

existing treatments. unmet needs remain with existing therapies for t2dm, including availability of oral antidiabetic
agents that are suitable for a wide range of patients (such as
those at risk of declining renal function, a frequent complication of t2dm) and that exhibit limited drug--drug interactions (including agents used for common concomitant
conditions such as hypertension, dyslipidemia or cardiovascular disease) or treatments for diabetic complications (such as
nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy).
the recognition that the incretin system plays a pivotal role
in the control of blood glucose levels and that impairments in
the incretin response, particularly the activity of glp-1, are
present in t2dm [14-16], has led to the development of a
new family of therapeutic agents [17]. glp-1 stimulates insulin secretion and inhibits glucagon secretion in a glucosedependent manner, so its effects decline as glucose levels
reach < 90 mg/dl [18,19]. glp-1 also exhibits additional effects

that can improve glucose homeostasis and encourage weight
loss, through the inhibition of gastric emptying and reduction
of appetite [18]. an incretin-based approach to reducing
hyperglycemia is potentially superior to conventional insulinotropic agents that often act independently of glucose levels.
the ubiquitous enzyme dpp-4 rapidly degrades
glp-1 [20], and inhibition of this enzyme has been shown to
double endogenous levels of glp-1 [21]. the inhibition of
glucagon secretion might be of particular importance because
glucagon is a main determinant of glucose production from
the liver, and t2dm is associated with hyperglucagonemia
and a defective suppression of glucagon secretion by glucose.
the inhibitory effect of glp-1 on glucagon secretion seems
to be a particularly important mechanism in the control of
postprandial increases in blood glucose levels. in addition,
glp-1 has been shown to exert trophic effects on pancreatic
b-cell mass. while improvements in b-cell mass have been
shown in animal studies and in vitro studies with human
b cells to date [22,23], there is also increasing evidence of clinical improvements in b-cell function in humans [24]. finally,
the importance of glp-1 extends to non-metabolic effects,
including cardioprotective and vasodilatory actions that
improve endothelial function, myocardial function and
blood pressure, and decreases postprandial triglyceride and
nonesterified fatty acid levels [25-27].

body of review

overview of the market
the main unmet need in the management of t2dm is the
achievement of optimal glycemic control without increasing
the risk of hypoglycemia or weight gain, and to reduce the
overall risk for the development of vascular complications.
in addition, an ideal treatment for t2dm would be effective
and well tolerated in a wide range of patients. current treatments for t2dm can broadly be divided into oral or subcutaneous agents, all of which have not only particular advantages
but also some limitations (table 1) [5,31-35].
2.1

introduction to the compound
 xxxd2487xxx  is a dpp-4 inhibitor for the treatment of
t2dm [24,29,36]. it has a unique pharmacokinetic profile
within the dpp-4 inhibitor class [37-40].
2.2

chemistry
 xxxd2487xxx  ( xxxd2487xxx ), 8-[(3r)-3-aminopiperidin-1-yl]-7(but-2-yn-1-yl)-3-methyl-1-[(4-methylquinazolin-2-yl)methyl]3,7-dihydro-1h-purine-2,6-dione, is a xanthine-derived
dpp-4 inhibitor [41].  xxxd2487xxx  is a competitive, reversible
2.3

inhibitor of dpp-4 with a slow rate of dissociation from its
substrate [40]. it has a 40,000-fold selectivity for dpp-4 compared with dpp-8, and a > 10,000-fold selectivity for
dpp-4 compared with dpp-9, and has low levels of interaction with other proteases. these features are consistent with
the tolerability and wide therapeutic window of  xxxd2487xxx 
observed during its pharmacological evaluation [42]. furthermore,  xxxd2487xxx  is not a significant inhibitor of cyp450
enzymes, suggesting a very low possibility of interaction
between  xxxd2487xxx  and drugs that are metabolized by these
enzymes [43].
pharmacodynamics
within the class of dpp-4 inhibitors,  xxxd2487xxx  has a unique
pharmacodynamic profile [42].  xxxd2487xxx  has been shown to
inhibit dpp-4 more effectively than other agents in its class,
with an ic50 of ~ 1 nm, compared with 19 nm for sitagliptin,
50 nm for  xxxd3176xxx  and 62 nm for  xxxd3510xxx  [40]. in
human studies, dpp-4 inhibition by  xxxd2487xxx  was shown to
occur at clinically relevant levels. in healthy male volunteers,
single  xxxd2487xxx  doses of 2.5 and 5 mg reduced dpp-4 activity
by 72.7 and 86.1% from baseline, respectively [42]. this has
also been demonstrated clinically: in male patients with
t2dm, dpp-4 inhibition was shown to be > 90% with
once-daily  xxxd2487xxx  at 5 and 10 mg doses [39].
2.4

pharmacokinetics and metabolism
compared with other dpp-4 inhibitors,  xxxd2487xxx  has a
unique pharmacokinetic profile (table 2) [42,44]. in contrast
to other dpp-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin,  xxxd3510xxx  and
 xxxd3176xxx ),  xxxd2487xxx  binds extensively to plasma proteins
in a concentration-dependent manner [45]. the high-affinity
binding of  xxxd2487xxx  to dpp-4 in the plasma and tissues produces a long terminal half-life and a nonlinear pharmacokinetic profile. this has been demonstrated in both animal
models [38,45,46] and humans [39]. as a result,  xxxd2487xxx 
exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics, unlike other dpp-4
inhibitors, with a less-than dose-proportional increase in
exposure in the therapeutic dose range, reflecting the saturable
binding of  xxxd2487xxx  to the target dpp-4 enzyme [39,42]. the
main metabolite of  xxxd2487xxx  (cd 1790) is pharmacologically inactive, indicating that metabolism does not have a
major influence on the disposition and elimination of  xxxd2487xxx  [47]. some minor metabolites of  xxxd2487xxx  are formed
by glucuronidation, a process that is increased in individuals
with hepatic insufficiency [47]. therefore, subjects with
hepatic insufficiency would not be at risk of accumulation
of these minor metabolites, and no dose adjustment is
required for patients with hepatic impairment [36].
key pharmacokinetic parameters of  xxxd2487xxx  are a halflife (t1/2) of 131 h, a maximum concentration (cmax) of
8.32 nmol/l, a time to maximum concentration (tmax) of
1.75 h and an area under the plasma concentration--time
curve (0--24 h, auc0--24) of 118 nmol.h/l [42]. after
once-daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of

 xxxd2487xxx  5 mg are achieved by the third dose [36,48]. the
long terminal half-life of  xxxd2487xxx  leads to sustained inhibition of dpp-4 activity [39] and supports once-daily dosing [42].
the prolonged elimination phase does not contribute to the
accumulation of  xxxd2487xxx , and the effective half-life for
accumulation of the drug, as determined from oral administration of multiple doses of  xxxd2487xxx  5 mg, is approximately
12 h [36]. in addition,  xxxd2487xxx  has oral bioavailability of
approximately 30% in healthy subjects [49].
104

a further clinically important difference between  xxxd2487xxx  and other dpp-4 inhibitors is its largely non-renal route
of elimination: 85% hepatic versus 5% renal [42,47]. a study
of the effects of various degrees of renal impairment on the
exposure of  xxxd2487xxx  has shown that dose adjustment is
not required in patients with declining renal function [48].
the findings showed that renal excretion of  xxxd2487xxx 
remained below 7% regardless of the degree of renal
impairment and that other pharmacokinetic parameters were

expert opin. pharmacother. (2012) 13(1)

forst & pfützner

not significantly influenced by renal function, and only a
weak correlation (r2 = 0.18) was seen between creatinine
clearance and steady-state exposure. by contrast, other
dpp-4 inhibitors undergo renal elimination and generally
require dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment
(table 2) [44].
clinical efficacy
 xxxd2487xxx  has been extensively evaluated, and the clinical
trial program includes more than 4000 patients from more
than 40 countries worldwide, many of whom demonstrate
various degrees of declining renal function [50]. in these clinical trials,  xxxd2487xxx  5 mg once daily was shown to provide
significant and clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control, significantly reducing hba1c, fasting plasma
glucose (fpg) and postprandial glucose (ppg) levels from
baseline compared with placebo. in common with other
dpp-4 inhibitors,  xxxd2487xxx  has a more pronounced effect
on fpg than ppg.  xxxd2487xxx  5 mg once daily is indicated
as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control
in adults with t2dm. [29,51],
four pivotal phase iii trials have evaluated  xxxd2487xxx 
monotherapy [24],  xxxd2487xxx  as add-on to metformin [29], as
add-on to metformin plus a sulfonylurea [30] and as initial
combination with pioglitazone [28]. the aim of these four,
24-week, international, randomized, double-blind studies
was to assess the efficacy and safety profile of  xxxd2487xxx 
(5 mg, once daily) versus placebo in patients with t2dm
who were failing to achieve glycemic control [36].
in the 24-week monotherapy trial (n = 503),  xxxd2487xxx  was
associated with a statistically significant placebo-corrected
reduction from mean baseline hba1c of 0.69% versus placebo. the greatest placebo-adjusted reduction in hba1c
(1.01%, p < 0.0001) was seen in patients with baseline
hba1c ‡ 9%. there was also a reduction in mean fpg
of 1.3 mmol/l versus placebo, while the adjusted mean reduction from baseline ppg was 3.2 mmol/l versus placebo
(p < 0.0001 for all comparisons) [24]. the findings of a further
study indicate that the beneficial effects of  xxxd2487xxx  can be
achieved after as little as 4 weeks of treatment. in a 28-day
study of  xxxd2487xxx  monotherapy (n = 77), placebocorrected mean reductions in hba1c of 0.31, 0.37 and
0.28% were observed with  xxxd2487xxx  doses of 2.5, 5 and
10 mg, respectively [52]. statistically significant reductions in
adjusted mean fpg and ppg were also observed for all
 xxxd2487xxx  doses (p < 0.025).
in a 24-week study of  xxxd2487xxx  as add-on therapy to metformin (n = 701), a placebo-corrected reduction in hba1c
from baseline of 0.64% was observed with  xxxd2487xxx  versus
placebo, with adjusted mean reductions in fpg of
1.2 mmol/l versus placebo, and reductions in ppg levels of
3.7 mmol/l versus placebo (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons) [29]. in a further 12-week study of  xxxd2487xxx  added to
ongoing metformin therapy (n = 333),  xxxd2487xxx  (5 mg,
once daily) was significantly more effective than placebo and

2.6

more effective than either  xxxd2487xxx  1 or 10 mg doses [53].
the mean placebo-corrected reductions in hba1c at week
12 were 0.40% for  xxxd2487xxx  1 mg (p = 0.006), 0.73% for
 xxxd2487xxx  5 mg (p < 0.001) and 0.67% for  xxxd2487xxx 
10 mg (p < 0.001); mean placebo-corrected fpg reductions
for  xxxd2487xxx  were 1.1 mmol/l (p = 0.0020) for 1 mg,
1.9 mmol/l (p < 0.0001) for 5 mg and 1.6 mmol/l
(p < 0.0001) for 10 mg.
in a 24-week study of  xxxd2487xxx  added to existing treatment with metformin plus sulfonylurea in patients with
t2dm (n = 1058), similar findings were observed: the
addition of  xxxd2487xxx  produced a statistically significant
placebo-corrected reduction in baseline hba1c of 0.62%
versus placebo and an adjusted mean reduction in fpg of
0.7 mmol/l versus placebo (p < 0.0001 for both). a total
of 29.2% of patients receiving  xxxd2487xxx  reached the
hba1c goal of < 7%, compared with 8.1% for placebo
(p < 0.0001) [30] this finding was achieved despite the presence of long-standing t2dm in the majority of subjects
(73%), and the presence of macrovascular disease in around
80% of study participants. in this study, symptomatic hypoglycemia was more common in the active treatment group
than with placebo (16.7 vs 10.5%, respectively) and is consistent with the increased frequency that has been previously
observed with dpp-4 inhibitors when used in combination
with sulfonylureas [54].
 xxxd2487xxx  has also been shown to be effective in combination with pioglitazone over 24 weeks (n = 389), where the
addition of  xxxd2487xxx  produced a reduction in adjusted
mean hba1c from baseline of 0.51% versus placebo
(p < 0.001), and a reduction in fpg of 0.8 mmol/l compared
with placebo (p < 0.001). a total of 42.9% of patients
receiving  xxxd2487xxx  reached the hba1c goal of < 7% with
 xxxd2487xxx  compared with 30.5% in the placebo group
(p = 0.005) [28].
with respect to other biomarkers of efficacy,  xxxd2487xxx  at
doses ranging between 2.5 and 10 mg has been shown to
increase glp-1 levels after 28 days; adjusted mean plasma
glp-1 concentrations ranged from 7.3 to 13.9 pmol/l for
the  xxxd2487xxx  doses compared with 5.1 pmol/l for placebo [52]. in clinical studies,  xxxd2487xxx  significantly improved
surrogate markers of b-cell function as assessed by the
homeostasis model (homa-b) of b-cell function [29], the
 xxxg1193xxx /insulin ratio (elevated ratios indicate abnormal
b-cell function) and the disposition index (a marker of insulin
sensitivity (insulin secretion/insulin resistance))[24,30] . these
changes are consistent with improved b-cell function in
t2dm. similar results have been reported with other
dpp-4 inhibitors [55-57].
the cardiovascular safety of  xxxd2487xxx  5 mg once daily is
under investigation in the long-term head-to-head, eventdriven, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, active comparator ( xxxd2203xxx ) study, carolina (cardiovascular

designed to evaluate cardiovascular outcomes in 6000 patients
with t2dm who are either treatment naive or on other antidiabetic therapies (sulfonylureas, glinides or a-glucosidase
inhibitors). the carolina study will be the first head-tohead cardiovascular outcome trial of a dpp-4 inhibitor versus
an active comparator that is powered to demonstrate differences in cardiovascular events and to provide clinically relevant
cardiovascular data on  xxxd2487xxx  compared with  xxxd2203xxx 
in patients with t2dm. the trial is scheduled to complete
in 2018 and will provide important new data on the
cardiovascular safety of therapies for t2dm.
safety and tolerability
 xxxd2487xxx  is generally well tolerated by patients with
t2dm. the incidences of adverse events, serious adverse
events and episodes of hypoglycemia are similar to those of
placebo [24,28-30,53]. data from the clinical trial program also
demonstrate that  xxxd2487xxx  is weight-neutral [24,29,30]. in theory,  xxxd2487xxx  therapy may cause plasma  xxxd3472xxx  levels to
rise, as a result of indirectly increasing insulin secretion. however, no cases of drug-induced hyperuricemia have been
reported. in the clinical trial program, pancreatitis was
reported in 8 of 4687 patients (4311 patient years of
exposure) treated with  xxxd2487xxx , compared with 0 of
1183 patients (433 patient years of exposure) treated with placebo. three additional cases of pancreatitis were reported
following the last administered dose. however, no link
between  xxxd2487xxx  and pancreatitis has been identified.
as a class, dpp-4 inhibitors are not considered to be
inducers or inhibitors of the cyp450 system, although  xxxd3176xxx  is a cyp3a4/5 substrate [44]. generally, only mild
drug--drug interactions have been reported between dpp-4
inhibitors and other glucose-lowering agents; other agents
likely to be coadministered to patients with t2dm (e.g., statins, antihypertensive agents); compounds that are known to
interfere with the cytochrome p450 (e.g., ketoconazole, diltiazem, rifampicin) and p-glycoprotein transport (cyclosporin)
systems; or agents with a narrow therapeutic safety window
(e.g., warfarin, digoxin). in line with this profile,  xxxd2487xxx 
has no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions with
drugs commonly used in patients with t2dm, including
the glucose-lowering agents metformin, pioglitazone or
 xxxd2215xxx  [58], or agents commonly used in patients with
2.7

106

cardiovascular disorders (warfarin or digoxin [58], or simvastatin [59]). rifampicin can reduce  xxxd2487xxx  exposure, suggesting that  xxxd2487xxx  efficacy may be reduced when
administered with a p-glycoprotein or cyp3a4 inducer [36].
importantly,  xxxd2487xxx  does not require dose adjustment in patients with hepatic impairment [60] or renal
impairment [44,47,48].
regulatory affairs
 xxxd2487xxx  has been recently approved in the us, japan and
europe for the treatment of t2dm. the drug is approved as
monotherapy or in combination with other commonly prescribed medications for t2dm, such as metformin, sulfonylureas and pioglitazone. two other dpp-4 inhibitors are
currently approved for use in the us and europe for the treatment of t2dm:  xxxd3176xxx  ( xxxd3176xxx , bristol-myers
squibb) and sitagliptin (januvia, merck).  xxxd3510xxx 
(galvus, novartis) is approved in europe but not in the
us. so far, alogliptin (nesina, takeda) has been approved
for use only in japan.
 xxxd2487xxx  is the first member of its class to be approved
at one dosage strength (5 mg, once daily), with no dosage
adjustment required for patients with renal or hepatic
impairment [36]. by contrast, prescribing information for  xxxd3176xxx  and sitagliptin recommends dosage adjustment in
patients with renal impairment [61-63]. because there is a
need for dosage adjustment of both  xxxd3176xxx  and sitagliptin
in patients at risk of declining renal function, the prescribing
information for both products recommends that patients
undergo assessment of renal function prior to initiation of
treatment and periodically thereafter. the prescribing information for sitagliptin also refers to postmarketing reports of
worsening renal function in patients with renal insufficiency,
some of whom were prescribed inappropriate doses of the
drug, and highlights the importance of dose adjustment in
such [51] patients. because of limited experience with  xxxd3510xxx  in patients with moderate or severe impairment of
renal function, the drug is not recommended for use in these
patients [64]. since patients with t2dm are at risk of declining renal function, these considerations may play a role in
treatment decisions within the dpp-4 inhibitor class.

conclusions

oral  xxxd2487xxx  5 mg once daily is an effective, welltolerated dpp-4 inhibitor, suitable for use in a wide range
of patients with t2dm, and has a unique pharmacokinetic
and pharmacodynamic profile compared with other agents
in its class.  xxxd2487xxx  is suitable for administration either
alone or in combination with other diabetes treatments
including metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones,
and several combination therapies are at various stages of clinical development. in contrast to other dpp-4 inhibitors,  xxxd2487xxx  does not require dose adjustment in patients with renal
impairment. this is likely to be an important benefit to

forst & pfützner

patients with t2dm, a population that has a high risk and
prevalence of declining renal function.

expert opinion

a number of dpp-4 inhibitors have been approved for the
treatment of t2dm, most recently  xxxd2487xxx . modern pharmacological interventions in patients with t2dm will have to
consider the individual medical requirements of a patient, and
the selection of different glucose-lowering drugs should be
based on their therapeutic capabilities, taking into account
their potential side effects.
 xxxd2487xxx  and the other dpp-4 inhibitors offer clinically
meaningful improvements in fpg and ppg levels without
increasing the risk of hypoglycemia or weight gain. in addition, there is increasing evidence that dpp-4 inhibitors exert
additional beneficial effects on b-cell function and improve
several cardiovascular risk factors, in addition to improving
metabolic control.

the profile of  xxxd2487xxx  extends the established benefits
of dpp-4 inhibitors since the metabolism of  xxxd2487xxx  is
mostly independent of renal function. the other available
dpp-4 inhibitors are not recommended in patients with
renal insufficiency, or their dosage has to be adjusted according to levels of renal impairment. the ongoing carolina
study will provide additional clarification regarding the benefits of  xxxd2487xxx  on cardiovascular outcomes in patients
with t2dm.
