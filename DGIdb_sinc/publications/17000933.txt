 xxxd2554xxx  but not  xxxd1946xxx  ablates the protective function of  xxxd2037xxx  in aldosterone salt-treated rats.  controversial results obtained from human and animal studies on the prevention of heart disease by estrogens and progestins warrant a better understanding of nuclear  xxxg1603xxx  function and interaction. to address this issue and taking into account that effects of synthetic progestins are not only referable to action through the  xxxg1737xxx  but may also be mediated by other steroid receptors, we characterized cardiovascular function and inflammatory gene expression in aldosterone salt-treated rats on long-term administration of 17beta-estradiol,  xxxd2554xxx , and  xxxd1946xxx , a new progestogen exhibiting antimineralocorticoid activity. the complex pattern of cardiovascular injury in ovariectomized wistar rats induced by chronic aldosterone infusion plus a high-salt diet was significantly attenuated in sham-ovariectomized rats and by coadministration of 17beta-estradiol in ovariectomized animals after 8 weeks of continuous treatment. the beneficial role of 17beta-estradiol on blood pressure, cardiac hypertrophy, vascular osteopontin expression, perivascular fibrosis, and impaired no-dependent relaxation of isolated aortic rings was completely abrogated by coadministration of  xxxd2554xxx . in contrast,  xxxd1946xxx  was either neutral or additive to 17beta-estradiol in protecting against aldosterone salt-induced cardiovascular injury and inflammation. the current results support the hypothesis of complex interactions among estrogen, progesterone, glucocorticoid, androgen, and  xxxg1602xxx  signaling in cardiovascular injury and inflammation. novel progestins, such as  xxxd1946xxx , confer superior effects compared with  xxxd2554xxx  in a model of aldosterone-induced heart disease because of its antimineralocorticoid properties.
