role of central histaminergic system in lorazepam withdrawal syndrome in rats.  effects of histaminergic agonists and antagonists were investigated on withdrawal signs in lorazepam-dependent rats. physical dependence was developed by giving lorazepam admixed with the food in the following dose schedule (in mg/kg given daily x days): 10 x 4, 20 x 4, 40 x 4, 80 x 4, and 120 x 7. the parameters observed during the periods of administration of lorazepam and after its withdrawal were spontaneous locomotor activity (sla), reaction time to pain, foot shock aggression (fsa), and audiogenic seizures. during the withdrawal period, the rats were divided into groups of 10 each. control-withdrawal group did not receive any drug. the drugs (in mg/kg administered intramuscularly)-- xxxd2282xxx  (50), histamine-n-methyl (2), promethazine (10),  xxxd2906xxx  (10),  xxxd236xxx  (10), and thioperamide (1)--were given separately in other groups daily during the withdrawal period. the withdrawal signs in control group were hyperkinesia, hyperaggression, and audiogenic seizures.  xxxd2282xxx , precursor of histamine, and thioperamide, antagonist of h3 receptor, potentiated hyperkinesia, hyperaggression, and audiogenic seizures. histamine-n-methyl, agonist of h3 receptor, and  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists, promethazine and  xxxd2906xxx , blocked all the withdrawal signs.  xxxd236xxx , a peripheral antagonist of  xxxg1078xxx , could not affect any withdrawal sign. it may be concluded that histamine h1 receptors are facilitatory and h3 receptors are inhibitory for benzodiazepine ( xxxd1459xxx ) withdrawal syndrome.
