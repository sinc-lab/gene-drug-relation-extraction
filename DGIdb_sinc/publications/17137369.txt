 xxxd1789xxx  synthetase ( xxxg546xxx ) catalyzes the formation of  xxxd1789xxx  from glutamine,
uridine-5′-triphosphate (utp), and adenosine-5′-triphosphate. inhibitors of  xxxg546xxx  are of interest because
of their potential as therapeutic agents. one approach to potent enzyme inhibitors is to use analogues of
high energy intermediates formed during the reaction. the  xxxg546xxx  reaction proceeds via the high energy
intermediate utp-4-phosphate (utp-4-p). four novel analogues of uridine-4-phosphate (u-4-p) and
3-deazauridine-4-phosphate (3-deazau-4-p) were synthesized in which the labile phosphate ester oxygen
was replaced with a methylene and difluoromethylene group. the methylene analogue of u-4-p, compound
1, was prepared by a reaction of the sodium salt of tert-butyl diethylphosphonoacetate with protected,
4-o-activated uridine followed by acetate deprotection and decarboxylation. it was found that this
compound undergoes relatively facile dephosphonylation presumably via a metaphosphate intermediate.
the difluoromethylene derivative, compound 2, was prepared by electrophilic fluorination of protected
1. this compound was stable and did not undergo dephosphonylation. synthesis of the methylene analogue
of 3-deazau-4-p, compound 3, was achieved by ribosylation of protected 4-(phosphonomethyl)-2hydroxypyridine. electrophilic fluorination was also employed in the preparation of protected 4-(phosphonodifluoromethyl)-2-hydroxypyridine which was used as the key building block in the synthesis of difluoro
derivative 4. these compounds represent the first examples of a nucleoside in which the base has been
chemically modified with a methylene or difluormethylenephosphonate group.

introduction
the synthesis of chemically modified nucleosides is a very
active area of chemical research. this is mainly due to their
therapeutic potential as evidenced by the considerable number
of nucleoside analogues that are now on the market as antiviral
and anticancer agents.1 our interest in nucleoside analogues
stems from our desire to prepare inhibitors of  xxxd1789xxx  synthetase ( xxxg546xxx , e. c. 6.4.3.2).  xxxg546xxx  catalyzes

the formation of  xxxd1789xxx  (ctp) from glutamine,
uridine-5′-triphosphate (utp), and adenosine-5′-triphosphate
(atp; scheme 1). it has been proposed, on the basis of
numerous mechanistic investigations,2 that  xxxg546xxx  performs this
reaction by transferring the gamma-phosphate from atp to the oxygen
at position 4 of utp to form utp-4-phosphate (utp-4-p) as
an intermediate and adenosine-5′-diphosphate (adp). ammonia,

hydrolysis, then displaces the phosphate at the o-4 of utp4-p to give ctp. the reaction catalyzed by  xxxg546xxx  is the ratelimiting step in the biosynthesis of all cytosine nucleotides and
provides one of the crucial building blocks for dna synthesis.
therefore, it is hardly surprising that inhibitors of  xxxg546xxx  are
being examined as a means of decreasing the viability of certain
cancers and pathogenic organisms. for example, the nucleoside
analogues 3-deazauridine (3-dau) and cyclopentenylcytosine
(cpec) are triphosphorylated intracellularly which inhibits
 xxxg546xxx  and reduces intracellular ctp levels.3,4 studies with
several cancer cell lines and viruses indicate that 3-dau and
cpec potentiate the effects of various anticancer and antiviral
agents which suggests that they could be employed in combination drug therapy.5 more recently, 3-dau alone has been shown
to induce apoptosis in myeloid leukemia cells in a dosedependent manner.6 one method of generating potent inhibitors
of enzymes is to use analogues either of the transition state of
the reaction or of a high energy intermediate formed during
catalysis.7 utp-4-p is a high energy intermediate formed during
the  xxxg546xxx  reaction. consequently, a hydrolytically stable
analogue of this species may exhibit potent inhibition of  xxxg546xxx .
analogues of phosphorylated compounds which contain the
isosteric and/or isoelectronic methylene or difluoromethylene
phosphonate moiety in place of the phosphate group often inhibit
enzymes which act upon phosphorylated substrates.8 here we
report the synthesis of four novel analogues of uridine-4phosphate (u-4-p) and 3-deazauridine-4-phosphate (3-dau-4p), compounds 1-4 (chart 1), in which the labile phosphate
group is replaced with a methylene- or difluoromethylenephoshonate moiety.

results and discussion
there are only a limited number of reports of phosphonopyrimidine ribonucleosides. honjo et al. have reported the synthesis
of 2′,3′,5′-tri-o-benzoyl-4-diethylphosphonouridine by reacting
1-(2′,3′,5′-tri-o-benzoyl-beta-d-ribofuranosyl)-4-chloro-2(h)-pyrimidinone with triethyl phosphite.9 these workers also reported
the synthesis of 5- and 6-phosphonouridine by reaction of
lithiated 2′,3′,5′-tri-o-protected uridine with diethylchlorophosphate followed by deprotection.9 maruyama and co-workers
have reported the synthesis of phosphonopyrimidine ribonucleosides by photolysis of 2′,3′-di-o- or 2′,3′,5′-tri-o-protected
5-bromouridine and triethylphosphite.10 in all of these cases,
the phosphonate group is attached directly to the pyrimidine
ring. to our knowledge, nucleosides where the base bears a
methylene or difluormethylenephosphonic acid group have never
been reported.
we began our studies with the synthesis of compound 1, in
which the o-4 of u-4-p was replaced with a methylene unit.

synthesis of compound 1

4-position of protected uridines followed by reaction with
malonyl-type nucleophiles.14 we anticipated that bischofberger’s
approach would be applicable to the synthesis of 1 by reacting
a protected phosphonoacetate derivative with protected, 4-oactivated uridine followed by acetate deprotection and decarboxylation. thus, 2′,3′,5-tri-o-benzoyluridine was activated at
the 4-position by reaction with triisopropylbenzenesulfonylchloride (tipbscl) in the presence of triethylamine which gave
compound 5 in a 62% yield (scheme 2). the reaction of 5 with
2.1 equiv of benzyl dimethylphosphonoacetate (6)15 gave
compound 7 in an 88% yield. we anticipated that upon
hydrogenolysis of the benzyl group in 7 the resulting carboxylic
acid would then spontaneously decarboxylate to give phosphonate 10.12b however, the yield of this reaction was surprisingly
low, and although some of the desired product was isolated, it
was contaminated with a considerable amount of the  xxxd3335xxx  derivative which resulted from hydrogenation of the
pyrimidine ring at c-5 and c-6; we were unable to obtain 10
in pure form. therefore, the sodium salt of tert-butyl dimethylphosphonoacetate 816 was used, which gave  xxxd543xxx  in
an 83% yield. treatment of 9 with tfa in ch2cl2 at -10 °c
resulted in the removal of the tert-butyl group and decarboxylation, which gave compound 10 in an 83% yield. 1h nmr
revealed that, in cdcl3, compound 10 existed exclusively as
the tautomer in which the double bond is exocyclic to the
pyrimidine ring.
deprotection of the phosphonate moiety in 10 was achieved
by a reaction with tmsbr in ch2cl2 for 8 h. after removal of
the solvent and unreacted tmsbr, the residue was subjected to
nh4oh/meoh for 24 h to remove the benzoyl-protecting
groups, after which the reaction was concentrated and then
lyophilized several times to remove excess nh4oh. a 31p nmr
spectrum of the crude product in d2o showed that, in addition
to a large peak at 15.8 ppm which corresponded to compound
1, a very small peak at 1.7 ppm, which was approximately 2%
of the intensity of the peak at 15.8 ppm, was also present.

spiking the sample with sodium phosphate resulted in an
increase in the size of the minor peak, which suggested that
the minor peak was inorganic phosphate. attempts to purify
nucleoside 1 by rp-hplc using a variety of different eluents
at different ph values proved unsuccessful, in that the minor
peak was always present in varying amounts after hplc and
conversion to the sodium salt. additional 31p nmr studies in
d2o showed that compound 1 decomposed over time as the
peak at 15.8 ppm decreased and the peak at 1.7 ppm increased.
after 48 h, the peak at 1.7 ppm exhibited 25% of the intensity
of the peak at 15.8 ppm. decomposition of 10 occurred faster
in a 3:2 dmso-d6-d2o mixture. a 31p nmr spectrum of the
compound taken within the first 20 min of dissolution showed
a major peak at 13.0 ppm and a small peak at 0.8 ppm. after
just 48 h, the peak at 13.0 ppm had almost disappeared, and
the peak at 0.8 ppm was by far the major peak (figure 1). the
negative esi mass spectrum revealed a strong peak with a m/z
of 321 which corresponds to compound 1. among the peaks in
the positive esi mass spectrum was a peak with a m/z of 243.
this peak increased in intensity during storage of 1 in water or
dmso-water. the 1h nmr of this material revealed that
compound 1 exists mainly as the cdn tautomer in d2o as
evidenced by a doublet at approximately 3.0 ppm, which
corresponds to that of the methylene protons adjacent to the
phosphorus. this doublet almost completely disappeared after
9 h in d2o indicating that these protons are readily exchanged
with the solvent’s deuterons. a doublet at 6.6 ppm corresponding to the h-5 proton of 1 slowly decreased with time while
another doublet at 6.5 ppm, which initially constituted 5% of
these two doublets, increased over time and, after 48 h, then
constituted 25% of these doublets. in the 3:2 dmso-d6-d2o
mixture, the doublet at 6.5 ppm constituted approximately 87%
of these two doublets after 48 h. finally, a small broad singlet
at 2.3 ppm, which was present within the first 15 min after
dissolution in d2o, was barely evident after 48 h.
these studies reveal that 10 dephosphonylates in solution to
give 1-(beta-d-ribofuranosyl)-4-methyl-2-pyrimidinone (11; scheme
3) and inorganic phosphate. the new doublet at 6.5 ppm and
the singlet at 2.3 ppm correspond to the h-5 proton and the

uridine- and 3-deazauridine-4-phosphate analogues

methyl protons in compound 11.17 the methyl protons exchange
slowly with the solvent deuterons. the high-resolution positive
ion esi mass spectrum of the peak with a m/z of 243 was also
consistent with the decomposition product being compound 11.
carbon-phosphorus bonds are usually highly resistant to
hydrolysis. nevertheless, some phosphonates are unstable
toward c-p bond cleavage giving inorganic phosphate and/or
polyphosphates. this has been well documented for beta-carbonyl
phosphonates, though usually these reactions require elevated
temperatures and prolonged reaction times at a neutral ph.18 it
has been suggested that these reactions proceed by a dissociative
mechanism involving metaphosphate.18 the dephosphonylation
of 10 occurs with considerable ease and probably proceeds via
a similar mechanism involving metaphosphate or a metaphos(17) 1-(beta-d-ribofuranosyl)-4-methyl-2-pyrimidinone (11) is a known
compound. see: holy, a.; ludzisa, a.; votruba, i.; sediva, k.; pischel,

phate-like transition state (scheme 3). we are not aware of any
studies demonstrating this phenomenon with 4-phosphonomethyl-2-pyrimidinones; however, to our knowledge, this is the
first synthesis of this class of compounds. nevertheless, warren
has shown that aminomethylphosphonic acid reacts instantaneously at room temperature with ninhydrin in aq ethylene
glycol and triethylamine to give a mixture of inorganic
phosphate and 2-hydroxyethylphosphate.19 it was suggested that
this reaction proceeds by formation of imine 12 followed by
rapid decomposition via formation of metaphosphate (scheme
4).19 martell and langohr have suggested that the facile
dephosphonylation of the metal chelate of the imine resulting
from the reaction of 2-amino- xxxd495xxx  with
pyridoxal proceeds by the unimolecular dissociation of metaphosphate.20
to prepare the fluorinated analogue of 1, phosphonate 10
was subjected to electrophilic fluorination21 using potassium
hexamethyldisilazane (kmhds) and n-fluorobenzenesulfonimide (nfsi) which gave compound 13 in a 45% yield (scheme
5). complete deprotection of 13, as described above for
compound 10, gave compound 2 in a 51% yield after purification by hplc and conversion to its sodium salt. unlike
compound 1, compound 2 did not undergo any detectable
dephosphonylation even when stored for days in d2o or dmso.
very little has appeared in the literature concerning the influence
of r-fluorines on the rates of decarboxylation of beta-keto
carboxylic acid, and, to our knowledge, no studies concerning
their effect on the dephosphonylation of beta-ketophosphonates
or beta-iminophosphonates have been reported. bartlett et al. have
noted that difluorooxaloacetic acid is extraordinarily resistant
to decarboxylation in an aqueous solution. this was attributed
to the difficulty in cracking the hydrate which dominates in
aqueous solutions as well as to the destabilizing influence of

the fluorines on enol formation.22 it is possible that the presence
of the fluorines may have a destabilizing influence on the
formation of the enamine-type compounds 14 and 15 (chart
2), and this may also account for the stability of 2 toward
dephosphonylation.
3-deazautp is an inhibitor of ctp synthetase.3,4  xxxg546xxx 
exhibits the same affinity for 3-deazautp as it does for the
substrate utp which indicates that the enzyme does not require
the nitrogen at the 3-position for binding, at least in the ground
state.2 we anticipated that deaza nucleotides 3 and 4 would
exhibit an affinity for  xxxg546xxx  which is similar to that of aza
compounds 1 and 2, yet neither would undergo dephosphonylation because of the lack of a nitrogen at the 3-position. our
approach to compound 3, as illustrated in scheme 6, was to
couple phosphonate 16 to an appropriately protected ribofuranose derivative. our initial route to phosphonate 16 was via
alkyl chloride 17 which has been prepared by uchida et al. by
lialh4 reduction of the 4-carbomethoxy-2-hydroxypyridine (18)
followed by a reaction of the crude alcohol product with

socl2.23 to this end,  xxxd774xxx  was prepared in a 29% yield
from 4-carbomethoxypyridine using the method of boekelheide
and lehn which involved oxidation of 4-carbomethoxypyridine
to the n-oxide (19) followed by a reaction with refluxing ac2o
(scheme 7).24,25 in our hands, uchida’s procedure for the
synthesis of 17 from 18 proceeded with a yield of only 21%.
finally, we were unable to obtain phosphonate 16 from 17 in
yields greater than 35% which translates to an overall yield of
16 from 4-carbomethoxy-2-pyridinone of just 2.1%.
because of the low yields using the approach outlined in
scheme 7, alternative routes to 16 were examined (scheme 8).
a reaction of 2-chloroisonicotinic acid (20) with thionyl chloride
followed by a reaction of the crude acid chloride with benzyl
alcohol gave the corresponding 2-o-benzyl derivative 21.26 the
crude ester was reacted with the sodium salt of benzyl alcohol
which gave the dibenzyl-protected compound 21 in an 80% yield
(three steps).26 reduction of the ester with libh4 in the presence
of a small amount of methanol in refluxing ether gave compound
22 in an 86% yield. reaction of compound 22 with pobr3 in
dmf/ch2cl2 gave alkyl bromide 23 in a 77% yield. a
michaelis-arbuzov reaction between 23 and trimethylphosphite
performed either neat or in benzene resulted in reactions at both
the methylbromide moiety and the benzylic carbon of the
benzyl-protecting group. this afforded a mixture of the desired
product 24 and dimethyl benzylphosphonate in an overall low
yield, and we were unable to separate 24 from the contaminating
dimethyl benzylphosphonate. hydrogenolysis of crude 24 gave
16 in a 24% yield from 23 (two steps). the reaction of 23 with
the sodium salt of dimethylphosphite also proceeded very poorly.
although this route was an improvement over the approach
taken in scheme 7, the difficulties encountered with the
michaelis-arbuzov reaction prompted us to devise an alternative route to 16 (scheme 8). compound 20 was converted to
2-hydroxyisonicotinic acid (25) in an 89% yield by heating it
in concd hcl for 48 h. reduction of the acid moiety using bh3thf gave alcohol 26 in a 54% yield. the reaction of 26 with

methane sulfonylbromide in the presence of 2,6-lutidine resulted
both in bromination of the hydroxylmethyl functionality and in
sulfonation at the 2-position to give compound 27 in  xxxd2051xxx %
yield. the michaelis-arbuzov reaction between 27 and trimethylphosphite proceeded smoothly to give phosphonate 28
in a 93% yield. finally, the removal of the sulfonate group was
achieved using lioh in thf-h2o which gave compound 16
in a 76% yield. using this approach, we found that the overall
yield of 16 improved to 24%.
to obtain compound 3, phosphonate 16 was treated with bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (btmstfa) followed by a
reaction with acetyl 2,3,5-tri-o-benzoyl-beta-d-ribofuranose in the
presence of trimethylsilyl triflate (tmsotf; scheme 9). this
gave nucleoside 29 in a 65% yield. complete deprotection of

29 was achieved by treatment with 3 equiv of tmsbr for 8 h
followed by a reaction with aq nh4oh in methanol for 24 h.
hplc purification of the resulting material using tfa (0.1%)
in h2o-ch3cn as the eluent gave 3 as its free acid in a 90%
yield. nucleoside 3 did not exhibit any decomposition even after
storage for several weeks in water or dmso indicating that
the ring nitrogen is essential for dephosphonylation.
we initially attempted to construct compound 4 by electrophilic fluorination of compound 29 followed by deprotection
in a manner analogous to that described for the synthesis of
compound 2 (scheme 9). although 19f nmr spectra of the
crude product suggested that electrophilic fluorination of 29 gave
the desired compound 30, a number of byproducts were also
formed, and we were unable to obtain 30 in pure form.

synthesis of compound 4

therefore, for the synthesis of compound 4, we envisaged a
route similar to that taken for nucleoside 29 where the
difluoromethylenephosphonate analogue of 16 would be prepared and then coupled to the protected ribose. unfortunately,
electrophilic fluorination of 16 gave a complex mixture of
products. nevertheless, we reasoned that a hydroxyl-protected
version of 16 would undergo electrophilic fluorination more
cleanly. phosphonate 28 was not considered to be a viable
candidate for electrophilic fluorination because of the presence
of the methylsulfonate moiety. nonetheless, we reasoned that
phosphonate 24, which contained a benzyl-protected hydroxyl
group, would readily undergo electrophilic fluorination. unfortunately, preparing this compound was problematic because of
the low yield of the michaelis-arbuzov reaction. however,
we were surprised to find that when performing the michaelisarbuzov reaction on 23 with triethylphosphite in benzene at
95-105 °c, phosphonate 31 could be obtained in a 93% yield,
and no diethyl benzylphosphonate was formed (scheme 10).27
the reason for the difference in yield and product distribution
when using the two different phosphites is not clear. one
possible explanation is that the benzylic carbon may be slightly
more sterically hindered than the alkyl bromide carbon and,
therefore, might be less susceptible to an attack by the more
bulky triethylphosphite. fluorination of 31 using 2.2 equiv of
nahmds and 2.5 equiv of nfsi gave compound 32 in an 87%
yield. the benzyl group in 32 was removed by hydrogenolysis
using catalyst pd/c to give  xxxd3171xxx  in a 95% yield.
coupling of phosphonate 33 to acetyl 2,3,5-tri-o-acetyl-beta-dribofuranose using the procedure described above for the
synthesis of 29 gave the protected nucleoside 34 in a 78% yield.
complete deprotection of 34 was achieved in the usual manner,
except removal of the ethyl-protecting groups from 34 required
8 equiv of tmsbr added over a period of 3 days. it has been
reported that anomerization can occur when subjecting 2′-deoxy
nucleotide analogues to tmsbr.28 however, 31p and 1h nmr
analysis of the crude reaction mixture revealed that anomer(27) this was discovered after compound 3 was prepared, and so
phosphonate 31 was not used for the synthesis of compound 3. in any case,
we preferred methyl-protecting groups as opposed to ethyl-protecting groups
for phosphonate protection since methyl groups are removed more readily
by tmsbr than ethyl groups; this reduces the compounds exposure to
tmsbr which can cause side reactions and lower yields. we would have
preferred methyl protection for the synthesis of compound 4; however, this
was not practical.

ization had not taken place. this could be due to the presence
of the benzoyl-protecting group at the 2′-position. after hplc
purification using tfa (0.1%) in h2o-ch3cn as the eluent,
nucleoside 4 was obtained as its free acid in a 45% yield. this
deprotection yield is somewhat lower than that of its nonfluorinated analogue 3, and this is probably due to the prolonged
exposure of 34 to tmsbr. as with nucleoside 3, compound 4
was stable and did not exhibit any dephosphonylation even after
prolonged storage in various solvents.
in summary, several unique analogues of u-4-p and 3-deazau-4-p were prepared in which the labile phosphate ester
oxygen was replaced with either a methylene or a difluoromethylene group. the methylene analogue of u-4-p, compound
1, was readily prepared by a reaction of the sodium salt of a
tert-butyl diethylphosphonoacetate with protected, 4-o-activated
uridine followed by acetate deprotection and decarboxylation.
however, we were not able to isolate 1 in pure form because
of its tendency to undergo dephosphonylation, possibly via a
metaphosphate intermediate. the difluoromethylene analogue
of 1, nucleoside 2, was prepared by electrophilic fluorination
of protected 1. this compound did not undergo dephosphonylation. the synthesis of the methylene analogue of 3-deazau4-p, compound 3, was achieved by ribosylation of protected
4-(phosphonomethyl)-2-hydroxypyridine followed by deprotection. electrophilic fluorination was also employed in the
preparation of protected 4-(phosphonodifluoromethyl)-2-hydroxypyridine which was ribosylated and then deprotected to
give difluoro derivative 4. to our knowledge, compounds 1-4
represent the first examples of ribonucleosides in which the base
has been chemically modified with a methylene or difluoromethylenephosphonate group. the antiproliferative properties
of these compounds will be examined, and the results will be
reported in due course. finally, it has not escaped our attention
that the cell permeability of these compounds may be compromised because oftheir highly anionic nature. if necessary, more
cell permeable phosphonate diester or phosphoramidate prodrug
derivatives29 of these compounds will be prepared and examined
as antiproliferative agents.

of the solvent and after lyophilization from water (five times),
compounds 1 and 2 were obtained as their triethylammonium salts.
the triethylammonium salts are hygroscopic. therefore, they were
passed through a small dowex 50 na+ ion exchange column which
gave compounds 1 and 2 as their sodium salts and as easy-to-handle

mmol) and acetyl 2,3,5-tri-o-acetyl-beta-d-ribofuranose (0.113 g, 0.36
mmol) in dry ch3cn (2 ml) was added btmstfa (0.113 ml,
0.42 mmol), and it was stirred at rt for 2 h. to this was added
tmsotf (0.077 ml, 0.42 mmol), and that was stirred for 3 h. the
reaction was diluted with etoac (40 ml), washed with saturated
nahco3 and brine, dried ( xxxd2534xxx ), and concentrated. purification
