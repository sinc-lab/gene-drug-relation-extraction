 xxxg1807xxx  (ppargammagamma), one of the nuclear receptors expressed in
adipose tissue, plays an important role in adipocyte differentiation. in this study, we investigated
the expression of ppargammagamma and its role in cellular growth and differentiation in six colon cancer cell
lines: ht-29, caco-2, sw-480, dld-1, lovo, and t-84. all six expressed ppargammagamma mrna and protein, shown respectively on northern and western blot analyses. luciferase assay in ht-29 cells,
which strongly express ppargammagamma, showed that troglitazone, a selective ligand for ppargammagamma, transactivated the transcription of a peroxisome proliferator response element (ppre)-driven promoter.
furthermore, troglitazone caused a marked decrease in [3h]thymidine incorporation and g1 cellcycle arrest determined by flow cytometry. finally, troglitazone induced expression of mrnas for
villin and  xxxg149xxx , markers for enterocyte differentiation. in conclusion,
human colon cancer cells express ppargammagamma, the ligands of which inhibit cell growth and induce differentiation markers.
key words:

 xxxg1807xxx  — colon cancer cells — differentiation

 xxxg1807xxx  ( xxxg1807xxx ), a
member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, has been
linked to adipocyte differentiation and the control of cellular lipid uptake.1, 2) forced expression and activation of
 xxxg1807xxx  in fibroblasts trigger the adipocyte gene expression cascade and lead to the development of the adipose
phenotype.  xxxg1807xxx  forms a heterodimeric dna-binding
complex with the 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  receptor, recognizes
the peroxisomal proliferator response element (ppre) in
the promoter of its target genes, and functions as a transcriptional regulator of genes linked to lipid metabolism.
several polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx , the thiazolidinedione
class of antidiabetic drugs such as troglitazone, and the
nuclear prostanoid 15-deoxy-∆ 12, 14-prostaglandin j2 (15dpgj2) have been identified as ligands for  xxxg1807xxx .3–6)
although adipose tissue has been recognized as a principal site of  xxxg1807xxx  expression, this receptor is expressed at
low levels in some other tissues such as kidney, liver,
small intestine, and large intestine.7, 8)
recent reports indicate that  xxxg1807xxx  is expressed at significant levels in human liposarcoma and breast adenocarcinomas and that treatment with  xxxg1807xxx  ligands reduces
the growth rate and induces terminal differentiation of
these malignant cells.9, 10) in the large intestine,  xxxg1807xxx 
has been shown to be expressed in colonic tumors of
azoxymethane-treated rats and in certain human colon
cancer cell lines.11) however, the role of  xxxg1807xxx  in colon
cancers has not been elucidated.

in the present study, we investigated the expression of
 xxxg1807xxx  and its role in cellular growth and differentiation
in several colon cancer cell lines: ht-29, caco-2, sw480, dld-1, lovo, and t-84. we found that  xxxg1807xxx  is
expressed in these cell lines and that activation of this
receptor by its ligands inhibits cell growth and induces
cell differentiation.
materials and methods

cell cultures all cell lines were obtained from american
type culture collection (atcc, rockville, md). cells
were grown in 100-mm plastic dishes at 37°c using 5%
co2 in the following media supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (bop-whittaker, walkersville, md), and
100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin: dulbecco’s modified essential medium (gibco brl, grand
island, ny) for ht-29, caco-2, and t-84; ham’s f-12
medium (gibco brl) for lovo; and rpmi-1640 medium
(gibco brl) for sw-480 and dld-1. the media were
changed every 3 days, and the cells were separated via
trypsinization when they reached subconfluence. experiments were performed on growing cells, and the media
were changed 24 h prior to the start of each experiment.
the cells were treated with various concentrations of troglitazone (donated by sankyo pharmaceuticals, tokyo),
15dpgj2 (cayman chemical company, ann arbor, mi),
and  xxxd331xxx  (donated by kissei pharmaceuticals,
tokyo).
mitogenic assays ht-29 cells were seeded at a concen-

75

jpn. j. cancer res. 90, january 1999

tration of 1×105 cells/well in 96-well plates and incubated
in complete fresh media for 24 h. the cells were subsequently incubated for 20 h with 0, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 25, 50, or
75 µm 15dpgj2, troglitazone, or  xxxd331xxx  and further
incubated with 1 mci/ml [3h]thymidine (amersham,
arlington heights, il) for 4 h. the cells were washed
three times with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and separated via trypsinization. then the [3h]thymidine incorporation was measured by use of the betaplate system
(pharmacia, uppsala, sweden).
cell counts cells (5×105 cells/ml) were seeded and incubated in complete fresh media for 24 h, then incubated
with 0, 25, or 50 µm troglitazone. after 0, 1, 2, and 4
days, the cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed
with pbs, resuspended in media, and counted using a
hemacytometer.
northern blot analysis cells were grown to subconfluence in 100-mm dishes. total rna was extracted by the
guanidinium thiocyanate method.12) in some cases,
poly(a+)mrna was isolated by allowing it to bind to
oligo(dt) cellulose (takara, tokyo). about 10 µg of each
rna was electrophoresed on 1.0% agarose/2.2 m formaldehyde denaturing gel, transferred to hybond-n+ membranes (amersham), and uv-cross-linked (1200 mj).
hybridization was performed using cdna probes labeled
by random priming (multiprime dna labeling system;
amersham) with [alpha-32p]dctp (dupont-nen, boston,
ma) in rapid-hyb buffer (amersham). the human
 xxxg1807xxx  probe was constructed by reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) amplification of a
263-bp  xxxg1807xxx  cdna fragment from human colon total
rna, using the oligonucleotides 5′-gagatcacagagtatgccaa-3′ and 5′-ctgtcatctaattccagtgc-3′.
the villin probe was constructed by rt-pcr amplification of a 332-bp villin cdna fragment from ht-29 cell
total rna, using the oligonucleotides 5′-accttcacaggctggttcct-3′ and 5′-attccatcgaggcagagcag-3′. the  xxxg149xxx  (iap)
probe, a 2.5-kb ecori fragment derived from human iap
cdna, was purchased from atcc. the  xxxg861xxx  probe, a
1.1-kb xbai-hindiii fragment of rat glyceraldehyde 3phosphate dehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx ) cdna, was a gift
from dr. t. nakamura (osaka university medical school,
osaka). quantitated hybridization signals were normalized
to the control gene  xxxg861xxx  and expressed relative to the
control values.
 xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and western blot analysis cells
grown to subconfluence in 100-mm dishes were lysed in
lysis buffer containing 20 mm tris (ph 8.0), 137 mm
nacl, 10% glycerol, 1% nonidet p-40, 10 mm edta,
100 mm naf, 1 mm pmsf, 0.25 tiu/ml aprotinin, and
10 mg/ml leupeptin. aliquots containing 50 µg total protein were size-fractionated by sds-page (5–20% gradi-

76

ent gels), and the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (immobilon, millipore,
bedford, ma). the membranes were blocked with 5%
skim milk and were incubated for 1 h at room temperature
with goat anti-human- xxxg1807xxx  polyclonal antibody (santa
cruz biotechnology, inc., santa cruz, ca). after three
washings with 0.1% tween 20 in tbs, the membranes
were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat igg (n pharmaceuticals,
inc., aurora, oh). the membranes were again washed,
and peroxidase was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ecl, amersham). the protein concentrations of the homogenates were determined with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (pierce, rockford, il).
flow cytometry cell-cycle profiles of ht-29 cells
treated with troglitazone were assessed by measuring the
dna content of individual cells by flow cytometry. in
preparation for flow cytometry, cells treated with 50 µm
troglitazone for 24 h were collected after brief trypsinization, washed with pbs, and fixed with 70% cold ethanol.
then the samples were treated with rnase, stained with
10 mg/ml  xxxd3027xxx  iodine, and analyzed by a cell sorter
(facscan, becton dickinson, mountain view, ca). cellcycle distributions were quantified using cell-quest software.
transfections and luciferase assays ht-29 cells were
seeded at a concentration of 1×106 cells/60-mm dish and
transfected with the plasmids 24 h after having been
transferred to fresh media. transfection was done by
using lipofectamine reagent (gibco brl) mixed with
2 µg of acyl coa oxidase promoter-luciferase plasmid
(kindly donated by dr. osumi)13) and 0.2 µg of prl-sv40
(promega, madison, wi) for 3 h. the transfection mix
was replaced by complete media with or without 50 µm
troglitazone and further incubated for 12 h. the cells were
lysed with 1× luciferase lysis buffer (toyo ink, inc.,
tokyo). luciferase activity was measured using the
picagene reagent kit (toyo ink) in a lumat lb9501
luminometer (berthold, wildbad, germany). the enzyme
activity was normalized for efficiency of transfection, on
the basis of sea pansy luciferase activity, and relative values were determined. transfection experiments were carried out three times independently, and the average values
were calculated.
statistical analysis data are expressed as mean±se. statistical analyses were carried out using student’s unpaired
t test. p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

fig. 1. a:  xxxg1807xxx  mrna expression in human colon cancer
cell lines. approximately 10 µg of each rna obtained from the
colon cancer cell lines was electrophoresed on 1.0% agarose/2.2
m formaldehyde denaturing gel and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes. hybridization was performed using a human  xxxg1807xxx 
cdna probe labeled with [alpha-32p]dctp. the  xxxg861xxx  control is
shown in the bottom panel. b:  xxxg1807xxx  protein expression in
human colon cancer cell lines. approximately 50 µg of each
protein obtained from the colon cancer cell lines was separated
on sds-page, probed with an anti- xxxg1807xxx  antibody, and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence.

 xxxg1807xxx  mrna was expressed in all six.  xxxg1807xxx  mrna
was expressed at high levels in ht-29, lovo, and t-84,
at an intermediate level in dld-1, and at low levels in
sw-480 and caco-2.
fig. 1b shows the expression of  xxxg1807xxx  protein in these
cell lines. the protein showed a molecular mass of
approximately 55 kda in all human colon cancer cell
lines, which is consistent with the reported value for
human  xxxg1807xxx  protein.14) the expression levels of  xxxg1807xxx 
protein were in good accordance with those of mrna.
ppre transactivation in ht-29 cells to determine if
the  xxxg1807xxx  expressed in the cell lines was functional, we
transfected ht-29 cells with an acyl-coa oxidase promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid containing a ppre.13)
over 12 h, luciferase activity in the ht-29 cells treated
with troglitazone, a specific ligand for  xxxg1807xxx ,5) for 12 h was
approximately three-fold that in untreated cells (fig. 2).
ppargammagamma ligands decrease cell growth and induce g1
arrest in ht-29 cells since  xxxg1807xxx  expressed in ht-29
cells was functional, we next examined whether ligand
activation of  xxxg1807xxx  influences the cell growth and the

transiently transfected with an acyl coa promoter luciferase
construct and prl-sv40. after treatment with 50 µm troglitazone for 12 h, cells were harvested, and the dual luciferase
assay was performed as described in “materials and methods.”
data are expressed as mean±se (n=3).

cell cycle of colon cancer cells. treatment with 15dpgj2,
a natural ligand for  xxxg1807xxx , as well as with troglitazone,
reduced the [3h]thymidine incorporation of ht-29 cells in
a dose-dependent manner. however, treatment with  xxxd331xxx , a specific ligand for pparbeta,15) did not affect
[3h]thymidine incorporation (fig. 3a). furthermore, treatment with troglitazone resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation (fig. 3b).
the effect of troglitazone on the cell cycle profile was
analyzed by flow cytometry. representative cell cycle
profiles of cells stained with  xxxd3027xxx  iodide are shown
in fig. 4. the cells exhibited a decreased fraction of s
and g2/m-phase cells resulting from an increased accumulation of cells at g0/g1.
the above results indicate that ligand activation of
 xxxg1807xxx  inhibits cellular growth and induces cell cycle
arrest at g1 in colon cancers. previous studies have
shown that ligand activation of  xxxg1807xxx  induces growth
inhibition and cell cycle withdrawal in liposarcoma and
breast cancer cells.9, 10) our results are compatible with
those reported in such malignant cells.
ppargammagamma activation induces the expression of villin and
iap mrnas in ht-29 cells  xxxg1807xxx  activation is known
to induce terminal differentiation with cell growth inhibition in adipogenic cell lines.16) we hypothesized that
growth inhibition by  xxxg1807xxx  activation would be accompanied by differentiation of the colon cancer cell lines
studied here. to clarify the effect of  xxxg1807xxx  activation
upon differentiation of colon cancer cells, we examined
the expression of villin and iap transcripts, which have
been used as markers for enterocyte differentiation.17, 18)

24 h, and [3h]thymidine incorporation was measured. data represent the mean±se from six identical experiments and are expressed as
a percentage of the values measured in untreated control cells. b: the same numbers of ht-29 cells were cultured with 0, 25, or 50

13.3% and g2/m, 15.9%.

mrna levels in response to  xxxg1807xxx  activation in ht-29
cells. the villin mrna level showed an approximately
4-fold increase following 48 h of 25 µm troglitazone
treatment (fig. 5a). the iap mrna level showed an
approximately 2.5-fold increase after 48 h of 25 µm troglitazone treatment (fig. 5b).
in the large intestine, cellular proliferation is confined
to the basal portions of the crypts, and the cells migrate
upward from the crypt to the villous surface in about 2 to

78

6 days. during this migration, the cells undergo differentiation with the transcriptional activation of a number of
cell type-specific genes, including those for enzymes,
transporters, and structural proteins that reside within the
apical microvilli. iap is one such enzyme expressed
exclusively in the brush-border of villus-associated
enterocytes.17) the microvillar structural protein villin is
also selectively expressed in the villous cells.18) therefore,
both iap and villin are considered to be markers for

fig. 5.  xxxg1807xxx  ligand effects upon the expression of villin and iap transcripts. ht-29 cells were treated with 25 µm troglitazone for
the indicated times. then, total rna (a) or poly(a+)mrna (b) isolated from ht-29 cells was electrophoresed on 1.0% agarose/2.2
m formaldehyde denaturing gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and hybridized with a villin or iap cdna probe, respectively.
blots were hybridized with a  xxxg861xxx  cdna probe. normalized hybridization signals of villin and iap mrna are expressed relative
to the value on day 0 (lower panel).

enterocyte differentiation along the crypt-villus axis.
overall, our results suggest that ligand activation of
 xxxg1807xxx  can induce growth arrest and differentiation of
ht-29 cells. interestingly, immunohistochemical studies
have revealed that a high expression of  xxxg1807xxx  is
observed in the more differentiated murine colonic epithelial cells facing the intestinal lumen compared with cells
in the lower parts of the crypts.19)  xxxg1807xxx  may play a
physiological role in the differentiation of normal colonic
epithelial cells.
in summary, this study shows that  xxxg1807xxx  is expressed
in human colon cancer cells and that  xxxg1807xxx  ligands
inhibit cell growth and induce differentiation markers.

these tumor-suppressive effects of  xxxg1807xxx  may provide
an approach to the treatment of colorectal cancer, which is
one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in japan. chemotherapy for colorectal cancers is far from optimal
because it is associated with serious toxicity and its
tumor-suppressive effect is unsatisfactory. since induction
of differentiation is a non-toxic therapeutic approach,
 xxxg1807xxx  ligands such as troglitazone, a widely used antidiabetic drug, may be candidates for a novel, non-toxic
approach to the treatment of colorectal cancers.
