 xxxd348xxx  ( xxxd348xxx , the medicines company) is a synthetic 20 amino
acid peptide rationally designed on the basis of structural studies of hirudin,
a naturally occurring anticoagulant.  xxxd348xxx  represents a new class of
anticoagulant drugs that directly inhibits thrombin, a key component in
blood clot formation and extension. with its high binding affinity and
specificity for thrombin,  xxxd348xxx  acts directly on thrombin, rather than
via other clotting factors. the compound has a variety of potential uses as
an alternative to heparin in the management of cardiovascular disease and
related medical procedures i.e., unstable angina (ua), myocardial infarction (mi) and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (ptca).

1. overview

of the market

unregulated activation of the haemostatic system causes thrombosis and
embolism, which may precipitate a reduction of blood flow to critical
organs such as the brain and the myocardium. the related ischaemic
diseases and in particular the acute coronary syndromes (acs), represent
one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in western countries.
despite this, the pathophysiology of thrombosis is not completely clarified.
as a result, this situation justifies the tremendous interest of pharmacological research into new antithrombotic drugs. above all considering that
the drugs usually used in this set of diseases are relatively few (heparins,
warfarin, nsaids), they all have a therapeutic index which can and must be
ameliorated. to date, numerous novel antithrombotic drugs with different
mechanisms of action are under pharmacological and clinical evaluation. it
could be useful to cite:
• low molecular weight heparins: including enoxaparin,  xxxd2690xxx  and
 xxxd1805xxx , which, in constrast to heparin, preferentially bind to activated
 xxxg741xxx .
• hirudins: different polypeptides such as  xxxd2455xxx , desirudin,
peg-hirudin,  xxxd348xxx ,  xxxd218xxx  and efegatran which are derived
from the leech, manufactured through recombinant dna methods and
directly inhibit thrombin.
• glycoprotein iib/iiia ( xxxg1202xxx /iiia) antagonists: interesting peptide and
non-peptide drugs, for example  xxxd53xxx ,  xxxd2017xxx  and  xxxd3385xxx ,

2. introduction

to the compound

 xxxd348xxx  ( xxxd348xxx , formerly hirulog®, the
medicines company) is an anticoagulant and
antithrombotic drug that directly and selectively
inhibits thrombin, a key  xxxg745xxx  in blood clot
formation and extension. this peculiar mechanism of
action has directed therapeutic use of  xxxd348xxx  to
the acs and related medical procedures (ptca,
thrombolisis and coronary stents). for these indications,  xxxd348xxx  should present the following
advantages [1]:
• it directly inhibits thrombin without requiring
 xxxg2056xxx  and that, among other effects, it
reduces the incidence of hypercoagulation states
after drug discontinuation.
• it inhibits both free and clot-bound thrombin.

i) the active catalytic site
ii) an anion-binding exosite (necessary for fibrin
recognition).
 xxxd348xxx , a 20 amino acid polypeptide derived from
the leech protein hirudin, inhibits blood clotting by
binding to thrombin both at the catalytic site and at the
anion-binding exosite.
structure-activity relationship (sar) studies clearly
showed that hirudin and its derivatives require some
structural characteristics to sustain optimal thrombin
inhibition. these characteristics include:
• an active-site specificity sequence with a restricted
arg-pro scissile bond
• a polymeric linker of four to eight glycyl residues
• an anion-binding-exosite recognition sequence
 xxxd348xxx  (d-fprpggggdgdfeeipeeyl) is a
bivalent inhibitor of thrombin consisting of a moiety
(d-fprp) that binds to the active-site cleft and a
hirudin-like c-terminal region (dgdfeeipeeyl) that
binds to the positively charged surface groove of
thrombin known as the anion-binding exosite. these
domains are linked together by a functionally optimal
polymeric linker of four glycyl residues.

• plasma proteins and platelets do not inactivate it.
• it eliminates the incidence of heparin-induced
thrombocytopaenia and related syndromes.

4. pharmacodynamics

• it can induce more predictable and less variable
levels of anticoagulation, with minor incidence of
bleeding.

4.2 in

the medicines company in 1997 acquired exclusive
worldwide rights to develop and market  xxxd348xxx 
(hirulog ® , renamed  xxxd348xxx ) from biogen.
following acquisition, the medicines company
completed a series a phase iii clinical trials to support
a drug application from the food and drug
administration (fda) and european agency for the
evaluation of medicinal products (emea). moreover,
it has initiated extensive pharmacological and clinical
researches to support  xxxd348xxx  for use in acs.

3. chemistry
thrombin is a  xxxg745xxx  with two fundamental
domains for its enzymatic function:

vitro

the kinetic mechanism for the interaction of  xxxd348xxx  with thrombin was studied in vitro by parry et
al. [3]. results showed that the inhibition constant for
 xxxd348xxx  is 1.9 nm. the drug is slowly degraded by
thrombin with a kcat value of 0.01 per second. the
formation of the complex results in a 44% enhancement in the intrinsic fluorescence of thrombin.
interestingly, the kinetics of the increase in thrombin
fluorescence was described by a double-exponential
decay. the dependence of the rate constant for the
fast phase on the concentration of the drug could be
described by the michaelis-menten equation with km
and kmax values of 0.75 ± 0.12 µm and 325 ± 17 per
second. the author believed that these data are
consistent with a mechanism in which the c-terminal
region of  xxxd348xxx  binds to the anion-binding
exosite with a dissociation constant of 0.75 µm in the
first step, followed by two intramolecular steps with

exp. opin. invest. drugs (2000) 9(5)

scatena
rate constants of about 300 and 30 per second. similar
results were obtained by witting et al. [4], who further
demonstrated that  xxxd348xxx  is a specific inhibitor of
thrombin forms, with high fibrinogen-procoagulant
activities (alpha- and tau-thrombins) and that its arg-3-pro-4
bond is slowly cleaved by these thrombin forms. for
this situation,  xxxd348xxx  can produce only a labile
complex with thrombin and thereby it causes a
transient and weak inhibition of this protease with
respect to hirudin [5]. moreover,  xxxd348xxx  was
shown to reduce thrombin-induced generation of
plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (pai-1) in cultured
baboon aortic smooth-muscle cells [6].
4.2

in vivo

significant evaluation of the antithrombotic activities
of  xxxd348xxx  can be obtained from the study of kelly
et al. [7], who compared the relative antithrombotic
and antihaemostatic effects of:
• catalytic-site antithrombin peptide,  xxxd1793xxx -pro-arg
• exosite antithrombin peptide, the c-terminal
tyrosine-sulphated dodecapeptide of hirudin
• bifunctional antithrombin peptide  xxxd348xxx  in
baboons
results showed that thrombus formation, measured in
real time as 111i-labeled platelet deposition and
125i-labeled fibrin accumulation, under low flow
conditions, was reduced by half at doses (id50) and
corresponding concentrations (ic 50 ) of 800
nmol/kg/min and 400 nmol/ml for catalytic-site
antithrombin peptide, > 1250 nmol/kg/min and >
1500 µmol/ml for exosite antithrombin peptide and 50
nmol/kg/min and 25 nmol/ml for  xxxd348xxx . under
arterial flow conditions, systemically administered
bifunctional antithrombin peptide decreased
thrombus formation in a dose-dependent manner
id50 and ic50 values of 120 nmol/kg/min and 15
nmol/ml; this dose also produced intermediate inhibition of haemostatic function (bleeding time, 21 ± 3
min vs. 4.5 ± 0.5 min [baseline values]; p < 0.001;
activated partial thromboplastin time, 285 ± 13 sec vs.
31 ± 3 sec [baseline], p < 0.001). in contrast, thrombus
formation within segments of endoarterectomised
aorta was potently decreased by  xxxd348xxx  with an
id50 value of 2.4 nmol/kg/min and an ic50 value of
0.75 nmol/ml, a systemic dose that failed to affect
haemostasis. thus, inhibiting both thrombin’s
catalytic and exosite domains increases antithrombotic potency by several orders of magnitude,

potentiating the inhibition of either domain alone,
particularly at sites of deep arterial injury [6].
the antithrombotic effects of  xxxd348xxx  were well
studied on the rat carotid endoarterectomy model
[6,7]. in one particular study by jackson et al. [7], three
groups of anaesthetised male sprague-dawley rats
received either iv. heparin (10 u/kg bolus followed by
90 u/kg/h, n = 4), high-dose  xxxd348xxx  (0.8 mg/kg
bolus followed by 2.2 mg/kg/h, n = 7), or saline (n =
6) before endoarterectomy and until termination of
the protocol 30 min later. platelet deposition, as
measured by scanning electron microscopy, in rats
receiving the high dose of  xxxd348xxx  was reduced by
63% compared with controls (p = 0.004) and by 36%
compared with heparinised rats (p = 0.07). both
groups had prolonged postsurgical bleeding. infusion
of  xxxd348xxx  at a lower dose (0.4 mg/kg bolus
followed by 1.0 mg/kg/h, n = 8) was not associated
with prolonged bleeding; however, platelet deposition was reduced by only 16% (p = 0.30), although
125i-fibrin deposition was reduced by 64% (p = 0.004).
in the high-dose  xxxd348xxx  group, plasma  xxxd348xxx 
levels, as determined with a quantitative thrombin
time, were three times higher than in the group
receiving the lower  xxxd348xxx  dose (11.6 ± 2.3 µg/ml
vs. 3.9 ± 0.6 µg/ml; p = 0.0022). however, the mean
activated partial thromboplastin time with the higher
dose was similar to that of the lower dose (110 ± 4 vs.
90 ± 13 sec, p = 0.09).

5. pharmacokinetics

and metabolism

fox et al. [10] studied the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd348xxx  at doses ranging from 0.05 - 1 mg/kg
administered as a 15 min iv. infusion, an iv. bolus
injection, or a sc. injection. in this randomised,
placebo-controlled study, the iv. infusion of  xxxd348xxx  over 15 min showed a rapid dose-dependent
prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time
(aptt), prothrombin time (pt) and thrombin time
(tt). interestingly, there was a corresponding
dose-dependent increase in plasma  xxxd348xxx  levels.
the peptide was rapidly cleared with a half-life of 36
min and a total body clearance rate of 0.43 l/kg/h.
similar activity was observed following sc. injection
but with sustained pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic behaviour. after iv. or sc. administration,
maximum urinary excretion was 20%. these data
indicate that metabolic clearance of  xxxd348xxx 
predominates over urinary clearance. moreover,

6.1 phase

efficacy

i studies

fox et al. [10] also studied pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tolerability of  xxxd348xxx  in 54
healthy human volunteers. there was a significant
correlation between pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variables for both iv. (r = 0.8, p < 0.001) and
sc. administration (r = 0.7, p = 0.002). moreover, to
evaluate the possible interactions of aspirin on the
tolerability and anticoagulant activity of iv.  xxxd348xxx , a crossover design was employed in eight
subjects. aspirin administration did not modify the
peptide’s activity. at the administered dose of 0.6
mg/kg/h for 2 h,  xxxd348xxx  infusion prolonged aptt
from 230 - 260% of the baseline. the infusion of  xxxd348xxx  in subjects who had received aspirin was not
associated with any significant changes in the
template bleeding time.
6.2 phase

ii studies

the first phase ii clinical study was the randomisedcontrolled trial of cannon et al. [11], who analysed the
anticoagulant activity of  xxxd348xxx  in patients with
coronary artery disease. in particular, forty-five
patients undergoing cardiac catheterisation, who
were taking aspirin, were randomised to receive
either:
i)  xxxd348xxx , 0.05 mg/kg iv. bolus followed by 0.2
mg/kg/h iv. infusion until the end of the
catheterisation
ii)  xxxd348xxx , 0.15 mg/kg iv. bolus followed by 0.6
mg/kg/h iv. infusion
iii) heparin 5,000 u iv. bolus
serial aptt, pt, activated clotting time (act) and
 xxxg784xxx  were measured.  xxxd348xxx 
produced a dose-dependent prolongation of all
coagulation parameters. the 0.6 mg/kg/h dose
prolonged the aptt to 218% of baseline after 2 min
and 248% of baseline after 15 min. the half-life of the
effect on aptt was 40 min. the  xxxd348xxx  blood
level correlated well with the aptt, pt and act (r =
0.77, 0.73 and 0.82, respectively, all p < 0.001). both
doses of  xxxd348xxx  potently suppressed the generation of  xxxg784xxx  (p < 0.05). there were no

major haemorrhagic, thrombotic or allergic
complications in patients treated with  xxxd348xxx  or
heparin.
topol et al. [12] organised a multicentre dose escalation clinical trial on  xxxd348xxx  to determine its
appropriate dose and feasibility as the sole anticoagulant during coronary angioplasty. for this purpose,
291 patients undergoing elective coronary angioplasty
and pre-treated with 325 mg aspirin daily were
enrolled in sequential groups of intravenously
administered  xxxd348xxx  as follows:
group 1: bolus, 0.15 mg/kg; infusion, 0.6 mg/kg/h
group 2: bolus, 0.25 mg/kg; infusion, 1.0 mg/kg/h
group 3: bolus, 0.35 mg/kg; infusion, 1.4 mg/kg/h
group 4: bolus, 0.45 mg/kg; infusion, 1.8 mg/kg/h
group 5: bolus, 0.55 mg/kg; infusion, 2.2 mg/kg/h
the drug infusion was maintained for 4 h; the primary
end-point was abrupt vessel closure within 24 h of the
initiation of the procedure. act and aptt were
serially monitored. abrupt vessel closure occurred in
18 patients (6.2%). by intention to treat, the abrupt
closure event rate for groups 1 - 3 was 11.3%
compared with 3.9% in groups 4 and 5 (p = 0.052).
there were no significant bleeding complications
except for one patient in group 1, who received a
two-unit transfusion. a dose-response curve of both
acts and aptts was noted; no coronary thrombotic
closures occurred in the small number of patients with
act > 300 sec. interestingly, this study documented
for the first time that it was possible to perform
coronary angioplasty with an anticoagulant other than
heparin in aspirin-pre-treated patients.  xxxd348xxx 
was associated with a rapid onset, dose-dependent
anticoagulant effect, minimal bleeding complications
and at doses of 1.8 - 2.2 mg/kg, a rate of 3.9% for
abrupt vessel closure.
the efficacy of  xxxd348xxx  for the management of ua
was investigated by lidon et al. [13]. patients in the
acute phase of ua (n = 55) received iv.  xxxd348xxx 
according to one of two protocols. in an acute
dose-escalating study, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5
mg/kg/h were infused in 15 patients, each for 30 min.
prolongation of aptt (r = 0.95),  xxxg784xxx 
inhibition (r = 0.96) and  xxxd348xxx  plasma levels (r =
0.91) correlated closely with the dose infused, with
significant changes compared with baseline
appearing at doses of ≥ 0.25 mg/kg/h. the purposes
of the second protocol were to determine whether the
exp. opin. invest. drugs (2000) 9(5)

scatena
anticoagulant and antithrombotic effects of the drug
were sustained during a 72 hour infusion and to assess
whether such treatment prevented the complications
of ua. based on the initial study, a dose of 0.25
mg/kg/h was given to each patient until two patients
failed therapy, then successively higher doses until a
95% success rate was achieved or adverse effects
intervened, increasing the dose after two failures had
occurred at each level. five patients received the 0.25
mg/kg/h dose and 14 received 0.5 mg/kg/h before
two failures occurred. failure was observed in only
one of 21 patients at the dose of 1 mg/kg/h. aptt
levels increased to 62, 76 and 98 sec, respectively at
the three doses, with minimal intra-individual
variation;  xxxd348xxx  plasma levels were measured at
1050, 2100 and 4200 mg/ml, respectively.  xxxg784xxx  plasma levels decreased at all doses but more
consistently at the dose of 1 mg/kg/h. the overall
clinical success rate was 87.5%: calculated as 60%
(3/5) at the low dose, 86% (12/14) at the intermediate
dose and 95% (20/21) at the high dose. in an
open-label pilot study of 20 patients with ua
(braunwald class i-iiib), sharma et al. [14] showed
similar positive results with  xxxd348xxx  administered
as a continuous iv. infusion for five days at a dose of
0.2 mg/kg/h producing an aptt of approximately
200% of control.
the role of  xxxd348xxx  as adjunctive therapy to
thrombolisis was investigated by lidon et al. [15],
who, in a randomised controlled clinical trial,
evaluated the benefit of  xxxd348xxx  as adjunct therapy
to streptokinase to enhance early patency and prevent
re-thrombosis. forty-five patients were randomised to
 xxxd348xxx  or heparin (2:1 ratio). coronary
angiography documented a timi (thrombin inhibition in myocardial infarction) 2 or 3 flow after 90 min
in 77% of the patients treated with  xxxd348xxx  and
streptokinase and in 47% of patients treated with
heparin and streptokinase (p < 0.05) and after 120 min
in 87% and 47% of patients, respectively (p < 0.01).
timi 3 flow was established in 77% of patients with
 xxxd348xxx  compared with 40% with heparin (p <
0.02). the clinical outcome and the bleeding rate
were also favourable to  xxxd348xxx ; no re-occlusion
was observed at late angiography performed 4.7 days
later. considering these data,  xxxd348xxx  significantly
improved the early patency rate of the infarct-related
artery with a favourable clinical profile.
similar results were obtained by theroux et al. [16]
who adopted a double-blind randomised protocol to
investigate the potential of  xxxd348xxx  as adjunctive

therapy to streptokinase to promote early patency of
infarct-related artery. in this study angiographic
patency of the culprit coronary artery lesion was
assessed 90 and 120 min after the initiation of
streptokinase and aspirin and again after 4 ± 2 days in
68 patients with acute myocardial infarction. patients
were randomised to  xxxd348xxx  0.5 mg/kg/h for 12 h
followed by 0.1 mg/kg/h (low dose),  xxxd348xxx  1.0
mg/kg/h for 12 h followed by placebo (high dose), or
to heparin 5000 u bolus followed by 1000 u/h titrated
to an aptt 2 - 2.5 times control after 12 h. at 90 min,
timi flow grade 2 or 3 was observed in 96% of
patients treated with the low dose of  xxxd348xxx , in
79% with the high dose and in 46% with heparin (p =
0.006) and timi flow grade 3 was observed in 85%,
61% and 31% of patients, respectively (p = 0.008). at
120 min, these figures were 100%, 82% and 62% for
timi flow grades 2 and 3 (p = 0.046) and 92%, 68%
and 46% for timi flow grade 3 (p = 0.014).  xxxd348xxx 
yields higher early patency rates in the culprit
coronary artery than heparin, when used as adjunctive therapy to streptokinase and aspirin in the early
phase of acute myocardial infarction. intriguingly,
high doses could be less effective than lower doses,
which suggests that too much thrombin inhibition
may be harmful.
finally, phase ii open-label studies were realised to
validate the potential efficacy and safety of  xxxd348xxx 
in the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (dvt) in
orthopaedic patients. in particular, ginsberg et al.
[17,18] in a dose-escalating design, studied 222
patients undergoing major hip or knee surgery.
subcutaneous  xxxd348xxx  was initiated postoperatively. patients were evaluated for bleeding and
symptomatic pulmonary embolism and mandatory
bilateral venography was performed before
discharge. dose escalations were made on the basis of
observed rates of bleeding and venous thrombosis.
there were five dosage regimens used: 0.3 mg/kg
every 12 h, 0.6 mg/kg every 12 h, 1.0 mg/kg every 12 h
for three days followed by 0.6 mg/kg every 12 h for up
to 11 days, 1.0 mg/kg every 12 h and 1.0 mg/kg every
8 h. one hundred and seventy-seven patients who
had technically adequate bilateral venography or
objectively documented pulmonary embolism were
included in the primary analysis of efficacy. the
highest dosage regimen (1.0 mg/kg every 8 h)
provided the lowest rates of total dvt (17%) and
proximal dvt (2%), both of which were significantly
lower (p = 0.010 and p = 0.023, respectively) than the
pooled rates of total (43%) and proximal (20%) dvt

1124  xxxd348xxx : a new generation antithrombotic drug
seen with the first four regimens. bleeding rates were
low (< 5%) with all regimens. interestingly, this study
demonstrated that 1.0 mg/kg  xxxd348xxx  every 8 h
started postoperatively is potentially efficacious and
safe for the prevention of dvt after major hip or knee
surgery.
6.3

phase iii studies

bittl et al. [20,21] studied the efficacy and safety profile
of  xxxd348xxx  compared with heparin in a randomised, double-blind trial in 4312 patients undergoing
angioplasty for unstable or post-infarction angina. in
the total study group,  xxxd348xxx  did not significantly
reduce the incidence of the primary end-point (death
in the hospital, mi, abrupt vessel closure, rapid clinical
deterioration of cardiac origin; 11.4% vs. 12.2% for
heparin) but it did result in a lower incidence of
bleeding (3.8% vs. 9.8%, p < 0.001). interestingly, in a
prospectively stratified subgroup of 704 patients with
post-infarction angina,  xxxd348xxx  therapy resulted in
a lower incidence of the primary end-point (9.1% vs.
14.2%, p = 0.04) and a lower incidence of bleeding
(3.0% vs. 11.1%, p < 0.001), but in a similar cumulative
rate of death, mi and repeated revascularisation in the
six months after angioplasty (20.5% vs. 25.1%, p =
0.17). in conclusion,  xxxd348xxx  was at least as
effective as high-dose heparin in preventing
ischaemic complications in patients who underwent
angioplasty for ua and it carried a lower risk of
bleeding.  xxxd348xxx , as compared with heparin,
reduced the risk of immediate ischaemic complications in patients with post-infarction angina, but this
difference was no longer apparent after six months.
these results were confirmed by other studies on the
same groups of patients [21,22]. interestingly, an
intent-to-treat analysis using adjudicated data for the
pre-specified group of 741 patients who underwent
angioplasty within two weeks of documented
myocardial infarction [23] showed positive results
regarding the use of  xxxd348xxx . in particular,  xxxd348xxx  significantly (p = 0.004) decreased the incidence
of procedural failure compared with heparin (5.1% vs.
10.8%). moreover, the incidence of major bleeding
was significantly lower in  xxxd348xxx -treated patients
compared with heparin-treated patients (2.4% vs.
11.8%, respectively; p = 0.001).
timi 7 trial was a randomised, double-blind study on
 xxxd348xxx , given with 325 mg/d aspirin to 410
patients with ua [24]. patients received a constant
infusion of  xxxd348xxx  for 72 h at one of four doses:

0.02, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/h. the primary efficacy
end-point was ‘unsatisfactory outcome,’ defined as
death, non-fatal mi, rapid clinical deterioration, or
recurrent ischaemic pain at rest with ecg changes by
72 h. unsatisfactory outcome was similar among the
four dose groups: 8.1%, 6.2%, 11.4% and 6.2% (p =
ns). however, the secondary end-point of death or
non-fatal mi through hospital discharge occurred in
10.0% of patients treated with 0.02 mg/kg/h
compared with 3.2% of patients treated with the three
higher doses of  xxxd348xxx  (0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/h,
p = 0.008). only 2 of 410 patients (0.5%) experienced
a major haemorrhage attributed to  xxxd348xxx . the
results of timi 7 lend support to the use of an
antithrombin agent with aspirin in patients with
unstable angina.
hero (hirulog early reperfusion/occlusion) trial
was a randomised, double-blind comparison study of
 xxxd348xxx  versus heparin in patients receiving
streptokinase and aspirin for acute mi [26]. patients
presenting within 12 h with st-segment elevation (n =
412) were given aspirin and streptokinase and
randomised to receive up to 60 h of either heparin
(5000 u bolus followed by 1000 - 1200 u/h), low-dose
 xxxd348xxx  (0.125 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.25
mg/kg/h for 12 h then 0.125 mg/kg/h), or high-dose
 xxxd348xxx  (0.25 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.5
mg/kg/h for 12 h then 0.25 mg/kg/h). the primary
outcome was timi trial grade 3 flow of the infarctrelated artery at 90 - 120 min. timi 3 flow was 35%
with heparin, 46% with low-dose  xxxd348xxx  and 48%
with high-dose  xxxd348xxx  (heparin versus  xxxd348xxx , p = 0.023; heparin versus high-dose  xxxd348xxx ,
p = 0.03). at 48 h, re-occlusion had occurred in 7% of
heparin, 5% of low-dose  xxxd348xxx  and 1% of
high-dose  xxxd348xxx  patients (p = ns). by 35 days,
death, cardiogenic shock, or re-infarction had
occurred in 25 (17.9%) heparin, 19 (14%) low-dose
 xxxd348xxx  and 17 (12.5%) high-dose  xxxd348xxx 
patients (p = ns). two strokes occurred with heparin,
none with low-dose  xxxd348xxx  and two with
high-dose  xxxd348xxx . major bleeding (40% from the
groin site) occurred in 28% of heparin, 14% of
low-dose  xxxd348xxx  and 19% of high-dose  xxxd348xxx  patients (heparin versus low-dose  xxxd348xxx , p
< 0.01). results clearly showed that  xxxd348xxx  was
more effective than heparin in producing early
patency in patients treated with aspirin and streptokinase without increasing the risk of major bleeding.

7. safety

and tolerability

phase i [10] and phase ii [11-15] clinical studies
showed no major haemorrhagic, thrombotic or
allergic complications in patients treated with  xxxd348xxx . in general,  xxxd348xxx  demonstrated to have a
well-tolerated anticoagulant profile.
phase iii multicentre clinical trials showed that
compared to heparin,  xxxd348xxx  therapy was associated with either equivalent or lower rates of side
effects [20-25]. in particular, bittl et al. [21] showed that
side effects of  xxxd348xxx  and heparin were related to
haemorrhagic complications such as intravascular
puncture site haemorrhage (29.1% vs. 61.6%; p <
0.001), haematuria (16.6% vs. 20.6%; p = 0.001),
bleeding requiring red cell transfusion (3.7% vs. 8.6%;
p < 0.001), or haematemesis (0.8% vs. 1.9%; p = 0.001).
8. regulatory

affairs

in october 1999,  xxxd348xxx  ( xxxd348xxx ) received
marketing clearance for use as anticoagulant in
patients undergoing coronary angioplasty in new
zealand. moreover, the drug is currently under regulatory review for marketing approval by both the us
fda and the emea.
interestingly, in october 1998 the us fda’s cardiovascular and renal drugs advisory committee did not
approve use of  xxxd348xxx  as anticoagulant in patients
undergoing ptca. this decision depended on the
failure of  xxxd348xxx  to meet the primary end-point of
phase iii studies (superiority of  xxxd348xxx  over
heparin with respect to procedural failure for patients
undergoing ptca) [27].
9. conclusion
considering the fundamental role of thrombin in
arterial thrombogenesis, most therapeutic strategies
for acs are aimed at inhibiting its generation or
blocking its activity. although heparin has been
widely used, it has limitations in the setting of arterial
thrombosis. these limitations depend on the inability
of heparin to inactivate thrombin bound to fibrin, a
major stimulus for thrombus growth. in addition, the
anticoagulant response to heparin varies from patient
to patient and heparin is neutralised by platelet factor
iv, large quantities of which are released from
platelets activated at sites of plaque rupture.
consequently, heparin requires careful laboratory

monitoring to ensure an adequate anticoagulant
effect. direct thrombin inhibitors, such as  xxxd348xxx ,
could overcome the limitations of heparin. this agent
inhibits fibrin-bound thrombin, as well as fluid-phase
thrombin and produces a predictable anticoagulant
response. moreover,  xxxd348xxx  should have a wider
therapeutic window than heparin because  xxxd348xxx 
only transiently inhibits the active site of thrombin
[28-32].
however, results of phase iii clinical trials are not so
positive in terms of costs/efficacy and further studies
are needed to assess the real value of this direct
thrombin inhibitor. on these bases, the medicines
company planned a new series of phase ii and iii
clinical studies. the pk/pd study is an ongoing phase
ii trial that is studying the pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics of  xxxd348xxx  in renally impaired
patients undergoing ptca.
the ticlopidine interaction clinical trial is a multicentre
phase ii study realised to determine the pharmacological or potential clinical interaction of ticlopidine
and  xxxd348xxx  when administered concomitantly in
patients undergoing ptca.
atbat 1st inning clinical trial is an ongoing phase ii
study planned to establish the safety of  xxxd348xxx  in
patients undergoing pci who are unable to tolerate
heparin.
the hero 2 phase iii trial, which began in december
1998, examines 17,000 acute mi patients who are
eligible for thrombolytic therapy. patients are
randomised and treated with streptokinase in addition
to either  xxxd348xxx  or heparin [29].
the cachet trial is an ongoing 5000 patients study
which examine the effects of different doses of  xxxd348xxx  used in combination with centocor’s  xxxd53xxx 
(reopro) in patients undergoing percutaneous
coronary interventions [30].
10. expert

opinion

until now the results of clinical studies and in
particular results of large phase iii multicentre clinical
trials in acs and related medical procedures has
demonstrated that  xxxd348xxx  is at least as effective as
heparin, with clearly superior safety [32]. this
statement indicates a low ratio efficacy/costs for
 xxxd348xxx  in comparison with heparin. however,
some proper physiopathological remarks should be
stressed:

• thrombin has several fundamental functions in
blood clotting, subsequent clot lysis and tissue
repair
• thrombin covers a significant role in oedema,
inflammation, cell recruitment, cellular releases,
transformations, mitogenesis and angiogenesis.
• for these molecular mechanisms thrombin participates in different diseases, such as venous
thrombosis, coronary thrombosis, stroke and
pulmonary emboli and is implicated in atherosclerosis, the growth and metastasis of certain cancers.

considering acs, these pharmacological statements
seem to indicate that dosages usually adopted for
 xxxd348xxx  do not permit an optimal antithrombotic
activity. for these conditions, dosage and duration of
therapy with  xxxd348xxx  should be partially increased.
moreover to bypass amplification and redundancy
related to pathological haemostasis, a multi-tiered
strategy with thrombin inhibitors, antiplatelets and
plasminogen activators could be necessary. at last, it
could be useful to further evaluate a sc. route of
administration to facilitate  xxxd348xxx  use in the
well-known cardiovascular indications and to enlarge
the therapeutic profile of the drug (inflammation
states, wound healing, angiogenesis/malignancy).

in conclusion,  xxxd348xxx  can be considered as a new
generation antithrombotic drug due to its unusual
biochemical and pharmacological properties.
however, its therapeutic potential in different
diseases depends on a more accurate evaluation of its
phar macokinetics and phar macodynamics
parameters.
