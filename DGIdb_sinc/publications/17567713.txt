first published june 13, 2007; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00286.2007.—
throughout the world many people use artificial sweeteners (as) for
the purpose of reducing caloric intake. the most prominently used of
these molecules include saccharin,  xxxd232xxx  ( xxxd232xxx ), acesulfame-k, and cyclamate. despite the caloric advantage they provide,
one key concern in their use is their aversive aftertaste that has been
characterized on a sensory level as bitter and/or metallic. recently, it
has been shown that the activation of particular t2r bitter taste
receptors is partially involved with the bitter aftertaste sensation of
saccharin and acesulfame-k. to more fully understand the biology
behind these phenomena we have addressed the question of whether
as could stimulate transient receptor potential  xxxd428xxx -1 (trpv1)
receptors, as these receptors are activated by a large range of structurally different chemicals. moreover, trpv1 receptors and/or their
variants are found in taste receptor cells and in nerve terminals
throughout the oral cavity. hence, trpv1 activation could be involved in the as aftertaste or even contribute to the poorly understood
metallic taste sensation. using ca2⫹ imaging on trpv1 receptors
heterologously expressed in the human embryonic kidney (hek) 293
cells and on dissociated primary sensory neurons, we find that in both
systems, as activate trpv1 receptors, and, moreover, they sensitize
these channels to acid and heat. we also found that trpv1 receptors
are activated by cuso4, znso4, and feso4, three salts known to
produce a metallic taste sensation. in summary, our results identify a
novel group of compounds that activate trpv1 and, consequently,
provide a molecular mechanism that may account for off tastes of
sweeteners and metallic tasting salts.

sweeteners (as) represent a major
dietary supplement. their consumption is involved with weight
management, prevention of dental decay, and for diabetics the
control of blood glucose. saccharin,  xxxd232xxx , and acesulfame-k are among the most commonly used as. cyclamate,
although currently not approved for use in the united states, is
used in more than 50 countries worldwide. unlike sucrose,
these compounds are not perceived to be sweet at all concentrations. in fact, for all these compounds, as concentration
increases, the taste perception shifts from pleasant (sweet)
toward unpleasant (bitter/metallic) (10, 12, 41). this shift has
been explained by the activation at low concentrations of sweet
tastant-sensing g protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs)  xxxg2249xxx /
t1r3 (23) and at higher concentrations, the activation of the

bitter tastant sensing gpcrs, t2r43, and t2r44 for saccharin
and acesulfame-k (21). other taste sensations related to the
aftertaste elicited by artificial sweeteners have been attributed
to their diffusion into taste receptor cells where they can alter
intracellular signaling pathways (37, 38, 40, 57). a recent
psychophysical study showed that it is sometimes difficult to
distinguish between the bitterness caused by quinine and the
irritating sensation produced by capsaicin, the principal pungent ingredient in chili peppers that activates trpv1 receptors
(24). this result suggests that some of the bitter taste sensation
may involve the activation of capsaicin-sensitive trpv1 receptors.
trpv1 receptors or their variants are present in taste receptor cells (trcs) and in sensory neurons in the mouth (15),
where they are activated by acidic and thermal stimuli (5, 30,
51), as well as a wide range of molecules that include vanilloids, alcohols, terpenoids, aldehydes, and lipids. vanilloids
include capsaicin from chili pepper,  xxxd3101xxx  from cactus
resin (49), zingerone and gingerol from ginger (7, 28), and
eugenol from cloves (55). trpv1 receptors were also found to
be activated by nonvanilloid plant-derived molecules like camphor (54), by the fungal extract scutigeral, and by piperine
from black pepper (27, 36, 48). other trpv1 ligands include
ethanol (1–3%), (52), reducing agents such as dithiothreitol
(53), and certain 1,4 dialdehydes (e.g., isovelleral) (47). endogenous trpv1 ligands include molecules such as anandamide, n- xxxd209xxx , and eicosanoids (13, 14, 46, 59).
peptide toxins from tarantula venom also activate trpv1
receptors (45). as the capsaicin binding site is on the cytoplasmic surface of trpv1 (17, 18), all of these organic molecules
must either be synthesized intracellularly or be able to permeate into the lingual epithelia, where they could diffuse into
trcs (40, 57, 58) or nerve terminals (4, 15) and eventually
activate trpv1 receptors.
trpv1 receptors have also been shown to be directly
activated on the extracellular side by high concentrations of
ca2⫹ and mg2⫹ (1). at the sensory level, the taste perception
of these two minerals is very close and was described as
primarily bitter with additional sensations such as salty, metallic, astringent, sour and sweet qualities (25, 43). in addition
to as, metallic taste can be strongly elicited by metal salts
containing zinc, iron and copper (22, 25, 56). consequently,
we explored whether trpv1 receptors would be activated by
these metallic salts and thus contribute to some of their gustatory sensations.

artificial sweeteners stimulate trpv1

to rationalize the off-tastes of the as, we tested whether
they could act on the somatosensory system by targeting
trpv1 receptors. in summary, we found that trpv1 receptors are activated by both as and selected metal salts
and therefore can have a role in their irritating and metallic
aftertaste perceptions.
materials and methods

chemicals. capsaicin, saccharin,  xxxd232xxx , acesulfame-k, sodium
cyclamate (fig. 1), capsazepine, sucrose, sb-366791, and ruthenium
red were obtained from sigma-aldrich (buchs, switzerland). stock
solutions in dmso were prepared: 1 mm capsaicin, 33 mm sb366791, 33 mm capsazepine, and 1 m saccharin, which were kept at
4°c. when added to cells, the final concentration of dmso was
⬍0.1% (vol/vol) for capsaicin, sb-366791, and capsazepine and was
⬍0.2% (vol/vol) for saccharin. caso4,  xxxd2534xxx , cuso4, znso4, and
feso4 were obtained from sigma-aldrich. bitter tasting molecules
caffeine, theophylline, salicin, 6-n- xxxd3036xxx ,  xxxd2923xxx , quinine-hcl, and ␤-glucopyranoside, which were also obtained from sigma-aldrich, were dissolved in buffer. all molecules
were diluted with buffer to their final concentration.
cloning and expression of human trpv1, transient receptor potential ankyrin 1, transient receptor potential melastatin 8. a human
trpv1 expression construct was prepared from a cdna clone
obtained from rzpd (german resource center for genome research, berlin, germany). following the manufacturer’s instructions,
the gene was cloned into pcdna5/frt (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca)
and confirmed by sequencing. to obtain the insertion of the trpv1
expression cassette by flp recombination, hek 293 cells containing
a recombination site (flp-in system; invitrogen) were cotransfected
with htrpv1-pcdna5/frt and pog44 using lipofectamine. stable
clones expressing trpv1 were selected using hygromycin antibiotic
selection, and colonies were expanded to obtain a large stock of
trpv1-expressing cells. trpv1 protein expression was confirmed
by western blot analysis (positive band at 85 kda). human transient
receptor potential ankyrin 1 (trpa1) and transient receptor potential
melastatin 8 ( xxxg2334xxx ) cdna clones were obtained from origene
technologies (rockville, md) and were transiently transfected in
hek 293 cells using lipofectamine 2000 (invitrogen).
hek cell culture. hek 293 cells were grown as monolayers in
dmem (sigma) supplemented with nonessential amino acids, 10%

fbs, 2 mm l-glutamine and maintained at 37°c under 95% o2-5%
co2. htrpv1-expressing cells were cultured with the antibiotic
hygromycin. cells were passaged every 3 or 4 days, and the highest
passage number used was 14 for trpv1-expressing cells and 20 for
nontransfected cells. capsaicin sensitivity in htrpv1-expressing
cells was assessed by imaging intracellular ca2⫹ concentration (see
below) and used as a control for trpv1 expression.
measurement of intracellular calcium levels [ca2⫹]i using a fluorescent plate reader. trpv1-, trpa1-,  xxxg2334xxx -expressing cells and
nontransfected cells were seeded into 96-well plates (costar, high
wycombe, uk) coated with poly-d-lysine at a density of ⬃100,000
cells per well in supplemented dmem and cultured overnight. cells
were then incubated at room temperature for 20 min with hank’s
 xxxd2988xxx  (hbss) supplemented with 2 mm cacl2 and 20
mm hepes, containing the cytoplasmic calcium indicator 2 ␮m
fura-2/am (molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca) and 0.04% pluronic
acid (molecular devices). the cells were washed once and resuspended in the same hbss buffer before being incubated for 25 min at
room temperature with either hbss buffer alone or containing the
trpv1 antagonist capsazepine (10 ␮m). the 96-well plates were
then placed into the plate reader (␭ex1 ⫽ 340 nm, ␭ex2 ⫽ 380 nm,
␭em ⫽ 508 nm), and fura-2 ratios (f340/f380) were recorded to
quantify the changes in [ca2⫹]i upon stimulation with as and metallic
salts. solutions of agonists in hbss at ph 7.4 were applied at
different concentrations after 12 s and were not removed during the
recording. the metallic salts acidified the hbss ph for concentrations
superior to 20 mm from ph 7.4 to 5.5.
all experiments were conducted at 37°c except trpa1 and
 xxxg2334xxx  ligand assays, which were performed at room temperature
(22°c), the acid potentiation experiments, which were also performed
at 22°c, and the temperature variation experiments (fig. 4). in the ph
variation experiments, the solutions in which ph was adjusted with
hcl were applied on the cells immersed in a small volume of buffer
at ph 7.4. the final ph of the solutions at 25°c was measured using
a ph meter (methrom, herisau, switzerland) in separate vials. in the
temperature variation experiments, the agonists’ solutions were equilibrated at each temperature and applied on the cells that where
incubated in a small volume of hbss at 22°c.
responses to molecules were expressed as a percentage of the
maximum response evoked by 1 ␮m capsaicin at 37°c (under these
conditions 1 ␮m was independently assessed to be a saturating
concentration). for all experiments, the peak response was taken to be
the characteristic value. data were analyzed using softmax pro
software (molecular devices). dose-response curves and ec50 values
were calculated using the hill equation (graphpad prism software,
san diego, ca). the hill equation was calculated as

f340/f380 remained stable. the projected soma diameters (␮m) were
measured with a calibrated eyepiece under phase contrast illumination. traces were recorded from neurons with soma diameters ranging
between 18 and 30 ␮m.
coverslips with attached neurons were placed in a flow chamber
with continuous flow of supplemented hbss. chemical stimuli
present in hbss were applied at 30 –33°c to the flow chamber for
30 s, and cells were rinsed 2 or 3 min in hbss between stimuli. for
each neuron the average fluorescence ratio f340/f380 was calculated
using metafluor software (universal imaging; molecular devices). in
the sb-366791 antagonism experiments, neurons were first exposed to
saccharin (or  xxxd232xxx ) followed by a 2-min wash with hbss.
subsequently, sb366791 was perfused for 1 min, with saccharin (or
 xxxd232xxx ) addition over the last 30 s. after 2-min wash, saccharin (or
 xxxd232xxx ) and capsaicin were added sequentially. neurons were
finally washed with buffer, and then kcl (50 mm) was added to verify
neuronal activity. between 225 and 250 neurons were analyzed in 15
separate experiments, and each observation shown in fig. 5 was made
at least in triplicate.

as activate trpv1 in a dose-dependent manner but not

trpv1 receptors heterologously expressed in hek 293 cells

sensitive trp receptors, we recorded from hek cells with
expressed trpa1 or  xxxg2334xxx  receptors. as expected, trpa1and  xxxg2334xxx -expressing cells were responsive to their specific
ligands, cinnamaldehyde and allyl isothiocyanate for trpa1
and menthol for  xxxg2334xxx , respectively (3, 16, 35, 39), but at
room temperature they were insensitive to as (not shown).
moreover, to rule out involvement of bitter taste transduction
pathways, we tested 5 mm caffeine, 10 mm theophylline, 10
mm salicin, 1 mm 6-n- xxxd3036xxx , 1 mm  xxxd2923xxx , 0.1 mm quinine-hcl, and 10 mm ␤-glucopyranoside.
none of these bitter tasting molecules elicited a specific response in cells transfected with trpv1 and only quinine-hcl
resulted in  xxxd232xxx  ca2⫹ mobilization in both transfected and
nontransfected cells (not shown).
shown in fig. 2 are typical responses evoked near maximal
concentrations of saccharin (2 mm; sac),  xxxd232xxx  (8 mm;
asp), na-cyclamate (25 mm; nacyc) and acesulfame-k (25
mm; acek). in the trpv1-expressing cells, the application of
1 ␮m capsaicin evoked a transient increase in [ca2⫹]i that was
characterized by a relatively rapid initial onset and a peak
occurring about 16 s after injection. like capsaicin, the responses to saccharin and  xxxd232xxx  did not markedly desensitize in 30 s, whereas the responses to nacyc and acek
desensitized. the initial slope of the fluorescence change for
the as is less steep than that found for capsaicin, and their
maximal intensities were both smaller than for capsaicin and
different from each other. moreover, all four of the as tested
have a longer onset latency (time between compound injection
and maximum induced response) than 1 ␮m capsaicin.
the initial decrease shown in the response to 8 mm  xxxd232xxx  arose at this high injected concentration by an increase in
light scattering caused by small aggregates that reduced the
fluorescence. however, the response increased to normal values once the  xxxd232xxx  diffused throughout the chamber.
moreover, at lower concentrations, the transient decrease in
light scattering was not observed.
trpv1-expressing cells respond to all four as in a dosedependent manner (fig. 3a). responses of sac (0.1–2 mm),
asp (0.5–9 mm), nacyc (1–25 mm), and acek (1–50 mm)
were measured as the peak increase in fluorescence, expressed
relative to the maximum 1 ␮m capsaicin response. these data
were then fitted using the hill equation. the highest concentration used for each as was established either because of
curve saturation, as observed for sac, or a trpv1-independent
ca2⫹ influx (asp), or by the contribution of the na⫹ or k⫹
counter-ions in nacyc and acek, respectively. for nacyc and
acek, the counter-cation influence was assessed using solutions of nacl and kcl, respectively, having the equivalent
na⫹ or k⫹ concentrations. below 25 mm, nacl did not elicit
a ca2⫹ influx (fig. 3a), whereas 25 mm kcl induced a
significant increase in [ca2⫹]i. from this result, it is evident
that the influence of the k⫹ ion in the acek prevented an
accurate calculation of an ec50 value.
to characterize further whether trpv1 is specifically
activated by as, we challenged the as activation with 10
␮m capsazepine (cpz), a trpv1-antagonist. we found that
as activation was essentially eliminated in the presence of
cpz (fig. 3b). in the presence of 10 ␮m cpz, we found that
the response to 1 ␮m capsaicin was inhibited by about 70%.
we also observed that natural membrane impermanent sweet
tastants, such as sucrose at high concentrations (100 mm)

artificial sweeteners sensitize the thermal and acid response
of trpv1 receptors. in the absence of capsaicin and in a ph
7.4 buffer, trpv1 channels are activated at ⬃42°c (5). in the
presence of capsaicin (or at lower phs), the activation temperature decreases (51). here, we tested whether as, like capsaicin, would also increase the thermal sensitivity of trpv1
(fig. 4a). saccharin and  xxxd232xxx  were selected to explore
their effect on the thermal responses of both transfected (with
trpv1) and untransfected hek 293 cells, as they are the most
potent and structurally different trpv1 activators (fig. 3). at

each particular incubation temperature (22°c to 48°c with
intervals of 2–5°c), heated buffer was added to trpv1 cells to
induce a temperature jump. in nontransfected cells with either
buffer alone or in the presence of 2 mm sac or 8 mm asp, no
increase in ca2⫹ was monitored. in transfected cells, an abrupt
increase in ca2⫹ influx was observed at about 42°c, whereupon it monotonically increased with temperature to 48°c. it is
seen that in the presence of saccharin or  xxxd232xxx , there is no
obvious break in the fluorescence-temperature relationship;
moreover, at virtually every temperature, including 37°c (vertical dotted line), the fluorescence was greater than it was in the
absence of these agonists. these data suggest that, like capsaicin, at physiological temperatures, trpv1 receptors are sensitized by saccharin and  xxxd232xxx . as controls, we found no
temperature-dependent increase in ca2⫹ was evoked in nontransfected cells with either buffer alone or in the presence of
2 mm sac or 8 mm asp.
another important activator of trpv1 are protons. moreover, in the presence of capsaicin and elevated temperatures,
the sensitivity to protons increases (5, 51). to further characterize synergies between as and other known trpv1 ligands,
we tested the influence of ph on the potency of saccharin and
 xxxd232xxx . indeed, we found that the addition of 2 mm sac or
8 mm asp shifted the half-maximal activation of the ph curve
from 6 to 6.13 for 2 mm sac and from 6 to 6.2 for 8 mm asp.
in addition, as potentiated the maximum induced ph response
and increased the hill coefficients (fig. 4b).
sensory neurons are selectively activated by artificial sweeteners. to address whether as would stimulate native trpv1containing cells, we imaged [ca2⫹]i of acutely dissociated
drg neurons in their presence. we choose neurons with
small- to medium-diameter somas (⬍30 ␮m), as they were
likely nociceptors that contain trpv1 (5). we found that the
application of 500 nm capsaicin evoked significant increases in
[ca2⫹]i for 89 of the 225 neurons tested (fig. 5).

as shown in fig. 5b, 2 mm saccharin evoked [ca2⫹]i
transients, albeit exclusively in the drg neurons that were
capsaicin sensitive. the capsaicin-insensitive population of
neurons only responded to 50 mm kcl (fig. 5, a and b).
similar results were found for 8 mm  xxxd232xxx  (fig. 5c). cells
that responded to sac, asp, and nacyc also responded to
subsequent application of 500 nm cap, whereas capsaicininsensitive cells did not respond to any of these as (fig. 5b).
the activation of capsaicin-sensitive neurons by capsaicin or
as was blocked by preincubation with 10 ␮m sb-366791, a
highly specific trpv1 antagonist (9) (fig. 5, a–c). however,
after washing sb-366791 away, ligand-evoked responses
could be recovered, and moreover, the capsaicin-sensitive
neurons were again responsive to subsequent applications of
saccharin (or  xxxd232xxx ) and capsaicin (fig. 5, b and c).
neurons that did not respond to either sweeteners or capsaicin
were found to be responsive to kcl.
the capsaicin-sensitive neurons also responded to acek
(fig. 5d). all neurons responding to kcl were activated by
acek, even those insensitive to capsaicin, which is likely due
to the depolarizing activity of k⫹. however, capsaicin-sensitive cells responded faster and with a larger amplitude than the
other cells, indicating the importance of the acesulfame anion
for trpv1 activation process.
selected metal salts directly gate trpv1 expressed in hek
293 cells. another category of molecules that exhibit an
unpleasant “off-taste” are the salts cuso4, znso4, and feso4
(25). here, we tested whether like as, they could activate
trpv1 receptors. all three salts increased [ca2⫹]i levels in
trpv1-expressing cells but did not in nontransfected cells
(fig. 6a). the increase in intracellular calcium was not dosedependent, most likely because these salts will form complexes
in solutions like hbss, and consequently, they do not behave
as completely dissociated ions (34). for example, with increasing concentrations, the responses to cuso4 first augmented,

reached a maximum  xxxd1891xxx  mm, and then monotonically decreased. the same pattern was observed for feso4 and znso4
even though they induced a smaller ca2⫹ increase. using
whole cell patch-clamp, ahern et al. (1) showed in trpv1
receptors expressed in hek 293 cells that caso4 and  xxxd2534xxx 
salts activate the receptor in a concentration-dependent manner, most likely because these salts are almost completely
dissociated. using measurements of intracellular calcium, we
have obtained similar results to ahern et al. (1) with calcium
and magnesium salts (fig. 6a). to further demonstrate that
these salts activate trpv1, we found that they all were
completely inhibited by 10 ␮m ruthenium red, a trpv1
antagonist (fig. 6b). we also found that with exception of 10
mm cuso4, 10 ␮m cpz also inhibited the responses to the
others salts (not shown). metal salts were also applied on
trpa1- and  xxxg2334xxx - expressing cells but no response was
monitored.
discussion

the low caloric artificial sweeteners saccharin,  xxxd232xxx ,
acesulfame-k, and cyclamate are widely used as a food supplement. however, increasing concentrations of all these compounds shift their sensory attributes from sweet, via activation
of t1rs, to an unpleasant long-lasting taste sensation comprising bitter and metallic components. although the bitter comajp-regul integr comp physiol • vol

r631

ponent can be partially accounted for by the activation of
specific t2rs, the molecular mechanisms of these other taste
sensations are poorly understood. to this point, we found that
as and salts that produce a metallic taste are effective agonists
for the human trpv1 receptor. as capsaicin-sensitive trpv1
receptors are expressed in nociceptive sensory neurons and
taste cells, our results not only present a novel class of ligands
for trpv1 channels but also provide a molecular connection
that can rationalize the “off tastes” associated with the artificial
sweeteners.
artificial sweeteners activate trpv1 receptors. we have
obtained unequivocal evidence that the four most commonly
used as (saccharin,  xxxd232xxx , acesulfame-k and sodium
cyclamate) activate trpv1 receptors. in particular, we found
all four as activated trpv1 receptors in a dose-dependent
manner (fig. 3). in nontransfected hek 293 cells, as either
did not evoke a response or evoked responses that could be
accounted for by an increase in kcl concentration (see below
for acek). further evidence that as activate trpv1 channels
is that their responses were largely inhibited by cpz (fig. 3b).
moreover, like capsaicin, as were found to sensitize trpv1
responses to heat (fig. 4a) and acidic stimuli (fig. 4b). indeed,
the sensitization to thermal stimuli suggests that trpv1 receptors would be active at physiological temperatures in the
mouth (34 –37°c) (fig. 4).
in primary sensory neurons, we found that neurons that are
responsive to capsaicin (nociceptive) are also responsive to as
(fig. 6). moreover, the as-evoked responses were inhibited by
sb366791, a selective trpv1 antagonist (9).
for heterologously expressed trpv1 channels, acesulfame-k was able to induce an increase of [ca2⫹]i superior to
and independent from the k⫹-induced activation (fig. 3a).
this behavior correlates well with the ca2⫹ imaging experiments on drg neurons in which one subpopulation of neurons
was sensitive to capsaicin and ace-k, whereas the remaining
neurons responded only to ace-k and kcl. one rationalization
of these experiments is that increasing kcl will depolarize the
neuron and activate voltage-dependent ca2⫹ channels (vdcc)
that are widely expressed in all sensory neurons (20). vdcc
typically respond to 50 mm kcl stimulation, which evokes
extracellular ca2⫹ influx.
do as diffuse across the plasma membrane to activate
trpv1 receptors? having established that as activate trpv1
receptors, we inquired whether, like capsaicin, the as bind to
an intracellular binding site (17, 18). this is of interest because
at ph 7.4, the as are far from their pkas and are predominantly in their anionic form (fig. 1). therefore, in the
absence of any specific transport pathway, as would
be expected to be relatively (to the uncharged form) membrane
impermeable because of the large energy barrier involved in
transferring a charge from water into the low dielectric environment of a membrane (2).
recently, hill and schaeffer (11) found that trinitrophenol,
an anion that does not penetrate hek 293 cell membranes,
activates trpa1 receptors but not trpv1 receptors. however,
in a series of papers, desimone (8) and naim and colleagues
(37, 38, 40) addressed this issue and have demonstrated that at
neutral ph, saccharin (presumably in its anionic form) diffuses
across liposomes and trcs, where it accumulates and may
affect intracellular pathways. the question of anion transport
across membranes remains puzzling (8). however, thomae et

artificial sweeteners stimulate trpv1

al. (50), who recently investigated the permeation of weak
acids across lipid bilayers, may have provided a rationale for
this conundrum. they found that small amphiphilic anions do
indeed permeate across bilayers but at a much slower rate than
the uncharged form of the acid. they wrote, “the anions,
therefore, controlled the total permeation already at 1–2 ph
units above their pka. these results indicate that in contrast to
the expectations of the ph-partition hypothesis, lipid bilayer
permeation of an acidic compound can be completely controlled by the anion at physiological ph.” in this regard, we
note that the pkas of the as would be increased by their
partitioning into the low dielectric interfacial region of the
bilayer (32, 44). because these results suggest that anions can
diffuse into the cytoplasm, they are consistent with an intracellular binding site for the as. whether it is the same as that
of capsaicin will require further experimentation. how the
membrane-impermeable sucrose molecules activate trpv1 is
not at all clear, but one possibility is that at 37°c, where the
energy difference between open and closed states is small,
the change in osmotic pressure (26) will be sufficient to open
the channels. in summary, although trpv1 channels can be
opened by a variety of mechanisms, our data are most consistent with one in which as activate it via intracellular binding
sites.
how the activation of trpv1 by as may account for their
“off- and aftertastes”. from psychophysical studies, it was
found that the sensory attributes of as change and shift from
pleasant sweet to an unpleasant bitter and/or metallic taste
sensation with increasing concentration. in addition, when as
are compared with sucrose, they exhibit a longer time for the
taste sensation to be extinguished, thus giving them a lingering
aftertaste. in the following, we discuss the possibilities of how
trpv1 receptors may influence these phenomena.
chemosensation in the mouth can originate from the activation or inhibition of the corresponding signaling pathways of
the trcs, their associated neurons, and also primary somatosensory neurons expressing trpv1 receptors in their nerve
terminals, which are distributed throughout the oral cavity.
initially, we consider how as may affect the taste system via
transduction pathways in trcs. the elegant work of naim and
colleagues (40, 57, 58) provides a rationale for the lingering
aftertaste of as that does not require the activation of trpv1
channels. they showed that as, like saccharin, can diffuse
across the plasma membrane of the trcs and accumulate, at
relatively high concentrations, in the cytoplasm where they
may interact with and subsequently delay signal-termination
components located downstream of the sweet or bitter responding gpcrs (depending on the concentration). this inhibition
in delay in signal termination would therefore extend the taste
response, thereby giving rise to the sweet and bitter aftertaste
associated with as. also, along these non-trpv1 receptor
mechanisms, we note that amphipathic molecules have been
shown to open a variety of initially closed ion channels and
thus may open channels in trcs (6, 33). finally, in xenopus
laevis melanophores, it has been shown that saccharin can
activate the melatonin receptor, which also is expressed in rat
circumvallate papille taste buds (57).
in regard to mechanisms by which as may activate trpv1
channels to produce taste sensations, let us now consider the
trpv1 splice variant (trpv1t) that was identified and characterized by lyall and colleagues (29 –31) in rodent trcs.
ajp-regul integr comp physiol • vol

these researchers have shown that trpv1t, like trpv1, is
activated by capsaicin, and temperature and is modulated by
ethanol. in addition, upon obtaining whole nerve chorda tympani recordings from rats and wild-type and trpv1⫺/⫺ mice,
they found that trpv1t activation is involved in the tonic salt
response obtained in the presence of inhibitors of enacs (e.g.,
benzamil, amiloride). in this regard, as activation of trpv1t
could influence the taste sensation in a manner that is dependent on what other taste receptors are present in trcs containing trpv1t. to this point, several studies have described
the off-tastes of as as being metallic. helgren et al. (10)
reported that about 25% of a european population characterized an off-taste to saccharin as metallic or bitter. schiffman et
al. (42) found a high variability in the intensity and quality of
acesulfame-k that seemed to arise from its bitter and metallic
side tastes. recently, lim and lawless (25) characterized
metallic taste as the taste of multivalent cations, such as iron,
calcium, magnesium, and zinc. this activation by multivalent
cations points to a possible role of trpv1t in metallic taste
since ahern et al. (1) showed that trpv1 receptors can be
activated by high concentrations of calcium and magnesium
that bind to sites on the extracellular surface. in this regard, we
have found that physiologically relevant concentrations of
cuso4, znso4, and feso4 will also activate trpv1 receptors
(fig. 6a) and suggest that the activation of trpv1t (or other
trp channels in trcs) by these compounds (as well as ca2⫹
and mg2⫹) could also contribute to metallic taste.
a third candidate as pathway that would influence taste
sensation in a receptor-mediated manner would be trpv1
channels on the terminals of neurons from the geniculate
ganglion. in this regard, using mrna and immunocytochemistry, katsura et al. (19) identified trpv1 channels on the
somas geniculate ganglion (gg) neurons. however, it is not
known whether these receptors are functional or even on the
nerve terminals surrounding trcs in fungiform papillae. if
this were the case, however, then the as would have to diffuse
across the tight junctions between trcs into the extracellular
space between trcs for them to contact the gg nerve terminals. interestingly, this may account for the long latency seen
with as.
our findings that as activate the somatosensory system
through capsaicin-sensitive dissociated primary sensory neurons (fig. 5) lead to an interesting conclusion: if they can
diffuse into the lingual epithelium and activate capsaicinsensitive trigeminal neurons, then this could contribute to their
taste sensation and, moreover, may rationalize the bitter and
metallic latencies associated with as. however, we are unaware of any sensory study describing that as have a pungent
component. nevertheless, a recent paper from lim and green
(24) explored at the perceptual level whether bitter and burning/irritating attributes are related. they found, under several
conditions, that the bitter taste sensation of quinine and the
burning/irritating sensation from capsaicin are extremely similar and even nondistinguishable. we suggest that as at high
concentrations activate t2rs and trpv1, which may confuse
the sensations. this would provide an explanation for the
unclear bitter/metallic aftertaste.
in summary, we found two novel stimulants of trpv1
receptors: as and metallic salts. we hypothesize that these
interactions may account for of the aversive off-tastes of these
compounds.
