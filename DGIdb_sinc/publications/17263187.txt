activation of type-2 chloride channels: a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of chronic constipation.  chronic constipation affects up to 27% of the population and negatively impacts health-related quality-of-life. prescription medications targeting chronic constipation currently include  xxxd2982xxx , lactulose and  xxxd3302xxx , a serotonin type 4 receptor partial agonist. the most recent addition is  xxxd2513xxx  ( xxxd2513xxx ), a type-2 chloride channel ( xxxg472xxx ) activator which is a member of a new class of compounds known as prostones.  xxxd2513xxx  is a bicyclic fatty acid that acts locally on  xxxg472xxx  channels located in the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. this stimulation of chloride secretion induces the passive movement of sodium and water into the intestinal lumen, yielding a net increase in isotonic fluid, which results in improved bowel function. in double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials,  xxxd2513xxx  increased the number of spontaneous bowel movements compared with placebo and was generally well tolerated. the predominant adverse effects were nausea and diarrhea.  xxxd2513xxx  represents a new therapeutic class of compounds for the treatment of chronic constipation and will be the focus of this review.
