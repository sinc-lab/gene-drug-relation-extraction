23, 2008; doi:10.1152/ajprenal.00528.2007.—organic anion transporter (oat) genes have been implicated in renal secretion of organic
anions, but the individual in vivo contributions of  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  (first identified as nkt) and  xxxg2115xxx  remain unclear. potential substrates include
loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics (e.g.,  xxxd299xxx ), which reach their tubular sites of action mainly by
proximal tubular secretion. previous experiments in  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  knockout
(⫺/⫺) mice revealed an almost complete loss of renal secretion of the
prototypic organic anion p-aminohippurate (pah) and a role of  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx 
in tubular secretion of furosemide (eraly sa, vallon v, vaughn d,
gangoiti ja, richter k, nagle m, monte jc, rieg t, truong dm,
long jm, barshop ba, kaler g, nigam sk. j biol chem 281:
5072–5083, 2006). in this study we found that both furosemide and
 xxxd299xxx  inhibited moat1- and moat3-mediated uptake of
a labeled tracer in xenopus oocytes injected with crna, consistent
with their being substrates for mouse  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx . experiments
in  xxxg2115xxx ⫺/⫺ mice revealed intact renal secretion of pah, but the
dose-natriuresis curves for furosemide and  xxxd299xxx  were
shifted to the right and urinary furosemide excretion was impaired
similar to the defect in  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx ⫺/⫺ mice. thus, whereas  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  (in contrast
to  xxxg2115xxx ) is the classic basolateral  xxxg2113xxx  of the proximal
tubule, both  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  contribute similarly to normal renal
secretion of furosemide and  xxxd299xxx , and a lack of either one
is not fully compensated by the other. although microarray expression
analysis in the kidneys of  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx ⫺/⫺ and  xxxg2115xxx ⫺/⫺ mice revealed somewhat
altered expression of a small number of transport-related genes, none
were common to both knockout models. when searching for polymorphisms involved in human diuretic responsiveness, it may be necessary to
consider both  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx , among other genes.
organic anion transport; proximal tubule; tubular secretion
the kidneys efficiently eliminate a large variety of organic
anions (oa), including drugs of significant clinical relevance
such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), ␤-lactam antibiotics, and diuretics. two processes contribute to
renal elimination of oa, namely, glomerular filtration and
proximal tubular secretion. the knowledge of the mechanisms
involved in proximal tubular oa secretion has greatly increased in recent years due to cloning of potential oa transporters (oat) and establishment of their localization in the
kidney, as well as to in vitro studies in expression systems (for

review, see refs. 6, 9, 10, 19, 27, 29, 31, 42). little is still
known, however, about the functional contribution of the
individual transporter for a given substrate in the intact organism.
the basolateral uptake of oa into proximal tubules is
believed to operate by coupling the entry of oa to the exit of
dicarboxylates along their concentration gradient. dicarboxylates like ␣-ketoglutarate are maintained at high intracellular
concentrations through intracellular synthesis and na⫹-dicarboxylate cotransport, the latter being driven by the na⫹ gradient established by the na⫹-k⫹-atpase. the classic basolateral oat system, long referred to as the p-aminohippurate
(pah) transporter, was originally identified as novel kidney
transporter (nkt) (24), which was proposed to function in
renal organic ion secretion and was later directly shown to
function in this capacity and named  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  (7, 34). the other
primary candidate for basolateral oa uptake is  xxxg2115xxx , originally identified as roct [reduced in osteosclerosis (oc) transporter] (4), and several immunohistochemical studies have
localized both  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  to the basolateral membrane
of the proximal tubule of human, rat, and mouse (1, 8, 15, 16,
20, 23, 26, 35). when expressed in xenopus oocytes or epithelial cell lines,  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  couples oa entry to dicarboxylate exit
and was trans-stimulated by preloading with pah (34). similarly,  xxxg2115xxx  operates as an organic anion/␣-ketoglutarate
exchanger (2), and  xxxg2115xxx -mediated uptake of pah was transstimulated by glutarate (32). thus both transporters are candidates for basolateral uptake of oa in the proximal tubule.
the loop diuretic furosemide and the thiazide diuretic  xxxd299xxx  are both oa that have very high plasma
protein binding and thus gain access to their tubular sites of
action mainly by proximal tubular secretion. previous expression studies in xenopus oocytes with rat  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  (36) or in
mouse s2 cell lines with human  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  and human  xxxg2115xxx  (13)
had indicated that, in vitro, both  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  can transport thiazides as well as loop diuretics, but the in vivo relevance of these transport mechanisms remained unclear. because of the tremendous clinical importance of diuretic handling by the kidney, it is important to examine transport in vivo.
whereas for pah a number of transporters have been suggested
by in vitro studies [including  xxxg2115xxx  (8, 32, 33)], our previous
experiments in mice lacking  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  ( xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx ⫺/⫺) revealed an
almost complete loss of renal secretion of pah, indicating that
 xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  is the key transporter in vivo (11). the importance of
in vivo studies is further confirmed in the present experiments

renal transport of diuretics

showing that renal pah secretion is intact in mice lacking
 xxxg2115xxx . in this study we have further examined the interactions
of furosemide and  xxxd299xxx  with moat1 and moat3
in vitro and assessed the in vivo relevance. unlike pah, which
is almost exclusively transported through  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx , loop diuretics
and thiazide diuretics are each bound by the  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx 
transporters when expressed in xenopus oocytes, and there are
defects in the action of both diuretics in  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx 
knockout mice. the results suggest how the two oat transporters work in parallel during the elimination of common organic
anionic drugs and have clinical implications.
materials and methods

xenopus oocyte uptake assay. xenopus oocyte assays were performed as described previously (11, 18). capped rna was synthesized from linearized plasmid dna (moat1 image clone id 4163278;
moat3 image clone id 4239544) using mmessage mmachine in vitro
transcription kit (ambion, austin, tx) and was injected (1 ␮g/␮l, 23
nl/oocyte) into the oocytes using the nanoliter 2000 nanoinjector
(world precision instruments, sarasota, fl). two days after injection,
groups of 16 –20 oocytes were placed in a 24-well plate with 1 ml of
barth’s buffer containing a fluorescent anion tracer transported by
moat1 or moat3 [30 ␮m 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-cf) for moat1injected oocytes and 50 ␮m 5-carboxyfluorescein (5-cf) for moat3injected oocytes (kaler g, troung d, and nigam s, unpublished
observations)] and increasing concentrations of furosemide or  xxxd299xxx , the known  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  substrate pah, or the  xxxg2115xxx  substrate  xxxd2046xxx  (es), with no inhibitor in the control group.
after a 1-h incubation at 25°c, the oocytes were washed five times
with ice-cold barth’s buffer, and each group was then divided into

four samples of four to five oocytes. the oocytes were lysed before
measurements, the lysate was centrifuged, and the fluorescence of the
supernatant was measured using a fluorometer (polarstar plate reader;
bmg labtechnologies, durham, nc). considering the amount of the
diuretic in the incubation fluid and the volume used to lyse the
oocytes, the maximum concentration of the diuretic in the fluorescence assay was 20 ␮m. adding this concentration of furosemide or
 xxxd299xxx  to serial concentrations of 6-cf or 5-cf, respectively, did not reveal any quenching of the fluorescence signal of the
tracers. the oat-mediated clearance (difference in clearance between
crna-injected and noninjected oocytes) of the fluorescent tracer in
the presence of an inhibitor was calculated as the mean ⫾ se of
quadruplicate or triplicate samples. the median inhibition concentrations (ic50) were calculated using prism 4.0 software (graphpad, san
diego, ca). all tested compounds were purchased from sigmaaldrich (st. louis, mo).
generation of  xxxg2115xxx  knockout mice.  xxxg2115xxx ⫺/⫺ mice (33) were
backcrossed to c57bl/6j mice for eight generations. heterozygous
mice from the final backcross were bred to each other to generate
knockout and wild-type (wt) mice, from which all the animals used
in the experiments described were descended. only male mice were
used in the present experiments. mice were genotyped by pcr. all
experimental protocols were in accordance with the guide for the
care and use of laboratory animals (national institutes of health,
bethesda, md) and were approved by the institutional animal care
and use committee.

acute natriuretic responses to furosemide or  xxxd299xxx 
were assessed in anesthetized  xxxg2115xxx ⫺/⫺ mice as previously described
for furosemide in  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx ⫺/⫺ mice (11). briefly, ⬃30 min after clearance
experiments were finished and the infusion of pah was discontinued
(see above), slow bolus application of vehicle (0.85% nacl for
furosemide and 2.25 g/dl bsa and 1% dmso in 0.85% nacl for
 xxxd299xxx , 30 ␮l/25 g body wt over 1 min) was followed by
application of increasing doses of furosemide (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10
mg/kg) or  xxxd299xxx  (0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 1
mg/kg). after each bolus, allowing 2 min for drug distribution, urine
was collected via a bladder catheter for 5–10 min depending on
urinary flow rate to determine na⫹ excretion. as previously described
in detail (11), furosemide concentrations in urine were determined by
modification of the pah assay, which can detect sulfonamide therapeutic agents (28). sufficient urine for colorimetric detection of
furosemide in both genotypes was obtained after doses of 0.3 or 1
mg/kg and higher. at these time points, plasma pah (and therefore
likely urinary pah, as well, was estimated to be ⬍10⫺5 of initial
levels). consistent with primary detection of furosemide in the urine,
absorbance readings showed a nearly linear increase in urinary excretion with diuretic dose in both genotypes (see fig. 2a). in comparison,
the assay was not applicable to measure  xxxd299xxx . in
additional experiments, the natriuretic effect of  xxxd299xxx 
was tested in  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, the generation of which had previously
been described (11). wt and knockout mice used in these experiments were selected to have similar basal blood pressure to avoid the
confounding effect of any blood pressure changes on diuretic responsiveness.

results and discussion

the individual contributions of  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  in loop
and thiazide diuretic handling in vivo remain unclear. therefore, we performed a systematic analysis at the level of both
the transporter and the whole animal. all experiments were
performed in male animals.
inhibition of tracer uptake in moat1- and moat3-injected
oocytes by furosemide and  xxxd299xxx . we tested the
interaction of mouse  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  and mouse  xxxg2115xxx  with furosemide
and  xxxd299xxx , together with pah and es (controls for inhibition of moat1 and moat3, respectively). tracer
uptake in oocytes expressing moat1 was inhibited by pah
with an ic50 value of 8 ⫾ 2 ␮m (fig. 1a). this is consistent
with previous studies showing that coincubation of moat1transfected oocytes with unlabeled pah resulted in dosedependent inhibition of uptake of labeled pah with an estimated ki of 13 ␮m (11), which is similar to previously
reported values for the affinity of pah for moat1 (22). in
comparison, es inhibited tracer uptake with an ic50 value for
moat3 of 8 ⫾ 2 ␮m (fig. 1b). this is consistent with previous
studies reporting affinities of es for mouse, rat, and human
 xxxg2115xxx  of ⬃3 ␮m (8, 21, 33). furosemide and  xxxd299xxx  inhibited tracer uptake with ic50 values for moat1 of
8 ⫾ 1 and 8 ⫾ 3 ␮m, respectively (fig. 1a), which were
comparable with previously reported ki values for rat and
human  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  (13, 36). the ic50 values for furosemide and
 xxxd299xxx  in moat3 were 2.8 ⫾ 0.1 and 21 ⫾ 3 ␮m,
respectively (fig. 1b), also comparable with values previously
ajp-renal physiol • vol

obtained for human  xxxg2115xxx  in one prior study (13). thus both
furosemide and  xxxd299xxx  inhibited tracer uptake by
moat1 and moat3 in a concentration-dependent manner, consistent with their being substrates for these transporters.
quantitative pcr and microarray analyses of transporter
gene expression. as expected, there was no significant expression of  xxxg2115xxx  and  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  in the corresponding knockout mice, as
determined by quantitative pcr (fig. 2a). possibly as a consequence of the  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  genes being localized adjacent
to each other and the application of gene-targeting strategies to
delete one of the genes, the expression of  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  was reduced to
⬃40% in  xxxg2115xxx ⫺/⫺ mice and the expression of  xxxg2115xxx  to ⬃40%
in  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx ⫺/⫺ mice compared with wt mice. a previous study in
 xxxg2115xxx ⫺/⫺ mice had reported a similar reduction of renal mrna
expression for  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  (39). in comparison, the expression of
another proximal tubular oat, renal-specific transporter (rst
or urat1) (25), was affected in neither  xxxg2115xxx ⫺/⫺ nor  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx ⫺/⫺
mice compared with wt mice (fig. 2a). however, it should be
noted that the renal transport of the  xxxg2115xxx  substrate es is
unaffected in  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx ⫺/⫺ mice (11), and renal transport of the
 xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  substrate pah is unaffected in  xxxg2115xxx ⫺/⫺ mice (fig. 3).
thus the fact that  xxxg2115xxx  expression is decreased approximately
by one-half in  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, and vice versa, does not appear
to significantly impact function at the level of the intact
organism.
since there could conceivably be alternative transporters
compensating for the loss of  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  or  xxxg2115xxx , we also determined
the expression of other transporters implicated in renal organic
anion transport, the oa-transporting polypeptides (oatps;
slco family genes) (12) and the multidrug resistance (mdr)/
atp-binding cassette (abc) transporters (abcc family genes)
(30), as well as expression of the oat-related transporters, the
organic cation transporters (octs) and organic cation/carnitine
transporters (octns) (10). no significant changes ⬎50% in
expression of any of these genes were noted in either  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx ⫺/⫺
or  xxxg2115xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, with the exception of the expression of
slco4c1 in  xxxg2115xxx ⫺/⫺ (fig. 2b). we did multiple quantitative
pcr experiments trying to validate the latter finding, but these

experiments did not suggest a true expressional change for
slco4c1 in  xxxg2115xxx ⫺/⫺ mice. instead, the analysis indicated great
individual variation of the expression of slco4c1; the magnitude of this variation was much greater than the differences
observed between the wt and  xxxg2115xxx ⫺/⫺ kidneys (not shown).
the present results confirm a previous study that showed
unaltered expression of  xxxg2114xxx  and oat5 in male  xxxg2115xxx ⫺/⫺ mice
by quantitative pcr (39). that study further detected a lower
mrna expression of  xxxg2163xxx  (slco1a1) and  xxxg15xxx  ( xxxg15xxx ) in

renal transport of diuretics

(8, 21). the present renal clearance experiments significantly
refined the results from a previous study, which showed an
unaltered whole body clearance of both inulin and pah in
 xxxg2115xxx ⫺/⫺ mice using low-dose pah and maximum plasma
concentrations of ⬃20 nm, i.e., significantly lower than the
above-mentioned pah affinities (39). together with previous
studies showing that renal pah secretion is almost completely
absent in  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx ⫺/⫺ mice (11) (shown in fig. 3), the present data
are consistent with  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  being the classic basolateral pah
transporter in the kidney. assuming that protein expression is
affected similarly to mrna expression (unfortunately, no
commercially available antibody is available that recognizes
mouse  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx ), a reduced  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  mrna expression in  xxxg2115xxx ⫺/⫺
mice (see above) suggested that normal renal pah secretion is
maintained despite a significant reduction of  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  expression.
in accordance, previous studies provided evidence that significantly lower renal  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  mrna levels in female versus male
wt mice are sufficient to maintain similar pah elimination (5,
39). in contrast to pah, recent studies in  xxxg2115xxx ⫺/⫺ mice
indicated an important role of this transporter in the clearance
of both  xxxd2871xxx  and methotrexate (39, 40).
impaired natriuretic responses to furosemide and  xxxd299xxx  in  xxxg2115xxx ⫺/⫺ mice. the dose-natriuresis curves for
both furosemide (fig. 4a) and  xxxd299xxx  (fig. 4b)
were shifted to the right in  xxxg2115xxx ⫺/⫺ mice in the absence of
significant differences in maximum responses. figure 4d summarizes the half-maximal effective dose values of these experiments. moreover, impaired urinary excretion of furosemide
was directly demonstrated in these mice (fig. 4a). furthermore, furosemide doses of 1 mg/kg in wt and 3 mg/kg in
 xxxg2115xxx ⫺/⫺ mice resulted in similar levels of renal excretion of
the diuretic as well as of natriuresis, indicating that the pharmacodynamic response, once furosemide reached the tubular
lumen, was preserved in the absence of  xxxg2115xxx . these findings
demonstrate that an impaired pharmacokinetic response, i.e.,
impaired renal secretion, caused the observed rightward shift in
the natriuretic response to furosemide, and likely to  xxxd299xxx , in  xxxg2115xxx ⫺/⫺ mice.
impaired natriuretic response to  xxxd299xxx  in
 xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx ⫺/⫺ mice. the aforementioned results in  xxxg2115xxx ⫺/⫺ mice
with regard to the response to furosemide were nearly identical
to the response we previously observed in  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, i.e.,
a rightward shift in the natriuresis dose-response curve and
impaired renal excretion of furosemide (11). in this study we
have further shown that, as with  xxxg2115xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, intravenous
application of  xxxd299xxx  in  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx ⫺/⫺ mice resulted in
a natriuresis dose-response curve that was shifted rightward
compared with wt mice, whereas the maximum natriuretic
effect was not affected (fig. 4c). thus  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx ⫺/⫺ and  xxxg2115xxx ⫺/⫺
mice present a very similar rightward shift in the dose-natriuresis curves for both  xxxd299xxx  and furosemide
(11). previous studies showed that mice lacking the multidrug
resistance-associated protein 4 ( xxxg17xxx ), which localizes to the
apical membrane of the proximal tubule, have a reduced renal
clearance of furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide, but other
transporters maintain a significant efflux into the proximal
tubule lumen in these mice without fully compensating for the
absence of  xxxg17xxx  (14). our studies indicate that both  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx 
and  xxxg2115xxx  contribute to basolateral uptake, and thus renal
secretion, of furosemide and thiazide diuretics in vivo and that
lack of either one is not fully compensated by the other. thus,
ajp-renal physiol • vol

whereas some organic anions primarily use one specific transport molecule to cross a given cell membrane in vivo, such as
pah via  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx , others, such as loop and thiazide diuretics, use
multiple pathways. as a consequence, when searching for
polymorphisms involved in human diuretic responsiveness, it
may be necessary to consider both  xxxg1257xxx   xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  (3, 43),
among other genes (41).
