azathioprine induced profound myelosuppression linked
to  xxxg2319xxx  deficiency has now been documented in many
patient groups, including those with crohn’s disease. at
the start of azathioprine or  xxxd2573xxx  therapy,
measurement of  xxxg2319xxx  activity has a role in identifying
the 1 in 300 patients who are at risk of severe
myelosuppression when treated with standard  xxxd2573xxx 
dosages. during the initial months of azathioprine
therapy a knowledge of  xxxg2319xxx  status warns of early
bone marrow toxicity. in patients established on
azathioprine these is no clear evidence to suggest that
 xxxg2319xxx  is predictive of clinical response or drug toxicity,
indicating a role for  xxxg2319xxx  in the prediction of early
events rather than long term control. in patients with
crohn’s disease on long term azathioprine therapy, it is
clear that myelosuppression, particularly leucopenia, is
caused by other factors in addition to variable  xxxg2319xxx 
activity and therefore monitoring of blood cell counts
throughout treatment is essential.
..........................................................................

the importance of  xxxg2319xxx 
the first indication that  xxxg2319xxx  ( xxxg2319xxx ) deficiency was associated with
profound myelosuppression came from observations in adults taking azathioprine as an immunosuppressive agent. accumulation of grossly
elevated concentrations of  xxxd2573xxx  derived  xxxd3352xxx  nucleotide (tgn) cytotoxic
metabolites1 2 was linked to a lack of red blood cell
 xxxg2319xxx  activity.3 these observations of azathioprine induced profound myelosuppression linked
to  xxxg2319xxx  deficiency have now been documented
in many patient groups and confirmed by numerous reports.4–7

azathioprine has no indigenous immunosuppressive activity; it is a prodrug. the first step in
biotransformation is non-enzymic cleavage to
form  xxxd2573xxx  which in turn undergoes
extensive metabolism.8  xxxd2573xxx  can be
oxidised, methylated, or formed into a variety of
active thionucleotide metabolites. it is drug
derived  xxxd3352xxx  nucleotide which is eventually incorporated into dna as a false base.9
the thionucleotide metabolites of  xxxd2573xxx  compete with their endogenous counterparts
in many biochemical pathways. nucleotides play
a variety of important roles in all cells: they are

precursors of dna and rna, they are essential
carriers of energy (for example, atp and gtp),
and they also function as cellular second
messengers.10 it is the importance of these nucleotide dependent processes to functioning and
dividing cells that has endowed the  xxxd2573xxx 
antimetabolite azathioprine with both immunosuppressive and cytotoxic properties.

the role of  xxxg2319xxx  in the clinical
pharmacology of  xxxd2573xxx 
drugs
 xxxg2319xxx  methylates azathioprine metabolites at the
expense of tgn formation. both  xxxd2573xxx 
and  xxxd2573xxx  nucleotide (thioinosine
monophosphate) are good substrates for  xxxg2319xxx ,
but tgns are poor substrates.11 in the  xxxd2573xxx  treatment of childhood leukaemia,
 xxxg2319xxx  activities show a significant negative correlation to red blood cell tgn concentrations12 and
 xxxg2319xxx  deficiency is associated with grossly elevated tgn concentrations and profound
myelosuppression.13 multivariate analysis has
confirmed that higher tgn concentrations3 and
lower  xxxg2319xxx  activity14 tend to be associated with
better outcomes. therefore, in children with
lymphoblastic leukaemia,  xxxg2319xxx  activity has been
shown to reflect  xxxd2573xxx  efficacy and
toxicity.12–15
“in children with lymphoblastic leukaemia,
 xxxg2319xxx  activity has been shown to reflect
 xxxd2573xxx  efficacy and toxicity”
during chemotherapy, one reason for  xxxd2573xxx  “resistance” is very high  xxxg2319xxx  activities; extensive methylation results in suboptimal
cytotoxic tgn formation.12 a second cause of low
tgn concentrations is simply not taking the tablets. the two cases of low tgns can be distinguished by measurement of methylmercaptopurine nucleotide metabolites (products of the
 xxxg2319xxx  reaction) alongside tgns.16 reports based
on therapeutic drug monitoring suggest that 10%
of patients fail to take their  xxxd2573xxx  or
azathioprine tablets.16 17
 xxxd2573xxx  drugs are potential inducers of liver
damage and this is reflected in the abnormal liver
function tests which are frequently reported in

children undergoing  xxxd2573xxx  or  xxxd3352xxx  long
term maintenance chemotherapy for lymphoblastic
leukaemia.18 the exact mechanisms of induced hepatotoxicity
are unknown but  xxxg2319xxx  produced methylated  xxxd2573xxx 
metabolites have been implicated in the resultant liver
damage19; children with higher  xxxg2319xxx  activities develop more
hepatotoxicity.15

 xxxg2319xxx : the basics
 xxxg2319xxx  activity in the red blood cell and other human tissues is
under the control of a common genetic polymorphism.20 the
frequency distribution of  xxxg2319xxx  activity in caucasian populations is trimodal: approximately 89% of the population have
high enzyme activity and are homozygous for the wild-type
allele (tpmth), 11% inherit intermediate levels of enzyme
activity with one wild-type and one variant allele (heterozygous tpmth/tpmtl), while 1 in 300 subjects have no
functional activity (two variant alleles, homozygous tpmtl).
a number of variant  xxxg2319xxx  alleles have been described,21
and ethnic differences in the incidence of these variant alleles
may be important in the clinical use of thiopurines.  xxxg2319xxx *3a,
a double mutant, is the most frequently occurring variant
allele (tpmtl) in white caucasians but each mutation can
occur independently ( xxxg2319xxx *3b and  xxxg2319xxx *3c). in africanamericans the mutant allele frequency was the same as
recorded in caucasians, but  xxxg2319xxx *3c was the most prevalent
mutant allele.22 in a korean population  xxxg2319xxx *3c was the most
frequent variant allele, and the  xxxg2319xxx *3a allele was absent.21
“a number of variant  xxxg2319xxx  alleles have been
described, and ethnic differences in the incidence of
these variant alleles may be important in the clinical use
of thiopurines”

variant alleles were only detected in 2.0% of south west
asians ( xxxg2319xxx *3c) and 4.7% of chinese ( xxxg2319xxx *3c) compared
with 10% of caucasians ( xxxg2319xxx *2, *3a, and *3c), indicating
that  xxxg2319xxx *3c is the oldest mutation and  xxxg2319xxx *2 the most
recent, while variant alleles  xxxg2319xxx *4 to tpmt8 are thought to
be isolated mutations.23

 xxxg2319xxx  and crohn’s disease
the  xxxd2573xxx  drugs azathioprine and  xxxd2573xxx  are
well established in the treatment of crohn’s disease.24
non-allergic clinical toxicities appear to be dose dependent
and may correlate with aspects of azathioprine metabolism.24
leucopenia is a frequently reported side effect in patients with
inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), and the observations made
with respect to the  xxxg2319xxx  genetic polymorphism and bone
marrow toxicity in childhood leukaemia were initially
translated to the treatment of crohn’s disease in 1996 by cuffari and colleagues.25 this study investigated  xxxd2573xxx 
efficacy and toxicity in 25 adolescent patients with crohn’s
disease.  xxxg2319xxx  activity was investigated indirectly by measurement of the products of the  xxxg2319xxx  reaction the methylmercaptopurine nucleotide metabolites (memps). remission (assessed by a modified harvey bradshaw index (hbi))
correlated with tgn concentrations (p<0.5) but not memps.
 xxxd2573xxx  complications however were “generally associated” with increased memps. however, cuffari observed that
although a lack of clinical response (high hbi) was associated
with low tgns, a satisfactory clinical response (low hbi) was
associated with a wide range of red blood cell tgns. in a larger
patient group (n=82), disease remission was shown to correlate with tgns over 250 pmol/8×108 red blood cells.26 27
however, memps, potentially an indirect measure of  xxxg2319xxx 
activity, did not correlate with tgn concentrations.27 the
question now was, can direct measurement of  xxxg2319xxx

phenotypic activity or genotype assist clinicians in optimising
the therapeutic response to  xxxd2573xxx ?
“can direct measurement of  xxxg2319xxx  phenotypic activity
or genotype assist clinicians in optimising the
therapeutic response to  xxxd2573xxx ?”
a dramatic amplification of interest in the  xxxg2319xxx  genetic
polymorphism arose with the commercial availability of the
 xxxd2573xxx  enzyme and metabolite assays.28 29 this, coupled
with a number of institutions capable of “in house” pharmacogenetic analysis, has produced a plethora of abstracts in
recent years, but many of these have yet to be translated into
peer reviewed articles. dubinsky and colleagues28 in a study of
92 paediatric ibd patients, 79 of whom had crohn’s disease,
reported that patients heterozygous for  xxxg2319xxx  (8/92) had
higher tgn concentrations (p<0.001) and all responded to
therapy. this study confirmed an association between high red
blood cell tgns and clinical response to  xxxd2573xxx . the
best probability of patient response was not significantly
increased until red blood cell tgn concentrations were >235
pmol. the odds ratio of a therapeutic response for red blood
cell tgns greater than 235 pmol was 5.0 (95% confidence
interval 2.6–9.7; p<001). the products of the  xxxg2319xxx  reaction
(the memps) did not correlate with disease activity but
patients generating high memp concentrations did however
experience more hepatotoxicity. although hepatotoxicity was
experienced at low memp concentrations, the risk increased
threefold at memps above the third quartile (>5700 pmol).
in this study,28 analysis of  xxxg2319xxx  genotypes showed that
only one of 13 patients who experienced leucopenia was
heterozygous for  xxxg2319xxx . the vast majority (97%) of patients
with drug related toxicity had a wild-type  xxxg2319xxx  genotype. in
addition, the range of  xxxd2573xxx  dosages were similar in
the heterozygotes and wild-type  xxxg2319xxx  genotypes.28 subsequently, this group analysed  xxxg2319xxx  activities in 51 ibd
patients, of whom 35 had crohn’s disease.29 again, there was
no significant relationship between  xxxg2319xxx  activity and  xxxd2573xxx  dosage. in a subgroup of 42 patients, seven had intermediate  xxxg2319xxx  activity (that is, presumed heterozygotes) and all
were non-responders. in the group as a whole, red blood cell
tgns were positively correlated with therapeutic efficacy and
memps with drug related toxicity which, in the majority of
cases, was hepatotoxicity.
colombel and colleagues30 reported  xxxg2319xxx  genotype analysis
in 41 crohn’s disease patients. all of this patient group had
experienced leucopenia (white cell count <3.0×109/l) or
thrombocytopenia (platelets <100×109/l) leading to a reduction in  xxxd2573xxx  dose (17% of patients) or withdrawal (83%
of patients). four patients (10%) were  xxxg2319xxx  deficient (homozygous variant allele), seven (17%) were heterozygotes, and
the reminder had wild-type activity. from the start of  xxxd2573xxx  therapy, the time to bone marrow toxicity was less than
1.5 months in the four  xxxg2319xxx  deficient patients, ranged from
1 to 18 months in the heterozygotes, and from 0.5 to 87
months in patients with wild-type  xxxg2319xxx . variant alleles associated with lack of or lower  xxxg2319xxx  activity are over represented
in this small study group compared with the general population but it was clear that myelosuppression was caused by
other factors in these patients with crohn’s disease.30
by far the largest and perhaps the most extensive study on
 xxxg2319xxx  activities in ibd patients was reported by lowry and
colleagues.31 of 170 patients studied, 130 had crohn’s disease
and the duration of constant dose azathioprine (n=115) or
 xxxd2573xxx  (n=55) therapy ranged from 3.5 to 102
months. all patients had responded to, and were tolerant of,
thiopurines. patients with intermediate  xxxg2319xxx  activity (n=23,
13.5%) had significantly higher red blood cell tgn concentrations, but for the group as a whole there was no difference in
red blood cell tgns between those in clinical remission

 xxxg2319xxx  in the treatment of crohn’s disease with azathioprine

(n=114, 67%) and those with active disease. in lowry’s
report,31 active disease was recorded in 33% of those with
wild-type homozygous “normal”  xxxg2319xxx  activity and 33% of
patients with a heterozygous intermediate  xxxg2319xxx  activity. neither pretreatment or on-therapy  xxxg2319xxx  activities were associated with leucopenia but the self selected nature of this cohort
would have excluded those individuals with early leucopenia.
a recent report by campbell and colleagues32 of  xxxg2319xxx 
activities in 113 ibd patients (61 with crohn’s disease) investigated those who were currently taking azathioprine (n=63),
those who had discontinued azathioprine (n=24), and those
who had never taken azathioprine (n=26).  xxxg2319xxx  activities
were similar in all three groups (range 9–41 units; median 25).
 xxxg2319xxx  activity correlated (r=0.41, p<0.001) with the lowest
neutrophil count in the first four months of azathioprine
therapy. in the intolerant group, those experiencing neutropenia had significantly lower  xxxg2319xxx  activities than those experiencing other toxicities (for example, pancreatitis, hepatitis,
dermatological problems). survival analysis, based on time to
first relapse, was performed on a subgroup of patients taking
low dose (<2.0 mg/kg) azathioprine. those individuals with
lower  xxxg2319xxx  activities (<20 units) had a statistically
significant relapse free advantage (log rank chi2=4.0;
p<0.05).32 in this low dose azathioprine cohort, mean  xxxg2319xxx 
activities in patients with stable disease (n=20) were significantly lower (19.8 v 27.6 units) than those measured in
patients who had experienced active disease (n=14).
similar apparently contradictory results have emerged
when assessing the clinical value of  xxxg2319xxx  in the context of
azathioprine immunosuppression for other patient groups. in
the long term treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus
with azathioprine,  xxxg2319xxx  genotyping failed to predict the
majority of  xxxd2573xxx  induced neutropenias.33 in contrast, in
rheumatic disease,  xxxg2319xxx  genotype predicted therapy limiting
toxicity induced by azathioprine, five of the six patients with
variant alleles experienced leucopenia within one month of
starting thiopurines. within two months of starting azathioprine, seven patients had abnormal liver function tests. six of
the seven had wild-type  xxxg2319xxx  alleles.34 taken together, the
results of all of the studies detailed above indicate a potential
role for  xxxg2319xxx  in the prediction of early events rather than long
term control.

drug-drug interactions
the clinician should be aware that a number of compounds,
which could be coadministered with azathioprine or  xxxd2573xxx , may potentially influence  xxxg2319xxx  activity. after a
therapeutic dose of aspirin, plasma concentrations of salicylic
acid are within the range for  xxxg2319xxx  inhibition35 and the loop
diuretic  xxxd2167xxx  inhibits  xxxg2319xxx  at concentrations within the
therapeutic range for  xxxd2167xxx .36
“a number of compounds, which could be
coadministered with azathioprine or  xxxd2573xxx ,
may potentially influence  xxxg2319xxx  activity”
 xxxd282xxx ,  xxxd2781xxx ,  xxxd3255xxx , and 5-aminosalicylic
acid are potent inhibitors of  xxxg2319xxx  in vitro.37 38 in a large long
term clinical study of ibd,  xxxd2573xxx  was withdrawn in
10% of patients because of the occurrence of adverse reactions.
over half of the patients in that study were treated simultaneously with  xxxd2573xxx  and  xxxd3255xxx .39 a possible
drug-drug interaction, linked to  xxxg2319xxx  inhibition, was
reported in a patient with refractory crohn’s disease who
developed bone marrow suppression while receiving daily
 xxxd2573xxx  and  xxxd2781xxx .40
in the report of dubinsky and colleagues,28 48 patients
(52%) received concomitant  xxxd2579xxx  therapy but coadministration of  xxxd2579xxx  was reported not to influence

145

tgn or memp concentrations. this was later confirmed in a
subsequent study reporting  xxxg2319xxx  activities in 51 ibd patients
(35 with crohn’s disease).29 concurrent  xxxd2579xxx  did not
influence  xxxg2319xxx  activity or  xxxd2573xxx  derived metabolite
concentrations. this report is in contrast with the findings of
lowry and colleagues41 who compared red blood cell tgns in
the same patient prior to and during coadministration of 5′
aminosalicylic acids.  xxxd2579xxx ,  xxxd282xxx , and  xxxd3255xxx  all produced increased red blood cell tgns in the 29
crohn’s disease patients studied. this was taken to indicate
the possibility of in vivo  xxxg2319xxx  inhibition.41 inhibition of an
enzyme in vivo will not necessarily be reflected by lower  xxxg2319xxx 
activities because  xxxg2319xxx  is measured in vitro in the absence of
the inhibitor.
patients receiving concurrent  xxxd2579xxx ,  xxxd3255xxx ,
or  xxxd2781xxx  had significantly lower median white cell counts
compared with patients not taking aminosalicylates.31 in
addition to the possible myelosuppressive influence of
increased tgn concentrations, there are other factors that can
influence leucocyte count in these patients. an additional
variable in the occurrence of leucopenia is the ability of the
individual to metabolise aminosalicylates by acetylation. variations in the ability to form the major metabolite n-acetyl
5’aminosalicycylic acid (that is, “slow acetylator” status) have
been linked to leucopenia. this may also contribute to the
myelosuppression observed with  xxxd3255xxx .41 42

conclusions
when reflecting on  xxxg2319xxx  activity in the treatment of crohn’s
disease with azathioprine, it is clear that one is dealing with a
mixed cohort of patients receiving a wide variety of  xxxd2573xxx 
dosages supplemented to various degrees by other immunosuppressive agents.24 at the start of azathioprine or  xxxd2573xxx  therapy, measurement of  xxxg2319xxx  activity has a role in
identifying the 1 in 300 patients who are at risk of severe
myelosuppression when treated with standard  xxxd2573xxx 
dosages. in addition, identification of the heterozygote
intermediate  xxxg2319xxx  individual identifies those prone to early
leucopenic episodes. during the initial four months of  xxxd2573xxx  therapy, lower  xxxg2319xxx  activities correlate with low neutrophil counts.32 thus a knowledge of  xxxg2319xxx  status warns of early
bone marrow toxicity. indications are that identification of the
heterozygote would indicate those patients who could be
safely managed on lower (<2.0 mg/kg) azathioprine
dosages.32 we await a formal analysis of  xxxg2319xxx  activities with
respect to the frequency of active disease recurrence in those
patients on long term  xxxd2573xxx  immunosuppression.
“a knowledge of  xxxg2319xxx  status warns of early bone
marrow toxicity”
in patients established on azathioprine,  xxxg2319xxx  was not predictive of clinical response or drug toxicity.31 these observations are perhaps due in part to the self selected nature of this
group of patients in whom early events had already occurred.
thus during long term  xxxd2573xxx  therapy, it appears that by
careful titration of dosages to clinical response by frequent
monitoring of blood cell counts and liver function tests the
 xxxg2319xxx  genetic polymorphism could have been circumvented.
as yet, there is no evidence to suggest a specific role for  xxxg2319xxx 
in the management of patients already established on
azathioprine/ xxxd2573xxx  immunosuppression. however,
taken together the results of the studies detailed in this article
indicate a role for  xxxg2319xxx  in the prediction of early events rather
than long term control.
in the patient with crohn’s disease on long term
azathioprine therapy it is clear that myelosuppression,
particularly leucopenia, is caused by other factors in addition
to variable  xxxg2319xxx  activity and therefore monitoring of blood
cell counts throughout treatment remains essential.15
