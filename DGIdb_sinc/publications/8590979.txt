1 the aim of the present study was to characterize the presynaptic a2-autoreceptors in human right
atrium in terms of the a2ad system. segments of atrial appendages were preincubated with [3h]noradrenaline and then superfused in the presence of cocaine and stimulated electrically. pec30% values
of eight a-adrenoceptor antagonists with discriminatory power were determined. pec30% is the negative
logarithm of the antagonist concentration that increased the stimulation-induced overflow of tritium by
30%. for four antagonists, the dissociation constant kd was determined, in addition to pec30%, against
the overflow-inhibiting effect of 5-bromo-6-(2-imidazolin-2-ylamino)-quinoxaline (uk 14,304) under
autoinhibition-free conditions.
2 pec30% and kd values yielded identical rank orders of antagonist affinity (rauwolscine > wb
4101>  xxxd2914xxx  >  xxxd3000xxx ) suggesting that both released noradrenaline and the exogenous agonist
uk 14,304 activated the same receptor to inhibit release.
3 the eight antagonist pec3o% values obtained in right atrium correlated significantly with their
pec30% values, reported in the literature, at the presynaptic a2c-autoreceptors in human kidney
(r=0.817; slope of the regression line 1.03). no significant correlation was obtained between pec30%
values at atrial autoreceptors and pkd values at previously characterized a2a-autoreceptors in rabbit and
a2d-autoreceptors in rat, mouse and guinea-pig tissues.
4 comparison of antagonist pec30% values with their pkd values at native a2 binding sites in cells or
tissues that express a single subtype only, and with pkd values at a2 binding sites in membranes of cos
cells transfected with human a2 subtype genes confirms the a2c character of the atrial autoreceptors:
significant correlations were obtained exclusively with the a2c binding sites.
5 ratios of kd values were computed for a2-autoreceptors in human right atrium and for binding sites
in cos cells transfected with human a2 subtype genes. the autoreceptor ratios corresponded well with
the respective ratios for the a2c binding sites (maximal three fold deviation) but were, in part, markedly
different from ratios calculated for a2a and x2b binding sites (up to 166 fold deviation). this outcome
supports the m2c designation of the autoreceptors.
6 in conclusion, the presynaptic a2-autoreceptors in human right atrium are x2c. in this they agree with
the previously characterized a2-autoreceptors in human kidney. the a2c classification possibly separates,
in general, human a2-autoreceptors from those in lagomorph (rabbit) and rodent (rat, mouse, guinea pig)
species that have been proposed to be predominantly a2a or a2d.

introduction
a2-adrenoceptors are not a homogeneous class of receptors.
based on radioligand binding, four subtypes have been described: a2a, m2b, a2c, and x2d (simonneaux et al., 1991). little
is known about the functions the various subtypes subserve. so
far, the presynaptic cx2-autoreceptors, the prototype a2-adrenoceptors, have been most investigated. in rat brain cortex,
hypothalamus, vas deferens, submaxillary gland and kidney
the a2-autoreceptors are all a2d (connaughton & docherty,
1990; limberger et al., 1992; schwartz & malik, 1992; smith &
docherty, 1992; smith et al., 1992; bohmann et al., 1993; 1994;
trendelenburg et al., 1993; millan et al., 1994). an exception
to the subtype homogeneity within the rat has been observed
only for the atrial x2-autoreceptors. the pharmacology of these
autoreceptors deviates from that in other rat tissues and they
have been classified as either a2b or a2d-like (connaughton &
docherty, 1990; limberger et al., 1992; smith et al., 1992; see
also smith et al., 1995). in fact, the first evidence for heterogeneity of the a2-adrenoceptor class was obtained when pre-

synaptic a2-autoreceptors were compared in rat heart and vas
deferens (doxey & everitt, 1977). in rabbit brain cortex, pulmonary artery, kidney and atria the a2-autoreceptors have
been characterized as a2a (limberger et al., 1991; 1995a;
molderings & g6thert, 1992; trendelenburg et al., 1993).
based on these results, it has been proposed that 'the majority
of a2-autoreceptors generally are a2d in the rat and a2a in the
rabbit. moreover, receptors of the a2am group generally may
be the main mammalian a2-autoreceptors' (trendelenburg et
al., 1993).
molecular genetics indicate that this a2a/ concept may be
restricted even to a single adrenoceptor subtype: a2a- and a2dadrenoceptors are structurally very similar across species, the
amino acid identity being 89 to 96% in man, rat, mouse and
pig (see bylund et al., 1994; o'rourke et al., 1994). despite the
small structural differences, the receptor proteins have different
pharmacological properties: in man and pig the pharmacology
is a2a whereas in rat and mouse it is a2d. a2a and a2d may be
considered as 'orthologous' a2-adrenoceptors only one being
present in any given species. hence, across all mammalian
species, noradrenergic neurones probably predominantly express the same gene, the a2 /dortholog, to control transmitter

release through presynaptic autoreceptors (see limberger et
al., 1995a). in agreement with the a2am hypothesis, the a2autoreceptors in mouse and guinea-pig brain cortex as well as
in guinea-pig atria and ileum have recently been subclassified
as a2d (funk et al., 1994; trendelenburg et al., 1994b; limberger et al., 1995b). there is also some evidence that a2-autoreceptors in human brain cortex may belong to the a2a
subtype (raiteri et al., 1992). the hypothesis, however, has
been challenged when the a2-autoreceptors in human kidney
have been shown to conform to the a2c subtype (trendelenburg et al., 1994a).
isolated cardiac tissue has been used successfully to study
the release, and modulation of release, of noradrenaline from
postganglionic sympathetic nerve endings. guinea-pig atria
and rabbit heart were among the tissues in which presynaptic
release-inhibiting a2-autoreceptors (langer et al., 1971; starke,
1971; 1972; mcculloch et al., 1972) as well as presynaptic release-enhancing f-adrenoceptors (adler-graschinsky & langer, 1975) and  xxxg99xxx  receptors (schumann et al., 1970)
were first described. recently, we have shown that, in human
right atrium, the release of noradrenaline is similarly modulated through presynaptic a2 and p-adrenoceptors and  xxxg99xxx  receptors (rump et al., 1994; 1995). the present
study was devised to characterize the a2-adrenoceptors in terms
of the a2ad system. moreover, we were interested to see
whether the a2-autoreceptors in human cardiac tissue fit into
the a2a concept of presynaptic a2-autoreceptors.

methods
human atrial tissue
the present in vitro study on human right atrial appendages
was approved by the local ethics committee. tissues were taken from 26 patients undergoing open heart surgery for coronary bypass grafting (24 patients) and aortic valve
replacement (2 patients). the age of the patients averaged
60.8 ± 2.2 years (range: 35 to 78). none of the patients had
been treated with drugs known to interfere with either the
storage or release mechanism of noradrenaline.

experimental protocol
right atrial appendages were dissected free from connective
tissue and four to six segments per atrium were prepared. the
tissue segments, weighing on average 15.6±0.5 mg (n = 138),
were incubated with [3h]-noradrenaline (0.5 gm) for 60 min in
krebs-henseleit solution, which was continuously bubbled
with 5% co2 in 95% 02. after incubation, each of the segments was placed in one of six parallel chambers (250 ja volume) between platinum electrodes and then superfused at
37°c with tritium-free krebs-henseleit solution (flow rate
2.5 ml min-'). cocaine 10 gm was added to the solution from
105 min of superfusion onwards. after 141 min of superfusion, the superfusion solution was collected in 28 or 35
fractions. at the end of the experiment, the tissue segments
were dissolved; tritium content was determined in superfusate
samples and tissue.
the krebs-henseleit solution contained (mm): nacl 118,
kcl 4.7, cac12 2.5,  xxxd2534xxx  0.45, nahco3 25, kh2po4 1.0,
glucose 11.1,  xxxd228xxx  0.07, disodium edta 0.067, corticosterone 0.02.
during superfusion, five periods of electrical stimulation
were applied. an initial priming stimulation was delivered after
125 min of superfusion consisting of rectangular pulses at
10 hz for 60 s (45 ma current strength, 1 ms pulse width).
the following four periods of electrical stimulation (s1 to s4)
each consisted either of 300 pulses at 5 hz or ofs trains of 10
pulses at 100 hz, train interval 50 s (45 ma, 1 ms-pulses).
when the effects ofa-adrenoceptor antagonists on the stimulation-induced overflow of tritium were determined (si to
s4) each consisted of 300 pulses at 5 hz. antagonists were

prejunctional a2c-adrenoceptors in human atrium

added at increasing concentrations from 12 min before s2, s3
and s4 onwards in order to yield cumulative antagonist concentration-response curves (see figure la below). antagonist
pec3o% values (negative logarithms of concentrations that
enhanced the stimulation-induced overflow of tritium by 30%)
were interpolated from the averaged concentration-response
curves.
for some of the antagonists, the a2-autoreceptor/antagonist

dissociation constant, kd, was determined in addition to the
pec30% value. in these experiments, si to s4 each consisted of
5 trains of 10 pulses at 100 hz, train interval 50 s. antagonists
when used, were added to the superfusion solution at a constant concentration 23 min before si. the a2-selective agonist,
5-bromo-6-(2-imidazolin-2-ylamino)-quinoxaline (uk 14,304)
was added at increasing concentrations from 16 min before s2,
s3 and s4 onwards in order to yield cumulative concentrationinhibition curves (see figure lb below). a single concentration-inhibition curve for uk 14,304 in the absence of antagonists served for comparison with the effect of uk 14,304 in
the presence of an antagonist. the concentration of uk 14,304
causing 50% inhibition, in the absence and in the presence of
antagonist, was interpolated from the respective averaged
concentration-inhibition curve. the negative logarithm of the
dissociation constant (pkd) was then calculated according to
equation 4 of furchgott (1972).
the outflow of tritium from the tissue was calculated as a
fraction of the tritium content of the tissue at the start of the
respective collection period and is expressed as fractional rate
(min-'). the stimulation-induced overflow of tritium elicited
by electrical stimulation was calculated by subtraction of the
estimated basal outflow from the total tritium outflow during
the collection period in which the stimulation was applied plus
the three periods thereafter; the basal outflow of tritium was
assumed to decline linearly from the collection period before to
the fourth collection period after stimulation. the overflow of
tritium was then expressed as a percentage of the tritium
content of the tissue segment at the time of stimulation. for
further evaluation of the stimulation-induced overflow of tritium, ratios were calculated for the overflow induced by s2, s3
and s4 and the overflow induced by si (s2/s1, s3/si, s4/si).
moreover, effects of a-adrenoceptor antagonists and of uk
14,304 on the stimulation-induced overflow were calculated, in
each single tissue segment, as a percentage of the corresponding average control (no antagonist, no agonist) s2/s,
s3/s1 and s4/si ratios.

statistics
results are expressed as arithmetic mean + s.e.mean. groups

and brl 41992 (hc1 10 mm) before being added to the superfusion medium. none of the solvents had any effect on
either spontaneous efflux or stimulation-induced overflow of
tritium.

results
as shown in figure 1, electrical stimulation induced a reproducible increase in the outflow of tritium from segments of
the right atrium, preincubated with [3h]-noradrenaline. when
300 pulses were applied at 5 hz, the overflow of tritium induced by the first stimulation period si was 191±14 bq, corresponding to 0.554+0.039% of the tritium content of the
tissue (n = 69). the a-adrenoceptor antagonists, rauwolscine (1
to 100 nm), wb 4101 (10 nm to 1 pm),  xxxd2914xxx  (1 nm to
1 gm),  xxxd3000xxx , corynanthine, brl 41992, skf 104078 and
brl 44408 (each 1o nm to 1 gm) increased concentration-dependently the stimulation-induced overflow of tritium. this is
shown for rauwolscine in figure la. concentration-response
curves for rauwolscine, wb 4101,  xxxd2914xxx ,  xxxd3000xxx  and
corynanthine are illustrated in figure 2. from the averaged
concentration-response curves, pec30% values (negative logarithms of antagonist concentrations that increased the stimulation-induced overflow by 30%) were interpolated; they are
summarized in table 1.

nists were present from 23 min before si onwards and the a2selective agonist, uk 14,304, was added at increasing concentrations before s2, s3 and s4. figure lb illustrates an experiment with rauwolscine. si to s4 each consisted of 5 trains
of 10 pulses at 100 hz. in the absence of antagonists, the stimulation-induced overflow of tritium at si was 0.167±0.012%
of the tritium content of the tissue (n = 25). the antagonists did
not significantly change the overflow of si indicating that autoinhibition did not develop under these conditions of electrical stimulation (compare overflow peaks at si in figure lb
upper panel with those in the lower panel illustrating the lack
of effect of rauwolscine). uk 14,304 concentration-dependently reduced the stimulation-induced overflow of tritium. as
shown in figure 3, rauwolscine (10 nm), wb 4101 (300 nm),
 xxxd2914xxx  (300 nm) and  xxxd3000xxx  (100 nm) shifted the
concentration-inhibition curve for uk 14,304 to the right.
from these shifts dissociation constants kd were calculated;
their negative logarithms are summarized in table 1. for each
antagonist, the pkd value was higher than its pec30% value,
the difference being greatest for  xxxd2914xxx .

discussion
small segments of human right atrium appendages, when incubated with [3h]-noradrenaline, specifically accumulate and
store radioactivity (rump et al., 1994). electrical stimulation
evokes a reproducible overflow of tritium that is abolished by
tetrodotoxin as well as by removal of ca2". hence, the stimulation-induced overflow of tritium reflects action-potential
evoked release of [3h]-noradrenaline and may be taken as an
index of noradrenaline release from postganglionic sympathetic nerve endings.
recently, we have shown that in human right atrium the
release of noradrenaline is reduced by activation of presynaptic
a2-autoreceptors (rump et al., 1995). the aim of the current
study was to subclassify these autoreceptors in terms of the
a2a-d system. a functional receptor is best characterized by the
relative affinities of agonists and, preferably, antagonists
(kenakin et al., 1992; for some methodological comments on
autoreceptor classification see limberger et al., 1995a). in the
present study, eight a-adrenoceptor antagonists with discriminatory power were chosen. the release-enhancing potencies of these antagonists were assessed as affinity estimates;
the antagonists competed with released noradrenaline for the
autoreceptor. pec30% values (i.e. negative logarithms of the
antagonist concentrations that increased release of noradrenaline by 30%) were calculated to quantify antagonist affinities. for some of the antagonists, the potency against the
release-inhibiting effect of the a2-selective agonist, uk 14,304,
was assessed in addition, yielding the dissociation constant kd
of the antagonist/autoreceptor complex as a more direct
measure of affinity. kd values were determined in the absence
of presynaptic autoinhibition. this was achieved by stimulating the tissue with short (91 ms) trains of electric pulses, too
short to allow autoinhibition to develop (singer, 1988). autoinhibition-free conditions are required for valid determination of dissociation constants (fuder et al., 1983; limberger et
al., 1989; see starke et al., 1989).
when both pec30% and pkd were determined for an antagonist, the pkd value was higher than the pec30% value,

prejunctional a2c-adrenoceptors in human atrium
indicating that more than 50% receptor occupation by an
antagonist was necessary for a 30% increase in noradrenaline
release. in this respect the human right atrium differs from
human kidney in which, for a given antagonist, pec30% and
pkd values correspond well (trendelenburg et al., 1994a). the
human atrium also differs from rabbit and rat atria, rabbit
kidney and rat submaxillary gland. in these tissues pec30%
values are higher than the respective pkd value indicating that
less than 50% receptor occupation sufficed for a 30% increase
in noradrenaline release (limberger et al., 1992; 1995a). most
importantly, in human right atrium, as in the tissues mentioned, the rank order of the pec30% values is identical to the
rank order of the pkd values (rauwolscine > wb 4101>
 xxxd2914xxx > xxxd3000xxx ) suggesting that both released noradrenaline and the exogenous agonist, uk 14,304, inhibited
transmitter release through the same x2-receptor.
in a first attempt to classify the presynaptic x2-autoreceptors in human right atrium, the eight antagonist pec30%
values were compared with their pec30% values previously
reported for the a2c-autoreceptors in human kidney (trendelenburg et al., 1994a). as shown in figure 4, the pec30% values
in the two tissues are significantly correlated with the regression line passing almost exactly through the origin of the coordinate system and the slope of the line being almost unity.
the close correlation suggests that atrial and renal a2-autoreceptors belong to the same subtype, namely x2c. the a2c
designation gains further, though indirect, support by the nonidentity of the atrial autoreceptors with the a2a- and a2d-autoreceptors previously described in rabbit, rat, mouse and
guinea-pig tissues (see introduction for references). there is no
significant correlation between antagonist pec30% values in
human right atrium on the one hand and, on the other hand,
antagonist pkd values at either a2a-autoreceptors in rabbit
brain cortex, atria and kidney, or a2d-autoreceptors in rat,
mouse and guinea-pig brain cortex, rat kidney and submaxillary gland, and guinea-pig atria (5 to 8 antagonists entered into each regression analysis; the best correlation was
obtained with the a2a-autoreceptors in rabbit kidney; r = 0.848;
5 antagonists).
in order to determine the subtype of the a2-autoreceptors in
human right atrium more convincingly, the antagonist pec30%
values were also compared with their pkd values (i) at native

prototype a2 binding sites in cells or tissues that express a single
subtype only, and (ii) at a2 binding sites in membranes of cos
cells transfected with either the human a2-c1o (ax, the human
a2-c2 (x2b) or the human x2-c4 (a2c) gene. the binding site
pkd values were taken from the literature. linear regression
analyses were carried out to determine the degree of similarity
between a2-autoreceptors and a2 binding sites. as shown in
figures 5 and 6, the comparison confirms the initial a2c suggestion: the pec30% values at the atrial 0(2-autoreceptors are
significantly correlated exclusively with the pkd values at the
a2c binding sites expressed in ok cells and those expressed in
cos cells transfected with the human a2-c4 gene. however,
one might object that the mere fact of a significant correlation
does not prove the identity of the atrial autoreceptors with the
a2c binding sites. in case of identity, the slope of the regression
line should be equal to unity and the regression line should
start from the origin. figures 5c and 6c show that these two
prerequisites for absolute agreement were not fulfilled. the
reasons are not known. variations in experimental conditions
(isolated tissues versus cultured cells) and in parameters measured (competition of radioligand binding versus disinhibition
of release) may be an explanation. absolute antagonist affinity
estimates at binding sites are often higher than absolute affinity

prejunctional a2c-adrenoceptors in human atrium
estimates at functioning receptors. systematic differences in
absolute ligand affinity estimates at identical binding sites are
also observed in binding studies when carried out in different
laboratories. for instance, bylund et al. (1992) reported about
10 times higher ligand pkd values at a2c sites in membranes
obtained from cos-7 cells transfected with the human a2-c4
gene than did devedjian et al. (1994); moreover, there is only a
poor correlation between the affinity estimates at the a2c sites
of the two studies. systematic deviations of experimental data
seem to be quite common and similar results have been explained by the use of different assay buffers (bylund et al.,
1992). when looking at the regression analyses between
pec30%-values at atrial autoreceptors and pkd-values at the
various a2 binding sites presented in figures 5 and 6, it is
obvious that the correlation is best between autoreceptors and
a2c binding sites despite the deviation from absolute agreement. for k2c sites, the pairs of antagonist pec30%/pkd-values
are lined up along the regression line, whereas for a2a, m2b and
a2d sites the pairs of pec30%/pkd-values are much more
scattered about the coordinate system. the identification of the
atrial autoreceptors as a2c is supported by the significant correlation between the antagonist pec30%-values and their pkd
values at a2c binding sites in rat brain cortex (r = 0.838;

shown are ratios for human atrial presynaptic a2-autoreceptors (calculated from pkd values of table 1) and for a2 binding sites in
membranes of cos cells transfected with either the human cx2-c1o, a2-c2 or a2-c4 gene (from lomasney et al., 1991 and devedjian et
al., 1994; mean ratio if kd values were reported in both studies).

p < 0.05; 7 antagonists), whereas the correlation between
m2d sites in the same
tissue did not reach a level of significance (r=0.151; p>0.05; 7
antagonists; binding data from uhl6n et al., 1992).
the problem of variability of experimental data shows that
multiple comparisons are mandatory for a reliable subtype
identification. to validate further the classification, ratios of
antagonist dissociation constants kd were computed for hu-

pec30%-values and the pkd values at

man

with

right atrium and for binding sites in cos cells transfected

one of the three human a2 genes. the ratio of the kds of
two antagonists, a measure of the relative affinity of these two
antagonists at a given receptor, can be a sensitive indicator of
receptor subtypes (bylund et al., 1992). assuming that a more
than tenfold difference in the kd ratio of a pair of antagonists
indicates a true difference in their relative affinity, the analysis
favours the conclusion that the atrial autoreceptors belong to

l.c. rump et al

the a2c subtype: three of the four ratios calculated for the
atrial autoreceptors deviate more than ten fold from the respective ratios calculated for the a2a binding sites expressed in
cos cells that had been transfected with the x2-c1o gene
(maximal deviation 166 fold; see table 2). the same holds true
for the four ratios calculated for the a2b binding sites in cos
cells transfected with the a2-c2 gene (maximal deviation 24
fold). in contrast, the four autoreceptor ratios deviate maximally three fold from the respective ratios for the a2c binding
sites in cos cells transfected with the ae2-c4 gene. it should be
pointed out that, apart from pec30%, the kd is a second, independently obtained affinity estimate for the antagonists at
atrial oe2-autoreceptors. therefore, the outcome of the kd ratio
comparison strongly supports the a2c designation of the autoreceptors reached by the correlation analyses of the pec30%
values.
so far, in man presynaptic a2-autoreceptors have been
subclassified in brain cortex (raiteri et al., 1992), kidney
(trendelenburg et al., 1994a) and right atrium (present study).
in brain cortex, it has been suggested that they are a2a. this
contrasts with the a2c classification in the kidney and heart
atrium. one explanation may be that, in man, the x2-autoreceptors in the central nervous system differ from those in the
postganglionic sympathetic nervous system. this, however, is
unlikely because in other species a difference between central
and peripheral a2-autoreceptors has not been observed. within
the rabbit, for instance, there is an impressive a2a subtype
homogeneity of central and peripheral a2-autoreceptors, and
the same holds true for the rat and the guinea-pig with their
a2d homogeneity (see introduction). the brain cortex results
are open to an additional explanation. a major argument for
the a2a classification of the autoreceptors was the observation
that  xxxd3000xxx  and arc 239, antagonists with high affinity for

pron al a2c-adrenoceptor in human atrium

2623

the a2b and a2c subtypes as compared to a2a and a2d, were
ineffective at 300 nm against the release-inhibiting effect of
clonidine (raiteri et al., 1992). however, in absolute terms the
affinities of  xxxd3000xxx  and arc 239 seem to be lower at human
a2c-autoreceptors (pkd of  xxxd3000xxx ; 7.2 in right atrium and 6.2
in the kidney; pkd of arc 239: 6.3 in the kidney; table 1 and
trendelenburg et al., 1994a) than at a2c binding sites in ok
cells (pkd 7.8 for  xxxd3000xxx  and 7.9 for arc 239; simonneaux
et al., 1991). with similar low affinities of  xxxd3000xxx  and arc
239 at the brain cortex a2-autoreceptors, 300 nm probably was
too low a concentration to counteract the inhibitory effect of
clonidine. only further studies, including discriminative compounds, will show whether or not the a2-autoreceptors in brain
cortex are similar to those in right atrium and kidney.
in conclusion, the presynaptic a2-autoreceptors in human
right atrium are a2c. in this they agree with the autoreceptors
in the human kidney. it has been proposed that noradrenergic
neurones predominantly express the ortholog a2a/d gene to
control transmitter release through presynaptic x2-autoreceptors, in all mammals. the two-fold a2c classification in
human tissue seems to exclude the human species from this
rule. the general a2a/ character of the presynaptic a2-autoreceptors is probably true only for species of the order lagomorpha (e.g. rabbit) and of the order rodentia (e.g. rat, mouse,
guinea-pig). in order to obtain any general rule concerning the
subtype of the human presynaptic a2-autoreceptor, additional
tissues need to be investigated.
