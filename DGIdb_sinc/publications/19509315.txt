abstract
 xxxd3497xxx  is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets
the ␣4␤7 integrin exclusively, and modulates inflammation in the
gastrointestinal tract without inducing the systemic immunosuppression that characterizes anti-␣4 chain monoclonal antibodies, such as natalizumab. this unique pharmacologic profile
is largely attributable to four determinants. the first determinant
is the restriction of the expression of the ␣4␤7 integrin to subsets of leukocytes.  xxxd3497xxx  does not bind to the majority
of memory cd4⫹ t lymphocytes (60%), neutrophils, and most
monocytes. the highest level of  xxxd3497xxx  binding is to a
subset (⬃25%) of human peripheral blood memory cd4⫹ t
lymphocytes that include gut-homing interleukin 17 t-helper
lymphocytes.  xxxd3497xxx  also binds to eosinophils at high
levels, and to naive t-helper lymphocytes, naive and memory
cytotoxic t lymphocytes, b lymphocytes, natural killer cells,

the inflammatory bowel diseases (ibds), ulcerative colitis
(uc) and crohn’s disease (cd), are chronic diseases of the
gastrointestinal (gi) tract characterized by an exacerbated
inflammatory cell infiltrate in the gut mucosal tissue (xavier
and podolsky, 2007). multiple inflammatory cell types, including neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes, participate in the pathogenesis of ibd, with lymphocytes having a central role in the induction and
maintenance of the chronic inflammatory process in the lamina propria (xavier and podolsky, 2007). infiltration of the gi
tract by t lymphocytes is a well documented pathogenic
mechanism of ibd, and the molecular mechanisms by which
this work was supported by millennium pharmaceuticals inc.
some of these data were presented at the 2008 advances in inflammatory
bowel diseases crohn’s and colitis foundation’s clinical and research conference; 2008 dec 4 –7; hollywood, fl; and at the 4th congress of the european
crohn’s and colitis organisation; 2009 feb 5–7; hamburg, germany.

and basophils at lower levels;  xxxd3497xxx  binds to memory
cd4⫹ t and b lymphocytes with subnanomolar potency
(ec50 ⫽ 0.3– 0.4 nm). the second determinant is binding specificity;  xxxd3497xxx  binds exclusively to the ␣4␤7 integrin, and
not to the ␣4␤1 and ␣e␤7 integrins. the third determinant is
selective antagonism;  xxxd3497xxx  selectively inhibits adhesion of ␣4␤7-expressing cells to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (median inhibition concentration [ic50] ⫽ 0.02–
0.06 ␮g/ml) and fibronectin (ic50 ⫽ 0.02 ␮g/ml), but not
 xxxg2406xxx . the fourth determinant is the
gastrointestinal-specific tropism of the ␣4␤7 integrin function.
these pharmacologic properties of  xxxd3497xxx , in conjunction
with the gastrointestinal tropism of ␣4␤7 integrin function, may
ultimately confer an improved risk-to-benefit profile for patients
with inflammatory bowel diseases.

these lymphocytes enter the gut are distinct from those in
other peripheral tissues, such as the skin and central nervous system (butcher and picker, 1996; engelhardt et al.,
1998; engelhardt and briskin, 2005; salmi and jalkanen,
2005; agace, 2006). the complex infiltration process in the gi
tract requires the coordinated interaction of several adhesion
and signaling molecules on the surface of t lymphocytes
(selectins, integrins, chemokine receptors) with their corresponding ligands on the endothelium. the ␣4␤7 integrin mediates the infiltration of the gi tract by memory t lymphocytes, binding to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1
(madcam-1) on endothelial cells, and blockade of this interaction provides efficacy in animal models of ibd (hesterberg
et al., 1996; picarella et al., 1997), and in patients with uc
(feagan et al., 2005) and cd (feagan et al., 2008).
the ␣4␤7 integrin is consequently an ideal therapeutic
target for ibd and is currently being targeted through three
different strategies. two of these strategies target either the
␣4 chain or the ␤7 chain. they are not specific for the ␣4␤7

binding and inhibitory properties of  xxxd3497xxx 

integrin and bind to other integrins containing these chains,
specifically the ␣4␤1 and ␣e␤7 integrins. the ␣4␤1 and ␣e␤7
integrins mediate effects within and outside the gi tract. the
␣e␤7 integrin is postulated to locate and retain t lymphocytes within the epithelium of numerous tissues by binding
e-cadherin on the basolateral surface of epithelial cells
(kilshaw, 1999). the ␣4␤1 integrin mediates extravasation of
lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils into numerous
types of tissues by binding to vascular cell adhesion molecule
1 ( xxxg2406xxx ) expressed on the luminal surface of endothelium, and to fibronectin within extracellular matrix (gonzález-amaro et al., 2005). antagonizing the ␣4␤1 or ␣e␤7 integrin thus has a systemic effect.
the humanized anti-␣4 antibody, natalizumab, elicits effects in numerous tissues, including leukocytosis (ghosh et
al., 2003; sandborn et al., 2005; targan et al., 2007), mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells (bonig et al., 2008; zohren
et al., 2008), and inhibition of leukocyte trafficking into the
central nervous system (del pilar martin et al., 2008). indeed, antagonizing both the ␣4␤1 and ␣4␤7 integrins may
explain efficacy in the central nervous system (miller et al.,
2003) and the gi tract, respectively (ghosh et al., 2003;
sandborn et al., 2005; targan et al., 2007). however, administration of natalizumab is associated with systemic immunosuppression; for example, increased incidence of the fatal
infectious disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml) (berger and koralnik, 2005; kleinschmidt-demasters and tyler, 2005; langer-gould et al., 2005; ransohoff, 2005; van assche et al., 2005). it is postulated that the
anti-inflammatory mechanism driving the efficacy of natalizumab in multiple sclerosis may also predispose patients to
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy by decreasing
immunosurveillance in the central nervous system (berger,
2006; berger and houff, 2006; koralnik, 2006; niino et al.,
2006; stüve et al., 2006a,b; del pilar martin et al., 2008).
a third strategy is exclusive targeting of the ␣4␤7 integrin,
which is used by  xxxd3497xxx  (former versions known as
mln0002, mln02, and  xxxd3497xxx ).  xxxd3497xxx  is a humanized version of act-1, a mouse antibody (lazarovits et al.,
1984) that binds to a conformational epitope that is unique to
the heterodimerization of the human ␣4 chain with the ␤7
chain (schweighoffer et al., 1993; tidswell et al., 1997). act-1
therefore binds specifically to the ␣4␤7 integrin, and administration to colitic cotton-top tamarins leads to the resolution
of disease (hesterberg et al., 1996).  xxxd3497xxx  binds to the
␣4␤7 integrin on peripheral blood lymphocytes and inhibits
adhesion of the lymphocyte to madcam-1. humanized act-1
has demonstrated statistically significant efficacy in placebocontrolled phase 2 clinical trials of patients with moderately
active uc (feagan et al., 2005) and in patients with moderately active cd (feagan et al., 2008). the enhanced specificity of  xxxd3497xxx  may ultimately confer an improved riskto-benefit ratio for patients with ibd. the data reported
herein characterize the binding specificity and potency of
 xxxd3497xxx  and the associated selective antagonism of
adhesion.

materials and methods
proteins and antibodies. ninety-six-well plates coated with
recombinant human  xxxg2406xxx /fragment crystallizable (fc) chimera
protein, an alternatively spliced form of human fibronectin contain-

ing the cs-1 peptide, and unlabeled blocking antibodies to human
 xxxg2406xxx , ␣4 and ␤1 were obtained from r&d systems (minneapolis,
mn). a madcam-1/mfc fusion protein was available in-house. fluorochrome-conjugated anti-mouse igg was purchased from jackson
immunoresearch laboratories (west grove, pa). pharmlyse buffer
was obtained from bd biosciences (san jose, ca). fluorochromeconjugated antibodies to human proteins were purchased from various sources: mouse antibodies to cd4 (l200), cd8 (sk1), cd14
(m␸p9),  xxxg375xxx  (hib19), cd45r0 (uchl1),  xxxg1203xxx  (␣4; l25), cd56
(ncam16.2), and cd103 (␣e; ber-act8) and a rat antibody to ␤7
(fib504) from bd biosciences (san jose, ca); mouse antibody to
cd29 (␤1; mem-101a) from ebioscience (san diego, ca); mouse
antibody to  xxxg1178xxx  (ac145) from miltenyi biotech (auburn, ca);
mouse antibodies to  xxxg1203xxx  (␣4; 2b4), cd29 (␤1; p5d2), and  xxxg2406xxx 
(hae-2z) from r&d systems. unconjugated antibodies to the ␣4␤7
integrin, namely act-1 (mouse) and  xxxd3497xxx  (humanized act-1),
and a humanized control antibody with a different antigen specificity
but the same fc igg1 domain as  xxxd3497xxx , were available inhouse, in addition to alexa fluor 647-conjugated  xxxd3497xxx  or
biotin-act-1. primary antibodies for the human tissue cross-reactivity investigation were rabbit anti- xxxd3497xxx  (generated in-house),
anti-␤2-microglobulin (dako north america, inc., carpinteria, ca),
and a negative control human igg1 (millipore bioscience research
reagents, temecula, ca).
cell lines and culture media. the human b-cell lymphoma
cell line, rpmi8866 (stably expressing ␣4␤7), was a kind gift from dr.
david erle (university of california, san francisco). the human
b-cell lymphoma cell line, ramos (stably expressing ␣4␤1, originally sourced from the american type culture collection, manassas,
va), and ␣e␤7 l1.2 cell transfectants were generated in-house by use
of cdna provided by christina parker and michael brenner
(brigham and women’s hospital, boston, ma). culture medium for
rpmi8866 and ramos cell lines consisted of rpmi 1640 medium
supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% l-glutamine
(invitrogen, carlsbad, ca), and 10% us-defined fetal bovine serum
(hyclone laboratories, logan, ut). culture medium for ␣e␤7 transfectants consisted of rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with 1%
penicillin/streptomycin, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% l-glutamine, and 2
␮g/ml  xxxd3041xxx  (invitrogen), 0.1% ␤- xxxd26xxx  (sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo), and 10% us-defined fetal bovine serum (hyclone laboratories).
immunohistochemistry of normal human tissues. the
binding specificity of  xxxd3497xxx  in 38 different types of normal
human tissues (three independent donors per tissue type) was investigated by immunohistochemistry. the quality of these tissues
was verified by robust staining with a positive-control antibody
against ␤2-microglobulin (dako north america, inc.). sections (5 ␮m)
were cut from fresh-frozen tissue samples embedded in oct compound (sakura finetek usa, inc., torrance, ca) and fixed in acetone
for 10 min at room temperature. just before staining, slides were
fixed for 10 s in 10% neutral buffered formalin. acetone/formalinfixed cryosections were rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline
(pbs) and incubated for 20 min with a protein block (pbs; 0.5%
casein; 5% human gamma globulins; 0.02% goat igg; 1 mg/ml heataggregated  xxxd2207xxx ) designed to reduce nonspecific binding. unconjugated  xxxd3497xxx  or a negative control human igg1 (millipore
bioscience research reagents) were applied to sections at 2 or 20
␮g/ml and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. the slides were
then rinsed twice with pbs and an indirect immunoperoxidase procedure was performed to detect these primary reagents. the secondary antibody, rabbit anti- xxxd3497xxx , was then applied at 5 ␮g/ml
for 30 min and rinsed twice with pbs. endogenous peroxidase was
blocked by incubating the slides for 5 min with the peroxidase solution provided in the dako envision⫹ kit and then rinsing twice with
pbs. the slides were then treated for 30 min with the peroxidaselabeled goat anti-rabbit igg polymer supplied in the dako envision⫹ kit, rinsed twice with pbs, and treated for 8 min with the
substrate-chromogen (dab⫹) solution supplied in the dako envi-

sion⫹ kit. all slides were rinsed with tap water, counterstained with
hematoxylin, washed, “blued” in saturated lithium carbonate,
washed, dehydrated through alcohols, cleared in xylene, and coverslipped. staining intensity was graded semiquantitatively by a
board-certified anatomic pathologist.
staining of cell lines and whole blood. for the staining of
cell lines, cells were resuspended at 2 ⫻ 106/ml in facs buffer (5%
fetal bovine serum and 0.05% sodium azide in d-pbs (dulbecco’s
phosphate buffers saline without calcium and magnesium) (vwr,
west chester, pa) and 200-␮l samples were stained with the appropriate monoclonal antibodies (see “proteins and antibodies”) at 4°c
for 30 min. samples were washed with facs buffer and analyzed by
flow cytometry (facscalibur, bd). for the staining of human whole
blood, 200-␮l samples from healthy human volunteers were stained
with the appropriate monoclonal antibody at 4°c for 30 min. red
blood cells were lysed with bd facs lysing solution, and samples
then washed with facs buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry. in
all cases, antibodies were used at saturating concentrations and, in
many cases, up to four antibodies were used per sample. appropriate
single- or two-color control stains were also performed.
saturation and competitive binding analyses. the potency
of  xxxd3497xxx  binding to human leukocytes was examined through
the generation of 1) antibody saturation binding curves with labeled
 xxxd3497xxx  or act-1, and 2) antibody binding competition curves for
the competing binding of labeled antibody with unlabeled antibodies
( xxxd3497xxx , act-1, or isotype control igg). experiments were performed in 96-well v-bottom plates (corning inc., corning, ny). for
saturation binding experiments and determination of ec50 values,
100 ␮l of human peripheral blood from healthy human volunteers
was incubated with the labeled antibody at the indicated range of
concentrations in a final volume of 200 ␮l. in these saturation experiments, at all concentrations tested, specific binding was demonstrated by competition with 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled antibody. for binding competition experiments, 100 ␮l of human
peripheral blood was incubated with the labeled antibody at its ec50
and the unlabeled antibody at the indicated range of concentrations
in a final volume of 200 ␮l. plates were incubated at 4°c for 30min
and cells were then washed. red blood cells were lysed, washed, and
stained with antibodies specific for memory cd4⫹ t lymphocytes
(cd4, cd45ro) and b lymphocytes ( xxxg375xxx ). binding to either memory cd4⫹ t or b lymphocytes was examined by flow cytometry with
use of a facscalibur flow cytometer and cellquest pro software.
the geometric mean fluorescence intensity (gmfi) values of the
positive memory cd4⫹ t-lymphocyte population or the entire blymphocyte population were plotted against antibody concentration.
in binding competition experiments, gmfi data were plotted as
percentage inhibition versus antibody concentration. ec50 (for saturation binding curves) or median inhibition concentration (ic50; for
inhibition of binding curves) values were determined from these
graphs by use of graphpad prism version 4 (graphpad software
inc., san diego, ca) nonlinear regression curve fits.
intracellular staining of  xxxg1166xxx . memory t-helper 17
(th17) cells (cd4⫹cd45ro⫹ xxxg1166xxx ⫹) were identified from peripheral blood of healthy donors. peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(pbmcs) were isolated from heparinized human blood by standard
density-gradient procedures with use of  xxxd3253xxx -paque plus (ge
healthcare, little chalfont, buckinghamshire, uk). pbmcs were
resuspended in assay buffer for cd4 memory cell interleukin (il)
17a intracellular staining (ebioscience) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. pbmcs were stimulated (or not stimulated, for
the control samples) with 50 ng/ml  xxxd2925xxx 
(sigma-aldrich) and 1 ␮g/ml  xxxd2379xxx  (sigma-aldrich) in the presence of 3 ␮m monensin (sigma-aldrich) for 5 h at 37°c. after washing, cells were stained with fluorescent-labeled antibodies:  xxxd3497xxx , anti-␣4 ( xxxg1203xxx ; 9f10) and anti-␤7 (fib504), anti-cd4
( xxxg1266xxx ), and anti-cd45ro (uchl1), where applicable, at 4°c for 30
min. cells were then washed with cold pbs and resuspended in
fixation and permeabilization working solution (ebioscience) stain-

ing buffer at 4°c for 30 min. after fixation and permeabilization,
cells were washed with permeabilization buffer (ebioscience) and
blocked with 10% normal rat serum at 4°c for 10 min. after the
blocking step, cells were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antiil17a antibody (ebioscience) at 4°c for 30 min. finally, cells were
washed with permeabilization buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry
in a facscalibur with cellquest pro software. the memory th17
population was examined for expression of the ␣4␤7 integrin and the
␣4 and ␤7 chains. some experiments were performed with isolated
cd4⫹ memory t lymphocytes (miltenyi biotech) with very similar
results to those with pbmcs.
adhesion assays. for madcam-1 and  xxxg2406xxx  experiments,
96-well elisa plates (thermo fisher scientific, waltham, ma) were
prepared 24 h in advance by coating with 100 ␮l of 2 ␮g/ml recombinant protein diluted in pbs at 4°c. for fibronectin experiments,
commercially available precoated plates were used (see “proteins and
antibodies”). on the assay day, the coating solution was removed
before blocking with blocking buffer [0.5% bovine  xxxg124xxx 
(bsa), sigma-aldrich, in pbs] at 37°c (5% co2/95% o2) for 1 h.
experiments on low- and high-affinity binding to integrins were
performed in the absence or presence of mn2⫹, respectively; mn2⫹
was added to induce the high-affinity conformation of the integrin.
assay buffer for low-affinity experiments was rpmi 1640 medium,
0.1% bsa, 10 mm hepes, ph 7, and for high-affinity experiments
was 1 mm mn2⫹, dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium, 0.1% bsa, 10
mm hepes, ph 7. for dose-dependent antibody inhibition curves,
antibodies were diluted and cells resuspended in the indicated corresponding assay buffers for low- or high-affinity binding conditions.
premixed cell-antibody samples (100 ␮l at 2 ⫻ 106 cells/ml) were
added to the protein-coated plates after removal of the blocking
buffer. plates were incubated at 37°c (5% co2/95% o2) for 1 h,
washed two to five times with pbs, and adhered cells were detected
by adding alamarblue (trek diagnostic systems, cleveland, oh).
plates were incubated at 37°c (5% co2/95% o2) for 4 h and read by
a fluorescence reader (molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca). experiments were performed in triplicate, included isotype control antibodies, and were repeated at least three times. relative fluorescence
units were plotted against antibody concentration and ic50 values
were determined from these graphs by use of graphpad prism version 4 nonlinear regression curve fits.
inhibition of madcam-1 binding to cd4ⴙ memory t lymphocytes.  xxxd3497xxx  inhibition of high-affinity binding of madcam-1 to human peripheral blood memory cd4⫹ t lymphocytes was
tested. peripheral blood (90 ␮l) was incubated with a saturating
concentration (3 ␮g/ml) of madcam-1-murine-fc fusion protein and
4 mm mncl2 in a final volume of 100 ␮l for 1 h at room temperature,
in the presence or absence of  xxxd3497xxx . this saturating concentration was determined from previous madcam-1-fc protein binding saturation curves with three independent donors. after washing
with assay buffer (25 mm tris, 4 mm mncl2, 2.7 mm kcl, 150 mm
nacl, 0.5% bsa, ph 7.2), the cells were stained with fluorescentlabeled anti-mouse igg for 15 min at room temperature. after washing again, cells were incubated with mouse serum for 10 min at room
temperature, followed by staining with anti-cd4 and anti-cd45ro
antibodies for 15 min at room temperature. after washing, red blood
cells were lysed with bd facs lysing solution and analyzed by flow
cytometry in a facscalibur with cellquest pro software. antibody
dose-dependent inhibition curves were obtained by plotting the percentage of memory cd4⫹ t lymphocytes that bound madcam-1
versus antibody concentration with use of graphpad prism version
4. ic50 values were determined from these graphs with use of graphpad prism version 4 nonlinear regression curve fits.

chemistry. binding of  xxxd3497xxx  was restricted to the cell
membrane of mononuclear cells in lymphoid tissues, mononuclear infiltrates in tissues of the gi tract and bladder, and
mononuclear cells in the lumens of blood vessels (table 1). in
gi tract tissues,  xxxd3497xxx  bound mononuclear cells organized in submucosal lymphoid nodules and/or scattered in
lamina propria. the large and small intestine contained the
highest frequency of mononuclear cells that were bound by
 xxxd3497xxx  (data not shown).
binding specificity of  xxxd3497xxx  to human leukocytes ex vivo. flow cytometry experiments were performed on human peripheral blood stained with  xxxd3497xxx 
or act-1, anti-␣4- and anti-␤1-monoclonal antibodies (mabs),

and markers of leukocyte subsets (including memory and
naive cd4 and cd8 t lymphocytes, b lymphocytes, natural
killer cells, monocytes, basophils, eosinophils, and neutrophils). experiments were designed so that coexpression of the
␣4␤1 and ␣4␤7 integrins and binding of  xxxd3497xxx  to subsets expressing the ␣4␤1 integrin could also be examined.
 xxxd3497xxx  bound to the majority of b lymphocytes, naive
cd4 and cd8 t lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and basophils at low to intermediate levels (fig. 1, a and b).  xxxd3497xxx  bound to b lymphocytes at intermediate levels uniformly, to natural killer cells and basophils at low levels
uniformly, and to naive cd4 and cd8 t lymphocytes from
low to intermediate levels.  xxxd3497xxx  bound to approxi-

fig. 1. binding specificity of  xxxd3497xxx  to human leukocytes. human peripheral blood was stained with  xxxd3497xxx  and antibodies specific for the
various leukocyte subsets and examined by flow cytometry. a, flow cytometry plots illustrating  xxxd3497xxx  binding to various subsets of leukocytes,
identified by gating on the appropriate cellular markers.  xxxd3497xxx  binding is plotted against forward scatter, with the horizontal line indicating
the level of background signal as determined from a negative control antibody. data are from at least five unrelated, healthy donors. b, the geometric
mean fluorescence intensity of  xxxd3497xxx  binding to various subsets of leukocytes. gating is restricted to the population of the leukocytes that stains
positively with  xxxd3497xxx . data are the means from five unrelated, healthy donors with standard deviations indicated by the error bars. gmfi

mately 25% of the memory (cd45ro⫹) cd4⫹ t lymphocytes
at high levels (␣4␤7hi) and to 5 to 10% at intermediate levels,
and not to the rest of the population (figs. 1, a and b, and
2a).  xxxd3497xxx  bound to the majority of the naive
(cd45ro⫺) cd4⫹ and cd8⫹ t lymphocytes, and to approximately 50% of the memory (cd45ro⫹) cd8⫹ t lymphocytes, at low to intermediate levels (fig. 1, a and b, and 2a).
 xxxd3497xxx  bound to all eosinophils at intermediate to high
levels, and to approximately15% of monocytes at low levels,
but did not bind to neutrophils (fig. 1, a and b). the highest
level of binding by  xxxd3497xxx  was observed on the ␣4␤7hi
population of memory cd45ro⫹ cd4⫹ t lymphocytes (fig.
1b). the specificity of binding to the ␣4␤7 integrin by  xxxd3497xxx  was verified by competition with act-1; unlabeled
act-1 completely inhibited binding of  xxxd3497xxx  on all
leukocyte subsets examined (data not shown). the same an-

tigen specificity between these two antibodies was also demonstrated by the complete inhibition of labeled act-1 binding
to all leukocytes exposed to unlabeled  xxxd3497xxx .
the binding profile of  xxxd3497xxx  contrasts the expression profile of the ␣4␤1 integrin. expression of the ␣4␤1 integrin, in general, was more widespread than binding by  xxxd3497xxx .  xxxd3497xxx  bound naive cd4⫹ t lymphocytes at
varying levels (fig. 2a), whereas these cells expressed the
␣4␤1 integrin uniformly (fig. 2b).  xxxd3497xxx  bound to a
specific subset of the memory cd4⫹ t-lymphocyte population;  xxxd3497xxx  bound approximately 25% of memory
cd4⫹ t lymphocytes at high levels (fig. 2a), whereas most of
these cells expressed relatively high levels of the ␣4 and/or ␤1
chains (fig. 2b). three major subsets of memory cd4⫹ t
lymphocytes can be defined by ␣4␤1 integrin expression: ␣4⫺,
␣4hi␤1hi, and ␣4hi␤1lo.  xxxd3497xxx  binds to most (⬃80%) of the

binding and inhibitory properties of  xxxd3497xxx

fig. 2. a comparison of the binding of
 xxxd3497xxx  to expression of the ␣4 and
␤1 chains by human cd4⫹ t lymphocytes and monocytes. human peripheral blood was stained with the indicated antibodies and examined by flow
cytometry. a, blood was stained with
 xxxd3497xxx , and anti-cd4 and anticd45ro antibodies. these plots illustrate the binding of  xxxd3497xxx  in the
total (cd4⫹), naive (cd4⫹cd45ro⫺),
and memory (cd4⫹cd45ro⫹) cd4⫹
t-cell subsets. the box indicates the
level of background signal of the negative population, and the horizontal line
denotes the ␣4␤7hi population. b, blood
was stained with anti-cd4, -cd45ro,
-␣4, and -␤1 antibodies. these plots illustrate the coexpression of the ␣4 and
␤1 chains in the total, naive, and memory cd4⫹ t-cell subsets. c, blood was
stained with  xxxd3497xxx , and anticd4, -␣4, and -␤1 antibodies.  xxxd3497xxx  binding was examined in the
three ␣4⫹␤1⫹ cd4⫹ memory t-cell populations of the total cd4⫹ t-cell plot
of b: ␣4hi␤1lo (i), ␣4hi␤1hi (ii), and ␣4lo␤1hi
(iii). d, blood was stained with  xxxd3497xxx  and anti-cd14 antibodies. this
plot illustrates the binding of  xxxd3497xxx  to monocytes. e, specificity of
binding was demonstrated by competition with act-1. f, blood was stained
with anti-cd14, -␣4, and -␤1 antibodies.
this plot illustrates coexpression of ␣4
and ␤1 by monocytes. all data are representative of at least five unrelated,
healthy donors.

␣4hi␤1lo t-helper lymphocytes at high levels (fig. 2c); this is
the subset that contains the majority of the ␣4␤7hi subset. in
contrast, the majority (⬃90%) of ␣4hi␤1hi and all ␣4lo␤1hi t-helper
lymphocytes are not bound by  xxxd3497xxx  (fig. 2c). likewise, a majority (⬃85%) of monocytes are not bound by
 xxxd3497xxx  (fig. 2, d and e), but express relatively high
levels of the ␣4␤1 integrin (fig. 2f).

 xxxd3497xxx  specificity for the ␣4␤7 integrin versus
the ␣4␤1 and ␣e␤7 integrins. the specificity of  xxxd3497xxx  binding for the integrin ␣4␤7 versus ␣4␤1 in whole
blood is illustrated by comparing two subsets of leukocytes
that express high levels of the ␣4␤1 integrin but do not bind
 xxxd3497xxx , specifically the ␣4␤1hi subset of the memory
cd4 population (fig. 2b, plot 1, quadrant ii) and monocytes

that express exclusively the ␣4␤7 (a and b), ␣4␤1 (c and d), and ␣e␤7 (e and f) integrins. the flow cytometry plots represent at least three
independent experiments.

(fig. 2f).  xxxd3497xxx  did not bind the vast majority of cells
in either ␣4␤1hi populations (fig. 2c, plot ii, and d, respectively). the lack of binding by  xxxd3497xxx  was maintained
up to a concentration of 400 ␮g/ml (data not shown). the
analysis of the specificity of  xxxd3497xxx  for the ␣4␤7 integrin
versus ␣e␤7 in whole blood by flow cytometry was not possible because all the ␣e␤7-expressing cells are contained within
the ␣4␤7hi subset. the specificity of binding to integrins containing the ␣4 and/or ␤7 chains by  xxxd3497xxx  was investigated further with cell lines expressing the ␣4␤1, ␣4␤7, or
␣e␤7 integrins exclusively.  xxxd3497xxx  bound to rpmi8866
cells (fig. 3a) that expressed the ␣4 and ␤7 chains (fig. 3b)
but not the ␤1 or ␣e chains (not shown). incubation with
act-1 competed with the binding of  xxxd3497xxx  to
rpmi8866 cells, confirming the specificity of binding to the
␣4␤7 integrin (data not shown).  xxxd3497xxx  did not bind to
ramos cells (fig. 3c) that expressed the ␣4 and ␤1 chains
(fig. 3d) but not the ␤7 chain (data not shown), nor to mouse
l1.2 cell transfectants (fig. 3e) that expressed the human ␣e
and ␤7 chains (fig. 3, e and f), but not the human ␣4 chain
(data not shown).
characterization of the memory cd4 t lymphocyte
population for expression of the ␣4␤1 and ␣4␤7 integrins and  xxxg1166xxx . a subset (⬃20%) of the th17 cell population in peripheral blood was bound by  xxxd3497xxx  (fig. 4),
and similar data were obtained for expression of the ␤7 chain
(data not shown). in contrast, the majority (80%) of the

memory th17 cell population expressed the ␣4 chain (␣4⫹␤1⫹
and ␣4⫹␤7⫹; fig. 4). the th17 cell population therefore consists of three major subsets: ␣4⫺ (20%), ␣4␤1hi (60%), and
␣4␤7hi (20%).
potency of binding of  xxxd3497xxx  to b and memory
cd4ⴙ t lymphocytes. the potency of  xxxd3497xxx  for
binding to human peripheral blood b and memory cd4⫹
lymphocytes was estimated from saturation binding curves
in experiments with labeled  xxxd3497xxx  (fig. 5a). the ec50
values were 0.067 ␮g/ml (0.4 nm) and 0.042 ␮g/ml (0.3 nm)
for b and memory cd4⫹ lymphocytes, respectively. the potency of  xxxd3497xxx  for binding to human peripheral blood
b and memory cd4⫹ lymphocytes was also estimated from
competitive binding experiments in which binding of labeled
 xxxd3497xxx  at its ec50 was competed off by unlabeled  xxxd3497xxx  (fig. 5b). the mean ic50 values were 0.045 ␮g/ml
(0.3 nm) and 0.044 ␮g/ml (0.3 nm) for b and memory cd4⫹
lymphocytes, respectively. similar results were obtained
with act-1; the ic50 values for act-1 binding were 0.062
␮g/ml (0.010 nm) and 0.059 ␮g/ml (0.008 nm) for b and
memory cd4⫹ lymphocytes, respectively (data not shown).
 xxxd3497xxx  inhibits adhesion of ␣4␤7ⴙ cells to
madcam-1 and fibronectin but not to  xxxg2406xxx . the
neutralizing potency and specificity of  xxxd3497xxx  was determined in cell adhesion assays with ␣4␤7-expressing
rpmi8866 cells and the cell adhesion proteins, madcam-1,
 xxxg2406xxx , and the alternatively spliced form of fibronectin

humanized mab negative control (fig. 6, a, b, and f) and the
murine isotype-matched negative control (fig. 6, a–f) had no
effect on adhesion. the effect of  xxxd3497xxx  on the binding
of madcam-1 to t lymphocytes in human whole blood was
also evaluated by flow cytometry.  xxxd3497xxx  inhibited the
binding of soluble human madcam-1-fc fusion protein to

anti-␣4-mab, anti-␤1-mab, and a combination thereof, inhibited all adhesion between ␣4␤1-expressing ramos cells and
 xxxg2406xxx  (fig. 8, a–d).  xxxd3497xxx  did not inhibit adhesion
of ␣4␤1-expressing ramos cells to fibronectin at 400 ␮g/ml,

discussion

infiltration of the gi tract by t lymphocytes is a pathogenic mechanism of uc and cd (xavier and podolsky, 2007).
migration into the gi tract is a complex, multistep process
requiring the coordinated interaction of several adhesion and
signaling molecules (selectins, integrins, chemokine receptors) on the surface of t lymphocytes, with their corresponding ligands on the endothelium (salmi and jalkanen, 2005).
the ␣4␤7 integrin is a pivotal mediator of infiltration of gi
tract by t lymphocytes and antagonizing its adhesion to
madcam-1 provides efficacy in animal models of ibd (hesterberg et al., 1996; picarella et al., 1997) and in patients
with uc (feagan et al., 2005, 2008) and cd (feagan et al.,
2005, 2008). these investigations also demonstrated that
antagonizing the ␣4␤7 integrin is well tolerated. the absence
of overt deleterious effects is partially attributable to  xxxd3497xxx  binding exclusively to leukocytes. this binding profile is consistent with the expression profile of the human
␣4␤7 integrin (schweighoffer et al., 1993; erle et al., 1994;
farstad et al., 1997; rott et al., 2000).

cd4 memory t-lymphocyte population in human peripheral blood in
vitro. blood was stained with madcam-1-fc, with or without  xxxd3497xxx , and with anti-cd4 and anti-cd45ro antibodies. madcam-1-fc
binding to the cd4 memory t-lymphocyte population was analyzed by
flow cytometry. results are reported as the percentage of the total cd4
memory t-lymphocyte population that bound madcam-1 versus  xxxd3497xxx  concentration. data are the mean of three independent donors.

this desirable profile encouraged targeting the ␣4␤7 integrin by three different therapeutic strategies. one of these
strategies targets the ␤7 chain of the integrin and, consequently, inhibits both the ␣4␤7 and ␣e␤7 adhesion pathways
thereby inhibiting the localization and retention of t lymphocytes within epithelial layers in numerous tissues (kilshaw,
1999). this could potentially elicit systemic effects, perturbing immunosurveillance of normal epithelial tissue and re-

ducing inflammation in diseased tissue. the second strategy
targets the ␣4 chain and inhibits both the ␣4␤7 and ␣4␤1
integrins. the ␣4␤1 integrin is expressed by all leukocytes
except neutrophils (gonzález-amaro et al., 2005), and antagonism by natalizumab inhibits adhesion of the ␣4␤1 integrin
to  xxxg2406xxx , fibronectin, and osteopontin, and the adhesion of
the ␣4␤7 integrin to madcam-1,  xxxg2406xxx , and fibronectin
(biogen idec, 2006). the ␣4␤1 integrin mediates adhesion in
many different types of tissue, and inhibition by natalizumab
therefore induces diverse systemic effects, such as mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells from the bone marrow
(bonig et al., 2008; zohren et al., 2008), leukocytosis in the
vasculature (ghosh et al., 2003; sandborn et al., 2005; targan et al., 2007), and reduction in the number of leukocytes
in cerebral spinal fluid (stüve et al., 2006a,b) and cerebral
tissue (del pilar martin et al., 2008). this diverse profile of
physiologic effects may confer efficacy in pathologically distinct diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (miller et al., 2003)
and cd (ghosh et al., 2003; sandborn et al., 2005; targan et
al., 2007). repeated administration of natalizumab to patients with multiple sclerosis and cd, however, is also associated with systemic immunosuppression, including an increased incidence of the fatal infectious disease, pml
(kleinschmidt-demasters and tyler, 2005; langer-gould et
al., 2005; van assche et al., 2005). it is postulated that the
anti-inflammatory mechanism that mediates efficacy of natalizumab in multiple sclerosis and cd may also predispose
patients to pml by decreasing immunosurveillance in the

binding and inhibitory properties of  xxxd3497xxx

central nervous system (berger and houff, 2006; stüve et al.,
2006a,b; del pilar martin et al., 2008). natalizumab may
prevent the entry of memory t lymphocytes into the brain
and perhaps into sites of viral latency, thereby precluding t
lymphocytes from clearing or suppressing the viral infection
(berger, 2006; stüve et al., 2006b; del pilar martin et al.,
2008).
 xxxd3497xxx  uses a third strategy: exclusive targeting of
the ␣4␤7 integrin.  xxxd3497xxx  binds to the ␣4␤7 integrin,
but not to the ␣4␤1 or ␣e␤7 integrins (figs. 2 and 3). this
specificity was confirmed in functional assays demonstrating
that  xxxd3497xxx  inhibits adhesion of ␣4␤7-expressing cells
exclusively (figs. 6 and 7), but not of ␣4␤1-expressing cells
exclusively (fig. 8). these data agree with immunoprecipitation experiments that utilized act-1 (schweighoffer et al.,
1993). specifically targeting the ␣4␤7 integrin enables  xxxd3497xxx  to immunomodulate the gi tract without systemic
effects, due to the gi-specific role of the ␣4␤7 integrin in
mediating infiltration by leukocytes (butcher et al., 1999;
engelhardt and briskin, 2005; agace, 2006). this strategy
does not elicit leukocytosis in uc and cd patients, and has
demonstrated an excellent clinical safety profile to date
(feagan et al., 2005, 2008).
another component of the unique pharmacologic activity of
 xxxd3497xxx  could be selective inhibition of cellular activity.
 xxxd3497xxx  selectively inhibits the adhesion of cells expressing the ␣4␤7 integrin to madcam-1 and fibronectin, but
not to  xxxg2406xxx  (figs. 6 and 7). these data are consistent with
qualitative reports for the effect of act-1 on adhesion of b and
t lymphocytes to these ligands (postigo et al., 1993; schweighoffer et al., 1993; erle et al., 1994; walsh et al., 1996).

differences in expression of integrin chains between memory cd4⫹ t lymphocytes also contribute to the unique clinical profile of  xxxd3497xxx . circulating effector memory cd4⫹
t lymphocytes can be divided into three subpopulations according to expression of the ␣4 and ␤1 chains: 1) 20% that do
not express the ␣4 chain (fig. 2b); 2) 50% that express high
levels of ␣4 and ␤1 chains (fig. 2b) that would be bound by an
anti-␣4-therapeutic but not by  xxxd3497xxx  (fig. 2c), and
3) 30% that express high levels of the ␣4␤7 integrin and low
levels of the ␤1 chain (fig. 2c) that would be bound by both
an anti-␣4-therapeutic and  xxxd3497xxx . the cd4⫹ memory
␣4␤7hi population is postulated to be pathogenic in ibd
(butcher et al., 1999; salmi and jalkanen, 2005), and the
clinical efficacy of natalizumab in cd and  xxxd3497xxx  in cd
and uc buttress this paradigm (ghosh et al., 2003; feagan et
al., 2005, 2008; sandborn et al., 2005).  xxxd3497xxx  specifically targets the cd4⫹ memory subpopulation that is pathogenic in ibd (␣4␤7hi), while sparing other cd4⫹ memory
subpopulations (␣4␤1hi) and monocytes (fig. 2) that are integral for immunosurveillance and host defense.
we discovered that  xxxd3497xxx  binds to a subset (⬃20%)
of th17 cells that express the gut-tropic ␣4␤7hi phenotype
(fig. 4). this proinflammatory subset is found in numerous
types of inflamed tissue and is postulated to mediate many
different autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis, psoriatic
arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, transplant
rejection, and tumor immunotherapy (iwakura and ishigame, 2006).  xxxd3038xxx  plays an important role in the maintenance
and function of the th17 subset of cd4 memory t lymphocytes. single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the human  xxxd3038xxx 
receptor gene are associated with increased risk and  xxxd2497xxx -

soler et al.

tion from cd (duerr et al., 2006). ustekinumab is a therapeutic antibody targeting the human p40 subunit of the il-12
and  xxxd3038xxx  cytokines, and is efficacious in cd (sandborn et al.,
2008) and psoriasis (leonardi et al., 2008; papp et al., 2008).
it seems that  xxxd3497xxx  targets only a subset (20%) of the
th17 cells, namely the gi-tropic, ␣4␤7hi subset and thus could
provide efficacy in ibd more specifically than ustekinumab,
conferring an improved clinical risk-to-benefit profile in patients with ibd.
targeting systemic mediators of inflammation, such as
␣4hi␤1hi t cells and th17 cells, inhibits systemic immunosurveillance, which may predispose patients to infection and/or
neoplasia (engelhardt and briskin, 2005; ransohoff, 2005;
iwakura and ishigame, 2006; wei et al., 2006; mottet and
golshayan, 2007). the role of the ␣4␤7 integrin in immunosurveillance, in contrast, is restricted to the gi tract (butcher
et al., 1999; salmi and jalkanen, 2005; agace, 2006). gutspecific immunomodulation by  xxxd3497xxx  is hence less
likely to predispose patients to infection and/or neoplasia
outside of the gi tract than anti-␣4, anti-␤7, and anti-p40
(il-12/ xxxd3038xxx ) subunit therapeutics. the specificity of  xxxd3497xxx  for gi-tropic t lymphocytes offers clinical efficacy in
ibd (feagan et al., 2005, 2008) without some of the undesirable systemic effects characteristic of natalizumab and
ustekinumab. the ability to modulate inflammation specifically within the gi tract, without systemic immunosuppression, is likely to confer efficacy in ibd with an improved
safety profile and risk-to-benefit ratio.
