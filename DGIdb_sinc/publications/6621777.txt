injection of l- xxxd3459xxx  (800 mg/kg, 2 h) increased the mouse striatal para-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (p-hpaa) concentrations. a smaller dose of d,l-m-tyrosine (20 mg/kg, 2 h) produced a larger increase in mouse striatal meta-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (m-hpaa) concentrations. the administration of lphenylalanine to mice caused a slight increase in the p-hpaa concentrations in
the corpus striatum after 2 h while a larger dose of l-phenylalanine (800 mg/kg)
produced a greater increase. eight hours following l-phenylalanine injection, phpaa concentrations were still elevated. with  xxxd1793xxx  a significant increase was observed at eight hours after drug administration.
two drugs which reduce dopamine synthesis, a-methyl-para-tyrosine and apomorphine, decreased m-hpaa striatal concentrations without affecting p-hpaa
concentrations. from these results, it is proposed that  xxxg2276xxx  activity determines p-hpaa concentrations by regulating  xxxd3459xxx  availability.
this enzyme may also synthesize m-tyrosine which is subsequently decarboxylated to form m-tyramine and then oxidatively deaminated to form m-hpaa.

introduction
in 1908 blum and subsequently flatow, in 1910, measured the elevated
excretion of meta-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (m-hpaa) after the ingespresent address: douglas hospital research centre, 6875 lasalle blvd., verdun, quebec

tion of m-tyrosine by volunteers (1, 2). the parenteral administration of
m-tyrosine to cats also produced increased concentrations of m-hpaa
and m-hydroxyphenylaceturic acid, the major excretion products (3). recently, a thirteen fold increase in mouse striatal m-tyramine (m-ta) concentrations was measured after the subcutaneous injection of m-tyrosine
into mice (4). using histochemical techniques, oster and schlossman, in
1942, demonstrated that  xxxd3459xxx  was converted into p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, the precursor to para-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (phpaa), by the guinea pig kidney (5). the subcutaneous administration
of  xxxd3459xxx  to mice produces a substantial increase in p-tyramine (pta) concentrations in the mouse caudate nucleus (4).
the acid metabolites of the tyramines, p-hpaa and m-hpaa, may be
produced by two possible mechanisms: a) oxidative deamination ofp-ta
and m-ta by monoamine oxidase (mao); b) transamination of the amino
acids,  xxxd3459xxx  and m-tyrosine.
in the mouse brain the highest concentrations ofp-hpaa and m-hpaa
are found in the caudate nucleus (6). the subcutaneous administration of
either p-ta or m-ta results in a large increase in the mouse striatal
concentrations of both p-ta and p-hpaa or m-ta and m-hpaa respectively (6). similarly, the inhibition of mao by  xxxd2850xxx  administration results in a decline in the mouse striatal p-hpaa and m-hpaa concentrations of 75% (6). it would thus appear that of the two mechanisms,
mechanism (a) is of greater importance to the maintenance of p-hpaa
and m-hpaa concentrations within the caudate nucleus. pogrund et al.
(3) as well, had reached this conclusion since the yield of urinary m-hpaa
was much larger after m-ta administration than was the yield after the
injection of the transamination product, m- xxxd40xxx .
this is an investigation of the effects on mouse striatal p-hpaa and
m-hpaa concentrations of various aminoacids and drugs affecting dopamine synthesis.
experimental procedure
drugs. all drugs were dissolved in isotonic saline and subcutaneously injected. the phenylalanine solutions required heating to 80~ before the amino acid completely dissolved.
apomorphine hydrochloride, l-phenylalanine, r)-phenylalanine, d,l-meta- xxxd3459xxx paratyrosine ethyl ester and b,l-a-methyl-ol-para-tyrosine methyl ester were supplied by sigma
chemical co., st. louis, missouri.
materials. ethyl acetate, hexane and methanol were distilled prior to use. methanolichc1 was prepared according to the method of karoum et al. ((7). all other reagents were
of the highest purity available.
animals. male albino swiss mice (20-25 g) were obtained from the animal resource
center, university of saskatchewan. after the various drug treatments, the animals were

decapitated, the brains removed and the corpus striatum, consisting mainly of the head or
the caudate nucleus and including part of the putamen (approximate weights between 33
and 36 rag) dissected. the striata from ten mice were pooled and frozen upon dry ice.
isolation and measurement of the acids. two procedures were used to quantify the acids.
one method involved the use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) (8) for
quantification and the second procedure involved gas chromatography (gc) and electron
capture detection (6). the estimates obtained by either method were not statistically significantly different, thus the statistical analysis of the results was carried out with values
obtained by either of these methods.
in the gc-ms procedure, the tissues were weighed and homogenized in 0.1 m  xxxd3557xxx .
the internal standards, 50 ng each of [2h2]-p-hpaa and [2h2]-mhpaa, were added to the
supernatant and the protein was precipitated using equal volumes of 0.1 m barium hydroxide.
the supernatant was acidified, 2 g of  xxxd3213xxx  added and the acids extracted using
3 â€¢ 5 ml. of ethyl acetate. the solvent was evaporated using a stream of nitrogen and the
residue was transferred to a vial for derivatization. methanolic hc1, 100 pa, was added to
the residue and allowed to stand for 15 minutes. the excess reagent was evaporated by
using nitrogen. heptafluorobutyric anhydride (hfba), 50 ~1, was added and the sample
heated at 50~ for 50 minutes. after careful reduction of the reaction volume by using a
stream of nitrogen, 0.2 ml. of hexane were added and the mixture was washed four times
with 1 m sodium phosphate buffer (ph-6) to remove the underivatized hfba. the hexane
solution was then transferred to another vial and just prior to gc-ms analysis and further
reduced in volume. the samples were quantified by using a double focussing mass spectrometer [vacuum generator (vg) 70-70f] interfaced with a gas chromatograph [hewlettpackard 5710a]. the gc column used was a 50 meter support coated open tubular (scot)
column coated with a mixture of 50 gs and ov-101 (mandel scientific, rockwood, ontario).
the column was rated at approximately 20,000 effective plates. the carrier gas employed
was helium at a pressure of four pounds per square inch. temperatures of the various zones
were: injector 200~ column 180~ isothermal and ion source 200~ m-hpaa-me-hfb
and p-hpaa-me-hfb were eluted at the retention times of approximately 5.2 minutes and
5.7 minutes respectively. the deuterated internal standards were eluted approximately 0.2
minutes earlier than their respective nondeuterated acids. the ions were monitored using
the peak matching facility of the mass spectrometer at a resolution of 5,000.
for the gc technique the p- and m-hydroxyphenylacetic acids were isolated on a deaesephadex a-25 column and quantitated as their pentafluoro-propionyl and hexafluoropropanol esters by use of a gas-chromatograph equipped with an electron-capture detector (6).

results
the subcutaneous administration of l- xxxd3459xxx  (800 mg/kg) produced
a 619% increase in mouse striatal p-hpaa concentration (table i). a
lower dose of d,l-m-tyrosine (20 mg/kg) increased the mouse striatal mhpaa to levels about 57 times higher than in control animals (table 1).
the administration of either l- xxxd3459xxx  nor d,l-m-tyrosine affected the
respective concentrations of m-hpaa or p-hpaa (table i).
two hours following subcutaneous injection of l-phenylalanine (200
mg/kg), p-hpaa had increased to 141% of the control values (table i).
a larger dose of l-phenylalanine (800 mg/kg) similarly produced a larger

large increases in  xxxd3459xxx  concentrations lead to increases in p-tyramine levels as the  xxxd3459xxx  undergoes decarboxylation (4). with the
increases in the p-ta concentration, the greatly increased striatal phpaa concentrations measured after  xxxd3459xxx  administration are not
too surprising (table i). the subcutaneous administration of large
amounts of p-ta leading to increased striatal p-ta concentrations and
subsequently to increased striatal p-hpaa concentrations has been demonstrated previously (6).
ingestion of deuterated tyrosine by a human resulted in the excretion
of deuterated p-ta (13). faull et al. (14) administered deuterated tyrosine
loads to two patients with tyrosinemia and detected the excretion of deuterated p-hpaa. in their control subjects they found only p-hpaa to be
significantly deuterated but in the patients the other metabolites of tyrosine (p-hydroxyphenyllactic acid and  xxxd40xxx )
were also deuterated. since serum concentrations of both deuterated and
nondeuterated tyrosine are also greatly increased, one might expect decarboxylation of both compounds to produce the appropriate tyramines
and, as well, the appropriate acid metabolites. whole rat brain p-hpaa
concentrations were increased three-fold after the intraperitoneal injection of a dose of 200 mg/kg  xxxd3459xxx  (15). following pretreatment with
ro 4-4602, a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor (50 mg/kg, i.p.), the increase in p-hpaa observed after only  xxxd3459xxx  administration alone,
was significantly reduced (to 180% of control) compared to that increase
seen without the ro 4-4602 pretreatment. the decrease in p-hpaa levels
may be due to the inhibition of the decarboxylase found in the brain
capillaries and it was estimated that perhaps 50% of the brain p-ta may
be formed in the brain capillaries (15).
edwards (16) has suggested that the p-hpaa concentrations within the
brain are unreliable as indicators of p-ta metabolism since transamination may contribute to a portion of the measured p-hpaa concentrations.
we disagree with this suggestion as the "total  xxxg2250xxx 
activity" in the brain is from 1 to 10% of that in the liver (17, 18). the
enzyme of the liver is cytoplasmic while the activity in the brain is mitochondrial (18). aspartate transaminase may transaminate tyrosine
within the brain but to only a negligible extent in the presence of aspartate

(18).
injection of meta-tyrosine (20 mg/kg) also greatly increases mouse striatal m-ta concentrations (4). this dose of meta-tyrosine produced a
greater increase in m-hpaa concentrations than a much larger dose of
para-tyrosine (800 mg/kg) produced in the p-hpaa levels (table i). metatyrosine is a much better substrate for l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase than is para-tyrosine (19) and thus it is not surprising that a low

dose of meta-tyrosine produced a comparatively larger increase in mhpaa concentrations, meta-tyrosine has not yet been detected in mammalian tissues (20) but this may be due to its more rapid decarboxylation
or very low synthesis rate.
the production by l-phenylalanine injection of a large increase in phpaa concentrations (table 1) may occur by two possible mechanisms.
high doses of l-phenylalanine injected intraperitoneally in rats produced
large increases in the striatal concentrations ofpara-tyrosine (11).  xxxd3426xxx 
mg/kg dose of l-phenylalanine produced a 327% increase in para-tyrosine
concentrations. presumably this increase occurs as a result of para-hydroxylation of phenylalanine by  xxxg1660xxx  found in the
liver. in humans, fell et al. (20) observed deuterium labeled tyrosine
present in the serum one hour after the oral administration of deuterated
phenylalanine. large doses of phenylalanine (1 gm/kg) triple the brain
concentrations of [3-phenylethylamine (pe) (21) presumably as a result of
increased decarboxylation. this pe might then be hydroxylated to form
p-ta (22) and thus lead to an increase in p-hpaa concentrations. this
might contribute to a portion of the p-hpaa concentrations but may be
of major importance only when pe levels are very high (23).
the synthesis of m-ta might occur as a result of  xxxg2276xxx 
(th) hydroxylating phenylalanine in the brain (24) and thus producing
some meta-tyrosine which is subsequently decarboxylated. this appears
to happen since the injection of phenylalanine causes an increase in mouse
striatal m-ta concentrations (4). no increase in m-hpaa concentration
occurs after l-phenylalanine injection (table i). this suggests that the
synthesized m-ta must reach very high concentrations before increased
m-hpaa concentrations are observed (6). humans who had ingested
semitracer amounts of l-[zhs]phenylalanine, excreted [2h4]-m-hpaa
(25); m-ta formation may occur in the liver, possibly as a result of the
action of  xxxg1660xxx  (25).
 xxxd1793xxx  has been proposed to be efficacious in the treatment
of depression (26). mosnaim et al. (27) have proposed that  xxxd1793xxx 
is directly decarboxylated to form pe. it has been claimed that eight hours
after the administration of 100 mg/kg of  xxxd1793xxx  is more effective
in increasing the brain levels of pe as compared to l-phenylalanine treatment (26). elevated amounts of pe might cause increased p-tyramine
synthesis (23) and subsequently, the p-hpaa concentrations might be
increased in the caudate nucleus. this would provide further evidence
that pe is hydroxylated under normal physiological conditions to form
p-ta as suggested by boulton et al. (22). the results, however, would
tend to disprove these assumptions.  xxxd1793xxx  may first be transaminated to the corresponding keto acid and then reaminated to form

910

mcquade and juorio

l-phenylalanine (26). the l-phenylalanine thus formed would then be metabolized in the identical manner as was the directly injected l-phenylalanine.
 xxxg2276xxx  appears to be the key enzyme in the synthesis
of the tyramines. inhibition of th by a-methyl-para-tyrosine (28) causes
a decline in m-ta concentrations (29) that may be due to synthesis inhibition. the decline in amine levels is accompanied by a decline in mhpaa concentrations (table ii) and thus this decline (of the amine concentrations) is not due to increased release or acid metabolite production.
the decrease in the acid concentration may thus be due to decreased mta availability.
the increase in p-ta concentration seen after th inhibition may be
due to increased para-tyrosine availability since the p-hpaa levels are
unchanged. thus the increase in p-ta concentrations are not due to decreased release of the amine (table ii). this increase in p-ta concentration after a-methyl-para-tyrosine administration was recently confirmed by duffield et al. (30).
the effect produced by apomorphine is similar to that produced by otmethyl-para-tyrosine (table ii); p-ta is also elevated by apomorphine
(29) and the p-hpaa concentration is unchanged. thus p-ta synthesis
is stimulated by the increased availability of para-tyrosine due to th
inhibition, m-ta levels are unchanged. nevertheless m-hpaa concentrations are very low, suggesting that apomorphine is inhibiting the release
of m-ta possibly through a presynaptic mechanism. roos (31) described
the decreased hva concentrations found in the rat striatum after the
administration of apomorphine. this may suggest a reduced activity in
the dopaminergic neurons (32) or possibly that apomorphine stimulates
a presynaptic receptor which inhibits release (33). apomorphine may also
affect dopamine and m-ta synthesis by inhibiting striatal th either directly (34) or indirectly at the presynaptic level (33). the lack of effect
of apomorphine upon m-ta levels may well be due to the release inhibiting
properties of apomorphine causing the tissue level to be unchanged despite lack of synthesis.
 xxxg2276xxx  is the key enzyme controlling the synthesis of
the tyramines and thus of their acid metabolites,  xxxd3459xxx  availability
regulates the concentrations of p-hpaa and presumably the precursor
p-ta.  xxxg2276xxx  controls the availability ofpara-tyrosine and
may produce meta-tyrosine which is rapidly decarboxylated to form mta and subsequently m-hpaa. drugs which influence  xxxg2276xxx  activity (29) markedly affect the levels of the tyramines and their
acid metabolites m-hpaa and p-hpaa.
