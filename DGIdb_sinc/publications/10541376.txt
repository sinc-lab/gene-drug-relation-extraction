radioimmunotherapy of relapsed non-hodgkin's lymphoma with zevalin, a 90y-labeled anti-cd20 monoclonal antibody.  approximately 55,400 new cases of non-hodgkin's lymphoma (nhl) are diagnosed each year, with the overall prevalence of the disease now estimated to be 243,000. until recently, treatment alternatives for advanced disease included chemotherapy with or without external beam radiation. based on the results of several clinical trials, the chimeric monoclonal antibody rituximab has now been approved by the united states food and drug administration as a treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory, low-grade or follicular, b-cell nhl. several other monoclonal antibodies in conjugated and unconjugated forms have been evaluated in the treatment of nhl.  xxxd2312xxx , the murine counterpart to rituximab, radiolabeled with 90y (zevalin), is presently being evaluated in clinical trials. the success of radioimmunotherapy is dependent upon the appropriate choice of antibody, isotope, and chelator-linker. the  xxxd2312xxx  antibody targets the  xxxg1445xxx . the antibody is covalently bound to the chelator-linker tiuxetan (mx-dtpa), which tightly chelates the isotope 90y. to date, two phase i/ii zevalin clinical trials have been completed in patients with low-grade, intermediate-grade, and mantle cell nhl. the overall response rate was 64% in the first trial and 67% in the later trial. phase ii and iii trials are ongoing.
