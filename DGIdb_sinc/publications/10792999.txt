in our in vitro model of human cell carcinogenesis, normal human foreskin keratinocytes (hkc) transfected with human
papillomavirus type 16 dna (hkc/hpv16) progress toward malignancy through several phenotypically defined and reproducible “steps” that include immortalization, growth factor independence (hkc/gfi), differentiation resistance (hkc/dr), and
ultimately malignant conversion. while hkc/hpv16 are very sensitive to growth inhibition by  xxxd3417xxx  (ra) at
early passages, they lose their sensitivity to ra during progression in culture. however, gel mobility shift assays using the
retinoid response elements dr1 and  xxxg1057xxx  showed no changes in binding activity of nuclear extracts obtained from
hkc/hpv16 at different stages of in vitro progression. similarly, western blot analyses for  xxxd3417xxx  receptor ␥-1 and the
retinoid x receptors failed to reveal any decreases in the levels of these retinoid receptors throughout progression. in
addition, luciferase activity driven by the sv40 promoter with a  xxxg1057xxx  enhancer element was activated following ra treatment
of hkc/dr that were resistant to growth inhibition by ra. since ra induces transforming growth factor-␤2 (tgf-␤2) in normal
hkc and hkc/hpv16, we investigated whether this response changed during progression. again, ra induced tgf-␤2 mrna
in early and late passage hkc/hpv16, hkc/gfi, and hkc/dr approximately to the same extent, confirming that the ra
signaling pathways remained intact during in vitro progression despite the fact that the cells become resistant to growth
inhibition by ra. we then investigated the sensitivity of hkc/hpv16 to growth inhibition by tgf-␤. while early passage
hkc/hpv16 were as sensitive as normal hkc to growth inhibition by tgf-␤1 and tgf-␤2, the cells became increasingly
resistant to both tgf-␤ isotypes during in vitro progression. in addition, while both ra and tgf-␤ produced a decrease in
the levels of mrna for the hpv16 oncogenes e6 and e7 in early passage hkc/hpv16, this effect was also lost at later stages
of progression. finally, blocking anti-tgf-␤ antibodies partially prevented ra inhibition of growth and e6/e7 expression in
early passage hkc/hpv16. taken together, these data strongly suggest that inhibition of growth and hpv16 early gene
expression in hkc/hpv16 by ra is mediated by tgf-␤ and that a loss of ra sensitivity is linked to tgf-␤ resistance rather
than alterations in ra signaling. © 2000 academic press

gene or herpes simplex virus type 2 dna (dipaolo et al.,
1989, 1990). we have previously shown that hkc/hpv16
are initially more sensitive than normal hkc to growth
and differentiation control by  xxxd3417xxx  (ra),
an active metabolite of  xxxd3105xxx  (pirisi et al., 1992; khan
et al., 1993; creek et al., 1994). in addition, ra treatment
of hkc/hpv16 reduced steady-state levels of the hpv16
oncogenes e6 and e7 mrna and protein (pirisi et al.,
1992; khan et al., 1993; creek et al., 1994) and physiologic levels of ra (1 nm) inhibited hpv16-mediated immortalization of normal hkc by about 95% (khan et al.,
1993; creek et al., 1994). based on our previous finding
that ra treatment induces the synthesis and secretion of
the growth inhibitor transforming growth factor-␤ (tgf-␤)
(shipley et al., 1986; coffey et al., 1988) in normal hkc
and hkc/hpv16, we have formulated the hypothesis that
ra inhibition of growth is mediated by tgf-␤ (batova et
al., 1992). this concept is supported by the findings of
woodworth et al. (1990) that tgf-␤ inhibits e6 and e7

introduction
dna from the oncogenic human papillomaviruses
(hpvs), especially hpv types 16 and 18 (see pfister, 1996,

kaur and mcdougall, 1988; pirisi et al., 1987, 1988; woodworth et al., 1988, 1989), thus providing a powerful model
for studying the molecular mechanisms of cervical carcinogenesis. hkc/hpv16 first undergo premalignant progression in a series of phenotypically defined and reproducible “steps” in vitro, including growth factor independence (hkc/gfi) and differentiation resistance (hkc/dr)
(pirisi et al., 1988; zyzak et al., 1994). hkc/dr, but not
hkc/hpv16, are then susceptible to malignant conversion following transfection with either a viral ras onco-

transcription. therefore resistance to ra in hkc/hpv16
may be attributed to disruptions in either the ra or the
tgf-␤ signaling pathways.
retinoids, including ra, have shown promise in the
chemoprevention and treatment of various malignancies,
including cervical cancer (meyskens and manetta, 1995;
lippman et al., 1994; hong et al., 1995). cervical cancer,
the second most common cancer among women worldwide, is a progressive disease that is preceded by precancerous lesions of the cervix called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin). while most cin i will spontaneously regress, some lesions continue to progress
through cin ii, cin iii (carcinoma in situ), and ultimately
invasive cervical cancer. phase i and phase ii studies
with ra determined that ra applied topically to the cervix
can reverse or suppress cin (meyskens and manetta,
1995; meyskens et al., 1983; graham et al., 1986). for
example, a phase ii trial found that ra suppressed cin
in 50% of patients (graham et al., 1986). however, a more
recent randomized phase iii trial found that while topical
ra was effective in promoting regression in patients with
cin ii, it was not effective in patients with more advanced dysplasias (meyskens et al., 1994). this suggests
ra resistance as a feature of more advanced disease
and is consistent with the findings of retinoid resistance
in hpv16-immortalized endocervical cells (sarma et al.,
1996) or lung cancer (geradts et al., 1993; kim et al.,
1995).
retinoids exert their biological effects through ligandactivated nuclear receptors consisting primarily of heterodimers of ␣, ␤, or ␥ isotypes of the ra receptors
(rars) and the retinoid x receptors (rxrs) (mangelsdorf
et al., 1994). these nuclear receptor complexes bind to
enhancer elements located in the regulatory regions of
target genes, termed ra response elements (rares).
rares that bind rar/rxr heterodimers are usually composed of two direct repeat dna half-sites separated by a
2- or 5-bp spacer element (dr2 and  xxxg1057xxx , respectively).
retinoid receptors bound to these elements generally
enhance rates of transcription upon ligand binding. rxr
homodimers preferentially bind to dr1 elements in target genes. altered levels of nuclear retinoid receptors
have been well documented in a variety of tumors and
cancer cell lines, suggesting cell- or cancer-specific decreases in rar isotype expression as a common event
during tumorigenesis (geisen et al., 1997; geradts et al.,
1993; kim et al., 1995; monzon et al., 1997; widschwendter et al., 1997; xu et al., 1997a,b). a selective loss of
rar-␤ expression has been described in cervical carcinoma cells (bartsch et al., 1992), premalignant oral lesions (lotan et al., 1995), and non-small-cell lung cancer
(xu et al., 1997a) and has been directly linked to ra
resistance in human lung cancer cell lines (geradts et
al., 1993). the molecular basis for the loss of sensitivity
to ra treatment during later stages of cin is, however,
uncertain.

in the present study we have determined that the
growth inhibitory effects of ra treatment in hkc/hpv16 at
early stages of premalignant progression are directly
attributed to the increased production and secretion of
tgf-␤. in fact, anti-tgf-␤ antibodies counteract growth
inhibition by ra and ra inhibition of hpv16 gene expression in early passage, ra- and tgf-␤-sensitive cells.
however, hkc/hpv16 lose sensitivity to ra during in vitro
progression despite the presence of functional retinoid
receptors and intact ra signaling. retinoid refractoriness
is accompanied by a concurrent loss of sensitivity to the
growth inhibitory effects of tgf-␤. thus, these studies
directly link a loss of sensitivity to growth control by ra
to tgf-␤ resistance.

effect of ra on proliferation of hkc/hpv16 during in
vitro progression
to explore the effects of ra on hkc/hpv16 proliferation during in vitro progression, we used a clonal growth
assay coupled with computerized image analysis. representative dishes from a single clonal growth assay are
shown in fig. 1. the growth of normal hkc was stimulated 40 to 60% at low ra concentrations (1 and 10 nm)
but was inhibited about 50% at 1 ␮m ra. confirming
what we have reported previously (creek et al., 1994;
khan et al., 1993; pirisi et al., 1992), low-passage hkc/
hpv16 were much more sensitive than normal hkc to
inhibition of clonal growth by ra, showing marked
growth inhibition by 10 nm ra and almost complete
inhibition by 1 ␮m ra (fig. 1). in contrast, growth of
high-passage hkc/hpv16 was not inhibited by 10 nm ra
and was inhibited by only 20% at 1 ␮m ra (fig. 1). the
effects of ra on proliferation of hkc/hpv16 at different
stages of premalignant progression were also investigated using mass culture conditions. again, low-passage hkc/hpv16 (passages 16 to 25) were about sixfold
more sensitive to growth inhibition by ra than highpassage hkc/hpv16 (passages 146 to 180), hkc/gfi, or
hkc/dr (data not shown). taken together, these data
demonstrate that ra sensitivity of hkc/hpv16 dramatically decreases with continued passaging and is an
early event during in vitro progression.
rare binding activity is retained in ra-resistant
hkc/hpv16
loss of ra sensitivity in a variety of cancer cells has
been attributed to lost or reduced rar expression
(geisen et al., 1997; geradts et al., 1993; kim et al., 1995;
monzon et al., 1997; widschwendter et al., 1997; xu et al.,
1997a,b). therefore, we employed electrophoretic mobility shift assays to assess relative nuclear protein binding
activity to the dr1 and  xxxg1057xxx  rares in hkc/hpv16 at
various stages of progression. dr1 (fig. 2a) and  xxxg1057xxx

14), and high-passage hkc/hpv16d-1 (passage 174) were plated in cm at a density of 1000 cells per 60-mm tissue culture dish. the following day
the cells were refed with 8 ml of cm containing the indicated concentrations of ra in dmso. control dishes received dmso only (final dmso
concentration 1%). the cells were treated as above 6 days after plating and stained with giemsa solution 5 days later. a representative dish of three
dishes per experimental condition is shown.

(fig. 2b) binding activity was measured in nuclear extracts obtained from the hkc/hpv16d-4 line and its corresponding hkc/gfi and hkc/dr lines. except for a
modest decrease in hkc/dr, no significant change in
binding activity was observed during progression of
hkc/hpv16d-4 (figs. 2a and 2b, lanes 5–8). similarly, no

decrease in dr1 or  xxxg1057xxx  binding was demonstrated in
the hkc/hpv16d-1 line or its hkc/gfi and hkc/dr counterparts (data not shown). the specificity of the shifted
complex was demonstrated by competition with a 100fold excess of cold dr1 (fig. 2a, lane 4) or  xxxg1057xxx  probe
(fig. 2b, lane 3). as expected, mutations at both dna

were incubated with 32p-labeled dr1 (a) or  xxxg1057xxx  (b) oligonucleotide probes in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. endogenous binding activity of
hkc/hpv16d-4 nuclear extracts to the dr1 and  xxxg1057xxx  oligonucleotides was assessed during in vitro progression, from passage 22 (low) to passage
114 (high), to growth factor independent (gfi) to differentiation resistant (dr). the specific shifted complex in both panels is indicated by arrow 1 and
a nonspecific band is labeled ns. preincubation of the nuclear extracts for 20 min at room temperature with an isoform-specific rar␥-1 polyclonal
antibody produced a supershifted complex (arrow 2) with the  xxxg1057xxx  (b, lanes 9–13), but not the dr1 oligonucleotide (a, lanes 9–13).

fig. 3. in vitro progression of hkc/hpv16 is not associated with decreased rar or rxr protein levels. western blot analysis was performed using
an isoform-specific polyclonal antibody against rar␥-1, or an anti-rxr␣ polyclonal antibody that cross-reacts with all rxr isotypes, on nuclear
extracts from the hkc/hpv16d-4 and hkc/hpv16d-1 lines at low passage (low) and high passage (high) and from their corresponding growth
factor-independent (gfi) and differentiation-resistant (dr) cells. a similar amount of a total cell lysate from low-passage hkc/hpv16d-1 (lane 5) was
included to assess for enrichment of rxr and rar with nuclear isolation. rxr␣, a human rxr␣ ligand binding domain–gst fusion peptide (55 kda;
lane 1 of right panels); rar␥, a full-length human rar␥–gst fusion peptide (75 kda; lane 2 of right panels).

binding half-sites on the  xxxg1057xxx  probe (dr5mut) failed to
compete for binding to either labeled probe (figs. 2a and
2b, lanes 2). these results suggest that changes in dr1
or  xxxg1057xxx  binding activity are not consistently associated
with loss of ra sensitivity in these cells. anti-rar␥ antibodies, when added during the binding reaction,
caused a partial supershift of the  xxxg1057xxx - but not the dr1bound complex, suggesting that the dr1 element is
recognized primarily by rxr homodimers (figs. 2a and
2b, lanes 9–13). importantly, the levels of  xxxg1057xxx  supershifted complex did not change with in vitro progression
(fig. 2b, lanes 9–13), further supporting the finding that
ra resistance in hkc/hpv16 was not due to a loss of
rar expression. finally, preincubation of nuclear extracts from hkc/hpv16 at different stages of progression
with 0.1 nm to 1.0 ␮m  xxxd3417xxx  or 9-cisretinoic acid for 30 min prior to the binding reaction did
not affect the levels of protein binding to either the dr1
or the  xxxg1057xxx  probes (data not shown).
protein levels of rars are not decreased
in ra-resistant hkc/hpv16
the retinoid receptors rar␥ and rxr␣ are the predominant rars and rxrs expressed in skin (fisher et al.,
1994). therefore, western blot analysis was performed
using nuclear extracts obtained from hkc/hpv16d-1 and
d-4 to investigate whether decreased rar␥ or rxr protein levels paralleled the loss of ra sensitivity during in
vitro progression. we used either a polyclonal antibody
that reacts with all rxr isotypes (but not with rar␥) or an
isotype-specific anti-rar␥-1 polyclonal antibody. as
shown in fig. 3, rxr and rar␥-1 are clearly detectable
at all stages and do not decrease during in vitro progression. taken together, these results demonstrate that the
decreased sensitivity of high-passage hkc/hpv16, hkc/

gfi, and hkc/dr to ra is not due to reduced expression
or binding activities of the nuclear retinoid receptors
during in vitro progression.
ra induction of a ra-responsive  xxxg1057xxx  reporter
construct is maintained during in vitro
progression of hkc/hpv16
the electrophoretic mobility shift assays using dr1 and
 xxxg1057xxx  rares, as well as the western analyses for the nuclear rars and rxrs, suggested that reduced sensitivity to
growth control by ra during progression of hkc/hpv16
could not be ascribed to a loss of the nuclear retinoid
receptors. to more directly assess overall retinoid signaling
in hkc/hpv16, we employed a luciferase reporter construct
in which three copies of the  xxxg1057xxx  rare were used as an
enhancer element upstream of the sv40 promoter (dr53sv40-luc). the reporter was electroporated into hkc/
hpv16d-1 or d-4 at various stages of in vitro progression
and the ability of ra to induce luciferase expression was
then determined. as shown in fig. 4, ra induced luciferase
expression over 10-fold in low-passage hkc/hpv16. interestingly, not only did the ability of ra to induce luciferase
remain intact during progression, but the levels of induction
actually increased to 30- to 45-fold by the hkc/dr stage
(fig. 4). thus, ra signaling clearly remains intact during
progression despite the fact that the cells no longer respond to growth inhibition by ra.
ra induces tgf-␤2 expression in ra-resistant
hkc/hpv16
we have previously reported that ra treatment of normal hkc and hkc/hpv16 enhanced the secretion of
latent tgf-␤ and increased the steady-state levels of
tgf-␤1 and tgf-␤2 mrna by about 3- and up to 50-fold,

fig. 5. ra induction of tgf-␤2 mrna is not lost during in vitro
progression. rpas were conducted using riboprobes specific for either
tgf-␤2 or 28s rrna, with rna isolated from hkc/hpv16d-1 at low
(passage 13) and high passage (passage 157), and its corresponding
hkc/gfi (passage 223) and hkc/dr (passage 201) lines, each treated
for 72 h in the absence (⫺) or in the presence (⫹) of 100 nm ra.

hpv16d-4 (b) at each stage of premalignant conversion were electroporated with the luciferase reporter construct sv40-luc ( xxxg2041xxx -promoter),  xxxg1057xxx  3-sv40-luc, or  xxxg1057xxx  3mut-sv40-luc and were treated for 48 h
with 10 nm ra (in ethanol, 0.1% final concentration) or 0.1% ethanol, with
refeeding at 24 h. luciferase activity was then determined in cell
lysates. luciferase activity is expressed as the fold change above the
paired  xxxd102xxx treated control and represents the mean ⫾ sem of
three independent experiments.

respectively (batova et al., 1992). in view of the fact that
there appeared to be no loss of nuclear retinoid receptors or ra signaling capabilities during progression, we
wished to investigate whether ra could still induce
tgf-␤2 in cells resistant to ra-mediated growth inhibition. therefore, we performed rnase protection assays
with a riboprobe for tgf-␤2 using rna extracted from
low- and high-passage hkc/hpv16 and their corresponding hkc/gfi and hkc/dr lines. as shown in fig. 5,
ra promotes a marked increase in tgf-␤2 mrna at all
stages of progression. densitometric scanning of the
autogradiogram shown in fig. 5 found no significant
differences in the extent of induction (about 8-fold) of
tgf-␤2 mrna by ra during in vitro progression. thus,
the ra-mediated increase of tgf-␤2 remains intact in
hkc/hpv16, even when the cells are no longer sensitive
to growth inhibition by ra.
anti-tgf-␤ antibodies partially reverse ra inhibition
of cell proliferation in low-passage hkc/hpv16
the finding that ra induces tgf-␤ production has led
us to suggest that ra regulates proliferation of retinoid-

sensitive hkc/hpv16 by enhancing the production of
tgf-␤ that, after activation at the cell surface, could
inhibit cellular proliferation in an autocrine/paracrine
manner (batova et al., 1992). if this mechanism is correct,
then neutralizing anti-tgf-␤ antibodies added to the culture medium of ra-treated hkc/hpv16 should at least
partially reverse inhibition of dna synthesis by ra.
therefore, we examined the effect of anti-tgf-␤ antibodies that recognize and neutralize both tgf-␤1 and
tgf-␤2 on inhibition of [ 3h]thymidine uptake in lowpassage hkc/hpv16 treated with 100 nm ra. as shown
in fig. 6, ra alone inhibited [ 3h]thymidine uptake about
40%, while anti-tgf-␤ antibodies (2.5–20 ␮g/ml) partially
blocked ra inhibition of [ 3h]thymidine uptake in a dosedependent manner. at the highest concentration of antitgf-␤ antibody used (20 ␮g/ml), [ 3h]thymidine uptake
was 90% of that observed in the absence of ra and

following day the cells were refed with bpe-free cm containing either
0.1% dmso (u) or 100 nm ra (■) in dmso (final dmso concentration
0.1%), without any antibody (control), with nonspecific rabbit igg (igg),
or with the indicated concentrations of anti-tgf-␤ antibodies (1.25–20
␮g/ml). cells were refed in the same way at 48 and 72 h and then
pulsed with 1.0 ␮ci/ml [ 3h]thymidine for 16 h, and [ 3h]thymidine uptake
was determined as described under materials and methods. the data

they became increasingly tgf-␤ resistant (fig. 7). by the
hkc/dr stage of premalignant conversion, proliferation
was virtually unaffected by tgf-␤1 (fig. 7). treatment
with tgf-␤2 produced similar results: low-passage hkc/
hpv16 (passages 14 to 20) were highly sensitive, highpassage hkc/hpv16 (passages 187 to 190) progressively
lost sensitivity, and hkc/dr were completely resistant to
the growth inhibitory effects of tgf-␤2 (data not shown).

included for hkc/hpv16d-1 passages 7 to 26 represent the average of
six separate experiments conducted at passages 7, 14, 15, 17, 24, and

the average of two separate experiments conducted at passages 91
and 141. the data included for hkc/hpv16d-1 passages 187 to 190
represent the average of four separate experiments conducted at
passages 187, 188, 189, and 190. the data included for hkc/drd-1

anti-tgf-␤ antibody (fig. 6). control igg had no effect on
[ 3h]thymidine uptake in the absence or in the presence
of ra. anti-tgf-␤ antibodies alone (i.e., in the absence of
ra) consistently increased [ 3h]thymidine uptake about
30%, most likely by blocking the antiproliferative effects
of endogenous tgf-␤ secreted by the cells (fig. 6).
however, this effect was not dose-dependent, being
maximal at all anti-tgf-␤ antibody concentrations used
in these studies.

we have previously shown that ra treatment of lowpassage hkc/hpv16 causes a decrease in mrna and
protein levels of the hpv16 early orfs e6 and e7 (pirisi
et al., 1992; khan et al., 1993; creek et al., 1994) and
others found that tgf-␤ is a potent inhibitor of hpv16
early gene transcription (woodworth et al., 1990). rnase
protection analyses, using a riboprobe specific for
hpv16 e7, demonstrated that, unlike low-passage hkc/
hpv16, tgf-␤ treatment of high-passage hkc/hpv16
and hkc/dr no longer fully suppressed e7 mrna expression (fig. 8). similarly, ra treatment of high-passage
hkc/hpv16, hkc/gfi, and hkc/dr failed to reduce the
steady-state levels of e7 mrna (data not shown). overall, loss of sensitivity to ra parallels a loss of sensitivity
to tgf-␤-mediated inhibition of e7 expression. in addition, anti-tgf-␤ antibodies partially reversed the decrease of e7 mrna levels caused by ra treatment of
low-passage hkc/hpv16 (data not shown). these observations further support the interpretation that the effects
of ra on proliferation and hpv16 gene expression in
low-passage hkc/hpv16 are mediated through tgf-␤.
discussion
in this report we show a parallel loss of sensitivity to
ra and tgf-␤ as hkc/hpv16 progress in vitro toward the

loss of tgf-␤ responsiveness during in vitro
progression of hkc/hpv16
since hkc/hpv16 become increasingly resistant to the
growth inhibitory actions of ra during in vitro progression, and since growth inhibition by ra is mediated by
tgf-␤, we reasoned that hkc/hpv16 should also become correspondingly resistant to the growth inhibitory
effects of tgf-␤. thus, we compared the sensitivity of
normal hkc and increasing passages of hkc/hpv16
(from passages 7 to 190) and hkc/dr to either tgf-␤1 or
tgf-␤2 treatment. early passage hkc/hpv16 (passages
7 to 26) were very sensitive to the antiproliferative effects
of tgf-␤1 (fig. 7). by passage 40, hkc/hpv16 began to

conducted using probes for hpv16 e7 and for 28s rrna, as described
under materials and methods.

growth suppressive effects through tgf-␤, and directly
link ra resistance to tgf-␤ resistance. furthermore, we
demonstrate that retinoid refractoriness in hkc/hpv16
occurs despite the presence of functional retinoid receptors and intact ra signaling.
previous studies have provided strong evidence for a
loss of rars, especially rar-␤, in cancers of the lung (xu
et al., 1997a), cervix (geisen et al., 1997), and breast
(widschwendter et al., 1997; xu et al., 1997b), suggesting
loss of response to retinoids as an important event in the
transformation process. in addition, some of these studies have linked ra resistance to a loss of rar expression. we thus investigated in detail whether a loss in the
expression of the rars or rxrs or changes in retinoid
signaling accompanied resistance to ra-mediated inhibition of growth during in vitro progression of hkc/
hpv16. we obtained several lines of evidence that retinoid receptors are present and ra signaling remains
functional in late-stage, ra-resistant hkc/hpv16: (1) gel
shift assays with dr1 and  xxxg1057xxx  elements demonstrated
similar levels of retinoid receptor binding activity using
nuclear extracts prepared from retinoid-sensitive and
-resistant hkc/hpv16, (2) western blots showed comparable levels of rar␥ and rxr in ra-resistant and -sensitive cells, (3) a ra reporter construct was activated by
ra throughout progression, and (4) ra induction of
tgf-␤2 mrna is conserved in ra-resistant hkc/hpv16.
these results led us to conclude that altered expression
of, or signaling by, the predominant rar or rxr isotypes
found in skin are not the mechanism leading to retinoid
resistance in our in vitro model of hpv16-mediated transformation of hkc. similar to our findings, kim et al. (1995)
reported that retinoid refractoriness can occur during
lung carcinogenesis despite functional retinoid receptors. therefore, resistance to growth control by ra in
tumor cells may occur with or without a loss of nuclear
retinoid receptors.
since ra induces tgf-␤ synthesis and secretion in
both normal hkc and hkc/hpv16, we have previously
suggested that ra inhibition of growth in early passage
hkc/hpv16 may be mediated, at least in part, by tgf-␤
(batova et al., 1992). this mechanism is strongly supported by our current studies that demonstrate that antitgf-␤ antibodies partially prevent ra inhibition of cell
proliferation in hkc/hpv16 and by studies of glick et al.
(1989), who found that antibodies to tgf-␤2 could partially reverse ra-induced inhibition of dna synthesis in
mouse keratinocytes. if growth inhibition by ra is mediated by tgf-␤, one would predict that ra resistance
should be accompanied by tgf-␤ resistance. indeed we
found that in vitro progression of hkc/hpv16 is accompanied by a parallel resistance to both ra and tgf-␤.
overall, our results are in agreement with studies by
hietanen et al. (1998), who found that late passage hpvpositive cell lines derived from vaginal intraepithelial

403

neoplasias are less sensitive to the anti-proliferative effects of retinoids and tgf-␤ than early passage cells and
that neutralizing anti-tgf-␤ antibodies can block retinoid
inhibition of cell proliferation in early passage cells.
in summary, using an hpv16-initiated model of multistep carcinogenesis of human cells in vitro, we have
found that progression toward malignancy is associated
with an early and progressive loss of sensitivity to both
ra and tgf-␤. loss of sensitivity to ra was found to be
the direct result of a loss of sensitivity to tgf-␤. based
on these findings, we explored the molecular basis for
tgf-␤ resistance during in vitro progression of hkc/
hpv16. as shown in the accompanying paper, tgf-␤
resistance is accompanied by reduced expression of the
tgf-␤ receptor type i (mi et al., 2000), an essential
component of the tgf-␤ signal transduction pathway
(attisano et al., 1994; miyazono et al., 1994; wrana et al.,
1994). a partial loss of ra and tgf-␤ sensitivity in hkc/
hpv16 usually occurs prior to any detectable loss of
tgf-␤ receptor type i mrna. this observation suggests
that loss of tgf-␤ sensitivity during progression of
hpv16-immortalized cells may be the result of a rather
complex and multiple-component mechanism, with reduced tgf-␤ receptor type i expression being responsible for the complete tgf-␤ resistance observed at the
hkc/dr stage. e7 expression has been previously linked
to tgf-␤ resistance in hkc transformed by a plasmid
expressing hpv16 e6/e7 under the control of a human
␤-actin promoter (pietenpol et al., 1990). however, our
early passage hkc/hpv16, which express enough e7 to
support continuous growth, are as sensitive as normal
hkc to growth inhibition by tgf-␤. similarly, braun et al.
(1990) reported that nontumorigenic hpv16-immortalized
human epithelial cells were sensitive to tgf-␤, whereas
two cervical carcinoma cell lines (caski and siha) were
resistant. there are several possible reasons for this
apparent paradox between our current studies and those
of pietenpol et al. (1990). first, the hpv16-immortalized
cells used by pietenpol et al. (1990) had been selected in
high-calcium and serum-containing medium, and one
could argue that they have the same phenotype as our
late stage premalignant hkc/dr cells. second, hkc/
hpv16 used in the present studies were immortalized by
the full-length hpv16 dna, and e7 is expressed under
the control of the hpv16 upstream regulatory region,
which is extremely sensitive to inhibition by tgf-␤
(woodworth et al., 1990). in contrast, pietenpol et al.
(1990) used a human ␤-actin promoter to drive e6/e7
expression. it is possible that in early passage hkc/
hpv16, in which tgf-␤ signaling mechanisms are intact,
tgf-␤ treatment reduces dramatically e7 expression
and therefore is growth inhibitory because e7 expression is required to maintain continuous growth. however,
as the cells progress, tgf-␤ signaling is compromised
and all mechanisms of growth inhibition by tgf-␤ (including inhibition of e6/e7 expression) are lost or greatly

404

borger et al.

diminished. it will be of extreme interest to explore further the possible connections between the expression of
e6 and e7 and tgf-␤ resistance, including the loss of
tgf-␤ receptor type i, in our model of hpv16-mediated
transformation of hkc.
materials and methods
materials. ra was from eastman kodak co. or sigma
chemical co. [ 3h]thymidine (sp act 65 ci/mmol) was
purchased from icn. a rabbit anti-porcine platelet
tgf-␤1 antibody (purified igg) was from r&d systems.
this antibody cross-reacts and neutralizes both human
tgf-␤1 and tgf-␤2. porcine tgf-␤1 and tgf-␤2 were
also obtained from r&d systems.
cell culture and cell lines. normal hkc were isolated
from newborn foreskins as described previously, except
the epidermis was separated from the dermis by incubation overnight at 4°c in 0.25% trypsin (gibco brl)
instead of collagenase (pirisi et al., 1987, 1988, 1992).
isolation and characterization of the immortalized hkc/
hpv16 lines have been described in detail in previous
publications (creek et al., 1994; khan et al., 1993; pirisi et
al., 1987, 1988, 1992; zyzak et al., 1994). these cell lines
were obtained by transfecting normal hkc strains, each
derived from a different individual, with the plasmid
pmhpv16d; a head-to-tail dimer of the full-length hpv16
dna cloned into the bamh1 site of the vector pdmmtneo, which carries a gene for resistance to the antibiotic
 xxxg418xxx  (pirisi et al., 1987, 1988). the different immortalized
lines were selected with  xxxg418xxx  and were designated
hkc/hpv16d-1 to d-5.
growth factor-independent hkc lines were established by maintenance of the various hkc/hpv16 lines in
complete medium (see below for medium composition)
lacking bovine pituitary extract (bpe) and epidermal
growth factor (egf). the establishment and growth characteristics of the hkc/gfi lines have been described
previously (pirisi et al., 1988; zyzak et al., 1994). differentiation-resistant hkc/hpv16 were selected from hkc/
hpv16 by maintenance in medium containing 5% fetal
bovine serum and 1 mm calcium chloride (pirisi et al.,
1988; zyzak et al., 1994).
normal hkc and hkc/hpv16 were cultured in serumfree mcdb153-lb medium, supplemented with hydrocortisone (0.2 ␮m), insulin (5 ␮g/ml), transferrin (10 ␮g/ml),
triiodothyronine (10 nm),  xxxg2125xxx  2 (0.1 mm), egf (5 ng/ml),
and bpe (35–50 ␮g protein/ml) with medium changes
every 48 h (pirisi et al., 1987, 1988; zyzak et al., 1994). this
medium will be referred to as complete mcdb153-lb
medium (cm). hkc/gfi were maintained in cm without
egf and bpe, which will be referred to as growth factordepleted medium (gfdm). hkc/dr were cultured in cm
containing 5% fetal bovine serum (fbs) and 1 mm calcium chloride. media were changed every 48 h. cells

were routinely split 1:10 so that each passage represents
three to four population doublings.
clonal growth assay. normal hkc and different passage hkc/hpv16d-1 were plated at low density (1000
cells/60-mm culture dish) in cm. cells were fed 1 and 6
days after plating with 8 ml/dish of cm containing various concentrations of ra. ra was added to the medium
in  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso) and the controls contained
dmso only. the final dmso concentration was 0.1%.
colonies were fixed in methanol and stained with giemsa solution 11 days after plating. the total area of the
colonies, relative to the area of the dish, was determined
by computerized image analysis.
mass culture growth assay. hkc/hpv16d-1 at different
passages and its hkc/gfi and hkc/dr derivatives were
plated at a density of 20,000 cells/35-mm culture dish in
their respective media and refed 24 h after plating in
media containing dmso only (0.1%) or ra (25–500 nm) in
dmso. cell number was determined in triplicate dishes
for each ra concentration 6 days after plating, and every
other day up to about 2 weeks in culture, by trypsinizing
and counting cells in a hemocytometer.
[ 3h]thymidine uptake assay. normal hkc and different
passage hkc/hpv16d-1 or hkc/dr were plated (50,000
cells/well) into 24-well clusters (costar) in their respective media. at 24 h after plating, the cells were refed with
cm (1 ml) containing the indicated concentrations of
tgf-␤1 or tgf-␤2, and 24 h later the cells were pulsed
for 16 h with [ 3h]thymidine (0.5 ␮ci/well). the cells were
then washed three times with 1 ml of cm, followed by
two washes with 1 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic
acid. the cells were solubilized in 0.5 ml of 1 n sodium
hydroxide containing 0.1%  xxxd3215xxx .
[ 3h]thymidine present in 0.4 ml of each sample was
determined in 5 ml of a water-compatible scintillation
cocktail containing 0.4 ml of 1 n hcl. for experiments
with ra and anti-tgf-␤ antibodies, the same procedures
were followed with the modifications described in the
figure legends.
rna analysis. the levels of mrna for tgf-␤2 and
hpv16 e7 were measured by rnase protection assays
(rpas) using an rpaii kit (ambion) according to the
instructions provided by the manufacturer. a hpv16 e7specific riboprobe was synthesized on the template of a
fragment of the hpv16 e7 orf (nucleotides 653–846),
cloned into the plasmid pcrii (invitrogen). the template
for the synthesis of a riboprobe specific for tgf-␤2
(nucleotides 1204–1365) (madisen et al., 1988) was produced by pcr and cloned into pgem-t easy (promega).
molecular size standards and housekeeping control templates for the rpas were obtained from ambion.
preparation of nuclear extracts. nuclear extracts were
prepared using modifications of the methods of dignam
et al. (1983) and fisher et al. (1994) and all procedures
were performed at 4°c. hkc/hpv16 cultures were
washed twice with ice-cold dulbecco’s phosphate-buff-

 xxxd3417xxx  and tgf-␤ resistance in hpv16-transformed keratinocytes

ered saline (pbs) and then scraped into pbs containing
1 mm edta using a cell lifter, pelleted by low-speed
centrifugation for 5 min at 200 g, and resuspended in
hypotonic buffer (10 mm hepes, ph 7.9 at 4°c, 10 mm
kcl, 1.5 mm mgcl 2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (dtt), 0.2 mm
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pmsf), 1 ␮g/ml leupeptin,
and 1 ␮g/ml pepstatin a) at a concentration of 2 ⫻ 10 7
cells/ml. the cell pellet obtained through a subsequent
low-speed centrifugation was immediately resuspended
in hypotonic buffer as described above, incubated for 10
min on ice, and then lysed by 10 strokes of a dounce b
homogenizer. release of intact nuclei from ⬎95% of the
cells was confirmed through microscopic inspection. nuclei in the homogenate were collected by centrifugation
for 10 min at 1500 g. the resulting crude nuclear pellet
was resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mm hepes, ph
7.9 at 4°c, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 500 mm kcl, 1.5 mm mgcl 2,
0.2 mm edta, ph 8.0, 0.5 mm dtt, 0.2 mm pmsf, 1
␮g/ml leupeptin, and 1 ␮g/ml pepstatin a) in a volume
equivalent to 3 ml per 10 9 cells. extraction of nuclear
protein was performed for 30 min at 4°c with gentle
mixing and the extracted nuclei were subsequently removed by a 30-min centrifugation at 16,000 g. the resulting supernatant was dialyzed in a slide-a-lyzer cassette
(10-kda cut-off; pierce) against 400 vol of dialysis buffer
(20 mm hepes, ph 7.9 at 4°c, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm
kcl, 0.2 mm edta, ph 8.0, 0.5 mm dtt, and 0.2 mm
pmsf) for 45 min. precipitates were removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 16,000 g and small aliquots of the
soluble nuclear extracts were immediately frozen and
stored at ⫺80°c for subsequent use in gel shift assays
and western blot analyses. protein concentrations were
determined using the dc protein assay kit (bio-rad)
using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a standard.
electrophoretic mobility shift assays (emsa). emsa
were performed essentially according to the methods of
rochette-egly et al. (1991) with slight modifications. double-stranded oligonucleotide probes containing the wildtype  xxxg1057xxx  retinoid response element in the promoter
region of the  xxxd3417xxx  receptor ␤-2 (rar␤-2) gene, as
described by mader et al. (1993), and a dr1 retinoid
response element (5⬘-gtagggttcagagttcactcgc3⬘) were 5⬘-end-labeled with t4 polynucleotide kinase
(promega) in the presence of [␥- 32p]atp. a dr5mut double-stranded oligonucleotide containing mutations at
both dna binding motifs (5⬘-gtaggcttacccgaattttcactcgc-3⬘) was used as a cold nonspecific probe in
competition of binding. nuclear extracts (10 ␮g protein)
were preincubated at room temperature for 20 min in a
20-␮l binding reaction mix containing 20 mm tris–hcl,
ph 7.5, 100 mm kcl, 1 mm mgcl 2, 0.1 mm edta, ph 8.0,
0.5 mm dtt, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 ␮g poly(di–dc), 1 ␮g
sonicated herring sperm dna, and cold competitor oligonucleotides when required. for antibody supershifts, 2
␮l of isoform-specific ra receptor ␥-1 (rar␥-1) rabbit
polyclonal antibody (affinity bioreagents) was also in-

405

cluded during this preincubation period. the 32p-endlabeled probe (20 fmol) was subsequently added and the
samples were incubated at room temperature for an
additional 15 min. resulting protein:dna complexes
were resolved by nondenaturing electrophoresis through
a 5% polyacrylamide, 0.13% bisacrylamide gel in 1⫻
tris–borate/edta buffer for 2.5 h at 150 v and 20°c. the
gels were dried and the radiolabeled complexes were
visualized by autoradiography.
western blot analysis. equal amounts of nuclear extract (20–30 ␮g protein) were resolved on a 12% sds–
polyacrylamide gel in a miniunit/tris–glycine buffer system (25 mm tris, 192 mm glycine, and 0.1% sds). proteins were transferred onto trans-blot nitrocellulose
(bio-rad; 0.2 ␮m) by electroblotting for 3.5 h (120 v) at
4°c in 25 mm tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol.
air-dried membranes were rinsed briefly in several
changes of pbs and blocked overnight at 4°c in blocking
solution containing 5% carnation skim milk powder and
0.05% tween 20 (sigma) in pbs. a polyclonal rabbit
anti-retinoid x receptor antibody (anti-rxr-␣) (santa cruz
biotechnology) that cross-reacts with all rxr isotypes or
an isoform-specific anti-rar␥-1 was diluted 1:1000 in
fresh blocking solution and incubated with the blot for 1 h
at room temperature with gentle rocking. following extensive washings in pbs containing 0.05% tween 20,
blots were subsequently incubated with a 1:5000 dilution
of goat anti-rabbit biotin-conjugated secondary antibody
(sigma) in fresh blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. after being washed as described above, blots
were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a
1:1000 dilution of streptavidin–horseradish peroxidase
conjugate (amersham) in western blocking reagent
(boehringer manneheim) diluted to 1⫻ with pbs containing 0.05% tween 20. a final series of washes was followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection using
supersignal (pierce). membranes were exposed to
x-omat ar film (eastman kodak) for 5–10 s and autoradiograms were quantified densitometrically. a rxr␣ ligand binding domain– xxxg1073xxx  (gst)
fusion peptide (55 kda; 10 ng) and a full-length rar␥–
gst fusion peptide (75 kda; 10 ng) (santa cruz biotechnology) were used to demonstrate the specificity of the
immunoreaction. parallel gels stained with coomassie
brilliant blue r-250 were used to confirm relative protein
loading, and reprobing of the blots (stripped for 30 min at
60°c in 2% sds, 62.5 mm tris–cl, ph 6.8, and 100 mm
␤- xxxd26xxx ) with a rabbit anti-actin primary antibody (sigma) was used to demonstrate a similar degree
of nuclear protein purification.
electroporation and luciferase reporter activity. synthetic oligonucleotides of head-to-tail trimers of the  xxxg1057xxx 
or dr5mut gel shift probe sequence (see above) were
cloned into the ecorv site of pbluescript sk(⫹) (stratagene), restriction digested with bamhi and kpni, and
then subcloned into the compatible kpni and bglii sites

of  xxxg2041xxx -promoter (promega) to serve as an enhancer
element upstream of the sv40 promoter in the luciferase
reporter. the constructs are referred to as  xxxg1057xxx  3-sv40luc or dr5mut 3-sv40-luc. approximately 1.2 ⫻ 10 7 cells
per sample were electroporated with 10 ␮g plasmid
dna. to produce paired samples with identical electroporation efficiencies, two electroporation samples were
combined and then were equally plated between 2⫻
100-mm dishes.  xxxd1891xxx .5 h postplating, the paired samples
were treated for 48 h with either 10 nm ra in ethanol
(0.1% final concentration) or 0.1% ethanol with refeeding
at 24 h. hkc/hpv16 and hkc/dr were treated in cm and
hkc/gfi were treated in gfdm. following treatment,
cells were lysed by sonication and luciferase activity was
determined using the luciferase assay system (promega). luciferase activity is expressed as the fold
change relative to the paired ethanol control group.
