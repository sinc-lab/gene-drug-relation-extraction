salivary glands. in this study, activation of erks, members of the
mitogen-activated protein kinase family, by  xxxd2401xxx  was examined in a human salivary gland cell line (hsy). immunoblot analysis
indicated that  xxxd2401xxx  (10⫺5 m) induced transient activation of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 (4.4-fold relative to basal  xxxd1891xxx  min) similar to that caused by
egf (6.7 fold).  xxxd2401xxx , like egf, also induced phosphorylation
of the egf receptor. however, inhibition of egf receptor phosphorylation by the tyrphostin ag-1478 only partially attenuated  xxxd2401xxx -induced erk phosphorylation, whereas egf-responsive erk
activation was completely blocked. the gi inhibitor pertussis toxin
also caused partial inhibition of  xxxd2401xxx -stimulated erk activation. the camp analog 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3⬘,5⬘-cyclic
monophosphate (cpt-camp) and the camp-elevating agents  xxxd2388xxx 
and cholera toxin produced transient  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation, similar to the
effect of  xxxd2401xxx , in hsy cells. the stimulatory effects of
 xxxd2401xxx  and camp on erk phosphorylation were not reduced
by the pka inhibitor  xxxd477xxx , whereas the src family inhibitor 4-amino5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidase ( xxxd1307xxx ) and
transfection of a dominant-negative src construct diminished  xxxd2401xxx -induced erk activation.  xxxd2401xxx  induced marked overexpression of the cell growth-related adhesion molecule cd44, and
this effect of  xxxd2401xxx  was abolished by the erk pathway
inhibitor  xxxd1169xxx . in summary, we show a dual mechanism of
 xxxd2401xxx -induced erk phosphorylation in hsy cells— one pathway mediated by egf receptor transactivation and the other by an
egf receptor-independent pathway possibly mediated by camp. our
results also suggest that  xxxd2401xxx -induced growth of salivary
tissue may involve erk-mediated cd44 expression.

ergic signaling, activation of the receptor causes the exchange
of gtp for gdp on the ␣-subunit of g␣␤␥, leading to the
dissociation of the ␣-subunit from the ␤␥-subunits. ␤-adrenergic receptors act through g␣s to stimulate adenylyl cyclase,
resulting in camp production and activation of the campdependent protein kinase, or pka, cascade. ␤-adrenergic
receptors may also be coupled to g␣i, which classically inhibits
adenylyl cyclase. recent studies have demonstrated that activation of ␤-adrenergic receptors and other gpcrs also stimulates mapk cascades that mediate cell proliferation and/or
cell differentiation (13, 19).
mapk pathways constitute an evolutionarily conserved series of serine/threonine kinases traditionally linked to receptor
tyrosine kinases such as receptors for egf and pdgf. the
erks are one class of mapks that are regulated by a threetiered cascade composed of a mapk kinase kinase (mapkkk;
e.g., c-raf1 or b-raf), a mapk kinase (e.g.,  xxxg1361xxx  and
 xxxg1362xxx ) and a mapk (e.g.,  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx ) (23). in the past
several years, it has been demonstrated that numerous gpcrstimulated cellular functions are mediated through the mapk
cascades. in a number of systems, ␤-adrenergic receptorinduced activation of erks proceeds through pka-, g␣i-, and
g␤␥-mediated signaling events and may be attributable to the
transactivation of the egf receptor (19). transactivation of
receptor tyrosine kinases after gpcr stimulation has been
documented for egf, pdgf, and insulin-like growth factor
receptors and is the subject of several recent reviews (7, 13,
22). however, the mechanisms by which ␤-adrenergic receptors and other gpcrs activate the erk/mapk cascade are
cell type-, ligand-, and g protein-specific and may be dependent on the physiological conditions of the cell (18).
in salivary gland tissues, activation of ␤-adrenergic receptors plays an important role in protein secretion, secretory
protein expression, and postnatal development and growth (2).
chronic treatment of rodents with the ␤-adrenergic receptor
agonist  xxxd2401xxx  has long been known to cause salivary
gland enlargement without the development of neoplasm (4,
28). there is some evidence suggesting that mapks are
activated during  xxxd2401xxx  treatment. one study showed
that ras guanine nucleotide exchange activity, which triggers
the mapkkk-mek-mapk cascade, was increased in parotid
cell homogenates from  xxxd2401xxx -treated rats compared
with untreated rats (31). the same group of investigators
reported that in parotid gland lysates from  xxxd2401xxx -treated
the costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment
of page charges. the article must therefore be hereby marked “advertisement”
in accordance with 18 u.s.c. section 1734 solely to indicate this fact.

␤-adrenergic-induced erk activation in salivary cells

c1358

rats, levels of phosphorylated  xxxg1366xxx  increased for up to 12 h of
treatment, whereas phosphorylated  xxxg1369xxx  levels decreased
gradually over time; the activation of erks by  xxxd2401xxx 
was apparently not affected by camp accumulation or pka
activity (5). other studies suggested that egf receptor
signaling cascades may be involved in mediating  xxxd2401xxx  effects on the salivary gland in rodents (14, 26).
despite these earlier studies, the involvement of erk signaling pathway(s) and downstream targets as mediators of
salivary cell responses to ␤-adrenergic receptor activation
has yet to be defined clearly. among potential targets downstream of erk signaling in salivary cells is cd44, an adhesion
molecule thought to regulate salivary gland growth and development (8, 24).
in the present study we examined the cellular signals linking
␤-adrenergic receptors with the activation of erks in a human
salivary cell line (hsy). our results suggest that  xxxd2401xxx 
activates erks via two different signaling pathways: on the
one hand, activation of erks is induced by transactivation of
the egf receptor, whereas an additional activation pathway
possibly mediated by camp signaling appears to be at least
partly independent of receptor  xxxg2198xxx . furthermore,
we have identified cd44 as a possible downstream effector of
␤-adrenergic receptor-induced erk activation in salivary
gland cells.

 xxxd2401xxx  stimulates the activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 ( xxxd1355xxx /
 xxxg1366xxx ) in hsy cells. to determine whether  xxxd2401xxx 
can induce the activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 in hsy cells, we measured the effect of  xxxd2401xxx  on the phosphorylation of
 xxxd1355xxx / xxxg1366xxx  with immunoblot analysis. because we previously showed (34, 35) that egf induces erk signaling in
hsy cells, egf was used as a positive control in these
experiments.  xxxd2401xxx , like egf, induced the phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 without affecting total  xxxg1369xxx /2 protein levels. both  xxxd2401xxx  and egf induced a transient activation
of  xxxg1369xxx /2. the activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 by  xxxd2401xxx  peaked
at 5–15 min (fig. 1a), with a return to basal level after 1–2 h.
a similar time course of  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation was observed in
egf-treated cells (fig. 1a).  xxxd1891xxx  min,  xxxd2401xxx  increased
phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 4.4 ⫾ 0.8-fold (mean ⫾ se; n ⫽
9) relative to basal levels, whereas egf activated erk phosphorylation 6.7 ⫾ 2.2-fold (n ⫽ 5; p ⬎ 0.05 compared with
 xxxd2401xxx  stimulation) (fig. 1b).
 xxxd2401xxx -induced erk activation is mediated partially
by egf receptor transactivation. activation of erks by
gpcrs in several cell types was previously shown to occur via
transactivation of the egf receptor (13, 19). in the present
study of hsy cells,  xxxd2401xxx  induced egf receptor phosphorylation comparable to that induced by egf (fig. 2). to
examine the role of the egf receptor in  xxxd2401xxx -induced
erk activation, we pretreated hsy cells with the egf receptor inhibitor ag-1478 for 30 min before stimulation with
 xxxd2401xxx  or egf. activation of the egf receptor was
detected by increased phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue
y1068 with a phosphorylation-specific antibody (fig. 2b).
ag-1478 completely inhibited the phosphorylation of the egf
receptor at y1068 induced by both  xxxd2401xxx  and egf.
however, ag-1478 eliminated egf-stimulated erk phosphorylation but had only a partial inhibitory effect on  xxxd2401xxx -induced erk activation, indicating the presence of
an alternate pathway for  xxxd2401xxx  stimulation of erks
(fig. 2b).
previous studies have indicated that the g␣i subunit may
mediate gpcr stimulation of erks via transactivation of the
egf receptor (16, 18). we examined the involvement of g␣i in
 xxxd2401xxx -induced erk activation by treating hsy cells
with the g␣i inhibitor pertussis toxin for 16 h before stimulation with  xxxd2401xxx . like the egf receptor inhibitor ag1478 (see above), pertussis toxin caused partial inhibition of
 xxxd2401xxx -stimulated  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation (fig. 3). although this finding suggests a role for g␣i in erk activation by
 xxxd2401xxx , a portion of the ␤-adrenergic response in hsy
cells appears to involve stimulatory signals other than the
gi-dependent pathway of egf receptor transactivation described in some other tissues.

 xxxd2401xxx -induced  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation may also be mediated by camp signaling. stimulation of ␤-adrenergic receptors by  xxxd2401xxx  results in g␣s-mediated activation of
adenylyl cyclase and increased production of camp. we
previously demonstrated (34) the activation of adenylyl cyclase
activity by  xxxd2401xxx  in hsy cells. to investigate whether
activation of camp signaling stimulates erks in hsy cells,
we tested the effects of the membrane-permeant camp analog
cpt-camp and camp-elevating agents on phosphorylation of
 xxxg1369xxx /2. treatment of hsy cells with cpt-camp resulted in
erk activation with a time course similar to that observed in
 xxxd2401xxx -treated cells, i.e., erk phosphorylation induced
by cpt-camp treatment peaked at 5–15 min and returned to
basal level within 1 h (fig. 4a). interestingly, activation of
erks by cpt-camp was observed even after pretreatment of
cells with ag-1478 (5 ⫻ 10⫺6 m; data not shown); in this
respect, camp, like  xxxd2401xxx  (fig. 2b), appears to stimulate erk phosphorylation via signaling intermediate(s) at least
partially distinct from the egf receptor.
cholera toxin activates adenylyl cyclase by catalyzing adpribosylation of the stimulatory g␣s protein. our previous studies (34) demonstrated that cholera toxin causes substantial
activation of adenylyl cyclase in hsy cells. in the present
study hsy cells were preincubated with cholera toxin, followed by measurement of erk activation with or without
 xxxd2401xxx . phosphorylation of erks was increased by
incubation with cholera toxin for 30 min but returned to basal
level by 2 h and also at 24 h with toxin treatment. erks were
further activated by  xxxd2401xxx  after 30-min but not 2- and
24-h pretreatment with cholera toxin (fig. 4b, left). because

adenylyl cyclase of hsy cells remains activated after 2-h
treatment with cholera toxin (34), the reduction in erk activation at 2 h of toxin treatment most likely reflects the transient
stimulatory effect of camp on phosphorylation of erks (fig.
4a). in a number of cell types, g␣s is either redistributed to
cytosol or downregulated after prolonged activation by cholera
toxin (5, 21, 29). thus, in our experiments, the failure to
observe stimulation of erks by  xxxd2401xxx  after 24 h of
cholera toxin exposure may at least partly reflect loss of g␣s
coupled to ␤-adrenergic receptors in the plasma membrane. in
contrast, prolonged (24 h) treatment with cholera toxin had no
apparent effect on egf-induced activation of erks (fig. 4b,
right). the results of these studies suggest that g␣s plays a
critical role in  xxxd2401xxx -induced activation of erks.
pka is thought to be involved in ␤-adrenergic receptormediated activation of erks in a variety of cell types (19).
however, in hsy cells, the stimulatory effects of  xxxd2401xxx  and cholera toxin on phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2
were not affected by pretreatment (2 h) with the pka
inhibitor  xxxd477xxx  (5 ⫻ 10⫺6 m; fig. 5). likewise, prevention
ajp-cell physiol • vol

of camp degradation with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor
 xxxd2388xxx  also increased erk phosphorylation, whereas the
stimulatory effect of  xxxd2388xxx  was not influenced by pretreatment with  xxxd477xxx  (fig. 5). activation of erks by campelevating agents was not reduced by increasing concentrations
of  xxxd477xxx  up to 2.5 ⫻ 10⫺5 m (data not shown). on the basis of
these results, activation of pka has no apparent role in mediating ␤-adrenergic receptor-, g␣s-, or camp-responsive erk
activation in hsy cells.
 xxxd2401xxx -induced erk activation is src dependent. activation of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases of the src
family may be involved in gpcr-induced activation of
erks by both egf receptor transactivation and campdependent pathways (19). to determine whether src mediates  xxxd2401xxx -induced activation of erks in hsy cells,
we measured  xxxd2401xxx  responsiveness in cells pretreated for 2 h with  xxxd1307xxx  (5 ⫻ 10⫺6 m), a src familyselective  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor. incubation with  xxxd1307xxx

␤-adrenergic-induced erk activation in salivary cells

an inactive  xxxd1307xxx  analog, had no effect on erk activation by
 xxxd2401xxx  (fig. 6a). because  xxxd1307xxx  is known to inhibit all src
family kinases, we also used a dnsrc to inhibit src specifically.
the phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 induced by  xxxd2401xxx  was
inhibited in dnsrc-transfected hsy cells (fig. 6b). these
results indicate that in hsy cells, src plays a regulatory role in
 xxxd2401xxx -induced erk activation. basal phosphorylation
of  xxxg1369xxx /2 appeared to be increased in dnsrc-transfected cells;
whether phosphorylation of nonmutated sites in the dnsrc
construct might result in increased basal erk activities is
unknown (25).
 xxxd2401xxx  increases expression of cd44 via erk activation. the cell adhesion molecule cd44 may play a role in
regulating growth and differentiation of several tissues, including the salivary gland (8, 24). in addition, cd44 expression in
some tissues appears to be erk dependent (32). in the present
study, flow cytometric analysis revealed that  xxxd2401xxx 
treatment of hsy cells produced a marked elevation in surface
cd44 expression. expression of surface cd44 was also increased by treatment of cells with either egf or  xxxd2388xxx . the
increase in cd44 expression induced by  xxxd2401xxx  and
egf was eliminated by the erk pathway inhibitor  xxxd1169xxx ,
which also blocked  xxxd2401xxx  stimulation of erk phosajp-cell physiol • vol

phorylation. interestingly, the egf receptor inhibitor ag-1478
also blocked the cd44 response to  xxxd2401xxx  (fig. 7).
together, these results implicate cd44 as a downstream effector of  xxxd2401xxx -induced erk activation in hsy cells. the
findings are also generally consistent with a role for both
camp- and egf receptor-dependent signaling in the cd44
response to  xxxd2401xxx .
discussion

a major goal of current salivary gland research is to develop
strategies to maintain or regenerate functional salivary tissue
after glandular destruction by disease processes, e.g., sjögren
syndrome, or therapeutic maneuvers such as head and neck
irradiation. chronic treatment of rats with  xxxd2401xxx  is
known to induce salivary gland enlargement, suggesting that
salivary epithelial cell proliferation is regulated by ␤-adrenergic receptor-mediated signaling. using the hsy human salivary epithelial cell line, we have demonstrated in this study
that  xxxd2401xxx  induces activation/phosphorylation of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 through two distinct pathways, one involving the
transactivation of the egf receptor and the other possibly
dependent on camp-generated signals.

␤-adrenergic-induced erk activation in salivary cells

 xxxd1867xxx 

fig. 6. effect of src inhibition on iso-induced activation of erks. a: hsy cells were incubated with or without 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(tbutyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine ( xxxd1307xxx , 5 ⫻ 10⫺6 m; left) or 4-amino-7-phenylpyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (pp3, 5 ⫻ 10⫺6 m; right) for 2 h, followed by addition
of iso (10⫺5 m) or vehicle for 10 min. representative western blots of phosphorylated and total  xxxg1369xxx /2 and egfr are shown. middle: mean ⫾ se values from
3 experiments. b: hsy cells were transiently transfected with a dominant-negative src (dnsrc) plasmid or empty vector, using lipofectamine plus reagent
as described in materials and methods. transfected cells were selected, cultured, and then incubated in the presence or absence of  xxxd2401xxx  (10⫺5 m) for
10 min. western blot analysis of cell lysates for phosphorylated and total  xxxd1355xxx / xxxg1366xxx  is shown on left. values on right are averages (⫾range) from 2 experiments.

activation of mapks by gpcrs such as ␤-adrenergic
receptors has been demonstrated to be mediated by the transactivation of egf receptors in other cell types, e.g., cardiac
fibroblasts and cos-7 cells (12, 15, 20). our results show that
 xxxd2401xxx  activates  xxxg1369xxx /2 in hsy cells by a signal
transduction mechanism involving the transactivation of egf
receptors.  xxxd2401xxx  treatment was found to induce phosphorylation of the egf receptor at y1068, a major site for
receptor autophosphorylation. furthermore, blockade of egf
receptor phosphorylation with the specific inhibitor ag-1478
diminished  xxxd2401xxx -induced activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 (fig.
2). together, these data demonstrate interreceptor signaling
“cross-talk” between ␤-adrenergic and egf receptors in hsy
cells.
in this study we performed experiments to elucidate the
molecular mechanism by which  xxxd2401xxx  induces egf
receptor transactivation in hsy cells. previous work suggests
that in a number of tissues, ␤-adrenergic receptor-induced
activation of erks is sensitive to the g␣i inhibitor pertussis
toxin. in these systems gi-dependent erk activation appears
to be mediated through the g␤␥ subunit and may involve egf
receptor transactivation (16, 18). moreover, gi-dependent activation of erks by the ␤-adrenergic receptor is thought to
result from a pka-induced phosphorylation of the receptor,
ajp-cell physiol • vol

which causes a “switch” in the coupling of the receptor from gs
to gi (18). we found that pretreatment of hsy cells with
pertussis toxin attenuated  xxxd2401xxx -induced erk activation (fig. 3); in preliminary work  xxxd2401xxx -responsive
phosphorylation of the egf receptor was also reduced by
pertussis toxin (data not shown). short-term activation of g␣s
with cholera toxin was observed to increase phosphorylation of
 xxxg1369xxx /2, whereas long-term toxin treatment, which downregulates g␣s in several tissues (5, 21, 29), blocked erk activation
by  xxxd2401xxx  (fig. 4b). these findings, implicating the
involvement of both gi and gs in the  xxxd2401xxx  response,
are consistent with a switch in g protein coupling by the
␤-adrenergic receptor in hsy cells. interestingly, treatment of
hsy cells with the pka inhibitor  xxxd477xxx  had no effect on
 xxxd2401xxx -induced erk activation (fig. 5a). thus, in
marked contrast to other cell types in which pertussis-sensitive
 xxxd2401xxx  responses were profoundly inhibited by  xxxd477xxx  (6),
hsy cells appear to undergo a switch in ␤-adrenergic receptor-g protein coupling without obvious involvement of pka. it
should be noted that the interpretation of data from experiments using  xxxd477xxx  could be limited by direct pka inhibition of
c-raf1, an activator of erks downstream of the egf receptor
and the gtpase ras (18). indeed, basal levels of erk phosphorylation in hsy cells tended to increase in the presence of

␤-adrenergic-induced erk activation in salivary cells

fig. 7. induction of cd44 expression by iso: involvement of the erk pathway. a: hsy cells were treated with vehicle (con), iso (10⫺5 m), egf (5 ⫻ 10⫺10
m), or  xxxd2388xxx  (5 ⫻ 10⫺4 m) alone or in combination with 2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4h-1-benzopyran-4-one ( xxxd1169xxx ; 5 ⫻ 10⫺5 m) or ag-1478 (5 ⫻
10⫺6 m) for 24 h. one million cells were incubated with mouse anti-human cd44, stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated rat anti-mouse antibody as the second
antibody, fixed in 2% formaldehyde, and subjected to flow cytometric analysis as described in materials and methods. fluorescence profiles representative of
3 independent experiments are shown. x-axis indicates relative fluorescence intensity indicative of cell surface cd44 expression, and y-axis shows cell number.
mean fluorescence of each sample is indicated by the number under each peak. shaded areas represent background fluorescence of cells incubated without

cell lysates were subjected to western blot analysis of phosphorylated and total  xxxg1369xxx /2 as described in materials and methods.

higher concentrations (⬎5 ⫻ 10⫺6 m) of  xxxd477xxx , even though
the  xxxd2401xxx  response remained unaffected (data not
shown). although our studies do not entirely exclude a possible role for pka in gs-to-gi switching in hsy cells, in
preliminary experiments  xxxd2401xxx -induced phosphorylation of the egf receptor (y1068) was unaffected by  xxxd477xxx  (not
shown).
earlier reports have proposed that, in contrast to the
gi-dependent pathway, a distinct, pertussis toxin-insensitive
pathway involving camp signaling may also mediate ␤-adrenergic receptor-induced activation of erks (9, 18). in
hsy cells pertussis toxin and ag-1478 produced only
partial inhibition of erk activation by the ␤-adrenergic
agonist (figs. 2 and 3). these findings suggested that
 xxxd2401xxx  activates  xxxg1369xxx /2 in hsy cells in part by a
signaling mechanism other than the gi-dependent pathway
involving transactivation of the egf receptor. like  xxxd2401xxx , the camp analog cpt-camp and camp-elevating
agents (cholera toxin and  xxxd2388xxx ) also activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 in
hsy cells (figs. 4 and 5). in preliminary experiments (not
shown) the activating effect of cpt-camp on erk phosphorylation was not blocked by the egf receptor inhibitor
ag-1478. these results suggest the presence in hsy cells
of a camp-mediated pathway of  xxxd2401xxx -induced
erk activation independent of the gi-mediated cascade.
the determination of whether the two distinct pathways
coexist within individual hsy cells or are present in different cell subpopulations requires further investigation. of
note, partial pertussis toxin sensitivity of isoproterenolajp-cell physiol • vol

induced erk activation has also been reported in some (but
not all) isolates of hek-293 cells (18); this observation,
which is analogous to our own finding in hsy cells (fig. 3),
is consistent with coexisting gi-dependent and -independent
pathways within individual hek-293 cells but could also
reflect heterogeneity of signaling pathways in different
subpopulations of the same cell line. interestingly, in a
recent study of glioblastoma cells, pma-induced activation
of  xxxg1369xxx /2 also appeared to involve both egf receptordependent and -independent pathways (1).
gi-independent activation of erks by ␤-adrenergic receptor-stimulated camp production is thought to be mediated by
pka and/or the camp-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange
factor epac (exchange protein directly activated by camp),
which in turn cause sequential activation of the downstream
intermediates rap1 and b-raf (18, 19, 30). in hsy cells
stimulation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 by the camp-elevating agents  xxxd2388xxx 
and cholera toxin was unaffected by pretreatment of cells with
 xxxd477xxx  (fig. 5). thus we found no evidence in hsy cells for
pka involvement in erk activation by camp, although as
noted above experiments using  xxxd477xxx  may be difficult to interpret, given the complex actions of pka on erk activation in
any given cell type. we have detected immunoreactive epac
and b-raf in hsy cells (data not shown), yet it remains to be
determined whether  xxxd2401xxx  stimulation of erks in these
cells might occur via an epac-rap1-b-raf signaling cascade.
src tyrosine kinases are thought to act as early signaling
intermediates in both g␤␥-mediated egf receptor transactivation and pka-dependent erk activation induced by gpcr

␤-adrenergic-induced erk activation in salivary cells

stimulation (18, 19, 30). in our studies of hsy cells,  xxxd2401xxx -responsive phosphorylation of the egf receptor was
attenuated by the src inhibitor  xxxd1307xxx , whereas src inhibition by
either  xxxd1307xxx  or transfection of a dnsrc blocked the erk response to ␤-adrenergic agonist (fig. 6). these findings suggest
that src is required for egf receptor transactivation and
possibly additional signaling events essential to erk activation by  xxxd2401xxx . however, the precise target(s) for src
regulation in gi- and/or camp-mediated pathways of  xxxd2401xxx  action remains to be identified.
although ␤-adrenergic receptors are linked to the erk cascade
in multiple cell types, functional responses to the erk-mediated
actions of  xxxd2401xxx  may be cell type specific. of particular
note in this regard, the growth-promoting effects of  xxxd2401xxx 
appear to be specific for the salivary gland and a few other tissues
(i.e., pancreas and heart) (3, 27). the specificity of target cell
responsiveness to ␤-adrenergic receptor signaling through the
erk pathway may reside, at least in part, in the downstream
effectors generated in any given cell type. the cd44 proteins are
a family of transmembrane glycoproteins thought to regulate cell
proliferation, survival, and differentiation through transduction of
signals originating in the extracellular matrix (24). cd44 is
present in normal human salivary tissue and has been proposed to
play a role in adult salivary gland regeneration and/or regrowth (8,
24). moreover, in some tissues, alterative splicing of the cd44
gene is regulated by activation of the erk pathway (32). in the
current study,  xxxd2401xxx  treatment of hsy cells caused a
profound increase in surface cd44 expression, which was completely blocked by the erk pathway inhibitor  xxxd1169xxx  (fig. 7).
thus cd44 could function as a downstream target mediating
salivary cell growth responsive to ␤-adrenergic receptorinduced activation of the erk pathway. egf and  xxxd2388xxx 
were each found to increase cd44 expression, suggesting
the involvement of both egf receptor and camp signaling
pathways in  xxxd2401xxx -induced regulation of cd44. although treatment of cells over 24 h with the egf receptor
inhibitor ag-1478 completely blocked  xxxd2401xxx -induced cd44 expression, whether prolonged exposure to
ag-1478 might have adverse effects on both pathways
implicated in  xxxd2401xxx  signaling requires further elucidation.
in summary, we propose that activation of ␤-adrenergic receptors in hsy cells induces the mitogenic signaling pathways
depicted schematically in fig. 8. distinct pathways of erk
activation mediated by gi-dependent transactivation of egf receptors or camp signaling processes have been individually
demonstrated in several cell types (18, 19). to our knowledge,
however, the coexistence of both pathways operating simultaneously in a single cell line has not been described previously. in
hsy cells, both pathways appear to be gs dependent because
 xxxd2401xxx -induced phosphorylation of erks was abolished
under conditions (i.e., prolonged incubation with cholera toxin)
found to downregulate g␣s in other systems (5, 21, 29). hence, in
fig. 8, the two signaling pathways are shown to diverge at a step
involving either g␣s activation of adenylyl cyclase or switching of
␤-adrenergic receptor coupling from g␣s to g␣i (18). although
the process of g protein switching is generally thought to require
pka-mediated phosphorylation of the ␤-adrenergic receptor, we
found no evidence to indicate that  xxxd2401xxx -responsive
erk activation in hsy cells is pka dependent; nonetheajp-cell physiol • vol

agonist binding to the ␤-ar in hsy cells is proposed to activate  xxxg1369xxx /2
via 2 coexisting signaling cascades: 1) g␣i-mediated transactivation of
egfr, with resultant activation of the ras/c-raf1 pathway (right), and 2)
generation of camp via stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (ac) and activation of rap1/b-raf signaling (left). signaling intermediates tested in this
study are shown in bold type. the sequence of individual signaling
intermediates involved in the 2 pathways is adapted from recent consensus
views of g protein-coupled receptor-mediated erk activation (18, 19, 30).
the precise involvement of src in  xxxd2401xxx -induced erk activation
remains to be identified.

less, a possible role for pka in gi- and/or camp-mediated
signaling pathways has not been fully excluded. finally, the
identification of cd44 as a likely effector downstream of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 is also summarized in fig. 8. in a related study (34),
we recently reported that egf receptor-mediated stimulation of erks in hsy cells increases expression of ␤-adrenergic receptors coupled to activation of adenylyl cyclase.
additional investigations are required to clarify the mechanisms by which cross-talk between ␤-adrenergic receptorand receptor  xxxg2198xxx -linked pathways elicits mitogenic signals promoting tissue-specific growth of salivary
gland cells.
