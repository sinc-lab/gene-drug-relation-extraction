a flock of rambouillet sheep experienced unexpected lamb mortality associated with excessive bleeding at the time of parturition.
most lambs died of blood loss through the umbilicus or into subcutaneous tissues. subsequently, nine ewes which had previously
delivered lambs that bled to death were bred to the suspected sire of the previous bleeding lambs. fifteen lambs were born alive the
following spring, and three males and one female bled clinically. these lambs had markedly decreased  xxxg752xxx  (< 16%) and factor
x (< 4%) activities, with variably decreased factor ii (11-36%) and  xxxg750xxx  (20-37%) activities. protein c chromogenic activity
was also markedly decreased (< 1%) in these lambs. the results from crossed immunoelectrophoresis and ‘protein-induced-in-
vitamin-k-absence’ determination of the plasma of affected lambs, with antiserum directed against coagulation  xxxg741xxx , protein c
or proteins s, suggested that these proteins were not carboxylated normally. examination of liver from one lamb in the first batch
and the four subsequent lambs did not reveal a known  xxxd3522xxx  antagonist. the breeding data suggested that the coagulopathy
in these sheep was inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. the genetic or molecular defect that exists in these lambs is unknown,
but possibilities include abnormal y-glutamyl carboxylase activity or abnormal metabolism of  xxxd3522xxx . blood coag fibrinol 10:75-—

introduction

human hemostasis because of their size, ease of
handling, and the similarity between the coagulation
factor activities of neonatal lambs and human

hereditary coagulation factor defects have been
observed in a wide variety of domestic animal
species and have been utilized as models of human

hemostasis [1,2]. with few exceptions, most breeds
of animals and species have low numbers of affected
or carrier animals because of the ability of producers
to remove affected animals from the gene pool.
novel coagulopathies in domestic animals are valu-
able as models of human coagulation when they
occur and should be preserved for detailed examina-
tion.

sheep have been advocated as an animal model of

neonates [3]. fetal sheep and humans have low
vitamin-k-dependent coagulation factors during the
last trimester of gestation compared with the adult,
and have similar activity levels of other coagulation
factors [4-7]. lambs have been utilized in models of
human coagulation disorders, including respiratory
distress syndrome, catheter thrombus formation,
necrotizing enterocolitis, and neonatal thrombosis in
infants of diabetic mothers [8-11]. factor viii

deficiency ( xxxg751xxx ) is the most commonly
reported hereditary coagulopathy in domestic ani-
mals, and is the only coagulation factor deficiency
reported thus far in sheep [12]. this report describes
a unique, congenital, hereditary coagulopathy simi-
lar to those reported in humans and devon rex cats
[13-19]. determination of the genetic and molecular
defect present in these sheep may provide insight
regarding normal carboxylation of coagulation fac-
tors, or the regulation of coagulation factor synthesis
in sheep, and may serve as a useful model of human
coagulation.

materials and methods

a herd of 480 commercial, pure-bred, rambouillet
ewes experienced an unusually high lamb mortality
rate during the first week of the lambing season.
affected lambs were born alive and would suckle,
but then would continue to bleed from the umbili-
cus and exsanguinate within 24h of birth. repeated
administration of  xxxd3522xxx  and blood transfusions
in one affected lamb resulted in clinical improve-
ment for only 5-7-day intervals before bleeding
resumed, at necropsy, lesions in affected lambs
included tissue pallor, extensive subcutaneous he-
morrhage over the trunk and cranium, umbilical
hemorrhage, and multiple hemarthroses. no other
abnormalities were detected by gross or histologic
examination of these lambs. in all cases, the ewes
and the fraternal twins of affected lambs did not
bleed clinically. all ewes in the herd were fed whole
corn and high quality alfalfa hay cut from land that
did not contain sweet clover.

subsequent to the initial observation of excessive
bleeding in neonatal lambs, nine ewes that had had
lambs which bled in previous years were bred by a
ram from the herd that was suspected of being the
sire of the previous bleeding lambs. fifteen lambs
were born alive the following year to these nine
ewes, of which three males and one female bled
excessively at birth. these four lambs were anesthe-
tized (100 mg ketamine, subcutaneously), a 20-gauge
catheter was placed in the jugular vein for blood
collection, and they were then necropsied following
blood collection. liver was collected in order to
examine for known  xxxd3522xxx  antagonists.

blood from an initially affected lamb (lamb
henry), the four affected lambs (97-1, 97-2, 97-3,
97-4), an unaffected day-old lamb, and the dams and
sire of these four lambs was collected in siliconized
glass tubes (vacutainer; becton dickinson, franklin
lakes, new jersey, usa) containing either no anti-
coagulant, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (edta),

76 blood coagulation and fibrinolysis 1999, vol 10, no 2

or 3.8% sodium citrate (1:9 v/v) for a cbc, serum
biochemistry and coagulation studies.

prothrombin time and activated partial
thromboplastin time

the prothrombin time was determined using ortho
brain thromboplastin (ortho diagnostic system,
raritan, new jersey, usa), and the activated partial
thromboplastin time (aptt) using thrombosil 1
(ortho diagnostic system). procedures were per-
formed according to the manufacturers’ instructions
using a mla electra 700 device (mla, pleasant-
ville, new york, usa).

fibrinogen

fibrinogen concentration was determined in affected
lambs by a modified thrombin time using the
dupont aca device (wilmington, delaware, usa),
or the mla electra 700 device and bovine thrombin
(ortho diagnostic system).

factor ii, v, vit, vii, ix, x, xi, and xii
activities

functional coagulation assays were performed using
an mla electra 700 device and were reported as
percentage activity compared with pooled sheep
plasma (100% activity) from five, adult, mixed-breed
ewes. factor assays used commercially available
human deficient plasma as substrates, which were
obtained from george king biomedical (overland
park, kansas, usa).

protein c plasma activity

protein c activity was determined in the plasma of
lambs 97-1, 97-2, 97-3, 97-4, a normal neonatal
lamb, the dams, and the sire using a synthetic
substrate (spectrolyse® protein c; biopool, ontar-
io, canada). pooled sheep plasma from five adult,
mixed-breed ewes was used as a standard and was
designated 100% activity.

 xxxd3522xxx  antagonists

a screen for the detection of  xxxd3522xxx  antagonists
(which included  xxxd1875xxx ) was assayed in fresh
frozen liver from lamb henry and lambs 97-1, 97-2,
97-3, and 97-4 using previously described methods
(animal health diagnostic laboratory, lansing,
michigan, usa) [20].

 xxxg741xxx , protein c, and  xxxg1850xxx  antigen and
protein-induced-in-vitamin-k-absence

sheep  xxxg741xxx , protein c, and  xxxg1850xxx  antigen
concentrations were determined using laurell rocket
immunoelectrophoresis [21] in selected lamb plas-
mas utilizing polyclonal, anti-sheep  xxxg741xxx , protein
c, or protein § antibodies produced and validated as
previously described [8]. the pooled sheep plasma
described above was considered to have 100%
antigen concentration.

sheep non-carboxylated protein, or protein-in-
duced-in-vitamin-k-absence (pivka) was deter-
mined using a barium absorption of plasma followed
by laurell rocket immunoelectrophoresis of the
supernatant using rabbit, polyclonal anti-ovine fac-
tor x, protein c, or  xxxg1850xxx  antibodies produced
as previously described [8]. briefly, 1% agarose gels
for laurell rocket immunoelectrophoresis were
poured using seakem me agarose (fmc biopro-
ducts, rockland, maine, usa), a buffer consisting
of 0.03 mol/l  xxxd285xxx , 0.016 mol/l tris, 0.0017 mol/l
edta (ph 8.6) and 0.01% sodium azide, and
appropriate anti-sheep factor antibodies. for the
pivka antigens, bacl, was added to citrated
plasma samples to a final concentration of 0.1 mol/l.
the plasma samples/barium citrate precipitate were
slowly shaken for 30 min at 22°c and then centri-
fuged for 10 min  xxxd1891xxx * x g. the supernatant was
drawn off and applied to the gel. all gels were
visualized using coomassie blue staining. all factor
antigen levels were measured against a sheep pool
plasma standard that was assigned a normal antigen
amount of 100%. the coefficient of variation for the
pivka and antigen assays was 15%.

crossed immunoelectrophoresis of sheep  xxxg741xxx ,
protein c, and  xxxg1850xxx 

crossed immunoelectrophoresis is a two-dimen-
sional variant of laurell rocket immunoelectrophor-
esis which can detect qualitative abnormalities of
proteins. plasma from lamb henry, normal twin
lamb, normal adult pooled sheep, and lamb 97-1

coagulation factor carboxylation defect

were assayed by crossed immunoelectrophoresis
using either an anti-ovine  xxxg741xxx , protein c, or
 xxxg1850xxx $ antibodies produced as described pre-
viously [8], with 0.004 mol/l ca?*+ (calcium chloride)
added to the gel.

results

the initial lamb (lamb henry) and all four lambs
from the subsequent year had a markedly prolonged
aptt, and a prolonged prothrombin time (table 1).
the prothrombin time and aptt were not shor-
tened after dilution of plasma 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, or 1:5
with saline when repeated, and were fully corrected
to normal times when mixed 1:1 with normal
plasma. this suggests that an inhibitor of coagula-
tion was not present. the range of aptts and
prothrombin times of the dams, sire, and normal
lamb were normal (table 1), with day-old-lamb
times being the longest compared with adults.

the four lambs had a severe deficiency of factor
ix and x activities, with variable decreases in
factors ii and vii activities (table 1). coagulation
factor v, viii, xi, and xii activities were normal or
slightly elevated in these lambs.

crossed immunoelectrophoresis of lamb henry’s
plasma demonstrated reduced  xxxg741xxx  antigen, as
well as a faster, single, anodal migrating peak com-
pared with pooled sheep plasma, consistent with
non-carboxylated  xxxg741xxx  (fig. 1). immunoelectro-
phoresis of plasma from lamb 97-1 revealed a similar
pattern with either anti-protein-c, anti-protein-s, or
anti-factor-x antibody suggesting decreased  xxxd2809xxx -
ylation of protein c,  xxxg1850xxx , or  xxxg741xxx  in lamb
97-1 as well as in lamb henry.

plasma pivka results for  xxxg741xxx , protein c, and
 xxxg1850xxx  are listed in table 2, and pictured in figure 1.

ing platelet numbers.

discussion

the clinical bleeding observed in a newborn lamb
from an inbred flock of rambouillet sheep was
examined in detail initially in one affected lamb, and
in four subsequently affected lambs of known
breeding. lamb henry had a severe coagulopathy,
as demonstrated by a markedly prolonged aptt and
prothrombin time. this could not be attributed to a
circulating inhibitor because dilution of plasma did
not shorten the coagulation time, nor was a known
 xxxd3522xxx  antagonist found in liver samples. af-
fected lamb plasma exhibited markedly decreased
coagulation  xxxg752xxx , x, and protein c with
variably decreased factor ii and vii activities. other
coagulation factor activities and fibrinogen concen-
trations were similar to those reported previously
for newborn lambs [6,7,22,23]. this pattern of
coagulation factor deficiency suggests defective car-
boxylation, since all these factors require post-
translational carboxylation for normal activity.
crossed immunoelectrophoresis of lamb henry’s
plasma demonstrated decreased immunologically re-
active  xxxg741xxx , which migrated faster anodally than
pooled sheep plasma  xxxg741xxx .  xxxg741xxx , protein c
and protein $ from lamb 97-1 also migrated faster
anodally than the comparable pooled sheep plasma
proteins. this migration pattern is compatible with
inadequate carboxylation of  xxxg741xxx ,  xxxg1850xxx  and
protein c in calcium-containing gels, and is similar
to crossed immunoelectrophoresis patterns in pa-
tients receiving coumadin [23]. abnormal carboxyla-
tion of coagulation factors has been detected in
patients with hepatic injury, cholestasis, deficiency
of  xxxd3522xxx  or antagonists of  xxxd3522xxx  [24-26],
but no evidence of these were detected by serum
biochemistry or at necropsy in the lambs. some
plants contain coumarin-like compounds which,
when consumed, can cause  xxxd3522xxx  antagonism,
but no naturally occurring or commercially prepared

coagulation factor carboxylation defect

 xxxd3522xxx  antagonists were detected in liver speci-
mens.

the combination of factor deficiencies and abnor-
mal immunoelectrophoresis migration patterns ob-
served in these lambs is probably related to detective
processing that is common to factors ii, vii, ix, x,
and proteins c and s. all these factors are carboxy-
lated on the inner face of the endoplasmic reticulum
[27]. hereditary post-translational carboxylation de-
fects of factors ii, vii, ix, and x have been
described in cats and humans [13-19]. most vita-
min-k-dependent factor activities have been de-
creased in these cases.

because four of 15 lambs born had a coagulo-
pathy, the affected lambs were both male and
female, and neither the carrier ram nor the ewes had
a detectable coagulation defect, the inheritance
pattern of this defect is most compatible with an
autosomal recessive trait. heterozygote carriers have
normal vitamin-k-dependent coagulation factor ac-
tivities, as evidenced by the coagulation factor
activities of the carrier ewes and ram. the molecular
defect in this flock of sheep is unknown, but may
reflect defective synthesis or function of hepatic y-
glutamyl carboxylase. alternatively,  xxxd3522xxx  oxi-
dation or reduction, absorption, or hepatic uptake
may be abnormal and rate-limiting for carboxylation
to occur. further examination of these sheep is
required in order to determine the specific genetic
and molecular mutation resulting in defective car-
boxylation.
