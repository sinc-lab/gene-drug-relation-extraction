abstract
familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) can be
caused by mutations in copper, zinc-superoxide dismutase
(sod1). mice expressing sod1 mutants demonstrate a
robust neuroinflammatory reaction characterized, in part, by
up-regulation of  xxxg2296xxx  alpha ( xxxg2296xxx ) and its
primary receptor  xxxg2300xxx . in an effort to identify small molecule
inhibitors of neuroinflammation useful in treatment of als, a
microglial culture system was established to identify  xxxg2296xxx 
antagonists. walker eoc-20 microglia cells were stimulated
with recombinant  xxxg2296xxx , with or without inhibitors, and the cell
response was indexed by no2– output. three hundred and
fifty-five rationally selected compounds were included in this
bioassay. the  xxxg147xxx  (5lox) and
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor  xxxd2748xxx  ( xxxd2748xxx ), a
natural dicatechol, was one of the most potent non-cytotoxic

levels of  xxxg2296xxx  a ( xxxg2296xxx ) have been found to
be increased in the cns of transgenic mice expressing
mutant copper, zinc-superoxide dismutase (sod1) enzymes
that cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als). in a
rapidly progressing strain of mouse that expresses a
gly93 ﬁ ala93 mutant sod1, levels of both  xxxg2296xxx  and its
primary receptor  xxxg2300xxx  are raised at late presymptomatic
stages of disease (hensley et al. 2002, 2003; yoshihara et al.
2002). expression of both cytokine and receptor continues to
increase during the paralytic phase of disease (hensley et al.

antagonists tested (ic50 8 ± 3 lm). investigation of the g93asod1 mouse model for als revealed increased message and
protein levels of 5lox at 120 days of age. oral  xxxd2748xxx 
(2500 p.p.m.) significantly extended lifespan and slowed motor dysfunction in this mouse, when administration was begun
relatively late in life (90 days).  xxxd2748xxx  extended median total
lifespan of g93a-sod1 mice by 10%, and life expectancy
following start of treatment was extended by 32%. diseaseassociated gliosis and cleaved microtubule-associated tau
protein, an indicator of axon damage, were likewise reduced
by  xxxd2748xxx . thus,  xxxg2296xxx  antagonists and especially 5lox
inhibitors might offer new opportunities for treatment of als.

2002, 2003; yoshihara et al. 2002). in this mouse,
up-regulation of the  xxxg2296xxx  system largely precedes transcriptional up-regulation of other pro-inﬂammatory gene
products and temporally correlates with progression of the
disease (hensley et al. 2002, 2003). similar elaboration of
pro-inﬂammatory cytokines has been reported in slowly
progressing strains of g93a-sod1 transgenic mice and in
g37r-sod1 mice (elliot 2001; nguyen et al. 2001; kriz
et al. 2002). finally, both  xxxg2296xxx  and soluble tnf receptor
levels are raised in serum of humans with als (poloni et al.
2000).  xxxg2296xxx  is a potent pro-inﬂammatory cytokine capable
of activating microglia and causing neurotoxicity in systems
in which neurons have previously been compromised, for
instance by accumulation of aggregated proteins (robertson
et al. 2001). it is therefore likely that  xxxg2296xxx  is a signiﬁcant
contributing factor to the pathogenesis of als.
based on these ﬁndings, a microglial cell culture assay
was established to screen compounds for  xxxg2296xxx  antagonism
in the hope that such agents would have value in the
treatment of als. walker eoc-20 murine microglia cells
were treated with recombinant  xxxg2296xxx , with or without
inhibitors, and cell response was determined by no2– release
into the culture medium. a panel of 355 rationally selected
compounds was assessed for ability to inhibit no2– production. a series of  xxxg147xxx  (5lox)
inhibitors were found to be especially potent  xxxg2296xxx  antagonists. the natural dicatechol  xxxd2748xxx 
( xxxd2748xxx ), a selective 5lox inhibitor from the creosote plant
(larrea tridentata: zygophyllaceae), was the most potent
member of this series.
the cell culture ﬁndings prompted an investigation of
5lox expression in spinal cords of g93a-sod1 mice. in
spinal cord from 120-day-old transgenic mice, levels of
5lox mrna and protein were signiﬁcantly increased. on
the basis that 5lox antagonists might provide therapeutic
beneﬁt in als, an observer-blinded study was conducted to
determine the efﬁcacy of oral  xxxd2748xxx  against murine als.
dietary administration of  xxxd2748xxx  (2500 p.p.m.) signiﬁcantly
extended lifespan and delayed motor deterioration in the
g93a-sod1 mice when treatment was begun at a latter stage
of disease.

materials and methods
microglial cultures and manipulations
walker eoc-20 cells (walker et al. 1995; hensley et al. 2003) and
 xxxd1653xxx  murine ﬁbroblasts were obtained from the american tissue
type collection (rockville, md, usa). eoc-20 cells are a well
characterized, non-virus-transformed,  xxxg526xxx -1dependent mouse microglial cell line that expresses typical
macrophage cell surface markers including igg receptors fccri
and ii, mac-1, mac-2, mac-3, cd45 and  xxxg396xxx  (walker et al. 1995).
eoc-20 microglia express major histocompatibility complex

(mhc)-i constitutively and express mhc-ii in response to
c-interferon (walker et al. 1995). eoc-20 cells therefore closely
resemble primary macrophages and microglia with respect to the
presence and inducibility of cell-surface antigens. the response of
eoc-20 cells to archetypal inﬂammatory stimuli has been described
recently (hensley et al. 2003).
eoc-20 cells were grown in 75-cm2 cell culture ﬂasks until
passaged into 24-well cell culture plates. cells were maintained in
dulbecco’s minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum and 20%  xxxd1653xxx  ﬁbroblast-conditioned medium.  xxxd1653xxx 
cells secrete  xxxg526xxx -1, which promotes microglial
proliferation. recombinant murine  xxxg2296xxx  was obtained from
calbiochem (san diego, ca, usa) or sigma chemical (st louis,
mo, usa) and reconstituted in phosphate-buffered saline plus 4%
endotoxin-free bovine  xxxg124xxx . the dose of  xxxg2296xxx  was
determined for each batch of cytokine in order to stimulate a 24-h
no2– production of approximately 25 lm (typically 20 ng/ml
 xxxg2296xxx ).
eoc-20 cells were treated with test compounds dissolved in
dimthylsulfoxide (dmso), or with dmso vehicle alone (1% ﬁnal
volume) for 30 min before challenge with  xxxg2296xxx . each test agent
was administered at serial 1 : 5 dilutions from 100 lm down to
800 nm, with four replicate wells per dose. after stimulation for
24 h with  xxxg2296xxx , the culture medium was removed and assayed for
no2– using the griess assay (marzinzig et al. 1997) with
commercially available diazotization reagents (labchem inc.,
pittsburg, pa, usa). no2– concentrations were interpolated to
calculate the concentration of drug that suppressed  xxxg2296xxx -induced
no2– by 50% (ic50 value). the medium was then replaced with
dulbecco’s minimal essential medium lacking phenol red indicator.
a commercially available mts reagent [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethonyphenol)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium,
inner salt; promega, madison, wi, usa] was added to each well
according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. after incubation
for 30–45 min at 37c, aliquots of medium were removed and
evaluated spectrophotometrically at 540 nm. a blank was prepared
in which the mts solution was incubated in the absence of cells;
this was taken to indicate 0% viability. viability was formally
calculated as the ratio of od540 in the drug-treated wells, relative to
the same variable measured in wells treated with  xxxg2296xxx  alone, after
subtraction of the blank. an agent was considered cytotoxic if the
ratio of ld50 to ic50 was less than 10. synthetic mesonordihydroguaiaretic acid [ xxxd2748xxx  or 1,4- xxxd3014xxx ,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2,3-dimethylbutane] was obtained from sigma or aldrich
(milwaukee, wi, usa) and used in all animal experiments as well
as most cell culture experiments. in speciﬁc cell culture experiments
natural  xxxd2748xxx  was obtained from sigma. elisas for leukotriene b4
(ltb4) and  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) were purchased from cayman
chemical (san diego, ca, usa).
g93a-sod1 mice, drug and diets
mice expressing high copy numbers of human mutant g93a-sod1
were obtained from jackson laboratories (bar harbor, me, usa)
[strain designation b6sjl-tgn-(sod1 g93a)-1-gur; gurney et al.
1994, 1996, 1998]. transgenic mice were maintained in the
hemizygous state by mating g93a males with b6sjl-tgn females.
animals were fed ad libitum standard ain93g diets or the same
diets formulated with  xxxd2748xxx  at 2500 p.p.m. with drug administration

 xxxg2296xxx  antagonists in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 135

started at 90 days. at this stage of life, g93a-sod1 animals begin
to demonstrate motor weakness and ﬁne limb tremors (guégan and
przedborski 2003). the feeding study used 16 mice per group. the
group receiving  xxxd2748xxx  consisted of ﬁve male and 11 female mice;
the control group consisted of four male and 12 female mice. all
diets and dietary drug formulations were provided by dyets, inc.
(bethlehem, pa, usa). all animal procedures were reviewed and
approved by the oklahoma medical research foundation institutional animal care and use committee (iacuc) in accordance
with national institutes of health (nih) guidelines.
motor performance was evaluated by means of a rotarod task, by
a technician blinded to the treatment groups. mice were placed on a
horizontal rod that was made to rotate at 1 r.p.m. with an
acceleration rate of 1 r.p.m. every 10 s until the animal fell from
the rod. each animal was tested three times per trial. rotarod tests
were conducted at 90 days (baseline), 100 days of age and
subsequent 5-day intervals. animals were killed when no longer
able to right themselves within 10 s of being placed on their sides.
statistical analyses were performed using the graphpad prismtm
statistical analysis package (graphpad inc., san diego, ca, usa).
semiquantitative rt–pcr
total rna was isolated from spinal cords of non-transgenic control
and g93a+ transgenic mice by using tri reagent (sigma)
according to the supplier’s protocol. samples of rna (5 lg) were
reverse transcribed using oligo(dt)15 to prime the reaction in the
presence of avian myeloblastosis virus (amv) rt (roche,
indianapolis, in, usa) following the manufacturer’s protocol. on
completion, each reaction was diluted to a ﬁnal volume of 50 ll
with te buffer (10 mm tris, 1 mm edta, ph 8.0). pcr ampliﬁcation of a 309-bp 5lox gene product from the above-described
mouse cdnas was accomplished with taq dna polymerase
(roche), utilizing the buffer supplied and ﬁnal concentrations of
1.5 mm mgcl2, 0.2 mm of each dntp and 0.3 lm of each primer.
final reaction volumes were 50 ll. mouse 5lox primers were 5¢ggcaccgacgactacatctac-3¢ (forward) and 5¢-caattttgcacgtccatccc-3¢ (reverse).  xxxg53xxx  primers [5¢cggccaggtcatcactattg-3¢
(forward)
and
actcctgcttgctgatccac-3¢ (reverse)] yielding a 353-bp pcr
product were used as normalization controls. the number of pcr
ampliﬁcation cycles was determined empirically to yield detectable
product bands that were approximately linear with respect to initial
cdna concentration. for 5lox, optimal cycling conditions were:
2 min at 94c, one cycle; 1 min at 94c, 1 min at 56c and 1 min
at 72c for 27 cycles; 7 min at 72c, one cycle. conditions for actin
primers were the same except that an annealing temperature of 54c
was used and 24 cycles were performed. samples of 25 ll from
each reaction were electrophoresed in 2% agarose/tbe [tris/borate/
edta buffer (0.09 m tris, 0.09 m borate, 0.002 m edta)] gels for
1.5 h, stained with ethidium bromide and photographed with a
nucleovision (nucleotech, westport, ct, usa) imaging system.
immunochemistry and histology
polyclonal anti-sod1 igg was purchased from chemicon (temecula, ca, usa). polyclonal anti-5lox igg was purchased from
cayman chemical. monoclonal anti-5lox was obtained from
transduction laboratories (lexington ky, usa). polyclonal antibody against glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (gfap) was purchased

from research diagnostics international (flanders, nj, usa). the
positive control for 5lox western blots was sl-29 ﬁbroblast lysate
(transduction laboratories; provided with the antibody). electrophoresis was performed on 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gels,
and bands were visualized with chemiluminescence detection
reagents (amersham, piscataway, nj, usa).
cleaved microtubule-associated tau protein (c-tau) was measured
in the heat-soluble fraction of total spinal cord lysate as described
previously (zemlan 1999; zemlan and jauch 1999; zemlan et al.
1999). spinal cord samples were homogenized in in 50 mm trishcl (ph 6.8), 0.3 m nacl, 1%  xxxd26xxx , 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride and 5 lm leupeptin. homogenates were
centrifuged at 30 000 g for 5 min at 4c. supernanants were boiled
for 10 min then centrifuged for 30 min at 30 000 g and 4c. the
ﬁnal supernatants were dialyzed overnight against 50 mm tris-hcl.
c-tau levels in these heat-soluble fractions were measured by
sandwich elisa as described previously, using afﬁnity-puriﬁed
monoclonal antibody 12b2 (zemlan 1999; zemlan and jauch 1999;
zemlan et al. 1999).
for immunohistochemistry, mice were terminally anesthetized
and perfused transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline, ph 7.4,
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer. the
spinal cord was removed and the lumbar l5 region was processed
for parafﬁn embedding. serial cross-sections of the l5 spinal cord
region were cut at 5 lm thickness. immunostaining was performed
using serial l5 spinal cord sections with antibodies to glial gfap
(dilution 5 lg/ml; chemicon). negative immunohistochemical
controls were treated in the same way but in the absence of primary
antibody. gfap-labeled sections were counterstained with hematoxylin.

microglia respond to  xxxg2296xxx , in part, by synthesizing no
(colton et al. 1994; hensley et al. 2003). no2–, an autoxidation product of  xxxd2738xxx  (no), can be measured by a
simple colorimetric assay of the cell medium (colton et al.
1994; marzinzig et al. 1997). pge2 can also be assessed to
indicate inﬂammatory transcription of cyclo-oxygenase
(cox)-ii. the no2– output of eoc-20 microglia is dependent on the  xxxg2296xxx  concentration(fig. 1a). three hundred and
ﬁfty-ﬁve individually selected, structurally distinct compounds were screened as inhibitors of  xxxg2296xxx -stimulated
no2– production. the test set was chosen, in part, to maximize
the number of targeted enzyme systems. speciﬁc test agents
were selected to represent known or suspected anti-inﬂammatory pharmacophores, or inhibitors of signal transduction
elements likely to be involved with an inﬂammatory event.
a range of  xxxg2296xxx -antagonizing activity was observed
among a group of compounds that block various enzymes of
 xxxd208xxx  metabolism (table 1). in particular, the
5lox-inhibiting natural dicatechols curcumin and  xxxd2748xxx

were both very effective, non-toxic antagonists of tnfastimulated microglial activation (figs 1b and c). the potency
of both compounds compared favorably with that of the
benchmark microglia inhibitor minocycline, which suppresses
microglial responses in animal models of als, huntington’s
disease and parkinson’s disease (chen et al. 2000; kriz et al.
2002; wu et al. 2002; zhu et al. 2002).  xxxd2748xxx  was approximately six times more potent than minocycline in vitro, with
an ic50 value of 8 ± 3 lm (data are presented as mean ± sd,
n ¼ 5 independent experiments) and no toxicity at 100 lm
(fig. 1b). signiﬁcant no2– suppression was observed at
800 nm  xxxd2748xxx . similar efﬁcacy was observed for natural and
synthetic  xxxd2748xxx , as well as for the acetyl ester of  xxxd2748xxx 
(table 1). interestingly,  xxxd2748xxx  also suppressed  xxxg2296xxx -stimulated pge2 production by eoc-20 cells with an ic50 of
841 nm, probably reﬂecting a suppression of cytokineinduced cox-ii expression.
a series of structurally distinct 5lox inhibitors was tested
for ability to block  xxxg2296xxx -induced no2– output by eoc-20
cells; these data are summarized in table 1.  xxxd403xxx 
phenethyl ester was approximately as effective as curcumin,
whereas other selective 5lox inhibitors were bioactive but

less potent. interestingly, tetra-o-methyl  xxxd2748xxx  (which does
not inhibit lox; whitman et al. 2002) displayed modest
bioactivity, although it was less potent than the parent
compound (table 1). variable activity was observed among
the several archetypal non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs
tested. indomethacin and ibuprofen displayed weak activity,
whereas the cox-ii selective inhibitor ns-398 was essentially inactive (table 1). in contrast, the cox-ii selective
inhibitor  xxxd2727xxx , which has recently been shown to
improve prognosis in als mice (pompl et al. 2003), was
active with an ic50 of 20 lm (table 1).  xxxd2748xxx  may have
general antioxidant activity; however, a broad series of
classical antioxidants (including monocatechols, hindered
phenolic chain-breaking antioxidants, thiol reducing agents,
sod and catalase mimetics) were generally inactive against
 xxxg2296xxx -stimulated no2– output (data not shown). exceptions
to this included compounds such as the glutathione peroxidase-mimicking, organoselenium compound ebselen, which
is known to be a potent but relatively non-selective lox
inhibitor (table 1 and schewe et al. 1994). the tnfaantagonizing effects of  xxxd2748xxx  are probably due to a
combination of activities including, but not restricted to,
the inhibition of 5lox.
5lox is increased in g93a-sod1 mouse spinal cord
as discussed above, it is likely that the  xxxg2296xxx -antagonizing
effects of  xxxd2748xxx  do not map exclusively to 5lox;

fig. 2 semiquantitative rt–pcr reveals raised levels of 5lox

cords of g93a-sod1 mice at 120 days (d) of age. nontg, nontransgenic.

nonetheless 5lox is the primary acknowledged target for
 xxxd2748xxx . we therefore decided to investigate whether 5lox
expression is affected by the g93a-sod1 transgene.
5lox expression was assessed at the message level by
semiquantitative rt–pcr and at the protein level by western
blot analysis. rt–pcr indicated a signiﬁcant increase in
5lox message at 120 days but not at 80 days. after 30
cycles of pcr ampliﬁcation, the 5lox pcr product was
increased two-fold in samples from g93a-sod1 mice
relative to those from non-transgenic mice (fig. 2). the
increase in 5lox message levels between 80 and 120 days
is reminiscent of similar trends documented recently for proinﬂammatory cytokines including interleukin,  xxxg2296xxx  and
 xxxg2300xxx  (hensley et al. 2002, 2003).
western blot analysis indicated a two-fold increase
in 5lox protein in g93a-sod1 mouse spinal cord

at 120 days, corroborating the rt–pcr results (fig. 3).
essentially no reactivity was observed when the same
samples were probed with antibodies against 12lox and
15lox (data not shown). thus 5lox expression was
similarly increased at both the message and protein levels of
analysis in symptomatic g93a-sod1 mice, suggesting a
transcriptional up-regulation of gene for 5lox within the
transgenic mouse spinal cord.
attempts were made to measure leukotrienes, the lipid
products of 5lox catalysis, in mouse spinal cord using
commercially available elisas. ltb4 increased slightly but
signiﬁcantly in the spinal cords from 120-day-old g93asod1 mice relative to levels in non-transgenic littermates
(44.5 ± 4.2 vs. 36.4 ± 4.2 ng ltb4 per mg protein respectively; p < 0.033 by t-test n ¼ 4 per group). only marginal
concentrations were observed for other leukotrienes (data not
shown). however, it should be noted that conditions have not
been optimized for extraction of leukotrienes from cns
tissue, and the elisa may suffer from limitations of
dynamic range and matrix effects.
oral  xxxd2748xxx  influences disease course in g93a-sod1
mice
expression of  xxxg2296xxx  and its receptor  xxxg2300xxx  begins to
increase at 80 days of age in the fast-progressing strain of
g93a-sod1 mouse (hensley et al. 2002, 2003; yoshihara
et al. 2002). however, an extreme rise in the level of these
two components is not observed until the paralytic stage of
disease (hensley et al. 2002, 2003). animals begin to
experience rapid decline of motor function at 100 days,
concomitant with neuron loss (gurney et al. 1994, 1996,
1998) (fig. 4a). thus it should be possible to antagonize
 xxxg2296xxx -dependent processes pharmacologically relatively late
in the life of the animal. based on this rationale,  xxxd2748xxx  was
administered orally to g93a-sod1 animals beginning at
90 days of age. this drug treatment signiﬁcantly altered the
course of disease, delaying motor dysfunction and extending
survival (fig. 4). oral  xxxd2748xxx  extended median lifespan by
13 days, representing a 32% increase in lifespan beyond the
start of treatment (fig. 4b; p < 0.002, log rank analysis;
n ¼ 16 animals/group). this 13-day extension of survival is
the same as that achieved by oral administration of riluzole,
the only currently approved als therapeutic agent, when
riluzole treatment is begun at 40–50 days of age (gurney
et al. 1996, 1998). the beneﬁt conferred by  xxxd2748xxx  is also
similar to that reported for minocycline, which increases the
lifespan of the fast-progressing g93a-sod1 mouse by
11 days when administration is begun  xxxd2274xxx  weeks of age
(zhu et al. 2002). it should be noted that in the g37r-sod1
mouse minocycline extended lifespan by 21 days (kriz et al.
2002), indicating mutation-speciﬁc drug efﬁcacies in murine
models of als.

weakness between 90 and 110 days of age, obvious signs of

oral  xxxd2748xxx  affects the onset of frank paralysis as well as duration of
the paralytic phase of disease in g93a-sod1 mice. data represent 16
animals per group; p values by t-test.

paralysis usually become evident at around 115 days. this
event can be deﬁned by a number of indicators, including an
altered leg-splaying response when the mouse is lifted by the
tail (gurney et al. 1996).  xxxd2748xxx  signiﬁcantly delayed the
onset of frank paralysis, as indicated by leg-splaying criteria
(table 2). the mean duration of the paralytic phase of
disease (time between onset of paralysis and death) was

extended approximately 40% by oral intake of  xxxd2748xxx , which
was marginally signiﬁcant at the 95% conﬁdence interval
(p ¼ 0.056, two-tailed t-test; table 2).
animal weight trends generally reﬂected survival and
rotarod performance data. mean animal weight began to
decrease in g93a-sod1 animals after 110 days (table 3).
by 120 days, median body mass was signiﬁcantly lower in
surviving control g93a-sod1 animals than in ndgatreated g93a-sod1 mice (p < 0.03; mann–whitney u-test).
astrogliosis, characterized in part by the enhanced
expression of gfap, is a homotypic response of astroglia
to diverse types of cns injury (little and o’callagha 2001).
it is a major tissue-level phenotype associated with g93asod1 transgene expression (hall et al. 1998; drachman
et al. 2002). recent studies of cox-ii inhibitors have shown
that suppression of astrogliosis with non-steroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs correlates with improved prognosis in
the g93a-sod1 mouse model (drachman et al. 2002).
accordingly, astrogliosis was investigated immunochemically as a function of  xxxd2748xxx  administration. as shown in
fig. 5, oral  xxxd2748xxx  diminished astrogliosis in the lumbar
spinal region of 120-day-old g93a-sod1 mice relative to
that in transgenic mice fed a control diet.
microtubule-associated tau protein is an axonally localized protein that experiences caspase-dependent proteolytic
cleavage at n- and c-termini upon neuronal damage
(zemlan 1999; zemlan and jauch 1999; zemlan et al.
1999). monoclonal antibodies have been developed that
exhibit a 1000-fold higher afﬁnity for c-tau than full-length
tau (zemlan et al. 1999). increases in c-tau cleavage
accurately index experimental neuronal damage in several
conditions, including stroke and traumatic brain injury
(zemlan et al. 1999). in the present study, elisas for
c-tau were used to determine axonal damage in als mouse
spinal cords as a function of animal age and drug treatment.
as illustrated in fig. 6, spinal cord concentrations of c-tau
increased markedly between 80 and 120 days of age in

oral  xxxd2748xxx  did not signiﬁcantly decrease ltb4 levels in
the small group of animals assayed. however, caveats
regarding leukotriene measurement in cns tissue should
be noted as described above. taken together these data
indicate that oral  xxxd2748xxx  positively inﬂuenced disease course
in the g93a-sod1 mouse model of als.
discussion

fig. 5 reduction of astrogliosis and axon loss in g93a-sod1
mice induced by oral  xxxd2748xxx . lumbar spinal cord sections from nontransgenic (a) and 120-day-old g93a-sod1 mice fed either a basal
diet (b) or diet containing  xxxd2748xxx  (c) were labeled with anti-gfap
(magnification · 40).

g93a-sod1 mice. the increase in c-tau approximately
correlated with diminution of motor function (fig. 4),
elaboration of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (hensley et al.
2002, 2003), and increased protein oxidative damage
(hensley et al. 2002). these results indicate that c-tau is
a convenient marker for neuropathy in the g93a-sod1
mouse. oral  xxxd2748xxx  administration, begun at 90 days,
resulted in a decrease in c-tau at 120 days that closely
approached statistical signiﬁcance (p ¼ 0.062; two-tailed
t-test) (fig. 6).

murine models of als exhibit a dynamic neuroinﬂammatory
component manifest by elaboration of pro- and antiinﬂammatory cytokines, with a very limited involvement of
peripheral lymphocytes (elliot et al. 2001; nguyen et al.
2001; hensley et al. 2002, 2003; kriz et al. 2002; yoshihara
et al. 2002). a particular need exists to identify inﬂammatory
components that inititate or drive disease progression in
als. our ﬁndings suggest that  xxxg2296xxx  and its primary
receptor  xxxg2300xxx  are among the earliest responding cytokine
components in the g93a-sod1 mouse (hensley et al.
2002). moreover both  xxxg2296xxx  and  xxxg2300xxx  expression
increase through the progression phase of disease (hensley
et al. 2002, 2003). because  xxxg2296xxx  is a potent activator of
microglia and contributes to tissue damage in classical
inﬂammation, it is plausible that it might contribute to als
pathology. it should be noted that  xxxg2296xxx  also has positive
effects on neuron viability in some excitotoxicity paradigms
(gary et al. 1998). determination of the true importance of
 xxxg2296xxx  in the pathogenesis of als must await animal genetic
experiments wherein  xxxg2296xxx  or its receptor is ablated in the
presence of sod1 mutant transgenes. nonetheless, an
exploration of  xxxg2296xxx  biology might yield candidate pharmacological treatments for the neuroinﬂammatory component of
als. the present study shows that naturally occurring
dicatechols that inhibit 5lox also antagonize  xxxg2296xxx  in
microglial cultures. one compound,  xxxd2748xxx , slows disease
progression in a fast-progressing strain of g93a-sod1
mouse when administered orally beginning at 90 days of age,

when subtle symptoms become evident (guégan and przedborski 2003).
our ﬁndings suggest that the 5lox pathway may be
involved with neuroinﬂammation in the g93a-sod1 mouse.
considerable attention has been given to cox as an
inﬂammatory contributor to neurological disease (mcgeer
and mcgeer 2001), but lox has been studied less. 5lox
selectively oxidizes  xxxd208xxx  into a lipid hydroperoxide,
as the ﬁrst step in production of leukotriene end-products
(funk 2001; bigby 2002; haeggstr}
om and wetterholm 2002;
whitman et al. 2002) (fig. 7). the 5lox inhibitor  xxxd2748xxx 
diminishes infarct volume after stroke (shishido et al. 2001)
but  xxxd2748xxx  has not been widely investigated in animal
models of neurological disease.  xxxd2748xxx  selectively inhibits
5lox over 12lox, 15lox and cox, with reported ki
values of 200 nm, 30 lm, 30 lm and 100 lm respectively
(salari et al. 1984). the mechanism of 5lox inhibition
involves reduction of the iron center in lox by the catechol
functionality of  xxxd2748xxx  (kemal et al. 1987; whitman et al.
2002). the curry spice component curcumin (turmeric),
which is structurally similar to  xxxd2748xxx  (fig. 1), also inhibits
5lox, although less effectively (skrzypczak-jankun et al.
2000).
the  xxxg2296xxx -antagonizing effects of  xxxd2748xxx  and curcumin
may not result solely from their ability to inhibit 5lox. both
compounds probably inhibit certain tyrosine kinases independently of lox action. for instance  xxxd2748xxx  has been

reported to antagonize autophosphorylation of the plateletderived growth factor receptor (domin et al. 1994) and we
have observed similar effects of  xxxd2748xxx  on epidermal growth
factor receptor activation. moreover, tetra-o-methyl- xxxd2748xxx ,
which does not inhibit 5lox (whitman et al. 2002), exhibits
respectable  xxxg2296xxx -antagonizing ability (table 1). 5lox is a
cytosolic enzyme that translocates to the nucleus after
phosphorylation via the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
pathway (werz et al. 2000; bigby 2002) (fig. 7) which,
notably, is activated in sod1 mutant mice (kriz et al. 2002).
in the nucleus, 5lox is presented with  xxxd208xxx  by
the 5lox-associated protein (flap) (bigby 2002; helgadottir et al. 2004). the resulting metabolite ltb4 is a natural
ligand for peroxisome proliferator activated receptor
( xxxg1805xxx ), which interacts with  xxxg1222xxx  (ap-1) to
drive transcription of certain genes (rizzo and carlo-stella
1996; madamanchi et al. 1998; funk 2001). interestingly,
 xxxd2748xxx  has been shown to bind ap-1 directly and thereby
interfere with dna binding by the transcription complex
(kwon et al. 2001). thus the potency of  xxxd2748xxx  probably
results from multiple actions on 5lox, receptor protein
kinases and speciﬁc transcription factors (fig. 7).
the involvement of lox with neuroinﬂammation in the
g93a-sod1 mouse is substantiated by the ﬁnding that
5lox message and protein levels are increased in degenerating spinal cords. the neurochemical implications of this
observation are unclear, because so little is known about

lox function within the cns. nonetheless, some possible
interpretations may be formulated from existing knowledge
of 5lox function in ﬁbroblasts and macrophages. leukotrienes formed via lox are released during classical inﬂammation, stimulating events such as bronchoconstrictrion
during asthmatic episodes. similar paracrine functions might
be assumed by the leukotrienes near motor neurons. there
might be another role for 5lox metabolites in transducing
signals from  xxxg2296xxx  into the microglial gene expression
machinery, via ltb4 acting through peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptors and ap-1 (rizzo and carlo-stella 1996;
colville-nash et al. 1998; madamanchi et al. 1998; funk
2001). thus 5lox stimulation of transcription probably
requires the independent recruitment of separate pathways,
such as the c-jun amino terminal kinase (jnk)– xxxg1222xxx  axis,
which are known to be activated in response to  xxxg2296xxx 
(reviewed in hallenbeck 2002) (fig. 7). alternatively, leukotrienes might inﬂuence the sensitivity of neurons to
apoptosis-inducing insults, perhaps by stimulating production of reactive oxygen species (ros) at the level of
mitochondria or membrane nadph oxidase (fig. 7). such a
hypothesis is supported by the observation that ltb4
uniquely and autonomously stimulates ros production in
ﬁbroblast cultures, and  xxxg2296xxx  stimulation of the same ros
ﬂux can be blocked by leukotriene receptor antagonists (woo
et al. 2000).
5lox is expressed in neurons, astrocytes and microglia,
and expression increases with age in mammalian brain
(uz et al. 1998; manev et al. 2000). age-related lox
up-regulation might compromise the aging nervous system in

a more general fashion not limited to the pathophysiology of
als. in addition to 5lox, neurons also express several
enzymes that modify or metabolize leukotrienes and some of
these enzymes have been circumstantially associated with
als. a very recent proteomics investigation found that ltb4
12-dehydrogenase (ltb4-12dh) expression is completely
absent in human als neurons and in neuron-like nsc34
cells engineered to express mutant sod1 (allen et al. 2003).
among the 700 proteins surveyed in this study, ltb4-12dh
was the most differentially down-regulated component in
mutant sod1-expressing cells (allen et al. 2003). ltb412dh down-regulation would probably increase ltb4
levels, and further activate pathways dependent upon this
leukotriene.
our ﬁndings suggest new strategies for management of
als symptoms.  xxxg2296xxx  and 5lox are accessible targets for
pharmacological intervention, at least in the context of
systemic inﬂammatory processes such as rheumatoid arthritis
and asthma. anti- xxxg2296xxx  antibodies and soluble tnf receptor
are clinically efﬁcacious for some rheumatoid conditions
(shanahan and st clair 2002) although neither of these
agents has been explored in neurodegenerative diseases.
anti-inﬂammatory cytokines such as  xxxg1161xxx  generally
antagonize  xxxg2296xxx , but are not transcriptionally increased in
the g93a-sod1 mouse model (hensley et al. 2002, 2003).
theoretically, these anti-inﬂammatory cytokines might suppress neuroinﬂammation if a way could be found to increase
their concentration within the cns.
likewise, small molecule inhibitors of  xxxg2296xxx  or lox
currently exist. thalidomide in particular is well known to
inhibit  xxxg2296xxx  expression.  xxxd2748xxx  is not currently approved
for human use, although it is a relatively non-toxic substance
in its pure form (lehman et al. 1951). high-dose (> 2%
dietary)  xxxd2748xxx  causes renal cysts in rats (evan and gardner
1979); however,  xxxd2748xxx  is tolerated by mice and dogs at 1%
of total dietary intake for periods of 6 months to 1 year
(cranston et al. 1947; lehman et al. 1951). caution would
be warranted in the use of  xxxd2748xxx , however, particularly
when considering natural preparations. crude extracts of the
creosote bush have been used as an alternative cancer therapy
for some years, but these preparations can cause severe
hepatotoxicity (sheikh et al. 1997). in our hands, the
cytotoxic principals of chaparral are separable from  xxxd2748xxx 
(data not shown), but have not been explicitly identiﬁed.
curcumin is a major component of the curry spice turmeric
and is currently available for general consumption. unfortunately the oral bioavailabilities of both curcumin (cheng
et al. 2002) and  xxxd2748xxx  (personal observations) are low, but
might be improved by proper formulation.
finally, some lox inhibitors that have been, or are being
developed for the treatment of asthma may be considered for
use in neurological disease. for instance  xxxd3554xxx  (table 1) is
a hydroxyurea derivative of benzo[b]thiophene approved for
management of asthma (dube et al. 1999). further preclin-

142 m. west et al.

ical and basic scientiﬁc research is required to determine
whether these agents might be exploited for clinical beneﬁt in
als and other neurodegenerative conditions.
the eoc-20 microglial screen that resulted in identiﬁcation of  xxxd2748xxx  as a target compound might offer other
compounds for preclinical assessment. a review of the
literature revealed that several compounds included in the
preliminary eoc-20 screen have also been tested in the
g93a-sod1 mouse and found to be effective (summarized
in table 4), including riluzole, a surprisingly effective
inhibitor of pge2 output. other compounds, such as creatine
and co-enzyme q10, were not effective  xxxg2296xxx  antagonists but
have been reported to improve prognosis in the als mouse.
thus microglial bioassays have the potential to identify novel
anti-neuroinﬂammatory compounds, whereas other pharmacological targets such as bioenergetic agents may not be
indexed by such cell culture models.
