abstract: the atypical antipsychotic  xxxd3195xxx  is a phenylindole-derived compound that has
affinity for and functions as an antagonist at a number of receptor systems, including dopamine
d2 receptors, 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c receptors, and alpha-1-noradrenergic receptors. although previous
data suggested that  xxxd3195xxx  was well tolerated and had good efficacy against both positive and
negative symptom clusters, reports of qt prolongation with  xxxd3195xxx  prompted its voluntary
removal from the market in 1998. after further safety analyses, it recently regained approval
and was reintroduced to the european market for the treatment of schizophrenia, where its
role in therapy among available atypicals remains unclear. this article evaluates the preclinical
and clinical data regarding  xxxd3195xxx ’s effectiveness and concludes that  xxxd3195xxx  continues
to demonstrate a number of strengths, including effective management of both positive and
negative symptoms, well-tolerated side effects (including little or no sedation, weight gain, and
extrapyramidal side effects), and a superior procognitive profile that is unique among atypical
antipsychotics. however, minor concerns regarding its sexual side effects and the major consideration of qt prolongation suggest that additional comparative effectiveness studies are needed
to determine the superiority of  xxxd3195xxx  vs other atypical antipsychotics recently introduced.

over the past 60 years, the environment surrounding the treatment of ­schizophrenia
has changed dramatically. historically, the treatment of the disease was managed in
­psychiatric institutions, where individuals were confined for much, if not all, of their lives.
following the introduction of the first antipsychotic medications (eg, ­chlorpromazine,
haloperidol), however, treatment paradigms began to evolve from longer-term, in-patient
treatment toward a system of managed outpatient care that is the current model of treatment regimens. at present, traditional and atypical ­antipsychotics remain the primary
avenue of treatment for the disease and have demonstrated effectiveness in treating
the presentation of both acute psychotic breaks and preventing relapse.1–3 moreover,
atypical antipsychotics have the additional benefit of demonstrating remarkable efficacy
against the negative symptom cluster of schizophrenia.4
however, it is clear that many problems still exist in terms of unmet needs in the
pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia. first, there continues to be a large number of patients who demonstrate a poor response to treatment with antipsychotics.5,6
a second issue associated with the use of these agents is their undesirable sideeffect profiles that may impair both quality of life (eg, sedation, lethargy, sexual

dysfunction) and physical health (eg, weight gain, obesity,
hypertension).7 a third arena of concern is the not infrequent
development of extrapyramidal side effects (eps), such
as dystonia, ­parkinsonism, and tardive dyskinesia, which
occur more commonly after chronic treatment with traditional ­antipsychotic medications. in fact, tardive dyskinesia
occurs in about one-fifth of patients with schizophrenia who
are prescribed chronic regimens of first-generation agents8
and is often associated with social stigmatization. thus, the
well-established, problematic side-effect profiles of both traditional and atypical antipsychotics make balancing the treatment of the disease against other negative health concerns,
such as sedation, weight gain,9,10 metabolic disorders,11,12 and
prolactin elevation,13,14 challenging at best.
recently, it has become evident that the long-term
treatment of schizophrenia is compounded by significant
impairment in cognitive domains. although this would
seem to be a more recent observation, even kraepelin’s
initial characterization of schizophrenia from over a century ago included descriptions of cognitive deficits,15 and
these ­perspectives have gained greater attention in the more
recent treatment literature.16,17 cognitive deficits observed
in patients with schizophrenia appear widespread and are
related to executive function, working memory, and attention.
these cognitive deficits are present at the onset of illness,
persist for most of patients’ lives without remission, and may
precede the development of positive symptoms.18,19 unlike
psychotic symptoms, cognitive deficits demonstrate a robust
inverse association with community functioning and illness
outcome.20–22 therefore, treatments that attenuate cognitive
deficits have the potential to significantly improve patients’
quality of life.
conventional antipsychotic treatments (eg, haloperidol)
are reported not only to lack effect on cognitive deficits23
but also to impair some cognitive functions. 24,25 novel
antipsychotic compounds (second-generation or “­atypical”
antipsychotics), such as clozapine, 26 olanzapine, 27 and
 xxxd3195xxx ,28,29 have demonstrated some beneficial effects on
negative symptoms and reduced potential to produce eps,
but these agents have demonstrated inconsistent effects on
cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia. depending
on the type of cognitive domain measured, second-generation
atypical antipsychotics have been reported to produce
improvement,23,30,31 no effect,30,32 and impairment.33 thus,
finding effective treatments that manage both positive and
negative symptoms while also having the capacity to address
cognitive dysfunction would seem to be the key.

a final aspect for consideration in the management of
schizophrenia is the total costs incurred due to disease.
certainly, schizophrenia places a heavy burden on society
because of the large demand on the health care infrastructure
but just as important is the burden placed on families and
caretakers. schizophrenia, long considered the most chronic,
debilitating, and costly mental illness, now consumes a total
of about us$63 billion a year for direct treatment, societal,
and family costs.34 schizophrenia accounts for a fourth of all
mental health costs and takes up 1 in 3 psychiatric hospital
beds.34 to the effect that only 10%–15% of people with
schizophrenia are able to maintain full-time employment
of any type,34 public assistance assumes the cost of living.
in 2002, the total direct nonhealth care excess costs in the
united states, including living cost offsets, were estimated
to be us$7.6 billion with indirect excess costs (primarily due
to un- and under-employment) of us$32.4 billion.34 thus,
schizophrenia is a debilitating illness resulting in significant
costs that must be considered in a discussion of emerging
treatments.

risks and benefits in use
of  xxxd3195xxx 
 xxxd3195xxx , manufactured by h lundbeck a/s (copenhagen, denmark), is an atypical antipsychotic that has proven
clinical efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia psychosis
and also improves negative symptoms without producing
eps, when compared with traditional antipsychotics.35,36
previous work has demonstrated that striatal d2 occupancy
is a predictive measure of antipsychotic clinical efficacy37,38
and also suggests that antipsychotic efficacy is not associated with a high degree of striatal  xxxg656xxx  occupancy in
schizophrenia.39
after introduction of  xxxd3195xxx  to the european market
in 1996, concerns regarding an association with prolonged
qt intervals, possibly related to fatal ventricular arrhythmias
including torsade de pointes (tdp), led to its voluntary
withdrawal from the market in december 1998. because of
these apparent risks, a number of studies were undertaken
to investigate sudden death claims related to  xxxd3195xxx , yet
none of the studies thus far have been able to confirm that
 xxxd3195xxx  conveys an increased risk of sudden death.40–44 as
such,  xxxd3195xxx  was re-released and was made available in
the european market for prescriptions beginning in 2006 with
the stipulation of close electrocardiogram (ecg) screening
and monitoring. further studies have shown that  xxxd3195xxx 
has a low arrhythmogenic potential and is not associated

pharmacology, mode of action, and
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3195xxx 
 xxxd3195xxx  is phenylindole-derived compound that is classified as a second-generation, or atypical, antipsychotic
medication. it has affinity for and functions as an antagonist
at a number of receptor systems, including dopamine d2
receptors, 5-ht2 receptors (particularly 2a and 2c subtypes), and alpha-1-noradrenergic receptors.45 antagonism of
these receptor systems are hypothesized to be involved in the
antipsychotic effectiveness.46 like other atypicals,  xxxd3195xxx 
has selective effects on the dopaminergic system, affecting
the mesocorticolimbic rather than mesostriatal neurons.45,47
previous data have implicated a number of atypical antipsychotics, including risperidone,  xxxd3195xxx , and ziprazidone,
in qt prolongation.48–50 an extended discussion of  xxxd3195xxx 
clinical pharmacokinetics is beyond the scope of this review
(for a review of antipsychotic clinical pharmacokinetics,
see mauri et al51), but we will briefly address the issues of
arrhythmias and metabolism/pharmacokinetics.
when concern was raised over the potential for  xxxd3195xxx 
to provoke fatal arrhythmias, the cardiac effects of  xxxd3195xxx 
were investigated in several preclinical and clinical studies.52–54
most antipsychotic agents have been demonstrated to show
electrophysiological effects resembling those of antiarrhythmic agents, and indeed may be responsible for qt-interval
prolongation.55  xxxd3195xxx  was ranked as the new atypical agent
having the greatest risk of producing qt-­interval prolongation,
followed by ziprasidone and risperidone (both producing moderate risk) with the atypical compounds clozapine, olanzapine,
and quetiapine deemed to have no effects on qt intervals.56 in
healthy dogs,  xxxd3195xxx  exposure was not associated with the
development of tdp, but in dogs with chronic atrioventricular
block, high intravenous doses of  xxxd3195xxx  were able to induce
tdp.57 the proarrhythmic effect of  xxxd3195xxx  was subsequently
compared with sotalol, a class iii antiarrhythmic with inhibitory
effects on potassium ion channels and beta-adrenergic receptors.58
the qtc effects of sotalol and  xxxd3195xxx  were comparable, but
at low potassium levels sotalol elicited tdp, whereas  xxxd3195xxx 
only elicited monomorphic tachycardia and nonsustained
polymorphic tachycardia. this difference has been attributed
to  xxxd3195xxx ’s concurrent inhibitory effects on sodium and calcium influx channels,59 as well as to its alpha-1-adrenoceptor blockade, whereby a reflex sinus tachycardia may protect against the
development of tdp specifically.  xxxd3195xxx  also has a low ratio

neuropsychiatric disease and treatment 2010:6

 xxxd3195xxx  and schizophrenia

of myocardium/plasma distribution; thus, this limited distribution to the myocardium may decrease the effective concentration
at rapid delayed rectifier k+ channels (ikr sites).60
excessive weight gain is a common side effect of some,
but not all, typical and atypical antipsychotic medications,
with clozapine and olanzapine being the antipsychotic medications with the greatest likelihood of inducing weight gain
(for reviews, see baptista et al61 and spina and de leon62).
 xxxd3195xxx  treatment engenders relatively moderate weight gain
that is comparable to risperidone, but greater than ziprazidone,
 xxxd155xxx , haloperidol, fluphenazine,  xxxd2956xxx , and molindone. notably,  xxxd3195xxx  produces less weight gain than many
antipsychotics, including clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine,
zotepine, chlorpromazine, and thioridazine.61 given the various
mechanisms of action for  xxxd3195xxx , any weight gain observed
in patients may result either from increased appetite due to drug
interactions with cholinergic and monoaminergic systems or
perhaps from hyperprolactinemia. in addition, one problematic
issue with the treatment of schizophrenia is that polypharmacy
(or drug “cocktails”) might be used in treatment regimens, and
as such, additive weight gain effects resulting from treatment
with multiple antipsychotics might be observed.
the introduction of the atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia coincided with an increased awareness
of the potential for drug–drug interactions, ­particularly involving the cytochrome p450 (cyp) enzymes. when considering
drug–drug interactions, it is useful to anchor any comparisons
against clozapine, which is often considered the standard of
the atypical agents. clozapine has a rather complex pharmacokinetic profile, with large interpatient variability and
many drug interactions.63 in contrast, olanzapine presents as
a medication with a very low incidence of drug interactions,
largely as a result of requiring exceedingly high inhibition of
cyp450 systems.64 the results of both in vivo65 and in vitro66
experiments suggest that the metabolism of  xxxd3195xxx  is principally mediated by cyp3a4 and cyp2d6, and the known
variability of these 2 ­isoenzymes likely contributes to the
observed variability in the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3195xxx .67
in addition, the inhibitory potential of  xxxd3195xxx  at  xxxg582xxx ,68
cyp2d6, and cyp3a469 is relatively modest and not likely
to be of any clinical significance in any patients, except for
those already taking cyp2d6 inhibitors or those who are
poor metabolizers. in contrast,  xxxd3195xxx  was observed to
produce direct inhibitory effects on cyp2b68 and cyp2c6
activities in vitro.70
 xxxd3195xxx  is relatively well absorbed when administered
orally, penetrates the blood–brain barrier well and is largely

bound (99.5%) to plasma proteins. at doses of 4–32 mg/d,
the tmax is 8–12 hours and the terminal elimination half-life
ranges from 50 to 111 hours.67 the mean elimination half-life
of  xxxd3195xxx  is about 70 ± 60 hours, with an oral clearance
of 40 ± 31 l/h.71 the mean cmax of  xxxd3195xxx  was 2 ng/ml
after the first dose and 10 ng/ml after the seventh dose.72
given these data, it is not surprising that significant  xxxd3195xxx 
accumulation can occur during multiple dosing. dosing with
12 mg/d and 20 mg/d can produce steady-state levels after
about 9 and 5 days, respectively.71
 xxxd3195xxx  is metabolized into major (lu 30-131,
5-hydroxy- xxxd3195xxx ; lu 30-148, 4-hydroxy- xxxd3195xxx ) and
minor (lu-25-073, norsertindole; lu 28-092 dehydrosertindole; lu 30-131, 5-hydroxy- xxxd3195xxx ) metabolites,73 and
none of these metabolites are reported to demonstrate any
therapeutic effect. moreover,  xxxd3195xxx  pharmacokinetics
do not seem to be significantly affected by age, sex, or race/
ethnicity.74 because of metabolism pathway considerations,
concurrent administration of cyp inhibitors, such as fluoxetine or paroxetine, is cautioned as these will likely increase
plasma  xxxd3195xxx  concentrations, whereas cyp inducers,
such as carbamazepine or phenytoin, will decrease them.
additional care is needed when calculating effective doses in
patients with hepatic insufficiency. the pharmacokinetics of
 xxxd3195xxx  are unchanged by renal impairment and deficiency,
thus no dose adjustment is necessary in subjects diagnosed
with renal insufficiency or in subjects with renal failure
requiring dialysis treatment.73 the main excretion pathway
for  xxxd3195xxx  is via feces and is observed across species.65

efficacy
the therapeutic efficacy of  xxxd3195xxx  in patients with
­schizophrenia has been evaluated in 1 flexible-dose direct comparison with placebo, 3 efficacy comparisons with ­haloperidol,
and 2 randomized controlled trials (rcts) vs risperidone (see
table 1). smaller retrospective and observational reports are
available and will only briefly be noted here.
in a placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of  xxxd3195xxx 
(8, 12, and 20 mg/d) in 153 patients with schizophrenia,
use of  xxxd3195xxx  20 mg/d was associated with significantly
greater improvements from baseline in the clinical global
impression (cgi) scale as well as in the positive and ­negative
syndrome scale (panss) and brief psychiatric rating
scale (bprs) total scores, relative to placebo after 40 days.36
although the 8-mg/d dose was associated with numerically
greater reductions on the panss and bprs total scores,
the difference was not significant. this study, therefore,
­suggested a dose-response relationship between  xxxd3195xxx

and improvement in psychiatric rating scales and established
20 mg/d as an effective, well-tolerated dose.
data from 3 randomized trials suggest that  xxxd3195xxx 
is at least as effective as haloperidol in the treatment of
schizophrenia and may be more effective in treating negative
symptoms specifically. in a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
dose-ranging trial of  xxxd3195xxx  (12, 20, and 24 mg/d) and
haloperidol (4, 8, and 16 mg/d) in 497 hospitalized patients
with schizophrenia, both  xxxd3195xxx  and haloperidol were
associated with significantly greater improvements at all
doses on panss and bprs total scores compared with
placebo.75 a significant reduction was also noted in the cgi
scale relative to placebo with all doses of  xxxd3195xxx  and all but
the 4-mg/d dose of haloperidol. all doses of haloperidol and
only the 20- and 24-mg/d doses of  xxxd3195xxx  were associated with significant reductions in the ­positive syndrome
subscale of the panss. interestingly, only the 20-mg/d
dose of  xxxd3195xxx  was significantly superior to placebo in
improving negative symptoms as measured on the panss
subscale and scale for the assessment of negative symptoms (sans) over the course of the study. in a longer-term,
randomized study of  xxxd3195xxx  (24 mg/d) vs haloperidol
(10 mg/d) in 282 outpatients with schizophrenia,  xxxd3195xxx 
was associated with a significantly greater reduction in the
sans total score from baseline after 2 months of treatment;
however, there was no significant difference between the
2 treatment groups after 12 months.76 in another doubleblind, randomized, dose-ranging study of  xxxd3195xxx  (8, 16,
20, and 24 mg/d) vs haloperidol (10 mg/d) in 617 patients
with schizophrenia,  xxxd3195xxx  (16 mg/d) demonstrated significantly greater improvement on the negative subscale of
the panss compared with haloperidol (10 mg/d).77 increasing the dose of  xxxd3195xxx  to 20–24 mg/d revealed no greater
benefit in terms of either panss total or negative subscale
scores. there were no significant differences between  xxxd3195xxx  (16–24 mg/d) and haloperidol (10 mg/d) on panss
total score improvement.
direct comparisons of  xxxd3195xxx  with second-generation
antipsychotic drugs are lacking and are currently limited
to two 12-week rcts with risperidone, and these analyses
are limited themselves by early study termination upon
­withdrawal of the drug from the market. a randomized,
double-blind study initially revealed superior efficacy of
 xxxd3195xxx  (12–24 mg/d) over risperidone (4–10 mg/d) on
both panss total and negative symptom subscale scores in
186 patients with schizophrenia.29 a subsequent randomized,
double-blind study comparing  xxxd3195xxx  (12–24 mg/d) with
risperidone (6–12 mg/d) in 217 treatment-resistant (defined as

with schizophrenia, however, demonstrated no significant differences in the same efficacy measures from baseline to final

similarly revealed no difference in efficacy between these 2

both real-world and clinical research data support the efficacy
of  xxxd3195xxx  in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia
(and to a lesser extent other psychotic disorders), although
current evidence for its efficacy is limited to comparisons
with placebo, haloperidol, and risperidone.

the association between  xxxd3195xxx  use and qt prolongation
has been demonstrated since its introduction to the european
market, when clinical trials first documented a 20-millisecond
heart rate corrected qt interval increase with  xxxd3195xxx  use.81
shortly thereafter, the proportion of fatal cardiac arrhythmias
and sudden deaths associated with  xxxd3195xxx  (7.5%) were
found to outnumber almost 10-fold those of either risperidone (0.8%) or olanzapine (0.9%) on the adverse drug

physician reports of adverse drug reactions.40 these data
prompted the manufacturer, lundbeck pharmaceuticals, to
withdraw  xxxd3195xxx  voluntarily from the market and conduct
further studies to confirm the adroit data. five subsequent
epidemiological studies taken together established that  xxxd3195xxx  was associated with no greater risk of death or serious
cardiac adverse drug reaction than other second-generation
antipsychotic drugs;40,43,44,82,83 however, adverse drug reactions associated with  xxxd3195xxx  were determined to be more
frequently reported than those of other atypical agents.41
in 2002, the european committee for proprietary
medicinal products decided to reintroduce  xxxd3195xxx  to the
­european market with the stipulation that all sertindoletreated patients were to be included in a postmarketing
surveillance study.84 data from that cohort, the  xxxd3195xxx 
cohort prospective (scop) study, failed to determine any
overall difference in all-cause mortality rates compared
with treatment with risperidone; however, significantly more
patients treated with  xxxd3195xxx  died from an event considered
possibly cardiac (ie, there was no evidence of a noncardiac
cause) than those given risperidone.85 another study conducted under the named patient use program after  xxxd3195xxx ’s
suspension, the  xxxd3195xxx  safety survey, retrospectively
analyzed the serious adverse events (saes) reported among
1,432 patients treated with  xxxd3195xxx  in 11 european countries.86 of the 97 saes identified, 10 had fatal outcomes
(2 suicides, 3 sudden deaths [2 myocardial infarctions and 1
pulmonary embolism], 4 “other” deaths, and 1 unascertained
cause of death). of the 87 remaining nonfatal saes, 24 were
considered cardiac in origin (15 cases of qt prolongation,
4 heart rate anomalies, 3 cardiac failures, 1 abnormal ecg,
and 1 myocardial infarction).
the association between  xxxd3195xxx  and qt prolongation
remains robust, with industry-sponsored retrospective analysis
replicating the increase of 20 ± 26 millisecond in sertindoletreated patients (n = 160) vs a decrease of 5 ± 22 millisecond
among controls (n = 162) (from lundbeck data).87 a smaller,
noncontrolled trial of 21 patients with schizophrenia treated with
an average dose of 14.7 ± 4.6 mg/d of  xxxd3195xxx  found a significant increase in mean qtc interval from 387.7 ± 19.2 millisecond at baseline to 402.8 ± 23.8 millisecond after 6 months.88 of
course,  xxxd3195xxx  is not unique amongst its class in its propensity to prolong the qtc interval; olanzapine (1.7 millisecond at
20 mg/d), risperidone (3.6 millisecond at 16 mg/d), quetiapine
(5.7 millisecond at 750 mg/d), and ziprasidone (15.9 millisecond
at 160 mg/d) have all been documented to lengthen the qtc
interval, albeit not more than the first-generation neuroleptic
thioridazine (30.1 ­millisecond at 300 mg/d).89 independent of its

association with qt prolongation,90,91 however,  xxxd3195xxx  has
also been shown to induce t wave morphologic changes (flatness, asymmetry, or notches) in a majority (26 of 37 patients)
of patients in one study, suggesting that patients predisposed
to arrhythmias or even sudden cardiac death may be missed
if patients are only screened for qt prolongation.92 in summary,  xxxd3195xxx  is associated with a prolongation of the qt
interval that has not been linked to the development of cardiac
arrhythmias, however, further evidence will be helpful in elucidating the impact, if any, of its electrophysiological profile
on cardiac-related mortality.

extrapyramidal symptoms
the reduced incidence of eps associated with second­generation antipsychotic drugs has been attributed to their
limbic preferentiality and decreased striatal dopamine d2
receptor occupancy relative to their typical counterparts.
in following, available data suggest that  xxxd3195xxx  may be
associated with a lower incidence of eps compared with haloperidol and risperidone. in a double-blind, controlled study
of  xxxd3195xxx  vs risperidone, patients treated with  xxxd3195xxx 
(at a mean dose of 16.2 mg/d) experienced numerically fewer
eps-related treatment-emergent adverse events than those
given risperidone (6.6 mg/d; 19% vs 28%).29 more recently,
another double-blind, randomized study ­comparing  xxxd3195xxx 
(12–24 mg/d) with risperidone (6–12 mg/d) revealed a significantly lower incidence of eps among  xxxd3195xxx -treated
patients (20.8% vs 36.2%, p , 0.01).78 unsurprisingly,
 xxxd3195xxx  (24 mg/d) has been associated with a significantly
lower incidence of eps-related adverse events relative to
haloperidol (4–16 mg/d) after 8 weeks of treatment (23.6%
vs 43.7%–55.7%), with rates ­indistinguishable from placebo
(27.4%).75 a long-term efficacy trial of  xxxd3195xxx  similarly
revealed a 17% lower incidence of eps associated with
 xxxd3195xxx  (24 mg/d) compared with haloperidol (10 mg/d).76
importantly, the emergence of eps with  xxxd3195xxx  use does
not appear to be dose-dependent,36 whereas the incidence
of eps with olanzapine and risperidone has been found to
increase with higher doses.54
although the incidence of eps with  xxxd3195xxx  may
appear exceptionally low, there is currently no data comparing the risk of eps between  xxxd3195xxx  and other atypical
antipsychotics with lower dopamine  xxxg656xxx  affinity
than risperidone. in conjunction with its low risk of eps,
however,  xxxd3195xxx  may have a role in treating patients with
­undesirable movement disorders associated with the use of
conventional neuroleptics. in one case series of 4 patients with
tardive dystonia, dyskinesia, or akathisia, switching from a

both placebo-controlled and randomized, controlled comparator trials with  xxxd3195xxx  suggest that it is well tolerated among
patients with schizophrenia. adverse event reporting from
6 trials (see table 2) suggests that  xxxd3195xxx  is most commonly
associated with rhinitis/nasal congestion (15.3%–34.7%),
nausea (11.0%–13.0%), abnormal ejaculation (8.9%–21.8%),
insomnia (9.3%–31.3%), somnolence (8.2%–18.1%), and
headache (5.2%–33.8%). interestingly, the only adverse event
reported in all 6 trials was abnormal ejaculation, including both
decreased ejaculatory volume and absence of ejaculation. the
ejaculatory abnormalities associated with  xxxd3195xxx  use may
stem from its alpha-1-adrenoreceptor antagonist activity,35 which
has been linked to ejaculatory dysfunction with risperidone97
and thioridazine98 use, although this remains speculative.

the prevalence of metabolic syndrome among patients with
schizophrenia now doubles that of the general population,
conferring tremendous risk of diabetes and heart disease most
notably to those treated with second-generation antipsychotic
drugs.95 limiting the risk of metabolic syndrome has accordingly become a priority within both clinical ­practice and drug
development. in a subset of 261 patients with schizophrenia
randomized to receive either  xxxd3195xxx  or risperidone, neither
treatment was associated with an increased risk of metabolic
syndrome from baseline to last assessment, spanning up
to 12 months.96 however, both  xxxd3195xxx  and risperidone
use were associated with an increase in weight (1.8 and
1.7 kg, respectively), waist circumference (1.4 and 1.5 cm,
respectively), and body mass index (0.6 and 0.6 kg/m2,
respectively). placebo-controlled trials have noted similar,
small but significant weight increases with  xxxd3195xxx  vs
placebo use, with weight gain ranging from 2.2 to 3.3 kg
over 40–56 days of treatment.36,75 double-blind trials of
 xxxd3195xxx  vs risperidone also reported a 2.1- to 3.1-kg weight
gain with  xxxd3195xxx , which did not differ significantly from
that of risperidone (1.5–2.5 kg) over 12 weeks.29,78 treatment with  xxxd3195xxx  has also been associated with small
increases in plasma glucose,78,96 total cholesterol,36,78 and
triglycerides,78 although most studies report negative results
on these parameters.

­ verall, however, rates of withdrawal from trials of  xxxd3195xxx 
o
were low, ranging from 0.4% to 12.2% within the 6 trials
included in table 2. limited naturalistic data also indicate
that  xxxd3195xxx  is well tolerated relative to other antipsychotic
agents. in an observational study of 53 outpatients with
­psychotic illness who had switched from either a conventional
or atypical neuroleptic to  xxxd3195xxx , clinicians rated the sideeffect profile of  xxxd3195xxx  as better (71%), comparable (18%),
and worse (7%) than the previous medication.80

cognition
cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia remains one of the
most devastating, functionally impairing aspects of the illness
and as such has been an important target of antipsychotic
drug development recently. the impact of second-generation
antipsychotics on cognitive impairment is quite variable
insofar as these agents have been found both to improve and
to impair it further. one of the most well-studied paradigms
to examine the effect of antipsychotic drugs on cognition
is the water maze test, which depends on the function of
working memory, learning, and attention. two preclinical
studies have demonstrated that  xxxd3195xxx , administered
both acutely and as a 3-week pretreatment, did not impair
performance in the water maze test, whereas both clozapine
and olanzapine were noted to impair performance.99,100 in
another water maze task,  xxxd3195xxx  was similarly found to
reverse phencyclidine (pcp)-induced deficits in learning and
memory 1 day earlier than clozapine or risperidone.101  xxxd3195xxx  furthermore reversed pcp-induced deficits in a measure
of cognitive flexibility similar to modafinil 102 but unlike
both haloperidol and second-generation agents, including
clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine.103 importantly, this
pcp-induced deficit in cognitive flexibility was also reversed
by a  xxxg1119xxx  antagonist while a selective  xxxg1113xxx 
antagonist was without effect, highlighting a receptor profile
factor that distinguishes  xxxd3195xxx  from risperidone. indeed,
other reports from the preclinical literature have identified
 xxxg1119xxx  mechanisms as being a novel target for cognition
impairments associated with schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders.104–107 limited data from preclinical
reports, therefore, suggest that  xxxd3195xxx  may improve cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. moreover, this improvement
may be related to its unique absence of antimuscarinic and
histamine h1 antagonist activity or to its  xxxg1119xxx  antagonist
activity, illuminating new avenues for receptor targeting in
antipsychotic development.
recently, several clinical studies have explored the
potential for  xxxd3195xxx  to ameliorate cognitive deficits in

patients with schizophrenia. in a randomized, double-blind
trial comparing the effects of  xxxd3195xxx  with haloperidol
on cognitive dysfunction in 34 patients with schizophrenia,
 xxxd3195xxx  improved both reaction time and attentional
­set-shifting significantly more than haloperidol (which
notably worsened reaction time) at 4 and 12 weeks,
respectively.108 in a fludeoxyglucose (fdg) pet study
examining prefrontal cortical (pfc) activation in patients
with schizophrenia treated with  xxxd3195xxx , relative glucose
metabolic rate of the dorsolateral pfc in  xxxd3195xxx -treated
patients, compared with untreated patients and haloperidoltreated patients, was found to approach the metabolic rate
of normal controls.109 the ability of  xxxd3195xxx  to improve
cognitive impairment in schizophrenia may accordingly
relate to its selectivity for cortical and limbic structures,
where  xxxg1119xxx  receptor antagonism has been associated with
dopamine release and cognitive enhancement in preclinical
models.105,110

suicide
suicide remains one of the leading causes of death among
patients with schizophrenia, affecting 9%–13% of this
population.111 evidence that clozapine (vs olanzapine) may
improve suicide rates has prompted further research into
elucidating the differential impact of atypical antipsychotics on this phenomenon.112 a subanalysis of the scop study
following 4,905 patients treated with  xxxd3195xxx  (12 mg/d)
and 4,904 patients treated with risperidone (4 mg/d) for up
to 63.5 months revealed a significantly lower incidence of
suicide attempts (p = 0.037; fatal plus nonfatal) among those
treated with  xxxd3195xxx .113 this difference in suicide rates was
most pronounced during the first year of treatment, when
more than 80% of the suicide attempts occurred (p = 0.0058).
although there were fewer completed suicides among patients
treated with  xxxd3195xxx  than with risperidone (0.14 vs 0.26 per
100 patient years of exposure; pye), the difference was not
significant. although limited to one study, these data suggest a
decreased risk of suicide with  xxxd3195xxx  vs risperidone among
patients with schizophrenia, including those with previous
attempts, and support future comparisons in this regard with
other atypical antipsychotic drugs.

patient perspectives: quality of life
schizophrenia is a devastating illness that compromises
familial, social, and occupational aspects of patients’ lives
from an early age. moreover, individual responses to treatment with antipsychotic medications are highly variable
and may further detract from a patient’s quality of life if

symptoms are not adequately treated or if side effects are
intolerable. insofar as nonadherence predicts negative treatment outcomes,114 significant attention is paid to the effects
of antipsychotic medications on quality of life and treatment
adherence. in this regard, a retrospective study of  xxxd3195xxx 
use after discontinuing treatment with another antipsychotic
agent due to either lack of efficacy or adverse events supports improved quality of life with  xxxd3195xxx  treatment.115
the patients were followed as they discontinued 2 antipsychotic agents (periods 1 and 3, the latter lasting 7.1 months)
to undergo treatment with  xxxd3195xxx  2 times over (periods
2 and 4; 8.7 and 6.4 months in duration, respectively). the
average number of hospitalizations arising from worsening
symptoms decreased significantly upon first switching to
 xxxd3195xxx  (from 3.4 to 1 hospitalization), as did the number
of self-harm attempts (from 22.8% to 3.5%). notably, the
number of patients engaged in a stable relationship increased
significantly during both periods of  xxxd3195xxx  treatment
(from 38.6% to 54.4% and then from 45.6% to 57.1%),
while the number of patients employed more than doubled
after switching to  xxxd3195xxx  for the first time (from 14.0% to
31.6%). these findings suggest that patients may experience
improvement in symptoms, as well as in social and occupational functioning, with  xxxd3195xxx  use after discontinuing
another antipsychotic agent that was either ineffective or
associated with intolerable side effects.
in a year-long, double-blind trial of  xxxd3195xxx  (24 mg/d)
vs haloperidol (10 mg/d),  xxxd3195xxx  use was similarly associated with an improvement in quality of life from baseline
as measured by the heinrichs quality of life scale (a semistructured interview), whereas a slight decrease in quality
of life was noted for patients treated with haloperidol.76 in
the same study, the time to psychotic decompensation and
subsequent hospitalization due to patient nonadherence was
significantly longer in the  xxxd3195xxx  group than in the haloperidol group; to this effect, fewer  xxxd3195xxx -treated patients
were hospitalized (2 vs 12) or withdrawn from the study
prematurely secondary to nonadherence (2 vs 13) than those
treated with haloperidol. a case series additionally describes
improvements in emotional reactivity, initiative, and interest
in 1 patient switching from risperidone (on which she had
otherwise done well) and an improvement in positive and
negative symptoms, weight loss, and increased compliance
in another patient switching from olanzapine.116 on the basis
of these reports,  xxxd3195xxx  may represent a potential therapeutic alternative to improve quality of life among patients
with persistent side effects and/or suboptimal efficacy on an
alternative antipsychotic agent.4

neuropsychiatric disease and treatment 2010:6

 xxxd3195xxx  and schizophrenia

conclusions and place in therapy
with all evidence taken together, the role of  xxxd3195xxx  in
a treatment regimen for schizophrenia seems to be a study
in contrasts. on the one hand, there are a number of areas
where the treatment efficacy with  xxxd3195xxx  is clear. first,
those patients who are likely to benefit from  xxxd3195xxx 
include those who have poor control of existing positive
and negative symptoms.  xxxd3195xxx  demonstrated efficacy
advantages compared with risperidone29,115 and haloperidol75 and continued to show improvement in cgi-i scores
over a 12-month period.81 second,  xxxd3195xxx  seems to be
generally well tolerated, with fewer problematic side effects
related to sedation and weight gain. moreover,  xxxd3195xxx  is
one of the few antipsychotics that demonstrates little or no
sedation, daytime drowsiness, or increased sleep time.117
 xxxd3195xxx ’s lack of effect on muscarinic and histamine h1
­receptors118undoubtedly contributes to the lack of sedation,
but it is also important insofar as  xxxd3195xxx  is not associated
with anticholinergic-mediated cognitive impairment77 or
excessive weight gain.29,77,81 third,  xxxd3195xxx  treatment regimens result in placebo-level eps measures, which compares
favorably with even the lowest doses of haloperidol (4 mg/d)
examined,75 thus reinforcing the notion that  xxxd3195xxx  might
prove valuable on more severe, late-occurring movement disorders.93 fourth, and perhaps most importantly,  xxxd3195xxx  is
one of the few atypical antipsychotics that has demonstrated
a reliable and robust improvement in cognitive function in
both preclinical102,103,119 and clinical samples.35 this is perhaps the factor that distinguishes it from most other atypical
antipsychotics.
another factor for consideration is that  xxxd3195xxx  does
display sexual side effects, producing decreased ejaculatory
volume in more than 20% of men.35 that said, other antipsychotics (eg, risperidone, thioridazine) have also been demonstrated to produce sexual side effects,97,98 and the rate of
 xxxd3195xxx  discontinuation because of decreased ejaculatory
volume was only 3%.35 thus, although this effect is notable
given the incidence rate, it does not appear to represent a barrier to treatment, and it is unclear as to whether it constitutes
a problematic side effect at a practical level.
finally, there are 2 main considerations that may limit
utilization of  xxxd3195xxx . first and foremost,  xxxd3195xxx  is
contraindicated for any patients with significant cardiovascular disease or existing qt prolongation issues. one of
the key requirements for the reintroduction of  xxxd3195xxx 
to the european market was mandatory ecg monitoring
both before and during treatment. thus, in a fashion similar
to monitoring clozapine patients for the development of

agranulocytosis, monitoring  xxxd3195xxx  patients may ­represent
an additional treatment burden and concern for both the
patient and the treatment team. moreover, these criteria
likely disproportionately impact older patients, individuals
with comorbid cardiovascular risk factors, and those taking
multiple medications. thus, the pool of patients most likely to
benefit from  xxxd3195xxx  may be smaller than for other atypical
antipsychotics. regardless, thorough screening and continued
monitoring of  xxxd3195xxx  patients are a necessity.
second, there is a paucity of data comparing  xxxd3195xxx  to
a range of other atypical antipsychotics. much of the literature
to this point has drawn mostly favorable comparisons to haloperidol and risperidone, and although the superior efficacy vs
haloperidol is not surprising, the favorable outcomes vs risperidone are very encouraging. however, robust comparison
with other atypicals (eg, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine,
aripiprazole) is warranted. although preclinical and clinical
data collected to date are encouraging (eg,  xxxd3195xxx  appears
to have a superior efficacy profile related to cognition, weight
gain, and panss), it is only with more complete comparative
effectiveness testing vs both placebo and multiple alternative
atypical treatment regimens120 that the true effectiveness of
 xxxd3195xxx  in therapy can be elucidated.
