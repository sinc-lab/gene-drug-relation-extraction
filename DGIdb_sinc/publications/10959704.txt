assay of functional plasminogen in rat plasma applicable to experimental studies of thrombolysis.  an improved sensitive, specific, precise and accurate assay of plasminogen in rat plasma was developed. it is performed in 96-well microtiter plates and can be completed within one hour. the assay is based on activation of plasminogen by human  xxxg1767xxx  (upa) and simultaneous measurement of generated plasmin with the specific plasmin substrate h-d-val-phe-lys-4-nitroanilide (s-2390), using purified native rat plasminogen for calibration. the concentration of s-2390 in the final reaction mixture during the whole reaction period is much greater than the km value (approximately 20 microm) for rat plasmin-cleavage of s-2390 ensuring that hydrolysis of substrate follows zero order kinetics and that the substrate produces a 20-35 fold decrease in rate of inhibition of plasmin by its target inhibitors in plasma. analogous to the human system the target plasma inhibitors of rat plasmin are shown to be plasmin inhibitor and alpha-macroglobulins.  xxxd3410xxx  (0.8 mm) is incorporated in the reaction mixture resulting in a 19-fold increase in the rate of plasminogen activation and presumably an about 50-fold decrease in the rate of inhibition of generated plasmin by plasmin inhibitor. the assay is suitable for accurate measurement of plasminogen in samples obtained from animals containing pharmacological concentrations of upa or  xxxg1766xxx  (tpa) in their plasma when in vitro plasminogen activation is blocked at ph 5 by collecting blood in acidic anticoagulant. judged from in vitro experiments formation of catalytic active plasmin-alpha-macroglobulin complexes during massive activation of plasminogen in vivo does not interfere with the assay.
