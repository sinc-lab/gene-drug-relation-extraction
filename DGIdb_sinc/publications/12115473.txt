abstract: the use of fibrin sealants offers one of the most
physiologically compatible approaches to preventing postoperative adhesions. although a number of fibrin sealant
formulations have been developed, little is known about
how the various components of these preparations affect the
wound-healing process. because one of the key steps in
wound healing is the migration of phagocytic leukocytes,
such as neutrophils, into the site of injury, we performed
studies to characterize systematically the effects of various
fibrin sealant components on neutrophil chemotaxis. using
a transwell chemotaxis assay, we found that increasing fibrin concentration resulted in an inhibition of the ability of
the cells to migrate through the clots in a dose-dependent
manner, and at fibrin clot concentrations >2.0 mg/ml chemotaxis was completely blocked. factor xiii crosslinking of

the clots also had a significant impact on neutrophil chemotaxis, and sealant preparations deficient in factor xiii allowed neutrophil migration at much higher fibrin concentrations. the presence of various other fibrin sealant components such as  xxxg1775xxx  and fibrinolysis inhibitors
(aprotinin and  xxxd3410xxx ) did not have any significant
effects on the ability of neutrophils to migrate through fibrin
clots as compared to control clots without these components.
overall, these studies show that the composition of fibrin
sealant preparations can significantly affect neutrophil migration into the site of injury, which could possibly influence
the wound healing process. © 2002 wiley periodicals, inc.

introduction

and wound healing responses, for example, neutrophils, macrophages, and fibroblasts.6,7
in an effort to prevent postoperative adhesion formation, a variety of approaches have been developed
and studied in experimental and clinical settings.4,8 of
these treatments, the surgical application of fibrin
sealant products to create a barrier that prevents adhesion formation represents one of the most promising approaches.9–11 fibrin sealants are based on the
use of high fibrinogen/fibronectin concentrations and
thrombin potencies to form bioresorbable fibrin clots
that achieve rapid hemostasis at surgical sites. the
application of these products to function as a dense
fibrin barrier over a surgical site offers one of the most
physiologically compatible approaches to preventing
postoperative adhesions.10,12
one of the major considerations in developing fibrin
sealants has been to identify the optimal composition
of a fibrin barrier product so that it can be easily applied and then subsequently lysed and resorbed by the
in vivo fibrinolytic system. clearly, these latter processes involve the action of tissue-associated fibrinolytic enzyme systems as well as phagocytic cells, such
as neutrophils and macrophages.6,13 however, these
same cells can also trigger an ensuing tissue  xxxd2315xxx -

the formation of postoperative adhesions is a major
clinical problem occurring after abdominal surgery
and can result in severe complications, such as bowel
obstruction and infertility.1,2 these adhesions result
from a progression of coagulation, tissue inflammation, granulation, and scar tissue generation at the site
of surgical trauma.3,4 subsequently, physiologic fibrin
clot deposition at the site of injury can act to attach
injured tissues to adjacent tissues. if this fibrin is not
removed through fibrinolytic action, these temporary
adhesions can lead to permanent fibrous adhesions
between tissue surfaces.3,5 this process is due to the
invasion of cells normally involved in inflammatory

matory response against residual fibrin fragments that
are produced when the applied fibrin barrier is not
dissolved completely.14,15 thus, it is important to understand how phagocytic cells interact with the defined homogeneous fibrin clots formed by fibrin sealant products as compared to the complex heterogeneous fibrin-based provisional matrix found at sites of
would healing.
all fibrin sealant (also called fibrin glue or fibrin
adhesive) preparations are composed of fibrinogen
and thrombin; however, different formulations contain varying levels of additional components, such as
factor xiii, aprotinin, and  xxxd3410xxx .9 in addition, different methods of treatment have been used to
inactivate any potential viruses present in the bloodderived components.9 consequently, this variability
in composition and viral-inactivation treatment regimen would suggest that fibrin barriers formed by different formulations might have significant differences
in their biological properties, especially in relation to
their interaction with the host immune system. in the
present studies, we begin to address this important
issue by investigating what effect fibrin clot composition has on neutrophil chemotaxis through clots created with various formulations of fibrin sealant.

ment represents blood from an individual donor rather than
pooled blood.

preparation of fibrin clots
fibrin sealant components were prepared by reconstituting the lyophilized fibrinogen complex and thrombin with
sterile h2o and sterile h2o containing 30 mm cacl2, respectively. these components were then diluted with trisbuffered saline or tris-buffered saline + 30 mm cacl2, respectively, to 2× the final concentration desired for the resulting fibrin clots. clots were formed by pipetting 30 ␮l of
each component directly into falcon transwell inserts (becton dickinson labware, franklin lakes, nj). the inserts
were quickly shaken to mix the reagents, and the clots were
allowed to form at room temperature for 10 min. next, 60 ␮l
of chemotaxis buffer was added to prevent clots from drying
out, and the clots were stored overnight at 4°c.

chemotaxis assay
human neutrophil chemotaxis was measured in falcon
24-well plates containing transwell inserts.17,18 transwell inserts containing 250 ␮l of purified cells (106 cells/ml) were
placed in wells containing buffer (control) or chemoattractant. after incubating the plates for 90 min at 37°c in a
humidified 5% co2 incubator, the transwell inserts were
removed, and the number of migrated cells was determined
using a colorimetric lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) assay
(cytotox 96 non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay; promega,
madison, wi). briefly, migrated cells were lysed with 1%
triton-x 100 for 30 min, and the plates were centrifuged at
250 × g for 12 min. the supernatants were transferred to an
immulon 96-well microtiter plate, the ldh assay reagents
were added, and absorbance was measured at 490 nm using
a thermomax microtiter plate reader (molecular devices,
sunnyvale, ca). the ldh measurements were then converted to absolute cell numbers by comparison of the values
to standard curves created by aliquotting a range of control
cell standards (25, 12.5, 6.25, and 3.125 × 104 cells) into wells
containing no transwell inserts and processing identically to
the sample wells with inserts.

neutrophil isolation
blood was drawn from healthy donors using protocols
approved by our human subjects institutional review
board on 9/16/1999. neutrophils were purified from human blood using dextran sedimentation followed by hypotonic lysis of red blood cells and histopaque 1077 gradient
separation as previously described.16 the purified cells were
resuspended in hbss containing 10 mm hepes and 0.1%
bovine  xxxg124xxx , ph 7.4 (chemotaxis buffer). cell
preparations were routinely >95% pure, as determined by
light microscopy, and >98% viable, as determined by trypan
blue exclusion. in these studies, we analyzed blood from
approximately 20 different donors; however, each experi-

optimization of the chemotaxis assay
the neutrophil chemotaxis assay was first evaluated
using empty transwell inserts without fibrin clot coating to optimize measurement parameters. a number
of assay variables were evaluated, including incubation time, type and concentration of chemotactic
agent, and insert filter pore size (3- vs 8-␮m pore). in
all experiments, the transwell inserts contained 250 ␮l

476

of purified cells (4 × 106 cells/ml). we tested the neutrophil chemoattractant ltb4 over a range of concentrations (10−6–10−9 m). as shown in figure 1, we observed maximal chemotaxis with 10−7 m ltb4. we
also analyzed the number of cells migrating after 2, 4,
and 6 h of incubation time at 37°c in a humidified 5%
co2 incubator. as shown in figure 1, maximal chemotaxis was observed between 2 and 4 h, and extending the incubation time to 6 h did not result in significantly more migrated cells as compared to that at 4 h.

the filter membranes in the transwell inserts are
available in various pore sizes. we investigated what
effect pore size had on chemotaxis by testing transwell
inserts with 3- or 8-␮m pore sizes. as shown in figure
1, cells migrated efficiently through both the 3- and
8-␮m pore size filters; however, we did observe a
slight increase of background migration in the buffer
control wells with the 8-␮m pore size insert. in addition, significantly more cells migrated through the
3-␮m pore size inserts at 2 h as compared to the 8-␮m
pore size inserts. thus, the optimal results were obtained with the 3-␮m pore size inserts, which were
used in all future experiments.

effect of fibrin concentration on neutrophil
migration through fibrin clots

figure 1. characterization of the transwell chemotaxis assay. neutrophil chemotaxis through 3- and 8-␮m pore size
transwell inserts was measured for each of the indicated
incubation times. the number of cells migrated into the
lower chamber containing control buffer (䊐), 10−6 ( ), 10−7
( ), 10−8 (䊏), and 10−9 ( ) m ltb4 was determined using an
ldh assay as described. the results are presented as a percentage of total cells that migrated (mean ± sd; n = 3). representative of 3 independent experiments.

once reliable experimental procedures were developed, as described above, we used these methods to
analyze chemotaxis through fibrin clots. these experiments were performed using fibrin clots prepared by
varying the fibrin concentration in the clot. initially,
we tested fibrin at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml
with thrombin at 5 u/ml and measured the level of
cell migration at 2 and 4 h. although the cells were
still viable (based on controls), we did not observe cell
migration in any of the clot wells compared to blank
insert controls (data not shown). as an explanation,
we considered that possibly the added distance of migrating through the clot might cause the process of
migrating to the lower chamber to take a longer time.
therefore, we extended the incubation time to 6 h to
allow more migration time. we still observed no migration through 5 mg/ml fibrin clots [fig. 2(a)].
based on these results, we hypothesized that the clots
used in these assays may be too dense of a barrier for
neutrophil migration to occur and, therefore, performed experiments to test lower concentrations of
fibrin (0.1 and 1 mg/ml). as shown in figure 2(b–d),
neutrophils were able to migrate efficiently through
clots containing 0.1 or 1 mg/ml fibrin. at 0.1 mg/ml
fibrin, the neutrophils migrated rapidly, achieving
maximal migration levels by 2 h, whereas significant
levels of migration through the 1 mg/ml fibrin clots
occurred somewhere between 4 and 6 h of incubation
time.
based on the observations described above, we
evaluated a dose-range of fibrin concentrations (0 to 2
mg/ml) because anything over 2 mg/ml fibrin
blocked migration completely. as shown in figure 3,
chemotaxis was blocked in a dose-dependent manner
by increasing fibrin concentrations in the clots prepared using a constant thrombin:fibrin ratio of 1 u:1
mg. we concluded that the range from 0.75–1 mg/ml
fibrin was the optimal concentration to use in further

effect of fibrinolytic inhibitors on neutrophil
migration through fibrin clots
protease inhibitors are often included in fibrin sealant preparations to inhibit fibrinolysis and thus increase the stability and longevity of the clot. therefore,
we tested the effects of two commonly used protease
inhibitors,  xxxd3410xxx  and aprotinin. in these experiments, all clots were prepared at a final clot ratio
of 1 mg/ml fibrinogen to 1 u/ml thrombin, and the
chemotactic agent used was ltb4 (10−7 m).  xxxd3410xxx  was added at 75 mm in the initial fibrin
stock solution (100 mg/ml fibrinogen), making the
final  xxxd3410xxx  concentration 0.75 mm in the 1
mg/ml clot. in all experiments, the presence of  xxxd3410xxx  did not appear to alter neutrophil chemotaxis compared to controls (fig. 4). we observed the
same results using 1.25 mg/ml fibrin clots, where the
 xxxd3410xxx  concentration was increased to 0.94

the effect of  xxxg1775xxx  on neutrophil chemotaxis
through fibrin clots.  xxxg1775xxx  concentrations
tested were 10 and 60 ␮g/ml in the fibrin stock solution (100 mg/ml fibrin). thus, for a 1 mg/ml fibrin
clot, the final concentrations were 100 and 600 ng/ml
 xxxg1775xxx , respectively. in all cases, the presence of
 xxxg1775xxx  at these concentrations did not appear to
alter neutrophil chemotaxis as compared to controls
[fig. 4(b)].

was compared to samples containing no protease inhibitor

no added  xxxg1775xxx  (0 ␮g/ml). in both panels, the number of cells migrated into the lower chamber containing 10−7

mm (data not shown). to evaluate the effects of aprotinin, we evaluated neutrophil chemotaxis through
clots prepared with and without aprotinin. we observed normal levels of chemotaxis through fibrin
clots containing aprotinin up to 120 kiu/ml in the
final clot, indicating that the presence of aprotinin also
did not alter neutrophil chemotaxis [fig. 4(a) shows
the results for 30 kiu/ml]. thus, the presence of protease inhibitors in the fibrin sealant preparations did
not seem to alter the neutrophil chemotactic response.
effect of  xxxg1775xxx  on neutrophil migration
through fibrin clots
varying levels of  xxxg1775xxx  are present in different fibrin sealant preparations. therefore, we tested

factor xiii is a common constituent of fibrin sealant
preparations. to evaluate the effects of this component, we compared fibrin sealant preparations containing factor xiii to factor xiii-deficient preparations. the factor xiii concentrations in these two
preparations were 18 and <0.2 u/ml, respectively,
when measured in the initial reconstituted preparations. as shown in figure 5, clots prepared with factor
xiii-deficient fibrin preparations permitted a significantly higher level of neutrophil migration (p < 0.05)
over all concentrations, as compared to fibrin preparations containing factor xiii. these results were not a
result of differences in fibrin concentration between
the two preparations because protein assays verified
the two initial fibrin preparations contained similar
protein concentrations (normal was 57.9 mg/ml and

factor xiii-deficient was 61.3 mg/ml). furthermore,
when factor xiii was added back to the factor xiiideficient fibrin sealant, the barrier properties of the
fibrin sealant toward neutrophil migration were restored (fig. 5). thus, the presence of factor xiii plays
a major role in modulating neutrophil migration
through the clot.

discussion
fibrin sealants mimic the final step of the coagulation cascade and, therefore, represent the one of the
most physiological hemostatic agents available. the
usefulness of fibrin sealants has been demonstrated
experimentally in animal models19–22 and in human
subjects.23–26 in addition, fibrin sealants are used
extensively for a number of clinical indications, including hemostasis, wound sealing, and surgical gluing.9,10,27,28 with modern advances in viral inactivation technology10 to insure safety and further development of fibrin sealant formulations, commercially
available fibrin sealant preparations are being investigated for additional clinical indications, including
wound healing and as delivery vehicles for drug and
growth factor therapeutics.29 depending on the preparation procedure, fibrin sealant preparations are composed of various amounts of fibrinogen, fibronectin,
 xxxg1775xxx , factor xiii, antifibrinolytic agents, and
thrombin.10 because of these differences between fibrin sealant preparations, we felt it was important to
begin to characterize how differences in component
composition and of the resulting fibrin clots affect the
in situ biological activities. a more complete understanding of these parameters will likely help in the
evolution of newer formulations and advance the development of this technology.
the function of the inflammatory response is to remove both pathogenic agents as well as the byproducts of tissue injury (i.e., clot, scar tissue, etc.). thus, it
is expected that inflammatory cells would be recruited
to sites of clot formation by chemotactic agents produced by the clot itself. indeed, fibrin-derived peptides have been shown to act as chemotactic agents in
vitro30–32 and in vivo,31 and neutrophils have been
shown to have specific receptors for clot constituents.33,34 fibrin peptides have also been shown to
stimulate other leukocyte functions, such as degranulation.15 the recruited inflammatory cells are then responsible for contributing to clot digestion and removal via release of specific leukocyte products, such
as lysosomal enzymes,35 elastase,36 and other proteases.37 thus, a balance between fibrin sealant mechanical strength 38 and suitable interaction with
phagocytic cells should be considered when developing fibrin sealant preparations.

479

the optimal composition of a fibrin sealant product
that can be applied easily and then subsequently lysed
and resorbed in the presence of inflammatory cells is
not well established. it is clear, however, that interaction of phagocytic cells with the fibrin clot affects the
removal of the clot and associated healing of the
wound.39,40 thus, it is essential to understand how
inflammatory cells interact with fibrin sealant products. in the present studies, we evaluated various fibrin sealant constituents for their effects on neutrophil
chemotaxis through fibrin clots. our studies show that
the presence or absence of  xxxg1775xxx  and fibrinolytic inhibitors had no significant effect on the ability
of neutrophils to migrate through fibrin clots as compared to clots without these components. in contrast,
we found that increasing fibrin concentration resulted
in an inhibition of the ability of the cells to migrate
through the clots in a dose-dependent manner. these
findings are similar to those of ciano and coworkers,41
who showed that guinea pig macrophage migration in
fibrin gels depends on fibrin concentration. it is interesting, however, that human neutrophil migration, as
shown here, was stopped at fibrin concentrations >2
mg/ml, whereas macrophage migration only began
to be inhibited at 3 mg/ml and was not completely
stopped until 5 mg/ml, suggesting differences in the
ability of neutrophil and macrophages to migrate
through fibrin clots. because these previous studies
used guinea pig macrophages, it is also possible that
the differences may reflect species-specific differences
in leukocyte migration through fibrin clots.
although factor xiii plays an important role in the
natural clotting process (reviewed in reference 42), its
requirement in the formation of exogenous clots produced with fibrin sealant preparations is not clear. depending on the fibrin sealant formulation used, factor
xiii may or may not be present. in the present studies,
we showed that the presence of factor xiii plays an
important role in the relative barrier that the clot
forms toward neutrophil migration. in factor xiiideficient fibrin sealant preparations, neutrophil migration was not blocked until higher fibrin concentrations (up to 8 mg/ml fibrin), whereas fibrin sealant
containing factor xiii blocked neutrophil migration at
∼2 mg/ml fibrin. in addition, adding exogenous factor xiii back to the deficient preparations restored
their ability to block chemotaxis. overall, it is clear
that the presence of factor xiii ultimately affects the
ability of the clot to act as a leukocyte barrier. consistent with this conclusion, lanir et al.43 previously
found that fibrin matrices prepared with fibrinogen
depleted of factor xiii also supported a much higher
level of guinea pig macrophage migration.
the use of antifibrinolytic agents, such as  xxxd3410xxx  or aprotinin, in fibrin sealants remains controversial.29,44 these agents have been shown to slow
fibrin sealant lysis45; however, clinical evidence of

480

their importance is lacking. in a prospective study,
rakocz et al.46 reported that use of high concentrations
of aprotinin in fibrin sealant and additional local use
of  xxxd3410xxx  resulted in the prevention of late
bleeding after tooth extraction in hemophiliacs. thus,
under special circumstances, these agents may contribute important features, such as long-term stability,
to the fibrin sealant. on the other hand, it has been
reported that aprotinin can cause an allergic reaction
in some patients44 and that  xxxd3410xxx  can cause
seizures when used in the central nervous system.29,47
in the present studies, we showed that the presence or
absence of either  xxxd3410xxx  or aprotinin had no
effect of neutrophil chemotaxis through clots produced with fibrin sealants containing these agents.
one possibility, however, is that inclusion of these
agents in fibrin sealants prepared with very high fibrin concentrations would result in a clot that was
impenetrable to neutrophils for a significantly extended period of time, which might extend the time of
the inflammatory process.
fibrin sealants have played and will continue to
play an important role in controlling postoperative
adhesion formation. in addition, these sealants have
important applications for patients susceptible to
bleeding, for example, hemophiliacs and patients taking anticoagulants. thus, characterization of the composition and biological effects of fibrin sealants is essential for the continued development and improvement of this medically important product. in the
present work, we characterized the effects of various
fibrin sealant components on neutrophil chemotaxis.
these studies show that the composition of the fibrin
sealant preparation can significantly affect neutrophil
migration. these studies may also contribute information useful to fibrin sealant development in the future.
