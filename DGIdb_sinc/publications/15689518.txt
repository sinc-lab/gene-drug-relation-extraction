abstract
l- xxxg2043xxx  (sdh), a member of the ␤-family of  xxxd3047xxx -dependent (plp) enzymes,
catalyzes the deamination of l-serine and  xxxd3361xxx  to yield pyruvate or 2- xxxd64xxx . the crystal
structure of l- xxxg2043xxx  from human liver (hsdh) has been solved at 2.5 å-resolution by molecular replacement. the structure is a homodimer and reveals a fold typical for ␤-family plp-dependent
enzymes. each monomer serves as an active unit and is subdivided into two distinct domains: a small
domain and a plp-binding domain that covalently anchors the cofactor. both domains show the typical open
␣/␤ architecture of plp enzymes. comparison with the rsdh-(plp-oms) holo-enzyme reveals a large
structural difference in active sites caused by the artifical o-methylserine. furthermore, the activity of
hsdh-plp was assayed and it proved to show catalytic activity. that suggests that the structure of
hsdh-plp is the first structure of the active natural holo-sdh.

tion of  xxxd3361xxx  and l-serine by the same mechanism
and, therefore, is thought to be similar to sdh.
sdh is widely distributed in nature, but its physicochemical properties are considerably different from species to
species. for example, rat liver  xxxg2043xxx  (rsdh) is
a dimer (xue et al. 1999; ogawa et al. 2002), whereas yeast
and escherichia coli biosynthetic threonine dehydratase
(etdh), the first enzyme in the isoleucine synthesis pathway, is a tetramer and is feedback-inhibited by isoleucine
and heterotropically activated by valine. e. coli biodegradative threonine dehydratase (d-etdh) induced anaerobically in tryptone-yeast extract medium is a tetramer and is
allosterically activated by amp (madison and thompson
1976). however, e. coli d-sdh is a monomer (marceau et
al. 1988b). on the other hand, the sequence alignment of
sdhs shows only moderate sequence homology.
in spite of the great variety in primary and quaternary
structures of sdhs, two conserved sequence motifs have
been identified. one is ser-xaa-lys-ile-arg-gly, which is
well conserved among sdhs from human (ogawa et al.
1989a), rat (ogawa et al. 1989b), tomato (samach et al.

(plp-oms) have been determined (yoshida and kikuchi
1969). although human sdh shares a high sequence identity of 82% with rat sdh, the comparison with the rat sdh
apo- and holo-enzymes reveals interesting structural differences. in particular, comparison with the rsdh-(plp-oms)
holo-enzyme reveals a large structural difference in active
sites caused by the artifical o-methylserine. furthermore,
the activity of hsdh-plp was assayed and it proved to
show catalytic activity. that suggests that hsdh-plp is the
first structure of the active natural holo-sdh.

1991), e. coli (datta et al. 1987; eisenstein et al. 1995), and
yeast (john 1995). the lysine in rat liver sdh has been
identified as the residue that forms a schiff base with plp.
the active sites are highly homologous with those of the
microbial threonine dehydratases, such as yeast and e. coli
tdh. moreover, these enzymes have a glycine-rich sequence in a region 100–130 amino acid residues downstream of the plp binding lysyl residue (datta et al. 1987).
the importance of this motif in the interaction with the
coenzyme was first assessed by the finding that substitution
of the glycine residues with  xxxd233xxx  residues impairs
plp binding to e. coli d-sdh (marceau et al. 1988a) and
further demonstrated by the crystal structure of e. coli tdh
(gallagher et al. 1998).
in mammals sdh is found predominantly in the liver.
extensive studies have been carried out on sdh from rat
and the enzyme has been found to play an important role in
gluconeogenesis since its activity is remarkably induced by
the consumption of high-protein diets, starvation, and other
conditions (snell 1984; ebara et al. 2001). little is known
about the physicochemical and enzymatic properties of human sdh because human livers exhibit low sdh activity
(yoshida and kikuchi 1969). however, some important
functions have been found. it has been reported that a case
of nonketotic hyperglycinemia was apparently due to hereditary deficiency of threonine dehydratase (krieger and
booth 1984). in addition, the  xxxg2043xxx  activities
were absent in human colon carcinoma and rat sarcoma
(snell et al. 1988). as a result, sdh is thought to be related
to nonketotic hyperglycinemia and tumors. this prompted
us to examine the properties of human sdh.
here we report the crystal structure of recombinant human liver sdh holo-enzyme with bound plp cofactor, or
sdh-plp. the structure is a homodimer and reveals a fold
typical for ␤-class plp-dependent enzymes. the active-site
residues can be readily correlated with the predictions based
on the results of biochemical and mutagenesis studies of rat
sdh. recently the structures of the rat liver sdh apoenzyme and a holo-enzyme with o-methyl serine, sdh792

the current monomer model of hsdh comprises 319 (4–
322) residues, 1 plp molecule, and 131 water molecules.
the n-terminal three residues and the c-terminal six residues were not visible in the electron density map and, consequently, were not included in the final model. most of the
319 residues were clearly defined. during the refinement,
the r-factor dropped from 45.8% to 18.9%, while the free
r-factor decreased continuously from 52.8% to 24.7%. stereochemistry is good with 93.7% of residues in the most
favored region of the ramachandran plot (table 1). a further 6.3% of residues lie in additionally allowed regions,
and there are no residues in the generously allowed or disallowed regions. the overall fold of the monomer is very
similar to that of other plp-dependent enzymes of the
␤-family (fig. 2). briefly, the hsdh monomer consists of
two domains: a small domain consisting of residues 42–137,
and a large domain consisting of residues 1–41 and 138–
322. the large domain is also referred to as the catalytic
domain since it contains the essential plp cofactor. the
secondary structure of the hsdh monomer as defined by the
program dssp (kabsch and sander 1983) is shown in figure 4, below. the small domain folds as a twisted ␣/␤ structure
consisting of a central four-stranded (␤3–6) parallel ␤-sheet
and four surrounding helices (helices 3–6). the plp-binding domain contains 10 ␣-helices (helices 1 and 7–15), one
310-helix 2, and six ␤-strands (␤1, ␤2, and ␤7–10). the core
of this domain is an open twisted ␣/␤ structure with a central ␤-sheet surrounded by seven helices (helices 7–11 and
13–14), similar to the small domain. the central ␤-sheet is
basically parallel, but one n-terminal short strand, strand 1,
is antiparallel. these strands are strongly twisted so as to
make the sixth strand nearly perpendicular to the first. there
is a crevice at the carboxyl ends of the ␤-strands 7 and 10,
which makes a space for bound plp. except for strand 1, all
␤-strands of the two domains are directed toward the molecular center, and all ␣-helices have a chain direction toward the molecular surface. the 310-helix 2 at the n terminus consists of three residues. the 310-helix of hsdh is at
the interface region between the two domains. the two

domains are connected by two linkers (residues 32–35 and
138–146). between the domains, there is a large internal
gap that includes the crevice mentioned above. this large
internal gap provides a space for the active site.
dimer structure
two monomers of hsdh interact with each other, forming
a dimer with a dyad axis running through the interacting
surfaces (fig. 2). the interface between the two monomers
is formed through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. the accessible surface area buried between the two
monomers is 5.7% of the total molecular accessible surface.
the monomer–monomer contacts involve six pairs of hydrogen bonds formed between 10 residues (arg98-asn260,
leu310-asn260, and leu265-lys263 and their dyad symmetry mates). additional interactions include a number of
hydrophobic contacts. the residues met17, lys21, asn101,
glu102, ser306, ile308, ser309, and ile264 in each monomer form a hydrophobic surface. most of the residues involved in the contacts are located on helices ␣2, ␣5, ␣11,
␣14 and a loop of each monomer.

cofactor binding site
typical of open twisted ␣/␤ structures, the plp cofactor is
positioned at a crevice between the ␤-strands (␤7 and ␤10)
of the plp-binding domain and lies on the large internal gap
between the two domains (fig. 3). the plp cofactor is
covalently bound through a schiff base linkage to nz of
lys41 with c4⬘ (the internal aldimine). the cofactor is
sandwiched between the side chain of phe40 and the main
chain of ala222. each of the polar substituents of plp is
coordinated by an appropriate functional group: the pyridinium nitrogen is hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of
cys303, the c3-hydroxyl group is hydrogen-bonded to the
side chain of asn67, and the phosphate group of plp is
coordinated by main chain amides from the tetraglycine
loop (residues 168–171).
comparison with other serine/threonine dehydratases
sdh is widely distributed throughout nature, but its physicochemical properties vary considerably from species to
species. it is of particular interest that the quaternary structures of all the known sdhs of various organisms can be
classified into three types: monomer (d-sdh), dimer
(hsdh, rsdh), or tetramer (etdh, d-etdh). furthermore,
the sequence similarity among the three types is relatively
low and there is wide variation in their molecular masses.
sequence alignment between sdh and tdh shows that two
regions are conserved in both types of enzymes: the sequences around the lysyl residue forming a schiff base with
plp and the glycine-rich sequence which is considered to
interact with the phosphate moiety of plp (fig. 4). since all
sdhs have a similar catalytic activity, it is expected that the
active sites and catalytic mechanism are similar as well.
the structure of the rat sdh (rsdh) apo-enzyme has
recently been determined to 2.8 å (pdb id 1pwe), and a
holo-enzyme form of rsdh with o-methylserine has also
been determined to 2.6 å (pdb id 1pwh) (yamada et al.
2003). human sdh shares a high sequence identity of 82%
with rat sdh (fig. 4). while hsdh and rsdh share the

same overall fold, a large conformational change in the
region 197–228 is observed. superposition of hsdh with
the rsdh apo-enzyme shows an r.m.s. deviation (r.m.s.d.)
of 0.97 å if residues 197–228 are excluded. the large conformation change of residues 197–228 in the rsdh apoenzyme has been attributed to the lack of plp and k+ ion in
the active site of the apo-enzyme. consequently, in the
rsdh apo-enzyme dimer structure, residues 197–228 are
stabilized by residues 105–124 of the partner subunit.
the hsdh holo-enzyme has a different dimeric form to
the rsdh apo-enzyme, but has the same dimeric form as the
rsdh-(plp-oms) holo-enzyme. the hsdh and rsdh
holo-enzymes can be superimposed with an r.m.s.d. of 1.50
å for all c␣ atoms. comparison of the superimposed structures shows that residues 197–228 adopt a similar conformation in both structures (fig. 5a). however, interesting
794

differences are observed between our hsdh-plp holo-enzyme structure and the rsdh-(plp-oms) holo-enzyme
(fig. 5b). first, while the hydrogen-bonding of the plp
cofactor is preserved in the two holo-enzymes, the plp
cofactor in the hsdh holo-enzyme is tilted by approximately 5° toward lys41 relative to rsdh. second, a hydrogen bond is made in the rsdh holo-enzyme between the
o-methylserine and ser64 o␥. the formation of a hydrogen
bond by the o-methylserine effectively pulls strand ␤3, on
which ser64 is located, toward itself. the ␤3 strand forms
part of a small four stranded ␤-sheet covering residues 65–
130. consequently, there is a large cooperative movement
of residues 65–130 in the small domain of the rsdh holoenzyme toward the plp-oms aldimine, thus reducing access to the active site. at its largest, the deviation between
this region of the rsdh holo-enzyme is more than 6 å

relative to the hsdh holo-enzyme. since the presence of
oms in the rsdh holo-enzyme is entirely artificial, we can
conclude that the hsdh structure reported here is the natural sdh holo-enzyme.
the crystal structure of e. coli tdh (etdh) has also
been determined (pdb id 1tdj) (gallagher et al. 1998).
sequence identity between hsdh and etdh is a moderate
25%. although the activity of human sdh is not regulated
by any known effector molecule, the tetrameric e. coli tdh
is subject to allosteric regulation by isoleucine and valine.
to illustrate the main structural differences of various sdhs
and tdhs, a detailed structural comparison was performed
between hsdh and etdh.
each monomer of etdh contains one catalytic domain
(the plp-binding domain) and one regulatory domain. the
structure of hsdh is similar to the catalytic domain of

etdh (fig. 6a). in the etdh structure, plp is accommodated in a pocket where it is maintained in the correct orientation by a number of covalent and noncovalent interactions. figure 6b compares the plp binding sites of etdh
and hsdh. the pocket consists mainly of residues conserved between the two enzymes. the orientation of plp
within hsdh is very similar to that observed in the etdh.
in both cases, the cofactor phosphate group is hydrogenbonded to an invariant tetraglycine loop, gly168–gly171 in
hsdh and gly188–gly191 in etdh. the pyridoxyl ring is
packed between two hydrophobic groups, namely phe40
and ala222, corresponding to phe61 and gly241, respectively. on the other hand, the hydrogen bond that c3-hydroxyl establishes with asn89 in etdh corresponds with
asn67 in hsdh. the main differences between the two
binding sites regard the interactions of the polar moiety of

the plp ring. the nitrogen forms a hydrogen bond with
ser288 in td, whereas it is coordinated by the sulfhydryl of
cys303 in the hsdh.
unlike etdh, hsdh has no regulatory domain. this is
the main difference between the two enzymes. in the absence of this domain, hsdh shows complete catalytic activity but no allosteric regulation. the result is consistent
with the former data that showed the main effect of regulatory domain on allosteric regulation and feedback inhibition (chinchilla et al. 1998). despite low sequence homology, the catalytic domains of the two enzymes are highly
conserved and the same result can be expected among other
sdhs.
from the comparison, we can conclude that despite the
low sequence homology and the striking different quaternary structures of various sdhs, their catalytic active sites
are highly conserved. the result strongly suggests that different sdhs may perform their catalytic activity in the same
way.

firms that recombinant human sdh shows catalytic activity
for l-serine. when potassium phosphate was added to the
standard enzyme assay solution, the rate of reaction was
increased, suggesting that k+ ions might have an important
role in the catalysis of sdh. previous reports have confirmed that the presence of potassium ions affects the enzyme activity of both rat sdh (pestana et al. 1971) and
d-sdh (kojiro et al. 1989).
in many plp-enzymes, monovalent cations such as na+
and k+ are important effectors of catalytic activity (woehl
and dunn 1995b). in these systems, the metal ion cofactor
is classified as an allosteric effector that does not participate
directly in bonding interactions with the reacting substrate.
in tryptophan synthase, for instance, na+ and k+ stabilize
different conformational states of the external aldimines.
they also affect the equilibrium distribution of enzyme–
substrate intermediates in the crystalline state (woehl and
dunn 1995a). as no potassium was added during the purification and crystallization, no k+ ions are found in the
hsdh structure. however, potassium ions have been observed near the phosphate group of plp cofactor of the ␤
subunit in the structures of the rsdh holo-enzyme (yamada
et al. 2003), tryptophan synthase (hyde et al. 1988) and
 xxxg2256xxx  (isupov et al. 1998). the major role of this
ion is to stabilize the framework of the active site and it is
not believed to be directly involved in catalysis.
conclusions
in conclusion, the crystal structure of human sdh confirms
that the enzyme belongs to the ␤-class of pyridoxal 5⬘phosphate (plp) dependent enzymes. human sdh is a
dimer of identical polypeptide chains containing 328 amino
acid residues. the essential plp cofactor is located between
two loops of the catalytic domain and identifies the active
site. comparison with the rat sdh apo- and holo-enzymes
reveals interesting structural differences. in particular, comparison with the rsdh-(plp-oms) holo-enzyme reveals a
large structural difference caused by the artificial o-methylserine. that suggests that the structure of hsdh-plp reported here represents the natural holo-enzyme. on the basis
of the present structure, amino acids implicated in substrate
binding and catalysis can be identified for further site-directed mutagenesis studies. such research will aid the understanding of the catalytic mechanism of action of this
enzyme.

hsdh was crystallized by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion
method. crystals were grown at 291 k using (nh4)2so4 as precipitant. diffraction data was obtained to a resolution of 2.5 å
from a single frozen crystal using cu k␣ radiation. all data were
integrated and scaled using denzo and scalepack
(otwinowski and minor 1997). crystal parameters and data collection-data statistics are summarized in table 1.

ence maps using the program o (jones et al. 1991). the plp
molecule from the etdh structure was manually adjusted and
built into the electron density map. solvent molecules were added
during the final cycles of refinement. the crystallographic free
r-factor was monitored at each stage and a composite omit map
was calculated to eliminate model bias. the quality of the structure
was evaluated using a ramachandran plot calculated by the program procheck (laskowski et al. 1993). statistics on the final
model are presented in table 1.

structure determination
enzyme assay of human sdh
the structure of hsdh was determined by molecular replacement,
employing the monomeric form of etdh (pdb id 1tdj) as a
search model. etdh shares 27% sequence identity with hsdh.
the search model was composed of residues 32–330 of the etdh
structure based on sequence alignments using clustalw
(thompson et al. 1994). rotation and translation searches were
performed using cns (brunger et al. 1998). following rigid body
refinement at 3.0 å, a ␴-weighted map was calculated as a basis
for fitting the model. crystallographic refinement was carried out
with molecular dynamics using the program cns. ten percent
(10%) of the reflection data were set aside for calculation of the
free r-factor. several cycles of simulated annealing at 3000 k,
including minimization and b-factor refinement, were performed.
after each cycle of refinement, manual rebuilding was carried out
with the guidance of ␴-weighted 2|fo| − |fc| and |fo| − |fc| differ-

a direct spectrophotometric assay (freedland and avery 1964)
was used to determine the sdh activity. through a wavelength
scan, we found that pyruvate had a characteristic absorbance at 265
nm but serine and sdh had not. therefore, in the enzyme activity
assay, we monitored the increase in absorbance at 265 nm, which
is associated with the formation of pyruvate. changes in absorbance were recorded by a spectrophotometer. the standard assay
solution contained 990 ␮l of 0.1 m sodium phosphate, physiological ph 7.5, and 10 ␮l purified enzyme; 50 ␮l of 0.5m l-serine
was added to start the reaction. assays were performed at 25°c.
