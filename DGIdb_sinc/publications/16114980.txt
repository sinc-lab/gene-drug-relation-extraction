summary
 xxxd3094xxx  ( xxxd3094xxx ™), a fentanyl derivative, is an ultra-short acting, nonspecific
esterase-metabolised, selective mu-opioid receptor agonist, with a pharmacodynamic profile typical of opioid analgesic agents. notably, the esterase linkage in
 xxxd3094xxx  results in a unique and favourable pharmacokinetic profile for this
class of agent.
adjunctive intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  during general anaesthesia is an effective
and generally well tolerated opioid analgesic in a broad spectrum of patients,
including adults and paediatric patients, undergoing several types of surgical
procedures in both the inpatient and outpatient setting.  xxxd3094xxx  is efficacious
in combination with intravenous or volatile hypnotic agents, with these regimens
generally being at least as effective as fentanyl- or alfentanil-containing regimens
in terms of attenuation of haemodynamic, autonomic and somatic intraoperative
responses, and postoperative recovery parameters. the rapid offset of action and
short context-sensitive half-time of  xxxd3094xxx , irrespective of the duration of the
infusion, makes the drug a valuable opioid analgesic option for use during
balanced general inhalational or total intravenous anaesthesia (tiva) where
rapid, titratable, intense analgesia of variable duration, and a fast and predictable
recovery are required.
pharmacological profile  xxxd3094xxx , a selective mu-opioid receptor agonist, demonstrates typical opioid
agonist effects, including analgesia, respiratory depression and haemodynamic
effects (e.g. decreased heart rate and blood pressure). in terms of analgesic
intensity, the lack of response to surgical incision and management of intraoperative stress,  xxxd3094xxx  exhibited similar potency to fentanyl and appeared to be
16- to 70-fold more potent than alfentanil in adult healthy volunteers and surgical
patients. naloxone, but not norbinaltorphimine, antagonised the effects of
 xxxd3094xxx . in  xxxd3094xxx  recipients, haemodynamic effects were not associated with the release of histamine. the drug has a rapid onset of analgesic action (1
minute) and fast offset of action (3–10 minutes vs 5–20, 20–30 and 180–240
minutes, respectively, with alfentanil, fentanyl and morphine).  xxxd3094xxx 
recipients experienced no clinically relevant effects on intraocular or intracranial
pressure, cerebral blood flow, cerebrovascular carbon dioxide reactivity or cerebral capacity. in association with volatile or intravenous anaesthetic agents,
 xxxd3094xxx  demonstrates typical opioid-induced hypnotic sparing effects. the
primary metabolite of  xxxd3094xxx  (gr90291) exhibits ≈300- to 4600-fold less
activity than the parent compound.
intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  exhibits a linear, dose-dependent pharmacokinetic
profile in surgical patients and in healthy volunteers. the drug is rapidly absorbed
and distributed throughout the body (mean volume of distribution at steady state

[vdss] 260–415 ml/kg) and is ≈70% bound to plasma proteins.  xxxd3094xxx 
rapidly crosses the placental barrier, but is quickly metabolised and/or redistributed in the neonate. the drug readily crosses the blood-brain barrier.
 xxxd3094xxx  is rapidly (mean terminal elimination half-life [t1/2beta] ≈10 minutes)
and extensively metabolised by nonspecific blood and tissue esterases to the
relatively inactive carboxylic acid metabolite gr90291. this metabolite is eliminated mainly (≥88% of the dose) in the urine, with mean t1/2beta values ranging from
88.1 to 137.4 minutes following bolus doses of  xxxd3094xxx  2–30 mug/kg. the
mean clearance (cl) rate of  xxxd3094xxx  exceeded the average hepatic blood flow
by ≈3- to 4-fold. the pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd3094xxx  is unlikely to be
affected by inherited or acquired deficiencies in plasma cholinesterases. the
context-sensitive half-time of  xxxd3094xxx  was independent of the duration of
infusion, unlike that of other mu-opioid receptor agonists.  xxxd3094xxx  recipients
had similar mean vd of the central compartment (vdc) and distribution half-life
values to those of alfentanil recipients; however, the mean cl value was ≈5-fold
greater and the mean t1/2beta was ≈6-fold shorter with  xxxd3094xxx  treatment (no
statistical data reported).
there were no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetic profile of
the drug in those with renal or hepatic impairment, or based on gender. during the
hypothermic phase (core body temperature 28–30°c) of cardiopulmonary bypass,
the mean clearance of  xxxd3094xxx  was reduced by ≈20%. in surgical patients
aged 0 to <18 years, after correction for bodyweight, there were no significant
differences in pharmacokinetic parameters of  xxxd3094xxx  in these recipients
versus those in adults. between the age of 20 and 85 years, vdc and cl values
decrease by ≈25% and 33% in healthy adult volunteers, requiring a 50% reduction
in the initial and subsequent doses of  xxxd3094xxx  in those >65 years of age. these
pharmacokinetic parameters are also reduced by about one-third in obese versus
lean patients; reductions in dose in obese recipients should be based on the
patient’s ideal bodyweight.
therapeutic efficacy

intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  in combination with volatile or intravenous hypnotic
agents provided effective analgesia and attenuated responses to various stimuli
during the induction and/or maintenance of general anaesthesia in a broad
spectrum of surgical patients in several comparative, randomised clinical trials.
as per therapeutic recommendations, bolus doses of  xxxd3094xxx  were typically
0.5–1 mug/kg, with infusion rates of 0.2–0.5 mug/kg/min; higher infusion rates
(1–2 mug/kg/min) were used in patients undergoing ‘fast-track’ coronary artery
bypass graft surgery (cabg).
during induction of anaesthesia in adult patients undergoing various surgical
procedures,  xxxd3094xxx  attenuated the stress response to intubation, and facilitated endotracheal intubation without a muscle relaxant.  xxxd3094xxx  also facilitated laryngeal mask airway insertion during induction of propofol-based tiva. in
morbidly obese patients,  xxxd3094xxx  was as effective as alfentanil or fentanyl in
blunting the haemodynamic response to tracheal intubation using propofol-based
tiva.
in surgical patients,  xxxd3094xxx -containing regimens were generally at least
as effective as fentanyl- and alfentanil-containing regimens during the induction
and/or maintenance of balanced general anaesthesia, as assessed by various

intraoperative responses and postoperative recovery parameters. for instance, in a
large (≈2500 inpatients and outpatients) single-blind trial, relative to fentanyl
recipients,  xxxd3094xxx -treated patients responded to verbal commands faster
(after both inpatient and outpatient surgery) and, after day surgery, recovered
faster and were discharged from hospital sooner. notably, haemodynamic profiles
in response to intraoperative stimuli were generally better and postoperative
functional abilities improved at a faster rate in  xxxd3094xxx  than fentanyl recipients. in a large double-blind trial, significantly fewer  xxxd3094xxx  than alfentanil
recipients responded to intraoperative surgical stimuli (primary endpoint), intubation or skin incision. typically,  xxxd3094xxx  recipients experienced effective
analgesia and attenuation of intraoperative responses irrespective of their age
(including paediatric and elderly patients), bodyweight, the degree of renal or
hepatic impairment, type (e.g. major abdominal surgery, cabg, neurosurgery,
ear, nose and throat, or opthalmic surgery) and duration of surgery being undertaken, whether the drug was combined with intravenous or volatile hypnotic
agents, or whether the drug was used in the inpatient or outpatient setting. limited
data also suggested that intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  was an effective opioid analgesic during caesarean section, with generally no significant difference in apgar or
neurologic and adaptive capacity scores at most timepoints in neonates born to
mothers receiving a  xxxd3094xxx - versus a fentanyl-based anaesthetic regimen in a
small single-blind trial.
tolerability

bolus doses and/or infusions of intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  were generally well
tolerated as a component of induction- and maintenance-regimens for general
anaesthesia in adults and children undergoing surgery. common adverse events
associated with  xxxd3094xxx  treatment during the perioperative period, such as
muscle rigidity (0–8%), bradycardia (2–12%), hypotension (6–30%), nausea
(12–47%), vomiting (3–33%) and shivering (6–26%), are typical of those reported
with all mu-opioid receptor agonists and resolved rapidly upon discontinuation of
the drug or reduction in the infusion rate and/or with appropriate treatment.
the nature of adverse events occurring in  xxxd3094xxx  recipients was generally
similar to that seen in fentanyl recipients, although hypotension occurred significantly more frequently in  xxxd3094xxx  recipients (inpatients [18% vs 7%], outpatients [9% vs 3%]) in a large (n = 2438) single-blind trial. a significantly higher
percentage of  xxxd3094xxx  recipients experienced at least one drug-related adverse
event in the overall population (21% vs 11% of fentanyl recipients) and in
subgroup analyses of inpatients (34% vs 16%) and outpatients (26% vs 9%).
there were no between-group differences in the intensity of these adverse events,
with 3% of patients in each group experiencing at least one severe adverse event.
there was no intergroup difference in the incidence of postoperative nausea in
either patient populations, although postoperative vomiting occurred significantly
more frequently in  xxxd3094xxx  recipients undergoing outpatient surgery (15.5%
vs 12.5%).
there was no between-group difference in the nature of treatment-related
adverse events in  xxxd3094xxx  groups compared with alfentanil groups, although
some individual events occurred with a higher incidence. eighty-two percent of
 xxxd3094xxx  recipients and 75% of alfentanil recipients experienced at least one
adverse event in the largest trial (n = 234), with a significantly higher incidence of

hypotension (30% vs 10% of patients) and bradycardia (10% vs 3%) in the
 xxxd3094xxx  group during the maintenance phase.

1. introduction

2. pharmacodynamic profile

development of new opioid agonists for adjunctive use during the induction and maintenance of
balanced anaesthesia has focused on agents that
provide rapid, intense and titratable analgesia, with a
quick predictable recovery after bolus doses or prolonged infusions and a favourable tolerability profile.[1]  xxxd3094xxx  ( xxxd3094xxx ™)1 (figure 1), a 4-anilidopiperidine derivative of fentanyl that contains an
ester linkage to  xxxd3029xxx , is a highly active,
ultra-short acting, selective, mu-opioid receptor agonist. the presence of an ester linkage provides
 xxxd3094xxx  with a unique pharmacokinetic profile
among this class of agents (section 3), leading to its
rapid metabolism and clearance, thereby preventing
the accumulation of  xxxd3094xxx  even after prolonged use or high doses.[2,3]
the pharmacological profile, therapeutic efficacy
and tolerability of intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  have
already been briefly summarised in drugs.[4] this
article provides a brief overview of the pharmacological profile of the drug, with a more detailed
discussion of its efficacy and tolerability focusing
solely on the use of  xxxd3094xxx  during the induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia. discussion of other uses of  xxxd3094xxx , including as an
adjunct to local and regional anaesthesia and for
postoperative analgesia (reviewed by beers and
camporesi[5]), is beyond the scope of this review.

the selective mu-opioid receptor agonist  xxxd3094xxx , like other agents in this class, produces effects
that are consistent with its activity at this receptor,
such as analgesia and respiratory depression (table
i). these effects are competitively inhibited by
naloxone (a mu-receptor antagonist)[9,38,39] but not by
the kappa-receptor antagonist norbinaltorphimine,[38]
confirming the selectivity of  xxxd3094xxx  for muopioid receptors in healthy adult volunteers and in
vitro and in vivo studies. in adult volunteers and
surgical patients,[6,10,11,29]  xxxd3094xxx  shows similar
potency to fentanyl and appears to be 16–70-fold
more potent than alfentanil, as assessed by analgesic
effects, the lack of response to surgical incision and
the management of intraoperative stress (reviewed
by egan[44,45]). the primary metabolite gr90291
shows relatively limited pharmacological activity
versus  xxxd3094xxx  (table i and section 3).[40,42,44]
 xxxd3094xxx  has a rapid onset and short duration
of action (table i).[10,15,39,41,46] as reviewed by mason,[46] the duration of action of  xxxd3094xxx , alfentanil, fentanyl and morphine was 3–10, 5–20,
20–30 and 180–240 minutes, respectively, in adults.
in a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled
trial, peak analgesic effect after single intravenous
doses of  xxxd3094xxx  or alfentanil occurred at 1- or
3-minute assessment timepoints for both drugs in 48
healthy adult volunteers, with both drugs having a
similar duration of action.[10] the rapid onset of
action is supported by the short latency-to-peak effect (i.e. the t1/2ke0, the parameter used to characterise the delay between peak plasma or blood drug
levels and peak drug effect) after a bolus dose of
 xxxd3094xxx , which was similar to that of alfentanil
in another study of the same design (1.6 vs 0.96
minutes).[15]
 xxxd3094xxx  shows typical opioid-induced effects on haemodynamic responses, such as de-

(pts), and in in vitro[38] and in vivo[39-43] studies. some data are derived from reviews[44-46]
opioid-receptor activity
selective mu-opioid receptor agonist[38,39]
in guinea pig ileum tissue, rem ec50 = 2.4 nmol/l vs 1.8, 20.1 and 0.3 nmol/l with fen, alf and suf, respectively[38]
analgesic effects
in adults,[6,10,11,29] rem shows similar potency to fen and appears to be 16- to 70-fold more potent than alf based on eeg and mac
reduction studies (reviewed by egan[44,45])

haemodynamic/cns effects
in animal models, inhibition of hr, map and myocardial contractility;[39,41,43] typically dose-dependent[39,41,43] (also see section 4 for
discussion in pts)
dose-dependent haemodynamic responses with rem that were similar in nature to those observed with alf, but of shorter duration in
a dog model (10–20 vs ≥60 min recovery period)[39,41]
generally, no clinically relevant effect on cerebral blood flow,[7,8,12,25-28,37] cerebrovascular co2 reactivity,[27,28] cerebral capacity[17] or
intracranial pressure[37] in healthy adult volunteers and surgical pts
decreases or maintains intraocular pressure in pts undergoing elective eye surgery[30-33]
respiratory effects
dose-dependently decreased respiratory rate and increased etco2[13]
like alf, rem caused dose-dependent respiratory depression; nadir occurred 2.5–5 min after a single rem bolus dose[10,13,14]
rem reduced the slope and caused a downward shift in the co2 ventilatory response curve; nadir at 2.5 min; recovery complete within
15 min postdose[14]

creases in blood pressure and heart rate in adults[24]
(also discussed in section 4) and in animal models[39,41,43] (table i). for example, in six adult volunteers, single bolus doses of  xxxd3094xxx  2–30 mug/kg
during general anaesthesia significantly (all p <
0.001) reduced systolic blood pressure (by
25–40%), diastolic blood pressure (by 27–39%) and
heart rate (by 25–31%) during the 5-minute postdose period; there was no between-dose difference
in these effects.[24] notably, these haemodynamic
effects were not associated with an increase in histamine release, an effect known to exacerbate the
haemodynamic effects of morphine, in 24 surgical
inpatients receiving  xxxd3094xxx  2–30 mug/kg infused
over 1 minute.[24] hypotension and bradycardia

stimulation of mu-opioid receptors of the cardiovascular and peripheral nervous system in a rabbit
model (section 5).[43]
 xxxd3094xxx  had no clinically relevant effects on
intraocular[30-33] or intracranial[37] pressure (table i),
suggesting the drug may be a suitable option for use
in neurosurgery (section 4.2.3) and opthalmic surgery (section 4.3.1). furthermore, the drug had no
clinically relevant effects on cerebral blood
flow,[7,8,12,25-28,37] cerebrovascular carbon dioxide
(co2) reactivity[27,28] or cerebral capacity[17] in adult
surgical patients and healthy volunteers (table i).
like alfentanil,  xxxd3094xxx  caused dose-dependent respiratory depression in healthy volunteers,
with a nadir at 2.5–5 minutes postdose (table
i).[10,13,14] in the largest study in 48 healthy volundrugs 2005; 65 (13)

 xxxd3094xxx : a review

teers, peak effect on arterial co2 and oxygen tension
occurred 5 minutes after a single intravenous dose of
 xxxd3094xxx  (0.0625–2 mug/kg) or alfentanil (8–32
mug/kg).[10] although the maximal effect with the
highest dose of each agent was similar for both
parameters, the duration of this effect (i.e. time to
return to 10% of baseline) appeared to be shorter
with  xxxd3094xxx  (20 vs 30 minutes; no statistical
data reported).[10]
 xxxd3094xxx  provides hypnotic sparing effects
when used in association with volatile anaesthetics
and is synergistic in combination with propofol (table i).[18,22,23,34-36] in a randomised, nonblind, twocentre trial in 220 patients undergoing elective surgery,  xxxd3094xxx  caused a dose-dependent reduction in the minimum alveolar concentration (mac)
of isoflurane, with a 50%, 77% and 91% reduction
in mac with  xxxd3094xxx  arterial whole blood concentrations of 1.37, 4 and 32 ng/ml, respectively.[23]
based on historical data, plasma concentrations of
fentanyl and sufentanil required to produce a 50%
reduction in mac of isoflurane were 1.67 and
0.14 ng/ml.[23] in combination with intravenous
propofol,  xxxd3094xxx  had synergistic effects on cardiorespiratory and hypnotic responses in patients
undergoing elective surgery[34,35] and in healthy volunteers,[18] based on changes in the bispectral index.
in 20 healthy volunteers, with therapeutic doses of
propofol plus  xxxd3094xxx , there was a reduction in
the bolus dose of  xxxd3094xxx  required to achieve a
given plasma-effect concentration, whereas the infusion rate for propofol remained unchanged.[22] since
therapeutic doses of  xxxd3094xxx  provide significant
hypnotic sparing effects, doses of these concomitant
hypnotic agents should be based on those recommended by the manufacturer (section 6).[47]
the effect of  xxxd3094xxx -based anaesthesia on
biochemical markers of stress responses was generally similar to that seen with other opioid-containing
anaesthetic regimens. in a randomised, double-blind

room.[48] both opioid agents were associated with an
increase in plasma glucose concentration 30 minutes
after skin incision.[48] in another randomised trial in
20 paediatric patients undergoing coronary artery
bypass graft (cabg) surgery,  xxxd3094xxx  generally also showed similar effects to fentanyl on these
biochemical indicators.[49] although  xxxd3094xxx  recipients experienced a greater increase in serum
glucose levels from baseline than fentanyl recipients
in this study, the between-group difference was not
considered sufficient to indicate an increase in stress
responses in the  xxxd3094xxx  group.
3. pharmacokinetic profile
the pharmacokinetic properties of intravenous
 xxxd3094xxx  have been investigated in surgical patients of all ages,[50-58] and in healthy adult volunteers,[10,15,59-63] including adults with renal[58,62,63] or
hepatic[57,61] impairment. some data were also reported in the manufacturer’s prescribing information[47] and reviews.[45,64] all pharmacokinetic parameters for  xxxd3094xxx  and alfentanil were assessed using arterial blood samples.
 xxxd3094xxx  exhibits a linear, dose-dependent
pharmacokinetic profile,[59] with its distribution described by a two- or three-compartmental model
(table ii;[10,50] also see table iii[61-63] for data in
healthy volunteers). the drug is rapidly distributed
throughout the body, has a small mean volume of
distribution at steady state (vdss) of 260–415 ml/
kg, and is ≈70% bound to plasma proteins (reviewed
by lauwers et al.[64]). the drug exhibits rapid equilibrium across the blood-brain barrier.[50]
 xxxd3094xxx  rapidly crossed the placental barrier
following an intravenous infusion (0.1 mug/kg/min)
in 19 parturients, although the drug was rapidly
metabolised and/or redistributed in the neonate and
had no clinically relevant effects on the neonate
(section 4.2.5).[56]
 xxxd3094xxx  is rapidly and extensively
metabolised by nonspecific blood and tissue esterases mainly to the relatively inactive carboxylic acid
metabolite gr90291 (section 2), with minimal metabolism also occurring via n-dealkylation in
humans.[44,47,50,57] the majority (≥88% of the dose)

elimination of rem was described as biexponential rather
than triexponential, corresponding to a distribution and
terminal phase.

of the carboxylic metabolite is eliminated in the
urine (section 3.1),[10,47] although some is excreted
in the faeces.[65] the mean terminal elimination halflife (t1/2beta) of this metabolite ranged from 88.1 to
137.4 minutes following bolus doses of  xxxd3094xxx 
2–30 mug/kg.[50]
the extensive extravascular metabolism of
 xxxd3094xxx  by nonspecific esterases correlates with
a mean clearance (cl) rate that exceeds the average
hepatic blood flow by ≈3- to 4-fold (247–297 vs 80
l/h).[50] moreover, based on an in vitro study,[66] the
pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd3094xxx  is unlikely
to be affected by inherited or acquired deficiencies
in plasma cholinesterases, such as  xxxg248xxx .[64]
the context-sensitive half-time (i.e. the time required for a 50% reduction in the effect site concentration after a continuous infusion designed to maintain a constant effect site concentration) rather than
the t1/2beta value may provide a better indication of the
rate of elimination of drugs like  xxxd3094xxx  that
exhibit
multicompartmental
pharmacokinetics.[10,50,67] following infusions of up to 240 minutes
in patients undergoing elective surgery, the contextsensitive half-time of  xxxd3094xxx  was 3.7 versus
© 2005 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

33.9, 58.5 and 262.5 minutes with sufentanil, alfentanil and fentanyl, respectively.[50] other studies
also indicated that  xxxd3094xxx  had a very short
context-sensitive half-time (≤3 minutes).[59,67] notably, the context-sensitive half-time of  xxxd3094xxx 
was independent of the duration of infusion, unlike
that of other mu-opioid receptor agonists that show an
increase in the context-sensitive half-time as the
duration of the infusion increases.[10,15,50,59,67]
relative to alfentanil,  xxxd3094xxx  had a similar
mean volume of distribution of the central compartment (vdc) and distribution half-life; however,
 xxxd3094xxx  had an ≈5-fold greater mean cl and a
shorter mean t1/2beta value than alfentanil and exhibits a
biexponential rather than triexponential profile (no
statistical data reported) [table ii].[10] the relatively
short mean t1/2beta value with  xxxd3094xxx  versus alfentanil was confirmed in another study (35.1 vs
94.5 minutes), with a mean cl from the central
compartment that was ≈8-fold greater with
 xxxd3094xxx  (2.91 vs 0.36 l/min) and mean residence time ≈13-fold shorter (no statistical data reported).[15]
concomitant therapeutic doses of intravenous
 xxxd3094xxx  plus propofol had no effect on the
pharmacokinetics of propofol, whereas the vdc and
distribution cl of  xxxd3094xxx  were significantly
(all p < 0.05) reduced by 41% and cl was reduced
by 15% in 20 healthy adult volunteers, based on a
non-steady state population modelling analysis.[22]
these effects were not concentration dependent and,
although there was a reduction in the bolus dose of
 xxxd3094xxx  required to produce a certain plasma
effect concentration, no clinically relevant change in
the respective maintenance infusion rates was observed.
3.1 in special patient populations

since esterase metabolism of  xxxd3094xxx  is independent of end-organ damage, there were no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetic
profile of the drug in those with renal or hepatic
impairment (table iii).[57,58,61-63] the clinically modest pharmacokinetic effects on the elimination and
clearance of  xxxd3094xxx  in end-stage renal failure

patients observed in one of these studies may, in
part, reflect the reduced fluid volume status shortly
after haemodialysis.[58] although the main metabolite is eliminated renally and accumulates in those
with renal impairment, the relatively low potency of
the metabolite versus the parent compound means
that this is unlikely to be clinically relevant.[62,63]
the markedly reduced clearance of  xxxd3094xxx 
during the anhepatic versus the dissection phase of
an orthotopic liver transplant (table iii) may reflect
the loss of  xxxd3094xxx  through haemorrhage and
the effects of haemodilution.[57]
the mean cl of  xxxd3094xxx  was reduced by
≈20% during the hypothermic phase of cardiopulmonary bypass (core body temperature 28–30°c)
[table iii],[52] with a 3% reduction in cl for each
degree centigrade decrease in body temperature.[47]
this is thought to reflect a decrease in nonspecific
esterase activity as the temperature is reduced.[52]
in general, because of altered pharmacological
properties, a reduction in opioid doses is required
with extremes of age, that is in the very young (table
iii)[55] and elderly.[47,60] in a nonblind, two-centre,
single-dose study in surgical patients aged 0 to <18
years, there were significant age-related changes in
the mean vdss and cl values, although the inverse
relationship of cl to age meant that there were no
between-group differences with regard to mean t1/2beta
values.[55] after correction for bodyweight,
pharmacokinetic parameters of  xxxd3094xxx  in neonates and infants were comparable with those in
adults but, because of limited data, there are currently no recommendations for the use of  xxxd3094xxx  in
those <1 year of age (section 6).[47] in healthy adult
volunteers, there is an approximately 25% reduction
in vdc values and a 33% reduction in cl values
between the age of 20 and 85 years,[60] with the
manufacturer’s prescribing information recommending a 50% reduction in the initial and subsequent adult doses of  xxxd3094xxx  in those aged >65
years.[47]
in obese patients, both the mean vdc and cl of
 xxxd3094xxx  were reduced by about one-third compared with lean patients (table iii), with the ideal
rather than actual bodyweight of recipients better

reflecting these pharmacokinetic parameters.[53]
since the absolute vdc and cl values were comparable in obese patients to those in lean recipients,
dose reductions are recommended in obese patients
and should be based on the ideal bodyweight of the
patient.[47]
there were no clinically relevant effects of gender on the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3094xxx .[60]
4. therapeutic efficacy
the efficacy of intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  during
the induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia for both inpatient and outpatient surgery has
been evaluated in several large, prospective,
randomised, multicentre, controlled trials, the majority of which are fully published. discussion and
tabulation focuses on these trials, although where
data are limited, smaller prospective trials and other
studies are also discussed. within each trial, treatment groups were generally well matched in terms
of age, gender, height, weight, american society of
anesthesiology (asa) physical status, type of surgery and duration of surgery. analyses were based
on the intent-to-treat population unless stated otherwise. in most studies, patients had an asa physical
status of i–iii.
for the maintenance of anaesthesia,  xxxd3094xxx 
was typically administered as a continuous intravenous infusion, with additional bolus doses given
over not less than 30 seconds as required, such as in
response to light anaesthesia or during transient
episodes of intense surgical stress. anaesthesia
agents were administered intravenously, except for
halothane, isoflurane,  xxxd1844xxx ,  xxxd3197xxx  and
nitrous oxide (n2o) which were inhaled.
4.1 in the induction of general anaesthesia
in adults

several randomised, double-blind trials enrolling
at least 60 adult patients have evaluated the use of
 xxxd3094xxx  bolus doses as a component of induction regimens prior to general anaesthesia in adults
undergoing surgery.[68-74] with the exception of two
trials,[71,75] no neuromuscular blocking agent was
used during induction of anaesthesia. efficacy padrugs 2005; 65 (13)

rameters assessed included changes in haemodynamic parameters (mean arterial pressure [map]
and heart rate) and the acceptability of intubating
conditions. intubating conditions were defined as
poor, good or excellent based on jaw relaxation, the
degree vocal cords were open, degree of coughing
and/or limb movement during and after intubation,
and rigidity. additional results are also presented in
section 4.2 and, in particular, in patients undergoing
cabg surgery (section 4.2.2).
in dose-finding trials using propofol anaesthesia,
higher bolus doses of  xxxd3094xxx  (typically >2 mug/
kg) generally provided acceptable (good to excellent
conditions) intubating conditions in a greater percentage of patients than lower doses of the
drug.[69,72-74] for example, in the largest trial
(n = 80),  xxxd3094xxx  1, 2, 3 or 4 mug/kg provided
acceptable intubating conditions in 35%, 75%,
100% and 95% of patients, respectively; overall
intubating conditions were significantly (all p <
0.05) better in the higher dose groups than with the
lower two doses and in the 2 mug/kg versus the 1 mug/
kg group.[74] patients in all groups resumed spontaneous breathing within 5 minutes after induction of

anaesthesia.[74] a bolus dose of  xxxd3094xxx 
0.25–1 mug/kg or placebo in association with intravenous thiopental sodium 5–7 mg/kg provided acceptable intubating conditions in ≥90% of patients
(n = 20/group), with no significant intergroup differences.[71]
4.1.1 versus other opioids

significantly (p < 0.05) more patients receiving
 xxxd3094xxx  4 mug/kg had acceptable intubating conditions than those receiving alfentanil, although
there was no difference in the overall intubating
conditions between the  xxxd3094xxx  3 mug/kg and
alfentanil groups (table iv).[68,75] there were also no
between-group differences in mean arterial pressures and heart rate during the induction period.[68,75]
however, in another trial, intubating conditions
were not as good with  xxxd3094xxx  2 mug/kg plus
propofol compared with those achieved with alfentanil 50 mug/kg plus propofol, with significantly
fewer  xxxd3094xxx  recipients having acceptable intubating conditions (table iv).[70] there were no
intergroup differences in mean arterial pressure
(range 63.7–69.8mm hg with  xxxd3094xxx  vs
62.8–69.8mm hg with alfentanil) and heart rate
drugs 2005; 65 (13)

1804

(66.1–70.6 vs 58.8–64.9 beats/min) at any 1-minute
time interval for 5 minutes after intubation. the
sequence of administration of induction agents differed in this trial[70] from that in the other trials,[68,75]
with opioid agents administered after propofol in
this study and prior to propofol in the other trials.
 xxxd3094xxx  was as effective as alfentanil or
fentanyl in blunting the haemodynamic response to
tracheal intubation in 80 morbidly obese (mean
body mass index [bmi] 53.2–56.3 kg/m2) adult
patients.[76] two minutes after induction of anaesthesia, mean systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood
pressure, map and heart rate had significantly (all
p < 0.05) decreased from baseline values in all
groups. although these reductions in blood pressure
were greater in the  xxxd3094xxx  and alfentanil
groups than in the fentanyl group, these differences
were not considered clinically relevant. two minutes after tracheal intubation, blood pressure measurements and heart rate were not significantly different from those at baseline in all active treatment
groups, whereas those in the saline group were
significantly (all p < 0.05) higher than baseline
values. in this randomised, single-centre trial, in
addition to propofol 2 mg/kg and cisatracurium 0.2
mg/kg for the induction of anaesthesia, patients received  xxxd3094xxx  1 mug/kg followed by an infusion
of 0.5 mug/kg/min or a bolus dose of fentanyl 1 mug/
kg, alfentanil 10 mug/kg or saline, with all doses
based on the patient’s ideal bodyweight.[76]
 xxxd3094xxx  facilitated laryngeal mask airway
insertion during induction of propofol-based anaesthesia in a randomised, double-blind (n = 120)[77]
and in a nonblind[78] trial (n = 86). in the doubleblind trial, significantly (both p < 0.0001) more
patients experienced excellent insertion conditions
(i.e. no response to insertion) with  xxxd3094xxx  0.25
or 0.5 mug/kg plus propofol 2.5 mg/kg than with
saline (placebo) plus propofol 2.5 mg/kg (82.5%,
85% and 32.5% of patients, respectively), with no
difference between the two  xxxd3094xxx  doses.[77]
after discontinuation of propofol, spontaneous
breathing resumed significantly (both p < 0.0001)
later in the  xxxd3094xxx  groups than in the saline
plus propofol group (mean apnoea time 186 and 284

secs with  xxxd3094xxx  0.25 or 0.5 mug/kg vs 85 secs
with saline). resumption of spontaneous breathing
also occurred earlier with the lower dose of
 xxxd3094xxx  than the higher dose (p < 0.05).[77]
4.2 in the maintenance of general
anaesthesia in adults

in clinical trials evaluating  xxxd3094xxx -containing maintenance regimens, efficacy parameters assessed during the maintenance phase included attenuation of haemodynamic, autonomic and somatic
responses to surgical stimuli such as skin incision/
closure or trocar insertion. endpoints varied between individual trials and were not always clearly
defined as primary or secondary endpoints, particularly where data were only available as abstract
presentations.
4.2.1 general surgery in inpatients

 xxxd3094xxx  provided effective analgesia and
attenuated intraoperative responses as a component
of propofol-based tiva[79-82] or in association with
volatile anaesthetic agents[79-81] in several randomised clinical trials (table v; see table for regimen
details).
in the largest trial involving both inpatients and
outpatients (results are for overall population),[79]
median times to extubation, spontaneous ventilation, qualification for discharge and actual discharge
did not differ significantly, irrespective of whether
 xxxd3094xxx  0.25 mug/kg/min was administered using
propofol-based tiva or using inhaled isoflurane or
 xxxd1993xxx  (table v). significantly (p < 0.05 both
comparisons) fewer  xxxd3094xxx  plus isoflurane or
 xxxd3094xxx  plus  xxxd1993xxx  recipients experienced at
least one intraoperative response to surgical stress
than  xxxd3094xxx  plus propofol recipients (21%,
19% and 28% of patients, respectively). furthermore, respective response rates during intubation
showed that fewer patients receiving volatile anaesthetics responded to tracheal intubation (8%, 7%
and 15%; p < 0.05 both comparisons) and skin
incision (7%, 8% and 13%; p < 0.05 both comparisons). the median time to reach an aldrete score of
≥9 was comparable in all three groups (7–9 minutes), although patients in the  xxxd3094xxx  plus

 xxxd3094xxx : a review

4.2.2 in cardiovascular surgery

in the past, cabg surgery commonly involved
analgesia-based anaesthesia using high doses of
opioids (such as fentanyl 50–100 mug/kg) to ensure
effective attenuation of responses to surgical stimuli
without causing severe myocardial depression.[87,88]
the use of traditional opioids, however, was associated with prolonged recovery because of accumulation of the drug in tissues leading to recrudescent
respiratory depression and a prolonged stay in a
respiratory care unit, all of which added to the costs
of surgery.[87-91] more recently, ‘fast-track’ cabg
surgery, involving reduced doses of opioids (such as
fentanyl 10–20 mug/kg) with concomitant volatile or
intravenous hypnotic agents, has been used to
achieve early tracheal extubation and reduce the
healthcare costs associated with cabg.[88,90,91]

blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and heart
rate were generally significantly (p < 0.05 all comparisons) lower intraoperatively in response to surgical stimuli in the  xxxd3094xxx  than in the fentanyl
group (figure 2). in addition,  xxxd3094xxx  recipients
responded earlier to verbal commands than fentanyl
recipients (9.8 vs 13 minutes, p < 0.001; values
estimated from graph) [table vi]. there was no
between-group difference in the median time until
90% of patients were extubated (10.5 vs 11.5 minutes; values estimated from graph), time to discharge from the operating room (10 minutes both
groups) or in the time to discharge from the postanaesthesia care unit (pacu; times not reported).[85] furthermore, in the same study,  xxxd3094xxx 
recipients experienced a faster recovery of four
functional abilities than fentanyl recipients: walking
without difficulty (13% vs 9% of patients achieved
this in the recovery room; p < 0.05), thinking clearly
(46% vs 37%; p < 0.001), concentrating on television (24% vs 20%; p < 0.05) and communicating
effectively (51% vs 46%; p = 0.005).[86]

there was also no difference between treatment

skin incision (table vii; see table for regimen details).[87,88,92] furthermore, in one of these trials,
significantly (all p < 0.05) fewer patients in the
 xxxd3094xxx  group required a maintenance infusion
rate increase (69% vs 92% of patients), a study
opioid drug bolus dose (65% vs 88%), an isoflurane
concentration increase (20% vs 49%) or treatment
with a vasodilating agent (21% vs 49%).[92] in the
other study, 53% of  xxxd3094xxx  recipients compared with 92% of those receiving fentanyl required
medication to treat inadequate anaesthesia responses, whereas corresponding rates for treatment
of excessive anaesthesia were 82% and 60% (no
statistical analysis reported).[88]
in general, postoperative recovery times were
similar after  xxxd3094xxx - or fentanyl-based anaesthesia regimens in both of these trials.[87,88] for
drugs 2005; 65 (13)

example, there was no difference between treatment
groups in terms of median times to eligibility for
extubation (3.4 vs 3.3 hours in the fentanyl group),
actual extubation (table vii), actual intensive care
unit discharge (1.1 vs 1 day) or actual hospital
discharge (5 vs 4.9 days).[87] in addition, there was
no between treatment group difference in these latter
parameters in those aged <70 years compared with
those ≥70 years of age.[87] in the other trial, although
there was no intergroup difference in most of these
recovery parameters, the median time to eligibility
for (4.9 vs 4.1 hours in the fentanyl group,
p = 0.016) and actual extubation (table vii) were
significantly longer in the  xxxd3094xxx  group.[88]
heart rate (60, 56 vs 69 beats/min), map (76, 68
vs 109mm hg), myocardial blood flow (61, 65 vs
86 ml/100g/min) and myocardial oxygen uptake
(5.8, 5.7 vs 10.2 ml/100g/min) were significantly
(all p < 0.05) reduced compared with the awake
state in 12 adults receiving very high dose
 xxxd3094xxx  (2 mug/kg/min) or  xxxd3094xxx  0.5 mug/
kg/min plus propofol (target plasma level of 2 mug/
ml) anaesthesia in a nonrandomised, single-centre
study.[93] patients were assessed in the awake state
and then at different timepoints using these two
regimens.
following  xxxd3094xxx  (0.5 mug/kg/min) plus
isoflurane and n2o anaesthesia, immediate extubation was possible within 10 minutes of the end of the
operation for most patients (94% of 160 patients)
after off-pump cabg without thoracic epidural analgesia in an observational single-centre study.[94]
myocardial infarction and transient ischaemic heart
attack each occurred in two patients, with no patients experiencing cardiopulmonary complications.
nor were there any deaths during hospitalisation.
the efficacy and safety of this less invasive cardiac
anaesthesia technique warrants further investigation
in well designed randomised, multicentre trials.

ating  xxxd3094xxx  as a component of balanced anaesthesia in patients undergoing elective craniotomy
for space-occupying lesions or vascular surgery are
summarised in table viii.[95-98]
in the largest trial,  xxxd3094xxx -based anaesthesia was at least as effective as fentanyl-based anaesthesia in patients undergoing intracranial surgery
(table viii; see table for regimen details).[96] there
were no statistically significant intergroup differences in the percentage of patients showing intraoperative responses to intubation (17% vs 32% of
patients receiving fentanyl), incision (12% vs 11%),
pin head-holder (19% vs 32%) and skin closure
(12% vs 19%) [values estimated from graph]. although there was no difference in the median time to
extubation (table viii), cumulative data indicated
that  xxxd3094xxx  recipients were 1.67 times more
likely to be extubated at any given timepoint than
those receiving fentanyl (95% ci 1.04, 2.68;
p = 0.035). furthermore,  xxxd3094xxx  recipients
were 2.29 times (95% ci 1.39, 3.79; p = 0.001)
more likely to respond to verbal commands at any
given timepoint during postoperative recovery, with
the median time to respond to verbal commands
being shorter in the  xxxd3094xxx  group (table viii).
in addition, significantly more  xxxd3094xxx  recipients had a normal recovery score 10 minutes postoperatively, although at 20 minutes there was no
between-group difference (table viii; see table for
definition of normal recovery score).  xxxd3094xxx 
recipients also received less isoflurane than those in
the fentanyl group (1.9 vs 4.2 mac/hour).[96]
in a smaller double-blind study, the mean intracranial pressure (13 vs 14mm hg) and the range
of intracranial pressures (0–36 vs 0–38mm hg) were
similar between the  xxxd3094xxx  and fentanyl
groups, as was the mean cerebral perfusion pressure
(78 vs 76mm hg) [see table viii for regimen details].[98] there was also no significant intergroup
difference in the percentage of patients showing
excellent or good brain relaxation (90% vs 77% of
patients in the fentanyl group). no  xxxd3094xxx  recipients experienced severe brain swelling that necessitated intervention, whereas three fentanyl redrugs 2005; 65 (13)

in another double-blind trial (see table viii for
regimen details),[95] fewer  xxxd3094xxx  (percentage
of patients not reported; p < 0.001) than fentanyl
recipients (55%) had increases in systolic blood
pressure and heart rate at intubation, with more
 xxxd3094xxx  recipients having excellent intraoperative brain relaxation scores (68% vs 48%; p = 0.033;

this nonblind trial, postoperative recovery times
were similar in the three treatment groups, including
median time to adequate respiration (intergroup
range 10–13 minutes), extubation (table viii), response to verbal commands (table viii) and discharge from the recovery room (range 111–119 minutes).[97] notably, haemodynamic responses during
opioid infusion occurred significantly less frequently in the  xxxd3094xxx  group than in the alfentanil or

in each of the alfentanil groups; both p < 0.01). a
haemodynamic response was defined as map

authors suggest that the slower recovery times observed in some patients may reflect excessive hypnosis and thus further investigations are warranted
to evaluate optimal anaesthetic regimens required
for these patients.[97]
4.2.4 in day surgery

in outpatients, balanced general anaesthesia requires the use of pharmacological agents that are
effective, but without the adverse sequelae that may
delay or prevent discharge from hospital. thus,
 xxxd3094xxx , with its rapid and predictable offset of
action and lack of recurrent respiratory effects, is a

suitable choice of agent for providing intraoperative
analgesia without affecting recovery.
 xxxd3094xxx  was as effective as alfentanil as part
of propofol-based tiva or in combination with
volatile hypnotic agents in two randomised, doubleblind trials in patients undergoing ambulatory surgery, according to primary endpoint analyses (table
ix; see table for regimen details).[99,100] for example, in the larger trial, the median time taken to
respond to verbal commands (primary endpoint)
was similar in both groups (table ix), although the
median times taken to achieve adequate respiration
(table ix) and extubation (9 vs 6 minutes; p = 0.016)
were significantly longer in the  xxxd3094xxx  than
alfentanil group.[100] of note, these differences in
recovery times were not considered to be of any
clinical significance.[100] furthermore, there were no

group) or actual (19 vs 21 minutes) recovery room
discharge, or in the times to eligibility (157 vs 154
minutes) or actual (206 vs 210 minutes) discharge
from hospital. intraoperatively, significantly fewer
patients in the  xxxd3094xxx  than in the alfentanil
group responded to skin incision (table ix), had at
least one response to surgical stimuli (53% vs 66%
of patients; p = 0.018), required additional bolus
doses to treat these responses to surgical stimuli
(45% vs 59% of episodes treated; p = 0.036) or
required one or more boluses or an increase in
infusion rate of the study drug (41% vs 57% of
patients; p = 0.03).[100]
in a large (n ≈1500), single-blind, multicentre
trial,  xxxd3094xxx  recipients recovered faster (table
ix) and were discharged from hospital sooner than
fentanyl-treated patients (see table ix for anaesthesia regimen details and section 4.2.1 for discussion
of inpatients enrolled in the same trial).[85] the time
until 90% of patients were extubated (9.5 vs 10
minutes, p < 0.05) or had responded to verbal commands (table ix) was significantly shorter in the
 xxxd3094xxx  than in the fentanyl group (all values
estimated from a graph), with a risk ratio analysis
indicating that  xxxd3094xxx  recipients were 1.43
times more likely to respond earlier to verbal commands than fentanyl recipients (95% ci 1.28, 1.59;
p < 0.001). there was no between group difference
in the time to pacu discharge (no times reported).
the median time to eligibility for hospital discharge
occurred significantly earlier in the  xxxd3094xxx 
group (131 vs 137 minutes; relative risk ratio 1.14;
95% ci 1.02, 1.27; p = 0.019), although it should be
noted that the actual intergroup difference in median
time to discharge was small.[85]
4.2.5 in obstetric surgery

limited data are available from a prospective,
randomised, single-blind study in parturients receiving intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  as an adjuvant to
epidural anaesthesia (2% lidocaine) for a caesarean
section (available as an abstract)[101] and from several case studies.[102-106]

in the prospective trial,[101] there were generally
no significant between-group differences in apgar
or neurologic and adaptive capacity scores
(nacs) at most timepoints in neonates born to
mothers receiving  xxxd3094xxx  plus lidocaine versus
those receiving fentanyl plus lidocaine or lidocaine
alone. however, nacs were significantly
(p < 0.05) lower in the  xxxd3094xxx  group than in
other groups at 60 minutes (21% of neonates in this
group had scores <35, with a score of ≥35 considered normal;[107] no data were reported for the other
treatment groups). maternal and foetal blood gas
analyses were within normal limits in all parturients
and neonates, but mild sedation and respiratory
changes occurred. anaesthesia was considered satisfactory for all parturients, with haemodynamic stability maintained in each case. apgar scores were
assessed at 1, 5, 10 and 20 minutes, and nacs
scores at 30 and 60 minutes. parturients received
intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  1 mug/kg/min plus epidural
saline (n = 19), epidural fentanyl 100mug plus intravenous ringer’s solution (n = 9) or placebo (intravenous ringer’s solution plus epidural saline; n = 10).
all patients received epidural 2% lidocaine.[101]
several case reports support the successful use of
 xxxd3094xxx  as an adjunct to general anaesthesia for
emergency caesarean sections in parturients with
severely compromised cardiac function[102-106] and
in a parturient with an acoustic neuroma.[108]

in paediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery
for an atrial septal defect or ventricular septal defect,
‘fast-track’ cardiac anaesthesia using  xxxd3094xxx 
was as effective as a fentanyl-based regimen (table

tric intensive care unit (25 vs 33 hours). nor was
there any difference in the number of patients extubated in the operating theatre (60% vs 72% of patients in the fentanyl group), with no patients in
either group requiring tracheal reintubation after
surgery. in addition, at key timepoints during surgery (such as postinduction, postintubation, preincision, postincision and poststernotomy) there was no
significant intergroup difference in mean systolic
blood pressure. however, heart rates were significantly (all p < 0.01) lower preincision (83 vs 104
beats/min), postincision (86 vs 118 beats/min) and
poststernotomy (90 vs 120 beats/min) in the
 xxxd3094xxx  than in the fentanyl group (all values
estimated from a graph), with twice as many
 xxxd3094xxx  recipients experiencing a greater than
30% reduction in heart rate after induction of anaesthesia (17 vs 8 patients, p < 0.02). the clinical
significance of this decrease in heart rate in the
 xxxd3094xxx  group remains to be determined, since
all patients had a good clinical outcome.[109]
 xxxd3094xxx  was also effective as a component
of balanced anaesthesia in the outpatient setting in
children undergoing various surgical procedures (table x; see table for regimen details).[110,112-114] furthermore,  xxxd3094xxx  was as at least as effective as
alfentanil[113,114] or fentanyl[112] in these trials (table
x). in the largest trial in over 200 children undergoing tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy,  xxxd3094xxx 
recipients were extubated earlier than those receiving fentanyl using halothane or  xxxd3197xxx , as assessed by the distribution of times to extubation
(p = 0.013).[112] nonetheless, there was no intergroup difference in terms of the time to qualify for
pacu (table x) or hospital discharge (median time
ranged from 41–47 minutes across the four treatment groups). there were also no clinically relevant
differences in the intraoperative haemodynamic stability of patients at the time of various surgical
procedures.[112]

function, respectively (section 3). clinical efficacy
data in these patient populations are very limited.
in recipients with end-stage renal disease, recovery parameters were not significantly different after
propofol plus  xxxd3094xxx  tiva from those in patients with normal renal function (n = 22/group).[115]
respective mean times were similar in both patient
populations for the time to adequate respiration (4.8
vs 5.2 minutes), open eyes (4.7 vs 4.8 minutes),
extubation (5.6 vs 6.2 minutes) and discharge to the
pacu (9 vs 9.7 minutes). the induction regimen
consisted of propofol 2–3 mg/kg followed by
 xxxd3094xxx  1 mug/kg, with anaesthesia maintained
using  xxxd3094xxx  0.2 mug/kg/min plus propofol
75 mug/kg/min. patients with normal renal function
had an asa status of i–ii and all patients in both
groups were within 20% of their ideal bodyweight.[115]
4.3.3 in elderly patients

recovery from anaesthesia occurred faster in
younger (<60 years) than in older patients (>60
years) receiving  xxxd3094xxx  as a component of
propofol-based tiva during elective laparotomy.[116] in this prospective, randomised, nonblind
trial, mean times to spontaneous respiration (0.8 vs
3.2 minutes), adequate respiration (3.4 vs 7.6 minutes), opening of their eyes (0.9 vs 3.6 minutes) and
recovery room entry (8.8 vs 14.5 minutes) were all
significantly (all p < 0.05) shorter in younger than in
older patients (n = 20/group). the mean time to
extubation was 5 minutes in younger patients versus
9 minutes in older patients (p = 0.058). anaesthesia
was induced using a  xxxd3094xxx  1 mug/kg bolus and
propofol 1–2 mg/kg and maintained with
 xxxd3094xxx  0.25 mug/kg/min and a propofol infusion. patients had an asa status of i–ii and were
within 20% of their ideal bodyweight.[116]
elderly patients (>65 years of age) receiving
 xxxd3094xxx -based anaesthesia experienced a faster
recovery of cognitive function and some other recovery parameters than recipients of a fentanylbased regimen.[117] in this randomised, single-blind
trial in patients undergoing spinal surgery, mean
times to opening of eyes (2.3 vs 4.8 minutes), extubation (3.2 vs 6.8 minutes) and verbalisation (3.9
drugs 2005; 65 (13)

 xxxd3094xxx : a review

vs 9.9 minutes) were all significantly (p < 0.0001)
shorter in the  xxxd3094xxx  group, although there was
no intergroup difference in time to spontaneous respiration (1.9 vs 3.2 minutes). there was also no
difference between treatment groups in the time to
discharge from the pacu (163 vs 166 minutes).
notably, patients in the  xxxd3094xxx  group recovered their cognitive function faster than those in the
fentanyl group, with significant (all p < 0.001) differences in mean mini-mental status scores in favour of  xxxd3094xxx  at 15 (23.7 vs 16.3 in the
fentanyl group), 30 (26.3 vs 20.2) and 60 minutes
(27.5 vs 23.5). for induction, patients received
 xxxd3094xxx  1 mug/kg plus thiopental sodium 4 mg/
kg or fentanyl 2 mug/kg plus thiopental sodium 4 mg/
kg, with both groups receiving suxamethonium
chloride 1.5 mg/kg, all administered intravenously.
in the  xxxd3094xxx  group, anaesthesia was maintained with  xxxd3094xxx  0.25 mug/kg/min plus n2o.
anaesthesia was maintained using inhaled n2o plus
isoflurane in the fentanyl group, with patients receiving fentanyl boluses as required up to a total of
7 mug/kg.[117]
4.3.4 in obese patients

in obese adult patients undergoing laparoscopic
cholecystectomy in the outpatient setting,  xxxd3094xxx  facilitated early recovery from anaesthesia using  xxxd3197xxx .[118] mean recovery times were significantly (all p < 0.05) shorter for time to awakening (6 vs 11 minutes), extubation (7 vs 12 minutes),
arrival in the pacu (13 vs 17 minutes) and to be
orientated (14 vs 18 minutes) in  xxxd3094xxx  plus
 xxxd3197xxx  recipients than in those receiving
 xxxd3197xxx  (n = 15/group); this more rapid emergence reflects the anaesthetic-sparing effect of
 xxxd3094xxx . of note, although corresponding mean
times to discharge from the pacu (66 vs 66 minutes) and readiness for home (224 vs 241 minutes)
were similar in both treatment groups, any potential
between-group differences in these latter recovery
times may have been masked by the recovery policy
at the institution conducting this study that required
all obese patients to remain in the pacu for at least
60 minutes after general anaesthesia. in this
randomised, single-centre study, anaesthesia was

induced intravenously in both groups using fentanyl
1 mug/kg, propofol 1.5 mg/kg and rocuronium 0.6
mg/kg. maintenance anaesthesia was based on
 xxxd3094xxx  0.05–2 mug/kg/min plus  xxxd3197xxx 
with n2o or  xxxd3197xxx  with n2o. the mean bmi
of patients was 42 kg/m2 in the  xxxd3094xxx  group
and 40 kg/m2 in the control group.[118]
5. tolerability
in clinical trials discussed in section 4,
 xxxd3094xxx  was generally well tolerated as a component of induction[69,77,79] and maintenance regimens[79,80,82,83,87,88,96,100,110,112-114] for general anaesthesia in adults and children undergoing surgery.
common adverse events associated with
 xxxd3094xxx  treatment during perioperative use,
such as bradycardia (2–12%),[79,82,83,87,100,113,114]
muscle rigidity (0–8%),[79,80,82,83,87,96,100] nausea
(12–47%),[79,80,83,87,88,96,100]
vomiting
(3–33%),[79,80,83,87,88,96,100,114]
hypotension
(6–30%)[79,82,83,87,88,96,100]
and
shivering
(6–26%)[79,80,83,88,100] are typical of those reported
with all mu-opioid receptor agonists and resolved
rapidly upon discontinuation of the drug or reduction in the infusion rate (reviewed by lauwers et
al.[64]). for example, in the largest (n = 2438) trial
discussed in section 4,[85] the most common adverse
events that were possibly or probably drug-related
and occurred in at least 2% of patients (inpatients
and outpatients) during induction and maintenance
of anaesthesia with  xxxd3094xxx -containing regimens were hypotension, hypertension and bradycardia (figure 3;[119] see table vi and table ix and for
anaesthetic regimens).
the nature of adverse events occurring in
 xxxd3094xxx  recipients was generally similar to that
seen in fentanyl recipients, although hypotension
occurred with a higher frequency in  xxxd3094xxx 
recipients (figure 3).[119] in addition, in the overall
population (21% vs 11% of patients) and in subgroup analyses of inpatients (34% vs 16%) and
outpatients (26% vs 9%), significantly (all p < 0.05)
more  xxxd3094xxx  than fentanyl recipients experienced at least one drug-related adverse event. there
were no between-group differences in the intensity

a similar incidence in both the  xxxd3094xxx  and
fentanyl groups, irrespective of whether surgery was
conducted on an inpatient (31.9% vs 29.7% of patients) or outpatient setting (22.7% vs 22.3%).[85]
there was also no intergroup difference in the severity of nausea; 60%, 35% and 5% of recipients in
each treatment group experienced mild, moderate or
severe nausea, respectively. a similar percentage of
outpatients in each treatment group experienced
vomiting postoperatively (10% vs 9.9% with
fentanyl treatment); however, among inpatients, the
incidence of vomiting was higher in  xxxd3094xxx 
recipients (15.5% vs 12.5%; p < 0.05), although
there was no difference between treatments in the
time to resolution of nausea and vomiting (data not
reported).[85] these data are generally supported by
results from other trials discussed in section
4.[87,88,96]

in clinical trials discussed in section 4, treatmentemergent adverse events associated with
 xxxd3094xxx -containing anaesthesia regimens were
similar in nature to those experienced by recipients
of alfentanil-containing regimens, although some
individual adverse events occurred more frequently
in  xxxd3094xxx  recipients than in those receiving
alfentanil.[83,97,100,113,114] in the largest trial (see table
vi for trial design and anaesthesia regimen),[83] there
was no intergroup difference in the overall incidence
(i.e. during the entire perioperative period) of adverse events in the  xxxd3094xxx  and alfentanil
groups, with 82% versus 75% of alfentanil recipients experiencing at least one adverse event. nonetheless, during the maintenance phase, hypotension
(30% vs 10% of patients; p < 0.001) and bradycardia
(10% vs 3%; p < 0.05) occurred significantly more
frequently in the  xxxd3094xxx  group.[83] although
adverse events were typically mild in intensity, ten
 xxxd3094xxx  recipients experienced life-threatening
drug-related adverse events, including apnoea, thoracic muscle rigidity, respiratory depression, hypotension and hypertension. all adverse events, including these latter events, fully resolved with a

6. dosage and administration
intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  (bolus doses or an infusion) is recommended as an analgesic agent for use
during the induction and/or maintenance of general
anaesthesia in adults (table xi).[47] in children aged
1–12 years, it is recommended for use during the
maintenance phase of anaesthesia; however, it is not
currently recommended for use during the induction
phase in these patients (table xi). there are no
specific recommendations for the use of
 xxxd3094xxx  in adolescents in the manufacturer’s
prescribing information. the dose of  xxxd3094xxx 
should be based upon the individual’s response;
since the formulation contains glycine, the drug
should not be administered via intrathecal or
epidural routes.[47] the manufacturer’s local prescribing information provides further details of the
use of  xxxd3094xxx  in special patient populations,
contraindications and precautions.
7. place of  xxxd3094xxx  in the induction
and maintenance of
general anaesthesia

induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia

men dependent upon several factors including the
type of surgery being undertaken, the functional
status of the patient, the availability of skilled staff,
and on societal and pharmacoeconomic considerations.[3] modern anaesthesia for general surgery typically involves a balanced approach that includes
analgesia, sedation and muscle relaxation, with potent opioids commonly providing the intraoperative
analgesia in these regimens.[1] judicious use of
opioid analgesic agents reduces the requirement for
anaesthetic, provides cardiovascular stability by
suppressing sympathetic stimulation and facilitates
comfortable postoperative awakening. however, at
doses that provide optimal analgesia and/or with
prolonged use, traditional opioids (such as fentanyl
and its derivatives alfentanil and sufentanil) may be
associated with tolerability issues (e.g. nausea,
vomiting) and delayed postoperative recovery due
to respiratory depression. these effects are a consequence of accumulation of the opioid agent in peripheral compartments to the extent that a decline in
drug concentration becomes protracted.[1]
the pharmacodynamic profile of  xxxd3094xxx  is
generally typical of that for all opioid agonists (section 2), with the key differential features lying in its
unique pharmacokinetic profile (section 3). metabolism of the ester linkage by nonspecific esterases

provides the drug with a rapid offset of action and
short context-sensitive half-time irrespective of the
duration or rate of the infusion. thus, ensuring rapid, titratable, prolonged and intense analgesia and, at
the same time, providing a fast and predictable
recovery. furthermore, because of the lack of accumulation of  xxxd3094xxx  in tissues regardless of
the duration of the infusion or dose used, recipients
of the drug are unlikely to experience delayed respiratory depression associated with prolonged use
and/or high doses of other opioid agonists.[120] ironically, this rapid dissipation of analgesic effect (section 2) also accounts for the major disadvantages
associated with  xxxd3094xxx  treatment such as the
requirement for an infusion pump to administer the
drug and the lack of residual postoperative analgesia, which necessitates administration of an alternative analgesic agent in sufficient time prior to discontinuation of  xxxd3094xxx  to ensure adequate analgesia is maintained postoperatively.[121]
in several randomised, comparative trials, adjunctive intravenous bolus doses and/or an infusion
of  xxxd3094xxx , provided effective analgesia and
attenuated intraoperative haemodynamic, autonomic and somatic responses to various stimuli during
the induction (section 4.1) and maintenance (section
4.2) of general anaesthesia in a broad spectrum of
patients undergoing various surgical procedures.
the drug was effective in combination with volatile
or intravenous hypnotic agents (section 4.2) and in
both the inpatient (section 4.2.1) and outpatient setting (section 4.2.4). the rapid and predictable offset
of action and lack of recurrent respiratory effects
with  xxxd3094xxx  make the drug a particularly useful
option in the ambulatory setting (section 4.2.4) and
in situations, such as neurosurgery (section 4.2.3)
and cardiovascular surgery (section 4.2.2), where a
rapid emergence from anaesthesia without adverse
sequelae is important.  xxxd3094xxx -containing regimens were generally at least as effective as fentanylor alfentanil-containing regimens in clinical trials
discussed in section 4, as assessed by attenuation of
responses to intraoperative stimuli and by postoperative recovery parameters.

although data are generally relatively limited,
 xxxd3094xxx  was effective as the opioid component
during balanced anaesthesia in patients with
comorbid conditions, including obesity (section
4.3.4), renal impairment or hepatic impairment (section 4.3.2), and in patients of all ages, including in
elderly (section 4.3.3) and paediatric patients (section 4.3.1).  xxxd3094xxx , unlike some other traditional opioids, is suitable for use in those with renal
or hepatic impairment (section 4.3.2), with no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetic profile
of  xxxd3094xxx  in these patient populations (section
3.1). in contrast, the duration of action of alfentanil
and fentanyl is prolonged in patients with hepatic
impairment because of accumulation of the individual drug, with both drugs metabolised in the liver to
inactive and/or active metabolites (reviewed by mason[46]). elimination of these metabolites occurs, at
least in part, via the kidneys. in the elderly and in
obese patients, alterations in the pharmacokinetic
profile of  xxxd3094xxx  (section 3.1) mean that dose
reductions are recommended, with the dose based
on the ideal rather than actual bodyweight of patients. experience of the use of  xxxd3094xxx  in obstetrics is very limited (section 4.2.5) and thus, the
drug should be used with caution in this setting.[47]
intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  bolus doses or infusions
were generally well tolerated as a component of
induction- and maintenance-regimens for general
anaesthesia in adults and children undergoing surgery (section 5). common adverse events associated
with  xxxd3094xxx  treatment during the perioperative
period, such as muscle rigidity (0–8%), bradycardia
(2–12%), hypotension (6–30%), nausea (12–47%),
vomiting (3–33%) and shivering (6–26%), are typical of those reported with all mu-opioid receptor
agonists. the nature and intensity of adverse events
was generally similar in  xxxd3094xxx , fentanyl and
alfentanil groups, although in some individual
clinical trials treatment-emergent events (e.g. hypotension, bradycardia and muscle rigidity) occurred
with a higher incidence in  xxxd3094xxx  than in
fentanyl and/or alfentanil recipients. these events
resolved rapidly upon discontinuation of the drug or

 xxxd3094xxx : a review

a reduction in the infusion rate and/or with appropriate treatment.
pharmacoeconomic considerations play an increasing role in determining the choice of anaesthetic agent used. at present, the lack of robust, well
designed pharmacoeconomic trials precludes any
definitive conclusions about the relative costs and
benefits of  xxxd3094xxx  versus other opioid
analgesics. available studies[122-130] were small and
based on single-centre costs; thus, these studies are
fraught with the inherent difficulties of extrapolating from single-centre studies, such as the variability in costs and anaesthetic practices between individual centres. whether the use of  xxxd3094xxx  will
lead to cost savings for a hospital depends on the
hospital reimbursement system and hospital specific
conditions, such as capacity utilisation, returns of
scale, unit costs and internal hospital processes.
clearly, there is a need to evaluate the pharmacoeconomic benefits of  xxxd3094xxx  in different settings
and countries.
in conclusion, adjunctive intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  during general anaesthesia is an effective and
generally well tolerated opioid analgesic in a broad
spectrum of patients, including adults and paediatric
patients, undergoing several types of surgical procedures in both the inpatient and outpatient setting.
 xxxd3094xxx  is efficacious in combination with intravenous or volatile hypnotic agents, with these
regimens generally being at least as effective as
fentanyl- or alfentanil-containing regimens in terms
of attenuation of haemodynamic, autonomic and
somatic intraoperative responses, and postoperative
recovery parameters. the rapid offset of action and
short context-sensitive half-time of  xxxd3094xxx , irrespective of the duration of the infusion, makes the
drug a valuable opioid analgesic option for use
during balanced general inhalational or tiva where
rapid, titratable, intense analgesia of variable duration, and a fast and predictable recovery are required.
