1 the present study analyses the short- (15 min ± 2 h) and long-term (24 ± 48 h) in¯uences of
calcitonin gene-related peptide (cgrp) on  xxxg38xxx  ( xxxg38xxx ) expression in the rat
cultured skeletal muscle and the signal transduction events underlying cgrp actions.
2 to assess the eect of cgrp on  xxxg38xxx  synthesis, myotubes were pre-exposed to the irreversible
 xxxg38xxx  inhibitor diisopropyl ¯uorophosphate ( xxxd2393xxx ) and treated with cgrp or  xxxd1742xxx , an
adenylyl cyclase (ac) activator. treatment of myotubes with 1 ± 100 nm cgrp for 2 h increased by
up to 42% the synthesis of catalytically active  xxxg38xxx  with a parallel increase in the intracellular
 xxxd1773xxx .
3 the stimulation of  xxxg38xxx  synthesis induced by cgrp was mimicked by direct activation of ac
with 3 ± 30 mm  xxxd1742xxx . in contrast, pre-treatment of cultures with 100 nm cgrp for 20 h reduced
by 37% the subsequent synthesis of  xxxg38xxx , resulting in a 15% decrease in total  xxxg38xxx  activity after
48 h cgrp treatment.
4 moreover, 24 h treatment of myotubes with 100 nm cgrp reduced by 54% the accumulation of
 xxxd1773xxx  induced by a subsequent cgrp treatment.
5 these ®ndings indicate that, in skeletal muscle cells, cgrp modulates the  xxxg38xxx  expression in a
time-dependent manner, initially stimulating the enzyme synthesis through a  xxxd1773xxx -dependent
mechanism. the decreased  xxxg38xxx  synthesis observed after long-term cgrp treatment suggests that
cgrp signalling system is subject to desensitization or down-regulation, that might function as an
important adaptative mechanism of the muscle ®bre in response to long-term changes in
neuromuscular transmission.

introduction
calcitonin gene-related peptide (cgrp) is a 37-amino acid
peptide generated by the alternative splicing of the calcitonin
gene in the central and peripheral nervous system (amara et
al., 1982; rosenfeld et al., 1983). in motoneurons, electrical
stimulation of the nerve induces the release of cgrp which
interacts with speci®c postsynaptic receptors and functions as
a regulatory factor (popper & micevych, 1989; uchida et al.,
1990; roa & changeux, 1991). the biological eects of
cgrp on the skeletal muscle are mediated by the stimulation
of speci®c g protein coupled-receptors linked to  xxxd1773xxx 
elevation through the activation of adenylyl cyclase (ac)
(laufer & changeux, 1987; uchida et al., 1990).
in the vertebrate skeletal muscle, activation of cgrp
receptors potentiates neurally evoked muscle contraction
(takami et al., 1985; takamori & yoshikawa, 1989),
increases the synthesis and the insertion of nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor (achr) in the membrane (fontaine

et al., 1986; new & mudge, 1986) and enhances the rate of
achr desensitization (mulle et al., 1988).
recent studies have also described the in¯uences of cgrp
on  xxxg38xxx  ( xxxg38xxx , e.c.3.1.1.7) expression. for
example, in chick primary myotube cultures, 16 ± 24 h
exposure to cgrp substantially increased mrna and the
non-catalytic pool of  xxxg38xxx  without signi®cant changes in the
enzyme activity (choi et al., 1998). conversely, mouse
myotube cultures exposed to cgrp for 48 h showed a
decreased expression of  xxxg38xxx  and its transcripts (boudreaularivieáre & jasmin, 1999). these divergent eects have been
attributed to dierent regulatory mechanisms involved on
skeletal muscle  xxxg38xxx  expression, in rodent and avian
(boudreau-larivieáre & jasmin, 1999). however, independently of the animal species studied, these results suggest that
long-term exposure to cgrp could alter the functional
organization of cgrp receptor-signalling system resulting in
either desensitization or down-regulation of the receptortransduction system.
taking into account that the actual knowledge regarding
the in¯uences of cgrp on the skeletal muscle  xxxg38xxx  is based

230

v. l. da costa jr et al

mainly on the long-term eects of this neuropeptide and that
cgrp receptors might be subjected to desensitization or
down-regulation after chronic stimulation (drake et al.,
1999), we studied the short- and long-term in¯uences of
cgrp on the synthesis of  xxxg38xxx  in rat primary cultured
myotubes. more importantly, considering that cgrp may
regulate  xxxg38xxx  biogenesis through adenylyl cyclase activation, we also analysed the short- and long-term eects of
cgrp treatment on the intracellular levels of  xxxd1773xxx .
our present ®ndings indicate that in rat skeletal muscle
cultures, cgrp induces a transient increase on the synthesis
of  xxxg38xxx  that parallels an enhancement in the intracellular
 xxxd1773xxx  content. we also show evidence that the
reduction in  xxxg38xxx  activity after long-term treatment of
myotubes with cgrp is mediated by a down-regulation of
cgrp receptor/ac transduction system. these short- and
long-term eects of cgrp on the regulation of protein
expression in the neuromuscular junction may be an
important mechanism to the skeletal muscle plasticity in
response to changes in the physiological demand of this
synapse.

methods
skeletal muscle cultures
primary skeletal muscle cultures were obtained from hindlimb
muscles of newborn rats. brie¯y, the animals were killed
under co2 anaesthesia, the muscles were removed and the
cells dissociated in hanks'  xxxd2988xxx  (hbss),
ph 7.4, containing collagenase type ia (200 u ml71). the
myoblasts (36105 cells ml71) were grown on collagen-coated
35 mm dishes in 2 ml of dulbecco's modi®ed eagle medium
(d-mem, gibco ± brl, gaithersburg, u.s.a.) supplemented
with 10% horse serum (hs), 10% foetal calf serum (fcs)
and 40 mg ml71 gentamicin, at 378c in humidi®ed atmosphere
of 90% air and 10% co2. the medium was replaced on the
third day and every other day with d-mem supplemented
with 10% hs and 2% fcs (complete culture medium). drug
treatments were performed on 6 ± 7-day-old cultures. at this
stage, myotubes were multinucleated and contracting cells
indicating an appropriate maturation of the muscle ®bres.
in some experiments, the eect of cgrp was analysed on
chicken cultured myotubes obtained from hindlimb muscles
of 10-day-old embryos using the same procedure described
above.

effect of drugs on total  xxxg38xxx  activity and on the
synthesis of catalytically active enzyme
rat cultured myotubes were incubated with 10 ± 1000 nm
cgrp in complete culture medium at 378c in humidi®ed
atmosphere of 90% air and 10% co2. after 24 or 48 h, the
cells were rinsed three times with hbss, the  xxxg38xxx  was
extracted and the enzyme activity assayed as described below.
to avoid cgrp degradation after 48 h treatment, following
the ®rst 24 h cgrp treatment, the medium containing
cgrp was replaced with fresh medium containing cgrp
as described by boudreau-larivieáre & jasmin (1999).
to determine whether activation of cgrp receptor or
adenylyl cyclase stimulated the ongoing myotube  xxxg38xxx

synthesis, 7-day-old muscle cultures were rinsed three times
with hbss, ph 7.4, followed by 10 min incubation with
100 mm diisopropyl ¯uorophosphate ( xxxd2393xxx ) to irreversibly
inhibit all  xxxg38xxx  molecules. the cells were rinsed with hbss,
to remove the unreacted  xxxd2393xxx  and allowed to synthesize new
 xxxg38xxx  in complete culture medium, in the presence or
absence of cgrp (1 ± 100 nm), the adenylyl cyclase activator
 xxxd1742xxx  (3 ± 30 mm) or vehicle solution.
the eects of short- and long-term stimulation of cgrp
receptor on the synthesis of  xxxg38xxx  was evaluated in cultured
myotubes incubated with 10 nm cgrp for 15 ± 30 min or
20 h, respectively. then, the myotubes were treated with  xxxd2393xxx 
and allowed to synthesize  xxxg38xxx  in complete culture medium
for 2 h.

extraction of total  xxxg38xxx  and enzyme activity assay
 xxxg38xxx  was extracted by scraping the cells using 500 ml of
20 mm borate extraction buer, ph 9.0 (containing 1 m
nacl, 5 mm edta, 0.5% triton x-100, 5 mm  xxxd2684xxx , 2 mm  xxxd302xxx  and 0.7 mm bacitracin). the
samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 r.p.m., at 48c
and total  xxxg38xxx  activity from the supernatant was assayed by
radiometric procedure (johnson & russell, 1975) as described
by rotundo & fambrough (1979) using 3h-ach (0.1 mci,
24 mm; speci®c activity=55.2 mci mmol71) as substrate. the
enzyme activity was assayed in the presence of the
 xxxg248xxx  inhibitor tetraisopropyl pyrophosphoramide (iso-ompa, 10 mm) and the total  xxxg38xxx  activity
(d.p.m. h71) was expressed as arbitrary units (u).

 xxxd1773xxx  accumulation and adenylyl cyclase
activity assay
cultured myotubes were rinsed two times with krebs
bicarbonate solution, pre-incubated with 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1methylxanthine ( xxxd2388xxx ) for 10 min and treated with cgrp
(1 ± 1000 nm),  xxxd1742xxx  (3 ± 30 mm) or vehicle solutions, at
378c. after 15 ± 60 min, the medium was aspirated and the
reaction stopped with 500 ml of cold krebs solution containing
4 mm edta. the samples were transferred to microfuge tubes,
boiled for 10 min and centrifuged at 14,000 r.p.m. for 10 min.
 xxxd1773xxx  from the supernatant was determined using the
 xxxd1773xxx  kit [3h]-assay system. the results were expressed as
pmol of  xxxd1773xxx  per culture dish or per mg of protein.
protein was measured by the method of bradford (1976).
to analyse the eect of long-term cgrp receptor
stimulation on the production of  xxxd1773xxx , cultured
myotubes were treated for 24 h with 100 nm cgrp, 10 mm
 xxxd1742xxx  or vehicle in complete culture medium, rinsed three
times with krebs solution and re-exposed to cgrp for
15 min at 378c in the presence of 0.1 mm  xxxd2388xxx , as
described above.

from day 2 to 6 after plating, the myotube protein content
increased 4.3 times stabilizing at 0.817+0.019 mg dish71

into account that 5 ± 6-day-old cultures exhibited spontaneous
contraction, which indicate an appropriate maturation of the
muscle ®bres, all drug treatments were performed on 6 ± 7day-old cultures.
the synthesis of catalytically active  xxxg38xxx  was analysed
after treatment of 7-day-old myotubes with  xxxd2393xxx , an
irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme. immediately after
removal of unreacted  xxxd2393xxx , the cultured myotubes  xxxg38xxx 
activity was 52.4+5.7 u which represented less than 10% of
the activity of untreated control cultures (534.0+56.3 u).
within 1 and 2 h, the activity of  xxxg38xxx  was 24%
(129.0+12.5 u) and 45% (239.0+16.9 u) of the total  xxxg38xxx 
activity from control cultures, respectively (figure 2). the
rate of synthesis, calculated by linear regression analysis,
corresponded to 18% of total  xxxg38xxx  per hour (figure 2,
inset).

28% (306.5+18.0 u) and 42% (339.7+20.5 u) relative to the

short- and long-term cgrp effects on myotube  xxxg38xxx 

since stimulation of myotube cgrp receptor is known to
activate the g protein-coupled adenylyl cyclase, we analysed
the eect of cgrp on the  xxxd1773xxx  production. as
expected, the increased synthesis of  xxxg38xxx  induced by cgrp
was followed by a proportional increase in the myotube cyclic
amp content (figure 3b). in presence of 1.0 mm  xxxd2388xxx , the
 xxxd1773xxx  content in control cultured myotubes was
20.4+0.8 pmol dish71. treatment of cells with 1, 10 and
100 nm cgrp for 15 min, increased the basal  xxxd1773xxx 
level by 22, 31 and 64%, respectively (figure 3b).
like cgrp, direct activation of ac stimulated the
expression of  xxxg38xxx . in  xxxd2393xxx  pre-treated cultures, incubation
of 3, 10 and 30 mm  xxxd1742xxx  for 2 h increased the  xxxg38xxx 
synthesis by 33% (122.4+8.4 u), 51% (139.3+1.4 u) and
98% (182.1+11.1 u) of control values (92.2+4.7 u, figure
4a) respectively. this eect was followed by a 35, 415 and
810% increase in the myotube  xxxd1773xxx  content
(20.4+0.8 pmol dish71; figure 4b).
to determine the onset of cgrp eect on  xxxg38xxx  synthesis,
in another series of experiments rat and chicken myotubes
were pre-exposed to cgrp for 15 and 30 min, respectively,
treated with  xxxd2393xxx  for 10 min and allowed to synthesize
 xxxg38xxx  for 2 h in complete medium. as shown in figure 5a,
short-term treatment of myotubes with cgrp increased the
subsequent synthesis of  xxxg38xxx  by 17%. this eect was also
observed in chick cultured myotubes resulting in an 11 and

figure 5 rat (a) or chicken (b) cultured myotubes, pre-exposed to
10 nm cgrp for 15 or 30 min were treated with 100 mm  xxxd2393xxx  for
10 min and allowed to synthesize  xxxg38xxx  in complete culture medium
for 2 h.  xxxg38xxx  was extracted and total enzyme activity assayed using
3

47% increase in  xxxg38xxx  synthesis after 15 and 30 min,
respectively (figure 5b).

long-term effects of cgrp treatment on the synthesis of
myotube  xxxg38xxx 
the stimulant eect of cgrp on  xxxg38xxx  however was not
persistent. when rat myotubes were exposed to 10 ± 1000 nm
cgrp for 24 h, total  xxxg38xxx  activity was not signi®cantly
dierent from the control values (600.8+44.1 u) (figure 6a).
however, application of 100 nm cgrp for 48 h reduced the
total  xxxg38xxx  activity to 85% (690.7+31.8 u) of control values
(790.8+28.4 u) (figure 6b). as observed with cgrp,
treatment of cultures with 3, 10 and 30 mm  xxxd1742xxx  for
24 h did not increase the total  xxxg38xxx  activity when compared
to control values (613.5+59.6 u) (figure 6c).
the absence of cgrp eect observed on total  xxxg38xxx 
activity after 24 h treatment could be explained by a
reduction of the synthesis observed during prolonged
exposure to cgrp. when myotubes were pre-exposed to
100 nm cgrp for 20 h, treated with  xxxd2393xxx  for 10 min and
allowed to synthesize  xxxg38xxx  in complete culture medium for
2 h, the synthesis of  xxxg38xxx  was reduced by 37% of control
values (298.9+11.7 u) (figure 6d), suggesting that the
inhibitory eect of cgrp on  xxxg38xxx  synthesis is a timedependent process.
the stimulation of  xxxd1773xxx  production induced by the
cgrp was also transient. figure 7 shows the time course of
cgrp eect on  xxxd1773xxx  accumulation. addition of

100 nm cgrp increased the  xxxd1773xxx  content to a
maximum of 64 ± 68% (37.9+0.4 to 39.9+1.8 pmol dish71)
of control values after 15 ± 30 min stimulation, respectively.
however, after 60 min stimulation, the  xxxd1773xxx  content
(22.2+2.3 pmol dish71) returned to the levels of nonstimulated cultures. the basal level of  xxxd1773xxx ,
determined in the presence of 1 mm  xxxd2388xxx  alone, was not
signi®cantly changed from 15 ± 60 min (20.9+2.9 to
23.8+1.4 pmol dish71, respectively).

long-term exposure of myotubes to cgrp desensitize the
cellular response to the neuropeptide
the lack or even the inversion of cgrp eect on the  xxxg38xxx 
expression after 24 or 48 h treatment suggests that the
receptor-signalling system could be restrained by long-term
exposure to activators. to analyse the in¯uence of long-term
cgrp treatment on the activation of ac, cultured myotubes
were pre-exposed to 100 nm cgrp for 24 h. the cells were
then rinsed with hbss and immediately afterwards re-exposed
to the same concentration of cgrp for 15 min in the presence
of  xxxd2388xxx . figure 8a shows that treatment of myotubes with
cgrp increased by 63% (6.7+0.3 pmol mg protein71) the
basal intracellular  xxxd1773xxx  (4.1+0.1 pmol mg protein71).
however, pre-treatment of myotubes with cgrp attenuated
by 54% the production of  xxxd1773xxx  (5.3+0.4 pmol mg71
protein71) induced by a subsequent cgrp-treatment.

interfere on cgrp-induced ac stimulation, the  xxxd1773xxx

production was evaluated in myotubes pre-exposed or not to
10 mm  xxxd1742xxx  for 24 h. as shown in figure 8b, treatment
of myotubes with cgrp alone for 15 min increased by 28%
the basal  xxxd1773xxx  content (4.3+0.1 pmol dish71). however, cgrp was unable to stimulate the production of cyclic
amp when myotubes were pre-treated with  xxxd1742xxx  for
24 h. in fact, the  xxxd1773xxx  content (3.7+0.2 pmol dish71)
was reduced by 12%, indicating that cgrp lost its ability to
stimulate  xxxd1773xxx  production.

discussion
the eciency of the neuromuscular transmission depends on
the adequate expression of  xxxg38xxx  and achr which in turn is
modulated by the electromechanical activity of the skeletal
muscle and by nerve-derived trophic substances (for review,
see massoulieâ et al., 1993; duclert & changeux, 1995).
several studies have indicated that cgrp might play an
important role in the development of the neuromuscular
synapse by regulating the expression of achr at embryonic
and adult muscle ®bre. the presence of cgrp high anity
binding sites in skeletal muscle membrane has been
demonstrated in mature ®bres and in tissue cultured
myotubes (roa & changeux, 1991; jennings & mudge,
1989). in the skeletal muscle ®bre, these receptors are coupled
to heterotrimeric g protein (gs) and mediate an increase in
 xxxd1773xxx  production through activation of adenylyl
cyclase (van rossun et al., 1997; review).
the present report shows, for the ®rst time, that in rat
primary skeletal muscle cultures, the cgrp modulation of
 xxxg38xxx  synthesis is a time-dependent process. short-term
stimulation of cgrp receptors increases the intracellular
content of  xxxd1773xxx  and induces a proportional enhancement of  xxxg38xxx  synthesis. since direct stimulation of adenylyl
cyclase with  xxxd1742xxx  also increases  xxxg38xxx  synthesis, we
concluded that  xxxd1773xxx  signalling pathway is involved in
cgrp eects. also, 15 ± 30 min exposure to cgrp
stimulated the synthesis of chick myotube  xxxg38xxx , indicating

figure 7 time course of cgrp-dependent  xxxd1773xxx  production
in tissue-cultured skeletal muscle. rat cultured myotubes, preincubated with 1 mm  xxxd2388xxx , were treated with 100 nm cgrp for
15, 30 and 60 min at 378c. the  xxxd1773xxx  was extracted and
measured using a  xxxd1773xxx  [3h]-assay kit. each column represents

that the primary eect of cgrp in avian and in mammalian
species is the increase of  xxxg38xxx  synthesis. this result is
consistent with recent studies indicating that high levels of
 xxxd1773xxx  stimulate the synthesis of  xxxg38xxx  in avian
myotubes (choi et al., 1998). moreover,  xxxd1773xxx 
responsive element (cre) sequences were found either in
mouse (atanasova et al., 1999) or human  xxxg38xxx  genes (ben
aziz-aloya et al., 1993). similarly, the human and chick
 xxxg38xxx  gene promoters were shown to be activated by cyclic
amp-dependent pathway (wan et al., 2000; choi et al.,
2000), suggesting the involvement of cre in mammals and
avian  xxxg38xxx  transcription.
the present results showed that 20 h sustained stimulation
of cgrp receptors reduced the synthesis of catalytically
active  xxxg38xxx  (figure 6d). this decreased  xxxg38xxx  synthesis is
probably responsible for the reduction of total myotube
 xxxg38xxx  activity after 48 h cgrp treatment (figure 6b) and
might be related to the inability of cgrp to maintain
elevated levels of  xxxd1773xxx  after prolonged periods of
receptor stimulation.

figure 8 long-term stimulation of cgrp receptors or adenylyl
cyclase down regulates the cellular response. rat cultured myotubes
were submitted or not to pre-treatment with 100 nm cgrp (a) or
10 mm  xxxd1742xxx  (b) in complete culture medium for 24 h at 378c.
the cells were then rinsed with krebs bicarbonate buer, preincubated with 100 mm  xxxd2388xxx  and stimulated with the same
concentration of cgrp, for 15 min at 378c. the  xxxd1773xxx  was
extracted and measured using  xxxd1773xxx  [3h]-assay kit. each
column represents the mean+s.e.mean; n=4. *signi®cantly dierent

two possible reasons might explain the long-term eects of
cgrp on the synthesis of myotube  xxxg38xxx . first, the receptor
desensitization or down regulation. this hypothesis is
supported by the limited eectiveness of cgrp to stimulate
ac after long-term receptor stimulation (figure 8a). quick
desensitization of g protein-coupled receptors has already
been described after persistent receptor activation (morris &
malbon, 1999; bunemann et al., 1999). the best example is
the b2-adrenoceptor known to be phosphorylated by cyclic
amp-dependent protein kinase (pka) and uncoupled from
g protein (lohse et al., 1990). our results strengthen the
desensitization hypothesis since the maximal  xxxd1773xxx 
increase after cgrp receptor stimulation was observed
within 15 ± 30 min but it returned to basal levels after
60 min. this putative desensitization of cgrp receptor is
further supported by recent ®ndings showing a signi®cant loss
of cgrp receptor responsiveness in sk-n-mc cells, after
20 min incubation of the peptide (drake et al., 1999). in
addition, aiyar et al. (2000) reported that pre-treatment of
hek-293-pr cells with 30 nm cgrp for 30 min induced a
decrease in cgrp-mediated adenylyl cyclase activity that is
accompanied by a 40% decrease in [125i]cgrp binding sites.
cgrp binding analysis in cultured myotubes may be helpful
to corroborate the desensitization hypothesis, herein presented.
a second possibility that might explain the long-term eect
of cgrp on  xxxg38xxx  is the down-regulation of downstream
molecules involved in cgrp signalling pathway (e.g.
adenylyl cyclase). skeletal muscle ®bre expresses at least four
dierent ac, all of them activated by the  xxxg220xxx  of g
protein-coupled receptors. in addition, as described for
 xxxg38xxx , the expression of the skeletal muscle ac isoforms is
in¯uenced by motoneuron. for example, after denervation of
mouse gastrocnemius muscle, there is an increase in  xxxg68xxx  and
ac9 mrna whereas the transcripts of ac6 and ac7 are
decreased (suzuki et al., 1998). also, torgan & kraus (1996)

short- and long-term cgrp effects on myotube  xxxg38xxx

reported a time-dependent adjustment of ac isoform
expression in response to changes in the physiological
demands of the skeletal muscle. an adaptative change of
ac activation or isoform expression could explain the
reduced generation of  xxxd1773xxx  observed after 24 h
stimulation of cgrp receptor and the inability of cgrp
stimulate ac after long-term treatment of myotubes with
 xxxd1742xxx  (figure 8b).
in summary, an important ®nding from our study is that
cgrp increases the  xxxg38xxx  synthesis but the continuous
stimulation of cgrp receptor does not maintain the eect.
oscillation of the intracellular levels of  xxxd1773xxx  could be
a physiological mechanism of skeletal muscle to control
 xxxg38xxx  synthesis. after long-term stimulation (24 ± 48 h) of
cgrp receptors, a non-operational signalling system is
probably the cause for the decreased synthesis of  xxxg38xxx .
simultaneous modi®cation of both cgrp receptor and
downstream signalling system cannot be discarded though.
taking into account that cgrp released in the synaptic
cleft of vertebrate neuromuscular junction stimulates the
muscle  xxxd1773xxx  production (uchida et al., 1990) our
results suggest that, under increased nerve output, cgrp
might increase the rate of  xxxg38xxx  synthesis to down regulate
the excessive stimulation of achr. the decline of cgrp
eects after prolonged treatment of myotubes agrees with the
actual evidences of fast receptor-g protein-eector uncoupling (bunemann et al., 1999), an important mechanism to
adapt muscle ®bre to long-lasting changes in neuromuscular
transmission.
