abstract
purpose: obtaining direct and rapid proof of molecular
activity in early clinical trials is critical for optimal clinical
development of novel targeted therapies.  xxxd3264xxx  is an
oral multitargeted kinase inhibitor with selectivity for fmsrelated  xxxg2198xxx  3/ xxxg801xxx  ( xxxg801xxx ), platelet-derived
growth factor receptor ␣/␤, vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor 1/2, and kit receptor tyrosine kinases.
 xxxg801xxx  is a promising candidate for targeted therapy in acute
myeloid leukemia (aml), because activating mutations
occur in up to 30% of patients. we conducted an innovative
single-dose clinical study with a primary objective to demonstrate inhibition of  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation by  xxxd3264xxx 
in aml.
experimental design: twenty-nine aml patients each
received a single dose of  xxxd3264xxx , escalated from 50 to 350
mg, in increments of 50 mg and cohorts of three to six
patients.  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation and plasma pharmacokinetics were evaluated at seven time points over 48 h after
 xxxd3264xxx  administration, and  xxxg801xxx  genotype was deter-

received 4/1/03; revised 7/15/03; accepted 7/29/03.

mined. study drug-related adverse events occurred in 31%
of patients, mainly grade 1 or 2 diarrhea and nausea, at
higher dose levels.
results: inhibition of  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation was apparent in 50% of  xxxg801xxx –wild-type (wt) patients and in
100% of  xxxg801xxx -mutant patients.  xxxg801xxx  internal tandem duplication (itd) mutants showed increased sensitivity relative to  xxxg801xxx -wt, consistent with preclinical predictions.
the primary end point, strong inhibition of  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation in >50% patients, was reached in 200 mg and
higher dose cohorts. downstream signaling pathways were
also inhibited; signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 ( xxxg2216xxx ) was reduced primarily in internal tandem
duplication patients and at late time points in  xxxg801xxx -wt
patients, whereas extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(erk) activity was reduced in the majority of patients,
independent of  xxxg801xxx  inhibition.
conclusions: this novel translational study bridges preclinical models to the patient setting and provides the first
evidence of anti- xxxg801xxx  activity in patients. proof of target
inhibition accomplishes a crucial milestone in the development of novel oncology therapeutics.

introduction
the use of targeted agents such as kinase inhibitors in
oncology has the exciting potential to treat patients based on the
molecular pathology of disease. this poses both an opportunity
and a challenge to gain more information from early clinical
trials, to help guide dosing regimens and patient selection. the
use of pd readouts, to address whether a drug inhibits its target,
and establishment of pk/pd9 relationships in early clinical trials
is a key step in this process.
 xxxg801xxx  is a rtk expressed and activated in the majority of
aml patients and also expressed in some normal hematopoietic
cell types (1–3). two classes of  xxxg801xxx  mutation have been
identified in aml: itd mutations in the juxtamembrane region
domain in 23–25% of patients and point or short length muta-

5466  xxxg801xxx  inhibition by  xxxd3264xxx  in a single-dose aml study

tions in the activation loop of the kinase domain in ⬃7% (4).
both classes of mutation result in constitutive  xxxg801xxx  kinase
activity and transform hematopoietic cell lines (5– 8). in mouse
models,  xxxg801xxx -itd alone is sufficient to induce myeloproliferative disease and cooperates with other molecular lesions to
induce leukemia (9 –11). clinically,  xxxg801xxx -itd is an important
independent negative prognostic factor in aml (12–14) and is
associated with increased blast count, increased relapse rate, and
poor overall survival. the catalytic  xxxd835xxx  point mutation is also
associated with leukocytosis, although the clinical significance
of this mutation is unclear (15).  xxxg801xxx  is, therefore, an attractive
target for the treatment of aml.
 xxxd3264xxx  is an oral multitargeted kinase inhibitor that
inhibits  xxxg801xxx  as well as pdgfr␣, pdgfr␤,  xxxg800xxx ,
 xxxg1274xxx , and kit (16). in preclinical models, we have recently
shown that  xxxd3264xxx  inhibits  xxxg801xxx -itd and  xxxg801xxx - xxxd835xxx , in
addition to  xxxg801xxx -wt (8). in vivo  xxxd3264xxx  dramatically regresses s.c. xenograft  xxxg801xxx -itd tumors and increases survival
in a  xxxg801xxx -itd bone marrow engraftment model (8). pk/pd
analyses in xenograft models showed that target plasma concentrations of 50 –100 ng/ml and 30 –50 ng/ml correlated with
robust inhibition of  xxxg1274xxx , pdgfr␤ or  xxxg801xxx -wt, and
 xxxg801xxx -itd, respectively (16). as one of the first steps in exploratory clinical development of  xxxd3264xxx  in aml, a singledose clinical study was performed to directly evaluate target
activity and establish a pk/pd relationship in humans. aml
provides an ideal indication for such analysis, because peripheral blood can be sampled at multiple time points relatively
noninvasively and  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation can be measured.
analysis of target modulation in solid tumors is technically and
logistically more difficult, particularly at multiple time points.
this study clearly showed that a single dose of  xxxd3264xxx 
inhibits phosphorylation of wild-type and mutant  xxxg801xxx  in the
clinical setting. the inhibition was pk, genotype, and time
dependent. signaling downstream of  xxxg801xxx , via  xxxg2216xxx  and
erk pathways was also inhibited, and decreased blast counts
were observed in several patients. this study provides clinical
proof of target modulation for  xxxd3264xxx . the data generated can
be translated to other  xxxd3264xxx  targets and will help guide
clinical development of  xxxd3264xxx .

materials and methods
patients and treatment regimen
a single-arm, single-dose phase i study of oral  xxxd3264xxx  in
aml was conducted to explore safety and target modulation.
written informed consent was obtained from all patients before
they were enrolled in the study. patients with all aml frenchamerican-british classification types (except aml m3), a
karnofsky performance status of ⱖ60%, and at least 1 million
kit-positive peripheral blood blasts per milliliter were eligible.
patients were required to have adequate hepatic function (defined as serum transaminases ⬍2.5 ⫻ uln or bilirubin ⬍2 ⫻
uln) and adequate renal function (defined as serum creatinine
ⱕ1.5 ⫻ uln or calculated creatinine clearance ⬎40 ml/min) at
study entry. patients could not be taking medications that were
known to have a significant effect on the p450 cyp3a4 pathway.
twenty-nine patients were enrolled at five clinical sites

that were located in the united states and germany. patients
were administered a single dose of  xxxd3264xxx  l-malate capsules
before food ingestion. the starting dose of 50 mg was escalated
in 50-mg increments, with a highest dose of 350 mg.  xxxd3264xxx 
was supplied as 50-, 75-, and 200-mg capsules. interpatient dose
escalation to the next level occurred only if none of three
patients experienced unacceptable toxicity. whole blood was
harvested into edta and heparin anticoagulant vacutainers for
pk and pd (phosphorylation) analysis, respectively, before and
at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, and 48 h after  xxxd3264xxx  administration.
five milliliters of peripheral blood collected (edta anticoagulant) within 14 days of study enrollment were used for  xxxg801xxx 
and kit genotyping.
bioanalytical methods and pk analysis
 xxxd3264xxx  has an active metabolite, su12662. analysis of
 xxxd3264xxx  and su12662 was conducted by liquid chromotograpy-mass spectroscopy-mass spectroscopy by bas analytics (west lafayette, in). internal standards were generated by
extracting human plasma with methanol containing 1 ng/ml
[2h10] xxxd3264xxx . calibration curves were constructed by plotting the ratio of the area of the compounds and the internal
standard against analyte concentration. a weighted linear regression function was used to calculate concentrations of
 xxxd3264xxx  and its active metabolite su12662 in plasma samples.
the primary pk parameters evaluated for  xxxd3264xxx  were cmax
(peak plasma concentration was identified by inspection of
individual subject concentration-time curves), tmax (time of
observed peak plasma concentration was identified by inspection of individual subject concentration-time curves), and auc.
auc0 – 48 h was calculated by noncompartmental methods using
kinetica (version 3.1; innaphase corporation). here, drug
plasma concentration refers to the combined values for
 xxxd3264xxx  and su12662, because they exhibit similar activity.
correlative laboratory analyses
analysis of  xxxg801xxx  and  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation. control experiments were performed to define the optimal processing method for patient peripheral blood to measure rtk phosphorylation. the addition of peripheral blood to lysis buffer,
without enrichment for blasts, was optimal for detection of rtk
phosphorylation by ip/w analysis, as described below.
freshly harvested peripheral blood was added to a 2⫻
volume of lysis buffer [20 mm tris (ph 7.5), 137 mm nacl, 10%
glycerol, 1% np40, 0.1% sds, 2 mm edta, 50 mm naf, 1 mm
na3vo4, 2 mm  xxxd502xxx , 2 ␮g/ml aprotinin, 3.5 ␮g/ml  xxxd3463xxx ,
0.5 ␮g/ml e-64, 0.5 ␮g/ml leupeptin, and 0.7 ␮g/ml pepstatin
a]. lysates were transported on dry ice, stored at ⫺70°c,
thawed at 4°c, and cleared by centrifugation. protein concentration was determined using the bca protein assay (pierce,
rockford, il). approximately 35 mg of lysate from each sample
were immunoprecipitated for  xxxg801xxx  or  xxxg2216xxx , as described
previously (8). phosphorylated  xxxg801xxx  and total  xxxg801xxx  were detected by western blot with 4g10 (upstate biotechnology, lake
placid, ny) and total  xxxg801xxx  (sc-490; santa cruz biotechnology,
santa cruz, ca). data from several groups on  xxxg801xxx  signaling
suggest that  xxxd1075xxx  analysis of  xxxg801xxx  using 4g10 is a
surrogate for  xxxg801xxx  kinase activity (8, 17, 18). in addition,

in vitro experiments using a recently available phospho-specific
 xxxg801xxx  antibody, y591 (cell signaling technologies, beverly,
ma), have shown similar results as  xxxd1075xxx  (4g10).10
phospho- xxxg2216xxx  (y694/y699) and  xxxg2216xxx  antibodies were
from upstate biotechnology and bd biosciences (mountain
view, ca), respectively.
analysis of blood from normal donors by ip/w did not
show significant levels of  xxxg801xxx  expression, most likely because
 xxxg801xxx  expression is restricted to dendritic cells, natural killer
cells, and monocytes in normal peripheral blood, as shown by
rt-pcr and fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis (4). a
number of quality control steps were used for analysis of  xxxg801xxx 
inhibition. first, negative (healthy donor blood) and positive
( xxxg801xxx -expressing leukemia cell line spiked into healthy donor
blood before lysis) controls were processed and analyzed in
parallel with samples from each patient and provided a reference
for interpatient variation. in all cases, controls showed anticipated results; phosphorylated  xxxg801xxx  was not detectable in normal blood, whereas a strong signal was apparent in the positive
control. second, inhibition of  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation was assessed by visual analysis of blots and also by densitometric
quantitation of films to facilitate accurate comparison between
patients. similar results were apparent between methods. when
ip/w analysis was performed in triplicate for patient samples,
⬍10% variation in phosphorylated  xxxg801xxx  relative to total was
apparent. therefore, inhibition was classified as weak or strong
(21–50% and 51–100% decrease in phosphorylation, respectively. finally, to verify that data are within with the linear range
of enhanced chemiluminescence, validation was performed by
comparison of enhanced chemiluminescence with a highdynamic range infrared western blot detection system (licor
odyssey system), which has a large dynamic linear range.
analysis of erk and mek phosphorylation. for analysis of  xxxg1369xxx /2 and  xxxg1361xxx /2 activity, pbmcs were enriched by
 xxxd3253xxx  purification as described (19). activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 and
 xxxg1361xxx /2 were assessed by western blot analysis using phosphoerk1/2 (thr 202/tyr 204) and phospho- xxxg1361xxx /2 (ser 217/
221). phospho-specific and control antibodies were from cell
signaling technologies.
genotype analysis. peripheral blood samples harvested
within 2 weeks of study initiation were genotyped for  xxxg801xxx  and
kit mutations by denaturing high-precision liquid chromatography (wave), as described previously (7).
the primers used for  xxxd835xxx  mutation detected were
5⬘-gcactccaggataatacacatca-3⬘ (forward) and 5⬘-aacgacacaacacaaaatagccg-3⬘ (reverse), with a wave melting temp of
59.1°c. all mutations were confirmed by direct dna sequencing using abi310 sequencer and labeled big dye dideoxy-chain
terminators.

velopment, a single-dose phase i clinical study was performed
in aml patients to address whether  xxxd3264xxx  can modulate
target activity in humans at drug levels that are safely achievable. the primary objective was to assess the degree and duration of  xxxg801xxx  inhibition by  xxxd3264xxx  in aml patients, with a
secondary objective to assess safety, tolerability, and pk of a
single  xxxd3264xxx  dose. because this was a single-dose study,
determination of clinical response was not a study objective and
has been assessed in separate repeat dose studies.
twenty-nine patients were enrolled at five sites, three in
the united states and two in germany. the patient group
comprised 17 males and 12 females, ranging in age from 19 to
82 years (median age, 67), 93% of who had at least one prior
therapy (table 1). patients entered without prior therapy were
considered by their treating physicians to be inappropriate candidates for chemotherapy. each aml patient received a single
dose of  xxxd3264xxx , with three initially recruited to each dose
cohort. if inhibition of  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation was apparent in at
least one patient of three, the cohort was expanded to six
patients to enable more extensive phosphorylation analysis. the
dose was escalated in 50-mg increments from 50 mg to a highest
dose of 350 mg. in each cohort of 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300,
and 350 mg, the number of patients enrolled was three, three,
three, seven, six, six, and one, respectively.
study drug-related adverse events occurred in 31% of
patients. the only drug-related adverse events that were experienced by ⱖ10% patients were diarrhea and nausea (each 10%).
in most cases, this was limited to grade 1 or grade 2 gastroin-

fig. 1 plasma pk of  xxxd3264xxx  in aml patients. plasma was
prepared from patient blood samples harvested before dose and at
4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, and 48 h after  xxxd3264xxx  administration. the
mean cmax (highest plasma concentration; a) and auc (total
exposure; b) are shown for each dose cohort and were dose dependent. c, the mean ⫾ sd of plasma concentration at each time

testinal disorders and only reported at the 250- to 350-mg dose
levels. all other study drug-related adverse events were mild,
infrequent, and dose independent.
two patients had serious adverse events possibly related to
study drug. one 82-year-old male patient with a history that
included hypothyroidism, diabetes, prostate cancer, weight loss,
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia developed a short
episode of grade 3 hypertension the day after receiving a single
200-mg dose of  xxxd3264xxx . this resolved the same day without
sequelae. a second 68-year-old male patient with a history of
hypertension, pericardial effusion with early tamponade, grade 1
atrioventricular block, myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, dyspnea, pulmonary nodules, and
coagulopathy, whose baseline signs and symptoms included
edema, edema lower limb, and cardiac murmur (systolic), developed a transient asymptomatic increase in cardiac ectopy
with a grade 1 ventricular tachycardia on his electrocardiogram
on the same day he received a single 350-mg dose of  xxxd3264xxx .
this rhythm change resolved the following day, and the patient
was discharged from the hospital without sequelae. this event
was classified as a serious adverse event because the patient was
admitted to the hospital for observation. serial electrocardiograms (screen, baseline, and 8, 24, and 48 h after  xxxd3264xxx 
administration) and the changes from baseline for the resting

rate, pr, qrs, qt, and corrected qt intervals were assessed for
all patients. no clinically relevant or consistent changes from
baseline were observed. overall, a single dose of  xxxd3264xxx  was
well tolerated at all dose levels studied. after completing this
study, patients had the option to enter a separate repetitive-dose
phase i study with  xxxd3264xxx  if they qualified for study entry (12
of the patients described entered this study).
pk analysis of plasma drug levels.  xxxd3264xxx  has an
active desethyl metabolite, su12662, which has comparable
activity with the parent compound in biochemical and liganddependent proliferation assays and in vegf-driven vascular
permeability assays in vivo.11 the plasma concentrations of
 xxxd3264xxx  and su12662 were measured at a series of time points
within 48 h after  xxxd3264xxx  administration. a dose-proportional
increase in both cmax and auc for  xxxd3264xxx  was observed with
increasing doses from 50 to 350 mg (fig. 1). similar linearity
was observed with the active metabolite su12662 (10 –15% of
total; data not shown). the combined plasma concentration
curves over time are shown in fig. 1c. across all dose levels,
the tmax was generally observed at 4 – 8 h for both  xxxd3264xxx  and

metabolite. the calculated half-life for  xxxd3264xxx  was 44 ⫾
18.6 h. because of the short sampling period, the terminal
half-life for su12662 could not be determined in this study but
appeared likely to exceed 80 h. moderate intrapatient variability
was observed but, given oral administration, this is not unexpected. these results indicate that a single dose of  xxxd3264xxx 
exhibits dose-dependent pk in humans.
analysis of  xxxg801xxx  genotype and phosphorylation in
predose samples.  xxxg801xxx  genotype analysis was performed in
all patients on entry to the study. the observed incidence of
 xxxg801xxx -itd (exon 14) mutations was 10.3% [3 of 29; vdfreye
(592–598), kyfyvdfre (588 –596), and dfrey (593–597)
in patients 3, 4, and 10, respectively]. the incidence of flt3d835 (exon 20) mutations was 3.4% (1 of 29), observed in
patient 1 (d835y). in addition, a novel activation loop mutation,
g846s (exon 20), was identified in patient 22. patients were
also genotyped for mutations in kit, another  xxxd3264xxx  target.
no mutations were identified in the kit extracellular, juxtamembranen or activation loop region (exons 9, 11, 13, 17),
consistent with the low reported incidence of kit mutations in
adult aml (20).
to measure predose  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation, aml peripheral blood samples were taken before  xxxd3264xxx  administration.
lysates from each patient were immunoprecipitated for  xxxg801xxx 
and analyzed by western blot for phosphorylated and total
 xxxg801xxx  protein. phosphorylated  xxxg801xxx  was evident in predose
samples from 72% of patients (21 of 29). representative data
are shown in fig. 2 (lane 1 of each gel). both the mature (cell
surface) and immature (likely intracellular) forms of  xxxg801xxx  protein, approximately mr 160,000 and mr 135,000, respectively
(2), were detectable in wt and mutant genotypes. in most cases,
both forms were phosphorylated in mutant patients, consistent
with constitutive activity, whereas only the higher mature molecular weight species was phosphorylated in  xxxg801xxx -wt, as
observed in leukemia cell lines (8). it is noteworthy that for the
patient with the  xxxg801xxx -g846s mutation, both  xxxg801xxx  species were
phosphorylated, suggesting that g846s is an activating mutation, rather than a single nucleotide polymorphism. additional
in vitro studies will be needed to assess the transforming potential of this mutant. in the eight patients considered nonevaluable
for  xxxg801xxx  modulation,  xxxg801xxx  protein was detectable but not
phosphorylated (n ⫽ 4), not detectable (n ⫽ 3), or protein was
degraded (n ⫽ 1). for samples in which  xxxg801xxx  protein was not
apparent by ip/w,  xxxg801xxx  expression by flow cytometry staining
on peripheral blood was either negative or low (data not shown).
this analysis showed that phosphorylated  xxxg801xxx  is detectable in
peripheral blood samples from the majority of aml patients,
and 21 were evaluable for analysis of  xxxg801xxx  modulation.
 xxxd3264xxx  treatment inhibited  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation.
analysis of  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation in peripheral blood samples
harvested after  xxxd3264xxx  administration showed strong (⬎50%)
inhibition in both  xxxg801xxx -wt and mutant patients, with strong
inhibition in 12 of 21 evaluable patients. inhibition was
 xxxd3264xxx  dose dependent; 77% (10 of 13) of evaluable patients
who received a 200-mg or higher dose exhibited strong  xxxg801xxx 
modulation, whereas only 25% (2 of 8) of evaluable patients
who received ⬍200 mg showed strong inhibition.  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation data for all patients is summarized in table 2. the
primary study end point of strong inhibition in at least 50% of

patients in a given cohort was reached at 200 mg, in which three
of five evaluable patients showed strong inhibition, and was also
evident in the higher 250-mg and 300-mg dose cohorts. representative examples are shown in fig. 2 and discussed below.
eight of the 16 evaluable wt patients exhibited strong
inhibition of  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation. these were primarily in
higher-dose cohorts, and all evaluable  xxxg801xxx -wt patients who
received ⱖ250 mg showed modulation (table 2). data for two
representative patients are shown (fig. 2, a, b, and f), in which
inhibition was sustained for at least 12 h and 48 h, respectively.
 xxxg801xxx  protein levels did not change over this time period. the
increased phosphorylation at 48 h in patient 13 was also observed in several additional patients (data not shown) and may
reflect  xxxg801xxx  protein turnover and/or decreased plasma drug
levels at later time points.  xxxg801xxx  inhibition was generally more
sustained in patients in the higher-dose cohorts. for example,
the mean percentage of inhibition of  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation at
24 h for patients who received 100, 150, 200, and 250 mg of
 xxxd3264xxx  was 15, 29, 39, and 64%, respectively (minimum, n ⫽
3 per group).
all patients who exhibited strong  xxxg801xxx  inhibition at doses
⬍200 mg were  xxxg801xxx  mutant.  xxxd3264xxx  inhibited  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation in all five  xxxg801xxx  mutant cases. ip/w analysis of
 xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation in itd patients 3 and 10 is shown in
fig. 2, c and d. for patient 3, decreased phosphorylation of
both  xxxg801xxx  species was apparent at 4 – 6 h. inhibition of the
lower, but not upper,  xxxg801xxx  species was sustained to 24 h
(fig. 2f). this patient also exhibited decreased blast counts at
24 and 48 h, indicating that the observed inhibition translated to
biological activity. a similar pattern was apparent in itd patient
4 (data not shown), whereas the third itd patient, 10, who
received a higher dose (200 mg), exhibited comparable inhibition of both  xxxg801xxx  species (fig. 2d). the  xxxg801xxx -g846s patient
(22), received 200 mg of  xxxd3264xxx , and  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation
was strongly inhibited for at least 12 h (fig. 2, e and f). the
 xxxd835xxx  patient in this study (1) showed weak transient inhibition
consistent with low plasma drug levels (cmax, 15 ng/ml; data not
shown). these data clearly demonstrate that a single dose of
 xxxd3264xxx  results in inhibition of  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation in a
dose-dependent manner in aml patients, with inhibition in all
genotypes.
inhibition of  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation was pk-dependent. the pk/pd relationship in humans was assessed by
correlation of  xxxg801xxx  inhibition status with cmax plasma drug
levels for each patient. the plasma cmax levels in  xxxg801xxx -wt
patients who attained strong inhibition of  xxxg801xxx  were significantly different from those who did not show inhibition
[mean ⫾ sd, 133 ⫾ 15 (n ⫽ 8) and 70 ⫾ 8 (n ⫽ 6) ng/ml,
respectively]. given the sustained drug plasma concentrations at values close to the cmax (fig. 1c), inhibition analysis
with auc data was consistent with cmax observations (data
not shown). of the 16 evaluable  xxxg801xxx -wt patients, 7 of 8
(87%) with a cmax ⬎100 ng/ml and only 1 of 8 (13%) with
cmax ⬍100 ng/ml were inhibited (fig. 3a). five  xxxg801xxx -wt
patients had cmax levels from 50 to 100 ng/ml but only one
patient showed strong modulation, suggesting that ⱖ100
ng/ml is required for strong modulation of  xxxg801xxx -wt in most
(87%) cases. in contrast, for  xxxg801xxx -itd patients, phosphorylation was inhibited at a cmax as low as 16 ng/ml, at a mean

fig. 2 analysis of  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation in
aml patients. a–e,  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation
was assessed by ip/w analysis of peripheral
blood harvested before dose and at the indicated time points after  xxxd3264xxx  administration. lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with an anti- xxxg801xxx  antibody. after
sds-page and transfer to nitrocellulose, the
blots were probed with an antiphosphotyrosine antibody (top) and subsequently
stripped and reprobed with an anti- xxxg801xxx  antibody (bottom). inhibition of  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation was assessed by both visual analysis
and densitometric quantitation of western
blots for each patient, and good correlation
was apparent between these methods. f,
western blots were quantitated using quantity
one software, and  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation was
calculated as percentage of predose (%predose), normalized for  xxxg801xxx  protein, for each
time point. points below the dotted line indicate strong inhibition of  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation. data for representative patients are
shown.

cmax of 34 ⫾ 17 ng/ml (n ⫽ 3). these data suggest that a
target plasma concentration of 100 ng/ml is required for strong
inhibition of  xxxg801xxx -wt whereas less is required for inhibition of
 xxxg801xxx -itd. these data are consistent with preclinical results in
which the target plasma drug concentration for modulation of wt
targets was higher (50 –100 ng/ml; ref. 16) than that required for
 xxxg801xxx -itd (30 –50 ng/ml; ref. 8).
the plasma concentration required for sustained  xxxg801xxx  inhi-

bition was also assessed. inhibition of  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation was
sustained for at least 8 h in all modulated  xxxg801xxx -wt patients and
for 24 h in seven of the eight cases. seven of these patients
maintained the target plasma concentration of at least 100 ng/ml for
ⱖ12 h, whereas the eighth patient with sustained inhibition did not
reach 100 ng/ml but maintained 50 ng/ml for 46 h (fig. 3b). this
meets or exceeds biological efficacy requirements defined in repeat
dose experiments with preclinical models, in which inhibition of

strong and weak inhibition are defined as 50 –100% and 20 –50% inhibition of predose phosphorylation, respectively. numbers in parentheses
denote maximum inhibition observed for each patient. for  xxxg801xxx -itd patients, inhibition of both upper and lower  xxxg801xxx  species combined and lower
band only* are shown. itd sequences were vdfreye (592–598), kyfyvdfre (588 –596); and dfrey (593–597) for patients 3, 4, and 10,

target phosphorylation for 8 –12 h in a 24-h dosing period was
associated with tumor regression. these data indicate that maintaining a plasma concentration of ⱖ100 ng/ml is associated with
sustained inhibition of  xxxg801xxx -wt by  xxxd3264xxx .

 xxxd3264xxx  decreased  xxxg2216xxx  activity in a subset of
patients.  xxxg2216xxx  is activated by several rtks and fusion

5472  xxxg801xxx  inhibition by  xxxd3264xxx  in a single-dose aml study

fig. 4 inhibition of  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation by  xxxd3264xxx .  xxxg2216xxx 
phosphorylation was assessed by ip/w analysis of peripheral blood
harvested before dose and at 4, 6, 8, 10,12, 24, and 48 h after  xxxd3264xxx 
administration. lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with an
anti- xxxg2216xxx  antibody. after sds-page and transfer to nitrocellulose,
the blots were probed with an antiphospho- xxxg2216xxx  antibody (top) and
subsequently stripped and reprobed with an anti- xxxg2216xxx  antibody (bottom). data for representative patients are shown.

sufficient to cause myeloproliferative disease (22) and is activated in aml blasts (23–25). we, therefore, assessed  xxxg2216xxx  as
a downstream marker of  xxxg801xxx  signaling. baseline  xxxg2216xxx  tyrosine phosphorylation was detected by ip/w in peripheral
blood samples from 26 of 29 (89%) evaluable patients.  xxxg2216xxx 
protein was also detectable in peripheral blood from healthy
donors, but levels of phosphorylation were undetectable or low
relative to aml patients (data not shown).
 xxxd3264xxx  treatment was associated with decreased  xxxg2216xxx 
activity at one or more time points in the majority of aml
patients in this study. several trends were observed;  xxxg2216xxx 
phosphorylation was markedly decreased (⬎50% inhibition) at
several time points after  xxxd3264xxx  administration in most (four
of five) of the  xxxg801xxx  mutant patients (e.g., patient 10; fig. 4,
top). in  xxxg801xxx -wt patients, two patterns of  xxxg2216xxx  inhibition
were noted. in four cases, primarily at high drug exposure,
inhibition was observed before 24 h and sustained at later time
points (e.g., patient 27; fig. 4). in nine other wt patients,
decreased  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation was apparent only at late
time points (24 and/or 48 h) and, in several cases, was associated with decreased  xxxg2216xxx  protein expression (e.g., patient 17;
fig. 4). a similar decrease in akt phosphorylation and protein
expression was apparent in several patients (data not shown).
this may be a consequence of previous decreases in  xxxg801xxx 
activity or may reflect signaling downstream of other targets of
 xxxd3264xxx . two  xxxg801xxx -wt patients who exhibited strong  xxxg801xxx 
inhibition did not show  xxxg2216xxx  inhibition at any time point,
suggesting that these two pathways are not completely coupled
in  xxxg801xxx -wt patients.

to rule out the contribution of other rtks and blood cell
types to any observed  xxxg2216xxx  inhibition,  xxxg2216xxx  activity in
peripheral blood from solid tumor cancer patients who received
 xxxd3264xxx  in advanced malignancy phase i trials was assessed.
inhibition of  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation was not observed (n ⫽ 10;
data not shown). these data suggest that  xxxd3264xxx  impacts
 xxxg2216xxx  signaling in aml blasts rather than normal blood cells,
consistent with a role for  xxxg2216xxx  in mediating leukemogenic
 xxxg801xxx  signaling.
 xxxg1369xxx /2 and  xxxg1361xxx /2 phosphorylation were inhibited
after  xxxd3264xxx  treatment.  xxxg801xxx  signaling also leads to
phosphorylation and activation of  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx  mitogenactivated protein kinases (3, 5, 7, 23, 24). erk phosphorylation
has been used previously as a marker of rtk signaling in
human skin samples from a clinical trial of the  xxxd1256xxx 
 xxxd2186xxx  in advanced malignancy patients (25). to evaluate
 xxxg1369xxx /2 as a potential marker of target modulation by  xxxd3264xxx ,
blasts were enriched from patient blood samples before dose and
at 24 and 48 h after  xxxd3264xxx  administration.  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation
was assayed by western blot analysis using a phospho-specific
antibody that detects activated  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx . phosphorylated  xxxg1369xxx /2 was evident in predose samples from the majority
of patients (20 of 29, 69%). at 24 or 48 h after  xxxd3264xxx 
administration,  xxxg1369xxx /2 activity was decreased in 16 of the 20
evaluable patients, of which 10 were inhibited at both time
points. examples from two patients with sustained inhibition of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 are shown in fig. 5. no obvious correlation was
apparent between  xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibition and  xxxg801xxx  modulation,
 xxxg801xxx  genotype, or pk.
to further define the  xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling pathway, activation
of  xxxg1361xxx /2, which directly phosphorylates and activates
 xxxg1369xxx /2, was investigated. western blot analysis with a phospho-specific  xxxg1361xxx /2 antibody showed that activated  xxxg1361xxx /2
was detectable in the majority of cases and was inhibited after

fig. 5 inhibition of the mek-erk pathway by  xxxd3264xxx . blasts were
enriched by  xxxd3253xxx  purification from patient blood harvested before and
at 24 and 48 h after  xxxd3264xxx  administration. lysates were prepared and
analyzed by western blot for p-erk and p-mek and subsequently
stripped and reprobed for total erk and total mek. data for representative patients are shown. the patients shown were both  xxxg801xxx -wt, and
each received 150 mg of  xxxd3264xxx .

 xxxd3264xxx  administration in 7 of 18 evaluable patients. in most
patients, p-mek and p-erk showed similar trends, as shown in
fig. 5, in which inhibition of both  xxxg1361xxx /2 and  xxxg1369xxx /2 was
detected. accordingly, a moderate correlation was observed
between changes in  xxxg1361xxx /2 and  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation at 24
and 48 h relative to before dose (r2 ⫽ 0.39 and 0.46, respectively; n ⫽ 19; data not shown). these data suggest that signaling through the ras-raf-mek-erk pathway is decreased
after  xxxd3264xxx  treatment.
decreased blast counts were apparent in several
patients after  xxxd3264xxx  treatment. given that a single dose
of  xxxd3264xxx  inhibits phosphorylation of  xxxg801xxx  and downstream
pathways, patient peripheral blood blast counts were analyzed to
investigate potential biological activity. in most patients, no significant change in blast counts was apparent at 24 or 48 h after
administration of a single dose of  xxxd3264xxx  (mean, 1.19 and
1.08-fold change at 24 and 48 h, respectively, relative to pre-dose;
table 3). however, five patients exhibited large decreases in blast
count (patients 3, 5, 8, 10, 29). of these five, two were  xxxg801xxx -itd
patients, and both exhibited inhibition of  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation
(table 2). three were  xxxg801xxx -wt patients, one who exhibited
strong  xxxg801xxx  inhibition (patient 29); the second was not evaluable
for  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation (patient 5), whereas the third did not
show inhibition but had a weak baseline  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation
signal. these data suggest that  xxxg801xxx  inhibition by a single dose of

 xxxd3264xxx  can translate to reduced blast cell counts and may be
most common in  xxxg801xxx -itd patients. these data link molecular
activity to a biological readout.

discussion
 xxxg801xxx  is a promising target for aml treatment and is
potently inhibited by  xxxd3264xxx  in preclinical models. we conducted an innovative single-dose clinical study to determine the
pk/pd properties of  xxxd3264xxx  in aml patients. this study was
unique in that a pd readout, investigation of target ( xxxg801xxx )
modulation and pk/pd analysis, was the primary end point.
this study extends preclinical observations and demonstrates
inhibition of the  xxxg801xxx  kinase for the first time in humans. the
magnitude and kinetics of  xxxg801xxx  inhibition were dependent on
genotype, dose, and plasma drug levels. overall, inhibition was
seen in 54% of patients, including 87% of  xxxg801xxx -wt patients
who achieved a plasma drug concentration of at least 100 ng/ml.
inhibition of major  xxxg801xxx  downstream signaling pathways was
also apparent;  xxxg2216xxx  was most strongly inhibited in  xxxg801xxx -itd
patients, whereas erk signaling was modulated in the majority
of patients independent of  xxxg801xxx  genotype or modulation. in
addition, decreased blast counts were evident in several patients,
the majority of whom exhibited inhibition of  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation, providing preliminary evidence of biological activity of
 xxxd3264xxx  in aml.
this is the first comprehensive analysis of inhibition of
rtk signaling in a large group of aml patients. successful
collaboration between clinical investigators, the clinical study
team, and the correlative analysis team enabled logistical and
technical challenges in conducting this study to be overcome.
dose-escalation decisions were made based on rapid analysis of
phosphorylation state. acceptable quality lysates were generated from 28 of 29 patients from five international sites, and
most were evaluable for  xxxg801xxx  inhibition. baseline levels of
rtk phosphorylation have not been well described in uncultured human aml samples. we demonstrated that  xxxg801xxx  is
phosphorylated in the majority of aml patients, irrespective of
genotype, consistent with previous data.12 this may be a consequence of high levels of circulating  xxxg801xxx  ligand or potentially
membrane-associated  xxxg801xxx  ligand acting in an autocrine manner on aml blasts, consistent with the role of  xxxg801xxx  ligand in
maintaining blast cell survival (26, 27). this study shows that
pd studies are feasible and can help guide and accelerate
clinical development of new targeted agents.
the pk/pd requirements for  xxxd3264xxx  inhibition of  xxxg801xxx ,
pdgfr␤, and  xxxg1274xxx  in preclinical tumor xenograft models
have been described recently (8, 16). robust inhibition of flt3itd requires a drug plasma concentration of 30 –50 ng/ml, and
wild-type  xxxg801xxx  requires 50 –100 ng/l,11 similar to pdgf and
vegf receptors.  xxxg801xxx -itd also shows increased susceptibility
to inhibition by  xxxd3264xxx  relative to  xxxg801xxx -wt cellular phosphorylation assays (8). the difference in plasma concentration
required to inhibit itd (⬍50 ng/ml) and wt (⬎100 ng/ml) is

5474  xxxg801xxx  inhibition by  xxxd3264xxx  in a single-dose aml study

consistent with these preclinical predictions. it should be noted
that the lower limit for inhibition in itd patients was not
reached, although most itd patients were enrolled in lowerdose cohorts. strong inhibition of  xxxg801xxx -wt phosphorylation
was apparent overall in 50% of patients, in 87% with cmax
⬎100 ng/ml, and not in patients with cmax ⬍50 ng/ml. one
 xxxg801xxx -wt patient with a cmax of 60 ng/ml exhibited strong
inhibition of  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation, sustained for 16 h. interestingly this patient had very high levels of baseline phosphorylation, raising the possibility that higher levels of  xxxg801xxx 
activity may enhance susceptibility to inhibition or may be
technically easier to assay. recording baseline levels of rtk
activity as well as genotype will be important in future studies.
in preclinical xenograft models for pdgfr and vegfr,
daily dosing of  xxxd3264xxx  target inhibition for 12 h is sufficient for full biological efficacy. in aml patients, we observed that  xxxg801xxx  modulation was sustained for longer than
24 h in most patients with a cmax ⬎100 ng/ml. it would be
predicted, therefore, that a  xxxd3264xxx  dosing regimen that
results in a minimal concentration ⬎100 ng/ml would elicit
sustained  xxxg801xxx  inhibition. by extrapolation from preclinical
models, this pk/pd relationship should also translate to
target modulation requirements for pdgfr and vegfr in
patients with solid tumors.
several  xxxg801xxx  inhibitors reduce  xxxg2216xxx  activity in preclinical models (7, 8, 24, 28), but this has not been previously
shown in patients.  xxxg2216xxx  induces myeloproliferative disease
and is activated downstream of many oncogenes associated
with hematopoietic disorders. the levels of  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation in whole blood lysates were higher in aml patients
than in healthy donors or patients with advanced solid malignancies, consistent with recent observations that  xxxg2216xxx  is
active in peripheral blood blasts from the majority of aml
patients (29, 30). data from several groups suggest that
 xxxg2216xxx  is strongly activated by  xxxg801xxx -itd but not by
 xxxg801xxx -wt (5, 7, 23, 24). we observed that stimulation of
 xxxg801xxx -wt cells (the oc1-aml5 cell line or pbmcs isolated
from healthy volunteer blood) with  xxxg801xxx  ligand weakly
activates  xxxg2216xxx  tyrosine phosphorylation and dna binding
activity,13 whereas  xxxg801xxx -itd strongly activates  xxxg2216xxx .
analysis of  xxxg2216xxx  activity after  xxxd3264xxx  administration
revealed inhibition in both wt and mutant patients but most
significantly in itd patients. the inhibition in wt patients
was only at late time points in most cases and may, therefore,
be indirect, reflect weak association of  xxxg2216xxx  signaling with
 xxxg801xxx -wt, or may be downstream of other  xxxd3264xxx  targets
such as kit or vegfrs, which are also expressed on aml
blasts. in future clinical studies with  xxxg801xxx  inhibitors,  xxxg2216xxx 
may provide an additional readout of  xxxg801xxx -itd activity,
analogous to phosphorylation of crkl as a readout of bcrabl signaling in cml (31), and may have application in
analysis of resistance that may arise during treatment with
 xxxg801xxx  inhibitors.
the erk pathway was also modulated by  xxxd3264xxx . because erk is widely expressed and activated by many stimuli in

addition to  xxxg801xxx , activity was measured in pbmcs rather than
peripheral blood used for  xxxg801xxx  analysis. we noted that erk
was inhibited in three patients in whom strong  xxxg801xxx  inhibition
was not detected (data not shown), and in  xxxg801xxx -modulated
patients, a correlation between  xxxg801xxx  and erk inhibition was
not apparent. there are several possibilities to account for this;
because of signal amplification that occurs between  xxxg801xxx  and
erk activation, modest undetectable changes in  xxxg801xxx  phosphorylation may result in larger changes in p-erk, or the
reagents for analysis of p-erk may be more sensitive than
phosphorylated  xxxg801xxx . erk may also be activated downstream
of other  xxxd3264xxx  targets such as kit or vegfrs, which are
also expressed on aml blasts, and is part of many other
signaling pathways that may be indirectly modulated in patients.
in a number of patients, increases in p-erk were apparent after
 xxxd3264xxx  administration (data not shown), which may be associated with sample processing ex vivo.  xxxg1605xxx , which acts
upstream of erk, is mutated in up to 15% of aml patients
(32). because ras signaling may impact sensitivity to  xxxg801xxx 
inhibitors, patients were genotyped for mutations in  xxxg1605xxx 
(exon 1). mutations were identified in two patients (6.9% incidence, g12d and g12a, respectively; data not shown). correlation with erk activity was not feasible with this small sample
size.
erk activity has also been used as a downstream biomarker of target inhibition in patient pbmc samples from a
farnesyl transferase inhibitor phase i trial in aml (33) and in
skin biopsies from advanced malignancy patients treated with
 xxxd2186xxx  (25, 34). taken together, it seems that erk may be
a general readout of targeted therapies that impact proliferation signaling in clinical samples. additional studies are
needed to investigate erk as a specific biomarker of  xxxg801xxx 
signaling.
this clinical study provided rapid and direct evidence of
 xxxg801xxx  target modulation by  xxxd3264xxx  in cancer patients. evidence of inhibition of downstream signaling through the  xxxg2216xxx 
and erk pathways was also clear but was more difficult to
interpret, most likely because of redundancy among signaling
pathways. therefore, in this study, direct analysis of  xxxg801xxx 
provided the most valuable correlative information. the pk/pd
relationship was consistent with preclinical data and can be
applied to other solid tumor targets of  xxxd3264xxx . this proof of
target inhibition in a clinical setting validates and guides additional clinical development of  xxxd3264xxx , which is currently in
phase i and ii clinical trials.
