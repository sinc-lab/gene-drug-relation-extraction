abstract
this study directly tested the hypothesis that the induction of oocyte maturation in the catfish clarias batrachus is
followed by a transient decrease in oocyte  xxxd1773xxx  (camp) level that is due to an increase in phosphodiesterase
(pde) activity. further, the pde inhibitor  xxxd3344xxx  was used to investigate the possible role of pde in the
maturation-inducing action of 17a,20b-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17a,20b-dp), the physiological maturation-inducing
steroid of this catfish species. the results obtained from batches of oocytes taken from the same donor at the same time
clearly show a close relationship between dose-dependent induction of germinal vesicle breakdown (gvbd) and pde
activity with a concomitant decrease in camp in the oocytes treated with different concentrations of 17a,20b-dp. in
contrast,  xxxd3344xxx  prevents gvbd and inhibits pde activity by promoting camp accumulation in oocytes. a timedependent decrease in pde activity and an increase in camp content with a marked inhibition of gvbd were recorded
even in oocytes pre-stimulated with 1 mgyml 17a,20b-dp for 6 h and then treated with 1 mm  xxxd3344xxx  for various
times. these results suggest that camp plays a key role in the regulation of oocyte maturation in c. batrachus which
may be mediated by pde activity.

1. introduction
in teleosts, oocyte maturation is triggered by the
direct action of steroids secreted by the follicle in
response to gonadotropin. one particular steroid,
17a,20b-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17a,20bdp) has been shown to be most effective for
inducing oocyte maturation in vitro in a wide
variety of teleosts including the catfish, clarias
batrachus (reviews goetz, 1983; scott and canario, 1987; jalabert et al., 1991; nagahama et al.,

1994; haider, 1997). this steroid has been identified in the culture medium after gonadotropin
stimulation as the naturally occurring physiologically active maturation-inducing steroid (mis) in
a salmonid fish (nagahama and adachi, 1985)
and catfish (haider and rao, 1992).
a few studies on the mechanism of action of
17a,20b-dp in the regulation of oocyte maturation
in fish have shown that  xxxd1773xxx  (camp) plays
an important role as an intraoocyte regulator of
maturation (reviewed in jalabert et al., 1991). the
importance of camp in the regulation of oocyte
maturation was first suggested by the ability of
phosphodiesterase (pde) inhibitors such  xxxd79xxx   xxxd1710xxx -

isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine ( xxxd2388xxx ) and 1,3dimethyl-xanthine ( xxxd3344xxx ) to inhibit
progesterone (considered as the mis)-induced
oocyte maturation in amphibia (o’connor and
smith, 1976; bravo et al., 1978). subsequent
studies showed significant decreases in intraoocyte
camp levels after progesterone treatment of
oocytes from amphibians (speaker and butcher,
1977; schorderet-slatkine et al., 1977). a similar
decrease in oocyte camp has been observed in
fish following 17a,20b-dp stimulation or during
the induction of oocyte maturation (jalabert and
finet, 1986; finet et al., 1988; haider and chaube,
1995). pde inhibitors such as  xxxd2388xxx ,  xxxd3344xxx 
or sq 20,006 that presumably elevate intra-oocyte
camp levels also inhibit 17a,20b-dp-induced
maturation in fish (demanno, 1983; goetz and
hennessy, 1984; jalabert and finet, 1986; demanno and goetz, 1987; chaube and haider,
1995; haider and chaube, 1996).
previously, we showed that in c. batrachus
17a,20b-dp-stimulated
oocyte
maturation
involves a decrease in camp (haider and chaube,
1995); however, the adenylyl cyclase activator
 xxxd1742xxx  or  xxxd2388xxx  (a pde inhibitor) countered
this effect and promoted the accumulation of
camp in the oocytes (haider and chaube, 1996).
in a separate study, chaube and haider (1997)
further demonstrated that pde inhibitors ( xxxd2388xxx 
and  xxxd3344xxx ) inhibit pde activity previously
stimulated by 17a,20b-dp in the oocytes of c.
batrachus. from these data it can be presumed
that oocyte maturation in c. batrachus involves a
decrease in camp in response to 17a,20b-dp that
can at least in part be accounted for the inhibition
of adenylyl cyclase andyor stimulation of pde
activity. apparently, this presumption seems to be
quite reasonable but many points remain obscure
or controversial. for instance, in these studies
catfish oocytes were stimulated with 1 mgyml
17a,20b-dp and then treated with different doses
of pde inhibitors. however, it could not be established from these studies whether pde inhibitors
were able to inhibit pde activity and oocyte
maturation without 17a,20b-dp stimulation. further, the effect of different doses of 17a,20b-dp
and pde inhibitors on camp level, pde activity
and germinal vesicle breakdown (gvbd) on
oocytes from the same donor were not investigated
at the same time in any fish species including the
catfish, c. batrachus. therefore, the present investigation is aimed to monitor camp concentration,

pde activity and gvbd after treating the oocytes
with different doses of 17a,20b-dp and the pde
inhibitor  xxxd3344xxx . in addition, an attempt is
also made to show that pde inhibitors block
17a,20b-dp-induced oocyte maturation in c.
batrachus by promoting the accumulation of
camp in oocyte which may be due to inhibition
of pde activity.
2. materials and methods
2.1. chemicals
17a,20b-dp,  xxxd2388xxx ,  xxxd3344xxx , edta and
 xxxd3449xxx  were purchased from sigma chemical
company, usa. anion-exchange resin (dowex1x4, chloride-form, bio-rad, richmond, ca, usa)
and snake venom (naja naja kaouthia) were kind
gifts of dr catherine c. allende (casilla, santiago,
chile) and dr deepak mitra (calcutta, india),
respectively. w3hxcamp (specific activity, 1900
mciymmol) was obtained from bhabha atomic
research centre (mumbai, india) and purified by
column separation on dowex1-x4 (1:4 parts h2o;
2 ml slurryycolumn). w3hxcamp was eluted with
5 ml 0.05 n hcl and the column was washed
repeatedly with 20 ml of water (ph 5.0). all other
chemicals used were of analytical grade and
obtained either from e. merck or glaxo, india.
2.2. animals and collection of oocytes
gravid female c. batrachus were obtained from
local suppliers in juneyjuly and maintained in the
laboratory until use. full-grown immature oocytes
were isolated mechanically from ovaries and kept
in freshly prepared catfish incubation medium (for
medium see upadhyaya and haider, 1986).
17a,20b-dp was dissolved in filtered ethanol to
obtain stock solution of 100, 10, 1 and 0.1 mgyml
from which 0.01 mlyml incubation medium was
added to achieve 1, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 mgyml
concentrations, respectively. thus, the final ethanol
concentration in the medium during culture was
1%, which was also added in control incubation.
 xxxd3344xxx  was dissolved in sterilized incubation
medium as a 10 mm stock solution. maturational
processes were assessed by immersing the oocytes
in a clearing solution (5% formalin and 4% acetic
acid in the incubation medium), enabling easy
microscopic examination of the occurrence of
gvbd. only post-vitellogenic, folliculated

s. haider / comparative biochemistry and physiology part a 134 (2003) 267–274

oocytes with centrally located gv were selected
for the experiments.
2.3. in vitro incubations
groups of 60–70 full-grown but immature folliculated oocytes were placed in sterilized culture
vials containing 3 ml of medium. three different
experiments were conducted and for each experiment, control oocytes were kept separately. all
incubations were maintained in triplicate for 36 h
at 23"2 8c. at the end of incubations, 20–22
oocytes were taken out for camp and pde assays,
and the remaining oocytes were placed in clearing
solution to determine the rate of gvbd.
the first experiment was conducted to see the
effect of different doses of 17a,20b-dp on oocyte
camp concentration, pde activity and on the rate
of gvbd. the second experiment was planned to
observe the effect of various concentrations (0.5,
1, 1.5 and 2 mm) of  xxxd3344xxx  on oocyte camp,
pde activity and gvbd. a third experiment was
conducted to observe the effect of time of addition
of  xxxd3344xxx  on 17a,20b-dp-induced oocyte
camp content, pde activity and gvbd. all of
the oocytes of this experiment were first stimulated
for 6 h with 1 mgyml 17a,20b-dp. results of
preliminary experiment indicated that this dose
and time were sufficient to induce maturation.
oocytes were then treated with 1 mm  xxxd3344xxx 
for various times (0–2, 0–4, 0–6, 0–12, 0–24
and 0–36 h) and maintained in medium for the
remaining period (except the last incubation,
which was maintained for 42 h).
2.4. preparation of oocyte extract and camp assay
samples for camp assay were prepared following the protocol of jalabert and finet (1986) with
slight modification. briefly, 15–16 oocytes were
homogenized in 5 ml of extraction medium, prepared as for in vitro incubation medium, but
buffered with tris (50 ml) and adjusted to ph 5.7
with hcl.  xxxd3344xxx  (2 mm) was added to
block pde activity. each tube was rinsed with a
further 5 ml of extraction medium, which was
added to corresponding homogenized oocytes in
15-ml glass tubes. these tubes were rapidly vortexed and centrifuged for 15 min at 4000=g at 4
8c. two milliliters of intermediate phase (lying
between the pellet and the floating lipids) from
each sample was added to 1 ml edta (0.04 m)

269

and 1 ml hcl (0.8 m) in a 5-ml glass tube. after
vortexing, the tubes were placed in a boiling water
bath for 3 min, cooled on ice and centrifuged to
eliminate the denatured protein. the supernatant
was neutralized with excess of caco3, and the
tubes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature.
finally, caco3 was removed by centrifugation,
and the supernatant was stored in microcentrifuge
tubes at y20 8c until subsequent assay.
camp was quantified using camp ria kits
obtained from nen, dupont, boston, usa. samples were diluted with assay buffer provided with
the kit. diluted samples (100 ml) were acetylated
with 5 ml acetylation reagent. acetylated samples
were reacted with 100 ml working tracer and 100
ml antibody complex followed by 16–18 h incubation at 2–8 8c. incubation was terminated by
adding 500 ml precipitator. after centrifugation at
1200=g at 4 8c for 10 min, supernatant was
decanted and tubes containing dry pellets were
counted in a beckman dp 5500 gamma counter.
levels of total camp (follicular cellsqoocyte)
were calculated as pmoly100 ml of the sample
which were then converted into pmolyoocyte after
multiplying with the dilution factor. the sensitivity
of assay was in the range of 0.05–4.0 pmol of
camp. the intra- and inter-assay coefficients of
variation derived from 3 assays were 5.2% and
8.4%, respectively.
2.5. preparation of oocyte extract and pde assay
oocyte extracts for each sample were prepared
by homogenizing five oocytes in 50 mm hepes
(ph 0.7) and 1 mm mgcl2 in a final volume of
50 ml (after allende et al., 1977). the extracts
were stored below 0 8c until all experimental
samples were collected.
the assay for the measurement of pde activity
is similar to the method of allende et al. (1977)
and uses a modification of the thompson and
appleman (1971) procedure. briefly, oocyte
extracts (50 ml for each sample) were incubated
for 10 min at 30 8c after adding 0.2 mci of
w3hxcamp. the reaction was stopped by adding 5
ml of 0.1 n hcl. the w3hxcamp is hydrolyzed to
59-amp. the 59-amp was then further hydrolyzed
to adenosine by the addition of 50 ml of 0.5 mgy
ml snake venom (59-nucleotidase) followed by 10
min incubation at 30 8c. methanol (0.5 ml) was
added to each sample to stop the hydrolysis before
centrifugation at 3000=g for 10 min at 4 8c. half

270

a milliliter of supernatant from each sample was
passed over dowex1-x4 column (1:4 parts methanol; 2 ml slurryycolumn). samples were eluted
directly into scintillation vials containing 5 ml
toluene-triton x-100 (30%) cocktail. the anionexchange resin binds all charged nucleotides and
leaves w3hxadenosine as the only labeled compound to be counted. the product formation was
quantified in a beckman ls 1801 liquid scintillation counter and pde activity was expressed as
fmol w3hxadenosine producedyminyoocyte.
2.6. statistical analysis
results are presented as the mean"standard
error of mean (s.e.m.) of three replicate incubations. statistical analysis of data consisted of either
student’s t-test or one- or two-way analysis of
variance (anova) followed by newman–keuls’
test. to avoid individual variation, only one donor
was used for each experiment.
3. results
3.1. effect of 17a,20b-dp on gvbd percentage,
oocyte camp level and pde activity
when fully-grown, but immature folliculated
oocytes having centrally located germinal vesicle
were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of 17a,20b-dp for 36 h, a significant
decrease in camp level with a marked stimulation
of pde activity and a concomitant increase in the
percentage of gvbd (fig. 1) was recorded. at its
highest concentration (1 mgyml), 17a,20b-dp not
only induced 90.41"2.94% gvbd and stimulated
pde activity to 1052.0"18.91 fmolyoocyteymin
from 495.67"10.16 fmolyoocyteymin (control),
but also decreased camp level to 0.7"0.1 pmoly
oocyte from 2.9"0.2 pmolyoocyte. these results
clearly indicate that the induction of oocyte maturation by 17a,20b-dp is followed by a decrease
in oocyte camp via an increase in pde activity.
3.2. effect of  xxxd3344xxx  on gvbd percentage,
oocyte camp and pde activity
the effect of various doses of  xxxd3344xxx  on
oocyte camp content and pde activity are shown
in fig. 2. the mean level of camp concentration
in control oocyte was 1.7"0.3 pmolyoocyte.
increasing concentrations of  xxxd3344xxx  elevated

camp contents at all the dose levels in comparison
to control. the highest  xxxd3344xxx  concentration
(2 mm) increased the camp level to 20.7"0.6
pmolyoocyte. in comparison to the control
(496.67"10.16 fmolyoocyteymin),  xxxd3344xxx 
significantly (p-0.001) inhibited pde activities
at all doses. however, no significant change in
gvbd percentage was noted in oocytes exposed
to various doses of  xxxd3344xxx  under non-stimulated conditions (data not given).
3.3. effect of time of  xxxd3344xxx  addition on
gvbd, camp level and pde activity in oocytes
stimulated with 17a,20b-dp
to evaluate the possibility that pde inhibitor
may inhibit the stimulatory response of 17a,20bdp on oocyte pde activity via an increase in
oocyte camp content, oocytes of this experiment
were treated first with 1 mgyml 17a,20b-dp for
6 h (stimulatory control) and then incubated with
the effective dose (1 mm) of  xxxd3344xxx  for
various times (2, 4, 6, 12, 24 and 36 h) and
gvbd percentage, camp levels and oocyte pde
activities were recorded (fig. 3). in oocytes stimulated with 1 mgyml 17a,20b-dp for 6 h, the
gvbd percentage was found to be 21.1"1.5, the
camp content was 3.2"1.32 pmolyoocyte and
the pde activity was 866.0"5.25 fmolyoocytey
min. when  xxxd3344xxx  was given after 6 h of
17a,20b-dp stimulation, a significant increase in
camp concentration and decrease in pde activity
at all the time points with a marked inhibition of
gvbd was recorded after 4 h of  xxxd3344xxx 
treatment (fig. 3). these results clearly indicate
that 17a,20b-dp-induced oocyte maturation is
inhibited by blocking pde activity which in turn,
is involved in the accumulation of camp in catfish
oocyte.
4. discussion
in fish oocytes the induction of oocyte maturation by 17a,20b-dp (mis) is accompanied by an
initial decrease in camp levels (jalabert and finet,
1986; finet et al., 1988; haider and chaube, 1995;
haider and baqri, 2000). conversely, an increase
in camp is associated with the inhibition of
17a,20b-dp-induced oocyte maturation in fish.
arguments favoring this hypothesis have been
provided by the observation that pde inhibitors
such as  xxxd2388xxx ,  xxxd3344xxx  or sq 20,006 which

presumably elevate intraoocyte camp also inhibit
17a,20b-dp-induced gvbd in vitro (demanno,
1983; goetz and hennessy, 1984; jalabert and
finet, 1986; demanno and goetz, 1987; chaube
and haider, 1995; haider and chaube, 1996;
haider and baqri, 2000). in addition,  xxxd2388xxx  (a
pde inhibitor) have indeed been found to increase
camp levels in 17a,20b-dp-stimulated oocytes
of rainbow trout, salmo gairdneri (now oncorhynchus mykiss) (jalabert and finet, 1986) and catfish, c. batrachus (haider and chaube, 1996).
it is possible that the initial decrease in camp
level of oocytes in response to 17a,20b-dp may

be caused by an increase in pde activity, whereas
an increase in oocyte camp in response to pde
inhibitors may be due to a decrease in pde
activity. in pursuing this possibility, chaube and
haider (1997) demonstrated the stimulation of
pde activity in oocytes treated with 17a,20b-dp
and further showed the inhibition of pde activity
in 17a,20b-dp stimulated oocytes of c. batrachus
treated with different doses of  xxxd2388xxx  and  xxxd3344xxx . however, they did not show the ability of
any inhibitor to inhibit 17a,20b-dp-induced
gvbd in which the inhibition of pde activity
was observed with the accumulation of camp in

oocyte of same donor at the same time. furthermore, in these studies catfish oocytes were first
treated for 2 h with  xxxd2388xxx  or  xxxd3344xxx  and
then they were incubated in the presence of 1 mgy
ml 17a,20b-dp after which the pde activity was
measured. however, the ability of  xxxd2388xxx  or  xxxd3344xxx  to inhibit pde activity in oocytes without 17a,20b-dp stimulation could not be
established from these studies. the present study
shows that different doses of  xxxd3344xxx  inhibit
pde activity in oocytes of catfish that had not
been stimulated by 17a,20b-dp. this finding further demonstrates that  xxxd3344xxx  not only inhibited pde activity, but also promoted camp
accumulation in oocytes. the resulting accumulation of camp in the oocytes caused insignificant
change in gvbd in the  xxxd3344xxx  groups. similar observations have also been made in the
experiment in which oocytes were first stimulated
by 1 mgyml 17a,20b-dp for 6 h and then treated
with effective dose (1 mm) of  xxxd3344xxx  for
various times (fig. 3). on the other hand, various
doses of 17a,20b-dp stimulated pde activities
and decreased camp concentrations that finally
culminate in gvbd (fig. 1) in c. batrachus
oocytes.
from the above discussion it now appears most
likely that in catfish camp play an important role
as an intraoocyte regulator of maturation and this
could be mediated by the degradative activity of
camp pde which catalyzes the conversion of
camp to 59-amp. however, in amphibians this
regulation that results primarily from progesterone
(mis) action at the membrane level appears to be
mainly due to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity (sadler and maller, 1981, 1985; finidori-lepicard et al., 1981; jordana et al., 1981). sadler and
maller (1987) demonstrated that  xxxd2388xxx  and  xxxd3344xxx  inhibit the basal pde activity in oocytes
of xenopus laevis in a dose-dependent manner and
correlated this inhibition with the ability of each
drug to inhibit progesterone-induced gvbd. later,
they showed that progesterone alone has no effect
on pde activity in x. laevis oocytes, but a low
dose of progesterone in combination with insulin
or insulin-like growth factor 1 (igf-1) accelerated
oocyte pde activity greater than that observed in
response to insulin or igf-1 alone (sadler and
maller, 1989). thus, in amphibians, it appears that
some stimulation of cytoplasmic pde activity may
occur, at least when maturation is induced by
factors such as insulin or igf-1 (review jalabert

273

et al., 1991). the lack of direct effect of progesterone on pde activity in x. laevis is probably
due to potentiation of peptide action by progesterone. in contrast, the experiments performed in the
present study with 17a,20b-dp (a progesterone
derivative identified as the mis in catfish) point
to a remarkable coincidence in the induction of
gvbd, stimulation of pde activity and the
decrease of camp content in c. batrachus oocytes.
in summary, the results obtained from batches
of oocytes taken from same donor at the same
time clearly indicate the ability of 17a,20b-dp to
induce oocyte maturation by stimulating pde
activity which in turn may be involved in the
decrease of camp content in oocytes of the catfish,
c. batrachus. on the other hand,  xxxd3344xxx 
inhibited pde activity and promoted camp accumulation in oocytes leading to failure of gvbd.
thus, the regulation of camp levels by 17a,20bdp or pde inhibitor is concerted and most certainly plays a key role in the oocyte maturation in
the catfish, c. batrachus.
