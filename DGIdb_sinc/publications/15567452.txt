abstract
background: the ability to administer low molecular weight heparins (lmwh)
subcutaneously without laboratory monitoring contributes to their popularity for the
treatment of thrombotic disorders. subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, although
less expensive, is deemed to require routine laboratory monitoring on the basis of
more variability in drug effect compared to lmwh. however, the more predictable
pharmacokinetic profiles of low molecular weight heparins are largely based on antixa activity, while antithrombin activity may be at least as important to their
mechanisms of action.
methods: we performed a clinical pharmacokinetic trial to compare the variability in
peak antithrombin effect between subcutaneous unfractionated heparin and various
lmwhs, all given in recommended weight-adjusted treatment doses. sixty-one
patients enrolled in a warfarin clinic were randomized to receive one of four
different weight-adjusted subcutaneous heparin doses: unfractionated heparin, 250
units/kg (n=15);  xxxd3379xxx , 175 units/kg (n=15);  xxxd1805xxx , 200 units/kg (n=15); or
enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg (n=16). the areas under the curves of antithrombin levels
during the first 3 h after administration were determined for each patient, and the
coefficients of variation and 95% confidence intervals of the aucs were compared
among the treatment groups.
results: there was no statistically significant difference in the coefficients of
variation of antithrombin effect between unfractionated heparin (52.8, 95% ci:
32.6—72.9) and enoxaparin (56.5, 95% ci: 35.7—77.4) or  xxxd1805xxx  (43.5, 95% ci
25.4—61.6).  xxxd3379xxx  had statistically significant decrease in coefficients of

variation (21.6, 95% ci: 12.2—30.9) relative to unfractionated heparin,  xxxd1805xxx 
and enoxaparin.
conclusions: lmwhs, as a class of drugs, are no more predictable in antithrombin
effect after subcutaneous injection than unfractionated heparin. there were
considerable differences among lmwhs in the observed variability of antithrombin
effects, with  xxxd3379xxx  being somewhat more predictable than the other drugs
tested.

introduction
subcutaneous low molecular weight heparins have
become increasingly popular for the treatment of
venous thromboembolic disease and other disorders [1]. both subcutaneous unfractionated heparin and subcutaneous low molecular weight
heparin have been demonstrated to be safe and
effective for venous thromboembolism treatment.
subcutaneous  xxxd1997xxx  has
the significant practical advantage that most
clinical uses do not involve plasma monitoring,
which is routinely performed for unfractionated
heparin [2]. the different requirements for plasma
monitoring between the two drug types have
never been tested in comparative trials. current
recommendations for different monitoring requirements are based in part on the belief that
subcutaneously administered low molecular
weight heparins are associated with more predictable pharmacokinetic profiles than those of subcutaneous unfractionated heparin. the parameter
typically used to compare the pharmacokinetics of
the two drug types has been the potency for
catalyzing the inhibition of unbound  xxxg741xxx  in
plasma (anti-xa activity). however, since the
mechanism of action for both drugs involves
thrombin inhibition as well as  xxxg741xxx  inhibition,
potency for inhibiting thrombin (antithrombin
activity) may be an appropriate parameter for
comparing these drugs.
inhibition of thrombin (antithrombin activity) has
been proposed as the major action of both unfractionated and low molecular weight heparins [3].
animal experiments suggest that the antithrombotic
potencies of unfractionated heparin and of low
molecular weight heparins correlate more highly
with plasma antithrombin activity than with plasma
anti-xa activity [4,5]. in clinical trials, anti-xa
activity did not correlate well with antithrombotic
effect or bleeding risk [6] in patients given low
molecular weight heparins. for these reasons, the
pharmacokinetic bsuperiorityq of any subcutaneous
heparin preparation may depend on its ability to

achieve a low level of variability in antithrombin
activity when administered to a variety of patients.
we performed a randomized clinical trial to
determine if several types of subcutaneous low
molecular weight heparin have more predictable
pharmacokinetics than subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, with respect to their antithrombin
activities. we compared the variability in plasma
antithrombin levels measured serially in patients
who had received the recommended treatment
doses of unfractionated heparin or one of the low
molecular heparins available in the united states:
enoxaparin,  xxxd1805xxx  or  xxxd3379xxx .

materials and methods
patient population
subjects were recruited from participants in a
clinical study (to be published separately) determining the effect of subcutaneous heparins on
prothrombin time measurements in patients taking
warfarin. (warfarin should have no effect on the
primary pharmacokinetic variables measured in the
current study.) inclusion criteria for the parent
study were as follows: warfarin administration for
at least 6 weeks, no oral contraceptives, no known
sensitivity to heparin and no use of heparin for at
least 12 h prior to the study. patients were
excluded from the current study only if plasma
sampling did not include all time points necessary
for pharmacokinetic analysis (see below).
the veterans administration medical center,
loma linda california institutional review board
approved the project. informed consent was
obtained from all human subjects.

drug administration and blood sample
collection
patients were randomly assigned to receive one of
the following four medications subcutaneously:

pharmacokinetics of uh and lmwh are similar with respect to antithrombin activity
enoxaparin (1 mg/kg);  xxxd3379xxx  (175 units/kg);
 xxxd1805xxx  (200 units/kg); or unfractionated heparin
(250 units/kg). these dosages reflected the initial
subcutaneous dose of each medication currently
recommended for the treatment of venous thromboembolic disease [1]. the patients were then
observed for 4 h thereafter.
blood samples were drawn prior to administration
of the medication, and then 1 and 3 h afterwards.
this interval encompasses the peak levels and peak
biological activities of both unfractionated heparin
and  xxxd1997xxx  after subcutaneous administration [7]. blood was drawn from a
fresh venipuncture site into a vacutainer tube
containing 0.1 volume of 3.8% buffered citrate
solution. immediately after the blood draw, plasma
was obtained by centrifugation at 2500g for 15 min
at 4 8c. the samples were coded so that individuals
performing plasma assays (see below) were blinded
to patient id, treatment type and sampling time.
the plasma was stored at 70 8c and shipped on dry
ice to a central testing laboratory.

plasma antithrombin activities
all samples were coded in order to blind the
investigators to the treatment groups and time
points. plasma antithrombin activity assays were
performed on the samples using a commercially
available kit (american diagnostica, greenwich,
ct) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
briefly, for each treatment group, heparin (and
lmwh) standards were prepared in normal pooled
human plasma using heparin from the same lots
as were administered to the patients. the
antithrombin activity of each medication was
based on published findings [3]. diluted patient
plasma or heparin standard was mixed with
 xxxg2056xxx  and incubated for 2 min at room
temperature. then, bovine thrombin was added
and the incubation continued for exactly 2 min,
followed by addition of a thrombin-specific
chromogenic substrate. the change in absorbance
at 405 nm was monitored in a vmax kinetic
microplate reader (molecular devices, sunnyvale,
ca) for 1 min. all assays were performed in
duplicate. the antithrombin activities of patient
plasma samples were interpolated from the
standard curve.

variance, with a bonferroni test for multiple comparisons. the gender and primary diagnoses were
compared using a chi-square test for independence.
in all cases, p values of less than 0.05 were
designated as indicating significant difference
among groups. after all plasma assays were completed and the results were documented, the
laboratory team was informed of the treatment
group, patient id and time point for each measured
sample. the results were analyzed by a separate
statistical team who were kept blinded to the type
of medication administered to each treatment
grouped.
the aim of the study was to compare the
variability in drug activity between unfractionated heparin and the low molecular weight
heparins when administered subcutaneously.
therefore the primary outcome used to compare
the treatment groups was the inter-patient variability in the area under the curve of antithrombin activity (aucat) from 0 to 3 h after
subcutaneous injection. a significant difference in
variability was defined as non-overlapping 95%
confidence intervals of the coefficient of variation in aucat values. the coefficients of variation (cv), as well as 95% confidence intervals
(ci), were calculated as previously described [8].
briefly, probability plots were generated using
minitab v 13 (minitab, state college, pennsylvania) and graphically assessed to determine if
aucat values approximated a normal distribution
within each treatment group. next, the cv of
each group was defined as:
cv ¼ 100s=xbarð1 þ 1=ð4nþþ
where s is the standard deviation, xbar is the
mean aucat value, and n is the sample size. the
standard error of the cv (secv) was defined as:
secv ¼ ð1 þ 1=ð4nþþcv=sqrtð2nþ:
the 95% confidence interval of cv was defined
as:
95%

ci of cv ¼ ðcv  t  secv; cv þ t  secvþ

where t is the critical value from a t distribution
with n1 degrees of freedom and level a/2.

discussion

figure 2 variabilities in plasma antithrombin levels
after subcutaneous injection of heparin and lmwh. the
coefficients of variation in antithrombin levels were
calculated for each group of patients after each patient
received a single, subcutaneous dose of either unfractionated heparin (250 units/kg),  xxxd3379xxx  (175 units/kg),
 xxxd1805xxx  (200 units/kg) or enoxaparin (1.0 mg/kg).
error bars represent the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval associated with each coefficient of
variation. with the exception of  xxxd3379xxx , there was
no statistically significant difference in antithrombin
variabilities between these heparins when administered
as described.

noses. all subjects completed the entire study and
there were no adverse outcomes.
the antithrombin activities measured in
patients within each medication group are presented in fig. 1. the meanfstandard deviation of
the auc for antithrombin levels in the 3 h after
drug injection was 0.49f0.27 for enoxaparin,
1.29f0.27 for  xxxd3379xxx , 0.96f0.41 for  xxxd1805xxx  and 0.34f0.18 for unfractionated heparin.
the lower plasma activities for unfractionated
heparin and for enoxaparin were due to the fact
that the dose administered (following clinical
recommendations [1]) represented half of the
daily dose, rather than the entire daily dose, as
was the case for  xxxd3379xxx  and  xxxd1805xxx .

variabilities in antithrombin levels
the variabilities in antithrombin levels among the
medications are represented in fig. 2. unfractionated heparin was no less predictable than two of
the three low molecular weight heparins. the cv
of unfractionated heparin (52.8, 95% ci: 32.6—
72.9) was not significantly different than the cv of
enoxaparin (56.5, 95% ci: 35.7—77.4) or the cv for
 xxxd1805xxx  (43.5, 95% ci 25.4—61.6). however, the
cv of  xxxd3379xxx  (21.6, 95% ci: 12.2—30.9) was

the plasma antithrombin levels of patients treated
with subcutaneous btreatment dosesq of enoxaparin
and  xxxd1805xxx  are no more predictable than those
given unfractionated heparin. subcutaneous  xxxd3379xxx  had more predictable antithrombin levels
than unfractionated heparin,  xxxd1805xxx  and enoxaparin. these results suggest that low molecular
weight heparins, as a class of drugs, have no more
predictable dose—response relationships than
unfractionated heparins. in fact, enoxaparin, the
most frequently used  xxxd1997xxx 
in the united states, had a slight trend toward
higher variability than unfractionated heparin.
interestingly, the standard deviation of body
weights in the unfractionated heparin group was
the largest in the study (twice the value in the
enoxaparin group and nearly three times the value
in the  xxxd3379xxx  group). despite this chance
occurrence, the pharmacokinetics of unfractionated heparin were just as predictable as enoxaparin and  xxxd1805xxx .
the clinical relevance of the pharmacokinetic
comparisons reported here depends on the (controversial) topic of the mechanisms of action of
heparin and  xxxd1997xxx . it is well
established that subcutaneous low molecular
weight heparins result in more predictable anti-xa
levels than does subcutaneous unfractionated heparin. however, the antithrombotic potency of low
molecular weight heparins does not correlate well
with their plasma anti-xa activities. [6,9,10].
although the currently available assays used for
pharmacokinetic comparisons measure only inhibition of free  xxxg741xxx , the mechanisms of action of
uh and lmwh are much more complicated [11]. it is
unknown whether their actual antithrombotic activities parallel the results of their anti-xa assays,
their antithrombin assays or some combination of
both. since both uh and lmwh preparations are
heterogenous in terms of size, composition, and
clearance of their constituent molecules, it is
plausible that the molecules tracked by any particular assay are not identical to the ones causing the
greatest antithrombin-mediated thrombus inhibition. [12]. previous works by our laboratory [4] and
others [5] suggest that antithrombin activity may
play a prominent role in the ability of heparins (both
unfractionated and low molecular weight) to inhibit
thrombus propagation in vivo. the pharmacokinetic
bsuperiorityq of low molecular heparins, as a class of

50
drugs, compared to unfractionated heparin was not
apparent when considering antithrombin activity in
these experiments.
the findings presented here may have important
implications for how thromboembolic disease is
treated clinically. some clinical analyses have
suggested that therapeutic monitoring (using aptt)
may be unnecessary for subcutaneous unfractionated heparin [13,14], just as it is for low
molecular weight heparin. the data in this report
suggest that the major biological effect (antithrombin activity) of fixed dose subcutaneous unfractionated heparin is just as predictable as those of
most subcutaneous low molecular weight heparins.
the fact that a heparin formulation was of low
molecular weight did not appear to bestow a higher
degree of pharmacokinetic predictability than that
of unfractionated heparin.
the antithrombin activity of subcutaneous  xxxd3379xxx  did appear to be more predictable than
those of enoxaparin,  xxxd1805xxx  and of unfractionated heparin. however, the  xxxd3379xxx  group also
had the narrowest range of body weights. this
factor could have contributed to the predictability
of response. however, it is interesting to note that,
whereas most thromboembolism treatment trials
disclosed no significant difference in outcome
between subcutaneous  xxxd1997xxx  and intravenous unfractionated heparin [15—
26], one clinical trial reported significantly better
outcomes with subcutaneous  xxxd3379xxx  than with
intravenous unfractionated heparin [27]. whether
these observations translate into better clinical
outcomes with subcutaneous  xxxd3379xxx  than with
other low molecular weight heparins or with
(unmonitored) subcutaneous unfractionated heparin needs to be addressed in comparative clinical
trials.
the comparisons made in these experiments are
somewhat limited by the fact that the low molecular
weight heparins we used differ from each other and
from unfractionated heparin in their recommended
dosing intervals, and therefore in the fraction of the
daily dose given at any one time. therefore, there
was no uniform dosing interval for measuring the
auc of antithrombin activity that would have been
appropriate for all of the different medications. for
this reason, we chose to measure the antithrombin
activities in the first 3 h after drug injections, which
would encompass previously published peak activities. using this technique, we determined the
predictability of each drug’s bioavailability after
subcutaneous injection. although the half-lives of
the drugs were not measured in this study, previously
published clinical trials suggest that the half-lives of
each subcutaneously administered drug [7,28—33]

t.a. morris et al.
are appropriate for the dosing recommendations
followed in this study [1].
we observed in these experiments that the
bioavailability of subcutaneous unfractionated heparin is no less predictable than the bioavailability of
most low molecular weight heparins, with respect
to antithrombin activity: a major biological effect
of both drugs. our results did not suggest a rationale
for the clinical practice of monitoring subcutaneous
unfractionated heparin, but not subcutaneous low
molecular weight heparins. whether the more
predictable pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3379xxx  result
in clinical benefits over the other medications
tested can only be determined by comparative
outcome trials.
