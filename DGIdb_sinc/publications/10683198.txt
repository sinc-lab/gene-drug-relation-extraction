1 the actions of 13 general anaesthetics ( xxxd2052xxx , en¯urane, iso¯urane, methoxy¯urane,
sevo¯urane, chloral hydrate, tri¯uoroethanol, tribromoethanol,  xxxd3319xxx , chloretone, brometone,
trichloroethylene, and a-chloralose) were studied on agonist-activated cl7 currents at human
gabaa a2b1, glycine a1, and gabac r1 receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells.
2 all 13 anaesthetics enhanced responses to submaximal (ec20) concentrations of agonist at
gabaa and glycine receptors, except a-chloralose, which did not enhance responses at the glycine
 xxxg81xxx . none of the anaesthetics studied potentiated gaba responses at the gabac r1
receptor.
3 potentiation of submaximal agonist currents by the anaesthetics was studied at gabaa and
glycine receptors harbouring mutations in putative transmembrane domains 2 and 3 within gabaa
a2, b1, or glycine  xxxg81xxx  subunits: gabaa a2(s270i)b1, a2(a291w)b1, a2b1(s265i), and
a2b1(m286w); glycine a1(s267i) and a1(a288w). for all anaesthetics studied except a-chloralose, at
least one of the mutations above abolished drug potentiation of agonist responses at gabaa and
glycine receptors.
4 a-chloralose produced ecacious direct activation of the gabaa a2b1 receptor (a `gabamimetic' eect). the other 12 anaesthetics produced minimal or no direct activation of gabaa and
glycine receptors. a non-anaesthetic isomer of a-chloralose, b-chloralose, was inactive at gabaa
and glycine receptors and did not antagonize the actions of a-chloralose at gabaa receptors.
5 the implications of these ®ndings for the molecular mechanisms of action of general anaesthetics
at gabaa and glycine receptors are discussed.

introduction
g- xxxd2177xxx  type a (gabaa) and glycine receptors
are the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the
vertebrate central nervous system. ligand-gated ion channels
have emerged as strong molecular candidates to mediate the
eects of general anaesthetics (franks & lieb, 1994; harris et
al., 1995; krasowski & harrison, 1999). gabaa receptor
function is allosterically enhanced by a wide range of
chemically diverse anaesthetic compounds at clinically relevant
concentrations. these include halogenated volatile ethers and
alkanes (nakahiro et al., 1989; wakamori et al., 1991; jones et
al., 1992), n-alcohols (nakahiro et al., 1991; dildy-may®eld et
al., 1996), chloral derivatives (lovinger et al., 1993; peoples &
weight, 1994), propofol (hales & lambert, 1991), etomidate
(belelli et al., 1997), the barbiturates (thompson et al., 1996),
and a-chloralose (garrett & gan, 1998). strychnine-sensitive
glycine receptors are positively modulated by volatile ether and
alkane anaesthetics (wakamori et al., 1991; harrison et al.,

1993; downie et al., 1996), n-alcohols (mascia et al., 1996),
and chloral derivatives (pistis et al., 1997; krasowski et al.,
1998a), but are much less sensitive to barbiturates, propofol,
and etomidate (koltchine et al., 1996; mascia et al., 1996).
gabaa and glycine receptors are both part of a ligandgated ion channel gene superfamily that also includes the
serotonin3, gaba r (`gabac') and nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors. the gabaa receptor is a heteromeric complex
assembled from dierent glycoprotein subunits (a1 ± 6, b1 ± 4, g1 ± 4
d, e, p) which combine to form a chloride channel (reviewed by
barnard et al., 1998). gabaa receptors in vivo probably
consist in general of pentameric complexes of a, b, and g
subunits with a stoichiometry of 2a: 2b: 1g (chang et al., 1996;
farrar et al., 1999). gabaa receptors lacking the g subunit
(ab receptors) can be studied in heterologous expression
systems and retain sensitivity to general anaesthetics and nalcohols (pritchett et al., 1989; harrison et al., 1993; mihic et
al., 1994a,b). gabaa ab receptors are very useful for
molecular pharmacology studies, as they reduce the number
of subunits to consider.
native glycine receptors consist either of homomeric
assemblies of a subunits, or of heteromeric complexes of a

732

m.d. krasowski & n.l. harrison

and b subunits, which assemble in vivo with a proposed
stoichiometry of 3a : 2b (kuhse et al., 1995). glycine a
subunits, which contain the agonist binding sites, can also be
expressed in heterologous systems as functional receptor
complexes. these homomeric glycine a receptors are sensitive
to allosteric modulation by alcohols and general anaesthetics
(harrison et al., 1993; mascia et al., 1996) and have proven to
be very helpful for molecular pharmacology studies.
in contrast to gabaa receptors, `gabac' receptors
assembled from r1 ± 3 subunits (cutting et al., 1991) are
insensitive to ether anaesthetics (harrison et al., 1993; mihic
& harris, 1996). n-alcohols inhibit gaba-mediated currents
at the gabac r1 receptor (mihic & harris, 1996).
speci®c amino acid residues within putative transmembrane
domains (tm) 2 and 3 have been shown to be critically
important for the positive modulatory actions of en¯urane
(mihic et al., 1997), iso¯urane, propofol (krasowski et al.,
1998b), n-alcohols (mihic et al., 1997; wick et al., 1998; ueno
et al., 1999), and etomidate (belelli et al., 1997; mcgurk et al.,
1998) at gabaa and glycine receptors. in this study, we
examined whether mutations within tm2 and  xxxg2318xxx  of
gabaa and glycine receptors alter sensitivity to a panel of
13 general anaesthetics, including ethers, alkanes, primary and
tertiary alcohols, and a-chloralose. we also compared the
potentiation of agonist responses produced by the anaesthetics
at gabaa and glycine receptors with their anaesthetic
potencies in vivo.
some of the results presented here have been reported
previously in preliminary form (krasowski et al., 1998c).

methods
site-directed mutagenesis of receptor cdna
the gabaa a2 (hadingham et al., 1993a), b1 (hadingham et
al., 1993b), gabac r1 (cutting et al., 1991), and glycine a1
(grenningloh et al., 1987) receptor subunit cdnas are all of
human origin. preparation of the s270i and a291w mutations
of the gabaa a2 subunit, the s265i and m286w mutations of
the gabaa b1 subunit, and the s267i and a288w mutations
of the glycine a1 subunit has been described in detail elsewhere
(krasowski et al., 1998a,b).

cell culture and transfection of receptor cdnas
wild-type or mutated receptor cdnas were expressed via the
vector pcis2 which contains one copy of the strong promoter
from cytomegalovirus and a polyadenylation sequence from
sv40. human embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells (american
type culture collection, rockville, md, u.s.a.) were
maintained in culture on glass coverslips and transfected with
the appropriate cdnas by the calcium phosphate precipitation method to achieve transient expression (harrison et al.,
1993; krasowski et al., 1998a).

electrophysiological recordings
hek 293 cells were used for electrophysiological experiments
2 ± 5 days following cdna transfection. recordings were
performed at room temperature using the whole-cell patch
clamp technique (harrison et al., 1993; krasowski et al.,
1998a). the extracellular medium contained (in mm): nacl
145, kcl 3, cacl2 1.5, mgcl2 1, d-glucose 5.5 and hepes 10,
ph 7.4, osmolarity 320 ± 330 mosmol. the electrode solution
contained (in mm): n-methyl-d-glucamine hydrochloride 145,
british journal of pharmacology, vol 129 (4)

general anaesthetics, gaba a and glycine receptors

k2atp 5, hepes/koh 5, mgcl2 2, cacl2 0.1 and egta 1.1,
ph 7.2, osmolarity 315 mosmol. pipette-to-bath resistance was
4 ± 6 mo. cells were voltage-clamped at 760 mv.
all drugs were rapidly (550 ms exchange time) applied to
the cell by local perfusion (koltchine et al., 1996; krasowski et
al., 1997) using a motor-driven solution exchange device (bio
logic rapid solution changer rsc-100; molecular kinetics,
pullman, wa, u.s.a.). laminar ¯ow was maintained by
applying all solutions at identical ¯ow rates via a multi-channel
infusion pump (stoelting, wood dale, il, u.s.a.). the
solution changer was driven by protocols in the acquisition
program pclamp5 (axon instruments, foster city, ca,
u.s.a.). responses were digitized (tl-1-125 interface; axon
instruments) using pclamp5 and stored for o-line analysis.
throughout this study, potentiation by the various general
anaesthetic agents was always assessed with test concentrations
of agonist that correspond to the ec20 value on the
concentration-response curve for the particular receptor under
study (i.e., the concentration of agonist that produces 20% of
the maximal response to agonist). detailed concentrationresponse curves for agonist alone were determined for each
receptor combination, in order to control for dierences in
agonist sensitivity between dierent receptors. at the end of
each potentiation experiment, a maximal agonist response was
elicited by an appropriately high concentration of agonist. the
test concentration of agonist was adjusted as appropriate if the
responses diered signi®cantly from 20% of the maximal
agonist response. as in previous studies (krasowski et al.,
1998a,b), the average percentage of maximal agonist responses
for the test concentrations used did not dier signi®cantly from
20% for any of the receptor combinations studied.

data analysis
anaesthetic-induced `potentiation' of an agonist-induced
current was de®ned as the percentage increase of the control
agonist response (de®ned as the average of the pre-drug and
post-drug agonist induced currents). concentration response
data were ®tted (kaleidagraph; reading, pa, u.s.a.) with
the hill equation: i/imax=[a]nh ([a]nh+[ec50]nh)71, where
[a]=concentration of anaesthetic, i/imax=percentage of the
maximum obtainable response, ec50=concentration producing a half-maximal response, and nh=hill coecient. pooled
data are presented throughout as mean+s.e.mean. statistical
signi®cance was determined by one-way analysis of variance
with dunnet's post-hoc test, unless stated otherwise.

drugs
stock solutions of gaba, glycine (sigma chemical co., st.
louis, mo, u.s.a.), and anaesthetic compounds were diluted
into extracellular solution each day before use. the sources of
the anaesthetics (see figure 1 for chemical structures) were as
follows: chloral hydrate, trichloroethylene, 1,1,1-trichloro-2methyl- xxxd2400xxx 
(chloretone),
2,2,2-trichloroethanol
(tcet), 2,2,2-tri¯uoroethanol (tfet) [sigma]; methoxy¯urane
(metofane1) [mallinckrodt veterinary, inc., mundelein, il,
u.s.a.];  xxxd2052xxx  [j.t. baker, inc., phillipsburgh, nj,
u.s.a.]; b-chloralose, 2-methyl- xxxd2400xxx  ( xxxd3319xxx ) [aldrich chemical co., milwaukee, wi, u.s.a.]; a-chloralose,
2,2,2-tribromoethanol (tbret) [fluka, ronkonkoma, ny,
u.s.a.]; 1,1,1-tribromo-2-methyl- xxxd2400xxx  (brometone)
[sigma-aldrich rare chemicals library, milwaukee, il,
u.s.a.]; sevo¯urane (ultane1) [abbott laboratories, north
chicago, il, u.s.a.]; iso¯urane (forane1) [ohmeda caribe,
inc., guayama, puerto rico]; and en¯urane (ethrane1)

[anaquest caribe, inc., guayama, puerto rico]. chloretone,
a-chloralose, b-chloralose, tbret, and brometone were ®rst
prepared as stock solutions in dimethyl sulphoxide (sigma)
before being dissolved in the extracellular medium. the
maximum ®nal concentration of dimethyl sulphoxide was
0.1% (v v71), which was determined during carrier control
experiments to have no signi®cant eect on agonist-induced
currents in the receptor constructs analysed in this study.

preparation of volatile anaesthetic solutions and
determination of anaesthetic concentrations by gas
chromatography
volatile anaesthetic solution preparation and gas chromatography measurements were adapted from methods previously
described (jones et al., 1992). all volatile anaesthetic solutions
were prepared by injection of pure liquid anaesthetic with
gastight syringes (hamilton, reno, nv, u.s.a.) into
evacuated intravenous drip bags containing de®ned volumes
of extracellular solution. the nature of the local perfusion
method used to apply solutions during electrophysiological
recordings precluded direct determination of the concentration
of volatile anaesthetic solutions reaching a cell during patchclamp recording. consequently, a series of control experiments
were undertaken to estimate the amount of volatile agents
( xxxd2052xxx , en¯urane, iso¯urane, methoxy¯urane, sevo¯urane, and trichloroethylene) lost prior to cellular perfusion.
losses of volatile anaesthetics from aqueous solution in our
experiments can result only from escape of the anaesthetic

from the intravenous drip reservoirs, or from manipulations
involved in the local perfusion application. to address the ®rst
concern, anaesthetic solutions were prepared in the intravenous drip bags and left for up to 4 h. at various time-points,
solutions were withdrawn for later chromatographic analysis.
to determine losses resulting from the perfusion method,
anaesthetic solutions were loaded into syringes and perfused
through the catheter tubing exactly as during electrophysiological recordings. the euent ¯owing out of the solution
changer head was immediately withdrawn for analysis.
all samples destined for gas chromatography analysis
consisted of 100 ml of aqueous anaesthetic solution injected
into a 2 ml septum-capped autosampler vial (wheaton,
millville, nj, u.s.a.). for gas headspace chromatography
analysis on a sigma 2000 gas chromatogram (perkin-elmer,
norwalk, ct, u.s.a.), the gas phase (100 ml) above the sample
was injected (1008c) onto a 2.74 m long 5% se-30 packed
column (ohio specialty chemical, marietta, oh, u.s.a.;
1108c) and detected by ¯ame ionization (1108c) with n2 as the
carrier gas (10 ± 20 ml min71 ¯ow rate). analysis of trichloroethylene solutions required higher column (2008c), detector
(2008c), and oven temperatures (1758c) for optimal detection.
peak heights from the gas chromatograph output were used to
quantify concentrations, and experimental concentrations were
determined by comparison with peak heights from standard
samples.
the control experiments demonstrated that losses of
volatile agents were, for the most part, small (510% total
losses) and would minimally in¯uence the pharmacology

experiments. the agents requiring special attention were
 xxxd2052xxx , trichloroethylene, and en¯urane. following 4 h
in the intravenous drip bags, roughly 20% of the trichloroethylene, en¯urane, and  xxxd2052xxx  solutions were lost. for
these agents, the losses were much less at 2 h or shorter
(55%); consequently, during actual electrophysiological
experiments, fresh aqueous solutions of  xxxd2052xxx ,
trichloroethylene, and en¯urane were prepared every 2 h.
with these added precautions for trichloroethylene, diethyl
ether, and en¯urane, loss in the intravenous drip bags should
be 55 ± 10% for all agents for the pharmacology data
presented in this study. loss due to perfusion was substantial
for both  xxxd2052xxx  (52.1+7.6% loss, 16 control experimental trials) and trichloroethylene (35.2+7.4% loss, 19
trials). concentrations of  xxxd2052xxx  and trichloroethylene
referred to in this study are adjusted to re¯ect this perfusion
loss.

clinically relevant concentrations of the general
anaesthetics
clinically relevant concentrations for the various anaesthetic
compounds were derived to facilitate comparison with the
potencies of the anaesthetics in potentiating agonist
responses at gabaa and glycine receptors. immobility, a
lack of purposeful response to a noxious stimulus, was
considered here to represent the anaesthetic endpoint, and
represents an easily determined and consistent endpoint
across a large variety of dierent animal species. for some
of the anaesthetic compounds, previous studies have
determined accurate ec50 plasma concentrations for the
agents in producing immobility in mammals. these include
the volatile anaesthetics (see below), along with a-chloralose
(nattel et al., 1990) and tcet (garrett & lambert, 1973),
for which studies have assayed ec50 plasma concentrations
following intravenous administration (see table 1).
the most commonly used measure of volatile anaesthetic
potency in vivo is minimum alveolar concentration (mac), the

general anaesthetics, gaba a and glycine receptors

partial pressure of volatile anaesthetic required to produce
immobility in response to a noxious stimulus in 50% of trials
(eger et al., 1965). mac values for the various volatile agents
were averaged from a range of dierent mammalian studies.
mac values (in partial pressures) were ®rst converted into
aqueous concentrations using the appropriate saline/gas
partition coecients after which temperature corrections were
then applied to the aqueous concentrations to obtain average
aqueous mac equivalents at 208c (franks & lieb, 1993;
1996). average aqueous mac equivalent values for diethyl
ether, en¯urane, iso¯urane, methoxy¯urane, and sevo¯urane
have been reviewed by krasowski & harrison (1999) (see
table 1). mac values for trichloroethylene (allott et al., 1973;
halsey, 1980) and tfet (eger et al., 1999) were obtained from
published studies (see table 1).
for the remaining compounds, no published studies have
reported ec50 concentrations for anaesthesia. the anaesthetic
potencies for these compounds were therefore determined by
using the loss of righting re¯ex assay in xenopus laevis
tadpoles.

determination of anaesthetic potencies for loss of
righting re¯ex in tadpoles
general anaesthetic in vivo potencies were determined for
xenopus laevis tadpoles (xenopus 1, ann arbor, mi, u.s.a.)
in the pre-limb-bud stage of development, corresponding to
stages 43 ± 50 of the standard nomenclature for xenopus laevis
development (nieuwkoop & faber, 1956). tadpoles were
maintained in de-chlorinated tap water in an aerated aquarium
at room temperature.
the assay for loss of righting re¯ex in tadpoles has
historically been a very popular assay for determining the in
vivo potency of general anaesthetics (downes & courogen,
1996). the anaesthetic endpoint of loss of righting re¯ex, a
measure of immobility, is de®ned as a lack of purposeful
and sustained swimming response after a gentle inversion
with a smooth glass rod (downes & courogen, 1996;

tomlin et al., 1998). during randomized blind experiments,
approximately ten tadpoles were placed in each of a number
of beakers containing 300 ml of tap water, with or without
the addition of anaesthetic compounds. except for a tap
water control, all beakers contained 0.1% dimethyl
sulphoxide to control for the highest dimethyl sulphoxide
concentration that would be present in any beaker. no
anaesthetic actions or mortality were ever observed at 0.1%
dimethyl sulphoxide or lower. the number of anaesthetized
tadpoles was recorded every 10 min until equilibrium was
reached, after which the tadpoles were returned to fresh tap
water, where recovery was monitored. equilibrium with
respect to loss of righting re¯ex was usually reached within
80 min, except for a-chloralose which required approximately 4 h to reach equilibrium.
tadpole concentration-response data were ®tted to a
quantal analysis equation of the form p=(100* in)
[in+(ec50)n]71 where p is the percentage of the population
anaesthetized, i is the anaesthetic concentration, n is the
slope factor, and ec50 is the concentration for a halfmaximal anaesthetic eect (waud, 1972). quantal analysis
used software written by dr andrew jenkins (cornell
university).

anaesthetic compounds (figure 1) at these two receptors
were assessed on responses to ec20 concentrations of
agonist. figures 2 and 3 show representative examples of
potentiation of agonist responses by sevo¯urane, methoxy¯urane, and chloral hydrate at gabaa a2b1 and glycine a1
receptors. figure 4a shows a representative example of achloralose potentiating submaximal gaba responses at the
gabaa a2b1 receptor. in contrast to the ethers and
alcohols, a-chloralose did not potentiate glycine-mediated
currents at glycine a1 receptors (figure 4c).
complete concentration-response curves for potentiation
of agonist responses by the anaesthetics were constructed by
assessing the eects of at least ®ve anaesthetic concentrations on submaximal agonist currents. figure 5 illustrates
concentration-response curves for potentiation of agonist
responses by sevo¯urane,  xxxd2052xxx , chloral hydrate, and

general anaesthetics, gaba a and glycine receptors

the gabaa a2b1 receptor did not exceed 10 ± 15% of the
maximal gaba current. direct activation of glycine a1
receptors by the anaesthetics was usually absent, although
some of the anaesthetics directly activated glycine receptors
with maximal magnitudes less than 5 ± 10% of the maximal
glycine response, similar to previous reports (see figure 3;
downie et al., 1996). other than a-chloralose (figure 4a,b; see
below), direct activation of gabaa and glycine receptors by
the anaesthetics was not studied in detail.
a `rebound' current is evident following washout of 5 mm
sevo¯urane in experiments with the gabaa a2b1 receptor
(figure 2a, arrow). this phenomenon has been reported
previously in studies of potentiation of gaba-mediated
currents by sevo¯urane in hippocampal neurons (wu et al.,
1996), and also has been observed in studies of several other
general anaesthetics at gabaa receptors (robertson, 1989;
adodra & hales, 1995; banks & pearce, 1999). the rebound
current is believed to re¯ect rapid relief of low-anity
anaesthetic block of gaba-induced current (robertson,
1989; wu et al., 1996; banks & pearce, 1999). rebound
currents were also observed following washout of high
concentrations of other general anaesthetics at the gabaa
a2b1 receptor (e.g., a-chloralose, chloral hydrate; data not
shown). rebound currents were never observed at the glycine
 xxxg81xxx , indicating that they are receptor-speci®c.
figure 4 a-chloralose produces potentiation of gaba responses
and direct activation at the gabaa a2b1 receptor, yet inhibits
submaximal glycine responses at the glycine  xxxg81xxx . (a) achloralose potentiates current responses to ec20 concentrations of
gaba at the gabaa a2b1 receptor. direct activation is evident
during the pre-application of 50 and 200 mm a-chloralose. (b) achloralose directly activates the gabaa a2b1 receptor. the ®rst four
traces are for a-chloralose applied in the absence of any gaba in the
perfusion system. the response to a maximal concentration of
gaba (500 mm) is shown for comparison. note the slow time course
of the a-chloralose-mediated currents. (c) a-chloralose, at concentrations greater than 100 mm, inhibits current responses to ec20
concentrations of glycine (gly) at the glycine  xxxg81xxx . traces
shown are individual recordings from hek 293 cells transfected with
cdnas encoding the gabaa a2 and b1 receptor subunits (a,b) or
the glycine  xxxg81xxx  subunit (c).

glycine responses (figures 4c and 5d).
table 1 summarizes the anaesthetic eects on submaximal
agonist responses at gabaa a2b1 and glycine a1 receptors.
the anaesthetics generally had a higher potency for
potentiation of agonist responses at gabaa a2b1 than at
glycine a1 receptors. a-chloralose and tfet were the only
anaesthetics which did not potentiate submaximal glycine
responses at glycine a1 receptors. tfet potentiated gabamediated currents although with weak ecacy (approximately 35% potentiation of responses to ec20 concentrations of gaba); no eect of tfet was noted on
submaximal currents at glycine a1 receptors at tfet
concentrations up to 100 mm (table 1).

direct activation and blocking eects by the anaesthetics
at gabaa a2b1 and glycine a1 receptors
a small degree of direct activation (i.e., a gaba-mimetic
eect) is noticeable during anaesthetic pre-application in some
of the current traces at the gabaa a2b1 receptor in figure 2.

lack of potentiation of agonist responses by the general
anaesthetics at gabac r1 receptors
the gaba concentration-response curve for the wild-type
human gabac r1 receptor expressed in hek 293 cells has
been previously published (krasowski et al., 1998a). none of
the anaesthetic compounds studied produced potentiation of
gaba responses or direct activation at gabac r1 receptors
(table 2). in fact, some anaesthetics inhibited gaba
responses.  xxxd2052xxx  (50 mm), tfet (20 mm), and chloral
hydrate (10 mm) each produced signi®cant inhibition of ec20
gaba responses at the gabac r1 receptor (p50.05; table
2).

eects of mutations within tm2 and  xxxg2318xxx  of gabaa
and  xxxg904xxx  subunits on anaesthetic potentiation
of agonist responses
anaesthetic potentiation of agonist responses was evaluated in
four gabaa and two glycine receptors with mutations in
tm2 or  xxxg2318xxx  of individual receptor subunits: gabaa
a2(s270i)b1, a2(a291w)b1, a2b1(s265i), and a2b1(m286w);
glycine a1(s267i) and a1(a288w). detailed agonist concentration-response data for these mutated gabaa and glycine
receptors have been reported previously (krasowski et al.,
1998a,b). figure 6 illustrates the actions of three volatile either
anaesthetics (methoxy¯urane, sevo¯urane, and  xxxd2052xxx )
at the gabaa a2(s270i)b1, a2(a291w)b1, and a2b1(s265i)
receptors. concentrations of methoxy¯urane, sevo¯urane, and
 xxxd2052xxx  that produced substantial potentiation of gabamediated currents at wild-type gabaa a2b1 receptors (c.f.,
figures 2a,b and 5a,b) had no eect on gaba responses at
gabaa a2(s270i)b1 and a2(a291w)b1 receptors (figure
6a,b). in contrast, potentiation of gaba responses by these
three volatile anaesthetics at the gabaa a2b1(s265i) receptor
was similar to that at the wild-type gabaa a2b1 receptor
(figure 6c).

13 anaesthetics studied at wild-type and mutated gabaa a2b1
receptors. previously published data for iso¯urane, propofol

glycine a1 receptors. note the lack of eect of a-chloralose at the glycine  xxxg81xxx  at concentrations 40.1 mm with inhibition of
glycine responses evident at 0.2, 0.5, and 1 mm. see table 1 for ec50, hill slope, emax, and ncells values.

(krasowski et al., 1998b), and tcet (krasowski et al., 1998a)
has been included in figure 7 for comparison. for all the
anaesthetics tested except a-chloralose, at least one of this
group of mutations abolished the potentiation of gaba
responses at gabaa a2b1 receptors.
we also tested the actions of the anaesthetics at glycine
a1(s267i) and a1(a288w) receptors. figure 8 demonstrates that
the glycine a1(a288w) receptor was insensitive to positive
modulation by all anaesthetics tested. in contrast, all ®ve ether
anaesthetics potentiated submaximal glycine responses at the
glycine a1(s267i) receptor, while most of the halogenated and
non-halogenated alcohols failed to potentiate glycine responses

at this receptor. the eects of en¯urane on the mutated gabaa
and glycine receptors analysed in this study have been previously
described for receptors expressed in xenopus laevis oocytes
(mihic et al., 1997); the results presented here for receptors
expressed in hek 293 cells are qualitatively similar.

1989). no direct activation by a-chloralose was detected at
either glycine a1 (see figure 4c; n=6 ± 11) or gabac r1
receptors (n=5) at concentrations up to 2 mm. a-chloralose
directly activated gabaa a2b1 receptors with an ec50 of
0.12+0.01 mm (nh=3.6+0.4, emax=66+2.3% of the maximal gaba response, n=6). the direct activating eects of achloralose were mediated via the gabaa receptor, as the achloralose-induced current was blocked by the gabaa
receptor antagonist  xxxd2947xxx . application of 10 mm  xxxd2947xxx  blocked 89.0+2.2% of the current elicited by 200 mm achloralose at the wild-type gabaa a2b1 receptor (n=4). achloralose also directly activated all four mutated gabaa
receptors with ec50 values similar to that for the wild-type
gabaa a2b1 receptor (n=5 ± 7 for all experiments): gabaa

(ec50=0.11+0.02 mm,
emax=35+1.6%).
a structural isomer of a-chloralose, b-chloralose (see
figure 1), possesses almost no sedative/hypnotic, anticonvulsant, or general anaesthetic activity (monroe et al.,
1963a,b). b-chloralose produced no loss of righting re¯ex in
tadpoles, even when applied at saturating concentrations for
up to 24 h.
b-chloralose did not produce potentiation of agonist
responses or direct activation of gabaa a2b1 receptors,
glycine a1, or gabac r1 receptors (tables 1 and 2). at
gabaa a2b1 receptors, 100 mm b-chloralose produced
72.4+3.9% alteration of an ec20 gaba response (n=4)
with no direct activation evident even with applications up
to 3 min (n=4). further, 100 mm b-chloralose did not
antagonize potentiation of gaba responses or direct
receptor activation by 100 mm a-chloralose at wild-type
gabaa a2b1 receptors. potentiation of an ec20 concentration of gaba by 100 mm a-chloralose was 87.6+14.3%
(n=13) and 83.9+18.4% (n=6) in the absence and presence
of pre- and co-application of 100 mm b-chloralose. direct
activation of wild-type gabaa a2b1 receptors by 100 mm achloralose was 19.9+2.1% (n=13) and 18.9+4.0% (n=7)
of the maximal gaba current in the absence and presence
of pre- and co-application of 100 mm b-chloralose. thus, bbritish journal of pharmacology, vol 129 (4)

anaesthetic potency of chloral hydrate is not possible in
mammals, because chloral hydrate is very rapidly metabolized
to tcet (marshall & owens, 1954; garrett & lambert, 1973).
drug metabolism is inecient in tadpoles (brodie & maickel,
1962), so presumably very little chloral hydrate is converted to
tcet.

discussion
relevance to general anaesthesia
the results of this study demonstrate a qualitative correlation
between the potencies of the general anaesthetics for potentiat-

ing gaba responses at gabaa a2b1 receptors and the in vivo
potencies of these agents for producing immobility in mammals
or loss of righting re¯ex in tadpoles. the potencies of the
anaesthetics for potentiating glycine responses at the glycine a1
receptors correlated less impressively with the in vivo anaesthetic
potencies, primarily because a-chloralose and tfet did not
potentiate glycine responses at the glycine  xxxg81xxx . the
results presented here and in other studies suggest that the
 xxxg904xxx  is most sensitive to ether, alkane, and alcohol
anaesthetics, but is much less sensitive or insensitive to other
anaesthetic agents such as etomidate, barbiturates, propofol, achloralose, and steroidal anaesthetics (prince & simmonds,
1992; koltchine et al., 1996; mascia et al., 1996; pistis et al.,
1997).

general anaesthetics, gaba a and glycine receptors

figure 8 summary of the eects of mutations in tm2 or  xxxg2318xxx  of the glycine  xxxg81xxx  subunit on potentiation of submaximal
glycine currents by (a) ethers, (b) primary alcohols along with the alkane trichloroethylene, and (c) tertiary alcohols. the ordinate
depicts percentage change of a control response to an ec20 concentration of glycine by co-application with anaesthetic. the amount
of potentiation produced by an anaesthetic at a given mutated receptor was compared to the corresponding potentiation produced
at the wild-type glycine  xxxg81xxx . *, **, or *** indicates that the amount of potentiation at the mutant receptor was dierent from
that at the wild-type glycine  xxxg81xxx  with a signi®cance value of p50.05, p50.01, or p50.005, respectively. data for tcet has
been previously published (krasowski et al., 1998a).

actions of a-chloralose and b-chloralose
the modulatory actions of a-chloralose at inhibitory ligandgated ion channels dier markedly from those of the ether,
alcohol, and alkane general anaesthetics. this is somewhat
surprising because a-chloralose structurally resembles the
halogenated alcohols, being formed essentially from the
condensation of chloral hydrate with glucose (see figure 1).
the main dierences are the complete absence of potentiation of
submaximal glycine currents by a-chloralose at glycine a1
receptors, and the lack of eect of the gabaa receptor
mutations studied here on potentiation of gaba responses by
a-chloralose. in addition, a-chloralose directly activates
gabaa receptors with high potency and ecacy, something
not seen with the ether, alkane, and alcohol general anaesthetics
british journal of pharmacology, vol 129 (4)

analysed in this study. the total pattern of a-chloralose activity
more closely resembles that of the barbiturates and steroidal
anaesthetics (prince & simmonds, 1992; koltchine et al., 1996;
mascia et al., 1996; pistis et al., 1997).
the a- and b-chloralose structural isomers exhibit substantial
potency dierences for general anaesthesia (monroe et al.,
1963a,b), which are paralleled by similar potency dierences for
potentiation of gaba responses and direct activation of
gabaa a2b1 receptors (table 1). interestingly, the nonanaesthetic b-chloralose is also unable to antagonize the
potentiation of gaba responses or direct activation produced
by a-chloralose. this suggests the presence of a speci®c binding
site on the gabaa receptor for a-chloralose that excludes bchloralose. these results also are consistent with the gabaa
receptor playing a role in the anaesthetic actions of a-chloralose.

interpretation of the eects of the mutations within tm2
and  xxxg2318xxx  of gabaa and  xxxg904xxx  subunits on
potentiation of agonist responses by general anaesthetics
mihic et al. (1997) demonstrated that speci®c mutations within
tm2 and  xxxg2318xxx  of gabaa and  xxxg904xxx  subunits
aected the potentiation of agonist responses by en¯urane and
ethanol. these ®ndings were later extended to long-chain nalcohols and iso¯urane (krasowski et al., 1998b; wick et al.,
1998). the eects of the receptor mutations studied were
qualitatively similar for all ®ve ethers, with the sole exception
that potentiation of submaximal gaba-evoked currents by
iso¯urane, but not by the other four ethers, was abolished at the
gabaa a2b1(s265i) receptor (table 1). this indicates subtle
dierences between structurally related ethers with respect to
the eects of the mutations in tm2 and  xxxg2318xxx  of the gabaa
receptor subunits; for example, en¯urane and iso¯urane are
positional isomers of one another (figure 1). trichloroethylene, a halogenated alkane, displayed a response pattern to
mutations similar to that of the ethers, with the exception that
trichloroethylene did not potentiate submaximal glycine
responses at the glycine a1(s267i) receptor (figure 8).
this leads to the question of how these mutations abolish
the potentiating actions of the general anaesthetics. two
possibilities are: (1) the mutations alter the characteristics of
the binding sites for the general anaesthetics or (2) the
mutations perturb an allosteric mechanism necessary for the
positive modulatory eects of the anaesthetics. in possibility
(1), the residues which are mutated need not necessarily be
physically involved in binding the anaesthetics, but may
control the dimensions of a nearby anaesthetic binding pocket.
in possibility (2), the mutated amino acids may be quite distant
from the actual binding sites for the general anaesthetics. the
gabaa and  xxxg904xxx  subunit mutations described in
this study have already been shown to alter the apparent
anity for agonist (michic et al., 1997; krasowski et al.,
1998a,b), presumably by an alteration of a gating mechanism.
a previous study has suggested that certain mutations in
tm2 of the glycine  xxxg81xxx  (e.g., s267q) change the
dimensions of a `binding pocket' for n-alcohols, manifested by
an alteration of the n-alcohol `cut-o' for the regulation of
glycine responses (wick et al., 1998). straight-chain alcohols
up to  xxxd1922xxx  potentiate glycine responses at the wild-type
glycine  xxxg81xxx  (mascia et al., 1996), whereas only alcohols
up to  xxxd3026xxx  inhibit submaximal glycine currents at the
glycine a1(s267q) receptor (wick et al., 1998). a similar
alteration of cut-o by the gabaa receptor mutations may be
evident for the primary and tertiary alcohols examined in this

general anaesthetics, gabaa and glycine receptors

study. tcet potentiates submaximal gaba responses at the
gabaa a2(s270i)b1 receptor while the larger chloral hydrate,
tbret, chloretone, and brometone molecules all fail to
enhance gaba responses at this receptor. similarly, tcet
and chloral hydrate both enhance submaximal gaba
responses at the gabaa a2(a291w)b1 receptor while the
other alcohols do not potentiate gaba responses at this
receptor (table 1). it is perhaps noteworthy that none of the
tertiary alcohols potentiate gaba responses at the gabaa
a2(s270i)b1 and a2(a291w)b1 receptors. the dierences in
molecular geometries between primary and tertiary alcohols
may aid molecular modeling studies of alcohol interactions
with gabaa and glycine receptors.
these size-dependent, agent-speci®c eects on the mutated
receptors are dicult to reconcile with the idea of an `allosteric
switch' that is altered by the mutations. instead, the mutations
might alter the dimensions of binding pockets for the
anaesthetics, akin to the idea proposed by wick et al. (1998)
for the n-alcohols at the glycine  xxxg81xxx . in accounting for
the dierential actions of the gabaa b1(s265i) mutation on
potentiation of gaba responses by the ether anaesthetics
(figure 7), it seems extravagant to envision that en¯urane,
methoxy¯urane, sevo¯urane, and  xxxd2052xxx  utilize allosteric
mechanisms distinct from that for iso¯urane.
de®nitive identi®cation of general anaesthetic binding
pockets probably awaits the determination of high-resolution
three-dimensional structures for the ligand-gated ion channels.
structural biology approaches have already been applied to the
study of general anaesthetic interactions with `model' soluble
proteins (eckenho & johansson, 1997), including the 2.2 aê
resolution three-dimensional structure of ®re¯y luciferase
complexed with the general anaesthetic bromoform (franks
et al., 1998). this structure provides a striking example of an
amphipathic anaesthetic binding cavity of de®ned dimensions.
it will be interesting to see whether amino acid residues within
tm2 and  xxxg2318xxx  of gabaa and glycine receptors may yet prove
to control a similar binding pocket for ether, alkane, and
alcohol anaesthetics.
