autoradiographic localization of [125 i-tyr0 ]bradykinin
binding sites in brains of wistar-kyoto and spontaneously
hypertensive rats

summary
1. the present study was undertaken to localize and characterize bradykinin (bk)
binding sites in brains from wistar-kyoto (wky) and spontaneously hypertensive rats
(shr).
2. serial sections of brains were cut from adult wky and shr and specific [125 ityr0 ]bradykinin ([125 i-tyr0 ]bk) binding was determined using in vitro quantitative receptor
autoradiographic techniques.
3. specific binding of [125 i tyr0 ]bk was localized in the medulla oblongata to the
regions of the nucleus of the solitary tract (nts), area postrema (ap), dorsal motor nucleus
of the vagus (x), and caudal subnucleus of the spinal trigeminal nucleus in both strains of
rat. the specific binding (85–90% of total binding) was of high affinity and saturable with
kd values in the range of 100 pm and a bmax of 0.75 fmol per mg tissue equivalent in the
nts–x–ap complex of both the wky and shr. in competition studies, the rank order of
potencies was similar in both strains with bk = lys-bk >  xxxd2317xxx  >>> desarg9 -bk. the
b2 receptor antagonist  xxxd2317xxx  inhibited [125 i-tyr0 ]bk binding with a ki value of 0.63 ±
0.19 nm in wky and 0.91 ± 0.73 nm in shr, while ki values for the b1 receptor agonist
desarg9 -bk were 1475 ± 1055 and 806 ±362 nm in wky and shr, respectively.
4. our finding of specific high-affinity [125 i-tyr0 ]bk b2 binding sites in the nts, ap,
and the x of wky and shr is important because these brain areas are associated with
central cardiovascular regulation. however, alterations in bk b2 receptors in the medulla
that could contribute to the hypertensive state in the shr were not detected.

introduction
the existence of an endogenous brain  xxxg1280xxx –kinin system is well established. both  xxxg1280xxx  and kininogenase activities have been demonstrated
and measured in brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid (csf) (chao et al., 1983; diz,
1985; khan et al., 1993, 1995; scicli, et al., 1984).  xxxg1280xxx  has been localized
immunocytochemically in cell bodies of certain neuronal nuclei of the rat hypothalamus (simson et al., 1985). kininogen has been detected in human csf (scicli et al.,
1984) and localized immunohistochemically in neurons of the hypothalamus of the
adult rat (richoux et al., 1991). immunoreactive kinin has also been demonstrated
in mammalian brain tissue (corrêa et al., 1979) and csf (khan et al, 1995; thomas
et al., 1984). finally, both bradykinin (bk) b1 and b2 receptor binding sites have
been identified within the brain (fujiwara et al., 1989; privitera et al., 1992; raidoo
and bhoola, 1997).
there is increasing evidence that the brain kallikrein–kinin system is involved
in central regulation of cardiovascular function. administration of bk into various
brain sites increases blood pressure and heart rate (corrêa and graef, 1974, 1975;
diz and jacobowitz 1984; fior et al., 1993; thomas and hiley, 1988). injection of bk
into rostral ventrolateral medulla produces a pressor response, while blockade of
bk b2 receptors in this brain area prevents the pressor response to injected bk and
lowers blood pressure (privitera et al., 1994). recently, activation of bk b1 receptors
in the brain by selective agonists was also shown to be associated with elevations in
blood pressure (emanueli et al., 1999). in addition, activation of the brain kallikrein–
kinin system by a variety of maneuvers results in an elevation of blood pressure and
tachycardia (thomas et al., 1984, 1987).
there is relatively little information regarding the activity of the endogenous
brain  xxxg1280xxx –kinin system in normal and hypertensive rats. in previous studies, we evaluated the brain kallikrein–kinin system in normotensive wistar-kyoto
(wky) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (shr) by measuring the csf levels of various components of the system (khan et al., 1995) and found that both
 xxxg1280xxx  and kinin levels were higher in the csf of adult shr than in
age-matched normotensive wky rats. csf kininogenase was also higher in the
adult shr. collectively, these data indicated that there is a hyperactive kallikrein–
kinin system in the brain of the shr that may contribute to the hypertensive
state.
there is also limited information about where this peptide and its receptors
are located within the brain. we previously reported the location of specific bk b2
receptor binding sites in guinea pig brain by in vitro quantitative receptor autoradiography (privitera et al., 1992). these sites were located primarily in areas of the brain
stem associated with central cardiovascular regulation and pain mediation (barnes
et al., 1979; bystrzycka and nail, 1985; reis et al., 1984).
the purpose of the present study was to extend the autoradiographic localization
of bk receptor sites to brains from adult normotensive wky and shr using [125 ityr0 ]bk as the radioligand and to determine whether there are differences in bk
binding between the two strains of rats.

methods and materials
animals and blood pressure measurements
experiments were performed on 16- to 18-week-old male normotensive wky
and shr (harlan sprague dawley, indianapolis, in), which were housed in facilities at constant room temperature and a 12-h light–dark cycle with free access to
rat chow and water. the facilities are accredited by the american association for
accreditation of laboratory animal care and all animal studies were approved by
the institutional animal care and use committee.
rats were verified to be normotensive or hypertensive by tail cuff plethysmography, using the natsumi blood pressure pulse monitor (rat tail mamometer–
tachometer system). systolic blood pressure of normotensive wky rats was significantly different from that of shr (122.16 ± 2.06 mmhg vs. 188.41 ± 2.47 mmhg,
respectively, p < .0001) as was heart rate (319.17 ± 4.80 beats per minute vs. 384.13 ±
6.08 beats per minute, respectively, p < .0001).
preparation of tissue sections
rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.p.), and then
decapitated. the whole brain was removed and frozen at −30◦ c using isopentane
cooled by dry ice. serial 12 µm coronal sections of brain tissue were cut at −15◦ c
in a cryostat and mounted onto gelatin-coated microscope slides. mounted tissue
sections were kept at room temperature until dry and then stored at −20◦ c for up to
3 weeks. this storage period did not affect the binding of [125 i-tyr0 ]bk on the brain
sections (unpublished results).
preparation of labeled [tyr0 -i]bk
[tyr0 ]bk was iodinated by the iodogen method of fraker and speck (1978)
using the i0do-gen iodination reagent (pierce chemical co., inc.). labeled peptide was purified by reverse-phase hplc using a c18 biophase column (bioanalytical
systems, inc., west lafayette, in) and an acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoracetic acid gradient (20–80% over 30 min at 1 ml/min). the specific activity of [125 i-tyr0 ]-bk was
2200 ci/mmol.
incubation assay conditions
on the day of the experiment, slide-mounted tissue sections were warmed to
room temperature and preincubated for 30 min at 37◦ c in 25 mm tes buffer (ph
7.4). slides were then placed flat in a draft-proof chamber, allowed to cool to 4◦ c,
and then 2.0 ml (sufficient to completely cover the sections on the slide) of 25 mm
tes incubation buffer (ph 7.4) containing [125 i-tyr0 ]bk (10–1000 pm) was applied
to each slide. the incubation buffer contained 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, 140 µg/ml
bacitracin, 0.1 mm captopril, 1 mm dithiothreitol (dtt), 300 mm sucrose, and 0.2%

bsa. incubation was carried out for 120 min at 4◦ c. adjacent sections placed on
separate slides were exposed to the same concentrations of radioligand in the presence of 1 µm bk to define nonspecific binding. the incubation was terminated by
draining the incubation buffer from the slides and rinsing the slides consecutively 3 ×
2 min in 500 ml glass troughs with 25 mm tes (ph 7.4) buffer containing 300 mm
sucrose at 4◦ c. the slides were then dipped into ice-cold deionized water (4◦ c) to
remove buffer salts. slides were dried in a stream of cold air for 20 min and placed
in a vacuum desiccator overnight.
measurement of bound ligand
slide-mounted tissue sections and a set of [125 i]-microscale standards
(amersham) were apposed to a sheet of hyperfilm (amersham) and exposed for 5–7
days. autoradiograms were developed in kodak d-19 developer for 3 min, rinsed in
deionized water, fixed in kodak unifix for 3 min, and washed in water for 20 min. to
identify the nuclei of the medulla, adjacent sections were stained with cresyl violet.
quantitative analyses of autoradiograms were accomplished using a microcomputerbased image analysis system (beckstead, 1988a; beckstead et al., 1988b). briefly, the
system consists of a wild m420 macroscope with a stabilized light source (stahl research labs) and a dage-mti series 68 video camera. the video signal is digitized by
the pc vision-plus frame grabber (imaging technology) and analyzed with software
developed by robert beckstead and m. wong.
the optical density (od) was measured for each of the [125 i]-microscale standard autoradiographic images, and a standard curve of the natural log of the optical
density versus the natural log of the tissue concentration of 125 i was then generated
using the computer-assisted image analysis system. optical density measurements
were then made on total and nonspecific binding autoradiographic images from the
selected region of the brain. specific [125 i-tyr0 ]bk binding values were obtained
by superimposing the nonspecific image on a template of the total binding image,
followed by automatic subtraction of the od of the nonspecific image from the
od of the total binding image. the amount of bound radioligand (nci/mg of tissue
wet-weight) was calculated by interpolation on a standard curve by linear regression analysis. this value was then divided by the specific activity (in ci/mmol) of the
radioligand and multiplied by 1000 to yield the expression of bound radioligand in
fmol/mg of tissue wet-weight. the stereotaxic atlas of paxinos and watson (1986) is
used as a guide in identifying brain regions. each data point represents the average
reading from four to six tissue sections.
quantitative studies
for the following studies, combined quantitative measurements were made in
the regions of the nucleus of the solitary tract (nts), the dorsal motor nucleus of the
vagus nerve (x), and the area postrema (ap). the kinetics of specific binding association was determined by incubating serial brain sections for various time intervals
(0–150 min) at 4◦ c in tes incubation buffer containing 50 pm [125 i-tyr0 ]bk in the
presence or absence of 1 µm bk. saturation binding experiments were performed

using increasing concentrations of [125 i-tyr0 ]bk (0.01–1.0 nm) in tes incubation
buffer in the presence or absence of 1 µm bk. competition studies were carried
out with tes incubation buffer containing 50 pm [125 i-tyr0 ]bk in the presence
or absence of up to seven different concentrations of competing unlabeled ligand.
all incubations were carried out for 120 min at 4◦ c. saturation data was analyzed
by nonlinear, least-square regression analysis. the competitive inhibition data was
analyzed by allfit and inhibition constants (ki ) were calculated by the cheng–
prusoff equation (cheng and prusoff, 1973). the receptor binding data were analyzed
by “ultrafit” (biosoft) for the association rate constants.

materials
 xxxd2317xxx  (hoe 140;  xxxd862xxx -hyp3 -thi5 -d-tic7 -oic8 ]bk) was a gift from hoechst
ag (frankfurt, germany). all other peptide analogues were purchased from sigma
(st. louis, mo).
results
autoradiographic studies on brains from adult wky and shr indicate that
there are high-density specific [125 i-tyr0 ]bk binding sites in the caudal medulla.
as can be seen in fig. 1(a) and (b), high-density binding sites for [125 i-tyr0 ]bk
were found in areas associated with the nucleus of the solitary tract (nts), area
postrema (ap), dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (x), and caudal subnucleus of
the sp5. specific binding (defined by displacement of [125 i-tyr0 ]bk) in these areas
represented 80–90% of total binding. within the nts, the highest concentration of
binding sites for [125 i-tyr0 ]bk was observed in the medial portion of the nts and
extended caudally from the most caudal portion of the medial vestibular nucleus to
the commissural portion of the nts.
in kinetic studies, specific [125 i-tyr0 ]bk binding reached equilibrium after
120 min incubation at 4◦ c. the observed association rate constants (kobs ) for specific
[125 i-tyr0 ]bk binding were calculated for each region and were found to be similar
and ranged from 0.205 ± 0.0152 to 0.42 ± .0097 min−1 (fig. 2). an incubation time
of 120 min was chosen for subsequent binding experiments. in saturation binding
studies, specific [125 i-tyr0 ]bk binding in the medulla was saturable and reversible
over a range of .01–.5 nm and nonlinear least-square regression analysis indicated
the presence of a single high-affinity binding site in both groups of rats. equilibrium
dissociation constant (kd ) values and maximal number of binding sites (bmax ) for
the nts–x–ap and sp5 for both shr and wky are summarized in table i. no
significant differences in affinity or maximal number of binding sites between shr
and wky rats were observed.
in competitive displacement studies, quantitative analysis of autoradiograms by
computer-assisted image analysis system showed that unlabeled bk and related analogues produce dose-dependent inhibition of specific [125 i-tyr0 ]bk binding (fig. 3)
where the rank order of potency in both the wky and shr was bk = lys-bk >  xxxd2317xxx  >>> desarg9 -bk. as indicated in table ii, the bk b2 antagonist

descending levels of the medulla oblongata of the wky and shr. a1–f1 show total binding
and a2–f2 show nonspecific binding (binding remaining in the presence of 1 µm bk). note high
level of specific binding in nucleus of the solitary tract (nts), dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus
(x), area postrema (ap), and nucleus commissuralis (nc).the caudal subnucleus of the spinal
trigeminal nucleus (sp5) also shows a high density of specific labeling.

 xxxd2317xxx  was about 5 times less potent than bk in its ability to inhibit the binding
of [125 i-tyr0 ]bk in wky and shr, while the bk b1 receptor agonist desarg9 -bk
was approximately 10,000 times less potent in both strains of rats. the ki ’s for bk
and its analogue lys-bk in the nts–x–ap complex or sp5 regions of the wky rats
were not significantly different from values generated in these regions of shr.

discussion
the present study in rats extends our previous observations in guinea pig brain
where we showed the presence of high-affinity specific bk binding sites of the bk b2
receptor type in areas of the medulla associated with central cardiovascular regulation and pain mediation (privitera et al., 1992). similarly, analysis of autoradiograms
from tissue sections of both adult wky and shr in the present study also showed
the presence of specific [125 i-tyr0 ]bk binding sites in the medullary region of the
brain. high densities of specific [125 i-tyr0 ]bk binding were localized in the nts,
ap, x, and in the caudal subnucleus of the sp5. specific [125 i-tyr1 ]bk binding sites
have previously been reported in synaptosomal membranes from several regions
of rat brain with densities highest in the pineal gland, moderate in the hypophysis,
hypothalamus and septum, and low in the dorsal and rostroventrolateral medulla

fig. 2. the kinetics of specific binding association was determined by incubating serial tissue
sections of wky and shr medulla at 4◦ c for various time intervals (0–150 min) with 50 pm
[125 i]bk in the presence or absence of 1 µm of bk. the observed association rate constant
(kobs ) for specific [125 i]bk binding in the nts–x–ap complex and subnucleus of the spinal
trigeminal nucleus (sp5) of both the wky and shr were calculated (n = 3).

(alvarez et al., 1992) with kd values ranging from 100 to 700 pm. on the other hand,
studies on the regional distribution of [3 h]bk binding in membranes from guinea
pig brain showed that specific binding was highest in the medulla and pons, moderate
in cerebral cortex, and low in hypothalamus (fujiwara et al., 1989). the reason for
the wider distribution of bk binding sites in membrane preparations of brain regions
versus our findings using autoradiographic data is not clear and may be related to
the differences in techniques used among the studies.

in the guinea pig. alvarez et al. (1992) did not define the subtype of bk receptor

a nuc

high-affinity [125 i-tyr0 ]bk binding sites of the b2 receptor subtype were localized in the nts, ap, and x of the rat medulla. these areas are known to be associated
with central cardiovascular regulatory mechanisms (reis et al., 1984). the nts is the
major site of termination of baroreceptor and cardiopulmonary afferent neurons,
and neurons originating in the nts project to the ventrolateral medulla containing
neurons which project to cell bodies of preganglionic sympathetic neurons in the
thoracic spinal cord (reis et al., 1987). in addition, the ap is contiguous to the nts
and is involved in regulation of central sympathetic outflow (barnes et al., 1979;
ferrario et al., 1979). the presence of bk b2 receptors has also been demonstrated
by quantitative autoradiography in these regions of guinea pig brain (privitera et al.,
1992) and in guinea pig spinal cord (lopes et al., 1993) as well as in rat spinal cord
(lopes et al., 1995). bk b2 receptors at various sites in the rat brain (privitera et al.,
1994) including the nts mediate hypertensive responses to bk and related analogues (lindsey et al., 1988), and blockade of b2 receptors in rat rostral ventrolateral
medulla is associated with a reduction in blood pressure (privitera et al., 1994). the
presence of specific bk b2 binding sites in these brainstem nuclei together with observations that pharmacologic activation of b2 receptors in this region elevate blood
pressure support a role for the brain kallikrein–kinin system in the central control
of blood pressure.
in the present study, we found that neither the affinity nor the number of specific [125 i-tyr0 ]bk binding sites were significantly different in the combined nts,
ap, x region of the medulla of shr as compared to wky rats. similarly, no difference in binding affinity or density in the sp5 was noted between the two strains.
previous studies have demonstrated that csf kallikrein, kinin, and kininogenase
levels are elevated in the shr (khan et al., 1995). others have found that shr
show an enhanced sensitivity to the hypertensive actions of centrally administered
bk. augmented hypertensive responses to bk in shr occur following injection into
the lateral and fourth ventricles, and the rostral ventrolateral medulla of the brain
(bunag and takahaski, 1981; lindsey et al., 1988; martins et al., 1991; privitera et al.,
1994; unger et al., 1981). moreover, blockade of bk b1 and b2 receptors in the brain

lowers blood pressure to a greater extent in the shr than wky rats (emanueli
et al., 1999, privitera et al., 1994). indeed, this hyperactive state might also be related,
in part, to reduced brain kininase activity (lindsey et al., 1988; martins et al., 1991).
thus, although there is evidence to suggest that a hyperactive brain kallikrein–kinin
system may contribute to the maintenance of blood pressure in the shr, the present
study did not detect altered b2 receptor binding affinity nor number of b2 receptor binding sites in the shr that might contribute to the hypertensive state in this
hypertensive rat model. however, given the high degree of variance in the data,
large differences in receptors would have been needed to be present for a significant
difference to be detected.
in conclusion, the results of the present experiments suggest that there are
high-density-specific bk b2 receptor binding sites in nts, ap, x, and in the caudal
subnucleus of the sp5 regions of the medulla of the wky and shr. these findings
may be important because these areas of the medulla are associated with central
regulation of blood pressure and pain mediation. however, alteration in bk b2
receptors in these areas of the medulla that could contribute to the hypertensive
state in the shr were not detected.
