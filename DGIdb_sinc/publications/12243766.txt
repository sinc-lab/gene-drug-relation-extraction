abstract
d- xxxd3456xxx  is a potent competitive antagonist of both the muscle-type  xxxg456xxx  (achr) and the serotonin type-3 receptor ( xxxg1116xxx ). we have previously used a series of structural analogs of d- xxxd3456xxx  to demonstrate that the
ligand-binding domains of both receptors share common structural features. we have now extended these studies to examine the
interaction of a series of d- xxxd3456xxx  analogs with 5ht3rs containing mutations at either of two residues within the ligandbinding domain of the receptor (w90f and r92a). the w90f mutation results in an approximately 2–4-fold decrease in the affinity
of the analogs relative to wild-type receptors, while the r92a results in an approximately 8–10-fold increase in affinity. however,
since the effect of a given mutation is more or less equivalent for all analogs, neither residue w90 nor r92 is likely to make a
specific interaction with d- xxxd3456xxx  itself. rather, these two residues are likely to play a role in determining both the geometry
of the binding site, as well as the overall environment that a ligand encounters in the binding site.  2002 elsevier science ltd.

1. introduction
the serotonin type 3 receptor ( xxxg1116xxx ) is a member
of the ligand-gated ion channel gene family, which
includes the muscle and neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors (achr), the  xxxg904xxx  (glyr), and the
gamma- xxxd2177xxx  type a (gabaar) receptor (karlin
and akabas, 1995; ortells and lunt, 1995; unwin,
1993). the receptor consists of two different subunits,
termed  xxxg1116xxx  and 5-ht3b (davies et al., 1999; dubin
et al., 1999; hanna et al., 2000; maricq et al., 1991).
expression of the  xxxg1116xxx  subunit alone results in the
appearance of 5-ht-gated ion channels with ligand
specificity similar to that of native 5-ht3rs, but with
smaller-than-normal single-channel conductance than
the native receptor. expression of the 5-ht3b subunits
alone does not produce 5-ht-gated channels. however,
co-expression of the  xxxg1116xxx  and 5-ht3b subunits results
in expression of receptors with the pharmacological and
ion permeation properties of native receptors (davies et
al., 1999; dubin et al., 1999).

like all members of the family, the  xxxg1116xxx  subunits
exhibit a large degree of sequence similarity to the
achr (davies et al., 1999; dubin et al., 1999; hanna
et al., 2000; maricq et al., 1991). chimeras consisting
of the n-terminal domain of the alpha7 neuronal achr and
the c-terminal region of the  xxxg1116xxx  subunit form functional ligand-gated ion channels with pharmacological
specificity of the achr and permeability properties of
receptors composed of  xxxg1116xxx  subunits (eisele et al.,
1993), suggesting that the two receptors also have quite
similar structures and signal transduction properties.
a large number of chemical labeling and mutagenesis
studies have been carried out to determine the structural
features of the ligand-binding site of the achr , and
details concerning the structure of the site(s) for agonists
and competitive antagonists are beginning to appear (for
reviews see arias, 1997; corringer et al., 2000; karlin,
2002). on the other hand, far less is known about the
structure of the ligand-binding domain of the  xxxg1116xxx 
(for a review see reeves and lummis, 2002). over the
past few years, we have used information obtained from
the (relatively) well-studied achr to guide structure–
function studies on the  xxxg1116xxx . one ligand that the two
receptors have in common is the competitive antagonist
d- xxxd3456xxx , which has nanomolar affinity for mouse

(papineni and pedersen, 1997) and torpedo (pedersen
and cohen, 1990) nicotinic ach receptors. while dtubocurarine has micromolar affinity for human (bufton
et al., 1993) and guinea pig (newberry et al., 1991) 5ht3rs, it has nanomolar affinity for mouse and rat 5ht3rs (lummis et al., 1990; newberry et al., 1991; peters et al., 1990). analysis of the interactions of a number
of d- xxxd3456xxx  analogs with the achr and homomeric  xxxg1116xxx  receptors demonstrated that structure–
activity relationships for the interaction of d- xxxd3456xxx  with the two types of receptors are more or less identical (papineni and pedersen, 1997; pedersen and papineni, 1995; yan et al., 1998), suggesting that the
structure of the ligand-binding sites of the two receptors
are similar. in line with this finding, we subsequently
showed that a tryptophan residue in the  xxxg1116xxx  subunit
(w90) that is homologous to tryptophans in the gamma (gammaw55)
and delta (deltaw57) subunits of the achr known to be
important for d- xxxd3456xxx  interaction with the achr
(chiara and cohen, 1997) is also important for d- xxxd3456xxx  interaction with the  xxxg1116xxx . replacement of this
residue with phenylalanine (w90f) resulted in receptors
with a tenfold lower sensitivity to d- xxxd3456xxx  and
other antagonists such as granisetron, but had no effect
on the interaction of agonists with the receptor. in
addition, replacement of a nearby residue (r92) by alanine (r92a) resulted in receptors with a reduced affinity
for serotonin and granisetron, and an increased affinity
for d- xxxd3456xxx  (yan et al., 1999).
while these data demonstrate that the region around
w90 is important for receptor–d- xxxd3456xxx  interactions, other regions of the receptor are also important for
the interaction of d- xxxd3456xxx  with the  xxxg1116xxx . hope et al. (1999) have shown that mutations of
amino acids in the  xxxg1116xxx  subunit around position 225
also affect the affinity of d- xxxd3456xxx  for 5-ht3rs,
indicating that multiple regions of the receptor are
involved in the interaction of d- xxxd3456xxx  (and by
extension, other ligands) with the receptor.
in this study, we examined the effects of these two
mutations (w90f and r92a) on the interaction of a
number of d- xxxd3456xxx  analogs with the receptor. we
find that the analogs are similarly affected by the two
mutations. the lack of a selective effect of either
mutation on the interaction of the analogs with the receptor suggests that while these two residues do play an
important role defining the environment of the ligandbinding site, neither is likely to make a specific interaction with d- xxxd3456xxx  itself.
2. materials and methods
2.1. molecular biology and transfection
a full-length cdna clone corresponding to the 5ht3a(b) form (hope et al., 1993) of the receptor was

isolated from a neuroblastoma n1e-115 cell line cdna
library as previously described (yan et al., 1999) and
subcloned into vector pci (promega, madison, wi).
site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the
quickchange system (stratagene, la jolla, ca) as
described previously (yan et al., 1999). the nomenclature used to describe mutants is amino acid in wildtype/position/substitution; e.g., w90f. because the
amino terminus of the mature  xxxg1116xxx  subunit is
unknown, the amino acid numbering system here
includes the signal sequence and has the initial methionine as position 1. please note that the numbering system
for the  xxxg1116xxx  receptor used in a previous study from
this laboratory has changed somewhat so that the w90f
and r92a mutations in this study correspond to the
w89f and r91a mutations in the original study (yan
et al., 1999), respectively. cultures of tsa201 cells, a
derivative of the widely used hek 293 cell line, were
maintained in dmem medium containing 10% fetal
bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 units/ml
streptomycin. cultures at 30–40% confluence were
transfected with 20 µg receptor cdna per 100 mm dish
using the calcium phosphate technique (wigler et al.,
1979). after 12 h exposure to the dna/calcium phosphate solution, the medium was replaced with fresh
medium and the cells were allowed to grow for another
24–36 h prior to use. maximal expression was obtained
36–72 h after transfection.
2.2. ligand binding assays
transfected cells were scraped from dishes, washed
once with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended
and homogenized in 2.5 ml 154 mm nacl, 50 mm trishcl, ph 7.4 per 100 mm dish. the homogenate was
then used in binding assays or frozen until needed. we
observed no change in either ligand affinity or bmax
values after freezing.
membranes were incubated for 2 h at 37°c in a total
volume of 0.5 ml 154 mm nacl, 50 mm trishcl, ph
7.4 containing the appropriate concentrations of antagonist and radioligand ([3h] granisetron; new england
nuclear, 85 ci/mmol). binding was terminated by rapid
vacuum filtration onto gf/b filters that had been pretreated with 50 mm trishcl, ph 7.4, 0.2% polyethyleneimine, and the filters were washed with 10 ml cold
50 mm trishcl, ph 7.4 per sample. nonspecific binding
was defined as that binding not displaced by 100 µm mchlorophenyl biguanide. each data point in the figures
represents the mean ± sem of 3 determinations. ic50
values for various antagonists were determined by fitting
the data to eq. (1) using a levenberg–marquardt algorithm in a commercially available software package for
macintosh computers (igor pro, wavemetrics,
oswego, or):
q ⫽ (1 ⫹ ([i] / ic50)n)⫺1

(1)

d. yan, m.m. white / neuropharmacology 43 (2002) 367–373

where q is the fractional amount of [3h] granisetron
bound in the presence of the antagonist at concentration
[i] compared to that in the absence of antagonist, ic50
is the concentration of antagonist at which q = 0.5, and
n is the apparent hill coefficient. ki values were calculated from the ic50 values and the kd for [3h] granisetron
using the cheng–prusoff relation (cheng and prusoff,
1973) (eq. (2).):
ki ⫽

ic50
1 ⫹ ([l] / kd)

(2)

where [l] is the concentration of [3h] granisetron used
to determine the ic50 value in the experiment and kd is
the dissociation constant for [3h] granisetron. for the
cheng–prusoff relation to be applicable, the hill coefficient for the ic50 curve must be equal to 1. in our
experiments, all hill coefficients were not statistically
different from unity at a 95% confidence level (data not
shown). in this study, all experiments were carried out
with a [3h] granisetron concentration equal to its experimentally determined dissociation constant for the particular receptor (wt: 1.5 nm; w90f: 11 nm; r92a: 7.5
nm (yan et al., 1999)), meaning that the ic50 values
were twice the ki.
2.3. d- xxxd3456xxx  analogs
the structures of the d- xxxd3456xxx  analogs used in
this study are shown in fig. 1. two of the compounds

were obtained commercially: d- xxxd3456xxx  (sigma, st.
louis, mo) and  xxxd2625xxx  (diosynth, inc., chicago,
il) and the others were obtained from dr. steen pedersen of baylor university (papineni and pedersen,
1997; pedersen and papineni, 1995). purity of all compounds was checked by hplc both before use and after
prolonged incubation with the assay buffers.

3. results
previously, we had examined the interaction of a series of d- xxxd3456xxx  analogs (fig. 1) with wild-type
5ht3rs and showed that the structure–activity relationships for the interactions of these analogs for the  xxxg1116xxx 
were similar to those for the achr (yan et al., 1998).
in this report, we have extended these studies to include
receptors with mutations at two positions which are
located in one of the portions of the  xxxg1116xxx  ligand binding site, w90f and r92a (yan et al., 1999). the affinities of d- xxxd3456xxx  and the series of analogs for wildtype, w90f, and r92a receptors were determined by
competitive inhibition of [3h] granisetron binding (table
1). fig. 2 shows inhibition data for d- xxxd3456xxx  for
the three receptor types. it can be seen that the w90f
mutation increases the ic50 for d- xxxd3456xxx  relative to
wild-type, while the r92a mutation decreases the ic50
relative to wild-type.
the effects of these two mutations on the interaction
of d- xxxd3456xxx  with the receptor are seen for the other
analogs as well. fig. 3 shows the effects of the mutations
on the interaction of sulfo-d- xxxd3456xxx , which contains a sulfonate group at position 13’, with the receptors. although the affinity of this analog with the wildtype receptor is approximately 100-fold lower than that
of d- xxxd3456xxx , the two mutations have the same relative effect on affinity — w90f decreases affinity, while
r92a increases the affinity.
fig. 4 shows the pki values for all ten compounds (dtubocurarine and nine analogs) for the mutant receptors
plotted against their affinities for the wild-type receptor.
as is the case for the interaction of the analogs with
wild-type receptors (yan et al., 1998), the affinities for
the mutants span an approximately 100-fold concentration range (60–180-fold, depending on the receptor).
in addition, the effect of the mutations on each analog
are more or less the same; e.g., the analogs exhibit an
increased affinity for the r92a receptor relative to wildtype receptors, while the analogs have reduced affinity
for the w90f receptors. finally, the rank order of affinities of the compounds for the two mutant receptors are
similar to each other, as well as to that observed for
wild-type receptors, suggesting that the structure–
activity relationships are identical for all three receptors.
this information can provide some insight into the roles
that w90 and/or r92 may play in the interaction of d-

estimates of pki values were calculated from experimentally determined pic50 values for the inhibition of [3h] granisetron binding to wild-type
or mutant receptors as described in the methods section. errors represent the error determined by the levenberg-marquardt regression routine used
in the fitting. values for the mutant receptors marked with ∗ are statistically different from wild-type at a 95% confidence level using student’s
t test, while those marked with # are statistically different from wild-type at a 90% confidence level.

fig. 2. the w90f and r92a mutations have different affects on dtubocurarine affinity. the concentration dependences of inhibition of
[3h] granisetron binding by d- xxxd3456xxx  to wild-type (쎲), w90f
(䊏), and r92a (왖) homomeric 5ht3rs are shown. the solid curves
are drawn according to eq. (1) with ic50 values of 530 nm (wildtype), 1800 nm (w90f), and 71 nm (r92a). note that the w90f
mutation decreases d- xxxd3456xxx  affinity, while the r92a mutation
increases affinity.

fig. 3. mutations have effects on a charged analog similar to that of
d- xxxd3456xxx . the concentration dependences of inhibition of [3h]
granisetron binding by the negatively charge sulfo–d- xxxd3456xxx  to

shown. the solid curves are drawn according to eq. (1) with ic50
values of 35,290 nm (wild-type), 132,900 nm (w90f), and 1750 nm
(r92a). note that once again, the w90f mutation reduces the affinity
of the competitor, while the r92a mutation increases it.

 xxxd3456xxx  (and perhaps other ligands) with the
 xxxg1116xxx .

(yan et al., 1998), strongly suggesting that the ligandbinding sites of both receptors share common structural
features. subsequent to that, we showed that mutation
of a tryptophan in the  xxxg1116xxx  (w90) that is homologous
to tryptophans in the muscle-type achr that are known
to interact with d- xxxd3456xxx  (gammaw55, deltaw57) reduced
the affinity of d- xxxd3456xxx  and a number of antagonists for the  xxxg1116xxx  (yan et al., 1999). in support of the
idea that w90 plays a role in ligand–receptor interactions, spier and lummis (spier and lummis, 2000) have
shown that replacement of w90 by serine (w90s) does
not interfere with surface expression of the receptor, but
completely abolishes both [3h]granisetron and [3h] mchlorophenylbiguanide binding.

4. discussion
we have measured the affinity of d- xxxd3456xxx  and
a number of analogs for two mutant homomeric 5ht3rs
in order to examine the types of interactions that these
competitive antagonists make with the ligand-binding
site of the receptor. in a previous study, we showed that
the structure–activity relationship for the interaction of
these antagonists with the wild-type  xxxg1116xxx  were similar
to that for muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors

fig. 4. comparison of the affinities of the d- xxxd3456xxx  analogs for
wild-type and mutant 5ht3rs. pki values for the analogs interacting
with the w90f (쎲) and the r92a (䊊) mutants (table 1) were compared with those for the wild-type receptor. the solid lines represent
linear fits to the data. the r2 values for the fits were 0.79 and 0.74 for
w90f vs wild-type, and r92a vs wild-type, respectively.

in this study, we have extended these studies to
include analysis of the interaction of the analogs with
two mutant receptors that have been shown to have altered affinity for d- xxxd3456xxx . one of these mutations
(w90f) reduces the affinity for d- xxxd3456xxx , while the
other (r92a) increases the affinity. these two residues
are found in a region of the  xxxg1116xxx  that we have shown
forms a beta-strand structure (yan et al., 1999), and is homologous to the “loop d” region of the achr binding
site (corringer et al., 2000). in support of the notion that
this region plays a role in ligand–receptor interaction, the
recent determination of the structure of the acetylcholine
binding protein (achbp) from lymnea (brejc et al.,
2001) demonstrates that the homologous region in the
achbp is in a beta-strand conformation and forms part of
the so-called “complementary face” of the ligand-binding domain. thus, mutations at these sites might be
expected to affect ligand–receptor interactions.
both mutations affect the interaction of d- xxxd3456xxx 
and the analogs with the receptor, but in different
fashions. the w90f mutation, which reduces the affinity
for d- xxxd3456xxx  and other antagonists (yan et al.,
1999), reduces the affinity of most of the analogs to a
similar extent. the fact that the analogs are affected to
more or less the same extent suggests that while this
residue may play a role in determining the environment
of the ligand-binding site, it probably does not make a
specific interaction with d- xxxd3456xxx  at the 2, 2’, 7’,
12’, or 13’positions of the molecule (the positions that
are modified in the analogs). if w90 did make specific
interactions with one of these portions of the molecule,
then one might expect to see a differential effect of the

371

w90f mutation on the affinities of one or more analogs.
for example, if w90f interacted directly with position
13’on d- xxxd3456xxx , one might expect to see a differential effect of the mutation on the affinities of those analogs modified at that position (iodo–d- xxxd3456xxx ,
bromo–d- xxxd3456xxx , sulfo–d- xxxd3456xxx ) relative to
analogs modified at other positions. instead, we observe
more or less the same effect: a 2–4-fold reduction in
affinity for each analog relative to wild-type receptors.
this suggests strongly that w90 does not make a specific
interaction with at least those portions of the d- xxxd3456xxx  molecule that have been modified.
two of the analogs ( xxxd2625xxx  and 12’o-methylchondrocurine) show a slight increase in affinity towards
the w90f receptors rather than the decrease observed
for the other analogs. both analogs are methylated at the
2 and12’ positions, which might suggest that there may
be a specific interaction between the 2 and/or 12’ portion
of d- xxxd3456xxx  and w90. however, other analogs
have the same substitutions (2 position: chondocurine
and 7’-o-methyl-chondocurine; 12’ position: o,o-dimethyl-tubocurine) but do not show an increase in affinity.
this suggests that substitutions at positions 2 and/or 12’
are not responsible for the observed difference between
the effects of the w90 mutation on the interaction of
 xxxd2625xxx  and 12’-o-methyl-chondocurine with the
receptor compared to the other analogs. while we are
unsure as to why these two analogs behave differently
with respect to the effect of the w90f mutation, our
original conclusion that w90 does not make a specific
interaction with at least those portions of the d- xxxd3456xxx  molecule that have been modified is probably
correct.
although the r92a mutation results in an increase in
affinity for d- xxxd3456xxx  and the other analogs relative
to wild-type, the fact that once again all analogs are
affected more or less to the same extent relative to wildtype receptors indicates that r92 also does not make specific high-affinity interactions with the substituents at the
2, 2’, 7’, 12’, or 13’ positions of d- xxxd3456xxx . the
increase in affinity could be due to either the removal
of the positive charge of the arginine side chain and/or
a steric effect due to replacement of the bulky guanidinium side chain (volume = 140.5 å3) of arginine with the
smaller methyl group side chain (volume=28.7 å3) of the
alanine (zamyatnin, 1984). if the presence of a positive
charge in the binding site created an environment that
reduced the affinity of d- xxxd3456xxx , then substitution
of alanine would remove the polarity/electrostatic effect
and result in an increased affinity. alternately, if the
bulky arginine side chain affected the positioning of the
large d- xxxd3456xxx  molecule in the binding site preventing optimal orientation within the ligand-binding
site, then removal of the bulky side chain might allow
a better fit of d- xxxd3456xxx  within the binding site. in

372

either case, the affinity would increase after the r92a
mutation.
while the data at hand do not make it possible to
unequivocally distinguish between an electrostatic versus steric mechanism for the increase in affinity, the evidence suggests that the increase in affinity is not likely
due to an electrostatic effect. if the presence of a positive
charge in the binding site might create an electrostatic
repulsion between the guanidinium and one of the two
charged nitrogens in d- xxxd3456xxx , then removal of the
positive charge in the binding site might be expected to
increase the affinity of d- xxxd3456xxx  for the binding
site. while this is observed, the fact that the affinities
for two other ligands (serotonin and granisetron) which
also contain “equivalent” positively charged nitrogens
(from a pharmacophore standpoint (hibert et al., 1990))
are decreased by removal of the guanidinium side chain
(yan et al., 1999), opposite to what might be expected.
in addition, sulfo–d- xxxd3456xxx  is negatively charged
at position 13’, and one might expect that if the positive
charge on r92 were important in d- xxxd3456xxx –receptor interaction, that (a) sulfo–d- xxxd3456xxx  would have
a higher affinity than d- xxxd3456xxx , and (b) removal of
the positive charge through the r92a mutation would
result in a decrease in the affinity of sulfo–d- xxxd3456xxx . the fact that neither of these two are observed once
again suggests that in the case of d- xxxd3456xxx –receptor interactions, the positive charge of r92 does not play
an important role in determining affinity, and that the
increase in affinity seen after the r92a mutation is due
to replacing a bulky side chain with a smaller one,
allowing the large d- xxxd3456xxx  molecule to “fit” better
in the ligand-binding site of the mutant receptor.
the data presented in this study suggest that neither
w90 nor r92 (and by inference the rest of this particular
loop of the ligand-binding site) appear to form specific
interactions with d- xxxd3456xxx . in support of this,
examination of the high-resolution structure of the
achbp (brejc et al., 2001) shows that hepes (which
co-crystallized in the ligand-binding site and makes the
cation-pi interactions with aromatic residues in the binding site expected of achr ligands) does not appear to
make any close contacts with residues in the beta-strand
containing the homologous tryptophan residue (w b53
in the achbp structure). rather, this particular region
of the protein appears to form part of the bottom and
side of the cleft of the binding site cavity in the achbp.
given the great deal of sequence homology between the
 xxxg1116xxx  and the achbp, the two binding sites probably
have similar geometries, and mutations in this region
could affect ligand binding by altering the walls of the
cavity, thus affecting how the ligand fits within the binding site. expansion of this type of study to mutations in
other portions of the putative binding domain and other
ligands can help to define the actual interactions that a
ligand makes with the ligand-binding site and thus pro-

vide useful information for the design of potent and
selective pharmacological agents.
