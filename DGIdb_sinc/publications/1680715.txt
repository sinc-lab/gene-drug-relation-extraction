ligand binding studies with wb 4101 revealed that the rat aorta contains botb the a,=- and a,,-adrenoceptor
subtypes.
results obtained following treatment with the irreversible antagonists phenoxybenzamine,
chlorethylclonidine
or szl-49
~4-amino-6,7-dimethoxy-2-quinazolinyl-4-~2-bi~clo[2,2,2]octa-2,5-dienylcarbonyl-2-piper~ine)
suggest that there is a complex
interaction between the a,-adrenoceptor
subtypes in the aorta. chlorethylclonidine affects only the a,,-adrenoceptor,
whereas
the predominant action of szl-49 is on the ala-subtype. chlorethylclonidine
significantly inhibited the response to either
 xxxd2601xxx  or phenylephrine,
agents which are selective ala -adrenoceptor agonists. following inactivation with either
chlorethylclonidine or szl-49, the response of the rat aorta to phenylephrine was only partially antagonized by either  xxxd3000xxx 
or wb 4101. szl-49 also inhibited the response of the rat tail artery to electrical stimulation. the response of the tail artery
obtained following inactivation with szl-49 was effecrively antagonized by  xxxd3000xxx . phenylephrine,  xxxd3000xxx  or wb 4101
afforded complete protection from chlorethylclonidine
adrenoceptor inactivation, while these same ligands were only partially
effective against szl-49. either szl-49 or chlorethylclonidine
significantly impaired the irreversible adrenoceptor blocking
actions of phenoxybenzamine. these results suggest: (1) only the a,,-adrenoceptor
subtype appears to be associated with nerve
terminals in the tail artery, (2) there may be a complex interaction between the cy,-adrenoceptor subtypes such that both
receptors must be intact ar:j functional to observe normal agonist and antagonist interactions, (3; there may be three sites of
action for agonists associated with the rat aorta.

1. introduction
the subdivision of the cy,-adrenoceptor into alaand a,,-subtypes has been proposed (mcgrath, 1982;
morrow and creese, 1986). minneman and coworkers
have taken a pharmacological approach to provide a
strong base of data in support of this classification
scheme (see minneman, 1988 for a review). an important finding from these investigations was that wb
4101 exhibits high (a,,) and low (c~,,) affinity for the
different
cu,-adrenoceptor
subtypes (morrow and
creese, 1986; minneman, 1988; minneman et al., 1988).
it has also been shown that chlorethylclonidine inactivates mainly the a,,-subtype (han et al., 1987; minneman, 1988; minneman et al., 1988). most tissues such
as the heart, kidney and brain have been shown to
contain populations of both adrenoceptor
subtypes
(han et al., 1987; minneman et al., 1988). the liver was

a notable exception containing only the cur,-adrenoceptor. recently terman et al. (1990) have used a biochemical approach to provide good evidence for the
existence of a,-adrenoceptor subtypes. after a greater
than 500-fold purification these authors found evidence of only one adrenoceptor
in the liver. this
receptor had low affinity for wb 4101 and was sensitive to chlorethylclonidine.
they also obtained evidence for two adrenoceptors purified from’brain. these
receptors exhibited high and low affinity for wb 4101
and only the low affinity wb 4101 site was inactivated
by chlorethylclonidine.
this laboratory has also been involved in the characterization of cy,-adrenoceptor subtypes and has used an
alkylating analog of  xxxd3000xxx , szl-49, as both an in
vivo and in vitro probe for the cq-adrenoceptor subtypes (kusiak et al., 1989; piascik et al., 1988; 1989;
1990b,c). in contrast to chlorethylclonidine, this ligand
completely inactivates the a,,-adrenoceptor
while producing an incomplete, non dose-dependent reduction
in the cu,,-adrenoceptor (piascik et al., 1990bl. we
have previously used szl-49 to study the role played
by cy,-adrenoceptor subtypes in the regulation of vascu-

cle responsiveness and systemic arterial
(ku&k et al., 1989: piascik et al., 1988;
n these present studies we have used the combinalclonidine and szl-49 to study the
retribution
made by each subtype to the overall function
of vascular smooth muscle. we have obtained
unexpected and complicated results consistent with the
idea that there is a complex interaction between the
cr,-adrenoceptor subtypes.

aterials and methods
male sprague-dawley rats (250-350 g) were used in
all aspects of this work.
2. i. preparatiotl of isolateii aortic rings

aortic rings were prepared as described previously
from this laboratory (kusiak et al., 1989; piascik et al.,
19~s: 199ob). the entire thoracic aorta was removed
and randomly assigned to a drug treatment group. no
attempt was made to remove the endothelium. briefly,
the aorta was removed, cut into 3-4 mm rings, placed
between stainless steel muscle clips, suspended in glass
jacketed tissue baths under constant oxygenation (95%

contained krebs-henseleit buffer of the following composition: 120 mm naci, 5.6 mm kci, 2.5 mm  xxxg2125xxx ,,
1.3 mm mgcl,, 1.2 mm kh?po:, 25.3 mm nacho,,
10 mm glucose, 1 pm propranolol and 10 pm edta.
the muscle clips were attached via surgical silk thread
to grass ft-03 force displacement transducers and
resting tension adjusted to 1 g. the aortic rings were
allowed to equilibrate for approximately 2 h with repeated washing. agonist dose-response curves were
performed in cumulative fashion beginning at 1 nm
and increased by one-half log unit to 1 mm. for all
dose-response curves each tissue received every agonist
concentration. previous work by us (piascik et al., 1988;
1990a, b, kusiak et al., 1989) and others (suzuki et al.,
1990; tian et a!., 19901 have shown that after treatment
-with either chlorethylclonidine or szl-49 the maximal
response to agonists is not decreased. however, a
higher agonist concentration was necessary to achieve
this maximal response. in these studies the maximal
response of the aorta was determined by the addition
of 1 mm norepinephrine added at the conclusion of
each dose-response curve. all contractile data are exmessed as a percentage of this maximal response. the
highest dose of phenylephrine always produced a response equal to that of norepinephrine. the  xxxd2601xxx  response was always less that the maximal response obtainable with the tissue. in several figures
(figs. lb, 2, 3, 6, 7) many data points are clustered at 1

mm phenylephrine and the response level of 100%.
this clustering obscures some of the data points. however in the figures in question all dose-response curves
achieve a maximal value equal to that observed with
the addition of 1 mm norepinephrine.
2.2, drug protocols

severa! protocols were used to study the at-adrenoceptor subtypes in the aortic ring preparation. protocol 1: when the effect of szl-49 or chlorethylclonidine
was studied, the alkylator was incubated with the aortic
rings for 30 min, after which time the rings were
washed free of  xxxd3249xxx  for 2 h. agonist responses were then reassessed. protocol 2: the ability of
 xxxd3000xxx  or wb 4101 to antagonize agonist-induced
contractions was evaluated following treatment and
washout of chlorethylclonidine and szl-49. the competitive antagonists were incubated with the aorta 20
min prior to generation of the dose-response curves.
an antagonist incubation time of 50 min produced
essentially the same degree of rightward shift of the
agonist dose-response curves as did the 20 min incubation period. protocol 3: the ability of phenylephrine,
 xxxd3000xxx  or wb 4101 to block the antagonist effects of
chlorethylclonidine
or szl-49 was studied in the following manner: rings were incubated with either 100
fm phenylephrine, g.1 pm  xxxd3000xxx  or 0.1 ;?m wb
4101 for 5 (chlorethylclonidine)
or 20 (szl-49) min
prior to the addition of chlorethylclonidine or szl-49,
then the drugs were incubated together for 5 (szl-49)
or 30 (chlorethylclonidine)
min followed by a 4 h
washout period. agonist dose-response curves were
then prepared. protocol 4: in another series of experiments, aortic rings were inactivated by szl-49 or
chlorethylclonidine
as described in protocol 1. these
same rings were then incubated with phenoxybenzamine for 10 min. phenoxybenzamine was then washed
out for 1 h. again agonist dose-response curves were
prepared.
2.3. preparation of tail artery rings
arteries were removed from the ventral surface of
the rat tail and placed in a physiological sah solution of
the following composition: 130 mm naci, 4.7 mm kci,
1.6 mm caci,, 1.17 mm mgcl,, 1.18 mm kh,po,,
14.9 mm nahco,, 5.5 mm glucose and 30 pm edta.
with the aid of a dissecting microscope the vessels
were cleaned of fat and connective tissue and cut into
3 mm ring segments obtained from the proximal end of
the artery. no attempt was made to remove the endothelium. two tungsten wires were placed through
the lumen of the vessels. one wire was attached to a
grass ft-03 force displacement transducer and the
ather to a fixed base. arterial rings were suspended in

water-jacketed tissue baths containing the physiologic
salt solution maintained at 37°c under constant oxygenation. one gram of resting tension was placed on
the arterial segments. changes in contractile force
were recorded by means of a grass model 7 polygraph.
following a 90 min equilibration period, a control
frequency-response curve was generated using a grass
s88 stimulator and platinum wire electrodes placed
parallel to the tissues (0.1-24 hz, 10 v (25 a), 0.3 ms
duration, 3 ms delay). after this initial frequency-response curve the tissues were equilibrated for 30 min
in the physiologic salt solution to allow the vessels to
restabilize at the baseline passive force. the tissues
were incubated with various concentrations of szl-49
for 30 min after which time the antagonist was washed
out for 90 min. a frequency-response curve was generated following the wash out period. in another set of
experiments a frequency-response curve was generated
following inactivation and washout of 100 nm szl-49.
the vessels were then incubated with either 100 nm
 xxxd3000xxx  or yohimbine for 10 min. a second frequency-response curve was obtained in the presence of
these antagonists. time control tissues were studied to
show that there was no decrement in response to
repeated electrical stimulation of the vessels. responses to electrical stimulation in the presence of
antagonists were expressed as a percent of the maximal
response at 24 hz obtained in the initial control frequency-response curve. stimulation frequencies higher
than 30 hz were not used. this is because these
frequencies depolarized not only the nerve but the
smooth muscle directly.
2.4. membrane preparation
to prepare membranes from aorta, microsomes were
first prepared from rat aorta as described by piascik et
al. (1983). ten to fifteen aortas were required to perform a single binding assay. these microsomes were
then centrifuged through a percoll gradient as originally described by prpic et al. (1984) and used by han
et al. (1990) for the study of a,-adrenoceptors
subtypes.
2.5. quantitation of [3h/ xxxd3000xxx  binding
the ability of wb 4101 to displace [3h] xxxd3000xxx 
from sites on the aortic preparation was assessed in a 2
ml volume. the reactions contained 50 mm  xxxd3449xxx 
(ph = 7.5),5 mm mgcl,, 0.1%  xxxd228xxx , 500 ~1 of
membrane
protein,
[ 3h] xxxd3000xxx 
and increasing
amounts of wb 4101. the concentration of  xxxd3000xxx 
was fixed at approximately its dissociation constant for
the cu,-adrenoceptor (50-75 pm). specific binding was
determined in the presence of 10 pm  xxxd2914xxx .
the binding reaction was allowed to proceed for 30

min at 25°c. reactions were terminated by rapid fihration onto whatman gf/b filters. the filters were
washed 4 times with 4 ml of ice cold sodium phosphate
buffer (ph = 7.4, 81 mm tva,hpo, and 9 mm
ki-i,po,). the amount of radioactivity retained on the
filters was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting
using a packard 300 c liquid scintillation spectrophotometer.
2.6. statistical analysis
means, s.e.m. or 95% confidence limits were calculated for all data. ed,, and confidence limits were
calculated as described by goldstein (1964). pa2 values were calculated by the method of arunlakshana
and schild (1959). dose ratios were calculated in the
linear portion of the dose-response curve at response
values of 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70% of maximum.
these values were the region of the dose-response
curve where the antagonists induced dose-dependent
shifts. methods for analyzing the dose-response cm-:es
were taken from tallarida and jacob (1979) and previously used by us (babich et al., 1989; piascik et al.,
1990b). all points in the dose-response curve were fit
to a straight line by linear regression analysis. when all
points were included i.1 the analysis, the data could not
be fit to a straight line. points on the upper and lower
end of the curve were eliminated one at a time until
the data could be fit to a straight line without significant deviations. this procedure essentially eliminated
the tails of the dose-response curve. in certain instances (see results for details), even after elimination
of the tails of the dose-response curve the data could
not be fit to a single straight line without significant
deviations. in this situation, data could, however, be fit
to two lines without significant deviations. a fit to two
straight lines without deviations was used as the criteria for a dose-response curve being described as biphasic. in plotting the data it would have been preferable
to include the s.e.m. on the dose-response curves.
this value was routinely very small and in most instances would be encompassed in the data point or
only slightly protrude. in other instances, the presence
of error bars on figures with several dose-response
curves would make the data presentation confusing
and difficult to interpret. therefore, error bars were
not included in the figures. all binding data were
analyzed by the iterative curve fitting program
ligand (munson and rodbard, 1980).
2.7. drugs
all drug soiutions were prepared fresh daily. szl-49
was synthesized as described by pitha et al. (19891,
dissolved in dmso and diluted in saline. phenylephrine-hcl and  xxxd2601xxx -hcl
were purchased

al co. (st. louis, mo) and diszosin-hc1 was also obtained from
icohol and diluted in saline. phent~~~~~~~e-hc1ws obtained from ciba-geigy (summit,
) and dissolved in  xxxd102xxx  and diluted in
e buffer used in binding assays. chlorethylclonidinei-icl(dissolved in saline) and wi3 4101-hcl (dissolved
in saline) were purchased from research biochemicals
(natick, ma).

e ability of wb 4101 to displace [‘hlprazosin
from sites on the rat aorta was assessed. wb 4101
interacted with ho sites labelled by [‘hlprazosin (see
table ii. these sites exhibited high (53.7 pm) and low
affinity (79 r&l) for wb 4iol. the affinity estimates
are in good agreement with those previously reported
for wb 4101 interaction with cu,-adrenoceptor subtypes (morrow and creese, 1986). the [“hlprazosin
site which exhibits high affinity for wb 4101 is designated as (y,~.while the low affinity site is designated
cy,~.there were more adrenoceptors which exhibited
low affinity for wb 4101 (57 versus 43%).
 xxxd2601xxx  has been previously shown to be a
selective a,,-adrenoceptor
agonist (tsujimoto et al.,
1989). the ability of  xxxd2601xxx  to induce contraction of rat aortic rings was studied in control rings and
rings treated with either szl-49 or chlorethylclonidine.
 xxxd2601xxx  was a partial agonist producmg a response so-90% of that obtainable with norepinephrine
(see fig. 1). when analyzed as described in the methods. the control  xxxd2601xxx  dose-response curve was
biphasic consisting of high (o-o.5pm) and low (> 0.5
,um) affinity components. both chlorethylclonidine and
szl-49 blocked the contractile actions of  xxxd2601xxx 
(see fig. 1a). after treatment with chlorethylclonidine
the metho.xamine curve was still biphasic, while that
observed after szl-49 was monophasic and made up
of only low affinity responses. phenylephrine is another
agonist which exhibits high affinity for the ala-adrenoceptor (morrow and creese, 1986; piascik et al., 1990a,

phrine was equal to that obtained with norepincphrine.
while not as apparent as that seen with  xxxd2601xxx ,
the control phenylephrine dose-response curve was also
biphasic (see fig. 1b). we have previously observed
hiphasic dose-response curves for both norepinephrine
and phenylephrine (piascik et al., 1990b). the effects
of chlorethylclonidine
and szl-49 on the phenylephrine response were very similar to that seen with
 xxxd2601xxx  (biphasic curves with chlorethylclonidine,
monophasic curves with szl-49).
in control rings  xxxd3000xxx  or wb 4101 were potent
inhibitors of the actions of phenylephrine, (see fig. 2a
and b). these antagonists shifted the phenylephrine
curve to the right. the biphasic nature of the dose-response curve is even more apparent after antagonist
treatment. the response to high concentrations of
phenylephrine were not blocked in a dose-dependent
fashion by the antagonists. as a result; at higher agonist concentrations,
all the dose-response curves appeareu to overlap. when the data for wb 4101 were
plotted according to the schild equation (arunlakshana and schild, 19591, the slope of the line was
not significantly different from 1 (0.86 + 0.26). the

283

calculated k, for wb 4101 was 52.4 + 35.2 pm. the
schild plot for  xxxd3000xxx  inhibition had a slope not
significantly different from 1 (0.87 f 0.12) and revealed
a k, for  xxxd3000xxx  of 29.5 + 14.8 pm. the k, values
estimated for these compounds using  xxxd2601xxx  as
the agonist were 54.9 f 30.3 and 4.5 &-3.5 pm for wb
4101 and  xxxd3000xxx , respectively. the ku for wb 4101
estimated from these functional studies agrees quite
well with the dissociation constant estimated from
binding studies in the aorta for the ala site (53.7 pm,
see table 1).
the antagonist actions of wb 4101 or  xxxd3000xxx  (see
figs. 3 and 4) were still apparent following receptor
inactivation by either slz-49 or chlorethylclonidine.
however, the pattern of inhioition was markedly different. after treatment with chlorethylclonidine, wb 4101
(fig. 3a) or  xxxd3000xxx  (fig. 3b) were not able to effectively antagonize the response to phenylephrine concentrations greater than 100 pm. this resulted in the
dose-response curves obtained in the presence of  xxxd3000xxx  or wb 4101 merging at responses greater than
50%. this indicates that after chlorethylclonidine, wb
4101 or  xxxd3000xxx  was able to block a smaller percentage of the total phenylephrine response than that seen

in control aortic rings. because of the effect on doseresponse curves, we could not analyze the antagonism
seen with wb 4101 or  xxxd3000xxx  by schild analysis. the
slopes of the schild plots were significantly less than 1.
a similar pattern of inhibition for wb 4101 and  xxxd3000xxx  was observed following inactivation of aortic rings
with szl-49 (fig. 4a and b).
a simpler pattern of responses were observed following electrical stimulation of the rat tail artery. increasing the frequency of stimulation resulted in an
increase in contractile tension of the tail artery (see fig.
5a). the frequency-response curves were monophasic.
incubation with increasing amounts of szl-49 resulted
in a progressive shift to the right in the frequency
response curves and decreased the maximal level of the

the ability of phenylephrine,  xxxd3000xxx  and wb 4101
to block the effects of chlorethylclonidine or szl-49
was then examined. these agents were preincubated
with aortic rings prior to the addition of chlorethylclonidine or szl-49 as described in protocol 3 in
metrods. after co-incubation, the rings were washed
cstensively for 4 h and agonist responsiveness assessed.
pretreatment with phenylephrine,  xxxd3000xxx  or wb 4101
completely blocked the effects of chlorethylclonidine
on the phenylephrine response in aortic rings (see fig.
6). these same agents afforded protection from the
antagonist actions of szl-49 (see fig. 7). however,
protection was not complete as was the case with
cb~orethy~clonidine.
following treatment of aortic rings with 1 pm phenol-benzamine the response of the aorta to phenylephrine was completely abolished (see fig. 8a and b).

while a great deal of information is available on
characterization
of a,-adrenoceptor
subtypes, there is
a paucity of information regarding how these adrenoceptors tunction in the concerted regulation of vascular
smooth muscle. we have previously examined the role
of chlorethylclonidine and szl-4psensitive sites in the
regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure (piascik
et al., 1989; 1990a, b, c). in this present report we were
interested in determining if each adrenoceptor alone is
capable of modulating smooth muscle function or if
both receptors are required for normal muscle action.
our approach to this problem was to use chlorethylclonidine, selective for the a,,-adrenoceptor,
and szl49, which eliminates the cu,,-adrenoceptor
and produces an incomplete reduction of the a,,-adrenocep-

285

tor. we also used agonists and antagonists whose interaction with these subtypes has previously been determined. this allowed for a pharmacologic characterization of the sites present after receptor inactivation.
many of the functional studies were carried out in
the rat aorta. it was first necessary to show that this
tissue contained both the ala-and a,,-adrenoceptor
subtype. table 1 presents the results of this determination. wb 4101 interacted with both high and low
affinity sites labelled by [3h] xxxd3000xxx . the estimates
for the high affinity site are in very good agreement
with previous reports for wb 4101 interaction with
[3h] xxxd3000xxx  (morrow and creese, 1986; terman et al.,

1990). the presence of high and low affinity sites for
wb 4101 have been used by several workers to define
a,-adrenoceptor
subtypes. the fact that the rat aorta
contains both high and low affinity sites for wb 4101
indicate that this tissue contains both the ala- and
a,,-adrenoceptor
subtypes. the distribution of sites
seen in the aorta (43% high, 57% low) are different
than for other tissues such as th: brain, heart and
kidney (han et al., 1990; minneman et al., 1988; 1990;
morrow and creese, 1986; terman et al., 1990). there
is disagreement between our estimztts of the affinity of

represent differences in the a,,-adrenoceptor
of the
aorta and that of other tissues. the discrepancy could
also reflect the difficulty in making estimates for sites
which possess low ligand affinity. finally the differences could indicate that the (y,,-adrenoceptor was not
labelled in a:1 cases or possibily different molecular
forms of the receptor exist. it would have been desirable to study the effects of chlorethylclonidine
and
szl-49 in the aorta. however, considering the numbers of animals (lo-15 are necessary for a single binding assay) and amount of chemically reactive compound needed (especially szl-49, which we synthesize
ourselves), these experiments were simply not feasible.
tsujimoto et al. (1989) showed that  xxxd2601xxx 
selectively interacts with the a,,-adrenoceptor
of rabbit
aorta. we have previously demonstrated that phenylephrine can interact with high affinity at the ala- and
low affinity at the (y,~eadrenoceptor of the rat aorta
and heart (piascik et cl., b9yoa,b). in this present
study the control dose-response curares for these agonists were biphasic. this agrees with previous observations (piascik et al., 1990b). interpreted in light of the
points made above, it is natural to suggest tl:dt the

reason we observed biphasic dose-response curves is
the presence of two adrenoceptors of al-character, the
ala and a,,,. agonists such as  xxxd2601xxx  or phenylephrine are capable of interacting with either site. because of the presence of two sites and the high affinity
these ligands show for the lu,,-adrenoceptor subtype,
the agonist dose-response curves would be biphasic.
the a,,-adrenoceptor
would be responsible for the
high affinity portion of the dose-response curve. indeed, the estimates of the k, for wb 4101 antagonism
of the contractile response agree with its dissociation
constant at the a,,-site determined in binding studies.
the low affinity, cy,,-adrenoceptor would be responsible for the low affinity component of the dose-response
curve. following treatment with chlorethylclonidine or
szl-49, the cy,-adrenoceptor remaining ialb in the
case of szl-49, ala in the case of chlofithylclonidine)
would still be available for agonist interaction and
contribute to the observed response. unfortunately our
data do not completely support this simple interpretation and indicate that there may be a complex interaction between the (y,-adrenoceptor subtypes.
there is good evidence to suggest that chlorethylclonidine inactivates the cu,,-adrenoceptor (see introduction and cited references). therefore, following
treatment qf a tissue with chlorethylclonidine, such as
the rat xv-q, which contains both the ala- and al,,adrenoceptors subtypes, the tissue still should have a
functional cu,,-adrenoceptor at which agonists and antagonists can interact. based on this line of reasoning,
it would be predicted that treatment of the rat aorta
with chlorethylclonidine
(selective for the a,,-adrenoceptor) would have little effect on the actions of agents
such as  xxxd2601xxx  or phenylephrine which interact
with high affinity at the a,,-subtype. the results presented in fig. 1a and b clearly show that this is not the
case. chlorethylclonidine (100 pm) significantly shifted
the dose response curve for either agonist. these results are not easily reconciled with the concept that
chlorethylclonidine only inactivates the q,-adrenoceptor. this suggests one of two possibilities. first, in the
rat aorta, chlorethylclonidine
is capable of modifying
the a,,-adrenoceptor.
this possibility is not supported
by the available data with chlorethylclonidine.
it has
been shown by several laboratories that the effects of
chlorethylclonidine,
either applied to membranes or
administered in vivo, are selective for the ru,,-adrenoceptor (see cited references). in addition, terman et al.
(1990) have provided evidence which suggest that the
ala- and a,,-adrenoceptors
differ in their amino acid
composition such that the cy,,-adrenoceptor but not
the cr,,-adrenoceptor
can be modified by chlorethylclonidine. a second possibility is that both the ala- and
the a,,,-adrenoceptor
subtypes must be intact and functional to observe the normal response of agonists and
antagonists. with the a a,,-adrenoceptor
modified by

287

chlorethylclonidine,
the ability of either  xxxd2601xxx 
or phenylephrine to activate the cr,,-site is impaired.
ii chlorethylcionidine or szl-49 simply inactivated
one of the a,-adrenoceptor
subtypes, then the subsequent response should still be sensitive to selective
blockade by pharmacologic antagonists of a,-adrenoceptors. wb 4101 has been shown to interact with high
affinity at the a,,-adrenoceptor
(morrow and creese,
1986; minneman, 1988; terman et al., 1990).  xxxd3000xxx ,
while not selective, interacts with high affinity at either
a,-subtype (morrow and creese, 1986; minneman,
1988). indeed, in control experiments (see fig. 2), we
showed that the estimated dissociation constants of
these ligands were in the picomolar range. it would be
anticipated that following treatment with an agent like
chlorethylclonidine, which alkylates the a,,-adrenoceptor, ligands such as wb 4101 and  xxxd3000xxx , which
interact with high affinity at the a,,-adrenoceptor
would still be potent antagonists and as such induce
progressive shifts to the right in the dose-response
curve. after inactivation with either chlorethylclonidine or szl-49 the inhibitory pattern seen with wb
4101 or  xxxd3000xxx  was complex. a simple parallel shift
to the right was not observed. approximately 50% of
the total response to either  xxxd2601xxx  or phenylephrine was blocked by these antagonists (see figs. 3-4).
this indicates that only a portion of the response to
agonists seen after receptor inactivation is mediated by
a receptor which has cu,-characteristics. the response
to high concentrations of the agonists was not blocked
by  xxxd3000xxx  or wb 4101 resulting in overlap of the
dose-response curves. this implies that after inactivation with chlorethylclonidine or szl-49, a component
of the response to agonist action was mediated by a
site which does not have the character of an cy,-adrenoceptor. it also suggests that ligands such as chloroethylonidine or szl-49 inactivate the high affinity cy,adrenoceptors, revealing a low affinity non-adrenergic
site. we have previously obtained data with szl-49
supporting this (piascik et al., 1988). the existence of a
low affinity non-adrenergic site has previously been
proposed and referred to as a ‘y receptor’ (hirst and
nield, 1980) or extrareceptor
(bevan, 1984). these
data suggest that there actually may be multiple sites of
interaction for agonists on the rat aorta, the cu,-adrenoceptor subtypes and this poorly characterized nonadrenergic site. indeed the control dose-response
curves reported in fig. 2 also provide evidence for this
low affinity non-adrenergic site. the response to high
agonist concentrations is not blocked by either  xxxd3000xxx  or wb 4101, resulting in overlapping dose-response curves.
both chlorethylclonidine and szl-49 are chemically
reactive compounds. this suggests the possibility of
nonspecific effects due to this chemical reactivity.
non-specific modification of the receptor or second

messenger pathways could reduce agonist responsiveness and be responsible for the unusual pattern of
agonist effects seen above. this does not appear to be
the case with chlorethylclonidine. the antagonist actions of chlorethylclonidine were completely blocked
by pretreatment with phenylephrine,  xxxd3000xxx  or wb
4101 (see fig. 6). these agents all interact selectively
with a,-adrenoceptors.
classically, one of the tests to
show that an irreversible antagonist acts at the level of
the receptor is the demonstration of receptor protection by ligands which interact in a reversible fashion at
the receptor. the fact that the actions of chlorethylclonidine were blocked can be taken as evidence that
its inhibitory actions are due exclusively to interactions
at a,-adrenoceptors.
with the receptor blocked, there
is no site to which chlorethylclonidine can bind. suprisingly, this type of receptor protection experiment has
never been done with chlorethylclonidine. the antagonist actions of szl-49 were blocked by prior treatment
with phenylephrine,  xxxd3000xxx  or wb 4101. however,
the blockade was not complete, indicating that only a
portion of the inhibitory action of szl-49 is due to
direct interaction at a,-adrenoceptors.
the lack of
complete protection suggests that szl-49 may have a
more complex spectrum of action than chlorethylclonidine. szl-49 is hydrophobic and could partition into
tissues and be siowly released. this tissue depoting
could serve as a long-lasting source of the drug. szl-49
could also directly interfere with smooth muscle or the
generation of second messengers. we do have good
evidence that szl-49 is nor a non-specific receptor
antagonist which indiscriminately interferes with receptor function. szl-49 does not affect muscarinic, &-, or
az-adrenocept.,rs, the contractile actions of histamine,
serotonin, kc1 or  xxxg2125xxx , (kusiak et al., 1989; piascik et
al., 1988) or the ability of muscarinic receptors to
enhance the formation of inositol phosphates. therefore, the receptor antagonist actions of szl-49 are
directed specifically at the a,-adrenoceptor. alosachie
and godfraind (1986) suggested that  xxxd3000xxx  could
inhibit cgmp phosphodiesterase and via this mechanism increase levels of the cylcic nucleotide in smooth
muscle. if the  xxxd3000xxx  analog, szl-49, has a similar
action then this may account for antagonism unrelated
to cu,-adrenoceptor blockade.
we suggest above that there may be a complex
interaction between the a,-adrenoceptor subtypes. gccupation of one receptor leads to an alteration in the
properties of the other such that normal agonist and
antagonist interactions with the receptor cannot occur.
the intriguing data obtained with phenoxybenzamine
support this possibility. phenoxybenzamine incubated
alone with aortic rings completely abolished the response to phenylephrine. this is not unusual as phenoxybenzamine would be expected to inactivate all
a,-adrenoceptors
in the aorta. surprisingly, in aortic

tiarys that bad been treated with chlorethylclonidine or
l-w. the antagonist actions of phenoxybemmine
e :;gonist actions of phenyler words. treatment with cec or szl-49,
tative subtype selectivity, blocked the
actions of a iigand (phenoxybenzamine)
which can
receptor subtypes. we cannot be certain
ult was obtained. however, it does imply
adrenoceptor subtypes can interact and
inding to one of the subtypes can affect binding
other. chlorethylclonidine or szl-49 may bind
to one subtype preventing phenoxybenzamine access to
the other. if this is true, it would argue that occupation
of one of the receptor subtypes by an agonist has the
potential to affect drug binding to the other.
there has been no previous work on the location
(synaptic or extrasynaptic) of the a,-adrenoceptor
subtypes. this is the first report which has attempted to
localize these receptors. treatment with szl-49 significantly blocked the effect of electrical stimulation on
the contractile state of the tail artery and the maximal
response was markedly reduced at the highest szl-49
concentration (1 fm). after szl-49 inactivation, the
response of the tail artery was very selrsitive to blockade by  xxxd3000xxx  indicating the response was mediated
by an a,-adrenoceptor.
conclusions regarding these
experiments must be tempered with caution because
stimulation frequencies higher than 24 hz no longer
selectively affected the sympathetic nerves but directly
depolarized the muscle. if this direct depolarization
did rat occur, stimulation at higher frequencies may
have revealed a greater response of the artery subsequent to treatment with szl-49. taken at face value,
however, the data suggest that the site eliminated by
szl-49, the ala-adrenoceptor,
is synaptically located.
inactivation of the site significantly reduces the effect
of electrical stimulation. the fact that the magnitude
of the response was nearly abolished indicates that
there were few a,,-adrenoceptors
located at the neuroeffector junction. if a,,-sites were present, then these
receptors would have been available to mediate the
response to stimulation. the fact that chlorethylclonidine
had no antagonist activity also supports the
notion that ru,,-sites are not synaptically located. indeed chlorethylclonidine
administration caused contraction of the tail artery. we have never observed
any
agonist action of chlorethylclonidine on the aorta or in
blood pressure studies. however there are reports that
cblorethylclonidine can induce smooth muscle contraction (leclerc et al., 1980; tian et al., 1990).
in summary, we have used the aorta as a model
tissue which contains both the cola- and a,,-adrenoceptars to obtain evidence that there may be a complex
interaction between these receptor subtypes. furthermore, we show that there may actually be three sites of
action on aortic smooth muscle for adrenoceptor
ago-

nists, the cu,-adrenoceptor subtypes and a poorly defined low affinity non-a,-site. finally we show that at
least the a,,-adrenoceptor
is associated with the neuroeffector

junction.
