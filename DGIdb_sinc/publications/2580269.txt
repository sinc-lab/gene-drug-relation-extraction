on single ca 2+-activated k+-channels
in arterial and intestinal smooth muscle cell membranes

abstract. the interaction of ba 2+ and tea with ca 2+activated k + channels was studied in isolated membrane
patches of cells from longitudinal jejunal smooth muscle of
rabbit and from guinea-pig small mesenteric artery (100 ~tm
external diameter). ba 2+ applied from the inside of the
membrane did not reduce unit current, except at high concentrations, but channels failed to open for long periods
(s). this effect became much stronger when the potential
gradient was in a direction driving ba 2+ into the channel
and was reduced by increasing k + ion concentration on the
outside of the membrane. these results are consistent with
ba 2 + entering the open channel and blocking at a site most
of the way through the channel bore. in contrast, tea and
procaine dose-dependently reduced unit current amplitude
at all patch potentials and slightly increased mean open time.
their effects were not detectably voltage-dependent and
could be explained by tea and procaine blocking the open
channel with a timecourse that was faster than the frequency
response of the recording system. the lack of appreciable
voltage-dependence suggests that tea and procaine bind to
a site near to the inner mouth of the channel.

introduction
barium and tetraethylammonium (tea) ions have pronounced effects on the form of the electrical activity recorded
from smooth muscle tissues. barium has been described as
increasing the duration of the action potential, causing the
development of a long plateau in some muscles (suzuki et
al. 1964; hotta and tsukui 1968; btilbring and tomita
1969; sakamoto 1970; walsh and singer 1980). depolarization and increase in the input resistance have also been
reported implying a decrease in the potassium permeability
(bfilbring and tomita 1969; sakamoto 1970; harder and
sperelakis 1978). in voltage-clamp studies on smooth muscle
strips, barium was able to carry the inward current but
not to activate a transient outward, presumably potassium
current (weigel et al. 1979). it reduced outward current in
voltage-clamped single ceils of rabbit jejunum (benham et
al. 1984b).
tea has somewhat similar effects on the electrical activity of smooth muscles: depolarization, increase in input

resistance, and broadening of the action potential have all
been described, although plateau formation seems not to be
so marked as with barium. procaine has been described as
having somewhat similar actions and it has been suggested
that both tea and procaine may reduce both the resting
potassium permeability and that activated during the action
potential. they markedly increase the excitability of some
normally inexcitable smooth muscles (see review, bolton
1979) and reduce 42k efflux (casteels et al. 1977; imaizumi
and watanabe 1981),
more complete examination of the actions of these
blocking agents has been possible in other tissues. ba z+
ions have been described as a potent blocker of several k +
conductances, including a c a 2 +-activated k + conductance
in aplysia neurones (herman and gorman 1979; armstrong
and taylor 1980; eaton and brodwick 1980). the voltage
dependence of ba 2 + binding to these channels and to the
inward rectifier (ohmori et al. 1981) suggested a binding
site more than halfway through the membrane electric field
(armstrong and taylor 1980; eaton and brodwick 1980).
ba z + ions also carry inward current through ca 2 + channels
in various types of neurones (kostyuk 1981 ; reuter et al.
1982).
tea is known to reduce k + conductance in squid axon
where it has a single internal site of action (armstrong and
binstock 1965). further work with tea suggested that it
enters the k + channel from the axoplasm and blocks it at a
site near the channel mouth (armstrong 1975). however the
action of tea varies considerably in potency and apparent
binding site from tissue to tissue (for a review see stanfield
1983).
the application of the single channel recording technique
(hamill et al. 1981) to mammalian (benham and bolton
1983) and amphibian smooth muscle (singer and walsh
1984) has provided a means for directly investigating the
mechanism of action of these compounds in smooth muscle
tissues, in which there are problems in applying classical
voltage clamp techniques (bolton et al. 1981). recently, the
action of ba 2 + on single channel currents through ca 2 +
activated k + channels from t-tubules of rabbit skeletal muscle has been described (vergara and latorre 1983).
a preliminary report of some of this work has already
been published (benham et al. 1983).
methods
single smooth muscle cells were isolated from separated
longitudinal muscle of rabbit jejunum and short segments
of guinea-pig small mesenteric arteries with an external

solution containing collagenase as described previously (benham and bolton 1983; bolton et al. 1984). experiments
were performed on isolated inside-out membrane patches
from these cells as described by hamill et al. (1981) using a
list epc-5 patch clamp apparatus.
the internal solution (bath solution) contained (mm)
naci 6, kc1 126, na hepes 10, nah2po4 1.2, mgc12 1.2,
caclz 2.5 and glucose 11 mm and was buffered to ph 7.2.
the pipette solution either contained this solution or one in
which kc1 was 6 mm and  xxxg2020xxx  126 mm. in some experiments a bicarbonate-buffered saline solution was used. a
high intracellular c a 2 + concentration was used so that caactivated k + channels were maximally activated at all
potentials. vergara and latorre (1983) observed events
suggesting ca 2 + caused blockade at these (mm) concentrations. we did see activity of this type in a few patches.
however in the majority, including all the experiments we
describe here, long closings on control traces were only
observed infrequently (fig. 1 a) and hence would have little
effect on the analysis of ba 2 + blockade.
data was recorded on fm tape and analysis was performed using a bbc micro computer after digitization by a
unilab adc interface. channel openings were defined as
starting when the current trace rose above 75% and
terminating when it fell below 50% of the mean unit channel
current. records were low-pass filtered at i khz (14 db
down) with an 8-pole butterworth filter. under these conditions a test square wave of i ms duration was attenuated
by /0%. we found that with this filter setting the distribution
of open times in control conditions could be described by a
single exponential. the mean open or mean closed time
were obtained from the slope of the line fitted to a semilogarithmic plot of the data by the method of least squares.
except where indicated only patches in which a single
channel was active at high opening probability were used
for the analyses described in this paper.

results

the effects of barium and of tea were examined on the
properties of c a 2 + - a c t i v a t e d potassium channels in smooth
muscle cell membranes. these channels had a conductance
of approximately 200ps in a 126:126mm potassium
gradient, a reversal potential close to 0 mv (fig. 1c), and
were activated by calcium in the range 10 - 9 - 10 - 6 m.
above / 0 - 6 m [ca z+] the channels in many patches were
mainly in the open state over the range of potentials studied
( + 6 0 to - 6 0 mv) (benham et al. 1984a). thus, when the
internal surface of the isolated membrane patch was exposed
to 2.5 mm [ca2+], the probability (p) of a channel being in
the open state at all potentials studied was generally > 0.7.
patches were discarded in which the channels had control p
values of less than 0.7 at any potential and 14% of patches
fell into this category. the channel open state was interrupted by only brief closings of milliseconds duration:
longer (seconds duration) closings were rare in control traces
(fig. l a, fig. 2 legend). in experiments in a 6:126 mm
potassium gradient, the channels had a unit conductance of
about 100 ps and a reversal potential close to the calculated
ek of --78 mv. channel kinetics were similar to those in
126:126 mm potassium gradient. results from both rabbit
jejunum and guinea-pig mesenteric artery patches are included as no differences were observed in the properties of
individual channels from the two cell types.

blockade by barium
the action of barium applied to the inner surface of isolated
inside-out membrane patches was studied. in a 126:126 mm
potassium gradient, 10-3 m barium chloride applied in the
bathing solution caused a drastic reduction in the proportion
of time that the channels spent in the open state at positive
potentials. figure 1 shows activity from a patch containing
a single active channel. in the presence of barium, bursts of
channel openings were separated by long apparently closed

periods of seconds duration. the effect of barium was
voltage-dependent, so that at more positive potentials,
bursts of channel openings were reduced to brief flickers.
unit current amplitude was unaffected by barium (fig. i c),
except at concentrations greater than 5 mm.
the long closed periods have been suggested to be due
to blockade of the channel by single barium ions (vergara
and latorre 1983). we have adopted a simplified model as
a basis to analyse our data. we have assumed that blockade
is at a single site and that barium can interact only with an
open channel, according to the reaction sequence:

this model has only one closed state and does not provide for burst-type activity. it provides the following explanation for the activity in fig. 1 b: the long apparently closed
periods at - 4 0 mv represent the blocked state o f the
channel while the bursts of activity between non-conducting
periods represent the normal closed-open reaction of the
channel. at strongly positive potentials ( + 40 mv) the
channel enters the blocked state following a high proportion
of openings so that bursts were very short or reduced to
single brief openings.
the kinetics of calcium-activated channels in other
tissues have recently been shown to be complex (magleby
and pallotta 1983a, b; moczydlowski and latorre 1983).
we also observed complex kinetics but by restricting the
bandwidth to 1 khz, open times could be fitted by one
exponential so that mean open times can be considered to
represent sojourns in one open state (fig. 2a).
closed times were also intrinsically complex but by
selecting patches in which long closings (possibly due to
calcium blockade) were rare (fig. 1 a) it was simple to

distinguish the blocked times due to barium blockade. for
example, in the experiment o f fig. 2b, in control conditions,
only i o f 1,000 closings was greater than 250 ms duration.
barium-induced closed periods were of longer duration.
thus, this treatment provided a simplified system in which
to examine the action of barium.
in a patch with only a single channel active under a
126:126 m m potassium gradient, analysis o f data from a
single channel is simple compared to that of multiple
channels (colquhoun and hawkes 1981). f r o m eq. (1) in

in the presence of barium the mean open time iob,, was
determined by the rates of the two reactions leading away
from the open state, i.e. to the closed state and to the open

potential change, tob~ in the presence o f 1 m m [ba 2+] was
strongly potential dependent, decreasing as the patch was
made more positive (fig. 3 a). this was a reflection of the
potential dependence of k~. at negative potentials, few
openings terminated in channel block so toba was mainly
determined by c~. at + 6 0 mv m a n y more openings
terminated in the blocked state than in the closed state as
the blocking rate was about 10-fold faster than the closing

kl[ba], changed e-fold for 16.5 mv potential change. data
points for kl[ba] at - 20 and - 40 mv were ignored when
plotting the straight line as these points were unreliable due
to the small difference between t-oand t'ob,at these potentials
(fig. 3a). the unblocking rate constant k - 1 could be
calculated directly from the data of fig. 2b. as in control
conditions there were very few closed periods longer than
250 ms, the apparent long closings (average duration t'cba)
in the presence of barium were almost entirely due to barium
blockade and thus l/lob, for closings longer than 200 ms

by substitution eq. (4) is obtained.
p and pba were plotted against v for the patch of fig. 1
in fig. 4a. p was little affected by potential but in the presence of 1 m m [ba 2 +], pba decreased sharply at more positive
potentials. using eq. (4) this data could be used to calculate
kd. f o r 3 patches kd (0 mv) obtained from fig. 4 by interpolation was 1.6 + 0.5 x 10 -4 m (mean 4- s.e. of mean) and
changed e-fold per 12.1, 13.5 and 13.7 inv. kd could also be
calculated from the ratio k_ 1/kt to provide an independent
estimate: the value was 0.73 _+_+0.28 x 1 0 - 4 m (table1)
which was not significantly (p > 0.1) different. the similarity of the estimates provides support for the model proposed.
the voltage dependence could be due to the blocking site
for barium being some distance into the channel. if the
blocking site was located at some fractional distance down
the electrical field, this site will be subject to a fraction 6 of
the total applied potential. therefore kd(v) will depend on
the relation:

where ki~ (0 mv) was the dissociation constant at 0 mv, z
the valence of the blocking ion, and f, r, and t had their
usual meanings. the data of fig. 4 b inserted in this equation
gave a value for 6 of 0.96 + 0.04 (n = 3). this suggests that
the blocking site for barium lay most of the way through
the membrane. as kt was much more voltage sensitive than
k_ 1, this could be explained by the blocking barium ion
being shielded from the membrane field by interacting with

potential-dependent and insensitive to internal [ca 2 +] (benham and bolton 1983; bolton et al. 1985). quantitative
study of the action of barium on this channel type was
complicated by the voltage dependence of the channels and
hence the effects were not closely studied. however, the
action of barium ions applied to the inner side of membranes
containing these channels appeared similar qualitatively to
the action described for the larger-conductance ca 2+activated channel.

mechanism of blockade by tetraethylammonium (tea)
charged groups at its binding site so that unbinding was
little affected by potential.
one prediction of the model is that if barium ions physically enter the channel, there should be competition for
occupation of the channel between them and potassium ions
(vergara and latorre 1983) as the channel is thought to
behave as a single file pore. i f [k+] in the pipette, (opposite
side of the membrane to barium) was reduced from 126 mm
to 6 ram, then barium became a more potent blocker. kd
(0 mv) calculated from eq. (4) was 0.9 + 0.4 x 10 -6 m (n =
3) under these conditions, or 1.6 + 0.7 x 10 -6 m calculated
from k_t/kt. these values are again not significantly
(p > 0.1) different and since they are independent estimates
of kd support the model proposed.
the increase in potency of barium was 180-fold if kd
values calculated from eq. (4) were used, or 46-fold if values
calculated from the ratio k_ 1/kl were used (table 1). the
major part of this change occurred in the blocking rate
constant, kl, which increased by 64-fold in 3 experiments
while k_ 1 was about 70% of that in 126:126 m m [k +]. this
suggests that k § ions compete with barium ions for the
blocking site but that there is little "knock-off" of the bound
barium by k § ions. a further prediction of the model is
that while the blocking rate is dependent on [ba2+], the
unblocking rate is not. in two experiments using a
6:126 mm [k +] gradient where three barium concentrations
were applied this was confirmed (table 2): increasing [ba 2+]
from 0.1 to 0.5 m m increased the blocking rate, kl [ba 2 +]
by almost the predicted 5 times but kl, calculated from
eq. (3), was little changed. further increasing [ba 2+] to
5 m m increased the forward rate again but by much less
(3.6 times) than the expected 10-fold increase because k~
declined - probably due to inaccuracy in measuring iobaas
it was 1.9 ms, close to the limit of resolution. however, the
backward rate, k_ ~ was essentially unchanged (table 2).
we were not able to consistently prepare outside-out
isolated patches and so this limited study of the action of
barium applied to the outer surface of the membrane. we
studied channel activity in inside-out patches in which the
pipette solution contained from 1 - 10 m m [ba 2 +]. detailed
analysis was not worthwhile because controls could not be
obtained on the same patch. however, the activity recorded
suggested that barium was much less potent acting from
the outside of the membrane and what blockade there was
showed very little voltage dependence. even  xxxd1891xxx  mm ba 2 §
outside, with the electrical gradient driving ba 2+ into the
channels (patch potential negative) channel activity remained high and littie evidence of channel blocking was
seen. blockade as clear as that shown on internal application
of barium (fig. i b) would have been clearly apparent.
a second type of k+-selective channel was often
observed in membrane patches from these cells that is

tea also reduced current flow through the ca 2 +-activated
k + channels. in contrast to barium, tea appeared to have
a completely different mechanism of action. blockade
appeared as a reduction in unit current amplitude rather
than as a change in channel kinetics. this reduction in unit
current amplitude was progressive during the onset of action
of tea. thus the effect did not represent a sudden transition
to a new conductance state. there was no increase in noise
of the open state current. procaine had a similar effect
(fig. 5 a). the reduction in unit current amplitude was dosedependent for both tea and procaine (fig. 5 b) and the kd
for tea (defined as the concentration of tea producing
a 50% reduction in unit current) was 11.8 + 3.9 x 10 -3 m
(mean ___s.e.m., n = 9). there was considerable variation
in the potency of tea from patch to patch. we found no
explanation for this variation. we were able to exclude the
possibility that this variable potency was due to restricted
access to the patch surface as changing the bathing [k +]
quickly altered unit current amplitude. these results were
obtained with a physiological potassium gradient of
6:126 mm at a patch potential of 0 inv. when the potassium
gradient was equimolar (126:126 mm), tea up to a concentration of 50 m m usually had very little effect on channel
currents. this result suggests that tea may also compete
with potassium. this would be expected if tea acted by
entering the channel to block it. the reduction in unit current
amplitude was not noticeably potential dependent across an
80 mv potential range (fig. 5c). this may mean that the
tea binding site was close to the channel mouth. tea had
no effect on the probability of a channel being in the open
state (fig. 5a, d).
one explanation of the results is that tea blocks and
unblocks the channel with very rapid kinetics that are too
fast to be resolved with the recording system used. the
observed open-state current would then be a mean value
reflecting the proportion of time spent in the open and
blocked states.
consider the situation where tea interacted only with
the open channel according to the scheme:
closed ~ open ~- blocked.
now if the rate constants of the equilibrium open ~blocked were faster than the resolution of the recording
system, then the apparent open state duration that we
observed would be a sum of the open and blocked states. i f
this equilibrium did not affect the rate constants for the
closed ~ open reaction then the apparent open state would
be of longer duration in the presence of tea. in fact, as the
tea concentration was varied, the product of the apparent
/'o and the conductance of the channel should stay constant
(coronado and miller 1982). in the five experiments of

ca 2 +-activated k + channels we applied t e a to patches in
a [k +] gradient of 47:126 mm. u n d e r these conditions ek

on both outward and inward current. t e a reduced unit
currents by the same a m o u n t relative to control whether
current was flowing inwards or outwards across the patch.
thus in this respect the action of t e a differed in these
channels from the action in squid axon k + channels.

procaine had a similar effect on unit currents, causing a
dose dependent reduction that was not potential sensitive.
in experiments in which the action of procaine and tea
could be compared in the same patch, procaine appeared to
be 5 - 1 0 times more potent than tea. tea seemed less
potent when applied to the outer side of the membrane as
when 10 mm tea was added to the pipette solution under
a 126:126 [k § gradient, currents of normal amplitude were
observed in five patches. tea also blocks the  xxxd2988xxx  §
selective channel of mammalian smooth muscle (benham
and bolton 1983).

discussion
we have shown that barium, tea and procaine reduce
current flow through ca 2 +-activated k + channels in visceral
and vascular smooth muscle cells. they also seem to block
the slow potential-sensitive k + channel we have observed
in these cells in at least a qualitatively similar manner (benham and bolton 1983; bolton et al. 1985). these effects
probably explain the depolarization and increased action
potential duration caused by these drugs in whole smooth
muscle tissues (boron 1979). the depolarization may be due
to blockade of k § channels open at the resting membrane
potential. the broadening of the action potential may be
due to blockade of ca2+-activated k + channels, whose
opening normally contributes to the downstroke of the
action-potential (bolton et al. 1985). the capacity of barium
to carry current through voltage-dependent ca 2 § channels
would also contribute to the larger action potentials seen in
the presence of barium (benham et al. 1984b).
barium blockade appeared to be at a site sensing 95%
of the membrane field suggesting a binding site most of the
way through the membrane from the inside. vergara and
latorre (1983) using single channel recording found that
the barium binding site in skeletal muscle t-tubule ca 2 §
activated k + channels was about 80% of the way through
the membrane. their kd (0 mv) was 3 . 6 x l 0 - s m in a
100:100 mm [k +] gradient which is close to our value of
7.3 x 10 - s m value in 126:126 mm (table 1). we were unable to demonstrate any strong effect of barium from the
outer surface of patches and this again is consistent with
vergara and latorre's report of a millimolar kd value for
barium from the trans side. thus the action of barium on
the channels from the two tissues seems to be very similar.
the greater potency at the internal surface suggests that in
the whole smooth muscle cell, barium ions may first enter
the cell through calcium channels before blocking potassium
channels from the inside.
the mechanism of blockade by tea and procaine was
apparently similar to that of hexamethonium on potassium
channels (coronado and miller 1980) and was consistent
with tea blocking at a site at or near the channel mouth
with kinetics that were too rapid to resolve. an approximate
value for the dwell time of tea at the blocking site can
be derived from the ko for tea (benham 1983), where
ko = k-l/k1. the blocking rate constant k~ is ultimately
limited by the rate of diffusion of the drug to its binding site
and a maximum value is thought to be about 108 s -1 m -1
(gutfreund i972). using this value and our value for ko of
12ram, k_l becomes 1.2x106 s -~ and thus the mean
blocked time is 0.8 gs - at least two orders of magnitude
faster than could be resolved with our system. if tea only
blocks the open channel then it would be expected to increase

mean open time (neher and steinbach 1978; coronado and
miller 1982). however, such an increase in mean open time
is dependent upon tea having no effect on the normal
channel opening and closing rate constants. we observed an
increase in mean open time. this non-proportional increase
could be explained if tea binding to the channel modified
the opening and/or closing rates of the channel which would
mean that depending on the opening and closing rates in the
presence of drug either an increased or a decreased mean
open time could be accommodated by the model.
the voltage-dependence of tea block of ca-activated
k channels is different in different cell types (coronado and
miller 1982; vergara et al. 1984; yellen 1984). in sarcoiemmal ca-actived k channels from rabbit intestine tea
block has been briefly reported as voltage-independent
(cecchi et al. 1984). the diverse effects of tea on different
potassium channels are striking (stanfield 1983). the site of
action for tea is presumed to be a wider region near the
mouth of the channel (latorre and miller 1983) and it is
likely that in different potassium channels the geometry of
this mouth is different, resulting in different kd values and
in degree of penetration of tea into the channel. barium
appears to move almost to the potassium selectivity gate
which may be a more highly evolutionarily conserved region
of the molecule.
