abstract
topiramate (top, cas  xxxd3400xxx ) particularly potentiates  xxxd2177xxx 
(gaba) neuroinhibition, and gaba and
glutamate receptors, which have also
been implicated in memory formation.
patients’ giving up treatment due to adverse effects (disorders of attention,
memory, and verbal fluency) is the main
problem with a therapy based on this
drug. the antidepressant effect of top
administered to rats in the dose of
15 mg/kg is observed only after 14 and
21 days of treatment. the delay in the
antidepressant effect of top may be due
to the modulation of gaba a receptors as
well as due to the influence of the drug on
receptors for type ampa/kain excitatory
amino acids. the research has also shown

that long-term treatment with top in a
dose of 15 mg/kg improved spatial memory, as tested in rats with morris test.
probably, this results from the influence
of the drug on gaba a receptors and the
function of glutaminergic receptors
(especially in processes like coding, retrieving, and potentiation of information), adaptive processes in the brain,
notwithstanding, being an important factor.
as top is a normothymic drug, its use
in the treatment of epilepsy may also positively influence cognitive processes in
the so-called interseizure intervals with
memory disorders; the same effects can
be expected in the treatments of bipolar
disorder.

1. introduction
in the recent years, the effectiveness of antiepileptic
drugs, like gabapentin, lamotrigine, and topiramate
(top, cas  xxxd3400xxx ), in the treatment of bipolar disorder has been reported [9, 10]. importantly, these drugs
have been lately classified also as normothymic substances – the so-called “mood stabilisers” – and are today used as mood stabilisers in the treatment of manic
episodes.
many conditions, i. a. epilepsy and mental illnesses,
as well as the treatment of these conditions with certain
drugs, may lead to the impairment of cognitive functions – for example memory [36]; this motivates the
constant search for new drugs that would ensure effective pharmacotherapy and would not cause any deficits,
especially in the function of memory.

several reports have suggested that newer antiepileptic drugs such as gabapentin, or top have fewer effects
on cognition than older drugs [5, 19].
the most significant problem with treatment with
top is that, compared to treatment with other new generation antiepileptic drugs, a large percentage of patients gives up the treatment because of adverse effects
of the drug [42] such as disorders of attention, memory,
and verbal fluency [25].
most authors believe that although antiepileptic drugs
can impair neuropsychological functioning their positive effects on seizure control may improve cognition
and behaviour [21]; this hypothesis has been confirmed
by hoover et al. [15], who proved that top enhances
performance in a water maze in sham-but not brain-injured animals.

taking into consideration that there is much contradictory information about the effect of top on the cognitive functions and very little information about the effect of top on the memory function in animals [15, 21,
36, 37], the purpose of the present study was to assess
the effect of this drug on the spatial memory in rats
using morris test.
moreover, the effect of top in single or repeated administration to rats as an antidepressant has been investigated, as top reduced depressive symptoms in bipolar
depression [22]; the antidepressant activity of this substance still needs to be confirmed in clinical as well as
experimental trials.

2. material and methods
2.1 animals
male wistar rats, 180 – 200 g, bought from a licensed breeder,
cz. sadowski, poznan, poland (licence of the ministry of agriculture in warsaw, poland) were used in the study. the animals
were housed in standard laboratory conditions with a 12 h
light/dark cycle, light on at 6 a. m., in a temperature controlled
room 21 ± 20 'c, humidity 60 % with free access to granulated
standard food and tap water. the rats were kept five per cage
(30 × 30 × 20 cm). each experimental and control group consisted of 10 animals.
all procedures related to the use of animals in these experiments were conducted with all respect to ethical issues regarding experiments on animals. the study protocol was approved
by the local ethical commission for research on animals in
pozna?.

2.2 drugs
carboxymetylcellulose sodium (cmc) pure b.p.c. was from
koch-light laboratories (london, england). top was obtained
from janssen cilag, pharmaceutical factory (warsaw, poland).
top, 15 mg/kg (the doses tested have been shown to be antiepileptic in animals by nowakowska et al. (unpublished observations) and other authors [4, 35]) suspended in cmc was administered per os (p. o.) 30 min before the test. in the chronic
experiments, top was administered once a day for the period
of 3 weeks. each week, after one drug free day to wash out the
remnants of the last dose, the test was performed after administering the usual dose of the drug.
the controls were given only cmc (2 ml/kg p. o.) according
to the same schedule.
separate groups of animals were used for different tests.

2.3 methods
2.3.1 locomotor activity
locomotor activity was measured in the study and in control
groups using eight 20.5 × 28 × 21 cm wire grid cages each with
two horizontal infrared photocell beams along the long axis,
3 cm above the floor. photocell interruptions were recorded by
electromechanical counters in an adjacent room. after 30 min
of habituation to the novel cage rats were treated with top
and then photocell activity was recorded  xxxd1891xxx -min intervals
for 1 h. this test provided an index of basal locomotor activity
of animals in a familiar environment, necessary to indicate the
presence of central stimulant or sedating effects of the drug
used in the novelty test.

2.3.2 forced swimming test – measurement of
immobility (according to porsolt et al. [30])
a) pretest: 24 h before the experiments the rats were placed
individually in plexiglas cylinders (height 40 cm, diameter
18 cm) containing water at 250 'c up to 17 cm height of the cylinder and 15 min later they were removed to  xxxd3426xxx  'c drying
room for 30 min.
b) test: the drugs were administered 24 h after the pretest
and 30 min later the animals were placed once again in the cylinders and immobility was measured for 5 min. a rat was
judged to be immobile when it remained floating in the water,
in an upright position, making only very small movements necessary to keep its head above water. the total duration of immobility during 5 min was recorded by an observer who did not
know which treatment the rats had received.
c) after prolonged administration (7, 14 and 21 days) the
drug action was tested as under b).
the water was changed after the observation of each rat.

2.3.3 morris water maze test (according to morris [24])
the apparatus was a circular basin (diameter = 180 cm,
height = 50 cm) filled with water (approximately 22 – 24 'c) to
the depth of 24 cm, with pieces of styrofoam hiding an escape
platform (diameter = 8 cm) placed 1 cm below the water surface (learning place, invisible condition). many extra-maze visual cues surrounding the maze were available, and the observer remained in the same location for each trial.
the rats were placed in the water close to and facing the
midpoint section of the wall at one of four equally spaced locations: north (n), east (e), south (s) and west (w). the pool was
divided into 4 quadrants: nw, ne, se and sw. the rats were allowed to swim freely until they found the platform on top of
which they could climb. if a rat failed to locate the platform
within 60 s it was placed on the platform where it remained
for 5 s. each rat was submitted to 6 trials per day and at each
trial the starting position was changed (starting on the n side,
followed by e, s, and w sides, in that order). the inter-trial interval was 5 min between trials 1 – 3 and 4 – 6 and 10 min between trails 3 and 4. for the first 3 days of maze testing, the
submerged platform was placed in the nw quadrant and then
in the se quadrant for the following 2 days. after these 5 testing
days, there was a period of 7 days without any testing. on
day 6, the rats were retested with the platform located as on
day 5. on day 7 (one day later), the platform was lifted above
water level and placed in the sw quadrant. on the test day,
each rat was subjected to a single probe trial swim (6 trials).
the total number of times each rat crossed the probe target
area and the time of probe trial swim were recorded by the observer. the time of each of the 6 trials was noted and a mean
value for each rat was calculated. the same procedures were
followed in the chronic experiments.

2.4 statistical analysis
the data are shown as means ± sem. data distribution pattern
was not normal (unlike gauss’s curve). statistical analyses for
memory test and antidepressant test were carried out using
nonparametric anova kruskal-wallis’s test for unpaired data
and anova friedman test for paired data. statistical significance was then tested by the post-hoc dunn test. statistical
analysis for locomotor activity was carried out using the anova
kruskall-wallis test for unpaired data and anova friedman
test for paired data, followed by the mann-whitney u-test.

3. results

after a prolonged treatment for 14 and 21 days, a significant shortening of immobility time was observed
(table 2). this means that during the observation period
of 300 s, the “struggling time” of rats was prolonged by
top.

3.1 locomotor activity
the results of the locomotor activity test are shown in
table 1. the dose of 15 mg/kg of top did not diminish
the motility of rats. the choice of dose the remaining
experiments was based on the assumption that in behavioural tests only doses without influence on motility
should be used [26, 27].
3.2 immobility time
after single and 7-day treatment with the dose of 15 mg/
kg of top, no influence on the passive swimming time
was observed.

4. discussion
reports in literature indicate that the use of new generation antiepileptic drugs, including top, may give good
effects in the treatment of psychiatric disorders such as
bipolar affective disorders, unipolar depression, schizophrenia [11, 18, 41], post-traumatic stress disorder [6, 7],
and eating disorders [3].
moreover, top is noteworthy as a drug that can be
used for stabilising mood [18, 22], and normothymic
drugs, like carbamazepine [28] or lamotrigine have been
proved to have an antidepressant effect [13]. although
top has been proved to have antidepressant activity in
clinical trials [10], there are few works confirming the
antidepressant effect of top in animal experimental
models.
the research has shown that the statistically significant antidepressant effect of top administered to rats
in the dose of 15 mg/kg can be observed only after 14
and 21 days of treatment. traditional antidepressant
drugs are known to show clinical activity only upon repeated administration. this is because the antidepressant effect is a result of adaptive changes taking place
in receptors and an effect of down-regulation [32]. the
delay in the antidepressant effect of top may result
from the modulation of gaba-a receptors, and it may
be also connected to the influence of the drug on the receptors for excitatory amino acids type ampa/kain [31,
40]. the hypothesis assuming the potential antidepressant effect resulting from the increased concentration
of  xxxg1590xxx  also seems probable, as it is known
that top may increase the level of  xxxg1590xxx  in
the hippocampus in rats [16]. it is also known that  xxxg1590xxx  reduces pharmacologically induced seizures
and induces antidepressant-like activity [16].
hargreaves confirmed the antidepressant effect of
top in the modified porsolt forced swim test, the intensity of which is comparable to that of a traditional antidepressant drug – desipramine [14].
cognitive deficits are currently deemed among key
symptoms of mental disorders and epilepsy and may result from old generation drugs treatment. cognitive
function impairment in epileptic patients is often more

490

nowakowska et al. – topiramate

problematic than the fits themselves therefore well
managed, state-of-the-art pharmacotherapy is of particular importance for the functioning of patients. new
drugs that are being used, like gabapentin and lamotrigine, may have fewer effects impairing cognition than
older drugs [19, 23].
authors prove that drugs that directly or indirectly increase gaba-ergic neurotransmission can adversely affect working memory in humans and animals [37]. top
enhances gaba-ergic activity and has been reported to
produce a dose-related impairment in cognitive functions [37]. these impairments affect attention, learning
memory, and verbal fluency [25], and may be temporary, as they usually subside after the interruption of the
treatment [1, 8, 17]. it should be emphasised that the
quoted authors observed an impairment of cognitive
functions after the administration of a single dose of
top.
there is however much contradicting information on
the influence of top on the memory function in animals. the research of martins [21] proved that top administered in the dose of 10 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg
caused deficits in short-term memory in laboratory animals, however where the influence of anxiety on longterm memory was concerned, memory improved after
treatment with small doses of top (0.1 mg/kg), while
higher doses (10 and 100 mg/kg) disrupted this type of
memory [21]. research regarding the effect of top on
working memory in rats carried out by shannon and
love proved that the drug impairs memory in proportion to the doses used [36, 37].
the research has shown that top administered in the
dose of 15 mg/kg (a dose effective anti-epileptically in research on animals) improved spatial memory, which was
tested in rats in morris test, but statistically significant
difference was noted only after prolonged administration. the time the animals needed to get to the platform
was shorter in days 7, 14 and 21 of the test, and the number of passed quadrants was smaller in days 14 and 21 of
the test. similar results were obtained in a research carried out by hoover [15], who observed the improvement
of spatial memory in animals that were subjected to a
long-term treatment with top in the dose of 30 mg/kg.

martins de lima [21] observed the improvement of memory in rats after administering top in a very small dose
(0.01 mg/kg). it is believed that anti-epileptic drugs prove
to be effective by interfering with brain processes that are
also involved in learning and memory function [34].
probably, the mechanism responsible for the improvement in spatial memory in animals is related to
the influence of the drug on gaba-a receptors, and it
is known that gaba and sodium channels have been
implicated in memory formation [21]. the role of glutaminergic receptors in memory processes, especially in
coding, retrieving and potentiation of information has
been suggested. top is known to inhibit excitatory
pathways through the blockade of the ampa and kainate subtypes of glutamate receptors [12].
to summarise, different doses of top can have various effects on memory; moreover, top can induce
either memory impairment or enhancement in different
experimental paradigms [34].
our research confirms the hypothesis of hoover et al.
[15] that to enable memory improvement (as well as to
enable the antidepressant effect), adaptive changes
need to take place in the brain after the administration
of top. as top is a normothymic drug, its use in longterm treatment may positively influence cognitive processes, which seem to be of importance in the treatment
of epilepsy, especially if memory disorders occur at inter-seizure intervals, as well as in the treatment of bipolar disorder.
