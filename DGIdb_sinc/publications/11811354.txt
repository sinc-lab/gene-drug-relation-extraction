summary: nicotine caused a contraction of the rat coronary artery
in the presence of nomega-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-name) and
 xxxd208xxx , and did not in the absence of these agents. the
present experiments were undertaken to pharmacologically characterize the nicotine-induced contraction in ring preparations of the
rat coronary artery. the contraction was abolished by chemical
removal of endothelium saponin. oxygen radical scavengers,
superoxide dismutase and catalase, significantly attenuated the contraction.  xxxg1883xxx  (cox-1) inhibitors ( xxxd2141xxx ,  xxxd2423xxx  and ketrolack) attenuated the nicotine-induced contraction
in a concentration-dependent manner, and  xxxg1884xxx 
(cox-2) inhibitors at high concentrations ( xxxd2727xxx  and
ns-389) slightly attenuated the contraction. a txa2 synthetase

inhibitor (oky-046) attenuated the contraction to a small extent
only at high concentrations. a  xxxg2253xxx  antagonist (s-1452)
attenuated the contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. a
nicotinic receptor antagonist (hexamethonium) attenuated the contraction in part and an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist ( xxxd3000xxx ) nearly
abolished the contraction. from these results, it was suggested that
the contraction induced by nicotine in the rat coronary artery in the
presence of l-name and  xxxd208xxx  is endothelium dependent, and involves reactive oxygen species and endothelial cox-1
metabolites of  xxxd208xxx . part of the contraction is probably
due to release of norepinephrine. key words: rat coronary
artery—nicotine-induced contraction—reactive oxygen species—
endothelium-derived cox-1 metabolites—norepinephrine.

smoking is a risk factor for coronary heart disease,
and nicotine is one of the major active principles of
tobacco smoke. nicotine causes oxidative stress to the
pancreatic tissue of rats and the esophageal mucosa (1,2).
excessive free-radical generation is thought to contribute
to tissue injury in a broad spectrum of diseases. in most
peripheral arteries from various species, endotheliumdependent relaxation has been predominantly observed
and considered to be more important than endotheliumdependent contraction (edc). in the canine basilar
artery, various vasoactive substances including nicotine,
acetylcholine (ach),  xxxd83xxx  (atp) and
 xxxg99xxx  cause edc, and the endothelium-derived
contracting factor (edcf) is a cyclooxygenase (cox)
metabolite of  xxxd208xxx , thromboxane a2 (txa2)

(3–7). in rabbit intrapulmonary artery,  xxxg2240xxx 
induces edc and its edcf is txa2 (8). also, in the
rabbit coronary artery, the edcf for ach-induced edc
in the presence of a  xxxd2738xxx  (no) synthetase inhibitor
[nomega-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-name)] is a
 xxxg147xxx  metabolite of  xxxd208xxx ,
leukotriene c4,d4 (9). thus, we have suggested that edc
plays an important role in the regulation of vascular tone
and in the pathophysiology of cerebral circulatory disturbance (10). we recently observed that nicotine caused a
contraction in the rat coronary artery in the presence of
l-name and  xxxd208xxx . there have been few
reports on nicotine-induced contraction in the rat coronary artery. the present experiments were undertaken to
pharmacologically characterize nicotine-induced con-

traction in the rat coronary artery in the presence of
l-name and  xxxd208xxx .
methods
experimental animals and preparation
male wistar rats (10 weeks old) were supplied by
shimizu laboratory supplies co. ltd. (kyoto, japan).
the animals were housed in steel cages at ambient temperature with a 12-h light/dark cycle and a humidity of
about 60%, and were allowed free access to food and
water. left anterior descending coronary arteries were
isolated from rats after anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and exsanguination
from the abdominal aorta. the left anterior descending
coronary arteries were removed and cleaned of excess fat
and connective tissue. then, arterial rings (1.5–2 mm in
length, about 0.2 mm in diameter) from the vessels were
prepared. each ring was inserted between two hooks
(diameter, 100 µm). one hook was attached to a holder
and the other was connected to a polygraph (san-ei
instruments, co. ltd., tokyo, japan) via a strain gauge
force-displacement transducer (san-ei instruments, co.
ltd.), on which isometric tension was recorded. each
ring of the artery was then placed in a 5-ml tissue organ
bath (ufer medical instrument, co. ltd., kyoto, japan)
containing a physiological salt solution of the following
composition: nacl, 120 mm; kcl, 4.7 mm;  xxxd2534xxx 
1.2 mm; kh2po4, 1.2 mm; cac12, 2.5 mm; nahco3,
25 mm; and glucose, 10 mm. the bathing solution was
maintained at 37 ± 0.5°c and was bubbled with 95% o2
and 5% co2 (ph 7.4) throughout the experiments. an
initial 0.3 g tension was applied to each preparation and
an equilibration period of 60 min was allowed before
commencing the experiments. the resting tension was
readjusted periodically until equilibration was achieved.
confirming kci (80 mm)-induced contractions, studies
were carried out by two separate protocols as follows. 1.
nicotine was non-cumulatively added to the organ bath
in the presence of l-name (10–4 m) and arachidonic
acid (10–6 m). l-name was added to the organ bath
10 min before the addition of  xxxd208xxx . twenty
minutes after addition of  xxxd208xxx , nicotine was
added to the organ bath. 2. to examine the effects of various agents on the nicotine-induced contractions, these
agents were added to the organ bath 10 min before the
addition of nicotine. nicotine-induced contractions in the
presence of l-name and  xxxd208xxx , before treatment with each agent, were taken as 100%, and the effect
of each agent was expressed as the percentage of contraction relative to the control.

results
response to nicotine in the rat coronary artery
nicotine at 3 × 10–4 to 5 × 10–3 m did not cause a contraction. l-name (10–4 m) (no synthetase inhibitor)
alone or  xxxd208xxx  (10–6 m) alone showed a slight
but definite contraction. in the presence of both agents,
nicotine caused a concentration-dependent contraction at
3 × 10–4 to 3 × 10–3 m. the maximal contraction at nicotine (3 × 10–3 m) in the presence of both agents was
0.182 ± 39 g (n = 5). the contraction was nearly abolished by pretreatment with saponin (0.05 mg/ml for
50 min), which is known as a chemical removal of the
endothelium (11) (fig. 1). hexamethonium  xxxd1891xxx –3 m and
 xxxd3000xxx   xxxd1891xxx –6 m attenuated the contraction with
decreases of 51 ± 9% (n = 6) and 89 ± 10% (n = 5),
respectively.
effects of sod and catalase on nicotine-induced
contraction in the rat coronary artery
to determine whether nicotine (3 × 10–3 m)-induced
contraction in the presence of both agents, l-name
(10–4 m) and  xxxd208xxx  (10–6 m), was due to reactive oxygen species, effects of radical scavengers, sod
and catalase (12,13) were examined. as shown in fig. 2,
the addition of sod (150 u/ml) or catalase (1000 u/ml)
attenuated the nicotine-induced contraction with
decreases of about 55% (n = 4) and 48% (n = 4) at mean
values, respectively. sod (150 u/ml) treatment combined with catalase (1000 u/ml) attenuated the contraction with a decrease of 91 ± 10% (n = 8) (fig. 2).

effects of a txa2 synthetase inhibitor and a txa2

coronary artery
oky-046 at 3 × 10–5 m, a txa2 synthetase inhibitor
(19), attenuated nicotine-induced contraction in the
canine basilar artery (7). the same concentration of
oky-046 slightly attenuated that of the rat coronary
artery (fig. 4). in contrast, a txa2 antagonist (20),
s-1452 at 3 × 10–9 to 3 × 10–7 m, attenuated the contraction in a concentration-dependent manner (fig. 4).
discussion

effects of pla2 and cox inhibitors on nicotineinduced contraction in the rat coronary artery
we have reported that, in the canine basilar artery,
nicotine causes an endothelium-dependent contraction
and its contracting factor for the contraction is arachidnic
acid metabolite, txa2 (7). to elucidate the involvement
of  xxxd208xxx  metabolites in nicotine-induced contraction, effects of pla2 and cox inhibitors on the contraction were examined. a pla2 inhibitor, manoalide
(10–5 m) (14), slightly attenuated the contraction. the
nicotine-induced contraction was attenuated concentration dependently by selective cox-1 inhibitors (15,16),
 xxxd2141xxx  (3 × 10–9 to 10–7 m), ketorolac (10–8 to
3 × 10–7 m) and  xxxd2423xxx  (3 × 10–8 to 10–6 m) (fig. 3).
the potency order of the inhibitory effects of these

in the rat coronary artery (ring preparations), nicotine
caused a contraction in the presence of l-name (no
synthetase inhibitor) and  xxxd208xxx . the contraction was almost abolished by saponin, which is known as
a chemical removal of the endothelium (10). these
results indicate that nicotine causes an edc under the
inhibition of no synthesis, and uses exogenous  xxxd208xxx  in rat coronary artery. it was assumed that, in
the rat coronary artery, the endothelium-relaxing system
was the more important mechanism regulating vascular
basal tone than the endothelium-dependent contracting
system. in other words, when the no-relaxing system is
impaired by an inhibitor, the contracting system using
exogenous  xxxd208xxx  may appear predominantly.
the contraction was attenuated in part by a nicotinic

receptor antagonist and almost abolished by alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, suggesting that adrenergic norepinephrine may be involved in the contraction at least partly. in
the following sections, the pharmacological profiles of
nicotine-induced edc in the rat coronary artery are discussed.
nicotine causes oxidative stress in rat pancreatic tissue
and esophageal mucosa of rats (1,2). it has been shown
that calcium ionophore a23187-induced edc in the
canine basilar artery is due to the superoxide anion (21).
to determine whether the nicotine-induced edc in the
rat coronary artery is due to reactive oxygen species,
effects of radical scavengers, sod and catalase (12,13),
were examined. sod alone and catalase alone reduced
the edc to a certain extent, and sod combined with
catalyse treatment markedly attenuated the edc. these
results clearly indicate that nicotine-induced edc is due
to reactive oxygen species. we have reported that, in
canine basilar artery, edcs in response to various stimulants including ach, atp,  xxxg2240xxx  and nicotine are
mediated by the cox metabolites of  xxxd208xxx ,
txa2 (3–8). also in this series of studies, cox
inhibitors and txa2 agents related to edc were tested.
in the present study, selective cox-1 inhibitors,  xxxd2141xxx ,  xxxd2423xxx  and ketorolac (15,16), inhibited the
edc and selective cox-2 inhibitors,  xxxd2727xxx  and
ns-398 (17,18), slightly attenuated the edc. these
results suggest that edc is mainly due to cox-1
metabolites of  xxxd208xxx . in addition, a txa2 synthetase inhibitor and txa2 antagonist clearly inhibited
edc in the canine basilar artery produced by nicotine
(7). in contrast, a txa2 inhibitor (oky-046) did not
clearly inhibit nicotine-induced edc in the rat coronary
artery, while a txa2 antagonist (s-1452) clearly attenuated edc. from these results, it is assumed that possible
contracting factors involved in the edc may be cox-1
metabolites, which stimulate txa2 receptors. reactive
oxygen species non-enzymatically produce isopropstane,
including 8-epi pgf2alpha, from the membrane phospholipids in humans, and enzymatically produce it in the rat
(22,23). in the rat, the production of isoprostane mediates
cox (23). 8-epi pgf2alpha produces an increase in mean
pulmonary arterial pressure, which is mediated by txa2
receptors (24). as already mentioned, the present experiments clearly demonstrate the involvement of reactive
oxygen species, cox-1 metabolites and  xxxg2253xxx 
activation in nicotine-induced edc in the rat coronary
artery. edc is probably partly due to adrenergic norepinphrine.
although smoking is well documented as a risk factor
of coronary heart disease, the pathophysiological significance of nicotine-induced edc in coronary circulation
has not been fully documented. in atherosclerosis, the
production of cox-dependent endothelium-derived contracting factors and endothelin is enhanced. edcfs can
profoundly affect vascular tone and counteract relaxing
factors produced within the endothelium (25). in platelet
aggregation areas and inflammatory regions, the local
concentration of  xxxd208xxx  may increase. if this is
j cardiovasc pharmacol™, vol. 38 (suppl. 1), 2001

the case, nicotine may generate reactive oxygen species
and the subsequently generated cox-1 metabolites may
cause coronary artery contraction. this is one explanation of the risk factor of smoking, and may be a cause of
coronary circulation disturbance.
