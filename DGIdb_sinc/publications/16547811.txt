introduction

results and discussion

mammalian  xxxg1040xxx  (dchs) is a group
ii pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (plp)-dependent l- amino acid
decarboxylase (l-aadcii) [1] that has roles in inflammatory and neurological diseases, and in progression of several
cancer types [2]. at present, all inhibitors developed against
the mammalian enzyme are also active against the homologous dchs of enterobacteria, so reducing the possibility of
avoiding several secondary effects when orally administered.
we have recently obtained and validated a model for active
mammalian dchs [3, 4]. here, models of the enterobacterial
enzyme are built, taking klebsiella planticola dchs [5] as
the prototype. biocomputational analysis of the evolutionary
specificity-determinants of the mammalian dchs, including
the subgroup of l-aadciis was also carried out.

an evolutionary tree containing 58 sequences of the l-aadcii family is shown in figure 1. as expected, mammalian
ddcs and dchss belong to the same subgroup (a), since
both enzymes are highly homologous homodimers with
similar quaternary structure that are able to use histidine as
the substrate [2, 3]. from these results, we decided to look
for specificity determinants of subgroup a with respect to
the subgroup that includes enterobacterial dchss (b). the

materials and methods
the seed-alignment of pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylase provided by pfam was initially used (www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/pfam/
getacc?pf00282) to get a fs-profile by hmmer (hmmer.wustl.edu)
and to find more homologous sequences and structures in swissprot
and protein data banks; 58 different sequences were finally aligned by
clustalw (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustal) and manually purged to avoid fragments and orphan proteins. then, sdppred server and rate4site program (math.genebee.msu.ru/~psn/algo.htm & www.tau.ac.il/~itaymay/
cp/rate4site.html) were applied to look for specificity determinants of
subgroup a of l-aadciis. different templates (pig  xxxg618xxx 
– ddc –, and e. coli  xxxg913xxx  – dce –) and programs
(modeller and swissmodel: salilab.org/modeller/modeller.html &
swissmodel.expasy.org//swiss-model.html) were used to obtain the
k. planticola dchs models. for comparison purposes a previous rat
dchs model reported by authors was used [2].

fig. 2. three-dimensional models of both a) mammalian and b) enterobacterial prototypes of dchs monomers. secondary structures are shown
inside the predicted protein surfaces. the rat dchs dimerization surface [2] is shown in green. for orientation, amino- and carboxyl-termini k and h
residues (plp-interacting residues) and several conserved residues are located in both structures and depicted in equivalent positions with respect to
the plp-binding domain.

20 specificity determinants with the highest scores were (in
decreasing order): y279,  xxxd315xxx , p85, m97, s77, l132, r361,
y83,  xxxd348xxx , s112, q150, g40, l377, r415, a82, w75, p70,
r286, l285, i430. most of them (55 %) are within the first
160 residues (first third of the primary structure). this fact
suggests that the major differences between subgroup a
structures and those of subgroup b are located on the n-terminal alpha-helixes, which are known to support the highest
degree of intertwining between both subgroup a monomers
[2, 3].
there is no x-ray solved structure for any dchs yet
available so to compare the structures of both subgroups,
three models of the k. planticola dchs monomer were built
using either e. coli dce or pig ddc as templates. figure 2b
shows the model obtained with modeller and pig ddc. this
template obtained the best score from hmmer when the
pfam seed-alignment was used. with respect to the  xxxg2296xxx , the three enterobacterial models gave similar
results; it is predicted to have a rather different conformation to its counterpart in rat dchs (fragment 1–160, mostly
located at the upper-left part of the mammalian structure
shown in fig. 2a).
dimeric and tetrameric active forms of bacterial plp-dependent dchss have been reported [5]; however, aggregates
with relative molecular mass higher than the mammalian
dimer are not active [6]. all of these results and predictions
suggest that both enzymes must differ in their quaternary
organization, so that the dimerization surface could be a
promising target to design new intervention strategies able to

discriminate between mammalian and enterobacterial hdc
activities.
