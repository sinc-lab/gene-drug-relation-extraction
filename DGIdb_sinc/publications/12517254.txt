6. expert opinion

numerous small molecule synthetic  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors are in clinical
development for the treatment of human cancers. these fall into three broad
categories: inhibitors of the  xxxg682xxx   xxxg2198xxx 
family (e.g., iressa™ and tarceva™), inhibitors of the split kinase domain
receptor  xxxg2198xxx  subgroup (e.g.,  xxxd3496xxx / xxxd3496xxx  and  xxxd3264xxx ) and
inhibitors of tyrosine kinases from multiple subgroups (e.g., gleevec™). in
addition, agents targeting other tyrosine kinases implicated in cancer, such as
met,  xxxg2259xxx  and src, are in preclinical development. as experience is gained in
the clinic, it has become clear that unleashing the full therapeutic potential
of  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors will require patient preselection, better assays to
guide dose selection, knowledge of mechanism-based side effects and ways
to predict and overcome drug resistance.

introduction

cancer is fundamentally a disease of aberrant signalling. in particular, deregulated signalling via tyrosine kinases plays a major role in the growth and spread of cancers [1,2].
this is graphically illustrated by the example in figure 1, where a non-small cell lung
tumour can be readily distinguished from surrounding tissue via its elevated immunostaining with an antibody recognising  xxxd1075xxx  moieties. four of the six
‘hallmarks of the transformed state’ (self sufficiency in growth signals, evasion of
apoptosis, sustained angiogenesis and tissue invasion and metastasis [2]) are heavily
dependent on  xxxg2198xxx  signalling. consequently, tyrosine kinases are the most
common, and thus far the most successful, targets in rational oncology drug discovery.
the most commonly targeted tyrosine kinases are the receptor tyrosine kinases
(rtks), which are transmembrane proteins containing extracellular ligand-binding
domains and intracellular catalytic domains [3]. much of the specificity in signal
transduction stems from the specific interaction of rtks with their cognate ligands,
with both receptors and ligands having defined patterns of expression [4]. in contrast, the major pathways/effectors signalling downstream of rtks (i.e., the ras
pathway, phospholipase cgamma, src family kinases, signal transducers and activators of
transcription [stats]) are often shared by multiple rtks and also cross-communicate with non-rtk-dependent signalling pathways, such as those initiated by
g-protein-coupled hormone receptors [4]. hence, targeting rtks is a logical strategy to achieve maximum selectivity with minimum collateral damage to normal tissue. however, it is noteworthy that the consequences of inhibiting ubiquitously
utilised major downstream pathways need not be grave, at least in adults. for example, selective raf ( xxxd3226xxx , bayer) and mek ( xxxd1688xxx , pfizer) kinase inhibitors are relatively well-tolerated by patients at exposures which have been

targets of  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors
currently in clinical development
2.

the targets of  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors currently in clinical
development are listed in table 1. at a glance it can be seen
that these targets are almost exclusively rtks, with the exception of bcr-abl. the rtks targeted are all from the epidermal
growth factor receptor (egfr) family (i.e., her2) or from
the split kinase domain rtk subgroup of tyrosine kinases
(the  xxxg2413xxx  [vegf] receptors, the
platelet-derived growth factor [pdgf] receptors, kit, fmslike  xxxg2198xxx  3 [ xxxg801xxx ] and fibroblast growth factor
receptor 1 [ xxxg791xxx ]). these rtk targets are highly
expressed and/or activated primarily/exclusively on cancer
cells (egfr, her2, wild-type and mutant activated  xxxg801xxx ),
on both cancer cells and cancer-associated ancillary cells, such
as endothelial cells, fibroblasts, pericytes and mast cells
( xxxg791xxx , the pdgf receptors, kit), or primarily on
endothelial cells (the vegf receptors) [7]. for all of these
rtks, with the exception of the vegf receptors, genetic
lesions have been detected in at least a limited number of
patients with various cancers (table 1).
activating mutations of these  xxxg2198xxx  targets have
been detected in solid tumours, such as egfr in gliomas
and kit in gastrointestinal stromal tumours (gist) [8,9]. in
addition, deregulated production of pdgf-b via a chromosomal translocation fusing the collagen ialpha 1 gene to the
locus encoding pdgf-b has been implicated in the rare
sarcoma dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans [10]. however,
52

activating mutations have been particularly evident in haematopoietic malignancies. for example, in the majority of
chronic myelogenous leukaemia (cml) patients, a chromosomal translocation leads to production of the bcr-abl
fusion protein, resulting in catastrophic deregulation of the
kinase domain of the abl  xxxg2198xxx  [11]. similarly, in
acute myelogenous leukaemia (aml), an internal tandem
duplication in the juxtamembrane region of  xxxg801xxx  in 20% of
patients results in deregulation of kinase activity and associated poor prognosis [12]. in addition, activating substitutions at residue  xxxd835xxx  in the  xxxg801xxx  catalytic domain have
been detected in blasts in 5% of aml patients [12]. also in
aml, activating mutations in kit have been detected in
blasts from 5% of patients [13].  xxxg1710xxx  is constitutively
activated by enforced dimerisation mediated via fusion with
the tel transcription factor (tel- xxxg1710xxx ) in chronic
myelogenous monocytic leukaemia (cmml) patients [14].
similarly, in several haematological malignancies  xxxg791xxx  is
activated by fusion with  xxxg256xxx  (bcr)
(rare cml patients) or with fused oncogene partner (fop),
znf198, fim or cep110 (8p12 stem cell myeloproliferative disorder) [14-20].
using preclinical models, it has been demonstrated that
bcr-abl alone is sufficient to sustain the pathobiology of
cml [11]. this does not appear to be the case for activated
rtks. for example, aml stems from the combined consequences of proliferative and survival stimuli generated by
mutated or otherwise activated  xxxg801xxx  and impaired differentiation stemming from the production of dominant negative
fusion proteins such as  xxxg1996xxx /eto [12]. likewise, transduction of tel- xxxg1710xxx  into mice results in a myeloproliferative syndrome, but not acute leukaemia [21], indicating that
additional signalling lesions are required for the manifestation
of full-blown disease.
3. tyrosine

kinase inhibitors in clinical
development
a large number of  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors are currently in
clinical development for the treatment of cancer. their chemical structures (where published/presented) are shown in
figure 2. all bind in the vicinity of the atp-binding site of
their target kinases, using a portion of their scaffold to mimic
the binding of the adenine moiety of atp. binding is reversible in all cases, with the exception of  xxxd421xxx  (pfizer) and
 xxxd2866xxx  (wyeth), which bind irreversibly to egfr and
her2 [22]. in addition to small molecule adenine mimetics,
some other therapeutic approaches to inhibiting tyrosine
kinase-dependent signalling pathways exhibit promise in the
clinic, including therapeutic antibodies and antisense/
ribozyme molecules [3]. however, these are beyond the scope
of this review, except when their clinical activities shed light
on the clinical activities of small molecule kinase inhibitors.

has benefited from employing direct (e.g., inhibition of target
receptor autophosphorylation) and indirect (e.g., tumour
imaging via positron emission tomography (pet) scanning
and dynamic contrast magnetic resonance imaging [mri])
measures of target modulation, in concert with antitumour
efficacy. based on their kinase targets, these compounds can
be broadly divided into three classes: inhibitors of egfr
family kinases; inhibitors of split kinase domain rtks; and
inhibitors of tyrosine kinases from more than one subgroup.
3.1 inhibitors

of  xxxg682xxx 
family kinases
several small molecule inhibitors are highly advanced in clinical development, notably  xxxd2186xxx  (iressa™; astrazeneca),
which is now registered in japan for non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) and osi-774 (tarceva™;genentech/roche/
osi pharmaceuticals). these agents have shown encouraging
signs of activity against multiple tumour types associated
with elevated egfr activity, such as nsclc, colorectal cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc) and
ovarian cancer. notably, in large double-blind phase ii trials

in advanced nsclc,  xxxd2186xxx , administered as a single
agent, exhibited clinically significant antitumour activity
[23,24]. in addition to the small molecule inhibitors listed in
table 2, two very promising egfr-blocking antibodies  xxxd467xxx 
(imclone) and  xxxd2838xxx  (abgenix) are also in advanced
clinical development [25].
 xxxd2186xxx  and osi-774 are selective for egfr over her2,
whereas some other egfr inhibitors are not (e.g.  xxxd421xxx ).
her2 is a validated target in its own right based on the clinical experience with anti-her2 (trastuzumab, herceptin®;
genentech) in breast cancer. some preclinical studies have
suggested that inhibiting both egfr and her2 confers efficacy against a broader array of tumours than inhibition of
egfr alone [26]. however, this is controversial – recent data
with  xxxd2186xxx  suggest that, by exploiting cross-talk between
egfr and her2, it is a highly efficient inhibitor of her2dependent cellular signalling [27] in functional terms, if not at
the biochemical level. as multiple egfr/her2 dual inhibitors progress though clinical development, it will become
apparent whether this profile presents significant clinical benefit/toxicological liabilities over inhibition of egfr alone.

based on the clinical experience to date, treatment with egfr
kinase inhibitors (or egfr-blocking antibodies) as single agents
results in primarily cytostatic (halting or delaying tumour
growth) as opposed to cytoreductive (tumour regressing), effects
on tumours in patients. this was predicted based on the performance of egfr-inhibiting agents in preclinical models.
hence, achieving optimal clinical benefit for egfr (and presumably egfr/her2) inhibitors will probably require combination with conventional cytotoxic therapies. in this regard, the
recent announcement that  xxxd2186xxx  combined with standard
platinum-based therapy to treat nsclc confers no additional
benefit over the standard therapy alone was both disappointing
and surprising in light of its favourable single agent activity in this
indication [23,24,28]. this result highlights the difficulties inherent
in transitioning from observing evidence of single agent phase ii
responses to achieving clinical benefit (i.e., improved survival) in
phase iii settings where an agent is given as front-line therapy
and/or in combination with standards of care.
3.2 inhibitors

of split kinase domain receptor tyrosine
kinases
in general, split kinase domain rtk inhibitors are at an earlier stage of clinical development than egfr inhibitors. the

most advanced agent is  xxxd3496xxx / xxxd3496xxx  (novartis), a
selective inhibitor of the vegf rtks, which also has some
(less potent) activity against both kit and  xxxg1710xxx  [29-31].
this agent has been in the clinic for several years and has
exhibited encouraging signs of biological activity (stable disease) in cancer patients. in addition, elevated plasma vegf
levels (consistent with an antiangiogenic effect inducing
tumour hypoxia) and changes in various tumour functional
imaging readouts have been seen following treatment with
 xxxd3496xxx / xxxd3496xxx  in some patients in phase i studies
[31,32]. however, the overall clinical activity seen with
 xxxd3496xxx / xxxd3496xxx  to date has been somewhat modest.
possible explanations for this could include failure to reach
exposure in patients sufficient to durably inhibit vegf
receptors and the limited therapeutic potential inherent in
primarily inhibiting vegf signalling alone. consistent with
the latter, a vegf-neutralising antibody (bevacizumab,
avastin™; genentech) has generally exhibited cytostatic,
rather than cytoreductive, properties in its promising early
clinical development [33,34].
recently, several new inhibitors of split kinase domain
rtks entered clinical trials, including  xxxd3264xxx  (sugen/
pharmacia), cp 549,632 (pfizer) and  xxxd252xxx  (pfizer).

small molecule  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors: clinical development of anticancer agents

the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship coupling inhibition of its rtk targets with consequent antitumour efficacy has been elucidated for  xxxd3264xxx  in mice
and is being used to guide its clinical development [35,36].
similar studies have also been presented for cp 549,632 and
 xxxd252xxx  [37-39]. all three agents exhibited strong efficacy
in preclinical tumour models. interestingly, tumour regression was seen for  xxxd3264xxx  in multiple preclinical models,
but has not been reported for either cp 549,632 or
 xxxd252xxx . the basis for this difference in preclinical
tumour response is unclear, but might reflect subtle differences in target profiles, pharmacology or chemistry. for
example, all three compounds inhibited  xxxg1274xxx , but only
 xxxd3264xxx  has been reported to inhibit kit [36,40]. in addition, while  xxxd3264xxx  was equipotent versus  xxxg1274xxx  and
 xxxg1710xxx  in mice,  xxxd252xxx  was less potent versus
 xxxg1710xxx  than against  xxxg1274xxx  in mice, and cp 549,632
was not active in vitro versus  xxxg1710xxx  at relevant concentrations [35-39]. hence, more potent activity against
 xxxg1710xxx  may constitute the critical difference distinguishing  xxxd3264xxx  from the other agents.
importantly, selective pharmacological inhibition of pdgf
signalling using a pdgf-binding molecule, gfb-111 (h. lee
moffit cancer center), which does not inhibit signalling via
other growth factors evaluated (including vegf, egf, acidic
fgf and basic fgf), results in potent inhibition of tumour
growth and angiogenesis in mice [41]. the vegfrs mediate
endothelial cell invasion, proliferation and survival [42].
 xxxg1710xxx , aside from its role in autocrine cancer cell growth,
is a critical mediator of survival of smooth muscle cells supporting tumour vasculature and is also expressed on fibroblasts in the tumour stromal compartment which supply
growth factors to endothelial and cancer cells [7,43,44]. hence,
simultaneous inhibition of both targets would be anticipated
to result in efficacy enhanced over that achieved by inhibition
of either target alone. consistent with this hypothesis,
su6668 (sugen/pharmacia), a small molecule inhibitor of
the vegf and pdgf receptors, exhibits profound antiangiogenic effects and the ability to regress diverse tumours in
mice at doses which durably inhibit (≥ 12 of 24 h with oncedaily dosing)  xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg1710xxx  [45].
3.3 inhibitors

of tyrosine kinases from more than one
subgroup
imatinib (gleevec™; novartis) is a compound of this type
which inhibits bcr-abl and members of the split kinase
domain rtk subgroup. the stunning efficacy of this agent in
patients with cml (driven by bcr-abl) and gist (driven by
mutated kit) has been extensively detailed elsewhere and has
led to the approval of this agent for the treatment of these
cancers [9,11,46,47]. in addition, imatinib has recently been
shown to be highly efficacious in treating four patients with
chronic myeloproliferative diseases stemming from activated
 xxxg1710xxx  protein fusion products [48]. normalisation of
blood cell counts and complete cytogenetic responses were
56

achieved in all of the patients, coupled with resolution of an
unusual disfiguring skin disease in one instance [48]. evidence
of efficacy has also been seen in two of three patients (including a complete histological response in one patient) with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans [49,50]. the presence of
pdgf-b translocations was not rigorously confirmed in these
patients, but this effect is presumably mediated via inhibition
of  xxxg1710xxx  by imatinib.
since imatinib is reported to inhibit wild-type kit and
 xxxg1710xxx , it might also be expected to exhibit activity in
indications where kit and/or pdgf receptor autocrine signalling have been implicated, such as small cell lung cancer
(sclc) and glioblastoma. however, preliminary results with
imatinib have been disappointing in these indications [51]. in
the case of sclc, this may reflect any or all of the following:
inadequate trial design (patients not preselected on basis of
kit expression), weaker activity against wild-type (sclc) as
opposed to mutant (gist) kit and fundamental uncertainty as to the contribution of wild-type kit to sclc
pathobiology. in the case of glioblastoma, there is uncertainty
as to the ability of imatinib to reach target plasma concentrations in the brain. more fundamentally, unlike several of the
other agents described in this review, which inhibit both
pdgf and vegf receptors, imatinib does not inhibit
vegfr, which may limit its utility in treating diverse
tumours for reasons outlined in section 3.2. however,
regardless of its ultimate performance in indications other
than cml, gist and myeloproliferative diseases, imatinib
has provided a clear roadmap for rational development of
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors in oncology.
one manifestation of this is the heavy reliance on haematological malignancies, in particular aml, in the clinical
development of multiple additional agents, including  xxxd3287xxx ,  xxxd2458xxx  and pkc-412 (millenium, cephalon and
novartis, respectively; table 2). in the case of  xxxd2458xxx  and
pkc-412, patients are being preselected for phase i trials on
the basis of  xxxg801xxx  mutational status. however, as outlined
earlier, aml pathobiology is not solely dependent on  xxxg801xxx .
hence, while significant biological activity might be anticipated for agents which inhibit  xxxg801xxx  in patients, it may be
unreasonable to expect to see biological activity for these
agents in aml comparable to that seen for imatinib in
cml [12].
4. additional tyrosine

kinase cancer targets in
preclinical development
in addition to the agents discussed above, numerous other
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors are in preclinical development. in
some cases these are second generation descendents of agents
described previously. the goal in most of these cases is to find
utility in previously validated tumour indications using more
optimised chemistries and pharmacology. in other cases,
agents are being developed to target kinases which have not
yet been pharmacologically challenged in humans. these

expert opin. investig. drugs (2003) 12(1)

laird & cherrington

include inhibitors of the met and  xxxg2259xxx  rtks and inhibitors
of members of the src family of tyrosine kinases.
4.1 met,

 xxxg2259xxx  and src kinases
met is commonly overexpressed in tumours and point mutations have been identified in hereditary and sporadic papillary
renal carcinomas, gastric, hepatocellular and head and neck
carcinomas [52,53]. preclinical research and clinical correlative
studies have implicated met in tumour growth and dissemination [52,53]. its importance in adult homeostasis is unknown,
so elucidation of potential mechanism-based toxicities will
await generation of conditional knockout mice or the development of met-selective inhibitors/antagonists suitable for
in vivo use.
 xxxg2259xxx  is a mediator of signalling via the angiopoietins ang1
(which stabilises pre-existing vessels) and  xxxg161xxx  (which destabilises vessels, allowing tumour neoangiogenesis) [54]. abbott
has recently presented data on a selective inhibitor capable of
inhibiting  xxxg2259xxx  in mice [55-57]. given the potentially critical
role of  xxxg2259xxx -ang1 signalling in maintaining the integrity of
adult vasculature [58], the safety profile of this and similar
agents following repeated dosing in preclinical species will be
of high interest.
the src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases are among
the best characterised of all signalling molecules. the widely
expressed (and closely related) src and yes kinases are particularly attractive targets for therapeutic intervention in cancer,
having being implicated in the growth and dissemination of
breast and colon cancer [59-62]. efforts to develop src inhibitors for clinical development have thus far been stymied by
onerous selectivity constraints, in particular the need to avoid
targeting the src family kinase lck, a critical mediator of tcell development and function [63]. modest advances have
been achieved by sugen/pharmacia and novartis in developing atp-mimetics with approximately tenfold selectivity
for src over lck [64,65]. however, in this arena, other therapeutic strategies, such as the exploitation of a structural difference
between the src and lck sh2 domains using  xxxd1075xxx 
mimetics which inhibit protein-to-protein interactions, may
ultimately prove more fruitful [66,67].
4.2 kinase target selection for drug development

it is notable that, with the exception of the vegfrs
(expressed predominantly on endothelial cells), her2 and
 xxxg1709xxx  (where gene amplification has been seen in some
cancers for both kinases), all targets of  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors currently in the clinic for oncology have been shown to
be mutated in at least one type of human cancer ( table 1). in
addition, mutations of met and src have also been detected
in human tumours [53,68]. the near-requirement for mutations in selecting kinase targets for oncology drug development stems from a combination of two factors:
• detection of activating mutations in archival human
tumours provides strong support for target selection and

subsequent investment in drug development (the converse
also holds)
• the presence of mutations in particular indications, or in
subsets of patients within indications, provides a strategy
for rational clinical development
detection of amplification of genes in cancer, in the absence
of activating mutations, is also supportive for target validation, but is conceptually and practically less compelling. in an
obvious illustration of this, several amplicons detected in cancer patients each encode multiple proteins implicated in cancer (e.g.  xxxg411xxx  and mdm2 in gliosarcoma [69], her2 and
c-myc in breast cancer [70] and prostate stem cell antigen and
c-myc in prostate cancer [71]). this coamplification can complicate elucidation of the significance (if any) of amplification
of a particular locus, although high resolution mapping of
amplicons to reveal centres of amplification can partially overcome this obstacle [69].
5.

emerging issues in the clinic

the early clinical oncology experience with  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitors (and targeted therapies in general) has been mixed.
however, several salient issues have emerged, namely patient
preselection, dose selection, mechanism-based side effects and
the potential for the emergence of resistance. how these issues
are addressed will have a major impact on the successful clinical development of  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors.
5.1 patient preselection

the experience with imatinib in cml, gist and myeloproliferative disorders graphically demonstrates the therapeutic
potential of selective  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors in treating
malignancies driven largely or entirely by a single activated
 xxxg2198xxx . based on this experience, patients are being
preselected on the basis of their  xxxg801xxx  mutational status for
several ongoing phase i trials in aml (involving  xxxd2458xxx 
and pkc-412). this strategy is also analogous to the clinical
development of trastuzumab, where patients were preselected
for trials in advanced breast cancer on the basis of her2
expression status [72].
however, mutated (or amplified) kinases have not been
identified in most solid tumours. this may partially reflect our
paucity of knowledge of mutational status of most kinases in
most cancers. for example, an ambitious cancer genome
screening effort has just revealed that the majority of melanomas exhibit hitherto unsuspected mutations in b-raf [73]. on
the other hand, the majority of solid tumours exhibit multiple
aberrant signalling pathways and may not express and/or be
driven by mutated kinases. in this sort of indication, a low
response rate in the clinic may in fact mask a high response rate
against a subset of tumours which are more responsive to the
inhibitor for pleiotropic, as opposed to monogenic, reasons.
multiple technologies which will allow this sort of information to be extracted from early clinical trials are now

small molecule  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors: clinical development of anticancer agents

available. for example, a primary medulloblastoma transcript expression 'fingerprint' (which includes elevated
 xxxg1709xxx  expression) has been identified that is diagnostic
for the presence or subsequent development of disseminated disease [74]. similarly, a serum protein pattern has
recently been identified which is diagnostic for the presence
of ovarian cancer [75]. application of such technologies to
pre-treatment surgical specimens or patient serum/plasma,
coupled with knowledge of subsequent patient clinical
response to treatment with a  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor,
could be used to develop similar molecular signatures,
which may be utilised for patient preselection and treatment in later trials.
5.2 dose selection:

establishing preclinical
pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic relationships for
translation to the clinic
as has been noted elsewhere [11,76], the emergence of selective
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors into clinical development poses a
challenge to the traditional cytotoxic paradigm of oncology
drug development, where phase i dose escalation is continued
until a maximum tolerated dose (mtd) is achieved. it has
been convincingly argued that it might be more logical to
escalate only until maximum inhibition of the target was
achieved [11,76].
prior to entering the clinic with such as a strategy, it is
essential to first elucidate the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship linking target modulation and antitumour efficacy in preclinical tumour models. such studies
have recently been presented for  xxxd3264xxx ,  xxxd252xxx  and
cp 549,632 [35,37,77]. these efforts indicate how several companies have incorporated hard lessons learned from earlier
compounds such as  xxxd3191xxx  (vegfr inhibitor from
sugen/pharmacia), which exhibited promising activity in
preclinical antitumour models [78], but failed to exhibit significant efficacy in a phase iii trial in colorectal cancer. with
the advent of new methods that have allowed direct assessment of the activity of  xxxd3191xxx  against  xxxg1274xxx  in vivo in
mice, it has become clear that the exposures achieved by
 xxxd3191xxx  in the clinic [79] were probably not able to inhibit
 xxxg1274xxx  with duration sufficient to realise clinical benefit
in patients with metastatic colorectal cancers.
it has been challenging in practical terms to measure
direct effects of  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors on their targets in
patients, but substantial progress has been made. seminal
studies in patients using inhibition of phosphorylation of the
bcr-abl substrate crkl in blood cells (imatinib) or of egfr
autophosphorylation in tumours and skin ( xxxd2186xxx ) have
demonstrated the feasibility of this approach [11,76,80]. however, in the case of all  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors in advanced
clinical development, even imatinib and  xxxd2186xxx , the standard clinical doses for phase iii studies have been established
based on traditional mtd-based criteria [11,80]. this situation is likely to change as technical advances lead to
increased ability to more sensitively and quantifiably meas58

ure inhibition of targets in patient tumours and/or surrogate
tissues. the availability of such technologies will allow rigorous testing of the hypothesis that administering the optimal
biological dose (based on target modulation) will result in
clinical efficacy comparable to/better than that achieved by
administering the mtd.
5.3 mechanism-based side effects
as current inhibitors progress through clinical development
and newer agents enter the clinic, evidence of mechanismbased toxicities is emerging. to date, these have been most
clearly defined for inhibitors of egfr, where administration of several small molecule inhibitors at therapeutic exposures results in development of a characteristic acneform
rash and gastrointestinal toxicity [28,80]. these effects are also
seen in patients treated with  xxxd467xxx , an egfr-blocking antibody [81]. strikingly, failure of  xxxd467xxx -treated patients to
develop this skin rash appeared to predict poorer responses
to treatment in at least one phase ii trial [81], indicating that
biomarkers of mechanism-based toxicity may have prognostic potential. the most straightforward explanation here is
that the acneform rash serves as a marker for functional
exposure (and consequent target modulation) in a visible
body compartment.
interestingly, rash and diarrhoea were among the most
commonly reported adverse events in phase i trials of selective
raf and mek inhibitors [82-84], suggesting that these toxicities
can be attributed to inhibition of signalling events downstream of the egfr→raf→mek→erk signalling axis. as
data emerge on toxicities of diverse targeted agents over the
coming years, a signalling-based map of major mechanismbased toxicities should begin to emerge, which will be valuable in anticipating potential toxicities of new agents.
for other targets, there is insufficient clinical data yet available to predict small-molecule-related side effects with any confidence. however, the safety profiles of imatinib and
bevacizumab [85], the most clinically advanced inhibitors of
split kinase domain rtk-dependent signalling, are encouraging in this regard. in three phase ii studies in cml, imatinib
was generally well-tolerated, with nausea, vomiting, myalgia,
oedema and diarrhoea being the most frequently observed
adverse events [46]. bevacizumab proved to be generally well-tolerated in a phase i study in patients with advanced cancer [85].
however, in three patients, severe bleeding was observed which
was believed to stem from the antitumour activity of the agent
[85]. treatment with vegf results in transient hypotension in
animals and humans via a  xxxg1274xxx -mediated pathway [86,87].
hence, it is not surprising that there are anecdotal reports that
vegfr inhibitors can also lead to/exacerbate hypertension in
susceptible patients. however, overall current clinical safety
data with imatinib, and with bevacizumab and other vegf/
vegfr inhibitors, coupled with their well-validated role in
tumour pathobiology, strongly support the selection of bcr-abl,
kit, the pdgf receptors and  xxxg1274xxx  as therapeutic targets
in cancer patients.

5.4 emergence of resistance
despite the promise of targeted therapies for cancer, there is
already evidence for the potential for emergence of resistance. five mechanisms by which cancer cells could become
resistant to selective  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors may be envisaged:

• amplification of target to boost signal
• mutation of target to prevent inhibitor binding
• compensatory augmentation of parallel signalling pathways
to bypass blockades in signal transduction
• loss of tumour suppressor pathway which previously mediated the inhibitory effect(s) of the kinase inhibitor
• upregulation of drug efflux pumps
emergence of resistance has already been encountered in a
fraction of cml and gist patients being treated with imatinib. the mechanistic bases for resistance have been best elucidated in cml and have recently been incisively reviewed
[88,89]. a recent study of nine cml patients who entered blast
crisis while being treated with imatinib revealed that all
exhibited either amplification of or catalytic domain mutations in bcr-abl [90]. it should be noted that in at least some
cases, this may not constitute true development of drug
resistance, but rather selective outgrowth of pre-existing subclones of cml cells [91].

it has recently been argued that resistance will develop more
rapidly to highly selective  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors than to
non-selective conventional cytotoxic agents [89]. however, this
argument may have less validity when considering cases where a
primary drug target is on non-transformed (and presumably
more genetically stable) cell types, such as endothelial cells.
many of the agents in table 2 could inhibit multiple targets
associated with several cell types in solid tumours (or bone marrow, in the case of haematological malignancies). for example,
as noted earlier, at equivalent exposures  xxxd3264xxx  would be
predicted to directly inhibit pdgfr- or kit-dependent
tumour cells while simultaneously inhibiting tumour vascular
endothelial cells (vegfr-dependent) and other tumour stromal cells, such as pericytes and fibroblasts (pdgfr-dependent). this hypothesis has been supported in preclinical target
modulation studies [35]. such complexity of mechanism (which
is potentially shared by  xxxd252xxx ) may delay or prevent the
emergence of resistance, at least in solid tumours.
lastly, it is important to note that the relative simplicity of
the mechanism of resistance to imatinib in cml is unlikely to
be replicated in solid tumours, where all five potential mechanisms of resistance may be encountered. hence, elucidating
mechanisms of resistance in these indications will require
employing exploratory, as well as focused, genomic and proteomic technologies.

opinion

selective  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors are now a valuable part of the
anticancer arsenal for a limited number of malignancies. based
on current progress, it seems likely that selective  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitors, as single agents or in combination with conventional
agents, will become an integral component of the standard of
care in many cancers by the end of the decade. to achieve this
goal, it will be imperative to employ cutting-edge technologies
to address pressing issues of patient preselection, dose selection,
mechanism-based toxicity and emerging drug resistance.
