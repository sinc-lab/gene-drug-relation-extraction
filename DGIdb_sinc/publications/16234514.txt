purpose
the aim of the study was to evaluate the predictive value of her2 and  xxxg2312xxx ␣
gene ( xxxg2311xxx ) for the efficacy of  xxxd2008xxx  in the adjuvant setting of breast cancer patients.
patients and methods
in the danish breast cancer cooperative group trial 89d, 980 pre- and postmenopausal primary
patients were randomly allocated to either cmf (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil; n ⫽ 500) or cef (cyclophosphamide,  xxxd2008xxx , and fluorouracil; n ⫽ 480) times 9, between
january 1990 and november 1999. tumor tissue was retrospectively identified from 805
patients and was analyzed for her2-positivity and for  xxxg2311xxx -amplifications and deletions.
results
her2-positivity was found in 33% of the 805 investigated tumors and was not a predictive
marker for  xxxd2008xxx  sensitivity.  xxxg2311xxx  changes were identified in 23% of the 773
investigated tumors: 12% had  xxxg2311xxx  amplifications and 11% had  xxxg2311xxx  deletions. we
found that patients with  xxxg2311xxx  amplification had an increased recurrence-free (rfs; hazard
ratio [hr], 0.43; 95% ci, 0.24 to 0.78) and overall survival (os; hr, 0.57; 95% ci, 0.29 to
1.13), respectively if treated with cef compared with cmf, and that patients with  xxxg2311xxx 
deletions had an almost identical hazard ratio (rfs: hr, 0.63; 95% ci, 0.36 to 1.11; os: hr,
0.56; 95% ci, 0.30 to 1.04). this is in contrast to patients with a normal  xxxg2311xxx  genotype for
whom similar outcome was observed in both treatment arms (rfs: hr, 0.90; 95% ci, 0.70
to 1.17; os: hr, 0.88; 95% ci, 0.66 to 1.17).
conclusion
 xxxg2311xxx  amplification—and possibly deletion—seems to be predictive markers for the effect
of adjuvant  xxxd2008xxx  containing therapy in primary breast cancer, but a final conclusion has
to await a confirmative study or a meta-analysis.

introduction

the early breast cancer trialists’ collaborative group’s overview analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of
recurrence and death with anthracycline-

containing regimens versus regimens without
anthracyclines.1 the danish breast cancer
cooperative group (dbcg) trial dbcg89-d is one such trial, and suggests that the
substitution of methotrexate in the cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (cmf)

regimen, with  xxxd2008xxx  will lead to a further 25% to 30%
proportional reduction in mortality.2 despite the significant
difference established in the group-wise comparison, the beneficial effect could be restricted to a minor part of the patients.
predictive factors would allow us to select those patients who
would benefit the most from  xxxd2008xxx , and thus spare the
remaining patients from the additional toxicity.
a number of retrospective studies have investigated
the predictive value of her2 overexpression and/or amplification and have raised the hypothesis that patients with her2positive tumors have an inborn increased sensitivity toward
anthracycline-containing therapy.3-5 but the results are somewhat nonconsistent and it has been hypothesized, that her2
is rather to be viewed as a marker for the real anthracycline
target  xxxg2312xxx ␣ (topoii␣). the  xxxg2312xxx ␣
gene ( xxxg2311xxx ) is located next to the her2 gene on chromosome 17q12-q21.
topoii␣ is a key enzyme during cell division, where it
creates a reversible double-strand dna break allowing the
two template stands to rotate freely and thus enable the
passage of a second dna double-strand through the break.
through binding to topoii␣ the anthracyclines stabilize the
dna double-strand breaks which may lead to apoptosis,
and topoii␣ is probably the primary molecular target of
anthracyclines.6 in vitro studies have hypothesized that amplification of  xxxg2311xxx  leads to overexpression of the topoii␣
enzyme and increased sensitivity to anthracyclines7-9 and
deletion to resistance.7 in a retrospective study,  xxxg2311xxx 
changes were identified in 84% of 70 breast cancer patients
with her2 amplified tumors.10 surprisingly deletions were
almost as frequent as amplifications, and were observed
concurrently in subsets of the tumors. the results from this
pivotal study lead to exploration of the possible predictive
value of  xxxg2311xxx  alterations for anthracycline-based chemotherapy in breast patients with her2 amplified tumors, but
a definitive answer has not been obtained.10-12
in a previous pilot-study, we observed  xxxg2311xxx  copy
number changes in approximately 50% of her2 amplified
breast tumors and in 5% of nonamplified breast tumors.13
in the present study we investigated the predictive value of
her2-positivity and  xxxg2311xxx  changes in dbcg trial 89-d, a
randomized comparison of intravenous cyclophosphamide,  xxxd2008xxx , and fluorouracil (cef) with cmf.
patients and methods
from january 1990 to november 1999, 1,195 patients were randomly assigned in the dbcg trial 89-d, hereof 980 danish patients were eligible for this retrospective study, while data and
tissue were not obtained from 215 swedish patients. patients were
included if they were a: premenopausal, node-negative and with
grade 2 or iii tumors ⱕ 5 cm; b: premenopausal with receptornegative or unknown tumors, greater than 5 cm or with positive
axillary lymph nodes; or c: postmenopausal with receptor7484

negative tumors, greater than 5 cm or with positive axillary lymph
nodes. following surgery (mastectomy, 79, 2% or lumpectomy,
19, 5% and axillary dissection) patients were randomly assigned in
a factorial 2 ⫻ 2 design to either nine cycles of cmf (cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, methotrexate 40 mg/m2, and fluorouracil
600 mg/m2) given intravenously (iv) on day one every 3 weeks,
nine cycles of cmf plus  xxxd2837xxx , nine cycles of cef (cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2,  xxxd2008xxx  60 mg/m2, and fluorouracil
600 mg/m2) given iv day once every 3 weeks, or nine cycles of cef
plus  xxxd2837xxx .  xxxd2837xxx  was given orally, 150 mg twice
daily for 4 years. six patients randomized to the cmf-arm received cef and 26 patients randomized to cef received cmf.
eighteen patients (13 randomly assigned to cef and five randomly assigned to cmf) never received chemotherapy and were
excluded from the predictive study. none of the remaining 962
patients received adjuvant tamoxifen. locoregional radiotherapy
was given after the first cycle of cmf or cef, and during radiotherapy two cycles of cef or cmf were substituted by single-agent
cyclophosphamide (900 mg/m2). radiotherapy was given against
the residual breast following lumpectomy (48 gy ⫹ boost 10 gy)
or chest wall following mastectomy if the tumor was greater than
5 cm (48 gy), and against regional nodes in node-positive disease
(48 gy). in all cases, 2 gy in five fractions per week. in the cmf
and cef groups, 206 (40.0%) and 173 (38.7%), respectively, received radiotherapy.
a number of variables were recorded prospectively, such as:
age at surgery, histologic type (ductal carcinoma nos, lobular
carcinomas, and other types), malignancy grade,14 size (largest
diameter of the invasive component), and numbers of removed
and positive axillary lymph nodes.
preparation of tissue
consecutive serial sections were cut at 4 ␮m from 805 available paraffin-embedded tumors for immunohistochemistry and
fish and stored cold until staining was performed. a slide stained
with hematoxylin and eosin, prepared from each block, was used for
confirmation of invasive carcinoma. all analyses were performed at
the department of pathology, roskilde hospital, denmark.
immunohistochemistry
the sections were stained within 5 days from cutting. certified
laboratory staff using a techmate immunostainer (dako) followed
the procedure for the herceptest (dakocytomation, glostrup, denmark) according to the manufacturers protocol. positive controls as
supplied with the kit were included as well as in house controls
together with a negative control for each case. the results were scored
0, 1⫹, 2⫹, and 3⫹ as recommended in the herceptest.
fish
two new kits, her2 fish pharmdx and  xxxg2311xxx  fish
pharmdx (dakocytomation, glostrup, denmark), were used according to the manufacturers’ manual, and as briefly described in
the pilot study.13
in cases of ductal carcinoma with an in situ component, the
negative control slide for herceptest was used to mark the invasive areas avoiding any possibility of including the in situ component. up to 60 gene signals (or the number closest to 60⫹) were
counted in nuclei with identifiable boundaries. optimally, only
signals distinctly separated from each other were included, but in
case of clusters due to high levels of amplification the number was
estimated. the ratio was calculated as the number of signals for the
gene probe (her2 and  xxxg2311xxx  respectively) divided by the number of signals for the centromere 17. cases were scored as her2 or

 xxxg2311xxx  as a predictive marker

 xxxg2311xxx  fish amplified when the ratio was ⱖ 2. a  xxxg2311xxx  deletion
is considered present when the ratio was less than 0.8 and this cut
point was in the absence of a biologically well-defined ratio based
on the work of di leo et al.11
her2 fish analysis was performed on all
herceptest 2ⴙ/3ⴙ positive specimens
all her2 (3⫹) positive tumors and her2 (2⫹) positive tumors
with her2 amplification investigated by fish (fluorescence in situ
hybridization; ratio ⱖ 2) were considered her2 positive.
statistical analysis
the primary outcome of interest was recurrence-free survival (rfs) calculated as the time from randomization until
first locoregional recurrence, distant recurrence, second malignancy, or death, and overall survival (os) calculated as the time
from randomization until death. follow-up time was quantified in terms of a kaplan-meier estimate of potential followup.15 association between  xxxg2311xxx -status and the classical
prognostic variables and her2 was investigated using contingency tables and ␹2 test. survival curves were constructed according to the kaplan-meier product-limit method and
compared using the log-rank test. multivariate survival analysis
was conducted using cox proportional hazards models with
backward selection.
the proportional hazard assumption was assessed graphically as well as by including a time-dependent component individually for each covariate. finally, putative interactions of each
covariate and the treatment parameter were investigated.
receptor-status and malignancy grade were found to violate
the proportional hazards assumption for both end points. furthermore, nonproportionality was seen for  xxxg2311xxx  status and
her2-positivity with respect to the end point os. for each end
point, nonproportionality was taken into account by stratifying
for those covariates that violated the proportional hazards assumption for that end point.
the backward selection procedure was applied separately
to each analysis. all nonstratification variables, including treatment, were exposed to selection. if removed, treatment was
re-entered into the reduced model after the selection procedure
was completed.
the estimated effect of treatment with cef within the
three subgroups consisting of  xxxg2311xxx  amplified,  xxxg2311xxx  deleted, and  xxxg2311xxx  normal patients, and within the two subgroups consisting of her2 positive and negative patients was
investigated in a cox proportional hazards models including
parameters representing the interaction of treatment with cef
and patient subgroup and the estimated effect of cef over cmf
in these groups was compared.
the predictive value of a given characteristic was quantified
by the hazard ratio (hr). the overall significance of interaction
terms with two or more df was assessed by a wald test.
all patient records were updated regarding disease status in
august 2002 and death in december 2003.
with an event rate of 50% and an estimated 20%  xxxg2311xxx 
positive patients,14 the number of events seems to be sufficient to
detect a true clinical relevant difference. all tests were conducted
with a 5% level of significance.
ethics
the data used and presented were all collected and analyzed
by the dbcg registry. the clinical study as well as the current
biologic substudy was conducted according to the helsinki decla-

ration and approved by the danish scientific ethical committees
(dbcg 89-d, v200.1616/89-v200.1623/89-12-089/01).
results

at the time of analysis, 217 (50%) patients treated with cmf
and 207 (56%) treated with cef and with available tumor
tissue blocks (n ⫽ 805), were still alive without recurrence.
median estimated potential follow-up time with respect to rfs was 8.06 years (95% ci, 7.77 to 8.46) for
patients treated with cef, and 8.09 years (95% ci, 7.61 to
8.63) for patients treated with cmf. median potential
follow-up time with respect to os was 10.40 years (95% ci,
9.86 to 10.80) for patients treated with cef and 10.28 years
(95% ci, 9.71 to 10.61) for patients treated with cmf.
the classical prognostic variables were equally distributed in the two treatment arms (table 1). the median
relative dose-intensities of the chemotherapy were identical, 0.97, in the two treatment groups.
blocks were unavailable for 175 (16%) of the 980 randomly assigned danish patients (fig 1). premenopausal patients were overrepresented among patients where tumor
blocks were unavailable as were patients with small tumors,
receptor positive tumors, low malignancy grade, and one to
three positive lymph nodes (␹2 test; p ⬍ .05). age and treatment were distributed equally between the two groups. a logrank test showed no difference in rfs or os between the
groups with and without available blocks (data not shown).

discussion

in this large-scale study, we found a relative reduction in the
risk of recurrence and death from breast cancer of around 50%
in patients with primary operable and  xxxg2311xxx  amplified breast
cancer that had been randomized to intravenous cef compared to cmf. the results of the present study confirms the
results of previous smaller studies that have suggested an increased sensitivity to anthracyclines in patients with  xxxg2311xxx 
amplified breast tumors in the adjuvant11 and locally advanced
setting.12,16,17 this in contrast to one negative neoadjuvant
study16 using immunohistochemistry.
in addition we found an almost equally predictive
value of  xxxg2311xxx  deletions, although with broad confidenceintervals—probably due to the low number of patients in
this group. this finding was not expected, as the hypothesis
was that deletions predicted anthracycline resistance. the
clinical importance of  xxxg2311xxx  deletions has not been analyzed earlier, most likely since only a relatively small number of patients with  xxxg2311xxx -deleted tumors have been
identified in previous studies. the molecular mechanisms
underlying the adjacent her2 amplification and  xxxg2311xxx 
gene deletion are unknown, as is the breakpoint, size, and
functionality of the deleted  xxxg2311xxx  segment. the question
of the predictive value of  xxxg2311xxx  deletion has to await a
confirmative study or a meta-analysis, pooling data together from large-scaled phase iii trails.
the predictive value of  xxxg2311xxx -amplifications was not
seen for the end point os, probably because recurrence is a
more precise measurement than death as patients often have

 xxxg2311xxx  as a predictive marker

received other treatment— containing anthracyclines—after
their first relapse, and the effect of treatment therefore would
confound the true predictive impact of the  xxxg2311xxx  status.
in the present study, the predictive value of  xxxg2311xxx 
may have been less significant due to the use of methotrexate in the comparative regimen and the addition cyclophosphamide and fluorouracil in both treatment arms.
we found no evidence that the superiority of cef over
cmf with respect to rfs and os was greater for her2positive patients than her2-negative (ie, no interaction
between her2 status and treatment was seen.) previous studies have reported inconsistent results concerning her2 as a
predictive marker for anthracycline-sensitivity, and the literature has recently been reviewed on several occasions.3-5 in
brief, eight larger adjuvant studies have been published.11,18-25
three studies found a significant interaction between treatment with anthracycline and her2-status,19-21 four studies
found no interaction, but either a trend in the interaction
analysis, or a risk reduction from anthracycline treatment in
the her2-positive patients.11,18,22-24 two of the studies were
repeated, with the same patient material, but with other antibodies, and no interaction was found.18,23
in the present study her2 status was insufficient as a
screening-tool for  xxxg2311xxx  amplifications or deletions, regardless of whether it was determined with ihc alone or a combination of ihc and fish. almost 8% of the her2-negative
patients had  xxxg2311xxx  changes and this would have been overlooked, had all the tumor samples not been analyzed. this is in
accordance with the findings from our preceding pilot study
where we found 4.4% (95% ci, 1.7 to 10.9)  xxxg2311xxx  amplifications or deletions among the 90 her2 negative tumors.13
prescreening with her2 was originally proposed by järvinen
et al26 in 1996, based on coexpression by ihc of topoii␣ and
her2. later the same group27 used fish to study copy num-

ber aberrations of both  xxxg2311xxx  and her2 in nine breast cancer
cell lines and in 97 breast tumors, which were selected for the
study according to their her2 status by southern blotting. of
57 her2-amplified primary breast carcinomas, 23 (44%)
showed  xxxg2311xxx  coamplification and 24 (42%) showed a physical deletion of the  xxxg2311xxx  gene. no  xxxg2311xxx  alterations were
found in 40 primary tumors without her2 amplification. di
leo et al11 estimated the prevalence of  xxxg2311xxx  amplification to
be 6%, in a node-positive group of patients. we found the
prevalence of  xxxg2311xxx  amplification in our study to be 12% and
furthermore 11% had  xxxg2311xxx  deletions.
in conclusion, her2-status gave no additional predictive information regarding anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. but in this large scaled randomized predictive
study, we identified a group of patients with  xxxg2311xxx  amplifications, who benefited particularly from anthracyclinecontaining chemotherapy and found indications, although
not statistically significant that an additional group of patients, the  xxxg2311xxx  deleted patients, also benefited from
treatment with anthracycline. based on the currently accepted biologic hypothesis, an increased sensitivity to anthracyclines was unexpected in patients with  xxxg2311xxx 
deletions and confirmation should be awaited before implementation. a large-scale meta-analysis based on centralized
reevaluation on  xxxg2311xxx  has already been organized, and
samples from the current study will be included.
