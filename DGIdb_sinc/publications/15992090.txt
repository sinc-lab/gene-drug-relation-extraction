drug evaluation

risperidone (risperdal™) is a benzisoxazole derivative with a high affinity
for serotonin 5-ht2 and dopamine d2 receptors, and some affinity for alphaadrenergic, histamine h1 and dopamine d1 receptors. it has no anticholinergic effects. early studies demonstrated risperidone to be an effective
medication for psychotic symptoms, probably more so than the older
neuroleptics for both positive and negative symptoms. at clinically effective
doses, risperidone causes no more extrapyramidal side-effects (eps) than
placebo; at higher doses eps frequency increases in a dose-dependent
manner. since it became available in 1994, extensive experience with the
drug supports favourable early impressions of efficacy and tolerability.
minimal sedation, relatively little weight gain and absence of anticholinergic manifestations contribute to the relative tolerability of risperidone
as compared to older neuroleptics. however, risperidone is associated with
hyperprolactinaemia which can result in amenorrhoea and sexual dysfunction. compared to older neuroleptics, pharmacoeconomic studies have
shown that use of risperidone is associated with reduced hospitalisation
and direct cost savings. a recent study found equivalent efficacy between
risperidone and clozapine for treatment-resistant patients. two studies
comparing risperidone and olanzapine have yielded positive but
conflicting findings. the overall positive experience with risperidone has
resulted in the drug being widely recommended as a first line treatment
option for psychoses.

introduction

antipsychosis drugs represent the cornerstone treatment for schizophrenia
[1]. first reports of chlorpromazine use in psychoses were made in 1952 by
hamon, paraire and velluz in mania, then delay and deniker in schizophrenia [2]. chlorpromazine and related drugs were observed to be
‘tranquillising’ (hence the term ‘major tranquilliser’) and to induce eps. the
causation of eps was held by delay and deniker to be one of the defining
characteristics of this group of drugs, thereby naming them neuroleptics
(from the greek, to capture or seize the neurone) [3].
the efficacy of neuroleptics in acute treatment and relapse prevention of
psychotic illnesses has been demonstrated in hundreds of studies. the
availability of neuroleptics facilitated the process of de-institutionalisation

444 risperidone (risperdal): clinical experience with a new antipsychosis drug
over the last 40 years; the vast majority of people with
chronic psychoses now live in the community.
however, the absence of a separation between doses
relieving psychosis and doses inducing eps inherent
in neuroleptic activity, resulted in negative treatment
experience for many patients, referred to as the
‘zombie’ effect [4]. clinically significant eps (including
dystonia, parkinsonism and akathisia) occur in up to
90% of patients on conventional neuroleptics [5].
parkinsonism not only causes rigidity and bradykinesia, but also apathy, anergia, cognitive slowing and
depression [6].
tardive dyskinesia is a syndrome of repetitive
involuntary movements occurring with long-term
neuroleptic exposure and is usually irreversible. while
average prevalence is mostly estimated at approximately 20% among at-risk patients, some groups (such
as the elderly) are at much greater risk [7].

subsequently sulpiride, were less prone to cause eps,
and were therefore characterised as atypical
neuroleptics [11]. in 1988, clozapine was
demonstrated to be more effective than chlorpromazine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but with
a significant rate of potentially fatal agranulocytosis
[12]. while precise mechanisms of atypicality were not
clear, it was apparent that compounds needed to
demonstrate selectivity of action in mesolimbic
dopamine brain areas (thought relevant to the
antipsychotic effect), while sparing nigrostriatal
pathways (associated with eps) [13].
the selective  xxxg656xxx  activity of
sulpiride, a substituted benzamide, facilitated the
development of  xxxd3096xxx . clinically this was a
promising antipsychotic [14], but use was then
curtailed because of an association with aplastic
anaemia.

despite undoubted efficacy, conventional neuroleptics are not fully effective in approximately half of
patients with schizophrenia who continue to manifest
symptoms even with treatment. particularly resistant
are negative symptoms (flat affect, poverty of thought,
social withdrawal, lack of motivation), and it is
probable that conventional neuroleptics actually
worsen negative symptoms through induction of
parkinsonism, which mimics negative symptoms [8].
positive symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, thought
disorder) can be resistant to treatment in about a third
of patients; negative symptoms are also usually
present in these patients, usually designated as
suffering from ‘treatment-resistant’ illness [9].

the neurochemical profiles of clozapine and
thioridazine are broad. the development of risperidone, a benzisoxazole derivative, was stimulated by
experimental evidence that combination of dopamine
d2 and serotonergic  xxxg1113xxx  blockade led to
greater efficacy against negative symptoms of schizophrenia, with fewer eps than d2 blockade alone [15].
risperidone, a compound with potent 5-ht2a antagonism and less potent d2 antagonism, was then
developed [16]. it became widely available for clinical
use after first being licensed in 1993. subsequently
olanzapine, quetiapine and  xxxd3195xxx  have been
introduced into clinical use, and other drugs are in
development.

psychoses (such as schizoaffective disorder, bipolar
mania and depression, psychotic unipolar depression
and delusional disorders, as well as schizophrenia)
are all associated with some degree of positive
symptomatology, while negative symptoms tend to be
associated with schizophrenia-related disorders.
conversely, mania and depression, often associated
with aggression and self-injurious behaviour, can
occur across the psychosis spectrum. efficacy of
neuroleptics for positive symptoms has been
demonstrated across psychotic disorders; the drugs
are truly antipsychotic rather than antischizophrenic
[10]. mood abnormality is less responsive to conventional neuroleptics, and depression may be
exacerbated by treatment.

the widespread use of risperidone over the last five
years has generated a great deal of data and clinical
observations. in turn, the ways clinicians prescribe
risperidone, particularly with respect to dose and
dose titration, has been evolving gradually. this paper
will selectively review both core information and
recent findings concerning risperidone.

by the 1980s it was increasingly recognised that

risperidone

risperidone is derived from a new class of antipsychosis drugs, the benzisoxazoles. its structure, as well
as that of other indicative antipsychotics, is given in
figure 1. while part of the molecule resembles
haloperidol, the other side of the structure is probably
responsible for substantially different properties.

the drug has been extensively used by clinicians for
five years (over 1,400,000 patients have taken the
drug) and in this time has proven to be an effective,
safe and well-tolerated antipsychotic in schizophrenia
and other psychoses. it has demonstrated low liability
for eps at effective therapeutic doses, although eps
do occur in a dose-dependent manner at higher
doses. absence of anticholinergic side-effects, low
propensity for weight gain, minimal sedation and
tendency to induce hyperprolactinaemia are the
major distinguishing characteristics in comparison to
clozapine and olanzapine [18].
2.1

pharmacodynamics

the in vitro receptor binding profile of risperidone
and its active metabolite  xxxd2830xxx  is given in
figure 2. highest affinity is for the serotonin 5-ht2a
receptor. there are fewer affinities for 5-ht7 ,
dopamine d2, a-adrenergic 1 and 2, and the histamine
h1 receptors. there is no significant affinity for
cholinergic receptors.
 xxxg656xxx  antagonism is essential for the
antipsychotic effect of neuroleptics (which is thought
to occur in mesolimbic areas of the brain), but is also
linked to the production of eps (thought to occur in
nigrostriatal regions) and secretion of prolactin (due
to d 2 blockade on the surface of pituitary
lactotrophs). that risperidone is a much more potent
antagonist of 5-ht2a receptors than d2 receptors, may

explain its reduced propensity for eps and efficacy for
negative symptoms [17,19].
positron emission tomography studies using d2
probes in patients treated with neuroleptics have
shown that antipsychotic effects occur at 70 - 80% d2
blockade, and higher d2 occupancy is associated with
the occurrence of eps [20]. risperidone 1 mg orally
caused 50% d2 blockade and 60% 5-ht2 blockade in
normals [21], while doses of 3 mg - 4 mg per day in
patients resulted in d2 blockade below eps threshold
[22].
alpha 1 receptor antagonism, associated with risperidone, may account for its tendency to cause postural
hypotension (and reflex tachycardia), particularly
early on in treatment (as tachyphylaxis rapidly
occurs). antihistaminic effects probably contribute to
sedation. cholinergic blockade results in a variety of
peripheral and central effects which tend to be
clinically problematic. the absence of these effects
with risperidone is a major advantage over other
antipsychosis drugs [16].
2.2

pharmacokinetics

risperidone absorption occurs rapidly and is
unaffected by food. peak plasma concentrations are
reached within 2 h of oral administration. it is metabolised through hydroxylation and oxidative
n-dealkylation. the main metabolite is
 xxxd2830xxx , which is also an antipsychotic, so

that the active fraction comprises risperidone plus
 xxxd2830xxx . the proportion of risperidone to
 xxxd2830xxx  depends on  xxxd1818xxx 
metaboliser status: risperidone constitutes 46% of
peak radioactivity in an extensive metaboliser, and
80% in a poor metaboliser. risperidone half-life is 2 - 3
h in an extensive metaboliser. half-life of
 xxxd2830xxx  is 20 - 24 h. plasma concentrations
are dose-proportional [23]. half-life is increased in the
elderly and those with renal insufficiency, while
effects are accentuated in patients with hepatic failure
[24].

3. clinical

efficacy

most of the evidence concerning efficacy of risperidone has been obtained from patients with
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. the heterogeneity of these illnesses, with respect to
symptomatology (described above) and illness phase,
is now recognised to be so great that overall efficacy
measures need to be augmented by examination of
findings for particular subsyndromes or symptoms (eg
positive symptoms, negative symptoms, depressive
syndrome). furthermore, there are major differences
in response between patients in various illness phases
(e.g. first episode psychosis, relapse, treatmentresistant illness). subgroups of these patients also
need to be evaluated separately in schizophrenia
treatment studies. failure to address symptom and
illness phase heterogeneity, is probably responsible
for the widely differing results between studies in this
area.
3.1

typical neuroleptics versus risperidone

a number of double-blind studies have compared
risperidone with haloperidol, with and without
placebo [25-31]. subject and study characteristics and
doses of drugs have differed considerably. overall,
risperidone emerged as either equal to haloperidol, or
superior to the standard drug in overall outcome.
the most frequently cited study was carried out in
north america [29]. it enrolled 523 inpatients, mostly
with chronic schizophrenia, who were randomised to
risperidone 2, 6, 10 or 16 mg, haloperidol 20 mg or
placebo, for eight weeks. there was a 48% dropout
rate. risperidone 6, 10 and 16 mg, and haloperidol 20
mg were superior to placebo on positive symptom
improvement. risperidone 6 mg and 16 mg were
superior to haloperidol 20 mg on positive symptoms.

negative symptoms were improved compared to
placebo by 6 and 16 mg of risperidone; haloperidol
was ineffective. the single 20 mg haloperidol dose in
this study may have been too high for some of the
patients, thereby disadvantaging the haloperidol
treatment arm [51].
another study [31] carried out in europe (including
britain), south africa and south america (called the
international study) tested 1362 patients for eight
weeks on risperidone 1, 4, 8, 12 and 16 mg versus
haloperidol 10 mg (which is in our experience closer
to average current haloperidol doses). most of the
patients suffered from chronic schizophrenia. there
was a 25% drop out rate. the most effective doses of
risperidone were 4 and 8 mg, although improvement
was also seen with other risperidone doses (including
1 mg daily). there was significantly greater reduction
in total symptoms in the risperidone 4, 8 and 16 mg
groups than patients on 1 mg. changes in total
symptoms in the risperidone 12 mg and haloperidol
groups did not differ significantly from the risperidone
1 mg group. decreases in positive and negative
symptoms did not differ between risperidone and
haloperidol. this study has also been criticised for its
single-dose haloperidol arm.
a variable dose study of six weeks duration (risperidone mean 9.7 mg, haloperidol 18 mg) reported
symptom reduction in 60% of patients on risperidone
and 25% of those on haloperidol [25]. two studies
using 5 and 10 mg of risperidone and haloperidol (in
62 patients) for eight weeks in the first [30], and 2 to 20
mg (in 35 patients) in the second [26], did not find
differences in outcome. a 12 week study comparing
12 mg risperidone and 10 mg haloperidol found
risperidone superior [28]. patient numbers were
relatively small in each of these studies.
perphenazine (mean dose 28 mg) was compared to
risperidone (mean dose 8.5 mg) over eight weeks [32].
of 107 patients enrolled, 29 dropped out. significantly
greater improvement was observed in overall
outcome for patients who took risperidone.
meta-analyses have been carried out using polled
study data. four reports have been published, with
some differences concerning studies entered and
method of evaluation. the first analysis examined five
trials and found that risperidone (6 mg -12 mg per
day) was significantly more effective than typical
medications [33]. three analyses have used the
criterion of at least 20% improvement in total
symptoms as the response measure. two studies
exp. opin. invest. drugs (1999) 8(4)

448 risperidone (risperdal): clinical experience with a new antipsychosis drug
pooled double-blind studies comparing risperidone
with haloperidol. both found risperidone to be more
effective [34,35], the second finding a mean difference
of 13.9% between risperidone and haloperidol in
response rate. a meta-analysis pooling 11 mixed
comparator studies found risperidone to be superior
to placebo, and patients on risperidone were 11%
more likely to respond than those on comparator
drugs [36]. it would be interesting if heterogeneity
across studies (such as differences in dose of
haloperidol) was also investigated through
meta-analyses.
while the above meta-analyses focused on overall
response, the effects of risperidone and conventional
neuroleptics on negative symptoms in pooled studies
have also been examined [37]. six double-blind
studies were entered and response was defined as at
least 20% improvement in negative symptoms.
patients treated with risperidone were 1.43 times
more likely to show a significant negative symptom
reduction than those on standard drugs; a substantial
benefit for 43% of patients.
3.2

first episode psychosis

a double-blind multicentre six week trial recruited
183 patients with first episode schizophreniform
disorder and schizophrenia, 75% of whom completed
the study. mean end-point dose of risperidone was 6.1
mg and haloperidol 5.6 mg. a reduction of at least 50%
in symptom scores was observed in 63% of risperidone patients and in 56% of haloperidol patients.
patients who received less than 6 mg per day risperidone improved significantly more than those on
higher doses, suggesting that the risperidone doses in
the flexible study protocol were too high [38]. as first
episode patients respond well to conventional
antipsychotics, the equivalent efficacy response
between risperidone and haloperidol was expected.
however significant advantages for risperidone were
observed in lower frequency of eps.

and 65% of clozapine patients had reduced symptom
scores at least 20%, suggesting equivalent efficacy
between the two compounds in chronic schizophrenia. the dose of clozapine used in this study may
be somewhat low: in our recent survey the mean
clozapine dose for stable outpatients was 377 mg/day
[46].
3.4

there have been two double-blind studies comparing
risperidone with olanzapine. in the first, 339 patients
participated in a 28 week study, in which the mean
modal dose of risperidone was 7.2 mg/day, and of
olanzapine 17.2 mg/day.
effectiveness of both drugs was similar, except that
olanzapine demonstrated significantly greater
reduction on one of the two negative symptom rating
scales. significantly more patients on olanzapine
(88%) maintained their response to 28 weeks than on
risperidone (67%) [39].
a more recent study of eight weeks duration enrolled
407 patients; mean modal doses of risperidone and
olanzapine were 4.8 mg/day and 12.5 mg/day respectively. at the end of the study there were no
differences between the two groups in overall
symptom scores or negative symptoms. however,
risperidone was associated with greater improvement
in positive symptoms and anxiety/depression [40].
3.5

the superiority of clozapine to chlorpromazine in
treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients has been
established [12]. eighty-six patients resistant or
intolerant to conventional neuroleptics were assigned
to risperidone or clozapine in an eight week doubleblind study [59]. final doses of clozapine and risperidone were 291.2 mg and 6.4 mg per day respectively.
at the end of the study, 67% of risperidone patients

cognitive dysfunction

patients with schizophrenia, particularly those with
negative symptoms, also frequently manifest
cognitive dysfunction: distractibility, impaired
working memory and problems with executive
function [41]. risperidone has been observed to
improve cognitive functioning in patients with schizophrenia [42,43], particularly in contrast to
conventional neuroleptics [44].
3.6

pharmacoeconomic impact

a number of studies have found that use of risperidone is associated with reductions in days spent in
hospital [45,48]. although risperidone is more
expensive than older neuroleptics, greater efficacy
should result in improved efficiency. substantial
savings in direct treatment costs have indeed been
noted in long-term treatment [47]. in a canadian study
comparing 146 patients before and after starting
risperidone, cost savings (primarily due to reduction
in hospitalisation) were estimated to be $can7925 per
exp. opin. invest. drugs (1999) 8(4)

keks & culhane 449
patient per year [48]. cost comparisons between
risperidone and olanzapine in acute settings suggest
that the cost of risperidone treatment is less than that
of olanzapine [49].
3.7

use of risperidone in other psychoses

there have been a number of case reports and open
uncontrolled trials of risperidone in other psychotic
disorders. efficacy has been reported in bipolar mood
disorder (mania and depression), psychotic depression, delusional disorder, autistic disorder and
dementia [53-57]. as it is quite likely that psychosis
represents a final common neurochemical pathway,
the efficacy of risperidone is to be expected across the
psychosis spectrum.
risperidone has also been used successfully in
non-psychotic disorders such as borderline personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder [58].
4. safety
4.1

and tolerability

extrapyramidal side-effects

the hallmark of an atypical antipsychotic drug is
lower propensity for eps. the reduced liability of
risperidone to cause eps was clearly demonstrated in
early studies, particularly the two fixed dose studies.
in the large international study [31] risperidone equal
to, or below 12 mg per day, caused less eps than
haloperidol 10 mg/day. in the north america study,
the use of anticholinergics for risperidone 16 mg/day
(42%) approached the rate for 20 mg/day haloperidol
(53%). risperidone below 10 mg per day was associated with eps comparable to placebo [29].
meta-analyses of pooled studies clearly support the
superiority of risperidone over haloperidol and other
neuroleptics with respect to eps occurrence [34-36].
although risperidone has been implicated in causing
tardive dyskinesia, the degree of risk is unknown.
monitoring of adverse effects to date suggests that
risperidone is less likely to cause tardive dyskinesia
than conventional neuroleptics [38].
4.2

other side-effects

risperidone can be associated with transient drowsiness (probably no greater than haloperidol) and
postural hypotension (which is avoided by dose
titration) [6]. weight gain, reduced sexual interest and
erectile dysfunction have also been observed [31].
risperidone is associated with a dose-dependent

hyperprolactinaemia. of the two risperidoneolanzapine studies, the study where the mean dose of
risperidone was 4.8 mg/day noted few prolactinrelated adverse effects [40] than the higher dose study
[39]. hyperprolactinaemia may cause amenorrhoea,
sexual dysfunction and galactorrhoea.

5.

dose of risperidone

the above data demonstrates that with respect to both
efficacy and tolerability, risperidone depends
critically on optimal dose selection to achieve best
clinical results. a recent survey of mean clinical dose
of risperidone in stable outpatients found that it was
4.2 mg per day [49]. a recent review of the evidence
suggests that the optimal risperidone dose should be 6
mg or less. however some groups (such as first
episode patients), may well benefit from much lower
doses. in the individual, patient the clinician has to
find the optimal dose by slow titration and careful
observation, with dose reduction if eps occur [50,51].
some early clinical experience with risperidone may
have been sub-optimal due to too rapid titration, use
of excessive doses, which may be less effective than
lower doses while causing eps, and failure to
recognise anticholinergic withdrawal at commencement of risperidone treatment if previous drugs with
anticholinergic properties were withdrawn too
abruptly [52].

6.

conclusion

risperidone has now been widely available to
clinicians for five years. at the time of its introduction,
there was little information concerning the manner in
which the new generation of atypical antipsychosis
drugs should be best used; some of the early studies
were vulnerable to criticism with respect to aspects of
methodology, such as dose. subsequent studies and a
great deal of clinical experience, now enables much
firmer conclusions about the place of risperidone in
the treatment of psychotic illnesses.
risperidone is an effective antipsychotic, probably
more effective for both positive and negative
symptoms than conventional neuroleptics. it is also
helpful for cognitive dysfunction associated with
schizophrenia. substantial pharmacoeconomic
benefits have been observed when patients use
risperidone, primarily because of the reduction in
hospital use. at maximally effective doses (under 6
exp. opin. invest. drugs (1999) 8(4)

450 risperidone (risperdal): clinical experience with a new antipsychosis drug
mg/day), risperidone is associated with low risk of
eps. it may cause sedation, postural hypotension,
weight gain and hyperprolactinaemia. however most
patients tolerate risperidone extremely well. risperidone is recommended as a first line treatment option
for psychoses.
