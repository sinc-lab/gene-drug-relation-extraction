in radioligand binding experiments, mdl 73147ef and mdl 74156 inhibited the binding of [~h]gr65630 to 5-hydroxytryptamine~ (5-ht~) binding sites on membranes prepared from ngi08-15 neuroblastoma× glioma cells. the calculated
dissociation constants (k l) were 20.03 + 6.58 and 0.44 _+0.18 nm, respectively (means _+ s.e.m., n = 6 and 9, respectively).
application of 5-ht (10-50 #m) to voltage-clamped ng108-15 cells elicited a rapidly desensitizing inward membrane current,
characteristic for the activation of 5-ht 3 receptors. the 5-ht-induced membrane current was suppressed in a reversible,
concentration-dependent manner by mdl 73147ef and mdl 74156ef. the concentrations required to block half the 5-ht
response (ic50)were 3.8 and 0.1 nm, respectively. it is concluded that both compounds are potent and reversible antagonists at
5-ht 3 receptors in this neuroblastoma cell line.

1. introduction

m d l 73147ef (1h-indole-3-carboxylic acid, transoctahydro-3-oxo-2,6-methano-2h-quinolizin-8-yl ester,
methanesulphonate) is a novel pseudopelletierine
derivative with pharmacological properties characteristic of 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-ht 3) receptor antagonists (fig. 1a; gittos and fatmi, 1989). in the peripheral nervous system, the compound blocks the von
bezold-jarisch reflex induced by intravenous injection
of 5-ht into anesthetized rats and antagonizes the
depressant effects of 5-ht on the isolated, perfused
rabbit heart (gittos and fatmi, 1989; hibert et al.,
1990). in the central nervous system, it has been reported that m d l 73147ef displaces [3h](s)-zacopride
from homogenates of rat entorhinal cortex (barnes et
al., 1990) and reduces the number of discharging neurons in the ventral tegmental area and the substantia
nigra (sorensen et al., 1989). finally, in the healthy
human volunteers, m d l 73147ef inhibits the flare
response to intradermal 5-ht (hinze et al., 1989).
several clonal cell lines have been shown to express
5-ht 3 receptors, including ng108-15 (hoyer and neijt,

1989). radioligand binding assays (hoyer and neijt,
1987; sharif e t a [ . , 1991) have demonstrated a single
binding site and electrophysiological experiments indicate that in these cells 5-ht s receptors tire directly
coupled to cation permeable ion channels, which transiently open in the presence of the agonist (derkach et
al., 1989; lambert et al., 1989; yakel et al., 1990). thus
clonal cell lines represent a simple in vitro model
system fl)r the biochemical and functional characterization of 5-ht s receptor ligands.
preliminary experiments in animals and healthy, human w)lunteers (dow and haegelc, 1991) have indicated that m d l 73147ef is metabolized to the reduced ketone derivative m d l 7415~ (1h-indole-3carboxylic acid, trans-octahydro-3-hydroxy-2,6-methano-2h-quinolizin-8-yl ester: fig. 1b). the aim of the
present experiments was to study the actions of m i ) l
73147ef, m d l 74156 and the known 5-ht~ receptor
antagonist ics 205-930 ((3~-tropanyl)-lh-indolc-3carboxylic acid ester; richardson et al., 1985) on 5-ht~
receptors in ngi08-15 cells, using radioligand binding
and electrophysiological techniques. in this way it was
hoped to characterize more fully the cellular actions of
these compounds.

2. materials and methods

2.1. ('ell czdture teclmiques
ngi08-15 mouse n c u r o b l a s t o m a × r a t glioma hybrid cells were cultured in dulbecco's modified eagle's
medium containing 4.5 g / l glucose and supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum at 37°c in an atmosphere of
5';~ c o , . the medium was changed every 2 days. for
clectrophysiological experiments the cells were plated
out lit low density in 35-mm petri dishes 2-5 days
before usc.

2. 2. radioli#and hindin<g studies
confluent ng108-15 cell monolayers were dissociated in versene (gibco) and centrifuged at 1000 rpm
for 5 min. the resulting pellet was homogenized in l(t
volumes of 0.32 m sucrose with 10 strokes of a dounce
glass homogenizer. the suspension was centrifuged at
44000 ×,~ for 15 rain and the pellet was resuspended
in 5 volumes 10 mm h e p e s - k o h buffer (ph 7.4),
using a polytron homogenizer. the membranes were
stored at
8(1°c and washed once in 50 mm h e p e s koh buffer immediately before use.
radioligand binding assays were performed in triplicate with 100 /,tl of 1 nm [sh]gr65630, 50 /.tl of test
compound (0.1 nm to 1 /,tm in 50 mm h e p e s - k o h
buffer at ph 7.4), and 2/)t) p,l of m e m b r a n e suspension
(0.1-0.2 m g / a s s a y tube) in a final volume of 0.5 ml.

incubations were carried out tit 37o( ` for 30 rain and
were terminated by filtration through g f / b glass fiber
filters presoaked in 0.1(f polyethylenciminc. "l'hc filters were then rinsed twice with 5 m[ ice-cold ttepeskoh buffer lind transferred to scintillation vials containing 4 ml ready protein (beckman). protein was
determined with the bradford dye method (bradford.
1976). non-specific binding was defined with 100 # m
metoclopramide. data were analyzed by non-linear
regression analysis with software written in rsfll (release 4.01, bbn software products). the k i vahics
were computed as i('5./(1 + l / k i ~ ) , where l = t h c
concentration of the radioligand ((i.2 nm) and kl~ the
dissociation constant of the radioligand (0.7 nm).
2.,7. t~lectrophysiolo,~:v
the membrane current was measured using the
whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique
(hamill et al., 1981). for the electrophysiology experiments, the culture dishes were placed on the stage of
an inverted microscope (nikon, diaphot) and observed
at 320 x magnification with phase contrast optics and
white light. throughout the experiments, the culture
dish was perfused lit 4 m l / m i n with a physiological
sohition of the following composition (mm): naci 14(t;
kci 5; m g c 1 2 ' 6 h , o 1: c a c i ~ - 2 h , o 2: hepes 5:
d-glucose, 5.6. the ph was adjusted to 7.4 by addition
of n a o h (approximately 2 ml of 1 m n a o h per liter).
the experiments were performed at 25-31i°(l
patch pipettes (ca. 1 # m ) were pulled from 1 mm
borosilicate glass (gci00-10, clark eleetromedical instruments, england) and filled with an artificial intracelhllar fluid of the following composition (ram): kgluconate 150: m g c i : . 6 h , o 2: c a c i , . 2 h , o ill;
h e p e s 5: e g t a 1.1; mg-atp 5; i ] - g t p (i.l. the ph
was adjusted to 7.2 with koh (approximately 4 ml of i
m k o h / i ) . pipettes were connected to the input stage
of a commercial w)ltagc-clamp amplifier (axopatch
1d, axon instruments, burlinghame, california,
u.s.a.) via a chlorided silver wire.
after formation of gigohm seals (1-5 g.(?) on single,
isolated cells, the pipette capacitance was compensated
fl)r and dc offset potentials were zeroed. the wholecell recording configuration was established by applying mild suction to the interior of the pipette. cells
were voltage clamped at - 5 0 mv and the series resistance (8.1 + (t.3 m,q: n 20) was measured. 5-ht (1(i
or 5(i # m , dissolved in krebs solution) was pressure
ejected onto the cells from a micropipette (tip diameter approximately 1 /,tin) via an electronically controlled pneumatic valve.
the test compounds were initially dissolved in h ~o
to form 1 mm stock solutions and then further diluted
with krebs solution. the compounds were applied in
fixed concentrations via the superfusion fluid for peri-

ods of at least 5 min, and 5-ht was applied to the cell
at intervals of 5 min. the peak amplitude of the
5-ht-induced current measured in antagonist-containing solution was expressed as a percentage of the
control response measured immediately before addition of antagonist to the krebs solution.
the membrane current was recorded on a digital
storage oscilloscope (hameg hm408), a chart recorder
(gould instruments ta 2000) and a personal computer
(compaq 386/20e) running pclamp software (axon
instruments). means, s.d., s.e.m. and unpaired t-tests
were calculated with the program lnstat (graphpad
software, san diego, california, u.s.a.). curve-fitting
was done with lnplot (graphpad software). unless
otherwise indicated, quantitative data are expressed as
means ± s.e.m.

nen dupont (boston, ma).

3. r e s u l t s

3.1. ligand binding
in the present experiments the specific binding of
[3h]gr65630 accounted for approximately 60-80% of
the total binding. scatchard analysis indicated the presence of a single population of binding sites with a
dissociation constant (k d) of 0.7 nm and a site concentration (b ...... ) of approximately 180 f m o l / m g protein.
in competition binding experiments with m d l
73147ef, m d l 74156 and ics 205-930, inhibition
curves were obtained which were monophasic and
showed a best fit for a one-site model (fig. 2). the
calculated dissociation constants (k~) for the three
compounds were 20.03 ± 6.58, 0.44 ± 0.18 and 0.3 ± 0.1
nm, respectively ( m e a n s ± s.e.m., n = 6, nine and
three experiments, respectively).

and then decayed back to baseline within about 30 s.
the amplitude of the 5-ht-induced current in control
solution was 437_+ 99 pa (n = 21). as previously described in these cells (yakel et al., 1991), a sustained
(10 s) application of 5-ht elicited a rapidly desensitizing response, the current decreasing by 77 ± 10% (n =
6) by the end of the application period. membrane
resistance, calculated from the response to a 20 mv
hyperpolarizing voltage command, was 2.2 +_ 0.4 g~q,
n=21.
bath application of mdl 73147ef (0.3-100 nm) or
mdl 74156ef (0.03-3 rim) did not alter the resting
membrane current but significantly reduced the amplitude of the 5-ht-induced inward current in a concentration-dependent manner. figures 3a and b illustrate
the results from two representative cells and it can be
seen that a 5-min application of either 10 nm mdl
73147ef or 1 nm mdl 74156ef almost completely
blocked the agonist response in a reversible manner. a
series of such experiments was performed and the
resulting mean concentration-response curves are illustrated in fig. 3c. the concentration of antagonist
required to block half the 5-ht-induced inward current (1cs0) was estimated from these curves to be 3.8
and 0.1 nm for mdl 73147ef and mdl 74156ef,
respectively. ics 205-930 at a concentration of 1 nm
reduced the 5-ht-induced membrane current to 10.7
+ 2.0% of control (mean ± s.e.m.; n = 6). the magnitude of this effect was not significantly different from
9")
that of 1 nm mdl 74156ef (1,,.,
_+ 2.5c2~; p 0.64).

3.2. electrophysiology
a 1-s pressure application of 5-ht induced an inward current which reached a maximum after about 1 s

the presence of 5-ht~ receptors in ng108-15 cells
has been deduced from radioligand binding studies
(hoyer and neijt, 1987) and voltage-clamp experiments

and this i n c r e a s e in basicity may allow for a s t r o n g e r

it is i n t e r e s t i n g to note that the c o n c e n t r a t i o n s
