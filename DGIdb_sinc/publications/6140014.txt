abstract-a
highly purified preparation of tetrahymena calmodulin activated a membrane-bound
 xxxg1587xxx  by more than 40-fold. this activation of  xxxg1587xxx  by calmodulin was inhibited
completely by local anesthetics such as  xxxd1869xxx , tetracaine, lidocaine and procaine at concentrations
that had no appreciable effect on the activities of basal  xxxg1587xxx  (without calmodulin) and
adenylate cyclase. the inhibition by  xxxd1869xxx  of calmodulin-mediated activation of the enzyme activity
was not reversed by calcium but was partially overcome by increasing the concentration of calmodulin.
kinetic analysis of local anesthetic-induced inhibition of activation of  xxxg1587xxx  demonstrated
a mixed type of antagonism. these results suggest the possibility that the inhibition of calmodulindependent  xxxg1587xxx  resulted, in part, from interaction of the drugs with calmodulin.
a ca”-dependent
regulatory
protein, calmodulin,
is present in a variety of eukaryotic organisms. first
described as a heat-stable
activator of  xxxg1696xxx 
[l, 21, the protein has since
been shown to modulate
the activity of diverse
enzymes and to mediate the regulatory
effects of
ca2+ on many biological processes [3-61.
in earlier reports, we described the calmodulin in
a ciliated protozoan,
tetrahymena pyriformis [7-91,
and demonstrated
that guanylate
cyclase
(ec
4.6.1.2.)) which is entirely associated with particulate
fractions, was activated by calmodulin in the presence of ca*+ [7,9-111. no other calmodulins
from
the various phyla investigated
thus far activated
tetrahymena guanylate
cyclase except the calmodulin from another ciliated protozoa,
paramecium
tetraurelia [ 121. the specific interaction
of guanylate
cyclase with tetrahymena calmodulin may reflect the
amino acid sequence of this calmodulin which displays eleven substitutions
and one deletion compared
with bovine brain calmodulin
[13].
local anesthetics have been shown to induce some
biological actions in protozoan
cells. these include
deciliation [14] and mucocyst discharge [15] in tetrahymena and reversal of the ciliary beating direction
in paramecium [ 161. despite the somewhat disparate
nature of the above phenomena,
all have in common
the involvement
of calcium. thus, it is possible that
calmodulin and calmodulin-dependent
enzymes may
be implicated in these calcium-mediated
phenomena
[17]. therefore,
we have investigated
the effects of
local anesthetics
such as  xxxd1869xxx , tetracaine,
lidocaine and procaine on calmodulin-dependent
guanyl&e cyclase of t. pyriformis in the hope of gaining

further insight into the physiological
role of calmodulin in this organism.
the results obtained from this study demonstrate
that the local anesthetics inhibited calmodulin-stimulated activity of membrane-bound
 xxxg1587xxx 
of tetrahymena at concentrations
which exerted little
effect on the basal  xxxg1587xxx  activity (without
calmodulin) and another membrane-bound
enzyme,
adenylate cyclase. they also suggest that the inhibition might have been due, in part, to a direct
interaction
of the drugs with calmodulin.

effect of substrate concentration on dibucaineinduced inhibition of  xxxg1587xxx . to exclude

the possibility of interaction between local anesthetics and substrate, the effect of  xxxd1869xxx  on
reaction velocity was examined as a function of gtp
concentration.
a lineweaver-burk
plot of initial
velocity versus gtp concentration for calmodulinstimulated  xxxg1587xxx  is shown in fig. 4. the
apparent k, of gtp for  xxxg1587xxx  in the
absence and presence of 0.3 mm  xxxd1869xxx  was not
altered and represented approximately 50 pm. thus,

1

activation of  xxxg1587xxx  by calmodulin was
almost completely abolished; on the other hand,
when ca2+ was present, the drug decreased the v,,,
for  xxxg1587xxx . increasing the calmoduiin concentration tended to reduce the dibu~aine-induced
inhibition of the enzyme activity but it did not restore
it to maximal activity. the maximal attainable activities of  xxxg1587xxx  in the presence of excess
calmodulin up to 5opg were approximately 77 and
52% of the control level with 0.15 and 0.3 mm
 xxxd1869xxx  respectively. to investigate further the
interactions among calmodulin,  xxxg1587xxx 
and  xxxd1869xxx ,
double-reciprocal
plots of the
 xxxg1587xxx  activity were graphed as a function
of calmodulin concentration.
figure 6 shows the
double-reciprocal plots of representative data in the
absence or presence of  xxxd1869xxx . the points at
which the lines cross the y axis represent the theoretical maximum velocity (v,,,,,) obtained in the presence of calmodulin. as can be seen, the v,,, value
for  xxxg1587xxx  decreased as the concentration
of  xxxd1869xxx  increased. on the other hand, the k,,,s
for calmodulin stimulation of  xxxg1587xxx  was
increased by the drug. these data indicate that this
inhibition of  xxxg1587xxx  activation by  xxxd1869xxx  was of a “mixed type”, suggesting that the
inhibition
of calmodulin-stimulated
guanylate
cyclase was due not only to a competitive antagonism
of calmodulin with  xxxd1869xxx  but also to another
mechanism
that was not reversible by excess
calmodulin.

discussion
it has been reported
recently that several drugs,
including
phenothiazines
and local anesthetics,
inhibit calmodulin-stimulated
activities
of (caz’mg?+)atpase.
 xxxg1696xxx ,
myosin light chain kinase, and membrane-bound
calcium transport
[23-261. we previously reported
that phenothiazine
antipsychotic
agents such as  xxxd3431xxx 
inhibited
the calmodulin-stimulated
 xxxg1587xxx  of tetrahymena and suggested that
these drugs selectively
prevent
ca”-dependent
activation
of  xxxg1587xxx  by competing
with
calmodulin
[27]. the present report demonstrates
that certain local anesthetics
( xxxd1869xxx ,
tetracaine,
lidocaine and procaine) exerted a strong inhibition
of  xxxg1587xxx  activation
induced by calmodulin in this ciliated organism.
the inhibition
of
calmodulin-dependent
 xxxg1587xxx  activity by
local anesthetics
was not completely
eliminated
by
the addition of excess calmodulin.
simple competitive antagonism
between calmodulin and these local
anesthetics
does not account entirelv for our observations of inhibition of calmodulin-stimulated
 xxxg1587xxx . in a recent report, volpi et al. [23]
anesthetics
demonstrated
that
local
inhibit
calmodulin-dependent
stimulation
of erythrocyte
ca” -atpase and  xxxg1696xxx  from brain and heart as well as the binding of
“‘i-labeled calmodulin to the erythrocyte
membrane
and suggested
that the enzyme
inhibition
was
mediated through direct binding of local anesthetics
on calmodulin.
however,
their results also demonstrated
that the inhibition
of membrane-bound
ca” -atpale
by local anesthetics
was partially
restored by the addition of excess calmodulin.
while
the inhibitory
action on soluble phospbodiesterase
was completely reversed by added calmoduiin. these
fmdings may provide an explanation
for the results
obtained here for the inhibition of membrane-bound
guanylate
cyclase which exhibited
a mixed-type
antagonism
against calmodulin.
that is, it may be
that the local anesthetics
affect stimulation
of
membrane-bound
enzymes by calmoduhn in a more

complex way than they affect stimulation of soluble
enzymes.
although
the molecular
mechanisms
responsible
for the effects of local anesthetics
on
calmodulin-stimulated
guanvlate
cyclase have not
been fully elucidated,
one of the factors that should
be considered
in explaining the effect\ of local antsthetics on the rnzymcs
ic the interaction
of local
anesthetics
with membrane
phospholipids
[jx].
indeed, in a previous paper-. \ve have shown that
 xxxd1869xxx 
increases
plasma memhrarrc
iiuidit\; of
tetru~z~~e~a as estimated
with 1,~-~i~pllen~i-l.3.5hexatrrene
(dph)
and also causes i~lhib~ti~~,l oi
atpase activity bound to this membrane
[‘_y]. 111
addition,
we have reported
that the acttvity of
membrane-bound
adcnylate cyclase of 7‘crrrr/z\~r~re,r~r
is dependent
on the physical state of plasma membrane [30]. as clearly shown in the present study.
adcnylate cyclase, which is unrelated to ~~~lnlo~~~~lill.
was also suppressed
by the local anesthetics
in ;t
dose-dependent
manner. therefore.
it is likely that
local anesthetics at relatively high concentration
may
have some effects on the immediate
lipid cnvil-orrment of adenylate oyclase and, thereby, alter their
conformation
and impair the enzyme activity. as
these possible interactions of local anesthetics cannot
be excluded.
the results on the antagonism
of
calmodulin-dependent
guanylatc
cyclase bv local
anesthetics have to be interpreted
with the limitation
that they may not be specific for calmodulin. further
studies on solubilized
enzymes
or reconstituted
enzymes with different lipid environments
may help
to resolve the molecular mechanisms
of the action
of local anesthetics
on membrane-bound
cnztmt’.
several local anesthetics
are known to affect ;i
wide range of ca”-dependent
processes.
such as
exocytosis [31], platelet aggregation [xl. memhranc
transport
of calcium 1331 and cell spreading
and
motility ([34]: for review see ret’ 35). we :tlso
observed that local anesthetics in~~ihit~d growth and
cal+ uptake of tetrnhynzenu ceils. the i(‘~, viliues
for cell growth were found to be lower than those
for both calmodulin-dependent
puanylate
cyclaat:
activity and ca’ ’ uptake. but the order of inhibitor\
potency of the anesthetics
against cell growth was
identical to that for c~lim[~duiin- xxxd2870xxx (~ent guanylatc
cyclase and ca” uptake ~.~lnpublishcd data). these
results suggest the possrbrlity that the inhibition of
growth by local anesthetics
may result from inhibition of  xxxg1587xxx  and also (~a.” uptake. hut
at the present time their relative contribution
is not
known. on the other hand, we previously reported
that both guanylate cyclasc activity ;ind c~~lrno~l~~li~~
content fluctuate durmg cell growth and cell cvcle
of tetrahymena and suggested that the change; in
guanylatecyclase
activity may reflect the intracellular
level of  xxxg322xxx %. 371. more recently. %wil!ct
et al. [3s] also suggested that the activation of  xxxg1587xxx  might play a role in the growth [)i
cultured
cells. ?ihesc data further
implicate
the
ca~modulil~-guarlyl~itc cyciase system in the gr-on’th
of tetraizymenu cellc. therefore,
although wt’ xi’c
aware that local anesthetics
may intcrfcrc with the
processes that are independent
of calmodulin
and.
thus lead to deteriorated
functions essential for cell
growth, it is tempting
to speculate that the ~fli~
