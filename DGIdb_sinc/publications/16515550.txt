abstract
the ubiquitous polyamines spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  are
known as modulators of glutamate receptors and inwardly
rectifying potassium channels. they are synthesized by a set
of specific enzymes in which spermidine synthase is the ratelimiting step catalysing the formation of the  xxxd3234xxx  precursor spermidine from putrescine. spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx 
were previously localized to astrocytes, probably reflecting
storage rather than synthesis in these cells. in order to identify
the cellular origin of spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  synthesis in the
brain, antibodies were raised against recombinant mouse
spermidine synthase. as expected, strong spermidine synthase-like immunoreactivity was obtained in regions known to
express high levels of spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx , such as
the hypothalamic paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. in the
striatum, spermidine synthase was found in neurones and the

polyamines are small organic polycationic effector molecules
that are synthesized by virtually all living organisms from
bacteria to plants and mammals, including man (tabor and
tabor 1984; galston and sawhney 1990). they serve a
variety of basic functions in cell division, proliferation,
differentiation and protein secretion (tabor and tabor 1964,
1984; janne et al. 1978, 1991; williams-ashman and
canellakis 1979; pegg 1986; slotkin and bartolome 1986;

the polyamines spermidine (spd) and  xxxd3234xxx  (spm) are
involved with speciﬁc functions in the mammalian nervous
system. spd/spm appear to affect neuronal excitability by

neuropil of the patch compartment (striosome) as defined by
expression of the l opiate receptor. the distinct expression
pattern of spermidine synthase, however, only partially overlapped with the distribution of the products spermidine and
 xxxd3234xxx  in the striatum. in addition, spermidine synthase-like
immunoreactivity was seen in patch compartment-apposed
putative interneurones. these spermidine synthase-positive
neurones did not express any marker characteristic of the
major striatal interneurone classes. the neuropil labelling in
the patch compartment and in adjacent putative interneurones
may indicate a role for polyamines in intercompartmental
signalling in the striatum.

spermidine synthase in striatal neurones 175

modulating the physiological properties of receptor ion
channels, namely nmda receptors (ransom and stec 1988;
williams et al. 1989; benveniste and mayer 1993), a-amino3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (ampa)/kainate
receptors (bowie and mayer 1995; donevan and rogawski
1995; isa et al. 1995; kamboj et al. 1995; koh et al. 1995)
and inwardly rectifying potassium channels (fakler et al.
1994, 1995; ficker et al. 1994; lopatin et al. 1994). spd and
spm interact with these ion channels by several mechanisms.
rectiﬁcation in ampa/kainate receptors and kir channels is
affected by intracellular low (nanomolar to micromolar)
concentrations of spd/spm. in contrast, nmda and kainate
receptors (mott et al. 2003) possess extracellular binding
sites requiring high (millimolar) amounts of spd/spm.
apparently both spd and spm exert similar effects on their
intracellular and extracellular targets. owing to the additional
positive charge, the potency of spm may be greater than that
of spd.
three separate binding sites on the nmda receptor allow
different modes of action (for review see williams 1997a,b).
depending on the extracellular levels of spd/spm, nmda
receptors are either positively modulated or blocked at low or
high concentrations respectively. positive modulation of the
nmda receptor may lead to enhanced ca2+ inﬂux. thus,
under pathological conditions extracellular spd/spm may
contribute to excitotoxicity. by contrast, intracellular spd/
spm have been reported to be involved in the pathology of
neurodegenerative diseases including huntington’s chorea
(colton et al. 2004) and parkinson’s disease (antony et al.
2003; goers et al. 2003).
in the rat, spd/spm have been localized to glial cells,
especially astrocytes (laube and veh 1997), and to several
types of neurone (fujiwara et al. 1997; laube and veh 1997;
laube et al. 2002; schreiber et al. 2004). the absence of
 xxxd2793xxx  carboxylase ( xxxg1626xxx ;  xxxg1626xxx , odc), which catalyses the formation of the spd/spm
precursor putrescine from ornithine, from astrocytes indicates
that spd/spm in astroglia are synthesized in neurones rather
than in glial cells. based on the known release and uptake of
polyamines (harman and shaw 1981; seiler et al. 1996;
sakata et al. 2000; masuko et al. 2003), it was tempting to
speculate about an interplay between neurones and glia
(laube and veh 1997). accordingly, spd/spm synthesized in
neurones may be released, possibly from vesicles (soulet
et al. 2002, 2004), and stored in astrocytes. subsequent
release from astrocytes may be induced by neural activity,
leading to glial  xxxg981xxx  activation.
the biosynthesis of polyamines is tightly controlled by a
distinct set of enzymes (williams-ashman et al. 1972),
namely odc, s-adenosylmethioninamine : putrescine 3aminopropyltransferase ( xxxg1735xxx .16; spermidine synthase,
spds) and s-adenosylmethioninamine : spermidine 3aminopropyltransferase ( xxxg1735xxx .22;  xxxg2181xxx ,
spms). in the brain, so far only odc has been immunocy-

tochemically localized, to several neuronal cell types and to
müller glia cells of the retina (cintra et al. 1987; dorn et al.
1987; junttila et al. 1993; biedermann et al. 1998; bernstein
and müller 1999; laube et al. 2002). putrescine, however,
may also be derived from arginine via an alternative pathway
involving cleavage of the intermediate metabolite  xxxd94xxx 
by agmatinase and release of urea. consequently, the lack
of odc in astrocytes does not necessarily preclude the
formation of polyamines in these cells. as spd/spm but not
putrescine were shown to modulate ion channel function, the
localization of the spd/spm biosynthetic enzymes may be
more important with respect to speciﬁc neuronal and glial
functions in distinct brain areas than the localization of odc.
it is currently not known whether spd is just the precursor
of spm or whether both polyamines serve distinct functions
in the brain. regarding the various and differential effects
of the two polyamines, a molecular differentiation between
spd and spm is required. so far, antibodies have failed to
differentiate between spd and spm (fujiwara et al. 1983;
laube and veh 1997). instead, the visualization of spd/spm
synthases may help to determine whether either one or both
of their products have cell-speciﬁc functions. thus, attention
might be drawn to those cell types that could be the major
source of local polyamine synthesis in areas which otherwise
exhibit either more uniform or even contrasting cellular
distribution of polyamines. the local enrichment of neurones
with spd/spm in certain brain areas and nuclei (fujiwara
et al. 1997; laube et al. 2002) points to additional, gliaindependent functions.
to identify the cells responsible for spd synthesis, we
raised and characterized a monospeciﬁc polyclonal antibody
against mouse spds, and used it to localize the enzyme in rat
forebrain sections. in the striatum, a clearly non-uniform
compartment-speciﬁc pattern of immunoreactivity points
to a putative role for spds in striatal networks. this striatal
network relies on two functionally and neurochemically
different areas, the patch and matrix compartment. because
the dendritic arbors of spiny projection neurones are
restricted to their respective compartments, interneurones
with processes crossing borders have been proposed to link
the two striatal compartments (cicchetti et al. 2000). with
respect to this integrative function, spds and hence spd and/
or spm may be important for the physiological as well as the
physiopathological function of the striatum.

materials and methods
construction of recombinant protein
at the amino acid level, rat and mouse spds show a high (about
96%) degree of homology (blast network service at swiss
institute of bioinformatics), suggesting a close immunochemical
similarity between the species. a proteomic fasta homology and
similarity search (mouse uniprot library at the european molecular

biology laboratory, european bioinformatics institute, heidelberg,
germany) revealed spms as the only mouse protein showing
homology with spds from this species. their amino acid sequence
identity, however, was only 28.5%, indicating that the two synthase
proteins could be immunologically discriminated. therefore, we
cloned the full-length open reading frame of mouse spds in a
bacterial expression system and used the pure recombinant histidine
(his)-tagged puriﬁed protein to immunize rabbits.
a mouse spds cdna clone (image id 3966710) was
purchased (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa). using restriction
site-tagged primers (forward primer 5¢-cgggatccgagcctggccccgacggcccag-3¢; reverse primer, 5¢-cgaattcaagcttcagcttatgtcattgagggcc-3¢) a pcr product of
905 bp, covering the complete open reading frame, was ampliﬁed
and in-frame subcloned into the pqe-30 vector (qiagen, valencia,
ca, usa) using bamhi and hindiii restriction sites. the accuracy
of the construct was veriﬁed by dna sequencing. from this
construct, a recombinant protein of 33 kda containing six aminoterminal his residues was expressed in escherichia coli host strain
m15[prep4]. a bacterial lysate was obtained by sonication. triton
x-100 was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 1% and the lysate was
then incubated on ice for 30 min before pelleting the cellular
debris. batch puriﬁcation of the fusion protein on nintasuperﬂow was then performed under native conditions, as
described by the manufacturer (qiagen). washing was performed
three times with lysis buffer containing 1% triton x-100, followed
by a ﬁnal wash with triton x-100-free lysis buffer. the fusion
protein was dialysed against phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and
used to immunize rabbits.
for puriﬁcation and control purposes a second spds recombinant
protein was constructed. the pcr product generated with the above
primers was subcloned into pgex2t (ge healthcare, uppsala,
sweden) via the bamhi and ecori restriction sites. from this
construct, a recombinant 60-kda glutathione-s-transferase (ec
2.5.1.18; gst) fusion protein was expressed and puriﬁed using
glutathione sepharose 4b afﬁnity matrix according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ge healthcare, uppsala, sweden). puriﬁed
recombinant protein was dialysed against 50 mm tris-hcl buffer,
ph 8.0.
preparation of rat tissue
for all procedures ethical approval was obtained in accordance with
the national act on the use of experimental animals (germany).
for immunocytochemistry, adult male wistar rats were deeply
anaesthesized using a mixture of ketavet (parke-davis pharmacia,
erlangen, germany) and domitor (pﬁzer, karlsruhe, germany). the
animals were then perfused transcardially with 0.9% nacl solution
for 1 min, followed by a ﬁxative composed of 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.05% glutaraldehyde and 0.2% picric acid for 20 min. for
immunoﬂuorescence, 4% paraformaldehyde only was used as
ﬁxative. brains were removed from the scull. the ventral lobes of
the prostate were dissected. tissues were rinsed extensively in 0.1 m
phosphate buffer, and freeze-protected with 1 m sucrose in 0.1 m
phosphate buffer. tissue was frozen at ) 60c in hexane and stored
frozen at ) 80c until use. for immunocytochemistry, a total of 12
rats and 508 frontal sections were analysed. immunocytochemical
double-labelling experiments were performed 3–5 times for each
combination of antigens. for the quantiﬁcation of striatal interneu-

rone markers, a rat brain was serially sectioned between the level of
the caudal part of the nucleus accumbens and the infundibular stem.
for western blotting, adult male wistar rats were anaesthesized
with halothane and killed by cervical dislocation. tissues were
rapidly dissected, cut into pieces on a cold metal plate at 0c,
transfered to homogenization buffer supplemented with protease
inhibitors (250 mm sucrose, 1 m imidazole, 1 m edta, 5 mm
sodium azide with 1 lg/ml aprotinin, 1 lg/ml pepstatin a, 1 lg/
ml leupeptin, 1 lg/ml phenylmethylsulphonyl ﬂuoride) and
homogenized with a supersonic homogenizator (bandelin uw70,
berlin, germany). the homogenates were centrifuged at 4c for
10 min at 1200 g. the supernatants were collected and protein
concentration was determined by a bicinchoninic acid assay. a total
of four rat brains and prostates, separately treated, was used for
spds, and three rat brains for l-arginine, nadph : oxygen
oxidoreductase (ec 1.14.13.39; neuronal  xxxd2738xxx  synthase,
 xxxg1577xxx ) western blotting experiments. speciﬁc labelling for spds
and  xxxg1577xxx  was reproduced eight and six times respectively.
antibodies
all antibodies used in this study are summarized in table 1. the
speciﬁcity of commercial marker antibodies and the anti-spd/spm
antibody has been described previously (see references in table 1).
generation of monospecific affinity-purified antibodies
the generation, puriﬁcation and characterization of the monospeciﬁc antibody against spds was performed as described previously
for bacterially expressed antigens (veh et al. 1995). brieﬂy, rabbits
were immunized with the puriﬁed, his-tagged recombinant spds
protein. the activity of the crude serum was tested against
the fusion proteins spds-his, spds-gst, spm-his, and his-tagged  xxxd3334xxx  : nadp+ oxidoreductase (ec 1.5.1.3;
 xxxg631xxx , dhfr)-his. the serum dilution optimal
for afﬁnity puriﬁcation was determined by elisa. puriﬁcation was
performed in a three-step procedure. nitrocellulose membranes
were loaded with the cognate antigen spms-his for removal of
potential cross-reactivities for 2 h at room temperature (25c).
cross-reactivities against bacterial protein were removed by batch
adsorption (800 mg wet pellet/60 ml membrane supernatant) for
1 h at room temperature (pompeia et al. 1996), followed by
afﬁnity absorption on spds-gst-loaded (10 lg/ml in pbs)
membranes. generally, the different membranes were rinsed three
times in pbs and blocked with 5% normal goat serum (nds) for
1 h at room termpature after loading proteins. for afﬁnity
puriﬁcation, the membranes were incubated with antiserum diluted
1 : 1000 in 5% ngs in pbs overnight at 4c. after washing,
bound antibodies were eluted with 200 mm glycine-hcl, ph 2.5,
supplemented with 0.9% nacl and 0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx 
(bsa) for 30 min at toom temperature. eluted antibodies were
subsequently dialysed against pbs and 20 mm phosphate buffer,
ph 6.0, at 4c. the dialysed antibody was then loaded on a
sp-sepharose fast-ﬂow column at 4c. bound antibodies were
eluted with 200 mm carbonate buffer, ph 9.0, pooled and then
again dialysed against pbs. the concentrated afﬁnity-puriﬁed
antibody was aliquoted and stored frozen. activity was determined
by indirect and competitive elisa assays (fig. 1).
for double-labelling of spds with  xxxg1577xxx , an anti-peptide
antibody was raised in goat. the sequence fieeskkdadevfss,

corresponding to amino acids 1417–1429 at the c-terminus,
previously successfully used to immunize rabbits, was selected in
order to obtain a pan- xxxg1577xxx  antibody recognizing all three isoforms.
the corresponding c-terminal peptide was synthesized, conjugated
to bsa with glutaraldehyde, and used for immunization. crude
serum activity was monitored by elisa. for this purpose, synthetic
peptides were coupled to ovalbumin instead of bsa. crude sera
were decomplemented for 30 min at 56c, and tested against their
native antigens and control conjugates. blood samples displaying
the highest antibody titres were used for afﬁnity puriﬁcation.
antibodies were afﬁnity puriﬁed against the corresponding recombinant partial  xxxg1577xxx  sequence as above. to generate a c-terminal
partial fusion protein, a restriction fragment was prepared from rat
 xxxg1577xxx  cdna (kindly provided by dr s. snyder, johns hopkins
medical school, baltimore, md, usa) using the hindiii site at bp
4111 and bamhi at bp 4640. the fragment encoding the last 173
amino acids of  xxxg1577xxx  was subcloned in-frame into pgheb. this
construct was expressed as a recombinant protein of 45 kda

containing the  xxxg1577xxx  c-terminal sequence fused to gst. two well
characterized commercial antibodies against  xxxg1577xxx , optimized for
western blotting (n31020, raised in mouse; bd transduction,
heidelberg, germany) (bredt et al. 1991; brenman et al. 1995) and
immunocytochemistry (alexis 210–501, raised in rabbit (alexis
cooperation, lausen, switzerland) (kummer et al. 1992), were used
as references for the characterization of our new goat-anti- xxxg1577xxx

immunocytochemistry
immunoperoxidase
immunocytochemical labelling for spd/spm and the l opiate
receptor 1b (or-610, raised in rabbit; gramsch laboratories,
schwabhausen, germany) (schulz et al. 1998) was performed
according to standard dab/nickel immunoperoxidase protocols
(straus 1982; trojanowski et al. 1983; veh et al. 1995). freeﬂoating sections were treated with 1% sodium borohydride in pbs
for 15 min, washed with pbs, and incubated in a solution
containing 10% ngs, 0.3% triton x-100 and 0.05% phenylhydrazine in pbs for 30 min. primary antibody was diluted in 10% ngs
and 0.3% triton x-100 supplemented with 0.1% sodium azide and
0.01% thimerosal, and incubated for 36 h at 8c. after washing for
1 h in pbs and another hour in pbs containing 0.2% bsa (pbs–
bsa), the sections were either incubated in biotinylated secondary

(both 1 : 2000 in pbs–bsa; vector, burlingame, ca, usa) for
24 h at 8c. the sections were again washed as described above and
further incubated for 6 h with an avidin–biotinyl–peroxidase
complex (abc) (elite abc kit; vector) in pbs–bsa. after the
ﬁnal wash, bound peroxidase was visualized in a solution containing
1.4 mm dab, 10 mm imidazole, 6.6 mm nickel ammonium sulphate, and 0.15% h2o2 in 50 mm tris/hcl buffer, ph 7.4. all
sections were developed for 15 min. labelled sections were
mounted, dehydrated and cover-slipped with entellan, merck,
darmstadt, germany.
immunoﬂuorescence
the incubation protocol used for immunoﬂuorescence labelling of
rat brain tissue was identical to the immunoperoxidase protocol
except that phenylhydrazine was omitted. normal donkey serum
was used instead of ngs as blocking reagent for the goat anti- xxxg1577xxx 
and goat anti-calretinin antibody. secondary antibodies used were
goat anti-rabbit alexafluor 488 and 594, goat anti-mouse alexafluor 594, goat anti-guinea pig alexafluor 488 and donkey antigoat alexafluor 488. alternatively, streptavidin alexafluor 594
was used with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit (all from molecular
probes, eugene, or, usa). labelled sections were mounted,
dehydrated, and cover-slipped with xylene, di-n-butyl-phthalate,
polystyrene dpx (fluka, buchs, switzerland).
for controls, either primary or secondary antibodies were
omitted. no staining was detected under these conditions. to

characterization of affinity-purified anti-spds raised against bacterially
expressed his-tagged spds protein in a competitive elisa. an
appropriate dilution (1 : 500) of anti-spds was preincubated with
increasing concentrations of spds-gst protein, his-tagged dhfr
(dhfr-his) and his tagged spms (spms-his). half-maximal inhibition was observed at 0.1 lg/ml spds-gst and near-complete inhibition at 20 lg/ml. in contrast, spms-his and dhfr-his at increasing
concentrations did not show any effect. (b) induction of bacterially
expressed spds-gst and spds-his was monitored on ponceaustained nitrocellulose blots of induced versus non-induced bacterial

of 60 kda, resulting from the molecular weights of spds (35 kda) and
the recombinant spds-gst protein (25 kda). in contrast, spds-his
was displayed at  35 kda. (c) labelling of the blot shown in (b) with
anti-spds revealed two major bands at the respective molecular
weights of spds-gst and spds-his in induced bacteria. much weaker
bands were detected at the relevant molecular weights in non-induced
bacteria. all other minor bands were also detected with lysates from
control experiments (not shown) using spm-expressing bacteria.

detected at 35 kda, the calculated molecular weight of rat spds. as
expected, the protein was most strongly expressed in the prostate but
was also clearly present in the hypothalamus. (e) spds-transfected

(invitrogen) using the xbai and xhoi sites of the parental bluescript
sk(–) vector, yielding nnosa-vec. hek293 cells were grown in
dulbecco’s modiﬁed eagle’s medium (gibco, rockville, md, usa)
supplemented with 10% fetal bsa (paa laboratories), penicillin/

and transfected with nnosa-vec or an empty control vector pcmv/
myc/cyto (control-vec) using polyfect transfection reagent (qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
quantification of spds and interneurone marker labelling
serial frontal sections of anterior, medial and caudal parts of the
striatum were consecutively labelled for spds,  xxxg1577xxx , calretinin,
 xxxg1901xxx , calbindin, chat and ppnpy. a total of six sections
(three sections each from two animals) was analysed for each
antigen in order to quantify spds in relation to striatal interneurone
subpopulations. for maximum sensitivity and stability of the
detection system we used the abc/dab method to visualize the
antigens. for calbindin labelling, only those cells displaying typical
interneurone morphology and more intensely labelled than medium
spiny neurones were included. similarly, for spds labelling, in
addition to matrix interneurones, only those neurones inside the
patches were counted, which matched morphological criteria for
interneurones.

results

characterization of antibodies
we aimed to develop a spds-speciﬁc antibody in order to
investigate the origin of spd and spm in rodent brain. amino
acid sequence analysis of spds indicated the possibility of
raising speciﬁc antibodies. the rabbit antiserum was crossabsorbed with spms protein, afﬁnity puriﬁed and monitored
by elisa assay (fig. 1a). activity of the afﬁnity-puriﬁed
anti-spds was almost completely inhibited by a spds-gst
construct in a competitive elisa assay, whereas spms-his
and dhfr-his showed no effect. thus the antibody did not
cross-react with either the related protein spms or with the
his tag used for puriﬁcation.
to further characterize the afﬁnity-puriﬁed anti-spds,
immunochemical activity against bacterial recombinant proteins and rat tissue homogenates was analysed by western
blotting. with lysates of bacteria overexpressing either spdshis or spds-gst (fig. 1b), the speciﬁcity of the antibody for
the corresponding antigen was demonstrated (fig. 1c). predominant bands were observed at 35 kda (spds-his), the
expected molecular weight of spds, and 60 kda (spds-gst),
the expected molecular weight of the spds-gst fusion
protein. by contrast, lysates from non-induced bacteria
showed weak bands at the expected molecular weights. the
45-kda spms bacterial fusion protein (spms-his) yielded no
immunosignal at the relevant molecular weight (not shown).
thus, the spds antibody did not cross-react with the distantly
related spms protein on western blots.

the prostate is known to contain high amounts of
polyamines, so prostate homogenate was used as a control
in western blotting experiments (fig. 1d). a single prominent band at 35 kda was detected. in the hypothalamus, a
protein of identical molecular weight was clearly present, but
expressed at a lower level. immunocytochemistry with
transfected cho cells (fig. 1e) conﬁrmed that the anti-spds
antibody reacted with the aldehyde-ﬁxed antigen in situ,
whereas no immunoreaction was observed in non-transfected
cho cells (fig. 1f).
as polyamines are known to be highly expressed in
peptide- and protein-secreting cells (tabor and tabor 1964),
the prostate (hougaard 1992) and the hypothalamic neurosecretory nuclei (fujiwara et al. 1997; laube et al. 2002) are
suitable as positive controls for immunocytochemical spds
labelling experiments and hence speciﬁcity. in the prostate,
spds-expressing cells were detected in the cytoplasm of
tubular epithelial cells (fig. 2a), and spd/spm were also
prominent at the luminal border of the tubules (fig. 2b) and
in the secretory content inside the lumen. robust immunoreactivity indicated the presence of both spds (figs 2c and
d) and spd/spm (fig. 2e) in neurosecretory neurones of the
supraoptic and paraventricular nucleus. taken together, these
results show that the anti-spds antibody speciﬁcally detects
spds in western blots of brain tissue and brain sections
analysed immunocytochemically.
spds in rat forebrain
next, we investigated the distribution of spds in the rat
forebrain. in contrast to our previous results that demonstrated a robust spd/spm-like immunoreactivity in astrocytes,
spds-like immunoreactivity was most prominently expressed
in distinct populations of neurones and in neuropil areas. the
selectivity of neuronal labelling was especially evident in the
striatum (fig. 3), displaying a highly segregated pattern with
respect to neurone versus neuropil labelling. neuropil
labelling was most pronounced in the indusium griseum
(not shown), the lateral septum and the hypothalamus
(fig. 3a). most obviously, a patch-like pattern of immunostaining was observed in the caudate–putamen. because this
pattern closely resembled the striatal patch compartment as
visualized by markers such the l opiate receptor, we stained
adjacent sections for either the l opiate receptor (figs 3b, c
and e) or spds (figs 3a, d and f). the l opiate receptor
labelling was conﬁned to patch-like neuropil areas in the
caudate–putamen and the area directly facing the external
capsule. in parallel sections, spds labelling clearly showed
the same patch-like pattern of immunoreactivity (arrows in
figs 3a and b), indicating a speciﬁc expression of spds in
the patch compartment. comparison of individual patches at
higher magniﬁcation (figs 3e and f) clearly demonstrated the
identity of l opiate receptor- and spds-labelled patches. in
contrast to the l opiate receptor-positive neuropil patches,
spds was not only detected in the neuropil but also in

neurones of the patch compartment (figs 3h–j). here, most
labelled cells displayed a medium spiny projection neuronelike morphology based on the shape and size of somata and
cell density (kawaguchi 1993). furthermore, none of the

striatal interneurone subpopulations showed similar aggregations of neurones (kubota and kawaguchi 1993). when
comparing the patterns of immunoreactivity obtained with
anti-l opiate receptor (fig. 3b) and anti-spds (fig. 3a), it
became evident that spds, in addition to the dorso-lateral
caudate–putamen, also displayed a prominent patch-like
pattern at the striato-pallidal border, with patches protruding
into the pallidal area. here, in contrast, l opiate receptor
labelling was either weak or absent. however, from
comparison with parallel sections labelled for  xxxg1577xxx , which
displayed a dense  xxxg1577xxx -positive ﬁbre system in the putamen
but not in the pallidum (not shown), it appears likely that
spds-labelled patches in the lateral pallidal area represent
striatal rather than pallidal tissue.
in the striatal matrix compartment, spds was strongly
expressed in scattered neurones putatively representing
interneurones (fig. 3g). some of these cells were observed
in close proximity to patch areas (figs 3h–j) and individual

processes could be followed that travelled towards the patch
areas (fig. 3i). occasionally, cells displaying interneuronelike morphology with elongated cell bodies larger than
average medium spiny neurones were observed in spdspositive patch areas. interneurones from all major striatal
subpopulations were localized to the matrix as well as the
patch compartment (kubota and kawaguchi 1993; kawaguchi et al. 1995; rymar et al. 2004).
to characterize the spds-positive putative interneurones,
double-immunoﬂuorescence labelling for  xxxg1577xxx , ppnpy,
 xxxg1901xxx , calbindin d28k, calretinin and chat was
performed. calbindin is known as a marker for medium
spiny projection neurones and the striatal matrix (gerfen
et al. 1985), but it is also expressed in a subpopulation of
striatal interneurones (bennett and bolam 1993a). because
there was no commercially available anti- xxxg1577xxx  antibody
suitable for double-labelling with rabbit antibodies, we raised
an antibody in goat using a c-terminal peptide common to all

splice isoforms of  xxxg1577xxx . the speciﬁcity of our new
afﬁnity-puriﬁed pan- xxxg1577xxx  antibody raised in goat was
shown on immunoblots from rat cerebellar homogenate and
recombinant nnosa (fig. 4a). the antibody clearly detected

a single band at 160 kda in both samples, identical to the
bands obtained when using a reference antibody (bd
transduction). antibody speciﬁcity was further conﬁrmed
with immunocytochemistry on hek293 cells (figs 4b and
c). hek cells transfected with nnosa were speciﬁcally
labelled (fig. 4b), as conﬁrmed with a reference antibody
(alexis, not shown), whereas cells transfected with an empty
vector were not labelled (fig. 4c). in sections of cerebral
cortex an identical labelling pattern was obtained with our
goat anti-pan- xxxg1577xxx  (fig. 4f) and commercially available
anti-pan- xxxg1577xxx  antibodies raised in rabbit (figs 4d and e).
taken together, these data show that the goat anti- xxxg1577xxx 
antibody speciﬁcally detects  xxxg1577xxx  in western blotting and

fig. 5 expression of  xxxg1577xxx  and npy in striatal interneurones. in order
to test for subpopulations within the  xxxg1577xxx /npy interneurone group,
double-labelling experiments were performed. in some cells, either
 xxxg1577xxx  (a, arrow) or ppnpy (d, arrow) only were detected. other cells

groups. additionally, the rare calbindin d28k interneurones

(table 2). similar results were obtained for two animals.
accordingly, the populations of spds- and  xxxg1577xxx -expressing
cells were the largest, and were of a similar size, followed by
the relatively abundant  xxxg1901xxx - and chat-expressing
cells. calretinin- and ppnpy-expressing cells represented
smaller populations, of about one-third the size of the
spds-positive population. in both animals, a rostral-tocaudal decrease in calretinin-expressing interneurones was
observed, as reported previously (bennett and bolam
1993b). finally, calbindin-positive interneurones were less
numerous, as expected. however, the number of calbindin
interneurones may actually be even smaller owing to the
simultaneous labelling of numerous medium spiny matrix
neurones in these sections.
discussion

previous localization studies have demonstrated that, despite
their ubiquitous occurence, in the mammalian brain the
immunocytochemically indistinguishable polyamines spd
and/or spm are differentially distributed to distinctive sets
of brain cells in a non-homogeneous manner (fujiwara et al.
1997; laube and veh 1997; laube et al. 2002). a selective
distribution has also been reported for odc, which synthesizes the spd/spm precursor putrescine (cintra et al. 1987;
junttila et al. 1993; bernstein and müller 1999; kilpelainen
et al. 2000). the most striking difference between spd/spm
and odc localization was found in astrocytes. these cells
robustly display spd/spm-like immunoreactivity throughout
the brain (laube and veh 1997) but lack detectable levels of
odc. although the molecular nature of mammalian polyamine transporters is currently unknown, polyamine uptake
and release have been well documented (harman and shaw
1981; grillo and colombatto 1994; seiler et al. 1996; dot
et al. 2000; sakata et al. 2000; masuko et al. 2003). recent
biochemical data indicate that polyamine uptake occurs via

955
5766

plasma membrane transporters, with subsequent storage in
pre-existing polyamine-sequestering vesicles (soulet et al.
2004).
a redistribution of polyamines away from the site of
synthesis might obscur the cellular origin of spd/spm in the
brain. in this respect, odc expression data are of limited
value, as putrescine itself does not exhibit the brain-speciﬁc
functions described for spd/spm. as an spd precursor,
however, putrescine may also be provided via the alternative
 xxxd94xxx  pathway. the localization of the two spd/spm
synthases might thus provide important additional information about the potential sources of spd/spm in certain cell
types and brain areas. our data demonstrate a differential
expression of spds in the striatum and support this view.
in previous studies, neither spd/spm nor odc immunocytochemistry revealed distinct labelling of the striatal patch
compartment. with anti-spd/spm antibodies, in the caudate–
putamen, in addition to astrocytes and neuropil, scattered
neurones possibly representing interneurones displayed considerably strong immunoreactivity (laube et al. 2002). the
reliability of the immunocytochemical labelling for spds in
the striatum was veriﬁed by labelling the prostate gland and
hypothalamic neurosecretory nuclei as positive controls
(fig. 2). we have used various techniques, i.e. elisa,
western blotting and immunocytochemistry of different
tissues and cells, to characterize our new anti-spds antibody,
and have demonstrated the speciﬁcity of the antibody with
respect to target recognition with the relevant techniques.
the surprisingly prominent localization of spds in the
striatum suggests a functional role for spds in striatal patch/
matrix circuitry. in contrast to other markers of the patch
compartment (graybiel 1990; gerfen 1992), spds was
localized to neurones and neuropil of the patch compartment,
possibly indicating different sources for spd/spm in this
compartment. a bifunctional role of spd/spm in the striatum

clusters of neuronal cell bodies in the patch compartment
(laube et al. 2002). by contrast, scattered putative interneurones were clearly evident. a previously proposed model
(laube and veh 1997), involving synthesis of spd/spm in
neurones, release, uptake and storage in astrocytes, and
release from astrocytes in order to modulate nmda receptor
function via extracellular binding sites, could account for the
differences in spds and spd/spm labelling.
recent data from behavioural experiments support this
model of extracellular spd/spm modulating nmda-receptor-mediated events involved with amygdala fear conditioning (rubin et al. 2004), and improved performance in
learning and memory tasks after administration of spd in
amygdala and hippocampus (rubin et al. 2000, 2001;
berlese et al. 2005). a putative release of spd/spm from
astrocytic processes ensheathing synaptic contacts might
provide a general mechanism for nmda receptor regulation
via extracellular polyamine-binding sites. however, the
prominent localization of spds in neurones of the patch
compartment in contrast to the surrounding matrix compartment may point to roles of spd and/or spm in the two striatal
compartments that are different from those of the aforementioned model. in the striatal matrix both spds and spd/spm
were localized to putative interneurones. however, spdscontaining putative matrix interneurones could not be
classiﬁed as belonging to one of the major striatal interneurone classes. thus, the observed scattered spds-positive
matrix neurones could either represent a new class of striatal
interneurones or might even – at least partially – belong to a
subpopulation of projection neurones. the morphology and
scattered distribution of spds-positive matrix cells argue in
favour of putative interneurones. this assumption may also
be supported by the ﬁndings that the size of spds-nnosand  xxxg1901xxx  expressing cell populations was similar
(table 2). a subpopulation of matrix neurones containing the
gabaa  xxxg81xxx  subunit but lacking all major interneurone markers has been described (waldvogel et al. 1997).
these cells were also immunonegative for the medium spiny
neurone markers  xxxg2240xxx  and enkephalin. furthermore,
waldvogel et al. described a distribution of these cells
similar to that of spds-positive scattered matrix neurones,
some of which were observed at the interface of the matrix
and patch compartment with their dendrites extending into
both compartments. ultrastructural characterization of spdslabelled matrix neurones and double-labelling experiments
with enkephalin and  xxxg2240xxx , markers for the two main
populations of medium spiny projection neurones, and the
gabaa  xxxg81xxx  subunit may help to elucidate the nature
of these neurones in the future.
it has been suggested previously that only interneurones
could account for intercompartmental signalling between
striosomes and striatal matrix because the dendritic trees of
projection neurones are conﬁned to their relevant compartments (mitchell et al. 1999). as spds-positive matrix

neurones (as shown in figs 3h and i) may fulﬁl these
criteria, with processes travelling towards the patch compartment, they may be able to account for such intercompartmental signalling.
recent biochemical data have suggested the involvement
of spd/spm in the pathology of parkinson’s disease (antony
et al. 2003; goers et al. 2003) and huntington’s disease
(colton et al. 2004). in the striatum, the vulnerability of
individual neurones to a variety of insults strongly depends
on the cell type (mitchell et al. 1999). in huntington’s
disease, the selective degeneration of medium spiny projection neurones begins in the striosomes and spreads to the
striatal matrix (hedreen and folstein 1995). some types
of interneurone remain largely unaffected during the course
of the disease (ellison et al. 1987). the selective loss of
medium spiny neurones was explained by a mechanism of
glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity (petersen et al. 1999;
sieradzan and mann 2001). both,  xxxd2738xxx  and polyamines are known to promote nmda receptor-mediated
excitotoxicity (lombardi et al. 1993; ayata et al. 1997;
eliasson et al. 1999; sattler et al. 1999). interestingly,
several compounds protective against excitotoxicity act
antagonistically at extracellular polyamine-binding sites of
the nmda receptor (carter et al. 1990; zeevalk and nicklas
1990). given that spd/spm positively modulate nmda
receptors via these extracellular binding sites (williams et al.
1991; benveniste and mayer 1993; rock and macdonald
1995), it is tempting to speculate about a simultaneous
involvement of  xxxd2738xxx  and polyamines leading to an
increased ca2+ inﬂux through nmda receptors under
pathological conditions. nmda-induced excitotoxicity produced an early increase in odc activity and putrescine
concentration, and administration of exogenous putrescine
increased spm levels and reversed the neuroprotective effect
of odc inhibition (trout et al. 1993). accordingly, an
increase in the activity of the otherwise rate-limiting odc
could be extremely effective in cells already expressing high
levels of the downstream enzymes spds and spms. thus,
excessive spd/spm production in the striatal patch compartment and in spds-containing matrix neurons could lead to
excitotoxicity in vulnerable projection neurons. by contrast,
the neuroprotective activity of spm at relatively high (1 mm)
extracellular concentrations has been demonstrated in hippocampal slices (ferchmin et al. 2000). high extracellular
spm concentrations are known to block nmda receptors
and would therefore reduce the danger of excitotoxic injury.
the seemingly contradictory ﬁndings of neurotoxic versus
neuroprotective activities of spd/spm may be explained by
concentration-dependent effects as described for the nmda
receptor, ranging from positive modulation at lower spd/spm
concentrations to complete channel blockade at high concentrations. in addition, the biochemical pathways of nitric
oxide and polyamine synthesis may be regulated by competition for the common precursor arginine (colton et al.

2004). a shift in the balance between the two pathways may
account for the in vitro effects of up-regulated spd/spm
synthesis observed in neurodegenerative polyglutaminemediated aggregation characteristic of huntington’s disease
(colton et al. 2004). here, spd/spm promoted the aggregation of  xxxd2212xxx  domains, an effect similar to spd/spm
promoting the aggregation of a-synuclein in parkinson’s
disease (antony et al. 2003; goers et al. 2003). the role of
spd/spm in excitotoxicity is likely to depend on actual
intracellular and extracellular concentrations of free spd/
spm, which are not presently known. the physiological and
physiopathological functions of spd/spm in the brain
elucidated so far indicate similar roles for both polyamines.
however, because the localization of spms is presently not
known, different scenarios might be imagined. neurones
only expressing spds may lead to increased extracellular spd
levels in the vicinity of cell bodies and processes, thus using
spd but not spm to achieve effects. in contrast, neurones
expressing both spds and spms may produce spd and spm
at varying concentrations, depending on the activity of each
enzyme. in this case, however, cells are likely to preferentially exert spm effects. finally, neurones may contain spds
only and spm might be synthesized in glial cells, preferentially astrocytes, after uptake of neuronal spd. a detailed
comparison of the localization patterns of spds with those of
spms, which have yet to be characterized, will help to
develop a more precise picture of the complex actions of spd
and spm in the brain.
