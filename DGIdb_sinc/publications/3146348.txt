abstract: the activation of human [glu'] plasminogen ([glu'] pg) by human recombinant (rec) two-chain

tissue plasminogen activator ( xxxg1766xxx ) is inhibited by c1-, a t physiological concentrations, and stimulated by
t- xxxd146xxx  ( xxxd146xxx ), as well as fibrin( xxxd2046xxx ). chloride functions as a result of its binding to [glu'ipg,
with a kiof approximately 9.0 mm, thereby rendering [glu'ipg a less effective substrate for two-chain
rec- xxxg1766xxx .  xxxd146xxx  stimulates the activation in cl--containing solutions, with a k, of approximately 4.0 mm,
primarily by reversal of the c1--inhibitory effect. fibrinogen appears to exert its stimulatory properties
mainly through effects on the enzyme, two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx , with a k, of approximately 3.7 p m in activation
systems containing physiological levels of c1-. analysis of the results of this paper reveals that normal plasma
components, c1- and fibrinogen, exert major regulatory roles on the ability of [glu'ipg to be activated by
two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx , in in vitro systems. the presence of c1- inhibits the stimulation of [glu'ipg activation
that would normally occur in the presence of fibrinogen, a result of possible importance to the observation
that some degree of systemic fibrinogenolysis accompanies therapeutic use of tissue plasminogen activator.

h u m a n plasminogen ([glu'ipg), the precursor of the fibrinogenolytic and fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin, is a singlechain plasma glycoprotein containing 791 amino acids in
known sequence (wiman, 1973, 1977; sottrup-jensen et al.,
1977; malinowski et al., 1984; forsgren et al., 1987). activation of [glu'ipg is concomitant with cleavage of the
args61-vals6*peptide bond in the zymogen and is catalyzed
by a variety of proteins, such as urokinase ( xxxg1767xxx ), streptokinase (sk), and tissue plasminogen activator ( xxxg1766xxx ) [for a

as synthesized,  xxxg1766xxx  is a single-chain protein containing
527 amino acid residues (pennica et al., 1983). this protein
is also found in a two-chain form, as a result of cleavage of
the arg27s-ile276peptide bond by plasmin (pennica et al.,
1983) and other such enzymes (ichinose et al., 1984).  xxxg1766xxx 
is a  xxxg745xxx , containing the catalytic triad at sequence
positions his322(pennica et al., 1983), asp371(pennica et al.,
1983), and ser478(pennica et al., 1983; pohl et al, 1984). the
single-chain form of  xxxg1766xxx  is less active than the twechain form
toward small substrates (wallen et al., 1982), but apparently,
both forms of this enzyme possess similar plasminogen activator activities (rijken et al., 1982). whereas  xxxg1766xxx  is a poor
activator of plasminogen in the absence of certain effector
molecules, its activity is greatly stimulated in the presence of

activation of plasminogen by tpa

fibrin (hoylaerts et al., 1982) and cyanogen bromide fragments of fibrinogen (cnbr-fg) (nieuwenhuizen et al., 1983).
the different functions of  xxxg1766xxx  have been assigned to domain
regions present within its molecular structure, with fibrin
binding properties believed to exist within its “finger” domain
(banyai et al., 1983; mattler et al., 1985; zonneveld et al.,
1986), composing residues 1-43 (banyai et al., 1983), and its
“kringle” 2 region (zonneveld et al., 1986), consisting of
residues 180-261 (pennica et al., 1983). the protease portion
of the molecule is contained within residues 276-527 (pennica
et al., 1983). other domains with hereto uncertain functions
are the growth factor region, consisting of residues 44-9 1
(banyai et al., 1983), and the “kringle” 1 portion, containing
residues 92-173 (pennica et al., 1983).
we have shown previously that the activation of [glu’ipg
by sk (chibber et al., 1985, 1986),  xxxg1767xxx  (urano et al.,
1987a,b), and  xxxg1766xxx  (castellino et al., 1988) is inhibited by
physiological levels of cl-. we believe it important to establish
the relationship between inhibition by this anion and stimulation by positive effectors, in order that the physiological
relevance of normal plasma components toward activation of
[glu’ipg by  xxxg1766xxx  can be more fully understood. this information may be of value in consideration of the efficacy of
 xxxg1766xxx  as a clinical agent for clot dissolution.
materials
and methods
proteins. affinity chromatography forms 1 and 2 of
[glu’ipg were purified by our previously described modification (brockway et al., 1972) of the deutsch and mertz
( 1970) affinity chromatography technique. the lyophilized
protein was dissolved in a buffer consisting of 10 mm 4-(2hydroxyethy1)-1-piperazineethanesulfonicacid (hepes)naoh, ph 7.4, and exhaustively dialyzed against that same
buffer. for determination of the concentrations of [glu’ipg,
an t (l%, 1 cm, 280 nm) of 17.0 and a molecular mass of 94
kda per mole were employed (violand & castellino, 1976).
affinity form 1 was employed for the investigations described
herein.
recombinant (rec) single-chain  xxxg1766xxx  was a gift of genentech, inc., south san francisco, ca. the protein obtained
was approximately 7 0 4 0 % in the one-chain form. the material was reconstituted in 50 ml of water and converted to
the two-chain form with sepharose-plasmin, at a 1o:l
(mol/mol) ratio of single-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx  to plasmin. pilot gel
studies, on nadodso,/page under reducing conditions, were
employed to evaluate the most suitable reaction conditions,
which were approximately 1 h at room temperature. the
concentration of active two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx  in the stock solution
was determined by spectrofluorometric titration with 4methylumbelliferyl p-guanidinobenzoate (mugb) at 4 oc,
as we have described (urano et al., 1988).
a genetic variant of  xxxg1766xxx  ( c y s ~ ~ ,gly) was provided by
the monsanto co. this protein was converted to the two-chain
form and titrated, as above. the strategy behind the use of
this mutant is that the two chains are no longer covalently
coupled due to replacement of the cys residue from the heavy
chain that is involved in the covalent binding between the
component  xxxg1766xxx  polypeptide chains.
human fibrinogen was a product of  xxxd1866xxx , stockholm,
sweden. the material was reconstituted with water according
to the directions of the manufacturer and percolated through
the column of sepharose-lysine to remove plasminogen and
plasmin. a stock solution was prepared by dialysis against
a buffer containing 10 mm hepes-naoh, ph 7.4. analysis
of the material by nadodso,/page gels, under reducing
conditions, revealed an intact a-chain, as well as the expected

cnbr-fg was prepared by digestion of fibrinogen (10
mg/ml) with cnbr (100-fold molar excess over the methionine content of fibrinogen) in a solution of 70%  xxxd2154xxx .
the reaction was allowed to occur for 17 h at 25 oc, under
a n2 atmosphere, after which the solution was dialyzed against
water.
in order to prepare soluble fibrin, fibrinogen, at a concentration of 5.5 mg/ml, was first dialyzed against a buffer
consisting of 10 mm hepes-naoh, ph 7.4. after this, a total
of 2.5 international units of ancrod (international reference
preparation 74/581) was added, and the solution was incubated at 37 oc for 2 h. the clot was removed, washed extensively with 10 mm hepes-naoh, ph 7.4, and solubilized
by addition of a measured volume of 5.7 m urea. this was
employed as the stock solution.
[glu’] pg activation assays. continuous coupled assays
for evaluating the activation rate of [glu’]pg under differing
conditions of c1- and protein promoter concentrations were
based upon the temporal development of amidolytic activity
of the plasmin that is generated as a result of the activation
(chibber et al., 1986). the assays were performed at 37 “ c
in a buffer containing 10 mm hepes-naoh, ph 7.4, plus
other desired factors. the components present were [glu’ipg
(0.5 pm) and the substrate d-val-leu-lys-p-nitroanilide
(s-2551), at a concentration of 0.5 mm, in a final volume of
0.8 ml. the activation reaction was accelerated by addition
of a known level of two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx . the effects of
cnbr-fg and fibrin on these same activation rates were
conducted at a single concentration (100 mm) of naoac or
nacl.
for titration of the effects of c1- and oac- on this activation
reaction, these same assays were performed with levels of these
anions ranging from 0 to 150 mm. the stimulatory effects
of  xxxd146xxx  and fibrinogen were evaluated by addition of the
desired component to the cuvette prior to initiation of the assay
with two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx . in these latter cases, the total
concentration of c1- oac- was maintained at 150 mm.
absorbancies resulting from appearance of p-nitroanilide
were monitored with time ( t ) at 405 nm on a cary 219 recording spectrophotometer and were converted to the concentration of substrate hydrolyzed by employing an t (1 m,
1 cm, 405 nm) of 10000. initial velocities were calculated
from absorbance ( a ) versus t 2 plots, as previously described
(chibber et al., 1986).
analysis of activation rate data with anions and  xxxd146xxx .
the rate data of [glu’ipg activation by rec- xxxg1766xxx , in the absence and presence of  xxxd146xxx  and various anions, were analyzed by standard lineweaver-burk plots. the mechanistic
treatment, shown in scheme i, was utilized to derive kinetic
equations and was based upon the known ability of the effectors, le.,  xxxd146xxx  and anions, to bind to and cause observable
conformational alterations in [glu’ipg (chibber et al., 1985,
1986; urano et al., 1987a). in scheme i, y is the effector,

results
we have shown previously that an anion inhibitory effect
exists in the activation of human [glu'ipg by sk and  xxxg1767xxx 
(chibber et al., 1985, 1986; urano et al., 1987a,b) and that
the order of effectiveness of anions approximates their
placement in the hofmeister ion series. the data of table
i establish that a similar effect exists for the initial activation
rate of [glu'ipg by two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx . alteration of the
cation, with c1-, f,or oac- as the anion, does not significantly
affect the initial activation rate of [glu'ipg by this enzyme.
however, the nature of the anion does influence this same rate.
an approximate 4-fold rate increase is found through the series
i- > c1- > hc03- > f > oac-. the presence of fibrinogen
serves to stimulate these rates but does not lead to an alteration
of the order of anion effectiveness in this regard.
the effect of various promoters on the long-term activation
of human [glu'ipg by two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx , in the presence of
10 mm hepes-naoh/loo mm nacl, ph 7.4, is shown in
figure 1. for the property of interest, these agents are ordered
as fibrin > cnbr-fg > fibrinogen. while this same activation
of [gluilpg by two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx  with all promoters is much
more rapid when 100 mm naoac is substituted for nacl
(data not shown), their order of effectiveness remains essentially the same. the plot in figure 1 is shown for appreciation
of the overall phenomonological effect only and cannot readily
be employed for a kinetic analysis of [glu'ipg activation by
two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx , since during the long-term activation, na
dodso,/page experiments clearly demonstrate the occurrence of the conversion of [glu'ipg to [ l y ~ ~ ~ lthe
p g latter
,
protein possessing different kinetic properties with this activator
than the former. further, hydrolytic action by the generated
plasmin on the promoters might also influence their stimulatory
properties. the importance of such events are made obvious
by the data of figure 2, wherein the hydrolysis of s-2251
resulting from activation of [glu'ipg by two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx ,
in the presence of fibrin and c1-, is plotted against time
squared. here, a biphasic curve is seen. when this same
experiment is performed with [glu'ipg in oac-, or with
[ l y ~ ~ ~ in
l peither

c1- or oac-, a linear plot is obtained.
these results are clearly consistent with the slower reaction

we have shown previously (urano et al., 198713) that c1places [glu'ipg in an unfavorable conformation for activation

lineweaver-burk analysis of the effect of c1- on the initial
rate of activation (uo) of [glu'ipg by two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx  at 37 oc.
the concentration of [glu'ipg was varied between 0.2 and 2.0 pm,
and the c1-concentrations were (0)none and (a) 5, (0)35, and (a)
100 mm. the calculated rate of activation of [glu'ipg at saturating
c1- is also shown (--). the lines drawn through the data points were
calculated from the iterative procedure described under materials
and methods. in the experiments, the ionic strength was maintained
constant at 150 mm by substitution of an equivalent amount of
naoac with the desired concentration of  xxxg2020xxx . activations were
initiated by addition of two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx  (4.4 nm final concentration). the buffer was 10 mm hepes-naoh, ph 7.4.
figure 4:

kinetics at very short reaction times (<4 min) and with soluble
well-defined promoters. these latter results were compared
to those found with the small molecule positive effector  xxxd146xxx .
under these conditions, in all cases to be described below,
nadodso,/page demonstrated that at the reaction times
employed both [glu'] pg and the effector molecules retained
their respective structural integrities and that, consequently,
we were indeed analyzing the reaction of choice, i.e., the activation of native [glu'ipg by two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx , with the
promoter that was initially presented to the activation system.
figure 4 illustrates a lineweaver-burk plot of the effect
of various concentrations of nacl on the initial rates of activation of [glu'ipg by two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx . such plots were
not linear at [glu'ipg concentrations greater than approximately 2 p m (data not shown), indicating that the inhibition
by nacl is overcome at high concentrations of [glulipg and

suggesting that a second reaction occurs at a higher k, value.
however, at zymogen concentrations below 2 fm the iterative
plots fit the experimental points very well with the kinetic
constants listed. thus, our conclusions are relevant to the
activation reaction that occurs at the lower k,.
in all experiments, typified by the data of figure 4, the ionic
strength was maintained constant at 150 mm, by substitution
of the desired level of c1- for a corresponding amount of oac-;
this latter anion at this concentration exhibits a much smaller
inhibition of the activation of [glu'ipg, as compared to c1-.
over the range of [cl-] that we have examined, i.e., 0-100
mm, a progressive inhibition occurs, primarily due to an effect
on the k , of the reaction.
the influence of  xxxd146xxx  on the initial activation rate of
[glu'ipg with two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx , in 10 mm hepesnaoh/100 mm nacl, ph 7.4, is illustrated in figure 5. a
progressive increase in this reaction occurs as the concentration
of  xxxd146xxx  is altered, from 0 to 2 mm. once again, the influence of  xxxd146xxx  is exerted on the k, of the activation.
 xxxd146xxx  did not stimulate the activation of [glu'ipg when
naoac was substituted for nacl under the above conditions.
the lines drawn through the experimental points of figures
4 and 5 were calculated by the iterative procedure described
under materials and methods. in all cases, the lines show an
excellent fit with the data. the constants provided in figure
6 were calculated with use of the kinetic scheme described

we have also examined the effect of fibrinogen (fg) on the
initial activation rate of [glu'ipg by two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx  in
10 mm hepes-naoh/loo mm nacl, ph 7.4. lineweaver-burk plots of the data obtained are shown in figure 7.
over the range of [fibrinogen] employed, from 0 to 1.7 pm,
a progressive increase in the reaction rate was obtained, due
primarily to a decrease in the apparent k's of the reaction.
a double-reciprocal plot of the change in slopes of the lines
in figure 7 against the concentration of fibrinogen yielded a
linear plot. the plots are consistent with a mechanism of

from the data of figure 7, and appropriate replots (segel,

the two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx -catalyzed activation of [glu'ipg in 10

point was found to be in the second quadrant, suggesting that
both the 6 s and the k,,, had been altered by the promoter.
double-reciprocal plots of the changes in slopes and intercepts
of these lines, against the concentration of fibrinogen, were

serving as a mixed-type nonessential activator, with cy = 0.16

the lineweaver-burk plots of the activation data in the

discussion

figure 8: kinetic constants for the c1- inhibition and fibrinogen
stimulation of [glu'ipg by two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx  (tpa). pm refers
to human plasmin and fg to human fibrinogen.

the purpose of this study was to determine whether the
activation of [glu'ipg by two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx  is influenced by
the normal plasma components, c1- and fibrinogen. it has
been shown previously that a similar activation of [glu'ipg
by two other important activators, sk and  xxxg1767xxx , is strongly
influenced by these same components (chibber et al., 1985,
1986; urano et al., 1987a,b; castellino et al., 1988). the
results of such an investigation with  xxxg1766xxx  are necessary in
considering the manner of regulation of its activity in plasma,
which has possible important implications in the production
of systemic fibrinogenolysis in patients undergoing therapeutic
thrombolytic treatment with  xxxg1766xxx .
the data of table i show that anions inhibit the overall
activation of [glu'ipg by two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx  according to their
relative positions in the hofmeister anion series. this suggests

that the anion site(s) responsible for this effect is (are) of a
general nature and of sufficient flexibility to accommodate
a variety of anions, as was the case for the anion inhibitory
site in the  xxxg1767xxx -catalyzed activation of [glu'ipg. the simplest
kinetic mechanism that is consistent with the steady-state
initial velocity data that are illustrated in figure 6 involves
anion binding to [glu'ipg, with provision of a substrate-anion
complex that possesses a higher k , for the activating enzyme,
two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx . a considerable amount of physical data
is in accord with this view. we have shown previously that
anion binding by [glu'ipg results in a large conformational
alteration in this protein, which is measurable by sedimentation
velocity ultracentrifugation (urano et al., 1987b) and intrinsic
fluorescence enhancement (urano et al., 1987a). this conformationally altered [glu'ipg is less activatible by  xxxg1767xxx 

activation of plasminogen by tpa

(urano et al., 1987b). since a distinct conformational alteration is produced in the substrate, [glu'ipg, consequent to
anion binding, and since anion inhibition of activation is present
with two separate activators, neither of which display anion
inhibition toward small synthetic peptide substrates, it is most
reasonable to suggest that anion interaction with the substrate
is responsible for the inhibitory effects observed. in accord
with this view, other forms of plasminogen which do not undergo a conformational alteration upon anion binding, le.,
[lys7']pg and [va1442]pg,do not show this same inhibitory
effect with c1-. in fact, an opposite trend is noted with these
latter forms of plasminogen, an observation which is the subject
of continuing investigations. therefore, while it is probable
that anions interact separately with the activating enzyme,
two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx , we do not feel that such an equilibrium
is important to the kinetic rate-determining step that describes
the anion inhibitory effects seen with [glu'ipg as the substrate,
and it has not included these interactions in figure 7. a
kinetically important anion- xxxg1766xxx  interaction in complex with
[glu'ipg is not ruled out by the mechanism described.
the k , for the activation of [glu'ipg or [glu'ipg-c1 by
two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx  found in this study is considerably lower
than that published in some previous works (rijken et al.,
1982; hoylaerts et al., 1982). during the course of this investigation, we found that lineweaver-burk plots of the initial
activation rates of [glu'ipg, as a function of the concentration
of [glu'ipg, are distinctly nonlinear at levels of [glu'ipg
greater than approximately 2 pm. thus, we did not employ
zymogen concentrations higher than this level, in contrast to
previously published investigations (rijken et al., 1982;
hoylaerts et al., 1982). the k , does depend upon the nature
of the anion but appears to be in the range of 1-10 pm at the
usual levels of c1- present in most studies to date. the low
k , for this activation reaction which we obtain in the absence
of effectors is more in agreement with the k, value of approximately 7 pm published by ranby (1982).
we show herein that  xxxd146xxx  greatly stimulates the initial
activation rate of [glu'ipg by two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx  in the
presence of anions that have first depressed this same activation
rate. the simplest kinetic mechanism, in 100 mm nacl,
consistent with the effect of this stimulator that is derived from
application of the iterative procedure to the initial rate plots
of figure 5 is shown in figure 6. in this mechanism, we have
invoked the presence of a [glu'] pg-cl- xxxd146xxx  complex, since
we have shown in a previous study (urano et al., 1987b) that
 xxxd146xxx  does not displace c1- from [glu'ipg. in figure 6, we
propose that the major influence of  xxxd146xxx  is to induce a large
decrease in the k, for the [glu'lpg-c1 complex to approximately that of [glu'ipg, in the absence of inhibiting anions.
the k , for the reaction of the [glu'ipg-cl- xxxd146xxx  complex
is lower than that for [glu'ipg, suggesting that a true reversal
by  xxxd146xxx  of the kinetic inhibition by c1- may not be the exact
operative mechanism. however, it should be recalled that
oac- is present in the experiments in the absence of c1-, in
order to maintain the ionic strength of the assay constant, and
unpublished experiments in our laboratory show that oacdoes affect two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx  activity. if all anions are
omitted from the assay, except for the 10 mm hepes-naoh,
ph 7.4, buffer, the k , for [glu'ipg decreases to 0.7 pm, very
nearly the same as that of 0.4 pm found for the [glu'ipgcl- xxxd146xxx  complex. a virtual reversal of anion inhibition by
 xxxd146xxx  was found when  xxxg1767xxx  was employed as the activator
(urano et al., 1987b).
physical-chemical studies of the  xxxd146xxx  effect on [glu'ipg
are in accord with the kinetic mechanism derived from the

vol. 27, n o . 17, 1988

initial rate data. we have shown previously (urano et al.,
1987b), by sedimentation velocity analysis, that  xxxd146xxx  reverses the conformational change produced in [glu'ipg by
anions, a process that yields a conformational state similar to
that of [glu'ipg, in the absence of inhibiting anions. in
addition, [ l ~ s ~ ~ lwhich
p g , exists in a conformation similar to
that of [glu'ipg, in the absence of inhibiting anions, or the
[glu'ipg-cl- xxxd146xxx  complex, was activated with two-chain
rec- xxxg1766xxx  at a rate similar to that of plasminogen, under the
latter two sets of conditions. importantly,  xxxd146xxx  neither
shows a significant ability to alter the conformation of
[lys7*]pgin the absence or presence of c1- (violand et al.,
1975, 1978) nor stimulates the activation rate of this protein
(claeys & vermylen, 1974). thus, the great amount of information accumulated suggests that a conformation exists
(high s) for [glu'ipg, in the presence of anions, such as c1-,
that is poorly activatible by two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx . a large
conformational alteration (low s ) occurs as a result of  xxxd146xxx 
binding to the [glu'ipg-anion complex, which is similar to
that of [glu'ipg, in the absence of anions, and to [ l ~ s ~ ~ l p g
in the presence or absence of anions and  xxxd146xxx . the low s
conformation, readily observable by sedimentation velocity
ultracentrifugation, is a highly activatible form of the protein.
it has been shown that two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx  also interacts with
lysine and  xxxd146xxx  (ichinose et al., 1986), but since these latter
agents do not stimulate the activation of [ l ~ s ~ ~ lwhich
p g , also
binds  xxxd146xxx  (markus et al., 1978), or [va14*]pg, which shows
a greatly diminished capacity for interaction with  xxxd146xxx 
(sottrup-jensen et al., 1977), we do not believe that the
rectctpa- xxxd146xxx  equilibrium is important to the rate-determining step that describes the kinetic mechanism and have
not included this reaction in figure 7. again, however, the
kinetic mechanism does not rule out an  xxxd146xxx - xxxg1766xxx  interaction in complex with [glu'ipg-c1.
the effect of fibrinogen on the initial rates of activation of
[glu'ipg activation, in a c1--containing buffer, is shown in
figure 7. similar, but not identical results were obtained in
oac--containing buffers (described under results). from
these plots and appropriate replots (chibber et al., 1986), the
kinetic mechanism for the fibrinogen stimulatory effects, found
in the presence of both anions, is provided in figure 8. the
key feature of this mechanism is the presence of a rec-t-pafibrinogen complex that is responsible for the rate-determining
step in the kinetic stimulation shown by this positive effector.
since it is well-known that [glu'ipg binds very weakly to fibrin
(rakozci et al., 1978), and also presumably to fibrinogen, we
do not believe that this equilibrium is important to the ratelimiting kinetic step and have not included such an interaction
in figure 8. in addition, our evidence demonstrates that
fibrinogen stimulates the activation of [va142]pg by two-chain
rec- xxxg1766xxx , despite the relative inability of this form of plasminogen to interact with fibrin, suggesting that the plasminogen-fibrin (and likely fibrinogen) interaction is not essential
for stimulation by this promoter. finally, a genetic variant
of rec- xxxg1766xxx , wherein cysza is altered to gly, providing a  xxxg1766xxx 
wherein the two polypeptide chains are not stabilized by a
disulfide bond, activates [glu'ipg at a rate similar to that of
two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx  but does not show as significant a stimulation by fibrinogen or fibrin (s. urano, unpublished experiments) as does native two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx . this strongly
suggests that the fibrinogen-rec- xxxg1766xxx  equilibrium is much
more important to the rate-determining step that describes the
kinetic mechanism than the fibrinogen-[glu'l pg equilibrium,
and this is reflected in the scheme presented in figure 8. once
again, however, the mechanism described does not rule out

6528

b 1och e m i s t r y

a [glu'ipg interaction in complex with two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx .
the mechanism of figure 8 is in essential agreement with the
work of hoylaerts et al. (1982), which showed that the kinetic
mechanism that best describes the activation of [glu'ipg by
 xxxg1766xxx  in the presence of fibrin films was sequential and ordered,
with  xxxg1766xxx  first binding to fibrin followed by binding of the
zymogen. while our mechanism is somewhat similar to that
proposed by hoylaerts et al., (1982), it (as well as theirs)
cannot be described as an obligatory ordered reaction, since
activation does occur in the presence of fibrinogen and fibrin.
in summary, examination of the mechanisms provided in
figures 6 and 8 shows that  xxxd146xxx  and fibrinogen stimulate
the two-chain rec- xxxg1766xxx -catalyzed activation of [glu'ipg in
different manners, the former via effects on the substrate,
[glu'ipg and the latter through effects on the enzyme, twochain rec- xxxg1766xxx . these observations are fortified by the results
showing that  xxxd146xxx  does not stimulate the activation in
oac--containing solutions, since the conformational alteration
that would be produced in [glu'ipg by  xxxd146xxx  has already
occurred. however, fibrinogen does further stimulate activation of [glu'ipg in these same oac- solutions.
finally, the results of this paper provide important information on the control of the rectctpa-catalyzed initial activation rate of native circulating [glu'ipg by normal plasma
components, c1- and fibrinogen. the stimulation of activation
of [glu'ipg that would normally be observed in the presence
of fibrinogen is severely depressed by c1-, in theory allowing
a low level of plasmin production to occur in plasma. in a
microenvironment wherein c1- is depleted, fibrinogen or fibrin
would promote activation of [glu'ipg, leading to increased
amounts of [glu'ipg activation. this aspect of [glu'ipg
activation, and its control by c1-, requires attention in consideration of mechanisms of plasminogen activation in plasma.
