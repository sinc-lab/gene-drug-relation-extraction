inhibition of cellular antioxidants:
a possible mechanism of toxic cell in jury
by charles d. puglia* and saul r. powell*
cells that utilize molecular oxygen generate highly reactive oxygen-derived free radicals. endogenous
cellular oxidants inactivate oxidant free radicals and protect aerobic cells from oxidant injury. glutathione,
 xxxg981xxx , and superoxide dismutase are key components of this antioxidant defense.
inhibition of antioxidant components would be expected to result in cell injury. using exposure to oxygen
at high pressure to increase the level of oxidant free radicals, evidence is presented to support the
hypothesis that inhibition of cellular antioxidants renders organisms more susceptible to oxygen toxicity.
 xxxd1917xxx  at doses of 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg inhibited rat brain superoxide dismutase
activity and shortened onset time to seizures in a dose-related manner in 4 ata oxygen.  xxxd444xxx  at
doses of 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg inhibits  xxxg981xxx  activity in rat brain in proportion to the dose.
time to onset of seizures of rats pretreated with  xxxd444xxx  prior to exposure to 4 ata oxygen was
shortened, and  xxxd2811xxx  levels were increased in the cortex and subcortex. these data suggest
that inhibition of antioxidant components results in organisms becoming more sensitive to oxygen toxicity.
compounds that inhibit cellular antioxidants may produce toxic cell injury by permitting intracellular
oxidant free radicals to attack essential cell constituents.

antioxidant defense mechanisms
all cells that utilize molecular oxygen (02) for metabolic or respiratory purposes are at risk of being
damaged by activated oxygen and other 02 derived free
radicals. the most prevalent form of this species is
thought to be superoxide anion (02w), which is formed
when elemental 02 is utilized as an electron acceptor
during cellular metabolism or respiration. superoxide
anion represents the product of a one-electron reduction
of elemental 02 (1). the aerobic cell possesses many
potential sources of 02t. enzymes that catalyze the
incorporation of molecular 02 to organic molecules,
such as  xxxg2431xxx ,  xxxg168xxx , monoamine
oxidase, nadph- xxxg569xxx  reductase, nadphcytochrome p450 reductase, certain hydroxylases, and
several flavoproteins generate 02t. certain auto-oxidation reactions, such as those of ubisemiquinone, catechols, ferrodoxins, and hemoproteins, as well as autooxidation of sulfhydryl groups may result in production of
02t (2). certain metallic ions (e.g.,  xxxd2385xxx ) catalyze the reduction of elemental 02 to 02t (3)
02t will react with electron acceptors in the immediate vicinity. reactants for 02t are sulfhydryl groups
such as those located at enzyme-active sites, and
unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  such as those located in membrane lipids. indiscriminate and unfocused reactions of

this type could result in inactivation of enzymes and
damage to membranes. maintenance of normal cell
structure and function in the presence of the constant
production of highly reactive oxidant species depends
upon the presence of an effective system for inactivating
them. most 02-utilizing cells contain a multicomponent
antioxidant defense mechanism for this purpose.
the endogenous cellular antioxidant mechanism, as
currently recognized in aerobic cells, consists of a
number of components. superoxide dismutase (sod)
catalyzes the dismutation of 02t to h202 and 02 in
mammalian tissues this enzyme is known to exist in two
forms: a cytosolic, cu-zn enzyme, and a mitochondrial
mn enzyme (4).
in mammalian systems, sod activity tends to be
highest in tissues that have high 02 utilization (5). in
addition, tissue sod content has been shown to vary
with tissue po in normal air-breathing mice (6). this
suggests that the function of sod is to prevent toxic cell
damage from a normal metabolic by-product of 02.
glutathione (gsh), a sulfhydryl containing tripeptide
(y-glutamyl-cysteinylglycine), appears to play a multifaceted role as an antioxidant in this system. glutathione
maintains the reduced state of the sulfhydryl groups of
a number of sulfhydryl-dependent enzymes (7). endogenously generated hydroperoxides and other 02 intermediates (8) are inactivated via the enzyme gsh peroxidase, which utilizes gsh as a proton donor. because
gsh has a strong reducing potential, it can also act as a
nonspecific, nonenzymatic scavenger of free radicals
produced by 02 (9). whether gsh interacts with

308

puglia and powell

oxidants enzymatically or nonenzymatically, the byproduct is  xxxd2811xxx  ( xxxd2811xxx ).
the reduction of  xxxd2811xxx  is catalyzed by the enzyme
gsh reductase utilizing nadph as an electron donor.
nadph is supplied by the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (g-6-pdh). like sod, gsh levels tend
to be highest in those tissues with the highest utilization of 02 (7)
adequate levels of gsh reductase and nadph are
critical to the maintenance of gsh in the reduced state
which is necessary for the defense of the cell against
attack by oxidant free radicals (10). increased g-6-pdh
activity has been demonstrated in the lungs of rats
exposed to hyperoxic gaseous environments (11).
other components of the cellular antioxidant defense
system are tocopherol ( xxxd3521xxx ) and ascorbate
( xxxd228xxx ). tocopherol can act as a lipid antioxidant
(2). ascorbate appears to be able to reduce the tocopherol free radical that is formed when tocopherol reduces
an oxidant substance. this interaction may explain, in
part, the synergistic antioxidant effect of tocopherol
and ascorbate in suppressing lipid peroxidation in an in
vitro system (12). the intracellular antioxidant defense
system whose components have been described above,
has evolved to prevent toxic cell injury from oxidant free
radicals produced during normal metabolic and respiratory processes.

cellular oxidant damage
much of the evidence indicating that oxidant species
can adversely affect cellular constituents has been
obtained by exposure of animals to environments containing elevated levels of oxidant substances. inspiration of 02 at increased partial pressures has been
demonstrated to produce toxicity in both man and
experimental animals. this toxicity occurs as a result of
the increased production of oxidant free radicals (e.g.,
02t, hydroxyl radicals and peroxides) secondary to the
increased intracellular 02 tension. for certain enzymatic reactions, the production of 02- increases as the
partial pressure of 02 increases (13). oxygen toxicity in
intact animals is demonstrated most frequently as
effects on the lung and central nervous system.
according to the theory of intracellular antioxidant
defenses, the intracellular concentration of oxidant free
radicals occurring as a result of exposure to hyperoxia
exceeds the capacity of the antioxidant defense mechanisms to inactivate and detoxify these reactive species.
evidence in support of this proposed sequence of events
is provided by the characteristic lag or onset time
observed between the initiation of the exposure of the
animal to the hyperoxic environment and the appearance of the manifestations of toxicity (14). the time to
onset of gross toxicity is inversely related to the
pressure of 02 to which the animal is exposed (i.e., the
higher the 02 dose, the shorter the time to onset). this
relationship has been observed in the manifestations of
02 toxicity in whole animals (14), as well as in the toxic

effects of 02 on isolated tissues (15) and cells in culture
(16). the time required for the toxic effects of 02 to
occur as a function of oxygen pressure can be interpreted as an indication of the antioxidant defense capacity
of a particular tissue or cell. from this view, the time to
onset of toxic effect would represent the time required
for that quantity of 02 to overcome the antioxidant
capacity of the cell and begin to attack cellular constituents which then give rise to the toxic effect.
auto-oxidation of both nonprotein (17) and protein
sulfhydryls (18) by reactive 02 intermediates with
subsequent loss of enzyme activity has been postulated
as a key mechanism of 02 toxicity. exposure of animals
to high pressure 02 inhibits sulfhydryl dependent
enzymes, in vivo, e.g.,  xxxg913xxx  (19,20)
and lactate dehydrogenase (21). exposure of tissue
preparations to high 02 tensions results in inhibition of
many enzymes thought to be sulfhydryl-dependent,
e.g.,  xxxg138xxx  (22), na+,k+-atpase
(15,23). an important aspect of the interaction of
sulfhydryls with toxic 02 intermediates is that gsh
cannot only prevent 02 inactivation of certain enzymes
by being preferentially oxidized but can also reactivate
02 inactivated enzymes (22). both of these protective
and/or restorative functions of gsh depend upon the
maintenance of gsh in the reduced form by gsh
reductase and the nadph provided by g-6-pdh.
interaction of the 02- or other reduction products of
02 with unsaturated tissue  xxxd2154xxx  may result in the

inhibition of endogenous antioxidants

formation of lipid free radicals (24). in the presence of
02, the lipid free radical can undergo auto-oxidation to a
lipid peroxide. the lipid peroxide thus formed can react
with other unsaturated lipids to generate a lipid
hydroperoxide and the regeneration of another oxidant
lipid radical. this results in a cyclical reaction and
the continuous reformation of lipid peroxides (11,25).
the significance of lipid peroxidation is twofold; first,
progressive lipid peroxidation may result in loss of
cellular membrane integrity; second-at least in vitro
-inactivation of enzymes by lipid peroxides has been
demonstrated, and thus loss of enzyme function may
occur (26).
the rate of oxidation of these cellular constituents is
dependent upon the level of 02 available to provide
oxidant free radicals and the quantity and level of
activity of the antioxidant defense components which
must first be exhausted.

impairment of endogenous
antioxidants
evidence that impaired antioxidant defense mechanisms could result in adverse effects on cell function is
exemplified by the clinical syndrome associated with
g-6-pdh deficiency. patients having erythocytes deficient in this enzyme exhibit decreased red blood cell
survival time and increased sensitivity to drugs which
present the red cell with an increased level of oxidants
(27). the nature of the cell damage indicates a primary
target to be the lipids of the red cell membrane (27).
experimentally, impairment of the endogenous antioxidants has been attempted by using two methods: (1)
directly by pharmacologic manipulation of one or more
of the endogenous antioxidants or (2) indirectly by
affecting the nutritional status of the experimental
animal resulting in a deficiency of an antioxidant
constituent. experimental nutritional deficiency in rats
has been shown to affect susceptibility to 02 toxicity.
rats maintained on a cysteine-deficient diet develop
pathologic changes indicative of pulmonary 02 toxicity
earlier and have a decreased survival time when exposed to 98% 02 at 1 ata (atmospheres absolute). addition of 3% cysteine to their diet reversed both effects.
presumably, this effect was due to a deficiency of lung
gsh. exposure of cysteine-supplemented rats to 97%
02 for 60 hr resulted in a significant increase in lung
gsh content when compared to the cysteine-deprived
rats similarly exposed (28).
dietary deprivation of selenium renders rats more
susceptible to 02 pulmonary damage. this effect was
associated with a decrease in lung gsh-peroxidase
activity (29).
exposure of tocopherol-deficient mice to 45 psia
(pounds per square inch absolute) 02 for 1 hr results in a
higher incidence of seizures. in these studies, tocopherol deficiency is associated with increases in brain
content of peroxide and lipid peroxides following 02.

exposure. as with the cysteine-deprived rats, these
effects were reversible upon addition of tocopherol to
the diet (30,31).
pharmacological manipulation of the endogenous antioxidants has been attempted using several agents.
 xxxd1917xxx  (ddc) is an inhibitor of the
cu-zn sod (32). treatment of rats with this compound
has been demonstrated to potentiate pulmonary damage in rats exposed to 95% 02 at 1 ata (33) and to
decrease survival time of rats exposed to 95% 02 at 1
ata (33) or 2 ata 100% 02 (34).
in our laboratory, experiments with ddc have been
conducted to ascertain the relationship of central nervous system sod inhibition in brain on the rate of
development of cns 02 toxicity. tieatment of rats with
ddc at doses of 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg, ip, results in
a dose-dependent decrease in time to seizure in rats
exposed to 4 ata 100% 02. the effect on time to seizure
was in the presence of a dose-dependent decrease in
brain cu-zn sod activity (35).
this laboratory has also been examining the effect of
inhibition of gsh reductase on rate of development of
cns 02 toxicity.  xxxd444xxx  or
 xxxd444xxx  was first demonstrated to produce a generalized inhibition of gsh reductase by frischer and
ahmad (36). treatment of rats with  xxxd444xxx  intravenously, at doses of 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg, produces a

dose-dependent decrease in time to seizure at 4 ata
100% 02. these doses of  xxxd444xxx  also resulted in a
dose-dependent inhibition of brain gsh reductase
activity. furthermore, the decreased time of onset of
seizures was associated with increased  xxxd2811xxx  content of
the cortex and subcortex. this suggests that inhibition
of brain gsh reductase in the presence of an oxidizing
environment alters the gsh status of neuronal tissue
and thus increases the sensitivity of this tissue to the
toxic effects of 02 (37).
in all the experiments cited above, evidence of tissue
damage was demonstrated in an environment which
exposed cells to significantly elevated levels of 02. the
cellular antioxidant defenses normally function to protect cellular constituents from endogenously derived
oxidant free radicals generated in cells exposed to 0.2
ata 02 in sea level air. inhibition of antioxidant
components would be expected to result in 02-mediated
cell injury even in normoxic environments. according to
the 02 dose-toxic response relationship the rate of
development of oxidant toxic cell injury would be
dependent upon the extent as well as the duration of
antioxidant inhibition, since 02 dose would remain
constant. based on the existing onset times for the
various manifestations of 02 toxicity, measurable normoxic 02 toxicity may be expected to require days or
perhaps weeks to occur. the ability of exogenous
substances to impair cellular antioxidants may represent a significant mechanism of toxic cell injury by
endogenously generated oxidant species.
