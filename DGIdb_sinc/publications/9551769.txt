methamphetamine modulates gaba-induced electrophysiological depression
by alternating noradrenergic actions in cerebellar purkinje neurons

received: 21 april 1997 / final version: 1 august 1997

abstract previous studies have indicated that caminobutyric acid (gaba)-induced electrophysiological responses can be enhanced by noradrenaline
(ne) acting via b-adrenergic receptors. methamphetamine (ma) has been reported to be a noradrenergic
releasing agent. in the present study, we examined the
interaction of ma and gaba in cerebellar purkinje
neurons of urethane-anesthetized rats. we found that
local application of ma did not potentiate gabainduced electrophysiological depressions in purkinje
neurons. since ma may act indirectly or directly on a
or b noradrenergic receptors, we further examined the
interactions of ma with selective noradrenergic antagonists. we found that after blocking a-adrenergic receptors with  xxxd3000xxx , ma signiþcantly facilitated gaba
responses. on the other hand, co-administration of  xxxd3377xxx  with ma did not attenuate gaba-induced neuronal depressions. to examine further the interactions
between a and b receptors in modulating gaba
response, we found that stimulation of a-adrenergic
receptors in the absence of b receptor activation, such
as by application of the a-agonist phenylephrine alone,
did not decrease gaba-induced inhibition. however,
stimulation of a-adrenergic receptors in the presence of
b-receptor activation, such as by co-application of
phenylephrine and the b-agonist  xxxd2401xxx  (iso),
attenuated iso-facilitated gaba inhibition. taken
together, these data suggest that ma may activate two
noradrenergic modulatory mechanisms: b-adrenergic
receptor-induced gaba potentiation and a-adrenergic inhibition, which attenuates b-mediated modulation. in conclusion, our data suggest that ma may
regulate gaba-induced electrophysiological response
by altering both the a- and b-noradrenergic inputs in
cerebellar purkinje neurons.

introduction
noradrenaline (ne) has been considered not only a
neurotransmitter but also a neuromodulator in
di¤erent brain regions. its neuromodulatory role may
inßuence a number of physiological and pathological
functions, such as learning (bickford 1993) and schizophrenia (freedman 1977). previous reports indicate
that activation of noradrenergic neurons modulates the
electrophysiological depressant e¤ect of c- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) (moises et al. 1979; moises and
woodward 1980; lee et al. 1995). local application of
ne or  xxxd2401xxx  (iso) facilitates gaba-induced
depression in cerebellar purkinje neurons (parþtt et al.
1990; lin et al. 1993b; sessler et al. 1995; freund and
palmer 1996). electrical stimulation of noradrenergic
input in the locus coeruleus also potentiates cerebellar
gaba responses, an e¤ect which can be antagonized
by b-adrenergic antagonists. analogs of camp, facilitate gaba-induced depressions of neuronal þring in
a manner similar to ne (siggins et al. 1969; ho¤er
et al. 1971). furthermore, the amplitude of gabainduced currents in purkinje neurons can be potentiated by increasing intracellular camp levels (cheun
and yeh 1996). taken together, these data suggest that
b-adrenergic receptors and camp are involved in the
ne-mediated modulation of gaba-ergic response in
cerebellar purkinje neurons.
cerebellar purkinje neurons also contain a-adrenergic receptors in addition to b-adrenergic receptors. it
has been shown that direct depressant e¤ects of ne in
purkinje neurons can be antagonized by phenoxybenzamine (staunton et al. 1988), but not  xxxd3377xxx  (parþtt
et al. 1988). direct application of the a1-agoninst
phenylephrine inhibited purkinje cell þring rate. this

133

phenylephrine e¤ect was antagonized by  xxxd3000xxx  but
not by  xxxd3377xxx  (parþtt et al. 1988). these data suggest
that purkinje neurons have distinct neuronal responses
to a- and b-adrenergic agonists (granholm and palmer
1988). it is still not known whether the electrophysiological actions of gaba can be modulated by a-receptors.
amphetamine and its analogs interact primarily
with monoaminergic mechanisms in the brain (azzaro
and rutledge 1973; raiteri et al. 1975). amphetamine
may either facilitate the release or block uptake of catecholamines (azzaro and rutledge 1973; raiteri et al.
1975; bennett et al. 1993). it has been demonstrated,
using microdialysis, that systemic application of
amphetamine (2 mg / kg, ip) increases ne release from
a basal level of 810 pg / 20 µl to 400 450 pg / 20 µl in
the cerebellum (krobert et al. 1994). on the other hand,
amphetamine also directly acts on post-synaptic noradrenergic receptors (smith 1963; kostopoulos and
yarbrough 1975). therefore, methamphetamine (ma)
may modify gaba-induced e¤ects via noradrenergic
mechanisms. we previously reported that ma facilitates  xxxd102xxx induced responses in the presence of  xxxd3000xxx  (wang et al. 1995). similarly, iso enhances
 xxxd102xxx induced depressions of purkinje neuron þring
(lin et al. 1994). it is thus possible that the ma-potentiated ethanol reaction is secondarily mediated through
the modulation of gaba response by b-adrenergic
activation.
the purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction between ma and gaba. our data indicate that
ma modulates gaba-induced neuronal depression
via both a- and b-noradrenergic mechanisms.

materials and methods
adult (250350 g) male sprague-dawley rats (n = 39) were anesthetized with urethane (1.25 g / kg, ip), intubated, and placed in a
stereotaxic frame. body temperature was maintained at 37°c by a
heating pad / thermistor circuit. the cisterna magna was opened to
reduce brain pulsation, and the skull and other superþcial tissues
over the cerebellar vermis were removed. the dura was opened to
expose the underlying brain which was covered with 2 % agar.

electrophysiology
single extracellular action potentials were recorded using multibarrel micropipettes (palmer et al. 1980). the tip diameter of the
pipette was 4.05.0 µm. the recording barrels contained 5 m nacl
and had resistances of 2.53.0 momega. the other pipette barrels were
þlled with gaba and adrenergic drugs, including  xxxd2401xxx 
(iso), ma,  xxxd3377xxx  or phenylephrine. drugs were delivered by
micropressure ejection using a pneumatic pressure system ( xxxg1308xxx ,
medical system, great neck, new york, usa). the drug dosage
was quantiþed as the product of the pressure (psi or pound per
square inches) and the duration (s) of ejection. extracellular action
potentials, recorded from single neurons, were þltered, ampliþed,
and isolated by a window discriminator. the þring rates were integrated over 1-s time intervals, and displayed as ratemeter records

on a strip chart recorder. the average þring rate was digitized from
the strip chart recordings through a computer digitizer
(summergraphics) and averaged by a pc computer. similar calculation method has been used in many literatures (wang et al. 1987,
1995; freedman et al. 1975; parþtt et al. 1990). gaba-induced
inhibition was calculated by comparing the decrease in average þring
rate 15 s after the beginning of the drug application with the average þring rate 120 s before such application:
gaba-induced inhibition (before iso) = 1 [average þring rate
15 s after the onset of gaba application (in the absence of
iso) / average þring rate before the onset of this gaba application (in the absence of iso)].
gaba-induced inhibition (during iso) = 1 [average þring rate
15 s after the onset of gaba application (in the presence of
iso) / average þring rate before the onset of this gaba application (in the presence of iso)].

drugs and chemicals
gaba,  xxxd2401xxx  (iso), methamphetamine (ma),  xxxd3000xxx 
(pra),  xxxd3377xxx  (tim), phenylephrine (phe) were purchased from
the sigma company, st louis, mo., usa. all drugs applied by
pressure microejection were dissolved in 0.9 % nacl (ph 7.0). pra
was administered ip at a dose of 1 mg / kg. the drug concentrations
in the microelectrode barrels were: gaba,10[3 m; iso, 10[4 m;
ma, 10[8 m; tim, 10[4 m; and phe 10[4 m.

statistical analysis
results are expressed as mean ± sem. the data were analyzed by
paired t-test or one-way analysis of variance (anova) followed
by newman-keuls test or fisher exact test as indicated in the text
and þgure legends.

results
a total of 96 cerebellar purkinje neurons from 39 animals were studied electrophysiologically. local application of gaba produced inhibition of spontaneous
activity in all neurons studied. previous experiments
have demonstrated that ionotophoretic application of
iso facilitates gaba-induced depression in cerebellar
purkinje neurons (waterhouse et al. 1982; sessler et al.
1989; lin et al. 1993b). in 33 neurons studied, we found
that locally applied iso potentiated gaba-induced
depressions from 24.4 ± 1.4 % (mean ± sem) to 31.3 ±
2.1 % (p < 0.01, paired t-test). local application of the
indirect ne agonist ma did not alter the gabainduced depressions (30.7 ± 1.8 % versus 30.2 ± 3.7 %,
p > 0.8, paired t-test, n = 32). a typical ratemeter
record is shown in fig. 1.
previous investigations have suggested that ne facilitates gaba-induced depressions through b adrenergic receptors (moises et al. 1979; moises and
woodward 1980; lin et al. 1993b). on the other hand,
a-agonists often produced e¤ects opposite to those
resulting from b-adrenergic activation (gilman 1984;
granholm and palmer 1988). since ma has both indirect a- and b-adrenergic activity, the lack of an

co-application of iso (a2 versus a1). in another neuron, local

(b2 versus b1). in this and in all succeeding ratemeter records,

ma-induced modulatory e¤ect on gaba responses
could be due to the combination of a- and b-e¤ects. in
fact, we found that while the a-adrenergic antagonist
 xxxd3000xxx  itself did not alter gaba-induced responses,
application of  xxxd3000xxx  increased the incidence
(table 1) and magnitude (fig. 2a) of ma-induced
potentiation of gaba. we locally applied ma to 32
single neurons and found that gaba-induced depressions were enhanced (> 10 %) by co-administration of
ma in only 44 % (14 of 32) of neurons studied.
however, after systemic application of  xxxd3000xxx , ma
enhanced gaba responses in eight of eight neurons
studied (table 1, p < 0.05, fisher exact test). the average gaba inhibition was potentiated from
29.2 ± 7.1 % to 56.5 ± 7.0 % (fig. 3, p < 0.005, paired
t-test, n = 8). the potentiation of the gaba response

fig. 2 ma potentiated the inhibitory e¤ect of gaba in prazocintreated rats, but the ma / gaba interaction was not a¤ected by
co-application of  xxxd3377xxx  (tim). the animal was systemically
injected with  xxxd3000xxx  (1 mg / kg, ip). local application of ma
resulted in direct depressant e¤ect in this neuron. the gaba-mediated depression was reversibly potentiated by co-administration of
ma in this representative  xxxd3000xxx -treated rat (a2 versus a1). in
another neuron from a rat in which  xxxd3000xxx  was not injected,
gaba-mediated depressions were not a¤ected by local application
(17 psi × 60 s) of b antagonist- xxxd3377xxx  (b2 versus b1)

discussion

fig. 3 ma potentiates gaba-induced neuronal depression in the
presence of  xxxd3000xxx . histograms represent the average neuronal
depression induced by gaba application before (open bar) and
after (hatched bar) ma application. application of ma alone (control) or ma with  xxxd3377xxx  did not alter gaba  induced inhibition.
co-administration ma with  xxxd3000xxx  (1 mg / kg) signiþcantly
potentiated the depressant e¤ect of gaba (*p < 0.005, paired
t-test)

e¤ects of gaba via the a-adrenergic receptor, which
opposes the positive modulatory mechanism (potentiation of gaba depression) via actions on b-adrenergic receptors.
to test this hypothesis further, we looked at other
interaction paradigms. we found that local application
of the b receptor antagonist  xxxd3377xxx  did not attenuate
gaba-induced neuronal depression in the presence of
ma (fig. 2b), and the average gaba inhibition in 12
neurons studied was not altered by  xxxd3377xxx  (fig. 3,
33.1 ± 7.1 % versus 40.6 ± 8.9 %, p > 0.1, paired t-test).
local application of the a-adrenergic receptor agonist
phe also did not attenuate gaba-induced depressions in 11 neurons studied (fig. 4a, average data:
before phe: 27.8 ± 3.8 % versus after phe: 31.9 ±
3.7 %, p > 0.3, paired t-test, n = 11), suggesting that
activation of a-receptors alone does not attenuate
gaba-induced neuronal depressions. on the other
hand, administration of phe signiþcantly attenuated
iso-facilitated gaba responses (fig. 4b). in 33 neurons studied, 24 neurons (73 %) showed iso potentiated gaba-induced electrophysiological depression.
the incidence of iso-induced gaba depression was
signiþcantly decreased after co-administration of phe.
only two of the 25 neurons (8 %) studied developed
gaba potentiation in the presence of iso and phe
(p < 0.05, fisher exact test). the magnitude of isofacilitated gaba-depression was also attenuated by
phe. local application of gaba induced a 24.4 ±
1.4 % depression (n = 33); co-administration of gaba
with iso signiþcantly potentiated gaba depressions
to 31.1 ± 2.1 % (p < 0.05, n = 33, one-way anova +
newman-keuls test). such iso-elicited gaba potentiation was reduced by phe to 21.0 ± 1.3 % (p < 0.05,
one-way anova + newman-keuls test, n = 25).

we and others have previously reported that gabamediated electrophysiological depressions in cerebellar
purkinje neurons can be modulated by increasing
synaptic ne concentrations (moises and woodward
1980; wang and lee 1989; wang et al. 1990; lin et al.
1993a). activation of locus coeruleus or blocking ne
uptake signiþcantly increased synaptic ne content and
enhanced gaba-elicited depressions in cerebellar
purkinje neurons (wang et al. 1992; wang 1994). this
modulation is mediated through b-adrenergic receptors
(moise et al. 1981; waterhouse et al. 1982; sessler et al.
1989) and camp second messenger mechanisms
(ho¤er et al. 1971; ho¤er and freedman 1976).
stimulations of a-versus b-adrenergic receptors have
distinct e¤ects in the cerebellum. the inhibitory e¤ects
of ne on purkinje neuron þring are mediated via an
a receptor mechanism (parþtt et al. 1988; staunton et
al. 1988), while the excitations caused by ne involve
b-receptors (granholm and palmer 1988). beta-receptor agonists were found to increase camp production
in the cerebellum (karbon and enna 1984; cheun and
yeh 1996). on the other hand, a-receptor agonists were
found to decrease  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp production in cerebral cortical slices (duman and enna 1986).
a1-agonists, but not a2- or b-agonists, increase cytoplasmic calcium signaling in cerebellar purkinje neurons (kirischuk et al. 1996). it has been reported that
ma may directly and indirectly interact with a-adrenergic receptors (smith 1963; kostopoulos and
yarbrough 1975; wang et al. 1995). in this study, we
found that following blockade of a-receptors with  xxxd3000xxx , ma potentiates gaba-induced inhibition, suggesting ma may produce a negative modulatory e¤ect
on gaba action through a-receptors. taken together,
these data suggest that ma may activate a- and breceptors to modulate inversely gaba responses in the
cerebellum, the a-receptor  induced action attenuates
the potentiation of gaba e¤ect produced by b-adrenergic receptor activation.
to support this hypothesis, we found that pheinduced activation of a-receptors alone did not inhibit
gaba responses. however, phe signiþcantly attenuated gaba responses, which were augmented by the
b-adrenergic agonist iso. blocking b-receptors with
 xxxd3377xxx  did not attenuate gaba inhibition in the presence of ma. these data suggest that a-receptor 
induced negative modulation becomes manifest only
after b-receptors are activated. similar interactions
have also been reported for dopamine d1 and d2
receptors; activation of d2 receptors inhibits d1 agonist-induced increases in camp levels in the striatum,
while not a¤ecting basal levels (stoof and kebabian
1981). moreover, application of the a-receptor agonist
6-ßuoronoradrenaline attenuates  xxxd1742xxx -activated
camp accumulation (duman and enna 1986). we
recently reported that blocking a-adrenergic receptors

136

attenuates b-adrenergic
receptor-induced gaba
potentiation. local application
of phenylephrine (phe) did
not a¤ect the gaba-mediated
inhibitory e¤ect in a purkinje
neuron (a2 versus a1). local
application of  xxxd2401xxx

gaba-induced depression
(b2 versus b1).
phe antagonized
iso-mediated gaba
facilitation (b3 versus b2)

with  xxxd3000xxx  in the presence of ma potentiates
ethanol  induced depressions in the cerebellar purkinje
neurons (wang et al. 1995). this may also involve badrenergic receptor mechanisms. the lack of modulation of gaba by ma alone reported here may thus
be attributed to the opposing actions of a- and b-receptor in purkinje neurons.
it is known that a-receptor activation may alter
camp production (daly et al. 1981), pi turnover
(duman et al. 1986), and / or calcium concentration
(kirischuk et al. 1996) in neurons. it is still not clear
which subcellular mechanism is involved in the antagonism of b-receptor-induced gaba modulation. our
preliminary experiment indicates that phenylephrine
does not attenuate dibutyryl camp-induced gaba
facilitation, which suggests that the a-receptor 
induced negative modulation may not involve, or occur

at levels preceding,  xxxg67xxx  activation in the
camp cascade mechanism.
previous reports suggest that the modulation of
gaba responses by catecholamines may be involved
in certain symptoms of schizophrenia (freedman
1977). our data indicate that gaba responses can be
modulated by ma through the activation of a receptor and b receptors (granholm and palmer 1988). since
a- and b-receptors are di¤erentially distributed in the
cns (jones et al. 1985; bartolome et al. 1987; schotte
and leysen 1989), administration of ma may di¤erentially alter gaba responses in the various brain
regions. furthermore, ma is known to produce a
thought disorder resembling psychosis. it is possible
that modulation of the gaba response reported
here may, in part, underlie ma-induced mental dysfunction.

137

in conclusion, our data suggested that ma can regulate gaba-induced electrophysiological response in
cerebellar purkinje neurons by altering noradrenergic
inputs. ma may activate both the a- and b-noradrenergic modulatory mechanisms: b-adrenergic receptorinduced gaba potentiation and a-adrenergic
inhibition, which attenuates b-mediated modulation.
